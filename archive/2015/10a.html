We here at fanficWorld have been waiting eagerly to hear more of your stories, but... er... we&#39;re having slight issues with the servers at the moment. I&#39;m afraid the forces of Imperial Liechtenstein have found us again.<br><br>Be not afraid: the fight is going well, and we will certainly win out against the oppressors in due course. But for the time being, things are going to be... a little slow.<br><br>But don&#39;t let that stop you! Go forth and write all your PPC fanfiction, right here, right now!  And may-<br><br>-what? Support@fanficworld, did you say someth-<br><br>Oh, right. DIE, LIECHTENSTEIN SC-*kzzt*<br><br><hr>
<br><br>Or, in other words... welcome to the PPC Badfic Game 2015.<br><br><b>What is this?</b> This is the thread where we let our inner badfic writers have free rein. All PPC stories are technically fanfics of the Original Series - but they&#39;re all goodfics. That&#39;s clearly unreasonable - most fanfic of anything is terrible. So this is your chance to write the baddest of the badfics. Go nuts!<br><br><b>Who can I write about?</b> Any agents in the PPC are open for you to mutilate. There&#39;s a Creativity Shield around ffW, so everything here is emphatically uncanon. The only exception is that, if someone asks in this thread that their agents not be used, please honour that. I can&#39;t imagine why you <i>would</i>, but the offer&#39;s there.<br><br><b>Where do I post?</b> In this thread, please. As you can see, fanficWorld itself won&#39;t be involved in this year&#39;s game - I don&#39;t have the energy for archiving right now.<br><br><b>What name should I post under?</b> You should come up with the badficauthorest name you can, of course! <a href="http://fanfic_land.webs.com/FfW/PPCIndex.htm">Take a look at some of our previous examples.</a><br><br><b>What sort of story should I write?</b> A bad one! Obviously. But also one that&#39;s fun to read. Illegible ultra-typo stories are a bit boring after the first one, y&#39;know?<br><br><b>Can I leave reviews?</b> Emphatically yes - that&#39;s half the fun of the game! But do remember to leave them in character - and equally, remember that the flames you receive are <i>not</i> real flames. They&#39;re a game. Don&#39;t get upset.<br><br><b>Do I need a beta?</b> Hahahahahahahaha. Don&#39;t be ridiculous. ^-^ What sort of badfic writer has a beta?<br><br><b>Do I need Permission?</b> Again, what sort of badfic writer asks permission? (No. No you don&#39;t)<br><br><b>Why are we doing this?</b> Because it&#39;s fun!<br><br>hS</p>

The lippy went into her bra strap in case she needed to reapply it later, but only because the F-sized cups were fully occupied by her soft, mocha-tinted twins. Upon reflection, she decided to hide a little something extra in her ample cleavage. Hopefully it would be a pleasant surprise.<br><br>She slipped slinkily into the bruise-purple latex suit, adjusting the transparent gas mask over the top so that passers-by could see just who she was - the thought of them seeing her and knowing her for the slut she truly was made her shiver with incalculable pleasure. It clung to her ample frame deliciously, the rubber squeaking and straining as her gorgeously firm twin sticky toffee puddings of buttocks were forced into its tight embrace. Her long hair of raven was decorated with golden chains, like stars in a winter&#39;s night, and the zipper on the front of the suit pushed her wondrous cleavage up further, like two giant Maltesers half-dipped in the nice plum sauce you get served in upmarket Chinese restaurants. She looked very much like she felt she deserved to look; like an object, suitable for one use alone; the pleasure of others, sometimes her fellow women, sometimes her betters.<br><br>Time Lord hauteur was all very well, but it totally disintegrated when presented with a genuine alpha male, the daddy she&#39;d never had, the strong presence she&#39;d always craved.<br><br><i>God,</i> she thought, <i>I&#39;m getting juiced up just thinking about it.</i><br><br>She checked her zips were all firmly zipped - not that a good tug from a brawny, hairy, <i>manly</i> arm wouldn&#39;t free her body for use - and, with a wiggle her dusky, bootylicious bod was forced to give from the rubber suit&#39;s built-in eight-inch stripper heels, she set off in pursuit of her incentive, her <i>raisondette</i>, her reason for being. A proud and beautifully alpha man.<br><br>A man such as Agent Supernumerary.<br><br>This man was tall and strong, his customary suit hiding the body of a veritable Adonis, his regal demeanour and pale skin as sharp and striking a contrast to the Notary&#39;s seductively exotic shade as his perfectly-tailored black Hugo Boss suit and tie were to the woman&#39;s latex and heels that left both so little and so much to a suitably red-blooded imagination. Numesy, as he let his peers call him, had finished his daily workout in the gym, and was therefore rereading <i>The Fountainhead</i>. Some of the other agents meditated in their time off, but that was something only sissies did. The real man, Numesy knew, was always at peace with himself; if one had to find it by sitting still and humming in the manner of some foreign mystic or other, well, that was indicative of bluepill-thinker status.<br><br>The door opened and in she walked, a vision in slippery-slick rubber and the gas mask that (to the delight of all) prevented her from speaking, only grunting... or moaning. Numesy barely even bothered to look up; idly, he stubbed out his cigarillo in the cut-glass ashtray and pointed to his knee with it, turning a page with his thumb and nodding sagely at another of Ayn Rand&#39;s beautifully expressed ideas. Alas, reading it again would have to wait.<br><br>The Notary giggled a little in anticipation as she tottered over to the alpha male&#39;s knee, though (knowing her place) she took the time to pour him another Bourbon and let the ice plink into the glass before bending over him, her fecund, purpure rump wiggling in delight at the thought of what she was about to receive. Numesy, on the other hand, was entirely unmoved. He was a male; she was a female; this was simply how things were. She was prepared for his manliness as might any female in the animal kingdom for her commanding and controlling alpha, or as she might have done in days gone by before the SJWs had taken over the media and Internet. He simply closed his hardback <i>The Fountainhead</i> - as a real man, he had no need of a bookmark, knowing what page he had been on - and switched to <i>Anthem</i> instead. He always had liked a good horror story.<br><br>A single swish through the air to test his swing, and Numesy brought the hardback volume of <i>The Fountainhead</i> down hard across the Notary&#39;s jiggling, latex-covered buttocks, the two plump hillocks of such chocolatey delight they might have been found in bowls of Coco Pops allowing a delicious rush of submissive desire and lust for the hand of a real man to run through her slender but amply-tittied form. Again the book fell, as hard as he bothered to, while all the Notary could do was lean forward and let her whole body move to the blows, womanly chest bouncing and swaying (her breasts were those of a real woman, which is to say entirely natural), backside reddening beneath the semi-translucent latex of her slinky, gracefully feminine catsuit - and when it came to people of her colour, the fact that she was reddening up as quickly as she was right then was a testament to Numesy&#39;s majesty as a real dominant man, for only an alpha male of the highest rank and order could raise such a beautiful shade of crimson from a humble, womanly bootay in such a short space of time.<br><br>The spanking went on until Numesy had finished reading <i>Anthem</i>, during which the Notary was brought to dizzyingly intense orgasms simply from being so close to such a perfect incarnation of masculinity, and would have been even had he not been obliged by her very presence to swat her twin hip-mounted spacehoppers with the pinnacle of Objectivist literature, and therefore literature in general. He closed the book, crashed the other into the Notary&#39;s beautifully ripe backside one final, deliciously sensual time, drained the last of his Bourbon, and snapped his fingers. Her booty still swishing and shimmying like the balls of a mahogany executive desk toy, the Notary rose to her killer-heeled feet and set about refilling Numesy&#39;s glass, removing the used ice and giving him some fresh. When she turned around, he was entirely naked, his scepter of Ares standing proud and free, and she was as lost to it as any female would be in such a situation. She almost didn&#39;t realise she&#39;d fallen to her knees in preparation for him, but the silly girl had quite forgotten she&#39;d put her gas-mask on, and Numesy was obliged to discipline her with the back of his hand. Thus chastened, she turned again, presenting him with her womanly entrance, and as he unzipped her to get at her prize, she noticed the door was still open.<br><br>And then he began to make hard, strong, manly love to her, and she didn&#39;t notice anything for several hours thereafter.</p>

            <p>It was really nice of Desdendelle to invite her over for tea, the Aviator thought as she walked down the Generic Grey corridors of HQ. The Floater really did make the best tea, she wasn&#39;t exaggerating when she said that. For some strange reason, Zeb had declined to come along. Oh, well. More for her. <br><br>Hopefully the Librarian wouldn&#39;t be there, the smug bastard. The Aviator’s face felt hot just thinking about him. Authors above, but he made her so angry all the time, it was a wonder she hadn&#39;t punched him more than she had.<br><br>She arrived outside RC log10e and went in without knocking, like Des had said. She stopped short when she saw the Librarian sitting at the table— alone. She did a quick sniff to be sure, but it was already fairly obvious Desdendelle wasn&#39;t there.<br><br>The Librarian looked from his tablet up at her entrance, raising an eyebrow.<br><br>&quot;Oh, I suppose you think this is funny?&quot; the Aviator snapped. &quot;You sent me the message, didn&#39;t you? Well, ha ha, very funny. What, did you want to tell me how much of a stupid ape I was for falling for your trick?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I did not send any message,&quot; the Librarian replied, standing up in an attempt to seem more authoritative. Though the Time Lord wasn&#39;t quite as tall as the Lady, he still radiated his centuries of experience. And haughtiness, but that goes without saying. &quot;My partner left not several minutes ago, saying he was going to your response center for tea.&quot;<br><br>The Aviator and the Librarian stared at each other for a while. &quot;Our partners set us up,&quot; the Aviator finally said, feeling her face heat up. &quot;Guess you get out of being punched for now.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Your primitive, violent tendencies once again show your immaturity,&quot; the Librarian said cooly. &quot;It&#39;s no wonder you joined the DMS. Anywhere else would not have been able to hold your attention. I wouldn&#39;t expect any less from a <i>human.</i>&quot;<br><br>&quot;You—!&quot; The Aviator strode over and made to jab a finger against the Librarian&#39;s chest, but he caught her by the wrists. She tore herself free. &quot;You&#39;re an asshole,&quot; she spat, feeling her hearts beating faster. What was the deal with this Time Lord?<br><br>Unbeknownst to the Aviator, the Librarian was having a similar reaction. This girl never ceased to get on his nerves. She was immature, intellectually inferior, and, he felt it was important to remember, not a real Time Lady. And yet there was something about her that drew him to her, something he might not have noticed had it not been for his partner&#39;s silly mocking. Maybe it was her willingness to stand up to him, something not many people bothered to do. Maybe it was the memory of the first time he&#39;d seen her, vulnerable and scared and searching for answers, and how vastly different that was from the real her. Maybe it was seeing just how much she had changed since then, how strong she’d become.<br><br>For a moment, his emotions got the better of him, and he let a brief feeling of attraction pass from him to her.<br><br>The Aviator suddenly froze, her face flushing when she felt the Librarian&#39;s emotions. Was she just imagining things, caught up in the moment as she was? But no, the feeling was definitely there. Before she realized what was happening, she was leaning in, and the Librarian was doing the same, and suddenly their lips had met. <br><br>It lasted barely a second, but when they pulled back, both their faces were red. <br><br>&quot;Um,&quot; the Aviator said, feeling like her brain had short-circuited.<br><br>The Librarian moved his hands from her wrists to around her waist. &quot;So eloquent,&quot; he murmured, raising an eyebrow. &quot;Tell me, have you always been so good with words, or is that a regeneration-specific trait?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Oh, shut up,&quot; the Aviator said, and leaned in again.<br><br>Their second kiss lasted much longer than the first, and both Time Lords were pressed so close together they could feel the pounding of each others’ hearts. When they came up for air, the Librarian leaned his forehead against the Aviator’s, sending her the memory of the first time she’d punched him.<br><br>“You deserved that, you know,” the Aviator murmured.<br><br>“I did,” the Librarian agreed, leaning away slightly so he could look her in the eye. “But that’s not important. It was right after that when my oh so subtle partner began his teasing. Do you remember?”<br><br>“Of course I do,” the Aviator said, only a little annoyed. “Perfect recall. Do you remember?”<br><br>The Librarian raised a delicate eyebrow at her. “Are you going to shut up on your own or do I need to do that for you?”<br><br>“How about you answer some questions instead?” the Aviator said, pulling away and sitting at the table. “Like why you’ve always been so hostile to me if this is how you really feel?”<br><br>The Librarian sat as well, interlacing his fingers. “Simple. Because you are not a real Time Lady.”<br><br>“Again, not really something I had any control over,” the Aviator reminded him. Her irritation was so great the Librarian could feel it, and he winced.<br><br>“To be fair, I am not entirely sure why I have indulged in such follies as…”<br><br>“Snogging?” the Aviator suggested, raising her own eyebrow. “If it makes you feel any better, you were pretty damn good at it.”<br><br>“Why, thank you. I’m sure our partners would be delighted to hear that.” The Librarian sighed. “I will not sugarcoat things. Quite frankly, I have not the slightest idea why I seem to find you attractive. You are not learned, you are immature, and you certainly have an inflated sense of self-worth.”<br><br>“Look who’s talking,” the Aviator said, scowling at him. <br><br>The Librarian held up a hand. “Allow me to finish,” he said. “Despite this, your dedication to and adeptness at your job are certainly admirable, and I have grown to respect you in the course of our time working together. If you had been born a Time Lady, I am certain you would have been on par with, if not above, most of your peers.”<br><br>“Gosh, thanks.” The Aviator peered at the Librarian. “How old <i>are</i> you, anyway? Like, exactly.”<br><br>The Librarian shrugged. “About three centuries. I am not very old by Time Lord standards. The age difference is negligible when you take into account our life spans.”<br><br>The Aviator smiled. “I’m not so sure my parents would see it that way, but alright. They’ll be all, ‘couldn’t you have gone for someone who <i>isn’t</i> an entire century younger than you?’”<br><br>The Librarian, whose hand had been inching across the table towards the Aviator’s, froze. “Parents?” he nearly stammered.<br><br>“Oh, right, you were Loomed, weren’t you?” the Aviator said, deliberately misunderstanding his cause for hesitation. “Well, you see, when a mummy and a daddy love each other very much—”<br><br>“I am well aware of how sexual reproduction works,” the Librarian snapped.<br><br>Both Time Lords blushed suddenly.<br><br>“Well, I don’t know about going that far,” the Aviator said, taking the Librarian’s hand and grinning mischievously, “but would you like to take this to the couch?”<br><br>She’d barely finished speaking before the Librarian’s mouth was on hers.<br><br><u>Meanwhile, back in RC 3-Apple-14…</u><br><br>“So,” Des said, pouring a cup of tea for himself and a bowl for Zeb and sitting down in the armchair, “how long do you think it’ll take for them to realize they’ve been tricked?”<br><br>“Oh, not long at all,” Zeb said, lapping at his tea. “The real question is, what will they do when they realize it?”<br><br>“Probably do unspeakable things to us,” Des said cheerfully. He sipped his tea and sighed contentedly. “I bet Arinaviator punches Librarian again, how much do you want to bet?”<br><br>“I’m not taking you up on that,” Zeb said, laughing so hard he nearly upset his bowl. “Say, want to watch something while we wait for them to hunt us down?”<br><br>But as Des and Zeb waited, neither of their partners came bursting into the response center, demanding to know what the big idea was. After an hour had passed, they began to get worried.<br><br>“You don’t think they’ve killed each other?” Zeb said, his ears flicking in agitation.<br><br>“Or at the very least tried to.” Des stroked his goatee thoughtfully. “Or perhaps they— nah, they wouldn’t…”<br><br>“Wouldn’t what?” Zeb asked, fairly certain he knew what Des was talking about but wanting confirmation.<br><br>“Never you mind. What say you we go back to my RC to make sure nothing’s happened that requires a trip to Medical?” Without waiting for Zeb, Des got up and hurried to the door. Zeb followed at his heels.<br><br>When they opened the door to RC log10e, both their mouths fell open.<br><br>The Aviator’s and the Librarian’s coats had been carelessly tossed on the floor, and the Time Lords in question were on the couch— or, rather, the Aviator was on the couch. The Librarian was more on the Aviator. His hands were tangled in her hair, and they were kissing with a passion that made Des and Zeb feel very uncomfortable. Neither of them had been expecting an outcome like this.<br><br>“Is this a bad time?” Des said lightly.<br><br>The Librarian leapt up as though stung. “You— what are you—?” he stuttered, for once lost for words as he fumbled to re-button his shirt, which was nearly hanging off his shoulders. His normally-tidy hair was mussed and there was a pink tinge to his face. “You said you would be gone for tea!”<br><br>“That was an hour ago,” Des said, averting his eyes from a very red-faced Aviator when she sat up to reveal she was wearing a tank top that only barely qualified as decent, showing off her nice figure.  “Don’t tell me you two were—?”<br><br>“That is absolutely none of your business,” the Librarian said, doing up the last button and grabbing his longcoat off the floor. Without a second look at the Aviator, he strode into the RC’s other room and slammed the door shut behind him.<br><br>Des turned his head to the Aviator, though he still kept his gaze away. “<i>Explain?</i>”<br><br>“Not really sure I can,” the Aviator said, still blushing furiously as she grabbed her discarded shirt from the back of the sofa and shrugged it on. “One minute we were insulting each other, and the next—” She shrugged, grinned, and would have blushed even harder if that were possible.<br><br>“So, you and him, huh?” Zeb said, shaking his head. “Well, it’s about time!”<br><br>The Aviator’s fingers slipped as she was doing up her shirt. “You—?”<br><br>Zeb nodded. “Seriously, it was so obvious you two liked each other, even I could see it, and I’m not very good at spotting that sort of thing.”<br><br>“I thought it would take longer than this, honestly,” Des said, breathing a small sigh of relief when the Aviator was finally covered. “Mind you, now Librarian’s going to make life miserable for interrupting his… fun.”<br><br>“I’ll see if I can’t get him to take it easy on you,” the Aviator said, retrieving her own coat and pulling it on. “He’s really not that bad once you get to know him.”<br><br>“I’m so sure,” Des said dryly. “When you say ‘not that bad’, you mean ‘not that bad a kisser’, I suppose? Because he’s still an asshole.”<br><br>The Aviator lobbed a ball of lint at his head. “Shut it, you,” she said, but she was smiling.<br></p>

R&amp;R ;D<br><br>The Librarian was restlessly. The Aviator and the reader were asleep after a wild sex session, but he was restlessly. He wanted more.<br><br>He wanted it all.<br><br>The Aviator nuzzle closer to him and he stroked her red hair (AN: I now Aviator is black-haired but this way it’s better so I changed it). She rapped one hand around his waste, her fingers cool against his heated skin. This act enflamed his desires and he ran a hand on the Aviator’s curvy curves.<br><br>This wake Reader up. “Hey dont egnore me” she said, pressing her curvier curves on his back.<br><br>“Like anyone could egnore you”, the Aviator said and leaned over the Librarian to kiss her deep. Wow the reader was so beautiful and sexxy and perfect she could loose herself in her eyes.<br><br>Thogh the Aviator was allso beautiful and sexy an perfect plus she had really long hair which was also verry nice ;)<br><br>But everyone knew teh Reader was the hottest because everyone wanted her but she only wanted the librarian and the aviator and maybe some other people ;)) but mostly the timelords because everone knows timelords a<br><br>The Reader kissed her back really well and pressed against the Librarian really close. He huged them bath. “Ur both so sex” he sed. though thinking he liked the Aviator more becaue her curves were nicer and her hair was also very nice it shimmered like fire.<br><br>“I know” The Aviator said smiling mischivosly. The Reader smiled with a really pretty smile and missed her again because she knew the Librarian loved too watch them kos because our was really hot<br><br>The Aviator got up and pinned the Reader to the bed. “Your pretty hot too” she said and traled kisses everywhere. Teh Reader gasped and titled her head with her curly hair that was not in a bun this time because she was in bed<br><br>Suddenly they were all covered on hot chocolate! Librarina’s partner, the EVIL DES, has did so so they wouldnt be able to have sax!<br><br>“MUWHAHAHAHAHA!!!111!!!1!” lafed DES “now you cant hev sax forever@”<br><br>The Aviator just giggled and licked it off purring like a sexy cat. teh Reader helped her and then they locked some of it off the Reader because she wanted it and then they both turned to the Librarian and pounced on him who was watching them lick thechocolate off both of them at once and stated to luck the chocolate that was on him too so they could foil the EVIL DES forever<br><br>Then the Reader pushed the avuator off her and grabbed the Librarian kissing him ferocosly like a tiger in heat. The Aiator joined in pasionatly.<br><br>She wanted the Reader sooo much it made her insides cry and <br><br>There was lots of rolling around and then some tickling happened and then some whips were got and the Linrarian was punished for being a very naghty boy. He was also whupped by the aViator’s hair which was like fire (lol in more way than one!)<br><br>But then! DES APPEARED! And he took all the whupes away! “SNOW YOU CANT HAVE XAX” HE SAID<br><br>“Shows what you know.” Said the Reader. “All we need is or bodies but you can&#39;t take my Grey tie because it&#39;s my turn to be Christian grey now come here&#39; and she tied the EVIL DES to the bed &quot; okay &quot; she said to the aviator &quot;now we make him see how good we are together&quot; and she missed the aviator to start showing him and the librarian was watching,<br><br>The Reader and tHe aviator lie on the bed kissing eachother all over the place because they were Timeladies in love and everyone knows Timeladies ate the most paissonate of lovers when they get started in frenzy!!! Like tigers in heat!!!!!<br><br>And also the EVIL DES was only trying to stop them because he has been JEALOUS THE WHILE TIME because teh librarian for to be with two timeladies but he only had a human and now he was a cyborg but timelords can fix that because otherwise it would be to weird<br><br>And then they had exteremyl good sex while des watched cuz he wasstill tied to the bed the end.<br><br>***<br><br>The Aviator was silent for a long moment. “What the hell?” she finally said. “I don’t have any firsthand experience, but I’m <i>pretty sure it isn’t supposed to work like that!</i>”<br><br>“The bad spelling generally isn’t part of it, yes,” the Reader agreed. She had looked nauseated at various points during her reading, but was now suppressing laughter.<br><br>The Aviator eyeballed her. “Are you laughing at me?” <br><br>“At the nonsense, mostly,” the Reader said soothingly. “It’s too ridiculous to rage at, past a certain point.”<br><br>“Wait, I’m evil now?” Des sounded more confused than anything else.<br><br>“Hey, at least you’re not screwing the Librarian and the kid you practically <i>raised</i>,” the Aviator said, jabbing a finger at him.<br><br>“This is preposterous!” the Librarian roared. “To think I would even touch that faker! Let alone… do that!”<br><br>“So you would touch me?” the Reader asked quietly. She sounded amused.<br><br>The Librarian just stared at her. She patted his shoulder, biting back a grin.<br><br>“Um, Lump, both of them are right here beside you,” Des informed his partner. <br><br>To emphasize his point, the Aviator punched the Librarian’s shoulder. “I feel obligated to point out my second body was very definitely not curvy,” she said, much calmer now. She looked down at herself. “...Kind of makes me wonder why they decided to go for that one.”<br><br>“I reckon it’s because of the Godiva hair.” Des shrugged. “What’s bothering me, though, is that they got the evil laugh <i>completely</i> wrong. Not to mention, I’m evil now?”<br><br>The Reader shrugged. “I think we redeemed you at the end or something,” she said.<br><br>“But I don’t <i>need</i> redeeming!” Des complained. “I’m fine as I am now!”<br><br>“Yes, but you were evil in the nonsense,” the Reader said helpfully. “So we redeemed you.”<br><br>“You know what does need redeeming?” the Aviator said, standing up and reaching for her staser. “This fic. I say we kill it. With fire, if at all possible. And possibly spoons.”<br><br>The Reader shrugged. “Why not. It’d solve the question of where am I going to find chocolate that works like that, at least…”<br></p>

            <p>((OOC: Everything in the author&#39;s note except for half of the last sentence is true.))<br>AN: Hello, all! So, back in the dark days of high school, I read two pretty good stories with a similar &quot;half-human hybrid kids get in trouble and/or go on adventures&quot; deal: James Patterson&#39;s Maximum Ride books <strike>(Angel OP, plz nerf)</strike> and antialiasis&#39; very awesome and equally dark <a href="http://dragonflycave.com/fanfiction.aspx">Morphic</a>. (It&#39;s the second entry under &quot;chaptered&quot;.) Morphic in particular inspired me to create twelve different human-Pokémon hybrid characters. The story I originally wanted to write for them--a mildly epic child-soldier drama set on the Sevii Islands--never got past two different versions of chapter one, so I&#39;ve farmed them out to various branches of the PPC! Hopefully this works better for them than the other thing. Enjoy and please review!<br><br>Chapter One: Kylie and James<br>Somewhere in Medical...<br><br>Nurse-in-training Kylie handed a scalpel and a set of plastic gloves to Nurse Marian McKay. &quot;You were looking for these, right?&quot; she asked.<br><br>&quot;These&#39;ll do. Thanks, newbie,&quot; said Marian, setting the scalpel down to put the gloves on. &quot;Have you finished organizing the World One pain medications yet?&quot;<br><br>Kylie scratched the back of her neck. &quot;James is taking care of that...I think.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Go check,&quot; Marian ordered. She picked up the scalpel and marched off toward whoever had gotten him/her/their/xirself badly wounded this time.<br><br>Kylie shrugged sadly and headed back the way she&#39;d come. When she got to the storage room, she saw James chatting with a blonde and brown-eyed nurse.<br><br>&quot;...And check <i>this</i> out,&quot; he said. He raised his arms in front of him in an X. The sharp leaves sticking out of his wrists began to glow green, then merged into a longer one. &quot;Leaf Blade!&quot; He ran forward a few steps and sliced the air samurai-style. &quot;Oh, hey, Kylie. Nurse Lillian here wanted to see what all we can do.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I don&#39;t think we&#39;ve ever had human-Pokémon hybrids working here,&quot; said Lillian. &quot;Are you all reforming Sues and Stus?&quot; <br><br>&quot;Uh...no, ma&#39;am,&quot; said Kylie nervously. &quot;At least, I hope we&#39;re not. To be honest, I barely remember any of my former life at all.&quot; She felt her back warming up. <i>Calm down; she&#39;s not a scientist, not really</i> she told herself. <i>You&#39;re safe now. No one&#39;s going to make you fight or run mazes.</i><br><br>James stood up and made an annoyed sound. &quot;We&#39;re semi-fic blips with half an edgy backstory each. We may be screwed up, but we&#39;re not <i>that</i>screwed up.&quot;<br><br>&quot;No, I suppose not,&quot; Lillian admitted. &quot;I&#39;ll be sure to arrange full examinations for all twelve of you. My specialties are really Wraiths and Middle-Earth species, but I&#39;ve never examined a Pokémon-verse agent before. I can&#39;t pass up this scientific opportunity! I heard one girl can see the future, is that true?&quot;<br><br>Kylie&#39;s back got warmer. &quot;Yes, ma&#39;am, that&#39;d be Cassie.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Short for Cassandra. Of course.&quot; Lillian rolled her eyes. &quot;Well, you two have a job that needs doing, yes? Then do it. I&#39;ll see you around!&quot;<br><br>James frowned as she retreated. &quot;I don&#39;t think I trust her. I don&#39;t want her poking around with us.&quot;<br><br>&quot;She&#39;s a doctor, we&#39;ll be fine,&quot; said Kylie.<br><br>&quot;So were the whack-jobs who created us, and look how that turned out. ...Wait. Bad example.&quot;<br><br>Kylie undid and redid her cornflower-blue ponytail. &quot;Please, let&#39;s just finish working, all right? The sooner we get done, the sooner we can go find Neil or Cassie or Aria. I wonder how they&#39;re all doing?&quot;</p>

            <p>Title: Suicide Boys<br>Rating: SUPER HOT LEMON!!<br>Summary: Supernumerary is asked to make up with Suicide, but things don&#39;t go according to his plan.  If you want to know what happens next, read the fic! WARNING: SLASH!!! ^.-<br>--------------------------------------------------------------<br>A/N: This is set after <i>Ring Child</i>.  Nume and Su have so much tension in that mission, I just had to give them a chance to let it out!<br><br>Supernumerary stood outside the doorway of Suicide&#39;s RC, his heart in his stomach.  He was very angry at Jenny for making him apologize to Suicide.  The man was everything he despised, wrapped up in one contemptible package, and having to kowtow before him was nothing short of shameful.  He knocked on the door, crossing his fingers that the Scythian would be otherwise occupied, and he could put this off for another day.<br><br>Much to his disappointment, the door opened, revealing none other than Suicide himself.  Nume&#39;s heart jumped dramatically from his stomach to his throat, as he felt his face burn read.  The older man was wearing nothing more than a pair of shorts, and his long, silken silver hair was tousled, as if he had only woken up recently.  Even the numerous scars did little to mar his comely visage.<br><br>This was the true reason that Nume hated him.  As contemptible as the contents might be, he had to admit that the packaging was very attractive indeed.<br><br>Nume averted his face in a vain attempt to hide the blush he could feel spreading across his face.  &quot;Jenny wanted to talk to you about what happened on that last mission.  Said it would be good for us to work out all our <i>feelings</i>.&quot;  He spat out the last word with all the disgust he could muster - a significant amount indeed, given the source and subject matter.<br><br>Suicide shrugged casually, and stood away from the door, beckoning the other man in.  &quot;I can do talking, if that&#39;s what you want.  But I doubt your fist could handle another fight.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Idiot,&quot; Nume muttered<br><br>Then they had sex, and it was very sexy.</p>

            <p>And that&#39;s saying a lot. I mean, I get the &quot;I hate your guts but damn it you&#39;re hot&quot; thing, but...you jumped from that to them having sex way too quickly. I think this might have been better as a multi-chaptered fic gradually showing the progression from Nume hating Suicide to maybe hating him a little less to the start of their relationship. You don&#39;t really need to call it a &quot;SUPER HOT LEMON&quot; if you censor the only sex scene, either. (Also, isn&#39;t Suicide already involved with Nurse Robinson?)</p>

            <p>So Iwrote this back when Ifirst heard that these two had gotten together and first i didn&#39;t really like it but then it turns out they&#39;re adorable and fluffy and stuff and so Ithought i&#39;d write something where they&#39;re happy!! and then i thought what if they met but it was different and this happened!! so i wrote this and Ireally hope you like it rnr kisses!! :D DW**<br><br>%^&amp;(*<br><br>Agent Des was walking down the hallway in HQ when Agent Dawn bounced up to him.<br><br>&quot;Ihave a flamethrower,&quot; she proclaimed, brandishing it and grinning.<br><br>Agent Des smild back. &quot;You do. Isee it.&quot;He paused. &quot;Didn&#39;t you already have one?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Nope!&quot;Dawn&#39;s grin grew. &quot;First one! But it&#39;s awesome and Ilove it and T&#39;Zar says that as long as Ifollow the rules, Ican keep it, and it&#39;ll be mine and everything&#39;s awesome!&quot;<br><br>&quot;That&#39;s great,&quot;said Des. &quot;Er--&quot;<br><br>&quot;It is,&quot;agreed Dawn. Her blue-green eyes sparkled. &quot;It&#39;s fantastic. I&#39;m going to go show everyone in HQ now, bye!&quot; And before Des could say anything, she bounced away, going &quot;Don&#39;t think of people...don&#39;t think of people...&quot;<br><br>Seconds later, she turned around and came back.<br><br>&quot;Yes?&quot;said Des. He was smiling at her even though he was confused, because she hadn&#39;t even hugged him. Although maybe that was because of the flamethrower. but he was still confused, because he and Agent Dawn were dating.<br><br>&quot;Do you have a flamethrower?&quot; asked Agent Dawn. Her eyes were wide and her hair was in a long braid that seemed shorter than Agent Des remembered. She was very pretty!!<br><br>&quot;No,&quot;said Agent Des, &quot;I don&#39;t.&quot; He smiled at her. His smile was also pretty! But not as pretty as Dawn&#39;s hair<br><br>&quot;Aw,&quot;Dawn said. She grinned at him. &quot;You should totally get one! Because flamethrowers are awesome.&quot; And then she left and Des was still confused.<br>But he let Dawn go because he had a mission that the Librarian told him about, and because Dawn was obviously busy but she would totally tell him what it was all about later!<br><br>So then later he saw agent Dawn and she said to him &quot;Oh hi Des, Ihaven&#39;t seen you all day!&quot;<br><br>And Des said, &quot;but you saw me earlier and you had a flamethrower&quot;and then Dawn remembered that once when she was eighteen and in the DOGA she had run around HQ qith her new flamethrower that she was really excited about and she had accidentally time-traveled to the future and met Agent Des without knowing who he was! And so then they hugged and everything was good and eighteen year old Dawn got safely to her present but then back in timeto talk to Agent Dfydd because she likes Elves and Davydd is an Elf and realy cool.<br><br>THE END!!<br><br>**<br><br>Dawn McKenna stared at her screen. &quot;...wow.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Wow?&quot; Jacques Bonnefoy leaned over her shoulder, and then started to laugh. &quot;Well, that writer&#39;s got you pegged.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I know,&quot; Dawn said. &quot;And it&#39;s creepy. I mean, that&#39;s pretty much exactly eighteen-year-old me, right down to running around showing my new flamethrower to random people. And Des isn&#39;t too far off, for most of it. If there wasn&#39;t this weird lack of spaces, and it didn&#39;t go sloppy at the end...and if it was tightened up a bit...it might actually be good. A bit random, but good. How&#39;d she manage it?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Luck?&quot; suggested the former Jack Harkness character replacement. He dragged over a chair and sat down. &quot;A writing class?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Hm, maybe.&quot; Dawn reached up to pet the gold fire-lizard perched on her shoulder; the gold crooned. &quot;Maybe just coincidence. At least it&#39;s not scarring.&quot;<br><br>&quot;There is that,&quot; agreed Jacques. He offered his hand to the fire-lizard; she sniffed it, and then butted it with her head. &quot;How&#39;d you get this, anyway? You&#39;re not going into it for a mission, are you?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Nah.&quot; Dawn shut off the screen and turned to grin at him. &quot;I was just curious. We&#39;ve got that shield, see.&quot;<br><br>&quot;That&#39;s good,&quot; Jacques said. He grinned back. &quot;So,&quot; he said, drawing out the word suggestively. &quot;I hear Agent Des has a pretty smile.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Oh, don&#39;t start,&quot; Dawn scoffed. After a moment she added, &quot;And he does, yeah.&quot;<br><br>Jacques chuckled. &quot;Although I hear your hair is prettier. Now, I&#39;ve never thought of holding a beauty contest where one person&#39;s smile is judged by another person&#39;s hair, but--&quot;<br><br>Dawn groaned. &quot;Does this end in a story of some sort?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Maybe.&quot;<br><br>&quot;...does it involve French?&quot;<br><br>Jacques considered this. &quot;Yes,&quot; he said at last. &quot;Wait, no. That&#39;s the time with the--well, nevermind,&quot; he added. &quot;No, this one doesn&#39;t involve French.&quot;<br><br>Dawn waved a hand. &quot;Carry on, then.&quot;<br><br>Jacques leaned back, grinned, and began to tell his story.<br><br>---<br>((This was such fun to write--both the twaddle above and the reaction shot. Agent Des will, likely, never meet Pyro!Dawn, but it came to mind this evening along with &#39;what if the real Dawn saw it&#39; (she&#39;s got a history of seeing the badfic, with the Game of Romes reaction shot last year) &#39;and was creeped out or something&#39;. And so then I sat down and wrote it, and Jacques made his way in, and just...it was a nice warm-up for part 3 of 50 Shades of Tacitus, I&#39;ll say that. Twaddle ahoy! ~DF</p>

            <p>Once upon the time, there was a cat who lived in HQ. It was a nice cat with soft black fur and gentle green eyees, and one day someone decided they wanted to have a baby, but they could&#39;nt.<br><br>&quot;I know,&quot; they said &quot;I will make the cat my baby,&quot;<br><br>So they took the cat and used the disguise Generator to turn it into a elf baby and raised it as their baby and the baby was named Dafydd and he was an elf.<br><br>Dafydd went on to be very famos by killing lots of Mary Sues but then one day after his three thousand birthday his mom came up to him and said &quot;Dafidd theres something I need to tell you.&quot; &quot;What&#39;s that&quot;? he asked, &quot;Well she said &quot;Your really a cat.:<br><br>And so she reversed the disguise and Dafydd turned back into a cat!!!<br><br>&quot;NOOO!&quot; Cried Constance who was in the middle of tending to her and Dafidd&#39;s children which for some unexplained reason until now had turned out to be kittens.<br><br>THE END.</p>

            <p>It has come to my attention that most writers are portraying Middle-earth in far too positive a light, as if its inhabitants actually had enough brain cells to realize that, hey, women are people too! So I&#39;m writing to counteract that, and all of the stupid Sues out there. Hate those things. <br><br>**********************************(((((((((((((((((((((((((((())))))))))))))))))))))))))********************************************<br><br>Alexia Ravenscroft hated her looks: she was far too pretty, and that was dangerous in Middle-earth. In these lands, beauty was weakness. The oppressive patriarchy that permeated the world from east to west brokered no femininity not in subjection to men. That made Alexia Ravesncroft a target. <br><br>So when the opportunity came to join the Fellowship under the guise of a man, she took it gladly and with a grim laugh. &quot;Who shall care if I die?&quot; she had asked her abusive stepfather, Elrond. &quot;Not I! Nor you, old fool!&quot; Then Elrond had slapped her; such was Middle-earth. <br><br>Now she was travelling with the Fellowship, or, as she called it, the Patriarchy Personified. There was the Old Patriarch, Gandalf; the Arch Patriarch, Aragorn; the Beta Patriarch, Boromir; and all of the rest were Sub-Patriarchs. None of them would even <i>look</i> at her if they guessed she was female;  cursed misogynists. But such was Middle-earth. <br><br>During the day she stayed silent and at night she had to listen to them grilling meat and talking around their campfire about how stupid and silly and horrible women were. All the while she burned with anger and the knowledge that if she could just use her Powers, she could wipe them all out. <br><br>Worst of all were thoughts of her stepsister, <i>Arwen.</i> Arwen was the pretty perfect princess of Middle-earth-- she represented what women were to the patriarchy. Pretty, pretty stupid, and worthless for anything other than her looks. Elrond loved her (said he loved her, more like) and was always telling Alekia that she &quot;should be more like Arwen&quot; or &quot;why <i>can&#39;t</i> you be more like Arwen?&quot; or &quot;you could learn from Arwen.&quot;<br><br>All in all, Alexia had a horrid life, and it was all because of the patriarchy. <br><br>********************************((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((()))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))**************************<br><br>Reviews, people! Just plain good writing doesn&#39;t keep the lights on! :P </p>

            <p>The time had come for Agent Super Badass McGee to ascend to the throne of the PPC. The treacherous Sunflower Official had been slain by the faithful, Hetero and awesome lords of righteousness for propogating falsehoods. <br><br>McGee smirked grimly and a look came to his blue-green eyes.as he drew his Mateba Auto-revolver with the chrome finish and customized to have an extra shot from his long black trenchcoat. The gun was called &quot;Samantha&quot; and was engraved &quot;To My Son: Makes-Things.&quot; Makes-things was still good and straight, Mcgee thought to himself as a grim smile came to his lips. But there was still work to do. The whiteness and heteroness of the PPC was still in jeopardy. Women were still thinking and not doing their jobs, which was obeying the superior male agents in every way possible.<br><br>He made his way to the office, killing any evil agent of the PPC that he came into contact with. &quot;Show&#39;s over, wuss.&quot; he laughed as he went into the office of the Sunflower Official who was totally on the phone with Obama (Show us the birth certificate, Commie!) and they were totally plotting to stop America from being the straight, white, male-centered home it really was. <br><br>&quot;You can&#39;t stop us from making the world weak!&quot; the Sunflower Official smirked from where he was on the phone and Obama laughed wickedly. <br><br>&quot;Yez. Zoon ve shall have all &#39;merica and the world suffering under the heel of the French COwards und russin monsters. Hahahaha.&quot; He laughed evilly. <br><br>McBadass laughed as well, and my eyes were blue-green and gimlet as he took aim with his revolver. &quot;After I kill this commie coward, you&#39;re next, fool!&quot; he shouted defiantly at the Viewscreen<br><br>Osama (Hah! See what I did there?) shrieked in fear and shut off the screen, having totally messed his pants in fear of Badass McGee&#39;s American Maleness. <br><br>The SO cleared his throat and drew his own gun, which wasn&#39;t really a gun but a fake, flimsy-looking Popgun &#39;cause he didn&#39;t believe that guns were awesome (What a coward!) &quot;You will die!&quot; He shouted as he pulled the trigger and the only thing that came out was a flag saying &quot;Biden!&quot;<br><br>McGee laughed and fired his awesome revolver into the Sunflower Official&#39;s face. As the flower exploded into a field of blood and gore, spraying the entiire offie with his cowardly guts, McGee went over to his chair, which was big and black and plush. He sat down in it and said to the entire PPC: &quot;I&#39;m in charge now.&quot;<br><br>And the PPC cheered because they knew that their rightful king had taken charge. </p>

            <p>The time had come for Super Badass McGee and his awesome army of men (The women were all crying in the desks after McGee took over &#39;cause that&#39;s what they do. If they didn&#39;t, they wouldn&#39;t be all into Slash and Yaoi and stuff.) Stormed the white house as easily as if they had crushed tiny bug. The stupid cowards who gave up their guns<br><br>Obamas weak, losers of a Secret Service were no match for their awesomenss and kung-fu moves taught to them by their Secret Sensai, (who was totally this white guy who looked like Ted Nugent and Chuck Norris combined and knew all types of kung fu and, unbenownst to them was actually Badass McGee&#39;s BROTHER!) - they were tossed aside like stupid puppies.<br><br>&quot;We have them on the run, sir!&quot; McGee&#39;s faithful partner, Dark Cloud said triumphantly as he executed the cowardly biden who had fallen to his knees upon seeing their awesome PPC army. <br><br>McGee adjusted his fedora...actually, it wasn&#39;t a fedora it was one of those old cowboy hats like my dad wears, a Statson, and smirked grimly as he pulled out Samantha, his gold-plated engraved M1911 with an extra bullet and a compensator..actually, it was like Snake&#39;s gun from Metal Gear. <br><br>&quot;Time to kick some ass.&quot; He said as he kicked open the door of the Oval Office. Obama was there hiding under his desk like the coward he was, &#39;ause he was french. And he was with his boyfriend Putin (who is actually okay cause he hates the gayness but hes also russian. So he&#39;s a commie jerk.) <br><br>&quot;Fo&#39; Shizzle, badass Honky! You can&#39;t stop me! I&#39;m obama, MothaF***cka!&quot; (I&#39;m censoring it &#39;cause the rules of this stupid board are dumb. Don&#39;t censor me!)  <br><br>&quot;Time for both of you to die horribly, cowards! Ted Nugent forever!&quot; McGee shouted as he shot them both in their faces. Their heads exploded, showering the room with gore and guts but not brains! (For obvious reasons.)<br><br>He sat down on the Oval Office&#39;s chair, looking reverentally at the Bald Eagle that was above it and nodded. America was finally safe...for the most part. No more bad fanfics were going to be written because Women knew their place and finally, a True White Christian Man was running the country. He rubbed his beard as he thought - &quot;Now to free the world!&quot; <br><br>TO BE CONTINUED. <br><br>I know, I know, it&#39;s not cool to leave you guys on a cliffhanger like this, but leave good reviews or you&#39;re a coward! <br><br>(Incoherent. Racist. Right-wing. Sexist. Twelve. Hmmm...wat do next? Take on China? Have him team up with Master Chief to take on everyone who beats him on Xbox Live?)</p>

            <p>The Sunflower may be a total jerk, but I&#39;m pretty sure he doesn&#39;t have anything to do with Obama. Hell, there are so many US presidents in history and fiction he woudn&#39;t even have the time to phone them all and he would surely be able to find an even eviller one in some book or something.<br><br>Also, the Mateba. Why would any self-respecting True American hero use a non-American weapon? It&#39;s Italian. And leave the clip mods in Call of Duty, please. To add the extra round capacity to a revolver you would have to re-make the entire gun from scratch, and considering how finicky and unreliable the Mateba is it would be a success if it managed to fire once.<br><br>The sexism, too, is excessive.

            <p>You&#39;re not gonna win any fans here with that kind of language. I&#39;m especially concerned that you&#39;re using statements like &quot;Women were still thinking and not doing their jobs&quot; when I can reasonably infer, given that most writers around here identify as female, that you yourself are also a girl. But that might be my liberal bias in action. <br><br>Besides which, it&#39;s obvious you haven&#39;t given the Original Series more than a cursory glance. Please, please, for the love of whatever God you believe in, READ THE BLOODY SOURCE MATERIAL. THANK YOU AND GOODNIGHT.<br><br>The one point in your favor is that Agent McGee&#39;s design sounds like something a legit PPC writer would come up with. But then I caught the &quot;my&quot; and any plans I had of &quot;borrowing&quot; McGee&#39;s design went out the window. Sorry, bub, but I don&#39;t work with self-inserts. They give <i>real</i> OCs a bad name.<br><br>(Oh, and if you were thinking of challenging me to do better? Don&#39;t. I can, I will, and I&#39;ll write a queer female agent of color just to piss you off even more. Mwahahaha.)</p>

            <p>a/n So this is this new story about some of the DIA because the DIA is awesome, okay?? And it&#39;s gonna be good<br>so good<br>sooo goooooood<br>u&#39;ll love it<br>Okay, enjoy!! Remember to R&#39;nR!!<br><br>-------<br>I was staring into the mirror, trying to get my hair to lie flat. Why, you may ask? Because I, Gaspard de Grasse, have been pressed into service by my roommate.<br><br>Damn you, Guardsman.<br><br>Of all days, it&#39;s today that he chooses to have to lie on the couch with his injured body sprawled everywhere. Because of course he had to get impaled today--right when he was supposed to go interview Tacitus for the Multiverse Monitor. And no one else is available to do it--no one else except me.<br><br>I&#39;ve dressed as nicely as I can manage--clean jeans, a button-down shirt--but my black hair won&#39;t flatten no matter what I do. I try for a while longer, but finally I sigh and go out to the main room--no point delaying the inevitable.<br><br>The Guardsman lies on the couch, practically sprawling despite the stomach wound. His face is handsome, even with the pain; it figures. He&#39;s examining a deck of bloodsoaked cards when I enter.<br><br>&quot;Gaspard!&quot; he says once he&#39;s looked up. &quot;Thanks again for doing this.&quot;<br><br>I shrug. &quot;Yeah, well. How are you feeling?&quot;<br><br>His face crumples into a grimace; even then, he still looks nice. &quot;Well, you know. I&#39;ve got a watch stuck between my ribs--can feel it moving when I breathe--and I just found out my favorite deck of cards got ruined. They&#39;re just about shredded, see, and I doubt the blood will come out. Thanks for going to the interview, though, you&#39;re really saving me.&quot;<br><br>The Guardsman has to do this interview, because Tacitus is donating a lot of money to DoSAT, specifically for development of DIA tech. That&#39;s how he made his fortune--he&#39;s really good with tech. I don&#39;t know what else he does, though--I&#39;m not the one who got prepared for this interview. All I have is the Guardsman&#39;s cue cards; it&#39;ll have to be enough.<br><br>&quot;You just rest and get better,&quot; I tell him, and pick up my jacket from its hook by the door. &quot;I&#39;ll be back later. Is the Reader going to check up on you?&quot;<br><br>The Guardsman waves one strong hand. &quot;She&#39;ll text. Don&#39;t worry about me--just go. I&#39;ll be alright--dammit--&quot;<br><br>He&#39;s tried to sit up.<br><br>&quot;Don&#39;t regenerate,&quot; I tell him, and go out the door.<br><br>He&#39;ll be fine. And if he&#39;s not, his sister will scold his next regeneration, and then he&#39;ll apologize. It&#39;s happened once before.<br><br>With one last look back, I get into my car and drive away (a/n: it&#39;s a new thing I&#39;m adding that you have to use a car to get anywhere between departments--it just won&#39;t work as well otherwise, okay? On with the story!!). Away...towards Dives Enterprises Holdings, Inc.<br><br>--<br>((With no apologies to Sea-Turtle, except maybe several for the bits he didn&#39;t know about, and with full acknowledgement of general plot to E.L. James--parodic purposes only, here. Not that the badficcer here is ever going to admit the inspiration without being prompted heavily...))</p>

            <p>a/n Thanks for the review!!! I love reviews, everyone should leave a review so I can write faster!! Cookies to all my lovelies--u guys rock!!<br><br>On to the next bit! Remember to Rn&#39;R!!<br><br>so excited :D :D :D --we get to meet tacitus this time!! are you readyy~?<br>---------<br><br>I arrive at Dives Holdings Enterprises, Inc, and am immediately overwhelmed. I don&#39;t belong here--not Gaspard de Grasse with his crooked nose and casual clothes. The guy who greets me at the security desk is buff; he accepts that I&#39;m here instead of the Guardsman and sends me up to the seventh floor.<br><br>When I exit the elevator, I&#39;m immediately accosted by a lightly muscled blond young man with an all-American smile. His curly hair is neatly combed; he&#39;s wearing a suit.<br><br>&quot;You&#39;re here to see Mr. Tacitus, aren&#39;t you?&quot; he says, and ushers me to a seat. &quot;Here, sit down. May I take your coat?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Oh--uh--sure,&quot; I say awkwardly, and hand it over. He whisks it away: professional and efficient.<br><br><i>Everything you&#39;ll never be</i>, my Monologue says. He&#39;s looking at me with deep, dark eyes, black as tar. <i>You could never look like him. You could never even work like him. No wonder you&#39;ll never go anywhere.</i><br><br>&quot;Mr. Tacitus will be ready to see you soon,&quot; says a young woman. She&#39;s also blonde, nearly white-blonde, and she&#39;s dressed to the professional nines. &quot;He&#39;s just finishing up his current meeting. Alex!&quot;<br><br>The blond man from before jumps. &quot;Yes, Charlie?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Did you offer Mr. de Grasse anything to drink?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Oh--uh--no,&quot; Alex stammers. &quot;Uh--Mr. de Grasse, would you like coffee? Tea?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Water&#39;s fine,&quot; I say, and he rushes off to get it.<br><br>The blonde--Charlie--smiles at me. She&#39;s beautiful. &quot;Sorry about Alex, Mr. de Grasse--he&#39;s an intern here.&quot;<br><br>Alex returns with my water, which he hands over with his eyes lowered; I sip it, and try to ignore how my hands are shaking.<br><br><i>You&#39;ll mess it up, you know,</i> says the Monologue. He&#39;s sipping tea, perfectly sophisticated in a way that I&#39;m not. <i>You&#39;ll make a mess of it.</i><br><br>That doesn&#39;t mean I won&#39;t try, though, I think. I can&#39;t back out--I&#39;m here already, and the Guardsman is counting on me.<br><br>Of all times for him to get injured.<br><br>&quot;Mr. de Grasse?&quot; Charlie is back with her perfect smile and her long legs. &quot;Mr. Tacitus will see you now.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Oh--thank you,&quot; I say. I put the glass down and get to my feet, straightening my shirt. Slowly, I walk towards the door. Charlie&#39;s smile follows me, stays fixed in perfect, professional falseness.<br><br>Alex opens the door for me. I try to smile at him, and then take a deep breath and walk through.<br><br>I&#39;m completely focused on not making a fool of myself: just get through this interview, go home, give the Guardsman his notes. I can do this.<br><br>So, of course, the very first thing I do in Tacitus&#39; office...is trip.<br><br>-----<br><br>CLIFFIE!! So I may&#39;ve lied at the beginning--tacitus is going to be *next* chappie, not this one. Sorry!! It ust didn&#39;t work itn the end. But I promise he&#39;ll be in the next one, and then we an really get this story rolling!!<br><br>so I only got one wreview for the last chapter but thats okay, because I didn&#39;t post it that long ago. But I want more for this one!! Just remember--reviews are my fuel! You write more, I write more!! And special thanks to my friend Mrssupernumerary for reviewingg and leaving such a nice review for me!!<br><br>And reemmber--you can always leave me reviews even on chappies that aren&#39;t the latest one!! I love all the reviews I get. And you&#39;ll even still get cookies!~<br><br>See ya next time! Remember to tell me what you think!!<br><br>~DW~*</p>

            <p>a/n SO I&#39;M SO EXCITED THAT YOU&#39;RE LIKING THIS STORY<br>Anyway<br>So I&#39;m starting off with a flashback because I was in such a hurry to get up the last chapter that Iforgot a detail<br>but that&#39;s fine because a recap at the beginning of a chapter is very useful!!<br>So without further ado read on<br>and Ihope you like it<br>(PS: here&#39;s where we meet Tacitus!! Really, this time!! Aaaah!!!)<br><br>-------<br>Of all times for the Guardsman to get injured.<br><br>An elegantly dressed geth walks out of Tacitus&#39; office. Every bit of its armor is in perfect condition; I am obviously underdressed.<br><br>&quot;<font size="2"><font>Golf, this week, Tacitus,</font></font>&quot; it says firmly. I don&#39;t hear the reply. The geth nods at me as it passes, and Alex jumps out of his seat to go call the elevator.<br><br>It leaves.<br><br>&quot;Mr. de Grasse?&quot; Charlie is back with her perfect smile and her long legs. &quot;Mr. Tacitus will see you now.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Oh--thank you,&quot; I say. I put the glass down and get to my feet, straightening my shirt. Slowly, I walk towards the door. Charlie&#39;s smile follows me, stays fixed in perfect, professional falseness.<br><br>Alex opens the door for me. I try to smile at him, and then take a deep breath and walk through.<br><br>I&#39;m completely focused on not making a fool of myself: just get through this interview, go home, give the Guardsman his notes. I can do this.<br><br>So, of course, the very first thing I do in Tacitus&#39; office...is trip.<br><br>*<br><br><i>&quot;You utter klutz,&quot;</i> says my Monologue. He&#39;s utterly bored, and looking down at me where I&#39;ve landed on my hands and knees. <i>&quot;You can&#39;t even enter a room anymore. How...pitiful.&quot;</i><br><br>Gentle hands grasp my elbows and help me to stand. I can&#39;t bring myself to look up for a minute, but when I do--wow. Just wow. Red-tipped black hair and an intense look that makes me even more embarrassed--and he&#39;s young. He&#39;s so young.<br><br>He lets go of me and steps back. For a moment--I blink, thinking I&#39;m imagining it--but for a moment, he&#39;s some sort of grey and red fox as he leaps back to the desk. Suddenly, he&#39;s back to the beautiful young man who helped me up, and he grabs a pad of paper and a pen from the desk. He writes something and holds it out to me; I approach carefully and read the message.<br><br><i>That was quite a fall, Mr. Guardsman. Are you alright? Would you like to sit?</i><br><br>&quot;Oh, uh--I&#39;m alright,&quot; I say. Why can I never be smooth? I sound like I&#39;ve been hit in the head--dull and uninspired. &quot;And, actually, I&#39;m Gaspard. Gaspard de Grasse. The Guardsman&#39;s been injured, so I&#39;m here in his stead.&quot;<br><br><i>I&#39;m Tacitus Dives</i>, he writes back, and offers me his hand. I take it, and we shake; static electricity shocks me, and I pull away as casually as I can. It must be from my fall on the carpet.<br><br>We take our seats, and I set up the Guardsman&#39;s clunky-looking tape recorder. It doesn&#39;t run on tape, exactly--but he&#39;s upgraded it since the last time I asked. The on button seems to be in the same place, though.<br><br>&quot;I have some questions, Mr. Tacitus,&quot; I say once everything is in place.<br><br>He smirks, and writes, <i>I thought you might.</i><br><br>I find myself blushing red, and push my shoulders back to try to look less cowed. I raise the Guardsman&#39;s first cue card, and do my best to read his scribble--thankfully, most of these were typewritten. “You’re very young to have amassed such an empire. To what do you owe your success?” When I look up at him, he&#39;s disappointed but still smiling that wonderful smile.<br><br><i>Business is all about people, Mr. de Grasse, and I’m very good at judging people. I know how they tick, what makes them flourish, what doesn’t, what inspires them, and how to incentivize them. I employ an exceptional team, and I reward them well.</i> He stares at me, and then writes another set of sentences and hands them over. His handwriting is just this side of neat, spiky, dark, and precise. Nothing like my own boring letters. <i>My belief is to achieve success in any scheme one has to make oneself master of that scheme, know it inside and out, know every detail. I work hard, very hard to do that. I make decisions based on logic and facts. I have a natural gut instinct that can spot and nurture a good solid idea and good people. The bottom line is, it’s always down to good people.</i><br><br>“Maybe you’re just lucky,” I blurt out. He&#39;s arrogant. I don&#39;t usually like arrogant people.<br><br><i>I don’t subscribe to luck or chance, Mr. de Grasse.</i> he writes. <i>The harder I work the more luck I seem to have. It really is all about having the right people on your team and directing their<br>energies accordingly. I think it was Harvey Firestone who said ‘the growth and development of people is the highest calling of leadership.</i><br><br>“You sound like a control freak.” The words are out of my mouth before I can stop them.<br><br><br><i>Oh, I exercise control in all things, Mr. de Grasse,</i> he writes. His smile is humorless; he holds my stare impassively. I find that I&#39;m blushing again. Why does he have such an unnerving effect on me? His overwhelming good-looks maybe? The way his eyes blaze at me? The way he strokes his index finger against his lower lip? I wish he’d stop doing that. I look down at the Guardsman&#39;s next card; time to change the subject.<br><br>“You invest in manufacturing,&quot; I say. &quot;Why, specifically?” Why does he make me so uncomfortable?<br><br><i>I like to build things. I like to know how things work: what makes things tick, how to construct and deconstruct. And I have a love of ships. What can I say?</i> What can he write, really...why does he write all the time? The Guardsman never mentioned he was mute. No one does. And surely someone with his money could go around that...<br><br><br>But I stay on task. “That sounds like your heart talking rather than logic and facts.”<br><br><br>His mouth quirks up, and he stares appraisingly at me.<br><br><br><i>Possibly. Though there are people who’d say I don’t have a heart.</i><br><br><br>“Why would they say that?”<br><br><br><i>Because they know me well.” His lip curls in a wry smile.</i><br><br>“Do you have a philosophy? If so, what is it?”<br><br><i>I don’t have a philosophy as such.</i> he writes. <i>Maybe a guiding principle – Carnegie’s: ‘A man who acquires the ability to take full possession of his own mind may take possession of anything else to which he is justly entitled.’ I’m very singular, driven. I like control – of myself and those around me.</i><br><br>“So you want to possess things?” I try not to raise an eyebrow; he really is a control freak.<br><br><br><i>I want to deserve to possess them, but yes, bottom line, I do.</i><br><br><br>I can’t help thinking that we’re talking about something else, but I’m absolutely mystified as to what it is. I swallow hard. The temperature in the room is rising or maybe it’s just me. I just want this interview to be over. Surely this is enough material? I glance at the next question.<br><br><br>“You were adopted. How far do you think that’s shaped the way you are?” Oh, this is personal. I stare at him, hoping he’s not offended. His brow furrows.<br><br><i>I have no way of knowing.</i><br><br>My interest is piqued, but I don&#39;t ask him how old he was when he was adopted--I can always ask the Guardsman later. I read the next question. “Have you had to sacrifice a family life for your work?”<br><br><i>I have a family.</i> he writes. <i>I have a brother and a sister and two loving parents. I’m not interested in extending my family beyond that.</i><br><br>“Are you gay, Mr. Tacitus?”<br><br><i>Well...</i> He stops writing and looks at me with his smoldering eyes. <i>What do <u>you<u> think, Gaspard?</u></u></i><br><br>My breath catches in my throat as I try to stammer a reply. It&#39;s the first time he&#39;s used my name, and even though he isn&#39;t speaking out loud, there&#39;s something about seeing it in his handwriting that makes my heartbeat accelerate.<br><br>There’s a knock at the door, and Charlie enters. “Mr. Tacitus, forgive me for interrupting, but your next meeting is in two minutes.”<br><br>Tacitus nods at her. She blushes bright pink; at least it&#39;s not just me, thank God. He gets up, and she leaves.<br><br>I collect the cards and the Guardsman&#39;s recorder and get to my feet. “Thank you for meeting with me, Mr. Tacitus.”<br><br>He shakes my hand; I find myself hoping it&#39;s not as sweaty as my mind thinks it is.<br><br>If I am sweaty, he doesn&#39;t seem to notice. <i>Are you driving back?</i> he asks through the pad of paper. <i>It&#39;s raining.</i><br><br>&quot;Uh--yes. I&#39;m driving back.&quot;<br><br><i>Well, you’d better drive carefully.</i> he writes. He underlines it, and gives me a stern look. I wonder why he cares. <i>Did you get everything you need?</i> he adds.<br><br>“Yes sir,” I reply, packing the recorder into my satchel. His eyes narrow, speculatively.<br>“Thank you again for the interview, Mr. Tacitus.”<br><br><i>The pleasure’s been all mine,<i> he writes, polite as ever. He stands and holds out his hand. <i>Until we meet again, Mr. de Grasse.</i> And his expression makes it a challenge, or a threat, I’m not sure which. I frown. When will we ever meet again? I shake his hand once more, astounded that that odd current between us is still there. It must be my nerves.<br><br>“Mr. Tacitus.” I nod at him. Moving with lithe athletic grace to the door, he opens it wide.<br><br><i>Just ensuring you make it through the door, Miss Steele.<i> he writes, holding it up for me to see and giving me a small smile. Obviously, he’s referring to my earlier less-than-elegant entry into his office. I flush.<br><br><br>“That’s very considerate, Mr. Tacitus,” I snap, and his smile widens. I’m glad you find me entertaining, I glower inwardly, walking into the foyer. I’m surprised when he follows me out. Charlie and Alex both look up, equally surprised.<br><br>Alex rushes to bring my coat; Tacitus puts down his pen and pad of paper and takes it from him, holding it up for me to put on. I do so, feeling extremely self-conscious. Tacitus places his hands for a moment on my shoulders; I gasp at the contact. If he notices my reaction, he gives nothing away. His long index finger presses the button summoning the elevator, and we stand waiting – awkwardly on my part, coolly self-possessed on his. The doors open, and I hurry in desperate to escape. I really need to get out of here. When I turn to look at him, he’s leaning against the doorway beside the elevator with one hand on the wall. He really is very, very good-looking. It’s distracting. His burning teal eyes gaze at me.<br><br><i>Gaspard,</i> he writes as a farewell, holding up the ever-present pad of paper.<br><br>“Tacitus,” I reply, my mouth dry. And mercifully, the doors close.<br><br>--------<br><br>a/n:Whew! That was such a long chapter!! But Ireally hope you liked it!! Isn&#39;t Tacitus so hott?? Gaspard certainly thinks so!!<br><br>Don&#39;t forget to RnR!! Reviews make me write fasterrr. Next up--Gaspard and the Guardsman talk about what happened! And Tacitus may show up again ;)) Aaaaand...if you really want it....Imay even write something from Tacitus&#39; pov!! You&#39;ll have to convince me, though :D if there&#39;s enough interestm I&#39;ll totally do it!!!<br><br>Reviweres are love!!! ~*DW~~**<br><br>PS: DON&#39;T FORGET TO CHECK OUT MY NEW STORY! It&#39;s actually something I rwote really quickly last month but it&#39;s awesome and you should totally read it! I&#39;ll be putting it up really soon. Quick and fun and fluffy!!

            <p>Hello All. It has been a while since last we have conversed. I comprehend how things appear aboungst my astute readership. Truth of the matter and telling is, I realize my former tales were lacking in several critical, necessary means. It has come to my observation, that my previous writings were, to be frank, ineligible. For this, I deeply apologize. However, I have made measures to ensure my future endeavors are properly complex, literature deserving of peoples attention. It may take quite some time before I am able to share the stoies with you, but I assure you, I am working post-haste.<br><br>Yours in this verce or the next:<br><br>xX-VerceMaster-Xx</p>

            <p>AN: Thanks fore the good reviews on the last Chapter. They were good. Thank you.<br><br>Zeb will have a bowl of liquid water last chapter. Zeb used to use the bull for pranking Rina. Rina will be in her bed. Now Zeb is pranking Rina. Zeb putt the bull of water on Rinas bed. Rina had been in that bed. Zeb will have put Rinas hand in the bowl of hot water. Zeb is careful two know spill the liquid water beecause it will be on Rinas bed. Rina was in that bed and Zeb doesnt want too get Rina to wet with water that used to bee inn the bull. When Zeb will have put Rinas hand inn the bowl Zeb is redy to prank Rina. Zeb thinks pranking Rina would bee funny because Rina was still inn Rina bed. Zeb then used to be ready to prank Rina. Rina will have know idea of this because Rina will have been asleep in Rinas bed. Zeb finally pranked Rina. Zeb zaps the liquid water with a zap. Zebs zap is small because he didnt want too hurt Rina. Rina is now zapped by Zebs zap. Zebz zap went into the water because water will help zaps. zaps will go through water and zap what is in the water. Rinas had used to be in the water. The rest of Rina will be inn her bed. Rina felt the zap of Zeb zapping her. Rinas hand is wet from the wet water that zeb will put in the bull. Zeb thinks Zebs zap zapping rina will be funny. Zeb laughed because the zap zapped Rina. Rina didnt laugh because Rinas hand got zapped bye Zebs zap. When Rina will become zapped by the zap Rina used to spill the water on the bed. Rina is in the bed. Rina will now bee wet because the wet water will make Rinas bed wet. Rina becomes wet because Rinas bed is wet with wet water. <br><br>AN: Is mi stori good? Do yew want to no what will have happened next? Review please.<br></p>

<br><br>Agen Luxury was talking to a packed classroom. Her course on Sex Education was by far the most popular at the Official Fanfiction University of the PPC (OFUP).  Almost the entire school had signed up for it, and although half the students had dropped out when they discovered there weren&#39;t going to be any pratical demonstrations, there were still ewnough to fill every seat in the room.<br><br>&quot;And so, when wrting a BadSlash mission, the hottest, coolest, sexiest thing is always...&quot;<br><br>[BRRRRRRING]<br><br>The sound of the bell interrupted her, and the students started to pack their things and stand up.<br><br>&quot;Joan Martens,&quot; saud Luxury, &quot;could you stay behind?&quot;<br><br>The other students all cheered and wolf-whistled, but the tennage girl with long, wavy, chocolate-brown hair just blushed, which magde the frecckles on her cheeks stand out even more.<br><br>&quot;What us it you want, miss?&quot; asked the girl, wehn all the others had left.<br><br>&quot;It&#39;s a about that assignment you handed in. Write a short story about romance in the PPC.&quot;  Luxury piclked up the fic in question from her desk.  She glanced at it then back at Joan who was fidgiting nervaously.  &quot;You had  your OC, Agent Kim Coffee, get pregnant by the Sunflower Official.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Is that a problem?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Agent Kim Coffee is a <i>man</i>!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yes, but flowers have male and female parts, so maybe the S.O. could make him pregnant, some how.&quot;<br><br>Luxury sighed. &quot;I see you&#39;re going to have to have my own special tutition if you&#39;re ever going to get Permission.&quot;<br><br>Joan gulped. She didn&#39;t like to imagine what Luxury had in mind for her. She certainly wasn&#39;t expecting to be smacked about the head with a larg hardback book called <i>Your First Time.</i><br><br>&quot;Read that, and write me a detailed book report by...&quot;<br><br>Once again, Agent Luxury was interrupted. This time it was by the door bursting open, and Agent The Guardsman busting into the classroom. He was wearing his full DIA uniform, and pushing a woman with long, curly, dark-purple hair infront of him.<br><br>&quot;What is it?&quot; snapped Agent Luxury. &quot;I&#39;m in the middle of something right now. Not that I mind a man in uniform visiting me at any time. Or a man out of uniform. Or a woman in or out of u... Never mind. Just what&#39;s this about?&quot;<br><br>&quot;It&#39;s about her,&quot; said Agent The Guardsman, point AT THE woman. &quot;She&#39;s the notorious traitor Vim...&quot;<br><br>&quot;I&#39;m not a traitor!&quot; yellee d the woman. &quot;And I&#39;ll intorduce myself.  I&#39;m Vimto Hydrate, and I&#39;m here to warn you...&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yopu&#39;re here because we caught you sneaking in.&quot; He turned back to Luxury. &quot;We arrewsted her in the corridor near the S.O.&#39;s office, but we&#39;ve nowhere to keep her, because the DIA doesn&#39;t have any holding ce;lls.&quot;<br><br>&quot;What, none?&quot; asked Luxury.<br><br>&quot;No, none. And we&#39;re not likelt to get any unless a Time Lord Sue turns up whose Suefluence is so greayt it throws the whole department out of character at once.  And there&#39;s no way that&#39;s ever going to happen.&quot; He paused, trying to regain his train of thought. &quot;Anyway, that&#39;s why we need your help. You&#39;ve got lots of handcuffs and chains and things, so we wondered if we could borrow some.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Hmmm... OK,&quot; said Luxury, opening a cupboard next to the blackboard, and removing equipment, &quot;but you can&#39;t have my special faux-fur-lined leg irons. I&#39;m using them on a date with the Librarian tonight.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Look, I&#39;ve aready explained,&quot; sighed Vimto.  &quot;I&#39;ve come back to help you. You don&#39;t need chains to keep me here.&quot;<br><br>&quot;But you could try the chains nayway,&quot; suggested Luxury.  &quot;They&#39;re really good ones. Look, this one&#39;s got little red ribbons on it.&quot;<br><br>Vinmto rolled her dark eyes. &quot;No. I just want someone to listen to me.  S.W.I.F.T. is going to attack the PPC.&quot;<br><br>Luxury dropped the chains, her eyes widening in shock. &quot;The slash wraith people? Weren&#39;t they all defeateed in the Restructuring War?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Exactly,&quot; said the Guardsman. &quot;She&#39;s talking nonsense.&quot;<br><br>&quot;No, two of their farms still remaind. They&#39;re now the Slash Wraith Incubation Farms Twosome, instead of Team. And they&#39;re going to trick some elvish rights people into attacking HQ first, weakening us. Then they step in for the kill.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Well,&quot; said Luxury, &quot;it wouldn&#39;t hurt to send someone to infiltrate S.W.I.F.T just to cheack it out. I volunteer!&quot;<br><br>The Guardsman gave a shudder at the thought of Luxury loose in the home of slash. &quot;No, you&#39;re too much of a ris... I meam, you&#39;re much to valuable to us here. You&#39;re the onl one who with whips and thumbscrews for interrogating Ms. Hydrate.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Hey!&quot; yelled his prisoner.<br><br>&quot;What we need,&quot; continued the Guardsman, &quot;is someone expendable. Someone who won&#39;t be missed if this is a trap, but who can successfully claim to be interested in bad slash if it&#39;s genuine, and who&#39;s stupid enough to volunteer. Can you think of anyone like that?&quot;<br><br>The silence as the three of them racked their brains was eventually broken by a small voice asking, &quot;Uh, miss, when did you want that book report?&quot;<br><br>The three adults turned to look at Joan.<br></p>

            <p><b>AN: The PPC belongs to Jake and Acapulco who created it, but I wish it was mine, all mine.  SWIFT is mine, and I&#39;m gonna be typoing it without periods from now on, cos that&#39;s easier.</b><br><br>--------
<br><br>The room was a mix of a modern corporate boardroom and the great hall of a medieval castle. A long, pinkish-grey table stood in the middle, surrounded by pinkish-grey exectutive chairs. On the wall beyond one end of the table was a large screen for displaying PowerPoint presentations.  However, the wall itself was made of large stones, like the other walls which were decorated with banners showing emblems of flying birds.  Curved archways lead into dark passages.  Tall pillars soard up to the vaulted roof.  And the whole place was lit by flamming torches.<br><br>Paslee Torhan got up from her seat at the head of the table. She was an Asian Woman in her early thirties.  Her dark black hair ran in a straight cascade down her back, and the long bangs of her fringe hid the delicate bronze skin of her forehead, allowing her eyes to peep out from underneath it, like two deep pools beneath a dense shrubbary in a m,usterious garden.<br><br>She stood up, strightend her designer, baclk trouser suit, and adressed the people siutting in the pinkish-grey chairs around the table.<br><br>&quot;Fellow deparment heads, and other members of SWIFT, welcome to our fist general board meeting since our assets were halved in the unprovoked attacks carried out by the PPC four years ago. The wraith farm in Liliput had been set up as a dummy target for such attacks, so we weren&#39;t surprised when it was crushed underfoot by a PPC thug.&quot;<br><br>She paused and took a deep breath before continuing.<br><br>&quot;The loss of the farm in the land of the Yahoos was unexpected. Apparently, two PPC adjitators called Alice amnd Printworthy persuaded the Houyhnhnms to side with them. That was something we hadn&#39;t anticipated.  I&#39;d like to hold a minutes&#39; silence for all the men, women, and slash wriaths lost with those farms.&quot;<br><br>Paslee lowered her head, and the others did the same. All this recent history was known to Paslee&#39;s audience, of course, but reminding them of it was a good way to start the meeting.  Once the minute was over, she resumed her speech.<br><br>&quot;However, the good news is that the staff at our farm in Brobdingnag managed to stand up to the PPC. And, of course, this one here in Laputa,&quot; -- she gestured around her -- &quot;managed to avoid attack by flying the island faster than the PPC pprtal devices could target it.  Since then , we have been building up our strength, and I know thjat with your help and hard work, we can grow to become even stronger than before,&quot;<br><br>She went on to discuss facts and figures in details, with representatives of the different sections of the different wraith farms each making thweir reports. When all this was done, they moved on to the final item on the agenda.<br><br>&quot; &#39;Any other business.&#39; I believe Septannus Batraic has something to say.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Thank you,&quot; said the bearded man sitting three chairs down on her right.  He stood up.  &quot;Now, our return to the slashfic business will mean nothing unless we can stand up to the PPC.  As a few opf you already know, and as some of you may have guessed, us in the Farms Defense Sectiopn have been making plans.&quot; He paused rubbed his neatly trimmed brown beard with the back of his right hand. &quot;We&#39;re going to attack the PPC and take it out.&quot;<br><br>Gasps came from around the table.  Paslee just smiled to herself, pleasd by the reaction, and kept on watching<br><br>Batraic continued, &quot;Of course, we can&#39;t go in unprepared.   I don&#39;t know if you&#39;ve heard of EYE-PATCH, the Elvish -- Yes, Elvish -- People Against Those Crazy Humans.  I&#39;ve sent some of my people to a few modest proposals to them, and stir them up against the PPC.  They will weaken it, and we&#39;ll step in for the kill.&quot;<br><br>--------
<br>After the meeting was over, Paslee returned to her quarters and poured herself a stiff drink.  She sat buy the arched window, looking out throught it diamond panes at the farm buildings below.<br><br>Taking a long sip of her whisky, wondered if protecting tha twas really worth kiling the innocent civilians and children in PPC HQ.  Wouldn&#39;t that make SWIFT no better than the PPC agents themselves?<br><br>Without realising it, she had raised a hand up to brush the hair out of her eyes.  And she felt <i>it</i>, there above her left eybrow, taunting her as usual with its presence.<br><br>SHe finished her drink with a large gulp, and slammed the glass down on her desk.  At least they&#39;d be giving those civilians and children gift of a swift, clean death.  SOmething that Paslee would never be lucky enough to experience herself.<br></p>

            <p><b>AN: WHy is nobdoy Reviewing my story? Please R&amp;R. The baddies will be attacking HQ in a few chappies time so leave a Review to say if you want your agents involved int he fight.  Anywat, I don&#39;t own the BBC, it belongs to Joe and Accumulator.</b><br><br>--------
<br><br>FDormer Agent Daffy &quot;Duckie&quot; Illion slowly recovered consciousness.  His head throbbed as though he&#39;d drunk a whole barrel of DOrwinion wine. Had he? No, he didn&#39;t remeber drinking last night, although that didn&#39;t mean very much.<br><br>He slowly opened one eye and saw an unfamiliar ceiling. A cieling so completely unfamilar that even Shinji&#39;s would seem like an old friend next to to it.  Daffy slowly sat up, and looked around. He was in some kind of prison cell. At least it was a British-style cell, with four walls and a solid door, rather than an American-style with three walls and some bars to let in the draught. For some reason, the seemed to reassure him.<br><br>He reached his hand up to his head, and felt a lump.  Someone had knocked him out and brought him here. Well, either thaqt or he&#39;d brought himself here and banging his head on the wall until he passed out. But he couldn&#39;t think of any reason why he&#39;d want to do that.<br><br>Yes, now it was starting to come back to him. His son, little Silmar Illion had been playing with the balloon dragon the scary clown lady had given them. &quot;RAAARR! RAARRR!&quot; But then it had burst. Daffy had tried to make a new one, but it was toohard with only one hand. So he had openned a portal back to HQ to ask the scary clown lady for another one. But the portal hadn&#39;t led to HQ. It led to a dark place, where someone had attacked him from behind.<br><br>No sooner had Daffy finished rememebering all this, when the cell door opened, and a stunningly beautiful Elf princess walked in. She had golden sapphire eyes, and her luminous hair flowed like a river down the back of her slender-yet-nicely-curvy body. Her ears were the pointiest Daffy had ever seen.  However, what he noticed first were the weapons hanging from the belt atound her beautiful blue and gold gown.<br><br>With one hand on her sword hilt, she said, &quot;Welcome to EYE-PATCH, traitor.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Who are you calling traitor, Sue?&quot;<br><br>&quot;You.&quot; Her other hand dropped down towards one of the daggers. &quot;You killed your fellow Elfs in the Kin&#39;s Laying. You killed Elf proncesses like me when you joined the PPC. And you rejected your Elven heritage when you chose mertality and married a character from the Simms.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Why not? Elfs are just Erúuvatar&#39;s unsuccessful first attempt at creating intelligent life, before He got it right the second time. Accepting the truth isn&#39;t treason.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Lies!&quot;  The warrior!Sue leapt forward. If Daffy&#39;s head hadn&#39;t been hurting so much, he would&#39;ve been easily able to avoid the attack, but as it was, he found himself trapped as the Sue had her dagger at Daffy&#39;s thrat. &quot;You&#39;ll come round to our way of thining, traitor,&quot; she stated, &quot;or my name isn&#39;t Princess Ashera Fayleniel.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Uh, is that your name?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Of course it is.&quot; She stepped back and re-sheathed her dagger. &quot;Come.&quot;<br><br>A snap of her fingers brought a groinsaw-wielding Dobby bursting into the room. He ushered Daffy out, and Ashera  followed.<br></p>

Yo&#39;re the wrst kind of flamers, cos you don&#39;t even have the courage tro post your flames. You just keep them secret, and that&#39;s sneaky.  Anywzy, the PC is owned by James and Architeuthis who created them.</b><br><br>--------
<br><br>&quot;I&#39;m not a traitor,&quot; stated Vimto for the 81st time that day.<br><br><i>&quot;And why should we believe you,&quot; </i>sneered the Marquis du Sod. <i>&quot;After all, you murdered the Nameless Nobody.&quot;</i><br><br>&quot;It was self-defense!&quot; yelled Vimto. &quot;And it wasn&#39;t the Nameless Nobody, it was the Enigmatic Everyman.&quot;<br><br><i>&quot;So who killed the Nameless Nobody?&quot; </i>asked the Sunflower Official.<br><br>&quot;That was my partner, Agent Electromagnetic Wave of 640THz.&quot;<br><br><i>&quot;Was that really his nmae?&quot; </i>asked the Quuen Anne&#39;s Lace.<br><br>&quot;Yes, he was a Hooloovoo. They have names like that.&quot;<br><br><i>&quot;So,&quot; </i>snapped the Maruis du Sod, trying go get this conversation bak on track, <i>&quot;you&#39;re saying that he was the traitor?&quot;</i><br><br>&quot;No, he only killed him because he had been brainwashed by the Anonymous Anyone.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Who had been brainwashed?&quot; asked Queen Anne, who was visiting HQ to see her Lace. &quot;Your partner, or the Nameless Nobody?<br><br>&quot;Perhaps she&#39;ll tell the truth quicker if I whip her,&quot; said Luxury.<br><br><i>&quot;No whipping her!&quot; </i>stated the S.O.<br><br>&quot;Oh, then maybe can she whip me instead?&quot; Luxury held out the whip towards Vimto.<br><br><i>&quot;No-one is whipping anyone unless I say so!&quot;</i><br><br>&quot;Even if they do say Jehovah,&quot; muttered Vimto sarcasticly.<br><br><br>--------
<br>Joan Martens sat at the edge of the Boardroom, listening to the discussion, and not followng most of it. For the first time since joining OFUP, she wished she&#39;d payed attention in the History classes.<br><br>She sighed. When were they going to get to the bit about the slash waith incubation farms? Not only would that be important to her special assignment, but it sounded a lot more fun than all this bickering.<br><br>--------
<br>Finally, however, everyone managed to come to an agreement. Vimto&#39;s alleged treason was apparently all the Inexplicable Individual&#39;s fault; although none of them could explain why.<br><br>With that out of the way, Vimto explained that after she had fled from the PPC, she had been been hidig in various Word Worlds. One of them, was Gulliver&#39;s Luggnagg but in the modern day.<br><br>&quot;I just portalled to it in Gulliver&#39;s time, and used the Fic Location Follower to jumpo forward to the present. I knew I&#39;d be safe there, since although there are stories with a modern Lilliput, and even modern Laputa, nobody writes modern Luggnagg, whICH is a shame when you think about it, cos it&#39;s got such an interesting gimmick.&quot;<br><br>She&#39;d been there about three weeks when she overheard someone say &quot;PPC&quot; in a cafe-bar. At firest sho thought it was someone come to arrest her, but when she turned round, she saw it was just two people talking. Listening, she heard that they were discussinmg recruiting peopleto help with the attack on HQ.<br><br>Once her story was complete, the S.O. stated, <i>&quot;Student Martens, do you understand what you have to do.?&quot;</i><br><br>&quot;I think so. I have to go to this Luggage place, read a lot of slash in cybercafes and on my cellphone, and even post it, until someone contacts me. Then I go with them, learn what they&#39;re up to, and phone you to let you know. Right?&quot;<br><br><i>&quot;Well, that&#39;s close enough, I suppose&quot; </i>said the Marquis de Sod. His voice slowly became even more bitter and resentful as he continued, <i>&quot;If you mange that without screwing up, we&#39;ll give you Permission right away. You won&#39;t even need to finish the rest of the OFUP course.&quot;</i><br><br>&quot;Thank you.&quot;<br><br>The portal opened up. Joan picked up her bag, and stepped into it.<br></p>

            <p><b>In this chappie you finally get to find out what the title means. You&#39;ve been waithing for that, haven&#39;t you? The PPC was created by Jade and Acromantula, and <i>&quot;The Lords of the Ring&quot; </i>is by J.R. Tolkein.</b><br><br>--------
<br><br>&quot;This quest may be attempted by the weak with as much hope as the strong,&quot; said Elrond. &quot;Yet such is oft the course of deeds that move the wheels of the world: small hands do them because they must, while the eyes of the great are elsewhere.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Very well, very well, Master Elrond!&quot; said Bilbo suddenly. &quot;Say no more! It is plain enough what you are pointing at. Bilbo the silly hobbit started this affir, and Bilbo had better finish it, or himself.&quot;<br><br>--------
<br><br>Looking on from the edge of the courtyard, Daffy said: &quot;Nice to see a Bookverse version of the council for a change.&quot; Neither Ashera nor groinsaw!Dobby replied. Daffy risked speaking some more: &quot;And it&#39;s pretty canonical to. A bit rushed in places, and a few typos, but no random ELf princesses from faraway lands disrupting things. You must really hate that.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Shut up, and watch&quot; said Ashera, as Dobby pressed his groinsaw against Daffy&#39;s bacl.<br><br>While they had been talking, Gandalf had persuaded Bilbo not to take the RIng to Mordor.<br><br>As the Hobbit sat down again, Elrond added: &quot;As t who started this affair, you could say it was I by failing to persuade Islidur to destory it while he had the chance. Yes, I started it,and now I will finish it. I will bear the Ring to Mount Doom.&quot;<br><br>&quot;What!?&quot; yelled Daffy. Luckily nobody notices as both Frodo and Boroomir had yelled the same thing at the same time.<br><br>&quot;You can&#39;t,&quot; insisted Frodo. &quot;It&#39;s too prec... to valu... I mean <i>you&#39;re </i>too valuable to risk loike that.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Exactly,&quot; said Boromir. &quot;You need to sty here and guard RIvendell.&quot;<br><br>&quot;My grate-grandfather thought he could help his people by shutting them away and gaurding them in a hidden city. He&#39;s dead, and so are most of his people.&quot; Elrond sighed and gave an uncomfortable glance at Glorfidnel, who gave a slight nod in return. &quot;I will not t make the same mistake. My mind is made up. I will take the ring.&quot;<br><br>He stepped forward and picked it up.<br><br>Glofrindel stepped forward and put his hand on Elrond&#39;s shulder.  &quot;You have my horse.&quot;<br><br>--------
<br><br>Arriving back through the portal to the palace-like lair of Elvish - Yes, Elvish - People Against Those Crazy Humans, Daffy spluttered with rage.<br><br>&quot;What have you done? You sent a Sue Wraieth to posess Elrond? Really?&quot;<br><br>&quot;A Ficcubus, acutally,&quot; grinned Dobby.<br><br>&quot;Why are you so upset?&quot; asked Ashera. &quot;I&#39;d of thought you&#39;d be proud to see your foester son finally fulfulling all his Elvish potential.&quot;<br><br>&quot;My fost...?&quot; Daffy rolled his eyes. &quot;Not that old nonsense! He and Elvis were my <i>hostages </i>in case  E&amp;aumlaut;lendil ever returned. &#39;Your Silmarril in exchange for your kids.&#39; &quot; He raised a hand to his temple, and sighed. &quot;But never mind that. Doesn&#39;t posessing Elfs with Ficcubusses go against your principles.&quot;<br><br>She shugged. &quot;He was only a &#39;Helf&#39;, a Half-Elf. We&#39;ve just given him a step up.&quot;<br><br>&quot;But you can&#39;t do that and expect everything to be OK.&quot;<br><br>&quot;We can and we do.&quot; replied Dobby.<br><br>&quot;All right tehn. A moderately intellignent person can&#39;t do that and expect everything to be OK. The Word Worlds are an important part of Inner Sapce, the collective uncoscious. Warp them, and there&#39;ll be side effects.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Such as?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Well, did you see the way Elrond and Glorfindle were looking at each other back then?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Ah,&quot; Ashera looked at the floor, embarrassed. &quot;That&#39;s probably because we got our Ficcubusses as a special offer from SWIFT.&quot;<br><br>&quot;The slash wraith people?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yes, they said we could have some general purpoe Ficubuses at cheap rate if we...&quot;<br><br>Before se could say any more, she was interrupted by a loud throbbing, humming noise from a plantir on a pedastal in the center of the room. She ran over to it and looked within.<br><br>&quot;Yes, I understand.&quot; She turned to Dobby. &quot;The Boss has a special assignment for me. Take our guest back to his room.&quot;<br></p>

            <p><b>(Fictional)</b> <i>Author&#39;s Note: Hi everyone, it&#39;s Jane Martens here again, with another story of my kewl OC Kim Coffee!!!  Thanx for all your kewl revviews, keep &#39;em coming!!!<br><br>Disclaimer: The PPC was created by Jay and Acacia, and Jay and Accacia were created by Renn and Stimpy, and Renn and Stimpy were created by John Kricfalusi, and John Kricfalusi was created by his parents, so I guess his parents own the PPC.  They haven&#39;t given me Permission, but I don&#39;t care, I&#39;m gonna write about it anyway, and if they don&#39;t like it, then tuff!!!  I don&#39;t care what those boring nerds in charge of the PPC think!!!  They should all be replaced anyway!!!  And Agent Super Badass McGee was ceated by Sparkles badass Sue Hunter, and he can keep him cuz he sucks!!!<br><br>. . . . .<br><br>Agent Kim Coffee was sitting on the armchair in his RC, and he was drinking a cup of coffee, and then the console went [BEEEEEEP]!!!<br><br>“Oh, no!!!!” yelled Agent Kim as his coffee spilled all over his swelling belly, and then he said, “I&#39;m supposed to be called Coffee, not covered in it!!!” and then he laughed at his joke and laughed and laughed and laughed cuz the joke was so funny, and then he stopped laughing and said “I hope that hot coffee didn&#39;t hurt my unborn baby!!!”<br><br>The console was still going [BEEEEEEP] so Agent Kim went over to it and stopped it and looked at the screen, and then he saw that he had been given a mission!!!<br><br>“I can&#39;t have a mission!!!  I&#39;m in the fourth trimester of my pregnancy with the S.O.&#39;s baby!!!”<br><br>But then he looked again and saw that he really did have a mission, and then he read the fic and he knew that it had to be stopped cuz it was really really bad, and so he decided to do the mission anyway even though he was pregnant!!!<br><br>He got his stuff together and opened a portal and stepped through and found himself in what looked like a corridor of the PPC but he unfocused his eyes and saw the words and knew that he was in the fic and disguised as himself.<br><br>The Stu came walking down the corridor, and he was carrying a gun and muttering to himself about how heterosexual he was, and he went to the S.O.&#39;s office and pointed his gun at the S.O.!!!<br><br>But the Agent Kim pointed his gun at the Stu and said “Agent Super Badass McGee, you are charged with being a homophobe and hating slash and hating my boyfriend, and I&#39;m gonna kill you!!!” and then Agent Kim killed him.<br><br></i>Thank you for saving me, my love!!! <i>said the S.O. and then it said </i>Now our child will have two daddies to love it!!!<i><br><br>“Yes!!!” said Agent Kim, and he and the S.O. kissed and had sex and then he left the fic and went back to his RC.<br><br>“Killing Agent McGee was fun!!!” he said to himself and the he added “I&#39;m going to kill all the homophobes in the PPC, and I&#39;m starting with the DBS because they don&#39;t understand there&#39;s no such thing as bad slash, it&#39;s <b>all</b> good!!!” </i><br><br>--------
<br><br>Jane pressed Send and uploaded the fic to FFW.  It had takn her less time to write than she imagined, but she hoped it was the sort of thing that would catch SWIFT&#39;s attrntion.<br><br>She turned her head adn glanced out of the cybercafe&#39;s window. Across the road was bar where Vimto had said she heard the poeople talking. Jane didn&#39;t know what she was lookig for; there was no way she&#39;d recognose the people if they went there aganin.<br><br>She truned her attentin back to the computer, and started on Real Person Fic about Xander and his Pointless friend Richard.<br></p>

As usual, the PPC is own by Kay and Echinacea who carted it.</b><br><br>-------- <br><br>It always felt strange returning to Luggnagg.  This was where Paslee had been born and raised, and where one day she would be rejected and declared an unperson.<br><br><i>One day, </i>she thought bitterly to herself, <i>one day ecxatcly 43 years, seven months and sixten days from nopw.</i><br><br>She was still less than halfway through her official lifespan, but she knew the day woud come. Plenty of time to propare for it.<br><br>She tried to clear her head of such thoughts as she entred The Spot. Septannus Batraic was waiting for her one of the tables.<br><br>&quot;Ms. Torhan,&quot; he said. &quot;I alreasy ordered something for you. Hope you don&#39;t mind.&quot; He gestured to a neat double whisky on the table.<br><br>&quot;Thanks.&quot; She sat down, drank the whisky in one go, and signalled to the barman for another one.<br><br>&quot;Are you sure you should be doing that?&quot; asked Batraic. &quot;I know it won&#39;t kill you, but won&#39;t you still fell the pain if your liver gets damaged.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Maybe, but it&#39;ll still make me feel alive.&quot; She raised a hand to her hair, and lifted the bangs revaling the red spot above her left eyebrow. &quot;Look at it. You would&#39;t think that it means I&#39;ll have to spend eterinity forever aging, never dying. What did that English poet say? &#39;Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything.&#39; Except I won&#39;t be able to &#39;end this strange eventful history&#39;.&quot;<br><br>&quot;French poet, surelt. &#39;Sans&#39; isn&#39;t an English word.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Maybe. What&#39;s it matter?&quot; She let her long bangs fall back into place, and turned her attention to the drink the barman had nbrought her.<br><br>Batraic had heard Paslee angst about being a struldbrug before, and knew how to bring her out of it. &quot;At least your&#39;re making themost of your facilities while you&#39;ve till got them. Living life to the full, like you&#39;re doing with SWIFT&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yeah. Gotta take life&#39;s pleasures while I can still enjoy them. And I&#39;ve always enjoyed slash fics.|&quot; She paused then added, &quot;My mother used top write it too. Bergerford slash for fanzines.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Bergerford?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Jim Bergerac/Charlie Hungerford. The most slashable couple the BBC ever created.&quot;<br><br>&quot;What, more than John and Sherlock?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Oh yes.  Even more than Blake and Avon.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Who?&quot;<br><br>&quot;You youngsters don&#39;t know anything.&quot; She smiled. &quot;Guess I&#39;ll have tpo get used to saying that a lot in future.&quot;<br><br>&quot;As long as you can say it, you know you&#39;re doing fine.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yeah.  WHat about you. Why did you get involved with SWIFT?&quot;<br><br>He stroked a thumb along his beard. &quot;Notthing fancy. It&#39;s just that me and my boyfirend find the sex is better when a slash wraiths involvwd. No need to worry about hygiene, lubrication, or any of those unsexy things.&quot;<br><br>&quot;There&#39;s the risk of MPreg.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yeah, but&#39;s not a problem. We wouldn&#39;t even have the chance pf our own kid normally.

            <p>Summary: Tghey had it coming!<br>Genre: Revenge fic.<br>Rating: Absolutely brutal.<br><br>In a dark and raony night, an evil centoure scratch the ground of the Forbidden Forest with his hooves and brought up a verry special stone. „Its the Resurrection Stone“, gasped Agent William Grey. „We must destroy it before he summons a swarm of inferi“. „But the story calls it the Lichen Stone“ said Agen venus Jones. „Zombie, Leech, Inferus, its all the same2 answered William. „The stone must be destroyd,“ „But canon says it is undestroyable!“ „Nothing is undestryable if you apply enough force. But we may need some reinforcements.“ „Okay, said Venus and called up the Interdimensional Communacation funtion of the C-Cad. And typed „EMERGENCY! The Lichen Stone must be destroyd!“<br><br>Did you see the message, asked Agent Gabrielle? Apparently Somebody wants us to destroy the Leichenstein“ Dr. Trollenfish looked pover her shoulder. „You got tjis wrong, <i>meine kleine Gabrielle</i>. They mean <i>leichten Stein<i>, a light stone. Spread the news. Leichtenstein musst be destroyed!“<br><br>At the banks of the upprer Rhine, around a giant rock crowned by a castle, portals popped up out of thin air, and agents popped out of the portals. Finish them! Shouted the Sunflower Official, and forcefull spell, rays from plasma riffles and exploding ammunition rained all ofer the castle.<br><br>A/N; There you have it, Liechtenstein. Took me 10 minutes. I&#39;m so angry right now, that I had to rite this under the desk while I actually should have been in a conference, so bare with me if there are anymistakes.

            <p><b>Hey guys, so, this is the first PPC story I have for you. Okay, I may read just one or two stories but they&#39;re basically the same, right? All about this secret MIB-like group that go ahead and kill bad stories. I&#39;m sure this is going to be good. Just lemme know if it&#39;s okay and if any PPC people are here - you&#39;re welcome. I love you all (especially you ladies ;D)</b><br><br>&quot;Hey, Pads, the boss wants to see you.&quot; Agent Troy said, looking at his partner, who was now sleeping on the floor in her dog form. Paddlebrains just opened her eyes lazily and slowly walked out of her office. Nobody would leave her alone: always mission, her partner being all noisy and annoying, she wouldn&#39;t have time for her own. She decided to file a complaint to the higher-ups and change partners.<br><br>Standing before big oaken door to the PPC Leader&#39;s office, Paddle yawned and changed into her human form. She was tall and beautiful woman with fiery red hair, flowing down a crimson river down her back. Her body was perfectly curved and her long arms and legs had some muscle visible under tight-fit t-shirt. She wore high black boots, tight-fit jeans and brown coat, which added to her sexiness. Pads only groaned, &quot;Here we go&quot;, before pushing the door open. <br><br>&quot;Sir? It&#39;s Paddlebrains.&quot; She said, stepping into a poorly-lit room. The marble floor covered by a red carpet led her straight to the mahogany desk of the boss. Walking through the room, Paddles smirked when she noticed the PPC mascot - the big sunflower wearing a suit <b>(A/N.: I got it right, no? This thing&#39;s a mascot, isn&#39;t it?)</b> called Sunny. <br><br>&quot;Enter.&quot; A voice boomed through the hall, even though Pads was right next to the desk. She looked up, seeing a huge figure and prominent mustache of the boss - Mr. Boss, actually. He was an amazing writer who taught the first pair of agents, Jay and Acacia, to travel through fan-fiction dimension and kill those deemed &#39;bad&#39;. He was now looking down at Pads and tapped his bulgy finger onto his desk.<br><br>&quot;Sir?&quot; Pads asked. &quot;Why am I here? If it&#39;s a mission, I can--&quot;<br><br>&quot;No.&quot; Mr. Boss shook his head. &quot;Ms. Paddlebrains, I looked over through your petition and decided to assign you a new partner. He is a new recruit, discovered the PPC just an hour ago, but I am sure you two will get along nicely.&quot;<br><br>If Pads could transformed partialy, she would sprout a tail and wag it furiously. That&#39;s how happy she was. Who said wishes didn&#39;t come true?<br><br><b>A/N.: So that&#39;s it, for now! Tell me what you think. I&#39;m sure I&#39;ve nailed how Pads should react and I know what I want to do next. Let me know what mission do you want Pads and her new partner go on and I&#39;ll see you... in the next chapter~~!</b></p>

            <p>AN OKAY SO this is going to start from Dafydd’s POV! AND BEFORE YOU SAY ANYTHING, IT’S NOT BECAUSE HE’S A WEREWOLF-ELF OKAY I AM NOT RIPPING OF TWILIGHT!!! THANK YOU!!!!!<br><br>JayBird hihihihiiii again!!!!1 Glad to see your back from vacation!!! Have a new chapter as a spesual treat!! :D<br><br>Your sitting on you’re couch reading the Slimramillion for the hundredth time when you hear howling with you’re ears. Oh no you thought I wonder what’s wrong!<br><br>You get up of the couch and run out the door, taking off you’re pants and tiying them to your leg before turning into your wolf form! You’re normally an elf which is really cool but you just like being a wolf too because that’s also really cool. <br><br>You reach the normal meeting clearing and find the other wolves already there. The pack leader, Constance, starts things off<br><br>“I have bad news everyone [name] is back from her honeymoon with Nume.”<br><br>You snarl at the idea. Did that mean [name] was a vampire now?? <br><br>“Dafyd no wait come back!” Constance yelld but you were already running at full speed to the vampire mansion where Supernumberary and his vampire family lives.<br><br>You stop outside and shift back into an elf and put on you’re cloths before going up to the front door and knocking. Doctor Suicide answers it, he looks tired but then again all vampires look tired. You pushed pass him nd into the house where you see [name] on the sofa with a HUGE belly. Next to her is that vamp boy with the stupid blue hair. Wait you think I thought they hated eachother, what are they doing smiling at eachother like this???<br><br>Name] looks up and suddenly smiles “Dafid you came!” she yelle trying to sit up. You’re heart hurts when you look at her.<br><br>The blue haired vamp named Ilrean or something glares at you than pushes [name[ back down on the sofa, “No, lie down or else you’l hurt youself,” he says. “and that could be bad for the babby.”<br><br>You fall to you’re knees next to [name] and begin to cry over seeing your beloved beautyful girl in so much pain. Why did it have to happen like this??<br><br>“I’m sorry” you whisper and take her hand which is really cold like ice except she isn’t a vampire yet.  “Don’t be” she says back and gives you’re hand a squeezee.<br><br>You look up at Supernumerart and glare at him.

            <p>AN: Umm no this has never been a slashfic i made that very clear from the start :/<br><br>Okay, new chapter everyone!!! Enjoy!!!<br><br>You and Numbe go outside and face eachother. You can’t believe he looks so sad but you mentally smack you’re self and remember he was the one who did this to [name].<br><br>“Why didn’t you just get that thing out of her” you asked and Nume shakes his head, “We tried, she won’t let us and Ilraen is making things harder to.”<br><br>“But she’s just a human!” you yell, “she’s not strong, hold her down and drug her!”<br><br>“I cant”, Nume says and his voice is cracked with emotions. “I wanted toand so did Suicide but Ilraen is protecting her, I think he wants the baby. And if he wants the baby Selene will go with whatever he wants since their dating.” he paused. “But maybe she could have babies with you”<br><br>“WOA WOAH WOAH” you yell and hold you’re hands up “That sounds fun but, there has to be another way!” “Well than mayby you can talk to [name], she listens to you” Nume tries.<br><br>“Okay” you say and you and Nume walk back to the house together to talk to [name].<br><br>Idk when the next chapter will be out but more reviews means more sooner!! <br>-MrsSupernumerary<br><br>((For those of you currently WTFig... yes, that is what Edward suggests in the books. And then Jacob fantasizes about &#39;borrowing her for the weekends&#39;. I wish I was kidding. *crawls away to scrub herself with brain bleach*))</p>

            <p>A/n: Okay guys sorry you probably wanted to see more about the pregnancy but i got bored writing it and decided taht since the you have a shorter pregnancy because her kids’ a vanpire baby I could just skip ahead to the birth part :D<br><br>BTW this is still in Daffid’s pov!<br><br>[Name] was absolutely huge now and the baby that she and Nume had decided to name pAddlebraons after [name’s] mother kept kicking so hard it was breaking her ribs. One day she dropped her cup of blood that she had been drinking from because the baby would’nt eat anything else and when she bent to catch it the baby broke her spine!!<br><br>“OH NO THE BABBY’S COMING” nume shouted and got [name] on the operating table but then suddenly Ilrawn who hadn’t eaten in a week his eyes went black! And he tried to eat [name] but then I jumped in front of him and threw him across the room and saved [name] and her monster baby.<br><br>Nume had to use his teeth to get the baby out and sure enough ,it was a girl! “Paddlerains” [name] gasped and held the b pads close to her chest before almost dying of blood loss. Nume started biting her to get her turned into a vampire fast but then she died and I was sent out of the room to do something but then I saw the baby and realized I WAS ILOVE.”<br><br>An: sorry Dafidd fans but you know Nume/you was always the plan, right? :D <br>R&amp;R!!!!<br><br>-MrsSupernumerarty<br></p>

            <p>I haven&#39;t taken a look at it because I don&#39;t know the continua involved, but generally, if you&#39;re not sure if something is badfic or not, it&#39;s best to just leave it alone.

            <p>So, I&#39;ve had this on my mind for a while: why is there only one Dragonball Z fic that we&#39;ve sporked so far? Knowing that a Sue in that continuum would be extremely hard to kill, I figured out a method that should be able to take down ki users.<br><br>After checking the wiki, I found that ki is basically life energy: the stronger a being&#39;s lifeforce, the stronger its ki manipulation. But what if that life energy was taken away? With less energy, a ki user would logically become less powerful. But how to do such a thing?<br><br>Introducing the Scepter of Life Draining and Sanguinite, both from the Minecraft continuum as mods (Twilight Forest and Metallurgy, respectively.) Using the former and weapons made from the latter, Dragonball Z Sues should be taken down with substantially less risk.<br><br>Next, I remembered my days of playing D&amp;D, particularly every adventurer&#39;s nightmare, the rust monster. Then it hit me: the touch of a rust monster&#39;s antennae causes any metal to corrode into uselessness in a matter of seconds, and stats do exist for weapons made from these parts. Using such devices, Sues capable of metalbending, as well as mechanical ones, could be taken down more easily-particularly that Golden Freddy replacement I reported (Considering that Hasbro owns the rights to D&amp;D, it makes sense for it to be there as well!)<br><br>And lastly, I&#39;m a big fan of the Prehistoric Park franchise-a TV series that lasted for one season that starred wildlife expert Nigel Marven going back in time to capture prehistoric animals and bring them to the present, rescuing them from extinction in his zoo, Prehistoric Park. While it has a relatively small fandom, badfic does exist of it, mainly fanmade extra seasons. But the problem here is the creatures: what do we do with them? Personally, I think that the DMFF would be a good home for them. Anyone agree?</p>

            <p>Using extra-canons methods can be allowed if it&#39;s ironically appropriated, or if the canon is really broken, but the Flowers would ask explanations for this, and your agents will pay the price for this. Besides, if you want to kill DBZ Suvians, just drop them on a planet on the verge of destruction, I don&#39;t think glitterbags can survive a planet-shattering kaboom, or deep space for that matter. </p>

            <p>Now, it might work for a Minecraft setting, and there could be laughs at the agents trying to keep the Suvian entity in the trap long enough for the life drain effect to proc. However, a DBZ mission is no place for that, because it&#39;s not canon to the setting. The point is limiting the damage to the continua we work in, not do more by bringing in random gubbins from an assortment of different universes.</p>

            <p>&quot;Are you here?&quot; would be more grammatically correct, but people don’t always speak grammatically, and not doing so adds to the personality of fictive characters. For us non-natives it’s especially difficult to spot what people would or would not say, therefore I’m very reluctant in pointing out grammatical errors between speech marks.<br><br>I’ve seen &quot;You&#39;re here?&quot; often enough in good literature to say that it’s okay here.<br><br>HG</p>

            <p>Alright then. Thank you for that explanation. As a non-native speaker myself, I was not entirely sure wheter is was an actual error. I guess I should follow your attitude towards grammar in dialogue, it seems very wise.</p>

            <p>My work is taking me very far away for the next standardized period of time and I&#39;m going to be surrounded by a pack of lunatics whose only companionship is each other, the very questionable food we get to eat served and cooked by people who did very questionable things to very questionable foodstuffs, and the junk food from the general store everyone goes wild for while we do missions we can&#39;t talk about with lots of acronyms being thrown around and occasionally people when we get overly excited.

            <p>Mind you, I haven&#39;t watched MMPR in years, so I could be wrong, but I could have sworn there are at least a few episodes where they didn&#39;t even transform, never mind using the giant mechas. Like the episode where Trini had to get over her fear of heights? I remember that one stood out to me as a kid because all the rangers refused to transform for some contrived reason or another, even after they were cornered.<br><br>And badficcers will write whatever they like. I can <i>guarantee</i> that somewhere out there is a Power Rangers AU where there are no Power Rangers at all and they all just go to high school and worry about the prom, with not a single mention of a giant mecha.<br><br>Do you even know what Agony in Pink is like? There was absolutely no giant mecha in the entire fic. Like July said, it&#39;s straight-up torture porn.</p>

            <p>...and the impact they have on storytelling.<br><br>As this is a community founded on around the consumption of media, and the preservation of their thematic presentation within derivative works, I thought an exercise in debate over how the presentation and use of creative medium affects greater storytelling. So please, have a warm cup of tea at your side, ready your monocle, and let us chat.<br><br>Also, I will drop the pretentious act.<br><br>So, I was listening to the most recent episode of the Co-Optional Podcast (a fantastic gaming podcast that I highly recommend, even if just for entertainment value. Just know, they do use adult language) when they started discussing the difference between interactive mediums and more traditional storytelling, which then further branched off into a talk over how storytelling in general is affected by the means in which they are presented, such as those that say listening to an audio book is not truly experiencing the story as the author intended, and thus, inferior. I would ask that everybody listen to the appropriate segment of the podcast <a href="https://www.youtube.com/v/TRHIxcLuulQ?start=4623&amp;end=5009">HERE.</a> It is what they say the conversation will be based on. (By all means, listen to the rest of the podcast if you wish. Just a reminder, it is rated Mature for a reason. The clip is not, the podcast is.)<br><br>Feel free to discuss how creative mediums affect storytelling in any way you wish. I do have guiding questions, if you need a springboard for your thoughts, but feel free to simply state your thoughts on the topic at large.<br><br>The guiding questions:<br><br>Do you like audiobooks? Why or why not? Is it because of a personal preference, or are there intrinsic flaws in either medium?<br><br>What are your opinions on adaptations? Do they, on average, help or hinder the original work? Does it matter?<br><br>Why would a creator potentially chose to write a book over a graphic novel, or film a movie over shoot a television show? What intrinsic differences are there that can help or hinder a storyteller convey their message?<br><br>I look forward to reading your Intellectual Responses.</p>

            <p>I cannot really talk about audiobooks, since I only heard one of these things in my life, but it seems they can be interesting, and people who don&#39;t have time for reading, or cannot read, partially sighted persons for instance, can discover new books through them.<br><br>About adaptations... Well, some great works touched an even greater audience through their adaptations, like Lord of the Rings or A Song of Ice and Fire, but once you read the source material, you can&#39;t help but feel that the adaptations will often butcher the source material. Let&#39;s not talk about the translations as well, in one of the french translations of the Dresden Files, someone thought that &quot;vanilla mortal&quot; meant &quot;mortel à la vanille&quot;, or the fact that you can end up with two books for one english book after the translation ...<br><br>I have no real opinions about the other questions, except I prefer, because there is potential for a longer story.</p>

            <p>I feel i cannot yet give any sort of reasonable opinion about audio books<br>because I have exposed myself to the medium precisely once. All I can say is that I like that particular audio book and that I am not disinclined to try another one. <br><br>I think that it is pretty much inevitable that something will be lost in translation, so to speak, when it comes to adaptations, especially when it is case of any longer medium being adapted to film and even especially when comes to any sort of interactive media being adapted to a non-interactive one.<br><br>That doesn&#39;t mean that they have to be necessarily bad though, just severely diferrent experiences. I can even account for at least one case where the movie adaptation was a major improviment on the book.<br><br>With the choice of media, I think it mostly comes down to how you want to convey that message. Books and Visual Novels generally allow you to peer more closely and deeper into the psyche of at least one of characters involved because of the necessary presence of narration. That doesn&#39;t mean that you can&#39;t relate meaningfully to characters in other media, which the contrary, just that relationship will present itself under a different form. Every medium posesses traits that makes its experience radically differently from any other and without which the experience probably wouldn&#39;t be able to work in the same way.<br><br>Take Visual Novels for example. One of my favorites stories out there is Kana Little Sister. Would that experience have worked just as well without any sort of interactivity, without all the different choices, routes <br>and endings? Probably not. But would that experience also have worked without the intimate relationship created by the narration provided by protagonist, without the extensive amount of text involved, the CGI backgrounds, or even the wonderful background music? I am also willingly to wager that it probably wouldn&#39;t have.</p>

            <p>I love audiobooks because they&#39;re super easy to multitask with- drawing, commuting, whatever- though a definite drawback is time. It&#39;s generally a little faster to read the book yourself than listen to an audiobook. For me, audiobooks are generally more relaxing, especially if they have different voices for different characters. :P I don&#39;t believe intrinsic flaws exist in either medium; both have pros and cons. <br><br>Don&#39;t have any particular opinions in adaptation! It really does vary from situation to situation. Good adaptations probably ultimately add to the interest of the work as a whole. Bad adaptations do the opposite. Of course, this then breaks into the semantics of what constitutes &quot;good&quot; and what constitutes &quot;bad&quot;, which can obviously vary from person to person, so.<br><br>As for book vs. graphic novel, some stories are just meant to be in one or the other. If you&#39;ve ever read Neil Gaiman&#39;s &quot;Sandman&quot; comics (and if you haven&#39;t, I highly recommend them, they are <i>so good</i>), you might get what I mean. Could the series have been conveyed well through text alone? Probably. Would it have been effective in its message, themes, or general appeal? In my opinion, probably not! <br>Books with deliberately ambiguous characters or settings also benefit more from written rather than illustrated, as it leaves a certain amount of interpretation up to the reader. <br><br>And movies vs. television series? Probably more &quot;there is way too much important footage to fit this into a single or even two movies, guess we&#39;re making a miniseries&quot; :P miniseries can probably fit in more suspense and cliffhangers, and also have the obvious added bonus of nigh unlimited time for plot lines.</p>

            <p>A Botswanan cheetah called Legolas that was being studied by researchers has been killed, conservationists said. Legolas, named after an elf in Lord of the Rings, helped researchers understand how the animals hunt together. The body was found next to a highway along with a shotgun cartridge, in what Cheetah Conservation Botswana called an &quot;unnecessary and unprovoked attack&quot;.<br><br><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-34448465"><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-34448465">http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-34448465</a></a></p>

            <p>But seriously, what is it people and senselessly killingly animals in  Africa? First and foremost we still have people poaching elephants and rhinos for ivory (when we don&#39;t even need ivory that much anyway), then really recently there was that dentist who shot that lion in Zimbabwe and now this.

            <p>You explored the repercussions of the incident without going overly melodramatic, and kudos to both of you for managing to juggle both Zeb&#39;s feelings and the mission without having either get derailed by the other.<br><br>However, there are some errors:<br>1) <i>The fire-lizard had the advantage; she could fly, whereas Dawn was left dodging minis and abandoned yarn balls right and left.</i><br>Replace that semicolon with a colon.<br><br>2) <i>I&#39;m going to guess this is just a tragic backstory.

That comma after &quot;Zeb&quot; should be either a question mark or a semicolon.<br><br>4) Applebloom the mini-Discord: This one&#39;s not so much as an error as it is an observation. I don&#39;t think that &quot;Applebloom&quot; counts as a mini.<br>From the MLP Wikia:<br><i>&quot;Apple Bloom&#39;s name is spelled as &quot;Applebloom&quot; in the credits of Equestria Games, </i>My Little Pony Equestria Girls: Rainbow Rocks<i>, Bloom &amp; Gloom, and sometimes in IDW comics&quot;.</i><br><br>5) <i>You let them hang around and bad things start happening.</i><br>Now we have a missing comma; this one needs to go after &quot;hang around&quot;.<br><br>6) <i>“And they’re supposed to be the human equivalent of… I think perhaps ten?”</i><br>The CMC can&#39;t be the <i>human</i> equivalent of anything; they&#39;re ponies. You&#39;re trying to state what their level of development is equivalent to in human years. Consider this rewording: &quot;And they&#39;re supposed to be the equivalent of … I think perhaps ten in human years?&quot;<br><br>7) <i>He opened a portal to the Sue’s bedroom later that night.</i><br>Dangling modifier: as written, it can be interpreted as that Zeb waited until later that night to open a portal into the Sue&#39;s bedroom. Obviously, you&#39;re trying to say that Zeb opened a portal to that particular place and time. Please reword that sentence.</p>

            <p>While it has some aspects of YKINMK, there are at least a few concrete biological charges.<br><br>(Disclaimer: I am no Trojanhorse; I don&#39;t know animal biology nearly as well as she did/does, so anything I say should be verified with research.  That said, I&#39;ve obviously got some idea what I&#39;m talking about, just not a veterinarian&#39;s level.)<br><br>Firstly, while it&#39;s theoretically possible that female dinosaurs had vaginas similar to those of mammals, it&#39;s unlikely, as no known reptiles or birds (the two &quot;ends&quot; of dinosaur evolution) have them.  It&#39;s impossible to know for sure, since soft tissues don&#39;t fossilize, but I feel this fic&#39;s explicit naming of the <s><i>Veloci</i></s> <i>Deinonychus&#39;</i> reproductive organ as a vagina is incorrect.  Amphibians don&#39;t have vaginas either, so the frog DNA wouldn&#39;t help explain their presence.  <s>Not that it explains their lack of feathers or incorrect size for <i>Velociraptor</i> either, lazy stupi</s><br><br>On a much broader note, any animal in a stressful situation, like being in an unfamiliar environment with no visible means of escape (the transport container) is very likely to lash out at something that has it cornered, but they&#39;re certainly not going to switch to mating mode this quickly, especially not with an organism outside their species.  (Some animals with very group-oriented social structures, like, squirrel monkeys, do use mating as stress relief, but that&#39;s generally when a perceived danger has passed, and they feel sheltered within their group dynamic again.  Raptor dinosaurs may very well have had complex group socialization like that, but they wouldn&#39;t gain a calming feeling from an unfamiliar creature not their species.)<br><br>Random thing I just noticed: The fic refers to its raptors as <i>Velociraptor Antirrhopus</i>, which is an old, defunct classification for what is now called <i>Deinonychus antirrhopus</i>.  Not necessarily a charge, considering how the <i>Jurassic Park</i> films have permanently confused the planet as to what <i>Velociraptor</i> really looked like, but I wanted to mention it.<br><br>Now, for something a bit more opinionated: There are clearly a handful of fetishes in here, but the one I have an issue with is the bestiality.  Because animals are not sentient, they are not capable of giving consent; therefore, I consider any usage of animals in a sexual activity to be animal abuse.  Even a fictional extinct animal that eats the human partner at the end.  Obviously, as a person literally paid to protect animals, I&#39;m possibly more bothered by this than most, but I couldn&#39;t discuss this story without bringing that up.<br><br>Finally, let&#39;s look at Muldoon.  (Movieverse here, as it&#39;s been too long since I read the novel to discuss it properly.)  Obviously, any shipping/smutty/fetish story can potentially add details to a character&#39;s personality to make the scenario possible.  However, in this case, one of movie!Muldoon&#39;s very distinct traits has been lost: His canon self is very much a protective figure towards other characters.  He&#39;s basically in charge of safety on Isla Nublar; he tried to save the other worker who got grabbed in the movie&#39;s opening scene; he left himself exposed in the open to cover Dr. Satler&#39;s run for the maintenance bunker, which got him killed, but led to all of the remaining (after that point) characters surviving.  In this fic, Muldoon leaves another person in mortal peril just for his own personal gratification.  That&#39;s a level of out-of-character beyond the basic pornfic, I think.<br><br>Sorry, this is probably way more than you wanted, but it&#39;s not often one of the badfic threads has a fandom I actually care about, so I wanted to way in.  So in short, I do think there&#39;s enough here for a mission.  Then again, I&#39;ve only written three myself, so what do I know?  :)<br><br>—doctorlit now links <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VXIEA_U2QY">this</a> to lighten the mood.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m no extinct animal zoologist person... thing, but a lot of the biology in that travesty looked really bad.

            <p>Also, speaking as a former biology major and as a person generally still fairly interested in such matters, I can concur with doctorlic&#39;s assessement about the improbability of the existence of sexual organs such as  vaginas in dinosaurs. Birds and most reptiles posesses something called cloaca, which basically is a orifice where urine, excrement and sexual gametes all come out throught.<br><br> As both of the groups would be descended from dinosaurs, it is highly unlikely indeed that a female dinosaur would a vagina or even that a male would have a penis. Well maybe a male since reptiles such as snakes do have what is called a hemi-penis that comes out of a orifice, but denifitely not a female having a vagina, no sir</p>

Which is quite sad, really, seeing as I genuinely feel that she&#39;d be capable of better if only she did her darn research and actually wrote believable characters and relationships. Truth be told, I did actually feel some appreciation for the way she wrote back then, and I didn&#39;t realize how creepy and abusive the main pairing really was until long after the fact.<br><br>I haven&#39;t read the genderbent version myself, but if the Internet&#39;s reaction is correct, I don’t think I’ll be missing much. Genderbent shenanigans need to consider the differences in how society treats males and females, so simply changing the names and gender pronouns sounds truly creative. <br><br>Now, how soon will it be before we get a genderswap of <i>Fifty Shades of Gray</i>? ;n;</p>

            <p>You see, it&#39;s the law of diminishing returns. Twilight is on its own pretty bad, which tends to drop the quality of Twilight fanfiction. Now it would seem to make things worse, there&#39;s about to be a rewritten version of the original story, which admittedly may surprise us and turn out good, but as is more usually the case will actually be wise than the original spawning even lower quality fan fiction.</p>

            <p>Basically, Reinforce Eins was seen in the series only for a little amount of time before sacrificing herself, and for all that time she was wearing a typical Barrier Jacket-like outfit.<br><br>The main premise of the PSP game is her surviving instead, so we see her in normal clothing. And, considering how Seven Arcs is  <i>very</i> fond of fanservice and Reinforce Eins is pretty busty, everyone was surpised when she appeared wearing a very modest sweater.</p>

            <p>I would honestly be lying if I said that the Twilight series wasn&#39;t totally self-indulgent trash for me. Is it awful? Oh, my god, absolutely. But its terrible makes it that much more fun to read. Especially since they&#39;re not exactly complex; I remember powering through pretty much the whole series in a day or two, it was quite relaxing to not have to think. :P<br><br>Though honestly, I&#39;m more mad that it&#39;s a genderbend instead of a role swap. I might actually be genuinely intrigued in a moody broody terrible vampire Bella and a mopey human Edward. </p>

            <p>Not familiar with his work, but - yeah - I know the feeling.  When you&#39;ve been following any long-running book series, there comes a point when you realise that the author is no longer interested in the series from a creative/artistic way, and is now just churning them out for the money.<br><br>Unless you&#39;re a compulsive completist, that&#39;s usually the time to give up and move on to something different instead.<br></p>

            <p>I mean, you&#39;re making like three fairly obvious SPaG errors in one sentence - the sentence in which you *offer your services as a SPaG beta*.

            <p>My thoughts follow:<br><br><u>AGENTS</u><br>Aiko seems to be a fairly good start for a character. Her personality seems like it would make for many good prompts. I do have a few canonical concerns, however. If she spent 10 years in the Nursery before becoming an agent, that means she would have been found in 1995. A cursory Internet search tells me that <i>Digimon</i> technically did not exist until 1999 (or 1997 if you want to count the original toys). There&#39;s also the PPC canon issue. If she joined the PPC so early (even as a kid), she would have been through some of the biggest events in PPC history (such as the Reorganization). That&#39;s something that needs to be considered when suggesting such an early recruitment. Relatedly, I&#39;m assuming that Anju is a character you want to bring in later? While there&#39;s nothing that strictly forbids using a non-canonical species amalgam, I&#39;m a little iffy on the concept. <br><br>Henry seems all right, but I feel like there&#39;s a possible contradiction between &quot;very blunt&quot; and &quot;restrained around sensitive people.&quot; I would emphasize his propensity for verbal gaffes to have that make more sense.<br><br><u>PROMPTS</u><br>I noticed a scattering of technical errors (such as on the first page, second paragraph: &quot;It seemed to even more confusing...&quot; There is a missing &quot;be&quot; after the to.) Some of the paragraphs and sentences were awkwardly constructed, such as this one:<br><br><i>He realized his mistake when Anju glared at him and Aiko’s eyes got big and shiny. “What?! No! You don’t even know me! How can you say something like that?”</i><br><br>A character&#39;s speech and actions should be connected. The preceding paragraph makes it sound as if Henry was the one talking rather than Aiko. Everything also seemed a bit stilted, which possibly ties into the previously mentioned awkward constructions.<br><br>As for the stories themselves, they worked fairly well. I like the interactions between Aiko and Anju. Aiko&#39;s consideration nature was very well displayed in her get to Henry.<br><br><u>BADFIC</u><br>Yeah, that works for PPC purposes.<br><br>Unfortunately, I&#39;m going to have to say that your permission request is denied. Your writing needs a bit more polish before I&#39;d be comfortable giving you the final thumbs up. You should also consider going back and tweaking Aiko&#39;s backstory to fit both <i>Digimon</i> and the PPC. If you have any questions or concerns, please let me know. I&#39;m more than willing to help.<br><br>PC</p>

            <p>First of all: 1995 was <i>twenty years ago</i>? Stars and water! Where did the time go? :-/<br><br>On-topic: I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a problem with backdating an agent&#39;s recruitment, even by a long time. Most - to be honest, I think all - of my agents are backdated from their introduction, in some cases a loooong way. &#39;Oldbie + newbie&#39; is a fairly classic agent setup.<br><br>That said, it does mean paying attention to what the PPC was like back then. If your agent was here before 2006, they lived through Crashing Down. If they were here before 2008, they were there for the macrovirus epidemic. If they were there before 2013, they were around when the Blackout cut HQ into chunks and meatloaf roamed the corridors. Heck, if they were around before last month, they know what it&#39;s like to be randomly moved into someone else&#39;s body. There&#39;s always things to consider.<br><br>Anju: Badfic refugees come in a lot of unnatural kinds. We have a telepathic horse, an evil(er) Son of Feanor, a Phantom of the Pernese Opera, several goddesses... I don&#39;t think &#39;uncanonical Digimon&#39; (or whatever) is terribly out of place. ^_~<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Also, re:agent dating, I personally feel that your own creative history can also make a useful reference if you plan to conscript characters you already created prior to joining the Board, especially when it comes to salvaging creations who would otherwise have been abandoned. The earliest time that any of my agents would have arrived was likely 2013, given how Lapis stayed in HQ for two years prior to starting her agent career, though knowing Rashida, Tianlong, and how I retired from DeviantArt and active badfic creation in late 2012, it&#39;s possible that they may have started trickling in a bit earlier. So I suppose a few of them may have likely experienced the Blackout, but given how I wasn&#39;t there to see the RP, there wouldn&#39;t have been Ant major involvement on their part. I also didn&#39;t feel confident in handling any previous major events, so it&#39;s likely that they arrived after them. <br><br>Also, I can help out with SPaG and character refining if you like! My address is skarmorysilver (at) Gmail (dot) com, substituting punctuation as appropriate.</p>

            <p>Let that be a lesson to everyone: never try to do math at the end of a long day. Yes, it would be 2005.

I was active in commenting for a while, then slowly phased out to just reading and keeping up, and I&#39;ve only really started posting again in the past few weeks. <br><br>So my question is, unsurprisingly, when is it acceptable for me to bite the bullet and put in a permission request? <br><br>(Related side note: I&#39;ve had a permission request floating around my google drive for a few months now and would love a beta reader to give it a once over!)</p>

            <p>So, how do you begin thing like that? Say that you need time to think things through? No, I had that already... Apologize for what you did wrong? Nah, did that too... Well then, I have nothing clever to begin this with.<br><br>I&#39;m leaving. Maybe for a long hiatus, maybe (most likely) forever. The point is - I messed up, I did something really, <i>really</i> bad. I&#39;ve hurt one person I never wanted to hurt. I thought I would be able to work things out, and eventually everything would turn out to be good. Apparently, it didn&#39;t. For the last week I felt broken, I felt alienated, untouchable. Like I was carrying leprosy. I had two great people talking to me at that time, helping me, telling me to be patient... but I don&#39;t think it did a lot, plus I don&#39;t want to bother them anymore.<br><br>When I discovered the PPC, the last thing I wanted is to make enemies. Well, six months in and I made two - one was my fault, the other decided to condemn me for entirely different reasons, which they decided to never share with me. Is it fair, I don&#39;t know. Maybe it&#39;s normal to shun people like that. As it was revealed, I don&#39;t understand people and I completely lack common sense. I would like those two people to not to indicate that it&#39;s them - last thing I want to leave behind is a morality war. Turns out you can&#39;t be everyone&#39;s friend, even if you try. <br><br>That being said, I have one more apology to the victim of this whole incident - it&#39;s my fault, and I don&#39;t deserve any mercy from you. And on that note I will finish. To anyone with higher power in the wiki - do whatever you wish with my Agents. Kill them, delete them, they&#39;re fair game from now on. <br><br>Any joke for the end? Any funny jest to make myself remembered?<br><br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br><br>No.<br><br><img src="http://img2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20120726100552/charmed/images/9/90/5x10_Sand_Teleportation_2.gif"></p>

            <p>Farewell is reserved for the end of the story, and a story can only have one end...<br><br>Seeing the way you updated Venus&#39; and William&#39;s profiles, this hiatus is something serious, and you clearly think that this is the thing you must do now. However, let&#39;s me toss my two cents on this matter.<br><br>You said you hurt some people. I don&#39;t know who are these people, so excuse me for intruding, but I think that misunderstandings are unavoidable when you&#39;re part of a community, because we&#39;re all living people, who have emotions we don&#39;t always control, emotions who can lead us to hurt people in the heat of the moment. It&#39;s not a good thing by any stretch of imagination alright, but that&#39;s part of being together with other peoples, you cannot make no mistakes in life, because that would mean you do nothing otherwise, and that would be wasting life that spending it locked up in his room. Like a great man said through his character, you would just end up like Mrs Havisham, tormenting some Pip in an attempt for making up this mistake.<br><br>Peoples know they aren&#39;t insane when they can doubt about their sanity. Peoples know when they&#39;re wrong, and then can change for the better, when they know something went wrong.<br><br>I cannot really be talking about lessons here, being a newbie and being part of an internet community for the first time, but I think that leaving forever would be a tragic mistake. Take some time thinking about this, makes peace with yourself and to these peoples you wronged. Apologies exist for this very reason.<br><br>Takes the time you need for sorting this matter, but I&#39;m sure I can&#39;t be the only one who will be waiting for you to return.<br><br>Once again, goodbye, but NEVER farewell.<br><br>Hardric</p>

            <p>By the way, the issue was truly horrendous FPS stutter. Looks like microstutter, except that&#39;s a multi-GPU specific issue. Anyways, near as I can tell, there&#39;s no fix. I ended up wiping my system. However, it does seem to be tied to a specific file (Likely a driver) so you can do a system restore with little fear. An easy way to tell if it&#39;s the same issue I had (At least on Windows 7) is if you mouse over your desktop icons and when they do the background-fade-in thingy, they will stutter and hang up if you mouse over them fast enough.</p>
