            <p>Since we&#39;ve had a bunch of people join since the last thread, I thought I&#39;d ask: where&#39;d you get your handle from? Did you invent it yourself? Did you name it after something?<br><br>I&#39;ll start with mine: &#39;Desdendelle&#39; comes from <a href="http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Des_Dendle">Des Dendle</a>, which is a horrid <i>Yu-Gi-Oh!</i> card nobody in their right mind would use. I saw the name quite sometime around 2008 and decided I liked it; I&#39;ve been using the handle in various places around the Internet since then.</p>

            <p>The basic premise is that there&#39;s a world that mirrors ours, called The Realm, and travel between the two is possible but rare. Each human has a Glimpse twin (a Glimpse is basically a human, but they all have ghost-white skin and their eyes flash different colors depending on their ultimate loyalty) that can be a different age but is physically identical and dies at the same time. It&#39;s a great trilogy, and the audiobooks are wonderful. <br><br>An Alleb is a Glimpse from the city of Alleble, and my full name is Alleb Knight, meaning (duh) that I&#39;m a knight of Alleble. In <i>The Door Within</i>, it basically means you&#39;re a Christian (although this universe has some really interesting doctrinal differences that I&#39;ve only recently begun to notice). But anyway, that&#39;s a super long backstory to my name. <sup>_<sup><br><br>-Alleb</sup></sup></p>

            <p>Well &quot;Cattomboy&quot; is actually a shortened verison of a super long username I had on gaia back when I was 13. The name is meant to read &quot;Cat tomboy&quot; i.e. relating to cats and the tomboy stereotype,but more often it ends up being read as &quot;Cat tom boy&quot; and people just assume I&#39;m a guy. <br><br>&quot;Jebboy&quot; is just the name of one of my old cats my parents had when I was a little girl. </p>

            <p>I remember this topic being discussed a while back, yet I don&#39;t recall reaching any sort of agreement about it, so I&#39;m going to propose something:<br><br>As we all know, it is not good for the canon characters to know about the PPC, yet it happens from time to time. In order to avoid random characters discovering the Organization (I remember seeing Xena the Warrior Princess one time on the list), I feel like there should be some requirements for a canon character. This is my version:<br><br><u>1. Omnipotent characters</u><br>This basically restricts this category to any sort of God/Creator figure of the universe: Eru, The Presence, The-One-Above-All, Aslan, etc. A character that is able to do absolutely anything, with no restriction, naturally has to know that their universe is being disturbed and there is someone there fixing it.<br><br><u>2. Omniscient characters</u><br>Characters who know everything that&#39;s happening in the world. This usually goes together with the first category, but sometimes omniscience is its own thing.<br><br><u>3. 4th Wall Breakers</u><br>Simply put, a character aware that their Universe is false. The most prominent example here is Deadpool.<br><br><u>4. Characters immune to neuralyzers...</u><br>Or any other form of mental manipulation.</p>

            <p>One canon that knows about us is The Puppet from FNaF, on the basis that it has power over life and death. Seeing as Death itself and its various avatars know about us, the Puppet was given the same honor. (Probably due to the fact that aside from being able to stuff spirits into animal suits, we have no clue what the Puppet is capable of, so he&#39;s put there just in case. At least, that&#39;s my theory.)<br><br>Another one would most likely be Hermaeus Mor from Skyrim. Seeing as he&#39;s the daedric lord of knowledge and memory, I doubt neuralyzers will affect him.<br><br>Also, the Outsider from Dishonered may qualify as well: given that he&#39;s said to be all-powerful on many, many occasions in the game, he definitely fits.</p>

            <p>I do believe they should be more special then your regular canon character. After all, the knowledge of the fact they are in a fictional story is important. However, this does not mean they should be aware of the PPC. So, what to do? I say, make them able to see agents, but not know who they are. Canon helps to cloak the agents from the average canon character, unless they make themselves known. However, because of the interesting nature of fourth-wall breakers, this cloak fails to hide the agents from those who can already see far more then they should.<br><br>What does this mean? That Deadpool will always harass any agent in the Marvel cannon? Well, no. He likely would not care about them. And not because of the SEP field (which I am on record for thinking as cheating, and am not a fan of their usage in missions) but because, well, why would he? Does he interact with literally every single person milling about the local block? Well, sometimes, but that&#39;s besides the point. Unless the agents are in a conspicuous location that he is clearing out, say something that would be funny of he were to interject, or otherwise draw his attention, he&#39;s likely to notice them and just move on. Why do you think agents have disguises? Here you go.<br><br>What does this change? Unless the author wants it to, not much. It opens up an avenue for character interaction and agent danger, while not necessitating a interaction if the mission writer does not want to be bothered.<br><br>The one exception to this (that I can think of) is Pinkie Pie. Not that she should know about the PPC, mind you, but that she would force an interaction on you if you are in Ponyville. She knows everypony in town. <i>Everypony.</i> And if you&#39;re new in town, she will make sure to give you a big welcome. And yes, this would include folks under SEP fields. New ponies in town <i>are</i> her problem. Always. How can you justify not having a surprise party forced on your agents every time they enter Ponyville? Well, for one, have the agents be careful. Two, she may not fully recognize them, but something tells her that it would be a really bad idea if she were to bother the new ponies right now. She may leave a small gift for them instead. Third, there is something very familiar about return agents...<br><br>Just my thoughts. It makes fourth wall characters a little more interesting, without making PPC knowledge a badge of being *specul*.</p>

            <p>Expanding on your list regarding Desdendelle’s rule of thumbs:<br><br>4. Character’s who cannot made forget should never be told about the PPC, nor should they ever be allowed to watch something suspicious that makes them wanting to investigate, so that they may learn about the PPC on their own – unless, of course, there is a really very good in-mission reason why the agents couldn’t avoid doing so.<br><br>3. 4th Wall Breakers  who know about the PPC should be neuralyzed. Being aware that their universe isn’t everything still doesn’t mean that they should know everything about the multiverse. If they cannot be neuralyzed, see Nr. 4.<br><br>2. Canonically omniscient beings certainly know about the PPC, but if they aren’t also canonically known of paying attention and micro-managing every detail of their world, there may still be no really good in-mission reason why they should remember and act on this knowledge – unless they are provoked by the agents intentionally interacting whit them for a really good reason.<br><br>1. Omnipotent characters not also being omniscient are covered by Nr. 4. Since they can do whatever they want to do, they can get true answers to all their questions and they can avoid being made forget. Learning about the PPC on their own, not knowing in advance what they are looking for and where they should start looking for it, may still need an infinite amount of time; so it can easily be assumed that they did not achieve this yet. <br><br>HG</p>

            <p>The following points include mild spoilers/speculatons about the Dresden Files and Persona. You have been warned.<br><br>For characters indoubtly in the know about PPC inside the DFs, there is one I would like to have an opinion about, The Archive, Ivy during the main series. <br><br>The Archive is a woman who holds inside her mind a perfect copy of any information ever written, plus the memories of the preceding Archives, and who in the past, could play the Pythie of Delph thanks to this knowledge. <br><br>I think she would be in the know because anything written means the charges lists. Now, you could say &quot;Don&#39;t write anything then.&quot;, and you&#39;re right (It&#39;s even the 1488th thing not allowed to do inside PPC.). Te catch? It also means the canon material necessary to exorcisms, and once even one book is brought inside this world, she would know about this (And with the slash you can find about Dresden and mafioso Marcone, you bet that exorcisms are in sore need here.) . Now, the Archive can &#39;delete&#39; an information from her mind once it&#39;s the only place where it&#39;s left, but couldn&#39;t she keeping PPC awareness from this experience?<br><br>My other question isn&#39;t about canons in the knows, but who could be able to see through SEP Fields and would know if they&#39;re faced with a glitterbag: Igor and the Velvet Room attendants inside said Velvet Room.<br><br>Gameplay-wise it&#39;s a hub where you can fuse new Personae, check Social Links progress... Lorewise, it&#39;s a construct inside the Collective Unconscious, manned by Igor, servant of Philemon, supposed to be the embodiement of any good inside mankind (check Jung for more information), and the attendants, other beings from this other world.<br><br>Now, the VR is a place who, judging from the implications in-game, exists within the main of the Persona Users linked to Philemon (Persona 1 and 2), or whoever inherited the Wild Card power and passed a &#39;contract&#39; with Philemon (Persona 3 and 4, for now.).<br><br>Now, they also seem to know anyhing about the people(s) linked to the Velvet Room, so the intrusion of a glitterbag would rise their eyebrows. Not only that, but they also say something without a complete psyche cannot enter the VR, and they&#39;re aware of the mind of any person entering, and since glitterbags were always stated to be less than complete on that matter, they&#39;ll see them as something closer to Shadows than anything else.<br><br>Now, it doesn&#39;t mean PPC knowledge, but in my opinion, it means no SEP Fields inside this room, and necessity to neuralize Igor and the attendants every single time. Am I right?<br><br>Last note, what&#39;s would be your opinions about the &#39;gods&#39; inside the Collective Unconscious, beings like Philemon, no actual gods, but enbodiement of some type of thoughts from mankind, like grief, desire to die...</p>

            <p>Hey, remember last January, when I did the first ever PPC New Years&#39; Gift Exchange? I think it&#39;s about time that we do it again!<br><br>The original post for the 2015 Gift Exchange can be found <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=266767;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">here</a>, including the rules both for admission and how to play. This time around, though, I&#39;m thinking of a few change-ups as far as rules are concerned.<br><br>For one thing, since I&#39;m moving early this month, I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;ll have the time to moderate this event by myself, so I was wondering if someone else could volunteer to co-host this event with me this year (in-universe, that means two agents co-host the event - one to moderate the shenanigans and one to keep track of the gift transfer). I&#39;ll still contribute by maintaining the spreadsheet that has all the gifts sent in, the number order, and records of who ultimately gets what. If any of you have agents who are willing to volunteer, let me know in a reply to this post!<br><br>As for the general rules for this event, they are as follows, copypasted (mostly) from the 2015 Gift Exchange setup post:<br><br>ADMISSION AND SETUP:<br>1. You need to have Permission and at least two agents to enter this event.<br>2. In a reply to this post, list each of your attending agent teams and one gift for each team member to bring. This may be either a &quot;souvenir&quot; from a mission you&#39;ve published previously, or just something they happen to have that they want to give away.<br>3. I will take four or five other Boarders for this year&#39;s event, so the first five Boarders to submit applications will be the ones attending it.<br><b>NEW ADDENDUM FOR 2016: Since this event went over so well last year, I&#39;ll bump up the number of attending Boarders to six or seven. Additionally, if you have multiple agent teams active, any one of them can participate.</b><br>4. For future events like this, anyone with Permission can host this event. One of their agents must serve as an in-universe host for this event; any other agents in the host&#39;s team are to participate as players.<br><br>EVENT RULES:<br>5. I will set up an introductory post on the Message Board for this event, with a full guest list for all attending. The most important rule: <b>NOBODY MUST KNOW WHAT THE GIFTS ARE UNTIL THEY&#39;VE OPENED THEM.</b> Surprise is the driving factor here! This means that all of the gifts are wrapped and put in a big pile at the start of the game.<br>6. Once I&#39;ve tallied the full list, each player will get a random number, with the range depending on how many players there are. The agents must play in that order via replies to the starting post.<br>7. The agent currently in play can either choose a gift from the pile (I&#39;ll provide the full list of gifts on the Posting Board) or, if others before them have already chosen gifts, they can &quot;steal&quot; a gift from the previous owner. A gift can be stolen up to twice; after that, it is locked to the agent it&#39;s ended up with, and cannot be stolen again.<br><b>NEW ADDENDUM FOR 2016: If a gift is stolen from any agent, THEY CANNOT STEAL IT BACK. This was actually a bit of a contention point in the Real-Life gift exchange I attended yesterday evening, so I thought I&#39;d make it clear as day for this one!</b><br>8. The game ends once everyone has received a gift. Since the first agent cannot steal, he/she will be given the choice to steal after this. The host cannot steal.<br><br>That should be it, I think. Let&#39;s get things rolling once more, everyone!</p>

            <p>Three agents for you:<br><br>Gaspard will be bringing a dozen of his home-made chocolate йclairs-- made using his baker great-grandfather&#39;s recipe.<br><br>Harris will be bringing... a thing. He&#39;s not entirely sure what it is, but it purrs, it coos, it&#39;s fluffy, it loves eating, and it seems to mysteriously multiply itself in a very short period of time. A Trekkie agent will immediately recognize it as a <a href="http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Tribble">tribble</a> but Harris is neither a Trekkie or particularly observant.<br><br>The Guardsman will be giving away some firepower in the form of a pre-patch R8 revolver, from <i>Counter-Strike: Global Offensive</i>. Before Valve obliterated the R8 with the nerf bat, it boasted near-perfect accuracy, did as much damage as the AWP sniper rifle (which is a one-shot kill to anywhere but the legs), and plunged the game into a dark age of the wild, wild west for three days straight as everyone used the revolver since nobody in their right mind would use a regular gun only to be one-shotted by a 850$ sidearm. <br><br>He thinks it&#39;s funny. <br></p>

            <p>I got a load of shirts and books and things (my Christmas tree was <i>made of books</i>), but what really made it was my girlfriend getting me an embroidered, ridiculously soft stuffed tiger and rhino. Their names are, in my usual imaginative vein, Tiger and Rhino, or occasionally Striped Friend and Pointy Friend.<br><br>Stuffed animals are good. They&#39;re friends when you&#39;re too young to really know what friends <i>are</i>. They&#39;re there, and they never stop being there, even after they&#39;ve all but disintegrated from years of snuggles. I adore them. I&#39;ve lost a lot over the years due to my parents thinking I&#39;d outgrown them (At twenty-three, you say? What a preposterous notion), but I remember them. Big Bear, an enormous polar bear I&#39;m willing to swear blind I learned to read while sitting in; Rooball, a kangaroo who could fold up inside a soft felt rugby ball; Mister Octomapus, who is still up in my nana&#39;s house safe from parental depredations; Duck, who was a big fluffy mallard duck; Steggle, the green and white striped stegosaurus whose species name I insisted on pronouncing stegglesaurus until... well, frankly I still do it sometimes when in a whimsical mood; Professor Wol, who has emerged from his hiding place behind a filing cabinet and is sitting next to me.<br><br>But you had a favourite. You always had a favourite. Wombat was mine. He was my Wombat. He still is. He&#39;s... he&#39;s staying with my girlfriend now because it&#39;s not a safe environment for stuffed animals at my parents&#39; house. And he&#39;s old, and his fur is slowly leaving him, and he&#39;s missing an eye from when I was playing with him at my uncle&#39;s house and he slipped out of my hands and bounced around on a stone floor. And he&#39;s my favourite, because he&#39;s mine, and he&#39;s been mine since I was less than two years old, and I remember my mother telling me bedtime stories of him being a Gallifreyan Time Lord who went on adventures in the back of the black sofa we had in our living room.<br><br>He&#39;s my friend and I love him, and it&#39;s probably pathetic but it&#39;s background information for why the introduction of Striped Friend and Pointy Friend left me crying with happiness. Because that&#39;s what you should have at Christmas, and all the rest of the year too.<br><br>Something soft and safe and precious you can hold when the world&#39;s too much for you to take.</p>

            <p>But first, a very special announcement... I&#39;m relocating early next month! Specifically, to Chevy Chase, Maryland, which is literally next door to Washington, D.C. I&#39;m still working on the specifics for clearance and stuff, but long story short, I&#39;ll be working as a software engineer at my new place if things go as planned. Which means I&#39;ll have, uh, a little less time for mission-writing than I used to, but the difference will be fairly minimal if I can keep my job for like what, six months? Talons crossed, I suppose.<br><br>With that being said, on behalf of Cupid, Sarah, and one disgruntled Monado-toting assassin, I hope you enjoy <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YEJvvUPhMgwpZy1sNaXB9uadnwJm7q5vwZNjkfOp0oI/edit?usp=sharing">&quot;The Gods Must Be Crazy&quot;</a>!</p>

            <p>Good mission. We haven&#39;t see a good old LOTR Sue in a while. (How old was this one? I hope that these things aren&#39;t <i>still</i> being written after all these years?!)<br><br>However, there are quite a few errors.<br><br>First of all, formatting. Partway in, the text color changes to gray and never turns back.<br><br>As for the story itself:<br>1) <i>After <b>thwarting of</b> a surprise attack from Aragorn,</i><br><br>A rare double error. First, misspelling: That &quot;of&quot; is obviously supposed to be &quot;off&quot;. Secondly, misuse: &quot;thwart&quot; is not followed by &quot;off&quot;. The verb should just be &quot;thwarting&quot; -- no &quot;off&quot; -- or else a verb phrase that ends in &quot;off,&quot; such as &quot;fending off&quot;.<br><br>2) <i>the Mini <b>melon</b> was born</i><br>As minis are created by misspelled <i>names</i>, &quot;melon&quot; shouldn&#39;t be a mini.<br><br>3) <i>changing POVS without warning</i><br>It should be &quot;POVs&quot;(note the lowercase S), or better yet, spelled out as &quot;points of view&quot;. As currently written, the &quot;S&quot; is part of the acronym.<br><br>4) <i>Za’kiir deactivated the tool and looked across the lake at the characters. “It worked, thank Alkosh. Their eyes are distant, but canon will resume in a moment.”</i><br><br>By &quot;tool,&quot; I am guessing you mean the neuralyzer? If so, then that clause is unneeded. Unless I&#39;m misunderstanding something or Za&#39;kiir somehow turned the neuralyzer into a flashlight, there is no need for him to &quot;deactivate&quot; it once the flash has come and gone.</p>

            <p>For the Dummy, I get it now, it&#39;s just after using it in the precedent missions, then ditching it so quickly... Maybe writing about Zakiir taking it anyway, for precaution, and showing that it was not needed would have worked better?

            <p>I love how it&#39;s a surreal experience even by PPC standards. Which is saying something, really. This is a lovely interlude to have read and thank both of you for sharing. c: I&#39;ve been out of the loop, and I don&#39;t know if there&#39;s history with Algie, but he&#39;s dearly entertaining and it&#39;s also excellent to see Library again. She always takes things in such stride.<br><br>additional: I am continually in awe of Philomene&#39;s matter-of-factness and cool-headedness in the face of everything. I am not surprised she is related to our Library. <br><br>And overall I enjoyed reading both of these very much! Happy Christmas.<br><br>(Socks are actually amazing Christmas presents &gt;.&gt;)</p>

            <p>Well, it&#39;s still Christmas Eve for me, but whatever!<br><br>Also, I&#39;m back! Sorry for being inactive these last several months. School and personal life got very hectic, and I could not get on the board much. However, I think I want to see if I can slam out a few stories relatively quickly. I have no idea what my life will be like later, so I may well disappear again. But, for now, I&#39;m here. And itching to get some missions done. Or, at least, some short stories.<br><br>To not make this a completely useless thread, I&#39;ll open this up to be a general gift-giving, well wishes thread. Give gifts to all the boarders and agents you love, or even just wish everyone merry. I&#39;m sure you all have something to give, even if it&#39;s not technically real.</p>

            <p>It&#39;s been a relatively miserable day, but only because my computer/space heater (I&#39;m not joking; that&#39;s part of what I use it for) decided to boot from the wrong device, and didn&#39;t want me to fix it. Other than the temperature, it&#39;s been pretty good. Anything new with you guys?</p>

            <p>Butter-Sugar cookies!<br>1 cup unsalted butter<br><br>1 cup granulated sugar<br><br>1 large egg<br><br>1 teaspoon baking power<br><br>2 teaspoons vanilla extract<br><br>3 cups all-purpose flour<br><br>GLAZE<br><br>1 lb confectioners sugar<br><br>3/4 cup milk (originally 1/2 cup milk)<br><br>1/4 cup agave nectar (originally 1/2 cup light corn syrup)<br><br>1 teaspoon vanilla extract<br><br>Food coloring as desired<br><br>DIRECTIONS<br><br>1. Preheat oven to 350 F<br><br>2. Cream butter and sugar for two minutes. Stop and scrape the bowl, before creaming an additional minute.<br><br>3. Beat in egg and vanilla until well combined<br><br>4. Sift together baking powder and flour. Add the mixture a cup at a time to the creamed butter and sugar mix. Blend in the last cup of flour by hand, as the dough is stiff.<br><br>5. Divide dough into two balls. Wrap in plastic wrap and put in the refrigerator for at least an hour.<br><br>6. Roll out one ball of dough between two sheets of parchment paper to ~ 1/4 inch thick. Remove top pece of parchment, and run a spatula under to loosen.<br><br>7. Cut cookies. Dip in flour before each use.<br><br>8. Place cut cookies onto cookie sheets with parchment paper on.<br><br>9. Bake for 8-10 minutes or untill they just start to brown. Let the cookies rest for 5-10 minutes before moving to cooling rack. Cool completely before applying glaze.<br><br>FOR GLAZE<br><br>1. Thoroughly mix sugar and milk. The mixture should be soft and have a heavy cream texture.<br><br>2. Add Agave (or corn syrup) and mix until combined.<br><br>3. Add extract and food coloring, if using it.<br><br>4. When ready, brush glaze on the cookies with a small pastry brush, applying a thin layer of glaze. When the tops of the cookies are completely painted, place back on cooling racks to dry.<br><br>They can be consume at any time, even before dry. However, if you want a dry glaze, leave them overnight.<br><br>And, there you have it.</p>

            <p>We&#39;ll have to chat some time. I seem to have missed some things while I was gone. We should especially talk about that mission we were thinking about doing. You know the one.<br><br>Oh, cookies! I hope they were good. Sounds like it, if you ate so many. I&#39;ve made quite a few pies. I&#39;ll throw that in to the feast.<br><br>You know what? I want to give the agents some love.<br><br>For Zeb, a box of Lion Lickers. I feel the lad needs something sweet.<br><br>For the Aviator, Marvin and Printworthy worked really hard on a replica Ollivander&#39;s brand wand. With Printworthy&#39;s hair for a core! (They don&#39;t think it does anything, but it&#39;s the thought that counts.)<br><br>Jumper, on the other hand, has more... Interesting gifts. To Zeb, he wants to give a black flute. Attached to the stem is a tag. It reads: <i>We All Need Space Sometimes</i> in golden script. To The Aviator, he wants to give an antique globe of the Earth, with <i>For Rina Dives; Remember Where You&#39;re From</i> engraved on it. However, I&#39;m holding onto it, for now. I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s wise to give that.<br><br>He also gives Kalen a gift. A bottle of <a href="http://elderscrolls.wikia.com/wiki/Daedric_Lava_Whiskey">Daedric Lava Whiskey</a> with a pixie-shot glass on the top, and a note taped to the front. It reads: <i>Drink With Extreme Caution. <b><u>DO NOT DRINK IN HQ</u></b> Save Some For Extreme Emergency</i></p>

            <p>(I&#39;ve got a Christmassey RWBY mission in the works that I hope to finish today, so have an alternate-ish ending to that, which might or might not end up being canon.)<br><br>The Aviator and Zeb portaled back to their response center, both soaked to the skin and shivering like mad.<br><br>Alex jumped up from the sofa in alarm, which caused Zeke to screech. &quot;What happened to you guys?&quot;<br><br>&quot;You don&#39;t. Want. To know,&quot; the Aviator said grumpily, going over to the kitchenette and retrieving a bottle of Spirytus from the cupboard. She all but ripped the lid off and took a large gulp.<br><br>Zeb shook himself, sending water flying everywhere; Alex brought up his arms to shield his face just in time. &quot;Oops. Sorry. But, er, yeah. You really don&#39;t want to know.&quot;<br><br>Alex gingerly, but sympathetically, patted Zeb on the head. &quot;Oh, while you guys were gone, a couple of agents from the APD dropped by with presents,&quot; he said, nodding toward the still-undecorated tree. Three presents were set underneath it. &quot;A guy named Marvin and, uh, somepony named Printworthy.&quot;<br><br>The Aviator, who had drained half the bottle by now, looked up, her eyes went wide. &quot;S***, I didn&#39;t even think about getting anyone <i>presents!</i>&quot;<br><br>&quot;It&#39;s okay, we&#39;ve still got plenty of time to think of some,&quot; Zeb said, eyeing the bottle. &quot;Er, don&#39;t you think you&#39;ve had enough? Maybe you should stop.&quot;<br><br>&quot;No, I shan&#39;t, it&#39;s Christmas,&quot; the Aviator said, taking another gulp.<br><br>Zeb grimaced and turned back to Alex. &quot;Thanks for letting us know.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Hey, it was no problem,&quot; Alex said, holding out his arm so Zeke could land on his shoulder. &quot;I think they&#39;d like it if you guys visited sometime, you haven&#39;t seen them in--&quot;<br><br>&quot;Four hundred and thirty-five years,&quot; the Aviator interrupted, setting down the now-empty bottle on the counter with a <i>thud</i>. <br><br>&quot;...Actually, I was going to say &#39;A few weeks&#39;,&quot; Alex said, frowning at her. &quot;Marvin mentioned doing a mission of some sort.&quot;<br><br>The Aviator shrugged and shuffled over to the bathroom, leaving a trail of seawater behind her. &quot;I&#39;m gonna get a shower,&quot; she said. &quot;You guys can decorate without me.&quot; With that, she dissappered into the bathroom and slammed the door behind her. <br><br>Zeb sighed and turned away from the door, his ears drooping. They perked back up when he caught sight of the tree in the corner. &quot;So,&quot; he said, &quot;decorating?&quot;<br><br>Alex grinned. &quot;Let&#39;s get started.&quot;<br><br></p>

            <p>So, since today&#39;s Christmas Eve, or a regular Thursday to some people, and a lot of Boarders are from different countires, I&#39;ve been wondering: What is common for you to do around this time of year? I&#39;m asking all the holiday customs and traditions mostly but hey, if you don&#39;t celebrate anything just let us know what you&#39;re gonna do today! :D<br><br>I&#39;ll start:<br><br>Well, the first difference that I can think of is, because Poland is 95% Roman Catholic, there&#39;s fish instead of turkey as a main Christmas dinner meal. Usually, there&#39;s also 12 dishes - which are meant to grant you good luck next year, if you try all of them.<br><br>But there is one custom which I believe is unique to Poland, and maybe Lithuania (or Italy, too... Sergio, care to confirm or deny?). Right before the big Christmas dinner, the eldest member of the family gets a specially baked wafer - an oblat - and breaks it into smaller pieces. Then, everyone takes a piece and exchanges wishes with the rest of the family, eating a small chunk of the oblat for every wish they make or receive.</p>

            <p>First off, for every Christmas my family has the same special breakfast: egg San Francisco. It&#39;s a combination of eggs, bacon, angel hair pasta, and Hollandaise. Trust me, it is far better than it sounds. But probably just as unhealthy as it sounds, as well.<br><br>There is also the movie tradition. My family watches multiple holiday films during the run up to Christmas, ranging from classics like <i>White Christmas</i> to slightly more modern fare like <i>The Grinch Who Stole Christmas</i>. It all caps off with <i>National Lampoon&#39;s Christmas Vacation</i> on Christmas Day itself.<br><br>Some of my family&#39;s traditions have fallen by the wayside due to the inexorable march of time, unfortunately. Cookie baking and stockings have both been allowed to lapse this year. Same with putting up the venerable artificial tree (my folks bought that thing in the 1980s). But that&#39;s how things go, I suppose.</p>

            <p>Singing songs, baking cookies and pie, enjoying each others company. Although, this year, we all admitted to not really being in the holiday spirit. Not that we&#39;re all grumpy or anything. Just sorta... Collectively apathetic. Still, we&#39;re trying, and still enjoying each other, even if it&#39;s not particularly festive.<br><br>Although, thinking on it, I suppose we do have a couple of traditions that are different. Some with a story too.<br><br>The biggest one is actually all my fault. When I was about five or six, I was practically bounding with excitement for Christmas. There were so many presents under the tree that year! Big, tall boxes, full of goodies, surrounded by wrapped books and CD&#39;s (even back then, I was an avid PC gamer. LEGO and Humongous games were the <i>best,</i> man!) Well, and cloths of course. Never liked those. But the <i>toys!</i> I decided, I could not wait a whole eight more hours. I had been patient for over a month! (We don&#39;t play the Santa game, so I had to endure seeing those wrapped goodies since Black Friday.) No, I had to have one, <i>now.</i> I begged my mother. Begged and pleaded. &quot;Just one, mom! Just one present!&quot;<br><br>&quot;No, not until the morning.&quot;<br><br>&quot;But there&#39;s so many! Just one of them, mom! Please!&quot;<br><br>Eventually, she relented. &quot;Fine then. One present.&quot;<br><br>I was about filled to burst with joy! What would it be? A LEGO set? A castle? A robot dragon!? When she came back with the present, I descended upon the poor wrapping paper like it was my personal enemy. And, what was inside?<br><br>A vacuum.<br><br>A small, blue, portable vacuum.<br><br>My heart shattered.<br><br>&quot;Why?&quot;<br><br>My mother laughed. &quot;So you can clean your room easier!&quot;<br><br>&quot;That don&#39;t count! Where&#39;s my <i>real</i> present!&quot;<br><br>I want to quickly defend my character, and insist that this was a particularly greedy year. Usually, I&#39;m happy with whatever I get. Were it Christmas day, I would have probably liked the vacuum. Not loved, but liked. But this was such a letdown, such a blow to my hopes and dreams!<br><br>Rather then chastising me, my mom thought of another idea. &quot;Alright. But no more! This is all you get until morning.&quot;<br><br>She walked back to the tree and looked through the mound of colored paper. At that point, I would have taken just about anything. After the low that is a vacuum, there&#39;s only up, right? When she came back, she held a bulky bundle of paper in her hand. I carefully pealed the paper, cautiously optimistic.<br><br>Inside the second present, was a set of brand new, warm pajamas. While it wasn&#39;t disappointing, it wasn&#39;t exactly thrilling ether. &quot;Thanks, mom,&quot; I said, unable to hide the lingering letdown from my voice.<br><br>Mom pushed the pajamas closer. &quot;Now, while you sleep, you&#39;ll have a warm new pair of jammies. That way, you&#39;ll be nice and warm when you wake up! I want to see you wear them in the morning, OK?  Now, go to bed. I&#39;ll see you in the morning.<br><br>Ever since then, we all get one present on Christmas eve. No, not a vacuum. A brand new par of pajamas and slippers, to wear on Christmas morning.<br><br>Let&#39;s see, what else do we have? Well, Mom&#39;s family used to drive around the city, singing Christmas songs, and looking at the decorations. Sadly, Anchorage has very few people who decorate their houses at all, much less elaborate decorations for neighborhood lights completions. So, that slowly died out, though we still try to find some houses.<br><br>I can&#39;t really think of anything else we do that most others don&#39;t. Still, thinking back on previous years has made me a little more into the spirit of things. This was a nice exercise. Thank you.<br><br>Anyway, merry Christmas to all, have a happy holidays, and a merry new year. </p>

            <p>From what I figure, it is usually on Christmas Day that people go to church.<br><br>Not so with us Haitians; we go to church on Christmas <i>Eve</i>. To be exact, my church usually has a service on Christmas Eve starting from 7:00 PM to around 11:00 PM or 12 midnight. And when we were younger, my little brother and I would head straight for our presents once we arrived home from church, given that it&#39;s technically Christmas Day when we return home from church.</p>

            <p>My church has a Christmas Eve service, although it starts at 5:30 and goes to 6:30. The main attraction is a Christmas story play the children put on. I&#39;ve been in it most years (I recently grew too old for most of the roles, so I didn&#39;t have a part this year) and played an angel (several times), the inkeeper, and Mary.</p>

            <p>My brother and I loved it because we&#39;d fall asleep in the car on the way home and presents would magically appear under the tree sometime between mass and the morning after. :P I used to alter serve for the midnight masses when I got older until one mass when I found out the smell of the incense they used made me faint, so we started going to the children&#39;s mass in the afternoon after that happened.</p>

            <p>So I live in Kentucky which you can imagine is just about as Christian as a state can be. Christmas Eve is a pretty regular day where I live. For people with multiple families to visit, today would be one of those days that would be spent with extended family. The only thing out of the ordinary would be every single store closing about five hours early.<br>For my family, I usually spend Christmas Eve with my mom&#39;s side. We have a brunch with my German grandmother and my mother&#39;s sister. We also usually have a Christmas Eve dinner with my grandmother. So I guess, for me, Christmas Eve is the &quot;Oh God, time to spend time with your cousins&quot; day.</p>

            <p>My family used to identify as Roman Catholic up until a few years ago when I got Confirmed, had an absolutely horrid time of it, and went &quot;**** this I&#39;m outta here&quot; and declared myself agnostic. It just so happened that around the same time, my parents became atheists, and my brother was only going to Sunday Mass so he wouldn&#39;t get grounded. He&#39;s not got a label or anything for himself; he just doesn&#39;t care either way.<br><br>We still enjoy a good bit of holiday cheer and mom&#39;s got a ton of traditional Christmas songs on her iPod for when we&#39;re making cookies, and we put up the tree and everything this year, but we celebrate just a general time of being together with family and friends. So... for us, it&#39;s like Thanksgiving, but with presents and music. And presents. :3<br><br>(And after I counted the ornaments on our tree and found only nine of them weren&#39;t fandom related, I decided to declare December 25 as &quot;The Doctor Saves London From Aliens Yet Again Day&quot;, since we celebrated Regeneration Day on Easter. What can I say, we&#39;re in it for the commercialism.)</p>

            <p>We don&#39;t have Christmas here — Christians are a minority group and a small one at that. Most people celebrate Hanukkah, but DawnFire could probably tell you more about it, since she actually celebrates it (I don&#39;t, I&#39;m irreligious, secular and a bunch of other things). Today and tomorrow are just regular days for me.<br>Though, I did see that the cafй I frequent decorated the bushes they have outside with strings of little lightbulbs, and that cheered me up quite a bit; I spent the next half an hour humming (foreign) holiday tunes.</p>

            <p>However, I consider Christmas a time of tranquility; a time, when you can make amends to your enemies and live through the next year with a slightly lighter conscience.<br><br>Also, Des, Dawn, and everybody - what do you think of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BZi_1dUw2k">[THIS]</a>?

            <p>The bit of Arabic in the beginning is &quot;Allahu Akbar&quot; — Allah is great.

            <p>Agents from continua I don’t know much about disentangling continua I know even less about – that’s not an easy read. But what confused me most is the part with the Simulation Generator. Usually the SimGen is used before the killing happens, so that the simulation is killed when the character has already been taken to a safe place. (NSFW references  <a href="http://www.keldale.f9.co.uk/tabularasa/mission3.htm">here</a> and <a href="http://chelonianmobile.livejournal.com/105076.html">here</a>.) Why do Solvig and Yuuna need a simulation of the dead Kyle Rayner? Would somebody miss the corpse?<br><br>Also, I stumbled over so many missing words and other technical errors that I don’t intend to post the list here.

            <p>...and am requesting input from a boarder in the Commonwealth. I&#39;ve been doing some reading up on cricket, but resources are not plentiful in the States and I&#39;m a little shaky on a few things that I have to get right.<br><br>Basically I&#39;m trying to do an AU of &quot;Casey at the Bat&quot; where it was cricket that prevailed in the States. In order to retain the ending, I think I have to make him a bowler trying to save the match, and describe him as an professional grade all-rounder to make that plausible.<br><br>With nine wickets down (the ninth being Flynn&#39;s final ball in the previous over), and the other team needing six more runs to win, Casey &quot;accidentally&quot; chucks the ball (that&#39;s five penalty runs, right?) to show off his ability to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat, and then spread-eagles the batsman&#39;s stumps--&quot;But there is no joy in Mudville/Casey&#39;s foot went o&#39;er the crease&quot;; and IIRC, a no ball (in addition to adding that winning run Casey doesn&#39;t want to allow) means that run out, handling the ball, hitting it twice, and obstructing the field are the only dismissal methods available, and moot if the ball is unhit. Is this correct for the 1880&#39;s (when CatB is set)?</p>

            <p>I played cricket at school and was actually pretty alright at it until I got my arm knackered. The problem that you have is that cricket is a very, very, very poor choice for a song like Casey At The Bat (Casey At The Oval?), entirely because of how it works, particularly in the time in which this is set. Not only that, but the scenario you talk about here actually happened. In the last ball of a match, needing a six to win, the Australian bowler decided to roll the ball along the ground, something that was entirely legal at the time. It nearly sparked an international incident. =]<br><br>If you&#39;re set on it, though, then put Casey in as a night-watchman and have him bludgeon the opposition&#39;s bowling attack all over the park. Might be a bit more feasible. =]</p>

            <p>I&#39;m honestly so glad that this cast was picked. As a long time supporter of POC Hermione, this felt like winning a little bit. The fact that JK is so excited about it as well makes the news all the sweeter.</p>

            <p>Honestly, who cares what race Hermione is? It is left purposefully vague, (though I think I remember a passage somewhere of her face being pink or something, but that was because she was blushing, so flimsy evidence at best)and does not effect her character <i>at all</i>. Do I see her as black? Personally, no. I see Emma Watson. But do I care that this play cast her in a way that goes against my personal view? Not even a smidgen. But if this bloke playing Ron does not get a ginger wig or something...<br><br>Admittedly, that is also why I am not going to celebrate this as if the casting is some grand beacon of progress. Oh, look, somebody casting based on talent not race. Why is this newsworthy again? Especially on the stage, which has always been looser with casting. So, I am going to do what frankly I think everybody else should do: hope for the best, and look forward to seeing the production at some point.</p>

Yikes. I&#39;m sorry, mate. Dedenne is just not a particularly good mon, though Interstellar Desk Plant is a decent held item for it. It gives you a couple of Berry effects when you kill an enemy, so try a set with Substitute, Recycle, Thunderbolt for STAB, and Grass Knot. Your ability, Cheek Pouch, will activate twice with each use of IDP, so it&#39;s about the only &#39;mon it&#39;s viable to use it on. Sorry, man. Them&#39;s the numbers.</p>
