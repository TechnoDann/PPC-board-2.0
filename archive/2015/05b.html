            <p>Hi, I&#39;m Alleb. I already made a post just below this one, but instead of formally introducing myself I jumped straight into a a question. Hence this.<br>Hi, I&#39;m Alleb. Formally.<br>Iximaz was kind enough to give me this shrieking hummingbird and urple bow, both of which I shall treasure to the end of my days. On a side note, Huinesoron, I deeply apologize- I spelled your name wrong in my original post. So very sorry sir! <br>I&#39;m a huge fan of Lord of the Rings, though I could be better on my Silmarillion knowledge (all the names of the battles go in one ear and out the other). I also enjoy the Chronicles of Narnia, the works of Brandon Sanderson, and the Lunar Chronicles. I hope to become more involved with the PPC in the future, and I&#39;m very glad to have found this community!  </p>

            <p>That would be awesome! I don&#39;t read many modern authors- Brandon Sanderson is just about it. I do like the Marissa Meyer. She writes this really awesome series called the Lunar Chronicles- they&#39;re futuristic retellings of classic fairy tales. Like Cinderella is called Cinder, and she&#39;s a cyborg mechanic. Love those books. I love his short stories too- have you read I Hate Dragons? It&#39;s on his author page, and it&#39;s SUPER funny. <br><br>What about you- what do you like to read?</p>

            <p>Tolkien and Lewis, of course- a few miscellaneous Christian YA authors and adult Christian authors- Monster by Frank Peretti is one of the first books I remember intensely loving (I suppose all of those count as modern, but I just read the stock I have instead of keeping up with them, so I didn&#39;t count them..). I&#39;ve gotten behind, but I&#39;m reading the Lord Peter Whimsey series. Have you read To Say Nothing of the Dog? AWESOME time travel book. I falsely categorized myself with &#39;modern&#39;- I meant authors that are currently alive, active, and coming out with new books, like Brandon Sanderson, as versus, say, Robert Jordan (I really liked his stuff, but I had to stop reading- they simply got too violent.)Also, it&#39;s only been rather recently that I&#39;ve started finding new authors, so I&#39;m used to identifying myself solely by Tolkien and Lewis. <br><br>Overall I&#39;m a fantasy nerd- occasionally I&#39;ll read a bit of science fiction or mystery.   <br><br>What is the Codex Alera series about? It sounds interesting!<br><br>Could you recommend some good urban fantasy? I like the sound of the genre, but I haven&#39;t read much of it. </p>

            <p>That is pretty good.  If you like Peretti&#39;s style I might recommend <i>House:  The Only Way Out is In </i> by Ted Dekker and Frank Peretti.  Though If I recall there probably is some harsh language.  And thematically it might not be perfect for you.  But it is a good read.  And if you like that kind of genre you might want to check out some of Stephen King&#39;s work.  Though I will say that those are targeted at an adult audience and often have strong language and certain thematic elements that you might take issue with.  If you are interested in Stephen King, I might recommend <i>Cell</i>.  I do not recall any substantial language, though it is probably there, and I do not recall any problematic themes.  </p>

            <p>It was the first book I ever read that made me want to forget the plot, so I could read it all over again. I think I might own House actually, but I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve read it. The language surprises me; I know Peretti is a Christian author, and I thought Dekker was as well. But then, not all Christians take the same Puritan stance that I do XD<br><br>I think Stephen King might be a bit.. much for me. I know he&#39;s a great author, but straight-up horror isn&#39;t really my cup of tea. Monster had its scary moments, but I wouldn&#39;t call it horror. Thanks for the suggestion, though!</p>

            <p>If <i>House</i> had language issues or not.  It is not something I pay attention to, but it might, so I figured I would err on the side of caution.  And not everything Stephen King does is horror.  There is <i>The Eyes of the Dragon</i> which is low fantasy.  <br><br>Lets see, some other recommendations that I would make.  I am going to assume you have probably read the <i>Left Behind</i> series.  If not, from what I understand, it seems right up your alley.  I also recommend <i>1Q84</i> by Haruki Murakami to anyone looking to expand their horizons.  Though I cannot remember if there was language issues or not, and it might thematically be inappropriate for your tastes.  It has been a while since I read it and I only vaguely remember the first half, but violence does have a role in it.  However, it is a phenomenal novel.  If you are looking for a challenge you might also consider <i>Les Miserables</i> by Victor Hugo.  <br><br>I do not know anything about it, but I have friends that really enjoy <i>The Mortal Instruments</i> by Cassandra Clare, but I know nothing of it other than the name, and I think it is generically categorized as &quot;Urban Fantasy&quot;.  The only other urban fantasy I am familiar with is <i>Anita Blake</i>, but I am certain that that is not going to be for you.  It has very strong language and as a whole the story itself could be classified as NSFW.<br><br>Anything else you are particularly interested in?      </p>

            <p>It&#39;s QUITE good; thank you! No language yet, other than the semi-appropriate use of the h-word. <br><br>What&#39;s 1Q84 about? I should probably read Les Miserables. I&#39;ve seen one of the older, non-musical adaptations, but that&#39;s it.<br><br>I&#39;ve actually read the first TMI book- it had a bit too much language for my tastes. It wasn&#39;t so much quantity as.. quality? Strength is a better term. Nothing so bad as the F-word, but practically everything else, I think. Which is a shame, because I really enjoyed the story. It was innovative and original, and the characters were good. <br><br>Anything fantasy, really, as long as it&#39;s fairly clean. I read a *little* sci-fi, but not much. Mysteries are lots of fun; and time travel books! What about you ?<br><br></p>

            <p><i>1Q84</i> is similar to George Orwell&#39;s <i>1984</i>.  But it is basically an alternate universe with some dystopian influences.  But now as I reread a summary of the plot, it looks like it may not be appropriate for you.  So for now, until I get the chance to reread the whole novel, you can disregard it as a suggestion.<br><br>If you like Time Travel stories, then <i>The Time Machine</i> by HG Wells is required.  It is the original.  Anything by HG Wells or Jules Verne is good.  Lets see, as for fantasy, I cannot really recommend anything, because most of what I read I already know will be objectionable.  Except maybe the <i>Inheritance Cycle</i> by Christopher Paolini.  But many people here find it poorly written, I do not because I think it is well suited for its target audience.  Its plot draws heavily from <i>Lord of the Rings</i> and <i>Star Wars</i>.<br><br>As for me?  Well I like a little bit of everything.  I am generally willing to read anything once, except for <i>Twilight</i>.  The idea of sparkly vampires is just wrong.  But to kind of show what I like I think I will just give a list of some of what I read.<br><br>1.<i>Moby Dick</i>, Herman Melville<br>2.<i>Dracula</i>, Bram Stoker<br>3.<i>Cujo</i>, Stephen King<br>4.<i>The Warlord Chronicles</i>, Bernard Cornwell<br>5.<i>A Song of Fire and Ice</i>, George RR Martin<br>6.<i>Les Miserables</i>, Victor Hugo<br>7.<i>Lord of the Rings</i>, Tolkien<br>8.<i>The Thrawn Trilogy</i>, Timothy Zahn.  Probably the best Star Wars EU stories out there.<br>9.<i>Fahrenheit 451</i>, Ray Bradbury<br>10.<i>Crime and Punishment</i> Fyodor Dostoyevsky<br><br>And there are many others.  But right now my biggest genres that I read (when I have the time) tend to be Dark Fantasy or Gothic Horror, but as I said, I am willing to read anything really at least once.  Some genres I have read in are Fantasy, Science Fiction, Gothic Horror, Psychological Thrillers, Military Political Thrillers, and the list goes on.</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve been meaning to get around to some Wells; I have a few of his works lying around. <br><br>You&#39;ve got eclectic taste- that&#39;s awesome! I should really broaden the scope of what I read; right now, my tastes are pretty limited. Have you ever read To Say Nothing of the Dog? It&#39;s a time travel book; hilarious and well-written. The first chapter or so is a bit odd, but once the plot gets going it&#39;s beautiful. (By the way, I apologize for my lack of italicized titles. I haven&#39;t looked up how to italicize on here yet)<br><br>I think you like slightly heavier stuff than I do, so I don&#39;t think I can do much to return your awesome favor of book recommendations :( You might like Brandon Sanderson, though. I don&#39;t know if you&#39;ve heard of him or not; he&#39;s a fantasy author, probably best known for his Mistborn trilogy, which is VERY good. I heartily recommend him.</p>

            <p>First to do italics,  to open and  to close it.  Just make sure that there is no space after the &lt;.&gt;<br>I have not read <i>To Say Nothing of the Dog</i>.  I do not much care for a lot of time travel stories.  It is too easy to get it wrong.  I may have heard of Sanderson in passing.  And as I said, I basically will read anything once, or at least try, so I do go all over the place.  <br><br>If I recall you mentioned you were interested in doing your own writing.  Do you have a particular genre you write in?  Like my reading interests my writing is also all over the place.  Off the top of my head I&#39;ve written Low Dark Fantasy with a touch of Gallows Humor, &quot;Soft&quot; Science Fiction, Psychological Horror (one of the few times I consider what I wrote a complete failure), Gothic Urban Horror, Military Political Thriller, and a Metafiction Comedy (also a disaster).  </p>

            <p>That&#39;ll be handy.<br><br>I write in fantasy; that&#39;s all so far. I&#39;d like to write in different genres eventually. At least one mystery, some sci-fi, a zombie novel (strange ambition of mine), a western, and a time travel story. You have quite a nice list there; if I may ask, what length do you prefer? I&#39;m attempting to write full books, but I&#39;m a slow author. </p>

            <p>Check out Charles de Lint. He writes some of the most amazing short stories I&#39;ve ever read, and has some really beautiful things to say about writing and the world in general.<br><br>I also recommend Sherri S. Tepper, who is hard to classify. Wikipedia says she writes &quot;feminist science fiction&quot; with an &quot;ecofeminist slant,&quot; but I personally think that&#39;s an oversimplification. She&#39;s a philosopher, if you ask me. She thinks about things from a different perspective, and shows them to you, and by the time you&#39;re done you&#39;re not quite sure which way is up anymore. That&#39;s why I like her so much. {= )<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Ultimately, the purpose of a soldier is to kill, and that makes it very difficult for me, as a pacifist, to trust them. There&#39;s a fundamental difference in ideology that unfortunately cannot be rectified there: Soldiers believe that killing is okay in certain circumstances, and I believe that it&#39;s <i>never</i> okay.<br><br>I don&#39;t mean to insult members of any military force, but I&#39;ve always believed that war is pointless, and does nothing but waste human life. Unfortunately, our society glorifies warfare, so most people nowadays have their heads filled with the idea that a soldier is the coolest thing ever, forgetting the fact that fighting is <i>traumatic</i>.<br><br>I&#39;m sorry, but I just don&#39;t like the military.

            <p>What you are talking about is being a Conscientious Objector.  In the US it is pretty narrow.  You must be opposed to all war in any form and the objection must be sincere.  From what I understand during the Vietnam War (last time the US used conscription) it basically acted as a mini-court case.  Its burden was much higher than just reasonably prove.  From what I understand it required something maybe not quite as high as what a Civil Lawsuit would require, but close. <br><br>But also in the US, unless World War III starts and Nuclear Weapons are not used, the US Government will not bring back the draft.  We have an incredibly large volunteer armed forces.  </p>

Sad as it is, we don&#39;t live in an ideal world where nobody has any need of a military. It&#39;s better to have that presence well-established and trained so when the inevitable happens, you can minimize casualties instead of having a country that is easily steamrolled and millions are left dead because people tried the ideal route.</p>

            <p>As someone currently serving as well...<br><br>The US is not going to be bringing back the draft anytime soon. We are currently more than capable of operating at full functioning capabilities with <i>volunteers</i>. You don&#39;t need to make such a bold statement as that.

            <p>My father is a soldier and he had this to say when I brought up a topic similar to this one:<br><br><br>War is the final act of diplomacy. More specifically, it is the indicator of <b>failure</b>. Failure at the highest echelons of the government to reach out and work out a peaceful solution with the other party. He&#39;d be <i>happy</i> to be out of a job but the fact of the matter is that there will always be a need for soldiers: everything on this planet is a competition and humans are no exception. When there is no compromise to be reached and the opposing group threatens your very existence, you fight. <br><br>My father&#39;s job is to make sure that that fight is as short as possible and inflicts the minimal amount of collateral damage. It sounds stupid, yes, and he admits that no war at all is the ideal. If there is to be war, then it must be as swift and painless as possible: there is a reason Sun Tzu says that &quot;There is no instance of a nation benefitting from prolonged warfare.&quot; Nobody wins. It&#39;s a horrifying, brutal affair. <br><br><br>With regards to your position on killing, take the rise of the so-called Islamic State for example. They have imposed a brutal regime focused on oppressing anyone who is Different. They persecute the Shia (who they consider &quot;infidels&quot; even though they are Muslim too) and the Christians and drive them from their lands, they pillage and destroy villages and cultural sites, they fund terror cells worldwide, they brutally execute prisoners of war (beheadings, burning alive, etc.), and oppose the governments of the various territories they control. If left to their own designs, will IS expand? Certainly. Do the people who live in areas near IS <i>want</i> them as their neighbours? Hell no.<br><br>There is only one thing left to do. The people take up arms and fight. They resist, they <i>kill</i> the invaders. It&#39;s not a pointless affair: this is about survival. <br><br><br>War is horrible and shouldn&#39;t happen but it does. Therefore we need people to fight and bring it to an end whenever it does happen.</p>

            <p>Or on how terrible things are, or how terrible things could be.<br><br>I&#39;m in the military because I don&#39;t <i>want</i> people to be forced to fight for their lives- I want to be one of the people who <i>help</i>.<br><br>The military- the American one, at least- isn&#39;t just compromised of soldiers, after all, and their goal isn&#39;t only to wage war.<br><br>The US Navy has ships that serve as floating hospitals that get deployed at the drop of a hat to go to places that need aid.

Volunteer for causes you care about, be <i>active</i> about helping. Actively improving the world- even in small things- is something you can do to <i>prove</i> plenty of people wrong and to show that your viewpoint and opinions not only matter, but can change the world as well.</p>

            <p>The main reason we &#39;got away&#39; with that is because there really were no better alternatives. We have vaccines, yes- pretty much everyone born before the mid 60s at least got them- but extremely unfortunately it&#39;s far more difficult to get everyone vaccinated and kill a disease off that way than to use a quarantine. <br><br>The whole procedure regarding diseases that aren&#39;t easily cured but are highly contagious kinda involves that sort of thing because there isn&#39;t very much you can do from a medical standpoint besides prevention and treatment.<br><br>Though, also, part of the reason there was intervention with the ebola outbreak (which has only been contained, it&#39;s improving, but it&#39;s still <i>there</i>) is because it was spreading faster than health officials were able to fight it on their own just because of sheer lack of knowledge and supplies in the affected region in the first place. </p>

            <p>I agree.  I personally think it is naive to ignore the outside world just because there is so much bad.  I also think that unless and until a fully unified Utopian World Government exists (which will never happen) armed forces will always be required.  One need only look to Germany&#39;s earlier war successes during World War II to see precisely why armed forces will always be required.  Because ultimately, there will always be the Kim Jong Uns, the Adolf Hitlers, the Julius Caesars, and other would-be conquerors.  And there will always be the Saddam Husseins and the Pol Pots.      </p>

            <p>Yes - but it shouldn&#39;t have to be.<br><br>I&#39;m going to hold up the ever-unpopular European Union here for a minute. Yes, it rose out of the back of a war - but it&#39;s not stayed intact because of military force. Germany isn&#39;t sitting there going &#39;now we&#39;ve got our feet under us again, it&#39;s only a matter of time before France lets its guard down and we can start World War Three&#39;; Britain isn&#39;t going &#39;man, if only the others would scrap their navies we could totally blow up their ports&#39;. By and large, the established EU has achieved peace by... um... cooperating, instead of competing. Yes, there&#39;s competition on a parliamentary level, but once it all shakes out, we have a functioning (if rather weak) EU government.<br><br>&quot;But Russia invaded Ukraine!&quot; &quot;But IS want to kill us!&quot; Yes, I know, and that&#39;s why I&#39;m speaking only of internal lack of conflict - but on the other hand, the EU is only &#39;internal&#39; because it&#39;s <i>working</i>. Britain at peace with both Germany and France? Inconceivable!<br><br>Yes, it&#39;s hard for nations to get along without being worried that their neighbours are going to attack them if they show weakness - but it <i>is</i> possible. And if it&#39;s possible between Britain, France, and Germany, with all that historical bickering, then there&#39;s only a handful of places I&#39;d say it&#39;s <i>not</i> possible.<br><br>(Which include, for the record: Israel and Palestine, China and Taiwan, North and South Korea, and India and Pakistan. Lot of anger in those four. Also, Russia needs a change of outlook before it seems likely to cooperate very much.)<br><br>~<br><br>But what about internal threats like IS, or like the IRA a few years back? Yeah, that&#39;s a fair point, and I can&#39;t really come up with a solution that isn&#39;t the military. But a situation which is internal to both the union as a whole, and one of its member states, can make use of a relatively small force taken from everywhere, rather than a huge one taken from an individual state.

            <p>The military, as I said, is a necessary evil. Most soldiers don&#39;t like it, either. <br>However, I have two problems with what you say.<br>One is that killing yourself is not easy. It takes a special kind of courage - or despair, depending on your reasons - to do that. I don&#39;t think people should say that they&#39;ll kill themselves before doing something lightly - this is a thing of great importance indeed.<br>The second is logical in nature - if killing is never OK, how is killing yourself before taking another person&#39;s life OK? Either killing is always not OK, which means that killing yourself isn&#39;t OK, or killing is OK in certain circumstances (in which case you need to define them).</p>

            <p>Let me explain my position to my own satisfaction, because it&#39;s probably not going to be to yours.<br><br>I&#39;m extremely anti-war, and rather pro-international law. This... does tend to put one on something of a collision course with the IDF&#39;s more, for want of a better term, militant supporters. Perhaps it&#39;s hindsight talking (the entire region being my people&#39;s comprehensive cockup in the first place), but - while I wholeheartedly support Israeli statehood - I think a better solution could have been reached than the one that has led to the state of Israel being tiny and, to the common-or-garden outside observer, militaristic to a frankly absurd degree. My position on militarism in general is summed up by this verse from Billy Bragg:<br><br>&quot;I kept the faith and I kept voting/<br>Not for the iron fist but for the helping hand/<br>For theirs is a land with a wall around it/<br>And mine is a faith in my fellow man/<br>Theirs is a land of hope and glory/<br>Mine is the green field and the factory floor/<br>Theirs are the skies all dark with bombers/<br>And mine is the peace we knew/<br>Between the wars&quot;<br><br>Please don&#39;t get me wrong; I sincerely believe in the right of Israel to be a state. I just think that over the course of <i>creating</i> that state, the British Government of the day made a complete and comprehensive Horlicks of the entire affair to the point where what was meant to be a safe haven for the thousands of displaced and downtrodden is a bunker full of sand and guns. We messed it up. The blame for all the lives lost lies, at least in part, at my people&#39;s door.<br><br>In part.</p>

            <p>Generally speaking, I dislike war, and killing and senseless suffering. You have to be completely off your rocker to like that. The problem is that in the world as it is today, power - including but not limited to military power - is a necessary evil. International law without military power to back it is a joke, as Syria (where Assad gassed his own people) and Crimea (where Putin decided that the peninsula is his now) show, and a sad joke at that.<br><br>Israel is militaristic mainly because its neighbours are various shades of bloodthirsty madmen (it was nationalists in my grandparents&#39; time and it&#39;s overly-religious fundies now, but they&#39;re pretty much the same thing with regards to Israel) who seem to have lost their ability to talk and reason somewhere along the way; the other choice is to let them butcher us, and I think the Jewish people as a collective had enough of that - being unable to protect itself - for hundreds of years which culminated in the Holocaust. Never again, and if we have to kill others to get some peace, so be it. Maybe it&#39;ll get through their thick skulls that they should mind their own business and let us exist in peace.<br><br>You know, being in the military gives you perspective. I don&#39;t mean the drivel they tell you in basic training; that&#39;s bullshit that even the commanders don&#39;t really believe. But - even as an administrator whose job can be summed up as &#39;telling people to do logistical things A, B and C because there&#39;s an angry officer who wants them done yesterday&#39;, I&#39;ve seen things that made me stay up until late at night; things that made me realise there isn&#39;t any choice. Considering the environment we live in, peace through superior firepower is the only choice: <i>si vis pacem, para bellum</i> (if you want peace, prepare for war). Would that it be different, but it isn&#39;t. That is the harsh reality of the Middle East.</p>

            <p>Vetinari&#39;s quote isn&#39;t diametrically opposed to the Latin phrase I quote earlier - it doesn&#39;t say anything about desiring peace. It is obvious that if you want war, you should prepare for it; what the phrase I quoted means is that even if you want peace, you must prepare for war - because your enemies won&#39;t just go &quot;ah, he wants peace, we won&#39;t kill him now, let&#39;s all be friends&quot;. They&#39;d go, &quot;ah, he&#39;s not defending himself? Itbakh al-Yahud!&quot; and kill you.</p>

            <p>Sorry to butt in, and I don&#39;t intend to step on any toes, but... If everyone around you wants to and is actively trying to wipe you off the map, I would say that having at least some form of defense is a necessity. War should not be a thing. It is horrendous and ugly. But... It is a thing. Even if you don&#39;t desire war, those who do may not give you a choice.</p>

            <p>*eagerly takes popcorn* It&#39;s both, really. The general premise is futuristic retellings of Classic fairy tales- the first book is Cinder, in which Cinderella is a cyborg mechanic in the Eastern Commonwealth. There&#39;s werewolves (sorta) and a moon colony that is home to the main antagonist, Queen Levana. They&#39;re really good, I fully recommend them. The author actually started out writing Sailor Moon fanfiction, which she said helped her learn the craft. Thanks for the t shirt! </p>

            <p>Grumble, grumble.<br><br>It’s hard to come up with something more than generic praise, and &quot;Insert generic praise here&quot; isn’t funny anymore if I do it too often. I realize that I tend to fall back into lurking mode and not comment at all when I can’t nitpick on errors that escaped the beta reader(s). That’s bad. Good writers should be made aware that I don’t ignore them.<br><br>*More grumbling.*<br><br>Ah, nitpicking. I remember now that there’s actually a point where I hesitated for a moment, but I was so immersed in the story that I didn’t want to pause and take a note.  *Rereading*<br><br><i>A light show exploded as Bellatrix went on the attack, her eyes bright with mad glee as she shrieked insults between her spells; she&#39;d cornered her niece at last, and nothing was going to stop her from wiping the stain off the family tree for good now.</i><br><br>Up to here and after it again, it’s all from Tonks’ POV. But in the second part of this sentence, are we suddenly in Bellatrix’s  head? Is an omniscient narrator jumping in to explain Bellatrix’s motives, or is this a plausible conclusion Tonks can come to?  I don’t know how to do it better; it just doesn’t feel perfectly right.<br><br>Should I tell you how much I like what you did with Ginny Weasley? Realizing that she doesn’t <b>need</b> to be there took me even longer than finding the One Flaw, because teaming her up with Tonks is so fitting for both characters that it just seems to come naturally.<br><br>HG</p>

            <p>So, I was wandering YouTube when I came across <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uGfgAS3aok"> this animation.</a> It is an animation about a logic puzzle. While it involves ponies, you should watch it even if you don&#39;t watch MLP. I am going to be honest: I have absolutely no idea what the answer is. So, I need your help to solve it.<br><br>And don&#39;t try looking up the answer either. There is a commonly accepted one by the brony community, but I refuse to see it as a solution to a logic puzzle. Unless you can explain how that answer makes sense, I don&#39;t buy it. </p>

            <p>My listening ability is far less developed than my ability to read this strange language. Thus, I’m not entirely sure what the question actually is and what the reactions to Twilight’s answers are, and I simply have to trust Huinesoron’s  <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=275550;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">transcription of the correct answers</a>.<br><br>As far as I understand this, whenever Twilight says a number, the answer is not correct because it’s a fragment and thus <b>grammatically</b> incorrect. A correct answer must be a grammatically correct sentence. The actual number doesn’t matter, because the result of any attempt to count the stars is subjective, depending on eyesight, atmospheric conditions and other circumstances. (And that’s probably what some other posters try to say, just in other words.)<br><br>HG</p>

            <p>Provided you have a Turing-complete computer, of course!<br><br>You see, the present composition of the universe is a direct result of the <i>history</i> of the universe. That means that - with a powerful-enough computer - you can calculate back from a sample of the universe to describe its origin - and then calculate <i>forward</i> again to deduce any desired fact (such as the number of stars in the night sky).<br><br>But that only applies for a <i>representative</i> sample. The elements that make up an eyepiece, lamp, flower, field of grass, etc, are not representative of the universe as a whole. Thus, every time you calculate from one of those objects, you will obtain a different answer. (Admittedly the answer with pi stars must have been an interesting simulation.)<br><br>Then why is Pink Thing claiming you can do it by <i>looking</i> at the objects? Simple: <i>those aren&#39;t ponies</i>. I mean, you know that, right? You know they&#39;re just computer animation, not actual real-live ponies? Heck, it&#39;s even flagged up by the fourth-wall breaking!<br><br>And there&#39;s a key word in there: <b>computer</b>. Yes, the animation was clearly made on the turing-complete system I discussed above.<br><br>So the answer is: I&#39;m not a computer, Pink Thing, I can&#39;t do that. Why don&#39;t you calculate it for me and let me know?<br><br>^_~<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>The correct answers, in order, are:<br><br>&quot;There are four hundred and twenty stars.&quot;<br>&quot;There are eighty stars, tonight.&quot;<br>&quot;There are three point one four one five nine two six five stars.&quot;<br>&quot;What if I say there are one hundred and seventeen times ten to the power of three point forty-three stars?&quot;<br>&quot;I thought there were absolutely no stars tonight.&quot;<br><br>There are, clearly, two possible answers. The second requires a bit of calculation, and I&#39;ll do it later; the first is obvious simply by looking.<br><br>-Taken as a RGB code, &#39;420&#39; is a dark orange colour. Orange is practically the same colour as pink.<br>-In both ASCII and Unicode, decimal 80 is the code for &#39;P&#39;.<br>-3.14 etc is, of course, pi.<br>-117x10^3.43 comes out as 314909; that&#39;s a very clear simple visual code for &#39;is agog&#39;.<br>-&#39;no&#39; means 0, which can be read as &#39;oh&#39;.<br><br>Thus, the string of answers reads:<br><br>&quot;<i>pink</i> P pi is agog! Oh...&quot;<br><br>This is, of course, a third-person statement that Pinkie Pie is awestruck by the sheer beauty of the stars - which, if you recall, was the trigger for the entire conversation. Given that the character being addressed is called Twilight, the final answer is obvious:<br><br>4, because there are four books in Stephanie Meyer&#39;s <i>Twilight</i> series.<br><br>^_^<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>As stated before, the solution can be anything as long as it fits the question asked. It&#39;s not a true logic puzzle - it depends on the target&#39;s inherent acceptance that because they are told it is, the solution will follow the rules usually followed in logic puzzles.

Birthdays are an excuse to party and have fun. You can gather your friends and do silly things together, or go to a restaurant with your family, or any of a plethora of other things.

            <p>You don&#39;t have to be active, or even really have a plan - just get some people you know (the closer you know them, the better, IMO) and find something fun to do. Watch a movie, play a game, take a trip! What you do isn&#39;t important so long as it&#39;s something you enjoy with people who are important to you. :)</p>

            <p>-I&#39;m iffy about college, though getting a mathematics or creative writing degree once we move to Arizona has crossed my mind.<br><br>-I&#39;m kinda scared of the idea of ME driving. I forget what I&#39;m doing too much to think I can.<br><br>-That depends on figuring out how to survive on my own... I once had to stay home (I still worked at Steak n Shake) while my family traveled to Arizona for two weeks. I had two cats for company then, and the house was a disaster when my family got back.<br><br>-I know exactly zip about taxes.<br><br>-I&#39;m not terribly interested in Half-Life.<br><br>The point I was making, though, is that BIRTHDAYS no longer mean anything to me. Next February, hurrah, I&#39;ll be another year closer to a casket. Not much to celebrate.</p>

            <p>Yeah, we&#39;re all gonna die someday. Every birthday, every month, every day, every hour, <i>every living moment</i> of yours is accompanied by the sound of your biological clock ticking towards The End. You&#39;re dying as you read this message. <br><br>So what are you going to do about it? Here&#39;s my (crappy and completely unsolicited) advice: go out there and <i>do</i> something.

            <p>Sure, every second you live brings you closer to death. That can&#39;t be helped. But every moment you exist brings opportunities to learn new things, to have an effect on others. Everything you do changes the world, even in the smallest way - remember that, and make those changes be the best they can be!</p>

            <p>Just kidding. Happy birthday! Have this &quot;eggnog gone deliciously wrong&quot; cake. It&#39;s made with Suegar because I didn&#39;t have any of the normal kind of sugar left, but at least, the color is covered by the icing. It does still have that special flavour, though.

            <p>Found out about the PPC via OFUM and Tvtropes.<br>Original series, yes that&#39;s what brought me into lurkerdom. Constitution, yes whilst considering exiting aforementioned lurkerdom. <br>Fandoms: Tolkien,Pratchett, Gaiman, Old Kingdom, Earthsea,Les Mis,Harry Potter and some second hand fandoms, mainly MCU and Atla/Korra. There may be smaller ones as well. Currently reading Ray Bradbury and Soseki Natsume&#39;s I am a Cat.<br>I have read spin-offs, and enjoyed: DOGA; the Mara&amp;Isiah stuff; Trojie&amp;Pads; those with Agent Suicide in; and have read most of the sporkings of Legendary Badfics.<br>Cis-female, so as usual.  <br></p>

            <p>This is more of a reintroduction I guess than nothing else, if mainly because I&#39;m hoping to poke my head in a bit more than I have been the last year or so, thanks to a change in circumstance that has me doing odd tasks at strange hours usually in a location filled with gray mazelike passageways and doors that at random intervals will hold a room that was most definitely not occupied or even in use several hours ago, where the powers that be do not always make sense but you&#39;re supposed to do what they say anyways, if you can&#39;t make do with what you&#39;ve got you gotta MacGyver it, and there&#39;s always the distinct probability of things exploding and/or suddenly becoming on fire. (I also wouldn&#39;t eat the food or think too hard on it, if given the option, but that&#39;s neither here nor there.)<br><br>Anyways, to all those new people who don&#39;t know who I am, hello, I&#39;m July, I&#39;ve been around for quite a few years (with a short break), I may or may not be a PG at this point in time (honestly, that is a very good question), and I&#39;m a spontaneous and continuous fountain of Excellent Bad Ideas (as many can attest or have witnessed). I&#39;m also a pro at travel planning (as a few others here can vouch). I&#39;ve got a spin-off that I really, really, really need to make available online again, and missions that have been in the works for so long that were they human children they&#39;d be in school by now. <br><br>I&#39;ve got a fairly steady set of canons I&#39;m interested, primarily books (and comics), including but not limited to Pterry, Brandon Sanderson, the Harry Potter series, so on, so on. <br><br>Anyways, heyo to everyone who knows me from before, and I promise to not bite <s>too hard</s> any new people.</p>

            <p>It&#39;s a self-serve frozen yogurt shop. They&#39;re very popular, at least around here. It&#39;s not difficult and the pay is decent. I make about half per hour what I was before, but I should be getting more hours in a week, so it works out. {= ) Plus, I should be more motivated to actually do stuff with my days off.

            <p>We are not, contrary to popular belief, frozen year-round. And even then, just because it is cool outside, why would we not want something tasty? Do you only eat ice cream when it&#39;s super hot? Doubt it.<br><br>Speaking of ice cream, I also seem to remember Alaska being the largest per capita consumers of ice cream in the US, though that may be wrong.<br><br>Also, welcome back!

            <p>It pertains to Permission, which I would like to get someday, but obviously not today. So, it&#39;s clearly stated that one cannot write before obtaining said Permission, but I sort of assume that by &#39;write&#39; it means &#39;write and publish.&#39; Is it okay to write, say, from the 36 prompts before getting Permission, as long as you do it solely for you own practice and without spreading it across the internet? I&#39;d like the experience. I wouldn&#39;t say no to being able to write a mission or two for myself, but for now I&#39;ll stick with the prompts, if that&#39;s permitted.</p>

            <p>That seems fairly quick! I&#39;ll wait a while, familiarize myself with you lovely people. I think the Permission giving is a really smart idea, do you happen to know who thought of it?

            <p>Bet those publishers who rejected her are still kicking themselves. :P<br><br>Anyway, I think the original Permission system was basically &#39;ask Jay or Acacia&#39; and later &#39;ask Miss Cam, Thalia Weaver, or GreyLadyBast&#39;.

            <p>The system in place now and the system in place when I asked were fairly similar. Only difference is, back then, you just submitted brief bios and a short piece of writing.

            <p>In the beginning was Eru, the One, that in Arda is called Iluvatar-<br><br>No, wait, wrong story.<br><br>When Jay and Acacia first wrote the PPC, I don&#39;t think they expected anyone else to want to write it - but people did! So they made some vague rules about how to do so. The idea of asking for permission came, I suspect, from Miss Cam and OFUM; there was a lot of crossover between the OFUM newsgroup and the early PPC community. When the PPC was pulled from FF.net, Miss Cam hosted their missions, and that site is where the Permission rules come from.<br><br><i>If you want to write your own spinoff, there are a very few rules we&#39;d prefer you to follow. (Not compulsory, of course.)<br><br>Okay. Things you should and should not do when writing spinoffs. This is, generally, only &quot;should&quot;.<br><br>1. Email Miss Cam or ask at the PPC Board for permission before posting. If you don&#39;t do this, at the very least tell us you&#39;ve written one and send the link, so it can be linked in the Archive. Also if you don&#39;t get it beta&#39;d, use a spellcheck.<br>2. If you&#39;re introducing a new Department, keep to the naming traditions. Department of Mary Sues, Department of Bad Slash, Department of Personnel, Department of Intelligence.. are you seeing a pattern? Good. Stick to it.<br>3. We&#39;ve written some fun gadgets. Use them. This is, obviously, only a suggestion.<br>4. Another stylistic suggestion: Inside jokes are fun. Many jokes about Discworld, a few movies, and various random things we&#39;ve seen online are made in the original PPC, the towel stuff in Clan of the Cactus made me giggle, it&#39;s fun.<br>5. Say, in your Author&#39;s Note, what fic you&#39;re entering. New spinoff writers need to know what has and hasn&#39;t been done. MSTers may be looking for material. Morbidly curious people like me may actually want to read the fics.<br>6. Pay attention to the Backstory. Try not to contradict.</i><br><br>Yeah, it&#39;s pretty simple, and the &#39;permission&#39; can even be given retroactively!<br><br>As time passed, Jay and Acacia left. They appointed Miss Cam (already in place, you can see), GreyLadyBast, and Thalia Weaver as their official Permission Givers; I think that&#39;s where the title comes from. At this point the process was still pretty loose: I&#39;ve <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=275017">recently described</a> how I got permission to write DOGA.<br><br>But time kept on, well, passing. Someone (Bast?) told Leto Haven he could give out Permission as well, which was fine, but then Thalia left amidst drama, Cam stopped frequenting the Board, and Bast went off in a huff. Over that span of time, various other people were told they could hand out Permission -  BeautyID, Bjam, NenyaQuende, Tough Cookie, Rohirric Monkey, and our very own still-around-somewhere PG, Araeph. When several of them left, they appointed a few more - TZA, Doc Filth.<br><br>But Permission was changing, as it got further and further from Jay and Acacia&#39;s authority. It was somewhere in that period that they started asking for a sample of your writing and a description of your agents; nothing particularly defined, but it was there. They also made a firm requirement that you ask on the Board, rather than by email; prior to that, email was quite common! It&#39;s how Kaitlyn got her Permission (from Thalia Weaver, I think).<br><br>In 2006 (yes, all of four years after the PPC began), we altered how we appointed PGs - we switched it over to elections. I was brought in on the very first election (and yes, I <i>did</i> protest and say I didn&#39;t want the job. They didn&#39;t listen), along with Techno-Dann. We&#39;ve had another... five, I think, elections since, plus one extra-normal appointment (JulyFlame designated Cassie as her successor when she left; that&#39;s what she meant about her PG status being a bit vague).<br><br>How Permission is actually obtained has changed too, generally under two opposing influences. Neshomeh and Araeph have been a driving force in making things more strict - looking hard at SPG, requiring decent characters and a clear grasp of writing humour and the PPC. On the flip side, I&#39;ve been trying to make the process easier - people were having to ask repeatedly because their writing sample wasn&#39;t humour, for instance, so I&#39;ve worked us through several iterations of &#39;specific PPC writing sample&#39;. The Random Prompts are the current version of that - people were previously mostly writing their agents&#39; arrivals, and those all tend to come out the same.<br><br>For a long time we also had a hard limit of &#39;be here a month before you asked&#39;, but (in a rare moment of agreement) we did away with that on the basis that people were reading it as &#39;on the 32nd day you&#39;re on the Board, you MUST ask for Permission, and you WILL receive it&#39;. Yeah.<br><br>So what&#39;s the future of Permission? Personally, and I know Nesh disagrees, I want to do away with agent profiles. I want a Permission Request to consist of nothing more than a piece of writing with your agents in it; if I can&#39;t tell who they are from that, you need to rewrite it anyway. Actually, my <i>ideal</i> scenario would be for Permission to become PerMission - you write your first mission, and a PG says whether you need to go back and rework it. But that would be horrible for the people involved, so let&#39;s not do that. ;) Other ideas have included a sort of mirror of the Sib Houses - a PG with a few concerns, but not a &#39;total failure&#39; scenario, can ask for a longer-term PPCer to take you under their writing wing until you&#39;ve found your feet, granting you &#39;Permission under so-and-so&#39; until they say you&#39;re good enough.<br><br>And that, at least, is how I remember it. <a href="http://the-ppc.livejournal.com/19335.html">Araeph wrote a post</a> describing the early events slightly different; I know for a fact that she&#39;d wrong about Leto, because the Board Archives include him giving out Permission before even Thalia had left! But she may be right about the rest.<br><br>[Vanishes in a cloud of pixels]<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>The more I learn about the history of the PPC, the more I WANT to learn. So basically the process went from &quot;Here&#39;s a few guidelines,&quot; to &quot;We need a sample,&quot; to what it is today. Interesting. I can see why, as the community grew, it would become harder and harder to judge who could write missions and who could not. I think the current system is quite nice, but the alternate Sib Houses sound handy too. Anyway, thank you for the back story!</p>

            <p>The way I got Permission was actually pretty simple; I wrote a couple agent bios and a writing sample (mine was actually a prologue, creatively named &quot;Introducing the Agents&quot;, but it wasn&#39;t required for the sample to be connected to the PPC) and found myself a badfic to spork. As Ixi mentioned, it took me four or five times - about a year - to get it.</p>

            <p>My best answer is to direct you to the <a href="http://www.uua.org/beliefs">Unitarian Universalist Association&#39;s website</a>. (Scroll down past the large image to get to the actual content; I don&#39;t know why websites do that.) Especially check out the Seven Principles.<br><br>My second-best answer is that we&#39;re a religion without a creed; we believe that people deserve to be treated with a basic level of dignity even if we don&#39;t agree with them; we embrace people&#39;s differences rather than abhorring them; we take wisdom where we find it; we advocate responsible stewardship for the planet we share with each other and every living thing; and we basically just want everyone to get along and be good to one other. {= )<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>But I think that in most cases we won&#39;t spork it. I know that if I&#39;d see a fic that starts terribad and becomes better over time, I&#39;d contact the author, offer concrit, and suggest editing the beginning so it&#39;ll conform to the higher standards of the later part.</p>

            <p>you&#39;re exactly right: the &quot;name day&quot; celebration has its roots in the Catholic celebration of saints&#39; days--so it makes perfect sense that traditionally-Protestant nations like the UK and the US don&#39;t celebrate them.</p>

            <p>The story first:<br><br><a href="http://www.ansereg.com/mpqp_rant.htm">Magweth Pengolodh: The Question of Pengolod</a> is a tale of Numenor at its height, and of Beleriand in its decline, and of elves, and of mortals, and of wonder, and of terror. I&#39;ve linked to it by way of the author&#39;s note, which points out the reasons you might <i>not</i> want to read it:<br><br><i>You may enjoy this if you are interested in Númenor or in the Silmarillion in general, or if a philosophical exploration of differences between elves and mortals is up your alley. There will be 12 parts. &#39;Magweth Pengolod&#39; has got linguistics, romance, drag queens, schemers, villains, boats galore, and through the tale-within-a-tale device, plenty of Silmarillion glimpses and some HoME characters getting fleshed out.<br>...<br>A 12-part story based on HoME characters? Spiced up with linguistic obsession and drag queens? If I&#39;d sat down and thought really hard about how to scare off 95% of Tolkien fan readers, that&#39;s what I&#39;d come up with.</i><br><br>I really enjoyed it; it&#39;s one of those stories that takes you into the world for a walk-around, rather than the kind that drags you along with plot. ;) It spends a lot of time showing you the things around the edges of Tolkien&#39;s world, the bits he never got to write - what it was like to fight in the Fall of Gondolin, for instance. Plus, did you <i>read</i> that description? It&#39;s got linguistics!<br><br>Stories like this always leave me feeling... different. Like I&#39;m halfway into the world myself, like I could spend hours looking at the stars, and can almost hear the voices of the trees. Not just Middle-earth, either - give me a story of magic I&#39;ve not read, and you&#39;ll have me half convinced the magic&#39;s real by the end. ;) Some books even alter my way of speaking for a little while - I get stuck in &#39;noble speechifying&#39; mode, it&#39;s kinda hilarious. ;)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Seriously, I&#39;m reading it as I write this.<br><br>Anyway, speaking about questions, Middle-earth, linguistics and... uh, drag queens, I&#39;ve got a weird question for you:<br><br>What&#39;s your hypothesis about what would happen if an <i>elleth</i> spent a little too much time with (and by that I mean living with, speaking with, learning Real Life languages from, and being tortured alonside) the fangirls from the OFUM? How would her speech patterns change, if they do at all? How would that affect her mindset and the way she sees the world? Would she get PTSD? <i>Will she start liking stuffed toys!?</i><br><br>Despite the apparent silliness of the question, I actually have been seriously meditating that question since I joined the Board (except for the stuffed toys part, that one&#39;s a truly silly question), so I really want to know your thoughts on that. </p>

            <p>What would happen if an American girl spent her time living with, speaking with, and learning slang from some girls from the north of England? The answer is the same: depends on the girl! Some Americans in Britain go &#39;hyper-American&#39; and protest that everything American is better; some do the opposite and end up with hilariously fake &#39;English&#39; accents; and some walk the middle path and just sort of absorb things.<br><br>So you might end up with someone like <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xFF8he9DI24dk5CA_YUVGdAWQJFBvIRzMQzJ8aErGek/pub">Agent Huinesoron</a>, who&#39;s disdainful about mortals and thinks in Quenya (deliberately so). But... okay, let&#39;s design a character.<br><br>Lethril (&#39;eavesdropper&#39;, hilariously - and yes, there&#39;s a masculine form as well!) is a fairly quiet Green-elf from the First Age. She lives in Doriath, speaks Doriathrin Sindarin, and can vaguely write - she&#39;s aware of the runes, knows about half of them, that sort of thing. (No, the Doriathrim weren&#39;t particularly literate! See P@L&#39;s comments on &#39;Sindarin-style record keeping&#39;.) Her mother is a hunter, her father a smith. Her favourite season is winter, because the ice on the river reminds her of crystals; her most treasured possession is a dwarf-made bracelet set with faceted quartz crystals.<br><br>(As an aside: see how easy it is to invoke a character without spending your time listing powers and weapons?)<br><br>And then she&#39;s dumped into OFUM and has to learn English, and is abused by the staff over her habit of telling her friends back home whimsical stories about life around Cuivienen (she doesn&#39;t understand why - what was <i>wrong</i> with her tale of Bainion the Fair and the way he healed the rift between the Lindar and the Gódhellim by being Just Plain Better than everyone else?).<br><br>She&#39;d likely pick up English very quickly - elves do, you know. Given that she&#39;s a native Sindarin speaker, her main problem might well be a tendency to soften the first letters of words - &#39;the &#39;irls vrought me flowers, and I was hincerely voved&#39; - but she&#39;d get a handle on that. Conversely, when switching back to Sindarin, she might <i>lose</i> the mutations, which would sound equally strange.<br><br>She&#39;d probably use colloquial English - she&#39;s picking it up from conversation, not from lessons, after all - but that wouldn&#39;t filter back into Sindarin. She&#39;d probably start mixing idioms between the two, though - the Doriathrim were great mixers of culture.<br><br>Her outlook on life... there&#39;s a lovely speech in the <a href="http://rustbucket.net/leithian/">Leithian Script</a>, where Luthien thinks about her association with the mortal Beren:<br><br><i>Beren, you&#39;ve made me see time as a mortal woman does. It&#39;s been an hour already! How will I survive a day -- a week -- a year?</i><br><br>And that goes for Lethril as well. When all your companions are getting enthusiastic about the passing of a week, it&#39;s impossible to keep the mindset that anything less than ten years is a blink of an eye. So yes, Lethril will end up thinking in &#39;mortal time&#39;.<br><br>Another probability (also from the Leithian Script) is that she&#39;ll become somewhat addicted to mortals. It&#39;s their worldview! Lethril is 254 years old; she&#39;s seen virtually everything already, it&#39;s all a bit samey. But the girls at OFUM, they&#39;re seeing things for the first time. Lethril would never have looked at Legolas and thought &#39;wow, he&#39;s hot&#39; - she knows his grandfather, he&#39;s of her people, she&#39;s spent her life around people just as pretty as him, her built-in assumptions mean she doesn&#39;t bother to <i>look</i> - but now that her friends say it, she&#39;s looking, and she&#39;s liking what she sees. ^<em>^ And not just his hair, if you know what I mean.<br><br>Would Lethril come out of it with PTSD? Um, possibly from the teachers! If anything, she&#39;d end up with Stockholm Syndrome - her family back home would hardly recognise her!<br><br>Lethril is fairly heavily based on Finrod Felagund&#39;s mindset, I think. <i>He</i> ran into the Edain and shacked up with them for a while, and you can totally imagine him dressing in rough furs and getting into a drinking contest with Beor. But you could equally make her a Thranduil, isolationist and withdrawn - or a Caranthir. Pick a model and project them into that situation; if you know the character, you can work out their reactions from first principles.<br><br>hS<br><br>PS: And yes, she&#39;d love the stuffed toys. Menegroth was sculpted as a &#39;forest underground&#39; - stuffed animals are a way to do that <i>in every room!</i> What&#39;s not to like? ^</em>~</p>

            <p>I basically created the character to essentially spork the story he was created for.  A Viking/Barbarian from Generic Fantasy Land with no fourth wall.  He recognizes that the story might as well have been called Generic Fantasy Plot 1, decides his sole purpose is to correct a very bad story.  He finishes his arc by killing the very bad author.  It was part of an intentionally designed trunk story.  <br><br>Really, there is nothing wrong with the character himself, other than coming from a non-published universe.  Though his full awareness as a fictional character might be a bit much.  </p>

            <p>Non-published is perfectly fine - he&#39;d be a <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Semi-Fic_Blip">Semi-Fic Blip</a>. The meta awareness is probably the more problematic part, but it&#39;s not <i>inherently</i> bad - it&#39;s a thing that can be done well.</p>

            <p>I plan on writing a &quot;Next Generation&quot; fic, about James Potter II&#39;s first year at Hogwarts (and maybe expand it into a series, who knows). S, here&#39;s my question:<br><br>How do you guys feel about vampire students? Or, half-vampire (we know that&#39;s possible - Lorcan d&#39;Eath), because I felt like expanding the British folk tales into the Potter-verse. I know, it sounds bad - a PPC member messing around the canon universe, but I feel like up for a challenge. So, what is your opinion? Also, anyone willing to Beta it?</p>

            <p>You should remember that the one time we see a vampire on-page (Sanguini, in HBP), he had to be kept from eating some of Slughorn&#39;s partygoers. So while it&#39;s maybe possible to &#39;domesticate&#39; a vampire, it seems like they never quite loose their thirst.  <br><br>As for pointing to Lorcan as your canon example... I&#39;d hesitate to call that &#39;book canon&#39;, per se, since it&#39;s from the games and they have a different canon from the books and movies (thank Rowling). <br><br>Anything can be done well if handled right, but this is definitely a delicate thing you&#39;re playing with.  I&#39;m honestly quite a bit leery of the idea, but I&#39;ll reserve judgement until I see it.</p>

            <p>I never meant for any of my vampires (if I was to create them) to go on a bloodless diet. I was thinking about making a DADA teacher somehow connected to them (to make a reference to what Dean said in PoA when discussing who will be their next teacher, after Lupin), but I think this might be too much.<br><br>I think a safe way of doing this, is not making the character a full vampire but have them having a vampire somewhere in their ancestry. <br><br>As for Lorcan, he was featured on Rowling&#39;s site as November 2006&#39;s &quot;Wizard of the Month&quot;, so I guess we could count him as a canon, maybe?</p>

            <p>Honestly, I would use a program to custom make CGI models of my agents, but Star Trek Online is much faster, and almost as good. Seriously, it has the best character creator I&#39;ve seen. A screen shot, a little trip through Gimp, and I have a new agent picture. I&#39;ve done this professionally before, and I still do a little, but Star Trek Online would work really well if you don&#39;t have experience with things like Makehuman, Blender, or even Maya. I may discover a better method in time, and once figure it out, I&#39;ll share it.<br><br>Of course, if you want a 2d picture, Gimp is the best free option. If you have it or want it, either Coreldraw or Photoshop will work. If you are inexperienced, it is actually surprisingly easy with the latter two, to alter a photograph of a consenting friend, or yourself. It won&#39;t be perfect if you&#39;re really new, but you can go back later and make improvements once you&#39;re more experienced. Hope this wasn&#39;t too long winded or rambley.</p>

            <p>There&#39;s a lot of elements to it. There&#39;s a whole world with characters and backstory, which you can follow via comic strips. Some of the characters run shops you-the-user can visit to buy stuff for your avatar. You can also outfit a car, house, and aquarium. There are also games (like the puzzles I mentioned), which you can play to collect gold to spend on aforementioned design-y things. There&#39;s a thing where you can run around in the world and interact with other players, too, though it&#39;s fairly limited—or was the last time I poked my nose in. There are also forums for everything you can possibly imagine. I joined the site in the first place because some friends of mine were RPing there. (Posting also earns you gold.) Then there are the special site-wide events, which are occasionally really cool, such as the one where they created their own version of <i>Oregon Trail</i>. Playing them generally gets you special limited-edition avatar items.<br><br>... Basically, it&#39;s a huge, elaborate time-waster. ^_^; But mostly harmless, and sometimes really fun.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I don&#39;t think anyone&#39;s properly explained this here yet, so I might as well. Although our purpose is to poke fun at bad fanfiction and promote good fanfiction, as well as support each other as writers within the community… requests really depend entirely on whether someone wants to do it or not. And we&#39;re also reeeeally much heavier on the community/goodfic parts of the mission than the &quot;finding badfic&quot; bits.<br><br>That in mind, please keep all &quot;badfic requests&quot; to one thread. This is fine, and you&#39;re doing well at keeping it contained, but since you&#39;re new, I want to make sure someone lets you know so it doesn&#39;t come up later: if there&#39;s already a badfic thread on the front page we <i>highly</i> encourage everyone to post their badfic stuff there. </p>

            <p>and the Puritanical standards I have, do you think &quot;Suedom&quot; would be an okay read for me? It looks interesting and fun, but it&#39;s rated PG-13, and that rating seems to encompass a lot more in literature than in film. Also, I didn&#39;t really mention before, but I&#39;m a bit like Agent Supernumerary when it comes to romantic stuffs. I&#39;m more relaxed, but I don&#39;t like it that much. So. &quot;Suedom&quot;- yay or nay?</p>

            <p>There&#39;s a couple of curses right at the beginning of chapter 1, but the character doing it isn&#39;t someone we see again (I don&#39;t think). Uhm... ultimately, it&#39;s been too long since I read it. I suggest trying Chapter 1, (not the prologue), ignoring those first couple, and seeing how you find it. I <i>will</i> say that it&#39;s a cracking good read, even if unfinished.<br><br>(And isn&#39;t romantic, from memory. Though who knows?

            <p>totally off of the topic, but why worry? Anyway, if Elves are so fascinated by language- why don&#39;t they know them all? I mean, we have clear proof that not every Elf can even speak the Common Tongue, let alone different strains of Elvish. Perhaps I&#39;m misremembering, and they don&#39;t actually have a &#39;thing&#39; for languages, but I seem to recall such a thing being mentioned. </p>

            <p>But obviously it still varies within the species - I mean, humans have a &#39;thing&#39; for, oh, let&#39;s go with telling stories - but some people do it much more, or much better, than others.<br><br>We know that the Noldor learnt Sindarin very quickly - they were speaking it by the time they had the Feast of Reuniting, when Maedhros was rescued. But they&#39;re a kind of biased sample - the &#39;Deep Elves&#39; are all about wisdom and knowledge. The other races don&#39;t focus on it so much.<br><br>We also know that the Galadhrim don&#39;t all speak Westron, and that most elves don&#39;t speak Quenya. That&#39;s probably for the same reason: why <i>would</i> they? Quenya is a dead language in Middle-earth from... er... the moment Thingol found out about the Kinslaying. Westron isn&#39;t spoken in Lorien.<br><br>Elves are good at languages, and as a general comment, they enjoy learning them. But that doesn&#39;t mean every elf does.<br><br>hS<br><br>(PS: Also, cultural reasons. An elf of Doriath wouldn&#39;t learn Quenya, because their king banned it, for instance.)</p>

            <p>So, I remembered a Cats the Musical fic I&#39;d found long ago and re-found it.<br><br><a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6307523/1/How-I-met-the-Jellicles"><a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6307523/1/How-I-met-the-Jellicles">https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6307523/1/How-I-met-the-Jellicles</a></a><br><br>I&#39;m re-reading it and I&#39;m speechless. I vote that this one goes to the Unclaimed Badfic section.<br><br>She says in an author&#39;s note that &quot;in this story, Cats the Musical doesn&#39;t exist.&quot; That&#39;s like writing a Harry Potter fanfic and then saying Harry Potter doesn&#39;t exist.<br><br>She and her Lust Object (Mungojerrie) fall in love with each other instantly. Then it&#39;s implied they have sex, and she says she never wants to go back home. She whines about how she&#39;s always bullied at school, even though we only see some name-calling. An author&#39;s note reveals that the making-out scene was dreamt. Remind you of anyone?<br><br>She calls the Rum Tum Tugger messed up. TUGGER. Excuse me, but he&#39;s supposed to be the flirtatious heartthrob. That&#39;s his role!<br><br>Mungojerrie is bent horribly into OOCness.<br><br>None of the Jellicle Tribe do a thing when Macavity shows up.<br><br>And.... SHE AND MUNGOJERRIE DO THE PAX DE DUES!!!! As any fan knows, this duet dance is done by Plato (who is rarely switched out for another sometimes) and Victoria. It&#39;s an important part in the Ball Dance. The queen in the dance is always Victoria, no ifs ands or buts!!!</p>

            <p>I couldn&#39;t even get past the author&#39;s note. The fact that this author would make up names instead of looking towards the book of poems that CATS is based off of makes me very upset. The first poem is literally about naming cats and has a butt ton of names that fit in with the rhyme and rhythm scheme that the rest of the names follow.</p>

            <p>She&#39;s using common nicknames that the Musical fans use for the characters. It&#39;s done all the time. So, technically, it&#39;s not wrong. Names like &quot;Mungo,&quot; &quot;Jelly&quot; and &quot;Pounce&quot; are fan-bestowed nicknames. It&#39;s a shortening of their full names. &quot;Although Rumpleteazer is more known by the nickname &quot;Teazer,&quot; not &quot;Rumple.&quot; But maybe I&#39;m wrong in saying that&#39;s what you&#39;re thinking of?<br><br>But Munkustrap… Poor Munkustrap… He gets mad for no reason and slaps her. MUNKUSTRAP DOES NOT HIT QUEENS. I am glad he hit her, though. And Tugger keeps trying to flirt with her, even though she clearly refused him. Tugger doesn&#39;t flirt with those who clearly don&#39;t like him. Take Demeter or Jennyanydots, for example. Poor Tugger…<br><br>This one&#39;s on my sparking list for the future. *evil smile*</p>

            <p>Seriously, I see this all the time. I have so many computers, one of them is bound to be doing this at any given time. It&#39;s not really dangerous, just annoying, and I have a possible fix. I use chrome, and I get this in chrome. It does not appear to be present in Chrome Canary, which is basically just the dev version. You can download and use it even if you&#39;re not a dev, and it&#39;s not as horribly unstable as you might believe, so give it a shot if this is an unbearable problem.</p>

            <p>...I think in French. There&#39;s a rigid masculine/feminine division in how you structure your sentences so my brain went : <i>un lapin</i> --&gt; masculine noun --&gt; pronoun in text is &quot;hir&quot; --&gt; correct to &quot;his&quot;. <br><br>Come to think of it, there&#39;s no framework in place in the French language if someone wants to adopt nonstandard pronouns: you always check if the person identifies as male or female.

            <p>Anyone can use it if they know the Voice, like the Greybeards and the ancient Nordic heroes who created it. The exception is dragons themselves; the concepts it embodies are so alien to dragons that they can&#39;t project them. Also, the Last Dragonborn isn&#39;t the only Dragonborn.<br>And I thought of something else: <i>wish</i>. The D&amp;D spell, that is. It lets you literally rewrite reality. There&#39;s a creature - the tarrasque - that can regenerate itself from being <i>disintegrated</i> into its constituent atoms. <i>Wish</i> is the only thing that can put it down, and only then if it&#39;s as close to dead as it can otherwise get. Its resilience sounds a bit like what that elixir you&#39;re talking about grants.<br>If even that doesn&#39;t suit you (because of the different rules governing various continua), there&#39;s this other nice little thing called <i>soul bind</i>. You said that the elixir prevents its drinker&#39;s soul/body/whatever from being confined to the underworld/afterlife/whatever... but nothing about it not being able to be confined in a gemstone. It&#39;s basically a magical alternative to sticking her in a black hole - there is no escape.</p>

            <p>Well, probably.

            <p>Black holes, realistic ones at least, probably would work. Even if they wouldn&#39;t kill the Sue, she wouldn&#39;t be bothering anyone again. This happens for several reasons:<br><br>First, the Event Horizon. Absolutely nothing escapes once it&#39;s past the Horizon, not even light (that&#39;s why they&#39;re called black holes). The Sue sure wouldn&#39;t be able to.<br><br>Second, any realistic black hole has insane time dilation. Even if, by some miracle, the Sue did manage to escape, it would be in the far future (how far depends on how massive the black hole is). <br><br>Third, there&#39;s this Fun thing called Spaghettification (I&#39;m not kidding, that&#39;s its actual name) that happens when you get too close to black holes. Spaghettification is when tidal gravity (the difference in gravity between your top and bottom) rip you apart. And then it happens again, and again, and again, until you&#39;re a cloud of disconnected atoms. Meanwhile, you&#39;re being squeezed into a tube of matter resembling a spaghetti noodle (hence the name). Even if the Sue had drunk the Hourai Elixir, this would happen to her. Heck, because she wouldn&#39;t be able to stop falling into the black hole, it would happen to her continuously. <br><br>One of the few ways this wouldn&#39;t work would be if it was banned as torture. Black holes are a very, very thorough way of killing stuff. </p>

The point is that this isn’t just a sample. If you don’t decide to redo it and give your agents a different back story, it is the prologue to your spin-off and should be linked on your agents’ wiki pages (which should be based on your agent profiles).

            <p>Shapeshifting has been shown to be canonically possible, so long has one has a Maia for an ancestor. Sure, it&#39;s rare for it to happen, but if one really wanted a character like that, change the fate of Elered and Elurin. They live, have children, boom. There&#39;s your Maia ancestry, through Melian.<br><br>Animal friends.. Dealing with the assumption that our OC is an Elf, not too difficult. Elves are shown to be very, very good with animals. He&#39;s got Maia blood to boot, and he&#39;s related to Beren through Dior. Animal friends aren&#39;t very surprising at all. <br><br> Magic jewelry really isn&#39;t all that hard- after all, Saruman made some rings which we know nothing of, and there are the &quot;essays into the craft&quot; that I can&#39;t remember anything else about. I&#39;m actually hoping to mention them (maybe involve them) in my Tenth Walker story. <br><br>Psychic? Well, why not? Galadriel and her family can do it (as far as I can recall). It&#39;s not too far a jump to think that others from Aman might be able to. Heck, it makes me think that if an Elf were powerful enough, he could do it without being from Aman- slap one of the unknown rings on his finger, say it increases the strength of his mind, and boom. Psychic. <br><br>Now, can all of this be woven into a &quot;good&quot; story? I think so. The hardest part might be coming up with a reason for our OC to stay in Middle-earth, rather than leaving for Aman. There&#39;d also be the issues of what he would do during the War, who he would lead, who he might follow, and all of that. But I think it could be done.</p>

            <p>Though I&#39;m tempted to get the shapeshifting direct from the source - what <i>would</i> a vampire look like when not in bat-form?

            <p>(Also, of course, Beorn can shapeshift, without even being an elf!)<br><br>&#39;Werewolf&#39; is a bit of a misnomer; Tolkien seems to have used it synonymously with &#39;warg&#39;, and with &#39;wild wolf&#39; and &#39;great wolf&#39;. Basically, think &#39;intelligent Dire Wolf&#39; and you won&#39;t be far wrong. Sauron aside, there&#39;s no evidence they could shapeshift. And what happened to them? Nothing! They&#39;re still around in the Third Age, teaming up with the goblins to sing songs about fir trees. ^_^<br><br>Vampires... well, it&#39;s difficult, since the only two we ever hear about are Sauron (again, shapeshifting) and Thuringwethil - who&#39;s already dead by the time her name comes up! It&#39;s pretty clear that they&#39;re messengers of Morgoth, and that Sauron keeps a few on hand in both Tol-in-Gaurhoth, and when he holed up in the Nightshade.<br><br>It&#39;s also clearer than I said that they <i>could</i> shapeshift. Sauron turned into the &#39;giant bat&#39; form, but Morgoth wasn&#39;t surprised to see Luthien in a form that could speak, and stand in front of him - <i>not</i> a giant bat, in other words.<br><br>So what happened to them? They may have all died in the War of Wrath - they weren&#39;t fighters, after all. Or... well, there <i>is</i> an army of giant bats in <i>The Hobbit</i>, and the movies definitely didn&#39;t show them as ordinary bats. Given that Tolkien ripped the setting off <i>The Hobbit</i> right out of his Silm manuscripts (check out the dwarf-hating Elvenking in his underground city!), I suspect they&#39;re actually bat-form vampires. Perhaps, with Morgoth gone, they can no longer look human - that would make a certain amount of sense.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Finrod killed him to protect Beren, remember? And then the Lady Luthien dropped a castle on his corpse. He&#39;s <i>very</i> dead.<br><br>It&#39;s fairly clear that a bunch of Melkor&#39;s abominations are long-lived. Draugluin, &#39;Father of Werewolves&#39;, is around in the late 460s, but it&#39;s hard to imagine werewolves don&#39;t date back to the very early days of the War. Dragons and balrogs are both immortal-in-the-Elvish-mode.

            <p>As ever (or more so than ever): this is speculative. We know virtually nothing about vampires specifically. But...<br><br>-They were probably born. Morgoth&#39;s usual process (or rather, Sauron&#39;s, since he was apparently the one who created orcs - and werewolves) seems to have been:<br>--Make the first of a species by twisting something natural. Orcs are twisted elves. Trolls are, according to Fangorn, twisted Ents. Werewolves are presumably twisted wolves.<br>--Engage in an aggressive magical breeding program. This is how Draugluin gave rise to Carcharoth.<br>--Let them just keep breeding. We know that orcs, for instance, bred in the Misty Mountains.<br><br>There is an alternate scheme: the one used for creating dragons. It goes:<br><br>-Make a body out of inanimate matter.<br>-Persuade a Maia to run it for you.<br><br>This probably doesn&#39;t make something that can reproduce. We&#39;ve no indication that dragons could breed, and very strong indications that balrogs <i>couldn&#39;t</i>.<br><br>So why do I say vampires are probably the former, rather than the latter? Simple: they&#39;re based on bats. Balrogs and dragons are only <a href="http://huinesoron.webs.com/Netilardo/Theory9.htm">loosely based on other creatures</a>; vampires are pretty obviously corrupted bats. So they were born.<br><br>But, as I&#39;ve said somewhere else, the &#39;born&#39; method involves sticking a little bit of Melkor&#39;s essence inside the creatures in question. This is apparently hereditary (which might mean that Morgoth grew more powerful as his armies grew, which would figure). But it also has the effect of making his creatures Default Evil.<br><br>Think of it as having a little Shoulder Morgoth (there&#39;s an image for you...!). Does it make you necessarily evil? No. But it means your primary drives are going to be <i>selfish</i>, and quite possibly power-hungry. Can someone who&#39;s predisposed to see themselves as the most important person in the world (except for the Master, of course) be good?<br><br>Well... that sounds like a story in the making!<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>a passage saying that the plainest to the north of the Lonely Mountain were the breeding grounds of dragons, though.

But it&#39;s talking about the motivations of Orcs, and how they live in fear of Sauron and hate for him, and hate for themselves, and hate for everything less pitiable than they are. And that makes me think of the scene in the movies, when Aragorn falls off the cliff, and Legolas speaks to the Orc. The Orc is holding the Evenstar so gently- he&#39;s cupping it, really, like it&#39;s the most precious thing he&#39;s ever seen. And I can&#39;t help but wonder if whatever tiny bit of Elf that might still have been in him longed for beauty again.<br><br>Ahem. Anyway, yes, that does sound like a good story! </p>

            <p>Even more clearly, in a draft manuscript somewhere, Gloin apparently mentions &#39;a dragonet new from the shell&#39;.<br><br>But that doesn&#39;t mean that they breed like normal creatures do. I&#39;m now picturing a dragon melting together a vast horde of metals into a ball, then heating it still further so that some of the dragon&#39;s own innate fire passes into the &#39;egg&#39;. The fire-spirit in the centre of the &#39;egg&#39; would then work its way outwards, building itself a body from the metals around it; finally it would break through the last shell of metal, and emerge as a young dragon.<br><br>(All this assumes that you take the 1917 descriptions of dragons as mechanical as canon, rather than just reading them as mutant lizards or something.)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>... is Tolkien talking about the fact that the elves touch the world only lightly, and by the Third Age were already withdrawing from relevance:<br><br><i>Legolas probably achieved the least of the Nine Walkers...</i><br><br>^_~<br><br>Though, of course, it must be said: Legolas, not that good?

            <p>I&#39;ve seen sporkings where the fic in question was too long, so the agents would go and portal to certain spots to take care of the really bad spots. I have a feeling I might need to do that. So what&#39;s a good rule of thumb for knowing when you need to do that.

            <p>1) You have to develop your own rules of thumbs for that. If you want to see what other people did, most people link to the badfic they sporked, so you can look at the mission and the badfic side-by-side and see what they did. It changes from person to person and from mission to mission.<br>2) <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Posting_New_Mission_Reports">Wiki has an article on that.</a><br>3) Have you tried signing in to another Wikias? If you can&#39;t sign into any Wikia, it&#39;s probably a problem to be solved with Wikia itself. If it&#39;s just the PPC Wiki that gives you problems, you should poke the Wiki admins to see if you&#39;re caught in a ban by mistake.<br>4) Of course. Post a beta request on the Board and <i>someone</i> will answer it, 99.99% of the time.</p>

            <p>Possession shouldn&#39;t be confused with plain old OOCness. Possession usually implies a Sue- or slash-wraith, which respectively make the character behave in a Sueish or slashy way. If they&#39;re OOC but not particularly Sueish or slashy, or if there&#39;s already a Sue in the fic to blame for characterization issues, possession is not likely.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>In theory, a possessed character is being forced to do things they wouldn&#39;t normally do because a wraith is making them, but they&#39;re still more or less recognizable as themselves. Sometimes more, sometimes a lot less.<br><br>A replacement, on the other hand, is what you get when you surgically remove the defining things that make that character who they are and replace them with BS. I always look for a name-change to seal the deal, too. If they can&#39;t even claim to be the same character in name anymore, that&#39;s a wrap: they&#39;ve been replaced. See <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Archir_the_Emerald">Archir the Emerald</a>, for example, who was originally supposed to be Harry Potter. Other examples from my missions include Severus &quot;Sithchean Bran&quot; Snape from <a href="http://starshadowhall.tripod.com/ppc/rc999/01ft.html">&quot;Family Ties&quot;</a> and Hermione &quot;Nadia&quot; Lupin-Black (or whatever) from <a href="http://starshadowhall.tripod.com/ppc/rc999/03hpdrop.html">&quot;Harry Potter and the Dragonriders of Pern.&quot;</a> I could&#39;ve gone the same route with Ginny in that mission, but although she was pretty speshul, she wasn&#39;t <i>too</i> horribly OOC motive-wise, her name didn&#39;t change, and her backstory was still intact, so I just had her be possessed.<br><br>Unfortunately, what seems to happen in practice a lot of the time is that a writer just wants to kill or recruit something, so they declare it to be a character replacement. It&#39;s annoying. Please strive to avoid doing this.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I found out about this fiction universe on TV Tropes, much to my excitement. It seems just like my sense of humor. I&#39;ve read a few of the original series and painstakingly went over the FAQs.<br><br>I&#39;m a bit intimidated by this community, I have to admit. There seems to be such a tangle of inside jokes, history, etc... that just joining looks like it takes a lot of preparation. <br><br>But the main draw is my enthusiasm for fanfiction! I hate that people think fanfic will automatically be bad, and thus give the free excuse of &quot;eh, it&#39;s fanfiction&quot; whenever someone writes something terrible using the medium.<br><br>Aside from that, I mostly write for the Hetalia fandom and Elder Scrolls.</p>

            <p>There&#39;s something about the way that Kala thinks, during her narration, about Valon, especially right after he became Valerie.<br>If you were to change it, try having Valon not change (the fic itself was pretty short and having Valon become Valerie outshone the mission in some scenes) or having both Kala and Valerie change.<br></p>

            <p><br>Alloy and Ginger in the Department of Mary Sues. Neither have very good wiki articles yet, but here they are: <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Alloy"><a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Alloy">http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Alloy</a></a> and <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Ginger-Wise"><a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Ginger-Wise">http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Ginger-Wise</a></a> . Since I don&#39;t have their backgrounds up, as I am a silly person who keeps forgetting, here is a small amount of background:<br><br>Alloy was a bit character in a badfic who had a problem with hardening eyes. She doesn&#39;t use contractions -- a habit that annoys Ginger quite a bit. Due to a typo, her hair is made of the same material as the American dollar, though it lacks the printing. She tries to be upbeat most of the time, but often ends up confused instead. The badfic hasn&#39;t really worn her down yet, though, even though their first mission was an utter disaster that required intervention by another agent. <br><br>Ginger-Wise was a Hermione replacement, rescued by Rina. Her personality hasn&#39;t quite settled yet, but she&#39;s basically settled into a state of resigned annoyance. She&#39;s also a bit more into appearance than practical, and is, in general, hard to get along with. Of the two, Ginger tends to end up being the leader; annoyance tends to move one to action more than confusion. She also has a weapon that she took from a Stu -- in &quot;Dawn&#39;s&quot; Stu-wielded state, it was a chainsword/gun, possibly crossing over from the Warhammer 40k continuum. With Ginger, who isn&#39;t a native of RWBY, it&#39;s mostly a gun with too much purple on it and an annoying tendency to slice things at inopportune times. <br><br>((Not that I think that they&#39;ll get many questions, but...))</p>

            <p>&quot;Actually my strength isn&#39;t derived from raw power in the same way that Mr. Incredible&#39;s is. It&#39;s momentum-based, meaning I&#39;d have to get my body moving for any real impact. THAT SAID, though, I&#39;ve accidentally hit my teammates a bit TOO hard every so often, which is why people get uncomfortable when I try to shoulder-punch them nowadays lest I send them through a wall or two! So the short answer to your question would be a solid yes. Unfortunately. I&#39;m amazed it hasn&#39;t happened to Cupid or Lapis yet, but time will tell...&quot;</p>

            <p>Medical was specifically against the replacement hand until further notice. They were afraid that any residual glitter from my, uh, mishap from my fourth mission would get into any hypothetical cybernetic implants that I end up getting, and I&#39;m not sure if they&#39;ll be able to get rid of it completely. I&#39;ll probably go back to Medical after a few missions with my current prosthetics and reevaluate my physical state. If they revise their prognosis so that I can get a new hand in the future, though, I&#39;d be more than happy to take up your offer - especially because I&#39;ve been meaning to sample Avatar-verse jasmine tea!</p>

So maybe we could have Shui-Hua hold Lapis up, this argument happens, my agents make up with Shiu-Hua, and head off to help out the other team. And THEN Lapis has to head over to FicPsych after that mission and... well... we&#39;ll see how it turns out! :D)</p>

            <p><i>For Falchion, (and Velociripper): What&#39;s it like being an author avatar?</i><br><br>[Ripper:] &quot;Horrible.&quot;<br>[Falchion:] &quot;Dude, no.&quot;<br>[Ripper:] &quot;Your author used me as a tool to inflict grievous harm on multiple canons, both mentally and physically. I haven&#39;t forgotten that.&quot;<br>[Rashida:] &quot;Please don&#39;t, you two.&quot;<br>[Falchion:] &quot;But being an author&#39;s persona isn&#39;t all about seeing their past mistakes, Ripper. If I hadn&#39;t looked up my history and the history of my author, I wouldn&#39;t have had a clue as to how to complete my first mission. And I certainly wouldn&#39;t be in most of the fandoms that I&#39;m in today.&quot;<br>[Rashida:] &quot;Fair points, but that doesn&#39;t change the fact that your author made such an ass out of himself back then.&quot;<br>[Falchion:] &quot;Rosie, we&#39;ve all been like that at some point. Well, our authors have, anyway.&quot;<br>[Rashida and Ripper:] &quot;True.&quot;<br><br><i>For all of RC #333: How&#39;s Lapis doing? Is she OK?</i><br>[Lapis:] &quot;Oh, I&#39;m perfectly fine... if it weren&#39;t for the fact that I, oh, lost my right hand AND my ability to teleport!&quot;<br>[Sarah:] &quot;Lapis, it was for your own good. If you&#39;d kept those plot holes, who knows what would happen next time?&quot;<br>[Cupid:] &quot;Don&#39;t forget that without my intervention, there wouldn&#39;t BE a next time!&quot;<br>[Lapis:] *sweatdrops* &quot;You drunk-drove that Super Truck into the DoSAT. How can you call that intervention?&quot;<br>[Cupid:] &quot;I wonder what anime sweatdrops taste like?&quot;<br>[Sarah:] &quot;Cupid, stop it. Anyway, we&#39;re working on getting some prosthetics taken care of for Blue-Hair, since the lack of a hand would be an OBVIOUS hindrance to missions and the like. But we can&#39;t risk a permanent replacement, even a mechanical one. What if there was some residual glitter and it got inside?&quot;<br>[Lapis:] &quot;You took the words right out of my mouth, Sarah...&quot;<br>[Cupid:] &quot;You know, I think we should see <i>Mad Max: Fury Road</i>. From what I&#39;ve heard, there&#39;s a major character in that movie that I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll relate to.&quot;<br>[Lapis:] &quot;I&#39;d be willing to, if it weren&#39;t for two things. First, that movie is rated R, and I&#39;m TWELVE. And second, if we get sent into a mission involving the <i>Mad Max</i> continuum, it&#39;ll be your fault.&quot;<br>[Cupid:] &quot;Um, oops? Sorry, Lapis!&quot;<br><br><i>For Salvo: What&#39;s Intelligence like? What do you guys do?</i><br>[Salvo:] &quot;Oh, Intelligence? Pff, don&#39;t get me started. It&#39;s difficult, for a start, to move around in a badfic and not get noticed by the Sue in question. Especially when you&#39;re in a disguise in which you can&#39;t move in total silence, which is basically most of the disguises I have to pick when I&#39;m sent in. We also have to endure the ENTIRE badfic in order to determine whether it&#39;s missionable or not. Not the easiest way of handling things. Lastly, there&#39;s the matter of the folks Upstairs sending missions to agents in action departments. I&#39;m always worried that I&#39;d submit an Intelligence report only to have it sent to the team who rescued me, because it would come off as being ungrateful. But hey, I&#39;m not the one who takes care of who does what. So please, direct your complaints to the Flowers and not us if you&#39;re not happy about what you&#39;re supposed to do!&quot;</p>

            <p>[Ripper:] &quot;For some of us, the PPC is our only home. We have no where else to go. So that means that being an agent at least gives us a chance to exist, to hunt, and to have posterity if we&#39;re lucky. It isn&#39;t an ideal habitat, to be fair, but being able to live my own life is more than I can ask for. I&#39;m sure most of us would agree - even if some won&#39;t admit it.&quot;<br>[Sarah:] &quot;I still hate you.&quot;<br>[Falchion:] &quot;Yeah, well, we also get to meet a lot of new friends, and in due course patch up the old wounds in our relationships with our authors.&quot;<br>[Rashida:] &quot;Assuming we HAVE authors, that is...&quot;<br>[Falchion:] &quot;And if we get to meet anyone from the same places we originated, we can have the time to make up for the rough times we went through with them.&quot;<br>[Rayner:] &quot;I still have to question your choice to live with the guy who tried to murder your adopted sister, Falco...&quot;<br>[E.V.L.] &quot;This, coming from the person who tried to kill me and accidentally set up our life-bond? I see no perks. It&#39;s either being here or not existing at all.&quot;<br>[Cupid:] &quot;Oh, c&#39;mon, it&#39;s not the worst place to be in! They have the best wine in the multiverse, after all!&quot;<br>[Alexander:] &quot;But knowing your habits, it&#39;s lucky that angels don&#39;t have to worry about the risk of alcohol poisoning.&quot;<br>[Lapis:] &quot;I&#39;m not worried about that! If he gets drunk on the job, who knows what&#39;ll happen?&quot;<br>[Sarah:] &quot;It&#39;s not like he&#39;s never gotten drunk before. Remember our first mission?&quot;<br>[Lapis:] &quot;What, the one where Cupid pissed off Yveltal?&quot;<br>[Cupid:] &quot;It was NECESSARY! There was an entire Suvian army and I couldn&#39;t just pick them off one by one!&quot;<br>[Salvo:] &quot;Yes, but was bringing in the entire roster of newcomers for the fourth Smash Bros. really necessary?&quot;<br>[Cupid:] &quot;...No?&quot;<br>[Salvo:] *sighs* &quot;Didn&#39;t think so.&quot;<br>*beat*<br>[Falchion:] &quot;Well... that escalated quickly.&quot;<br>[Rashida:] &quot;Oh, shut up.&quot;</p>

            <p>[Falchion:] &quot;My first mission, full stop. And too many times since then.&quot;<br>[Rashida:] &quot;That&#39;s your response every time anyone asks that. I don&#39;t consider that mission to be worth the extra effort - and I certainly didn&#39;t like the fact that it was ridiculously long, even by our standards.&quot;<br>[Sarah:] &quot;Oh, c&#39;mon! If it weren&#39;t for Adam&#39;s help, I wouldn&#39;t even be here. But then again, neither would Ripper...&quot;<br>[Ripper:] &quot;I&#39;ll pretend I didn&#39;t hear that.&quot;<br>[Sarah:] &quot;As for me, I&#39;d say the mission that led to Cupid&#39;s recruitment was probably the big one for me. It&#39;s not every day that you get to befriend a Sue-wraith, let alone recruit one. It just goes to show that sometimes a story CAN be redeemed if you change up a few things about it.&quot;<br>[Rayner:] &quot;But it wasn&#39;t consistent with the canon. How hard is it to understand that?&quot;<br>[Cupid:] &quot;We know that already! It&#39;s just that they didn&#39;t think I was completely hopeless, and knowing them, that&#39;s a pretty big deal.&quot;<br>[E.V.L.] &quot;Count yourself lucky. I&#39;m only here because Pony Boy just had to make an ass out of himself...&quot;<br>[Rayner:] *facepalm* &quot;You HAD to bring that up, didn&#39;t you?&quot;</p>

Water, fresh fish when we can get it, dragon kibble when we can&#39;t (and yes that is a thing, I know, surprised me, too); regular exercise that sadly doesn&#39;t involve nearly enough terrorizing of Sues and new recruits; taking him out to do his business so we don&#39;t end up with piles of glowing green dung in the RC; eck cetra.<br><br>Oh, and FYI, updated from last time, <i>Skyrim</i> is basically Vikings and therefore kicks all kinds of butt. Also the show <i>Vikings</i>, though it&#39;s this weird AU (I guess) where there&#39;s no dragons and it&#39;s all, like, seriously grim and creepy sometimes.

            <p>Hello, Iximaz. I am composing the answers to your questions for both of us. Nume does not admit to wanting to have anything to do with this exercise, although I suspect he is more intrigued by the questions than he lets on.<br><br>We actually got into quite the discussion about your first question, but in the end we agreed it&#39;s best not to answer it. We fear that if we name any particular crossover, a badfic of it is sure to exist, whether or not it did before, and will then be sent to our console. In general terms, however, continua that have vastly differing tones and physical laws—say a silly children&#39;s cartoon and a hard sci-fi drama—would be particularly difficult to reconcile.<br><br>Nume says that he answered your second question the last time we answered letters. (He expressed this with more colorful language that I have chosen to omit.) I&#39;ll quote his previous response here: &quot;Giving credit where it&#39;s due, Picard is the least terrible [of all the captains]. Kirk is Kirk, but I never liked him much. Don&#39;t see the appeal.&quot;<br><br>Agent Farilan? No, I don&#39;t believe I know anyone by that name. Should I?</p>

            <p>I had no idea there were any other Andalites here besides Agent Iskillion and myself. Have you been here long? When did you arrive? How did you come to find yourself here?<br><br>And... please excuse me, I know this is an unforgivable string of foolish questions already, but... you&#39;re a female? I had nearly come to believe I would never meet a female of my own species.

            <p>For one thing, I understand there have historically been far more female recruits than male, so if the organization limited itself to male action agents, it would be even more pitifully understaffed than it is anyway. It would not serve the cause well to do so.<br><br>For another, the PPC is run by sentient plants, which may or may not recognize biological sex as a matter of any importance at all.<br><br>Furthermore, while the males of many species do tend to be larger and stronger on average, none of the sentient species I&#39;m aware of have a significant difference in intelligence between males and females. This work does not demand physical prowess, but rather intelligence and passion, so females and males are equally capable of serving.<br><br>Of course, that&#39;s to say nothing of the full spectrum of sexes and gender identities, which is not binary at all. Some species, including humans, acknowledge a wide range of genders, and some have none at all!<br><br>I theorize that Andalite society would be less rigid in this matter if it were not for the inescapable difference in tail-blade size between males and females. A big male with a large tail-blade is simply better suited to tail-fighting—if we were all born alike, our society would never have invented such a division. I further theorize, however, that some females must be larger than others, and some males smaller (with tail-blades to match), just like every other species. In such a case, would a large female not be just as suited as a male to become a warrior, and would not a small male find he is more suited to the arts or sciences?<br><br>In closing, I believe this is a quotation, though I regret I cannot recall the source: &quot;<i>Allow</i> them? Just try <i>stopping</i> them!&quot;<br><br>(( Oops, he took her at face value. He&#39;s so helpful, isn&#39;t he? {= D He&#39;s clearly been talking to Jenni about some things.

            <p>Sorry. {= (<br><br>Yeah, it&#39;s tough getting into the head of a character you disagree with. Especially since we don&#39;t really know all that much about Andalite society, all things considered. I mean, <i>do</i> they have the same kinds of variations in sex/gender as humans?

            <p>Yes, rampancy is indeed a most pressing issue, especially as I enter what could be my last operational year. DoSAT is indeed looking into it, as is my own DIAU. I&#39;m sorry to say that results so far have been unproductive. Attempting to meld technologies from different fandoms -- in my case, the <i>Halo</i>verse with anything else -- tends to create more problems than it fixes.

            <p>Gremlin here. Xericka&#39;s standing right behind me reading everything I write, so I suppose she is also technically here.<br><br>It&#39;s hard to say what the best thing that happened to me is. I&#39;ve seen plenty of both good and bad. Maybe meeting Xericka? Hanging with her 24/7 is way better than a night of breaking and entering. She&#39;s surprisingly cool. (She audibly scoffed at that, by the way. And now she is telling me not to write that she scoffed. Or that she told me not to write that. And now she&#39;s glaring at me. I should probably move on.)<br><br>Xericka says the best thing that happened to her was adopting Aiden. I can&#39;t argue with that. He&#39;s adorable. Plus, Xericka makes a pretty good mom. (She just told me to stop issuing her bald-faced comments. Whatever.)<br><br>As for what we&#39;ve been up to, we&#39;ve been plenty busy. Just because you haven&#39;t heard about us running missions doesn&#39;t mean we haven&#39;t. If our feats of awesomeness haven&#39;t been getting any publicity, blame the archivists. I hear that job has a lot of churn. People going nuts and whatever.<br><br>Even when we&#39;re not on missions, we keep busy. Taking care of Aiden. Drinking to forget. Causing ruckuses. Ask around a bit more; you might hear a little something.<br><br>Xericka wants me to add that it&#39;s me who causes ruckuses, not her. She&#39;s being modest.<br><br>Now she&#39;s glaring at me again. Gotta dash.</p>

She was rescued from a badfic - an OC bit like me - and she was put in a wheelchair and just kinda left there &#39;cause the only reason she existed was to prove how sweet and kind the Sue was. She&#39;s pretty much nonverbal and she&#39;s almost totally unable to function, but she... she draws, and paints, and she enjoys that, and she&#39;s happy here. We think. Asking an AAT sufferer what kinda gadgets they wanna use is kinda like asking Stacie what her favourite dance steps are. It&#39;s, um, it&#39;s pretty insensitive.

Indeed, I may be able to help you right now...&quot; The Notary scribbled down some complicated-looking strings of numbers. &quot;These are the forms you will require for a personal effects requisition from an Internal Affairs operative.

            <p>Oooh, but that boy knew how to treat a lady right.<br><br>She focussed her brain, quite violently, and when her ears stopped ringing from the slap she sat down and filed the forms. They were, true to his word, absolutely perfect, and there was a frisson of excitement about her as her plan kicked in.<br><br>Later that evening, one of the DIA internal security devices activated, and the Guardsman&#39;s laser screwdriver vanished with a small pop as the miniature hyperspace motivator activated. A few seconds later, it was replaced with an IOU in a travel tube and details of how to get a temporary replacement until another Insert Agent Item Here could be made permanently available.<br><br>Then the next set of Circumstance forms kicked in, and the screwdriver made its way steadily to DoSAT and Alex Dives. This was where the Notary shone; at the stroke of a pen, so to speak, the paper trail became thoroughly occluded. You&#39;d have more chance of untangling where mob profits wound up than finding the device if you used the paper trail alone. Of course, this wasn&#39;t a perfect plan, if one used detective work, but it gave enough time for Dives to have his fun.<br><br>She tracked it indirectly, through the ripples it made in the formsphere, and when it arrived at DoSAT she punched the air and resolved to buy the human something tasteful. Some flowers, perhaps, properly arranged.<br><br>The look on the Grunt&#39;s face was going to be <i>priceless</i>.</p>

            <p>&quot;WHERE IS IT?&quot; he bellowed to nobody in particular. &quot;MY SCREWDRIVER! IT&#39;S GONE! AND THEN THERE&#39;S THIS NOTE ABOUT HOW TO GET A FRIGGIN&#39; REPLACEMENT!

We can trace the recall tag--&quot;<br><br>&quot;NO WE CAN&#39;T!&quot; yelled back the Guardsman, rifling though another desk drawer. &quot;<i>SHE</i> DID THIS! SHE KNOWS HOW TO MAKE THINGS DISAPPEAR! I&#39;M NEVER GOING TO SEE IT AGAIN!&quot; He paused to wipe his tears with his sleeve and violently kicked his workbench. &quot;GOD DAMN IT! SHE JUST TAKES THINGS AWAY FROM YOU AND YOU CAN&#39;T DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT! ALL OF THIS BECAUSE I COMMENTED ON A PICTURE! A PICTURE, NAYA! I WAS MAKING <i>CONVERSATION</i>! I WASN&#39;T INSULTING HER OR DOING ANYTHING TO HER! I TRIED BEING HELPFUL! I TRIED GIVING HER A CHANCE! BUT IT JUST BITES ME IN THE ASS, RIGHT?&quot; <br><br>Terabyte&#39;s mobile platform cautiously approached its partner. It extended a hand towards the Time Lord. <font size="2"><font>&quot;Emiran,&quot;</font></font> said Terabyte.<br><br>The former soldier whirled around and looked at Terabyte. He paused to take a deep, shaky breath and wiped his nose. &quot;Yes?&quot; The geth took an end of the glowing red scarf it got from the gift exchanged and gently dabbed at the Guardsman&#39;s eyes. <font size="2"><font>&quot;The isomorphic controls are still there, yes? You have nothing to fear. As soon as the thief will attempt to operate the screwdriver you&#39;ll receive a notice. Remember?&quot;</font></font><br><br>The Guardsman stood still for a moment, then let his shoulders slump. &quot;Right. I forgot about those.&quot; He sighed. &quot;Yeah. Any second now we&#39;ll get the email. Thanks.&quot;<br><br>Terabyte pulled the Guardsman into a hug. <font size="2"><font>&quot;She will provoke you. You will not take the bait. You will be prepared and you will respond appropriately.&quot;</font></font> The Guardsman returned the hug. &quot;You&#39;re right, of course. Thanks.&quot;<br><br>Naya smiled and patted Terabyte on its shoulder as she walked past the pair. &quot;I&#39;m stepping out. I&#39;ll go and file a formal complaint against the Notary through Central: we&#39;ve got enough interactions with her to warrant action from the higher-ups. Catch you two later!&quot; <br><br>&quot;Bye,&quot; said the Guardsman as the quarian left the RC. He wiped his eyes again (&quot;No, TB, you don&#39;t need to get your scarf dirty-- I&#39;m fine!&quot;) and made his way to his seat in front of the Console. He opened his email and refreshed the page. The Guardsman squinted at the screen.<br><br>One new message. Isometric controls report unauthorized use at coordinates... aha. DoSAT. Terabyte tapped his partner&#39;s shoulder. The Guardsman turned around and saw Terabyte handing him his tricorn hat. <font size="2"><font>&quot;Shall we?&quot;</font></font> asked the geth. The Guardsman took his hat. <br><br>&quot;Let&#39;s roll.&quot;<br><br>- - -<br><br>((Very sneaky. I&#39;d hate to be the Guardsman: his laser screwdriver is is little pride and joy. It&#39;s pretty much achieved the role of practical good-luck charm in his eyes. Well played, Notary. Well played.))</p>

            <p>The Guardsman and Terabyte stepped though it, closing the portal behind them. The nodded to each other and pushed the doors open.

Note: create such countermeasures immediately.

What kind of case do you want? Something like mine?&quot; He held up his laser screwdriver. The polished silver case caught the lab&#39;s light, making it a mirror-like shine. The tip of the screwdriver was composed of a triangular brass hood wrapped around a red diode-- a shape somewhat reminiscent of the nib of a fountain pen. A line of well-worn black buttons stretched down one of the screwdriver&#39;s sides. &quot;Or maybe something else?&quot;</p>

            <p>&quot;A sensible question. That&#39;s two now. Anyway, the point of a hardcopy is to be hard-wearing. You&#39;ll need a high-quality paper, nice high gsm - that&#39;s grams per square inch, if you&#39;re wondering - and I like cream, personally, but there are a lot of colours available. Treat paper like a nightclub bouncer. What you want is heavy, hard, and really bloody thick.&quot;</p>

            <p>&quot;It is your purview to analyse new Time Lord agents for potential Suvian traits. Those are all the forms you&#39;ll need, along with hardcopies of every mission report she&#39;s ever filed, details of her mission to Rose Potter - in, if you&#39;ll pardon the phrase, exacting detail - and a little light reading to get you fully up to speed on the changes to the forms since their inception a few years ago. That, for reference, is the really <i>big</i> pile. I had to work out a lot of the kinks. The majority of the data is passlocked - there&#39;s a test at the end of the paperwork change details, and if you score 100% on it, you pass, and the work on Agent Dives&#39;s assessment can begin. It&#39;s simply standard procedure. I trust you&#39;ll be able to cope.<br><br>&quot;As for how I got into your bed, I regret it immensely but you must understand how lonely life on a mission can be...&quot;</p>

            <p>&quot;You were put in the role you were in during the Time War because you were <i>expendable</i>, Grunt. Nobody gave a damn if they lost you.

            <p>We kinda all realized that we were canon fodder during the first few months of the War. It all went downhill from there, trust me. So what if I&#39;m expendable? It won&#39;t stop me from trying to do something worthwhile. I dream of a better future for Time Lords-- a future where we actually care about the world around us and don&#39;t sit around, all complacent-like. The Time War was a much needed kick in the pants and the Doctor gave us all a second chance. We&#39;re gonna capitalize on that and make things better.<br><br>And you know what?

            <p>Why do you provoke people that are stronger than you? It honestly seems rather stupid to make enemies of a bunch of homicidal maniacs on a hair-trigger, and yet you seem hell-bent on doing so. That&#39;s something I&#39;d expect from an orc.

The Could-Have-Been King. <i>These</i> are the weapons we unleash when Time Lords are killed by monsters lurking in the dark. A fission device is to them as a broken branch is to a staser.&quot;</p>

            <p>-Time War question.<br><br>First time I regenerated into the opposite sex? To be perfectly honest, I was mainly preoccupied with two things: a, that I was finally off Gallifrey, and b, that Gallifrey was gone and there&#39;d been an unbelievably vast <i>war</i>. Somewhere in there was all the confusion about having longer hair and different balance and a larger chest and all, but...it kind of took second place to everything else.<br><br>Of course, the <i>second</i> time I regenerated into a female body--which wasn&#39;t actually that long after--I...well, I was still trying to deal with Gallifrey&#39;s destruction, but there was also this stray thought that this body felt rather nice. A good weight, you know? Long hair, sure, but the interesting sort. And good hands. I like these hands. They can do a lot.<br><br>So. Considering I went from &#39;skinny student&#39; to &#39;slightly stronger and on the run&#39; to &#39;why do I have a different body <i>now</i> this is horrible timing&#39; to &#39;hey, I have a body that feels comfortable and isn&#39;t injured&#39;...<br><br>Well. Let&#39;s just say that, so far, this regeneration has been working out well for me, at least physically.<br><br>Any other questions? I&#39;m here all night. [dramatic arm sweep]<br><br>-R</p>

            <p>Kaitlyn: Uh... Intelligence sent me the reports, so I had to do them? And I&#39;d love it if everyone else did their jobs too?<br><br>OH WAIT you mean the reports and the concrit, don&#39;t you? Well, I just thought: most authors aren&#39;t actually villains, so why not try to help them? If anyone knows about their fics, it&#39;s the people who&#39;ve been inside them! So I decided to help out. Simple as that, really!<br><br>~K~<br><br>((I guess this is really a question for me, maybe? My answer is that... basically I was fed up with every new recruit to the PPC being from TVTropes and not actually being a writer. ^_~ I wanted something PPC to be up on Fanfiction.net, so that fanwriters could find us again. I also wanted it to be something that presented the best face possible for the PPC - hence the concrit, and the use of &#39;Suvian&#39; rather than any gender-specific terms.))<br><br>~<br><br>Huinesoron: Working in the PPC is like standing in the Siege of Angband, with one important exception: portal technology means <i>we</i>, not <i>they</i>, control when we have to meet the foe. No more surprises; I like that.<br><br>So it is a fulfilling duty. It&#39;s still dangerous, of course - my work consists of hunting down the creators of abberent geography and putting an end to them, of course it&#39;s dangerous! - but each mission is a strike against the Suvians who plague our world. I think that&#39;s worthwhile.<br><br>hS</p>

I think it&#39;d be brilliant if other people did the whole concrit thing. Ella was so disappointed that her department was never a big thing; it&#39;d be a lovely tribute if we could make it work in our own, um, work. Also, who knows? Maybe if badfic writers get a little advice, they can develop all the quicker into goodfic writers! ~K~<br><br>((That&#39;s the Department of Author Correspondence, of course. As for me: I&#39;d love to see all aspects of the Driftwood setup becoming more common, but not piecemeal. If people start posting their missions to FF.net when those missions consist of angry shouting, it&#39;s not going to look very good! Public-facing stories should take their audience into account - and the audience on FF.n is mostly young authors without much experience writing. But with that huge caveat in mind - yes, absolutely! ~hS))</p>

            <p>I mean, a decent handgun is good in most circumstances, but I wouldn&#39;t go up against Daleks or zombies with one, would I? What people fail to understand is that it&#39;s not about any <i>specific</i> gun - it&#39;s about the innate characteristics of <i>guns</i>. All that power stuffed into a handheld weapon - the ability to keep your opponent are a distance, especially when they don&#39;t have the same option - the fact that you can fire multiple bullets in a row - what&#39;s not to like?<br><br>((Look, it was either that or randomly copying a technical description from somewhere.

            <p>Nothing is immune to <i>correctly applied</i> fire. It&#39;s only if you think of the pyrotechnic arts as consisting entirely of &#39;set fire to Suvian&#39; that you have a problem, but fire can do <i>so much more</i>. It can bring buildings down on people; it can weaken stones and even metal enough to create deadly traps.

            <p>No, in all honesty, one of the best things about the Continuity Council is that they aren&#39;t all that fond of <i>doing</i> anything.

            <p>I don&#39;t want him to get any more... irritated. I have to live with him, remember?<br>Anyway:<br>-The Librarian doesn&#39;t &#39;hate everything&#39;. First, there are a few things he actually likes - books, computers, his Tablet, etc. Second, he doesn&#39;t hate the majority of things he doesn&#39;t like; he just thinks they&#39;re not worth of his time, or inferior, or barbaric, or a nuisance, or... you get the idea.<br>-I think it has something to do with cataloguing of knowledge. Not sure, though.<br>-He didn&#39;t tell me his real name and I&#39;m not planning on asking, but I&#39;d figure it&#39;s not &#39;Alfonso&#39; - he&#39;s a Time Lord, not an ape, as he might say.<br>Now excuse me while I go wash my mouth, saying that made me feel ill.</p>

You know him best, of course, so you tell me. If she hadn&#39;t left the Academy, though, I&#39;m not entirely sure she would have been part of the fighting--I don&#39;t know if it was ever mentioned in canon materials, but I&#39;m guessing that sending Academy students out to fight would probably not have happened until things were <i>really</i> horribly bad.

            <p>Actually, I&#39;m not sure we&#39;ve met properly yet. Hey there. I&#39;m the Reader. I&#39;m also the Citrine Theorist and Onyx Monitor of the Continuity Council of Gallifrey-In-Exile, or the...ConCounGalInExile? Whatever the Notary keeps abbreviating it as. You probably know this by now, but my duties as Onyx Monitor involve keeping an eye on new PPC Time Lords--make sure they&#39;re settling in properly, and, like the Notary said, watch out for Suvian tendencies...all of that. So we should definitely meet. I can probably answer some of the questions you have (I&#39;m guessing they haven&#39;t all been answered yet), and I like to think I&#39;m much easier to get along with than the Librarian and the Notary.<br><br>So, now the introduction&#39;s over...you&#39;re definitely welcome to come. Please do. Have you ever seen a TARDIS with a purple interior before? The first time I woke up in there--and I woke up on the floor--it became my favorite colour. Though, uh, I may have been a bit biased due to the fact that I&#39;d been trying to get to a TARDIS for--<br><br>Well. Anyway. You should definitely come.

Some of them require a lot more strategy to kill than others. I like to use Thunder Wave to incapacitate them, whenever possible, but other status moves would be nice if I had them.

            <p>For Arinellya: Several centuries of training, eh? Interesting. Alright, a follow-up question, but a bit personal: Why Bad Slash? I assume you would have to have an extensive knowledge of things you might have to deal with, so I&#39;d like to know: did that training include a vow of celibacy, and if not, how has your love life influenced your handling of Bad Slash material? :P<br><br>(Asking the hard questions here!)<br><br>For Kalen: If you could be transferred to a different division, what would you choose?</p>

            <p>Direct your compliments to my parents: I didn&#39;t do anything. Baby, I was born this way. <br><br>With respect to the Continuity Council... ugh. Let&#39;s go though the list, shall we?<br><br>The Fisherman - Never met the man but I hear he&#39;s very mellow. He&#39;s the Ruby Shipwright too-- that means he knows his way around a TARDIS. On paper he sounds like the kind of guy you want to hang around. Let&#39;s hope it&#39;s like that in real life.<br><br>Morgan - I once disagreed with her club&#39;s mission and she&#39;s taken it quite personally. We met a few times in the hallways-- exchanged greetings and cold stares. She&#39;s not openly hostile, though. <br><br>The Reader - Aside from meeting her at Rudi&#39;s once and my little chat with her a few hours ago I haven&#39;t had much contact with her. She seems like a nice person, though. She&#39;s even agreed to let me work on her TARDIS! I tried pinning down her model: it&#39;s either a Scendles Type 77 and or a Cerulean Type 99-- my chapter&#39;s TARDISes--  but I need to physically get a look at how the Console is wired to confirm my suspicions. <br><br>The Librarian - Coward. Deserter. Honorless. I have little respect for a man who wilfully abandons his unit in battle.<br><br>The Disentangler - Never met her.<br><br>The Agent - I saw him eating at Rudi&#39;s once through the pub&#39;s windows. I would&#39;ve introduced myself but there was a Suvian shooting at me at the time. <br><br>The Notary - No comment.<br><br><br>So... possibly four friendly people out of seven. I&#39;d like to meet them all at least once to see what they&#39;re like-- and I never want to lay eyes on the Notary ever again.</p>

            <p>Dream model? Prydonian Type 83. With its oversized engine, elegant computer architecture, tough-as-nails time-recursion shielding, and compact room design it&#39;s the finest exploration ship we&#39;ve ever produced. It&#39;s a bit tricky to pilot-- the TARDIS gets really grumpy if her engines aren&#39;t recalibrated regularly-- but the 83 is a beautiful ship that will care for you as much as you care for her. <br><br>An interesting-yet-highly-unsettling model are the Type 100s. They&#39;re honest-to-god talking TARDISes that adopt a humanoid form and can walk about. The creepy part is that they&#39;re derived from of one of the Doctor&#39;s companions (officially known as the Type 102) which <i>morphed</i> into a TT capsule after she had some TARDIS tech integrated to her body. I don&#39;t want to know what happened next but my professors at the Academy just said that a Type 102 had been crossed with another experimental design to produce the Type 103 and its successors. They&#39;re still TARDISes-- bigger on the inside, piloted by Console, Chameleon Circuit, shields, the works-- but you can directly interface with the Matrix. You can <i>talk</i> to them.<br><br>As much as I&#39;d like to be able to talk to my TARDIS... I have a lot of questions concerning the origins of the 100s. It feels... wrong, in a way. Not natural. I think it&#39;s the Uncanny Valley effect but using a machine that looks like a walking, talking person puts me on edge. I saw a lot of them during the War, talked to a few, rode in a 103 just one time but never got over how creepy they were. Give me a standard model any day. </p>

            <p>It&#39;s not a Prydonian, but the Notary&#39;s TARDIS is a type 83. I... think she said it was that. I&#39;d check, but, um, that&#39;s a big ol&#39; nono. And you can get some requisition forms for that, because she likes to keep hard copies of everything and there&#39;s some lying around here, and, um, I heard what she did because I was passing and I heard shouting. Like, a lot of shouting. And when I got back she was smiling but it wasn&#39;t a nice smile because I think she forgot how to do those. Um. So, if you wanna... grab a Type 83 blockade runner? That&#39;s your in. And it&#39;d <i>really</i> tick her off. Just sayin&#39;, she started it.</p>

            <p>Right. Sorry you had to hear that. I really need to keep a lid on things like this.<br><br><br>So, a Type 83 blockade runner. I bet she mistreats it, too. She&#39;s a clerk: what does she know of TARDIS repair? The poor thing: I could single-handedly restore it, make her healthy again... but no. No, I have to decline. I can&#39;t stoop to her level by engaging in tit-for-tat: she&#39;s going to literally strangle me in red tape if I touch her things. I don&#39;t want to escalate the situation, right?<br><br>That being said... a while ago at Rudi&#39;s you mentioned that she had a nickname. &quot;Honeybee&quot;, right? You said that it would make sure she never came near me again. At this stage in the game I don&#39;t want to do anything that might worsen the situation. How sure are you that this would work? This will either destroy the Notary or make her destroy <i>me</i> if I play this card. And how okay is it to use something extremely personal from her past against her? She&#39;s kinda pathetic to be honest-- from my point of view it&#39;s like kicking a sick puppy lying on the ground. <br><br><br>- - -<br><br>((IIRC, the Notary flew a Dromeian 89 as described in <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=241484;article=3167;title=PPC%20Message%20Board">this</a> CCoGiE episode.

Moments ago, I am ashamed to say I fled from what appeared, against all rationality, to be some manner of upright mechanical man! I am informed that your department is the closest thing to a constabulary here, and therefore throw myself upon your mercy, sir! To put it bluntly, sir, I know not where I am and I am most grievous frightened!&quot;<br><br>---<br><br>((This is the introduction of Algie, an upcoming character from the universe of noted inky breezeblock <i>Jonathan Strange and Mister Norrell</i> and general Friend of English Magic. JS&amp;MN is a wonderful book, which I have recently reread after the so-far excellent BBC adaptation came out, and Algie&#39;d fit right in; a Strangeite practitioner of magic spells, but moreover a gentleman of learning and good character, if slightly overmuch given to panic. He&#39;ll be a DIA Special Respondent paired with a refugee from <i>XCOM</i>&#39;s Long War mod, which makes vanilla XCOM&#39;s Impossible difficulty look like a massage from a supermodel made of chocolate and cloud fluff. Field Commander McCandless, the refugee in question, is a short blonde woman with a penchant for plasma weaponry that borders on the fetishistic and a slightly odd past. They&#39;ll be introduced in a proper fic that will be started Soon(tm) - I&#39;m basically waiting on Iximaz to finish reading <i>Worm</i> so that she can understand what&#39;s wrong with the fic and also so I have someone to sob with in a totally undignified manner. =] ))</p>

            <p>&quot;Hey, Naya. I thought that we were having the Q&amp;A with the PPC Boarders and their agents. Why is <i>work</i> popping up on my screen?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Just answer it, will you?&quot; said the quarian as she fiddled with the RC&#39;s clean room controls. &quot;So, what&#39;s up?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Some poor soul doesn&#39;t know where he is. I&#39;ll get it.&quot;<br><br>&quot;All right. I&#39;ll be taking a shower in the clean room. Message my Omni-tool if you need me.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Gotcha. I should be back soon.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Mmh.&quot;<br><br>The Guardsman cracked his knuckles and wrote his reply:<br><br><br>&quot;Greetings, Earl Algernon. Don&#39;t panic: you&#39;re probably in one of the most secure places in the multiverse right now. You&#39;ve most likely stumbled across a hole in the fabric of the universe and fell into our Headquarters-- again, don&#39;t worry, you&#39;ve contacted the right people. It&#39;ll be much easier for me to explain the situation to you in person than over this messaging service so how about I swing by and give you the tour? I&#39;ve got your location logged on my machine and I can use a portal to get to you quickly.&quot; <br><br>The Time Lord glanced to a side screen and typed in a command. Okay. So this Earl was messaging him from a vacant RC. No problem. He turned back to his email.<br><br>&quot;I&#39;ll be at the door to the room you&#39;re in by the time you finish reading this message. I won&#39;t keep you waiting, I promise! I look forward to meeting you in person.&quot;<br><br>The Guardsman signed his email and sent it. He rose from his seat, sidestepping various bits and pieces of electronic components scattered all over the floor as he made his way to his RC&#39;s front door. Once there he took his Inverness coat and tricorn from the coat rack and put them on. He dug in his pockets, fished out his RA, and plugged in the coordinates to the RC where the Earl was waiting. &quot;Terabyte, hold the fort while I&#39;m out, please!&quot; he called as he stepped through his portal. <br><br>- - -<br><br>((Sorry for the delay. I had a rather busy morning. <br><br>Ooh, new agents. They certainly sound very interesting! I can&#39;t wait to see what you&#39;ll cook up for them.))<br></p>

            <p>A door in the air appeared. Algie staggered back aghast as a man in peculiar dress stepped from the portal, tripping over the Generic Surface table in his flight. &quot;Are - are you he? This Emir of whom wagging tongues have spoken? Are you a fairy? Is this Lost-Hope? I dem - I <i>humbly request</i> that you take me to King Stephen. His Court is no enemy to any English gentleman, as you are no doubt aware... and, and yet I feel not a drop of magic in the air... and what spells I have tried to cast have, have failed, without exception... this is not Lost-Hope then... is this Hell?

            <p>&quot;I see now that this is a death of some kind, and a weapon will do me no good if my magic has left me. No, not dead... lost. In Limbo, as an unbaptized babe or pagan hero of old might be. I... I cannot go home, can I? To Perenelle Abbey, to the village, to the Hanover Square Academy... even if I am not dead, it is as close as makes no difference. I am scared, Sir Guardsman, I am scared to the very marrow and I feel no shame in admitting it. But I can... I can be of use, can I not? I was a scholar. A gentleman of means, which, which I suppose will be passed to my son.

I wish only that I would <i>see</i> it, Sir.&quot;<br><br>Algie sagged slightly, fishing the pistol out and proffering it to the Guardsman. &quot;I&#39;m afraid I cannot offer a sword, Sir, and you have my apologies. This must suffice until I can have one made that will see me here. I do hereby pledge allegiance to your Protectors of the Plot Continuum, and hope that you will allow me to serve in the ranks of your constabulary. Becoming a scholar of magic takes considerable acumen and a gift for detective work, if I may be so bold, even in such a place as Yorkshire. As long as you bring no suffering, and only relieve it, you will have what aid I can give you.&quot;</p>

I can imagine that&#39;s going to raise a few eyebrows.&quot; The Guardsman stepped to the side. &quot;Shall we walk?

            <p>&quot;My good lady wife,&quot; Algernon continued as he walked with the Guardsman, &quot;is the gentlest, kindest soul in all of England, and equally, alas, one of the most incurious. Agamemnon, now, he would be more inquisitive, but... ah! I have it.<br><br>&quot;I shall them them this: that I have been requested, as is often the case for gentleman magicians, to aid His Majesty&#39;s Government in a most secret business; and this is all that I might say, for fear of breaking my sworn oath to the Crown. And is this not true? I am given to understand our organization is charged with the protection of all things, though the meaning of your words is occasionally occluded; logically, this includes His Britannic Majesty George IV and all he surveys. Thus, it is not only my privilege, but my <i>duty</i> to enrol as a member of your society, and see how a friend of English magic may become a dear friend to you all.&quot;<br><br>Algie was summarily presented with a bevy of forms, which he signed with great flourish after being explained how to use the datapads (&quot;Ah! A stylus, of course! In no dissimilar way to the manner in which Homer and his contemporaries inscribed their words upon sheets of pressed beeswax before the advent of the scroll!&quot;). He then pressed the Guardsman closely for more advice. &quot;Sir Guardsman, I beg one last indulgence, if I may.<br><br>&quot;You have spoken to me many times of being a &quot;blip&quot; from a &quot;fic&quot;, and now that I am more aware of what this implies... are we real? My wife and child, my estate, my books - are they too real? Or were we merely shadows upon the wall of a cave, dancing to the tune of some unseen master. So many here... they seem to have been pulled from stories and games meant for children! The pleasant Technician with the Oriental caste to her features mentioned the &quot;benders&quot; of her race, powerful sorcerors all and worthy of the utmost respect - but it transpires that they were conceived by a parade of Johnathons for a kind of automated zoetrope. Am I, too, a child&#39;s passing fancy? What <i>am</i> I?&quot;</p>

            <p>&quot;This is where it gets really, <i>really</i> weird. On one hand our home continua exist as fiction in World One. On the other... well, we&#39;ve led perfectly ordinary lives, haven&#39;t we? We&#39;ve both got families,  friends, education, memories of completely mundane happenings, the works. Nobody from World One has spent their entire lives chronicling everything that happened to us, right? Our stories have main characters: my universe has the Doctor, for example. Everyone knows about the Doctor. Everything is <i>centred</i> around the Doctor. Heck, the show is called <i>Doctor Who</i>. But nobody knows about the rest of us. We got our own lives too! My guess is that by some sheer coincidence bits and pieces of our home universes filter though and pop up in World One. It <i>looks</i> like we&#39;re creations of some author in an office somewhere but what they produce is the tip of the iceberg. We&#39;re still very real people, just... not visible. Yes. That didn&#39;t come out too confused, did it?&quot;<br><br>He then presented Algie with the flintlock. &quot;Welcome to Duty, Officer. You might want your pistol back. Personally, I suggest that you pick up something that hits heavier than this thing. I&#39;m thinking energy weapon-- how about you? And you mentioned being a magic user too? Can you tell me about it? My universe doesn&#39;t have that aspect to it. Science-based and all that. Always interesting learning new things, eh? That&#39;s the big perk of this job: seeing new people and travelling. Given the fact that you&#39;re taking this change of scenery really well I&#39;d say you&#39;re going to fit right in.&quot;<br></p>

            <p>&quot;Oh well, I trust I will be able to find the answer you gave with proper study. As for my magic... hm. A demonstration. A simple cantrip, of Norrellite manufacture, alas, alas, but it will do. Hm.&quot; Algie rifled through the contents of his pocket. &quot;I have need of a mirror and - sir! Sir, I am sorry to impose, but your luncheon there, does it contain meat of any kind?&quot;<br><br>The secretary looked at his cheeseburger. &quot;Y&#39;know, pal, I really ...in&#39; hope so.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Capital! I will only require it for the briefest of moments. If I may? I promise that it will be unsullied, on my honour as a gentleman and magician!&quot; Algie yanked the burger out of the secretary&#39;s unresisting hands and placed it around a compact mirror. He breathed on the mirror, drew a circle, and quartered it, and there it was. The mirror showed an elderly man.<br><br>&quot;Linfield! That old cur! Ha, I knew him for a mischief-maker the moment I saw him! That, Sir Guardsman, is Praisegod Linfield, Bishop of Salisbury, possessor of the aptest name in the country, and arch-Norrellite of the most grievous colour! His pamphlets are well-researched, but only because he has the blessing and funding of the Church at his disposal! What I could have done with that money... I tell you what I would not, Sir, and that is to fritter it away on scurrilous and derogatory pamphleteering! Old Puritan. I&#39;ll have his hide!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yeah, boo, hiss, et cetera, can I have my lunch back please? Thanks, bud.&quot; The secretary picked up his burger and began to eat, noisily and with gusto. Algie did his best not to make a face.<br><br>&quot;That, Sir Guardsman, is English magic. It can do more. Had I a bowl of silver and river-water to fill it with, I could repair any item at a word. I could summon a gentleman from Lost-Hope - and I believe I know the doing of that - but... I fear it pales in comparison to technology. I mean to say, Sir, your portals... they only appeared in the prophecy of the Raven King.&quot;<br><br>And this time, Algie did not speak, but intoned.<br><br><i>The rain made a door for me and I went through it;<br>The rain shall make a door for me and I shall pass through it.</i><br><br>And the air trembled, like a guttering candle.</p>

            <p>&quot;Is he another puritanical Johnathon?

It might amuse them.&quot;<br><br>Algie subconsciously adjusted his powdered wig. &quot;But you ask about the Raven King&#39;s prophecy. It is this. It is something all magicians have known, ever since the Glorious Revival.&quot;<br><br>And once more, his voice changed.<br><br><i>I reached out my hand; England&#39;s rivers turned and flowed the other way;<br>I reached out my hand; my enemies&#39;s blood stopt in their veins;<br>I reached out my hand; thought and memory flew out of my enemies&#39; heads like a flock of starlings;<br>My enemies crumpled like empty sacks.<br>I came to them out of mists and rain;<br>I came to them in dreams at midnight;<br>I came to them in a flock of ravens that filled the northern sky at dawn;<br>When they thought themselves safe I came to them in a cry that broke the silence of a winter wood.<br>The rain made a door for me and I went through it;<br>The stones made a throne for me and I sat upon it;<br>Three kingdoms were given to me to be mine forever;<br>England was given to me to be mine forever.<br>The nameless slave wore a silver crown;<br>The nameless slave was a king in a strange country.<br>The weapons that my enemies raised against me are venerated in Hell as holy relics;<br>Plans that my enemies raised against me are preserved as holy texts;<br>Blood that I shed upon ancient battlefields is scraped from the stained earth by Hell&#39;s sacristans and placed in a vessel of silver and ivory.<br>I gave magic to England, a valuable inheritance<br>But Englishmen have despised my gift<br>Magic shall be written upon the sky by the rain but they shall not be able to read it;<br>Magic shall be written on the faces of the stony hills but their minds shall not be able to contain it;<br>In winter the barren trees shall be a black writing but they shall not understand it.<br>Two magicians shall appear in England.<br>The first shall fear me; the second shall long to behold me;<br>The first shall be governed by thieves and murderers; the second shall conspire at his<br>own destruction;<br>The first shall bury his heart in a dark wood beneath the snow, yet still feel its ache;<br>The second shall see his dearest possession in his enemy’s hand.<br>The first shall pass his life alone; he shall be his own gaoler;<br>The second shall tread lonely roads, the storm above his head, seeking a dark tower<br>upon a high hillside.<br>I sit upon a black throne in the shadows but they shall not see me.<br>The rain shall make a door for me and I shall pass through it;<br>The stones shall make a throne for me and I shall sit upon it.<br>The nameless slave shall wear a silver crown,<br>The nameless slave shall be a king in a strange country.</i><br><br>This time, the Earl all but collapsed, swaying upon his feet as he was. &quot;He came to England, Sir Guardsman, as is the right of the King in the North. He will come here. He is coming. And Sir, as do all right-thinking men, I bid you do as I; and bid welcome to the Raven King.&quot;</p>

            <p>The Guardsman wiped his hands on his coat to get rid of the cold sweat that had formed on his palms. &quot;Erm. Yes. Does the Raven King have a timeframe for his visit or something? &#39;Cause maybe this isn&#39;t the best time for a powerful magician king to visit HQ. This place is a bit of a mess-- loonies with weapons and all that. But if he does pop by for a visit I&#39;ll be sure to pay my respects.&quot; He then rolled his eyes. &quot;Oh, what am I saying. He&#39;s a canon character-- he&#39;s bound to pay a visit here sometime after  some badfic or the other. Not sure how much badfic is written about your home &#39;verse but I hope it&#39;s not too much. Er, for the sake of the good health of the Raven King. Yes.&quot;<br><br>He paused, trying to think of something else to say. &quot;Oh, and you&#39;re absolutely right about Disney. If &#39;Johnathon&#39; means something along the lines of &#39;marketing&#39; then yes, Mr. Walt Disney has been taking old stories and repackaging them into family-friendly tales. You gotta admire the animation work, though. Very talented people.&quot;<br><br></p>

            <p>&quot;The King... will come. This is known, and known to be certain. The prophesy, his prophesy, has already been in large part fulfilled; Strange and Norrell are themselves the two magicians mentioned. As for &quot;badfic&quot;, well, of this I am less sure. I know not, but I believe that the life stories of those two gentlemen are to be adapted for... I&#39;m afraid I cannot quite remember the name of it... ah! Television. From teleos, meaning &quot;far&quot;. So perhaps there will be a revitalization of that community, and with it the attendant horrendous doggerel of which your documentation most eloquently speaks.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Also,&quot; Algie continued, slightly breathlessly, &quot;a Johnathon is an American. I believe the term comes from old cartoons from the days of their Revolution. I admit to it being pejorative, but gently so; like an old playground nickname for a dear friend, though how dear they view the mother country is unclear, considering they sided with the Corsican during the War... hm. I shall definitely be browsing the work of Mister Disney and his fellows, since I have yet to be assigned any work of my own, but your use of the words &quot;family-friendly&quot; gives me considerable pause. I fear he will turn the old stories into pablum, fit more for a mimsyish parson than a family. What stories has the gentleman remade in his own own image?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Look it up,&quot; said the secretary from around his burger, &quot;you have a datapad.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Indeed. I... yes. And if we select thus...&quot; the Earl&#39;s eyes lit up. &quot;This is a library.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Nah, &#39;s&#39;definitely a datapad-&quot;<br><br>&quot;Sir, you mistake me, this is a <i>library</i>! In the palm of one&#39;s hand! Is it perhaps possible to convert a book directly into the form used by this magnificent device?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Uh, not exactly? I mean, you can scan the pages, but-&quot;<br><br>&quot;Excellent! Sir Guardsman, if you will permit, I must return to Perenelle immediately and retrieve my books. My man will take them to my Response Centre, and from there... all shall have access to my spells! Oh, I feel like a child at Christmas morning!&quot;</p>

            <p>...down the corridor in the opposite direction of Algie when he heard the muffled curse behind him. He turned and quickly made his way back to the newly-minted DIA officer&#39;s side. &quot;Hey, me again. Okay: actual, real last piece of advice. While it may <i>look</i> that way, HQ isn&#39;t very well organized. This place is spread across six dimensions and makes absolutely no sense unless you&#39;re a freaky psychic Flower. <br><br>&quot;Long story short. You got your four standard dimensions: 3D and time plus probability and consciousness. Don&#39;t worry about probability, it only applies in certain cases. What you wanna care about is consciousness: if you focus on your destination or your surroundings you travel along the consciousness dimension and induce this weird effect where the local area will loop on itself. What you want to do instead is lose focus. This will allow you to move in the <i>other</i> direction in the sixth dimension and eventually reach your destination. It&#39;s not very scientific, I know, but that&#39;s how the cookie crumbles I&#39;m afraid. When you&#39;ll go through Basic Training your instructor should show you a simplified map and explain the effect better than me.&quot; The Guardsman paused for breath. &quot;There. I think you&#39;re pretty much set for what&#39;s coming. Any other questions? I&#39;ll do my best to help.&quot;<br><br></p>

            <p>&quot;I have been reading through this list and I fear I must ask you to indulge me once more. Is... anyone allowed to join?&quot;<br><br>Algie sighed and turned again, pocketing the datapad. &quot;I am afraid. My wife... she was always enamoured of Mister Strange, and rightly so in my opinion, for he was and remains the truest gentleman, Sir, the very truest. And I fear, Sir Guardsman, that she is... I hesitate to say the word. Her hair, for one, glows as gold when the light of a sunset catches it - and I have often remarked upon it, because she enjoys being told that she is beautiful, and I have no reason to lie and say that it is not so - save for a streak of crimson that frames the left of her face. Her skin is pale and she favours powders that make her paler. And, Sir Guardsman, she is more adept at magic than any I have seen, and I have seen many mighty magicians of the day! We entertained many, Sir, Perenelle is renowned for its hospitality and I am as proud of its reputation as a gentleman may be, and she has stunned them all to silence with her magic! I...&quot; He wrung his hands. &quot;You see why I am afraid.&quot;<br><br>And now that the Earl had mentioned it, the Guardsman probably did. Algie was a roundish sort of man whom, in his green frock-coat and powdered wig, resembled nothing so much as an inflated pea. His face was broad, his nose short and pointed, and his eyes a piercing blue and slightly too small for his features. The rest of him was nondescript, totally, totally nondescript. A common enough description for such as him, and most fitting.<br><br>&quot;I love her,&quot; he said, &quot;and Agamemnon loves her. Indeed, it is simply impossible not to! One would have to have a heart of stone! And I read of this organization and the devilry it faces and...&quot; He trailed off, his shoulders drooping slightly. &quot;I must apologise. This was a private matter and a private grief; I should not have inflicted my sorrows upon you. But I, I cannot... excuse me.&quot; He sighed again, pinching the bridge of his nose between two of his hands. &quot;You see? This is a curious habit! I do this, this gesture almost akin to prayer when I am dealing with extremes of temperament, and it is a habit that I have had since I was but a boy, and yet when I have been at Perenelle I cannot recall a single instance in which I have done it! This, this pistol,&quot; he scrabbled at his belt and pulled it out, &quot;it is half of a matching pair with my good lady wife&#39;s, and she is a keener shot than a Greenjacket! I do not want this to be so, Sir Guardsman! I do not want to deprive Agamemnon of his mother, when my own was t-taken from me when I was but half his age, and which tragedy I am only recalling now! I do not <i>want</i> this!&quot;</p>

            <p>The Guardsman listened intently to Algie&#39;s speech. &quot;No, it&#39;s fine,&quot; he said to the Earl. &quot;In fact, it&#39;s a good thing you talked to me. Supernatural beauty, preternatural command of magic and superior marksmanship-- with a flintlock no less-- along with being enamoured with one of the protagonists.

DMSE&amp;R!&quot; he exclaimed as he brought his hands together. &quot;They&#39;ve recently decided to expand their program concerning live subjects. Your wife-- if she&#39;s Suvian-- we can try and bring her to them. I honestly don&#39;t see why everyone needs to die all the time. As for your son, we have a Nursery here that can take care of him. He&#39;ll be in good hands. We just need to alert DoI and DMS and tell them about your case. I&#39;m sure someone will understand.&quot;<br><br>- - - <br><br>((Seriously.

            <p>&quot;I... it pains me deeply to speak of my wife this way. As a Suvian, as a subject for testing, like some poor departed soul&#39;s body under the knife of an Edinburgh anatomist. And yet I must, because that is what she is. My son is but thirteen years and I, I must explain to him that his mother is some manner of changeling monster. But it is not just my blood family of whom I must think.<br><br>&quot;I am a gentleman, a titled man, and - I like to think - a man of principle. I am possessed of an estate of eight thousand pounds a year. I have servants; but a mere few, yes, but their families have been at Perenelle for generations. At least, that is what I believe to be so, but I am, I am unsure now of what is and is not real. If the Suvian is removed, then, then canon will snap back, and I cannot ascertain their fate. I must ensure their safety, Sir! For they are as much a part of my family as any other!<br><br>&quot;My father once said to me, and I only now find myself able to remember him say it, that it is how a gentleman treats his inferiors that will shew his innermost character. You yourself speak in terms of Duty, of the burden you must bear to ensure the safety of countless lives who will never know of your existence nor mourn when it ceases. This, Sir Guardsman, is my Duty. It is a duty of care to those who have served me and mine. So I must ask: can they join?&quot;<br><br>---<br><br>((Something else people forget: the servants. We know the Sue who rules as Queen has to be killed; what of her palace guards, her chambermaid, her farriers and coachmen and scullery-maids? It is no great stretch of imagination for an estate&#39;s master to be kind, and wise in the application of his kindness. They will be fed and watered; they will, arguably, have a better life here than in canon. Loyalty begets loyalty, and deserves it too.))</p>

            <p>&quot;Once again, Sir, I am entirely in your debt; and once again, Sir, I am forced to say that it could not be to a more deserving man. But come, Sir Guardsman, we must make haste!&quot; Algie powered off down the corridor, striding purposefully despite his stature being rather small and spherical. He was scribbling away upon his datapad, leafing through departments and quietly piecing together the places to which his servants would be most suited. Shortly, they were back in the Induction Centre, accompanied by an Intelligence officer and an enormous walking rose bush dressed in a suit of clothes, which frankly was by no means the weirdest thing to happen to-day, so Algie just went with it. The rose bush was introduced to him as the Sub Rosa by one of the other staffers, clearly from Intelligence themselves.<br><br>&quot;I, I...&quot; the Earl straightened, and adjusted his wig. &quot;I am delighted to make your acquaintance. Madam,&quot; he added hurriedly after a surreptitious check of his datapad. &quot;Might I also take the opportunity to commend your wit? Yours is a fine pun, and no mistake. But let us get to business. I have taken the liberty of constructing a plan of action for the integration of my personal staff...&quot;<br><br>The plotting went on for some time, with the occasional delay for the Earl&#39;s delight at PPC technology to subside. It was still a good plan, though; everyone at Perenelle Abbey had skills that they could bring to bear, and while there had been an argument concerning the gardeners, an amicable solution was reach when it was brought up that fantasy continuua divisions were always on the lookout for people who knew how to handle dangerous lumps of worked, sharpened metal. Over time, though, Algie&#39;s unease returned.<br><br>&quot;I pray that my wife remains unharmed, milady. I... She is a Mary Sue, this is beyond question, but she is my wife and I cannot help but love her, unconditionally and without question. It is not my place to say, but if you could find it within yourself to ensure her safe arrival into the bosom of DMSE&amp;R&#39;s Live Subjects Program directly, I would be most grateful.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I understand. Thank you, milady. Thank you all.&quot; Algie gestured to the assembled staff, some of whom had only wandered in because PPC people love a bit of street theatre. &quot;This is a most painful episode in my life, and it gladdens my heart that you seek to help me through it.&quot;</p>

            <p>&quot;I have the details lurking somewhere in this contraption... aha! One &quot;Field Commander McCandless&quot; of Response Centre 2,631,513. This is why I have yet to report to the Armoury, Sir Guardsman; her personnel file indicates that she is a weapons specialist, with particular expertise in the combat use of plasma. One of the technicians was kind enough to explain its use to me; guns that shoot starlight. It is like something out of a story, is it not?&quot;<br><br>Algie turned, and his eyes were bright and clear, and not watery at all, by dint of some effort. &quot;To-day has been a strange one, Sir Guardsman. I have learned that nothing is as I had thought; that my world is a winter&#39;s tale; that my wife is some manner of star-being; that my estate and all worldly goods may vanish into the aether without the presence of said woman, at the cost too of near two dozen blameless lives; and yet...&quot; He straightened, and steepled his fingers over his nose, as was his wont. &quot;And yet I have wandered through a soft place in the world, to a more dangerous one than I thought possible to exist, and have found myself among nought but friends. I have lost everything, Sir Guardsman, or shortly will. And yet, I cannot help but feel that it is... that it is for the best.&quot;<br><br>---<br><br>Field Commander McCandless is important, and also quite cute, and will be showing up later. =]</p>

            <p>&quot;...that was unstable by nature,&quot; said the Guardsman. &quot;Furthermore, your home &#39;verse stays clean, your son and your employees are safe, nobody has to die, and you&#39;ve got a new job. I&#39;d say that&#39;s a huge plus. Tell you what: once you&#39;re settled in I&#39;ll take you to Rudi&#39;s pub and buy you a beer or someth-- wait. Did you say &#39;Field Commander McCandless&#39;?&quot; The Gallifreyan man smiled. &quot;Oh, I think I know who that is. I was at the range the other day and I was in the lane next to her.

            <p>&quot;I do hope you will call for tea once my new garret is in a suitable shape for visitors, Sir Guardsman; moreover, if you have any future cause in which English magic will be an aid to success, do not hesitate to request any service I can offer. As for the Commander, for all that she has a most peculiar name, if she possesses your recommendation then I shall consider her a bosom companion already. Thank you once more, Sir Guardsman, for all that you have done. Bless you, Sir. God bless you.&quot; With that, Officer Wymbourne of the PPC&#39;s Department of Internal Affairs strolled away, awaiting new life.<br><br>He looked through the personnel file for McCandless again, and wondered just how common a name it was.

            <p>...the centaur is a fine lad. *sigh* No, my refusal to be aknowledged as Gallifreyan has nothing to do with a war I just saw the first shots of. No, it was because of what happened after one of those shots reached my TARDIS, damaging it and sending me to a random part of the multiverse, and the multiversal travel that followed, that ultimately brought me here. I saw things that shaked my beliefs to the core and beings whose power dwarfs the power of the Time Lords. It was... a humbling experience, that shamed me of belonging to such arrogant race. <br><br>But now... I... Wait. Let me sit and think... *sits down and closes her eyes in meditation for a while, then opens her eyes again* Now, your words shame me, Emiranlanoamar. I... was unaware of the existence of opposition agansit Rassilon, and... Dear <i>Aedra</i>... I knew he was mad, but... Deploy the Omega Arsenal? Execute the Ultimate Sanction? I am speechless...<br><br>*sighs after a long pause* Also, there are other reasons I hid myself: My genetic makeup was contaminated at least three times during my travels, I am not fully Time Lord now; I did not wish to be entangled with the petty squabbles of the Continuity Council, and then there are my legal reasons,  I have done multiple transgressions to the Laws of Time, and I fear that what would happen if it is known. I think that will sumarize my reasons to forget my own original name and become a renegade. But if youn believe it is for the best, I will go to Personnel to get my personal information modified and then present myself to the Citrine Theorist and Onyx Monitor Reader of he Continuity Council of Gallifrey-in-Exile, for proper registration. <br><br>Before you speak, do not think for a moment that I attempted to flee Gallifrey. I was trying to get to there before the Daleks to warn the Guardsmen, after all I was just a civilian with nothing but a Sonic Screwdriver with me, but my TARDIS was shot and malfunctioned before I reached Gallifrey.</p>

            <p>Good grief, you were really unlucky. Doubly so because Third and Sixth Fleet intercepted the Dalek Armada literally the <i>minute</i> it entered Gallifreyan space. You <i>barely</i> missed being rescued. It&#39;s too bad you weren&#39;t there to lend us a hand for the rest of the War, though. We needed every Time Lord we could get to repel the Daleks.<br><br>Multidimensional travel, eh? The Daleks must&#39;ve hit your TARDIS right in the primary navigational computer without damaging the chrono-capacitor. There&#39;s no other way you can punch a TT capsule clean out of the universe without destroying it. Fascinating. If you&#39;ll let me, I&#39;d like to have a look at the damage myself. I could write a paper on that and get famous at the Academy when I return! We could team up and search for your Sonic too. It can&#39;t possibly be that far. <br><br>And what manner of creatures are able to scare the Gallifreyan from you? How does that even work? Yeah, Daleks scare the crap out of me but I&#39;m not gonna stop calling myself Time Lord because of that. It&#39;s our species name, y&#39;know. Speaking of which... you&#39;re <i>what</i> now? &quot;Not fully Time Lord&quot;? What exactly happened to you? Regeneration usually kicks in if there&#39;s severe genetic contamination. And would you care to explain to me how you violated the Laws of Time? Come on: we&#39;re both adults and keeping secrets for the sake of being mysterious just leads to more problems in the long run.<br><br>Last point: the CCoGiE doesn&#39;t include all of us Time Lords in HQ. Case in point: me. Morgan&#39;s weird little club is more trouble than it&#39;s worth.  By all means, go and update your status-- your genetic makeup might prove to be something interesting-- but I&#39;d advise against actually joining the ranks of the Council. Just... no.<br><br></p>

            <p>I do not desire to join the Council and their eternal squabbles, The Reader is the one resposible of  surveilling the actions of Time Lords within this organization, so I must register with her. <br><br>And yes, you may look at the damage of my TARDIS, I was never very good in that subject at the Academy.

And there was... *shudders* the time that one those beings that manipulate reality with a flick of their fingers manipulated my bio-data. Not sure how much I have been changed in total, but considering I regenerated twice after the last one, probably is not much. *realization kicks in* I have been overly dramatic, have I not?<br><br>Wait. Mysterious? You insult me Guardsman. I do not seek to be &#39;mysterious&#39;, I am just concerned for my personal safety.

            <p>You&#39;re a Time Lord. Changing sex after regeneration is rather uncommon but not unheard of. Why would you be ashamed of a normal body function? On the other hand... why, oh <i>why</i> did you mess with a T.U.S? When we get back home you&#39;re gonna have to hide that fact real well: the Second Doctor was put on trial and <i>executed</i> for that same reason! <br><br>And you didn&#39;t even answer my question: what is the species that could bend reality like that? The Q from <i>Star Trek</i>? Those guys play hardball.<br><br>...but putting all that aside, let&#39;s talk about fun things. Type 47, eh? My god, that&#39;s ancient. It&#39;s a good thing that you had the Mark IX refit on board: Type 47s had this rather embarrassing design flaw where waste from the TARDIS&#39; fusion plant wouldn&#39;t properly be evacuated from the core. As a result there would be this massive buildup of iron particles around the main turbocharger. Now, this would cause the entire engine to seize up, thus triggering the emergency venting system and causing a spectacular blowout by venting plasma directly into the Heart of the TARDIS. Of course, the chono-buffers would clamp down on the fusion core and freeze it in time and allow the TARDIS to safely eject the entire thing into space. It&#39;s just that without the fusion core your time machine would be crippled but hey, it&#39;s better than blowing up. You&#39;d just suddenly be plunged into darkness with only the rumbling of the engine and the ventilation for company until you find a flashlight or plug the backup grid to the Eye of Harmony. The Mark IX Console refit came with a much-needed fix to the engine design so you&#39;re good there. <br><br>If you want me to take a look at it, get your TARDIS moved to the New Caledonia TARDIS docks and gimme a call. Once I&#39;m done with the Reader&#39;s TARDIS I&#39;ll take a look at yours. <br><br></p>

If you&#39;re asking what we would do to fight Hermaeus Mora then we can always try using a Umta-Psionic trap on the Daedric Prince and jettison him from reality using a Battle TARDIS. It&#39;s worth a shot. If that doesn&#39;t work, use a De-mat gun on it. It&#39;s going to leave a big damn hole in the countryside but hey, you want me to annihilate him from reality?

            <p>...but sadly, that does not mean it will work. Usually these beings exist <i>outside</i> of reality, and reality is nothing but a toy for them. The form we see is just a mirage they use to interact with ephemerals like us.<br><br>Regardless, the point of this conversation was how they interacted with me...<br>Well, firstly, I suspect Odin from Rune-Midgarts had a hand in my &quot;suicide&quot;, because I do not remember performing it.

Fortunately, it allowed me to keep my current companions. And after this... happening, I decided to relinquish my weapons, and do not kill again.<br><br>And if you are planing to ask: I have regenerated a total of five times.</p>

            <p>Officially? I&#39;ve regenerated only two times: the first during the War and the second during the Final Day. The first one happened when I was crushed to death by a bit of falling Dalek that was shot down by our AA guns. The second happened when I fell into a plothole during my unit&#39;s last stand on Gallifrey. I fell through the Time Vortex and <i>burned</i>. I somehow found my way to HQ, met my future partners, and regenerated explosively at their feet. Not bad for an entrance, right?<br><br>Unofficially, in separate timelines during the War, I regenerated over a million times. All of these timelines ultimately ended with my death and a complicated troop maneuver through time to save the 442<sup>nd</sup> from annihilation. Rinse, lather, repeat.<br><br><br>The Academy? Oh, that takes me way back. I studied in TARDIS engineering: everything you needed to know to design, build, and maintain a TT capsule. Lots of lectures, tests, note taking, and a surprising amount of hands-on experience. I remember this one professor who would bring in a circuit to class and assemble it in front of everyone while lecturing. It was a nightmare trying to focus on both her words and what she was doing on the circuit board. Nevertheless, she was probably the best teacher we&#39;d ever had. The time rotor homework incident still haunts me to this day, though. We never found out what happened to Kevonozar&#39;s arm: the professors were quick to cover that up.<br><br></p>

            <p>Two days ago <i>The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</i> game was released, but I wonder how many people know about the books that started it all; &quot;The Witcher&quot; saga by Polish author, Andrzej Sapkowski.<br><br>Aside my humble self, is anyone else into this particular fandom? For those who need explanation: The series&#39; main character - Geralt of Rivia - is a witcher: a professional monster slayer, working for the coin to protect the common folk from vampires, ghouls and strigas. It&#39;s a typical fantasy setting: fictional kingdoms, the Middle Ages, monsters and magic. </p>

            <p>Not all of them are, but I am willing to provide my own translation for anyone that&#39;s interested. <br><br>The entire saga consists of two collections of stories:<br>- <i>The Sword of Destiny</i> (1992; English: 2015)<br>- <i>The Last Wish</i> (1993; English: 2008)<br> <br>(The stories contained in <i>The Last Wish</i> take place first chronologically, and many of the individual stories were published before <i>The Sword of Destiny</i>.)<br><br>After that, we have the Witcher Saga itself:<br><br>- <i>Blood of Elves</i> (1994; English: 2008)<br>- <i>Time of Contempt</i> (1995; English: 2015)<br>- <i>Baptism of Fire</i> (1996; English: 2014)<br>- <i>The Swallow&#39;s Tower</i> (1997)<br>- <i>Lady of the Lake</i> (1999)<br><br>Also, in 2013, Sapkowski released a prequel to <i>Blood of Elves</i> called <i>Season of Storms</i>.</p>

            <p>I was pretty young when it was released, and it was the movie that really got me into Star Wars as a franchise, as embarrassing as that is to admit.  Plus, I kind of had a crush on the kid who played Anakin in the first movie.  </p>

            <p>The base order of IV, V, II, III, VI is not so bad, but the loss of I is my problem.  I understand it is not the best quality film, and I understand that Jar Jar is a very annoying character, but with a saga like this, I think you really need to take the good with the bad.  The problem is the prequels being made at all.  As prequels they are supposed to be viewed before the main films.  But the problem then is certain early spoilers.  But I still think the best way is really IV, V, VI, I, II, III.</p>

            <p>It&#39;ll just be like watching a Tarantino film. A really, really, long one. Episode one really isn&#39;t very good, so cutting it out does make sense. It is the second worst Star Wars film, and I think you all know what the worst is(I don&#39;t even consider the worst film part of the franchise). I would like to point out that the fight with Darth Maul might be worth watching, but only that part, really.</p>

            <p>Dare I say it? The Holiday Special. It is only a Star Wars film in the sense that it is a &quot;film&quot; that takes place in Star Wars. I tried to watch it, and I couldn&#39;t finish it. By the way, I read about 80% of the legendary badfic list, and thought it wasn&#39;t that bad. The Holiday Special is even worse than that entire list put together, and it does it while being about 0.05% as messed up as ONE of those items. I do not recommend watching it.</p>

            <p>But that&#39;s just because of Jar-Jar Binks. That... thing just ruined the whole movie for me, and I&#39;m pretty forgiving. I would say that 2 is the weakest movie, but it&#39;s not as annoying as 1, plus it has more cool action. I usually watch 2 when I want an action movie, not a Star Wars movie. When I want a Star Wars movie, I load up 5. And if you want to make 3 funny, just watch Backstroke of The West. Preferably the dubbed version.</p>

            <p>Jar Jar is annoying, but he does not force me to hate the entire thing.  The really forced romance plot in II is just unbearable for me.  It really makes it hard for me to watch it.</p>

            <p>The fake romance in 2 never really bothered me. It does look fake, but I just laugh whenever I see it. So I enjoy the movie, but likely not as intended.</p>

            <p>Here&#39;s a very interesting video of an in-depth talk about how the plot of Episode Two could have changed and brought in a new depth to characters and plot.
