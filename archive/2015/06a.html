            <p>So, I was just listlessly browsing the wiki, clicked the &quot;Random Page&quot; button because why not? and I came across the General Expertise page. <br><br>*cue angelic choir*<br><br>Beautiful. I realized how <i>incredibly</i> helpful it would be to  be able to ask about some of these things in regards to an OC I&#39;m writing for.<br><br>To those who don&#39;t know, I am currently engaged in the rather &quot;Arda&quot;uos task of creating a believable, non-MS Tenth Walker. I&#39;m fairly satisfied with her so far- Amy Trsitan, thirty five year old software architect, fencer, and incredibly socially awkward and isolated human. I&#39;ve already got the basic gist of the plot, including how she got to Middle-earth (approved by hS- yay!), why she is allowed on the Quest, and why she&#39;s <i>going</i> on the Quest. That&#39;s all good. <br><br>What I need the most help with is fencing. Amy is a veteran fencer- she&#39;s been doing it for two decades. At the moment, I actually have her down as a gold-winning Olympian, but I think I&#39;ll tone that way down (unless a wiser head in such manners thinks it&#39;s a good idea?). Anyway, I know the bare basics of fencing, courtesy of Wikipedia and various passing references in books, but I would really appreciate a more in-depth look at the sport; mostly focusing on training. Amy also practices regular swordplay (her weapon of choice is a Roman <i>gladius</i>) and I would deeply appreciate principles and fundamentals in that area as well.<br><br>The other matter I would like some help with is psychology, if possible. Amy has a certain disorder called &quot;selective mutism.&quot; Again, all I know is Wikipedia-level stuff, but basically she chooses not to speak, though she has the ability- sort of. Selective mutism is an anxiety disorder usually found in younger children, and is paired closely with social anxiety. Amy has a severe form known as &quot;progressive mutism,&quot; which means she won&#39;t speak to anyone, rather than not speaking only in certain situations. <br><br>Here&#39;s my current backstory for her, which is very much up for critique and suggestion (and outright &quot;Yeah, you&#39;re totally wrong and that&#39;s ludicrous.&quot; Should that be needed).<br><br>When she was very young, Amy had trouble learning to speak. She also had growing social anxiety, which made it even harder to learn, and eventually she wasn&#39;t making any progress at all. Her parents, who didn&#39;t want to force her to do anything, assumed she would grow out of it. She didn&#39;t, and over time as she used her voice less and less, she convinced herself that she was actually becoming mute (we&#39;ve all experienced that harsh, painful croak when we haven&#39;t spoken for a while). Before long, she was totally sure in her own mind that she couldn&#39;t speak if she tried. Her parents were rightly concerned, but didn&#39;t have the proper resources, and didn&#39;t know that Amy <i>had</i> a disorder, much less that it could be treated. In addition, Amy seemed happier not being able to speak. It removed the pressure from her to be social and talk to anyone, and she was able to get along just fine with her parents using sign language.<br><br>Thus enters fully-grown Amy. Technically, if she learned, she <i>could</i> speak, but she is (a) far too prideful to ask anyone to teach her and (b) would find the whole process mortally embarrassing. <br><br>I apologize if the whole section feels rather vague; I don&#39;t know anything about what the time scale on this would be. Would it all take place before age seven? Age five? I have no idea. <br><br>I also don&#39;t have any experience with true social anxiety; I mean, I&#39;m a little awkward at times, but that&#39;s about it. So.. add that to the list of things I could use help with. <br><br>Anyway, if it&#39;s not too much of a bother, I would really appreciate it if you guys could help me out. I very much want Amy to be a good OC, and these sorts of things are very important to that. </p>

            <p>First off, I&#39;m not officially diagnosed, and I know my &quot;level&quot; of social anxiety isn&#39;t as bad as some people have, since I&#39;m still capable of working around people and having conversations.  I just want to share my experience in case it&#39;s valuable to you.<br><br>So basically, my anxiety reaches it&#39;s true worst on work days that are so busy that I&#39;m having to interact with people constantly, with no down time between zoo guests, and hence, no chance to cool down from acting like a regular human.  Since my normal baseline is to retreat into my thoughts, the days where I&#39;m forced to keep my attention directed outwards towards people make me start to actually feel like I&#39;m losing my sense of self.  Eventually, I get desperate to escape from the people around me, but can&#39;t do so in the middle of a work shift.  That&#39;s when I start to feel hopeless.  My entire body starts to go numb, I get dizzy and start hyperventilating, and I have difficulty keeping my balance and controlling my hands.  I can&#39;t get my body back to normal again until I&#39;m alone and feel safe.<br><br>One weird caveat is that if people are making me <i>angry</i>, then I don&#39;t reach the point of panic attack.  Not really sure why; maybe just because anger hormones are energizing, and keep me from getting that hopeless feeling?<br><br>Again, I don&#39;t know if this is really useful for you, as I don&#39;t know how typical my form of anxiety is, but that&#39;s how it is for me.<br><br>—doctorlit, realizing he pretty much just admitted to the whole Board that he&#39;s actually terrible at his job</p>

            <p>I don&#39;t know enough to really go into detail myself, but my brother fenced for years, and he even reached A-level, which is near-Olympic quality. I&#39;ll do my best, and then if you have specific questions, let me know and I can pass them on to him. {= )<br><br>I think I can safely say that training consists largely of footwork, footwork, and more footwork. The sort of lunges fencers have to do to reach their target while exposing themselves as little as possible are ridiculous—it takes a lot of leg strength and flexibility. Also, you have to be fast and accurate, and you only get that by doing things over and over and <i>over</i>. Actual bouts happen pretty quickly, but the training is intense.<br><br>Then of course there&#39;s learning the rules. Each weapon style has different acceptable target areas—smallest for foil, largest for épée. The style is most different for sabre, though, since you can strike with the blade and not just the tip. I think most fencers specialize in one weapon, maybe expanding into the others if they feel like it or if there&#39;s a need on their team. (My brother specialized in foil, but also competed sometimes in épée, IIRC. I don&#39;t think he did sabre much, if at all.) And you can only score points for touches if you have right-of-way, which I don&#39;t fully understand. It seems fairly complicated.<br><br>You should know that the sport of fencing is not remotely akin to actual sword-fighting. Fencing swords are light and flexible, with blunt tips, so you don&#39;t actually hurt your opponent (apart from some occasional bruising) when you hit them. Real swords are heavy and sharp, and you&#39;re not supposed to stop as soon as you touch the target. Plus, your opponent will not be waiting until they have right-of-way to hit you—they&#39;ll just go for it. Her fencing training might let her avoid a few blows if she&#39;s quick enough at her age, but would otherwise be pretty much entirely against her in actual combat.<br><br>Presumably that&#39;s why you threw in regular swordplay, too, but again I&#39;d caution you that what she practices for sport will not really prepare her for deadly combat where no one has to follow the rules.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>This helps immensely! And that&#39;s so cool! I think that&#39;s what Amy will be; her Olympian status is sort of a relic of a slightly different version of her character, in which she was an over-achiever due to true muteness. A-level provides a reference to her dedication and skill, while avoiding the slightly speshul Olympian. One question I have is &quot;sword forms&quot;- are those.. a thing? I&#39;ve heard of them being used as practice, but through fiction. In my currently-being-written rough draft, that&#39;s how she practices with a non-fencing sword.<br><br>Wow, that is complicated! <br><br>Yes, that&#39;s why I threw it in- although I hadn&#39;t thought about the quickness aspect of fencing. That will come in handy rather often, I think. Amy <i>is</i> fit for her age, due to daily training and a healthy diet to the point of obsession. <br><br>Ah, yes, I&#39;m very much looking forward to that! :) Amy can be an arrogant individual when it comes to her skill set, and she honestly thinks she&#39;s prepared for any sort of fight. Enter big, snarling, definitely-not-playing-by-the-rules Orcs. Amy is going to get knocked down quite a few notches over her time in Middle-earth, starting with her fighting abilities.  <br><br>Oh, two totally off-topic things; on the General Expertise page, there&#39;s a section of religion, and I think I could be listed there under Christianity. I know a fair bit, and what I don&#39;t know I can try to find. I&#39;m just very afraid to make any sort of edit to the wiki- it seems slightly complicated, and I don&#39;t want to mess anything up. Could I ask someone else to edit me onto there?<br><br>The other- I&#39;m still trying to find a title for my story. It&#39;s working monicker is &quot;All of My Tomorrows,&quot; but I think that sounds too cliche and sappy. What do you think?</p>

            <p>Here&#39;s what my brother says, with a couple minor edits and paragraphs added for convenience:<br><br>&quot;For the most part, what [Neshomeh] said was true. Footwork is easily the most important aspect of fencing to hone. If your footwork is good enough, you can participate with little to no experience in any of the three weapons and perform well.<br><br>&quot;The real reason footwork is crucial is distance. If you are half an inch too close they hit you, half an inch too far and you miss them. Precise control takes a lot of strength at those speeds and learning how to control not only how close you are to them, but how close you allow them to come to you is half the game. Getting just close enough so they think they can attack safely, then being just out of reach, is the best way to set up a winning attack. And, as Mr. Miyagi says, the best way to avoid an attack is to not be there.<br><br>&quot;As long as [you aren&#39;t] going to attempt to have this person do any significant amount of fencing in the story, there are a few nice hints that I can describe that will make the character seem more believable. First off, not only does a fencer&#39;s legs have to be very strong, they become asymmetrical after a while. Your front leg (right for most people) will have much larger quadriceps than your left and the left calf ends up looking like someone&#39;s fist embedded in the back of your leg. This is avoidable with exercise, but it&#39;s something unique to fencers that [you] could bring up and impress any real fencers who might be reading.<br><br>&quot;[Your] question of forms is based on Eastern martial traditions, kata and so forth. However, [you] could impart a certain character to Amy&#39;s fencing fairly easily. Each weapon has a very distinct style, too, and within that the best countries in fencing tend to have their own unique personalities: Russians fence in a very direct and simple way, the Italians flourish and spin their blades more dramatically, and the French are just [darned] irritating. Americans are usually heavily influenced by the older styles as their coaches tend to be immigrants from another country.<br><br>&quot;Saber is incredibly quick; each action happens in the course of a few seconds and entire bouts are resolved in less than 3 minutes. Foil is more drawn-out and complex, usually involving both fencers moving from one end of the strip to the other a couple times before any touch is scored. Then épée is much slower-paced, but no less intense in its own respects. The fencers stand off against each other, generally they hop a little bit the whole time, it&#39;s similar to a tennis player rocking back and forth so they can respond instantly. A friend of mine has the nickname &quot;Proud Baby Mudfoot&quot; for not doing this.<br><br>&quot;During this process, each fencer is looking for a weakness in either their opponent&#39;s form so as to attack at an angle that they can strike without being hit themselves (the whole body is valid target in épée), or in their opponent&#39;s rhythm. If you can attack whilst your opponent is mid-step/hop or immediately before they do, so as to surprise them, they&#39;ll usually just kind of stare blankly at you while you poke them indiscriminately.<br><br>&quot;So there are a lot of options [you] can go with as far as what [you want] the character to be like and how potentially real combat would end for her. Speaking of real combat, if [you intend] to use their fencing to actually fight other humans to the death, or the severely wounded at least, there are things that are important for [you] to know. First off, the reason right of way exists is actually to train a person for real combat. The reason you score when you do is to teach you that you need to defend when attacked and attack so as not to be skewered in the process. If they attack and hit you, and you counter-attacked, they get the point because you were dumb and made no effort to defend yourself. If you attack and are parried, odds are they can attack you before you can recover, and if you try and attack again and they hit you, they get the point because you were stupid.<br><br>&quot;Épée does not have right of way; it&#39;s a common misconception that épée is the most realistic because the entire body is valid target and you use the largest blades. Rapiers are very well balanced and quite bendy actually, which is good because if they were too brittle they&#39;d break all the time. Épée was actually training for first blood duels with the goal being simply to touch your opponent first and draw blood to win. If you attacked at the same time and both drew blood there is no clear winner and you continue the match. The exception of course being if one of you is dead and the other isn&#39;t.<br><br>&quot;Saber was set up as training for cavalry troops fighting each other on horseback. Saber has changed the most in its history and in that respect it is virtually useless, but fighting on foot it isn&#39;t as bad though, it&#39;s the fastest and it&#39;s the only one that features cutting attacks. The target areas are set up to teach fighting for maximum effect. Aiming for the body is the most consistent way of scoring a lethal blow. Limbs move about quickly and unpredictably, people are very wary of their heads and can move them side to side very effectively. Watch a high level boxing match and you&#39;ll see what I mean. Torsos are big and the hardest part of one&#39;s self to get out of harm&#39;s way. There are lots of squishy bits that aren&#39;t protected by hard bones for your blade to graze off of. Those squishy bits are also pretty important for people to survive; puncturing lungs, hearts, or stomachs will generally kill if they aren&#39;t treated by very advanced medicine very quickly.<br><br>&quot;How Amy would deal with brutal fighting depends on her level of dorkiness and/or general ferocity. Judging by what I&#39;ve read, she would just die. Without deliberate practice for the purpose of really fighting, all she could rely on would be her footwork and sense of timing, which are really important and would let her dance circles around any one moron with a baseball bat. If she went up against someone with martial weapons training or a group of people, she&#39;d just get smoked. It takes a special kind of dork to work on learning the martial applications of fencing alongside the sporting aspects. Generally speaking, people who achieve an A ranking aren&#39;t dorks, they are athletes. I&#39;m a very rare exception and I wasn&#39;t as great a fencer as I could have been for it.<br><br>&quot;If either of you have more questions I can answer them.<br><br>&quot;Oh, speaking as a fencer with anxiety, there are things that would be likely for Amy. She would be a defensive fencer. She would lose in saber. Saber is entirely too aggressive for someone with any apprehension at all to succeed in. Of course there&#39;s levels of savantism or whatever, [you] could write it off in a lot of different ways, but speaking from experience she would perform ideally in épée or foil. Being taller or shorter would significantly influence her style as well.&quot;<br><br><i>That</i> should really help. My brother is a cool dude. ^_^<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>This is AWESOME- your brother is a veritable <i>treasure trove</i> of knowledge! My great thanks to him, and to you too, Neshomeh!<br><br>I do have a few more questions, if he doesn&#39;t mind- Amy is rather tall at five feet, nine inches, and uses a roughly two foot long sword; how would her style be affected? Judging by what you said, I would say she specializes in foil, so how would that factor in? And also, what Eastern traditions are most commonly practiced, and how would they influence her? Her sword is Roman, and if such a thing exists I could see her trying to train herself in the &quot;Roman way.&quot; She couldn&#39;t do it particularly well, of course, as she has no one to spar with and no teacher besides the internet. <br><br>Amy wouldn&#39;t have trained for battle, really- she might have deluded herself somewhat into thinking she has, but you&#39;re right; she&#39;ll just get smoked. <br><br>Thank you so much for the comments on anxiety; that&#39;s a really big part of her character, and overcoming it is one of the focuses of her story. And now I know that she&#39;ll be a lot more likely to defend, rather than attack, and when facing a raging Uruk that&#39;s generally not what you want to do. <br><br>Again, thanks so much to both of you!</p>

            <p>He writes:<br><br>&quot;So, taller people use their height to its maximum advantage whenever they can. Their game is dictated by their ability to reach out and touch people before they themselves can be hit. They can launch an attack at very long range and retreat to safety before anyone can do anything about it.<br><br>&quot;On the defense, they intercept their opponents mid-attack in what is called a <i>prise de fer</i> (preese de fare). The basic idea is that before their blade comes anywhere near you, you swat it out of the way, and because they were already initiating an attack you don&#39;t have to move at all and they run themselves onto your blade.<br><br>&quot;Another good trick tall people can get away with, when dealing with shorter opponents, is to initiate an aggressive attack that is purposefully going to fail and leave your blade extended in the lunge. The opponent sees this as an opportunity to catch you too close and they move in to strike. As soon as they do this, you hit them and retreat as fast as you possibly can. If your timing is even a little off, they&#39;ll catch you and score the touch. This is the kind of trick that would very likely get someone killed. If you do it right, you just barely touch them and bail. At best it would be a wounding attack, and in a bout scenario, after a point is scored, the action stops for a moment. Advanced fencers know when they have scored and stop right afterwards. If one were to merely wound their opponent, then just stop fighting, odds are they&#39;re about to be very brutally butchered.<br><br>&quot;In so much as fencing is concerned, no Eastern traditions are taught or practiced. Any work on that that Amy might have done would have been on her own time and would, generally speaking, impart &quot;bad&quot; habits on her fencing and hurt her performance at tournaments. The closest equivalent to Western fencing in the East that I know of are the Tai Chi sword forms. Those are worth looking into, YouTube videos abound, if you are interested in making her overall style more fanciful.<br><br>&quot;Romans had &quot;long swords,&quot; but they aren&#39;t the sort of hand and a half European long-swords that are traditionally associated with fantasy novels. A Roman spatha, spathae plural, was modeled after the swords that the Romans had encountered in Gaul, Germany, and Britain. They are more like a Viking sword than anything else. Single handed, broad blade, and they didn&#39;t taper to the piercing point of a long-sword. As a fencer, it would be an abhorrent weapon. Entirely lacking all the precision and grace of more refined weapons. It was heavy, and poorly balanced. Best suited for hacking and chopping. A good weapon for a shield wall, not so good for combat without a shield. The lack of balance and weight of the weapon would leave you terribly exposed on the recovery unless you were really very strong. Like, Gregor Clegane strong.<br><br>&quot;The Roman style of training would have been conducted with a group of people. Very organized and regimented. Romans fought as a group, not as individuals. Rome&#39;s greatest asset in warfare was its ability to field bigger armies more often than their opponents. Their tactics were efficient and brutal, but they did not focus heavily on complicated swordplay. Get 500 guys together, give them big shields, heavy swords, and train them not to run away long enough to win the battle.<br><br>&quot;I don&#39;t intend to dictate to anyone, but late English cut and thrust swords or a rapier would be the best option. They offer balance, speed, and precision. The cut and thrust is heavier and could more effectively parry an attack from heavier weapons. The rapier is of course the ideal, but the only defense option available would be dodging with timing and distance. Those sorts of swords lend themselves the most to the training and skills she would have developed as a fencer.&quot;<br><br>~Neshomeh(&#39;s brother)</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve actually already written that she <i>has</i> one on earth; it would be quite simple to go back and rewrite so that she takes it instead. I might give her the cut and thrust weapon though, since it has a bit more weight. By the way, I&#39;m assuming &quot;cut and thrust weapons&quot; is a group, not a particular sword- which one of them do you think would be best?<br><br>Another thing to keep in mind; Amy&#39;s not used to extended fights. As I haven&#39;t really firmed up the Fellowship&#39;s route yet, it&#39;ll be interesting to see whether or not she has to enter any battles, and what she&#39;ll do in them. Thanks for the different tricks! I&#39;m going to incorporate those at some point.<br><br>I&#39;ll definitely look into those; thanks! <br><br>So, she wouldn&#39;t really like a Roman weapon or style at all- got it. I originally gave her a <i>gladius</i>, but it&#39;s a little thing (although I don&#39;t have many references, so it might be closer to average), and it wouldn&#39;t do much good against bigger swords.  <br><br>Man, it&#39;s a good thing I asked about fencing! My story would have been <i>way</i> off; thank you both! I think I have just one more question; besides speed, what would you say is the most valuable Amy has learned in fencing that will help in a real fight?<br><br>By the way, I&#39;m sorry I didn&#39;t reply more promptly; I only saw your response last night, and it was rather late. I didn&#39;t trust myself to formulate the proper questions.</p>

            <p>I used to fence saber for about two years, back when I was in eighth and ninth grade, but I never learned half of this stuff. I can confirm footwork is important (for all my two cents are worth, considering who&#39;s already given his speech!); it helped me win my first medal thanks to my much more experienced opponent being old and slow.

            <p>I think the real difference is between a world that is still written and a world that has been abandoned. It doesn’t really matter whether the author is still alive. JKR has stated quite clearly that Harry Potter’s story is finished and she doesn’t intend to write more of it. Well, I’m still dreaming of <i>Hermione Granger and the Interspecies Treaty</i> (Harry doesn’t feature, he is too busy rounding up the last Death Eaters), but that’s just a delusion. We occasionally get some breadcrumbs on <i>Pottermore</i>, like we may still get new breadcrumbs from Tolkiens unpublished notes, but if we paid attention to the novels there shouldn’t be any big surprises. <br><br>(On the other hand, Isaac Asimov suddenly wrote new books connecting <i>Foundation</i> to the Robot-novels when the <i>Foundation</i>-universe apparently had been abandoned for decades. Nah, this won’t happen.)<br><br>Anyway, the potterverse felt much differently when we still waited for the next book, and everything seemed possible, and then a lot of fanfiction became outdated when the new book was published. Of course, <b>everything</b> has never been possible. The problems of an incomplete canon and what may or may not plausibly be possible are a major theme in &quot;The Hogwarts Fanfiction Academy&quot;.<br><br>I’ll stop rambling here.<br><br>HG</p>

            <p>Making an actual survey on Google or something? That way you wouldn&#39;t have to comb through a bunch of Pastebin files to gather data. It would be a LONG survey by necessity, but you could split it up by books, films, video games, etc. to keep it neat. You could use the Fandom categories on the wiki as a place to start for gathering options, though of course not every fandom that&#39;s popular now is represented by a page on the wiki and not everything with a page is popular now.<br><br>I&#39;d also suggest setting a working definition of &quot;fandom&quot; that fits what you want to learn. Are you interested in every single thing that people might happen to like, or the ones they actively participate in somehow (i.e. cosplay, fan forums, writing fic, making art, etc.), or just the ones they might conceivably write a mission in? Framing the question will get you better, more specific answers, and also make it easier for us to figure out how to respond.<br><br>~Neshomeh, who can&#39;t be bothered to write out a list of everything she&#39;s ever liked but might tick off some boxes for a few minutes.</p>

            <p>Before you ask: This is going to be a relatively minor RC, and I don&#39;t want to detract from the major three that I&#39;m currently rotating around.

            <p>Luigi is constantly treated in the fandom as an inferior clone of Mario, which may have stemmed from the fact that he started out as a palette swap of him during their 8-bit days. The semi-clone thing is from Smash, though, and I just fixed that to make it more specific.<br><br>I was erring on the side of caution when I cut out the alternate ending, because I&#39;m still not sure how well people would take the agents actually visiting the canons in their element.

            <p>I liked most of this, but there are two things that rubbed me the wrong way.<br><br><i>[...] the anthropomorphic Honedge was so engrossed in this and many other questions that he didn’t realize that he’d passed by the RC he was looking for until he’d kept walking for several minutes.</i><br>This is not how PPC HQ usually works. If you don’t pay attention, you should soon arrive where you should be, although that’s not always where you intended to go. Realizing that you’ve walked too far and trying to return should actually make it more difficult to get there, until you are distracted again. Since Flashback absentmindedly walked past the door rather than crashing into it, he apparently was not supposed to be there yet, possibly because the narrative laws of comedy required that he arrived only after Whitney got the mission, they would have no time to talk, and would go into the fic mostly unprepared. I was disappointed when this didn’t happen.  <br><br><i>It had taken quite a bit of convincing to get Dedede to head through the portal to where Ike was, but the hammer-wielding bird had finally relented once Whitney told him that the match had been cancelled. He wouldn’t be fighting Luigi today – but there was a free-for-all open on the Gaur Plain stage, with Ike already getting ready to go.</i><br>Why didn’t we <b>see</b> this? It’s true that interacting too much with canons is frowned upon, but doing it off-page doesn’t help your cause, especially when you rant about &quot;Show, Don’t Tell&quot; in your author’s notes.<br><br>Typos:<br><i>She looked at him with frightened apprehension, but he turned to <b>he</b> and added [...]</i><br>The second &quot;he&quot; should be &quot;her&quot;.<br><br><i>The humanized Sword Pokémon slammed into the opposite <b>all</b>, and before he could raise his Monado to defend himself, Not!Luigi had begun pummeling him, kicking and pounding.</i><br>Oh, eatpraylove already noticed the missing &quot;w&quot;, and I don’t agree with her second point. Not!Luigi had already begun pummeling Backslash (past perfect) before Backslash could raise his weapon (past tense) looks perfectly right to me.<br><br>HG</p>

            <p>I totally forgot that about the PPC HQ. Stupid me. And I changed things up so that we actually get to see Whitney relocating Dedede, so yeah.<br><br>And one thing I should clarify... Backslash wasn&#39;t told about the agent protocol before stepping into the mission, which is why he acted out of haste and ended up getting the snot beaten out of him. So he actually WAS unprepared, mentally at least, and as eatpraylove pointed out, he was also a little &#39;enthusiastic&#39; about the job - a combination which can be incredibly risky knowing how PPC missions usually go.</p>

            <p>Thanks for defending Luigi&#39;s honor. <strike>I like him better than Mario anyway.</strike> Whitney and Backslash balance each other out pretty well, but I&#39;m confused about a few aspects of all this.<br><br>For starters, what the heck is Backslash&#39;s species? I know he&#39;s a former Stu and therefore a bit canon-breaking by default, but having him as both a Honedge gijinka and a Shulk replacement strikes me as a little overpowered. And mostly confusing. (I assume you wrote the snippet of fic he came from?) He also strikes me as a little too violent for active duty, even with the Glitter removal and therapy sessions. <br><br>I feel like you brought up the possibility of a Wii Fit Trainer Agent in a thread some time ago; if you did, props for somehow making it work. (Still waiting for Brenda and/or Vampire!Robin to get more screentime...)<br><br>My usual list of things...<br>-&quot;...I thought it was the Villager who was portrayed as a psychopathic mass-murderer by the fandom, and not [– OW!]&quot;<br>This doesn&#39;t feel natural. Try something like &quot;...Usually the Villager gets the psycho mass-murderer treatment in this fandom, not [– OW!]&quot;<br><br>Nice trick with using the dummy to protect a threatened/Stufluenced canon. (Ike was under a little Stufluence, right?)<br><br>-&quot;...rubbing his gloved hand over his nose and noting that it was a decal on skin as smooth as glass.&quot;<br>Also clunky. If the point is to show Backslash&#39;s surprise at the (ingenious!) Mii Fighter disguise, try something like &quot;&#39;What am I now?&#39; he asked. He ran a gloved hand over his face, then pulled it back when he realized that his skin had the texture of plate glass. Furthermore, his features felt like decals of some kind.&quot;<br><br>-&quot;...He may need a monster to clobber that there Kirby, but he wouldn’t act that cruel by any stretch of the imagination.&quot;<br>Why does a character ostensibly from Smash Bros. know a meme relating to the Kirby dub? <br><br>More tomorrow, when I&#39;m not sleepy.</p>

            <p>Like Tira said, your writing still suffers from what the pony fandom calls &quot;Lavender unicorn syndrome.&quot; It&#39;s OK to refer to your characters by name most of the time and by the appropriate pronoun most other times.<br><br>-&quot;...Not!Luigi apparently had the Scrappy ability, allowing his Fighting-type moves to hit Ghost-types;...&quot;<br>Um...no. If he&#39;s in the Smash Bros. verse, Backslash should be dealing with the Not!Luigi fight as a Shulk clone, not as a Honedge gijinka. Same goes for the realization about No Guard and Green Missile equating to a Body Slam <strike>(by the way, it&#39;s much closer to a Skull Bash or Headbutt)</strike>.<br><br>-&quot;The humanized Sword Pokémon slammed into the opposite all, and before he could raise his Monado to defend himself, Not!Luigi had begun pummeling him...&quot;<br>One, opposite <i>wall</i>. Two, &quot;Not!Luigi <i>began</i> pummeling him...&quot;. Three, Backslash has a name (of sorts), so please use it.<br><br>-&quot;“Why not just use Amiibos?

Good luck getting them to the PPC, though; amiibo (note the lowercase a) are in pretty high demand throughout World One, as far as I know. Also, given what the crash dummies go through, your solution might be a little too expensive for comfort.<br><br>Heh-heh, maybe I should&#39;ve taken you up on beta-reading this after all. XD Seriously, thank you for doing this mission, and I look forward to your master plan for Falchion and co.</p>

            <p>First off, I am so sorry that I couldn&#39;t get to this and the other concrit responses sooner, as I was working with my family on a yard project and couldn&#39;t come online. Anyway, I&#39;ll try to be quick with answering your questions before I dash off to campus...<br><br>To paraphrase the Wiki, Backslash was an AU version of Shulk as an anthropomorphic Pokemon (and yes, I made up the snippet from his homefic), so he&#39;s technically a Honedge gijinka with Shulk&#39;s appearance, and therefore wouldn&#39;t be any more OP than Falchion would be. One thing I should&#39;ve noted sooner was that Backslash does not use the actual Monado Arts or Xenoblade attacking moves, but the closest analogs from the Pokemon moves. He can also use only four moves on any occasion: Pursuit, Aerial Ace, Shadow Sneak, and one of his status moves at a time. (And yes, I&#39;m aware of how aggressive he is - He&#39;s gonna be toned down via character development in future missions).<br><br>Fixed, and fixed. The reason he knows of the Kirby dub? FicPsych. XD I did say he spent a few days there, didn&#39;t I?<br><br>Good point. I changed it up to say, &quot;Smash Bros. doesn&#39;t take type effectiveness or abilities into account&quot; or whatever. Also fixed. And yeah, I should&#39;ve known that amiibos are crazy rare, so that&#39;s changed too.<br><br>Thank you for your feedback and concrit, all in all. And you are more than welcome to beta-read the next mission I have for these two! :)<br><br></p>

            <p>Good job on the mission!  I have to confess, Whitney reminds me a lot of <a href="http://www.rhymes-with-witch.com/rww06132013.shtml">this Rhymes With Witch strip</a>.  (Warnings for gore.)  <br><br>I really like the vibe that Whitney and Backslash have going as a team.  The main issue I had with the mission is that you tend to use overly long epithets for the characters. &quot;The Sword Pokémon-slash-Homs&quot; is a particularly notable one, as you use it multiple times.  I know it&#39;s a little harder with Backslash, since he doesn&#39;t think of himself by that name, but it&#39;s a trend that occurs in all your missions, not just this one.  Don&#39;t be afraid to repeat character names or use pronouns.  (Confession - this is the reason I made a pair of agents of different genders, so that it&#39;d be easier to keep track of who&#39;s who.)  Also, I think you could have incorporated the &quot;Alternate Ending&quot; into the main fic, but that&#39;s just me being pedantic.<br><br>Overall, I really enjoyed this mission!  Maybe I just have weird taste, but it&#39;s probably my favorite of your missions.</p>

            <p>Thank you for the kind words :) I honestly wasn&#39;t expecting that much from this mission because this means I now have like what, four RCs now? XD Anyway, Whitney&#39;s &quot;action girl&quot; shtick was based on the WFT&#39;s Memetic Badass treatment by the fandom in general, but she certainly won&#39;t go as overboard as in that comic - like E.V.L., she always goes for the quickest, most efficient means of assassination. Even then she trumps Glitter Girl in that department a bit because she doesn&#39;t like using weapons unless required and unless she can bring her Header into play, she often has to rely on her bare hands alone. I&#39;ll try to give just as many kills to Backslash, though, and put Whitney in tight spots as often as her partner, so she doesn&#39;t look TOO good.<br><br>Glad you liked the mission - these two will be back soon, and I&#39;ll keep your style advice in mind! I&#39;ll have to find another fic for them, though, and aside from IRL stuff I have my main RCs to focus on first as well. My horse and his demon in particular have quite a backlog to sort out... starting with the cleanup job in the wake of a certain Legendary Badfic...</p>

            <p>So I&#39;ve spent the last two days watching Smallville and am most of the way through season 1. If you haven&#39;t seen the show, I would definitely recommend because it is really great and has that fun early Buffy vibe.<br><br>But anyways. One thing really gets on my nerves. The show is set in Smallville, Kansas. Every few episodes, characters will go visit Metropolis. The problem is that this show assumes that Metropolis is only a few hours away from Smallville when in DCU canon (at least in the comics) Metropolis is on the New Jersey Coast. Gosh, it just really bothers me.</p>

            <p>It&#39;s a running joke between AIS faculty here (Chinook, Wampanoag, and Okanogan) that almost all sacred sites are named things that, in their own tongue, translate to things like &quot;Over there,&quot; &quot;by the river,&quot; &quot;right here,&quot; &quot;a little way past the big rock,&quot; and so on. <br><br>Does it really matter, if everyone knows what you&#39;re talking about?

            <p>So I have been playing around with a few different Agent ideas for a while now and I have two pairs currently in the works, one pair, I do not think has anything inherently wrong with them though, if you disagree let me know.  The first prospective team is a Pureblood Sith Apprentice from Star Wars:  The Old Republic.  The other is a currently low ranked Bleach Soul Reaper.  I understand that this might get a bit too powerful, but I think I can make it work.<br><br>It is really the other pairing that is giving me concerns and that is why I figured I would poll the community to see what they think.  One of them is Cipher-7 which I have introduced a few times previously, but basically an Imperial Agent from SWTOR.  Nothing wrong I really see with her.  The other one is the question.  I was thinking of maybe running with a Pokémon Agent, and what eventually came to mind was a Mewtwo.  And that&#39;s the question.  What do you all think?  Can a Mewtwo Agent work?  Or is it, by its own nature in its canon, too powerful to be an effective agent?  If it makes any of you feel better, I do have a fairly in depth arc in the works for a Mewtwo Agent.  <br><br>Just wondering what your thoughts are.  </p>

            <p>If you&#39;re talking about a version from the video games, then Mewtwo is just a powerful Pokemon.  There&#39;s no specific indication that it necessarily has any powers beyond that.  In the anime, however, it&#39;s an incredibly powerful psychic, and having a Mewtwo agent would be a little questionable.  But power levels aren&#39;t really all that important.<br><br>The main issue I see with that is its in-universe backstory, though.  Where did this Mewtwo come from?  Technically it&#39;s a unique Pokemon; there isn&#39;t really &quot;a&quot; Mewtwo in canon so much as &quot;the&quot; Mewtwo.  It&#39;s not like a Pikachu or something where the character could theoretically be a &quot;canon bit.&quot;  So it would have to be a Character Replacement.  This can be a good backstory, and also a way to tone down its abilities.<br><br>Overall, I guess what I&#39;m wondering is <i>why</i> you want to write these characters.  I&#39;ve seen you talk a lot about their power levels - and they&#39;re all pretty powerful - but I feel like you haven&#39;t said much about their personalities.  While I understand that you don&#39;t want to spoil things for us, it&#39;d be nice to have a sense of what drew you to these characters in the first place.  Otherwise, it comes off a little like you&#39;re only picking them because they&#39;re powerful.</p>

            <ol>
<li>Imperial Agent: Main reason, was I felt like the agent would be able to be plugged in well into the PPC and could have interesting interactions.<br><br>2.  Mewtwo:  Came from a discussion some time ago about Pokémon Agents.  The question was posed about how/what would cause a Pokémon to willingly go against humans, since the main premise of the canon is humans and Pokémon working together in concert.  I thought that at least the backstory of the Mewtwo from the Anime would work well for that.  Now while not necessarily a bit character the anime seems to indicate that there are at least two separate Mewtwos in existence, namely the one from the First Movie and then the one from the Genesect film.  Both act slightly differently, the latter also has a female voice, and possessed no memory of Ash and Co., thus leading me to believe that it is probably a different Mewtwo.  Further there are at least 9 Mewtwos from the games, so I was more so thinking along the lines of a game Mewtwo whose cartridge was reset.  <br><br>And I was thinking that an interesting story would come from the originally hating humans (or at least its trainer, think max power frustration), to eventually working together in harmony with them, essentially meeting the initial tone of the Pokémon Series.  Mewtwo also happens to be probably my favorite Legendary Pokémon and third favorite overall.  And seeing that there is already a Lucario in the PPC, in order to have some degree of uniqueness, and considering a Charizard would be slightly more difficult to explain, I thought Mewtwo might be a decent choice.  Further, I think a Mewtwo can have a lot of interesting side-stories.  Because for me, those seem a lot more interesting to write rather than missions.<br><br>3.  Sith Warrior:  The main impetus for this character comes from the mailbox RP a little while ago.  I found the condescension from the majority of Time Lords very entertaining.  And I was thinking, &quot;What might clash well with the entire race?&quot;  So I thought about for a while and came up with a race from my own personal favorite canon, Star Wars.  Sith Purebloods, basically think anyone who is not a Sith Pureblood is trash, especially if they cannot manipulate the Force.  And as seen in SWTOR even if one does have the ability to manipulate the Force there is still a good chance they will still think of non-Purebloods as inferior.  So I thought that a Sith Pureblood would be a very nice foil to the majority of the PPC&#39;s Time Lord Agents.<br><br>Further, I like to challenge myself when I write, and I have not previously ever written a character who does things for the Evulz.  And so I wanted to give myself a challenge, so a Sith seemed like a good way to do it.  I also think that he will work well as a foil to my final agent.<br><br>4.  Soul Reaper: Originally I had decided that if I was going to write a character like the Sith, I would need an agent who can stand up to him, restrain his worst instincts and the like.  A Jedi is the obvious choice, but that&#39;s why I decided against it.  Too obvious, and frankly, if they were working together by the end of it, one would almost certainly end up killing the other.  So I wanted to think of something else, and I figured that a Soul Reaper could work.  See the way I see it, since the Zanpakuto is an extension/manifestation of the Soul Reaper&#39;s Soul, it is pretty hardy, and as such based around the kind of things that a Zanpakuto can take before breaking, I think it is within reason to suggest that it can resist a Lightsaber in combat if need be.<br><br>That allows the Soul Reaper to intervene if the Sith tries to attack someone.  Further, I see a lot of interesting stories that I can write about this Soul Reaper.  Namely I see a whole section where he finally will achieve Bankai.  Further since I see him entering the PPC some ponit prior to at least the 1000 Year Blood War Arc, he will have a lot of interesting reactions once he discovers the weekly releases of <i>Bleach</i> and more importantly once he learns about things that happen during that arc.<br><br>Does that help?  I only mention power levels in the OP like I did because that is what I am concerned about.  It seems to me that for all intents and purposes,  that once a character hits a certain power level, they essentially become per-se invalid.  And I am just trying to ensure my prospective agents do not hit that level.  But suffice it to say, I have interesting story arcs already vaguely sketched for each one.<br></li>

            <p>With regards to the Mewtwo, I think you make a good point, but I&#39;m still a little dubious about using such a rare Pokémon.  I&#39;ll confess that part of my motivation is my interest in Pokémon mythology, under which Mewtwo could qualify as semi-divine.  What about an Alakazam or something?  Then you would have the same feel of a highly powerful and intelligent Psychic-type, but without bordering on being Speshul.  I can see lots of reasons for a Pokémon to not be fond of humans; abusive trainers aren&#39;t unheard-of, after all.  Or maybe it was close to its trainer, who then released it after being pressured to by Team Plasma?  Or if it&#39;s from a game cartridge that was reset, there&#39;s no reason a non-Mewtwo Pokémon wouldn&#39;t feel bitter about that.<br><br>Honestly, as for the Sith Warrior, I&#39;m not sure an agent who can only be stopped from killing people by their partner is the best choice.  An arrogant, evil agent is fine, even a potentially murderous one.  But if they can&#39;t restrain themselves then frankly they start to fall into the Stupid Evil trap.  I&#39;m not saying it can&#39;t be done well, but without seeing it in action I&#39;m a little dubious.<br><br>Sorry if this comes off as overly bossy.  I&#39;m not a Permission Giver, so it&#39;s not like you have to take my advice or anything.  Those are just some issues I see with the concepts.<br><br>On a side note, if you&#39;re still looking for betas when you&#39;re ready to submit your Permission Request, I&#39;d be more than willing to help out with that.</p>

            <p>As for Mewtwo, it really comes down to more or less which Pokémon I like and do not. It was never really about power per-se, it was that as I said, Mewtwo is one of my favorite Pokémon.  As I said Lucario has been done, Charizard does not seem like it would fit quite as well, Gyarados would need to be in a human disguise almost exclusively, Gallade is a possibility, though there is a Gardevoir already in the PPC.  Haxorus might be possible.  But see, I am also looking for something that can communicate without the need for a translator with at least its partner, i.e., either in English naturally or through telepathic communications.  And the Pokémon that can do that are heavily limited.  But ultimately it is irrelevant for now, because I&#39;m focusing on the second pair for now.<br><br>As to the Sith Warrior, I oversimplified it.  What I am really going for is someone who is basically a true Sith.  His anger and hatred are all very near the surface, and it does not take much to set him off, hence the need for a &quot;control&quot; partner, one who can stand in and take the brunt of the Sith&#39;s rage, preventing it from spilling out.  But in most cases he really does not attack most things on sight, for much the same reason most people do not crush a stray ant.    Does that clear it up a bit better?</p>

            <p>But I kind of plan on doing something similar with Aaron.  Basically, he can put things in his inventory, which causes them to disappear from sight.  Unfortunately, he can&#39;t access it outside of HQ or his home continuum (in part because his disguise covers his Pipboy).  As far as his partner&#39;s concerned, this is some kind of strange, and potentially incredibly useful, magic; as far as he&#39;s concerned, it&#39;s perfectly normal.  He also baffles her with his ability to effortlessly haul around 200+ pounds of gear and actually enjoy Cafeteria food (at least it&#39;s radiation-free).<br><br>Personally, I find the intersection between game mechanics and storytelling to be hilarious, probably as a side effect of reading Order of the Stick.</p>

            <p>It looks like it&#39;s going to be a Gaia-only thing, alas, but I gave it a trial run (i.e. I recreated Nume&#39;s avatar) and everything looks pretty good. There&#39;s no sort-by-color button, but you can use multiple search terms to look for stuff like &quot;green glasses&quot; or whatever. Plus, you can view the character in both genders and from all angles, both standing and kneeling, which is kinda cool.<br><br>If you want a Gaia-style avatar, but don&#39;t feel like making a Gaia account, I will take requests. Useful information includes hair color and style, eye color and shape, general expression, skin tone, clothes style/colors, additional stuff like glasses, jewelry, tattoos, scars, horns, wings, etc., and any potential handheld objects that symbolize what they&#39;re all about. I can&#39;t promise how quickly I&#39;ll be able to fulfill them—the next couple of weeks I know I&#39;m going to be pretty busy <s>and hopefully publishing some things</s>—but I&#39;ll do my best. I like making these guys. ^_^<br><br>Apologies to Alleb for bumping her lovely poem off the front page to make this announcement. {= (<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>My browser hates Gaia, and it takes forever to load anything.  And without being able to sort by color, it takes forever to go through the hair and eye options.  It&#39;s nice to know there&#39;s a replacement, but it just doesn&#39;t work for me as well as Tektek did.  I&#39;ll probably just stick with my anime-style images.<br><br>Although, it is nice to have my suspicions vindicated that Gaia was getting ready to come out with their own.  Some research I did suggested that there were other issues between them and Tektek, but I&#39;d bet that was one of the factors motivating the C&amp;D.</p>

            <p>Scrolling through this Board, I see quite a few interesting and peculiar names, and I&#39;d like to know two things: one, why was that particular name chosen? Two, how did you come to think of it?<br><br>To start off, my name comes from a trilogy called <i>The Door Within</i>. An Alleb Knight in the particular world of that series, the Realm (which is technically a mirror of our world), is a person who has sworn to follow King Elium- God.

            <p>I used to frequent a gaming client called Byond back in my RP days, way in back the yonder times of three years ago. There was one game in particular called <i>Mitadake High</i> (every bit as anime as it sounds) which I used to play almost daily. It was great fun, but the gender of the character you played as was linked to your profile and I liked a little bit of variety.<br><br>So, long story short, came up with a female profile which I called Doureimi (phonetically doe-ray-mee, because this was during my musical phase), then since everyone I knew had at least three accounts, I went ahead and gave her a male twin, Fasoula (fah-soe-lah) whose purpose turned out to be gathering digital dust. I decided a couple years later, though, that I liked the sound of the name and made it my all-purpose internet name.<br><br>As for my old name: Matthew was the name of one of the primary characters of a story I gave up on years ago. 72 is a number I picked out of my birth date that happened to rhyme with Matthew.</p>

            <p>A friend of mine requested OCs for a story when I was relatively naive as far as fanfiction goes. I wracked my brains and came up with a centaur named &#39;Kitty Eden&#39;. It was accepted into the story, and I enjoyed reading the author&#39;s portrayal of the character so much that she snuck into some of my stories, as a background character. Somehow, I started using Kitty as a screen name instead of my real name- which is, of course, ▋▋▋▋▋. And it ties in nicely with my actual username, which is &#39;TheBigCat&#39;.

The name is like that because, well, there&#39;s no canon word for &#39;eagle&#39; in <i>Dovahzul</i> and names, like shouts, must always be in three syllables, because, according to lore, in this language words have power, and names can also be shouted, in which case, it serves to call upon the wielder of that name, who if is a <i>dovah</i>, a dragon, will take it as a challenge.

            <p>But the question is, <i>am</i> I a dragon? I&#39;ve got &#39;wing&#39; in my name... ^<em>^<br><br>As for your name... oh, dear. I&#39;m afraid I have to break it to you that your name is a horrible linguistic mashup: <i>Edhel</i> is Sindarin, but <i>istar</i>... is Quenya. The Sindarin would be <i>ithron</i>. (This means you&#39;re on the same level as... oh, &#39;television&#39;? That&#39;s a Greek-Latin mashup.<br><br>So your name would be either <b>Edhelithron</b> in Sindarin or <b>Eldastar</b> in Quenya (Elda + istar; could also be &#39;Eldistar&#39;, but that doesn&#39;t have a good <i>lámatyávë</i>, the &#39;sound-taste&#39; by which the Eldar selected their names).<br><br>As for Adunaic, there are two words meaning &#39;wizard&#39;, so you can have either <b>Nimirzigûr</b> or <b>Nimirsapthân</b>. I think the former sounds better (and isn&#39;t beleagured by the pronunciation issue of the latter - the &#39;p&#39; is often said as an &#39;f&#39;), but <i>zigûr</i> is the word used of Sauron, so you may disagree. ^</em>^<br><br>Attested Telerin Quenya is a bit thin on the ground, but we know the first element would be &#39;Ello-&#39;; you can either assume &#39;istar&#39; is still valid, or go for the attested word &#39;Bala&#39;, meaning &#39;Vala&#39; (a bit of an upgrade!). &#39;Ellobala&#39; sounds a bit silly, though, frankly. I think you&#39;d go with &#39;Ellistar&#39;, which is pretty nice.<br><br>In the Black Speech, we need to drop into cultural translation: what&#39;s the equivalent of an Elf to Sauron? Has to be an orc. So you can be <b>Urukûl</b> or <b>Urugûl</b> (both &#39;Orc-wraith&#39;).<br><br>And, purely because I can: the word &#39;Eldar/Edhel&#39; comes from &#39;stars&#39; originally, and it just so happens that there is a <u>Valarin</u> word for the (star-studded) Dome of the Heavens. Since there is also a word for &#39;ainu&#39; (obviously, since they&#39;re the ones speaking it)...<br><br>... you can be <b>Delgûmâyanûz</b>, and hobnob with Mânawenûz and company. ^_^<br><br>hS<br><br>(The closest I can get to my name in Valarin is something like - take a deep breath - <b>Aþâradušamanûðân</b>, &#39;(appointed&gt;) messenger marred&#39;. I... don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be using that. ~hS)</p>

Anyways, I tried to make my screen name, and everything was taken. So I just came up with the single most random, memorable thing I could. Ratbrainbasher is usually what I use for things I don&#39;t mind being unsecured, because it lets people find me easily across games and forums. I think I got the inspiration from an Andy Griffiths book I grabbed off the shelf when I was pretending to work. It was a demented, crude, yet funny choose your own adventure book, and part of it involved a rat, you and a rolling pin. I don&#39;t know why I named myself after that.</p>

            <p>I saw that not many people did did multi-dimensional beings very well, especially in fanfic. I wanted to have a crack at it, so I did what I usually do when making a character: find archetypes. I flesh them out later, but I like to see how others have handled certain character types to get some inspiration. While browsing TV tropes for multi-dimensional organisations, I came across the PPC article. I was intrigued, and decided to check it out for myself. Because I was looking for how to make a World-Jumper at the time, I decided to call myself such. Since then, I have used it for many other websites, and has become my semi-official username.<br><br>And, before you ask, no. I have not written a single thing with him yet. I&#39;ve been trying to, but I just can&#39;t work it out. One of these days...</p>

            <p>That&#39;s a gerund &#39;jumping&#39;, with of course &#39;arda&#39; meaning &#39;bounded realm&#39;.<br><br>You can also have Capimarda, with &#39;jumps&#39; rather than &#39;jumping&#39;, giving &#39;(one who) jumps worldishly&#39;.<br><br>Ardavanta is (one who) walks the world. Or there&#39;s Imbimar, &#39;between worlds&#39;. That&#39;s nice and short, and probably sounds best of all of them. It can also be translated &#39;world of valleys&#39;, or taken as a long form of <i>Imbar</i>, &#39;solar system&#39;.<br><br>~~~~~<br>But of course, there&#39;s very few valid reasons to use Quenya, so let&#39;s look at Sindarin. We can actually create exact cognates for the best choices above (because &#39;leap&#39; is attested in both languages).<br><br>Cabelerdhyn means &#39;(one who is) jumping worlds&#39;. Imerdhyn is &#39;between worlds/worlds of valleys&#39; again, and can also be read as &#39;I (am) worlds&#39;.<br><br>I&#39;d probably go with &#39;Imbimar&#39; and &#39;Imerdhyn&#39;, myself. The emphasis in both is on the second syllable (Im-BIH-mar, Im-ER-thin), and &#39;Imerdhyn&#39; has a bonus advantage of sounding suspiciously like a name for Merlin...<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Superfluity means an over abundance. <br>I found this word when I was trying to find the term for a group of nuns. I was looking for something similar to the names for groups of animals i.e.: murder of crows, school of fish, etc. Eventually I came upon Superfluity from this book written about two hundred years ago in England that was basically a book about the names of groups of things.<br>I just really like the word and I thought that it was more mature as a username than some of the other names that I&#39;ve used in the past.</p>

            <p>I was 10, and used mostly the same username and password for everything. Both were based on my name, and I used them for a while. It was secure, though, because I sometimes swapped the username and password! (Yeah, I&#39;m not kidding when I said I was dumb.)<br><br>At this point, I was playing lots of browser-based games, in which I mostly used the aforementioned username and password (except for Club Penguin, where I had to use a different username for some reason I don&#39;t quite remember). I eventually came across one in particular: it claimed to be &quot;the most interactive web game&quot;, and was a &quot;real-life-based&quot; penguin simulator. Didn&#39;t know that penguins had guns, industry, stock markets and slave labour.<br><br>So, I naturally found it to be the most awesome thing ever. However, I didn&#39;t pick my usual username for... Some reason. I think it might have been because I wanted to do some RP and decided an all-letter name was better for that, but I&#39;m not really sure. So, I picked &#39;domirossi&#39;. Also based on my name, but I was still stupid.<br><br>I used that site for around two years, and then I got tired of it and deleted my account. (Incidentally, I&#39;ve just checked it and it&#39;s still a thing! There&#39;s no one on there anymore, though.) However, I had started to use this name for some other games, and it eventually became my &quot;use-it-everywhere&quot; username. The only times I don&#39;t use it are when I don&#39;t want people I know to find it (such as my Tumblr account).</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve never had a proper nickname. Never. Not in school, high school, college, nothing. And, since my circle of friends was so heavily restricted, I&#39;ve never socialized with other enough to earn me any type of name.<br><br>For a long time, I was using a combination of my first and last name, which resulted in MacBud. Over the course of time, it started sounding stupid so I&#39;ve decided to use the Joker (I still do, when at conventions).<br><br>And about the current one? Well <i>Matt</i>, or &#39;Matthias&#39; is the closest English equivalent of my actual name - Maciej (pronounced Mat-yey). And <i>Cipher</i> is because of &quot;Gravity Falls&quot; and the character, Bill Cipher. I don&#39;t know why I&#39;ve decided on this, I don&#39;t even particularly like Bill, the whole concept just seemed to work.</p>

            <p>Comes from when I was twelve and a huge Runescape addict. I wanted my character to have a normal name, not &#39;CamelotOrc&#39; (Yes, that was my first&#39;s name. Yes, I still remember that. Shut up.), but the filters were sneaky little things and I played around with letters for a bit before settling on Iximaz. After a  while, I just started adopting it as my internet name. <br><br>My first name on here was RinaAndRanda (Rina), which should be fairly self-explanatory. After the Randa half lost interest in missions, I decided to pick up a different name and went with this.</p>

            <p>My father and I would play it often back around middle school. I played a warrior named Be0w01f, and I wanted to be a barbarian! I mean, I was only doing f2p at the time, but I would upgrade some day! My father, his character was, I kid you not, Bimbett. A beautiful blonde woman (though occasional redhead, just to mix things up) who totally trolled guys into giving her things. He was one of <i>those</i> guys. Not creeping or anything, just taking advantage of the inherent sexism of the players. <br><br>I remember, he became friends with this one girl (they were guild mates before there were official guilds) and she was very upset one time. Turns out, her &quot;boyfriend,&quot; who she only interacted with in the game, was breaking up with her. Never met, never saw each other&#39;s face, just typed text onto a box. My father reminded her that their relationship was not really real. How, you may ask? Well, he reminded her that all players were just, and I quote, &quot;Pixelated Pixies.&quot; We laughed so hard together over that phrase. He played up that being a bimbo so hard. It was great.<br><br>...Man, brb, checking to see if our accounts still work.</p>

            <p><i>Enemy Unknown</i> and <i>Enemy Within</i> are two of my favorite games. I was even playing a game using PPC agent names for my soldiers, before I accidentally saved over it. While I&#39;m not normally one to get super-hyped about games (I&#39;ve been burned before by undelivered promises), I can&#39;t help but feel a little excited by what&#39;s being planned.<br><br>I&#39;m curious to know what people think of what is known about the storyline so far. Most of the complaints I&#39;ve seen online (besides the old-school XCOM fans complaining about how the newer ones were dumbed down) have been regarding this &quot;aliens won the war&quot; angle. Personally, that&#39;s one of the things I&#39;m most pleased about. It strikes me as a really interesting concept as well as a useful way of making sure the player has something to build up for. I see it as not undoing the end of the original; it&#39;s an alternate universe. (Not to mention it&#39;s given me some interesting story ideas for XCOM operative turned PPC agent James Pittman…)</p>

            <p>It&#39;s just that when you&#39;re doing stuff that&#39;s been included in a mod, the legality of proceedings suddenly becomes a loooooot more complicated. The changes made to the base game are (very, very technically, and it&#39;s up for considerable debate) the individual modder&#39;s IP, and since Valve&#39;s paid mods debacle showed up there&#39;s actually a little bit of legal precedent to support that idea. This means that you can&#39;t really chuck the functionality from <i>Long War</i> and its integrated UI mods and so forth straight into XCOM 2, which means we&#39;re stuck with vanilla (oh no what a shame and there was much wailing and gnashing of teeth) until the modders do a version of <i>Long War</i> for it.<br><br>Please don&#39;t take this the wrong way - I am still hella hyped for XCOM 2.

            <p>Because I really hope it&#39;s not. For those of you that don&#39;t know, it&#39;s the Matrix sequels for Star Trek: Voyager. I couldn&#39;t find any conclusive evidence that it hasn&#39;t been exiled from continuity, but it gets no acknowledgment later on, either, and pretty much everyone involved with producing it wishes it never happened, so I&#39;m not sure if it should be counted as canon or not.</p>

            <p>Not sure exactly what you mean by Matrix sequels, I&#39;ve never seen those movies.<br><br>As far as its canon status is concerned, it&#39;s never been <i>officially</i> declared non-canon.  According to the <a href="http://www.agonybooth.com/recaps/Star_Trek/Voyager/Threshold.aspx?Page=7">Agony Booth</a>, it was unofficially declared uncanonical, but I&#39;m not sure that&#39;s a particularly reliable source.

            <p>I&#39;m doing some stuff involving trek, and I&#39;d really like to pretend this episode never happened. On two other notes, you are mostly correct, as Tom Paris turns into a newt, not a lizard. Same difference, though. As for the Matrix sequels, well, best to pretend those never happened. If you mention them around a Matrix fan, it&#39;s said that they grow fur and fangs, and are driven into a rage as they attempt to track down and destroy all known copies of the sequels. But, yeah, I&#39;ll just ignore Threshold. I doubt anyone on here would have a problem with that.</p>

            <p>So let me get this straight: All Redwall Minis, even ones spawned from Cornflower and Salamandastron, look like Deepcoilers? Is that true of other franchises? That all Minis in one franchise take on the same form, no matter which character or place they spawn from?</p>

            <p>You need to play it! It is amazing. And it&#39;s very often of sale, so you can pick up the Ultimate edition for round-about $10. Very much worth it, I&#39;d say.</p>

            <p>If so, I would actually recommend you pick up <a href="https://taleoftwowastelands.com/">Tale of Two Wastelands.</a> It&#39;s a mod that puts <i>Fallout 3</i> in <i>New Vegas&#39;s</i> &quot;engine,&quot; for lack of a better word. You start in 3, so if you want to play just <i>Fallout 3</i>, you totally can, no problems. It usually gives <i>Fallout 3</i> some much needed stability and mechanics upgrades. It is a little tricky to set up, but they have detailed instructions on their website that should help you out. I have put a couple hundred hours in TTW, and have not regretted a second of it.<br><br>Some fair warning, you do need legit copies of both, with every piece of DLC. If you have the Ultimate or GotY editions, you should be fine. </p>

            <p>Hello, PPC!<br>For the handful of you who have been here for at least two years, the subject line should be familiar.<br><br>For the rest of you, read on! Since I&#39;m using an idea from a previous post, I&#39;ll use what I said then, with a few corrections/updates in brackets:<br><br><i>To think, that a series of stories created by two American girls, which parodied bad LoTR fics, would expand into a multi-fandom, intercontinental community such as the PPC currently is! So, of course, the obvious question: How diverse are we?<br><br>From the posts I’ve read, it appears that we have at least<br><a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=239183;">one Haitian-American</a> (yours truly)<br><a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=239167;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">one Italian</a><br></i>[<a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=251637;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">two</a>]<i> <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=244063;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">Brits</a><br></i>[and even <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=257873;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">an American Brit</a> (BTW: to our fellow Boarders across the pond, are hyphenated nationalities a thing over there?)]<br>[<a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=244821;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">one American-Canadian-Israeli</a>]<i><br><a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=244655;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">one Malaysian</a><br>one Israeli, given that <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YP6NtLUn90slDtXeuvIF6C0AUqxCqI1ZEjCupVjYuTw/edit">his agent counterpart apparently knows some Hebrew</a> </i>[and given that he&#39;s mentioned <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?id=199610;article=276426;search_term=IDF">that he&#39;s with the IDF</a>]<br>[and quite a few others that I won’t try to list].<i><br><br>Obviously, this cannot be the exclusive list of all the countries represented on the PPC Board!

            <p>When my dad and I went to visit ASU last October, we were both wearing shorts and t-shirts because it was pretty warm compared to the already freezing temperatures from where we&#39;d come. And everyone was telling us we&#39;d come at a great time because it was cold. XD<br><br>I do like the dry heat of Arizona (I have family in Phoenix- maybe I&#39;l have to plan a Gathering next time I visit!) much more than the muggy humidity of Florida.

            <p>I was half-expecting <i>you</i> to be the one to answer the question I left in the body of my post.<br><br>I&#39;m truly curious: just like an American of foreign heritage is a &quot;hyphenated American&quot;; is there such a thing as a &quot;hyphenated Brit/Englishman/Welshman/Scotsman&quot;? &quot;American-British&quot; looks off to me, but that may be because &quot;American&quot; is on the wrong (from my perspective) side of the hyphen.<br><br>(P.S.: To everyone else, I know that the term &quot;hyphenated American&quot; historically carried a negative connotation, but I am not aware if that negative connotation still applies nowadays. Please feel free to correct me if I am in the wrong.)</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve mostly seen it in the form &#39;White British&#39;, &#39;Black British&#39;, &#39;Asian British&#39;. I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s used much outside of demographic surveys, but could easily be wrong.<br><br>&#39;American-British&#39; probably wouldn&#39;t be a thing because American and British are both nationalities -- neither are an ethnic group. Some people do hold both nationalities (our children, for instance), but I&#39;ve never seen anyone make a particular fuss about it.</p>

            <p>Tragedy! Crisis! Other exclamations of dismay! Once again, many of the Citizens and Knights of the Union of Plort have not received their customary honours. Their names are not listed in Baron Huinesoron’s Cyclopaedia; their coats of arms go unblazoned; their histories are unknown to even those closest to them. Clearly, this cannot go on.<br><br>Or, in other words:<br><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/UnionPlortFlag.png"><br><br>Welcome back to Konti-Nyuum.<br><br>The Protectorate of Plort, Konti-Nyuum, is not a PPC AU. Rather, it’s a PPC <i>Community</i> AU - an answer to a question that was never asked:<br><br><b>What if the PPC Community was a medieval nation?</b><br><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/Konti-Nyuum%202015.png"><br><br>So here we are. The island of Konti-Nyuum lies to the north of the great continent of Weab. On this cliff-walled rock the noble knights Jay and Acacia made their home, building the Protectorate of Plort, and those who came after them have carried the Protectorate through its trials and troubles to the current Union of Plort. The Knights of Plort sally ever forth against the hosts of the Marizu, seeking to defend the beleaguered nations of the Scholars’ Empire from their scourge.<br><br>If you&#39;ve been to Plort before, there are a few changes this year - and a few new goodies. ^<em>^<br><br>-&lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://plort.wikia.com/wiki/Protectorate">http://plort.wikia.com/wiki/Protectorate</a></em>of<em>Plort</em>Wikia&quot;&gt;The Cyclopaedia has a Wiki!</a> This exchanges the impossible-to-search Google Doc version with an impossible-to-browse Wiki; whether you think that&#39;s a good change is up to you. Almost everything from the old version is in there, and I&#39;ll be filling in the last bits (mostly departed barons) as time passes.<br><br>-The <a href="http://plort.wikia.com/wiki/File:PlortWorld.png">world map</a> has been created - and tweaked. Notably, the Scholars&#39; Empire is <b>now on Weab</b>, not sequestered away somewhere. The Marizu League is attacking it directly. The Scholars&#39; Empire represents the positive side of fandom, while the Marizu are the negative side.<br><br>There is also another known nation of the Western Continent, which - like the So Shall Medea - is making incursions into Weab. This is Guggle, and it has already taken over Yu&#39;Tub. Not that everyone thinks it&#39;s a bad thing - the folk of Godreve and the farms along the Gu-Gel river are quite enamoured with it.<br><br>-<a href="http://plort.wikia.com/wiki/Plort_in_Other_Media">You can visit Plort!</a> I&#39;ve made versions of Konti-Nyuum in Minecraft and in Civilisation IV; go wild. (The Minecraft version should start you off in Otik; if it dumps you somewhere else, please let me know and I&#39;ll try to fix it.)<br><br><hr>
<br><br>Each and every member of the PPC Community is also a resident of Plort. You can find the autobiographies of everyone who&#39;s done this before in the WikiCyclopaedia (<a href="http://plort.wikia.com/wiki/Huinesoron">mine is here</a>, for example). If you haven&#39;t already written your history, why not join in and give one? There&#39;s a <a href="http://plort.wikia.com/wiki/Beginner%27s_Guide_to_Plort">guide</a> on doing so on the CycloWiki, and a <a href="http://plort.wikia.com/wiki/Glossary">glossary</a> outlining most of the websites and fandoms in the setting.<br><br>For entertainment value, please post your bios here on the Board; if you want to cross-post them to the Cyclopaedia, go ahead, but I&#39;m happy to sort that out for you. A couple of notes:<br><br>-Make sure to choose which of the four nations of the Union you live in, and indeed where in it; there’s nothing wrong with adding small towns and villages wherever you please, or you can live in the cities. Up to you!<br><br>-Everyone can have their own pair of heraldic devices, according to Plort’s two systems as <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CRwK0B70gWO0lJ_TgeiyTEF_l6A6_yyQ2BgH9ATKL6w/edit">described here</a>. If you can describe your device/s, either formally as described there or just vaguely, I’ll (try to) make it for you.<br><br>Nor is this thread limited to bios and heraldry. Anything goes! There will be a Baronial Council going on, which is open for in-character comments by all and sundry; world-building, RP-subthreads, songwriting... anything goes. Basically, use your imaginations - you&#39;re good at that!<br><br><s>hS</s> Huinesoron, by the grace of Kanun Baron and Knight of Plort, Protector of Ozerbord, Custodian of Fanvik-Whirl, Marshal of the Order of Udisc, Scourge of the Marizu, Friend of Medellurth, &amp;c &amp;c &amp;c</p>

This has been voted into law, and the likes o&#39; me mayst not go agin it. But there be more&#39;n good land in this place, milord Baron. There do be more.<br><br>In days passed, the Kingdom&#39;s fine castles were built o&#39; stone an&#39; wood, as are they now. But that stone came from the south, near the joinin&#39; o&#39; the mountains.

This return to old tradin&#39; ways will bring in goodly funds for them as control the tradin an&#39; the sky-fleets, thus allowing fer more improvements to the shipyards around Koewright an&#39; Rheewryght, perhaps even buildin&#39; a market town at Eksoeva fer goods an&#39; chattels ter aid the farmers.

            <p>There could be a town springing up around it and slowly growing, though, if you like. Or nearby, at least. It could start off as housing the workers who <i>build</i> the castle--Eshakhar certainly isn&#39;t going to speak it out of the ground, that would a, be ridiculous, and b, put her in a coma. It could then remain and start growing. The castle would be called either the Castle of Dawn or the Castle of the Dawn; the town...well, if the castle&#39;s okay and you/other people want the town, I&#39;ll think up what it could be. Perhaps the town of Libraerie, or Goch&#39;t (gchat), or something.<br><br>Thoughts?<br><br>~DF<br><br>(PS: I first brought up this idea of a castle in Sittorese <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=277395;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">here</a>, in response to HG&#39;s letter. I haven&#39;t posted the follow-up yet, but it&#39;s basically &#39;Lady Iximaz says it&#39;s fine, etc, etc&#39;. I&#39;ve explained pretty much all of the reasoning for building this thing to begin with there.)</p>

            <p>I think Goch&#39;t/G&#39;chot would be the best name for the town - we&#39;ve got enough of a library theme over in Wechi, and GChat actually has real-world significance to story-writing. The castle can take whatever name you want. So... where do you want it? Pick a spot. ^_^<br><br>hS<br><br>(PS: The only city suggested to have been built entirely by magic is Manyuel - Huinesoron and Neshomeh constructed it using the arts of Eitch-Tee-Em-Ehl or whatever it&#39;s called.)</p>

            <p>Like Huinesoron said, your Plort personal reflects the real you and your interests - Skaer&#39;morys is a Beastmaster because of my own love of fantasy creatures, for example. (And come to think of it, I think a good name for a magic system centered around creature controlling could be simply called Mons, after the Mons Game archetype as defined by TV Tropes.)<br><br>As for the concept itself... perfect, simply perfect ^_^</p>

            <p>...of Dame eatpraylove, the Errant Knight. <br><br>Eatpraylove completed her traditional pilgrimage through the Purmeshon Range and Mountains of Reverence over the  summer and most of the autumn of the year she arrived in Plort. She had heard through Wechi of a barbarian in Fanvik-Neht who claimed to have become a major Pokhemman [adjective form of Pokhemmon] god. Having grown up there, first forged and fought with Chris there, and learned the basics of storytelling there, she took this somewhat personally. (This was part of her drive to become a knight in the first place.)<br><br>When she returned to Borrd and after her victory celebration, she approached the mage-knight Skaer&#39;morys the Silver for assistance. Though he was only somewhat more experienced against the Marizu than she, she wanted to have someone to support her on her first quest.<br><br>Skaer lent her his armored bird, Falchion, and cast a Godrevan ((seems legit, right?)) spell that allowed them to communicate with each other and Falchion by thought. They worked together surprisingly well for relatively new knights, and completed the quest to slay &quot;Tasha&quot; by the end of November.<br><br>She has continued her travels, as always, and is currently tracking down a demon Marizu of sorts. Her thought is that if she uses her new weapon, the Blades of Violet Roses, to strike down the demon, the Blades will lose some of their own Marizu taint.<br><br>(Aside: Pokhemmon, which split off from Vidya Gaym some time ago and is currently negotiating its eastern border with the Confederation, is a small but prominent nation known primarily as a tourism hotspot. Its wild animals are mind-bogglingly diverse and powerful, yet even a child can tame them with the proper tools. Citizens of Pokhemmon worship various animal gods of the land, the sea, the sky, space, time, and life and death itself. They are a friendly, intensely loyal people, ready to defend any slight to them, their heroes, or their culture in battle.)<br><br>(Aside 2: The Grand Republic of Deeay has trade routes that lead to and from it all over Weab, reaching even to Plort in a few cases. That level of accessibility, however, means there is a strong Marizu presence/influence there, possibly stronger than the army. Rumor has it that the Marizu League seeks an alliance with Deeay, or already has one, or seeded the entire cabinet with its double-agents so as to manipulate the Republic. Eatpraylove fears for her homeland&#39;s safety, and prays every day that its citizens stand against and drive out the barbarians.)<br><br><br><br>Eatpraylove&#39;s Equipment<br>Dame eatpraylove is uncomfortable with longswords, and so primarily relies on her long dagger, Chris. Her green mare, Ami, shares her master&#39;s kindness and love of music, at least according to her.<br><br>Her first target, the god-impersonator &quot;Tasha&quot;, possessed a mysterious green fairy she called &quot;Miguel&quot; and a fiery-tempered unicorn named Brenda. With help from Falchion and her (temporary) telepathic link with Skaer&#39;morys, Eatpraylove convinced both that they would be better off serving her.<br><br>Miguel insisted that his mother come too, as Tasha had captured but never actually called on her, or even given her a name. His mother, now named Diane, helps keep the manor clean, while Miguel himself accompanies eatpraylove on her quests as a sort of sentient good-luck charm. (He also knows time-travel spells.)<br><br>The Blades of Violet Roses she received from Skaer&#39;morys, who pulled them from an angel impersonator&#39;s rotting corpse, in exchange for Brenda. A pair of throwing daggers, they take their name from the odd purple sheen and engraved rose patterns on both blades.</p>

            <p>...upon the unusual discovery that I made when retrieving the Blades of Violet Roses, among other things. For it&#39;s actually quite a fascinating tale...<br><br>On my seventh venture beyond the Protectorate of Plort (shortly following the successful domestication of Velociripper the raptor with the aid of Lady Iximaz), I received word of a crisis in the floating sky islands of Kidd Icarrius - a land which I could not believe the scourge of the Marizu was able to touch! And yet, there was one that had infiltrated this sacred realm, under the guise of the lieutenant of its greatest goddess no less! I had to investigate, and so I made my way to the sky islands to investigate<br><br>I discovered an... interesting scenario. The imposter seemed to be impersonating the lieutenant by adding supplementary material to the existing records of said commander, and the worst he was doing was being excessively angsty to make others pity him. With me at the time were Rasheeda, my white lioness, and my Black-Tailed Roc, Squall... but unfortunately, they didn&#39;t get along, and they still don&#39;t. When I tracked the Marizu to Palutena&#39;s Temple, Their noisy bickering attracted the attention of the imposter, who whipped out the Blades of Violet Roses! Instantly, I set my beast and my bird upon him. The fight was short but brutal, and I feared that my companions would actually lose... but then a flash of light seemed to come from the heavens and strike the Marizu down, vaporizing him instantly!<br><br>Was it the goddess Palutena? Perhaps. But my monsters were saved, and that was all that mattered. But when I retrieved the Blades of Violet Roses, I discovered something else...<br><br>There was no corpse of this imposter. I had expected this because the blessed beam had obviously smited the Marizu completely. But inside the otherwise empty toga was a strange, pearlescent egg. Despite Rasheeda&#39;s warning, Squall eagerly approached it and pecked at it with her sharp beak... unintentionally opening a hole in its shell, and allowing the creature inside to break free. It was a baby bird, with fluffy down feathers as white as snow and a comb on his head as red as blood. Peeping in awe and wonder, the baby Caladrius looked up at Squall&#39;s fearsome eyes and hooked bill, and instantly, he knew: This was his caretaker. And I was as well, by extension.<br><br>I named the healing bird Carmine, due to his bright red crest. Along with him, I brought back the Memory Keeper&#39;s Cloak of January, Panacea&#39;s Caduceus - and the Blades of Violet Rose. However, Carmine is the souvenir from this adventure to Kidd Icarius which I treasure most of all. I am not a believer in miracles, but I suspect that the Goddess of Light may have blessed me with one that day. I have even theorized more than once that she herself turned the Marizu into a bird. If that really is the case, then he still owes me an apology for trying to skewer me. For now, though, he and Squall have become the best of friends, and have formed a creche of youngsters together with another recent addition to my bestiary.<br><br>Wait, did I really forget to mention that said recent addition is an eight-foot-long yearling Sea Serpent named Lazuli? No? Oh, dear... So much for my &quot;Help Wanted&quot; advertisement for a monster babysitter...<br><br>(Aside: Kidd Icarius is currently a territory of Vidya Gaym, and its toga-clad citizens worship various gods and angels. Along with a number of other territories, Kidd Icarius is part of the Suma Boros Union, which is seeking to follow in the footsteps of Pokhemmon and branch off from Vidya Gaym as an independent nation.)</p>

</li>
<li>remembering that the Commonwealth of Wechi and the Republic of Iric are what they are, not because the Baronial Council of the Union of Plort decided that this is the best for Plort, but because the people of Wechi and Iric like to have it that way<br>

            <p>Everything has its price. Be it the finest sword in the land, the most exquisite cloth, or a military rank. If you want it, it&#39;s just a matter of price, and finding the right person. And trust me, all ye good lords, Cipher the Merchant King is the person you want to be friends with.<br><br>Originating from the lovely city of Tumblar, Cipher inherited the family business from his father; the old drunkard was a shallow bloke, his only interest was making more gold to spend on rye the same day. After passing away, the young heir decided to move out, close the first shop, and venture into the lands unknown to establish alliances and make some friends. He was led by a vision; a vast network of informants and suppliers, ready to provide with anything the client desires, no matter the cost, or methods. Be it the exchange of favours, investing into small shops, or simply blackmail and threats, as long as it could be used to obtain the goods - Cipher will use it.<br><br>Cipher has no side - his own well-being is the most important for him. He also doesn&#39;t identify himself with any coat of arms, nor a special mark. He is not, however, anonymous. Be it the Union, or the League, his goods (and information he possesses) always go to the highest bidder, and most people know that. There is only one question you must ask yourself, m&#39;lord:<br><br>Are you the highest bidder?</p>

            <p>After a good deal of revision and several attempts to understand the naming systems, here they are! If I&#39;ve mixed something up with the description--ie, if it makes no sense--let me know and I&#39;ll describe it in plain English. For the Elvish arms, I actually made a sketch, which is included (in giant size, because I don&#39;t know how to shrink it. Hurrah!) It&#39;s just meant to give an idea, though, since I&#39;m not completely sure I got the description right and had the sketch anyway. It&#39;s also a little blurry, unfortunately.<br><br><u>Heraldry</u><br><br><b>English:</b> Oval, party per pall purpure, azure, vert. In center, an open book, binding Or with pages argent.

            <p>Thank you so much for making these. Although, I&#39;ve been wondering: how exactly do you make these? Is it a website/generator? Are you using Illustrator and clipart? How does this magic work?<br><br>Secondly, thank you, and hearing that these ones were fun is pretty awesome.<br><br>Third, a couple of adjustments, if you don&#39;t mind.<br><br>The English arms are great, especially the way the edges of the book fit the boundaries of the purple. Speaking of the purple, though, is there any way to get it less red-hued? A little more like a darker version of the purple in the Elvish arms? I think that&#39;s the only thing I want changed there.<br><br>For the Elvish: also fantastic, especially the quills, and though there&#39;s no way you could have known, I like seagulls. Probably too much time around oceans as a kid :) I also like the &#39;flying away from the fire&#39; touch. However, could you shrink them to about half the size? They should remain placed about where their tails currently join their bodies. And also...okay, odd request, but is it possible to change the shape of the blue flames? Or, if not, tilt it so that the wider parts line up with the birds? It, ah. I got it into my head that it looks rather a lot like a cross (one of the very fancy ones, couldn&#39;t tell you which church it belongs to or what the proper name for it is), which is exactly the imagery I <i>don&#39;t</i> want in my arms (no offence at all meant to anyone reading this, but...well, everything in the English arms apart from the colors can also symbolize some part of Jewish tradition, which should tell you something--or several things, really--about me. Crosses <i>really</i> don&#39;t figure into my personal life, and I&#39;d rather they stayed out of my arms.) So, if it&#39;s possible to change that, I&#39;d really appreciate it, because I can&#39;t seem to unsee the cross shape.<br><br>Apart from that...potentially darken the purple in the Elvish arms a little, to make everything else stand out a tiny bit more. I&#39;m fairly sure that would work.<br><br>(Now you see why I didn&#39;t reply immediately--I knew I had a number of requests to make, and didn&#39;t feel like doing it on a tiny screen and with a touchscreen keyboard. But again, thank you <i>so much</i> for making these; they&#39;re completely worth slogging through two sets of heraldry rules in search of understanding.)<br><br>...wait, hold on. I think I must have described the English colors in the wrong order--I swear I meant for the green and the blue to be flipped. Wasn&#39;t there something about them going top, then left? No wonder I&#39;ve been thinking something looked very slightly off.<br><br>Right. Remedied description:<br><br><i>Oval, per pall purpure, vert, azure. An open book in centre Or with pages argent, an olive branch below proper, nine sparks above Or.</i><br><br>And with that, I&#39;m done. And will continue being happy about having heraldry, because it&#39;s really worth being excited about. (Case in point: saw it for the first time yesterday, and promptly walked down the hallway staring at it and smiling). Thank you again, so much.<br><br>~DF<br><br>PS: Out of curiosity, would outlining the birds in black have helped at all?</p>

            <p><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/EshakharArms1_1.png"><br><br>Someone did make a mistake with the English arms - but it was me, not you. I got all tangled up in the fact that the left side of the shield is the <i>dexter</i> side; you start from the right as seen by the holder. I think. I&#39;ve changed it, anyway. And tweaked the purple (which I&#39;d swear was identical to the Elvish purple initially - not sure what happened there!)<br><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/EshakharArms2_1.png"><br><br>Cross ha&#39; gone poof. ^_^ What it looked like was a Teutonic cross, which is actually the same kind I drew on in <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=277211;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">Alleb&#39;s arms</a>. Birds are shrunk to... about half-size, ish. They&#39;ve lost their beaks, but one pixel isn&#39;t much of a sacrifice. They also seem to have black wingtips now! And I&#39;ve darkened the purple a little.<br><br>As to how I make them... MS Paint! A lot of the animals are very-shrunken images from t&#39;Internet, but everything else is just pixel art. It helps that we&#39;ve all got the same sort of hobbies - I&#39;ve spent a lot of time copying feathers and books around! Your olive branch, too, is just a modified version of the kangkung stalk from Critta&#39;s arms. But the birds (both versions) were drawn from scratch. The trick is making the devices small enough that the &#39;details&#39; don&#39;t need much detail...<br><br>hS<br><br>(PS: Um, maybe? I&#39;m red-green colour-blind, so blue and purple just look the same to me. A black outline would, uh, outline some of the blue against the rest of the blue, so I guess so?)</p>

            <p>Okay, I&#39;m now <i>completely</i> satisfied with the Elvish arms. They look absolutely fantastic. Thank you!<br><br>The English is also looking closer to how I want it, I think. One thing--could the olive branch perhaps be shrunk a bit? Sort of...hm. Shrunk and centered under the book? Something about the size of it is bugging me.<br><br>...either that or move it up, unshrunk. Just...something about it bugs me, and I&#39;m not completely sure why. Maybe balance, or something, I don&#39;t know...ach. Art, huh? :)<br><br>Teutonic cross, there we go. My guess was &#39;something vaguely Celtic&#39;, which...seems pretty off, actually, since I remember Teutonic having something to do with Germany. Unless that&#39;s to do with <u>Conrad&#39;s Fate</u> and isn&#39;t, in fact, related. Anyway, thanks verr&#39; much for making it go &#39;poof&#39; :)<br><br>MS Paint? <i>MS Paint</i>? Wow. Also, how. Admittedly, last I checked it&#39;d come a long way from the version I liked to use about ten years ago, but...wow. And those are some pretty great birds to be drawn from scratch. I assume you&#39;re not using a mouse? Or, if you are...yeah, I&#39;d be back to going &#39;<i>How?</i>&#39;<br><br>Color me impressed either way.<br><br>Hm. Okay, then, I&#39;ll take from this that outlines are at least slightly helpful. Hm. /begins plotting flags/<br><br>And thank you again, by the way. This is just...yes.

            <p>I saw it together with the Elvish arms on the Plort wiki page, and it&#39;s looking pretty good.<br><br>Tiny thing, though.

However, I swore to her with the both of us full-knowing that I am a traveler by nature, and will not remain always by her side--a knowledge which is well-suited to milady, as she is herself often abroad. However, any decisions I make must be discussed with her.<br><br>As to the decision: it has been long since my own home was a permanent one. When I first attempted to build for myself a dwelling, it was soon attacked by the Marizu and razed to the ground. This was many years now past; and though I have long been devising plans to at last build my Castle of the Dawn, never yet have I been able to decide the time and place of its construction.<br><br>Perhaps, sir, the time is now: too long have my books and possessions languished in their storing beyond the Mistwall. Too long have I been without a true home of my own. In Keep De&#39;endee I am welcome, and the same is true of numerous towns and cities; but there is truly no place in Plort which I have called my home for longer than a year. My heart would rejoice to have such a place, and the location of this Riding of Sittorese--encompassing the towns of Godreve and Tumblar, in which both I have sojourned and found fair welcome and great contentment--aye, the location pleases me as well.<br><br>And yet--I am sworn to the Lady Iximaz, and must speak first with her. However, I do not believe that she would deny me the construction of a permanent home--it would hardly mean that I would be never by her side, after all.<br><br>With my most sincere thanks, sir, for your letter and for your information;<br>I remain;<br>Eshakhar, Knight of Plort<br><br>--<br>((Aka, this is very intriguing, and it makes sense to me that Eshakhar currently has no permanent home and would like one. The destruction of her attempts to build one in years past mirrors me finding at least one Sue in my earlier stories; and I&#39;ve spent a lot of time on Tumblr, and even more now on Google Drive. And, while she&#39;s sworn her loyalty to Lady Iximaz, I don&#39;t really see it being a problem--the entire idea was &#39;I&#39;m swearing loyalty to you, but with the understanding that you don&#39;t mind me going wandering a lot, since you do the same anyway&#39;. But--yes--I&#39;ll have to discuss it with Iximaz :) It does seem reasonable to me, though.<br><br>Also, hS&#39; description? &#39;Writing of Stories&#39;, co-writes, betaing--especially recently, I&#39;ve been doing a lot of co-writes (they&#39;ll start bearing fruit relatively soon, I think, and certainly over the next half year), and I&#39;ve always done betaing when I can. Honestly, it...seems perfect. I might need a few more details about what it entails Plort-wise, and there is, of course, the understanding that Knight Esh will often be away, but making her permanent home in the new Riding? I like the idea.<br><br>And with that, I must run, I&#39;m expected somewhere nearby in fifteen minutes. But thanks for thinking to approach people whose characters haven&#39;t declared their homes yet! Good thing I&#39;ve been a little slow with the backstory, huh? :)<br><br>~DF))</p>

            <p>About the swords: The difference is that I had expected the edges to be jagged, as if an impact shattered the blade. As it currently is, the edges are straight, as if the sword had been designed that way.<br><br>As for the quill, I vaguely remember you having drawn a quill with different colors for another shield; I think that the feather was a brownish color?

He arrived in time to witness the appointment of his friend as a Baroness, and pledged his life and loyalty to her as a follower. <br><br>Although he does not hold Knighthood, Darkotas is more than prepared to defend his Lady and those she has sworn to protect.

            <p>((Part One is already on the Cyclopedia. Revised Version: To keep the spelling consistent, “rumors” should be “rumours”, unless all tales of Plort should be in American English.))<br><br>“Not much is known about Hieronymus the hermit. He travelled wide and far, looking for a place where to dwell when his livelong journey came near its end. Following rumours about a dreaded plague called the Marizu, and the brave knights who fought this evil, he came to the shores of Wechi. Unseen by anybody, he roamed this vast land for over a year, even sneaking into Arkive and the Hall of Ancient Records. Only when a stranger accused the noble knights of vile malefaction, Hieronymus stepped forward to Borrd to defend their selfless deeds. <br><br>“Since then, he has talked to some of the denizens of Plort, and he began to build his home in Wechi, and to prepare his offerings to Kanun and Spelin, for he pondered to explore the mountain range of Purmeshun, but now he seems to be lost in the wood of Kar’eer. How he got there is still a mystery, for he has never been seen in Iric. <br><br>“Some may conclude that Hieronymus is a fearsome mage who comes and goes of his own volition, and has not revealed his full power yet, while others may believe that he is a leaf in the wind, never knowing where he may be tomorrow, and both may be right, for being self-contradictory is his very nature.<br><br>((Part Two))<br><br>“Over time, rumours spread that the hermit may have left the dark woods to walk the roads and pathways of Plort again.<br><br>“Inhabitants of Ozerbord remember a grey bearded man who appeared at the Games of Batveg, clad in the habit of a harlequin, pretending to be a veritable knight, but fighting the atrocities in other knight’s tales rather than the misdeeds of the Marizu. Of course this fool was laughed out of town.<br><br>“Wordsmiths and Grammagicians at Worhkshap tell tales of a taciturn, grey bearded man wielding a staff – named Androia – in the training sessions for scribe apprentices. Civilians, knights and even barons up and down Plort claim that this very man’s feeble attempts in practising the ancient arts of Beytah may actually have improved their strength.  And nobody shall ever again mention the Quiet Baker-Knight’s weird experience at the Shipfest in a nameless harbour.<br><br>“It is also said that Hieronymus, on his flight from Ozerbord to Worhkshap, passed an unexplored region at the junction of the Wattuf Mountains and the Mountains of Reverence, where he found the Snow Drops, a moste potente potion that helps curing forgetfulness. How these will be used in the future is yet to be seen.<br><br>“Recently, the peasants living in the lands between the rivers Wep and Freewep began to talk about a newcomer, fitting the hermit’s description, amongst the workers sent by Baron Neshomeh to help in repairing the damage caused by the last earthquakes. <br><br>((Thanks to PoorCynic for beta reading so far.))<br><br>“The peasants are probably not mistaken, for one day not far in the past, Hieronymus appeared in the Hall of Ancient Records – as he likes to appear out of the blue – and he bent low, and he spoke up and said, ‘Milady Neshomeh, I travelled wide and far. My eyes are old, and my posterior can not stand perpetually riding against the Marizu. But my mind is still sharp, and my hands don’t tremble. If you would assign me a corner in your castle Arkive, where I can rest and store my staff and flask, I could help you copying and restoring these documents I see are in bad shape and may soon disintegrate into dust. And in case I feel ever fit to follow you into battle, I would appreciate the licence to wear your colour on my shield.’ “<br><br>((Thanks to Neshomeh for beta reading the job application. No thanks for accepting it and sending me off to the wastelands to demonstrate me skill in the craft of Eich-Tee-Ehm-Ehl :-). BTW, Luthy and Sil’s spin-off is up.))<br><br>((Hieronymus the hermit asking for a corner to store his still uncanonical “weapons” implies that Hieronymus the boarder, if he ever asks for and gets permission, would like to have Hieronymus the archivist’s apprentice store his stories in the archive of Lost Tales, skipping the step of having them gone lost elsewhere first.))<br><br>((To Huinesoron: Since Baron Neshomeh didn’t object to the choice of colour: (Neshomeh-)Vert, spectacles Or. Please.))<br><br>((Would choosing the motto <i>Keep it simple</i> anywhere near Neshomeh’s coat of arms make me a horrible person? Well, the blunt worshiping may make up for it.))<br><br>HG</p>

Certainly the case - this looks awesome and it made me want to see whether our other set of arms - the Elven ones - can also be impaled. That&#39;s what I came up with, though I&#39;m not sure whether it&#39;s kosher under the system&#39;s rules:<br>Nis green, rena silver: canta nastar alta cuna, rose leaves; canta nastar alta tera, raven feather with blue highlights; indil in fore, a yellow rose; indil in fore, woven with stems of feathers, circular green braid.<br><br>What do you say, hS?

            <p>Not everybody sticks their nose into every single thing in existence, Hermit. As a rule I prefer <i>not</i> to meddle in others&#39; affairs – unlike you, it would seem. Not to mention that there have been no “weird ideas” concerning the Riding&#39;s governance – just Baron Phobos&#39; usual, transparent attempts at a power grab, the Poor Cynick&#39;s suggestion of appointing an assembly of legislators, and Baron Eagleshadow&#39;s original proposal. The only “weird idea” is yours, that this frankly absurd Wechian way of governance should be further propagated.<br>Furthermore, your perceived grievances against the Baronial Council aside, I am a Baron of this Union and you <i>will</i> treat me with the proper respect. <br>Nonetheless, I shall answer your question: the general populace do not have the merit to rule themselves. Let it be that a series of tests shall be devised according to the qualities desired of the Riding&#39;s rulers, and whosoever passes them with flying colours shall rule the new country. That way, the rulers can be as many or as few as needed, for there is no doubt that this new country requires competent rulers.<br>-Baron Thanasius Ampelius</p>

            <p>Thanasius Ampelius slapped the scroll with an open hand. “I simply do not believe it. First he accuses me of despotism, then he demands that I fix this yet-to-be-born nation’s problems, and now he simply turns tail? Pterry’s Nice Hat, what’s next? He’ll decide to overthrow the Barons and install himself as the sole ruler of this island?”<br><br>“I highly doubt that, Than,” Lady Iximaz sighed, using her belt knife to break open the seal on another scroll. “Hieronymus has never struck me as that type of man; it seems to me as though he simply wants what is best. He just… has an unfortunate way of going about it.” <br><br>“I swear I was this close” — the monk indicated a distance no longer than an inch with his thumb and forefinger — “to going after him and dragging him by the scruff of his neck to Skypcht, to be tried for treason and libel.” He sighed. “He apologised, though.”<br><br>“And yet, for some reason you are not pleased by this,” Iximaz said, showing her knack for stating the obvious.<br><br>“It feels insincere. ‘Apparently I am too stupid to follow your arguments’ — that reeks of passive aggressiveness to me.” Thanasius leaned back in his chair, crossing his hands behind his head and letting his voluminous sleeves fall down.<br><br>Iximaz shrugged. “Perhaps that is the case, but I would appreciate you not having the old hermit thrown in prison. His services as a Beytah are invaluable when I am able to contact him, and I would hate having to find another.”<br><br>“As things are, I think leaving him to rot in Skypcht’s prison would cause a diplomatic incident.” He leaned forward again and dragged his hands down his face in frustration.<br><br>Iximaz set her scroll aside and got up, coming around the table to wrap an arm around Thanasius’ shoulders. “Perhaps that would not be such a good idea, no,” she said dryly.<br><br>“But it is sorely tempting.” He leaned back to touch a finger to Iximaz’s cheek. “Gods give me strength.”<br><br>Iximaz pulled him into a hug. “I trust you will find the strength on your own.”<br><br>Thanasius let her hug him, and she could feel him untense. “May I present a dissenting viewpoint, my lady?” he asked.<br><br>“Of course, Than.”<br><br>“It is not my own strength I rely on.” He looked out of the window and on to the sky. “I think I have learned well enough that with a friend I can be so much more.”<br><br>“Careful, there,” Iximaz said, laughing. “Any more clichéd a sentence and you will be sent to live with the Marizu. I hear they are fond of such things.”<br><br>“Oh, hush, Ixie dearest.” His eyes glinted mischievously. “I hear tell that those damned creatures are not the owners of what lies beneath those clichés.”<br><br>“You’re doing it again,” she deadpanned.<br><br>“I didn’t notice,” he said dryly. “I thought I was saying something extremely witty and original. Was I not, Ixie milady?”<br><br>“Not particularly, Than,” she said, pulling away and moving to pick up Hieronymus’ letter. “So, what do you plan on doing about this?” she asked, waving it slightly.<br><br>“On one hand, he apologised. On the other… I do not forget such slights, milady. I am not one to keep grudges, usually, but when I do, I do not forget.” He sighed again and started looking for a quill. “I think I will terminate this sorry affair. But I’ll be watching him like a hawk from here on.”<br><br>“Not a crow?” Iximaz muttered to herself, going to sit back down.<br><br>“How droll.” Thanasius dried the ink, rolled the parchment and stretched. “Administration and letters are simply my favourite pastime.”<br><br>“Oh, don’t I know it.” Iximaz sighed and propped her chin up on her hand. “How I look forward to the council ending so I might leave for another raid!”<br><br>“I couldn’t have said it better myself.” The monk got up. “Come on, let us go. This room is stuffy and the weather outside looks rather inviting. Would you kindly accompany me on a walk, milady?”<br><br>“Gladly.” <br></p>

            <p>“Fey Alleb was born many a year ago in the Kingdom of Medellurth. Not a day went by that she did not hear the stories of her native land, and long to explore the vast reaches of the world. But Alleb was small and weak, and knew not what a truly terrible place the world can be. When Alleb came of age, she took up her trusty (and rusty) sword, packed a meager lunch, and set off to explore Weab.<br><br>“Dark days followed, for Alleb was yet young and inexperienced, and knew not the terrors of Weab. She wandered far and abroad from Medellurth, venturing into lands both fair and foul. First she came upon Doktaru, and found it good. She settled there for long months, learning better the ways of a knight. But she felt the call of wanderlust, and departed. None bid her farewell.<br><br>“Alleb came next to Air’ihpotre, and though she found the lands sweet and sad, she remained only briefly. For Air’ihpotre reminded her too keenly of her home, and she could not bear it long.<br><br>“Alleb wandered farther away from her beloved Medellurth, till only the memory of it remained. She visisted the lands of Fantropa, Surelock, and Lozz. Finally, when she was weary from her travels, she stumbled into the great and terrible Empire of Fanvik-Neht. Yet she knew not the depths of its evil, or of its foul alliance with the Marizu League. And so Alleb remained there for many years, learning better the ways of her sword, and (thousand curses!) took it up in defense of that dark land! She grew in in the eyes of the Empire, which named her a captain, and she knew not how foul her own deeds were. <br><br>“So it was that Alleb was sent on a secret mission to Plort. She was ordered, by that ever-cursed Marizu League, to scale the cliffs of Konti-Nyuum, and learn all she could of Plort’s defenses. And so, in a small craft, Alleb sailed to Plort and climbed the cliffs of Wechi, marvelling at their breadth and height. After recovering from her climb, she hooded and cloaked herself that she might not be known, and deepened her voice so that she might not be perceived for who she was.<br><br>“And so she went out through Wechi, and into Borrd, bracing herself for the foul-ness of Plort of which she had been warned. But it never came. Where she had expected a dark land, full of terrible deeds and uncouth peoples, she found a happy, thriving country, into which she was welcomed, as it were, with open arms. Alleb then perceived what a fool she had been, and that it was the Empire, not Plort, that was truly dark. She resolved to go to the nearest Baron and seek forgiveness for her wrongdoings, and so came to the Keep De’endee, of fair Lady Iximaz. Lady Iximaz, in her wisdom and mercy, offered Alleb a second chance, which she greedily took. The other peoples of the Borrd, however, are not so sure that Alleb is reformed. They whisper that she is still carrying out her foul errand, and that she plans to assassinate the courageous Lady Iximaz. <br><br>“Some even go so far as to claim that she serves neither Plort nor the Empire, but a third Kingdom, great and terrible in its power, yet unseen. They say that the symbol Alleb wears upon her neck, and the device on her heraldry, that of a golden cross, bodes of.. something. But of what, they cannot say. All that is truly known is the wanderings of Alleb from Borrd to Wechi, sometimes even to Iric. There are some reports of Alleb fashioning weapons for herself- of what kind and how doughty, none know. But Alleb is here, and her purposes unknown.”<br><br><br>Heraldry: If I may, I would like a golden cross, encircled by white flowers, on a field of blue. Thank you, great Baron! *bows*</p>

            <p>Yeah, Barony July was pretty small. Along with Makari and Thanasius, you started with just one city; everyone else had two or more. I think I was particularly mean to you - you were Rome, but without access to iron. Oops. ^<em>^&#39; (Cities, obviously, were partitioned based on what castles lie within the barony&#39;s borders; since yours doesn&#39;t actually exist, your only city was your old ruins.)<br><br>As for who everyone was, I have a list of... most of that. I selected a couple for general feel (notably, Kaitlyn as Hatty), and then selected a primary trait for each baron. Since there are eleven traits, and I started with eleven barons, I went for one each. Then I chose from the available options.<br><br>Civs were assigned based either on their unique unit (for warlike leaders) or unique buildings (for peaceful); in Civ 4, you can disconnect leader from civilisation. So my original 11 were:<br><br>Thanasius - Genghis Khan - Spain<br>VixenMage - Pericles - Native America<br>Phobos - Mehmed II - China<br>Araeph - Huayna - Ottoman<br>Cassie - Louis XIV - Carthage<br>PC - Darius I - Mali<br>Neshomeh - Lincoln - Korea<br>Kaitlyn - Hatty - Persia<br>Iximaz - Cathy - HRE<br>Huinesoron - Sitting Bull - Celts<br>Dann - Churchill - Sumeria<br><br>The funniest moments while playing were watching Neshomeh Lincoln grimace and facepalm every time someone did something ridiculous. ^</em>^<br><br>But that setup had a big problem: VixenMage and Dann were taking over the map. So I added you and Makari in to balance out the east. You were Rome and Makari was China. Makari was roleplaying as Suleiman, and you were... um...<br><br>Oh, that&#39;s right. You were Izzy. ^_^ Which explains the &#39;mad religious feuds&#39; aspect of things. Isabella is a liiiittle bit crazy about that. If I&#39;d given you iron, you might well have dominated the eastern landscape.<br><br>hS</p>

His words are &quot;Remember My Name.&quot;<br><br>History<br><br>Ser Read is a new-made knight, once a citizen-in-hiding for a year. While he arrived from Tivit, that is not his homeland. He is one of the most widely-traveled knights of Konti-Nyuum, and he has a history in such lands as the beastwoman-populated Monsume, the bleak and politically-oriented Gurrm, the treasure-filled Land of the Shuvell Nights, the Independent State of Pai-Zoh, The Empire of Blanc-Lupus, and stranger places still. <br><br>After finally achieving knighthood, Ser Read brought swift justice to a Marizu invasion of the land of Monsume, and drowned the leader of said incursion. He escaped before any of Monsume&#39;s denizens could &quot;thank&quot; him.<br><br>He returned to Monsume after learning that the land&#39;s king had been impersonated by one of the Marizu. He hunted the imposter into a secret Marizu outpost in Monsume, and burned it to the ground. Once more, Ser Read hastily fled Monsume. Exactly why he would leave a land filled with beautiful women that wished to bed him, none but the knight know.<br><br>After his second journey to Monsume, Ser Read realized that he had a gift for hunting imposters. Many Marizu that impersonated nobles of distant lands met swift justice at the knight&#39;s hand.<br><br>Despite his success, Ser Read rarely receives recognition for his accomplishments. Many times, he returns triumphant to Borrd and finds that few care. While he doesn&#39;t mind the lack of praise, he worries that he is destined to be forgotten, always eclipsed by the works of greater knights.<br><br>Personality<br><br>Ser Dylan Read is moody, eccentric, difficult to understand, and lonely. His odd ideas and strange behaviors make him unsettling to others at the best of times, and do nothing to improve his relationships with others. He desires companionship, but has yet to find anyone in Plort willing to befriend him. He has made several desperate attempts to forget his loneliness; forgetting the rest of Plort and focusing on hunting Marizu on one occasion, considering leaving the Union altogether on another. Nevertheless, he is loyal to the cause of Plort, and is willing to serve any baron who will have him.<br><br>As mentioned, Ser Read is deathly afraid of being forgotten. Many of his mad antics are done out of a desperate desire to be remembered, for good or ill. He has even considered melting down and reforging his weapons, although barons and other knights always convince him not to.<br><br>He is also known to prefer the company of animals; perhaps his fondness of the land of Monsume is related to this, despite his efforts to avoid the populace&#39;s affections. He can often be found conversing with dogs, rats, cats and other animals. It has been proven that the best way to improve his mood is to present him with kittens, puppies or similarly small and endearing animals.<br><br>Weapons<br><br>Oddly, Ser Read&#39;s weapon of choice is a shovel, which he calls Valor. It is definitely made of some exotic material, as it is lighter than any shovel has a right to be. He also carries a hand crossbow named Kalablilu. He recently acquired two other weapons: a gem-encrusted, serrated saber named Mantis and a warhammer he calls Hobb.<br><br>OOC notes<br><br>Yes, I borrowed his title and the idea of words from A Song of Ice and Fire. I&#39;ll change the title if need be.<br><br>Also, Plort!me&#39;s name is actually based on my real name. &quot;Dylan&quot; sounds similar to my first name (and people do accidentally call me Dylan a lot), and my last name does contain something you read.<br><br>Ser Read&#39;s attitudes are largely based on my own. A lot of times, I post a story, only to be very quickly buried by one written by Iximaz or SkarmorySilver or what have you. I feel like the things I write are sometimes ignored in favor of the existing PPC behemoths, and honestly, being ignored and forgotten is worse than any criticism.<br><br>As for the loneliness bit, well, that&#39;s my real-life personality bleeding through. It also isn&#39;t something that I plan on resolving, because a) I don&#39;t believe wish-fulfillment is ever a good thing, and b) I&#39;m a complete sadist to the characters I create.<br><br>Other things<br>Gurrm: George R.

            <p>I like where you&#39;re going with this! But honestly, I share the same concerns that you do, though of course I&#39;m not such an ass about them the way I used to be. So that means Skaer&#39;morys The Silver would find Ser Read... relatable, I should say. Though of course, his interests are different.<br><br>Y&#39;know what, here, have an addendum to Ser Read&#39;s history...<br><br>Not long after joining the Kingdom of Plort, the wandering shovel-wielding knight happened upon a strange and amazing spectacle. A Marizu warrior from the land of Emelpy Fim had been spotted just outside the kingdom. Ser Read, then a curious young citizen, snuck over to the battlefield to watch the fight. What he expected was for the warrior&#39;s head to be sliced off by a sword... what he got was the surprising spectacle of a warhorse with a coat and mane as colorful as the sky running down the invader, tearing her to pieces with its pounding hooves and dagger-like teeth.<br><br>Mounted upon the wild steed was a young man clad in silver scale mail and adorned with crimson feathers. Ser Read, impressed by this man&#39;s taming of a flesh-eating horse, came up to greet him (at the risk of losing one of his limbs) and ask him to share his secrets. The rider simply chuckled, and told him that once he achieved Knighthood, he would be there to lend a helping hand. With that, he spurred his steed and rode away - but not before giving him his name: Skaer&#39;morys the Silver.<br><br>When Ser Read went on his first mission after gaining Knighthood, Skaer&#39;morys was one of the first to hear of his quest to the land of Monsume. Later on, Skaer&#39;morys attracted Read&#39;s attention once again after using Falchion, Rasheeda, and his corpse-tearing raptor, Velociripper, to infiltrate the state of Desu Noto and destroy a high-ranking Marizu general by the name of Darq Y&#39;gami. Upon returning, Skaer&#39;morys would find Ser Read with a surprising request: to journey with him to F&#39;Naf and get rid of another one of the Marizu.<br><br>And that&#39;s how a friendship was born...<br><br>(Hope I got everything right! I referenced three of my missions here, including my collab with Voyd. I&#39;ll update the list of Skaer&#39;morys&#39; creatures later!)</p>

            <p>Plort was first a Protectorate. Today it is a Union - that is, a federation not dissimilar to the United States - of four different nations: The Protectorate of Borrd (an oligarchy ruled by a baronial council); the Republic of Iric (a democracy); the Commonwealth of Wechi (a direct democracy in theory; in practice, the baron does stuff until someone disagrees); and the Refuge of Ozerbord (an autocracy).</p>

            <p>Greetings and salutations to all and sundry.<br><br>The Baron Neshomeh sends her regrets and sincere apologies that she will not be able to arrive for the council in a timely manner. She has just returned from a campaign in the land of Fantopra and is weary. Also, she has received a valuable new shipment for her personal library, and seeing that it is properly housed and that all records are in order is keeping her up and about when she should be in bed. She hopes her absence will be forgiven and trusts that her fellow barons will rule wisely in all things. If her input is required, this messenger stands ready to carry the word of the council to her in Castle Arkive.<br><br>Yours,<br><br>~Neshomeh, Baron, etc. etc.<br><br>(( In other words, I&#39;ve got a bunch of coding to do, not to mention laundry and hopefully working on my co-write with Iximaz, too. I&#39;ll join in later if I have time, but there are just not enough hours in the day!<br><br>Fortunately, this is totally in keeping with Baron Neshomeh&#39;s character as a somewhat absent-minded person who is more interested in anything that smells of dust than she is in ruling. ^_^ It&#39;s a good thing the Wechians are an independent lot. ))</p>

            <p><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/HSKaitlynImpaledArms.png"><br><br><i>A proposal by Baron Huinesoron, Protector of Ozerbord.</i><br><br>It has come to my attention that we have a serious population imbalance in the Union of Plort.<br><br>The lands west of the Larninkurvs are developing well; Wechi is a flourishing nation, Ozerbord and western Borrd have received a recent influx, and the settlements along the Hyparlink Route are growing slowly.<br><br>The situation east of the mountains, though, is worrying. Baron Cassie is often absent, and her deputy, Sir Ekyl, is rarely seen. Though Godreve and Tumblar are doing well, they stand alone in their barony, surrounded by little more than cattle ranches.<br><br>In western Iric, matters are even more grim: the most recent survey suggested that no more than a few hundred people live <i>anywhere</i> in Iric west of the river Sozeri. While I am sure La Wunj is as thronged as ever, and its trade with Autor and Somath-Aful is no doubt fruitful for the Republic, the fact remains that vast swathes of prime land are left fallow.<br><br>At the same time, the lands west of the Larninkurvs are unable to feed our knights. Much of the food produced in the fertile Gu-Gel basin is being shipped north, and while the profit is certainly desirable, it is having a negative impact on our military operations. Some of our knights have been forced to found petty kingdoms in Weab&#39;s northern wastes, simply to feed their soldiers on campaign.<br><br>There is a solution to this dilemma. It is somewhat drastic - nay, say rather &#39;dramatic&#39; - but I feel it is the best option available to us:<br><br>I propose the creation of a <b>fifth nation of the Union of Plort</b>, to be ruled directly by this Baronial Council. It would encompass all of Borrd east of the mountains, and Iric west of the Kar&#39;eer forest and the Sozeri (with precise borders to be determined). It would be a nation for our soldiers: a breadbasket for the Union of Plort, shipping food by way of Wechi to the battlegrounds of the Marizu League. The current baronial borders, needless to say, will not be altered at this time.<br><br>This new realm will be a return to the first days of Konti-Nyuum, when the Protectorate of Plort devoted all its energies to the war against the Marizu, and it should bear a name to match. The legendary Sittori people were the first to colonise northern Weab, long before the foundation of Fanvik-Neht, and our new nation should bear their name: <b>the Riding of Sittorese.</b><br><br>Huinesoron, by the grace of Kanun Baron and Knight of Plort, Protector of Ozerbord, Custodian of Fanvik-Whirl, Marshal of the Order of Udisc, Scourge of the Marizu, Friend of Medellurth, &amp;c &amp;c &amp;c<br><br>[Or &#39;writing of stories&#39;, if you prefer. I don&#39;t know whether to class this as correcting an omission, or recognising a new trend, but it&#39;s definitely true that a lot of people have recently been interacting with each other by cowriting missions, and by betaing each other&#39;s work. I think it&#39;s a big enough phenomenon to count alongside the Board, Wiki, Chat, and Other Board/RPs as a nation of Plort.<br><br>As to why I chose this location: well, partly for the in-universe reasons I listed. But mostly because the two towns in the area - Godreve [Google Drive] and Tumblar - are both named for places where people host missions. It is, I think, an appropriate setting for a military nation.]</p>

            <p>I can understand that the founding of a nation is more interesting than constructing barracks, armories and roads. But I am of the opinion that this should be brought to an end now, so that the Council can turn its attention to the urgent problem of burnt-down OFUM (and the upcoming celebration of the victory over the ypurs, and Critta-Kalthin’s promotion to City status).<br><br>So, firstly I present to the council this <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=277345;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">missive</a>, signed by every and all known residents of the Commonwealth  of Wechi (who bothered to respond to my request), for the barons consideration.<br><br>Secondly, I suggest that the prospective Riders of Sittorese be given time to assemble at a place they deem suitable, to discuss their internal affairs, and that they shall in due time report their decisions concerning the government of the Riding of Sittorese to the next Baronial Council, or to the councils interim keeper of the minutes of important events.<br><br>Thirdly, my personal opinion is that the ancient tradition of &quot;Listen to your Beytahs, but don’t do everything they say without thinking it through yourself&quot; should be the only law applicable in The Riding of Sittorees, but since I am a resident of Wechi, I can not speak for the Riders, and thus I will say no more. (I certainly don’t intend to start a bloody civil war over The Riding of Sittorees.)<br><br>HG, by common non-objection the Commonwealth of Wechi’s delegate at the Baronial Council of the Union of Plort.<br><br><br>((My short holidays are over, thus I may not longer be able to represent the Commonwealth of Wechi here.<br><br>In case prospective Riders of Sittorese actually want to vote about their government, these were the suggestions so far:<br><br>Direct rule by the Baronial Council (<a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=277038;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">original proposal</a>).<br><br>Let Phobos take over (<a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=277072;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">proposed by Phobos</a>).<br><br>A Conclave of Beytah (<a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=277086;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">copyright by hS</a>; since hS cannot suggest it in-character, HG half-heartedly adopted it).<br><br>A small legislative assembly whose members are appointed by the barons (<a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=277111;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">suggested by PC</a>).<br><br>Abovementioned assembly being chosen from valiant knights, knights famous for their co-operative riding, and practitioners of Beytah (<a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=277208;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">hS’s response to Sir Ekyl</a>).<br><br>A three-chamber-assembly (<a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=277219;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">HG’s attempt to make this too complicated to work</a>).<br><br>A Knights&#39; Congress, a Cooperative Communion, and a Conclave of Beytah, mimicking the executive, legislative and judicative powers of a balanced democracy (<a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=277241;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">hS’s attempt to make it work anyway</a>).<br><br>An anarchy, where &quot;Listen to your Beytahs, or don’t&quot; is the only law (<a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=277267;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">HG’s preference</a>).<br><br>Let it be that a series of tests shall be devised according to the qualities desired of the Riding&#39;s rulers, and whosoever passes them with flying colours shall rule the new country. law (<a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=277424;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">Thanasius private(?) correspondence</a>). <br><br>Since nobody (except hS in his response to HG) mentioned elections to let the Riders at least choose their leaders, if they are not allowed to choose their form of government, Wechi’s opposition appears to be justified, and I wonder why no word was heard from Iric.     <br><br>I assume that not wanting to vote demonstrates a preference for anarchy. It certainly doesn’t mean that, by common non-objection, the barons are allowed to do whatever they want to do.<br><br>HG))</p>

            <p>((AKA &#39;what I will put in the Cyclopaedia unless someone has an objection))<br><br>-That the Riding of Sittorese be created. ((This seems pretty uncontroversial at this point.))<br><br>-That the borders of the Riding be appointed as such:<br><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/Sittorese.png"><br><br>((That leaves all three western baronial seats still in their current nations. It also means the Riding doesn&#39;t extend into Barony VixenMage.

((That doesn&#39;t even need saying; it&#39;s the purpose of the baronial system.))<br><br>-That the production and distribution of sufficient grain for the knights of Plort be considered a military matter, without the same applying to other grain grown. ((New concept, but should be uncontroversial? Basically the Riding isn&#39;t allowed to self-govern itself out of achieving its designated task.))<br><br>-That in the absence of Baron Cassie, Sir Ekyl of Godreve be empowered to act in her stead. ((As he already does.))<br><br>-That in the event of the barons failing to fulfil their duties, the Baronial Council may step in at need. ((Again, part of the job description.))<br><br>-That the Riders of Sittorese be permitted to select their own form of governance; and that if they do not form a working system by the time the Baronial Council next convenes, the Council may at its discretion intervene. ((Ie, in real terms, &#39;let&#39;s just not say for now and anyone saying they live there next time can choose&#39;. Given that we&#39;re not gonna get a consensus out of this thread, this seems pretty logical. Also basically in agreement with Hieronymus here.))<br><br>-That all flags, anthems, and unassigned place-names be designated by the Riders, at the next Baronial Council.

            <p>Seeing that Milady Neshomeh is still absent, and no knight of Wechi spoke up yet, allow me to address the Baronial Council and the knights and commoners of Plort, hoping that what I say is in the best interest of all people of Wechi.<br><br>The people of Wechi believe that Critta-Kalthin is important, and support the suggestion to promote this town to the status of a city.<br><br>If our armies are no longer starving, and we increase the efforts in fighting the dreaded Marizu, this will draw attention, and certainly cause an influx of immigrants, which means more soldiers for our armies and need for more supplies. Thus, I can not see how growing more grain in the Riding of Sittorese would affect the economy of Critta-Kalthin and cause the down-cycle Lady Iximaz and her entourage apparently fear.<br><br>Concerning the proposed government of our new nation, I have to object to Baron Huinesoron as well as to Baron PC. Both confuse the concepts of civil and military reign. I agree with the Poor-Cynick that the Baronial Council should not even try to delve into the tidbits of governing a nation far away from their residences. But the barons also have no business in appointing the legislative assembly of a nation. And why would the return of barons whose absence inspired the founding of this new nation lead to dissolving the assembly, unless you intend to dissolve the nation itself, and make it a part of Borrd again?<br><br>The people of Wechi are used to rule themselves, although I have to admit that following the suggestions of our elders demonstrably helps keeping things neatly in order. If it is even true that eastern Borrd and western Iric fell to waste because the people there are unable to rule themselves, and any sort of government has to be established, we should remember the Sittori people’s tradition of listening to the practitioners of Beytah. In my opinion, the Conclave of Beytah to govern the Riding of Sittorese could be fairly self-organizing, because the people know best who helped them most, and unskilled apprentices would not even think of ruling this nation; they know quite well that they would just be laughed out of Plort.<br><br>What? What are you mumbling there, in your private conversation with Sir Ekyl, while I am holding this carefully prepared speech? A three-chamber-assembly? Valiant knights, co-operators and practitioners of Beytah? I have to think about that.<br><br>((Can we come up with names for the other two chambers?

            <p>It appears that you propose a direct election, along the lines of the election of our own barons [[and the Ops and Dars of Iric, but Baron Me makes a point of never mentioning that country unless he can&#39;t avoid it]]. This would be... acceptable, provided the Assembly remained committed to the cause against the Marizu.<br><br>In times past we have heard of nations with a threefold division in their governance: between executive, judicial, and legislative. Do you propose that this model be followed by the Assembly of the Riding? [[I think that would be fascinating, but I&#39;ve no idea whether it would work.]] If it were so, the Conclave of Beytah must hold the judicial power, for their arts of healing make them the clear best choice. The... Knights&#39; Congress should bear the executive right, for our knights are decisive in their battles. Then would the... Cooperative Communion [[oh stars this is hard]] be the legislators, working together as they ever do to formulate the laws of the land.<br><br>~Huinesoron, Baron of Plort</p>

            <p>I didn’t say anything about elections. But I would like to hear the Riders’ opinions on electing a Knight’s Congress, a Cooperative Communion and a Conclave of Beytah. After all, I don’t have to live with this government, but they do. Or may be we can all agree that &quot;Listen to your Beytahs, unless you believe that they are stupid&quot; is the only law that should apply in the Riding of Sittorese, and Sir Ekyl can just pretend that everybody who demands something he does not like is stupid anyway?<br><br>((This <b>is</b> fascinating. But Hieronymus is an anarchist who lives in Wechi because in theory nobody rules there, and the prospect of beytahing commoners getting power is probably not so intriguing that he personally wood settle in Riding of Sittorese and claim a seat in this conclave.<br><br>His conviction that mature people can sort out anything that needs to be sorted out without any kind of government is of course naive. Hermits just don’t usually deal with hordes of people who cannot even agree to disagree. But being who he is, if Hieronymus has too much say in the creation of this government, he will try to make it so complex that in practice nobody bothers to do anything about it and the Riders just listen to their Beytahs without many formalities anyway.<br><br>So speak up, Riders.

            <p>Indeed, I have seen thee fight when I have envied thy behaviour. However, let it be known such, and I apologise to disrupt this council with my bluntness: I will not stand for any attempt to arbitrarily strip Baron Cassie and myself of our lands, especially not for the sake of enriching another who resides so distantly he has scarcely ever seen Ngort and Godreve himself, nor the ranches and farming villages that dot the countryside. I stand with Baron Huinesoron against your proposal and anything of the like, but also against both of you in splitting us away from Borrd and putting us under the governance of another. Surely we would be happy to use our crops to feed the Union, and to allow our lands be used as a staging area for armies riding against the Marizu, but the land east of the Larninkurvs was hard earned, and I would sooner marry a Marizu chieftess than stand for such mockery.<br><br>((Sir Ekyl is, of course, aware he is speaking somewhat out of turn, and belatedly, but as someone who has title in these lands and was referred to as the baron&#39;s deputy, he&#39;s not going to stand for not having a voice in the discussion. :P))</p>

            <p>The Council of Borrd holds little sway east of the Larninkurvs; you yourself have oft complained of bandits in the hinterlands of Godreve, and the barons of Borrd have done nothing, for we are locked behind nigh-impassable mountains. But were the Riding of Sittorese to be established according to the Poor Cynick&#39;s plan, rule would be in the hands of those local inhabitants who have shown themselves willing to step forward and take up the burden.<br><br>Your holdings at Godreve are known as a place where knights from far and wide may gather and tell their tales; in the Riding, might it not become an even greater settlement, even a city in its own right - perhaps even, if we may dare to breathe of it, a <i>capital</i> city?<br><br>Huinesoron, Baron of Plort<br><br>((Who is not above what approached outright bribery.

            <p>My soldiers have delighted in the practise, hunting such mongrels down. It keeps them fresh and ready for campaign, during the down times.<br><br>Now, as for your proposal, I would be fool to suggest you speak no sense. The people here would be better off, in likelihood. However, were Godreve capital as you say, I would not be made to bow before some assembly whose members I had no right to choose, in my own seat. The Union has always repudiated the idea of kingship, and I make no attempt to change that course, but I see no reason not to condition my assent on the promise - and delivery - of rulership, wholly or as partner. As a part of the Union, I would wish to be held in equal standing with the rulers of Iric, or Wechi, or Ozerborrd, for if I am a mere subject in my own capital, then this is little more than a swindle.<br><br>((No real effect out of universe, but he&#39;s an ambitious fellow, and why shouldn&#39;t he ensure he isn&#39;t being scammed? :P I agree Google Drive would make most sense as capital, though he also wouldn&#39;t agree to give up power in his own land, so wanting a guarantee of being in charge - either as sovereign, co-ruler with somebody, or head of any assembly formed - seemed reasonable! And, of course, why be given a nation if you will still be treated as lower than the others? ;) ))   </p>

            <p>Surely, they would be chosen from among the most prominent citizens of the new realm. Three traits, methinks, should stand preeminent among them. First, those knights who serve most valiantly in the wars against the Marizu, demonstrating their strength of arms and spirit.

            <p>Six, give me strength...<br><br>To be quite frank, the idea of land being purely owned by anyone is absurd to me, but we shall deal with my lack of understanding of your form of government another day. However, if I cannot understand how a man can call himself baron and claim what he wishes, I certainly do not see how one can claim what was settled by others, and force them out. You use honeyed words and appeals to politics, when all I see is dirty tactics not unlike the Marizu! Squatting in others land, hoisting your flag and claiming it your own. <br><br>Now, as for the matter of the baronial council claiming the land... It is no secret, I have criticized many of you, some publicly, some in private correspondence. I see how many measure their worth in census numbers and acreage in their hold, and I call it to their attention. However, in this instance, I am in full support of a Baron-led military state. Much as I may not understand how it all works, I can see that it does (somewhat). It would help to answer the problem we face with the loss of Ofum, by providing additional barracks and training grounds for knights and civilians. True, it would not be on Weab, and a suitable replacement will need to be found, but it is a step in the right direction. And, while many barons are greedy power hungry-*ooft!* Erm, as a gathered council, you seem to work in the (general direction of) common good. As long as we knights have a say in how things are run in this new nation, such as we do now, I see no harm, and indeed potential benefit from this new state.<br><br>((What he is actually expecting is that the barons, faced with having to actually work together over the pettier details of running a nation rather then the grand aspects, will tear each other apart. Most likely literally. This will force them to either work together (Friendship is Magic, after all!) or crumble into war, which would allow for a less corrupt system to take its place. A long-term win-win for Jumper.))</p>

            <p>Does my forthright manner not speak to my sincere belief that this situation would quickly be resolved under my stewardship?  Were I the villain you all seem to believe I am, I would simply move in and claim those lands.  And who could say otherwise, if I did?  That I make my requests in the light of day, at an open forum, and subject myself to the consensus of my fellow Barons, and the noble Knights of Plort, should be ample evidence that I am not the scoundrel you think me to be.</p>

            <p>Your &#39;forthright manner&#39; does you credit; but I have learned in my studies and in my travels that scoundrels are cannot always be identified by military actions. Indeed, some of the most foul of scoundrels are those who speak boldly while planning to achieve their dastardly goals by any means, should talk fail.<br><br>I say this, of course, not to imply that you are such a scoundrel as this; however, Baron Phobos, I say that a close eye must be kept on your actions following the close of this meeting of the Council. If your actions are pure, and do not contradict the consensus of this Council, whatever it may be, <i>then</i>, milord, will we have our true evidence. And should they be impure--should you attempt to claim these lands even if the Council does not rule in your favor--then there will be those who are well-placed to prevent the injustice.<br><br>--<br>((I&#39;d been wondering if it would turn out that Esh has a mind for politics but often little interest.

            <p>She seems to have interpreted &#39;Critta-Kalthin ships much of its grain north, so a new realm should be established in eastern Konti-Nyuum to feed our own knights&#39; as &#39;we should take the grain trade away from Critta-Kalthin and place it in my hands&#39;. I am at a loss to see how either of these would be the result of my proposal: the Riding of Sittorese would not sell its produce to foreign powers, and so would not compete with Critta-Kalthin at all; nor would the Riding be in any way associated with myself or my domains.<br><br>Frankly, while I am in full support of the principle of openness at the Baronial Council, I sometimes wish we might make exceptions.<br><br>~Baron Huinesoron, not of eastern Konti-Nyuum<br><br>((Because he&#39;s obnoxious when riled up, stars yes.

            <p>In the name of Kanun, the Guider, and Spelin, the One who Dictate.<br><br>I had remembered when the first time I formed my ten fingers in humbleness before Baron Huinesoron, and are accorded lands for my people, both Orcs and Men. But my memory is a bit rusty, and may people correct me should I recounted wrong.<br><br>Critta&#39; was built close to a delta, of which its soil was mostly black clay, which were suitable for rice-growing. We were ignorant of the matters of wheat-growing, and the people I sent to study the technique suggested to me that the soil may not be very suitable for wheat, and forays into the business may not have generated enough food to sustain our growing numbers.<br><br>After the people of Kalthin accepted me as their officer and representative, and united the two towns to form Critta&#39;-Kalthin, we could not find anyone who were willing to oversee wheat production. We decided it was a small matter, and everyone in the town seemed happy to eat rice daily.<br><br>We also could not find any towns in Konti-Nyuum that ate enough rice to justify trade with them, so we decided to sell our rice to Are-Pea Alliance and sometimes Guggle.<br><br>Such was our situation.<br><br>As of now, we may need to spend  a bit more money and labour before we could plant wheat, should the profit opportunity arise. But we are ready to fulfill market demands, and we do consider past kindness and local requirements in setting our prices.<br><br>Despite having winters, our summers and and autumns happen long enough to allow planting of short-season rice variaties. But we can&#39;t plant rice for half of the year, and we are on a tight schedule. I would propose that other Baronies, should they find it prudent, to allow anyone wishing for better wages to work at Critta&#39;-Kalthin in order to plant wheat to fulfill the demands of Konti-Nyuum. We will pay the workers well, and they will not pay any goods taxes to Critta&#39;-Kalthin, of course only if Lady Iximaz allows such exemption.<br><br>I, who is sincere,<br><br>Dark Civilian Aakmal.<br><br>[I am basing rice-planting on Japan, as they are the northenmost that I know that plants rice.

            <p>For I sees through thy pretty words. Milady Iximaz&#39;s wars upon the hated scourge o&#39; the sea that is the Marizu, it do depend upon the sea an&#39; her tradin&#39; ships. I knows this, milord, for I do have to read the Barony&#39;s books when I do balance &#39;em. The grain traders of Critta-Kalthin buy up their wares from all across our noble nation, milord Baron - an&#39; if this Ridin&#39; will not sell to traders who wish to send our grain abroad, then that&#39;s less duties for milady&#39;s war chest. Instead, thy old army gets fed, for &#39;tis thee as has most to gain from the arrangement. Thyself, with thy raggedy armies, trapped as th&#39;art beneath the grindstone o&#39; poverty, aye, thou wouldst be in a fine position to go a-raidin&#39; once more. My mistress? Her star wanes with that, for she can gain less from her privateerin&#39; with no spare coin for ship repairs an&#39; such. Milady wanes as milord waxes, an&#39; the old order o&#39; things do endure like maggots in a midden. You hurt her, my Lord, you do her most grievous hurt if you do this - and since she&#39;s ten times the raider you ever was, old gamekeeper, you hurt your war. <i>Our</i> war.<br><br>Though that be just my own readin&#39; o&#39; your letters&#39; shape, milord. I be but simple country folk, an&#39; not well-versed in thy most courtly turns of phrase.<br><br>---<br><br>Yeah, that&#39;s not a bad idea. City rights are extremely important, and port town sounds a lot more... well, parochial&#39;s the best word I can come up with... than port city.<br><br>Also, I&#39;m trying not to have my charrie argue too vociferously against this course of action, because it&#39;s obvious Baron You wants to push it through and there is such a thing as needless expense of political capital, but such actions really would hurt Barony Iximaz a hell of a lot more than I think Baron You realises. Wars are expensive, after all, and you can&#39;t eat glorious victory. =]</p>

            <p>You appear to have Baron Huinesoron&#39;s proposal confused for something of a more... sinister nature. He proposed that the new nation would be a &quot;breadbasket&quot;, which sounds to me as though he intends for this to be a new place of production.<br><br>To this, I say, I wholeheartedly agree. Increasing the grain production of Plort would highly benefit our soldiers, and I am in full support of anything to increase our efficiency in the war against the Marizu.<br><br>There is one thing that concerns me, however. Huinesoron, you say that the new nation, were it to be founded, would be ruled by the Baronial Council, but someone would need to be put in charge of this nation, lest we want it to collapse as quickly as it is founded. I doubt any of us have the time or energies to devote to watching over the land, especially since we all have our own baronies to run. Who, then, would have the task of overseeing the day-to-day necessities of ruling a nation?<br><br>But I digress. There is one thing I would like to bring up, and that would be to give Critta-Kalthin status as a city. It has grown rapidly over the past year, and it now a city in all but name. It is only proper that it be given the same rights as such.<br><br><br>((<s>No, she totally didn&#39;t show up dressed in her raiding gear, why on earth would she do that that would be silly</s> <br><br>Am I taking advantage of hS&#39; explanation to make myself look better?

            <p>((Basically, the present plan consists of earmarking a vast amount of grain - that would otherwise be traded through Critta-Kalthin and bring in some much-needed funds - solely for domestic use, rather than splitting it in any way. This glut of grain drives prices down, even if it is just for use in Plort itself, and that means less trade overall for Critta-Kalthin. This in turn means less excise duties for Barony Iximaz to spend on its many, many, <i>many</i> raids, because that stuff costs money. Ship repairs. Equipment. Logistical support. Paying her troops. The list goes on. She&#39;d have to inflict artificial price controls upon the grain trade to even have a <i>hope</i> of breaking even afterwards, and that means less raiding because she can&#39;t afford it, which means her income dwindles further. It&#39;s a vicious circle.))<br><br>((As for why the Scape-Grace is suggesting you don&#39;t go raiding any more, well, that&#39;s a lack of clarity on my part. You simply don&#39;t go raiding anywhere near as much as she does - plus, she doesn&#39;t like being called stupid. In fact, I&#39;d go so far as to say she really damned despises it. So she&#39;s insulting him, to his face, and yeah that may actually have been a really dumb idea. =] ))</p>

Without Ofum, we have no training facility for our knights; no barracks for our soldiers; no armoury for our weapons.<br><br>But while some of the armies have undertaken to rebuild portions of Ofum, the damage is simply too great - and besides, having all our military in one place is a recipe for disaster. New developments on the southern coast have also reduced the importance of the Borrd Gap in the war on the Marizu. I therefore propose the following:<br><br>A military centre to be established in southern Wechi, in the curve of the Turaipod Heights, and named Los Taelis. Roads to be constructed linking Los Taelis to Mei&#39;n Payj and to the castle Arkive. The harbour at Mei&#39;n Payj to be expanded, and to assume part of the duties of sending forth our brave knights.<br><br>A second military centre to be established in southern Ozerbord, and named Ba-Korp. A road constructed if necessary to tie Ba-Korp into the road network. The skyship port of Skypcht to be expanded and its production increased, to allow knights to <b>fly</b> to Weab to take up arms against the Marizu. The precise location of Ba-Korp will need to be determined; whether it should lie within Barony Huinesoron or Barony Thanasius Ampelius.<br><br>With these two new camps, the knowledge and skills we have learned at Ofum can be preserved, and the war against the Marizu continued.<br><br>Huinesoron, by the grace of Kanun Baron and Knight of Plort, Protector of Ozerbord, Custodian of Fanvik-Whirl, Marshal of the Order of Udisc, Scourge of the Marizu, Friend of Medellurth, &amp;c &amp;c &amp;c<br><br>[This is because of the unexpected deletion of Miss Cam&#39;s website. The PPC backups are mostly in two locations: Neshomeh&#39;s Tripod &#39;Lost Tales&#39;, and my Webs/Google backups. The former is sited in a fairly self-explanatory location; the latter could very well be moved to the Borrd portions of Barony hS (ie, around the Wep and Gu-Gel rivers), but it seemed better thematically to put it close to the skyship port; the whole of Ozerbord vaguely represents my stuff anyway. ^_^<br><br>To clarify: the fort of Ofum <b>has</b> burned. You can&#39;t debate that; and unless Miss Cam restores her website, it&#39;s not being rebuilt, either. The debate is over what we do about it.]</p>

            <p>I couldn&#39;t help but snort at the horrible medicine in that Phantom of the Opera fic.<br><br>Getting shot in the chest is survivable even without medical care, but only if you&#39;re very lucky. Let&#39;s say your Sue was shot with a low-velocity bullet (considering the era, this could happen) that hit at an angle, bounced off her ribs, and got stuck somewhere not too vital, say maybe between the muscle and the bone. It could happen. But such a comparatively minor injury would have our Sue fainting mostly from the surprise of being shot (that&#39;s the only explanation for her instant loss of consciousness; anything but a shot to the heart or a major artery would have left her conscious for thirty seconds or more). The second the Phantom started stupidly probing around in the wound to try to find the bullet, she would wake from her faint and start screaming bloody murder. Without proper antiseptic technique, the injury would get infected. Back then, even comparatively minor surgery like this had a low success rate. Our Sue would have been likely to die of infection even if she had gotten a survivably minor chest wound.<br><br>Her second set of symptoms is an easy diagnosis, but I seriously doubt the writer knew what they were describing. Feeling cold, faint, and weak, with a relatively sudden onset, is what happens when you have low blood sugar. She should also have been sweating and sick to her stomach, but one assumes that those aren&#39;t glamorous enough symptoms. In any case, the treatment that the Phantom administers is utterly stupid. There&#39;s no need to give any kind of vaguely described injection. Someone with low blood sugar can be treated in the short term by giving them something sugary to drink; if you go to the ER with low blood sugar, they give you orange juice. You could give them a glucose IV, I suppose, but that&#39;s a bigger volume than you could get into a single syringe. In the long term of course they figure out why your blood sugar was so low to begin with.<br><br>Both incidents show a total lack of respect for medicine and a total lack of research... But it&#39;s a suefic. I should&#39;ve expected that.</p>

            <p>I quite liked all three of these stories. First off, Gall and Derick. Both the interlude and the following mission have rapidly made them one of my favorite agent pairs. They have a very good banter already down. I also liked the information gap: with Gall as the headstrong newbie and Derick as her exasperated teacher, it allows for a convenient way to explain different canonical aspects without seeming too forced. The summation of <i>Phantom</i>&#39;s plot was a good example.<br><br>I really dug the end of the mission, where the canon gets into the heads of the agents. That was a nice touch and made the climax suitably climactic. I also liked that killing the Sue pretty much undid the damage. The only complaints I had were in regard to a couple of lines, like &quot;Gall summed it up in her usual succinct manner.&quot; That one in particular felt a little too on the nose. Otherwise, it was very good.<br><br>I also enjoyed the &quot;Catastrophe Theory&quot; story, although I believe that I said as much when I betaed it. It was interesting seeing some of the steps that led the PPC to such a dark path. I enjoy that kind of piecemeal world-building, particularly for post-apocalyptic-esque settings (which I would argue that version of the PPC kinda is).<br><br>Good stuff all around. I look forward to future stories.<br><br>PC</p>

            <p>Rubbing her eyes, Agent Penny (DMS, Guild Assassin, OFUDisc graduate-of-sorts) shoved open the door to her response centre. It hadn&#39;t been as hard to find as usual, she reflected. <i>Maybe I&#39;m getting used to this place again at l-</i><br><br>A large, black, spike-covered creature was crouched in the middle of the floor, seemingly playing with some small object. Penny stopped dead in the doorway, and the beast tilted its head quizzically, blinking its slit-pupilled eyes.<br><br>&quot;Why... is there a dragon in my RC?&quot;<br><br>&lt;&lt;Ah, Penny...&gt;&gt;<br><br>A swirl of pinkish light appeared, accompanying the voice that felt more like an ancestral memory. Penny grimaced.<br><br>&quot;Vemi, you remember that I&#39;m over you now, right? I&#39;ve got a... well, anyway, you don&#39;t have to keep following me around.&quot;<br><br>&lt;&lt;Firstly, I have no idea what you&#39;re on about.&gt;&gt; Fëamintë&#39;s light shimmered in what might almost have been a silent laugh. &lt;&lt;And secondly, I wasn&#39;t following you. I was halfway across Eä checking up on a pet project of mine.&gt;&gt;<br><br>&quot;What, and then suddenly you were in my response centre?&quot; Penny paused, then glowered at the dragon. &quot;Is <i>that</i> yours, then?&quot;<br><br>The dragon made a soft rumbling noise - the sort that might imply its patience was wearing thin. Fëamintë wavered slightly in the air.<br><br>&lt;&lt;Because I&#39;d play with one of Melkor&#39;s servants, wouldn&#39;t I? Don&#39;t answer that.&gt;&gt; The Maia hesitated a moment. &lt;&lt;No, I&#39;m here because you-&gt;&gt;<br><br>&quot;Well <i>someone</i> must have put it here,&quot; Penny grumbled. &quot;Dragons don&#39;t just <i>turn up</i>, you know.&quot;<br><br>&lt;&lt;I&#39;m sure, but if you keep annoying it, you&#39;ll-&gt;&gt;<br><br>&quot;I suppose I should call the mini adoption centre? Or maybe an OFU; where do you think it&#39;s from?&quot;<br><br>The dragon now looked extremely affronted. It rose up onto its front legs, peering down at Penny as if at a particularly irritating bug. Penny ignored it.<br><br>&quot;I don&#39;t suppose it matters really, they can sort it out. I&#39;ll talk to the Administrator, he can-&quot;<br><br>&lt;&lt;PENNY!&gt;&gt;<br><br>Penny blinked at her former partner. &quot;You don&#39;t have to shout. What?&quot;<br><br>&lt;&lt;Look at the door.&gt;&gt;<br><br>Penny leant back and frowned at the numberplate. &quot;1100. What about it?&quot;<br><br>Incorporeal Maiar can&#39;t sigh, so what Penny heard from Fëamintë couldn&#39;t have been one. &lt;&lt;Look again.&gt;&gt;<br><br>&quot;11...<b>1</b>0?&quot;<br><br>&lt;&lt;Yes.&gt;&gt;<br><br>&quot;Ah.&quot; Penny looked back at the severely ticked off dragon. &quot;I should probably start running at this point, yes?&quot;<br><br>&lt;&lt;Probably.&gt;&gt;<br><br><hr>
<br><br>Because if I can make that mistake on first reading, I&#39;m sure Penny can too. ^_^<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Dratted tetrapods, always catching me out... can you just pretend I&#39;ve made those edits? ^<em>^<br><br>The stories, in the order I read them:<br><br>-<b>Catastrophe Theory: Whatever Whatever</b> was particularly interesting to me, given that Cap&#39;n Dandy is my creation and I&#39;m the one who&#39;s most used him! He doesn&#39;t come across the same way I&#39;ve always written him, but that&#39;s okay - public persona versus private diary, etc. It was a fun look into his blossom, and I liked the framing story as well.<br><br>-<b>The Morning After Is I Think The Title</b> was... well, it was a good story. My main issue is that Derik first appeared in the PPC riiiight about when I dropped out of action for a few years, so neither of the characters are people I&#39;m particularly invested in. But as a story in its own right, it was good.<br><br>-<b>The Mission Had A Title, I&#39;m Sure</b> was fun, but also not so fun. ^</em>^ I loved Derik&#39;s reactions to the Phantomyness, including (of course) the finale. But... at times it felt a bit too MST-y. There were definitely sections in there where I felt I was reading this:<br><br><i>&#39;Badfic badfic badfic&#39;<br><br>Agents shout at badfic!<br><br>&#39;Badfic badfic badfic&#39;<br><br>Agents shout at badfic!</i><br><br>And yes, I know, that&#39;s what a PPC mission is all about... I&#39;unno. I won&#39;t say &#39;I&#39;ve never been a fan of&#39;, because it&#39;s a lie, but at the moment I&#39;m not a fan of agents shouting at the badfic what&#39;s wrong with it. Shouting at each other, yes. Explaining what&#39;s wrong with aggressive logic, yes. But not shouting.<br><br>It&#39;s possible I&#39;ve spent too much time around noisy children recently. <i>If you do not make Erik in character I will not be your best friend any more!</i><br><br>Overall: I enjoyed them (and please don&#39;t read the above as saying I didn&#39;t!). And the... D&#39;Erik sequence was very, very good. I think it was worth the extra month!<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Yeah, there were a few sections of the mission where I stuck in some comments and left it at that &#39;cuz I wanted to show the quote but wasn&#39;t quite sure how to expound on the nonsense, and the author&#39;s note was outright MST&#39;d. I hoped there were enough sections of actual stuff happening to balance those out, which I take to be the case since you enjoyed it generally. And yay, very glad to hear the hard work paid off for the ending. ^_^<br><br>BTW, you made me start working on a recolored version of a Monstrous Nightmare to go on Gall&#39;s wiki page. I do not have time for this, but now that I&#39;ve started I&#39;ll have to finish. I hope you&#39;re happy. {; P<br><br>~Neshomeh </p>

            <p>There was only one thing I felt was missing from proceedings. See, quite a few of the videos linked had ads on them? So I thought it might have been an amusing throwaway gag to have the Sue and the Phantom try to sell each other, say, cheap laptops or car insurance for thirty seconds before one of the musical numbers. =]</p>

I also read my webcomics with ads.<br><br>I DON&#39;T turn it off places like, say, here, where the ads interfere with the content and may even be harmful, because that&#39;s bad business.

I also don&#39;t turn it off for any random person who puts someone else&#39;s music on YouTube, because why should they profit off that? I&#39;ve paid to see PotO on stage twice and bought other merchandise, and if I like someone&#39;s music, I&#39;ll buy their CD; that&#39;s how I support the actual artists.

            <p>A wild Lily has appeared! What&#39;s this? There&#39;s Middle-earth things in the air!<br><br>First and foremost my absence can be attributed to me being overworked at school, plus getting thrown head-first into the Hobbit side of Tolkien fandom (and very solidly thumping onto the deck of the Good Ship Bagginshield. Please don&#39;t ask. There are acorns in my eyes). But I&#39;ve returned! However temporarily! And I may wander off again but before I do have some links!<br><br>-deep breath-<br><br>I&#39;m currently (in cahoots with another writer in the Hobbit fandom) working on a blog of the Quest for Erebor in real time. Yes. Daily updates from Bilbo Baggins and Thorin Oakenshield about what they&#39;re doing. No idea how everything else in Middle-earth exists as-is with the exception of the sudden presence of blogs and the internet, but I reckon they just kinda scream into the void or write in enchanted diaries or something. Bear with me. <br><br>I&#39;m plugging it here because 1) who doesn&#39;t want an in-depth and detailed look at Middle-earth during the time of the Quest for Erebor? 2) because DawnFire thought it&#39;d be fun and 3) there are TOS jokes and cameos of some of the Eldar characters I&#39;ve made up. <br><br>You can read Bilbo&#39;s blog <a href="http://quiterespectablyyours.tumblr.com/quest">here</a>, and Thorin&#39;s <a href="http://exileddurin.tumblr.com/the%20quest/chrono">here</a>.<br><br>And secondly, I&#39;m also here to rec a potential Legendary Goodfic, if you haven&#39;t already heard of it. It&#39;s called <a href="http://archiveofourown.org/works/855528/chapters/1637607">Sansûkh</a>, rated T, and the premise of the fic in four words is Dead Dwarf Peanut Gallery. <br>Basically, Thorin wakes up after the Battle of Five Armies in the halls of his Maker, where his ancestors and family and all the other dead Dwarves have been watching him with his own quest, and he gains the ability to communicate subconsciously with the world of the living. Cue Thorin ghost-stalking the events of Lord of the Rings. There is Legolas/Gimli and Thorin/Bilbo, but it&#39;s all extremely slowly developed and canon-compliant. Very. Very canon compliant. Because the author has found a way of weaving her narrative, the film&#39;s narrative, and the book all together in one cohesive whole. And the extra worldbuilding for the Dwarves is amazing. <br>I really hope someone else will second my nomination to give this amazing fic the status of Legendary Goodfic.<br><br>So other than that, what have the rest of you been up to?</p>

            <p>Nope, didn&#39;t get it at all. I do remember the stigma around those- I still haven&#39;t played Pokemon. I know it&#39;s fine, though, and once I actually remember to do so I&#39;m going to pick myself up a copy. Any suggestions on which game to start with?<br><br>*takes deep breath* CHRIIIISTIAAAAAANITYYYYY!! <br><br>I am indeed very vocal about my faith. *grins* <br><br>It&#39;s interesting, though, with <i>Harry Potter</i>, because Harry is <i>definitely</i> a Christ figure, not to mention the books are almost totally clean in all respects. I think the general rumor was that JK actually visited &quot;modern&quot; witches and incorporated those spells into her books- clearly that&#39;s not so, but I believe that&#39;s what people thought. Anyway, I&#39;ve read them, and enjoyed them immensely. <br></p>

            <p>Pokémon&#39;s sort of my area of expertise.<br>I&#39;d recommend starting with the latest games - hopefully they&#39;ll announce a 3rd version of X/Y at E3. Pokémon&#39;s been evolving slowly towards its ultimate form, and if you start with the old games, you might get turned off by the horribly outdated interfaces.<br>And I think the issue with Pokémon was its use of &quot;evolution&quot;, which stirred up all the hyper-conservative people, who completely failed to notice that the in-game version of it was more akin to metamorphosis.<br>Anyway, congratulations!

            <p>Hoom, hoom.<br><b>Activity:</b> Yep, you&#39;re active enough, and - surprisingly - you&#39;ve been here for over a month! I didn&#39;t quite realise that. All good, here.<br><br><b>PPC knowledge:</b> Your prompts don&#39;t contain any mistakes that I can spot and I know that you can a) ask questions or b) look for the answers yourself, so you&#39;re good here.<br><br><b>Fic to spork:</b> Yeah, that&#39;s a Sue, aright, and something in the writing made my head swim (ha, ha). One question, though: what&#39;s it&#39;s fandom? Closest I think about is Disney&#39;s <i>Little Mermaid</i>, but if that&#39;s the case, well... that&#39;s not the <i>Little Mermaid</i> I remember watching when I was ten.<br><br><b>Writing ability (creative):</b> The prompts are funny - especially the random one, I like what you did with the sneak-thieving mini-Aragog there - and the characters are good. I do have one concern - while your writing is by no means purple, it&#39;s a bit too florid, in my opinion, so it would do you good to pay attention to this particular aspect of it; since you seem to be on it already, you&#39;re good to go.<br><br><b>Writing ability (technical):</b> You&#39;re good. There are a couple of mistakes (.. instead of an ellipsis in the control prompt, a misspelled sandwich in the other prompt&#39;s title) but they&#39;re nothing glaring and the sort of thing a beta would catch, anyway.<br><br>Therefore: <s>Permission granted</s><br>I, Baron Thanasius Ampelius of the Monastery of Spectacle in the Refuge of Ozerbord, in accordance with the Edict of Bast and the laws of the land, do grant you the title of Knight, and with it the obligation to fight the Marizu wherever they may be found.<br>Rejoice!</p>

            <p>Dewott is just the perfect combination of cute and cool-looking. It&#39;s my favorite Water-type starter (maybe even favorite Water-type in general). Meanwhile, Samurott&#39;s just kind of... blah. Not <i>bad</i>-looking exactly, but design-wise Dewott&#39;s got leagues on it. I feel the much same about Servine vs Serperior too.

            <p>Serperior has a much less versatile attacking move pool, I&#39;ll grant you that, but the combination of that weirdly high speed, decent bulk and a, frankly, under-appreciated status movepool grants some pretty great support/annoyance potential. The Serperior on my Grass team has even managed to rival my Whimsicott&#39;s staying power with a combination of clever (read: annoying) tactics and draining moves (admittedly, in a previous generation.

            <p>Grass as an attacking type has always been subpar, and you can&#39;t really use Leaf Storm because so much resists it. Serperior&#39;s bulk is... acceptable? Sort of? It&#39;s about average, really, but Grass is frankly one of the more ropey defensive typings. The Ground-type resistance is useful, I&#39;ll grant you, but it&#39;s weak to a combination of total rubbish and very common coverage moves like Flamethrower. Poison being super-effective also hurts, as Poison-types are experiencing something of a renaissance in Gen VI with the advent of Fairy-type and its weaknesses to pollution (thanks Ferngully fairies) and cold iron (thanks High European we-spell-it-with-an-ae-cuz-it-am-the-cool faeries). It can offer some useful stuff, but pure Grass-type&#39;s actually quite rubbish.<br><br>That said, STAB Leaf Storm&#39;ll cover a multitude of sins after a decent boost, and it does have access to Giga Drain if memory serves, so whack on an AssVest and a couple of other coverage moves (does it get Earth Power? idk) and give it 128 EVs in Special Attack and Special Defense along with 252 in Speed. It&#39;ll be handy as a lategame sweeper or for use as a wallbreaker against bulky walls. =]</p>

            <p>Apparently, this is the optimal competitive set on Showdown:-<br><br><b>Serperior</b> @ Life Orb<br>Timid Nature<br>IVs: 29 HP (all others standard - this spread decreases the damage from your LO)<br>252 SpA/4 SpD/252 Spe<br>Leaf Storm<br>Dragon Pulse<br>Hidden Power Fire<br>Giga Drain<br><br>There are arguments to be made for Glare, Taunt, and Synthesis in that last slot, but a boosted Giga Drain can heal a lot and still do decent damage. Dragon Pulse is there for coverage and HP Fire is the way to go - there are arguments for HP Ground, chief among them being Heatran, but Fire hits more stuff harder, like Scizor and Ferrothorn. It has a simple function, that being Leaf Spam and its inbuilt Nasty Plot, and it&#39;s effective in OU, especially because of its ability to outspeed common threats unboosted - and since it can&#39;t boost its speed because Contrary, that&#39;s an important thing to remember.<br><br>Its bulk ain&#39;t great and sometimes it fails in its duty to OHKO bulky Water-types (though Mega Swampert gets rekt), but there&#39;s quite a lot to like about Serperior. Hopefully its inevitable Mega retains Contrary and a halfway-decent secondary typing. It&#39;d be interesting for it to get, say, Dragon-type and have it be some kind of Eastern wyrm-lookin&#39; thing, and it&#39;d fit in with the regal theme it&#39;s got going on - plus, Dragon Pulse is about the only proper coverage move it <i>has</i>, so, y&#39;know, there&#39;s that. Ground-type would also be interesting if it got some proper coverage, though that nasty 4x weakness to Flying is unpleasant in a tier with Talonflame in it.<br><br>Please accept my apologies: Serperior <i>is</i> superior, and I was wrong to assert otherwise. =]</p>

            <p>It&#39;d be completely appropriate too, considering the connection between Serperior and its preeveolutions to the sun, according to the Pokedex (which hasn&#39;t really seen any in-game utility thus far). Instead of Contrary, then, it could have Drought. It&#39;d lose it&#39;s free boost with Leaf Storm, but you could, say, keep it unevolved for a turn or two to set up, then evolve and wreck with Flamethrower and Giga Drain. They&#39;d have to give it a completely new set of moves to account for the type change, but it&#39;d not be the first time that&#39;s happened (coughcoughHeracrosscough).<br><br>Whatever typing they give it though, lots of gold ornamental fringes and frills and a massive headdress is definitely the to go.

            <p>I tried to get the Notary to use &#39;mons that reflected both her personality and her approach, which is to come at things a bit sideways and crush the foe completely, hence Persian. As an aside, I was debating whether or not to use a physical set with Covet, Bite (90 BP, 30% flinch hax chance, what&#39;s not to love?), Aerial Ace, and U-Turn and kick her out as a lead/scout, but she&#39;s a bit fragile for that and besides, it gives the Venomoth another person to QuiverPass to. Seriously, Quiver Dance is such a brilliant boosting move. The only better one I can think of is Shift Gear, and that really only benefits Sharpedo and Talonflame (because Talonflame needs more speed. =])<br><br>But yeah, I actually made this team on Showdown if you ever feel like having a go against Tree.

            <p>Its special movepool is basically Grass and Dragon, and because Dragons are kind of going out of style thanks to the aforementioned Fairy type, without STAB to make those moves more effective, its special coverage potential is pretty abysmal. Contrary does somewhat make up for this, of course (a Leaf Storm-Boosted Hidden Power can be pretty devastating) but the lack of stronger coverage moves hurts pretty badly. That said, the physical movepool is so much more promising, boasting the likes of Aqua Tail, Outrage and Knock Off. With Coil, it could even perhaps make Iron Tail work. If they added Superpower or Horn Leech to the mix (unlikely though that is), Physical Serperior might actually have some presence.<br><br>All that said, I may have to concede that my beloved Support Serperior no longer works in this generation. In fact, my entire Grass mono seems hopelessly, utterly outmatched. It&#39;s going to take some major tweaking to get them back in working order.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m planning on writing something romantic, but I&#39;ve never been in a romantic relationship,(except for crushes, do those suck) and my original plan was to just smash them together and yell &quot;Friends!&quot;, until I could start yelling &quot;KISS!&quot;, but I wanted to avoid common tropes that aren&#39;t true anyway, and also because I tend to avoid romance novels(yes yes, i&#39;m a hypocrite) so I don&#39;t know what to avoid. Just send me tips and stuff, because the world and history for them is malleable as anything, and is subject to change, so I&#39;ll have to work them out myself.<br><br>If you have a post for this already (you definitely do but anyway), I suppose you could link me to that.<br><br>Also notes for building friendships because I don&#39;t have good friendships to work off.</p>

            <p>I guess the idea of struggling with writing romance is a little weird to me, because I&#39;m a natural shipper; if I really like the chemistry between two characters, I end up writing a romance between them in my head.  That doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m <i>good</i> at it; it just means that I tend to do it without really thinking about it.  Also, I tend to like relationships that are messed-up on some level, so they&#39;re not necessarily the healthiest couple either, but a perfect relationship doesn&#39;t necessarily make for a good story.<br><br>So I&#39;d look at what dynamics you like in fictional couples, if you don&#39;t have a real-life example to draw on.  Which characters, if any, do you ship, and why?  Are there any romances you&#39;ve read that worked for you?  Examine what draws you to those couples.  I&#39;m assuming you&#39;re dealing with original fiction, or at least original characters.  Don&#39;t necessarily rip off canons that you like, but just use them as a source of inspiration.<br><br>Another good idea would be to check out blogs that review romance novels; lots of times, the commentary on what they did and didn&#39;t like in a novel can give you a good perspective on what works for people and what doesn&#39;t.<br><br>Finally, I don&#39;t know the context for what you&#39;re writing, but I wouldn&#39;t recommend writing characters around the romance, unless you&#39;re specifically writing a romance novel or something.  Sometimes things not working out makes for a better story than when things do.  </p>

            <p>My girlfriend and I were friends for six years, then developed mutual crushes last year, and got together recently. It isn&#39;t much different than being friends, and we haven&#39;t kissed yet -- we&#39;re going slow in the hopes of avoiding the curse of high school relationships -- it&#39;s basically a friendship, except with mutual attraction and more physical contact. Things will probably be different if/when we make it to the &quot;fall in love&quot; bit, but it seems to be working for us. :)<br><br>(To forestall any confusion: yes, I am a girl.)</p>

            <p>I would recommend reading the older classic romance stories (i.e. &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;, &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;, etc.).  And look into the historical backgrounds of those stories, too.  <br><br>You will end up using some of the old tropes (it&#39;s kind of impossible to avoid all of them), but the trick is to know how to use them properly.

            <p>Somewhat inspired by the thread below, what PPC characters do you ship?  What makes you think they work well together?  Are they canon pairings, or is there no evidence outside of your head?<br><br>My choices:<br><ul>
<li>Jay/Acacia - Okay, so technically this is less based in canon, and has more to do with <a href="http://fanfic_land.webs.com/FfW/Story41-1.htm">this goodfic entry in the Badfic Games</a>.  But the way it was written made me love it in canon, too.<br>
</li>
<li>Trojie/Pads - A classic pairing.  I love their dynamic and the (NSFW!) <a href="http://rc45.dreamwidth.org/70192.html">fic where they finally get together</a> is probably my favorite slash fic that I&#39;ve read.<br>
</li>
<li>Valon/Kala - I&#39;m fairly proud of myself on this one, because I was shipping them before it was canon. (/hipster)  I feel like they&#39;ve always had a lot of chemistry, and it&#39;s really cute to see Valon become an ascended fanboy of sorts.  I&#39;m looking forward to seeing where they take it from here!<br>
</li>
<li>Iximaz/Thanasius - Not a PPC pairing so much as a Plort pairing.  But once again, I was shipping it before it was canon.  I actually came very close to mentioning it after reading <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YT8mFpNNY-Ard9zeF_hq-s94j7SsW6KGUWPNkineoig/edit">this fic</a>, but I didn&#39;t want to say anything, since it&#39;s on the border between shipping characters and shipping writers.  It&#39;s nice to see I was right.<br>
</li>
<li>Jenni/Supernumary - This is probably the one I feel the most guilty about.  I know that Nume isn&#39;t interested in a relationship with anyone, and I really shouldn&#39;t be shipping him at all, but he&#39;s so tsundere with Jenni that I can&#39;t resist.<br>
</li>
<li>Ilraen/Zeb - Easily the crackiest pairing on the list, since they&#39;ve never interacted in any way.  The only &quot;evidence&quot; I have is that Zeb likes the <i>Animorphs</i>.  But they&#39;re both sweet-natured, innocent nonhumans, and I picture them being very cute together.  The fact that they both have explicitly bishonen human forms doesn&#39;t hurt, either.  But seeing as Iximaz and Neshomeh are working on a co-write, maybe it will end up being more canon that it seems?</li>
</ul>
<br>As a side note, please don&#39;t take this the wrong way if I didn&#39;t mention a couple.  It doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;re poorly written; as you can probably tell, I have kind of weird taste.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m going to take a different approach to shipping.  Instead of one type of relationship, I am going to look at four.  This is <a href="http://mspaintadventures.wikia.com/wiki/Quadrants">Homestuck-style Quadrant Shipping</a>.<br><br>Quadrant 1: Flushed - The one you already know about.  Romantic Love.<br><br>Xericka/Gremlin - Go read <a href="http://vgdivision.dreamwidth.org/5595.html">this story</a> and you will know why I ship it.<br><br><br>Quadrant 2: Pale - This one is interesting because it is really what every agent pair should be.  Opposites that balance each other.  Non-Romantic.<br><br>Suicide and Diocletian - She brings common sense to balance his suicidal tendencies.  He brings down-to-Earth-iness to balance her Sueish tendencies.  They know how to handle each other.<br><br><br>Quadrant 3: Ashen - A weak relationship based on strife or competition.  The thing that makes this interesting is that there is a third partner, who mediates and keeps things from getting out of control.  Non-romantic.<br><br>Nume/Jenni/Ilraen - Nume is a difficult person to be around.  I know, shocker.  Occasionally friction between him and Ilraen gets to a point where they need a mediator.  Jenni is an insufferable busybody, which makes her perfect for that role.  She keeps things from boiling over between the partners.<br><br><br>Quadrant 4: Caliginous - A pair who are attracted to each other despite severe dislike.  Pretty foreign to most people.  Romantic Hate.<br><br>Suicide/Nume - Read <a href="http://starshadowhall.tripod.com/ppc/rc999/05rc.html">this mission</a> and tell me they shouldn&#39;t just get a room.  Also a popular choice in the Badfic Game.<br><br><br>There are more examples of each, of course.  The PPC is practically built on Pale relationships.  These are just a few that I like.<br><br>-Phobos, complicating simple things since 1986</p>

            <p>Other than canon ships.  Like Nesh said, I&#39;m not usually looking for them.  I do tend to notice them coming before the author reveals them, though.  I guessed at Lee/Ian before it happened.<br><br>I guess I&#39;m kind of leaning towards Laura Dukes/Danny Richardson?  And I sort of thought Nathan/Ellipsia was going to be a thing, but EllipsisFlood seems to have left, which makes me sadface.  :(</p>

Yes, I know he&#39;s married, but come on - the DIA and Intel hung out together during Crashing Down, and I&#39;m sure their lead agents got to spend a lot of time in each other&#39;s company.

            <p>Aside from that, however, the only other pairing that I can see as being sensible without gutting the PPC canon would probably be my own Cupid with eatpraylove&#39;s Violet, because the latter was paired with Pit when the former was still possessing him.

            <p>It&#39;s more like killing a zombie than carrying out an execution.<br><br>They&#39;re people-shaped and they look like people, but they don&#39;t act like people. They don&#39;t have full personalities, and the ones in the published missions are usually not salvageable.<br><br>Every once in a while there&#39;ll be a salvageable one, and those are the ones that get recruited. Even then, they aren&#39;t full-fledged characters at recruitment. They have to go through FicPsych and become more complex and three-dimensional. <br><br>But that&#39;s just the theory. The actual agents may see it many different ways. Some of them may see it as sad but necessary. Some may see themselves as soldiers and the Sue as the enemy. Some may enjoy getting revenge or just enjoy the challenge (nothing says our agents can&#39;t have a sociopathic streak). I even recall one particular dinosaur agent who sees the hunt for &#39;Sue about the same way a lion would see the hunt for gazelle.<br><br>If your character really and truly hates killing things, including Mary Sues, zombies, and cockroaches, they may not survive long in the DMS. Usually, they drift toward Bad Slash, Intel, or the DIC, or a non-action job. <br><br>Gotta admit it: Those Sues and Stus do look an awful lot like people. And however much your agents remind themselves that they aren&#39;t people, there&#39;s a sentimental tendency that says that if it&#39;s person-shaped and pleads for its life, it just might be a person. Doesn&#39;t matter that it bleeds glitter and makes horribly-spelled entreaties to an ensnared lust object; emotions don&#39;t always follow logic and emotions can easily say, &quot;Hey! That&#39;s a person! You&#39;re not a cold-blooded murderer!&quot;<br><br>How do you deal with killing something that looks and feels a lot like a person, at least at first glance?

            <p>Unfortunately, I don&#39;t think either of my agents are self-aware enough to really give a proper response to the question, so I&#39;ll answer from an out-of-universe perspective.<br><br>Aaron has a somewhat complex moral code that mostly comes from his home continuum.  There actually is a karma scale in the Fallout games, but your karma only takes a hit from killing people if they&#39;re good.  If it&#39;s listed as a hostile, you can kill it in its sleep without taking a single penalty.  If the person you kill is evil enough, you can actually get karma points for killing them.  So for him, killing an evil being like a Sue isn&#39;t something bad; it could even be argued to be a morally good act.  In character, Aaron would probably say something along the lines of &quot;They&#39;re monsters, just ones that look like humans.&quot; <br><br>Natasha, to be frank, has probably killed people more innocent than your average Mary Sue; the organization she was supposed to be a member of isn&#39;t exactly a pleasant one.  Her philosophy is that it&#39;s better to kill one person than to allow many people to suffer; she&#39;s aware that <i>her</i> home continuum has already indicated that this is an ultimately destructive outlook, and on some level she&#39;s accepted that it&#39;s her fate to end unhappily.</p>

            <p>That&#39;s like feeling guilty about every bacterium that dies when you wash your hands or clean the kitchen. It is exactly the wrong way to look at things. The only time I&#39;ve tried to make a character who thought about things that way was Algie, and... well, Algie has something of an excuse for thinking like that.<br><br>You can also look at it like warfare. US military training tends to emphasise teaching your ground troops to totally dehumanise the enemy. That way you don&#39;t have to feel any of that complicated &quot;ethics&quot; nonsense in the middle of a firefight and get yourself and your friends shot. I imagine a similar process occurring among the PPC agents kind of by osmosis, with veteran agents becoming hardened to the job (or going flamethrower crazy) and newer ones not feeling the same way. It&#39;d be an interesting take on a central part of the PPC dynamic, and I&#39;d definitely be up for exploring that in Interludes. Possibly involving FicPsych. =]</p>

            <p>It&#39;s a matter of doing what we&#39;re supposed to be doing. We can&#39;t just burst into a mission with full intent to kill. <i>That</i> is murder. <br><br>Observing the story, what the author is trying to do, and the character(s) within the story as well as what charges can be determined are all very important things to do, as part of procedure.<br><br>That limits any guilt, and as for limiting trauma, it&#39;s simply something you need to get used to, and the best way to do that is by not taking it too far out of bounds.

            <p>Have you <i>seen</i> what those Sues do to the canon worlds, to the characters? Forcing the canons to act against their most basic natures, forcing the canons to fall in love with them, torturing the canons, killing canons if they get in the way of the Sue&#39;s preferred ship? Messing with the laws of nature itself? It&#39;s horrible, what it is.<br><br>Honestly, the most traumatizing part of the job is having to see what the Sues force the canons to go through.

            <p>How does one handle Marvel or DC in the Department of Implausible Crossovers?  They have crossovers within their own story-lines.  Also DC crossed over with &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; and Marvel with &quot;Street Fighter&quot;.  </p>

            <p>I think the Marvel and DC universes are both pretty immune to the &quot;implausible&quot; part of that department.

            <p><i>&quot;Due to continuous retconning and a usually sliding timescale, sometimes it can be hard to decide on what is really canon in a fanfic set in the DC Universe. According to the PPC Manual, this has made most agents give up on it, but some still accept missions there.&quot;</i> - Quote from <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/DC_Universe">here.</a><br><br>Meaning that is hard to determine what is <i>canon</i>, no what is badfic. (In fact, there&#39;s at least <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bx8NQGnXoTUb1uuKhDdJuL9xswarqKTyI3biH11DayE/edit">one mission</a> for the Main DCU.) The major problem with the canon, is not if something is or isn&#39;t,  <i>is to try to figure out from which canon it comes from.</i> Why? Fans tend to combine, confuse and fuse elements and facts from Live-Action Movies, Animated Movies, Animated Series, Live-Action Series, Elseworlds/What if?/Alternate timeline/universe comics and Mainstream comics in their fanfics, and badfics usually top it off with misleading Fanbrat speculative ramblings, which are almost always wrong. So, if you want to take on a DCU or MU badfic, no one is going to stop you, but it&#39;ll be a very challeging endeavor, that will probably require you to have some sort of encyclopaedia on your side to take on. <br><br>And that&#39;s why Shattered Sanity is the only one to ever take on a Main DC Universe badfic so far, and even then, she took only one. </p>

            <p>Because I&#39;m having a hard time imagining <i>Metropolis</i> in Middle-earth. <br><br>You see, most of the implausibility coming out from badfic crossovers involving the DCU or the MU, is because of badly used elements from those universes. Like <i>Gotham City</i> existing within the Fire Nation, and The Batman&#39;s indentity still being <i>Bruce Wayne</i>. Things like that are highly implausible in the Avatar-verse. And yes, what I just described, some else wrote it already.<br><br>So, in short, while almost everything is plausible within superhero continua, that doesn&#39;t mean that it is plausible in the other continuum it is crossed over with.</p>

            <p>And also, Bruce Wayne is misplaced too, again, with no explanation given.<br><br>But that wasn&#39;t the point, it was just an example of how a crossover involving a mainstream superhero continuum can go wrong, mainly by shoehorning an <i>element</i> from one, into another universe where it cannot exist or introduced with no explanation/justification. More examples?<br><br>- The Flash using Super-speed, in an universe with no <i>Speed Force</i>.<br><br>- A character receiving a Green Lantern Ring, when its personality clearly doesn&#39;t match the Ring&#39;s requirements (capable of overcoming a great fear).<br><br>- Making Adamantium and/or Vibranium deposits in places where there&#39;s no way those could have ever existed.<br><br>- Somehow replicating Captain America&#39;s shield... in an universe where the material of what it&#39;s made doesn&#39;t exist.<br><br>- Make Shazam/Capatin Marvel call down the lighting in a universe where the Greek pantheon, the Roman pantheon and/or Solomon don&#39;t exist or have never existed.<br><br>- Let any magical superhero/supervillian use its magic in an universe where its magic doesn&#39;t work that way, or doesn&#39;t exist at all.<br><br>And there are of course, the standards: awful grammar, unexplained OOC, unexplained character transplantations, a Replacement every once in a while, trivialization of canon events, etcetera. <br><br>So, yeah, there are many, many ways to get  a DCU or MU implausible crossover.</p>

            <p>There may be plenty of good reasons, but then there are also plenty of <i>bad</i> reasons, such as &quot;the author felt like it.&quot; No good explanation, no plausibility. And then you have to look at the follow-through. Unless you&#39;re going with something like one of the comic book universe&#39;s god-like beings rewriting reality for a laugh, the sudden presence of a modern city in a pre-modern world should cause quite a stir.

            <p>...and all due respect to the Betaing Council--that one&#39;s intentional. The idea was that we jump back (in time) a tiny bit--the Fisherman would have had to be walking extremely slowly to have only reached Morgan after Kozar had spoken to Rina and the Librarian *and* gone on to be hugged by the Reader, and while he did start out trudging, he seems to have started running at some point. Guess it&#39;s not quite as obvious that it&#39;s not consecutive as I thought. Maybe it could be changed to the following?<br><br><i>Fisherman: [has run over to Morgan, tripping over his too-large shoes] Morgan, make him stop! He’s being mean!</i><br><br>(Morgan is definitely one of my favorites in this, actually. So teenager-y. Admittedly, it&#39;s pretty hard to choose a consistent favorite, but she has some of the very best lines.)<br><br>Also funnily enough, I&#39;ve been catching other tiny things on my read-through this morning. Some of it&#39;s just stylistic or a missing comma, but there&#39;s also one instance of a line being changed and the reply not following suit. Luckily, it&#39;s just a matter of removing one word. Fixes to follow.<br><br>I&#39;m glad you enjoyed it, though :) We did rather try to emulate the style of Gallifrey Bickers; it does seem to have turned out shorter, but hopefully otherwise it&#39;s a good spiritual sequel.<br><br>~DF</p>

            <p><i>RC #227:</i><br><br>&quot;Well,&quot; said Falchion as he read the mission report, &quot;it was about time somebody else in our department killed a badfic of their own creation.&quot;<br>&quot;To be quite honest, I will have to say &#39;au contraire&#39; to the notion that you were the one who wrote my homefic,&quot; Ripper replied. &quot;I was angry at you back then because I thought you were the Stu, not the writer.&quot;<br>&quot;All the same, Terrordactyl was a self-insert. Isn&#39;t that the same thing? I mean, Midnight Green was one too as far as Valon is concerned.&quot;<br>&quot;...Huh. Good point.&quot;<br>&quot;At any rate, I have to give it to Valon - he handled things a lot better than we did. I don&#39;t think Rosie&#39;s going to forget being sent to Medical for heart failure anytime soon!&quot;<br>Ripper blinked in surprise. &quot;Heart failure?&quot;<br>&quot;Did I tell you that? I think I did. Did I?&quot;<br>&quot;...I don&#39;t remember, honestly. I wasn&#39;t there, after all. Must&#39;ve been what happened to that one antagonistic replacement, right?&quot;<br>Falchion sighed and shook his head. &quot;Apparently.&quot;<br>It was then that Ripper remembered something Falchion had said just now. &quot;Wait, Midnight Green? Isn&#39;t that a Suvian name in of itself?&quot;<br>&quot;Not in the context of <i>My Little Pony</i>. Especially the latest <i>Friendship is Magic</i> generation.&quot;<br>&quot;You have a little pony?&quot;<br>Falchion stared at him, open-beaked, and then facewinged in silent laughter. &quot;Oh, Ripper... You really <i>do</i> need to get out more.&quot;<br><br>**********<br><br>Fantastic work, all in all! There really should&#39;ve been more horse puns from everybody, honestly, but I&#39;ll live. Like I said, the only thing I&#39;m less than happy about is that Midnight Green didn&#39;t live and atone for his sins, because I was really hoping you&#39;d recruit the guy and have an ex-Stu agent for once, but I&#39;ll let that slide because you guys explained your reasoning to me yesterday. And I can understand your loss of interest in this show - it happened to me too after Season 3, albeit for different reasons, though I do have plans to catch up on the rest of the episodes once I get a job and such.<br><br>Oh, and regarding &quot;Raise This Barn&quot;: Whenever I hear that song (which is awesome btw), my walnut-sized brain always brings up the memetic Mondegreen of &quot;Racist Barn&quot;.

One thing that&#39;s certain, however, is that he ain&#39;t written by you, nor is he you.

            <p>Things that stand out so far? The way it being Valon&#39;s old badfic is handled (very satisfying, somehow), Zeb saying that Valon and Kala smell like Rina around the Librarian (best bit of teasing yet, I think), and, most especially, Valon trying to figure out unicorn magic.

            <p>See, I&#39;ve found more cowrite fodder: <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4951659/1/The-Legend-Of-The-Night-Angel">a crossover between Inheritance and Twilight</a>.<br><br>Now, I know the Inheritance Cycle pretty well. However, I know very little about Twilight in terms of its &quot;story&quot; and &quot;characters&quot; (and I&#39;m not keen to find out, because I&#39;m scared I&#39;ll enjoy it like I do Inheritance).<br><br>Bottom line: Anyone know Twilight who&#39;s a) willing to admit it, and b) willing to collab on this?<br><br>This also doubles as a new badfic thread, so... yeah. This fic kills Charlie. I don&#39;t know much about Twilight, but I know that Charlie Swan&#39;s supposed to be one of the series&#39; better characters.</p>

            <p>The problem wasn&#39;t strictly speaking SMeyer&#39;s increased influence, although that probably didn&#39;t help. For my money, it was more that it suffered from exactly the same problems as <i>Deathly Hallows Part 1</i>, only amplified by the fact that the overarching story of the <i>Twilight</i> series is retrograde, sexist garbage written by a religious weirdo I wouldn&#39;t trust to jot down a shopping list. They took the already boring first half of <i>Breaking <s>Yawn</s> Dawn</i> and made it even more dull, primarily because the cinematography made it feel like a feature-length version of a really pretentious perfume ad.<br><br>Breaking Dawn 2 isn&#39;t anywhere close to being a good film either, but I will say that the bit with the lion is absolutely hilarious and should be taught in film schools as an example of how to do basically everything wrong. That alone was worth the price of admission, as far as I&#39;m concerned. Also, in a deviation from the books, <i>something actually happens</i> in that installment: we see our friendly neighbourhood &quot;vegetarian vampires&quot; (tomatoes bewaaaaaaaare!) and the mates Carlisle scared up face off against the Volturi and... it works! It&#39;s a surprisingly competent action scene that only makes the one in <i>Eclipse</i> look even more laughably bad.<br><br>As an aside, my favourite quote about the final fight scene in <i>Eclipse</i> comes courtesy of MovieBob and is as follows:-<br><br>&quot;This isn&#39;t a vampire-versus-werewolf battle! This is a bunch of hipsters in a dog park.&quot;<br><br>hee. =]</p>

            <p>Thing is, the filmmakers managed to make halfway competent films out of books 1-3, mostly by deviating from said books. Meyer wouldn&#39;t let them do that to her ultimate fantasy, which is why Breaking Dawn became two films full of padding and very little else.<br>(goTeamVolturi)</p>

            <p>I&#39;m also among those who decided to check out the books when everyone else wouldn&#39;t stop reading them. I read the first three before going on vacation for a month or so and coming to my senses. Admittedly, that was a while ago; but I&#39;ve read several different sporkings of the series since (including Das Mervin&#39;s), and I&#39;d say I know a fair amount. (I also know where to find a Twilight wiki, and can search the sporkings for references if necessary). As to agents, I definitely have at least one (technically DMS, but she gets the odd temporary transfer) who would admit to reading the sporkings, if perhaps not the books; my DIC team...yeah, I think I can picture one or the other of them checking out some part of it. I&#39;d have to give a little more thought to who would work best, but I&#39;m sure it&#39;ll work for at least one of my agents or agent pairs.<br><br>Add in that I have some large pieces of free time on my hands, and I&#39;d say we&#39;re set (assuming you want to work with me to begin with). Also, the fic kills Charlie? That&#39;s making me kind of mad. Charlie...okay, Charlie&#39;s character gets mucked up, but he has a lot of awesome moments. Crowd favorite, of sorts. So. Mad. I&#39;m getting there.<br><br>How about it?<br><br>~DF</p>

            <p>--the Company Store owns the first (or thinks it does, anyway), and the second&#39;s already promised to me. But my email is dawnfire360 (at) gmail (dot) com, and my agents...well, I assume you mean the ones I mentioned, which makes them:<br><br>Dawn McKenna (DMS, Freelance)<br><br>and<br><br>Edgar Sullivan (DIC)<br>Agen_<strong><em>t (DIC, Edgar&#39;s partner. Four underscores)<br><br>All of them are on the wiki, and I don&#39;t currently think I have other--oh. Ohhhh.<br><br>I have other DIC agents, namely Kozar and the Reader. Kozar wouldn&#39;t have read the sporkings, though (the books...I don&#39;t even <i>know</i>, maybe he&#39;d read them to better know his enemy?) and the Reader wouldn&#39;t have bothered. Dawn is most likely the best bet, though Kozar could be tossed in as well--it would make some sense, as Dawn knows the sporkings, Kozar could know the books, and they used to be partners, which would make things very interesting. Added to that...Kozar&#39;s a Klingon. Sending him on a Twilight mission is sounding funnier to me with every moment I spend thinking about it.<br><br>Okay, then. I&#39;d like to put forth Dawn and Kozar as my agents for this. Edgar and Agen</em></strong><em>t could do in a pinch (or Kozar with Agen</em><strong><em>t, perhaps), but Agen</em></strong><em>t is probably the one more likely to have read any of this.<br><br>And that&#39;s most likely pretty confusing to look at. That&#39;ll teach me to do the working things out part elsewhere.<br><br>Summary: potential agents for this are:<br><br>Dawn and/or Kozar<br><br>Agen</em>___t (with or without Edgar)<br><br>I take it you&#39;ll be using Valon and Kala? We can decide which of my agents would work based on which of them would work better/more funnily/more interestingly with your agents. That&#39;s probably the best way to continue, now that I&#39;ve narrowed it down to who would even know the canon.<br><br>~DF</p>

            <p>That gives us only three more unknown wizarding schools left. Since Pottermore confirmed there are 11 schools in the world, we have:<br><br>1. Hogwarts (British Isles)<br>2. Beauxbatons (France and (?) central-western Europe: Belgium, Holland, etc.)<br>3. Durmstrang (Northern Europe)<br>4. Mahoutokoro (Japan and the isles around it (?))<br>5. Koldovstoretz (Russia and Eastern Europe (?))<br>6. Uagadou School of Magic (Africa)<br>7. Unnamed school in Brazil (Bill&#39;s pen-pal attended it)<br>8. The American school revealed now.<br><br>We can officially cross out the Salem Witches&#39; Institute, or brand it as a second-class school (something akin to Wizarding Academy of Dramatic Arts).<br><br>So - three more. Any ideas? I personally think Asia Minor woud have one - somewhere around Iraq, where the original city of Babylon was once raised... as for other two, I&#39;d say Australia - maybe somewhere close to the Ayers Rock? - and a total wild guess, North or South Pole.</p>

            <p>I like the idea of there being one around Babylon.  Egypt would be my other guess for one in the area.  There are already a lot in Europe, but I wouldn&#39;t be surprised by a Grecian one, either.<br><br>Perhaps one in India or China (or both)?  Japan isn&#39;t very big, so I doubt a school there could support all of Asia.  I&#39;d lean India more than China.<br><br>Definitely one in Australia, as it&#39;s pretty isolated from other areas.

            <p>Two American Schools, actually in a way make sense.  You can look at it this way, Witches and Wizards reflect a small percentage of the population at large, so it seems reasonable to infer that a larger concentration of population would mean a corresponding larger wizard population.  So look at the US, as of 2014 3rd Largest Country by Population and 4th Largest by Area.  It seems reasonable to infer that they would have a larger population of Wizards and Witches.  So I would suggest that Salem is still viable.<br><br>I would personally, again going of population, probably expect to see one in China and India.  Not to mention China and India have very old cultures.  But that&#39;s just my guess.</p>

            <p>Still does not mean that there is not a second US School.  But upon seeing information I previously did not have, I still think China and India make a lot of sense and I do think that somewhere in the former Persian and Babylonian Empires does make sense, though maybe in Mesopotamia.  How about the Gozer School of Magic?  Founded by Gozer the Gozerian in 6000 B.C.E.  But that leaves one question to that...<br><br>&quot;Who you gonna call?&quot;</p>

            <p>Originally, I thought about Spain, but that would give us too many European schools. Now though, I&#39;m thinking about Alexandria, Egypt. The library there was pretty darn famous.</p>
