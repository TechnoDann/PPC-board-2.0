            <p>Hi. Stumbled on here from TV Tropes a few weeks ago. Read some stuff, thought it looked awesome, so here I am. Any community that enjoys properly spelled fanfic is definitely good. Just one quick question, I found a page on the wiki that mentioned some fics it said I shouldn&#39;t have read ahead of time. Is that just a general warning for people who don&#39;t want to go utterly mad, or is that an actual warning? I&#39;m assuming the first, but it&#39;s always smart to check. Anyways, here I am!</p>

            <p>Wow, that is a lot of replies! Didn&#39;t know I was that interesting. A lot of you have been asking about my fandoms, so I guess I&#39;ll talk about that.<br><br>I really like Saints Row, GTA, Fallout, TES, Prototype, Infamous. Chances are, if it&#39;s fast paced, I&#39;ll enjoy it.<br><br>A few of you have also asked about whether or not I&#39;ve read the original series. I&#39;ve been unable to read the entire thing, but I&#39;ve gotten off to a good start. I&#39;ve also read around the wiki. Work and spotty internet connections will do that.</p>

            <p>Here, have a generic welcome gift, and please tell us more about you. Some of us prefer to give virtual welcome gifts that are actually meaningful, like something related to one of your fandoms or such. <br><br>Concerning your question, are you talking about Legendary Badfic? It’s difficult to give good advice while I don’t know whether you are a thirteen years old virgin or an adult sexmaniac with a fetish for chains and whips. So I can only say that any of these fics has the potential to ruin the respective fandom or your life for you. These things are Legendary for reasons, although the reasons may vary.

            <p>(Although, to be honest, I wasn&#39;t aware CATS even had a fanfiction community until about last year.)

            <p>There&#39;s a fic on the CATS archive I spotted that has a few danger signals. I&#39;m not declaring it badfic as it has only one chapter so far and the author says they have done &quot;a huge rewrite with many changes.&quot; I&#39;ll keep my eye on it, and hopefully it will turn out to be all right. It&#39;s called &quot;Three Jellicle Sisters.&quot;<br><br>So far it&#39;s problems are having an OC queen that&#39;s described as having muscles you could see underneath her pelt (I&#39;ve had plenty of pet cats, and the mollies were never that muscular), a paragraph of description about a pelt that has too many patterns and colors mentioned, related to Bombalurina and Demeter somehow without immediate explanation (though this may not be a charge if there&#39;s a good explanation later), having a name that&#39;s spelled wrong - Rosealeana - the annoying capitalization of a word after a quote ending as though beginning a new sentence when not actually doing that, and frequently forgetting periods.<br><br>Names are tricky when it comes to Jellicles. I wouldn&#39;t say her name is wrong, it&#39;s just misspelled. Anyway, I&#39;m gonna keep my eye on it and pray that it doesn&#39;t end up to become an obvious badfic. I&#39;ll leave a review and hope the reaction goes well. No flaming - I swear!</p>

            <p>I&#39;m... I&#39;m doing it wrong.<br><br>I heard about PTerry yesterday - well, the day before yesterday now, I suppose - and, well, I didn&#39;t really know how to take it. I&#39;d had a panic attack already that day for completely unrelated reasons, so I was doing my damnedest not to go into total shutdown-and-run-away &quot;FLEE! FLEE, FOR THE GODS ARE ANGRY!&quot; mode.<br><br>I&#39;ve read the obituaries, read the tributes, read every good thing the Internet has said about a good man taken by the cruelest sort of disease. In the words of Roland de Chumsfanleigh (whose fault it continues not to be) in <i>Wintersmith</i>, &quot;I hate things that take away what you are&quot;. It&#39;s an evil death, because memories don&#39;t just make you, they make the other people that you meet and know, and Alzheimer&#39;s and its affiliate indignities rips them up like old birthday cards, one by one, until you&#39;re left in a sea of strangers with only yourself for company, and then it takes that away from you too. It is decay given shape. I hate it.<br><br>I don&#39;t feel sad, though.<br><br>I don&#39;t feel anything at all.<br><br>There&#39;s just a void and a blank space, like the square of pristine paint on a wall where a picture used to hang, and I don&#39;t want that to be how he stops being in my life, though he never really was except with his words. I felt... before he left us, I felt that no matter how bad things got there would be new laughter just around the corner, in a place that wasn&#39;t here, for people that weren&#39;t me that I could be for a little while. Not too long, but long enough to like it.<br><br>It&#39;s selfish to talk about how he affected me when he&#39;s the one who&#39;s gone, but I don&#39;t know how else to frame it. He&#39;s gone, and I&#39;m numb, and there&#39;s a blank space on the wall.</p>

            <p>&quot;Doing my damnedest not to go into total shutdown&quot; is kinda how I feel right now, and frankly, I&#39;m not doing a very good job. The world is big and scary, and bad things happen to good people, and I&#39;d really rather just stay asleep, thanks. Plus, I&#39;m pretty sure my anti-anxiety medication is sort of pushing all my emotions aside, so although I&#39;ve been on the point of tears several times yesterday and today, with the tight throat and pricking lids and everything, there&#39;s been no waterworks. I sort of want to cry, because that&#39;s appropriate, so it&#39;s a little disconcerting that I can&#39;t seem to actually do it.<br><br>On the other hand, I gotta keep doing job search stuff, because paychecks are important, and that&#39;s hard enough without tears. On the OTHER other hand, being more or less emotionally numb isn&#39;t helping much with my motivation, either.<br><br>It&#39;s all just generally shitty. Basically what I&#39;m trying to say, though, is we&#39;re all stuck in our own heads, and there&#39;s not much we can do about it, so I don&#39;t think we need to feel too bad about framing things from our own point of view. It&#39;s the only one we&#39;ve got, after all, however inconvenient it may be. The trick is to remember that <i>everyone</i> is trying to get by with this narrow little window on reality, and biological equipment that&#39;s out of date and frankly lies to us a lot, and they&#39;re probably doing the best they can, so it&#39;s best to be patient with them, and ourselves.<br> <br>*offers hugs*<br><br>~Neshomeh <img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/PterryMemorial.png" alt="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/PterryMemorial.png"> </p>

            <p>I can only hope, that when it came to be his time, Death came to him and guided him to the next life.<br><br>Towards the end of his life, he was angry at the loss of his memories. Now, he has all of the memories of creation to look over. And as he looks back, seeing the collective memories of all who have passed before him, and all who still live, he will see just how many he entertained. How many he made laugh. How many he made ponder their reality. He will look back, and see the love and sorrow of those who knew him, even if only through his books, as they learn of his passing. Hopefully, he will look back on his life and smile.</p>

            <p>It was near the end of middle school and I had drifted away from fantasy. The traditional Tolkienian high magic kind of stuff no longer did it for me. Even Dungeons and Dragons had grown stale. I had migrated to mysteries and giant doorstop thrillers.<br><br>And then, while I was on vacation in Florida, my grandmother bought a copy of <i>Witches Abroad</i> for me at a library charity sale. The dust cover was worn and the spine was practically broken. That combined with the cartoonish depiction of the main characters put me a little off. I didn&#39;t say anything -- you know, cause it&#39;s from my grandma and all. Still, despite my trepidation, I cracked open the book that night and began to read.<br><br>Cut to now. I still have that copy of <i>Witches Abroad</i> even though it&#39;s in even worse shape. I have almost every other Discworld book as well. While I still am not fond of traditional high fantasy, Terry Pratchett&#39;s works helped me see it in a new light. He showed me the gentle parody, simultaneously mocking while establishing a world that stands by itself. His words shaped mine, and for that I am forever grateful.<br><br><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/B_6ppf1UMAAM8jH.jpg"><br><br>Farewell.</p>

            <p>I loved Terry Pratchett so much and there is so much about Discworld that follows me around in everything that I do. I remember so vividly the first Discworld book I ever read. It was my best friend&#39;s copy of &quot;Wee Free Men&quot;. And I looked up to see the final book that Pratchett wrote and it was another Tiffany Aching book and I&#39;m actually crying right now.

            <p>Numbness, I suppose, only on an emotional level. Of course I&#39;ll get over it and move on, much as I always do with death, but losing two idols in close proximity has done a number to me. Not just me I suppose, as obviously losing Sir Terry has had an effect on not just myself or the community here, but the world at large. Hopefully, everyone affected will find something to comfort them through their emotional distress, and will come out mostly unharmed, or inspired even.</p>

            <p>Many of the greatest authors ever are, through the sheer unfairness of the universe, dead. Pterry is the most recent, of course. Now, when renowned and beloved <i>religious</i> figures die, they might get made into saints... so why not do the same with the authors we mourn?<br><br>I&#39;m leaving theology out of it (though the idea of dead authors interceding with a Great Author to demand a better plot has a certain appeal...); this is a liturgical calendar without the liturgy. It&#39;s just for fun, in other words (though if it produces enough results, I might add a page to the <a href="http://bonsaimallorn2.webs.com/">Temple of All Faiths</a>).<br><br>Here&#39;s the ones I&#39;ve come up with:<br><hr>
<br>Saint Pterry of Ankh<br><br>Patron of: Humour, primates, turtles.<br><br>Symbols: the Ankh, the Lilac. <img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/PterryMemorial.png"><br><br>Feast Day: 25th May (the Glorious Twenty-Fifth)<br><br><i>On the Glorious Twenty-Fifth, it is traditional to bake a loaf of dwarf bread and refrain from eating it.</i><br><hr>
<br>Saint Douglas of the Galaxy<br><br>Patron of: Humour, travellers.<br><br>Symbol: the Towel.<br><br>Feast Day: 25th May (Towel Day)<br><br><i>The traditional feuds between those who wish to venerate Saint Douglas and those who prefer Saint Pterry have been overcome in recent years by the creation of lilac towels.</i><br><hr>
<br>Professor Saint Tolkien<br><br>Patron of: Fantasy, separated lovers, singers.<br><br>Symbols: the Star, the Ring, the Jewel.<br><br>Feast Day: 25th March (the end of the Third Age)<br><br><i>Celebrating Professor Saint Tolkien, followers will eat a Hobbitish meal in the evening and then spend the night under the stars.</i><br><hr>
<br>Saint Anne of Dragonhold<br><br>Patron of: Riders, musicians, pilots, astronauts.<br><br>Symbol: the Dragon.<br><br>Feast Day: 1st January (TurnOver)<br><br><i>Saint Anne is best remembered with a mug of hot</i> klah.<br><hr>
<br>What can you add? The only requirement is that they have to be... y&#39;know... dead. Living saints tend to be a bit awkward.<br><br>hS <img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/PterryMemorial.png"></p>

            <p>I may or may not have been thinking of you, when I wrote that someone who knows C. S. Lewis better than me should totally write one for him. ^^<br><br>I love Diana Wynne Jones&#39; books. Howl&#39;s Moving Castle and the Chrestomanci series were some of my absolute favourites when I was a child. And she attended lectures by both C. S. Lewis and J. R. R. Tolkien in Oxford. She wrote a wonderful, funny piece about how Tolkien was as a lecturer; I think it&#39;s in the collection Everard&#39;s Ride.</p>

            <p>From Terminator Fanfiction, I present Terminator 3 A New Life. It&#39;s about the Skynet Program, who managed to send itself back in the timeline of Terminator: Sarah Connor Chronicles. It takes its own interpretation of the world of Terminator and reapplies it to the plot of T:SCC. It deviates a bit far from T:SCC while making it a rough guideline, but expands the Terminator world even more.<br><br><a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4045203/1/Terminator-3-A-New-Life"><a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4045203/1/Terminator-3-A-New-Life">https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4045203/1/Terminator-3-A-New-Life</a></a><br><br>I have no idea what do you think of Dakari-King Mykan, but I find his self-inserts rather entertaining.

            <p>Among the MLP fandom (as several others have turned to for their recommendations), my love goes out to <a href="http://www.fimfiction.net/story/12047/the-marvelous-adventures-of-pinkie-pie-crasherdude-awesome-vs-mooncloud-shadowdancer">these</a> <a href="http://www.fimfiction.net/story/155824/diamond-tiara-hunts-down-and-systematically-murders-bad-ocs">two</a> fics especially, due to their hilarious deconstruction of common Mary Sue tropes (and the latter being one of the reasons that I know of the PPC besides).<br><br>Outside of the bronydom, there&#39;s also <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9884742/1/Tangled-Adventures-in-Arendelle">this</a>​ Frozen/Tangled crossover. These are two continua that are known to have coexisted, and this fic explores that with everyone in character. And it&#39;s amazing.</p>

            <p>And that would be <a href="http://www.fimfiction.net/story/119190/fallout-equestria">Fallout: Equestria</a>, one of the most well known MLP fanfics. I adore this fic. I love the characters, I love the themes it explores, I love the setting, I love everything about this fic. I have talked extensively about this fic before on this very board, but I will gladly plug it again.<br><br>Now, some warnings. This is My Little Pony crossed with Fallout. You do not need knowledge of the Fallout universe. In fact, it&#39;s probably better if you do <i>not</i> know the Fallout setting. Trust me, when I first read it, I had never played a Fallout game, and I still loved it. That said, this is also a mature rated fic, for very good reason. There are drugs, violence, swearing, and heavy sexual themes. This is not a light and fluffy story (though there are some lighter moments.) If you do not like dark stories, especially when put in Equestria, then this fic is not for you. If you are easily disturbed, this fic is probably not for you. A good test is this: can you make it through Ponyville? If yes, strap in, you are in for an amazing ride. If not, fine. Just hop off there, and feel no shame for not liking it. </p>

            <p>The are of course OFUM, Suedom and HFA. Suedom was actually the first fanfic I ever read. Which probably explains a lot now that I think about it.<br><br>But setting these well known works aside, my favourite is A Bed of Thorns by Nym. Warning, NSFW, contains tastefully naughty bits. <a href="http://archiveofourown.org/works/377718/"><a href="http://archiveofourown.org/works/377718/">http://archiveofourown.org/works/377718/</a></a> It&#39;s a Once Upon a Time fic, set in an AU where Rumpelstiltskin married Belle and where Storybrook never happened. (I think. It&#39;s still a work in progress.)<br>Its focus is mostly on character and relationship development. Also, it is a prime example of how good erotica can be when it&#39;s written by someone who actually knows how anatomy works.<br><br>And then there&#39;s my rec list: <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/PPC_Rec_Center/EileenAlphabet%27s_List"><a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/PPC_Rec_Center/EileenAlphabet%27s_List">http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/PPC_Rec_Center/EileenAlphabet%27s_List</a></a></p>

            <p>iheartmwpp&#39;s <i>Just Another Harry Potter Movie Parody</i> series. Absolutely hysterical. Her book parodies are also pretty great.<br><br>Also <i>Reverse</i> by Lady Moonglow: Excellent AU Dramione, where Hermione ends up in a parallel world where everything&#39;s reversed- the good guys are bad, the bad guys are good, Lily Evans is alive and terrifying to cross, Dumbledore&#39;s an evil overlord, Tom Riddle is a loving father, and Purebloods are tortured and kept as slaves. It&#39;s fairly grimdark and graphic, but so well-written!<br><br>Then there&#39;s <i>Against the Moon</i> by Stoplight Delight. It&#39;s a great account of the Marauders&#39; days at Hogwarts. At times hilarious and heartbreaking. Plus the author knows it ought to be set in the seventies, and makes references appropriately. We loves it, precious.<br><br>(My friends and I <i>love</i> Thirty Hs, it&#39;s hillaribad.)</p>

            <p>Since I am now on here I do not want what I think is just a dreadful story to pop up.  I wrote it quite a long time ago, and I feel like it is probably either very poor mediocre fanfiction or badfic.

            <p>Desdendelle&#39;s right. Nobody intentionally writes something that eye-searingly bad.

            <p>Anybody here a Teen Titans expert? Still on Kindle, still can&#39;t link, but it&#39;s another bleeding crossover with <i>Monster Musume</i>. It&#39;s called Daily Life of Beast Boy and the Monster Girls, and it&#39;s on FFNet.<br><br>What I find to be the case with most MonMusu crossovers is that they pretty much just replace Kimihito with whoever they decide to pair with the harem (I&#39;ve seen Beast Boy, Naruto and Harry Potter thus far). Other than using the new guy&#39;s personality, they almost exactly follow the plot of the manga. Usually, this means the MonMusu canons are all in-character, since they don&#39;t really do anything different.<br><br>There are exceptions (the fic I killed, for instance), but that&#39;s the general formula.</p>

            <p>While it has been a while since I watched the animated series, I think that is the feel the writer is going for.  Assuming this is the Animated Universe, I agree with you.  The characterizations are off, if not outright wrong. Particularly glaring for me was Raven.  Even in that small paragraph her characterization is just wrong.  To ensure I covered my bases, I performed a quick search through the DC Wiki.  This characterization does not seem to meet either Earth Prime Raven or New Earth Raven.  In other words, even at this early stage, Raven in this story does not fit Animated Raven, nor does she fit with either of DC&#39;s two main universes either.  She is, at least to me, fairly far out of character.  That being said, it is still early, but it seems fairly clear where it is going.  <br><br>I will also say that some of the typographical errors were particularly jarring.  As for the crossover I know nothing about the other series to make a determination one way or the other. <br><br></p>

            <p>That&#39;s the official title this side of the pond.<br><br>It comes highly recommended. By me. Let me put it this way: the only works of fiction I love more than MonMusu are Pokémon and A Song of Ice and Fire. <br><br>It&#39;s a fantastic manga, and for reasons that actually aren&#39;t fanservice-related. It actually goes into the monster girls&#39; cultures, biology, and the kind of welcome they receive among humans. It also happens to be the only thing I can stand that&#39;s almost exclusively romance.</p>

            <p>I might do that, though I tend to be cautious about what Anime/Manga I look into.  Partly because I have seen what can come along with it.  Rules 34, 35, and 36 seem to be easier to find without looking for them when it comes to Anime/Manga.  Also I do not have a clearly defined enough genre of what I like, I just know what I don&#39;t like when I see it.<br><br>Is there anything you might be able to compare it with?</p>

            <p>I mean, in Part 2, Zeb did mention something about meeting the Librarian. Maybe it can be more canonish once my agents make it <s>somwhat</s> in one piece.<br><br>Anyway, I&#39;m already nearly a quarter of the way through RPGoF. It&#39;s been a lot more fun to spork than PoA, probably because I&#39;m not nearly as emotionally invested in the canon book as I am HPPoA. Once I get to OotP, though? All bets are off. &gt;:D</p>

            <p>Dragonite with Multiscale works pretty well, since you can put it in as a revenge killer and make sure you get a good hit off. I prefer the physical attacking sort, so if you can get an Impish or Relaxed one and beef up its Attack and Defense, you&#39;re pretty much golden.<br><br>Also, if you hate Spiritomb, be glad you never played Gen.

            <p>Thankfully, there are three beautiful countermeasures: Foresight/Odor Sleuth (which removes the Ghost-type immunity to Fighting, let me just smack you right in the pusth, yes I grew up with Looney Tunes), passive damage (IT&#39;S RAINING SAND! HALLELUJAH, IT&#39;S RAINING SAND!), and Mold Breaker (Hello, I&#39;m Orlando the HaxoruOUTRAGE).<br><br>Of course, with Gen 6 this threat has been completely nullified thanks to the Fairy-type.

            <p>... would it be possible to alter a Pokemon to have a max health of 1 (a la Shedinja itself) and then give it a Focus Sash?

            <p>Wow. I&#39;m getting a slight headache, and this is only the <i>sporked</i> version! I&#39;d shudder to imagine how I&#39;d react to the badfic in all its &quot;glory&quot;.<br><br>How much does this leave behind? Three more to go? Good luck. How Rina is holding on without Bleep, I do not know. Perhaps Zeb will have to Thunder Wave her and carry her into FicPsych by the end of this &quot;septology.&quot;<br><br>Speaking of the mission, a few errors are still floating around:<br>1) <i>Rina and Zeb appeared in Ardgarten Forest...</i><br>I do not recall any forest by that name in the Harry Potter books, and a Google search reveals a forest in Scotland by the name of Ardgart<b>a</b>n. Perhaps this is a misspelling on your part?<br><br>2) <i>Cerelian asked Rose to <b>“[K]eep a strong lid on your instincts, it would not do for you to maul Mr Black.”</b></i><br>Given the way you introduce the quote, the structure is a bit off. Consider this instead: <i>Cerelian asked Rose to <b>“keep a strong lid on [her] instincts,&quot;</b> as <b>&quot;it would not do for [her] to maul Mr Black.”</b></i><br><br>3) <i>“Woah, when did you get so snarky?”</i><br>This is a very common misspelling. The word is spelled &quot;whoa.&quot;<br><br>4) <i>“Sorry, do humans not eat this part” he asked.</i><br>Missing question mark.<br><br>5) <i>Maybe a visit to PicPsych wouldn’t be a bad idea after this was all over.</i><br>I believe that you mean &quot;FicPsych.&quot; Though I would wonder what a &quot;PicPsych&quot; would be like. Perhaps a place where the doctors only use Rorschach tests? Or maybe it&#39;s a ward for those living pictures from the Harry Potter universe...<br><br>6) <i><b>“Oh, Gred and Forge, the looks on your faces,” I said, and took a bow. “My name is Prongs Jnr a pleasure to meet you.”</b></i><br>Unless Gred and Forge were caught in earlier parts of the &quot;septology,&quot; I believe that you missed two obvious mini-Aragogs. And unless &quot;Jnr&quot; is an acceptable abbreviation somewhere, wouldn&#39;t this make a mini-Sue?<br><br>7) <i>chapter seventeen, “The Golden Patronus”. The title alone was enough for both agents to give massive charges.</i><br>I don&#39;t get it. Could you please explain how the title is so charge-worhty?<br><br><br>And that&#39;s it for the grammar and comprehension errors. However, there&#39;s one thing more that I would like to bring up. Given what I&#39;m about to say, I&#39;ll first ask that everyone not give a knee-jerk reaction to my holding a contrary opinion, though correction is welcome if I speak amiss. That said:<br><br><i> “Rina, please, stop trying to play matchmaker! Besides, I…” He swallowed. “I’m not attracted to females.”</i><br>I know that you mentioned on the Board earlier that Zeb was going to be gay. However, I think that its introduction here was somewhat out of the blue.<br><br>Please allow me to explain.<br><br>The way that you&#39;ve been portraying Zeb thus far, it seemed like he was more of an innocent character, somewhat akin to Neshomeh&#39;s Agent Ilraen. That said, it would seem implausible that Zeb would be that knowledgeable about sexuality, much less be able to identify himself as homosexual.<br><br>This is not to say that it&#39;s impossible to have a character be revealed as gay over the course of one mission. For example, with Herr Wozzeck&#39;s DIC team (Florestan and Eusebius), there was nothing in previous missions to imply that either character was gay. Then, in the midst of the mission &quot;Blow All Your Canons Away&quot;, there came hint after hint showing the beginnings of something between Eusabius and the DoSAT Agent Zerenze.<br><br>In short, what I&#39;m saying is that IMHO, Zeb being gay looks like something just tacked on, given what we know about his character. I personally would suggest maturing him a bit more before going that route (if not just leaving him innocent--I love how you managed to play off his awkwardness at times!)</p>

            <p>All I&#39;ll say is that I&#39;m planning on ending Rose with a bang. :) <br><br>Rina&#39;s likely already insane, she&#39;s just good at faking normality. Because I doubt any sane person could survive in the PPC without Bleep.<br><br>1) It&#39;s some random forest Rose made up for the druids to run around in. Imma burn it down in the end. :D<br><br>2) I suppose I could rephrase that. I just like modifying the original quote as little as possible. I guess an exception could be made here.<br><br>3) I&#39;ve only ever seen it spelled woah. Phone&#39;s dictionary&#39;s saying it&#39;s a word. Weird.<br><br>4) Drat. Nice catch, thanks.<br><br>5) PicPsych uses those ink splotches. The name&#39;s escaping me right now, unfortunately. :P<br><br>6) Gred and Forge are their canon joke nicknames for each other. <i>&quot;We&#39;re not stupid, we know we&#39;re called Gred and Forge.&quot;</i> It&#39;s obnoxious when other characters do it, but technically not chargeable. As for Jnr... *is sheepish* Totally forgot to charge for that. Oops. *rubs forehead* Is my brain leaking from my ears?<br><br>7) Patronuses are <i>never</i> golden. Ever.<br><br>As for what you have left to say... *wince* Okay, yeah, I see your point. It did kind of come out of nowhere, didn&#39;t it? Oof, I messed that up. Okay, I&#39;ve already got an alternate version in mind that I&#39;ll edit in tomorrow (but unfortunately it&#39;ll have to wait). His naivete is just so much fun to write, but unfortunately won&#39;t last... I guess I was getting ahead of myself. <i>Rose Potter</i> is forcing them both to grow up fast, but you&#39;re right, it&#39;s too early for him to know. </p>

            <p>I don’t believe that these are really George and Fred’s nicknames for each other. They use them only once, implying that knitting their initials into their Christmas presents is a bad idea because now they can swap clothes to cause even more confusion than is caused by their indistinguishable looks anyway.<br><br>Fandom doing this again and again, emphasizing that the twins are oh-so-indistinguishable when their <i>personalities</i> are actually quite different, annoys me to no end. &quot;Gred and Forge&quot; don’t spawn mini-Aragogs, because they appear in canon.

            <p>God, the things you put yourself through.<br><br>Couple of things that stuck in my brain:-<br><br>When Rose shoves an elbow into Malfoy&#39;s guts, that in itself is another foul.

Also, I don&#39;t care if it was intentional, Quidditch with a Snitch is the single most pointless bloody game in human history. USE. A.

I&#39;d then have Wobbles insist on keeping it as a pet because she&#39;s just sort of, y&#39;know, like that.

            <p>Consider the Plumpton Pass. This (for non-Potterheads in attendance, or those Potterheads who go outside once in a blue moon) is a manoeuvre in which the Snitch, being about as bright as a 10-watt bulb covered in soot, actually flies <i>up the sleeve</i> of the Seeker, at which point automatic win for the Seeker&#39;s team barring circumstances so monumentally unlikely that the Weasley twins made a shedload of money off it happening during the World Cup final in GoF. In terms of game design it is, and I must censor myself here, a gobbet of half-chewed rat&#39;s anus.<br><br>Your remarks about finalists would be relevant in a league setup. However, we know that this is not necessarily the case for everything - as shown in GoF, with the Quidditch World Cup heavily implied to be a knockout tournament in the manner of the actual World Cup, complete with England scraping through to the knockout stages and crashing out ignominously to a country so obscure the UN has to check whether or not it actually exists. And yes, Quidditch is definitely wizard football. This is illustrated in <i>Quidditch Through The Ages</i>, which compares it to wizard American football (Quodpot, as she is known), which is like Quidditch but the balls explode. No, really.<br><br>I get that people want to like Quidditch, but as a sport it makes precisely zero sense to have it set up in the way that it is. You have the actual sport going on, which is alright and makes sense, and then you have the Seekers mucking about doing their own thing somewhere else, like they got lost. It doesn&#39;t work on any level, though it might - <i>might</i> - be improved if it didn&#39;t score any points.<br><br>Or better yet, USE. A. CLOCK.<br><br>Sorry, I tend to get up on my high horse about this. It&#39;s deliberate on Rowling&#39;s part, and that&#39;s fine, as a dig at the Byzantine rules of various school sports it&#39;s perfect. It&#39;s just that people think it&#39;s <i>not</i> a badly-designed mess of a game, and frankly, they&#39;re talking through their hats. =]</p>

            <p>Basically, she refuses to Teleport away because she wants to prove she&#39;s better than Voldemort. Heck, she lets Pettigrew tie her up and cut her arm for no reason.

            <p>Right, of course. The Sues expect the world to warp for them, so they can be taken by surprise when it doesn&#39;t. That makes sense. :-)<br>Oh, gods, Voldemort was so OOC in that chapter. Is he replaced, or just warped, do you think? Because taking out a replacement of a character with Horcruxes might be a challenge...<br>And I think that he might have made Snape fixate on Rose even more as a kind of replacement for his lost love. Then again, probably not. That actually sounds like it might create conflict, and Halcyon clearly doesn&#39;t want any of that.</p>

            <p><i>At long last, Rina gave up and lay on the grass, sobbing incoherently. </i><br><br>I wondered why there is grass at Diagon Alley. It took me some time to realize that Rina and Zeb are still at the edge of the forest, reading the words.<br><br><i>They skipped ahead to the last day of summer and took a much-needed break at Florean Fortiscue’s Ice Cream Parlor. </i><br><br>I assume they are still disguised in the same way they were at the end of <i>Rose Potter and the Chamber of Secrets</i>? And is this mini-Aragog spawned by your mission or by the badfic? I’m quite sure that it should be &quot;Florean Fort<b>e</b>scue’s Ice Cream Parlor&quot;<br><br><i>Zeb sighed and opened a portal, waiting while Rina set the D.O.R.K.S. Once they were disguised as a pair of Gryffindors, they headed onto the Hogwarts Express, skipping past pages upon pages of plagiarized canon. </i><br><br>Why do they need to change into Gryffindor students <b>now</b>? Last thing I remember is that they were Slytherin students at Valentine’s Day (well, actually I had to look this up). But then they portalled into the Gryffindor common room, so they probably had changed into Gryffindors off-page, and then changed again into something else off-page, and now they want to be Gryffindors again for no specific reason other than planning to sit at the Gryffindor table after <i>cleaning off the Chamber slime in the Prefect’s Bathroom</i>. (If they couldn’t be Gryffindors at Fortescue’s, because the Sue might have realized that she should – but doesn’t – know these fellow Gryffindor students, they should prefer to sit at another table.)<br><br><i>They followed the class to the staff room, Rina using the D.O.R.K.S. to change them into thirteen year-old Generic Students so they could slip in with the rest of the children.</i><br><br>Weren’t they already not so generic Gryffindor students fitting in there? Maybe they weren’t thirteen years old, but why was this no problem at the hippogriff paddock? The last two applications of the D.O.R.K.S. could just have been omitted and I would have assumed that Rina and Zeb were Generic Third Years fitting in all along.<br><br><i> “Fine, fine, lemme change our disguises first,” Rina said, digging out the D.O.R.K.S. “It’s gonna be cold outside.”<br><br>As soon as they were dressed in thick cloaks and scarves, the agents arrived in the sweetshop and Rina immediately ran off to check out the fudge counter.</i><br><br>Wow, they walked really fast. No wait, they probably portalled, but still need warm cloaks because they intend to leave the sweetshop and walk to the Three Broomsticks. I think this could have been made a bit clearer.<br><br><i>The Rose and Ginny headed back to the castle while Sirius and his harem went to the Glen.</i> <br>Does Rose really deserve an article, or did you mean &quot;Then&quot;?<br><br><i>It wasn’t said until they landed that the ‘strange things’ were dementors, but Rose immediately flipped out and kicked Buckbeak to make him go faster.<br><br>Rose, Lupin, and Sirius stood back-to-back in the Glen surrounded by dementors, Lupin and Sirius trying and failing to produce corporeal Patronuses.</i><br><br>Rose tried to make Buckbeak go faster, and then suddenly stood in the Glen? I would try to turn the first sentence around, somewhat like:<br><i>Rose immediately flipped out and kicked Buckbeak to make him go faster, although only when they eventually had landed it was said</i> (or &quot;she realized&quot;?) <i>that the ‘strange things’ were dementors.</i><br><br>Uhh, apparently I switched halfway into beta reader mode when I read this for the second time. (In full beta reader mode, I would also read and compare the badfic.)<br><br><i>What was the point of coming out here, other than to let Rose show off?</i><br>No criticism here, I’m just curious. What were the dementors doing there? Looking for escapee Peter Pettigrew, because for some ridiculous reason he would obviously want to return to Hogwarts? Or had the Ministry forgotten to tell them that Sirius had been pardoned?<br><br>HG</p>

One of the more sessionable ones on the list.<br><br><a href="http://www.thefoundrycanterbury.co.uk/canterbury-brewers/">Canterbury Brewers</a> are, somewhat unsurprisingly, brewers from Canterbury. They do something called Itzamna, which was originally an occasional beer but you can now get it all year round, and there&#39;s really no reason why you wouldn&#39;t. A lovely, glossy, rich stout, with biiiig chocolate and vanilla flavours, Itzamna&#39;s just a lovely thing to drink - though get a half, because it&#39;s a slow one and also 9%.<br><br><a href="http://to-ol.dk/home/hardcore-maelk/">BrewDog Hardcore Maelk</a> is a collaboration with noted Norwegian headcases To Ol (I don&#39;t know how to make the O have a line through it, sorry) that is *shuffles through notes* a black milk IPA.

I can&#39;t tell you where despite having been round the place, or possibly because I&#39;ve been round the place. Don&#39;t remember much of that particular excursion, if I&#39;m honest. Anyway, they&#39;re one of the most consistently inventive and consistently excellent brewers in the UK, and they&#39;ve never made a bad beer - which is laudable considering they&#39;ve made about three hundred different ones.<br><br><a href="http://harviestoun.com/">Harviestoun</a> are another bunch of odd Scots, but their Schiehallion is a perfect summer lager - a proper lager, not the semi-frozen can of dog urine popularly called lager by Americans and people who ought to know better.

Not that we condone that sort of behaviour at KURACS, goodness no. &lt;.&gt;.&gt;<br><br><a href="http://www.weirdbeardbrewco.com/#!/beers.html">Weird Beard</a> are weird. Presumably they also have beards. They are a craft brewery based out of somewhere in West London, so it&#39;s more than likely. Miss The Lights was an experiment of theirs, and I prefer it to the standard Hit The Lights - partly because the flavour profile meshes together a bit better in my opinion, but mostly because I am a non-conformist and probably also a filthy Commie.<br><br>Ah, <a href="http://mikkeller.dk/">Mikkeller</a>, without whom no list of interesting and/or mental beers is complete. A Danish man who wanders around like some kind of mad brilliant ale hobo, Mikkeller tries very, very hard to make the kind of beers people are excited about.

Old Freddie Walker is a wonderful winter ale, sweet as fruitcake and with a kind of prototypical Englishness about the whole thing. You drink it and you feel like you&#39;re sat in front of a log fire, the landlord knows you by name and you them, and there&#39;s a dog and some interesting books to read that you&#39;ll get round to one day but John from down the lane&#39;s dropped by and he&#39;s one for a chat, and before you know it it&#39;s a lock-in and the pints are getting cheaper and all your friends are here.<br><br>You&#39;ll forgive a little rambling, I trust. Real ale is something very close to my heart - indeed, the stuff takes up much of the space that, in normal people without cable-knit jumpers, is reserved for the liver - and I&#39;m not hugely fond of the implication that I&#39;d made up some of my personal favourites. I trust this is a suitably in-depth discussion of the drinks in question to satisfy you that they do, in fact, exist. =]<br><br>--Scapegrace,<br>Media and Merchandise Officer,<br>Kent University Real Ale and Cider Society.</p>

            <p>However, I don&#39;t always drink beer, but when I do it is not Dos Equis, because I am not the most interesting man in the world.<br><br>I am a bit more boring than that I believe.  Guinness is never a bad choice.  Abita AndyGator is also not bad.  Though I personally prefer Whiskey as my drink of choice.</p>

            <p>The mental hospital thing... um, long story short, I have firsthand experience with that, unfortunately. It wasn&#39;t fun. The day before I was going to be discharged, I got sick, fainted, and threw up. They sent me to my room for making a scene and didn&#39;t notify my parents. <br><br>I think he named it after himself. :)<br><br>There was a discussion a while ago about capitalization minis and I kind of just stopped doing it. *shrug*<br><br>Thanks for pointing those out; I&#39;ll fix those first chance. :) (And it&#39;s actually Bathsheda.

            <p>I believe this is what I supposed to be doing now that I have decided to join up with this message board.  So I suppose this is the long and short of it.<br><br>I suppose it is best to start at the beginning.  The year was, on second thought that is completely irrelevant.  I have a semi-active semi-abandoned account over at the Pit, which after seeing half the things I have seen, is more than a fitting title.  I also had a much older, which has sense mercifully been abandoned, account.  I rather hope it remains buried.  It was not a good representation of my skills.  Then again it is about a decade old...<br><br>Moving right along.  I am currently a full time student, finally nearing the end, and a part time writer.  Part time might be a bit generous, now that I mention it.  I am not certain that two chapters per six months is part time.  Graduate School has this amazing ability to cause time to just vanish, possibly into the same place that those socks always end up.<br><br>Probably worth mentioning that I am male somewhere between the ages of 1 and Gandalf.  Turning now to answer non-existent questions.  Questions that may or may not be asked.<br><br>1.  I have indeed read both the Constitution and Original Series, as well as spending several hours doing a wiki run through the wiki site.  <br><br>2.  What are my fandoms?  Well I suppose that depends on one&#39;s definition of fandom and belonging.  If the question is to which ones I write for, including the dark days, would be:  Code Lyoko, Inheritance Cycle (mercifully that story was unpublished and lost), Star Wars, and Harry Potter.  Though one of those may have been an ungodly crossover between Star Wars, Star Trek, and Code Lyoko.<br><br>If the question is more about what kind of fandoms I know about or consider myself a part of then it includes:  Star Wars, Star Trek, Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, the Inheritance Cycle, Code Lyoko, Doctor Who, Pokemon, Mass Effect, Dragon Age, Ace Combat, Bleach, Full Metal Alchemist, Hellsing, and really anything else I find moderately enjoyable and spend a few hours on the wiki.<br><br>3.  I found the PPC by doing a Wiki Run on TVTropes, I do not remember how, but eventually I got to their page on My Immortal.  Then I wound up on the PPC&#39;s page.  I do not remember all the connections.<br><br>4.  As far as PPC spin-offs and agents are concerned, I&#39;ll be honest, I have only thus far gotten through the Original Series.  So I have nothing to really judge as favorites at this point.<br><br>5.  Wait there is this thing called fun?  I must find it, Law School and fun do not really go together.  That being said, I play video games.  I occasionally read not law books, really I do.  I am not even convincing myself at this point.  I do actually read, just in limited periods of time.  I also randomly research laws for fun...That sound particularly sad when I say it now.  So let me change that I research random things.  That does not sound all that much better.  I research Fighter Jets and Super Cars.  There much better, and much less pathetic.  <br><br>So I think that is really all there is to that.  That&#39;s me in a nutshell, if an adult male could actually fit in a nutshell.</p>

Then again it was supposed to be just that.  I may have written that particular story just to troll that workshop I was in at the time.  It worked if that actually was my goal.  I do not think it was at the time, but now I realize it worked really well at trolling everyone.  Even myself.  Can one actually do that?  Troll themselves?  </p>

            <p>...the entire reason that a wave function collapses is because that our methods of observation influence the system to the point where we <i>force</i> it into a desired state. In the Schrödinger&#39;s cat experiment, it&#39;s more like opening the box with a chainsaw. You brute-force the system into two possible states: upon sawing the box open you see either a live (and traumatized) cat or a very, <i>very</i> dead cat. <br><br>Furthermore, this interpretation of quantum theory gives rise to a bunch of crackpot theories with &quot;reality is real only when you see it&quot; as a central tenet which suggests that your mind <i>somehow</i> creates and influences a reality which in turn suggests that humans are so special that they <i>make</i> reality happen by their mere presence, which is utter nonsense (and rather Suvian in principle).</p>

            <p>Well it depends on which theory of Quantum Mechanics one subscribes to.  As I understand it Schrödinger&#39;s Cat was designed to show the absurdities of the Copenhagen Interpretation.  Or in other words, something simultaneously exists in two contradictory states until observed.<br><br>But the Copenhagen Theory is not the only interpretation.  You have the Many Worlds Approach.  The observer is basically split into two separate realities running parallel with each other.  One where the cat is alive, the other where the cat is dead.<br><br>There is also the Relational Interpretation, which I am not going to even try to explain, because even the Quantum Mechanics for Dummies Page on it makes no sense to me.<br><br>Then there is the Objective Collapse Theory, which basically says once a certain threshold is met, the superpositions, i.e., living and dead cat, collapse only into one.  That single state is what would be observed when the box is open.  <br><br>Also if it is not clear, I am not a Quantum Mechanics Theorist and I may be misunderstanding it or outright making things up.  I really do not know.  But then again, maybe I actually do know Quantum Mechanics and am therefore I am in a state where I simultaneously know and do not know Quantum Mechanics.<br><br>Wait.  Did I just turn myself into Schrödinger&#39;s Cat?  I think whatever point I was trying to make is now likely invalid.</p>

            <p>...I have to admit that the Copenhagen interpretation is probably my favourite explanation of quantum effects-- even if it does have the (as you mentioned) absurd implication of the superposition of states. Consider the <a href="http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~tbrun/Course/lecture02.pdf">Stern-Gerlach</a> experiment and how the act of observing (or not observing) the system affects the final output. MIT has a very good lecture on the subject <a href="https://youtu.be/AX9769eQV24?t=40m">here</a>. Grab some popcorn; it&#39;s 40 minutes long and the prof goes through the derivations necessary to explain electron spin.<br><br>The RQM interpretation seems to be based on the special relativity notion that observers in different inertial frames measure different things for a same system. RQM doesn&#39;t concern itself with <i>how</i> the system is to the various observers. Instead, its focus is on how the system <i>appears</i> to each observer. As we say in French-- le diable est dans les détails.<br><br>Also: welcome to the Board, dude. Enjoy your stay.</p>

            <p>Though in all honesty I probably will not.  A forty minute lecture on Quantum Mechanics is not high on my list of things to do.<br><br>Also I have to say I am surprised/not surprised that in less than 24 hours I have manged to get into a discussion on Quantum Mechanics with a physicist.  Those kinds of things tend to happen to me more often than I would care to admit.</p>

            <p>Most use it to get into either news or film making. However, you can use it for HR, motivational speaking, teaching, politics, exc. Basically, if it requires a lot of talking, interpersonal or public, communications helps. However, you may be thinking, &quot;Wait a minute... Most of those require other degrees!&quot; <br><br>That&#39;s the rub. Comm is not something you want by itself. As I said, it&#39;s a piece of paper that says, &quot;I can talk to people!&quot;  That&#39;s near useless. If you want to be a tour guide or something, perhaps, but short of that, not much. However, if you have another piece of paper for another skill, you can say, &quot;I can effectively communicate, help others effectively communicate, as well as X. I can help to minimize conflict in the workplace, and if you need somebody to talk to groups large or small, I&#39;m your man. Also, I&#39;m skilled in X. Please hire me!&quot;<br><br>It&#39;s a field of study that I&#39;m not sure what I&#39;m going to do with as of yet. I am leaning towards education at the moment, but that&#39;s mostly because I&#39;m surrounded by academia. Perhaps Journalism, but I doubt it. I am not the best with deadlines, nor the fastest writer. Journalism wants the article or story out thirty minutes before it happens. That is not likely for me. My dream job would be voice acting, but that&#39;s unlikely.</p>

            <p>People love to cling onto these exceptional stories with big titles such as &quot;we&#39;re breaking physics!&quot; or &quot;we have to rethink everything!&quot;<br><br>Truth is that the standard model has never been disproven once so far. Not. Even. Once. Isn&#39;t it terribly convenient to throw out the tried-and-true model once something slightly strange is observed? We need to perform more rigorous tests on this and not give in to hype. Remember when CERN thought it had found particles moving faster than light with a certainty of five or six sigma? It was due to a calibration error-- and so is this thing. </p>

            <p>NASA is not the only one that has tested it.  China has as well though their numbers are, frankly absurd.  The Chinese test apparently produced comparable movement to standard engines.  Those numbers just do not add up, and considering everything else those numbers are incorrect, but that does not necessarily mean this was only a calibration error.  Is that possible sure.  I will not jump on the we have discovered Warp Engines any times soon.</p>

            <p>I found the <a href="http://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?R=20140006052">abstract to their research</a>.<br><br>They built two test target things: one that was designed according to the theory and another one designed so that is shouldn&#39;t move when irradiated with the radio waves.<br><br>Both moved.<br><br>They&#39;re just measuring noise, I tell you. And what the heck is this &quot;quantum virtual plasma&quot; they&#39;re referring to?! The more I read about this the more it sounds like the hollow hype surrounding the Alcubierre Drive-- the poster child of warp drive technology that people cling on to without understanding the full implications of the theory behind it-- negative mass, for one.</p>

            <p>The fact remains NASA still approved further study on it.  It still moved though.  That is the key.  What will happen on some of the other tests?  I do not know.  I agree it should not work, but there may at least be something to it.</p>

            <p>I mean if you think of it, would that not automatically damage everyone here?  Especially if they were an agent.  Look at it this way, each cannon must strictly follow its own rules, the Laws of that Cannon.  What the Agents do, from what I understand is comically restore the cannons by strictly adhering to the rules of that particular cannon.  In other words they follow a code, like a lawful character.  Now I expect most Agents are not exactly cannon in their particular divisions that they try to fix.  So then it seems most Agents would be negatively affected by the shovel.<br><br>Now I would say that on the board that would not be a problem, but we do have the Constitution we need to follow.  In other words in order to post one needs to at least be partially lawful anyways.<br><br>Or alternatively I could just smack myself in the face with the shovel for over thinking it. </p>

Yes I said it, I actually did not hate ME3&#39;s ending originally.  That alone might already prove I am crazy.  I also not only enjoyed DA2, but also liked parts of it more than Origins.  </p>

That was a strange story that is best to remain buried.<br><br>Also thanks.  A teleporting One Ring what could possibly go wrong?</p>

            <p>The real question is it a regular State Alchemist&#39;s Watch or is it of the sealed variety?  No matter, if it is sealed it will still make a nice paper weight.  And if it is not sealed, I am of the opinion that a man can never have too many watches.  Thank you kindly.</p>

            <p>I found an LOTR badfic that&#39;s making me want to tear my hair out.<br><br>There&#39;s a unicorn (a creature who does not exist in Middle Earth) who&#39;s a pet of the Sue. But wait, it&#39;s not just a unicorn. It&#39;s an ALICORN. For those of you who don&#39;t know the meaning, it&#39;s a term from My Little Pony for a cross between a pegasus and a unicorn. And not only that, this alicorn can look just like a normal black horse if he wants to, so he&#39;s always called a horse. And it belonged to Sauron, but somehow only the Sue can tame him, and he&#39;s got superpowers. And although he was Sauron&#39;s pet, he&#39;s not evil!<br><br>That&#39;s just one of the major problems.</p>

            <p>If and when you <i>do</i> get Permission, that won&#39;t mean you&#39;ve &#39;completed&#39; your socialising and can now stop.

            <p>The first thing you see on the Board says nothing about the Unclaimed Badfic list. We give nine links: TOS, the <i>Killed</i> Badfic list, and the Complete List (for missions to read); the IRC, Constitution, and Wiki; and three FAQs.<br><br>But yes, the Wiki feels like it&#39;s all about the missions, for a very good reason: it&#39;s primarily a wiki of the <i>shared universe</i>, not the community. We&#39;ve used it to host community stuff - the FAQs, articles about Permission, etc etc - but in its original conception and primary use, it&#39;s a resource for &#39;wasn&#39;t there an agent in Floaters who did something like this once?&#39; and &#39;who else has written about Admiral Pansy?&#39;. It&#39;s not - no, it <i>wasn&#39;t</i> intended to be the public face of the PPC, though it&#39;s fairly clearly become such.<br><br>As to wanting to write missions... why not write something <i>else</i>? Heck, why not write something else with your prospective agents - before they joined the PPC, or in an AU where they never did? Fleshing out their characters, even if you never show anyone, is always worthwhile.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>You can use characters you designed as agents for the PPC however you want - they&#39;re <i>your</i> characters. You can&#39;t use them for PPC missions yet, because you don&#39;t have permission, but other than that? It is, as they say, your party.<br><br>In fact, I&#39;d encourage it. I recall coming up with the Notary for use in one of the Board&#39;s RPs (Gallifrey Bickers, a transcript of which is availabubble <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GzRQYiu9gJhIml3Hje_ubJM_AHMk3a1AdC5VP5dSp9w/pub">here</a>), and she&#39;s actually grown into one of the more popular ones to use around here. It&#39;s not often people get to write for someone that genuinely awful, after all. Because I used her in a variety of interesting ways, I actually got a lot better as a writer - to the point where I felt able to give her a proper tragic backstory that features <i>no tragedy at all</i>, something of a feat.

            <p>Despite what my activity probably seems to say, missions aren&#39;t the only thing about the PPC. We&#39;re here to celebrate fandoms and have fun! If you focus just on getting Permission, you&#39;re not just missing the point, but a lot of fun stuff, too. Heck, most people only write one or two missions and stop. Don&#39;t worry so much about Permission and hang out! Talk, share stories, opinions, get to know people. There&#39;s a lot of cool stuff going on here. :)</p>

            <p>At least those used to be one of the most common sites.

            <p>From what I&#39;ve seen, most authors either link to a Google Document or use a specific web page for their missions. <br><br>However... It seems a bit early for you to be considering missions. You&#39;ll need Permission first (you&#39;ve read what is needed for that, yes?), and one of the requirements for that is time. Wait a bit, let us get to know you more in the community, and then submit your characters and writing prompts once they are ready. </p>

            <p>hS and I use free webhosting services—<a href="http://www.webs.com/">Webs</a> and <a href="http://www.tripod.lycos.com/">Tripod</a>, respectively. They give you a certain amount of storage, and you can build whatever kind of site you want (within their TOS). You don&#39;t even have to know HTML/CSS to take advantage of them these days, since they provide WYSIWYG sitebuilding services. I don&#39;t like those, personally, because I find them restricting, but that&#39;s not to say they aren&#39;t great for other people.<br><br>However, Webs has repeatedly proven to be THE WORST in terms of pages/sites randomly going down for dubious reasons (note that hS stores most of his actual stories on GDocs now), so I&#39;d recommend Tripod more than ever. They do put obnoxious ads on your pages, but since just about everyone uses AdBlocker or the like these days, it&#39;s not that big of a problem. Also, the only trouble I&#39;ve ever had from them in over ten years is one instance of the Lost Tales site going down because of an alleged TOS violation on one page, and the issue was easily resolved. Their customer service was very helpful.<br><br>There are others, too—I think Google has one—but I&#39;m not familiar with them. Like I said, I&#39;ve been with Tripod for ten years, no complaints.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve been a member of that since 2011/12, but I&#39;m afraid a mission could get taken down... Then again, all the forbidden things that site says not to write almost never gets taken down. Like the expressly forebidden M-rated fics, which I see on the archives all the time. It&#39;s sad.</p>

            <p>We had that problem very often in the past - probably because the authors of the sporked fics tend to discover them more easily and so report the PPCer.<br><br>Why fics with graphic, badly written sex stay on the site despite being clearly against the rules while the sporking of these gets taken down for a &quot;gray area&quot; offense is a question that is probably best left unanswered.</p>

            <p>As has been mentioned, <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10727893/1/PPC-Driftwood">PPC: Driftwood</a> has been sitting there quite happily for half a year now. I&#39;m actually in favour of posting PPC stories where people can stumble across them, because otherwise we won&#39;t get any new members - that&#39;s pretty much what TVTropes has done, in fact.<br><br>But. But I keep every <i>Driftwood</i> mission hosted entirely separately on <a href="http://huinesoron.webs.com/PPC/Agents.htm">my site</a> (as Google Docs linked from a Webs.com page). But I&#39;ve deliberately written <i>Driftwood</i> to be much &#39;kinder&#39; than the typical PPC mission - check out &#39;Agent Kaitlyn&#39;s Concrit&#39; at the end of each chapter. But... well, honestly, but if you antagonise FF.net readers, the lashback might hit missions other than yours.<br><br>So yeah. It depends.<br><br>hS</p>

So, join me for a pint, wear your brightest green, and tell us all what you are doing this St. Paddy&#39;s day!<br><br>~ World-Jumper <img src="http://icons.iconarchive.com/icons/iconka/st-patricks-day/24/shamrock-icon.png" alt="http://icons.iconarchive.com/icons/iconka/st-patricks-day/24/shamrock-icon.png"> </p>

            <p>Yesterday I walked around a picket line to get to my first resumed class, and I did not wear any green.<br><br>We were looking at aurorae, though, and those have a lot of green. Also, the snow&#39;s melting, so we have tiny bits of new green showing up. Not much yet, though.<br><br>But apart from seeing other people&#39;s photos on Facebook, I didn&#39;t do a thing. S&#39;pose I could have sung an Irish drinking song (I&#39;m very amused by the fact that I drink very little but love drinking songs) or gone to the subway station (green, of course) named St. Patrick, but...it didn&#39;t really occur to me.<br><br>I am very amused by your post(s), though.<br><br>~DF</p>

            <p>Well, I didn&#39;t do anything special today. College students don&#39;t exactly go around pinching people anymore. *shrug* I did wear a green T-shirt, though.

            <p>Oh, boy-o, I can tell ye, the stereotyping can get even thicker, iffen I wanted to. Why, I&#39;m practically prancin&#39; round the clover patch, singing &quot;Danny Boy&quot; at the top o&#39; me lungs! Oh, relax there, me boy, I won&#39;t be bringing any leprechauns into this.

I love that island, and everything about it.<br><br>Also, in real life, I have developed a <i>mean</i> Irish accent. My Scottish ain&#39;t too bad either, though it could use some fine-tuning. At the moment, I sound only slightly better then Mel Gibson. Ah well.</p>

            <p>Phobos and I (not to mention the entire city of Chicago) got started a bit early. My choir sang some Irish tunes on Sunday, we cooked up a big pot of corned beef, potatoes, and Brussels sprouts yesterday, we&#39;re making the leftovers into Ruben sandwiches today, and I&#39;ve been listening to my favorite Celtic music since the weather turned spring-like a few days ago. I have plenty of green in my wardrobe, so that&#39;s gotten some airing, and I also have this pretty moss stone Celtic cross necklace (which I wear because it is green and Celtic, not because it&#39;s a cross, lest anyone be misled).<br><br>No pints for me, thanks, but <i>slàinte</i> to you anyway. {= )<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>And by that I mean the PPC story takedowns. I&#39;ve heard they&#39;re pretty bad. And I may have a solution. I might be able to set up a website dedicated entirely to hosting PPC stories. It would take a bit of effort, but it is by no means impossible.<br><br>If this sounds like a good idea, let me know so I can get started. If not, then I get a few more computers to rant online with. I know that a lot of people host things on Google Drive, but I thought a dedicated site might work a bit better.</p>

            <p>Most takedowns are <i>not</i> irate authors complaining to web hosts. That happened to me once (or maybe twice), and obviously happened to Jay and Acacia; for the most part, though, it&#39;s pretty rare.<br><br>Most missions vanish because their hosts just drop them. We lost a lot in the fall of Geocities; we&#39;re losing a fair bit now because Webs.com have been having a cleanout.<br><br>And... well, we already <i>have</i> an archive for those old missions which are under threat. <a href="http://plotprotectors.tripod.com/">PPC: The Lost Tales</a>, run by Neshomeh. For that matter, I&#39;ve rehosted a few myself, and I know others have as well.<br><br>And finally... uh, you&#39;re very new. I&#39;d love to think you&#39;re going to stick around for decades to come, but there&#39;s only a handful of people here who&#39;ve made it through the <i>last</i> decade. So if one person sets themselves up as the host for all PPC works, what that&#39;s likely to mean is that we lose <i>everything</i> when they let the site lapse.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Since I am not eligible to do missions yet, so I do not know, I do think that when you have a large shared universe, putting it all in one place makes it a lot easier for readers to find.  So from that angle it makes some good sense.<br><br>Also if you want help creating the site I would be willing to pitch in.  I am by no means a web designer, but I am not unfamiliar with HTML, PHP, or CASS.  I would need to do a substantial bit of refreshing in all of those, but I can do that.<br><br>As it was I had planned on setting up my own website for both my original fiction, since I have gotten tired of shopping it around to magazines, and my own PPC when I do get permission.</p>

            <p>Thanks, but for now, I&#39;m just trying to set my Raspberry Pi up to host. Once that&#39;s done, I&#39;ll start collecting ideas for this, like where to put all the nifty buttons.

            <p>&quot;One Day at Freddy&#39;s&quot; (unbetaed)<br><br>Doc sat stiffly on the undersized kid&#39;s bench.  &quot;This just feels so inappropriate.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Lighten up, Doc!  It&#39;s a  birthday party.&quot;  Vania took a noisy sip of soda.  &quot;You realize how rarely kids in our Nursery get to do normal stuff like this?  Look at them!&quot;<br><br>Mollie and Ollie, now officially eleven-year-olds, had invited some of their friends to the party.  The kids were laughing and yelling, running back and forth from the arcade games to the table that held the pizza.<br><br>&quot;Yeah, but . . .&quot; Doc turned his gaze to the singing animatronics on the colorful stage.  &quot;Why <i>here</i>?&quot;<br><br>Vania&#39;s face turned deadly serious, and she moved it slowly closer to Doc&#39;s until she was eye to eye.  &quot;Have you any idea?&quot;  She paused dramatically.  &quot;How much these parties cost in a real-world Chuck E. Cheese&#39;s?&quot;  She grinned.<br><br>Doc glared at her.  &quot;You know what I mean.&quot;  He motioned towards the stage with his shoulder.  &quot;Those <i>things</i> kill people,&quot; he whispered.<br><br>&quot;Doc, you of all people ought to do the research before making assumptions.  Everything is fine.&quot;  She lowered her voice.  &quot;The biting incident happens in 1987, and the  kidnapping in an unknown June.  We are safely in March of 1985, and have nothing to worry about but the grease content in this pizza.&quot;<br><br>Doc looked again at the jerkily dancing robots on the stage.  &quot;What if the kids play this when they get older, and it gives them nightmares that they were here?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Already done it.&quot;<br><br>Doc whipped his head towards the boy who had spoken.  &quot;Seriously?&quot;<br><br>Chuck grinned around his mouthful of pizza, then swallowed.  &quot;Well?  Keep your glazzies in your gullivers, it&#39;s just a bit of fun.&quot;<br><br>Doc sneered a bit.  &quot;Ugh.  Why am I not surprised the <i>Clockwork Orange</i> kid has played <i>Five Nights</i>?&quot;<br><br>Vania smacked him on the arm.  &quot;Doc!  That&#39;s rude!&quot;<br><br>Chuck gave an even bigger grin.  &quot;Oh, and is the poogly Floater afraid of the creepy dannies?  Ha ha ha!&quot;<br><br>&quot;I think Freddy is the scariest!&quot; A girl chimed in.<br><br>&quot;No way, it&#39;s Foxy!&quot; Mollie added.<br><br>&quot;I find Balloon Boy unsettling,&quot; said another child (who happened to be a robot wearing a human disguise for the party).<br><br>The agents listened to the mounting debate in stunned silence.  Finally, Vania interrupted the kids with a, &quot;Guys, guys!  Keep your voices down!  Don&#39;t let any of the background canons hear a spoiler.&quot;<br><br>The kids hushed quickly, allowing Doc to quietly ask, &quot;They let you play this crap in the Nursery?&quot;<br><br>&quot;It&#39;s fun!&quot;<br><br>&quot;We take turns!&quot;<br><br>&quot;I&#39;ve gotten to night six in the first one!&quot;<br><br>&quot;I got all the way through the first two games!&quot;<br><br>&quot;I&#39;ve found all the Easter eggs!&quot;<br><br>As the kids began clamoring again, Doc and Vania folded their arms and laid their heads down.<br><br>&quot;Sorry,&quot; Doc said.  &quot;I guess I was being over-protective.&quot;<br><br>&quot;S&#39;all right, Doc.  I . . . wasn&#39;t expecting the kids to be <i>quite</i> this resilient.  At least we know we&#39;re safe, with all these canon experts at hand!&quot;<br><br>Doc smiled.  &quot;True!&quot;<br><br>Then, a spotlight fell from the ceiling and crashed to the ground right behind them.<br><br>—doctorlit, who proposes the animatronics&#39; AIs were corrupted when the facial recognition software viewed Agent Doc&#39;s face, and couldn&#39;t properly cope with the ugly.</p>

            <p>Just to be clear, my idea for this character is that she thought this had something to do with Middle-earth. She has never read or probably even heard of <i>Ranger&#39;s Apprentice</i>. She probably got the application by posting a LotR story in the wrong section of FF.net, because her character <i>is</i> a Ranger&#39;s apprentice... just not the right sort. She&#39;ll be in for a nasty shock when she realizes she has zero chance of meeting Aragorn—unless you&#39;re planning a crossover chapter to cover the differences between types of fantasy Ranger. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if people mix them up, deliberately or otherwise.<br><br>... And if you <i>do</i> do that, you can borrow Nurse Mirrad to talk about <i>Babylon 5</i>&#39;s sci-fi Rangers, iff&#39;n you like. I might be the only one who would find that amusing, though. ^_^;<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I just had to look. I&#39;m a little stupid like that, I guess. And I found this: <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9112645/1/A-Journey-Across-Two-Lands">&quot;A Journey Across Two Lands&quot;</a> by Direwolfgirl and flipy010, a LotR x RA crossover. Or so it says. I dunno where the RA characters end up, but it sure doesn&#39;t sound like Middle-earth to me. O.o I can&#39;t judge the RA portions, since I haven&#39;t read the series, but if they&#39;re as messed up as the LotR stuff, then all I can say is YIKES. What&#39;s your take on it?<br><br>~Neshomeh, morbidly curious.</p>

Lemme vomit up my thoughts.<br><br>So, the story starts off in Araluen, but the wonky characterization happens almost immediately. Will and Alyss is a canon pairing, but shortly after they were married, Alyss died in a fire. Charlotte/Charlie is an OC and I&#39;m finding her obnoxious. Then Will getting all worried about Halt- understandable? Yes, but for god&#39;s sake, the Rangers go off on secret missions all the time! But no, he just has that stupid &#39;gut instinct&#39; that nobody actually has. Oy vey.<br><br>Mirabelle? WTF? Horace and Cassandra had one daughter, Madelyn. Where the heck did this Mirabelle come from? (Yes, yes, it&#39;s a stupid question and I don&#39;t care UGH.)<br><br>The fact that the girls refer to Halt as &#39;Grandpa Halt&#39; is... I mean, I could see them having that sentiment since Halt basically became a father figure to Will, but I really doubt he&#39;d put up with being called &#39;Grandpa&#39;. Getting a very definite Sue vibe from those two girls. <br><br>And who are Vereor and Venatora? Don&#39;t tell me they&#39;re Legolas&#39; wife and kid oh god whyyyy<br><br><i>Will nudged Tug forward, scanning the ground for any prints.

He tried to slow Tug down, but it was too late and he found himself tumbling down into the dark waters below.</i> RANGER HORSES ARE VERY HIGHLY TRAINED WHY DID ONE JUST RUN OFF A CLIFF BAD TUG REPLACEMENT BAD BAD BAD<br><br>...Halt was taken by Orcs. Unless there were like a hundred of them Halt could beat them. Seriously. What.<br><br>I can&#39;t read this.

The frickin&#39; Sue is able to ride and tame him without the code word. Ranger horses are trained to buck off anyone who doesn&#39;t tell them a special code word, and she tamed him.

            <p>So I saw an interesting thread on Reddit, and I thought it might be fun to have on here as well. The basic premise is this: create a superhero or supervillain. List their powers and goals, plus maybe a short backstory or list of motives if you&#39;d like. The next person to post will create a nemesis for that hero or villain, with all appropriate information on why they are a nemesis. Feel free to make a new hero/villain for the next person to do as well. <br>Here&#39;s an example:<br><br>VILLAIN: Quarry<br>POWERS: Basically an Earthbender.<br>Motive: He likes minerals and rare metals. A lot. His main targets are jewelry stores and treasuries for precisely this reason.<br><br>NEMESIS: The Paperboy (Hero)<br>POWERS: The ability to control paper. Skilled in origami.<br>Backstory: Bob Brickman was a journalist tired of writing depressing stories about his city. One day, he got hit by a radioactive paper airplane. Now he fights crime as The Paperboy, in the hopes that he will be able to write more uplifting stories about his alter ego.<br>NEMESIS STATUS: Well, duh. Paper beats rock!<br><br>So, to start things off...<br>VILLAIN: The Pun-isher.<br>POWERS: He knows the worst puns ever created, and uses gadgets themed in horrible, cringe-y ways.<br>Motive: He takes hostages. After that, he subjects them to increasingly-worse puns until they pay the ransom.</p>

            <p><b><i>NEMESIS: Earworm (Master 4-7)</i><br>POWERS:</b> Induces potent auditory hallucinations. Generally, they take the form of catchy modern pop songs, but other noises are available.<br><b>BACKSTORY:</b> A deaf, orphaned girl who has been thoroughly institutionalised by years in the ever-ironically-named care system, Ellie Reed eventually taught herself to &quot;feel&quot; music via the vibrations from speakers. She now goes around as Earworm, wanting to spread this newfound joy to everyone she meets.<br><b>NEMESIS STATUS:</b> If you can&#39;t hear the puns, you can&#39;t be hurt by the puns.<br><br><b><i>VILLAIN: Backlash (Primary Striker 6, Secondary Mover and Master ratings)</i><br>POWERS:</b> Point-blank telekinesis, the reach of which is extended by handheld items (though not bullets fired from a gun, for instance). Carries a bullwhip for precisely this reason and not because she really, really has a thing for Indiana Jones why do people keep asking thaaaat?<br><b>Motive:</b> Oh, so you think it belongs in a museum, do ya? Well, this girl begs to differ.</p>

            <p>Nemesis: Twitch<br>Powers: Super speed, enhanced senses, being fused with a sentient AI occasionally helps as well. <br>Backstory: From the future, Twitch has come back to preserve more things so that the people in his future have more of an idea about the history of earth than they currently have (which is to say, not much). Having been fused with Sasha, one of the first fully sentient AI&#39;s in the future, by the government before he was sent into the past, Twitch has a full list of things he must try and preserve for the future, even if some of them seem slightly obscene (that incident with the Empire State Building and a giant case is generally not mentioned). Whilst he seems to talk to himself quite a lot, it is in fact Twitch having conversations with Sasha, although only he can hear her responses. Twitch has a thing for earth&#39;s culture, especially movies, and no he does not have Sasha play the theme of Indiana Jones in his head every time he goes into a fight thank you very much, that was just something he made up when he had too much cider (one of the many things they don&#39;t have in the future). Named Twitch because it seems like he never stays still for long periods of time.<br>Nemesis status: wants to put stuff in museums and totally does not have anything to do with Indiana Jones whatsoever.<br><br><br>Hero: Templar<br>Powers: Can transfer light, sound, heat and kinetic energy from anything (or anyone) he is touching to anything else (or anyone) he (or it) is touching, or to himself.<br>Goals: To defeat villains, to uphold the values of the church and to fight for peace and justice.</p>

            <p><b><i>NEMESIS: Pandemonium (Shaker 8, Thinker 3)</i><br>POWERS:</b> The ability to create what she calls a &quot;Limbo Zone&quot; - an area of land where there is nothing. No light, no warmth, just darkness and silence. The introduction of energy into this system, beginning by just walking into the place, begins to twist it into a nightmarish hellscape, the details of which change every time according to the subconscious fears of those imparting energy.<br><b>BACKSTORY:</b> Growing up in an extremely Catholic household in a rural Irish village, the young priest&#39;s daughter was a lonely child, strange and isolated, often off in her own world. She sought escape, you see; escape from the endless violent acts and indignities her parents inflicted on her to &quot;proof her against the sin of the world&quot;. While she was eventually adopted (amid a national scandal), she still harbours the bitterest loathing for the Christian God and his faithful, and frequently goes out of her way to attack churches with her power.<br><b>NEMESIS STATUS:</b> Both ideologically and in terms of power, she is antithetical to Templar, a hero she doesn&#39;t consider to be a true hero at all.<br><br><b><i>VILLAIN: Silica (Blaster 8, Brute 5)</i><br>POWERS:</b> The creation of a... well, force field is the wrong word. Or words, as the case may be. He is able to create an area of intense heat and pressure extending about a foot from his body (at maximum), which he generally uses to form constructs out of what basically amounts to volcanic glass. Spears, shields, sculpture, as long as it&#39;s a fairly simple shape he can make it. It also renders him rather effective at tanking shots; anything up to 40K-style Bolter rounds gets melted down by his field before it can touch him, and he&#39;s obviously not fazed by flamethrowers.<br><b>MOTIVE:</b> A former abstract sculptor from the West Midlands, Silica worked in glass and had an exhibit at the Tate Modern gallery - an exhibit that was entirely destroyed during a superpowered fight between two groups who both purported to be heroes. When he exhibited a similar collection at Tate St. Ives, it was smashed to pieces by a self-professed heroine with poor control over her powers unleashing a storm of gravitational anomalies all over the shop and accidentally levelling the museum. When he exhibited again... you get the idea. Now he works as a professional herokiller, and if you can afford his rates, Silica will stop at nothing to make sure your target dies as horribly and slowly as possible. And with superheated glass and an artist&#39;s imagination, that&#39;s not the kind of fate you want.</p>

            <p>Man, I need to finish reading that lovely series. Have you seen the Weaver Dice Rules?<br><br>NEMESIS: Crackdown (Breaker, Shaker, levels I have not pondered)<br>Powers: Crackdown&#39;s powers are fairly simple. Crackdown can create a &#39;frailty field&#39;, where any large inorganic objects within become extremely delicate and prone to breaking apart. The exact amount of breakage depends on how strong the structure is to begin with, and how much Crackdown is focusing on it, but in general most objects can be shattered to bits by a touch.<br>Motive: Crackdown was a former practical-effects guy for movies, with a particular talent in buildings falling apart in explosions, Load-Bearing-Boss situations, and other such circumstances. However, when an earthquake struck as a result of a cape battle, Crackdown triggered and gained their powers. Upon seeing the damage that battles could do, Crackdown resolved to use their powers to help keep the collateral damage of battles to a minimum (along with beating up villains.)<br>Nemesis Status: Crackdown understands, to some extent, why Silica is upset, but thinks that he went too far in his grudge, considering that he&#39;s upset over accidents.<br><br><br>HERO: Sparkler (Striker 5)<br>POWERS: Sparkler&#39;s power is very very basic. She can, by touching objects, cause them to suddenly give off energy in the form of light, heat, or sound, or multiple at once. Essentially, she can grab a rock and turn it into a flashbang. Due to the Manton Effect, she can&#39;t do this to anything living, though.<br>MOTIVE: Sparkler just wants to be a classic hero, righting wrongs and doing good. Her powers require some finesse to be nonlethal, but she does her best with materials to keep things safe. <br><br>((yeah I&#39;m not very good at motives/backstory today, hrm.))</p>

            <p>To the point where I infected Iximaz (and technically Darkotas, if only by proxy). Tt = best fox. =]<br><br>And as for you, <i>Sparkler</i>...<br><br>(aside from the obvious being Grue, or Fog, or Clockblocker, or any teek...)<br><br><b><i>NEMESIS: Redline (Trump 6)</i><br>POWERS:</b> Redline describes his power as &quot;dangerous escalation&quot;. He is able to greatly enhance the powers of multiple capes, but at great cost to the capes themselves. Typically this implies removing invulnerabilities to effects they create - a fire-hurling Blaster becoming easily burned, a Mover with super-speed becoming affected by the friction of air resistance, and so on.<br><b>BACKSTORY:</b> A thrill-seeker and former low-level wrestler, DeShawn Elliott triggered when a hardcore fight went dangerously out of control and a neo-Nazi proceeded to be the tar out of him. Desperate and fearing for his life, he reached out and tapped into the essence of the guy&#39;s power, knowing he could hold out a little longer if he just dodged. The man, later discovered to be the notorious cape Stormfront (not to be confused with Stormtiger, who was on the Eastern Seaboard at the time), seemed to grow and swell with each passing second, until the strain on his internal organs basically gave him a case of Important-Bits-Blowing-Up-But-Good.<br><b>NEMESIS STATUS:</b> Honestly? He plays it off as trying to help, but really he thinks she&#39;s a liability, a bad cape in a worse part of town trying and failing to be the hero she thinks she is. His power is extremely dangerous, especially for a Striker like Sparkler. Her objects often blow up in her hands when he&#39;s around and the effect makes it harder for her to control the detonation. The other capes on Sparkler&#39;s team have a habit of neglecting to mention that he&#39;s there... possibly because she sings Disney songs at three in the morning when Targeter&#39;s just trying to get some darn <i>sleep</i>-<br><br>Ahem.</p>

            <p>NEMESIS (sort of): Nightshade (Master, Thinker)<br>Powers: True to his name, Nightshade can cut off any sources of light in an area, which allows him to operate in total darkness. This is useful for confusing enemies, covering escapes, preparing ambushes, etc. He can also melt into shadows and phase through walls as well, the better to sneak up on people.<br>Motive: Nightshade isn&#39;t so much of a villain as an anti-hero. He&#39;s neutral at best and has noble motives, but his moral compass don&#39;t exactly point north. He isn&#39;t afraid to stoop to the same level as those he fights in order to achieve the goal he wants, and he often doesn&#39;t care about the collateral harm he causes. If he&#39;s thrown innocent civilians under the bus in his bid to get rid of his enemy, he considers it their problem. Those he genuinely cares about, though, are an exception, and he tries to protect them as much as he can.<br>Relationship: Sparkler started out as one of those annoyances whom Nightshade wanted out of his way. After she inadvertently interfered with his conflicts one time too many, though, he developed a special feeling for her. His relationship with her is a love-hate one and while he wants her out of the picture, he also respects her innocence and unwillingness to do harm to others. It&#39;s quite possible that Sparkler may be the key to helping Nightshade truly understand the hidden goodness in himself.<br><br>VILLAIN: Seraphim (Blaster, Changer)<br>Powers: Telekinesis, energy manipulation, six razor-sharp wings, and the ability to get people to believe in anything he says.<br>Motive: ​Seraphim was a religious fanatic who gained his twisted powers through a prayer ritual gone horribly wrong. He believes in young-Earth creationism and has deep, inherent misunderstandings of the Bible&#39;s teachings. His homophobia, racism, and hatefulness of anyone who isn&#39;t &quot;pure&quot; are literally infectious, and anyone in existence could be a target for his misguided wrath and he isn&#39;t averse to wiping out entire populations for just <i>being there.</i> he hopes to gain a large enough following to make world bow to the ideals he claims to bring.</p>

            <p>Though, how is Nightshade a Master? I don&#39;t see any control-type powers. Also I think the love-hate thing is rather cute, so. <br><br>NEMESIS: Lampad (Striker, Master)<br>Powers: Lampad&#39;s main power is to create a &#39;torch&#39; - typically a metal staff, but any object that she can hold in her hands and focus on for a certain period of time will do. The torch will then glow with an otherworldly fire, and seeing it will cause mental effects on the viewer, though the specific ones vary - courage can be grown in her allies, or fear and panic in her enemies, or similar. The other power is that the torch can be used as a sort of laser-blaster.<br>Motive: Lampad was an activist for a variety of causes - LGBT rights, disability rights, anti-police-brutality, all sorts of things. Now, she uses her powers to fight for justice, and uses her credibility from villain-fighting to work for social change. Naturally, she considers Seraphim to be morally repugnant.<br><br>Villain: Itzli (Tinker)<br>Powers: Itzli&#39;s tinker ability has become focused into the creation of very sharp things. Laser blades, drills that carve straight through incredibly tough materials, scalpels that can cut into super-tough skin - all fall under her purviews.<br>Motive: Itzli, as with many Tinkers, loves to make and test her inventions. Unfortunately, she has very little qualms about who gets her inventions, and so often sells to villains, and she&#39;s not averse to robbing banks when her sales are low.</p>

            <p><b><i>NEMESIS: Eye (Blaster 5, Striker 5)</i><br>POWERS:</b> Eye is the central point of a potent telekinetic storm that she can turn on and off at will, able to use it to create howling gales, localized tornadoes, and generally hurl objects around. The Striker element to the power is more interesting; she&#39;s able to transfer a portion of her consciousness to that object, creating multiple storm centres. She can&#39;t use it on living creatures, though. Curse that Manton limitation.<br><b>NEMESIS STATUS:</b> As a nihilistic anarchist (translation: she owns a Dead Kennedys T-shirt and precisely zero works by Bakunin), Teri Yates is vehemently opposed to all laws regarding criminality and, indeed, anything else. As such, she&#39;s more of a nuisance supervillain than anything else, and her Revolution is mostly composed of similarly disaffected suburban teenagers with sod-all else to do of a weekend.<br><br><b><i>HERO: Dimac (Brute 6, Striker 8, Changer 4-5)</i><br>POWERS:</b> Dimac has the ability to transfer her fatigue and physical injuries to an opponent, which - given her Brute rating means she treats anti-tank rounds the way one might treat pigeon poo - means she can incapacitate someone quite easily. On people with kill orders, though? It can very definitely be lethal. The Changer rating really only refers to her regenerative talents.<br><b>BACKSTORY:</b> Corrine Fairbright was a talented martial artist before being diagnosed with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. Upon the condition worsening, she was contemplating suicide and nearly did the deed when she triggered. Now, though, she&#39;s just glad to have her body in working order, after a fashion, and she loves her work as an enforcer who can keep other Brute-rated capes down in time for the containment specialists to show up.<br><b>GOALS:</b> To make sure that the bad guys stay down.</p>

            <p><b>Pick your Poison</b><br><br>Okay, I tried to skim the pit, looking for blurbs that catch my eye. But I found that I have neither the time, nor the patience, to do this. So here is a question for all you gals and guys who post in badfic threads. How do you find this stuff? Do you stumble over it by chance, because you read just so many fanfiction? Are there some filter tricks for finding badfiction?<br><br>I may be able to recognize badfiction when I see it, but considering that I don’t really like to read fanfiction much, I will probably never find bad fanfiction unless it pokes me in the eye or something. So, to make this going, I checked the preselected badfiction on the Unclaimed Badfic page, <i>Harry Potter</i> division.<br><br>&quot;Becoming Female&quot;: 55 chapters, although short, are probably too much for a workshop.<br><br>&quot;Christmas Cuppa&quot;: Short, but eek, not my kink; and Androia is predestined to be an assassin.<br><br>&quot;Harry Potter and the Gift of the Basilisk&quot;: Looks interesting but is nearly as long as &quot;Becoming Female&quot;.<br><br>&quot;Ival Pythonica&quot;: Definitely too long for a workshop (113.706 words).<br><br>&quot;The Last War&quot;: <i>Harry and Hermione soon find themselves wondering what they ever saw in the Weasleys. But will they finally recognize their love for one another? And what devastating consequences will happen when they do? H/Hr Don&#39;t like it? DON&#39;T READ IT.</i> <br>I may follow this advice; this thing makes me too angry.<br><br>&quot;The Love of Severus Snape&quot;: Marauder era? Another twenty-thousand words fic, probably too long.<br><br>&quot;My Boys&quot;: After a quick skim through I’m not sure whether I can do much with this, but at least it’s short, and there may be some fun to have with the flashbacks.<br><br>&quot;Potter and Riddle&quot;: Looks like a great waste of good ideas. I would like to do something with it, but I don’t dare to touch it. Not until I have improved my skills.<br><br>&quot;The Real Us&quot;: Definitely too long for a workshop (157.527 words)<br><br>&quot;Rose&#39;s Visit&quot;: This may be a &quot;short and easy&quot; first mission for my agents, if I can convince them that Rose is a Replacement and a Matchmaker Sue. But with only one chapter it may be too short for the purpose of this workshop. <br><br>&quot;Someone To Love Me&quot;: Another one I would like to do something with, but for the time being it may be too &quot;complex&quot; for me.<br><br><br>So I’m going to thoroughly read &quot;My Boys&quot;, &quot;Rose&#39;s Visit&quot; and, if neither of them fits, &quot;Harry Potter and the Gift of the Basilisk&quot; and &quot;The Love of Severus Snape&quot;, and I will try to come back with an outline for at least one of them. But this may take some days.<br><br>HG</p>

            <p>Well, it&#39;s usually not that hard to find, since it&#39;s all over the place, but here are some things I sometimes do.<br><br>I usually start by setting the filters to search for English fics, and to search for OCs under the Romance genre. And if I&#39;m in the mood for specific characters, I search for those as well. <br><br>Or, in the &#39;Search Fanfic&#39; bar, I type in a few keywords, like &#39;daughter Remus Tonks&#39; or &#39;transfer student Hogwarts&#39;. You know, generic badfic story premises. Suethors are surprisingly uncreative with their summaries.<br><br>From there, I just kind of browse through the selections (usually with the TV on in the background for something interesting to occupy me) and look for summaries that make me want to bang my head against the wall. If I find one that looks promising, I&#39;ll read through the first three or so chapters. If I like (or, I guess, don&#39;t like) what I see, I keep reading. And if it looks mission-worthy, I copy the link to the first chapter into my phone&#39;s notes.<br><br>There you have it. :)</p>

            <p>I like to make my notes directly on the badfic, either in Gdocs or a hard copy if it&#39;s not too long, but otherwise it seems we work in much the same way. I&#39;m more pro-cutting off the badfic early, though, it sounds like. With anything above two or three chapters, it&#39;s practically necessary unless you want all your missions to be novels. Mine have gotten long enough as it is.<br><br>Plus, there&#39;s the fine art of picking your kill point to consider. Unless the fic is really mediocre, chances are you/your agents will have worked up plenty of enthusiasm for taking it down long before the end, and forcing the story to go on risks losing that energy, which is bad.<br><br>One piece of nitpickery for you—a bit of redundant phrasing here:<br><br><i>Blurbs are <u>a good place to start</u>. Obviously they can&#39;t tell you anything, but if you see misspelled words or ridiculous scenarios touched upon in the summary, that&#39;s obviously <u>a good place to start</u>.</i><br><br>Oh, and you probably meant &quot;everything,&quot; not &quot;anything.&quot; I actually hadn&#39;t noticed that until I looked at the passage out of context.<br><br>I look forward to the next part!<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I&#39;ll correct those ASAP.<br><br>That&#39;s a good point about considering where to cut off the story. I am admittedly approaching mission writing from a different perspective, as most of the badfics I&#39;ve previously chosen to spork have not been particularly long. I chose shorter badfic in part to avoid the enthusiasm decline that you mentioned. I&#39;ll consider that while working on the mission-writing workshop.<br><br>PC</p>

            <p>I remember reading a few fanfics a while ago. Both of them were supposedly parody-suefics, but one of them seemed to just be a normal suefic. The other was pretty funny, but I&#39;m still wondering if anyone has sporked a parody-suefic yet. I&#39;d love to read it if the original fic was any good. Also, what is your opinion of parody sues? I&#39;ve found that the suethor just says &quot;0h noez, it was jsut a pardy all alog!&quot; after everyone says it was a terrible read, so I don&#39;t expect much from parody sues.</p>

            <p>I never knew it finished. I just got finished reading that comic. That was a good run. I like how they characterized our little Sue. Her transformation from Sue to OC was smooth and believable. Overall, a very well written comic, for a silly parody on Mary Sues. <br><br>Is Ensign Sue Must Die in the list of Legendary Goodfics? If not... Well, I know it&#39;s more of a fan comic then fan fic, but I think an exception could be made in this case. Besides, the only difference is that comics tend to have more pictures. Anybody else agree?<br><br>Oh, and if anybody does not know what we are talking about, <a href="http://interrobangstudios.com/comics-display.php?strip_id=989">here is the first page.</a></p>

            <p>Especially with the Sues. I know, I&#39;m supposed to hate all Sues, but Ensign Sue is just so <i>cute!</i> She is absolutely adorable, and I love her for it.<br><br>I also love how God!Sue is not just Mary Sue (you know, the first one) but also a Suethor. Calling those who criticize her story trolls, forcing the world into how she wants it directly, (as opposed to most Sues, who do it unintentionally) and redeeming all of the Sues by maturing as a writer.<br><br>You know, the only thing I don&#39;t like is the insinuation that Twilight Sparkle is a Sue.

            <p>Feel free to list as many as come to mind!<br><br>&quot;People say you can&#39;t judge a book by its cover, but you can. You can open and close a book a thousand times and the words never change. Books never change [like people]. Books are safe.&quot; - the main character Katlin, from the book Mockingbird (NOT How To Kill A Mockingbird).<br><br>&quot;Nobody feels sorry for writers. If we want to write in the middle of the night, in a tree house in the backyard, wearing an electric lime green and orange ball gown, a beanie cap, wool socks, and Elmo slippers, that&#39;s our business.&quot; - Anne Mazer, from the book Spilling Ink.</p>

            <p>&quot;What an astonishing thing a book is. It&#39;s a flat object made from a tree with flexible parts on which are imprinted lots of funny dark squiggles. But one glance at it and you&#39;re inside the mind of another person, maybe somebody dead for thousands of years. Across the millennia, an author is speaking clearly and silently inside your head, directly to you. Writing is perhaps the greatest of human inventions, binding together people who never knew each other, citizens of distant epochs. Books break the shackles of time. A book is proof that humans are capable of working magic.&quot;<br><br>Never get tired of this one. :&#39;)</p>

            <p>&quot;You can&#39;t build a plot out of jokes. You need tragic relief.

            <p>And a hearty congratulations to the two of you.  I seem to remember a few LJ posts re: The Wedding, but I may be mistaken.

            <p>A) Do we have a department/division dedicated to the protection of less popular fandoms. Like, I know stuff like LotR are big enough to get their own division within DMS,  but do we have, like, an Eclectic Fandom division?<br><br>2) How come so many Department and Division Heads seem to have RCs as their office? For that matter, isn&#39;t all of Medical technically housed in RCs? Shouldn&#39;t we have specific rooms for those kinds of things?<br><br>III) On a more serious note, would people be interested in sharing why they spork? I&#39;ve been having some doubts about the PPC as a whole and I know I&#39;m not the first member to do so, so I figured getting perspectives from other people might be helpful, or at least interesting.</p>

            <p>The DMS has a &quot;Rare Fandoms and General Fiction&quot; division, according to the Complete List of PPC Fiction. I don&#39;t think too many agents there are active now, though. *shrug*<br><br>Also, I spork because it&#39;s fun and, as much as I try to give people the benefit of the doubt, some things just don&#39;t belong on the Internet.</p>

            <p>A) Others have covered this, but yeah, you&#39;re probably looking at either the DMS, Sub-department of Rare Fandoms; the ADP, [Insert Fandom Here] Division; or Floaters. Depends on whether you want to do just Mary Sue missions for a variety of fandoms, a variety of mission types for just one fandom, or a variety of missions for a variety of fandoms.<br><br>2) Why wouldn&#39;t they? A response center pretty much is a specialized office, albeit one that gets lived in. They&#39;re even described as offices in some stories I&#39;ve read. Also, where do you find that Medical is housed in RCs? That hasn&#39;t been my impression based on stories I&#39;ve read that feature visits to Medical. Anyway, not every room in HQ is a response center. See the Cafeteria, the Nursery, FicPsych, Intel, the various pubs, the auditoriums, the Armory, DoSAT, the laundry room(s), the Courtyard, and so on and so forth.<br><br>III) I got into sporking because I really enjoyed reading PPC stories and I wanted in on the fun of making them. Coming from a role-playing background where messing with other people&#39;s characters is practically a capital offense, I was a little nervous about assassinations at first, so that&#39;s why my first agent team is in the DIC. I got over it, though, because it&#39;s not like we&#39;re actually going in and changing their story. It&#39;s just a form of commentary. They&#39;re allowed to write their canon-warping, language-butchering fanfic, and I&#39;m allowed to write my mission to hyperbolically complain about it. Free speech is awesome like that. {= D<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

I see my favorite characters have their personalities mangled, I want to help them, dammit! I&#39;m waiting for an excuse to confirm one of Valon&#39;s LOs.

            <p>My favorite champs are Twisted Fate and Gangplank. Not as LOs, just thematically.

            <p>First, there are departments and divisions. The former deals with specific types of badfic. The latter deals with anything requiring a more specialized role. For example, there are divisions that deal with specific fandoms, or even a particular type of badfic within the fandom. So you could have one Agent be a part of the DMS, but be able to work in any fandom, because they are not specialized yet.<br><br>Second, I would guess that on the subject of RCs, that there is nothing special about them. As in, they were not built with any one function in mind, so they can be easily converted to serve a specific purpose. It would be like building an empty warehouse, and then adding the rooms, wiring, floors, etc. only with more insanity. When you factor in the complete lack of OSHA compliance, it would be easy to knock down and build walls as needed, while adding any tech the inhabitant would need.</p>

            <p>There&#39;s the Sub-department of Rare Fandoms, if that&#39;s what you&#39;re asking. It basically covers those rare fandoms not many people know about.<br><br>Second question... um, I don&#39;t know. Someone else would have to answer that. &gt;_<br>Thirdly, why do I spork? Well, it&#39;s fun. I like sending my agents into fanfics and seeing how they react, what creative ways they (and I) can come up with to kill Sues. It also keeps me on my toes regarding my favorite fandoms. If I do happen to come across something I&#39;m unsure about, I look it up to make sure, and that just increases my own knowledge. <br><br>I don&#39;t actually use my missions to tell authors what they&#39;re doing wrong; that would prove too many unwanted tantrums. If I&#39;m browsing the Pit and come across something that has potential to be a good story, I like to offer suggestions and then pray to god they don&#39;t take it the wrong way. I got very lucky with my latest find; the author requested I beta read for them and I agreed, so yay! Unfortunately, nobody likes being told their story needs work, even if it&#39;s blatantly obvious they have the grammar skills of a three year-old, never mind their skills at storytelling and characterization.<br><br>So, I spork for my own amusement, and try to offer concrit in other areas.</p>

            <p>(1) Unlike the Anime/Manga Division or the Video Games Division, the missions of the Sub-Department  of Rare Fandoms (under &quot;Small DMS Divisions: Rare Fandoms &amp; General Fiction&quot; on <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/The_Complete_List_of_PPC_Fiction">The Complete List of PPC Fiction</a>) are to worlds that don’t have much in common, like <i>The A-Team</i>, <i>Phantom of the Opera</i> and <i>Pride and Prejudice</i>. Thus, it is like many small divisions put together, put still too small (and too specialized on Mary Sues) to be a department on its own. The agents in this Sub-Department are probably too specialized in their continuum to work in the Freelance Division, but too few (only one or two agent pairs per word world) to warrant separate divisions.<br><br>(2) Historically, the Flowers were the first Agents, before they started to recruit agents from World One and other word worlds. Physically, there is probably not much difference between an RC and an office; it’s just a small room with a console and whatever accommodations the inhabitants need. Flowers and medical staff usually don’t go onto missions, but medics may be called in case of an emergency, and we have seen at least one nurse going into badfics in special circumstances. It seems plausible that just every small, inhabited room in HQ is called a Response Center and gets an RC number by the PPC’s incomprehensible RC numbering system.<br><br>(3) Well, I don’t spork, and I don’t even like reading fan fiction much. But I like to read about agents struggling with the badfic, and to think about how my agents would react to the absurd situations encountered in badfic taken literally. If I ever ask for Permission and write missions, it will be for the same reasons other people write fan fiction. Basically, I will write PPC fan fiction, and the sporking will come with it because that is what the PPC canonically does. When Agent Androia Avatar will rant about how Mary Sue has to die <b>now</b>, this will be her personality, not my opinion. (She is a <i>World of Warcraft</i> druid who believes that her duty is to protect and heal her world/all word worlds and its/their natural inhabitants, so intruders beware! At least that’s how her creator perceived the druidic mindset during the few days he actually played the game. Agent Hieronymus will be much more laidback and forgiving, and not happy about the need to follow traditional procedures.) But I’m afraid that I will be more interested in the dynamics of the player and his PC, and how Agent Hieronymus deals with the Pygmalion effect when he learns that Androia hates her unknown creator. It’s a story that can only be told in the absurd non-reality of the PPC. So there may be your answer: a mission is a review disguised as a story, and the enjoyment comes from turning something bad (a series of badfics) into the setup for something good.<br><br>HG </p>
