            <p>I&#39;m asking because I&#39;m horrible at drawing, and because I can&#39;t find a picture that matches his description on the Internet anywhere. Googling for pictures of Khajiit based on the Elder Scrolls: Skyrim game, specifically males, should give you an idea of how they&#39;re structured - the females are always thinner and more wiry in build, while the males are broad-shouldered and have a bit of muscle to them - and then I have Za&#39;kiir&#39;s looks on his profile to help with the rest. The basic thing to remember is that they&#39;re cat-humanoids. Thanks!</p>

            <p>I can&#39;t draw, sorry, so I can&#39;t help you with that, but you might be able to model him in the Skyrim character builder and then take a screenshot of that.  I only mention it because I nearly did the same thing for Aaron, but the lighting in the game is really bad.  From what I&#39;ve seen of Skyrim, a clear shot of his face should be easier to get.</p>

            <p>Once again, Boarders, I am in need of your expertise in a random area for the sake of a story. You see, I&#39;m setting up the magic system for my NaNoWriMo novel (National Novel Writing Month-- website <a href="http://nanowrimo.org/dashboard">here</a>. Trying to write a novel in a month; tons of fun and coffee!). It&#39;s based off of musical instruments: different instruments have different powers and specialties. Trumpets, for example, are great at demolition. Magic is broadly divided into physical magics and mind magics. <br><br>What I really want are the ins and outs of different instruments and a simple explanation of how they work (If you have anything to share on the personalities normally associated with different instruments, please share that as well). For example, I play the twelve hole ocarina. I blow into the mouthpiece and manipulate the air with twelve different holes. If I play for too long, my wrists get very sore from holding it correctly, and my left pinky starts to seize up a little (my left pinky stabilizes the instrument, and is almost always plugging its hole).<br><br>I can get explanations from the internet, of course, but I think personal stories will enrich the narrative. Thanks in advance; looking forward to the responses!<br><br>-Alleb</p>

            <p>Having seen various instruments in orchestra, here&#39;s a suggestion as to how they might work together in that sort of group:<br><br>Violins: Anything a violin can do, more violins can make better. They, along with the other stringed instruments, are the team players of the musical world. They&#39;re flexible, and an orchestra&#39;s complement of them can create some incredibly strong spells.<br><br>Woodwinds (Flutes, Oboes, so on): These guys do the orchestral odd-jobs. There usually aren&#39;t as many of them as there are of the violins, and they do better with the less overt magic. They round out an orchestra. Also, orchestras usually tune against the oboe, as it gives the most perfect A note.<br><br>Brass (trumpets, horns, et cetera): These guys do one thing and do it well. Their power is incredible, and is more geared towards destructive uses than the rest of the orchestra. If an orchestra wants to add sheer force to a spell or to use it to knock down a building or something, they can&#39;t do much better than give big roles to their brass section.<br><br>Drums: Drums are the rare-but-powerful kind of instrument. There&#39;s usually only one per orchestra, though when a Drumline is put together, however, it&#39;s an awesome sight/sound. Drums set the beat everyone else plays by, and their powerful tones permeate all the music. They go more for boosting their allies than direct attack, although use of cymbals carries great destructive force.<br><br>Piano: Discussed in an earlier post. They&#39;re another one-per-orchestra instrument. A piano&#39;s incredible versatility can back up a whole song.<br><br>Harp: Yet another one-or-two-per-orchestra. A Harp&#39;s magic is soft, but utterly pervasive. It&#39;s a bit like gravity, really.</p>

            <p>Here in Brazil we have a percussion instrument called berimbau. It&#39;s a one-stringed instrument composed of the following parts: a large wooden bow, a steel string and a hollowed out and dried gourd. You would also need a wooden stick, a small coin or rock and a shaker. <br><br>To play it, you need to hold the bow in one hand between the two middle fingers, while holding the coin/rock between your index finger and thumb. You must also rest the gourd, which is found at the bottom of the bow, against your chest. In your other hand you hold the stick and the shaker.<br><br>To produce a sound, you strike the string with the stick. The shaker accompanies the stick. You can also move the coin back and forth throught the string to change the pitch. Finally, moving the gourd back and forth from your chest produces a  wah-like sound.<br><br>This instrument is traditionally played during the practice of capoeira, an afro-brazilian martial art/dance.<br><br></p>

            <p>Yeah, it&#39;s rather complex. But looking on the bright side, with so many different elements required to play it, and thus to cast the spell, it could be quite versatile and/or cast some powerful spells.

            <p>In a sense, yes: the same way that a triangle is an instrument, or castanets. They can&#39;t carry a tune on their own, but if the beats are timed correctly they add power to the other instruments in a group. Drums are like that to some extent as well. <br><br>-Alleb</p>

            <p>When exactly are you setting this? I mean, if it&#39;s a medieval-ish High Fantasy setting, then 80% of what we&#39;ve been talking about becomes anachronistic. It&#39;s all very well us talking about, say, a band of enormously muscular barbarian mercenaries all wielding jazz clarinets and dressed like <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/7/79/Acker_Bilk.jpg">Acker Bilk</a>, but in a medieval setting there are no clarinets. And we&#39;re all sad.<br><br>What might be interesting, from a conflict setup point of view, is to set your story during the 1950s, with the rise of rock and roll. Then you basically have three camps:-<br><br>#1: The rock and roll mob, the young upstarts struggling to get recognition for their work from the older, more established magicians.<br><br>#2: The classical orchestral musicians, who are a bit more conservative and close-ranked than the egalitarian rockers and see themselves as guardians of an ancient tradition.<br><br>And finally, #3: The folk music crowd, on bagpipes and tin whistles and bodhrans and all the trappings of <i>really</i> ancient musical traditions, who just want to get back to nature and possibly drink some mead.<br><br>That&#39;s what I&#39;d do, anyway. =]</p>

            <p>The 50s is possibly my favorite era, and I absolutely love its music.

And I&#39;d have to do all of that in fifteen days, while preparing myself to become a DM (first game before Thanksgiving, whee!) and also doing regular real life stuff.

            <p>Especially the tap-dancing on a cat. <br><br>I&#39;m still trying to parse out how electronic instruments operate, if they do at all.

            <p>Like, people will accept <i>cannons</i> as part of magic, but synthesizers and keyboards and all that? Pfeh. They&#39;ve just made that up.<br><br>Drum machines are a bit of a weird case, but theremins and keyboards and the like do generate their own sounds rather than pull them from a library. The individual voices on a keyboard are preprogrammed, but it&#39;s all modulated by the press of the key. It&#39;s easy to draw a parallel between natural and electronic music and human and AI relations... hell, you could even have a background event be the first performance of an AI-composed symphony spell.</p>

            <p>I think everyone else has got how a piano actually works down, so I&#39;ll go more with how they might be used, along with player personality stereotypes. If you already have an idea of how pianos will work, then feel free to ignore the following two paragraphs. <br><br>Pianos would, I think, be a really versatile jack-of-all-trades type thing, as well as a day-to-learn-lifetime-to-master instrument. They&#39;re really powerful, but not good with battle, because they&#39;re complicated to play and really, could you imagine lugging a giant piano out into a battlefield? <br><br>Pianos would, however, be far better for civic use, because of the wide variety of things they could do, and when there&#39;s no war, there&#39;s usually no immediate deadline when you need to get the spell completed. <br><br>Piano players are, of course, associated with elegance and class, and sometimes snootiness. I think that they&#39;d be loners and pretty rare, because usually there&#39;s only one piano in a given musical group, and pianos are expensive. </p>

            <p>I also hadn&#39;t thought about leaving off a song and then completing it later: that&#39;s a really interesting mechanic, and it could save a lot of time on the battlefield. For instance, a band could play most of Totentanz, and then finish it quickly if someone dies. I&#39;d been trying to think of how to blend combat with songs up to 14 minutes long, and I think that might be the solution. Thanks! <br><br>-Alleb</p>

            <p>I think I mentioned it elsewhere, but I&#39;ll reiterate on this post so no one has to hunt around. <br><br>While individual instruments have different strengths and weaknesses, magical songs will do the same thing no matter what plays it. The only thing that differs is degrees of success. For example, a violin will do very well when hypnotizing someone, while a tuba... won&#39;t. <br><br>So here&#39;s where you guys come in! Think of your favorite songs and imagine what magic they might make. Feel free to go crazy: effects can range from hypnosis to creeping vines to shock waves. Songs can also vary. Bach? Sure. Daft Punk? Sure. Gregorian chants? Sure. Anything goes: I can always tone down or amp up an effect if I think it&#39;s necessary. <br><br>Have fun! <br><br>-Alleb</p>

            <p>The mental image of the Hypnotism Tuba is hilarious. <br><br>So, songs: <br><br>Dies Irae: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dlr90NLDp-0"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dlr90NLDp-0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dlr90NLDp-0</a></a><br><br>It&#39;s a song about the Christian apocalypse, sung at funerals, and kind of a poster song for Ominous Latin Chanting, so I&#39;d say it would cause a widespread fear effect among enemies. If given enough power, it could probably even kill.<br><br>Another option would be for it to be a musical Penance Stare, forcing people to confront their sins. After all, it&#39;s a song about judgement.<br><br>O Fortuna: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNWpZ-Y_KvU"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNWpZ-Y_KvU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNWpZ-Y_KvU</a></a><br><br>The song is about Fate (and another poster song for Ominous Latin Chanting), so I&#39;d say it could focus on manipulating luck, perhaps like an Entropy Curse from the Dresden Files (which manipulates luck so that the target dies).<br><br>Bonnie Ship the Diamond: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk2nIrZV-9w"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk2nIrZV-9w">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bk2nIrZV-9w</a></a><br><br>And now for something completely different. This song is a sea chantey and would have power over large bodies of water. It would probably act mostly as a counterspell against storms and so on. <br><br>Night Train: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPFZgeCtfag"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPFZgeCtfag">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPFZgeCtfag</a></a> (the video I chose is a Muppet Show performance of it, so please subtract the gibberish speaking and the explosions).<br><br>This Jazz hit does what its name suggests- it summons a magical train (tracks included).<br><br>The Pink Panther Theme: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OPc7MRm4Y8"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OPc7MRm4Y8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OPc7MRm4Y8</a></a><br><br>As well as being iconic, it would be a good choice for being able to conjure various crystals (the Pink Panther is a diamond)<br><br>Simple Gifts: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLAnuG1340g"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLAnuG1340g">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLAnuG1340g</a></a><br><br>This song might work as a general counterspell.<br><br>House of the Rising Sun: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzc20VmMCl8"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzc20VmMCl8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzc20VmMCl8</a></a><br><br>This would induce paralysis.<br><br>Carnival of the Animals: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBGEf4urGNo"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBGEf4urGNo">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBGEf4urGNo</a></a><br><br>Each movement would summon the animals associated with it (lions, chickens, donkeys, elephants, kangaroos, fish, people with long ears [not kidding, this is actually a movement], Cuckoos, birds in general, pianists [be careful, they may not like being summoned], fossils [animated ones], swans, and, if the player is a Disney fan, the conclusion summons flamingos with yo-yos)  <br><br>Swing Low, Sweet Chariot: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8frEt6w4G8"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8frEt6w4G8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8frEt6w4G8</a></a><br><br>Teleportation.<br><br>Scarborough Fair: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiZJP_XLmrQ"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiZJP_XLmrQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiZJP_XLmrQ</a></a><br><br>Sets a task that must be accomplished by anyone who wants to do a certain thing (say, get into a secure facility, or attack you).

            <p>I love these! The Pink Panther one also opens up an interesting question: if precious stones could be made on a whim (once this song was composed, of course) what else could be created, and how would that effect the economy? Furthermore, what if such songs were closely guarded secrets? I love questions like that. Thank you! <br><br>-Alleb</p>

            <p>Well, there are probably limits.

            <p>Ohhhh, I wonder what power a uke would have. x3<br><br>Um... The uke has four strings (GCEA) and you play it by holding down the strings on the frets to create higher notes. It is similar to a guitar. There are two for,s of playing, one/two string picking, and strumming.  On my left hand, the one that holds the notes, I generally get large callouses on the edge of my pointer finger (I have one right now, it&#39;s exactly where you&#39;d tap a screen on an iPad) and smaller ones on the edges of the middle, ring, and pinky. The thumb holds up the instrument and helps create enough pressure to make a clear note. The thumb gets extremely sore after playing. <br>On the other hand, the playing hand, it&#39;s extremely common to get blisters on your thumb and on the pointer finger, the two that do the most on that hand. If you get a blister it&#39;s hard to play while you have the blister.<br>Also, fun fact: ukulele means jumping flea</p>

            <p>I think, rather like the ocarina, it&#39;s underestimated. It&#39;s not the most powerful instrument, but it&#39;s fairly strong when it comes to mind magics, hypnosis in particular.

            <p>Now, to answer your question: I played piano for about ten years, but have fallen out of practice because college. In order to get the best sound out of the instrument, you have to relax your arms (especially the wrists) and curl your fingers a little. Piano music covers a whole range of emotions and moods--majestic, spooky, joyful, sad, romantic, elegant, even angry. My private teacher told me that I had to feel where the breaths were in the piece, if that makes sense to you.<br><br>I also sang in my school choir since eighth grade. After concerts, my chest and throat were always kind of sore. Singing is all about breath control and using your diaphragm, not your throat. My high school director was also on us about showing some enthusiasm during concerts; he referred to our neutral expressions as &quot;axe-murderer faces&quot;.</p>

            <p>So as you may (or may not) know, pianos are precussion instruments. The noise is created by having hammers drop on strings. (Kinda like guitar strings, but a bit stronger.) There are usually 2 pedals on a piano, the damper pedal, which lets you play in more muted tones, (good luck finding one that makes a substantial difference,) and the... sustain pedal? Something like that- which removes the damper, so the notes go on and on.<br><br>I usually think of the piano as the catch-all instrument; it&#39;s easy to use, but it forces you to learn how to read notes. I have had times where I&#39;ve slipped up and played the note next to the one that I meant to play, so that&#39;s a thing to look out for. And the worst things about them are: one, they are never tuned properly, two, when they aren&#39;t tuned properly they sound just wrong enough to bug you, but not much else, or notes make a weird buzzing noise, and three, you can&#39;t take them with you.</p>

            <p>But it takes years of practice to really <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMTdPRvOBxA">make it sing</a>.<br><br>And that&#39;s a shame you think pianos are never tuned properly, because mine, my teacher&#39;s, and the ones I&#39;ve played on for concerts have always been beautifully tuned, and all were a joy to play.<br><br>As for the (three) pedals:<br><br>The left pedal is called the <b>sustain pedal</b>, also known as the <b>damper pedal</b>. It extends notes so the player can take their hands away for other chords, and/or to accomplish a <i>legato</i> effect. It&#39;s also the most commonly used pedal; in my fourteen years of playing, I&#39;ve used the other two once each.<br><br>The middle pedal is called the <b>sostenuto pedal</b>, and it acts similarly to the sustain pedal, except the sostenuto sustains only selected notes. This is accomplished by first pressing the key(s) you want to sustain and then pressing the pedal.<br><br>The right pedal is called the <b>soft pedal</b>, or the <b><i>una corda</i></b>. It&#39;s generally used to soften the tone.<br><br></p>

            <p>Long, flexible fingers are very helpful when playing the cello, because of the sheer range of notes that one can play. You play it sitting down, with your fingers in various positions on the fingerboard, depending on what notes you want to play, then you drag the horsehair bow across the strings, similar to a violin, but a cello is bigger and held differently. Most cello players have learned at least two different clefs (bass and tenor). Some know more. It&#39;s a very versatile instrument, and even the basics can be taught in about a thousand different ways, and general consensus is that it&#39;s very difficult to play, and will definitely destroy the nerves and joints in your hands (back injury also looms rather threateningly from all that hunching you have to do to reach the high notes).<br><br>Cellos can be associated with harmony, good fortune, healing, and pleasure, particularly when appearing in dreams.<br><br>The players themselves, at least in my experience, are a snarky bunch, imaginative, practical, and tend to be the least impressed by anything that happens to the orchestra. They&#39;re also high achievers, and rather lonely.<br>To cellos, violas seem uptight and aloof, bass players are bat-feces insane (but awesome), and violinists are either chill or hated enemies - there is no in between. All inter-ensemble rivalries go out the window when the band shows up - that rivalry is INTENSE.<br><br>(Disclaimer: All of the third paragraph is based on generalizations of my own, admittedly limited experience. Please nobody take offense!)<br><br>Anyway, hope that helped. Good luck with your novel - I&#39;m participating in NaNo myself!</p>

            <p>I can&#39;t find a good video now, because phone, but the vertical viola is a larger-bodied viola that is played like a cello - it has a tailpin and is stood up vertically. Because it&#39;s significantly larger than a normal viola, it has a richer tone, more like a high cello than a low violin.</p>

            <p>Ocarinas can make it rain, summon horses, open telepathic links with your friends, turn day to night and back again, take you back in time, teleport you places...<br>Now let&#39;s talk about the violin. I never played it particularly well myself, but I knew a man who was, to say the least, quite good at it. He mentioned that there are two ways to play a violin - the classical violin, and what&#39;s known as the fiddle.<br>They&#39;re the same instrument, but not many people can play both ways.<br>Classical violin is mostly associated with sadness and mourning - slow performances with a ton of vibrato. The fiddle is much more cheerful - a dancing instrument, lifting the spirit. And it takes a lot of mastery to play both well.<br>As far as how it works... well, you have a bow, made of wood and horse hair, and you run it over the strings on the body of the violin. The vibration from that is then amplified by the hollow in the body. You choose notes by putting your fingers on the strings near the top of the neck of the violin. You can tune the strings with a number of pegs at the top of the violin. Vibrato is where you wiggle your fingers on the string, which mixes notes together a bit.</p>

            <p>Piano is a lot easier to play if you have long fingers; means you can stretch for some of the more difficult chords. And you&#39;d better hope your fingers aren&#39;t slippery when you play, or that&#39;s asking for a disaster. :P <br><br>I don&#39;t know about other players, but for me, I learn my pieces by muscle memory, so if I mess up with my fingering, it can throw me off pretty badly. I&#39;ve learned to hide my recoveries over the years, but just one slip can be scary.<br><br>French horn is played like other brass instruments; you put your mouth on the mouthpiece, purse your lips, and make a raspberry noise. Since the horn has a small mouthpiece, you have to purse your lips more than you would for, say, a trombone. <br><br><img src="http://data.yamaha.jp/sdb/local/products/images/8961/12001/8961_12001_1.jpg" alt="http://data.yamaha.jp/sdb/local/products/images/8961/12001/8961_12001_1.jpg"> <br><img src="http://accentmusicalinstruments.com/accent/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/HR952L.jpg" alt="http://accentmusicalinstruments.com/accent/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/HR952L.jpg"> <br><br>This here is a nice shint single horn (top) and a double horn (bottom). The double horn has a thumb key, whereas the single horn has a thumb hook to hold the horn. Since the double has an extra key, that means a lot more tubing, and it&#39;s consequently a lot heavier than the single horn. Single horns tend to be the go-to instrument for beginning horn players, since the double horn has a lot more key combinations to memorize for the different notes. Not to mention the double horn can be played as either an F horn or a B flat horn, while the single horn is F only.<br><br>(Also, random fun fact, the French horn was actually invented in Germany. :P)<br><br>There&#39;s also a triple horn, which I know combines F, B flat, and alto F into one instrument, but I&#39;ve never played one myself, so I won&#39;t get into discussing that one. :)</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve played the French horn for almost ten years at this point; it&#39;s definitely an experience. Like Iximaz said, the small mouthpiece to instrument ratio makes it a lot harder than a lot of the other brass instruments. <br><br>A single horn is normally in one key (Bb or F) whereas a double horn has both; pressing the trigger key, which is the one kinda in the back in the images, turns the horn from the default F horn into a Bb horn, which helps with the higher registers. The two horns have completely different fingerings until you hit a middle A, pretty much. (Also, because it took me a long time to figure out what having a horn in F meant— it&#39;s basically that an F on the horn is equal to a C on the piano.) Triple horn has the alto F set as well, so two trigger keys, which helps to get you into the even <i>higher</i> registers. One of my teachers let me play his triple horn for a concert once. It was wild.<br><br>Also, I read somewhere that the range of a French horn is the closest band instrument to actual human vocal range, and so is similar to the cello in that respect.<br><br>With the horn, your left hand goes on the keys— thumb on the trigger, index on the top one, etc., pinky in the ring at the bottom— and your right hand goes in the bell. This is to mellow out the sound and help keep it in tune. You can also use your hand to &quot;stop&quot; the sound to make it super brassy.<br><br>The French horn is also a weird finicky instrument. Because Reasons, a lot of the note intervals are very close together, especially in the higher ranges; this basically translates to being able to play an entire scale on one fingering, if you screw around with your mouth/hand (in bell) position enough. A lot of the notes are also played on the same fingering. For example, middle C, E, G, and high C are all played as open (no valves) on the F horn. IN ADDITION to that, you can also play the same note with multiple different fingerings; a D on a Bb horn can be played with the first and second valve or the third valve, and as just the first valve on the F horn.<br><br>One last paragraph: the first French horns actually didn&#39;t have valves at all! They were basically giant kazoos; instead of a million tuning slides like a modern horn, there&#39;s only one that can be swapped out depending on the key the piece is in. They&#39;re called natural horns and some people still play them today but god, why.<br><br><img src="http://www.alsmiddlebrasspages.com/mellophone/images/mellophones/lorenzhornk.jpg" alt="http://www.alsmiddlebrasspages.com/mellophone/images/mellophones/lorenzhornk.jpg"> <br><br>I think that&#39;s all I have to say right now? That basically covers most of the bases. :OO </p>

            <p>&quot;instead of a million tuning slides like a modern horn, there&#39;s only one that can be swapped out depending on the key the piece is in.&quot; This is also a Vienna horn! Natural horns mostly play harmonic ranges and have to stop the horn to get more notes, whereas Vienna horns actually have keys.<br><br>Vienna horn:<br><a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/58/Viennese_horn.jpg"><a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/58/Viennese_horn.jpg">https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/58/Viennese_horn.jpg</a></a></p>

            <p>I have no clue whether the horn would be more mental or physical. Possibly more mental-based? A lot of learning difficult pieces is figuring out which fingerings are easiest to do in progression because of all the alternate choices. This gets even more complicated when you&#39;re sight-reading on the fly with an orchestra, so there can be a fair amount of quick thinking involved. However, a huge part of playing the horn is in the lip control. It&#39;s very easy to slip from a higher interval into a lower one by accident. So. . . it could probably go either way! <br><br>People playing the horn, at any rate, tend to be really cool people. Kinda weird, and also super used to being ignored during rehearsals, which can lead to a lot of friendly goofing off and chill times.</p>

            <p>(This is also a reply to your first post, just so there&#39;s no confusion.)<br><br>Thanks for the info! The alternate fingering thing is really interesting-- definitely very hard. I&#39;m thinking the French horn will be more mental based, because of the complexity and the quality of its sound. It might also have varying power based on different fingerings... Hmm... This will be very interesting. Thanks again! <br><br>-Alleb</p>

            <p>I&#39;m sorta familiar with the piano; can&#39;t play it much, but I&#39;ve heard it enough to know what sorts of magic to imagine for it. <br><br>The horn, though, I know next to nothing about. The summary is greatly appreciated! In your opinion, would the French horn tip more towards physical or mind magics? This magic system is still in its baby stage (I just began it today) so pardon me if I&#39;m a bit vague. So far, I&#39;ve determined physical/mind proclivity by quantity of sound and what sort of songs an instrument sounds best with. Some are evenly balanced; the piano, for example. Trumpets can do some mind magic, while banjos are almost entirely physical. Where do you think the horn might fall? <br><br>Thanks again!<br><br>-Alleb</p>

            <p>(I used to play the piano till school got more intense. Wow, that was a long time ago.)<br><br>A piano is basically an array of metallic strings. When you strike a key, it causes a small (felt-covered, if I&#39;m not mistaken) hammer to hit the relevant string (there&#39;s one for each key, which means lots of strings!). Compare and contrast the harpsichord, which is one of the piano&#39;s predecessors, where the keys cause a &#39;finger&#39;-ish thingy to strum the strings; that&#39;s why the harpsichord sounds a) metallic and b) a bit similar to a guitar.<br><br>Anyway, as Ixi said, long fingers are a blessing for a piano-player, as are thin fingers; if you have large fingers like me, you&#39;ll manage to get... &#39;additions&#39; to what you&#39;ve planned to play.<br><br>The thing is, a piano is a really diverse instrument; it has a large range (compared to say, a violin or a horn or a flute) and you can do a lot with it; it only depends on the composer.<br><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0zPokdN2wg">Have some Bach, because Bach wrote some <i>amazing</i> harpsichord concertos.</a></p>

You can spork things like this with one simple charge: Trying to shoehorn a religion into a continuum that does not focus on said religion. Anything involving prayer or things like that can simply be labeled uncanonical-religion is never mentioned in Harry Potter&#39;s world, for instance, so anything that would be considered out of the ordinary in World One would probably be unlikely there as well, considering that the Harry Potter continuum is essentially part of an otherwise identical universe to World One.<br><br>(Plus, we could just charge &#39;em for trying to shoehorn in a religion that has no place in the continuum in question.)<br><br>Furthermore, the &quot;Prayer Warriors&quot; are implied to be native to World One-they&#39;re Sues, and therefore, our problem.

            <p>There is a church, and a Christmas service, in <i>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows</i>, and although they have a Yule Ball in <i>Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire</i>, the winter feast at Hogwarts is generally referred to as &quot;Christmas&quot;.  Also, since we apparently agree that the potterverse is just like World One unless stated otherwise, all kinds of Christian and non-Christian denominations exist there, including the ultra fanatics the Prayer Warriors are based upon. Thus, you cannot charge for &quot;uncanonical-religion is never mentioned in Harry Potter&#39;s world&quot;, or for shoehorning something in that implicitly is already there (and probably one of the reasons for the International Statute of Secrecy). <br><br>Better pro-mission arguments would be: <ul>
<li>This version of Hogwarts needs to be burned strictly based on being an uncanonical straw-castle filled with pumpkin-headed straw-men. The actual dispute in which these straw-men are used doesn’t matter at all.<br>
</li>
<li>The Department of Technical Errors could have a feast with this, without actually discussing the content (except internal continuity). </li>
</ul>
<br>If you can restrain yourself, and are sufficiently skilled to write agnostic, genderless, alien agents who genuinely don’t understand misogyny and homophobia, don’t care to comment on the human’s beliefs, and leave judgement of anything that the Prayer Warriors claim to be commanded by their god (yes, that includes the cruel punishments that so upset you) to the Spanish Inquisition or whoever may feel fit to act as a scripture canon expert, you may be able to write a decent mission. But I’m not sure whether you would have fun doing it this way, and if you don’t have fun doing it and the community doesn’t want to see it done anyway, you better shouldn’t do it.<br><br>(Note: I’m agnostic, so this is none of my concerns, but the Spanish Inquisition might well have decided that claiming to be a prophet chatting with Jesus is blasphemous and that the heretic should be burned on the stake.)<br><br>HG (who MST’ed &quot;Hogwarts School of Prayer and Miracles&quot; in the 2014 badfic games, because that’s the place to where I take my Bad Ideas)</p>

            <p>Religion is just too touchy a subject to bring into mockery, even if you directly avoid mocking the religion itself. The badfic is just too entwined in the religious aspect to make it a target. Hands off. It&#39;s been noted in <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Guide_to_the_PPC#What_NOT_to_Write">several</a> <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=263912;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">places</a> that we don&#39;t go there. I tried to claim Prayer and Miracles a while back and got told no for these exact reasons. Sorry. <br><br>Your attitude of &quot;We&#39;re all in this to kill bad fan fiction: religion shouldn&#39;t get a free pass.&quot; comes uncomfortably close to violating the Constitution. Watch it. We&#39;re not going to bash a fic because we don&#39;t agree with the religious beliefs presented. No, not even if we don&#39;t like it. No, not even if it appears to be a troll. There&#39;s plenty of other badfic out there that you shouldn&#39;t need to go after the religious ones.</p>

Yes, really. Taking this bastard down&#39;s gonna be difficult: he can apparently use some kind of radar to detect creatures.

So she does the natural thing-turn them all into animated dolls against their will by poisoning them! This is on the same level of messed-up as Cupcakes, and believe you me, it will meet the same fate.</p>

            <p>You are flat-out wrong about this. Religion in badfic is a far more complicated question than you seem prepared to acknowledge. I do think you can have a mission to a not!Christian badfic when the stars align correctly (Brewdening Love would be my pick if pushed), but your views make me ashamed to be on even vaguely the same side as you.<br><br>Also, bear in mind that Permission Get! usually takes a few goes, and having seen a few of your requests over the years? It&#39;s hardly a foregone conclusion you&#39;re going to get it. Especially on the strength of your post here. If you think we&#39;re writing missions because the badfic has to die, then you&#39;ve missed the point so badly your bullet ain&#39;t even on the same planet.<br><br>I used to be and feel like you. I got better, for the most part. I&#39;m sure you will too, given time.</p>

The Stu is... actually rather plain-A T. rex with Giganotosaurus arms.

            <p>Or is it just that no-one&#39;s interested in writing missions for RPF anymore?  The wiki doesn&#39;t explain why it stopped.<br><br>Either way, I know I&#39;d love to read some more RPF missions.  Badly done Real Person Fics are so much much worse than other forms of badfic.

            <p>But if it is, that&#39;s the reason.

            <p>It is <i>very</i> painful to see, hear, and/or listen to. Especially when the person who wrote it is convinced that everything they wrote is true.<br><br>Even if you go into RPF with the best intentions, you gotta remember: in fiction, you&#39;re able to get directly inside the characters&#39; heads. In real life, you don&#39;t have that advantage. Heck, I had some real life &#39;friends&#39; who thought the story my classmate wrote about me was true, and they supposedly knew me better than anyone.<br><br>Just my two cents, but I think we ought to stay away from it, because the only person who would really be able to call what&#39;s OOC would be the real people themselves.

            <p>Both of them deal with the Dresdenverse, and the first one is a crossover :<br><br>- &quot;<a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4998937/2/Blurred-Lines"> Blurred Lines</a>&quot;. A crossover with Twilight, featuring a Stu Warden, and a cheap imitation of Dresden, is going to his new assignment in the North-West. I only read the first chapter for now, but it&#39;s already a train wreck all around. <br><br>- &quot;<a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11158773/1/WhatYouWishFor">WhatYouWishFor</a>&quot;. It could have been a good idea, showing the first time Harry worked with the police of Chicago, but this story goes just as well as the title suggests.<br><br>P.S. : If it&#39;s not inconvenient, could I get other Boarders&#39;  opinions about the second one, please? I&#39;m thinking about picking this one when I&#39;ll try to get Permission.<br></p>

            <p>Yikes. Real Person Fic is weird enough already without the whole mutant thing.<br><br>I have a contribution of my own. This used to be on Unclaimed back before I did my epic cleanup (which might be due soon again...), and since it wasn&#39;t deleted I preserved the information in OneNote. So here it is again, <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8839476/1/Vongola-XI-Our-lives">&quot;Vongola XI: Our lives&quot;</a>. Whoever first posted it said it best:<br><blockquote>Let&#39;s see... She&#39;s the daughter of the Decimo, which is Tsunayoshi Sawada. She is as strong as her father, and oh look, she also has guardians that are either the son or daughter of one of Tsunayoshi&#39;s guardians.</blockquote>

            <p>I would&#39;ve enjoyed this mission except there were twontimes when you said Time Lords had perfect memories.  The first time I forced myself to ignore it, but the second time had me literally shouting at the screen.  (My throat is now sore, and my cat is terrified.)<br><br>Anyway, just look at the trouble the first Doctor had remembering Ian Chesterton&#39;s surname.  (And that wasn&#39;t deliberate teasing, because he still had trouble getting it right talking to himself after Ian had left.)<br><br>Then there&#39;s the second Doctor&#39;s famous line about the Daleks: &quot;I know the misery they cause, the destruction. But there&#39;s something else more terrible, something I can only half remember.&quot;<br><br>In case you think this only applies to the Doctor, just look how absent-minded the Time Lords are in &quot;The Deadly Assassin&quot;.  They&#39;ve even forgotten most of their own history.<br><br>This also continues into the new stuff.  Look at all the effort it takes before the Doctor finally recalls the planet Raxacoricofallapatorius in &quot;World War 3&quot;.<br><br>And, of course, Time Lord memories can also be temporarily wiped by Timey-wimey stuff, as in &quot;Trial of a Time Lord&quot; and &quot;Day of the Doctor&quot;.  (Maybe Time Lord agents should get temporary amnesia when fics have timeskips or tense shifts!)<br><br>So, while I can imagine the Librarian promoting the myth of Time Lords having perfect memories, Des should&#39;ve challenged him on it.  (&quot;Did you <i>forget </i>how easily your people forget things?&quot;)<br><br>Uh...<br><br>Sorry, for ranting on like that, but I can get a bit obsessive about Classic Who.  The rest of the mission was good.<br></p>

            <p>1) According to the <a href="http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Gallifreyan_physiology#The_brain">, which in turn bases itself on &quot;The Eleventh Hour&quot;, Time Lords have &quot;a form of eidetic memory, able to recall every detail of even the most insignificant moments in time&quot;. Since I (and other writers here besides) have mentioned this more than once, I&#39;m going to stick with this (and at least be more consistent than the show in that regard).<br><br>2) Des&#39; knowledge of Time Lord physiology is limited; what&#39;s more, other people beside the Librarian have told him that Time Lords can&#39;t forget, so why should he challenge that claim? And anyway, I don&#39;t know if you&#39;ve noticed, Des doesn&#39;t go challenging every absurd claim the Librarian makes. The reason is that he simply doesn&#39;t bother; he&#39;s got better things to do with his time.</a></p>

            <p>The Eleventh Hour shows the the eleventh Doctor has an eidetic short-term memory.  He recalls every insignificant detail of the last few seconds.  That&#39;s all we see.<br><br>Despite what the DW wiki says, there&#39;s nothing to suggest he has a similar long-term memory too.  Even if he has, there&#39;s still no reason to assume that the other Doctors have any kind of eidetic memory, never mind the other Time Lords.  (If anything, it probably owes more to the eleventh Doctor as a Moffat protagonist than as a Time Lord.  Sherlock and Jekyll both have eidetic memories too.  Moffat obviously loves this gimmick!)<br><br>I&#39;ve edited the DW wiki to make it more accurate.  But it&#39;ll probably just get reverted back.

I wasn&#39;t ignoring what you said, just trying to avoid a long, pointless argument that will eventually sink into bickering about UNIT Dating.

            <p>I suppose you did not want to sound like this, but this post feel a bit too rude. You say that there is no solid proof of eidetic memory for the Time Lords, and that continuity can be really screwed if we think about this too hard, fine, you are making your point alright, but here you&#39;re treating the other side of the debate like fanbrats without any ability for judgement and discussion. <br><br>Once again, this only the feel I get, I sure hope I&#39;m dead wrong, and I&#39;m sorry for bringing this up.<br><br>Last point, you ranted in the first place because Des said Time Lords got eidetic memory...

            <p>Hoom, hoom. Let&#39;s see...<br><br><b>Agents:</b><br>Let&#39;s start with Aiko. Since I don&#39;t know very much about the <i>Digimom</i> franchise, I&#39;m afraid there&#39;s not much I can comment on in regards to how well it merges with canon. I was a tad disappointed I didn&#39;t get a good sense of what she looks like other than &#39;blue eyes blonde hair&#39;, but since that&#39;s not the most important thing we&#39;re looking for, I&#39;ll let it slide.<br><br>However, her personality section, I didn&#39;t feel like I really got an idea of who she is. &quot;Due to her experience with her home fic, she dislikes ... Suvian children of canon characters (they make her look bad by association), and shipping in which either party (or a character “in the way”) is replaced/thrown wildly OOC, or where the designated third wheel gets killed off.&quot; These are both extremely common in fics; I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve seen a single agent who <i>likes</i> these clichйs. The dislike of &quot;AU badfic (especially darker AUs)&quot;, however, makes a lot more sense, considering her backstory. While that, and the part about her relying too much on other people to be happy, are nice little nuggets of information and her personality, I&#39;m left feeling like there should be a bit more to her.<br><br>On Henry: Ehhh. He looks like a decent character, but I find his backstory questionable. At age 19, he could have conceivably begun training as a Healer (thus explaining his utilization of healing spells), but instead, you say he was originally being trained as an Auror. While I can see him possibly picking up on a small handful of healing spells from his family members, the fact that he uses healing spells more than anything is... odd. Especially since they&#39;re generally supposed to be kind of difficult to perform. I could buy it if he was originally a Healer in training, but since he was an Auror, it just doesn&#39;t add up.<br><br>You did give me a bit better picture of what he looks like, so there&#39;s something. &quot;Always seen wearing identical red and gold plain robes.&quot; is a sentece fragment, by the way, which leads me to...<br><br><b>SPaG</b><br>This was... not very good. Along with the aforementioned sentence fragment, here are some of the goofs I spotted.<br><br>&quot;It was thankful that the students there had enchanted frogs to guide the way,&quot;<br><br>I think perhaps you meant &quot;It was a good thing that the students there had enchanted frogs&quot;.<br><br>&quot;His troubles suddenly came to an end when he banged his head on a door, having distracted by the thought about a goodfic.&quot;<br><br>It looks like you&#39;re missing a word here. Perhaps &quot;having been distracted by&quot;, though then the sentence would become even wonkier.<br><br>&quot;So he waited a few minutes to see anyone was already there.&quot;<br><br>Another missing word; this should be &quot;waited a few minutes to see if anyone was already there&quot;.<br><br>And that&#39;s just a sample; I don&#39;t want to go searching for everything I noticed and put them here.<br><br>I didn&#39;t notice as many SPaG errors in the second prompt, but I <i>did</i> notice something that started bugging me: consistency. You used !? in the first prompt, and ?! in the second. You&#39;ll want to make sure you&#39;re consistent in how you format thing.<br><br><b>The Prompts</b><br>I don&#39;t really have much to say here; I did like the second one more than the first, mostly because you did a pretty good job of showing Aiko&#39;s franticness in how she was flinging stuff everywhere, rather than just telling us she was panicked.<br><br>The first prompt, though, I felt was just &#39;eh&#39;. You had a lot more of telling and a lot less of showing. For example:<br><br>&quot;“Wow, how often do you see two non-canon children OCs in the same place? Guess both of you were Sues back in the day,” Henry said somewhat thoughtlessly.&quot;<br><br>We can see for ourselves that Henry&#39;s comment is thoughtless, so you don&#39;t need to inform the readers as such.<br><br>&quot;At this point Henry figured it was best to concede defeat. These girls sure could scary when they got angry.&quot;<br><br>This one actually jarred me out of the story, because the way it was written gave me the sense that Aiko was more sad-upset than &#39;angry-upset. So when what I was told differed from what I was shown, it threw me off.<br><br><b>Overall,</b> I think you&#39;ve got a lot of potential, but for now I&#39;m going to have to say Permission Denied. Here&#39;s to wishing you better luck next time.<br><br>And... speaking of next time, you might want to wait a bit. When your last Permission request is still visible on the front page, that tells me you didn&#39;t take enough time to think over your prompts. And, well, it kind of showed here. <br><br>So be patient, polish it as best you can, and you&#39;ll be able to present a much better request next time. :)</p>

            <p>I was going to fix some of those errors you pointed out, I swear! (I didn&#39;t think about the Healer thing for Henry either, oops ^<em>^;)<br><br>On a non-me-related note, I caught a mini. *wrangles Digimom* There&#39;s no mention of what type it is on the <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Digimon">wiki page</a>, so I hereby proclaim it <b>the mini-Agumon</b>! Generic franchise terms and other non-specific misspellings take this form of mini-Digimon. Misspelled character names appear as a mini of that character&#39;s associated Digimon/Digipartner; mini-Patamon for &lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://digimon.wikia.com/wiki/Kari">http://digimon.wikia.com/wiki/Kari</a></em>Kamiya&quot;&gt;Kari Kamiya</a>, mini-Gomamon for <a href="http://digimon.wikia.com/wiki/Joe_Kido">Joe Kido</a>, and so on. <br><br>Mini-Digimon look like the Rookie forms of whatever Digimon they spawn as, except only eighteen inches high. Since they&#39;re sentient data both in and out of canon, they don&#39;t exactly eat. Like mini-Aragogs, mini-Missingno, and mini-Baymaxes, they can speak English; their grasp of it is equivalent to that of a smart fifth-grader, however.

            <p>If Digimon-minis actually worked in manner you are describing here, misspelling Kari&#39;s name would generate a mini-Gatomon. A Misspelling of T.K.&#39;s name would be the one spawning a mini-Patamon.<br><br>And while Digimon ARE sentient data both in and out of canon, they DO eat. For example, Agumon digivolved to Greymon in <a href="http://digimon.wikia.com/wiki/The_Birth_of_Greymon">The Birth of Greymon</a> partly because Tai was being stubborn about feeding him when all the others didn&#39;t because their Digimon had said that they could manage by themselves. And you would be hard-pressed to find more than a few episodes of 02 where the Digimon weren&#39;t munching candy that Yolei brougt them from her family&#39;s store at some point while they were in the real world.<br><br></p>

            <p>You know, since I&#39;m the most likely to be the next to write a mission in the Digimon continuum, once I do get permission of course, I might just use a tweaked version of your idea for minis. Assuming of course that a new DigiOFU hasn&#39;t created one by then, which seems really unlikely.</p>

            <p>What I meant was that I am not going to try again at least until this Permission attempt also drop offs the page. I am not going make another attempt until that happens AND the docs are at their best possible shape . Hope that clears it up. <br><br>Can I ask for some advice? I don&#39;t know how I didn&#39;t see the contradiction you pointed out in Henry&#39;s background.

But is there any way I could have him previously have started Healer training and then end up working in an Action Department ? Because that probably would be just as much of a contradiction, wouldn&#39;t it? </p>

            <p>I was only pointing out that his use of healing spells despite being an Auror was off. <br><br>If you want to keep the Healer part of his background, you could maybe make it because his entire family are healers, he went into the practice as well, but when he arrived in the PPC, he decided an Acton department just looked like more fun.<br><br>That&#39;s just what I&#39;d suggest, so feel free to take it, leave it, tweak it, whatever.<br><br></p>

            <p>Aiko&#39;s personality:   I want to at least keep the bit about her parents because that is more specific to her and I have a few Digimon badfics that do precisely that to T.K. that I want to take down. But aside from that, what aspects of her personality do you think need to be fleshed out the most? <br><br>The part that jarred you out of the story: Last time around, pretty much the only thing that was suggested to fix about Henry was that there was an apparent disconnection between him being very blunt and also restrained around Aiko because she is sensitive. Originally, that scene went more like this: Henry made a insentitive comment, Aiko began to cry and Henry then almost immediately apologized. <br><br>The way I did it this time around seems to be more interesting, at least up until the point that threw you off. I definitely don&#39;t want that happening to the reader, but I also want to write it in such a way that generates more conflict and makes it clear that Henry isn&#39;t the most perceptive person when it comes to how his comments affect other people. Which is why added that bit about him only stopping once it was blatantly clear that he had missed the mark and made them angry. I probably should realized that there was a disconnection between that and the way I had previously written the scene, I don&#39;t know why I didn&#39;t. Can you offer any advice as to how to both accomplish that and make it more conductive to the feeling you were getting from the story up to that point?<br><br>   <br><br> </p>

            <p>Or at least there was. I found a fic on the Pit that the author calls an AU of The Official Fanfiction University of Digimon. The same author posted another story on mediaminer.org, a dedication to the OFUD, saying that both the OFU and that very story were taken off the Pit. And that was WAY back in late 2002. I can find any references to a new one. <br><br>The username of the author of the former OFUD is given: Frozen Phoenix. There is an user with exact same username on the Pit but there is no way to tell wheter is the same person.<br><br>So in conclusion: There was an OFU, and therefore mostly like a Mini, for Digimon but both have been lost to the Nether.

            <p>I would&#39;ve posted this yesterday, or heck, on Monday, but things have been busy on my end. Anyway, this was a few months overdue, in no small part due to the movie rotations causing flicks to arrive at our theater much later than the more expensive ones, but after like, five months of waiting... I finally got to see <i>Jurassic World.</i><br><br>My thoughts on this movie? Well, it&#39;s got its share of flaws, but these are relatively minor ones - and needless to say, the rest of it is truly a Jurassic-sized spectacle.<br><br>Check out my full review, in which I discuss marketing, female representation, and more teeth, <a href="http://armorbirdpress.tumblr.com/post/131203700633/armor-bird-reviews-jurassic-world">over on Armor Bird Press!</a></p>

            <p>i like that film if only because it is so ridiculous.  Seriously, has no one learned anything from Film One?  The characters keep making the same kinds of mistakes, only this time on a much larger scale.  And yet I can help but enjoy the stupidity of the characters.  </p>

            <p>Okay, putting my hand up here: I loved this film to bits, it&#39;s the one I&#39;ve been wanting to see since JP itself - the one where <i>there is a working dinosaur park</i>. I would gleefully watch a whole series of &#39;we built yet another park; it didn&#39;t work out&#39; films. I loved the numerous nods to the first film (and decided for myself that the <i>T. rex</i> had to be the same one from the original film - before checking the Internet and discovering that yep, she is ^_^), and the... y&#39;know... everything. Despite the &#39;duh&#39; moments (#1 offender: &#39;we can&#39;t find the <i>I. rex</i> in its pen! Let us walk inside and open the doors, because cameras are haaaaaard!&#39;), it was a ridiculously awesome film.<br><br>But. <i>I. rex</i>. It, uh... was basically a massive cluster of Chekhov&#39;s DNA. It can go IR-invisible, which was referenced once (okay, I guess it was vaguely relevant because they couldn&#39;t track it? But they managed to keep on top of things pretty well). It can camouflage... once, and I didn&#39;t even notice it had happened, except that someone yelled it. One of the best things in <i>The Lost World</i> (the book) was the camouflaging <i>Carnotaurs</i> - they were only a short sequence, and no-one even got roared at, but they were genuinely chilling. Things can be scary without roaring!<br><br>But <i>I. rex</i>... well, like you quoted, &#39;more teeth&#39;. And that lost quite a few ways to make it scarier by being, you know... quieter and sneakier.<br><br>Still a very awesome movie, though.<br><br>~<br><br>So here&#39;s a question, then. If you were a struggling dinosaur park, whose guest numbers were flagging - what would <i>you</i> cook up to bring them flooding back? A hybrid (and of what?)? Some sort of event (come on, people would flood in to watch <i>T. rex</i> hunting flocks of <i>Gallimimus</i>)? Realism (&#39;You think you know <i>Deinonychus</i>... you ain&#39;t seen nothing yeMURDERCHICKENOFDOOM!)? A concerted effort to find some particular dinosaur&#39;s DNA? What&#39;s the best plan, here?<br><br>(<i>I. rex</i> clearly isn&#39;t it. &#39;Let&#39;s build a socially-inept hybrid of all the worst things!&#39; Yeah, no.)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>And I second the notion that the I. rex should&#39;ve used its abilities more often in the movie, because that would&#39;ve at least helped drive home how dangerous it really was. You know the completely silent out-of-nowhere appearance of Rexy at the end of the first JP? Imagine that, but with the intent of killing the people rather than saving them. Now <i>that</i> would&#39;ve made me jump outta my seat!<br><br>TBH, I think retooling the park to be more like a nature safari (&quot;See dinosaurs IN THEIR NATURAL ENVIRONMENTS, and not stuffy CAGES! Watch them ACTUALLY INTERACT WITH EACH OTHER! Let them FIGHT!&quot;) would be the best bet here, with realism optional because either people want accurate dinosaurs to please the scientists or movie-style ones for the casual fans. But yeah, if the Battle at Kruger is any indicator, people love seeing animals fight, and I&#39;m pretty sure setting up a working ecosystem where the dinosaurs can freely prey on each other would be a good way of accomplishing that.</p>

            <p>Alright, here&#39;s a weird thing. I&#39;ve read everywhere, from wikis to fanfiction, that Amrod dies when Fлanor burns the ships at Losgar. But I&#39;ve scoured my copy of <i>The Silmarillion</i> cover to cover, and I haven&#39;t found any mention of it. Quite the contrary; the map (which shows all of the places where the Fлanorians settled) in my copy has an area clearly labelled &quot;Amrod and Amras.&quot; My copy also explicitly mentions Amrod and Amras dying in the attack on Sirion. So... does anyone know what&#39;s up? Does anyone else&#39;s copy say this? I&#39;m very confused. <br><br>-Alleb</p>

            <p>that JRRT went through various versions of the story, which left Christopher Tolkien in the position of trying to decide which was <i>the</i> definitive version. Later on, when going through the late papers, CT discovered the story of Amrod dying at Losgar.<br><br>A similar thing happened with the parentage of Gil-Galad; years later (when going into more detail for the History of Middle Earth) CT concluded that JRRT&#39;s final word on the subject was Gil-Galad as the son of Orodreth.<br><br>A lot of it is due to the sheer volume of papers that JRRT left behind, and CT was under a fair bit of pressure to get the Silm published quickly (the Silm was released only 4 years after JRRT died), which meant he had to assemble a narrative (relatively) quickly without the ~20 years of textural analysis which produced Unfinished Tales and the History of Middle Earth books.<br><br>Elcalion</p>

            <p>... the difficulty is that while the Professor wrote one of the twins dying at Losgar, he never carried that change through. So the rest of the story still refers to both of them being alive. Relatedly, the narratives concerning the death - specifically two scenes with Nerdanel, one with her prophesying the death, and one with her begging Feanor to leave the twins in Valinor - were never slotted into the story; there&#39;s no hint in the <i>Silm</i> narrative as to where they fit. (The latter, for instance, would need to fall between the Oath and the Kinslaying - but the narrative runs at high speed in that section, and wouldn&#39;t easily take an injected Family Moment.)<br><br>So Christopher excised it, because there was no way to fit it into the story without massively rewriting sections of the Darkening of Valinor. It&#39;s a defensible decision, though I do wish he&#39;d come out with an Extended Edition incorporating all that sort of material. (It&#39;s been noted that the women of the Noldor get <i>massively</i> cut down in the published Silm.)<br><br>Gil-Galad&#39;s parentage, on the other hand, has been admitted as a simple mistake: Christopher didn&#39;t realise at the time that it was only a passing notion.<br><br>hS</p>

He very tidily assembled all of the other candidates he could reach into his own realm - Idril fled to the Havens of Sirion, and it&#39;s entirely probable Celebrimbor was there, too. Galadriel was out of reach in the east, and the remaining sons of Feanor were distinctly unwanted. He also snagged Elwing, Thingol&#39;s most recent heir, and had the approval of Cirdan Lord of the Havens (can we say &#39;power behind the throne&#39;?).

            <p>... the only person I&#39;ve seen claiming that is me. :D<br><br>I&#39;m going to be honest: if the High Kingship excludes the female line(s), that is ridiculously stupid, sexist, and offensive. I would vastly prefer it not to be the case, and view it as authorial bias rather than proper worldbuilding.<br><br>You <i>could</i> argue that female-line is allowed, just not actual females. That would allow Earendil, Elrond, Elros, Elladan, Elrohir, and potentially Eldarion, to make a claim, and given that only one of them (Earendil) was born at the time Turgon died - and was, like, five - it wouldn&#39;t be too hard to make the case stick.

            <p>It does, but it doesn&#39;t provide any references. They claim that &#39;Elrond was a direct descendant of Turgon; he never made claim to the Kingship but ruled with all its authority&#39;, which is... frankly dubious, given that we never saw Elrond exert any authority over the Grey Havens, the last Noldorin realm in existence. They also say that &#39;It has been argued that following Gil-galad’s death, Elrond had the right to become High King of the Noldor, but he never claimed the title&#39;, which makes the lack of references explicit.<br><br>They <i>do</i> cite the claim that &#39;Galadriel of the House of Finarfin perhaps could have some rights&#39;, but it&#39;s cited to Foster&#39;s <i>Complete Guide to Middle-earth</i>, ie, not the canon. I may have a copy of that, so I&#39;ll look it up if I think of it.<br><br>As for the Numenoreans... actually, that&#39;s a point <i>against</i> female-line succession! Per Tolkien Gateway again:<br><br><i>Before Tar-Aldarion changed the Law of Succession in Nъmenor <b>only the son of the King could be the King&#39;s heir or, if he had no son, then the nearest male kinsman of male descent</b> from Elros Tar-Minyatur would be King. This meant that Malantur (grandson of Tar-Elendil&#39;s younger brother Eдrendur) was in line for the Sceptre. After Tar-Aldarion changed the law, his daughter Ancalimл could become the ruler of Nъmenor. But because of a clause in the changed law that said that the Queen had to marry in order to keep her position and could not die childless, Soronto apparently remained hopeful of receiving the Sceptre.</i><br><br>The entire female line was excluded from the Numenorean kingship until Tar-Ancalime. The question is, whose inheritence rules were they following? Elros was descended from the royal houses of Beor, Hador, Doriath, and Gondolin; his people were mostly Hadorian. We know the Doriathrin line passed through women (to Dior &#39;Thingol&#39;s Heir&#39;, by Luthien); we don&#39;t really know about the others, but the only Noldorian one is Gondolin (and they were weird anyway). So, circumstantially, women may have been excluded from Noldorin royalty - but as you say, it&#39;s pretty indirect.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Who summoned the White Council? Galadriel. Who was the only remaining heir of Finwл to remember the Trees? Galadriel. Who kept an eye on Dol Guldur for half the Third Age? Yeah, Galadriel. Oh, and she was Elrond&#39;s mother-in-law, so she&#39;d come before him in inheritance. Maybe. Or maybe I&#39;m just making things up.<br>In any case, she was certainly the leader of the Exiles for the Third Age.

            <p>The trouble is, the Elvish population in the Third Age was almost exclusively Wood-elves. The two major realms, Lorien and Mirkwood, were made up of that people - but led by exiles of Beleriand (Galadriel the Noldo, Celeborn and Thranduil the Sindar). West of the Mountains you have Elrond running a single household (and Tolkien&#39;s drawings make it clear that he was literally thinking of a single house). The only Noldorin/Sindarin realm of any size was the Grey Havens at Mithlond, which was ruled by... Cirdan, who technically isn&#39;t even Sindarin (&#39;Sinda&#39;, or &#39;Grey-elf&#39;, properly applies to those who got the Light of Aman by proxy from Thingol and Melian. Cirdan was never subject to Doriath, so he&#39;s a category all to himself.) Cirdan was also the one whose realm Gil-Galad co-opted - and was the <i>only</i> elf in Middle-earth in the Third Age to remember the Waters of Awakening.<br><br>Ultimately, I think the authority of the High King lay fallow for a long time, until it was taken up by the White Council itself. Which was led by Saruman... ;)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p><i>I assume that, in matters of Canon, the poor guy actually dies at Losgar?</i><br><br>Elvish answer. :D Since the published <i>Silmarillion</i> says Amrod lived through the Wars of the Jewels, it would be kind of dodgy to tell people off for writing exactly that. But, yes, to go by Tolkien&#39;s ultimate plans, he should be dead. One assumes he&#39;s Not Talking to Feanor down in Mandos.<br><br>I checked the source text (it&#39;s in <i>The Peoples of Middle-earth</i>) this morning, and nobody uses Ambarussa as a plural. It sounds like one, because it sounds like a <i>Latin</i> plural - quanta, millennia - but Quenya nouns form plurals in -r or -i. No Noldo would look at &#39;Ambarussa&#39; and think it was plural. Which is a shame, because I really like thinking of them as it collectively. You could probably use it if you&#39;re writing them very similar to each other, as a &#39;it doesn&#39;t matter which one you mean&#39;. (You could also definitely say &#39;Ambarussar&#39; or &#39;Ambarussat&#39;, the plural and dual forms respectively.)<br><br>It is definitely a valid name for both twins. It&#39;s an interesting fact that only one of Feanor&#39;s children uses the name his father gave him; all the others use their mother-names (except Maedhros, who combined it with an aftername). So Ambarussa (hah) would have used that name. They definitely used it of each other. Amrod may have gone by Ambarto in Quenya (the name Feanor changed Nerdanel&#39;s suggestion to); he would probably <i>not</i> have used Umbarto, &#39;the Doomed One&#39;.<br><br>Per Tolkien Gateway, quoting from one of the Tolkien journals (which I don&#39;t have access to): <i>Others most often called [Amrod] Atyarussa, which means &quot;Second-russa&quot;</i><br><br>All of this of course applies in Beleriand as well as Aman - the Sons of Feanor spoke Quenya in their own realms, ignoring Thingol&#39;s edict. Which invites the intriguing question of whether &#39;Maedhros&#39; went by Matimo, Russandol, or a compound such as Maitrus...<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Curse you, sons of Feanor! Curse you and your little-used names!<br><br>The naming conventions in the house of Finwe are hilarious, actually. Finwe named all three of his sons after himself - literally, he called them all &#39;Finwe&#39; - and only later added modifiers (&#39;crafty&#39;, &#39;wise&#39;, and &#39;noble&#39;). (Curu)Finwe Feanaro named all <i>his</i> sons [modifier]Finwe, and gave one of them - Curufinwe - his own name in full. Nolofinwe slapped his fathers name onto the front of his own to look more kingly; Finrod&#39;s branch responded by sticking a &#39;Finwe&#39; onto the beginning of <i>their</i> father&#39;s Sindarin name too... throw in the fact that all three of Finwe&#39;s sons had way more children than usual, and the fact that some of their kids ended up with names like &#39;Noble lady&#39; (uh, no duh), and you get a real picture for just how messed up House Finwe is.<br><br>(And the first daughter of Finwe and Indis was...

            <p>Specifically, I know they modify an agent&#39;s physiology, but to what extent? Specifically, would they modify, or possibly regenerate, damaged nervous tissue?

            <p>The disguise generator directly maps each part of your body to part of the disguise. So, for instance, the lower-rear portion of an Entwife disguise was mapped to Acacia&#39;s buttock, and the arrow stayed in &#39;the same location&#39; when she took it off.<br><br>This explains why regenerations take away your ability to change back: a regeneration changes every cell in your body, so the mapping suddenly makes no sense. Either your body is no longer mapped to <i>anything</i>, or all the correspondences are scrambled. The former would make it impossible to take the disguise off; the latter would reduce you to a puddle of goo if you did.<br><br>But the mapping clearly doesn&#39;t require you to have a similar body-part to map to: you could disguise as a spider without having eight limbs. If, say, you had a missing hand, a disguise could give you it back (presumably mapping to the end of your wrist) and make it fully functional - for as long as you have the disguise on. Same goes for nerve tissue.<br><br>So that&#39;s my theory: a disguise is a full conversion, and can give you anything you please.<br><br>hS</p>

Well mortal practitioners of magic.<br>Being able to use magic is something theoretically genetic in the Dresdenverse, but there is also the example of a body-snatching warlock who could use magic, even when she had new bodies who should not be able to use magic, and one of her victim who survived in a new body could always use magic, although she was really much weaker.<br>Does this mean that a practitioner would always be able to use it powers in an other body, although there would be a serious downgrade?<br>And there is the problem of the Walking Techbane too. How well would the DORKS, a really advanced piece of technology, fare around peoples who are screwing technology around them, and that the most advanced techs are the first casualties to this effect?</p>

            <p>Agents who disguised as Dresdenverse wizards probably wouldn&#39;t be able to do very much with their magical talent. Theoretically capable of using magic, they would still have to do the studying required to channel it properly.<br><br>It&#39;s kind of like how, if you disguise as a scientist, you don&#39;t automatically know science, even if you are smart enough to learn it.<br><br>On the bright side, this does mean the walking-techbane effect isn&#39;t as strong. The stronger the wizard, the more unreliable technology is for them. But disguising as any kind of walking techbane is probably just tempting the Ironic Overpower as it is.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m not especially familiar with the Dresdenverse, despite making a joke about it in Wobbles&#39;s backstory.

            <p>Would a downgrade to a &#39;standard&#39; sorceress be enough? Magic could still be used with a relatively wide spectrum, no access to really critical knowledge, the glitterbags could easily be stronger, and I could keep some aspects I would like to play with, like the tech potentially failing around, the Sight, the matter of the Laws, the extended lifespan with vanilla friends...<br><br>I don&#39;t want to write some unstoppable juggernaut, and the books make it clear that magic isn&#39;t the panacea. Besides, Dresdenverse practitioners need foci and some material for pulling the really bigs fireworks, and the way I&#39;m going, the only item she kept is a coat enchanted for additional protection if things go really pear-shaped, and it only works for a short moment. And thaumaturgy won&#39;t help without a long preparation and samples of the target.<br><br>Going Suvian is the last thing I want, but I didn&#39;t think it could be seen like this. All in all, I saw other characters more powerful with magic, and I thought they worked fine, like William Grey for instance. Let me know if you think I should definitely scrap this idea.</p>

            <p>What if you had a high-powered agent, but matched them up only with high-powered Sues?<br><br>I know we haven&#39;t used ESAS for a while, but it seems like a good place for a council-level Dresdenverse wizard. They&#39;re sent missions in high-power continua only, where the average power level matches theirs, and most ESAS agents are high-powered themselves.<br><br>Pros:<br>-You wouldn&#39;t have to depower your agent to challenge them.<br>-Your agent on mission would be average in a world that&#39;s high-powered, rather than high-powered in a world that&#39;s average.<br>-The Dresdeverse wizard&#39;s power relies very much on preparation and study, which means that the high-powered Suvians would still be able to catch your character off-guard, whereupon they would have to scramble to survive.<br>-Harry Dresden is a high-powered character in a high-powered world, so the conventions of the stories wouldn&#39;t have to change much.<br><br>Cons:<br>-There would be fewer missions available. ESAS only gets sent high-powered stuff; if there aren&#39;t any giant mechs, superheroes, demigods, etc., then you might find your agent idle for some time. (But high-power doesn&#39;t necessarily mean &quot;difficult for the agents&quot;. That Autobot-Sue may still be so poorly written that she stands there like a dope while you blow her up with RPGs.)<br>-You would still face the difficulty of writing a high-powered character without the glitter. Power level in and of itself doesn&#39;t confer glitter, but it does get harder to write properly.<br>-Your character&#39;s intended partner might not be qualified for ESAS work, and you&#39;d have to deal with that somehow--either re-partner them, or deal with a low-power character in a high-power world.</p>

            <p>Resurrecting one Department for the sake of one character feels a bit too much Speshul Sueflake for me, and I don&#39;t really like the idea of limiting potentials missions. <br>Besides, I must admit that I&#39;m thinking about going the World One avatar way for my second agent, and I&#39;m hesitating between Floaters and Mary Sues, Freelance Division for them.<br><br>Let&#39;s say I&#39;m going the way I said in my precedent post, with a sorceress who isn&#39;t council-level, but could take out the average vampire if it wants to drink her blood/life force, that I&#39;m dropping her in HQ without foci and without magic supplies, meaning that would take her a long time for packing really nasty stuff, would she alright for the average DMS mission?<br>I don&#39;t mind depowering the character if it&#39;s necessary, but I hope I can keep the concept. If it doesn&#39;t work, I&#39;ll keep the character, but switch her to something else.<br><br>Last point, I said council-level, but I was thinking along the lines of a SF Harry, not the crazy awesome badass that almost killed Nicodemus three times, or accomplished his first assignment as Warden riding a zombie T-Rex. The character is in her mid-twenties and the beginning of her career, but if you think that&#39;s too much power...<br><br>Sorry if I&#39;m dragging along this subject, or if I&#39;m irritating you with these questions and propositions, but I don&#39;t want to create someone who won&#39;t fit in the PPC.

            <p>Harry&#39;s what, fifty-some? Older? And he had Training From Hell, too.<br><br>Even if your character matches Harry Dresden in raw power, she&#39;s got less than half the experience. She&#39;d be closer to Molly Carpenter than Dresden. Pre-Changes Molly, even.<br><br>She wouldn&#39;t have advantages like Bob (for knowledge), Mouse (as an early-warning system), the Nevernever (for escape/travel), or even a convenient model of Chicago. She also wouldn&#39;t be able to control her magic very well; remember how hard it was for Molly to learn control?<br><br>Your character would be like a sixteen-year-old with a new driver&#39;s license, behind the wheel of an elite race car. She has the power, but not the knowledge or the experience, and unlike a Sue, she has to gain them the hard way. She&#39;d do the magical equivalent of poking along at 10 mph and stalling out because she couldn&#39;t figure out the manual transmission--sure, the potential&#39;s there, but right now, that&#39;s all it is, and it might even be a drawback because powerful magic is harder to handle than weaker, just like that race car is harder to learn to drive on than a poky Honda Civic with an automatic transmission.<br><br>I do wonder how a Dresdenverse wizard would develop their talents at high-tech HQ, without access to many other Dresdenverse magical practitioners (and thus not to very much relevant knowledge), but with access to the knowledge of a thousand worlds, all with different rules. I think such a person would eventually begin to develop a theory of the multiverse and the rules of Plot.</p>

            <p>But yeah, Training From Hell indeed, and he&#39;s supposed to have a raw power level who could lead him to the Senior Council someday.<br><br>The age I&#39;m using here was based upon SF Dresden and Changes-Ghost Story Molly for the very reason of keeping overpowering out.

            <p>I like the idea of a character who really doesn&#39;t have a lot of raw power to use in the field--maybe a basic shield or a basic attack, but nothing more powerful than bulletproof glass or a handgun would be--whose real strength lies in crafting objects. Dresden has a few enchanted items that help him out, but of course he also has raw power, enough of it that his crafting really only has to serve as a channel for his power. If your character is like a magical version of a techie, that could be quite interesting.<br><br>What I&#39;ve noticed about Dresdenverse magic is that its efficacy is often quite dependent on what you&#39;re targeting with it, thus the knowledge-is-power aspect. Knowing your enemy is basically required for defeating them. Your character would have to know the canons inside and out if she wanted to create enchanted objects that will help her defeat the Sues. Magic probably changes depending on where you are, too. If it can be different depending on your Dresdenverse location (i.e., ley lines), and different depending on the culture where it&#39;s used (the walking techbane effect is largely a modern phenomenon)... then it can certainly be different depending on which continuum you&#39;re in.<br><br>Yes. Sues are soulless, and the first law doesn&#39;t protect them, no matter how human they look, any more than it would protect a White Court vampire. But say your agent kills a human anyway; how would the Council track them down? It&#39;s unlikely that the Council knows about the PPC. On the other hand, your agent would probably know better than to attract their attention to her activities, because the Council (or anyone in Dresdenverse) knowing about the PPC would be asking for trouble.<br><br>Soulgazes, by the way. Avoid them. If your wizard agent ever looks anyone in the eye, they get to know that other person, and the other person knows them, in great detail. And that detail can&#39;t be forgotten. Neuralyzers would be useless. If she ever ends up exchanging a soulgaze with a canon, she&#39;s automatically given that character unerasable knowledge of the PPC.<br><br>Regarding minis: I don&#39;t think Mouse is a good Dresdenverse mini because Mouse isn&#39;t an antagonist, or a monster; he&#39;s just a big dog with Spidey Sense and unusual intelligence. We already have Sparklewolves and Puppies of Baskerville, so keeping the dog-type minis down would be a good thing.<br><br>I don&#39;t really have a good idea for the mini, but some possibilities:<br>-Demons. Come in multiple types, shapes, etc., which can be varied according to which name got misspelled.<br>-Skinwalkers. Creepy, yes--but it&#39;s Balrog-level powerful and definitely a monstrous villain. Its shapechanging power might make for good comedy.<br>-Fey creatures--maybe Gruffs, or various members of the Wild Hunt.<br>-Ghosts. Not quite villains, but they are echoes created by violent deaths. Maybe they could be created by plot holes, too; if Harry Dresden can create his own ghost via almost-a-plot-hole resuscitation...<br><br>Anyway, if you find the first Dresdenverse mini, it&#39;s really up to you, but I really think you should get creative; Mouse is wonderful, I love Mouse, we all love Mouse, but another dog mini would be a bit repetitive.</p>

            <p>Like I said, I&#39;m using an old DF RPG character as a basis, and I found the idea of someone who had a knack for crafting enchanted objects and potions was interesting. She had decent firepower with evocations, but the objects were packing more power, even with foci.<br><br>So, a stalagmite or gravity can crush the glitterbag? Good. However, I&#39;m more worried about the effect that lawbreaking has on the soul that the Wardens. Heck, dropping a Sue lawbreaker in the Wardens&#39; Panic Room in Edinburgh would be so funny to watch.<br><br>Yeah, I know about the soulgaze, dangerous stuff here. However, I think that using the Sight on Sues could be bad too. I don&#39;t want to imagine their &quot;true form&quot;; sure it would be brain-wrecking... so perfect for an unsuspicious Agent.<br><br>For the mini, what about a Pixie like Toot-Toot, it could fill the bill, right? Za Lord Guards for everyone!<br><br>Thanks again for the answers; I&#39;ll put them to good use.</p>

            <p>Not really. Luccio wasn&#39;t sure that she&#39;d ever be able to make her swords again, because she was out of the body that specialized in that power, it wasn&#39;t just a matter of being weaker. <br><br>In addition, that was &#39;&#39;still&#39;&#39; a Dresdenverse body.

            <p>While it is theoretically genetic in the Dresdenverse, what I understand from what I&#39;ve read (I haven&#39;t read the whole series yet, but know bits and bobs- heh- from elsewhere) is that it&#39;s a bit more &#39;sticky&#39; than just straight genetics, given the roles that certain characters end up landing themselves into despite the fact that at series start/their introduction it doesn&#39;t seem like they&#39;d be able to do such at all. <br><br>The DORKS and disguise generators are just that: disguises; which, to me implies that they&#39;re more overlaps than a *complete* transformation- there&#39;s multiple bits of different PPC canon that tend to back this up, from the whole &#39;now I&#39;m a Time Lord&#39; deal a few agents have to the whole &#39;there is an arrow stuck in me what now&#39; issue waaay back in TOS. <br><br>Personally, I can see it being able to work <i>on</i> a character who does screw up technology just by existing around it, unless it just doesn&#39;t work at all. After all, it&#39;s all tech from the Department of <i>Sufficiently Advanced</i> Technology. Things are... usually ensured to work, except in the case that it doesn&#39;t. You can make an argument for this proposed agent that it could or could not work, whichever direction you want to take. Or even that it works sporadically. After all, the important thing is that you get something that you think would be amusing out of it, or would result in an outcome that you would want, in this particular case. <br><br>As long as you can <i>rationalize</i> it to some extent, that&#39;s the important thing. </p>

(hS, I would especially like your feedback on this point.)<br><br>Finally, for those of you who actually participated: if there are any edits you&#39;d like me to make to your sections of the narrative, let me know.<br><br>—doctorlit actually has an entire story in mind for what Vania did during this, but can&#39;t reveal it yet because of spoilers.</p>

            <p>Since I&#39;ve already used all the colors that looked remotely readable to me on my archive site&#39;s background, I think the best solution is going to be hosting the actual RP content on Google Docs.  That way, the colors will all be on white background, and hopefully more visible as a result.<br><br>(Also, yes, good job, you all figured out I used the hardest-to-read color for my own part.  I&#39;m not doing this to toot my own horn, okay?)<br><br>hS (and anyone else color-blind that I&#39;m not aware of):  Augh.  I can&#39;t believe I put the red and green ones right next to each other.  I apologize for the flagrant stupidity there.  I can move the colors around so the similar ones don&#39;t appear in the same scene, but do you have any suggestions for different colors  I could substitute to make all the parts more easily discernible?  I know, as hS pointed out, it&#39;s generally easy enough to tell who wrote what, but I&#39;d still like to make the crediting of the writing as <s>anal-retentive</s> explicit as possible.  If possible.<br><br>—doctorlit actually loathes Google Docs because of how unprofessional it looks, but keeps finding himself using it anyway because of how darn useful it is.</p>

            <p>The only one I found difficult to read was doctorlit.  The light blue just does not provide enough contrast.  The others for me were tolerable, though I would say that LunarHuntress gets a bit difficult to read.  You might want to consider changing Lily Winterwood as well.  Seeing as that color is very similar to the background I got.  </p>

            <p>Mission 1: Agent :-) is relaxing with a book. BEEEEEEP! Oh, a Suefic. Sue seduces canon, who seems to grow an extra head... Agent :-) uses the Book of Canon to knock out the canon, then cuts off the Sue&#39;s head with scissors. Yay, back to relaxing with books. BEEEEEP! Oh no, have to go see the Flowers.<br>Mission 2: Is that the Sunflower Official transferring :-) to Bad Slash? Hm. Oh well. Back to internets... BEEEEEP! OMG, femslash! Canons giving each other gifts, fine. Wait what. Are they... flirting? Uh. I really don&#39;t want to see this! Time for the Book of Canon again! Boom, exorcised. Time for fun again! Except... dammit, have to see the Flowers again.<br>Mission 3: Off to the Bonsai Mallorn (seriously, why is the Sunflower Official doing Sod&#39;s job?) Canon loves hospital, canon loves mountain. Uh-oh, there&#39;s a tidal wave! Oh, okay, Castiel&#39;s saved the day! Thank you, Cas! Let&#39;s go to a desert island! This makes :-) very cross, so he burns all the non-canon locations to the ground. :-) is getting stressed by his sucky job - even internets can&#39;t cheer him up. And then... Sigh. Back to see the Flowers.<br>Mission 4: SO sends :-) to Admiral Pansy (thanks for the hint, hS). Back to the RC... BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEP!!!!!!! Okay, Bad Parody. Yay, the canons are in love. Wait, what. Monkeys? Canons and Agent :-) are sad. And now there&#39;s an alien, which causes the canons to split up? Yeah, so Agent :-) blows up the monkeys and alien, so they go up in flames! Back to the RC. Then, well, back to see the SO...<br><br>(how did i do do i get a prize)</p>

            <p>Your monitor might be less bright, too. Which is another really good reason to get feedback about this sort of thing.

            <p>So, basically, a hexadecimal color is composed of three hues: Red, Green, and Blue. Each hue is assigned a value between 00 and FF, where 00 is darkest and FF is brightest. #FF0000 is pure bright red, #00FF00 is pure bright green, and #0000FF is pure bright blue. If R, G, and B are all 00 (#000000), you get black; if they&#39;re all FF (#FFFFFF), you get white. If they all have an equal value somewhere in between, you get a shade of gray. By mixing them up, you get different colors.<br><br>Counting in hexadecimal goes like this: 00, 01, 02, 03, 04, 05, 06, 07, 08, 09, 0A, 0B, 0C, 0D, 0E, 0F, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 1A, 1B, 1C, 1D, 1E, 1F, 20, etc.<br><br>So, #FF0000 is the brightest possible shade of red. If I want to make it just a hair darker, I can lower the value to #FE0000; this results in a barely discernible difference. Dropping a whole tens-place to #EF0000 is a much bigger change—a difference of sixteen, if I&#39;m not much mistaken.<br><br>To darken a more complicated color, you just have to reduce all three hues by the same amount. So, say I&#39;ve got Light Salmon: #FFA07A. The least I can darken it gives me #FE9F79. That&#39;s hardly a difference at all, so maybe I&#39;ll try reducing the brightness by five and come up with #FA9B75. But heck, that&#39;s still pretty light. Let&#39;s go as far as we can while still keeping the hue somewhat recognizable: #852600. That&#39;s as far as it can go because Blue is at its lowest possible value. If I change the others at this point, they won&#39;t retain the same balance.<br><br>And if that makes any sense at all, you can now alter any hex value you like with total precision. {= D But I&#39;m not convinced I&#39;m not rambling incoherently, so let me know if I can clarify anything.<br><br>Fun fact: hex colors are made of light, not pigment, so mixing them doesn&#39;t work the way it does with paints. Since the three primary hues are Red, Blue, and Green, the secondaries are as follows:<br><br>Red + Green = Yellow<br>Red + Blue = Magenta<br>Green + Blue = Cyan<br><br>That may or may not be helpful, but it&#39;s kinda fun. {= )<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Hi there! I see from your response to Des that we both like Yugioh and Harry Potter. What are you favorite goodfics from those fandoms?<br><br>Have a Rorschach Book, which can change into virtually any written text in existence. It works kind of like the Room of Requirement. Basically, you hold while having your eyes closed, think about what you wanna read and then blink on purpose three times.</p>

            <p>For Yugioh, my absolute favorite is <a href="http://www.pojo.biz/board/showthread.php?t=460092">Battle Zone</a>. The duels are really well written and properly described, specially the Monster cards. You can pretty much always picture the action as if you were actually watching the duel. <br><br>It&#39;s technically GX, but only in the sense that the beginning of the first arc takes place at the end of the protagonists&#39; Third Year. After that the action pretty much takes place in tournaments and things like that. And also some arcs involving Haou, but that&#39;s it. <br><br>Aren&#39;t there any HP fics that you like?<br><br>As for your question, I don&#39;t know. Best not to try it.</p>

            <p>My favorite HP fics are <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4200568/1/The-Harmony-Bond">The Harmony Bond</a>, <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3743518/1/Tragedy">Tragedy</a>, <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2636963/1/Harry_Potter_and_the_Nightmares_of_Futures_Past">Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Future’s Past</a> and <a href="http://www.fanfiction.mugglenet.com/viewstory.php?sid=79611">Marissa and the Wizards </a>. <br><br>Harmony Bond and Tragedy are Harmony shipfics, so if you can&#39;t stand the pairing, it&#39;s likely that you won&#39;t like them all that much.<br><br>Nightmares of Futures Past is one of those AU fics where Harry goes back in back to fix things. It works better than most because we get to see him struggle with his morals when he has to prepare his friends for what&#39;s come while feeling guilty about doing it, feeling like he is manipulating them and that they will hate him when the truth comes out. He also has to balance wanting to change things for the better and trying keep his knowledge from future relevant. <br><br>I love Marissa and the Wizards in great part because it&#39;s about a Wizarding School set in my very own country, Brazil. Witness Stone comes across as unique and very different from Hogwarts, from how students are sorted into the Houses to how the fantastical creature that live there are based in local folklore.<br><br></p>

Blue Flame Candle) from <i>The Binding Of Isaac: Rebirth</i>!<br><br>The Candle is a very, very good item: every time you use a non-contact move, you make an additional 60BP Fire-type Special attack with a 20% chance to Burn the target, and it&#39;s affected by any and all abilities. However, it&#39;s not a particularly brilliant fit for Diglett. While it works well with Earthquake and can do additional chip damage, the problem is that Diglett is a Pokйmon geared towards taking out very specific threats in the Little Cup meta, which is basically Chinchou. Diglett&#39;s Special Attack is also straight-up garbage, so even if you invest in full Special Attack (and frankly there&#39;s no reason why you would) then you&#39;re not going to be able to kill stuff off with Candle damage alone. Sorry. Both &#39;mon and item are good, they just... don&#39;t go great together. =]</p>

            <p>Just one thing though. Would you advice me to start from scratch for the prompts this time around? Otherwise, it is still the same docs you already have acess to. <br><br>I&#39;m already trying to clean up most of the issues Iximaz pointed. And I could really use some help with fleshing out Aiko&#39;s personality since she also pointed that hers is a bit shallow at the moment, so at very least, I would ask to take you to another look at the agents doc.</p>

            <p>I have a couple of missions to MLP badfic lined up; the first is a fairly run-of-the-mill Luna replacement, while the second is... 120 Days Of Blueblood. If you don&#39;t know what this is, <b>treasure your ignorance</b>. The problem I have is that I haven&#39;t really kept up with the show; while this isn&#39;t a problem for the two fics, since they were there while I was very active in the fandom (this, for new Internetists, was before it became the preserve of nasty little fedora-brandishing human yeast infections) and I do remember what went on in Series 1 and 2, buuuuut I do think it&#39;d be really handy to work with someone who&#39;s a bit more <i>au courant</i> with the show. Drop me an email at harry heath 99 at that place where the mail is hot if you&#39;re interested in helping out.</p>

            <p>Hi, PPC members. Just trying to clarify - should an agent on a mission find out he needs some info on the setting&#39;s in-depth history, which department would he request it from? DoI? DMSE&amp;R? Or would he rather have a cell&#39;s tactical coordiantor being a friendly-voice-on-the-radio from the response center?</p>

            <p>Welcome, etc. (Tired. Someone else will probably ask the usual questions.)<br><br>Unless it&#39;s being done for comedic effect, agents know the canon they are being sent to. As a rule of thumb, in every agent team there is at least one agents that knows the canon(s) involved — if, for example, Lacksi and Macksi get sent into a <i>Star Wars</i> x <i>Star Trek</i> fic, then if Lacksi doesn&#39;t know SW, Macksi does and vice versa. Alternatively, <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Pocket_Fictionary">the Pocket Fictionary</a> is a thing. It is also popular to have agents contact friends, acquaintances or just random persons for help if they get a mission to a canon they don&#39;t know.<br><br>Also, question (might be on the paranoid side. Again, tired, apologies if I&#39;m reading things into your post or offending — definitely not my aim here): you&#39;re not planning on writing PPC missions without <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Permission">Permission</a>, are you now?<br><br>~A very tired law student</p>

            <p>Generally, the PPC agents are canon experts who are good at figuring out what can and can&#39;t work. However, there are exceptions: the best thing to do is make it funny.

            <p>Alright, this requires a bit of backstory. My friend and I are doing NaNoWriMo together, and she had the idea of having a mini-RP of our new characters. It turned into a Halloween masquerade, and then I suggested the PPC, and it went from there (I&#39;ve told her about the PPC before; she likes the idea, but probably won&#39;t join).<br><br>So here&#39;s the RP: It will last three days, from October 30th to November 1st; no Permission required; and it will be set in a large dance hall in New Caledonia. My friend and I will run it (we&#39;ll have a bit of a structure going: new courses arriving, a costume contest, things like that), and here&#39;s the fun part: it&#39;s not restricted to PPC characters! It began with our wanting to try out our OCs for NaNoWriMo, so all original characters are allowed. We&#39;re still working on an explanation that makes sense in-universe: suggestions for that are welcome. <br><br>So, Boarders: What do you think? Will any of you attend the Halloween Masquerade? <br><br>-Alleb</p>
