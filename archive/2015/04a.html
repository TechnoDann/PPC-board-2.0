            <p>I was surprised at the cinematography. While clearly armature, it was surprisingly well done. There were a few funky shots, like at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQoA_wjmE9w">1:04</a> or that super strong dutch angle at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pc0mxOXbWIU">1:35</a> Otherwise, very well done!<br><br>Also, was it you singing? Because, if so, wow. I had no idea you could sing like that! I would recommend getting a better microphone, though. Perhaps a <a href="http://static.fjcdn.com/pictures/Angry_5a4dce_2836232.jpg">Blue Snowball?</a> Just a possibility.<br><br>Otherwise, congratulations!<br><br>...Are they gone?<br><br>I think they&#39;re gone.<br><br>I KNEW IT! Come on, girl. I am like the rickroll KING! I have not been legitimately rickrolled in over a year! COme on girl. You can do better then that.<br><br>If you want to get people, give them something other then a rickroll. Today, <i>everybody</i> is seeing that coming. Link them to something like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZ5LpwO-An4">this</a> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsIa_LKojJI">this</a> or possibly even <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ">this.</a> Just some notes for when you want to troll people in the future. :)</p>

            <p>I took a full year&#39;s worth of film classes, so I tend to notice these things. Say, perhaps for the next video, I could help with the editing! I have some experience in Premier, I might be able to add some basic effects to improve the quality just that much more.<br><br>Too expencive? I picked up my snowball for, like, $100 or something. Not all too expencive. Still, what mother says, goes.<br><br>Right, that should do it.<br><br>Aw, there there. If it makes you feel better, I went though most of that thought pattern. I&#39;m just so cynical because of the Internet. I don&#39;t trust any link, expecialy today. <br><br>Listen, only one of my links is a rickroll, and even then, not a proper one! I&#39;ll even tell you which one: the very first one. It&#39;s a Darude Sandstorm, rickroll remx that&#39;s basically  the trap video to end all trap videos. And not the music trap. Come on, man, I put some funny jokes in those links. Please?</p>

            <p>... a brief biography of a certain Jaycacia Thornbyrd. It... well, it&#39;s... honestly, I think it has to be read to be believed.<br><br><hr>
<br><br>The daughter of Acacia Byrd and PPC HQ, she was borne by Jay Thorntree due to Luxury&#39;s Black Magickckck. She was raised as Jay and Acacia&#39;s daughter, and became immensely popular in HQ. She married the Sunflower Official in secret, and is also known to have slept with Jay.<br><br>Jaycacia was murdered by unknown villains, but a year after her funeral was restored to life by the love between Jay and the SO. During a threesome with them, she was attacked by Acacia Byrd, who she managed to kill in a love-powered magical duel.<br><br>The defeat of Acacia was commemorated by naming the date as the first of Jaycaciamonth. Some years later, Jaycacia, Jay, and the SO went on holiday on that date. While out in the woods, they were ambushed by the Department of Intelligence, led by the Sub Rosa herself.<br><br>Jaycacia went to the Board of Flowers and asked them to transform her into the Starflower. She used that power to defeat another attack by the Spies, and to carry the Sub Rosa, Tiger Lily, and Architeuthis back to the beginning of the universe.<br><br>Jaycacia returned years later, summoned from the Rift by Dafydd Illian. She was restored to her human form, and engaged in an orgy with multiple other agents. By the power of Luxury&#39;s Black Magickckck, she became pregnant with a baby who had a high destiny...<br><br><hr>
<br><br>As of yesterday, there are nine stories in the Jaycaciaverse - seven by me, and two by <s>Neshomeh</s> brandy<em>baby. Terrifyingly, they actually form a single coherent narrative (though there&#39;s no explanation at present as to how the Marquis can &#39;live happily ever after&#39; and then get set on fire by the Department of Intelligence). Doubtless there will be more to her tale when September rolls around...<br><br>(Well, I say there&#39;s nine stories. If anyone knows of any I haven&#39;t thought of - which is the five Jaycacia stories by &lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://fanfic">http://fanfic</a></em>land.webs.com/FfW/AuthorJayBird.htm&quot;&gt;JayBird</a>, &#39;Love and Secrets&#39; by JayBird, both of <a href="http://fanfic_land.webs.com/FfW/Authorbrandywine_baby89.htm">brandy_baby&#39;s stories</a>, and this AFD mission - please let me know! Anything which mentions Jaycacia as a real person, Agent Aurora, Dafydd-Ilraen-AW being one person, or any of the other minor facts of the Jaycaciaverse, is fair game to be incorporated)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>What with all the interludes and missions being posted lately, I thought I&#39;d jump on the bandwagon. This is a short interlude which takes a popular fanfic trope and applies it to the PPC. To that end, if anyone would like to expand upon the idea, or have an rp based on it (Karen thinks it&#39;d work well as one), you&#39;re quite welcome to.<br><br>Yup. I wrote a PPC coffeeshop AU (I suspect it&#39;s the first, though I&#39;d be happy to be proved wrong). It&#39;s not quite coffee, nor is it heavy on the romance aspect, but I like the result. <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pnegAqyLC0mKqux-Lj-FJEOTuPESsE1P8MgpynP0zmQ/edit?usp=docslist_api">I hope you do too!</a><br><br>~DF</p>

            <p>You know, I never played any of the Pokemon games. I feel like I should fix that. This gen may actually be the one I pick up! I always hear about how amazing gen 1 is, so to be able to play it on a device I already own would be great! I mean, I know emulation is a thing, but having the updated console and graphics would make the experience so much better. Still, I&#39;m going to be a reasonable consumer, and wait until I can read some reviews. Perhaps when TotalBiscuit gets his hands on it, I&#39;ll see if it&#39;s worth it. Still, I&#39;m optimistic!<br><br>And, in other news, SeaTurtle either makes fakes or found some on the internet. Do you really expect me to believe that? Especially when you say it was announced by Nintendo? The <i>least</i> you could have done is say they were leaks. Without an official (or faked) statement from Nintendo, I have no reason to believe any of these images. I r8 2/8, not gr8 b8 m8.</p>

            <p>That it is not true.  Pretty sure the first looked like it was from HeartGold/SoulSilver, the last two were from different generations.  And they already made remakes of the First Generation.  I would imagine I imagine Ruby/Sapphire/Emerald would get remakes first.</p>

            <p>I didn&#39;t even notice that.  Then I guess the next logical one would be a remake of Pearl/Diamond.  Those are next in line.  Because the Third in the generation usually do not get remade.  Z might be next.  I would almost like to see a slightly different format than the standard, instead of starting Fire/Grass/Water maybe going with a Dark/Fighting/Psychic.  Might be nice to add a bit of variety into it.<br><br>Or maybe a remake of Yellow.  Giving the player the ability to travel through all the regions?  That might be kind of interesting.</p>

            <p>It&#39;s highly unlikely that there&#39;ll be a game with the starting trio being Dark/Fighting/Psychic, Psychic does no damage to dark, rather than being not-very-effective, if they do stray from the traditional set up, it&#39;s more likely to be Fighting/Steel/Fairy or something like that.</p>

            <p>Would be dealing with the 2x weakness and Dragonite&#39;s hefty attack.  Personally though my choice would be Haxorus plus Dragon Fang plus Outrage.  That tears through nearly anything pretty quickly.  At least as of B/W.</p>

            <p>Everyone else feel free to make suggestions! I&#39;m just making a list of what I think we need to consider.<br><br><br>1) Legendaries? There is a reason why they&#39;re banned in competitive play, but this is just a casual thing.<br><br>2) Mega Evolution?<br><br>3) Which games? Not everyone has ORAS, which offers the widest variety of Mega Evos. Obviously not a problem if we disallow Mega Evo, but if we allow Legendary &#39;mons, you could use that Rayquaza from the endgame, never mind Primal Reversion for Groudon/Kyogre.<br><br>4) Randomly assigned brackets to determine battle order?<br><br>5) What do we do if connection cuts in the middle of a battle? Simply restart?<br><br>6) 3DSes have battle recording capabilities. Who else thinks it might be fun to upload the battles for everyone to watch?</p>

            <p>1) I think Legendaries should be okay if Megas are okay. Legendaries are just as susceptible to being out-played as Non-legendaries. But, perhaps we should impose a limit? Maybe one Legendary per team allowed, and no Legendary Megas (those &gt;700 base stats are <i>scary</i>),<br><br>Also, maybe no Rayquaza or Mewtwo. They&#39;ve both been banned to the <a href="http://www.smogon.com/dex/xy/tags/uber">Uber</a> tier in competitive play for a reason. Mega Rayquaza was even so powerful they had to make up a new tier just to ban it there.<br><br>2) I agree with Foofooman here. Megas are a great asset to several of my teams and the amount of new strategic possibilities they create makes them well worth using.<br><br>3) For the sake of being all-inclusive, I would suggest playing on Pokemon Showdown (for those who don&#39;t know, Showdown is Smogon&#39;s online Pokemon battle simulator). It&#39;s noticeably less pretty than the official games, but this way anyone can play, whether they&#39;ve got a 3DS or not. We can even play with special rules or matches in generations all the way back to Gen 1. Plus, everyone can use Pokemon at the same level with ideal stats and ablities, no grinding necessary. There&#39;s even an in-built tournament functionality.<br><br>4) We could maybe have an unbiased party (an official tournament judge?) to determine match-ups for all the players. If not, I see no issue with randomization.<br><br>5) If we were to use Showdown, we&#39;d not have to worry too much about connection cuts, which are rare (lag is a different story). But in the event that one does occur, perhaps we leave it to the judgement of the players or observers, if any are present?<br><br>6) Showdown also allows you to share replays of battles, complete with handy links that we can just copy and paste anywhere we like. Before that, though, anyone with the link to the battle can watch it as it happens, but if we&#39;re to have observers, we&#39;ll need some rules of conduct for them as well, yeah?</p>

            <p>1) No legendaries . With them they take out the need to try to build a balanced team. The have an automatic 3 perfect IVs and the highest stats in the game. They&#39;re really cheep and it doesn&#39;t show off what kind of a Pokemon trainer you are.<br><br>2) Yes to mega evolution. As of 6th ten it has become a part of the game. It gives the game more strategy and everyone would be able to use it if they choose to. <br><br>3) Any game from 6th gen. Definitely the best generation for competitive gameplay. As for which games you can still interact between them all. ORAS would only have an advantage if you never trade Pokemon. <br><br>4) How else would we do it?<br><br>5) Reatarting would be the easiest way. It would be to difficult to get the battle to where it was when the connection got cut.<br><br>6) Could be fun. Would we post the videos after each game or after the tournament? After the games would reveal your moves/strategies.<br><br>7) Single or double elimination?</p>

Some of your methods just don’t work for me. I considered writing a scene at several points, but it always felt like a distraction from tasks that were more important at the time, not like it would help in any way. And if I tried to do it now, I wouldn’t bear leaving it unfinished and would end with writing the whole mission. But I don’t totally dismiss the idea. One example is not enough; it may work better with differently structured badfics, so I may try it again. <br><br>On the other hand, this outline is much more detailed then your example (actually longer than the badfic) and I may already have done half of Workshop 4B. Partially is this due to an attempt to make my notes understandable for others than myself. But I also realized that writing everything down helped me to clarify my thoughts, and to see aspects I would have missed if I had tried to keep it all in my head. I will keep doing this, although future outlines will probably be shorter and less comprehensible.<br><br>I also realized that writing directly into a copy of the badfic may be better to pinpoint where the agents’ actions go. But then, with longer badfics and shorter notes, there might be too much badfic between notes. Again, one example is not enough. I may need to do some experimantation.<br><br>HG</p>

            <p>First off, I apologize that it took me so long to respond. I&#39;ve been busy as of late.<br><br>I&#39;m glad you were able to take some lessons from this exercise, even if my suggestions weren&#39;t as helpful as I had hoped. But that&#39;s how it goes. A lot of writing is ultimately subjective; people adopt the strategies that work best for them. I&#39;ve never been a huge fan of the &quot;writing notes into the badfic&quot; technique (which Nesh also mentioned way back when), but I can see how it would work for others.<br><br>Awesome job.

            <p>[commented for the convenience of readers who didn’t live in my head for the last two years; these expositionary comments aren’t actually a part of the real outline I would do if this weren’t for the workshop.]<br><br><b>Pre-mission</b><br>Hieronymus (and Androia’s?) first mission, sequel to <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=252682;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">First Encounter</a> [which should be fleshed-out and ends with a BEEP]; or may start with fleshed-out version of &quot;First Encounter”.<br><br>Wide-eyed &quot;veteran&quot; Androia Avatar [She has the advantage of having been a warrior and healer fighting demons in <i>World of Warcraft</i> before she was snatched out of the game. She may even have gathered some experience in training missions, if I find co-writers for these. But since she never did anything else, she is still trying to figure out what life, free-will and everything is about.]<br><br>Over-confident rookie Hieronymus [He pretends to remember <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=261128;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">everything he read in the archives</a>, and to have seen everything that’s there. But he has no idea how it really feels to leave his reading chair and go on a mission to fight the Mary Sues.]<br><br>Neither is prepared to lead the team. [Androia was not designed to be a team player and she never made an important decision on her own (except joining the PPC, but even then she might have been talked into it). She doesn’t know how to lead. Hieronymus should have seen the reports of her training missions in the archives, where she probably mentioned that she hates the guy who manipulated her whole life in <i>World of Warcraft</i>. If this didn’t happen, he is at least not the jerkass of the badfic games and can imagine (non-capital &quot;i&quot;) how she feels. Anyway, he believes that telling her what she should do would not help to win her trust and that actually only telling her that he is her creator would be worse.] <br><br>BEEP! Hieronymus checks Intelligence report, summarizes the fic’s first paragraph and suggests going in as random inhabitants of Hogsmeade. Androia agrees, programs Disguise Generator.<br><br><b>Mission: Breaking the Loop</b><br>(Numbers in parentheses refer to paragraphs of the badfic.)<br><br>(1)  <b>Decision: Skip, already summarized in pre-mission.</b><br>After the battle of Hogwarts, mourning in the Great Hall. Half-sentence flashback to Hermione kissing Ron, then scene shift to Harry lying on his bed. <ul>
<br><li>I’m not sure how much this will throw the agents around until they realize that this just establishes Harry’s POV and we have seen his thoughts about the situation. [May bring some dynamic into a story mostly located in the dormitory, and Hieronymus’ reaction might be funny. But it doesn’t do much for the rest of the mission. Hieronymus’ first experience with such effects should be saved for another mission.]</li>
</ul>
<br><br>(2 – 5)  <b>Enter the agents. Hide under Dean’s bed.</b><br>Harry and Hermione had left the Great Hall and went to their respective dormitories, but they cannot sleep, so Hermione visits Harry and occupies Ron’s bed. They chat for a while. Just before they doze off, an old woman appears in a bright silver light.  <ul>
<br><li>Hermione should be in the Great Hall with the Weasleys? Actually, the canon chapter ends with Harry, Ron and Hermione in the Headmasters office, Harry contemplating to go to bed, and to ask Kreacher to serve him a sandwich in the dorm. <br>
</li>
<li>H. and H. cannot see the agents arriving, but since &quot;Rose&quot; is a Sue, the agents should hide before she appears. Under a bed across the room from Harry and Ron’s beds? Dean’s bed, identified by the Westham United poster? </li>
</ul>
<br><br>(6 – 9)  <br>The Sue identifies as 143 years old Rose Weasley and claims that she used Hermione’s &quot;notes to get back&quot; in time because she wanted to talk to her parents. <ul>
<br><li>No idea what this means. Did Hermione leave her daughter notes about time travel?<br>
</li>
<li>H. and H. are on the floor (rolled off their beds), wands drawn. Sue sits on Harry’s bed (She may or may not be facing the agent’s hiding place, depending on the layout of the dorm, which has not been described in canon, nor in the badfic. Pottermore, movies(?) and common sense suggest that the beds are arranged with bed-head at the wall of the circular(?) room and foot pointing to centre of room. My attempts to visualize H and H and the Sue’s positions and moves don’t make sense.<br>
</li>
<li>The badfic may suppose that the beds are lined up along the wall, H. and H. rolled off the sides of their respective beds towards the room’s centre, Sue is sitting on the side of Harry’s bed facing the room’s centre, Harry is in front of Sue and Hermione somewhere at his side. This layout doesn’t make much sense, because it doesn’t leave much space for windows, lockers and the like between beds, or it leaves an unnecessarily wide empty space in the centre of an unreasonably big room.<br>
</li>
<li>Actually, in this scenario it would have been better to stay on the beds, just drawing wand, rather than rolling off towards the potential danger (although it’s not entirely clear <b>where</b> the bright silver light appeared). <br>
</li>
<li>The agents may experience a transformation from what they expected to what the badfic supposed, when the word world realizes that common sense is not applicable. [I would try to draw maps, but learning how to post them here is too tedious.] </li>
</ul>
<br><br>(10 – 14) <br>Rose-Sue begins with the Weasley-bashing and claims that Harry is her father. She talks in breathless run-on sentences, and this spills over to the narrative. <ul>
<br><li>Reread check: was the narrative this way from the start? It starts bad and becomes worse.<br>
</li>
<li>How does this affect the agents? No idea, actually. There is not much narrative anyway, and playing with the badly defined  environment is more fun, <br>
</li>
<li>Also, a misspelled Horcrux’s (meant to be plural) may give the agents something to do while they hide under the bed.<br>
</li>
<li>The room may still be a bit twitchy, unsure concerning its size and layout.<br>
</li>
<li>H and H sit now on either side of the Sue on Harry’s bed.<br>
</li>
<li>The agents try to get C-CAD readings, but the C-CAD doesn’t work (explained later). </li>
</ul>
<br><br>(15 – 16) <br>Rose-Sue gets an armchair to sit now facing H and H on the bed, then announces that H and H will not like what she has to say. <ul>
<br><li>She conveniently turns her back to the agents now.<br>
</li>
<li>The word world may decide to fill the room’s empty centre with a table and some assorted chairs never mentioned in canon.<br>
</li>
<li>Since Rose-Sue never turns to look at what’s behind her, the agents may leave their hiding place whenever it’s convenient to intersperse the sporking with some action.<br>
</li>
<li>Hieronymus will definitely prefer to sit at this convenient table while he writes the charge list. </li>
</ul>
<br><br>(17 – 18) I have to quote this:<br>Harry and Hermione turned to look at each other; nodded and then turned back to listen to what Rose had to say.<br><br>&quot;Can you please keep in mind what you just did, that talking with out words...&quot; <ul>
<br><li>Does she imply that Harry and Hermione did this in canon all the time, and that this is a sign of their true love? I thought I know my canon, but I don’t remember a single incident where this happened. (I <b>do</b> remember a scene in the third book where it happened with Harry and Ginny!) Unfortunately the Sue doesn’t quote canon lines I could argue with. Must I now reread the entire seven books to see whether she may have a point somewhere, or can I just charge her with blatantly lying about canon and be right because she doesn’t defend her position? </li>
</ul>
<br><br>(18 – 19) <br>Rose-Sue claims that Harry, after seeing Hermione kissing Ron, was so devastated that he intended to commit suicide by Voldemort, because &quot;he had no more reason to fight&quot;, and somehow she holds the Dursleys responsible for this, because Hermione of all people was too stupid and too un-empathic to understand how badly living with the Dursleys had affected Harry. <ul>
<br><li>Canon check: Harry’s thought’s while he walked to his sacrifice. Agent Hieronymus would love to quote them at the Sue, if he finds the time to do it. <br>
</li>
<li>Alas he won’t. <br>
</li>
<li>Is this the place to joke about this version of Hermione having the emotional range of a tea spoon? </li>
</ul>
<br><br>(20 – 21)<br>Rose-Sue claims that Harry doesn’t know how to show love, and that what he feels for Hermione is love, and that he couldn’t stand being touched by people, except Hermione, whose hand he hold every night while she was petrified. <ul>
<br><li>This didn’t happen in CS, so she <b>is</b> blatantly lying about canon. Harry touched petrified Hermione just once, when he took the piece of parchment out of her hand. </li>
</ul>
<br><br>(22)<br>Rose-Sue is foretelling the future now. &quot;In the not to distant future&quot; Rose will be conceived when Hermione and Harry will realise their &quot;real true love&quot; and promptly have sex. Hermione wrote about it in her journals, but she didn’t reveal what caused the big realisation. Harry asked Hermione to marry him. Also, Harry never asked Ginny, somehow she just pushed him into marriage. <ul>
<br><li>Canon check: how old is Rose in the epilogue. I’m sure she should be conceived several years after the battle of Hogwarts. Since this <b>probably</b> doesn’t qualify as not too distant future, Rose-Sue <b>probably</b> isn’t the canonical Rose. <br>
</li>
<li>Obviously Stupid!Hermione didn’t consider that Ron might read her journal and find out that she slept with Harry. But aren’t you supposed to put your thoughts into your diary, not just a plain description of the day’s events? Why didn’t she say anything about <b>how</b> she and Harry realised their &quot;real true love&quot;? (Because Rose-Sue has no imagination and just wants it to happen, but that’s beside the point.)<br>
</li>
<li>Since we already established that Rose-Sue lies, I suppose that Hermione’s journals say actually nothing about the big realisation, because it will not happen. But since Rose-Sue exists, something must have happened, so the secret that Hermione doesn’t reveal in her journal is probably that she and Harry had sex and Harry asked her to marry him just because a time traveller had told them that this had to happen because it had already happened. <br>
</li>
<li>Also, I have some problems with tenses in these notes. We may need a Time-Lord to sort this out. </li>
</ul>      <br><br>(23) <br>Further foretelling the future, Hermione, following a misguided sense of loyalty and obligation, will disregard her newly discovered &quot;real true love&quot; and marry Ron anyway, because she already promised and doesn’t want to hurt the Weasleys’ feelings. <ul>
<br><li>Being a Gryffindor, Hermione should actually be guided by honour (she’s a sort of knight, right?), and her sense of honour might misguide her in a Victorian way. But I can’t blame her for being stupid here. A time traveller told her that she <b>will</b> marry Ron because it already happened in the future, and Hermione is not as stupid as to temper with history. (Time-Lords, help me!) </li>

        <div class="post-body">
            <p>(24 – 25) <br>Only days after Rose-Sue is born, Ron will start to beat his wife. Twenty years in the future, the Weasleys will do nothing to stop Ron when he beats his wife to death, because, as Molly says it, she’s &quot;just a mudblood and therefore [...] must deserve it&quot;. Harry will try to rescue Hermione and will be stabbed by Rose’s evil half-brother Hugo. The Weasleys will make up a story about Harry and Hermione killing each other. <ul>
<br><li>
<b>Defaming Molly!</b> Androia wants to kill the Sue, but Hieronymus insists that they still can’t be sure that she is a replacement.<br>
</li>
<li>At this point, the agents are certainly not hiding under the bed.<br>
</li>
<li>Is Ron’s wife really Hermione? Why doesn’t she hex him to Tibet? Or at least grab her baby and run away? Oh, I forgot, a time traveller told her that she cannot run away, because then the time traveller’s trajeck past will never have happened.<br>
</li>
<li>Isn’t it telling that this starts as soon as the Sue has forced her way into existence, and is now able to warp everybody out of character?<br>
</li>
<li>She must be a very strong Sue when she could do this while she was still a baby. Her strong Suefluence will certainly make H and H defend her when the agents charge. </li>
</ul>
<br><br>(26) <br>Ginny plans to inherit all of Harry’s wealth and not share it with her kids, so she will cast an sterility charm on Harry before she sleeps with him, and when he is dead, she will send her children, who aren’t Harrys kids, off to their respective fathers. <ul>
<br><li>I don’t understand why Ginny even has kids. Why didn’t she cast a sterility charm on herself?<br>
</li>
<li>Maybe she feared that Harry would want a divorce when she couldn’t give birth.<br>
</li>
<li>But these kids will still inherit her wealth when she dies. Doesn’t she fear that they, having grown up in such a terrible family, will become evil and try to inherit early?<br>
</li>
<li>Am I already writing dialogue for my agents? <br>
</li>
<li>Tune the MSTing down and concentrate on the agents discussing plans to kill the Sue? The democratic decision finding process doesn’t work well and the badfics badness is distracting. </li>
</ul>
<br><br> (27 – 31) <br>Rose-Sue brags about how she crossed the Weasleys’ evil plans as soon as she was of age. Presenting evidence that she is a Potter, and memories of the murders, she had the Weasleys arrested, got the Potter inheritance plus all other Knuts Ginny possessed, burned down the Burrow, and was probably somehow responsible for Hugo being found dead in his cell. Just as an afterthought in midst of this raging revenge, she remembers that she was abused ever since her mother’s death, starting when she was twelve and a half years old. <ul>
<br><li>I hope Evil!Ron had read Stupid!Hermione’s journal and knew that the didn&#39;t – no, scratch this, I&#39;m not going there.  <br>
</li>
<li>Although it’s a good description of the Sue’s hate-full character, I will try to gloss over this section, conveniently ignoring all implications that the Sue was not already of age twenty years in the future, and was actually born about seven years after the Battle of Hogwarts. (But again she cannot be the real Rose Weasley, who is eleven years old at 1 September, Year 17 after Battle of Hogwarts, thus at least fourteen and maybe fifteen years old at 1 January, Year 20 after Battle of Hogwarts.)<br>
</li>
<li> Did Hieronymus bring a weapon, BTW? Why didn’t Androia remind him? One knife (Androia’s) is not enough to keep H and H and the Sue quite while reading the charges. The C-CAD still doesn’t work. Can they trust the neuralyzer? </li>
</ul>
<br><br>(32 – 33)<br>As soon as Rose-Sue has stopped babbling, Harry asks Hermione how one knows that they are in love. Hermione shortly contemplates &quot;to interrogate him later about his treatment at the Dursleys&quot;, and, anticipating to hear about terrible experiences, to pay them a revengeful visit, but then makes Harry answer some other questions. <ul>
<br><li>Really? This is their reaction to the bloody story they just heard? They show no empathy for their abused child?<br>
</li>
<li>It seems unbelievable that Hermione is so clueless about Harry’s family, but since I don’t remember when exactly in canon Harry told her about his experiences with the Dursleys, he may only have told Ron. [Further research required. Reread at least <i>Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone?</i>]<br>
</li>
<li>Is there a way to catch the Sue alone? Portal her to the basement of Malfoy Manor, where she can’t disapparate?<br>
</li>
<li>Reading ahead, she is probably on a strict schedule and will vanish at a given time, short after confirmation that she is a Replacement. Will removing her from the dorm break the temporal connection or will she vanish anyway before she can be charged and killed. [Since we don&#39;t know anything about her method of time travel, I cannot think of any techno-babble that would make this sound plausible in either way. Better don’t try.]<br>
</li>
<li>And will the RA even work, when the C-CAD doesn’t? <br>
</li>
<li>Of course Agent Hieronymus remembers reports from agents who had no problems with technology at Hogwarts, but he doesn’t believe everything he read. They must have cheated in some undocumented way.<br>
</li>
<li>The SEP field? It’s a lie. How would an SEP field generator work at Hogwarts?</li>
</ul>
<br><br>(34 – 41) <br>In an awkward dialogue, Hermione makes Harry confess that she is the first person he thinks about in the morning, and the last person he thinks about in the evening, and the person whose happiness is more important than his own, and for whom he would die without hesitation. <ul>
<br><li>How often were we present when Harry woke up or went to sleep, read his thoughts and didn’t see any of these? <br>
</li>
<li>Was this meant to be romantic?<br>
</li>
<li>Agent Hieronymus has a backup plan. Find some spellotape, or Imagine (capital &quot;I&quot;) it. There is certainly some spellotape in the drawer of Dean’s bedside cabinet, left over from when he spellotaped the Westham United poster to the wall above his bed; and the bedside cabinet is at the bed-head, which is – uh – over there. [The scene should be sufficiently undefined and wobbly to make this work, and it’s certainly not a special ability; other agents have done something similar.] </li>
</ul>
<br><br>(42)<br>Actually, Harry believes that he did already show Hermione that he would die for her without any hesitation. <ul>
<br><li>Now Agent Hieronymus would like to quote Harry&#39;s thoughts from DH 34 to Harry. He didn&#39;t die solely for Hermione, and she didn&#39;t even take the first place. <br>
</li>
<li>Assassination plans may need to be shifted around for better pacing.</li>
</ul>
<br><br>(43 – 44)<br>Then Hermione and Harry begin to make out, and Rose-Sue tells them to &quot;save all the sex stuff until three months today at eight thirty in the evening please&quot;.<ul>
<br><li>So realizing your &quot;real true love&quot; doesn&#39;t require immediate sexual activity, and this is all about doing it at the right time so that the Sue will be conceived! She is clearly only there to ensure her own existence by talking Hermione and Harry into having sex at the right time.<br>
</li>
<li>Unconventional assassination method: Just neuralyze Hermione and Harry when this is over. If they don’t remember when they should do it, and that they should do it at all, Rose-Sue will never exist, thus being proactively assassinated.<br>
</li>
<li>But when do we read the charge list? And I&#39;m not sure whether the neuralyzer even works at Hogwarts. (This shouldn&#39;t be too easy.)<br>
</li>
<li>Ha! Confirmation that she is conceived three months after the Battle of Hogwarts. Since somebody conceived six years before they were born obviously cannot exit, Agent Hieronymus may be able to talk her out of existence. After all, the sharp sword of reason is his preferred weapon. She is certainly too old to be the canonical Rose Weasley!<br>
</li>
<li>Or too young. But I intended to gloss over the section that confirms the late birth date.<br>
</li>
<li>I know that we shouldn&#39;t interact with canons, but maybe Hermione and Ron can just be talked out of following the time traveller’s advice by some random people who don&#39;t mention the PPC. Is it also possible to convince them that they should never mention this encounter? At least Hermione understands how dangerous timey-wimey stuff is, and Harry will listen to her. Pretend to be Unspeakables from the DOM&#39;s time branch?<br>
</li>
<li>Confusing detail discovered at third read: Hermione had launched herself at Harry, who should still face Rose-Sue, but Rose-Sue pokes Harry, not Hermione, in the back, and then both Harry and Hermione turn to look at Rose-Sue.<br>Androia tries to open a portal below the Sue’s feet, but the RA doesn’t work.</li>
</ul> <br><br>(45 – 49)<br>Since the Weasleys and the Dursleys weren&#39;t enough, Rose-Sue now bashes Dumbledore and Snape and the names of Harry&#39;s sons. Then she realizes that she is at &quot;the turning point&quot;, implies that Hermione didn&#39;t get her parents back from Australia, and vanishes. <ul>
<br><li>Now I understand Harry and Hermione&#39;s non-reaction to Rose-Sue&#39;s story. It&#39;s the Suefluence. She is on a strict schedule and had to rush this to make all her points before her time is over and she returns to the future. <br>
</li>
<li>And again she lies about Dumbledore forcing Harry to stay with the Dursleys because of some stupid prophecy that was not true and about the way Snape got his Dark Mark. Get these on reading ahead? <br>
</li>
<li>If the agents didn&#39;t read ahead, they will be taken by surprise, and above-mentioned unconventional assassination methods may become necessary.<br>
</li>
<li>Actually, they did read ahead, but it doesn’t help.<br>
</li>
<li>Dramatic climax: In the last moment, Hieronymus throws himself at the Sue and hefts the charge list to her robe. It isn’t his fault if she doesn’t read it, right? <br>
</li>
<li>Afterthought: Make Androia heft the charge list to Rose-Sue’s robe; she is younger and more agile. Hieronymus may be forced to utter a command at last, because there is no time to explain his plan. </li>
</ul>
<br><br>(50 – 63)<br>Hermione confesses that all her answers to the questions she asked Harry would be him, Harry proposes, Hermione agrees to marry him, but insists that their children will not be named Albus or Severus. They decide to tell Ron later and go to sleep in one bed, but certainly not indulge into any sexual activities. Next morning, they break up with Ron and leave for Australia, &quot;where they would make sure Rose was concieved again.&quot; <ul>
<br><li>I don&#39;t understand why they expect to stay in Australia for at least three months, but this may be convenient.<br>
</li>
<li>I don&#39;t like to introduce semi-canonical sources, but I&#39;m sure that Harry doesn&#39;t have the time to accompany Hermione to Australia and stay there so long. There are still Death-Eaters to be rounded up, the Auror bureau needs every experienced and trustworthy fighter and Harry, Ron and Neville will certainly not shirk the duty. So this thing doesn&#39;t even need to be PPCed, because it wouldn&#39;t work anyway, and Rose-Sue will never exist. </li>
</ul>
<br><br><b>Replace (50 – 63) by proactive assassination:</b> Introducing himself as a mere patrolman whose name doesn’t matter, Agent Hieronymus explains to Mister Potter that he cannot accompany Miss Granger on her journey to Australia, because Kingsley Shacklebolt needs every possible help to round up the Death Eaters, and thus will soon demand Harry, Ron and Neville becoming Aurors. This breaks the Sue’s stable timeloop and establishes a new stable timeloop. Since Harry wouldn’t shirk the duty, he cannot be present when the Sue should be conceived in Australia, thus she will never exist, couldn’t travel back in time and has never been there. <br><br>While Harry and Hermione discuss the patrolman’s announcement, and the possibility that he might be with some future Time Police rather than the Magical Law Enforcement Patrol, and the fact that the time traveller actually never presented any evidence for her story, the Suefluence diminishes, Hermione realizes that she would have preferred Ron’s company on her voyage anyway and leaves for the Great Hall to be with the Weasleys.    <br><br>[This prospect actually frightens me. Am I able to write Harry and Hermione slowly returning to be in character? Or will they both just sound like me? (Androia sounding like me when I try to be polite and articulate is not a big problem for the present. Hieronymus created her as an idealized, younger, genderbent version of himself.) So there may be a cheating alternative: The agents leave early, not watching H and H’s dialog, but they stay in the common room while Hieronymus explains what he hopes to achieve and Androia calls him out for breaking the rules. When Hermione passes without seeing them, they are sure that canon reasserts itself.]<br><br><b>Post-mission</b><br>Nothing. This mission ends on a stealth cliffhanger when canon reasserts itself. Only when the interlude &quot;Trapped in the Wonderful World of Wizards&quot; begins will readers realize that the agents didn’t return from their first mission, and then [SPOILERS: The Explanation for C-CAD and RA malfunction goes here. Basically, PPC-Technology that is not explicitly &quot;Powered by Plotholes&quot; doesn’t work at Hogwarts, as long as Agent Hieronymus, cursed with the Power of Imagination, is present and not convinced that this piece of technology doesn’t use electricity in some way. (Unfortunately Agent Hieronymus is unaware of his superpower, which brought him into the PPC in the first place and, among other, yet undiscovered effects, causes all Universal Translators in his vicinity to leave his German expletives not translated.)  <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=268930;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">Makes-Things may have a solution.</a>]</p>

            <p>The tournament as a story kind of constructs itself, with its own characters (contestants), rising action (the start of the tournament all the way to the semi-finals) and conclusion (the championship battle). It has plenty of exciting drama all on its own. All we have to do is give it a narrative, and we could do <i>that</i> in quite a few different ways.<br><br>Here I agree with Iximaz, though. We should wait to see how the tournament proceeds before deciding how to do that and who will be writing it. Personally, though, I would like to see the participants write (short) introductions for themselves as trainers and their teams. Them being Boarders preferably, since a few of us don&#39;t have Permission.</p>

            <p>1) I think all three things have to stay the same. <br><br>2) There are no trainer items on Showdown. You assemble a team, choose their moves, EVs/IVs, Nautres, items, nicknames, and you&#39;re good to go.

The winner of the tournament will be presented with the Sunflower Cup, an intangible and totally shiny trophy.<br><br>We will be using Smogon&#39;s OU X/Y Banned list, with a few minor tweaks.

            <p>One of my play throughs, I had a legitimate team going though, but I got unlucky against one computer trainer.  Managed to wipe out my entire team except for a level 18 Magikarp.  The trainer had a team in the 28-32 range.  I figured I was done.  Somehow that Magikarp tackled its way to victory.  And even better, by the end of it, it managed to hit 20 and on to bigger and better things.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m willing to let all moves be used— yes, even the OHKO moves and bull moves like Destiny Bond/Perish Song. <br><br>My reasoning is, even if you paired an OHKO move with a targeting move (Mind Reader/Sheer Cold was mentioned earlier), you&#39;d waste a turn setting up, and a lot can happen in that one turn. Then, of course, if you <i>don&#39;t</i> use a targeting move, the OHKO moves only have a 30% chance to hit.<br><br>Destiny Bond is a lame move if you pair it with Shadow Tag or similar abilities, but I think we&#39;ve already established Shadow Tag is going to be banned. Without Shadow Tag, Destiny Bond can be gotten around fairly easily (and hey, if it succeeds, both people are down a &#39;mon anyway).<br><br>Same with Perish Song. Just switch out. Unless, you know, you don&#39;t have any Pokémon left, and in that case, hope you&#39;re fast. On second thought, maybe Perish Song should be banned.</p>

            <p>In the early game, Perish Song isn&#39;t too bad (without abilities or trapping moves to support it), but in the endgame it tips the scales <i>really</i> far in the user&#39;s favor, especially when they already have the advantage. It&#39;s allowed in the metagame, but I think for this mostly casual competition banning it makes sense.</p>

This is because we want to have everyone use the same teams all the way through, not swapping teammates in order to counter your specific opponents.

            <p>I&#39;m thinking it might be a good idea to have registration be through email or a similar, non-visible means. Seeing everyone post their teams like this... It might sway the choices of those who post after to make a different comp based on what they&#39;ve seen others will have. Not that I don&#39;t trust everyone, it&#39;s just that knowledge is power in things like this. Even the smallest advantage can make a difference.</p>

            <p>As I mentioned before, I think all legendaries should be banned from the tournament. It doesn&#39;t take skill or knowledge of the game in order to use one and they have the highest stats in the game. The tournament should be about how you play, not who can chose the best legendaries.</p>

            <p>I understand why all would be banned, but we already have bans on the most broken ones. Yes, they have the highest stats - that&#39;s the point. Everyone would get one guaranteed powerhouse regardless of their skill. Some of us don&#39;t have as much experience as others, and having a legendary would help offset that. Getting stomped without being able to fight back at all isn&#39;t fun for a newbie to this kind of thing,</p>

            <p>Some legendaries are quite easy to take down, especially the trio&#39;s, they&#39;re not too bad really. Other one&#39;s like Heatran and Celebi can easily be countered by a certain type (Ground and Bug respectively) and others (ie Mew and Jirachi) whilst having high stats total actually have average stats everywhere instead of one really good stat like most other legendaries, so they could also be allowed and they won&#39;t be too OP for the games overall. </p>

            <p>Everyone jump in with your own suggestions!<br><br>1) In order to allow as many people as possible to participate, Showdown will likely be what we&#39;ll use. <br><br>2) Legendaries. Will we/won&#39;t we? If we allow Mega Evos (see below), we could probably allow one Legendary per team (barring the ridiculous über-tier &#39;mons.<br><br>3) Mega Evolutions. Will we/won&#39;t we? This can bring a whole &#39;nother level of strategy to the tournament, but of course there are some OP megas.<br><br>4) Let&#39;s record the battles and share them!<br><br>5) Will this be doubles/singles/triple/rotation/inverse? <s>oh god please not the last one</s> I vote for singles. Very simple format, so even the less experienced people participating don&#39;t have to figure out the weird battle mechanics of the others.<br><br>6) Randomly assigned brackets? Impartial judge? Anyone?<br><br>7) If this goes well, I might just make this into an annual event because why not?</p>

            <p>In order to minimize the amount of rules we have to make, why don&#39;t we take advantage of the rules already in place. By that I mean the two tiers of Ubers and OU, maybe having a tournament in each if people want it, or if only one tournament is to be had then vote and whichever comes out on top happens. <br><br>I have one OU team ready for action and a couple more ideas floating around, so assume I&#39;m in, I could even make an Uber team if need be.</p>

            <p>I think it is fair to have a seventh one in the wings.  To make a single sub per match.  It adds a bit of uncertainty to a meta-heavy match.  I would recommend something like this.  At the start of the tournament each team enters their team in a form like this<br><br>1.  Lucky:  Lucario<br>2.  Frosty: Articuno<br>3.  I&#39;m Terrible at Nicknames:  Charizard<br>4.  Another Nickname:  Gyrados<br>5.  Axe Crazy:  Haxorus<br>6.  Luigi:  Lugia<br>-------------------<br>7.  The Sub:  Mewtwo<br><br>That way you have a team make up and know what the possible substitute is.  But it does not disclose movesets.  This allows Meta-Planning, but keeps it random at the same time.  And I think one sub is reasonable.  That also almost gives it the feel of the Anime&#39;s League Competition too.</p>

            <p>I think it would be beneficial if we held a few practice rounds prior to the tournament, just to get those who aren&#39;t as familiar with the modern mechanics up to speed. I would also suggest to these people to play a few Random OU battles on Showdown and maybe read up on Bulbapedia, that&#39;s how I learned to play semi-competitively. This way we can all be on more even ground when the tournament begins.</p>

            <p>1) Insofar as this post this has been pretty unanimous, so certainly.<br><br>2) I&#39;m all for Legendaries, but like I said earlier, Ubers and Legendary Megas can be a bit unfair.<br><br>3) Definitely for Megas, but again, I&#39;d prefer we avoid any Uber Megas like Mega Gengar or Kangaskhan.<br><br>4) Definitely record them. Maybe also share links to ongoing battles in a thread and/or on the IRC so they can be watched in real time?<br><br>5) I don&#39;t think Showdown supports rotation battles yet, I&#39;d be for Doubles or Singles, though preferably just singles this time so things don&#39;t get too complicated.<br><br>6) I&#39;d definitely like a judge if we can get one. That way we can arrange matches to the best dramatic effect. Any volunteers?<br>6b) Speaking of dramatic effect, anyone think battles should be compiled into a story, kind of like the Australian Indoors-Rules Quiddich League? We could have the winners/losers of each match write them, or even get the judge to write them all, tournament announcer-style.<br><br>7)Yes, I definitely like this idea. Maybe with a new tournament gimmick each year?<br><br>And a few questions of my own.<br><br>8) How are we going to arrange this? Considering the diverse time zones we deal with here, I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s practical to hold the entire tournament in one go. Maybe carry the whole tournament over the course of a week with a certain amount of battles taking place every day?<br><br>9) How about rules regarding movesets and Abilities? Baton Pass chains and Moody come to mind, specifically.<br><br>10) Will there be a bracket for the losers of each match so they can still participate even if they&#39;re out of the running for the Cup/Belt/Shiny Thing?<br><br>11) We need a name for the Shiny-Cup-Belt that the champion will receive.</p>

            <p>2 &amp; 3) Okay, I think everyone can agree to banning über-tier Legendaries/Megas/Mega Legendaries.<br><br>4) Most definitely!<br><br>5) Singles might end up being the standard format for everyone even in future years, so new participants can have fun, too.<br><br>6) I&#39;d love to volunteer as a judge, but I also want to participate...<br>6b) ALL OF MY YES.<br><br>7) Maybe, maybe not. I&#39;d like this to be something even casual players/ newcomers can at least enjoy.<br><br>8) Oh, definitely impossible to do this in one day. Probably hold it over the course of a week, maybe two weeks if that becomes necessary. I suppose whenever a pairing comes up in the brackets, both list off times they can participate and something can be arranged.<br><br>9) I&#39;m not too sure; I&#39;d like to see everyone else&#39;s stance on this. I personally don&#39;t have a problem with Baton Passers (hey, if you can pull it off, good for you!) but Moody could present a problem. I&#39;d be in favor of banning that and any abilities that prevent switching, such as Shadow Tag.<br><br>10) There could be, but it seems like a lot more work. Someone else can organize that. :P<br><br>11) <s>NOMINATING HUINESORON TO DRAW A LOGO</s><br>How about just PPC Annual Pokémon Tournament? Because I really want this to become a yearly thing. The winner gets the Sunflower Badge.</p>

            <p>1) Showdown is I think required.  I personally do not have anything past the first half of Gen. 5, and my network is not well suited to using the DS for online play.<br><br>2) I think 1 Legendary per team is perfectly acceptable, regardless of its overall strength, except maybe Mega Evolutions.  In G/S/C I was able to beat a level 100 Mewtwo with a non-legendary.  It was a pain in the rear, but it can be done.<br><br>3)  I would be inclined to disallow Mega Evolutions, but that is just because I have not played X/Y so I am not particularly familiar with the mechanic.<br><br>4)  Recording, makes no difference to me<br><br>5)  I would vote for Single or Double<br><br>6)  For the first time doing this, I think Random Brackets works best<br><br>7)  If it goes well, you can use the results of this initial tourney to seed the net one.</p>

            <p>Maybe as to randomized brackets do something like dice rolling depending on the numbers. <br><br><br>I will also be honest, I don&#39;t much care for Smogon.  When I was into the competitive battling, a large chunk of their movesets were either A) Almost impossible to get unless you went through extreme chain breeding or B) Straight up illegal movesets</p>

            <p>The counters are moves that don&#39;t check accuracy, like Aerial Ace and Disarming Voice; moves that lower evasion, such as Sweet Scent; moves that increase your own accuracy, like Hone Claws; moves that temporarily nullify evasion, such as Foresight and Mind Reader; and Haze, which instantly reverts all stat changes.</p>

            <p>I just like that Articuno moveset so I mention it when I can.  Evasion makes no difference to me.  I can work around it.  Many of my mons have moves like Aura Sphere (always hit unless in semi-invulnerable state)<br><br>Not to mention there are plenty of other ways around it.  That&#39;s why I love that Articuno set.

            <p>The author&#39;s almost certainly getting confused with the Blue Wizards, Morinehtar and Romestamo - though they tended to wander around Harad and Rhun, respectively, so when they found the time to get jiggy with an elf is anyone&#39;s guess. That said, in that setting? Portal-fu&#39;d be my approach. Stick her inside Earendil; being in the core of a star often offends.</p>

            <p>Are you asking how agents should be created?  Are you asking is uniqueness a problem?  Do you want to maybe run the agent by the community and get input?<br><br>I will say this, I cannot specifically say as to agents, so my advice is more about characters in general.  When I have a character I am having trouble with I take one of two approaches.  I either scrap the character and start from scratch or I keep revising.<br><br>Lets look at this character you are having trouble with.  I will use my own as an example.  Right now I am still pre-writing my future agents, deciding what I like, what I don&#39;t, etc.  One of them, Cipher-7, which I introduced in our semi-RP thread a little while ago, is pretty well set, I just need to finish out a few details with her.  The second one, which is more in line with what seems to be your problem, as of now is named The Justicar and I really have nothing else to him.  I just was not quite feeling the character, almost that the development would be artificial, unnatural.  So the way I see it, I can use that character and keep revising.  <br><br>For the Justicar, I had intended a Time Lord Agent.  Lets say, I like the idea, but my initial version did not work.  I might take his sense of fashion and background and start a new character from scratch.  Or alternatively, I am unsatisfied with the character all together and scrap him.  Start with something new.  Different.  Right now I am looking for something that is going to clash with Cipher-7.  She is basically a strict by-the-book military type.  She likes using range and strategy to take down an enemy, and is frankly a bit racist towards non-human species.  So, if I want a good foil for her, I come up with something like this.  <br><br>1)By the book:  The character does not need to be undisciplined or a loose cannon, but maybe his book of strategy looks a bit different.  Maybe his book says Attack!  Attack! Attack! and Shoot First, don&#39;t ask questions.  So there is a difference in discipline that will work well here.<br><br>2)Range and Strategy:  Well here the clash would be someone who likes to get up close and personal and acts rather than thinking<br><br>3)Dislikes non-humans:  Make the character a non-human.<br><br>Really what I am trying to say here is if you are at a lack for ideas, and you like your one future agent, then create a foil for it.  In other words Cipher-7&#39;s foil would be either a Klingon or Krogan and both are from Science Fiction universes.  And so now you already have a potential plot that the characters would drive.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Alternatively what you could do, especially considering the nature of the PPC, is consider a type of character from one of the universes.  Say you wanted a Tolkienverse Elf.  You have a large chunk of the creation done, because of the requirements, range of abilities, appearances, etc. in the Canon.  What would be done then, is build the character out from there.<br><br>---------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Additional Alternative<br><br>If you are going an original character route, then really my advice to you is start at the core.  Find something you want, be it a name, a race, an ability, talent, etc.  Use that as a kernel to build on.  Look at it this way.  I have a character, lets call it X for right now, all I know is that I want the character to be male.  So now X is a man.<br><br>You can then ask yourself some questions about that character.  Where is he from?  Does he have any family?  How old is he?  What is his favorite food?  Does he have a name?  Things like that.  <br><br>When stuck with any character you can always ask yourself questions.  Have a metaphorical discussion with the character.  <br><br>I hope that helps.<br><br></p>

            <p>She should be more careful when expresing her ideas, because most of the Imperial leadership <a href="http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Sith_%28species%29">aren&#39;t humans</a>.

            <p>She is more or less expressing the majority of what the Sith Empire is.  She fears the Sith and would not speak ill of them, but her absolute loyalty is the Empire, not the Sith.  And the two are different.  When given a choice between doing something that satisfies the whim of a Sith or something that benefits the whole of the Empire, she&#39;ll pick the Empire every time.  <br><br>The problem with a Thalmor though, is that the odds of them killing each other is quite high.  I think a Krogan fits a better foil.</p>

            <p>Or DMC for that matter. I&#39;d hate to think of the outcome of this happening in a Star Trek badfic, though! XD Seriously, though, I picked buge because it is the only Suvian color I know of with beige in it. I thought it would make a neat excessive counterpart to urple prose. I&#39;d be open to other suggestions of the sort, though.<br><br>And yeah, the biggest source of conflict in this RC is between Lapis and Cupid.

            <p>French physicist, 20th century. Proposed that all matter can behave like a wave. The object&#39;s wavelength, lambda, is calculated by <br><br>lambda = h/p<br><br>where h is Planck&#39;s constant and p is the particle&#39;s momentum (mass*velocity). Note that for very large objects (anything you can actually see) the wavelength is insignificantly small (10^(-34) metres, give or take several powers of 10) but for something as small as an electron you get something around the 10^(-12) metres range, which corresponds to the spacing between atoms. This leads to some very interesting effects such as electron diffraction, a technique commonly used to study crystal lattices.<br><br>De Broglie&#39;s hypothesis eventually became the basis of wave mechanics and an important step forward for early 20th century physics.</p>

Doctor Who is more culturally relevant, but MLP takes less time. You can watch two episodes of pony for every one episode of Who. I am a little biased towards pony, but feel free to pick either.

            <p>Season four is probably my second favorite season. (Season two being my favorite, if you must know.) It&#39;s on Netflix if you have it, or on DailyMotion if you don&#39;t. I won&#39;t link to the DailyMotion, just in case Overlord Hasbro is watching us, and will remind you that that form of internet streaming is semi-illegal. Now, go watch how you will.</p>

            <p>Should I be surprised that Daleks don’t know how life on earth works? Since when have the goblins anything to do with marriage or heritage (other than keeping family heirlooms in their vaults)?  Gringotts is a fricking bank, not the Justice of the Peace’s office!<br><br>Ahem. Although it’s wrong, I can at least understand where Weasley bashing and Dumbledore bashing comes from. But where did the Harry Stu get this?<br><br>Also, I may have found two typos:<br><br><i>The sooner we get <b>his</b> over with, the sooner I can scoot off to somewhere else.</i><br>Should be &quot;this&quot;?<br><br><i>He and his companions watched <b>at</b> the Order members barely escaped with their lives into Number 12.</i><br>Should be &quot;as&quot;?<br><br>HG</p>

            <p>The Guardsman looked up from his workbench and turned to his quarian partner, who was reclining on the RC&#39;s couch. She waved her Omni-tool at him. &quot;It&#39;s a joint DMS and Floaters mission featuring the Librarian, that new Time Lady, and their partners,&quot; said Naya. &quot;You might get a kick out of the Librarian&#39;s reactions to the &#39;fic...&quot;<br><br>The Time Lord flicked his laser screwdriver towards his partner&#39;s Omni-tool and downloaded the report from the <i>Mass Effect</i>-verse computer. He then connected a cable to a port in his screwdriver&#39;s side and plugged the other end to his desktop computer. He moved the mouse, brushing aside a collection of electrical components and a half-empty mug of cold coffee with a swipe of his arm. He accessed the laser screwdriver&#39;s memory banks and double-clicked on the report&#39;s file. The Guardsman quickly read the report, brow furrowing the more he scrolled down the page. When he reached the end of the document he swivelled in his seat to look at Naya. <br><br>&quot;He-- he <i>ran</i> from the Duty!&quot; spluttered the former soldier. &quot;They were fighting friggin&#39; Daleks. <i>Daleks</i>, Naya! This stuck-up cowardly piece of...&quot; he made choking motions in the air in front of him as the rest of the sentence ended in a growl.<br><br>&quot;Now, don&#39;t do anything stupid,&quot; said Naya from the couch. &quot;The last thing we need is you yelling at a member of the Continuity Council--&quot;<br><br>&quot;To hell with Morgan&#39;s little private club. HQ&#39;s &#39;humanized&#39; Daleks are moving again. They want to claim a part of the canon materials the Continuity Council brusquely removed from the Musée des Univers Perdus&#39; Gallifrey exhibit,&quot; muttered the Guardsman, turning back to his work. &quot;Naturally, the Council refused and so the Daleks got angry and say they wanted their &#39;heritage&#39; back, and now DIA is stuck in the middle of it. Nothing but trouble, these people. I wish the Council would just disband already.&quot;<br><br>&quot;They&#39;re doing work on behalf of your homeworld--&quot;<br><br>&quot;What work?&quot; grumbled the Guardsman, reaching for a circuit board. &quot;Provoking the Daleks isn&#39;t the will of the Homeworld. We fought the War and both our races suffered horribly. Round one was bad enough: I&#39;m certain round two will kill us all.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Point taken,&quot; said Naya, &quot;but have you actually tried speaking with any of them? Have you explained your concerns?&quot;<br><br>The Guardsman laughed. &quot;As if Morgan wants anything to do with me. She&#39;d just straight-up ignore me or accuse me of speciesism against the Daleks again.&quot;<br><br>Naya stood up, made her way over to her partner, and put a three-fingered hand on his shoulder. The Guardsman turned and looked at her glowing eyes though her visor. &quot;Go and talk to the Council,&quot; she said forcefully. &quot;You&#39;re a Time Lord. The Continuity Council <i>has</i> to listen to what you have to say: you&#39;re one of them. If you&#39;re really that worried about the Daleks being a threat, then it falls on the Tigereye Castellan to investigate the situation.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Oh, please no,&quot; said the Guardsman. &quot;Not Morgan.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yes, Morgan. Sort out your differences and make sure that the HQ Time Lord front is a <i>united</i> front. You get what I&#39;m saying?&quot;<br><br>The Guardsman rubbed his eyes. &quot;I must be out of my mind. Okay. I&#39;ll go and talk to her sometime this week. You happy?&quot;<br><br>Behind her teal-tinted visor, Naya grinned. &quot;Sounds good to me.&quot;<br><br>- - -<br><br>((I couldn&#39;t resist.))</p>

            <p>I was getting worried you had lost interest, and it would be a shame to see one of the most unique PPC stories ever written go unfinished!<br><br>Ahem.  Fanboying aside,<br><br>Interesting name-dropping of N.A.S.T.Y.  I&#39;ve thought about involving them in more recent stuff from time to time, but somehow, I didn&#39;t make the connection to the canon kidnappings in &quot;Blank Sprite&quot; and the &quot;Abduction&quot; part of their acronym.  Although, now it sounds like that might have been a red herring, but it&#39;s still an interesting idea that the PPC&#39;s antagonists might not be the typical Suvian/fanbrat numbers for once.<br><br>I liked the build-up to the reveal about Agent Sergio&#39;s past.  (Although you fooled me for a few lines; I thought it was going to turn out to be Sergio himself who owned that bullet, and that time travel was going on.)  It&#39;s a good addition to what we learned about him in past parts, and I&#39;m looking forward to hearing about his past in the next installment.<br><br><i>And now for the traditional <s>Hierony</s>doctorlit list of errors:</i><br><br>“And?” Homura asked while impatiently shifting her weight from one <b>feet</b> to the other.<br><br>The trio entered the building carefully, looking for any threat. Inside there were a couple of old tractors and <b>an harvester</b>, alongside . . .<br><br>“But <b>It</b> might be part of it. Nikki, cover the door . . .&quot;<br><br>Sakura looked down in <b>though</b> for a bit, and then nodded. “You’re right. Everything will be <b>alright</b>.”<br><br>Those were composed by the half-demolished stone tower Sergio <b>has</b> spotted from the shed, and what remained of a low stone wall.<br><br>She didn’t know what to do, and was <b>quite quite</b> surprised when she saw Sergio kneeling down and hugging Homura tight.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m catching up after a quite busy week. So, what&#39;s to say? I like Ginger and Alloy&#39;s banter. There are only two minor issues at the beginning and the end of the interlude:<br><br><i>Ginger had just finished rolling the metal club in plain brown wrapping paper when it rolled onto her fingers, and Ginger swore at it viciously.</i><br>I&#39;m not a native speaker, and I can&#39;t tell exactly what feels wrong here. It may by the repetitiveness of “rolling” and “rolled”. Maybe “Ginger had just finished wrapping the metal club in plain brown  paper when it rolled onto her fingers...” would work better.<br><br><i>&quot;Can I read my book now?&quot;</i><br>I remember that Alloy apparently intended to read <i>Guards! Guards!</i> when Ginger distracted her  with the wrapped present, but somehow Alloy asking this question now feels still wrong. The reason is probably that it doesn&#39;t fit the situation, because Alloy was the one who didn&#39;t shut up. A statement like “I will read my book now” may work better.<br><br>Speaking about something different:<br>If I didn&#39;t remember your Permission request, it would be a bit disconcerting that the first mission starts with “the newly-renamed Alloy“, and now the agents talk about the renaming, but new readers didn&#39;t see the event. It would be nice if you made your Recruiting prompt an interlude and linked it before the first mission on Alloy and Ginger&#39;s pages.<br><br>HG</p>

            <p>So, TheShyIon and I were emailing and we noticed something odd: On the Wiki page for <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Original_Series">The Original Series</a>, it mentions that the mark set by it was 26 missions. However, on the <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Turnover">Turnover</a> page, it says the mark is 20 missions. What&#39;s going on with that?<br><br>The reason this came up is because I realized I&#39;ve hit 21 missions (20 with Rina and her partners, 1 with that DBS pair.)</p>

            <p>Yes indeed, the game where the rules are made up, and the points don&#39;t matter. Yes, like the Daisy&#39;s troubles are to the Flowers, they just don&#39;t matter. I&#39;m your host, The Host! My parents had very clear dreams for me as a child. Sadly, I never had much skill at law, so I became a game show host instead.<br><br>Yes, this is the PPC Board version of <i>Whose Line?</i>, where you, yes, you, the boarders, get to have some fun with some improv and mini-roleplay. There are many games we will be playing, and the fun only stops when you want it to! Or when Iximaz posts her next five missions and pushes this post off the front page. So, roughly three days.<br><br>To start off, we will need some suggestions for our first game <i>Scenes from a Hat.</i> Here is how it will work:<br><br>The first reply to this post will be by The Hat, saying, &quot;Place Suggestions Here!&quot; You are to reply with your scenario for us to react to under the name &quot;Suggestion&quot;. Quotation marks are optional. For the title box, put &quot;Official Unofficial Suggestion&quot;. Then, to make sure nobody reads the scenario before I choose it for the game, you are to post the following, exactly, into the text box before your suggestion:<br><br>NO PEAKING! NO PEAKING! NO PEAKING! NO PEAKING! NO PEAKING! NO PEAKING! NO PEAKING! NO PEAKING! NO PEAKING! NO PEAKING! NO PEAKING! NO PEAKING! NO PEAKING! NO PEAKING! NO PEAKING! NO PEAKING! NO PEAKING! NO PEAKING! NO PEAKING! NO PEAKING! NO PEAKING! NO PEAKING! NO PEAKING! NO PEAKING! NO PEAKING! NO PEAKING! NO PEAKING! NO PEAKING! NO PEAKING! NO PEAKING! NO PEAKING! NO PEAKING! NO PEAKING! NO PEAKING! NO PEAKING!<br><br>Then, post your scenario suggestion. These can be PPC related, Real Life, fandom, whatever you want. I would highly suggest that everybody read <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/ScenesFromAHat/wiki/examples#wiki_scene_prompts">This Guide from /r/ScenesFromAHat</a> before writing your prompts.<br><br>The prompts will be picked at random by me for getting posted for you all to react to, in any way you wish. Whomever has the cleverest response will receive the points for the round. If your suggestion or quip is not selected, don&#39;t take it to heart. All it means is that I probably don&#39;t like you very much.<br><br>Right, that should be all the rules we need! I would say they will be updated as needed, but what&#39;s the fun in that? Chaos is always fun! Besides, the Board doesn&#39;t have an edit button...<br><br>Let&#39;s play!</p>

            <p>I know how fun Cards from a Hat is, and will gladly continue with the prompts until this thread is kicked off the front page. Perhaps beyond, if people are still playing. However, how do you want to handle the other games? I was planning on playing Alphabet, or If You Know What I Mean. Perhaps Hoedown or Irish Drinking Song, if I could get the game to work in text form.<br><br>My question is, do you want me to keep this thread for Cards from a Hat, and start new threads for other games later, or do you want me to keep all <i>Whose Line</i> activities in this thread? It&#39;s all up to you, I&#39;m flexible.</p>

            <p>I was involved in a small RP a small while ago that was essentially this, we were able to do Song Titles (so having a conversation made up purely out of song titles) which I&#39;m sure could be converted, and Newsflash, trying to &#39;report&#39; on Gangnam Style was &#39;fun&#39; to say the least. <br><br>Either way, I think new threads per game would probably be better else it&#39;ll die out quickly.<br><br>Storme Hawk</p>

            <p>I don&#39;t think the Flowers are particularly aware of race at all. They&#39;re not even mammals, and they seem to have genders mostly as a convenience for the agents--what would they care about different types of humans? I think they categorize humans mostly into groups like, &quot;Wielding a Weed Whacker,&quot; &quot;Yelling incoherently about asparagus,&quot; and, &quot;Likely to have a couple more good missions in them.&quot;</p>

            <p>Now I shove it into the dark corner of my past that includes my old Twitard knowledge. <br><br>Unfortunately, I still know both series very well, and it seems a shame to let that go to waste when the Plot Continuum nees me and ahaha I can&#39;t keep a straight face. Nah, this mission is going to be Zeb&#39;s territory. Rina&#39;s memories didn&#39;t all copy over properly, right? So she refamiliarized herself with the fandoms she liked... leaving Zeb their canon expert for Eragon fics. The Flowers still need to teach the guy who actually pulled the stunt a lesson, after all.</p>

            <p>I read it around the time it first came out.  I was in the appropriate demographic to really enjoy it.  I still reread them on occasion.  It isn&#39;t the greatest writing in the world, but it isn&#39;t the worst.  It is very good for the up to 16 range that might find Game of Thrones and LotR a bit heavy or a bit out of their comfort zone.<br><br>I remember way back when, I had actually started working on a fanfic for it.  I never posted it, and lost all back ups of it, but from what I remember, the OC was a very blatant Stu.  Ancient Dragon Rider who happened to be somewhere off over the sea while all important events happened.  It was going to be bad.</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve read the first couple books, too, and I didn&#39;t think they were horrible. They were mildly entertaining, making for a decent book-on-tape to listen to while I packed for moving one day (so I suppose I listened to rather than read them? Close enough.)<br><br>They read like a decent author&#39;s early work, like something you might write for a college creative writing course. They&#39;re rough around the edges--this person needed more practice before they got published. If I remember correctly, the author was unusually young to be starting his career as an author when he wrote them.<br><br>People oughtn&#39;t to get their work published just because they are good at writing for their age. These books would&#39;ve been much more at home as a serial novel in a school newspaper, and would have gotten a good reception there.</p>

            <p>He started work on it at 15 and it was definitely published before he was 20.  I do not remember the exact age he was though, somewhere between 17 and 19 I think.  But as far as reception is concerned, keep in mind they did spend it was on the best seller&#39;s list for its demographic for over 121 weeks I think.  It was well received.  Now the film on the other hand...don&#39;t get me started on that.  <br><br>But I do agree with them being kind of <i>meh</i> as you put it.  I loved them at the time, but I was reading the first two when I was 13-15 or so.  After a few more years I have come to acknowledge that as far as children&#39;s books are concerned, they are good, but that&#39;s it.  They have lost appeal to older demographics, because to me, they never really matured.  Unlike say, <i>Harry Potter</i>  which by the time <i>Deathly Hallows</i> came around, it had gotten much more mature.  And I would even say that DH was bordering the YA and Adult demographics.<br><br>Then again, by the time <i>Brisingr</i> and <i>Inheritance</i> were released, my own personal tastes took a turn for the darker, which may have contributed to my subsequent neutrality to the series.   </p>

            <p>Hi, my name is NewKryptonite. Similar to the case of many agents, I&#39;ve stumbled into the PPC rather by accident. Fanfiction has only ever been on the edge of my radar, and the idea of it usually leaves a bad taste in my mouth. <br><br> But this place...this wonderful Douglas Adams-esque world...It&#39;s my kind of weird! I&#39;ve been wandering around the wikia for a couple days now and have enjoyed myself thoroughly. <br><br> I would take a moment to praise the author who got me in. warrior_joe, I don&#39;t know if your still active, but Fritz and Silas are wonderful. (I have fixed a permanent high five to this post, and anyone who can point me to more of his stories is free to accept it) <br><br> I still lack a drive to explore the world of Fanfiction myself, but the antics of the Agents enthrall me, so I will eventually be making one to join their ranks. My sister reads FF often, so she will be finding the BadFic&#39;s and creating her own Agent to team up with mine.<br><br> Now, my introduction is certainly not the most interesting thing you&#39;ve read this week, so I would like to introduce you to an Agent that might be. I have no intention of asking for permission yet, but I&#39;ll readily ask for criticism on my character from anyone willing to give him a look-see.<br><br>Link to Docs: <br><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NOuBYLn7xC6fV2M7aAXjd5SFlduGuqgKbj3k38BJL80/edit?usp=sharing"><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NOuBYLn7xC6fV2M7aAXjd5SFlduGuqgKbj3k38BJL80/edit?usp=sharing">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NOuBYLn7xC6fV2M7aAXjd5SFlduGuqgKbj3k38BJL80/edit?usp=sharing</a></a><br><br>Thoughts? Complete overhauls? Funny situations for the character? Ideas for his HQ integration? All of these and anything else is welcome. <br><br>I look forward to having some fun and getting to know you all.</p>

            <p>... What? Why are you looking at me like that? I said it just in case.<br>Anyway, that&#39;s weird, I&#39;ve also got a huge sentient lizard kinda-planned agent. Though he looks more like a wall lizard, and he&#39;s from an original sci-fi continuum (the much-famed &quot;book I&#39;m totally planning to write, one day, maybe&quot;). Oh, by the way, here&#39;s a bottle of clear vinegar. Gift from him. Don&#39;t ask.<br>And from me, there&#39;s this jar of <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Sue_Colour_Spectrum#Glose">glose</a>-flavoured syrup. Tastes oddly good, but the Sueness combined with the sugar content might make it too sweet for some people.<br><br>Anyway, I&#39;m no expert, but I think your agent is looking pretty good! Though there&#39;s no way to really be sure about that until you really start writing about him, but take your time ^^</p>

            <p>Hi there! My brother, NewKryptonite, introduced me to your institution last week, and I must say that I&#39;m both entertained and intrigued. He knows I love Fanfiction and has asked to partner with me in joining your site. I am a she.<br><br>Now, he jokingly told me to create a comprehensive list of my fandoms. Yeah, no. That would take far too much time and you wouldn&#39;t actually want to read the whole thing. Thus, here is the short list which I regularly go back to and/or for which I often peruse ff.net.<br><br>Books:<br>Lord of the Rings/The Hobbit, Deltora, Harry Potter, The Last Apprentice, and the like.<br><br>Movies:<br>Avengers, Rise of the Guardians, How to Train Your Dragon, Big Hero 6, Sherlock Holmes, and a whole host beyond.<br><br>Anime: GetBackers, Pretear, Escaflowne, One Piece, and a plethora of others.<br><br>Manga: NG Life, Kuroko no Basuke, W Juliet, and a ridiculous amount besides.<br><br>Cartoons: Gravity Falls, Over the Garden Wall, Teen Titans, Xiaolin Showdown. That&#39;s it for these, though I do dabble in MLP thanks to my brother.<br><br>Games:<br>Final Fantasy (7, 8, 9, 10, 13), Legend of Zelda, Jak and Daxter, Kingdom Hearts, Smash Bros...No, I think that actually is it for the games.<br><br>So there you go. That&#39;s the short list. Anyway, I&#39;m off to read the required literature and to seek out those poor characters and plot lines in need of rescue. Goodness knows, so many out there need it.<br>Pleasure to meet all of you! See you around!</p>

            <p>First, how many Elder Scrolls games have you played? I am assuming only Skyrim, as you list that game as his home continuum, rather then Elder Scrolls. That is not something that needs to be fixed, necessarily, but I felt I should point it out. Then again, Za was only used as a prefix in Arena and Daggerfall, so perhaps you played more then I thought.<br><br>Where is Za’kiir from? Was he born in Elsweyr, or, well, elsewhere? If Elsweyr, which region? The vast deserts of Anequina, or the jungles of Pelletine? This is important, as it may help with personality and culture. The Khajiit from Anequina are desert nomads, fighting in tribes amongst each other. Think Arabic influences. Meanwhile, Pelletine is the center of trade, nobility (such as Khajiit have nobility, save the Mane) and production.  If from Pelletine, Za&#39;kiir may be a merchant, or a moon sugar producer (the main export of Elswyr), or a guardsman.<br><br>However, what if Za&#39;kiir hails from another land? Cyrodiil, or Morrowind, or even Skyrim? Then, ask yourself, why was he from there? Was he born in one of those provinces? Did he travel there for trade? Became a sell-sword? If from Morrowind, was he a slave who recently found freedom, due to the collapse of the Dunmer nation? Or, was he from Elswyr, and was banished to one of the other lands?<br><br>You mentioned he has a pension for hoarding shiny objects. Where did this come from? Both meta-contextually, and in-character. I have a slight suspicion this arose from the stereotype about Khajiit being a race of thieves. Don&#39;t worry, the stereotype is mostly true. However, I want to be sure you understand <i>why</i> they have this reputation. First, and foremost, is because of Khajiiti ideas of ownership. Let me paint you a short scenario.<br><br>Lets say a Khajiit man is hired at a local good store. The shop owner tells him to move some inventory upstares. The Khajiit does so, and continues doing so for a while. Eventually, he gets hungry. Upstairs, he sees a fish on a barrel. Being hungry, he takes the fish, and eats it. When the shopkeeper finds out, he fires the Khajiit and has him arrested for theft. Khajiit is confused as the guards drag him off to prison. He stole nothing! He only ate a fish!<br><br>To you and me, it is clear that the fish belonged to the shopkeeper. However, to the Khajiit, it was just a fish out in the open. Had the fish been labeled that it belonged to the shopkeeper, then the Khajiit would not have taken it. Well, at least, not without compensation. As it was, it was just a dead fish out in the open. Who owns every fish in the world? It belonged to nobody, and so now belonged to Khajiit.<br><br>However, more pertinent to you character, is the second ideal of Khajiit. That of cleverness. The cat people of Elswyr pride themselves on cleverness, and one way of showing that cleverness is to take things that belong to others. What matters to the Khajiit is intention. Did they steal it for the thrill of taking what belongs to others? For showing how light their fingers, and quick their paws? For the glory of breaking through impenetrable defenses? Then, all is forgiven, and Khajiit is praised for their cleverness. However, if it is out of selfishness, or greed, then they are among the worst of Khajiiti society. They could even be banished, should it be heinous enough.<br><br>Basically, what I need is back story. Even if we never directly see it, or have it only slightly alluded too, or even never mentioned at all, it is still a good idea to have the back story in mind. I love the Elder Scrolls seres, and would be happy to help you through the lore, if you need it. Short of that, I will need to see him in action before I can juge further. </p>

            <p>I agree with much of what was said above.  <a href="http://elderscrolls.wikia.com/wiki/Khajiit"> This </a> is a pretty good introduction to the Khajiit from a lore standpoint.  I was going to ask what exact Kajiit breed you were going to go with a Cathay-raht or Cathay will be very different from a Senche.<br><br>For naming conventions <a href="http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Khajiit_Names"> this </a> is a pretty comprehensive naming guide for Khajiit.  <br><br>Though I do not see anything too problematic, just areas to add a bit more fleshing out.  </p>

            <p>Yeah, I know the generator you&#39;re talking about. A very good one, but covers every game. Still, if it was in one game, it&#39;s canon.<br><br>Just slightly curious, why did you make a Khajiit character without playing any of the games? I am not saying you shouldn&#39;t have made one or anything, just wondering.<br><br>If you want any ideas for how to build him, I would be happy to throw some ideas around.

            <p>Skyrim was the first of the series I heard about, and therefore my favorite. The Khajiits always interested me, with their reputation and third-person speech, a distinct foreign feel. Also, I love cats in general.<br><br>And like I said, I don&#39;t have the platforms for the game or the money to get them. But the graphics in Skyrim are AMAZING, especially in the wilderness.

            <p>Skyrim is beautiful, and has a lot of great things going for it. I, myself, and partial to Oblivion, but that&#39;s because it was the first one I ever played. Morrowind is very good, but hard to get into if you are used to modern RPGs. It plays very much like a pen and paper RPG with graphics.<br><br>You have a computer, right? Steam is free, and the Elder Scrolls games are often on sale. I am sure your computer can at least handle Morrowind, which many consider the best of the games. It is not near as pretty as Skyrim, but would still give you an idea about how these games handle the lore.</p>

            <p>Her goal, above all else, was to find a way back to Elsweyr. She doesn&#39;t want to stay too long in Skyrim, only as long as needed. Thus, when she finds out she&#39;s Dragonborn, instead of telling the king, she runs away, trying to hide from it. Also because she&#39;s afraid of being recognized as a prisoner at Helgen.

            <p>...I would hold off.<br><br>The banned substances list is not meant to be an exhaustive breakdown of every nasty drug or poison. It&#39;d never end if that were the case. I would argue that the list be reserved for substances that agents could be likely to encounter during the course of a mission. That would mean substances that are either:<br>-- Canonically important or otherwise prone to showing up in a specific canon (FEV in <i>Fallout</i>, Pax in <i>Firefly</i>, or meth in <i>Breaking Bad</i>); or<br>-- Likely to be used in badfic for one reason or another.<br>Desomorphine is definitely nasty, but it also doesn&#39;t seem to be particularly common knowledge outside of specific countries. I know DemonFiren mentioned that it was part of the game <i>Space Station 13</i>, but said game does not seem to have a great deal of fanfiction associated with it that I could find (in an admittedly very quick search).<br><br>So yeah. There isn&#39;t a rule. But that doesn&#39;t necessarily mean you should add it regardless.</p>

            <p>...So I figured that perhaps it should be added. I don&#39;t know how many people here are from Russia, but it&#39;s a big place, so I thought Russian boarders might not be too rare. Krokodil is like the crystal meth of Russia, and meth is banned, but if there are too few Russians here for it to matter, then I won&#39;t bother adding it. Just figured I should mention it in case anyone else was thinking it.</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve just got a lot of really nasty knowledge (Don&#39;t ask why, I don&#39;t even know) about various horrible things. And you are right about the impurities in most cases.

            <p>Mostly because &#39;Space Station 13&#39; is spread out over quite a few different codebases with quite a few different ways of playing it.<br><br>The three biggest ones are Baystation 12 (heavy RP, brutally unforgiving medical and atmospherics system), Goonstation (no RP whatsoever, everything has the potential for being hilariously deadly and you are expected to prepare and suspect everyone) and /tg/station (middle ground, my current home.)</p>

            <p>Hi Everyone,<br><br>I&#39;ve recently landed myself a job at my local library, and I have kind of fallen into the role of custodian for fantasy, SF and assorted &quot;young adult reading&quot; section, mostly because nobody was really taking care of it. However, I realised it&#39;s been some time since I was really into reading fantasy at the volumes required to honestly recommend titles to people (although I&#39;m still more qualified than my colleagues who didn&#39;t know who Pratchett was...). Now, to put the section more into the spotlight, I&#39;ve been given room to put together a small display to showcase the variety and quality of the genre. <br>The thing is, apart from a handful of titles, I&#39;m not sure what books to put there, and that&#39;s where I need your help. I&#39;m looking for the books that you would suggest to others, the more the better!<br>...<br>(And before anyone asks, yes, I am planning on working my shift in an Orang-utan costume ;) ) </p>

            <p>They used to be pretty popular back in the day (the books I have are relics of of my mom&#39;s childhood) and are a must-read for anyone who&#39;s a fan of satire, wordplay, and puns. Especially puns. One of my favorite books in the series is called <i>Isle of View</i>. (Don&#39;t get it? Say it out loud.)</p>

            <p>I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if you haven&#39;t heard of it. But it&#39;s pretty good, a bit on the hard side of sci-fi, but it could qualify for young adult reading.</p>

            <p>George Martin&#39;s <i>Song of Fire and Ice</i>  It is a bit more mature, but it is one of the defining series for contemporary fantasy<br><br>But now a list of all possibilities<br><br>1.  Issac Asimov, <i>I, Robot</i> is probably a good place to start.  <br><br>2.  HG Wells, <i>War of the Worlds </i><br><br>3.  Bernard Cornwell, <i>The Warlord Chronicles </i>  one of the best examples of Historical Fantasy.  Also in my opinion one of the best King Arthur Stories out there<br><br>4.  Michael Crichton, <i>Jurassic Park</i><br><br>5.  Christopher Paolini, <i>Inheritance Cycle</i>  Now, hear me out on this one.  It is by no means perfect, but for a younger audience, it is a good entry point into the classical Sword and Sorcery Fantasy Novel<br><br>6.  George Orwell, <i>1984</i><br><br>7.  Haruki Murakami, <i>1Q84</i> Alternate Reality, overall entertaining read.<br><br>8.  Ray Bradbury, <i>Fahrenheit 451</i>  Distopian Future Fiction.  One of the all time classics.<br><br>9.  Frank Peretti, Ted Dekker <i>House:  The Only Way Out is In </i>  Unique fantasy horror novel.  Easy read, maybe keep a way from the kiddies.<br><br>10.  Kurt Vonnegut, <i>Slaughterhouse-Five</i><br><br>------------------------------------------------<br><br>Some others<br><br>1.  Gregory Maguire, <i>Wicked</i>, Revisionist story of the <i>Wizard of Oz</i><br><br>2.  Andrzej Sapkowski, <i>The Last Wish</i>, Adult Oriented Sword and Sorcery Fantasy novel.  The Witcher series provides the base for the game series of the same name.<br><br>3.  Timothy Zahn, <i>The Thrawn Trilogy </i>, quite possibly the best Star Wars EU material out there.  Well written, entertaining, if you like Star Wars, this series is a must.</p>

            <p>Rosemary Sutcliff, if you can find her. I don&#39;t know whether historical fiction falls under your broad &#39;fantasy&#39; remit, but I <i>do</i> know that <i>The Eagle of the Ninth</i> is classed as a YA book. I&#39;d recommend that, plus <i>Sword at Sunset</i>, a realistic Arthurian story.<br><br>Jim Butcher&#39;s <i>Dresden Files</i> series. Modern urban fantasy with a similar sense of humour to the PPC. ;)<br><br>I&#39;d also recommend anything by Ken Macleod; the best standalone is probably <i>Learning the World</i>. He writes near-future scifi with a tendency towards Scotland and socialism; <i>The Star Fraction</i> was the first one I read, and it&#39;s stuck with me ever since. In fact, if you read it, you might run across a certain little-marked denizen of HQ...<br><br>I would also heartily second... virtually all of Neshomeh&#39;s recommendations. ;) Especially Tolkien, McCaffrey, and <i>Young Wizards</i>.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>The ultimate classic sci-fi writer par excellence. I recommend <i>20000 Leagues Under the Sea</i>, <i>The Mysterious Island</i> (it is <u>critical</u> that they be read in that order), and <i>Journey to the Centre of the Earth</i>. Bonus points if you can read the original French; the translations I&#39;ve seen don&#39;t do justice to Verne&#39;s work.<br><br>Also featuring his fabulous beard and kind grandfatherly face:<br><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/archive/6/6d/20061004172921!Jules_verne.jpeg" alt="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/archive/6/6d/20061004172921!Jules_verne.jpeg"> </p>

            <p>Hello, everyone! Guess who&#39;s back. It&#39;s me! Dark Brother 16. <br><br>It has been FOREVER since I&#39;ve been on here. One thing led to another in my life, and wouldn&#39;t you know it, I&#39;m now a College freshman. <br><br>It&#39;s about a month until Summer Break, and then I should have much more time to devote to this.<br><br>To start out, I will be reevaluating the characters I wanted to use. I have had more access to many more books with the campus library, and I will probably be changing them beyond recognition, which is fine, because the ones I previously had weren&#39;t exactly approved to begin with. <br><br>That being said, I will need to go back to the wiki page and reread the submission process.<br><br>Finally, I&#39;m not sure what the process is for re-reserving stories, or if I have missed the deadline for that. If I haven&#39;t, could anyone point me in the right direction?<br><br>It&#39;s good to finally be back. Sort of. I will still be a month or so until I post anything, but I&#39;m still back!</p>

            <p>I suppose this should be my introductory speech, but I will keep it simple and short, in order to avoid potential negative points for bad grammar...<br><br>Greetings, brothers and sisters-in-arms!<br><br>You will know me as &#39;Matt Cipher&#39;, a 20-years-old bloke from Poland and a reformed Sue-thor (yes, that was a TERRIBLE period of me life). I may not be the brightest bulb, or the sharpest of nails, but there are things I&#39;m good at and which may definitely help the Organization.<br><br>My field of expertise includes mythology (Graeco-Roman, Egyptian, Slavic - you name it!), as well as the concept of magic - from &quot;Harry Potter&quot;, through &quot;Hellblazer&quot; up to &quot;The Dresden Files&quot;. I am quite confident in my knowledge from the subjects above, and my main goal will be terminating abominations from &quot;Percy Jackson&quot; universe. Some of my missions, if allowed, will be terminating badfics written in my mother tongue (with, of course, provided translation done by yours truly).<br><br>Now, I also run a small tumblr blog, where I judge Percy Jackson OCs, but that&#39;s a story for another time, since I&#39;ve done enough bragging. Here&#39;s a short list of fandoms I&#39;m part of:<br><br>Percy Jackson and the Olympians/Heroes of Olympus,<br>The Kane Chronicles<br>Harry Potter,<br>Doctor Who,<br>Lord of the Rings,<br>The Last Airbender/The Legend of Korra,<br>The Ranger&#39;s Apprentice,<br>The Dresden Files,<br>Hellblazer,<br>Sherlock Holmes,<br>Assassin&#39;s Creed,<br>One Piece,<br>Bleach,<br>Nanatsu no Taizai,<br>Pirates of the Caribbean,<br>The Secrets of Immortal Nicolas Flamel,<br>Young Samurai<br>.<br>.<br>.<br><br>Yup, the list gets longer and longer...<br><br>Anyway, I hope we can all work together in making the FanFics a better thing than just wild fantasies of tweens.<br><br>This is Matt Cipher, signing off!<br></p>

            <p>What, were you expecting a pony? No, for me, my patronus would have to be the raven. Just thinking about those birds make me smile. Have you ever seen ravens play? Ever hear them chatting to each other, calling across the trees? Have you ever heard a dog bark, yet watch the raven&#39;s mouth move instead? They are the voice actors of the animal kingdom, the birds with the silly calls and playful attitude. I have many, many happy memories connected to the raven. We&#39;re it not illegal, I would definitely keep a pet raven myself.<br><br>Oh, and as for my house? Hufflepuff. Because none of the other houses quite fit me.</p>

            <p>I have a hard time identifying ultimates like &quot;my happiest memory,&quot; so it&#39;s difficult to determine what my Patronus might be based on that.<br><br>Post-Phobos is also hard to say, because it&#39;s hard to pin down what his Patronus might be.

            <p>Much to my chagrin, it would probably be a dog.<br><br>I enjoy spending time with cats. I like dogs, but they&#39;re a bit pushy and overly friendly to me; the best sort of pet dog for me would be one that is thoughtful, quiet, intelligent, and perhaps has tendencies toward nervousness. (I&#39;m thinking collie? Some kinda Shepherd?)<br><br>But my Patronus would be nothing like that, and not very much like me in personality. It would be a large, slobbery mutt of unidentifiable breed, and it wouldn&#39;t scare a Dementor away so much as overwhelm the Dementor with its sheer enthusiasm.<br><br>This is because many of my comforting memories are of friends with personalities very much like this--people who are exhuberant and optimistic, who like me for who I am, who can be eccentric and embarrass themselves but care very little about how silly they are being. When it comes to people, my greatest fear isn&#39;t that I will embarrass myself; instead I fear that I&#39;ll hurt someone else by mistake. In the presence of these people, I can forget my worries and not be afraid that I will insult or bother them, because they are extremely hard to annoy or insult.<br><br>So my Patronus would be a dog, of the sort that is likely to wash your face with its tongue, plant its paws on your chest, and wag its tail so wildly as to take its whole hind end along for the ride.<br><br>D&#39;you see why I&#39;m a perfect Hufflepuff? :)</p>

            <p>That has to be one of my all-time favorite series, honestly. I just read Clariel recently and it completely re-sparked my love for the whole canon. Also there&#39;s a sequel to the main three books coming out soonish, from what I hear, and I&#39;m SUPER pumped.</p>

            <p>Yeah, it would be very much like the Disreputable Dog. :) Only, you know, the &quot;magical construct&quot; part would just be the fact that it&#39;s a Patronus.

            <p>then my Patronus is probably a mouse, or a rat. My younger sister is the person I love the most - she has a very advanced form of Asperger&#39;s Syndrom, therefore always needs someone to watch over her. She&#39;ll never attend school, or have a job, she can&#39;t even speak properly. We call her &#39;mousie&#39; sometimes, therefore I think that what my Patronus would be :)</p>

            <p>She will be 19 this June, but she was diagnosed with Asperger&#39;s way too late, therefore her development is very, very delayed - right now, she can take care of some fundamental needs (go to the toilet, brush teeth, etc.) - she can&#39;t even take a shower by herself. She cannot be left on her own in the house, and always needs someone - maybe not to watch her every step, but to monitor if she&#39;s not doing anything that may harm her.<br><br>She is going to school, sure, we&#39;ve been going with her to various schools, institutes and such, since she was 6. Right now, she cannot write, she barely know how to read, but the biggest problem is her expressing her needs and feelings. She doesn&#39;t even talk properly, just with some basic sentences and utterances, but mostly through noises and gibberish. When something is not as it should be (i.e. the power is out), she freaks out, screams and is scared.</p>

            <p>Best thing to do with meltdowns/shutdowns/rage-attacks/whatever, is not fear them. They happen, it sucks, it probably ruins her day, but that&#39;s life. It&#39;s kind of like dealing with seizures--you just give her space, make sure no one&#39;s hurt, and afterward let her recover and get some rest.<br><br>Personally, I get shutdown type things more often. When I was younger it used to be worse, but nowadays, I just kind of lose it, freeze, can&#39;t think or talk or do much of anything, and may or may not be crying uncontrollably, but at least I&#39;m not banging my head on things or hitting anything that gets near me. It still sucks, but at least I don&#39;t have to count bruises after I get hold of myself.<br><br>Lately I&#39;ve been realizing that sometimes I don&#39;t leave the apartment to do things I need to do because I&#39;m afraid I&#39;ll get overstimulated and have a shutdown in public. I have to fight that, because otherwise the fear of having them will stop me from doing things I&#39;m perfectly capable of doing. It&#39;s much better to plan for the possibility, reduce the chances they&#39;ll happen, go out with as much energy and focus as possible, and take your chances. Otherwise you risk being stuck at home when 95% of the time things would go just fine if you went out.</p>

            <p>See, the thing with Aspergers is that we see everything in black-and-white when it comes to daily life. It&#39;s either this way or that way, no in-between. We really do want to express our feelings and make friends, we just don&#39;t know how. We live by a schedule which must be concrete, and if it&#39;s messed up the whole world falls down. When we believe something, it will be absolute unless something comes to change it, which we don&#39;t accept very well. Change is forbidden to our minds. When we don&#39;t understand, we flee the problem, not wanting to deal with the gray area. We deny constantly what the world presents, and we fight, thinking we are winning only to lose again, and weep over how confusing everything is.<br><br>That&#39;s a summary of how Aspergers people deal with some of the world. A very general summary, but it rings true for most people with this case. I thought you&#39;d like to know.</p>

            <p>I could theoretically do well in Gryffindor or Hufflepuff, though. I wish I were a braver person, and being in Gryffindor would certainly challenge me in that direction. I also have strong values of treating other people with dignity, finishing what I start (I don&#39;t always live up to this one), and basically not being a jerk, so I could see myself as the Hermione of Hufflepuff.<br><br>As for Slytherin, I lack the ambition. Like, seriously. It&#39;s not even a question of laziness; I quite simply do not want things that make people ambitious. Social status? No thanks, I&#39;m an introvert. Power? I&#39;m very bad at power. I can do authority, but only as long as someone else is holding the actual reins. (For the PPC, that&#39;s you, the community.) Wealth? My life goals involve earning just enough to live comfortably, preferably somewhere within easy walking distance of nature, and sometimes travel to fun new places. Who needs a mansion when I&#39;m going to spend most of my time in like two rooms? Plus, all the cleaning and maintenance, yeesh. And there are so many ethical issues with hiring staff to do that stuff.<br><br>So, yeah.<br><br>Where&#39;s the Pottermore-based quiz, though? I&#39;d be interested to see what it actually says.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I suspect I would probably be a hat stall.  I always kind of thought myself as a Ravenclaw.  I always like to learn new things.  Often times difficult things, but at the same time I have some fairly high aspirations, but I am also likely to be the one sticking up for the little guy and stepping up to defend the ones I care about.  But this particular test has me at:<br><br>Ravenclaw 16<br>Hufflepuff 7<br>Slytherin 8<br>Gryffindor 9<br><br>So under that test, not as much of a hat stall.  Then again, when I did the Pottermore test I got Slytherin</p>

            <p>I somehow managed to score lowest in Ravenclaw in that one, and the rest are tied. It says 8 Ravenclaw, 10 Hufflepuff, 10 Slytherin, and 10 Gryffindor, and assigns me to Hufflepuff. Not quite sure how that works. O.o<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>On Pottermore, it always comes down to either Ravenclaw or Slytherin for me, with the last question being pretty obvious as to which answer is which House.  The first time, I went with Slytherin; then, I ended up restarting my account and picked Ravenclaw the second time around.  Overall, I think it&#39;s the better of the two for me; I&#39;m too lazy to really be considered ambitious.</p>

            <p><br>Pottermore put me into Slytherin when it was still only open for beta testers. But I don’t understand how the Sorting Hat could decide this based on the few questions it asked; it may just have been a random choice. Well, there was one question where the answers appeared to fit the house traits, and I tried to cheat myself into Hufflepuff (because I wanted to see the common room that had never been described), so the Sorting Hat nay have believed that this was typical Slytherin behavior.<br><br>Even longer ago, I took the personalitylab test, where I had to answer one hundred questions, and it said that I fit best into Gryffindor (68) with Ravenclaw as a close second choice (64), Hufflepuff (56) got third place and Slytherin (52) was the least fitting house. I don’t trust this Sorting Hat either; I’m certainly not brave enough for Gryffindor.<br><br>As for myself, I believe that I’m a Ravenpuff or Huffleclaw. <br><br>Thinking about it, I may have a good chance to become the new Headmaster and unite the Houses :-)<br><br>HG </p>

            <p>Persistent, resilient, behind-the-scenes; friendly, kind... I like Hufflepuff just fine.

            <p>I&#39;d agree with Hieronymus Graubart; it really depends on what you&#39;re looking to get out of it.  I love the background information on all the characters and the personality quiz type stuff (they have a wand one as well).  On the other hand, I&#39;m not interested in the various mini-games or social aspects.  Plus, my laptop can&#39;t really handle the graphics.  It&#39;s something I check every few months or so when I&#39;ve got a lot of spare time.<br><br>If you&#39;re just interested in the background/meta stuff you might be able to find the information elsewhere online; I know I got the wand information off Tumblr before I actually made a Pottermore account, and a lot of it&#39;s on the HP wiki.  Of course, it&#39;s also theoretically possible to go around and read the chapters with new information, but I have a bad case of 100% Completion Syndrome that makes it hard to leave the rest of them unchecked.</p>

            <p>I remember reading somewhere that because your Patronus is the personification of your hope and happiness, basically, it comes from your own mind. It&#39;s usually an animal, but it doesn&#39;t have to be an ordinary animal--Dumbledore&#39;s phoenix proves that; Fawkes is quite obviously at human-level intelligence, so we know the Patronus charm can produce magical beasts who qualify as people in their own right.<br><br>There&#39;s been speculation about having a Patronus that&#39;s not the typical animal variety, especially those produced by Muggle-borns who don&#39;t necessarily have a preconceived idea that your Patronus has to take a certain shape. It would be something autonomous and probably a creature of some kind, but it could be quite unusual. The example I read was a Muggle-born Pokemon fan producing a Patronus that&#39;s a species of Pokemon. And why not? A Muggle-born kid who loves Pokemon, thinking about good memories, desiring to produce a Patronus... why not?<br><br>We could happily speculate about the many varieties of animal and animal-like things that could serve as various PPC agents&#39; Patronus forms. I&#39;m not sure a Muggle-Use wand is good enough to produce a corporeal Patronus, though; it&#39;s a tricky enough charm that Harry&#39;s mastering it is pointed out as exceptional.</p>

            <p>It&#39;s not that it requires raw power, it&#39;s that it needs a very specific mental state to get it to work properly. So it appeared to me, at least. Besides, I&#39;d always assumed that it was more that Harry was thirteen when he got the hang of it that was exceptional, rather than the inherent difficulties of the spell itself - you&#39;ll recall him teaching it to the DA during fifth year, and Luna&#39;s in the year below him.

            <p>Practically every competent adult in the HP verse can produce a Patronus, so I don&#39;t think it&#39;s tricky for *anybody*, just tricky for a kid still in school and nowhere near graduating. Maybe it&#39;s the magical equivalent of a thirteen-year-old doing trigonometry.<br><br>As for the Notary--how about a spider? It&#39;s not so odd when you think about how intricate their web designs are. Or perhaps a bee or a termite, both of which build very highly organized hives/nests. They would be particularly amusing if the corporeal Patronus is as small as an actual bee, spider, or ant--but works just as well as any other Patronus--and the Notary got a bit pissy and had to point out that a small size for these creatures is *accurate*.</p>

            <p>that Muggle-use wands would actually make casting a Patronus a bit easier since dementors have a nasty tendency to turn up in fanfics.

            <p>I think a lazy person could get into Hufflepuff easily, depending on what they valued. Think of a friendly, warm, caring individual who didn&#39;t really want to be in the spotlight, who wanted to be a healer or a teacher, who was resilient and generally even-tempered. This person could be quite lazy, but would still fit into Hufflepuff very well.</p>

            <p>But I think that&#39;s because I just like to read and write <s>like a nerd</s>. I&#39;m fairly certain that, were I to be Sorted by the real Hat, I&#39;d be a Gryffindor.

            <p>Then again, has anyone noticed how all the Houses seem to have equal amounts of members on Pottermore?<br><br>My Hatstall came from the fact that I was sure for a long time I would be in Ravenclaw. People call me the bookworm, and I&#39;m always spouting facts. Before I joined Pottermore, I took many other quizzes, and got Ravenclaw, but slowly Hufflepuff became more frequent, with the occasional Gryffindor. I fought against this for a while. Not because I didn&#39;t like Hufflepuff, I did. But because Ravenclaws are, well, known not only for their smarts, but for imagination and creativity, things I love and have. And I thought that if I became a Puff, then I wouldn&#39;t be known for that side of me.<br><br>Next post continues this...</p>

            <p>Then I started thinking about it, and about Cedric Diggory, one of my favorite characters because of his fairness and sacrifice. Even when he and Harry were standing before the prize Cup for the Tournament, he wanted Harry to take it.<br><br>And I asked myself: Do I want to be known purely for my knowledge? And I concluded that no, I don&#39;t. The other thing that made me nervous about Hufflepuff was when the Hat said they&#39;re &quot;unafraid of toil,&quot; my younger self thought this meant physical labour, which I&#39;m not always that eager about. Then I realized that that trait could most likely mean perseverance, hard work, determination. And the pure friendliness and fairness and equality that Hufflepuff cherishes convinced me that I might be fine with either answer.<br><br>So even though I&#39;m a Puff, I still imagine I could be in Ravenclaw. Ravenclaw always got a close second on quizzes that said I was a Hufflepuff, and vice-versa.</p>

            <p>The problem isn&#39;t that my team&#39;s imbalanced, it&#39;s just that in OU, everyone on it has a counterpart further up the food chain that does what they do a bajillion times better. Oh well. My trope is Weak But Skilled and I must revel in it. =]</p>

            <p>as far as I can see, there are only two real OU teams in this tournament, granted you&#39;re up against one, and I&#39;m the second. But not many people in OU know how to counter pokemon in UU or RU without having played those tiers, that&#39;s your advantage.<br> I&#39;m currently on showdown at the moment and my team just got beaten by a team with half of its mons from RU because I severely underestimated Hawlucha and let it sweep half my team. So go out there and do it, you can you know just believe.</p>
