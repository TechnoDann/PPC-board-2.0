            <p>So, my next mission takes place in <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>, and while I&#39;m pretty comfortable with the &#39;verse, I don&#39;t feel like I know it as well as I could. Would anyone be interested in lending an agent or two to help Chris and Ami? I need someone who can help me determine how far Legolas goes OOC and whether the fact that the Sue neither hogs the spotlight nor completely derails the story means I should be merciful. If you&#39;re interested, reply with your email and I&#39;ll share the Google Doc with you. :)</p>

            <p>Guys, I have never been so proud in my entire twenty-one-year-long life. <br><br>Some of you may remember, during a thread about Asperger&#39;s, me mentioning my little sister diagnosed with a really severe case of said syndrome. Long story short, she can&#39;t be left unattended and never will be able to function without someone watching over her.<br><br>Well, today she had her Confirmation ceremony. It may seem ironic that someone like me, a Catholic just in name, to whom religion is something personal and not ceremonial and public (I also don&#39;t have one set name for the Higher Power I believe in; call it God the Father, Allah, Mother Nature - it doesn&#39;t matter to me, as long as it&#39;s a non-violent faith) but I was really glad to see her be so calm, more than she&#39;s ever been, especially with such a large crowd present. <br><br>She generally is very distant towards others, sometimes even to us, and used to have outbreaks of panic and fear when going outdoors. But seeing her there made me so happy, my heart literally turned to melted wax. The funniest thing was when everyone was praying and she was the only one to repeat everything the bishop was saying - we&#39;d later joke that she was his prompter ;D... but today I finally was able to see the progress she&#39;s made, from a complete mute who couldn&#39;t understand the world around her, to a girl able to somehow express her needs and feelings. It was simply beautiful<br><br>I&#39;m sorry if this seems like something boring to you guys. I just felt like sharing a very happy moment with the community who did so much to me these past months. You guys are the best things that ever happened to me...<br><br>Okay, I&#39;m getting too emotional. I&#39;ll stop now.<br><br><img src="http://media.giphy.com/media/ToMjGpkiNCxOKUcMBji/giphy.gif"></p>

            <p>Cause, well, it sounds like she&#39;s not on the net for me to congratulate her myself. But for what it&#39;s worth, a random fellow autistic (me, in case my phrasing was bad) on the internet wrote this for her.<br><br>&quot;You don&#39;t know me, and you probably never will. And I haven&#39;t been there, quite, but I&#39;ve been there more than a neurotypical. And if no one has ever explained or even said that word to you (and they probably haven&#39;t), it&#39;s people who aren&#39;t autistic, or mentally ill, or anything like that. <br><br>Anyway, you sound like a cool person from what your brother says about you. Good on you for finding a way to communicate, even if it&#39;s not the one your neurotypicals are looking for. Making them understand is hard, and a lot of them only want you to use their kind of communication. And if we ever met, I might not understand you either -- because we get socialized like neurotypicals. I wonder what a society of people like us would be like.<br><br>A lot quieter, I&#39;d think. <br><br>But we&#39;re out there. If you get on the net, you can probably find us. People will tell you that mouth noises you put together yourself is the only valid kind of voice, but that&#39;s not true at all. I can use it, if I&#39;m not too stressed or upset, but I sound much better in writing. And I&#39;m going off topic. Right. Anyways, we&#39;ll be here for you if typing works. And even if it doesn&#39;t, we&#39;re still out there. <br><br>I know you&#39;ve got a voice, and I don&#39;t mean that in the way where people are trying to make you make mouth noises. You have a voice just by living, no matter how much people try to take it away from you. From all of us. But we&#39;re making progress. And people are better understanding that we&#39;re not broken neurotypicals.<br><br>And if you feel horribly stressed after this, that&#39;s okay to feel. And it&#39;s okay to feel like it&#39;s a great victory. Or just a thing you did. We change like anybody else, and... I just want to let you know, because nobody knew to let me know, when I most needed it, that however you feel is valid. Your communication is valid. <br><br>My name is Io. (Pronounced E-oh.) I dunno what yours is. I hope things go well. I hope people don&#39;t try to hurt you, even though some probably will. I hope I can meet you someday, because I feel like, in a world like this, there&#39;s safety in numbers. But things are getting better. I&#39;m trying to do what I can to help make them better for future generations of us, even though I&#39;m nearly a future generation myself, and... <br><br>Well, in a world full of people I had to work so very hard to understand, I guess I&#39;m trying to make and be a connection to someone else who understands how the world is for us. And it&#39;s okay to cry, or get angry, or hum and flap your hands and pace in circles. People try to break us from our emotions, but we&#39;re still people. And people can&#39;t be made not-people just by society saying so.<br><br>And we have our own society, just a little bit, and I hope you can come experience it someday. It was far too many years before I even knew there was one. I hope things go well. I hope that the outside stays less horrible. I hope that the people around you will respect you. Respect is hard to get, but some of us manage. A lot more of us manage than society thinks.<br><br>We do grow up, after all, and find out ways to make everyone see what we actually are. And that&#39;s people.&quot;<br><br>Somehow... somehow that turned into a speech. I&#39;m sorry if this is a bad response. <br><br>...I do hope you give it to her, though, because I remember what it was like to find out that there were other people like me, who I understood without complex analysis. And I want as many of us as possible to get to feel that.</p>

            <p>This revenge fic used <i>her mother</i> to do the kill?! I vannot belive I&#39;ll say this, but couldn&#39;t the Suethor at least used a random monster for this. Killing a child in such an atrocious way is already horrid enough like this from her part, but using her mother for this...<br><br>Congratulations for this first mission, James.

            <p>I am obviously still absolutely baffled and horrified by her of use of Serena to carry out this monstrous plot. She is a loving mother and a happy-go-lucky person, the one who, as I had Aiko notice, is called the Messiah of Purity. She&#39;s the one who eventually became Neo-Queen Serinity, the founder of the Silver Millenium, an era of absolute peace and prosperity. We are taking about the person who refused to even FIGHT two of her greatest enemies and instead managed to used the Power of Love to redeem them. <br><br>And poor Rini... I won&#39;t deny that she can be a brat sometimes, but people like this Suethor ignore the reasons why she can be that way. Shewas forced to watch her family and friends be attacked and practically killed. She was manipulated and corrupted by a villian to believe that no one loved her and that even her parents hated her, to the point that for  a time she became a <a href="http://sailormoon.wikia.com/wiki/Black_Lady_(anime)">villian herself </a>. <br><br>Anyway, thank you for your comment! I am really glad that you liked my agents. :D</p>

            <p>I think it is pretty much a given that at least half the reason of why I did this because I&#39;m insane. I have wanted to do something about this atrocity ever since I heard the Fanfic Critic read, so finally getting the chance to do it may have overridden my common sense. <br><br>But as horrifying as this was, unfortunately the suffering is not over yer neither for me nor for poor Rini. I maybe a little insane, but I&#39;m not a (total) masochist, so I obviously won&#39;t do it right after this, but there&#39;s one SM Bleepfic that&#39;s arguably <i>worse</i> than even this one that also involves unspeakable acts being commited against Rini. I won&#39;t dare to link to the thing because it&#39;s just really vile, but it&#39;s called Chibiusa&#39;s Seventh Birthday and despite that innocent sounding title, it involves the poor little girl getting gang raped by all of the other senshi, including Usagi and Mamoru. <br><br>But as I said, that&#39;s not my immediate next target.  My actual next target is probably going to be the HP badfic I discussed in <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?id=199610;article=286269;search_term=his+little+girl%20">this post.</a> Dealing with canon and logic breaking potions and poorly executed fourth-wall breaking will be comparatively like a balm for  my mind after this mess</p>

            <p>So since my first thread asking about what is the weirdest changes to a canon character you&#39;ve seen was a success and off the first page I figured I&#39;d ask you guys something else.<br><br>This is based off the ending to the badfic <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10995067/16/Wipovsky-School-For-The-Twins"> Wipovsky School for Twins</a> which is a Layton Brothers Mystery Room Au where everyone for some reason has a good twin and evil twin. (Warnings for murder,puns,written out accents,and very ooc characters) If you don&#39;t know what Layton Brothers Mystery Room is it&#39;s an IOS game where you play as Lucy Baker solving murder mysteries with the canon son of Professor Layton. <br><br>It makes sense there would be a murder mystery in the fanfic no? <br>However the way the murderer gives up in this fanfic is because a very ooc(actually way too ooc to be him) Alfendi points out he had a blindfold on therefore he couldn&#39;t shot the gun. Ignoring the fact people with blindfolds can still shoot guns. <br><br>So I wonder,what is some of the worst crime solving you&#39;ve seen in fanfics? Or even in canons. <br><br> <br></p>

            <p>then I absolutely gotta go with Encyclopedia Brown.

            <p>It was less that I took it personally, than it was that I was just so bored reading it that it actually made me mad. I don&#39;t even remember what fic it was. That is just how boring it was. I remember the experience like it was yesterday, but I remember absolutely nothing about the fic itself, other than that it shipped Iji and Master Chief, along with Wrex.

            <p>Yes, I&#39;m going to try and put something out every Wednesday.

            <p>I like how the organisation felt both similar to, and different from, the normal PPC. I especially liked how the ship names were taken from standard PPC characters. <br><br>There was one word choice which seemed a little odd to me, &#39;The <i>Lambda</i>-class shuttle <i>Constance</i> <u>span through the void&#39;. I&#39;d tend to use &#39;spun&#39; as the past tense of spin myself, although that might just be because span has a different meaning in engineering terms (the distance between two supports of a beam, or the unsupported length of a cantilever beam). <br><br>Arikae&#39;s tactic at the end was an interesting one to think about. It&#39;s funny, all of the holograms we see in the films are semi-transparent, and usually blue-shifted. Not the sort of thing that you&#39;d ever be able to mistake for the real thing. Yet I&#39;m sure I&#39;ve seen several similar tactics used in the EU, including at least on example where a decoy fleet of holographic ships distracted an Imperial fleet. Which, if I&#39;m remembering it rightly, kind of implies that even the capital ships in <i>Star Wars</i> rely purely on visual targeting. <br><br>But yeah, it was good quick thinking on her part to come up with a distraction like that. <br><br>You&#39;ve got some very nice lines, my favourite here was &#39;Arikae&#39;s eyes flickered open. &quot;My everything hurts,&quot; she protested. &quot;That&#39;s just not fair.&quot;&#39;.<br><br>One other little thing that I&#39;ve just noticed is that it started off with curly quotes, but switched to straight quotes in the early part of the third section (the one that starts with &#39;There is no passion; there is serenity.&#39;.<br><br>- Irish </u></p>

            <p>Span, spun... I don&#39;t know, actually. [Checks] Well, Wiktionary says &#39;span&#39; is archaic and non-standard, then links to Reuters saying a truck span out of control.

            <p>I’m not a big fan of <i>Star Wars</i>, so holding my attention until the end is already an achievement (and it didn’t feel like I only read on because the task was not finished yet).<br><br>I may have realized something: The Tor-Kannen Crystal is another manifestation of the Kernel of the Multiverse, like the Key to Canon, and Dafid should really have taken Nita’s advice. (So I reread &quot;Fallen Feathers&quot;, and I realized that there’s a word missing in <i> She found herself the Rue Jay Thorntree ...</i>, I just can’t avoid doing this.)<br><br>I’m not quite sure whether I understand the end. After rereading the last chapter: Where you going for &quot;Technically Dafid could have destroyed Mari-Suu, the Tor-Kannen Crystal and himself at any time, but emotionally he couldn’t do it until he had said farewell to Arikae&quot;? <br><br>He, you made me reread stories while I’m catching up with the inacceptable speed of less than one day per day. Now that’s an achievement.<br><br>HG</p>

            <p>Yeah, Dafid would&#39;ve been far better off if he&#39;d just left the thing in pieces - but that was never something a mirror of Dafydd Illian would be capable of doing. ;) (Fixing the missing word now - and don&#39;t <i>try</i> to avoid doing it! We&#39;d all rather have our typos spotted, believe me!)<br><br>As for the ending - heh, now <i>you&#39;re</i> making <i>me</i> reread it! Right, what I was going for is that Dafid is capable of destroying the Tor-Kannen Crystal - possibly because he was the one who put it together, or possibly as an innate property of the crystal - ... but only when Mari-Suu isn&#39;t occupying it. That means she has to be in his head - and <i>that</i> means he has to destroy the crystal in the split second between touching it and Mari-Suu claiming full control. He could only have done it earlier if she had given him full freedom of action at any point - which she didn&#39;t.<br><br>Also, given who he is... yeah, he probably wouldn&#39;t have managed until he&#39;d said goodbye.<br><br>Thank you very, very much for the comments. It&#39;s always nice to see what people actually think!<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>That&#39;s a great idea for an AU, although I couldn&#39;t probably be part of it; I get carried away pretty easely by my emotions, so I wouldn&#39;t make for a good Jedi (Although I think that the &#39;living droid&#39; approach about them from the Order post-Ruusan was bound to cause disaster, but that&#39;s only personal opinion).<br><br>Let&#39;s hope that Episode VII will live up to the best parts of the Legends continuum.<br><br>(P.S.: How do you put italics here?).</p>

            <p>As for Dafid, even if he was not Feanorian to the basis, no Jedi could endure the Sues. must admit I findLegends-verse Jedi more realistic though, supressing any emotions like the Old Republic movieverse Jedi do is impossible, and really destructive too (That said Kotor Jedis...)<br><br>Think positive for Episode VII.

            <p>On the plus side, I&#39;m really happy to see this scene, although I must admit that now I&#39;m also thinking about the Aviator&#39;s reaction at the very moment where she learnt about Zeb, but Dawn&#39;s reaction... Was Rina really that much of a bitch back then. I mean, she was going slowly crazy, had a truckload of issues, the missions she get after regenerating were torture in all but name, but I didn&#39;t really think she was that much mean to Zeb before the killing which prompted LMM.

            <p>From &quot;Glitter Levels Spiking&quot;:<br><br><i>Zeb looked over at his partner, who was dressed in her shabby aviator’s jacket, her face thoroughly un-made up, and her nails unpolished and bitten to stubs. “Either you aren’t a very good example of the ‘element’ or this is just the Sue talking again.”<br><br>“Shut up,” Rina snarled.<br><br>Zeb backed off slightly, holding his hands up in hurt surrender. “I was just making a joke,” he muttered.</i><br><br>Later:<br><br><i>Rina just groaned and rubbed at her eyes. “I think my brain’s melting out of my ears.”<br><br>“You sure those aren’t just growing pains?” Zeb grinned.<br><br>“Zeb, you are really just asking me to whack you.”<br><br>Zeb gave his partner a hurt look. When she didn’t apologize, he sighed and opened a portal to the next chapter.</i><br><br>Later later:<br><br><i>Zeb patted her gently on the back. “We can also charge for in-fic inconsistency, too,” he said in an attempt to make her feel better. “She claimed toddlerhood lasted until thirty, not that it began at thirty.”<br><br>“Oh, sure, because that’s something to be happy about!” </i><br><br>From &quot;Wisdom Like Silence&quot;:<br><br><i>Zeb tilted his head curiously. “What, you don’t want to see your boyf—”<br><br>“Shut up, Zeb!” she snapped. “He is not my boyfriend, he’s a p***k! And I am not putting up with his jack***ery just because Des asked!”<br><br>“But, um, Rina, the Librarian isn’t—”<br><br>Rina put her head against her knees, holding her ears harder. “If you want to go, fine, but I’m staying here!”   <br><br>“Rina, if you would just listen to me—”<br><br>“GET. OUT.”<br><br>Zeb flinched, ears flattening against his skull. “I’m going, I’m going!” he cried, racing out the door. Once in the hallway, his tail drooped, and he sighed.</i><br><br>From &quot;An Overabundance of Snrf&quot;:<br><br><i>“Reyna’s dead?” Rina snarled. “Okay, that is it, I am fed up with this fic!” She drew her bow and reached for her quiver, glaring at the OC.<br><br>Zeb grabbed her arm. “Not yet,” he said. “We have to wait. We’ll kill her later.”<br><br>Rina swung around to look at him. Zeb braced himself, ready to duck if she swung at him. It was a long moment before she relaxed. “Fine,” she snapped, slinging her bow back over her shoulder.</i><br><br>And this is just from skimming. I think the fact that Zeb expected to be hit is a little telling on its own.<br><br>As for your question, I&#39;m not quite sure what you mean.

            <p>A Word World is a world created by somebody who told a story; at least that&#39;s how I see it. It doesn&#39;t matter whether the creator told the story verbatim to an audience, wrote it down, or used visual media to tell the story in (moving) images. So, yes, comics and movies are Word Worlds, even if they don&#39;t have a single word of dialogue in them.<br><br>HG</p>

            <p>...it&#39;s badly written as well as badly drawn, so it&#39;s probably at least partially a Word World in literal definition of the term. Beyond that: I think the bad drawing could either be taken as description or as part of the Word World--and in the second case, could potentially be cause for a new term--&#39;Comic World&#39;, maybe, though that could get confusing if the canon is also a comic. Maybe &#39;Art World&#39;? &#39;Art+Word World&#39;?<br><br>...it may be simpler to either count it as a sort of visual description--which feels slightly inaccurate to me--or to <s>say nobody&#39;s ever bothered giving it a special name, or</s> take &#39;Word World&#39; as an umbrella term with the intention of clarity and simplicity. Word World has been around long enough that it means something beyond its literal meaning, in my opinion; I think of it more as a term than a description, and I seriously expect my agents would as well. The literal meaning is there, but it&#39;s not the first thing I see--I see &#39;the words that form the story which have influence over the agents and characters and sometimes manifest really strangely&#39;, not &#39;world [made of] words&#39;.<br><br>That&#39;s my take on it, anyway, which was fun to think about :) Now, back to essay-writing...<br><br>~DF</p>

            <p>I just really gotta wonder what would happened in the Word World when something like this came up: <br> <br>&quot;Up to now, this narrative has dwealt on Hermione&#39;s plight. The effects of the potion on her. Now, let&#39;s switch to Ron&#39;s. You may remember, and hopefully you do, or you&#39;ve got short term memory loss issues, that the potion was meant to give Ron all the intelligence that Hermione lost. You might have assumed, since Ron&#39;s name was mentioned, literally, only ten times in the last chapter, compared to Hermione&#39;s twenty-four, that maybe since the potion was made so badly, Ron had escaped all its effects. &quot; </p>

            <p>I have just seen the wiki page of the Universal Translator, and I am not sure about how it works.<br><br>Is it something that can be installed into a RC and automatically translate everything said by agents into their mother tongue?<br><br>or is it something like a microphone which when the agents hold it and speak, the languages they are saying will be translated to another language?<br><br>and how to use it on canon characters during missions? Do agents just point the Universal Translator at them and whatever they are saying will be translated to a language that the agents can understand?</p>

            <p>I mean, HQ&#39;s &quot;official&quot; language seems to be English, and so far the Words have always been in either English or a language at least one of Agents involved understood (I did spork one in Italian, but both my Agents knew the language so it worked like a normal mission).<br><br>Universal Translators are needed more in cases the Agent himself doesn&#39;t speak English.</p>

            <p>... I don&#39;t fully agree with. I admit I had forgotten about that part of TOS, but even after having refreshed my memory there&#39;s still something I&#39;m trying to wrap my head around as it feels wrong.<br><br>I&#39;ll try to explain my point of view here: what makes things happen are the Words (aka the fanfiction text itself), right?<br><br>In the Words most dialogue is in the same language as the rest of the text, which is fully acceptable because the reader needs to be able to understand what the characters are saying. In-universe, they speak whatever they are speaking.<br><br>Now, if the language conventions apply to Agents it&#39;s all fine and dandy. If they don&#39;t, and they hear a languange they don&#39;t understand... they can just look up the Words, where the dialogue will be in English (or a language they  know as otherwise catching SPaG errors wouldn&#39;t be possible for them), making the use of a UT, while more comfortable, not necessarily... er... necessary.</p>

            <p>(I mean, obviously I disagree...) A fairly common charge in Middle-earth missions is for a Suvian understanding the language when she really shouldn&#39;t. The assumption there is clearly that the Suvian is speaking Westron (and thus, the agents must be hearing and translating it).<br><br>Or, to put it another way: canon worlds are based on words, too, right? So, since LotR is written in English, that means that Suvians <i>should</i> understand what everyone&#39;s saying, because that&#39;s what appears in the book? And yet... they really shouldn&#39;t, and neither should PPC agents.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>As I said, in-universe Sue was speaking English in an English speaking world (or her own language in her own country) and everyone in Middle-Earth speaks Westron, thought that is &quot;translated&quot; in English for the viewer/reader.<br><br>Then Sue falls in Middle Earth and shouldn&#39;t be able to understand anyone there due to language barrier. That&#39;s how it is supposed to work, on this I obviously agree with you.<br><br>However, the Agents are at least partially meta. They&#39;re not part of the fic, as shown by the fact they can read the Words. They are &quot;inside&quot; the fic, alright, but they pretty much share the readers&#39; viewpoint - that&#39;s what they&#39;re there for after all.<br><br>And they witness everything happening as described by the Words, that often tend to act as a literal genie, like green eyes constantly described as &quot;emeralds&quot; actually becoming emeralds. Using that, and then claiming that the dialogue written in English isn&#39;t literally heard by the Agents in English feels like a contradiction to me.<br><br>And... This is getting very meta.

            <p>I mean, instead of reinforcing the idea of the fic&#39;s badness like exploding CADs (Legolas&#39; so OOC the CAD can&#39;t handle it anymore!), a broken UT takes the focus off the fic and onto malfunctioning equipment.<br><br>To make it mesh well in a mission, we would need to have the fic itself cause the malfunction (argh, this Tenth Walker&#39;s using so much Fangirl Japanese the UT shut itself off!), whuch is not only very situational, but easily remedied until charging time (Hey, we can still read the Words, no problem).<br><br>Then having to neuralyze or talk down canons with no common language will be fun.</p>

            <p>Blood players aren&#39;t actually natural leaders. Karkat and Kankri both failed to push their teams to do anything more than simply not kill each other, and that didn&#39;t last long either. Even the Signless&#39;s movement didn&#39;t actually get very far, if I recall correctly. They&#39;re good mediators and have a knack for fostering alliances, but that isn&#39;t the same as leading.<br><br>By that same token, Light players seem to be more skilled as strategists, with Vriska&#39;s planning and Rose&#39;s ability to see the most fortuitous path.<br><br>However, the Summoner managed to lead a rebellion strong enough to force the Condesce to banish adult trolls from Alternia, everyone seems pretty content to follow John despite his lack of social skills or even the ability to make a basic heroic speech, and Tavros recently managed to somehow show up with a whole army of ghosts in tow. I think the Breath players are the real leaders, as far as actually motivating people to follow them. Breath has been thought of as representing direction or motion in Sburb before, so maybe that extends to directing and/or moving others?</p>

            <p>So the creator of  Hetalia,Hima, has said no producing art or Fanfiction about the Japanese earthquake of 2011.  Would that make hetalia a semi-quarantined  continuum or would this count as something else? </p>

            <p>... it would mean that we wouldn&#39;t do missions into that sort of fanfic, because that would mean writing (derived, but actual) fanfic about the event in question.<br><br>In the PPC universe... dunno. I&#39;m not sure there&#39;s a theoretical foundation for quarantining, unless it&#39;s &#39;authors can create impenetrable creativity shields by author fiat&#39;. Looking at an easier scenario where it&#39;s a specific character who&#39;s forbidden: would the story be missionable except for the scene they appeared in? Would that scene be missionable, but the character is an automatic replacement? Or just a moving void where the forbidden character would be if the badfic could &#39;access&#39; them?<br><br>Probably best not to think about it.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I remember once I read a fic where &#39;Snape&#39; was spelled as &#39;amoe&#39; for some reason. I can see that happening, but only if someone is really, really drunk. I found out that it was supposed to be Snape only after reading the author&#39;s notes, which were spelled even worse in some places. They also insisted on spelling &#39;Harry&#39; as Haray&#39; while claiming that the latter was the British spelling, and that the former was only printed because of some nebulous conspiracy. Yes, really.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m sure most of you guys know <i>Will You Press the Button?</i>. It&#39;s a website game which gives you an option of something great and wonderful (e.g. &#39;You own a motorcycle that never crashes&#39;) BUT there&#39;s always a catch (e.g. &#39;you can never ride in anything else with wheels, or fly a plane). And now the question is asked, would you press the button to make it happen?<br><br>So, I&#39;ve been playing it for a while now while this question popped out:<br><br><br><br>You will go into the world of your favorite series<br><br>BUT<br><br>You will not be able to interact with your favorite character<br><br><br><br>Now a question for you, darlings... Will You Press the Button? <br><br>Personally, I&#39;m still torn apart because going into the <i>Harry Potter</i> world would be amazing, but not being able to meet and talk to Tonks? NO!

            <p>Considering that right now my favorite fandoms are tied pretty equally between <i>Harry Potter</i> and <i>Doctor Who</i>, I run the risk of ending up in one or the other.<br><br><i>Harry Potter</i>, if I can become a witch for the duration of my stay, then yes, yes, absolutely yes. I wouldn&#39;t be able to keep myself from crying if I met Lupin in real life, so I&#39;m sold.<br><br><i>Doctor Who</i>, on the other hand... considering my favorite character is the Doctor, hands-down, I&#39;d basically end up getting killed off as an extra to show how dangerous the Monster of the Week is. Not getting to be a companion, and never even getting to say thank you for being awesome to the Doctor? I&#39;ll pass.</p>

            <p>Gimme now. <br><br>Upon being chucked into Middle-earth, I wouldn&#39;t be able to interact with Nienna, but that&#39;s not much lost, honestly; she wouldn&#39;t have spoken to me anyways. <br><br>Now, here&#39;s a question: what do I <i>do?</i> I can&#39;t go the classic Mary Sue route and recklessly join the Fellowship (I have no useful skills in a medieval context. Literally none. I can boil water: that&#39;s it), but if I managed not to die straight off I might be able to find a way to Rivendell (hey, it could happen. Maybe. If I have an immense amount of Valar-given luck on my side) and give Elrond some relevant info. Pretend to be a Seer, write down some cool-sounding stuff in private to spout off later as prophecy, and bam! I&#39;m in business. Course, he&#39;d have to trust me, and I hopefully wouldn&#39;t doom all of Middle-earth by getting something wrong and/or changing the plot so much that new and unforeseen dangers overcome the Company, but if all goes well I&#39;ve saved countless lives and might even get to stay with the Elves for a while. Or in Gondor, maybe. Just anyplace remotely civilized.  <br><br>But I&#39;d probably just die; Middle-earth isn&#39;t exactly the safest place in the multiverse. Just watch: I&#39;d get some crucial verb or noun wrong and end up getting myself killed. I&#39;m horrible with foreign languages. <br><br>It&#39;d be totally worth it, though. <sup>_^</sup> <br><br>-Alleb</p>

            <p>Falas seems good to me, although I&#39;ve always wanted to see Gondolin. Gosh, and Doriath too; there&#39;s so much sightseeing to do in Beleriand!

            <p>There&#39;s two ways to answer it: the tourist version, and the Morgoth-junkie version.<br><br><u>Tourist:</u> You&#39;ll want to visit Beleriand during the Siege of Angband, between YSI 60 and 455. To narrow it down more than that, you need to decide what - and who - you want to see.<br><br>-If you&#39;re interested in the Eldar to the exclusion of mortals, try and arrive in ~YSI 63. That will let you sneak in a quick visit to Nevrast before Turgon leaves for Gondolin the following year. You can spend four years hearing Quenya spoken before Thingol bans it in 67; you should probably pay your visit to Doriath in this time period, too, since Thingol gets a lot more wary after that.<br><br>Then you have a bit of a wait. Most of the Elven cities are built by this time, so wander where you will, but keep an eye on the calender. You&#39;ll be pretty old by 102, when Finrod finishes Nargothrond, but you ought to make it. If you can manage to latch onto Turgon&#39;s group between then and 116 - by which time you&#39;ll have spent about 50 years in Beleriand - you can possibly live out your twilight years in Gondolin itself.<br><br>-If you&#39;re interested in mortal men, come in a bit later - during the Long Peace (260-455). I recommend timing your arrival to shortly before 355 - that way you can meet Beor before he dies. You&#39;ll have a lot to look forward to - Andreth the Wise will be born in 361, so you can meet her in her prime; Haleth the axe-wielding chieftan was born in 341, and in 375 she will claim leadership of one of the Houses of Men. Er, try not to be in their camp when that happens. Also, try not to be anywhere near Estolad and House Beor in 369, when Bereg gets tricked by Morgoth.<br><br>This timeframe won&#39;t let you visit the mortal realms of Dorthonion (founded 410) and Dor-lomin (416), unless you&#39;re very luck. The last major event you&#39;re likely to get a chance to see is Aredhel&#39;s return to Gondolin in 400 - and actually, if you can follow them, you might be able to sneak in yourself. If not, you can still witness the birth of Barahir, father of Beren.<br><br>As an alternative to the above, if you show up in the late 300s, you can still meet everyone except Beor himself. You can visit Dor-lomin and Dorthonion, witness the conversation of Finrod and Andreth, meet Beren (born 432) as a child, and maybe just about meet Hurin (441), Morwen (443), Huor (444) and Rian (450). But then you&#39;re risking being around for the Sudden Flame... not really recommended.<br><br>Unless, of course, you&#39;re a...<br><br><u>Morgoth Junkie</u>: You want to arrive in 453. Make a lightning tour of Beleriand, but be absolutely sure to be in Barad Eithel (Fingon&#39;s fortress) for 455. You will have a front-row seat for the Battle of Sudden Flame, and receive eyewitness accounts of the death of Fingolfin. You will, admittedly, be trapped in Hithlum for the next 17 years, but, y&#39;know, sacrifices.<br><br>Next up, join Fingon&#39;s army by 472. You can be present at the Nirnaeth Arnoediad, and then choose your future: either join up with Orodreth&#39;s army from Nargothrond, or (when he shows up) with Turgon. Either way, you get a decent chance of retreating to a hidden city - which you then get to watch be destroyed! Well, you can definitely survive to the fall of Nargothrond in 495, and perhaps move on to Doriath to see the Battle of the Thousand Caves in 503 (and even the Second Kinslaying in 506!); it&#39;ll be a little harder if you choose the Gondolin route, because you&#39;ll have to live until 510, a full 57 years after your arrival. If you do go that way, make sure to befriend Idril, so she can show you the secret way out!<br><br>Regrettably, there is no way for you to live long enough to witness the Third Kinslaying at the Havens of Sirion, or the War of Wrath. Sorry about that. <sup>_<sup><br><br>hS</sup></sup></p>

            <p>I mean, my favourite character in Middle-earth is probably Finrod Felagund, but that&#39;s fine - there&#39;s loads of other stuff to do. But... there have been several convincing arguments made that <i>Middle-earth itself</i> is the main character of large parts of Tolkien&#39;s writing, and if so, it&#39;s definitely my favourite. In which case I&#39;d just get chucked into the Void to hang out with Morgoth, or maybe (if the button is feeling nice) onto Vingilot to chill with Earendil. Neither of which are worth the trouble.<br><br>(Also, does the button let you come <i>back</i>?

            <p>I&#39;m leaning more toward pressing the button - after all, as others have said before me, actually meeting a favourite character would most likely result in a lot of unwanted awkwardness (and that&#39;s in a best case scenario), so it probably wouldn&#39;t be that much of a loss.<br><br>However, it also depends on exactly where and when you end up in the world: for example, my favourite series at the moment would probably be <i>Doctor Who.</i> However, if I were to press that button, and then simply ended up in modern-day Earth (with no way off it, given that it&#39;s impossible for me to interact with the Doctor, and presumably his companion(s))... well, that would probably make for a rather disappointing  experience.

            <p>It might still be interesting to see how Hogwarts looks to a Muggle (supposed I can find the place), or to find out whether I can see the Leaky Cauldron when I know that it&#39;s right there in front of me, between the big book shop and the record shop. But would this justify abandoning my family in case I can&#39;t return?<br><br>Considering that the <i>Harry Potter</i> books don&#39;t exist in the Potterverse, not being able to interact with my favourite character probably manifests as not even remembering her existence, or anything else Potterverse-Muggle-me couldn&#39;t have read in the non-existing books. So I might not even know what I wanted to look for. <br><br>That&#39;s a big catch.<br><br>HG, reluctantly walking away</p>

            <p>Being unable to meet my favorite character? Not a problem; as already said, you can have your own adventures and experience for yourself those things that make the world so great (unless it&#39;s one of those worlds where the greatness is character-driven, such as mystery stories). The major question is whether I&#39;d have the wherewithal to handle the dangers of the world. (For example, Pokйmon can be scary, you know? A dog that can give you a burn whose pain will never go away? Dream-eating, child-kidnapping tapirs?) As long as I can survive in that world, *presses button*.</p>

We turned into <i>monsters</i>. Even if the Doctor tries to save everyone, I&#39;m not sure if...&quot; His voice trailed off. He looked away, then back at the computer screen. &quot;Then there&#39;s the question of the Hybrid thing running about which I don&#39;t like. And then we don&#39;t know if Rassilon is still alive and kicking...&quot;<br><br>&quot;<font><font size="2">Are you not excited about this?</font></font>&quot; asked Terabyte, its combat platform standing behind the Guardsman, looking over his shoulder at the computer screen. &quot;<font><font size="2">You have the chance to see your sister again...</font></font>&quot;<br><br>&quot;Well, Emiran has got a point,&quot; said Naya, who was also standing behind the Gallifreyan man. &quot;His people aren&#39;t safe yet. There&#39;s still the question of where Gallifrey is, what happened to all the Daleks on the planet during the Moment, what&#39;s the current political situation, and well... what Moffat will do to milk the drama. It&#39;s the season finale too-- there&#39;s bound to be a cliffhanger for Series 10.&quot;<br><br>&quot;So yeah. Not feeling particularly optimistic about this. And then the stupid Continuity Council is gonna be all over this too...&quot; The Guardsman sighed and rubbed his eyes. &quot;It&#39;s going to be a long month.&quot;<br><br>&quot;<font><font size="2">What will you do once Gallifrey comes back?</font></font>&quot; asked Terabyte.<br><br>&quot;I don&#39;t know. I really don&#39;t know. I fought for over three millennia in the biggest SNAFU of a war to see Gallifrey at peace again and now I learn that my homeworld might still be in danger.&quot; His eyes wandered over to the corner of his RC where there stood a locker filled with the equipment and armour he had brought into HQ when he arrived via Time Vortex. &quot;And if there&#39;s still a danger... well, I&#39;m <i>technically</i> still in the armed forces. I have an obligation to the homeworld.&quot;<br><br>&quot;You are <i>not</i> going back in there,&quot; said Naya forcefully, grabbing her partner&#39;s shoulder. &quot;Especially not when Gallifrey&#39;s return is being hyped as a game-changer. <i>We</i> are going to patiently wait it out and make a calculated decision based on what the two episodes are going to tell us. Isn&#39;t that right, TB?&quot;<br><br>&quot;<font><font size="2">Acknowledged. Caution is advised,</font></font>&quot; said the geth, also putting a hand on the Guardsman&#39;s shoulder. &quot;<font><font size="2">We just have to wait and see.</font></font>&quot;<br><br>The Guardsman sighed and looked blankly at the tool rack hanging on the wall in front of him. &quot;Yeah.

            <p>It is kinda creepy to shoot well-meaning newbie gifts. I mean, OK, if it would have been the face-eating tea, but a couple sharp feathers? A plushie? I think agigabyte kinda overreacts here. It looks like a... hostile mindset (let&#39;s go with that) to me.</p>

            <p>So - just to be clear, here - you consider that writing attempted-humorous destruction of some (pretend) feathers, (pretend) spikes, and (pretend) SPaGhetti, eating of (pretend) chocolate, and moving-to-another-location of a (pretend) plushie is justification for the hostile environment created for this new member of the PPC community by (in no particular order) Hardic, Darkotas, Iximaz, and yourself?<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I&#39;m also kinda put off by this newbie&#39;s reactions to their newbie gifts. In my case, the reason is that what&#39;s meant as a friendly, welcoming gesture is being met in what appears to be a spirit of mistrust, rejection, and destruction. Even if you add &quot;pretend&quot; to all the above, it&#39;s still pretty rude to the people who were being genuinely nice.<br><br>On the other hand, getting offended at humor based on the death of fictional characters is definitely a bit silly, coming from PPCers.

            <p>My reaction to the gifts being destroyed was more along the lines of &quot;Um. Oookay?&quot; I thought it was odd, but it didn&#39;t upset me.<br><br>Joking about redshirts being killed, fine. It happens often enough in canon that we recognize it does, and we laugh about it. Joking about killing redshirts because they&#39;re going to die anyway, though? Really rubbed me the wrong way, especially by saying they&#39;re not real and therefore it doesn&#39;t matter. Yes, they&#39;re not real, but neither are mini-Boarders, and that went over so well <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=273655;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">last time someone killed them for fun</a>. It&#39;s less about &#39;OH NOES THEY&#39;RE KILLING FICTIONAL CHARACTERS&#39; as it is what those characters represent. We laugh at killing Sues because the Sues represent a Bad Thing. Redshirts are characters whose only purpose is to show how dangerous the Monster of the Week is, so what does it mean when we go out and kill them for fun?<br><br>It&#39;s more about the mindset behind the words that worries me. I did try to ask them to stop <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=286425;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">less harshly</a> and flat-out told them to stop when they didn&#39;t; I realize now I could have been gentler, and for that, I apologize, but I don&#39;t apologize for asking them to stop at all. Maybe I did get wound up over nothing, but it reminded me the logic used by my old bullies. &quot;She&#39;s not a real person, so it doesn&#39;t matter what we say/do to her.&quot; It struck a very unpleasant nerve with me.<br><br>But again, I do apologize for my harshness. It won&#39;t happen again.</p>

            <p>For what little my input may be worth, it wasn&#39;t that the jokes concerning redshirts didn&#39;t work, it was that they didn&#39;t work in such a way that left me a little bit uneasy.

Telling me to rephrase what I say I understand, telling me I said things in a bad/offensive way I also get — I&#39;m fully aware that I make mistake and I&#39;m not bothered by being told as much (like this post does) — but being told to (effectively) shut up, I don&#39;t like.

            <p>An &quot;organic central computer&quot; is basically what a brain <i>is</i>. B1s are shown to be sentient at several points in <i>Star Wars</i>; so, for that matter, are droids in general.<br><br>Perhaps an analogy that better expresses your point would be the vodun zombie (rather than the George A. Romero or Infected types from various films); a lurching, debatably sentient ex-person raised to serve the will of a single individual. This doesn&#39;t apply to security personnel in Starfleet any more than it applies to Clone Troopers, or Cylons, or any other mook organizations you&#39;d care to mention. They are sentient lifeforms. Even at their worst, they deserve compassion and rehabilitation, not a one-way ticket to an abattoir.<br><br>But then, maybe I&#39;m overthinking this. If LotD has redshirts knocking around as an expendable slave race (like how the 4GBHE thinks of the Ood in <i>Doctor Who</i>) then, well, I can&#39;t really stop them from having one. It definitely skeeves me out, though, and while it could just be my deeply-held pacifist beliefs talking, I&#39;d rather not have to find out.</p>

            <p>Organic <i>central</i> computer - as in, not in the specific body.

            <p>If it&#39;s a puppet thing, that&#39;s... kind of how I imagine hive minds working. A superorganism with multiple individual bodies.

            <p>Also, I haven&#39;t read <i>Ender&#39;s Game</i> in forever because doing so would involve either chasing down a copy in a local library or buying one, and frankly the latter is too much work to even tacitly support that ghastly bloody man. One assumes that Formics wasn&#39;t the name they gave themselves, though, because it&#39;s obviously derived from <i>formica<i>, the Latin word for cheaply-made kitchen surfaces. =]<br><br>Back on topic, the Culture doesn&#39;t do that with drones because it&#39;s really not what they do at all; drones is really kind of the wrong term anyway. The closest analogy I can think of is the Special Circumstances combat suits that show up from time to time. They&#39;re sentient alife, but they live in a suit, and they have amazing reaction times and 3D vision and all the kind of stuff you&#39;d expect from an immensely advanced civilization like the Culture. They&#39;re not <i>quite</i> ablative armour, but remember that the Culture&#39;s language, Marain, deliberately doesn&#39;t really have <i>words</i> for that kind of concept, plus they&#39;re innately pacifist space hippies who can Get Dangerous quite quickly in the grand tradition of Darkwing Duck. =]</i></i></p>

            <p>Agents Min Ra and Effie Raptor, Department of Geographical Aberrations<br><br>Min Ra is a firebender from an Avatar: The Last Airbender RP. Since the RP was set long before the show, she uses the &#39;fire is life&#39; form of firebending. This is her bio from the RP: <br><br>Personality: Min Ra revels in power. She likes firebending, and she likes being physically the best. Safety is kind of a secondary concern, although she does take some steps toward safety, and dislikes endangering the safety of others too much (if they endanger themselves through doing something stupid, they&#39;re (mostly) on their own). Although Min doesn&#39;t like to admit it, she really does care a lot about her friends, and she will help them out whenever they&#39;re in danger.<br>Backstory/History/Bio: Min was born to an army officer and his wife, and she got her perfectionism from her father. She was trained in the art of firebending and martial combat (and other such things) by her father, but mostly, she led an ordinary life. Her parents were good ones, and she still loves them (even if she does have a scar on her leg from one of her and her father&#39;s duels; it was a mistake, and he apologized).<br><br>Effie Raptor: <br><br>Her name is short for F-22 Raptor, as Effie is an anthropomorphisation of that kind of plane, based off the following picture: <br><br><a href="http://www.pixiv.net/member_illust.php?mode=medium&amp;illust_id=2431623"><a href="http://www.pixiv.net/member_illust.php?mode=medium&amp;amp;illust_id=2431623">http://www.pixiv.net/member_illust.php?mode=medium&amp;amp;illust_id=2431623</a></a><br><br>How Effie got to the PPC is a funny story involving plotholes, a nickname of &#39;Mary Sue with Wings&#39; from TV Tropes, a few rookie agents, and a hilarious misunderstanding. Effie joined the PPC because, as a military jet, she feels at her best when she&#39;s using martial powers to serve a good cause. <br><br>Effie&#39;s personality is cool and efficient. She is technical-detail-oriented, so if faced with, say, a Single Tear, she&#39;d comment on its biological unlikeliness rather than its status as a cliche. Effie is very good at math, and very much obsessed with accuracy, because mistakes at 60,000 feet mean really big problems. She&#39;s continuously bothered by her inability to catch the more subtle and emotional signs of Sueism.<br><br>Effie has a hard time deciding whether to think of herself as a human or as a plane, and sometimes she&#39;ll refer to parts of her body with aircraft terminology (confusing the **** out of her partner). Because of this, she lacks initiative, often waiting for a human to take the controls. Unfortunately, her partner is unfamiliar with machines, which leads to some problems. <br><br>Effie always carries around several kinds of missiles, which are very useful for blowing up anything Suvian that&#39;s too big for melee weapons. She&#39;s also quite fast and agile, and surprisingly stealthy for someone wearing airplane wings on her back. However, she&#39;s used to ranged combat and is terrible at melee. </p>

            <p>I mean, I can think of two reasons why I like the picture of her that you posted, but it might be more fun to have her as, y&#39;know, an actual talking plane. I can think of at least three reasonable jokes involving that, and you can always break out the Disguise Generator for missions with no facility for air combat. Also, did the F-22 ever have a2g missiles as part of its complement of explodey death bits? Because I can&#39;t remember if it did, and it might be important for her character; I can&#39;t see someone as perfectionist of bent as Effie using air-to-air weapons on a grounded target without an ungodly amount of prodding and/or life-threatening situations. =]</p>

            <p>It&#39; mostly because she&#39;s inspired by this comment on the Moe Anthropomorphism TvTropes page: <br><br>&quot;The F-22 Raptor earned the nickname &quot;Mary Sue With Wings&quot; here on This Very Wiki.&quot;<br><br>The idea was bascially that a rookie agent heard the nickname and overreacted by attempting to mission her. Because she wasn&#39;t actually a Sue, he couldn&#39;t kill her, and she ended up being recruited instead. <br><br>While I do plan to have her spend stints as a talking plane (after all, she is somewhat confused as to what type of being she is), there&#39;s the problem of who would fly her. Her partner Min Ra is from a medieval Asian setting and thus has had no training in how to fly aircraft.  <br><br>And according to the Holy Land of Quick Research, Wikipedia,<br><br>&quot;The F-22 can also carry air-to-surface weapons such as bombs with Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) guidance and the Small-Diameter Bomb, but cannot self-designate for laser-guided weapons. Internal air-to-surface ordnance is limited to 2,000 lb. An internally mounted M61A2 Vulcan 20 mm cannon is embedded in the right wing root with the muzzle covered by a retractable door to maintain stealth. The radar projection of the cannon fire&#39;s path is displayed on the pilot&#39;s head-up display.&quot;<br><br>In layman&#39;s terms, I think that means &quot;yes&quot;.</p>

        <div class="post-body">
            <p>Good evening to you all! <sup>_<sup><br><br>Seeing</sup></sup> as a lot of you who work in the DMS, including a significant number outside of the Video Games division specifically, are followers and fans of Nintendo-related continua, I trust that you are aware of, among other recent Nintendo-related news, the recent announcement that <a href="http://metro.co.uk/2015/11/12/nintendo-announce-twilight-princess-hd-and-cloud-strife-for-super-smash-bros-5497864/">Cloud Strife from <i>Final Fantasy 7</i> has been added to the <i>Super Smash Bros</i> character roster</a>. On top of this, a new Nintendo Direct centered around SSB will be shown next month, hopefully giving us the remaining few fighters that will be added (or added back) into the game. As expected, a lot of us, myself included, are more than a little excited for this development, and I certainly hope to see people put this archetypical ex-soldier to good use once he is released along with the latest DLC content!<br><br>Unfortunately, there is one repercussion stemming from this development that even my partner (or his canon counterpart, for that matter) couldn&#39;t see, and that is how polarizing this new development has become. A lot of Smash Bros. fans have been upset over Cloud&#39;s inclusion, citing plenty of reasons such as his being a supposed Ike clone, another swordsman, or belonging to a game that never received a Nintendo console port. A good number have also speculated that he was the winner of the Smash Ballot which ended several months ago, thus crippling the chances of Shovel Knight, Shantae, or King K. Rool being playable. (I personally voted for Sceptile and Bandanna Dee, but that&#39;s beside the point.)<br><br>I personally believe a lot of those arguments are baseless for several reasons. First, the <i>Final Fantasy</i> series originated with Nintendo console releases before moving to PlayStation, with the original even being released on the NES. Second, <a href="http://thelifestream.net/weekly-famitsu-issue-no-1224-yoshinori-kitase-interview/">developer Yoshinori Kitase stated in a 2008 interview that FF7 was itself planned for release on the Super Nintendo console prior to its being moved to the N64 and finally the Playstation</a>, so the Nintendo consoles do have relevance for this game to some degree. And third, Cloud&#39;s moveset, while derivative of some of the preexisting characters in the roster, I don&#39;t believe he will be a clone of anyone necessarily. It takes four months for a playable character to be completed including the moveset, so the fact that Cloud, like Mewtwo and Ryu, took that long to be developed suggests that he will play as his own character rather than a slightly altered copy of anyone else.<br><br>Therefore, while I understand why some of you may not be taking his reveal so well, it&#39;s important to realize that he and his home franchise have more history with Nintendo than you think. Besides, we still have the December Direct to look forward to, so hopefully we&#39;ll get to know the true winner of the Smash Ballot by then.<br><br>Naturally, a lot of you agents will be asking what this announcement means for <i>Super Smash Bros.</i> fanfic and badfic, and future missions therein. I believe that Cloud&#39;s addition, as controversial as it is, will likely result in a resurgence of fanfics featuring him now that his appearance in Smash is canon. Our treatment of him in a mission will likewise be different in light of the announcement, especially because information about him is still forthcoming. It&#39;s important to keep in mind that Cloud has appeared in plenty of SSB fanfic prior to his official reveal, so in the weeks and months to come, we would do best to check the date when the fic being missioned was published. If it was written prior to the announcement date (November 12, 2015), then it would be better to send him back to his home continuum. For fics published after that, however, I guess he&#39;s allowed to stay with the rest of the Smash fighters. That&#39;s my personal judgement on the matter, though - perhaps more information will be needed before we can cement his status in SSB missions.<br><br>As it is, however, this is truly a time to be alive, and Cloud&#39;s inclusion in SSB will certainly open more figurative doors for both this game and the <i>Final Fantasy</i> franchise, what with a remake of FF7 in the works. I know it may be a stretch to say that the entire Smash fandom will eventually embrace him, but I hope that he will come to be accepted as a fighter by the fans of SSB - and you agents as well - in the times ahead!<br><br>Now if you&#39;ll excuse me, I need to tend to my partner... He&#39;s too busy squeeing and flailing about on the floor to speak. Take care!<br><br>- Agent Whitney, who is cautiously shipping Cloud with Linkle from the upcoming <i>Hyrule Warriors</i> 3DS port.</p>

            <p>Eh.  Fanbrats will be fanbrats, but in a game like <i>Smash Bros.</i>, it&#39;s better to have a big roster.  Ike clone?  UnlIkely.  (Hee.)  Just <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v_MdaIHOtk">look at how</a> he moves.  He is probably a heavy character, but his attacks come out waaaaay faster than Ike&#39;s.<br><br>I do wish his Final Smash wasn&#39;t identical to Ike&#39;s, and Robin&#39;s, and Greninja&#39;s, and the Mii Brawler&#39;s, though.  I mean, Cloud does have access to magic spells; I know it&#39;s not what Cloud himself is famous for, but considering this is probably <i>Final Fantasy</i>&#39;s only representation in SSB, it would have been nice to see more represented.  Cloud&#39;s Final Smash could have been casting Mini on everyone (Poison Mushroom effect), using Demi3 to reduce jumping ability of opponents (though maybe only when over the ground, so recovery doesn&#39;t become impossible), Confu to reverse directional controls, or Berserk to remove jumping, dodging, and shielding for a set time.  Or, to be dull, just cast Comet or Ultima!  He could also have used a summon—not the ones on the Midgar stage, obviously,  but there are plenty of others in FF7.  Shiva, Titan and Typhon all would have looked super-cool, and Choco/Mog would have been just fantastic!  But the absolute best would have been <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heL6FCojAbI">Knights of Round</a>.  That would look <i>amazing</i>, if they all attacked the stage in different ways, one after another.  (Also, watching that again, I&#39;m disappointed Omnislash doesn&#39;t make a little &quot;9999&quot; damage count appear above the targets&#39; heads!  At least it has the original title box show up.)<br><br>Ultimately, though, I&#39;m happy to see yet another canon represented in SSB.  The more variety, the better!  And now I can Smash Run to a couple of FF songs!  I have the 3DS version, so I&#39;ll only be getting two.  :(  Probably that remix of &quot;Opening - Bombing Mission&quot; from the trailer, and either the original &quot;Let the Battles Begin!&quot; or &quot;Fight On!&quot;, both also in the trailer.  I&#39;d be happy with either of those, so long as I don&#39;t get &quot;One-Winged Angel.&quot;  That song is so over-hyped, though I&#39;m sure it will be on the Wii U in some fashion.  I do hope music from FFs other than VII are there, too; I know Cloud + Midgar pretty much hints at all FF7 representation, but like I said, this may be the only time we get <i>Final Fantasy</i> in SSB, and it would be nice to see some music from other titles appear.  The actual &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; theme deserves a gorgeous remix, since it&#39;s shown up in most of the series&#39; games, and they could easily have something from <i>Dissidia Final Fantasy</i> as well, since Cloud appeared in that.<br><br>Speaking of <i>Dissidia</i>, the two costumes shown in Cloud&#39;s trailer (standard and <i>Advent Children</i> outfits) were also in DFF, so I&#39;m hoping his third costume from that game, the <i>Kingdom Hearts</i> gear, is in SSB too.  I&#39;d also like Cloud to get a pink color change of Lightning&#39;s outfit from <i>Final Fantasy XIII</i>, since Lightning was modeled after Cloud.  And because pink Cloud.  :3<br><br>And also speaking (two paragraphs ago) of over-hyped, yes, Cloud is way too popular, and shows up everywhere, and I definitely would have preferred a lesser known character getting the spotlight, like the Onion Knight from FF3, who I love using in <i>Dissida</i>, or Garland, the villain from the first <i>Final Fantasy</i>.  But again, I&#39;m just glad the series is getting representation in <i>Smash</i> at all, and I suspect Cloud is the winner of the write-in ballot, even though they didn&#39;t say so, and that&#39;s just kind of how popularity contests work.<br><br>Anyway, the rumor is there&#39;s still room for two more characters, and two more stages (and therefore more music!).  Who/where/what songs are you hoping to get?<br><br>((—doctorlit turns out to a massive, rampaging fanboy.  He isn&#39;t sorry.))</p>

            <p>Mine are just the &quot;really feeling it&quot; kind, that&#39;s all. (Sigh...)<br><br>And for the record, Cloud isn&#39;t just any RPG protagonist - he&#39;s practically the face of the <i>Final Fantasy</i> franchise as a whole, and his game may well be <i>the entire bloody reason</i> that RPGs have become as popular as they are now. Heck, my home continuum might not have even existed if it weren&#39;t for him! You can imagine why I&#39;m so excited for his inclusion, incoming badfic explosions aside of course.<br><br>And like Whitney said, we still have that December announcement and like, five more characters to watch out for. Call me hypocritical, but I&#39;d be happy to see some more variety in fighting styles myself - which is why I&#39;m personally hoping the Inklings from <i>Splatoon</i> make it in someday! But eh, no pressure.<br><br>Also, funny how you mentioned &quot;slash&quot; fic, what with that giant sword of his. Though knowing how the Smash fandom is, I wouldn&#39;t be surprised at all.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m sure Final Fantasy is a terrific franchise (haven&#39;t played it yet, they&#39;re all on Playstation). I just have this bad image of its fandom for some reason. Let&#39;s hope the game stays balanced when he arrives. <br><br>(Also, now I&#39;m imagining Kirby with an Inkling&#39;s hairdo, and it&#39;s beautiful. LOL)</p>

            <p>I guess this is an......an introduction of some sorts?<br><br>Yep. I am a random silverfish who had sneaked into this place, slowly, slowly......<br><br>Personally, I was attracted to the PPC Wiki due to the fact that I was severely traumatized by badfics before, but that is a story for another d......dammit.<br><br>I am a fan fiction writer myself, though I had never written one in English before as my native language is Chinese. <br><br>And there were tons of badfics, Bleepfics, even Lengendary Badfics in many of the online Chinese forums. With no warnings in the titles and summaries. <br><br> And as an innocent noob who happened to take her first step into the chaotic and mysterious world of fandoms a few years ago, I decided to read up a few fanfictions.<br><br> And got brutally mind-raped by them.<br><br> And I decided to read more to search for some good ones.<br><br> And finally ended up being traumatized to the point of having phobia of almost all sexual scenes, even in goodfics. Unless it was written in a believable, subtle and skilful manner......<br><br> A masochist? Probably.<br><br> So,I do hate badfics, and there were people bashing Mary Sues and Bad Slash in the Chinese fandom, but it was usually just torturing a weakened!Sues to the point that the abusers themselves became Mary Sues, and they insulted the author a lot.<br><br> There was goodfics about Mary Sues, done in a humorous manner just to tease them, and only focus on the Sues, not the authors. <br><br> However, the anti-sue community overall just don&#39;t suit me, so I left and started searching for more disciplined and smaller fandoms with better quality.<br><br> That was how I got into the Happy Tree Friends, SCP Foundation(My favourite one so far), and Fallout fandoms. HTF is not a small fandom, and there are still badfics in it, but the goodfics in it are awesome.<br><br> Finally, in that one fateful day, I found the PPC Wiki through a random search for fan fiction tutorial. A quiet, almost unnoticed, yet great place.<br><br> After silently read through the pages on Wiki for about three months, I am ready to be part of the community. <br><br> That was all I had to say. My grammar and spelling are pretty bad, and one of the reasons I came here is to improve my English writing skill, so correct me if I made any mistakes in my naggings. I expected a lot of them.<br><br> </p>

I also happen to be Chinese as well (although I&#39;ve spent the vast majority of my life in Singapore), and so please feel free to talk to me in Chinese instead of English sometimes if it makes you more comfortable. :-) Fair warning though, my language skills are a wee bit rusty in some areas, so I might have to ask for clarification sometimes.<br><br>Once again, welcome, and I hope you enjoy being on the Board!</p>

Ralts, however... okay, I love Ralts, I think it&#39;s adorable and has the cutest lil pudding-basin haircut in history, but Ralts is garbage competitively. Its stats are godawful.

            <p>I do not do this often, but I would ask that you guys keep the people of Paris in your thoughts and prayers.  I have family living there, they are fine, but still leaves me a bit worried.  Thanks.</p>

            <p>It&#39;s definitely a sobering thing. <br><br>One of my cousins on my dad&#39;s side used to ride one of the lines of the underground in London that got attacked a few years back; it was only complete luck that had him not commuting that morning. <br><br>As for this attack...<br><br>This won&#39;t stop. They have no interest in being reasoned with. The goal is true terrorism- to create and sustain an environment of fear. <br><br>All any of us can do is to not let it stop us from living, where ever we are, and to continue doing what we do. To do otherwise lets them know they are succeeding at creating a world of fear.<br><br>Instead of prayers and thoughts, I&#39;ll make sure to stand a proper watch.<br><br>-July, in the gulf</p>

            <p>Well, you can find out, even if you&#39;re not on Pottermore. Here&#39;s how:<br><br>1. <a href="http://pottermore.wikia.com/wiki/Ollivanders_Bespoke_Wand_Selector">Go here</a> to read through the wand test. Record your answers to each of the seven questions.<br><br>2. Use <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UAZ59lsiqap1pQAAjr1ncy589LLHtHfoxyfFCrYqPGY/edit?hl=de#gid=9">this spreadsheet</a> to find your wand wood, core, length, and flexibility. Note that there are tabs for each aspect at the bottom of the form—you don&#39;t have to try to use the comprehensive sheet.<br><br>3. Find out what it all means on the Pottermore wiki. Here are the <a href="http://pottermore.wikia.com/wiki/Wand_Woods">Wand Woods</a>, <a href="http://pottermore.wikia.com/wiki/Wand_Cores">Wand Cores</a>, and <a href="http://pottermore.wikia.com/wiki/Wand_Lengths_%26_Flexibility">Wand Length &amp; Flexibility</a> pages.<br><br>4. Tell us what you got!<br><br>I ended up with hazel, dragon heartstring, 12 inches, hard. Fair enough, I guess.<br><br>And then I did my agents, too, because of course I did:<br><br>Nume - Ebony, phoenix feather, 14-1/2 inches, unyielding.<br><br>Ilraen - Rowan, unicorn hair, 10-3/4 inches, unbending.<br><br>Derik - Laurel, unicorn hair, 13-1/2 inches, supple.<br><br>Gall - Sycamore, dragon heartstring, 9-3/4 inches, brittle.<br><br>Jenni - Beech, unicorn hair, 12-1/4 inches, pliant. (Trivia: back in my RPing heyday, I chose rowan wood and unicorn hair for Jenni&#39;s wand. It&#39;s still a good choice, but I like beech, too. My original run through the test for Jenni gave ash, which I don&#39;t like much [though rowan is a variety of ash, so there&#39;s that], so I cheated a bit to come up with beech. I also considered apple, but beech is the more honest of the two.)<br><br>Henry - Hazel, phoenix feather, 13-3/4 inches, hard. (Dang, that&#39;s gonna be a temperamental wand. Just like its owner. Granted, he&#39;s not eligible to get one for a few years yet...)<br><br>So, how about you? {= D<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Because I realized that reading the analyses is half the fun. {= )<br><br><u>Nume</u><br><br>Height: Tall<br>Eyes: Gray<br>Birthday: Even<br>Trait: Intelligence<br>Path: Castle<br>Fear: Darkness (metaphorical darkness, i.e. darkness of the mind, in this case)<br>Artifact: Bound Scroll<br><br>Wand: Ebony, phoenix feather, 14.5&quot;, unyielding.<br><br>So. Ebony owners are &quot;frequently non-conformist, highly individual or comfortable with the status of outsider&quot; and also those who have a strong sense of purpose, from which they are not easily swayed. It&#39;s a good thing that fits Nume to a T, because with a phoenix feather core and unyielding quality, this wand is not an easy one to master. Like its owner, it is aloof and difficult to please, but once won over, it will readily go into battle with you and may surprise you with its resourcefulness.<br><br><u>Ilraen</u><br><br>Height: Average (in human form, anyway)<br>Eyes: Green<br>Birthday: Even (I used the publication date of &quot;Introducing Ilraen&quot; as my reference for this)<br>Trait: Determination (alas, loyalty is not an option)<br>Path: Sea (also alas, an open field is not an option)<br>Fear: Heights (based on that one incident with stairs, though I&#39;m pretty sure he got over it. Could also be read as not wanting to fall into the trap of Andalite arrogance.)<br>Artifact: Bound Scroll<br><br>Wand: Rowan, unicorn hair, 10.75&quot;, unbending.<br><br>Rowan-wood wands have a reputation for being protective, especially good at defensive magic, and best suited to owners who are both clear-headed and pure-hearted. These qualities are echoed in this wand&#39;s unicorn-hair core, which make it a particularly loyal and reliable partner. Its unbending quality means you will never in a million years convince it to stray to evil purposes.<br><br>It&#39;s the perfect wand for a guy who will stick by his friends through thick and thin and always be there to get their backs in a crisis, even if it seems like he&#39;s out for the count. The wand&#39;s length, being the shortest in the Average column, may indicate that he still has some maturing to do, but his relative innocence and inexperience shouldn&#39;t fool anyone—as Phobos pointed out to me recently, he&#39;s got more backbone than just about anybody else in HQ. <sup>_~<br><br><u>Derik</u><br><br>Height:</sup> Tall<br>Eyes: Hazel (well, they were before one got scarred, and I didn&#39;t like the results when I tested out &quot;blue/green&quot; and &quot;other&quot;)<br>Birthday: Odd (ref. Gerard Butler)<br>Trait: Resilience (he doesn&#39;t actually pride himself on this, but it is what most defines him, IMO)<br>Path: Castle<br>Fear: Isolation<br>Artifact: Dusty Bottle<br><br>Wand: Laurel, unicorn hair, 13.5&quot;, supple.<br><br>Laurel-wood wands demand honor and an active sense of purpose in their owners, and it is these very qualities that keep Derik going at all. Its supple quality and unicorn hair core make this wand a little more forgiving and a little more loyal than it might be otherwise, which is good, because Derik needs a little tolerance on his bad days. Seeing potential thieves get struck by lightning can&#39;t hurt, either.<br><br><u>Gall</u><br><br>Height: Short<br>Eyes: Blue<br>Birthday: Odd (ref. the publication date of &quot;The Girl and Her Dragon&quot;)<br>Trait: Originality (because &quot;being awesome and also better than you&quot; is not an option)<br>Path: Castle (probably to storm it and drink their mead; I originally picked the sea, because Viking, but that didn&#39;t really work)<br>Fear: Isolation (because what&#39;s the point of being awesome if no one&#39;s around to see it?)<br>Artifact: Glittering Jewel<br><br>Wand: Sycamore, dragon heartstring, 9.75&quot; (nine and three quarters, lol), brittle.<br><br>This is a fun one—more fun than elm, which she got with the sea path and would probably never be able to use what with its native dignity and sophistication. Sycamore, on the other hand, is as easily bored as Gall and would similarly thrive in the stimulating, adventurous life of an agent. This is a thrill-seeker&#39;s wand, especially with dragon heartstring as the core. It&#39;s powerful, showy, and practically demands to do something, <i>anything</i>, as long as it&#39;s not dull. Unfortunately, as if it weren&#39;t dangerous enough already, its brittle quality makes it even more prone to accident and error, and when it goes awry, it&#39;ll probably do so with a bang.<br><br><u>Jenni</u><br><br>Height: Average<br>Eyes: Green<br>Birthday: Odd (I&#39;ve always given her birthday as the first day of spring, but I&#39;ve never bothered fixing a date to it)<br>Trait: Optimism (actually makes more sense than kindness, really, considering how much of a nuisance she can make herself)<br>Path: Forest<br>Fear: Isolation<br>Artifact: Golden Key<br><br>Wand: Beech, unicorn hair, 12.25&quot;, pliant.<br><br>If a younger Jenni was a match for a straightforwardly, perhaps simplistically protective rowan wand, it seems as though she&#39;s come into her maturity these days. At twelve and a quarter inches, this wand is the second-longest in the Average column, and beech-wood wands in general look for wisdom and subtlety in their owners. This is a wand for someone who&#39;s been around the block a few times and knows that you can&#39;t just charge in and fix everything, no matter how much you might want to; when it comes to helping others, sometimes less is more. With a unicorn hair core, this is not a showy wand, but it is a reliable one. Its pliant quality says it&#39;s ready to try anything once, as long as it&#39;s not being asked to perform out of ignorance or evil.<br><br><u>Henry</u><br><br>(Let&#39;s pretend he&#39;s eleven...)<br><br>Height: Tall<br>Eyes: Green<br>Birthday: Odd<br>Trait: Intelligence (Age ten: &quot;I can do anything any eleven-year-old can do!&quot;)<br>Path: Castle (Hogwarts nao plzkthx)<br>Fear: Small Spaces (i.e. being held back, prevented from acting)<br>Artifact: Golden Key<br><br>Wand: Hazel, phoenix feather, 13.75&quot;, hard.<br><br>As I said in my original post, this is one temperamental wand, especially in the hands of a kid who&#39;s not quite sure of who the heck he even is yet. Hazel is sensitive to its owner&#39;s emotional state, and Henry is a smart, willful kid with a bit of a temper on him. This wand&#39;s phoenix core means it, too, has a mind of its own, and its hard quality makes it especially difficult to change its mind. Henry&#39;s going to have to work hard at mastering himself before he gets much use out of his wand, but when he does, the world had better watch out, because chances are something amazing is going to come of it.<br><br>... Oh, and as for me?<br><br><u>Neshomeh</u><br><br>Height: Average<br>Eyes: Dark Brown<br>Birthday: Odd<br>Trait: Intelligence<br>Path: Forest<br>Fear: Fire<br>Artifact: Black Glove (Because seriously, what is up with a single glove in here with the rest of this stuff? What kind of magic is it for? Is there another one somewhere? Inquiring minds want to know!)<br><br>Wand: Hazel, dragon heartstring, 12&quot;, hard.<br><br>Like Henry&#39;s wand, mine requires me to be self-aware and maintain control of my emotions if I&#39;m going to accomplish anything. (Since I struggle with depression and anxiety—not to a massive degree, but enough that I often struggle to motivate myself—this is a rather apt metaphor for my life.) With a dragon heartstring core, it&#39;s strongly bonded to me and, when I can get it to work, it is quite powerful. Like me, though, it can sometimes get hung up on its own ideas and may need serious persuasion to try something new. At least, if it does discharge unexpectedly, it&#39;s not likely to be dangerous; less explosive, more scattered; spells may just fizzle out. But I guess I&#39;ll never go thirsty. {; P<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>(Also, hS, Nesh, I would greatly appreciate email replies from both of you at some point.)<br><br>a) 12 3/4&#39;&#39; supple &amp; roped laurel w/ dragon heartstring<br><br>A) is actually for myself! Slash Agent July. So, going by the thing, laurel wands don&#39;t tolerate laziness and are said to not be able to perform dishonorable acts. Dragon heartstring cores tend to learn quickly, and can be temperamental and and capable of flamboyant spells- which goes along with length tending to indicate big personalities and flamboyant styles.<br><br>Anyone else think that sounds off the mark for oneself?<br><br>b) 9 3/4&#39;&#39; slightly springy &amp; carved cypress w/ phoenix feather<br><br>As for b), it&#39;s for Agent JF, who does have some growing to do (still) and forever lacking in maturity and common sense. Phoenix feather cores tend to take initiative and have a great range, and cypress wands go to the bold. And well. She does fit the mark.<br><br>c) 14 1/2&#39;&#39; unbending &amp; ribbed beech w/ unicorn hair<br><br>c) is actually for Library! She&#39;s certainly fairly mature acting, and tends to react with the most sense among any given group of agents for the most part, and is definitely one to stand her ground. There&#39;s a reason that she brooks no argument from July, or from anyone else. She&#39;s even fairly good at getting her way.<br><br>d) 12 1/4&#39;&#39; solid &amp; roped beech w/ phoenix feather<br><br>d) is for Colt, who can be flighty seeming at times- which is more of an act than it really is- but does definitely stick with things. As for wise beyond their years, well, he&#39;s a half elf, and prior to joining the PPC lived among elves, so that gives him an interesting perspective and one he doesn&#39;t quite notice all the time- since by that measure he&#39;s more immature, since half human, when he&#39;s actually behaving he&#39;s one of the more responsible ones in BM.<br><br>e) 14&#39;&#39; reasonably supple &amp; carved beech w/ dragon heartstring<br><br>The &#39;flamboyant and energetic&#39; wand belongs to Gerry, in this case, who&#39;s a bit of an odd duck for the BM lot since she only started doing that because she couldn&#39;t continue with being an assassin any longer. One of these days I really have to write a mission or two for her from before she got forced out. At first glance it might seem like the wands Colt and Gerry have might be better suited to the other, but there&#39;s a reason I generally keep them paired up in stories and RPs like I do; they tend to keep each other going. <br><br>f) 11 1/4&#39;&#39; reasonably supple &amp; carved sycamore w/ unicorn hair<br><br>As for f), that goes to Denny; sycamores are for new experience and adventure, pretty much, and  unicorn hair cores also make for pretty faithful wands. He&#39;s definitely in the PPC for new experiences and is kind of doing an escapist thing, even if he&#39;s not entirely aware of it. :)<br><br>Overall, I definitely find it interesting how well the matches work, for the most part.</p>

            <p>That, honestly, sounds like <i>exactly</i> the wand I&#39;d expect for someone in the military. Well, the old-school, shows-up-in-fiction military, a la knights.

            <p>However, the closest to my answers was Acacia, Phoenix Feather, 14 1/2 Inches, Quite Bendy. <br><br>Unfortunately, this assumes that I&#39;m tall and have brown eyes (I&#39;m actually short and have blue-gray eyes).<br><br>Now, for meaning: Acacia is a &#39;tricky&#39; type of wood that often only works for its owner and withhold their best effects from all but the most gifted.

            <p>Having discovered the tabs at the bottom, here are alterations to my and my potential agents&#39; wands: <br><br>My wood is actually Rowan, not Acacia, and it&#39;s supposed to be 10 inches long, and it&#39;s &#39;surprisingly swishy&#39;, not &#39;quite bendy&#39; (not sure if there&#39;s all that much difference, but oh well).<br><br>Farsight&#39;s wand should be 12 3/4ths inches, and it should be supple.<br><br>Jana&#39;s wand is supposed to be 14 1/4 inches long, and her core should have been Unicorn Hair, and it should be Unyielding. The wood it&#39;s supposed to be made of is Elder, which I don&#39;t think she&#39;d like, as she believes that a special destiny is a Bad Thing (personally, I think Black Walnut more suits her personality, but Elder was the result I got). <br><br>Min Ra&#39;s want should be 12 1/4 inches long, and the wood is supposed to be Sycamore. The wand should be &#39;reasonably supple&#39;.<br><br>Effie Raptor&#39;s wand would actually be made of Ebony, and her core a Phoenix Feather. It should be 14 1/2 inches long.</p>

Yay!<br><br>Za&#39;kiir&#39;s wand wood is fantastic for defensive charms, making such spells especially strong and difficult to break, and best placed &quot;with the clear headed and pure-hearted, but this reputation for virtue ought not to fool anyone - these wands are the equal of any, often the better, and frequently out-perform others in duels.&quot;<br><br>Natalie&#39;s wand wood is the type that takes personality from the owner, and it especially likes &quot;witches and wizards who are skilled tamers of magical beasts, those who possess great gifts in Herbology, and those who are natural fliers.&quot; The combination of unicorn core with this wood is &quot;for those concerned with all manner of justice.&quot; That sure fits her. :)<br><br>The common core between these three wands, the unicorn core, is the core least subject to error, is highly faithful to their first owner, and is the least able to perform Dark Magic.<br><br>All highly interesting!</p>

            <p>That&#39;s... basically going to be a wand that doesn&#39;t want to do <i>anything</i>, but is insanely powerful when it can be persuaded. Fir wands &#39;demand staying power and strength of purpose in their true owners&#39;, while phoenix feather wands &#39;are the pickiest of all the cores in choosing the most suitable owner, and allegiance is often hard-won&#39;. It&#39;s even <i>unyielding</i>, so it really won&#39;t play nice!<br><br>Worryingly, the core/wood/length combo indicates powerful magic with fine control and a fondness for transfiguration... and a tendency to act by itself occasionally. Yeeeeeeah, you&#39;re all going to be turned into cats by the time I get this thing under control. :-/<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Dafydd Illian: 13 1/4&#39;&#39; rigid elm with phoenix feather<br><br>Which means Pureblood! Oh, no, wait, that&#39;s a myth. <sup>_^</sup> Er, dignity, elegance, and general power. (Also, &#39;even or odd birthday&#39;? He picked at random.) This is pretty apt, I think.<br><br>Selene Windflower: 13&#39;&#39; reasonably supple black walnut w/ phoenix feather<br><br>This wand is totally useless. <sup>_~</sup> It &#39;loses power dramatically if its possessor practises any form of self-deception&#39;. Yeah, I don&#39;t think Selene is self-honest enough to learn magic.<br><br>Kaitlyn Jackson: 10 1/2&#39;&#39; solid apple w/ unicorn hair.<br><br>This, again, is perfect. Apple goes to charming idealists with a head for communication, while the unicorn makes her extra-nice and means it won&#39;t be too powerful, but will do what it needs to. A hobbit wand indeed.<br><br>Agent Huinesoron: 14 1/2&#39;&#39; hard pearwood w/ unicorn hair<br><br>This turns out to be virtually identical to Kaitlyn&#39;s - pear is another &#39;nice&#39; wood, &#39;which give of their best in the hands of the warm-hearted, the generous and the wise.&#39; Well... he&#39;s trying. I think Kaitlyn bought it for him as a reward for his attempts to become a nicer person.<br><br>... I think this deserves a ficlet, actually.<br><br><hr>
<br><br>&quot;... what&#39;s this?&quot;<br><br>Kaitlyn shrugged, still holding out the box. &quot;Open it and see.&quot;<br><br>Huinesoron took the gift gingerly. The polished wooden box was long and narrow, with gold trim around the seam. The clasp was worked into a delicate golden flower. The elf passed it from one hand to the other thoughtfully, feeling how light it was.<br><br>Kaitlyn was practically bouncing with impatience. &quot;Come <i>on</i>, open it!&quot;<br><br>Huinesoron smiled slightly - then remembered to make the smile visible (&#39;Hiding your emotions just makes you look even more self-centred than you really are&#39; had been Kaitlyn&#39;s caustic comment). He unclasped the case and flipped the lid up.<br><br>Inside, lying on dark grey velvet, was... &quot;It&#39;s a stick.&quot;<br><br>Kaitlyn folded her arms and glowered.<br><br>Huinesoron tried again. &quot;Er... it&#39;s a <i>nice</i> stick.&quot; He lifted it out, tucking the case under his arm. The wood was a warm golden colour, and one end was  carved into a sort of hilt, with a tracery of geometric patterns. He tapped it against his palm: there was no give in it, though it did sound slightly hollow. &quot;Er... thank you?&quot;<br><br>Kaitlyn&#39;s glare intensified, then she abruptly looked uncertain. &quot;You <i>really</i> have no idea what it is?&quot;<br><br>&quot;No...&quot; Huinesoron examined the stick, turning it over. &quot;Is it an archaeological find, maybe?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Ugh!&quot; Kaitlyn fished in a pocket and pulled out a similar stick, shorter and lighter in colour, with a simpler hilt. &quot;Observe,&quot; she said, flourishing the stick. &quot;<i>Lumos!</i>&quot;<br><br>Huinesoron eyed the suddenly-glowing stick warily. &quot;It&#39;s... a torch?&quot;<br><br>&quot;It&#39;s a wand!&quot; Kaitlyn only barely restrained herself from throwing her stick onto the floor. &quot;You know, like in <i>Harry Potter</i>? I got you a custom Muggle-use wand, all right?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Er... thank you!&quot; Huinesoron tried out another smile. &quot;So what does it... do?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Lots of stuff.&quot; Kaitlyn grabbed his arm and tried to drag him off down the corridor. &quot;Practically any spell from <i>Harry Potter</i> that you can think of.&quot;<br><br>&quot;That isn&#39;t a lot,&quot; Huinesoron pointed out. &quot;By which I mean, it&#39;s sort of none.&quot;<br><br>&quot;That&#39;s what the training is for.&quot; Kaitlyn stopped pulling and frowned up at him. &quot;Seriously, could you be a <i>little</i> easier to drag? This is kind of embarassing.&quot;<br><br><hr>

I&#39;m screwed.<br><br>Wobbles:-<br><i>Maple, Phoenix Feather, 13.25&quot;, Solid</i><br>Good for: Actually, this is a wanderer&#39;s wand, well-suited to someone like Wobbles who enjoys going anywhere that isn&#39;t home.<br><br>Notary:-<br><i>Hazel, Dragon Heartstring, 13&quot;, Unyielding</i><br>Good for: People who have control over their emotions and learn 4 dayz.

Those with an affinity for the magic of the natural world. Again, I swear up, down, and sideways that I didn&#39;t fudge the result. A fitting wand for a loyal servant of the Raven King.<br><br>Commander McCandless:-<br><i>Black Walnut, Dragon Heartstring, 12.75&quot;, Unbending</i><br>Good for: Charms and similar, but only with an owner who is sincere and self-aware. So, that&#39;s the Commander. You spend any time in XCOM, you have to be self-aware, otherwise you are alien plasma bolt-aware.<br><br>Doktor Trollenfisch:-<br><i>Does not have opposable thumbs.</i><br>Ach, nein.</p>

Needless to say, she got swarmed. :D<br><br>It wasn&#39;t without its flaws, unfortunately; while on stage during the costume contest, the hot glue holding the ribs together decided to peel apart and the wiring in her helmet got a bit messed up, so it wasn&#39;t able to open and close automatically like she programmed it to. But lesson learned, she&#39;s taking an emergency hot glue gun for next time. While she was getting her suit off after the contest, one of the judges said that if her costume hadn&#39;t fallen apart onstage, she would have won Best Male Hero. Her face went redder than her suit! <br><br>Yes, I wasted valuable board space to brag about my mom. But I&#39;m freaking proud of her, so nyah. :P<br><br>(Before you ask, Ant-Man is just another congoer who wanted his picture with her.)</p>

            <p>Iron Man is my favourite character from the MCU, mostly because of the design and detail in his suit, and that seems to have captured it damn near perfectly. <br><br>I had a couple of mates at Uni that were into cosplaying, and they did some pretty involved costumes, but they never went to the extent of including electronics and working parts like that.

            <p>She made the suit using <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/What-is-Pepakura-and-how-to-start/">pepakura</a>. Basically, she printed out the pattern she needed on cardstock, used an exacto knife to cut it out, then dabbed superglue on with toothpicks to piece it all together. Then it was covered with resin, fiberglass, and bondo and left to harden. After that, she sanded it to its final shape and painted it. The whole thing&#39;s held together with rare Earth magnets and straps superglued on the inside.<br><br>As for electronics, the suit&#39;s chest and eyes light up. When she bends her wrists up (like she&#39;s going to shoot someone with a repulser beam), the palms also light up and it makes a sound like a missile firing. The helmet can open and close on voice command, and the eyes shut off when it&#39;s opened.<br><br>She was so determined on wiring the suit herself that she actually took programming classes at the local college. <s>And then she liked the class so much she went back for a second degree, but that&#39;s another story</s></p>

            <p>Yeah, it was really, wasn&#39;t it? So I am really glad that I finally got to see it! <br><br>Well, I definitely think that is a good approach. My first mission will be of the &quot; utterly horrying and gut-wrenching&quot; kind, but after that I will try to diversify a  bit. I signed my agents up for Floaters for a reason after all. <br><br>For example, for my second mission, I will do that HP fic I once tried to get you to mission for Drifwood. The Age Regressed!Hermione in that one is more likely to be possessed by a wraith than anything else, so I will get to use the Expecto Patronum exorcism method that I suggested last year. </p>

            <p>Recently, Undertale has taken the internet by storm, with almost every streamer and lets player showcasing the game, and people everywhere insisting that you play it. A fun, rpg ish, bullet hell ish, old school style game that has no real comparison other then Earthbound and Mother 3, it is full of charm and emotion as you delve deeper into thee underground.<br><br>I have been playing the heck out of this game and loving every moment of it. Have you been playing it? If so, let&#39;s talk about it. If not, just get it, play through a bit, and come back. It&#39;s 10 bucks on steam, trust me, you will like it. I know you will. It is not just a game, it is an experience, and I do not say that lightly.<br><br>(Also, it&#39;s how I stave off my wait for Fallout 4. Amazon, just ship the darn Pip Boy Edition already!)</p>

            <p>I followed the entirety of Game Grumps&#39; LP of this game from start to finish, including both the neutral and pacifist endings. This is one of those games that really makes you think before you act rather than just level-grinding your way through every random encounter (and if you do the latter... be prepared to question your choices in life). The characters are also lovable in all their own ways even though not a single one of them is human. Mettaton EX is my husbando, sure, but my favorite character in the entire game has to be Alphys. She&#39;s such an adorkable little dinosaur scientist who actually goes out of her way to try and make friends with you, despite, well... I won&#39;t tell, because SPOILERS. ;)<br><br>Also, this: <a href="http://purplemew.tumblr.com/post/130796302336"><a href="http://purplemew.tumblr.com/post/130796302336">http://purplemew.tumblr.com/post/130796302336</a></a></p>

            <p>I am not usually one to insist this, but stop watching and play for yourself. This game throws such loops and twists, that you just wont get with a lets play. Not properly, anyway. I don&#39;t want to say much (though you probably already know) but I will say this. The game is a program on a computer. And it knows that. And it uses that to play with all kinds of conventions and expectations. Watching after playing? More then fine, that&#39;s what I have been doing myself. Steam Train did a fantastic look at it, as has Dodger. But, for you and everyone else, do please pick it up. At very least to support Toby. $10.

            <p>So I found this fanfic which is about a Hetalia canon,Romano, some how being the personification of Equestria and South Italy at the same time.  <br>The fanfic is called &quot;<a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9566381/1/Southern-Heir">Southern Heir</a>&quot; and poor Romano is replaced by an alicorn stu. <br>Characters in Hetalia are meant to reflect their people and not their leaders and Romano being an Alicorn makes no sense at all. He&#39;d be the most common pony type in Equestria to reflect the population. I&#39;d go on more but I&#39;m not sure everyone would be interested in it. <br><br>However while reading the adventures of Stumano  I couldn&#39;t help but wonder,how bad do fanfics like this get?<br>So what is the strangest thing you&#39;ve guys have seen a fanfic author and/or fan artist do to a poor canon or canons? <br></p>

            <p>While I can&#39;t recall the name of the fic in question (though you could probably find it through some intensive searching online. If you&#39;re a masochist), I do remember that it involved the Tenth Doctor (from <i>Doctor Who</i>) being kidnapped, turned into a vampire, and repeatedly raped and tortured by a possessive!vampire!Master. <br><br>There was also mpreg involved, if my memory serves me correctly. </p>

            <p><a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5732117/1/Not-What-it-Appears">Not What it Appears</a> gives Hermione really neglectful Replaced!parents, which leads to her and Harry getting &quot;rescued&quot; by Dumbledore and McGonagall&#39;s twin non-canon children, who then proceed to use a spell, which is so Glaurunging uncanonical that it is definitely capable of tearing the continuum asunder on its own, to turn them back into babies. <br><br>Now let&#39;s see... Hermione is eight at the start of this mess, which means that we are probably in 1987. <br>The spell turns them into 8 months old babies. So if you add about 10 years you get that... the events of HPSS (which are copied almost word for word) happen in 1997, a full Glaurunging six years later than in canon. Apparently, Voldemort is really patient now. <br><br>This thing also has the highest count of uncanonical relatives that I&#39;ve ever seen: Dumbledore and McGonagall (talk about a crack pairing) have 8 non-canon children, and an untold number of non-canon grandchildren. McGonagall somehow had a son with Glaurunging Voldermort, who also had a son with Bellatrix. Said son then had a child, which gives Voldemort three too many uncanon relatives. And finally, Hermione is the biological daughter of Regulus Black. <br><br>and just for the record, here is the canon shattering spell:  <br><br><p><b>Before me sits a child in shadow.  I call the gods to bring him (her) to the light. Bring forth a new slate and begin again. <br><br>Erase the memories long since black <br>Erase the feelings never to come back <br>I am this child&#39;s father (mother) <br><br>I am this child&#39;s blood <br>From me this child shall learn <br>For me this shall mourn <br>From this day forth this this child is mine forever more <br><br>Return Harry (Hermione) to an age to start again to start anew and bring them to safely to my arms! </b>.</p>     </p>

            <p>Okay first off was this written before or after Dumbledore was officially confirmed gay?

            <p>But perhaps the worst part of this whole mess is that Hermione&#39;s (really OOC) parents outright reject her because they &quot; don&#39;t want to be reminded every day that Hermione is dead. &quot; Look, I unfortunately know from personal expirience what&#39;s like to someone in your family suffering from severe memory loss and it&#39;s definitely not pretty and it can very unsettling, but you can&#39;t just abandon your own child like that. I mean, if you were to substitute the potion for a stroke or trauma-induced amnesia, would they still react like that? <br><br>Oh, then there is this lovely bit of really poorly executed fourth-wall breaking:&quot; Up to now, this narrative has dwealt on Hermione&#39;s plight. The effects of the potion on her. Now, let&#39;s switch to Ron&#39;s. You may remember, and hopefully you do, or you&#39;ve got short term memory loss issues, that the potion was meant to give Ron all the intelligence that Hermione lost. You might have assumed, since Ron&#39;s name was mentioned, literally, only ten times in the last chapter, compared to Hermione&#39;s twenty-four, that maybe since the potion was made so badly, Ron had escaped all its effects. &quot;  <br><br>Also, the author somehow managed to misspell Weasley as Weasly a grand total of ... 16 Glaurunging times!<br></p>

            <p>I thought the whole point of that was the idea of love going /too far/ and becoming stalkerish obsession. From the way I saw it, Homura herself had flanderized her mental image of Madoka so much that she misinterpreted what Madoka said to her, or even subconsciously forced Madoka to say something she could interpret the way she wanted. It&#39;s the whole &#39;sunk cost&#39; fallacy and such, where she&#39;s put so much effort into saving Madoka that she&#39;s utterly convinced herself that Madoka is a perfect, precious thing that needs to be protected instead of a literal god.<br><br>Personally, I always saw the little purple lizard as being the last shred of Homura&#39;s sanity, or good sense, or whatever you want to call it, right before it went splat and Akumura took over.</p>

COonsidering how throrough of an explanation we get abou why Madoka was so powerful in the first place, the &quot;corrupted her soul gem with love instead of despair&quot; thing makes no sense, as the power of a Puella Magi or a Witch is related mostly to the power at the time of the contract AFAIK.<br><br>Let&#39;s not delve in the huge plothole of how the omniscient Madoka didn&#39;t see what was going to happen (&quot;I can see every universe that exist or could have existed&quot;, remember?), or even why Nagisa is even there (she accomplishes very little and is basically just Charlotte fans pandering)<br><br>Frankly, the movie feels almost like deliberate fan trolling IMHO, and a direction that should not have been taken. Homura&#39;s seen Hell already, before Rebellion she was already broken and barely held together by paper tape.<br><br>Was there any need to put her into a grinder, so the resulting dust was something that cannot be defined as Homura Akemi anymore? No, god damn it.</p>

            <p>In a similar note, I would have to name the Serena replacement featured in my upcoming mission, who brutally tortures and then murders Rini. But the worst part is that is the entire point of the Glaurunging bleepfic. It&#39;s torture porn written by someone who hates Rini to the point that they would write her getting brutally tortured and killed by her own mother! </p>

            <p>Revenge fics are indeed some of the worst ones. Why the heck would anyone think of doing that to a little girl is beyond me. Sure, Rini can be annoying sometimes, but that is absolutely no reason at all to do something this vile to her. Just as bad as is the &quot;motive&quot; they give Serena: Rini &quot;daring&quot; to love and show innocent affection towards her own father. For such &quot;crimes&quot; , Serena saws all ten of her fingers off and then rips her heart out. </p>
