            <p>I have a captain in Star Trek Online that I play more than any other captain. Over the years, I&#39;ve written a few short fics featuring the bridge crew of this captain. Given how... interesting some of them are, I figured maybe the crew and captain could become agents. They have basically no personality in game, for obvious reasons, so it wouldn&#39;t really count as having a canon character joining the PPC.<br><br>The crew are amusingly dysfunctional, I&#39;ve always thought of them as having a really crappy ship, and I&#39;ve had quite a while to develop them, so it could be fun. I&#39;m just not sure how to write the captain. I do have some options, I&#39;m just really bad at deciding which one to pick. I was thinking maybe a Vulcan raised in Ireland might be funny. We&#39;ve never seen one in canon, but that doesn&#39;t mean they don&#39;t exist, right?<br><br>I&#39;ve got hundreds of characters that I&#39;m not really planning on doing anything with, but very few of them are suitable for the PPC, so I&#39;m hoping I can make this bridge crew idea work.</p>

            <p>I have a Joined Trill Captain that I thought about using, but the way I envision him would not work well with my other agent ideas.<br><br>As far as the Captain alone, I do not see a problem, but the whole bridge crew?

            <p>I could just send a few of them on missions, which opens up the possibility of some stories taking place at HQ. And I actually made the Irish Vulcan, but she ended up the unfortunate victim of a tutorial glitch. My real captain was from an original work, and I was just planning on using the character creator to help me pin down their appearance, and it just... took off. I ended up playing them more than all my other captains combined, but she would NOT work well with the PPC. So, I figured an Irish Vulcan was a better choice.<br><br>I am curious, though, as to why you don&#39;t think your captain would work. A joined Trill could be a nice straight man to the insanity of badfic. Unless, of course, they are not a straight man.</p>

            <p>At the time I had planned on using an Imperial Intelligence Agent from Star Wars as one of my agents.  She was already designed as a no nonsense, career officer type.  The way I envisioned my Joined Trill Captain is still the same no nonsense career officer.  It just did not feel like there would be enough dynamic between the agents to get the feel right for the PPC.  But I think I am shelving that agent and working on another pair now, that would be very entertaining to write.<br><br>To that end I have my current prospects I am working on right now, a Pureblood Sith Warrior and a Soul Reaper (from Bleach).  I am working of fleshing those out now.  But they would have a very entertaining relationship, when they aren&#39;t actively trying to kill each other.</p>

            <p>Namely, I have a STO character called Cyba Zero who came after Agent!Cyba - although it was more that both of them came from an initial base idea that came before. Agent!Cyba and Captain!Cyba have since evolved away from one another. Visually their only common ground is a few Borg implants, now, and character-wise there is a certain disparity too. In fact, it would probably be a bad idea for Agent!Cyba to find out about or worse MEET Captain!Cyba - no IO I am NOT giving you ideas, even if it would be hilarious...</p>

            <p>That is mostly my familiarity with the canon.  I am familiar with a lot of Star Trek, but I am by no mean an expert.  I think I have only watched one or two episodes from TOS, non of the animated series, most of TNG, probably about 1/2 of Voyager, only a handful of episodes of DS9, and none of Enterprise.  I also have not watched most of the films.  So I am not comfortable enough writing a character from a Star Trek canon.</p>

            <p>Back in the day, you had your agent team: two agents who worked together. Sometimes they were written by two different Boarders (Jay and Acacia, Ekwy and Milano, Dafydd and Selene), sometimes both by the same person, but the concept stayed the same: any given writer had one team that they wrote missions for. They had side-characters, of course, but - to pluck an example from TOS - I don&#39;t think Jay and Acacia would ever have dreamt of writing Sean and Lux a mission.<br><br>Fast-forward to today: how many people <i>don&#39;t</i> have at least two teams they take on missions? I&#39;m not just talking about the newer writers, either - I have two active teams (well, one and a half), Nesh has two or more... it&#39;s virtually everyone.<br><br>So... why the change? What drove you, as a PPC writer, to want a second team - or even as a prospective PPC writer, since I know I&#39;ve seen people suggesting multiple teams right off the bat?<br><br>For myself, I&#39;ve done it twice: I added Narto and Lou to Dafydd and Selene, and then more recently I&#39;ve added Kaitlyn and Selene to Huinesoron. In the first instance, I did it because I wanted to do something fairly unique (for the time): first person missions. Dafydd was also winding down towards his retirement at that point.<br><br>The second time round, I brought Kaitlyn and Selene together with a very specific goal: short missions to post on FF.net. Huinesoron I already had a plan for, so I needed to cobble together a new team (out of old characters, even).<br><br>Obviously, my reasons don&#39;t apply to anyone else - so what <i>are</i> your reasons? I&#39;m curious.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Not just in terms of what stories I might spork, but also regarding character voice and how/what I write. I hadn&#39;t really written characters that were so out-and-out aggressive as Laura before; most were vaguely like pre-injury Danny, with his mellow snarkiness. Breaking up that original team and adding James (someone rich in combat experience, but poor in fictional lore) allows me to explore new themes and ideas.* Rachel was created out of a desire to write a more upbeat &quot;fan&quot;-ish character: one that could gush about a given topic without falling into sarcasm.<br><br>Gremlin is sort of an amalgam of Danny and Laura, but with the added benefit of allowing me as a writer to explore subjects I hadn&#39;t touched on before: superpowers, discrimination, LGBTQ themes, and so on. Xericka was meant to embody a more serious and analytical tone, as was Cornelius. Both Xericka and Cornelius also give me the opportunity to explore the nature of being and becoming human.<br><br>I must also admit that my second and third agent teams were created partially to explore aspects of the PPC I felt were being underused. Bad Slash was pretty much all but abandoned when I joined up. I always got a kick out of those missions (not to mention MSTs of slashfics on other sites), so I set out to make a agent group to carry that on. I feel like there is also a lot that can be done with alternate universes, which is why I set the stage for the DIAU crew.<br><br>*Provided I ever get enough time to write them down.</p>

            <p>I did ponder with the idea of makign a second team - in fact, Nikki was originally supposed to do only one mission with Sergio and Corolla and then get partnered with another agent. but in the end I decided to keep those three together.<br><br>The reason was that my original duo was rather unbalanced, with Sergio doing all phisical stuff due to Corolla being fairy-sized 90% of the time. With Nikki splitting the load things turned out to be better, so that&#39;s my reason to go with a trio despite it not being standard practice for the PPC. Besides, I would&#39;ve probably ended up putting my second team in Floaters anyways, so havign two teams was pretty redundant sporking-wise<br><br>After Blank Sprite I might make another team (it all depends on wheter I will do missions on my own or collaborations. Collaborations are tons of fun.), but with Sergio and Nikki retired and Corolla working mostly in DoSAT that would be pretty much the only way to write normal missions &quot;solo&quot;.</p>

            <p>I think I touched on this once before, but I believe all of what we call fiction to be true.  Authors (myself included) don&#39;t &quot;make things up&quot; but catch little subconscious cues about other worlds.  If the cues are strong enough, they&#39;re able to write a story about it.<br><br>So at the moment, I&#39;ve got my two main agents, and my Cafeteria pair, because they&#39;re the ones I&#39;ve seen most clearly.  I&#39;m starting to get stronger vibes from the Nursery lately, and am getting a picture of some of the kids there, so I&#39;m going to work that into my spin-off soonish down the road.  It just boils down to what I get a sense of happening over there.</p>

            <p>The urge to spork bad slash is very low, but in the event I want to, I&#39;ll bring in Arinellya and Kalen.

            <p>My earliest bios for Rashida and Falchion, back when they were referred to by their old names, had them in the DIC, but that restricted my choices of badfics for them to spork, so I put them in Floaters instead. However, I wanted to establish a DIC team even before I got Permission, and Sarah being ultimately assigned there instead of staying with Falchion seemed fitting because her homefic was a mega-crossover and she&#39;d be impacted enough to specialize in crossovers themselves. It also gave me a reason to bring in Cupid and Lapis as her partners, because three was already a crowd in RC #227 even before Ripper moved in.<br><br>As for Rayner and E.V.L., it seemed fitting that I&#39;d flesh out on the sole remaining agent from the team that Rashida had helped on, well, THAT mission (which will be discussed soon - not immediately, no, but SOON!), and also experiment with bringing one of my older OCs into the PPC as well (same with Lapis, but she isn&#39;t slated to be used in my own original fiction, yet, so she isn&#39;t as relevant here). I also wanted to experiment with an RC in which the agents were rivals and not allies, being forced to work together only because they had to. Speaking of which, I plan to get back to the two after my next two Floater&#39;s missions, which are already in progress.<br><br>So, tl;dr, my Floaters team served as a basis for the other teams, my DMS team was meant to test out some new things and flesh out some of my agents&#39; backstories, and my DIC team was set up so some of my recruited agents would have a place to stay without overcrowding the RCs that I&#39;d already set up at the time.<br><br>Oh, crap, guess I should warn you all beforehand... I may or may not be planning a FOURTH RC soon, but that one&#39;s going to be very minor compared to the previous three and I won&#39;t update it as often as I do with them. This is partly due to the fact that it&#39;s going to have a very niche role in the ecology of the PPC HQ - it&#39;s planned to be part of the DMS-VG (Video-Games) division.</p>

            <p>Nume and Ilraen are pretty versatile, but their interests only overlap with mine to a certain extent. They&#39;re particularly good for a certain set of fandoms and certain sorts of problems—medical nonsense, for one—but if I want to PPC something based on a musical or a video game, they don&#39;t work so well.<br><br>Also, even though in the beginning I wasn&#39;t too sure about the whole Sue-slaying thing, I kept managing to find Sues that ticked me off enough to want to do something about it, hence Nume and Ilraen&#39;s first two missions. I didn&#39;t want to keep making up excuses to shunt standard Sues to them in the DIC, so clearly I needed a DMS team, too.<br><br><i>Also</i> also, Gall fulfills my need to write a more modern, casual voice.

            <p>Personal anecdote time! (Warning: long. Also mostly rambling.)<br>Yeah, so my first game as DM was during the tail end of the D&amp;D5 playtest. And it was bad. Well, my friend had fun, but I think the others were just counting down until it was over.<br>The reasons for this, I feel, are twofold: one, I was basically playing the thing by ear. I had a basic outline of where I wanted to go, but I was spending half of each week planning scenario and encounters <i>and</i> worrying about making it fun for everyone <i>and</i> trying to give my friend what he wanted while also rewarding everyone else...<br>Oh, and the DMPC (who had been my PC in the previous game, and was thus sufficiently minmaxed to take on the entire adventure solo) probably didn&#39;t help matters.<br>The other reason was that I really had no idea how to build an adventuring day. I swear I seemed to think that if the characters weren&#39;t half-dead from the first encounter of the day, the encounters clearly weren&#39;t hard enough.<br>All of this could be avoided if you just use a pre-made adventure, of course.<br>My second adventure was much better: planned rigidly from the beginning, no real side-paths (just a single dungeon), better encounter pacing, only three good friends playing, a comprehensive set of rules to go with (as 5E had actually come out). Basically, it fixed everything that made my first try such a catastrophe. Plus I think the players were excited to be using 20th-level characters (yeah, don&#39;t try that. 20th-level characters are very difficult to constrain).<br>Since you&#39;re playing Pathfinder, you have a fair bit of system bloat to deal with - prestige classes got pretty ridiculous in D&amp;D3.5, and that carried over to Pathfinder. You may want to limit your players to just the core classes until you find your footing.<br>tl;dr it&#39;s not too hard, as long as you accept that you&#39;ll probably mess it up.</p>

            <p>Okay. Basically, there are the four basic classes, plus several other core classes (Barbarian, Druid, Ranger, Bard, Paladin, Sorcerer, Monk), which all use the basic 20-level progression.<br>D&amp;D3 (which Pathfinder is based on) had prestige classes, which you have to multiclass into. Prestige classes have a range of prerequisites, and allow for tighter focus in character building. Usually, they have a 10-level progression once you qualify for them, though they&#39;re not fixed.<br>Now, D&amp;D3.5 ended up with a massive amount of bloat - there were hundreds of prestige classes, and plenty of game-breaking ways to combine them. The <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/">Pathfinder SRD</a> has a few prestige classes, but it&#39;s probably best to ask your players to stick with single-class core classes until you get the hang of things.</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve played a couple of D&amp;D campaigns (AD&amp;D, 3.5e and 5e, specifically) and it seems to me that there are two parts to character creation: fluff and mechanics. Fluff depends on your creativity, mostly, so the time it takes changes from person to person. Crunch (mechanics), meanwhile, mainly depends on how familiar you are with the rule system.</p>

            <p>Check the official Pathfinder site.  They should have a few free scenarios you can download, mostly designed for Pathfinder Society organized play.  <br><br>First Steps Part 2 is a good introductory dungeon crawl.  It doesn&#39;t have a lot in terms of roleplay opportunities, though there are a few; however, combat is probably going to be what involves the most practice, for both you and your players.  The Silverhex Chronicles are good if you don&#39;t have a huge amount of time; each part should only take 1-2 hours, and you can play as many as you want in a sitting.  And We Be Goblins, though I haven&#39;t played it, looks like a lot of fun, though it isn&#39;t really designed to be worked into a long running campaign. <br><br>I don&#39;t have much in the way of general GM advice.  I&#39;ve done it a few times, and to be honest, I wasn&#39;t a huge fan.  The main thing I&#39;d say I want in a GM as a player is that I want the GM to ultimately be working with us, not against us.  Too many GMs see it as a competition between them and the players, and that can take a lot of fun out of it for me.</p>

            <p>While it&#39;s not exactly a normal resource, Pathfinder Society games are good if you&#39;re new to the system.  If there&#39;s a group in your area that runs it, you might want to check it out.  It&#39;s a good way to meet people and get some experience with the system.  There isn&#39;t as much of the world-building aspect, but that lets you focus on the other aspects of the game, which are what I struggle with personally.  Plus, it lets you meet a bunch of new people, which is always good.<br><br>Yeah, I think GMing combat can be especially tricky, because you have to familiarize yourself with all the monsters&#39; special abilities, as opposed to just your own character&#39;s.<br><br>For physical supplies, the main thing you&#39;re going to need is something with a grid on it.  I&#39;ve played a couple times without a grid, and it&#39;s a bit of a mess.  I&#39;d check out starter kits for a variety of gaming systems, and see what you can get a good deal on; I&#39;ve got one for 4e D&amp;D that&#39;s a pretty nice set with a big range of tokens.  But you can probably substitute graph paper if you can&#39;t find something like that.</p>

On Russia&#39;s side, its going to psychological horror, and maybe a bit of really dark comedy. <br><br>Do you think there&#39;s a way I could improve the &#39;grimdark&#39; aspect, or do you think it&#39;s a bit too tightly woven in?<br><br></p>

            <p>1) I would name it, at least in some throwaway dialog. <br><br>2) What?<br><br>3) Sounds ok, I guess. Considering the most I know about Hetalia is Italy, Germany, England, &#39;Murica, Japan, Canada, and what have you, I know nothing at all about Vietnam. I&#39;m not the best for horror advice though, because that&#39;s not really my thing.<br><br>4) Not really. It sort of goes along with psychological horror. Grimdark isn&#39;t neccicerrally bad, but it&#39;s a lot like slash. It&#39;s <i>really</i> easy to get wrong. Also, grimdark just for the sake of grimdark isn&#39;t a good thing. But you don&#39;t have that problem so we&#39;re all good.<br></p>

            <p>For those who don&#39;t already know, I&#39;m trying to write a realistic Tenth Walker story. At the moment, my OC is in Bree, learning the Common Tongue. She&#39;s be there for roughly a year, and then she&#39;ll be on her way to Rivendell, bearing her sick friend and accompanied by Halbarad the Ranger. But that&#39;s not important yet.<br><br>The thing is, I&#39;m having trouble balancing telling the story and not boring my audience to tears. Amy, as I said, is in Bree for a year, and almost nothing exciting happens. At the moment, my story is basically going &quot;This month came, here&#39;s the only two noteworthy things in it, and then there was this month, and other stuff happened.&quot; And I don&#39;t think that&#39;s good storytelling on my part. At the same time, I can&#39;t tell the story day by day, maybe not even week by week- it would a) take forever and b) be incredibly uninteresting. So.. any suggestions? </p>

            <p>If you have a short attention span, start with New <i>Who</i>. I was, eh, twelve when I started watching (Classic originally, but my dad suggested he swap to New after I got antsy), so it really just depends on how much action you want over (at least, at first) something more like edutainment. Of course, the Fourth Doctor&#39;s run is always worth watching. :)</p>

            <p><b>Activity:</b> I recognize your name and you&#39;ve been around a while, so you&#39;re good there. Gold star.<br><br><b>PPC Knowledge:</b> Seems solid. I noticed your mention of Bleepettes; for some reason that stuck out to me. You&#39;re good on this count.<br><br><b>Fic to Spork:</b> I almost missed the link, but I did spot it and dear Whedon what <i>is</i> that thing? Kill it and give it to the Reavers. (Don&#39;t listen to me, do what you will with it.)<br><br><b>Characters:</b> <s>I must say, I especially approve of Natasha&#39;s <i>Firefly</i> fandom</s> Look pretty good. Natasha seems to have a lot of potential set up by her backstory, and Aaron by his... new-ness? It&#39;ll leave him open for a lot of character growth. You&#39;re good to go here. ;) <br><br><b>Writing Ability (Creative):</b> Very good. I especially loved the CAD reading in the random prompt- *rubs neck* -bit of a Mood Whiplash at the end, but I think you pulled it off. (I laughed at the line about potato jokes in the control prompt, even though I don&#39;t get the reference, so that&#39;s a good sign.)<br><br><b>Writing Ability (Technical):</b> I did notice one typo (&quot;<i>A thin line of Glitterly blood oozed from the wound.</i>&quot;) but other than that, you&#39;re golden.<br><br>It is therefore my pleasure to say <b>Permission Granted!</b> Happy sporking!</p>

            <p>I can even give You my most recent example:<br><br>I am currently working on my little <i>Harry Potter</i> Next Generation project. I was looking for some new characters to introduce; I had some ideas, but they needed one final polishing. Meanwhile, I was listening to some Yiddish music because, let&#39;s be honest, I work best while listening to old/weird/foreign music.<br><br>I found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpVfexwTZM4">these ladies</a>. Now, a bit of explanation about the origin of this video:<br>This comes from a Polish television TVP1. It&#39;s from 2008&#39;s benefit concert of a famous theatre actor, strongly involved with Warsaw&#39;s Jewish Theatre.<br><br>If you look at the first lady - Mrs Golda Tencer (who is, by the way, currently the widow after the guy whom this concert was for) - you&#39;ll see where I got my inspiration from. The clothes she&#39;s wearing, the hair style, the voice and the... <i>ekhm</i> figure... It all resembles what I see as a stereotypical witch character. Maybe even a little bit of what I want <i>Discworld</i>&#39;s Nanny Ogg to be.<br><br>And so, Mrs Golda, plus a character of <a href="http://anime.astronerdboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/UQH-CH76-PG15.jpg">Dana</a> from the manga <i>UQ Holder!</i> helped me create my Next Generation DADA professor :D<br><br>  </p>

            <p>I quite enjoyed this story. There were some very good character moments. The introduction with Su getting into Internet arguments over (what I assume is) Greek culture was particularly entertaining. The two new characters did feel a bit flat, but I attributed that to this being their first appearance/mission.<br><br>I will admit to having a few complaints. While the breaking out into song was a great touch, I wasn&#39;t too fond of some of the other fourth-wall-nudging bits: Su&#39;s use of italics and the reference to the wiki, to be precise (unless there is some sort of in-universe PPC Wiki, which I could see happening. I could also see such a thing being almost constantly locked from outside edits). I also didn&#39;t much care for the little excursion into Gen 1. It felt a bit too randomly wacky, especially since it played no impact on the plot whatsoever.<br><br>All in all, very nice work. Definite kudos from me.</p>

            <p>Though I would have thought that the mission would be a bit more … <i>substantial</i> given how notorious it seems to be within the brony fandom (and given that the legendary Tawaki himself came out of hiding to spork it!), I must say that this is nonetheless a good mission. And a fitting end for Not!Cheerilee.<br><br>Allow me to add to the chorus saying that the &quot;This Day&quot; rendition was a good touch, however, if Herr Wozzeck were here, he might point out that the lines don&#39;t exactly scan.<br><br>As for errors, I haven&#39;t caught any—at least, not in the  <i>English</i>. There is, however, an error in the Greek. Granted, my experience is in Ancient Greek, not modern, but even still, that was enough to tell me that something was amiss. Apparently Google Translate is just as bad at modern Greek as it is in Latin.<br><br>Either way, given Suicide&#39;s background, he should be speaking in ancient Greek, not mangled modern Greek. &quot;Love&quot; is easy to translate, but as I cannot find a word for &quot;tolerate&quot;; I chose a word for &quot;be patient&quot; instead:<br><br>&quot;Love and be patient&quot;--&gt;&quot;αγάπα καὶ καρτέρει&quot;--&gt;&quot;agápa kaì kartérei&quot;<br><br>That aside, good mission!<br><br>P.S.: After poking around a bit on Wikipedia, I might have figured out exactly what went wrong on Google Translate&#39;s end of things. <br>What you <i>wanted</i> were a couple of imperatives. If my (admittedly sloppy) research is not mistaken, what came out were two third-person plural verbs, one in the present active indicative, and one in the present mediopassive indicative: &quot;they love and they tolerate/they are tolerated/they tolerate each other&quot;<br><br></p>

            <p>I thought the italics lampshading would be my favorite part, until I read the song that the agents broke out into near the climax.

            <p>In light of a little thing that happened in the PPC Agent Mailbox Game, I thought it would be a fun idea to explore the happenings at the Department of Fictional Psychology. So on that note, I present to you a fun little informal RP thread: &quot;Shenanigans At FicPsych!&quot;<br><br>With that in mind, let&#39;s set up some ground rules:<br><br>1.) NO MAJOR EVENTS ARE ALLOWED IN THIS RP. No surprise Sues, no giant microbes, no nothing. If you want your agents to have fun and goof off at FicPsych, go on ahead! But don&#39;t do anything violent or otherwise distracting for other characters.<br><br>2.) You do not need permission to be involved in this thread. However, it is desirable that you have a character who works in FicPsych like I do. If you don&#39;t, you can always send in one of your characters to talk with another FicPsych worker.<br><br>3.) Be respectful of other PPCers. Do I have to explain this one? Your characters can be demeaning as long as it&#39;s in character, but please don&#39;t make OOC drama.<br><br>4.) If you have Permission, feel free to use any threads you have contributed to for interludes and such. Just remember to talk to the people you roleplayed with, or work together on such content if you can.<br><br>5.) And last, but not least, have fun!</p>

            <p>(I know several other Boarders, including myself, who have characters who work at FicPsych. This isn&#39;t a strict requirement, however - as a starting scenario you could have one or more of your agents walk into FicPsych and wait for someone to take care of them. Those of us who have FicPsych employees can then interact with these agents, which is also an opportunity to get to know Boarders that you haven&#39;t done much with up to this point.<br><br>I&#39;m also tempted to explore what happens to canons that get taken to FicPsych in the wake of missions in this RP thread, but that could open up such a massive can of worms that I&#39;d rather not risk it.)</p>

            <p>Like I said, don&#39;t mind me, I&#39;m just old and crotchety. I actually found myself pretty interested in Nurse Chan&#39;s backstory, and the idea of her being drawn to the PPC and FicPsych because she heard about Jenni (although I don&#39;t quite know how she could have; Jenni doesn&#39;t really go around advertising her history that much). Powers know Jenni wouldn&#39;t mind having someone around who could relate to her on that level.<br><br>But, what with all the woe and angst, I support scaling her down a bit, too. {= )<br><br>Actually, the person Nurse Chan is really going to have to contend with is Suzine. I can&#39;t see her being overly thrilled with the notion of Pokémon in her department, especially ones that purport to be <i>members</i> of the department but refuse to communicate properly. (Immac will love them, though!)<br><br>Also, Suzine, Dr. Freedenberg, and the Kudzu want to know when they got a Paidopsychiatry Division, and doesn&#39;t the Nursery handle all that? I mean, sure, there&#39;s the odd canon character who&#39;s a child, but the nurses can deal with them without needing a whole division set aside for it. It&#39;s not at all a bad idea to have someone who specializes in the needs of younger people, but calling one person and a couple critters a division is a little silly, IMO, and the nurses each have their style/specialty without divisions anyway.<br><br>Oh, BTW, I just caught up on the bit with Shui-Hua (hope I got that right) having an appointment with Jenni. We could totally RP that here if you want. I&#39;m all caught up with AtLA:LoK, so I (and Jenni) get what her deal is. You&#39;ll just have to excuse me if I take a long time between posts, is all.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>And to the crunchy part! Well rather than drawn, she was actually <i>thrown</i> into the PPC. And the &quot;two years here&quot; part, has an explanation. Is a reference to about how much time ago I last did anything related to her (September, 2012), so what happened to her? She was exiled to the PPC of course! <br><br>Anyhow, now that I removed the Time Lord part from her (And exorcised Cookie Chan, my actual Jenni Robinson analog), I removed 4 lifetimes worth of woes and angst, but I also removed anything she had in common with Nurse Jenni. She could still be her assistant during those two lost years though, and we could say that she just got her flashpatch and Solvig is the first patient that treats by herself.<br><br>She would have to contend with that and more... The Pokémon AU she comes from is from 160 years in the past and has WWII era technology, standard Poké Balls might as well be sorcery for her. And yes, there&#39;s her Pikachu suddenly deciding to be obstinate, but there´s something else: The fact that her Gardevoir is a trained <i>War Pokémon</i>. And there are other number of stuff that should be addressed in her backstory, to explain why she is what she is today, and to give closure to her original story.<br><br>Well, I can remove the &quot;Division&quot; part and call her a &quot;Paidopsychiatry Specialist&quot;, in other words, she would specialize in minors under 16 years old. And the critters? Her therapy style is &quot;Animal-assisted therapy&quot;.<br><br>Of course! It would be great! (I pretty much chose Nurse Jenni there because she&#39;s the one specialized in PPC Agents. =P)</p>

            <p>I was waiting for Edhelistar to kick of the RP, actually, and came here to say so once I realized I hadn&#39;t.

Wikimon and Digimon Wikia, have some problems with incomplete information regarding <i>Digimon Savers</i>. Apparently that series wasn&#39;t that popular in English speaking countries.

And I&#39;m not even taking into account the continuity snarl that the Digimon franchise itself is (Five different continuities! And that&#39;s just taking into account the Animated Series!).</p>

            <p>This is a pretty good mission. Just like with your <i>Five Nights</i> collab mission, you did well in ensuring that someone who does <i>not</i> know the canon (e.g., yours truly) can follow the mission and understand what went wrong. And I&#39;m getting intrigued as to what&#39;s going to happen to Rashida.<br><br>Of course, there are a few errors in the mission:<br><br><i>“So, Suta was part of Gonza’s pack?” asked Rashida, ducking just as Falchion buzzed her.<br>“Wait, who’s pack?” the giant pterosaur asked,</i><br>That should read, &quot;<b>whose</b> pack&quot;.<br><br><i>“According to the words, its supposed to be Heart who <b>blushed faintly and picked up his sleeping son in his arms</b>, and not Umasou,” said Ripper.</i><br>&quot;words&quot; should be capitalized.<br><br>And regarding the Word Cyclone: Word Cyclones occur when there are run-on sentences, not when there is a lack of paragraph breaks. You might want to do something else with that scene, especially since that Cyclone is only used to lead to the mission.</p>

            <p>The Rose Potter sporkings were originally posted on Journalfen, which is in the middle of transferring from Livejournal code to Dreamwidth, I think.  So anything that was on Journalfen (HMS STFU, Fandom Wank, Bad Penny, etc.) is unavailable at the moment.<br><br>Unfortunately, Mervin mentioned on Das Sporking that she&#39;s pretty busy at the moment, but you could always try contacting her.  Right now, I think everyone&#39;s waiting to see what&#39;s going to happen with JF; they might eventually reload all the old entries, but there&#39;s no guarantee that it&#39;ll be any time soon.</p>

            <p>Hello, everyone! I&#39;m GlarnBoudin, a guy who&#39;s... I don&#39;t know, pissed off at the poor quality of a lot of fan fiction, I guess. I&#39;m a big fan of the Godzilla franchise, and kaiju in general. I also like Pokemon, but I prefer to stay with fan made ones: in fact, it was SkarmorySilver&#39;s writings that actually introduced me to the PPC in the first place! Anyway, I also like Jurassic Park, Fossil Fighters-chances are, if it has dinosaurs in it, I&#39;ve probably heard of it. I also like My Little Pony, the Resident Evil series to a degree (never played the games, but I know most of the creatures), the Alien franchise, and a crapload of others.<br><br>I haven&#39;t read too much of the PPC stories-I&#39;m just starting the original series-but I really like SkarmorySilver&#39;s agents, as well as Voyd&#39;s, Jay, and Acacia: I can relate to liking creepy monsters!<br><br>My first agent is a character from a discarded fan fiction concept I had. It... wasn&#39;t pretty-basically, a Gary Stu Author Avatar was transformed from a kaiju into a pony, and would eventually end up transforming the Mane 6 into kaiju as well. There were quite a few other kaiju that I thought up, but the only one that I had envisioned in my head was Carnage, the main character.<br><br>Carnage has now been EXTREMELY tuned down, but I do need someone, maybe SkarmorySilver, as he&#39;s got experience with dragons and kaiju, to come up with a drawing of him: I absolutely suck at drawing. I do have a few rough sketches for his head-the main part that distinguishes him from other creatures like him-but otherwise, that&#39;s all I&#39;ve got.<br>Here&#39;s the link to Carnage&#39;s bio (Still very much a WIP): <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Kz1SFNZHiKhvcT3VyIiQTeC0rySxexbxCrSi-W8Wj4Y"><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Kz1SFNZHiKhvcT3VyIiQTeC0rySxexbxCrSi-W8Wj4Y">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Kz1SFNZHiKhvcT3VyIiQTeC0rySxexbxCrSi-W8Wj4Y</a></a><br>I&#39;m also probably going to be finding A LOT of badfic for you guys, so if you suddenly see a crapload of unclaimed badfic appearing at once, it&#39;s probably going to be me.<br>Thanks for taking the time to read this, and I hope to get along with all of you guys, gals, and those who fit neither category!</p>

            <p>Always nice to see people finding the PPC because they&#39;re already writers and fanfic-readers. {= )<br><br>In addition to the note about getting Permission before you write PPC stories, I&#39;d also like to caution you that, while finding and reporting badfic is an essential PPC past-time, there&#39;s not much sense in reporting, as you say, A LOT of badfic. Not all of it makes for good missions, and if it&#39;s in a fandom that only a couple of people are interested in, chances are pretty slim that it&#39;s going to be taken anyway. Not all badfic interests all PPCers equally.<br><br>So, kindly don&#39;t flood the Board or the wiki with a gazillion fics that only two or three people might care about. Also, when you DO report badfics to the Board, make sure to use whatever badfic thread is currently on the first page of posts to avoid knocking other topics off. Thanks! {= D<br><br>See also: <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/FAQ:_For_Newbies">FAQ: For Newbies</a>, <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/FAQ:_The_Board">FAQ: The Board</a>, and the <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Guide_to_the_PPC">Guide to the PPC</a>.<br><br>Oh, and your gift.

            <p>Uh, so I&#39;ve been a huge fan of the PPC for almost two years now, and have been too scared to post anything here. <br>Hi, I&#39;m Lemurnoises and I&#39;m in so many fandoms that it hurts. Mostly Les Mis, Tolkien, Star Trek, Sherlock, Firefly, and *pointedly refuses eye contact* TF2.<br>Trojie and Pads were some of the first stories I&#39;ve read, and I have no other words to describe them then utterly awesome. I&#39;ve read the Bagenders (which my phone keeps trying to put in all caps) an unholy amount of times.<br> Badfic has always bothered me, and when I found the PPC I swear it was like in movies. when a choir plays in the background, and light shines from the sky, and doves magically appear for asthetic purposes. <br>This is a really bland introduction thingy and I&#39;m really sorry &#39;bout that, I promise I&#39;m not boring, really. </p>

            <p>Also, there&#39;s nothing wrong with being a TF2 fan. It&#39;s a great game with an astounding sense of humor.

Then the bluenette dusts her with her hands*<br><br>((Hey! Stop groping her!))<br><br>*sticks her tongue out to the ceiling* You are no fun. Now, what else I had to do? Oh yes! *grabs Emiran&#39;s head...* This. *...and kisses him on the lips* Bye, bye! *opens a plothole and jumps in it before the Guardsman can react*<br><br>((Hey, someone give that girl an Anti-Lustin shot!))<br><br>*from inside the plothole* Ha ha.

He whirled around, pointing his machine pistol at all suspicious-looking corners in the hallway. &quot;Damn. Got away.&quot; He wiped his mouth again. The Gallifreyan man prayed that the kiss wasn&#39;t laced with Glitter. He had no desire to contract some weird Suvian disease from some stupid slip up. Either way, the self-proclaimed Rune Knight messed up big time: he had her biometric data now. There was no way she could come crawling back into HQ without tripping every single bio-alarm... The Time Lord holstered his staser and began scanning the tissue with his Laser Screwdriver. Backups were always good.<br><br>Just then, the FicPsych nurse bolted upright. &quot;Uggh...

Wait, that sounded better in my head. Ignore that, please. Bottom line: I&#39;m not here to finish you off or anything. How are you feeling? Not too beaten up, I hope?&quot;<br><br></p>

Her known forms so far are:<br><br>- Rune-Midgarts: Lord Knight (RO) / Warrior (RO2)<br>- Star Wars: Jedi Sentinel<br>- Pokémon: Aura Guardian<br>- DC Universe: Gadgeteer Superhero<br>- Marvel Universe: Agent of SHIELD<br>- Middle-earth: Rohirrim Guardian<br>- The Elder Scrolls: Nord Dragonborn<br>- PPC HQ: Unstable, she might be able to use the abilities of all above, or some that she shouldn&#39;t even be able to.<br><br>In all her forms she always is Lawful Good, with a deviation to Neutral Good.<br><br>Anyhow, my plan to use her is mostly as a part of the supporting cast, for canon knowledge (I don&#39;t  have Ragnarök or Elder Scrolls canon specialists planned) and combat support, after all, she has a Knight mindset, protect the weak and those who cannot defend themselves, so when the Plot Continuum is the one that needs protection, expect her to take arms to protect it, even if she gets her ass kicked over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over... <i>ad infinitum</i>. What? Being inmortal is not as good as it seems, and she&#39;s not as awesome as she looks like, for example, if she tries to go against Darth Vader in her Jedi form, she will get her butt handed to over her, <i><a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">badly</a></i>. So, she&#39;ll be, more or less, like a non-psychopathic female version of Deadpool, that appears when needed.<br><br>So, what do you think of this idea?))</p>

            <p>So, if you know me, you probably know that I love designing the hell out of new characters, and once I get going, it&#39;s impossible to stop the ideas until they&#39;re in a mostly-complete form.<br><br>So, my main question: What is the absolute upper limit of power that you guys think a PPC agent should have?<br><br>For me, Chakkik and Kala were as powerful as I dared. Chakkik has access to natural magic that increases in potency the more he uses it. Kala is larger, stronger, and faster than a human being, she has paralytic scorpion venom, and is overall not someone you want to mess with. Even with them, they&#39;re mostly restrained by disguises. Chakkik gets cut off from his magic, and Kala loses some (but not all) of her strength.</p>

            <p>Acceptable agent power level = (experience * humor / target department) - bad idea quotient.<br><br>... Does that make sense? I think that almost makes sense.<br><br>Ahem. Anyway. Theoretically, there is no upper limit. I think the most powerful agents I know about are basically demigods. It&#39;s entirely possible.<br><br>BUT.<br><br>BUT. The thing is, there&#39;s not generally much point to it. So you have a character who can destroy his enemies with a glance or rewrite reality with a stray thought. So what? An action agent still has to go on missions, wear a disguise, watch the fic, write charges, and carry out the Duty like everyone else. An infrastructure agent is basically a 9-5 working joe; not much call for phenomenal cosmic power there.<br><br>The only reason to bother with a high-powered character is if it has some bearing on their characterization that will make them more interesting to read about. If it adds humor, so much the better.<br><br>One example, of course, is my Jenni. She&#39;s basically a demigod. She takes physical form because she feels like it and has a whole host of powers, including the aforementioned ability to rewrite reality, because she has access to the source code.<br><br>But she doesn&#39;t. She knows better—but she didn&#39;t used to. Her backstory, both meta and in-universe, is all about learning that throwing power around willy-nilly to solve your problems isn&#39;t a good idea, and can actually really annoy people. Plus, if you do that to other people, you&#39;re taking something away from them, and that&#39;s wrong. And at some point she also realized she doesn&#39;t have infinite power, so the more she uses, the more she tires out. So, despite having a very high power level, she also has great limitations. The only real legacy of her power is the lessons she&#39;s learned from the mistakes she made with it in the past.<br><br>Not that she doesn&#39;t give in to temptation every now and then, in which case she has Nume to scold her and the Flowers to slap a humiliating Sue-tracker on her. Fun times.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Like I said, Chakkik and Kala are as powerful as I dare. I don&#39;t know how to make interesting characters at any level higher than that.

            <p>Of course, there&#39;s a time and place for everything, just like humor. I mean, it&#39;s very, very hard to joke about a rape scene in a badfic, for example.<br><br>As awesome as the humor aspect of the PPC is, we gotta remember it&#39;s also a rather serious setting, what with agents going insane and the threat of being killed by Sues and all.

            <p>I know that some of my missions (*cough*&quot;All Through With This Niceness and Negotiation Stuff&quot;*cough*) and interludes ([SPOILER REDACTED]) have more drama than funsies; I also think it&#39;s unavoidable. In a setting where the protagonists (so to speak) regularly see mind-bending things and regularly go insane, there is bound to be drama. The trick is, of course, not to go all &#39;hurp durp WE&#39;RE GRIMDERP in the future there is only darkness&#39; mode and remember that the PPC is ultimately there to take something bad (badfic) and turn it into something good (missions); excessive drama is not good.</p>

            <p>A Sayan and a Kriptonian, for example. Then, set them in a department like Bad Slash.

            <p>When I made Wtak and Smithers, I didn&#39;t give them innate abilities, but rather the capability to learn and/or master new skills fairly quickly- Wtak was constantly experimenting with different types of magic and Smithers with technology, and Smithers additionally often <i>gained</i> abilities from his disguises.<br><br>That way, their capabilities could adjust dynamically to the rough power level of the continuum and Sue they were hunting at any given time.

            <p>Hi!<br><br>So, I had another question with my Tenth Walker.You mentioned Galadriel reading her mind- how should I handle that?<br><br>My current idea is that Amy only knows three things about the plot. Gandalf dies, Boromir dies, and the Ring is destroyed. That&#39;s it. But if Galadriel reads her mind, she&#39;ll see how they&#39;re connected- Gandalf dies, Boromir dies, and THEN the Ring is destroyed. Won&#39;t she realize that, since Amy has messed up one of those already, the Ring may not be thrown in Mount Doom at all?  </p>

            <p><i>&quot;Remember that the Mirror shows many things, and not all have yet come to pass. Some never come to be, unless those that behold the visions turn aside from their path to prevent them. The Mirror is a dangerous guide of deeds.&quot;</i><br><br>This is also a good statement about prophecies in Arda in general. Not only are they often able to be read two wildly-different ways - take the naming of Arvedui &#39;Last-King&#39; of Arthedain, who would be the Last King of Arthedain <i>either</i> because he would claim Gondor and rule over a Reunited Kingdom... or because his realm would fall utterly - but are also very much of the &#39;if you try to prevent it, that may be the cause of it&#39; variety.<br><br>There&#39;s also the nature of <i>tercen</i>, elven &#39;Insight&#39; (which is what Galadriel has). It&#39;s not so much mind-reading as... oh, heart-reading? I mean, she didn&#39;t look at Boromir and go &#39;hey, mate, I can see you want the Ring; I think it&#39;s time you went a different way&#39;. She&#39;d probably pick up on Amy&#39;s relief that she&#39;s rescued Gandalf, her worry that she <i>won&#39;t</i> be able to save Boromir, and her confidence that the Ring will be destroyed. Maybe also her probably-ambiguous-at-this-point feelings about being in a book.<br><br>I think Galadriel will use prophecy as her frame of reference. She&#39;ll see the things that Amy knows happen as prophecies: one has been proven false (or at least seems to have been); the others are yet to come. Perhaps they&#39;ll never happen. Perhaps they&#39;re pretty much fixed. Perhaps Amy could meddle with them. Who knows the will of Iluvatar?<br><br>One thing I think she <i>wouldn&#39;t</i> do is show Amy the Mirror. She can&#39;t be trusted! She had a prophecy, and she actively worked to negate it. That&#39;s precisely what Galadriel warns Frodo against. But that doesn&#39;t mean Galadriel won&#39;t use her own <i>apacen</i> (Foresight, which is heavily implied to be what &#39;powers&#39; the Mirror in the first place) to peek ahead... and maybe drop a couple of hints. She may <i>want</i> to keep from meddling, but she <i>is</i> a Noldo; <s>we</s> they have difficulty with restraint. ;)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I can&#39;t say that I really enjoyed this one. It felt a bit lackluster, which I would attribute in large part to its MST-like structure. There&#39;s barely any action: the vast majority of the fic is &quot;badfic snippet -- snarky agents -- badfic snippet -- snarky agents&quot; and so on. <br><br>I also have to present my qualms with the &quot;Shades of Rose&quot; concept. I don&#39;t mind the idea of Sues and Stus having some sort of collective knowledge of the PPC, but implementing it as some sort of spiritual memory shared between similarly named characters feels like it could be both a bit constricting and uncreative. And just saying &quot;not all Roses are Shades&quot; in an effort to make it seem otherwise feels like a copout. Like Desdendelle said, I would argue against bringing back Rose Potter in almost any sort of form. Her story is done.</p>

            <p>So. I mentioned that not all Shades of Rose are Sues, or even bad characters, because they get picked up by good authors.<br><br>You know what I&#39;d be interested in seeing? An agent that is, or used to be, a Shade. I probably wouldn&#39;t be the one to write this character, though, for a few reasons.<br><br>First, all of my characters (except <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Publica_Kurusu">one</a>) are actually from the continuum in question; they could conceivably exist in canon. I&#39;m not sure how I&#39;d write an Action-department badfic recruit.<br><br>Second, there&#39;d probably have to be an element of forgiveness. A well-written Shade probably regrets the actions of Rose Potter, and desperately wants to atone, ESPECIALLY if they learn about what happened to Rina. After all, a non-evil Shade could relate to her trauma. They remember the deaths of Rose. What WOULD Rina do if she met a Shade that truly wanted to atone for the actions of her Mother?<br><br>While I personally think Ix would be the best person to write this character, because of Rina&#39;s more personal connection to Rose Potter, anybody who thinks they&#39;ve got the skill could pick up this idea. Just... not me, alright? That&#39;s a lot more drama and emotion than I feel like I can pull off. RC 211 missions 5 and 7 were probably my upper limit for drama.</p>

            <p>When Rina read the print-out of Gabby and Chakik&#39;s mission report, the paper slipped from her fingers, falling to the floor as she just stared blankly ahead, starting to shake.<br><br>&quot;Rina?&quot; Zeb asked, coming over to see what was going on. &quot;You don&#39;t look so good...&quot;<br><br>&quot;She&#39;s not dead,&quot; Rina whimpered. &quot;All that work for nothing.

I... I wouldn&#39;t be here if it weren&#39;t for you, after all.&quot;<br><br>Underneath his fur, Zeb blushed. &quot;Oh, well...&quot;<br><br>&quot;We both know it, don&#39;t be so modest.&quot; Rina ruffled Zeb&#39;s mane. &quot;I don&#39;t know what I&#39;d do without you,&quot; she said.<br><br>&quot;Probably snap and run away,&quot; Zeb said, laughing.<br><br>Rina&#39;s eyes took on a distant look. &quot;Probably,&quot; she murmured.<br><br>- - -<br><br>Well, that suddenly got dark. But yes, if anyone was the real hero of the Rose Potter missions, it would be Zeb. Just wanted to set the record straight.</p>

            <p>When I saw the concept, I thought it was a <i>different</i> <a href="http://das-sporking.livejournal.com/922155.html">incestuous Rose Potter</a>.  Though that one involves dimension-hopping instead of actual siblings.<br><br>Like Desdendelle, I have mixed feelings on the &quot;Shades of Rose&quot; concept.  It&#39;s very creative, don&#39;t get me wrong, but it feels kind of limiting.  I&#39;m especially not sure about the idea of them sharing some of <i>the</i> Rose&#39;s abilities; Sues don&#39;t need an excuse to be even more Speshul than they already are.  Plus, I can see it being used as an excuse to &quot;power up&quot; an otherwise unremarkable Sue just to make the agents defeating her seem more badass.  On the other hand, comparisons to <i>the</i> Rose are pretty much inevitable with any other Rose Potters, and I really, really like the idea of that having some kind of metatextual weight.  And the joke about her not being able to get pregnant was hilarious.  So I feel like it works well for an optional one-off, but I&#39;d hesitate to make it standard for all Rose Potters.</p>

            <p>How about this? You guys are free to use the Shades of Rose concept <i>as you see fit</i>. Like Tira said, it&#39;s not needed for all Sues by that name... but for some, it could work.<br><br>If you don&#39;t feel like whatever Rose you&#39;re up against deserves(?) to be a remnant, then she doesn&#39;t have to be. If you feel that a Shade of Rose would improve your mission, go for it! Just remember that the Shades are <i>terrified</i> of the PPC, especially the DMS and even more especially Rina and Zeb.</p>

            <p>First of all, the mission&#39;s a bit on the short side - I feel like there&#39;s something missing. Second, capitalisation minis are frowned upon. Third, I&#39;m not sure how I feel about the Shades of Rose idea - on one hand, that&#39;s an intertextual thing, which is good; on the other hand, it&#39;s something that forces itself upon all of the other writes who might want to mission a Sue called Rose Potter.<br><br>Oh, also?

            <p>So, Iximaz, Sergio and Turbo and I have almost finished our co-write, and we need betas. Aside from the usual SPaG/flow/whatnot checking, a strong stomach is needed, as the fic condones rape, is full of disgusting violence and is generally squick-y. It&#39;s <i>Harry Potter</i>, but I think we&#39;re covered, canon-wise. Interested parties should list their e-mails so we&#39;ll be able to share the GDoc with them.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m going to go ahead and say it upfront, you look good in everything but one area: Writing Ability (Creative). Take a look at this passage:<br><br><i>Nine was left to clean up his partner’s mess. AGAIN. And that Witness lady’s mess… “Oh, crap. Things are on fire. Why do these things always happen to me?” he said, to nobody in particular. He picked up the fire extinguisher, and used it. Unfortunately, he had it facing the wrong way. “No, that is not the right direction,” he said, as he turned it the other way around. He put out the fire. “There we go.”</i><br><br>The prose is... well, beige at best. We don&#39;t get any description, and it feels like you&#39;re trying to force the humor. What&#39;s your agent thinking? Why doesn&#39;t he react to (supposedly) getting covered in foam? There&#39;s just... No life to your stories. <br><br>Try being a bit more descriptive with what your characters are doing, and get inside their heads. Show, don&#39;t tell, you know? <br><br>Try cleaning up your writing and come back, but for now, I&#39;m going to have to say <b>Permission Denied</b>.</p>

            <p><a href="http://bonsaimallorn.webs.com/Snowfight2005Part1.htm">The PPC Snowfight</a> (2005) has obviously been up on my website for a long time. What you may not be aware of is that the dialogue is taken word-for-word from the RP in question. So are the actions, though the roleplaying style of the time was to describe them, not put them in narrative. Eg:<br><br><i>[Wanders across the Board; hears a whistling sound; ducks and covers] Ayt! [Runs from incoming snowballs] To me, o my kinsfolk!<br><br>[Hides behind a snowdrift; grabs a shovel and starts digging Snow!Nargothrond]<br><br>And </i>this<i> time, we&#39;re not going to be tricked into building a stupid bridge.</i><br><br>(That&#39;s reconstructed, obviously - the original posts are loooong gone!)<br><br>So if you want to see how ordinary PPCers acted back in the heady days of &#39;05... look no further.<br><br>hS<br><br>(PS: I still find the idea of taking a titles-only thread from the <a href="http://huinesoron.webs.com/PPC/BoardArchive.htm">Board Archives</a> and trying to roleplay-reconstruct the contents hilarious.)</p>

An author of sorts named Lee Goldberg (he wrote episodes of <i>Monk</i>, I think, and some not-terribly-good books) decided that fanfiction writers were the devil, and posted about it on his blog. Want to guess how that ended?<br><br>Well, you don&#39;t have to!

And her idea of what should happen in the story miiiiight not quite be what the PPC wants. Plus, she kills noncanonical characters without warning, not even charging them. She crosses one, they get an axe in the neck.<br><br>As for how she travels... well, she knows how to manipulate plotholes just well enough to move between continua.<br><br>How does she kill Sues? The same way we do. Her weapon of choice, as stated, is a fire axe, but considering how out-there she is, she may or may not actually <i>need</i> it.<br><br>And as I said, Helen is an <i>antagonist</i>, not a PPC agent.

            <p>But she does seem like a Sue to be honest.  Maybe not from an in-universe standpoint, but from an out-of-universe standpoint.  It&#39;s kind of sounding like a bad creepypasta with an unstoppable super-creepy killer.

            <p>A few comments:<br><br>-Do we really need huge blocks of the badfic quoted in there? Parts of this verge on MSTing, which is a wonderful art, but not what PPC missions are about.<br><br>-Your agents have a nasty habit of not speaking like people (of any species). A random example:<br><br><i>“Voldemort never once transformed into an animal,” he said angrily. “The whole deal about the snake he has on him is because he has a pet snake. And as for proper Animagi, it takes at least a month to prepare for such a transformation! You can’t just get magical powers and a new form in an instant!”</i><br><br>That&#39;s an infodump right there. And your mission is fairly liberally littered with them. You <i>don&#39;t</i> have to demonstrate that you know every little thing that&#39;s wrong with the story, y&#39;know. And... people don&#39;t <i>talk</i> like that.<br><br>-Talking heads. No, your agents aren&#39;t quite literally talking heads - but they really don&#39;t feel like they&#39;re in the same room as the characters. Go check out a Jay and Acacia mission or two - they spend all their time hiding behind things, straining to hear, etc etc. Your agents are facing <i>basilisks</i>, but seem to be wandering around in the open.<br><br>-And... you know how there are some missions you want to reread, because you love the way the agents interact? This just... doesn&#39;t do that. Other than canon knowledge, I didn&#39;t see anything to really distinguish the agents from <i>each other</i>, let alone from other agents. They were just... two snarky infodumpers hanging around in plain sight.<br><br>That&#39;s the criticism, I guess. Here&#39;s the constructive:<br><br>-Go write out what defines your agents. Pick out the things that make them <i>different</i> from each other. Work out ways to integrate those into your missions.<br><br>-Give yourself a tight limit for badfic line-usage. One sentence per page? Ten sentences total? It&#39;s up to you, but it would be a serious improvement. I&#39;m here to read <i>your</i> writing, not some which you&#39;ve acknowledged is bad.<br><br>-Assume that everyone will notice your agents if they get in their line of sight or make a loud noise. Figure out where your team needs to hide. Give the canons and badfic characters reactions when your agents inevitable start yelling. Dumbledore isn&#39;t going to ignore someone ranting in the corner of his office!<br><br>Okay, that&#39;s enough of that. I think your agents are excellent in concept (though I do have a weakness for maniraptorans, so y&#39;know); I think there&#39;s a lot you could explore with them. I also think it&#39;s great that you&#39;re actually <i>writing missions</i>, which is more than I can say for most people (eg, me!). But I also think that your missions could be much tighter, cleaner, and more engaging.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>As long as a fictional world adheres to its own rules, you can believe that carpets can fly and dragons are real, for instance. When those internal rules are broken, so is the suspension of disbelief. For example, if it&#39;s established magic can&#39;t bring the dead back to life, then the characters shouldn&#39;t break this rule. If they do, you get canon Sues and Stus as well as plotholes.</p>

            <p>Roosters really were executed due to supposedly laying eggs back in the day for precisely this reason. According to Wikipedia, &quot;The Venerable Bede was the first to attest to the legend of the birth of a basilisk from an egg by an old cockerel, and then other authors added the condition of Sirius being ascendant.&quot;<br><br>The HP wiki says that any chicken&#39;s egg can be used to make a Basilisk if it&#39;s hatched by a toad, though, so I&#39;ll defer to the HP continuum first in that case.</p>

            <p>Then again, the first version of the basilisk myth I heard (after <i>Harry Potter</i>) stated that the rooster&#39;s egg had to be yolkless, which I guess has a certain kind of Fridge Logic about it since, well, would the rooster be able to fertilize its own egg and okay this discussion is getting weird. :P<br><br>But generally, people don&#39;t specify hens lay eggs when they say &#39;that chicken laid an egg&#39; because it&#39;s assumed the layer was a hen. So I&#39;m going to go out on a limb and say the rooster doesn&#39;t come into the <i>Harry Potter</i> myth.</p>

            <p>I think one of Voyd&#39;s missions had him &quot;covered in giant spiders&quot;, so it&#39;s possible that the mini-Acromantulas are fairly small, even if they&#39;re bigger than fist-sized. I&#39;ve reworded the sentences to make the scale of the minis more ambiguous, but I guess that was worth bringing up. (The thought of Ripper getting mobbed by a dog-sized spider is indeed humorous, though. It&#39;s a shame I couldn&#39;t find a place for Falchion to make any comparisons to Ariados or Galvantula!

            <p>Of all the hundreds of spin-offs out there—and I&#39;m pretty sure &quot;hundreds&quot; is right—how many can <i>you</i> point to and say &quot;Oh yeah, every single moment of that was so awesome!

            <p>I&#39;ll respond to that last thing first: I&#39;m naturally a gloomy person who expects the worst from himself and his actions.<br><br>I do enjoy writing... But things stop being fun for me if the people around me don&#39;t enjoy it. If my writing, missions or otherwise, isn&#39;t interesting (which, for the most part, seems to be the case), then I don&#39;t feel like I should continue.<br><br>I get that my natural gloom scares people off, but I don&#39;t know how else to think of a consistent lack of success. As I&#39;ve mentioned, Fade to Black is the only thing I&#39;ve written that I feel like I did a good job with. The rest are boring at best, and at worst...

            <p>Would it help if I said that I like the direction Kala and Valon are going to? Because I do. They&#39;re interesting characters, and your missions with them are not too shabby (read: enjoyable). As Nesh said, not every mission is OMFGBQQ brilliant. A lot of mission are &#39;OK, I had a good laugh, I enjoyed the banter, even though it&#39;s nothing out of ordinary&#39;. To use a somewhat confusing metaphor, it&#39;s a bit like Beethoven and Bach. Beethoven is all about NEW THINGS! AND PASSION! AND MUSICAL LARGE HAM! Bach, on the other hand, is about as musically conservative as you can get, but he took the conservative forms of his time and worked them so well to deserved the title of Master. <br>I think that you&#39;re trying to be Beethoven and getting down because you don&#39;t seem to succeed; I&#39;d suggest trying for Bach, instead, and if the fates will smile on you, you&#39;ll get to Beethoven anyway.<br>(Disclosure: I prefer Bach. Beethoven&#39;s a bit too messy for me.)</p>

            <p>I&#39;m tempted to quote Thomas Edison here—I haven&#39;t failed, I&#39;ve just found three hundred things that don&#39;t work, or however that goes. I sorta feel like it might be a wasted effort, though, since you seem hell-bent on refusing any of the advice people have been trying to give you here.<br><br>Here&#39;s another quote: The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results.&quot; Instead of immediately shooting everything down, <i>try</i> things. They may not work, in which case you won&#39;t be any worse off than you are now, but then again, they <i>might</i>.<br><br>The thing you&#39;re doing here that really bugs me, though, is that you&#39;re basically making us responsible for your happiness, which is not fair. You say you&#39;re just naturally gloomy, but you COULD be having fun writing if only people enjoyed your work. To me, that translates to &quot;If you give me positive reviews, I&#39;ll have fun and be happy! So why oh why won&#39;t anyone say nice things to me?&quot; And the answer is that it&#39;s not our responsibility. Absolute power over someone else&#39;s happiness is a power too great and terrible for me. I don&#39;t want it, and I refuse to accept it. If you want to go on being gloomy and negative forever, that&#39;s your decision and yours alone. If, however, you want to knock it off and see where a positive outlook gets you instead... that&#39;s still your decision and yours alone. And if it works, it&#39;s your success, not ours, which is why taking responsibility for yourself is always the best choice.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I used to have an attention complex myself, and my very first PPC mission (&quot;Connecting The Dots&quot;) pointedly shows how well that went. I write PPC missions because I love to write. I love to write certain characters, I love to write about certain topics, and I love to write stories. It&#39;s that kind of mentality that I&#39;d highly recommend, because that&#39;ll give you a greater sense of fulfillment than writing just for attention.

            <p>I believe I e-mailed you a detailed response to your concerns last night, which was in complete agreement with the rest of the Boarders, but I totally forgot to add another thing, so yeah. There IS such a thing as working too quickly, and that goes for PPC writing as well as... well... anything else. Cranking out missions almost nonstop is good and all, because it shows that you&#39;re working hard on killing badfics and the like, which is why I do it as well. And I know full well that you&#39;re really dedicated to killing badfic! :D<br><br>The thing is, though, if you focus more on the QUANTITY than the QUALITY, namely by getting the badfic out of the way rather than making a good story, it will come across as exactly that, getting the badfic out of the way. I try to put at least some effort into my missions even if they end up way too short to avoid this exact problem. And I can attest that quality work takes time, so instead of writing to kill the badfic, I&#39;d suggest focusing on the QUALITY rather than the QUANTITY. In other words, I would wholeheartedly recommend writing to create a story about your agents AROUND killing the badfic the way I do (rather than just sporking the fic by itself), and taking more time with your missions so you can produce a better result. Slow and steady wins the race, as they say.</p>

            <p>Maybe I&#39;m missing something here, but... as far as I&#39;m aware, the PPC is not about &quot;killing badfics&quot;. I mean, that&#39;s certainly one interpretation of what we do, but we try to offer concrit and, as was said fairly recently (I think by hS, though I&#39;m not positive), we make something good--missions--out of something... the word used was &#39;bad&#39;, but I&#39;m going to go with &#39;less good&#39;--badfics.<br><br>The whole point is quality.

            <p>Weird like, Butthole Surfers or Frank Zappa weird. Or watch weird movies. Go out and do something random, then think about what that action says about you. Indulge in chaos, insanity, and weirdness whenever possible, and you&#39;ll get something new that&#39;s good. Also, come up with five ideas for the PPC &#39;verse, then post them and watch the reactions. Even if you have to use the process of elimination, the odds are almost 100% that you&#39;ll get a few good ideas out there. And in order to decide your ideas, combine some of them, and for others, roll a d20 or other appropriately sized deciding-mechanism.

<li> Focus on your characters.  You don&#39;t have to write about them as agents, or doing agent-related things.  One thing that&#39;s helped me is figuring out what kind of music my characters like.  (Natasha&#39;s favorite band is Van Halen, Aaron&#39;s is The Ink Spots.)  Heck, I&#39;ve got a whole file of them just randomly interacting, snippets of which may or may not ever see the light of day.  Just imagine them interacting with each other - arguing over music, sharing a favorite movie, complaining about the food in the cafeteria.<br><br>2. Pick a less formulaic mission.  Almost all of them are super-short missions starring character replacements.  I know you said that that&#39;s the theme for Valon and Kala, but if you&#39;re feeling like it&#39;s holding you back, then ditch it.  Make them do a Bad Slash mission or go up against a completely original Sue.  Or just have them do a longer mission; I think that would be a good way to get a little more character development in, just because they would interact more.  <strike>I can totally write you Varian/Radovan badfic epic or something.</strike>  Have them do more co-writes; I should probably do a solo mission first, but I&#39;d totally be up for doing a collab mission with you if there&#39;s one you&#39;ve got in mind.<br><br>3. As far as dinner dates go, maybe take a page from Kala&#39;s home continuum.  Remember, she&#39;s not just a girl, she&#39;s a liminal.  What do scorpions eat?  Do they have any weird habits?  What about ties to Babylonian mythology?  There&#39;s your potential story hook.<br><br>I want to apologize if I came off, or continue to come off, as overly negative.  Unfortunately, I typically find more to say when there&#39;s something I want to criticize than if I simply enjoy something.<br></li>

            <p>As DawnFire said, that discounts the entirely of the Infrastructure departments. Some of my favorite PPC stories (like &quot;<a href="http://starshadowhall.tripod.com/ppc/ficpsych/tenyearshence.html">Ten Years Hence: Henry</a>&quot;) involve no badfic whatsoever.<br><br>But even beyond that, the PPC is more than just a framework for sporking. There are plenty of MST-focused groups out there if that&#39;s all you want to do. The PPC, however, is a world unto itself. These characters are and should be more than just thin pastiches of us sent in to complain about badfic. They have lives, loves, quirks, fears, and all sorts of other good stuff.</p>

            <p>What are all the Infrastructure agents, then? They don&#39;t take on missions at all. Are you going to tell me that someone like Nurse Jenni (who&#39;s been on maybe one or two Action Department missions as a sort of consultant, if I remember, though she mainly appears as, well, a nurse) is just a random character in a PPC wrapper?

They might not take on a mission in that story, but they&#39;re still agents, it still informs their conversation and the events in their lives.<br><br>Just because we don&#39;t see them doing their job right now doesn&#39;t mean that they no longer have it, or that it in no way affects them.<br><br>~DF</p>

            <p>Most agents, when taken out of the PPC&#39;s context, are &#39;just random characters&#39;, because agents are characters. Valon and Kala are interesting in and of themselves, not because they&#39;re agents. It&#39;s like how Diziet Sma is an interesting character in and of herself, not because she&#39;s a Special Circumstances <s>agent</s> pawn.<br><br>Just... chillax, take a break, write other stuff for a while.

            <p>The solution to not having formulaic missions or just going through the motions isn&#39;t to just chuck random ideas around. Take your Shades Of Rose one. It&#39;s <i>daft</i>. It doesn&#39;t actually contribute anything to PPC lore - hell, I&#39;m pretty sure it actually <i>contradicts</i> bits of it, particularly concerning how Mary-Sue Factories work - and it came across to me like you thought your agents weren&#39;t getting enough attention so you&#39;d try and follow in Ix&#39;s wake, and then say <i>your</i> agents had taken down Rose Potter. Kind of. A bit. Ish. If you take a sort of Buddhist view of it, anyway. Leastways, that&#39;s how it felt to me, but I&#39;m on the record as not liking your agents very much.<br><br>The problem with people not being interested in your agents isn&#39;t solved by giving them new villains (well, for given values of new) or shiny new toys, for the same reason that we dissuade newbies from just making agents who are J. Random Species-haver. It&#39;s solved by making them more fleshed out, by thinking about them in greater detail. See, I think of your agents as just that - agents. An amorphous mass with the occasional interesting idea poking out from the sludge. I&#39;ve yet to think of any of them as <i>people</i>, even of the cartoonish variety like with... er... well, with all my agents, actually. Comedy Happy!Agent, Comedy Horrible!Agent, and Comedy Forn Parts!Agent all send their regards.<br><br>Figure out what your agents are like. What do they do in what little spare time they get? What kind of things do they enjoy getting to see? Stuff like that. What you have to do to get people to like your agents is to figure out <i>who they are</i>. I&#39;m not 100% convinced you&#39;ve done that yet; mostly, I get the feeling you had a checklist and ticked off characteristics. Don&#39;t get me wrong, that&#39;s a good place to start. It&#39;s just not a good place to finish.<br><br>Something that might also serve you well is to leave more of a gap between your missions. You&#39;ve been cranking these things out at a rate of knots since you got permission, and while it&#39;s great that you evidently love writing missions this much, well, it might be part of the problem, at least a little bit. Get some more ideas. Let them percolate in the ol&#39; brain a bit more. Give your agents a bit more room to breathe - because <i>my</i> biggest complaint about 512-3 is that it felt weirdly rushed, like you were struggling to meet a deadline and your boss was breathing down your neck - and give them time. You don&#39;t have to charge down badfics like you&#39;re the only thing between them and the try line. Give it time. More haste, less speed. =]<br><br>Also - missions have to be super-formulaic, do they? News to me. Just for that, I&#39;m gonna do one entirely in haiku. Haikoo? Yeah, that sounds like a good title. =]<br><br>---<br><br>*<s>Film at eleven</s></p>

            <p>The more you write, the more practice you get, the better you will become. Trying too hard is just hard on you.<br><br>I don&#39;t know why you write; but I write because it&#39;s fun, because it&#39;s something I&#39;ve been doing since I figured out how, because I feel off-kilter if I stop for long enough.<br><br>How do characters become beloved? Look. Yes, there will be some--like, say, the Notary, or Zeb, perhaps--who become instant favorites through some quirk of personality or whatever else. But there are also characters who grow on you only after you&#39;ve read more about them, or who only grow on you once they&#39;ve gone through some character development. (And no character is universally liked, I don&#39;t think.)<br><br>Try writing some interludes, character studies, things like that. Develop your characters, work with them, love them. Write things with them, missions or otherwise. Focus on what makes a good story, on what the characters are telling you to do, on what feels right. Practice writing description, dialogue, whatever you think would be good. You want more spice? Well, banter is often in that category: how do your characters talk to each other? How do they talk to themselves, to badfics, to random people making too much noise in the hallways? To their minis? Think about it. Let scenes play out in your head. Spend some time with your characters.<br><br>Another thing you can do, is try rping or co-writing. That would give you the opportunity to figure out how your characters would speak to other agents, how they&#39;d respond to different people. I don&#39;t know how Kala would react to Dawn; I do know that Dawn might well scream if she saw Kala at a point before she became immune to things like randomly appearing Balrogs (of the non-attacking variety). At this point, she would probably gape for a bit, and then keep a respectful distance.<br><br>Why do I know this? Because I&#39;ve spent rather a lot of time in Dawn&#39;s headspace lately. I&#39;ve written dialogue, I&#39;ve thought about how she would react to many, many situations, and I&#39;ve given her the opportunity to play around in some of them, AU or otherwise. But even with that, I&#39;d need to actually plunk her down into a situation where she was speaking with Kala in order to know how they&#39;d get along--and for that, I&#39;d need you. One thing I&#39;ve found is that characters who are being written by someone who is not you, in the same story as your own characters, can lead to many surprises. They don&#39;t always react the way you think they will, for one thing.<br><br>For another? Let&#39;s say I&#39;m positive that Dawn and Kala will get along, so I convince you to co-write an interlude. But then, we begin writing, and suddenly--they&#39;re arguing. It wasn&#39;t planned, it just...happened. Something in Dawn&#39;s characterization made her react to something Kala said or did, and vice versa, and suddenly--completely unplanned--we have a slice of drama. And that can be pretty fun.<br><br>I&#39;m not entirely sure how useful any or all of this is to you, but my advice is--when boiled down--to spend time with you characters, not stress too much about making a mark (focus on what makes a good story for your characters instead), and to try out writing with other people (even if it&#39;s just an rp or an interlude!) The last one will expose you to different types of characters, and different writing styles, in a different way than simply reading about them will do. And it&#39;s also just plain fun: case in point, Iximaz and I have been co-writing for just about the past week, and have discovered that two of our characters actually have a *lot* in common--and are prone to drama when put together, simply because of certain events in their shared past (which, of course, didn&#39;t exist until we started talking)! It&#39;s been rather a whirlwind, in the fun sort of way.<br><br>One more thing, though, in response to your last line: nothing separates your work from anyone else&#39;s? If you say so, but I&#39;d like to disagree. If that were the case, I probably wouldn&#39;t remember the names of your characters, or tiny bits of their interactions. I&#39;m not saying there&#39;s nothing you can improve, but honestly? Your characters are not boring. Continue developing them, and I think you could end up with some pretty great results. And that&#39;s not nothing.<br><br>~DF<br><br>PS: Lastly, if all that wasn&#39;t enough, I&#39;d like to point you to article 28 of the PPC Constitution, which might be a good thing to bear in mind:<br><br>28. Remember to have FUN. FUN is good.<br><br>And, honestly, that&#39;s a main element of the PPC. That&#39;s why we write missions and so on, apart from wanting to provide concrit and make a good story out of a badfic and so on.<br><br>We write, and we discuss, and we have fun doing it. I understand wanting to make a mark, all of that--but if you focus only on that, your stories suffer, your characters suffer, and it just gets less fun for everyone.<br><br>Just write, with an eye towards fun, good stories, and skill development, and you&#39;ll be on the right track.<br><br>Good luck!</p>

            <p>I would do more collaborative writing, but usually everyone else is busy. I was super-surprised when Ix decided to jump on board for Midnight Green. Plus I&#39;m terrible at multitasking; I can really only devote myself to one project at a time, and with Midnight Green in progress, I can&#39;t really work on anything else.<br><br>I&#39;d be willing to join RPs, but I don&#39;t know how to start them, and I&#39;ve kinda proven myself to be a bad roleplayer anyway.</p>

            <p>But first, my thoughts on the story. It&#39;s very well-written, and I liked the way the different characters played off of each other. However, where does Corolla get the idea that there&#39;s some UST between Rina and the Librarian? It&#39;s clear from Zeb&#39;s lines that Rina likes Des, but where does the Librarian figure into the picture?<br><br>As for the errors themselves:<br><i>Zeb readied another portal, but the scene suddenly went black. Something struck Des on the forehead, and he cursed.<br><br>“I hate stray punctuation.” He looked at the Words and groaned. “That’s one of the silliest scene breaks I’ve ever seen.”<br><br> ...<br><br>Des barely managed to say “fantastic” when the scene went black again. His forehead attracted a hail of tildes again, prompting him to curse, then the fic dumped him and Zeb in the Great Hall again.&quot;</i><br><br>I find it odd that you refer to &quot;stray punctuation&quot; first, and only clarify that you were referring to an all-tilde scene break paragraphs later. When I first saw the reference to &quot;stray punctuation,&quot; I was looking at the previous quote from the badfic to see if there was any punctuation missing; I did not make the connection between the two sentences. In other words, I thought that Des was complaining about <i>two</i> things: some stray punctuation and a non-standard scene break. Please consider rephrasing these paragraphs to clarify up front that the scene break manifested as a rain of tildes.<br><br><i>They appeared back outside of Number Four. Dumbledore, Mad-Eye, and Kingsley, among other unnamed Aurors were working on breaking through the new wards</i><br>There should be a comma after &quot;Aurors&quot;<br><br><i>Charge for distorting earth’s history</i><br>Capitalize the E in &quot;earth&quot;<br><br><i>it was just a matter of keeping them shrinked to scale model size</i><br>&quot;shrunk&quot;, not &quot;shrinked&quot;<br><br><i>“We’re doing a multi-team mission, so sending in a team composed by people from the same RC kinda misses the point. And you two need to sort out this Belligerent Sexual Tension of yours.”<br><br>Corolla stopped in thought for a second, then continued. “And if any one of you two stays here, I’m going to tease him or her until the team comes back.”</i><br><br>Since Corolla is the speaker for both lines, please consider either removing the paragraph break or adding some kind of attribution to the first paragraph.<br><br><i>barrell roll</i> <br>That&#39;s misspelled: there&#39;s only one L in &quot;barrel&quot;.<br>Also, <a href="https://paladin283.files.wordpress.com/2010/04/remiq-net_8233.jpg">do you mean &quot;aileron roll,&quot; or are you referring to an actual barrel roll?</a></p>

            <p>I should probably start off by saying that I&#39;m not much of a <i>Harry Potter</i> fan. My knowledge of the canon itself is both shaky and possibly out of date. So I can&#39;t really comment too much on that regard.<br><br>Despite that, I still found the mission to be enjoyable. The characters had some very good interactions and there were some extremely solid moments. My favorite would have to be when the Librarian and Zeb have their brief discussion about fanonical interpretations on page 34. I feel like sometimes PPC writers forget that, so it&#39;s nice to see it talked about in-universe.<br><br>I did have a few issues, most of which are tied to my own subjective views. There were a smattering of points where it felt like what the agents were saying didn&#39;t necessarily fit their actions. Like on page 7: &quot;<i>“I heard that,” the Librarian said weakly, but Des ignored him.</i>&quot; Why would his protest be weak? I didn&#39;t anything to indicate why that would be so.<br><br>I&#39;m also not a fan of when agents have overblown reactions. The whole banging your head on the wall thing. I feel like that&#39;s okay if it fits the character of the agent, like if they&#39;re literally a cartoon character or something similar. It also works better as a one time thing. But when it&#39;s a character that&#39;s supposed to be from a more reality-based world (like Des) and it happens repeatedly, the entire thing feels forced. There are humorous ways to express that a character is frustrated without immediately jumping into broad physical comedy.<br><br>A good mission all in all. I struggled a bit at times (due to the previously mentioned Harry Potter antipathy) but it was still easy enough to follow. Well done.</p>

            <p>Om nom nom.<br><br>*pointedly ignores the <i>Harry Potter</i> non-fanness* :P<br><br>Glad to hear you liked it! And that moment you mentioned between Zeb and the Librarian was a nice one to write; and you&#39;re right, fanon and canon does seem to blur as time goes on. Distinctions are important.<br><br>Unfortunately, I can&#39;t really remark on Des&#39; agents, so I&#39;ll leave that to him should he choose to respond.

            <p>That said, I&#39;d like to address the points you&#39;ve brought up.<br>The one on page seven is probably me not being clear enough; I was referring to the volume of his voice, not his... will to protest?<br>The wall-head one - well, Des is an SI (even though he drifts further and further apart from me as time goes by), and I tend to actually do that when I&#39;m faced with something stupid enough.

            <p>Also, check yourself before you wreck yourself in future. Just because you don&#39;t understand what words mean doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;re not words.<br><br>To take an example, when I posted the first mission for Doktor Trollenfisch, I used the word pleonasm. Repeatedly. Which was kind of the joke, because pleonasm means... well, <a href="http://lmgtfy.com/?q=define%3A+pleonasm">see for yourself</a>. Now, Neshomeh of this parish hadn&#39;t come across the word before, which is understandable, because it&#39;s fairly obscure and archaic. Rather than try to claim I&#39;d made it up, like you did with the word reprogramme seriously how have you not heard of this word, she looked up what it meant and wandered off to give it a cuddle.<br><br>This is the proper reaction to things you don&#39;t know: finding out.

            <p>Just that I disagree with your assessment. And would probably chalk up most of your quibbles to differences in dialect, tone, and so forth. I&#39;m a pretty technically competent writer, and the only one that stuck out for me was the Librarian describing Godric&#39;s Hollow as in &quot;West Country, England&quot;, which a) is not how one talks about the West Country, b) is a little vague for someone with Time Lord levels of memory, and c) might not be totally correct - I&#39;ve had it stuck in my head for years that Godric&#39;s Hollow was in Wales, though I may well be wrong about that.<br><br>But yeah, interested to see your list, but I&#39;ll wait for Hieronymous&#39;s, if it&#39;s all the same. Not being funny, mate, but when it comes to this stuff he&#39;s got form.</p>

            <p>And thank you very much!<br><br>Anyway, parentheses- I originally intended for there to be ten lines between each aside, but it looks like I miscounted the middle one, so it goes ten lines, eleven lines, ten lines, three; which isn&#39;t so bad. <br><br>I also like repetition in poems- each parenthetical remark ends with the same word, has internal rhyme, and says &quot;for, you see,&quot; which I like the sound of. In addition, I really enjoyed using them as a sort of direct remark to the reader.<br><br>And the summing up of feelings should really be attributed to Iximaz- if I hadn&#39;t read her motto, I wouldn&#39;t have written the poem, and the motto really is brilliant. &quot;Because I write, I am free.&quot; Such good words. </p>

Some of the OC&#39;s, particularly Harry&#39;s therapist, I like! Then come the badfic tropes. And boy howdy, do they pour in thick an&#39; fast. There is, for instance, an honest-to-god ninja teaching mentally unstable children how to kick lumps out of each other. Then Harry gets possessed and de-aged in his own brain in scenes that are extremely uncomfortable. The he gets superpowers from the spirit of Merlin. Did I mention this was all happening while he was receiving direct tuition from Voldemort through some kind of shared dream-state thingummy that I&#39;m fairly certain Potterverse magic cannot do? And then it all spirals into nonsense. <i>More</i> into nonsense. Especially when bleedin&#39; <i>Dracula</i> shows up.<br><br>I think part of my reticence is tied up in the fact that this is goodfic gone bad. I think another part is that this is one of the most reviewed HP stories on the Pit. More than fourteen thousand people have shown up to give their thoughts on it! Jesus. I don&#39;t think there&#39;s been fourteen thousand responses to all the PPC missions written <i>put together</i>. People think it&#39;s good, I suppose.<br><br>Oh well.

As he is dying, he says his final wish, However the decaying grail somehow fulfills his wish by replacing his soul into Harry Potter&#39;s body, after the Dementor attack in Book 4(?). Soon, he is an active participant of a battle between the Death Eaters and the populace of Great Britain.<br><br>One major problem that I can see in this fic though is how Nasuverse magecraft system can work in a Harry Potter universe. Also, the character Adam Greengrass does have the potential to be a Gary Stu, as he is also trying to defeat Voldemort while having a Dark Mark himself.<br><br>But this is still very early, with only 9 chapters.

            <p>If I recall correctly, Shirou here does act as a consequence of the Archer route. In fact, he is slowly turning to EMIYA, through the murders of the Death Eaters.<br><br>As for the vigilante murders of Death Eaters, I must agree, the murders may adversely change Harry Potter plot. Also Adam Greengrass looks like an OC, which also may soon, or have already become a Gary Stu.<br><br>As for Magic systems, I do realise that Harry Potter may not have Magic Circuits, and if he does, Shirou may not be able to Project from Harry&#39;s body.<br><br>Having read nine chapters, I find that Shirou as predictably as he is in his canon. Getting ready to defend himself when thrown to a new situation, hiding informations until it is considered necessary, strategising how to navigate through Potterverse, those are the marks of an Emiya Shirou that has already survived his Holy Grail War.<br><br>However, there could be something that I missed from the story.</p>

            <p>Taking a look at just the first chapter, it looks bad, but I&#39;m not really convinced of its missionability, to coin a term.  I&#39;ll stick it in my list of &quot;fics for consideration,&quot; see if I come up with anything for it.<br><br>On a more general note, I feel like a lot of Fate/ fans kind of miss a recurring theme in the series, which is that losing sight of your ideals ultimately leads to just as much pain as clinging too tightly to them.  Archer is cool, yes, but in the end he hates what he&#39;s become just as much (if not more than) he hates what he was.  And I think post-UBW, Shirou would go out of his way to not become like Archer; he&#39;s seen what comes of that, after all.<br><br>Honestly, I&#39;d say that the main difference between Harry and Shirou is that Harry tends to be a little quicker on the uptake and actually has a sense of self-preservation.  </p>

            <p>The cartoon, I mean. I&#39;ve seen a handful of episodes, but, well.<br><br><a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8389755/1/Ultimate-Teen-Titans">Ultimate Teen Titans</a> is a crossover where Spider-Man somehow nearly dies and gets sent to the Teen Titans universe. Upon arrival, Raven - ie, the character who has literally read one person&#39;s mind in the series, and that only when that person was hallucinating and in a ton of danger - broadcasts the contents of Spidey&#39;s mind to the team. And it only gets better from there, folks! There&#39;s plenty of stuff showing how Peter is a much better fighter than the Titans, nonsensical stuff about secret identities (the Titans are public figures, author!) and Deadpool and Slade are apparently siblings. For... some reason. </p>

            <p>... and got some very interesting things. First of all, is a triple crossover, is misclassified and is <i>a ten fics long</i> series. Okay explaining now the two first ones now, the fic combines elements from both the <i>Teen Titans</i> animated series and the <i>New Teen Titans</i> comic book series (like Titans Tower being in San Francisco instead of Jump City), that&#39;s why it&#39;s a triple crossover. Which leads me to the next point, the fic is not a crossover with the <i>Ultimate Spider-Man</i> animated series, is a crossover with the <i>comic book series of the same name</i>. That&#39;s why Peter Parker dies at the start of the fic. In fact this gets fixed later by the author by filling parts 3 to 10 under &quot;Ultimate Marvel&quot;.<br><br>That being said, the things that bothered me were: Peter&#39;s unexplained interdimesional travel, Cinderblock&#39;s unexplained power and intelligence upgrade, Raven is slightly OOC, and the fact that Spidey&#39;s and Raven&#39;s relationship progresses a little too fast. <br><br>All in all, and considering the continua involved, I judge this crossover to be <i>plausible</i>. Yes, that includes Deadpool&#39;s Fourth Wall breaking interdimensional travel. Even Raven falling for Spider-Man, since she actually fell for Beast Boy in the New Earth DCU continuum, and those two are very much alike. And the bit of Deadpool and Deathstroke being siblings, is quite likely a joke, referencing the fact that Deadpool is a parody/rip-off of Deathstroke, <a href="http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113883/2164436-deadpool_vs_deathstroke.jpg">a joke even DC Comics has dabbled into.</a> The SPaG gets better as the fic progresses and yes, Ultimate Peter Parker is that awesome, in fact, <i>he&#39;s inmortal!</i><br><br>In other words, I won&#39;t take any part in any sporking of this fic, I have definitively seen worse and more spork-worthy fics than this one. Is not the best by any means, but I don&#39;t see it bad enough for Mission material.</p>

            <p>This is not a post announcing new missions.<br><br>It <i>is</i>, however, a post announcing the slow republishing of my old missions which can now partially be found <a href="http://agent_july.dreamwidth.org">here</a> with more to come as time permits so that people can stop spamming my inbox with requests,  truly. More will be going up as time permits on my end.<br><br>So far this only holds the first five missions I wrote, and a couple interludes. These haven&#39;t been edited or touched since they were originally beta read, pretty much,  and my writing has improved muchly since then as well.  So you can consider these museum pieces, essentially, as far as the PPC goes since this first set were written in early 2008, with my very first written in late 2007.<br><br>To put in perspective how long ago that was for you new folks, hS was still single, childless and had flowing locks, Neshomeh was also as yet unmarried and had longer hair as well and Phobos I will no doubt be assured was just as hairy then as he is now, if not more so, besides not even having joined at that point in time. Though, perhaps the beard was not as epic.<br><br>Truly, these first missions are so old that if they were children, they would be attending school. (Gasp!)<br><br>Needless to say, I welcome new readers and comments; while concrit will never go awry, please keep in mind how old these are. I&#39;ll definitely take it anyways, especially if there are any errors that have snuck in still. <br><br>Cheers,<br>July</p>

            <p>Not the one with Scissorman on the cover, but the original 1995 one? I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if nobody has even heard of it, but it&#39;s awesome. And, in case someone knows what I&#39;m talking about, has anyone ever seen any goodfic from it? I would browse The Pit, but I&#39;m too sick to really focus on that many stories right now. If there&#39;s no goodfic, I might try to write some. The first of a well-loved genre deserves that much. Specifically, the survival horror genre, in case that piques your interest in it.</p>

            <p>...I think the idea of a Sue-wraith being purified and turned into a more plausible character would be a fascinating idea. As far as I know, my own Cupid Carmine is the ONLY case of this happening on an official mission. (No, E.V.L. doesn&#39;t count. She was an OC I had in the works for YEARS before joining the Board.)<br><br>Like I said earlier, I&#39;d like to see how other Boarders would handle the same concept. An agent who was once a Sue-wraith would be similar to an ex-Sue, sure, but I think there&#39;s a difference in that the Sue-wraith: 1) had no physical form at all prior to being exorcised and purified, and 2) directly possessed a canon rather than just Suefluencing him or her. Those two aspects were things I think I covered pretty well in the aftermath of Cupid&#39;s creation - not just with him being ticklish and the like but also the more obvious prospect of having a physical body i.e. he probably went &quot;OMG HOW DO I LEGS&quot; after not having any for over thirty years in the context of his homefic, and had to start over practicing everything from walking to manipulating objects to wearing clothes and stuff.<br><br>So yeah. I would really like to see a purified Sue-wraith happen in someone else&#39;s work. They&#39;d probably handle it very differently from what I did, but that would probably for the better. Variety is the spice of life, as they say.</p>

            <p>Pulling out one-off things is exactly what I enjoy doing in other fandoms - notably LotR - and it&#39;s exactly what I&#39;d love to see more of in the PPC.<br><br>Some ideas:<br><br>1/ The <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/PPC_Nac_Mac_Feegle_Clan">PPC clan of Nac Mac Feegle</a>. What&#39;re these guys up to? Are they employed, or just resident? Do they, by any chance, go on missions?<br>2/ Intelligence reports.

But there&#39;s no reason people can&#39;t write these <i>when they post a badfic</i>.

It&#39;s weird, it&#39;s meta, it&#39;s been used... maybe once?<br>4/ Can I be cheeky and say &#39;divisions&#39;? I don&#39;t think there&#39;s <i>any</i> agents around these days who go exclusively into one canon.

            <p>There are some things in old spin-offs I&#39;ve wanted to reference eventually.  I probably won&#39;t get to all of them, and probably can&#39;t think of all of them off the top of my head.  But anyway:<br><br><a href="http://aramel.bizhat.com/fanfics/ppc/index.html">Aramel&#39;s spin-off</a> is, uh.  Quite different.  But one thing I do like about it is <a href="http://aramel.bizhat.com/fanfics/ppc/ppc2.html">the Angel&#39;s Trumpet</a>.  I like the idea of the Flowers having their own &quot;announcer.&quot;  I know it&#39;s been contradicted a dozen times since with human announcers, but I&#39;m just immensely amused by this guy.  Maybe he was used before the consoles got an upgrade for ICEP?  (Also, Trojie and Pads used <a href="http://rc45.dreamwidth.org/46348.html">another Angel&#39;s Trumpet</a> (Warning for drug references!) in one of their stories.  I listed them as separate characters on the Wiki, due to their differing personalities, but it&#39;s ultimately a question of headcanon, I guess.)<br><br>The green man named Greenman!  I think he wins the prize for least memorable Original Series character.  Yeah, Jay and Acacia <a href="http://plotprotectors.tripod.com/TOS/mission20.html">wrote him</a>; be honest, and admit you had no idea he existed until just now.  (Unless you are Neshomeh or July, because I know you two have read the Original Series multiple dozens of times.)  Anyway, the Greenman  also <a href="http://responcecenter81.webs.com/exploringhq.htm">appears here</a>, and is involved in weapons training—Wait.<br><br>Wait.<br><br><i>&quot;Questions to be filed in the box!&quot; the instructor snapped, waving a frond.<br><br>&quot;I wasn&#39;t asking anything,&quot; Acacia muttered.<br><br>&quot;Comments filed in the box!&quot; the Greenman said, his jolly face twitching.</i><br><br>The.  Greenman has a.  Frond.  I.  Never noticed before.  He&#39;s not a.  Green.  Man.  He&#39;s.  A Flower?  is there such a thing as a—<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Man">Ooooooooh</a>.  How much do you want to bet this myth has a Czech variant Jay knew about?<br><br>Well.  My worldview is shattered.  I think it&#39;s time for bed now.

            <p>I remember one (probably rather old) mission where the agents outright admitted that they didn’t know whether it would be necessary to neuralyze the canons after slaying the Sue, and just did it to be rather safe than sorry. In this case it may have been justified by them being Floaters and used to neuralyzing everybody after an exorcism.

            <p>The Green Man is a pretty common notion over here (my parents have a Green Man face in their garden, for example), and we know that Jay was a big Anglophile.

One is that Kitty and Kay are too young. I don&#39;t remember who said that over the time agents got older as the Boarders did, but a) it&#39;s true and b) the general consensus today is &quot;no agents below teen age&quot;, especially since being an agent is no job for a little kid. 12-13 is really pushing it, I think. The second is that torture is forbidden - yes, torturing Sues is <i>verboten</i>, too. (That won&#39;t be a problem if Kay won&#39;t follow through on his plans.) The third and last one is that I don&#39;t think the Flowers would particularly mind two more non-Suvian people in HQ.

            <p>(I&#39;d dusted off my hat and all, but Des got in first. So take these as just comments. ;))<br><br>Kitty is... very very loud. I think practically every line she said was yelled, shrieked, or otherwise exclaimed. Gonna be honest, that&#39;s going to wear thin quickly. As in, it already did. (The character, not you.)<br><br>There have been very young agents in action departments before: <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1S-_a2DzzqizVpZA5DcZoaU6CR5MqqE5Cqj4vsvJE4AE/pub">Constance was thirteen</a>, for instance. The evidence suggests that the Flowers do <i>not</i> think early teens is too young (and besides, saying you couldn&#39;t write a character your own age would be pretty silly). I&#39;m not complaining about that.<br><br>My concerns are these:<br><br>-Kitty is very screechy. I know you&#39;re excited, but your agent doesn&#39;t need to be all the time. Think about how (in)frequently Jay displayed her &#39;flake&#39; tendencies: she didn&#39;t spend her entire time spouting random nonsense, she just put it on occasionally.<br><br>-The &#39;methodically violent torture&#39; part. I <i>know</i> you know the PPC doesn&#39;t torture. I honestly think this is just bad wording on your part - I think your meaning was either &#39;creative assassination&#39; or &#39;tormenting Sues&#39; (like Acacia&#39;s &#39;burrs in the shoes&#39; thing). Possibly both.<br><br>-That backstory. Um, two kids beat up a veteran agent, who then let them follow him back to HQ? Then the Flowers wanted to get rid of them, but gave them a job instead? Was dropping them through a portal too much work?<br><br>Honestly, it feels like you didn&#39;t have an idea for how to bring them into the PPC, and just threw something together in five minutes. So... can you come up with something more logically coherent? Silly question - I&#39;m pretty sure you can.<br><br>hS</p>

I needed to hear all of this, and I&#39;m glad both of you said it.<br><br>Now that I look back at my writing, I do notice that agent!Kitty <i>is</i> quite loud.

The comments were as follows.<br>&quot;This is generally very much frowned upon, and does make him appear more psychopathic/sociopathic than you may perhaps want.&quot;<br>&quot;Aren’t most 12 year old boys little sociopaths and &quot;all about wanton violence against villains&quot;, to quote Huinesoron? Judging from the ridiculous prerequisites for the given example, Kay’s “creative ideas” are impractical and will be played for fun.&quot;<br>&quot;It could also be read as &#39;he has the Big Blue folder with the creative ideas as well as some less creative and more potentially disturbing ideas&#39;, though. It&#39;s possible that if it&#39;s meant the way HG laid out, that should be made a little clearer. I do think this could work, but...it should probably be made clear that this isn&#39;t a psychopathic/sociopathic thing like Maslab mentioned (that is, assuming that it isn&#39;t...)&quot;<br>Hope that clears up a bit of the stuff surrounding that. I&#39;ll try to edit the bio in accordance when I have a bit of time.<br><br>The backstory <i>was</i> a bit rushed. I&#39;ll wrack my brains and think of something. :-)<br><br>Thanks for all of the comments. Just to be clear, though- should I change their ages, or shouldn&#39;t I? &#39;Cause I&#39;ve got several different people telling me I should, and a bunch of others telling me it&#39;s fine. I&#39;m a bit confused.<br><br>Kitty</p>

            <p>&quot;... for they will say both no and yes.&quot;<br><br>I still think you should change the backstory. <i>But</i>, as it currently stands, it shows them as the sort of people the Flowers would recruit.<br><br>At least sort of. I don&#39;t like the idea of them randomly beating up an agent for, what, getting in the way of their cricket match? Um... could they clobber a Gary-Stu instead? One being chased by an agent, who they assume is a police officer chasing a criminal. That casts them in a rather more positive light, but still violent. They can then still sneak after the agent when he opens up a magic portal (I mean, those things don&#39;t come along every day, y&#39;know!), and even set up camp in the Cafeteria (to watch all the cool aliens).<br><br>The conversation with whoever comes along to evict them then goes roughly like this:<br><br><i>Get out of our cafeteria.</i><br>&quot;No.&quot;<br><i>Seriously, get lost.</i><br>&quot;No.&quot;<br><i>We could drop you into the multiverse&#39;s largest ocean, you know.</i><br>&quot;Bet you couldn&#39;t. Your agent couldn&#39;t even catch a guy <i>we</i> managed to stop.&quot;<br><i>... what would it take to get you to move?</i><br>&quot;Dunno. What&#39;ve you got?&quot;<br><i>We could offer you a job.</i><br>&quot;Does it involve hitting people with cricket bats?&quot;<br><i>Uh... maybe?</i><br>&quot;Great.

            <p>Everything in the books - and quite a lot outside it, given Tolkien&#39;s evident distate towards modernity that bordered on open hostility - points to the Elves being just <i>better at things</i> than other people, not that they have an actual space program. Look at Lothlorien. Now, you <i>could</i> draw parallels between a modern type of eco-friendly arcology kind of setup, but it&#39;s more likely they&#39;re just pointy-eared game poachers living in whatever wood they can scrounge up - because it&#39;s highly unlikely Tolkien would ever have even heard of modern green architecture ideas. Also, forgive me for saying so, but if you&#39;re using what basically amounts to a <i>creation myth</i> to prove that ancient elves had moon rockets then I&#39;ve got a bridge in Brooklyn as needs a buyer.</p>

            <p>Oh yeah, that&#39;s right - hobbits. Noted for being trustworthy observers of things that happened millennia before they were born.<br><br>The sad fact is that we have virtually no idea about the technology, politics, and culture of Third Age Elvendom. Mirkwood was a Kingdom - absolute monarchy or parliamentary? We don&#39;t know, except that the king apparently has some negotiating authority on the battlefield (was it George II who was the last British monarch to engage in combat?). Lorien has a Lord and Lady, which (given that they don&#39;t speak Westron there) is a translation of... what? We know Celeborn and Galadriel were <i>not</i> monarchs - so what was the difference? How did they take power there? Hmm, looks like they never filled Frodo in on that one.<br><br>Culturally, what was the highest form of art in Imladris at the time of the War of the Ring? Unless your answer is &#39;councils&#39;, &#39;fellowships&#39;, &#39;songs which go tra-la-la-lally&#39;, or &#39;one sword&#39;, we just don&#39;t know. How many plays came out of the Grey Havens every year? How much does a Mirkwood sculpture sell for?<br><br>What was the most powerful weapon used in the (book) Battle of Five Armies? Was it the stone that knocked Bilbo out and let him conveniently <b>not see</b> the only canonical battle involving multiple elves? What does Lorien have on hand for keeping orcs out - just a couple of guys with bows, or something they didn&#39;t want the violent mortals to know about?<br><br>How is Rivendell kept hidden when it&#39;s just, like, <i>right there</i>? How come Elrond and Galadriel know so much about what&#39;s going on far away from them? How do you trap starlight in a bottle? What kind of materials go into a &#39;magic&#39; camouflage cloak?<br><br>We know next to nothing about the elves of the Third Age. We know even less about the elves of the <i>Second</i> Age. For that matter, we don&#39;t know a whole lot about them in the First Age! Claiming they were &#39;culturally stagnant&#39; is making mountains out of moles.<br><br>hS<br><br>(Not molehills. It&#39;s harder than that. Molehills don&#39;t try to run away.)</p>

            <p>... the Professor&#39;s oft-repeated idea that the Eldar have a fixation on <i>preservation</i>.

            <p>It&#39;s my opinion that technological progress may have got us into this mess, but we ain&#39;t getting out of it by returning to feudal, scarcity-based economic structures and general-purpose Luddism. The other thing about that is that if elves are as advanced as you put about, well, they have some kind of magic-based post-scarcity society, which makes them complete tossers for not sharing with everyone else. That&#39;s what progress is <i>for</i>, after all, and if they are just about preserving the old order, that just makes them social reactionaries with no more business running a bath than a selection of city-states.</p>

            <p>Out-of-universe, they, er... well, they&#39;re the master race. Beautiful, talented, best at everything, uniformly white-skinned, and so on. It is <i>obvious</i> that that&#39;s what he&#39;s going for with them.<br><br>In-universe, there&#39;s a thing called &#39;prevailing tech level&#39; that gets bandied around in far-future SF&amp;F. The prevailing tech level in <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> is that of Europe during the tail end of the Hundred Years&#39; War. While this may not be true of the elves themselves, I think it&#39;s disingenuous to say they&#39;re <i>so</i> far ahead purely because they can perform cantrips and because the narrator comes from a society in which such things do not exist. I&#39;m not suggesting that elves could not build spaceships, given time and materials. I&#39;m saying that <i>from what we can actually deduce</i>, rather than just have a stab at because you want elves to be the most super amazing and perfectest perfs who ever perfed all over the clean linen, elves <i>haven&#39;t</i> built moon rockets and do not possess the ability to do so.<br><br>Like I said at the beginning: you believe elves built the sun and the moon - and since you must therefore ALSO believe that Middle-Earth during the Seventh Age is OUR Earth, well... no. Basically, no. All this stuff? Sailing among the stars along the straight road? It&#39;s their <i>mythology</i>. Same thing as the Greeks put their gods and heroes in the sky as constellations, and with the exact same amount of relevance to actual observable reality. It&#39;s a story. It&#39;s a pleasant story full of interesting characters, but it&#39;s a story. Otherwise Earendil&#39;s got a serious problem involing a giant-ass crab monster. =]</p>

            <p>Neither the Greek gods <i>nor the stories of Middle-earth</i> have any &#39;relevance&#39; to actual reality. Did you think I missed that part? That goes for everything - Frodo carrying a Ring about, for instance. That&#39;s a story. It&#39;s fiction.<br><br>But if Elrond told Frodo not to worry about it because Zeus would just zap Sauron because he got uppity, you&#39;d call it badfic. That&#39;s because in-universe, the Middle-earth books <u>are</u> reality.<br><br>So no, I don&#39;t think you can call something &#39;mythology&#39; which has <b>multiple living witnesses</b> in the setting. You&#39;re in exactly the same position as saying that Jay and Acacia (that&#39;s the real people, who posted on the PPC Board, to alleviate any confusion) are mythological.<br><br>Out-of-universe? That&#39;s a complicated story. &#39;Elves&#39; are a mashup of three different things:<br><br>-The ones in <i>The Hobbit</i>, who are a fairly generic fantasy obstacle. You can&#39;t really tell that they&#39;re anything other than humans, actually.<br><br>-The ones in LotR, who are... close to being background colour. What they&#39;re actually standing in for is <u>angels</u>: they&#39;re &#39;otherworldly&#39;, they&#39;re something to aspire to. They don&#39;t <b>do</b> things. Legolas can shoot a bow passably, and he... is the only elf we see doing anything producting in the entirety of LotR, I think. Oh, Glorfindel, who pulls a &#39;Road to Damascus&#39; on the Nazgul. Tolkien didn&#39;t let the Divine into the Trilogy very much, so the Eldar represent them at one remove, so to speak.<br><br>-The ones in the First Age, who are... complicated. In their original incarnation, they&#39;re somewhere between &#39;fun adventure&#39; and &#39;English mythology&#39; - that&#39;s why they&#39;re pale-skinned, since that&#39;s what England consisted of until preeeetty recently. They&#39;re a massive creation on the backs of the Sidhe and scattered related legends.<br><br>So yes, the Eldar of the First Age are... mythological characters. Were the Greeks inventing a Master Race when they told stories about Herakles and Perseus? No. Beleriand is Tolkien&#39;s attempt to create a mythology out of whole cloth, and so the characters are... mythological.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I do have some reservations. Thirteen seems awfully young for a DMS agent, and twelve is definitely too young. I&#39;m not convinced that the PPC is in the business of employing child soldiers. The idea of Kay employing an M1918 is... well, laughable, really. He&#39;d be better off with an AK-74, and that isn&#39;t just my socialist ideology talking; they&#39;re easy to maintain, extremely reliable, and well-suited to missions in modern continua. Including <i>Harry Potter</i>, come to that. I&#39;ve no idea where the idea that technology doesn&#39;t work on Hogwarts grounds comes from, but it obviously does - but that&#39;s a rant for another day.<br><br>I&#39;m also extremely worried by this line:<br><br>&quot;<i>His method of violence is planned and calculated, and he has several large folders with notes on Sue-torturing.</i>&quot;<br><br>Er, no? That&#39;s kind of the exact opposite of what the PPC is about and is so against the rules it&#39;s not funny? Um... yeah, no. I get that twelve-year-old boys have the potential to be total sociopaths (I was one, after all), but it seems doubtful that it&#39;d be to that extent. Not in a building with a dedicated psychiatric hospital in it, anyway.<br><br>As for the prompts... I find Kitty extremely grating, but that&#39;s just my personal distaste for lolrandom humour in general and children in particular. And make no mistake - these people are <i>children</i>. I would no more give a child a gun than I would a refreshing glass of battery acid. Especially not one so screwed up that she collects Nitro-9.<br><br>There are issues here. Distinct issues. And they&#39;re not just the ones your agents evidently have.<br><br>However, there is hope.<br><br>We don&#39;t have a huge amount of stories detailing the Nursery - or, for that matter, agent training (what there is of it). If they were placed <i>there</i>, and we got stories from <i>that</i> kind of perspective, with other agents who are actually of age to go on missions teaching  them how to work on missions and charge properly and not just be lolrandom and shooty, then we&#39;d have a decent series on our hands. Watching Kitty and Kay grow up, and grow as people, would be a good story arc for both of them.<br><br>But going on missions as they are?<br><br>Sorry, cob. Can&#39;t see it.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m pretty sure that it&#39;s stated in one of the books (a cursory Google search tells me <i>the Goblet of Fire</i>) that Muggle technology does not work on Hogwarts grounds. While I can&#39;t quite remember if this has ever been demonstrated in canon, Hermione was the source. I&#39;d say she&#39;s pretty reliable. Canonically, technology malfunctions when exposed to magic, which Hogwarts is practically swimming in.<br><br>That said, I know that <i>PPC</i> tech works on Hogwarts grounds, so perhaps DoSAT figured out some sort of work-around. (Has that ever been explained in-universe? I&#39;ve not read a lot of Harry Potter missions, so I am not certain.)</p>

            <p>Hermione stated that electricity and some examples of technology (which all use electricity) don’t work at Hogwarts, because the concentration of magic is so very high there. Young folks these days tend to forget that awesome technology like crossbows, windmills, clockworks, steam engines and chemical photography exist, don’t use electricity, and apparently don’t malfunction when exposed to large amounts of magic. I’m not sure whether steampunk applications of electricity would work at Hogwarts; judging from context, Hermione talked mostly about electronics.<br><br>Sci-Fi technology may work at Hogwarts if we suppose that a sufficiently advanced substitute for electricity will be invented in the future. Most potterverse-missions apparently ignore the problem, but it has actually been handled both ways:<br><br><a href="http://the-ppc.livejournal.com/39098.html">The CAD works because a <i>Sombody Else’s Problem Field</i>  shields it from the magic.</a><br><br><a href="https://rc170.wordpress.com/2011/10/30/the-making-of-a-queen-aka-the-raison-detre/">The neuralyzer obviously cannot work at Hogwarts because it is ripped of a technology-heavy continuum and thus not sufficiently undefined magitech.</a><a><br><br>Personally, I believe that PPC technology at Hogwarts works like bleeprin – as long as the agents don’t think about recharging the batteries (read: whenever not working, rather than being funny, would distract from the other fun).<br><br>HG</a></p>

            <p>Hi people of the board.<br>I&#39;m a newbie and even though I haven&#39;t given an introduction yet I have an extremely important request.<br>So, have any of you heard of Wattpad?<br>Good, a few of you have. For those who don&#39;t know it&#39;s kind of like fanfiction.net except you can write anything and not just fan-fiction.<br>Now for my request. <br>I really want someone to sort out the Wattpad story &#39;After&#39;. It&#39;s a fanfic about a badboy style Harry Styles (from 1Direction) who goes after (see what I did there?) the MC Tessa Young. It&#39;s a horribly written story and involves anger (EXPLICIT!) s*x. Those scenes are horrible and leave a bad taste in the mouth. It&#39;s the most infamous book on Wattpad.<br>Please please please can an agent sort this out? And if it&#39;s already been done can someone link me to it?<br>Thanks.</p>

The PPC hasn&#39;t really done Real Person Fic for some time now, I&#39;m afraid; it is, after all, more than a little invasive. As much as the thought of a Harry Styles replacement being repeatedly stabbed in the gizzards by an overweight clown fills me with delight, it&#39;s just... not something we do. Sorry.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the Nuzleaf and Ghost Baby!<br>Yeah, I was kind of thinking that a real person fic wouldn&#39;t be sporked. But if it makes any difference the supposed &#39;Harry Styles&#39; is so OOC it might as well be someone else. And I just called Harry Stules an it.<br><br>Also, is there anyway to request a doc to get sporked? Do you just post on the board requesting for one? Or is there a specific place to put it?</p>

            <p>People mission stuff because it rustles their jimmies, or they think they can write a funny story, or because they have something special in mind. The PPC isn&#39;t a spork factory, it&#39;s a bunch of people who like each other&#39;s company and have this thing about writing. Pretty simple, actually.</p>

            <p>I found the PPC when I mentioned on another forum that I was going to take the plunge and read My Immortal.(I haven&#39;t finished it yet. I don&#39;t think I want to)<br>And I&#39;m one of those people who can easily understand things when they aren&#39;t so coherent.

            <p>Hey there, and welcome aBoard! For your newbie gift, take this whistling llama! If the urple bow around its neck becomes too much, feel free to remove it.<br><br>Care to tell us a little about yourself? Fandoms, perhaps? I&#39;m a huge <i>Harry Potter</i> nerd myself, so if you ever need an obscure fact checked, I&#39;m your girl!<br><br>So, I&#39;d like to take this opportunity to point you in the direction of the Original Series and the Constitution, since those are the only required reading around here, but I&#39;ll also point you towards Neshomeh&#39;s spin-offs because they&#39;re Just That Good. ;)<br><br>Hope you like it here!</p>

Are you sure Rudi’s was the best idea? I know that I was kinda punch-drunk, but this is still a <i>bar.</i>”<br> <br>Kala, whose anatomy didn’t allow her to sit, simply settled herself opposite to Valon and grinned wickedly. “I could convince you further. Besides, bars aren’t just places to get drunk, despite what you said the first time we came here. There’s food, there’s soda, and right now there’s you and me.”<br> <br>“I guess that’s a point.” Valon picked up his menu and started perusing the contents.</p>

I recall you both now - reading your after-action reports has been an education, and I believe you need this more than I do myself.&quot; The barman appeared with another glass, this one much smaller; the Earl still only poured a half-measure. &quot;It is most potent. After much experimentation, it was determined that earlier attempts were too potent, which has been of no comfort to the cleaning staff who have to remove the strange stains that are sometimes black and sometimes... not.

            <p>&quot;He&#39;s over there. You can spot the poor sod a mile off once you know what a powdered wig looks like. Come on.&quot;<br><br>Algie muttered something in what was probably Aramaic, if you heard things backwards from the other end of a bad phone line, as he was gently loaded onto a sack barrow and strapped in place. Normally a rather ruddily-complexioned man, his colour did not seem to be returning, and his eyes were glassy and unfocused.<br><br>&quot;Algie? Algie, look at me.&quot; The woman in charge - and in a DIA uniform, though with an odd pentagonal flashpatch just above the department&#39;s own. &quot;Have you been at it again?&quot;<br><br>&quot;♀ìÑM½»┴♣?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Well, he&#39;s not conjuring pictures in the air with his breath any more. Right. You boys have a drink on me, I&#39;ll cart his Lordship back to the High Meggers.&quot; The two other agents, who&#39;d been expecting more of a fight, put down their stun guns and the mop they&#39;d really hoped not to have to use and grabbed a pint of something bubbly and intimidating.<br><br>&quot;... Ghf? ghfnibbit?&quot;<br><br>McCandless smiled a little as she wheeled him out of the bar. &quot;Coming back to Earth, your Lordship? Or as good as makes no difference?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yrrvl. Vlr. Ah.&quot;<br><br>&quot;This is faster than normal. And we didn&#39;t have to clear anyone up! Makes a change for the lads, I tell you.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Arrrh.&quot; The Earl&#39;s eyes finally seemed to focus, though he was still whiter than a sheet in a snowstorm. &quot;Arhm. HMY... My lady? My lady...&quot;<br><br>&quot;Sorry, Algie,&quot; said the Commander with a sad smile, &quot;bit late to be calling me a Lady.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Rrr.&quot; He shook his head. &quot;I... I was so <i>sure</i>... d-mn!&quot; Algie slammed his head back against the sack barrow&#39;s handle. &quot;D-mn it all, I&#39;ve been an <i>imbecile</i>!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Nah. Only to one woman, anyway. You&#39;ve got to stop chatting pretty girls up at dive bars, you know, &#39;cause most of &#39;em could snap you like a twig.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I fear it is the only twiglike thing about me these days. I believe I am able to walk from here, Commander, if I may.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Okay, cob.&quot; McCandless undid the straps and let him out. &quot;Didn&#39;t spill much, either, usually it goes all over the shop when you get the dosage wrong.&quot;<br><br>&quot;That would be because I did not! I am a fool!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Not disagreeing with you, your Lordship, but, well...&quot; McCandless pointed at the sack barrow.<br><br>&quot;Yes, well, that would normally be inarguable. But! I did not bid the barman use our normal testing glasses - I was so, I was so sure of my success that I bade him use the gold-rimmed ones, a gift from the Duke of Cambridge upon the occasion of my... my w-wife&#39;s birth. And they cannot have been properly sterilised. And, and so I went to the Live Specimens Division to tell Lilianna of my success. When I arrived I was told there was still a lecture going on, and upon ignoring this fact...&quot;<br><br>Algie could go no further, and crumpled slightly, his hands clasped over his face as if in prayer. McCandless put her hand upon his shoulder.<br><br>&quot;Thank you,&quot; he continued. &quot;Still. I should have been more careful. While this has given us some valuable data about Bleeport&#39;s reactions to conventional alcohol, I fear we ought not to investigate further.&quot;<br><br>&quot;D&#39;you want to go back?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I think I ought. If nothing else, I must apologise to the poor souls I so embarrassed myself in front of. Now, let&#39;s see...&quot; Algie thought for a moment. &quot;Rina and... Zip? Zeb! Yes. Odd names, but this organization is a great tapestry of oddments.&quot;<br><br>&quot;You&#39;re not wrong, cob. Don&#39;t stay out too late, now, you&#39;ve got your magic show in the Nursery tomorrow.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Well, if I might be permitted to ask your accompaniment...?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Why, my Lord Wymbourne, I would be delighted. Come on then, posho, you&#39;re buying.&quot;<br><br>&quot;A gentleman would never dream of making a lady in his company pay when he has the means to avoid it.&quot; The two agents trotted along through the corridors, Algie trying gamely to match the Commander&#39;s easy, bouncing gait. &quot;I must wash my mouth out with something, at any rate. Contaminated Bleeport is not the only thing which may leave a foul taste.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Forensic fancy another chat with the departed?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Worse. Intelligence required me to scry a Word World whose occupants they intend to render unto Bad Slash. That poor little boy... dressing him such, inflicting a cavalcade of indignities upon his form, it is shameful-&quot;<br><br>&quot;Easy now, cob. Remember what happened the last time you got excitable after a Bleeport comedown?&quot;<br><br>&quot;And I apologised to the dwarfish gentleman in question, and he was most gracious to me. Mrs. Hunnicombe informed me later that blood is much easier to get out with modern washing aids. Truly these are enlightened times - ah! And we arrive.&quot; Algie held the door open. &quot;Commander?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Thank you. Forgive me not curtseying.&quot;<br><br>&quot;You&#39;re an officer and an army cove, Commander; society excuses you from some social graces.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Oh, does it?&quot; McCandless grinned as she dug him in the ribs. &quot;See if I use the comfy barrow next time.&quot;<br><br>&quot;A port, Sir, and a...&quot; Algie looked to McCandless as they sat down. &quot;I am to say something embarrassingly lewd in a short time. I can feel it in my water.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Hmmm...&quot; The muscular woman made a show of choosing something. &quot;That one, I think.&quot;<br><br>Algie&#39;s face fell. &quot;And a Screaming Orgasm for my partner.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I thought you was a married man, Mister Wymbourne,&quot; said the barman with a smile that threatened to cut off the top of his head.<br><br>&quot;Which is why you must deliver it to Commander McCandless, and not myself,&quot; Algie replied mildly as the drinks arrived. &quot;To England, wherever she may be?&quot;<br><br>&quot;To England,&quot; replied Lola, clinking her glass. And then, meaning something else, &quot;and to wherever she may be.&quot;</p>

            <p>Two women and a man paused upon entering the bar. <br><br>&quot;Y&#39;see him anywhere, Liese?&quot; one of the women said in a Scottish accent. She mumbled something inaudible through the short tusks protruding from beneath her lower lip as she rubbed the back of her neck. &quot;Please say no, so I can go back to my RC and sleep. I&#39;ve been runnin&#39; ragged thanks to all these flippin&#39; modern AUs.&quot;<br><br>The man gave her a sour look before scanning the room. &quot;There.&quot; He pointed at the two men huddled together. &quot;I believe that is who we came to see.&quot;<br><br>&quot;&#39;Believe&#39; is a long way from &#39;know.&#39;&quot;<br><br>Liese folded his arms into the sleeves of his black robes. &quot;He fits the description, from what I can tell.&quot; <br><br>The second woman said nothing as she looked over at the bar itself.

            <p>&quot;Liese Aulvenic, Department of Temporal Offenses. The Historical Inaccuracies Division, to be precise.&quot; He glanced over at his companions. &quot;This is Dona Carruthers—” <br><br>The stocky woman with the tusks gave a quick and sloppy salute. &quot;Call me Deegee,&quot; she said.<br><br>&quot;—and that is Agent Hazel behind her,&quot; Liese continued. The thin woman peeked out from behind Deegee&#39;s shoulder, but only for a moment. She then ducked back down again. &quot;They are both with the Department of Improbable AUs.&quot;<br><br>&quot;We were wonderin&#39; if you could spare a bit of time to gab with us,&quot; Deegee said. &quot;You&#39;ve apparently had a few interesting encounters with, ah… visitors.&quot;</p>

            <p>&quot;Take a seat,&quot; he said, sweeping an arm towards the empty barstools to his right. &quot;Just one thing though. This place? Y&#39;know, HQ? It&#39;s a melting pot of timelines. What&#39;s true for one agent&#39;s future from <i>my</i> perspective isn&#39;t true from <i>theirs</i>. A lot of other people were with me when the &#39;visitors&#39; came. Why don&#39;t you ask them? I&#39;m only important in one of the zillion timelines that originate from that moment. <br><br>&quot;But if you&#39;re here because <i>I&#39;m</i> the only one who knows... well, then you have to understand why this must be kept a secret. I must make sure the chessboard is ready: place my pieces and whatnot before my opponent. I can&#39;t risk contaminating my timeline with external influence. I can&#39;t let the Toffee Tree or the Antigravity Apple mess with what I&#39;ve managed to put together.&quot;<br><br>Harris rubbed his head. &quot;You lost me at the perspective thing. Do you <i>always</i> think like this?&quot;</p>

            <p>&quot;Just the fact that you compared this to a chess game shows how little you actually understand,&quot; he said. &quot;You cannot—” <br><br>&quot;What my dickish Jedi friend <i>means</i> is that this sort of alternate timeline stuff is never as simple as you think,&quot; Deegee quickly interrupted. She and Liese briefly exchanged a silent glare before she continued. &quot;Even we don&#39;t really understand it. Cornelius does, but he&#39;s a bit preoccupied at the moment.&quot;<br><br>She took the offered barstool. Hazel glanced at the one next to Deegee&#39;s for a moment before kneeling down and crawling under the bar instead. Liese remained standing, his face twisted in irritation. <br><br>&quot;Look,&quot; Deegee said. &quot;It&#39;s helpful to think that you can prepare for whatever it is that&#39;s comin&#39;. I get that. But alternate realities don&#39;t work like that. The very act of preparin&#39; is enough to cause things to change, meanin&#39; that the situation you&#39;re tryin&#39; to get ready for isn&#39;t the situation you&#39;ll get. It&#39;s all very quantum.&quot;<br><br>&quot;In any event,&quot; Liese finally said, &quot;we are here for information, not to stop you. We want to know the details of your encounter along with anything you might now about that future in question.&quot;</p>

            <p>&quot;Sorry.&quot; Gaspard folded his arms on the counter. &quot;See, this is exactly the thing that I was warned of. The... &#39;bad future&#39; happens specifically because someone reported the visitors to the Flowers. The Board of Department Heads then tried to take preventive measures but only managed to breed a more insidious form of the thing they were trying to head off.&quot; Turning to Liese, he said: &quot;And of course I know that things change! For example, right now I count two-and-a-half more Time Lords than mentioned in the information that I received. Harris here now has a girlfriend--&quot;<br><br>&quot;Sonia is <i>not</i> my girlfriend,&quot; interrupted Harris.<br><br>&#39;Yes she is,&quot; continued Gaspard, &quot;and finally New Caledonia now has a central building thing. The situation has changed-- I&#39;m aware of that. I just ask that you give me the space that  I need to complete this operation. I&#39;m under strict orders not to divulge this information to just anyone lest <i>my</i> history repeats itself.&quot;<br><br>&quot;But how did they find you?&quot; said Harris. &quot;From <i>their</i> perspective maybe one of the others talked. Then they went on to question <i>you</i>.&quot;<br><br>&quot;So... does that mean we&#39;re already on track for the DTOM timeline?&quot; said Gaspard, rubbing his chin. &quot;Aw, heck. This is going to suck.&quot;<br><br>&quot;No, not necessarily,&quot; said Harris. &quot;Maybe we&#39;re in a <i>different</i> timeline. Like, one separate from ours and the DTOM&#39;s.&quot;<br><br>Gaspard scratched his head. &quot;Maybe. Um, timeline specialist people? What do you think? I can&#39;t possibly say anything to you guys because that constitutes &#39;treason&#39; from my perspective and I don&#39;t want to risk my efforts going to waste. On the other hand... maybe in this timeline informing the Flowers won&#39;t be so bad.&quot;<br><br>- - -<br><br>((For sanity&#39;s sake let&#39;s say this doesn&#39;t impact Triple Prime.))</p>

            <p>&quot;What makes you think the Flowers don&#39;t already know?&quot; she asked. &quot;I mean, in a general sense. We didn&#39;t exactly come down here for a pint and a bit of chatter with you and, ah, your lucky ladies man there.&quot; The ork paused. &quot;Actually, that&#39;s not a bad idea. Rudi, could you fix us up with a pint of ale please?&quot;<br><br>There was a plaintive grunt from underneath the bar.<br><br>&quot;Right, sorry. A pint and a sundae, please!&quot;<br><br>Liese sighed as Deegee turned her attention to the man standing at the opposite end of the bar. &quot;There have been an increasing number of trans-temporal and trans-dimensional visitors in the PPC in recent years,&quot; he said. &quot;We are attempting to catalogue these encounters and analyze the possibility of any risk to this organization. This is rather beyond just being about you.&quot; <br><br>&quot;Be nice, Liese,&quot; Deegee warned from over her shoulder.<br><br>He continued on, ignoring the DIAU agent. &quot;As for your concerns about what timeline we happen to be in, I&#39;m afraid I have no comforting words to give you.

            <p>&quot;And dread. Mostly dread.&quot; Gaspard drummed his fingers on the table. &quot;All right. To heck with this. I need help anyways.&quot; He looked at Harris, who shrugged. &quot;Right. So, from the top. The visitors were known as Paladins. They came from sometime after 2060 where the PPC had been shattered into a multitude of smaller department-things spread over the multiverse. There was a civil war-- the Sundering-- where the Sub Rosa&#39;s Loyalists fought against the Department of Efficiency and Author Correction. The Loyalists won but at a great cost: all of the Flowers but the Sub Rosa perished and HQ was shattered by an invasion of monsters caused by dropping the shields. The thing I was trying to prevent was a grimdark version of the Sundering. But since you guys are here and this doesn&#39;t seem to be <i>my</i> timeline... well, things are different. The Board of Department Heads could block the Efficient <i>and</i> the sneakier Department of Time, Order, and Motion with enough foresight. Yes... yes, that might work.&quot;<br><br>Harris coughed. &quot;Mansfield. Mansfield from Personnel is who you want to stop. He&#39;s the one that will lead DTOM to power.&quot;<br><br>Gaspard eyed the agents. &quot;Any what are you guys going to do with this information anyways? Report it straight away to the Flowers?&quot;</p>

            <p>&quot;The Sundering. Great. Always good for a laugh, that is.&quot; <br><br>Liese stroked his pointed grey beard. &quot;It sounds like the Paladins could have come from either DF-109C or 109D. Or possibly some new permutation thereof. Let me see...&quot; He pulled out a tablet and began tapping away at the screen while muttering to himself, the other agents seemingly forgotten. <br><br>The ork reached out and intercepted a frothing glass of ale and a surprisingly ornate vanilla sundae as they came sliding down the bar. &quot;We&#39;ve heard of Mansfield,&quot; she said as she handed the sundae down underneath her seat. There was a happy growl from floor level. &quot;His name&#39;s popped up in our research multiple times. Usually not for positive reasons.&quot; She tipped back her ale. &quot;Same with those two departments you mentioned, although I&#39;m not as familiar with the Time, Order, and Motion one. As for the Flowers—” <br><br>&quot;That is our business,&quot; Liese cut in without looking away from his tablet.<br><br>&quot;Come off it, Liese!&quot;<br><br>&quot;I will do no such thing, Dona. You are well aware of the rules surrounding what it is that we do.&quot;<br><br>&quot;It&#39;s not going to kill them to know a little bit!&quot;<br><br>The Jedi finally glanced up at the seething DIAU agent. &quot;You are welcome to try, but don&#39;t don&#39;t be surprised if you find yourself tongue-tied.&quot; He turned his attention back to Gaspard and Harris as Deegee shot him the V-sign. &quot;I have two questions. Did these Paladins mention a third group in this version of the Sundering? And does &quot;The Centurion&quot; mean anything to you in the context of this future?&quot;</p>

            <p>Harris leaned past his colleague to look at Liese. &quot;I feel obligated to add that in the DTOM timeline there were organized Mary Sue invasions of HQ.

            <p>&quot;I am speaking of a third faction within the PPC itself, fighting against both the Loyalists and the Efficient. This Centurion is tied to it.

            <p>&quot;I can&#39;t really think of anything else, really,&quot; said Gaspard. &quot;Er, aside from the fact that I&#39;m supposed to be the only one who remembers <i>anything</i>. Two agents from the DTOM timeline came from one of the futures and wiped everyone&#39;s memories but mine. They told me that since I was to become the General it would be better for me to have twenty-odd years to plan ahead for a cleaner Sundering. Well, insamuch as a civil war that will tear HQ apart will be &#39;clean&#39;. It gets really bad: think nuclear-blast-in-the-Courtyard kind of bad.&quot;<br><br>Harris&#39; brow furrowed. &quot;Wait. Since when did we have <i>nuclear bombs</i> in the PPC?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Well, it wasn&#39;t a bomb per se. It was actually the engine of an old DoSAT starship rigged to explode. The Loyalists were desperate. They needed a win so they started throwing whatever they had at the DTOM.&quot; Gaspard grimaced. &quot;I can&#39;t believe Other Me actually condoned this.

            <p>...to the Jolteon. <i>&quot;No, I&#39;m not. An who you might be? And who is this &#39;Owen&#39; for that matter?&quot;</i><br><br>&quot;Owen is the Lucario from the Courtyard,&quot; replied the Nurse, who then turned to the newly arrived waiter. &quot;Oh! Thank you for coming. A <i>vodka</i> for me, a... Jasmine tea? --Shui-Hua nodded in agreement-- Yes, a jasmine tea for the Technician, and a Oran Berry Juice for the Gardevoir.&quot;<br><br>Maya, who was thoughtful during that, finally telepathically spoke, <i>&quot;Oh! Now I remember. Miss Corinna, he had reminded me of someone else...&quot;</i><br><br>&quot;Do not mention him. It took me a long time to leave behind the night--&quot; Corinna notices the Skiddo and kneels next to him to get a closer look. &quot;This is interesting. I have never seen one of your kind before.&quot;<br><br>Shui-Hua, meanwhile, feeling a little uncomfortable with all of this, noticed Tacitus&#39; note, and whispered to him, &quot;Yeah I think so, and speaking of clichés, ever heard of The Third Wheel? Yeah, I feel like that right now.&quot;</p>

            <p><a href="http://localhost:3000/posts/scrape/2015/www.rgb.thecomicseries.com/comics/1/">This</a> is a webcomic that&#39;s absolutely breathtaking. The colors are stunning, the plot&#39;s amazing, and the characters are so 3-dimensional that you could almost reach out and touch them. It&#39;s called &#39;The Property of Hate&#39;, but don&#39;t let the odd title deter you. When I started reading it, I thought that it was very in spirit with some of the PPC concepts. <br>I... really can&#39;t say any more about it. Except that Hero is adorable and so is RGB, in a way.<br><br>Just go read it!</p>

            <p>Truly, I am. This comic is delightful. I spent a couple hours last night reading it straight through to the most recent page and don&#39;t regret it one bit. The characters and world it presents are so pretty and so imaginative. I feel a distinct similarity <i>Peter Pan</i> or <i> Alice in Wonderland</i>, both of which I adore. I love it.<br><br>It should be noted though, that the link you gave us is outdated. The comic, along with a number of other assorted works by the same author, is currently hosted <a href="http://thepropertyofhate.com/">here</a><a>. I&#39;d recommend anyone who enjoyed this comic take a look at her other stuff because all of it is wonderful (even if much of it is still unfinished).</a></p>

            <p>What is the PPC&#39;s stance on the variations of World 1 canons as written in other &#39;verses? I&#39;d be surprised if the Mystverse version of Tony Hillerman hadn&#39;t mentioned the Amad (Atrus&#39; mother&#39;s people, whose historical territory would not have been that far from that of the Navajo) at least once in his detective fiction. Also, in the Whoniverse version of <i>Star Trek</i>, &quot;Specter of the Gun&quot; would be different because the writer of &quot;The Gunfighters&quot; made a number of historical mistakes.</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve been trying to come up with other examples.  One interesting situation I thought of involves <i>Fahrenheit 451</i>.  Would it still exist in Thursday Next&#39;s version of Earth?  After all, our version of Ray Bradbury wrote it in response to his observation that people were becoming less attentive and thoughtful, surely not a danger in Next&#39;s book-obsessed culture.  So would the Nextian Bradbury still write it at all?  Would it come about as alternate history horror, instead of the speculative science fiction it was in our world?<br><br>I don&#39;t know if such alternate publications would be useful to the PPC, but it could be fun to rewrite a short section of such a book to see what it might look like!</p>

            <p>It&#39;s also extremely vague. The line put me in mind of clickbait article titles: &quot;An exiled swordsman faces many forms of darkness and secrets that will change his life and the world forever. Find out what those secrets were here!&quot;<br><br>Also, I&#39;m a little unclear as to what you mean by &quot;hookline.&quot; I associate hooks in writing with a line or section at the very beginning of the story that draws the reader in. Something that makes them want to read. What you seem to be looking for is a one-line summation. If that is the case, then you actually need to say something about the plot. Something like:<br>&quot;Zaahira Kazemi, a young woman with a college degree struggling to find a job, becomes a henchman for a costumed criminal.&quot;<br>or<br>&quot;A foppish layabout from a wealthy family stumbles upon a conspiracy involving smuggled dwarven weapons and mage-hunters.&quot;<br>There&#39;s got to be some meat on those bones, if you follow me.<br><br>PC</p>

            <p>The first things that springs to mind is &#39;that&#39;s cliché, how is this book any different than any other fantasy book?&#39; Unfortunately, I can&#39;t offer anything positive without knowing anything about the book.</p>
