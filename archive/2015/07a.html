            <p>The interactions of Rina and Valon were particularly enjoyable. And that fic... *shudders* One thing: The author notes dividing the bulk of the story from the TARDIS followup threw me off. I wasn&#39;t sure for a moment if the story ended there or somehow went on to another mission. I read this on my phone, though, so it might have just messed up and changed the order somehow. On the whole, fun and enjoyable mission! </p>

            <p>Seriously, what the heck <i>was</i> that thing? At least Valon (temporarily) got a TARDIS out of it :)<br><br>One question: Is the part where Valon meets that TARDIS supposed to be like an end-credits scene?

            <p>But I wonder how Valon got the power of knowing when Kala understands him.<br><i>The girtablilu took a bit to figure out what he was getting at. When she understood, though, <b>he</b> smiled.</i><br>Or it is a typo and you meant &quot;she smiled&quot;.<br><br>Krautpicking:<br>1) I’ve never heard a German use &quot;<i>Blut</i>&quot; in swearing; this is probably a bloody Yankees’ habit.<br>&quot;<i>ScheiЯe!</i> We forgot the TARDIS!” would work better.<br>2) We have the weird habit of capitalizing all nouns, not just proper nouns. If Valon has a good reason to swear by shit and blood, &quot;<i>Blut</i>&quot; should be capitalized.<br>3) I feel that &quot;<i>Blut und  ScheiЯe</i>&quot; sounds better, although still weird. I have no rational explanation for this, it’s either &quot;put the longer word at the end&quot;, or &quot;progress from unpleasant to repugnant&quot;, maybe both. <br><br>HG</p>

            <p><i>&quot;No tienes razуn.&quot;</i> usually is used as &quot;You&#39;re wrong,&quot; but can also be used as meaning &quot;You&#39;re insane,&quot; in the sense of &quot;You&#39;re not right,&quot; yes.

            <p>Which is to say, I might be needing beta services soon. But, let&#39;s worry about that when the time comes.<br><br>I&#39;ve been writing a few short Trek fics surrounding the most dysfunctional crew of all time, who ride around in a powerful prototype warship that malfunctions more often than most PPC equipment. It&#39;s definitely a comedy, as I felt Trek was getting a little dark. The fics are also a good way for me to try out a new episodic format. I&#39;m used to writing large epics, so if anyone has any tips for me on how to write episodically, I&#39;ll gladly take them! By the way, this is why I haven&#39;t been terribly active lately. Well, this and the fact that my internet connection has been finicky due to all the thunder storms.</p>

            <p>&quot;At First&quot; meaning that these guys won&#39;t pass up many opportunities to get home, due to barely being Starfleet officers. But, assuming they get home before reaching the Bajoran Wormhole, yes, there is a fairly high chance they&#39;ll interact with the Enterprise. The comedy style is actually very similar to the PPC, in the sense of malfunctioning equipment, insane crew, possibly-sentient computer that runs windows 9000.</p>

            <p>A reliable Doctor Who source (link below) says in the article on the Time Lord species that &quot;all thirteen&quot; incarnations of the Doctor put the other Time Lords in another dimension for…something… I don&#39;t know what yet. But, once he was about to die for good, they granted him a new cycle of regenerations, another round of thirteen forms. Thus, a Time Lord can only have thirteen forms. It&#39;s most likely that the new forms are the ones the audience sees him in. So, operating on that theory, it makes sense that once the 13th Doctor dies, he dies for good, without regenerating, if canon is to be followed.<br><br><a href="http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Time_Lord"><a href="http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Time_Lord">http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Time_Lord</a></a></p>

That means that:<br><br>-Series 8, and the upcoming Series 9, cover the Twelfth Doctor (the current incarnation). He is the first incarnation of the new set. So he has a full set of regenerations available.<br><br>Or, if you prefer: &#39;Just repeat to yourself, &quot;It&#39;s just the show/I should really just relax...!&quot;&#39;<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I know a lot of people didn&#39;t like Twelve due to his abrasive manner, but I think that&#39;s part of <i>why</i> I like him. Maybe it&#39;s because I write multiple Won&#39;t Put Up With That Nonsense characters myself? Anyway, this paragraph is just for spoiler protection, in case people see it on the preview. Is this enough text? It&#39;d better be.<br><br>So: that was definitely Skaro, or at least a Dalek planet. Saw This And Thought Of Exterminate. <sup>_^</sup> Hopefully they&#39;ll be better handled than Rusty The Good Dalek.<br><br>Zygons are goofy-looking. ;) But shapeshifters do make for good monsters.<br><br>I wasn&#39;t counting, but there&#39;s at least two new monsters (apparently) in the trailer - the ghost-things and the welders. Ghost-things looked like another Moffatt &#39;here is a common fear MADE REAL&#39; episode (see: Silence in the Library, Blink, Listen, multiple others); I&#39;m not sure what the fear would <i>be</i>, but that was the vibe I got.<br><br>And the newcomer. Heh, given who every other Mysterious Character has been, is there any chance she&#39;s Missy again? <sup>_^</sup> I&#39;d love her to be Susan (which might make the Dalek planet, um... Earth!), but I&#39;m going to place an off-the-wall bet: Leela. Hey, she stayed on Gallifrey, didn&#39;t she? And the tone comes across as fairly classic Leela.<br><br>(She won&#39;t be Leela.)<br><br>September 19th is only two months away. <sup>_<sup><br><br>hS</sup></sup></p>

            <p>I apologize for the double post, but there was no other thread to put this on.<br><br>So I found a fic. It&#39;s an utterly stupid crossover between Doctor Who and Mario, that&#39;s only about 500 words in length.<br><br>It features Davros and the Daleks, all of whom have been replaced.<br><br>There are only four Doctor Who experts currently active in the PPC; unfortunately, all are Time Lords who probably wouldn&#39;t mix well with Daleks.<br><br>Rina has her own problems, I have plans with the Librarian, I just did a cowrite with Dawn not too long ago (no Reader), and I think we can all agree that the Notary would be a nightmare for all parties involved.<br><br>I guess <i>technically</i> there&#39;s Morgan, since hS is still active, but... honestly? I&#39;m kinda scared of working with the real oldbies. I don&#39;t know if my writing style (fluffy, lighthearted and generally happy) would mesh with that of, for instance, hS.<br><br>I&#39;d <i>love</i> to work with Fish Custard, because the Fisherman is one of my favorite PPC characters, but alas, he seems to have faded into oblivion.<br><br>Does anyone else have Action agents familiar with Doctor Who, Time Lord or not? It&#39;s a short fic, but I&#39;m not an expert in the field.<br><br>The fic is <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11240368/1/Mimi-of-the-Daleks">here</a>, by the way.</p>

            <p>We&#39;ve already got humanized Dalek agents, at least one of which is yours, IIRC. What do you need with another one, and a canon character at that?<br><br>Just a reminder to all and sundry: recruiting canon characters, even ones that died in canon, is discouraged if not outright banned. It&#39;s one of those things that, while it did happen in the past, was generally agreed to have been a bad idea, even by some of the people that did it. I distinctly remember Chatvert expressing regrets about Team Phoenix, for one. The PPC is supposed to be preserving canon, not tinkering with it, which kinda means that dead people should stay dead.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>If you really can&#39;t think of an original character from that setting, cobble together an Obvious Expy of the relevant canon character and say they&#39;re from a badfic. There&#39;s always comedy to be milked from that - or drama, in one of my own agents&#39; cases. Poor Lilianna.

            <p>As someone who&#39;s got WAY too many agents (and who may or may not be writing out one of my teams soon, shhh!), I can say with confidence that there IS such a thing as too many good ideas.<br><br>Now, I&#39;m not a Dr. Who fan, but I know that it would be interesting to recruit a species considered canonically evil, even if I agree with the discussion on the Shroobs below that there&#39;s a limit to that. But I&#39;ve learned the hard way that too much of a good thing can lead to bad outcomes - like trying to control too many things, for a start. This gets doubly problematic with regards to recruiting canon characters - Sarah&#39;s a replacement of a bit character at best. The closest we&#39;d have to recruited canons is recruited canon REPLACEMENTS, which is a pretty big difference.<br><br>So, well, if you do have a humanized Dalek already, and if he&#39;s suitable for Action Department mission stuff, I&#39;d say just use him. It can&#39;t hurt, can&#39;t it? :)</p>

            <p>There&#39;s a way to stop regeneration. Certain ways prevent it entirely, and you may have noticed agents on DW missions shooting Time Lord Sues twice. As far as I currently remember, if a Time Lord is killed mid-regeneration, it&#39;s permanent. Something like that.<br><br>But yeah, as the Boarder below me who I really need a nickname for said, it gets explained later on in the series.<br><br>~DF<br><br>PS: [EvilAI]UBEROverlord, do you have a particular preferred nickname?

            <p>I&#39;m terribly confused. Some are arguing that since John Hurt&#39;s Doctor was actually called a Doctor in the 50th Anniversary (which I know nothing about except that a whole bunch of Doctors get together in one place), then he /should/ be the Eighth Doctor, and the whole list might have to be renumbered.<br><br>So, does he count or not? And why &quot;The War Doctor&quot;? Was he more bloodthirsty than his fellow versions?</p>

            <p>You said you&#39;d seen most of the &#39;05 series, right? So you&#39;ve heard of the Last Great Time War? I&#39;m pretty sure the Gelth mention it way back in <i>The Unquiet Dead</i>, and I&#39;m nearly certain it comes up in <i>Dalek</i>.<br><br>Anyway, short answer: &#39;the War Doctor&#39; is a term we use for the incarnation of the Doctor who was around during the (latter part of the) Time War. He <i>was</i> more warlike than his pre- and post-decessors, as a deliberate choice (he decided to take part in the Time War, rather than stay on the sidelines). He also specifically rejected the title &#39;Doctor&#39;, though as Some Say, he kind of reclaimed it during the 50th Anniversary (which you should wait to watch in order, for the record).<br><br>So should the numbering be changed? Ehhh... no. <sup>_^</sup> It&#39;s all external anyway - Nine never said &#39;I&#39;m the Ninth Doctor&#39; (or indeed &#39;I&#39;m the Tenth Doctor, but I don&#39;t like to count the last guy, so let&#39;s go with Ninth&#39;); they&#39;re just designations we use so we know which one we&#39;re talking about. And &#39;the War Doctor&#39; is a perfectly acceptable title.<br><br>The production team pretty much settled this when they chose to call the current incarnation Twelve, even though he&#39;s in the thirteenth distinct form the Doctor has taken.<br><br>(Oh, and going back to your original question about the Time War: pretty sure Time Lords can&#39;t regenerate from a Dalek extermination beam. It&#39;d be a pretty shoddy weapon to use against them if they could. <sup>_^</sup> Also they can&#39;t regenerate from being atomised or whatnot.)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I don&#39;t think Ixendelle are trying to claim you need to watch literally every episode of <i>Doctor Who</i> still available before writing fic of it, because that would be pretty silly. You don&#39;t need to watch the First Doctor nearly marry an Aztec priestess in order to write the Ninth fighting banjo-wielding aliens, for instance.<br><br>What you need is to have a clear understanding of how the setting works, and to have all the facts relevant to the story you&#39;re writing. If you want to write about the Seventh Doctor, watch enough of him that you know how he acts. If you want to write about giant insect aliens, find out how many times the Doctor has faced those before (<a href="http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Category:Sentient_insects">it seems to be quite a few</a>). If you want to write a regeneration, find out how those work - preferably by watching some of them, but the Wiki is always useful.<br><br>hS<br><br>PS: I mean, hopefully the opening statement was kind of obvious? Iximaz writes Pokemon while presumably not having watched all 885 episodes of the anime; Desdendelle writes a Time Lord while not having, I suspect, listened to every <i>Doctor Who</i> audiobook; they both write for the PPC while not having read everything ever written about it, because a lot of it is very hard to find! Sometimes simple logic goes a long way. <sup>_~</sup> ~hS</p>

            <p>I would recommend Knights of Sidonia (of course the US Distributor is Netflix so you need an account).  But I think something that is more in line with what I understand about Monster Musume (which admittedly is very little) is Ah! My Goddess.<br><br>There is really nothing not to like about Ah! My Goddess.  Clean and crisp animation, relatable characters, good tone (moments of both lighthearted frivolity and darker themes, always well mixed.), feats of engineering, and just enough action to vary things up.  So I would recommend that.     </p>

            <p>I&#39;m still up for it, although my travel plans have changed somewhat.<br><br>Instead of starting from my flat, I will now be starting from an undisclosed location, and various other travel arrangements will make it super-convenient for me to catch a much earlier train than I need to (while simultaneously making it slightly irritating to get the train that will get me there on time).

They invade the Mushroom World, drain the life force of its inhabitants, and are generally bastard aliens.

            <p>Even if it is not, I do not necessarily see that as a barrier, it just might require some work to explain why a Shroob would want to be a PPC agent.  And as far as I know there are also Dalek members of the PPC.  So I see no reason why they would be categorically barred.  As I said, it might take some work for it to make sense, but I see no reason why it would be impossible to do so.  Merely improbable.</p>

Going with the example of Shroobs: they have zero redeeming qualities. They kill, destroy, and consume. That&#39;s it. A Shroob agent would kill, destroy, and consume. If you change things to make it more &quot;agent-friendly&quot; (making it NOT want to kill, consume,  or destroy), it simply wouldn&#39;t be a Shroob. It, quite honestly, would be a Sue/Stu in the body of a Shroob. Keeping it on a leash or otherwise subservient? No. Not going to work, sorry. The second anything changes, it WILL try to kill, destroy, and consume. It simply wouldn&#39;t be able to carry out a mission according to procedure.&quot;<br><br>Daleks have an in-universe precedent for why they can be compatible with non-Dalek races.

            <p>I still do not think it would be impossible, merely impracticable.  If someone were familiar enough, I think it could theoretically be done.  <br><br>For the Sith example I was playing around with, this is what I came up with.  Sith seek power, Sues appear to have universe altering abilities, this kind of power would be incredibly appealing to a Sith.  Further as to working with others, if the partner were to be framed as a tool or slave even, then the Sith would be willing to work with them, provided it furthered the Sith&#39;s interest, acquiring the power of the Sues.  Then you have a partner agent that can contend with the physical attributes for when the Sith goes off to, well be a Sith, so that he can be redirected.  Of course this is entirely academic since I scrapped that entire pairing, because I frankly did not enjoy writing it.<br><br>The bottom line is, I think it is possible, just it would take a very intricate knowledge of at least one continuum and possibly another.  I was thinking something along the lines of <a href="http://sidonia-no-kishi.wikia.com/wiki/Blood_Nematode"> A Sidonian Blood Nematode</a>.  Of course it would require work to be a viable method, and it would become something different.  </p>

Then, a few days ago someone (who apparently <i>isn&#39;t</i> affiliated with Netflix) released this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xer4VCa5-tg">trailer</a> on Youtube (just a warning, there is a bit freaky imagery of the creepy crawling variety; if that&#39;s not you cup up tea, I&#39;d advise steering clear).<br><br>Just look at that! That&#39;s seriously cool, especially if it&#39;s really entirely fan-made.<br><br>I&#39;ve not read the books since middle school; my memory&#39;s a bit fuzzy on the canon, but I for one am super eager to see how this turns out. Anyone else?</p>

            <p>This should be fun! The Series hasn&#39;t gotten enough attention since it ended, I don&#39;t think. I might just reread them myself. I could definitely use the refresher.<br><br>Oh! And according to the Wikipedia page, there&#39;s also a more recent young adult series called All the Wrong Questions. It is apparently set in the same universe but focuses on the narrator as a kid. That, I think, is going on to my book list right after ASoUE.</p>

I&#39;m sure you&#39;re wondering where I&#39;ve been *or at least those of you who still remember I exist*. Well, it&#39;s kind of a long story, but bottom line: My laptop&#39;s hard drive broke and it took two months to fix. Not the fixing itself, that took about two weeks. It took two months to find a good client to fix her and get the funding needed to do so. But I&#39;m back now and that&#39;s the most important thing!</p>

            <p>However, I&#39;m a little concerned by your reading defences of Biblical history. It seems like you&#39;re only doing this so you can write slightly better arguments against divine creation/intelligent design/whatever buzzword creationists come up with to peddle their religious beliefs in science classes. What I&#39;d say you <i>should</i> be doing is coming into this with an open mind wrt evidence-based scientific inquiry, rather than simply to try and shore up the tenets of your faith.<br><br>Other than that, yay books! Books are good, for the most part. =]</p>

            <p>Don&#39;t read a book that tells you how to argue a case. Find the evidence, if it exists, and go on from there.

            <p>But everything changed when the derpy internet attacked...<br><br>*sigh* In other words, I tried to post an entry briefly describing the books I was reading, and how they aren&#39;t all on how to argue, but that was lost. Basically, the one I&#39;m reading now deals fully in evidence for a Creator, the one I&#39;m reading next says it will attempt to prove Christianity beyond a reasonable doubt, and after that I have stuff by C.S. Lewis, a book on general debating strategy, and the works of various evolutionists. <br><br>To Scapegrace: I&#39;m reading <i>The Canon of the Scripture</i> last, and mostly because SeaTurtle inquired about the reliability of the Bible, making me realize that I am woefully under prepared for that. Also, in regards to open mindedness... Well, I&#39;ve believed in Christianity all of my life, and simply putting that aside will be massively difficult. However, I <i>will</i> look at evidence (and the lack thereof) as objectively as I can. <br><br>In the meantime, the anthropic principle is <i>wicked</i> cool.  </p>

            <p>Are you more inclined towards the Weak Uranithropic Principle - which says simply that we wouldn&#39;t see uranium in the universe if the universe couldn&#39;t contain uranium - or the Strong Uranithropic Principle, which says that we see uranium because the universe was specifically made to contain uranium?<br><br>(That&#39;s the flaw with the anthropic principle, by the way - it tries to demonstrate life is special by assuming life is special. <sup>_<sup>)<br><br>hS</sup></sup></p>

            <p>... Is more that, if the universe couldn&#39;t contain life, no one would care about it, because we wouldn&#39;t be here. Thus, &quot;if any aspects were shifted hardly at all&quot;, we wouldn&#39;t be able to make that observation, which makes this reflection somewhat irrelevant.<br>Some people actually believe that there are many other universes, and this one happened to be able to sustain life by chance, but there is currently no proof for the existence of any other universe besides this one.</p>

            <p>It&#39;s actually hard to come up with any conceivable experiment to look for the existence of universes that don&#39;t interact with ours in any way... heck, we have a hard enough time with the &#39;cold, dark matter&#39; which apparently constitutes up to 96% of our <i>own</i> universe.<br><br>But that &#39;any aspects shifted&#39;/&#39;sustain life by chance&#39; idea is a little bit wrong. Yes, if the fundamental constants of the universe were different, we wouldn&#39;t see <i>this universe</i>... but that&#39;s like saying &#39;2+3=5! If either 2 or 3 was changed, they <b>wouldn&#39;t be able to equal 5 any more!</b>&#39;<br><br>In fact, it&#39;s a lot like that. There are two big holes in the idea:<br><br>1/ What makes 5 so special? If 3 turned into 4, you wouldn&#39;t make 5 - but you&#39;d make 6, and that 6 would no doubt come up with a Weak Sixthropic Principle which claims that the universe was fine-tuned to make 6. The life we have now (or even the uranium we have now - why&#39;re we focussing on life when there&#39;s far more of other stuff? If the universe is balanced for anything, it&#39;s hydrogen and dark matter!) is hardly the only setup that an infinite number of universes could possible contain. Bind electrons more tightly to their atoms, and you could create life based on covalent bonds between metals.<br><br>2/ 2+3=5... but so does 1+4. You can &#39;compensate&#39; for shifting one constant by shifting another to match. There&#39;s a lot more options for &#39;universe containing life&#39; than you might think.<br><br>3/ Did I say two? I meant three. <sup>_^</sup> The third is error bars. I rounded the actual values of 2.10526, 3.33983, and 5.44509 to get that lovely neat 2+3=5. Any values that round to 5 would&#39;ve worked. Similarly, the &#39;fine tuning&#39; of the universe is rather more coarse than you might imagine - the figures could vary by a long way and still give substantially the same universe.<br><br>There&#39;s a lovely example of this in one of the <i>Science of Discworld</i> books... actually, I think it&#39;s in three of the four, they enjoyed it so much! For your reading pleasure, I&#39;ll now spend twenty minutes copying it out from Google Books:<br><br><hr>
<br><br>&#39;The story of the carbon resonance can be found in many science books, because it creates a powerful impression of hidden order in the universe, and it seems to explain so much. [...]<br><br>&#39;Here&#39;s how the story goes. Carbon [which living cells are based on] is created in red giant stars by a rather delicate process of nuclear synthesis, called the triple-alpha process. This involves the fusion of three helium nuclei. [...]<br><br>&#39;All very well, but the odds of such a triple collision occuring inside a star are very small. Collisions of two helium nuclei are much more common, though still relatively rare. It is extremely rare for a third helium nucleus to crash into two that are just colliding. [...] This means that the synthesis of carbon has to take place in a series of steps rather than all at once, and the obvious way is for two helium nuclei to fuse, and then for a third helium nucleus to fuse with the result.<br><br>&#39;The first step is easy, and the resulting nucleus has four protons and four neutrons: this is one form of the element beryllium. However, the lifetime of this particular form of beryllium is 10<sup>-16</sup> seconds, which gives that third helium nucleus a very small target to aim at. The change of hitting this target is incredibly small, and it turns out that the universe hasn&#39;t existed long enough for even a tiny fraction of its carbon to have been made in this way. So triple collisions are out, and carbon remains a puzzle.<br><br>&#39;Unless... there is a loophole in the argument. And indeed there is. The fusion of beryllium and helium, leading to carbon, would occur much more rapidly, yielding a lot more carbon in a much shorter time, if the energy of carbon just happened to be close to the combined energies of beryllium and helium. This kind of near-equality of energies is called a <i>resonance</i>. In the 1950s Fred Hoyle insisted that carbon has to come from somewhere, and predicted that there must therefore exist a resonant state of the carbon atom. It had to have a very specific energy, which he calculated must be about 7.6 MeV.<br><br>&#39;Within a decade, it was discovered that there is a state with energy 7.6549 MeV. Unfortunately, it turns out that the combined energies of beryllium and helium are about 4 per cent higher than this. In nuclear physics, that&#39;s a huge error.<br><br>&#39;Oops.<br><br>&#39;Ah, but miraculously, that apparent discrepancy is just what we want. Why? Because the additional energy imparted by the temperature found in a red giant star is exactly what&#39;s needed to change the combined energy of beryllium and helium nuclei by that missing 4 per cent.<br><br>&#39;Wow.<br><br>&#39;It&#39;s a wonderful story, and it rightly earned Hoyle huge numbers of scientific brownie points. And it makes our existence look rather delicate. If the fundamental constants of the universe are changed, then so is that vital 7.6549. So it is tempting to conclude that our universe&#39;s constants are fine-tuned for carbon, making it very special indeed. And it is equally tempting to conclude that the reason for that fine-tuning is to ensure that complex life turns up. Hoyle didn&#39;t do that, but many other scientists have given into these temptations.<br><br>&#39;Sounds good: what&#39;s wrong? [...] Another physicist, Craig Hogan, has put his finger on one of the weak points. The argument treats the temperature of the red giant and that 4 per cent discrepancy in energy levels as if they were independent. That is, it assumes that you can change the fundamental constants of physics without changing the way a red giant works. However, that&#39;s obvious nonsense. Hogan points out that &#39;the structure of stars includes a built-in thermostat that automatically adjusts the temperature to just the value needed to make the reaction go at the correct rate&#39;. It&#39;s rather like being amazed that the temperature in a fire is just right to burn wood, when in fact that temperature is caused by the chemical reaction that burns the wood...&#39;<br><br><hr>
<br><br>When they revisit it in a later book, they talk about how much variance you can have in the figures before stars become impossible. From memory, the conclusion was that roughly 25% of possible universes obtained from varying the fundamental constants would look substantially like ours.<br><br>So yeah: even if there has only ever been one universe, created by a completely random process, with no tuning of any kind... you&#39;ve still got around one chance in four that we&#39;d turn up to marvel at how lucky we are. ;)<br><br>hS<br><br>(PS: Or comets. Maybe the universe is fine tuned for comets. There&#39;s certainly a lot more of them than there are people, and they look so pretty... has any considered that our solar system might be a Christmas decoration?)</p>

            <p>Yes, it was mentioned in a previous interlude (&quot;Fate Amenable to Change&quot;) that she didn&#39;t want to use the Chameleon Arch because it would cause her to forget everything and replace her memories with false ones.<br><br>Plus, there would be weird questions like &quot;Hey, aren&#39;t you that agent who got turned into a Time Lord?&quot; which would jeopardize her Cham Arch disguise pretty fast.

            <p>I&#39;m assuming you&#39;re not just writing the character so you&#39;ll have the challenge of a phonetic accent, correct? <br><br>Speaking from experience in the POTC fandom...phonetic accents are <a href="http://heave-ho.livejournal.com/66917.html">very, very hard to do well</a>. I see it all the time, even in otherwise well-written fics, where poor Jack Sparrow ends up sounding like anything from street teenager to Southern to Scottish. Yes, Scottish.<br><br>On that occasion, Potcsues had some <a href="http://potcsues.livejournal.com/10970.html">mightily helpful advice</a> for prospective accent-writers: <br><br><i><b>Hasunoutena:</b> Is dialogue always written like that in PotC fics? Because after I read the snippets of that fic, I can&#39;t get the Scottish accent out of my head. I&#39;m sure that wasn&#39;t the intention.<br><br><b>Potcsues:</b> Well, not always.<br><br>Some people just don&#39;t feel like bothering with anyone having an accent at all and get caught up in making everyone speak &quot;proper&quot; English. Unfortunately, to make someone speak proper English one needs to have paid attention in an English class at least a few times in the course of their lifetime, so that never turns out well either.<br><br>It&#39;s very rare that someone just alludes to an accent, like people who know what the **** they&#39;re doing do when writing accents in fiction.</i><br><br>As for me, I wouldn&#39;t say that phonetic accents can&#39;t ever be written well under any circumstances, but I wouldn&#39;t advise anyone to try it without a strong background in linguistics or at least a few years listening to the accent on a regular basis. In addition to alluding to an accent, what will help distinguish your character&#39;s speech will be the word choices and colloquial expressions that he uses, which is usually more than enough for the readers to get the idea.<br><br>Ќ—Araeph</p>

            <p>Take refuge in audacity. Make this character the embodiment of all the <i>positive</i> stereotypes (e.g. always friendly, boisterously happy, likes loud and silly traditional drinking songs) and then make their accent completely ridiculous. If you&#39;re going to be stereotypical, and with a phoneticised accent you are whatever you try to do (consider any foreign Bond villain or the Dobermann from <i>Up</i>), the least you can do is be nice. =]</p>

            <p>The Cajun Accent is hard to replicate without sounding offensive, especially if you have not heard it properly.  Living in Louisiana, I have heard it, but in order to be most helpful I would like to know a little bit more.  You say near New Orleans, do you mean like a suburb of New Orleans?  Do you mean Baton Rouge?  Or do you mean Ascension Parish (Deep Bayou)?  Or do you Atchafalaya Basin (Swamp People from History Channel)?  There are slight differences in all of those accents, and all can be considered Cajun and near New Orleans.  <br><br>But for general advice I recommend three things.  First Diction should be your first choice, a phonetic Cajun accent runs the risk of becoming in comprehensible.  Second, and this is in most cases going to be a must, throw in a smattering of French.  Things like &#39;mon ami&#39; or &#39;laissez les bon temps rouler&#39; (Let the good times role) (Useful in certain circumstances), &#39;cher/cheri&#39; is another one.  And finally as a good generic guide in my opinion, look at Gambit from X-Men (Comics or Original 1990&#39;s Cartoon).  He works as a pretty good template.</p>

            <p>Other pedantic historian here!<br>No, the Declaration of Independence was not signed on July the second. It was ratified by Congress on July 4th, and thereafter accounts differ: either delegates present at the time signed it on that date, and others signed on the second of August; or one or none signed in July, and the official signed copy was ordered (maybe) in late July and signed in August.<br>July the second was when the states voted for independence - that is why Adams thought that it should become the national holiday.<br>(See Wikipedia for sources; I can&#39;t check book sources myself, and it&#39;s possible Wikipedia is completely wrong, though I find it&#39;s usually reliable for historical events.)</p>

            <p>&quot;Tuned in&quot; is a phrasal verb, rather than a verb and an adverb, so you can&#39;t replace the &quot;in&quot; and the preposition &quot;to&quot; that follows it with the single preposition &quot;into&quot;.<br>&quot;Tuned into&quot; would mean that something is being tuned from one state into another (e.g. the musical instrument was tuned into C from B-flat).<br>Gah, I don&#39;t think I&#39;m explaining this well.

            <p>Clearly you have a time machine. That&#39;s the only reasonable explanation for how you got this mission done so quickly. And that, sir, is <i>cheating!</i><br><br>Having said that... *squeee* astromechs! :)<br><br>Ahem, right, not sure what happened there... Must&#39;ve been a glitch or something. I am of course far too mature to squee over ridiculously cute robots, and far too honest to lie about it. I&#39;m glad we&#39;ve got that cleared up.<br><br>As for the questions you asked:<br>a) about as long as it took for me to read through the mission, then the A/N at the end.<br>b) given that I didn&#39;t notice what you had done until you pointed it out, the only way I can describe how it worked is &#39;seamlessly&#39;. <br>c) a good mission.<br><br>I liked the choice of disguise (I may have hinted at that earlier) - I don&#39;t recall seeing that one used before, which is always nice. I do however think it&#39;s a shame that you cheated (again! It&#39;s becoming a habit) with the droids&#39; dialogue, even though you did have a good reason for it. I&#39;ve been rereading a lot of the Expanded Universe recently, and there seems to be a trend in the later books to just give astromech speech normally, as you would for all the creatures that can speak Basic. The earlier books tended to describe the beeps that the mechs gave, letting you figure it out from the description, or give you another character&#39;s assumptions, or a reply from Threepio, etc., so that you could work out what had just been said. I think it&#39;s an interesting way of dealing with the language issues that came up in the films. <br><br>Obviously it wouldn&#39;t really have worked here, because with both of them communicating via beeps I think it would&#39;ve been too difficult to get across all the details/subtleties of what was being said, but I must admit that I still found it slightly disappointing to just read their dialogue as if they hadn&#39;t donned their disguises. <br><br>Having said that, I never forgot that the characters were disguised - you included a several nice touches that worked as reminders. I particularly liked Freckles&#39; response to being told to &#39;focus&#39;. <br><br>All in all, nicely done.<br><br>- Irish</p>

            <p>Ahem. Yeah, I don&#39;t think that would&#39;ve worked when the only two characters both speak in bleeps. <sup>_^</sup> The first place I remember running across &#39;Artoo speaks in tongues&#39; was in one of the Aaron Allston NJO books, where it was in a scene with Artoo as the third-person viewpoint character (which led to a lot of thinking about how easily manipulated Threepio is, as I recall); I think in that specific case it was okay, though it was probably italicised too...<br><br>Anyway, it still can&#39;t be as bad as the reverse: &quot;Grrrr wrrowl raaargh!&quot; said Chewbacca. <i>Courtship of Princess Leia</i>, how I despise that editorial decision. <sup>_<sup><br><br>Anyway:</sup></sup> thank you! Sorry for being slightly disappointing.

            <p>As far as the mission itself goes, my honest-to-God favorite part was the bit at the end where they discuss whether or not they would have reacted as strongly to it if it had been about different characters.  I think that&#39;s an interesting issue for PPC agents in general - how objective can you be when you&#39;re dealing with badfic about someone you care for?  How objective <i>should</i> you be?  And what about when it&#39;s not just a character you admire, but someone who, from your perspective, is a real person?  Definitely an entry for the list of &quot;themes I want to explore at some point.&quot;<br><br>On the gimmick: I think it only worked because of how short the mission was, and because there weren&#39;t really any action scenes (meaning &quot;scenes where the agents take direct actions,&quot; not specifically fight scenes).  The characters felt a little like talking heads at times, and it bordered on being more of an MST than a mission.<br><br>I think part of the reason I didn&#39;t catch on, by the way, is that you had a pair of female characters and a pair of male characters.  In that situation, you actually need to avoid overusing pronouns when you&#39;re describing things, lest you run into the Pronoun Problem.  This is also why I cheated and specifically made a mixed-gender agent pair.  <br><br>As far as wider implications go, I can accept that gender might not be necessary as a grammatical construct, but I think it&#39;s still an integral part of a lot of people&#39;s identities.  We don&#39;t need it for our language to make sense, we need it because it&#39;s part of expressing who we are.  Not saying you&#39;re denying that, but it&#39;s just my feelings on the issue.</p>

            <p>Re: the gimmick - there were always going to be factors that aided it, and I admit I skewed the mission heavily to keep them in place. But even so! It&#39;s not so much &#39;she&#39; I missed as &#39;her&#39; - Sandra could never turn <b>her</b> head, for instance (though, as I said somewhere, in actual usage you&#39;d just see &#39;their&#39; all over the place).<br><br>As to gender: I accept that, since gender exists, people can, do, and should identify by way of it. But... well, perhaps I lack an understanding of the subject. But I find it difficult to come up with an attribute which needs to be called &#39;male&#39; (or &#39;female&#39;, for that matter) without it being a) sexist (er, genderist?), b) sexual (which of course isn&#39;t gender), or c) a societal negative which would be better done away with (eg, &#39;men tend to be promoted further than women&#39;). But that maybe reflects a lack of imagination on my part?<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>It&#39;s BLEU! Da-ba-dee da-ba-die. =]<br><br>Anyway, I&#39;m planning a mission to insane trollfic Brewdening Love, and that got me to thinking about when I was an active part of the weird cult following it amassed, much akin to that of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_Norton">Emperor Norton</a>. The key pairing in the Brewdening Love Expanded Universe is Brugo, or Brian/Hugo - Brian being an agent of about eight different agencies, depending on the price of tinned cheese in Wichita and the strength of the most recent tropical storm to hit Palau, and Hugo being an alcoholic deadbeat with hidden depths. I wrote recursive fanfiction for this pairing. It was entirely in haiku.<br><br>Since you need an account on what used to be TwilightSucks.com to access it, I would now like to present my magnum opus.<br><br>---<br><br><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WGi53etm6lHpfXjGwiYHGy7qtZdy3KHuso5EyVJ8WAg/edit?usp=sharing">Haikudening Love</a><br><br>---<br><br>I apologise for the length (despite it being eternally unfinished deadfic), but I&#39;d be interested in your views on my work. Yes, it&#39;s pretentious. Yes, it&#39;s long. Yes, there are herons everywhere for no adequately-explained reason. I just value your input, and I love how welcome you&#39;ve made me feel since my return, so I wanted to show you a thing wot I did. =]<br><br>Oh, and before anyone asks - spelling sinners SINNARS (block caps optional) was something of a <i>thing</i> in the BLEU fandom. It was a strange place. =]</p>

            <p>The haiku are very impressive.

            <p>Just that they aren&#39;t killed by the methods of &quot;death&quot; common to Nuzlocke runs, which are releasing and storage. I&#39;m going by a much more literalist take on it, wherein the Trainer is considerably more of an arsehole than is usual in a Pokйmon game. Nuzlockes are very much a case of &quot;<a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveFailedMe">You Have Failed Me</a>&quot; in my book, with the Trainer punishing weakness by leaving unconscious mons on the ground as food for passing local wildlife.<br><br>But yeah, Pokйmon can be killed by fighting each other, and by fighting humans. However, it&#39;s <i>tricky</i>. Protect is a good example of this - allowing a mon to weather a move, no matter what it is, takes an amazing amount of strength. Plus there&#39;s all the ridiculous dex entries about their fortitude, strength, and occasionally murderous tendencies (looking at you, Hypno, Dragalge, and Drifloon). =]</p>

            <p>At least a little? I, personally, consider it canon unless contradicted by the movies or tv shows. Memory Alpha seems to consider it non-canon, while TV Tropes seems to consider it fully canon. So, does anyone know where it sits on the &#39;canon spectrum?&#39; Hey, a canon spectrum might be a good idea...<br><br>I just want to know so I can properly use a (prototype)Odyssey cruiser in a fanfic I&#39;m writing.</p>

            <p>With Star Trek, anything that&#39;s not from the live-action movies or tv shows isn&#39;t canon, end of story.  However, a lot of people will declare elements of non-canon works part of their personal canon.  So unless something in one of the episodes contradicts it, feel free to use it, though maybe put a comment in the author&#39;s notes or something.<br><br>(The EU moment that&#39;s totally part of my personal canon?  The part from <i>Spock&#39;s World</i> where Amanda responds to a tabloid headline about her having married a little green man by saying &quot;There&#39;s nothing little about my husband.&quot;)</p>

            <p>If you mean for the PPC, I&#39;m not sure how often it would apply.  It&#39;s really only relevant for series with expanded universes.  That said, I do think there&#39;s already an explanation of the differences between canon/fanon/headcanon.  If you mean just for Star Trek, I&#39;d have to say no.  Personally, I find the Star Wars canon levels to be way too confusing to keep track of, and I like that the Star Trek rule is immediately discernible.</p>

            <p>As in, just one more thing for agents to complain about. But, as you&#39;ve said, some canons are really confusing, so why not have characters argue over where things go? It could be a nice bit of meta humour, because all-too-many fans will know the same pain. The PPC started, after all, as a way to have some fun with something really annoying. A canon spectrum argument would go something like:<br><br>&quot;We should place the comics over here, because they are clearly less canon&quot;<br><br>&quot;I disagree; we should place them ahead of the books!&quot; Which could be funny. (Also, that is the first time in my life I have ever used a semicolon for anything except programming.)</p>

            <p>For those unaware, Comedy Central is streaming every single Jon Stewart era episode of <i>The Daily Show.</i> They&#39;re calling it Your Month of Zen (even though it&#39;s actually going to run for about 42 days). As of this post, they&#39;ve gotten up to January 2001. I&#39;ve been sorta watching it on and off — I work from home, so I put it on my tablet as a background kind of thing. So, I wanted to share some of my thoughts on what I&#39;ve seen so far.<br><br>A lot of those early episodes are, perhaps unsurprisingly, pretty uneven. The show was more of a flat local news parody than a satire. A lot of the correspondent field reports felt almost mean-spirited at times. And some of the jokes? Wow. If you weren&#39;t happy with those jokes that got upcoming host Trevor Noah in trouble, you would definitely be displeased with some of those early bits. Especially whenever the show dubbed over a foreign speaker. <br><br>Somewhat related, I wasn&#39;t too pleased with how much the show relied on specialty schtick correspondents. Unlike the regular correspondents, these would be people that basically had their own reoccurring thematic skit. A lot of these were very one note. They had one joke, and they drove it into the ground. Lewis Black&#39;s &quot;Back in Black&quot; bits were the best, which is probably why they are the only example left in the modern show.<br><br>All that being said, there&#39;s still some good glimpses of the show to come. The coverage leading up to the 2000 election (and the debacle that followed) is an excellent example. The first post-election episode showing everyone&#39;s ragged despondency was great. It&#39;s also interesting to see the big news stories of the time. It&#39;s like a time capsule, but funny!<br><br>One thing I&#39;m looking forward to is the first episode after 9/11. Stewart&#39;s speech is wonderful and, to me, that very much feels like the first true example of the show as it exists now.<br><br>Has anyone else been following the stream, or simply watch <i>The Daily Show</i>? I&#39;m curious to hear what other people think.</p>

            <p>Sorry it took so long to get to this. &#39;S been crazy busy here.<br><br>I have to admit, I couldn&#39;t really get into this mission all that much. Part of the problem for me was the interactions between the various agents. It all felt very lackluster apart from the flirting between Valon and Kala. I thought that was all right, if a bit out of place. I had to roll my eyes at the &quot;overreacting agent&quot; trope again.<br><br>Also, there were quite a few gags that just sort of fell flat. The physical jokes in particular (like Valon pulling things out of his pockets) didn&#39;t work. I understand that humor is a subjective topic, but I think it can be argued that prop comedy does not necessarily translate all that well to the written medium.<br><br>A few last questions/concerns regarding the main mission:<br>— Was it ever explained why there was no first-person dummy and they didn&#39;t get possessed, or did I miss that part?<br>— Were povs as creatures first introduced in this mission? I can&#39;t find any mention of them on the wiki.<br>— The first mini that showed up (the sparklewolf) was never named in text, that I saw. It&#39;s advisable to always state their name in the mission itself.<br>— Why did they use Retcon and not a neuralyzer? Retcon is more easily undone, if I understand it correctly.<br><br>Now, on to the dragon interlude. It was charming enough, but as Tira said, it was confusing given that it wasn&#39;t explained who the kids were. Having wiki entries is fine and all, but a good story should give you all the information you need inside itself. <br><br>All in all, I&#39;d say these stories need work. They just feel really rough to me. Other people have obviously differed, so make of my thoughts what you will.<br><br>PC</p>

            <p>Though I (thankfully) never read <i>Twilight</i>, and only have a passing knowledge of <i>Eragon</i> thanks to the movie, the mission wasn&#39;t totally incomprehensible. This was pretty well-written.<br><br>But, of course, I&#39;ve spotted a few errors.<br><br>First off, a Latin error:<br><i>Oh, and ‘<b></b></i>carus unus<i>’ is completely the wrong way to say ‘dear one’ or ‘my dear,’ she should probably be calling Bella ‘</i>cara mia<i>’.</i><br>You&#39;re off by one letter. The word for &quot;my,&quot; declined to feminine vocative singular, is <i>mea</i>.<br><i>Mia</i> is a Latin word, but it&#39;s actually a verb in the imperative singular, and <a href="http://lysy2.archives.nd.edu/cgi-bin/words.exe?mia">I&#39;m pretty sure that its meaning is <i>not</i> the concept you&#39;re looking for</a>.<br><br>The remaining issues are in the English:<br>1) <i>The disguised girtablilu set to shredding Valon’s shirt with a will,</i><br>Please explain what you&#39;re trying to say here. I don&#39;t get it.<br><br>2) <i>Since you’re the Disentangler, and all.</i><br>This error is minor, but I&#39;d suggest deleting the comma.</p>

            <p>With the Latin, I was going with the Portal song, which refers to the subject as &quot;cara mia.&quot; I&#39;ll change it if it&#39;s incorrect, though.<br><br>As for the thing with Kala, to &quot;set to (activity) with a will&quot; is to do something with a lot of energy. Kala&#39;s pretty much lost to the moon at that point; literally all of her thoughts are &quot;Love Valon, warm Valon, join with Valon Valon Valon Valon Valon Valon Valon Valon Valon.&quot;</p>

            <p>As for the Portal song, perhaps the &quot;cara mia&quot; was supposed to be in Italian, not Latin. Otherwise, they got it wrong.<br><br>As for Kala, it looks like I learned a new turn-of-phrase. Perhaps it&#39;s not that familiar where I live...</p>

            <p>The mission was pretty good.  I like the advancement of Valon and Kala&#39;s relationship, and Kozar is very funny.  I didn&#39;t think Bella could be even more of a Sue, but obviously I was wrong.<br><br>I found the Ten Years Hence story to be overly confusing, personally.  I&#39;m not familiar with the majority of the characters, and the wiki isn&#39;t helping me figure out who they are.</p>

            <p>Ruth is new, of course, but of the remaining seven characters, three are mine, and out of <i>those</i> only Seren and Owain have so far appeared in anything on or linked to the Board--<a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=256304;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">the first Purim RP</a>* (I don&#39;t think they made it into the second). I didn&#39;t even quite realize I could make pages for them until it was already pretty late my time, so I&#39;ve left it for the morning. I&#39;ll link them here once I&#39;ve made them--probably within the next few hours. Sorry about that.<br><br>The thing about Bella, of course, is that SMeyer--oddly enough--didn&#39;t go as overboard with her powers as she could have. That is to say, even as a vampire she didn&#39;t get <i>multiple</i> powers--just one heavily lauded one. She&#39;s a different type of Sue in canon than she was in this fic, which...yeah, makes this one stand out. At least SMeyer didn&#39;t hit <i>all</i> the Sue cliches; &quot;Legend of the Night Angel&quot; managed to hit a whole bunch more, and even swap some out for each other. And I still don&#39;t get why Zack Night had that weird blue swirl in his eyes--he&#39;s not a &#39;hybrid&#39;, but this Bella also had one--oh, right. Logic. Doesn&#39;t work. I will stop.<br><br>And that makes another person who likes Kozar. Huh. I like him well enough myself, but I hadn&#39;t expected even this much favorable response to him. It&#39;s interesting.<br><br>Thanks for sharing your thoughts!<br><br>~DF<br><br>--<br>*Link goes to their appearance, not the beginning of the RP. That can be found <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=256079;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">here</a> (for the beginning of the segment they appeared in), and <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=255865;">here</a> (for the beginning of the Purim RP itself).</p>
