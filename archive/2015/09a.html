            <p>Thank you, Iximaz. I guess all of us HP fans needed something like this. <br>What Rowling said is so true! For us these stories will never be over and will live in our hearts. No matter how much time has passed since the official end of the series, I for one will always look back with wonder and joy to that wonderful time in my life when I first experienced each and everyone of these amazing stories. </p>

            <p>I mean ones which add bad characters or quests/missions. New Vegas and Fallout 3, for example, have tons of companion/minion mods. Some/most of which, as Sturgeon&#39;s Law dictates, are bad to some degree. I&#39;m not talking about things which are simply buggy, but things which are honest-to-god terrible. Can these be killed, as they&#39;re technically badfic? If so, I may go hunting for a really, really bad one once I get permission.<br><br>Side idea, once the modding utilities for Fallout 4 come out, would anyone want a mod that allows you to join the PPC? It was just a funny idea I had while eating lunch.</p>

            <p>I can see this also applying to hack games (say, Pokemon). Especially when they introduce new maps, storylines, et cetera.<br><br>Also, I don&#39;t see why technical aspects CAN&#39;T be targeted. We target technical aspects (i.e. SPaG) in fanfic, why not target technical aspects (i.e. glitches) in mods and hacks?<br><br>Of course, the technical aspects can&#39;t be the only thing problematic, there has to be actual sues or Player-Sues involved.<br><br>I also see a special type of Crash Dummy used for this, one that is controlled remotely to mimic the player controlling his character.</p>

            <p>As for your main question... I suppose?  If you just got a copy of the script and used that, I don&#39;t see how it would be substantially different from a normal badfic, from an out-of-universe perspective.  Obviously the agents would find it to be a unique experience.  That said, it would definitely have to be ones that focused on the poor writing of the mod; criticizing other elements of mod design is slightly outside the scope of the PPC.</p>

            <p>I hope this is just a temporary blip, and not the start of a trend. I can&#39;t recall the Board going down before, and now it&#39;s happened twice in quick succession. Don&#39;t think we need to do anything about it just yet (as the old saying goes, &#39;once is happenstance, twice is coincidence, three times is enemy action&#39; - we&#39;re still at the coincidence stage), and it would be good if yourwebapps can explain what happened, but if it keeps up... <br><br>It&#39;s also rather annoying that these have been problems with yourwebapps as a whole, so they&#39;ve taken out our main Board and back-up simultaneously - which sort of defeats the point having a back-up!<br><br>On a slightly related note, I&#39;m still having occasional problems with ads/redirects. Not as bad as when we were discussing it a few weeks ago, but they are definitely still there for me, and it&#39;s still worse on my tablet than it is on my laptop.<br><br>- Irish </p>

            <p>Did the badfic say that the Sue is a heavy sleeper? Lavender, Parvati and Hermione apparently got up in time to have breakfast and then go to the Potions class. Could the Sue really sleep through all the noise they probably made? Would Lavender and Parvati not try to shake her awake when she obviously oversleeps? (Hermione is evil in this fic, thus it’s possible she wouldn’t.) <br><br>Assuming that Dumbledore’s stupid plan to get the Sue and Harry into his office by making her oversleep depended on the other girls letting her oversleep makes this plan even more stupid than it is anyway. So what this comes down to is: I don’t believe that your agents <i>stepped into what looked like the girls’ bedroom</i>. Doing this after the portal had already <i>transported the agents to a Generic Bedroom</i> is also a bit of a continuity error.<br><br>With another badfic, I might buy that the Generic Bedroom transformed into the girls’ dormitory when the agents (and the word world) realized that the Sue woke up at Hogwarts. But here, although the Sue didn’t brag about being so speshul that she got a room on her own, and didn’t whine about being segregated from the other girls because she was considered to be a monster, I’m quite sure that she woke up in her private bedroom, not in a dormitory. She probably got her own, private bathroom too.<br><br>BTW, I can accept that a Hogwarts setting defaults to Gryffindor Tower if not stated otherwise, but how did your agents figure out that this is Hogwarts rather than the Sue’s home before the end of the first paragraph? IMO it would have been better to keep this in a generic environment until the Sue was reminded that she was late for class.<br><br>After this mediocre start, the mission became quite good, although I don’t appreciate everybody utilizing the Room of Requirements. I actually liked the open end, but I wonder what happened or will happen to Triste Malfoy. <br><br>I won’t talk about grammar here. I’ll send you an e-mail.<br><br>HG</p>

            <p>1) No, nowhere in the badfic was stated that the Sue had any sleeping problems, or was a heavy sleeper. Also, maybe it counts as a spoiler, but later in the story turns out the Patil twins were also Death Eaters (<i>sigh...</i>)<br><br>2) This is a mistake on my part, yes. The first version had the agents being <i>transportef into a Generic Dormitory</i> and then proceeding to the bedroom. Thank you, for pointing that out.<br><br>As for &#39;Triste Malfoy&#39; and Tyrone... I just assumed they were able to assimilate into the canon, after the Suefluence disappeared.</p>

            <p>I don&#39;t know what this author was thinking! Half-angel, half-demon has the potential for some interesting plot, but the author is just using it to angst. Pity.<br><br>Looking on the bright side, they do seem to have some interesting ideas. Muggle Tech classes at Hogwarts, for example. A gay-straight alliance at Hogwarts. It&#39;s just that they&#39;re not doing anything interesting with them. They&#39;re just... killing off characters they don&#39;t like. And poor Hermione...<br><br>As for being asexual when you&#39;re an angel... Not sure whether to roll my eyes at the sex-is-evil implication or thank the author for mentioning asexuals to begin with. The idea of fluid sexuality is kind of interesting, though--like being genderqueer, but with attraction rather than gender identity? I dunno. Yet another interesting idea that didn&#39;t get any play.<br><br>My hopes are that this particular author will mature into someone who can write well, because with the interesting ideas spoiled by a Sue, it makes me wonder what this writer could do with some practice.</p>

            <p>This fic was so stupid that I was literally uttering incoherent gibberish every so often! If even the <i>excerpts</i> made my brain BSOD, then I doubt that I&#39;d be able to survive the undiluted badfic.<br>Please tell me that this was a troll. I fear for the human race if someone seriously thought that this was good writing!<br><br>BTW, You might want to add a NSFB tag to the NSFW one.<br><br>As for the mission itself, it was OK, especially for a first. However, there was a whole mess of errors:<br><br>1) <i><b>&quot;Your dads sound cool.&quot; He said</b> as <b>they approached the door to Dumbledoor&#39;s office.</b> The Sue opened the door and they disappeared behind them. As soon as that happened, William and VJ left their cover and went towards the Generic Courtyard.</i><br><br>Who disappeared from behind whom? And how?<br><br>2) <i>The warlock finally removed his hand and let <u>her</u> partner sit on the bench, shoving the mini aside.</i><br>I don&#39;t think you meant to genderbend William so soon in his PPC career!<br><br>3-4) <i>The Room of Requirement had everything the agents needed; apart from a place to sleep, and a small bookshelf, it also contained a wide but shallow basin filled with transparent liquid.</i><br>Replace the semicolon with a colon or a period. Delete the comma before &quot;and a small bookshelf&quot;.<br><br>5-6) <i>Dumbledore calmed the Sue down, and told her she would receive no punishment. Instead, it turned out it was him who messed around with her alarm clock so she would be late to the class, <u>got</u> into an argument with Snape, and eventually be sent <u>here</u>.</i><br>First off, there&#39;s a tense shift. The full verb is &quot;would get,&quot; hence you should have &quot;get&quot; there, not &quot;got&quot;.<br>Secondly, there&#39;s a word choice error.

Correct punctuation is thus: <i>&quot;Good call,&quot; the warlock said.</i><br><br>8) <i>“S****!” The warlock hissed,</i><br>It does not matter whether the quote ends with a comma or with another punctuation mark; if you are adding a tag and the next word is not a proper noun, the word is lowercase.<br><br>9) <i>Naturally, she didn’t a lot of convincing and quickly agreed to join the Sue in her shenanigans.</i><br>You missed a word.<br><br>10) <i>The agents scratched their heads, wondering where this was going, when the Sue deduced that this <u>girl pretty blonde</u> had to be related to <u>Malfoy’s</u> in some way.</i><br>Did the first set of underlined words get scrambled? And what&#39;s with the random possessive noun?<br><br>11) <i>It doesn’t seem like it but we’ve been here for a while, and my stomach’s starting to feel it.</i><br>You&#39;re missing a comma before &quot;but we&#39;ve been here for a while.&quot;<br><br>12) <i>“He could be an under the Imperius.”</i><br>Delete the &quot;an.&quot;<br><br>13) <i>hitmen crew</i><br>Multiple times. It should be &quot;hitm<u>a</u>n crew&quot;: when a noun is being used as an adjective, use the singular, never the plural.<br><br>14) <i>Tyrone chose a pistol as well and a knife.</i><br>Either replace that &quot;and&quot; with an &quot;as&quot; or delete the &quot;as well.&quot;<br><br>15) <i>“Well, that’s one good news today.”</i><br>Missing words: &quot;that&#39;s one <u>piece of</u> good news today.&quot;<br><br>16) <i>William and VJ managed to hide under the Hufflepuff table, when the crew entered.</i><br>Delete the comma.<br><br>16) <i>The tickling sensation of its pincers against William’s side made the warlock stifle a laughter.</i><br>&quot;stifle a laugh&quot; or &quot;stifle his laughter&quot;<br><br>17) <i>VJ … shoved the Grand Hall mini into the portal. <br>…<br>Suddenly, William felt something nudging his side.

The tickling sensation of its pincers against William’s side made the warlock stifle a laughter. <br>“Oh, that’s Grand Hall,” explained VJ, looking at the Words. “Yeah, he’s gonna be here for a while, no sense in sending him off just yet.”</i><br><br>Did VJ send Grand Hall through a portal or not? You&#39;re contradicting yourself. Please clarify.<br><br>18) <i>[The explosion] provided an excellent cover for the agents to escape the Great Hall (and sending Grand Hall to the HFA)</i><br>Another tense shift. It should be &quot;send&quot;, not &quot;sending&quot;.<br><br>19) <i>Dumbledore told them here was going to show them something interesting.</i><br>I believe you mean &quot;he&quot; instead of &quot;here.&quot;<br><br>20) <i>They looked like made of neon rope</i><br>You missed two words this time: &quot;They looked like <u>they were</u> made of neon rope&quot;.<br><br>21) <i>Next thing they noticed, was a thick layer of white fog curling by their ankles</i><br>Delete the comma.<br><br>22) <i>“My magic!” The Sue cried</i><br>Please see 8).<br><br>23-24) <i>The Sue and Harry quickly pointed their guns at VJ, but when they pulled the triggers they’ve heard only clicking.</i><br>Insert a comma after &quot;triggers&quot;.

            <p>Not extremely slow--like, days plus, which would be psychological torture if the Sue is conscious and has enough characterization to recognize that it&#39;s dying--but, yes.<br><br>Paralyzing a Suvian while reading the charges, for example, is a classic strategy.<br><br>Some Suvians simply don&#39;t die fast. Sometimes there&#39;s a good ironic death.<br><br>But do remember, your agents&#39; job isn&#39;t finished until the canon is repaired--and while the main Sue is still alive, most canons won&#39;t snap back.

            <p>Though I would&#39;ve liked to see a bit more of a post-mission at least, with the agents returning to their RC and such. The fic itself, of course, was utterly horrifying (i.e. even the <i>excerpts</i> showed how stupid it was), so thank you for sporking it. AFAIK, neither angels nor demons exist in HP, so a hybrid of both is inherently nonsensical.<br><br>As for proofreading, though, it looks like you might need a little help with wrangling a few stray commas:<br><i>The agents had to hug the wall<b>,</b> as the Sue turned to see who made such a noise.</i><br><i>“There’s no way I’m lettin’ you near them<b>,</b> right now.</i><br><i>The Sue told Harry<b>,</b> how one of her fathers struck a deal with Azrael[...]</i><br><i>Dumbledore gestured at the wardrobe-slash-armoury-slash-closet<b>,</b> and told the hitmen to get inside.</i><br><br><i>Since she was immortal, <b>accidental explosion</b> wouldn’t kill her.</i><br>Should be either &quot;an accidental explosion&quot; or &quot;accidental explosions&quot;.<br><br><i>Nobody raised their hands (even the agents)</i><br>Just a matter of personal taste, but I&#39;d have changed the stuff in parentheses to &quot;not even the agents&quot;.<br><br><i>She yelped and waved her hand in pain, failing to notice a sudden headbutt which made her hit the wall and <b>slum</b> unconscious to the ground.</i><br>The correct word is &quot;slump&quot;.</p>

            <p>So, I&#39;ve had this idea for a fan fiction in my head for a while now, but I&#39;ve hit a bit of a roadblock on characters. I was wondering if anyone&#39;s willing to help<br><br>Basically, it&#39;s a variation of TF2&#39;s &#39;Meet the Team&#39; videos, but with characters and creatures from horror games as the classes. So far, I&#39;ve decided on these classes:<br><br>Heavy-Chris Walker (Outlast) [Both are huge, powerful, and don&#39;t seem to talk very much]<br>Medic-Chica (FNaF) [I have a pretty good idea on how exactly her chapter&#39;s going to go, and I have a design for her Medigun visualized]<br>Sniper-Freddy Fazbear? (FNaF) [Freddy spends most of his time watching from behind the front lines, but I&#39;m not averse to other ideas]<br>Spy-Either the Puppet (FNaF) or Slenderman (Slender) [Slenderman&#39;s completely featureless face could shift to look like those of his victims, and the Puppet&#39;s attack strategy, for lack of a better term, is remarkably similar to Spy&#39;s]<br>Demoman-Foxy (FNaF) [They both have eyepatches, and I already have some dialogue written for this particular one. Plus, the idea of Foxy launching himself into the air with Sticky Bombs is too hilarious to pass up]<br><br>The dialogue is going to be changed quite a bit from the videos that the fanfic is based on, but it will stay somewhat similar, but as I&#39;ve said, I have no idea on who some of the classes will be. Does anyone here have any ideas?</p>

            <p>I&#39;m not familiar with TF2, or much into horror games for that matter, but it seems more like a FNaF fic with guest appearances from other characters, as opposed to a balanced look at the horror genre.<br><br>What about Pyramid Head?

            <p>So, I was working on my writing prompts for my permission request (which aren&#39;t done yet), and I encountered something that I&#39;m not quite clear on.<br><br>Is there a PPC policy on swearing? Because the problem is, unfortunately, it&#39;s in character for one of my Agents. It&#39;s not something I originally counted on, but the genre of his fic of origin dabbles in that sort of thing quite a bit. I tried researching this, and found a list of alternative swear words on the wiki, but I also encountered some missions that feature profanity.<br><br>So, is profanity up to my own discretion, or are there some rules on that?<br><br>Semper erit insanus</p>

            <p>For a dog, I&#39;d go with an Eevee (or, of course, any of its evolutionary relatives). The regional dogs are also an option- Growlithe line, Houndour, Poochyena, Lillipup, et cetera.<br><br>For a cat, my choice is the Hoenn regional cats, the Skitty line, as they start out a housecat and also end a housecat. So many regional cats start as housecats and end as big cats. Of course, if you <i>prefer</i> a Persian to a Delcatty, be my guest, but do remember that a Persian is as big as a lioness.</p>

            <p>Thanks for that link, although the list was almost the only part of it I understood.<br><br>Before I joined the PPC, practically all I knew about Pokemon was that it was a cartoon about a yellow blob, a man with very squinty eyes, and a woman who wore a T-shirt with an R on it.  It was shown on TV-AM&#39;s <i>Wide Awake Club </i>(or whatever it was called by then) in the nineties.  (There might&#39;ve been a spin-off movie, since I think I remember seeing posters of the yellow blob on the sides of buses.)<br><br>Unfortunately, this was when I was getting too old for children&#39;s cartoons.  I couldn&#39;t even get that ironic &quot;so stupid it&#39;s good&quot; pleasure from them any more.<br><br>Since joining the PPC, I&#39;ve learnt that (a) Pokemon isn&#39;t the yellow blob&#39;s name, but a generic term for all blobby creatures; and (b) there was also a spin-off computer game that some of you have played.<br></p>

            <p><b>The Gym:</b><br>This gym is very open air - possibly on account of the ancient-looking temple having been ruined for some time and exposed to the elements. Dig trenches have been cut into the earth and the Gym is a mess of duckboards, tents, excitable people clutching shards of ancient pottery, and whatever the blarting hell a geophysicist is. In the depths of the dig, though, lies Leader Vowel, dusty books clustered around him, slowly translating the cuneiform on the massive sandstone monolith behind him.<br><br><b>The Team (postgame):</b><br>Mega Camerupt @ Cameruptite<br>Solid Rock --&gt; Sheer Force<br>Fire Blast<br>Earth Power<br>Ancient Power<br>Flash Cannon<br><br>Quagsire @ Leftovers<br>Unaware<br>Scald<br>Recover<br>Acid Spray<br>Encore<br><br>Torterra @ Miracle Seed<br>Overgrow<br>Wood Hammer<br>Earthquake<br>Rock Polish<br>Synthesis<br><br>Diggersby @ Focus Sash<br>Huge Power<br>Earthquake<br>Return<br>Quick Attack<br>Swords Dance<br><br>Flygon @ Life Orb<br>Levitate<br>Draco Meteor<br>Roost<br>Earth Power<br>Defog<br><br>Stunfisk @ Soft Sand<br>Static<br>Stealth Rock<br>Discharge<br>Earth Power<br>Eerie Impulse<br><br><b>The Phat Lewts:</b><br>The Diphthong badge is made of butter-coloured sandstone with the shape &quot;/aʊ/&quot; carved into it.

Or Arnyellë can roll up into a ball and hit it.<br><br>((That&#39;s called &#39;Gyro Ball&#39;.))<br><br>No, it&#39;s called rolling up into a ball and hitting it.<br><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/Honchkrow.png"><br><br>Can you guess what I&#39;m calling this one?<br><br>((&#39;A crow in a hat&#39;?))<br><br>Correct. And since it&#39;s a bird, we&#39;ll hit it with rocks. Arnyellë&#39;s got some of those, so has Salgant.<br><br>((Are you going to make use of the REST of your Pokemon at any point?))<br><br>Sure. We&#39;ll have Raumo magic up some extra Special Attack and a little doll and pass them onto whoever needs them. Happy? Don&#39;t care. Moving on.<br><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/Weavile.png"><br><br>Okay, it&#39;s a weasel in a collar. At least they&#39;re trying now.<br><br>((You&#39;re going to call it &#39;a weasel in a collar&#39;, aren&#39;t you?))<br><br>No, I&#39;m going to call it Ar-Pharazon the Golden. It looks just like him. And since it&#39;s vulnerable to rocks, it&#39;ll go down the same way as him, too. Or Aglon can punch it. Next!<br><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/Scrafty.png"><br><br>That.<br><br>What is that.<br><br>((That&#39;s a Scrafty.))<br><br>It&#39;s an abomination.<br><br>((No, it&#39;s a Pokemon. I <b>told</b> you they weren&#39;t just animals.))<br><br>It&#39;s a scruffy, goofy-looking thing with dumb hair that can&#39;t keep its trousers from falling down.<br><br>((And it&#39;s half-fighting, so Aglon won&#39;t-))<br><br>I&#39;m calling it Beren.<br><br>((...))<br><br>Yup. So, Dark/Fighting. Ideally we&#39;d want to hit it with Fairy, but we don&#39;t-<br><br>((You can&#39;t call it Beren.))<br><br>Just did. Ironically, Fighting is still good against it, but we can also use Flying. That means-<br><br>((Seriously, choose a different name.))<br><br>Nope. Actually, Iris doesn&#39;t have a Flying attack, but that Heat Wave should at least do normal-<br><br>((You could call it &#39;Morgoth&#39;, that&#39;d be good for a laugh.))<br><br>Beren will lash out with Dark, Fighting, and Rock, so actually Iris wouldn&#39;t be a good choice-<br><br>((Or &#39;Aragorn&#39;, even, he was a mess.))<br><br>Honestly, it&#39;s looking like sending in Aglon yet again is our all-around best choice. So that&#39;s-<br><br>((Dafydd. You can&#39;t call it &#39;Beren&#39;.))<br><br>- about it for Beren, and I think for the list. That wasn&#39;t so bad. Who&#39;s next?<br><br>&gt;Dafydd Illian<br>((There is no way we can win against that team. Seriously. ~hS))</p>

            <p>That Shell Smash boost from Gorebyss (who I shall refer to as &quot;Aiguille&quot; from now on) offers a fantastic boost to both offensive and speed stats-- Baton Pass that to Gyarados (&quot;Riptide&quot;) and suddenly you get a mighty Mega-capable, Earthquake-using monster that can act as a decent physical sweeper.<br><br>Yeah, not too shabby.<br><br>Also, I assume that that Politoed is there to set up rain, right?

            <p>It&#39;s there as a rain setter, yeah (hence Damp Rock - weather is no longer permanent in Gen VI), but mostly it&#39;s there as an offensive support - you use it to spread status effects with Toxic and lock people into stuff with Encore. Scald&#39;s really only there because otherwise you&#39;re Taunt bait. =]<br><br>Other than that, yeah, Gorebyss is designed as a SmashPasser, hence the White Herb. Baton Pass carries stat drops over as well, so having it there means you can set up with Shell Smash in the rain and (hopefully) use Baton Pass to only give the boosts. +2 Attack and Speed on a Mega Gyarados? dats just cray cray yo.</p>

            <p>Pokemon are magical monsters which people can capture and use to fight each other (ie, pit fights, without the pit). The most structured fights take place in what are called Gyms - it&#39;s not the Elves who&#39;re getting the workout, it&#39;s the Pokemon. The Gym is lead by one person - in this case, me - who Pokemon trainers have to beat to get a shiny badge.<br><br>Then we see the list of Gym Leader Huinesoron&#39;s six Pokemon. You get the Pokemon species (such as Girafarig), and then the item they&#39;re holding (@ followed by, for instance, a Silk Scarf). On the next line, you get their innate ability - Claydol has Levitate, for instance, so is always... uh... levitating.<br><br>Then you have the four moves for each Pokemon - their spells or literal attacks. Fire Punch is literally a punch with the Pokemon&#39;s hand on fire. They use these as instructed against the opposing Pokemon.<br><br>Beating a Gym Leader nets you two things: a pretty badge to say you&#39;ve done it, and a move, which you can teach to your own Pokemon. So if your little demons successfully magic mine into oblivion, I&#39;ll give you a badge shaped like a Silmaril, and a move that helps your Pokemon focus. And some begrudging congratulations.<br><br><a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=282645;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">These</a> are my six Pokemon in the order Scapegrace listed them. The first two pictures are actually the same critter - that &#39;Mega Gallade&#39; means it starts out as Gallade (Curufin), and then transforms on its first turn into Mega Gallade (Celegorm). It makes him stronger and prettier, and more susceptible to cunning Doriathrin princesses. ^_^<br><br>That help?<br><br>hS</p>

            <p><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/Houndoom.png"><br><br>((What, no chart?))<br><br>I showed them the chart to let them know I was doing it. I&#39;m not showing them the rest so as to avoid sharing my planning with them.<br><br>((Fair enough.))<br><br>So, is this one of the ones that upgrades itself on the fly?<br><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/MegaHoundoom.png"><br><br>I see that it is. I guess that&#39;s supposed to be a hellhound, but it&#39;s not a patch on the real thing. Ooh, it&#39;s got horns and a forked tail? I&#39;ve fought the kind the size of horses, with venomous fangs and enough strength to rip your arm clean off. And when I say &#39;fought&#39;, I mean &#39;fought and killed entire packs at once&#39;.<br><br>Still, I&#39;ll give them credit for effort, and call this one Draugluin.<br><br>Desdendelle&#39;s monsters mostly share weaknesses to Rock, Ground, and Water; we don&#39;t have Water, but Salgant can hit the other two. Unfortunately, Salgant is also <i>weak</i> against Draugluin - he can&#39;t abide Grass or Fighting. Which sounds a lot like Turgon&#39;s thane, actually.<br><br>Hmm, not rising to that one? I&#39;ll have to try harder. The best thing to do looks like sending in Aglon to punch it. Because once again, if you want something done, send House Feanor to do it.<br><br>... <i>still</i> no reaction? Maybe he&#39;s ill.<br><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/Arcanine.png"><br><br>Ah, another hellhound. This one can be Carcharoth. It looks about as much of a pushover as he should have been. Except, oh, wait - some mortal idiot literally <i>fed</i> him a Silmaril. I suppose we shouldn&#39;t ask too much of someone who let a King of the Noldor get eaten by werewolves - or of the supposed King who let himself be eaten...<br><br>((--!))<br><br>Ah. There it is.<br><br>So Carcharoth can&#39;t hit us very well unless we&#39;re silly enough to send in Iris. Equally, we can&#39;t do much to <i>him</i>. Salgant of course can hit him handily - and is immune to his electric attack which probably comes from the Silmaril - but apart from that, it&#39;s mostly Raumo, Aglon or Sauron getting in general-purpose normal hits of various kinds.<br><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/Ninetails.png"><br><br>A<i>nother</i> hellhound? Theme much? Hrm. Since the many tails-which-get-in-the-way make it look like there&#39;s more than one, let&#39;s call it Gaurhoth. Much though I hate to use that debased language, Sindarin has a good word for this.<br><br>Oh, I haven&#39;t prodded him yet. Er... and the fact that it&#39;s so small and unassuming shows you exactly how non-threatening the Gaurhoth were to competent warriors?<br><br>((Not gonna swing that one, I&#39;m afraid.))<br><br>Drat. So Gaurhoth shares Carcharoth&#39;s weaknesses, but can hit different types. Since it can attack out Ghost weakness, we&#39;ll want to send in Raumo, who&#39;s immune to that. Of course Raumo can&#39;t really hit well at all, but maybe he can get in one hit and throw up a Substitute, then switch out for someone who can, like Aglon.<br><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/Talonflame.png"><br><br>Everlasting Dark, it&#39;s not a dog. But it is just a bird; Morgoth didn&#39;t really use birds.<br><br>((Wait, you&#39;re theming your nicknames?))<br><br>Of course. No, Morgoth used metal-clad dragons and the like, not those silly eagles Manwe so enjoyed employing.<br><br>((One of those eagles saved your brother&#39;s life.))<br><br>For a few hundred years. Not really worth it, was it? So, a dragon. With a colour scheme like that, let&#39;s call it Glaurung.<br><br>((Glaurung couldn&#39;t fly.))<br><br>He didn&#39;t need to to smash up a certain hole in the ground.<br><br>((...))<br><br>That&#39;s what I thought. Glaurung is super weak to Salgant&#39;s moves, so that&#39;s what we&#39;re going with. Next.<br><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/Darmanitan.png"><br><br>What. Is that.<br><br>It looks like a mortal who&#39;s had too much Dorwinion wine.<br><br>I&#39;m going to call it Uldor the Accursed. And then I&#39;m going to kill it.<br><br>((Whoa! You can&#39;t go killing other people&#39;s Pokemon.))<br><br>Can I not? I still know how to wield a sword, you know.<br><br>((Dafydd, it&#39;s not <i>actually</i> Uldor.))<br><br>I know. Because I killed him.<br><br>... ugh, fine. Same type as Carcharoth and Gaurhoth, and I&#39;m going to let Aglon hit it to death because this fight needs a Feanorion. NEXT!<br><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/Pyroar.png"><br><br>... that&#39;s cheating.<br><br>((I think there&#39;s two different kinds.))<br><br>Oh. Hrm. Well, it&#39;s a cat... did I use Tevildo?<br><br>((You ended up calling him Sauron.))<br><br>This one can be Tevildo, then. Rounding out Team: Morgoth&#39;s Greatest Hits. And he&#39;s weak to Salgant or Aglon, so let&#39;s go with punching him again. NEXT!<br><br>((I think that&#39;s it.))<br><br>Oh. Listen, I&#39;m sure someone said Psychic is the best type, but we&#39;re not doing all that well in these fights. I&#39;d go so far as to say that my inspired leadership is the only thing rescuing us from extinction.<br><br>((I&#39;m sure you would. Psychic is good because it&#39;s not weak to much, I think, and didn&#39;t used to be weak to anything with actual damaging moves.))<br><br>So... you&#39;re saying it&#39;s like hiding in a hole in the ground and then crowing over your superiority because the enemy can&#39;t actually find you?<br><br>((...))<br><br>I&#39;ll take that as a yes. Suits you, then.<br><br>&gt;Dafydd Illian<br>((Ugh. So if anyone else wants one of these, let me know. ~hS))</p>

            <p><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/hSIxMatch.png"><br><br>((... that is not a Pokemon.))<br><br>No, it isn&#39;t. It&#39;s a sensible, organised way of discussing this. Not that that would occur to you Finarfinians, but <i>some</i> of us come from Houses that make <i>plans</i>.<br><br>((...))<br><br>The chart shows that we&#39;re somewhat out of luck here. Team Iximaz have five crippling weaknesses - Fire, Ice, Poison, Flying, and Bug. But as our team markers on the bottom show, we outright can&#39;t touch three of those, and one of the others - Poison - we only have one move for. We <i>can</i> hit Fire, so Aglon and Iris will be getting a major workout in this battle.<br><br>((You know we&#39;re not actually fighting, right?))<br><br>And whose fault is <i>that</i>? Roll the Pokedemons.<br><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/Venusaur.png"><br><br>Everlasting Dark! What <i>is</i> that? It looks like a mutant toad with a tree growing on it.<br><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/MegaVenusaur.png"><br><br>Well, at least it doesn&#39;t change when it &#39;Mega Evolves&#39;.<br><br>((Much as I&#39;d love to disagree with you... no, it kind of doesn&#39;t.))<br><br>So let&#39;s call it Sulimo, after someone <i>else</i> who didn&#39;t change even when he should have. As my chart shows, Sulimo here is vulnerable to both Fire and Psychic. That latter means most of our team can take him on; if we look at <i>his</i> moves, we see that he&#39;ll have a seriously hard time hitting Iris, so in goes the Rainbow Goddess. Next!<br><br>((That was almost a reasoned discussion. You&#39;re going to get a reputation if you keep going like this.))<br><br>I said NEXT!<br><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/Breloom.png"><br><br>... it&#39;s a lizard with a mushroom stuck on its head. So it grew up in a cave? I&#39;m going to call it Felagund.<br><br>((HEY!))<br><br>Felagund is weak. To Psychic.<br><br>((Oh just <i>stop</i>.))<br><br>That gives us lots of options... but for thematic purposes, I&#39;m going to say use Sauron on him. I think we all know how that will end.<br><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/Leavanny.png"><br><br>Remind me, are these ones themed &#39;Cheerful Horror-type&#39;? Because that&#39;s terrifying. Though with that dancer pose, it reminds me of Melian... I&#39;m calling it Melian.<br><br>((Didn&#39;t you already pick on Queen Melian once?))<br><br>Many, many more times than once. Melian has a massive Fire weakness, and nothing terribly good against Iris, so the glorious rainbow of House Feanor once again beats the forest-dwelling dancer.<br><br>((... are you seriously <i>bragging</i> about the Second Kinslaying?))<br><br>... I was thinking of something else, I promise.<br><br>((Uh-huh.))<br><br>You&#39;re right; if that was the point I was making, it would have been an awful one.<br><br>((Should I tell your wife about this?))<br><br>Let&#39;s just move on.<br><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/Lilligant.png"><br><br>...<br><br>OH COME ON. I <b>just</b> used up my Melian reference! This one even has a crown! Can I go back and change it?<br><br>((Nope. You burned that ship behind you...))<br><br>Go jump off an iceberg. <b>Fine</b>. I&#39;m calling this one Finarfin.<br><br>((... why...?))<br><br>To irritate you. Finarfin is a weakling pansy who runs away all the time--<br><br>((Dafydd...))<br><br>-- and is weak to the same things as everyone else. Since all he can hit with is Grass, let&#39;s mix things up and send in Arnyelle to poison him to death.<br><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/Exeggutor.png"><br><br>That&#39;s a tree.<br><br>((So was &#39;Finarfin&#39;.))<br><br>No, he was a useless coward. This is a genuine tree. I think Cirdan grew them down at Eglarest. So let&#39;s call it-<br><br>((Cirdan?))<br><br>No, Hirilorn. Because it&#39;s so... &#39;majestic&#39;.<br><br>((My patience is seriously wearing thin.))<br><br>My caring ran out a long time ago. Hirilorn is... hey, Psychic is <b>our</b> gimmick! Figures the Queen of Trees would steal from us, just like the Queen of Doriath stole our glory.<br><br>((You mean by being actually capable of defending her realm?))<br><br>Yes, that. We can either use Sauron against Hirilorn to hit a Ghost weakness, or go back to Iris and Fire on the grounds that Hirilorn can&#39;t really touch her.<br><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/Gogoat.png"><br><br>And that... is just a goat.<br><br>((You&#39;re still going to give it an offensive name, though.))<br><br>What gave you that impression? I was going to name it after one of my tough, mountain-bred horses.<br><br>((Oh, well, that&#39;s--))<br><br>But if you&#39;d prefer offensive, I&#39;ll call it Turin, after yet another scruffy mortal.<br><br>... what, no objection?<br><br>((Yeah, I&#39;m not too fond of Turin myself. Remember what he did to Nargothrond?))<br><br>... is it too late to change it?<br><br>((Yes.))<br><br>Bother. Well, Turin is virtually identical to Finarfin - they were both useless cowards who got their own people killed -<br><br>((HEY!))<br><br>Heh, gotcha - except that he could hit Arnyelle&#39;s weakness if he wanted.<br><br>So we&#39;ll just send in Aglon to punch him on fire. Problem solved!<br><br>&gt;Dafydd Illian<br> </p>

            <p>For you Canadians, it all started in 1872, when the hard working men (no women at the time as far as I can tell) of the Toronto Typographical Union&#39;s marched and went on strike for a 58-hour work-week. This was he major start of the labor movement in Canada. While inspired by the American labor movement, they did a lot of hard fighting of their own that earns my respect.

            <p>The fic I&#39;m thinking of is the only one in the &quot;Watership Down&quot; section, called &quot;The Great Journey.&quot; I took a look at it and just did a headdesk. For example: there&#39;s a bit character named after the sun god of canon, the creator of the world in rabbit legend. That&#39;s a HUGE no-no!<br><br>The only problem is that the characters that would be Stus don&#39;t seem to have enough marks against them for acting like Stus.

            <p>Cowrites depend on what program you use to do them. Generally it&#39;s helpful to have a chat and a doc. Google Docs tend to work very well, since you can see what the other person is writing and have a chat (which doesn&#39;t save, be warned) on the side. You can also email a document back and forth, or write a draft by chat, or write it by email. Whatever works best for you and the person you&#39;re writing with. Most of the cowrites I&#39;ve done have used Google Docs, although Lily Winterwood and I wrote half of a story on Tumble (unpublished, there was something else we wanted to finish first), and Karen DuLay and I actually rped part of a mission (which we&#39;re now rewriting), also on Tumblr, which was very fun but a little more difficult once we got to the mission part of it. Karen and I communicated via tags and sometimes in the gmail chat.<br><br>Seriously, though--it&#39;s whatever works. There&#39;s no one way to do this, and there&#39;s certainly no wrong way to do it.<br><br>Most importantly, of course--have fun :) Writing with other people can be great for learning, for having fun, and for something else that&#39;s escaping me right now; enjoy it :)<br><br>~DF</p>

            <p>Which is a shame; I should reread it again sometime soonish. I like it a lot. I&#39;m not sure I remember enough to properly do a mission there, though, although I could be wrong.<br><br>As for the not-Stus--they can probably be left to assimilate into canon, since they&#39;re, well, not Stus. If there are severely OOC characters around them, that would be good--exorcism and probably neuralyzing would set the canon back to rights. Without that...I can&#39;t quite remember how it&#39;d work. There&#39;s generally something that has to be charged and changed by the agents.<br><br>Essentially: I&#39;m interested in cowriting with you, but...I don&#39;t know that I&#39;d be anything but a hindrance with this one. I remember the general plot and general world details of Watership Down, but I can barely remember the characters&#39; names and doubt I could provide much insight for mischaracterization except when it comes to Fiver and...whoever the other main characters are. That&#39;s the only name I remember at the moment.<br><br>~DF</p>

            <p>I&#39;ll just need your emails, please, so I can share it via Doc. Also, please don&#39;t have your characters swear Earth-style.

So the more the merrier, especially with rabbits. &quot;We mustn&#39;t straggle too widely, must stick together.&quot; There aren&#39;t any canon characters, except taking sweet little Pipkin and making him into less than a bit character and possibly OOC (WHY, INLERAH, MUST YOU DO THIS TO HIM?!

            <p>About the swear words, I don&#39;t like my agents to use any language stronger than you&#39;d normally expect for the continuum being protected (just in case there&#39;s a risk their swearing could damage a continuum that wouldn&#39;t normally have it.)  How would you feel about agents saying Lapine swear-words like &quot;hraka&quot; or &quot;embleer&quot;?  Does that count as swearing &quot;Earth-style&quot; since rabbits are from (an) Earth?  Or is it allowed as being canonical?<br><br>Anyway, email me at <b>pippa dot moran at gmail dot com</b>.<br></p>

            <p>(Please hold off on the pokeballs.  I&#39;ve brought a casserole?)<br><br>Shorah!  Hmm, how to introduce... well, my handle&#39;s Schism, and I&#39;ve been a reader of the PPC for about two years now!  Went back through the Original Series and shotgunned the whole thing (alongside a few drinks for the sheer insanity of the Sues who were sporked), and I&#39;ve been bringing myself through the trials and tribulations of assorted agents ever since.<br><br>In fandom terms, I&#39;ve got quite a lot on my list: primarily, I do of course have the old standbys of Discworld, Doctor Who, H2G2 and the Lord of the Rings, but alongside that, I&#39;m pretty well acquainted with David Weber&#39;s &#39;Safehold&#39;, the Dresden Files, much of Piers Anthony&#39;s work, MYST, and a smattering of other canons.  I&#39;m better versed in the literary aspects than film and TV, though some anime and manga is also on my list.<br><br>In terms of favourite agents, I&#39;d have to say that Desdendelle, The Reader, Rina--er, I mean, the Aviator, and Zeb top the list right now, not least because of the nine kinds of pain they&#39;ve gone through; sorry, writers, but their pain amuses me.<br><br>And last but not least, if I have a potential superpower, it&#39;s the ability to inspire hunger at a range of 50 paces, as you can see here with this zucchini, eggplant and chicken casserole with a spicy tomato sauce.<br><br>A pleasure to meet you all, and I hope to hang out here quite a bit!</p>

            <p>Hmmm, favourite character within the Lord of the Rings?  Well, the one who stands out for me would have to be Saruman, whose temptation, rise to power, fall from grace, and ultimate humiliation in the Shire was an excellent microcosm of Sauron&#39;s followers.<br><br>-Schism</p>

            <p>Okay, so this was indeed a &#39;bit later&#39;. I wanted to let the chaos threads get a bit farther before putting this up, but now seems like a good time. (That whole night of the server going down didn&#39;t precisely help, either.)<br><br>Again, a quick breakdown of the rules:<br><br>1. First and foremost, if you&#39;re going to do anything potentially serious or even permanent to the bodies that your character is inhabiting for the duration of the event, please make sure to clear it with said character&#39;s writer. Besides seriously injuring them or even killing them, this also includes things like, say, giving them haircuts or permanently changing their species. <br><br>2. Following that first part, no godmoding/power-playing! Control your own characters and your own characters only. <br> <br>3. Suprise! Unlike the Chaos threads, this one will feature yours truly doing some GMing! In the event that I am no longer available, Huinesoron has volunteered to help out there. I (or our resident elf guy) will occasionally drop in when a group hits onto a clue as to where the device could be. For those who like to live the wild life, feel free to <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_Wo_f3L-EcIafY4xyrbuhduf1yjaF8Za1m2wICoeaZc/edit?usp=sharing">roll for something happening</a> as well.<br><br>To make it clear, the device hunt itself does <i>not</i> immediately lead to a &#39;hurrah this is all fixed thank god&#39;. That said, HST timewise, the event itself has already ended as of the third of September.<br><br>Cheers and good hunting! </p>

No need to thank us, it&#39;s his fault anyway.&quot;<br><br>&quot;It was <i>not</i> my-&quot; The second head didn&#39;t get any further, as the body swung an arm up to cover its mouth.

This is Jareth; he&#39;s a decent tracker. We heard you were planning to hunt down that missing machine that caused all this?&quot;<br><br>Salamander shrugged. &quot;<i>Someone</i> has to,&quot; he said. &quot;And my partner-&quot;<br><br>&quot;Kaaaaayleeeeeigh to the rescue!&quot; Sal ducked as Kayleigh swooped by overhead, hanging by her hands from a hoverboard. &quot;Have at thee, foul beas- oh, it&#39;s goooo-oof.&quot;<br><br>The board came to a hard stop against the wall, and Kayleigh dropped down. She jogged across the wet floor to Salamander and waved.<br><br>&quot;Wa- oh, sorry, I keep forgetting. Sorry I took so long, I had to get changed.&quot;<br><br>Salamander looked at her bikini and shook his head. &quot;You didn&#39;t-&quot; He frowned. &quot;Wait, how did <i>that</i> take a long time? You were wearing a bikini already!&quot;<br><br>&quot;But that was my <i>sunbathing</i> bikini,&quot; she said. &quot;This is my <i>monster-fighting</i> bikini. See?&quot;<br><br>Kyaris tried to exchange a look with Jareth, but he was too busy glaring. &quot;Right,&quot; she said instead, &quot;okay. So do you actually have any ideas how to find this thing?&quot; She looked around the bedraggled cafeteria. &quot;Does anyone?&quot;<br><br>~<br><br>((Happy for anyone to jump on-board here.))<br><br>((hS))</p>

Still, the game was a fun way of passing time now the current body swap crisis seemed to have reduced the number of missions being sent to agents.  &quot;Look, I&#39;m going out for lunch.  We can continue the game when I get back.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Going out?&quot; asked Sean.  &quot;Are you sure?  We can get Gieves to microwave something out of the fridge and eat it here.&quot;<br><br>The mini-Jeeves gave the definite impression of almost, but not quite, tutting at that suggestion.<br><br>&quot;Quite sure, thanks.  I want to ask people for names of <i>recent </i>films.&quot;  She walked over to the console, and tapped a few buttons.  The Generic Woman was immediately replaced with a blue unicorn stallion.<br><br>In the days following the swap, a sort-of etiquette had arisen amongst the swapped agents.  It was bad form to walk around HQ in a borrowed body while in a disguise.    People liked to recognise their bodies and see what was being done with them.  Agents could, and did, disguise themselves in their own RC for comfort, but always dropped the disguise when going out in public.  Not everyone followed this, of course, but many did.<br><br>After she&#39;d gone, Sean turned to Gieves.  &quot;I don&#39;t suppose you&#39;d be interested in a game?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I regret, sir, that it was young Mr Wooster, not I, who frequented the cinematograph.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Oh, right.&quot;<br><br>A few moments of awkward silence, then:<br><br>&quot;Oh, **** it.  I&#39;ll go out too.&quot;<br><br>Soon, the Generic Man had turned back into a hydra, and headed off.<br><br><hr>
<br><br>In the corridors, Hild was distracting herself with seeing how well she could switch between trotting and cantering.  Suddenly, something even more distracting came heading towards her: a scantily clad woman on a flying board.<br></p>

            <p>Jareth smiled back at Hild, but Kyaris was already talking.<br><br>&quot;I know what he means - well, obviously. One of the heads I picked up during the Invasion is particularly prone to headaches - I&#39;ve honestly considered tearing it off, except I&#39;m worried the replacements would both be as- oops, here she comes.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yay! You gave me a nickname!&quot; Kayleigh bounced over to Hild and hugged her around the neck. &quot;Now we are best friends! Or at least friends! Or acquaintances!&quot;<br><br>Salamander coughed. &quot;Kayleigh? You&#39;re hugging again.&quot;<br><br>&quot;What? Oh.&quot; Kayleigh took a step back. &quot;I-am-aware-that-some-people-don&#39;t-like-hugs-so-I&#39;m-sorry,&quot; she rattled off. &quot;Now, where was I?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Babbling on about aromatherapy,&quot; Kyaris supplied. &quot;I think we should really be tracking down the Sub Rosa, though-&quot;<br><br>Kayleigh cut her off with a glare, hefting her mace. &quot;We&#39;re looking for the aromatherapist,&quot; she said. Then she beamed. &quot;So! Agent Horse, you keep your nose open for revitalizing essential oils. Agent Seeing Colours-&quot;<br><br>&quot;His name&#39;s Yoof,&quot; Salamander supplied.<br><br>&quot;<b>Agent Seeing Colours,</b> you look out for her pink highlights. Agent Four Ears-&quot;<br><br>&quot;Is that meant to be us?&quot; Jareth growled. &quot;We are <i>two</i> agents, and I for one don&#39;t think-&quot;<br><br>&quot;That&#39;s a shame; you should really try it.&quot; Kayleigh flipped her hoverboard back into the air and climbed aboard. &quot;Agents Fours Earses, you listen out for uplifting slogans. And Sal... I&#39;ll call you if I need anyone to taste or touch something, all right?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I have no idea what you&#39;re going on about.&quot;<br><br>&quot;That&#39;s the spirit!&quot; Kayleigh stood up and pressed down with her toe; the hoverboard began to pick up speed. &quot;Onwaaaaards!&quot;<br><br>~<br><br>((So: yes, Kayleigh does actually have a plan. My theory is that until July drops in to GM us, we&#39;ll invent our own trail of clues to follow. And this is the first one! Shout out when you smell/see/etc the aromatherapist - and bonus points if you can guess who I&#39;m bringing back for this. ^_^))<br><br>((I&#39;m dropping my theory about the Sub Rosa here - basically, she&#39;s not one to let an opportunity go to waste, so while the rest of HQ&#39;s in chaos and the Flowers are flailing around, she&#39;s wandering around undercover, pretending to be a human agent. No doubt she&#39;ll learn many things people would rather she hadn&#39;t.))<br><br>((Jareth is... well, since Rath never said, I&#39;m going to go with Isengard.

So why had this Kayleigh been so keen on everyone finding her?<br><br>Wanting to find out more, but unable to think of any better way of opening the conversation, Hild asked: &quot;Uh, do you have anything that would help a very stressed Hydra body to relax?&quot;<br><br><hr>
<br><br>((BTW I&#39;m assuming Hild can&#39;t use a Reality Room or something like that to stabilise her past, as Agent Derik did, because removing the inconsistencies would also mean removing the plothole she fell through into HQ.  She would die in her origin fic and never have joined the PPC.))<br></p>

            <p>&quot;No, wait, not a well. You know how we&#39;ve all had out bodies swapped?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Er, you haven&#39;t,&quot; bjam pointed out.<br><br>&quot;Obviously not <i>me</i> we, but in a spiritual sense, I&#39;m totally right there with you.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Er. Right.&quot; Bjam half-turned towards the funny-talking man inspecting her stall, and put on her game face. &quot;Hi! It&#39;s funny you should say that - many of the flavours I sell are actually inspired by edibles. I have both essential and irrelevant oils of lemon, mint, and beef, scented candles in chocolate, raspberry, and cookie, and incense in bear, strawberry, and I-can&#39;t-believe-it&#39;s-not-cannabis.<br><br>&quot;For stress in carnivores,&quot; she went on, making eye contact with the hydra head that had spoken, &quot;I recommend my special Double Marrow Infusion. That&#39;s bone marrow and marrow-the-vegetable. Sprinkle some in a bowl of hot water and inhale...&quot; She paused, frowned, looking at the hydra&#39;s eight heads. &quot;You might need rather a lot.&quot;<br><br><hr>
<br><br>((I once bought some scented melting-wax things in cookie flavour. They&#39;re amazing. I also have what&#39;re claimed to be opium-flavour incense sticks, for... some reason.<br><br>((I&#39;ll get Kayleigh to ask questions again next time, unless something comes up.<br><br>((I&#39;m sorry for taking so long to reply here! Yikes, I didn&#39;t even realise how long it had been...<br><br>((Pippa: does Hild drink? Because for the past few days I&#39;ve had this vision of the three Isengarders getting utterly plastered together and singing Isengard-themed songs at the top of their lungs. I can imagine a rousing chorus of Treebeard&#39;s song - &quot;#TO ISENGARD! Though ISENGARD be STRONG and HARD...#&quot;, followed of course by Maethorwen doing a gorgeous soprano version of &#39;They&#39;re taking the Hobbits to Isengard&#39;... &gt;:D<br><br>((hS))</p>

So, let&#39;s see, where were we?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Complementing me,&quot; bjam supplied, handing Yoof a business card (a miniature sign with &#39;Go PPC Aromatherapy&#39; on it). &quot;Which means you&#39;re about to ask me for something.&quot;<br><br>&quot;How did you know?

Well, right after the swap happened, I was singing encouraging ditties outside the Cafeteria, and this group of DoSAT techs ran past... they were babbling something about field strengths and dropoffs, I didn&#39;t really understand, but it sounded... important.

Forgot who I was talking to, there.&quot;<br><br>~<br><br>Why the FofB? I just like it :P.

            <p>Monday. I wanted us to skip ahead to Eagrus&#39;s RC and let him get some gear. Then, we rest, and start our adventure from there. It seemed reasonable for a time-break, let our guys get prepared before potential Sue attacks or whatever other nonsense July could throw at us.<br><br>Still, HQ being HQ, time matters little. We could meet up with other hunting parties too. Probably will stay separate on the whole for everybody&#39;s sanity, but a few lines of interaction is never a bad thing.</p>

            <p>Yes, yes, another thread from July, but I&#39;m making this one separate from the other for the main reason that it&#39;s a whole &#39;nother kettle of fish! In fact, it&#39;s not fish at all! Not a kettle, either! <br><br>It&#39;s boarders!<br><br>For those of you going &#39;but what is this&#39;, the Census is a thing I&#39;ve cooked up yearly (with a couple year gap) since 2009 to get an idea of what our demographics are!<br><br>For instance, here&#39;s the <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1gW5u9U6iu8O6Dwu-Y6kLAs1Z82X7oFEYXqLUEuwRDko/viewanalytics">summary</a> of last year&#39;s census, and the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19_LyUhLLyt8qwUYoM1hzR5Hbf_iesa7oIF9gSlQA_ME/edit?usp=sharing"> spreadsheet</a> with a more detailed view. <br><br>What&#39;s the point of this, exactly, you might be asking? Well, you&#39;ve seen the above from 2014, now, right?<br><br><a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1aZ259bv_EsS5WH5Dp2-8XRethMIjCJ9IYITDonERgdw/viewanalytics">Here&#39;s</a> the original census&#39; summary from <i>2009</i>. Back then, the board was overwhelmingly female! It wasn&#39;t until the PPC&#39;s inclusion on TvTropes that it slowly began to pick up more and more males!<br><br>As ever, the census is an evolving thing, and responses and suggestions for this year&#39;s will be taken into mind for next year&#39;s- 2016! <br><br><a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1bqF5uz1ZVJI8JJUZx9J-0IaWiVxU3GFp2gUie_vEGq4/viewform">Fill the census out here</a>.</p>

            <p>First off, we are talking a hot drink in this case.  You&#39;ll want to start with a cap full (if your whiskey is sans cap, you can use a teaspoon to start) in a regular mug of tea.  Start light on the whiskey and add until you like the balance.  The goal is not a strong drink.  Rather, the tea and whiskey should coexist peacefully, with the whiskey adding a warming sensation and some flavor.<br><br>As for procedure, I like to put the whiskey in the cup first (and any other flavorings like honey or lemon {all three together are delicious in the right combination}) and pour the hot liquid over it.<br><br>Phobos, Mixologist?</p>

            <p>Just be aware that even if I do end up trying again, I can&#39;t exactly get rid of some of the things that make my writing a bit difficult to deal with (being so focused on characters and how they interact), so a few serious moments are inevitable, but I&#39;ll try to avoid having too much of them.<br><br>For example : If one of my two agents gets the other into a really bad (read: life threatening) situation by accident, they will talk about it at the end, but the serious stuff won&#39;t be brought up constantly. <br><br>Of course, a bit of help might be needed to get there, but...</p>

            <p>Welcome to the ranks. We hope you enjoy yourself here, where sanity and normalcy are highly valued. *barely concealed psychotic giggle*<br><br>But seriously, it&#39;s good to have you here. The college life can be difficult, I feel you. I&#39;m a Sophomore myself, and my education is probably why I haven&#39;t managed to procure myself Permission yet. I&#39;ve been devoting myself to my studies. But time management is key, obviously. When it comes time for actually doing the work, stay on top of it, and you&#39;ll have plenty of time to unwind and go crazy with us, so to speak (*giggles again*).<br><br>Once again, welcome to the PPC! It&#39;s customary for PPC members to give newbies &quot;gifts,&quot; (even though they&#39;re not real gifts, they&#39;re little lines of text on a computer). I however, have never given anyone anything, because I haven&#39;t had the opportunity.<br><br>Nevertheless, here&#39;s a, uhhhhhhhhh... Shoe Umbrellas! They&#39;re tiny, red-and-white-striped umbrellas you can attach to your shoes so that your feet don&#39;t get wet when it&#39;s raining. I don&#39;t know why someone invented these, but they&#39;re honestly the best I have at the moment. (I&#39;m poor! I&#39;m a College student, after all.)<br><br>Semper erit insanus!</p>

            <p>Sort of like that. It can change into any book (or fic for that matter) in existence. The exact way it works is kind of like the <a href="http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Room_of_Requirement">Room of Requiriment</a>. Basically, just hold it, close your eyes and think of the text you wanna read and then blink on purpose three times and it should have changed.  </p>

I don&#39;t plan on starting right away, of course, but I&#39;m already thinking up a few things, and it might be a pretty interesting quirk to use the Rorschach Book instead of actually go get a canon book for a ritual.<br><br>Then again, the current character I have is an Eevee named Lucky who due to his introduction to the PPC (his death in a Wonderlocke causing the cancellation of a Wonderlocke comic where he was a main character, and said comic&#39;s cancellation causing a rather large plothole that manages to send pre-death Lucky to the PPC) is extremely unlucky due to a sort of &quot;karmic debt&quot; thingie.

            <p>Though the Rorschach Book thing is currently just a Boarder thing. Currently it does not exist in the PPC Canon and I don&#39;t know if others would agree on it being implemented as such. If it were to be included in an actual PPC story however, you could just have it that is publically available like other PPC items, thus bypassing the luck issue.</p>

            <p>...and such a &quot;publicly available&quot; option, combined with drawbacks (i.e. not being able to reproduce non-written works like TV and video games, being a bit less useful in exorcism due to an as-of-yet unconfirmed vulnerability to suefluence, ect.) that explain its non-use compared to digital options or actual books, mean it&#39;s pretty much perfect for agents like Lucky.<br><br>Being cosmically and dismally unlucky means he might not be able to get ahold of the original versions due to demand and usage by everyone else in the PPC, and it also means it&#39;d be impossible for him to use electronic options without breaking them. He thus has to resort to what may seem like an OP item like first but is quickly revealed to be a last-resort item shoved into the back of every other Agent&#39;s inventory, forgotten.</p>

It&#39;s a pretty cool item, but Delcatty is <i>terrible</i> - and it definitely doesn&#39;t have the bulk to use any Breath effectively. If you must, go for a Bold with Wonder Skin, Super Train the thing in Defence and HP, and give it Substitute, Calm Mind, Hyper Voice and Baton Pass.

            <p>You have a point, but I was more thinking the canon games where one WOULD need to find more.<br><br>I personally have a Showdown loadout involving a Hitmonlee with Unburden, Fake-Out, and a Normal Gem. Fake-Out destroys Normal Gem, and boosts the attack, but its true useage is triggering Unburden for a speed boost. Said loadout gets expensive in the canon games, as you need to get a new Normal Gem with each battle.</p>

            <p>Not only do you get the speed boost, but you also have Fake-Out itself, a 100% chance for flinching. You are kinda screwed if you don&#39;t get it off first move, but the bonus is not only a boost to speed if you get it right, but also depriving your opponent of whatever move they were going to lead with.</p>

            <p>However, Talonflame is without question the better &#39;mon in competitive - and the set I listed earlier is something of a nerf, since it removes Roost. Fake Out is good, yeah (I like Technician Ambipom for that) but it forces your mon into a particular role, one for which Hitmonlee is, er... ill-suited. Too fragile, too low of a base speed even with Unburden&#39;s boost, and it has other, better options. When I see Hitmonlee (I play in its home tier of RarelyUsed) it tends to run Reckless with a Life Orb. Things die. A lot. =]</p>

            <p>The thing about using Fake Out, though, is that it has to be a fairly strong Fake Out to begin with - you want to maximise the free damage you&#39;re getting. That&#39;s why I like Ambipom for it; STAB Technician LO-boosted Fake Out is almost, but not quite, a useful move. Add on Return, Knock Off, and Low Kick for coverage, and you have a usable mon, if a very fragile one. =]</p>

            <p>The Fake Out and Normal Gem serve two purposes here- not only for Fake-Out&#39;s usual purpose (free damage boosted by Normal Gem and disarming setup moves, which is why I send out Hitmonlee first), but also for the Unburden speed boost. After the Fake Out, I have Close Combat and Hi Jump Kick for two choices of STAB moves (one with the downside being making a fragile &#39;mon even more fragile, the other with the possibility of miss=recoil), and Blaze Kick as an option for Super Effective against certain types.</p>

            <p>I know I just introduced myself- in the last thread, even- but I wanted to go ahead and run my first Agent by you guys for what you thought of him. <br><br>Agent Lucky M. Foot<br>Home Continuum: Pokemon<br>Home Fic: &quot;Pokemon Omega Ruby Wonderlocke: The Spirit of Discord&quot;<br>Species: Lv. 21 Eevee<br>Traits: Severe karmic debt, can be clumsy, quick to panic<br>Department: Floaters<br><br>Backstory: Lucky started life as an unnamed Eevee was born to an IV breeding competitive trainer in a World One copy of Pokemon Alpha Sapphire. He was rejected and Wonder-traded away to a copy of Omega Ruby used as the actual-playthrough-of-Pokemon counterpart of a regularly-updated comic. The trainer got quite attached to him, treating the Eevee&#39;s comic counterpart- named &quot;Dirtcheap&quot; as a dig on his previous trainer possibly thinking him worthless- as practically a second protagonist.<br><br>Then, the Eevee in the actual copy of Omega Ruby died to a unexpected, critical-hit Drill Peck while grinding. Unable to both deal with the grief and think up how a simple training accident killing off such an important character to the plot of his story, the author instead ended the comic abruptly with little more than a hasty apology, blaming unrelated issues to his choice to not continue the comic.<br><br>To the comic&#39;s Dirtcheap, this amounted to the Drill Peck drilling a plothole straight into his chest, sucking him in as his Word World collapsed around him. After drifting through a void for five minutes in stunned silence, he landed in the halls of the PPC, right on top of a rather shocked Gallifreyan. About then is when his chest finally started bleeding.<br><br>And badly.<br><br>Luckily he was about five minutes from Medical. After patching him up, fitting him with a Universal Translator collar, and a rather long stay in FicPsych to deal with the mental scarring of not just the near-death experience but also the Wonderlocke story itself (losing friends left and right, one by one, after implied neglect and abandonment by a trainer, is not healthy to any brain), &quot;Dirtcheap&quot;- renamed Lucky- joined the Department of Floaters, and was assigned to an RA with its walls... an eye-assaulting shade of blello.<br><br>Current Situation: Like other recruits that were supposed to die in their home fic, Karma is not on his side due to his absolutely huge karmic debt. This is pretty well reflected in his name, reflecting the old &quot;Lucky the Dog&quot; urban legend- of that one stray dog hanging around that lost an eye, a leg, his nuts, an ear, his tail, et cetera, but still has his life. As such, he&#39;s very, VERY shiny to the Ironic Overpower, who absolutely loves to treat him as a brand new chew toy.<br><br>As such, Lucky opts not to use high-tech equipment in favor of equipment that can take the inevitable beating it will receive at the hands of bad luck and bad-luck-induced clumsiness. He leaves the C-CAD and RA with his partner, in favor of litmus strips, and carries around a Rorschach Book- a book that can take the appearance and contents of any text the user deems to be needed, Room of Requirement-style. (Unfortunately said &quot;user&quot; can include Sues in passing and &quot;texts&quot; can include badfic, making it almost useless for exorcism. This is why practically every other agent uses the Canon Library, which Lucky is banned from due to a mishap with a set of Harry Potter books and a passing janitor&#39;s bucket of water.)<br><br>However, Lucky does have one rather important piece of technology with him- his Universal Translator, which is almost always on the fritz. As such, he can seem to be hard of hearing and can sometimes spout off what seems to be non-sequiturs but are in fact mistranslations. Other times it might simply sound like what he says was put through Google Translate twenty times, a symptom that he probably has with his hearing if his occasional confused looks are anything to go by. He may even be forced to slip into another language entirely, especially with curse words.</p>

            <p>Agent Poppy Seed<br>Home Continuum: Pokemon<br>Home Fic: &quot;Pokemon Omega Ruby Wonderlocke: The Spirit of Discord&quot;<br>Species: Lv. 21 Eevee<br>Gender: Female<br>Nature: Timid<br>Department: Floaters<br>Notes: Quite a bit clumsy.<br><br>Backstory: Poppy started life as an unnamed Eevee that was born to an IV breeding competitive trainer in a World One copy of Pokemon Alpha Sapphire. She was rejected and Wonder-traded away to a copy of Omega Ruby used as the actual-playthrough-of-Pokemon counterpart of a regularly-updated comic. The trainer got quite attached to her, treating the Eevee&#39;s comic counterpart- named &quot;Dirtcheap&quot; as a dig on his previous trainer possibly thinking her worthless- as practically a second protagonist.<br><br>Then, the trainer&#39;s starter in the actual copy of Omega Ruby died to a unexpected, critical-hit Drill Peck while grinding. Unable to both deal with the grief and think up how to handle a simple training accident killing off such an important character to the plot of his story, the author instead ended the comic abruptly with little more than a hasty apology, blaming unrelated issues to his choice to not continue the comic.<br><br>To the comic&#39;s Dirtcheap, this amounted to the Drill Peck drilling a plothole straight into the poor Slowpoke&#39;s chest, sucking her in as her Word World collapsed around him. After drifting through a void for five minutes in stunned, confused silence, he landed in the halls of the PPC, right on top of a rather shocked <s>Gallifreyan</s> Klingon.<br><br>After a stay in FicPsych, she was deemed at least sane enough to report for the Duty, and after a rename, she was recruited into the Department of Floaters.<br><br>Personality and Mental State: As her Timid nature indicates, Poppy is rather... er, let&#39;s call her <i>exciteable</i>. At the drop of a hat, she can be reduced to stunned, shivering silence behind or underneath a convenient nearby object by... pretty much anything, from a rather bloody scene to her own partner yelling in frustration. That&#39;s not to say she doesn&#39;t care for the Duty, of course- she can get pretty passionate about it, in fact. This usually ends up being what brings her out from under Generic Object Number Fourteen when on the job.<br><br>When not hiding behind or under random objects, Poppy is actually pretty caring. She&#39;s pretty protective of Minis, to the point of bordering on motherly. In fact, her Berserk Button turns out to be &quot;hurting any Mini in front of her.&quot;<br><br>Most of her current mental state probably stems from her rather traumatic exit from her world- being sucked into a small hole in the chest of a dead friend didn&#39;t go over well, plothole or not. It didn&#39;t help that said world had her friends die left, right, and center, as is usual in any Nuzlocke variant.</p>

            <p>Okay. To start off with:<br><br>This is a whole lotta what, but not much who. Those are traits, not a personality. This doesn&#39;t really tell us much about your would-be character and what they are like.<br><br>You give Lucky a pretty dire entry into the PPC. It&#39;s also very similar to the entry another Pokemon agent was given. And why the random Gallifreyan? We&#39;ve got a number of them at HQ (some of whom will probably be exasperated by another one showing up).<br><br>The Ironic Overpower loves chewing on everyone. <br><br>That said, the keeping of mind of litmus strips is clever.

While the idea might seem funny, in actuality it&#39;ll be annoying and distracting to read; Google Translate is quite rubbish for translations, and having to deal with gibberish and generally bad grammar from an agent character kind of goes against the point of things.</p>

            <p>Yeah... you&#39;re right. This kind of concept (dodge death = bad luck) was sorta copied from another PPC agent anyways, and I solidified so much of the &quot;what&quot; that there&#39;s simply not enough room for me to work with when figuring out the &quot;who&quot;.<br><br>Still like the idea of an Eevee agent, though, but definitely with a different backstory and current situation. The wonderlocke word-world fizzling part is definitely staying, as I like the idea too much, but the Eevee isn&#39;t the character that died. The current situation bit honestly made more negative natures like Lonely or Timid a bit too wangsty, and I honestly like the idea of a Timid nature the more I think about it... hm. An agent that&#39;s scared of his/her own partner (and everything else) to the point of hiding behind something when he/she yells, there&#39;s something to be had there...</p>

            <p>I honestly hadn&#39;t thought much about his personality, but it&#39;s definitely going to be based around his Nature. Not sure which one to give him yet, however.<br><br>I honestly didn&#39;t realize another Pokemon had a similar intro to the PPC, and thought I was being original. I do however want to play around with the whole &quot;Dodged death = very very unlucky&quot; bit. Also random Gallifreyan could easily be replaced with a Klingon or human or elf or... well, pretty much anything that there&#39;s a number of at HQ. It was just for the sake of detail.<br><br>The point of the Ironic Overpower bit is that it&#39;s unnaturally fond of toying with Lucky. Looking back on it, probably should remove that bit and just keep it with Karma/bad luck.<br><br>I should probably have gone with &quot;banned from checking out anything from&quot; instead of simply &quot;banned from&quot;, as that was my intent. He can&#39;t get anything from the Canon Library, no matter how nicely he asks the librarian.<br><br>As for the Universal Translator collar bit, it&#39;s not always on &quot;Google Translate 20 times over&quot;. Do notice that I said &quot;sometimes it&#39;s this, sometimes it&#39;s that, sometimes it&#39;s something completely different&quot;. I&#39;m never going to have him use bad grammar for the sake of bad grammar, nor am I always going to have him spout out non-sequiturs 24/7 instead of talk normally. He&#39;s going to be pretty normal, but <i>every once in a while</i> he&#39;ll say something and clap his paw over his mouth as it&#39;s not what he meant to say, or look confusedly at his partner because the translator ...ed up on his end.</p>

            <p>So, there is a series on hentai-foundry called Sex-arcade, and It&#39;s whole gimmick is that canon women are kidnapped, taken into the real world and forced into what amounts to white slavery. <br><br>  Now the question I was wondering is &quot;What would the PPC&#39;s stance on a company like this be?

            <p>No, It&#39;s mostly sex-slavery /forced prostitution. The girls are kidnapped from their home fandoms then bound and raped. Korra and  Toph are in the series so it has nothing to do with race.  </p>

            <p>Well, depending on the medium, it may depend less on SPaG. (For instance, video, where speech and visuals are simply given via audio and video, not the written word.)<br><br>As such, one would instead need to focus on errors more unique to that medium- say, glitches and scripting errors in video games, or animation errors in video.<br><br>In-universe for the PPC, one would probably need special equipment- for instance, a specially-modified crash dummy made to operate with remote control to take the place of the main character in a fangame.<br><br>It&#39;s relatively easy to spork nonwritten material.

Pokémon Go looks to follow in the footsteps of Ingress, letting players find virtual Pokémon and do battle in the real world, powered by GPS. Niantic broke away from Google after the Alphabet reorganization; Nintendo and The Pokémon Company are making a joint investment in the now independent company.<br><br>Nintendo is developing a companion smartwatch device called Pokémon Go Plus, designed to help you take part in the game&#39;s world without having to stare at your phone all day. The Pokéball-shaped device will vibrate and light up when you get near to a Pokémon in the real world. Tsunekazu Ishihara, the CEO of The Pokémon Company, said in a press conference today that he&#39;d been working on Pokémon Go with late Nintendo CEO Satoru Iwata for around two years.<br><br>Pokémon Go will be available in 2016 for iOS and Android — 20 years after the original Pokémon games. The game will be free to play, with various in-app purchases available. A price for the Pokémon Go Plus watch hasn&#39;t been set.<br><br>The actual game itself wasn&#39;t shown off too much during today&#39;s press conference in Tokyo, but you can watch the over-the-top announcement trailer below to get an idea of what The Pokémon Company, Niantic, and Nintendo are going for.</i><br><br><a href="https://youtu.be/2sj2iQyBTQs"><a href="https://youtu.be/2sj2iQyBTQs">https://youtu.be/2sj2iQyBTQs</a></a><br><br>ALL ABOARD THE HYPE TRAIN, CHOO CHOO! <s>Though if Skarmory isn&#39;t available in this game, I&#39;ll be so disappointed</s></p>

            <p>...but a quick look at Niantic&#39;s pedigree reveals the ARG Ingress, which featured a program that turned your phone not into a window into another world, but a device that allowed you to interact with invisible energy fields and use them to capture, protect, and interact with points of interest.<br><br>That being said, having your phone turn into a Devon or Silph Scope would be a pretty handy in-canon explanation.</p>

            <p>Ingress were pretty much experts on ARG, I expect this to be extremely good.<br><br>Also, I fully expect the Pokemon you get to be dependent on location. For instance, you&#39;d need to be on a mountain to catch &#39;mon like the Charmander line or Skarmory, and you&#39;d need to be in a city to catch &#39;mon like Meowth.</p>

            <p>On the downside, that means all of my favorite Pokemon would have to be traded in, because Ohio isn&#39;t really notable in terms of significant terrain features like mountains and such (though it does have rivers and lots of tall grass for fishing and level grinding, respectively). It would be fun to have fossil Pokemon spawn in museums or even dig sites, though!<br><br>I&#39;m currently Level 6 in Ingress, Resistance faction; the main reason why I&#39;m not really progressing as fast as I want to is because I&#39;m busy with Real Life and such.

            <p>You should have your &#39;mons at least three levels better than hers (I think her underleveled — since Staryu can&#39;t evolve that early — Starmie is level... 22?); I had no problems with her with level 25 &#39;mons. Charmander as a starter, no grass-types. Having a Gyarados with Bite helped, since Starmie is part-Psychic and therefore weak to Dark-type attacks.</p>

            <p>That is the one thing I dislike about the game, and the main reason I won&#39;t become a huge fan. I am not much of a grinding fan. I am an RPG player who likes my leveling to develop dynamically. I do my thing, playing how I wish, and put points into what makes sense based off of what I have been doing. If I don&#39;t have the skills to do something, then I am not supposed to be there just yet, and need to explore elsewhere. This game asks me to do a whole lot of grinding. After destroying my 5000th Weedle, it gets old. An then, the game expects me to meticulously breed Pokemon to be the most capable killing machines around. And that is just boring. The battles themselves are cool, the environments are fun, but the number-crunching... Not a fan. And I can tell, this is going to become a game of numbers, fast.<br><br>That freaking Starmie. That water canon wrecks my party in a matter of minutes. My poor Charmeleon (named Marvin, if you must know) has to be drip-fed potions to not be killed in two or three hits. And all the rest of my pokemon are super under-level, since Marvin has been able to crush everything before his path up to now. Haven&#39;t had any reason to level them much. Ugh.</p>

            <p>The second highest I have is a level 20 Pidgeotto (Ditzy Doo), who replaced Gust with Whirlwind because I had no idea what it did.

Mankey can evolve and become pretty decent, so don&#39;t drop him. At least, not in favor of a Beedrill. <br><br>Thirdly, using a Flying type in caves where Rock types abound is just asking for trouble. Use the Oddish in caves. (*scoops up mini-Missingno*) He&#39;ll evolve at level 21, so hang in there with him. Keep Absorb in his moveset; that&#39;ll be your biggest attack against Misty.<br><br>If you really want to not bother with training your Oddish, though, use your Pidgeotto against Misty. It can only deal neutral damage against your bird, whereas Water Pulse will wreck your poor Charmeleon. Just Quick Attack the Staryu and the Starmie to death. And don&#39;t worry about not having a decent Flying move on him; he&#39;ll learn Wing Attack at level 27, and in the meantime you can always use Whirlwind as a convenient escape route from wild battles. :P<br><br>And I suggest you keep the Paras on your team, as it learns Spore at level 25, which is a 100 accuracy move that puts the opponent&#39;s Pokémon to sleep. Definitely better than Sleep Powder&#39;s 75 accuracy.<br><br>If you want to talk about your other Pokémon, you know how to contact me via Hangouts. :)</p>

            <p>I can totally see that happening (Even with the differing time periods) but have there been any good crossovers between the two? I&#39;ve been playing the new Mad Max game, as well as a ton of Fallout, so it got me thinking about this. The two franchises have a lot to contribute to one another.<br><br>By the way, the new Mad Max game is awesome, if anyone is thinking about picking it up.</p>

            <p>A bit more serious though, it is not really possible lore wise. The ocean in Fallout is super duper inhospitable. While Tenpenny claims to be from England, the ferryman from Point Lookout reminds us that the seas are full of waterspouts and sea monsters that make deathclaws look like molerats. And Mad Max is in Australia. The only way a crossover might happen would be if somebody made a super souped up virtabird to fly across, and even then, the weather would make that unlikely.<br><br>However, Fallout is loaded with Mad Max references. While making Fallout 2 (might have been 1, but I think it was 2) they had Mad Max on loop in the background for inspiration.  It is to the point where I personally say the two are in the same universe, at least, on the Fallout side. As in, in Fallout, Max Max is going on concurrently. In Mad Max, nobody cares about America, so who knows.<br><br>The Shoddycast made a video about this, called <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-0lGHd-vus">Hidden History: Fallout = Mad Max</a> where they show a number of Max Max and references in Fallout.<br><br>Side note, why do you like the Mad Max game? I have been getting conflicting messages from critics and other players. As a huge Fallout fan, would I like this game? I&#39;m probably going to wait for TB to release his &quot;WTF is...?&quot; on it, but more input is never bad.</p>
