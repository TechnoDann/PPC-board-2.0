            <p>Welcome to another (super belated, whoops) round of Write the Genre! For the (pretty much everyone) who hadn’t been around for this before, WtG is a round robin game, focusing on agents Cris Wirewood and Myall Bromia, who reside in RC E#. There’s nothing suspicious about this, promise. However, they have something of a problem: The genre thingmabobby (properly called a  ‘genre and style regulator board’) for their response center’s console isn’t working properly so, it’s rather inclined to go haywire and change to random genres. Especially when agitated.<br><br>The previous mission can be found <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1o-HFM0bRdU-T0W1rdsvJbe4g7lK49f3nQgWB49CN3Hk/pub">here</a>, for those of you willing to read it, but the quick rules are thus:<br><br>1.You have to have Permission, or either have cowritten with someone who has Permission before. <br><br>2.After claiming the next turn, you have two hours to write it and then post. This is to prevent it from taking forever, and to give enough time to write a bit. If you don’t post in that time frame, someone else gets the opportunity to claim and write it.<br><br>3.You have to write said turn in accordance to the genre or even writing style given; the last one went everywhere from nature documentary to Dr. Seuss. <br><br>4.After finishing, don’t forget to include a genre for the next person to go with! Again, it can be pretty much anything! The sky’s the limit.<br><br><br>The mission(s) for this game is going to be <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8055828/1/Profesor-Lupus-and-the-Curse-of-the-Wearwolf"> Professor Lupus and the Curse of the Wearwolf</a> and its <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8736008/1/Profesor-Lupus-2-Fighting-Moudlermore">sequel</a>. <br><br><strong><br><br>“Cris. Cris-y.” Myall Bromia poked her dozing partner, who was currently slumped over their console. Saying her name while poking didn’t work. “Hey, hey.” A wicked look crossed her face and she grabbed the sword in scabbard at Cris’ side, before she said, in a reasonably on-point imitation: “<b>Hey!</b> Listen!” <br><br>Cris Wirewood straightened up in her chair, in a panic, trying to grab a sword that wasn’t there. “Navi, no!”<br><br>“You really have to stop falling asleep in here,” Myall said. “It’s just asking for trouble.”<br><br>“Like you?” She scowled. “And be careful with that, I know how clumsy you are.”<br><br>“Clumsy? <i>Moi</i>?” Myall gestured wildly. With the sword pommel in hand, like any reasonably not-so-sane agent. The scabbard flew off the sword, and hit the side of the console with a loud <b>THUNK</b>.<br><br></strong>_<br><br>The next genre is <i>Spy</i>.<br></p>

            <p>Myall and Cris followed McGonagall and Lupin to the common room for Ghosthand House (the <b>comoon rom</b> looked a bit like a giant CD made of silk), where they picked up Saruman and proceeded to the dungeons.<br><br>&quot;This needs to end soon,&quot; said Cris.  &quot;The minis don&#39;t step, and they&#39;re starting to get restless.&quot;<br><br>Behind the agents walked three mini-Balrogs.  sawsman accidentally stepped on Saurman&#39;s heel.<br><br>Saursman growled, &quot;Oh, wise guy?&quot; and stepped fully on sawsman&#39;s foot, leaving him hopping.<br><br>On the other side, Sarsman said, &quot;Leavum alone!&quot; and slapped the back of Saursman&#39;s head.<br><br>Saursman spun around and glared.  &quot;Whatsa big idea?&quot;  He poked the other demon in the eyes with two fingers.<br><br>sawsman laughed, &quot;Nyuck, nyuck, nyuck!&quot; and tried to hit Saursman on the head with the flat of his saw blade, but hit the slightly taller Sarsman instead.<br><br>&quot;Knucklehead!&quot;  Sarsman reared back his whip.<br><br>Myall rolled her eyes.  &quot;Ugh.  Enough!&quot;  She sent them back to OFUM.<br><br>The canons had gone to the dungeons to see if Voldemort had been hiding there, but had instead found a ghost that attacked them.  Considering how non-interactive Potterverse ghosts are, it probably shouldn&#39;t have been as much of an action scene as it was.<br><br>Eventually, Lupin expextro <b>did a expextro petrolium spell</b>, hitting the ghost in the face with a ghostly, glowing mini-Aragog, dripping with oil.<br><br>&quot;But it wasn&#39;t really a ghost!&quot; Cris announced.  It was really old man McTrollerson!&quot;  She unzipped the ghost outfit and let the troll out.<br><br>&quot;ohno net gain!&quot; it cried.<br><br>&quot;Here, let me clean that petroleum up!&quot;  Myall sprayed the troll with a blast of water from a giant seltzer bottle.<br><br>&quot;Some dinner with your drink?&quot; Cris asked before shoving a cream pie in the troll&#39;s face.<br><br>&quot;Wah&quot; cried the troll, who tried to stand up, but slipped on a banana peel.<br><br>&quot;We&#39;ll help you up!&quot; cried the agents.  They each took one hand and hauled the troll to its feet, zapping its hands with joy buzzers in the process.<br><br>&quot;Baawww&quot; whined the troll.  &quot;Dis somhew count as banisnmens!&quot;  It vanished.<br><br>((And tag back to July for the finale!))</p>

            <p>See, I mainly just know some HTML and whatever code the wiki uses, plus tiny things here and there that are good for other websites. I know enough to make things work and play around with things (broken URLs, various things in WordPress), stuff like that--but I&#39;ve never written a computer program, and have barely the idea of a clue of where to start. So it&#39;s less that this one scared me off as that I literally can&#39;t do it without first taking a course in computer programming or doing a *lot* of research.<br><br>So, uh, yeah. Some less specialized genres could be useful :) I&#39;ve definitely enjoyed reading what&#39;s been done so far, though.<br><br>~DF</p>

            <p>To describe how Cris and Myall felt as they forged on into the next chapter would be to describe one who is shaken beyond belief, terrified and terrorized by the trials and tribulations of both badfic and a changing genre. With the wind of the vaporized train at their backs and the replacements ahead of them, the agents found themselves in the strangest of place - one would describe it as a combination of a castle and a library, or perhaps a writing desk.<br>&quot;What is this place?&quot; asked Myall.<br>Cris checked the Words. &quot;Hogwrotes, I believe. I have a very bad feeling about this badfic, for there are as many mispellings in this passage alone as there are stars in the night sky.&quot;<br>At once, two more mini-Aragogs, namely Hogwrotes Sckoole, and McDongaol, and another mini-Balrog appeared, and as Bumbeldore declared that it was &quot;tim for a feast&quot;, yet another of the miniature spiders came crawling out of the darkness.<br>The agents sent the minis to their respective OFUs before they could notice, and just in time too. For the replacement, having spawned yet another mini-Aragog, declared that there were four new houses: Buffalochrage, a good house, Ghosthand hoyse, an evil house, and Parrotfaether house and Ratrunns house.<br>Not!Saruman stepped forward, and the Sorting Hat was lowered onto his head - &quot;Saroman you are to bein Gohsthand house!&quot; it declared.<br>&quot;but that is an evil house I don&#39;t want&quot;<br>&quot;hahahaha&quot; laufed sorter, as the agents shook their heads and exchanged shattered, broken glances.<br>&quot;The strange feeling, oh how it has returned,&quot; said Cris. &quot;We could be dealing with... with... a trollfic!&quot;<br>As yet two more mini-Acromantulas appeared, Not!Lupin and Not!McGonnagal were sorted into &quot;Buffalosharge house&quot;. The fic then spoke in a long sentence about the students going to bed, for want of a missing quote mark.<br>The chapter ended, with all the abruptness of a chapter being cut off. The agents just stood there, apalled, confused, and scared.<br><br>----------<br><br>Well, that was fun! The chapter to cover after this is Chapter 5. Next genre: Epic Poetry!</p>

            <p><b>Wish I hadn’t read that fic.  I keep making typos, now . . .</b><br><br>&gt; &gt; &gt; PLAY<br><br>“Hang on, Crissy!” The view of the camera’s video display suddenly went from darkness to colors, as the camera was swung up by the hand of whoever had recorded it.  “I want to get this on video.”<br><br>The person in the foreground—Crissy, apparently—slowly turned towards the camera with an irritated look.  “May I ask whatever for?”<br><br>“For posterity!  We’ll be able to look back when we’re older on the fond memories we forged—”<br><br>“In a trollfic?”<br><br>As the two humans bickered, the background slowly resolved into better focus.  Even then, it seemed incredibly unclear.  The location seemed to be made of some grey matter with random bricks stuck in the wall here and there.  There were torches high up on the walls, which gave off a dull red glow despite lacking any actual flame.  There were indistinct robed humanoids sitting at tables, watching the arguing humans, but—<br><br>The faces of a spider and fiery demon suddenly dominated the entire view screen, and the one watching flinched, nearly dropping the camera.<br><br>“Agh!  Don’t eat my camera!  Blasted minis!”  From the way the camera suddenly jerked, the holder seemed to have nudged the new creatures away.  “Just do it, Cris!”<br><br>“Fine.”  Cris turned her back to the camera and advanced on the seated people, waving a book over her head.  “We command this troll to leave this world!  The power of Rowling compels you!”<br><br>“Avaunt!” said the camera-person.  “No trolls in the dungeons today.  Or anywhere else on school grounds, for that matter!”<br><br>A dark, but strangely reflective, smoke began to settle over the room.  The camera began to turn rapidly back and forth.<br><br>“Ugh,” came Cris’s muffled voice.  “The troll essence was everywhere in this fic.”<br><br>“But where’s the troll?”  The camera suddenly stopped on a shadowy figure close by in the smoke.  “Uh.  Crissy?”<br><br>The figure lunged at the camera, and a big, green humanoid appeared briefly before the camera began shaking horribly.  The one holding the camera screamed.  Then, there was a crash, and color returned to the scene.  The camera’s image refocused as it accounted for the sudden sunlight.  The big green one rose above the camera and snarled.  Behind it, a gaping hole showed where the big thing had pushed the camera holder out through the wall of the now fully distinct building—a castle of some kind.<br><br>The troll raised its fists above it, but stopped when the camera-person said, “How does that feel?”<br><br>The troll gave a rather hilariously perplexed expression, then bellowed as said fists began smoking.  It tried to shield its head, but smoke began to appear all over its body.<br><br>“You are charged with trolling the <i>Harry Potter</i> universe and fandom, with giving Remus Lupin a nonsensical backstory, with kidnapping a villain out of <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>, with making enough typos to—Woops.  Guess that’s the end.”  The troll had completely dissolved into ash.<br><br>Cris appeared in the gaping hole.  “These guys are coming to, so let’s use Reparo on the wall and get going.  I already sent Saruman back home, though that might have been pointless if he’s in the sequel, too.”<br><br>The camera view jerked just slightly.  “Sequel?  This <i>thing</i> has a sequel?”<br><br>The human in view shrugged.  She pulled out a wooden stick and climbed out through the hole.  “Let’s just get it over with.  But first, Accio camcorder!”<br><br>The viewpoint suddenly and quickly flipped around, somehow being in Cris’s grip now, with the former holder, another human, laying on a buttress of the castle and covered in dust.  “Hey!” yelled the prone human, just before her face whizzed away, the camera showing a rotating view of castle walls alternating with the blue of the sky and the green of grass.  (And a final, distant audio recording of Cris saying, “That shouldn’t even work at Hogwarts, anyways.&quot;)  Then, the screen went black.<br><br>[<em>] STOP<br><br>The one viewing the video slowly let its arm drop to its side.  <i>What the hell did I just watch?</i> wondered Slender Man, still none the wiser as to why humans always seemed to be waving cameras around, and still short twenny dollas.  It dropped the camera under a tree and wandered away.<br><br>Had it stayed a little longer, it would have seen the video viewer suddenly start playing again.<br><br>&gt; &gt; &gt; PLAY<br><br>The camera lay on its side, grass on the left side, the edge of the castle at the bottom.  A breeze stirred the grass, and a bit of blackish ash was swirled up into the air . . . into the shape of a trollish face.<br><br>“Ill bee bach”<br><br>[</em>] STOP<br><br><b>The next writing prompt is: Manga/Anime style!<br>OR alternate super challenge prompt: math textbook style!</b><br>qwerty</p>

            <p>(Advance apologies to everyone who knows more about Japanese culture than I do.)<br><br>*Drums and flute sound, played by the A/V Division.  The usual kagami-ita backdrop shows only a generic grey wall, rather than a pine tree.  One figure in matching grey sits there, back hunched and facing the wall.   A second figure steps onto the stage, clad in a kimono mixed with Ancient Egyptian elements, and bearing a cat’s mask and a black fedora.*<br><br>“Greetings, travelers!  I am Bast, the Grey Lady, come to tell the tale (continue, really) of two samurai warriors poised to venture into the lands of the wizards’ school.”<br><br>*Chanting begins as two samurai in grey armor arrive on stage from either side.*<br><br>“These are the warriors, Cris and Myall!”<br><br>*Bast glances at Myall.*<br><br>“Who has been mysteriously genderbent, once again.”<br><br>*Myall is handed a more masculine-looking mask by a kuroko.  <s>S</s>he turns his face away from the audience to switch them.*<br><br>“I mean, seriously, girl.  Is it the name?  You can get a nickname.  Ahem!  These warriors of plot will now prepare for their journey.  Before they leave, they must seek protection for their mind!”<br><br>*Entering from the left side of the stage, one figure whose mask bears the facial hair of Doctor Freedenberg, another holding a fan painted with a riding crop—the symbol of Meir Brin.  They dance, waving their fans around the heads of the samurai, shaping barriers around them.  Before they leave, they each give one fan to one samurai.  They hold the fans before their faces, allowing the audience to read them for the first time.  Cris has received “COCOA” from Freedenberg; Myall has received “BLEEP” from Meir Brin.*<br><br>“They must gain protection for their bodies!”<br><br>*Entering from the right side of the stage, one figure with the helmet of Osbert, another figure dressed all in green, with a green mask, yeah, it’s the Jolly Greenman.  Deal with it.  They cross to the center of the stage, and enter into a mock battle with their fans.  Cris and Myall turn to watch raptly.  After the fighting dance is completed, they bow to each other, then to the samurai, awarding each a fan, which they display over their shoulders.  Cris has received “TRAIN” from Osbert; Myall has receieved “EQUIP” from the Greenman.*<br><br>“They must also gain the gift of stealth from the eyes of the unknown enemy!”<br><br>*The hunched figure stands and turns towards the audience.  This performer’s kimono is bedecked with fraying wires and loose buttons, and the mask is a reflective black glass.  It begins to move erratically, twisting about in a strange, formless dance.  The samurai approach cautiously.  As they get near, the Console leaps to the side, and pokes at Myall with a fan.  The samurai leap back, then try to approach the Console’s new position, only for the same  thing to happen to Cris.*<br><br>“Our warriors must gain disguises from the Console, but the machine is most fickle!”<br><br>*After many attempts to sneak up on the Console, the samurai begin to act more aggressively, brandishing the “TRAIN” and “EQUIP” fans at it, while the chanting lulls.  The Console relents, making pacifying gestures towards the samurai.  It then directs several kuroko to bring robes on stage and adorn the samurai with them.  The chanting begins again.  Myall gains the green and silver robes of Slytherin, and Cris gains the yellow and black robes of Hufflepuff.*<br><br>“Fully prepared, the samurai Cris and Myall are ready to venture into the lands of the wizard school.  The Console reveals the way!”<br><br>*Still twisting erratically as it moves, the Console steps to the kagani-ita and parts it down the middle.  Blue fog flows across the stage, and a great castle is visible through the mist.*<br><br>(I only capitalized the “c” in “console” because it’s a character in this context.  Don’t even start on me.<br><br>The next prompt is: tabletop role-playing game!  Have fun!)</p>

            <p>Welcome back to <i>Brain versus Fic</i>. Before the break, Cris was beginning to feel the pressure:<br><br>---<br><br><i>&quot;This is stupid.&quot; said Cris. <br><br>Cris was not nice. That was a Bad Thing.</i><br><br>---<br><br>While Myall was warming to her new body:<br><br>---<br><br><i>&quot;Well, hello,&quot; came a deep voice. It was attached to a very attractive smile.</i><br><br>---<br><br>But what happens when their progress on the Hogwarts Express gets halted?<br><br>---<br><br>[We cut to a green, slightly-faded night-vision camera. It&#39;s giving an extreme close-up of Cris&#39;s face, which ought to give everyone something to watch.]<br><br>&quot;Okay, so here&#39;s the thing. We were travelling on the Hogwarts Express - next carriage along with a glass pressed to the wall because <i>someone</i> can&#39;t cast a Supersensory Charm with a Muggle-Use Wand - but now we&#39;ve stopped. The not!McGonagall said something about an attack, but for all I know it might have been a conversation about the contents of her attic, God the SPaG in this place is atrocious. Wait. Hold up. Myall, do you hear that?&quot;<br><br>[Shakycam moving over to the door, where male!Myall is leaning out to look at something in the corridor. This should also give people something to look at.]<br><br>&quot;Myall? Myall, what&#39;s up?&quot;<br><br>[Myall turns around. Bumbeldore and Bumbelfore the mini-Aragogs are hanging from her sleeve.]<br><br>[MYALL, slightly pained] &quot;You, er, you wouldn&#39;t happen to have any bacon, would you? Or possibly a crowbar? No, that was someone else...&quot;<br><br>[Cris sighs and tugs the two minis off Myall&#39;s arm, portalling them efficiently to the HFA]<br><br>[MYALL, less pained] &quot;Thanks. I was trying to get a CAD reading on the Dumbledore replacement - must be getting a bit cramped in there, not that I&#39;d mind getting crammed next to Remus Lupin - but he&#39;s also sort of stuck in a tannoy system, which this thing doesn&#39;t have, and then he was outside fighting some weird OC called Mouldermort, who&#39;s Voldemort&#39;s father in defiance of both canon and sanity, and then I think spacetime went a bit... odd.&quot;<br><br>[CRIS] &quot;You&#39;re rambling a bit.&quot;<br><br>[MYALL, looking rather white.] &quot;Yeah, my CAD melted and, um, I don&#39;t think the fumes agree with me - oh, uh, uh-oh-&quot;<br><br>[We cut to a little while later, with a proper camera; Cris is trying to brush the sick off Myall&#39;s robes. A large fluffy boom mic is in shot, which the agents are doing their best to ignore.]<br><br>&quot;Are you feeling any better?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I think I ran out of lunch to make reappear, if that&#39;s what you mean.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Good.&quot; Cris rummaged in her bag. &quot;I&#39;ve still got my CAD, so we should be alright. Now, what did we pack for snacks? I&#39;m not going to trust the food in a fic like this, no matter whether or not it&#39;s Generic.&quot;<br><br>[A PACKAGE appears by plothole, courtesy of their console.]<br><br>&quot;What the...&quot; Myall poked the large box. &quot;Where in the name of sanity did that come from?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Australia, according to the tag on the outside. It says it&#39;s got lunch points for the Cafeteria in it - OH SWEET MONKEY CHRIST!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Shh! Shh! Don&#39;t alarm the Sues, the - oh. Oh, dear, turns out I had more lunch left in me after all. Welp, soon fix that!&quot;<br><br>[We cut to a close-up of the parcel&#39;s contents - a heapin&#39; helpin&#39; of witchetty grubs, bogong moths, and other sundry, wriggly, crawly delights]<br><br>---<br><br>Will the agents be able to earn enough lunch tokens from the Fictucker Trial? Will Agent Wirewood be made to drink her own urine for different reasons than normal this time? Find out after the break on <i>Brain versus Fic</i>.<br><br>---<br><br>Next genre: Video nasty!</p>

            <p>The video nasty... kinda sorta didn&#39;t exist. Think Grindhouse splatter movies crossed with Troma crossed with the mental outpourings of Dario Argento and the other great giallo directors. That was the aesthetic for a generation of horror films - but the video nasty term itself? Conjured into existence by a rightwing media engineering a moral panic to bolster circulation. Looking at you, Daily Heil. =]</p>

            <p>I knew it referred to videos that had been banned in England, but I was picturing less horror movies and more softcore pornography, which is why I didn&#39;t particularly want to Google it.  Unfortunately, I&#39;m not familiar with the genre, so I can&#39;t really take it.</p>

            <p>Since, well, I just only got back here, so I am back to square one and nowhere near to getting my Permission. Guess I will have to settle just watching this thing with glee. If it turns out anything like the first mission, this is will so cool and funny!</p>

            <p>Quick question: Does Discord know of the PPC&#39;s existence? Seeing as his powers over reality basically make him a Lovecraftian god, I highly doubt he could be neuralized.<br><br>And speaking of which, do the various Great Old Ones know about the PPC as well?

            <p>1/ We don&#39;t really need to think about things we&#39;re not actually writing missions into. ^_^<br><br>2/ Canon-cloaking.

Unless your omniscient explicitly <i>pays attention to</i> everything (rather than just having the ability to know about it), an SEP field should render agents unnoticed.<br><br>4/ Canon self-repairs after a badfic is dealt with. Lots of characters don&#39;t need neuralysing at all; they just have the events wiped from their personal history.

Any method of omniscience that isn&#39;t simply They Just Know By Magic is spoofable by the PPC.<br><br>6/ &#39;And then dark gods tore a dimensional rift into HQ and slaughtered everyone inside&#39; isn&#39;t funny. The PPC is a humour series. Rule of Funny should be consulted over and above precedent and logic.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Before you read this, this is more of a rant then a call for change. I have been of this opinion for a while, and I really wanted to let it out. You may see it as unreasonable. It probably is unreasonable, but it is just one of those things that bugs me about how the PPC works. Don&#39;t read too much into it. Just, take it is me letting off some steam on this issue.<br>--------------<br><br>Look at all the ways Agents should never ever be seen, except by Sues. That&#39;s just dull, to me. Why bother hiding? Sues? They are so self-absorbed, they probably will ignore you until it&#39;s time to do the Duty anyway. You, and many others have stated that the PPC is not supposed to be about super OP gods stepping in to take out uber baddies and be super badass, but a bunch of barely trained agents faced against near impossible odds with barely-working tech. And yet, all agents get to be completely invisible, with no need to be careful or cautious. After all, it&#39;s just not anybody&#39;s problem, right? Waltz right into Elrond&#39;s home: nobody will mind! Which is funnier to you: agents having to hold in their extreme will to scream out, carefully slinking through the shadows, and trying to avoid explaining why, exactly, they are in the Princess&#39; private quarters without permission; or just popping a portal right in with no whims in the world.<br><br>There is no tension with this stuff, and comedy needs tension as much as drama. Moreso, at times. Especially when the sneaking fails, and the agents have to try to cover their tails.<br><br>And I get it, kill the bafic, canon is back. Yay. But that just makes the job easy too. Now they don&#39;t have  to clean up any mess left behind: just let the kill happen and the job is done. Never mind the potential lingering impact of such a being, never mind what little artifacts the Sue or the agents left behind. It all just washes away immediately so we can all ship off and go home. That aspect seems to have been fading from more modern missions, and I for one welcome this change. It may only be a couple paragraphs more, but it does help show how overworked these people are. They just got done killing this Ultra Sue. Yay! Now they have to go through and pick up every last hair she may have dropped, so she may never grow back like so much sparkly fungus. For the good of the canon.<br><br>That all said, I do understand why we have the thing of the canon cloaking you. But even then, it can only go so far, Jay and Acacia even mention how they have to disguise themselves as creatures that would reasonably kill Sues, so that the canon cloak won&#39;t fall apart. It helps, but it only helps them blend in as characters. The SEP fields make it way too easy. Way too simple. Great comedy can come from great danger answered with great silliness. This removes all of the danger, leaving only silliness.<br><br>Bah, but who am I? Some guy who came in late who has only released two missions. I can&#39;t tell people to ignore an aspect of the PPC that has been used for years, especially such a staple as this. All I can do is avoid use in my own work where I can, and still have it be recognizably PPC.</p>

            <p>And the Outer Gods, since they&#39;re actually different things. The vast majority of Lovecraftian horrors are not omniscient; they are more like unstoppable forces than sentient beings. They don&#39;t really get involved with humanity except to destroy them. The two major exceptions that I can think of would be Yog-Sothoth and Nyarlathotep.<br><br>Yog-Sothoth very explicitly knows and sees everything. He would definitely know about the PPC. That being said, he&#39;s not in a position to do anything about it due to being sealed outside of reality (although that didn&#39;t seem to stop him in &quot;The Dunwich Horror.&quot;)<br><br>Nyarlathotep, on the other hand, is not omniscient. He is, however, much more involved with humans. More specifically, he likes to drive them insane. He is treacherous, cruel, and yet profoundly charismatic. Nyarlathotep acts as the emissary of the Outer Gods, of which I believe Yog-Sothoth is part of. So… he could possibly know of the PPC. That could be a very bad thing.<br><br>PC, amateur Lovecraft scholar</p>

            <p>What about Nyarlathotep from the Persona universe (which granted, is based on the one aforementioned)? We are talking about the Glaurunging embodiment of collective evil of humanity here. That means it is omnipresent and as result of that and also being the manifestation of something related to the human mind, it is also omniscient. And it is also Glaurunging bent on screwing over and destroying humanity, only keeping enough around to perpetuate it is existence,  for as long humanity and thus evil exists, it can never be destroyed.  <br><br>For that matter, what about YHWH (which is SEVERELY different God from the one from Judeo-Christian tradition) and Lucifer from Shin Megami Tensei? Again, we are talking embodiments of eternal concepts here, in this case Order and Chaos. <br><br>YHWH wants to bring everything in existence under his lawful rule, so I can&#39;t imagine he would be pleased about the PPC. <br><br>Lucifer by the very definition of his job is a wild card, and may either not really care or be opposed due to seeing the PPC as being representive of Order and imposing on the freedom he embodies. </p>

            <p>And, indeed, could be shorter. (Jack Harkness? Why?) Usually, these are reserved to those who are truly Omnipotent. YAHWEH, Aslan, Death, and so on. Due to having complete omnipotence in their job description, it is a little difficult to make them say, &quot;except this.&quot; So, instead, we make a plea to their better nature and hope they wont go blabbing about us. They seem to have kept their word thus far.<br><br>However, I would make an argument about certain other canon characters who are not on the list. Relax, they are not fourth wall breakers. You can see how I think they go below. Indeed, I don&#39;t even go with the argument of, &quot;But they are gods, so they must know, because they are deities!&quot; Unless total and complete omnipotence is in their list of powers, they can be neuralized. Is it harder? Possibly. But it can, and will, be done.<br><br>In my view, the &quot;Recorders of Fate&quot; or &quot;Keepers of Forbidden Knowledge,&quot; may very well have some old tomes relating to the Protectors of the Plot Continuum. The biggest one is, for me, Hermaeus Mora: Daedric Prince of Forbidden Knowledge. He resides in the plane of Oblivion known as Apocrypha. Here, in the vast, unending library, resides all knowledge of all reality. whether mortal man or immortal god was meant to know any of it, it matters not, only that it be recorded within this maddening realm. To those who wish to seek it, grand power and inspiration lies within. But, be weary traveler, for within resides monstrous beasts and tormented souls who have lost their sanity and selves in the ever eternal quest for knowledge. But, beyond the physical dangers within the Eternal Library, be most afraid of that which you seek. For glancing within the wrong book without the proper mental wards can shatter even the strongest willed of minds.<br><br>In my view, Herma Mora is effectively Omnipotent. It is his job to know all things. Even better, with C0DA*, my view is true! In my C0DA, Hormaius Mora knows every dirty secret of the PPC, and how it all works. He knows how to find the Pool. He knows the exact layout of HQ. He even knows how Legal works. He will simply never tell anyone. He is far too interested in seeking new knowledge (of which, there is never ending, yet, non-existent) and impressionable, desperate minds to break and bend under his control. So, if ever an agent should see a pitch black book in HQ, it is best to send it directly to the Library, without ever glancing within. For your safety, and every one else&#39;s.<br><br>As for any other recorders of forbidden knowledge, you can make the argument that they have it within their library, somewhere. But what librarian is expected to have their entire stock memorized? Again, anyone other then Herma Mora.<br><br>(No, I have not misspelled Hermaeus Mora once in this post. He has a number of spellings. The proper one? Such knowledge mortal man is not meant to know.)<br><br>(*C0DA is something... special for the Elder Scrolls canon. While it does not stand for anything, I like to say it unofficially stands for: <b>Canon Open; Do Anything!</b> It is complicated, but I will gladly go into it if anyone is interested. However, yes, it also stands to reason that in your C0DA, Herma Mora knows nothing of the PPC, and have it be just as valid as my insistence that he knows everything. All I can do is try to convince you to adapt my C0DA as your own.)</p>

            <p>Because Mora is not all-powerful.<br>I think that, to know about the PPC, a canon needs to be either omniscient (so neuralysing can&#39;t undo their knowledge) or omnipotent (so they can stop themselves from being neuralysed; this requires said canon to encounter the PPC at least once).<br>Anyone else... well, if neuralysing doesn&#39;t work, FicPsych should be able to figure something out.</p>

            <p>That shows up in Lily&#39;s Blackout interlude and I think in some other places, such as Tasmin and Emma&#39;s missions--think about it. He sees through perception filters, yet never really asks who the agents are? He knows. I don&#39;t think he does much of anything with the information, but he&#39;s OOC resistant into the bargain (only to a certain point, mind you. And he can definitely be replaced). He seems to have at least a very basic knowledge of what agents do--he certainly knows they&#39;re there to help, and I think he might have been recognizing Tasmin and Emma eventually?--and, well, yeah. He knows at least a bit.<br><br>~DF, who can track down some links later if necessary.

            <p>As in, most likely do not know of the PPC simply because they haven&#39;t heard of them.

Howver, she has had enough contact with time travel, and other weird things that she may assume that a multiversal, order-keeping, paramilitary organization exists. Guess what the PPC is? So, she may assume that something like the PPC exists, without actually knowing about it. Contact with someone like this could go as follows:<br><br>(Secret) agent man: &quot;Hey, did you know we&#39;re in the PPC?&quot;<br><br>Random Redshirt: &quot;No, what&#39;s that?&quot;<br><br>Agent man: &quot;We go around the multiverse protecting canons and killing sues!&quot;<br><br>Random Redshirt: &quot;Oh yeah, professor Cromwell said something like that might exist, here are our first contact protocols for this situation.&quot;<br><br>This logic is really prevalent in the study of physics.

            <p>When it comes to fourth-wall breakers like Pinkie Pie (or the Looney Tunes, Deadpool, etc.), I tend to hold to an interpretation paraphrased from &quot;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5mU0HfI2jQ">Who Framed Roger Rabbit</a>?&quot;<br><br><i>&quot;No, I couldn&#39;t have realized what you were at any time.

            <p>Usually, the canon cloaks agents from canon characters, but not Mary Sues or other OCs. Or, in my interpretation, fourth wall breakers. Pinkie and the rest can see agents at any time: they just have no context for why they are there. Why do you think agents go in disguise? For the Sues and these people.<br><br>The exception to this rule is as you said: only when it is funny. If Pinkie has a good joke she can make about the PPC to agents, she will make it, but only have the vaguest idea about what she is actually talking about, quickly dismissed. Call it a &#39;hunch,&#39; if you will. Just one of a million million possibilities she just plucked out of the air on a whim, that just turned out to be correct.<br><br>Discord on the other hand is... Complicated. To be safe, we will just say, no. He has no idea. And yet, he knows everything. It just matters so little to him, he never recalls it, even under direct questioning. But, ask enough, and he could diverge PPC secrets if he wanted to. Or not. Whatever particular mood he is in at the time. Lovely thing about chaos. You can never predict it.</p>

            <p>Because keep in mind, she&#39;s literally a goddess, and her knowledge is therefore infinite in the same way as Aslan&#39;s is.

            <p>Aslan is on a different tier from, say, the Norse or Greek gods, who are more fallible.  Similarly, I doubt any of the Pathfinder deities would be aware of what goes on in the PPC, at least in part because we don&#39;t really fall under any of their domains, and they have bigger issues to deal with.  They wouldn&#39;t show up for the same reason they don&#39;t show up when you&#39;re fighting a dragon or demon in the game.  <br><br>And honestly, I think it&#39;s real-world implications that are what gives Aslan his edge over other deities.  I&#39;ve seen Death and Madoka be given a lot of respect in this reality as well.  Without getting into a debate about religion, I think real-world influence plays a part in whether or not they&#39;re aware of what we do, and I don&#39;t think it&#39;s entirely unfair.</p>

I mean, if you represent the collective conscience of a race of Eldricht Abominations, which themselves individually contain the essence of countless ancient civilazations, don&#39;t you pretty much, in adittion to being the definition of a Tyme Abiss, attain something akin to omniscience? Which probably would count both for the Reapers individually and The Leviathans as well. But again, none of them would really care.</p>

            <p>Hi everyone! For those of you who don&#39;t know me, I&#39;m Dark Brother 16. For those of you who do know me, I have finally returned from the endless void (real life stuff) and I intend to stay this time. Of course, there will be intervals where I am off the Internet for a while, like we all are from time to time. I think I&#39;m going to renew my Claimed Badfics here soon, and I will attempt once again to gain Permission when I get a chance.<br><br>As an offering of renewed friendship, I am here to present something from the Pit, from whence I originally came. I have known about this Fic for a while, and have actually contributed to it a little bit.<br><br>Here&#39;s the link, and then a brief explanation.<br><br><a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7803566/1/Return-of-The-Brotherhood"><a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7803566/1/Return-of-The-Brotherhood">https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7803566/1/Return-of-The-Brotherhood</a></a><br><br>This story is a Suefic from The Elder Scrolls: Skyrim, and it follows Alyce as she attempts to rebuild the fractured Dark Brotherhood. The author of this Fic decided to accept submissions for characters for the whole story, with certain parameters and strings attached. As a result, many of these characters that are in here are Sues and Stus.<br><br>I will admit something. This story was one of the first that I followed and favorite while I was at the Pit. I was still in my early years of writing, and I genuinely liked this story. I even submitted a character named Nikita Contortus, my (biased) favorite character in the story. <br><br>Now, I am reluctant to submit this one, for the above reasons. However, the point of the PPC is not to insult or belittle the authors of stories, so I feel it will be okay. <br><br>However, I reserve the right to do this story myself. In fact, I am already making plans to make this story my Mission 1.<br><br>What are your thoughts? If by some chance I am breaking any rules (it&#39;s been a while since I was on here and I think I should read the Constitution again), please let me know.<br><br>~ Signed,<br>~ Dark Brother 16<br>~ Semper sint externa</p>

            <p>With the mission, I mean. You see, there is this C0DA thing in the Elder Scrolls. It gets rather complicated, but, to boil it down, there is no Canon, there is no fanon, all fanfictions are just as valid of interpretations of Mundus as the official Bethesda games. All of them. Let me explain further.<br><br>If you are familiar with the Elder Scrolls 3: Morrowind, then you are familiar with the work of one Michael Kirkblade. He is responsible for most of the Elder Scrolls&#39;... weirder aspects. There is a reason I say that Nirn is possibly more developed then the famous Arda. Kirkblade added several metaphysical aspects to his view of the land of Tamriel that shape its unique identity, such as CHIM, (basically the act of transcending and becoming a Buddah) and that all of known reality is a dream.<br><br>What does all that have to do with C0DA? Well, Kirkblade also introduced the concept of reincarnation. Not just of a person, but the whole world. Every time the world ends, for one reason or another, it will immediately be reborn, in a new form. Here, we have C0DA. Each person&#39;s individual idea as to how the world of the Elder Scrolls works is totally legit with C0DA. It is just one of many cycles, and cannot be dismissed. There are many reasons Kirkblade wanted to do this, partially because he likes open source fiction, partially because he does not like where Bethesda is going with the games and he wanted to stick it to them. <br><br>So what does this mean for the PPC? Well, in a way, it makes Elder Scrolls missions impossible. In a way, all fanfic is now canon. Or, well, at least, as Canon as Bethesda&#39;s version. Heck, even before this, the Elder Scrolls has been left purposefully open-ended. So much, they introduced Canon plot holes, in the form of Dragon Breaks. This was made in Daggerfall, so that all possible outcomes are Canon at the same time. All of them. It&#39;s called the Warp in the West. Major event in Tamriel&#39;s history. If you played Skyrim, you have a basic understanding of these Dragon Breaks.<br><br>However, if you are insistent, I can think of a few ways it could work. Your agents would have to work as Morag Tong, the assassins of Morrowind. They have legal contracts that allow them to kill in broad daylight. Well, in Morrowind, at least. In Skyrim, they would still be sneaky. However, it is a great excuse for a charge list. Just read the &quot;contract&quot; to the Sue when time to do the deed. Also, you would have to be very sparing in Canon charges. Unless it directly goes against everything that has ever been stated in every Elder Scrolls game, you may have to cut it a little slack. You are, however, allowed to point out how much this C0DA diverged from the commonly accepted one.<br><br>I am a bit of a lore nut. If you need help, I can see what I can do to see that your mission stays lore friendly.</p>

            <p>First off, missions don&#39;t necessarily have to be for canon-warping reasons. There&#39;s still the technical matters to think about.<br><br>Secondly, this C0DA thing sounds a bit iffy. What makes the work of Kirkblade — who from what I understand only worked on one <i>Elder Scrolls</i> game — more canonical than Bethesda&#39;s? What allows his strange and incomplete graphic novel override the work that all the other <i>Elder Scrolls</i> writers have done? Because people like his stuff? Because he&#39;s not affiliated with Bethesda (which I can understand people not liking)? That ultimately doesn&#39;t matter. The story — and thus canon — is dictated by those who write it.<br><br>The way you&#39;ve described it, C0DA just sounds like Kirkblade&#39;s own fanfiction. There is nothing to suggest that it carries any canonical weight. Much like the Fallout Bible, it is one possible interpretation of canonical events by an insider that can ultimately be overridden once the next game comes around.</p>

            <p>First is what I believe Kirkblade and WorldJumper are saying: that the fact that there are <i>many</i> quests with multiple endings, and therefore, each player has a different universe in Nirn - and every single one of those universes is canon. <br><br>However, there are fanfictions that go off the rails of <i>every single ending</i>, creating nonsensical variations that show up in no Elder Scrolls game ever, not could they. For example, in Skyrim, I&#39;m a big fan of Erandur pairings. There is no canonical evidence to support Erandur coupling off with anyone. Likewise, in Shivering Isles, what is the exact nature of the relationship (metaphysically, as well as interpersonally) between Sheogorath and Haskill? It&#39;s very much open to interpretation.<br><br>Good fanfiction <i>is still not canon</i>. A really great backstory about the sentient mudcrab in Morrowind is still not canon. A really great &quot;what happened after&quot; about the Companions in Whiterun <i>is still not canon</i>. I&#39;d love to write a story that ends the Civil War in Skyrim by putting the Forsworn in charge of everything, taking out the Stormcloaks and Thalmor alike. That&#39;s literally impossible as an actual ending to the Civil War - and so it <i>cannot be canon</i>. I&#39;d like to think it could be goodfic, but that doesn&#39;t make it canon.<br><br>Does that make sense? A fic that follows an OC along a quest perfectly in line with the canon ending may: A) disagree with the ending most players chose, making it non-canon for them; B) be a possible ending, making it canon for the game overall; C) still be a really bad fanfiction with a flat, boring character, bad spelling and syntax, and unrealistic dialogue.<br><br>Likewise, a fic that chooses a completely uncanonical quest ending might still have the characters at play be in-character and well-written, might adhere more to the spirit of the game, etc.</p>

A pretentious little twerp, yes, but he is near singlehandedly responsible for the more interesting aspects of Tamriel that separate it from your average fantasy setting. He is also responsible for one of the biggest Gary Stus in existence, (Vivec you prick) but I digress.<br><br>No, sadly, this is not just his own fanfic. Can Bethesda make it so? Of course they can (and I prey they do) but as it stands, it is more then that. He still works for the company (albeit as a freelancer rather then payroll) and he is a massive influence among the writers. While unconfirmed, it is said several writers who are still on payroll are in support of C0DA and it&#39;s ideas on canon. So, unless we want to draw the ire of the Elder Scrolls community, and directly ignore a potential massive aspect of how Bethesda treats canon, we have to careful in how we treat missions in the canon. Is it impossible? No. But it takes a lot more work then before.</p>

            <p>Michael <u>Kirkbride</u>, although he was part of the design team for Redguard and Morrowind, and wrote some pieces of lore for the game Oblivion; he does <i><u>NOT</u></i> work anymore for Bethesda, the weight of his word for canon has as much weight for TES canon, as Frank Miller&#39;s has for the DCU. In fact,  one of your links calls Bethesdaґs work &quot;canon&quot;. In all, as I see it, the concepts from C0DA are just fanon interpretation that has no weight on canon.</p>

            <p>I as typing most of this on my phone, which for one reason or another has Kirkblade in it. No idea why. So, that would be the reason for the misspellings.<br><br>Second, if you all want to ignore Kirkbride&#39;s musings over how things did not go the way he wanted it to, by all means, do so. However, I am not sure the rest of the world would agree with us. It is a very strong argument a writer could use against <i>any</i> mission we do in Elder Scrolls canon, and at the very least, we need to be ready for it. It is more then just fanon in almost everyone&#39;s eyes, and we need a good reason for why we are ignoring it. Or, we find a way to work around it.</p>

            <p>From what I&#39;ve seen from a cursory search, <i>Elder Scrolls</i> fandom is very divided on C0DA. There are people fanatically defending it and people dismissing it as another fanonical interpretation.<br><br>The PPC is dedicated to canon. And for <i>Elder Scrolls</i>, that&#39;s the information stated in the games. Personal opinion doesn&#39;t account for anything. Canon is not some new invention intended to further a company&#39;s bottom line; it is part of story-telling, and has been for a long time. Plus, considering that the majority of PPC missions are only shared amongst this community, I&#39;m not overly concerned about agreeing with &quot;the rest of the world.&quot;</p>

            <p>I have been spending quite a bit of time with the sort of people who hold the open source fiction ideal high, and muse over how everything has changed for the worse since Morrowind and all that other nonsense. I have overestimated how important those people are. I do still hold that it is something that should be thought about, however, I can accept that C0DA does not hold that much weight. Well, at least, for now.<br><br>Even without that though, Elder Scrolls canon is still very open to interpretation. It is a challenging world to work in. I wish anyone who attempts it the best of luck.<br><br>(One small side note. What is strictly canon is not just what is directly in the games. <a href="http://www.imperial-library.info/">The Imperial Library</a> houses all of what is considered canon, such as in game books and dialogue. It also has some things that never made it directly in the games, but are still referenced or otherwise confirmed canon. There are also two books now! Which I have somehow not read yet. Anyway, that is just minor nitpicking, but something I thought I should mention.)<br></p>

            <p>However, if I am, it is a very, very, <i>very</i> popular interpretation. Partially due to Kirkblade himself.<br><br><a href="http://c0da.es/t/c0da">Here</a> is C0DA itself. Read it if you wish. Just know that it is a script for a future graphic novel. And very, very confusing, even for a lore nut like me.<br><br><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/2reyef/what_is_c0da_an_answer/">Here </a> is the most accepted answer of what C0DA &quot;is&quot; by the TES lore community.<br><br>And now, a very choice quote from the author himself, speaking about canon on Reddit (which a massive part of C0DA was about):<br><br><i><b>What is your personal opinion on the idea of canon?</b><br><br>Tamriel never belonged to Bethesda. It was the other way around.<br><br>As for canon, it&#39;s really all interactive fiction, and that should mean something to everyone. That said, I appreciate and understand the stamp of &quot;official&quot;, but I think it will hurt more that it will help in the long run.<br><br>TES should be Open Source. It is for me.</i><br><br>So, there you have it. As far as we can understand, your C0DA is just as valid as the &#39;canon.&#39; There is a reason I am not fond of Kirkblade, but that is a rant for another day.</p>

            <p>There&#39;s this one guy who left Bethesda during the development of <i>Morrowind</i>, is still writing stuff for the community, and <i>he</i> thinks that every fan work is as valid an interpretation as Bethesda&#39;s work?

Doing 50% additional damage to enemies with any kind of status effect, major or minor, is good shtuff. Raichu, as a special sweeper, can take advantage of this - though be sure to use the ability Lightning Rod for the additional Special Attack boosts rather than going for Static. Raichu doesn&#39;t have the bulk for it. I&#39;d run Thunderbolt, Hidden Power Ice, Focus Blast, and either Teeter Dance if you&#39;re in singles - it&#39;s a really good way of spreading Confusion - or Thunder Wave if you aren&#39;t. Max out your Speed and Special Attack, with your last four EV Points in Special Defence, and select Timid as your nature, because high speed will really help you out and Raichu&#39;s base Speed is 110, which is pretty okay. However, you&#39;ll almost certainly need status spreader support if you want to get the most out of this item. =]</p>

            <p>So my computer decided to suddenly no longer work, and I&#39;m on a borrowed one for the time being, and in all that excitement plus a bunch of offline stuff the PPC ended up completely forgotten about (which is to say, I never quite got around to looking the Board back up). Hope people&#39;ve been doing well, and hopefully I&#39;ll have at least a few stories up and running soonish.<br><br>Now off to see what I&#39;ve missed, looks like some important stuff might have happened.</p>

Accuracy and Evasion modifiers are banned. Still, though, this makes Bastiodon slightly more swift, but it&#39;s really not what you should be going for on a Pokйmon like him. He wants tanky items - Repulsion Armour and Fire Shield from <i>Risk of Rain</i>, for instance. =]</p>

            <p>The story takes place in the Warriors series. None of the characters are canon, but the Clans are still there (forest territories, I think), as are the Clan traditions and customs and lingo and daily life and the belief in StarClan (and the Dark Forest, for those who know of it). I did my best to stick with canon for those, except for the main character who has a Suish name and a &quot;mysterious&quot; birthmark.</p>

            <p>... you&#39;re doing the mission on other grounds than canon-breaks, then? You&#39;ve ruled out Geographical Aberrations, (sort of), but there&#39;s still Technical Errors, Bad Slash (between two OCs is still bad), Angst, Bad Parody... oh, and I guess those guys in the Mary-Sue Department, since it&#39;s possible to act Suvian towards OCs as well.<br><br>The mission would basically run as normal: stalk the characters, make the charges, fix the problem.

            <p>How Sueish are they? How bit-character/generic are they? Can they be left to assimilate into canon, or are they too Sueish to manage it? That&#39;s the sort of question you want to be asking now. Bit characters and generics can probably just assimilate, maybe--they might become wild cats, though, since the clans are just about all named. Unless it&#39;s set earlier or later than the books, in which case let them assimilate if possible.<br><br>~DF</p>

            <p>Here&#39;s who&#39;s invited and what their characters promised to exchange for their egg, in case you need a reminder:<br><br>1. Iximaz - Alex Dives - TOS model tricorder<br>2. Alleb - Agent Alleb - one masterwork Naysmithe dagger<br>3. Phobos - Eamon Brightbeard - keeping Barid out of the way plus smithwork TBD<br>4. Scapegrace - Wobbles (but actually the Notary) - general clerking for one year<br>5. Darkotas - Bosh&#39;Guk - some healing potions? maybe a spellbook? (I forgot we hadn&#39;t actually gotten this settled. &gt;.&gt; )<br>6. Desdendelle - Agent Des - Avatar Aang&#39;s lightsaber (the guys decided they didn&#39;t need the sword)<br>7. PoorCynic - Teyala Solnerii - Pennacook Club interviews<br>8. Huinesoron - the Lichen - because it&#39;s the Lichen. (Dafydd, Constance &amp; family are also cordially invited to watch the hatching if they so choose. It seems only polite!)<br>9. JulyFlame - Building Maintenance reps - three favors, electrical work sans console, one job expedited<br>10. DawnFire - Dawn McKenna - TOS medical scanner, Retcon, one scarf<br>11. Edhelistar - Shui-Hua Liu - Mandalorian iron plus Water Tribe pendant (since she seems to want to get rid of it) and Iroh&#39;s jasmine tea (which Jenni is claiming as her fee for helping out)<br>12. ... <br><br>So, about number twelve. There&#39;s still a spot left! I&#39;m inclined to give the extra egg to Building Maintenance, since IC they&#39;ll probably get the most use out of a fire-lizard helper and it&#39;s always a good idea to keep the janitors on your good side. BUT! before that&#39;s set in stone, I wanna extend one last chance for another Boarder to put up a character for Impression. If you want in, please let me know what character you&#39;re using and what they&#39;re offering to Nume and Ilraen in trade, preferably in the form of an ICEP message, since that&#39;s what everyone else did. Please do this <b>within 24 hours of the time of this post</b>. After that, the offer expires and BM gets the egg.<br><br><a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=241484;article=5672;title=PPC%20Message%20Board">With that, here&#39;s the RP!</a> If you&#39;re already in, post away!

            <p>(Because it&#39;s only halfway to being a response.)<br><br>Nita Kerys prodded vaguely at her meal. The schedule at Building Maintenance had been a bit hectic recently, so her breaks were coming at essentially random times. Two hours after breakfast was far too early for lunch, even when those hours had been occupied pumping out floodwaters from Implausible Crossovers (something about an unbalanced pressure differential, apparently). But if she didn&#39;t eat, she knew she&#39;d be starving by the end of her shift.<br><br>A commotion across the Courtyard drew her attention. A bunch of small animals - no, those were Pokemon - seemed to be squabbling. As Nita watched, two of them fled into the grass - and then the third slammed its hands into the ground.<br><br>The tremour wasn&#39;t enough to throw Nita from her bench, but <i>did</i> roll her tomatoes off her plate. &quot;Oh, come <i>on</i>,&quot; she muttered. &quot;Those were the only thing I was looking forward to!&quot;<br><br>There was a blaze of light as the fourth Pokemon shot a bolt of electricity at the third, then leapt for its throat, teeth glittering with lightning. Nita winced as the Pokemon&#39;s opponent went down.<br><br>&quot;Sometimes,&quot; she murmured, &quot;I wonder if we had the right idea after all. Powers like that... how can we even know whether an agent&#39;s Suvian or not, if they can throw lightning around like confetti?&quot; She paused, chuckled. &quot;Or like coriandoli, as that Italian guy would be quick to point out.&quot;<br><br>One of the runaways had returned, and was now rooting frantically through an armoured vest of some kind. Nita&#39;s eyes narrowed. &quot;Wait... that dog-thing is from the <i>DIA</i>?&quot;<br><br>She watched as the returning Pokemon fed the dog-thing something from the vest - then as the dog leapt up and punched the lightning-one clear across the lawn.<br><br>&quot;That&#39;s not right,&quot; she said, half-rising from her seat. &quot;Internal Affairs aren&#39;t meant to... even <i>we</i> would never have beaten up an agent in public like that! That&#39;s...&quot; She stopped herself just before saying it, but the words hung in the air in front of her: <i>That&#39;s what the DIS did.</i><br><br>Nita watched the rest of the abortive fight: the arrival of the human DIA Agent, his care for the fallen electric Pokemon, the portal out. Then, very slowly, she bent down and picked up one of her tomatoes from the floor, dusted it off, and bit into it.<br><br>Her radio crackled. &quot;Hey, Nita,&quot; came the voice from another member of her team, &quot;did you decide to take the day off or something? We&#39;ve got krakens coming out of our ears down here; get a move on!&quot;<br><br>Nita snorted and tapped the button. &quot;We can sell &#39;em to the Cafeteria as calamari,&quot; she said. &quot;Give me a minute, I&#39;ll be right down.&quot;<br><br><hr>
<br><br>Um, yeah. Having written Internal Security to highlight exactly what Internal Affairs should never do, it&#39;s a bit alarming to see members of the DIA... doing exactly what they did.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>... that this is going to lead to another &#39;can I ask you guys to be more forthcoming with that sort of thing&#39; post, isn&#39;t it? So I&#39;ll &#39;spell out&#39; what I meant by my closing comment:<br><br>Beating people up is bad. Having DIA agents who beat people up is very bad. Saying that they will be punished/kicked out for it is good. Giving writers the impression that the DIA are prone to beating people up is bad. Giving <i>agents</i> the impression that the DIA are prone to beating people up is very bad.<br><br>The DIA originally existed for one reason: to bring in agents who had snapped and were a danger to themselves and their colleagues. When I wrote <i>Crashing Down</i>, that expanded to include, y&#39;know, fighting off invading armies and arresting people who were (apparently) threatening to attack HQ. As I recall, they didn&#39;t even have proper cells then.<br><br>They&#39;ve been creeping towards being the DIS Mark 2 ever since. Now we have a DIA who read people&#39;s emails, (some of) whose members think it&#39;s acceptable behaviour to publicly beat agents unconscious... yeah, no, I don&#39;t like that.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Let me assure you that Owen is meant to be a one-time thing. Scapegrace has pretty much hit the nail on the head when she points out that he has had a psychotic break. He is not representative of DIA whatsoever and I do not intend to write DIA in a manner that will bring about a second DIS. <br><br>I tried showing the break between DIA officer and this-guy-has-gone-off-the-deep-end when Owen shrugs off his DIA vest: he willingly abandons his responsibilities and his employers&#39; values in favour of his own plan of action.<br><br>I hope this clears up matters somewhat. </p>

            <p>How did we give readers the impression that the DIA is prone to beating people up? Owen was one agent who lost control, and it was stated pretty clearly in the interlude (as you noted) that this was a Bad Thing. As for other agents... um. Oops?  <br><br>And your mention of DIA reading people&#39;s emails... are you talking about the thread below? Because those mails were either sent to <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=281593;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">everyone in HQ</a>, or were <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=281693;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">forwarded</a> <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=281629;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">by</a> other agents.

            <p>You showed that that incident got stepped on, yes. But you also showed us Zeb not being particularly surprised about being publically confronted in a massively-aggressive way by the DIA. The impression I got was that that&#39;s how he kind of expects the DIA to act - even though they&#39;re not supposed to. I came out with the impression that the rules are generally winked at unless someone goes way too far.<br><br>I hadn&#39;t noticed that all the DIA instances were people forwarding them (see what we mean about people getting impressions that weren&#39;t what you were aiming for?); it actually doesn&#39;t make any difference, though, because - for instance - Agent Des forwarded an email because, what, someone may have hacked his emails? And he clearly expects the DIA to do something about that? That&#39;s a very intrusive, very we-will-control-everything picture of the DIA right there, and it&#39;s one that I don&#39;t particularly like.<br><br>(But, y&#39;know, I also don&#39;t particularly like the tendency for Bad Slash missions to be high-rated, the fact that people don&#39;t use appropriate disguises, and the way the Department of Floaters has ballooned up into one of the largest in the PPC. It&#39;s a good thing my preferences aren&#39;t The Law, n&#39;est pas?)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>As the guy who thought about forwarding the ICEP messages, my train of thought was roughly this:<br>1) Having your emails hacked, either maliciously or for the lulz, is Bad.<br>2) Such things should be reported to the police.<br>3) Who is PPC police — other words, who has jurisdiction in HQ?

            <p>Well, okay, it is one of the points, which is that you weren&#39;t saying the DIA was like any of those things. Which is good!<br><br>But... eh.

If Lacksidacksical wants to get her agent in trouble, she&#39;ll now vaguely remember &#39;hey, the DIA were reading someone&#39;s mail&#39;, and have her send an email which the DIA respond to. And if her agent then gets into an argument with a member of the DIA, she&#39;ll vaguely remember &#39;some DIA hardliners beat on agents who defy them&#39;... you can see where this is going.

So to answer the inevitable &#39;so what should I do?&#39;: ... don&#39;t have the DIA doing scary things to agents for a while! ^_~ Then it&#39;ll all drift into the same vat of memory soup as the previous - grief - thirteen years of the PPC.<br><br>ON THE OTHER HAND: hey, that was a good story. I really got a feel for Zeb&#39;s emotions. Owen I didn&#39;t empathise with at <i>all</i>, but... I don&#39;t think I was supposed to. And the description of the fight - while I sort of agree with Tira about the grittiness - was very active, very much propelling the action along without feeling, well, turn-based.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Is it really Iximaz&#39;s fault that Lacksi wasn&#39;t paying an appropriate amount of attention and misinterpreted things?  It seems to me that Lacksi&#39;s the one who needs a talking-to, not Iximaz.  I understand where the concern&#39;s coming from, but taking the attitude that people can&#39;t write certain perfectly valid stories because someone might misinterpret things in them.  If Lacksi makes poor writing decisions, that&#39;s on her.<br><br>For an alternative point of reference, I didn&#39;t see the fight as a DIA thing - I saw it as a <i>Pokemon</i> thing.  Jokes about cockfighting aside, it&#39;s canon that Pokemon enjoy battling and can be provoked to it by something as relatively harmless as a ten-year-old strolling past them.  Battling, even violently, is a perfectly natural part of their lives.  While the Pokemon agents may be more sapient than those found in canon, battling is still a natural part of their instincts.  Factor in that neither participant is overly stable at the moment, and you have the makings of a fight gone wrong.<br><br>I can&#39;t comment on the whole thing with Des.  I was under the impression that the whole hacking thing was a bit of a misfire in terms of people replying to each other in a roleplay?  </p>

            <p>Alleb chose to describe Michael getting Des&#39; message agent to Sergio Turbo as Mia hacking the system (and not, say, ICEP technical faults — that&#39;s the explanation Pippa&#39;s Ghost and Boarder!Sergio used for a similar occurrence) and I rolled with that.</p>

            <p>So based on that, I&#39;m not entirely sure where the idea that DIA is reading people&#39;s mail in the first place is coming from.  I thought Des was just going to report a potential hacker to them, which strikes me as pretty logical.  I suppose he could have sent the message to the Department Head, but honestly the Flowers have never shown much interest in inter-agent disagreements.  I wouldn&#39;t expect them to even bother to do anything about it.</p>

            <p>DIA operatives are as susceptible to your common-or-garden psychotic break as anyone else, if not more so considering their job. Lucario are borderline-Suvian at the best of times anyway (cf. their interactions with Smash and the fact that they look like a fourteen-year-old boy&#39;s fursona), so I buy this happening the way it did. I got the sense that Owen just <i>is not coping</i> with life in the DIA, or indeed in the PPC at all, and has taken refuge in this sort of hardcore win-or-die bloodlusting berserker persona rather than face the fact that his job is scary and difficult and causes him as much mental harm as physical.<br><br>tl;dr: Owen is bad at his job and it&#39;s finally come home to roost a bit.

            <p>Because Zeb is the only name in the interlude that I actually recognize.  I had a really hard time following the story, because I couldn&#39;t stop wondering who everyone was supposed to be.  It&#39;s one thing to introduce new characters, but I felt like the default assumption was that I knew who everyone was, and I don&#39;t.  Poking around the Wiki doesn&#39;t turn up any hits.  It also loses a lot of its impact, because I don&#39;t really know anything about anyone.  It felt like I tuned into an ongoing TV show without seeing any of the previous episodes, and given that I&#39;ve been following this series pretty closely, I shouldn&#39;t be having this reaction.<br><br>On another note, I&#39;m not super fond of the overly gritty tone used for the Pokemon battle.  I know Zeb is from a Nuzlocke, but it&#39;s <i>canon</i> that Pokemon get knocked unconscious all the time and usually can recover perfectly well.  I felt like it was trying too hard to make it darker and edgier, which wasn&#39;t really necessary.  Maybe it&#39;s just personal taste, but I&#39;m not really fond of the tendency to take lighter continua and darken them just to make them seem more &quot;mature.&quot;<br><br>Sorry for being so harsh, but I feel like this one is a lot weaker than the rest of the LMM interludes.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m going to have to agree with you when you say that Owen, Buck, and Tacitus&#39; official introductions came a bit out of the blue. All three of them appeared previously in RPs found on the Other Board but I think it&#39;s unfair to assume that everyone knows about them. Compounding the fact that the RPs were canon-optional, it makes for a rather confusing set of interactions. Perhaps I should&#39;ve introduced the three of them earlier in another interlude. That would&#39;ve made much more sense than having them suddenly be here.<br><br>And don&#39;t worry about &quot;harshness&quot;: I didn&#39;t feel that your post was being unfair to us.

            <p>It seems to me that a written Sue should be able to take on life, as it were, just as a canon character would (or, if we want to get meta, as the PPC agents do). But that it&#39;s strange and contradictory makes things interesting I suppose. You know I plan to write other &quot;big picture&quot; stuff (if there&#39;s room to now) so I reserve the right to go out and jot down my own ideas and such if I feel they fit, heh. It&#39;s an interesting bit of the setting to build on, especially since the same question can in a way be asked of any character from a continuum other than World One - I&#39;m sure by some people&#39;s standards Dafyyd is no more alive than a random Sue.</p>

            <p>How much alive is a canon character? Are they living persons or just a bunch of Words? Quite a challenging question to my Agents, especially since they&#39;re aware of being fictional characters themselves (being all three of them badfic recruits of some sort).</p>

            <p>A brief report from the central offices at Dreams Come True, Inc, headquarters of the loyal League of Mary-Sue Factories:<br><br><hr>
<br><br>&quot;Mistress! Mistress!&quot;<br><br>The Defective was showing more agitation than her breed was prone to, waving a sheet of paper at the monitoring camera. The Venomous Tentacula sighed.<br><br><i>This is going to be annoying, isn&#39;t it?</i> She tapped a spot on her desk, and the door hissed open. <i>Yes?</i><br><br>&quot;It&#39;s the PPC, mistress!&quot; the Defective yelled, rushing into the office.<br><br>The Tentacula stiffened. <i>Here? NOW? Activate the emergency pods! Contact General Dandy! If they&#39;ve come for vengeance, we-</i><br><br>&quot;Uh, no, mistress.&quot; The Defective paused to take a breath. &quot;They&#39;re not... <i>here</i>.&quot;<br><br><i>... don&#39;t scare me like that.</i> The Venomous Tentacula coiled her tendrils around the legs of her desk. <i>Then what?</i><br><br>&quot;They&#39;ve killed... oh, mistress...&quot;<br><br><i>Is it... what&#39;s the name of Wydenbrooke&#39;s replacement? That would be a nice break...</i><br><br>&quot;Um. No.&quot; The Defective held out the paper. &quot;Rose Potter, mistress. <i>They killed Rose Potter</i>!&quot;<br><br>The Tentacula&#39;s leaves rustled. <i>... I&#39;m sorry, who?</i><br><br>The Defective couldn&#39;t keep herself from blinking. &quot;Um, one of the greatest Mary-Sues of all time? The one you referred to as &#39;the pride of the League&#39;, and &#39;the most potent creation of these Factories&#39;?&quot;<br><br><i>Oh, THAT Rose Potter. So?</i><br><br>The Defective was floundering. &quot;So... so we need to get revenge! They can&#39;t just DO that!&quot;<br><br><i>Hmm.</i> The Venomous Tentacula tapped at her desk again for a moment. <i>Why not, precisely?</i><br><br>&quot;Because... because... because they can&#39;t!&quot;<br><br><i>I see.</i> Behind the Defective, the door swung open again, and two of her pale &#39;sisters&#39; stepped in. <i>Seize her,</i> the Tentacula ordered.<br><br>&quot;What? Mistress!&quot; The Defective struggled against her captors, but they were just as strong as her. &quot;I don&#39;t understand...&quot;<br><br><i>We have produced thousands of Mary-Sues from this factory alone,</i> the Tentacula explained. <i>The loss of one, however famous it may be, does not matter one lateral. It is as insignificant as... well, as any given Defective.</i> She returned her attention to the other two, ignoring her former secretary&#39;s cries. <i>Take her away, recycle her, and appoint me a new secretary. I want to see the front desk womanned again within the hour. Understood?</i><br><br>&quot;Understood,&quot; the pair said in perfect unison, and dragged their over-emotional sibling out of the office.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I don&#39;t think the PPC would benefit from having a &quot;villain&quot; or &quot;foil&quot; working against it, especially not an organization of Sues. <br><br>Here&#39;s my view on this: Mary Sues are like a disease within a canon. Most of the time, they&#39;re not actively trying to destroy a canon; however, the way they are written naturally causes them to degrade the world around them, to bend the world around their existence. A badfic is like an infection within canon, and the PPC acts as an antibody. <br><br>Goodfic coexists with established canon, bad writing clashes and damages it. It&#39;s a naturally-occurring thing brought about through the worlds created by writing, not attacks on canon orchestrated by some shadowy force of corruption. In this case, think bacteria. There&#39;s a lot of different kinds within your body; some of it coexists with your immune system to strengthen it, while other kinds are harmful and cause you to get sick. It&#39;s not actively malicious, but you still get sick just because it&#39;s there. Mary Sues are like bad bacteria.<br><br>The PPC is basically a team of Almighty Janitors cleaning up a mess made by botched uses of a setting, not some army fighting against forces of evil. Having this League just wouldn&#39;t fit.</p>

            <p>Obviously my post that this was just one mission was a case of misplaced optimism.  As people said in the earlier thread, we don&#39;t want to go into a whole bunch of big Emergencies and darker plots.  Let&#39;s leave Rose Potter and Little Miss Mary where they are, instead of trying to imitate them.  Not only is it taking the PPC in a direction it&#39;s not really meant to go, it feels a bit like you&#39;re trying to use Iximaz and co&#39;s success to get more attention for your own thing.</p>

            <p>Now, I obviously didn&#39;t actually get around to even attempting to get Permission before I had to vanish (though I was considering it the time before the circunstances that caused me to do it happened) and I don&#39;t think it would it be very wise to try it right now while few people know me around here, so at this juncture this is merely a theoretical question. <br><br>But in the case of something like <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5813363/1/Adopted">Adopted</a>, which is the badfic I plan to use for my future attempt, could one use blatant disregard for World One laws as charges? <br><br>To clarify, this is a fic where one of the main concerns (along with more obvious Canon Violations, like the pairings of Harry/Hermione, Ron/Luna and Draco/Ginny, not mention the Temporal Paradox created by making Hermione younger than Harry ) is the highly illogical adoption created by the Sparkly Child Sue responsible for this Glaurunging mess.  <br><br>Harry and Hermione are both eighteen in this story, which would make this Glaurunging whole plot impossible since by British law at the time you would have to be at least twenty-one to adopt, and even then you would to have be either single, married and/or adopting the child of your spouse , and the aforementioned pair is in none of those categories. Instead, they are just two best friends who decided on the spur-of-the-moment (which is so OOC for Hermione that I can&#39;t even begin to tell you) to adopt a child together. <br><br>And that is the just the first in an endless litany of legal errors. Now, the reason I bring this up is that, to my knowledge, unless Rowling states otherwises, the Muggle world in Harry Potter should be almost exactly the same as World One, which should make things the Children Act 1989 practically canonical. <br><br>If I&#39;m wrong with this theory, one could probably just charge based on the impossibility and Illogic of the whole thing, so it would be no great loss. </p>

            <p>I mean, yeah getting the setting (in this case Muggle Britain) is certainly part of the problem. I think if one is going to write a story about something related to the real world, in this case an adoption process in the UK, then they should do the appropriate research. Which is why I&#39;m also going to charge for &#39; Failure to do the research&#39;.</p>

            <p>Stuff like that could easily be charged for under things like &#39;failure to do the research&#39; and &#39;sending people OOC&#39;. <br><br>As for actually charging them breaking laws, well, agents don&#39;t have any real authority to do so, but that doesn&#39;t have to stop them.

            <p>Well, i did say it would probably be no great loss if it couldn&#39;t be done like I thought. &#39;Failure to do the research&#39; and &#39;making characters OC&#39; sound about right. I mean, would someone like Hermione, who is clever, knowledgeable and resourseful and prefers to only break rules when absolutely necessary, really just jump in head-first into something as life-changing as an adoption without apparently doing any research at all? Really!?  <br><br>Nice to know that there is a precedent for that sort of thing. Mind if I ask what mission that is? <br><br>Thing is, like I previously said, these problems are one of my main concerns with the badfic. So I would probably  have to find a way to make major charges about it. The above charges plus some about the impossible and Illogical plot would mostly cover it, but I still feel something would be lacking in that regard. I would still have the charges for more obvious and Canon Breaking bad writing, such as everything related to Sue herself, non canonical pairings, the aforementioned Temporal Offense and the other bad OCs in the story to make for it though.<br><br>Then we have instances where the bad writing manages to Break Canon AND cause issues related to said laws at the same time. In one particularly Glaurunging bad case, Harry and Hermione have apparently had their educational records forged to show that they attended a &quot; School for the Gifted&quot;. That may not actually break the Statute of Secrecy, but it seems pretty damn close to me, as well being incredibly stupid. I mean, what the Glaurung did they do about grades and certificates? They can&#39;t exactly list the results for O.W.L.s, you know.</p>

            <p>Yup, that&#39;s one of the great things about the PPC setting: if you look long and hard enough through the archives, you can probably find precedent for anything (of course, that could also be a bad thing, and the more you look the more likely you are to find contradictions too). <br><br>The mission I was referring to is <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1e5foSyJMlUOacJ3RPpSVFxlXGfXDgYn45omukE9YyoI/pub">here</a>, although I bet there are other examples too. <br><br>As for the faked certificates, um... maybe they had access to some <i>Doctor Who</i> psychic paper?<br><br>- Irish </p>

            <p>I don&#39;t actually know that continuum at all, but it seems like a nice mission. That part about pseudo-charging for the crimes is really interesting. <br><br>But now that I have thought more about it, something like that wouldn&#39;t work in this case. Since the Sue in question is the child being adopted herself, she is not the one who is violating the relevant laws. Maybe I could charge for &#39; altering reality and manipulating canons and OCs alike to blatantly ignore even the existence of the relevant laws&#39;?<br><br>That sounds like a major enough charge to me. After all, it is really bad writing. By disregarding such matters, the Suethor can both make things too easy on the legal process side, losing some good oppurtunity for actual well-written drama, AND also use it to heavy handingly apply the Rule of Drama. Just see how easily the Sue got adopted by Harry and Hermione (seriously, adopting a child from the Nursery is probably harder than adopting a child in this fic) and later on, how also easily she was taken away by her Obviously Evil Birth Mother. Who then beats up and treats her as a slave, of course. <br><br>You know you got it real bad with a badfic when something like that explanation could actually make more sense than what actually happens in it. </p>

            <p>As for the Sue not being the one to actually break the laws in this case, well, we have a tendency to blame the Sue for any bad writing that happens in their presence, so if you wanted to transfer that to laws/crimes you could always go with &#39;conspiracy to commit...&#39; type charges.

            <p>That was mostly what I was going for with charge I suggested in my last post. But according to that, since Harry and Hermione wouldn&#39;t be actually legally allowed to have the Sue in their custody, I guess could I probably charge for &#39;conspiracy to commit kidnapping&#39;. And for the all the laws and procedures broke by the CPS OCs. I swear, every since adult in this thing, canons and OCs, seen to be affect by her. The only salvageable characters seem to be the two child bit ones in first  chapter (though one of them does fall in the category of unreasonably hating the Sue) and maybe the baby Harry and Hermione have in the last chapter. <br><br>I will probably get to actually use pseudo-charges for broken laws with Sue&#39;s Birth Mother though, for also effectively kidnapping a child and then neglecting and abusing her. <br><br>And I will probably have to charge for having Speshul Powers, since this fic somehow make Hermione of all Glaurunging people to think that to the Sue is magical without a shred of evidence to support that conclusion (She REALLY has being with the Moron Beam in this Suefic), followed by Harry saying, and I quote &quot; ... I mean, it probably explains why she her parents didn&#39;t want her. She may have had a rare accidental magic the day she was born ... She&#39;s probably a Muggleborn, like you are, and her parents didn&#39;t know what to do with her.&quot; SERIOUSLY!? Isn&#39;t it Canon that you have your first bit of accidental magic when you are what, six years old or so? <br><br>Then there is her terrible past: &quot; It all started with Georgiana. She was the first one here. She&#39;s been here since she was born. Her birth parents left her here the day she was born. Didn&#39;t want her. Didn&#39;t care for her...&quot; <br><br>&quot; We had countless parents ... come here. And not even one of them has considered Georgiana. They always pass her up and went for the next child.

            <p>So, as some of you might know, I play <i>Dungeons and Dragons</i>, and until a few weeks ago, my gaming group met regularly for over six years. I finally decided to start chronicling our adventures in narrative format, the first bit of which can be seen <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1enRBeDaChk4JWnGP2DduaZwJsxieDKJbQfdAoJT33Pc/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>.<br><br>I don&#39;t know if this&#39;ll ever be completed, but it would be pretty cool if it was. ^^; Enjoy!</p>

            <p>I think it&#39;s a combination of the large head relative to the body (especially the limbs) and the fact that the way the left arm crosses the hip looks like... you know that pose where one arm goes straight down, and the other one wraps across your chest to hold the elbow? It looks like that.<br><br>(I like the strong &#39;diagonal&#39; feel to the picture: the robe-thing goes one way, the shoulder-hump makes a line with the hip-flare, the face is angled on both sides, the shield has a diagonal with the yellow symbols.

            <p>Would anyone be up for a body switch event set in HQ? I originally wanted to do one way back in 2008, but the Macrovirus crisis ended up taking the timeslot. Basically, if enough are up for it, (since this would be an all-hands event) I&#39;d set up a spreadsheet for everyone volunteering for it to toss their characters in to offer for their body being swapped into by another character, and set up the RP on the other board. The RP would include a plot, besides the introductory freakout, with the following:<br><br>i. Couple agents bringing in a body-switching device from a badfic and then it going off in HQ and subsequently getting lost in the midst of the following chaos- if anyone would like to volunteer their agents for that, it&#39;s fair game, otherwise I&#39;ve got a pair I&#39;d be introducing through this.  Cue it going haywire and affecting a good deal (if not all) of HQ. Characters can of course be exempt for whatever reason you can think of if you don&#39;t want them involved with actually getting bodyswitched! (They were on a mission, their particular brand of paranoia means they decided an aluminium hat was a wonderful accessory and it actually worked, they were somehow not in range, bizarrely naturally resistant, and so on.)<br><br>ia. As previously mentioned: Chaos. Well, more than usual. <br><br>ii. Hunting down the device! Because most people would probably prefer to be back in their usual body, and don&#39;t want to think about this whole thing too hard because it&#39;s too weird even for the PPC. This can be split into smaller groups, and I&#39;ll even roll a die or flip a coin depending on how many people want to get involved in this as far as whomever finds it goes. <br><br>iii. DoSAT doing their thing and fixing the problem and restoring everything back to normal (for the PPC). Cue relief, for the most part.<br><br>Overall it&#39;d take place over HQ time of about five days, starting either Sunday or Monday if people are interested. Since this is an RP, as usual by board standards, <i>everyone</i> can take part even if they don&#39;t have permission (just keep in mind that an eye&#39;ll be kept out on you if you go overly wonky or too out of line!). Of course there&#39;ll be guidelines, like &#39;this is not an excuse to maim someone else&#39;s character&#39;s body without permission&#39;. <br><br>Feel free to ask questions if you&#39;ve got any.</p>

            <p>Can  I add an extra character? The character is Technician Shui-Hua Liu. She doesn&#39;t have a page yet, but here&#39;s the information that may be needed: She&#39;s a mixed race Waterbender, born in Republic City, and as such she has blue eyes. She has a rather pale skin and her back-long hair used to be black, but she dyed it blonde, and keeps it in a tight braid. She&#39;s nearsighted and needs glasses. And she&#39;s in charge of the maintenance and operation of the Danger Room.<br><br>Abnd now, the extra details. Whoever gets into Solvig&#39;s body, won&#39;t get to use her powers, thanks to the Output Limiter; <u>unless</u> that person manages to convice Yuuna, or anyone else with the authority to deactivate it, or gets body swapped with Solvig while she is in the Danger Room, in which case, that person will be rather forced to interact with whoever gets into Shui-Hua&#39;s body, and quite likely will damage the Danger Room.<br><br>My other characters are left out of this, I have other plans for them.</p>

            <p>Yes,  you can add extra characters. As many as you like (within reason). <br><br>As for Solvig, that is something to discuss with whoever writes whoever gets her body!

            <p>You volunteer your agents on the spreadsheet if you want them involved with the body swap but don&#39;t have a super specific preference. Once there&#39;s enough, I&#39;ll be applying randomized results.<br><br>That&#39;s pretty much what I meant. It&#39;s an opt-in by default, since I don&#39;t like people feeling like they have to be forced in. It&#39;s basically a &quot;if they&#39;re in HQ you are more than welcome to have them affected if you want&quot; sort of deal. I specified HQ as more being the limit of where it would happen, rather than it being able to happen to agents in the field at the time. <br><br>If people have DoSAT agents they want to volunteer for that part- and several people do!- we can go that route. There is also always Makes-Things.</p>

            <p>For those who don&#39;t know (I&#39;m guessing that&#39;s a very small number, &#39;cause I like talking about this) I&#39;m writing Disney&#39;s Official Fanfiction Academy. It deals exclusively with the Princess films, and it&#39;s coming along nicely! However, I could use some suggestions. <br><br>Y&#39;see, I have 31 different canons that have fan followings, but I only have a handful of fanbase names, i.e. &quot;Gaston Glompers&quot; and &quot;Philip Phanatics.&quot; I&#39;d really like some help from you guys with this. <br><br>Here is a list of the canons:<br><br>Princes--<br><br>Prince Florian:<br>Prince Charming:<br>Prince Phillip: Phillip Phanatics<br>Prince Eric:<br>Beast/Prince Adam: Wee Beasties <br>Aladdin:<br>John Rolfe:<br>Prince Naveen:<br>Flynn Rider:<br>Kristoff:<br><br>Princesses--<br><br>Snow White: Snowflakes <br>Cinderella: Cinders<br>Aurora: Borealists<br>Ariel: <br>Belle: <br>Jasmine:<br>Pocahontas: <br>Mulan:<br>Tiana:<br>Merida:<br>Rapunzel:<br>Elsa:<br>Anna:<br><br>Villains-- <br><br>Queen Grimhilde: Evil Princesses/Evil Princes<br>Maleficent: Minnificents/ Maleficentians <br>Lady Tremaine: Ladies-in-Waiting<br>Ursula: Sea Urchins<br>Gaston: Gaston Glompers<br>Jafar: Jafarians<br>Ratcliffe: Absolutely no one<br>Shan Yu: Hunnie<br>Dr. Facilier: Facilitators, of course.<br>Mother Gothel: Daughters of Gothel<br>Hans: Princesses of the Southern Isles<br><br>All names that I have on here are subject to change and critique.

            <p>I probably ought to explain this thread a little bit, so here it goes.<br><br>I was working on my agents last night, and decided I didn&#39;t like them as much as I thought I did, because they didn&#39;t lend themselves to comedic purposes very easily. And since comedy and fun are kind of the point, I decided to go a whole new direction with my agents.<br><br>I decided I would create a sort of &quot;losers&#39; squad&quot; with my agents, meaning that in one way or another, they always mess up on their missions (even though they nearly always manage to kill their targets). <br><br>Once I started trying it from that angle, all kinds of comedic material opened up for me. My &quot;practice missions,&quot; or my &quot;test runs&quot; with my Claimed Badfics, turned out great and I could easily tell different stories with multiple permutations (I sounding smart!). <br><br>But I want to do some research. I&#39;m unsure if I can phrase this question in a way that doesn&#39;t offend anyone, but I will try anyway. <br><br>&quot;Can anyone point me in the direction of agents who are challenged by irregular problems, even for PPC agents?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Are there any agents who had to deal with significantly more than everyone else on a regular basis?&quot;<br><br>Or something like that. If I&#39;m being unclear, please let me know, and I&#39;ll try to explain better. If I offended anyone, I apologize in advance, but the question I had to ask didn&#39;t give me much to work with.<br><br>Semper erit insanus</p>

            <p>I&#39;m getting a gut feeling you&#39;re focusing on the wrong things in your writing. Yes, missions are inherently comedic, at least most of the time... but from what you just described, it feels like you&#39;re trying to force that humor with a gimmick. Don&#39;t focus on having your agents be &quot;funny&quot;, focus on them being well-rounded and suited to a story. Think of them like actual people, not a medium of hilarity. Make a a good character, and let the badfic bring the humor.</p>

            <p>As a general rule, most characters have something they&#39;re good at and something they struggle with.  While too much of the former is the most obvious cause of Sueishness, too much of the latter can also be bad for a character.  If your characters manage to succeed at difficult tasks despite lacking any sort of skill or aptitude, it make readers wonder why exactly they somehow manage it.  You could end up running into deus ex machina territory, or even Anti-Sues.<br><br>I&#39;d suggest just poking around the wiki and trying to find an agent that&#39;s a good example of what you&#39;re looking for.</p>

            <p>Everyone. Sort of. A bit.<br><br>See, it&#39;s no fun at all to have agents who are super duper good at their jobs - that way Suvianism lies. Instead, think about the <i>people</i> they are, think about <i>who</i> they are, and how <i>that</i> would help or hinder them in the field.<br><br>I kind of took this approach when designing my first Agent, Wobbles the Clown. She&#39;s a clown. Clowns are large and loud and brightly coloured, at least kids&#39; clowns are anyway. This is distinctly suboptimal for covert operations. But wait - we have disguise generators for that sort of thing! Hm. Make them not work. How? Say, didn&#39;t Harry Dresden have this thing where he made tech go boom by moving close to it? How would this inform someone&#39;s character? Would that be a disability? How would she work, what would she be doing, why is she here at all...<br><br>And so on from there.<br><br>Of course, her partner&#39;s more renowned around these parts anyway, but her disability is that she&#39;s an incorrigible git. So there&#39;s that. =]</p>

            <p>So I was digging through chatlogs from last year and found some number crunching I&#39;d done for fun and meant to post but never got around to doing so, so here it is.<br><br>The common refrain is that agents are horrendously overworked. To be sure, this is an incredibly demanding job, and in the middle of a badfic explosion it must feel like the missions have no end to them, but is it really as bad as some stories have made it out to be? For sure, we see a lot of stories about agents on their off time nowadays, which implies things have slowed down a good bit from the days Jay and Acacia were swinging swords at all things glittery, but I was curious and decided to test things out with a basic model I drew up. This is by no means totally comprehensive, there&#39;s too much missing data and too many variables for that, but there is enough here that the results are pretty interesting, I think.<br><br>Bob and Alice are two agents in a Generic Action Department, we could assume they&#39;re in DMS LOTR Division or Department of Floaters I suppose because of the specific category I&#39;m drawing on for example numbers. Let&#39;s assume Bob and Alice get three missions a day, every day, in one year of working for the PPC; I consider three missions daily to be a minimum marker for &quot;overworked&quot;/a generally stressful workload, mostly because I personally don&#39;t consider much less than this to be all that great a workload - I&#39;m sure some would disagree, it could be argued that even one a day is a very high workload considering the incredibly demanding and time consuming nature of a PPC mission. I will be including alternate calculations for one-mission-a-day. Three missions also seems to me to be as many as an agent pair would be able to take on in a day while still allowing them to meet sapient needs for food, rest, social time, and the like - that would be, say, one mission in the morning, one in the afternoon, and one in the evening, or all in one block at one time of the day, depending on when they arrive. <br><br>So we have our agents, and our rough workload. Bob and Alice kill three fics a day, every day, for a year, tallying 1095 missions performed by the end of the year; the Lord of the Rings section on fanfiction.net has 54,000 fics in it, most of which were probably written in the great fanfic boom of 2001-2004. At this workload, it would take Bob and Alice 49.32 or so years to kill every fic in LOTR, and even longer if you merge the Hobbit (11K) and Silmarillion (4.7K) sections with LOTR under a general &quot;Tolkienverse&quot; banner, at which point you&#39;re looking at 69.7K fics ahead of our heroes.<br><br>However, Bob and Alice would not be the only agent team in their department. This is where the second part of my model comes in: the fourth largest Action Department, DAVD, has at least 50 agents. Ignoring questions of why so many other Action Departments have fewer than 50, this seems like a good benchmark because not only is it a large number of agent teams all working at once, but the three most prominent Action Departments - Floaters, DMS, and Bad Slash - are implicitly or explicitly much larger. It&#39;s implied in several places that many thousands of agents work for the PPC after all, and depending on how literally you take a speech made by the SO in Reorg (&quot;If any Guards are listening, I urge you to heed my words. You may think yourselves a match for any Assassins, and that may be true, but the DMS outnumbers you ten, a hundred to one.&quot;) the DMS might have had up to 40,000 agents in 1999 (the DIS, when they became the Black Cats, had about 350-400 members, this including outside recruits, and the formation of the Black Cats is after they retreated from HQ having taken, in Nendil&#39;s words, unsustainable casualties in the fighting against the PPC; this means their effective strength immediately before the civil war must have been above 350 Guards, and 350 * 100 = 35,000), though this would be modified by taking into account agents who have since died, changed departments, left the PPC, and the like. I doubt in the span of 1999-2015 the DMS&#39; numbers have dropped from, say, 40,000 to 400 though. Thus, 50 agents is, for the Big Three that would be getting most of the missions, most likely a very small percentage of their effective strength, and at any given point they are very likely to have at least 50 agents able to perform missions. <br><br>Most agent teams consist of two agents, so 50 agents is 25 teams. Let&#39;s give Bob and Alice&#39;s 48 coworkers the exact same workload, three daily missions all year. 25 * (365 * 3) comes out to 27,375 fics killed. At this workrate, the Generic Action Division would wipe out the entire LOTR section of the Pit in about two years, and if you include the entire Tolkienverse (6.7K fics) as one category, they will take about two and a half years to wipe out all three sections. At this workrate, they would have cleansed the entire Hobbit section of the Pit before the badfic explosion was even finished. Now, let&#39;s take into account that not every single fic would be considered worth a mission by Upstairs - some wouldn&#39;t be damaging enough to canon, and some would be outright good. In this hypothetical, if we take LOTR and say half of its entries in the Pit are deemed not in need of a mission, that&#39;s 27,000 fics up for killing, all of which would be dead in this first hypothetical year. <br><br>Now, that&#39;s a very harsh year, but it&#39;s a period of &quot;argh, agents are so overworked&quot; that would be over quite quickly, especially when you consider there are much more than 50 agents out there and these missionable fics would be being distributed all over the place, rather than staying in one specific department. If we take into account there being more than 50, let&#39;s say 100 agents, these 50 agent pairs with the same workload as before have killed 54,750 fics in the first year. If we go even higher, let&#39;s say 2000 agents, 1000 agent pairs have killed 1,095,000 fics in one year (hey, they&#39;re millionaires!). Needless to say huge swathes of the Pit, including the entire Tolkienverse many times over, have been gutted by such a ravenous onslaught, and I would dare say most of the non-Pit sites have taken a beating too. Even at the height of the 2001-2004 badfic boom, I doubt there were a million fics in <i>any</i> continuum to kill. <br><br>Because I said I would, here is how these numbers come out for just one mission a day:<br><br>Bob and Alice: 365 (duh)<br>50 agents: 18,250 (this would take about 3.82 years to wipe out the collective Tolkienverse section on the Pit)<br>100 agents: 365,000 (duh again)<br>2000 agents: 730,000<br><br>Obviously, far fewer fics than three missions a day are being killed, but that&#39;s more than enough to wipe out most sections in short order. It&#39;s still quite a heavy workload, too, but again, not one that would last a long enough time for the badfic supply to be sustainable. In a major badfic boom, maybe fics are coming in faster than they&#39;re being killed, but booms end, and then the remaining fics are still there to be killed off. When even a somewhat modestly sized department of 50 agents can wipe out a whole fandom&#39;s badfic in a year&#39;s work, can we really say agents are still overworked? At any workrate that would qualify for the term, the question seems to be just how there&#39;s any badfic <i>left</i> to kill, especially since it&#39;s taken as a given that the missions we see agents do on page aren&#39;t the only ones they do; it would be patently absurd to suggest only a couple teams have ever done 50 missions in universe, for example. <br><br><b>BUT EKYL...</b><br><br>I know, this is a simplistic model that leaves several variables out, either due to lack of data or just to avoid this whole thing becoming an incomprehensible mess (read: for my own sanity&#39;s sake). Let&#39;s run down a few of them:<br><br>A lot more places than the Pit post fanfic: There&#39;s adultfanfiction.net, AO3, Quotev, people&#39;s blogs, independent sites, forums, etc. etc. etc. - however, this model uses the Pit because it&#39;s the easiest to get data from, AND by far the most popular: the majority of fanfics for a given canon are almost certainly going to be posted on FFnet, even though AO3 is picking up a lot of steam in recent years. If you add on the fanfics in these places, yes, there&#39;s a lot more on the pile, but the agents are still killing a huge number of fics yearly, and when you take my point above that not all fics posted will be deemed killable, the numbers will be dwindling fast.<br><br>Authors will keep writing fanfic/badfic: Yes, true, but how many? At what rate? To sustain a workrate like in this model, fics would have to be written and updated faster than the agents could kill them, and fandom momentum doesn&#39;t sustain that kind of pace for long. The LOTR and Hobbit booms lasted for years but eventually petered out; people still write fics for them, and for Harry Potter, but at nowhere near the rate they used to. Factor in the time it takes for Intel to find fics and determine if they need killing, then to send them to an agent team, and this would see the PPC workload start to slow down immensely. <br><br>Your data is full of assumptions!: By necessity, unfortunately. There&#39;s a lot of stuff here where gathering conclusive data would either be impossible (there&#39;s no way to say for sure exactly how many people are supposed to be in each department, in-universe, for example, just that the PPC as an organisation is much, much larger than the people actively writing characters in it), or more trouble than it&#39;s worth. As such, I put together a reasonably plausible hypothetical and fed data I could get into it to make a point. <br><br>Not every agent would get this many missions: Of course not, though I&#39;d say if you don&#39;t even get one mission a day you&#39;re not that overworked. But anyway, there are agents who wouldn&#39;t get this many missions daily, who wouldn&#39;t complete them quickly enough to stay on top of the pile (or at all, deaths/accidents/failures/snappings-in-actions do happen) or would be unavailable, but the key is that <i>enough</i> agents would be doing these missions to make this impact. If a department has 1000 agents and this workrate, 5% of its effective strength would be killing 27,375/18,250 fics a year. PPC work is demanding enough and dangerous enough that this would easily count as overworking agents, but for how long? <br><br>What about missions that take more than one day: This is tricky, and I&#39;m not sure I have an answer for it now - there&#39;s not really much in the way of data to figure on how in fic time relates to out of fic time, or how long your average agent spends on a mission. There&#39;ve been people who&#39;ve vanished for years doing missions, people who&#39;ve been in mission for a long while then come back at the end and it&#39;s the same day as when they left, and in between; I remember something about Jay saying she&#39;d spent years in missions but came back to HQ not having aged and finding time not having passed, or something like that. It does seem that time outside the Word Worlds moves more slowly than inside, so I consider it possible at least a minority of agents would be able to do three missions in an HST day, although to them it might feel like more or less than that period of time.<br><br>What about reposts: In cases where a fic is reposted, or posted in multiple places... I&#39;m honestly not sure, but I think there might be precedent for this. My personal theory is it stays dead; whatever problem the agents go in to fix serves as the sort of anchor of the author&#39;s influence, and with it dead the word world sort of collapses and/or becomes inaccessible - so the text would still exist but it would be unable to affect the canon any more. This is why fics killed by agents don&#39;t just get deleted, by my estimate. It&#39;s midnight now as I type this so I might not be explaining very well.<br><br>In the PPC multiverse, wouldn&#39;t fics come from more places than just World One: This is actually my (super meta) preferred explanation - surely the LMSF and other Sue-creating organisations make badfic happen too, plus there&#39;s how many alternate Earths out there in this setting? Plus canons that have fictions that people would write fanfic about? A simultaneous fanfic boom from two Earths could produce a terrifying amount of badfic if timing ended up working out. Given what we just calculated for a small percentage of the largest departments, the PPC could handle this, but I could see them getting swamped if there&#39;s enough of it out there. Still, overwork would be a temporary situation, I&#39;d think, because they&#39;d be chewing through fics at an alarming rate given how many more agents there supposedly are than I have included in this model. It could well be that things are slowing down in-universe, though, possibly in response to how much fic has already been killed - the Flowers probably don&#39;t want all their agents to suddenly be out of a job.<br><br>I&#39;m tired now and starting to lose track of all my points, I believe I had more but this is probably good for now. I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll remember more tomorrow and over the weekend in general, but I thought this would be interesting stuff for the Board to chew on! It certainly does give some food for thought.<br><br>...Now I sorta wonder what the PPC would do if one day they ran out of badfic to kill. Which, in an entropic multiverse, I suppose they inevitably will one day. It could maybe be good material for an AU or &quot;the day the consoles stopped beeping&quot; short story.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m in the navy, which is not news to most people these days. Currently I work in deck. There can be made very many not-so-suspicious parallels!<br><br>We do a lot of work and don&#39;t really get extended time off, especially compared to other certain departments (I&#39;m looking at those berks in the personnel office) but it&#39;s not quite as bad as others (engineers, those poor buggers). <br><br>Now, on an underway, there is no way to leave the ship (obviously). You are always On Duty. There are different working hours, as well! <br><br>For example, me? Normal work starts at seven thirty usually. We work until ten thirty am (to go and wait in line for an hour to eat). We get our food and hope it isn&#39;t too alive and that there&#39;s ice in the ice machine and that there is hot sauce to hide the sometimes questionable taste.  I have seen people put hot sauce on things you would normally not put hot sauce on out of sheer desperation.  After eating you hole up somewhere to nap until one PM and then go back to work again until four PM when you go back to the ever present food line and end up putting hot sauce on hot sauce covered chicken. And then you go back to work again for an hour or two after that, so the normal working day ends between seven and eight PM. <br><br>That is not including watch, which is three to five hours of watch which is in shifts that could be during normal working hours to being after or before. When you are not actively working with the department you are usually trying to either catch up on something you were supposed to be working on to get qualified on it or trying to desperately catch up on sleep and not murder the master at arms or legal person who is talking loudly right next to your bed. <br><br>We get the occasional Sunday morning off. Unless you have watch that morning in which case you don&#39;t get a Sunday morning off at all.<br><br>Sometimes we have to wake up at four, even three in the morning to do things that will last the rest of the day anyways, we&#39;re just staring early. <br><br>As you can see this is a lot of time spent working and not very much time for anything else, and maybe overall one night&#39;s full rest every four or five days give or take.<br><br>This is a sane schedule compared to the engineers who are on a five and dime. (Which is I can&#39;t remember the order but I&#39;m pretty sure is five off, ten on.) <br><br>We still goof off, go to the gym, screw around in random spaces, play games, and do things. Like karaoke with the marines. Or fish off the aft end of the ship. Lack of sleep be damned.<br><br>This is not an existence where &quot;days&quot; are a thing, much less &quot;days off&quot;. Everything is hours. <br><br>Common issues cited with the navy is personnel not getting enough sleep, working too much with not enough people, poor retention causing people to leave and never look back and a lack of trust in the leadership.  <br><br>(Sounds familiar no?)<br><br>...anyway, I lost my point a bit. But yes, you can be hideously overworked, sleep deprived,  and hoping your food still isn&#39;t alive and still be able to do things by forcibly making time some way or another. </p>

            <p>Or at least, ridden with different assumptions...<br><br>FF.net gets ~60 fics an hour (that is, the &#39;Just In&#39; page lists 60 items with under one hour since posting. It&#39;s ~40 at 9am UK, rising to ~50 by 3pm; I&#39;m assuming but haven&#39;t checked that it will top 60 when America gets online properly.)<br><br>ASSUME the &#39;good&#39;s in that are balanced out by the &#39;bad&#39;s from other sites.<br><br>That means each week sees (60*24*7) = 10,080 new badfics.<br><br>A mission takes ~ 1 day, internally. Some are shorter, some span multiple days.<br><br>ASSUME that mission-time and HQ-time are roughly synchronised.<br><br>Agents get ~3 hours between missions. Sometimes longer (Medical visits), sometimes the next mission follows immediately. This is basically the time it takes to write a report. Some agents manage to snatch a little sleep.<br><br>Agents seem to have a day&#39;s-worth of down-time every 4-10 missions, depending on the writer. Let&#39;s call it one day a week.<br><br>In one week, an agent can therefore deal with (24*6)/(24+3) = 5 stories<br><br>To <b>keep pace with the influx</b>, the PPC requires (10080 / 5) = 2016 Action teams, thus <b>4032 Action agents</b>.<br><br>If agents are assumed to work five days and have two off, they can only handle 4 stories per week, and the number rises to <b>5040 Action agents</b>.<br><br>To keep pace with the influx, the Department of Intelligence needs to handle 60 fics per hour. An hour seems like a reasonable average time to work through a fic - some require a personal visit and take longer, others are short and take less - so that implies 60 Spies in the Sorting Room per shift. Per (Un)Intelligence, there are six teams, which don&#39;t seem to work simultaneously, implying 360 Sorting Room Spies. The number of Action Spies is much lower: assuming only one fic an hour gets bumped up to them, and allowing six hours for a mission + report, they may only need six! To allow for sleep, assume ten, giving a total of <b>370 Spies</b>.<br><br>hS<br><br>PS: Coming later - comparisons between the two mathsings, including a look at that 60-per-hour figure, and the 50-in-DAVD-fourth-largest one. ~hS</p>

            <p>After that huge post I just made, I plugged your agent numbers for agents needed for 5 and 4 missions weekly, and that many agents doing that much work (2016 * 5 * 52 and 2520 * 4 * 52 [or 5040/2(4*52)) for a year seems to come out to 524,160 fics killed in that year. Still more than enough to wipe out entire fandoms if it&#39;s a slow year. It sounds like enough fics are coming in daily to keep things going, but even the biggest categories on the Pit could get chewed up within a few years if there&#39;s more agents working than the bare minimum suggested number for keeping up.</p>

            <p>I checked out your 60 an hour estimate for fics posted, too, although you said that&#39;s high. 60 * 24 * 365 = 525,600 fics posted to the Pit a year, and that&#39;s presumably fics for more than one continuum. While that&#39;s 1440 fics escaping missions at year&#39;s end if we assume every one of those fics gets targetted, more than the bare minimum number of agents - and we&#39;ve already covered that I think there are more Action agents than you say - and we quickly reach a point where more fics are being killed in a year than are actually being posted.<br><br>Though at that point, of course, we have to factor in all the non-Pit sources of badfic.</p>

            <p>It does cover some blank spots I feel I was leaving, and you have data I either couldn&#39;t get or didn&#39;t think to get. And this is why when you post these things you hope an actual scientist comes by to poke at it. :P I genuinely didn&#39;t think to check how many fics per hour appear on FF.net, or maybe I just didn&#39;t get around to it; I just took the numbers as they currently existed and went &quot;okay, so assume these agents are tackling X number of these fics during an &#39;all hands on deck, constant missions&#39; footing, how many would they chew through assuming what I would personally consider a truly huge workload.&quot; I&#39;d be run ragged if I had to kill three badfics a day! That&#39;s a ballpark figure I took as sort of going &quot;what might a PPC workload look like at its heaviest.&quot;<br><br>4-5 missions a week is still a lot, maybe more than some could handle, and does sound like a heavy enough workload to cause some of the issue we&#39;ve seen in fanfic explosions. However, the question would be if it&#39;s truly the extreme workload that seems to be implied in old missions. Not to trivialise the work a PPC agent has to do, but at this pace it basically turns into a slightly longer, much much more dangerous version of the standard work week. Which I guess fits right in with the workplace humour. I do think 1000-10,000 action agents (I&#39;m replying to both of your posts in this one to save time) figure might be lowballing it a little, but it does work as a good &quot;let&#39;s assume there are at least this many agents out there killing fics, to keep up with how many are posted daily&quot; figure. I suppose it depends, in part, on if you figure that&#39;s a number per action department, or for EVERY action department; 10,000 agents is still a lot of people, but I dunno. <br><br>To get back to actual numbers, I would say 4-5 a week would possibly work as a ballpark estimate for the average number of missions tackled by an agent team (some people get more, some people get less, and when there&#39;s a huge fanfic boom everyone&#39;s doing everything as fast as they can possibly do &#39;em) considering the general &quot;things have slowed down a bit&quot; vibe I get from recent stuff and that there&#39;s still a lot of fic out there to kill. Though I still think a look at a PPC that realises there&#39;s no fanfic left to kill would be interesting one day, and it does seem to me that they&#39;re capable of taking out a truly immense amount of fics when they have to. Of course, 208/260 missions a year per team feels much more reasonable than tens of thousands of missions like if agents are getting multiple missions daily. I do think the difference in these figures actually suggests, especially since I personally prefer the four-a-week-with-two-days-or-so-off model for the modern, &quot;nothing is currently exploding&quot; PPC, that the agents could have it much much worse than they do. <br><br>On DAVD: Yes, I&#39;d remembered before going to bed that a discussion about their numbers happened years ago and you had said pretty definitively that there obviously weren&#39;t still only 50 agents when they became the fourth largest Action Department. I used 50 as a marker because a) it&#39;s a rare department where we have an actual number for how many of them there are in-universe, so I didn&#39;t have to pull a number completely from my hat, and b) we can then point to it and say there are 50 people here going into the Word Worlds and killing badfic on a regular basis. 50, in the original post, was my minimum &quot;we can assume a given action department, at least among the major departments, will have at least 50 agents available for missions at any given point in time.&quot; I do think it&#39;s odd that a major department like DIC would have less people in it than DAVD, say, but Floaters has probably taken a lot of workload from departments like DIC and APD. I imagine there&#39;s a lot of departments that only still exist to give the Department Head a job.<br><br>This data and the conclusions you come to also support a thought I&#39;ve always had, namely that there&#39;s probably many more agents in the infrastructure and support departments (think Intel, Finance, Personnel, Operations, DIA...) than Action. This makes perfect sense, because the logistical needs of this place are immense; in every army, 9/10 or so of the soldiers are working behind the lines. This would do something for addressing the huge implicit numbers of agents without completely stripping the Worlds bare, though some of the Action Departments are probably big enough to be doing a real number on what&#39;s out there.<br><br>Admittedly, our two models rely on some different assumptions that could make the resultant data go wildly off course. How does mission time <i>really</i> relate to HQ time? How many missions really come down in what an agent might recognise as a 24 hour period? What&#39;s the difference between an agent&#39;s perceived time and the time that actually passes? Yours says mission time matches up more or less with HQ time and each mission takes about a day as a ballpark guess, mine says missions seem to vary and not everyone seems to experience the same amount of time in mission as passes outside the Word World. Admittedly, yours gets pretty specific, whereas mine basically goes, &quot;let&#39;s assume it&#39;s possible for at least some agent teams to get multiple missions within one HST day and complete them all, and see how many they&#39;d chew through in a year if this happened every day&quot;.<br><br>I think we can say that given what&#39;s suggested from both our models, there&#39;s definitely enough missions going on within a short enough timeframe for your average agent to <i>feel</i> overworked and like there&#39;s no end in sight, and whether or not they truly are that put upon is a matter of interpretation. It does seem like things are better now than they were in Jay and Acacia&#39;s day, where I bet Intel really couldn&#39;t keep up because so many people were posting so many things at once - it would explain current missions being posted using old fics, if that&#39;s backlog being cleared because Intel finally got to that fic, although in universe the 2001-2003 fics are almost all surely dead by now. It could definitely vary between department, division, and individual agent; there&#39;s probably busy areas, and divisions for fandoms that&#39;re extremely quiet because there&#39;s hardly ever fics worth killing any more, plus my assumption that maybe more fics are being written in-universe than we see here. A DMS Tolkienverse or Harry Potter agent team is probably busier than, say, the entire APD Mossflower Division or DMFF, especially from 2001-2004 and 2011-2014 (creeping into 2015 because there&#39;s still a lot of Hobbit fic being written - there weren&#39;t 11,000 fics in the Hobbit section this time last year). Floaters, the poor sods, probably get the most work due to having the most agents and the least specialisation. This would allow for what you said, that there&#39;s room for things to shuffle around either way - while your typical agent probably feels overworked, and really does see quite a lot of missions, I doubt things are quite so bad as, say, never having any time to relax or recover. For one, we see a lot of stories lately that have them doing exactly that; would Rudi&#39;s or the Pennacook Club or A Troupe By Any Other Name or the businesses in New Caledonia or the Multiverse Monitor exist if nobody ever had time to run the show or be a patron? <br><br>(That does raise a question though: what does a badfic do when nobody&#39;s killing it? I seem to recall reading somewhere it just sorta loops over and over until someone shows up to deal with it but does it hurt the canon worse? Is there any particular effect if an author finishes their fic before the PPC gets to it? These are outside the scope of this model and discussion, but something to ponder.)<br><br>For their purposes, though, I think both calculations are serviceable - namely, to allow for this discussion and to look at what it might actually look like to be an agent. How busy is the PPC, really? What kind of progress are they actually making? Maybe more than we thought, or less, depending on which data you like better, and either set of numbers shows how daunting a task is ahead of someone who takes this job. With so many badfics to face, no wonder turnover can be pretty high. I guess in the end it&#39;s sort of the Batman situation. Batman has cleaned up the streets of Gotham considerably, by now, in many interpretations, but there&#39;s always going to be crime, and his rogues gallery will always be out there causing mayhem, because as long as people want to write and read Batman stories there has to be a villain for him to face.</p>

            <p>60 stories per hour may be a bit high. Right now I count 33, so perhaps the 40 was closer to representative than I thought.<br><br>More interestingly, FF.net splits its New Stories by Stories and Crossovers. That 33 is 30 stories, 3 crossovers; that means that, to keep pace, roughly 10% of PPC Action agents must be either Implausible Crossovers, Floaters on Crossover duty, or dealing with crossovers as a secondary charge.<br><br>Now: DAVD. DAVD had only a handful of (Action) agents left in 2006. By 2009, they were back to 49 Action agents, and ~66 total. By 2012 (another three years), they were the fourth-largest.<br><br>Assuming linear growth - which doesn&#39;t seem unreasonable, since DAVD are leaching off general PPC recruitments, rather than running their own - it seems reasonable to assume that 2012 figure was about 100 agents. That means that DMS-DF-DBS have over 100 each, and that - yes - most departments have less. Well, how many DMFF agents did you <i>think</i> there were?<br><br>And my figures are for <b>keeping pace</b>. IS the PPC keeping up with badfic production? Are they ahead and eating through the backlog? Are they lagging behind? We don&#39;t know; there&#39;s room enough to shuffle the numbers either way.<br><br>I think the conclusions from this have to be:<br><br>1/ PPC Agents do a hard, dangerous job, with not enough time between missions to relax, and not enough time off to recover.<br><br>2/ There are somewhere between 1000 and 10,000 Action agents, probably towards the lower end of that scale.<br><br>3/ The biggest departments number in the mid-to-high hundreds; the smaller ones are in the tens.<br><br>4/ The Department of Intelligence is one of the largest in HQ.<br><br>5/ There will be work enough, and unfamiliar faces enough, for the PPC for many decades to come - because we&#39;ll keep on writing it. ^_^<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Multiple missions a day might seem to be feasible from an outside perspective, but a lot of missions seem to last multiple days.  Even in TOS, Jay and Acacia frequently have to make camp or find somewhere to sleep.  Now, given that the PPC&#39;s temporal mechanics are... complicated, a mission could theoretically only take about two or three hours of Headquarters time (HQT) but several days of Agent time (AT).  Heck, a mission could theoretically take <i>no</i> time, with the agents returning only a few seconds of HQT later than when they left, but with a cumulative AT of a week.  With that kind of system, it&#39;s easy to feel overworked even if you only get a mission every other day.<br><br>In general, I imagine most PPC agents, rather than the typical nine-to-five pattern, tend to work extremely long &quot;shifts&quot; with relatively neglible time off between them.  It might not look like much from an outside perspective, but most of them put in far more than 40 man-hours of work a week, at least in terms of AT.  </p>

            <p>There&#39;s more to &#39;overworked&#39; than workload. The agents get no breaks (Ironic Overpower, anybody?), the food is bad (hello, Slorp), and missions are, for the most part, very stressful; I think those factors all contribute to the feeling of overworked-ness, as they all serve to make an agent feel that they don&#39;t have time to breath.<br></p>

            <p>Namely, this was me taking a ballpark figure for how many missions might be coming in to create the feeling of constant work with no breaks ever. Especially when you consider that there&#39;s only so much a pair can do before they&#39;ve just been run into the ground by the workload. <br><br>And don&#39;t get me started on Slorp, that took maybe half an hour to get thoroughly run into the ground. :P<br><br>I will admit that I personally assume things have gotten better/slowed down a bit in HQ compared to the Great Fanfic Explosion, but then, Tolkienverse agents will have only recently finished riding out the smaller fanfic boom (&quot;only&quot; 11,000 fics at the time of this writing) caused by the Hobbit movies. This also isn&#39;t something pulled out of my hat randomly, but going off the vibe I get in a lot of stories lately - the &quot;oh [diety of your choice], we literally never get any breaks ever and everything is horrible and somehow I haven&#39;t died from starvation or sleep deprivation&quot; seems to have fallen aside, especially since there&#39;s a lot of alternatives to the Cafeteria these days. We see enough stories of agents just hanging out and doing their thing, or at least not being completely buried in missions 24/7, that it seems to indicate the old status quo is no longer, well, quo.</p>

            <p>Since this thread is about Badfics, I think I&#39;ll take this opportunity to ask something I&#39;ve been wondering for a while now.<br><br>Has anybody read the Sonichu comics? Everyone knows what those are, right? (Please tell me I&#39;m not the only one who read them.)Well, they&#39;re a series of webcomics, so I was wondering if those fall under what the PPC does. <br><br>Not saying that I want to work with them.

            <p>They&#39;ve come up in passing before, and I think general opinion is that they&#39;re not exactly our jurisdiction.  We don&#39;t really do fan comics in general, and frankly, Sonichu is only fan anything by the very skin of its teeth.  That, combined with just how entwined it is with the life of its creator and the sheer level of badness it entails, means that we&#39;re unlikely to touch it at any point.  Plus, it&#39;s already been thoroughly torn to pieces by a number of sources, I don&#39;t know that we need to do it, too.</p>

            <p>The worst part of the &quot;cosplayer becomes their character for real&quot; trend is that I don&#39;t automatically hate it.  You could get a lot of good identity issues out of it, as the main character finds themselves trapped in a body that they know isn&#39;t theirs but still is, maybe dealing with instincts and memories that are simultaneously foreign and natural to them.  But instead of actually doing anything with that premise, it&#39;s just poorly integrated into a MLP fic and used as an excuse for Stu powers.<br><br>And that last one... ugh.  I really cannot stand the trend of bronies (or other fans of children&#39;s series, I suppose, but I see it the most with bronies) glorying in darkening and corrupting an innocent continuum.  All I can think is, <i>why</i>?  Nobody&#39;s making you like MLP.  You could always take part in some darker, more mature fandom if that&#39;s what you want.  Like it or not, MLP is a kid&#39;s show, and I don&#39;t understand why the so-called fans can&#39;t respect that.</p>

            <p>Elsa being melded with Grey is horrifying enough, especially considering the author&#39;s managed to capture some of Hellspawn&#39;s personality (I know this canon via the Das Sporking LJ, hence the... nickname), but I went in thinking that Anna Steele was, well, *Ana* Steele. As in, crossover, not creepy, creepy fusion. I&#39;m out. No sense in scarring myself and my agents that badly.<br><br>I can, however, tell you that this is absolutely horrible and all of my nope. Elsa alone is awful. &quot;I WEAR SUITS&quot; (more silly than horrible) and her *thought process* and good grief, even her father is OOC and that&#39;s just a flashback...<br><br>I will say one thing, which is that at least with this version of Grey I get some sense that she&#39;s gotten tired of the routine of her job instead of just plain whining and never doing much of anything. Some kudos to the author for that. Still creepy, and Elsa!Grey isn&#39;t much better than original Grey (who for the full name of Gaston Hellspawn Bedbug over at Das Sporking), but it&#39;s a very, very slight improvement.<br><br>But yeah, no, not taking this /shudders/ Not with that pairing. Which is fine by me--I don&#39;t want to know how OOC Anna will get. She&#39;s many things, but she is nowhere near the character of Ana Steele. Good luck to anyone who does take it, though.<br><br>~DF</p>

Suspicion and anticipation surrounding the unusual activity attributed to fabled artist and provocateur Banksy has reached a Willy Wonka-esque fervor. Well, if Banksy’s your bag, continue fervoring. If not, there’s more than a few reasons to continue reading.<br><br>&quot;The spectacle has since been revealed to be a pop-up art exhibition in the form of an apocalyptic theme park titled Dismaland (“The UK’s most disappointing new visitor attraction”) that will be open to the public for five weeks.<br><br>&quot;The event has all the hallmark details of a traditional Banksy event from its initial shroud of secrecy to artistic themes of apocalypse, anti-consumerism, and pointed social critiques on celebrity culture, immigration, and law enforcement. However, there’s one major deviation: the bulk of the artwork packed into three main interior galleries was created by dozens of other artists.<br><br>&quot;So just what’s hidden inside the walls of this derelict seaside resort? A demented assortment of bizarre and beautiful artworks from no less than 58 global artists including Damien Hirst, Jenny Holzer, Jimmy Cauty, Bill Barminski, Caitlin Cherry, Polly Morgan, Josh Keyes, Mike Ross, David Shrigley, Bдst, and Espo. Banksy is also showing 10 artworks of his own.<br><br>&quot;Dismaland features a cavalcade of artists featured here on Colossal over the last few years including pieces by Escif, Maskull Lasserre, Kate McDowell, Paco Pomet, Dietrich Wegner, Michael Beitz, Brock Davis, Ronit Baranga, and others.&quot;</i><br><br>I know this was posted more than a week ago, but I thought it would be worth sharing anyway.<br><br>Oh, and my brother&#39;s response when I showed this to him?<br><br><strike>ABANDONED BY DISNEY</strike><br><br><b>A̻͉̪̞̙̩B̼̭͖̩̺Á̺̤̺̮̣͉͕͎̱͝N͕̙͉͜͟͞D̳̻͔̻Ơ̯̦̥̫͈͠ͅN͏̠͎͚̣͇̜E̫̯̳̻̠̘̠ͅD̩̘̰̙́͞ ̛̳̙̯̫̰̜̙͝B̴̷̥̳̜̝͕̜̗͞Ỳ̵̼̗̤ͅ ̴̲̝̫̣̝̜̟̪ͅG̥̞̜͜O̶̴͎͉͎D҉̶̙̣̬̱͎͠ͅ</b></p>

            <p>If you have not read this story yet, I highly, highly recommend you read it. This is a story that could, and should, be read by everybody. Wonderfully chilling, beautifully crafted, and a buildup that make you long for more. While I was disappointed by the ending (which I will not spoil) it does not sour the experience one bit. In fact, the ending is rather good. Just... Not where I thought the story was going. I consider this not just the best SCP, but one of the best short stories I personally have read. Seriously, read it. All of you. You will not regret it.<br><br>The Nightclub one was interesting. I like how the Foundation has got the scripts down to a science, learning how to save the most people possible, even down to being able to save the vast majority most times. This is a great example of how to show through telling. The implications, the holes filled in the mind as to how, exactly, the Foundation learned these scripts so thoroughly. Very well crafted story.<br><br>Hanged King&#39;s Tragedy is a play that, were I a better playwright then I am, I would be tempted to take a swing at writing the &#39;original play.&#39; It definitely reads like a summary to a lost Shakespeare play. It took very clear inspiration from Macbeth, which while it does not have a singular figure haunting the play like this one, is infamous for being a cursed production seeped in blood. The juxtaposition between the bloody and deadly haunted production, and the grim humor of the written script makes the ghost all the more terrifying then the mere haunting would have by itself. While not as good for me as 93 or 453, it is still one of the better stories on the site.<br><br>Who doesn&#39;t love Josie? Not all SCPs have to kill you or end the world or something, they just have to be weird. Of the &quot;lighthearted SCP&#39;s&quot;, I&#39;m a fan of the <a href="http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-387">Box of Legos</a>. A box full of living Lego that just wants to build? What more do you want! So glad they let it just be cute for what it is. The ending was particularly good.</p>

            <p>This is really well written and well researched. I think it is important to raise awareness around representation of autism on all fronts, including fiction. Though I have not encountered them myself, I too have heard about the misrepresentation and steriotypes affecting autistic characters. <br><br>I think that maybe you could continue to delve into this issue by analysing both good and bad examples in depth to show what should and shouldn&#39;t be done. <br><br>For good examples in published fiction, I can offer Max Braverman from the TV series <a href="http://www.nbc.com/parenthood">Parenthood</a> and Hikaru Azuma from the manga <a href="http://www.yenpress.com/with-the-light/">With The Light</a> <br><br>On the fanfiction side of things, both Riko Tasogare from <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10288703/1/Twilight-Pretty-Cure">Twilight Pretty Cure</a> and Chika Senri from <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10057836/1/Puzzle-Hunt-Precure">Puzzle Hunt Precure</a> have been praised for providing good portrayals of neurodiverse characters.</p>

            <p>This is well-done! I think I&#39;ve known I was autistic for a  few years now (though good luck getting parents to believe that - when I was in middle school I had a test for that and autism was disqualified on the basis that I was capable of making jokes/conversation, which... ugh.) <br><br>The only thing I can think of that might be worth elaborating more on is the fact that being autistic and happy are not mutually exclusive (and not happy in the too-dumb-to-be-otherwise sense.) Because a lot of people seem to think that autism is a permanent misery for everyone involved, except when it&#39;s ~*INSPIRATIONAL*~. </p>

            <p>He is all my good and bad points writ large, including my autism.<br><br>I have Asperger&#39;s, and thus Valon does as well. I&#39;m very high-functioning, and I&#39;m normal for the most part. The things that stick out are my lack of common sense and the fact that my mind is incredibly surreal (reread my fourth mission). Also the fact that I am very inept in social settings, and prefer to be alone, sometimes with a friend or two.<br><br>The only way I can tolerate more people is if they&#39;re all weirdos like me, or if they share one of my obsessions. Pathfinder, for instance.</p>

            <p>Story time: my first serious boyfriend was a sweet guy. He was shy, but he loved hanging out with his friends; we and a mutual buddy got together one Halloween to dress up in menacing robes and scare little kids. ^^; Lots of fun.<br><br>He was a very talented saxophone player, and a fan of the Beatles; he drove everyone in band crazy by constantly playing &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot; during individual warmups (though the one time he didn&#39;t, everyone freaked out, heh heh). He was a huge <i>Lord of the Rings</i> fan and an avid <i>Minecraft</i> player. He had two dogs that he loved, a little sister (who... actually ended up dating my little brother for a few months, that was cute. But weird. But also cute.), and very nice parents. <br><br>All in all, a pretty normal guy. He is also autistic, and I didn&#39;t find out until about a year and a half after we broke up. <br><br>My brother was also tested for autism and he narrowly avoided being diagnosed with Asberger&#39;s, and he later told me he cheated because he didn&#39;t want to be labeled a &#39;crazy&#39; like me. So it&#39;s very possible I have an autistic brother as well. Aside from liking to make hilariously inappropriate jokes at the worst possible times, he&#39;s also pretty normal. Very smart kid, straight As, lots and lots of Advanced Placement classes, plays tennis for the varsity team, and he&#39;s built himself a couple of robots as well. He loves to play <i>World of Warcraft</i> and <i>Minecraft</i>, and he has the D&amp;D fourth edition Monster Manual memorized. <br><br>You wouldn&#39;t look at this stuff and say &quot;Aha! Autistic!&quot; You&#39;d say &quot;Yeah, he&#39;s a geek.&quot;<br><br>My dad has a friend whose son (a few years older than me) is also autistic, and the only clue to people who don&#39;t know is that he sometimes has to get away from a loud party by going to a separate room. And considering I&#39;m the same way, albeit for different reasons, it&#39;s not a massive tip-off by itself.<br><br>Tl;dr, you can&#39;t always tell. :)</p>

            <p>You know how they talk about an &quot;autism epidemic&quot; and all that? Most of that is new diagnosis in mild cases, which beforehand would not have been diagnosed because the disability associated with it is mild and the individual usually only needs intermittent support. The other part of it is the decrease in intellectual disability (UK would call it &quot;learning disability&quot;) cases, which are increasingly being recognized as autism. So, increasing awareness has put autism in the public eye, and of course they will be writing about it.<br><br>I went undiagnosed until 23 years old, myself, though that was mostly because my mom (who as an occupational therapist had worked with autistic children) was so paranoid of having me &quot;labled&quot; that she took me out of school to avoid evaluations. That and because if I stayed in, sooner or later someone would believe me about what things were like at home. Let&#39;s just say I&#39;m glad to be on my own, hey? :)<br><br>The trouble with writing about autism is that we&#39;re just at the beginning of working specifically for autism rights/autism acceptance, and that much of the &quot;awareness&quot; out there is fear/pity hype. So you get a subject that a lot of people are thinking about, but about which there&#39;s not a lot of unembellished, everyday-life information. The result is skewed characterization and messed-up writing from authors who don&#39;t do their research.</p>

            <p>Is first figuring out where on the autistic spectrum they fall, and how it will affect their work. Taking the PPC as an example, someone severely autistic would be completely unsuitable for work in an action department, but might find a calling in one of the quieter bits of DoSAT or FicPsych. Whatever they want, really. Contrast someone who &quot;only&quot; has Asperger&#39;s Syndrome; it would be interesting to see how someone like that can function in an action department.<br><br>Of course, in a comedy setting, it&#39;s trickier - you don&#39;t want to make jokes about other people&#39;s suffering.</p>

            <p>The way action departments work is &quot;withstand the fic, read charges, kill the Sue/exorcise the canons/etc.,&quot; right?<br><br>So. Imagine that hypothetical Agent Dinah here is autistic. She has sensory problems, is nonverbal, and wouldn&#39;t be able to handle the stress of combat.<br><br>But she can still kill a Sue. She wears headphones and uses the Words as subtitles if she needs to, uses sign language to talk to her partner, and her partner reads the charges at the end before Dinah drops our little Sue into our volcano with her RA. Furthermore, if the canon is one of her special interests, she probably knows it very well.<br><br>Yes, she probably relies on her partner for a lot of things. But that doesn&#39;t mean she&#39;s unsuitable. <br><br>(Also, Asperger&#39;s Syndrome is just autism now. It&#39;s a somewhat outdated diagnosis, and while some people still identify with it. And... I&#39;m sorta concerned that you&#39;re saying that we&#39;re suffering here. Please tell me that that&#39;s just me reading it badly! :P )<br><br></p>

            <p>I mean, for one thing &#39;severely&#39; autistic is generally a useless measurement. Do you mean someone nonverbal? Because that really wouldn&#39;t interfere as long as their partner understood them. And they could be affected more by Sue phenomenons, but then there are a lot of Agents who have heightened senses that are bothered by that kind of thing.<br><br>Also, don&#39;t <i> most </i> Agents work in &#39;whatever they want&#39;? I mean, there doesn&#39;t seem to be too much in the way of someone transferring departments as a matter of course.<br><br>...We make jokes about people&#39;s suffering all the time.

            <p>I have some little nitpicks...<br>First, Voyd, the Nyan Cat Song, is actually a sped up version of &quot;Nyanyanya!&quot; by Hatsune Miku, so it actually doesn&#39;t say &quot;Meowmeow...&quot;<br><br>And Skarm... I have some issues with the way Lapis speaks. Is she using fangirl japanese, or is she supposed to be a native Japanese speaker trying to speak English? Because, if it&#39;s the first one, that rubs me the wrong way, and if it&#39;s the second, is done wrongly and feels offensive. Take your pick.<br><br>And... which continuum was the host continuum? The Little Mermaid or Pirates?<br>Because if it was the former, guys... I have bad news for you.  Guys, you pretty much kidnapped Davy Jones, his crew and the kraken from their native continuum and plopped them into another without returning them home.<br><br>If it was the latter... well, I have bad news too. Guys, you also got a Geographical Aberration, as two non-canonical locations would have been plopped into the world of Pirates of the Caribbean, and you forgot to send back all the canons from The Little Mermaid, back to their Woooooorld~ (heheheh)<br><br>Aside from that, I found the Mission enjoyable and entertaining. <br><br>Also Voyd, there&#39;s something that Skarm and me have to speak with you, but that should better be left for G-Hangouts.</p>

            <p>I threw in the Japanese in the first draft because I always figured she was bilingual (what with the Pokemon anime being Japanese and then dubbed in English).

            <p>Interesting interaction between your characters, and even if the badfic was boring as all get-out, at least the mission was a page-turner, metaphorically speaking. I wonder what the future holds for Cupid and Stephanie.<br><br>Well, you literally asked for it, so here&#39;s what I caught:<br><br>1) <i>She closed her eyes and concentrated; in a flash of color, she suddenly looked like a deluxe-sized, female Cupid.</i><br>You make it seem as if she transformed into an angel instead of changing color. Try something like this:<br> She closed her eyes and concentrated; in a flash of color, she suddenly looked like a deluxe-sized, female Cupid, albeit wingless and with tentacles for legs.<br><br>2) <i>There you are, you had me so worried!</i><br>Technically ungrammatical (replace the comma with a semicolon), but it might work if you actually intended for Lapis to say her lines that quickly.<br><br>3) <i>I am in fact the first boss of the game, the Mantis Ant.</i><br>Is Chakkik supposed to be the selfsame character, or is he just the same <i>species</i> as the boss?<br><br>4) <i>Disguise-Outfitting Ryticular Costume System.</i><br>Ironically, you&#39;re misspelling something by using the correct spelling. &quot;Costume&quot; here is to be spelled with a &quot;K&quot;, not a &quot;C&quot;, hence the acronym D.O.R.K.S.<br><br>5) <i>blue dorsal/anal fins</i><br>Replace the comma with the word &quot;and.&quot;<br><br>6) <i>[Cupid] had large, flowing fins where his wings would be as an angel. Or, in this case, an angelfish.</i><br>I suggest that you delete the last sentence. I don&#39;t think that angefish have such fins. Besides, you already mentioned his dorsal (back) fin a few sentences earlier, so these fins would be in addition to that one.<br><br>7) <i>Taking out the (thankfully waterproof) RA, Cupid put a hand to his ear, delighted to realize that the sound of the Words travelled much further while underwater.</i><br>Huh? Unless I&#39;m mistaken, agents can only <i>see</i> the Words, and that by unfocusing their eyes. I&#39;d suggest deleting this sentence and replacing it with something else indicating that he was checking the Words.<br><br>8) <i>I am no scion of Sylph.</i><br>Misspelling. The name of that particular spirit in Secret of Mana is &quot;Sylphid&quot;, not &quot;Sylph&quot;.<br><br>9) <i>“Wait, him? So, you like guys or something?”</i><br>Just a style suggestion, but put &quot;him&quot; in quotes or italicize it.<br><br>10) <i>The last time I brought the subject to my orientation, my companion at the time had a panic attack.</i><br>Should be &quot;The last time I brought up the subject <b>of</b> my orientation&quot;.<br><br>11) <i>Stephanie might have been an eleven-foot kraken, but she remained an octopus,</i><br>That should be &quot;part octopus&quot;<br><br>12) <i>The agents poked their heads out of the water, staring in morbid fascination at the sight of an unidentified pirate captain declaring that Undertow was <b>“you’re new master”</b> before giving him some kind of amulet.</i><br>As much as I like picking on badfics&#39; lack of grammar, you&#39;re actually amiss. Here&#39;s the context:<br><br><b>&quot;Are you the Undertow?&quot; the captain asked.<br><br>&quot;Yeah,&quot; replied Undertow. &quot;Who&#39;s asking?&quot;<br><br>He then sees the captain smiling as the human uses his sword and moves it close to the shark&#39;s throat. &quot;You&#39;re new master.</b><br><br>Your/you&#39;re error aside, it&#39;s clear that the pirate captain was calling himself Undertow&#39;s new master. A quick fix is in order: &quot;The agents poked their heads out of the water, staring in morbid fascination at the sight of an unidentified pirate captain declaring to Undertow that he was <b>“you’re new master”</b> before giving him some kind of amulet.&quot;<br><br>13) <i>The kraken looked puzzled. “Why, what does Cupid have to do?”</i><br>Try this instead: &quot;Why? And what does Cupid have to do?&quot;<br><br>14) &quot;James&quot; came right out of nowhere; I do not recall him being in the badfic. Where did he come from?<br><br>15) I know that Lapis said that she&#39;d only keep one pov, but she sent two to HQ via the same portal. Where&#39;s the Normal pov?<br><br>16) <i>We can buy them from the Armory with our own pay!</i><br>Pay? What pay?</p>

            <p>1) Good call, I&#39;ll pop that in.<br><br>3) He IS the Mantis Ant.

            <p>2) I&#39;ll keep things as is here, since Lapis tends to speak rather quickly when flustered.<br><br>6) The angelfish pun was intentional but I guess I kinda forced it in this line. The wing fins are also an unnecessary addition, so I got rid of them in the text.<br><br>7) The reason I chose the listening option is because Cupid can&#39;t read, and I always thought he&#39;d listen to the Words instead. There is another illiterate agent, Unger, but I don&#39;t know how he handled the Words on his missions (as his partner usually led them). I replaced it with just checking the Words, though, to leave it deliberately unclear.<br><br>15) She probably sent it to where POVs are sent by default.

            <p>Your agents and their interactions are hilarious.<br><br>Unfortunately, there is apparently a continuity error:<br><i>“Oh, yeah, I forgot about you guys!” she said, opening a portal and sending the povs to HQ.</i><br><br><i>Lapis began breathing fast, hugging both her pov and her monkey so tightly that it was hard for them to breathe.</i><br>Either the sending to HQ should not have happened, or this pov should not be there. (Was &quot;Melody’s pov&quot; dragged back when the badfic changed point of view again? We should have seen Lapis’s reaction to this event. The &quot;Normal pov&quot; may have respawned with &quot;The Artic&quot; on page 22, but then it should be with Stephanie and Cupid. Also, I wonder what the Artic looks like and why it causes coldness.)<br><br><i>The agents (and their companion<b>s</b>) fell silent, watching the fic play out.</i><br>As far as we know, Triton the Oshawott should be Lapis and Chakkik’s only companion at this time. <br><br><i>Then she opened a portal before leading Chakkik, Triton, and the povs to the same little beach as before.</i><br>As far as we know, the povs should not be there.<br><br>Also, there is a weird sentence:<br><i>Chakkik silently killed more of the Generic Pirates, avoiding Deadnite and Titus until it was absolutely necessary.</i><br>I see what you mean there, but isn’t that what was absolutely necessary in the end the opposite of &quot;avoiding Deadnite and Titus&quot;?<br><br><i>... Chris could only watch helplessly as the tentacle that had captured him <b>from</b> lifted him a hundred feet above the sinking ship ...</i><br>Either one word too much or some words missing?<br><br><i>And as Christopher Sparrow screamed <b>his last,</b> Davy Jones’ Kraken dragged the remains of Captain Deadnite’s ship, and every single one of its remaining crew members, down into the depths of the deep, dark, Scandinavian sea.</i><br>Missing word? I’m not entirely sure whether, in English, it is necessary to specify whether this was his last word or his last scream or whatever. (In German, the sentence would work as it stands, if &quot;last&quot; were capitalized to show that it is used like a noun and meant to be the sentences object rather than an adjective to this object.)<br><br><i>On that note, I <b>would to extend</b> a hand –</i><br>Missing word?<br><br>HG</p>

            <p>This is a general announcement that the Body-Switch RP is <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=241484;article=5772;title=PPC%20Message%20Board">open!</a><br><br><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/135mjJwLnFIuQj_7I9y-3dNMpwRCV5BWp9UIVtW46eAI/pub">Here</a> is the opening story, because, after all, something had to have happened at the first. <br><br>And for those who haven’t seen it, the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PX71AtfFz6HkUXS4rrr8ympOR54L9N_x0X8Si8kQhy0/edit#gid=0">spreadsheet</a> is now updated with all the randomized swaps.<br><br>Characters who were <i>not</i> affected are, again, totally allowed to join in! There are plenty of reasons as to why a character would not be affected; after all, HQ is a big place and agents do go on missions! Boarders who do not yet have permission are also welcome to join in, just remember we’re keeping an eye on you. ;)<br><br>I’ll have rules reiterated in each thread as needed, but again, I’m going to emphasize the most important one: <b>Don’t break other people’s characters’ bodies.</b><br><br>And as for how the bodyswapping will work...<br><br>Characters will suddenly find themselves inhabiting the bodies of the whomever they were swapped with. This will be quite sudden and without warning. <br><br>Characters who have body-related powers will find themselves without said powers. Mental abilities will remain (except limited by the body)- psychic characters like, say, the Flowers are going to be quite displeased with the situation (not that they’d be pleased in the first place). Characters who find themselves inhabiting the bodies of characters who have powers will be able to get some very poor control over them (which could potentially be a bad thing) but will have to put quite a bit of effort into it!<br><br>If you have any further questions, feel free to ask here.<br><br>Feel free to bounce ideas and planning off in here as well among yourselves. </p>

            <p>OK, a broadsword is more Skeet&#39;s style, although he&#39;s still probably going to want to try and pick up his own weapons :)<br><br>As for the eyes, Skeet was brought up as a Christian, and probably defaults to it, although he&#39;s not a particularly religious person. So I&#39;m guessing it would be very occasional flashes of blue? Would I be right in thinking that any &#39;Goddamnit&#39;s or other such minor blasphemies would result in flashes of red?

            <p>The eyes don&#39;t respond to momentary things like that; they&#39;re blue, green, or red, period. I&#39;m not quite sure if Skeet would have blue or green eyes. If, as the verse goes, he has &quot;confessed with his mouth the Lord Jesus, and believe that God has raised Him from the dead,&quot; he will have blue eyes. In Alleble, it&#39;s called making the Good Confession. <br><br>In the end, I&#39;ll leave the decision up to you; green or blue. </p>

            <p>Basically, yeah, Gurnirel&#39;s not affected (because Laws of Narrative Comedy) and would be with him. I&#39;d love to rp her in that situation, which is why I put only Naergondir on the list.<br><br>There are also a few things you should know about Naergondir--I don&#39;t know what you know about LotR and the Silm, but he&#39;s a Noldorin Elf from the First Age who normally speaks Sindarin and prefers to speak Quenya. He and Gurnirel have probably learned enough English by now to read the Words, but I doubt they use it very frequently--they rely on translators, which usually work with Sindarin (unless they don&#39;t, in which case they have to deal with that and it&#39;s amusing). What this means is that...well, Gurnirel will be very confused and Amy might have trouble pronouncing some things/find that speaking English feels a bit clumsy.<br><br>Their RC (1500) is full of plants and trees, beyond the requisite tech and weapons. I don&#39;t know if this extends to any private rooms they might have. Both of them are...I believe it&#39;s seven feet tall. Naergondir has long dark hair which he puts a lot of braids in; Gurnirel&#39;s hair is golden (she&#39;s got some Vanyarin blood) and she tends more to just braid back what&#39;s near her face. Both of them have grey eyes, and are very, very likely to be wearing elven clothes--Naergondir might well be in blue robes, Gurnirel in something dark red and slightly more practical. Once they get a translator working, she&#39;ll sound pretty formal.<br><br>They&#39;ve been friends for a very long time, and are close to the point of calling each other by words meaning &#39;sworn brother&#39; and &#39;sworn sister&#39; (as opposed to blood kin). They also have extra names which they&#39;ve given each other, such as Meldaner for Naergondir, and they tend to use them...about half the time, I think? Maybe most of the time? It&#39;s a bit hard to calculate.<br><br>Both work in SIELU, and have been agents since mid-2013.<br><br>And I think that&#39;s the entire infodump. I wouldn&#39;t mind knowing how much you and Amy know about this pair&#39;s home canon, and I should probably look up more about Amy (only her name sounds familiar, annoyingly), but this is likely more than enough to be getting on with. If I managed to miss something that you want or need to know, just ask!<br><br>~DF</p>

            <p>To you, that is.<br><br>I&#39;m definitely interested in that. I...forget exactly what I was thinking earlier today, but I&#39;m pretty sure he&#39;d be confused, worried, and probably go try to find his partner--I assume with Vania along to keep an eye on *her* partner&#39;s body. You&#39;ve certainly got a First Age Elf basically freaking out because he might be stuck as a human (who is, typically, shorter than he is). I mean--he survived the entire First Age, got tossed into the PPC, and now he has to lose his body as well? And...who&#39;s in *his* body? They might even assume Doc is there with Gurnirel...<br><br>Anyway, yeah, sounds like a lot of fun to play with :) I may not reply very quickly tonight, but I&#39;m definitely interested.<br><br>~DF</p>

            <p>that Amy and Gurnirel will still be in RC1500 when Naergondir and Vania get there (seeing as they&#39;re on their way now)? Cos I&#39;d be totally up for that - I think that Naergondir finding his body could be very entertaining.<br><br>- Irish </p>

            <p>Well, if you haven&#39;t found it already Amy&#39;s info can be found <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Amelia_Renner">here</a>. Although you shouldn&#39;t need too much info about Amy - these aren&#39;t straight swaps, so Naergondir hasn&#39;t ended up Amy&#39;s body, he&#39;s ended up in Doc&#39;s (just to avoid any potential confusion). <br><br>My (and therefore Amy&#39;s) knowledge of LotR is almost strictly movieverse, plus a couple of random little titbits that I&#39;ve picked up from reading missions. <br><br>And while Naergondir&#39;s vocal cords may not be used to speaking English, Amy&#39;s mind is (and she doesn&#39;t know any Sindarin at all) so I&#39;m figuring Amy-as-Naergondir will be able to speak English just fine. <br><br>I was thinking that Amy would swap in while alone in a bedroom, and her frightened yelp on realising she was in someone else&#39;s body would attract the attention of whoever was nearby. How does that sound to you?<br><br>I&#39;m getting ready to make my first RP posts, but I&#39;ve got some other stuff to take care of first. If you want to start with Gurnirel then go ahead - Amy&#39;s reaction on being spoken to by a stranger would be to give a frightened squeak and then try to hide, so I don&#39;t mind you writing those reactions if you want to get this started.<br><br>- Irish </p>

            <p>And thanks for the link. My tired self is most grateful to get to skip the simple act of searching the wiki. /sigh/<br><br>Mostly movieverse, interesting. That should be helpful for Amy (or unhelpful/frustrating, depending on what, if anything, Gurnirel references).<br><br>Alright, then. Expect startled looks from Gurnirel when the English starts--and, more importantly, when it keeps going. And swapping alone in a bedroom should work; I don&#39;t see why they wouldn&#39;t have private sleeping areas. If they don&#39;t, I can always retcon it in a mission or interlude eventually (even to the point of saying that HQ once sprouted some extra rooms for all of two months). And I think we can assume that Naergondir&#39;s sleeping; I&#39;ll probably set Gurnirel&#39;s part of the scene in the same post as her reacting to Amy, so you can be the one to start.<br><br>Also, Amy&#39;s reaction?

            <p>... why he and every other agent in the PPC don&#39;t have implanted, impenetrable armour which can snap into place on a millisecond&#39;s notice, like they do in (among I am sure many other canons) the <i>Ancillary Justice/Sword/Mercy</i> trilogy. With replicator technology, it&#39;s trivially cheap to make, and improves survivability to, well, virtually 100%.

            <p>The PPC does not operate in a world of logic and sense, where the better equipped you are, the greater the odds of winning. They live in a world of Narrative, where tropes are more then observations, and what makes a good story trumps all else. Were agents to be armed to the teeth, wearing invulnerable armor, with weapons that could not break and overpower any armor, then the PPC would crumble in moments. Why? Because then Agents would be trying to be on a level playing field with Sues. And that will never happen. They bend the world to their whim. When faced with great adversaries, they always win, to make them seem more bad ass. Agents are no longer assassins, they are milestones.<br><br>So, how do we combat this? With Plot Armor, and underdog stories. The worse off it is for agents, the more endearing it is to the Narrative. The worse odds they have, the greater chance they stand. Of course, you can&#39;t walk in with absolutely nothing. That&#39;s not an underdog story, that&#39;s a suicide mission. So, we give Agents barely-working tech, that does still make their jobs much easier. We give them weapons, but only the most generic ones possible. And, best of all; we send those with wit. Agents might not be the most intelligent, or crafty, but they are all witty. They can bend Narrative in their favor, they can take advantage of their foes logical gaps to create their ultimate downfall. They can through the most painful puns. <br><br>In the end, a story of men facing gods and coming on top, is a much better narrative then unstoppable forces mowing down everything in their path. And that is not just meta commentary. It is in-universe law.</p>

            <p>So, Narav is a giant wolf-guy. He&#39;s extremely strong, and has a riiculous sense of smell - his species can sniff out bloodlines.

In terms of Bosh&#39;Guk&#39;s shared body, the main thing you&#39;ll need to figure out is who holds control of the body at any given point. Whoever has the stronger will usually wins out, although the other individual can yank control if needed for comedic effect.</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve been extremely busy with moving into a new house as well as classes. Anyway, Bosh&#39;Guk is an ogre magi from Warcraft - the grand majority of two-headed ogres are casters. Bosh is the one who has the know-how to use magic - while Guk has the capability, he doesn&#39;t quite have the mental fortitude or patience/interest to learn how to use it. I&#39;d say this extends to anyone in their shared body. While Bosh&#39;Guk has magical ability, you have to know how to use it in order to do anything at all. Otherwise, he&#39;s still an ogre, with all the strength that implies.</p>

            <p>BM- the characters on the list being Colt, Gerry, Denny and Rosedale- usually operates as a group out of their main RC, #20, but you can also go with them having been elsewhere at the time.<br><br>They also all carry radios for talking with other BM members by habit and Gerry in particular keeps a handgun holstered at her side.
