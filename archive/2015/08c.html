            <p>Welcome to another (super belated, whoops) round of Write the Genre! For the (pretty much everyone) who hadn’t been around for this before, WtG is a round robin game, focusing on agents Cris Wirewood and Myall Bromia, who reside in RC E#. There’s nothing suspicious about this, promise. However, they have something of a problem: The genre thingmabobby (properly called a  ‘genre and style regulator board’) for their response center’s console isn’t working properly so, it’s rather inclined to go haywire and change to random genres. Especially when agitated.<br><br>The previous mission can be found <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1o-HFM0bRdU-T0W1rdsvJbe4g7lK49f3nQgWB49CN3Hk/pub">here</a>, for those of you willing to read it, but the quick rules are thus:<br><br>1.You have to have Permission, or either have cowritten with someone who has Permission before. <br><br>2.After claiming the next turn, you have two hours to write it and then post. This is to prevent it from taking forever, and to give enough time to write a bit. If you don’t post in that time frame, someone else gets the opportunity to claim and write it.<br><br>3.You have to write said turn in accordance to the genre or even writing style given; the last one went everywhere from nature documentary to Dr. Seuss. <br><br>4.After finishing, don’t forget to include a genre for the next person to go with! Again, it can be pretty much anything! The sky’s the limit.<br><br><br>The mission(s) for this game is going to be <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8055828/1/Profesor-Lupus-and-the-Curse-of-the-Wearwolf"> Professor Lupus and the Curse of the Wearwolf</a> and its <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8736008/1/Profesor-Lupus-2-Fighting-Moudlermore">sequel</a>. <br><br><strong><br><br>“Cris. Cris-y.” Myall Bromia poked her dozing partner, who was currently slumped over their console. Saying her name while poking didn’t work. “Hey, hey.” A wicked look crossed her face and she grabbed the sword in scabbard at Cris’ side, before she said, in a reasonably on-point imitation: “<b>Hey!</b> Listen!” <br><br>Cris Wirewood straightened up in her chair, in a panic, trying to grab a sword that wasn’t there. “Navi, no!”<br><br>“You really have to stop falling asleep in here,” Myall said. “It’s just asking for trouble.”<br><br>“Like you?” She scowled. “And be careful with that, I know how clumsy you are.”<br><br>“Clumsy? <i>Moi</i>?” Myall gestured wildly. With the sword pommel in hand, like any reasonably not-so-sane agent. The scabbard flew off the sword, and hit the side of the console with a loud <b>THUNK</b>.<br><br></strong>_<br><br>The next genre is <i>Spy</i>.<br></p>

            <p>Myall and Cris followed McGonagall and Lupin to the common room for Ghosthand House (the <b>comoon rom</b> looked a bit like a giant CD made of silk), where they picked up Saruman and proceeded to the dungeons.<br><br>&quot;This needs to end soon,&quot; said Cris.  &quot;The minis don&#39;t step, and they&#39;re starting to get restless.&quot;<br><br>Behind the agents walked three mini-Balrogs.  sawsman accidentally stepped on Saurman&#39;s heel.<br><br>Saursman growled, &quot;Oh, wise guy?&quot; and stepped fully on sawsman&#39;s foot, leaving him hopping.<br><br>On the other side, Sarsman said, &quot;Leavum alone!&quot; and slapped the back of Saursman&#39;s head.<br><br>Saursman spun around and glared.  &quot;Whatsa big idea?&quot;  He poked the other demon in the eyes with two fingers.<br><br>sawsman laughed, &quot;Nyuck, nyuck, nyuck!&quot; and tried to hit Saursman on the head with the flat of his saw blade, but hit the slightly taller Sarsman instead.<br><br>&quot;Knucklehead!&quot;  Sarsman reared back his whip.<br><br>Myall rolled her eyes.  &quot;Ugh.  Enough!&quot;  She sent them back to OFUM.<br><br>The canons had gone to the dungeons to see if Voldemort had been hiding there, but had instead found a ghost that attacked them.  Considering how non-interactive Potterverse ghosts are, it probably shouldn&#39;t have been as much of an action scene as it was.<br><br>Eventually, Lupin expextro <b>did a expextro petrolium spell</b>, hitting the ghost in the face with a ghostly, glowing mini-Aragog, dripping with oil.<br><br>&quot;But it wasn&#39;t really a ghost!&quot; Cris announced.  It was really old man McTrollerson!&quot;  She unzipped the ghost outfit and let the troll out.<br><br>&quot;ohno net gain!&quot; it cried.<br><br>&quot;Here, let me clean that petroleum up!&quot;  Myall sprayed the troll with a blast of water from a giant seltzer bottle.<br><br>&quot;Some dinner with your drink?&quot; Cris asked before shoving a cream pie in the troll&#39;s face.<br><br>&quot;Wah&quot; cried the troll, who tried to stand up, but slipped on a banana peel.<br><br>&quot;We&#39;ll help you up!&quot; cried the agents.  They each took one hand and hauled the troll to its feet, zapping its hands with joy buzzers in the process.<br><br>&quot;Baawww&quot; whined the troll.  &quot;Dis somhew count as banisnmens!&quot;  It vanished.<br><br>((And tag back to July for the finale!))</p>

            <p>See, I mainly just know some HTML and whatever code the wiki uses, plus tiny things here and there that are good for other websites. I know enough to make things work and play around with things (broken URLs, various things in WordPress), stuff like that--but I&#39;ve never written a computer program, and have barely the idea of a clue of where to start. So it&#39;s less that this one scared me off as that I literally can&#39;t do it without first taking a course in computer programming or doing a *lot* of research.<br><br>So, uh, yeah. Some less specialized genres could be useful :) I&#39;ve definitely enjoyed reading what&#39;s been done so far, though.<br><br>~DF</p>

            <p>To describe how Cris and Myall felt as they forged on into the next chapter would be to describe one who is shaken beyond belief, terrified and terrorized by the trials and tribulations of both badfic and a changing genre. With the wind of the vaporized train at their backs and the replacements ahead of them, the agents found themselves in the strangest of place - one would describe it as a combination of a castle and a library, or perhaps a writing desk.<br>&quot;What is this place?&quot; asked Myall.<br>Cris checked the Words. &quot;Hogwrotes, I believe. I have a very bad feeling about this badfic, for there are as many mispellings in this passage alone as there are stars in the night sky.&quot;<br>At once, two more mini-Aragogs, namely Hogwrotes Sckoole, and McDongaol, and another mini-Balrog appeared, and as Bumbeldore declared that it was &quot;tim for a feast&quot;, yet another of the miniature spiders came crawling out of the darkness.<br>The agents sent the minis to their respective OFUs before they could notice, and just in time too. For the replacement, having spawned yet another mini-Aragog, declared that there were four new houses: Buffalochrage, a good house, Ghosthand hoyse, an evil house, and Parrotfaether house and Ratrunns house.<br>Not!Saruman stepped forward, and the Sorting Hat was lowered onto his head - &quot;Saroman you are to bein Gohsthand house!&quot; it declared.<br>&quot;but that is an evil house I don&#39;t want&quot;<br>&quot;hahahaha&quot; laufed sorter, as the agents shook their heads and exchanged shattered, broken glances.<br>&quot;The strange feeling, oh how it has returned,&quot; said Cris. &quot;We could be dealing with... with... a trollfic!&quot;<br>As yet two more mini-Acromantulas appeared, Not!Lupin and Not!McGonnagal were sorted into &quot;Buffalosharge house&quot;. The fic then spoke in a long sentence about the students going to bed, for want of a missing quote mark.<br>The chapter ended, with all the abruptness of a chapter being cut off. The agents just stood there, apalled, confused, and scared.<br><br>----------<br><br>Well, that was fun! The chapter to cover after this is Chapter 5. Next genre: Epic Poetry!</p>

            <p><b>Wish I hadn’t read that fic.  I keep making typos, now . . .</b><br><br>&gt; &gt; &gt; PLAY<br><br>“Hang on, Crissy!” The view of the camera’s video display suddenly went from darkness to colors, as the camera was swung up by the hand of whoever had recorded it.  “I want to get this on video.”<br><br>The person in the foreground—Crissy, apparently—slowly turned towards the camera with an irritated look.  “May I ask whatever for?”<br><br>“For posterity!  We’ll be able to look back when we’re older on the fond memories we forged—”<br><br>“In a trollfic?”<br><br>As the two humans bickered, the background slowly resolved into better focus.  Even then, it seemed incredibly unclear.  The location seemed to be made of some grey matter with random bricks stuck in the wall here and there.  There were torches high up on the walls, which gave off a dull red glow despite lacking any actual flame.  There were indistinct robed humanoids sitting at tables, watching the arguing humans, but—<br><br>The faces of a spider and fiery demon suddenly dominated the entire view screen, and the one watching flinched, nearly dropping the camera.<br><br>“Agh!  Don’t eat my camera!  Blasted minis!”  From the way the camera suddenly jerked, the holder seemed to have nudged the new creatures away.  “Just do it, Cris!”<br><br>“Fine.”  Cris turned her back to the camera and advanced on the seated people, waving a book over her head.  “We command this troll to leave this world!  The power of Rowling compels you!”<br><br>“Avaunt!” said the camera-person.  “No trolls in the dungeons today.  Or anywhere else on school grounds, for that matter!”<br><br>A dark, but strangely reflective, smoke began to settle over the room.  The camera began to turn rapidly back and forth.<br><br>“Ugh,” came Cris’s muffled voice.  “The troll essence was everywhere in this fic.”<br><br>“But where’s the troll?”  The camera suddenly stopped on a shadowy figure close by in the smoke.  “Uh.  Crissy?”<br><br>The figure lunged at the camera, and a big, green humanoid appeared briefly before the camera began shaking horribly.  The one holding the camera screamed.  Then, there was a crash, and color returned to the scene.  The camera’s image refocused as it accounted for the sudden sunlight.  The big green one rose above the camera and snarled.  Behind it, a gaping hole showed where the big thing had pushed the camera holder out through the wall of the now fully distinct building—a castle of some kind.<br><br>The troll raised its fists above it, but stopped when the camera-person said, “How does that feel?”<br><br>The troll gave a rather hilariously perplexed expression, then bellowed as said fists began smoking.  It tried to shield its head, but smoke began to appear all over its body.<br><br>“You are charged with trolling the <i>Harry Potter</i> universe and fandom, with giving Remus Lupin a nonsensical backstory, with kidnapping a villain out of <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>, with making enough typos to—Woops.  Guess that’s the end.”  The troll had completely dissolved into ash.<br><br>Cris appeared in the gaping hole.  “These guys are coming to, so let’s use Reparo on the wall and get going.  I already sent Saruman back home, though that might have been pointless if he’s in the sequel, too.”<br><br>The camera view jerked just slightly.  “Sequel?  This <i>thing</i> has a sequel?”<br><br>The human in view shrugged.  She pulled out a wooden stick and climbed out through the hole.  “Let’s just get it over with.  But first, Accio camcorder!”<br><br>The viewpoint suddenly and quickly flipped around, somehow being in Cris’s grip now, with the former holder, another human, laying on a buttress of the castle and covered in dust.  “Hey!” yelled the prone human, just before her face whizzed away, the camera showing a rotating view of castle walls alternating with the blue of the sky and the green of grass.  (And a final, distant audio recording of Cris saying, “That shouldn’t even work at Hogwarts, anyways.&quot;)  Then, the screen went black.<br><br>[<em>] STOP<br><br>The one viewing the video slowly let its arm drop to its side.  <i>What the hell did I just watch?</i> wondered Slender Man, still none the wiser as to why humans always seemed to be waving cameras around, and still short twenny dollas.  It dropped the camera under a tree and wandered away.<br><br>Had it stayed a little longer, it would have seen the video viewer suddenly start playing again.<br><br>&gt; &gt; &gt; PLAY<br><br>The camera lay on its side, grass on the left side, the edge of the castle at the bottom.  A breeze stirred the grass, and a bit of blackish ash was swirled up into the air . . . into the shape of a trollish face.<br><br>“Ill bee bach”<br><br>[</em>] STOP<br><br><b>The next writing prompt is: Manga/Anime style!<br>OR alternate super challenge prompt: math textbook style!</b><br>qwerty</p>

            <p>(Advance apologies to everyone who knows more about Japanese culture than I do.)<br><br>*Drums and flute sound, played by the A/V Division.  The usual kagami-ita backdrop shows only a generic grey wall, rather than a pine tree.  One figure in matching grey sits there, back hunched and facing the wall.   A second figure steps onto the stage, clad in a kimono mixed with Ancient Egyptian elements, and bearing a cat’s mask and a black fedora.*<br><br>“Greetings, travelers!  I am Bast, the Grey Lady, come to tell the tale (continue, really) of two samurai warriors poised to venture into the lands of the wizards’ school.”<br><br>*Chanting begins as two samurai in grey armor arrive on stage from either side.*<br><br>“These are the warriors, Cris and Myall!”<br><br>*Bast glances at Myall.*<br><br>“Who has been mysteriously genderbent, once again.”<br><br>*Myall is handed a more masculine-looking mask by a kuroko.  <s>S</s>he turns his face away from the audience to switch them.*<br><br>“I mean, seriously, girl.  Is it the name?  You can get a nickname.  Ahem!  These warriors of plot will now prepare for their journey.  Before they leave, they must seek protection for their mind!”<br><br>*Entering from the left side of the stage, one figure whose mask bears the facial hair of Doctor Freedenberg, another holding a fan painted with a riding crop—the symbol of Meir Brin.  They dance, waving their fans around the heads of the samurai, shaping barriers around them.  Before they leave, they each give one fan to one samurai.  They hold the fans before their faces, allowing the audience to read them for the first time.  Cris has received “COCOA” from Freedenberg; Myall has received “BLEEP” from Meir Brin.*<br><br>“They must gain protection for their bodies!”<br><br>*Entering from the right side of the stage, one figure with the helmet of Osbert, another figure dressed all in green, with a green mask, yeah, it’s the Jolly Greenman.  Deal with it.  They cross to the center of the stage, and enter into a mock battle with their fans.  Cris and Myall turn to watch raptly.  After the fighting dance is completed, they bow to each other, then to the samurai, awarding each a fan, which they display over their shoulders.  Cris has received “TRAIN” from Osbert; Myall has receieved “EQUIP” from the Greenman.*<br><br>“They must also gain the gift of stealth from the eyes of the unknown enemy!”<br><br>*The hunched figure stands and turns towards the audience.  This performer’s kimono is bedecked with fraying wires and loose buttons, and the mask is a reflective black glass.  It begins to move erratically, twisting about in a strange, formless dance.  The samurai approach cautiously.  As they get near, the Console leaps to the side, and pokes at Myall with a fan.  The samurai leap back, then try to approach the Console’s new position, only for the same  thing to happen to Cris.*<br><br>“Our warriors must gain disguises from the Console, but the machine is most fickle!”<br><br>*After many attempts to sneak up on the Console, the samurai begin to act more aggressively, brandishing the “TRAIN” and “EQUIP” fans at it, while the chanting lulls.  The Console relents, making pacifying gestures towards the samurai.  It then directs several kuroko to bring robes on stage and adorn the samurai with them.  The chanting begins again.  Myall gains the green and silver robes of Slytherin, and Cris gains the yellow and black robes of Hufflepuff.*<br><br>“Fully prepared, the samurai Cris and Myall are ready to venture into the lands of the wizard school.  The Console reveals the way!”<br><br>*Still twisting erratically as it moves, the Console steps to the kagani-ita and parts it down the middle.  Blue fog flows across the stage, and a great castle is visible through the mist.*<br><br>(I only capitalized the “c” in “console” because it’s a character in this context.  Don’t even start on me.<br><br>The next prompt is: tabletop role-playing game!  Have fun!)</p>

            <p>Welcome back to <i>Brain versus Fic</i>. Before the break, Cris was beginning to feel the pressure:<br><br>---<br><br><i>&quot;This is stupid.&quot; said Cris. <br><br>Cris was not nice. That was a Bad Thing.</i><br><br>---<br><br>While Myall was warming to her new body:<br><br>---<br><br><i>&quot;Well, hello,&quot; came a deep voice. It was attached to a very attractive smile.</i><br><br>---<br><br>But what happens when their progress on the Hogwarts Express gets halted?<br><br>---<br><br>[We cut to a green, slightly-faded night-vision camera. It&#39;s giving an extreme close-up of Cris&#39;s face, which ought to give everyone something to watch.]<br><br>&quot;Okay, so here&#39;s the thing. We were travelling on the Hogwarts Express - next carriage along with a glass pressed to the wall because <i>someone</i> can&#39;t cast a Supersensory Charm with a Muggle-Use Wand - but now we&#39;ve stopped. The not!McGonagall said something about an attack, but for all I know it might have been a conversation about the contents of her attic, God the SPaG in this place is atrocious. Wait. Hold up. Myall, do you hear that?&quot;<br><br>[Shakycam moving over to the door, where male!Myall is leaning out to look at something in the corridor. This should also give people something to look at.]<br><br>&quot;Myall? Myall, what&#39;s up?&quot;<br><br>[Myall turns around. Bumbeldore and Bumbelfore the mini-Aragogs are hanging from her sleeve.]<br><br>[MYALL, slightly pained] &quot;You, er, you wouldn&#39;t happen to have any bacon, would you? Or possibly a crowbar? No, that was someone else...&quot;<br><br>[Cris sighs and tugs the two minis off Myall&#39;s arm, portalling them efficiently to the HFA]<br><br>[MYALL, less pained] &quot;Thanks. I was trying to get a CAD reading on the Dumbledore replacement - must be getting a bit cramped in there, not that I&#39;d mind getting crammed next to Remus Lupin - but he&#39;s also sort of stuck in a tannoy system, which this thing doesn&#39;t have, and then he was outside fighting some weird OC called Mouldermort, who&#39;s Voldemort&#39;s father in defiance of both canon and sanity, and then I think spacetime went a bit... odd.&quot;<br><br>[CRIS] &quot;You&#39;re rambling a bit.&quot;<br><br>[MYALL, looking rather white.] &quot;Yeah, my CAD melted and, um, I don&#39;t think the fumes agree with me - oh, uh, uh-oh-&quot;<br><br>[We cut to a little while later, with a proper camera; Cris is trying to brush the sick off Myall&#39;s robes. A large fluffy boom mic is in shot, which the agents are doing their best to ignore.]<br><br>&quot;Are you feeling any better?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I think I ran out of lunch to make reappear, if that&#39;s what you mean.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Good.&quot; Cris rummaged in her bag. &quot;I&#39;ve still got my CAD, so we should be alright. Now, what did we pack for snacks? I&#39;m not going to trust the food in a fic like this, no matter whether or not it&#39;s Generic.&quot;<br><br>[A PACKAGE appears by plothole, courtesy of their console.]<br><br>&quot;What the...&quot; Myall poked the large box. &quot;Where in the name of sanity did that come from?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Australia, according to the tag on the outside. It says it&#39;s got lunch points for the Cafeteria in it - OH SWEET MONKEY CHRIST!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Shh! Shh! Don&#39;t alarm the Sues, the - oh. Oh, dear, turns out I had more lunch left in me after all. Welp, soon fix that!&quot;<br><br>[We cut to a close-up of the parcel&#39;s contents - a heapin&#39; helpin&#39; of witchetty grubs, bogong moths, and other sundry, wriggly, crawly delights]<br><br>---<br><br>Will the agents be able to earn enough lunch tokens from the Fictucker Trial? Will Agent Wirewood be made to drink her own urine for different reasons than normal this time? Find out after the break on <i>Brain versus Fic</i>.<br><br>---<br><br>Next genre: Video nasty!</p>

            <p>The video nasty... kinda sorta didn&#39;t exist. Think Grindhouse splatter movies crossed with Troma crossed with the mental outpourings of Dario Argento and the other great giallo directors.

Myall, where are you?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Well, hello,&quot; came a deep voice. It was attached to a very attractive smile, which in turn was attached to a tall-ish man class impeccably in a suit. &quot;The name&#39;s Bromia, Myall Bromia.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Oh, I&#39;ve heard of you,&quot; Cris said breathlessly.

            <p>1/ We don&#39;t really need to think about things we&#39;re not actually writing missions into. ^_^<br><br>2/ Canon-cloaking. The canon itself stops canon characters noticing us; there&#39;s no reason it shouldn&#39;t apply to omniscients.<br><br>3/ SEP fields. Unless your omniscient explicitly <i>pays attention to</i> everything (rather than just having the ability to know about it), an SEP field should render agents unnoticed.<br><br>4/ Canon self-repairs after a badfic is dealt with. Lots of characters don&#39;t need neuralysing at all; they just have the events wiped from their personal history. Dying characters will get back up and move on; uncanonically-alive characters will spontaneously die. You should really need <i>knowledge of alternate timelines</i> to get around this.<br><br>5/ Practical omniscience =/= true omniscience. Any method of omniscience that isn&#39;t simply They Just Know By Magic is spoofable by the PPC.<br><br>6/ &#39;And then dark gods tore a dimensional rift into HQ and slaughtered everyone inside&#39; isn&#39;t funny. The PPC is a humour series. Rule of Funny should be consulted over and above precedent and logic.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Before you read this, this is more of a rant then a call for change. I have been of this opinion for a while, and I really wanted to let it out. You may see it as unreasonable. It probably is unreasonable, but it is just one of those things that bugs me about how the PPC works. Don&#39;t read too much into it. Just, take it is me letting off some steam on this issue.<br>--------------<br><br>Look at all the ways Agents should never ever be seen, except by Sues. That&#39;s just dull, to me. Why bother hiding? Sues? They are so self-absorbed, they probably will ignore you until it&#39;s time to do the Duty anyway. You, and many others have stated that the PPC is not supposed to be about super OP gods stepping in to take out uber baddies and be super badass, but a bunch of barely trained agents faced against near impossible odds with barely-working tech. And yet, all agents get to be completely invisible, with no need to be careful or cautious. After all, it&#39;s just not anybody&#39;s problem, right? Waltz right into Elrond&#39;s home: nobody will mind! Which is funnier to you: agents having to hold in their extreme will to scream out, carefully slinking through the shadows, and trying to avoid explaining why, exactly, they are in the Princess&#39; private quarters without permission; or just popping a portal right in with no whims in the world.<br><br>There is no tension with this stuff, and comedy needs tension as much as drama. Moreso, at times. Especially when the sneaking fails, and the agents have to try to cover their tails.<br><br>And I get it, kill the bafic, canon is back. Yay. But that just makes the job easy too. Now they don&#39;t have  to clean up any mess left behind: just let the kill happen and the job is done. Never mind the potential lingering impact of such a being, never mind what little artifacts the Sue or the agents left behind. It all just washes away immediately so we can all ship off and go home. That aspect seems to have been fading from more modern missions, and I for one welcome this change. It may only be a couple paragraphs more, but it does help show how overworked these people are. They just got done killing this Ultra Sue. Yay! Now they have to go through and pick up every last hair she may have dropped, so she may never grow back like so much sparkly fungus. For the good of the canon.<br><br>That all said, I do understand why we have the thing of the canon cloaking you. But even then, it can only go so far, Jay and Acacia even mention how they have to disguise themselves as creatures that would reasonably kill Sues, so that the canon cloak won&#39;t fall apart. It helps, but it only helps them blend in as characters. The SEP fields make it way too easy. Way too simple. Great comedy can come from great danger answered with great silliness. This removes all of the danger, leaving only silliness.<br><br>Bah, but who am I? Some guy who came in late who has only released two missions. I can&#39;t tell people to ignore an aspect of the PPC that has been used for years, especially such a staple as this. All I can do is avoid use in my own work where I can, and still have it be recognizably PPC.</p>

            <p>And the Outer Gods, since they&#39;re actually different things. The vast majority of Lovecraftian horrors are not omniscient; they are more like unstoppable forces than sentient beings. They don&#39;t really get involved with humanity except to destroy them. The two major exceptions that I can think of would be Yog-Sothoth and Nyarlathotep.<br><br>Yog-Sothoth very explicitly knows and sees everything. He would definitely know about the PPC. That being said, he&#39;s not in a position to do anything about it due to being sealed outside of reality (although that didn&#39;t seem to stop him in &quot;The Dunwich Horror.&quot;)<br><br>Nyarlathotep, on the other hand, is not omniscient. He is, however, much more involved with humans. More specifically, he likes to drive them insane. He is treacherous, cruel, and yet profoundly charismatic. Nyarlathotep acts as the emissary of the Outer Gods, of which I believe Yog-Sothoth is part of. So… he could possibly know of the PPC. That could be a very bad thing.<br><br>PC, amateur Lovecraft scholar</p>

            <p>What about Nyarlathotep from the Persona universe (which granted, is based on the one aforementioned)? We are talking about the Glaurunging embodiment of collective evil of humanity here. That means it is omnipresent and as result of that and also being the manifestation of something related to the human mind, it is also omniscient. And it is also Glaurunging bent on screwing over and destroying humanity, only keeping enough around to perpetuate it is existence,  for as long humanity and thus evil exists, it can never be destroyed.  <br><br>For that matter, what about YHWH (which is SEVERELY different God from the one from Judeo-Christian tradition) and Lucifer from Shin Megami Tensei? Again, we are talking embodiments of eternal concepts here, in this case Order and Chaos. <br><br>YHWH wants to bring everything in existence under his lawful rule, so I can&#39;t imagine he would be pleased about the PPC. <br><br>Lucifer by the very definition of his job is a wild card, and may either not really care or be opposed due to seeing the PPC as being representive of Order and imposing on the freedom he embodies. </p>

            <p>And, indeed, could be shorter. (Jack Harkness? Why?) Usually, these are reserved to those who are truly Omnipotent. YAHWEH, Aslan, Death, and so on. Due to having complete omnipotence in their job description, it is a little difficult to make them say, &quot;except this.&quot; So, instead, we make a plea to their better nature and hope they wont go blabbing about us. They seem to have kept their word thus far.<br><br>However, I would make an argument about certain other canon characters who are not on the list. Relax, they are not fourth wall breakers. You can see how I think they go below. Indeed, I don&#39;t even go with the argument of, &quot;But they are gods, so they must know, because they are deities!&quot; Unless total and complete omnipotence is in their list of powers, they can be neuralized. Is it harder? Possibly. But it can, and will, be done.<br><br>In my view, the &quot;Recorders of Fate&quot; or &quot;Keepers of Forbidden Knowledge,&quot; may very well have some old tomes relating to the Protectors of the Plot Continuum. The biggest one is, for me, Hermaeus Mora: Daedric Prince of Forbidden Knowledge. He resides in the plane of Oblivion known as Apocrypha. Here, in the vast, unending library, resides all knowledge of all reality. whether mortal man or immortal god was meant to know any of it, it matters not, only that it be recorded within this maddening realm. To those who wish to seek it, grand power and inspiration lies within. But, be weary traveler, for within resides monstrous beasts and tormented souls who have lost their sanity and selves in the ever eternal quest for knowledge. But, beyond the physical dangers within the Eternal Library, be most afraid of that which you seek. For glancing within the wrong book without the proper mental wards can shatter even the strongest willed of minds.<br><br>In my view, Herma Mora is effectively Omnipotent. It is his job to know all things. Even better, with C0DA*, my view is true! In my C0DA, Hormaius Mora knows every dirty secret of the PPC, and how it all works. He knows how to find the Pool. He knows the exact layout of HQ. He even knows how Legal works. He will simply never tell anyone. He is far too interested in seeking new knowledge (of which, there is never ending, yet, non-existent) and impressionable, desperate minds to break and bend under his control. So, if ever an agent should see a pitch black book in HQ, it is best to send it directly to the Library, without ever glancing within. For your safety, and every one else&#39;s.<br><br>As for any other recorders of forbidden knowledge, you can make the argument that they have it within their library, somewhere. But what librarian is expected to have their entire stock memorized? Again, anyone other then Herma Mora.<br><br>(No, I have not misspelled Hermaeus Mora once in this post. He has a number of spellings. The proper one? Such knowledge mortal man is not meant to know.)<br><br>(*C0DA is something... special for the Elder Scrolls canon. While it does not stand for anything, I like to say it unofficially stands for: <b>Canon Open; Do Anything!</b> It is complicated, but I will gladly go into it if anyone is interested. However, yes, it also stands to reason that in your C0DA, Herma Mora knows nothing of the PPC, and have it be just as valid as my insistence that he knows everything. All I can do is try to convince you to adapt my C0DA as your own.)</p>

            <p>Because Mora is not all-powerful.<br>I think that, to know about the PPC, a canon needs to be either omniscient (so neuralysing can&#39;t undo their knowledge) or omnipotent (so they can stop themselves from being neuralysed; this requires said canon to encounter the PPC at least once).<br>Anyone else... well, if neuralysing doesn&#39;t work, FicPsych should be able to figure something out.</p>

            <p>That shows up in Lily&#39;s Blackout interlude and I think in some other places, such as Tasmin and Emma&#39;s missions--think about it. He sees through perception filters, yet never really asks who the agents are? He knows. I don&#39;t think he does much of anything with the information, but he&#39;s OOC resistant into the bargain (only to a certain point, mind you. And he can definitely be replaced). He seems to have at least a very basic knowledge of what agents do--he certainly knows they&#39;re there to help, and I think he might have been recognizing Tasmin and Emma eventually?--and, well, yeah. He knows at least a bit.<br><br>~DF, who can track down some links later if necessary.

            <p>As in, most likely do not know of the PPC simply because they haven&#39;t heard of them.

            <p>I&#39;m fairly sure that Bill Cipher from Gravity Falls knows about the PPC. Unfortunately he&#39;s probably the reason that I am leery of writing a mission in that universe - it seems like Agents would be too good a target to pass up, but I have no idea how that would play out other than &#39;badly.&#39;</p>

            <p>Let&#39;s use Captain Janeway as our example. She does not know of the actual PPC, and she can be neuralyzed. Howver, she has had enough contact with time travel, and other weird things that she may assume that a multiversal, order-keeping, paramilitary organization exists. Guess what the PPC is? So, she may assume that something like the PPC exists, without actually knowing about it. Contact with someone like this could go as follows:<br><br>(Secret) agent man: &quot;Hey, did you know we&#39;re in the PPC?&quot;<br><br>Random Redshirt: &quot;No, what&#39;s that?&quot;<br><br>Agent man: &quot;We go around the multiverse protecting canons and killing sues!&quot;<br><br>Random Redshirt: &quot;Oh yeah, professor Cromwell said something like that might exist, here are our first contact protocols for this situation.&quot;<br><br>This logic is really prevalent in the study of physics.

            <p>When it comes to fourth-wall breakers like Pinkie Pie (or the Looney Tunes, Deadpool, etc.), I tend to hold to an interpretation paraphrased from &quot;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5mU0HfI2jQ">Who Framed Roger Rabbit</a>?&quot;<br><br><i>&quot;No, I couldn&#39;t have realized what you were at any time.

            <p>Usually, the canon cloaks agents from canon characters, but not Mary Sues or other OCs. Or, in my interpretation, fourth wall breakers. Pinkie and the rest can see agents at any time: they just have no context for why they are there. Why do you think agents go in disguise? For the Sues and these people.<br><br>The exception to this rule is as you said: only when it is funny. If Pinkie has a good joke she can make about the PPC to agents, she will make it, but only have the vaguest idea about what she is actually talking about, quickly dismissed. Call it a &#39;hunch,&#39; if you will. Just one of a million million possibilities she just plucked out of the air on a whim, that just turned out to be correct.<br><br>Discord on the other hand is... Complicated. To be safe, we will just say, no. He has no idea. And yet, he knows everything. It just matters so little to him, he never recalls it, even under direct questioning. But, ask enough, and he could diverge PPC secrets if he wanted to. Or not. Whatever particular mood he is in at the time. Lovely thing about chaos. You can never predict it.</p>

            <p>Because keep in mind, she&#39;s literally a goddess, and her knowledge is therefore infinite in the same way as Aslan&#39;s is.

            <p>Aslan is on a different tier from, say, the Norse or Greek gods, who are more fallible.  Similarly, I doubt any of the Pathfinder deities would be aware of what goes on in the PPC, at least in part because we don&#39;t really fall under any of their domains, and they have bigger issues to deal with.  They wouldn&#39;t show up for the same reason they don&#39;t show up when you&#39;re fighting a dragon or demon in the game.  <br><br>And honestly, I think it&#39;s real-world implications that are what gives Aslan his edge over other deities.  I&#39;ve seen Death and Madoka be given a lot of respect in this reality as well.  Without getting into a debate about religion, I think real-world influence plays a part in whether or not they&#39;re aware of what we do, and I don&#39;t think it&#39;s entirely unfair.</p>

            <p>I mean, one of Pinkie&#39;s most defining traits (or at least fanon traits) is her Medium Awareness, so yeah, wouldn&#39;t surprise me if she realized that 1) She is not in a TV show anymore but in a fanfic and 2) that fanfic is currently being &quot;invaded&quot; by beings from other fictional universes.

            <p>Hi everyone! For those of you who don&#39;t know me, I&#39;m Dark Brother 16. For those of you who do know me, I have finally returned from the endless void (real life stuff) and I intend to stay this time. Of course, there will be intervals where I am off the Internet for a while, like we all are from time to time. I think I&#39;m going to renew my Claimed Badfics here soon, and I will attempt once again to gain Permission when I get a chance.<br><br>As an offering of renewed friendship, I am here to present something from the Pit, from whence I originally came. I have known about this Fic for a while, and have actually contributed to it a little bit.<br><br>Here&#39;s the link, and then a brief explanation.<br><br><a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7803566/1/Return-of-The-Brotherhood"><a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7803566/1/Return-of-The-Brotherhood">https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7803566/1/Return-of-The-Brotherhood</a></a><br><br>This story is a Suefic from The Elder Scrolls: Skyrim, and it follows Alyce as she attempts to rebuild the fractured Dark Brotherhood. The author of this Fic decided to accept submissions for characters for the whole story, with certain parameters and strings attached. As a result, many of these characters that are in here are Sues and Stus.<br><br>I will admit something. This story was one of the first that I followed and favorite while I was at the Pit. I was still in my early years of writing, and I genuinely liked this story. I even submitted a character named Nikita Contortus, my (biased) favorite character in the story. <br><br>Now, I am reluctant to submit this one, for the above reasons. However, the point of the PPC is not to insult or belittle the authors of stories, so I feel it will be okay. <br><br>However, I reserve the right to do this story myself. In fact, I am already making plans to make this story my Mission 1.<br><br>What are your thoughts? If by some chance I am breaking any rules (it&#39;s been a while since I was on here and I think I should read the Constitution again), please let me know.<br><br>~ Signed,<br>~ Dark Brother 16<br>~ Semper sint externa</p>

            <p>With the mission, I mean. You see, there is this C0DA thing in the Elder Scrolls. It gets rather complicated, but, to boil it down, there is no Canon, there is no fanon, all fanfictions are just as valid of interpretations of Mundus as the official Bethesda games. All of them. Let me explain further.<br><br>If you are familiar with the Elder Scrolls 3: Morrowind, then you are familiar with the work of one Michael Kirkblade. He is responsible for most of the Elder Scrolls&#39;... weirder aspects. There is a reason I say that Nirn is possibly more developed then the famous Arda. Kirkblade added several metaphysical aspects to his view of the land of Tamriel that shape its unique identity, such as CHIM, (basically the act of transcending and becoming a Buddah) and that all of known reality is a dream.<br><br>What does all that have to do with C0DA? Well, Kirkblade also introduced the concept of reincarnation. Not just of a person, but the whole world. Every time the world ends, for one reason or another, it will immediately be reborn, in a new form. Here, we have C0DA. Each person&#39;s individual idea as to how the world of the Elder Scrolls works is totally legit with C0DA. It is just one of many cycles, and cannot be dismissed. There are many reasons Kirkblade wanted to do this, partially because he likes open source fiction, partially because he does not like where Bethesda is going with the games and he wanted to stick it to them. <br><br>So what does this mean for the PPC? Well, in a way, it makes Elder Scrolls missions impossible. In a way, all fanfic is now canon. Or, well, at least, as Canon as Bethesda&#39;s version. Heck, even before this, the Elder Scrolls has been left purposefully open-ended. So much, they introduced Canon plot holes, in the form of Dragon Breaks. This was made in Daggerfall, so that all possible outcomes are Canon at the same time. All of them. It&#39;s called the Warp in the West. Major event in Tamriel&#39;s history. If you played Skyrim, you have a basic understanding of these Dragon Breaks.<br><br>However, if you are insistent, I can think of a few ways it could work. Your agents would have to work as Morag Tong, the assassins of Morrowind. They have legal contracts that allow them to kill in broad daylight. Well, in Morrowind, at least. In Skyrim, they would still be sneaky. However, it is a great excuse for a charge list. Just read the &quot;contract&quot; to the Sue when time to do the deed. Also, you would have to be very sparing in Canon charges. Unless it directly goes against everything that has ever been stated in every Elder Scrolls game, you may have to cut it a little slack. You are, however, allowed to point out how much this C0DA diverged from the commonly accepted one.<br><br>I am a bit of a lore nut. If you need help, I can see what I can do to see that your mission stays lore friendly.</p>

            <p>First off, missions don&#39;t necessarily have to be for canon-warping reasons. There&#39;s still the technical matters to think about.<br><br>Secondly, this C0DA thing sounds a bit iffy. What makes the work of Kirkblade — who from what I understand only worked on one <i>Elder Scrolls</i> game — more canonical than Bethesda&#39;s? What allows his strange and incomplete graphic novel override the work that all the other <i>Elder Scrolls</i> writers have done? Because people like his stuff? Because he&#39;s not affiliated with Bethesda (which I can understand people not liking)? That ultimately doesn&#39;t matter. The story — and thus canon — is dictated by those who write it.<br><br>The way you&#39;ve described it, C0DA just sounds like Kirkblade&#39;s own fanfiction. There is nothing to suggest that it carries any canonical weight. Much like the Fallout Bible, it is one possible interpretation of canonical events by an insider that can ultimately be overridden once the next game comes around.</p>

            <p>First is what I believe Kirkblade and WorldJumper are saying: that the fact that there are <i>many</i> quests with multiple endings, and therefore, each player has a different universe in Nirn - and every single one of those universes is canon. <br><br>However, there are fanfictions that go off the rails of <i>every single ending</i>, creating nonsensical variations that show up in no Elder Scrolls game ever, not could they. For example, in Skyrim, I&#39;m a big fan of Erandur pairings. There is no canonical evidence to support Erandur coupling off with anyone. Likewise, in Shivering Isles, what is the exact nature of the relationship (metaphysically, as well as interpersonally) between Sheogorath and Haskill? It&#39;s very much open to interpretation.<br><br>Good fanfiction <i>is still not canon</i>. A really great backstory about the sentient mudcrab in Morrowind is still not canon. A really great &quot;what happened after&quot; about the Companions in Whiterun <i>is still not canon</i>. I&#39;d love to write a story that ends the Civil War in Skyrim by putting the Forsworn in charge of everything, taking out the Stormcloaks and Thalmor alike. That&#39;s literally impossible as an actual ending to the Civil War - and so it <i>cannot be canon</i>. I&#39;d like to think it could be goodfic, but that doesn&#39;t make it canon.<br><br>Does that make sense? A fic that follows an OC along a quest perfectly in line with the canon ending may: A) disagree with the ending most players chose, making it non-canon for them; B) be a possible ending, making it canon for the game overall; C) still be a really bad fanfiction with a flat, boring character, bad spelling and syntax, and unrealistic dialogue.<br><br>Likewise, a fic that chooses a completely uncanonical quest ending might still have the characters at play be in-character and well-written, might adhere more to the spirit of the game, etc.</p>

            <p>Michael <u>Kirkbride</u>, although he was part of the design team for Redguard and Morrowind, and wrote some pieces of lore for the game Oblivion; he does <i><u>NOT</u></i> work anymore for Bethesda, the weight of his word for canon has as much weight for TES canon, as Frank Miller&#39;s has for the DCU.

            <p>I as typing most of this on my phone, which for one reason or another has Kirkblade in it. No idea why. So, that would be the reason for the misspellings.<br><br>Second, if you all want to ignore Kirkbride&#39;s musings over how things did not go the way he wanted it to, by all means, do so. However, I am not sure the rest of the world would agree with us. It is a very strong argument a writer could use against <i>any</i> mission we do in Elder Scrolls canon, and at the very least, we need to be ready for it. It is more then just fanon in almost everyone&#39;s eyes, and we need a good reason for why we are ignoring it. Or, we find a way to work around it.</p>

And for <i>Elder Scrolls</i>, that&#39;s the information stated in the games. Personal opinion doesn&#39;t account for anything. Canon is not some new invention intended to further a company&#39;s bottom line; it is part of story-telling, and has been for a long time. Plus, considering that the majority of PPC missions are only shared amongst this community, I&#39;m not overly concerned about agreeing with &quot;the rest of the world.&quot;</p>

            <p>I have been spending quite a bit of time with the sort of people who hold the open source fiction ideal high, and muse over how everything has changed for the worse since Morrowind and all that other nonsense. I have overestimated how important those people are. I do still hold that it is something that should be thought about, however, I can accept that C0DA does not hold that much weight. Well, at least, for now.<br><br>Even without that though, Elder Scrolls canon is still very open to interpretation. It is a challenging world to work in. I wish anyone who attempts it the best of luck.<br><br>(One small side note. What is strictly canon is not just what is directly in the games. <a href="http://www.imperial-library.info/">The Imperial Library</a> houses all of what is considered canon, such as in game books and dialogue. It also has some things that never made it directly in the games, but are still referenced or otherwise confirmed canon. There are also two books now! Which I have somehow not read yet. Anyway, that is just minor nitpicking, but something I thought I should mention.)<br></p>

            <p>And, while he is no longer technically employed by Bethesda, he is occasionally hired as a &quot;Lore Consonant.&quot; He no longer writes for the games directly, but does shape the greater world still. He <i>is</i> Elder Scrolls in many ways. A pretentious little twerp, yes, but he is near singlehandedly responsible for the more interesting aspects of Tamriel that separate it from your average fantasy setting. He is also responsible for one of the biggest Gary Stus in existence, (Vivec you prick) but I digress.<br><br>No, sadly, this is not just his own fanfic. Can Bethesda make it so? Of course they can (and I prey they do) but as it stands, it is more then that. He still works for the company (albeit as a freelancer rather then payroll) and he is a massive influence among the writers. While unconfirmed, it is said several writers who are still on payroll are in support of C0DA and it&#39;s ideas on canon. So, unless we want to draw the ire of the Elder Scrolls community, and directly ignore a potential massive aspect of how Bethesda treats canon, we have to careful in how we treat missions in the canon. Is it impossible? No. But it takes a lot more work then before.</p>

            <p>However, if I am, it is a very, very, <i>very</i> popular interpretation. Partially due to Kirkblade himself.<br><br><a href="http://c0da.es/t/c0da">Here</a> is C0DA itself. Read it if you wish. Just know that it is a script for a future graphic novel. And very, very confusing, even for a lore nut like me.<br><br><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/2reyef/what_is_c0da_an_answer/">Here </a> is the most accepted answer of what C0DA &quot;is&quot; by the TES lore community.<br><br>And now, a very choice quote from the author himself, speaking about canon on Reddit (which a massive part of C0DA was about):<br><br><i><b>What is your personal opinion on the idea of canon?</b><br><br>Tamriel never belonged to Bethesda. It was the other way around.<br><br>As for canon, it&#39;s really all interactive fiction, and that should mean something to everyone. That said, I appreciate and understand the stamp of &quot;official&quot;, but I think it will hurt more that it will help in the long run.<br><br>TES should be Open Source. It is for me.</i><br><br>So, there you have it. As far as we can understand, your C0DA is just as valid as the &#39;canon.&#39; There is a reason I am not fond of Kirkblade, but that is a rant for another day.</p>

            <p>There&#39;s this one guy who left Bethesda during the development of <i>Morrowind</i>, is still writing stuff for the community, and <i>he</i> thinks that every fan work is as valid an interpretation as Bethesda&#39;s work? That&#39;s what I&#39;m getting here. If I&#39;m mistaken, please correct me; but if that&#39;s the case, this guy is nothing more than a Big-Name Fan and we shouldn&#39;t go about deciding what&#39;s Canon or UnCanon according to what he says.

Doing 50% additional damage to enemies with any kind of status effect, major or minor, is good shtuff. Raichu, as a special sweeper, can take advantage of this - though be sure to use the ability Lightning Rod for the additional Special Attack boosts rather than going for Static. Raichu doesn&#39;t have the bulk for it. I&#39;d run Thunderbolt, Hidden Power Ice, Focus Blast, and either Teeter Dance if you&#39;re in singles - it&#39;s a really good way of spreading Confusion - or Thunder Wave if you aren&#39;t. Max out your Speed and Special Attack, with your last four EV Points in Special Defence, and select Timid as your nature, because high speed will really help you out and Raichu&#39;s base Speed is 110, which is pretty okay. However, you&#39;ll almost certainly need status spreader support if you want to get the most out of this item. =]</p>

            <p>So my computer decided to suddenly no longer work, and I&#39;m on a borrowed one for the time being, and in all that excitement plus a bunch of offline stuff the PPC ended up completely forgotten about (which is to say, I never quite got around to looking the Board back up). Hope people&#39;ve been doing well, and hopefully I&#39;ll have at least a few stories up and running soonish.<br><br>Now off to see what I&#39;ve missed, looks like some important stuff might have happened.</p>

            <p>I know for sure he didn&#39;t write <i>Dächer</i>; I don&#39;t think his typewriter had an umlaut key! It&#39;s possible I&#39;ve misremembered <i>Decken</i> as <i>Decker</i>, or it&#39;s possible he did; it was a long time ago, after all. (I&#39;m not at all surprised that an English course on German during the 40s got the wrong word for &#39;roof&#39;; that sounds about par for the course.)<br><br>The interesting question is whether I should fix the Decker&gt;Decken typo.

            <p>The story takes place in the Warriors series. None of the characters are canon, but the Clans are still there (forest territories, I think), as are the Clan traditions and customs and lingo and daily life and the belief in StarClan (and the Dark Forest, for those who know of it). I did my best to stick with canon for those, except for the main character who has a Suish name and a &quot;mysterious&quot; birthmark.</p>

            <p>... you&#39;re doing the mission on other grounds than canon-breaks, then?

            <p>How Sueish are they? How bit-character/generic are they? Can they be left to assimilate into canon, or are they too Sueish to manage it? That&#39;s the sort of question you want to be asking now. Bit characters and generics can probably just assimilate, maybe--they might become wild cats, though, since the clans are just about all named. Unless it&#39;s set earlier or later than the books, in which case let them assimilate if possible.<br><br>~DF</p>

No godmoding/power-playing. I control my characters and the eggs/hatchlings until Impression is made; you control your character(s) and your hatchling after Impression is made. (If you grant someone else permission to write your characters, though, that&#39;s fine.)<br><br>3. For ease of potential interluding, please write all posts in third person and past tense, and make sure to reply directly to the latest post in the thread so there&#39;s just one line of replies. (When the first line gets too long, we&#39;ll start a new one from the top.) Before you hit Post, you may want to check the Board in another tab/window to make sure no one has ninja&#39;d you.<br><br>4. This will not take place in real time, and in fact may go rather slowly due to me having a job and a life and only being able to respond so often. The rest of us have lives, too, and are scattered across time zones besides, so even if some of you happen to be online at the same time, do not allow yourselves to run away with the RP and leave the rest of us in the dust—especially me, at least until everyone has made Impression and I don&#39;t need to orchestrate anymore.<br><br>Thank you!<br><br><hr>
<br>Agent Voltarmi, Department of Intelligence, Liaison to the Keepers of Time in Azeroth, was a bronze dragon. She spent most of her time in the form of a pink-haired gnome to facilitate easier passage around Headquarters and easier interactions with her fellow agents, but in her downtime, she liked to relax in her natural shape. Therefore, her office was huge, hot, and full of sand. It was also decorated with posters of Dr. Manhattan and other buff, scantily clad blue men, but that&#39;s neither here nor there.<br><br>The tropical heat and recessed, sand-filled floor made the dragon&#39;s office the perfect place to incubate a clutch of fire-lizard eggs. Voltarmi hadn&#39;t made a bid for one of the eggs herself—possibly her ambivalence toward children extended to the prospect of having a very tiny cousin attached to her for life—but she had agreed to watch over them nevertheless. And being constantly aware of her entire timeline, she knew exactly when they were about to hatch and was able to put the word out in advance.<br><br>But not too far in advance. What fun would that be? She gave the current owners half an hour and everyone on the list of successful bidders between five and fifteen minutes, at random. Some of them would have to really scramble, and that would be good for a chuckle.<br><br>Of course, Jennifer Robinson was always going to really scramble, even if she&#39;d been given a full hour&#39;s warning. You didn&#39;t dawdle for eggs! And besides, she had more to do than anyone else. She had to gather up the handbooks she&#39;d prepared for the new owners, and she had to collect her son from the Nursery and the all-important meat from the Cafeteria. She wanted her hatchlings—she thought of them as hers even though this was in no way true—to have the best first meal possible, so she&#39;d spent a lot of her off-duty time in the past week hunting Pern&#39;s uninhabited south for wild wherries. (With help, of course. Giving Suicide an excuse to exercise his throwing arm not only resulted in better hunting than she could have managed on her own, but also stroked his masculine ego and led to some additional rather fun demonstrations thereof.) She convinced the Cafeteria cooks to butcher and store them for her by bringing them enough extra to serve as a dinner special, but she had to cart the resulting twelve bowls of raw meat and giblets from the kitchens to Voltarmi&#39;s office herself, with a six-year-old riding on her back.<br><br>Henry was going to watch. He was too young to have a fire-lizard himself, but since Jenni was raising him on Pernese songs and stories, it would have been unfair to keep him from witnessing a real, live hatching. He would sit on Voltarmi&#39;s desk, next to the bronze dragon in her gnome form, and they would both have a pretty good view.<br><br>Once he was settled and chatting happily to Ilraen about his day, Jenni checked the eggs, arranged in a loose double-circle on a mound of sand in an out of the way corner of the office. Their mottled shells were rock-hard, and she could just about feel them throbbing with life ready to break free. But there was a little time yet. Time enough for Nume to pick one to take to his boss—the smallest, she noticed—and time enough for her to give the agents a few last-minute reminders about what to do. Assuming they got here soon . . . .<br><br><hr>
<br>(( For the record, <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/User_blog:Neshomeh/An_Agent's_Guide_to_Fire-Lizards">Jenni&#39;s guidebook may be found here</a> for the convenience of those who may not be too familiar with Pern and its littlest dragonkin. It&#39;s incomplete as of this post, but I&#39;ll keep working on it until it&#39;s finished. Most of what&#39;s not there will probably be covered in-character in this RP anyway. {= )<br><br>(( If you&#39;re some of the first to reply, your agents probably got one of Voltarmi&#39;s earlier messages. Lucky them. If it takes you a while, blame the capricious time dragon, but don&#39;t worry about it. Your egg won&#39;t hatch without you, I promise! ))</p>

            <p>It was a fair assessment to say that -- while possessed of good character, an inquiring mind, and a kindly, gentle disposition -- the 7th Earl of Wymbourne was not one of nature&#39;s sailors. His father had been a Navy man (that much backstory had been granted him by his unfortunately Suvian wife) but his brother had been the seaman; indeed, Algie had devoted his life and personal fortune to magic largely because, in his own estimation, he became violently seasick on anything wetter than a dewy lawn. However, here he was, afloat with naught but a heavily-armed former XCOM field officer for company, feeling thoroughly sorry for himself as he rued his luncheon, long since disappeared over the side in a technicolour yawn of which Linda Blair would have been proud.<br><br>&quot;Ah, cheer up, your Lordship, you&#39;ll be fine.&quot; Nothing could dampen Field Commander Lola McCandless&#39; enthusiasm, not even the flood. She was one of those people who would trot out the old phrase that the Chinese word for &quot;crisis&quot; was the same as that for opportunity were it not for the fact that she was troubled by the occasional presence of a thought in her head. &quot;At least we were allowed to crack the Arc Throwers out, makes the job ten times easier.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Commander, you forget your augments. Not all of us are blessed with the ability to turn off our sense of smell, though there are a few tinctures related in Meredyth&#39;s <i>Whisperings Of The Great</i><sup>1</sup> that might have worked had not this devilsome flood demolished mine and Agamemnon&#39;s laboratory.&quot; Algie brushed at his DIA-issue oilskin with his free hand. If he concentrated on practical magic to the exclusion of all else, he could almost but not entirely distance himself from the reek of Arc Thrower-belaboured kraken. The stench was reminiscent of calamari, if the chef&#39;s only tools had been a poorly-earthed piece of electrical equipment and prayer.<br><br>&quot;Eh, like I said, we&#39;re <i>fine</i>. Look at you! Holding up nicely. I bet one day soon you&#39;ll be able to go on a real boat!&quot;<br><br>Algie, who had been raised properly, gave her the least weak smile he could presently summon up. &quot;Thank you for your confidence in me, Commander. I fear it is misplaced, but your sentiment is much appreciated, depend upon it.&quot;<br><br>Lola had worked with him for a couple of months now, and knew better than to startle him with a matey clap on the shoulder. Instead, she just smiled and continued to pilot their large tin bathtub, the longer-established DIA mob having previously laid claim to all the dinghies. Quite where Algie&#39;d managed to dredge it up from, she didn&#39;t care to ask, possibly because she was scared he&#39;d literally dredged it up from somewhere, but she was as determined as ever to make the best of things.<br><br>They continued their merry way down a corridor, Algie leafing through his e-books and muttering to himself in a dead language. Behind them, the floodwater started to flow backwards, gently pushing them along rather than leaving them marooned in a pile of enormous, concussed squids.<br><br>As they rounded a corner, Lola stopped moving and crouched down, unlocking the safety catch of her Arc Thrower. &quot;There&#39;s something coming up at the T-junction ahead. It&#39;s moving fast, and it&#39;s moving against the current. Game face on, Algie.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Just as you say, Commander.&quot; Algie concentrated, then leaned over the side and filled up a makeshift scrying bowl with water. It might have been a Generic Mug with an inscription that said <i>To The Worlds Greatest Insert Relative Here</i>, but one made do with what one had to hand. He drew a quick cross-shape in the water and held a hand over it. &quot;I have the beast. It has taken a left at the junction and... means to go right. I must say, this thing seems rather fast on its feet, assuming it even possesses them. Given what you&#39;ve been catching so far, it may not.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Great,&quot; Lola said as she steered them around the bend. &quot;Fast-moving tentacle things I can&#39;t track with the good ol&#39; Mark One Eyeball. At least it can&#39;t fly. It, it can&#39;t fly, can it? It can&#39;t fly.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I see nothing to indicate it can,&quot; Algie replied. Admittedly, he had seen very little full stop, and nothing of their quarry&#39;s physical anatomy aside from the odd glimpse of a fin, but Lola&#39;s free hand was rubbing at her neck so he decided not to say so. &quot;We will both be right as ninepence, Commander. We are here to look out for each other, are we not?&quot;<br><br>&quot;... Yes. Yes, we are.&quot; Lola stuffed her hand into the pocket of her own oilskin with rather more force than was necessary. &quot;We are. Ignore me, I&#39;m being stupid.&quot;<br><br>&quot;You never are,&quot; he replied, and reached out his hand to touch her other hand, far away from her neck. He looked back down at the mug and stopped dead, his hand gripping a little too tight.<br><br>&quot;What? Algie, what - it&#39;s coming back, isn&#39;t it?&quot;<br><br>&quot;At pace! Brace for imp-&quot;<br><br>Algie was cut off by an enormous <b><i>CLANGGGG</i></b> of something on bathtub. Said something rocketed out of the water in a dizzying, brightly-coloured spray, and the waves tipped both agents out of the tub and into the drink.<br><br>Lola was the first to surface. &quot;What the <i>hell</i> was that? And what&#39;s this crap in my hair?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Glubble,&quot; Algie glubbled eloquently as he began to sink. &quot;Glubble glubrblblblbl.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Algie!&quot; Lola swam over and hauled him back to the surface, his periwig having floated off somewhere else. &quot;Algie, are you okay?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I will be...&quot; he wheezed. &quot;In all likelihood.&quot;<br><br>The whatever-it-was landed back in the water with a splash and leapt out again, and Algie was only able to shake his vision clear for a moment before his partner reacted, shoving him out of the way as lurid orange goo coated the water where he had previously been.<br><br>&quot;Thank you, Commander.&quot;<br><br>&quot;It&#39;s in my <i>hair</i> I was <i>growing it out</i> this thing <i>fries</i> - oh. Damn.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Language,&quot; Algie reflexively chided.<br><br>&quot;Yeah, well, not everyone can pronounce an asterisk. Also, we have bigger problems.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I fail to see what they are. We are floating, yes, but your Arc Thrower is to hand and our assailant has momentarily vanished.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Algie? It&#39;s XCOM tech. This stuff really doesn&#39;t like seawater.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Seawater.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yep.&quot;<br><br>&quot;<i>Seawater</i>.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I know, right? Something to do with the salts, I think, I wasn&#39;t really paying attention at the time. I&#39;d been shot, it tends to dominate your thinking a bit.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Indeed. That seems...&quot; Algie paused, biting back a tirade. &quot;That seems like a considerable oversight.&quot;<br><br>The creature had apparently taken the opportunity to circle around and come back at them, and with a cry of challenge it leapt onto the upturned tub, transforming on the way there.<br><br>As it clanked down hard, wielding what looked like an elaborate Super Soaker, Lola&#39;s eyes went a little bit wide.<br><br>&quot;She&#39;s an <i>Inkling</i>! Oh my God look at you you&#39;re so <i>precious</i>!&quot;<br><br>The Inkling gave a little curtsey and shot her in the face with the goop.<br><br>&quot;You are rapidly becoming less precious.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Well, you&#39;re the guppy who&#39;s not shooting <i>back</i>. Honestly. Don&#39;t you know how this game works?&quot;<br><br>&quot;... Were you in a match?&quot;<br><br>Splat.<br><br>&quot;<i>Duh</i>, of course I was in a match! What else would I be doing, guppy? I went squid, dived through a grate, went through the big hole, and out here. Is this a secret area or something?&quot;<br><br>&quot;You, er, you could say that, yes.&quot; Algie decided to speak up, now that he was treading water and able to at least vaguely breathe. &quot;My name is Algernon, 7th Earl Wymbourne, and I work for an organization called the PPC. Please don&#39;t shoot me in the-&quot;<br><br>Splat.<br><br>&quot;I should perhaps have seen that coming,&quot; he continued. &quot;Still, I should probably mention-&quot;<br><br>Splatsplatsplatsplatsplat.<br><br>&quot;... If I could just get a word in? Please?&quot; Algie threw his head under the water the moment the Inkling&#39;s trigger finger moved. Then he came back up. &quot;You didn&#39;t fire.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Duh, &#39;cause you ducked! God, you guys are so <i>bad</i> at this.&quot;<br><br>&quot;We&#39;re humans. We&#39;re not exactly known for feats of aquabatic prowess, especially not by the standards of... your doubtless fine people.&quot;<br><br>&quot;What&#39;s a human?&quot;<br><br>&quot;We&#39;re like your kid mode,&quot; Lola piped up, &quot;only without the turning-into-a-squid bit.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Ohhhh... have you tried pressing-&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yeah, no, that doesn&#39;t work on us, cob.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Huh.&quot;<br><br>&quot;You got a name, kiddo?&quot;<br><br>&quot;xXxFartMeisterxXx. What&#39;s yours?&quot;<br><br>&quot;... Got any nicknames?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Kay.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Right. Cool. Kay, um, you&#39;re more than a bit lost right now. This is, well, it&#39;s not Inkopolis. Not even close. You&#39;re in the Headquarters of the Protectors of the Plot Continuum, and, um, I think you must have got wrapped up in our little flooding problem.&quot;<br><br>Kay blinked and staggered back a little, nearly falling out of the bathtub. &quot;You guppies consider this a problem? It&#39;s <i>amazing</i>! There&#39;s so much cool stuff just floating around, and I&#39;m not even running out of ink! I love it here!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Well, if you&#39;d like to stay-&quot;<br><br>&quot;Where do I sign!&quot; Kay bounced on her feet, the bathtub making slightly ominous noises.<br><br>&quot;Let&#39;s figure that out later. Right now? I want to towel off. And shower. And towel off. And shower again.&quot;<br><br>&quot;What are we going to do about the krakens?&quot; Algie said.<br><br>&quot;Let that Guardsman guy you&#39;re always banging on about deal with it. We&#39;ve done enough, you&#39;ve earned a rest, and Kay needs orientation&quot;<br><br>And so, as the three paddled off, life began anew for the little Inkling that could. She grabbed Algie and Lola and pulled them into a tight hug. &quot;You guys and me? We&#39;re gonna be best buds. Go team!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Glrbl,&quot; replied Algie, who was just not suited for a life on the ocean wave.<br><br>---<br><br><sup>1</sup>: This is a real book; indeed, I own it. However, it is not a book of magic, or even about it, but rather a collection of quotations from the great and the good. I felt its title was well-suited for a treatise on Revivalist English Magic, though perhaps (given friend Algie&#39;s origins) one of somewhat dubious canonicity.<br><br>Algie, Lola, and Kay belong to me. <i>Jonathan Strange and Mister Norrell</i> belongs to Susanna Clarke. <i>XCOM: Enemy Unknown</i> belongs to Firaxis and, further up the line, Julian Gollop. <i>Splatoon</i> belongs to Nintendo. I belong to my bed. I am going to go to sleep. I hope this has amused people by the time I wake up.</p>

            <p>(( Because it&#39;s about time to wrap back up to here anyway.<br><br>(( A few notes: 1. I&#39;m gonna crack eggs in batches, and I have the day off today, so if you happen to be around I can actually engage in a little back-and-forth posting with you while feeding hatchlings is going on. Yay! Just not too quickly, if for no other reason than that I have to do laundry and stuff today, too.<br><br>(( 2. A thing I forgot to say - the meat is cut up into tiny blobs about the size of your first thumb joint. This is important. I am the dumb for not saying so IC from the get go.<br><br>(( 3. &quot;Think loving thoughts&quot; means be loving at the hatchling. If your character was confused IC, that&#39;s cool, they&#39;ll figure it out pretty quick. I just want to make sure no one is confused OOC.<br><br>(( And now, ladies and gentlemen, your main event! ))<br><br>Jenni did not, in fact, approve of the Notary one little bit. She took her eyes off that egg for one second to survey the room, and when she looked back, there was that woman, on her feet and juggling egg and meat in her hands like a ninny—and what was that, a skewer? She was going to feed it with a <i>pointy object?</i> Jenni pressed her hands to her face and groaned. The woman was going to kill that poor hatchling for sure. But if she could ignore Brightbeard&#39;s kindhearted words and the clown jumping up and down next to her, she certainly wasn&#39;t going to listen to Jenni. If she lost it, maybe it would be a lesson to her. In her mind, Jenni washed her hands of the matter and resolved to help the other ten owners succeed no matter what.<br><br>Just about everyone else had done the sensible thing and sat down on the sand with their egg in front of them or in their lap. That was good—a few had the food a little too close to the eggs, though, which wouldn&#39;t help them Impress. One last chance to impart some wisdom.<br><br>&quot;Okay, everyone!&quot; she called out. &quot;Make sure to settle your eggs so your hatchling can break out safely, and don&#39;t let them gorge on the meat. Feed them carefully, one piece at a time, and make sure they eat from your hand, not the bowl!&quot;<br><br>She heard Hera and Ilwion&#39;s song reach a new level of intensity, and the first three eggs broke almost simultaneously.<br><br>If anyone&#39;s was first, though, it was Colt&#39;s. The egg gave one good hard rock, tipped on its side, and shattered. A little green head popped out. The hatchling gave a startled, raucous call, her eyes glinting red like tiny rubies, and shook off the rest of her shell, leaving herself flopping awkwardly on her side with one wing snared beneath her. She called again, a piteous little creel of hunger and dismay.<br><br>Near Colt, Gerry&#39;s hatchling had a considerably better time of it. The shell broke neatly, and the creature that staggered forth, though dark with egg fluid, was clearly bronze. He lay on the sand a moment, catching his breath, then flapped his wings and got to his feet, looking around and urgently calling for food.<br><br>At the same time, Alex Dives&#39; egg hatched, and this one was a blue who, when dry, would be the exact medium gray-blue shade favored by the Harper Hall. He added his cries to those of his siblings, head swinging wildly one way, then the other. He caught the scent of the bowl in Alex&#39;s lap, and with an excited squawk, lurched toward the tech.<br><br>&quot;Remember, small bites!&quot; Jenni called out. Her heart raced. She could feel the hatchlings&#39; hunger—anyone with more natural sensitivity than a block of wood could feel it—and she remembered her own Impressions, lifetimes ago though they were. Tears pricked her eyes, but she wouldn&#39;t let herself get caught up in memory.<br><br>Henry helped with that. He had been happily chatting with the Illion-Sims kids about this and that, and he eagerly scooted toward the agents with their eggs when he heard the humming that he knew signaled the start of the hatching. He was startled by sudden pangs of appetite, though. &quot;Mommy?&quot; he called out uncertainly. &quot;Mommy? I&#39;m really hungry!&quot;<br><br>His tone brought her to his side in an instant, and she scooped him up into her arms. &quot;It&#39;s all right, baby. It&#39;s not you, it&#39;s the hatchlings. Remember?&quot; She smoothed his fine black hair back from his face and also threw a light shield over his mind. The tracker on her ankle vibrated a warning, but she ignored it. The hunger would only get more intense when more eggs cracked, and she couldn&#39;t have her own child upset.<br><br>&quot;Oh yeah,&quot; Henry said, relaxing against her. Then he spotted Gerry&#39;s and pointed excitedly. &quot;Look, look! That one&#39;s a bronze like Ilwion! That&#39;s good, right?&quot;<br><br>Jenni laughed. &quot;They&#39;re all good, Henry. Just watch now, and see what they do!&quot;<br><br><hr>
<br>(( I&#39;m deliberately starting with a couple players who are familiar with Pern and know how this works, so watch, and see what they do! ^_~ ))</p>

            <p>With each suddenly holding a bowl of meat and an egg with its hatchling ready to escape, both shoved onto them (though fortunately having things shoved into their arms was a common occurance, in BM), Colt, and then Gerry, settled down onto  the sand as well. <br><br>The half-elf didn&#39;t so much so much as sprawl against the edge of the sand as lean against it on his side, egg nestled nearby, and the bowl of meat ready at hand. <br><br>Gerry had lowered herself down, folding down into sitting Indian style, egg right in front of her, with a small bit of meat already pinched between her fingers, all her attention and concentration focused on the egg. <br><br>Colt&#39;s egg was the very first one to hatch, the green keening for food. His eyes widened- both at surprise at the sudden hunger he felt himself, and her appearance- and softened, as he grabbed a small piece and offered it to the green, his other hand reaching to get her unsnared and unflopped with gentle fingers.  His thoughts weren&#39;t just of love, but of companionship, friendship, being welcomed. All this he was directing at the green, things he wanted the tiny hatchling to feel. The group he had found here in the PPC wasn&#39;t just who he worked with, they were also family. <br><br>And then Gerry&#39;s hatchling broke from his own shell, getting a cry of delight from the woman. &quot;I have food right here for you, bossywings,&quot; she said as much as thought, sounding pleased and proud, squashing the feelings of hunger that had bubbled up, nudging the bit already in her fingers towards him. For this, for the hatchling, she wouldn&#39;t trade anything in the world.</p>

            <p>The little bronze was quick to spot the morsel Gerry offered him. With a triumphant cry, he darted forward and snatched the piece from her fingers, not even bothering to chew as he bolted it down. Fortunately, the raw, slippery wherry-meat went down easily. He sniffed, searching for more, and warbled his need to his new benefactor.<br><br>The green, meanwhile, flapped and flopped in her own attempts to right herself while taking the food offered her at the same time. In the wild, she would have been in trouble, but here, thanks to Colt&#39;s efforts, she got her wing unfouled and found her feet in the end. She hopped eagerly toward Colt, peering up at him with utmost admiration for his assistance. But she was really very, very hungry, and made this known with a series of shrill cheeps.<br><br><hr>

            <p>The little blue preemptively dubbed Zeke was not interested in words. He was very, very interested in the meat Alex held in his other hand, toward which he turned and pounced. He tried to propel himself with his still-damp wings and overbalanced when the tip of one struck the sand. He screeched in frustration at being kept from his meal.<br><br>Four more eggs cracked.<br><br>The two belonging to Alleb and Shui-Hua were greens. The tapping Alleb felt soon turned into determined rocking, and unless she put it down in a hurry, she would have a handful of egg goo and a flailing green fire-lizard with sharp little claws scrabbling for purchase on her palms.<br><br>Shui-Hua&#39;s egg, being safely on the sand, hatched with no trouble. This one was a bright mint green, like a beryl. After her initial startled screech upon suddenly freeing herself from her shell, she caught scent of the nearby bowl and started for it.<br><br>Brightbeard&#39;s egg seemed to rock to the rhythm of his humming. It thrummed to a low note and finally cracked, spilling its albumin and a rich, dark mocha-brown hatchling. His fiery eyes whirled as he got to his feet, and he gave a little bugle and shook his wings.<br><br>Jenni was watching as Bosh&#39;Guk&#39;s hatchling, or just Guk&#39;s, as it happened, made its appearance. She was concerned about this one, though she wasn&#39;t planning to intervene unless the little fire-lizard showed signs of distress. Everything looked fine for now, though. The hatchling was a dark blue, and he quickly got up and began stalking around the remains of his shell, creeling with hunger.</p>

            <p>The eggs little tap escalated to rocking.

You will be as dear to me as the Sentinel to his King, and I&#39;ll never let anything harm you. We&#39;ll be together till the end of time, you and I. My little fire-lizard.</i>&quot;<br><br>Alleb smiled fondly at the swaying egg; and then the cracking started. <br><br>((I didn&#39;t want to carry the hatching any further, even though you already revealed its color.

            <p>Everything began moving very quickly. The asari soon found herself sitting on the sand with a bowl of meat (which had caused her to blush at her own forgetfulness when she received it from Ilraen) and a shaking egg arranged in front of her. This was it. Literally the penultimate moment.<br><br>Teyala clasped her hands in her lap, closed her eyes, and bent her thoughts towards the creature in the egg. This fire-lizard was to be part of her family now, and would be so for a long time. The concept was at the same time overwhelming and wonderful. She pushed those feelings of joy and love to the forefront of her mind, and began to wait.<br><br>((I meant to post to this earlier, but I got distracted by a combination of the other RP and my not feeling well at the moment.

            <p>As the brown made its presence known to the world, Brightbeard brought the meat close to it.  He could feel the hunger, but he was old and used to ignoring the urges of the body.  &quot;I&#39;ve some food for ye, lad.  And more where that came from.&quot;  He tried radiating feelings of home and love.  The warmth of the hearth, the forge, and the Light.<br><br>The brown eyed its meal for a moment before pouncing.  It grabbed the meat out of Brightbeard&#39;s calloused fingers and greedily gulped it down.  This one was strong, clearly.<br><br>Brightbeard continued to feed the hatchling, and tried to think of a name.  He had no frame of reference for a brown dragon.  Blue, green, and bronze dragons could be found on Azeroth, but brown was unheard of.  So, where to gain inspiration?  Fire Lizards were the progenitor race for Pernese dragons, so perhaps the proto-dragons of Northrend could offer a start.<br><br>And then it hit him.  &quot;Galakrond,&quot; he said to himself, barely above a whisper.  &quot;The father of dragons.  A stong name for a strong hatchling.&quot;</p>

            <p>(( Finally. Stupid YourWebApps, crashing when I needed to post...<br><br>(( Disclaimer: I am le tired, and cannot go take a nap before firing ze missiles. Advance apologies for any dumb mistakes, oversights, etc. ))<br><br>Alleb&#39;s green burst from her shell with a squeal and shook her wings to dislodge a fragment that clung to her. Once unencumbered, she began sniffing for food, mewling in her tiny voice so that her hunger was known both audibly and psychically.<br><br>Zeke, meanwhile, attempted to swallow as much as Alex would give him at once, crying any time the supply seemed to dry up. His tiny belly soon began to bulge with the meal, though, and his movements became slower and clumsier. In addition to getting full, he was getting tired. Hatching was hard work!<br><br>As the others fed their hatchlings, the last four eggs rocked harder and began to crack.<br><br>Teyala&#39;s was the fourth green, the color of pine needles. She spilled herself abruptly onto the warm sand and, after a moment&#39;s rest, struck out straight toward the asari, shrilling her hunger.<br><br>Des&#39; egg was on the larger side of medium, and when it cracked open, it divulged a sturdy little brown who would dry to an eye-pleasing dark amber shade. He quickly realized he was penned in by Des&#39; crossed legs and screeched a complaint, then set about scaling the nearest ankle with his little needle-sharp claws.<br><br>Next to him, Dawn&#39;s egg, which had made a strong start but little progress so far, finally picked up the pace again. The original crack widened, splintered, and finally bifurcated the shell entirely. The creature that scrambled out from between the halves was bright gold, her wingsails nearly transparent as she spread them to dry. Then she was on her feet, calling loudly and urgently. She&#39;d had a hard fight to get free of her shell, and she was ravenous.<br><br>The last egg to hatch, because the Laws of Narrative Drama demanded it, was the Notary&#39;s. With a final heave, the shell shattered, its liquid contents soaking into her robe. A little blue, his hide a pale periwinkle, shook himself free.<br><br>&quot;Lola&quot; was a male. Apparently the Laws of Narrative Irony hadn&#39;t wanted to be left out.<br><br>He tottered about, creeling, until he snagged a claw on the fabric. His cries turned agitated, and he flapped to free himself so he could continue his urgent quest to fill his stomach. He was still too wet to fly as yet, so he didn&#39;t succeed in doing much except creating a small breeze, but at least he was distracted from lunging at the roasting skewer and potentially impaling or burning himself. So far, so good.<br><br><hr>
<br>OOC notes!<br><br>1. Pern RPers tend to leave the gold&#39;s hatching for last for maximum excitement, but I hope we can all agree that&#39;s not the most interesting story here. {= ) I gave it to Dawn for three reasons: 1) DawnFire knows Pern, so she&#39;ll know what to do with her; 2) she&#39;s active and likely to do stuff with this character and fire-lizard; and 3) Agent Dawn is in a relationship with Agent Des, which leads me to:<br><br>2. I&#39;ve given Des a nice big brown because I quite simply find a brown-gold pairing more interesting than the usual bronze-gold. Plus, this way, their clutches won&#39;t tend to have more golds in them, which will keep HQ&#39;s fire-lizard population nice and manageable. [And while I&#39;m sure they&#39;d prefer mates other than their siblings, such a mating won&#39;t hurt their offspring, at least not in the first generation. Dragon-kind has more robust genetics than human-kind.]<br><br>3. I planned for the Notary&#39;s fire-lizard to be a blue since we talked about colors back in the ICEP trade thread. More than the color, though, I went with this because blues are the least dominant members of a fire-lizard fair, so they&#39;re sort of used to being pushed around by everybody else. I figured that would give the Notary the best possible chance of a successful bond. I didn&#39;t do it to screw with her, I promise.<br><br>4. I like the name Zeke! I didn&#39;t mean to criticize; I&#39;m just slightly baffled by the notion of naming anything before you meet it, that&#39;s all. {= )<br><br>5. If anybody&#39;s wondering, the Lichen got a green, as per the numbers I set out back in the ICEP thread. Some of you might&#39;ve caught the hint about Nume picking out the smallest egg, too.<br><br>Also, questions!<br><br>1. What language is &quot;Feysuei,&quot; and what does it mean? It doesn&#39;t seem to be Chinese... and if it were, I&#39;d think it would be &quot;Fei,&quot; not &quot;Fey.&quot;<br><br>2. I assume &quot;Khataltelet&quot; is Hebrew? That&#39;s a big name for a little fire-lizard! What does it mean?<br><br>~Neshomeh is the curious.</p>

            <p>Des smiled when his egg finally hatched. He took a piece of meat and handed it to his fire-lizard, who gulped it down and continued to scale Des&#39; leg.

            <p>The Notary rummaged through a pocket with her offhand and came out with a pair of long evening gloves, one of which she struggled to put on. Once the task had been completed, she resisted the urge to chow down on the wherry-meat herself and instead plucked a piece off the end of the skewer, gently laying it out on the palm of her and ignoring the fat that hissed and spat at her cheek. &quot;Here, little Lola. Be a good... lifeform and eat your space chicken.&quot;<br><br>Lola, or possibly Lolus, sniffed curiously at the still-hot meat, golden brown and tender and <i>probably</i> not radioactive. Then, getting the hint, it took an inquisitive nibble -- before wolfing down the rest like a dragon possessed.<br><br>&quot;Good flying blue gecko thing,&quot; mumbled the Notary, who hadn&#39;t been paying very much attention and wasn&#39;t really sure what happened next. &quot;Good Lola. Would you like some more?&quot;<br><br>An emphatic creel courtesy of Lola.<br><br>&quot;Then you shall have it,&quot; the Notary replied, laying down more of the browned-off meat before the dragonet. &quot;Human, do you perhaps have some wet wipes about your person? Lola is still slick with amniotic fluids and I neglected to bring a handkerchief. While your species compatriot&#39;s guide was useful, it neglected to mention that these things were quite so... <i>sticky</i>.&quot;<br><br>Wobbles bounded over, a packet of baby wipes in hand. &quot;Huh. You can&#39;t touch your dergn, &#39;cause of something you can&#39;t be at fault for,&quot; she said as she dabbed the egg goop off of Lola&#39;s back. &quot;Wonder what that&#39;s like.

The Assassin reached blindly for a piece of wherry meat, and then nearly ate it herself before remembering that a, she was vegetarian, and b, it was uncooked and meant for the hatchling. She redirected her hand, offering the meat on her fingertips to the eager little gold, and reaching for more once that had been scarfed down.<br><br>A <i>gold</i>, she thought again. <i>What</i>.<br><br>Well, that settled it. The world had gone mad, she had the shiniest, prettiest hatchling of them all, and she <i>really</i> wanted a sandwich, unless that was just the hatchling&#39;s influence.<br><br>And what on Earth was she supposed to name the creature? She had vaguely considered Lehavonet, a Hebrew version of &#39;little flame&#39;, but that would never do for such a brilliant hatchling as this one. She had never expected a gold; she had thought up the name more with a green in mind, though she had tried her best not to go in with expectations and had reminded herself that she shouldn&#39;t get attached to a name before meeting her newest little friend.

If you don&#39;t, I&#39;m sure you will soon.&quot; She reached for more meat and held it out. &quot;I don&#39;t have a name waiting for you, but I promise I&#39;ll find one.

            <p>Alleb saw a bright flash of green as the little dragon emerged from it&#39;s shell. It shook itself, then began to mewl, nosing around for food on the sandy floor. Alleb felt the hatchling&#39;s intense hunger, and grabbed a chunk of meat from the bowl. She did it barehanded; the slop of Alleble&#39;s dragons was much, much worse. <br><br>Willing her hand not to bring the meat to her own mouth, Alleb extended it to the hatchling. The little thing ate like a ravenous wolvin, and Alleb reached for another piece. &quot;Hello, little one,&quot; she cooed. &quot;My, you&#39;re as green as the eyes of a Mitheguardian Glimpse before Sir Aidan&#39;s adventure!&quot; She gave her another bit of meat, then gently rubbed the top of the hatchling&#39;s head with her finger. It was sticky, which Alleb really should have been able to guess. After another piece of meat, she plucked a cleaning rag, meant for her sword (which she had unbuckled and laid beside her) and began wiping her down. <br><br>&quot;What shall I call you?&quot; Alleb said to her new friend. &quot;Lily, maybe? No. Perhaps if you were a White of Yewland...&quot; Alleb thought for a moment, then snapped her fingers. &quot;I know! Mithe!&quot; She grinned at the tiny dragon. Mithe. <br><br>((I know that fire-lizards are definitely not dragons, but that&#39;s what they look like to Agent Alleb, so I thought it would make sense in-narrative.))<br><br>((Fire-lizard!

            <p>(( Let&#39;s take this as an opportunity to reset and behave from here on out, yeah? ))<br><br>&lt;Hello, Agent Brightbeard,&gt; Ilraen replied happily, although he offered his delicate seven-fingered hand with hesitation. He hoped the Dwarf was aware that he had to reserve his strength. &lt;My partner and I are well enough, thank you.&gt;<br><br>He would have gone on, but he noticed the blue asari approaching them at that point.<br><br>She walked over to the Andalite and gave him a courteous nod. &quot;Hello Ilraen,&quot; she said. &quot;I hope you&#39;re doing well.&quot;<br><br>&lt;Yes, thank you, Teyala. Henry and I are very excited to be present for this occasion. We wish you joy with the outcome—and you as well.&gt; He bowed slightly toward Brightbeard. &lt;Now, since our transactions are not material in nature, please do not let me keep you from your eggs. Jenni tells me it will be best to be comfortably settled before the shells begin to crack, which should be quite soon.&gt; He glanced at Voltarmi, who nodded with the cheeky grin of someone who knows and isn&#39;t telling.<br><br>...<br><br>Henry yelped when Bella abruptly hugged him. &quot;Bell-<i>la</i>!&quot; he complained, struggling to free his arms so he could pry her off. &quot;Lemme go! No glomping, no glomping!&quot; An ill-timed heave resulted in one of his feet slipping out from under him in the sand, and the two children went over in a heap. &quot;<i>Mo-om!</i>&quot;<br><br>...<br><br>No sooner had Jenni finished speaking than a blur of gold streaked by her to land with the clutch beside her. &quot;Well, hello, gorgeous!&quot; she exclaimed softly. Quickly gathering in her excitement, she did her best to radiate calm and confidence as the queen inspected her eggs. &quot;Don&#39;t worry, they&#39;re all right.&quot;<br><br>And then Dafydd was back, issuing much the same sentiment. She nodded at his reassurance, but was distracted from replying by the young tech—another Intern Alex, she recalled—coming around to get vetted by Hera. The queen&#39;s acceptance of Alex reassured Jenni that she wasn&#39;t likely to interfere with the Impressions.<br><br>Then Henry squalled for her, and her head whipped around to pinpoint where he&#39;d tumbled in the sand. She relaxed, realizing that everything was all right—he was just in a tussle with little Belladonna. She trusted Constance to sort it out, so she simply called out, &quot;You&#39;re fine, Henry! Play nice!&quot; and left it at that.<br><br>She was surprised to note that, although the dwarf and asari had made their way to Ilraen and the Cafeteria dolly, no one else had queued for their eggs yet. If Hera was any indication, they&#39;d better hurry up. She planted her hands on her hips and looked around impatiently. She did not want a chaotic last-minute scramble, and she especially did not want to be landed with ten fire-lizards. She was not Menolly, thank you very much!<br><br>She raised her hands and clapped loudly for attention. She was peripherally aware of upsetting Hera and Ilwion with the sudden noise, but they&#39;d be more upset if their hatchlings started to arrive with nothing but each other close enough to eat. &quot;Come on, people! Do you want an egg, or not? We have <i>minutes</i>, if that! Let&#39;s have some order, please!&quot;</p>

We ran into some issues navigating HQ.&quot;<br><br>The ogre placed the sack on the ground, loosening the top and pulling out vials of various colors as well as a few sealed scrolls.<br><br>&quot;I don&#39;t believe we were able to specify what constituted an acceptable trade, so I&#39;ve brought a general variety of things,&quot; Bosh started, bending to pick up a red vial. &quot;This is a basic healing potion.

            <p>((A preemptive apology for mistakes; I&#39;m currently on my phone, and it doesn&#39;t like playing by grammar and spelling rules.))<br><br>Agent Alleb, knight of Alleble, servant of King Eliam, was really bad at chess.<br><br>&quot;Checkmate,&quot; said her partner, Jesse McKines, for the fourth time. He grinned as he knocked over Alleb&#39;s last line of defense, a pawn, and set his queen squarely in front of her king. <br><br>Just then, the console went <i>Bip!</i> Alleb frowned at the strange device. It took some getting used to: having such a wealth of information at her fingertips. Even the Great Library of Alleble, accessible only to the King and His Sentinel, didn&#39;t seem so large when compared to the great Interwebz. <br><br>Alleb stood and walked over to the screen, slowly hitting the buttons that would take her to the &quot;inbox.&quot; She read the message slowly, and then her eyes widened. &quot;Great moonrascals!&quot; she yelped, running for the door. &quot;They are hatching in moments! I&#39;m late!&quot; <br><br>Jesse called something after her, but she didn&#39;t catch it. <br><br>To distract herself, Alleb began reciting all that she knew of the Olde Language, and pretended she was merely on an errand for Sir Oswyn, and would be home soon. After a few minutes, she skidded to a halt in front of the proper RC, took a moment to catch her breath, and walked through the open door. To her surprise, there was already quite a crowd of agents, including several odd-looking characters and... children? Furthermore, the floor was sand, but compared to the nature of HQ&#39;s halls this didn&#39;t seem so unusual. The eggs were there, and smaller than Alleb had imagined.<br><br>Alleb suddenly heard a woman (Nurse Jennifer, perchance?) call everyone to order. Alleb hesitantly stepped forward and tapped the Nurse on the shoulder. &quot;I am in the correct place, am I not?&quot; she asked.<br><br>((For anyone who would like to respond to any of my posts: Alleb is not human. She is a Glimpse; therefore, her skin is ghostly white (I can&#39;t stress that enough. It&#39;s nearly translucent and almost glows) and her eyes flash blue when she turns her head. Feel free to have them do so whenever you wish.))<br><br>((Also, this is my first RP, so if I do something wrong please tell me.))<br><br>-Alleb</p>

            <p>&quot;I am here under false pretenses.&quot;<br><br>There was silence at that, if only from Wobbles, and if only then in a manner preeded by an immensely sarcastic gasp. The Notary paid it no mind. She was rather used to it. &quot;I am here under false pretenses,&quot; she repeated, &quot;because I know that I seek a fire-lizard partner, and would not be in receipt of such friendship if it were left to the discretion of other agents. I am not without reputation.&quot;<br><br>Throughout this, she had been edging towards the dragonet, her arms folded. They unfolded, presenting a smallish staser. &quot;I&#39;m a bureaucrat. I ran blockades, once upon a time, but that was a long time ago. I lived and loved and had high adventures... but that was long ago as well. I refuse to let it colour my decision-making process any more than it already has. I wish only to let the following be known.<br><br>&quot;I have a staser. There are many like it, but this one is mine. It kills the things that I consider worth killing. It is good at that. And I am deeply, deeply scared of it. It is eternal death in the form of a pipe and box. And I will never, as long as I draw breath, use for anything other than the defence of your child, should you deem me worthy of such an honour.<br><br>&quot;I am a liar and a cheat and a hateful misanthropic b*tch,&quot; she continued, pronouncing the asterisk with some difficulty. &quot;I am the worst person in this room. But I believe in redemption. I believe in salvation. And I would very, very much like to believe in myself.<br><br>&quot;I think I need you for that, though.&quot;<br><br>She awaited the consent of the queen to take an egg, leaving herself on bended knee, wondering (on a very deep level) if the fire-lizard was going to buy it, or was even smart enough to do so.</p>

            <p>Jenni watched Brightbeard get his egg with amusement at the formality he showed toward the little gold. Well, she supposed it didn&#39;t do any harm to set an example of respect toward dragonkind . . .<br><br>Or so she thought.<br><br>She assured a ghostly girl that yes, if she was here for the fire-lizard hatching, this was the right place.

Such grandiose words for a fire-lizard! She looked down at the top of the kneeling woman&#39;s head, struggling with a confusion of skepticism and pity. On the one hand, what was she trying to pull? But on the other, her tone and manner suggested complete sincerity, and Jenni rather thought she would know if the act were a sham.<br><br>She crouched down to be on an eye-level with the Time Lady. &quot;Um,&quot; she said as quietly as possible, hoping to keep it between them, &quot;sorry, but it&#39;s not actually up to her. She didn&#39;t make the deal. She&#39;s also,&quot; and here Jenni lowered her voice for greater intensity, &quot;not the one who will hunt you down if you&#39;re faking your good intentions.&quot; She drove the point home with a deep green stare.<br><br>And abruptly broke it off when she noticed a drop of dark orange-tinted blood fall to the sand. She backtraced it to the Notary&#39;s lacerated knuckles and clicked her tongue in professional disapproval. &quot;Now, how&#39;d you do <i>that?</i> And here&#39;s me without my kit! Tell you what—the dwarf over there is a paladin, I&#39;m sure he can fix you up right quick. <i>Then</i> you can try to co-opt the egg meant for your partner if you insist.&quot;<br><br><hr>
<br>(( Sneaking in a night post because I just couldn&#39;t let anyone respond to the Notary before me. *g* I&#39;ll catch up with the folks talking to Ilraen tomorrow.<br><br>Gloss 1: Jenni is a sucker for redemption stories. The Notary really, really should&#39;ve just talked to her. Alas, she was not to know.<br><br>Gloss 2: Jenni is a healer first, everything else second. QED.

He simply didn&#39;t care; his concern was all for Hera.<br><br>When her mate&#39;s touch had done its work, Hera craned her neck to look across the room at Constance. Her friend had spent a very long time explaining that the eggs were being given to others, and were no longer her responsibility, and despite her insistence on using words to mask her emotions, the message had gotten through. Hera didn&#39;t <i>like</i> it, but she knew that her children&#39;s fate had passed out of her reach.<br><br>So she did what she was best at: she ignored the issue entirely. She settled down, her head between her forelegs, and never looked at the supplicant again.<br><br>~<br><br>((hS))</p>

            <p>Just as she started to walk away, she saw a woman kneel before a gold fire-lizard that Alleb hadn&#39;t noticed before. She missed most of the woman&#39;s speech as she stared at the creature; it was exactly as described in the pamphlet, and for that she was grateful. <br><br>Alleb left when Nurse Jennifer started talking; it seemed indecent to stay any longer. She walked slowly and surveyed the room until she found Master Fothergill. He was standing on the opposite side of the room, facing someone. They appeared to be in conversation, although Alleb had read that Master Fothergill didn&#39;t exactly communicate in the same way that she did. <br><br>Fingering the handle of her soon-to-be-traded dagger, Alleb walked over slowly, and positioned herself so that the... andalite, wasn&#39;t it? could see her, but the woman he was talking to could not. She had to admit, the agent made her rather nervous. He was so... alien. Alleb had caught a few glimpses of humans in Alleble, and they had seemed extraordinarily strange to her. But Master Fothergill made them seem as tame as a woozle.<br><br>Alleb shifted her weight to one foot, tapping the pommel of her sword, <i>Cer Fel,</i> and waited. </p>

            <p>Dawn had looked up and gone ‘meep!’ around the point when Dafydd had informed them that fire-lizards were telempaths, but had relaxed a little around his comment about everyone’s names. She had even been going to reply, before the fire-lizards had reclaimed his attention; but that was fine, because it gave her time to think.<br><br>Dafydd. That really rang a bell, but not enough to be useful. DOGA agent, right, and rather famous (or was it infamous?) and there had been something about a Ring of Power…or perhaps a Silmaril of Power? No, that couldn’t be right. And why <i>was</i> he missing a hand? Maybe he really had been given Maedhros’ backstory...<br><br>Someone — Nurse Jenni, wasn’t it? — clapped her hands loudly, distracting the Assassin from her thoughts. “Come on, people! Do you want an egg, or not? We have <i>minutes</i>, if that! Let&#39;s have some order, please!”<br><br>“Honoured to meet you, Dafydd,” Des said. “I’ve read a report or couple of yours. I’m… impressed, suffice to say.” He glanced at Jenni. “If you will excuse us?”<br><br>Eggs. Those were very, very important.<br><br>“Come on,” Dawn said. She pulled Des away, waving nervously at the Elf as they went. “The fire-lizards await!”<br><br>“Oh, isn’t this exciting?” Des said, smiling.<br><br>Dawn grinned. She was jumping around excitedly more than she was walking by this point. “<i>So</i> exciting. Can you believe it? We&#39;re going to have <i>fire-lizards</i>!”<br><br>“Yesyes!” Des chirped. “Let’s go give Ilraen — wow, seein’ an Andalite up close! — the stuff, shall we?” He directed Dawn to the Detangler, digging the uncanonical lightsaber out of his pocket en route. “Hey, Ilraen!” he half-said, half-shouted. “What’s up? Here’s the promised stuff!”<br></p>

The man was holding an odd metal tube. Alleb gave them a hesitant smile and waved. &quot;<i>I wonder what he means when he says &#39;what&#39;s up&#39;?&quot;</i> she thought, glancing skyward.

They could conclude the specifics of their business later.<br><br>She walked over towards the nest and watched as the dwarf gave his respects to Hera, followed closely by the rather sour-looking woman with the grandiose speech.

            <p>Ilraen nodded in farewell to Brightbeard and Teyala as they departed. Teyala forgot to pick up a bowl of wherry-meat, and he almost called out to remind her, but there was a line forming in front of him. Well, Jenni would make sure everyone was prepared.<br><br>He turned his attention to Shui-Hua and was surprised, both at being addressed with a botched attempt at his third name and by the amount of stuff laid at his hooves. Thirty pounds? That couldn&#39;t be used in a normal forge, at that? He&#39;d planned on working something out with Brightbeard, which would satisfy their trade, but now he wasn&#39;t sure. Could the dwarf work with this stuff?<br><br>He put his consternation aside to respond to the technician. &lt;&#39;Agent Ilraen&#39; is fine, and of course I will look after the tea,&gt; he assured her. &lt;It will remain safely in the box until I can give it to her.&gt; He made no comment on Agent Des and the alleged teapot theft. What did he know about it? &lt;Thank you for your consideration. Now, please take a bowl of meat and approach Jenni for your egg.&gt;<br><br>Once she had gone, Ilraen found himself unusually pressed to use both his main eyes and a stalk-eye to properly face one being. He had never met anyone with two heads before and found himself quite fascinated. Unfortunately, Bosh seemed a bit put off by the three-eyed regard and stammered his way through a description of his trade until Guk called him up.<br><br>&lt;It is quite all right,&gt; Ilraen assured them, raising one hand placatingly. &lt;My partner can use them, and when I am in human disguise, I <i>do</i> have a mouth. Besides, I can drink them through my hooves in my natural form.&gt; He raised one cloven forehoof as if in demonstration. &lt;Do not worry, this trade is very good. Please take a bowl of meat and go to Jenni for your egg—and good luck!&gt;<br><br>Next, an almost frighteningly pale-skinned girl with glowing eyes approached him. Perhaps she would have been reassured to know that he found her just as strange as she found him, but before he could say anything, he heard Agent Des call out to him. He was not caught out by the idiom, as he would have been years ago, and he waved back.<br><br>&lt;Hello, Agents Desdendelle and McKenna! You may leave everything with me. Thank you very much, and do not forget to take a bowl of meat each before you collect your eggs!&gt;<br><br>As they left their trades, his stalk-eyes roamed around the room, taking note of who was there and who he&#39;d spoken to so far, then addressed the wraith-like girl. &lt;You must be Agent Alleb. Is that correct?&gt;<br><br><hr>
<br>(( Okay... I think I&#39;m caught up. Please forgive me if I&#39;ve missed anyone, and also for having Ilraen hurry people along. I&#39;m pretty sure you&#39;d all rather get to the main event as quickly as possible, too. {= D<br><br>Oh, and btw, Edhelistar, I&#39;m assuming that by &quot;a bag of tea&quot; you mean a decent-sized pouch, containing 2-3 oz or so, rather than a single individual-serving teabag. I know Iroh&#39;s tea is a big deal and very valuable to connoisseurs, but that would be very disappointing! ))</p>

            <p>Des flipped the lightsaber around so the emitter wasn’t facing Ilraen and handed it to the Andalite. “I don’t need to tell you to handle with care, I reckon?” he said with a tilt of his head.<br><br>Dawn, meanwhile, unlooped the scarf and folded it with a sigh of relief before extracting the medical scanner and a small bottle of Retcon tablets from her pockets. “The dosage instructions are on the bit of paper I slipped inside,” she informed Ilraen when it was her turn to hand things over. “For the Retcon, I mean. The scanner seems pretty self-explanatory, and I think there’re things you can get from the Canon Library or DoSAT that’ll help with doing complex things with it. And I hope the scarf’s alright — I thought blue and green would work, but you can always exchange it for a different one if you don’t like it, that’s not a problem.”<br><br>Once Ilraen had taken the things, they each took a bowl of meat and went to Jenni to take their eggs. “This is so exciting!” Des said with a wide smile.<br><br>Dawn grinned, holding her bowl just a little farther away from her than was strictly necessary. “<i>Fire-lizards</i>,” was all she said — and then she said it again, with an even bigger grin.</p>

            <p>This was because she would be fine.<br><br>A little digging through files that purported to be confidential, and probably were to someone who didn&#39;t live in the filing system to the extent that she did, had led to Nurse Robinson being bumped up the rankings of the Notary&#39;s personal list of potential threats (in reality an elaborate web that looked like nothing so much as abstract art). She had the ability to lean on stuff, to just <i>make stuff</i> go how she wanted it to. And the Notary had a theory about how that worked.<br><br>See, the multiverse was not a place that cared about single sentient beings. The Notary described it as like expecting a stage set to write a review of the play performed on it. So the multiverse at large actually <i>obeying</i> the various, occasionally self-contradictory whims of your average sentient-being-about-town was quite out of the question, though by the Notary&#39;s standards calling any human sentient was a bit of a stretch. This led to some interesting theories, but the Notary&#39;s pet theory (and therefore the one she&#39;d defend to the hilt in the face of absolutely overwhelming evidence) involved that old chestnut, the parallel universe.<br><br>Now, Gallifrey had closed off travel to parallel universes during the Time War, but by the same token, there existed an infinite number of universes where they hadn&#39;t. Transfinite set mathematics was a wonderful thing, if one was totally averse to going outside, and thus the Notary had browsed through some of the more pop-sci treatises on the subject in her time off to better understand this theory and how it applied to multiversal theory. It seemed logical to her that Nurse Jenni&#39;s powers resided on her flicking through universes like a file on a Rolodex and transporting, possibly subconsciously, possibly not, to the universe where her desired outcome happened. And since there&#39;s no such thing as impossible, only the deeply weird, it was highly likely that, as a for-instance, the chains holding a canon prisoner in a dungeon could spontaneously decay to nothingness without so much as a fast-time field setup.<br><br>By the same token, the Notary therefore felt she had no reason at all to fear the nurse&#39;s threats of direst retribution, because <i>it would all be happening to a different her and <b>she</b> would therefore be fine</i>.<br><br>This probably said a lot more about her than she&#39;d care to admit.<br><br>So, brushing off the front of her robes, she stood (rising to her full height like a wizard&#39;s scarecrow) and levelled her gaze at Jenni. &quot;Nurse Robinson, Time Lords can communicate telepathically via a haptic connection. Pernese fire lizards are themselves telepathic. All I must do is touch the hatchling and it will know if it wants to be around me or not, and after that, you may conduct whatever hideously protracted program of vengeful torment you see fit. I am surprised you didn&#39;t know this about my people, come to think of it. Perhaps you would appreciate a handbook?&quot;<br><br>And with that and a noise like a camping holiday in a wind tunnel, the Notary turned and swept imperiously away.<br><br>That she tripped on something hidden in the sand and smashed face-first into the glowing crotch of a Doctor Manhattan poster <i>in no way invalidated her theory</i>.</p>

            <p>(( All more or less the same, until... ))<br><br>Jenni stood and started toward the Notary, intending to help steady her and take the opportunity to put a few more instructive words in her ear, but apparently she wasn&#39;t the only one with that idea.<br><br>Brightbeard had heard the Notary&#39;s speech to Hera and felt the sincerity of the words. When the Notary tripped, he was the first to her side. A quick gesture to Jenni let her know that her services were not needed at this time.<br><br>The Dwarf knelt down in the sand next to the Notary.  &quot;I&#39;m sorry. I understand that ye&#39;ve got a reputation, and that people can be a long time in forgivin&#39;, and even longer in forgettin&#39;. That said, I dinna put much stock in idle gossip. What I do put stock into is people who want tae be better than they were yesterday. I believe in redemption and salvation, but most importantly I believe in ye. I believe ye want those things and I believe ye can achieve them.&quot;<br><br>&quot;First step is maybe letting someone help ye to yer feet.&quot;  With that, Brightbeard held out his hand.  &quot;And maybe I can look at those cuts?&quot;<br><br>Jenni, brought up short by the Dwarf&#39;s intervention, stood frustrated for a moment. She <i>had</i> to explain the situation to this woman lest she put a hatchling, or worse, all the hatchlings in danger, but—<br><br>Wait. What was that?<br><br>She turned back toward the nest, heart in her throat. Sure enough, Hera and Ilwion had sat up on their haunches, eyes whirling rapidly, and their throats vibrated with the beginnings of their welcoming song to their young.<br><br>&quot;Cripes, it&#39;s starting!&quot; she yelped aloud. She dashed back to her place by the eggs and started thrusting them toward the nearest agents, Teyala, Des, and Dawn. &quot;There, go! When they hatch, feed them, and make sure to think loving thoughts!&quot;<br><br>Rather than waiting for the rest to come to her, she gathered up a few more eggs in her shirt and took them around. Gerry, Colt, Bosh&#39;Guk, Shui&#39;Hua, and Alleb soon found themselves receiving both an egg and a repetition of the admonishment she&#39;d given the others—food and love, that was the ticket.<br><br>That just left one egg beginning to rock in the sand, its fate still undecided. Jenni looked from the egg to the Notary, frowning. She looked around for Wobbles, who was supposed to be the egg&#39;s owner. Would she come to claim it, or was she resigned to her partner&#39;s deception? Really, Jenni had half a mind to give it to Ilraen, consequences be damned. The hatchling would be lucky to have him.<br><br>She watched her Andalite friend, who had taken initiative when he saw Jenni scrambling to deliver eggs and started delivering meat. Everyone would be settled in no time. She could pull him aside the moment this little one broke shell, and that would be that. Yes. That&#39;s what she would do.<br><br><hr>
<br>(( No, that&#39;s not going to happen—but the ball&#39;s in your court, Scape. Wobbles could claim the egg and give it to her partner at this point, or the Notary could take heart from Brightbeard, drop the arrogance, and say something to win her over. Or just snatch it. That is also a thing that could happen.<br><br>(( Everyone else, please feel free to proceed from Jenni shoving an egg at you followed shortly by Ilraen shoving a bowl of meat at you, unless you had them already. Individual hatchings begin tomorrow! ))</p>

Realising he was hyperventilating, he took a couple of deep breaths.<br>Staring at the egg intently, he waited for the first cracks to appear. <i>I shall named you Khataltelet and cuddle you and cherish you</i> was the mantra going through his head, full of squeeing and big smiles and good cups of tea — along with a few loving thoughts of Dawn that managed to sneak in.</p>

            <p>... it slipped from her fingers and she started fumbling it for some excruciating moments.  By the moment she had finally settled the egg on her hands, she turned to see the bowl of meat that Ilraen had politely left there for her. She missed the entirety of the admonishment given to her, but ws at least able to overhear a part of the one given those near her.<br><br>She set the egg on the sand, near the bowl, kneeled and sat on her heels, staring at the egg. Loving thoughts? She haven&#39;t had those in a long time. What should she think about? Her family? No, that would make her cry... Tea? Yeah, tea would be; a nice cup of hot, steaming, aromatic jasmine tea...<br><br>((Well, regarding the bag of tea; we could say is a medium-sized bag, that could anything last from a week to a month, depending on the consumption routine of the drinker. Technician Liu only receives 12 bags of those per year, via... uh... secret methods, so she has to measure her consumption carefully. Essentially, she&#39;s forfeiting an entire month of her supply for this.))<br><br>((And well... Agent Des didn&#39;t exactly stole the teapot... At the end of that RP Shui-Hua told to Agent Des to return the teapot once he finished, and there was never a follow-up to that RP; so I just assumed that Agent!Des forgot to return it XD))</p>

            <p>The bowl of giant murderchicken - she refused to dignify it with some special name - was within easy reach. Suddenly, she realised she was holding the egg, standing next to its fellows, without recalling walking over there. This is unusual in a being with a perfect memory, but she paid it no mind.<br><br>It was... strange to touch. Oddly slimy, and deeply unpleasant, as if it was trying to get itself out of her grip. She was thinking of what to name the thing when its shell began to shatter in her grasp. Instinctively, she produced her trusty skewer and neatly kebabbed a few of the lumps of meat, though alas a barbeque or similar was not to hand. It irked her; animals may eat their food raw, but cooked meat was easier for biological digestive systems to break down and would therefore be more suitable for young things.<br><br>She tried to think loving thoughts at it, as was suggested. She recalled her last regeneration, as might be expected. She knew what it felt like to love, though being love remained a mystery that too often concealed a trap.<br><br>And the truth of it was, as the shell began breaking in her hands, she wasn&#39;t entirely sure she knew how to love any more.<br><br>She had totally ignored the paladin&#39;s comments; redemption was for people. She was totally ignoring Jenni, whom she was certain would not approve of her having swept in to scoop up the egg. Her considerable brainpower was almost entirely focused on the egg, despite Wobbles&#39;s jumping up and down and shouting. She expected it to run. Indeed, she rather knew it would. But that was no reason not to try.<br><br>&quot;I&#39;ll call you Lola,&quot; she said, &quot;whoever you are.&quot;<br><br>And whoever-it-was began to break free, and so did the Time Lord holding her.</p>

Something tapped on the inside--a <i>baby fire-lizard, that was a baby fire-lizard, aaaah!</i>--and she hurriedly found a clear space on the sandy floor of the RC, looking around and mimicking the people she saw kneeling. She put the meat to one side, happy to let go of it--the bowl was rather heavy, and she was never all that eager to touch raw meat--and held the egg carefully in one arm while she hollowed out a dip in the sand for it to rest in. With that done, she put the egg down and watched it rock, wide-eyed and fascinated.<br><br>Loving thoughts, hm? That would hardly be difficult. There was a new hatchling coming to join her RC--a baby fire-lizard. Would the mini-Balrogs like the hatchling? Probably, and the tribble liked just about everyone. The pov and Tafe she was less sure about, but likely they would get along just fine. After all, a baby fire-lizard was precious and probably adorable (of course adorable, the adult ones were <i>awesome</i>, she couldn&#39;t picture a hatchling <i>not</i> being cute)--and if there were problems, well, she would sort something out. Maybe Des could take an extra mini, or T&#39;Zar, or even the Nursery--she&#39;d still be able to see them, but a telempathic hatchling would have to come first...<br><br>Wait, loving thoughts.<br><br>She stared down at the egg, considering for all of two seconds before lying down on her stomach with her head propped up on her hands. The egg rocked some more; very, very carefully, she reached out to touch the shell.<br><br>&quot;Hullo, sweetheart,&quot; she said with the soft tone and gentle smile that she generally reserved for children and some kinds of pets. &quot;We&#39;re going to meet soon, you and I. We&#39;ll be the best of friends.&quot; She pulled her hand back as the egg rocked harder, not daring to get in the way. &quot;I&#39;m going to love you so much, you know. We all will. It may get busy at times, and you&#39;re probably going to see me in some strangely bouncy moods, but it&#39;s going to be so much fun. You&#39;ll see, darling. You&#39;re going to have all the love and attention you can stand, and if that isn&#39;t enough, you just tell me, because I bet there&#39;ll be more to be found. Well, maybe not attention, I have to go on missions, but I promise to love you, and care for you, and be your friend. We&#39;ll have a fantastic time, just you wait and--&quot; She froze, eyes wide.<br><br>There it was again. A tap on the inside of the shell.<br><br>Dawn scrambled back into a sitting position and pulled the bowl of meat close, wondering with a trace of disgust if she would have to actually touch it to feed the hatchling. Probably. Oh well; it wasn&#39;t like she&#39;d never touched anything squishy before, and it would be worth it for the little fire-lizard...<br><br>Another tap, louder this time. Dawn held her breath and waited.<br><br><i>Come on, then,</i> she thought. <i>Time for us to meet. This is going to be</i> fun.<br><br>The baby fire-lizard tapped again, and the first crack appeared on the shell.<br><br>--<br><br>((So the Notary broke me. Scape, you wrote a thing and broke me, I can&#39;t even. <i>Lola</i>.<br><br>Also, &#39;giant murderchicken&#39;. Fantastic :D<br><br>Basically? Thank you. That was so wonderful to read. I&#39;m so happy you&#39;ve chosen to write in the PPC--we&#39;d really be missing out on some fantastic wordsmithing if you hadn&#39;t.

            <p>(( Let&#39;s hope it won&#39;t come to that. ^_^; But, if it does, we will be good RPers and let the character&#39;s owner decide whether to accept injury or try to evade it. I think we can trust Scape to play fair, right, Scape?<br><br>(( In other news, I am so very, very amused right now. ))<br><br>If the Notary was unruffled by Jenni&#39;s threat, Jenni found herself almost laughing at the Time Lady&#39;s absurd hauteur and ignorance. Sweet Powers, it had been too long since she&#39;d had someone this entertaining around. What on Earth, or off it, got a person wound up this tight? She would have loved to find out—pushing the Notary&#39;s buttons would be too fun—but now was not the time. She couldn&#39;t let this woman upset the hatching.<br><br>She was already set to stifle her amusement when the Notary tripped, making it that much more difficult. Her hands flew to her mouth to cover her grin, contorted as it was by trying so hard not to do it.<br><br>&quot;Dafydd?&quot; she managed to mumble to the elf. &quot;Would you mind taking over here for a bit? I really, really have to deal with her.&quot;<br><br>She stood up and came up behind the Notary, reaching to take her elbow in a gesture she hoped would be construed as more supportive than restraining, although of course it was both. ~Hear me, Time Lady,~ she projected, using her own personal brand of telempathy. It was a fluid thing, filling up the gaps between words with sense and meaning, conforming to the listener&#39;s mental pathways rather than forcing itself upon them. ~I need you to understand what&#39;s at stake if you screw this up in your arrogance, so hap this.~<br><br>She had spent a lifetime as a harper and then a Weyrwoman in an alternate Pern. She&#39;d experienced every aspect there was to living with dragonkind. She&#39;d Impressed her first little friend, Cain, at the age of fourteen; she recalled his frightening hunger upon hatching, and the joy she&#39;d felt when she realized that she could feel his satisfaction and love for her when he finally curled up to sleep nestled in the crook of her arm. That was what Impression was all about. A new hatchling didn&#39;t know anything except that it needed to eat, <i>now</i>. If you weren&#39;t receptive and responsive to that need, the creature would look elsewhere; and if you frightened it, it could very well be startled <i>between</i> and die, and that would upset everyone, souring the whole event.<br><br>Jenni knew what it was like. She&#39;d felt the anguish of her dragon when she lost a clutch due to the lack of proper Hatching Grounds. She&#39;d felt each loss when someone under her care was badly Threadscored and vanished <i>between</i> forever. Each tragedy was felt by the entire population of her Weyr. Dragons and fire-lizards keened eerily at the passing of one of their kind; their eyes whirled in distressed violets; heads drooped; color was poor. Those who looked to them went about with drawn faces, struggled to keep up their own spirits to help their friends until the sting of immediacy faded.<br><br>She showed all this to the Notary.<br><br>~Don&#39;t you dare let us in for that here, today. Don&#39;t you <i>dare</i>. I don&#39;t know what your deal is, but if you&#39;re not serious about having a companion who will care for you, who you must care for in return, for life, then get out. There are others here who are capable of sharing themselves with love. Are you?~<br><br><hr>
<br>(( Apologies for passing the buck there, hS.<br><br>(( Notary, dear, now would be an excellent time for some honesty. [Also, where is Wobbles in all this?]<br><br>(( Her theory about Jenni is very interesting, by the way. Wrong, but interesting. {= ) ))</p>

            <p>Guys. Seriously. 22 posts in, what, two? three? hours is that &quot;running away with the RP&quot; thing you&#39;re not supposed to do. I can&#39;t keep up with this, and it screws up the timing in-universe, and we&#39;re still missing a player, to boot. Kindly knock it off. Give other people a chance to react and interact, or it&#39;s not fun for everybody.<br><br>And yes, I WILL turn this RP around and go home if it happens again.

Her every movement was refined, delicate, measured. A human who knew ballet would have recalled a performance of Coppélia, albeit (had they known the Notary) perhaps one in which the prima ballerina was in fact a large and ungainly filing cabinet.<br><br>Her partner, on the other hand, was bouncing off the walls.<br><br>&quot;We&#39;re gonna see a <i>dragon</i> oh my <i>goodness</i> it&#39;s a <i>dragon</i> it has <i>teeth</i> and <i>scales</i> and a <i>crest</i> and-&quot;<br><br>&quot;Human, if you&#39;ll recall, so does the Skink who works in one of the support departments, and you didn&#39;t much care for him.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yeah! Because <i>he</i> wasn&#39;t a <i>dragon</i>!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Technically, neither is this - it&#39;s a Pernese fire lizard, which is the draconic equivalent of Vegemite. Either you love them or you have taste.&quot;<br><br>&quot;But, but it&#39;s supposed to be a <i>dragon</i>!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Didn&#39;t you read the pamphlet on them that the other human sent us?&quot;<br><br>It should here be noted that the Notary had only glanced at the cover.<br><br>&quot;Uh... bits? I mean, it took a while and four different consoles, but I got most of it!&quot;<br><br>The Notary placed her head in her hands. &quot;Rassilon&#39;s bones, human, it was in dead tree format as well...&quot;<br><br>&quot;Uh, it was? I didn&#39;t check the mail that morning, you did.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yes, you bloated magic-eye painting, it was. Here.&quot; The Notary shoved a hand in her robe pocket and shuffled it around inside for a bit. &quot;One pamphlet. Near mint. Slight dogear on page 4. Probably.&quot;<br><br>&quot;... That you&#39;re holding.&quot;<br><br>The Time Lady stopped dead; Wobbles bounced off down the corridor before realising she sort of had to go back.<br><br>&quot;Ah. Well, you could have asked me for it!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Okay! Can I have the pamphlet?&quot; Wobbles turned on her most endearing grin. &quot;Pleeeeeeeeeeeeeeease?&quot;<br><br>&quot;... No,&quot; replied the Notary, and shoved it back in her pocket. There was a crunch of something inside, and when her hand came back out it was bleeding, but she didn&#39;t pay it any mind. &quot;Now come on, I need a paper shredder and you need to seek professional help. We both need to meet this Robinson woman and the others. Perhaps I can offer something they will appreciate...&quot;<br><br>&quot;Hi!&quot; Wobbles yelled past her. &quot;I think I remember you! You did a thing once, and then she did, and then everything went to poop for someone who&#39;s actually kinda nice! Okay, so that doesn&#39;t narrow things down, but still. Hi! Again!&quot;<br><br>The Notary looked up from the blood on her hand to Alex Dives, known associate of DoSAT and sundry other concerns.<br><br>&quot;Then again,&quot; she mumbled, &quot;perhaps not.&quot;</p>

She had spent the day before, cutting it to more manageable pieces; there was enough metal in that box to make an entire set of Mandalorian Armor, or perhaps two. Also, she put in there the bag of Iroh&#39;s jasmine tea and the pendant that used to identify her as a member of the Southern Water Tribe, she didn&#39;t wanted it anymore, she didn&#39;t want to remember the war anymore.<br><br>She shook those thoughts off her head, and scanned the room, setting her gaze on the blonde teenager there. <i>&quot;Alex Dives?

Since it wasn&#39;t specified, I brought inside that box about 30 pounds of Mandalorian iron, and  put in there the other items too. I might get more metal if you need it.&quot; She stretched and rubbed her back. &quot;<i>Augh</i>... I think I might need an aspirin.&quot;</p>

We&#39;ve left Hera and Ilwion at home in case they have problems with the Impression thing, but, uh... did we need to?

            <p>Or, more accurately, she noticed his father&#39;s exasperation and the child at which it was directed. Thus, she swept into action. It was going to be tricky, but it could be done.<br><br>And after a few minutes, it was. The elaborate balloon fire lizard was complete, though certain aspects of it had been rather more difficult than she&#39;d though. She then bounced over to Tanfin with it in tow.<br><br>&quot;Heya, kiddo! We met before, about a year ago, and it&#39;s so nice to see you again! Now, I know your dad said you can&#39;t have a little dragon friend of your own, being a big ol&#39; meanie, but they can be real difficult to look after. But! You&#39;ve still got a friend here, if you want him! &#39;Cause I bet he wants to be your friend too! Ain&#39;t that right, Mister Fire Lizard?&quot;<br><br>The inflatable lizard was squeezed around the middle briefly, and went <i>RAAAAAAR</i>. This... was not even close to how the beasts actually sounded, but it was how dragons were supposed to sound, according to Wobbles&#39;s unique worldview.<br><br>---<br><br>Meanwhile, the Notary was trying to ignore the displeasure rolling off the other agents in waves. Since this was the Notary, it was simplicity itself; she had totally discarding other people&#39;s anger and distaste down to a fine art. She contented herself with taking out a dataslate and filing a request for automated smartdust surveillance of proceedings... then a request to cancel the previous request. It was something to do, and if it technically meant that a request for some additional electronic equipment coming from the Grunt&#39;s RC was significantly delayed, well, that was merely bureaucracy in action.<br><br>She allowed herself a glance around her surroundings in between reports, almost immediately regretting it. Doctor Manhattan&#39;s fat crotch glowstick glared cycloptically at her from various positions on the walls, and she put in a request to both censure and censor the dragon. There were technically children present, after all, even if they were from a race of pointy-eared backwoods hippies.</p>

            <p>&quot;It could not <i>possibly</i> be because my partner is a professional imbecile. My ire is genetic. Such an unfortunate being is the Time Grump; doomed to wander the multiverse forever with two shrivelled hearts, being constantly irritated by small trivial things.&quot; The Notary&#39;s tone made it crystal clear which small and trivial things she meant... or it did to an adult. Whether or not Jasmine twigged, we can only speculate.<br><br>Still, she was forced to remember the slight smell of burnt hair that clung to her fellow Councillor for some time afterwards. This may have accounted for the grin spreading across her face like a particularly unpleasant oil slick; it&#39;s the sort of smile nobody wants directed at anyone, least of all a little girl.<br><br>Wobbles, meanwhile, just continued to smile like an actual person. She got out another fistful of sculpting balloons and got to work, instead electing to try the Last Homely House.

            <p>Eamon Brightbeard had received his message from Voltarmi while in the middle of smithing an battle axe.  It wasn&#39;t the sort of thing that one could simply set aside.  So, Brightbeard finished what he was doing, ran a damp cloth over his face and hands to cleanse himself of soot and metal shavings, and pulled on a linen shirt.  He was not prone to hurrying.  He&#39;d lived long enough to know that little good ever came of running off half-cocked (or quarter-cocked in his partner&#39;s case).<br><br>He knew his way to Voltarmi&#39;s office, having visited often.  He reminded himself that he had to travel upwards, red-wise, take a left at the spotted cucumber demon and balance on his clockwise foot.  This all, being incredibly hard to envision, served as a suitable distraction to get him where he wanted to be.  He smoothed his beard and opened the door.<br><br>He was immediately greeted by a small child, an harried elf, and a RAAAAAAR.  Brightbeard smiled warmly as he stepped onto the sand.  This was going to be a wonderful experience.</p>

One end of long blue and green scarf trailed from her shoulder; the rest of it had been wrapped loosely around her neck and once around her waist. A small bottle of Retcon tablets rattled in her pocket, next to the TOS medical scanner. She looked around, wondering why so many people were there. Surely they couldn&#39;t all be here for the eggs...<br><br>Her gaze fell on a group that included five children and an Elf who seemed oddly familiar. What was--no. Impossible. Maglor Feanorion had no children, except briefly for Elrond and Elros (sort of), but--no, wait. There had been a DOGA agent connected to the First Age Elf in some way, hadn&#39;t there? Not too long before she&#39;d joined, too. Only then he&#39;d died, and been somehow brought back to life, and this was actually rather confusing, she&#39;d have to go looking for the details at some point--and speaking of details, why was there sand on the floor? Was it a temporary thing to make the fire-lizards feel more at home? And who was the two-headed agent? And all the other people, for that matter? And she should really find the agents who were trading the eggs at some point soon...</p>

            <p>(( First, a couple clarifications:<br><br>1. Nume already left with an egg and bowl of wherry-meat for the Lichen. I did not make this at all clear; I was in a hurry. I apologize for the confusion.<br><br>2. So there&#39;s a pamphlet and a guidebook. The pamphlet, circulated to the agents ahead of time, would&#39;ve contained basic information about what fire-lizards are and what to expect at the hatching [I&#39;m going to go over this IC as a &quot;refresher,&quot; too, so don&#39;t worry about it], and probably included the three points covered at the top of the guide, because they&#39;re important. Jenni is going to hand out the guidebooks at the end of the hatching.<br><br>... Was there anything else? I think that&#39;s it. Now to try and work in reactions to all the things. ))<br><br><hr>
<br>Jenni boggled at Shui-Hua&#39;s box a moment before recovering her composure and smiling at the tech. &quot;Wow, that&#39;s a lot of iron! It&#39;s not for me, though—I only wanted the tea. You can give the whole box to Ilraen for now.&quot; She nodded toward the blue-furred Andalite standing by the desk at the other end of the room.<br><br>From the top of said desk, Voltarmi replied to Alex&#39;s question: &quot;In about thirteen minutes.&quot; Her gnomish voice was piping high, and quite easily carried across the space.<br><br>Teyala&#39;s arrival caught Henry&#39;s attention. Here was someone he knew! Not as well as some of the other Nursery workers, sure, but still. &quot;Hi, Lala!&quot; He grinned and waved at her. &quot;I didn&#39;t know <i>you</i> were getting an egg.&quot;<br><br>But all conversation was interrupted by the Illians&#39; rambunctious lot arriving on the scene.<br><br>Jenni just managed to squeak a reply to Dafydd&#39;s question—&quot;Of course they can!&quot;—before he was distracted again, and she wasn&#39;t at all sure he&#39;d heard her. Normally she would have jumped in to help, but she had eggs to supervise.<br><br>Henry watched the kids with wide eyes. He vaguely knew the older ones from Bud activities, but they were in different posies and didn&#39;t get together much. And they were outsiders, anyway. They didn&#39;t stay in the Nursery during the day like everybody else, but actually went off somewhere Outside, with their parents. That was weird. But, in some indefinable way, it made them cool, too.<br><br>He didn&#39;t mind that they hadn&#39;t noticed him, though, because Wobbles hadn&#39;t noticed him, either, and he preferred it that way. She was funny on TV, but up close she was really loud and really big, and he didn&#39;t want to talk to her. He&#39;d just stay on the desk and watch, like he was supposed to, and that would be okay.<br><br>When it looked like things were settling down and Henry still hadn&#39;t made a move to interact with the other kids, Ilraen looked down and put a hand on his shoulder. &lt;Henry? Will you not go and say hello to the other children? Perhaps you could all watch the hatching together! Would that not be fun?&gt;<br><br>&quot;Oh,&quot; Henry said, as though this thought were to banal to have crossed his mind before. &quot;I guess so.&quot; He hopped down off the desk and scuffled through the sand to where the Illians had herded their flock. Resisting the urge to suck a finger out of nervousness, he shoved one hand into a pocket and waved at them with the other. &quot;Hiya, Tanfin. Jazzy. Bella.&quot;<br><br>Meanwhile, Jenni realized that several other agents had arrived during the commotion. By her count, only three were missing and they&#39;d probably be along any second now, so she thought she ought to start talking and get some semblance of order in place.<br><br>&quot;Hi, everyone!&quot; she called out, waving a hand in the air for attention. &quot;Glad you&#39;ve made it! If you would, please go ahead and give Ilraen whatever you brought to trade, then pick up a bowl of meat from the dolly over there. Yes, it&#39;s supposed to be that color, don&#39;t worry.&quot; It occurred to her belatedly that the dark green copper-based ichor might be worrisome to people who&#39;d never encountered it before. &quot;Then you can come to me for your egg, and just find a spot anywhere to settle in. Thank you!&quot;<br><br><hr>
<br>(( ... I think wherries have ichor. The <i>Dragonlover&#39;s Guide</i> doesn&#39;t say, but I don&#39;t know why they wouldn&#39;t.<br><br>Hey, who remembers the <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Sprout_Movement">Sprout movement</a>? I do! {= D ))</p>

            <p>It probably depends on the fire-lizard. The queen of the clutch Menolly Impressed from didn&#39;t seem to mind, but she and Menolly were already sort of friends. Wild fairs will probably either try to defend the clutch (I think the fair Sorka ran into did this?) or just go into hiding and hope the nest goes unnoticed (the fairmates of F&#39;nor&#39;s clutch were nowhere to be seen); probably depends on the size of the fair and how experienced/confident the gold is.<br><br>If Hera&#39;s a particularly protective mother, she might be anxious (she&#39;s already had her eggs stolen once!), but if Constance reassures her, she should be fine, and if she&#39;s fine, Ilwion should be fine.<br><br>Plus, it would be neat to have them humming for the full hatching experience. ^_^<br><br>As for the Lichen, I wasn&#39;t planning on it being present, but if it&#39;s already on its way and catches Nume in the hallway, the plan could change? Personally, I don&#39;t want to have to visualize a big, fuzzy green mat moving around and using psychically-controlled cyber-arms. Kinda freaks me out!<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

Implausible Crossovers had the start of a flooding problem- complete with krakens- they were hoping to cut off before it required pumping and a good portion of Response Centers  in Geographic Aberrations and Floaters had no water at all, including the Floating Hyacinth&#39;s office. Unfortunately, all of that was on top of their normal workload, so the day was already a trying one. <br><br>They made it to the office the eggs were in holding at a decent enough time, but found there were already plenty of people inside when Gerry opened the door. &quot;This is a surprise,&quot; she said cheerfully. &quot;I didn&#39;t know there&#39;d be this many people around.&quot;  She then yanked Colt, who was too busy looking at the elf kids (or the balloon dragon, it was sometimes hard to tell) through the doorway with her, giving a brief wave at Jenni and the two Detanglers as she did. <br><br>&quot;Yowch! You could have said something,&quot; the half-elf complained, but it quickly turned into a grin as he laid eyes on the eggs, while looking around at everyone else. &quot;How much longer do we have left?&quot; </p>

            <p>With the children settled (which took longer than it might have - Oleander woke up from his nap, and Dafydd spent some time persuading him that no, he couldn&#39;t have Daphne&#39;s balloon - or Tanfin&#39;s hat - or Jasmine&#39;s ear), Constance turned to her husband. &quot;So what did she say?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Um?

If you need any help with your children, please let me know. I would be happy to assist you. Well, before the hatching begins, anyway.&quot;<br><br>Dafydd blinked. &quot;Do we look like we can&#39;t- wait, never mind, we kind of do.&quot;<br><br>Constance chuckled. &quot;What, you don&#39;t think the Rampant Horde exudes a feeling of complete - Jasmine, get down from the console or Makes-Things will get you - control?&quot;<br><br>&quot;It could be worse; no-one&#39;s riding around on a gigantic hound.&quot; Dafydd smiled one-sidedly at some memory. &quot;Um, thank you, Teyala; I think we&#39;ll be okay.&quot;<br><br>&quot;About that <i>we</i>.&quot; Constance plucked the Remote Activator from Dafydd&#39;s belt and pulled up a portal. &quot;I&#39;m going to fetch Her Majesty. Back in a minute.&quot;<br><br>Dafydd watched her go, then turned back to Teyala. &quot;I say <i>okay</i>...&quot;<br><br>A six-year-old boy Dafydd vaguely recognised from Bud activities wandered over, one hand in his pocket. &quot;Hiya, Tanfin. Jazzy. Bella.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Henry!&quot; exclaimed Jasmine. &quot;I haven&#39;t seen you in <i>for. ever.</i>&quot;<br><br>Tanfin snorted. &quot;You saw him two weeks ago at the Pointless Party. Remember?&quot;<br><br>Jasmine glared at her brother. &quot;<i>For. Ever.</i>&quot; she repeated.<br><br>Meanwhile, Bella had ignored her siblings and walked straight over to Henry. She looked him up and down with an expression of deep thought, then wrapped her arms around him in. &quot;Henry!&quot; she squeaked.<br><br>Dafydd shook his head, smiling. &quot;Yes, I think we&#39;ll be okay. Thank you, though.&quot;<br><br>The portal reappeared, and Constance stepped through. She had a fire lizard on either shoulder - gold Hera looking imperiously around, bronze Ilwion seemingly half-asleep. &quot;Oh, hi, Henry,&quot; she said, pointing the RA and shutting the portal.<br><br>As Jenni started talking, Hera hopped into the air and glided across to the rough circle of eggs. She landed lightly in the middle of the clutch and made a soft crooning noise, nudging a couple of the eggs with her snout.<br><br>Constance glanced at Dafydd. &quot;I think you need to get over there. If she gets possessive...&quot;<br><br>&quot;Right.&quot; Dafydd scooped Ilwion off Constance&#39;s shoulder and plonked him on his own. &quot;Good luck with the kids.&quot; He kissed his wife on the cheek and hurried off across the room.<br><br>&quot;It&#39;s all right, Your Majesty,&quot; he murmured, kneeling down as close to Hera as he could get. &quot;We talked about this, remember? They&#39;re going to good people.&quot;<br><br>Ilwion fluttered down onto the sand at his mate&#39;s side and rubbed his neck against hers; Hera made a quiet sound, but her eyes were a slow purplish-red, and she seemed content to leave the eggs alone.<br><br>Dafydd glanced up at Jenni. &quot;She should be fine. At least I think she should.&quot;<br><br><hr>
<br><br>Miscellaneous notes:<br><br>-Constance knows Jenni, having moonlighted in FicPsych.<br>-I&#39;ve repeated Teyala&#39;s line to keep the scene flow; obviously if someone Interludes this section it&#39;ll need reworking.<br>-Tanfin is eight now, so he&#39;s moved up to Sprouts.<br>-Neshomeh, feel free to write Hera &amp; Ilwion humming when the time comes, if you want to use them to mark the start. If you need Dafydd to get them out of the way, just ask.<br>-Yes, &#39;slow purplish-red&#39;. Fire lizard eyes are described in terms of both whirling and colour. The (a?) Pern wiki suggests purple-red is the correct colour when eggs are about to hatch.<br>-I know Dawn clocked Dafydd, but she didn&#39;t come over, so he&#39;s not reacting.<br><br>hS, adding appendices to RP posts since Iluvatar knows when</p>

            <p>And she smiled much wider as she wandered around the room, looking for a buffet table to pillage in the name of Cap&#39;n Wobb, The Pirate Clown - wow, she really had to bring that girl back, it had been months since her last appearance on the show and she <i>loved</i> playing her. In any event, she saw a motley bunch of agents, support personnel, and assorted operatives, and felt... content. This was, bar one, a hive of good people and good things, doing their best to make other people happy. She was confident everyone here could come together to make a bad ting good, as the old saying had it (okay, it was actually the theme tune to <i>Rastamouse</i>, but it was probably an old saying <i>somewhere</i>), so she abandoned her quest for little stick-mounted nibbly things and went off to find the Notary.<br><br>As she got closer, it was obvious that her partner had overheard Dafydd&#39;s words too. She was sitting down and focused on her datapad, her body ramrod straight and apparently able to ignore the broken glass sticking out of her right knuckles. &quot;Human,&quot; she said without looking up, &quot;why are you lumbering towards me? Surely there are some small humans for you to allegedly entertain. I notice that Former Agent Illian has quite the collection, though it does make one long for the days of collecting with poison and pin.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Uh, but you&#39;re a Time Lord, not a pokeyman, Agent Ovaltine. I don&#39;t think Time Lords can learn Poison Pin. Is that even a move?&quot; The Pokémon games themselves were a closed book to the clown, but she&#39;d watched as much of the anime as she&#39;d had time to down at the A/V Division and she knew children and adults alike loved them.<br><br>&quot;How on Earth should I know, human? Stop jabbering. I am trying to concentrate. I mean, look at these 15-Bs - oh, no, you can&#39;t, can you? Slipped my mind. One wonders if Supernumerary is even aware of the Unofficial Bureaucratic Style Guide...&quot;<br><br>&quot;Didn&#39;t you write that?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Well, yes, as a matter of fact I did.&quot; The Notary preened at that, which was slightly disturbing.<br><br>&quot;Didja send it to him?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I published it. I may have had to self-publish it, mostly with the printer credits of dormant accounts, but it is available in physical and digital forms.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Okay! Only, I know they&#39;re in those boxes in the RC and none of them have been opened yet, so-&quot;<br><br>&quot;It is hardly my fault if people elect to ignore good advice when I offer it to them for a reasonable charge in line with similar texts for sale at any reputable university, and even the thoroughly disreputable ones on what you people call &#39;World One&#39;.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I... guess so! I mean, you obviously put a lot of work into it, so, uh, yeah! I&#39;m sure someone will buy it eventually! For a reason!&quot;<br><br>The Notary sniffed in reply and went back to her filing. Blood occasionally spattered to the floor when the fingers on her right hand flexed, staining the sand by her chair an unattractive shade of maroon. &quot;Human, you&#39;re still here. Remedy this.&quot;<br><br>Wobbles bounced off, slightly smugly. Her partner just sat, and watched, and tried very hard not to stick her hand in the pocket of her robes and fish out something to stare at.</p>

            <p>Here&#39;s who&#39;s invited and what their characters promised to exchange for their egg, in case you need a reminder:<br><br>1. Iximaz - Alex Dives - TOS model tricorder<br>2. Alleb - Agent Alleb - one masterwork Naysmithe dagger<br>3. Phobos - Eamon Brightbeard - keeping Barid out of the way plus smithwork TBD<br>4. Scapegrace - Wobbles (but actually the Notary) - general clerking for one year<br>5. Darkotas - Bosh&#39;Guk - some healing potions? maybe a spellbook? (I forgot we hadn&#39;t actually gotten this settled. &gt;.&gt; )<br>6. Desdendelle - Agent Des - Avatar Aang&#39;s lightsaber (the guys decided they didn&#39;t need the sword)<br>7. PoorCynic - Teyala Solnerii - Pennacook Club interviews<br>8. Huinesoron - the Lichen - because it&#39;s the Lichen. (Dafydd, Constance &amp; family are also cordially invited to watch the hatching if they so choose. It seems only polite!)<br>9. JulyFlame - Building Maintenance reps - three favors, electrical work sans console, one job expedited<br>10. DawnFire - Dawn McKenna - TOS medical scanner, Retcon, one scarf<br>11. Edhelistar - Shui-Hua Liu - Mandalorian iron plus Water Tribe pendant (since she seems to want to get rid of it) and Iroh&#39;s jasmine tea (which Jenni is claiming as her fee for helping out)<br>12. ... <br><br>So, about number twelve. There&#39;s still a spot left! I&#39;m inclined to give the extra egg to Building Maintenance, since IC they&#39;ll probably get the most use out of a fire-lizard helper and it&#39;s always a good idea to keep the janitors on your good side. BUT! before that&#39;s set in stone, I wanna extend one last chance for another Boarder to put up a character for Impression. If you want in, please let me know what character you&#39;re using and what they&#39;re offering to Nume and Ilraen in trade, preferably in the form of an ICEP message, since that&#39;s what everyone else did. Please do this <b>within 24 hours of the time of this post</b>. After that, the offer expires and BM gets the egg.<br><br><a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=241484;article=5672;title=PPC%20Message%20Board">With that, here&#39;s the RP!</a> If you&#39;re already in, post away!

            <p>(Because it&#39;s only halfway to being a response.)<br><br>Nita Kerys prodded vaguely at her meal. The schedule at Building Maintenance had been a bit hectic recently, so her breaks were coming at essentially random times. Two hours after breakfast was far too early for lunch, even when those hours had been occupied pumping out floodwaters from Implausible Crossovers (something about an unbalanced pressure differential, apparently). But if she didn&#39;t eat, she knew she&#39;d be starving by the end of her shift.<br><br>A commotion across the Courtyard drew her attention. A bunch of small animals - no, those were Pokemon - seemed to be squabbling. As Nita watched, two of them fled into the grass - and then the third slammed its hands into the ground.<br><br>The tremour wasn&#39;t enough to throw Nita from her bench, but <i>did</i> roll her tomatoes off her plate. &quot;Oh, come <i>on</i>,&quot; she muttered. &quot;Those were the only thing I was looking forward to!&quot;<br><br>There was a blaze of light as the fourth Pokemon shot a bolt of electricity at the third, then leapt for its throat, teeth glittering with lightning. Nita winced as the Pokemon&#39;s opponent went down.<br><br>&quot;Sometimes,&quot; she murmured, &quot;I wonder if we had the right idea after all. Powers like that... how can we even know whether an agent&#39;s Suvian or not, if they can throw lightning around like confetti?&quot; She paused, chuckled. &quot;Or like coriandoli, as that Italian guy would be quick to point out.&quot;<br><br>One of the runaways had returned, and was now rooting frantically through an armoured vest of some kind. Nita&#39;s eyes narrowed. &quot;Wait... that dog-thing is from the <i>DIA</i>?&quot;<br><br>She watched as the returning Pokemon fed the dog-thing something from the vest - then as the dog leapt up and punched the lightning-one clear across the lawn.<br><br>&quot;That&#39;s not right,&quot; she said, half-rising from her seat. &quot;Internal Affairs aren&#39;t meant to... even <i>we</i> would never have beaten up an agent in public like that! That&#39;s...&quot; She stopped herself just before saying it, but the words hung in the air in front of her: <i>That&#39;s what the DIS did.</i><br><br>Nita watched the rest of the abortive fight: the arrival of the human DIA Agent, his care for the fallen electric Pokemon, the portal out. Then, very slowly, she bent down and picked up one of her tomatoes from the floor, dusted it off, and bit into it.<br><br>Her radio crackled. &quot;Hey, Nita,&quot; came the voice from another member of her team, &quot;did you decide to take the day off or something? We&#39;ve got krakens coming out of our ears down here; get a move on!&quot;<br><br>Nita snorted and tapped the button. &quot;We can sell &#39;em to the Cafeteria as calamari,&quot; she said. &quot;Give me a minute, I&#39;ll be right down.&quot;<br><br><hr>
<br><br>Um, yeah. Having written Internal Security to highlight exactly what Internal Affairs should never do, it&#39;s a bit alarming to see members of the DIA... doing exactly what they did.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>... that this is going to lead to another &#39;can I ask you guys to be more forthcoming with that sort of thing&#39; post, isn&#39;t it? So I&#39;ll &#39;spell out&#39; what I meant by my closing comment:<br><br>Beating people up is bad. Having DIA agents who beat people up is very bad. Saying that they will be punished/kicked out for it is good. Giving writers the impression that the DIA are prone to beating people up is bad. Giving <i>agents</i> the impression that the DIA are prone to beating people up is very bad.<br><br>The DIA originally existed for one reason: to bring in agents who had snapped and were a danger to themselves and their colleagues. When I wrote <i>Crashing Down</i>, that expanded to include, y&#39;know, fighting off invading armies and arresting people who were (apparently) threatening to attack HQ. As I recall, they didn&#39;t even have proper cells then.<br><br>They&#39;ve been creeping towards being the DIS Mark 2 ever since. Now we have a DIA who read people&#39;s emails, (some of) whose members think it&#39;s acceptable behaviour to publicly beat agents unconscious... yeah, no, I don&#39;t like that.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Let me assure you that Owen is meant to be a one-time thing. Scapegrace has pretty much hit the nail on the head when she points out that he has had a psychotic break. He is not representative of DIA whatsoever and I do not intend to write DIA in a manner that will bring about a second DIS. <br><br>I tried showing the break between DIA officer and this-guy-has-gone-off-the-deep-end when Owen shrugs off his DIA vest: he willingly abandons his responsibilities and his employers&#39; values in favour of his own plan of action.<br><br>I hope this clears up matters somewhat. </p>

            <p>How did we give readers the impression that the DIA is prone to beating people up? Owen was one agent who lost control, and it was stated pretty clearly in the interlude (as you noted) that this was a Bad Thing. As for other agents... um.

            <p>You showed that that incident got stepped on, yes. But you also showed us Zeb not being particularly surprised about being publically confronted in a massively-aggressive way by the DIA. The impression I got was that that&#39;s how he kind of expects the DIA to act - even though they&#39;re not supposed to. I came out with the impression that the rules are generally winked at unless someone goes way too far.<br><br>I hadn&#39;t noticed that all the DIA instances were people forwarding them (see what we mean about people getting impressions that weren&#39;t what you were aiming for?); it actually doesn&#39;t make any difference, though, because - for instance - Agent Des forwarded an email because, what, someone may have hacked his emails? And he clearly expects the DIA to do something about that? That&#39;s a very intrusive, very we-will-control-everything picture of the DIA right there, and it&#39;s one that I don&#39;t particularly like.<br><br>(But, y&#39;know, I also don&#39;t particularly like the tendency for Bad Slash missions to be high-rated, the fact that people don&#39;t use appropriate disguises, and the way the Department of Floaters has ballooned up into one of the largest in the PPC.

I really got a feel for Zeb&#39;s emotions. Owen I didn&#39;t empathise with at <i>all</i>, but... I don&#39;t think I was supposed to.

            <p>Is it really Iximaz&#39;s fault that Lacksi wasn&#39;t paying an appropriate amount of attention and misinterpreted things?  It seems to me that Lacksi&#39;s the one who needs a talking-to, not Iximaz.  I understand where the concern&#39;s coming from, but taking the attitude that people can&#39;t write certain perfectly valid stories because someone might misinterpret things in them.  If Lacksi makes poor writing decisions, that&#39;s on her.<br><br>For an alternative point of reference, I didn&#39;t see the fight as a DIA thing - I saw it as a <i>Pokemon</i> thing.  Jokes about cockfighting aside, it&#39;s canon that Pokemon enjoy battling and can be provoked to it by something as relatively harmless as a ten-year-old strolling past them.  Battling, even violently, is a perfectly natural part of their lives.  While the Pokemon agents may be more sapient than those found in canon, battling is still a natural part of their instincts.  Factor in that neither participant is overly stable at the moment, and you have the makings of a fight gone wrong.<br><br>I can&#39;t comment on the whole thing with Des.  I was under the impression that the whole hacking thing was a bit of a misfire in terms of people replying to each other in a roleplay?  </p>

            <p>So based on that, I&#39;m not entirely sure where the idea that DIA is reading people&#39;s mail in the first place is coming from.  I thought Des was just going to report a potential hacker to them, which strikes me as pretty logical.  I suppose he could have sent the message to the Department Head, but honestly the Flowers have never shown much interest in inter-agent disagreements.  I wouldn&#39;t expect them to even bother to do anything about it.</p>

            <p>DIA operatives are as susceptible to your common-or-garden psychotic break as anyone else, if not more so considering their job. Lucario are borderline-Suvian at the best of times anyway (cf. their interactions with Smash and the fact that they look like a fourteen-year-old boy&#39;s fursona), so I buy this happening the way it did. I got the sense that Owen just <i>is not coping</i> with life in the DIA, or indeed in the PPC at all, and has taken refuge in this sort of hardcore win-or-die bloodlusting berserker persona rather than face the fact that his job is scary and difficult and causes him as much mental harm as physical.<br><br>tl;dr: Owen is bad at his job and it&#39;s finally come home to roost a bit.

            <p>Because Zeb is the only name in the interlude that I actually recognize.  I had a really hard time following the story, because I couldn&#39;t stop wondering who everyone was supposed to be.  It&#39;s one thing to introduce new characters, but I felt like the default assumption was that I knew who everyone was, and I don&#39;t.  Poking around the Wiki doesn&#39;t turn up any hits.  It also loses a lot of its impact, because I don&#39;t really know anything about anyone.  It felt like I tuned into an ongoing TV show without seeing any of the previous episodes, and given that I&#39;ve been following this series pretty closely, I shouldn&#39;t be having this reaction.<br><br>On another note, I&#39;m not super fond of the overly gritty tone used for the Pokemon battle.  I know Zeb is from a Nuzlocke, but it&#39;s <i>canon</i> that Pokemon get knocked unconscious all the time and usually can recover perfectly well.  I felt like it was trying too hard to make it darker and edgier, which wasn&#39;t really necessary.  Maybe it&#39;s just personal taste, but I&#39;m not really fond of the tendency to take lighter continua and darken them just to make them seem more &quot;mature.&quot;<br><br>Sorry for being so harsh, but I feel like this one is a lot weaker than the rest of the LMM interludes.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m going to have to agree with you when you say that Owen, Buck, and Tacitus&#39; official introductions came a bit out of the blue. All three of them appeared previously in RPs found on the Other Board but I think it&#39;s unfair to assume that everyone knows about them. Compounding the fact that the RPs were canon-optional, it makes for a rather confusing set of interactions. Perhaps I should&#39;ve introduced the three of them earlier in another interlude. That would&#39;ve made much more sense than having them suddenly be here.<br><br>And don&#39;t worry about &quot;harshness&quot;: I didn&#39;t feel that your post was being unfair to us.

            <p>The Factories, like the other Sue-originators, produce Mary Sues who then go and... I guess fit into a <i>space</i> created by an author.

            <p>It seems to me that a written Sue should be able to take on life, as it were, just as a canon character would (or, if we want to get meta, as the PPC agents do). But that it&#39;s strange and contradictory makes things interesting I suppose. You know I plan to write other &quot;big picture&quot; stuff (if there&#39;s room to now) so I reserve the right to go out and jot down my own ideas and such if I feel they fit, heh. It&#39;s an interesting bit of the setting to build on, especially since the same question can in a way be asked of any character from a continuum other than World One - I&#39;m sure by some people&#39;s standards Dafyyd is no more alive than a random Sue.</p>

            <p>A brief report from the central offices at Dreams Come True, Inc, headquarters of the loyal League of Mary-Sue Factories:<br><br><hr>
<br><br>&quot;Mistress! Mistress!&quot;<br><br>The Defective was showing more agitation than her breed was prone to, waving a sheet of paper at the monitoring camera. The Venomous Tentacula sighed.<br><br><i>This is going to be annoying, isn&#39;t it?</i> She tapped a spot on her desk, and the door hissed open. <i>Yes?</i><br><br>&quot;It&#39;s the PPC, mistress!&quot; the Defective yelled, rushing into the office.<br><br>The Tentacula stiffened. <i>Here? NOW? Activate the emergency pods! Contact General Dandy! If they&#39;ve come for vengeance, we-</i><br><br>&quot;Uh, no, mistress.&quot; The Defective paused to take a breath. &quot;They&#39;re not... <i>here</i>.&quot;<br><br><i>... don&#39;t scare me like that.</i> The Venomous Tentacula coiled her tendrils around the legs of her desk. <i>Then what?</i><br><br>&quot;They&#39;ve killed... oh, mistress...&quot;<br><br><i>Is it... what&#39;s the name of Wydenbrooke&#39;s replacement? That would be a nice break...</i><br><br>&quot;Um. No.&quot; The Defective held out the paper. &quot;Rose Potter, mistress. <i>They killed Rose Potter</i>!&quot;<br><br>The Tentacula&#39;s leaves rustled. <i>... I&#39;m sorry, who?</i><br><br>The Defective couldn&#39;t keep herself from blinking. &quot;Um, one of the greatest Mary-Sues of all time? The one you referred to as &#39;the pride of the League&#39;, and &#39;the most potent creation of these Factories&#39;?&quot;<br><br><i>Oh, THAT Rose Potter. So?</i><br><br>The Defective was floundering. &quot;So... so we need to get revenge! They can&#39;t just DO that!&quot;<br><br><i>Hmm.</i> The Venomous Tentacula tapped at her desk again for a moment. <i>Why not, precisely?</i><br><br>&quot;Because... because... because they can&#39;t!&quot;<br><br><i>I see.</i> Behind the Defective, the door swung open again, and two of her pale &#39;sisters&#39; stepped in. <i>Seize her,</i> the Tentacula ordered.<br><br>&quot;What? Mistress!&quot; The Defective struggled against her captors, but they were just as strong as her. &quot;I don&#39;t understand...&quot;<br><br><i>We have produced thousands of Mary-Sues from this factory alone,</i> the Tentacula explained. <i>The loss of one, however famous it may be, does not matter one lateral.

            <p>I don&#39;t think the PPC would benefit from having a &quot;villain&quot; or &quot;foil&quot; working against it, especially not an organization of Sues. <br><br>Here&#39;s my view on this: Mary Sues are like a disease within a canon. Most of the time, they&#39;re not actively trying to destroy a canon; however, the way they are written naturally causes them to degrade the world around them, to bend the world around their existence. A badfic is like an infection within canon, and the PPC acts as an antibody. <br><br>Goodfic coexists with established canon, bad writing clashes and damages it. It&#39;s a naturally-occurring thing brought about through the worlds created by writing, not attacks on canon orchestrated by some shadowy force of corruption. In this case, think bacteria. There&#39;s a lot of different kinds within your body; some of it coexists with your immune system to strengthen it, while other kinds are harmful and cause you to get sick. It&#39;s not actively malicious, but you still get sick just because it&#39;s there. Mary Sues are like bad bacteria.<br><br>The PPC is basically a team of Almighty Janitors cleaning up a mess made by botched uses of a setting, not some army fighting against forces of evil. Having this League just wouldn&#39;t fit.</p>

            <p>Obviously my post that this was just one mission was a case of misplaced optimism.  As people said in the earlier thread, we don&#39;t want to go into a whole bunch of big Emergencies and darker plots.  Let&#39;s leave Rose Potter and Little Miss Mary where they are, instead of trying to imitate them.  Not only is it taking the PPC in a direction it&#39;s not really meant to go, it feels a bit like you&#39;re trying to use Iximaz and co&#39;s success to get more attention for your own thing.</p>

            <p>Now, I obviously didn&#39;t actually get around to even attempting to get Permission before I had to vanish (though I was considering it the time before the circunstances that caused me to do it happened) and I don&#39;t think it would it be very wise to try it right now while few people know me around here, so at this juncture this is merely a theoretical question. <br><br>But in the case of something like <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5813363/1/Adopted">Adopted</a>, which is the badfic I plan to use for my future attempt, could one use blatant disregard for World One laws as charges? <br><br>To clarify, this is a fic where one of the main concerns (along with more obvious Canon Violations, like the pairings of Harry/Hermione, Ron/Luna and Draco/Ginny, not mention the Temporal Paradox created by making Hermione younger than Harry ) is the highly illogical adoption created by the Sparkly Child Sue responsible for this Glaurunging mess.  <br><br>Harry and Hermione are both eighteen in this story, which would make this Glaurunging whole plot impossible since by British law at the time you would have to be at least twenty-one to adopt, and even then you would to have be either single, married and/or adopting the child of your spouse , and the aforementioned pair is in none of those categories. Instead, they are just two best friends who decided on the spur-of-the-moment (which is so OOC for Hermione that I can&#39;t even begin to tell you) to adopt a child together. <br><br>And that is the just the first in an endless litany of legal errors. Now, the reason I bring this up is that, to my knowledge, unless Rowling states otherwises, the Muggle world in Harry Potter should be almost exactly the same as World One, which should make things the Children Act 1989 practically canonical. <br><br>If I&#39;m wrong with this theory, one could probably just charge based on the impossibility and Illogic of the whole thing, so it would be no great loss. </p>

            <p>I mean, yeah getting the setting (in this case Muggle Britain) is certainly part of the problem. I think if one is going to write a story about something related to the real world, in this case an adoption process in the UK, then they should do the appropriate research.

            <p>Stuff like that could easily be charged for under things like &#39;failure to do the research&#39; and &#39;sending people OOC&#39;. <br><br>As for actually charging them breaking laws, well, agents don&#39;t have any real authority to do so, but that doesn&#39;t have to stop them.

            <p>Well, i did say it would probably be no great loss if it couldn&#39;t be done like I thought. &#39;Failure to do the research&#39; and &#39;making characters OC&#39; sound about right. I mean, would someone like Hermione, who is clever, knowledgeable and resourseful and prefers to only break rules when absolutely necessary, really just jump in head-first into something as life-changing as an adoption without apparently doing any research at all? Really!?  <br><br>Nice to know that there is a precedent for that sort of thing. Mind if I ask what mission that is? <br><br>Thing is, like I previously said, these problems are one of my main concerns with the badfic. So I would probably  have to find a way to make major charges about it. The above charges plus some about the impossible and Illogical plot would mostly cover it, but I still feel something would be lacking in that regard. I would still have the charges for more obvious and Canon Breaking bad writing, such as everything related to Sue herself, non canonical pairings, the aforementioned Temporal Offense and the other bad OCs in the story to make for it though.<br><br>Then we have instances where the bad writing manages to Break Canon AND cause issues related to said laws at the same time. In one particularly Glaurunging bad case, Harry and Hermione have apparently had their educational records forged to show that they attended a &quot; School for the Gifted&quot;. That may not actually break the Statute of Secrecy, but it seems pretty damn close to me, as well being incredibly stupid. I mean, what the Glaurung did they do about grades and certificates? They can&#39;t exactly list the results for O.W.L.s, you know.</p>

            <p>Yup, that&#39;s one of the great things about the PPC setting: if you look long and hard enough through the archives, you can probably find precedent for anything (of course, that could also be a bad thing, and the more you look the more likely you are to find contradictions too). <br><br>The mission I was referring to is <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1e5foSyJMlUOacJ3RPpSVFxlXGfXDgYn45omukE9YyoI/pub">here</a>, although I bet there are other examples too. <br><br>As for the faked certificates, um... maybe they had access to some <i>Doctor Who</i> psychic paper?<br><br>- Irish </p>

            <p>I don&#39;t actually know that continuum at all, but it seems like a nice mission. That part about pseudo-charging for the crimes is really interesting. <br><br>But now that I have thought more about it, something like that wouldn&#39;t work in this case. Since the Sue in question is the child being adopted herself, she is not the one who is violating the relevant laws. Maybe I could charge for &#39; altering reality and manipulating canons and OCs alike to blatantly ignore even the existence of the relevant laws&#39;?<br><br>That sounds like a major enough charge to me. After all, it is really bad writing. By disregarding such matters, the Suethor can both make things too easy on the legal process side, losing some good oppurtunity for actual well-written drama, AND also use it to heavy handingly apply the Rule of Drama. Just see how easily the Sue got adopted by Harry and Hermione (seriously, adopting a child from the Nursery is probably harder than adopting a child in this fic) and later on, how also easily she was taken away by her Obviously Evil Birth Mother. Who then beats up and treats her as a slave, of course. <br><br>You know you got it real bad with a badfic when something like that explanation could actually make more sense than what actually happens in it. </p>

            <p>As for the Sue not being the one to actually break the laws in this case, well, we have a tendency to blame the Sue for any bad writing that happens in their presence, so if you wanted to transfer that to laws/crimes you could always go with &#39;conspiracy to commit...&#39; type charges. Basically treat the Sue as the mastermind/ringleader behind any law-breaking the OOC canons do. <br><br>- Irish</p>

            <p>That was mostly what I was going for with charge I suggested in my last post. But according to that, since Harry and Hermione wouldn&#39;t be actually legally allowed to have the Sue in their custody, I guess could I probably charge for &#39;conspiracy to commit kidnapping&#39;. And for the all the laws and procedures broke by the CPS OCs. I swear, every since adult in this thing, canons and OCs, seen to be affect by her. The only salvageable characters seem to be the two child bit ones in first  chapter (though one of them does fall in the category of unreasonably hating the Sue) and maybe the baby Harry and Hermione have in the last chapter. <br><br>I will probably get to actually use pseudo-charges for broken laws with Sue&#39;s Birth Mother though, for also effectively kidnapping a child and then neglecting and abusing her. <br><br>And I will probably have to charge for having Speshul Powers, since this fic somehow make Hermione of all Glaurunging people to think that to the Sue is magical without a shred of evidence to support that conclusion (She REALLY has being with the Moron Beam in this Suefic), followed by Harry saying, and I quote &quot; ... I mean, it probably explains why she her parents didn&#39;t want her. She may have had a rare accidental magic the day she was born ... She&#39;s probably a Muggleborn, like you are, and her parents didn&#39;t know what to do with her.&quot; SERIOUSLY!? Isn&#39;t it Canon that you have your first bit of accidental magic when you are what, six years old or so? <br><br>Then there is her terrible past: &quot; It all started with Georgiana. She was the first one here. She&#39;s been here since she was born. Her birth parents left her here the day she was born. Didn&#39;t want her. Didn&#39;t care for her...&quot; <br><br>&quot; We had countless parents ... come here. And not even one of them has considered Georgiana. They always pass her up and went for the next child. It&#39;s like she&#39;s not even here... &quot;     </p>

            <p>So, as some of you might know, I play <i>Dungeons and Dragons</i>, and until a few weeks ago, my gaming group met regularly for over six years.

            <p>&quot;Yeah, that&#39;s a Noldo. I, uh, I think he used to be an agent of some sort--I mean, a DOGA agent. He left or retired or something a little before I joined--something about dying and maybe coming back to life? I&#39;m not even sure anymore. And he&#39;s got some sort of connection to Feanor&#39;s second so--Galloping Griffins, he&#39;s missing a hand!&quot; Dawn clapped a hand over her mouth for a moment, desperately hoping that her voice hadn&#39;t carried. When there was no immediate death by Noldorin glare, she lowered her hand and continued in a voice that was just above a whisper. &quot;That can&#39;t be right, that&#39;s the same hand Maedhros lost. He shouldn&#39;t be missing a hand at all--he looks like Maglor! What is he, a recruited mix of Maglor and Maedhros? Maybe he&#39;s a Maglor who got Maedhros&#39; backstory?

        <div class="post-body">
            <p>Would anyone be up for a body switch event set in HQ? I originally wanted to do one way back in 2008, but the Macrovirus crisis ended up taking the timeslot. Basically, if enough are up for it, (since this would be an all-hands event) I&#39;d set up a spreadsheet for everyone volunteering for it to toss their characters in to offer for their body being swapped into by another character, and set up the RP on the other board. The RP would include a plot, besides the introductory freakout, with the following:<br><br>i. Couple agents bringing in a body-switching device from a badfic and then it going off in HQ and subsequently getting lost in the midst of the following chaos- if anyone would like to volunteer their agents for that, it&#39;s fair game, otherwise I&#39;ve got a pair I&#39;d be introducing through this.  Cue it going haywire and affecting a good deal (if not all) of HQ. Characters can of course be exempt for whatever reason you can think of if you don&#39;t want them involved with actually getting bodyswitched! (They were on a mission, their particular brand of paranoia means they decided an aluminium hat was a wonderful accessory and it actually worked, they were somehow not in range, bizarrely naturally resistant, and so on.)<br><br>ia. As previously mentioned: Chaos. Well, more than usual. <br><br>ii. Hunting down the device! Because most people would probably prefer to be back in their usual body, and don&#39;t want to think about this whole thing too hard because it&#39;s too weird even for the PPC. This can be split into smaller groups, and I&#39;ll even roll a die or flip a coin depending on how many people want to get involved in this as far as whomever finds it goes. <br><br>iii. DoSAT doing their thing and fixing the problem and restoring everything back to normal (for the PPC). Cue relief, for the most part.<br><br>Overall it&#39;d take place over HQ time of about five days, starting either Sunday or Monday if people are interested. Since this is an RP, as usual by board standards, <i>everyone</i> can take part even if they don&#39;t have permission (just keep in mind that an eye&#39;ll be kept out on you if you go overly wonky or too out of line!). Of course there&#39;ll be guidelines, like &#39;this is not an excuse to maim someone else&#39;s character&#39;s body without permission&#39;. <br><br>Feel free to ask questions if you&#39;ve got any.</p>

            <p>Can  I add an extra character? The character is Technician Shui-Hua Liu. She doesn&#39;t have a page yet, but here&#39;s the information that may be needed: She&#39;s a mixed race Waterbender, born in Republic City, and as such she has blue eyes. She has a rather pale skin and her back-long hair used to be black, but she dyed it blonde, and keeps it in a tight braid. She&#39;s nearsighted and needs glasses. And she&#39;s in charge of the maintenance and operation of the Danger Room.<br><br>Abnd now, the extra details. Whoever gets into Solvig&#39;s body, won&#39;t get to use her powers, thanks to the Output Limiter; <u>unless</u> that person manages to convice Yuuna, or anyone else with the authority to deactivate it, or gets body swapped with Solvig while she is in the Danger Room, in which case, that person will be rather forced to interact with whoever gets into Shui-Hua&#39;s body, and quite likely will damage the Danger Room.<br><br>My other characters are left out of this, I have other plans for them.</p>

            <p>Yes,  you can add extra characters. As many as you like (within reason). <br><br>As for Solvig, that is something to discuss with whoever writes whoever gets her body!

            <p>Hi Des! I actually still check the Board most days but I have this terrible habit of lurking. Things are going well here - I&#39;m working on a large project, which is why my missions dried up. However, I thought this RP would be the perfect opportunity to clear a few cobwebs out of my agents&#39; RC (before Eagrus catches spiders moving into his armour)!<br><br>Also awww, cute little dragon!

            <p>Like, you grab another person and their agent and your agent co-writes their body-swap story? Because that would be kind of cool.<br><br>Or it could be used to do a Freaky-Friday style thing to have a pair of agents understand each other better.<br><br>It doesn&#39;t have to affect all or most of HQ. Don&#39;t see why it would; HQ&#39;s a big place. More of a &quot;Anybody who wants their agent involved should join in&quot;.<br><br>But we would need some people with DoSAT agents who can write up the &quot;Find the thing and get it deactivated&quot; plot.</p>

            <p>You volunteer your agents on the spreadsheet if you want them involved with the body swap but don&#39;t have a super specific preference. Once there&#39;s enough, I&#39;ll be applying randomized results.<br><br>That&#39;s pretty much what I meant. It&#39;s an opt-in by default, since I don&#39;t like people feeling like they have to be forced in. It&#39;s basically a &quot;if they&#39;re in HQ you are more than welcome to have them affected if you want&quot; sort of deal. I specified HQ as more being the limit of where it would happen, rather than it being able to happen to agents in the field at the time. <br><br>If people have DoSAT agents they want to volunteer for that part- and several people do!- we can go that route. There is also always Makes-Things.</p>

            <p>I probably ought to explain this thread a little bit, so here it goes.<br><br>I was working on my agents last night, and decided I didn&#39;t like them as much as I thought I did, because they didn&#39;t lend themselves to comedic purposes very easily. And since comedy and fun are kind of the point, I decided to go a whole new direction with my agents.<br><br>I decided I would create a sort of &quot;losers&#39; squad&quot; with my agents, meaning that in one way or another, they always mess up on their missions (even though they nearly always manage to kill their targets). <br><br>Once I started trying it from that angle, all kinds of comedic material opened up for me. My &quot;practice missions,&quot; or my &quot;test runs&quot; with my Claimed Badfics, turned out great and I could easily tell different stories with multiple permutations (I sounding smart!). <br><br>But I want to do some research. I&#39;m unsure if I can phrase this question in a way that doesn&#39;t offend anyone, but I will try anyway. <br><br>&quot;Can anyone point me in the direction of agents who are challenged by irregular problems, even for PPC agents?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Are there any agents who had to deal with significantly more than everyone else on a regular basis?&quot;<br><br>Or something like that. If I&#39;m being unclear, please let me know, and I&#39;ll try to explain better. If I offended anyone, I apologize in advance, but the question I had to ask didn&#39;t give me much to work with.<br><br>Semper erit insanus</p>

            <p>I&#39;m getting a gut feeling you&#39;re focusing on the wrong things in your writing. Yes, missions are inherently comedic, at least most of the time... but from what you just described, it feels like you&#39;re trying to force that humor with a gimmick. Don&#39;t focus on having your agents be &quot;funny&quot;, focus on them being well-rounded and suited to a story. Think of them like actual people, not a medium of hilarity. Make a a good character, and let the badfic bring the humor.</p>

            <p>As a general rule, most characters have something they&#39;re good at and something they struggle with.  While too much of the former is the most obvious cause of Sueishness, too much of the latter can also be bad for a character.  If your characters manage to succeed at difficult tasks despite lacking any sort of skill or aptitude, it make readers wonder why exactly they somehow manage it.  You could end up running into deus ex machina territory, or even Anti-Sues.<br><br>I&#39;d suggest just poking around the wiki and trying to find an agent that&#39;s a good example of what you&#39;re looking for.</p>

            <p>Everyone. Sort of. A bit.<br><br>See, it&#39;s no fun at all to have agents who are super duper good at their jobs - that way Suvianism lies. Instead, think about the <i>people</i> they are, think about <i>who</i> they are, and how <i>that</i> would help or hinder them in the field.<br><br>I kind of took this approach when designing my first Agent, Wobbles the Clown. She&#39;s a clown. Clowns are large and loud and brightly coloured, at least kids&#39; clowns are anyway. This is distinctly suboptimal for covert operations. But wait - we have disguise generators for that sort of thing! Hm. Make them not work. How? Say, didn&#39;t Harry Dresden have this thing where he made tech go boom by moving close to it? How would this inform someone&#39;s character? Would that be a disability? How would she work, what would she be doing, why is she here at all...<br><br>And so on from there.<br><br>Of course, her partner&#39;s more renowned around these parts anyway, but her disability is that she&#39;s an incorrigible git. So there&#39;s that. =]</p>

            <p>So I was digging through chatlogs from last year and found some number crunching I&#39;d done for fun and meant to post but never got around to doing so, so here it is.<br><br>The common refrain is that agents are horrendously overworked. To be sure, this is an incredibly demanding job, and in the middle of a badfic explosion it must feel like the missions have no end to them, but is it really as bad as some stories have made it out to be? For sure, we see a lot of stories about agents on their off time nowadays, which implies things have slowed down a good bit from the days Jay and Acacia were swinging swords at all things glittery, but I was curious and decided to test things out with a basic model I drew up. This is by no means totally comprehensive, there&#39;s too much missing data and too many variables for that, but there is enough here that the results are pretty interesting, I think.<br><br>Bob and Alice are two agents in a Generic Action Department, we could assume they&#39;re in DMS LOTR Division or Department of Floaters I suppose because of the specific category I&#39;m drawing on for example numbers. Let&#39;s assume Bob and Alice get three missions a day, every day, in one year of working for the PPC; I consider three missions daily to be a minimum marker for &quot;overworked&quot;/a generally stressful workload, mostly because I personally don&#39;t consider much less than this to be all that great a workload - I&#39;m sure some would disagree, it could be argued that even one a day is a very high workload considering the incredibly demanding and time consuming nature of a PPC mission. I will be including alternate calculations for one-mission-a-day. Three missions also seems to me to be as many as an agent pair would be able to take on in a day while still allowing them to meet sapient needs for food, rest, social time, and the like - that would be, say, one mission in the morning, one in the afternoon, and one in the evening, or all in one block at one time of the day, depending on when they arrive. <br><br>So we have our agents, and our rough workload. Bob and Alice kill three fics a day, every day, for a year, tallying 1095 missions performed by the end of the year; the Lord of the Rings section on fanfiction.net has 54,000 fics in it, most of which were probably written in the great fanfic boom of 2001-2004. At this workload, it would take Bob and Alice 49.32 or so years to kill every fic in LOTR, and even longer if you merge the Hobbit (11K) and Silmarillion (4.7K) sections with LOTR under a general &quot;Tolkienverse&quot; banner, at which point you&#39;re looking at 69.7K fics ahead of our heroes.<br><br>However, Bob and Alice would not be the only agent team in their department. This is where the second part of my model comes in: the fourth largest Action Department, DAVD, has at least 50 agents. Ignoring questions of why so many other Action Departments have fewer than 50, this seems like a good benchmark because not only is it a large number of agent teams all working at once, but the three most prominent Action Departments - Floaters, DMS, and Bad Slash - are implicitly or explicitly much larger. It&#39;s implied in several places that many thousands of agents work for the PPC after all, and depending on how literally you take a speech made by the SO in Reorg (&quot;If any Guards are listening, I urge you to heed my words. You may think yourselves a match for any Assassins, and that may be true, but the DMS outnumbers you ten, a hundred to one.&quot;) the DMS might have had up to 40,000 agents in 1999 (the DIS, when they became the Black Cats, had about 350-400 members, this including outside recruits, and the formation of the Black Cats is after they retreated from HQ having taken, in Nendil&#39;s words, unsustainable casualties in the fighting against the PPC; this means their effective strength immediately before the civil war must have been above 350 Guards, and 350 * 100 = 35,000), though this would be modified by taking into account agents who have since died, changed departments, left the PPC, and the like. I doubt in the span of 1999-2015 the DMS&#39; numbers have dropped from, say, 40,000 to 400 though. Thus, 50 agents is, for the Big Three that would be getting most of the missions, most likely a very small percentage of their effective strength, and at any given point they are very likely to have at least 50 agents able to perform missions. <br><br>Most agent teams consist of two agents, so 50 agents is 25 teams. Let&#39;s give Bob and Alice&#39;s 48 coworkers the exact same workload, three daily missions all year. 25 * (365 * 3) comes out to 27,375 fics killed. At this workrate, the Generic Action Division would wipe out the entire LOTR section of the Pit in about two years, and if you include the entire Tolkienverse (6.7K fics) as one category, they will take about two and a half years to wipe out all three sections. At this workrate, they would have cleansed the entire Hobbit section of the Pit before the badfic explosion was even finished. Now, let&#39;s take into account that not every single fic would be considered worth a mission by Upstairs - some wouldn&#39;t be damaging enough to canon, and some would be outright good. In this hypothetical, if we take LOTR and say half of its entries in the Pit are deemed not in need of a mission, that&#39;s 27,000 fics up for killing, all of which would be dead in this first hypothetical year. <br><br>Now, that&#39;s a very harsh year, but it&#39;s a period of &quot;argh, agents are so overworked&quot; that would be over quite quickly, especially when you consider there are much more than 50 agents out there and these missionable fics would be being distributed all over the place, rather than staying in one specific department. If we take into account there being more than 50, let&#39;s say 100 agents, these 50 agent pairs with the same workload as before have killed 54,750 fics in the first year. If we go even higher, let&#39;s say 2000 agents, 1000 agent pairs have killed 1,095,000 fics in one year (hey, they&#39;re millionaires!). Needless to say huge swathes of the Pit, including the entire Tolkienverse many times over, have been gutted by such a ravenous onslaught, and I would dare say most of the non-Pit sites have taken a beating too. Even at the height of the 2001-2004 badfic boom, I doubt there were a million fics in <i>any</i> continuum to kill. <br><br>Because I said I would, here is how these numbers come out for just one mission a day:<br><br>Bob and Alice: 365 (duh)<br>50 agents: 18,250 (this would take about 3.82 years to wipe out the collective Tolkienverse section on the Pit)<br>100 agents: 365,000 (duh again)<br>2000 agents: 730,000<br><br>Obviously, far fewer fics than three missions a day are being killed, but that&#39;s more than enough to wipe out most sections in short order. It&#39;s still quite a heavy workload, too, but again, not one that would last a long enough time for the badfic supply to be sustainable. In a major badfic boom, maybe fics are coming in faster than they&#39;re being killed, but booms end, and then the remaining fics are still there to be killed off. When even a somewhat modestly sized department of 50 agents can wipe out a whole fandom&#39;s badfic in a year&#39;s work, can we really say agents are still overworked? At any workrate that would qualify for the term, the question seems to be just how there&#39;s any badfic <i>left</i> to kill, especially since it&#39;s taken as a given that the missions we see agents do on page aren&#39;t the only ones they do; it would be patently absurd to suggest only a couple teams have ever done 50 missions in universe, for example. <br><br><b>BUT EKYL...</b><br><br>I know, this is a simplistic model that leaves several variables out, either due to lack of data or just to avoid this whole thing becoming an incomprehensible mess (read: for my own sanity&#39;s sake). Let&#39;s run down a few of them:<br><br>A lot more places than the Pit post fanfic: There&#39;s adultfanfiction.net, AO3, Quotev, people&#39;s blogs, independent sites, forums, etc. etc. etc. - however, this model uses the Pit because it&#39;s the easiest to get data from, AND by far the most popular: the majority of fanfics for a given canon are almost certainly going to be posted on FFnet, even though AO3 is picking up a lot of steam in recent years. If you add on the fanfics in these places, yes, there&#39;s a lot more on the pile, but the agents are still killing a huge number of fics yearly, and when you take my point above that not all fics posted will be deemed killable, the numbers will be dwindling fast.<br><br>Authors will keep writing fanfic/badfic: Yes, true, but how many? At what rate? To sustain a workrate like in this model, fics would have to be written and updated faster than the agents could kill them, and fandom momentum doesn&#39;t sustain that kind of pace for long. The LOTR and Hobbit booms lasted for years but eventually petered out; people still write fics for them, and for Harry Potter, but at nowhere near the rate they used to. Factor in the time it takes for Intel to find fics and determine if they need killing, then to send them to an agent team, and this would see the PPC workload start to slow down immensely. <br><br>Your data is full of assumptions!: By necessity, unfortunately. There&#39;s a lot of stuff here where gathering conclusive data would either be impossible (there&#39;s no way to say for sure exactly how many people are supposed to be in each department, in-universe, for example, just that the PPC as an organisation is much, much larger than the people actively writing characters in it), or more trouble than it&#39;s worth. As such, I put together a reasonably plausible hypothetical and fed data I could get into it to make a point. <br><br>Not every agent would get this many missions: Of course not, though I&#39;d say if you don&#39;t even get one mission a day you&#39;re not that overworked. But anyway, there are agents who wouldn&#39;t get this many missions daily, who wouldn&#39;t complete them quickly enough to stay on top of the pile (or at all, deaths/accidents/failures/snappings-in-actions do happen) or would be unavailable, but the key is that <i>enough</i> agents would be doing these missions to make this impact. If a department has 1000 agents and this workrate, 5% of its effective strength would be killing 27,375/18,250 fics a year. PPC work is demanding enough and dangerous enough that this would easily count as overworking agents, but for how long? <br><br>What about missions that take more than one day: This is tricky, and I&#39;m not sure I have an answer for it now - there&#39;s not really much in the way of data to figure on how in fic time relates to out of fic time, or how long your average agent spends on a mission. There&#39;ve been people who&#39;ve vanished for years doing missions, people who&#39;ve been in mission for a long while then come back at the end and it&#39;s the same day as when they left, and in between; I remember something about Jay saying she&#39;d spent years in missions but came back to HQ not having aged and finding time not having passed, or something like that. It does seem that time outside the Word Worlds moves more slowly than inside, so I consider it possible at least a minority of agents would be able to do three missions in an HST day, although to them it might feel like more or less than that period of time.<br><br>What about reposts: In cases where a fic is reposted, or posted in multiple places... I&#39;m honestly not sure, but I think there might be precedent for this. My personal theory is it stays dead; whatever problem the agents go in to fix serves as the sort of anchor of the author&#39;s influence, and with it dead the word world sort of collapses and/or becomes inaccessible - so the text would still exist but it would be unable to affect the canon any more. This is why fics killed by agents don&#39;t just get deleted, by my estimate. It&#39;s midnight now as I type this so I might not be explaining very well.<br><br>In the PPC multiverse, wouldn&#39;t fics come from more places than just World One: This is actually my (super meta) preferred explanation - surely the LMSF and other Sue-creating organisations make badfic happen too, plus there&#39;s how many alternate Earths out there in this setting? Plus canons that have fictions that people would write fanfic about? A simultaneous fanfic boom from two Earths could produce a terrifying amount of badfic if timing ended up working out. Given what we just calculated for a small percentage of the largest departments, the PPC could handle this, but I could see them getting swamped if there&#39;s enough of it out there. Still, overwork would be a temporary situation, I&#39;d think, because they&#39;d be chewing through fics at an alarming rate given how many more agents there supposedly are than I have included in this model. It could well be that things are slowing down in-universe, though, possibly in response to how much fic has already been killed - the Flowers probably don&#39;t want all their agents to suddenly be out of a job.<br><br>I&#39;m tired now and starting to lose track of all my points, I believe I had more but this is probably good for now. I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll remember more tomorrow and over the weekend in general, but I thought this would be interesting stuff for the Board to chew on! It certainly does give some food for thought.<br><br>...Now I sorta wonder what the PPC would do if one day they ran out of badfic to kill. Which, in an entropic multiverse, I suppose they inevitably will one day. It could maybe be good material for an AU or &quot;the day the consoles stopped beeping&quot; short story.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m in the navy, which is not news to most people these days. Currently I work in deck. There can be made very many not-so-suspicious parallels!<br><br>We do a lot of work and don&#39;t really get extended time off, especially compared to other certain departments (I&#39;m looking at those berks in the personnel office) but it&#39;s not quite as bad as others (engineers, those poor buggers). <br><br>Now, on an underway, there is no way to leave the ship (obviously). You are always On Duty. There are different working hours, as well! <br><br>For example, me? Normal work starts at seven thirty usually. We work until ten thirty am (to go and wait in line for an hour to eat). We get our food and hope it isn&#39;t too alive and that there&#39;s ice in the ice machine and that there is hot sauce to hide the sometimes questionable taste.  I have seen people put hot sauce on things you would normally not put hot sauce on out of sheer desperation.  After eating you hole up somewhere to nap until one PM and then go back to work again until four PM when you go back to the ever present food line and end up putting hot sauce on hot sauce covered chicken. And then you go back to work again for an hour or two after that, so the normal working day ends between seven and eight PM. <br><br>That is not including watch, which is three to five hours of watch which is in shifts that could be during normal working hours to being after or before. When you are not actively working with the department you are usually trying to either catch up on something you were supposed to be working on to get qualified on it or trying to desperately catch up on sleep and not murder the master at arms or legal person who is talking loudly right next to your bed. <br><br>We get the occasional Sunday morning off. Unless you have watch that morning in which case you don&#39;t get a Sunday morning off at all.<br><br>Sometimes we have to wake up at four, even three in the morning to do things that will last the rest of the day anyways, we&#39;re just staring early. <br><br>As you can see this is a lot of time spent working and not very much time for anything else, and maybe overall one night&#39;s full rest every four or five days give or take.<br><br>This is a sane schedule compared to the engineers who are on a five and dime. (Which is I can&#39;t remember the order but I&#39;m pretty sure is five off, ten on.) <br><br>We still goof off, go to the gym, screw around in random spaces, play games, and do things. Like karaoke with the marines. Or fish off the aft end of the ship. Lack of sleep be damned.<br><br>This is not an existence where &quot;days&quot; are a thing, much less &quot;days off&quot;. Everything is hours. <br><br>Common issues cited with the navy is personnel not getting enough sleep, working too much with not enough people, poor retention causing people to leave and never look back and a lack of trust in the leadership.  <br><br>(Sounds familiar no?)<br><br>...anyway, I lost my point a bit. But yes, you can be hideously overworked, sleep deprived,  and hoping your food still isn&#39;t alive and still be able to do things by forcibly making time some way or another. </p>

            <p>Or at least, ridden with different assumptions...<br><br>FF.net gets ~60 fics an hour (that is, the &#39;Just In&#39; page lists 60 items with under one hour since posting. It&#39;s ~40 at 9am UK, rising to ~50 by 3pm; I&#39;m assuming but haven&#39;t checked that it will top 60 when America gets online properly.)<br><br>ASSUME the &#39;good&#39;s in that are balanced out by the &#39;bad&#39;s from other sites.<br><br>That means each week sees (60*24*7) = 10,080 new badfics.<br><br>A mission takes ~ 1 day, internally. Some are shorter, some span multiple days.<br><br>ASSUME that mission-time and HQ-time are roughly synchronised.<br><br>Agents get ~3 hours between missions. Sometimes longer (Medical visits), sometimes the next mission follows immediately. This is basically the time it takes to write a report. Some agents manage to snatch a little sleep.<br><br>Agents seem to have a day&#39;s-worth of down-time every 4-10 missions, depending on the writer. Let&#39;s call it one day a week.<br><br>In one week, an agent can therefore deal with (24*6)/(24+3) = 5 stories<br><br>To <b>keep pace with the influx</b>, the PPC requires (10080 / 5) = 2016 Action teams, thus <b>4032 Action agents</b>.<br><br>If agents are assumed to work five days and have two off, they can only handle 4 stories per week, and the number rises to <b>5040 Action agents</b>.<br><br>To keep pace with the influx, the Department of Intelligence needs to handle 60 fics per hour. An hour seems like a reasonable average time to work through a fic - some require a personal visit and take longer, others are short and take less - so that implies 60 Spies in the Sorting Room per shift. Per (Un)Intelligence, there are six teams, which don&#39;t seem to work simultaneously, implying 360 Sorting Room Spies. The number of Action Spies is much lower: assuming only one fic an hour gets bumped up to them, and allowing six hours for a mission + report, they may only need six! To allow for sleep, assume ten, giving a total of <b>370 Spies</b>.<br><br>hS<br><br>PS: Coming later - comparisons between the two mathsings, including a look at that 60-per-hour figure, and the 50-in-DAVD-fourth-largest one. ~hS</p>

            <p>After that huge post I just made, I plugged your agent numbers for agents needed for 5 and 4 missions weekly, and that many agents doing that much work (2016 * 5 * 52 and 2520 * 4 * 52 [or 5040/2(4*52)) for a year seems to come out to 524,160 fics killed in that year. Still more than enough to wipe out entire fandoms if it&#39;s a slow year. It sounds like enough fics are coming in daily to keep things going, but even the biggest categories on the Pit could get chewed up within a few years if there&#39;s more agents working than the bare minimum suggested number for keeping up.</p>

            <p>I checked out your 60 an hour estimate for fics posted, too, although you said that&#39;s high. 60 * 24 * 365 = 525,600 fics posted to the Pit a year, and that&#39;s presumably fics for more than one continuum. While that&#39;s 1440 fics escaping missions at year&#39;s end if we assume every one of those fics gets targetted, more than the bare minimum number of agents - and we&#39;ve already covered that I think there are more Action agents than you say - and we quickly reach a point where more fics are being killed in a year than are actually being posted.<br><br>Though at that point, of course, we have to factor in all the non-Pit sources of badfic.</p>

            <p>It does cover some blank spots I feel I was leaving, and you have data I either couldn&#39;t get or didn&#39;t think to get. And this is why when you post these things you hope an actual scientist comes by to poke at it. :P I genuinely didn&#39;t think to check how many fics per hour appear on FF.net, or maybe I just didn&#39;t get around to it; I just took the numbers as they currently existed and went &quot;okay, so assume these agents are tackling X number of these fics during an &#39;all hands on deck, constant missions&#39; footing, how many would they chew through assuming what I would personally consider a truly huge workload.&quot; I&#39;d be run ragged if I had to kill three badfics a day! That&#39;s a ballpark figure I took as sort of going &quot;what might a PPC workload look like at its heaviest.&quot;<br><br>4-5 missions a week is still a lot, maybe more than some could handle, and does sound like a heavy enough workload to cause some of the issue we&#39;ve seen in fanfic explosions. However, the question would be if it&#39;s truly the extreme workload that seems to be implied in old missions. Not to trivialise the work a PPC agent has to do, but at this pace it basically turns into a slightly longer, much much more dangerous version of the standard work week. Which I guess fits right in with the workplace humour. I do think 1000-10,000 action agents (I&#39;m replying to both of your posts in this one to save time) figure might be lowballing it a little, but it does work as a good &quot;let&#39;s assume there are at least this many agents out there killing fics, to keep up with how many are posted daily&quot; figure. I suppose it depends, in part, on if you figure that&#39;s a number per action department, or for EVERY action department; 10,000 agents is still a lot of people, but I dunno. <br><br>To get back to actual numbers, I would say 4-5 a week would possibly work as a ballpark estimate for the average number of missions tackled by an agent team (some people get more, some people get less, and when there&#39;s a huge fanfic boom everyone&#39;s doing everything as fast as they can possibly do &#39;em) considering the general &quot;things have slowed down a bit&quot; vibe I get from recent stuff and that there&#39;s still a lot of fic out there to kill. Though I still think a look at a PPC that realises there&#39;s no fanfic left to kill would be interesting one day, and it does seem to me that they&#39;re capable of taking out a truly immense amount of fics when they have to. Of course, 208/260 missions a year per team feels much more reasonable than tens of thousands of missions like if agents are getting multiple missions daily. I do think the difference in these figures actually suggests, especially since I personally prefer the four-a-week-with-two-days-or-so-off model for the modern, &quot;nothing is currently exploding&quot; PPC, that the agents could have it much much worse than they do. <br><br>On DAVD: Yes, I&#39;d remembered before going to bed that a discussion about their numbers happened years ago and you had said pretty definitively that there obviously weren&#39;t still only 50 agents when they became the fourth largest Action Department. I used 50 as a marker because a) it&#39;s a rare department where we have an actual number for how many of them there are in-universe, so I didn&#39;t have to pull a number completely from my hat, and b) we can then point to it and say there are 50 people here going into the Word Worlds and killing badfic on a regular basis. 50, in the original post, was my minimum &quot;we can assume a given action department, at least among the major departments, will have at least 50 agents available for missions at any given point in time.&quot; I do think it&#39;s odd that a major department like DIC would have less people in it than DAVD, say, but Floaters has probably taken a lot of workload from departments like DIC and APD. I imagine there&#39;s a lot of departments that only still exist to give the Department Head a job.<br><br>This data and the conclusions you come to also support a thought I&#39;ve always had, namely that there&#39;s probably many more agents in the infrastructure and support departments (think Intel, Finance, Personnel, Operations, DIA...) than Action. This makes perfect sense, because the logistical needs of this place are immense; in every army, 9/10 or so of the soldiers are working behind the lines. This would do something for addressing the huge implicit numbers of agents without completely stripping the Worlds bare, though some of the Action Departments are probably big enough to be doing a real number on what&#39;s out there.<br><br>Admittedly, our two models rely on some different assumptions that could make the resultant data go wildly off course. How does mission time <i>really</i> relate to HQ time? How many missions really come down in what an agent might recognise as a 24 hour period? What&#39;s the difference between an agent&#39;s perceived time and the time that actually passes? Yours says mission time matches up more or less with HQ time and each mission takes about a day as a ballpark guess, mine says missions seem to vary and not everyone seems to experience the same amount of time in mission as passes outside the Word World. Admittedly, yours gets pretty specific, whereas mine basically goes, &quot;let&#39;s assume it&#39;s possible for at least some agent teams to get multiple missions within one HST day and complete them all, and see how many they&#39;d chew through in a year if this happened every day&quot;.<br><br>I think we can say that given what&#39;s suggested from both our models, there&#39;s definitely enough missions going on within a short enough timeframe for your average agent to <i>feel</i> overworked and like there&#39;s no end in sight, and whether or not they truly are that put upon is a matter of interpretation. It does seem like things are better now than they were in Jay and Acacia&#39;s day, where I bet Intel really couldn&#39;t keep up because so many people were posting so many things at once - it would explain current missions being posted using old fics, if that&#39;s backlog being cleared because Intel finally got to that fic, although in universe the 2001-2003 fics are almost all surely dead by now. It could definitely vary between department, division, and individual agent; there&#39;s probably busy areas, and divisions for fandoms that&#39;re extremely quiet because there&#39;s hardly ever fics worth killing any more, plus my assumption that maybe more fics are being written in-universe than we see here. A DMS Tolkienverse or Harry Potter agent team is probably busier than, say, the entire APD Mossflower Division or DMFF, especially from 2001-2004 and 2011-2014 (creeping into 2015 because there&#39;s still a lot of Hobbit fic being written - there weren&#39;t 11,000 fics in the Hobbit section this time last year). Floaters, the poor sods, probably get the most work due to having the most agents and the least specialisation. This would allow for what you said, that there&#39;s room for things to shuffle around either way - while your typical agent probably feels overworked, and really does see quite a lot of missions, I doubt things are quite so bad as, say, never having any time to relax or recover. For one, we see a lot of stories lately that have them doing exactly that; would Rudi&#39;s or the Pennacook Club or A Troupe By Any Other Name or the businesses in New Caledonia or the Multiverse Monitor exist if nobody ever had time to run the show or be a patron? <br><br>(That does raise a question though: what does a badfic do when nobody&#39;s killing it? I seem to recall reading somewhere it just sorta loops over and over until someone shows up to deal with it but does it hurt the canon worse? Is there any particular effect if an author finishes their fic before the PPC gets to it? These are outside the scope of this model and discussion, but something to ponder.)<br><br>For their purposes, though, I think both calculations are serviceable - namely, to allow for this discussion and to look at what it might actually look like to be an agent. How busy is the PPC, really? What kind of progress are they actually making? Maybe more than we thought, or less, depending on which data you like better, and either set of numbers shows how daunting a task is ahead of someone who takes this job. With so many badfics to face, no wonder turnover can be pretty high. I guess in the end it&#39;s sort of the Batman situation. Batman has cleaned up the streets of Gotham considerably, by now, in many interpretations, but there&#39;s always going to be crime, and his rogues gallery will always be out there causing mayhem, because as long as people want to write and read Batman stories there has to be a villain for him to face.</p>

            <p>60 stories per hour may be a bit high. Right now I count 33, so perhaps the 40 was closer to representative than I thought.<br><br>More interestingly, FF.net splits its New Stories by Stories and Crossovers. That 33 is 30 stories, 3 crossovers; that means that, to keep pace, roughly 10% of PPC Action agents must be either Implausible Crossovers, Floaters on Crossover duty, or dealing with crossovers as a secondary charge.<br><br>Now: DAVD. DAVD had only a handful of (Action) agents left in 2006. By 2009, they were back to 49 Action agents, and ~66 total.

            <p>Multiple missions a day might seem to be feasible from an outside perspective, but a lot of missions seem to last multiple days.  Even in TOS, Jay and Acacia frequently have to make camp or find somewhere to sleep.  Now, given that the PPC&#39;s temporal mechanics are... complicated, a mission could theoretically only take about two or three hours of Headquarters time (HQT) but several days of Agent time (AT).  Heck, a mission could theoretically take <i>no</i> time, with the agents returning only a few seconds of HQT later than when they left, but with a cumulative AT of a week.  With that kind of system, it&#39;s easy to feel overworked even if you only get a mission every other day.<br><br>In general, I imagine most PPC agents, rather than the typical nine-to-five pattern, tend to work extremely long &quot;shifts&quot; with relatively neglible time off between them.  It might not look like much from an outside perspective, but most of them put in far more than 40 man-hours of work a week, at least in terms of AT.  </p>

            <p>Admittedly, &quot;there&#39;s no way to tell how time spent in mission relates to time passed outside the mission, but I assume at least some agents can do multiple missions in a day&quot; might seem like a bit of copout? But you&#39;re saying I didn&#39;t talk about something that I, you know, did.</p>

            <p>I suppose you did talk about it in brief, but still.  You predicated the entire definition of how hard they worked by assuming that a mission is a reasonable thing to do multiple of in a day, and I thought the idea that it wasn&#39;t was a topic worthy of further discussion.<br><br>Also, my reply wasn&#39;t meant to be harsh or dismissive or anything, I was just continuing the discussion.</p>

            <p>There&#39;s more to &#39;overworked&#39; than workload. The agents get no breaks (Ironic Overpower, anybody?), the food is bad (hello, Slorp), and missions are, for the most part, very stressful; I think those factors all contribute to the feeling of overworked-ness, as they all serve to make an agent feel that they don&#39;t have time to breath.<br></p>

            <p>Namely, this was me taking a ballpark figure for how many missions might be coming in to create the feeling of constant work with no breaks ever. Especially when you consider that there&#39;s only so much a pair can do before they&#39;ve just been run into the ground by the workload. <br><br>And don&#39;t get me started on Slorp, that took maybe half an hour to get thoroughly run into the ground. :P<br><br>I will admit that I personally assume things have gotten better/slowed down a bit in HQ compared to the Great Fanfic Explosion, but then, Tolkienverse agents will have only recently finished riding out the smaller fanfic boom (&quot;only&quot; 11,000 fics at the time of this writing) caused by the Hobbit movies. This also isn&#39;t something pulled out of my hat randomly, but going off the vibe I get in a lot of stories lately - the &quot;oh [diety of your choice], we literally never get any breaks ever and everything is horrible and somehow I haven&#39;t died from starvation or sleep deprivation&quot; seems to have fallen aside, especially since there&#39;s a lot of alternatives to the Cafeteria these days. We see enough stories of agents just hanging out and doing their thing, or at least not being completely buried in missions 24/7, that it seems to indicate the old status quo is no longer, well, quo.</p>

            <p>They&#39;ve come up in passing before, and I think general opinion is that they&#39;re not exactly our jurisdiction.  We don&#39;t really do fan comics in general, and frankly, Sonichu is only fan anything by the very skin of its teeth.  That, combined with just how entwined it is with the life of its creator and the sheer level of badness it entails, means that we&#39;re unlikely to touch it at any point.  Plus, it&#39;s already been thoroughly torn to pieces by a number of sources, I don&#39;t know that we need to do it, too.</p>

            <p>Dibs on the MH one! I remember reading that one back in the day; it actually could have been pretty good if Lily and James hadn&#39;t survived for no reason whatsoever. Carnage would be familiar enough with the monsters, and I&#39;d say he&#39;d be pretty happy with that baby Hypnocatrice.</p>

            <p>The worst part of the &quot;cosplayer becomes their character for real&quot; trend is that I don&#39;t automatically hate it.  You could get a lot of good identity issues out of it, as the main character finds themselves trapped in a body that they know isn&#39;t theirs but still is, maybe dealing with instincts and memories that are simultaneously foreign and natural to them.  But instead of actually doing anything with that premise, it&#39;s just poorly integrated into a MLP fic and used as an excuse for Stu powers.<br><br>And that last one... ugh.  I really cannot stand the trend of bronies (or other fans of children&#39;s series, I suppose, but I see it the most with bronies) glorying in darkening and corrupting an innocent continuum.  All I can think is, <i>why</i>?  Nobody&#39;s making you like MLP.  You could always take part in some darker, more mature fandom if that&#39;s what you want.  Like it or not, MLP is a kid&#39;s show, and I don&#39;t understand why the so-called fans can&#39;t respect that.</p>

            <p>Elsa being melded with Grey is horrifying enough, especially considering the author&#39;s managed to capture some of Hellspawn&#39;s personality (I know this canon via the Das Sporking LJ, hence the... nickname), but I went in thinking that Anna Steele was, well, *Ana* Steele. As in, crossover, not creepy, creepy fusion. I&#39;m out. No sense in scarring myself and my agents that badly.<br><br>I can, however, tell you that this is absolutely horrible and all of my nope. Elsa alone is awful. &quot;I WEAR SUITS&quot; (more silly than horrible) and her *thought process* and good grief, even her father is OOC and that&#39;s just a flashback...<br><br>I will say one thing, which is that at least with this version of Grey I get some sense that she&#39;s gotten tired of the routine of her job instead of just plain whining and never doing much of anything. Some kudos to the author for that. Still creepy, and Elsa!Grey isn&#39;t much better than original Grey (who for the full name of Gaston Hellspawn Bedbug over at Das Sporking), but it&#39;s a very, very slight improvement.<br><br>But yeah, no, not taking this /shudders/ Not with that pairing. Which is fine by me--I don&#39;t want to know how OOC Anna will get. She&#39;s many things, but she is nowhere near the character of Ana Steele. Good luck to anyone who does take it, though.<br><br>~DF</p>

Suspicion and anticipation surrounding the unusual activity attributed to fabled artist and provocateur Banksy has reached a Willy Wonka-esque fervor. Well, if Banksy’s your bag, continue fervoring. If not, there’s more than a few reasons to continue reading.<br><br>&quot;The spectacle has since been revealed to be a pop-up art exhibition in the form of an apocalyptic theme park titled Dismaland (“The UK’s most disappointing new visitor attraction”) that will be open to the public for five weeks.<br><br>&quot;The event has all the hallmark details of a traditional Banksy event from its initial shroud of secrecy to artistic themes of apocalypse, anti-consumerism, and pointed social critiques on celebrity culture, immigration, and law enforcement. However, there’s one major deviation: the bulk of the artwork packed into three main interior galleries was created by dozens of other artists.<br><br>&quot;So just what’s hidden inside the walls of this derelict seaside resort? A demented assortment of bizarre and beautiful artworks from no less than 58 global artists including Damien Hirst, Jenny Holzer, Jimmy Cauty, Bill Barminski, Caitlin Cherry, Polly Morgan, Josh Keyes, Mike Ross, David Shrigley, Bäst, and Espo. Banksy is also showing 10 artworks of his own.<br><br>&quot;Dismaland features a cavalcade of artists featured here on Colossal over the last few years including pieces by Escif, Maskull Lasserre, Kate McDowell, Paco Pomet, Dietrich Wegner, Michael Beitz, Brock Davis, Ronit Baranga, and others.&quot;</i><br><br>I know this was posted more than a week ago, but I thought it would be worth sharing anyway.<br><br>Oh, and my brother&#39;s response when I showed this to him?<br><br><strike>ABANDONED BY DISNEY</strike><br><br><b>A̻͉̪̞̙̩B̼̭͖̩̺Á̺̤̺̮̣͉͕͎̱͝N͕̙͉͜͟͞D̳̻͔̻Ơ̯̦̥̫͈͠ͅN͏̠͎͚̣͇̜E̫̯̳̻̠̘̠ͅD̩̘̰̙́͞ ̛̳̙̯̫̰̜̙͝B̴̷̥̳̜̝͕̜̗͞Ỳ̵̼̗̤ͅ ̴̲̝̫̣̝̜̟̪ͅG̥̞̜͜O̶̴͎͉͎D҉̶̙̣̬̱͎͠ͅ</b></p>

            <p>If you have not read this story yet, I highly, highly recommend you read it. This is a story that could, and should, be read by everybody. Wonderfully chilling, beautifully crafted, and a buildup that make you long for more. While I was disappointed by the ending (which I will not spoil) it does not sour the experience one bit. In fact, the ending is rather good. Just... Not where I thought the story was going. I consider this not just the best SCP, but one of the best short stories I personally have read. Seriously, read it. All of you. You will not regret it.<br><br>The Nightclub one was interesting. I like how the Foundation has got the scripts down to a science, learning how to save the most people possible, even down to being able to save the vast majority most times. This is a great example of how to show through telling. The implications, the holes filled in the mind as to how, exactly, the Foundation learned these scripts so thoroughly. Very well crafted story.<br><br>Hanged King&#39;s Tragedy is a play that, were I a better playwright then I am, I would be tempted to take a swing at writing the &#39;original play.&#39; It definitely reads like a summary to a lost Shakespeare play. It took very clear inspiration from Macbeth, which while it does not have a singular figure haunting the play like this one, is infamous for being a cursed production seeped in blood. The juxtaposition between the bloody and deadly haunted production, and the grim humor of the written script makes the ghost all the more terrifying then the mere haunting would have by itself. While not as good for me as 93 or 453, it is still one of the better stories on the site.<br><br>Who doesn&#39;t love Josie? Not all SCPs have to kill you or end the world or something, they just have to be weird. Of the &quot;lighthearted SCP&#39;s&quot;, I&#39;m a fan of the <a href="http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-387">Box of Legos</a>. A box full of living Lego that just wants to build? What more do you want! So glad they let it just be cute for what it is. The ending was particularly good.</p>

            <p>This is really well written and well researched. I think it is important to raise awareness around representation of autism on all fronts, including fiction. Though I have not encountered them myself, I too have heard about the misrepresentation and steriotypes affecting autistic characters. <br><br>I think that maybe you could continue to delve into this issue by analysing both good and bad examples in depth to show what should and shouldn&#39;t be done. <br><br>For good examples in published fiction, I can offer Max Braverman from the TV series <a href="http://www.nbc.com/parenthood">Parenthood</a> and Hikaru Azuma from the manga <a href="http://www.yenpress.com/with-the-light/">With The Light</a> <br><br>On the fanfiction side of things, both Riko Tasogare from <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10288703/1/Twilight-Pretty-Cure">Twilight Pretty Cure</a> and Chika Senri from <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10057836/1/Puzzle-Hunt-Precure">Puzzle Hunt Precure</a> have been praised for providing good portrayals of neurodiverse characters.</p>

            <p>This is well-done! I think I&#39;ve known I was autistic for a  few years now (though good luck getting parents to believe that - when I was in middle school I had a test for that and autism was disqualified on the basis that I was capable of making jokes/conversation, which... ugh.) <br><br>The only thing I can think of that might be worth elaborating more on is the fact that being autistic and happy are not mutually exclusive (and not happy in the too-dumb-to-be-otherwise sense.) Because a lot of people seem to think that autism is a permanent misery for everyone involved, except when it&#39;s ~*INSPIRATIONAL*~. </p>

            <p>Story time: my first serious boyfriend was a sweet guy. He was shy, but he loved hanging out with his friends; we and a mutual buddy got together one Halloween to dress up in menacing robes and scare little kids. ^^; Lots of fun.<br><br>He was a very talented saxophone player, and a fan of the Beatles; he drove everyone in band crazy by constantly playing &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot; during individual warmups (though the one time he didn&#39;t, everyone freaked out, heh heh). He was a huge <i>Lord of the Rings</i> fan and an avid <i>Minecraft</i> player. He had two dogs that he loved, a little sister (who... actually ended up dating my little brother for a few months, that was cute. But weird. But also cute.), and very nice parents. <br><br>All in all, a pretty normal guy. He is also autistic, and I didn&#39;t find out until about a year and a half after we broke up. <br><br>My brother was also tested for autism and he narrowly avoided being diagnosed with Asberger&#39;s, and he later told me he cheated because he didn&#39;t want to be labeled a &#39;crazy&#39; like me. So it&#39;s very possible I have an autistic brother as well. Aside from liking to make hilariously inappropriate jokes at the worst possible times, he&#39;s also pretty normal. Very smart kid, straight As, lots and lots of Advanced Placement classes, plays tennis for the varsity team, and he&#39;s built himself a couple of robots as well. He loves to play <i>World of Warcraft</i> and <i>Minecraft</i>, and he has the D&amp;D fourth edition Monster Manual memorized. <br><br>You wouldn&#39;t look at this stuff and say &quot;Aha! Autistic!&quot; You&#39;d say &quot;Yeah, he&#39;s a geek.&quot;<br><br>My dad has a friend whose son (a few years older than me) is also autistic, and the only clue to people who don&#39;t know is that he sometimes has to get away from a loud party by going to a separate room. And considering I&#39;m the same way, albeit for different reasons, it&#39;s not a massive tip-off by itself.<br><br>Tl;dr, you can&#39;t always tell. :)</p>

            <p>You know how they talk about an &quot;autism epidemic&quot; and all that? Most of that is new diagnosis in mild cases, which beforehand would not have been diagnosed because the disability associated with it is mild and the individual usually only needs intermittent support. The other part of it is the decrease in intellectual disability (UK would call it &quot;learning disability&quot;) cases, which are increasingly being recognized as autism. So, increasing awareness has put autism in the public eye, and of course they will be writing about it.<br><br>I went undiagnosed until 23 years old, myself, though that was mostly because my mom (who as an occupational therapist had worked with autistic children) was so paranoid of having me &quot;labled&quot; that she took me out of school to avoid evaluations. That and because if I stayed in, sooner or later someone would believe me about what things were like at home. Let&#39;s just say I&#39;m glad to be on my own, hey? :)<br><br>The trouble with writing about autism is that we&#39;re just at the beginning of working specifically for autism rights/autism acceptance, and that much of the &quot;awareness&quot; out there is fear/pity hype. So you get a subject that a lot of people are thinking about, but about which there&#39;s not a lot of unembellished, everyday-life information. The result is skewed characterization and messed-up writing from authors who don&#39;t do their research.</p>

            <p>Is first figuring out where on the autistic spectrum they fall, and how it will affect their work. Taking the PPC as an example, someone severely autistic would be completely unsuitable for work in an action department, but might find a calling in one of the quieter bits of DoSAT or FicPsych. Whatever they want, really. Contrast someone who &quot;only&quot; has Asperger&#39;s Syndrome; it would be interesting to see how someone like that can function in an action department.<br><br>Of course, in a comedy setting, it&#39;s trickier - you don&#39;t want to make jokes about other people&#39;s suffering.</p>

            <p>The way action departments work is &quot;withstand the fic, read charges, kill the Sue/exorcise the canons/etc.,&quot; right?<br><br>So. Imagine that hypothetical Agent Dinah here is autistic. She has sensory problems, is nonverbal, and wouldn&#39;t be able to handle the stress of combat.<br><br>But she can still kill a Sue. She wears headphones and uses the Words as subtitles if she needs to, uses sign language to talk to her partner, and her partner reads the charges at the end before Dinah drops our little Sue into our volcano with her RA.

            <p>I mean, for one thing &#39;severely&#39; autistic is generally a useless measurement. Do you mean someone nonverbal? Because that really wouldn&#39;t interfere as long as their partner understood them. And they could be affected more by Sue phenomenons, but then there are a lot of Agents who have heightened senses that are bothered by that kind of thing.<br><br>Also, don&#39;t <i> most </i> Agents work in &#39;whatever they want&#39;?

            <p>I was writing the post while the link went up. I don&#39;t have the spoons to give any in-depth critique right now, but I enjoyed it immensely. While my own trouble with autistic-character-writing is &quot;oh gosh, I see none written well and I feel like I&#39;m relying on my own experience too much,&quot; it is *really* useful to see someone else put into words how I&#39;ve been feeling about how people write us.<br><br>Have you seen a site called &quot;Disability in Kid Lit?&quot; They&#39;ve done quite a bit on books with autistic characters, and have (IIRC) found a few that they thought were quite good. </p>

            <p>I have some little nitpicks...<br>First, Voyd, the Nyan Cat Song, is actually a sped up version of &quot;Nyanyanya!&quot; by Hatsune Miku, so it actually doesn&#39;t say &quot;Meowmeow...&quot;<br><br>And Skarm... I have some issues with the way Lapis speaks. Is she using fangirl japanese, or is she supposed to be a native Japanese speaker trying to speak English? Because, if it&#39;s the first one, that rubs me the wrong way, and if it&#39;s the second, is done wrongly and feels offensive. Take your pick.<br><br>And... which continuum was the host continuum? The Little Mermaid or Pirates?<br>Because if it was the former, guys... I have bad news for you.  Guys, you pretty much kidnapped Davy Jones, his crew and the kraken from their native continuum and plopped them into another without returning them home.<br><br>If it was the latter... well, I have bad news too. Guys, you also got a Geographical Aberration, as two non-canonical locations would have been plopped into the world of Pirates of the Caribbean, and you forgot to send back all the canons from The Little Mermaid, back to their Woooooorld~ (heheheh)<br><br>Aside from that, I found the Mission enjoyable and entertaining. <br><br>Also Voyd, there&#39;s something that Skarm and me have to speak with you, but that should better be left for G-Hangouts.</p>

            <p>I threw in the Japanese in the first draft because I always figured she was bilingual (what with the Pokemon anime being Japanese and then dubbed in English). However, I guess the Fangirl Japanese is probably a remnant of her Suvian origins and would&#39;ve been removed upon being de-glittered.<br><br>The host continuum was The Little Mermaid, so I edited it so that Davy Jones and co. sent back to their home world.<br><br><s>Also, petition to refer to Steph/Cupid as Squid Icarus, because why not?</s></p>

            <p>Interesting interaction between your characters, and even if the badfic was boring as all get-out, at least the mission was a page-turner, metaphorically speaking. I wonder what the future holds for Cupid and Stephanie.<br><br>Well, you literally asked for it, so here&#39;s what I caught:<br><br>1) <i>She closed her eyes and concentrated; in a flash of color, she suddenly looked like a deluxe-sized, female Cupid.</i><br>You make it seem as if she transformed into an angel instead of changing color. Try something like this:<br> She closed her eyes and concentrated; in a flash of color, she suddenly looked like a deluxe-sized, female Cupid, albeit wingless and with tentacles for legs.<br><br>2) <i>There you are, you had me so worried!</i><br>Technically ungrammatical (replace the comma with a semicolon), but it might work if you actually intended for Lapis to say her lines that quickly.<br><br>3) <i>I am in fact the first boss of the game, the Mantis Ant.</i><br>Is Chakkik supposed to be the selfsame character, or is he just the same <i>species</i> as the boss?<br><br>4) <i>Disguise-Outfitting Ryticular Costume System.</i><br>Ironically, you&#39;re misspelling something by using the correct spelling. &quot;Costume&quot; here is to be spelled with a &quot;K&quot;, not a &quot;C&quot;, hence the acronym D.O.R.K.S.<br><br>5) <i>blue dorsal/anal fins</i><br>Replace the comma with the word &quot;and.&quot;<br><br>6) <i>[Cupid] had large, flowing fins where his wings would be as an angel. Or, in this case, an angelfish.</i><br>I suggest that you delete the last sentence. I don&#39;t think that angefish have such fins. Besides, you already mentioned his dorsal (back) fin a few sentences earlier, so these fins would be in addition to that one.<br><br>7) <i>Taking out the (thankfully waterproof) RA, Cupid put a hand to his ear, delighted to realize that the sound of the Words travelled much further while underwater.</i><br>Huh? Unless I&#39;m mistaken, agents can only <i>see</i> the Words, and that by unfocusing their eyes. I&#39;d suggest deleting this sentence and replacing it with something else indicating that he was checking the Words.<br><br>8) <i>I am no scion of Sylph.</i><br>Misspelling. The name of that particular spirit in Secret of Mana is &quot;Sylphid&quot;, not &quot;Sylph&quot;.<br><br>9) <i>“Wait, him? So, you like guys or something?”</i><br>Just a style suggestion, but put &quot;him&quot; in quotes or italicize it.<br><br>10) <i>The last time I brought the subject to my orientation, my companion at the time had a panic attack.</i><br>Should be &quot;The last time I brought up the subject <b>of</b> my orientation&quot;.<br><br>11) <i>Stephanie might have been an eleven-foot kraken, but she remained an octopus,</i><br>That should be &quot;part octopus&quot;<br><br>12) <i>The agents poked their heads out of the water, staring in morbid fascination at the sight of an unidentified pirate captain declaring that Undertow was <b>“you’re new master”</b> before giving him some kind of amulet.</i><br>As much as I like picking on badfics&#39; lack of grammar, you&#39;re actually amiss. Here&#39;s the context:<br><br><b>&quot;Are you the Undertow?&quot; the captain asked.<br><br>&quot;Yeah,&quot; replied Undertow. &quot;Who&#39;s asking?&quot;<br><br>He then sees the captain smiling as the human uses his sword and moves it close to the shark&#39;s throat. &quot;You&#39;re new master.</b><br><br>Your/you&#39;re error aside, it&#39;s clear that the pirate captain was calling himself Undertow&#39;s new master. A quick fix is in order: &quot;The agents poked their heads out of the water, staring in morbid fascination at the sight of an unidentified pirate captain declaring to Undertow that he was <b>“you’re new master”</b> before giving him some kind of amulet.&quot;<br><br>13) <i>The kraken looked puzzled. “Why, what does Cupid have to do?”</i><br>Try this instead: &quot;Why? And what does Cupid have to do?&quot;<br><br>14) &quot;James&quot; came right out of nowhere; I do not recall him being in the badfic. Where did he come from?<br><br>15) I know that Lapis said that she&#39;d only keep one pov, but she sent two to HQ via the same portal. Where&#39;s the Normal pov?<br><br>16) <i>We can buy them from the Armory with our own pay!</i><br>Pay? What pay?</p>

            <p>2) I&#39;ll keep things as is here, since Lapis tends to speak rather quickly when flustered.<br><br>6) The angelfish pun was intentional but I guess I kinda forced it in this line. The wing fins are also an unnecessary addition, so I got rid of them in the text.<br><br>7) The reason I chose the listening option is because Cupid can&#39;t read, and I always thought he&#39;d listen to the Words instead. There is another illiterate agent, Unger, but I don&#39;t know how he handled the Words on his missions (as his partner usually led them). I replaced it with just checking the Words, though, to leave it deliberately unclear.<br><br>15) She probably sent it to where POVs are sent by default.

            <p>Your agents and their interactions are hilarious.<br><br>Unfortunately, there is apparently a continuity error:<br><i>“Oh, yeah, I forgot about you guys!” she said, opening a portal and sending the povs to HQ.</i><br><br><i>Lapis began breathing fast, hugging both her pov and her monkey so tightly that it was hard for them to breathe.</i><br>Either the sending to HQ should not have happened, or this pov should not be there. (Was &quot;Melody’s pov&quot; dragged back when the badfic changed point of view again? We should have seen Lapis’s reaction to this event. The &quot;Normal pov&quot; may have respawned with &quot;The Artic&quot; on page 22, but then it should be with Stephanie and Cupid. Also, I wonder what the Artic looks like and why it causes coldness.)<br><br><i>The agents (and their companion<b>s</b>) fell silent, watching the fic play out.</i><br>As far as we know, Triton the Oshawott should be Lapis and Chakkik’s only companion at this time. <br><br><i>Then she opened a portal before leading Chakkik, Triton, and the povs to the same little beach as before.</i><br>As far as we know, the povs should not be there.<br><br>Also, there is a weird sentence:<br><i>Chakkik silently killed more of the Generic Pirates, avoiding Deadnite and Titus until it was absolutely necessary.</i><br>I see what you mean there, but isn’t that what was absolutely necessary in the end the opposite of &quot;avoiding Deadnite and Titus&quot;?<br><br><i>... Chris could only watch helplessly as the tentacle that had captured him <b>from</b> lifted him a hundred feet above the sinking ship ...</i><br>Either one word too much or some words missing?<br><br><i>And as Christopher Sparrow screamed <b>his last,</b> Davy Jones’ Kraken dragged the remains of Captain Deadnite’s ship, and every single one of its remaining crew members, down into the depths of the deep, dark, Scandinavian sea.</i><br>Missing word? I’m not entirely sure whether, in English, it is necessary to specify whether this was his last word or his last scream or whatever. (In German, the sentence would work as it stands, if &quot;last&quot; were capitalized to show that it is used like a noun and meant to be the sentences object rather than an adjective to this object.)<br><br><i>On that note, I <b>would to extend</b> a hand –</i><br>Missing word?<br><br>HG</p>

            <p>A quick breakdown of the rules:<br><br>1. First and foremost, if you&#39;re going to do <i>anything</i> potentially serious or even permanent to the bodies that your character is inhabiting for the duration of the event, please make sure to clear it with said character&#39;s writer. Besides seriously injuring them or even killing them, this also includes things like, say, giving them haircuts or permanently changing their species. <br><br>2. Following that first part, no godmoding/power-playing! Control your own characters and your own characters only. <br><br>3. Like the title says, this is the Chaos thread. This is pretty much all characters affected reacting (and so on). This thread is going to cover the whole duration of the event (with things being resolved by Thursday evening). Feel free to note what day it is when you start a new thread towards the top of the post! To try and make an attempt at keeping things organized, there will be a separate post for hunting for the device as well, which will go up a bit later.<br><br>Good luck and have fun!</p>

            <p>&quot;Do I <i>look</i> okay?&quot; Kat demanded, indignant. Her voice was not her voice; it was something male, and with overtones that she wasn&#39;t thinking about too hard but probably had something to do with suddenly being a Pokémon. It was odd-- in the DORKS-induced Luxray costume, she had felt herself still. Now, it was both familiar and alien at the same time, and <i>she didn&#39;t like it.</i><br><br>&quot;And I&#39;m a Luxray, <i>for your information,</i>&quot; she added in a moment, sniffing affrontedly.

It was still super weird, but it helped. &quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; she said in a moment, twisting to look at the rest of her body. Luxray, yes, she&#39;d caught that much, but she didn&#39;t see any distinguishing marks, either.<br><br>It felt like she was wearing a collar -- maybe that was why she could talk? -- but she could hardly see it.

            <p>Kat gave him a look of thinly disguised horror, which didn&#39;t communicate over-well on her current face shape. &quot;Pokémon. A Luxray is a fully evolved electric-type that favors physical attack, rather than special. I personally don&#39;t think the mechanics did them any favors, but I do love them anyway. ...I love a lot of Pokémon. That same mission, my partner was a Mudkip, y&#39;know? They were memetic for a while, these little blue... mud fish things. Adorable. Surprisingly tanky when you train them right. But, y&#39;know, my partner, he&#39;s this great six foot some lankybones what&#39;s good with a sword, so seeing him as a bitty bitty Mudkip was basically the best thing about that mission.&quot; She heaved a huge and theatrical sigh-- it didn&#39;t seem like she&#39;d paused for breath at all during the stream-of-consciousness. <br><br>&quot;...what if they&#39;re not in our bodies?&quot; she wondered, a moment later, distracted next by that idea.</p>

Of course, being an Elf of the First Age, he was also fully aware that it was to his advantage to rest comfortably when the opportunity arose. Today he had taken his chance with the utmost gratitude: the study of Primitive Quendian was taxing, and held little enjoyment for him as it came with the knowledge that he was learning the tongue solely to be able to communicate with one stubborn Elf, who glared at any mispronunciation of a language that had not been spoken in over an Age.<br><br>It seemed however, that this welcome rest had ended for now.

He much preferred his own form--which was, it seemed, currently being inhabited by another.<br><br>Naergondir set his borrowed features in a frown, and lengthened his stride. It was time to return to his own response center.<br><br>--<br>((I expect they shouldn&#39;t actually arrive until after Gurnirel and Amy have at least figured out that Naergondir isn&#39;t Naergondir/she&#39;s in an elven SIELU agent&#39;s body and that&#39;s his partner being concerned. I expect we can do some back and forth in the hallway here? Keep them walking until Gurnirel and Amy have advanced enough?<br><br>Mind you, now I&#39;m wondering if they&#39;re all going to end up with some new friends by the end of this...<br><br>~DF))</p>

            <p>Vania hummed a bit as they started down the hallway.  A few other people were out and about as well, but they seemed in a hurry and didn&#39;t glance at the two.

            <p>The Sunflower Official had been reviewing reports- an task easier said than done, with agents who came to yell about their last mission, tell him about their latest partner disappearing into the multiverse or dying, or just to generally complain in the time he spent in his office just to work on usual department matters. There was a strange sensation- something he brushed off as exhuastion, or possibly too much fertilizer- and then everything went dark.<br><br>His photosensors were refusing to register anything and everything else he was sensing <i>differently</i>. A heartbeat. Breathing. Close by. From <i>him</i>? <br><br>He attempted to curl a leaf, experimentally. There wasn&#39;t one- an arm, a hand and the <i>very</i> strange sensation of flesh touching itself. This was <i>not</i> his body. <i>What in the-</i> he cut off, realizing the words weren&#39;t projecting like they should have been. He tried to move forward. It immediately became clear that this was not well thought out. He stumbled, off balance. The matter wasn&#39;t helped by the fact he still <i>couldn&#39;t see</i>. Still, he had mastered walking once, in his own body. In some humanoid body- however that had happened- it couldn&#39;t be <i>that</i> difficult. <br><br>The Sunflower Official tried once more, and found the side of something metal with his new knee. &quot;Agh,&quot; he successfully vocalized.</p>

            <p>((And thank you! Always fun to see something like this :D Especially when you wake up to it (as I did on the day when I started writing this).<br><br>Meldaner is indeed &#39;beloved man&#39;, though I also have it translated somewhere as &#39;beloved and dear man&#39;. I&#39;m glad you like it. I almost definitely found it on realelvish.net. It&#39;s either taken from their name lists--they have these pages where they take root words and show you a lot of possible names, sometimes using two root words--or else is something I put together from those name lists. I suspect the former, since it&#39;s a pretty simple name--one root word plus an ending.<br><br>Also, just...thank you for doing this :D <s>and please don&#39;t feel like you have to resist that temptation</s> Actually seeing some of their dialogue as it should be (ie, untranslated)...that&#39;s just spectacular.

It looked very familiar, if a bit off. &quot;You okay?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I-&quot; His voice was definitely wrong. Sax blinked harder. The world came more into focus, but it was still blurry. He was staring at himself- the only difference was that it wasn&#39;t in a mirror. &quot;What&#39;s going on?&quot; His voice was way too high, and the last thing he could remember- &quot;Ohmygod.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Sax?&quot; The guy- whoever was in his body asked.<br><br>&quot;Yeah,&quot; he said, in the too-high voice.<br><br>&quot;We kinda screwed up.

Sax tried to ignore the longer nails on now feminine hands clicking lightly against the generic surface floor as he did. <br><br>Day reached down with his- her left hand, the right arm cradled against her, and Sax used it to help pull himself up. Day wasn&#39;t exactly a short girl, but Sax, as he&#39;d been reminded since being a little kid, was stupidly tall and still growing. Seeing everything from this low down was weird. <br><br>&quot;Which way&#39;s Medical again?&quot; Day asked.<br><br>&quot;We&#39;ll find it somehow.&quot;<br><br>With that, the two set off, at a slow, and quite frankly wobbly pace. <br><br>((Feel free to encounter them making their way to Medical!

            <p>Mia careened through the halls of HQ, trying not to think of DoSAT. Unfortunately, every step she took reminded her why she needed to get to DoSAT. She tried to distract herself by taking stock of her tool belt; she had all of the essentials, plus the monkey wrench, and a radio. She thought about trying to call the rest of BM (she assumed she had swapped into one of their members; the radio and tool set both matched that hypothesis) but she decided against it.

These two knew something, she was certain of it. <br><br>She ran up to them, curving to their right and then doing a roundabout to face them. &quot;What&#39;s happened?&quot; she demanded. &quot;And why am I in a different body?&quot;<br><br>((Just as a forewarning, Mia&#39;s sarcastic.

If you don&#39;t want that to happen to him, well, it doesn&#39;t have to.

This form is far too clumsy—not to mention telepathy blind!” He narrowed his eyes and cleared his throat, now a little too hoarse from screaming. “But it is obvious what you have been up to. Flouting child labor restrictions to enlist an illicit, single-digit agent to assist you in the field!”<br><br>The agent facing him—he recalled her face from a profile, but her name continued to elude him—emitted a series of incensed and flabbergasted sounds of denial.<br><br>“So, you admit it!&quot; crowed the Flower. &quot;I can see my department has its work cut out for it. Regulations clearly state that only PPC personnel and minis are to inhabit agent response centers.&quot; He raised a hand, carefully curled four fingers against his palm (<i>I&#39;m really starting to adapt to this! How dreadful.</i>), and gestured toward himself with his thumb. &quot;<i>He</i> is not PPC Personnel, madam. Your helper, intern, minion, indentured servant, or kidnapee—whoever he is—must go. As will I, as soon as I can get these blasted legs to cooperate.&quot; <br><br>Cautiously, the Marquis de Sod stood up, slipped a little on the floor, righted himself, and began marching away.<br></p>

            <p>Jenni seized not!Henry by the back of his adorable planets-and-rockets pajamas. Whoever was in there—she hadn&#39;t had a moment to stop and think about who it might be—they were pissing her off. She wasn&#39;t sure she&#39;d ever been so insulted, which was saying a lot, and on top of that, <i>they were messing with her son</i>.<br><br>Fortunately, she was still a lot bigger. She spun him around, took him by the shoulders, and got down on her knees to be eye-to-eye with him.<br><br>&quot;Let me make this perfectly clear,&quot; she said, just short of spitting the words out in fury. &quot;I&#39;ll use small words. &#39;This body&#39; belongs to my <i>son</i>.

            <p>Gradually, the haze of terror and anger faded from her mind enough that she was able to process some of what the nameless Flower had said so far. None of it was comforting.<br><br>&quot;I think,&quot; she said slowly, maintaining rigid control of herself, &quot;that we should go to the Kudzu first. We need more information, and that should be the quickest way to get it. Unless . . . <i>oh</i>.&quot; Her eyes went wide as she abruptly made the connection with her own bizarre experience of last night. Had that been the same phenomenon? The rule of Occam&#39;s Razor suggested as much. &quot;Unless this isn&#39;t an isolated incident,&quot; she finished. What a discouraging thought.

It&#39;s all been fair enough so far, but it is godmoding, and when there are more players involved and more stuff to respond to, I&#39;d like all the decisions to be mine. I&#39;ll quit having Jenni manhandle Marquis!Henry with impunity, too—unless it&#39;s pretty obvious that that&#39;s what you&#39;re going for, like it was when he was about to march out of the RC. ))</p>

            <p>Failing that, he thought loudly inside his head. <br><br><i>Henry. Henry, are you there?</i><br><br>Silence. As he expected.<br><br>The Marquis sighed internally. He didn&#39;t really think it would work, anyway.<br><br>&quot;I&#39;m quite certain he isn&#39;t.

I have to save it!&quot; <br><br>Abruptly, he stopped and took several deep breaths. This was, oddly, the one comfort he took in being human: it really calmed him down to breath in through the nose and out through the mouth, as he&#39;d witnessed countless agents do when on the verge of a mental breakdown. &quot;Right. The Kudzu.&quot;<br><br>((Oh, hooray! Can&#39;t wait to meet the Kudzu. Sorry about mucking about with Jenni&#39;s facial expressions; I thought it was just action and dialogue I had to watch out for. Never RP&#39;d before, actually, so this is a learning experience!))</p>

Missed.&quot;<br><br>Printworthy smiled, as he pulled himself to his desk. &quot;Anyway, the argument is irrelevant. We destroyed it, and that is that. Now, would you kindly put something on the television? Anything will do.&quot;<br><br>Marvin sighed as he hefted himself off the bed. &quot;I ain&#39;t from Rapture you know. No, don&#39;t worry about it. Bioshock. You should play it some time. Amazing story, twist blew my mind. Anyway, let&#39;s see... We never did finish Farscape, did we?

Oh, be careful with the-&quot;<br><br>Marvin slammed his head on the lower shelf, again. This time however, his vision faded to black.<br><br>----<br><br>Printworthy lifted his head from the desk, his vision still fuzzy from his sudden loss of consciousness. <i>Ooh, stars above. What was that?</i> He glanced down, and his mind reeled with the rush of information.<br><br>When one changes shape, it often takes the mind some time to process what the exact nature of the new form it finds itself in. Printworthy was used to this feeling, given the nature of his work. He has been a griffon, a human, even a lizard, once. But there are some small comforts the mind can take in new bodies. Yes, it may no longer in the usual place, but there was a heart, tirelessly beating away, sending all too familiar blood across a body of skin and bones. The rocks may not press against the skin in the exact same way, but the general feeling is universal. Even the loss of gain of scenes is not all too difficult. The things being sensed were always there, the mind is just able to take in a new perspective of it. This, however, was different.<br><br>Printworthy could not see, perse, as there were no eyes for which to see with. Instead, he felt the world round him, color imprinting itself onto the mind, rather then being observed. There was liquid flowing through veins, but blood it was not, nor a heartbeat pushing it through. Printworthy looked around wildly, struggling to aquatint himself with how different the world now was. Nothing felt right. The world kept pushing itself on him, forcing him to feel everything. And the <i>noise!</i> He was used to the ebbs and flows of magic in the air, but this was something else. He could feel whispers all around him, the lost and confused, as nearby minds also struggled with their new forms. The psychic energy was almost overwhelming. <br><br>Printworthy took a deep breath, pulling in the air through his skin, trying to relax. <i>No mouth. Breath through skin. And the ferns everywhere... Oh. Oh no. I&#39;m not...</i><br><br>Printworthy had no mouth, and yet, he screamed.<br><br>((I&#39;ll get to Marvin&#39;s POV in a later post. This should be interesting.))</p>

There was a big, puffy leather chair in one corner, and a long couch in the other. He spotted a mirror hanging on the wall above a nearby desk. He scrambled over, stumbling with newfound lightness in his step. He looked long and hard into the mirror.<br><br>Somebody else was staring back. He was blonde, for one, with a distressingly feminine face. Or, perhaps, she... Marvin sent a hand down. He sighed. &quot;Oh. Well then. Great.&quot; He spent more time looking in the mirror One thing was clear. This was not his body. Something put him in this one. <br><br>And when he found his suspected &#39;something,&#39; he was going to give it a <i>stern</i> talking to.<br><br>((Was that ambiguous enough for you, Nesh? I hope so. Now, to get Marvin to meet somebody...))</p>

            <p>The Yellow Rose had been with her sisters when she felt the consciousness transfer hit, but had been powerless to stop it. When it was over, she saw - and she actually <i>saw</i>, as opposed to telepathically sensed - that she was in a different room. <br><br>The brightness and the colors took a bit of getting used to, as did bipedal motion, but when she&#39;d mastered the basics of her new body, she realised that it presented a wonderful opportunity. She hadn&#39;t seen her beloved, the Sunflower Official, ever since that business with the party and the restraining order, but with this perfect disguise she could probably get him in her fronds, well <i>hands</i>, before he could object. <br><br>She didn&#39;t know where she was, and so had no idea how to get the her beloved&#39;s office, but decided to start with a methodical search until she could get her bearings. <br><br>She stepped out into the corridor, then opened the very first door she saw. <br><br>(So yeah, this Flower is in Nurse Elms&#39;s body, although probably doesn&#39;t know that specifically yet) </p>

            <p>FicPsych personnel? At least now she knew where she was, and while FicPsych may be far away from the magnificent Sunflower Official&#39;s office, things could have been a lot worse - at least she had swapped into the body of a staff member, and not a patient. She was still free to move around, if slightly unsteadily. <br><br>&quot;I don&#39;t,&quot; she said, or at least, she tried to say. Unfortunately, enunciation takes a bit of practice when all you&#39;re used to is pure thought, so it came out as &quot;Ah dunh.&quot;<br><br>She tried again, but while her voice was clear this time, the concentration required to get the primitive mouth-parts to do what she wanted meant that she couldn&#39;t spare any thoughts for her legs, and she toppled over. <br><br><i>What is wrong with nice, sensible roots?</i> she thought, sprawled on the floor.</p>

            <p>No, that wasn&#39;t right - try again. &quot;Th-an-k you,&quot; she said, pronouncing her words with the deliberate and exaggerated care normally only displayed by the severely tipsy. <br><br>The Rose noticed the rather interesting sensation of their bodies touching as she was helped into a chair - it was different to the experience of two Flowers touching stems, but oddly pleasant.  <br><br>Once settled in the chair she could concentrate more on speaking. &quot;I am having some... difficulty... with this body.

            <p>&quot;I don&#39;t really have a name,&quot; the Rose said.

            <p>The Bonsai Mallorn was vaguely aware of some kind of sensation on the sides of his &#39;head&#39;, a modulating pressure that transformed into something almost, but not quite, like hearing another&#39;s thoughts.

            <p>Corolla kept tinkering with the surplus D.O.R.K.S. she had managed to claim for herself, attempting to build another Magic-Optical Obfuscation Outfitter.<br><br>So far, with no success. There was no such thing as &quot;stardardization&quot; in DoSAT tech, meaning that the device she had in hand didn&#39;t have the same internal hardware as the other one, and the Unison Device had forgotten to take notes while she was building the first M.O.O.O.<br><br>Corolla jumped back as the machine started emitting sparks. &quot;Not again!

Not only she wasn&#39;t at her working table anymore, but her body... wasn&#39;t her body anymore.<br>&quot;This definitely isn&#39;t right.&quot; Corolla repeated as she realized that her current body was currently that of a well-built male. Only then she noticed that in front of her was a young blonde woman.<br>&quot;Uhm, hi? I might&#39;ve messed up something.&quot;<br><br>[So, Corolla&#39;s thinking that her current situation is a malfunction of the device she was tinkering with.

            <p>&quot;Now that you mention it, since the D.O.R.K.S. I modified isn&#39;t with me right now, we should theoretically be out of range for its disguise effect to... well, have effect.&quot;<br><br>Corolla continued thinking out loud as she picked up pace, not realizing that she was starting to drag the poor Katie. &quot;That is unless the capacitors suddenly discharged all at once, which would indeed send out a powerful enough disguise field burst to forcefully disguise the two of us, and maybe more. However, that would also destroy the chameleon matrix emitter shortly after the first disguise field wave, meaning that we wouldn&#39;t be in disguise right now. And it also doesn&#39;t explain my sudden teleportation, unless that is a side effect of the fact that I apparently crashed while working on the machine, and that accidentally activated my Remote Activator subprogram - yes, if you were wondering I&#39;m normally a Magitek construct - so we might not be looking for my machine after all.&quot;</p>

            <p>It was a normal day in RC 1817. <br><br>The RC’s inhabitants, Agents Michael and Mia, DF, had fallen into a morning pattern. Every day, Michael got up first after his night terrors woke him, and began brewing two cups of coffee. While they came into being, he made himself and his partner breakfast sandwiches of toast and eggs. Just as they were finished, Mia emerged from her room, already dressed in black leather and sunglasses, ready for a day of missions. The two sat at the RC’s only table, facing each other and saying nothing, like they were rivals over a chess board. They each sipped coffee, munched sandwiches, and kept their thoughts to themselves. <br><br>Until their thoughts moved. <br>____________________________________________________<strong><em><br><br>One moment, Michael was just bringing his mug to his lips. The next, he… wasn’t. <br><br>He gasped, only there were no lungs to gasp with. He felt… mechanical… there were no true sensations, only simulations. Michael also realized that he was no longer looking RC, but a totally foreign space. <br><br>He screamed. A deep, robotic sound reverberated from him, even though he didn’t seem to have a mouth. “What is happening!” he thought desperately. And then he saw the people in the RC with him. <br><br>((Agent Michael, in Amris’s body. Awaiting Des, I believe.))<br><br></em></strong>___________________________________________________<strong><em><br><br>Mia felt much the same. Just as she took a bite of her sandwich, everything shifted. She found herself standing, hands full of a monkey wrench, in the middle of a hallway. <br><br>But the hands grasping the monkey wrench weren’t her own. <br><br>Mia closed her eyes; in situations like this, in which there was no clear answer at first, she let her mind take over and her emotions fall by the wayside. “<i>I was in the RC, now I’m not. No dizziness, as from blunt trauma to the head. No breathlessness from running. I was transported; I didn’t come on my own. Conclusion: HQ-wide body swap.</i>”<br><br>Mia opened her eyes. The best place to look for answers would be DoSAT. She took a step forward, and then realized… “I’m male. Lovely.”<br><br>*********************************************************<br><br>Agents Alleb and Jesse were just leaving their RC when disaster struck. <br><br>They had been planning to venture together into the strange, unknown world called “Rudi’s.” Alleb, a knight of medieval-style Alleble transported into HQ by herKing, and Jesse, a Civil War veteran, had been having a hard time adjusting to their new life. <br><br>They had an even harder time adjusting when they both had new bodies. <br><br></em></strong>___________________________________________________<strong><em><br><br>Just as Jesse set one foot outside his RC, everything shifted. He couldn’t see or hear or breathe or even think in the same way he had before. Panic set in immediately, although not as bad as it might have been in someone who hadn’t fought in places like he had, seen things like he had, or done things like he had. <br><br>Jesse tried to move an arm, but odd images told him that there weren’t arms to move, but instead… leaves? His head wasn’t his own either, nor his feet. He realized with a shock that he wasn’t wearing any clothes. &quot;<i>What is happening?</i>” he thought. The panic began to rise again. “<i>What is happening!?</i>”<br><br>He suddenly realized that he had no idea where he was, or who he was, or what was happening to Alleb and his own body. He screamed inside his mind; a horrible, anguished scream that would have broken the hearts of any who heard it. Jesse knew that; he’d heard screams just like it on the battlefield. That thought triggered the images. The images Jesse had kept locked up tight, in the little back right corner of his mind. The images that still haunted him in nightmares. <br><br>Jesse doubled over, the things that passed for hands pressed to what passed for his head, and tried to survive his memories of the war. <br><br></em></strong>______________________________________________________<br><br>Alleb had a somewhat better time of it. Just as she was closing the door of her RC, she was sitting at a table, a cup of something sweet and warm to her lips. She coughed and sprayed it out, unfortunately hitting a girl sitting across from her. <br><br>“I’m so sor--” she began, then stopped. Her voice was different. And where was she? What had happened to Jesse and her RC? <br><br>She looked around, then down at herself. She was in a different body. <br><br>And it was male. <br><br>“GREAT MOONRASCALS!!”<br><br><br>((Wooohooo, Body Swap RP! I&#39;m not quite sure what to do with poor Michael; the Librarian and Agent Des weren&#39;t swapped, so I don&#39;t know if Des would mind writing for them while Michael is over there.))<br><br>((-Alleb))</p>

            <p>After a while, Jesse&#39;s memories slacked off. He uncurled shaking fronds and straightened; although he felt weakened by the mental pain, he felt stronger for having gone through it. <br><br>&quot;<i>Now,</i>&quot; he thought. His voice echoed in his head. &quot;<i>What to do. I don&#39;t know where I am, or what I am, or how I got here. I don&#39;t know where Alleb is, or where my body is.</i>&quot; The very thought made him queasy; nothing in all of his experience had prepared him for this. Not only that, this entire line of thought seemed hopeless. &quot;<i>What do I know?</i>&quot; he thought. The list was pretty short. <br>_______________________________________________________<br><br>Michael finished his calm breathing, and felt much better. Before he could freak out again, he stood, and walked towards what he assumed was the bathroom. The RC he was in was sparse; there was only the bed, an old sink and stove, and bare concrit. The door to the bathroom was ajar, while the one that presumably led outside was shut and chain-locked. <br><br>Michael flicked on the light and looked at his face in the mirror. For a moment, he could only stare; it was Molly peering back at him. He brushed his trembling fingertips against his new cheek, eyes watering.  &quot;Oh, Molly,&quot; he said. &quot;I miss you...&quot; His hand clenched involuntarily into a fist. <br><br>&quot;<i>Schinkt!</i>&quot;<br><br>Pain burned in Michael&#39;s hand and in thin lines across his head. He gasped, stumbling back and flailing wildly. Even as he fell to the floor, the pain receded. His movement had left deep gouges in the door and its posts. Michael raised his hand and marveled at the adamantium claws. <br><br>&quot;They didn&#39;t just turn me into a girl...&quot;<br></p>

            <p>((For Reasons, Michael is no longer swapping into Amris. Onto the RP!))<br><br>One moment, Michael Green was just bringing his mug to his lips. The next, he… wasn’t. <br><br>He was lying on a bed in a strange RC, staring at the ceiling. He sat up with a gasp; an oddly feminine gasp. He whipped his head around, and was struck in the face out of nowhere. Someone was attacking him! He fell back on the bed, fighting his opponent, but then realized that it was… hair. <br><br>His own hair. <br><br>“What’s happening!?” he said, frantically fingering this new growth of braided hair. It was the same color as his, and had the blue streak, but it was so long! Nearly to his waist! And his body… “Oh, Colors!” he said, using one of his favorite fantasy “curses.” He was female! He’d been turned into a girl!<br><br>“Okay, Michael,” he thought, putting his head in his hands. “Deep breaths. Calming breaths. Don’t freak out, don’t freak out, don’t freak out. Think about Molly. Molly’d know what to do… <br><br>Actually, she’d probably just fall over laughing at me.”<br><br>The thought of Michael’s twin, Molly, laughing at his strange predicament made him feel better. Not totally alright, but better. He took his own advice and took several deep breaths before looking down again. <br><br>Yup. He was a girl. <br><br>“Oookaay, time for some more calm breathing…”<br><br>*********************************************************<br><br>Molly Green lay on her bed in her RC, staring at the ceiling. “I’m going to find Michael today,” she said to the empty room. Her brother had disappeared the day before she had been flung into a world of madness; it had been three in-universe years since she’d seen him, although she hadn’t aged a day.   <br><br>She held up her hand and made a fist. “Schinkt!” Adamantium claws extended, slicing the air. It hurt, of course, but the wounds healed right up when she retracted the blades. She let her arm fall limply to the bed, still staring upwards. Three years of living in a Marvel fic, gaining a different power every day as the story demanded, until finally being rescued by two agents. Three years of thinking she would never see her brother or the rest of her family again. Three years. <br><br>Just as she tensed to push herself out of bed, everything changed. <br><br>((No further writing from Molly, I&#39;m afraid, but Michael&#39;s going to have a time of it. <br><br>-Alleb))</p>

            <p>Cyba hummed happily as she polished her various suits of armour arrayed on stands in the RC. It was not often that she got the time between missions so she was making the most of it.<br><br>Eagrus, meanwhile, was continuing to practice his newly-discovered art of spellcasting, poring over his copy of a spellbook acquired during the Blackout.

The third thing he noticed was he was standing in FicPsych, next to a desk with a sandle mounted on it.

            <p>Captain Dandy did his best to cultivate the idea that he could not be surprised. It wasn&#39;t true, of course, but the facade was useful when dealing with others. Everyone in the PPC needed to believe that the Department of External Security was an ever-vigilant force, a bastion of strength and reliability.<br><br>So it was a very good thing no one could see him know, because he was most definitely surprised. In multiple ways, too.<br><br>This was not his office, but the bedroom of an unfamiliar response center. This was not his body, either; his psychic perception was gone, replaced by what he understood to be humanoid senses. Well, mostly. This particular body seemed to be augmented with technological enhancements. His… what was the word… <i>vision</i>, was complimented by a stream of analytic data telling him about his surroundings.<br><br><b>WHUMP</b><br><br>This body was also not very stable. It had nothing to do with the fact that Captain Dandy was unfamiliar with humanoid legs. That would be a preposterous suggestion.<br><br>He pulled himself back to his feet and staggered towards the door. It slid open just in time for the displaced Flower to catch himself on the frame.<br><br>There was an unfamiliar dark-skinned humanoid standing in the other room. He was wearing a DMS flash patch, which was a vague comfort to Captain Dandy.<br><br><i>Who are you?</i> he thought. <br><br>It took a few silent moments for Captain Dandy to remember that this body probably used the shaping of air into sounds to communicate rather than psychic projection. He quickly dismissed the vaguely embarrassed feeling that stole over him. There was no time for that.<br><br>&quot;Huh…&quot; His… gah, another unfamiliar thing... his <i>tongue</i> struggled with the words. &quot;Who… who are you? Where am I?&quot;</p>

            <p>Captain Dandy was doing his best not to completely freak out. Appearances and everything. It was very much a balancing act — a bit like like trying to stand in this new body, actually. So far, he had been able to tamp down the worst of it. But what this other person seemed to be suggesting — that whatever this was had happened to multiple personnel across the entire PPC — combined with their prattling on about whatever seemed to be at the top of their mind was wearing on him.<br><br><b>&quot;EHNUAAAH!&quot;</b><br><br>Damp fertilizer. He meant to shout &quot;Enough!&quot; but his control over words in this body hadn&#39;t quite expanded to those with multiple syllables.<br><br>Captain Dandy pushed himself off of the doorframe and took a step forward, which quickly turned into a stumble forward. He managed to right himself for a second, but quickly found that he was now teetering backwards. The displaced Flower thrust out his arms to stop himself from falling back through the door. There was crunching noise as the fingers on his artificial left hand dug into the Generic Wall like roots in the soil.<br><br>This was not helping his attempts to keep calm.<br><br>&quot;What,&quot; he managed. &quot;What hap. Haaap. End.&quot;</p>

            <p>&quot;You&#39;re not used to a humanoid body, are you?&quot; Cyba asked. She proffered an arm. &quot;Here, lean on me until you get your balance. Treat it like a mission disguise and you should be fine. Something&#39;s swapped our bodies around and somehow I&#39;m thinking my agent partner isn&#39;t powerful enough for a spell backfire to affect this sort of radius.

            <p>The &quot;mission disguise&quot; analogue wasn&#39;t a perfect analogue for this situation, but it worked. Dandy was briefly embarrassed he had not thought of it before. He chalked it up to the feelings of dread, confusion, and panic currently coursing through his body. Not that he would ever admit that, of course.<br><br>He reached out with his non-augmented hand and took Cyba&#39;s arm. There was another, quieter crunching noise as he pulled his cybernetic fingers out of the wall.

He ignored it.<br><br>&quot;Weee…&quot; Dandy closed his eyes and shook his head. Speaking was getting easier, but he still had to focus on the words. &quot;We need to speak to the Board of...

            <p>He had been considering how to respond to this question ever since Cyba had given her name.

Hiding information during a mission was never a sustainable action. <br><br>Oh, damp fertilizer.<br><br>&quot;It could,&quot; he finally said. &quot;And it did.

            <p>Xericka had spent a few informative minutes attempting to assert control over her new body. The physical aspects had taken relatively little time.

The voice sounded different - of course it did, she was hearing it through some primitive means; something to do with flaps of skin, or were those being ignored entirely? Even so, the voice sounded wrong. <br><br>The effort of jumping clear over the desk had done something to her body - instead of speaking normally, it seemed to want to gulp in huge quantities of air. &quot;Are you... are you... <i>really</i> the Sunflower?&quot;</p>

            <p>&quot;So,&quot; asked Sean as the two agents set off down the corridor, &quot;what&#39;s this news you&#39;ve been dying to tell me?&quot;<br><br>Hild had wanted to tell her partner as soon as the message had flashed up on their console, but had waited so she could use it as a distraction as they walked to the cafeteria for lunch.  &quot;Do you remember that Jeeves mission we had?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yeah.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Well, I heard the Mini Adoption Agency has a Mini-Jeeves, so I sent them a message asking if we could take it.&quot;<br><br>&quot;You did what?&quot;  Sean stopped, and instinctively flexed his arm as if about to punch the wall.<br><br>&quot;Don&#39;t worry,&quot; said Hild, turning back to him.  &quot;It&#39;s on a week&#39;s trial, so we can send him back if we don&#39;t like him.  And a Mini butler could be more useful around the RC than a pet.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Valet,&quot; automatically corrected Sean.  &quot;But, yeah, I see your point.  We can stop by there on the way back from lunch.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Thanks.&quot;  Hild knew Sean wasn&#39;t the hugging type, so she just gave him a quick pat on the shoulder, and they continued on their way.<br><br>&quot;So, talking of Jeeves, how are you doing with the books?&quot; he asked.<br><br>&quot;Not bad.  I&#39;m partway into <i>The Code of the Woosters </i>now.  Just got to the bit where Gussie describes how he&#39;s been making lists of people&#39;s bad points in his notebook.&quot;  She grinned.  &quot;Maybe we should recruit him to help write the charges.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Are you sure?  Remember Madeline Bassett.  Gussie would probably fall in love with every fairy princess Sue that came along.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Good point.&quot;<br><br>Before she could say any more, everything changed.<br></p>

            <p>...drew the attention of many Green team agents. There were several shouts of surprise as Kyaris&#39; body collapsed into the alley between cubicles, followed by more shouts as an entire DoI team&#39;s worth of agents suddenly found themselves being <i>not</i> themselves. <br><br>A few minutes later, a portal opened in Cubicle 5294 and let through a tall, scrawny man and a short Chinese woman. The conversation they were having was interrupted by the chaos outside their cubicle. <br><br>&quot;What,&quot; said Penny Chang, &quot;is going on here? What&#39;s with all of this yelling?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I don&#39;t know, ma&#39;am,&quot; said Gaspard De Grasse, climbing on top of the equipment chest to peer at the rest of Green team in their cubicles. &quot;Everyone just seems to be freaking out all of a sudden...&quot; He immediately pulled a gas mask from the Pouch of Holding at his belt and slipped it on. &quot;Chemical attack?&quot; he said, his voice muffled by the rubber and plastic. &quot;Some nerve agent maybe? Should we evacuate?&quot;<br><br>&quot;No, hold on,&quot; said Penny, raising a hand. &quot;<i>He</i> might be able to explain what&#39;s going on.&quot; A Zorua ran up to the two agents and dove on the nearest stack of papers, furiously scribbling a message onto the paper. <br><br>&quot;event cause unknown, was outside of hq when this happened, returned approx 5 minutes before you, came here and found this,&quot; wrote Tacitus frantically. &quot;appears to be mass hysteria, all agents encountered suffering from this. directives?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Go out there and investigate,&quot; ordered Penny. &quot;Determine the extent of this situation. Find the cause. Report to me when you find it. From there we&#39;ll review our findings and decide on the next step.&quot;<br><br>&quot;yes, Madam,&quot; wrote Tacitus before dashing off towards the DoI Hub.<br><br>&quot;I think you can take off the gas mask,&quot; said Penny to her colleague. &quot;This doesn&#39;t seem to be a chemical agent: if that were the case, Tacitus wouldn&#39;t be... er. Like <i>them</i>.&quot; She waved a hand towards the rest of the room.<br><br>&quot;Point taken,&quot; replied Gaspard, pulling off his mask. &quot;What do you think DIA will do? If this is bigger than just the Action Room...&quot;<br><br>&quot;My guess is that the Yertis&#39; New Cal division will have to intervene,&quot; said Penny. &quot;Remember, whatever happened here is limited to <i>inside</i> Headquarters. They should be in a position to fix whatever happened here.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Right, right. Er, shall we start investigating, ma&#39;am?&quot; said Gaspard. &quot;Some people might need help out there.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Let&#39;s go. Stick to me.&quot; <br><br>Penny led Gaspard out into the cubicle maze. Almost immediately after leaving the cubicle, they found Kyaris&#39; body blocking an alley. The two Spies kneeled next to the hydra. &quot;Er... Kyaris?&quot; said Gaspard, tapping the ground next to the closest head with his palm. &quot;Are you all right?&quot;</p>

            <p>Earlier, he had been heading for a job request before... whatever happened. And then Denny was suddenly in somewhere in the middle of the Department of Intelligence&#39;s maze of cubicles. The only reason he knew where he was- since normally personnel and agents who weren&#39;t in Intelligence themselves didn&#39;t set foot in the area- was because he&#39;d done jobs to fix things up there before. Usually with Colt.<br><br>Whatever was going on, he <i>definitely</i> wasn&#39;t himself- it wasn&#39;t his body, that was for sure- which could&#39;ve meant anything with HQ being what it was. &quot;This is really a lame job, sometimes,&quot; he muttered, as he made his way trying to find anyone who wasn&#39;t panicking quite as badly as some of the surrounding agents.<br><br>Eventually he came upon the hydra and two nearby agents. The two standing didn&#39;t look quite as panicked or ill-at-ease. &quot;This is exciting,&quot; he said, dryly. &quot;I&#39;m Denny Robbs, BM. Any idea what&#39;s going on? Besides, y&#39;know, the fact a bunch of us are suddenly not ourselves. Or who this is, for that matter?&quot; He gestured at the body he was currently in.</p>

            <p>Agents stumbled around, trying to find out who was who and searching for the nearest shiny object to catch a glimpse of their own reflection.<br><br>&quot;Well,&quot; said Penny as she followed Sean through the portal. &quot;This is a mess. You got your Nurses <i>not</i> being Nurses, agents <i>not</i> being themselves, and everyone checking in for the same problem.&quot; She looked around. &quot;I wonder where the line starts... oh. Oh dear.&quot; The Chinese woman&#39;s expression darkened. &quot;If this is an HQ-wide event, I fear the Nursery might&#39;ve also been affected. Excuse me for a moment.&quot;<br><br>She stepped away from Sean and typed a phone number on her smartphone. Penny adjusted the fit of her earpiece as it rang. &quot;Hello, Tacitus? I need you to drop whatever you&#39;re doing right now. Go to the Nursery and scout out the place. If they&#39;ve been affected, organize something to get the children back. Clear?&quot;<br><br>On the other end of the line, Tacitus whistled, signalling his acknowledgement. Penny nodded and walked back to Sean. Even if his behaviour was reprehensible most of the time, the Zorua was a quick thinker and a skilled logistician. She could trust him to get the job done.<br><br>Penny looked around. Right. There was work to do here. Medical needed to be up and running again-- she&#39;d require a computer, a console or anything with ICEP. The Nurses needed to be recalled to Medical-- if they weren&#39;t already on their way. But first... Sean. Don&#39;t let a colleague down. &quot;Right,&quot; she said to the Assassin. &quot;Let&#39;s try to find someone who knows what&#39;s going on.&quot;<br><br></p>

After all, if this Kyaris was a DoI spy, she would need a disguise to pass unnoticed in fics that didn&#39;t feature multi-headed snake/horse hybrids.  Or was &quot;Horse Gets Pregnant by Many Different Snakes Simultaneously&quot; actually a common genre of Furry badifc?  Sean was, once again, glad he&#39;d turned down the opportunity to work in BadHet.<br><br>Sean lowered his raised head and turned it to face Penny.

            <p>Aaron had been comfortably dozing in his Response Center, enjoying a chance to catch up on his sleep.  The jolt of changing forms might not have managed to wake him, but Chakkik&#39;s shouting certainly was.<br><br>He recognized the smell of death and ozone that clung to his new body instantly.<br><br>Aaron liked to think that he wasn&#39;t racist against ghouls.  After all, they were people just like humans, weren&#39;t they?  Sure, they were horrifically decayed and would eventually go feral, becoming mindless brutes who were better than Super Mutants only in that they were easier to kill, but it wasn&#39;t exactly their fault.  That said, the idea of actually <i>becoming</i> one was not an idea he relished. At least, thought his slowly-growing sardonic side, it was better than the alternative.<br><br>He couldn&#39;t allow his mind to spin purposelessly, though.  He had to focus, try to figure out what had happened.  The answer to that question, though, was obvious.  There was only one thing that could turn a perfectly healthy human, well within the baseline range for mutations, into a shambling monstrosity... err, a being perfectly capable of productive contributions to society, but still rather unfortunately necrotized. <br><br>&quot;The Sues,&quot; he said hoarsely, to nobody in particular.  &quot;They must have bombed HQ.  I - I&#39;ve got to try and find Natasha, maybe she made it out.&quot;<br><br>((Fun fact about ghouls, for those of you who aren&#39;t familiar with Fallout - humans have a chance of becoming one if they somehow survive massive radiation, such as, say, a nuclear bomb going off.  So that&#39;s what Aaron&#39;s assumed has happened to him.<br><br>And Aaron is, in fact, mildly prejudiced against ghouls.))</p>

On the other, he wasn&#39;t exactly unsympathetic to Chakkik&#39;s perspective.<br><br>He was saved having to deal with this moral quandry by the sight of a familiar figure.

But Gollum, and the evil one crept up and slipped away with her.

            <p>As he followed his Gungan partner through the doorway, Bosh and Guk turned to look at the décor; various pieces of nautical equipment and replicas of marine life lined the walls, and rows of tables spread out across an expanse of wooden floorboards.<br><br>Guk scratched his head. &quot;This looks like a boat. Why are we on a boat?&quot;<br><br>Woon turned around, beaming at his ogre companion. &quot;Mesa made reservation for lunch today. My treat.&quot; He turned to converse briefly to a nearby hostess, then motioned for his partner to follow as she led the pair to an empty table. &quot;Yousa gunna be loven dis place!&quot; Woon exclaimed.<br><br>Bosh returned Woon&#39;s smile. &quot;We appreciate it, Woon. It&#39;s very kind.&quot; He picked up a menu, frowning as the name of he restaurant on the front was too faded to read. &quot;I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve heard of an establishment such as this within HQ before. Tell me, Woon, how did you find this place?&quot; he inquired.<br><br>&quot;Well, my walken down da hall and looken for da pool one day, and...&quot; <br><br>As Woon continued his story, Guk scanned the menu. &quot;This place only has fish. I don&#39;t like fish.&quot; he interrupted. When Bosh rolled his eyes and motioned for Woon to continue, Guk spoke up a bit louder. &quot;I said I don&#39;t like fish! It makes me gassy.&quot;<br><br>Bosh shot a glare at his counterpart. &quot;Guk, that&#39;s a lie and the both of us know it.&quot;<br><br>&quot;HE doesn&#39;t know it!&quot; Guk protested.<br><br>&quot;Guk, sometimes I wish I didn&#39;t have to deal with your-&quot;<br><br><i>WHUMP</i><br><br>The world went black.<br><br>***<br><br>Bosh shook his head, squinting as his vision returned. <i>Wait a moment.</i> he thought. <i>This isn&#39;t the restaurant. And why do I feel like I&#39;m wearing armor...?</i> <br><br>He glanced down and nearly jumped as he saw a human form wearing a red suit of armor. Turning his head, he observed the walls of an unfamiliar Response Center to his right, and to his left... <br><br>&quot;Guk?! GUK!&quot; <br><br>This was not his voice... and this was not his body.<br><br><i>Where am I? Who am I? Where is Guk?!</i><br><br>***<br>Guk rather enjoyed his new form.<br><br>Sure, he couldn&#39;t talk nearly as well as before, but this did not matter to him as he galloped through the walls of HQ, neighing wildly in pure joy. Agents jumped out of the way, shouting in horror as he continued his wild dash. <br>This was fun. He could go where he wanted, do what he wanted... and best of all? <br><br>No Bosh to tell him he couldn&#39;t.<br><br>***<br>Woon blinked. <i> Did mesa sit on da portal thingy again?</i> he wondered. <i>Dis isn&#39;t da fishy place.</i> Indeed, Woon had no idea where he was... and as he ran his too-short tongue over his teeth and felt a distinct lack of long ears, he had no idea WHAT he was, either. <i>A disguise? Oh, my not feelen bombad... </i><br><br>He passed out in the middle of a Generic Hallway.</p>

Chakkik looked down at himself; no, HERself. He had just filled his mouth with soothing absinthe when he had, rather suddenly, found himself someone else, someplace else, and doing something else. Namely, holding a controller in her hands (such an overly-simplistic interface, keyboards were much more precise) and playing what appeared to be the classic Legend of Zelda.<br><br>Worse, Chakkik could no longer feel a connection to Mana. The magical life-force that sustained the Mantis Ant was gone. This added panic to Chakkik&#39;s anger.<br><br>And last of all, there was a distinct lack of absinthe.<br><br>JF&#39;s face held a look of uncharacteristic savagery as its new occupant snarled. <br><br>&quot;WHO. IS. RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS.&quot;<br><br>~Meanwhile~<br><br>&quot;So... I&#39;m you now? And you&#39;re me?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Looks like it.&quot;<br><br>Valon and Kala had been fortunate enough to switch bodies with each other. As they had been watching a movie together, this was only mildly disorienting.<br><br>Valon-in-Kala&#39;s body suddenly smiled. &quot;You know, as long as we&#39;re like this...<br><br>((Notes on Chakkik, once July gets to playing.))<br><br>((First, he&#39;ll be in his human shape. He&#39;s become accustomed to it, so at the very least JF&#39;s species doesn&#39;t change.))<br><br>((Second, Chakkik kind of feels Mana as a dull hum so long as he&#39;s in HQ. If he were in his home continuum, he could communicate directly with Gnome, but as he is, all he can do is cast a few spells: Gem Missile, Stone Saber and Speed Up.))<br><br>((Third: One of Chakkik&#39;s abilities that he keeps in his human shape is his ability to breathe acid. He also drools acid when, say, one of his Lust-Objects shows up, but he&#39;s immune to it.))<br><br>((Fourth, and finally: Chakkik is a handsome bastard. He&#39;s powerfully built, athletic, and has a beautiful face. He&#39;s been quite a distraction to other agents he&#39;s worked with in the past.))<br><br>((As for my other agents... Stephanie is unaffected and asleep, and as shown, Valon and Kala just switched with each other.))<br><br>((I&#39;ll RP Stephanie if JF feels the need to wake her up, but Chakkik is the focus here.))</p>

            <p>One minute, he was falling asleep in front of his computer in the DoI&#39;s Sorting Room. The next, he was in some strange RC. Mind you, this was very lifelike for a dream. The way he was able to smell that ypur in the corner, the way he felt his long hair tied back into a ponytail, and... <br><br>He looked down.<br><br>&quot;Oh, hell no.&quot;<br><br>He took a few tentative steps in his new body. It felt all wrong, like he was wearing clothing that didn&#39;t fit him. He was a woman, and this was no dream.

Harris shuddered. No matter. He felt <i>wrong</i> in this body and he had to fix this as fast as possible. All right: plan time. First, get back to the Sorting Room. Secondly, find out what happened to his body. Thirdly, if it was still there, make sure nothing more happened to his body. Fourthly, find the author of this mix-up and fix this mess. The body-swapped Spy typed in a command into the Console&#39;s portal generator and hastily stepped through the portal to the DoI Hub, still walking stiffly. <br><br>Oh, there was going to be hell to pay for those responsible for this mess. </p>

            <p>&quot;Cupid, I think you really have to stop...&quot;<br><br>It was a teenaged Homs who spoke this, trying to console the angel he was sitting next to at Rudi&#39;s.<br><br>&quot;Why should I? Thank Palutena those fics were short, I couldn&#39;t take it anymore!&quot;<br><br>&quot;I&#39;m not happy about this either, especially not when your partner tried to use me as a sword.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Wait, she WHAT?!&quot;<br><br>&quot;No, really. She grabbed my legs and swung me around like she was crazy. I don&#39;t want you trying to do that to anyone around here, all right?&quot;<br><br>&quot;You have a problem with that?!&quot; Cupid cried, standing up. He looked at his Bleeport bottle and realized that it was empty.<br><br>&quot;I know two fics involving a literal God-Mode Harry Potter replacement were a bit much, but you need to exercise self-control.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Self control? SELF CONTROL?!&quot; He threw the now empty bottle away with a loud crashing noise. &quot;I&#39;m COMPLETELY CALM-&quot;<br><br>&quot;Okay, that&#39;s enough,&quot; Backslash said fiercely, standing up. &quot;We&#39;re going back to your RC. You need rest, and I do mean a lot of it.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yeah, I guess you&#39;re right... It&#39;s not like this day can get any worse...&quot;<br><br>All three of the Homs/Honedge&#39;s purple eyes widened in horror at this. He backed away instinctively, just as the poor angel threw up onto the floor and passed out.<br><br>Little did he know that he wouldn&#39;t be the only one to pass out...<br><br>----------<br><br>&quot;Ugh... What... Happened?...&quot; Cupid slowly opened his eyes, rubbing his head. Where was he, and what in Skyworld had happened last night? Sitting up, he brushed a lock of red hair out of his face, deciding to take a shower.<br><br>Wait, red hair? Wasn&#39;t his hair brown?<br><br>Springing to his feet, he rushed over to the mirror. A redheaded girl stared back at him, and &quot;her&quot; blue eyes widened as he realized that he was now a girl, just like in one of his previous missions. He turned away, pressing both hands to his forehead as the realization hit him.<br><br>&quot;Yeah... I think I&#39;ve had enough Bleeport for today...&quot;<br><br>----------<br><br>(Waiting now for anyone else who&#39;s in RC #2814.)</p>

            <p>...letting a little grey fox-like Pokémon scuttle into the room. Tacitus looked around at the Floating Hyacinth&#39;s office. The room was almost entirely occupied by the huge tank of water in which the Head of the Department of Floaters bobbed around. A table and two chairs were arranged right up at the edge of the tank, ostensibly allowing the Hyacinth to receive visitors. <br><br>The Zorua hopped onto the desk and whistled loudly to attract the Hyacinth&#39;s attention. Tacitus took out his writing notebook and hastily sketched a message for the Flower: &quot;Apologies for the intrusion, but are you aware that a massive body-swap event has occurred in HQ?&quot; The mute agent picked up the notebook in his teeth and held it towards the Hyacinth, hoping that the Flower would somehow read his message despite lacking anything that resembled eyes.</p>

            <p>This is a general announcement that the Body-Switch RP is <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=241484;article=5772;title=PPC%20Message%20Board">open!</a><br><br><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/135mjJwLnFIuQj_7I9y-3dNMpwRCV5BWp9UIVtW46eAI/pub">Here</a> is the opening story, because, after all, something had to have happened at the first. <br><br>And for those who haven’t seen it, the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PX71AtfFz6HkUXS4rrr8ympOR54L9N_x0X8Si8kQhy0/edit#gid=0">spreadsheet</a> is now updated with all the randomized swaps.<br><br>Characters who were <i>not</i> affected are, again, totally allowed to join in! There are plenty of reasons as to why a character would not be affected; after all, HQ is a big place and agents do go on missions! Boarders who do not yet have permission are also welcome to join in, just remember we’re keeping an eye on you. ;)<br><br>I’ll have rules reiterated in each thread as needed, but again, I’m going to emphasize the most important one: <b>Don’t break other people’s characters’ bodies.</b><br><br>And as for how the bodyswapping will work...<br><br>Characters will suddenly find themselves inhabiting the bodies of the whomever they were swapped with. This will be quite sudden and without warning. <br><br>Characters who have body-related powers will find themselves without said powers. Mental abilities will remain (except limited by the body)- psychic characters like, say, the Flowers are going to be quite displeased with the situation (not that they’d be pleased in the first place). Characters who find themselves inhabiting the bodies of characters who have powers will be able to get some very poor control over them (which could potentially be a bad thing) but will have to put quite a bit of effort into it!<br><br>If you have any further questions, feel free to ask here.<br><br>Feel free to bounce ideas and planning off in here as well among yourselves. </p>

            <p>Although he&#39;ll be controlled by Kern/Elcalion at the time. <br><br>Actually, I envision <i>Cer Fel</i> as a broadsword.

            <p>OK, a broadsword is more Skeet&#39;s style, although he&#39;s still probably going to want to try and pick up his own weapons :)<br><br>As for the eyes, Skeet was brought up as a Christian, and probably defaults to it, although he&#39;s not a particularly religious person. So I&#39;m guessing it would be very occasional flashes of blue? Would I be right in thinking that any &#39;Goddamnit&#39;s or other such minor blasphemies would result in flashes of red?

            <p>The eyes don&#39;t respond to momentary things like that; they&#39;re blue, green, or red, period. I&#39;m not quite sure if Skeet would have blue or green eyes. If, as the verse goes, he has &quot;confessed with his mouth the Lord Jesus, and believe that God has raised Him from the dead,&quot; he will have blue eyes. In Alleble, it&#39;s called making the Good Confession. <br><br>In the end, I&#39;ll leave the decision up to you; green or blue. </p>

He and Gurnirel have probably learned enough English by now to read the Words, but I doubt they use it very frequently--they rely on translators, which usually work with Sindarin (unless they don&#39;t, in which case they have to deal with that and it&#39;s amusing). What this means is that...well, Gurnirel will be very confused and Amy might have trouble pronouncing some things/find that speaking English feels a bit clumsy.<br><br>Their RC (1500) is full of plants and trees, beyond the requisite tech and weapons. I don&#39;t know if this extends to any private rooms they might have. Both of them are...I believe it&#39;s seven feet tall. Naergondir has long dark hair which he puts a lot of braids in; Gurnirel&#39;s hair is golden (she&#39;s got some Vanyarin blood) and she tends more to just braid back what&#39;s near her face. Both of them have grey eyes, and are very, very likely to be wearing elven clothes--Naergondir might well be in blue robes, Gurnirel in something dark red and slightly more practical. Once they get a translator working, she&#39;ll sound pretty formal.<br><br>They&#39;ve been friends for a very long time, and are close to the point of calling each other by words meaning &#39;sworn brother&#39; and &#39;sworn sister&#39; (as opposed to blood kin). They also have extra names which they&#39;ve given each other, such as Meldaner for Naergondir, and they tend to use them...about half the time, I think? Maybe most of the time? It&#39;s a bit hard to calculate.<br><br>Both work in SIELU, and have been agents since mid-2013.<br><br>And I think that&#39;s the entire infodump. I wouldn&#39;t mind knowing how much you and Amy know about this pair&#39;s home canon, and I should probably look up more about Amy (only her name sounds familiar, annoyingly), but this is likely more than enough to be getting on with. If I managed to miss something that you want or need to know, just ask!<br><br>~DF</p>

            <p>To you, that is.<br><br>I&#39;m definitely interested in that. I...forget exactly what I was thinking earlier today, but I&#39;m pretty sure he&#39;d be confused, worried, and probably go try to find his partner--I assume with Vania along to keep an eye on *her* partner&#39;s body. You&#39;ve certainly got a First Age Elf basically freaking out because he might be stuck as a human (who is, typically, shorter than he is).

            <p>that Amy and Gurnirel will still be in RC1500 when Naergondir and Vania get there (seeing as they&#39;re on their way now)? Cos I&#39;d be totally up for that - I think that Naergondir finding his body could be very entertaining.<br><br>- Irish </p>

            <p>Well, if you haven&#39;t found it already Amy&#39;s info can be found <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Amelia_Renner">here</a>. Although you shouldn&#39;t need too much info about Amy - these aren&#39;t straight swaps, so Naergondir hasn&#39;t ended up Amy&#39;s body, he&#39;s ended up in Doc&#39;s (just to avoid any potential confusion). <br><br>My (and therefore Amy&#39;s) knowledge of LotR is almost strictly movieverse, plus a couple of random little titbits that I&#39;ve picked up from reading missions. <br><br>And while Naergondir&#39;s vocal cords may not be used to speaking English, Amy&#39;s mind is (and she doesn&#39;t know any Sindarin at all) so I&#39;m figuring Amy-as-Naergondir will be able to speak English just fine. <br><br>I was thinking that Amy would swap in while alone in a bedroom, and her frightened yelp on realising she was in someone else&#39;s body would attract the attention of whoever was nearby. How does that sound to you?<br><br>I&#39;m getting ready to make my first RP posts, but I&#39;ve got some other stuff to take care of first. If you want to start with Gurnirel then go ahead - Amy&#39;s reaction on being spoken to by a stranger would be to give a frightened squeak and then try to hide, so I don&#39;t mind you writing those reactions if you want to get this started.<br><br>- Irish </p>

            <p>And thanks for the link. My tired self is most grateful to get to skip the simple act of searching the wiki. /sigh/<br><br>Mostly movieverse, interesting. That should be helpful for Amy (or unhelpful/frustrating, depending on what, if anything, Gurnirel references).<br><br>Alright, then. Expect startled looks from Gurnirel when the English starts--and, more importantly, when it keeps going. And swapping alone in a bedroom should work; I don&#39;t see why they wouldn&#39;t have private sleeping areas. If they don&#39;t, I can always retcon it in a mission or interlude eventually (even to the point of saying that HQ once sprouted some extra rooms for all of two months). And I think we can assume that Naergondir&#39;s sleeping; I&#39;ll probably set Gurnirel&#39;s part of the scene in the same post as her reacting to Amy, so you can be the one to start.<br><br>Also, Amy&#39;s reaction? Very much not Naergondir :D This should be <i>fun</i>.<br><br>~DF</p>

            <p>The PPC does not operate in a world of logic and sense, where the better equipped you are, the greater the odds of winning. They live in a world of Narrative, where tropes are more then observations, and what makes a good story trumps all else. Were agents to be armed to the teeth, wearing invulnerable armor, with weapons that could not break and overpower any armor, then the PPC would crumble in moments. Why? Because then Agents would be trying to be on a level playing field with Sues. And that will never happen. They bend the world to their whim. When faced with great adversaries, they always win, to make them seem more bad ass. Agents are no longer assassins, they are milestones.<br><br>So, how do we combat this? With Plot Armor, and underdog stories. The worse off it is for agents, the more endearing it is to the Narrative. The worse odds they have, the greater chance they stand. Of course, you can&#39;t walk in with absolutely nothing. That&#39;s not an underdog story, that&#39;s a suicide mission. So, we give Agents barely-working tech, that does still make their jobs much easier. We give them weapons, but only the most generic ones possible. And, best of all; we send those with wit. Agents might not be the most intelligent, or crafty, but they are all witty. They can bend Narrative in their favor, they can take advantage of their foes logical gaps to create their ultimate downfall. They can through the most painful puns. <br><br>In the end, a story of men facing gods and coming on top, is a much better narrative then unstoppable forces mowing down everything in their path. And that is not just meta commentary. It is in-universe law.</p>

            <p>So, Narav is a giant wolf-guy. He&#39;s extremely strong, and has a riiculous sense of smell - his species can sniff out bloodlines. He will probably be in his RC, perhaps working on something involving his blood magic or taxidermy.<br><br>Tera has no real voice, though she can make chirring sounds. Her eyesight involves more colors than human sight does, and she in fact has five eyes. She can also turn invisible as need be. She&#39;ll probably be in her RC, with Ari and Theia.<br><br>These two are both relatively obscure species, so feel free to ask if there&#39;s any confusion.</p>

Bosh is the one who has the know-how to use magic - while Guk has the capability, he doesn&#39;t quite have the mental fortitude or patience/interest to learn how to use it. I&#39;d say this extends to anyone in their shared body. While Bosh&#39;Guk has magical ability, you have to know how to use it in order to do anything at all. Otherwise, he&#39;s still an ogre, with all the strength that implies.</p>

            <p>And I already know that Cupid got stuck in Solvig&#39;s body... We&#39;re already trying to sort things out XD<br><br>I&#39;d provide protips for the one getting stuck in Cupid&#39;s body, but I think it was one of the Flowers who ended up having that happen to them. For reference, though, Cupid was at Rudi&#39;s at the time of the switch (right after a mission I have in the works), and he passed out like a drunkard just as it happened. Backslash will also be there, and, well... If anyone replies as the Bonsai Mallorn, you&#39;ll see soon enough. ;)</p>

            <p>BM- the characters on the list being Colt, Gerry, Denny and Rosedale- usually operates as a group out of their main RC, #20, but you can also go with them having been elsewhere at the time.<br><br>They also all carry radios for talking with other BM members by habit and Gerry in particular keeps a handgun holstered at her side. Denny and Rosedale also usually have toolbelts on them. <br><br>An important note is that Gerry&#39;s also <i>very</i> allergic to Sues! Whoever ends up in her body won&#39;t have a good time if they end up going into a Sue mission or otherwise exposed to Suvian influence.</p>
