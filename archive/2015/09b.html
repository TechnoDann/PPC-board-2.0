            <p>Since we had a Badfic Report thread last month and no Goodfic thread in sight in the top three pages, I figured it was time that we had one these again. <br><br>To start off, I have a standalone rec for The Time Traveler&#39;s Wife: <br><br><a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9035747/1/Affections-Across-Time">Affections Across Time</a> - Rated T <br><br>&quot;A series of short stories featuring different people with Chrono Displacement Disorder, and the people who care about them.&quot;  <br><br>As the summary describes, this fic switches between different arcs after each chapter, with each featuring one or more Chronologically Displaced Individual. My favorite arcs are the Phillip and Abigail one, where we get to see two children with CDD interacting with one another, and Connie and William arc, which presents a nice role reversal in relation to Henry and Clare, where its the younger one of the pair who is traveling back in time. <br><br>Then, I have a couple more for Clannad: <br><br><a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8182472/1/Whenever-You-re-Ready">Whenever You&#39;re Ready</a> - Rated T <br><br>(Warning: Contains spoiler for Clannad: After Story) <br><br>&quot;On their first night living in their new home, Nagisa tells Tomoya what she wants most of all. Oneshot. No citrus, just sweetness and emotion.&quot; <br><br><a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9966898/1/Serendipity">Serendipity</a> - Rated T <br><br>&quot;Sometimes, the small decisions we make can drastically change the course of our lives. Whether it is deciding to take a shortcut through an unfamiliar neighborhood or deciding that keeping a promise to a friend is more important than personal discomfort, actions have costs. Tomoya doesn&#39;t realize it yet, but he has made such a decision, and his life will never be the same.&quot; <br><br>Contains spoiler for Kotomi&#39;s arc. This a really nice AU where things change for the better when Tomoya remains Kotomi&#39;s best friend when the sad events of her childhood<br>happen. Very sweet and heartwarming. <br><br>And finally, courtesy of my newest fandom, Sword Art Online, I have several more. <br><br>(Since most of these either take place during episodes 11 and 12 of the anime/ Chapter 3 of Volume 2 of the Light Novel or long after them, extending to after the thereotical end of the series, SPOILERS, specially when it comes to Yui&#39;s true nature) <br><br><a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10652295/1/Yui-s-Heart">Yui&#39;s Heart</a> - Rated T <br><br>&quot;It was not time well-spent, confined to merely watching the players by Cardinal - but when two players begin to show emotions she&#39;s been longing to see, what will be her reaction?&quot;<br><br>A very well-written perspective flip. Since this is essentially Episode 11 onwards viewed throught Yui&#39;s eyes, spoiler abound here, specially since the very first scene is this story&#39;s version of a very significant scene at the end of the Epidose 12. This a very emotional read,<br>specially when comes to viewing Episodes 11, 12 and 16 throught Yui&#39;s Point Of View. <br><br><a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10339093/1/Family">Family</a>, <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10484508/1/Family-Pt-II">Family Part II</a>,<a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11477391/1/Forever">Forever</a>, <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10712061/1/A-New-World">A New World</a>, and <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10775359/1/A-New-World-Snowy">A New World: Snowy</a> - All Rated T <br><br>A five-parter series involving Kirito, Asuna and Yui finally getting to be a family in the real world. <br><br><a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10199189/1/Golden-Wishing-Clover%20">Golden Wishing Clover</a> - Rated K+ <br><br>&quot;Kirito and Asuna, still living their happy lives in SAO, ready to search for the special item that comes with the holiday. St. Patrick&#39;s Day. With the item that could grant any wish, that the rules allowed, anything could be possible. The highest rankings, weapons you&#39;d never hear of. Food! However obtaining this item would be no easy task, but Asuna will do whatever it takes.&quot; <br><br><a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10115846/1/Deus-Ex-Machina">Deus Ex Machina</a> - Rated T <br><br>&quot;One last level, one final dungeon, one ultimate boss. As enjoyable as the adventure has been, all good things must come to an end. Or do they?&quot; <br><br>A rather epic depiction of what the actual Final Boss battle at Floor 100 of Aincrad might have been like. <br><br><a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9469870/1/The-Kirita-Chronicles">The Kirita Chronicles</a> - Rated T  <br><br>&quot;What would have happened if certain characters&#39; genders were altered while others remained the same? How differently would certain events play out &amp; affect the development of certain relationships? Who will live &amp; who will die? See how the alterations of certain characters&#39; genders &amp; histories will cause ripples throughout the story&quot;<br><br>A semi-gender flip that is just the same events as in Canon but with characters&#39; gender swapped. The first five chapters alone are an expansion on the events before the first episode of SAO, involving Kirita&#39;s childhood as well actually showing what the Beta Testing of SAO was like. <br><br><a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8554699/1/The-Prince-of-Swords">The Prince of Swords</a> - Rated T <br><br>&quot;Kazuto was always exceptionally talented, but limited by his own idea of kindness. Having been corrected at an early age, he excels through life without much of a purpose. Now trapped in a rather gruesome death game of his own choice, he will attempt to break though it as Kirito, the famed Prince of Swords.&quot; <br><br>An AU where Kirito doesn&#39;t become a solo player and instead becomes a leader for the Front Lines and forms a guild with Asuna, Silica, Lisbeth and Argo. <br><br><a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9236537/1/Soul-Ablaze">Soul Ablaze</a> - Sword Art Online/Pokemon - Rated T <br><br>An AU in which the game where the Death Game takes place in Pokemon Universe, a Virtual Reality MMO where players have a mental link with their Pokemon(who have extremely advanced AIs this time around).<br><br><br>   <br><br><br><br><br><br> <br><br></p>

            <p>Trust me, I haven&#39;t got anywhere near to exhausting my stock of goodfic recs (or badfic reports for that matter). My fic related post DO tend to be on the longer side. See <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=263440;title=PPC%2520Posting%2520Board">this</a> post of mine fron back when I first joined.

            <p><a href="http://s7.zetaboards.com/Nuzlocke_Forum/topic/8876424/1/">Pokémon: Online [an emerald nuzlocke]</a> by totaldile<br><i>After two years of development, Nintendo&#39;s most anticipated project has finally been released:<br>Pokémon: Online.<br>Pokémon: Online is a virtual reality massive multiplayer online role-playing game, taking the console versions of each Pokémon game, and remodelling them into a fully immersive virtual reality environment. In addition, multiple areas of the game were modified and refined.<br>1. Pokémon now speak. They are your companions, and your friends.<br>2. Battling has become far less linear, and more like a real fight. Turn-based play is still present, but if no attack is called within 30 seconds, a new turn begins.<br>3. Trading and battles can occur anywhere, provided both Players give permission.<br>Having loved the game since they were little, Total and her best friend Brendan eagerly buy the game on it&#39;s day of launch, alongside the 500,000 other Players lucky enough to acquire a copy. As they boot up the game, the two find it to be everything they imagined.<br><br>However, this all shatters when out of the blue, they&#39;re summoned back to the Player Hub without a warning. Shocked, they are greeted with a mysterious hooded figure, who explains to them that the rules have changed.<br>The figure explains that the log out button is missing - and, that this isn&#39;t a mistake. There is no way to escape the game - removing the headset will cause it to malfunction and destroy your brain, as will manually shutting it off. The figure draws attention to the fact that not only Pokémon, but not the Players themselves have an HP bar. The figure tells us that now, when our Pokémon&#39;s HP falls to zero, they will die and be deleted from the game.<br>However, the worst thing is...<br>...that when your own HP drops to zero...<br><br>...you will die, both in and out of the game....<br><br><br>....permanently.<br><br>Welcome to Pokémon: Online.</i><br><br>It&#39;s on the Nuzlocke Forums, so there&#39;s no rating, but I&#39;d give it a high T, with some chapters skirting the line with M.<br><br>It&#39;s very well-written, and still in progress IIRC. Well worth the read.</p>

I really don&#39;t know what else to say about it. In it, Godzilla and several other kaiju have been transported to Equestria and transformed into ponies, and I honestly can&#39;t give away any more without revealing spoilers. It&#39;s dramatic, funny, reference-packed, and wonderfully written.

            <p>Doctor Who stuff, first!<br><br>Ooh, I have my absolute favorite fic <i>ever</i> to share with you lot. It&#39;s about the Seventh Doctor and Ace, and it&#39;s just so- I don&#39;t know. Perfect? Shippy? Confusing? <br>It&#39;s called <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/536826/1/Embrace">Embrace</a> and it&#39;s fairly short, so just go read it. <br><br>Um... let&#39;s see. I really love <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8484470/1/Potter-Who-and-the-Wossname-s-Thingummy">Potter Who and the Wossname&#39;s Thingummy</a> because it has time travel, references, Harry and the Doctor coexisting in one head (talking to each other in a way that makes sense) and best of all, the Slytherin Beanie Propeller Hat of Shame. It&#39;s amazing, and it will make you <i>think</i> about aspects of Harry Potter. Hard.<br><br>And here&#39;s an 11, Amy, and Rory fic that&#39;s just stunning! It&#39;s <a href="http://www.whofic.com/viewstory.php?sid=38208">Fearful Symmetry and has the best characterizations this side of canon. I can&#39;t recommend it enough, not least because it has the <s>unexpected</s>sudden appearance of one of my favorite characters ever.<br><br><br>Some non-Who stuff! <br><br>Here&#39;s a goodie. It&#39;s Artemis Fowl... and it&#39;s called </a><a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8532874/1/The-Foul-Team">The Foul Team</a>. Yeah, yeah, lame pun, but this thing is so wow I can&#39;t even manage the words to describe it. It&#39;s possibly better than the books themselves. <br><br>I&#39;m not in the Sonic fandom, but my friend recommended this one to me. I&#39;m so glad I read it. It&#39;s complete, utter crack, but it had me at &#39;the ongoing French invasion&#39; in Sonic&#39;s backyard. It&#39;s called <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4741629/1/A-Christmas-Carol">A Christmas Carol</a>.<br><br>Skulduggery Pleasant fic, because it&#39;s amazing! Here&#39;s an unfinished one, but worth a read since it&#39;s practically the only good one in the archive. <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8569792/1/Legend-of-the-Werefish"> Legend of the Werefish</a> has everything- banter, mermaids, and magic. It&#39;s written perfectly in character and is only shippy if you squint. A great missing adventure-type thing.<br><br>That&#39;s all for now. :D<br><br>~Kitty</p>

            <p>First, before I begin my review proper, it is an absolute joy to have the opportunity to read a well written piece of derivative fiction. Clear craft and care has been taken by the author to compose this short story, and in my view, it was well worth every moment. Second, I will be doing a thorough review. If you have not taken the time to read the story in question, I insist you read it before continuing, as I will be discussing critical plot points, including the ending. Assuming you have read the piece, I shall move along.<br><br>Something tells me that this is a form of personal story. While clearly the author cannot lay brush to canvas and have butterflies flutter through the air, the emotional journey Canvas goes through feels inspired by events the author has gone though themselves. I shudder to imagine what may have been the inspiration, as an asylum seems the most logical conclusion. Some of my colleagues who required mental care have spoken to me at length of the various treatments undergone inside mental care hospitals, for better or for worse. The depiction of severe retrograde amnesia is particularly vivid, and one of the great draws to this story. I am currently unaware of any procedure utilized in Equestira or World One which would produce such an effect, yet it does seem at the very least plausible.<br><br>The characterization of Canvas and Twilight Sparkle shines though. Save for one instance of Twilight using the word &quot;scum&quot; to describe the prisoners that felt far too harsh for her, she seemed truly alive and in character. You can see her transition from cold intellectual, to caring teacher, to pitying empathizer flow in a smooth, natural way. Her character journey is the set for Canvas to play on, and his performance is stellar. This poor pony has lost his very identity and though this purple visitor, he begins to find himself again, and the reality he lost. And yet, we see it come crashing down again, as even his very name is forcibly removed from his memory. It is truly crushing, and provides the main strength of the piece. For many, this will be the highlight of the story, and the reason they will recommend it so. At least, were it not for one other aspect.<br><br>Due to the nature of Canvas&#39;s story, and his rediscovery of color itself, the author has chosen to incorporate a visual nature to the text, by coloring particular words and passages. The majority of the text is white on a black background, highlighting the dual nature of Canvas&#39;s perception of the world. When he learns of a new color or feels an emotion that he associates with each color, the text changes appropriately. This use of color, providing stark contrast to the rest of the text, lets the reader feel what Canvas sees, let them experience the discovery of color. This is beautifully done, and a creative use of the digital medium.<br><br>On the whole, this is a powerful emotional journey, that pulls at the heartstrings, and makes one truly think on the nature of color. There are, however, some detractors to this story that makes me hesitate before giving grand praise. Namely, in the implications of the outside world, and the nature of the institution Canvas finds himself in.<br><br>There is a pattern within certain My Little Pony fan works that suggests (or, indeed, outright states) that Princess Celestia is far more tyrannical then one would be led to believe. While discussion on Celestia&#39;s politics is important, especially in the ways one disagrees, never has there been any evidence nor rumor of the Princess incarcerating innocents who may pose a threat to her power, nor banishment upon the slightest infraction. Why, then, do we see an institution meant to hold and &quot;correct&quot; those blessed with abilities far beyond those of the average pony? The poor foal was imprisoned at the age of eight*! He had not lived long enough to insight rebellion or pose any threat to the State. While understandable behavior in the Marvel or Detective Comics universes, it is simply horrific for any Equestrian to even imagine such a thing would occur. Speaking purely for myself, I am rather tired of this trope. Celestia is no tyrant, in the political or contemporary sense of the word. The return of Discord alone should show how merciful she is. Indeed, it is to a fault her willingness to forgive. She would be horrified by the idea of innocent ponies being tortured for the mere crime of holding grand power. The continued slander towards her name is has reached a point where I wonder what she has possibly done to earn such resentment by such a large number of the community.<br><br>However, every complaint of mine could be resolved with one simple change. Take the setting out of Equestria.  Place it in World One, have Canvas be a mutant of some form. Humans fear that which they do not understand. Many World One governments would seek to remove any perceived threat to themselves or their power quickly. Corruption and mistreatment of those who are labeled as different is well documented there. Which highlights the largest problem with the derivative story; there is no need for the use of Equestria. The only reason I can see is to use the colors of Twilight Sparkle&#39;s friends to solidify the emotional connection Canvas holds with each individual color. And yet, Canvas describes these connections so vividly, it hardly requires additional support, and where it does, the colored text provides plenty.<br><br>As a short story, I highly recommend <i>White Box.</i> It is a chilling tale of a man who has lost quite literally everything, including the very concept of color he adores so dearly. However, as a piece of derivative fiction, I cannot fully recommend it. I cannot help but feel the work would be vastly improved by making the story a piece of original fiction, and removing all ties to Equestria. Indeed, perhaps Chromosome could consider publishing the story, and earn some monetary compensation for their work.<br><br>~Printworthy<br><br>*I understand that equines in World One have far shorter lifespans then us ponies. Equestrian ponies have the same approximate lifespan as the average human.</p>

            <p>Of course, with medical being the hypercompetent place that it is, Des will be fine... but in what form?<br><br>I don&#39;t think you quite went anywhere near actual grimdark. Being cyberized seems to be quite normal for that universe, and sooner or later, it&#39;s going to happen to an agent. I think what you wrote is more like the non-action parts of an action movie--a good one, where they don&#39;t count on the special effects to carry the story. And the Librarian&#39;s predicament... well, it seems like he was quite buoyed by the sheer stupidity of his captors! Count on him to take that kind of thing as a morale boost.</p>

            <p>Yes indeed, the game where the rules are made up, and the points don&#39;t matter. Yes, like World-Jumper&#39;s writing schedule, they just don&#39;t matter. I&#39;m your host, The Host! How convenient for me. Since the last thread, we tried to get Drew Cary on board, but he said, and I quote, &quot;Oh god no, please, anything but that, don&#39;t make me go back there.&quot; So, you lot are stuck with me again.<br><br>We are playing the PPC Board version of <i>Whose Line?</i> once again, where you, yes, you, the boarders, get to have some fun with some improv and mini-roleplay. Will we play any games other then Scenes from a Hat? Probably not! But, who knows with this game. Anything can happen.<br><br>To start off, we will need some suggestions for our first game Scenes from a Hat. Here is how it will work:<br><br>The first reply to this post will be by The Hat, saying, &quot;Place Suggestions Here!&quot; You are to reply with your scenario for us to react to under the name &quot;Suggestion&quot;. Quotation marks are optional. For the title box, put &quot;Official Unofficial Suggestion&quot;. Then, to make sure nobody reads the scenario before I choose it for the game, you are to post the following, exactly, into the text box before your suggestion:<br><br>A POX ON THOSE WHO PEEK A POX ON THOSE WHO PEEK A POX ON THOSE WHO PEEK A POX ON THOSE WHO PEEK A POX ON THOSE WHO PEEK A POX ON THOSE WHO PEEK A POX ON THOSE WHO PEEK A POX ON THOSE WHO PEEK A POX ON THOSE WHO PEEK A POX ON THOSE WHO PEEK A POX ON THOSE WHO PEEK A POX ON THOSE WHO PEEK A POX ON THOSE WHO PEEK A POX ON THOSE WHO PEEK A POX ON THOSE WHO PEEK A POX ON THOSE WHO PEEK A POX ON THOSE WHO PEEK A POX ON THOSE WHO PEEK A POX ON THOSE WHO PEEK A POX ON THOSE WHO PEEK<br><br>Then, post your scenario suggestion. These can be PPC related, Real Life, fandom, whatever you want. I would highly suggest that everybody read <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ScenesFromAHat/wiki/examples#wiki_scene_prompts">This Guide from /r/ScenesFromAHat</a> before writing your prompts.<br><br>The prompts will be picked at random by me for getting posted for you all to react to, in any way you wish. Whomever has the cleverest response will receive the points for the round. If your suggestion or quip is not selected, don&#39;t take it to heart. All it means is that I probably don&#39;t like you very much.<br><br>Those are the rules, tried and true. Should we need to update the rules, I&#39;ll post an update, and curse the fact that the Board has no edit button.<br><br>Let&#39;s play!</p>

            <p>&quot;I never fit in with the other kids at school, I was such a nerd. But then one day, I fell through a hole in reality and found a secret organization, where I went on to become one of the most well-known agents within the span of a year and a half. It was during this time that I got turned into a Time Lord, and went crazy, finally snapping after the tragic death of my partner. I stole a TARDIS and ran away, only to find myself caught up in a time loop involving one of my best friends, on a planet people aren&#39;t supposed to be able to get to, and went on to illegally enlist in the military despite being much too young by my current species&#39; standards. I had to watch as all my crew members were tragically killed—WHAT DO YOU MEAN, MY GLITTER LEVEL&#39;S AT 20%?!&quot;</p>

It may not accurate be on some aspects (that whole adoption line-up thing, for example), but it is a mostly happy and safe environment and the drama mostly comes from other sources. <br><br>Or if they absolutely need to go for the &#39;Bully at the orphanage&#39; angle, there are better ways to go about it than shamelessly trying to rip our heartstrings. <br><br>Let&#39;s analyze the case of Hanako from Katawa Shoujo for a good example. <br><br>(Spoilers for Hanako&#39;s Route) <br><br>SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS <br><br> Hanako&#39;s house caught fire when she was eight. Both of her parents died, and her mother did so while shielding her from the flames with her own body. Despite that, 50%<br>of her body suffered severe burns. <br><br>After she was released from the hospital, she ended up in a orphanage. The place itself wasn&#39;t bad and the staff was really nice, but as result of her scars and the trauma she suffered, the other kids there isolated her.<br>When she went back to school, her former friends also largely ostracized her.  <br><br>In the present, she is a girl with crippling social anxiety that up until now has only ever had one friend at Yamaku. <br><br>Now that backstory is pretty terrifying and could easily make for some very cheap drama, so why is she a good example? <br><br>Precisely because the whole point of her story is that you shouldn&#39;t pity her and treat her like some broken and weak girl that always needs to be protected. If you do, if you keep acting like a White Knight despite subtle warning against, it will blow up in your face and she WILL despise you for it. <br><br>     </p>

            <p>I liked how you managed to mesh a typical American house with... working in the PPC. It was a very refreshing take.<br><br>... and now one of my Ten Years Hence-styled ideas is going to pass for stealing, as I kinda imagined that my Agents&#39; daughter would end up working in the PPC despite the fact that they left well before she was conceived.<br><br>... Ten again, the idea is so far in the making I didn&#39;t even settle on her name...</p>

            <p>There may or may not be more to Sue than is immediately evident, but I&#39;m glad you liked the combination there!<br><br>And not necessarily! Ideas all come from somewhere, and there is a limited range from which one can take them. I had some inspiration for this from the fact that hS favors the idea of having plenty of second (and later) generation agents set in future versions of the PPC; I just put a twist on it with thinking on if there had been shenanigans going on and both sides not knowing.<br><br>And yes, names are tricky.<br><br>I&#39;ve actually had the concepts for Sax and Day for a long time! I was originally, way way way back in 2008, going to do an origin comic for Cray and how she got her alligators, which was going to include the original prototypes for Sax and Day getting drafted into helping out with all of that (and it not going all that well at all).  <br><br>Thankfully for their beta versions, that never worked out, so I rehashed them for the current versions. </p>

            <p>Because there really is a fantastic broader range of reading material out there, and I can tell you from experience that it&#39;s very fun to read.<br><br>Des has already recommended Nesh&#39;s spin-off, so I&#39;ll repeat here that it is fantastic but won&#39;t include a link. Phobos&#39; work I...haven&#39;t read much of, but what little I&#39;ve read was pretty great. In fact, I just reread <a href="http://starshadowhall.tripod.com/ppc/phobos/phobos1.html">this one</a> (NSFW, it&#39;s a Bad Slash mission), and it&#39;s hilarious. So yes--seconding those.<br><br>As for some new recs: Araeph&#39;s <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Mara">Mara and Isaiah</a> are fantastic, in the Department of Technical Errors, and are probably among the first spin-offs I ever read. Looking at the wiki page, they seem to have done only (or mainly, if my eyes just skipped over something) LotR and Pirates of the Caribbean missions, but...honestly, even if those aren&#39;t your fandoms, I&#39;d still recommend them. They&#39;re amazing.<br><br>Another two, which have crossed over with each other a lot, are the spin-offs of Miah and Caddy-shack. <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Miah_Arthur">This</a> links to Agent Miah&#39;s page, and <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Maria_Nightingale">this</a> to Maria Nightingale&#39;s. I wish I could link to Cadmar&#39;s page, since he ended up being my favorite of the lot, but it&#39;s currently blank for some weird reason that I can&#39;t figure out. The pages of Agents Cali (partnered with Miah) and Maria should link to most of the stories with him, though. Miah&#39;s agents seem to be DMS, while Caddy-shack&#39;s are Floaters; and between the two of them, they&#39;ve covered a lot of canons, about half of which I&#39;m not familiar with. The characters really ended up shining; I definitely recommend these two, and, er, hope that I didn&#39;t do it too confusingly. (Also, what&#39;s up with Cadmar&#39;s page?)<br><br>Who else...hS&#39; Driftwood series is pretty great, and can be found in the &#39;Partnered with Kaitlyn&#39; section of <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Selene_Windflower">Agent Selene&#39;s</a> page.<br><br>Lily Winterwood&#39;s <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Christianne_Shieh">Christianne</a> and Eledhwen are fantastic as well.<br><br>And, certainly not least, EileenAlphabet&#39;s duo of Mittens and the <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Radioactive_Moss_Creature">RMC</a> (Radioactive Moss Creature) is hilarious.<br><br>And one more--Fish Custard&#39;s Evie and <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Fisherman">the Fisherman</a> are hands-down <i>amazing</i>. Especially Mission #6.<br><br>Beyond that--because, really, I could easily continue for several pages at this rate--I suggest checking out <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/The_Complete_List_of_PPC_Fiction">the Complete List of PPC Fiction</a>. It&#39;s not always up-to-date (looking at myself here, actually), but it&#39;s pretty extensive and goes by department. It&#39;s a fantastic place to start looking.<br><br>And beyond <i>that</i>, try using the Random Page function on the wiki (or else ask other people for recs). You&#39;ll quite likely find something new and interesting just by doing that.<br><br>Happy reading!<br><br>~DF<br><br>PS: No, seriously, what&#39;s up with Cadmar&#39;s page? Why is it blank except for the title? Does anyone know?</p>

            <p>But I really like this piece. It touches on things not a lot of PPC stories touch on — the fact that it&#39;s dangerous work; related to that, how&#39;d the agents&#39; parents react to them being agents, considering most of them are teens? And so on. Aside from that, I like the slice of life bit — it&#39;s nice to see how agents&#39; life outisde the PPC looks like.</p>

            <p>I used to do calligraphy quite a bit - I got given a set as a present when I was back in primary school. I tried my hand at the Gothic script, just because it looked cool, and I used the smallest nib and a slight italic style for my normal handwriting. <br><br>Throughout secondary school I didn&#39;t actually <i>have</i> to put my name on anything: all of my teachers said they could instantly recognise my handwriting.<br><br>As for D&amp;D, there&#39;s a very useful <a href="http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/columns/checkfortraps.3">series of articles</a> that I found when I was first starting to GM. Not all of them will be relevant, but they should be interesting. <br><br>The rulebooks give pretty solid advice for starting/running a game, although they did tend towards fairly basic &#39;dungeon crawl&#39; style games (I only have experience with 4th Ed, don&#39;t know about the rest). I&#39;d recommend starting out with a couple of simple quests along these lines (clear these caves out of monsters, escort this shiny thing through the goblin infested woods, etc.) and then try and introduce more long term plot elements once you&#39;ve got a bit of a feel for the game, and your players have a got a feel for their characters. <br><br>If the gaming group as a whole is inexperienced, then starting off with some slightly easier fights (or &#39;training fights&#39; where they&#39;re going up against people that aren&#39;t actually trying to kill them) is probably a good idea, until people get a feel for their powers and abilities. <br><br>Once you&#39;ve run a few fights, try and evaluate how well the challenge rating (or whatever they call it - the thing that tells you how many enemies you&#39;re supposed to throw against the players) is working for your group. In the last game that I ran, the players had got themselves a bunch of characters that had really good synergy, so I was doubling the recommended XP allowance of each fight just to keep things challenging for them. <br><br>Also, when it comes to the fights, I really recommend putting in environmental hazards, traps, and other interactive objects around the place, as well as the actual creatures that they&#39;ll be fighting. These can make the combats a lot more interesting.<br><br>I believe that things are different with 5th Ed, but 4th Ed&#39;s strict adherence to the grid system had a failing, in my opinion, in that the big climatic fights often felt very static. Normal fights, in which the party was typically outnumbered by two or three to one by weaker opponents would be fairly mobile - enemy spellcasters would start at range and have a wall of meatshields in front of them so that they could stay at range, and the players would defeat one enemy then run on to the next. It felt dynamic, and you might have to deal with cover / line of sight / difficult terrain issues as you moved on. &#39;Boss fights&#39;, typically against one large and powerful adversary with maybe a few (much) weaker minions, tended to be much more static. You&#39;d spend the first turn or two getting into attack position, and then you&#39;d just start chipping its health away. Until someone got very low on health, there wasn&#39;t really anything else to do. <br><br>This was somewhat exaggerated in our case, as the setting the DM had created meant that we were short on magic users, but long on melee types, so once we got into position around a big target we basically had it surrounded so it couldn&#39;t go anywhere (and we didn&#39;t want to go anywhere, or we&#39;d be out of range). Still, D&amp;D remains the only game where I&#39;ve been bored while fighting a dragon. <br><br>Having things like pendulum traps swinging through the fight area can help make things a little less static. <br><br>If you&#39;ve got any specifying questions about DMing I&#39;ll be happy to share my thoughts. <br><br>- Irish</p>

            <p>I&#39;ll answer your last question first, because it&#39;s quicker: I&#39;ve never played Pathfinder before, so of those two I can only really recommend D&amp;D 4th Ed. Having said that, if you&#39;d just asked me what game I recommended from  my personal experience, 4th Ed is probably the one that I&#39;d pick. It&#39;s a nice simple system, and the rulebooks fully cover most of the situations you can expect to find yourself in. It&#39;s also very clear in terms of what actions you&#39;re allowed to take, and what the consequences are. This applies both to the players and the DM - it&#39;s a very good intro system (basically agreeing with what Iximaz said). <br><br>However, because of the way the system works, you will need access to the Player&#39;s Handbook in order to do character creation (and levelling up). <br><br>I&#39;m unfamiliar with the acronym BBEG, but a quick Googling leads me to think it stands for Big Bad Evil Guy. If, however, you meant it to mean something else, then my following advice will be near-useless :)<br><br>Well, <a href="http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/tabletop/checkfortraps/7666-Adversaries-Are-Made-of-People">this</a> Check for Traps article touches on how to run villains, and <a href="http://www.giantitp.com/articles/rTKEivnsYuZrh94H1Sn.html">this</a> article from the Giant in the Playground gaming forums covers actually creating antagonists (I personally found this one very useful). <br><br>I can&#39;t really offer much in the way of specific advice, because the nature of a truly great (or should that be <i>evil</i>) villain should be tied to the story - a story about a group of adventurers slaughtering their way through the Unnamed Evil Lord&#39;s horde of 10,000 orcs before finally stealing his Ominous Helmet of Doom and kicking his teeth in, is going to have a very different Big Bad to a story about the political intrigue in the kingdom, where it eventually turns out that the Grand Vizier was the one behind all the assassination attempts, and probably shouldn&#39;t marry the princess after all. <br><br>In general, you want your villain to be memorable, which usually means giving them a distinctive appearance and maybe some unique abilities, and you probably want them to be physically powerful. While the &#39;Puppet Master&#39; types can make for very good villains, they also tend not to be as satisfying to beat. So even if your plot does have them as a mastermind, try and make sure they&#39;re good in a brawl too (or at the very least employ competent bodyguards). <br><br>Related to the character themselves being distinctive, it can also be useful to give them (and by extension, their minions) some kind of symbol. It can be a coat-of-arms, a pin badge or a tattoo - anything really - but a nice visual identifier that an average looking guy is actually aligned with the Big Bad can be useful. It can be used to add plot hooks, or raise the tension of a scene - imagine the characters get dragged out of their beds and arrested on trumped up charges; they&#39;re all confused as to what is happening, but then one of them spots the captain of the guard is leering at them unpleasantly, and has a familiar looking tattoo...<br><br>Coming up with names is one of the aspects of character creation that I find hardest, and I know a lot of other people feel the same. Coming up with a name for a villain is especially tricky, because the players will probably be hearing it quite a lot. My advice is to keep it short (or at least have it be easily shortenable): Mitth&#39;raw&#39;nuruodo may be perfectly in keeping with the naming conventions of your villain&#39;s species, but if your players can&#39;t remember it, then name-dropping the villain isn&#39;t going to have much impact. <br><br>Particularly with D&amp;D, with its very rigid class and levelling system, you&#39;re also going to want to think about what sort of level your characters will be when they face this guy. The sort of adversary that will prove a challenging final fight for a group of lvl 20s will be capable of utterly devastating a part of lvl 10s, and will drop in seconds to a party of lvl 30s.<br><br>You may also need to give some thought to what your party is like in terms of abilities - you want your villain to be challenging, but not impossible to defeat. If your party consists entirely of mundane weapon users, you probably shouldn&#39;t make your villain immune to everything but magical damage. <br><br>If you want it, I&#39;d be perfectly happy to try and give you more specific advice on your particular bad guy, but I&#39;ll need to get some more info on your intended setting/storyline. <br><br>- Irish</p>

            <p>Those articles are <i>perfect</i>. Thank you!<br><br>I haven&#39;t found a name yet, so I&#39;ll just call him &quot;the King.&quot; It actually won&#39;t be too hard for me to find names; I&#39;m taking a page out of C.S. Lewis&#39;s book and borrowing from Turkish (&quot;aslan&quot; is the Turkish word for lion). The name of my currently-vague world is &quot;Arev,&quot; which is just the word for &quot;flame,&quot; and consists of six regions numbered one through six, again, in Turkish. The adventurers start out in the first region, Tek, which is devoted to agriculture. And they have the misfortune of being in the most agriculturally agriculturest town in Tek-- Barlan. <br><br>The King makes more sense if I explain how his kingdom works as well, so I hope you don&#39;t mind a bit of exposition...<br><br>Basically, the six regions are arranged in a circle around the central kingdom, which I don&#39;t have a name for yet. The regions are strictly regimented by class and status; Tek is the lowest, consisting mostly of farmers, and is the butt of all jokes in the kingdom. Barlan is the butt of all jokes in Tek, so the PCs are off to a brilliant start. Everything in Arev is tied to your standing-- a combination of wealth, prestige, bravery, and all other aspects of notability. If you want to move into the next region, you have to get a certain level of standing (XP) and get a writ of permission from that region&#39;s noble. You can only move up clockwise in this fashion, and only members of the sixth region, Altı (which I&#39;ll probably change to something more phonetic; it&#39;s pronounced &quot;Alt-uh,&quot; with an emphasis on the &quot;a&quot; and a slightly long &quot;l&quot; sound) can go to the central city. <br><br>Now, the King. He&#39;s an illegitimate son of the last king, and his mother was from Barlan. It&#39;s been constantly hung over his head his whole life that he&#39;s from lowly Tek, and, worse yet, from Barlan. He utterly loathes the region, and wants to sweep it off of the map, so his main emotions are Shame and Resentment. The Fire King character has largely influenced his plan; he wants to turn all of the other regions against Tek, and eventually provoke outright war. He&#39;s already started sowing seeds of strife, mainly amongst the higher nobles in the central city. <br><br>I&#39;d like some advice on how to present him. I want him to evoke some measure of pity, but also fear, since he&#39;s completely willing to kill thousands of people just to get rid of this shame. I&#39;m not exactly a six foot something muscular dude with a deep voice; how should I roleplay this guy to make him seem threatening, without it coming off as silly? <br><br>Thank you so much for the advice!

            <p>How do I play someone that&#39;s so different from me? That applies to both players and DMs, although DMs tend to get it worse due to the fact that they may have to play several recurring characters. <br><br>Unfortunately most of the advice I can offer boils down to &#39;try it out and see how you do&#39;.<br><br>For recurring characters like this I&#39;ll tend to make up some cue cards that I can refer to that give a quick summary of what the character is like, including things like speech patterns (so for a royal it might include something like &#39;always uses the Royal &quot;we&quot; when speaking about himself&#39;, as well as any other features that would make him distinctive. Then I can at least play them consistently. <br><br>And that&#39;s one of the key things, I think, about playing a character. You don&#39;t necessarily have to have them speak exactly as you imagine them to, as long as they are speaking in a distinctive manner. If you can&#39;t get your voice as deep as you think the guy should be, don&#39;t worry - but if you can use a deeper-than-normal voice whenever you speak as him, then your players will probably pick up on it. <br><br>Also, you can use narration to make him come across however you want, even if you can&#39;t do the actual voice yourself. If my players had just screwed up doing a task for the king, I might say to them &#39;The King strides into the room, flanked by muscular guards. &quot;What is the meaning of this?&quot; he demands. His deep, booming voice echoes around the throne room.&#39;. It works even if you don&#39;t put on a voice, although it works better if you can put one on. <br><br>Also, there is one final link that I think may be of use to you. Probably the biggest problem about DMing is that it&#39;s very hard to actually learn from someone - as a player you&#39;re generally focusing what your character is / will be doing, and won&#39;t be able to pay much attention to how the DM is actually running the game, instead you&#39;ll be listening to them as they tell you what&#39;s going on. And as a new DM you&#39;ll probably find you&#39;re concentrating on telling the players what they need to know to, and aren&#39;t able to spend the time to analyse what you&#39;re doing and how well it&#39;s going.  <br><br>So here is the link to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asPwTthfJFk&amp;list=PLV_qemO0oatgObLdo4SNEtC8PUQMblhQs">Temple of the Lava Bears</a>, a video series on youtube of a D&amp;D campaign. I found it very entertaining to watch, and it&#39;s also the only time I&#39;ve actually been able to watch how a DM is actually DMing, rather than paying attention to what they were saying about those goblins trying to sneak up on our flank. These guys do a bunch of comedy videos, so I already sort of knew who they all were before I started watching this, which I think made it more interesting for me (I&#39;ve tried watching videos posted by other gaming groups, but just couldn&#39;t get into them). So yeah, you might find that it&#39;s too boring to watch through. On he other hand, if you do find it interesting, you might be able to pick up some more tips and tricks. <br><br>- Irish</p>

            <p>I&#39;m really interested in these videos. I&#39;ve been listening to a D&amp;D campaign podcast, and that&#39;s been fun, but it&#39;ll be even better to actually see the people as they play. <br><br>I think the distinctiveness of a character will help me a lot; like you said, even if it&#39;s not exactly as I imagine it, my players will get the right idea.<br><br>Oh, I had another question-- how do I handle maps? I was under the impression that the entire group used a large map detailing the entire area and moved their tokens across it; is that correct? My DM Guide seems to be saying that I&#39;m the only one with a complete map, while my players have a blank grid used only for keeping track of where their characters are when necessary. <br><br>Thank you so much for helping me out; you&#39;ve been invaluable!<br><br>-Alleb</p>

            <p>(Warning, incoming wall o&#39;text detected)<br><br>OK, so I&#39;ve said a lot of stuff, and it&#39;s all just my opinion based on my own experiences. If you find another way that works for you, that&#39;s the one you should use.<br><br>Well, the typical situation would be that your group all gathers round at someone&#39;s (usually the DM&#39;s, but not always) house, and you all sit round a big table. <br><br>There&#39;s a map in the middle that everyone can see, and the DM has a little corner/end of the table sectioned off by the DM Screen which conceals all of the detailed notes that you can&#39;t allow the players to see. This would usually include a map of your own, which will be smaller in scale, but far more detailed. <br><br>I realise this won&#39;t be quite the set-up that you&#39;ll have, as you&#39;ve said you&#39;re getting the group together virtually, but you should be able to work on a variation of it. <br><br>Your secret map should contain all of the information that you need to run the encounter: a full layout of the building/cave network/forest clearing/whatever that the players are exploring, with starting positions for all the monsters/creatures/NPCs, and the positions of any traps/treasure/items of interest. Next to that you&#39;re going to want some notes about the area. If it&#39;s a particularly important/impressive area you might want to start with a brief paragraph giving a description of the place. Your notes should also contain quick references for any rolls that might need to occur, for example a list of the DC ratings for Perception Checks to spot any traps. I also tend to have a separate sheet for all adversary combat stats (starting Hit Points, AC, Attack Rolls + Damage, etc.) - you can just refer to the page(s) of the Monster Manual, but if you&#39;ve got a bunch of different creatures then you&#39;re going to be forever flicking back and forth. <br>You&#39;ll also want a space somewhere (again, I tend to use a separate sheet) for recording the Initiative Order, and the current health of monsters. <br><br>In comparison, the map available to your players should really only contain the information that would be available to their characters (but is a lot more than just a blank grid). For example, your map may show that they are in a room, with a corridor leading off it, and two ogres waiting just the other side of the door, ready to bash the head in of the first person to open the door. The players&#39; map will show that they are in a room, with a closed door at the far end. Your notes may then have the DC check required for the players to hear the ogres before they open the door. <br><br>Theoretically, the players&#39; map should only cover information that their characters know, so in the case of a room with closed doors there shouldn&#39;t be any lines beyond them until the players open the door, and then you can reveal the room/corridor/whatever. In practise, this will slow the encounter down a lot, and mean that you are constantly re-drawing things. The more practical solution is to map the full layout of the area, but only as far as things like walls and doors go. Internal detail, such as monsters, weird symbols on the floor, sacrificial alters, the bones of a previous adventuring group, etc. will only be added once someone can draw line of sight to them. <br><br>Also, if you&#39;ve got a big area that you want them to explore, don&#39;t be afraid to split it up into several sections, and separate maps for each section. <br><br>Also also, most of the powers/abilities that the characters will have will be given a range measured in grid squares. If you&#39;re running a combat/puzzle encounter (really any encounter other than a conversation/social interaction), then it will be necessary to keep track of where everyone is. This isn&#39;t true for every game system, but I think it&#39;s very true for D&amp;D 4th Ed. <br><br>So, how to adapt all that to your situation?<br><br>Well, if your group is going to be a mix of those physically present in front of you and those virtually present, then you&#39;ll want the big player&#39;s map. <br><br>But for those that will be present virtually, however many that is, you need to find a way to get the map information to them. Players only really have two ways of receiving information about the situation their characters are in: what you tell them, and what the map shows them. <br><br>You&#39;re still going to want to have two maps: one for them and one for you, but if they are all going to be virtual presences keeping your one secret won&#39;t be much of a challenge. <br><br>The difficulty is going to be in getting the players&#39; map to them. There is <a href="https://roll20.net/">&#39;virtual tabletop&#39;</a> software available that will allow you to do this. I believe some of them are even available for free. However, I have never used any of them, so I can&#39;t tell you exactly how they work or how good they are. <br><br>My group has used a couple of techniques before, which worked (although not as well as just getting everyone together). <br><br>The first is that the DM sets up a physical table, with a webcam pointed at it. The players can ask for the viewpoint to be moved during their turn, and tell the DM where they want to move to (move my paladin 3 paces forward and 1 to the right). The DM is basically in charge of the board, and moves things at the request of the players. This has the advantage of being unambiguous - if you see the DM moving your piece different to how you intended, you can correct them (or correct yourself if you said the wrong thing), and everyone is looking at exactly the same thing. The downside of this is bandwidth/connection quality - it may or may not be practical for you all. <br><br>The other option is that the DM prepares the players&#39; map(s) in advance, either drawing them out by hand or sketching on computer, and e-mails them out to the players. If you&#39;ve got several maps you&#39;ll have to give them titles so that your players will know which ones to refer to (and make sure you don&#39;t give anything away with the title - no point in naming it &#39;Goblin Ambush&#39;, even if that is a nice summary of the intended encounter). You&#39;ll also need to give actual grid-references, so that you all have a common point of reference for the map. Each individual is then responsible for updating the position of all characters/monsters/etc. on their own map. The advantage of this is that it can be co-ordinated via audio only, there&#39;s no need to set up an additional webcam and work out how to get it aimed at the game board properly. The disadvantage is that your games inevitably turn into some weird hybrid of D&amp;D and Battleships, which can make co-ordinated tactics like distractions and flanking manoeuvres more tricky than they need to be. As the DM, it will also be your responsibility to resolve any issues that occur as a result of people being in the wrong place.   <br><br>One thing you will have to watch out for is making sure that everyone gets to have a say in discussions. This was a bigger problem in my group, because we&#39;ve generally only had one person gaming remotely - and it was very easy for the group around the table to forget about, or talk over, our not-so-absent friend (on one memorable occasion our <i>DM</i> that was the one virtual person, and two of the players got into an argument with each other about something that the DM was trying to clarify, but they were ignoring him because he couldn&#39;t turn his speakers up, whereas they could just talk louder to drown out the &#39;distraction&#39;). <br><br>Making sure that they get their fair share of time in combat is easy enough - the initiate mechanic basically forces it, but if you get a few people together chances are one of them will be a little quieter than the others. My advice is to work out who this is, and then try and listen out for them: if the group is having a big discussion and they don&#39;t seem to be part of it, specifically ask them for their opinion on the matter. <br><br>Seeing as this topic is about drop off the front page, my e-mail address is <a href="mailto:samurai_ireland@hotmail.com">samurai_ireland@hotmail.com</a> - if you have any more questions you can contact me there. <br><br>- Irish</p>

            <p>The philosophy of less is more.  If you want someone to be terrifying, keep him in the back.  Never actually making appearances.  Use the stories of the people suffering under him to build his ethos.  Show the fear and desperation of Tek&#39;s people.  But do not show your villain.  Let your players imagination fill in the blanks.  <br><br>That might be the best way to get fear and sympathy.  Have NPC&#39;s explain the background.  Have them tell his story, but you show the effects.  <br><br>Just my two cents, but seeing as I have never played anything like D&amp;D take it for what you will. </p>

            <p>Yes, the grid-based combat is a bit static, but the visual aid is pretty useful for newcomers, and the At-Will, Encounter, and Daily power divide is a lot easier for newcomers to understand compared to spell slots. ^^;<br><br>Also, you might want to consider picking up the PHB, because there are a lot of rules of combat in there, like line of sight and grappling and the like, that aren&#39;t in the DM&#39;s guide or aren&#39;t explained as extensively. Might seem weird, but the publishers assume you&#39;ll buy them all together. :P</p>

            <p>It&#39;s been a good while since I played D&amp;D (back when 3.5 Edition was still relatively newish, which tells you how long it&#39;s been), and I was mainly one of the adventurers. I&#39;ve been contemplating becoming a DM as well, actually, since I prefer being the storyteller than the reactive player. <br><br>I&#39;d say find the rule version you&#39;re most comfortable with and go from there. Study published modules and the core rulebooks. You can find quite a lot of them online in PDF form for free or relatively cheap, so you shouldn&#39;t have to shell out much if any money for them.</p>

            <p>Well, it&#39;s slightly thicker paper - you might have noticed your ink bleeding through your notebook, which you obviously don&#39;t want! My paper is parchment-coloured, because that&#39;s pretty, but ultimately, any paper will do.<br><br>Hilariously, I got interested in it while working at a charity shop: we had a 1930s encyclopaedia with a section on German (the language), which included a full-page image of the Gothic lettering then still in use across Germany.

            <p>Okay, you&#39;re probably expecting me to say that about everything you do by now, but this is more specific:<br><br>You were wrong to say that <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/general-election-2015/politics-blog/11675756/The-lunatic-wing-of-the-Labour-Party-is-still-calling-the-shots.html">Labour didn&#39;t really want to elect Jeremy Corbyn as its leader</a>. You were wrong - and yes, I&#39;m including the Labour right-wing here - to say that <a href="http://www.alastaircampbell.org/blog/2015/08/10/nice-guy-good-mp-making-the-weather-but-it-has-to-be-abc-anyone-but-corbyn-labour-is-finished-if-he-wins/">they should vote for &#39;Anyone But Corbyn&#39;</a>. You were wrong, and a <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/ng-interactive/2015/sep/14/jeremy-corbyns-victory-speech-what-he-said-what-he-meant">landslide victory for Corbyn</a> proves it.<br><br>I can understand <i>why</i> you were wrong, why you felt that right-wing thinking is the default for Britain&#39;s electorate. We&#39;ve had a rough few decades on the Left - twenty years of a Conservative Thatcher/Major government, followed by Blair gaining power for Labour by moving dramatically to the right; then in 2010 the &#39;other Left party&#39;, the Lib Dems, went into coalition with the Right, and in 2015, the traditionally left-wing Scotland voted Nationalist instead, and a massive proportion of English voters went for Racist Far-Right.<br><br>But you were wrong. 60% of the Labour party just told you you&#39;re wrong: they elected the leftmost candidate they could to head up Her Majesty&#39;s Opposition. When you look across the floor of the House of Commons - or when you look down from the Labour back benches - it&#39;s a proper left-wing Opposition leader you&#39;ll be looking at.<br><br>I have no idea whether Jeremy Corbyn can win the election for Labour in 2020; it&#39;s a long five years we&#39;ve got ahead of us, with UKIP still looming over us, and the SNP unlikely to let go of Scotland. But I do know this: for the first time since I started paying attention to politics, over a decade ago, one of the two major parties has a leader I <i>want</i> to see as PM.<br><br>hS<br><br>PS: Also, it&#39;s absolutely <i>hilarious</i> that one of Labour&#39;s biggest mavericks and leadership-defiers is now in charge. I can&#39;t wait to see what happens next. ^_^</p>

            <p>Can anybody adequately explain why on earth Anarchism is Absolute Left? Isn&#39;t the Right supposed to be &quot;A man is entitled to the sweat of his brow, not to anyone but himself and his own,&quot; and liberalism being, &quot;From each according to his ability, to each according to his need,&quot; and all that jazz? So, shouldn&#39;t &quot;No government, no law, man can care for themselves,&quot; be Absolute Right? I mean, I don&#39;t know about you, but it just seems backwards to me.

            <p>From the site:<br><i> If we recognise that [the traditional designations of Left and Right] is essentially [on] an economic line it&#39;s fine, as far as it goes. We can show, for example, Stalin, Mao Tse Tung and Pol Pot, with their commitment to a totally controlled economy, on the hard left. Socialists like Mahatma Gandhi and Robert Mugabe would occupy a less extreme leftist position. Margaret Thatcher would be well over to the right, but further right still would be someone like that ultimate free marketeer, General Pinochet.<br><br>That deals with economics, but the social dimension is also important in politics. That&#39;s the one that the mere left-right scale doesn&#39;t adequately address. So we&#39;ve added one, ranging in positions from extreme authoritarian to extreme libertarian.<br><br>Both an economic dimension and a social dimension are important factors for a proper political analysis. By adding the social dimension you can show that Stalin was an authoritarian leftist (i.e. the state is more important than the individual) and that Gandhi, believing in the supreme value of each individual, is a liberal leftist. While the former involves state-imposed arbitrary collectivism in the extreme top left, on the extreme bottom left is voluntary collectivism at regional level, with no state involved.<br><br>...<br><br>[D]espite popular perceptions, the opposite of fascism is not communism but anarchism, and that the opposite of communism (i.e. an entirely state-planned economy) is neo-liberalism (i.e. extreme deregulated economy)</i><br><br><br>And thus the disconnect is resolved.</p>

            <p>I find it very interesting how you people from the UK absolutely despise Margaret Thatcher. Now, my great-aunt (at least, I think that&#39;s how we&#39;re related) is from Scotland, so I have had these disagreements with her on these topics already. I&#39;m not interested in hearing anything about British politics (no offense, but I&#39;m from America, so why should I care?), but I just find it so interesting how much you people seem to just hate Thatcher, and Blair, and Cameron. I&#39;m speaking from ignorance here, but it&#39;s my opinion that maybe, possibly, a little bit, they all deserve a bit more credit than they get. <br><br>Just from an academic standpoint, of course. That&#39;s all I&#39;m saying.<br><br>Also, this entire topic is green lit by the PPC Constitution, right? Just making sure. Don&#39;t want any undue controversy here, am I right?</p>

            <p>So long as everyone behaves and doesn&#39;t aim any particular insults at each other, I&#39;ll not be having to be doing any biting. *wide grin*<br><br>The thing with Thatcher is she is very, very much a point of division because she was a very, very terrifyingly amazingly active lady when it came to making things happen. She was called the Iron Lady for a reason. She was also rather Conservative, and the leader of said UK party back in the 80s.<br><br>In a lot of ways (and not necessarily the best of) she was basically the UK&#39;s Reagan, with all the implications thereof. <br><br>As for Blair and Cameron, it&#39;s just part of the fact they&#39;re both relatively recent politicians, and we can still see a lot of the effects from how modernization and technology has changed politics and how we perceive things with the beginning of Blair&#39;s time in office. (Sorry, Brown, there&#39;s not much room for interest in you, here).<br><br>You can see the same thing that Blair and Cameron get with Clinton, Bush, and Obama on our side of the ocean. <br></p>

            <p>Which means I assume for the most part Conservative/Right leaning Brits will probably love her, but the left leaning ones, which to me it seems the majority of our British Boarders, and I would say all boarders, will have a differing opinion.<br><br>I will be interested to see the chart of leanings that I think hS is putting together.

            <p>I think the British left-wing made a mistake. I don&#39;t know what Corbyn&#39;s opinions on internal British matters are — and, for that matter, I don&#39;t have an opinion on internal British matters anyway — but his foreign policy ideas are disastrous. That&#39;s the guy who called HAMAS and Hizballah his friends, and, frankly? Hamas and Hizballah are terrorist organisations, they shoot civilians on purpose, Hizballah helps the murderous Assad regime, and the list goes on and on.<br>As to his talk of addressing them as friends because a peace process needs to involve them: a) you make peace with enemies, not friends; b) no peace process needs to involve Hizballah because they&#39;re not Palestinians and they&#39;re not the government of Lebanon; and c) HAMAS needs to change a couple things — like, y&#39;know, recognising Israel&#39;s right to exist — before it can be part of any peace process. Toning down the &#39;kill all Israelis&#39; propaganda would be nice but is less important.</p>

            <p>Seriously, the good ol&#39; US of A supported the Khmer Rouge. If you don&#39;t know who they are (most people around my area didn&#39;t) you should look them up. Just avoid Google image searches, unless you want to see what they did to people. Foreign policy around the globe has always been a game of agenda pushing and behind-the-scenes politicking. Not going to say &#39;get used to it&#39; but politics are a really ugly business. I&#39;m not even really trying to explain that to you, just complaining.<br><br>I agree with you on the matter of supporting groups who shoot civilians. Groups who do that for no good reason are little more than organized crime, in my opinion, not even terrorists. One man&#39;s terrorist can be another man&#39;s freedom fighter (Not often, but sometimes), but the instant a group decides to add innocents to their list of targets, they have lost all honour and respect in my eyes.<br><br>This guy could be good for Britain, but I don&#39;t know much about his foreign policies. Hopefully, he drops his support for these groups. I&#39;d hate for an otherwise good (by politician standards) system to need to involve supporting groups like this. No good can come of it. Funny, I hate politicians, yet I might end up as one.</p>

            <p>Corbyn&#39;s response on the issue, cited from <a href="http://www.express.co.uk/news/politics/590998/Jeremy-Corbyn-Hamas-Hezbollah-friends-comments-Channel-4">here</a> (the Express is a supporter of the nationalist/racist party UKIP), and repeated <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/labour/11737466/Labour-leadership-hopeful-Jeremy-Corbyn-loses-his-cool-over-friendship-with-Hamas.html">here</a> in a different order (the Telegraph is a supporter of the Conservative Party).<br><br><i>&quot;I spoke at a meeting about the Middle East crisis in parliament and there were people there from Hezbollah and I said I welcomed our friends from Hezbollah to have a discussion and a debate, and I said I wanted Hamas to be part of that debate. I have met Hamas in Lebanon and I&#39;ve met Hezbollah in this country and Lebanon.<br><br>&quot;I&#39;m saying that people I talk to, I use it in a collective way, saying our friends are prepared to talk.<br><br>&quot;Does it mean I agree with Hamas and what it does? No. Does it mean I agree with Hezbollah and what they do? No. What it means is that I think to bring about a peace process, you have to talk to people with whom you may profoundly disagree.<br><br>&quot;There is not going to be a peace process unless there is talks involving Israel, Hezbollah and Hamas and I think everyone knows that.&quot;</i><br><br>And my responses, for the sake of... y&#39;know, responses:<br><br>-We had people from Hezbollah in the Houses of Parliament? That&#39;s kind of scary. I hope that they were from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hezbollah">the political wing, rather than the proscribed-as-a-terrorist-group militant side</a>. (I believe we made the same distinction between militant and political sides in the case of Northern Ireland, though I may be mistaken.)<br><br>-I disagree vehemently that Hezbollah and especially Hamas are in any way friendly. I <i>have</i> heard the word used in the way Corbyn seems to be saying he meant it - &#39;we have friends in the Soviet government (say), and they&#39;re willing to talk [and take what we say back to their unfriendly superiors]&#39; - but I&#39;m not convinced he was using it that way.<br><br>-The three ways to get peace seem to be: extermination or removal of one side; complete suppression of one side, including total disarmament and removal of all political authority; negotiated peace between the two sides. I think I&#39;m right in saying most people would <i>like</i> the last? But...<br><br>-I don&#39;t see Hamas, in particular, as being willing to negotiate any peace that doesn&#39;t involve one of the first two options. If Corbyn thinks they will, he&#39;s fooling himself.<br><br>I maintain that Corbyn was the best choice for leader of the Labour Party, and best choice on the menu for Prime Minister. But on the issue of Israel and its environs, he is naive at best, foolish at middlest, and downright deluded at worst.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>(Responding now that I&#39;m a) calm and b) not dead tired.)<br><br>-From this quote I gather that he thinks a peace process must happen. While I don&#39;t disagree in principle, now is simply not the time.<br>I also object to the inclusion of Hizballah, which has no place in any sort of peace talks, whether with the Palestinians (it&#39;s a Lebanese organisation) or the Lebanese (it&#39;s not the government; also, terrorist organisation).<br>Also, as I&#39;ve already said — HAMAS needs to change before it can be a part of any sort of peace process.<br><br>-I can&#39;t find any trace of Hizballah representatives visiting the British parliament, so it might be that his &#39;invitation&#39; was shot down.<br>-That said, making a distinction between Hizballah&#39;s &quot;political wing&quot; and &quot;military wing&quot; is nonsensical. The &quot;political wing&quot; must know and approve (at least by silence, though I doubt that&#39;s the case) about the &quot;military wing&#39;s&quot; ideology and methods; ergo, they&#39;re cut from the same stock and are just as bad. Dealing with them is no different than dealing with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mustafa_Badr_Al_Din">Mustafa Badr Aldin</a>.<br><br>-If Corbyn&#39;s the best option for PM Britain has, the United Kingdom is in a sorry state indeed; I&#39;d even hazard a leap of faith and say it&#39;s in a worse state than Israel (and we had three consecutive Bibi governments).</p>

That said, I&#39;m not aware of any <b>other</b> times that&#39;s worked, so you probably have a point. ^<em>^<br><br>-The alternatives to Corbyn are:<br>--The current Conservative PM, who is in the middle of gleefully selling off chunks of the National Health Service (because businesses with their eye on the profit margins are <i>clearly</i> the best people to be caring for the sick), shutting down libraries (because all the people worth thinking about can afford to buy books), making universities much more expensive (so that all those poor people don&#39;t get ideas above their station), and so on and so forth.<br>--Our third party is currently the SNP, a national party whose platform is entirely focussed on Scotland, whose leader is not in the House of Commons, and who, by virtue of only standing in Scotland, are literally incapable of getting a majority.<br>--Our <i>fourth</i> party are the ones who completely betrayed their voter base and formed a coalition with the Conservatives last time round, revealing that they have exactly no principles.<br>-Then we have a couple of Irish and Welsh parties.<br>-Then we have the got-the-third-most-votes-but-only-one-seat nationalist/racist UKIP, whose platform is &#39;get out of Europe and get rid of brown people&#39;.<br>-Then we have the Green party, who are perfectly lovely, but only have one seat.<br><br>So yeah. Up until the 12th, we didn&#39;t have a functioning Left Wing in Britain. We had a &#39;slightly less right wing&#39;. I&#39;ve no idea if that&#39;s worse than what&#39;s going on in Israel, but it&#39;s been pretty awful.<br><br>hS<br><br>(PS: Again purely for information, the division of Hezbollah into &#39;one terrorist group, one political wing&#39; was &lt;a href=&quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hezbollah#Designation">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hezbollah#Designation</a></em>as<em>a</em>terrorist<em>organization</em>or<em>resistance</em>movement&quot;&gt;put in place in 2008 by the Labour government, and maintained under the Conservatives of the last five years</a>. It&#39;s also in accordance with the official opinion of the EU. I have no idea how Mr. Corbyn views the matter.)</p>

            <p>Basically, going through a peace process now can be likened for a teacher telling two kindergärtners to be friends of each other, despite having had a fight not a moment ago. What we need now are trust-building steps — a halt on one-sided actions, the PA stopping its support of stone and Molotov cocktail terrorism, Israel&#39;s police actually starting to police the settlers, etc.<br><br>Misc. responses to the misc. responses:<br><br>-The IRA is similar to the homegrown terrorists we had back before Independence. It is/was <i>not</i> a religiously-motivated organisation. What&#39;s more, in Hizballah&#39;s case, there&#39;s a legitimate government in Lebanon. There&#39;s <i>no</i> reason to talk to Hizballah.<br><br>-That sounds like what we have here:<br>--Likud, Bibi&#39;s party, which is... either right-wing or &#39;stay in power&#39;, IDK (coalition).<br>--Kulanu, supposedly a &#39;social&#39; party; their track record, especially considering the use of the gas fields offshore, is eh. Right-wing politically (their head, Kahlon, used to be a Likud MK). (coalition)<br>--The Jewish Home, nasty right-wing religious nutjobs (coalition).<br>--Shas, Mizrakhi religious fanatics (coalition).<br>--United Torah Judaism, Ashkenazi religious fanatics (coalition).<br>--Zionist Union, which consists of the local Labour party and Tzipi Livni&#39;s party. Supposedly centre-left, they have some good MKs (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mickey_Rosenthal">Mickey Rosenthal</a>, for example) and a horde of spinless cowards and idiots (Merav Michaeli, I&#39;m looking at you here). (opposition)<br>--The Joint List, which is basically all the Arab parties and Khadash (communists and Arabs) combined into one (opposition).<br>--Yesh Atid, which is Yair Lapid&#39;s party. Centrist-ish. Their cred isn&#39;t too good.<br>--Yisrael Beitenu, crazy Russian right wing. Really corrupt, too (opposition).<br>--Meretz, loony left. The defeatist &quot;we&#39;re eviiiiiiiil we must punish ourself&quot; claptrap guys.<br><br>So all of our parties suck, basically.<br><br>(That division, as I&#39;ve said, is claptrap.)</p>

Which would, yes, include Hamas recognising the right of Israel to exist; the same arguments they use against it (I&#39;m thinking the &#39;we were here first&#39; argument) apply just as well in the opposite direction, now: the people in Israel today are <i>not</i> the people who created the country, and regardless of how those founders are regarded, the current inhabitants shouldn&#39;t have it rubbed off on them.<br><br>(Though, er, aren&#39;t you still shooting at Hizballah occasionally? So don&#39;t you need some sort of peace-making with them too, even if it&#39;s the &#39;make a desert&#39; variety?)<br><br>Short version: no, terrorists are not friends.

            <p>I&#39;m sorry to say this, but I have to disagree with you on Israel. There is significant archeological evidence to suggest that the Jews lived in Israel in ancient times. In fact, the historian Josephus, who lived at the time of the Roman Empire, actually outlines the events that led to the Jews getting kicked out of Israel, I believe it was the Bar Kochba revolt. It was at this point that the Jews, for the most part were kicked out of Israel, which later became Palestine, I believe as a result of the Sykes-Picot Agreement.<br><br>What I&#39;m saying is that it&#39;s way more complicated than that. Just wanted to bring it to your attention. It&#39;s really a fascinating story, the story of the Jews. Here&#39;s a link to just a small bit of what I&#39;m talking about. Granted, it looks at things from a Biblical perspective, sort of, but it&#39;s much more scientific in its approach and it&#39;s documenting the history of Judaism and the Jewish people.<br><br><a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/ancient/archeology-hebrew-bible.html"><a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/ancient/archeology-hebrew-bible.html">http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/ancient/archeology-hebrew-bible.html</a></a><br><br>Also, to go off on a rabbit trail, I have found during my College research recently that Hezbollah (or Hizbollah, however it&#39;s spelled) as well as Hamas are both receiving guns and money from Iran. So, I think that there are a lot of factors behind the problems with Hamas and Hezbollah, but things are not as simple as a plain old peace talk. It&#39;s infuriating, really.<br><br>Oh well. What can ya do, but keep doing the same old thing. The world is an insane place.</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve actually read Josephus, as it happens. Quite interesting. (I picked it up along with the Mabinogion, Iliad &amp; Odyssey, and Machiavelli, at a bookstore that was closing down.)<br><br>But by the same logic, I should be entitled to land in Germany (where the Angles came from) and Scandinavia (for my Viking side); the Welsh should be permitted to take over the whole of England; white people should be displaced from the Americas; the whole of Europe should be given up in favour of those people with the most mixed-in Neanderthal DNA...<br><br>Oh, and Israel should make a concerted effort to seek out those of Canaanite blood, and deed over all their lands to them. It&#39;s only fair. ^<em>~<br><br>My point is that it&#39;s all wildly irrelevant. The Israelis are there; so are the Arabs; none of the people currently living there are the ones involved in the decisions of &#39;48. Attempting to demand that all Israelis leave/give up their rights/culture/whatever is exactly as wrong as declaring that all of Spain should be handed to the Basque.<br><br>Which would be hilarious, come to think of it.<br><br>hS<br><br>(PS: Thank you for disagreeing with me by agreeing with me. ^</em>^)</p>

            <p>Oh, you&#39;ve read Homer and Machiavelli? Awesome! They&#39;re good reads.<br><br>That&#39;s only assuming that the Jews took over Israel with military force. That didn&#39;t happen. The international community gave them Israel. And nobody made the Arabs leave Israel. There are still lots of Arabs there, and in order to try and get along, the Jews gave them some pretty sweet minority rights. It&#39;s a good deal for them, and yet they aren&#39;t satisfied. They just want the Jews gone. They don&#39;t want their land back. Well, some of them do, but the Palestinians are frequently turning to Jihad, and that&#39;s not cool. <br><br>Also, that&#39;s only if you believe that man evolved from whatever it is people say we evolved from. Not everyone believes that. Not saying whether or not I believe it, just saying that not everyone buys into the idea. I think it&#39;s seen as an insult, to be honest.<br><br>Why? The Canaanites were jerks. Are there even Canaanites still around? I probably should have looked that up beforehand, come to think of it, but I can be real here, right?<br><br>I agree. I completely agree. And as I have said just now, the Arabs get a pretty sweet deal with their minority rights. The Israelis just want to get along. Nothing wrong with that.<br><br>As for your post script, I&#39;m a little lost. But if we agree, and we can get along and move on, then I&#39;m cool with it. I&#39;ll drop this point, because it doesn&#39;t matter.</p>

Wait, that&#39;s literally exactly what happened. They were told to leave the land they&#39;d inherited for centuries to make room for people whose ancestors had left thousands of years prior. Do you really think they just &quot;made room&quot; for the influx of people? Getting shunted to the West Bank was part of it. Now they&#39;re being kicked out of there. I&#39;m sympathetic to Israelis as well as Palestinians, but to claim no one was made to leave is plain wrong. <br><br><i>There are still lots of Arabs there, and in order to try and get along, the Jews gave them some pretty sweet minority rights. </i><br>O_o &quot;some pretty sweet minority rights&quot; doesn&#39;t set your teeth on edge at all, huh? They were granted, so generously, minority rights by people coming into land without their consent. <br><br>Again, I don&#39;t want to see anyone kicked out of land they&#39;re living in. I know people who live in Jerusalem, and I know people who live in Lebanon and have family on the West Bank, and really, I pretty much would just like to see all sides of this conflict put down their gorram guns and talk. </p>

At my university we both have a Jewish group and an Islamic group, and neither have tried to kill each other that anyone&#39;s noticed.

But when there&#39;s decades of pain and anger, and a lot of people angling for more power and money . . .  that tends to be hard for anyone, on any side of the border, to achieve.

            <p>It&#39;s complicated.<br>1) It should be noted that a peace process isn&#39;t an end in and of itself, unlike what some people think. It&#39;s a means to and end (peace, obviously), and not the sole means.<br>2) There have been some border incidents involving Hizballah recently. However, peace with Hizballah is downright pointless since they&#39;re basically the Ayatollah regime&#39;s stooges. Peace with the <i>Lebanese government</i> is desirable once they actually start functioning.<br>3) The difference between the IRA and our garden variety terrorists (Hamas, Hizballah, PIJ, etc etc) is best summed up by this anecdote: the commissioner of the Met was interviewed after 7/7; he expressed surprise the terrorists did not phone ahead of time to warn of the bombs. That&#39;s a very telling difference between organisations like the IRA (and our own homegrown variety back from before 1948 for that matter) and Islamic Jihadists. Therefore, the things that apply to the IRA don&#39;t necessarily apply to our situation here.<br>4) Just noting that the &#39;we were here first&#39; argument is blarney; Tacitus mentions Jews in Palestine long before Arabs were even a thing, and he&#39;s not exactly philosemitic. </p>

            <p>First off, of course socialism includes property rights. I&#39;m calling for something like Sweden&#39;s system, not gulag-era USSR! No one* wants to abolish all private property, that&#39;s absurd. <br><br>Strictly speaking, we already have, and have had for some time, parts of a socialist system. They worked pretty well until Reagan and then Bush started dismantling them. For example: public, i.e. tax-funded, education**. Social security - a tax-funded safety net for retirees and seniors. EBT/food stamps - a safety net for families who can&#39;t afford to buy food. (Spare me the lists of alleged abuses, please, if anyone&#39;s thinking it. I have known far too many people whose parents relied on food stamps in highschool and still couldn&#39;t get their kids enough to eat in the summers.)<br><br>So here&#39;s my query. A hypothetical man has a wife and two children. He also has four houses, two of which are sprawling estates and the other two of which are country homes. He inherited enough money to put him through business and law school, and then spent 6-12 years as an executive of a major bank. When the bailouts happened, his company didn&#39;t have enough money to pay his high-end six-figure salary and that of all their workers, because too many loan customers, who didn&#39;t have the money to go to business or law school, and therefore work as cashiers or bus drivers or window-washers, could no longer pay their mortgage. <br><br>How much money - like say, how many millions, or billions, of dollars does this man have to have in his bank account before the law says, okay, that&#39;s more money than any one person could ever spend, not counting the trust funds for his two kids – now we&#39;re going to tax you at a higher rate so the several hundred families who live in the shadow of your mansion can afford to send their kids to a state school?<br><br>Because that&#39;s where capitalism leads. If this man - who, as I&#39;m sure you know, is both hypothetical and very very real, finds out that he has cancer, he can go to the finest doctors and the best hospitals and, if his health is okay, he has a good chance of recovery. If one of his bank&#39;s poorer tenants finds out they have cancer, they will almost certainly not be able to afford treatment, and will almost certainly sicken and die, because good health insurance is expensive and treatment is impossible to afford without it. I fail to understand how the idea of “Life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness” can lead to a literal price on the human life. And don&#39;t even get me started on the &quot;justice&quot; system***. <br><br>Capitalism may well be &quot;what America was set up for.&quot; That&#39;s arguable. Certainly (most of) the founders were interested in maintaining a landed <s>aristocracy</s> upper class, and a hierarchy of landless non-citizens with fewer rights. But I don&#39;t particularly care. The founders were neither saints nor prophets, and the Constitution is neither a sacred document not a magic scroll. Among other things, it contains the 3/5 Compromise. <br><br>So, fine. America&#39;s not set up for socialism, but capitalism. Okay. Then let&#39;s <i>fix</i> that, because I&#39;m rather tired of the idea that a government owes more to its wealthy citizens than it does to its poor. <br><br><br><br><br>*<sup>Some people absolutely want to dismantle the concept of private property, but they are 1) a tiny minority, 2) demonstrably hypocrites, and 3) not socialists, nor even Marxists generally speaking, but anarchists.</sup><br><br>**My problem with this is it generally is divided into district-wide income tax, which created vast gaps of education quality based on whether one&#39;s parents can afford to live in a &quot;good&quot; or a &quot;bad&quot; district. In Connecticut, you have many places where on one side of the river are good schools, with ~20 kids to a class, both gifted and special ed classes, and modern equipment - and on the other side, 40 kids to a class, equipment and textbooks that haven&#39;t been updated in years or decades, and no advanced classes to speak of. <br><br>***Because, see, if he gets arrested for having an ounce of cocaine in his pocket, he will pay a fine, worth maybe 1/10 of what his cheapest car is worth, and walk free. If one of his bank&#39;s tenants has an ounce of marijuana in his pocket, he&#39;ll spend monts or years in prison. Because the &quot;free market&quot; led to one person having so much they need never fear a single consequence, and another, inherently of the same human value, to have <i>nothing</i>.</p>

            <p>Let&#39;s be honest with ourselves. We are very likely to enter a Republican era. Hillary has a <i>slight</i> chance, but if you thought that the people who scream &quot;Commie Scumbag Obummer&quot; will allow a legit Left candidate, you are very mistaken. And even many of the people who vote Democrat are likely a little more on the right scale then Bernie is. The literals have a target on their backs, and the Republican party knows it.<br><br>The best chance Sanders has is if Hillary falls flat on her face harder, and if Trump wins the nomination. Trump is a nutball, and we all know it. However, if just enough people are split over the, what are we at now, sixteen Republican candidates, Trump might have a chance at the nomination. If he gets it, the Dems walk right into the white house. If not... Well, we likely have a Republican government. Yippee.</p>

            <p>Not trying to be controversial here, so I&#39;ll try and tread lightly.<br><br>Let me start off by saying I am a Republican. Specifically, I am a Conservative Republican, because apparently, we are splitting ourselves into petty factions now. (Why can&#39;t it be simple, like it used to be?) Now, with that in mind, try and see things from my perspective.<br><br>That being said, it does objectively look like a Republican will win this one. Most of them have articulated their positions very well, as compared to the Democrats, who are trying to differentiate themselves from Obama for one reason or another. The biggest exception is Bernie Sanders, and that&#39;s why people are drawn to him at all. At least he&#39;s honest about what he believes, people are saying. Clinton just comes off as sort of, well, fake. And to top it all off, there&#39;s this email thing going on. A lot of people seem to think that she&#39;s hiding something. That&#39;s significant, obviously.<br><br>I take issue with the way you characterized people like me, though. Yes, there are people who think Obama is a Communist, myself NOT being one of them. There is some evidence for this theory. For example, his father was an avowed member of the Communist Party of Kenya. Some of his associates growing up were Marxists. Is he a Communist? Who really knows? He&#39;s definitely pretty far Left, though. That has never been in question. As for the scumbag thing, we can fling insults at each other all day. It doesn&#39;t solve anything. The only ones who throw them around are Internet trolls and angry people in rural America. <br><br>I don&#39;t want an apology for that. Just trying to set the record straight.<br><br>Now, as for Trump... Hooo, boy! He&#39;s a character. He&#39;s not presidential material, but he&#39;s entertaining. The only reason he does as well as he does is because people are upset by the status quo. And even then, Ben Carson is now tied with Trump in some of the polls. He&#39;s losing his steam. He&#39;ll drop out eventually. The only question is when, and how much entertainment can we get out of him before he goes?<br><br>But who knows? A Republican government might be what we need. I&#39;ll admit, the Kennedy administration and the Truman administration were good examples of Democrat administrations that even we Republicans secretly admire. We&#39;ll just have to wait and see what we get, I guess. (And vote, of course.)</p>

            <p>That he was attacking Conservative Republicans per-se, more so just restating what has been a part of political rhetoric for a long time.

            <p>I&#39;m not talking your run-of-the-mill Republican. I&#39;m talking those who fall to rhetoric and choose not to study and think for themselves, but take only what Fox and Friends say as absolute truth. Unfortunately, that rhetoric has dominated the political landscape for a long time now, on both sides, and sadly shapes how most people view opposition. I will even admit to falling into it a little myself, though I try my hardest to keep it to a minimum.</p>

            <p>The only problem I have with the pledge is how we say we are &quot;one nation, under God.&quot; I am a huge champion of First Amendment rights, both to the true legal extent, and the idealized version of it. We honor and protect religious freedoms in this country, by granting the right to pray to any being we please, including the full right to choose not to abide by any faith. Forcing those who follow a religion outside of Judaeo-Christian faiths to send praise to a god not of their own is wrong, and goes against the spirit of the Constitution. Is that racist, though? Not in the least.<br><br>As for &quot;religious nut-jobs,&quot; I reserve this term for those who try to enforce their specific religion&#39;s values onto the whole of America&#39;s citizens. Many of those peoples use &quot;religious freedom&quot; as an excuse to stomp down an any other religion that does not recognize Jesus Christ as their Lord and Savior, and the tenants spoken of within the Bible. Do you want religious freedom? Then you have to grant freedom to those who follow Buddha, Allah, the Flying Spaghetti Monster, and any other faith of this green Earth.<br><br>You can tell this is a touchy subject for me. However, I will call out militant Atheists as well. Just because you hold no faith, does no mean others are not aloud to follow and even preach what they please. If faith in a Higher Power gives them comfort and a purpose in life, what does that have to do with you? Science and faith are not incompatible. It does not have to be, at any rate.<br><br>I realized I got off point a tad. I&#39;ll keep it in, though. it is something that needed to be said, and something I will continue to say whenever the topic comes up.</p>

            <p>The pledge does predate the Cold War by about 100 years.  It was actually part of the Reconstruction Era.  Lincoln wanted the Rebels to say the pledge and they he would welcome them back.  But it is still a form of nationalism.  But nationalism is not inherently a bad thing either.

            <p>Any historian of post-1865 America* can point to the Cold War as the point where America swung very hard to the right, and has stayed there for the past 70ish years. The push for &quot;We are a Christian Nation with Godly Values and wholesome gender norms&quot; was a direct response to the anti-religion, pro-gender equality ideals of the Soviet regime (at least at first, before Lenin&#39;s illness and also before Lenin kind of got cold feet about the whole &quot;gender equality&quot; thing).<br><br><br><br><br><br>*except Mike Allen, who still teaches that in his classes IIRC but published a book saying otherwise for the money</p>

            <p>Apparently, my high school didn&#39;t recognize the fact that it&#39;s not, in fact, legal to force students to peacefully protest the Pledge by not standing during the announcements. My homeroom teacher got in huge trouble when the principal peeked into our room one morning during the Pledge to see me and a small handful of other students not participating. Those of us who refused to stand were also given detention.<br><br>Come to America, where freedom and tolerance are our guiding values!</p>

            <p>I find it very strange that anyone would find it offensive that &quot;one nation, under God&quot; is in the pledge. I don&#39;t get that. In this case, the phrase is being used in a more figurative sense. It&#39;s the same thing as people saying, &quot;If this happens, by God I&#39;ll be so angry-&quot; or something like that. People who don&#39;t believe in the God of the Bible use phrases like that all the time. It&#39;s not promoting a single religion over the others, it&#39;s just a part of a more archaic version of English.<br><br>And religious freedom is more than just the right to pray, actually. It&#39;s the right to practice your religion as well. That&#39;s why we don&#39;t (or at least, didn&#39;t used to) force people to do things they didn&#39;t want to do for religious reasons. Fundamentalist Christians don&#39;t have to fight in the military, they can be conscientious objectors. Jews don&#39;t have to eat pork for any reason. Muslims don&#39;t have to consume alcohol. I would go into the issue of Christians not needing to be forced to accommodate gay marriage, but that&#39;s a whole different issue. I&#39;ll just leave that alone with this. If there are two bakers who can bake your wedding cake, one Christian who respectfully declines to bake your cake for religious reasons, and instead points you toward the second bakery, who is all too happy to bake the cake, then why force the Christian baker to bake the cake? It makes no sense.<br><br>Who tries to enforce their views on Americans? Can you provide me with examples?<br><br>It is indeed a touchy subject for everyone. Why can&#39;t we all just get along, am I right? I&#39;ll just come out and say it right now, I am an unashamed Christian, and I imagine there are some Atheists here. We aren&#39;t here to argue about these things, we&#39;re here to have fun with the PPC. But we&#39;re all friends here.<br><br>As long as we all get to say what we all feel without getting too aggressive with each other, we should all be fine.</p>

            <p>Jews keeping kosher, Muslims not drinking alcohols, and fundamentalist Christians not serving in the military are all examples that aren&#39;t founded in bigotry or causing harm to other people. Denying people the right to get married, and thus the rights that come with being legally married, is an example absolutely founded in bigotry and can cause harm, in my opinion. In the cake example, well. Certainly they are entitled to their opinion, but all people in the United States should be free from discrimination in their everyday life, including in buying cakes. </p>

            <p>It absolutely is NOT founded in bigotry, and I take offense to that. We have our perfectly legitimate reasons to oppose gay marriage, but we are taught to still be kind to them. We are supposed to be kind to everyone, because that&#39;s what God did for us. That&#39;s the way it is. We don&#39;t oppose gay marriage because we hate people! We oppose it because, a) gay marriage will have unintended consequences on traditional marriages, and b) people are trying to FORCE us to do this. That&#39;s not right, and that&#39;s discrimination against US. <br><br>Think about that point of view. If gay marriage is all about love, then why are people so angry? Why are they trying to force their own beliefs on everyone else? I thought that sort of thing made you angry. Why is this any different?<br><br>I ain&#39;t even mad, bro.

            <p>So if someone&#39;s religious beliefs tell them that, say, being black is a sin, denying a black person service suddenly becomes a-okay and no longer bigotry?<br><br>As for the &quot;traditional marriages&quot; part, honestly, every time I see someone espousing &quot;traditional family values&quot; they end up having two accounts on Ashley Madison or have been remarried 4 times. I&#39;m not saying that either of those situations are necessarily bad (. . .though cheating on your spouse is pretty definitely not cool), it&#39;s just that there&#39;s a lot of hypocrisy that permeates that argument! (Side note: am not accusing you of those things, it&#39;s just a trend I&#39;ve noticed with that argument.) The idea of &quot;traditional marriages&quot; tends to be very Christian-centric and often kinda shitty towards women, among other things.

            <p>Okay, what religions do you know of that says that? Name one major religion that is still around today that says that. That is a false analogy, to use terminology that is far more harsh than I intended it to be.<br><br>What kind of people have you been hanging around with? I&#39;d say that the people who do those things have serious issues that they need to deal with.<br><br>And those are bad situations. Putting your personal information into an unsecure website so that you can cheat on your spouse is a bad situation. As for being married four times, that&#39;s either a bad situation, or the person who was married four times is very unlucky, and their spouses all died. That&#39;s not likely, so it&#39;s a bad situation.<br><br>Okay, so you&#39;re basically saying that just because the people who have traditional marriages are screwed up people, that makes the entire institution of traditional marriage screwed up? That literally makes no sense. There&#39;s hypocrisy on the side of gay marriage as well, I&#39;d like to point out. If it&#39;s all about love, then why are the homosexuals so angry with the Christians? Okay, so say that we are being unreasonable and bigoted. Let&#39;s just assume that for a second. If gay marriage is all about love, and we&#39;re being the mean ones, then why can&#39;t they all go somewhere that will accommodate them? Why is it they don&#39;t want to just be left alone? If it&#39;s all about love, then why all the hatred for us?<br><br>Thank you for not accusing me of those things, because I am literally in College, have been single my whole life, and am smart enough not to do any of those stupid things on the Internet.<br><br>So what if it&#39;s Christian-centric? Secular people (or atheists, or whatever you prefer I call you) use our ideas all the time. Without Christianity, Western civilization would have turned out completely different. <br><br>I thought that that sort of language was supposed to stay off the Board!<br><br>In what ways are traditional marriages bad for women? The man works the fields, the woman works on monopolizing the workings of the home itself. It&#39;s division of labor. That&#39;s fair.<br><br>It&#39;s bad because the mold gets broken. Think about it. In the majority of cases, divorces create some level of drama, because it wasn&#39;t naturally supposed to be that way. Same thing with certain things outside of marriage, if you know what I mean. <br><br>First of all, why would two total strangers marry each other? That doesn&#39;t make any sense. Second of all, it doesn&#39;t affect my life, but that&#39;s a false argument. The point I&#39;m getting across is that it&#39;s wrong, no matter how it affects me. Something else that&#39;s wrong is trying to force other people to do what you want them to do, like get two homosexuals married, despite the fact that it violates that person&#39;s faith. That&#39;s wrong! That&#39;s what I&#39;m trying to say. It doesn&#39;t matter how people getting married affects my life, because it doesn&#39;t. I personally think that if two gay people want to get married, under the laws of the United States, they can get married. I have a religious objection to that, but still. The problem arises when you try and force people to do things your way, and even worse when you try and force them to like it that they&#39;re forcing you to do it.<br><br>Does that make sense? Does that answer your question?</p>

            <p>.. just how much you actually know about the Bible. Because any true Christian can tell you that the Old Testament was like a dictionary of things that you should not do. Setting people on fire, sacrificing babies, polygamy, all of those things are presented negatively.<br><br>Abraham had one wife, Sarah. He fooled around with his slave, which he was not supposed to do and made him unhappy. Jacob was conned by his father-in-law and was caught between his love for someone else and his cultural duty not to divorce his other wife. Besides which, Jacob&#39;s life was pretty much screwed up in many other ways. David&#39;s infidelity cost him the lives of his children. He wasn&#39;t supposed to do what he did, and he suffered for it. And Solomon screwed up big time, he even said as much. <br><br>The interracial stuff is much more complicated than that. The Old Testament authors thought that we would be smart enough to understand that. I don&#39;t have the time or knowledge to explain it all to you, but I would suggest finding a real, honest Christian who understands the Bible fully to explain it to you, not one of your wishy-washy Christians who hurl insults at people at Chili&#39;s.<br><br>Oh boy. One single story. Well, doesn&#39;t that just sink my entire argument (not). That has cultural context that you need to look into. And no, nobody does that anymore, not even the Jews, who were the ones who did that.<br><br>Paul said that because he was single and very happy about it. He didn&#39;t say avoid marriage at all costs, buddy. He actually said in the exact same letter that any man and woman who want to get married should do so.<br><br>Wrong. Not all marriages were arranged, many of them were approved. Big difference.<br><br>So, what I&#39;m getting here is that you don&#39;t think that love should be a part of marriage. <br></p>

            <p>How much YOU know. First things first: stop with the &quot;true Christian&quot; stuff, it&#39;s quite insulting to those of us who AREN&#39;T going after people for their choice of love. Quite frankly, it implies that you, as a &quot;true Christian&quot;, are better than someone else simply because of how much you claim to know. Romans 3:23 says that &quot;all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God&quot;. Galatians 3:28 states that &quot;we are all one in Christ Jesus.&quot; Basically? We are all equal. You can&#39;t claim moral superiority, and seeing as those are basic verses taught in 1st and 2nd grade Sunday schools, you really ought to know better if you&#39;re at a Christian college. In addition? Back up what you claim. Your professors would be ashamed to hear you claim things without the Scripture to back it up, dude. <br><br>Second, you can&#39;t throw around the Old Testament and then claim people are ignoring cultural context. The Old Testament is almost entirely contextual to the Israelites, so don&#39;t try to apply it to situations today without, again, backing it up.<br><br>You&#39;re treading on a lot of toes right now. Watch your tone.</p>

            <p>The Bible doesn&#39;t call it traditional, because we called it traditional. It&#39;s the same principle we used to label classical music classical music. The adjective &quot;traditional&quot; was added to identify it in relation to where we are in history. <br><br>Okay, now it&#39;s &quot;religious marriage?&quot; I thought this was about traditional marriage. I&#39;m sorry. Totally different topic. Married people can practice whatever religion they want, as far as I&#39;m concerned. But they probably ought to have the same religion, or there will be some conflict. Ya know?<br><br>But seriously, it is definitely different because for some reason, the government decided to get itself involved with marriage. I&#39;m not sure when that started, and I don&#39;t know why, but I can ask my professors. My guess is that they&#39;ll probably tell me that the government wanted to protect the institution of marriage as it was traditionally. Say what you want about it. Say that it promotes one religion over the others, or whatever you want, but that&#39;s just an educated guess what my professors are going to say.<br><br>So wait, love is NOT an essential ingredient for marriage? That&#39;s the first time I&#39;ve heard that one. Oh, you must be referring to the archaic practice of marrying into powerful families for wealth or political power. Or perhaps you&#39;re referring to the barbaric practice of selling your daughter to a man who can afford her dowry? Oh yeah, those are much better examples of marriage than one man and one woman in today&#39;s society. <br><br>Well, without mutual respect and loyalty, it&#39;s going to be a lousy marriage. But they&#39;re not exactly THE primary ingredients for marriage.<br><br>Well, submission had a different definition back then. I&#39;ll have to look up exactly what it meant, but it didn&#39;t mean what it does now.</p>

            <p>I know that I may be alone in this issue, but let me draw an analogy. Should a Christian doctor be forced to euthanize someone? Or should a Christian salesman be forced to trick customers into a bad deal? <br><br>No, because it goes against their rights to conscience. It goes against the basic tenets of Christianity. And nobody forces people to do those things, because they&#39;re wrong. <br><br>Now, I want to clarify something before anybody even goes here. We do believe that homosexuality is a sin. But we also believe that there are literally dozens, if not hundreds of different sins, and that everyone everywhere is guilty of at least one of them. Do we hate the people who commit these sins? No, because that would be hypocritical, because we are just as guilty, if not more so, and it would go against what God tells us. We are to show compassion for, and offer forgiveness, and share common humanity with everyone, regardless of who they are or what they&#39;ve done. You know why? Well, believe me or disbelieve me, but the reason is that the Lord has forgiven us Christians for our sins, and we&#39;re not better than God, so we can&#39;t judge people. <br><br>We oppose gay marriage for the same reasons we oppose brothels and pornography (sorry to raise some taboo subjects, but I had to). But again, we don&#39;t judge the people in there as being lesser than we are, or inferior in some way. The only difference between those people and us is that we know God and they don&#39;t, or they don&#39;t care to. And in American fashion, that&#39;s fine if they don&#39;t care to. All we Christians can do is present Christianity to them, like salespeople, and they can take it or leave it.<br><br>Interestingly enough, Islam also opposes gay marriage. We never hear anyone threatening them with lawsuits. </p>

            <p>I&#39;m getting tired of these emotionally-fueled, blinded by preconception, false arguments. They make me think you&#39;re getting mad at me.<br><br>I personally trust the recent scientific finds that say homosexuality is an abnormality in the brain. But does that mean we should treat them like they&#39;re subhuman? No! I have a little brother who has autism, and his brain doesn&#39;t function correctly either. He&#39;s just as human, and maybe a little bit smarter than I am (or was, at his age). <br><br>All that to say, it&#39;s not even about love, it&#39;s about sexual attraction. They&#39;re two very different things.<br><br>What is pansexual?<br><br>Well, good for you for saying that. They&#39;re family, you&#39;re stuck with them either way. And I would still love any of my brothers if they were gay, too. But I wouldn&#39;t let them sin that way. I view it as a responsibility of mine to help them understand why it&#39;s wrong. I don&#39;t treat them any differently, and I get them to understand that God loves them, even if they&#39;re gay. <br><br>Oh boy, a story.<br><br>Doesn&#39;t sound like he was a very Christian man to me. Sounds like he was a dirt bag. But you&#39;re giving me a false choice here. You&#39;re making it seem like the ONLY options are homosexuality, or an abusive marriage. That&#39;s not the choice I would suggest at all, and you know it. I&#39;d have to be a dirt bag for even saying that it is. She has many other options, besides that dog. (The husband, not the other lady) <br><br>You sound like you&#39;re accusing me of being a horrible person. I don&#39;t appreciate that. </p>

            <p>Because that source says literally nothing about brain abnormalities, all it says is that there is a possible genetic cause for homosexuality. Genetic cause does not necessarily mean &quot;abnormal&quot;; in fact, that article reinforces that, gasp, homosexuality isn&#39;t a choice and isn&#39;t unnatural?</p>

            <p>I identify as genderfluid. I am pansexual. Christians, for all the talk of hating the sin and not the sinner, still demand I become a straight male under threat of eternal hellfire and damnation. So do other religions, but the key point is that the present ruler of the United States publicly identifies as a Christian, as did the forty-three previous incumbents. It is not discrimination against Christian Americans to demand they treat people with the respect and privileges that they themselves have been accorded. Indeed, that is an article of faith - do unto others and all that. Denying someone the right to marry the person they love purely on the basis of said person&#39;s biology? That is discrimination. It is also an affront to any society that considers itself civilized.<br><br>That&#39;s my piece said. Talk amongst yourselves.</p>

            <p>Supposed there is a person whose job it is to make marriages. When they chose this job, marriage to them (and everybody else they talked to) meant one man and one woman, and they had no reason to expect that this would change in the foreseeable future. Now, the U.S. Supreme Court decided to regard a wider definition of marriage. Should we tell them that they, if they don&#39;t like the change in their job description that results from our<sup>*)</sup> expanded definition of marriage, should stop doing what they enjoyed to do for many years, and find a new job, because they are never allowed to make any marriage ever? This doesn&#39;t feel right to me.<br><br>All Dark Brother asks for is apparently that persons should be allowed to opt out of an unexpected new duty that had not been in the job description, if they genuinely don&#39;t feel prepared to do it; and although I&#39;m not religious I can understand somebody asking for this.<br><br>On the other hand, not everybody has the privilege of being able to travel far, and the least gays can ask for is that we<sup>*)</sup> don&#39;t allow the existence of regions where it is impossible to find somebody who didn&#39;t opt out. I don&#39;t see an easy way to have this cake and eat it too.<br><br><sup>*)</sup> I&#39;m obviously no part of the U. S. Supreme Court or the U.

            <p>1/ We&#39;re talking about the clerks who hand out marriage licenses, apparently, and their job description hasn&#39;t changed: it&#39;s &#39;give licenses to couples permitted to get married&#39;. What has changed is <i>the law</i>, and you don&#39;t get to opt out of bits of the law that you don&#39;t like. ^_~<br><br>2/ Even if that weren&#39;t the case... no. If you&#39;re a vegetarian who works in a sandwich shop, and that shop suddenly introduces a steak sandwich, you don&#39;t get to refuse to serve people who ask for it. Your customers come in expecting a certain service; if you can&#39;t give that to them, should you really still be doing the job?<br><br>My job has just expanded. I work for a chemical company (yes, yes, the horror, shaddup, we sell soap); due to new regulations, we&#39;re now required to be able to trace anything that harms microbes back to an approved supplier. We don&#39;t get to opt out of that - <i>I</i> don&#39;t get to opt out of that, since the task of getting our Sales team to actually gather the information has fallen on my shoulders. It&#39;s a horrible job, and definitely not in my job description even now - but it&#39;s <b>my job</b>, and if I refuse to do it, why are they paying me?<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Clerks who provide the marriage licenses willing joined the Government.  So circumstances have somewhat changed, but they really haven&#39;t, every year more States were legalizing same-sex marriage on their own. <br><br>Saying that they should be exempt from issuing the licenses because of the changed circumstances seems absurd to me.  Taking that logic to it extreme you could say a person who joins the military in peace and there is no indication of any war starting for the individuals term, and then a war occurs, that would mean that he should be allowed to leave without consequence.  <br><br>The fact of the matter is the clerks signed up for the job, and if they do not like the decision they have plenty of options, like resigning.   </p>

            <p>A better analogy would be a soldier who is perfectly willing to do most of their job, and certainly doesn&#39;t want to leave; they just don&#39;t want to kill this specific soldier over there in the other trench because this &quot;enemy&quot; happens to be their best friend from the PPC Board. Of course the officer in command won&#39;t have such nonsense, and this must end in tragedy. <br><br>But since in having a wedding immediate action shouldn&#39;t be as urgent as in a war, no such big drama should ensue. If Clerk A doesn&#39;t want to provide the marriage license to a specific couple for whatever reason, let Clerk B do it, and let Clerk A do their duty for any number of other couples. It&#39;s mostly a matter of thoughtful scheduling. Problems should only arise if Clerk B doesn&#39;t exist or is out of reach.<br><br>Clerk A is supposed to be part of an oppressed minority to whom this is a matter of live or death (or rather heaven or hell), and largely outnumbered by Clerk Bs, who don&#39;t see much of a problem there. In such circumstances, can&#39;t we find better solutions than going up to eleven on the authoritarian/libertarian-axis? I&#39;m naive, I believe we can.<br><br>HG </p>

            <p>Is that anyone and everyone slightly to the left of Enoch Powell was comprehensively redbaited out of mainstream American politics over the course of several decades, and it&#39;s still going on now. To put things into context, the Democrats are only now beginning to edge tentatively leftwards, though are still far, far short of being actual socialists (universal healthcare&#39;d be a good start, which - let me be clear - Obamacare only sort of is); during the &#39;90s, they were doing much the same stuff as the Tory party, particularly Clinton repealing the Glass-Spiegel Act as a sop to the Republicans.<br><br>To an outside observer, the Democrats and the Republicans are respectively the party of the right and the party of the considerably further right. And then you have Donald Trump and his hairstyle like a small electrocuted Muppet, who managed to be about as right-wing as it&#39;s possible to be without sounding like an Onion article. There are no mainstream alternatives. This needs to change. Sanders having a good run, well, it&#39;ll work.<br><br>So the centre-right by European standards is the Democrats&#39; core vote, the far-right is the Republicans&#39;, and Trump... well, I was working on the assumption that his pointy ghost outfit was in the wash. What I&#39;m worried about is that the Republicans will be dragged further and further towards The Donald, and that American politics will become even more disgustingly, uselessly partisan than it is already. Americans deserve better than that, in my view.<br><br>But then, it&#39;s not like I&#39;m not biased.</p>

            <p>The Donald doesn&#39;t already sound like an Onion article?  I am shocked.  He should work on that.<br><br>Anyway, I basically agree with you.  I am actually of the opinion that the ridiculousness of Donald Trump is a harbinger of a fracturing Republican party.

            <p>The sheer level of anger most people seem to have, has everyone flocking to Trump.  Even early polls are showing Trump with leads over everyone, including both Sanders and Clinton.  <br><br>And a couple other points, but this will be all I am saying on it (at least until the parties are decided).  As to Sander&#39;s being a Left Candidate, that&#39;s not necessarily a good thing.  First just because something works in Europe does not mean it will work in the US with the US context.  Take for example the Civil Law.  It works well in Europe, and in-fact most of the rest of the world, but in the US the only true Civil Law Jurisdiction is an absolute mess.  Second, does a left government actually work?<br><br>Let me set up an example.  I know two people, on the far side of middle-aged.  Born and raised in the US, both were at points very left aligned Democrats, though they since shifted right of center over a 20 year period.  Due to reasons they relocated to France.  A country that is well considered to be a left government.  And they have problems all over the place, because the government policies clash with elements of American Culture.  Let us start with the work week, in France, it is legally mandated 40 work week, one of the people in this couple fits very much into the &quot;Puritan Work Ethic&quot; foreigners often remark about of the US.  He would willingly work 50+ hours a week sometimes.  The 40 hour mandatory limit is problematic.  <br><br>There is also the crippling bureaucracy.  This couple has been living in France for over a year now, and they still do not have the State Healthcare, because of the bureaucratic quagmire.  There are ways around that, called &quot;grease&quot; payments, better known as bribes.  This is something that in certain departments is if not tolerated, then expected.  These types of payments are incredibly common throughout the world, but I find anathema to the US.  We were the leaders in the world on anti-bribery and anti-corruption, that many parties thought we were too restrictive, because these &quot;grease&quot; payments were expected if not encouraged.  (I cannot actually speak to the situation of corruption this is secondhand reports from a French National)<br><br>My bottom line on this line of questioning is that the US&#39;s overall culture may not be an acceptable climate from a Left government, particularly one that is both Left in Social and Economics (like Sanders).<br><br>Now the last point, a Republican Government is not necessarily a bad thing.  A Tea-Party government on the other hand, that could be problematic.  But not all Republicans are Tea Party members.  The only true Tea Party candidate in my opinion is Cruz, and he will go nowhere.  The Religious Right will also go nowhere.   </p>

            <p>That crippling bureaucracy is by no means endemic to left-leaning governments; take Israel&#39;s for example. It&#39;s right-wing (Bibi + Bennett + Haredi parties can&#39;t lean any other way) <i>and</i> the bureaucracy is as bad as you can imagine.</p>

            <p>Right-wing bureaucracies are <i>worse</i>. Because far-right governments are constantly trying to &quot;cut waste&quot; by shredding civil service budgets, the people forced to run these institutions have to do the exact same job of work on a whole lot less money. This means they do a worse job, which gives the right-wing government in charge an excuse to pare back even further because the problem is clearly in the people working there. It couldn&#39;t be their fault. That would be <i>silly</i>.<br><br>In the interests of full disclosure, I should mention that I did a Work Trial Placement at Dover JobCentre+. It was a shambles. I basically had to rebuild their filing system from the ground up. And when I went to Atos later in the year, one of the private contractors who get paid through the nose by the taxpayer to sort this out because private finance brings efficiency or some similar guff, it was worse. A <i>lot</i> worse. It was like the civil service but with all the compassion and joy taken out, which (as hS and others will doubtless know) is saying quite something.</p>

            <p>More so saying that what works for one context does not work for others.  <br><br>Crippling Bureaucracy is basically a problem of Western Civilization, it exists here in the US, though not as bad.  In retrospect that was not the best example, but I was again more getting at, Left does not necessarily mean good, Right does not necessarily mean bad, and more importantly just because Left Governments tend to work in Europe, does not by any stretch mean that they will work in the US.  Different cultural contexts and all that.  </p>

Per the proposed division of the table shown above, the team have crafted the following chart:<br><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/MoralCompass4a.png"><br><br>Elements which have been reexamined are shown in orange; those which could not be redetected are highlighted in blue.

If these three elements are in fact one and the same, the academic world will be shaken to the core. The reassignment of Desdendelle (Dd) and Darkotas (Dk) to refer to the same element, while also significant, is far less prominent.<br><br>Other shifts have been equally pronounced. The movement of PoorCynic (Pc) up two periods, and its replacement by the newly-identified element World-Jumper (Wj) has been noted, as has the identification of an entire new block, shown in brown and containing the most reactive elements yet discovered. (The failure to obtain a sample of doctorlit (Dl) is surprising, given the unreactiveness of this element).<br><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/MoralCompass4b.png"><br><br>This is an exciting time in the field of politicoprotectorate chemistry.

        <div class="post-body">
            <p>In the little village of Scapegrace, life continued as it had for many years. The free peoples tilled their lands in the iron-rich soils beyond the River&#39;s reach when it flooded, as rivers are wont to do. They grew tomatoes, turnips, peas, beans, sugar beet; sensible things, things that lasted long enough for the surplus to reach Central City by caravan or one of the Popular Dirigible Company&#39;s freighter blimps. The seasons came and went, but the years seemed to turn slower somehow, and the rich red earth fed all.<br><br>The call came from Central City, and the Centrists from Iximaz in particular were anxious to treat with the villagers. So they got what they could of the summer&#39;s blood-orange harvests in and began to assemble in the village square. They joined hands, as one, and waited for the Power to summon forth a representative.<br><br>Any individual from Scapegrace could touch upon the Power, but alone they could cast but a few sparks, enrich the earth, fix a blown gasket on a tractor. In concert? All the villagers together had cast one treaty to the Red Power, and did so every twenty years, after the fifth mayoral election. It kept the sun hanging in the sky, kept pests at bay, let their crops grow tall and their children grow strong. Scapegrace was a place of mild winters and lazy summers, with the wind blowing eastward to cool the harvest teams&#39; collective brows. The Power did this, as long as people thought it would, and worked to make it work.<br><br>It was this power that so intrigued the young woman from Central City, her graduation wand from the Iximaz School of Witchcraft and Wizardry still shiny from lack of use - and no matter how much the little scrits back at the School had said so, it wasn&#39;t the thought of muscular young farmhands of all genders working up a sweat beneath a burnt-blue August sky. She alighted delicately from the helicopter as it landed (crashing would not be <i>quite</i> the right term) in the beet field that was at present lying fallow and giving sterling service as a helipad. She&#39;d been expecting wood, this far south, but Scapegrace was apparently ably served by the brick-kilns at Artell. As she reached the square, she slowed and stopped.<br><br>There was the Red Power, flickering above the swaying, singing villagers like a demon holding court, powerful as a hurricane, strong as a mountain&#39;s roots. Strong here, anyway, where there were still those who believed. It was said in the village that the Power took on a different shape for everyone, and yet the general image remained the same; a human figure, holding a worker&#39;s tool in an experienced hand. To the young Centrist, the Red Power resembled her old Ancient Runes instructor, but with a burlier cast than the mantis-like academic had ever had.<br><br>As she stood, powerless to move, the Red Power descended from above the village, the rune-patterned cracks in its skin glowing like starlight as it moved. The marks intensified as it moved towards her, until the woman was all but blinded by it.<br><br>It reached out its hand, that was and was not a hand.<br><br>She took it.<br><br>And the Red Power was gone, its task done.<br><br>The villagers of Scapegrace came out of their trance like children roused from sleep on a long train ride. They looked around, and a small child ran towards the new arrival.<br><br>&quot;Da, da! Look! &#39;S&#39;an <i>angel</i>!&quot;<br><br>A slim farmhand, with close-cut blond hair and the kind of smoothly toned body that the woman liked best, strode over and picked the little boy up. &quot;Never mind him, young friend,&quot; he said over his shoulder, &quot;he don&#39;t mean owt by... it...&quot;<br><br>And he stared at the woman&#39;s hands, and with good reason, for they glowed like stars.<br><br>&quot;Please, come with me... we asked the Power ter choose, an&#39; it chose you, friend. Yer must be took to Mayor Cassandra an&#39; welcomed proper. What do we call&#39;n, other than friend of the People?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Gabrielle,&quot; the woman said, and shortly thereafter she heard it cheered.<br><br>---<br><br>Ain&#39;t no magic like socialist magic. =]</p>

            <p>It has been brought to my attention that I unfairly singled out the Right as being evil on the last graph.<br><br>I mean, I <i>didn&#39;t</i> do that, but it was still brought to my attention.<br><br>I have found a way to ensure I&#39;m never accused of that again.<br><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/MoralCompass2.png"><br><br>The realm of Diabolico is in chaos.

Under Kaitlyn&#39;s leadership, they have all grown evil moustaches to twirl (though Kaitlyn&#39;s is in fact her braid, wrapped around to the front). Their evil scheme is to threaten to blow the palace up with a five ultraton bomb, and then, while everyone is trying to figure out what that is in joules, to walk in and steal the throne.<br><br>Team I&#39;ll Show You Who&#39;s Mad are renowned for being hilariously evil. Their plot is to use PoorCynic&#39;s earthquake machine to set off all their opponents&#39; volcano fortresses simultaneously, engulfing the realm in a flood of lava which they will escape from in their zeppelin.<br><br>Finally, Team Surrounded By Incompetent Fools are noted as being ludicrously evil. They intend to summon an army of demons, using the power of their twin leaders Iximaz and Hieronymus to unleash the Hadean hordes upon the unsuspecting Diabolico.<br><br>Who will claim the victory? It&#39;s impossible to tell. The fate of Diabolico - nay, the world - hangs in the balance between these... there is no other way to say it... these evil hordes.<br><br>~<br><br>Because let&#39;s face it, we&#39;re all Chaotic Evil really.<br><br>DID I SAY EVIL ENOUGH YET?<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>All this debate over where the centreline should be made me realise something: who cares?

[Shrugs] And we have two people who are &#39;far right&#39; relative to the average - but note that ScapeDeathToAllCapitalistsGrace is only fairly moderate left, indicating a massive skew in the baseline.<br><br>It is interesting that EAIUO and Dark Brother both fall off the fairly consistent diagonal line - you&#39;re not nearly as authoritarian as one would expect from the trend. Make of that what you will.<br><br>But you know what this graph needs, to make it 100% more awesome?<br><br>A bit more D&amp;D.<br><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/MoralCompass.png"><br><br>(Dark colours are Evil, light are Good; the Good/Evil axis mirrors around the centreline.

<br><br>The land of Polyticz is a pleasant realm, prospering under the rule of King Desdendelle. He rules with a light hand, though those who transgress his laws watch in fear for the coming of General July and Chief Constable son<em>of</em>heaven176.<br><br>The king&#39;s chief advisors are Darkotas the Kind, World-Jumper the Erratic, and Pippa&#39;s Ghost the Lawyer, who seeks to uphold the law regardless of right or wrong. The apolitical Phobos, Iximaz, PoorCynic, and SeaTurtle can often be seen around his castle, and the wandering knight Huinesoron visits at times - though at others, it is said he attacks the king&#39;s distant holdings.<br><br>Yet all is not well in Polyticz. True, the Uber Overlord who stands in opposition to the king is known to rule as laxly as Desdendelle, but his great Admiral Dark Brother 16 wages relentless war on the marches of Polyticz. And there are home-grown troubles, too - the notorious revolutionaries known as the Free Radicals seek to bring down all of Desdendelle&#39;s domains. Should Kaitlyn, Artell, and Scapegrace get their way, Polyticz will have neither laws nor love, but only endless war.<br><br>(Because what we really needed was a second Medieval AU, and one which massively misrepresents people... ^_^)<br><br>hS</p>

I think it&#39;s supposed to play off some idea that liberal hippies say that anything can be art <i>man</i>, where conservative grumps say art must have some form to it. Consider it a dud question, it won&#39;t affect the numbers much.</p>

            <p>The stock market is something that just completely bewilders me. It&#39;s a form of Capitalism, from what I can tell, because people buy and sell stocks in a company, but that&#39;s all I know about it. I think that&#39;s more of a globalized market, not a globalized economy. Again, don&#39;t know anything about it almost, but that&#39;s what I think. <br><br>2. Oh, gotcha. It seems like a trick question, but I guess there are some people who might hit it out there.<br><br>3. So, what I&#39;m getting here is that we should steal from the rich to feed drugs to the poor with the money we take from them. This is one of my hot button topics, so I think I&#39;ll back off before I start to get going on it, ya know?<br><br>4. But that&#39;s their jobs. It&#39;s not as if it&#39;s a secret society of shadow governments manipulating the money to make themselves rich at the expense of some poor population in Kenya, or whatever. Anybody could become those things. I see absolutely nothing wrong with that.<br><br>6. Maybe it&#39;s meant to size up our personalities. </p>

It makes intuitive sense that someone who&#39;s just joined the military would swing to the Authoritarian end (due to the whole taking orders thing); someone who was already there last time - which I think Des was - won&#39;t show that swing, but might potentially start regressing to previous mindsets.<br><br>And so forth.

            <p>The idea expressed by the Telegraph that Labour didn&#39;t actually want to elect Corbyn, but were just putting him on the ballot to make a point, was emphatically and categorically <i>wrong</i>.

            <p>I was talking about the eighties, long after the creation of the NHS.  If the Labour Party had remained as organised and practical as that, I might have stayed on the Left.<br><br>I&#39;m talking about people like &quot;Red Ted&quot;, the (at the time) infamous Labour leader of Lambeth Council who refused to set a council budget as a gesture of defiance against the Tories.  The council services ended up in a mess, as the council headed to bankruptcy.  He and his colleagues ended up being taken to court and fined as a result.  And they still refused to take any responsibility for their actions, declaring themselves martyrs, converting one of the rooms in the Town Hall into a shrine to themselves, and blaming the Government for everything.<br><br>He and his colleagues were family friends, and held up by my mother as good role-models.  Did they achieve anything?  Nothing they intended to anyway.<br></p>

            <p>So, I have been toying around with some of my Agents, and a funny little idea popped into my head. Well, not funny, exactly, but it&#39;s a strange idea. I want to see what everyone thinks of it.<br><br>As you may all remember, or for all of the newbies here, who don&#39;t know this, the PPC has had several community-wide events called Crises that involve more craziness than usual. Such Crises include &quot;the Crashing Down Crisis,&quot; &quot;the Mary Sue Invasion of 2008,&quot; &quot;the Macrovirus Crisis,&quot; and &quot;the Black Cats Invasion.&quot; These don&#39;t tend to happen anymore, because these had been growing in intensity and frequency. Because of this, the Board decided to try and void doing these Crises anymore.<br><br>Bearing that in mind, I was wondering how difficult it would be for a small group of Agents to keep something that could potentially become a Crisis, or that is already a Crisis, but that doesn&#39;t yet directly involve the PPC, from becoming public knowledge, as well as shield the PPC from this Crisis?<br><br>I have no details on this concept whatsoever yet. It&#39;s just a vague idea. But I was wondering how far I could potentially bring this. If I play my cards right, and it&#39;s given a green light, I could take this idea pretty far and keep myself busy with it, compounded with actual missions, for a long time. And the best part is that the Crisis wouldn&#39;t be community wide, so no need to get any messy details. such as everyone meeting at the same time for a massive role-play, or whatever.<br><br>And of course, I reserve all rights to the idea (so to speak). Especially if it could actually go anywhere. If not, it&#39;s still my idea, but I would have to tinker with it a little.<br><br>Any thoughts?</p>

Involves large-scale action at HQ rather than taking place in the Word Worlds<br>2. Involves many (or all) agents, rather than just a few<br>3. Forces other Boarders into your story<br>4.

As far as I know, there has never been a &#39;Secret Emergency&#39; because they&#39;ve always been loud, violent, and drag everyone in HQ into the story. <br><br><b>Not included in this general dislike of Emergencies are missions that involve calling in backup, events with multiple writers (such as the Australian Indoor-Rules Quiddich games), co-written missions, teaming up to deal with a Legendary Badfic such as That Series, etc. </b><br><br>So I think you&#39;d be pretty golden on this thing, as long as you don&#39;t break PPC canon and don&#39;t step on anyone else&#39;s toes.

            <p>...to the mix later, but as I don&#39;t seem to be getting to that yet, I&#39;ll just put in one thing--goyim is a Hebrew word and is actually plural. Goy is singular. You otherwise used it correctly, though :)<br><br>And another language note--people don&#39;t always have the l&#39; attached, so one hears shana tova equally frequently (or more frequently, in my experience). What&#39;s the difference? Shana tova literally means &#39;good year&#39;, and is used as, essentially, &#39;happy new year&#39;. L&#39;shana tova is more in line with &#39;to a good year&#39;--the wording is about how you&#39;d phrase it if you were making a toast: l&#39;shana tova! L&#39;chaim! See? I assume it&#39;s used about the same way as &#39;shana tova&#39;, though--Rats, do please correct me if that&#39;s not how you&#39;ve heard it? Like I said, I&#39;m more used to hearing it as shana tova without the l&#39;.<br><br>/this has been Language Learning with DawnFire.<br><br>Also,Selamat Hari Malaysia one day late! Did you have fun? I know you described in general what people do--did you do anything differently?<br><br>(Also, I get the feeling this is the first time we&#39;ve spoken in a while, which, considering we had some good conversations back in 2013, is a shame.

            <p>My heart is gladdened on this day. The peace of Sabah, Sarawak and most of Malaysian Peninsular lays untouched. There are pockets of unrest, but I&#39;ll explain if everyone&#39;s okay with this place not becoming a flamethrowing river of political banter.<br><br>Sabah is my state in Malaysia, and we mostly spend the day as extra day off, relaxing, enjoying the views, and resting at home, since this year some companies stationed in Indonesia decided it&#39;s a great plan to burn forest fires. The fires causes haze, that aren&#39;t very severe here yet, and affects Indonesia worse. Sorry, Indonesia, I&#39;m not blaming you, in fact, there are someone closer to home that should be responsible.<br><br>As for Sarawak and Peninsular Malaysia, they are warming up to the idea of Malaysia Day. But the celebration is still a little slow.<br><br>Pardon my mistakes in Hebrew, I have yet the opportunity to master such ancient and wise language.<br><br>But in English, do we borrow the plurals as well as the singular? I mean, when I borrow &#39;goyim&#39; into Malay, I will still say &#39;goyim&#39;, despite knowing it&#39;s plural. And in Malay, to plural, we repeat the words. So &#39;goyim&#39; borrowed to Malay becomes &#39;goy-goy&#39;. But we don&#39;t actually do that. We just to find the words that can fit the meaning. So goyim becomes &#39;bukan orang Yahudi&#39;(not the Jewsih people).</p>

            <p>Oh man, you got me started and now I will never stop talking. <br><br>Yep, Rosh Hashanah! It&#39;s a two day holiday, started Sunday night this year and will end tonight. The Jewish calendar itself is lunar based, so every once in a while there&#39;s a leap month (literally just called Adar2, lol) to keep the holidays on track with the seasons they&#39;re supposed to be in! For example, Passover needs to be in spring, while Rosh Hashanah is in the fall. The date was chosen because of the agricultural cycle.<br><br>The holiday itself, while a new year celebration, is also considered part of an atonement time! According to tradition, it&#39;s during the course of Rosh Hashanah that the books of judgement are opened in heaven. Names are recorded into books of &quot;wicked&quot; and &quot;good&quot; or something to that regard, and you have the next ten days (until Yom Kippur next Wednesday!) to reflect on your year and try to remedy or feel sorry for any wrongs you committed. You&#39;re supposed to fast on the day of Yom Kippur, and there&#39;s also this bit I like where you&#39;re supposed to make a paper boat and float it down the river to represent your wrongdoings being washed away. I think? I can&#39;t find any record of that online but I definitely remember learning about it in Hebrew school. :T<br><br>Anyways, with regard to Rosh Hashanah, some traditions include eating round challah bread to represent the circular nature of the year and apples dipped in honey for a sweet new year. Some places have a fish head on the table to symbolize a prayer consisting of &quot;let us be the head (leaders) not the tail (followers)&quot;. You&#39;re also supposed to go to temple and hear a rabbi blow a shofar, which is a hollowed out horn, because it supposedly resembles a baby&#39;s cry and reminds us of our sorrow. Nice stuff haha. . .<br><br>So yeah!! Jewish new year. Good times. <br><br>Malaysia Day! Is that like an independence day, or something else?</p>

            <p>It&#39;s a day to celebrate the formation of Malaysia from the states of Federation of Malay States, Sabah(North Borneo), Sarawak, and once upon a time, Singapore.

            <p>Allow me to tell about my country&#39;s independence. Independence Day here in Brazil is celebrated on September 7th, marking the anniversary of the Cry of Ipiranga, called as such because it happened in the shores of the Ipiranga Brook. This event occured in September 7th of 1822. Basically what happened was that Pedro I, then Prince Royal of the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves, declared independence from Portugal. The official (and somewhat mythical) version of this event can be best illustrated by the painting titled <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_or_Death_(painting)">Independence or Death</a>(which supposedly is what Pedro I shouted when he made the declaration):  <br><br>It is important to note that although Independence Day is celebrated on the date of this event, actual official recognition from Portugal only came about in 1825.  </p>

            <p>Is called Tashlikh. You go to a place with flowing water or the sea, turn your pockets inside out and say a special prayer. It symbolises throwing your sins away.<br>However, this tradition first appeared in 15th century Germany and probably isn&#39;t an original Jewish thing.</p>

            <p>Pieces, that is? That&#39;s what I remember from a while ago, anyway, and some conversations I&#39;ve had with my friends about ducks would seem to confirm it. I get the feeling it&#39;s just a tradition, though--if nothing else, the Artscroll machzor doesn&#39;t mention it that I saw.<br><br>Something cool that I learned this year, though, is that you&#39;re not limited to doing Tashlikh on Rosh Hashana itself--you can do it not only until Yom Kippur, but until <i>Hoshana Rabbah</i>--this year, that&#39;s October 4th. There&#39;s something like a three-week window. And neither I not my parents knew until this year, which explains why we haven&#39;t done it in a while. Wild, huh?<br><br>A bit more information: according, again, to the Artscroll machzor (special prayerbook for the High Holidays, for anyone who doesn&#39;t know and would like to), there are a whole bunch of prayers that you say--close to ten or fifteen, IIRC, though that&#39;s a complete estimate. I&#39;m also pretty sure that outside the Orthodox movement there&#39;s a shorter version--I don&#39;t remember it being *that* long when I was a kid. The Artscroll says the same as Des for Tashlikh&#39;s time of origin, though I think it placed it even earlier (or else just have a more vague description of the time period). And while it&#39;s entirely likely that it was a practice adopted from a different culture, there are certainly reasons for it--I&#39;d have to look again to see what they are, but I think there were two connections made with water and biblical occurrences. Basically--whatever it was originally, if it was adopted from somewhere else then it&#39;s been made quite meaningful.<br><br>~DF</p>

            <p>Okay, so apparently, I have offended some people here on the Board by voicing my opinions on certain matters that, honestly, are highly controversial anyway. <br><br>I&#39;m not going to apologize for having different opinions from apparently everyone else, but I am going to declare an official ceasefire. I&#39;m tired of the arguments, I&#39;m tired of everyone getting mad at me, and I&#39;m tired in general. <br><br>I think the best thing for everyone, then, would be for me to take the rest of the week off from the Board and come back when cooler heads have prevailed. And then, I would ask that political discussions not be brought up here on the Board again, because frankly, it&#39;s against the spirit of the Board&#39;s Constitution in that it&#39;s going to incite heated disagreements, and it will cause people to do and say things that they might normally not do or say.<br><br>To be clear, I am not apologizing. In fact, I feel that I am the one who ought to be apologized to. <br><br>I am a Christian, and that does NOT mean that I despise gay people. It does NOT mean that I support ethnic cleansings, or wars based solely on race. It does NOT mean that I am a bigot. In fact, it&#39;s frankly rather bigoted to assume that I am a bigot, based solely on the fact that I am a Christian. <br><br>I do support Israel&#39;s right to exist, and I love my country based on what it means to be an American, not based on the bad things that we have done in the past. And I certainly will defend the Bible against anyone, even people that I consider friends. It breaks my heart that I would even need to do that, but I am drawing a line in the sand in that respect.<br><br>And I will not hide the fact that I am a Christian, and I will not apologize for it. <br><br>What I do apologize for is allowing this entire, stupid situation to blow out of proportion. I love this community. I really do. But honestly, I feel threatened by this hostile environment that we have all accidentally created over the past day or so. There&#39;s no point in trying to convince me otherwise, because some of the words that have been said to me have been quite hostile to my viewpoint, and I feel, to me personally. <br><br>So I&#39;m going to leave for a little while. I feel saddened that this is necessary, but I&#39;m doing this for the sake of everyone else in this community.<br><br>I&#39;m sorry, everyone, that it has come to this. If we can agree to disagree, then I&#39;ll see everyone in one week&#39;s time. If not... well, let&#39;s leave it at this. I hope we can all work together to move past this.<br><br>Goodbye for now, PPC.<br><br></p>

            <p>I remember mine, it was shortly after I joined, and it was a Free Speech Question.  I may have started slightly reasonable, but it deteriorated very quickly.  It was not my proudest moment.  I was basically making stray arguments and it was, well frankly fact-free.  I knew I was not going to change my mind, and it became clear that the other sides were not going to budge, but instead of being reasonable I resorted to gut and visceral arguments.<br><br>And old bit of advice for attorneys is this.  If the law is on your side, pound the law.  If the facts are on your side, pound the facts.  If neither is on your side, pound the table.  Basically that means, just get angry and impassioned and hope for the best.  <br><br>Though this current argument now in question, there were a few ad hominem towards the end.  And that does make a big difference.  And if I recall your argument earlier this summer never got to the personal attacks.  This one was a bit more personal.</p>

            <p>...but the question of a creator is unscientific. By this I mean it is outside the scope of science.<br>Science advances by disproving things. By the very nature of a creator, it is outside the scope of observation and thus unable to be refuted. For any experiment that could be devised, there are two equally-supported hypotheses: the results are due to laws that came about independently of a creator; or they are due to laws devised by a creator. There cannot be an experiment that separates these two hypotheses. Thus, the existence or non-existence of a creator is not scientific, but philosophical.</p>

            <p>Apologies; I clearly wasn&#39;t thinking straight when I said that.

            <p><i>I am a Christian, and that does NOT mean that I despise gay people.</i><br>Hi there, Mr Straw Man!<br>Dude, nobody made this equivalence. Not a single person said &#39;you&#39;re a Christian; you must be bigoted.&#39; People have been calling you bigoted because you have been expressing bigoted beliefs. (Note: I am not intending to call you a bigot, though I vehemently disagree with your views on gay marriage.)<br>Also: people don&#39;t want you to apologise for having different opinions. They want you to apologise for <i>being rude to them</i>.<br>Other people have covered the other points, but I&#39;ll add that I don&#39;t remember hS ever being offended enough to directly ask for an apology on his own behalf.<br>Oh, and that last bit seems like an appeal to emotion to get us to pity you and go easy on you.

            <p>I was about to type a lengthy reply to the response you made to me on that other post, in a possibly not-very-nice way: systematically picking apart what I see wrong, line by line. I can respect your wish to drop that thread and will not respond there.<br><br>However, I will disagree on one point here. If you think that being gay is a sin, I will consider your opinions bigoted. That is just how I&#39;m going to roll, as a queer Jew who has problems with people trying to impose Christian values on legislative policies and American society as a whole. You&#39;re right that Christian =/= bigot. You are completely entitled to think whatever you want, regardless of your religion, and I can agree to the fact that you are entitled to your opinion and free speech and whatnot. I am equally entitled to be &quot;hostile&quot; to that viewpoint (though I don&#39;t think that was addressing me, specifically, as I did my best to be as non-hostile as possible; if not, please correct me and point out where :&quot;O ) just as your words seem hostile to me. <br><br>I have had zero intention of attacking you as a person because I honestly hate the ad hominem logical fallacy so much. What I will contest is your words and the opinions you express.<br><br>Have a good vacation, and I hope that even if we don&#39;t end up seeing eye-to-eye on this, that we can agree to be cordial towards each other!</p>

            <p>No one wants you to apologize for being Christian. Nor does anyone want you to apologize for being American. Or for being pro-Israel. I think some people would probably like you to apologize for saying their relationship is a sin, but eh, whatever. If you ever change your mind, cool, if not, meh.<br><br>I do take exception to the idea that political threads should be gone - I&#39;ve actually rather enjoyed most of the thread, even the disagreements. Honestly, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s been that hostile. We&#39;ve had far more heated debates - for example when same-sex marriage passed the first time around in the US. I haven&#39;t seen anyone get heated, except when autism came into the conversation - people have just been calling your beliefs into question in ways you dislike, but I have not seen anyone attack you for them, or tell you to stop caring about the Bible or America. Nor has anyone called you a bigot <i>for being a Christian</i>. Multiple people have pointed out to you that <i>they are also Christians</i>, but disagree with you on the definition of sin. That&#39;s been a fact of Christianity for like two thousand years or so.<br><br>I&#39;ll say it one more time: <i>many of the PPC Board members are also Christian, and no one wants you to hide, apologize for, or stop being Christian.</i> Yes, most of us have tried to change your mind on a few fine points of your theology, but that&#39;s not the same as attacking your religion. Hopefully if you read the thread again in a week or so of cooling off, you&#39;ll see what I mean.<br><br>Good luck with the rest of your week-or-so, I&#39;ll see you when the thread falls off the edge.</p>

            <p>I might not seem very good at worldbuilding, but that was due to time constraints IRL. In other words, couldn&#39;t actually post what I really wanted to post. Anyways, onwards to my questions.<br><br>First: Do you think a country could function as a totally efficient, non-corrupt totalitarian dictatorship? As in, every citizen has no value to the state beyond their skills and ability to fight for the system, but &#39;The Man&#39; does provide exactly what all the citizens would need to flourish?<br><br>For example: eight hour work day where you go to an office, do some programming, and try to ignore the cameras and listening devices. Then, the state issues you food, water, fuel for your assigned vehicle,and medical care.<br><br>I&#39;m trying to pose a moral dilemma: Who gets control of the Milky Way? As such, I want no space-nations (not the in-game name) to be true strawmen. All of them could be fairly considered, including the relatively dystopian one. I was thinking that their trains would be the only ones which run on time, and have a guarantee that they won&#39;t be attacked by raiders. Do you think that would be a good enough reason to choose them?<br><br>The reason I&#39;m asking about this faction in particular is because, well, I thought it would be hardest to convince players to choose them. If anyone needs more info, I can provide it.</p>

            <p>This faction, Anarchy LTD, is run by a totally emotionless semi-human CEO, who&#39;s ultimate goal is, essentially, the singularity. They want to elevate people to a whole new level of existence, and in their mindset, anyone who rejects this notion is completely insane, and will be re-educated, reprogrammed, or mindwiped to get the job done. As long as you do your job and don&#39;t spread dissent, you get the single most advanced police and security force genuinely keeping you safe. Anarchy LTD has life insurance, as in, if you die, they will attempt to resurrect you. And this isn&#39;t one-in-ten chance resurrection, either, this is &#39;almost guaranteed to work&#39; resurrection.<br><br>Order is very important to Anarchy LTD, and they use a &quot;perfect&quot; justice system that involves supercomputer and AI simulations, as well as mind-probing. Morality is no concern of theirs, and the most efficient action will always be the one that is taken, no matter how good or evil. If they could spend ten-thousand soldiers, and get enough profit from that spending to make ten-thousand more, plus profit, they would do it in a heartbeat.<br><br>Simply put, nobody else can offer the combination of stability, safety, efficiency, and technology that Anarchy LTD does. The Milky Way is already beset by threats that the other faction may not be able to handle. Plus, a lot of the other factions may not be ready to rule a whole galaxy. Anarchy LTD has two, already, so they have the experience.</p>

            <p>That seems to cover a couple of the major hurdles for this kind of government: you&#39;ve got a non-human, and presumably non-corruptible, individual in charge (like I thought would be required), and you&#39;ve got the &#39;ruthlessly crushing dissent&#39; that hS thought would be necessary for such a system to work. <br><br>My main thought now is that you might want to think about making sure that Anarchy LTD aren&#39;t too powerful in comparison to the other factions.

This implies to me that they are significantly bigger than anyone else, and they&#39;ve got the best weapons and armour (and all sorts of other stuff, but it&#39;s the military that will become relevant in a moment). They also display genocidical tendencies (&#39;in their mindset, anyone who rejects this [attempt to trigger the singularity] notion is completely insane, and will be re-educated, reprogrammed, or mindwiped&#39;), so why haven&#39;t they wiped out / enslaved / converted everyone else yet?

            <p>A totally efficient, non-corrupt totalitarian dictatorship.  This almost sounds sounds like you are setting up something similar to how the Soviet Union was (in theory) or even the Third Reich (again in theory) was supposed to be.  I think then the answer is very similar to what Irish said.  We have seen such a fictional representation, the Empire from Star Wars was very much the Third Reich in Space.<br><br>But the ultimate answer is anything could work from a theoretical standpoint if written well enough.  But unless you establish your citizens as different, what ultimately will happen is people will project.  And one such projection is absolute power corrupts absolutely.  Now if you want to avoid strawmen, a way to do that would be make all your nations equally corrupt, just have it manifest in ways.<br><br>We do need to know a bit more about what you are actually going for to determine if your reasons are sufficient.  However, if you want to make a sympathetic dictatorship, I do recommend you look at the Empire from Star Wars.  Look at what makes them so popular.  For example you could, as I think you state in another post, show that the galaxy is very dangerous and war is a common occurrence.  There may be little in the way of personal freedoms, but this dictatorship has the only military truly capable of keeping its people safe. <br><br>Another approach you could do is look to earlier examples, such as the Roman Empire.  Add and flesh out the culture of this dictatorship.  Maybe they were or are a center of intergalactic trade.  Maybe the greatest artisans of this era come from this dictatorship (a stretch sure, but it could work).  Maybe they have the greatest minds in the galaxy.  These are things you could give this dictatorship to make them more sympathetic and not a strawman.  <br><br>I would like to know more about what you are trying to do.  Without straight comparisons it will be hard to help you right now.</p>

            <p>I don&#39;t believe that a country could function with such a government, because I don&#39;t believe it would be possible to form such a government. Even if you could find a morally upstanding and totally incorruptible person (maybe you get an A.I. to do the job) you&#39;re still relying on <i>every other person</i> in the system to have those same levels of moral fortitude or corruption is going to sneak in. <br><br>&#39;Can an efficient, <s>non-corrupt</s> totalitarian dictatorship be effective leadership?&#39; Yes. Fiction has shown us many examples, such as the Empire from <i>Star Wars</i> (for all I know there are real life examples too). <br><br>As to whether I would choose these guys... well, that depends on what type of game you&#39;re talking about (can&#39;t see any indication of that). If you&#39;re talking about a space-based RTS, then the fluff saying that their trains run on time and they have no crime doesn&#39;t sound like it&#39;s going to be that relevant/important. If, on the other hand, you&#39;re talking about an immersive RPG then not being attacked by muggers in the city streets sounds like a good bonus. <br><br>Also, the perks that are available for the other choices make a difference here. If these guys have an OK bonus, but the others all get brilliant ones, then these guys aren&#39;t going to get chosen much. It&#39;s not so much about providing a good enough reason to choose one faction, as it is about providing balanced reasons for choosing any of them. <br><br>If you want a more detailed answer, you&#39;ll have to provide some info on what type of game you&#39;re thinking of, and what my other choices for faction are. <br><br>- Irish </p>

            <p>To get an effective totalitarian dictatorship without mind-control, you need to be utterly ruthless in crushing dissent. You need to see it the instant it starts, and eliminate the people involved. You need cameras literally everywhere; you make tampering with the cameras a capital offense; you execute anyone who does anything to undermine the system.<br><br><a href="http://observationdeck.kinja.com/in-fact-in-all-of-the-multiverse-the-only-universe-tha-1722431022">Per Doctor Doom:</a><br><br><i>&quot;In <b>one</b> possible future, mankind becomes united. Cures for all diseases are found. Global conflict ends. Hunger is abolished, education is universal, and no-one goes without.<br><br>&quot;In <b>that</b> world, there are laws. To break even the slightest of these is to suffer immediate and terminal punishment. After a while, no-one would dare lay hands upon the innocent, or commit a crime of hate, or steal bread from the table of another.<br><br>&quot;Ten thousand futures have I looked at. A hundred thousand. And in only one does mankind finally unite, and flourish... and survive.<br><br>&quot;Only one.<br><br>&quot;<b>Doomworld</b>.&quot;</i><br><br>... but I&#39;m not sure you can swing anyone on that. :D<br><br>An alternate model is the Radchaai Empire from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancillary_Justice">Ancillary Justice</a>/Sword/Mercy books (I don&#39;t think the third one is out yet). They use &#39;reeducation&#39; to remove criminals - it operates by making the thing they did wrong physically and mentally painful for them to do. One character was reeducated for anger issues, and now has to stay calm or double over in pain.<br><br>As a way of &#39;lightening&#39; a dictatorship by removing the death penalty, it could work, though you&#39;ll still have to talk fast to make people accept it. The fact that it doesn&#39;t involve mind-wiping, but just hard-wired controls, will probably help.

            <p>Raiders, space pirates and the like have become major issues for the galaxy due to a massive understaffing in the Gem Armada (The guys who USED to keep the peace). In fact, they&#39;ve been forced to accept fully blooded gang members just to keep up with troop demand. In short, they&#39;re well meaning, but the old guard, who were the &#39;real&#39; good guys are gone. So, it&#39;s up to the player if they want to leave the galaxy to these people.<br><br>On the other hand, there are no raiders, pirates, or really crime of any kind in Anarchy LTD. That&#39;s the totalitarian government, by the way. They also have two galaxies under their rule already, as well as the most advanced tech in the setting, so they know what they&#39;re doing when it comes to efficient government.<br><br>There will be two additional factions in the final product, as well. One of them is a culture of insane Klingons crossed with football hooligans. The other one is a &#39;workers paradise&#39; that actually delivers on that promise. If this seems like a ramble, do forgive. I had to wake up early, and caffeine does strange things to me.</p>

            <p>Short answer: not really, in my opinion? Hmm.<br><br>Long answer: there will always be a group of people in a situation like this who are against the totalitarian dictatorship aspect, no matter how non-corrupt. If &quot;every citizen has no value to the state beyond their skills and ability to fight for the system&quot;, there is inevitably going to be a group of people who are deemed invaluable but are also angry enough about it to fight that designation!<br><br>That&#39;s just what I&#39;m getting from what you wrote; could&#39;ve definitely misread!

            <p><a href="http://ppc-posting-board-2-proto.herokuapp.com/">T-Board</a>, the prototype replacement Board system, has been polished up a bit. It&#39;s now in a state where&#39;d I&#39;d be willing to spin up an actual test instance.<br><ul>
<br><li>Updated to Rails 4.2 and Bootstrap 3 (aka, technical mumbo-jumbo)</li>
<br><li>Added spoiler tags (Nameless Admin, the CSS for those can be found <a href="https://github.com/TechnoDann/PPC-board-2.0/blob/master/app/assets/stylesheets/posts.scss#L73">here</a> and is portable. If added, the syntax would be &lt;a href=&quot;#s&quot; title=&quot;Text to be hidden&quot;&gt;Spoiler text&lt;/a&gt;)</li>
<br><li>Removed the &quot;Author (posted by Real Username)&quot; thing. Instead, if you click on the author&#39;s name when looking at a post, you get taken to their user page, which shows their real username and email. This seems like a better approximation to the quasi-anonymity of this Board than the old system</li>
<br><li>Old bugs fixed, new ones inevitably introduced. Bug reports and other feedback welcome</li>
<br>
</ul>
<br>P.S. Search doesn&#39;t work because of limitations of our hosting provider.</p>

            <p>Not sure if this has come up before, but how many posts is T-Board capable of holding before old ones get deleted?<br><br>I&#39;m sure that when I joined the PPC this current Board held posts from several years back, now it only seems to go back about 2 years. We still have the archives, but they&#39;re a lot harder to read than the Board.<br><br>So if we did start using T-Board, how far back would the board records go? I&#39;m assuming it would be a case of &#39;total number of posts&#39; rather than time thing (i.e. once a thread is over 2 years old it gets deleted). <br><br>- Irish</p>

            <p>The main limits are<br>- Disk space (all the posts in the archive are around 50 MB, IIRC)<br>- The machine integer (since every post needs a unique ID). This is either 2<sup>31</sup>-1 or 2<sup>63</sup>-1, both of which are really huge numbers. (I&#39;d have to look up how big the post IDs are)<br>- The place I&#39;m hosting now (because it&#39;s free) has a 10k database row limit, which is pretty low. If we put the Board somewhere less annoying, this won&#39;t apply.<br><br>Also, the awkward spreadsheets are just one representation of the archives. Their canonical form is a not very human readable data dump that&#39;s meant to be imported into a T-Board installation. (The T-Board code has scripts for creating these dumps, importing them, and making .csv files out of them)</p>

            <p>So you can&#39;t scroll up and down the T-Board using the arrow keys.  Is this intentional or not?  I can&#39;t think of a particular reason why it would be.

<li>You have global edit (and ban) access because I set your mod flag years ago.<br><br>- That was intentional on my part. Can&#39;t have the Shadowy Cabal of Mods (tm) editing posts left and right without a trace :). Do note, that if you go look at the previous version and click the username, you see the actual author.<br><br>- I think we can have up to 2^31 - 1 user IDs and posts.

            <p>Lazygrace am lazy, but here&#39;s Voyd&#39;s Ice-type Gym. Enjoy!<br><br>---<br><br><b>The Gym:</b><br>It&#39;s full of monsters! And not of the pocket variety, either! Well, that&#39;s a bit of a misnomer; the enormous ice palace, modelled after a traditional shrine high in the mountains, is a place of pilgrimage for Pokemon and their fans alike. The cold mountain air is soothing and refreshing, and the gym itself is very sedate, a place to be with the Pokémon you love. Leader Voyd doesn&#39;t take battling very seriously unless he has to, preferring instead to train his team through gentle nurture and unshakeable friendship. Just don&#39;t let him near Arbok. They, er, they like him a little <i>too</i> much.<br><br><b>The Team (postgame):</b><br>Mega Glalie @ Glalitite<br>Inner Focus --&gt; Refrigerate<br>Double-Edge<br>Freeze-Dry<br>Earthquake<br>Explosion<br><br>Rotom-Frost @ Magnet<br>Levitate<br>Thunderbolt<br>Blizzard<br>Confuse Ray<br>Dark Pulse<br><br>Abomasnow @ Icy Rock<br>Snow Warning<br>Swords Dance<br>Seed Bomb<br>Ice Shard<br>Rock Slide<br><br>Cloyster @ Focus Sash<br>Skill Link<br>Shell Smash<br>Icicle Spear<br>Rock Blast<br>Spike Cannon<br><br>Mamoswine @ Life Orb<br>Thick Fat<br>Earthquake<br>Ice Shard<br>Knock Off<br>Icicle Crash<br><br>Cryogonal @ Never Melt Ice<br>Levitate<br>Rapid Spin<br>Hidden Power Fire<br>Freeze-Dry<br>Recover<br><br><b>The Phat Lewts:</b><br>The Gennep badge is a reference, I promise. To what would spoil the surprise. However, your other prize is TM79 Frost Breath, one that only refers to you having had a lovely time in the cold mountain air, and Leader Voyd&#39;s hope that you come back again some time.</p>

            <p><s>still waiting on my Flying-type gym btw</s><br><br>To those who have agents, missions, plans for missions, etc... If you could create a Pokemon team based on the agents you have so far (can be fewer than six), which Pokemon would you choose to represent each of your agents and why?<br><br>Falchion would be a Skarmory of course, Rashida would probably be a Persian (too bad it doesn&#39;t get Future Sight), Ripper would be an Archeops because feathered dinosaurs, and then among the other of my RCs I&#39;d go with Cupid as a Togekiss, Sarah as a Staraptor, and maaaaaybe E.V.L. as a Mismagius.<br><br>Miscellaneous choices would be Rayner the Zebstrika (pity it&#39;s got sucky stats), Lapis the Horsea (or maybe a Lapras, or even a Sharpedo? IDK), Salvo the Electrode, Feratu the Crobat, and of course, Brenda the Rapidash.<br><br>Heh. All but two of my choices are Flying-type, but type coverage be damned.

            <p>The badge reference is that the founder of the idea of liminality of experience in history was Arnold van Gennep, though the cause was more enthusiastically taken up by Victor Turner, who I&#39;ve been studying as part of my degree. As for the Arbok thing, that was more a reference to the main character of the show&#39;s, er, interesting dynamic with his impromptu serpentine roommate. There are other ones in there, scattered throughout; the emphasis on Japanese culture (mountain shrines being rather common in Shinto and Buddhist traditions) and the idea of being very good friends with your team being a less explicit version of the show&#39;s central harem comedy dynamic.</p>

            <p>Oh Celestia, it&#39;s cookie clicker for sharks. Thank you. This is the best.<br><br>I do kinda hope it could be updated to have cookie clicker like graphics. This game does not give you the same feeling of accomplishment these kind of games desperately need. When progression is your only mechanic, you need to have that progression feel good. Make it an accomplishment of its own to add another shark to your school. Each and every grandma in cookie clicker gives you a strong sense of acomplishment just by <s>enslaving</s> hiring one. Short of that, this is a solid clicker game, that I am interested to see where it goes.</p>

            <p>As in, accidentally starting an argument about tone, causing people to argue? I certainly hope no circular arguments, that is, points that circle back around to the beginning of a debate, have been made or said.<br>(Be right back, I need to call the DRD on myself. And, it&#39;s not my fault if you read orangism as something else.)</p>

            <p>First I&#39;ll start by saying there seems to be a whole lot of arguing going on below this, so I&#39;ll just get right to the story, which is frankly what people should be focusing on.<br><br>I&#39;m just going to come out and say it.  I like this story a lot.  After an early moment of confusion (I&#39;ll touch that in a bit) it was enjoyable.  I have seem a few comments about tone.  I loved the tone.  I love when we see something that breaks the mold, the impression I often have gotten through discussions and stories and such, was often &quot;It must be funny or it&#39;s bad&quot;.  This idea always kind of irritated me, because every writer has a different style, and not everyone can write a funny story, and not everyone wants to write comedy.  This is a fantastic example of a story that  was well written, dealt with mature themes, and frankly was not funny (at least I did not think so).  <b>This is not a bad thing</b>.  Comedy is not the end all be all.<br><br>Now on to the part of confusion.  Very early on I got confused because in one paragraph you were using gender neutral pronouns.  I was not sure who it was referring to.  Further keep in mind not everyone knows gender neutral pronouns.  I actually had to look it up to confirm it.  Since it really came up in only one paragraph, my question is, do you really even need it?  Just my thoughts on that.<br><br>Now final remarks on whatever seems to be going on below.  From what I gather it seems that you want to resign as a PG because a few people did not think the tone was adequate.  In the most bluntest form, I say screw them.  First tone is the author&#39;s choice.  Are you satisfied with the tone?  If yes, then that&#39;s all that matters.  I also think that going into a less expected tone/genre/etc.  is the mark of a truly talented writer.  I think tactically that was the right choice.  I would even go so far as to say, that if this piece were humorous, it would not have worked. <br><br>Now time for a bit of a soapbox with regards to tone.  I am all for opening the PPC community as a whole to &quot;darker&quot; tones.  If someone wants to write something that is heavy on dramatic elements and low on humor, I say go for it.  I think we can classify the PPC as a long-runner now.  These things need to evolve, or they will stagnate.  I think accepting &quot;darker&quot; toned pieces is a good decision.  This is not the time for that debate so I will say no more about that.<br><br>But back to the resignation, I see absolutely no reason to do it.       </p>

            <p>Please reread my first response. <br><br>&quot;That said, I don&#39;t personally like the direction being taken with the PPC here. <br><br>To me, at least, it&#39;s much too harsh.&quot;<br><br>This has <i>nothing</i> to do with the matter of tone. It has to do with an actual direction of things changing towards being authoritarian, to borrow the word. <br><br>His Elflordliness Huinesoron has written dark things set in the universe of the PPC. I have written things that are not comedy, and have dealt with mature issues. We are not saying &#39;no, everything must be funny&#39;.<br><br>This has to do with the direction of taking something in the PPC itself in a direction that is <i>against</i> things that have been set previously as precedent for years.<br><br>This means that either there is a breaking of PPC-canon, or that things are going in an unsavory direction in-universe.<br><br>The second is the thing we are taking issue with. <br><br>There is a reason that we both listed a bunch of agents who had done similarly (without getting the book thrown at them). There is a reason that hS wrote the ficlet response that he did- which actually features and talks about agents that were involved in his HQ-focused series that had to do with the Department of Internal Security, which used to do the thing that the DIA is pulling in this story! His miniresponse is quite serious in tone because that&#39;s what was called for!<br><br>There is breaking the mold. This is when you do something new.<br><br>There is breaking the canon. This is when you are going against what has been previously established.<br><br>This was the second.<br><br>There is nothing wrong with having darker tones present in the PPC. But the PPC is not a &quot;grimdark&quot; universe. We charge for discordant tones and going against the themes of a canon at times for a reason. Needless to say, it goes for the PPC and people who write in this shared universe as well. </p>

            <p>Is that perhaps the canon can, and perhaps should evolve.  I am also not going to go any further into this debate.  There is a time and a place for that, and this was supposed to be me congratulating the writers on a story that I think was well written and quite enjoyable.  I will also admit that I did not thoroughly read the responses pertaining to this debate, because I only wanted to briefly touch upon it.  Otherwise I would have thrown my two cents directly into that debate.  The final thing I will say here is that you seem to have two choices.  Keep it the same or its going in the wrong direction.  I think there are multiple options.  I also personally like this direction because I enjoy seeing internal conflict.  It makes it seem more realistic.<br><br>But because I do not want to derail this any further, I thought this was not only well written, but I enjoyed it.  <b>I for one am looking forward for how this arc plays out. </b></p>

            <p>I apologize ahead of time if what I&#39;m about to say seems harsh; as I typically say at the head of these reviews, it&#39;s never my intention to insult or belittle. I&#39;ve been thinking about this for a while now. A lot of what I&#39;m about to say is going to be extremely subjective. You are free to accept or dismiss it as you like.<br><br>This piece… I was not a fan of it. The stuff with the Reader interacting with the TARDIS was interesting, but kind of awkward to read. The highlight was the scene with Alex Dives, beyond a doubt. It was both emotional and very solidly written. But the rest of the story felt very slow to me.<br><br>I&#39;m honestly a little tired of reading about the various PPC Time Lords and Ladies bemoaning their fate and that of Gallifrey. That was one of the various reasons why I stopped watching <i>Doctor Who</i>. It felt like there was a lot of that here. I understand they have a lot to complain about and are justified in doing so, but that particular drum has been beat so much that I&#39;ve stopped caring.<br><br>And then we come to the Aviator/Rina Dives. Forgive me for saying, but I don&#39;t like this character any more.<br><br>It started when she changed from a human into a Time Lord. I was not a fan of that particular decision. At the time, I thought it was a cheap means to avoid killing a character. You get the emotionality of death without the otherwise required baggage. I didn&#39;t raise a fuss about it, however, because I trusted in Iximaz&#39;s writing abilities. I thought she might do something new with the concept.<br><br>As time went on and more bad things happened to the Aviator/Rina, I became less interested in the character. I have no problem with characters who suffer. On the contrary, I would argue that its very much necessary. Without a struggle, there can be no triumph. The character will neither evolve nor change. But this suffering should have a point beyond &quot;to make the audience feel pity.&quot; I did not get that with the Aviator/Rina. It just seemed to me like she was getting hit with problem after problem just so readers would go &quot;aww, poor thing.&quot; She didn&#39;t win; she didn&#39;t evolve. Maybe she did and I missed it, but that&#39;s what it felt like to me. That is not interesting.<br><br>I was honestly kind of excited when it seemed like she was going to be gone for good — or at the very least, for a sizable amount of time. Maybe there would be some stories about her partner going solo, or working with someone new. I thought at the very least she would come back with a better grasp on life and herself. But I was incorrect.<br><br>I also want to touch on the comparisons between A/R and the Doctor. They popped up both in the fic&#39;s author notes and in the comments here. Part of the reason why I think the character no longer gels with me is that she stopped being herself and started being a disjointed expy of the Doctor. Let the Doctor be the Doctor, and let A/R be A/R.<br><br>Finally, I want to comment on some of the things that July said. I think that she is correct in her assessment of this portrayal of the PPC. I think it would help if we had some more stories about the DIA to tone them down a bit (get on that, Ekyl!). That being said, I do not agree with your decision to immediately give up your PG-ship. You&#39;re a very good writer; one of the better ones in this community, I would argue. But even good writers are not immune to mistakes. That is no reason to resign.<br><br>But that&#39;s ultimately your decision. Think on it for a while, at the very least.</p>

            <p>&quot;Hey, love.&quot;<br><br>Steve looked up and waved. &quot;Heya. How are the kids?&quot;<br><br>Tango chuckled. &quot;Luden&#39;s been busy explaining that his white hair makes him <i>better</i> than everyone else, Jason&#39;s been playing &#39;Hunt the Snark&#39; with the Telcontar girls, and Aaron... last I saw him, was trying to headbutt his way through a wall.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Pretty much normal, then.&quot; Steve reached up and held his wife&#39;s hand over his shoulder. &quot;What brings you here, then? Nyx busy?&quot;<br><br>&quot;She&#39;s got a cowrite with someone from Elven Linguistics, so I&#39;m at loose ends.&quot;<br><br>Steve frowned. &quot;She&#39;s got a <i>what</i>?&quot;<br><br>&quot;A... what do you call it when you get sent off to work with a one-time partner?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Oh, that. Haven&#39;t a clue. Special assignment?&quot;<br><br>&quot;That&#39;ll do.&quot; Tango glanced at the console screen. &quot;So what&#39;s in the news today?&quot;<br><br>Steve grinned. &quot;Which one? The <i>Monitor</i> says the Troupe By Any Other Name got caught in a Quiddich match, and are now second place in the league. The <i>Real Monitor</i>,&quot; he waved a sheet of colourful paper, &quot;is yelling about two of the Yellow Roses swapping identities. <i>PPC Radio</i> are still going on about that body-swap thing, <i>Radio Nutmeg</i> &#39;won&#39;t believe how hilarious these 10 Bad Slash mission reports are&#39;, the-&quot;<br><br>&quot;Etcetera, etcetera.&quot; Tango tapped on the screen. &quot;But what about the <i>real</i> news?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Oh, on the network? Mm...&quot; Steve pulled up the bulletin boards. &quot;Looks like... oh, you remember that Dives girl?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Uh... failed to kill her partner and ran away?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Something like that. Apparently she&#39;s back and in DIA custody. There&#39;s a recording...&quot;<br><br>The video was small and greyscale, showing a nondescript corridor. Tango frowned. &quot;Is that DIA Central?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Can&#39;t be.&quot; Steve scanned the message the footage was attached to. &quot;But is. I guess this Ghost chap has connections.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yes, dangerous ones. So what-?&quot; Tango fell silent as two DIA agents appeared on screen. There was no sound, but someone had helpfully subtitled the video:<br><br><i>I have calculated the probability of certain verdicts. I must admit that her future career is looking rather bleak...</i><br><br>The two Assassins watched the video through until the officers left the screen (<i>Cancellation of accu...</i>). Then they watched it again. And again.<br><br>&quot;Steve,&quot; Tango said, her voice almost dreamy, &quot;can you look up what the Dives girl was accused of?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I... yes.&quot; Steve tapped away, hauling up the relevant edition of the <i>Multiverse Monitor</i>. &quot;Theft of a TARDIS, interfering with a canon &#39;verse, dereliction of duty, damaging public property, and endangering agents&#39; lives.&quot;<br><br>&quot;That&#39;s... roughly what I remembered. Um.&quot; Tango drummed her fingers on the console. &quot;This... I don&#39;t like the look of this.&quot;<br><br>&quot;It does sound a bit like overkill,&quot; Steve agreed. &quot;A tracking bracelet, probable imprisonment, and no pay? For making off with a TARDIS we stole to begin with?&quot;<br><br>Tango&#39;s lip twisted. &quot;Steve... you do remember <i>I</i> stole PPC technology, abandoned my job, and ran off into a canon world, yes?&quot;<br><br>Steve stared at the video, frozen on the last view of the DIA officers. &quot;You think they&#39;re going to come after you next?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Don&#39;t I have a <i>right</i> to worry?&quot; Tango gripped the edge of the console with both hands. &quot;I do <i>not</i> want to go back into the clutches of PPC security.&quot;<br><br>Steve pressed a hand over his wife&#39;s. &quot;If they come for you,&quot; he said, &quot;I&#39;ll get you out. I promise.&quot; He smiled lopsidedly. &quot;I did last time, didn&#39;t I?&quot;<br><br>Tango shook his hand off. &quot;It&#39;s not just about me, though.&quot; She waved at the door, at the rest of HQ. &quot;Nyx set off high explosives across half the multiverse. Your old partner broke canonical laws of death. Half of DOGA got there by setting canons on fire. Blue - I know they couldn&#39;t exactly arrest him now, but they have exorcism capability, I&#39;m sure they do.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Tang&#39;, none of those...&quot; Steve took a breath, started over. &quot;I know this looks bad, but the Dives girl has a lot more charges piled on her than any of you did-&quot;<br><br>&quot;<i>Ontic.</i>&quot;<br><br>&quot;... they said she was fine now.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Whereas Dives is still compulsively stealing TARDISes and running away? I heard that was a one-off, a snap.&quot;<br><br>Steve tried to force a laugh. &quot;The Flowers should be thankful she didn&#39;t take a flamethrower to them.&quot;<br><br>&quot;And if she had, they&#39;d have sent her to FicPsych. Not locked her up and thrown away the key.&quot; Tango&#39;s face hardened. &quot;At least - that&#39;s what they would have done <i>before</i>.&quot;<br><br>Steve stared at the console, at the frozen video, at the news of Dives&#39; return, and her immediate arrest. &quot;We should do something.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yes.&quot; A beat. &quot;What?&quot;<br><br>&quot;... I don&#39;t know.&quot;<br><br><hr>
<br><br>There are a lot of people who have bad, bad memories of the last time the PPC&#39;s security apparatus <a href="http://ppchistory.webs.com/ReorgPart1.htm#chapter2">went about arresting people in public</a>.<br><br>I really liked the writing in this story; I thought all the characters&#39; reactions were spot-on, and that the Aviator was convincingly heartbreaking. I really, really want to believe that your plan is to use the incident to have the Board of Flowers slap down the increasingly authoritarian DIA, in a beautifully-written trialogue between the Sunflower Official, Tiger Lily, and Guardsman, in which the Lily starts off by defending her department, but ends up being persuaded by the SO (and dare I hope, the Sub Rosa?) and promising massive changes. I think that would be a genuinely good way to cap and end this arc - by showing that the PPC <i>isn&#39;t</i> the unfeeling police-state its agents are coming to believe it is, and that when the Flowers are presented with a &#39;justice or mercy?&#39; choice like this one, they will come down on the side of mercy.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Assuming I could write that (hell, it&#39;s a pretty big assumption that I can <i>write</i>), I would get started on that immediately. It would certainly work well as a capstone to this whole business, and there&#39;s definitely potential for comedy here as well as a big happy ending. For instance, I am imagining the Reader sitting in the public gallery with a placard reading:<br><br>FREE THE <s>GALLIFREYAN</s><br><s>OLYESTIAN</s><br><s>EARTHESE</s><br><s>FORMERLY HUMAN</s><br><s>SOMEWHERE IN THE MIDWESTIAN</s><br>RC 3-APPLE-14 ONE!

Hm... it&#39;s almost like an anti-Emergency, if we get enough people on it. A statement of intent: the PPC is not for those who think it&#39;s a police state, or who would like it to be one.<br><br>Come to think of it, Statement Of Intent would be a pretty good title for it too. =]</p>

But you have some points.<br><br>First, as Ekyl stated, Rina is in a <i>holding cell.</i> A place of temporary confinement before she is put to trial. She has Fic Psych personnel attempting to work on her vast psychological issues while she is in said holding cell, and she is to be given a fair trial by an impartial jury (and judges, but as you stated, they have been gentle before). What about this screams police state again? The fact they had guns out when she arrived? Yes, let&#39;s approach an unknown TARDIS, a favored mode of transportation by many Sues and renegade Time Lords, with a holstered baton and a cop of tea. (That was meant to be cup, but seeing how we are talking internal police, the typo stays) The fact they used a pair of handcuffs to escort her away? So, what, just because she is an agent means she gets to skip on by without retribution of any sort? She snapped, who knows how demented she may or may not be. The cuffs are probably for her safety, as much as everyone else&#39;s. That she is in a holding cell? That boggles my mind. When in the history of ever has anybody objected to the use of a temporary holding cell, as long as the trial was relatively quick to follow. And she is heading off in a mere few days. That is pretty darn speedy to me. So, tell me, where has the DIA turned into a police state again? When did they &quot;lock her up and throw away the key&quot;? Why must the whole darn thing be disbanded for doing their jobs, and being rather merciful while doing so. <br><br>That all being said, there is one glaring issue, that does need addressing. The list of punishments and their likelihood. Mandatory time within ficpsych, removal of stolen TARDIS, and increased mission load would be the standard punishment. Perhaps the Flowers would understand the mission overload is what caused her to snap in the first place, and drop that punishment. Forcibly removing her new identity, the one she has spent centuries in, would be far beyond what they would ever even consider, much less the insinuation that this is the direction they will go. If that section were removed, and replaced with one of the nurses performing some psychological evaluations, I don&#39;t think we would be having any problems.<br><br>That all being said, this was very well written. It makes me sad that because of a very good story that took a turn some people disagree with, Iximaz may well step down as PG. Ix, I implore you, do reconsider. This story does not define how you see the PPC. Does not say anything about your ability to judge people&#39;s ability to write within it. Hold your hat high, be proud of what you wrote, and be thoughtful of where you go next.</p>

            <p>You mean... the only issue I did in fact address?<br><br>The only information Steve and Tango have is 1/ the list of charges, which I&#39;ve glossed as being listed in the Monitor after she left, 2/ the fact that she was arrested, and 3/ the conversation between the Guardsman and Terabyte. They <i>don&#39;t even know she&#39;s in a cell</i>. &#39;lock her up and throw away the key&#39; is a direct reference to the line about the probability of long-term incarceration being 60%.

            <p>-r that &quot;incarceration&quot; could also mean inpatient treatment at FicPsych, which is more likely in Rina&#39;s case than actually being sent back to the jail. I&#39;m sure that&#39;s a thing they <i>can</i> do, but when there&#39;s as wide a range of options as is available to the Board and DIA, it&#39;s pretty rare in practise. Most people who do things that would require that are probably sent to FicPsych instead - and to spend a term in there of any substantial length, you probably have to have done something <i>really</i> bad, like outright murder people. <br><br>That is, admittedly, just off the cuff spitballing at the moment though. I&#39;d have to mull this over for future writing. </p>

            <p>Is that the DIA is just holding on to her until the BoDH decides what&#39;s to be done. Though again, I probably should&#39;ve pushed more for it to be clearer that FicPsych was a much likelier outcome than locking anybody up &quot;and throwing away the key&quot;. <br><br>As for whether &quot;police exist&quot; means the PPC is turning into an unfeeling police state, as the person who sort of introduced the new state of the DIA with the intention of trying to go interesting places with it (I know, I know, I haven&#39;t written a bloody thing in 5 years; I keep meaning to...), I&#39;d rather like the chance to do something with the concept rather than have it all be thrown away. I should probably hurry up and, you know, actually write stuff, but the way I&#39;ve always envisioned the department, they&#39;re emphatically trying to find a balance where they&#39;re effectively defending HQ and its populace <i>without</i> turning into the DIS.<br><br>Not to mention that, alarmist rhetoric aside, these situations presented are rather different. Though in hindsight the way the arrest is written comes off a bit... abrupt? I would have to think on how I&#39;d&#39;ve justified it if I was writing it.</p>

            <p>In honesty, the possibility wasn&#39;t something that occurred to me because, in HQ, how would it work?

            <p>I&#39;ll give you all this: it was well written.  You guys did an excellent job on that matter. I certainly felt for the Reader and for the Aviator and everyone else. You did an excellent job of setting up the stage, there. <br><br>That said, I don&#39;t personally like the direction being taken with the PPC here. <br><br>To me, at least, it&#39;s much too harsh. <br><br>You&#39;re implying a level of ruthlessness I don&#39;t like,  and one that, quite frankly,  isn&#39;t generally seen in the spin-offs I like best. The Flowers, for the most part, don&#39;t indulge in a theatre of cruelty. The organization is ragtag; the PPC, in-universe, consists of outsiders. People who fell off the face of their home canons and worlds, people who wandered in by mistake and decided to stay. People who  embraced the weirdness and chaotic. Plenty who embraced another life outside the margins. Not just the agents, but the Flowers too, if you choose to take Origins as canon as well. <br><br>Badfic missions are terrible yes, and wear on agents. But think of it this way: you, you lot aren&#39;t the first ones to write an agent having snapped, or the first one coming back. I realize that to you, Ixi, and co, that the arc is an important one. But I think you are blowing the response up far out of proportion when previous spin-offs had...<br><br>-hm.<br><br>Off the top of my head: Huinesoron&#39;s DoGA missions having Constance forcibly pry Dafydd back from the death whether anyone agreed with it or no.  Result? Retirement, lots of shouting, but them still being able to come back to HQ with no problem and even choosing to keep their kids involved in the general PPC HQ culture. <br><br>Nume&#39;s former lunatic partner Cameo only being kept probably permanently in FicPsych despite being Cameo.<br><br>FR of Cupcakes fame having snapped and trying to kill his partner, but only being put through FicPsych for it before returning to duty.<br><br>And of course my Agent July, who racked up several of the same charges as Rina/Ave there, except with purposefully returning to HQ after having attacked someone, minus the Time Lordness and TARDIS. She got a stern talking to and told to go to therapy in FicPsych.<br><br>There are plenty more. <br><br>This is not an institution of rules and enforcement of that ilk. I remember one short story not too long ago that Huinesoron commented on and said similarly: the DIA in this is coming off terrifyingly harsh, and- here&#39;s where you should worry, considering whom it is coming from- <i>militaristic</i>. If that was your overall intent, well done, but I will have to vehemently disagree with this rendition of the DIA.  <br><br>Your making as big a deal of this as it is, when compared with the previous mentions, makes me concerned about what it is exactly you are doing. We have spoken. I know your intent is not to make the Aviator Overly Special. But with the above in mind, that is what is happening with this story arc. There are already plenty of examples where agents running off into foreign parts, and sometimes tramping through things while having gone crazy is something that is accepted that happens, and treatment is given, if they choose to stay or aren&#39;t capable of making that decision. What happens in response is missions. The Flowers don&#39;t have much understanding of humanoids and humanity. Agents don&#39;t have much understanding of the Flowers That Be. Explicit sadism is something that tends to result in an unpleasant end. <br><br>I know you&#39;re trying something different. But I definitely do not like the PPC the Aviator returned to, and it is not one I write in, and I&#39;m not in agreement with the choices you have made here for her arc and how it has turned out.<br><br>-Regretfully, a July</p>

            <p>First of all - I understand you never said <i>Brink</i> was bad and/or poorly written. This is not the case here.<br><br>Next, I believe both you and Ixi are overreacting about the entire issue. She thinks she messed up bad and is trying to revoke her PG Hat for completely no reason, while you feel like she stepping over the bounds of what the PPC is supposed to be. But does anyone really know what it is supposed to be? This it is not as, like you said, &quot;ragtag&quot; as it originally was, but things are bound to change; people are maturing, the Organization itself develops.<br><br>It is the same thing as <i>Doctor Who</i> and <i>The Sarah Jane Adventures</i> - one more dark, one more G-rated. The PPC started as SJA and is slowly turning into DW. Yes, I know the original principle of the Organization: comedy, chaos, and a happy bunch of misfits, but this will not always be the case.<br><br>This is why the missions are spin-offs - different from the original and your vision of the PPC will always be different than, let&#39;s say, my vision of the PPC. Unless you&#39;re hoping to create some kind of position that will decide if the missions are kept in-check with one, decided version? On a sidenote, July, you may want to double-check your wording because you really made it sound negative. One line struck me in particular:<br><br>&quot;<i>I am  not sure I like this because of the extremes the DIA are going to, which is results in a PPC I would not want to write in.</i>&quot;<br><br>Don&#39;t you feel the &#39;Write-This-Like-I-Want-Or-I&#39;ll-Quit&#39; vibe coming from this? Because I kinda do.<br><br>***<br><br>Now, for the DIA itself, let&#39;s check the Department&#39;s functions according to the wiki, shall we?<br><br>&quot;<i>The DIA&#39;s patrol division are known to keep watch on agents who are a little too trigger-happy (...)</i>&quot;<br><br>Fair enough, after <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hfmTkhbUHonV2gTlpn4lFYRkU7K2Oh7uf2i_oi1LMzA/edit">THIS</a> mission, I feel like they would keep an eye on the Second Rina.<br><br>&quot;<i>They are also charged with arresting and detaining agents who have (...) been marked as needing disciplinary action and have not yet been assigned any particular disciplinary route.</i>&quot;<br><br>Don&#39;t you feel like this is exactly what happened? Yes, in <i>Brink</i> the Aviator&#39;s crimes were listed but this may be the one mistake that caused this entrie issue to arrive. What if that &quot;Agent Dives, you are under arrest(...)&quot; part didn&#39;t exist? Don&#39;t you think it&#39;s be perfect plausible for them to detain the Aviator because of the &#39;disciplinary action&#39;? And why, you may ask? Well - here it is:<br><br>The issue about the Flowers - honestly, even now I have trouble with characterizing the Flowers, but can anyone really say they know exactly how a Flower is supposed to be portrayed? I don&#39;t think so.<br><br>You said the Flowers generally &quot;<i>don&#39;t indulge in a theatre of cruelty.</i>&quot; Fair point, but consider who is the Flower in charge of the DIA? Tiger Lily who, according to her wiki profile, doesn&#39;t tolerate insubordination and, in one of her creator&#39;s story, is said to enjoying being in charge. And it is just as you say - the Flowers don&#39;t understand humanity - Tiger Lily didn&#39;t understand Rina&#39;s regeneration, near-death experience and three (!) Legendary Badfics taken down in a really short amount of time. Add a Bleeprin deprivation and you&#39;ll get a mind more fragile than a soap bubble. The Flower just saw her as a rogue and ordered her incarceration to cement her authority in the Department. This, as hS pointed out, would be a great spark to a new arc in PPC history. A civil war, per se.<br><br>***<br><br>Now, my opinion on the interlude is irrelevant here, so I&#39;ll keep it to myself. The point is, while this was probably not Ixi&#39;s aim - she presented us with a hint that things in the PPC may not exactly be as pink and easy as we&#39;d like them to be. This is why I disagree with your view on the PPC but hey, you&#39;ve been here much longer than me, maybe you&#39;re right after all. I am not afraid to admit my mistakes, so let&#39;s see how things will evolve.<br></p>

            <p>I know you were responding to July, but I&#39;d like to respond to some of the points you made.<br><br><i>This is why the missions are spin-offs - different from the original and your vision of the PPC will always be different than, let&#39;s say, my vision of the PPC. Unless you&#39;re hoping to create some kind of position that will decide if the missions are kept in-check with one, decided version?</i><br><br>The problem with this point of view is that we are not discussing the tone of individual spin-offs, but the portrayal of shared elements in the PPC universe. Agents are as varied as the day is long, but those shared elements should be consistent and fit the PPC canon. Those are the parts that should be decided.<br><br><i>[…]can anyone really say they know exactly how a Flower is supposed to be portrayed? I don&#39;t think so.</i><br><br>Yes, someone can. That&#39;s because many of the Flowers have preexisting characterizations. We know how they speak and how they will react to different situations. Apart from those Flowers that have only been mentioned a few times, they are known entities. You can&#39;t pretend they&#39;re blank slates.<br><br><i>Fair point, but consider who is the Flower in charge of the DIA? Tiger Lily who, according to her wiki profile, doesn&#39;t tolerate insubordination and, in one of her creator&#39;s story, is said to enjoying being in charge.</i><br><br>&quot;Strict&quot; does not and should not immediately translate to &quot;cruel.&quot;<br><br><i>The Flower just saw her as a rogue and ordered her incarceration to cement her authority in the Department.</i><br><br>This makes no sense. Why would the Tiger Lily order an agent&#39;s arrest to solidify her own authority? She doesn&#39;t need to prove anything. The Flowers are pretty much unchecked in their own dominions. The Aviator wasn&#39;t trying to usurp the Tiger Lily.<br><br><i>This, as hS pointed out, would be a great spark to a new arc in PPC history. A civil war, per se.</i><br><br>A civil war. Really? Please tell me you are speaking in jest. That strikes me as an extremely bad idea outside of AUs.</p>

            <p>That&#39;s why details like it being noted FicPsych is watching Rina are important. This has all happened pretty quickly and they&#39;re not just kicking her around for sport or anything, they&#39;re trying to get the full story and make sure she&#39;s looked after too. At least, that&#39;s where I was going with things when doing various beta-y stuff/giving my input on how the DIA would probably operate. <br><br>Also, I do think it&#39;s perfectly fair for them to have told Rina exactly why she&#39;s being detained - unless people are objecting to the very concept of arrests being a thing, I suppose. The way I look at it is that she stole a PPC TARDIS (I do agree with hS on one thing - why do we even still have those?), went on a rampage in a canon universe doing the kinds of things agents kill Sues for, then after centuries of shenanigans crash landed in the Cafeteria atrium and nearly crushed several agents doing it. This is less stopping someone from trying to leave the PPC, and more taking exception to going AWOL and causing the exact kinds of problems the PPC tries to stop. Of course, things probably shouldn&#39;t&#39;ve shifted from &quot;are you okay? We&#39;re here to help!&quot; to &quot;YOU&#39;RE UNDER ARREST!&quot; within the space of two lines.</p>

            <p>RinAviator didn&#39;t go &quot;on a rampage in a canon universe doing the kinds of things agents kill Sues for&quot;, unless you count wandering aimlessly and keeping her head down as a charge. She didn&#39;t go running around getting up to insane stuff because she didn&#39;t want to draw attention to herself. A few small adventures at the very most, nothing even remotely major.</p>

            <p>At the time, I thought her various misadventures had been more, well, major. You commented on them thinking she was turning into a Sue because she was acting like someone out of a badfic and that didn&#39;t seem like something indicating a low profile being kept.

            <p>However, I think you did a good job of setting a true backstory for Rina, and if you study her story in depth, the glitter level drop fast, in my opinion to the least.<br><br>The scenes from her childhood are harsh, and she get real consequences for it, depression, self-harm and a Generic psychiatrist (Generic because if it was only the armchair, medications, no wonder she hate FicPsych).<br><br>Slay a Legendary, but with her rookie partner, a partner who &quot;died&quot; because of her (does Zeb know it, now ?), nevermind the ugly implications that Nuzlockers &quot;kill&quot; their other Pokemons this way... I need stop thinking about it<br><br>I read Tawaki&#39;s take about Time Lord transformation after Rose Potter, for the sake of comparison. Rina&#39;s transformation was not a plot device. It was special, but it was not free candy, It never was free candy.<br><br>Perfect memory + no Bleep + issues about herself (human life now impossible, being caught between being Time Lord and huùman, ...) + glitterbags trivializing her issues... no wonder they killed this one Sue before LMM.<br><br>Other Legendary is maximum squick, she&#39;s so broken that self-harming verges on suicide, the cocktail Bleep + Aspirin would not forgive.<br><br>She snaps, after her partner die for, and die because of her, for the second time. And it&#39;s only an first taste of her future with her family. Too much despair and pain, she flees this, for the simple reason she cannot handle it.<br><br>The time loop hold the very distinct probability of her death, she felt it weighting upon her long before she understood there was a time loop in the first place, and it&#39;s not something solved without pain (how many time she passed in this blender ?).<br><br>She&#39;s acting like a Time Lord now because, well, she&#39;s a Time Lord now. It&#39; was her only choice for keeping her sanity: she cannot be human anymore, and staying between the two lifes only lead to suffering. It&#39;s not an easy way, it&#39;s the only way.<br><br>Rina Dives/ the Aviator is not a Sue, she&#39;ll never be a Sue. She paid every single change who happened to her, nothing granted to her like free candy. Her problems are very real, and the way I&#39;m seeing things, centuries were needed for them. She&#39;s like Pyrrha Nikos for me, she sure looks like a Sue, but she has a real story, the changes who happened to her were well-written, the issues were made clear.<br><br>The Aviator is not Suvian in any sense of the term. It&#39;s only my opinion,but you handled her history in wonderful way, Iximaz (wow, didn&#39;t think it would take so much place).</p>

            <p>Considering they&#39;re responding to a possible threat in a PPC that has already seen multiple instances of being invaded or hit by canon nasties breaking in or what-have-you, a cautionary response with the hammer ready to be dropped seemed to make sense. This wasn&#39;t a DIS style &quot;we&#39;re going to drag you kicking and screaming into Central just to watch you bleed&quot; kind of thing and I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s all that ruthless considering one of the highest probability penalties is basically &quot;we&#39;ll be keeping an eye on you&quot;. When I gave the go ahead for stuff, I did it in the frame of mind that they&#39;re reacting to something they might or might not be very dangerous, so they&#39;re trying to protect the agents who all almost got a TARDIS crashed on top of them. Ruthless would be they kicked down the door and shot her in the face, not gone &quot;would you please come with us?&quot; Also, you bring up FicPsych, which was mentioned in the story. I personally feel your typical agent who pulls something like this is more likely to be kept in FicPsych than thrown in jail; most of the time when something like this happens, it&#39;s because somebody&#39;s snapped, not out of malice or anything, and especially considering Aviator&#39;s mental state that&#39;s what makes most sense. I did try to stress during betaing that that should be made more clear.<br><br>(It&#39;s probably not the best first impression of DIA Special Response, because that&#39;s them basically acting like a SWAT team, whereas most of the time they&#39;re bailing agents out of missions gone bad and stuff. Patrol officers are probably a little more easygoing than their SRD counterparts most of the time; SeaTurtle once asked me what kind of equipment the DIA likes to carry, and IIRC I said your typical Patrol guy probably likes something like a phaser or a stun blaster or a Potterverse wand that can immediately end a confrontation without anyone sustaining real injury. Though that said, sometimes a job calls for something heavier.)<br><br>I think that the possibility of actual trouble for things is not mutually exclusive with the kind of PPC thing you like - however, things evolving should be allowed to happen, and whether it&#39;s a good thing, well, that can always be story fodder rather than &quot;this should not exist at all.&quot; I could see arguments for and against, say, the PPC having its own police department. I could even see something like this being a debate being held in Central itself, which I might do something with (though since hS writes Dúros I couldn&#39;t feature the TL and both lieutenants talking about it without his okay/participation).<br><br>(I do agree the officer in that courtyard story was way out of line and I don&#39;t feel the DIA would ever consider that acceptable behaviour from one of its own, though. My comment on that is what got me brought in as a beta for this story.)<br><br>One possible solution, which I&#39;ll work on, is writing stuff showing that lighter side still exists, and it&#39;s not all grimness and people getting put in jail. The first DIA story I wrote, for example, had a bunch of officers on their off time having fun and talking about helping people - and Basil chewing a guy out for being too harsh and putting people at unacceptable risk. It&#39;s definitely something that could make for interesting writing if allowed to exist, and this debate - some people feeling it&#39;s all too much, others not, and all that - could be just as interesting in-universe as out of universe. Of course, in universe, at the end of the day if the DIA exists in its current form it&#39;s because the BoDH allows it, so they mustn&#39;t see it as that severe a problem - but again, this is something I plan to use as writing fodder.<br><br>(This actually gave me a specific idea, too. I could easily see some in Patrol seeing the Special Response boys as a little overeager to break out the toys and drop the hammer. The issue is definitely not as severe as some World One departments are accused of being -- no unarmed civilians are being gunned down in the middle of a corridor for example -- but it&#39;s definitely something I could work with if people allow. I might be half rambling and half brainstorming though, I&#39;m like half-asleep. I do sorta want to do a spinoff playing with both the absurdities and more serious aspects of &quot;protecting the Protectors&quot; and all that though; I&#39;m sure there&#39;s never a dull day with that job.)<br><br>Pardon the giant wall of text, but I&#39;m basically thinking aloud about multiple things.</p>

            <p>Ekyl, I have heard plenty about your behavior regarding your &quot;betaing&quot; of this story, and your treatment of its writers.<br><br>For the record? The stuff you were doing is bullying. <br><br>Your forced your own ideas onto the writers who weren&#39;t exactly eager about it. You overrode them multiple times on <i>their own story</i> to push your own concepts into the spotlight.<br><br>You have replied and defended the actions of the DIA as written in this more than anyone else involved with writing this, and have generally refused to accept that it a) isn&#39;t behavior associated with the DIA prior to you pushing for it and b) keep insisting this is largely totally fine while delfecting what was written onto Iximaz and co.<br><br>This is not okay.<br><br>You do not own the DIA. You did not come up with the concept. In your attempt to find something in the PPC to &quot;make your own&quot; you have worked very, very hard at warping something beyond recognition to the people who originally had an idea of what it was about. <br><br>I heavily suspect that at this point in time <i>I</i> have written more for the DIA proper than you, and that was one silly interlude to just introduce an idea into the PPC at large! You <i>cannot</i> and should not ride on the coattails of other boarders to make the things you want to have happen happen. <br><br>So please, knock this behavior off. You have been called out on it in the past, and I am extremely disappointed that you are pulling this sort of thing again. I honestly thought you had gotten better about it, but apparently it was just because I know how to tell you when to quit when I ask for your advice and you&#39;re willing to stop, but not when it comes to newer writers whom you are able to shove around more to make your ideas happen.<br><br>-July</p>

            <p>That said, I would rather have this conversation privately if it must happen -- in part, because I won&#39;t have my name dragged through the mud in front of the entire community, and in part because I&#39;m not sure how to address your concerns without sounding like I&#39;m deflecting blame and throwing people under the bus, which is not what I am attempting to do.<br><br>Quite honestly, the series of events as you portray them isn&#39;t exactly how things have gone down, although I will admit I&#39;ve been a bit gung ho about defending certain things when maybe that isn&#39;t really my place since all I am is the beta of the story (I wrote a tiny little bit, because I was asked to, but wasn&#39;t a real contributor to the story except as an editor). If I&#39;ve allowed my defensiveness over one aspect of the story to override Iximaz, I apologise for that but it wasn&#39;t intentional, and I&#39;ve hardly &quot;bullied&quot; anyone; in fact, one of the biggest changes I suggested to the story was overridden by the authors, and I didn&#39;t fight it (well, okay, I was a little resistant and made a comment along the lines of &quot;I wish you had kept me in the loop when you decided this,&quot; but I backed down rather than make it my hill to die on; at <i>worst</i>, I was a bit annoyed about it). I&#39;m not sure if you&#39;ve been given an incomplete idea of what&#39;s been going on, or a deliberately misleading one.<br><br>When I was brought in, it was to do a couple things: Ix wanted me to look over if her ideas for what the DIA would do fit my vision of how they&#39;re supposed to work (read: I tried to make them <i>not</i> seem super evil and authoritarian while still allowing the gist to be there - I still do not think it&#39;s an inherently bad thing that these days, sometimes people get arrested, but see other comments where I say in hindsight it does feel like it was a bit too abrupt and FicPsych being involved should&#39;ve been clearer/more prominent) and then to help sharpen up the story in general. The overall content of the story did not change from when I first started looking at it to when the story was published; the only new thing from wholecloth is the TARDIS crash scene, which I&#39;d initially suggested might make a stronger opening. Plotwise, and in terms of most of the dialogue and such, everything after Reader enters the TARDIS (except for the &quot;we&#39;re here and ready to help&quot; message from the DIA who think she&#39;s trapped in there) is more or less exactly how it was before, though some of the superficial details (it all happening outside the vehicle, etc) have changed. The scene ended up staying but the original intro was put back in; whether that works better is subjective, but I didn&#39;t want to fight it. For the most part, I suggested structural and stylistic changes, which ended up being made or not made, and did not mess with the overall plot of the story - everything that happened is what was happening when I was first called in (I think the biggest difference is the scene in Rudi&#39;s got rewritten entirely). To say I bullied my way in and forced the story to look how I wanted it to look is false - and again, I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s a misunderstanding, or people outright lying. Maybe it should have occurred to me to suggest some things, like the conversation between Guardsman and Terabyte, be trimmed out? Who knows, maybe it would have helped, but I did my best to help turn out a good story <i>without</i> taking things over; occasionally there were disagreements over suggested edits or a turn things were taking, or whether certain scenes should be present (I strongly felt the TARDIS scene at the start was just exposition and slowed things down, but backed down from that) but I in fact tried to do the exact opposite of what you accuse me of. When I&#39;m betaing somebody&#39;s story, I do my very best to be helpful and improve things as much as possible, and I am outright insulted that you would level these accusations at me - in fact, I consider them borderline libellous. Especially when you launch into some tirade about how the only reason I have changed is you &quot;told me to knock it off&quot; -- over the years I have tried very hard to become a better person, I have done a lot of growing up, and I acknowledge that&#39;s not really a journey that ever ends but I will not be told it was all <i>nothing</i> because of an argument on the damn internet. Even here, to say I have not changed is to be deliberately obtuse and to intentionally disregard years of behaviour that has changed for the better, and I will not be publicly insulted in such a manner. <br><br>As for the DIA: I have been defensive of them because I was called in to check over their MO and put in some of the groundwork for how they&#39;re operating, so of course I would defend the validity and existence of what&#39;s there. I&#39;ve tried to go to bat for Ix&#39;s story a bit, because she went into full &quot;I&#39;m sorry I&#39;ll leave forever&quot; mode. I apologise if I&#39;ve overstepped my bounds in so doing, however. All I&#39;ve been trying to say is that maybe it deserves to be given a chance, especially since it&#39;s not like I&#39;m not working on things that would paint a more reasonable picture of them, and I simply disagree that them being willing to arrest somebody means they&#39;re as evil and authoritarian and &quot;grimdark&quot; as you and hS maintain. You say I just arbitrarily went ahead and did things with no mind for people who &quot;know how it&#39;s supposed to work&quot; or whatever because I was so desperate to make my mark, but when I first came up with these ideas I only went ahead with anything with permission from and discussion with hS. I&#39;ll grant this was years ago and might have slipped from memory, but I remember you hearing about this so it feels to me as if you are being deliberately unfair. It is entirely possible, though, that it is simply fresher to my memory. Now, does what&#39;s being written wholly match up with how I&#39;ve envisioned things? No. There have been in fact several things I disagree with of late, though I evidently didn&#39;t catch all of them. However, I still feel the need to call for things to at least be given a chance. If I&#39;m a little protective of the DIA, I apologise, but I don&#39;t like something I&#39;ve worked on being discarded as rubbish that shouldn&#39;t exist any more than I like the language you employ towards my own person, which makes me out to be some tumourous influence, especially when I have tried to take great care over the years to prevent a situation exactly like this (this is, in fact, why nothing is finished), and have been working on projects I hope will present a more reasonable view of the department. I will also note you ascribe more control over the process to me than there actually was - you act as if I wrote major sections of this story wholecloth, as opposed to basically answering the question &quot;does this make sense y/n&quot;.<br><br>I am sorry if I come off as excessively angry, but let&#39;s not mince words: right now I am trying my best not to be, but I am incredibly hurt that you would say these things to me. You have made some good points but you&#39;ve also stepped over practically every line on the bloody road, and I apologise for how I might have come off, but I will not be treated this way, by you or anyone else here. I expect a full apology from you for insulting me so severely, and so publicly. I am especially hurt, because I thought you and I were mending things - but I see you hold the same contempt for me as ever. I&#39;m not angry with you, July, I&#39;m just very, <i>very</i> disappointed.</p>

Then the several people who have told me the same thing at separate occasions must have been exaggerating the exact same way? <br><br>&quot;although I will admit I&#39;ve been a bit gung ho about defending certain things when maybe that isn&#39;t really my place since all I am is the beta of the story (I wrote a tiny little bit, because I was asked to, but wasn&#39;t a real contributor to the story except as an editor).&quot;<br><br>While ignoring everything else that is not DIA related about the criticisms yes. <br><br>&quot;If I&#39;ve allowed my defensiveness over one aspect of the story to override Iximaz, I apologise for that but it wasn&#39;t intentional, and I&#39;ve hardly &quot;bullied&quot; anyone; in fact, one of the biggest changes I suggested to the story was overridden by the authors, and I didn&#39;t fight it (well, okay, I was a little resistant and made a comment along the lines of &quot;I wish you had kept me in the loop when you decided this,&quot; but I backed down rather than make it my hill to die on; at <i>worst</i>, I was a bit annoyed about it). I&#39;m not sure if you&#39;ve been given an incomplete idea of what&#39;s been going on, or a deliberately misleading one.&quot;<br><br>So you had not disappeared on at least one occasion causing me to field at least two freakouts about what should they do, they told Ekyl something he disagreed with and when they said they wanted to keep it you made a comment about their attitudes and vanished without telling them anything? <br><br>&quot;When I was brought in, it was to do a couple things: Ix wanted me to look over if her ideas for what the DIA would do fit my vision of how they&#39;re supposed to work (read: I tried to make them not seem super evil and authoritarian while still allowing the gist to be there - I still do not think it&#39;s an inherently bad thing that these days, sometimes people get arrested, but see other comments where I say in hindsight it does feel like it was a bit too abrupt and FicPsych being involved should&#39;ve been clearer/more prominent) and then to help sharpen up the story in general.&quot;<br><br>I was under the impression she asked for help to make it match the PPC, given you are supposed to know the universe and made commentary previous. I think the resident Elf Lord was involved too as far as advice seeking went? I do not know. It is late and I just accidentally titled Huinesoron.  Dangerous hour, midnight.<br><br>And... the gist being... super evil and authoritarian? I do not understand. Evil is an inherently bad thing, and so is authoritarianism in nearly every case outside of a few. <br><br>&quot;The overall content of the story did not change from when I first started looking at it to when the story was published; the only new thing from wholecloth is the TARDIS crash scene, which I&#39;d initially suggested might make a stronger opening. Plotwise, and in terms of most of the dialogue and such, everything after Reader enters the TARDIS (except for the &quot;we&#39;re here and ready to help&quot; message from the DIA who think she&#39;s trapped in there) is more or less exactly how it was before, though some of the superficial details (it all happening outside the vehicle, etc) have changed.&quot;<br><br>I&#39;ve seen the first few drafts at this point in time. I cannot comment on where in the timeline you got involved. I am sure if we asked to see it it would reveal some interesting differences, no?<br><br>&quot;The scene ended up staying but the original intro was put back in; whether that works better is subjective, but I didn&#39;t want to fight it.&quot;<br><br>Except as I am aware, you had? <br><br>&quot;For the most part, I suggested structural and stylistic changes, which ended up being made or not made, and did not mess with the overall plot of the story - everything that happened is what was happening when I was first called in (I think the biggest difference is the scene in Rudi&#39;s got rewritten entirely).&quot;<br><br>I cannot comment on this, besides that again, I heard much in the ways of the writers being frustrated and worried about some of the things you were insisting on despite their lack of surety, and their being put down when suggested changes by you were turned down, or they suggested doing something you were against. <br><br>&quot;To say I bullied my way in and forced the story to look how I wanted it to look is false - and again, I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s a misunderstanding, or people outright lying.&quot;<br><br>I do not understand; are you saying your word is stronger than that of several different people, whom had no reason to bad mouth you, looked up to you, and had asked you for your advice because they were under the impression you would help them?  None of them had any reason to lie to me. Again none of them knew they were speaking to me separately. It&#39;s awfully strange to think they would have the same delusion, don&#39;t you think?<br><br>&quot;Maybe it should have occurred to me to suggest some things, like the conversation between Guardsman and Terabyte, be trimmed out? Who knows, maybe it would have helped, but I did my best to help turn out a good story <i>without</i> taking things over; occasionally there were disagreements over suggested edits or a turn things were taking, or whether certain scenes should be present (I strongly felt the TARDIS scene at the start was just exposition and slowed things down, but backed down from that) but I in fact tried to do the exact opposite of what you accuse me of.&quot;<br><br>The writers are always the final word. Not the beta reader. <br><br>&quot;When I&#39;m betaing somebody&#39;s story, I do my very best to be helpful and improve things as much as possible, and I am outright insulted that you would level these accusations at me - in fact, I consider them borderline libellous.&quot;<br><br>I&#39;m surprised! I wasn&#39;t aware anything I said was libel, given what I have presented thus far! I apologize for the requiring such accusations. <br><br>&quot;Especially when you launch into some tirade about how the only reason I have changed is you &quot;told me to knock it off&quot; -- over the years I have tried very hard to become a better person, I have done a lot of growing up, and I acknowledge that&#39;s not really a journey that ever ends but I will not be told it was all <i>nothing</i> because of an argument on the damn internet.&quot;<br><br>Didn&#39;t say that. The context for me telling you to knock it off was entirely in the scope of your suggestions to me for my own work in progress! As you should know I do not share things randomly. I asked you because I valued your advice in that situation! Alas that you think I was implying I was the source of all your growth and had work at becoming a better person! I would never dream of such. I had asked because I thought you had grown as a person! <br><br> &quot;Even here, to say I have not changed is to be deliberately obtuse and to intentionally disregard years of behaviour that has changed for the better, and I will not be publicly insulted in such a manner.&quot;<br><br>Ok. But I&#39;m not. That is why I was entirely shocked to find all this out. <br><br>&quot;As for the DIA: I have been defensive of them because I was called in to check over their MO and put in some of the groundwork for how they&#39;re operating, so of course I would defend the validity and existence of what&#39;s there.&quot;<br><br>Yes, this is what you have done. But I thought you were invited in to, again, make sure it matched for the PPC tone. <br><br>&quot;I&#39;ve tried to go to bat for Ix&#39;s story a bit, because she went into full &quot;I&#39;m sorry I&#39;ll leave forever&quot; mode. I apologise if I&#39;ve overstepped my bounds in so doing, however. All I&#39;ve been trying to say is that maybe it deserves to be given a chance, especially since it&#39;s not like I&#39;m not working on things that would paint a more reasonable picture of them, and I simply disagree that them being willing to arrest somebody means they&#39;re as evil and authoritarian and &quot;grimdark&quot; as you and hS maintain.&quot;<br><br>You did? By and large you have been defending the DIA elements only.  Also, a correction.  Neither of us have used the words evil, authoritarian, or grimdark. The closest to even using the word &quot;grimdark&quot; was PoorCynic! And he wasn&#39;t even talking about the DIA there. Only mopey angsty Time Lords. <br><br>&quot;You say I just arbitrarily went ahead and did things with no mind for people who &quot;know it&#39;s supposed to work&quot; or whatever because I was so desperate to make my mark, but when I first came up with these ideas I only went ahead with anything with permission from and discussion with hS.&quot;<br><br>Well, not arbitrarily at all. And I think the point is that no, they didn&#39;t. Which is why they asked you. And I can&#39;t speak for hS, as I am not Elven and have no mind powers whatsoever, but I believe his lordship&#39;s view of the DIA aligned with that of its creator, Artemis, who was all about scooping the flamethrower agents up and depositing them into the Kudzu&#39;s caring, alarmingly enveloping tendrils. Mine too, but I don&#39;t actually go there. Oh wait, I have a DIA agent too. I guess I am accidentally invested in only goose stepping at work? Wait, I&#39;m in the navy, I can&#39;t march for the life of me. That&#39;s everyone else.<br><br>&quot;I&#39;ll grant this was years ago and might have slipped from memory, but I remember you hearing about this so it feels to me as if you are being deliberately unfair. It is entirely possible, though, that it is simply fresher to my memory. Now, does what&#39;s being written wholly match up with how I&#39;ve envisioned things? No. There have been in fact several things I disagree with of late, though I evidently didn&#39;t catch all of them.&quot;<br><br>It is late at night and I would enjoy clarification? How am I being deliberately unfair? What is this about years ago? I do not understand and this is vague enough that the many third parties reading this are no doubt confused as well about what you are implying. <br><br>&quot;However, I still feel the need to call for things to at least be given a chance. If I&#39;m a little protective of the DIA, I apologise, but I don&#39;t like something I&#39;ve worked on being discarded as rubbish that shouldn&#39;t exist any more than I like the language you employ towards my own person, which makes me out to be some tumourous influence, especially when I have tried to take great care over the years to prevent a situation exactly like this (this is, in fact, why nothing is finished), and have been working on projects I hope will present a more reasonable view of the department.&quot;<br><br>I never called it rubbish. I am interested in hearing where you are pulling this from. Nor was my language particularly harsh towards you in the first place. I am quite surprised. <br><br>I don&#39;t think &quot;tumor&quot; is the correct word here. Not that negative, certainly.<br><br>It would certainly be a step up if you had DIA works to show proof of purchase with, so to say. I think.<br><br>&quot;I will also note you ascribe more control over the process to me than there actually was - you act as if I wrote major sections of this story wholecloth, as opposed to basically answering the question &quot;does this make sense y/n&quot;.&quot;<br><br>I did not? Unless you are some powerful slightly terrifying puppet master. All I can go off is that several younger and more easily influenced PPCers looked up to you, decided to ask your aid, and then were given an extremely hard time from the sound of it.<br><br>I seem to recollect at least one incident where you told them their deadline didn&#39;t matter, what mattered was that you felt it was finished? Strange thing for the beta to say, I think, when it should be the author calling that shot.<br><br><br>&quot;I am sorry if I come off as excessively angry, but let&#39;s not mince words: right now I am trying my best not to be, but I am incredibly hurt that you would say these things to me.&quot;<br><br>Ok. I&#39;m feeling rather hurt too. I wasn&#39;t expecting to be accused of so many things or to see people I have been keeping an eye on be accused of so many things, which largely seem to involve conspiring against your good name with lots of uncoordinated lying. <br><br>&quot;You have made some good points but you&#39;ve also stepped over practically every line on the bloody road, and I apologise for how I might have come off, but I will not be treated this way, by you or anyone else here.&quot;<br><br>Out of curiosity where exactly are these lines? Do they involve the ones where you repeatedly put words in my mouth here and elsewhere? Since I had called you out on that previously already. <br><br>“I expect a full apology from you for insulting me so severely, and so publicly.&quot;<br><br>I am very very sorry that I insulted you severely to the point where you felt the need to make baseless accusations against others to right the perceived wrongs against you. Next time I will try to avoid inducing collateral damage, because it is never fun to calm down crying girls at odd hours of the day and sometimes night. It&#39;s quite awkward, you see, when I had told them previously I had used you myself for assistance. <br><br>“I am especially hurt, because I thought you and I were mending things - but I see you hold the same contempt for me as ever. I&#39;m not angry with you, July, I&#39;m just very, <i>very</i> disappointed.”<br><br>I was under the impression we were as well! Does this mean you are no longer willing to provide additional advice and counsel on the story I am planning to work on? My apologies. I suppose I will have to look elsewhere for more suggestions to not make the DIA irrelevant to the PPC in the course of the story. This will be somewhat difficult, because His Elflordliness Huinesoron is very easily distracted and very bad at replying to email in a timely fashion. <br><br>Thank you very much for taking the time to reply to me as thoroughly as you did, however. I greatly appreciate it, seeing how I know how busy we all are these days. <br></p>

            <p>The only time I said anything about leaving the project was at the very end - I told you I was in a bad place with my real life and could no longer give the story my full attention, and was thus stepping down. I even apologised to you about it. This had been going on the whole time I was working with you, in fact, but I did my best to put as much of my energy into the story as I could; it just so happened I could no longer do it, and that had nothing to do with you or the story itself. I simply no longer felt I could continue, and that to try would just be wasting your time. There were about four people betaing this story, and so I figured one of them stepping down would not harm anything at that late point in the work.<br><br>Should I have stepped down sooner? Maybe, but I wanted to do the best I could for you and the story. Since, according to Scape, I was neither needed nor <i>wanted</i>, I would have appreciated you sparing my time and energy, especially when you proceeded to lie to my face while making me out to be the devil himself behind my back. If you had these concerns, I was available to talk to about them whenever you so desired. You could have said something; as an editor, once I&#39;m on a roll it&#39;s hard to stop me, which seems to be what&#39;s happened, but you could have resolved the whole thing by talking to me about it honestly. I thought we were even developing a rapport, and I would have been happy to talk to you about your concerns, but apparently I was mistaken. <br><br>As I said to Scape, since this is how you feel, and you think so lowly of me, feel free to take my name off this story and remove anything I contributed to it. Apparently I added nothing of value anyway.<br><br>(An aside: Something like what you say might have occurred when there was that brief dustup about the intro? I honestly don&#39;t remember. What I do remember is it was a heat of the moment thing and everything was resolved quickly and amicably. I do remember saying you&#39;d been dishonest, but that was because you said outright you only pretended to like what I suggested to avoid having to talk about it - I do indeed consider that dishonesty, and I stand behind feeling that being unwilling to discuss things honestly with one&#39;s beta reader makes the entire process pointless. Both author and editor are wasting their time in such a scenario.)</p>

            <p>Throughout this entire thing, I&#39;ve been on the sidelines. I&#39;ve been a beta on Brink for nearly every version, and I have seen so many changes to the story within these long eight months. For a while, one version was very close to completion; this was about a month ago, around the time that LMM and the stuff after it occurred. After all of the issues surrounding the DIA and the dark nature of it in general, everything changed once again. In order to avoid another situation, the entire story (and almost everything that came after!) had to be changed. So the team decided to bring in someone with more experience in the DIA, AKA you. <br><br>I hadn&#39;t taken a look at the doc much during this time - it had been a week or two without any changes. It was very nearly done, and superb in quality. Emotion was there, characterization was there, you could feel how each style blended as each author contributed their heart and soul into writing Brink. It was good. The only thing that needed some more polishing was the DIA section, which was why you were invited.<br><br>That is not what you limited yourself to.<br><br>Essentially, you &quot;suggested&quot; a lot of things in a highly passive-aggressive way that changed the entire dynamic of the story. Both the opening and the endings received heavy changes, some very touching scenes and interactions were removed (in particular, the Guardsman giving peace to the fallen Time Lords as brothers and sisters-in-arms), and a lot of the suggestions you made for &quot;polishing&quot; reasons straight-up took that unique style out of the story. For lack of a better term, it was sterilized. Too precise. And both Desdendelle and I said as much after all of that. I was up for quite a while some nights talking to Ixi because she needed to vent her frustrations with you, and that&#39;s why I was present for a lot of the final editing sessions; as support and an extra voice so she would feel able to stand up to you. Whether or not you see it, you WERE being forceful with your suggestions. That biggest change you mentioned earlier was reimplementing the entire opening, which you insisted on cutting; when the authors came to a consensus to add it back in, you did not say something along the lines of &quot;I wish you had kept me in the loop&quot;, your exact words were &quot;It&#39;s much weaker with this in. Even (Iximaz) agreed when we made the change, so what changed your mind?&quot; After it was explained that this was due to comments from three other betas (including me) who liked the first version better, and Ix specifically stated that she wasn&#39;t actually in agreement, she just didn&#39;t want to say no, you then said &quot;...that makes the whole process pointless. If you don&#39;t like my suggestions, don&#39;t lie to me about it.&quot;<br><br>I can easily name about 20 occasions before then that she had shied away from disagreeing. And that&#39;s just her, I can&#39;t speak for the other contributors.<br><br>Please do not take this as a personal attack. That is not my intention. But you DID change the story heavily, with quite a few choice words if things were changed back; never fully aggressive, but passive. Whether you see it or not, I did, and I am only saying this as an observer who has been watching this whole thing and listening to his friend when she needed someone to talk to because she was frustrated. She has shown immense self-control in dealing with you. I tend to be very internet-shy. I don&#39;t post often. But I am speaking up now because this matters to me.</p>

            <p>And yes, I was rather angry about being left out of the loop. You&#39;ll remember that was resolved rather quickly though - I was hurt by Ix thinking I didn&#39;t deserve to be told &quot;I disagree&quot; to my face. That&#39;s what offended me, not people wanting to go back to the previous version, and I remember you being present for me telling people that much.</p>

            <p>You weren&#39;t invited to comment on anything other than the DIA sections, and you promptly demanded whole sections to be changed that were not even remotely within your purview. You made niggly little stylistic changes and threw tantrums when the author, whose style is both different to and a damned sight more interesting than yours by some distance, changed them back. I recall similar behaviour when you betaed my first mission, which is getting on for two years ago now, and my memory is atrocious so there must have been something going on.<br><br>Simply put, you shoved yourself into places where your advice was neither required nor wanted and demanded that the story follow your vision rather than that of the person actually writing it. You can bet your life I&#39;m never going to let you near anything else of mine, and I hope any newer people reading this learn better than to have you as a beta without adult supervision.</p>

            <p>I have tried writing this post about 5 times now. But every time, it did not accurately portray my thoughts. Your behavior has gotten me riled up enough that I am quite literally at a loss for words. I don&#39;t know what to say anymore. But I will try anyway.<br><br>With this post, you are being quite hypocritical. You state that you&#39;re being made out to be a &quot;monster&quot;, and yet you&#39;re trying to do the exact same thing by essentially stating that it&#39;s everyone else&#39;s fault for not calling you out sooner. That everyone is out to get you, that it&#39;s their fault it came to all of this. By implying that others are trying to demonize you, you are attempting to take the moral high ground. You&#39;re hiding your jabs behind a mask of civility. So here is what I have to say: you&#39;re still not aware of the problem, despite being told multiple times. This is not on them. You&#39;re ignoring your own words and behavior, and shifting the blame. </p>

            <p>You&#39;ve gone from defending Iximaz to claiming she hates you and wants to make you look bad in front of the whole PPC (something you&#39;re more than capable of doing on your own, I might add). I was wondering about that, and then I remembered who was doing all this and stopped wondering.<br><br>It was never about Brink. It was never about defending Iximaz. It was about <i>you</i>.

            <p>Brink&#39;s primary influence, from my perspective at least, was the Third Doctor&#39;s incarceration on Earth. Maybe it&#39;s just because I&#39;ve been working with Ix for a while, but it felt like the kind of thing that fitted. As for why she is being treated harshly, well, it wouldn&#39;t surprise me in the least if the Guardsman had pushed for it a little. We&#39;ve seen in a few bits and pieces that he&#39;s feeling betrayed by the Aviator, has taken the Reader under his wing instead, and is sufficiently governed by his emotions to blow up upon losing a screwdriver - forgive my not providing chapter and verse, I&#39;m on my phone and formatting is a royal pain - so I think he&#39;d want to throw the proverbial book at her and could maybe get some stuff to stick. But hey, I&#39;m just some boring little Marx-botherer, you don&#39;t have to pay it any mind.</p>

            <p>That is nice to know, but my concern wasn&#39;t with regards to inspiration.

            <p>Not entering this discussion, just want to clarify one thing--the Reader&#39;s been under the Guardsman&#39;s wing for quite a while. She has in no way replaced Rina there; they&#39;ve grown close in their own right, and it happened...oh, actually around the same time or a little after Rina and the Guardsman started to get close. Remember the TARDIS repair session (&quot;Cale Seche&quot;)? This next bit isn&#39;t out yet, though it was referenced here--the Reader&#39;s been taking lessons from the Guardsman, spending a fair bit of time with him. They&#39;ve become good friends. While Rina is (was) certainly a mutual friend of theirs, and they were both close to her, the Reader grew close to the Guardsman around the same time and in a different way--less a father-daughter thing and more an equals thing. So he hasn&#39;t taken the Reader under his wing instead of Rina--they were both already there, in different ways.<br><br>(That <i>is</i> a pretty interesting theory, though. The question then, of course, would be: why were the recommendations of one agent--one very close to the matter, at that--accepted and pushed through and all? How would the Guardsman have gotten such pull that something like this could work? And why did no one oppose him, or say &#39;nah, that&#39;s too much work, we have better things to do, and the Flowers don&#39;t care enough to get so detailed about it anyway&#39; (or something along those lines)?<br><br>This is meant entirely as theoretical speculation, mind you. It is in <i>no way</i> Word of Co-Author that that&#39;s what happened; just got curious about following that idea.)<br><br>~DF</p>

            <p>I&#39;m not really sure I see the Flowers going off the recommendation of one random dude, but maybe because he knows her they&#39;d take something into consideration.

She&#39;s been a Time Lord for four hundred and thirty-five years; that&#39;s about twenty-four times as long as she lived as a human. There&#39;s very little of what she used to be left; forcing her back into human form would break her.</p>

            <p>Specifically, that link is giving a 404 error. From what you wrote I was assuming that &#39;The Eight Gates&#39; could be found at that link, and the &#39;Ashes to Glory&#39; would be available soon. Did I misunderstand that?

            <p>Why, yes! hS has done a comic called Generic Surface, which is probably linked through the wiki (try Agent Louise&#39;s page) and is certainly linked through his webplex. There&#39;s even a PPC game, which I&#39;m pretty sure can also be found on his website. Come to think of it, he&#39;s even made a video or two as Agent Dafydd--funny, that, he&#39;s rather done everything, hasn&#39;t he? :)<br><br>Apart from hS, I&#39;m not sure, though I expect some other things exist. There&#39;s certainly a lot of fanart, and even the Playscriptes, which have been recorded. Not to mention the Multiverse Monitor...<br><br>In short: we are indeed a multi-media community! :D<br><br>~DF</p>

            <p>Hm. Well, I know there&#39;s been discussion about it, but I think it&#39;s generally been left along because you&#39;d have to draw the comic reactions or video the video...or else insert bits of the fancomics/vids somehow and get really creative with the mission structure. Or else just describe the comic or vid really well, which sounds annoying and rather boring; I&#39;ve also seen sporkings on other comms of fancomics that used...must&#39;ve been screenshots, or something, and then prose reacting to it. Not sure if any PPC missions exist to them, though.<br><br>I&#39;ve certainly been thinking for quite a while of missioning a Quotev quiz, though. Just haven&#39;t found one bad enough. I&#39;m...not entirely sure how I was thinking of going about it, unfortunately, but I know it involved an agent taking the quiz and pointing out what was wrong...s&#39;pose they could whack the screen afterwards? Or be on-scene and selecting options that are hanging in the air in front of them? It could work.<br><br>~DF</p>

            <p>I think maybe, at some point, someone might have.

It&#39;s more of a different perspective on the PPC-versus-Sue situation; after all, Sues are living creatures in their own, odd, eldritch-abomination way.</p>

            <p>I know that the PPC is about as unprofessional as a paramilitary organization can get, but I&#39;ve decided that I will use security badges for my agents once I get permission. The thing is, I want to have them ready before I ask for permission. As such, I have no idea how to fill them out.<br><br>As in, what information should be displayed? I&#39;d guess that an RC number, name, and department/division should be on there, but what else? A normal answer would be fine, but if someone were to make a chart (Different departments would probably have different information), I could have an even easier time doing this, for both myself and other people. Which reminds me, once I master doing this, I will be open to making badges for others.<br><br>And, lastly, I may or may not have asked this before. I&#39;m one of those people who doesn&#39;t have any memory of what they post. So, uh, sorry if I have, in fact, asked before and forgotten.</p>

            <p>I could see this sort of thing being used. Although depending on the level of information you want to include, some kind of ID card (like a driving license or passport style of thing) might be better. <br><br>As has already been pointed out, agents already wear flashpatches that identify their department (and there is the recent idea of <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Mission_Pin">pins</a> to indicate temporary assignments with different departments), so I&#39;m not sure that a badge with just basic name/department info on it would serve much purpose, but a more detailed card might be useful(I&#39;m assuming that Personnel have detailed files for each agent, and that this card would just be a brief summary). <br><br>Details that I can see being on this would be:<br>* Full name<br>* Maybe a photo if it&#39;s to be used for actual ID purposes (after all, you&#39;ve got be able to prove to the HQ bartenders that you&#39;re old enough to drink somehow)<br>* Maybe some kind of unique ID number - agents could change their name, and Personnel having some kind of number for looking up a specific individual would probably make their paperwork easier to keep track of<br>* Age (see previous comment concerning bartenders)<br>* Species (might not always be obvious, particularly with human-looking aliens) <br>* Department<br>* Division<br>* Indication of experience (I know we don&#39;t have ranks like in the military, but some distinction between Newbie, Agent and Veteran Agent could be possible)<br>* Any special permissions/notes (such as licensed Sun Crusher pilot, completed lightsaber safety training course, etc.)<br>* Any special restrictions<br><br>- Irish</p>

            <p>An old, old precedent it is, too. I think the only remaining (or just only?) example is Talia Nightsong&#39;s ID, which you can find on <a href="http://agent-talia.livejournal.com/profile">her LJ profile</a>. Just scroll down a bit, it&#39;s got a front and back.<br><br>It seems to cover most of your data, Irish, with the addition of organ donor status and minis; and maybe the Psych Eval number stands in for experience and special notes?

            <p>How do you guys like this new back, with the magnetic strip and QV code?

I changed &quot;Other&quot; to &quot;Special Status&quot; after I did Nume&#39;s, and I don&#39;t really think transfer history or OFU-graduate status warrant special note. I also put Floaters first for Kaitlyn&#39;s ID, since I perceive Floaters to be her primary assignment these days (and I know she&#39;s not happy about it). I also mucked about with the color balance of her picture a fair bit, since the original is really dark and muddy. It was <i>just</i> big enough to work, though!<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I approve of all the changes (though I think Selene just arbitrarily decided at some point to be 250 until further notice). Kaitlyn won&#39;t be happy about the department order, but that&#39;s officeocracy for you.<br><br>I particularly approve of Selene&#39;s writing - that&#39;s pretty much perfect.

            <p>That looks kinda familiar - I think I probably came across it on Talis&#39; wiki page (which just shows the front). <br><br>I would think that most agents <i>should</i> have a psych eval on file - given the known dangers of field work, I would think that agents would be required to have a little chat with one of the FicPsych nurses before being cleared for field duty. Not sure if they&#39;d bother with that for non-field staff, like the guys in Building Maintenance or the Intel sorters, but for everyone else it just seems like a sensible precaution. <br><br>- Irish</p>

            <p>What is considered &#39;drinking age&#39;, exactly? It varies wildly enough in World One, never mind a multiuniversal extradimensional location such as HQ, where you get continua where the legal adult age is ten and another has theirs at a hundred and ten.</p>

            <p>Although not in too much detail. <br><br>Even if we go with 21 as being a typical-high value for World One, what does that mean for people like elves? 21 is basically a toddler for them, isn&#39;t it? <br><br>Honestly, bartenders in HQ probably have one of the hardest jobs of all: never mind taking on Sue, just trying to figure out if they&#39;re supposed to be serving people or not could drive them insane! <br><br>Thinking about it, the only two ways I can see that would make sense are:<br>1) There is no minimum age, and all agents are expected to be sensible enough to determine at what age they individually should be able to drink alcohol. <br>2) Behind each bar is a huge cross-reference chart consisting of species and canon or origin (sub-divided by location in the case of those canons that are detailed enough to have multiple areas of jurisdiction with different ages), which gives the appropriate in-universe drinking age. <br><br>Or the meta explanation: if you think your agent should be able to get served, then they can get served. I&#39;m guessing that, for human agents at least, most people will assume that the drinking age will match that the one for where they live - so for me, that&#39;s 18 (or 16 if you&#39;re ordering it with food and with a responsible adult). <br><br>- Irish</p>

            <p>And, besides, even if the PPC doesn&#39;t really use security badges, that doesn&#39;t mean they don&#39;t have them. Corporate security guards have their logos ironed on to their uniforms, if they even have them, but they also have badges. I would find it extremely bizarre if the PPC has no automated security measures whatsoever-especially considering how easy it would be to get lost and wander into a potentially restricted section. All Sun Crusher pilots need a license to fly the Sun Crushers. Just watch Voyager, and count how many times a shuttle is stolen. It&#39;s about once an episode. Now, imagine that instead of Voyager and shuttles, it&#39;s an insane agent and a Sun Crusher.<br><br>Congrats, DOGA, you just vaporized Middle Earth because you were too cheap to put security scanners on your stuff. Simply, put, HQ has some of the most dangerous things in existence, and only having them protected by agents who are trained to recognize people is a recipe for disaster that outstrips anything ever seen before.</p>

            <p>Flash patches do seem to have some sort of <strike>magical</strike> sufficiently advanced technological power, though; for one thing, they generate the Someone Else&#39;s Problem field that helps cloak agents in canon.  I think it was also mentioned in a spin-off that they contain something that stops agents from being reassembled into their home continuum?  So I suppose you could also assume that they work as a sort of security badge.</p>

            <p>Oh well, here I come ...<br><br>I am a french student who discovered PPC this summer, thanks to TV Tropes (heavens to murgatroyd, what a complete and utter surprise) and The Original Series, who were some great fun and have been lurking around all summer.<br><br>My fandoms include the work of the Eddings, Jim Butcher, Mistborn of Brandon Sanderson, the Wheel of Time, RWBY, Order of the Stick, the Persona series, Fire Emblem, and different sections of the MegaTen verse, Devil Survivor, for example. I alllso began Doctor Who New Series, and The Lord of the Rings, bookverse, though I already read the Silmarillion. I like tabletop RPGs and STRs too.<br><br>My favorite author here is Iximaz and my favorite agent the Aviator, her spinoff was the first I read in its entirety, and I found it awesome.<br><br>Nice to meet you, this community seems really nice, and I hope I will stick around for a long time.<br><br>And before leaving, here is an [<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNtcP6EXm3s"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNtcP6EXm3s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNtcP6EXm3s</a></a> opening music] for a newbie. (RWBY openings are so great, and they feel perfect for PPC in my opinion).<br><br>P.S. : Be merciless for SpaG, I fluently read English, but I didn&#39;t write with it for a long time, and I intend to get Permission a day or another, the glitterbags from Personaverse and Dresdenverse will not kill themselves (though with Sues, you never know ...).</p>

            <p>I hope it doesn&#39;t matter if I&#39;m posting some of the badfics I found here, right ?<br><br>I already pointed some badfics here, so here I come with three new monsters to take down. I&#39;m warning you against Dresden Files spoilers here, up to Skin Game. If you think these fics aren&#39;t so bad, don&#39;t hesitate and say it. I want to be sure I can spot badfic.<br><br>So, let&#39;s begin :<br><br>- <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9902363/1/The-Memories-Left-in-the-Fog"> The Memories Left in the Fog</a>, a Persona 4 fic with an amnesic FeMC who live in Dojima Residence, a &quot;very special guest&quot; according to Igor, with a unstable Velvet Room (cannon is defending itself, I&#39;m sure of it), really urple passages, and a protagonist using Fool Izanami, but not the Wild Card. Sweet Philemon.<br><br>- <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8588271/1/Hell-s-Bells-Potter"> Hell&#39;s Bells Potter</a>, a &quot;master of death&quot;, post DH Harry get transported to the Dresdenverse while he&#39;s searching Merlin&#39;s cloak in Burkina Faso. In the Chicago Museum. During Dead Beat. His first action is stealing Butters&#39; moment of awesome against Cassius, the one foreshadowing his role as a Knight of the Cross, and his role as Sue&#39;s drummer. It. Cannot. Be. Right.<br><br>- <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11352036/1/ReVamp"> ReVamp</a>. This is the main course. I&#39;ll be honest, I only began the first chapter, did some scrolling before posting it, but it was necessary. The three chapters are actually three rewritings of the Dresden Files with a WCV!Harry.<br><br>First problem, it begins with Blood Rites, leaving the first books rotting in some sort of beige transition. No consequences for this thing&#39;s nature, it&#39;s still in the White Council, and he passed through Summer Knight alive, altough Elaine was his first kill (the only thing I found logic here, since they were... close during their apprenticeship), and other shenanigans like this.<br>The other chapters are about Dead Beat and Proven Guilty.<br><br>Second problem, the author continues the canon slaughtering by revealing McCoy as Not!Harry&#39;s grandfather, who let him walk around with Bob, AND it introduce Maggie in the first Maggie. Harry&#39;s daughter, six books before Changes.<br><br>This vampire need to die now, and I recommend dropping this Stu in the Deeps, during White Night, so the uber-ghouls take care of him.<br>The author got others stories, and I&#39;m betting my left arm that some of them will be missionable too, judging by this one.</p>

The canon breaking parts were as you said and as for the urple prose passages, well nothing could show them better than the fic itself, so for the interest of other Boarders, here are some glaring examples: <br><br>&quot;The sky rippled a beautiful red and black, but it wasn&#39;t reachable. It was the only thing the fog couldn&#39;t touch- and naturally, if it couldn&#39;t reach it, then I certainly couldn&#39;t. The fog was ubiquitous. It was my reality to wander the infinite fogbank.<br><br>The world was sky and fog and shadows; eternal and immutable. Against infinity, a moment is useless. That was why I didn&#39;t keep memories. This was a world where nothing worth preserving happened; there was no growth, no change. Stagnation defined this worthless realm, an eternity of perpetual peace drowned in the fog.&quot;<br><br>&quot;...Human faces that stared out of the inky shadows of the world.<br><br>I heard a cry of grief; a wailing dirge from the uncountable to a single extinguished life that pieced my chest with empathetic heat. I was being ripped apart, parts of me that I never knew existed pulled in opposite extremes-&quot; <br><br>&quot;This place was at peace, I realized. That was why it was so terrifying. This was a place that had decided entirely what it was to be for all eternity, and would resist all change to that end. Time would not flow here. The fog would not lift. <br><br>It was the most permanent sort of mask. A seal never to be broken.&quot; <br><br>I rest my case.</p>

            <p>Another fellow Boarder who got here thanks to Tv Tropes. There does seem to be quite a large number of us here. <br><br>I love all things related to Persona 3 and 4. I haven&#39;t had the displesuare of encountering any badfics about them, but please be sure to report your findings sometime so that someday when we both have our Permission we can take them out together. On that note, what is your favorite P4 goodfic? I don&#39;t know who you ship with Yu/Souji, but since Naoto is your favorite, let me present with one of my personal favorites, <br> <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5196521/1/Fortuna-Favet-Fatuis%20">Fortuna Favet Fatuis</a>.<br><br> It is about Shouji going back in time after reaching the Bad End in December, with him getting back his memories at the time he makes the contract the second time around. There are a great deal of changes in relation to the game after this. It does ship him with Naoto, but I can&#39;t see that being a problem with you from what you have <br>stated. It also is unfortunately long since dead, but enjoy it while it last. I for one have read and re-read it many times.</p>

            <p>However, I&#39;ve only read P3 goodfics for the moment, using some Tv Tropes recs. However, I think I found P4 badfics, here they come :<br><br>- <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/10321140/1/Waking-up-in-P4"> Waking up in Persona 4 </a>, I swear, this only the debut of the plot, not even a murder, but the English is slaughtered, the &quot;MC&quot; is atrocious, she goes in the Personaverse after dying ... Could someone present her to the Reaper, please ?<br><br>- <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/11199125/1/Persona-4-Naoto-Verson"> Persona 4 Naoto Verson (the typo is in the title)</a>. This one is strange, not completly read it, but it make Naoto&#39;s story not really different from Yu&#39;s, several typos and non edited imitations of the game&#39;s lines in the first chapter, even Sukuna-Hikona uses izanagi&#39;s moveset. Really strange.<br><br>However, do you know the first Persona games too, and do you have them ? </p>

            <p>Because apparently people in the Americas were not good enough for Eternal Punishment either.<br>It is looking really good. It seems it will provide a nice contrast to P4. <br><br>I would have to get them both in the emulator if needed, because I no longer my PS and I don&#39;t have a PSP.<br><br>Okay, the first is really bad indeed. At least she doesn&#39;t instantly remember all the plot of P4, that would be the only thing that could make her more of a Sue than she already is.

            <p>Tomb of Horrors sounds <i>somewhat</i> familiar, but Acererak is lost on me. My memories of the exact plot and names are as shadowy as a Halfman&#39;s cloak, though, so I might have gotten there...<br><br>Oh, I know that feeling. You probably shouldn&#39;t start <i>The Stormlight Archive</i>: its books are over a thousand pages each. He has some short stories that probably wouldn&#39;t take more than an afternoon or so, if you wanted to try those out. <i>Sixth of the Dusk</i> is great; they all are, really. <br><br>-Alleb</p>

            <p>Be aware that I din&#39;t so much GMing, and never in the 4th Ed, the rules were not really appealing to me. However, I think that what I&#39;ll say is relevant for all the RPGs.<br><br>Your world need to be alive.<br><br>The PCs will need a setting with a real background, characters who will deal with them and won&#39;t be some extensions of your will, they&#39;ll need to care for the world where they will play. I don&#39;t know what&#39;s their classes, their tastes, but I know they&#39;ll quickly stop having fun if the setting is too much generic,if they feel they&#39;re interacting with you and not with your world. If it means you&#39;ll have to make some changes in-game, then don&#39;t be worried. If they&#39;re not going immediately for your latest dungeon with all the data you brainstormed so hard, don&#39;t be afraid. If it&#39;s really an important step of your world they&#39;ll eventually come here.<br>I think it&#39;s important too for the players to see the campaign&#39;s world change because of their actions, they&#39;ll get a sense of achievement, and I think that&#39;s important for a campaign. You can even initiate some changes by yourself, provided they&#39;re logical, for instance if a goblin horde loses it leaders to your PCs, some ogres and their ogre mage leader could enslave them, then be replaced by the hordes of the lich they&#39;re were fleeing in the fisrt place... Your campaign must not be a mere set, it must achieve its own existence.<br><br>Morever, never forget Rule Zero : &quot;Have fun, every single one of you&quot;.<br><br>P.S. : It could feel ridiculous, but check Darths and Droids and GM of the Ring. You&#39;ll see what&#39;s make a bad or a good GM here.</p>

            <p>It is agreed that &#39;green&#39; points to a certain colour. However, there is nothing in the particular word &#39;green&#39; that means that colour has to be called by it; &#39;vert&#39; and &#39;ירוק&#39; also equally point to that colour.

            <p>I mean, we all know that &#39;[English is] the language of Shakespear and Milton and The Bible&#39; (<i>Pygmalion</i>, George Bernard Shaw), so perhaps you ought to simply accept that all other languages are just made up to be difficult?

When the holder makes contact with a target, it deals an additional Fire-type attack at 60 Base Power using the holder&#39;s Attack stat. It&#39;s expensive, but you also get more money from battles. However, it&#39;s a one-use-only item and ill-suited for competitive use, though the extra damage can be nice for Golurk to hit through a pesky substitute or ensure a kill with, say, Phantom Force.</p>

            <p>Naoto is my favorite for P4 cast, too.<br><br>Never played Persona Q, but it appears to be a great game.

            <p>Lack of localisation: the curse of being a FE fan.

            <p>The big one seems to be an overall weak plot in comparison to the rest of the series. Then there are the people who complain about the lack of a true &quot;Hard&quot; difficulty - it jumps straight from the tame Hard to the utterly insane Lunatic. I&#39;ve also heard it said that the protagonists behave like a bunch of sociopaths. Then there&#39;s the usual refrain of &#39;it&#39;s catering to casuals so it suxxorz lol&#39;. And there&#39;s hating on the DLC.<br>Yeah, I&#39;ve been on IGN too much.</p>

            <p>The game is not perfect, but hey, they&#39;re never perfect. However, I fail to see how the protagonists are sociopaths, it appears a little over the top here. Besides, this guys would be complaining much more if the series died with Awakening, because there would be no hope of better games in the future.</p>

            <p>I haven&#39;t played White in a while, so the only specific recommendation I have is &quot;get the Larvesta egg once it&#39;s available to you, I&#39;m told Volcarona are awesome&quot;. ^^;</p>

            <p>It&#39;s only my opinion, but I think that getting a Ghost type could be a good idea, Chandelure and Golurk seem pretty neat for me, and not only for the Elite 4. Besides, if you want to do a Nuzlocke, a Ghost type will soak up all the Explosion of the world. Other Nuzlockers could think it&#39;s a bad idea, but I already saved some of my Pokemons this way with my Misdreavus in my Pearl Nuzlocke.</p>

            <p>DID SOMEBODY SAY POKéMON?!<br><br>What sort of suggestions do you want? Which starter to pick?<br><br>It&#39;s generally accepted that Oshawott gives you the easiest run and Snivy the hardest, but it really all comes down to personal preference. Just remember to always have a well-balanced team with good coverage, and you&#39;ll be ready for anything! <s>except that final boss god i hate that final boss augh</s></p>

            <p>I... chose Snivy anyway. &gt;_&gt; <br>I love her -- she&#39;s just so snaky and attitudinal. Also, apparently Purrloin is kinda terrible until it gets Fury Swipes? Valefor, my Purrloin, is using Cut as his main attack now. Because he can&#39;t deal any damage otherwise. Hopefully he&#39;ll do better as a Liepard. <br><br>My Lilipup, however, is pretty great. She&#39;s nearly as useful as Zeta, and she&#39;s also brought me a great ball, a full heal, and a hyper potion. <br><br>I fought the first gym, too! The only really eventful parts of that were: the level 4 Patrat I caught because he was the first one and I wasn&#39;t sure if I was doing a nuzlocke yet (I decided not to) took one of the &quot;two turns charging up moves&quot; which probably would have been an OHKO for Valefor. The other one was my Panpour super-effective critically hitting the gym leader&#39;s fire monkey for an OHKO. </p>
