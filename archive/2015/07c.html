            <p>I&#39;m not British, but I use British spelling for most things. I can&#39;t remember the American spellings for most words, either. I&#39;m just curious if anyone else does this.

I use American-style double quote marks there, and I&#39;m not really sure why. <br><br>I just know the doubles as speech marks and the singles as quote marks, but I don&#39;t know where/why I picked up that quirk.

            <p>You had a question about double &quot;speech marks&quot; vs single &#39;quote marks&#39; somewhere in the TOS beta, I think. It might be of interest to everyone, so I&#39;ll answer here.<br><br>The truth is, that&#39;s not actually a rule—in fact, the rule is to be consistent and only use different marks when you&#39;ve got nested quotes, like if a character is quoting something out loud. (If you&#39;re wondering, the solution to an awkward situation of a quote butting up against dialogue is to rewrite the passage so that doesn&#39;t happen.)<br><br>I don&#39;t know where the tendency to use doubles for dialogue and singles for other material came from, though I&#39;d love to find out. It&#39;s definitely non-standard. On the other hand, it seems to be more and more widely used, so for all I know it could become accepted. *shrugs*<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Now that you mentioned it, I realize that I prefer double quotes even when writing British, probably because they don’t look like apostrophes. It makes the text appear much more clear and orderly to me.<br><br>HG</p>

            <p>I’m neither British nor American. I learned British English at school, but later I read lots of American texts. So, when I don’t use a spell checker, I probably mix it and use just what I remember best. Also, I may not always be aware that a word is specifically British or specifically American.<br><br>But then I try to always use a spell checker, and my main fandoms are British, so I should really try to write British English. On the other hand, my spell checkers default settings are German and American, and setting it to British is a bit tedious. So I actually write mostly American English. Unless I take the time and can justify the extra afford, like when I beta read for Brits. <br><br>HG</p>

            <p>I came across by chance and it looks fun, but I wondered if anyone has any experience with it.<br>Apparently it has a setting not unlike the PPC universe where human fiction (and older myths and legends) form their own pocket dimensions.

            <p>No experience with it, but I like the idea of being able to hop into different settings. That sounds like a good way of keeping things fresh and interesting over a long campaign. <br><br>One thing I&#39;m not fond of is that it seems to use custom dice, which I always just find a bit annoying. They don&#39;t look too custom though, so it&#39;s probably easy enough to play with a standard set.<br><br>- Irish</p>

            <p>In our world there is reality TV, no surprise there, and many of them are lack luster at best, but there some that are really good. What comes to mind when I think of good reality is Keeping up with the Kardashians... That&#39;s obviously a joke. Impractical Jokers is my favorite reality show, because it&#39;s just funny.<br><br>Feel free to add you favorites.</p>

            <p>It&#39;s your standard dance competition show, except now I can&#39;t watch it because our TV reception kinda sucks. They eliminate a guy and a girl every week after the Vegas callbacks, and the dancers have to perform in styles they aren&#39;t necessarily trained in (a ballet dancer might be given a hip-hop number, for example).</p>

            <p>I honestly can&#39;t believe I&#39;m saying that, but yeah. I have one.<br><br>It&#39;s called &quot;Whodunnit?&quot;. It only ran one season, unfortunately. The idea: a murder mystery like Clue in a house like Big Brother. The guests compete/work together to solve the murders, but one of them is the murderer. Great idea, leading to lots of great scenarios - one murder to solve each episode. But the best part? The creator referred to the show as &quot;reality fiction&quot; - as in, it took the generally accepted conceit that reality TV is semi-staged, ran with it, and had as much fun as it could. It is cheesy as hell, and that&#39;s the point. Watch it with that in mind, and you&#39;ll have a blast.</p>

            <p>Hoom, hoom.<br><br><b>Activity:</b> <s>Do I know you?</s> I think I should stop using this joke.<br><br><b>PPC knowledge:</b> I have not spotted any lore-related blunders.<br><br><b>Fic to spork:</b> I don&#39;t know PJO. However, I asked Ix, and her response was<br>&quot;NOPE<br>NOPE<br>ALL OF MY NOPE&quot;<br>so I assume it&#39;s a very bad badfic.<br><br><b>Writing ability (creative):</b> Characters are good, VJ is especially entertaining; furthermore, I don&#39;t remember seeing an agent that cares less about badfic in the way you described VJ, so kudos for originality. The prompts flow nicely and the jokes are good (except the penis one in the profile, that&#39;s a bit immature, IMHO).<br><br><b>Writing ability (technical):</b> Can I get a creaky door? No? Oh well. <br>-Your SPaG is still sub-par. There are tense shifts, missing words, missing plurals, instances of weird word order and so on. I recommend either getting a beta that speaks English as a first language or getting someone like Hieronymus Graubart (our resident Greybeard is an awesome beta — HG, you get this shiny medal!), because your current betas did not catch those errors.<br>-Your treatment of vulgarity confuses me. On one hand, you basically make a penis joke in Venus&#39; profile. On the other hand, you censor &#39;sh*t&#39;. And on the other other hand, shoving sticks up someone&#39;s arse is totally fine...? Only censoring <i>some</i> of the profanity is really weird and not terribly consistent, either. You need to choose one way and stick with it.<br>-There is a possible canon breach in your second prompt; to wit, William sends Greyback to Azkaban. That&#39;s fanon; the only time he could have been in Azkaban is post-Battle of Hogwarts, and there is no certain information about that time, so he might be dead, or on the run, or something.<br><br>So: while you have shown improvement in the characters department, your technical writing still requires work. I&#39;m sorry, but Permission Denied.</p>

            <p>But I&#39;m gonna defend it a little bit.<br><br>- From what I know, Voyd is an American and Irish is... well, Irish, so I would assume they speak English as their first language.<br><br>- I&#39;m sorry, could you show me the part where I censored something? Because, honestly, I&#39;ve re-read both prompts twice and honestly did not see any moment of censorship.

            <p>Your SPaG needs work.<br><br>I mean absolutely no offense to anyone when I say this, but Voyd&#39;s strength as a beta seems to be in story flow, and Irish, if his <i>Red Dwarf</i> mission was anything to judge by, isn&#39;t the best SPaG beta, either. My apologies to both of you, I don&#39;t mean that to be rude. I&#39;m stating a fact based on what I have seen. The other two betas I haven&#39;t interacted with enough to know how well they work (SMF has beta&#39;d for me a few times but s/he&#39;s usually a latecomer, so there aren&#39;t as many mistakes to catch and I have no idea how s/he&#39;d fare in an unbeta&#39;d piece, and I don&#39;t believe I&#39;ve ever worked with Edhelistar, but I have noticed his SPaG is a bit shaky at times). Again, I mean absolutely no offense, I am just pointing out my observations. I apologize in advance if I upset anyone.<br><br><img src="http://cdn.meme.am/instances/58464007.jpg" alt="http://cdn.meme.am/instances/58464007.jpg"> <br><br>I&#39;m not so sure if the word &#39;censorship&#39; is totally correct, since you said &#39;beating the hay out of each other&#39; rather than &#39;beating the sh*t out of each other&#39;, and considering you had no problem saying &#39;arse&#39; later, it jumped out as odd. I don&#39;t believe there&#39;s really a term for this in English other than <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bowdlerise">Bowlderization</a>.<br><br>And it&#39;s not just the SPaG; word order also gave me some &#39;huh?&#39; moments, such as <i>&quot;What&#39;s the movie?&quot; he asked his partner, who was clearly enjoying the picture, with her legs stretched on the Console, and multiple bottles of soda on the floor.</i> The order makes it sound like William is addressing his partner <i>and</i> the bottles of soda.<br><br>Another thing I noticed was improper dialogue tags. For example: <i>&quot;Nice,&quot; VJ grinned, looking at the bowl.</i> From the comma placement, it leads me to assume she&#39;s grinning her lines, rather than saying them <i>while</i> grinning. You can sigh, you can laugh, you can yell, or you can say lines, but you can&#39;t grin lines, shrug lines, et cetera et cetera.<br><br>And, um, even in the 1996 mass breakout, Greyback wasn&#39;t one of the escapees. The ones that broke out were, Dolohov, Mulciber, Rookwood, the three Lestranges, Travers, and three unnamed Death Eaters. (That right there should have been a clue; Greyback was allowed to wear Death Eater robes but not take the Dark Mark because he wasn&#39;t up to Voldemort&#39;s hiring standards.)<br><br>I really shouldn&#39;t be having to back Des up because when a PG says Permission granted/denied, the other PGs trust their judgement because we tend to know what we&#39;re doing. But for the record, I agree: everything looks fine, save for the technical aspect of your writing.</p>

            <p>Obviously I can&#39;t speak for Desdendelle, but if you want an explanation of the problems with your SPaG, here are the mistakes I noticed.  I&#39;ve no idea which (if any) of these are the ones that bothered Des, but it might give you some idea of where to start fixing things.<br><br><h1>William&#39;s profile</h1>
<br><ul>
<li>
<i>Like all warlocks from the continuum, he has a mark - a unique body trait, which identifies him as a non-human</i><br><br>Either replace the dash with a comma, or the comma with a dash.</li>
<br><li>
<i>The only times he is not, is when shocked, thinking deeply, or embarrassed.</i><br><br>Lose the first comma.  Also replace &quot;is when&quot; with &quot;are when&quot; because &quot;times&quot; is plural.</li>
<br><li>
<i>He was born with ivory white skin, but it didn&#39;t raise a lot of suspicion - people tend to think he may be of weak condition</i><br><br>Should be &quot;people tended to think he was of weak condition&quot;.  You might also want to replace &quot;of weak condition&quot; with something less clinical-sounding and more suited to the melodramatic Victorian context, such as &quot;a sickly child&quot;.</li>
<br><br><li>
<i>At that time, his other warlock mark has manifested and with it - his magic.</i><br><br>Should be &quot;manifested&quot;, not &quot;has manifested&quot;.  Also, there should be a dash before &quot;with it&quot;.</li>
<br><li>
<i>It started small; cutlery moving on the table, plumes of smoke and sparks coming from his fingertips, toys and small objects vanishing and reappearing in different places, etc.</i><br><br>Use a colon to start a list, not a semicolon.<br><br>However, you might want to think about using semicolons instead of commas in this list.  I know some people don&#39;t like semicolons used this way, but at present the list looks like it might be saying the sparks came from his fingertips and also from toys and from the vanishing and reappearing small objects.<br><br>The alternative is to break the long list up into smaller sentences: &quot;It started small. Cutlery moved on the table. Plumes of smoke and sparks came from his fingertips. Toys and small objects vanished and reappeared in different places.&quot; This has the added advantage that the small sentences help to convey the smallness of how it started.  A big big list doesn&#39;t look small to the reader.</li>
<br><li>
<i>the neighbours started gossiping about their family being cursed and condemned</i><br><br>Are you sure &quot;condemned&quot; is the word you want?</li>
<br><li>
<i>She didn&#39;t know the true identity of the child&#39;s father but she believed the Lord and His teachings will absolve the boy of all that is wrong with him.</i><br><br>Should be &quot;His teachings would absolve the boy of all that was wrong with him.&quot;  It&#39;s in our past, even if it was in her present or future.</li>
<br><li>
<i>When William ceased aging, as every warlock does eventually, he decided to travel the continent</i><br><br>Not a SPaG issue, but why only the continent?  This was the 1890s, when the British Empire was at its height.  Why wouldn&#39;t he visit India or Africa as well?</li>
<br><li>
<i>Because of his demon blood, he is able to generate energy using his own stamina (or life force, if the spell is more powerful) in order to reshape reality. Because of his demon blood he is able to harness energy from his surroundings, and can use this with his own stamina (or life force, if the spell is more powerful) in order to reshape reality.</i><br><br>Duplicate sentence.</li>
<br><li>
<i>running water, and holy water, works best</i><br><br>Should be &quot;running water and holy water work best&quot;.</li>
<br><li>
<i>and there is only a handful of warlocks who can do it.</i><br><br>Replace &quot;is&quot; with &quot;are&quot; unless you mean that there is literally a hand that is full of warlocks.</li>
</ul>
<br><h1>VJ&#39;s profile</h1>
<br><ul>
<li>
<i>Venus does not actually hate her name, it&#39;s the attention it brings her that&#39;s extremely annoying.</i><br><br>Either replace the comma with a semicolon, or start a new sentence.</li>
<br><li>
<i>She is a very playful individual, and enjoys teasing her friends, such as when mocking her partner about his age, making provocative comments which make some people wonder if she’s related to Luxury, or having frequent &quot;Trivia Wars&quot; with William to determine who knows canon worlds better.</i><br><br>Another long list sentence.  Once again it might work better if broken into smaller pieces.</li>
<br><li>
<i>Later, her love for literature was so strong, she has decided to abandon her college life</i><br><br>Lose the &quot;has&quot;.</li>
<br><li>
<i>This led to a misunderstanding with her parents, which made Venus run away and find shelter in a nearby forest.</i><br><br>Not a SPaG issue, but didn&#39;t she have any friends she could stay with?</li>
<br><li>
<i>At first, VJ was confused and almost fainted when she learned the Organization can visit her favourite stories at any time.</i><br><br>The confusion, the almost-fainting, and the learning were all the first thing that happened?  Change the order of the sentence to something like, &quot;VJ was confused at first, but then she almost fainted when she learned the Organization could visit her favourite stories at any time.&quot;<br><br>Also replace &quot;can&quot; with &quot;could&quot;, because what excited her was the fact the Organization already had the ability to do it in her present (i.e. our past).  Yes, it also can also do it in our present (i.e. an unspecified point in her future) but this wasn&#39;t relevant to her almost fainting.</li>
<br><li>
<i>Despite the majority of spies hating searching for badfics, reading and classifying them - VJ was having the time of her life.</i><br><br>That dash looks clumsy.  So does the use of &quot;hating&quot; in one grammatical context immediately followed by other &quot;-ing&quot; words in another, totally different, grammatical context.<br><br>Anyway, think about rewriting the sentence to something like, &quot;Even though the majority of spies hated searching for, reading, and classifying badfics, VJ was having the time of her life.&quot;</li>
<br><li>
<i>She had fun browsing through the Pit and other places, in order to find the abominations of literature. It was also there when, after her first paycheck, she bought a worn-out coat from the General Store.</i><br><br>I&#39;m not sure what &quot;It&quot; refers to in this context.  The last single noun mentioned was the Pit.  Was the FFN website really in the General Store with her when she bought the coat?</li>
<br><li>
<i>Since that time, she would wear the coat everywhere she could.</i><br><br>Replace &quot;she would wear&quot; with &quot;she wore&quot; since even though that&#39;s our past-stretching-into-our-present and her present-stretching-into-her-future, it still has its roots in our past and her present, so that&#39;s what counts.  (Sometimes I think English tenses were designed by <a href="http://hitchhikers.wikia.com/wiki/Time_Traveler%27s_Handbook_of_1001_Tense_Formations">Dr Dan Streetmentioner</a>!)</li>
<br><li>
<i>she requested a transfer to the Department of Mary Sues. While working for the DoI, this was the Department she was reporting badfics to the most.</i><br><br>Replace &quot;this&quot; with &quot;that&quot;, because it looks like she was reporting badfics to the DoI while working there.</li>
</ul>

            <p>... writing fanfic for the canons in question?<br><br>I&#39;ve had plenty of ideas for <i>Lord of the Rings</i> characters, but I haven&#39;t dropped them into the PPC.

            <p>You don&#39;t even necessarily have to publish it, either. I have an entire file on my computer hashing out the details of multiple human-Pokemon hybrids (and a little over a chapter of a fanfic where said hybrids are/were essentially child soldiers), but I could never use one of them as an agent.

            <p>Not all fanfics need to be published - or even finished! I have-- hang on a second.<br><br>Right. On my hard drive, I have at least ten short fanfics which are finished (to a greater or lesser extent), but have never been published on a major website. Some of them have gone up on my Livejournal; others have never been read by anyone but me. Then there are the half-written long stories which I started based on a cool idea, and lost interest in once the idea was sketched out.

            <p>You can still attempt to pass the ideas on if you want, you may be the only expert, but some of us are familiar with Monster Musume, So you could always see if anyone is interested.  But ultimately the short answer is you can always file that seed away for a later date.  You never know when you might need another character.  <br><br>But of course, there is always an issue when you have a partially created character, you never want to leave it quite alone, but not really want to pass it off to someone else.  When that happens, I just file it in the back of mind and let it mature there.    </p>

            <p>Yes, you&#39;ve read it right.<br><br>A thing you should know about me - I&#39;m a big fan of Epic Rap Battles of History. In case you didn&#39;t know, it&#39;s a YouTube channel which makes two historical (or fictional, or currently living) figures having a rap battle. The pairs usuallt have a common theme (i.e. Freddie Mercury vs Frank Sinatra, Bob Ross vs Pablo Picasso), or really random (Hulk Hogan vs Kim Jong Il, Genghis Khan vs the Easter Bunny).<br><br>And of course, where there&#39;s an original idea, there are parodies... some better, some worse... there is a series which does &quot;Princess Rap Battles&quot;. It&#39;s generally not that bad, but certainly not as good... but one time... they&#39;ve done <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9qfaTBCYSA">THIS</a><br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>And I was drinking coffee at that time... now, I have a lot of cleaning to do.<br><br>As for my opinion: I have no knowledge about rap music, bars and lyrics, so I can&#39;t say anything here but...<br><br>WOW... As much as I love Mary Poppins, I love the movie but... Mrs Claus DESTROYED her! :D<br><br>And what&#39;s your opinion?</p>

            <p>Sorry, but Mary Poppins wins for the &quot;dependent Claus&quot; pun alone. Nothing else topped that for me. It&#39;s a shame Bert&#39;s part wasn&#39;t very good, though.<br><br>... And then &quot;Galadriel vs. Leia&quot; autoplayed, and I&#39;m sad to say Leia kicked Galadriel&#39;s butt. Alas, it seems they were working from the movies alone.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>From what I&#39;ve seen in the IRC, you wouldn&#39;t stop when clearly asked a couple of times to stop. I don&#39;t know what you were thinking, but yelling things about (pardon my French, no offense) baby-rape is certainly not a way of keeping people by your side. <br><br>Ever since I&#39;ve been here, April 2015, I had nothing but positive, kind, and helpful response from the PPC. No bullying, insults, threats, ridiculing my writing - nothing. And I&#39;m sure I&#39;m not the only one. So maybe the problem is not on the PPC side...?<br><br>Face it, man, if you cannot handle critique, and people disliking your work - you don&#39;t have balls (or, ovaries, if you&#39;re a girl) to be an author. Instead, you&#39;re reaching for your only defense - threats and complaints, where it is YOU who have a real problem. I saw you speaking highly of yourself - being the next Tim Shafer of gaming... if those ambitions were so high, while you were trying writing - it seems somebody must&#39;ve fooled you badly.<br><br>Don&#39;t try to be intimidating, man. You can&#39;t do anything to these guys. Even if all writing communities will hate the PPC - nothing will change. It will still operate. Instead, try to learn how to handle critique. And what do you think will happen if somebody will criticize your games? Will you threaten to destroy every single gamer there is?<br><br>Step out of your comfort zone, and face the real life. It won&#39;t give you all you want on a silver platter. You could&#39;ve step away from the PPC and find a writing community you&#39;d feel more welcome in. Instead, you&#39;ve set yourself a goal to insult, threaten and - honestly - annoy people. Tell me, was it worth it? </p>

            <p>Doctor Peep&#39;s an OC who was the super-importantest villain in the FNAF canon... according to the (fictional) badfic from whence she came. It&#39;s alluded to that she&#39;s responsible for her homefic&#39;s version of the Bite Of &#39;87, for instance, which - aside from the murders - is the defining event of FNAF canon, for those unfamiliar with the series. She&#39;s a bird animatronic, yeah, but she&#39;s not Chica or a replacement of her. Fully original character on the Donut-Steele Index.<br><br>She got better, though. =]<br><br>Also, the name comes from a child psychiatrist who played a major role in the darkly hilarious cop show <i>No Offence</i>, which I encourage you to check out because when was the last time you saw female-led cop dramas that didn&#39;t suck? </p>

            <p>And, um, yes I did, but I was rather snowed under with my course and there, er, wasn&#39;t a huge amount to talk about. The British English you needed was minimal because of how you structured the story, and your SPaG was its usual excellent self. The person I really think you should contact, though, is Iximaz - she&#39;s much more knowledgeable about the minutiae of HP canon than I am and she&#39;ll be able to spot whether or not a spell is canon to a much more accurate degree than I ever could. =]</p>

            <p>Since I had the book in front of me, I’m quite confident that I didn’t mess with the canon. I’m more afraid of unintentionally using Americanisms, not giving my protagonists enough personality or throwing them OOC. Yep, I should have mentioned what I’m looking for.

            <p>The diary format worked really well - it&#39;s quite rare to get into a character&#39;s head like that. <br><br>The inside of her head isn&#39;t exactly a fun place to be (I guess we blame her former trainer for that), but it was interesting. <br><br>I like the way she talked to the diary as if it were a person.

            <p>Although how much help I can be rather depends on what continuum your mission is in. <br><br>For future reference, mentioning the canon(s) involved when you ask is useful, as it lets people know if they can help or not. Likewise, mentioning any special skills you&#39;d like, such as someone to check punctuation if you&#39;re not completely confident in your own SPaG, or some to Britpick, is worthwhile.

            <p>In case nobody knows, I&#39;m developing a video game. I decided to borrow an element from Mass Effect that I loved, which was the in-game codex. Three questions about that:<br><br>Uno: Should I give all the different playable factions different catalogues of game-world-thingies?<br><br>Zwei: I need to mention the casualties somewhere, so what do you think would have more impact? Mention that few soldiers manage to live past fifteen(The conscription age), say the amount of time soldiers last on the field(Few seconds), or that the average unit has twelve million soldiers and sustains eighty-percent casualties per deployment? All of these examples come from &#39;The Armada&#39; who are the main good guys. The other three allied forces are much different.<br><br>Trzy: I was going to give any accessible school(There are a few that you cane see inside of) a shooting range, in order to prepare the students to defend the school against the enemy. Do you think I should stock them with non-training ammunition? Most of the other shooting ranges have free training ammo, and I want to add some variety to the loot table.</p>

            <p>1) Having differences in the catalogues could be good, and might even add to the replay value of the game. Are you thinking of giving entries on different topics for the different factions, or giving entries with different viewpoints on the same topic (or a mix)?<br><br>One thing that I will caution you on, regardless of exactly how you implement the catalogue, is not to spend too long on it. The only game I play with a big system like this is <i>Star Wars: The Old Republic</i>, which has an in-game codex. You get new entries the first time you enter a new area, the first time you encounter a new species, and upon interacting with certain key individuals. And you know what? My first play session, when my Imperial Agent was making his way through Hutta, I stopped and read every single one. My second play session, and every session afterwards, I didn&#39;t read any of them - because they interrupted the gameplay. <br><br>If you want your players to get this information, the best way to do it would be to bring it up in game: through narration, dialogue, plot coupons, etc. Having some extra detail for the players that want it will certainly be a nice bonus for them, but you&#39;ll probably find that the people who read through every entry are a minority. Your time will almost certainly be better spent on core game aspects. <br><br>2) I agree with Des: show, don&#39;t tell. I&#39;m assuming you&#39;ve already heard the phrase &#39;one death is a tragedy, a million is a statistic&#39;. You&#39;re asking which one has the most impact. Honestly, none of them have that much impact. You&#39;re asking me to imagine the deaths of tens of millions of people in one go - I can&#39;t even image ten million people all standing together in one space. It&#39;s just too big a number for me to get my head around. I&#39;m not really going to care about them. <br><br>If you want impact, then your audience has to have an emotional investment - you need to make it personal. <br><br>Show us a soldier. Show him going through training, and how he spends longer being trained than he survives in his first fight. Then show us that his situation is hardly unique. <br><br>3) The answer to this question depends on exactly what you mean by &#39;prepare the students to defend the school against the enemy&#39;. Are you meaning that they will be preparing (by learning to shoot) and that they will then defend the school (and everything else around) by fighting on far-flung battlefields so that the enemy never gets near the school? Or are you meaning that the school itself is in danger of being directly attacked?  <br><br>In the first case, there is no reason to have live ammo lying around (and as Des has pointed out, some very compelling reasons <i>not</i> to have it). <br><br>In the second case, I can&#39;t see how they would be able to actually defend the place <i>without</i> live ammo. Training them up to do so, then withholding the actual weapons that they would need, would be a fairly pointless exercise. <br><br>- Irish</p>

            <p>I thought it was a very good looking review. I&#39;ll have to make time to look at it in depth, later, though. Based on your quick verdict down there, I&#39;m glad you weren&#39;t disappointed. Assuming, of course, that &#39;Mad&#39; means &#39;Awesome&#39; as it does in my language. In any case, I hope to see more movie reviews from you, as we seem to have a shortage of good ones.</p>

            <p>You did a great job of being informative and evaluative without just recapping the whole thing.  I thought you raised some very thoughtful points in there, too.  You also managed to write a review about something you really enjoyed without just ranting about how good it was, which is a major talent.  I look forward to seeing more movie reviews from you.<br><br>I feel like a bit of a weenie for asking this, but exactly how gory is it?  I have much lower tolerance for live-action gore than I do animated - I&#39;m fine with Attack on Titan and Fallout, but Kingsmen was a little too much for me.  Plus, I&#39;ve been wondering if my mom would like it, since she&#39;s pretty fond of action movies and car chases, but she&#39;s even more sensitive about violence than I am.</p>

            <p>It is less gory than Attack on Titan. I mean, let me think... OK, someone gets grazed with a bullet (in addition to lots of people getting shot, but you don&#39;t really get focuses on blood there,) a War Boy gets crossbow bolts in his face and shoulder (but there&#39;s not blood,) and the way that [spoiler spoiler] but that really doesn&#39;t get too much... I dunno, focus? There&#39;s some gore but it&#39;s not lovingly panned over by the camera, and there&#39;s no ludicrous amounts of fake blood being spilled around.<br><br>Though, the fight scenes are very brutal. There&#39;s a bit where Furiosa and Max fight, and it is very - well, it&#39;s basically the opposite of Black Widow flipping around like an acrobatic death machine. <br><br>I think that you should be OK watching it - the movie is very good. The only thing is that it might be hard to find it in theaters. I went to see it with my dad the other day and we had to go to this little theater 40 minutes away to see it.<br><br>(by the way! If you get nitpicky about medicine, this movie is very good about that. George Miller used to be an ER doctor, and it shows. So if you see the movie and wonder if [spoiler event with a knife] is accurate, it is basically a crude version of a real medical procedure that a cop like Max probably would know.)</p>

            <p>This movie is ridiculously long. No, seriously. When we got out of it and checked the listings, we discovered that it was <i>two hours and ten freaking minutes.</i> Most of the movies we see aren&#39;t much longer than ninety minutes.<br><br>And yeah, there&#39;s some scenes of intense violence, but there actually isn&#39;t much blood to spill (not in the usual way, anyway - though the fact that Max is actively shown being used as a bloodbag throughout the first third of the movie deserves mention). I think the major reason this movie is rated R is likely the adult topics being explored, such as the treatment of women. ESPECIALLY the treatment of women.</p>

            <p>Have you seen some of the behind the scenes videos? I personally love this one:<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zgkawcew2u8"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zgkawcew2u8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zgkawcew2u8</a></a><br><br>Fun fact, Charlize Theron was actually the one who decided the War Boys would be bald. Apparently quite a few of the stunt doubles were annoyed they&#39;d have to shave their heads for the roles.<br><br>(Actually, speaking of behind-the-scenes stuff, there was so much going on. Charlize Theron and the Wives went rolling down hills to get appropriately dirty rather than sit for hours in makeup. Hugh Keays-Byrne was Team Dad to all the War Boy actors and hung up motivational posters. Charlize Theron taught the actor playing Nux how to knit and he made Christmas presents. Tom Hardy made bracelets for people. And best of all (IMO) the stunt doubles for Max and Furiosa actually fell in love and are now married with a kid.)<br><br>...I gotta say, you keep calling the Many Mothers&#39; land the Green Land. It&#39;s the Green Place, darnit! (*pedant pedant*)<br><br>&quot;Women are treated almost like livestock&quot; nope, not even almost. They are livestock in the eyes of Joe and the Citadel. <br><br>Mad Max Fury Road really isn&#39;t in a timeline with the other Mad Max movies. There are bits of continuity - the Interceptor, Max having a leg brace, Max&#39;s leather jacket (which is apparently the same one Mel Gibson wore!) - but in Miller&#39;s own words, the Mad Max movies are more like... legends of the man called Mad Max, rather than a straightforward narrative. </p>

There is not one single point where Max actively seeks out being a hero until it is forced upon him.  He ACTIVELY TELLS PEOPLE WHO ASK HIM FOR HELP to take a hike.<br><br>Mad Max himself would like nothing better than to never, ever, ever be the main character.<br><br>He would also like for people to stop stealing his ...ing car.</i>&quot;</p>

            <p>Fixed the Green Place thing. Whoops!<br><br>And yeah, good call on Max actively avoiding most of the drama-fest in the previous films, too. I think part of the reason for the movie not being a direct continuation was because it went through a really long development hell prior to its release, and it was like what, 30 years after the previous film? A lot of things happened between that time and this, not just on the part of the director and his other works but also because of the times changing for the cast and such. Especially Mel Gibson. As noted in the review, I haven&#39;t seen the original films, but as far as Max is concerned, Tom Hardy&#39;s performance was good enough for me, personally.</p>

            <p>Well y&#39;know, George Miller was the director for all of the Mad Max films. Which kind of makes it hilarious when people complain that whoever directed Fury Road <i>clearly</i> didn&#39;t understand Miller&#39;s work.<br><br>Actually, there&#39;s something kind of weird about the Mad Max timeline. I mean, first of all: At the start of the film, during the scene of the War Boys leaving, there&#39;s a chant:<br><br><i>&quot;We are War Boys!&quot;<br>&quot;War Boys!&quot;<br>&quot;Kami-crazy War Boys!&quot;<br>&quot;War Boys!&quot;<br>&quot;Fukushima Kami-Crazy War Boys!&quot; </i><br><br>So this is a film that in-universe takes place after the Fukushima nuclear incident in 2011 - obviously it can&#39;t be in the same timeline as the movies where the apocalypse came in the 80s. <br><br>Another thing: We see three characters who suggest that they lived in pre-Wasteland times. There&#39;s one of the Vulvalini ladies, who mentions how everyone had a show in the old world (and it sounds like she&#39;s talking from her own memory.) There&#39;s Immortan Joe, who was an actual colonel in the Australian military during the wars according to supplemental materials. Both of these characters are quite old.<br><br>And then there&#39;s Max, whose opening narration very strongly implies that he lived through the nuclear apocalypse. Yet he only looks about as old as Furiosa, who was definitely born after some of the apocalyptic wars - long enough after for the Vuvalini to have developed multiple clans and a distinct culture. <br><br>Considering Miller&#39;s ridiculous attention to detail (if you were so much as a background War Boy, you got to design your own costume, but every piece and detail had to have a backstory and a reason why your character had it) this had to have been intentional. It just adds to the idea of Max as a pseudo-legendary figure, in my opinion (and I&#39;ve actually seen goodfic positing that Max is literally ageless and immortal.) </p>

A radio is placed on top of a cooler beside her, playing a fast tuned beat at a low volume.<br><br>“I can’t believe we’ve never gone to a nice beach like this before.” She brushed some sand off of her stomach and her bat-themed bikini. “It’s relaxing, I guess.”<br><br>Mark gave a snort, sitting on the sand before the waves and reading a thick book.

            <p>The Guardsman looked down at his clothing. &quot;What? It&#39;s not inappropriate or anything. Shorts, shirt, webbing, equipment-- what&#39;s wrong?&quot; He idly twiddled with his laser screwdriver. &quot;I have the right to do this, you know.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I&#39;ll tell you what&#39;s wrong,&quot; replied Naya, fiddling with the RC&#39;s disguise generator. &quot;You&#39;re <i>working</i>. On a <i>beach</i>. On your <i>off time</i>. That&#39;s what&#39;s wrong here.&quot;<br><br><font><font size="2">&quot;But we need to test the solar power umbilical power supply,&quot;</font></font> said Terabyte, raising a finger. <font><font size="2">&quot;A sunny beach would be the perfect place to fine-tune the system. Furthermore, you <i>do</i> know about my platform&#39;s recent battery problems...&quot;</font></font><br><br>&quot;Yes, fine, I get it,&quot; grumbled Naya. &quot;I hope you two nerds have fun with your science experiments. Emiran, don&#39;t get sand everywhere or I will personally have you clean TB&#39;s micro-servos with a cotton swab.&quot;<br><br>The Guardsman fake saluted. &quot;Whatever you say, ma&#39;am. Say, what disguise did you pick this time?&quot;<br><br>Naya shrugged. &quot;Human. It&#39;s a pretty okay body, if a little unnerving. They have five fingers. Five! that&#39;s, like, two too many.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Will you use your real face for this?&quot; asked the Guardsman. &quot;Come on. It&#39;s been a while since we&#39;re working together. Can I at least know what you look like beneath that visor?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Nope!&quot; said Naya cheerfully as she applied the disguise to herself. A moment later, she was transformed into an Indian woman with wavy black hair. She wore a simple black one-piece bathing suit. The disguised quarian grabbed a beach towel from the RC table and said: &quot;So, are we gonna go or what?&quot;<br><br><font><font size="2">&quot;Let&#39;s go,&quot;</font></font> said Terabyte and typed in a command on the console. A portal opened in the middle of the RC, leading to the beach. <font><font size="2">&quot;Emiranlanoamar, I&#39;ll get the equipment ready on this end. Please take the solar panels and the wiring outside.&quot;</font></font><br><br>&quot;Got it,&quot; said the Guardsman, grabbing a folded-up array of solar panels and moving through the portal. &quot;I&#39;ll give you a shout when I&#39;m ready.&quot;<br><br>Naya snorted and made a dash for the water. &quot;Later, losers!&quot; she yelled. As she ran across the beach, she looked up at the sun and felt the breeze across her skin. Ah, freedom. Thank goodness for disguise generators: apart from the clean room, they were the only way to escape her environmental suit. Up ahead, there was a blonde woman in a white t-shirt. Naya shifted her course slightly to avoid running into her and barrelled past the Reader. &quot;&#39;Scuse me, coming through!&quot; <br></p>

            <p>Naya tried to turn around mid-sprint to look at her interlocutor but only succeeded in tripping over her own legs. She fell flat on her face mere centimetres away from the water. Before she could even push herself up a wave crashed over her head, soaking her and her towel.<br><br>Further up the beach, by the portal, the Guardsman roared with laughter. &quot;Boom, karma!

Hey. Um... hi.&quot;</p>

            <p>Naya glared at her partner, who was busy deploying the solar panels and hooking up power cords to machinery inside his RC though the portal. &quot;Look at him: he&#39;s shoved all of his tools in his webbing&#39;s pouches and is strutting around like some sort of self-important... bah.&quot; She waved a hand dismissively in his direction. &quot;Don&#39;t wanna think about his stupidity.

            <p>&quot;So, did you come here alone? Where&#39;s Kozar?&quot; asked Naya. &quot;Is he stomping around this beach somewhere? &#39;Cause I have a really hard time imagining him relaxing. From the little I&#39;ve seen of him, he&#39;s always this super-intense guy: sitting around on a beach doesn&#39;t jive with my image of him.&quot; Naya tossed her towel to the side, away from the water. &quot;Well, gotta let this thing dry out.

            <p>&quot;Kozar&#39;s sitting somewhere, I think,&quot; she said. &quot;Probably with sand in his armor by now--he wouldn&#39;t take it off. He&#39;s probably hoping for an invasion of some sort. As for the water--&quot; Her smile turned mischievous. &quot;A dip sounds nice. Especially if the water is so good you want a second one.&quot; She glanced at the water, and then reached for the hem of her shirt, tugging it up and over her head, adding a slight shimmy to make the movement work. The shirt caught briefly on one arm, and then was removed, folded, and tossed aside, followed by her pants. Her shoes, of course, had been left in the RC; she knew that much about beaches, at least.<br><br>This, of course, left her in a purple two-piece swimsuit, which was very good for allowing her hair--in a ponytail instead of its usual bun--to brush against her skin whenever she moved or the wind caught it. It took several minutes before she stopped twitching.<br><br>&quot;Well, then,&quot; she said, and tugged her hair over her shoulder. She smiled at Naya. &quot;Shall we?&quot;</p>

Can you swim?&quot; she asked the Reader. <br><br>- - - <br><br>&quot;Oh, lordy. She&#39;s wading in,&quot; said the Guardsman, squinting at his partner from his vantage point up the beach.  &quot;Terabyte, keep the portal generator on standby: I&#39;ll spot for you.

I swear, one moment I&#39;m trying to get a bead on her, the next minute I&#39;m bleeding all over the place and I get a mouthful of DIA-issue steel toed boot.&quot;<br><br>&quot;<font><font size="2">I believe that is called a &#39;wombo combo&#39;,</font></font>&quot; said Terabyte.<br><br>The Guardsman laughed. &quot;You said it, partner. This guy was the real hero here: I&#39;m down, Naya is getting shot up somewhere else, and then TB just casually walks forward, punches the Suvian, and knocks her out cold in one shot. Bam! Ptheh. Ew.&quot; The former soldier spat into his hand and held up a little white fragment to the light. &quot;Oh, look at that. Part of my old jaw bone got stuck in my teeth. Remind me to floss tonight, there might be more.&quot;</p>

The woman wore a long light blue sundress and sported round-rimmed sunglasses and a wide-brimmed hat. <br><br>&quot;Hello!&quot; she said cheerily, waving at Wobbles. &quot;Do you sell ice cream sandwiches here? If so, I&#39;ll take two: one for Harris and one for me.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I insist on paying, Sonia,&quot; said Harris, fishing his wallet out of his pocket. &quot;You&#39;ve been really nice to me lately and I feel that I should repay the favour...&quot;<br><br>Sonia smiled and brushed one of her pigtails out of her face. &quot;Such a gentleman.

            <p>Harris dumped the meager contents of his wallet into the palm of his hand and started sifting through assorted pieces of currency with a finger. &quot;Two euro...seven Danish kroner... a pure silver bullet--you can smelt that if you want-- and a HQ Armoury voucher for a bladed weapon of your choice. I think that should be enough, yeah?&quot; He handed the money to Wobbles and took the ice-cream sandwiches, handing one to Sonia. &quot;Thank you!&quot; he said as he and his companion departed. <br><br>&quot;I&#39;m not sure what brand of ice cream that she used, but this is definitely one of the better ones,&quot; said Harris between bites of his snack. &quot;What d&#39;you think, Sonia?&quot;<br><br>The former badfic character nibbled on her sandwich. &quot;I really like it! Well, that could be just me saying that because I&#39;ve only had ice cream two times in my life but... I could eat this stuff for days!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Oh, right. You lived in the <i>Fire Emblem</i> &#39;verse-- right. No ice cream there. I can&#39;t believe I forgot that.&quot;<br><br>Sonia shrugged. &quot;Eh, no big deal.

What did I do?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Hm? Oh, nothing wrong,&quot; said Sonia, taking him by the arm. &quot;Come on, let&#39;s go for a walk together. Maybe we might see some people we know.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Oh, like De Grasse over there,&quot; said Harris, pointing at his colleague some ways away. &quot;Looks like Tacitus is with him too. And over there...&quot; Harris grimaced. &quot;Looks like angel perv-boy and a giant squid woman. Uh... I think we should steer clear of that...&quot;<br><br>&quot;Agreed,&quot; said Sonia as she watched Stephanie press Backslash into her bosom. &quot;Who else is there?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Well, there&#39;s the two famous agents over there,&quot; continued Harris, pointing at Rina and Zeb, &quot;but I don&#39;t think they want to be disturbed.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Let&#39;s just keep on walking, then,&quot; said Sonia. &quot;Maybe we might bump into someone!&quot;<br></p>

Hanging six on the back of the Chinese dragon, the huge green <i>T. rex</i> opened its huge toothy maw and let out a thunderous roar that echoed across the coastline:<br><br><i>&quot;SURF&#39;S UP!!!&quot;</i><br><br>The tidal wave rose up to eight feet high before hitting the shore.

Volleyball, most likely. I will rather just observe your collective behavior, but I know a certain tyrannosaur who would be more than interested in cooperating.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Assuming my little arms aren&#39;t a problem, that is!&quot; Suta added, waving them and flashing a slightly mortified toothy smile.<br><br>In the middle distance, Rashida looked at the two of them and shook her head.

            <p>...was designed more for strutting around the beach than it was for swimming in. Not that Alloy had any particular desire to swim; Ginger had attempted to drag her into the water earlier, and Alloy was still cringing from the feeling of the wet paper sticking to her skull. Ginger had mostly ignored her after that -- the former Hermione replacement was checking her makeup in a tiny pocket mirror while she lay on a towel a few feet away.<br><br>The swimsuit in question was pink, with faux-lace hanging off of it. It was also about a size too small, but that was Ginger for you. Alloy herself was wearing the first thing she&#39;d found -- a black one-piece swimsuit. <br><br>Ginger finally snapped the mirror closed. &quot;Hey, &#39;Loy -- d&#39;you have that book?&quot;<br><br>Alloy clung to her copy of <i>Men at Arms</i>. &quot;Yes, and I am reading it.&quot;<br><br>Ginger sighed and shook her head, sending carefully arranged hair flying back into disarray. &quot;Look, it&#39;s cruel to lend me your books without letting me read the sequels!&quot; She attempted to smooth her hair back down, only to find that the red curls would have none of it. &quot;Ugh, whatever. I&#39;d say that the Sue who gave me this hair needs to die, but she already did. Now tell me what happens with the gonne.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Gonne?&quot; Alloy asked. Her eyes widened. &quot;Ginger! <i>Spoilers!</i> You have been reading my books while I was asleep, have you not?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Maybe,&quot; Ginger muttered. &quot;Besides, I thought you were a fast reader.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I am, when I have my glasses. You know, the ones you broke?&quot;<br><br>&quot;That was an accident! Just hold the book closer!&quot;<br><br>&quot;I am not nearsighted, you know! Just bad-sighted.&quot; <br><br>Ginger pushed herself upwards. &quot;Yeah, fine, I know. I&#39;m gonna go see if there&#39;s one of those dingy little snack shops around. You want anything?&quot;<br><br>&quot;No thank you, Ginger.&quot; Alloy flipped her book back open and squinted at the text.<br><br>((Yes, Ginger&#39;s swimsuit is a real swimsuit. It was just as appalling in person.))<br></p>

            <p>They&#39;d just returned from a little, uh, private sojourn in a more isolated stretch of the coast.

The Super had suggested to bury the two of them in the sand, to which the fitness trainer had agreed, and it was safe to say that things had escalated from there.<br><br>Cupid was still doing a little jig upon the hot sand, his oversized bare feet feeling especially tender. Backslash had at least put his summer shoes on (his only other clothing being his swimsuit and scarf), but Sarah had temporarily confiscated the angel&#39;s sandals, and was now watching her poor hopping partner in amusement.<br><br>&quot;Ooh, ow!

Really, with feet as cute as yours, how could I resist?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yeah, well, can we not repeat that here? There are <i>people</i> in the area,&quot; Backslash chimed in.<br><br>&quot;Yeah, I suppose our antics would probably be distracting for some,&quot; added Whitney, glancing at a bushy-haired young woman with a pink frilly swimsuit and her oddly papery partner lounging in the middle distance.<br><br>&quot;Yeah, but still, nothing like a little fun in the sun every once in a while, right?&quot; asked Cupid. &quot;All that&#39;s needed now is a piсa colada! Or the Greek equivalent, anyway.&quot;<br><br>They stopped under the shade of several palm trees, and the two assassins decided to rest under them.<br><br>&quot;Suit yourself,&quot; said Backslash, before chuckling grimly. &quot;The rest of us aren&#39;t alcoholic. I mean, I&#39;d like to take a shot or two, but Whitney would probably put me in traction.&quot;<br><br>The fitness trainer laughed and patted his shoulder. &quot;Why would I hurt my own student? I don&#39;t see a reason to do so... yet.&quot; She knocked twice on the palm tree as she said this.<br><br>Backslash gave his mentor a Not Amused look, while the two other teens erupted into laughter.</p>

            <p>A tall, obviously Elven woman strode out of a portal. As is usual for most Elves, her face had high cheekbones, an aquiline nose, a pointed chin and thin eyebrows that seemed perfectly shaped for being raised. Unlike most other Elves, though, her sclerae were red, her irises were black and her skin was ash-grey, clearly marking her as a <a href="http://elderscrolls.wikia.com/wiki/Dunmer_(Skyrim)">Dunmer</a>. Surprisingly for a scion of a fantasy ‘verse, she wore a black longcoat that wouldn’t have stood out in the grimiest post-Cyberpunk continuum; her bare feet peeked from under its ankle-length hem.<br>Turning on the spot, she walked around, seemingly at random, until she stopped about a metre away from Stephanie and Chakkik. She took her coat off, gently spreading it on the sand and lying down on it. Underneath it she wore a bikini.<br>“You! Yes, you in the leather armour set! Can you please move aside? You are blocking the sun!”<br></p>

Perhaps he&#39;d have to say hello to Tacitus sometime. &quot;I do have a question, though.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yeah?&quot;<br><br>&quot;The other females seem to be dressed in a lot less than yourself.

            <p>...near the tree line, a blue-rimmed portal opened and let through two people: a young man with a backpack and a Zorua. The former hauled a beach chair and a plastic cooler behind him while the Pokйmon balanced a beach mat on its back and dragged a parasol in its teeth. In a few minutes&#39; worth of set up, the portal was closed, the parasol was deployed, the beach mat unfurled, the beach chair pointed towards the ocean and sat on by one Gaspard De Grasse, and the cooler used as a footrest. Gaspard was pouring the contents of a bottle of Nuka-Cola into a dog bowl for his companion. <br><br>&quot;Here you go, Tacitus,&quot; he said, placing the soft drink in front of the seated Pokйmon. &quot;One ice-cold Nuka-Cola, just as you like it. Thanks again for helping me secure that 24-hour leave.&quot;<br><br>Tacitus nodded curtly and immediately went to lapping his soft drink. The mute Zorua would&#39;ve scribbled something along the lines of &quot;thank you&quot; in the writing booklet it used to communicate but nothing, <i>nothing</i> came in between him and his Nuka-Cola. <br><br>The human agent smiled slightly and went back to staring at the shimmering waters, sipping occasionally at the Nuka-Cola bottle in the chair&#39;s cup holder. As much as he wanted to swim, he was too comfortable to move. Opportunities like being able to sit still and relax somewhere nice were far and few between in the PPC-- might as well take advantage of them. Besides, under his hat, sunglasses, green t-shirt, and blue board shorts we was wearing enough sunscreen to block out gamma radiation; going for a swim would mean having to reapply all of that sunscreen again. <br><br>Gaspard pulled out a copy of <i>Persepolis</i> from his backpack and began to read. He was far enough from the others that he couldn&#39;t hear them. Tranquility at last.</p>

            <p>Aaron too had wandered away from the main area of the beach, though more out of a desire to explore than anything else.  As he approach Gaspard&#39;s beach chair, the familiar Nuka-Cola bottle caught his eye.  &quot;You&#39;re not from the Fallout continuum, are you?&quot; he asked hopefully.</p>

When everything calmed down, Valon and Kala could hear two individuals arguing.<br><br>&quot;Don&#39;t you dare hide under that hoodie all the time, old man,&quot; a cheerful female voice said. &quot;It&#39;s time to catch some bronze for the ladies!&quot;<br><br>&quot;I agreed to teleport you to the beach,&quot; another voice, this time belonging to a man, replied, &quot;I can patiently wait untill you&#39;re done playing and then we&#39;ll get back. Besides, this colour works too.&quot;<br><br>Two people have enter the beach: one was a young slender woman with shoulder-length black hair, and blue eyes hidden behind glasses, wearing a Hawaiian shirt over a black bikini. She was definitely the one having more fun. Following her was a taller man carrying a picnic basket ana a parasol. He, on the other hand, was fully clothed, with jeans, shoes and a grey hoodie over his head.<br><br>&quot;Come on,&quot; the girl encouraged him, &quot;do it. I dare you.&quot;<br><br>The man only dropped their equipment and sighed. &quot;You won&#39;t stop, will you?&quot;<br><br>After the girl shook her head, the man decided to finally remove his clothes, leaving only black swimming with a nautical star pattern. Now his messy, dark red hair, green eyes, and a small, pointy goatee could be seen. The biggest surprise was that his skin was pale. But not just simply pale. The man literally was paper-white. Even more, if that&#39;s possible. His companion covered his mouth, trying to contain laughter, before finally falling on the sand and rolling around, clutching her stomach.<br><br>&quot;Hahaha! I-I can&#39;t...&quot; she wheezed, trying to regain her breathing. It made the man fluster, which gave even more comical effect.<br><br>&quot;It&#39;s not <i>that</i> bad,&quot; he said, but the girl had another opinion, still laughing loudly.<br><br>&quot;It&#39;s so shiny! Hahaha!&quot; She started punching the sand, spreading it a little around her. &quot;The beacon of Minas Tirith! Hahahaha~! Gondor calls for aid!&quot;<br><br>&quot;I&#39;ll murder you, reanimate you, then murder again,&quot; the man grumbled, as he started setting up their place at the beach.<br><br>((I&#39;ve decided to give a little description, since their profiles are still in the making.))</p>

            <p>So I just finished designing my agent, who, while from world 1, where&#39;s clothing similar to the suit used by Kamen Rider Wizard, and to keep in thing, I was wondering if I was able to give him the ability to use the spell &quot;Connect,&quot; a spell used to grab objects from another location, as a form of mass storage. Please note to those that did their research that the character does not have a phantom inside him and that the his belt, which harbours his flash patch, would be used to activate the spell. Think of it as A one trick muggle use wand, if that makes any sense.</p>

            <p>D&amp;Dverse bags of holding, Harry Potter bigger-on-the-inside storage, even Mary Poppins bags--agents carry them; they&#39;re useful. Technically, you can even use a plot hole itself for storage, but I imagine DoSAT would have to stabilize one similarly to the ones used for transportation, so you could actually rely on using it for storage rather than randomly opening up into the girls&#39; locker room or something else equally embarrassing.<br><br>If there&#39;s a canonical way to activate such an effect without being a magic-user proper, go for it. If you can write a backstory about such an effect having been created by badfic, ditto.<br><br>Otherwise, I would go for a garden-variety bag of holding, perhaps created by a DoSAT employee mucking about with the &quot;Connect&quot; spell effect.</p>

            <p>I think your question is mainly related to whether this is OP for an agent? Well, first of all is the useful rule of thumb that goes, &#39;if you have to ask whether it&#39;s OP or not, it probably is&#39;. Second, you might want to look at <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=280433;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">this thread</a>, which deals with a similar subject (how to figure whether a Sue is OP or not).<br><br>On a different note, please touch up your SPaG.

            <p>So, going off of the XCOM example, if my character was able to use the Connect spell, it would be considered op, as it works similar to a portal from portal, only without a flat surface being required. Besides pulling a Rapier out of a hammer space mounted chest pocket seems way more comedic..<br><br>Also I&#39;m on a mobile device right now so autocorrect has been doing its rounds on me.</p>

            <p>OK just as a starting point, posting an image with a racial slur in it? Generally not cool. Even if you do mark it as NSFW, it&#39;d be helpful to specify why if you post it at all.<br><br>Secondly, it doesn&#39;t seem like you actually read Des&#39; post. He linked to that thread because it talks about OP-ness and what is and isn&#39;t acceptable. Your post about Connect and XCOM does not logically follow what Des said, and your bringing it back to Touhou follows even less.<br><br></p>

            <p>It&#39;s nice that she was amused, rather than hurt - this is why we Steve for humor over bashing! That&#39;s awesome, dude. Because I write infrastructure rather than missions, I&#39;ve never had anything like this - but I did once have someone write to me a few years after I&#39;d left them a very detailed review of everything wrong with their story (I know, I know - on the one hand, jerk move- on the other hand, she was a teenaged assassin with kills in the thousands, who outmaneuvered George Cooper and Alanna of Trebond at their peak… and I was young and hotheaded). She told me she&#39;d been pissed for a while, but after some time looked back and realized she really had let that story get away from her, and she wanted to improve it. <br><br>I do believe, though, this may be the first time I&#39;ve seen an author respond to a mission based on their fic with good humor <i>and</i> an edit. That&#39;s awesome! Good for her - and you. <br><br>Good times!</p>

            <p>So yeah, I randomly got this idea for an RP into my head, I mentioned it to a few people, and they all seem to like it!<br><br>So yeah. Basic premise: A whole bunch of PPC agents pop out to one of those gorgeous, pristine beaches that you see in any given anime. The one I had in mind was the one from Gurren Lagann; after all, once the cast moves on, it&#39;s likely that no one ever returns there through the entire story. Thus, it&#39;s a huge expanse of sand and water that&#39;s perfect for PPC agents.<br><br>Note: <i><b>This RP is an AU, and thus non-canon.</b></i> There&#39;s no way in all nine layers of hell the Flowers would give this many agents a day off at the same time, so whatever happens here has no effect on overall PPC canon.<br><br>And, well, since it&#39;s a beach episode, feel free to be as fanservicey (or fan disservicey) as you please with, say, swimsuit descriptions.<br><br>As for which agents I&#39;m bringing in? That would be my DF team (Valon and Kala) and my DMS team (Chakkik and Stephanie).<br><br>Who&#39;s up for a non-canon trip to the beach?</p>

            <p>So... yeah, I don&#39;t know if I should do this, but this thing deserves ALL the attention!<br><br>I give you - <a href="http://www.konradokonski.com/SITM/comic/title-0001/">Stick In the Mud</a> - a webcomic about a bar, friendship, drugs, and being a prick to others. It&#39;s made by a Polish artist, and originally named &quot;Kij w Dupie&quot; (<i>Stick Up the Arse</i>, named after an expression of a very prude and not-funny person.), currently being created simultanously in Polish and English. Summary says as follows:<br><br><i>The comic tells the story of Rod - kind-of-thirty-year-old who, as a result of amusing series of circumstances (including: losing the love of his life, and drinking moonshine bought online), becomes an owner of a ruined bar, frequently visited by unique patrons.<br><br>The comic is a mixture of comedy, absurd and an amateur improv theatre.</i><br><br>I won&#39;t give away too much, check it out if you want. I find it hilarious and am eagerly waiting for updates every Monday, Wednesday and Friday.<br></p>

            <p>But yeah, I plan on hosting another Gathering down my way - but with more things to do. See, what my plan NOW involves is going around Thanet and seeing the sights. They&#39;re there, I promise. Start in Dreamland, go through Margate, get the Loop bus route around Thanet, and go back home again. I don&#39;t know for certain what&#39;s happening with Dreamland during the winter period, but I know most people on the Board of Directors want to keep it open then. God alone knows what will actually happen, but it&#39;s something to bear in mind. =]<br><br>Also, sorry for the slightly garbled nature of the OP; I... think this came from my phone.</p>

            <p>There&#39;s an interesting idea in it. A Harry without his saving-people thing is an interesting direction to take as long as it&#39;s done <i>well</i>. You really need to know how to do it, and you need to know a lot more about this than the author seems to. Take Chapter 2. In order to get the plot moving in the direction the author wants, Vernon and his family get shot by a disgruntled employee. <i><b>THIS DOES NOT HAPPEN IN BRITAIN</b></i>. And it <i>especially</i> does not happen in commuter-belt Surrey. The author is an American applying American values and stylistic tropes to a society which not only does not possess them, but finds them morally repugnant to the point of outright offensive.</p>

            <p>Way back in the dim and distant past of, like, 2009 or something (according to the site), Topless Robot did this thing called Fanfiction Friday, in which a bloke called Rob dredged through the Internet&#39;s river of boiling, pus-spattered excrement to find the very worst that fanfic had to offer.

            <p>In a universe where it is theoretically possible for the weakest to defeat the strongest (Like Touhou), how do you exactly find out if someone is overpowered? what some people that i saw use for comparison is if they could defeat characters like Reimu or Yukari, when it&#39;s completely  possible for that to happen through Spellcard Rules.<br>this question has been bugging me for quite a while</p>

            <p>Let&#39;s use X-com as our example canon, Enemy Unknown, of course. If there was a hypothetical fic where the sue in question is a squad member, I would look largely at ease of success. In X-com, tactics are everything. Good tactics can let a recruit (Accuracy of a Stormtrooper + life expectancy of a redshirt) wipe out a squad of mutons (quarter-ton slabs of bulletproof muscle), as long as you&#39;re very lucky, and very clever about fighting them.<br><br>However, if the sue just walks out into the open, guns down three mutons, and then destroys a sectopod (Huge, well-armed brick powered by pure spite) without even getting close to dead, that is a pretty clear-cut example of someone being overpowered. So, what about a more ambiguous example?<br><br>If the sue in question does the same thing, but is not a recruit, and has at least mid-game equipment? A bit more reasonable, as I have had my own soldiers do even more insane things before. The moral of the story?<br><br>If the sue in question does everything to stack the deck in their favour, and gathers intelligence, fights like a massive cheap-shot and gets lucky? Well, then it might not be a sue we&#39;re dealing with, but rather, a perfectly reasonable character given the circumstances. In that case, the over-poweredness might be intellectual, rather than physical. After all, bringing a gun to a sword fight will ensure your victory, but you&#39;d need to know it WAS a sword fight, or something similar enough, ahead of time to prepare.<br><br>In short: If they fight like Superman while still being weak, than it&#39;s a sue. If they fight like Batman, it&#39;s a bit more reasonable, but you should always be on the lookout for Mary Tzu type characters.</p>

            <p>And he was certainly a very weak character defeating a very strong one.<br><br>Oh, yes, he had help. Sam, plus a couple of armies. But in the end, it was a couple of hobbits versus Sauron, and the hobbits won, mostly because Frodo was too compassionate to kill Gollum when he had the chance.<br><br>So here&#39;s your benchmark. Yeah, Frodo can defeat Sauron, but he had better try pretty hard doing it, or think hard, or face obstacles that matter. The world has to stay consistent.<br><br>Being overpowered, by itself, isn&#39;t the fundamental problem. Being able to easily overcome obstacles is the real Sue trait. It&#39;s often done by giving a favored character unrealistically strong abilities, to the point of Godmode!Sue, but some Sues weaken the characters around them, making them incompetent, instead of making themselves stronger. Others simply take over doing all the important things, even when it&#39;s a canon character&#39;s specialty.<br><br>It&#39;s possible to write a character with extreme powers, in a world where no one can match them, and still write a good story. The conflict simply has to come from another angle.<br><br>If you&#39;re looking for &quot;overpowered&quot;, I think the best way is to ask yourself, &quot;Are these characters facing obstacles that have, in one way or another, been made so trivial that there&#39;s no challenge? Are the obstacles merely there to make them look good?&quot;</p>

            <p>Dunno. <sup>_<sup><br><br>All</sup></sup> right, all right, I&#39;ll check.<br><br>According to Christopher Tolkien, the text that gave rise to Appendix A included a statement that they have few children, so many as four being rare, and that, quoting the Professor:<br><br><i>To these they are devoted, often rather fiercely: that is, they may treat them with apparent harshness... but they defend them with all their power, and resent injuries to them even more than to themselves.</i><br><br>The picture we&#39;re given is of a people wherein roughly two-thirds are able to reproduce (ie, 1/3 drop out due to being unattached males - the unmarried women I&#39;m neglecting for mathematical simplicity). If they average three children, then you&#39;re still getting 1 child back for each member of their parents&#39; generation. That produces a fairly static population count.<br><br>It&#39;s actually quite likely that the <i>number of children</i> is heavily ritualised. They certainly have rituals regarding <i>when</i> to have them: virtually every firstborn we have record of is 100 years younger than his father, and every <i>second</i> born is 110 years after his father. (Thorin is actually an exception to this; his younger brother was born only five years after him.) Tolkien even states this explicitly, stating: <i>[Women] are seldom seen in genealogies. They join their husbands&#39; families. But if a son is seen to be 110 or so years younger than his father, this usually indicates an elder daughter.</i><br><br>The more I read about them, the more I realise that dwarves were deeply into (non-religious) ritual. They all marry at the same age, have their children at the same age. They&#39;ll follow their kings into virtually anything. Their women stay at home, quite possibly voluntarily. They speak a language which hasn&#39;t changed since their species was created. They carry racial grudges as deep as chasms.<br><br>All of which says that the ones who buck the trend - Gimli Elf-friend, those women who don&#39;t marry - must be very strong personalities indeed.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>So of course they wouldn&#39;t have a swarm of little dwarves running around; they&#39;d have children at regular intervals for a relatively long time. That makes more sense to me.<br><br>An average of three children per family would still be a bit low because of the unmarried females, of which there are enough for it to be remarked on. So, maybe four or five per family, one every ten years for fifty years...<br><br>That dwarven females usually stay at home doesn&#39;t necessarily mean they don&#39;t have exciting lives, though. Not when your home is the entire inside of a mountain. For a dwarf, staying at home is probably the equivalent of our &quot;never going to a foreign country&quot;. I wonder how much of that famous dwarven craftsmanship comes from the women.</p>

            <p>Is a totally unrelated story, except that they both have in common the issue of population. The Giver quartet is finally finished, with the last book, &quot;Son&quot;, recently out and giving us an interesting look into the life of a Birthmother.<br><br>It&#39;s with the population numbers that I&#39;ve been intrigued, since there seems to be a stable canonical plot hole there:<br><br>--Each year, fifty children are born from birthmothers. These are usually single pregnancies, and twins are unusual enough to be remarked on.<br>--Each family is assigned two children, never three.<br>--Not everyone is assigned a spouse, and only couples can raise children.<br>--Each birthmother has only three pregnancies, after which she goes into a manual labor job.<br><br>It&#39;s never directly stated, but this does imply that two-thirds of females become birthmothers. The bigger plot hole is this: Not everyone is assigned a spouse, and families are allowed only two children each. That means that for each generation there are fewer places for children. And yet the population stays constant.<br><br>The author has admitted that she knows about the problem, but had gotten the book published before she realized it. So the plot hole had to stay, and be author-acknowledged too. Now I&#39;m just curious what happens when a plot hole is canon.</p>

            <p>So, as you guys may or may not be aware, I moved across the country last month. This, however, has presented me with a problem.<br><br>See, I really don&#39;t have a life. I have a compulsive need to talk to people, but with the move, things are starting to get a out of sync. The people I love talking to (SkarmorySilver, Iximaz, Darkotas) all go to bed three hours before I even start to feel tired.<br><br>The only PPCer that I know lives in the same time zone is doctorlit, and that&#39;s because he lives in the same <i>state</i>.<br><br>So yeah!

            <p>I am currently working on a crossover fanfic that involves <i>Pokйmon</i> and <i>Bakugan: Battle Brawlers</i>, more specifically the <i>New Vestroia</i> season. I am currently at the tail end of rewriting my previously-published chapters (a prologue and thirteen chapters of the rewrite have been published on both <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11164339/1/The-Vexos-Chronicles-Part-I-Lost-Luster">FFN</a> and <a href="http://son-of-heaven176.deviantart.com/gallery/53887706/The-Vexos-Chronicles-Part-I-Lost-Luster">DeviantArt</a>, and three chapters are left before the rewriting phase is over) and once I iron out Chapter 17, I&#39;ll have new chapters ready to go.<br><br>I was working with two betas, but it seems that one of them has disappeared. As my other beta and I ofttimes need the input of a third person at certain impasses, I am now looking for a new person to join our team and help with the remnants of this rewrite and beyond.<br><br>Given the size of the <i>Bakugan</i> fandom, I will not be requiring that you come in with knowledge of <i>Bakugan</i> (though being a Bakugan fan would definitely be a big plus); I only ask that you be willing to learn a new canon: I&#39;ll be sure to point you to any relevant background information that you might need.<br><br>However, knowledge of <i>Pokйmon</i> (up to at least Generation IV (Diamond/Pearl/Platinum)) is required: animeverse is preferred, but gamesverse will work as well.<br><br>Furthermore, I would like to have someone who can help in terms of pacing (i.e., whether a story is lagging or going too fast).<br><br>I work off of GDocs, but if needs be, I can send you a Word document.</p>

            <p>Well, I&#39;m with doctorlit on this—I&#39;d really rather not, if we can possibly persuade you to let us keep it. To you, maybe it&#39;s just a really old work, but to us, it&#39;s possibly the first recorded instance of a semi-fic blip in PPC canon, and an instance of PPC agents coming across an Extra Ring of Power, quite the staple trope in LotR Suefic. It would be a real shame for us to lose that.<br><br>And, you know, nobody likes what they wrote ten years ago. That doesn&#39;t make it actually bad, though. In fact, I think it&#39;s pretty good, not to mention a strong example of a classic PPC mission. {= )<br><br>So, do you think we could keep it? Pretty please?<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Nah, this isn&#39;t mirroring RL. It&#39;s just that we decided to stick Dawn and Des in an interlude together (which became &quot;Happy Idiot Talking&quot;), and then discovered they were shippable. And then we decided to go for it, with some pretty fun writing results. So: strictly PPC-verse is the correct answer.<br><br>(As for your second question: it does apply to me--did, rather, I&#39;m now either above the draft age or about to be--but there&#39;s an option to get an exemption on basis of religious...observance probably isn&#39;t the word I want, but I can&#39;t think of a better one right now. I also don&#39;t currently live in Israel, and left before I was ten, but I forget if that factors in as well. Basically, I got the exemption, which then allows you to spend a year followed by visits of up to three months until you&#39;re over the age, and promptly spent eleven months there for my gap year post-high school. No regrets whatsoever. I learned a lot, I got to go back to a country I hadn&#39;t seen in years--Nariel&#39;s experience was mine, actually--and I even became a Boarder and got Permission while I was there. Over all? Best year. Well, heh, ignoring bouts of homesickness because I&#39;d never been away from home for so long before. Apart from that, though, it was *fantastic*.)<br><br>~DF</p>

            <p>I posted a thread a long time ago with various hooklines for a low-fantasy book I&#39;m still outlining, with the working title of <i>Shadow Heart</i>. My main problem, according to Iximax (thanks for telling me of this, Ixi!), was that the hooklines I showed did not give any mention of the actual storyline. So, I redid and redid and redid them some more and came up with a few new ones. Out of the feedback you give me, I just want to know only these few things:<br><br>Does it give a snippet of storyline?<br>Are there clear stakes in store?<br>Is it tangible (in other words, could you imagine the consequences?)?<br>Does it interest you? (If it doesn&#39;t, that&#39;s fine. Not all genres appeal to all people. This is an optional question.)<br><br>So, here are some new premises:<br><br>&quot;After being unfairly accused and exiled, a swordsman seeks for answers in a troubled country.&quot;<br><br>&quot;An exiled swordsman seeks revenge against a monarch and peace for his own heart in an unstable country.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Exiled from a capital governed by the best fighter in the land, a swordsman finds that things aren&#39;t as stable as he believed them to be.&quot;</p>

            <p>while the current method of stealth utilized by agents are effective, i want to know if any there are other, more effective methods. While there are some, they&#39;re few and far between, though I do find the Amnesia Effect from Gatchaman Crowds an effective stealth.

            <p>The Inquisitors know all the secrets of the Imperium, and some even know basic Demon lore. (To better slay them, of course.) They can stomp around anywhere they wish, with absolutely nobody able to question them. Even the Sue would not be able to get the canons to turn against them: not without putting the Sue&#39;s resident planet under threat of Exterminatus. Then, all the Agents have to do is brand the Sue with HERESY!<br><br><img src="http://1d4chan.org/images/8/83/HeresyStamp.png" alt="http://1d4chan.org/images/8/83/HeresyStamp.png"> <br><br>Then, there is not a soul in the Imperium who would dare stop the agents from slaying the Sue. If they do, they are clearly heretics too, and must be slain, in the Emperor&#39;s name. We can even have a PPC branch hidden in the canon, so we can have our Spies looking around in broad daylight too. We either join the Ordo Hereticus, or make up something, like the Ordo Canonicus. It fits, and there is always a chance for a small group of Inquisitors that nobody has heard of yet.<br><br>The challenge is telling when a character in 40k is a Sue, or just a Space Marine. And not getting slaughtered in the vast, vast ways the canon wants to kill you. It would probably be the first actively hostile canon, as it seems to have a taste for canon Sues. If anyone has played Dark Heresy... They know how hard it can be even for Inquisition to live to see the next day.</p>

            <p>... she discussed the idea of a <a href="http://ppchistory.webs.com/AvonRift.htm">Department of Mary-Sues, Avon District</a>. In the unlikely event that one of you decides to play with the notion of resident PPC agents, I propose &#39;xx District&#39; as the naming structure.

            <p>And it would not be <i>that</i> much of a structure change. We already have All-Purpose, don&#39;t we? Agents that specialize in everything about one canon? All we would have to do is have it be proposed that the agents operate within the canon directly, rather then HQ. The list of people who would want to operate in multiple canons, or have to, would still work out of HQ. And seeing how many people write for All Purpose as is, the PPC as a whole would look very similar.<br><br>I think internally, the departments would be called Districts, but would have a code-name within the canon. So, to continue the Inquisition example, within the PPC they would be known as the Imperium District, but to themselves and canon bit characters, they are the Ordo Canonicus. After all, part of thee point is integration. How can they be truly integrated, if they have a massive SEP field over everything involving it?</p>

            <p>I was listening to the Bullet For My Valentine song &#39;Pretty On The Outside&#39; and came up with a really cool, but really out there idea.<br>The thing is, I was thinking on writing a story where one of the main characters is a Mary Sue.<br><br>Yes, you read that right. A main character is a Mary Sue. Now the other main character grows interested in her (like most character do around a Mary Sue) and gets closer to her. Once he&#39;s close he realizes she has no personality and is just there to pander to the crowds. He knows there&#39;s something more and so he digs deeper into her. She warns him not to but he continues his quest.<br>And this is where the song comes in. To try and stop him she starts messing with his head and heart whenever she can, which kind of breaks her &#39;perfect&#39; appearance.<br><br>How does this sound? Does it sound workable and would any of you guys read it?<br><br>(I know one of you guys will steal this idea, which I will flame you for, but if you do at least make it decent and not just there because you read this.

            <p>I didn&#39;t really get a feel for the proposed plot beyond &quot;boy meets Sue, likes Sue, finds out Sue, gets gaslighted by Sue.&quot;<br><br>It sounds like a pretty creepy idea, which is good if you want creepy -- but if this is a parody, it would turn it into dark humor pretty quick, and dark humor is hard to pull off.

            <p>Because I do! All those subtle, or not-so-subtle, hints and nods to another titles and works.

They were eating raw shanks of lamb and arguing about who would win in a fight: Dumbledore from Harry Potter books, or Magnus Bane.<br>&quot;Dumbledore would totally win,&quot; said the first one. &quot;He has the badass Killing Curse.&quot;<br>The second lycanthrope made a trenchant point. &quot;But Dumbledore isn&#39;t real.&quot;<br>&quot;I don&#39;t think Magnus Bane is real either,&quot; scoffed the first. &quot;Have you ever met him?&quot;</i><br><br>To avoid confusion, Magnus Bane is a character from the series...<br><br>Before this scene I&#39;ve enjoyed The Mortal Instruments. Now, I love it!<br><br>What about you guys? Any references you&#39;ve discovered that made you smile, laugh, or anything? I can&#39;t be the only one! :D</p>

            <p>Here are some of my favorites:<br><br>-In the scene from &quot;Breaker of Chains&quot; (Game of Thrones season 4) where the Meereeneese champion challenges Daenerys, one of his lines is <a href="http://www.themarysue.com/game-of-thrones-monty-python/">apparently</a> a Low Valyrian translation of a certain immortal Monty Python line. I&#39;m not sure if this is in A Feast for Crows, too, but now I want to reread it and find out. :)<br><br>-Speaking of Game of Thrones, there&#39;s a subtle reference to it in Pokemon Gold/Silver/Crystal/HeartGold/SoulSilver; a trainer on Route 42 is called Fisherman <i>Tully.</i><br>--Other good ones from the Pokemon series include the Hiker in Rock Tunnel who literally says &quot;Hit me with your best shot&quot; before battle (and &quot;Fired away!&quot; when he loses) and Silver quoting Ledger!Joker in HGSS.<br><br>-Listen to K.K. Adventure in Animal Crossing. Then listen to the Pirates of the Caribbean theme. <br>--K.K. Island is also a remix of the island theme from the Gamecube game, and Rockin&#39; K.K. is based on the Hippie battle theme from EarthBound and/or Chuck Berry&#39;s &quot;Johnny B. Goode&quot;.<br>--Quillson the duck villager is probably based on Brian Wilson of the Beach Boys.</p>

            <p>You might want to look at <a href="http://fanlore.org/wiki/Mortal_Instruments_(Harry_Potter_story)">this</a>. I find it rather interesting she named her &#39;original&#39; series after her Ron/Ginny fic, especially her very heavy usage of incestuous themes in TMI... <s>oddly appropriate acronym, no?</s><br><br>Also, I know I&#39;m not the only one who&#39;s pointed this out, but the fact that most, if not all, of the <i>Mortal Instruments</i> characters are almost direct expies of the <i>Harry Potter</i> characters really turned me off from the series. Jace is the most egregious example, being almost identical in look and character to Draco Malfoy and Clary being a Sued-up Ginny, Alec being Harry, Lucian being Remus, Valentine being a Voldemort/Lucius mashup, and Isabelle being her Draco Trilogy&#39;s Blaise Zabini.<br><br>Also, fun fact, you know that story Jace told Clary about the falcon? Taken almost word-for-word from the Draco Trilogy. Now, <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/fifty-shades-of-grey-started-out-as-twilight-fan-fiction-2015-2">where have we heard of something like this before...?</a></p>

            <p>I don&#39;t know much about <i>Red Dwarf</i>—in fact, I think the first episode is all I&#39;ve actually seen—but it&#39;s always seemed like something I SHOULD like, so it&#39;s nice to see it in a mission. {= )<br><br>Technical notes first, because that&#39;s how my brain operates:<br><br>Somehow, your four betas appear to have missed a number of incorrect periods in dialogue. Basically, any time you&#39;ve got dialogue in the formula of &quot;Words words words,&quot; verbed Character (or Character verbed), you need a comma at the end of the speech, not a period. The first one of these in the mission is this:<br><br> “Looks like you’ve lost a bit of weight recently, like, in the last few seconds.” Amelia said 
<br>There are also assorted comma issues throughout, but I don&#39;t really want to make a list of them here. I could take a crack at the doc in Suggestion mode if you like, though. I&#39;ve got some free time coming up this weekend.<br><br>Regarding the actual content of the mission, I liked it! I like how you set up the things that happen to Skeet ahead of time, like with the CAD cartridge (interesting idea, btw) and the sleeping bag. I&#39;d think that knowing what&#39;s going to happen would make it less funny, but actually the suspense of waiting for it to happen makes it work for me.<br><br>I also really like what you did with Amy at the end. It&#39;s always interesting to see assassins having moral qualms about what they&#39;re doing. I look forward to seeing how this plays out for her in future stories.<br><br>The agents&#39; interactions in general are good, too. It&#39;s clear they&#39;re still getting to know each other and aren&#39;t quite sure how to behave, especially Amy when she was all happy that she&#39;d been helpful and then found out otherwise. Ouch.<br><br>So, all in all, nice work, and it&#39;s good to have you back. {= )<br><br>Oh, and about creating a wiki page—I&#39;d say go for it. I want to say I&#39;ve seen at least one other <i>Red Dwarf</i> mission, though I could be wrong, and I know Agent Milask is either from that continuum or at least heavily based on the Cat. It doesn&#39;t have to be a huge page, just enough to give the basic idea.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Out of interest, how easy did you find the mission to follow? This was partly an experiment to see how well I could write a mission in a continuum that I&#39;m not expecting most people to be that familiar with.<br><br>I thoroughly recommend <i>Red Dwarf</i>, it&#39;s one of my favourite comedy shows. If you&#39;ve seen the first episode and enjoyed it then I think you&#39;ll like all the rest. Although I think that an American version was made, which did terribly - haven&#39;t seen it myself, but that&#39;s what I remember hearing. I&#39;m not sure if the episode you saw was from the British or American version, but I&#39;m recommending the British one :)<br><br>Yes, I remember being told about full stops at the end of dialogue before. Unfortunately that was so long ago that I&#39;d forgotten it when writing this. I&#39;m a little shaky on the technical side of writing dialogue, because all of my recent writing lessons have been about how to write technical reports - and there&#39;s surprising little dialogue in those. I think my brain just has a tendency to default to &#39;sentences end with full stops&#39;.<br><br>I&#39;ve sent you a link to the doc (you may have seen that already), so yeah I&#39;d appreciate any further comments you have. <br><br>I&#39;m glad you like the actual content and character interactions - the bits that you picked out are among my favourite little scenes from this mission. <br><br>Skeet and Amy are still getting to know each other (even if their first mission was a few years ago; in universe it&#39;s only meant to be a couple of days). I was hoping that would come across, and it sounds like I succeeded. <br><br>I&#39;ll start putting a <i>Red Dwarf</i> page together for the wiki <br><br>Thanks for all your comments.<br><br>- Irish<br></p>

            <p>Not with anything you&#39;ve said about me in the report, but just by writing it so quickly. I still haven&#39;t got round to writing up the Chicago Gathering from September last year. And how does one &quot;accidentally&quot; write a Gathering Report anyway? I suspect foul play of some sort. <br><br>Was that really the route we took? Yeah, that looks... less than optimal in terms of efficiency. However, it has given me a new goal: host a Gathering myself, and deliberately lead the group on a path that forms an amusing shape when viewed on a map (I&#39;m sure we can all guess what shape first sprang to mind*). Because, apparently, I&#39;m mature like that.<br><br>That shot you got of me at the door in Bree is a good one; I&#39;ve rarely looked so mischievous.<br><br>- Irish<br><br>*A giant smiley face, obviously </p>

            <p>I like to drink my black and oolong tea varieties without sugar.<br><br>Unless I&#39;m putting milk in. Then a little sugar brings out all the lovely complex flavors, especially if it&#39;s something like Earl Grey, whose citrusy floral notes would get buried under the dairy without a bit of sweetness to boost them. Any flavored black tea can benefit from sweetening, really. I typically use about half a teaspoon in my 12-oz mug. If it&#39;s spicy, though, like a chai, I use a full teaspoon. Chai is <i>supposed</i> to be sweet.<br><br>Of course, there&#39;s also the lemon-and-honey-and-maybe-whiskey route, which is excellent if you&#39;ve got a sore throat. I&#39;ve only done that with a robust black tea, like a breakfast blend. Wouldn&#39;t try it with, say, a Darjeeling.<br><br>I usually drink green teas straight, but if I feel like sweetener, only honey will do—these days, I like creamy honeys better than your standard amber honey. It can be really nice with your more astringent greens, like gunpowder or the historical Hyson tea I picked up in DC a couple years ago. Obviously not with genmaicha, though. That would be weird.<br><br>Then there&#39;s herbals, which I suppose you could discount as not actually tea if you&#39;re being a purist, but I will say that fruity teas (or infusions, if you like) <i>need</i> sugar. It&#39;s fruit, for crying out loud; and they tend to be rather acidic. Sweetness balances acid.<br><br>The trick, of course, is not to overdo it. You&#39;re adding sweetness to enhance the flavor of your tea; if you add so much that all you can taste is sugar, you&#39;re doing it wrong.<br><br>If you really want to get adventurous, try adding salt sometime. Salt interferes with bitter flavors, so if you accidentally oversteeped your brew, a tiny bit of salt will fix you up.<br><br>~Neshomeh, tea guru.</p>

            <p>First, I only decided to read this when I saw that you&#39;d added it to Za&#39;kiir&#39;s wiki page, and I could see what the fandom was and also what badfic it was.

But this may be just me, not knowing the prevalent metaphors and having read too much weird PPC stuff.

            <p>It&#39;s been a while since a certain Steel-type has written anything, hasn&#39;t it? Well, &#39;twas about time we fixed that. After a conversation between the two of us about how to make a certain dueling DMS pair of his more likeable, we decided to co-write a mission once again. Without further ado, we hope you enjoy reading it!<br><br><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NVpea3wGEADABweKz_C-Z_T18B_wFplMXAwXjEbk1RY/edit?usp=sharing">&quot;Attack On Badfic&quot;</a><br>Fandom: <i>Attack On Titan</i><br>Boarders/agents participating:<br>- SkarmorySilver: Rayner Blitzkrieg, Evangeline von Lilith<br>- Voyd: Valon Vance, Kala Jeng, Chakkik</p>

            <p>This was a pretty good mission, but (at the risk of sounding like a broken record) some advance warning that you&#39;re going to post would be greatly appreciated. One look-through just isn&#39;t enough to catch every possible error, and if I know that you&#39;re planning on posting soon, I&#39;d make sure to give it another look ASAP.<br><br>That said, this has been a good mission. Even though this mission juggled five Agents (gasp!), they did not get lost in the multitude of characters. And thanks loads for avoiding major spoilers for those of us who (like myself) only watch the anime.<br><br>As for the errors:<br>1) <i>Eren Yager got there first, bit down on her tail and pulled hard enough to send her into the floor.</i><br>Unless you&#39;re implying that E.V.L. phased through the floor, that should be &quot;<b>onto</b> the floor,&quot; not &quot;into.&quot;<br><br>2) <i>Whoa Nelly</i><br>You need a comma between these words.<br><br>3) <i>“Ohhh. </i>Heichou,<i> Captain… I get it now! First time I’ve seen fangirl Japanese make a mini.”</i><br>There is a bit of punctuation missing:<br><i>&quot;Ohhh. </i>Heichou<i><b><u>:</u></b> <b><u>&#39;</u></b>Captain<b><u>&#39;</u></b>… I get it now!&quot;</i><br><br>4) <i>Regenerate like a son of a b***h, single weak point on the back of their neck, I know these things, I’ve read the manga.</i><br>Replace that last comma with a period or a colon.<br><br>5) <i>from the Pathfinder continuum</i><br>Italicize &quot;Pathfinder,&quot; since it is the name of a continuum.<br><br>6) <i>Valon shuddered. “This… could be a problem. I’m acrophobic, meaning I’m pretty much earthbound for this entire mission—if you want me to be coherent, anyway. I’m not comfortable being more than my own height away from solid ground, and 3DMG gets a lot further than that.</i><br>You forgot to close the quotes.<br><br>7) <i>Wait… An accent over the e? How did the author do that?</i><br>I mentioned this during betaing, but apparently you missed it: There is no context to this. Where did the fic have an accented E?<br><br>8) <i>The Sue proceeded to explain how the parade had come to be, involved a lengthy description of the event and a tale of two lovers.</i><br>I understand what you meant, but the wording is just the tiniest bit awkward. There are three possible fixes:<br><br>a) <i>The Sue proceeded to explain how the parade had come to be, <b>which</b> involved a lengthy description of the event and a tale of two lovers.</i><br><br>b) <i>The Sue proceeded to explain how the parade had come to be <b>and included</b> a lengthy description of the event and a tale of two lovers.</i> (Note that there is NO comma.)<br><br>c) <i>The Sue proceeded to explain how the parade had come to be, <b>including</b> a lengthy description of the event and a tale of two lovers.</i><br><br>9) <i>Also, why the oral exchange of bodily fluids, I do not understand why mammals do that.</i><br>Please replace the comma with a semicolon or question mark.<br><br>10) <i>I can understand how surviving a Titan attack would give you A lot more self esteem, but...</i><br>&quot;Self-esteem&quot; is hypenated.<br><br>11) <i>Valon nodded in agreement, and paged the Department of Redundancy Department.</i><br>Am I missing something? Why did he page the DRD?<br><br>12) <i>“No no, not in front of me!”</i><br>Please put a comma between the two &quot;no&quot;s. And this is a stylistic suggestion, but please add a third &quot;no&quot;; it sounds more natural to my ears: &quot;No, no, no! Not in front of me!&quot;<br><br><br>13) <i>“No way, I’m not getting separated from Valon again.”</i><br>Please replace that comma with a semicolon.<br><br>14) <i>“Excuse me, I am an </i>arachnid<i>.”</i><br>Please replace the comma with a period or a semicolon.</p>

            <p><i>“Seid ihr das essen? Nein, wir sind der Jдger!”<br>“Are we the prey? No, we are the hunters!”</i><br>Actually, Valon said, &quot;Are you [plural] the eating? No, we are the hunter!&quot;<br><br>(1) <i>essen</i> may be a verb (&quot;to eat&quot;) or a noun (&quot;food&quot;); if used as a noun, it should be capitalized like every noun in German. Thus, <i>“Seid ihr das Essen?”</i> would translate to &quot;Are you the food?&quot;<br><br>(2) <i>Beute</i> would be a more accurate translation of &quot;prey&quot;. If Valon doesn’t actually mimic a dialogue, he should say <i>&quot;Sind wir die Beute? Nein, wir sind die Jдger! &quot;</i><br><br>(3) The singular and plural forms of <i>Jдger</i> (&quot;hunter&quot;/&quot;hunters&quot;) look similar, but <i>der</i> is the male singular article. With &quot;hunters&quot;, you should use the plural article <i>die</i>, which incidentally looks just like the female singular article.<br><br>Also:<br><br><i>... otherwise you’d have <b>at</b> a giant wall of text ...</i><br>I think either &quot;at&quot; should not be there, or some other words may be missing.<br><br>&quot;He beat the living <i>scheiЯe</i> out of Eren in the latter&#39;s court trial ... &quot;<br>Since <i>ScheiЯe</i> is a German noun, it should be capitalized.<br><br><i>Valon expression was one of alarm.</i><br>Shouldn’t this be &quot;Valon’s expression&quot;?<br><br>... leave their best <i>verdammt</i> weapon against the Titans to die ...<br>If you mean &quot;their damned best weapon&quot;, you should keep the word order: &quot; their <i>verdammt</i> best weapon &quot;.<br>If you mean &quot;their best damned weapon&quot; (assuming that being damned is an attribute of the weapon), the correct conjugation would be &quot;their best <i>verdammte</i> weapon&quot;, because a generic weapons grammatical gender is female (die verdammte Waffe).<br><br>HG</p>

            <p>Normally I hate reading missions set in a canon I don&#39;t know, but the agents did a good job of explaining exactly why the fic was so wrong for the canon.

            <p>And yeah, the need for backup was more or less the entire reason why we had five agents go through this mission. We were well aware of how hard it would be to organize their interaction as well, which is why we had the boys and the girls split up near the start.

            <p>The Sue did plagiarize the plot, but didn&#39;t pretend to be Madoka - she (an american tranfer student called Angie, apparently) just shoved her out of the way and had everything happen to herself instead.<br><br>And, well, it wasn&#39;t Madoka killing her but Homura, who&#39;s basically Madoka&#39;s protector in canon.</p>

            <p>The Discworld books are some of the most brilliant writing in existence, and if you haven&#39;t read them, it is your job, nay, your <i>duty</i> to cease whatever it is you are doing at the moment and go read them.  Immediately.<br><br>More seriously, though, they are very, very good, and I&#39;d especially recommend them to PPC members.  As Jay and Acacia mention in TOS, Discworld is one of the main inspirations for the PPC, if on more of a thematic and stylistic than literal level.</p>
