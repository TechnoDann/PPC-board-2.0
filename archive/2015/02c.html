            <p>He lived his own philosophy. He lived long, and he prospered.<br><br>While it is true that he&#39;s no longer with us, and that he touched all of us in his own unique way, and will never be replaced, I feel we should focus on the life he lived. On the fact that he touched us in so many unique ways - Whether as Spock, or in The Body Snatchers, or even cameos on the Simpsons, he brought us a bit of joy, sparked our imaginations, and allowed us to laugh. <br><br>Shatner said it best, I think. &quot;Of all the souls I have ever encountered, his was the most...human.&quot;<br><br>Rest in peace, Mr. Nimoy, and keep exploring the undiscovered country.

            <p>Ilraen looked up from his worktable at a strange sound from the direction of the console. His partner was sitting stock-still, staring at something on the screen.<br><br>&lt;Nume? What is it?&gt;<br><br>&quot;Nothing!&quot; he said, too quickly. The screen went blank. He rose and surreptitiously ran a hand across his face, then gave a sniff—the sound that had attracted Ilraen&#39;s attention.<br><br>Ilraen said nothing, but returned his main eyes to his work. His stalk-eyes roved over the room, carefully not focusing on Nume.<br><br>For a moment there was silence. Finally, Nume said, &quot;Leonard Simon Nimoy is dead.&quot;<br><br>&lt;Oh.&gt; Tentatively, he added, &lt;You admire him greatly, do you not?&gt;<br><br>&quot;Yes I do.&quot; A pause. &quot;Ilraen, did I ever play any of my Alien Voices collection for you?&quot;<br><br>&lt;I believe so. Not recently.&gt;<br><br>&quot;Well, the article doesn&#39;t mention his work on Alien Voices at all. It&#39;s ridiculous.&quot; He opened a cabinet above the console and started rifling through its contents. &quot;So, what do you say? <i>Journey to the Center of the Earth</i> or <i>The Time Machine</i>?&quot;<br><br>&lt;I do like him as Professor Lidenbrock.&gt; Ilraen did not add that this performance of Nimoy&#39;s reminded him of his partner.<br><br>&quot;Sure.&quot; Nume pulled out the CD and popped it into the console.<br><br>The two settled down to enjoy it.<br><br><hr>
<br>I used the <i>New York Times</i> <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/27/arts/television/leonard-nimoy-spock-of-star-trek-dies-at-83.html?_r=0">article on Mr. Nimoy&#39;s passing</a> as reference for this little tribute. <a href="http://alienvoices.net/">Alien Voices</a> is awesome. You can download the audio dramas in MP3 format for free, so check them out. {= )<br><br>~Neshomeh, very sad.</p>

            <p>(...Or whatever virtual equivalent I can&#39;t seem/am too lazy to come up with.)<br><br>So, I have been here in the PPC community for a bit over two years now in various states of activity (mostly lurking), and I have a question for all of you productive members of the community.<br><br>How do you motivate yourselves to write stories? I don&#39;t just mean getting started with an idea and writing out the first few paragraphs, which is something I&#39;ve recently just barely found the courage to do. I mean maintaining it long enough to complete stories that can go on for pages and then chapters. Where do you find the energy beyond that initial rush of excitement as an idea pops into your mind? For me that only lasts through the first two or three paragraphs of a story until I hit my first major roadblock. I get them down, set the stage then just stare at the white space for minutes without a clue of how to get beyond that. Then I simply lose all drive to write anymore and the story&#39;s left to collect dust in my notebook or some file deep in my hard drive. Sometimes I outright erase it.<br><br>This problem has been plaguing me since after I wrote my first (horrible) fanfic, then lost touch. I&#39;ve not been able to finish anything since. It&#39;s especially problematic now that I need to write two eight page stories for my creative writing class and I&#39;ve failed to go beyond the conceptual stage on either.<br><br>Can anyone help me understand and/or get past this?</p>

            <p>Seriously. I appreciate it. I&#39;ll try not writing so linearly and see how it helps.<br><br>So, at risk of sounding greedy, I have another question. As I said in my first post, I usually get stuck early on in writing and don&#39;t continue because I can&#39;t figure out where to go or how to get there. I understand that transitioning is a challenge a lot of writers face. How do you all handle this?</p>

            <p>I usually plan things out in excruciating detail well in advance, making multiple passes that slowly increase the level of detail (again, not in chronological order). <i>Palaven&#39;s Dogs</i> had gone from &quot;Council screws over turians&quot; to a list of missions to a detailed play-by-play of what each action sequence contains before there was ever anything resembling actual finished material.<br><br>I <i>have</i> found that writing sections in nonchronological order does make it more difficult to write the transitional sections of new material after a skip, so maybe that&#39;s what you&#39;re asking about. If so, I usually write down some indication of what happened in the section I skipped (especially what critical exposition and worldbuilding I got out of the way in it) and go with a relatively cold open on the new material, remembering that I can always go back and change the segues later in order to make them connect better.<br><br>If you&#39;re asking about actual scene transitions, I&#39;m afraid I can&#39;t help you much other than to say that they aren&#39;t 100% <i>necessary</i> in the first place. Nobody seems bothered when the scenes I write just <i>end</i> only to pick up somewhere else on the other side of a horizontal bar, and if the writing is fluid enough people won&#39;t notice small in-text skips either. There&#39;s one scene in particular in <i>PD</i> where Garrus and Shepard go from the inside of their ship to a loading dock with nothing but a paragraph break between the two sections, but it&#39;s not hard to fill in that they had a brief, boring walk to get there. I&#39;ve even included actual time-date-location stamps in the transitions before, but that&#39;s usually a sign the scene shifts have gone from &quot;minimalist&quot; to &quot;too cheap to describe the new environment properly&quot;.</p>

            <p>Sometimes I have a vague plan written (or at least mentally written) in advance. The most thorough example of this was <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9130619/1/The-Official-Fanfiction-University-of-Discworld">OFUDisc</a>, for which I had a list of classes, deaths, and resurrections for every single chapter. Mostly I don&#39;t go even that in-depth, but particularly for fanfic, knowing what each chapter will be is helpful.<br><br>Other times - and this is how I wrote all four of my <a href="http://nanowrimo.org/participants/huinesoron/novels">NaNos</a> - my strategy when I get stuck is &#39;throw something else at them&#39;. My first NaNo gained a major character purely because writing &#39;they got on the train; then they changed trains; then they got off&#39; was really tedious. She&#39;s been written right back out on the rewrites, but she made the original version work.<br><br>It&#39;s probably the most fun way to resolve that form of writer&#39;s block. Drop a natural disaster on your characters, or make something go disastrously wrong, or simply have one of them trip and break her leg. It might turn out to lead you into a dead end, or it might take you onto a path you like but by a route you later get rid of, but at least you&#39;ll be <i>writing words</i>.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>This is something I&#39;ve been trying to get past as well. I have ideas, I write it out a bit... But it never seems to be completely done or to my liking. For me, those bursts of writing energy seem to come very rarely - one day, I might have two paragraphs, while the next brings five pages, and finally nothing for a month or two. I&#39;m not a bad writer, I just lack motivation.<br><br>Here&#39;s my advice. As others have said, break it down into smaller chunks. I&#39;ve also found that it helps to start with small prompts, and then work your way up to larger things like missions. Write how your characters will react to a pre-prepared situation, then move up to your own ideas once you have more confidence and stamina for the larger projects. For your creative writing class, perhaps go through TVTropes for some ideas, then adapt the tropes to the situation. (I don&#39;t do a lot of creative writing though, so take anything I say with a grain of salt.)</p>

            <p>In addition to what Iximaz says about breaking it down into chunks and taking frequent breaks, I&#39;ve found that forcing yourself to write something contiguously start-to-finish is a terrible idea: when I don&#39;t feel like writing a certain segment, I skip it and move on to another. Usually I keep up a sort of rolling process where I write some new material, then go back and edit stuff I wrote a few chapters before, then repeat.<br><br>It also helps that with <i>Palaven&#39;s Dogs</i> I&#39;m actually somewhat emotionally invested in the characters and plot, and sort of want the closure the ending gives a few characters to &quot;happen&quot;.</p>

            <p>It really depends on the story; obviously, it&#39;s easier to write something that interests you. I&#39;m fairly lucky in that writing is my passion. I don&#39;t often hit that brick wall, but when I do, I hit it hard. Like right now, for instance. <i>Rose Potter</i> has come to a bit of a halt while I try to figure out what to do next.<br><br>Me, I take a break. Watch a movie, read a book, play some video games, write something else like silly nonsense, or just fall back on the time-honored tradition of taking a nap. You&#39;d be surprised how much good a break can do.<br><br>And if that fails and you&#39;re working on a deadline, look at what you have planned and try to divide it into chunks. &quot;I&#39;ll try to get X much done today&quot; is my mantra.<br><br>Hope this helps a bit! </p>

            <p>I know internet drama is not much of what the PPC is about, but this is important news for anybody who uses the internet.<br><br>Today, the FCC has voted 3-2 to maintain Net Neutrality laws. If you do not know what Net Neutrality is, basically, it mandates that ISPs cannot restrict data to or from websites, nor provde so-called &quot;fast lanes&quot; for premium prices. If you want to know more, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpbOEoRrHyU">Last Week Tonight</a> covered the issue, and explains both net neutrality and why it is important.<br><br>That said, cable companies and ISPs are <i>not</i> happy. Verizon has responded with, to be frank, the most delicious salt I have read in a long time.<br><br><a href="https://i.imgur.com/FBfGoiT.png">Here</a> is a image copy of Verison&#39;s webpage after the announcement. Notice how it is in Morse Code. Adorable. <br><br>If you don&#39;t want to slog through translating the thing into English, don&#39;t worry, <a href="http://publicpolicy.verizon.com/assets/docs/VZ_NR_--_2-26-15_VZ_Statement_on_Open_Internet_Order_FINAL_1.pdf">Verison translated for you.</a> I swear, I could use this thing as a replacement for vinegar, it&#39;s so bitter.<br><br>Even better news, the Republican party has stated that they will not introduce legislation to counteract this. They have even hinted at being open to some of Obama&#39;s plans for the internet, which includes making the internet a utility. Things seem to be changing on the interwebs. Things we should all keep an eye on.</p>

            <p>So today (or possibly tomorrow, I&#39;m a little hazy on the exact date) marks five years with the PPC. Seriously, how in the world did you lot put up with me for five years?<br><br>To be fair I&#39;ve had periods of inactivity so I dunno if you can actually count this as a proper five years with the PPC, be it&#39;s definitely been five years since I&#39;ve joined. Which is still weird to me. Seems like just a few months ago that I got Permission. Heck, it seems like just a few months since I started hanging around the IRC, back when it was actually active and full of people talking all day every day. In the five years since I&#39;ve joined, I&#39;ve made several friends, and lost a few. I&#39;ve been introduced to new fandoms and communities thanks to you guys, and had some of the most fun playing games and reading bad fanfic. I dunno that I&#39;ll still be here in another five years, but here&#39;s to however much longer I do end up spending.</p>

            <p>So, I like a lot of works of fiction. The list on my wiki page is very far from complete, and the list is bloody long as it is.<br><br>I also like creating characters. Sometimes, when I have nothing better to do, I&#39;ll start generating the flavor of a Pathfinder character. I&#39;ve also spontaneously thought up several PPC agents who will likely never see the light of day.<br><br>What that brings me to is this: how would YOU write non-human agents from some of the continua I like?<br><br>Note that you need not think of a character for every item on the list, since odds are good you won&#39;t know all of them. To save you guys searching, I&#39;ll drop some continua right here.<br><br>-Monster Musume: I know, one of my agents is from this continuum, but if you combine this with Kenkou Cross&#39;s original Monster Girl Encyclopedia, there is just tons of variety. I tried to follow Okayado&#39;s example, giving the monster girls many biological traits of the animals they resemble and also not making them not depend on naughty fun times. If you want to make a MonMusu character, expect to be doing a lot of zoology research.<br><br>-Pikmin: I love Pikmin, but it comes with a huge barrier for agents: very few creatures in the series are sapient, and also most are bug-sized. If you can figure a workaround for it, I&#39;d very much like to see a Pikmin agent.<br><br>-Prototype: This kinda goes in the opposite direction. The Evolved are significantly watered down compared to Alex and James, but I still feel that even with just one of Alex/James&#39;s powers, Evolved are unfortunately way too powerful to be used as agents. I could maybe accept an agent that was Evolved in his duties, but even that is iffy, since Alex Mercer personally creates Evolved, and he&#39;s so powerful that I worry about him having neuralysis immunity.<br><br>-Mega Man: This is one that would encourage creativity. Robot Masters, Mavericks and NetNavis are all incredibly varied, but we again run into the problem of the setting&#39;s rather high power level. X, Zero, MegaMan.EXE and Bass.EXE are near to robot/computer program gods, but they&#39;re just the elite members of already-OP races. There&#39;s also the conundrum of NetNavis not possessing physical bodies, being computer programs.<br><br>These are far from the only continua that I&#39;d be interested in seeing PPC reps for. Go forth, and brainstorm!</p>

            <p>Out of those continua, I&#39;m only familiar with MegaMan and maybe Pikmin. Like you said, those two series would be somewhat odd choices for agents due to the natures of the characters. I think there&#39;s a perfect place for them: the DoSAT. For example, NetNavis have been shown to be able to &quot;speak&quot; to technology, and a Pikmin character would be small enough to fit into the inner workings of devices. These factors would allow them to interact with technology in a way other agents never could, and thus they would be the perfect choices for maintaining agent gear.</p>

            <p>First, perhaps an RC of Action agents that includes a Navi would be equipped with an RA that doubles as a PET.<br><br>Second, there are continua where perhaps a Navi <i>would</i> have a body. Obviously, one would be Battle Network, but I also think they&#39;d physically exist in Digimon, dot.Hack, Sword Art Online, and the Matrix. All of these are at least partially based in a virtual, computer-based world, where a Navi could feasibly exist. Of course, one could possibly jack Dimensional Area generators from NT Warrior, but that may be a waste of resources.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m wondering if a Navi could potentially be used to disrupt the functions of Sues/Stus with bionic or mechanical parts as well. Get close, find a way to jack in, and watch as the Sue/Stu loses control. Perhaps this could work somewhere like a Transformers fic?</p>

            <p>I have an Agent idea that was inspired by a comment from Neshomeh, but since this character is kinda powerful, I decided to throw it to the Board-folks for review and, if necessary; correction or destruction. But first a little back-story.<br><br>This character was created for a <s>really bad</s> original <i>continuum</i> that I created at least ten years ago, probably more; that, in retrospective; was pretty much a ripoff of the DC Universe, but this character was special, because in a world of ripoffs, this one was the ultimate: This character was a 15-years old red-haired <i>literal</i> clone of the then Kara Zor-El/Supergirl! Other than that, the character had little personality or history (and full access to her <b>full Kryptonian powers, despite the fact she was<i> teen</i>  and a <i>clone</i> on top of that!</b>), and aside from the codenames <i>Kryptogirl</i> and <i>Project-K</i>, she had no true name. Eventually, I got fed-up with this Sue-<i>continuum</i>, and was retconned it into oblivion. <br><br>But here’s the thing: This “<i>Kryptogirl</i>” despite being “born” and grown in this <i>continuum</i> , technically wasn’t a native from it, as a clone of Supergirl, she was technically a native from the DC Universe New Earth-<i>continuum</i> (Post-Crisis/Pre-New52). So, instead of being assimilated into the canon, she was just expelled to Limbo (In other words; Krytonians do not exist in my original <i>continuum</i>, it wouldn’t be “original” if they did.).<br><br>So, my idea is to rescue this character from Limbo, bring her personality, powers and abilities closer to what was canon at the time in the DCU, give her the name “Katya” and recruit her for the Department of Improbable Crossovers.<br><br>So her powers will be left as:<br>*<b>Solar Energy Absorption</b> (Like all canon Kryptonians she has no upper limit to how much energy can hold,  though at the start she will have none, due to a prolonged lack of sunlight exposure during her long stay in Limbo and stay in the PPC HQ).<br><br>   **<b>Kryptonian Physiology</b>  (Powers under this header will be severely limited due to her physiological immaturity, though she probably still has them, as a example I could use the canon clone Superboy/Kon-El/Conner Kent, he was able to keep up for a while with the Eradicator, and survived being shocked with a three-phase power transformer. So probably, in this case; she would be at the power level of Spiderman or, at best; Aquaman.)<br><br>      ***<b>Superhuman Strength</b><br>        ****    Super Jump<br><br>      ***<b>Superhuman Speed</b><br>        ****   Superhuman Reflexes<br><br>      ***<b>Superhuman Stamina</b><br><br>      ***<b>Superhuman Durability</b><br><br>      ***<b>Superhuman Senses</b>  (Very Limited, probably near useless.)<br>       **** X-ray Vision / other EMS Visions<br>       **** Telescopic Vision<br>       ****    Microscopic Vision<br><br>      ***<b>Healing Factor</b><br><br>      ***<b>Heat Vision</b>  (She won’t able to use this one more than a few seconds, because since it uses a lot of Solar Energy, it would be cost prohibitive for her. Also she cannot control it very well.)<br><br>   **<b>Bio-Electric Aura</b>  (Her main power. Is a psionic aura that floats a few millimeters above her skin, this is the reason she has to use form-fitting clothes.)<br>      <br>***<b>Nigh-Invulnerability</b>  (Her bio-electric psionic aura subconsciously protects her from injury coming from physical assaults and some energy types. She can also extend it to protect others.)<br>     <br> ***<b>Tactile Telekinesis</b>  (She can use the aura subconsciously to prevent large objects she lifts to crumble under their weight around her human-sized hands, it also can be used consciously, for a variety of effects, like increased strength, limited hovering/floating, force blasts, etcetera.)<br><br>   **<b>Flight </b>(Fully fledged flight at high speeds by her own willpower, is subjected to the same limitations of Heat Vision.)<br><br>Now, her weaknesses will be:<br>*<b>Kryptonite Radiation</b>  (As per DCU-then-canon, severe poisoning limited to the Kryptonite native to the sub-<i>continua</i> Earth-1 (Pre-Crisis), New Earth(Post-Crisis) and Prime Earth (New52) and their alternate timelines only, Kryptonite from other alternate sub-<i>continua</i> have no visible effect on her.)<br><br>*<b>Red sunlight radiation. </b>  (Depowers her through the replacement of the empowering one in her cells.)<br><br>*<b>Magic. </b>  (Because of course! Seriously though, since her powers are biological in nature, she has no defense against magic.)<br><br>*<b>Physiological Immaturity </b> (Already touched in the powers part.  Her physical powers are very limited.)<br>   **<b>Electricity </b> (Also, since her protective aura is electric in nature, electricity will interfere with it, and since her body is not fully matured, she can be brought down with a sufficiently high voltage.)<br><br>*<b>Limited Sunlight Processing</b>  (Because of her nature as a Human/Kryptonian Hybrid clone, she can only process sunlight at half the rate that Full Kryptonians do, that makes her burn through her reserves rather quickly and make her very exhausted after a prolonged fight.)<br><br>*<b>No Combat Training</b>  (Pretty much anyone in her power league will kick her ass, because her lack of training and exercise. )<br><br>*<b>Telepathy</b>  (Unlike The Man of Steel himself, she has no psychic training, rendering her vulnerable to telepathic assaults.)<br><br>(Yes, all above means that <i>Aquaman</i> of all people can <i>effortlessly kick her ass all the way to next sunday</i>.)<br><br>She will also be equipped with a <i>Nanoha</i>-verse Output limiter/Device in the form of a bracelet, heavily modified and enchanted with indestructibility and a removal-prevention spell by DCUFA (DC Universe Fanfiction Academy. Yes, I conjured this OFU from thin air, probably I will get around to write it someday.) faculty member Doctor Fate, which magically locks most of her superhuman abilities, except for her Solar Energy Absorption and Weaknesses. This limiter can only be activated and deactivated by voice command from Department Heads and/or her assigned partner Agent (The Department Heads [ie. The Flowers] override the partner though.). The limiter is set to &quot;Active&quot; by default.<br></p>

            <p>First off, I&#39;m not really seeing a true character here. All you&#39;ve presented to us is a generic archetype with a list of powers. Archetypes are fine when you&#39;re in the early stages of drafting a character, but you can&#39;t just coast on them. A good character is more than a sentence. A good character is more than a checklist of entries from TV Tropes. You should think of a good character as an actual person, with all the complexities thereof.<br><br>I also have some qualms about what you intend this character to be used for. Based on the other posts you&#39;ve made in this thread, it seems to me that you just want to use Katya as a tool to better go toe-to-toe with superpowered Sues and Stus. I&#39;ve harped on this before, and I&#39;ll probably harp on it again in the future: PPC agents should not be fighting Sues and Stus head on. They&#39;re not soldiers and they&#39;re not Jason Bourne-esque spies; they win their &quot;fights&quot; through clever thinking and misdirection, not combat.<br><br>That&#39;s not to say agents with mega-powers can&#39;t be written, it just depends on <i>how</i> they are written. That&#39;s the true test of a character. I would like to see Katya in a drabble or two, maybe inspired by something off of the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IE81HONRJnp0IaK92GvzyL00CZYNZG_pvdo93gRMIhY/pub">Permission prompt list</a>.</p>

            <p>You don&#39;t actually <i>need</i> to cut her off from her powers or abilities to make her be an &#39;okay&#39; character for the PPC.<br><br>The important thing is that she&#39;s written <i>responsibly</i> by you. If you can&#39;t guarantee that you&#39;d write her responsibly without a built-in limiter, maybe you should reconsider using her at this time entirely. By this I don&#39;t mean have her not need it at all, but that if she was placed into the position where she misused her powers and should be in trouble (which has a good chance of happening, considering how Kara can get at times), would you be able to write out the appropriate consequences? This is the question you need to be asking yourself.<br><br><br> PPC agents don&#39;t need a surfeit of powers to be able to do what they do; my main two were completely normal baseline humans. But it also doesn&#39;t mean that when they do have powers, that you need to lock them down so they aren&#39;t Sueish. Hitting the ticky boxes does not a Sue or Stu make. The key is qualitative, not quantitative. <br><br>Beyond that, Aquaman is actually ridiculously strong. DCU Atlanteans are really tough in general because they can sustain underwater pressures that will squish a normal human. <br><br>(Also, collecting the mini &#39;Spiderman&#39;. It&#39;s always Spider-Man, with the hyphen. ;))</p>

            <p>Actually the reasons for limiting her powers are twofold:<br><br>1)Consistency: She has been over 10 years without sunlight, I&#39;ll surprised if she could even muster a little Super-Hearing.<br><br>2) PPC Cannon: The only reason she has the limiter is this line from the <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Mission_Writing_Guide">Mission Writing Guide</a>, under the &quot;Creating Your Own Agents&quot; header: &quot;<i>[...]the Flowers tend not to like having underlings with that level of power.</i>&quot; If it wasnґt for that, I wouldn&#39;t even have come with the idea for a limiter... At the start. She would have done something stupid eventually and would have been limited anyway.<br><br>I am pleasantly surprised, that someone called me out with the Aquaman bit, I know how powerful the King of the Seven Seas is, but not that much people is that well informed. I could have used Black Lighting instead, but he&#39;s not that well known nor has Aquaman&#39;s dubious call to fame. XD<br><br>Also, give back that mini! I like using it regularly!</p>

            <p>This response isn&#39;t filling me with confidence.<br><br>First off, your replies here make me feel more like you want her to have the powers so be more a handy weapon to be released than a character who has a lot of powers they have to control- the whole World of Cardboard speech that Superman had in the DCAU underlines the <i>challenges</i> presented by a character having those powers. <br><br>Secondly, the purposeful misrepresentation of Aquaman? Not really encouraging to me, personally, as a comics fan, or as someone with interest in the PPC. When you know a canon, but others don&#39;t, it is not an excuse to misrepresent it to others, especially someplace like here, especially when you&#39;re trying to use it as a point of comparison for a character you&#39;re interested in using here that you&#39;re trying to get opinions on.<br><br>Also, no, you can&#39;t have it back. Purposefully misspelling character names is in poor taste. Mine now. </p>

            <p>Seriously, I had been defending Aquaman for years from haters and suddenly, I joke about him? What was I thinking!?<br><br>Well leaving that aside, the powers are actually quite a complex issue I have been dancing around for now, that must adressed at some point. I cannot have her at HQ with the powers, or let her use them at every mission, that would be dangerous both for herself and others. But I also must find a time and place for her to train them, because seeing them like &quot;just a weapon to be released&quot; is something I don&#39;t like. Hmmm...<br><br>Hey... Didn&#39;t the Eclectic Subdivision of Advanced Species had an RC for traning? Probably I could use something like that. That would be also useful for Character Develoment, considering that her partner would be overseeing the training, therefore strengthening their bond by interacting between missions.</p>

            <p>I think the problem here is that you&#39;re approaching this backwards. 90% of the time, a character is what it is because of its personality, not because of whatever powerset it has. In fact, a lot of Sues are Sues because their authors thought &quot;Hey, that&#39;s a cool power, let&#39;s make a character with it!&quot; and didn&#39;t do anything else.<br>Let&#39;s take an agent of mine for example. Amris is a Culture Drone - a pretty powerful machine; it can cut molecular bonds with its fields, for example, deflect lasers, and the like. What makes it a character is not its powers, though; it&#39;s its bloodthirstiness, sarcasm, and somewhat kuudere relationship with his partner.<br><br>Basically, what you want to do when creating a character is to think about the personality first, then think about powers.<br><br>There are, of course, exceptions: I have a character with psychometric powers he can&#39;t control or turn off; that sort of power can, should and does affect a character in a major way. Backrow would be a completely different guy if not for his mutation.</p>

            <p>Like I said before, I first make a basic design of how I want the character to look like. Then personality and powers, if it has. One of my main characters went from shy and serious to a hyperactive Cloudcuckoolander and her powers went from blue fire to Light Magic in the span of 9 years, but always kept the basic design of &quot;asian girl with long straight black hair and glasses&quot;. Also,she <i>always</i> loves pink, I don&#39;t know why. <br><br>Some other characters were created by a question, like one of my latest characters. The question was: What would happen if a Western Otaku girl became a Magical Girl? <br><br>But Katya the Half-Kryptonian? Is an anomaly. Is a character from The Box of the Forgotten Characters. A 10-year old Bit Character/Mary Sue made in my teen years for the <s>heavily Suefied</s> first draft of my original <i>continuum</i> (Two guesses of why she never made it beyond). In other words is a character that I&#39;m trying to rescue and rehabilitate, not a character that I just created few days ago.<br><br>(Besides, thanks to an oportunate question by Darkotas down there, I got an idea to build Katya&#39;s personality, now I&#39;m just left with the Superpower Dilemma.)</p>

The important thing is the person behind the character - if powers weren&#39;t a part of the equation at all, what kind of person would this character be? If I&#39;m interpreting this correctly (and I apologize if I&#39;m not), you have a set of powers, and then build the personality and character behind it afterwards. While this works for the DC universe, I don&#39;t think it would work in the context of an agent.<br><br>I think it really comes down to the difference between Superman and Batman. For Superman, the hero is the mask - he considers himself as Clark Kent at heart. For Batman, Bruce Wayne is the mask - the true individual is the Bat. Which would your character consider herself to be closer to?</p>

            <p>...I design in my mind the character&#39;s appeareance first, everything else comes later, usually I work with powers (if it has) and personality at the same time, updating the looks if necessary. Well, that&#39;s today, 10 years ago... I don&#39;t quite remember, my mind as a teen is now a fuzzy memory.<br><br>Regarding your question, I&#39;m not quite sure about which character are you asking about. Is about the one mentioned in my last response, or is the character which all this thread is about? Anyway I&#39;ll answer about both.<br><br>For the character mentioned in the response:<br>Maia Matsuno a.k.a. <i>Skylight</i>; for her the hero is the mask, a mask to show to the public and the media, which uses light-based powers she never asked for in the first place, the one who receives all attention she never liked to receive, a &quot;Beacon of Hope&quot; for all the new heroes rising fifteen years after an alien invasion that nearly exterminated superhumans, a &quot;Messiah&quot; she doesn&#39;t want be. All she wants is to be Maia, the tomboy girl who plays videogames, watches TV, hangs out with friends and never is the center of attention. The who uses glasses because is nearsighted, and not because is hiding her identity, because learning your mother is a Greek Goddess is cool, but becoming the center of attention for the world because you&#39;re the first superhuman in 15 years, is not. But sadly, there&#39;s no going back in time. Now there&#39;s only accepting it, steping forward and try to be the heroine everybody spects her to be.<br><br>Now about Katya, well, sheґs the mask... And there&#39;s nothing under it... Nothing at all. You see, I created both characters at the same time (I think <i>Skylight</i> was named Lightstar or something like that at the time) , but in the last 10 years, while Katya was sent to Limbo; <i>Skylight</i> had 6 reboots, 4 re-designs, 3 character merges, 1 retcon, Character Development and a <i>massive power boost</i>! Also, she received... WAITAMINUTE! A daughter (Actually two, but only the first one is important for this)! &quot;...going back in time&quot;? That&#39;s it!<br><br>Aiko, Maia&#39;s daughter is <i>perfect</i> for this! &#39;Cuz she always gets into this kind of shenanigans, and her personality gives me the base to build up Katya&#39;s one! <br><br>Darkotas, I can only thank you for this, your question put me into this train of thought and allowed me to solve most of the problems with the Half-Kryptonian! (I still have some, but those can be solved with plot.) Thank you again!</p>

            <p>She&#39;s got a PK Supergirl-setup from the Whateley Universe continuum that&#39;s a lot closer to being the actual Supergirl. Cool, we can work with that. Her comparative immaturity and power-limiter artifact will help, but I think the big downside is actually the electricity aura if you make it sensitive. Sod Aquaman, she can get taken down by a no-name kid with a Taser.<br><br>I definitely think that in this case, the Flowers would demand that her limiter is also, for want of a better term, a shock collar. If she should turn against the PPC for whatever reason, well, she&#39;s got an off switch on her wrist.

            <p>Actually, she&#39;ll without powers most of the time, even in HQ. Period. The idea of a unstable and hormonal teeager with this kind of power is certainly <i>terrifyng</i>. Her powers will be only for dealing with overpowered Sues/overpowered Possessed Canons, like: Green Lanterns, The Avatar, other Kryptonians, Magical Ice-Wielding Queens, Saiyans, Etc.<br><br>And actually her backstory is in the main post: Is a clone of Kara Zor-El/Supergirl combined with human DNA for stability and the only survivor of an erased Sue-verse, that was expelled into Limbo by the Power of Retcon(tm). Most of the deal with her story, will be her discovering her personality and gathering actual experiences.

            <p>But you still have to <i>write</i> her with a personality, unless you plan on her responding to everything with a stare and a flat tone.

            <p>So hey, next month is the <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/PPC_Boarder_Shipfic_Fest">Shipfest</a> - pardon me, the PPC Boarder Shipfic Fest - and in the same spirit as <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?id=199610;article=253987;search_term=shipfest">last year</a>, let&#39;s list our ships!<br><br>This is <i>not</i> the Shipfest itself; it&#39;s not the thread for stories, or for signing up to say you&#39;re willing to appear in them. It&#39;s just a thread of pure madness wherein we list the pairings (and morings) we ship in the PPC community. And then the list will be used to kick-start the actual Shipfest, because that&#39;s heaps of fun. <sup>_<sup><br><br>Da</sup></sup> Rules:<br><br>-List your PPC Community ships - people in the PPC community (not organisation) that you totally think are/should be together.<br>-Give <i>reasons</i> for your ships. Otherwise it&#39;s just a random name generator.<br>-Revenge shipping is perfectly okay!<br>-Shipping someone with yourself - if you&#39;re not actually in a relationship - should be avoided; that&#39;s a bit creepy.<br>-<b>No stories.</b> This is just a list. Stories is next month.<br>-Have fun! It&#39;s a ludicrous exercise in ridiculousness, after all.<br><br>If you have a vehement objection to being even mentioned in a ship name, speak up, and people won&#39;t do it; it&#39;s as simple as that. And again - when the Shipfest comes round, no-one will write stories with you in them unless you specifically give consent.<br><br>So... let the shipping commence!<br><br>hS<br><br>(My ships are in the first reply, of course)</p>

            <p>This isn&#39;t really about relationships or dating - it&#39;s more about... think of it as a sort of massive crackfic!fest, where the premise is &quot;all of HQ is doused with hyper-reactive hormones and go into super-lust mode.&quot; So nobody&#39;s trying to set anybody up for a lovey-relationship where the Boarders go out for coffee and stare soulfully into each other&#39;s eyes and then get married. <br><br>I mean, last year there was a PPC boyband that turned into an orgy. I would place a great deal of money on the theory that a significant majority of participants in the first shipfests had never been in a relationship either – I certainly hadn&#39;t. It really is just for the absurdity factor - not to be taken seriously at all. </p>

            <p>Friendly advice: You keep mentioning how you don&#39;t do relationships and are basically date poison. You should probably stop doing that if you actually want to be involved more. Taking this game seriously when it could not touch reality with a fifty-foot pole makes it unfun.<br><br>Also, don&#39;t do the Nice Guy thing, <i>especially</i> if you&#39;re being serious. As <a href="http://www.cracked.com/blog/6-harsh-truths-that-will-make-you-better-person/">an article I read recently</a> expressed it (more or less), you don&#39;t get a gold star with the ladies just for doing the bare minimum of not being a jerk.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>That dude I avoid being just by... well, not interacting with women for the most part.

            <p>...is you. If you keep telling yourself that nobody would ever want to date you, then it will become a self-fulfilling prophecy. <br>Here&#39;s the thing: don&#39;t view women as something &quot;different&quot; from yourself. They&#39;re human beings too, with the same interests and aspirations as anyone else! Now, I understand that it can be very difficult to interact with those of the opposite gender if you&#39;re shy or simply just adverse to doing so, but if you ever want change... You have to bring it about on your own.<br><br>Here&#39;s what I suggest. If you want to practice interaction with the opposite gender, use what you have to your advantage. This Board has quite a few girls around - get their advice too! Don&#39;t view stuff you say or do around women in a dating context - make some friends of the opposite gender, and be comfortable doing things with them. It will go a long way when you do start searching for a partner.</p>

I&#39;m really not sure what to do now, since my computer is broken and my parents are super-busy taking care of my younger siblings. <br><br>I rarely leave my room, let alone the house.

            <p>Yes, pizza is a dish that takes <i>much</i> of its influence from Italy, but the dish itself is an American one! It was a modification by Italian-American immigrants in the Northeast (depending on your bias, New York, New Haven, or, from one person I know, Providence) from pita in the 1930s – and, just FYI, the tomato is native to Central America, and wasn&#39;t even present in Europe until <i>well</i> into the Columbian exchange, because Europeans thought it was poisonous. So any dish based on tomatoes (or corn, or potatoes, or turkeys...) can sorta be said to be necessarily partly American in origin.</p>

            <p>But the thing WE call pizza: a very specific kind of dough, with a specific style of marinara spread over it (you can&#39;t just use gravy, it&#39;s the wrong consistency), topped with sausage, or onion, or clams, or eggplant, or garlic, or thinly-sliced tomatoes and basil, or any of the above, then covered in mozzarella and baked until done... most certainly did not.<br><br>Or at least, it was modified so heavily by the Italian-American community in New Haven that &quot;pizza&quot; as we mean it here is a distinct food from its distant ancestor.<br><br>But back to your original gripe - Pizza Hut bears as much resemblance to pizza, as I knew it growing up, as a can of Dole&#39;s pineapple does to the original pineapple fruits. <s>And Chicago doesn&#39;t count.</s> That much, at least, we can agree on.</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve just looked up &#39;pizza&#39; in the Oxford English Dictionary.<br><br>They claim that the word derives from post-classical Latin dating back to at least AD 997, and may have come in from &#39;an unattested Langobardic cognate of Old High German <i>bizzo</i> bite, piece bitten off, morsel, lump, cake made of flour&#39;. (Which means that Germany was calling some form of food something close to &#39;pizza&#39; before Italy was... but I digress.)<br><br>The first attested use in the English literature is actually an English-Italian dictionary from 1598 - that&#39;s  over 150 years before the USA was founded - where it was listed as &#39;a kind of cake or simnell or wafer&#39;. In 1825 Baroness Bunsen was fed it (along with &#39;ham, and cheese, and <i>frittata</i>&#39;), and in 1845, Francis Coghlan&#39;s <i>Handbook for Italy</i> described it as &#39;a popular cake made of preserves or of new cheese&#39;.<br><br>But the best reference dates to 1878, and a book called <i>Dolce Napoli</i>:<br><br>&#39;Anoint [dough] profusely with oil of olive, and dab in pieces of garlic, anchovy, strong cheese, rancid bacon, and whatsoever else may be highest in flavour and lowest in price; put into a hot oven, bake, and thou hast pizza.&#39;<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Pizza Hut is garbage! As is any chain American pizza. <br><br>You want to know the masterpiece that is American pizza? You come to the States, find a local joint that has no more then three locations in the entire United States, and buy a slice of heaven. Do you want thin crust or deep dish? Sweet or savory sauce? What toppings? Don&#39;t matter, find the most popular slice there, get one, and find out why you may have invented the best food on earth, but America has perfected the best food in the universe.</p>

            <p>I, myself, am a fan of the Avalanche pizza sold at Moose&#39;s Tooth. It has Pepperoni, blackened chicken, bacon bits, red onions, parsley, cheddar, mozzarella, provolone, and a very sweat and tangy barbecue sauce to round it all off. One of the best pizzas I have ever had. Anybody come over to Anchorage, I&#39;ll buy you a slice or two.</p>

            <p>Where did you get your pizza? I&#39;ll bet you anything it&#39;s Pizza Hut. Listen, do you go to McDonalds for quality burgers? KFC for quality fried chicken? Dairy Queen for quality anything? No. So if it was an international chain you bought your pizza at, you have a problem.<br><br>I am so tempted to find some good pizza joint that will send their pizzas abroad and teach you all why America has mastered putting cheese and tomato sauce on bread. But by that time, it would not be hot and fresh out of the oven, and ruin the point. So, instead, you fly over here, go to New York, and get one of America&#39;s best pizzas.</p>

            <p>What&#39;s the difference between proper Italian pizza and the export version? <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pizza">Wikipedia&#39;s</a> mostly waffling about specific types of tomato and cheese, which is a non-starter (since that&#39;s a quality issue at most). I&#39;m getting a vague impression it&#39;s partly about the &#39;bread&#39; used for the base - the top image on Wiki certainly looks more like a flatbread with toppings than an export-style &#39;pizza base&#39;, and there&#39;s a quite mouthwatering description of Sicilian-style pizza as &#39;essentially focaccia with toppings&#39; - but I&#39;m guessing there&#39;s more to it than that?<br><br>(Fun fact: the first time I ran across the Italian disdain for American &#39;pizza&#39; was in Rick Riordan&#39;s <i>The Mark of Athena</i>)<br><br>O&#39;course, it&#39;s a good general assumption that any &#39;regional&#39; food will be horribly mutilated in other countries. Heaven knows England&#39;s most popular dish - Chicken Tikka Masala - bears no resemblance to actual Indian curries (which, having once had one made by a genuine Indian person, are very nice)... for that matter, even Yorkshire Puddings are completely different to actual Yorkshire Puddings unless you make them yourself.<br><br>Yeah, that&#39;s the key. Shop-bought food is different to homemade. Even something as simple as chips (er, fries, I guess). What a world, etc.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Italians use less sauce then we do, and thinner too. We also have a larger variety of flavors our sauce can be, ranging on the sweet and savory scale, while Italian is usually on the sweeter scale, wherever you would place a fresh tomato on the scale.<br><br>America loves toppings. We put darn near anything and everything on our pizzas. Pineapple, ham, sausage, peperoni, bell peppers, hot peppers, steak tips, you name it. If it can be eaten, odds are somebody in America has placed it on a pizza. Italians? Not as such. They do not put near the variety, not amount of meat that we Americans do. What can I say? Bigger is better.<br><br>Speaking of bigger is better, the crust. You want to start a fight in America? Tell somebody from Chicago that thin crust is superior, or tell somebody from New York that Chicago style is the best. There will be blood on the streets. Suffice to say, we have a wide opinion over how thick the crust should be. We can almost universally agree though, thicker than Italy&#39;s. Theirs is not paper-thin, but in comparison, they are eating communion wafers with cheese.<br><br>Aside from that, there are some subtle differences, but if I went further then that, we would be going into the differences between regions of pizza in America. So, suffice to say, there is a bit of difference.<br><br>Also, halibut pizza? Rather tasty.</p>

            <p>Ship fics are fun! I have no requirements. However, I do have a &quot;challenge&quot; of sorts. Feel free to ignore it for humor.<br><br>You all know how much I love ponies. Perhaps to an absurd degree. For my challenge, you cannot use mlp at all in the shipping. However, again, if you found a way for it to be funny, please, use pony humor. Just... Consider it bonus points if you manage to ship me properly without using my love for little ponies.<br><br>Now, do I want to ship anybody... Hmm...<br><br>ScarmorySilver/Storme Hawk - Because love is for the birds!<br><br>Huinesoron/Kaitlyn - Because I need to make up for what the Knight Jumper said in Plort.<br><br>Scapegrace/shark - Because now I can&#39;t get the idea of a Tsundere Shark shipping out of my head.</p>

            <p>...I usually prefer to be paired with Boarders whom I&#39;ve gotten to know on a personal level, typically by co-writing with them. This would kinda preclude me/Storme, and I get the sense that the two of us are constantly being shipped just because both of our usernames include a bird of some sort.<br><br>THAT SAID, assuming Storme has permission (and given that he does have agents listed in his user page on the Wiki, I&#39;m guessing he does), I&#39;d be happy to collab with him once I come out of all of my school and job-searching stuff. Especially since my upcoming DIC team will be taking on a lot of video-game continua. Apparently, we&#39;re not just birds, but gamers as well!</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve never had any love life to speak of (I did have an IRL date last year, but it didn&#39;t work out), so I&#39;m not sure if shipping me with another Boarder would be worth anyone&#39;s time to be honest. If I had to reccommend any partners for me, though, I&#39;d go with eatpraylove and Iximaz, both of which I got to know via collabs. A close second pick, as a few of you have guessed, is Herr-Wozzeck, whose writing was one of the reasons for my joining the PPC in the first place; if he ever comes back I would like to co-write with him as well.<br><br>Probably not Storme Hawk, though. Don&#39;t know him on a personal level despite us being birds and all. And I honestly have no idea why hS would be referred to as a bird, either.<br><br>Between other Boarders, I&#39;d probably go with Neshomeh/Tungsten Monk and Caddy/Miah, both of which have again co-written some really good stuff.</p>

            <p>So, when I finish with <i>Rose Potter</i>, I&#39;m planning on bringing in a Time Lord agent, just regenerated. Like, <i>just</i> regenerated. What are some of the problems previous Doctors experienced? I know we have delirium, confusion, temporary amnesia, motor control issues, and near-comas. Anything else?<br><br>Also, I don&#39;t think it was very clear how long the leftover regeneration energy stayed. Ten&#39;s seemed to stick around for a while, so maybe a day or so?</p>

            <p>I&#39;m pretty sure Ten specifies in <i>The Christmas Invasion</i>, when he&#39;s explaining why his hand&#39;s just regrown (or is about to); if you have access to that, check.<br><br>Since you&#39;ve said this is a first regeneration, bear in mind that they tend to get more severe as the cycle goes on. The Doctor&#39;s first regeneration was very low-key, and he was back on his feet almost instantly. Melody Pond&#39;s <i>second</i> regeneration didn&#39;t really affect her at all - well, it made her slightly psychotic, but in terms of confusion, no.<br><br>You might also want to note the first (known) regeneration of Romana: she was apparently able to select her new form with a fine degree of control. This ties in quite nicely with the regrowth/repair aspects seen with Ten and River, actually.<br><br>Also: regeneration energy can be used as a weapon in that early timeframe. Again, see River&#39;s attack on Berlin.<br><br>And the main effect you&#39;ve missed from the Doctor&#39;s regenerations is &#39;manic energy&#39;. Four jumped up and started jogging on the spot; Eight got waaaaay hyper; Ten, Eleven, and Twelve all manically crashed the TARDIS.

            <p>Romana kind of had an idea what to expect beforehand though, didn&#39;t she? Anyway, when you say the Doctor&#39;s first regeneration was low-key, you mean just in terms of behavior, right? Also, how canon are we talking when it comes to big blasts of energy? Because probably due to the special effects of the time, there wasn&#39;t any of this glowy-blasty-boom stuff in Classic Who, but it started in NewWho, and even early regenerations like River&#39;s were quite explosive. So which precedent do we use?</p>

            <p>One, Three, and Four all definitely had people leaning over them when they regenerated. Contrast that with the &#39;get back!&#39; nature of the more recent regenerations, and you have a definite progression.<br><br>In fact, the only outlier to the idea that early regenerations are more sedate than later ones is River; she regenerated a total of twice, and her second regeneration was a full-on light show. But maybe she&#39;s just a showoff? ;)<br><br>I think you could argue that &#39;the light-show&#39; is common to all regenerations, but in the less dramatic versions, it&#39;s constrained to the &#39;glow moves over the hands&#39; stuff; that would explain the way the Classic doctors often glowed, without requiring a justification for the fact that they didn&#39;t stand up and do the YMCA.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Your agent&#39;s still got enough artron energy in their system to do serious damage up until about the fifteen-hour mark. Plus, you&#39;ll recall that compared to humans, Time Lords are very, very strong and pretty difficult to kill. You&#39;ve also got a grace period of about an hour wherein the Time Lord in question is basically a shapeshifter since their form hasn&#39;t gelled yet.<br><br>The obvious answer is to lock &#39;em in their own TARDIS until the regeneration weirdness has subsided, but that&#39;s kind of dull. =]</p>

            <p>Especially the ones that anyone can access. Why does bad music happen? Why does bad drawing happen? Why does bad dance happen?<br><br>The answer is gonna be pretty much the same. There have been plenty of good answers so far, but I wanna touch on a couple aspects that haven&#39;t been discussed so much:<br><br>1. Everyone has strengths and weaknesses. Not everyone can be strong at writing/singing/underwater basket-weaving. This does not make those people stupid or lazy, it just means their talents lie elsewhere.<br><br>2. Not everyone has access to the same level of encouragement or instruction in their art. To use a personal example, my parents read to me every night as a kid—specifically, they would read to me from books that were more advanced than I could yet read myself, so I was exposed to things &quot;above my grade.&quot; Naturally, when I started writing, I based my stories on the stories I knew and impressed everyone by making a chapter book in third grade. The books I knew had chapters, so obviously my story should have them, too. Each chapter was about a paragraph or two, of course, but OMG, this little third-grader is so advanced! I was praised and encouraged and given every opportunity to succeed, I have smart parents who speak and write well, I went to good schools, and I&#39;m naturally a perfectionist, so I try to do things right just for the sake of being right. (And I can get a little pissy when challenged about my rightness.)<br><br>I had every advantage. Not everyone does. Some people aren&#39;t read to from chapter books at a young age. Some people aren&#39;t told by their families that writing well is valuable and praiseworthy. Some people don&#39;t get to go to great schools. Some people&#39;s parents didn&#39;t receive a college-level education and therefore can&#39;t set a college-educated example. Some people don&#39;t go out of their way to learn how to use semi-colons just for the sake of being right. If they find out they&#39;re passionate about writing anyway, even if they&#39;re naturally talented, they&#39;re gonna have a much harder time getting really good at it.<br><br>This is one reason we don&#39;t attack authors. It is quite possible that they are intelligent, wonderful people who just happen to have written a bad story because, for whatever reason, writing is more of a struggle for them.<br><br>THAT SAID... if you&#39;re dedicated enough to read/watch/play the canon five times, write a story based on it, and get access to the Internet to post it... you have all the resources you need to at least get the canon details right, not to mention spellcheck. I think there&#39;s a noticeable difference between a story by someone who&#39;s trying but just doesn&#39;t know what they&#39;re doing and a story by someone who&#39;s chucking canon and logic out the window for the sake of forcing their &quot;original&quot; ideas on the world and expecting to be lauded for it. The former don&#39;t make good missions and don&#39;t deserve to be sporked anyway. The latter do.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>They both intertwine, but can also work independently. (I also won&#39;t be offering any comments on SPG stuff, because I&#39;ve always been <i>good</i> at that, so I don&#39;t know where it comes from.)<br><br>1/ Well... they&#39;re teenagers. Virtually all teenagers, whether they be 14 or 18, see themselves (mostly unconsciously) as the centre of the world. They think that their troubles are unique in all of history, that everything which upsets them was deliberately designed to do so, that everyone is thinking about them all the time, when in fact, the people around them are just as self-centred.<br><br>And what does that produce in stories? Main characters for who that is literally true. I came to writing fairly late; the first story I class as a &#39;real&#39; story was written when I was 14 (and was, I think, the only lengthy bit of fiction I ever had to write for school). And it was... pretty bad. A teenager (because another component of this is that you tend to write characters your own age, because you know you&#39;re competent and can do stuff!) discovered that the world was going to be destroyed, and singlehandedly came up with and implemented a solution. Because of course he did.<br><br>And the next one was... well, not quite as bad, but still the same. It&#39;s actually <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=1SmXeBiaX-CmxaLQtYbskxCI_iCnwy8jBg8zCskzvgbg">available online</a> for the sole purpose of showing what teenaged writing looks like; it was written in about 2002, when I was 16 - the age you claim I should have &#39;grasped the concepts of plot, conflict, and character development&#39;. Want to reconsider that? XD<br><br>The thing is, it&#39;s hard. All protagonists are the centre of <i>their story</i>; no matter how much you read (and believe me, I read a <i>lot</i>), it&#39;s hard to spot how that differs from being the centre of their <i>world</i>. Jacob Ethrax solves everything singlehanded - well, so does Sam Vimes, so what&#39;re you complaining about? Spotting the difference - that Vimes has to work <i>within</i> the system, rather than remaking it in his own image - is... well, see point 2.<br><br>2/ Practice. I talked about this <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=268863;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">last week</a>; I&#39;ll quote a section of that post here:<br><br><i>They write badly because they don&#39;t know how to write well. Look at <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=1wTAwwbPuJPQpkAMEZ889DOioo7YprR-qFyqbd0KjSSc">Rings of Power</a>, a mission I did into a story I wrote. I have a whole bunch of writing from about that time which consists of:<br><br>-Group of people encounter situation.<br>-Every single thing which happens in the area affects them.<br>-No-one can solve anything without their help.<br>-They get all the good stuff.<br><br>I did the research. I knew the layout of Lothlorien, and the timeline of the books. I didn&#39;t make up nonsensical, non-canonical stuff. But I hadn&#39;t learnt enough to let the protagonists operate in the world, rather than warping it around them. If they ran into trouble, it was specifically aimed at them - because that makes for added tension, right? R...right?<br><br>The vast majority of badfic writers are young, and still learning to write - heck, I was probably sixteen or seventeen when I wrote that, not even that &#39;young&#39;! But it&#39;s very rare that people can write really well without lots and lots of practice. No, reading a lot doesn&#39;t help: it takes practice to realise that you are doing it differently to Terry Pratchett, or J.K. Rowling, or what have you. And you won&#39;t notice by reading back your own story, either.</i><br><br>And to add to that: the fact that you can&#39;t see the difference also means that you won&#39;t have a problem putting it online. Why should you? You can&#39;t see anything wrong with your story! And experience has shown that your reviews will consist in large part of people saying &#39;gud story i want to kno what happens neckst&#39; - so it <i>must</i> be good! - and the occasional person who says &#39;your a tebirrle writer you should kill yourself and ***** your ***** with a *****&#39; - or even just &#39;this is a terrible story your character sucks stop writing&#39;, which feels exactly the same. Actual constructive criticism is <i>really really rare</i>.<br><br>3/ Wait, didn&#39;t I say there were only two points?<br><br>4/ Hang on, stop<br><br>5/ making ne<br><br>6/ w po<br><br>7/ i<br><br>8/ n<br><br>9/ ts <i>will you cut that out?</i><br><br>... thank you. As I was saying: I think the PPC is really good for young writers. I don&#39;t mean the writers whose stories we go into - I mean <i>us</i>, the community. My logic is this:<br><br>Young writers have a hard time making their characters not be the centre of the world. But the PPC is a soulless bureaucracy. However fabulous your agent is, the boss won&#39;t like her; Intelligence won&#39;t give her better missions; Makes-Things won&#39;t make new tech for her; and she will never actually fix the problem of bad writing. I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s impossible, but it is <i>very hard</i> for a PPC agent to be written as the centre of the world; the world she inhabits just doesn&#39;t care enough about her. And that&#39;s what writers really need to learn.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Seeing as I am one of those people who wrote a badfic and was over the age of 16. From my personal experience English teachers aren&#39;t teaching enough SPaG stuff, sure they cover the basics but then they move on to studying Shakespeare or Lord of the Flies and expect essays on that instead, there&#39;s very little creative writing done in schools, at least that I&#39;m aware of, only one piece of coursework out of the ten or so I did during GCSE English was creative writing (it&#39;s also the one of the two things I got an A* in in GCSE), and even before GCSE there seemed to be very little stuff done on creative writing at all. The other problem I had was my handwriting, it was and still is horrible and the English department at my school were SO focused on getting it legible that I missed a huge amount of lesson time in favour of trying to get my fingers into a position they couldn&#39;t physically bend themselves into, thus I still don&#39;t know how to use things like semi colons correctly. <br><br>I guess what I&#39;m theorizing is that English teachers aren&#39;t necessarily teaching us enough about creative writing for people to write things like fan and original fiction, well with decent SPaG and good grasps of plot, character development etc. And without studying further, or with friends more well versed in using the English language to help, Suethors could just not be aware that what they&#39;re doing is wrong, especially seeing as most reviews on fanfiction go along the lines of &quot;Great work, please keep it up&quot; and only a very few people actually take their time to stop and point out what is going wrong, and even then it may not necessarily be done in the most friendly fashion.<br><br>Storme Hawk<br> </p>

            <p>English teachers continue teaching SPaG through at least sophomore year of high school, but don&#39;t really cover anything new since sixth grade. My freshman teacher required us to cite in MLA format without teaching us MLA format; when I asked, she said she wanted us to &quot;figure it out.&quot; Giving any more than mild criticism in peer review is also strongly frowned upon, which may be a lot of it, and an English teacher has never given lessons on not making Mary Sues. (None of mine, anyway.)<br><br>I think it&#39;s more likely they&#39;re doing one or both of two things: typing up on a smartphone and not bothering to fix errors or just being lazy because, while they know proper grammar, they don&#39;t think they need to use it in fanfiction. <br><br>One small note, however: none of my English teachers have taught semicolons.

            <p>The English classes I&#39;ve had in high school focused mostly on analyzing other works. And by that, I don&#39;t mean the characters as, you know, characters. What we analyzed were how characters and plots were metaphors for other things. We never learned how to write.<br><br>Really, the closest thing I had to a writing class was AP English Composition, but it really just taught us how to analyze a piece of literature to meet the teacher&#39;s expectations. I never learned how to write a good essay or a good story in that class,which is hilarious considering the teacher was obsessed with &#39;good&#39; essays.<br><br>I learned my SPaG by following examples in books, and reading in general. Of course, though I learned the best stories are ones with believable characters and engaging plots, I didn&#39;t learn how to do that except for trying it myself. I failed horribly, but at least I learned.<br><br>Part of why some Suethors might have horrible SPaG is because they honestly don&#39;t realize what they&#39;re doing is wrong. I&#39;ve complained about my English teacher not knowing the difference between your/you&#39;re, but it&#39;s a valid complaint since these are the people we pay to teach that sort of thing. Would you let a doctor give you the wrong medication? Then why are we letting English teachers teach improper grammar? <br><br>Sorry, got off on a tangent there. What I was going to say before I got sidetracked is that some Suethors might think they&#39;re so good already that they don&#39;t need to improve or get a beta.

            <p>For your point about maturing by 16, I&#39;d say not necessarily. It really depends on your education and your interests. If you start writing at 12 or 13 sheer practice will make you improve over time, but if you start later you&#39;ll take longer to get good. There&#39;s a difference between grasping a concept and being able to execute it.<br><br>When it comes to repeat offenders, or just bad writing in general, my theory would be that Suethors view the act of writing differently than we do.<br><br>Most of us are, more or less, serious about writing. Even if we&#39;re not shooting for a professional career in it we want to tell compelling stories and create or interpret characters in engaging ways. When it comes to fanfics we want to tell more stories in the worlds we&#39;ve come to love. When people write badly it&#39;s at best a waste of potential.<br><br>But look at the excuses Suethors throw out when they&#39;re criticized. &quot;It&#39;s just fanfiction!&quot; &quot;Get a life!&quot; For them, fanfiction is a tool for their own entertainment, mostly escapism and wish fulfillment. It&#39;s a hobby and it just has to hit the right buttons for the author and maybe people with her tastes. To them we&#39;re taking everything too seriously. And if it was their private space instead of the internet, they&#39;d have a point. The wiki covers the issues with criticism pretty well.<br><br>Basically my guess is that Suethors, in most cases, probably could write better, but they don&#39;t see a need to because &quot;it&#39;s just for fun.&quot;</p>

            <p>Everybody writes for fun, and everybody has written a sue or stu once in their life. Heck, writing a sue can help you improve your writing and characters, and it&#39;s pretty hilarious. But if your story won&#39;t hold much interest for others, you shouldn&#39;t tack it online for the world to see. Alright, show it to a couple of friends, or if you want to get serious, a beta reader. But if your fic is appealing to your own interests, and not necessarily others, then don&#39;t post it.<br><br>Either way, your post is quite enlightening. Thank you for throwing some light onto the shadowy depths of a suethor&#39;s mind. <sup>_^</sup> Someday, we might finally find out why sues hate dresses so much. And can somehow have anorexic-thin limbs while sporting double-D sized knockers.</p>

            <p>From what I can tell, Sues hate dresses because the writers feel insecure about not being traditionally feminine. Which, well, does make sense, but it tends to just translate into silliness. Mainly because they&#39;re translating anger and frustration at the messages of society into superficial anger at a thing. <br><br>This was probably too in-depth for the question of why Sues hate dresses, but oh well.<br><br>And the other question is a reversal; it&#39;s wish fulfillment about being *even better* than the other people at being &quot;beautiful&quot; as society sees it.</p>

            <p>I think I&#39;ve seen something on tumblr explaining as trying to make the character more &quot;not like other girls.&quot; The entire mindset of a Mary Sue is to be special, so it&#39;s not much of a surprise that they&#39;ll try to break away from the (disappearing) stereotype. In badfic, practically all girls besides the sue and her friends are depicted as shallow, attention-seeking, prissy, bratty, etc. to make the sue seem more &quot;outcast.&quot; It&#39;s pretty sad, now that I think about it. :|</p>

            <p>...when are well written. Heck, I found a fic with a Mary Sue protagonist with many crimes against canon. But the Waterbending Sue and her 60 page epic through Middle-Earth, was so compelling, engaging and heartwarming; that I decided against reporting it as a badfic. Seriously, it made me enjoy a Romance story, and I <b>hate</b> Romace.<br><br>(The prequel on the other hand... Let&#39;s just say I&#39;m completely willing to kill The Avatar)</p>

            <p>If the story is enjoyable, that is, enjoyable beyond reading how hilariously bad it is, then a Mary Sue isn&#39;t that bad. It is incredibly hard to /find/ that, of course, but hey.<br><br>One fic I recall comes to mind, and coincidentally enough it&#39;s also an Avatar: TLA fic. Well, minus the crossover, haha.<br><br>Sokka; Master of the Black Sword. 200K+ words, dead-fic, and adds in a large amount of Lovecraftian influenced lore and elements. Sokka becomes a (Spoiler) version of the Avatar, the Incarna. While he certainly gains power, he doesn&#39;t end up sidelining anyone out of importance in the plot, and the antagonists, both canon and not, are still treated as a threat. (Then again, maybe it&#39;s not really Sueish since it&#39;s a well written AU? Haha. I won&#39;t ask anyone to find/read the fic just for input, though. It&#39;s a long read.)<br><br>I find that, when reading a Sue, the first thing to make the experience un-enjoyable is their personality. Aside from the usual unbelievable traits most sues have, which bend the story to comedy Spork-worthy levels, I find reading about a nasty person being nasty to the canons because they have a Tragic Past(TM) or what have you isn&#39;t really fun, to me. <br><br>Once beyond that, balancing out the power seems the biggest hurdle. I&#39;m sure the Waterbending Sue faced a lot of hardship, even if not all on the battlefield. As long as you never have to ask yourself &#39;Why don&#39;t they just solve the plot/issue with their powers, if they have so many&#39; then you can have some suspense. <br><br>I recall a Negima/Naruto crossover, where Naruto had so much power almost right from the start that he never faced any ACTUAL adversity the whole fic. I even read a forum where the people on it sporked it (So I read it twice, I guess. *Lashes back with flail*) and came to the conclusion that Naruto himself was the Final Boss/Big Bad Evil Guy, since he was now so strong, and had so much power from both canons that the /Villians/ (The Akatsuki, Madara, Tobi/Obito) were all the underdogs in the story, clearly facing someone they can never beat. <br><br>Well, that and the fic had a billion other things wrong with it, SpaG aside, but the main thing is, if the protag is unbeatable, and you can&#39;t create ways to challenge them (Like say, Superman writers do)then it&#39;s hard to have any investment beyond lols. <br><br>Heh, I guess I went off on a tangent here. The Naruto/Negima fic is Naruto Chaos Mage, if anyone is interested in reading it. I&#39;ll even throw in a complementary whip so you can physically pain yourself while you melt your brain!  <a href="http://s13.zetaboards.com/Ala_Iridia/topic/7061859/1/"> The link to the Sporking can be found here, because it will be much more enjoyable, I assume you. </a></p>

            <p>I can certainly see why she would. The fic is a bit rough around the edges. It&#39;s been a while since I read the Sokka fic I mentioned, and I have a tendency to remember anything as being better then it may have been, so it could also be rough as well.<br><br>The name of the Sue makes me imagine Terumi ala Blazblue trolling around LoTR. Well, perhaps Mei Terumi from Naruto would fit better. <br><br>Your are also correct, or so I think anyway, about the comics. We all know that the hero will save the say, in the older ones anyway. Now having cliff-hanger&#39;s and trilogies is pretty common in comics. I haven&#39;t seen much of anything Superman related, minus a review of the latest film (Man of Steel) and Superman Vs The Elite (Highly Recommended. Superman is voiced by Sephiroth in it!).<br><br>But I remember watching plenty of Batman; The Animated Series as a young Caddy, and enjoying it. That&#39;s around the time when I recall Batman becoming more complex, compared to the Adam West one that I was also watching.<br><br>In the end, it&#39;s good the PPC isn&#39;t about policing fanfiction, or these gems we like would make us dirty cops, hahaha! Well, that and Sporking a fic over 100K words is a daunting task unless you can find a nice cutoff point.</p>

            <p>They never actually existed. There was a thread attempting to create them, and someone (Phobos?) put all the ideas from it up on the Wiki, but the concept never really got off the ground.<br><br>So if you&#39;re volunteering to shake out the problems with it... well, here goes:<br><br>The purpose of the houses (as opposed to just having people ask for a Big Sib) is to let folks focus their search. So if your main reason for being in the PPC is to talk in the IRC, say, then you want a Big Sib who can help with that, rather than, say, me, who&#39;ll go &#39;I&#39;unno&#39;.<br><br>So, houses. The list as it currently stands, ignoring the two &#39;I&#39;ve come up with a name and want to be special&#39; entries, is:<br><br>-PPC stuff<br>-Writing<br>-Concrit<br>-Fandom<br>-The PPC community<br><br>That&#39;s a fairly decent breakdown of what the PPC does, actually. I might be tempted to combine Writing and Concrit, since they&#39;re covering mostly the same ground (ie, &#39;how to write&#39;), and I&#39;d probably be tempted to add a house for RPs, since they come up quite frequently, but it&#39;s decent.<br><br>But... I&#39;m not sure we&#39;re really divided that strongly. People <i>don&#39;t</i> join the PPC just to talk about fandom (I hope); they join it because they like the stories, and maybe they want to write as well, and and and. So the houses are artificial lines, and I think they might be too strong.<br><br>They also don&#39;t help with the &#39;hS knows nothing about the IRC&#39; problem; what if someone signs up to whatever I&#39;m in because they&#39;re really into that, and then wants to go into the IRC? I can&#39;t offer a single bit of advice.<br><br>Furthermore -- which house would I, for instance, be in? I write heaps. I&#39;m The Walking Encyclopaedia of the PPC. I write decent Quenya and have <a href="http://huinesoron.webs.com/Netilardo/index.htm">a site for that</a>. So should I be in Kind Word and a Grave, Darjeeling, or Parmandili? Or all three, and render the concept superfluous?<br><br><hr>
<br>So much for &#39;pointing out problems&#39;. How about some solutions, huh, hS? Gods of all stars, all you ever do is whinge! Do you think just because you&#39;ve been here since before mankind awoke you can just put everyone down? Be constructive for once, ya grumpy old elf!<br><br>Well, never fear, me: I <i>do</i> have some suggestions.<br><br>-I already said I&#39;d suggest rejigging the houses. I say we merge to make Grave and a Two-by-Four (or whatever), delete &#39;Fruitbat&#39; and &#39;Tryforce Area&#39;, and consider a new house for RPs.<br><br>-EITHER:<br>--All Big Sibs should have a broad understanding of all the houses: that is, they should be able to write, should have a decent knowledge of the PPC, and know how to use the Board and the IRC. They then set up shop in the house that they focus <i>most</i> on. Basically, a Big Sib can answer any question a Little Sib will ask; the houses are basically so&#39;s you have something in common to chat about.<br>-OR:<br>--Big Sibs in each house should post their names on the Wiki page. They should then be willing to consult/answer questions outside another Big Sib&#39;s area. So if a Parmandili Little Sib wants to ask about the IRC, their Big Sib can direct them to a listed Skull Goblet Big Sib (or ask for them). The best way to do this is probably through Wiki talk pages. The main problem with this version is it&#39;s liable to break down as people leave.<br><br>-I volunteer to make house crests/badges a la Plort, once there&#39;s a finalised list. Hopefully that&#39;ll stop me picking on me. (I&#39;m not sure this counts as a suggestion...)<br><br>hS</p>

The basic idea of Houses 2015 is that they are <i>in no way</i> obligatory for newbies - they&#39;re just something we offer. Given the fairly low numbers of Big Sibs, that&#39;s probably a good thing.<br><br>Obviously it&#39;s a Wiki page, but it&#39;s probably best to discuss significant changes here before making them - if you think any need making! Once it&#39;s all hashed out, I recommend a new thread recruiting Big Sibs to fill out the house lists.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>It seems to cover all the important points, and the main reason I wrote the long bullet-point version was to make sense of what was coming out of the discussion that was happening at the time. It was left a work in progress, so if this is the next step to completion, awesome.<br><br>The only thing I&#39;d suggest is simply getting rid of the old Big Sib/Little Sib List page once this is all up to date.

            <p>It still runs into the problem of the Wiki being quick to go out of date - I mean, looking at the Big Sib list, there&#39;s a whole heap of names who I don&#39;t think are around any more. But it could work, if the Big Sib redirecting the question uses her brain. (Also I should take myself off that list until/unless I feel up to sibbing again)<br><br>Unfortunately, I learnt Quenya through <a href="http://folk.uib.no/hnohf/">Ardalambion</a>, which has a lovely course but doesn&#39;t extend beyond Middle-earth.<br><br>What I can say is: don&#39;t try to learn the vocabulary from the outset. The important thing is to learn the <i>grammar</i>, which is what the Quenya course focusses on (and is also what language websites like Duolingo do). It&#39;s a lot easier to look up a word than to look up a grammatical structure.<br><br>Actually, particularly with Sindarin, I usually have to look up both. The key is knowing <i>what</i> to look up - with Sindarin, I know that the second element in a compound undergoes soft mutation of its initial consonant, so all I need to look up is what the particular mutation is. Also - don&#39;t be afraid to write things down! Notes are really useful for checking back over.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>That might explain why I&#39;ve found my Latin class easier than Spanish (first foreign language) or French (third)— my Latin teacher taught grammar first, whereas my other teachers threw vocabulary at us.<br><br>Also, dangit, you just had to provide a link, didn&#39;t you? :P Welp, I know what I&#39;m reading next.</p>

            <p>For living languages, the ones you might actually have to speak, they tend to teach you the phrasebook. I learnt how to ask a shopkeeper for tomatoes in German, for instance, even though I&#39;m pretty sure Germany has gone the way of the rest of the world and invented supermarkets. But the assumption is that you&#39;ll need to use the language - and to do so in an everyday context. So you learn to ask for directions; you <i>don&#39;t</i> learn the nuances of the Past Historic tense, because it&#39;s not necessary for catching a bus.<br><br>But Latin is different. You will never buy your groceries in Latin (or, much to my dismay, Quenya any more). That means they&#39;re free to teach it to you as an academic discipline, not a life skill. And just like you don&#39;t learn Chemistry by rote learning every possibly compound, you don&#39;t learn an academic language by rote learning the vocab. You learn the tools to make it all fit together, instead. (Or if you prefer: you&#39;ll never hear a maths teacher say &#39;today, we&#39;ll learn the sums of the numbers between 120 and 140!&#39;; they&#39;ll just teach you what + means and let you figure the rest out yourself)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>The AU in which Katniss wins and Peeta dies, and the revolution never happens, and the Hunger Games go on, is interesting. What did President Coin do when she never got her Mockingjay? What happened to President Snow, who was dying then, and who&#39;s leading Panem now? How is Katniss doing? Prim? But the author seems to have completely ignored the idea of 25 years having passed since then, and completely ignored the existence of both Katniss and District 13.<br><br>The premise for the fic--that the tributes for the 100th Hunger Games would be chosen from among the disabled--doesn&#39;t stand up so well. The 100th Hunger Games is a big anniversary; a theme of &quot;Rebels against the Capital are helpless&quot; makes sense, but choosing exclusively disabled tributes doesn&#39;t. And the idea that disabled people are the opposite of Victors is nonsensical; many of the Victors <i>are</i> disabled people. If you want to make the point that &quot;rebels are helpless&quot;, maybe you&#39;d want to reap from nineteen-year-olds who think they&#39;re safe. I dunno. But choosing disabled people isn&#39;t something the Capital would do--not out of their non-existent compassion, but simply because they wouldn&#39;t see it as glamorous enough to make a good show.</p>

            <p>Full disclosure: I&#39;ve only read the first book, and that was quite a while ago, and I didn&#39;t much care for it.The following is largely based on stuff you guys have said here, a brief look through the series Wiki for terminology, and an admittedly piecemeal classical education. If it&#39;s incompatible with HG canon, feel free to totally ignore it.<br><br>---<br><br>These Tribute chaps, chapesses, and nonbinary people of general chapulicity, are basically gladiators. They&#39;ve even got a vaguely-defined laurel crown being dangled in front of them like a carrot before a donkey. Indeed, from what I&#39;ve been able to glean, there&#39;s a whole Fall of the Roman Empire thing going on with the series, from the bread theming being an incredibly laboured reference to the concept of &quot;bread and circuses&quot; to the Capital (i.e. Rome) being this kind of decadent hellscape of flamboyance and sybaritic menace... which might say more than Collins is intending to about the aesthetics of camp, but that&#39;s for another day. You have, every year, one massive balls-to-the-wall spectacle of ultraviolence wherein a bunch of provincial types beat the tar out of each other in a changing environment. I&#39;d like to remind people that the floor of the Coliseum was occasionally flooded so that gladiators could engage in naval battles.<br><br>So far, so Roman. However, there&#39;s a smattering of something else in the mix, and that something smells of professional wrestling with considerably less Health and Safety input. It feels artificial and stereotyped to the nines, which I can only assume is the point. So you&#39;ve got the potential for narrative enhancement in with your gladiators, and if there&#39;s one thing people love, it&#39;s a heartwarming underdog story.<br><br>So you rig it.<br><br>See, the first rule of writing believable villains is that they shouldn&#39;t think they&#39;re the villain. Who does? Therefore, we can assume that the citizens of the Capitol don&#39;t believe themselves decadent petit-bourgeois representations-of-LGBT-stereotypes-to-be-got-rid-of-by-the-backwoods-small-town-yokels-of-the-purported-&quot;Real-America&quot; - er, what were we talking about? Villains. Right. The people of the Capitol are just that. People. Not intrinsically evil or anything like that. Just... people trying to have a little entertainment in their lives. So you have the perfect setup for a &quot;heartwarming&quot; tale of triumph in the face of adversity, so you pick a tribute with an obvious physical disability and you give them... perhaps a little more help than they need.<br><br>I admit, I&#39;m basing this off the whole Pegleg Peeta discussion that happened elsewhere, but it seems like someone with a missing leg or whatever would be exactly the kind of Tribute people would get behind in a narrative about love and honour and eventual, inevitable tragedy. I don&#39;t use the word lightly, either - you can put together a narrative straight out of Greek tragedy by giving our hypothetical Hopalong Cassidy here a bit of extra leeway. Maybe he knows a particular type of terrain from his home district - so you base a few of the earlier rounds off that. Maybe he&#39;s a good shot and a patient hunter - so you put in scenarios where fast-moving combat is discouraged. You create this feeling of tension, focusing on our Tribute, ratcheting it up - will it be this week he dies, will it be this time, oh God I can&#39;t bear to watch it pass the popcorn Darren. You pick the other Tribute to have the final battle, the one who&#39;s also good at this, and you save them for last, and you have the final battle wherein the one-legged Tribute has a definite but not obvious disadvantage to their able-bodied counterpart.<br><br>And when Jake The Peg here loses, what happens next?<br><br>Well, that&#39;s how I&#39;d do it, anyway. Feel free to rip it apart. =]</p>

            <p>Well, hmm. Let&#39;s think about this. How would it really work out?<br><br>First, a few basics:<br>The Hunger Games are manipulated from behind the scenes. Who goes, as well as who &quot;wins&quot;, are both heavily influenced by the people running the games, and their goal is to put on a good show. It&#39;s sadistic, deadly reality TV with unwilling participants.<br><br>People aren&#39;t chosen as tributes unless they make it to the age of eleven. It seems obvious, but it also means that if a person&#39;s disability prevents them from surviving to the age of eleven, they wouldn&#39;t be chosen as a tribute. You would have to choose a disability that would let that child survive, plausibly, in their home environment. If the child is visibly disabled and others can tell they will not be able to work, their parents (or other friends/family) need to be very much on their side, because this isn&#39;t a world that&#39;s kind to disabled District kids.<br><br>Each district has a different culture, and different things seem to be valued. District 3 may allow a physically disabled but intelligent child to survive because they are good with electronics; District 10 may be a luckier birthplace for a mentally disabled but physically healthy child who can care for livestock.<br><br>Some disabilities may be more likely to occur in some areas. People from Districts 9 and 11 may be exposed to pesticides; District 4, mercury from fish. Malnutrition in mothers and children can result in various nutritional deficiency diseases and congenital problems.<br><br>Wherever your character was born, you would have to make sure that they had a way to survive there, whether it was because they had family support, could hide their disability, or got lucky and were born somewhere where their skills could persuade overseers that they were useful despite it.<br><br>When it comes to actually becoming a tribute, you have to assume that the gamemakers have some level of control over who is chosen and who isn&#39;t. Would they deliberately exclude a disabled child--or perhaps deliberately choose them? If this is a disabled child who has survived because they are well-loved and their community has been fighting to keep them safe, why did no one else volunteer?<br><br>Then it comes to how this child is presented to the world. With the Capitol as it is, I would expect them to be presented much the way Rue was--as an innocent for the audience to feel sympathy for. Depending on the child&#39;s temperament, this could be something that the reader could see as an obvious front, simply because this is a child who is already a survivor who has had to be creative to make a place for themselves. They could even try to evade being put into the Hunger Games somehow--perhaps by escaping when people assumed they couldn&#39;t move far enough on their own, or thinking up tricks that others thought they were too stupid to figure out.<br><br>This person might have an interesting perspective on the world--might know better than most tributes that the Capitol is the real enemy. Or they might be bitter and see everyone as an enemy, period. Or they might be good at making friends, and rely on social connections to survive. How they try to survive in the arena is going to be closely related to how they survived in their district.<br><br>Would the gamemakers accommodate physical and sensory disabilities? Possibly. But they don&#39;t miss a chance to be sadistic and to manipulate their tributes. A child who used a wheelchair might be given one to use--but it might be completely inappropriate for the terrain, or it might be rigged to fall apart after a short while. Manipulating the child by tempting them with decent transportation would be easy, and the spectacle of that child trying to jump through those hoops would make for good viewing. For a physically disabled child who can team up with others for protection and transportation, it&#39;s highly likely that the gamemakers will manufacture a situation where the child&#39;s allies have to decide whether to leave them behind. Maybe they do and the child survives anyway. Maybe they don&#39;t. Maybe it leads to drama in the group. It all makes for a good show.<br><br>Would a child with a disability be &quot;allowed&quot; to win? No. Almost certainly not. The reasoning is simple: The Capital wants to prove their dominance to the districts, and if a child with a disability wins, it means that someone who seems &quot;weak&quot; (even though they may not actually be) can beat the Capital at their own game. That&#39;s not a message they want getting out.<br><br>If such a child managed to &quot;win&quot;, or escape the arena, the Capital would have a lot of mud on its face. It would actually be a rather similar situation to what happened when Katniss and Peeta broke the one-winner-only rule, with the exception that the surviving child would be the only survivor. For that child there would be even less to celebrate than Katniss had, since unlike Katniss they would not have been able to save anyone else.</p>

            <p>You&#39;ve suggested a couple of times that the Reaping is rigged - where did you get that? I don&#39;t remember it being implied anywhere.<br><br>Whether a wheelchair-bound Tribute would see the Capitol as the enemy... probably depends on where she comes from, and how the Capitol treats her. If she&#39;s from a Career District, she might well have access to expensive Capitol equipment, like an electric wheelchair, and so actually appreciate it <i>more</i> (consider what a wheelchair made in 12 would look and handle like... yikes); on the flip side, if she&#39;s from a district where her neighbours were wildly intolerant or abusive of her disability, the fact that the people in the Capitol &#39;like&#39; her might sway her, too.<br><br>I think you&#39;re right that the Games would be rigged against her, but not by too much. After all, she already <i>has</i> a disadvantage. So give her a wheelchair that works fine - except for the fact that most Games have terrain other than level ground. What would they plan for when she lost the use of it? Perhaps manipulating her in advance to form an alliance with someone who can help her; perhaps teaching her how to make crutches, and maybe even giving her minimal Capitol treatment to give her low functionality of her legs. (They wouldn&#39;t cure her properly, of course - not after she was shown being selected in her chair - but they might claim they can &#39;only do a little&#39;.)<br><br>I think, provided she doesn&#39;t get herself killed, she has a decent chance of being &#39;allowed&#39; to reach the late stages of the Game. She&#39;s your biggest human interest story, much like Katniss&#39; &#39;doomed romance&#39; angle. And the Capitol wouldn&#39;t want to overtly attack her - that would make them seem cruel, which (the nature of the Hunger Games aside) isn&#39;t really what they&#39;re aiming for. Dominant, yes. Powerful, yes. But they want the Districts to think that as long as they follow the rules, they won&#39;t be arbitrarily attacked - except by the Reaping. In particular, they&#39;re aiming their presentation at the Career Districts - the ones who &#39;enjoy&#39; the Hunger Games.<br><br>And if, by some fluke, she won? I don&#39;t think the Capitol would be at all happy. The Districts are given the impression that victors live happy lives after the Arena, but the truth is far, far different. Katniss and Peeta were forced to live a lie; Haymitch&#39;s family were killed, theoretically because of his embarrassing win; Chaff took to drinking; the Morphlings became drug addicts; Finnnick was made a prostitute; Johanna&#39;s family were killed because she refused to become one. The victors are still tools of the Capitol, even after they win: they either do as they are told and in some way submit to the Capitol&#39;s power, or they are punished.<br><br>So what would happen to our wheelchair-bound victor? Well, any use of her legs she had would be taken away, for starters. Depending on how she won, her family might die in a &#39;freak accident&#39;; they seem to like that trick. She&#39;d probably be brought back to the Capitol regularly, theoretically as a party guest, but basically as a freak show for the Capitol&#39;s citizenry. She would <i>probably</i> escape being sold for sex, at least; they&#39;d be focussing on her &#39;innocence&#39; rather than her attractiveness (whether she had any or not).<br><br>She could probably have a decent life by playing up to the Capitol: turn on the wide eyes, and tell everyone how wonderful it all is. She might even eventually get proper treatment. She could probably grow old in comfort after that.<br><br>And then you throw in the twist. Make her name Margaret, make her from District 4, give her a stroke at around age 75, and you can have her volunteer in place of Annie in the Third Quarter Quell. Surprise! It&#39;s Mags. :D (Heck, according to the book, Mags even uses a walking stick before the Games...)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>It&#39;s the reason Katniss is so afraid of having children. She knows that if she did have a child, that child would probably end up in the Games--that the Reaping would be rigged for maximum drama. She notes that the children of victors are in the Arena far too often for it to be chance.<br><br>I don&#39;t think the Reaping is *always* rigged. They wouldn&#39;t usually have a reason to rig it.

            <p>(and seriously, that sounds amazing), if she was from District 4, a known Career District, she&#39;d likely be passed over in favor of healthier volunteers. Not to mention, if she was wheelchair-bound, why would she be taught to fight? And, uh, how? I&#39;m fairly sure all fighting styles would rely on some sort of maneuverability, which isn&#39;t really possible in a wheelchair.</p>

            <p>Remember, Mags is 80 by the time of the 75th Hunger Games; the wiki suggests she participated somewhere in the 10th-13th. That&#39;s probably a long time before the Career concept emerged - heck, at that point, her parents were probably members of the losing army! The early Hunger Games would have been brutal and ferocious: an explicit show of the Capitol&#39;s power.<br><br>But it&#39;s been a quarter of a decade. There are children in the Reaping who weren&#39;t born at the time of the war. The system is in the middle of changing: the Capitol is starting to view the victors as novelties, not enemies. In District 2, the rising generation actually <i>likes</i> the Hunger Games, making them the first Career District - and the Capitol has made a big deal of the fact that last year&#39;s victor in 2 has just volunteered to become a Peacekeeper. Where the previous Games were basically fenced-off areas of the wilderness, this year has seen the appointment of the first Gamemaker, and the Capitol&#39;s networks are vying for the right to air the footage - not as a war memorial or act of gloating, but as entertainment. They&#39;ve even gotten permission to interview the Tributes in advance of the Games...<br><br>As to fighting... well, again, this is an era when the Capitol&#39;s hold on the Districts&#39; minds is still precarious. I suspect alliances were a lot more popular in those days, particularly since the arenas were much more lethal. So she probably gets carried a lot. ;) That also ties in with what we know of Mags, since she doesn&#39;t do any fighting - but she can make a fish-hook out of anything. So the other Tributes kept her around for food - and didn&#39;t realise that letting her make large numbers of easily-concealed sharp objects designed to stick in your flesh isn&#39;t all that good an idea...<br><br>Obviously this is all off-the-cuff, but I&#39;m pretty sure you could work it. Remaining questions include: would there be a Cornucopia? Would there be a bloodbath, or would people still have the mindset of helping each other against the Capitol? Maybe most of them could be like that, but the District 2 Tributes grab weapons and start slaughtering the rest... or perhaps, since piling <i>everything</i> into one Games would be overkill, that&#39;s Margaret&#39;s reflection on what happened three years ago.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Did the books really say that the Careers <i>like</i> the Hunger Games and that &quot;Careers&quot; is not a derogatory term created by the poorer districts? Even then, Katniss may not be a reliable narrator.<br><br>I got the impression that the wealthier districts had a code of honor. All kids were trained for the Hunger Games. Every year, the boy and the girl who were best in training volunteered to maximize the chance that <i>one</i> tribute  from this district survived. Since somebody had to be the male and female tribute anyway, this doesn’t necessarily say that they liked it. On the other hand, boys and girls who weren’t prepared to sacrifice themselves for the weaker kids could easily avoid this by just not training too hard, so that nobody would expect them to volunteer. That’s the reason why I could never hate Cato and the other Careers. They were still victims, and probably not the worst people to be found in their districts.<br><br>HG</p>

            <p>The Reaping in the Career Districts always took a long time because there was a long process of volunteering. I think it&#39;s safe to say the kids were eager to be picked.</p>

            <p>How do you even type with bunnies? Do you use graphics or something? I don&#39;t think real live bunnies can be used to form letters, that would be inhumane...<br><br>Anyway, what I&#39;m most fascinated by in this discussion (I&#39;m not sure if I could pull off an HG AU in which Peeta dies) is the prospect of a Hunger Games in which the tributes are all physically disabled (as opposed to mentally disabled as seen in canon). It would be interesting to see whether the people running the games (I think there was a term for those, but I don&#39;t remember what) would have everyone compete in their disabled state or have them all fixed up before putting them in the arena. Either way, everyone would have to fight on an equal level, but having them kill each other while still handicapped would be unnecessarily barbaric. I mean, it was suggested that the Capitol folk would throw an epic collective spit-fit if Prim - a 13-year-old girl - was tortured just to give the jabberjays something to torment Katniss with.<br><br>Also: I wonder what Hunger Games minis would be? Mini-muttations or some kind of variant on mockingjays?</p>

            <p>Yes, yes I did.<br><br>Peeta is, of course, an amputee in the 75th hunger games, and walks with a cane at least initially to help keep his balance with his prosthetic leg. His disability slows him down and Finnick carries him sometimes--but I did notice they let him keep the prosthesis. I&#39;m not sure now whether or not it was attached permanently.<br><br>Though I haven&#39;t seen the movies, it seems after some research that Peeta&#39;s leg was also forgotten by the producers of the movie, who decided to reduce the severity of the infection so that Peeta never lost his leg at all.</p>

            <p>We know the Capitol has high-enough bioengineering to fix pretty much any problems, assuming I remember Book 3 well enough. And I don&#39;t recall any handicaps of any kind in the Districts. I, uh, kind of wonder whether the government practiced euthanasia on that score. And, for that matter, on people with serious injuries...<br><br>I also don&#39;t recall any working-age men being housebound in District Twelve, which... well, it&#39;s a <i>coal mine</i>. There ought to be a massive population suffering from things like miner&#39;s lung, unable to physically go into the mines no matter how much they&#39;re flogged. Yet I can&#39;t remember it being there. Again: high-end wild nanotech, heavy genetic engineering, or euthanasia?<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Mostly since (in District 12, at least), people were forced to rely on local healers like Katniss&#39; mother for their medical needs... then again, it&#39;s possible those people just flat-out died on their own, no interference needed.

            <p>First of all: Movie adaptations are problematic. Movie producers don&#39;t really think about the prevalence of disability in real life, nor do they hire enough disabled actors, even in crowd scenes. The fact that the people in the movies are practically all non-disabled is an artifact of Hollywood.<br><br>There are, however, disabled people in the books. Katniss&#39;s mother is the most notable one I can think of, with her severe depression. Using that as an example, I conclude that in the poorer districts, disabled people are cared for and supported by family--and, if they don&#39;t have family, become homeless and quickly die because they cannot work.<br><br>Another thing you guys might be forgetting: The Reaping is often rigged. Would they choose a disabled child, or would they fudge it? That depends on which option made for good drama.</p>

            <p>Basically, a dissertation - also called &quot;thesis&quot; - is this really big paper you write when you near the end of a degree (Master&#39;s for sure; not sure if you do it for BA). Part of it is defending your claims before a committee. The details differ between places, disciplines, etc.</p>

            <p>A thesis is meant for a Master&#39;s degree, and a dissertation is for a doctorate. But Des is right - both of these DO require a presentation/claim defense in order for you to get the degree.</p>

            <p>Overall, good job. Letting most of the the characters get assimilated back into canon was a nice idea, especially considering they didn&#39;t really do much. I must say, I&#39;m impressed the fic recognized that albinos have vision problems. But, blunde hair? Bwzuh?<br><br>A few nitpicks:<br><br>1) <i>“You don’t see me that much after all, don’t you?”</i> The second &quot;don&#39;t&quot; should be &quot;do&quot;.<br><br>2) <i>“Geez, at least this author’s admitting that they’re a moron.”</i> Straying into bashing territory here.<br><br>3) <i>A young man with ashy blonde hair</i> That should be &quot;blond&quot;, not &quot;blonde&quot;.<br><br>4) <i>If it weren’t for the state of him, I’d be getting a bulge in my pants right now,” he whispered.</i> And then a moment later he&#39;s embarrassed by E.V.L. asking if he likes Peeta. Um, consistency? Also... well, maybe there&#39;s a more tactful way to phrase that? Unless Rayner really doesn&#39;t care about making references like that, but it just struck me as unnecessarily crass.</p>
