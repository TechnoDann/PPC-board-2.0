            <p>So, about a week ago, I began set up a site I intended for everyone to post various PPC stories on, without fear of takedowns or them getting lost. I have set up said site, and am now looking for ideas on what I should add to it, particularly how I should keep people who do not have permission yet from posting stories.<br><br>Thanks in advance for any suggestions.</p>

            <p>While your enthusiasm for the PPC is admirable, I have some qualms about this. Actually, I pretty much have the same concerns Huinesoron did when he posted in your <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=270717;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">previous thread</a> regarding takedowns.<br><br>First off, we have a place to post stories that are in danger of falling through the cracks. <a href="http://plotprotectors.tripod.com">The Lost Tales</a> does what it needs to do pretty well. Unless you can think of a major reason why said site isn&#39;t up to snuff, I&#39;m not really seeing a reason to replace it at this moment in time.<br><br>Secondly, you are very new. As hS said:<br><i>&quot;I&#39;d love to think you&#39;re going to stick around for decades to come, but there&#39;s only a handful of people here who&#39;ve made it through the last decade. So if one person sets themselves up as the host for all PPC works, what that&#39;s likely to mean is that we lose everything when they let the site lapse.&quot;</i><br>The PPC tends to suffer a relatively high newbie turnover rate. I&#39;m not saying that you won&#39;t stick around -- heck, you could outlast all of us -- but as of right now I&#39;m not comfortable letting someone so fresh host PPC stories.<br><br>My final concern ties into the previous one. I assume that, as the creator of this site, you would be the admin of it. While I would love nothing more than to have a proper PPC site and bulletin board with mods and admins and what not, I want said mods and admins to be people with experience. People whose judgement can be trusted based on how they interact with the community. I don&#39;t have that trust with you.<br><br>Again, it&#39;s nice that you&#39;re super pumped to be here. But I&#39;d hold on on launching that site just yet.<br><br>PC</p>

            <p>I have been called many things, and excitable is definitely one of them. But, as for whether I can hold off on putting up that site... I may have gone on a caffeine-fueled rampage and already gotten it up. But, I shall hold off on further developments on this site until I&#39;ve stuck around for a while. If I get really over-enthusiastic again, just let me know.</p>

            <p>What about a registration system?  To add stories you need to register, to register you need to have gotten permission.  Though I do not know how you would go about doing it.  That does seem like the simplest solution.</p>

            <p>I nominate &quot;SHATTERED&quot; (yes, the title is all in caps) by Prin Pardus for the Warriors Archive. Not only is it entirely comprised of OCs, all of them with depth and believability, but the author skillfully takes many viewpoints to weave them into an awesome story. She&#39;s the next Brian Jacques, the way she handles multiple POVs so well. And that&#39;s not even half of what &quot;SHATTERED&quot; consists of! A MUST-READ FOR SURE!</p>

I dunno if there are enough Tolkien nuts around here these days to give this the bump it needs, but I thought I&#39;d give it a shot. In my opinion, it could serve as a textbook for OFUM, and it absolutely deserves a spot next to &quot;Don&#39;t Panic!&quot; and the like.<br><br>All in favor?<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I just read through the mission today, and I must admit that Lapis&#39; reactions are a lot more believable. Good job.<br><br>One comment, though: In the future, please tell your betas before you post so that they don&#39;t end up feeling blindsided. For example, I thought that I&#39;d be able to have a more direct hand in Lapis&#39; dialogue.<br><br>Speaking of Lapis, something seems out of place.<br><i>Upon realizing what she’d just said, Lapis flinched and covered her face.“Sorry, sorry!

Could you please explain it?<br><br><br>Also, there is one error that slipped past the radar:<br><br><i>“<b><u>“</u></b>You said you could travel by plot hole, Lapis? Can you try and get us in there?”</i><br>Extra opening quotation mark.<br><br>That said, congratulations on a successful first outing for RC 333.</p>

            <p>I feel like you did a good job with Cupid&#39;s characterization.  It&#39;s interesting how, on one hand, he&#39;s rejected the central elements of his homefic - namely, the wangst - but still clinging to some of its trappings, such as the drinking.  I get the sense that he feels a lot of guilt for his actions, but tries to hide it behind a cheerful veneer.<br><br>That said, I do agree with a lot of Poor Cynic&#39;s criticisms, especially about the presence of big battles and the tendency to interact a lot with the canons.<br><br>A couple other points - why didn&#39;t the agents use disguises?  Sarah says that they won&#39;t need them because they&#39;re jumping through multiple worlds, but that seems almost inherently contradictory to me.  Surely, because they are visiting multiple worlds, they would <i>definitely</i> need disguises?  In fact, they would probably need the DORKS, so they can switch to continuum-appropriate disguises.  If Sarah had said that she didn&#39;t think they needed them because there weren&#39;t any Sues, that would make more sense, though I might still question her judgement.<br><br>Also, the ending implies that Pit still remembers not only the PPC agents, but the Criminal Minds characters.  Doesn&#39;t that kind of defeat the entire purpose of the mission?  It directly states that Palutena plans on keeping a Milivoj mask as a trophy - that&#39;s canon contamination.  <br><br>Overall, I think your agents could have stood to focus more on the actual Duty, and less on finishing the story.</p>

            <p>Between this and yesterday&#39;s kerfuffle, I can say that I had quite a lot to sleep over.<br><br>Anyway, this response goes to both you and PC. I&#39;m glad there are good things to say about this fic (unlike in that ill-fated Christmas interlude I tried writing once... NEVER AGAIN &gt;_<br>Sarah&#39;s logic was that if the agents were jumping between multiple worlds, it would be harder to disguise themselves consistently, though the DORKS may have been helpful; I could probably chalk it up to inexperience, though. Besides, I wanted to explore a bit of a &quot;Roger Rabbit Effect&quot; in which the animated characters end up in a live-action setting and react accordingly. I could just have Sarah state that there aren&#39;t any singular Suvian characters, though, which leads me to my next point.<br><br>In my opinion, the climactic battle was necessary for one critical reason. How could three inexperienced agents have taken on an entire army of poorly written characters at once? Knowing what Sarah&#39;s done on previous missions, and what Cupid and Lapis are both capable of in theory, one or two Suvian characters wouldn&#39;t be too much trouble, Lapis&#39;s age notwithstanding - though I must note that Ella Darcy was recruited when she was 10, and Lapis ended up in DIC because it would be safer for her to untangle continua than to kill Sues.<br><br>A thousand heavily armed, well-trained, murderous Milivoj, though? No wonder they had to get help...<br><br>Pit and Palutena being aware of the PPC was inspired by the fact that there&#39;s no fourth wall in Kid Icarus: Uprising, and the fact that Palutena&#39;s a goddess helps her in that respect as well. I could change the ending so the Smash Bros. continuum isn&#39;t contaminated, though.<br><br>Concerning fetishes and related topics: All of you have made a lot of good points, more than I can say. As for why the tickling was a plot point in the mission that led to Cupid&#39;s recruitment (and this mission as well to some extent), I wanted to show the repurcussions of Sarah&#39;s past as a badfic character and how they would affect the characters around her, in both positive and negative ways. This not only applies to tickling but also her merciful attitude towards characters in general (her MO is &quot;if they are salvageable and can be proven wrong, don&#39;t kill them&quot;). Cupid&#39;s having the same interest was directly induced by Sarah because he had been recently created and was therefore a lot more impressionable than most characters are. That said, PC&#39;s advice makes sense - putting the fetish content in interludes is something I&#39;ll definitely do in the future, though the brick joke that was the Writhing Mass is too good to cut out of this mission. The whole YKINMK discussion is not something that I&#39;ll jump into, but at least it&#39;s not actively deriding me for having that fetish in the first place (which is something that people have actually done to me in the past, mind you). And anyway, this will probably be the last time I&#39;ll integrate my fetishes into my actual missions, so lesson learned, I guess.<br><br>Overall, this mission could be considered a combination of &quot;testing my wings&quot; and &quot;the great purging&quot;. This was the first time writing Cupid and especially Lapis on a mission and it felt awkward to handle them at first, but I had a lot of fun working with them all the same. In accordance with PC&#39;s final bit of advice, though, my next mission will be much shorter, more consistent with the PPC canon, and yes, 100% tickle free. ;)<br><br>P.S. Lapis sounding more mature than she looks is actually intentional and related to her backstory both as a character and in terms of my own creative history with her. I&#39;ll probably hold off explaining it in full until after she&#39;s been through a few missions, though!</p>

            <p>As always, my reviews contain my honest (and occasionally blunt) opinions. I am not trying to be cruel or mean-spirited, and apologize if I come off that way. It is not my intention.<br><br>First off, your characters didn’t quite sit well with me. Their characterization seemed rather flat at times. I did like that Sarah was being tested, but I feel like not enough was done to stress that through the story. As for the other characters, Lapis in particular felt strange to me. Her speech and thoughts sometimes felt more in line with someone much older than she actually is. Slightly relating to that, I’m not a fan of using agents so young. Fifteen feels like a healthy bare minimum for Action Department duties.<br><br>I didn’t see the need for the action scene in part one. It seemed to be just an excuse to one, have your characters slightly show off; and two, put in another tickling scene (a phenomenon which I will address below). Nothing seemed to be added by it.<br><br>Finally, I really don’t like this tendency for your fics to devolve into massive battles that usually involve canonical characters. I’ve said this multiple times: PPC agents are not soldiers. PPC agents are not James Bourne-esque spies. PPC agents are certainly not James Bond-esque spies. If any sort of canonical comparison is to be made, PPC agents are (at least in my mind) like the original cast of <i>Red vs. Blue</i>: ill-trained, snarky, and stuck in an unenviable position that occasionally involves killing something but mostly involves standing around watching stuff. And we certainly do not get the canonicals involved.<br><br>There were also some little details that stuck in my mind:<br> You have a tendency to overuse the parenthetical aside in your writing. By that, I mean separate one-line instances (separated in a sentence like so). These feel too much like author’s notes. I feel like a lot of those could be either excised entirely or made into actual sentences/paragraphs.<br>  Was the canonical Pit being made aware of the PPC something that happened in the previous mission that I just missed? Didn’t they neuralize him? Canonicals with knowledge of the PPC should be reserved for what are essentially gods. Fourth wall breakers should, at best, only be able to see agents when they are alerted to their presence or, as Roger Rabbit put it, “only when it’th funny.” Otherwise, we’ll be flooded with characters that know about the PPC. We’re supposed to be a secret society, remember?<br>  You have some moments of divergent POV (such as on page 12, when Cupid is getting swarmed by the writhing mass), which can make for some awkwardly phrased moments. Typically with third person, paragraphs follow around one character. When another character acts, speaks, or thinks, you make a new paragraph.<br>   You have multiple moments of telling rather than showing scattered throughout the mission.<br>   Is this supposed to be a specific version of Smash Bros.? I ask because you threw in multiple characters (Master Hand, Crazy Hand, Ice Climbers) that are not in the present Wii U version. Did the author of the badfic do that? If that is the case, it should be marked as a charge. Also, I don’t recall Donkey Kong talking in any canon outside of the CGI cartoon show.<br><br>Finally, I want to talk about the tickling. This might get a little rant-ish, so heads up.<br><br>Back when I betaed one of your older mission, I recommended that you split off the tickling scenes into a separate side story. If I recall my notes correctly, I was concerned that said scenes upset the pacing of the piece and added nothing to the overall characterization of your agents. You have not only ignored that advice, you amplified the scenes. You even made it a plot point in your last mission. And here it is again, multiple scenes buried in the body of the mission.<br><br>I have to ask why.<br><br>It’s all very well and good to say, “If you don’t like this, skip ahead,” but in the case of your missions it could mean missing important story or character information. Putting the scenes in question into a separate fic would both ensure that nothing is missed and that those who are interested in reading tickling scenes may do so at their leisure.<br><br>At the very least, I ask that you remember that the concept of “Your Kink is Not My Kink” can cut both ways. You are free to have fetishes, and you are free to write about them. But keep in mind that everyone else in the PPC may not have such a fetish, and so is less inclined to read about it.<br><br>All in all, I wasn’t blown away by this story. There are too many moments that draw me out of the narrative. I would recommend staying away from big epic missions for the future and focusing on small stories, be they in the field or in the PPC. Get to know the characters. Expand on them. Hone your writing skills. Get outside your comfort zone.</p>

            <p>Also, I find it very clear that you do not share this particular fetish with SkarmorySilver. In fact, you could hardly be more obvious about it without resorting to some sort of angry placard. While I don&#39;t have a tickling fetish, some of my own (and of my agents, come to that) are similarly outré, and I&#39;m sure you have them too. I get that you want them out of sight and out of mind so that you can focus on the agents&#39; characters, but please remember that often one&#39;s likes and dislikes <i>inform</i> one&#39;s character.<br><br>Look, mate, I&#39;m a bratty or uppity kind of sub, depending on who you ask. I disagree with people on a lot of stuff, I&#39;m headstrong, and I get a little unnecessary at times - and it&#39;s at least in part because of my desire to be put back in my place. It feels like a more natural, comfortable interaction to have. Besides that, what about gay people who have to trawl through yet another straight romance (with the inevitable attendant sex scenes - oh, sorry, should&#39;ve edited this bit out) to glean some insight into a character, how they operate, how they love? You&#39;re right that YKINMK cuts both ways, but perhaps a little more understanding would benefit everyone.<br><br>Agreed on the problems with POV though. The sentence structure can feel rather jarring.</p>

            <p>You&#39;re right about one&#39;s likes and dislikes informing one&#39;s character. I will admit that fetishes can be a way of doing so (and I will fully admit to having my own.) That being said, I would feel the same way even if this were a fetish that I shared. My problem -- one that I probably didn&#39;t communicate very well -- is that these scenes seem to be occurring at the expense of the overall story. They slow down the plot and add very little if anything at all to the ultimate conclusion. Their inclusion feels awkward and artificial. At least to me, anyway.<br><br>I would also hesitate before filing said scenes under &quot;characterization moments.&quot; If one or two character have a specific fetish that ultimately informs how they feel and act, then it&#39;s all good to me. When it&#39;s multiple characters across multiple stories with the same fetish, it feels less like a method of fleshing someone out and more like the footprint of the author.<br><br>So yes. My issue isn&#39;t the kink itself; my issue is that the scenes that use it feel intrusive and generally detrimental to the structure of the mission and the quality of the written work.</p>

            <p>I haven&#39;t read many of Skarm&#39;s missions, and haven&#39;t particularly flagged up &#39;the tickling scenes&#39; when I have.<br><br>You say <i>what about gay people who have to trawl through yet another straight romance[?]</i>, and you&#39;re right, of course. The same goes for every other way in which any given reader or writer differs from the &#39;cultural norm&#39;. (And as a side note, given your strong opinions in this general area, I&#39;d be really interested to see you contribute to <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=271038;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">this discussion</a> up-Board.) If you&#39;re interested in something that the majority of people aren&#39;t - whether it&#39;s a fetish, a fandom, or a genre - you&#39;re going to have a hard time finding it to read, and are likely to face some... let&#39;s say skepticism when you write it.<br><br>But on the flip side: most PPC missions aren&#39;t stuffed full of (agent) romance, straight or otherwise. There&#39;s a handful of cases where someone decided to make their agents&#39; relationships an arc plot (I&#39;m randomly thinking of Araeph&#39;s inclusion of the Isaiah/Quen [I think?] subplot in her DTE missions), but even so, most of their missions don&#39;t really cover it. So your hypothetical (er... not so hypothetical, around here XD) gay person will usually be able to read a mission <i>without</i> having to read straight romance, whoever that mission is by.<br><br>And yeah, sometimes people get ellipsis skeptical about single instances, too. I know at least one person was put off by the fact that Agent Kaitlyn is a lesbian, despite it going virtually unmentioned in the mission which revealed it. But I think there is a difference between &#39;this thing shows up occasionally, and it kinda bugs me&#39;, and &#39;this thing shows up in every single one of your missions&#39;, <i>whatever</i> the thing is. PPC missions aren&#39;t about the agents&#39; sex lives, and seeing them pop up constantly can be jarring even if it&#39;s entirely in accordance with your own sexuality. ;)<br><br><hr>
<br><br><i>All that being said,</i> and just to make sure I tick off both of you: I&#39;m not sure that YKINMK <i>does</i> cut both ways the way PoorCynic is suggesting. That phrase has always, to me, meant &#39;... but I&#39;ll respect it anyway&#39;, not &#39;... so don&#39;t make a big deal about it&#39;. It&#39;s a concept designed to <i>allow</i> people to express feelings (and more broadly, non-harmful opinions) that other people might find unusual - not a way to ask them to stop doing so.<br><br>Too many words; gonna stop here.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>You are also right, and I can see that PC was driving for that point as well with the benefit of hindsight. I still think they were being a little harsh with regards to Skarmory&#39;s mission, which is a perfectly serviceable little romp through a fandom of which I know the square root of sweet Fanny Adams, but I can see that if you take exception to something and you see it a lot, then it gets grating. Lord knows I&#39;m no stranger to that.<br><br>Actually, point of order, that&#39;s <i>why</i> I haven&#39;t contributed to the discussion, particularly the bit with SeaTurtle&#39;s, er, dubious argument in it. I disagree with their assessment of the matter completely and I think it&#39;s disingenuous, but I don&#39;t trust myself to go into detail without really ripping into them, and the Board is no place for the amount of vitriol I tend to vomit up when sufficiently roused.<br><br>To paraphrase Huinesoron&#39;s Even Tediouser Day, you won&#39;t like me when I&#39;m surly. =]<br><br>(actually most people here probably don&#39;t like me much anyway but that&#39;s by the by. =])</p>

            <p>Okay. I&#39;ve had time to think on this, and I think I can put it this way without resorting to unnecessary shouting.<br><br>While your population statistics are probably accurate, that isn&#39;t the point. We don&#39;t live in a homogenous world, we live in a multicultural one. There are going to be people from different cultures and with different beliefs in any major city, and fanfic writers have a tendency to gloss over this because of how their brains perceive &quot;normal&quot;. No, not even that - how they perceive &quot;relatable&quot;.<br><br>See, there&#39;s a pernicious idea that needs expunging from the collective consciousness; that only &quot;normal&quot; people can ever be relatable on any level. Oh, sure, the characters may have quirks, but by and large they&#39;re within one standard deviation from what the current society considers normal - which, at present, is Straight White Cisgender Able-bodied Neurotypical Male. This is the image pushed as &quot;normal&quot; and &quot;relatable&quot; to the point where the Ghostbusters remake with Kristen Wiig and Melissa McCarthy got canned and replaced with more Straight White Cisgender etc. Again, the fact that the cast of this was women was only a single point, not that big of a deviation from the norm, and yet this was still cause for entitled outrage on an apocalyptic scale.<br><br>This. Is not. Okay.<br><br>Pushing the idea that the only stories worth telling are about Straight White Cisgender etc. is lying to children, feeding them toxic arse-gravy that will come back to haunt every single generation down the line until we break the cycle. Companies won&#39;t do it (see previous Ghostbusters point/rant, whichever term for it you prefer), so it&#39;s up to fans of the series, and yet people just... don&#39;t. Because they want to write stories about &quot;normal&quot; people in fantastic situations, or fantastical people in &quot;normal&quot; situations. Because &quot;normal&quot; is a set demographic pushed by the all-pervading monolith of Western culture (which my people have to shoulder some of the blame for; sorry about that, world), one pushed on people even when it&#39;s not remotely possible for them to conform to that standard of &quot;normal&quot; or be part of that demographic.<br><br>And frankly, there&#39;s no reason for an American story about Straight White Cisgender etc. people to be the &quot;normal&quot; for, say, India (where paler complexions are a mark of beauty due in part to Western influence). Or China. Or anywhere else that isn&#39;t bloody America. Yet that&#39;s the image of a &quot;relatable&quot; protagonist shoved into the world; J. Random Whiteguy Saving The proverbial Day.<br><br>I&#39;ll end this on the following quote, courtesy of Noam Chomsky:<br><br><i>&quot;All over the place, from the popular culture to the propaganda machine, there is constant pressure to make people feel that they are helpless, that the only role they can have is to ratify decisions and consume.&quot;</i><br><br>We have the choice not to be part of that system; as fanfic writers, we&#39;re already on the outside looking in. We don&#39;t have to make the same mistakes as the pre-existing culture.<br><br>It starts with us.</p>

I can tell that this subject is very important to you.<br><br>Secondly, well said. It&#39;s disheartening to see only stories of a particular type featuring the same old cast running around and doing the same things again (quoting hS again: &quot;straightwhiteman wields sword&quot; or &quot;straightwhiteman falls in love&quot;). It&#39;s why I&#39;m doing my best in my spinoff to integrate as much diversity as possible-- the PPC is a multidimensional organization dagnabit and it&#39;s waaaaay too unlikely that they mostly recruit US/Canadian/British folks.<br><br>My original post was motivated by me trying to figure out why white straight protags are overrepresented. It&#39;s simply a look at the number of potential straight white non-LGBT authors in the US (who will likely only write about what they can see in their mirror): I didn&#39;t mean it to come out as &quot;well, they&#39;re the overwhelming majority so we <i>must</i> cater to them&quot; and I apologize if it did. We really need some fresh perspectives on the table: hell, I&#39;m not even sure if I ever encountered a <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=hapa+haole">hapa haole</a> white-Chinese protag &quot;in the wild&quot;!

            <p>More of an ASM-style rebooty kind of deal with the aforementioned all-female main cast than anything else.

            <p>Because, well, the original is just too much of a classic. It worked in a way that would be practically impossible to top, let alone repeat, regardless of whoever they cast. In pure numerical terms, the original has 97% Tomatometer; this lightning wouldn&#39;t strike twice. <br><br>Do I support the other, all-male reboot? Of course not; I think it&#39;s a very stupid, pointless and damaging idea, and has practically no chance of being good. In comparison to it, Feig&#39;s reboot is merely misguided for the reasons I outlined above.<br><br>In fact, let me just conclude on something I believe about ALL remakes; to me, they&#39;re only worth doing to second-rate films, namely ones with cool ideas that failed hard on execution (i.e. something like Priest or Ultraviolet) because then there&#39;s a good chance of getting improved film. There&#39;s no improving a classic, and deciding to reboot one is shooting the film in the foot, pretty much deciding to create something inferior from the start.<br><br>The only exceptions to that rule I can think of are The Departed (condensed improvement), All Quiet on The Western Front (where the original was a silent, black-and-white film) and Coens&#39; True Grit (at least as good as the original). However, these are only three films versus dozens of mediocre retreads and outright disasters.  </p>

            <p>Does it really make any difference it terms of having to live up to, and compete with, the original (my primary, and only concern)? <br><br>Hell, back when Spider-Man was rebooted, I at least could understand the rationale of them adapting different arcs from the character&#39;s 70 year-old or so comic-book history that weren&#39;t seen on the big screen before. I guess that Feig&#39;s reboot could do something like that and be successful in its own right; I&#39;m not ruling it out completely. However, I still think that an weaker, less established property would&#39;ve been a better fit, and contributed more to cinema. <br><br>Think back to The Invasion of Body Snatchers of 1979; it was based on a 1950&#39;s film of the same name that was decent but no more, and they made their film so good it became the definite version, and no-one besides film historians now remembers the original (especially since there were two shitty remakes afterwards, further proving my point). <br><br>I think it&#39;s awesome, and if Feig chose a film of similar calibre, he and his actresses could&#39;ve made their reboot the iconic, definite version. As much as we might wish otherwise, this will never really happen with a Ghostbusters reboot, regardless of gender, race and other characteristics of those involved. </p>

            <p>(And do feel free to correct me if I&#39;m misunderstanding you.)<br><br>&quot;Ghostbusters, a slightly campy comedy movie from the &#39;80s, is Deathless Art and must remain unsullied by mortal hands. Anyone who comes at it with a fresh, interesting, or updated take will destroy it, in the action of the reverse Midas; that which was gold, will be remade normal. Woe, woe and thrice woe that this should come to pass, that we receive TWO new Ghostbusters movies in short order, NEITHER of which is exactly the same as the original thing that I really really like!&quot;<br><br>If I have understood you properly, you are skeptical of Sony&#39;s ability to not screw something up. This is entirely justified, especially <i>after</i> the news that they&#39;re funding what amounts to a direct competitor to the planned all-female reboot because of all the whinging neckbeards who decried that girls and their cooties come anywhere near their bloody tree house. What is also a shame is that we know from what Sony&#39;s told us that the all-<i>male</i> reboot is going to be a colossal reeking turd in the modern way.<br><br>Don&#39;t hide behind a front of caring about art, as if a Ghostbusters movie (A BLOODY GHOSTBUSTERS MOVIE) &quot;contributing more to cinema&quot; is your primary concern. It&#39;s disingenuous. You don&#39;t want a remake because you don&#39;t want anything to remove the original Ghostbusters films from your brain. Therefore, I leave you with an anecdote from Ray Bradbury.<br><br>The film version of <i>Fahrenheit 451</i> is an unmitigated disaster. During an interview, Bradbury was asked what he thought of Hollywood eejits destroying his books. Bradbury gestured at a wall packed full of them and said &quot;What do you mean? They&#39;re all here! They&#39;re <i>fine</i>!&quot;</p>

            <p>I was not super keen on the film, mostly because not of the idea, but the cast.  I do not find Melissa McCarthy or Kristen Wiig very entertaining.  So I thought they just would not make it a very entertaining film.  I still would have seen it.  I would also would not have been keen on it if it was an all male cast and starred Will Ferrell and Steve Carell.  I just do not think they are very funny.  Then again it is going to be hard to top the genius that was Aykroyd, Ramis, Murrey.  In my opinion.</p>

            <p>Brief summary:<br>Replacement!Hermione becomes teacher. Emo!Harry is DADA teacher. They haven&#39;t been friends for like five years. A Sue who has been sexually abused by Madam Hooch comes to Hogwarts, is put in Gryffindor. Meets a Sue who looks like Hermione and is a nudist. Mini-Hermione convinces the rape victim to also become a nudist. Then Hermione adopts her and marries Harry. Meanwhile Mini-Hermione tries to give her virginity to Harry. Anyway, then they all become nudists and have naked tickling games with Harry, including Mini-Hermione&#39;s eleven-year-old sister. And that&#39;s mostly the first story. Later on, there&#39;s a sixteen-year-old trapped in a ten-year-old&#39;s body. And she has sex, quite clearly for the author&#39;s paedophilic fantasy fulfillment. Oh, and Mini-Hermione gets violently raped by Death Eaters after becoming a teacher at age 18.<br>Yeah, Bad.</p>

It was corrected to <i>Rennervate</i> in later editions though.<br><br></p>

            <p>Okay, maybe that wasn&#39;t the best way to phrase that question, but let me explain. I love reading aloud, I really do. People say I would be a good pick for audiobook-reading. But I digress... I got a voice-recorder app a while back. These days, I, well, find a fanfic that I really like and then read it while the app records it. Instant audiobook!<br><br>The point is, I got a YouTube account, and got permission from a few authors to put their read-aloud recordings on YouTube. And I found it&#39;s even more fun to post it then just keep it to myself.<br><br>So... If anyone knows a good fanfic, or has a good fanfic, that you would fancy me reading and posting for more fame, let me know!<br><br>Just to be clear, this is a totally free thing, no payment required, no catches. I only need the author&#39;s permission to post the recording. It&#39;ll be easier if it comes from a fandom I know.</p>

            <p>Back in the good ol&#39; days (about seven years ago now, when I first joined the PPC) there were some occasions where there&#39;d be maybe three, four, five or more missions posted a day. And they all got attention. The more obscure the fandom/badfic, however, the less likely it is there are going to be masses of comments. Please don&#39;t ever feel offended just because someone else&#39;s mission got more attention than yours, <i>especially</i> if they are known to be taking on a Legendary Badfic in a massive fandom.<br><br>Very few of my missions ever got more than a few comments, but I always did them for the satisfaction of taking down a Sue, or occasionally slashwraith, that really cheesed me off rather than being praised for it. I&#39;m not meaning to be preachy or anything here, but it seems like that might be a good way to think about missions. It&#39;s why we&#39;re here, after all, and our Agents certainly don&#39;t do it for the praise from Upstairs. XD</p>

            <p>Well, one of the reasons for a lack of diversity in fanfiction is because of the already-present lack of diversity in the fandom being written about. Not everyone makes OCs *gasp* and work instead with what they&#39;ve been provided. If there isn&#39;t any diversity in the original work, what are you going to do, change the characters from their canon selves?  It really seems like this was written more for original works instead of fanfiction.</p>

            <p>The article reads more like a multi-element writing guide than one particular thing, so you kind of need to break it down section-by-section. I suppose the intro is basically about why minorities in fan fiction matter (see below for my take on the subject, the author doesn&#39;t really go into as much depth about <i>why</i> *ism in writing is bad and where it comes from), and some of the basis for it (that American culture is saturated with *isms, a statement I can certainly get behind).</p>

            <p>Fanfiction is great because we can write <i>anything</i> without publishers and editors breathing down our necks, forcing us to conform with what&#39;s considered &quot;normal.&quot; So how come we don&#39;t try to write more diverse characters/stories/worlds? Sure, we might get some things wrong when trying to write about characters who differ from ourselves, and when we do mess up people are totally gonna call us on it, and it&#39;ll suck—but that&#39;s okay! Criticism is how we learn to be better. So, as long as you&#39;re making an honest effort and doing your homework to avoid stereotypes, why not go for it?

            <p>Let me begin by saying that there were a number of things about this article that I found worthy of either praise or criticism, but that aren&#39;t relevant to its focus on fanfiction and instead address broader and somewhat more incendiary topics. Other than mentioning that I find the very heavy &quot;Tumblrese&quot; in which the article is written both constantly aggravating and a bit difficult to fully comprehend (meaning I might be missing or misunderstanding a little of what was actually <i>said</i>), I won&#39;t be addressing them here.<br><br>The first thing I noticed is that the article does not really address issues relevant to fanfiction specifically:<br><br>For one thing, it doesn&#39;t deal with the fact that a <i>lot</i> of fanfiction has a highly nonhuman cast (I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever written anything with a more than 50% human character list) or is set in a world completely divorced from our own, opening up a whole host of questions even <i>I</i> can&#39;t immediately answer about how our concepts of &quot;diversity&quot; and &quot;representation&quot; would apply. Should authors include black Elves? Transgender turians?<br><br>Second, the author doesn&#39;t really address one of <i>my</i> big questions when it comes to *isms in fanfiction- to what degree we should be &quot;true&quot; to the demographics of the setting we are working in. That question has a lot of dimensions that, again, I don&#39;t have good answers for: What if the setting would just naturally be very homogeneous by many of our standards? What if it&#39;s a setting that fully acknowledges some sort of bias exists within it? What if it&#39;s a setting like Original Trek, one that tried to be more egalitarian in its day but missed a few things?<br><br>Without addressing questions like those above, this reads more like a general writing guide for making your work less *ist, and I think it&#39;s a reasonably good one. Most of it is stuff I&#39;ve seen before, but I do particularly like the addition of &quot;don&#39;t make this a PSA&quot;, &quot;what am I getting wrong?&quot; and &quot;how to take criticism&quot; sections. I would also like to see less focus on &quot;representation&quot; and more on making the minorities you include actually <i>equal</i>, but then we&#39;re getting into the external issues I said I wouldn&#39;t talk about.</p>

            <p>But (and I&#39;m going to sit firmly in Middle-earth for this) you can have black Gondorians - there&#39;s historical relations between northern Harad and southern Gondor. You can have transgender elves - no, <i>Tolkien</i> would never have written it, but the same social, genetic, environmental or whatever factors which lead to people feeling their assigned gender is incorrect would still exist even among the Elder Children of Iluvatar. You can have hobbits in wheelchairs (juuuuust about, though I&#39;d suggest looking up what people used before they were invented) and Rohirrim with Down&#39;s Syndrome. You can have gay dwarves - heck, given the comments about how, even with the massive minority of women in dwarven society, some females still didn&#39;t get married, you could even argue that lesbian dwarves are explicit canon. You can have black Maiar, and poverty-stricken Numenoreans, and Orcs with miner&#39;s lung, and Arnorian single mothers, and Doriathrin orphans, and... honestly, the list just goes on and on.<br><br>So no, Tolkien&#39;s world doesn&#39;t justify black Elves. But it doesn&#39;t justify everyone you meet being exactly like the protagonists of the books, either. Middle-earth is a <i>world</i> - and worlds aren&#39;t homogeneous.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>There&#39;s nothing stating we <i>can&#39;t</i> have transgender Turians. It certainly wouldn&#39;t be out of place in a Bioware world.<br><br>Plenty of fandoms have the possibility for more diversity, and if you look hard enough you can find the writers writing fanfiction just because they want to see that diversity represented. Honestly, it&#39;s worse to me when you see stuff like writing Katniss as white, or ignoring the canonly gay Transformers characters in favor of making them straight.

            <p>I 100% agree with this article but I have just one thing to say with regards to the following quote:<br><br>&quot;<i>Because the world around us has made every effort to whitewash our brains, we tend to gravitate toward characters who are, you guessed it, straight, white, cisgender, able-bodied men. This is the character at the <s>center</s> <b>centre</b> of the story that we’re supposed to identify with and cheer for, not because we actually have anything in common with him, but because he is the &#39;Everyman&#39;, the default, normal. Oh, and look, all his friends are also straight, white, cisgender, able-bodied men, except for his one non-white buddy, who is there to dispense ethnically humorous wisdom, and the solitary straight, white, cisgender, able-bodied woman who functions as the Sexy Lamp - I mean, Love Interest.</i>&quot;<br><br>This is an incredibly American-centric worldview. Is it really a big surprise that authors from a majoritarily white country write about straight white people? About <a href="http://www.indexmundi.com/united_states/demographics_profile.html">80%</a> of the US population is white-- along with 13-ish% black and 4.43% asian. Furthermore, the Williams Institute reports that <a href="http://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/Gates-How-Many-People-LGBT-Apr-2011.pdf">3.5%</a> of the US population is LGBT (with the T component only being 0.3% of the total population). These two factors combined effectively make the straight white person the most statistically average (hence &quot;normal&quot;) person in the US: assuming constant LGBT spread across all ethnicities, that&#39;s over 246 million straight white people in the US-- 77.2% of the population.  <br><br>It&#39;s not so much whitewashing as just simply Americans writing stories about the biggest demographic. When you start taking into account the authors&#39; social class (because exactly <i>who</i> is given the opportunity to become published writers: the poor or the rich? Remember how wealth is divided in the States...) the statistics start leaning even more heavily towards straight white people. Also considering that the other major source of English media is Europe-- where white people <i>come from</i>-- it&#39;s not surprising that we&#39;re constantly surrounded by that demographic.<br><br><br>That being said, the article is bang on the money when it comes to the ethnic sidekick character and the cardboard cutout women. Seriously guys: pull yourself together and write some quality characters. <br><br>Diversity is awesome-- that&#39;s why I decided to write about the PPC&#39;s Infrastructure and Security departments. I want to show more non-Commonwealth/US agents from all walks of life working in the PPC; something that is difficult to do if you&#39;re only writing about one or two agent teams in particular.<br></p>

            <p>I&#39;ve spent all day trying to come up with a response to this, and especially to [EvilAI]UBEROverlord&#39;s reaction, and to be honest I still haven&#39;t managed. Therefore, I&#39;m just going to write words and hope something coherent comes out, because I can&#39;t let this go without... yeah, opposition.<br><br>The purpose of writing fiction is to expose your readers to something new. That&#39;s half of what we complain about in badfic: the fact that they <i>aren&#39;t</i> doing anything new, just telling the same old stories over and over. And when that happens in terms of, say, genres - when <i>Twilight</i> was successful, say, and the bookshops suddenly filled with supernatural teen romances with artsy black covers - we get annoyed. The most recent one I&#39;ve noticed is &#39;dystopic teenagers&#39; - there&#39;s at least three recent movies about that one (<i>Hunger Games, Divergent, The Maze Runner</i>), and of course we&#39;re always going on about how all the movies are remakes and pointless sequels.<br><br>My point is, we tend to agree that doing that is bad. A writer has a responsibility to tell a new story - to show their reader something <i>different</i>. Whether it&#39;s genre, or plot, or character, you don&#39;t want to see them just reusing the same ones over and over. You want them to think of - and show you - something <i>else</i>.<br><br>So... why are you trying to give people a pass when they do exactly that over race, or sexuality? If all books are &#39;straightwhiteman wields sword&#39; or &#39;straightwhiteman falls in love&#39;, how is that different from them all being &#39;postapocalpticteen is a gladiator&#39; or &#39;postapocalypticteen is segregated&#39;?<br><br>EAUO hit it on the head by using the word &#39;provincialism&#39;. Writing only your own cultural norm reflects a blindness to the world as a whole; it comes close to outright <i>rejecting</i> the overwhelming variety of stories you could tell, in order to keep safely in your comfort zone; and it deprives your <i>readers</i> of the chance to expand their own worldviews. The most powerful way to help people accept difference - which is <i>the biggest problem in the world today</i>, and I say this as a resident of a constituency which stands a serious chance of voting in a <i>far-right nationalist party</i> to government, good grief - is to simply show them that the &#39;different&#39;... ain&#39;t all that different.<br><br>And that, I think, approaches what I&#39;m trying to say.<br><br>hS<br><br>(&#39;But all your agents are-&#39; Yeah, y&#39;know what? My agent who is <i>named after me</i> is gay, despite my being nothing of the sort. I&#39;m <i>doing</i> this, not just saying it)</p>

            <p>When you write, you want to write new and exciting; bold and fresh.  Keep the reader on their toes with a story that isn&#39;t bland or mundane with the similar and used.  Adding diversity in your characters can do that... provided you know what you&#39;re doing.<br><br><i>Write for the story&#39;s sake</i> is one of my mantras.  I&#39;m currently working on both Star Wars and a Harry Potter fanfictions.  (No worries, I&#39;m keeping them well away from any of the main canon plots or characters.)  Both main characters are women.  One is manic-depressive.  The other is high-anxiety.  <br><br>While I think these traits add an extra dimension to the story in giving them struggles to fight and overcome, I don&#39;t add said traits in for the sake of having them.  It works for their backgrounds, because, honestly, if they <i>didn&#39;t</i> have these issues from where they came from then the characters would be less believable.<br><br>I think writing based on cultural norms isn&#39;t harmful, but only if <i>you&#39;re writing for believability</i>.  Having a tribe of Ewoks on the planet Kashyyyk like it&#39;s really NBD will throw everything into disarray, and, from what I can tell, is one of the many continuum issues we resolve in our missions.  <br><br>Same thing with human cultures.  Write to include diversity, but keep it withing socially normative expectancy.  If you go against said expectancy, <i>explain how this came to be</i> so it doesn&#39;t throw the reader through a loop and out of the story.  You have a black Moslem living in a Augustinian convent in the 14th century?  Tell (through the story, not as an aside) why/how this came to be, because, for those monks, a black Moslem in a convent is not the norm.  <br><br><i>Stay away from completely unbelievable situations</i>.  <br><br>Probably rambling at this point, but I hope I&#39;m at least being understood.  I think diversity is good, but I favor believability more.  If done in good taste and without smacking the reader over the head with blatant diverse overtones  for the <i>sake</i> of being diverse, and not not actually tell a story (unless that was the <i>point</i> of the story), shakes me out of the narrative and, TBH, annoys me.  <br><br>Cheers.<br><br>~Jas&#39;</p>

            <p>I was not making a judgment on whether or not keeping with the majority demographic was good or bad.  Merely remarking that just because someone&#39;s main character is Straight White person is not bad in and of itself.  It does not mean the writer is racist, subscribes to some kind of provincialism, or what have you. Just merely that it is not inherently bad nor is it inherently good either.<br><br>The way I see it is when writing a character you want aspects of two things.  First you want to be able to relate at least partially to your character or else it will be truly hard to get into their mind, their motivations, etc.  I want to be clear, this does not mean self-inserting yourself as your character.  But each character, in my opinion, if well written still contains a part of the author.  Be it the author&#39;s fears, or dreams, or even the strange verbal tic.  The other thing is that you want to have your audience relate to your character, make them care about what happens to him/her, that is what drives conflict and will make the ultimate fate (whatever that may be) hit harder, resound longer, etc.  The use of the majority demographic is just a way to do that easily.  A truly talented author could make people relate to the character without that, but just because it is easy does not mean it is bad.<br><br>You do not need to reinvent the wheel all the time.  Tropes exist for a reason.  They are tools.  The majority demographic approach (in my opinion) is much the same.  A tool.  It is what you do with the tool that determines skill not just using it.</p>

            <p>Namely what, really, minority characters are supposed to <i>add</i> to a work? I agree that it&#39;s incredibly provincial and a bit condescending to assume that people won&#39;t be able to identify with a character unless that character shares whatever element of their demographic makeup. But I also think that minority characters <i>can</i> act as role models that can help convince minority readers that they can be whatever the characters are too.<br><br>I never liked diversity for diversity&#39;s sake because it implied that there&#39;s something fundamentally, irreconcilably <i>different</i> about the minority in question- that they are being given a minority demographic not because they are <i>people</i> who contribute by their character, but because they carry that inextricable &quot;minority-ness&quot;.<br><br>I want characters in stories to properly reflect the demographic distribution of wherever the world is set (and partially the outside world too), <i>and to treat minority characters just like non-minority characters</i> because it shows that the world created by the author, and the author personally, are not *ist, and saves me from that vaguely queasy feeling I get when I read, say, Lovecraft, and realize the whole thing is subtly suffused with an ideology completely antithetical to my idea of what is even <i>good</i> in the world.<br><br>I&#39;m not directing this at any particular other response here, as it mentions issues brought up in all of them.</p>

            <p>That is more or less what I was trying to articulate.  And I would agree that demographic of the universe the story resides in should be represented.  I would not go so far, however, as to say it should reflect the real world&#39;s demographics.  If it makes sense in the context for it to do so then absolutely, but if it does not, then it really is just another form of diversity for diversity&#39;s sake.  </p>

            <p>In a world that has humans but is not directly related to Earth in any way (like Middle Earth), I do still think it&#39;s a good idea to include some or all of the real Earth&#39;s demographic makeup because of the extra investment of the author in the worldbuilding process. In that case, the makeup of the world becomes something the author controls and hopefully has reasons for.<br><br>Seeing minorities not included in such a world is usually enough to create the <i>suspicion</i> (not confirmation, but enough to bring the uncomfortable feeling back up regardless) that the author didn&#39;t include them because the author had some sort of bias against them.<br><br>Note that simple representation does <i>not</i> help with this- indeed, if minorities <i>are</i> included in such a world but subject to the same stereotypes as in ours, it makes it much <i>more</i> likely that the author is biased.</p>

            <p>I think it gets to some of what I have been trying to weave through in all my comments on the topic, and that is the lazy writer.  Not diversity can be an indication of a lazy writer, but not necessarily a bad writer.  Take a look at for example the Asari from Mass Effect.  They are monogendered (and lets be honest they look like and appear biologically like female humans) and unless something is very wrong they are various shade of blue.  Now throwing in a red skinned male Asari makes no sense in the universe, and so should not be included.  Was Drew Karpyshyn lazy for not including diverse Asari?  Possibly, but was he a bad writier?  I do not think so.  I also think Mass Effect&#39;s various awards and success indicate that he was not a bad writer.  <br><br>That is kind of my bottom line.  Lack of diversity is a crutch for either lazy writers, bad writers, or both.</p>

            <p>This is the kind of mentality I was talking about:  <i> [O]ur instincts are therefore racist, misogynistic, homophobic, transphobic, and ableist </i><br><br>Just because someone writes a character that happens to be a White Straight Male who is fully able bodied does not make it wrong.  I am saying that might be lazy, but not wrong.<br><br>Ultimately it comes down to this.  You write for you.  If you want to only right about the generic hero that people are accustomed to (like Superman, Luke Skywalker, etc.) you are entitled to do so.  One does not need to include a character like Kamala Khan (Current Ms. Marvel) just for diversity&#39;s sake.  If the author does not with to write a diverse cast that is their write to do so.  For example the semi-controversy that surrounded the revelation of the new <a href="http://img1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20150129232401/marveldatabase/images/8/8a/Thor_%28Female%29_%28Earth-616%29_from_Thor_Vol_4_1.jpg">Thor</a>.  Now this is not the best example sense this Thor is actually selling quite well and has been at least accepted throughout parts of the fandom.  Though there was a definite uproar when she was first revealed because many people saw it as diversity for diversity&#39;s sake.<br><br>That is, in my opinion, the bottom line.  Diversity is all well and good, but it has to make sense.  I think Diversity for Diversity&#39;s sake is just another form of lazy.  It is saying &quot;Look at me!  I have a minority character in a majority role, for no other reason than I&#39;m diverse and forward thinking.&quot;  A viking raiding party would not have a quadriplegic in it, so unless the author explains it well, and adventuring party should not have one either.  It makes no logical sense.  Likewise, it would be difficult to explain an African in King Arthur&#39;s Court.  It can be done.  Bernard Cornwell&#39;s Sagramore is a shining example of that.  He made it make sense that there was a Nubian in King Arthur&#39;s time.  It was not diversity for diversity&#39;s sake. </p>

            <p>I do 100% agree that things must make sense, and changes must have a sensible explanation. I don&#39;t think that precludes making things more diverse just because you can, though. In the absence of a reason why not, you don&#39;t need any particular why.<br><br>For instance, there&#39;s no reason the god Thor couldn&#39;t be female, because deities can manifest differently if they want to, so why not? Loki got pregnant <i>as a male</i> at least once, from what I know of the mythology, so the sky is pretty much the limit. (Marvel&#39;s Asgardians might work differently, I don&#39;t know, but if you&#39;re gonna draw on a certain source, why not draw on all of it, right?)<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>That was perhaps not the best example.  But Thor in all sources of Norse Mythology to my knowledge always appeared as a man.  And not just a man, but kind of what would now be seen as the stereotypical man&#39;s man.  In the Marvelverse it makes sense.  Thor the hero does not exist solely because he is Thor Odinson.  Thor exists as a hero because of Mjolnir, which in the Marvelverse is only capable of being wielded by the worthy.  The issues arose because in Marvelverse Thor exists both as Thor Odinson (Asgardian) and The Mighty Thor (Hero).  Asgardians in the Marvelverse follow standard human biology.  They cannot randomly change sex.  And people were getting confused that Marvel was making both the Might Thor and Thor Odinson female.  Because making a male character female really is not well set up.  The hero though makes more sense, as it all comes down to worth.<br><br>And frankly the argument is moot at this point, because by and large it seems that most people like the Female Thor.  As I believe her comic is outselling Thor Odinson.<br><br>But it was illustrative to show that there must be reason to the diversification.  </p>

            <p>There is, actually, at least one reality where Thor was female and Loki was male and they were lovers. Or something.

            <p>Female Thor is in Earth-616 or the main Marvelverse.  And in the comics there is Thor the Hero and Thor the person.  They changed Thor the Hero.  Thor the person still exists as just an Asgardian.  Mjolnir makes Thor the Hero through worth.  Wich is why there was the Beta Ray Bill HorseThor from I think the 80s and now Female Thor.

            <p>Is this notion that people are incapable of relating to characters who are different from themselves. I understand how it could suck to never see people of your gender/sexuality/race/ability/etc. represented as a hero, but empathy is not limited to these things. Here I am, a woman, and most of my heroes are men. Is this kinda unfortunate at the societal level? Sure. Did it stop me from relating to them? Hell no.<br><br>What makes a character relatable is going through struggles that we recognize as analogs for our struggles, having emotional experiences that reflect our emotional experiences, and finding the inner strength to overcome their obstacles, which lets us believe we can overcome our obstacles. The exact nature of the struggle doesn&#39;t matter. The journey is what matters. And since that journey takes place entirely in the mind, the externals... I don&#39;t want to say they don&#39;t matter, because they do, but I&#39;ll never understand how they could be any kind of barrier. It just baffles me.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>If I was not clear, I was not saying that the majority demographic is the only way to create a relatable character.  I was saying that it is an easy and in some cases lazy way to do it.  It is applying to the lowest common denominator.  There are far better ways to do it than just shooting for the lowest common denominator.  <br><br>I was more so getting at the idea that it is a tool.

            <p>I was just using it as an example.  And I was not trying to imply that you had to be part of the Chinese Female Demographic to write a female Chinese character.  I was saying that for some trying to do that might seem artificial at best, and may even stray into misogyny at worst.   <br><br>It is more of a talent think.  An unskilled writer writing a demographic they do not belong to may come across in a very improper way.  That was more or less the point I was trying to make with this set of threads.  Again it all goes back to the Majority Demographic is merely a tool.  It is how the writer chooses to use it that matters.</p>

            <p>[EvilAI]UBEROverlord seems to be claiming that it takes a &#39;truly talented author&#39; to make someone of a majority culture relate to a character who isn&#39;t. I can&#39;t agree with that, frankly.<br><br>But the other way round - people of a cultural minority having trouble relating to majority characters - I can somewhat see. Yes, you&#39;re right, the externals shouldn&#39;t be a barrier - but when <i>every single character you read or see</i> is different from you in the same significant way, I can see you&#39;d get into a &#39;what&#39;s wrong with <i>my</i> sort of person, then?&#39; attitude. Either in a despairing or an angry tone, depending on the thinker. And when that makes every new instance of a &#39;not-me&#39; character just another brick in the wall of Something Wrong... yeah, that.<br><br>(Obviously I say this as a straight white male with money and a house and children and, uh, basically the only ways I&#39;ve ever <i>not</i> been cultural majority through and through are a) being a geek, and b) being for a time in a small, &#39;weird&#39; religion.

            <p>I&#39;ve overly complicated my original points.  What I&#39;m basically saying is that using the Majority Demographic is neither bad nor good.  It is a tool.  I think it is a tool of a lazy writer, appealing to the lowest common denominator.<br><br>Rereading what you said I claim to be saying I realize I really over-complicated things.  What I am saying is that a talented author can make anyone relate to their character regardless of majority, minority, etc.  What I am saying is an easy way to make character relatable in some capacity is to pander to the lowest common denominator.  At a minimum the reader (presumably in the majority) can say, &quot;That character looks sort of like me.&quot;  Instant relatability.  Is that good?  Well probably not.  At a minimum it shows a risk adverse writer.<br><br>I do not personally like that.  I enjoy pushing the envelope when I write.  Be it a specific character, genre, location, etc.  There is a reason my original fiction is <i>sui generis</i>.  I switch the genre up every time I write.  And even in my fanfiction I do the same.  The only active, the term is used loosely, story I am working on at this point in Potterverse stars a (among other things) female American born to French and Russian expats.<br><br>And in the event I further over-complicated things, I will try to make this clear at this point.  Using a majority character is a tool, nothing more nothing less.  It is the idea that one must have diversity for diversity&#39;s sake that bothers me.  As long as there is both a) a good reason for it, and b) it makes sense.  Diverse characters are great.  Ultimately what I am saying is <b>A good writer can make anyone relate to their character regardless of the race, gender, orientation, or ability </b>  and the use of a majority character is not inherently bad.  But it is inherently lazy.<br><br>I hope that clarifies what I was trying to say.<br>   </p>

            <p>Mostly what I was thinking of is the sort of people who insist that boys are incapable of relating to girl characters, which is insulting all around.

            <p>I guess that I forgot a key sentence in my original post-- people take the &quot;write what you know about&quot; rule a little <i>too</i> literally. <br><br>I categorically do <i>not</i> condone the lack of diversity in writing.

I apologize for any misunderstanding.<br><br><br>I didn&#39;t realize that the UK was starting to lean to the far right. It&#39;s happening here in Canada too: our current Conservative government is trying to scare people into believing that there are terrorists lurking around every corner and that the only way to beat them is to submit to the Harper-Overlord. His party has been involved in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Canadian_federal_election_voter_suppression_scandal">robocall scandal</a>, doing pointless things such as renaming government buildings that were formerly Liberal to Conservative party members, removing restrictions on gun control, and trying to encourage US-style pride in Canada&#39;s military. We&#39;re being turned into an annex of the US over here and nobody is complaining!</p>

She could theoretically look like anything, but she picks her forms to blend in and has spent a lot of time in mainstream fantasy, sooo....<br><br>- Supernumerary, let&#39;s call him functionally asexual and aromantic. I almost exclusively play it for laughs, though, so I don&#39;t know if it counts.<br><br>- Ilraen-Aroline-Fothergill, a blue centaur-alien finding himself in a mostly-human society. I kind of think of him as an adopted kid being raised by parents of a different race. Picking which parts of his two peoples to identify with and adopt for himself is part of his arc. Andalites prefer blondes, this is canon.<br><br>- Derik is Pernese, and as such I imagine he&#39;s pretty mixed going way back, but since he also looks like Gerard Butler he&#39;s basically a dark shade of white. Suffers from mental trauma due to the loss of his dragon... maybe sorta-kinda PTSD-like? I dunno. Also straight and a guy.<br><br>- Gall is a HtTYD-verse Viking, but I keep wanting to make her more like a real-world Viking. *shrug* Either way, about as white as they come, and I think straight. If not, she hasn&#39;t told me yet.<br><br>- Nurse Parwill is an agendered white person from Starfleet. Dunno about their sexual preferences.<br><br>- Nurse Elms is a straight white gal who can kick your ass with a frying pan.<br><br>- Nurse Immac is dark-skinned, though not black-dark, and from somewhere on the Disc, though I have no idea exactly where. Four-ecks, maybe? I doubt she could&#39;ve survived to adulthood in Ankh-Morpork....<br><br>- Nurse Mirrad is a Minbari from the <i>Babylon 5</i> universe. Minbari sexuality at least sometimes involves three people, IIRC, but I haven&#39;t explored that at all.<br><br>- Intern Alex is some flavor of Scandinavian, so like Gall, pretty darn white. I guess he&#39;s straight?<br><br><br>I think that&#39;s everybody. Some types of diversity are easier than others, I guess.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

The kids I recruited from my <i>Epic Mickey</i> mission were initially going to be white, but then I realized since I was going to play with Mollie potentially having &quot;ink powers&quot; from her fic of origin, it made more sense for her to have dark skin anyway.  and since she was black, might as well make Ollie black too!</p>

            <p>I know that this has probably been brought up before, but I was wondering about your opinions on real person badfic; for instance, it would be harder to tell if people were &quot;in-character&quot;, because there isn&#39;t really a canon for you to orient yourself based off of, yeah?<br><br>But, I mean, obvious out-of-character things would be noticeable, right? Like, in <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7475968/1/Lover-Dearest-Part-1">this fic</a>, I can tell that every member of Marianas Trench is pretty out of character, even without having met them in person. [cw for link: self-harm, drugs, eating disorders, food references, reference to p*rging, profanity, alcohol mention, ableist slurs (p**cho, cr*zy), hospitals mention, terrible POV switching].<br><br>(I&#39;m not gonna lie, this post was a blatant excuse for me to link to that fic because I&#39;ve read it more than ten times over.)<br><br>(I use they/them pronouns if you want to refer to me and/or call me out for being terrible.)</p>

            <p>Or best guess, either way... Is that people felt that writing fanfic about real people—especially the slashy kind, which is mostly what came up around here since it was mostly Trojie doing the missions—is a bit creepy, disrespectful, intrusive, etc. Since we don&#39;t PPC other kinds of fic when we don&#39;t condone writing it in the first place (e.g. fics in quarantined continua and religious-text fic), it seemed like a bad idea to PPC this kind, too.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>If it would make sense to make a distinction between writing about real people in their capacity as public figures vs. writing about their private lives. People do the former all the time for the sake of commentary, parody, etc., and that&#39;s basically accepted, even when it gets a bit ugly. It&#39;s the latter that gets really weird and gross and shouldn&#39;t be done, IMO.<br><br>Other opinions?<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>is for historical figures doing . . . uh . . . historical stuff.  Like, Sara did <a href="http://agentsara.livejournal.com/4225.html">that one mission</a> that crossed over <i>300</i> with the Battle of the Alamo, which involved Davy Crockett.  It&#39;s a trollfic, so it&#39;s not a great representative of Crockett&#39;s behavior anyway, but my point is, his presence at the Battle of the Alamo is definitely something we know happened, and can handle that aspect of his life in a mission without questioning whether we got him &quot;wrong.&quot;  And there&#39;s always a chance of encountering AU versions of real people in some canons anyway, so . . . This got long-winded, but basically, it would be nice to do some historical stuff, never mind still-living/recently deceased people.<br><br>—doctorlit, who dreams of the chance to interact with Best President Theodore Roosevelt, even if just in a mission.</p>

            <p>Hoover happened to be in office when the Great Depression hit.  It does not matter what else was done, that alone would make him reviled regardless of anything else he did.  I think there is also a question of how much of the recovery was FDR&#39;s New Deal and how much of it was World War II, wherein the US&#39;s factories were put into overdrive, not to mention the draft.  I do not know the full numbers, but I suspect between those two things a great many of the unemployed were reemployed.<br><br>Personally I am more partial to Lincoln being the best President, though there are certainly good arguments for most of the presidents.</p>

            <p>The caricaturisation of real people is touchy, and can lead to a lot of fighting over how they would &quot;really&quot; feel and act.

If you can somehow manage to get the person involved to help write the mission, then go for it. So, if you want to take down that Danny Sexbang and Ninja Brian slash fic you stumbled upon late at night, you better get Danny to approve it directly. Get an e-mail or something.

            <p>It&#39;s a hilarious and perfectly-written example of a straight-faced parody. Brilliant stuff. ^_^<br><br><i>No one seemed to take much notice of him. But then the reverend&#39;s wife stepped onto the scene. She screamed. She fainted. At the sound of her cry for help, the Reverend Dumbledore came running to the rescue. So many so-called &quot;pro women&#39;s rights&quot; people think that Ephesians 5:22-25 is just about wives being submissive. What they don&#39;t talk about is that it also tells husbands to sacrifice for their wives. Wow! Does that sound oppressive? When he saw the man who had gotten out of the car, he stopped and gasped and then he shouted, &quot;Stand back, students! This is Voldemort himself!&quot;</i><br><br>hS</p>

            <p>For two reasons.<br><br>1/ The previous thread upheld the long-standing view that we shouldn&#39;t be PPCing religious fanfic. It&#39;s more trouble than it&#39;s worth.<br><br>2/ Just... go read <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10644439/14/Hogwarts-School-of-Prayer-and-Miracles">the last chapter</a>:<br><br><i>Voldemort covered his ears with the discomfort that heathens often find themselves with when they are confronted with the truth; and he shouted loudly to drown out the word of the Lord, &quot;You&#39;ve been preparing to do this? To scream at me?&quot;<br><br>&quot;It is the work of the Lord!&quot; Dumbledore explained accurately.<br><br>&quot;Aren&#39;t there better ways to spend your time than preaching to a bored idiot who makes fun of people on the internet?&quot; Voldemort questioned hedonistically. &quot;Your Lord seemed to be pretty concerned about helping the people around him. Is that not his work anymore?&quot;<br><br>&quot;How can we focus on helping people; when there are people like you trying to destroy us?&quot; Dumbledore countered astutely.<br><br>&quot;I told you before, that Reddit account is a joke,&quot; Voldemort whined pathetically; but the Reverend shook his head.<br><br>&quot;I thought that might be so at first,&quot; the Reverend commented fairly. &quot;But it was just too realistic.&quot;<br><br>&quot;How was it realistic?&quot; Voldemort inquired uninformedly. &quot;It wasn&#39;t even subtle! I waxed poetic about the sexiness of neckbeards and said that Christopher Hitchens has superpowers. It was supposed to be funny! How could you take it seriously?&quot;<br><br>Dumbledore scoffed; and he replied faithfully, &quot;Like it or not-your little &#39;joke&#39; is what most atheists today are like.&quot;<br><br>&quot;So my Reddit account solidified your conception of atheists as a bunch of anti-Christian bigots who are just angry at God?&quot; Voldemort solicited stupidly; and then he sighed. &quot;Okay, you know what, this has gone too far. I&#39;m sure that most people can tell that I&#39;m not being serious, but if I&#39;m contributing to misinformation and stereotypes, I don&#39;t feel comfortable continuing this.&quot;<br><br>Voldemort pulled an iPhone out of his pocket; and he began to type on it. After a few minutes, he showed the screen to Dumbledore. &quot;See this? I just made a post: &#39;I am a troll.&#39; It is the last post I will make on that account. Are you happy?&quot;<br><br>Dumbledore virtuously ignored the heretic; and he turned to the little ones standing behind his protection. &quot;Students of Hogwarts! This fool will not listen to reason. Let&#39;s save this heathen&#39;s soul!&quot;</i><br><br>Yyyyep. Called it. ^_^ And it was exceptionally well done, too.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>It doesn&#39;t seem so bad at first, but then the questions start raising their ugly heads. Why, if Rose&#39;s family has a tradition of being Gryffindors and her parents were members of the Order of the Phoenix, are they friends with the Malfoys? Since when was Draco ever &quot;sensitive,&quot; and how exactly is it &quot;their time at Hogwarts&quot; that has changed him and not, say, the influence of his Death Eater father and their Death Eater friends? Why the heck is Rose allowed anywhere near Grimmauld Place when Harry, Ron, and Hermione were only barely tolerated? I know what Nargles are, but what&#39;s a Narg<b>el</b>?

            <p>Okay, let&#39;s take a looksee.<br><br>Activity: Well, you&#39;ve definitely been active around here, and you&#39;ve been a pretty enthusiastic participant on the Board, so no problems there. <br><br>Fic to Spork: Wow, that&#39;s quite... quite the fic. I think that could make for a good mission.<br><br>PPC Knowledge: From what I&#39;ve seen (which isn&#39;t much, unfortunately), you seem to know what&#39;s what, but... Where did this Danger Room come from? What are these sphere things Solvig is fighting? It seems to take place in HQ since she goes to see the Marquis when she&#39;s done, but the location itself I don&#39;t recognize. If you want to introduce this later as some sort of training location for agents, that could potentially be doable. I&#39;ll go ahead and say... you&#39;re good to go here.<br><br>Characters: An ex-agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. and a Supergirl clone? Based on the rivalry between Marvel/DC, you&#39;ve already set up for some interesting rivalry between the agents. I like the concept of someone whose base nature is fighting her agent training paired with someone who has no concept of &quot;look before you leap&quot;. You set up a nice potential dynamic for them.<br><br>I remember the thread from a while ago where you asked the Board to help you with Solvig in terms of how overpowered she was, and it&#39;s nice to see you&#39;ve taken the advice on characterization as well.<br><br>Writing Ability (Creative): The prompts were interesting to read and I feel like I got a good feel for your agents, so good stuff.<br><br>Writing Ability (Technical): Here&#39;s where I&#39;m hesitant, and quite a bit. Your spelling is overall fine, though you have a few typos here and there that could have been caught with some more thorough proof reading. <br><br>Your punctuation and grammar, though... Well, let&#39;s look at an example. <br><br><i>&quot;That is not all, give me that.” the Swedish psychiatrist said while she signaled Solvig to give her the sphere, who promptly gave it. “See these chipped areas on the top of the sphere?” the blonde continued while pointing at said chipped areas, “these were caused by debris from the robots destroyed by you.  You must learn to limit your collateral damage.”</i><br><br>You have a tendency to use improper punctuation and capitalization when it comes to starting and ending dialogue. I&#39;ve also noticed quite a few run-on sentences. Not only that, but you neglected to capitalize some proper nouns (&quot;japanese-american&quot; comes to mind), and you have some sentences where words seem to have been dropped, or you&#39;ve used a very odd word choice (<i>Solvig moved herself to Yuna’s side, and neared her face to a few centimeters away from her partner’s face</i>). <br><br>I see you had help from SkarmorySilver in terms of beta reading, but from the sheer number of technical errors, I find it a bit hard to believe.<br><br>I&#39;m really sorry, but I&#39;m going to have to say no. Everything else looks great, so just really focus on cleaning up the technical aspect of your writing and I think you&#39;ll be fine next time you ask. <br></p>

            <p>That Danger Room is essentially a Mandalorian Iron-covered Blast Chamber from the Department of Sufficiently Advanced Technology, Testing and Application Division (the ones that are normally used for lightsaber training [I don´t remember in which part of the wiki I got that information]); that was modified with Hard Light construct generators, like the original Danger Room from the various X-Men continua. <br><br>And the sphere, is just that, a normal glass sphere, that in this case is used for Super Strength training.

            <p>When I create a character, I look at characters I like. I ask myself the following questions after doing so:<br><br>&quot;can this person fit here?&quot;<br><br>&quot;how do they react by fitting here?&quot;<br><br>Then I look at their past: &quot;what was one major event in their past, and how do they look if it turns out differently?&quot; <br><br>And finally: &quot;what can I give this person from my self, without making them a self-insert?&quot;<br><br>These steps are not followed properly in the case of a new writer, who often fails to create a character who fits in with the setting, and instead makes a character that does not fit at all. For instance, let&#39;s say I write a COD fanfic. If my OC is from the future, is Tony Stark&#39;s niece, and is sooo badass that they can floor Soap? Does not fit.<br><br>Another thing that is often tossed aside is consideration for a character&#39;s place in a story. A character is there to interact with the world. It doesn&#39;t matter how good your characters are if you spend so little time on the background and the setting that you can&#39;t tell one city from another. If there even are cities, it might just be &quot;generic location&quot; which is very, very bad.</p>

            <p>(which I&#39;ll get to in a moment), I think one of the biggest mistakes is being too nice or too mean to a character. Either they get all the things in life handed to them on a platter for no reason, or every bad thing to ever happen ever, again for no reason. You gotta strike a happy balance, which can vary depending on the setting— after all, (modern) fairy tale characters tend to get the &#39;happily ever after&#39; more often than dystopian characters for a reason— and make your characters deserve/earn their punishments and rewards. <br><br>As for self-inserts, they can be done well, but the best-done SIs are the ones that are most representative of the author, not an idealized version. <br><br>Lemme drag one of my childhood make-believe selves out for a moment. She was shy, quiet, and liked to read, and was a little bit lazy, which is all fine and dandy until you also take into account that she looked human except for her yellow, slit-pupiled eyes, black leathery wings, spiky black tail, and ability to breathe fire. Did I mention she was half-Hungarian Horntail and hatched from an egg, and Charlie Weasley brought her home as a baby where she was raised as Ron&#39;s twin sister? ...I had weird fantasies as a kid.<br><br>Yeah, no. Don&#39;t go the &#39;ideal you&#39; route. It hardly ever, if at all, ends well.<br><br>Anyway, there&#39;s my ten cents.</p>

            <p>Starting with the powers is a bad, bad idea. I&#39;ve seen it a lot, and the character ends up being pretty shallow in terms of development.

            <p>I would say first and foremost putting too much of oneself in the character.  A character should be a part of you, but not a thinly veiled you.  This by its very nature leads itself to characters that if not outright Sues are certainly Sueish.  But on a related not, too flawed is another very common one.  <br><br>Those are the biggest ones in my opinion.  Though there are certainly others.</p>

            <p>OCs are often based off their creators, whether intentionally or not. Often sues are simply &quot;better&quot; versions of their creators, which is a little sad. A character can be a hero even if they don&#39;t have any powers and talents!</p>

            <p>Especially since it really does not take too much effort to make a character truly original.  Then again I may be over simplifying it.  I personally do not have a lot of difficulty with the characters, at least  not anymore.  Early on that was not the case.  As it was my first attempt at organized writing was a fanfic I wrote 11 or so years ago.  It probably borders, if not strays into, badfic territory.  The OC I created for that was basically a self-insert with Force Powers and certainly Sueish.</p>

            <p>You can find it over on the Pit.  I already posted a link for it on an earlier thread, though that is no longer first page.  I do not know if it is sporkable bad, but it is bad.  The reason is I cannot tell how bad it really is.  Because I know what I have done since then, so by comparison it looks bad.  I&#39;ll post it again because I am still curious to see how bad it really is.  IF I recall it basically featured a Young Teen Super Jedi, a bad three way crossover that makes little to no sense.  And more than a few cannons out of character.  And badly.

            <p>I appreciate what you&#39;re trying to do and I&#39;m glad you&#39;re getting so much out of the workshops. I&#39;m not going to lie: the lackluster response to 4A had me in sort of a funk. Still kinda does.<br><br>That&#39;s why I need to ask the community at large: are you all getting anything out of these workshops? Are they helpful? Are they even being read? Because if the answer to those questions is &quot;no,&quot; I&#39;d like to be made aware of that. <br><br>If nobody cares about these, I&#39;ll stop writing them. I can take the time I would have spent on the workshops and put it towards writing new stories or coming up with more entertaining community activities. Being lectured at through the internet probably isn&#39;t the most entertaining way to spend a day. I just don&#39;t want to make these workshops and have them not be useful.<br><br>I&#39;ve always believed in being honest, so please tell me. Do you not have time to read them? Are the challenges boring? Are the tips unhelpful? Do you find my acting as some kind of expert arrogant? You&#39;re not going to hurt my feelings. I would rather have dismissal than apathy.<br><br>PoorCynic</p>

            <p>I have read your workshops, and saved them onto my computer, so I can access them whenever. <br><br>In particular, the first two about agent building and speech I found greatly useful. The Challenge at the bottom helped me get a lot of scenarios in with Doom/Gloom, and workout some details I did not think of at first with her. <br><br>The mission writing one you made, as well as the on HG posted I am utilizing right now, actually. Me and Miah have a perfect fic picked out (for DBSing, anyway) and are taking that approach. <br><br>While I am not sure my older methods for ficbits (3 yearsish ago), and such, my current style is copying the fic to google Docs, then leaving a comment over every line that sticks out for any reason to highlight the important bits. After that I think on why it sticks out, and write in what I want to comment on it, and which agent would be best to point out the uncanon bit, or how bad something is. After that I try the wisecracks, and looking for those fun, FUN lines that cause silly things to appear via literalness.<br><br>A bit late to reply to all of them, but thank you either way for them! I&#39;ll be sure to save the list for the next mission, if you would like to see it, and also so I can refer to it for the next fic, and so on. </p>

            <p>...the third one actually helped me create an agent. I think I might have already had a bit of an idea for her, but your workshop helped me develop her a lot more, to the point where I have many character notes, a bit of a character study, and most of the set-up for a short mission. Apart from that, they&#39;re just plain interesting; I read 4A, and will probably test out the techniques you mentioned at some point.<br><br>Also, no, you don&#39;t sound arrogant. You tend to bring up things I haven&#39;t considered, actually, and that&#39;s definitely interesting. So yeah, thanks. I&#39;m going to have a look at the first two now.<br><br>You can do what you like, of course, but I&#39;m pretty sure I&#39;ve benefited from the two workshops I&#39;ve read. I just...don&#39;t always have time to comment before, say, the thread drops off the front page. No apathy here.<br><br>~DF</p>

            <p>I actually have seen all of them! And it&#39;s not the third one that helped me create an agent, it&#39;s the first one. As I remember, I read through the other two--I know for sure that the third caught me while I was finishing an intensive language program, so there&#39;s no way I did anything more than read it--and thought they were interesting. I&#39;ve generally been thinking it&#39;s cool that you&#39;re doing these.<br><br>Actually, now I want another look at the one on language/dialogue...<br><br>~DF</p>

            <p>PoorCynic, I&#39;m aware that this is still not what you expect. I post it here before this thread falls off the page again, so that somebody may learn from it. I hope I can finish this and post Part 3 within some more days.(Note: if this weren&#39;t for the workshop, my notes would be much shorter and probably incomprehensible for anybody but me.)<br><br>I skimmed through some of the stories on the unclaimed badfic list for <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=270927;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">reasons</a>.<br><br>Selecting a fic just for its shortness may not be the best idea, but I cannot drag this out over months, so here is my pre-writing process for <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5172794/1/Roses_Visit">Rose’s Visit</a>.<br><br><b><u>Caution!</u></b> I will try to keep this family friendly, but the source is rated M, and we may need to talk about trivialization of sex, violence, murder and child abuse.<br><br>When I skimmed it, I noticed (from the top of my head)<br>- Harmonian theory, which shouldn’t infuriate me when it’s based on canon evidence<br>- Time travel<br>- Character bashing<br>- A wrong birth-date for Rose Weasley, which may be something to work with, and is the reason why this fic, that looks quite unmissionable on first glance, went onto the list of four fics I decided to explore further.<br><br>The first real read through (no notes taken) confirmed all my suspicions and revealed some additional problems. Short look on the questions for reading as a reader:<br>- What works? As far as I remember: nothing.<br>- What doesn’t? Everything, but specifically basing Harmony on blatant lies about canon and throwing Ron and Hermione out of character to &quot;proof&quot; how bad their marriage will be. Also, unexplained time travel.<br>- Are there any scenes that boggle your mind with how bad they are? Possibly Hermione &quot;explaining&quot; to Harry what love is, making him realize that he loves her. But the rest is so bad as well that it doesn’t really stick out.<br>- How are the original characters, if there are any? Technically, there aren’t any, but I’m sure that Rose is a Replacement. And she certainly sounds more like a whiny Harmonian still mourning her defeat in the shipping wars and complaining about everything that sucks in the sixth and seventh book than like what she is supposed to be in the fic.<br><br>Now going to read it again, taking notes.<br><br><b>Outlines and Notes, first draft</b><br><br>(Since there are no chapters, I’m breaking this up by paragraphs or blocks of paragraphs.)<br><br>(1)<br>After the battle of Hogwarts, mourning in the Great Hall. Half-sentence flashback to Hermione kissing Ron, then scene shift to Harry lying on his bed. <br>- I’m not sure how much this will throw the agents around until they realize that this just establishes Harry’s POV and we have seen his thoughts about the situation. If it cannot be played for laughs, they may prefer to enter the fic at the second paragraph.<br><br>(2 – 5)  <br>Harry and Hermione had left the Great Hall and went to their respective dormitories, but they cannot sleep, so Hermione visits Harry and occupies Ron’s bed. They chat for a while. Just before they doze off, an old woman appears in a bright silver light.  <br>- Hermione should be in the Great Hall with the Weasleys. [Check DH, but I’m quite sure.]<br>- H. and H. cannot see the agents arriving, but since &quot;Rose&quot; is a Sue, the agents should hide before she appears. Under a bed across the room from Harry and Ron’s beds? Dean’s bed, identified by the Westham United poster?<br><br>(6 – 9)<br>The Sue identifies as 143 years old Rose Weasley and claims that she used Hermione’s &quot;notes to get back&quot; in time because she wanted to talk to her parents.<br>- No idea what this means. Did Hermione leave her daughter notes about time travel?<br><br>(10 – 16)<br>Rose-Sue begins with the Weasley-bashing and claims that Harry is her father. She talks in breathless run-on sentences, and this spills over to the narrative.<br>- [Reread check: was the narrative this way from the start?]<br>- How does this affect the agents?<br>- Also, a misspelled Horcrux’s (meant to be plural) may give them something to do while they hide under the bed.<br><br>(17 – 18) I have to quote this:<br>Harry and Hermione turned to look at each other; nodded and then turned back to listen to what Rose had to say.<br><br>&quot;Can you please keep in mind what you just did, that talking with out words...&quot;<br>- Does she imply that Harry and Hermione did this in canon all the time, and that this is a sign of their true love? I thought I know my canon, but I don’t remember a single incident where this happened. (I <b>do</b> remember a scene in the third book where it happened with Harry and Ginny!) Unfortunately the Sue doesn’t quote canon lines I could argue with. Must I now reread the entire seven books to see whether she may have a point somewhere, or can I just charge her with blatantly lying about canon and be right because she doesn’t defend her position? <br><br>(18 – 19)<br>Rose-Sue claims that Harry, after seeing Hermione kissing Ron, was so devastated that he intended to commit suicide by Voldemort, because &quot;he had no more reason to fight&quot;, and somehow she holds the Dursleys responsible for this, because Hermione of all people was too stupid and too un-empathic to understand how badly living with the Dursleys had affected Harry.<br>- Canon check: Harry’s thought’s while he walked to his sacrifice. Agent Hieronymus would love to quote them at the Sue, if he finds the time to do it.  <br>- Is this the place to joke about this version of Hermione having the emotional range of a tea spoon? [check exact quote]<br><br>(20 – 21)<br>Rose-Sue claims that Harry doesn’t know how to show love, and that what he feels for Hermione is love, and that he couldn’t stand being touched by people, except Hermione, whose hand he hold every night while she was petrified.<br>- This didn’t happen in CS, so she <b>is</b> blatantly lying about canon. [Canon check: Did Harry touch petrified Hermione once, when he took the piece of parchment out of her hand, or was this Ron?]<br><br>(22)<br>Rose-Sue is foretelling the future now. &quot;In the not to distant future&quot; Rose will be conceived when Hermione and Harry will realise their &quot;real true love&quot; and promptly have sex. Hermione wrote about it in her journals, but she didn’t reveal what caused the big realisation. Harry asked Hermione to marry him. Also, Harry never asked Ginny, somehow she just pushed him into marriage.<br>- Canon check: how old is Rose in the epilogue. I’m sure she should be conceived several years after the battle of Hogwarts. Since this doesn’t qualify as not too distant future, Rose-Sue certainly isn’t the canonical Rose. <br>- Obviously Stupid!Hermione didn’t consider that Ron might read her journal and find out that she slept with Harry. But aren’t you supposed to put your thoughts into your diary, not just a plain description of the day’s events? Why didn’t she say anything about <b>how</b> she and Harry realised their &quot;real true love&quot;? (Because Rose-Sue has no imagination and just wanted it to happen, but that’s beside the point.)<br>- Since we already established that Rose-Sue lies, I suppose that Hermione’s journals say actually nothing about the big realisation, because it will not happen. But since Rose-Sue exists, something must have happened, so the secret that Hermione doesn’t reveal in her journal is probably that she and Harry had sex and Harry asked her to marry him just because a time traveller had told them that this had to happen because it had already happened. <br>- Also, I have some problems with tenses in these notes. We may need a Time-Lord to sort this out.       <br><br>(23)<br>Further foretelling the future, Hermione, following a misguided sense of loyalty and obligation, will disregard her newly discovered &quot;real true love&quot; and marry Ron anyway, because she already promised and doesn’t want to hurt the Weasleys’ feelings.<br>- Being a Gryffindor, Hermione should actually be guided by honour (she’s a sort of knight, right?), and her sense of honour might misguide her in a Victorian way. But I can’t blame her for being stupid here. A time traveller told her that she <b>will</b> marry Ron because it already happened in the future, and Hermione is not as stupid as to temper with history. (Time-Lords, help me!)<br><br>(24 – 25)<br>Only days after Rose-Sue is born, Ron will start to beat his wife. Twenty years in the future, the Weasleys will do nothing to stop Ron when he beats his wife to death, because, as Molly says it, she’s &quot;just a mudblood and therefore [...] must deserve it&quot;. Harry will try to rescue Hermione and will be stabbed by Rose’s evil half-brother Hugo. The Weasleys will make up a story about Harry and Hermione killing each other. <br>- Is Ron’s wife really Hermione? Why doesn’t she hex him to Tibet? Or at least grab her baby and run away? Oh, I forgot, a time traveller told her that she cannot run away, because then the time traveller’s trajeck past will never have happened.<br>- Isn’t it telling that this starts as soon as the Sue has forced her way into existence, and is now able to warp everybody out of character?<br><br>(26)<br>Ginny plans to inherit all of Harry’s wealth and not share it with her kids, so she will cast a sterility charm on Harry before she sleeps with him, and when he is dead, she will send her children, who aren’t Harrys kids, off to their respective fathers.<br>- I don’t understand why Ginny even has kids. Why didn’t she cast a sterility charm on herself?<br>- Maybe she feared that Harry would want a divorce when she couldn’t give birth.<br>- But these kids will still inherit her wealth when she dies. Doesn’t she fear that they, having grown up in such a terrible family, will become evil and try to inherit early?<br>- Am I already writing dialogue for my agents?  <br><br> (27 – 31)<br>Rose-Sue brags about how she crossed the Weasleys’ evil plans as soon as she was of age. Presenting evidence that she is a Potter, and memories of the murders, she had the Weasleys arrested, got the Potter inheritance plus all other Knuts Ginny possessed, burned down the Burrow, and was probably somehow responsible for Hugo being found dead in his cell. Just as an afterthought in midst of this raging revenge, she remembers that she was abused ever since her mother’s death, starting when she was twelve and a half years old.<br>- I hope Evil!Ron had read Stupid!Hermione’s journal and knew that the didn&#39;t – no, scratch this, I&#39;m not going there.  <br>- Although it’s a good description of the Sue’s hate-full character, I will try to gloss over this section, conveniently ignoring all implications that the Sue was not already of age twenty years in the future, and was actually born about seven years after the Battle of Hogwarts.<br><br>(32 – 33)<br>As soon as Rose-Sue has stopped babbling, Harry asks Hermione how one knows that they are in love. Hermione shortly contemplates &quot;to interrogate him later about his treatment at the Dursleys&quot;, and, anticipating to hear about terrible experiences, to pay them a revengeful visit, but then makes Harry answer some other questions.<br>- Really? This is their reaction to the bloody story they just heard? They show no empathy for their abused child?<br>- It seems unbelievable that Hermione is so clueless about Harry’s family, but since I don’t remember when exactly in canon Harry told her about his experiences with the Dursleys, he may only have told Ron. [Further research required. Reread at least <i>Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone?</i>]<br><br>(34 – 41)<br>In an awkward dialogue, Hermione makes Harry confess that she is the first person he thinks about in the morning, and the last person he thinks about in the evening, and the person whose happiness is more important than his own, and for whom he would die without hesitation.<br>- How often were we present when Harry woke up or went to sleep, read his thoughts and didn’t see any of these? <br><br>(42)<br>Actually, Harry believes that he did already show Hermione that he would die for her without any hesitation.<br>- Now Agent Hieronymus would like to quote Harry&#39;s thoughts from DH 34 to him. He didn&#39;t die solely for Hermione, and she didn&#39;t even take the first place.<br><br>(43 – 44)<br>Then Hermione and Harry begin to make out, and Rose-Sue tells them to &quot;save all the sex stuff until three months today at eight thirty in the evening please&quot;.<br>- So realizing your &quot;real true love&quot; doesn&#39;t require immediate sexual activity, and this is all about doing it at the right time so that the Sue will be conceived! She is clearly only there to ensure her own existence by talking Hermione and Harry into having sex at the right time.<br>- Unconventional assassination method: Just neuralyze Hermione and Harry when this is over. If they don’t remember when they should do it, and that they should do it at all, Rose-Sue will never exist, thus being proactively assassinated.<br>- But when do we read the charge list? And I&#39;m not sure whether the neuralyzer even works at Hogwarts. (This shouldn&#39;t be too easy.)<br>- Ha! Confirmation that she is conceived three months after the Battle of Hogwarts. Since somebody conceived six years before they were born obviously cannot exit, Agent Hieronymus may be able to talk her out of existence. After all, the sharp sword of reason is his preferred weapon.<br>- But I intended to gloss over the section that confirms the late birth date.<br>- I know that we shouldn&#39;t interact with canons, but maybe Hermione and Ron can just be talked out of following the time travellers advice by some random people who don&#39;t mention the PPC. Is it also possible to convince them that they should never mention this encounter? At least Hermione understands how dangerous timey-wimey stuff is, and Harry will listen to her. Pretend to be Unspeakables from the DOM&#39;s time branch?<br><br>(45 – 49)<br>Since the Weasleys and the Dursleys weren&#39;t enough, Rose-Sue now bashes Dumbledore and Snape and the names of Harry&#39;s sons. Then she realizes that she is at &quot;the turning point&quot;, implies that Hermione didn&#39;t get her parents back from Australia, and vanishes.<br>- Now I understand Harry and Hermione&#39;s non-reaction to Rose-Sue&#39;s story. It&#39;s the Suefluence. She is on a strict schedule and had to rush this to make all her points before her time is over and she returns to the future. <br>- If the agents didn&#39;t read ahead, they will be taken by surprise, and above-mentioned unconventional assassination methods may become necessary.<br>- Would portaling the Sue to some other place in the last possible moment break the temporal connection, so that she doesn&#39;t return to the future and there is time to charge and kill her? Since we don&#39;t know anything about her method of time travel, I cannot think of any techno-babble that would make this sound plausible.<br><br>(50 – 63)<br>Hermione confesses that all her answers to the questions she asked Harry would be him, Harry proposes, Hermione agrees to marry him, but insists that their children will not be named Albus or Severus. They decide to tell Ron later and go to sleep in one bed, but certainly not indulge into any sexual activities. Next morning, they break up with Ron and leave for Australia, &quot;where they would make sure Rose was concieved again.&quot; <br>- I don&#39;t understand why they expect to stay in Australia for at least three months, but this may be convenient.<br>- I don&#39;t like to introduce semi-canonical sources, but I&#39;m sure that Harry doesn&#39;t have the time to accompany Hermione to Australia and stay there so long. There are still Death-Eaters to be rounded up, the Auror bureau needs every experienced and trustworthy fighter, and Harry, Ron and Neville will certainly not shirk the duty. So this thing doesn&#39;t even need to be PPCed, because it wouldn&#39;t work anyway, and Rose-Sue will never exist.<br><br>Tasks for second draft:<br><br>Find something to do for the agents. They cannot just lie under the bed, not even daring to MST, because the Sue might hear them, until they jump out to charge and kill.<br><br>Decide on time and method for assassination.<br><br>Pre-mission premise and post-mission closure.<br><br>HG</p>

            <p>I&#39;m reading them, and comparing how you write to how I write. I have not done any of the exercises yet, but I do intend to. Except the most recent one, as I already know how to find good badfic for the fandom I&#39;m covering. On the whole, this series is very helpful for anyone writing missions.<br><br>Don&#39;t be discouraged over the lack of response to this last one. It&#39;s not a very tasty topic, while important.

            <p>My next DIC mission is going to take place in the Godzilla continuum, with the crossover being a Sonic replacement as big as the M.U.T.O.s from the 2014 Godzilla movie. I&#39;ve come across a little roadblock with regards to how to handle it, though, and I may need your help on this matter.<br><br>The original plan was for the agents to go to DoSAT and use some kind of special technology to disguise themselves as kaiju - but the problem is that I don&#39;t recall if anything like that is either possible in-universe or reasonable as far as the writing is concerned. The other alternative was to have the agents visit as themselves, but have Godzilla personally kill the Stu once the charges are pressed, but as tempted as I am to use the &quot;kiss of death&quot; that he pulled on the female M.U.T.O., I&#39;m trying to steer clear of having the canons be directly involved in the executions as much as possible.<br><br>My big question, then, is: How do you kill a kaiju-sized replacement, Sue, Stu, or whatever it is that&#39;s threatening the canon? Most militaries are useless against Tohoverse kaiju, and pretty much the only way to get rid of one of those is either through some really crazy ultra-destructive tomfoolery like the Oxygen Destroyer or by having another kaiju dispose of them. <i>Is</i> there a way to kill a Suvian kaiju that doesn&#39;t involve the Big Guy himself?</p>

            <p>As there is of course a <i>looooooong</i> tradition in classic kaiju movies of summoning more of the things to deal with the one you have. Not sure which one would be most appropriate here, or for that matter how many, nor how you would contain your &quot;solution&quot; once it had done its job, but that last one would certainly be a funny question for the Agents to ask <i>after</i> they had done it.<br><br>If that fails, the Jaegers from Pacific Rim are of course designed specifically to do your job, and while there are of course canon-contamination issues it seems like when really <i>big</i> things need to be killed the flowers are willing to overlook that point- I remember one mission in particular where a WH40K capital ship was brought in to glass a Mata Nui knockoff island filled to the brim with Sues.</p>

            <p>Seriously, poisons might work. Nothing is immune to everything, and DoSAT could easily hook up some kind of delivery system. Start with ricin or botulinum.

            <p>It&#39;s not that kaiju are poison-immune, it&#39;s the fact that there&#39;s simply <i>too much monster</i> for any given poison to get through. No matter how much you put into it, a kaiju&#39;s sheer size means that any poison you apply will be diluted to the point of doing nothing.<br><br>Fifteen kilograms of botulinum might put down a blue whale, but kaiju are many hundreds of times larger.

            <p>Botulism toxin has an estimated LD-50 of one <i>nanogram</i> per kilogram. Knifehead weighed 2,500 tons, which means you&#39;d need 2.5 milligrams of botulism toxin to hit LD-50 (assuming metric tons. We benighted imperial-measurement people would need slightly less).<br><br>Of course, botulism is a hugely specific toxin - it&#39;s nothing short of a protein, with an immense atomic mass and a very specific neurotoxic pathway. So let&#39;s pick something simpler...<br><br>And by &quot;something simpler&quot;, I mean &quot;agent orange&quot;! Dioxins are very simple chemicals - they&#39;re relatively stable bearers of chlorine. Chlorine is oxygen&#39;s bigger, badder brother - it&#39;s hellishly reactive, and conveniently enough, will happily kill anything that was designed to live in an oxygen-rich environment.<br><br>At a mere 20 µg/kg for ld50, we&#39;d need to dose Knifehead with half a kilogram of agent orange to hit LD-50. That&#39;s a relatively achievable amount - although the EPA would probably not be hugely happy with you for it.<br><br>In short: If you can find a reasonably effective neurotoxin, kauju are totally poisonable. You have to make major-environmental-disaster quantities of toxin, sure, but that&#39;s really only a couple pounds of the stuff, tops.</p>

            <p>I was thinking of disposal of Suvian kaiju in general, but that could work for M.U.T.O.!Sonic specifically. As for how to get him there, well, the fic I&#39;m sporking has quite a few mini-kaiju - I imagine that in the Godzilla universe, misspelled kaiju names create mini-versions of said kaiju, and any non-kaiju names that get bungled create mini-Godzillas. They&#39;d be about the size of the Jurassic Park T. rex, since that&#39;s small, right?

Besides, I want one of the agents to keep a mini-Godzilla and the Shrink Ray would be perfect for keeping him at a reasonable size.</p>

            <p>There was another film in the Honey I Shrunk Series, called Honey, I Blew Up the Baby.  Which contrary to what the title may imply is not about a dead baby.  What happens is that the Shrink Ray had been redesigned to increase size rather than shrink.  So it ended up having a Giant Baby terrorizing the people.  So it should work.</p>

            <p>I know they are stabilized plotholes, and there is something about coordinates, but what on earth are the coordinates? How specific can you get? How can Agents know all of these arbitrary coordinates?<br><br>I always thought of the RA as having some pre-set coordinate options, such as Partner, Mary Sue, and major locations in canons. Otherwise, it works similarly to the Portal gun. Point at thing, pull trigger, travel. How would one program &quot;inside Soniju&#39;s aorta, connected to the moon?&quot; If you were to try that, you would have to have a very long section of one of the agents trying to figure out how to program that setting in, while the other protects them from the monster.<br><br>Also, knowing Kaiju and Sonic Sues, that may well not do much.

            <p>First, small side tangent. Why does Sonic have the worst fanfics? I suppose it has to do partially with the flimsy canon it&#39;s based off of, but I have never seen any evidence of a good Sonic fic.<br><br>Anyway, kaiju. To be honest, I would be tempted to bring in the giant battle robots from Pacific Rim. It would allow for Agents to get closer through the Mind Melds, and provide a lot of humor though them trying to get the darn thing to work, and just not working. Although, I have no idea how you could slip it in to the fic reasonably. A really strong Not My Problem field? Although, that sounds like a bit of a cop-out. The best rule of thumb for PPC tech: very powerful, but can break at any minute. Nothing can make the job too easy. That&#39;s why we have disguises, no? However, in the case of a giant robot that rivals the Transformers in size... I don&#39;t know. Up to you.</p>

            <p>The problem is that in the actual Pacific Rim movie, the Jaegers aren&#39;t actually as durable against the kaiju as most people think. Leatherback and Otachi were able to dismember two of them in quick succession before Gipsy Danger was brought in, and these were some of the only remaining ones after the Jaeger program got shut down - they were just THAT powerful. I should also point out that the Pacific Rim kaiju are apparently much lighter than most monsters of that size range tend to be, and realistically they&#39;d be knocked over by a strong wind like the kinds encountered at the tops of skyscrapers. If they&#39;re that lightweight (and I can only assume that MUTO!Sonic would probably be of a similar constitution) and they&#39;re able to destroy two Jaegers operated by experienced teams of highly trained soldiers... I can only imagine what something like that could do to a Jaeger at a constant risk of breaking down, operated by a pair of teenagers with no experience with such technology whatsoever (or, Arceus forbid, a tween who suffers from crippling anxiety).<br><br>As for the other suggestions, shooting the MUTO!Sonic out into orbit will likely make a bad situation worse - what if it meets Ghidorah and uses the Suefluence on him? And I know enough about speculative kaiju biology to say with confidence that bleeding it out would take way too long.<br><br>I guess a Jaeger is the only thing that comes close to a good suggestion, but even that&#39;s not saying much given what happened to most of them in the Pacific Rim canon. I honestly have no clue as to what else to do that would stay true to the Duty, though. *shrug*</p>

            <p>Starting a new topic here to avoid taking attention away from the recently posted and nicely done Rose Potter sporkings...<br><br>So. Harry Potter, genderbent. Can it be done right? If so, how would you do it? How would Harriet Potter be different from Harry?<br><br>My thoughts on the matter:<br>-The Dursleys treat her differently from Harry. Petunia sees entirely too much of Lily in her, and is even more severe and overbearing than she was to Harry. However, Dudley mostly ignores rather than bullies her because she is &quot;just a girl&quot;.<br><br>-She moves from the still largely gender-biased Muggle world into the wizarding world, where gender matters much less.<br><br>-Being female, she tends toward &quot;protect my friends&quot; rather than &quot;defeat my enemies&quot;, which changes her battle strategies somewhat (it&#39;s something about the different hormone levels and the need to protect infants--it&#39;s a slight effect, but it&#39;s there, thought it wouldn&#39;t make much of a difference early on, before puberty).<br><br>-She doesn&#39;t trigger Snape&#39;s ire so much because she reminds him of Lily. He&#39;s awkward around her and tends to pretend to ignore her rather than actively attacking the way he would Harry.<br><br>-As a female, she has slightly better verbal skills and slightly poorer visual-spatial skills. If you were to exaggerate the difference, she would be better at communicating, more likely to be good at things like Charms, and not so good at Quidditch or dueling.<br><br>-Her slightly better social skills (starting out) would give her a larger circle of friends and make her more popular. She would also be more likely to seek out other people when in trouble rather than try to handle things herself. She would be more prone to &quot;relational aggression&quot; (fighting with words and social ostracism) rather than physical or in this case magical fights.<br><br>-Being better at language gives her enough of an edge to discover her gift for Parseltongue earlier in life, age ten or younger. Maybe she even has a pet snake, or snake friends, as a child. It wouldn&#39;t endear her to Petunia, that&#39;s for sure, but it could change everything when it came to dealing with the Basilisk. (No, I don&#39;t think she&#39;d befriend the basilisk; it&#39;s firmly under Tom Riddle&#39;s control. She might understand what she&#39;s hearing earlier than Harry did, though.)<br><br>But these are all slight differences. Maybe Harriet makes the Quidditch team in her second year instead of her first year, isn&#39;t so quick with defense against the dark arts, confides in Dumbledore more easily, or turns her larger group of friends against Draco Malfoy rather than just cursing him. They&#39;re still very slight differences. The only big differences I can see would be in how Harriet is treated in the Muggle world, where her being female really matters--both because the world sees her as just-a-girl and because Petunia sees her as Lily&#39;s daughter.<br><br>How would you avoid the problem of just following canon much of the time? Harriet Potter isn&#39;t so different from Harry Potter, especially since, in the wizarding world, they are more or less socially equivalent.</p>

            <p>Personally, if I were writing a girl!Harry fic, I would significantly alter her relationship with the Dursleys, and through that her views on the magical world.  Let&#39;s call this theoretical character Daisy, in order to distinguish her from other female versions of Harry.<br><br>Petunia does see more of Lily in Daisy than she does in Harry; however, instead of outright rejecting her, she sees Daisy as a version of Lily that can still be saved.  So on one hand, she would be more &quot;loving&quot; towards Daisy, but on the other, Daisy would still be harshly punished for any accidental magic.  For Daisy, the punishments would be more traumatic; unlike Harry, she wants to please the Dursleys, and it&#39;s the rejection that really hurts.  Instead of being thrilled by the magical world, she hates it - she wishes she was normal, so her family would love her.  At the same time, she&#39;s desperate to please those around her, and the magical world is all she&#39;s got.<br><br>Overall, she&#39;d be less of a rebel than Harry.  I doubt she&#39;d make Gryffindor, though if you wanted to keep the same cast you could make an argument for it.  Nor, however, would she be in Slytherin, like in other AU fics; Slytherin is overly proud of its magical lineage, and Daisy would loathe that aspect of them.  Instead, I think she&#39;d fit better in Hufflepuff.  At first, she just wants to be accepted by anyone and will do anything to fit in, but eventually she learns the meaning of <i>true</i> acceptance and loyalty.<br><br>The main issue with such a character, story-wise, is that I think Daisy would basically start out as a less intelligent version of Hermione, almost painfully afraid of breaking the rules.  And unlike Hermione, who gets kind of dragged into things by Harry and Ron at first, she&#39;d have no motivation to get involved in the plot.  Plus, I think GoF and OotP would leave her traumatized and depressed - not exactly a character arc I&#39;d enjoy writing.<br><br>Note that, I don&#39;t think this is necessarily specific to a female Harry; a similar AU could be done with a male version.  In fact, this goes so significantly beyond making him a girl that gender would be incidental to the plotline.  However, as far as using a genderbend to take dramatic liberties with characterization goes, I think this is more reasonable than a naked ninja-druid sociopath.</p>

            <p>I think it can be done well, but it seems like the differences here are a bit stereotypical? There doesn&#39;t seem to be a reason why a Harriet would necessarily be friendlier or be worse at Quidditch. Though since you are exaggerating I guess it makes sense?<br><br>I think she&#39;d probably have a different experience of being bullied, though. <br><br>Also, on the Snape thing: I once saw someone say on Tumblr: &quot;If Harry had been a girl Snape would have treated her the way Petyr Baelish treats Sansa Stark.&quot;</p>

            <p>We did study the differences between men and women in psychology classes, and they&#39;re not that extreme. Even the most pronounced ones are a matter of a couple of percentage points. Men are physically stronger and women live longer... but even then you have female bodybuilders and hundred-year-old men.<br><br>It&#39;s too slight a difference to make any predictions from. Take any particular man or woman--their gender tells you so little about them that you honestly can&#39;t make a guess with any kind of accuracy. So, give Harry Potter two X chromosomes, and you don&#39;t get that much of a difference.<br><br>The only real, major differences would be not in Harriet Potter herself, but in the way others treated her and the &quot;This is what it means to be female&quot; that she would pick up from the Muggle world. And if you emphasized those enough, you could get a different character for Harriet from what you got for Harry... but I&#39;d be worried about making her a female stereotype just to get her to be different enough from Harry to be worth writing a story about.</p>

            <p>That could just end up ridiculously messed up very quickly.  But that is very likely correct.  Snape essentially treats Harry the way he does, because of his physical similarity to James.  So...That might make Snape even worse.  He would at least seem less like evil incarnate, but still...that would not take much to get very disturbing.</p>

            <p>Good AUs exist, right? So--we have an AU in which the prophecy&#39;s pronouns are reversed and Voldemort hears that a girl will kill him. He goes after a female whose parents defied him (could be anyone--someone mentioned Susan Bones and she&#39;s a good candidate). <br><br>That would also make for a very different story. Say you do pick Susan as your Girl Who Lived; she&#39;s in Hufflepuff, for one thing; that would give us a different cast of characters. She has living family she cares about, and who are later killed, which could make for a major crisis point for her just like Sirius&#39;s death does for Harry.<br><br>Another possibility for an AU with a female as Voldemort&#39;s nemesis is this: For some reason, Harry Potter wasn&#39;t the only one-year-old in that room that day. Maybe he had a twin sister, or maybe a friend&#39;s child was visiting. When Voldemort went after Harry, he tried to kill everyone in the house, and Lily shielded Harry from the killing curse and from the soul fragment, which then attached itself to the only unshielded child in the room. Then you&#39;d end up with Harry shielded from Voldemort by Lily&#39;s love, but the other child serving as an unwilling Horcrux--she&#39;d really get the bad end of the deal.<br><br>The AU with the prophecy pointing to a female AND Lily and James having a daughter is a bit more dodgy, because it involves two changes; but you could swing it if you were careful because the prophecy would just have been Trelawney&#39;s seeing what would happen in her own AUverse in which Harry was born female. It would unseat Neville from his position as Harry&#39;s &quot;backup&quot;, because Voldemort would be looking for girls. It would also be closest to the standard Harry Potter story, and you&#39;d run into the same plagiarism problem that Rose Potter runs into.</p>

Not to mention if the prophecy could have referred to a girl in canon, surely there might have been a girl out there born on July 31 whose parents defied Voldemort thrice? The odds aren&#39;t great, sure, but there&#39;s still a chance.</p>

            <p>I also cannot remember where Snape got cut off.  And I am not certain about it. If I remember correctly the only original Order members who had girls was the Bones family, the Weasleys are the only other ones to come to mind and they did not join up until the reformed order.  So the only one that I think would qualify would have been Susan Bones, though I do not know when she was born.</p>

            <p>The hard part would be making Harriet Potter different enough to not just be a rewrite, but also similar enough that you don&#39;t warp canon. If this can be accomplished, than I&#39;d go for it. If it can&#39;t be accomplished, than I&#39;d still go for it, just maybe write a few short chapters, as anything else is not really worth your time. I like point number six that you came up with, as that could make for some interesting bits.</p>

            <p>I did say that &#39;this entire story&#39; doesn&#39;t really count. ;) Trivialised mass murder is simple (if not easy) to do right - you have your (hopefully non-sympathetic!) <i>characters</i> trivialise it.

            <p>&#39;Goes over to kinetic weaponry&#39; is one I&#39;ll have to pass on - I&#39;ve no idea why that&#39;s even a problem. &#39;TSAB&#39;s evil&#39;... what, you can&#39;t see a presumably-good presumably-organisation turning evil with the best intentions?

The general concept of &#39;personify something to awaken public opinion&#39;, however, is a fairly time-honoured notion. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Kitchener_Wants_You">Lord Kitchener Wants YOU To Believe It</a>. For that matter, <i>political cartoons</i> have been doing it since at least the 1850s. Yeah, most of those examples have been personifications of countries - but in the modern era, using the same techniques to evoke feelings and provoke actions about ebola (or anything else) sounds like a valid strategy to me.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Should it be done, now, that&#39;s the question. When doing gender bent stories, you often run into one major problem: blatant plagiarism. Oh, yes, there would be some differences, but on the whole, there is not enough difference between Harry and Harriet to warrant a full fic, ala Rose Potter. Now, a one-shot AU? Possibly. Multiverse hijinks? Entirely probable. Tumblr ask blog? YOU BET! Rake in those reblogs. But full, multi-chapter fic by itself? I just don&#39;t see it working.<br><br>That all said, I do like the analysis you made on the difference between Harry and Harriet.

            <p>Apparently they do have plenty of clothes and items, you just have to earn them. So it&#39;s less like TekTek which was basically a doll maker using all of Gaia&#39;s items and body types, and more like Gaia itself.</p>

            <p>It is a little wonky to access, but if you make an avatar, try to change it. When the menu to do so pops up, scroll all the way down. You should see something that looks like an ad, but it should say &quot;what if I had all the items&quot;. If you click on it, you&#39;ll be taken to a different menu for customizing. And in this menu, you can make an avatar with all available parts, and it&#39;ll let you save it as an image.</p>

            <p>Honestly, I&#39;m still surprised that anyone had the guts to take on Rose Potter in the first place, so the fact that it&#39;s all done just feels weird. Absolutely beautiful job, on the whole string of things. Normally, I&#39;d say I can&#39;t wait to see what you put out next, but I think you&#39;ve earned a nice, long break.</p>

            <p>However, I do see now how the transformation into a Time Lady could be a source of character development rather than a power-up...<br><br>There&#39;s the body-horror angle. Her mind doesn&#39;t expect her body to be different, especially her sensory system. <br><br>She&#39;ll have to leave her past behind. No one who knew her before, and doesn&#39;t now know about the PPC, would believe that this completely different-looking girl is Rina. That includes family, friends... <br><br>The possibility of a TARDIS is interesting, but I&#39;m wondering: Does she have to get one? Would she be able to learn how to use it? A Time Lady without a TARDIS might be more interesting to write simply because it hasn&#39;t been done very often.<br><br>The reality of presumably having regenerations left could change things too. It might mean that in a dangerous situation where somebody&#39;s going to die, Rina&#39;d have to step up. Ouch. <br><br>Of course regenerations aren&#39;t infallible. Destroy the brain, or kill someone very suddenly, and they&#39;re probably not coming back. Even worse is the prospect of dying somewhere in a dangerous environment where you wouldn&#39;t be found for, say... an hour or so. Oh, you&#39;d die all right--repeatedly. If you couldn&#39;t keep your head enough to decide not to regenerate in those circumstances (and does Rina know enough about her new biology to know how she&#39;d even begin doing that?), you&#39;d be in for an exceedingly nasty end. Even if you were rescued halfway through, you&#39;d probably be in serious trouble, with your biology badly messed up.<br><br>And then there&#39;s the problem of having to deal with other Time Lords... though you seem to have already covered that. :)</p>

            <p>At least, not unless she somehow acquires one from DoSAT, but that would be silly. <br><br>But yeah, basically, the only family she has who knows are her parents and brother. Everyone else? Nope. <br><br>She&#39;ll be spending a lot of time looking through books on Time Lord physiology. It&#39;ll still take a looong time before she adjusts, though. You don&#39;t forget eighteen-ish years of being human that fast. And even then, there&#39;ll probably be stuff that surprises her. Not to mention, she doesn&#39;t have the knowledge to employ her new senses to their fullest. You can&#39;t identify different materials by their taste if you&#39;ve never tasted them before, for example.</p>

            <p>I do think you owe us at least one hilarious scene of a confused Rina trying to control a completely unfamiliar TARDIS, though. :)<br><br>Good luck with writing a high-powered Rina; we all know the more powerful the character, the harder they are to handle.

            <p>“I’ll be damned,” muttered Owen under his breath. “Rookie Zeb actually survived a Legendary badfic. I knew he had it in him when I met him at Rudi’s-- kid’s got an Aura like a Pyroar.” He paused at the end of the hallway. <i>Let’s see... there’s a staircase in front of us... two RCs with odd numbers facing each other on the left... Right. We need to turn right here.</i> He turned the corner and looked at his partner who was sluggishly plodding alongside him. “How about you, Buck? What d’you think about Zebby-Zeb?”<br><br>“I don’t know, really. I can’t remember him that well,” replied Buck, “but maybe I was just... falling... asleep...” The Skiddo yawned out the last few words as his eyes closed in preparation for a catnap. The Pokémon ground to a halt in the middle of the Generic Grey hallway, snoring gently.<br><br>“Hey now. No falling asleep when there’s a letter to be delivered,” said Owen, poking Buck’s nose with a folded-up sheet of paper. When the Skiddo started moving forward again the Lucario cleared his throat. “Okay. Final check. How does this sound like to you...” Owen squinted at his letter. “Dear Rookie,” he read.<br><br>“Sounds condescending.”<br><br>“Well, he <i>is</i> a newbie, right? ‘Congratulations on marathoning that mess of a mission. You’ve got Guts-- note the capital G-- and I like that in a ‘mon. I can tell you’re going to go far.&#39;”<br><br>“I’m pretty sure he has Intimidate.”<br><br>“Quiet, you.”<br><br>“Well, you asked me for opinions...”<br><br>“Whatever. ‘I’m not sure if you remember this but I offered you a free training session with me when we met at Rudi’s. I’d like to extend that offer again and see what you’re made of. Signed, Owen, DIA.’ Eh? Is it good?”<br><br>“Did we really meet him? Was that even canon?”<br><br>“What are you even <i>talking</i> about? Of course it’s ‘canon’! You remember, don’t you? Zeb went for a walk with Maxwell and then we followed him and then Victoria hauled us back to Ben and then we had to respond to that Judoon thing...”<br><br>“Iunno, I was feeling sleepy back then...”<br><br>The Lucario executed the Double Facepaw Manoeuvre and muttered something to the effect of “Never mind.” He briskly marched towards RC 3-Apple-14’s door, crouched, and slid the letter under the door. Owen made his way back to Buck and gave the snoozing Mount Pokémon a quick tap on the horns. “All right, we’re done here. Let’s move.”</p>

Hopefully that&#39;s enough to fill up the preview space.

BUT! I am very pleased to say my concerns were unfounded. Iximaz, please accept my heartfelt congratulations for taking an old idea and making it better, faster, stronger than it was before. You really did your homework, and I found myself laughing several times after I&#39;d finished reading and gone about my business as I realized exactly how long you&#39;ve been planning this. I am very, very impressed.<br><br>My only real issue was the lack of closure for the Potterverse, but since Skarmory&#39;s setting up an interlude for just that purpose, I think it&#39;ll be okay. And heck, it makes sense. Your agents took a good and proper beating. They can&#39;t really be expected to handle it themselves. They&#39;ve done enough, poor things!<br><br>I might suggest building up Rose Potter&#39;s growing awareness of the agents a bit more in the last few parts, though. She&#39;s pretty angry and confrontational with them when she spots them, but apart from one scene that I can recall (when she&#39;s telling the story of the graveyard to the Gryffindors), she hasn&#39;t really shown much awareness that anything is out of place in her world up until then, so it comes out of the blue a little.<br><br>Other than that, you&#39;ve shown a great ability for planning things out and properly foreshadowing them, so again, my most hearty congratulations on a job well done! ^</em>^<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>The non-spoiler part first: hooray, she&#39;s dead! I just read 4-6 in four hours (between other things, don&#39;t worry), and the way Rose just kept building and building... yeah, that was quite a ride. Eesh.<br><br>Also: and here was me thinking one mission a week on <i>Driftwood</i> was high-speed writing...<br><br>And the spoilers. I&#39;m gonna hand over to Morgan for this one.<br><br><hr>
<br><br>Morgan drummed her fingers on her TARDIS&#39; console, looking between the two messages.

Though she didn&#39;t do much with that Ceka woman...&quot;<br><br>She trailed off, then glanced around the TARDIS. &quot;Right. No-one here. I need to get myself a companion.&quot; She eyed the Librarian&#39;s message, then pulled up the ICEP address book. &quot;Dives, Rina... partnered with Zeb. So at least she&#39;s got that covered.&quot;<br><br>Morgan drummed her fingers again, then abruptly closed all three windows and pulled the lever to open the doors. &quot;The D.O.R.K.S.,&quot; she muttered as she headed out, &quot;always the D.O.R.K.S. We should&#39;ve had that thing banned ages back...&quot;<br><br><hr>
<br><br>Morgan is available for conversations, and promises not to bite. Unless the Guardsman is mentioned.<br><br>And now I have to run. ^_^<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Well, I approve of the change. It&#39;s grounded in canon, as others mentioned, and as long as there are consequences - I think the interlude&#39;s an example - I think the change is fine. Is it special? Definitely. Is it Speshul? I don&#39;t think so.</p>

            <p>Typing a few lines here so nobody stumbles across something ahead of time. Read the mission, it&#39;s good. Really! <br><br>Adding another line.<br><br>And another.<br><br>SPOILERS INCOMING! TURN BACK OR FOREVER BE SPOILED!<br><br>-<br>-<br>-<br>-<br>-<br><br>That was my initial response to this whole thing as well. To be honest... I was very against it. The original plan was to have the agents be tortured and forced into FicPsych for a while, but Iximaz said she didn&#39;t feel like she could write that comfortably. When she told me she was going to kill off Rina and do this... I basically tried everything in the book to try and change her mind. <br><br>However... I have changed my mind on it. I still don&#39;t really like it, but I trust Iximaz as an author and I know that she will make it the best story it can possibly be. I&#39;ve seen some of the things she has planned for Rina in the future, and it&#39;s good. To be perfectly clear, this transformation is NOT a good thing as a whole. There are so many problems that come with it. This is the price she has to pay for saving her life. Loss of self, and loss of normalcy. Basically... just wait. I promise that you won&#39;t be disappointed.<br><br>(Oh, and the Disguise Generator and DORKS change agent biology according to canon. If you&#39;re dying and disguised as a Time Lord, you&#39;re going to regenerate. No going back. You can become human again with the Disguise Generator, but it&#39;s temporary. Time Lord becomes your new default.) <br></p>

            <p>I... Really don&#39;t want to get into it if I can avoid it. Let&#39;s just say, SVU had an episode recently about a serial killer/rapist using online games to find victims. The entire episode was very poorly written, to say the least. One of the funner lines was, &quot;I read on Kotaku that [World of Warcraft clone] is better then Civilization 5 with the Brave New World expansion!&quot;</p>

            <p>I just finished copying all of the mission parts into one document. This mission is, when all compiled together: 201 pages, and 78,291 words long.<br><br>Iximaz, I want you to take a good, long look at those numbers. This mission is longer than <i>The Philosopher&#39;s Stone.</i> Iximaz, I want you to look at those numbers, and realize what you have done. You have, essentially, wrote a novel. In a little over a month. This is a major accomplishment.<br><br>As I said before, I will be reading all of it tonight, and commenting on it tomorrow. I will be sure to be on the final doc tomorrow to congratulate and discuss how it all went. However, no matter what I think, no matter how well received this mission is, I want you to know how proud of you I am. I envy your speed and skill as a writer, and I look forward to whatever else you write.<br><br>Congratulations, Iximaz, on your first novel.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m curious, though - won&#39;t it be a little... out of its time? <i>The X-Files</i> was very much a product of the era when &#39;UFO&#39; and &#39;alien&#39; were supernatural, or at best pseudoscientific, terms - we watched the entire first series in a week a few months ago, and I started twitching every time Mulder did one of his &#39;your human science can&#39;t hope to understand&#39;... y&#39;know, space flight, or genetics, or whatever <i>easy-to-understand scientific concept</i> he was going on about at the time... speeches.<br><br>But I... think we&#39;re out of that period now?

Which... is pretty backwards. That&#39;s not how you create a character people will be interested in - particularly in the PPC, where they&#39;ll spend most of every mission in a disguise anyway. Species - and abilities in general - do not make for interesting characters; personality does that.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>... you&#39;ve said things like this:<br><br><i>I actually have 48 options to choose from, if I&#39;m going with Robot Masters that weren&#39;t translated to Battle Network.</i><br><br>Which, unless I&#39;m dramatically misreading, means &#39;I want this species of agent, but haven&#39;t decided which of <b>48</b> presumably highly diverse canon characters I want to crib from&#39;.

            <p>Valon as the id, Kala as the ego (though their roles seem to be reversing), and the new agent as the superego.<br><br>It goes a bit beyond that, though. I basically wanted three interdependent agents with different specialties, where losing one hampers the others&#39; ability to finish the mission. <br><br>Valon is the canon expert. Lose him, and it&#39;s more difficult to spot canon breaks.<br><br>Kala is the fighter.

Without them, Valon and Kala are stuck for any knowledge that&#39;s not related to canon or fighting.<br><br>Of course, considering what&#39;s happening, I&#39;m no longer 100% sure that this is a good idea.</p>

            <p>I actually do have an explanation for this character: Technically, he doesn&#39;t exist in the MMBN canon, so he&#39;s essentially an OC. He COULD exist, though, thus appearing here.

            <p>You don&#39;t want to think up your own character, so you are borrowing SIGMA?<br><br>He is a terrorist, a murderer, and a tyrant.  In the Megaman X series, he becomes an unkillable virus who not only infects every Reploid he can, but also got his programming added into all the new Reploids they were making, so he can come back a near infinite number of times.  How is it a good idea to let him loose in the PPC, where he can get access to any technologically advanced world he pleases?<br><br>Seriously, think about that.  If you are writing him even remotely close to in-character, you are unleashing a computerized terrorist on every world that has the internet.  This is a VERY BAD IDEA.<br><br><br>On another point, I don&#39;t like the attitude you&#39;ve taken in regards to this whole thing.  You&#39;ve basically told me, and everyone else who might ever work with you that you are lazy (<i>I kinda don&#39;t want to try and make a new character from scratch.</i>) and won&#39;t listen to what they suggest (<i>You can check what I&#39;ve written if you wish, but just know that I am very, very stubborn and unlikely to change my mind without a really compelling argument.</i>).

You might want to read <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Rose_Potter">the actual Rose Potter mission</a> first, though, so you can understand what&#39;s going on.<br><br>Please send me an e-mail at skarmorysilver at gmail dot com (subbing punctuation as needed) if you&#39;re interested in undoing all of the carnage that Rose inflicted upon the good people of Hogwarts, and I&#39;ll gladly send you the GDocs file! :)</p>

            <p>The Department of Fictional Psychology staff have a little whip-around to assemble the following gift basket:<br><br>- A selection of the finest teas, because tea is a cure-all, it&#39;s canon.<br>- A bottle of reannual wine. (Make sure to drink after you experience the hangover to avoid a paradox.)<br>- A large mason jar of Generic Fantasy Ale.<br>- A PADD full of soothing music from across the Federation.<br>- An assortment of the finest French chocolates.<br>- An industrial-sized jar of Bleeprin. (For Zeb.)<br>- One bottle each of Pink Stuff and Purple Stuff. (For Rina; use wisely, you don&#39;t want to know how they got the Purple Stuff.)<br>- Several pieces of fruit.

            <p>Zeb woke, sniffing curiously. &quot;Do I smell Bleep-stuffs?&quot; he asked hopefully, raising  his head to look at Rina, who was in the bathroom and apparently making faces at her new reflection.<br><br>&quot;Yeah, the entirety of FicPsych sent a gift basket, can you believe it?&quot; she replied, quickly pulling her tongue back behind her teeth and pointing at the coffee table. <br><br>Zeb looked and would have raised his eyebrows if he&#39;d been a human. &quot;Wow, that&#39;s... that was very nice of them,&quot; he said softly.<br><br>&quot;Isn&#39;t it, though?&quot; Rina said, smiling. &quot;I wonder if Nurse Jenni had anything to do with this. Nice lady. Wish they hadn&#39;t gone overboard with the alcohol, though. I don&#39;t like the stuff and apparently can&#39;t get drunk anyway now unless I try really, really hard.&quot;<br><br>Zeb gave a half-shrug. &quot;Well, there&#39;s certainly quite a lot of it, from what I can smell,&quot; he said, spearing something that looked like a Pecha Berry with a foreclaw and sniffing it. It smelled very similar to Pecha Berries, so he popped it in his mouth. &quot;Oh, that is good.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Try the oranges, they&#39;re also fantastic,&quot; Rina advised. &quot;And remind me to send a thank-you note later. This is just... wow, you know?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Bit overwhelming, yeah,&quot; Zeb agreed, gnawing on the pit in the center of the Pecha lookalike. &quot;Mm, this is really good.&quot;<br><br>Rina laughed and came over to sit next to him, grabbing the giant jar of ale from the basket and opening it. &quot;Let&#39;s see how much of a lightweight new me is, shall we?&quot;</p>

            <p>The Pink Stuff is mostly Potterverse Euphoria Elixir with a little bit of Romulan Ale mixed in. This is apparently enough to make it extremely potent to humans, so it ought to work even on Gallifreyan physiology, IMO. And, as long as she makes sure to take some Purple Stuff afterwards, she won&#39;t even have to suffer the awful hangover.

            <p>40K is THE crappiest place to live. The good guys are either The Imperium of Man, who are basically catholic space-Nazis. The other good guys are The Tau Empire, and they are basically communist space-Nazis. You should look up the Imperial guard, the Space Marines and the Orks, as well. The bad guys are mass murdering evil cultists, and the comic relief are the Orks, who are like Football Hooligans in space. They also kill lots of people. Eternal war, evil gods, evil Eldar.

            <p>...it depends on what you&#39;ll think of first when you see a certain phrase. And alos because if the thousands of fanbases. Caution is key.

            <p>It&#39;s just that I&#39;ve only ever heard 40K being used to describe Warhammer 40000. I&#39;m just trying to clarify things for future reference. So far, it looks like I don&#39;t want to open with fanspeak, and instead use common terminology, at least to start with. I originally assumed 40K would have a huge fan presence here, if only because it&#39;s a gargantuan fandom. So, again, I meant no offense, just trying to clarify things so I don&#39;t screw up so bad in the future. I&#39;m really tempting fate by saying that, aren&#39;t I?</p>

            <p>Mostly she was fuming in outraged amazement that someone knew and had seen and knew and knew and <i>knew</i>-<br><br>She shot to her feet with a noise like a collapsible tent unfolding and turned the kind of glare on the Guardsman that could set fire to the victim&#39;s grandchildren. &quot;You will not talk about her.

You have never known anyone addressed as such. The name is an entirely closed book to you, as, I suspect, are books of any sort whatsoever. You are not aware that I possessed a companion of any kind during any of my regenerations. You derive the most intense sexual gratification possible to comprehend from the thought of being punched repeatedly in the genitals by a hairy bodybuilder covered in fishpaste, and that one&#39;s for touching my photograph.&quot;<br><br>She shoved the neuralyser back up her sleeve and turned to face the others, her expression icy, her eyes dead and listless. &quot;Potterverse wand holsters are such useful things; I don&#39;t know why they aren&#39;t standard issue,&quot; she said blandly. &quot;I shall compose a note to Stores after fetching my drink. Does anyone else want to get their grubby little fingerprints all over my belongings or bring up poorly-shaved apes of debatable sentience? No? <i>I didn&#39;t think so</i>.&quot;<br><br>She was completely unaware that the Guardsman, or possibly the Guardian, she wasn&#39;t sure, had been completely unaffected by her neuralyser, since she had flashed it in the face of a rather confused-looking Tribble that was now rapidly re-evaluating its life choices and wondering where it could get its claws on some fishpaste. Head injuries, man. They sneak up on you.</p>

            <p>They have a tendency to go off at suboptimal intervals.<br><br>The Notary was a planner, a common enough trait in any bureaucrat worth their rubber stamp. That included a mental inventory of DIA standard equipment and any notable exceptions and esoteric bits of kit - like, for instance, a laser screwdriver. By running a diagnostic cycle and interrupting it just so, it set up a feedback loop that ended in a rather explosive flash-and-smoke.<br><br>This had originally been planned for use as a getaway aid, with a brief tidy-up later, but now?

            <p>Valon had been too dumbstruck by the sheer nerve of the Notary to properly respond when Kala charged her. After the dust had settled, he turned to Rina. &quot;Did not think someone could be that horrible. Wow.<br><br>&quot;But I feel like she should have realized that provoking Kala&#39;s not just a jerk move; it&#39;s <i>dangerous</i>. She&#39;s big, strong, and not really in control of her emotions.The only way I&#39;ve found to calm her is to give her Sumisu, and that&#39;s a risky proposition, getting close to an angry scorpion and all.&quot;<br><br>((Totally not looking for an excuse to reinvolve Rina, nope.

            <p>&quot;I merely sent a request that your department run an external diagnostic scan at the exact time of the automatic upload. You, however, have just deliberately and conspicuously messed with your bodycam while in the field and actively engaged in the pursuit of a suspect, no matter how dubious your allegations may be. That&#39;s a clear violation of DIA Code of Practice article #15, clause b, subsection xv. This is all going in the report. Nearly finished now, actually... and done.&quot; She allowed herself a small smile of satisfaction as she sent the form off, referenced thoroughly and in triplicate.  &quot;We&#39;re almost out of the Howling now. You&#39;ll probably want to put your other cameras back-&quot;<br><br>SPLOOSH.<br><br>&quot;Since we&#39;ll be walking through a Thief&#39;s Downfall.&quot; The Notary fished out a handkerchief and wiped the water off. &quot;Terribly sorry, it&#39;s the smoke. Counts as a disguise ever since that incursion a few months ago in DODAEG with the Frozen Sue, and it sets off the defence grid in enough quantities. I&#39;m also privy to information regarding smartdust and similar platforms - everyone has their hobbies, after all - and I&#39;m sure you&#39;re aware how badly delicate technology reacts to the presence of Potterverse-style magic in such quantities.&quot;<br><br>She turned to face him and smiled again, or at least showed her teeth. &quot;So gentlemanly to walk a woman back to her RC after an accident. That will definitely be reflected in your report... or it would, had I not already sent it off. I can ask to resubmit, but once the gears begin to turn, well, I&#39;m sure you know how that goes. Do drop round for tea and war stories sometime. I&#39;m free on Saint Never&#39;s Day.&quot; With that, she gently shut the door of her RC and bolted it, deadlock-sealing it with the interlocking wooden setup that was the only kind her partner could use. Acute arcane technometaplasia. Such a horrid condition.</p>

He carefully stowed the medkit back where it belonged, pulled off his used gloves, and rearranged his body camera. The former soldier then stopped and leaned against the wall. He looked around him to make sure he was alone and pulled a out his laser screwdriver. He removed his tricorn and looked at the net of electrodes that lined the inside of the hat. Even if his passage through the Thief&#39;s Downfall had shorted out the hidden camera and the electronics embedded in his hat, everything up until his unexpected shower would&#39;ve been recorded directly to his brain. Good old Gallifreyan headcam technology: the ultimate redundancy. Never leave home without it. The Guardsman pulled another set of electrodes from a pocket, attached them to his head, and wrapped the wires around the tip of his screwdriver. A few seconds later the video of his entire encounter with the Notary had been sent to DIA Central along with an email saying that he&#39;d drop by Internal Review to clear up any misconceptions.<br><br>Satisfied with his work, the Guardsman put away his electronics and continued his walk towards Rudi&#39;s, whistling a merry tune.</p>

            <p>How the human had managed to make a Balloon Eye of Harmony while staying balanced on a unicycle, all in the time it took for the pizza box to go up and come back down again, was entirely beyond her. She certainly wouldn&#39;t have liked to try it.<br><br><i>&#39;Congratulations&#39;, though,</i> she thought bitterly. <i>Oh, fantastic. Because I wanted the reminder so badly.</i><br><br>&quot;Thank you,&quot; she said aloud, trying to keep her eyes focused on the balloon. &quot;It was...definitely a shock. To hear about it. I...mm.&quot;<br><br>She couldn&#39;t look at the balloon any longer; part of Gallifrey or not, looking into the Eye of Harmony hadn&#39;t exactly been the most comforting experience of her life. It did rather pale next to the Time War, though.<br><br>&quot;Right,&quot; she added. &quot;Well. Thanks for your well wishes. And the balloon.&quot; She gave the string a half-hearted tug and tried to smile in a non-grimacing sort of way (this last, of course, failed).<br><br>--<br>((So, the Reader has her reasons, but the news about Gallifrey is actually rather complicated for her. And she&#39;s been arguing with her partner recently--very recently--about how she wants to go and try to assimilate into the canon, now that Gallifrey&#39;s around. I&#39;m not sure how well she&#39;s thought it through, considering that she hates Rassilon and he&#39;s presumably still alive, but...she misses her home, and wants to go back to the non-destroyed version, if only to see it for herself.))<br><br>((So. Obviously, Wobbles meant well, but...I basically read that and went, &#39;oh, the Reader will <i>not</i> take that well right now&#39; (and then I grinned). But that&#39;s a bit of why she&#39;s reacting this way--she spent some time thinking Gallifrey was gone, and then this happens, and it&#39;s just...complicated.))<br><br>((~DF))</p>

            <p>Wobbles wasn&#39;t one of the more observant people, at least unless she chose to be. At the moment, she had other things on her mind - the Notary&#39;s coming war with the Guardsman chief among them - so she did what she always did when she relaxed: made elaborate balloon art. This time, the challenge was doing it one handed, so she constructed an almost exact replica of Arcadia and tied it to the other balloon. &quot;For your friends!

            <p>...the Guardsman quietly reached into his coat&#39;s pocket and withdrew his laser screwdriver. He pointed it at the sleeve in which the Notary had stowed her neuralyzer and sent a locking command to the PPC gadget. As the Notary lectured to the onlookers, the <s>Guardian</s> Guardsman scanned her again to make sure she didn&#39;t have any other surprises literally and/or figuratively up her sleeve. Aside from an old staser model-- which he also locked with his screwdriver-- she didn&#39;t seem to be carrying any other weapons (barring her own person, of course). <br><br>&quot;Firstly, I&#39;m surprised that you thought it would actually work,&quot; said The Guardsman. &quot;<i>Surely</i> you must know that DIA equips their agents so that situations like these never happen. Just imagine how many people could get away with crimes just by flashing a neuralyzer in an officer&#39;s face...&quot; He rubbed his eyes, wishing that he had eyedrops to alleviate the discomfort caused by his anti-flash contact lenses.<br><br>&quot;Secondly... you&#39;re in big trouble now. Did you seriously try to mind-wipe and brainwash a DIA officer because I asked a question about a photo?&quot; the Guardsman sighed. &quot;Besides, I didn&#39;t even touch that thing because that&#39;s straight up <i>asking</i> for trouble. Did you ever ask yourself why you put people on edge?&quot; He gesticulated towards her deactivated neuralyzer tucked up her sleeve. &quot;Using force because things didn&#39;t go your way? Bullying people into submission? You just keep on running away from problems, don&#39;t you?&quot; <br><br>The Guardsman smiled. &quot;Oh yeah, one more thing. When the Time War started, you stole a TARDIS, didn&#39;t you? Yeah, lots of people stole TARDISes. Everyone was trying to run away from the War. You know what&#39;s funny though? Get this: when the frontier systems collapsed under the Dalek Armada we were supposed to evacuate the civilians and bring them to the Homeworld. Key word being &#39;supposed&#39;. You see, we had a TARDIS shortage! For every person stealing a TT capsule for themselves we could&#39;ve saved an entire town. A town! For one person!&quot; The Gallifreyan man stared at the Notary. &quot;I hope it was worth it.&quot;<br><br>- - -<br><br>((If there&#39;s one thing that Emiran hates more than Daleks it&#39;s probably deserters.))</p>

            <p>Well, she might have been looking at something she was scraping off her shoe. &quot;You will have a full report on my actions here, as well as your lack of respect for personal privacy or property, courtesy of the DIA Internal Review System as soon as I am able to deliver one. You have deliberately sought to reveal the details of an agent&#39;s private life in a public setting in order to embarrass them, during the process of which you insulted them repeatedly. You have deliberately damaged equipment issued by the Quartermasters&#39; Office over nothing more than a personal slight. This is what that report will say. I write them. Your superiors <i>read</i> them. I am not liked, but I serve a purpose. You? Your disciplinary record speaks for itself.&quot; With that, she showed him the smoking remains of her neuralyser. &quot;Exhibit A.&quot; A polythene bag with a photo frame in it, the picture turned away. &quot;Exhibit B. I can keep going, should you so desire. Or rather, you can keep digging, should you so desire. I&#39;d recommend against it.&quot; With that, the Notary swept from the room, hauling a dataslate from her pocket and scratching furiously at it on her way out.<br><br>---<br><br>Actually, she genuinely didn&#39;t steal her TARDIS. Technically. Spoilers: one of her regenerations was drafted and put in charge of a blockade runner, arguably doing more good than the Guardsman did. It was cornered and shot to hell, the crew dead, the Notary needed a body that could survive this kind of adventure (it being sort-of canon that Time Ladies have a bit more control over their regenerations) and wound up as the Fourth Notary, aka. the fun one. From there? Well, the vessel was listed as lost, so she took it as a sign, and for a while she lived.<br><br>And now she&#39;s a scumbag bureaucrat with no compunctions about bending the rules to get her way because she knows exactly which rules she&#39;s capable of bending and how to get out of it when she runs into a situation where she has to actually break one. Fun!</p>

            <p>Well, two things, really. Er, one and a half.<br><br>The Notary was checking through the Guardsman&#39;s registered equipment list to make sure she hadn&#39;t missed anything, and promptly started having a screaming fit. She tried desperately to think of a plan as she scrolled through the microtag trackers in the bodycams - another security measure for the people the DIA were supposed to protect - and found that the off-duty jumped-up gropo had returned to Rudi&#39;s-<br><br>Good. That could work.<br><br>---<br><br>A few minutes later, a fat-looking white pigeon with a tag on its leg declaring to to be one &quot;Speckled Jim&quot; sped into the room like a bullet and perched atop Wobbles&#39; comically oversized clown wig.<br><br>&quot;Huh? Oh, heya buddy!&quot; Wobbles stroked the bird along its back and fished in her pockets for some seed. &quot;Who&#39;ve you got for me today?&quot;<br><br>At the chorus of baffled expressions, Wobbled looked slightly guilty. &quot;I, uh, I can&#39;t subscribe to message boards. I&#39;ve got AAT - so, um, technology and I are really, really not friends - so when I signed up for Hugbox they set me up with a carrier pigeon! Oh, uh, Hugbox is kind of like an app where people go over and give each other a hug, some reassurance, you know, all that kinda thing, so of <i>course</i> I wanted to be part of it! Thank you, Mister Pigeon!&quot; With that, she reversed and pedaled her way over to the Guardsman, who was promptly wrapped up in a tight hug.<br><br>At around head level.<br><br>Wobbles was content to do so until she heard the familiar crackle of multicoloured flames.</p>

Don&#39;t be surprised if your voice suddenly changes. You said you regenerated a day ago, right? I regret to inform you that this is the PPC-- time runs weirdly here. You can even feel it too:  do you notice that little movement under your feet? How it seems like you&#39;re on a moving boat even if you&#39;re standing still? That&#39;s HQ&#39;s timeline that&#39;s running in several different directions at the same time. I have no idea why it&#39;s that way. I should really start investigating that.&quot;<br><br>The Guardsman swapped his laser screwdriver for his balloon screwdriver and idly waved it around. &quot;That&#39;s some pretty impressive work, Wobbles. D&#39;you think you can teach me how to do that sometime? Preferably when the Notary isn&#39;t around because I have a feeling she just declared a one-woman-war on me over our little incident.&quot;</p>

            <p>&quot;It&#39;s mostly about the transfer of unwanted memories or even causing some sort of mental feedback loop or something. Let&#39;s say I wanted to show you memories of my first TARDIS flight: if I just thought about the memory in general and tried to transfer it to you I&#39;d probably let loose an entire torrent of all sorts of stuff into your mind. Case in point: you learned about Lola. You gotta clamp down on other thoughts and just let <i>that particular one</i> trickle though.

            <p>&quot;You got questions, I&#39;ve got answers,&quot; said the Guardsman. &quot;Well, most of the time. If you asked me how to fix a TARDIS I <i>could</i> show you that but you&#39;d need...&quot; He scratched his chin. &quot;Say... a background in variable dimensional fields... transcendental mechanics... zero-point mathematics... the standard set of lectures on Vortex dynamics... oh, five hundred years of study at the Academy. But you&#39;re one of us now!&quot; He clapped her on the shoulder. &quot;You&#39;ve got more than enough time on your hands. Hah, get it? Time? No, that was a rubbish joke. Forget it. Speaking of time, though... how old are you? You don&#39;t look ever twenty. Total, I mean. You&#39;re like a toddler! Imagine! Twenty years old and you didn&#39;t even look into the Vortex yet. No, wait. You were human. Right. I forgot that. Never mind. Speaking of which, that&#39;s something that everyone should to in their lives. Definitely not safe for your mind but it&#39;s one helluva experience.&quot;<br><br>He paused. &quot;Oh, just tell me if I&#39;m rambling. I have a tendency to go off on never-ending tangents.

            <p>&quot;Provided you don&#39;t pull a Doctor and blow through over half of your regenerations in the span of a millennium you can easily live to be several thousand years old and only use up... say... five or six regenerations.&quot; The Guardsman clapped his hands. &quot;Oh, that&#39;s right. You already spent one from that mission. Okay, that takes off about 800 years off your lifespan right there.And this is the PPC, too. Okay, make that several accidental deaths in the field in a very short period of time... Yeah. The Doctor&#39;s lifespan actually seems right for PPC agents. You&#39;ve got maybe 3000 years if you stay here, more if you retire. At least you&#39;re not fighting a Time War: I knew this one guy who wasted all of his regenerations during the Omega Campaign. Damned fool couldn&#39;t keep his head down for five minutes.&quot;</p>

            <p>&quot;You&#39;re being torn apart and reassembled on a cellular level while your metabolism burns though an inherently unstable form of energy all while remaining conscious. Of course it hurts! Then again, I&#39;ve only in-the-Alpha-timeline regenerated twice: once during the War after I was pulverized by a falling Dalek and the other time when I fell through a plothole into the Vortex and burnt to death. In my opinion, the actual method of dying was far more painful than regeneration. The latter is more like a release. You&#39;ll never really get used to it-- I mean how can you? It&#39;s only going to happen to you a dozen times, tops.&quot;<br><br>The Guardsman pointed at his hat. &quot;But you know what&#39;s the coolest thing we found out about regenerations? Your next face isn&#39;t &#39;set&#39;. During the War we all had our headcams recording, right? So when we died our memories were sent to a server on Gallifrey for safekeeping. The way those data packets were stored made them immune to the shifting timelines: that meant that at the end of the day the guy sitting next to you at the mess could&#39;ve died a thousand different deaths but never be aware of it until he checked his data cache. Every could&#39;ve-been death, all those moments that never were, all of those meanwhiles lived on in the headcam videos. That eventually became a problem,&quot; said the former soldier, grimacing, &quot;but that&#39;s besides the point. Get this: your next face is totally random. In other timelines I saw myself come back either short, tall, white skinned, yellow-skinned, young, old-- needless to say those particular Emirans didn&#39;t last long-- as a woman or even with an extra head. I saw the vids for that timeline. Gods, that guy never shut up. But that was always Emiran two to Emiran three-- the next face isn&#39;t a constant.&quot;<br><br>- - -<br><br>((And yes, that&#39;s my personal theory as to the nature of the Could&#39;ve-Been King and his army of Meanwhiles and Never-Weres: they were literally echoes of the past resonating into the Alpha timeline and wreaking havoc on the fabric of spacetime.)) </p>

            <p>&quot;Welcome to the good life. Thriving off only a couple hours&#39; worth of sleep, being able to read books in an instant, perfect recall, and incredible longevity. You&#39;d be overqualified for any job back on Earth, guaranteed!&quot; He paused. &quot;Wait. <i>Can</i> you even go back or are you stuck here with us for all eternity? Can&#39;t you just use the D.O.R.K.S and pretend this never happened? Or even better-- hang on a moment.&quot; <br><br>The Guardsman reached into a pocket and pulled out a notebook. He thumbed though it and showed Rina a page covered in Circular Gallifreyan. The symbols quickly rearranged themselves into a legible form under the DMS agent&#39;s gaze. &quot;This is a morph cube from the <i>Animorphs</i> continuum,&quot; said the Guardsman. &quot;It allows a user to absorb DNA from living beings and to full-on become that particular creature for up to two hours. If you spend more than two hours in morph, you&#39;re permanently locked to that form and can&#39;t morph anymore. I&#39;m not sure if it can work with Gallifreyan biology but... if you got your hands on one and a sample of your old DNA...&quot;</p>

Mine was three years ago (ish) at my church, of all places. It was the end of the year and the instructor said we could either have a long chat about what worked and what didn&#39;t that year or watch Doctor Who. <br><br>We compromised and watched an episode after a fifteen, twenty-minute chat. I had some trouble figuring out what was going on, of course, but I knew I was in for a weird ride when the Cthulhu-like alien shocked a guy in the head with its translator orb.

            <p>They were bothering me to watch it, so I bought the DVD for Series 1. I finsished it in about a week and then watched the rest of the new series in the next few weeks. Still havent seen all of Classic Who, but I intend to eventually. Nine was my first Doctor, and still my favorite.</p>

            <p>When I was about 12 or 13, my parrents saw Doctor Who come on aganin, not having watched it for years and only vaguely remembering it from their youth. They called me to come watch because &quot;it was this real fun sci-fi show&quot;. Unfortunately, the episode being aired that night was the (in)famous <i>Blink</i>. After that experience, I never really dared getting into it again, as the nightmares lasted a couple of months...</p>

            <p>I think I went out to a club one night, and I woke up on a friend&#39;s couch holding a pirated Doctor Who DVD my friend told me I had bought while stumbling home. So, we popped in the DVD player, and while the Chinese subtitles wouldn&#39;t go away, it was good enough that I later checked it out on Netflix. Forgot what I did with the DVD, though. That was a good day.</p>

            <p>Nah, kidding.<br><br>Okay, first off, the Doctor isn&#39;t a scientist, and he&#39;s not a doctor, either. Well, he has an honorary doctorate and a PHD in cheesemaking, but that&#39;s neither here nor there. He&#39;s  an alien species called a Time Lord, and the explanation for his different actors is that, whenever something happens that would normally kill him, instead of dying, he regenerates into a new body. (This is applicable to all Time Lords.)<br><br>The cute robot sounds like K-9, a companion of the Fourth Doctor&#39;s who made a reappearance during the Tenth Doctor&#39;s run. K-9 is just one of many companions the Doctor has had (though most of them were human females); while travelling time and space for centuries, you do get lonely.<br><br>The time travel machine is the TARDIS (stands for Time And Relative Dimensions In Space), and though most TARDISes have a nifty thing called a Chameleon Circuit that lets them disguise themselves for something setting-appropriate, the Doctor&#39;s TARDIS stays as a blue police box for most of the time since the Chameleon Circuit is a wee bit broken. Plus he&#39;s grown fond of the blue box.<br><br>The whole thing started as an edutainment show (you know, teach history and science), but it quickly evolved into pure sci-fi goodness. <br><br>I really recommend you give it a try. New Who (Ninth Doctor and up) is on Netflix, and Classic Who is on Hulu. </p>

            <p>First it has been running since 1963 and follows the adventures of a Renegade Time Lord from the planet Gallifrey, his TARDIS (Time and Relative Dimension in Space), a time traveling space ship.  The Doctor travels with Companions going on adventures through Space and Time, sometimes going on misadventures and usually saving the World, Time, Universe, and/or Reality from the likes of Cybermen (Human Brain, Cybernetic Body, usually no emotions), Daleks (Mass murdering hate filled creatures in a high tech battle suit), Other Renegade Time Lords, many other threats, and occasionally the Devil.  There is also a lot of Wibbily Wobbily Timey Wimey Stuff going on.  <br><br>The show runners are not afraid to deal with complex themes/messages including worlds without preset sexual orientations, genders, and roles.  There is also, in my opinion, a strong anti-war message, but it does not come across as preachy.  <br><br>Really though at its core it is a bunch of misadventures through time and space.  Sometimes with a lead that is basically a crazy Man-Child.  Though at least some of the more recent iterations are a bit heavier thematically.<br><br>Now that I realize it, it really is kind of hard to explain any beyond just go watch it.  With over 50 years behind it, there are quite a lot of various intricacies and probably too many to list here.    Though I think if you really want to know what Doctor Who is about, I would recommend watching <i>The Girl in the Mirror </i>.  That episode in my opinion really does kind of capture the essence of the Doctor. </p>

            <p>New Who is on Netflix under Doctor Who 2005, All but the most recent season is there.  It is listed as series though.  And the episodes I have mentioned are all there.  Classic Who is only partly on Netflix, but I believe it might be on Hulu.  I recommend starting with New Who, because the special effects from the 60s might be a bit hard to stomach for some.</p>

            <p>It was the episode with the Aztecs. I remember quickly losing interest because it wasn&#39;t in color. ^^; Silly, twelve year-old me.<br><br>My second time watching the series was about two years ago, when I was fifteen, starting at the beginning of New Who. The Ninth Doctor sucked me in, and I&#39;ve been working my way through Classic Who. I&#39;ve been making a fair bit of headway in the downtime before Capaldi&#39;s next season.</p>

            <p>The Appleland-Bananaville oligarchy has expended a lot of manpower to put up checkpoints every mile along the road between the two cities. Each checkpoint will need at least two shifts of at least two guards each; more likely it&#39;ll be three shifts. Actually, add a fourth to account for holidays and weekends (though I suppose those power-hungry plutocrats may not allow their guards to <i>take</i> holidays). Thats eight thousand guards - and eight thousand salaries - along a single road.<br><br>So I&#39;ll be taking the back-roads, on the assumption that they can&#39;t have done such a ridiculous thing on <i>all</i> the routes.<br><br>Actually, since Top Gear is off the air again, I&#39;ll borrow their music and modify my truck using common objects (readily available in Appleland) to make it suitable for off-road driving. Then I&#39;ll go through the countryside.<br><br>ALTERNATELY: I start a revolution. The military-industrial dictatorship of the A-B government is not going to be popular in the cities - not if they impose such heavy taxes on any transshipments within their own country. The fact that they&#39;ve seen it necessary to create such a massive &#39;guard&#39; force (really, who believes they&#39;re anything but professional solders? You&#39;ve already told us they&#39;ll shoot people who try to get a basic education on sight!) is only further proof of this. I trade one whole load of 1000 apples around (fresh food is going to be rare, with those ridiculous transshipment &#39;taxes&#39;), create a core cadre of dedicated revolutionaries, and spark off a mob riot. While the &#39;guards&#39; - of which there are doubtless many in the city, to match the ludicrous numbers along the road - confront the protestors in their usual ruthless fashion, the cadre will raid their stations for weapons.<br><br>Actually, we might be better to take the mob up against the mile-checkpoints, instead. We know they&#39;re fairly lightly-manned, and we can get at least two guns from each. Heck, I&#39;ll even transport the revolutionaries in my truck - gives us the advantage of surprise.<br><br>Down with the Appleland-Bananaville dictatorship! Power to the people! Fresh fruit for all!<br><br>The People&#39;s hS</p>

Shall we play again?<br><br>I have trapped you in a room, which only unlocks for one minute every 45 minutes. Try to open the door before the time, and you get electrocuted. However, I have left you with two ropes and a lighter. Each rope takes exactly one hour to burn. These ropes are not identical, nor are they uniform, meaning it does not necessarily take half an hour for half the rope to burn. With only these two ropes and a way to light them, how do you measure out the 45 minutes?</p>

            <p>Obviously, the Riddler&#39;s suggestion that we time 45 minutes is a false lead: we don&#39;t know when the door <i>last</i> unlocked! So what we do instead is this:<br><br>There are two methods by which we might get electrocuted. One, and the simplest, is that the door handle is electrified. The other is that the floor of the room electrifies if you try the handle. Both of these can be avoided with reference to one fact: rope does <i>not</i> conduct electricity.<br><br>(The two other methods are non-starters. Electricity can&#39;t be transmitted wirelessly in such a way that you could electrocute someone, and a wired tazer system would need cameras for aiming - which are easy to break)<br><br>So: tie one rope around the handle in such a way that we can use it to check whether it&#39;s locked. The best option is if we can apply constant pressure, but pulling it every so often is fine too. If all else fails, we&#39;ll take the rope apart and wrap the strands around our hand to make a shock-proof &#39;glove&#39;, but that&#39;s probably unnecessary. Depends on the design of the handle.<br><br>The second rope we coil up and stand on, to insulate us from the floor. We know it&#39;s either long or thick enough for this, because it takes an hour to burn! That&#39;s quite a lot of rope.<br><br>Then, protected from electrocution, we cheerfully test the handle until we find the door is unlocked.<br><br>Then we find something flammable and set fire to the Riddler&#39;s stronghold. After all, we have to use the lighter for <i>something</i>. ^_~<br><br>hS</p>

I am most certainly not currently scrambling to make sure my traps are all primed to take out the Batman.<br><br>Speaking of the Batman, let me tell you a story about him!<br><br>The Joker and I had managed to kidnap Batman, Wonder Woman, and the Flash. Joker, being the psychopath that he is, wanted to kill them off as soon as possible. I, however, am a reasonable criminal. I always give my victims a chance. So, I cut them a deal: I would let them go, if they could solve one of my riddles.<br><br>I lined all three of them up one in front of the other, all facing forward, like so: The Flash &gt; Batman &gt; Wonder Woman. Then, I put hats on their heads. I informed them that the hats were either green or purple, and there was at least one of each color. They could see the colour of the hats in front of them, but not their own. I told them, they were not allowed to communicate in any way between each other. If one of them could guess the color of their own hat, all three were free to go. If they couldn&#39;t, I let the Joker have his fun.<br><br>They are given 30 minutes. No one said anything for the longest time, when at the last minute, Batman figured out what his hat color was! True to my word, they were all freed, and the Joker and I were sent back to Arkham. <br><br>How did the Batman do it?</p>

            <p>Here is how it goes.  Wonder Woman can see both Batman and the Flash&#39;s hat, as she is last in line.  Flash and Batman must have different color hats or else Wonder Woman would have been correctly able to guess her hat.  Now when time has nearly elapsed Batman now knows that Wonder Woman has not called her color.  Ergo, his hat is not the same color as Flash.  He can see Flash&#39;s hat and knows that his must be different. </p>

To leave the island, one must know their own eye color. There are no reflective surfaces on the island and no on can communicate with each other other than the leader to the residents. No one on the island knows how many of each eye color there is. Every morning the leader gives anyone a chance to leave the island by guessing their eye color. One morning, the leader gathers all 200 residents to make an announcement, he says &quot;at least 1 person on this island has blue eyes&quot; How many people leave the island and in how many days after the announcement?</p>

            <p>Because you are right again.<br><br>Let us try another story.<br><br>A king has 1,000 barrels of wine stored in his cellar. Unfortunately, the guards found an assassin that had snuck in last night and poisoned exactly one of the barrels. Even 1 drop of poisoned wine would be enough to kill a man, but the poison takes 30 days before becoming fatal, give or take a few hours. The poison is colorless, odorless, and victims show exactly 0 signs of being poisoned in the 30 days prior to dying. There is absolutely no way to detect the poison.<br><br>In 31 days time, there will be a grand feast in which the king will need as much of the wine as possible. He has 10 prisoners on which to test the wine. His first idea is to give each prisoner a drop from 100 barrels of wine, and then when 1 prisoner dies, throw out all 100 barrels of which the dead prisoner drank from. However his jester speaks up and explains a solution that will pinpoint exactly which barrel is poisoned using only the 10 prisoners.<br><br>What was the jester&#39;s solution?</p>

            <p>First, divide the barrels up into groups of ten, numbered 1-10. For each group, each prisoner (A-J) drinks from two barrels, sharing one with the prisoner to his left and the other with the prisoner to his right. Rotate who drinks from what barrels; for instance, in the first round, A drinks from barrels 1 and 2; in the second round, he drinks from 2 and 3; etc. When this can no longer be done without repetition, switch up the order of the prisoners so that they&#39;re sharing with different people.<br><br>If my mind hasn&#39;t gone completely off the rails, it should be possible for only two prisoners to share the poisoned barrel, and assuming the scribes have done their jobs, which two it is that die should pinpoint the barrel.<br><br>It works for up to 100 barrels before I stop being able to visualize it... at least, I&#39;m pretty sure it does. Probably. Definitely works for ten men and ten barrels, at the very least. &gt;.&gt;<br><br>~Neshomeh, who was an English major for a reason, dangit.</p>

            <p>Number the barrels 1-1000 in Binary.  Give each prisoner a number equivalent to one of the positions in the binary number.  Each Barrel if it contained the poison would leave a different combination of prisoners dead as each Binary Number is unique.  So ultimately they go and see which prisoners are dead.  That would correspond to a 1 in the binary code.  That would give what the binary code looks like and you can find the barrel that way.<br><br>And I do not know.  Should you be concerned?   </p>

            <p>The Emperor of China decided to test his staff to find the wiser ones, so he put them into two groups. Both groups were put in separate rooms, and both received a wide round table of the best food and drink, but the catch was that each man had to sit three feet away from the table. This was because they all had to eat the food with chopsticks that were three feet long.<br><br>The Emperor told them he would come back in an hour to see how much food they had eaten. When he finally returned, the first group was angry, frustrated and hungry. On the contrary, the second group was happy and well-fed. What caused the difference?</p>

Since you haven&#39;t stated that they&#39;re all the same size, I&#39;ll also measure them and calculate their volumes. From their masses and volumes, I can calculate their density.<br><br>Apples and oranges are roughly the same size; we can therefore assume that they will pack in 3D space in virtually the same way, and that a mixture of the two will do so as well.<br><br>Apples and oranges have a different density. Therefore, our three boxes will have three different densities: the one in the middle will be apples+oranges, while the most and least dense will be homogeneous.<br><br>I suspect that the apples will be densest, but we don&#39;t need to make that assumption: take a single piece of fruit from the densest box.

            <p>You never told me I couldn&#39;t, just that I can&#39;t REACH into more than one.<br><br>Alternately, I throw two boxes away, and check to see what I&#39;ve got left.<br><br>I shake all three boxes. One of them will make a horrible squishing sound as the apples smash the oranges. I then check one of the other two and label all three correctly.<br><br>I leave the crates for a week and sniff them. Rotting apples and rotting oranges smell totally different.<br><br>I slap the labels on at random. Well, you never said you wanted them on the corresponding boxes at the end.<br><br>Ehm... given that you&#39;ve implied the labels are currently on the boxes and are all &#39;mixed up&#39;, that suggests no box is correctly labelled. I check one box. Let&#39;s say it&#39;s apples. I take the label off the box that&#39;s labelled apples and stick it on there. Then, since I know that the labels are all wrong, I take the remaining label off its box, stick it on the one I just cleared, and stick my spare on the last box.<br><br>I make up three labels saying &#39;FRUIT&#39;, stick them on, then reach in and have myself a snack. ^_^ All this labelling is making me hungry! (Man, I hope it&#39;s an orange...)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>The Rose bashing in the second one is really egregious.  I mean, I don&#39;t care for her much, but I was completely disgusted by the way the Sue was treating her.<br><br>I really like the way you&#39;re handling Rina.  One thing that I think is hard with Time Lord characters is making their regenerations have distinct <i>personalities</i>, but still having them be the same <i>person</i>.

            <p>1) <i>“Wait, who’s turn was it last time?” said Sarah.</i><br>&quot;Whose&quot;, not &quot;who&#39;s&quot;.<br><br>2) <i>The terrified ex-Sue plot-holed away, and [MUTO] smashed into another building and killed 23 more people.</i><br>Generally, numbers should be spelled out. However, I&#39;d like to have someone else weigh in on this as well, since it&#39;s clear that you&#39;re mocking an earlier line from the badfic.<br><br>3) <i>Seizing his long snout with one clawed forepaw, he proceeded to rip into the struggling replacement’s furry chest with the other to get him to stop moving. Then, grabbing his mouth, he forced it open, the glow already starting to spread to the plates on his back.</i><br>This paragraph confused me. In context, I can tell what you&#39;re going for, but the paragraph itself has a few issues:<br><br>a) <i>Seizing his long snout with one clawed forepaw, he proceeded to rip into the struggling replacement’s furry chest with the other to get him to stop moving.</i><br>It&#39;s clear from context that the mini-Godzilla is supposed to be the actor here. However, I doubt that Sonic&#39;s snout can plausibly be described as long. Couple that with the massive amount of pronouns, and this sentence can be a pain to muddle through. I&#39;d suggest deleting &quot;long&quot; and replacing the &quot;he&quot; with the mini&#39;s name.<br><br>b) <i>Then, grabbing his mouth, he forced it open, the glow already starting to spread to the plates on his back.</i><br>Common sense would dictate that the mini would have to let go of MUTO!Sonic&#39;s chest so that he could use both hands to force the replacement&#39;s mouth open. However, the sentence structure implies that the mini is holding on to MUTO!Sonic&#39;s chest <i>and</i> forcing the replacement&#39;s mouth open at the same time--a physical impossibility. Consider this fix:<br><br><i>The mini-Godzilla then grabbed the replacement&#39;s mouth and forced it open, the glow already starting to spread to the plates on the mini&#39;s back.</i><br><br>4) Speaking of minis, one more question: How is &quot;Cloverfield&quot; a mini? Not knowing the canon, it looks correctly spelled to me.</p>

            <p>1) Fixed.<br>2) The satire of the badfic dialogue was intentional on my part. I&#39;ll probably keep the numbers as-is to drive the point home.<br>3) These two sentences have been changed to the following: <i>Seizing MUTO’s snout with one clawed forepaw, the angry mini proceeded to rip into the struggling replacement’s furry chest with the other to get him to stop moving. He then grabbed MUTO&#39;s mouth and forced it open, the glow already starting to spread to the plates on his back.</i><br>4) Referring to the character as Cloverfield produces a mini because the monster&#39;s production name was Clover. So it would be techncically incorrect to refer to it via the film&#39;s title.</p>

            <p>I had the crazy idea while writing this to grow the minis up to the size of Godzilla himself to deal with MUTO!Sonic as is, but shrinking him directly would&#39;ve resulted in less collateral damage. Uh, relatively speaking. XD</p>

            <p>Look at me, writing (what I think is) ConCrit. I do apologise if the tone&#39;s a bit harsh, I&#39;ve some problems with not saying things bluntly.<br>First things first, the exposition about Godzilla&#39;s moral is a bit ham-handed, it could be toned down with no loss of interaction or characterisation.<br>Second, I&#39;m uncomfortable with Sarah and Lapis mentioning their author. Most PPC Agents don&#39;t know they&#39;re characters. There&#39;s a reason <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Swan%27s_Egg">Swan&#39;s Egg</a> is a big deal, after all.<br>Third, capitalisation minis are frowned upon, as far as I&#39;m aware.<br>Fourth, I think that missions don&#39;t need soundtracks. Those notes just throw you out of the story, and anyway a good story stands on its one even without attaching music to it. A story isn&#39;t isn&#39;t a movie.<br>Fifth, Lapis&#39; rant near the start of act two could use with some toning down – that&#39;s Excessive Emphasis right there.<br>Sixth – I mislike Cupid&#39;s sudden Genre Savvy. Isn&#39;t he a ditz? That simply doesn&#39;t fit.<br>Seventh – urm, I think if a Stu throws an agent OOC, they&#39;d be under the Aura of Smooth and generally dizzy, not up-and-about...?<br>Eighth – I hope Lapis using her Sue powers will have consequences later on. Agents aren&#39;t supposed to rely on Sue powers.<br>Ninth – I&#39;m pretty sure it&#39;s meant to be “Excuse me” and not “Excuse you” (near the start of the post-mission part).</p>

            <p>I don&#39;t think it&#39;s fair to say that agents recruited from a fic shouldn&#39;t be aware that they <i>were</i> characters in a story.  In fact, given that terms like &quot;ex-Sue,&quot; &quot;bit character,&quot; and &quot;semi-fic blip&quot; are common classifications, it seems unlikely they&#39;d be able to avoid it.  However, in PPC terms, that doesn&#39;t make them any less real.  Directly referencing authors is a step farther than most take it, <br><br>I haven&#39;t read all of Swan&#39;s Egg, but based on <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=1_ihWWILnaY4myUshaWpAN-rd4ATFXg7UMXYTOevngXs">Huinesoron&#39;s comments</a>, it&#39;s about agents discovering the <i>PPC</i> is fictional.  And while we know that the author they mention is the same one who is writing them now, in-setting only the first level of metafiction is available. </p>

            <p>I&#39;ll fix up all the stuff tonight or tomorrow; I have to study again.<br><br>Anyway, yeah, I&#39;ll concede that I overdid Lapis&#39; fangirling over Gidzilla - it was a bit of foreshadowing for her adverse reaction to the fic, though a few less sentences could do.<br><br>Sarah was told of her author by Falchion near the end of the mission where she was recruited, and Falchion discovered that he was an author&#39;s persona before then. As for Lapis, well... I&#39;ll answer that in due course. ;)<br><br>My beta didn&#39;t thiunk the no-caps justice league wasn&#39;t valid as a mini, but I&#39;m not sure if the capital mini thing is a case-by-case basis or a general principle.<br><br>The rant could do with some de-emphasis, but the core element - Lapis losing it more than the others expected. The dialogue in general can also be patched up here and there, so my agents don&#39;t go OOC (especially not under the Aura of Smooth).<br><br>IIRC, Lapis accidentally plot-holed the agents into a wall on her first mission (though that may have been due to Cupid distracting her in the process). I&#39;ll try to find a way to deconstruct it in later missions. I hope.</p>

It&#39;s really, really vague because you&#39;re seeing all of these potential timelines at the same time but you can get a gut feeling for someone else&#39;s future. For example...&quot; the Guardsman scanned the pub. His eyes settled on a nondescript young man sitting alone at a table. &quot;The kinda ugly bowtie guy over there. Look at him. Think about his future. Can you see where he will be in one week&#39;s time? One year?

            <p>Valon gulped down a slice of his Buddhist pizza and reiterated his question. &quot;Overpowered Sues? Considering what we killed cleaning up the mess, I&#39;m guessing that yes, Rose was overpowered. And I know what overpowered Stus are like. I had to kill a replacement of a character who canonically survived a nuclear warhead. In a continuum that <i>didn&#39;t</i> have the materials to take him down. On my second mission. Yeah.

            <p>Well, I have read a lot of bad fanfic before. Sadly, the worst I have ever read no longer exists. Here is the basic rundown:<br><br>A Red and Black Alicorn OC (tm) becomes such after making a deal with the Devil. No, not some pony Devil, our Devil. He broke through the Fourth Wall, and came to our world, summoned Satan, and became a demon. Sort of. In reality, he has a demon trapped in his hooves. No, this is not a metaphor. It is quite literally trapped in his hooves.<br><br>So, now with a massive gash in time and space, religion comes to Equestria. Satanism and Christianity to be precise. Absolutely no other religions come over. At all. Now because of Christanity coming to Equestria, same sex marriage is banned in most places except Ponyville. Because. Reasons. Also, modern military weapons and tactics come to Equestria and they are now at war with:<br>a. griffons<br>b. changelings<br>c. another pony race<br><br>If you guessed a, NO DUH! It&#39;s <i>always</i> the griffons!<br><br>So, Gary Stu is a Modern Major General, who threatens to gut people with his katana if they misbehave. He is the most skilled swordsman ever in pony history. His katana was his cutie mark before his deal with the devil. Now it has 666 behind it.<br><br>Oh, this is all just beginning though! Turns out Pinkie is possessed by a demon. You get one guess as for what demon!Pinkie does. If it was anything other then make Cupecakes, you do not know MLP badfic. Turns out, ponies know she kills ponies and makes them into baked goods! It&#39;s OK! That&#39;s. Just. <i>Pinkie!</i><br><br>No, let me rant some more. Those three words are used everywhere. Gary Stu hunts down Pinkamena, but most ponies don&#39;t see it as demonic possession. They see it as Pinkie just being Pinkie! Yep, crazy Pinkie Pie, always throwing parties, making balloons appear out of nowhere, and <i>killing ponies to eat!</i> That&#39;s just <i>her,</i> you know!? <br><br>And Gary Stu, oh, Gary Stu has the seventh Element of Harmony. Whoda think, there was another one. Turns out, element number seven, the mission element that represents an aspect of Friendship amongst others? DARKNESS! Because that&#39;s what we need!<br><br>This fic is one of the worst, on so many levels. The Stu is so OP he makes Rose Potter look weak, the religion bashing is over the top, almost every character is OOC, and it tries so hard to be funny but it just FAILS!<br><br>Reading back over this, this is just a huge rambling rant on my part. I am going to leave it the way it is. I hate this fic. Yet, at the same time, I wish it was still around. It was <i>perfect</i> mission material, and not because of how much I hate it. I saw so many gags, moments for character interaction, exploring how Pinkamena could exist after the Cupcakes mission, just... So many wonderful things to mission in here. But now, it is gone. I still have a copy. Perhaps, if I get very bored, I might mission it anyway, for myself. It is such a shame you all will never be able to read the worst fic I ever read:<br><br>Pinkamena, the Pink Shadow.</p>

            <p>And it really is prime mission material. It was like some unholy mixture of every single bad MLPfic trope, brewed in the deepest darkest parts of the Pit. It was like the author looked at a list of what not to do in fanfiction, and used it as a checklist! PC, I can feel you glaring disapprovingly, but I swear, I&#39;m not just saying this out of anger. I had so many gags, exploration of characters and themes, everything! It was going to be epic! But...<br><br>Well, it was deleted. And it&#39;s just darn rude to mission a fic that was taken down for a reason, you know? Still...<br><br>I am leaning towards not missioning it, or if I do, keeping it private. For now, I have to get My Little Unicorn finished first. Which, speaking of horrid fanfic... Ah, another day. </p>

I&#39;ve never fully read it because It&#39;s 41 chapters and that, to me, seems too long. Also the author of this fic wastes two chapters to explain her fic (uses a big chunk of it to defend her oc) and to explain the Japanese words she uses, both of those chapters were unnecessary.</p>

            <p>To put it in context - I don&#39;t get squicked out at stuff. I just tend to get angry more than anything else, and sometimes I forget that other people don&#39;t react the same way to more, ahem, <i>outré</i> pieces of fiction. I&#39;ve read <i>The 120 Days of Sodom</i> (what of it de Sade completed). Mostly, I find it fascinating what the human mind is capable of. Also that we desire balance so much - compare the rash of MLP shockfics to the festival of kittens and snuggles that is (my experience of) the PMMM fandom&#39;s outpourings - but that might well be confirmation bias on my part, Iunno. =]</p>

I suppose you all don&#39;t care about spoilers to a (unofficially) Legendary Badfic, do you? Good.<br><br>In the end, Trixie leads a revolution, and wins! All of the royalty involved in the sick things that occur in the fic are put to be executed. How? By having them turned to stone by a cockatrice, then killing the cockatrice. This does not kill them, per se. Rather, it traps them as living statues, unable to move, unable to act, and forced to watch as the world continues without them. They have no mouths, and they must scream.<br><br>I won&#39;t lie, that last chapter was very cathartic. The evil people were defeated, and punished severely for it. Is it enough for what they did? No. But it is almost as close as you can get. Yet... why is it that torturing and killing these people is morally justified, while everyone else&#39;s deaths were seen as the worst acts of humanity? The entire point of Blueblood&#39;s little club was taking part in all of the possible pleasures that we deny ourselves because of &quot;morality.&quot; We say, these people are monsters. Rightfully so, might I add. And yet, how did I feel when they killed Blueblood? It was darn near erotic. My soul was so full of justice, I could burst! It was an almost sexual pleasure. Now, wait a minute...<br><br>I don&#39;t know, maybe I&#39;m insane, but there seems to be something of value here in this piece of garbage smut. Something worth analyzing, and taking a second look at. If I could muster a second look, that is.</p>

There&#39;s this series, Higurashi no Naku Koro Ni.<br><br>In this series, a lot of the crazy going around town is caused by a disease, Hinamizawa Syndrome, that induces psychosis, paranoia, anxiety, and ultimately leads to victims clawing their throats out, due to a sensation of insects crawling under their skin.<br><br>The disease has something to do with entering the town itself.<br><br>Question: Wouldn&#39;t this make it <i>really freaking dangerous</i> for agents to work in the When They Cry continuum?

            <p>...although not in this particular context. Specifically, my concern when the idea first came to me was how agents might be protected from zombie plagues (&#39;cause they don&#39;t all spread through bites, you know). It then expanded to more conventional diseases as well as chemical weapons and exposure to radiation.<br><br>While I never actually wrote anything up (apart from a mention of Laura going through a decontamination process after suffering an open wound in the <i>Fallout</i> universe), I have a few theories/suggestions. First, the aforementioned decon process. Agents that have been exposed to something nasty would be immediately shunted to Medical when they portal back to HQ. They go through a chain of showers, genetic scanners, and medical tests before being certified as clean.<br><br>Secondly, perhaps their disguises offer some measure of protection against biological unpleasantness. How? In the same way that Bleeprin erases bad memories. Don&#39;t think about it, or else it&#39;ll stop working. Not very interesting, but it gets those concerns out of the way.<br><br>Finally, as other people have mentioned, there are always artificial/non-human agents that can be sent in. Perhaps the Flowers have specific teams for ultra-hazardous continuums.<br><br>Like I said, theories and suggestions.</p>

            <p>If all else fails, you could send in a purely synthetic agent, right? I&#39;m not really familiar with this continuum, but as far as I know, diseases don&#39;t generally infect other species, and an agent with a completely different biochemistry would be nearly impossible to infect with a virus from earth. Though it sounds supernatural, this is just my two-cents on the matter. Again, feel free to correct me if I&#39;m wrong, as I said I only have a passing familiarity with Higurashi.</p>

            <p>Seems to indicate that it is actually parasitic in nature.  The lore also includes a prophylactic vaccine C-120.  This, from what I read, seems to be able to prevent it from taking route.  Though that would conflict with the Parasite.  In other words I am not certain.  But acquiring C-120 would probably be the best bet, short of the Hard Suits I mentioned in my other post.  </p>

            <p>For the uninitiated, the Tau from Warhammer 40,000 are the closest thing the setting has to good guys; a young empire focused on technological might and combined-arms warfare that&#39;s only just figuring out how completely out of their depth they are in a universe of insane gods, xenophobic humans, and giant robot skeletons with weapons that literally strip you down to your component atoms in layers.<br><br>Now, a Tau Stealth Suit operator (XV15, before you ask, wouldn&#39;t do to be too OP) is actually a very good and very balanced agent. Why? Because the Tau <i>despise the entire concept of melee combat</i>. XV15 stealth suits are actually pretty rubbish as far as armour goes, relying on - big surprise - their stealth systems to keep them in check. The XV15s were used as scouts by the Tau, especially when equipped with a markerlight - which meant you got even more shot by the guns which are better than bolters. Between this, the fact that they&#39;re very vulnerable to magic/psionics, and the melee-hatred, I think a Tau Shas&#39;ui in an XV15 would be a pretty interesting agent. Though the burst cannon would probably have to be swapped out for something else on numerous occasions. Not every continuum can handle plasma gatlings. =]<br><br>But yeah, XV15s - like all Tau batlesuits - are NBC hardened because Plague Marines are a thing, and I think a suit-jockey would actually want to volunteer for a mission like this. If the entire multiverse is under threat from nightmare abominations (well, more so than usual for 40K), then it surely serves the Greater Good to aid the struggle as best they can.<br><br>Of course, this hypothetical Tau agent would have to be paired with someone like a Klingon or similar Proud Warrior Race to balance out the team and give internal conflict. I&#39;ll get back to you as far as that&#39;s concerned. =]</p>

            <p>First that might pair well with your Tau Agent.  But more to the original question, Krogan (from Mass Effect) are incredibly resistant to almost anything.  Off the top of my head:<br><br>1.  Incredibly resistant to environmental hazards including toxins<br>2.  Redundant biological systems, including a secondary nervous system, which should be able to mitigate the effects of the condition in question.<br><br>As a third note, they are reptilian, and while Human-Animal parasitic transmission occurs, it seems to me that it would be harder if for instance it was say, Fish-Human.

            <p>They render disguises pointless. As long as you have a strong enough SEP field, you could drag Cthulhu into the middle of the Imperial City and people would not even notice him.

            <p>Then I think we may be back to Time Lord.  Regeneration should take care of it.  Or alternatively go supernatural back.  Maybe a true vampire out of Hellsing.  Or might need to go with Shinigami from Bleach.  That could theoretically work.  Or artificial life, such as a Droid.  <br><br>So taking a supernatural base off the top of my head:<br><br>1.  Homunculus from FMA, but by nature of it would have to be a reformed Sue.  <br>2.  Droid from Star Wars Continuum.  Worst case scenario decontaminate the droid then wipe the memory.  Or absolute worst case scenario, just scrap it.<br>3.  Android from Star Trek.  Same idea as droid.<br>4.  Fade Spirit from Dragon Age.  But this would most likely be looking at another reformed Sue.<br>5.  Supernatural Entity, say a vampire like Alucard from Hellsing, or whatever Anderson is.  Problem going this route, runs the risk of creating a Sue.  Their power levels would need substantial curtailment.  <br>6.  Related to number 5,  a Soul Reaper/Shinigami from Bleach&#39;s Continuum.  Seeing as they are spirits that should provide some degree of protection from a supernatural disease.<br><br>But on a side note, having an Agent catch Hinamizawa Syndrome might make an interesting story.  Though it seems like it could spiral into an Emergency quickly.</p>

            <p>Like Alucard from Hellsing.  Basically an Eldritch Abomination in humanoid form.  He can even spawn a massive undead army from all the souls he consumed over the centuries.  He is so overpowered that he basically is erased from existence, then only takes 30 years to get back.  </p>

            <p>Yeah, TV!Alucard is not quite as tough as Manga/OVA Alucard.  I may have to look to see if there is a Replacement!Manga!Alucard.  Finding a way to take him down would be entertaining.  <br><br>Shinigami with Bankai would have a decent shot.  Or the real deal.  Though two Alucards might cause the continuum to implode on itself.  Or kill everything in the continuum.<br><br>When I was reading about the Agent I saw the Heroic Spirit.  That would be capable of doing it.</p>

            <p>I have a few pieces of original fiction that have been sitting on my hard drive for a while.  I plan on doing something with them, there should not be too much, but I am always looking to improve.  I am thinking about creating a site to host all of my fiction, and I want the best product available.  <br><br>I will be honest though, I may also look at publishing through Amazon.  Just figured I would let you know what you might be getting into.  <br><br>They are two short stories. The first is a High Dark Fantasy Story that features a rhyming headless horseman.  The second is Military-Political Thriller featuring an Irish Mercenary working for the Russians.<br><br>There is also an in-progress/abandoned Harry Potter Fanfic, and two legal papers (EU Patent Law and 1st Amendment respectively).<br><br>Ratings advisory:  The original fiction hovers around PG-13/R, language and violence mostly.  The fanfiction at this point is K/T at worst.  The legal papers are well, legal papers.  I will say this, I really want to protect my rights in the original fiction.  <br><br>If anyone is interested, respond with an e-mail and which of the various items you would wish to read.</p>

I am assuming so, as long as they don&#39;t do heroin or something else stupid. It seems odd to allow for gruesome (and satisfying) assassination, but not stoners. Still, felt it best to ask.</p>

I know plenty of people who smoke pot to varying degrees. They&#39;re generally pretty okay. It&#39;s just another potentially-addictive thing people can choose to do responsibly or not, IMO.<br><br>Just, y&#39;know, please avoid basing a character solely on stereotypes. That&#39;s a bad idea regardless of what stereotypes you&#39;re using.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>(By &quot;stoner,&quot; I&#39;m assuming you mean one who uses marijuana. I mention this because that is what will inform the remainder of this post.)<br><br>I don&#39;t have a problem with the idea in theory. We have agents who drink, we have agents who smoke tobacco, and we have agents who engage in other bad habits. Based on the research I have read and the evidence I have seen, marijuana use is hardly going to destroy the PPC.<br><br>That doesn&#39;t mean I have concerns. First off, would this agent be someone who noshes on a hash brownie after a mission to relax or a full on Tommy Chong/Seth Rogan &quot;blaze it up 4/20&quot; dude? If it is closer to the later, I should point out that being that stoned would probably interfere with one&#39;s duties at least a little bit.<br><br>Secondly, I should point out that &quot;stoner agent&quot; really isn&#39;t much of a concept. It tells me nothing about their personality unless you intend to follow the traditional stoner stereotypes (which I would advise against, due to how dull and hackneyed it could be). You can&#39;t really base a fleshed-out character solely around the fact that they use drugs. It should be a facet of who they are, not the crux.</p>

            <p>Drug use is a serious problem for both the (ab)user and the people around them.

            <p>I&#39;ve worked with drug users and people recovering from drug use in the past, and they made it quite clear that even things considered to be softer, like marijuana, could have pretty nasty effects and were quite addictive. It&#39;s really not something that I would consider a good thing to have as part of a portrayed agent. Mentions of people who use drugs off-screen would probably be okay.<br><br>I recall one agent in the past who was always trying to get high but never succeeded, and that was due to her characterisation as something of a stoner in her original universe before she was recruited. The point is she was still doing her job without mind-altering substances coursing through her brain and making her (more of) a danger. (In case you were wondering, it was Agent Paddlebrains.)</p>

            <p>I&#39;m afraid I completely disagree. Yes, psychoactive drugs are dangerous. What they <i>aren&#39;t</i> is dangerous to the degree presented by the world&#39;s litany of scaremongers. And frankly, I&#39;m not all that surprised you found recovering addicts harping on about the dangers - there&#39;s no preacher like a recent convert, after all.<br><br>I would not be one bit frelling surprised if more agents turned to something that hits a little harder than booze or a couple of Woodbines than let on. Bleeprin, as we&#39;ve seen countless times before across the history of the PPC, doesn&#39;t work on everything. Every agent has their own damage - it&#39;s almost a requirement for the position - and some people are going to try and self-medicate. So I&#39;m in full support of an agent visibly using drugs, and I urge you in turn to please, please, <i>please</i> leave your Puritanism at the door where it belongs.<br><br>Your War&#39;s over, cob.

            <p>Use is not abuse.<br><br>I cannot stress this enough, and it&#39;s the trap that you and every other person falls into. Use of drugs is not the same thing as abuse of drugs. This is just flat-out <i>wrong</i>. It&#39;s also the fallacy at the heart of American drugs policy, which destroys countless thousands more lives than it purports to save or protect.<br><br>It is my firm belief that drugs should be treated like cigarettes - you know, those things people smoke to get a chemical fix - or alcohol - that liquid people take to get a chemical fix. They should be legal, but misuse should be cracked down on and help should be made available for those who are addicted. It should no longer be driven underground; instead, it should be open, but very tightly regulated for purity and such so that they are safe for the users. You also kick lumps out of the funding for criminal activity, but that&#39;s really just a side benefit compared to the humanitarian issue here.<br><br>And if you seriously belief that adhering to an inflexible, doctrinaire system that harms far more than it helps is part of the <i>social contract</i>, then I don&#39;t really know what else to say.<br><br>Sorry about calling you a Puritan, though. It wasn&#39;t justified, and was intended only to mock and denigrate your position. That&#39;s not what an argument about an issue as serious as this should descend to.</p>

            <p>I think it can cause a lot of internal conflict within the user.  I also think it can set up a good story, the agent and his partner, particularly if the partner is drug adverse.  This can set a very realistic element, and something that is not that far-fetched in my opinion.<br><br>I mean look at it this way, these agents are slogging through some of the worst things on the internet.  That&#39;s enough to cause the need for self-medication.  As an example, look at many attorneys in real life.  They see the worst humanity has to offer, and many turn to drugs, alcohol, etc.<br><br>But I will say that while I think it is doable, maybe fitting the tone of the PPC would be hard unless you resort to the traditional stereotypes.  I would also contend that it needs to be carefully done.  It seems like it would be very easy to turn a character like that into an author soapbox.

Still, a stoner agent trying to hide his drugs from DoIA might be interesting. Could have a Inspector Javert like relationship with a DoIA agent trying to bust the agent for his illegal drugs. Just, try to keep it to the general strength of Marijuana. There are a lot of drugs throughout the multiverse that could mess up a lot of agents real bad. There is a reason why the DoIA is strict with its rules.</p>

            <p>They don&#39;t care about low grade stuff like marijuana, unless an agent is hitting the stuff so hard they can&#39;t do their job, but they&#39;re most definitely stepping in against stuff like crack, meth, slab, heroin, whatever. If you&#39;re dealing stuff that&#39;ll cook your brain inside your skull like an egg or turn you into a drooling vegetable, or has literally lethal withdrawal symptoms (see: a lot of the fictional drugs on the forbidden substances list), they&#39;re cracking down on you. Just like they&#39;ll arrest somebody for getting in a drunken fistfight where someone gets their head busted open, but not for drinking the alcohol in the first place. If you&#39;re a user, you&#39;re probably not going to be thrown in their jail just for that, unless you&#39;ve done something else illegal (hurt another agent, destroyed or stole PPC equipment, threatened the Flowers, whatever), most likely they make you cool your heels in their equivalent of the drunk tank or go to Medical to get the stuff out of your system and deal with any dependencies built up.</p>

There&#39;s stuff that&#39;s <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Forbidden_Substances">forbidden</a> in HQ, so those are right out. For other substances... well, I&#39;ll let more experienced members of the community decide on those. <br><br>These were my two cents.</p>

            <p>The list seems rather... Basic. The information provided about the substances is sparce, and even has some direct falsehoods. For example, it says that crack is another name for cocaine. Crack cocaine and cocaine are two very different substances. Cocaine is refined coca leaves, made into a power form and snorted. Crack is made of battery acid, drain fluid, and all other nasty things. The two are administered the same way, but are very different drugs.<br><br>I think an effort to update the list and expand on the information provided might be a good idea. I am no expert on drugs, (despite my defense for people taking them if they choose, I, myself, choose not to) so I am probably not the best guy to take on the project. However, if somebody else would take it on, I would be very thankful.</p>

            <p>Most people start smoking because they need to relax. The psychedelic nature of the drug helps to make the world a little brighter for them, at the moment. It is near impossible to become physically addicted to marijuana, though a mental problem can arise. For most people, it is a recreational drug they take every once in a while to make the troubles of the world lessen for a while.<br><br>Then, we have bleeprin, a substance that targets bad memories and removes them, with an aspirin kicker to remove the physical pain too. Some of the most addictive substances are pain killers, and bleeprin is, in many ways, the ultimate pain killer. It not only sooths the physical pains of badfic, but removes the memories of what caused it to begin with! We know bleep is far from medicinal, because we mix pseudo alcohol to wash away the pain even more effectively! And what is to stop people from taking it for other mental pains? What about a bad break up? Just pop some pills, and have that that piece of dead weight you lugged arround just wash away. Or the death of a loved one? Now they are not dead. They&#39;re just... gone for a while. A long while. Long enough you&#39;ll never be able to see them again... hold on, just a few more pills.<br><br>Yet, how do we justify it? Well, it&#39;s not addictive. So it&#39;s OK. Right, sure, keep telling yourself that. So, perhaps it&#39;s not physically addictive. Does that mean it&#39;s not able to be abused? Far from it. It is a mind altering substance, somebody is addicted to it. Heck, we joke about how much agents take, trying to make the pain go away. Medical being out of bleep causes riots in the halls! I see time and time again, people joking about how much they abuse this drug. However, once it turns from bleep abuse to cannabis abuse, now it&#39;s a problem? I&#39;m sorry, I just don&#39;t see the real difference. One is fictional, the other is real. And? People can still pick up ideas about what is or is not appropriate behavior around drugs from fictional substances. I see no real difference.</p>

            <p>Bleeprin is essentially consumed in the same context as real-world drugs: it&#39;s a temporary escape from reality. It&#39;s completely outrageous that agents have to wipe their own minds to cope; it contributes to the hellish living conditions agents have to put up with. It&#39;s pathetic, inhumane, and just so over-the-top it becomes funny at the end. <br><br>Bleeprin, marijuana, alcohol, cigarettes... they&#39;re all bad in the end.

            <p>Is that HQ needs a support group for Bleep addicts. Perhaps a sub-division of Medical and FicPsych that comes together to try and help agents get off their Bleep habits. And before anybody says, &quot;how could that be funny,&quot; have you <i>seen</i> any AA meetings in comedy? They can be hilarious! It&#39;s all about the extreme contrast of characters coming together to try and help themselves with a serious problem that nobody else takes seriously.<br><br>Also, I disagree that these issues are no laughing matter. We, as a society, seem to find stoners, alcoholics, and serious smokers very funny. Heck, as a community, we have agreed substance abuse can be funny. You see a lot of the same humor between agents that take Bleeprin and people that drink copious amounts of alcohol to &quot;wash away the pain.&quot; Is substance abuse serious? Yes. Are there consequences for it? Yes. Can we joke about it? Absolutely. </p>

            <p>I can understand why that would cause an author to hesitate before writing a character doing something illegal, but not how we as a community should encourage or discourage behavior of Agents. There is a list of banned substances. Anything that is not on that list, theoretically, is allowed. We, as a community, should offer caution towards characterization. If part of that character is that they are a teetotaler or a druggie, either is fine. What matters is why, and thinking about why, to make a three-dimensional character.</p>

            <p>Should not really have any bearing on whether a character in a piece of fiction can do something.

            <p>&quot;And she&#39;d very much object to being called an &#39;it&#39;!&quot; said the Guardsman, laughing. &quot;Only TB goes by &#39;it&#39;. Quote-- &#39;I am an artificial life form. Biological sex or gender has absolutely no meaning for me&#39;.&quot; The Guardsman mowed through a basket of garlic bread before speaking again. &quot;Like I said, TB usually lives in Naya&#39;s enviro-suit computers. She&#39;s a quarian-- a humanoid race that comes from a planet named Rannoch. Unfortunately for her race, their immune systems are extremely weak compared to other life forms. Now, there&#39;s two reasons for this. Firstly, Rannoch has no insect life. This restricts how viruses and diseases can spread so everything evolved to be symbiotic: quarians adapt around diseases instead of fighting them head-on. Secondly, they&#39;ve been living in aseptic environments for hundreds of years. There was a big geth uprising on Rannoch-- the geth were used as slaves but their AI eventually gained sentience, see-- and the quarians lost the Morning War. Since they couldn&#39;t just colonize any old planet because of their weak immune systems, they travelled around the galaxy in a massive armada while living in bacteria-free suits. A minor infection could actually spell doom for them,&quot; explained the Guardsman. He took a big gulp of water and poured himself another glass.<br><br>&quot;Fortunately, Terabyte and Naya get along very well. It lives in her suit, making minute adjustments to the atmosphere she&#39;s breathing to slowly build up her immune system. According to their numbers, Naya should be able to roam HQ without her suit in five to six years. That being said... I&#39;ve never actually seen Naya&#39;s face. It&#39;s really weird to say this, but that&#39;s the truth. She wears an opaque visor over her face; you can only kinda see her eyes glow behind it. It&#39;s so weird. &quot;<br><br>- - -<br><br>((<a href="http://www.desktopwallpapers4.me/games/talizorah-nar-rayya-mass-effect-26598/"> What they actually look like.</a>))</p>

            <p>&quot;You get absolutely no armour penetration with a primitive thing like that,&quot; said the Guardsman, &quot;unless you&#39;re using a super-heavy pull. Go for a crossbow instead: a quarrel can easily punch though mail or plate. Alternatively, just use a good old-fashioned gunpowder weapon if canon allows it. Well, you did say &#39;fantasy continua&#39;... Probably no guns then. But seriously: learn how to shoot. I don&#39;t know about you but I&#39;d rather have my good old staser rifle in my hands rather than a bow if push comes to shove. It&#39;s literally the difference between life and death in our line of work. Hey, if you ever need a weapon recommendation, I&#39;m your man.&quot;<br><br>- - -<br><br>((Emiranlanoamar, AKA Mr-ask-me-anything-about-guns-and-I-can-write-a-dissertation-for-you))</p>

            <p>&quot;And even if they did, my longbow&#39;s got a ninety pound draw to it. There&#39;s not much it can&#39;t pierce.&quot;<br><br>Rina did look thoughtful, though. &quot;I do know how to shoot guns thanks to my dad, and I was actually pretty good at it. Might not be anymore, though. I&#39;m a bit out of practice. And the Flowers sent us on two <i>Doctor Who</i> missions a few hours ago, so it might be worth looking into getting a staser... I&#39;m assuming there are different models, right? Which would you recommend?&quot;</p>

            <p>He was waiting for someone to ask him this question. He pulled his trusty notebook from his pocket again and opened it to a dog-eared page labelled &quot;D.E.W&quot;. He carefully turned a few pages and stopped once he reached a page marked with a hand-drawn seal of Rassilon. The Gallifreyan solemnly turned the page and showed Rina a sketch of a staser rifle.<br><br>&quot;Staser rifle, mark seven,&quot; said the Guardsman in a reverent tone. &quot;The Time Lords&#39; answer to the Dalek gunstick. Single, three-round burst, and automatic fire modes. Integrated flashlight, foregrip, and compatibility with a standard-issue Gallifreyan army helmet HUD. Near-infinite power source tucked inside-- but that&#39;s classified information. Lethal to all forms of organic matter and capable of punching though a centimetre thick Dalekanium panel. Also features a stun function if you need less-than-lethal rounds. Rugged, accurate, and powerful. Truly the pinnacle of weapons technology.&quot; The Guardsman sighed to himself. &quot;Unfortunately, these things are <i>rare</i> in the PPC. As far as I know, the only way you can get your hands on one is picking one up from a Time War badfic or acquiring one from the DIA armoury-- but you need to be a patrol or SR officer to do so.&quot;<br><br>He turned the page. &quot;Staser machine pistol, mark four. While not as powerful as the full-blown rifle-- it can&#39;t penetrate Dalekanium-- it&#39;s an effective anti-organic weapon with an automatic fire option. We call it &#39;the unsewing machine&#39;. It relies on battery packs for power so make sure you have a couple of &#39;em on hand if things get dicey. This thing also has a stun function. Once again, very difficult to find here but much less so than the rifle. Big Murphy sells some for an insane amount of cash.&quot;<br><br>Flip. &quot;Staser pistol, mark two. This is the one that was issued at the start of the Time War-- I think this is what Antrilovorasilendar carries. Double action only, battery pack powered, stun or lethal settings. Nothing to write home about but this thing is widely available in the PPC. If I were you, I&#39;d get one of these.&quot;</p>

            <p>&quot;Gotcha.&quot; She looked longingly at the picture of the staser rifle, mark seven, making a mental note to keep an eye out for one anyway. That sounded pretty sweet.

            <p>The Guardsman picked at a chicken wing. &quot;Naya, Terabyte, and I were called on four times today. The first three were pushovers but the fourth one was a real piece of work. She was this ninja-Suvian that had somehow gotten herself into the Courtyard and was trying to tame Agent Alice for use as a noble steed in her one-woman overthrow of the PPC. When we get there, the Courtyard&#39;s stable is really, <i>really</i> quiet. TB picks up one non-equine life for hiding in there so we move in really carefully, yeah? As soon as we clear the door,&quot; the Guardsman mimed something falling on him, &quot;she jumped on my head, tried to slit my throat on the way down but missed, and rolled out of the way. So she then she pulls out these throwing stars out of her ninja outfit and manages to hit Naya with all four of &#39;em but they bounce off her suit&#39;s shields. Naya pulls out her Carnifex, takes a few shots at her but she leaps high into the air and then lands on TB.&quot; <br><br>The Guardsman made a ripping motion with his hands. &quot;Ninja-Sue freaking <i>pulls TB&#39;s spinal cables out</i> and then looks at us. Now, we&#39;re crapping out pants now because Ninja-Sue just ripped the strongest, most reinforced cable in TB&#39;s platform with her bare hands. So we rush her-- if she crushes Terabyte&#39;s hard drives it&#39;s game over-- and she pulls out a short sword and goes for the mêlée kill on us. She opens with a stab on me, I knock it out of the way with my rifle, and Naya goes for the Omni-tool stab but misses. And then she did this,&quot; he twisted his arm, &quot;and grabs Nana&#39;s arm and breaks it. I can&#39;t even describe it; that move shouldn&#39;t even be possible but... Suvians, amirite? So she then turns to me and dashes over before I can even shoulder my rifle. She picks me up with one hand-- <i>one hand</i> mind you-- and throws me out of one of the stable&#39;s windows. I land outside and by some miracle I&#39;m still holding my mark seven. I push myself off the ground and run to the window. I peek inside and Ninja-Sue has Naya pinned to the ground and is just going ham on her, like, bare-fisted.&quot; The Guardsman mimed raising a rifle and firing a shot. &quot;Boom. Just like at the range.&quot; <br><br>The Guardsman reclined in his chair. &quot;So that&#39;s one dead Sue, Alice inconvenienced but OK, TB&#39;s body out of commission <i>again</i>-- thank the gods its hard drives were still intact-- Naya in Medical with a broken everything, and I was defenestrated.&quot; He grinned. &quot;Defenestrated. I always wanted to use that word! So yeah, that&#39;s my day at work. How about you?&quot;<br></p>

            <p>&quot;Wow, and here I thought field agents had it rough,&quot; she said, shaking her head. &quot;There go any future plans of joining the DIA after the DMS gets too rough. At least in the fics, you can anticipate when&#39;s a good time to attack.&quot;<br><br>She readjusted her goggles. &quot;Anyway, not much has really happened since getting back from R-Rose Potter—&quot; She stumbled a bit over the name. &quot;—other than getting sent into two <i>Doctor Who</i> missions one right after the other. I swear, the Sues were all but identical. Both claimed to be the Doctor&#39;s daughter, both were carrying laser spanners, both swere supposedly two hundred years old, both claimed the surname Smith, both started in &quot;The Empty Child&quot;, and both tried to suck Captain Harkness into Twu Wuv. Only difference was that one had an ice gun and the other suggested throwing Rose out the airlock. At least they went down fairly easily, but lemme tell you, the first time, my partner was more nervous than a turkey on Thanksgiving. Thought the Sue would explode on him, though to be fair, I did kind of destroy the Gryffindor sixth year girls&#39; dorm, so... yeah.&quot; She grinned. &quot;Pretty easy stuff considering what we got back from yesterday.&quot;</p>

            <p>&quot;Seriously. Laser spanners are rare but useful-- and that ice gun sounds totally sweet. And what are the odds, eh? Two near-identical Suvians, two near-identical plots... All of this happening right after your debacle, hm? The Flowers aren&#39;t making this easier for you, right? You poor, unlucky sonnova gun.&quot; He drummed his fingers on the table. Surely there had to be some other way he could help this girl other than just being available for a talk. She-- and her partner by extension-- were probably in a bad place physically and emotionally right now. What could he possibly do to help? An idea came to him. He clapped his hands together and grinned.<br><br>&quot;You know,&quot; he said, &quot;speaking of tech... did you keep the laser spanner? If you&#39;re thinking of using it as a mêlée weapon, it&#39;s rubbish. Don&#39;t do that. What you need is a proper Gallifreyan weapon...&quot; He leaned towards the junior Time Lady. &quot;Agent Dives, may I interest you in a mark four pistol instead? I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll find it very useful against the Suvians Upstairs seems to throw at you. It might take me a few days to scrounge up the cash but I have a DIA discount at Big Murphy&#39;s and some tech to trade in.

            <p>&quot;I did manage to nab one of the laser spanners and the ice gun, but I gave them to my brother.
