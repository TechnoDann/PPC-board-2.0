            <p>And allow me to echo EPL in saying that having the agents already be in the continuum is an interesting change of pace. So far, I have not spotted any errors except this one:<br><br>[&quot;]No World-One nation exists here. What about that is hard to understand?” She asked as the fight began.<br>That &quot;S&quot; in &quot;she asked&quot; needs to be lowercase. Even though the quote ends in a question mark, the next word is part of an attribution tag--it is not its own sentence--so the word must be lowercase.</p>

            <p>I like that it started with the agents already in the world. Though I would&#39;ve liked to get to know Riaa and Lana a bit, skipping the intro stuff makes the mission flow a little better IMO. <br><br>BTW, you get ALL the Awesome Points for having a Girl Genius agent. (Especially a Smoke Knight) :D That comic is amazing and anyone who hasn&#39;t already should <a href="http://www.girlgeniusonline.com">go read it.</a> It&#39;s about mad scientists!

            <p>Would it be ok to have a character who was the result of a programming oversight or bug become an agent? Like a Missingno., or that one creepy girl in Pokémon X and Y?

            <p>Since we don&#39;t want STT fixing the SPG to fail on other counts, and all...<br><br>PPC knowledge looks fine, though I wonder why Elliot and Thingy were so ready to offer Mare a place in their RC - wouldn&#39;t the Marquis have something to say about that?<br><br>Anyway, actual writing. What I did was to delete the profiles unread.

Elwhatsit suffers the most: she can be summed up entirely in the word &#39;haughty&#39;. Mare is close to being just &#39;excitable&#39;, except that she does her &#39;no you can&#39;t come in&#39; thing to El for some reason (why not &#39;eee! newbie!&#39;? That&#39;s what the story that far would suggest she&#39;d do), and snarks at her in the second story.<br><br>And then there&#39;s Coriander, who... is introduced as being eager but hiding it (by standing by the door), turns out to be socially awkward, then descends into snark to El despite showing no previous signs of it. I&#39;ve no idea who he&#39;s supposed to be.<br><br>Then there&#39;s my other comments: adjectives and adverbs.

            <p>Now I’m wondering whether this supports or invalidates your opinion that profiles should not be required for the permission process.<br><br>Outlining character sheets and then writing the story matching the characters to their profile is certainly a good way to keep them in character. But I’m quite sure that it’s not the way I would do it; and I have seen others saying that they don’t know who their characters are until they have written their story.<br><br>But then, being able to build a profile based on what is shown in the prompts – and presumably in other writing exercises and background material that is not contained in the permission request, but may be made canon later – is an analytical skill valuable in PPCing, so the PGs may want to see the profiles regardless of whether they were written first or last.<br><br>Anyway, I learned here that sketching character profiles based on what I see in the story, to check how consistent they are, should be an important part of beta reading.<br><br>BTW, I would assume that Mare was sorted into Slytherin in her badfic of origin, because the Suethor wanted her to be in this house, not necessarily because she fits best there. Her Slytherin tie is only shown in the flashback. This may be a stealthy way to imply that realizing that she doesn’t actually identify with Slytherin is part of her character development. But this doesn’t exactly match the profile saying that she treats the inter-house rivalry seriously. (Is this meant to describe the situation when she joins the PPC? Is it still valid three years later, when Eldritch joins the team and Mare may have realized that she had been sorted into the wrong house?)<br><br>Anyway, if we plan a character arc with surprising twists that will explain the initially apparent inconsistencies in a character, should we spoil it in the permission request?<br><br>HG</p>

            <p><i>...being able to build a profile based on what is shown in the prompts... is an analytical skill valuable in PPCing...</i><br><br>I agree that it&#39;s a valuable skill - but I don&#39;t think the character profile should be the way to showcase it. Actually, the best thing would probably be to write an Intelligence report on the badfic you want to take on - that&#39;s the type of analysis we need to be able to do as PPC writers, not writing character profiles.<br><br>I had long arguments over how much should be in the profiles, and - obviously! - I still think we&#39;re getting way too much in there. You ask <i>if we plan a character arc with surprising twists... should we spoil it in the permission request?</i>; the answer should be an emphatic &#39;no!&#39;. But character profiles are the sort of writing which might end up requiring it.<br><br>For an example of what I think a profile <i>should</i> be like, you can check the Wiki article on Permission; I wrote both the example bios in there. I prefer the version with headings, but both contain the same information. For Lou, then, I provided:<br><br>-Basic physical information. This took about twenty words. Do you need to know where Lou buys her glasses, whether she has any birthmarks, and the history behind her feelings about her hair colour, to decide whether she&#39;s a valid character? No. {Well, since you asked-} I didn&#39;t. {Shurrup. There&#39;s an Eye Speye opticians in New Cal, I usually have a small one on my left sole, and I went through a phase of dyeing it black because it was &#39;more interesting&#39;.} Great. Anyway, this is just there to catch the &#39;demon from the dawn of time&#39; species entries.<br><br>-Powers and skills. This is an important section, because people have a terrible habit of giving their agents big magic, big weapons, and big problems. So we need to know what you&#39;ve slapped on there, because it might not make it into the samples. As with Lou, though, hiding the details is fine! This doesn&#39;t have to be an in-universe document; it&#39;s just something for us to look over quickly and say &#39;yep, fine&#39;. {Does &#39;talks to the author&#39; count as Big Magic or Big Problems?} Shut up.<br><br>-Personality. This could probably go - we can see it well enough from the story - but people argued vehemently for its inclusion. Again, it&#39;s there to catch bad stuff like &#39;and likes to torture any minis he finds&#39;. {Did someone really say that?} Yes, and no, they didn&#39;t get Permission. {Good. Ugh.}<br><br>-History. Once again, this just a simple filter. If your character deduced the existence of the PPC, created her own portal generator, and bullied the SO into giving her a job, we need to know. {Did <i>that</i> actually happen?} Not as far as I remember. But apart from that... well, look how little Lou&#39;s profile has.<br><br>Getting Permission is <b>not</b> meant to be a struggle against all odds. We&#39;ve tried over and over to streamline the process and make it easier, but it&#39;s never worked.<br><br>&#39;We should ask for a single story.&#39; &quot;But what if they write about something that doesn&#39;t tell us much?&quot; &#39;Well, we should specify what to write about.&#39; &quot;But a specific subject might not fit their characters.&quot; &#39;Then we could make it a randomised choice.&#39; &quot;But we should see something procedural as well, as a baseline.&quot; &#39;Then we can ask for two prompts.&#39; &quot;But there&#39;s a <i>hole</i> in my bucket, dear Liza, dear Liza...&quot;<br><br>Permission was a lot easier when everyone in the PPC wrote fanfic, and for the same couple of fandoms too. Then it was, &quot;Yep, I&#39;ve read some of your stuff, I trust you; you&#39;re in.&quot; Now... now I don&#39;t even know.<br><br>If you were trying to control the quality of a shared universe that isn&#39;t hosted at a single location, how would <i>you</i> do it?<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Might I suggest some sort of open beta? Basically, you come and introduce yourself, hang out for a month, etc., then you write a mission and post it (entering PPC canon on a probational basis). Then the whole community can take a look, provide suggestions, and generally whip it into shape. If that doesn&#39;t happen, it gets kicked from canon and the author gets invited to take it down and rewrite.<br>After a few missions go up without significant issues, you lose the probation and get full freedom to write. Basically, we as a community help people get better at writing through the medium of missions; and if they refuse to improve, their missions aren&#39;t part of our shared universe.<br>And if we get too many Sue Agents floating around, unremoved, the Flowers could resurrect the DIO, or normal Agents could write ‛‛missions&#39;&#39; in HQ.<br>Of course, there could also be a preliminary check of Agent bios to pre-empt bad characters.<br>The downside is that some people might read the rejected missions and associate us with bad writing. Or we might gain a reputation for helping budding writers along, rather than trashing their work? Who knows?</p>

            <p>Personally, as a beta-reader, I&#39;m fond of seeing character profiles both in Permission and on the Wiki.  It&#39;s useful for me to be able to get a quick run-down of what the character is supposed to be like, so I can judge whether or not the appropriate characterization is shining through.

            <p><i>... The girl turned to see the blue-eyed blonde woman that was her psychiatrist. <br><br>“So, Solvig, what have you learned today?” she said.</i><br>I became a bit confused here. Yes, the psychiatrist is the last female character mentioned, and there is a paragraph break. But to me it still looked like ‘supergirl’ is speaking and Solvig is the psychiatrist’s name. I had to think about it before I realized what’s going on.<br><br><i>She shrugged and put the feather back in the bag, then <b>takes</b> out a piece of paper.</i><br>Tense shift.<br><br><i>After a while of walking, she arrived at a Response Center door, compared the numbers and sighed <b>when realized that wasn’t</b> the same, then double checked.</i><br>Missing words?<br><br><i>Your angel partner acted like a total pervert, and then some DIA guy tried to <b>beat up him</b> ...</i><br>Shouldn’t this be &quot;beat him up&quot;? Or is this just how Solvig speaks?<br><br><i>Yuuna smacked her <b>in back</b> of the head.</i><br>Missing word?<br><br><i>... the agents soon found themselves <b>in in</b> the Parr’s living room ...</i><br>Paging the Repetitive Department of Repetition.<br><br><i>Dash smiled <b>back her</b>.</i><br>Missing word?<br><br><i>... <b>something’s</b> may show up there.</i> <br>Is this meant to be plural?<br><br><i>... where they barely could see their hands in <b>front their face</b>.</i><br>Missing word? And I think &quot;their faces&quot; should be plural.<br><br><i>Once <b>the the</b> alarm was triggered ...</i><br>Repetitively paging the Repetitive Department of Repetition.<br><br><i>When they <b>have</b> finally arrived to the shore, Solvig turned to them ...</i><br>Tense shift. Also, I’m not sure whether that should be &quot;arrived at the shore&quot;.<br><br><i>Something tells me that relationship <b>may just a</b> teeny bit strained ...</i><br>Missing word? Or is this how Feratu speaks?<br><br><i>Luckily, her impact-resistant frame gave her enough time to recover and scramble out of the way before the rocks fell on top of <b>him</b>.</i><br>Shouldn’t this be &quot;her&quot;?<br><br><i>Batboy set off another smoke <b>bomb tried</b> then to escape in another direction ...</i><br>Missing word(s) and/or punctuation? (There goes my promise.)<br><br><i>... Meta-Man released the <b>structure his</b> grip ...</i><br>Missing word?<br><br><i>Solvig walked to her, covered in a blanket she <b>took</b> out from her bag.</i><br>I assume that Solvig &quot;had taken&quot; (past perfect) the blanket out from her bag before she was covered in it.<br><br><i>When she read it, her eyes opened wide, <b>and said</b>, “What? ...</i><br>Her eyes said that? (Missing word?)<br><br><i>Also, I like the idea of giving Batman a sibling or other family; <b>lot</b> of opportunity for drama and character development there.</i><br>I think that should be either &quot;lots&quot; or &quot;a lot&quot;, but I may be wrong.<br><br><i>... as <b>long it</b> makes sense within that universe.</i><br>Missing word?<br><br>Huh, that was long, and I probably didn’t get half of the references. But I enjoyed it anyway. And I liked #TheDress.<br><br>HG</p>

            <p>1.- Clarified.<br><br>2.- Fixed.<br><br>3.- Added both missing words in that sentence.

Fixed.<br><br>5.- Added missing word.<br><br>6.- Fixed<br><br>7.- Added missing word.<br><br>8.- No, it wasn&#39;t supposed to be a plural, in fact, I have no idea how it got there. Fixed.<br><br>9.- Added missing word and &#39;face&#39; got pluralized (is this even a word?).<br><br>10.- Fixed.<br><br>11.- Fixed the tense shift. I don&#39;t know either, but I&#39;m playing safe and changing it for &#39;at&#39;.<br><br>12.- Added missing word.<br><br>13.- I&#39;m not sure either, maybe SkarmorySlver could clarify it.<br><br>14.- It&#39;s actually missing punctuation and misplaced word. Fixed both.<br><br>15.- Yup, you have assumed correctly. Fixed.<br><br>16.- Added the missing word. Though, it would have worked metaphorically, that wasn&#39;t the intention.<br><br>17.- Mmm... weird, I had written &#39;lots&#39; originally. Someone must&#39;ve changed it and I didn&#39;t notice. Returned it to the original.<br><br>18.- Uh... I find nothing missing in this one. As long it makes sense, I think I will leave it like that.<br><br>Thanks again for your concrit, and glad you enjoyed the mission! :D</p>

            <p>I don&#39;t know if any of you have ever run into this, but way back in 2010 a certain &#39;Dân o Nandor on Anduin&#39; started a list of all 1200 named characters in Middle-earth, in reverse order of their prominence in the Legendarium. The list was rolled out on several websites (<a href="http://newboards.theonering.net/forum/gforum/perl/gforum.cgi">TheOneRing.net</a> and <a href="http://thehalloffire.net/forum/viewforum.php?f=5">The Hall of Fire</a> are the ones I know of); it stalled out somewhere in the middle for a couple of years; but at long last, it is <b>finished</b>.<br><br><a href="http://thehalloffire.net/forum/viewtopic.php?f=5&amp;t=2904">Right here</a>, you can read about all 1205 characters in the Legendarium, objectively ordered by how often they&#39;ve been written about (plus a few other factors; <a href="http://thehalloffire.net/forum/viewtopic.php?f=5&amp;t=2721">see here</a> for a brief description of how the ranking is determined).<br><br>My favourite character chimes in at #1179, of course. ^_^<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>So, I&#39;ve been working on my agent, Carnage, recently, and I thought of something: what&#39;s his partner going to be like? I was thinking of something along the lines of a more &#39;modern&#39; monster to represent the monsters of modern times, while Carnage, as a dragon, represents cultural monsters from ancient times. So far, I&#39;m thinking of either a sapient necromorph slasher or a xenomorph. Does anyone have any ideas for what his partner could be?</p>

            <p>OK, I&#39;ve decided to go with a Thin Man for Carnage&#39;s partner-As a side note, thank you to everybody who commented with advice! Besides filling my standards, for lack of a better term, a Thing Man would actually be a good choice for another reason: through my experiences in Enemy Unknown, Thin Men seem to remain completely cool and collected at all times-an ideal counter for Carnage, who&#39;s more outgoing and impulsive.<br><br>In terms of details, though, I&#39;m a bit lacking. He&#39;s definitely going to have a distorted voice, as if he&#39;s speaking through a garbled radio, and I&#39;m thinking that a emotionless personality would suit him, especially considering why I picked his species. In terms of a name and fandoms, though, I&#39;m stumped: maybe something starting with S for his name...<br><br>Also, to answer SkarmorySilver with the idea for a Yautja, there is an AVP/MLP crossover I&#39;ve had my eye on with a Yautja character that I could recruit... &gt;:]</p>

            <p>It&#39;s one thing to get advice on your characters, it&#39;s another thing to crowdsource their creation, which is what you&#39;re veering into.  Part of writing for the PPC is coming up with your own ideas, not just using ones other people come up with.  If you&#39;re interested in brainstorming with someone, I&#39;d suggest doing it privately.</p>

            <p>First off, I must confess to being a bit concerned about the way you&#39;re going about creating characters. This seems more like an exercise in wanting to make agents &quot;cool&quot; and powerful rather than interesting and compelling. Characterization is the most important aspect of creating a character. True, what an agent is can and does inform characterization to some extent, but I would argue that still takes a secondary place.<br><br>There is also the issue that many monsters are, well, monstrous. Dragons have the advantage of being shown as intelligent and cunning creatures in many of their portrayals. Most other monsters, however, are single-minded tools of destruction meant to invoke the fear of death in the audience. There are certainly ways to justify having an intelligent version of an otherwise mindless monster in the PPC, but those loopholes can be easily abused.<br><br>If you are committed to this idea of classic and modern monsters, however, then I guess I have some suggestions. As Iximaz previously said, I would stay away from necromorphs and xenomorphs. They&#39;re both too simple, too destructive. I wouldn&#39;t go with <i>XCOM</i> chryssalids for similar reasons. <br><br><i>XCOM</i> Thin Men might be a good choice. They combine a modern fear of the unknown (what with being from space and all) alongside fears about inhumanity and security, as they were meant for infiltration. Thin Men look not-quite human; an aspect that can be played up as an allusion to the uncanny valley.<br><br>Some sort of cyborg or humanoid robot could also work well in this fashion. The rush of progress and the possibility of transhumanism can be terrifying things. How much of the original person is lost beyond their mechanized parts? The robot, on the other hand, once again plays into the idea of being not-quite human combined with the idea of uncontrollable technology. Think of all the media that uses out-of-control AI.<br><br>All that being said, though, I&#39;d refer you back to my original point. Characters should be based around who they are, not what they are.</p>

            <p>I&#39;ll have to second Iximaz, in that agent ideas are often things you come up with yourself - either you snatch them from your original writing, your fanfics, badfics you spork on missions, or just spitball a concept out of your rear end and see if it works. I&#39;ll also agree that xenomorphs don&#39;t work very well as agents, since their entire life cycle is destructive to people and they&#39;re infamously bloodthirsty.<br><br>Now, to answer your question, if you want a modern alien-type monster for Carnage&#39;s partner who may be able to work as an agent, a very good suggestion in my opinion would be a member of the rival species to the xenomorphs, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predator_(alien)">Yautja</a>. They&#39;re characterized by their hunting of other dangerous species for sport and honor - so Sue-slaying wouldn&#39;t be too much of a stretch for one. Though there&#39;s the problem of the Predators intentionally hunting humans as well, which would make for a pretty interesting conundrum given that most PPC agents are human. Thus, a Predator agent may have to learn restraint very quickly to abide by PPC protocol, which would make an interesting moral conflict and (hopefully) a good story arc.<br><br>Also, according to The Other Wiki, the Yautja did have a somewhat tentative truce with humanity back when they were viewed as gods, until the Xenomorphs got out of control. So I guess a Yautja agent could in theory learn in due course to avoid treating human agents as game, and stick to hunting Sues instead. The latter of which is of course a lot more fun. ;P</p>

Monsters represent the unknown, and Carnage represents the old forms of magic while a cryptid or alien represents modern weird science - especially if you give this agent a kind of &quot;Raygun Gothic&quot; feel to its aesthetic. It&#39;d also be interesting to have World One aliens running around the place. =]</p>

            <p>Chryssalids are nearly-mindless beasts. All they do is kill and reproduce. While that certainly makes them an intimidating foe in a video game, I wouldn&#39;t exactly call them overly frightening. Then again, maybe I&#39;ve just played too much <i>XCOM</i> to really be spooked by them any more. <br><br>Even if this happens to be an intelligent fic-spawned chryssalid that can be reasoned with, there&#39;s the issue of expansion. What happens when this agent kills a Sue or Stu and plants a new chryssalid in the fresh corpse? Suddenly there&#39;s an infestation in the PPC — or worse, in the Word World.</p>

            <p>They don&#39;t have to. An intelligent <s>arsehole crab Chryssalid doesn&#39;t have to use their ovipositor during the kill - and for that matter, may not even want to. It&#39;s shown in the kill animations in <i>XCOM: EU/W</i> that the killing is actually done with the long stabby claw bits, while the implantation of the Chryssalid egg happens with a kind of ovipositor arrangement.<br><br>Additionally, there ain&#39;t much in the way of <i>XCOM</i> badfic around, so our hypothetical Chryssalagent is going to be in disguise for the overwhelming majority of their missions. I personally like the image of a cultured Chryssalid who, for lack of a better term, went native; one that now reads Baudelaire and attends the ballet and so forth. It amuses me, and I think that while you could certainly run that joke into the ground, it&#39;d make for an interesting Jekyll-and-Hyde dynamic within the character - the agent struggling against his more primal, warlike urges, the battle made all the more difficult by the fact that his being no more than an Ethereal bioweapon is canonical.<br><br>There&#39;s potential in that, I think. =]</s></p>

            <p>Because simply calling them &quot;Grey Alien or MiB Expies&quot; doesn&#39;t really cut it. Last time I checked, for instance, the Men in Black were on humanity&#39;s side and did not vomit caustic substances over frankly unfair distances. Besides, when it comes to Sectoids, which d&#39;you want? Your boggo basic Sectoid? The big red Sectoid Commander? Perhaps Aquatoids from TFTD, or Aereons from <i>Interceptor</i>, or Psilords from Afterblanks? Perhaps one of the Zudj-enslaved ones from <i>The Bureau: XCOM Declassified</i> - okay, maybe not them, but you get my point.<br><br>See, XCOM&#39;s a really old franchise, with the first iteration being a MicroProse game from <i>1993</i>. There&#39;s lots of stuff to choose from, but I&#39;d still recommend going for something a little more monstrous than the basic Sectoid. Your man here wants a monster, and if you go through the annals of cryptids and aliens and creepypasta, then you&#39;ve got some interesting options. =]</p>

            <p>CIDR notation is a syntax for specifying IP addresses and their associated routing prefix. It appends a slash character to the address and the decimal number of leading bits of the routing prefix, e.g., 192.168.2.0/24 for IPv4, and 2001:db8::/32 for IPv6.<br><br>Basically, you should so a WHOIS on the IPv6 address and try blocking what it recommends to see if it helps.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m not a network expert either, Wikia Stars just have to perform range blocks occasionally. ;)<br><br>IPv6 addresses are each 128 bits long. Because each digit in an IPv6 address can have 16 different values (from 0 to 15), each digit represents the overall value of 4 bits (one nibble), with 32 digits total. As with IPv4, CIDR notation describes ranges in terms of a common prefix of bits. For example 2001:db8::/32 means that the range described has the first 32 bits set to the binary digits 00100000000000010000110110101000.</p>

            <p>It may have been my fault. ^_^<br><br>I see that your Chrome install is giving an IPv6 address - one which starts with the same four digits as Ammo Guy&#39;s address. Until today, to block Ammo Guy, I had to enter just those four digits - IPv6 blocking wasn&#39;t really supported. I checked it against Tomash&#39;s IP, but didn&#39;t know you had a v6 address.<br><br>But now Sean has enabled it, and I changed the block to more of Ammo Guy&#39;s address - and you can post. So yeah, my fault.<br><br>(To test whether Ammo Guy is blocked - can you try posting from Chrome to the Other Board?

            <p>So, a certain project occupies my mind for a while now... I want to create a well-researched, balanced and entertaining goodfic about the Next Generation (ya know, nineteen years later...) with the main focus being James Potter II and his Hogwarts career. A tribute of sort to the magnificent series which got me into reading books in first place.<br><br>Here&#39;s where <b>you</b> come in, brothers and sisters. I consider myself pretty good when in comes to Potter knowledge but, naturally, there are things I am bound to overlook or miss. The question I have is: Is anyone willing to be my occasional source of knowledge-slash-opinion about plot, characters, etc. I realize most of the things discussed would be fanon/headcanon, speculations and theories, but I believe it is possible to do it. I will be keeping as much canon as possible: we&#39;re talking dates, locations, events, characters - EVERYTHING!<br><br>If anyone&#39;s willing (and Ixi, I&#39;m not asking you because, although you are probably the biggest Potter nerd here *cough*afterme*cough*, you are a busy woman and we&#39;re all waiting for LMM to hit us!) to share their knowledge, feel free to compose a mail - my adress is mattcipher94 and the gmail tag.<br><br>Although, I will leave you with something to discuss: wizard schools. <br><br>I remember posting my theory before but now, since I&#39;m going to actually find a use for it, I&#39;ll do it again.<br><br>From Her Majesty Rowling, we know there are 11 official schools educating witches and wizards of the world. Not Europe but the entire planet. So, with most of them already known, here is my list of them and the regions they operate in (note: light grey colour indicates unconfrimed locations, and my own speculations)<br><br><img src="http://oi60.tinypic.com/vio080.jpg"><br><br>I would really welcome your opinions on that matter. This project is the first big writing thing I&#39;m trying and I promise to find a way of compensation for all the effort put in its production! :)</p>

            <p>Personally, I wonder which schools accept nonhuman students? I mean, in my personal headcanon, Magical Britain&#39;s isolationist views make it seem very backwards to the rest of the wizarding world, and that magical-being-views are much more progressive in, say, Beauxbatons (which might be why they accept veela-descent students, for example!) than in Hogwarts.</p>

            <p>Do we count veelas like Fleur, vampires, werewolves, goblins... should they be fully sentient, or not? Also, I really don&#39;t think elves and dwarves exist in this universe.

So far we know veelas, giants and goblins are able to... mate, for the lack of better word, with humans. We have people like the Delacours, Hagrid or professor Flitwick, as proof. For example, I can&#39;t imagine there being half-centaurs, or satyrs, or half-mermen without some particulary nasty images coming to my mind.</p>

            <p>It was initially revealed on JKR’s playful old website, which sadly doesn’t exist anymore because she’s a serious mystery writer now. JKR responded to fans speculating about Flitwick’s ancestry after seeing him in the movie. She said that the fans believing that Flitwick must have some goblin blood got it right, and that she was surprised that the film makers got it right just from the description in the books, because she hadn’t told anybody that this was the back story she had in mind for him.<br><br>HG </p>

            <p>That design is clearly based on stereotypical images of black people, with a genie motif thrown in for some reason. It might not be intentionally racist, in the same way some old people can be, but that doesn&#39;t make it acceptable.</p>

            <p>The <a href="http://dragonball.wikia.com/wiki/Mr._Popo#Trivia">Dragonball Wiki</a> mentions it in their trivia section.

It effectively turns every attack into Gyro Ball, allowing you to deal extra damage (scaling up to a 2x multiplier) if you move slower than your opponent. It might not be great on a Mamoswine, but running a very bulky set with no IVs in Speed and a Brave nature can work very well, especially against other physical attackers. Mamoswine always excelled as a wallbreaker, and now it gets the chance to pour on the hurt against common OU threats like Keldeo and Metagross who otherwise OHKO it.<br><br>...<br><br>That was a lot more involved than I thought it would be. Hopefully I won&#39;t random <i>Ascendant</i>&#39;s wiki any time soon. =]</p>

            <p>I liked the agents&#39; interactions, and the different ways the non-humans reacted to being in a human disguise in a strange, magical world.<br><br>But as so often, I have some nitpicks:<br><br><i>He <b>tuned</b> his back to her and started limping away.</i><br>You probably meant &quot;turned&quot;.<br><br><i>I do not <b>want want</b> to share a House with a Sue.</i><br>Repetition.<br><br><i>Once the agents finally reached <b>the the</b> seventh floor of Hogwarts, Chakkik looked askance at Natalie.</i><br>Repetition.<br><br><i>Za’kiir and Stephanie had changed out of the DORKS back into their natural forms, and had slept quite comfortably, as had Natalie herself.</i><br>Huh? The DORKS isn’t a disguise, it’s a device that creates a disguise. I don’t believe that you can change out of it. Yes, the agents wouldn&#39;t be able to change their disguise or to drop the disguise and change back to their natural form on mission if they didn&#39;t use a DORKS. But calling this &quot;to change out of the DORKS&quot; doesn’t sound right.<br><br>&quot;<i>That is not Voldemort. …</i>&quot;<br>Apparently Natalie&#39;s rant was not enough to prepare me for  &quot;Voldemort&quot; going down so easily.  For the rest of the page I wondered why Voldemort didn&#39;t do anything. Not sure whether this is me being thick. It may have worked for others.<br><br><i>Second, I absolutely refuse to recite that line from Clash of the Titans in regards to you, Podd.</i> <br>Where did this come from? I understand that it is a setup for releasing the kraken further down the page. But why would Chakkik say this at this time? The only reason I can imagine is stealthily hinting at Stephanie that she should prepare for having her disguise dropped, in a way the Sue and her grandfather would presumably not understand. This, or some other reason I don&#39;t see, might have been made more clear. <br><br>Besides that, it&#39;s a really good co-write.<br><br>HG</p>

            <p>I thought that, to restore canon, Sues have to be killed by something (which seems to be) canonical.  That&#39;s one reason why disguises totally transform the body instead of just covering it in an illusion.<br><br>But you had one character killed by an undisguised Khajiit, and the other by a Mantis Ant&#39;s acidic venom.  Aren&#39;t creatures like that turning up in the Potterverse and killing people going to damage canon at least as much as the original badfic?<br><br>But apart from that, I enjoyed the mission.  It was a lot of fun and there was a good dynamic with the agents.<br></p>

            <p>Jay and Acacia usually killed Sues using canonical weapons and disguised as something that would canonically want to kill all <s>ten</s> nine walkers of <i>The Fellowship of the Ring</i> or whatever the Sue was in her badfic. I still like this classical method best. It doesn&#39;t require much clean-up. Just get rid of the corpse. The canon characters&#39; memories of the Sue will fade and they will snap back into character, and non-canonical objects and locations will just vanish. No neuralyzing or burning down is required.<br><br>But this is not always practical. Who would canonically want to murder fifth year students, or Slytherins, or Americans, or whatever category you could fit the Sue in? Even Generic Death Eaters wouldn&#39;t just randomly kill people.<br><br>Acromantula might work in the Forbidden Forest. But since they apparently never leave their hide-out, an Acromantula killing the Sue at Malfoy Manor would still be stressing the canon.<br><br>Insane serial killers is probably the best option to go with – but how would an insane serial killer disguise look like?<br><br>After a non-canonical assassination, thorough clean-up is necessary. Neuralyzing all witnesses is absolutely essential. (Apparently there were no witnesses in this case.) Even than the canon may still be so stressed that the word-world cannot just snap back. You may need to neuralyze everybody who met the Sue and may still remember her. You may need to remove non-canonical objects brought in or created by the Sue, and you may need to burn down non-canonical locations. (And you may still get into trouble with the Flowers That Be, if this fits the story arc your author planned for you.)<br><br>At least that&#39;s what I got from previous discussions.<br><br>HG</p>

            <p>You&#39;ve got a good point there.  There aren&#39;t many things willing and able to kill random kids.  Although I would&#39;ve thought there was a difference between something that was <b>unlikely</b> to kill someone, and something that physically couldn&#39;t because it just plain doesn&#39;t exist in that world.<br><br>On the bright side, here&#39;s a ficlet:<br><blockquote>&quot;Y-y-you want <b>what</b>?&quot; Makes-Things backed even further away from the agent.  &quot;No.  No!  That&#39;s just... You&#39;re even c-crazier than the other assassins.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Possibly,&quot; admitted Sean, not wanting to dwell on his past.  &quot;But you&#39;ve gotta admit, it makes sense.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Sense?  How can that possibly m-make sense?&quot;  Eyes darting left and right as he searched the DoSAT lab for a refuge, the terrified technician desperately tried to keep the madman talking.<br><br>&quot;Simple.  A lot of missions take place in the twentieth  or twenty-first centuries, where there aren&#39;t any Random Orcs to kill people, right?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yes, I know that.&quot; By now, Makes-Things had squeezed into the gap between two cabinets and was pulling his labcoat over his head in imitation of Elliot Dunkel&#39;s coat of solitude.<br><br>Sean started to lean round to get a better view of the man he was trying to talk to, but then decided against it.  He took a deep breath and continued as if nothing was happening.  &quot;Terrorists are obviously right out because they&#39;re in bad taste.  Insane serial killers would be good, but what would they look like?&quot;<br><br>Some mumbled words came from the hidden figure, but Sean could only make out the phrases &quot;Have you,&quot; and &quot;mirror lately?&quot;<br><br>Ignoring him, Sean said, &quot;So that only leaves one thing that could randomly kill people.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yes, but y-you can&#39;t expect me to program <b>that </b>into the disguise generators.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Why not?  They can already turn people into different species, so why not a virus?  And there are lots of different types to choose from, so even if Ebola is too difficult, there&#39;s always SARS or Anthrax.&quot;<br><br>&quot;But a single virus cell isn&#39;t enough to k-kill anyone.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yeah, obviously you&#39;d have to turn us into a colony of the things.  And most agents are multi-celled organisms anyway, so that should make it easier for you.&quot;  By now Sean was enthusiastically gesturing with his hands as he explained his great idea.  &quot;And we&#39;d spend the mission breeding and incubating inside the Sue&#39;s body, so she would ever spot us.  It&#39;s the perf—&quot;<br><br>Sean suddenly felt a hand on his shoulder.  Slowly he turned and found himself looking at two ogres in FicPsyc uniforms.<br><br>&quot;Agent Bellman?&quot; asked the first ogre, the one with his had on Sean&#39;s shoulder.<br><br>Sean just nodded.<br><br>The other ogre called out, &quot;It&#39;s all right.  You can come out now.&quot;<br><br>Makes-Things emerged, straighten his coat.  He was holding a mobile phone in one hand.  &quot;You got my text then?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yeah.  We&#39;ll take of this now.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Come along Agent Bellman,&quot; said the first ogre.  &quot;Doc Freedenberg needs to remind you about the dangers of mixing too much Bleeprin with your prescription antidepressants.&quot;</blockquote></p>

            <p>So far, I&#39;m liking Jing Ke surpisingly well.  Eric Bloodaxe and Iskander are good, too, though they keep dying on me.  Shielder&#39;s alright; she&#39;s a bit generic, though it is cute the way she calls you Senpai.  I&#39;m honestly surprised how much I like Kid!Iskander, actually.  I was annoyed that they changed his character design so much (and probably to make him more appealing to fangirls), but even as a kid, the King of Bros is just too charismatic to resist.<br><br>I really wish I could read Japanese, going off the images I think Cu keeps hitting on Shielder maybe?  There&#39;s a lot of him smirking and her blushing, at least. And the white-haired girl (Olga-Marie?) is angry a lot.  That&#39;s about as much of the story as I can follow.<br><br>I do wish both that there was more characterization for the other Servants and that I could actually understand it.  I find the idea of Waver being possessed by a Heroic Spirit to be very intriguing, but if he&#39;s just a random summon I don&#39;t think we&#39;ll actually get a story about it.<br><br>The one I really want is EMIYA, though.  There was a stage where I fought him, but I think I just have to cross my fingers and hope I summon him.  *sigh*  <strike>It&#39;s not like he&#39;s my LO or anything...</strike></p>

            <p>Honestly, I am NOT the person you want to ask about this.  I&#39;m just in it for the story (and all the pretty guys and ladies), not the more mechanical side of things.  All I can tell you is that her stat distribution means she&#39;d be hard to use in Fate/Extra, but that&#39;s not really relevant to anything.  Ahem.  That said, my response is going to be from a storytelling standpoint, not a mechanical one.<br><br>Two A-Rank Noble Phantasms seem overpowered a bit, but then again, most Servants are.  I really like the effect of the second one, though, I think it would make for a good, dramatic fight.  The high collateral damage means that her Master would have to be fairly cold in order to do it.  I can&#39;t imagine Kotomine hesitating to activate it... but even Kiritsugu might.  The first one ties in well with Own&#39;s poetry and I&#39;m going to sound incredibly uncultured saying this... but I think it might run into issues because of its thematic similarites when you consider both the plot of UBW and blackened Servants.  I know the poem comes well before, but in context, it feels like a bit of a knock-off.  On the other hand, if you spin the themes right, it could be very strong.  <br><br>On a mechanical note, I do think the first one is probably too strong, because there&#39;s no time limit on the copies.  So a clever Master could basically clone all the other Servants.  In the interest of balance, I&#39;d either make the clones only last for a given period of time, or have their stats be ranked down a level from the original.  It would still be extremely powerful, but there&#39;d be some limits.  The other thing I would suggest is adding in some kind of drawback.  Maybe the copies represent a major mana drain for Owen, or maybe they&#39;re not necessarily loyal to her, either.<br><br>Also, I&#39;m not a huge fan of extraneous genderbends in the series itself.  I think it works for Saber, but not every historical figure needs to have actually been a cute girl.  More focus on actual historical women would be preferential, in my opinion.  That said, I can hardly fault you for following canon.<br><br>If you want someone to do a more in-detail analysis, I&#39;d suggest trying Beast&#39;s Lair.  They have a lot of members who have much more expertise on this kind of thing.  I&#39;m definitely more of a casual fan.</p>

            <p>I should have made it clear that the clone dies as soon as the original Servant dies, and that she can only have one up at a time. The lowered stats makes more thematic sense too, so I&#39;ll amend the design accordingly. Also, you hit on the idea that the clones aren&#39;t loyal to Winifred - the only thing they know to do is attack their target, and this pursuit is single-minded and not noticeably subtle. After all, to quote <i>Welcome To Night Vale</i>, &quot;They come in twos. You come in twos. You and you. <i>Kill your double</i>.&quot; I&#39;m also considering the idea that it&#39;s a major mana drain, but the biggest change is going to be that the range will be drastically lowered - thus making it more of a last-ditch thing.<br><br>As for the genderbends, there was - originally - a reason for that. I was going to do a non-genderbent Servant version of Jessie Pope, a civilian poet who wrote motivational poems to get people to join up for World War One, and the person to whom Owen&#39;s <i>Dulce Et Decorum Est</i> was dedicated. Her skill set was planned around mass buffs and damage bonuses to friendly soldiers, y&#39;know, support type skills.<br><br>Also she was gonna be the more villainously inclined of the two. Good powers =/= good people. =]</p>

            <p>It makes a little more sense knowing that, and definitely seems more balanced.  The idea of decreasing the range helps as well.  Honestly, I think the two combined could make for a very powerful combo - even if the original defeats the copy, fighting them will delay them long enough for them to take a lot of damage from the gas.  And I like the idea of two Servants who play off each other like that.<br><br>Now that I think about it, the whole clone idea does have the potential to get some really good reactions out of the canon characters.  Saber has her own traumatic experiences with murderous clone versions, and I think the whole thing would hit just close enough to home for Archer that it&#39;d seriously irritate him.</p>

            <p>While Jessie was going to be this Stepford Smiler kind of bright-and-shiny soldier-buffing figure, Winifred was always supposed to cut a very... grim figure. The key part of Strange Meeting is that the clone gets a small damage boost for each soldier the original has killed.

            <p>Honestly, I am NOT the person you want to ask about this.  I&#39;m just in it for the story (and all the pretty guys and ladies), not the more mechanical side of things.  All I can tell you is that her stat distribution means she&#39;d be hard to use in Fate/Extra, but that&#39;s not really relevant to anything.  Ahem.  That said, my response is going to be from a storytelling standpoint, not a mechanical one.<br><br>Two A-Rank Noble Phantasms seem overpowered a bit, but then again, most Servants are.  I really like the effect of the second one, though, I think it would make for a good, dramatic fight.

            <p>Here are your starters (being both technically-returnbies you get FEs guaranteed):<br>Who&#39;s Des&#39;s Pokémon?<br><img src="http://randompokemon.com/sprites/animated/565.gif"><br>Iiiiiiiit&#39;s Carracosta!<br><br>And Des&#39;s starting item is:-<br><img src="http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/dungeonsofdredmor/images/a/a5/Bolt_ampoule_poison.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/20?cb=20110728081901"><br>A Poison Ampoule Bolt from <i>Dungeons of Dredmor</i>!<br><br>Poison Ampoule Bolt is a pretty decent item for a sweeper like Carracosta. It functions in a similar way to King&#39;s Rock - moves that don&#39;t have a chance to Poison the enemy get a 10% chance to in addition to any other effects - which means you can spread it like nobody&#39;s business. Carracosta&#39;s access to both Solid Rock <i>and</i> Shell Smash means that it can do extremely well as a physical or even a mixed sweeper, and sometimes Poison can be just enough to finish the job. However, Poison Ampoule Bolt is outclassed by the Poison Bottle Bolt, which replaces not only replaces the effect with Bad Poisoning (cf. Toxic), but also has a 10% chance to Badly Poison adjacent enemy targets. Shame, really.<br><br>---<br><br>Who&#39;s Matt&#39;s Pokémon?<br><img src="http://randompokemon.com/sprites/animated/368.gif"><br>Iiiiiiit&#39;s Gorebyss!<br><br>And Matt&#39;s starting item is:<br><img src="http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/dungeonsofdredmor/images/5/5c/Polearm_acidspitter.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/20?cb=20130529174829"><br>An Acidspitter from <i>Dungeons of Dredmor</i>!<br><br>Okay, now THIS syngery works better. Gorebyss is a special Shell Smash sweeper who benefits hugely from rain. The Acidspitter gives every non-contact move a 20% chance to lower the target Pokemon&#39;s Special Defence by 1 stage. When something&#39;s switching in, that means it&#39;s much easier to keep your pink fish mon alive for longer. Why aren&#39;t you using one? Do it now!<br><br>---<br><br>And there we go. Apologies for the tiny item pictures.</p>

            <p>Here&#39;s your starter Pokémon:<br><img src="http://randompokemon.com/sprites/animated/219.gif"><br>Iiiiiiits Magcargo!<br><br>And your starting item is:<br><img src="http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/risk-of-rain/images/a/a1/Bustling_Fungus_Icon.png/revision/latest?cb=20140131055628"><br>Bustling Fungus from <i>Risk Of Rain</i>!<br><br>Now, Bustling Fungus is a really good item for status walls and mons like that - it heals you for 1/4 of your Health every time you use a non-damaging move. This also helps slow setup sweepers get a boost off before hurling themselves at the foe. Magcargo is very much the former, although it&#39;s not very good at being a wall. While its Defence stat is a very creditable 120, it only has an HP stat of 50 and its typing is not very good defensively. However, with a Bustling Fungus, you can recover from enemy damage while setting up Stealth Rock, spreading status with Toxic or Will-O-Wisp, boosting your already reasonable Defence with Acid Armour, and so on. Mandatory on every Bustling Fungus set, though, is Recover - which now heals a total of <i>75%</i> of your health - and that allows Magcargo to tank more and more. However, you might want to ditch AA (or Rocks if you have another hazards setter) for Lava Plume to spread more status and avoid Taunt shenanigans.<br><br>Also, quite by chance, it sort of looks like an orange Yoshi! If Yoshis were slugs, anyway. =]</p>

            <p>To all of you who have enrolled a fanwriter: thank you! I loved reading the personality snippets, and it&#39;s great to have ready-to-use characters. <br><br>I have an issue, though. My fanwriter is rather young (twelve) so she&#39;s pretty fixated on age, like most kids are. The thing is, I don&#39;t know the ages of your fanwriters. I can guess, but I can&#39;t be sure. If no one minds, I would like any who entered to post the age of their fanwriter. Of course, I know a lot of them are your fictionalized selves, so feel free to make up a new age if you&#39;re sensitive about that.<br><br>And if you didn&#39;t enter a fanwriter, but would like to do so now, feel free! I&#39;d like a brief snippet on the personality of your fanwriter alter-ego, if ya don&#39;t mind, with pertinent info such as your Disney LO and your favorite Prince, Princess, and Villain. Thanks! <br><br>-Miss <s>Tai&#39;shar</s> Alleb.</p>

            <p>Before anything else, thank you guys for the ages! They&#39;ll be extremely helpful. <br><br>Now, the topic line. At DOFA, the minis are mini-Brooms. However, since there are eleven Princess films, I&#39;d like to do something similar to Avatar: The Last Airbender. Each movie will have its own mini, but at DOFA they all become mini-Brooms. Similarly, in the usually bad and all too common &quot;the Disney family in high school&quot; stories, or other such mashups, the mini-Brooms may be used. <br><br>I&#39;ve created a list of possible minis, and I&#39;d like to see what everyone thinks. <br><br>Snow White: mini-Dwarfs.<br><br>Cinderella: mini-Pumpkins.<br><br>Sleeping Beauty: mini-Spinning Wheels.<br><br>Little Mermaid: mini-Seahorses.<br><br>Beauty and the Beast: mini-Beasts/Bells?<br><br>Aladdin: mini-Serpents.<br><br>Pocahontas: (this one is most subject to change. I envision something like wind spirits, denoted by colored leaves spinning in the air, as in the famous &quot;Paint With All the Colors of the Wind&quot; song.) mini-Wind gusts with leaves.<br><br>Mulan: mini-Mushus.<br><br>Princess and the Frog: mini-Gators.<br><br>Tangled: mini-Thugs.<br><br>Brave: mini-Bears (varying from Elinor to Mor&#39;du, depending on how bad the fic is).<br><br>Frozen: mini-Snowmen.<br><br>Oh, also, Scapegrace (if I&#39;m remembering correctly) suggested &quot;Minnies.&quot; I absolutely love the idea, but it doesn&#39;t work at DOFA, as Mickey himself isn&#39;t even present. But if any missions are done in the Disney canon outside of the Princess films, I think Minnies would be perfect.<br><br>Thoughts, suggestions, critique? Love to hear &#39;em!<br></p>

            <p>Mini-Percys are much better than mini-wind thingamabobs, and the mini-Beasts felt a bit off as well. <br><br>Nah, I&#39;m cool with the last two. Mini-Lucifers and mini-Diablos are fine by me. <br><br>The only other ones I could think of for Snow White would be mini-Apples or mini-Trees. More specifically, the scary trees from the sequence of Snow running away from the Evil Queen. But I don&#39;t particularly like that one-- no canon name. <br><br>If we stick with mini-Dwarfs, I would put it at sporker&#39;s discretion to choose a dwarf according to the general feel of the fic. If we want a set one, I would say mini-Grumpys. </p>

            <p>I just spent an hour writing up an email to you with a large number of corrections. <br>Which then refused to send.<br>And didn&#39;t save a draft.<br>I hate Yahoo.<br>I&#39;m afraid I&#39;m going to have to back out until I have my laptop back up and running, because Yahoo pretty clearly hates my Wii U.

            <p>Things can get pretty hairy out in the field, and if the Sue wins, then a backup team would get sent in... that&#39;s not going to mess up anybody else&#39;s storyline.<br><br>One &#39;Sue winning, in one fic, probably happens a lot. Agents aren&#39;t perfect, they make mistakes, and bad luck and the Ironic Overpower catch up with them. Then they have to run for it.<br><br>An Emergency would be an army of Sues invading HQ. A pair of agents overcome by a single particularly bad fic is nowhere near that. Even one Sue briefly in HQ isn&#39;t an emergency, provided she gets dealt with in short order. (I recommend luring her into a Reality Room. Unfortunately, the cafeteria meatloaf as an assassination technique still counts as torture.)<br><br>Emergency is not the same thing as &quot;agents in trouble&quot; or &quot;complicated mission&quot; or &quot;needing backup&quot;. It&#39;s what happens when a big thing forces everybody to participate whether they like it or not.<br><br>If our agents waltz happily through all their missions, never encountering any real obstacles or opposition, then they&#39;re not much better than the Sues they kill. There&#39;s got to be some challenge to the story, whether that&#39;s an argument with your partner, flying commas to dodge, or a desperate race to outthink a Warrior!Sue. Without challenge, it&#39;s just an MST.</p>

            <p>On occasion, a Sue has managed to capture an agent. Some simply don&#39;t have enough brains to do anything but stare dumbly at the agents, but this one was a genius/warrior!Sue with horrible grammar and horribly-OOC Legolas in her back pocket. The Sue melodramatically torturing an agent was the result. (Well, the Sue was melodramatic about it. The agent was just scared and pissed off.)<br><br>There are definitely other options, though. Some Sues would simply kill the agent, like Sakhmet tried to do to to Ithalond and Suicide. In other situations, the Sue is too brainless, passive, or non-combatant to do much, and it&#39;s her OOC canons, geographical abberations, and even punctuation storms that can kill the agents.<br><br>I haven&#39;t ever read a story in which the Sue won permanently, probably because if she did, the canon would be forever damaged. When the agents fail and die or go insane, another team goes in and finishes the job.<br><br>In my personal headcanon, Legendary Badfics aren&#39;t just the ones that are famously bad in World One, but the ones that have ended the careers of several agent pairs that tried to take them down.<br><br>Most of us don&#39;t really like to write stories where the Sue wins, but it&#39;s in the backstories of some characters with dead or insane ex-partners. And of course there are the various memorials.<br><br>If you think about it, the PPC has a lot of pretty dark implications. PPC agents are outright heroes who basically know the badfic is going to get them eventually and go for it anyway. On the plus side, there&#39;s the fact that many agents spend so much time in badfics and at HQ that by the time they die at, say, age 18, they&#39;ve subjectively experienced a couple of centuries.<br><br>So why don&#39;t we focus on the dark stuff... I&#39;ve thought about that, and here&#39;s the facts: If you go dark, if you go melodramatic and wallow in it instead of writing realistic characters in tough situations, then you&#39;re getting entirely too pink and glittery. Humor is one of the best ways to fight badfic; agents who can joke about the badfic are the ones who survive. It&#39;s kinda like the anthropic principle--If you&#39;re reading a mission report, it&#39;s because the agents survived to write it; and if they survived to write it, they must&#39;ve found a way to cope with the crazy. And whether that&#39;s humor, friendship, or just pure rage, every agent has a way to deal without going melodramatic.</p>

            <p>...because the Suvian beating the agent is more or less exactly what happened to Rayner&#39;s old partner, which is something I have plans to explain in a future interlude/&quot;flashback mission&quot;. Said Suvian also happened to be one of the most horrifically violent instances on record, but as noted, what happened was another instance showing that if one agent pair fails, another has to either help them out or take their place.<br><br>Also, @Calista, I think your post was supposed to be a reply to Des&#39; one, IDK. Said mission also happens to be one of my favorites as well, just so you know. That Sue&#39;s dismemberment at the end was well-deserved.</p>

            <p>&quot;Bloody hard days, okay pay, and no respect. Someone has got to do it, though. I mean, with some of HQ&#39;s agents locked up in fighting Sues on their home turf and loads more busy doing admin work, HQ needs a defence force. Plotholes plus murderous creatures equals really bad times; hell, I almost got taken over by a neural parasite the other day. I&#39;m not even sure if medical can fix that without cloning and psychografts. And that&#39;s not even covering what agents to do each other.&quot; He paused to scratch his nose. &quot;A week ago, we arrested a guy who was illegally cooking up Bleeprin in his kitchen. It was poor quality stuff and cut with god knows what-- but he was selling it cheap and people were buying it.&quot; The Guardsman sighed. &quot;And then there&#39;s the murderers but I don&#39;t wanna talk about that. Let&#39;s just say that with the weapons available and the general level of sanity in this place, people get <i>creative</i>.&quot;</p>

            <p>Dorothy in &quot;Wicked&quot;. She doesn&#39;t enter into the story much; in the musical she&#39;s only a shadow. But I think she&#39;s a parody sue, with the movie as her story. Why?<br><br>-She enters a canon with an involved backstory, factions, politics and religion, and simplifies it so that it revolves around her journey through it.<br><br>-She gathers allies that should want to stay rather far away from her, or at least not want to have much to do with her.<br><br>-Everything she does, without much apparent effort, is heralded as heroic.<br><br>-Despite being dropped into a totally unfamiliar environment and having to go on a journey, she&#39;s never hungry, cold, physically exhausted, etc.; her journey is more like a tour, and her hair and clothes stay perfect.<br><br>-She seems instinctively drawn to pink, glittery Glinda.<br><br>To be clear here, I&#39;m not saying that the original Oz book series had Dorothy as a Canon Sue; I&#39;m saying that &quot;Wicked&quot; turned her into one by making the world more serious, adult, and deep than it was in the books or in the movie based on them.</p>

            <p>Please don&#39;t pounce on me for this, too hard... but &quot;The Hobbit&quot; isn&#39;t really Tolkien&#39;s best work. (Which is kind of like saying, &quot;That dish isn&#39;t the best one available at this world-famous, wonderful restaurant&quot;, though. I for one thoroughly enjoyed it.)<br><br>&quot;The Hobbit&quot; was written back before Tolkien&#39;s world was properly fleshed out as it is in the trilogy and later on the Silmarillion. It&#39;s very much a bedtime story; it only gets complex near the end, when the focus widens into the battle over Smaug&#39;s treasure and many more people and places join the narrative. At that point you realize--wow, this story takes place in a larger world. The first time I read it, I found the transition a little jarring; I&#39;d been going along, reading it much like I would a fairy tale, and suddenly all of these other people with other motivations showed up and I had to keep track of them like I would while reading a novel with a much wider scope.<br><br>Also, Bilbo Baggins is not a silly name. It&#39;s a Hobbit name. So there. :)<br><br>As for Bilbo being a Stu from the perspective of the Silmarillion... Hmm... Well, in-canon, &quot;The Hobbit&quot; was written by Bilbo himself, and so of course it focuses on his experiences. It doesn&#39;t contain the bigger backstory because Bilbo didn&#39;t know the bigger backstory until later. Other characters are written as though they were exactly the way Bilbo perceives them.<br><br>I wouldn&#39;t go so far as to say that from the perspective of the Silmarillion, The Hobbit is a Suefic; I would say it&#39;s a genre-shift fic, from fictional-history to fairy-tale. It&#39;s about the same thing as the difference between &quot;Wicked&quot; and the Oz book series, a shift from drama to children&#39;s fiction. But the movie&#39;s Dorothy... well.</p>

            <p>It looks like they&#39;re saying that the later work written by a different author makes a certain character a *Parody* Sue in that work. You&#39;re (as far as I can tell) saying that a different work that came later turns a character in an earlier work into a regular Stu -- but they&#39;re talking within-the-work, not saying Wicked made Original!Dorothy a Sue. <br><br>Furthermore, the main difference is that Wicked *is* fanfic, whereas Tolkien&#39;s later works are, well, *his* later works. An author&#39;s early works are not fanfic of their later ones. </p>

            <p>You&#39;re onto something there. As a world expands in the hands of a good writer, the early, unformed stories in it can seem simplistic by comparison, even though standing on their own they&#39;re quite good.<br><br>Compare that to what happens when a bad writer writes a series or expands on a world--they get favorites, and their favorites get more and more sparkly, and the series gets more and more repetitive.

            <p>It was very entertaining, and you guys did a good job of explaining what was going on. I don&#39;t know anything about <i>Ranger&#39;s Apprentice</i>, but I was still able to easily follow that side of the mission. <br><br>The character interactions were brilliant, especially the stuff between Nume and Rina (I guess that went about as well as could be expected), and Ilraen and Zeb trying to do damage control on it. And I thought the way that Rina was showed as being unused to her new strength was a nice touch. <br><br>There was a lot of good scenes and nice lines. The bits that stuck in my mind particularly are:<br><br>- The bit where Nume refused Rina&#39;s help until she could &#39;string more than three words together&#39; and she arrived saying &#39;See? That was four words.&#39;. I thought that was a very good line on Rina&#39;s part. <br><br>- Nume&#39;s &#39;Tell me about it. Not literally&#39; and Ilraen&#39;s reaction.<br><br>- All four of them having to cram into the wardrobe at one point. I couldn&#39;t really tell who was supposed to be saying which line, but that didn&#39;t make that scene any less funny.<br> <br>- The exchange between Nume and Ilraen about carelessness: <br><i>&quot;I have never seen such carelessness.&quot;<br>&quot;Yes you have,&quot; Nume said.<br>&quot;Well, not toward horses.&quot;</i><br>I just found that last line very amusing. <br><br>- Silens being dealt with using a weapon that she&#39;d misused earlier was a nice touch (and the way that scene played out with Nume trying to charge her before it was technically too late was nicely done). <br><br>- And Nume going all &#39;drill sergeant&#39; on the random orcs was brilliant. I really like his lines there. <br><br>There were a few bits and pieces that I&#39;m not sure about:<br><br>- Nume and Ilraen were usually referred to as &#39;disentanglers&#39;, but there was one instance of calling them &#39;detanglers&#39;. I know both terms can be applied to DIC agents (actually, the wiki page says &#39;untanglers&#39; rather than &#39;detanglers&#39;, but it still makes sense as a name), but it just looks a bit odd when you use one term half a dozen times, and then a slightly different term just once - it just looks like a mistake to me. <br><br>- When Middle Earth shows up he gets referred to on one occasion as a mini-Barog (a mini-mini, one of the rarest creatures encountered by the PPC!).<br><br>- I was slightly puzzled by one of the earlier C-CAD readings &#39;[Charlie Treaty. Human female. Uncanon. 48% Sue and rising.]&#39;. Usually the percentages refer to how OOC a canon character is, and characters get classified as either: canon, bit, OC or Sue. It just looks a bit odd to me to see someone being classed as &#39;48% Sue&#39; (might just be that I&#39;m not familiar with the kind of readings you get from a C-CAD).  <br><br>- I was also puzzled by Rina&#39;s explanation of why the mini-Kalkara was so tall. It basically seems to be &#39;the original thing is tall, so the mini version is tall&#39;, but seven foot isn&#39;t <i>that</i> tall. If it were <i>seventy</i> feet then I could buy that explanation. As it is, it seems like her explanation should be more along the lines of &#39;yeah, <i>Ranger&#39;s Apprentice</i> has giant minis for some reason&#39;.<br><br>- Also, regarding Nume&#39;s dialogue, he uses &#39;Christ&#39; a couple of times, but there&#39;s a couple of times where he uses &#39;god&#39;. If he&#39;s using &#39;Christ&#39;, shouldn&#39;t he be using &#39;God&#39;? (There are a few times where he uses it at the beginning of a sentence, where it gets capitalised, but the couple of times he uses it mid-sentence it&#39;s uncapitalised). I think I might have asked about that before, but I can&#39;t remember what the answer was. <br><br>All in all, very enjoyable :)<br><br>- Irish</p>

            <p>Does anyone here enjoy reading about scambaiting (or 419baiting or scambusting or whatever you want to call it)?<br><br>You could say it&#39;s a sort of <b>Extreme</b> Sporking<font size="-1"><sup>(TM)</sup></font> that&#39;s similar to the PPC in many ways: the good guys create eccentric characters to tell a funny story that pokes fun at the flaws in the bad guys&#39; stories.

            <p>Basically, my brother and I got to see <i>Tomorrowland</i> last weekend, and we liked it. Very much. But, after mulling it over for a week or so (partly due to not having the time to type the review up sooner), I realized that for all the work that Brad Bird, George Clooney, and Disney in general put into it, and for all the shiny spectacle that it advertised, it ultimately turned out to be more than a little stale in hindsight.<br><br>Check out my in-depth review <a href="http://armorbirdpress.tumblr.com/post/126202967853/armor-bird-reviews-tomorrowland">here!</a></p>

            <p>This morning, I&#39;m woken up by my mom with a surprise: We&#39;re going to comic-con for the day! Woo-hoo, and all that jazz! So I get dressed, snarf my food, and we&#39;re off. <br><br>Well, once in the vendor room, I wander off on my own to look at the different stalls. While I&#39;m at one stall, I run into a lady with a dog. It&#39;s not a service animal from what I can see: no vest, no special leash.<br>So I ask her why she has a dog, because I&#39;m curious.<br><br>&quot;Oh, I have special clearance.&quot;<br><br>Anyway, we get to chatting about dogs, and I&#39;m petting hers, and he&#39;s a real sweetheart, all licky-licky and stuff. Very nice lady, but I don&#39;t think to ask for her name (or the dog&#39;s). <br><br>After about ten minutes, she says she has to go, she has a panel to attend, so we say good-bye and I go back to wandering. <br><br>Well, a few hours later, we go to a panel for a Q&amp;A with Carrie Fischer. For those of you who might not know, she&#39;s the lady who played Princess Leia in <i>Star Wars</i>. <br><br>When she finally appears, she&#39;s carrying her dog.<br><br><img src="http://s3-static-ak.buzzfed.com/static/campaign_images/terminal05/2012/8/31/17/things-that-blew-your-mind-when-you-were-a-kid-1-30991-1346448555-3_big.jpg" alt="http://s3-static-ak.buzzfed.com/static/campaign_images/terminal05/2012/8/31/17/things-that-blew-your-mind-when-you-were-a-kid-1-30991-1346448555-3_big.jpg"> </p>

            <p>It&#39;s taken me a while a get round to reviewing this, but I did enjoy the mission.<br><br>I also found it quite easy to follow, which was nice, as I know nothing about <i>Eragon</i> and very little about <i>Ratchet &amp; Clank</i>. There were a couple of points that I found hard to follow, the one that sticks in my mind the most was Des referring to the &#39;R.Y.N.O.&#39; - if you&#39;d used the full name, I would have been able to form a mental image of it (said image would&#39;ve been completely wrong, as I was picturing a large Gatling-style weapon before the page image loaded), as it was I had to pause in my reading to look it up. <br><br>In contrast, this scene about the OmniWrench:<br><i>“Well, it looks like Rhunön is about to waste her Brightsteel on making Ratchet a new wrench,” Zeb said, pinching the bridge of his nose. “She only used that for making the riders’ swords, gah!”<br><br>“Not to mention the OmniWrench Millennium 12 is made from teratannium, not this magical star-steel claptrap.” Des groaned. Eragon decided that since there isn’t any Brightsteel, he and his party would just leave. “You have got to be ...ing kidding me. No Speshul steel so you just go? What about just reforging the damn thing?! An iron Wrench is better than nothing!”<br><br>“She used Brightsteel to make a hammer,” Zeb said faintly. “She used it to make a hammer.”</i><br><br>This dialogue gave a lot of useful bits of information, and it felt completely natural. <br><br>The charge scene was particularly nice, especially Des running in screaming like that. I also liked how both the agents and the canon characters were actually doing stuff during that scene, rather than it just being a big speech as the charges were read. <br><br>Nicely done.<br><br>- Irish<br></p>

            <p>A few errors, though: <br>1) <i>He pointed at a large man wearing a green spandex suit that was impaled on a steel rod. “That’s Captain Qwark, and he’s dead.”</i><br><br>So was the man impaled, or just the suit? As written, you&#39;re saying that the suit was previously impaled on a steel rod, and the man is now wearing a suit with a hole in it.<br><br>2) <i>“If I managed to stay, so should have he… but never mind.”</i><br>Delete the &quot;have&quot;; it should simply be &quot;so should he&quot;.<br><br>3) <i>“Get her!” Des shouted, pointing at Rhunön, who was trying to run away. His distraction earned him an elbow in the belly; while he was catching his breath, Ratchet dove for his axe. He jumped on the Lombax and started pummelling him.</i><br><br>From the looks of this paragraph, there are three characters in this scene, all male: Des, Rhunön, and Ratchet.To whom, then, are all those &quot;he&quot;s referring? I ask because that last sentence cannot mean what it says: grammatically, its &quot;he&quot; refers to Ratchet, but that would mean that he jumped on himself!<br></p>

            <p>Not to denigrate or delegitimize what suffering you had, but your next sentence puts them in a very different light:<br><br>&quot;<i>Now I want to be the one to have my turn making other people&#39;s life [sic] a living hell</i>&quot;.<br><br>That&#39;s... well, it&#39;s nice to have goals, I suppose. Here&#39;s a suggestion for one, if you&#39;ll permit me to offer it.<br><br>Try - actually try - making it through sessions of cognitive therapy. You definitely need a course of that. You have anger issues. You want revenge on the people who made you suffer. I get that. I know what it feels like to have that gut-wrenching desire in the back of your head, telling you to <i>prove you&#39;re better than they made you believe you were</i>. It&#39;s quite likely at the root of my own issues with anger management, which you don&#39;t have to be a genius to figure out I possess (cf. my interactions with... at this point, half the Board, or so it seems).<br><br>I was made, by my peers at school and other people who shall remain nameless but really ought to have known better, to feel that my achievements were worth nothing, my positive attributes (such as they are) were in fact negative ones, my abilities were either pointless or inferior, and my ambitions laughable. I <i><b>hate</b></i> feeling like that. It burns in my brain like hellfire. I still seek to challenge people on stuff, assert my dominance, prove myself to be better at Thing X than Person Y. I still have revenge fantasies that go into the kind of terrifying detail that a giallo movie director would consider excessive. And I cannot stress the following enough:<br><br><i><b>THIS. IS. NOT. HEALTHY.</b></i><br><br>It&#39;s the same for you, it&#39;s the same for me. I am not in therapy because I can&#39;t afford it and I have a depressing tendency to lie like a rug to them. I wonder what your excuse is.<br><br>You were wronged by people, according to societal standards. We all have been. You must not dwell on it. Doing so will chew up your... not soul exactly, but the part of yourself that is your <i>self</i>, and after all the agony has been wrung from it, it will be spat back out, dripping with venom and rancid bile. I should never have let it happen to me, and I do not want it to happen to you.<br><br>Additionally, you have a correlation-causation error in your logic. If a person breaks a rule upon which society is by and large agreed, the rule is not (generally speaking) the problem. The <i>person</i> is. Doing away with the rules leads to <i>no threat of punishment</i>, which means a lot more people are going to start doing the things that you don&#39;t want them to do to you. And they will gang up on you, because humans are social animals and if you&#39;ve managed to get <i>Iximaz</i> this riled up then heaven knows what you&#39;re like with non-PPC people, and they will destroy you, and there will not be a single solitary thing you can do about it, because hey, you get to do what you want too. You just lack the means. Ain&#39;t nobody&#39;s fault but your own. <i>That</i> is what anarchy entails - and while I realise that a pro-government democratic socialist may have <i>some</i> internal biases against anarchism, even Bakunin realised it was impossible in a society still bound by scarcity-based economic structures (which even now all societies are, even the anarchist communes that are scattered around the nastier parts of the globe).<br><br>Finally, you think your revenge is &quot;rightful&quot;? I beg to differ. I seriously do. No revenge is rightful, because you do not have a right to it. You have a right to justice. You have a right to due process. And <i>so do they</i>. This is why trial by jury is even a thing in the first place - to stop endless cycles of blood feuding and needless death. Which, again, is anarchical.<br><br>But hey, you don&#39;t have to listen to mean ol&#39; Scapegrace. I&#39;m just another of those people defending your kids. I&#39;d be deeply shocked if you made it this far through the post, because you don&#39;t want to read it, and I think the reason that you don&#39;t want to read it is because you don&#39;t want to hear that your coping mechanisms are so fundamentally flawed you are making a leading member of an extraordinarily non-judgemental community tear her hair out in frustration at you. You don&#39;t want to hear that your bloodlust is wrong. So you won&#39;t hear it.<br><br>And you&#39;ll go back to your bunker with your collection of guns and your tinfoil <i>bloody</i> hat, waiting for the bombs to fall.<br><br>You worry me. You also repel me.</p>

            <p>That&#39;s not justice, and it doesn&#39;t help anybody. That&#39;s vengeance and all it does is further increase the suffering. Rather than helping the victims, it just makes more. Not to mention that it doesn&#39;t really help you.<br>While I didn&#39;t go through what Ix went through (and I consider myself very, very lucky for it) I did meet a couple of really nasty people, and, while I hate them — those lone two persons of all the people I know — I do not wish them ill because it won&#39;t take back my suffering, as it were, it won&#39;t make them better people and prevent others from suffering, and it will hurt them. Vengeance is very much pointless and very much to the detriment of everybody. <br>It also means, as Voyd said, that they won. You&#39;re one of them now, in mind if not in action... is that what you want? More people like that?</p>

            <p>I do not condone, nor do I believe it healthy. But I understand.<br><br>There is a reason &quot;an eye for an eye&quot; is a very popular form of punishment. Vengeance is a natural desire for almost all of us. There is a reason we have &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; guys. We want to see the bad people get what they have been giving out, if not more. Make them see what they have been doing. Make them pay for their crimes. We are naturally violent creatures. For most of us, we want to lash out, deep down.<br><br>But this is wrong.<br><br>Wanting to give people a taste of their own medicine is not justice, it is just as wrong. Scapegrace put it best. I think it would be in your best interest to listen to her. An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind. It just perpetuates the cycle of violence.<br><br>This does not, however, mean you should be passive. There are ways to strengthen yourself and starve out aggressors without being aggressive yourself. If the acts against you are verbal in nature, don&#39;t let it get to you. I know, it is hard. Trust me, I know. But if you starve them of the emotional response they want, the verbal aggressors will let you go. And what they want is either sadness or anger. They want you to either hate yourself, or hate them. If you respond either way, they win. Know that you are loved. Know there are people who root for you. Know there are good people in the world, and you are one of them. Remember this, and the verbal attacks hurt less and less over time, until you can start to see the bull for what it is.<br><br>If you are being attacked physically, learn self defense. Anything will do, though martial arts is usually the best. And I don&#39;t mean do flip-kicks to stop bullies before they get to you. I mean, know how to dodge or take a punch. Know pressure points. Know how you can disable physical aggressors with minimal risk to yourself and them. I would say learn Krav Maga, but given your current emotional state, that might not be a good idea. Judo, Jujitsu, even Karate might give you the confidence boost you need. However, I have to insist: if you turn a defensive art into an aggressive one, you have failed. You have fallen to their level, and become part of the problem. <br><br>There is one last thing I would suggest. And what I am about to say may sound bad, but I want you to listen when I say it. Seek therapy. I know it sounds like I am saying you have a mental disorder. You do not. Vengeance is a natural response to have. But, natural as it may be, it is not the healthy one. Therapy has this stigma as being only for the mentally troubled. All therapy really is is having someone there to talk to and give solutions for your problems. Everyone has problems! Sometimes, we all need some help with our emotions. They are trained professionals in sorting out how you feel, and moving forward in a helpful way.<br><br>Listen to Scape. Listen to me. You are not a bad person for feeling this way. But you need to rise above it. Be the better person.</p>

            <p>...is people like you and me being too weak or too unwilling (or both, since it&#39;s the same thing really) to fight back and turn the tables on the bullies.

            <p>What you describe is Hobbes&#39; bellum omnium contra omnes, the war of everybody against everybody else. It&#39;s not a solution, it&#39;s the problem. It just perpetuates itself. If everybody&#39;s a bully, then everybody&#39;s a bully; there&#39;s just a pecking order of bullies with bigger bullies bullying smaller bullies who in turn bully people below them.<br><br>What you suggest is just more suffering. Why do you want that? It&#39;s not good for anybody, least of all for you.<br><br>Furthermore: You are hurting people. You&#39;ve hurt Ix. Badly. D&#39;you have any idea what you&#39;re doing here?

            <p>Expressing your desire to make people suffer is a clear sign of losing it.

That&#39;s a universal truth; bullying won&#39;t stop if the victims start to torment their tormentors. Also, if you are not currenly are a victim, it will make you look like the thing you despise. I am no stranger to violence, but doing so just because &quot;I was a victim once&quot; makes you look like a D-list comic book villain.<br><br>From our conversations I thought of you as a reasonable lady.

            <p>You do realize that you just told Iximaz and by extension other bullying victims that <i>they are the reason they are being bullied</i>, ie textbook victim blaming? <i>No one</i> is ever to blame for being attacked or bullied. And fighting back might not solve the issue. It could very easily lead to escalations, it could lead to the victim being punished themselves. Because, newsflash! People are irrational and messy and the world we live in is unfair and painful. That doesn&#39;t mean that causing someone else pain is the answer. <br><br>And believe me, I know exactly how much it sucks to be told that if you ignore it it&#39;ll go away! But just because ignoring bullying doesn&#39;t work doesn&#39;t mean that fighting back tooth and nail will have any better results.</p>

            <p>I might not have yet learned to let the past go, but I don&#39;t want to perpetuate the cycle. You, on the other hand, are immature, twisted, and no better than the people you want to take &#39;revenge&#39; on.<br><br>You don&#39;t sit around and do nothing because it won&#39;t change things in the long run. You stand up for what is right, because nobody else has the guts to do so. You take a stand, and you say no, because this sort of thing is <i><b>not okay</b></i>.<br><br><br>Imagine dreading waking up in the mornings because you&#39;re going to have to spend the rest of your day looking over your shoulder.<br><br>You pretend to be sick just so you don&#39;t have to go to school. And sometimes you don&#39;t have to pretend because you&#39;re so scared of what&#39;s in store for you that day you actually do throw up.<br><br>You lie in bed at night wondering what&#39;s wrong with you and if it&#39;s not better if you just took yourself out of the picture, because you&#39;re apparently making everyone else&#39;s existence miserable. Because why else would they so routinely and maliciously pick on you?<br><br>And then their taunts get into your head, and you start believing that you are a loser, you are a weirdo, you are a freak.<br><br>You have nightmares about the things they did to you, even years after you last saw them.<br><br>A couple of the girls actually did suggest I kill myself.<br><br>And then they all laughed like it was the best joke in the world.<br><br>This is who <i>you</i> want to be. This is what <i>you</i> want to make others feel.<br><br>You are no better than them. You are <i>worse</i>, because you have felt what that is like, and you want to spread it to others. </p>

            <p>It wasn&#39;t because I was &#39;too weak&#39; or &#39;unwilling&#39; to fight back. That is a load of utter <i>bullshit</i>. <br><br>When you have the entire grade using you as their own personal chew toy, you don&#39;t have any witnesses to go to for help in backing you up. I would go to the adults, I would tell them what was going on. And they would either laugh it off as &#39;kids being kids&#39; or, if they bothered to get off their butts to investigate, they wouldn&#39;t be able to find a single person who would validate what I was saying because it was <i>funny</i> to play with me like that.<br><br>The few times I fought back, like when I punched the girl who pushed me in the pool, or bit the kids who were dogpiling and suffocating me, or broke the nose of the boy who asked me out just to dump me for a laugh, I was the one who got punished for not being able to control my temper and handle things in a mature way. <br><br>So I was told over and over that it was my fault that I was getting this sort of treatment. And hearing it again, from you, really does not make me happy.</p>

            <p>Yes, the city I call home has been around for 100 years now. How far this little tent city at Cook Inlet has come. From the founding location of the Alaska Railroad, to becoming the main trade port of Alaska, to becoming its largest city, Anchorage has a deep, rich history. We have gone through some rough times, but here we are, still going strong.<br><br>To celebrate this occasion, I am going to open myself up to questions about Alaskan history and culture. I would restrict it to Anchorage, but that is boring. Now, I know I did this once before and left you guys hanging, but at the time classes got too much for me so I could not answer many questions. However, I find myself with a few days off with little to do. So, I will answer any questions you have, to the best of my ability. It&#39;s good practice for me anyway, in case I get back into tourism.<br><br>So, please, fire away!<br><br>(If you are wondering, why now? Our locale NBC affiliate is running a special on it, and it inspired me to answer any questions you may have about my home.)</p>

            <p>Well, it all depends on where you go.<br><br>Now, before anybody calls that out as a cheap answer, you have to remember that Alaska is the size of 1/3 of all the U.S. So,  it would be like assuming the average temperature of Miami Florida is the same as in Des Moines Iowa.<br><br>As a side note, for all temperature measurements, I will be using Fahrenheit. Because I am a lazy American who does not want to open a temperature converter in the next tab.<br><br>Starting with Anchorage, as it is our centennial, the average winter temperature is around 10 degrees, though it has been known to get into the negatives. Well, that is the overall average. In recent years it has been getting much warmer. Snow was sticking on the ground by Halloween very reliably, except these last couple of years. This last year, we were hovering around the 30 degree mark for the average, and seeing as 32 is the freezing temperature, you can see how bad that can be. But, that is a soapbox I won&#39;t get on right now. Perhaps later in the Q&amp;A. <br><br>Now, what about the rest of the state? Since you went to Juneau, I might as well mention it. In the panhandle, it is closer to 25 degrees. Much warmer then the rest of the state.<br><br>How about our farthest north settlement? Barrow is at a toasty -15 degree temperature. Even better, it is a very wet cold, so the cold droops over you like a blanket trying to freeze you to death. Double that with literally no sun for several months, lends to a rather chilly time in the winter.<br><br>I hope that answered your question!<br><br>Now, with that over with; how did you enjoy the trip? I assume since you went through the panhandle, you took a cruse? What was your favorite part? Did you see any whales? Or Puffins? Puffins are my second favorite bird we have up here. So cute and fluffy.<br><br>If you ever do come back to Alaska, do let me know. I would love to show someone around!</p>

            <p>And I enjoyed myself immensely. We stopped in Canada once the way up. Sadly, we saw no puffins, but we did see a couple whales - the species escapes me - but they were large and quite impressive.

            <p>Probably humpback whales. They like to hang around up here, expecially in the warmer waters. They move around between the panhandle and Seward quite often.<br><br>Ah, darn. Not that it&#39;s suprising, as Puffins tend to stay in the Seward region. Sometines they go over to the cruse lins though, so I thought I would check.</p>

            <p>Medical perspective here:<br><br>Human hermaphrodites simply don&#39;t exist in the Real World--or if they do, I&#39;ve never heard of one existing. A hermaphroditic organism has the equipment for both sexes and can reproduce as either the &quot;mother&quot; or &quot;father&quot;. Some hermaphroditic organisms can reproduce with themselves.<br><br>What humans can be is intersex--being in-between due to hormones or chromosomes or environment or some combination thereof. If you study prenatal development, basically we all start out with a female configuration, and a male fetus will switch over during development. So, if a female gets some of the &quot;be male&quot; signals, or a male doesn&#39;t, the result can be a baby whose gender is hard to determine. They will have ovaries or testes or something in between; their external genitalia can be either type or in between. Some intersex people look very much like a typical member of one gender or the other; some look in-between androgynous. Their gender identity and the people they&#39;re attracted to can be anything in the human spectrum.<br><br>Barring a hypothetical very rare partly-fused chimera or conjoined twin situation, human hermaphrodites don&#39;t exist because humans only get one set of reproductive organs apiece. That means that the only hermaphrodites are in mythology, fiction, porn, and the animal kingdom. Since porn and animals are the most common places for hermaphrodites to be mentioned, it is entirely understandable that intersex people do not want to be called &quot;hermaphrodites&quot;, as they&#39;re neither sex objects nor less than human.<br><br>As for &quot;androgynous&quot;, it refers more to the way you present yourself, your identity, or your appearance. I&#39;m mildly androgynous, with both feminine and masculine traits, even though I look quite feminine and have XX chromosomes and don&#39;t mind marking &quot;female&quot; on forms if there&#39;s no other choice. Other people are much more strongly androgyne or neutrois and feel quite horrible if they are pushed into one gender box or the other. Quite a few deities and mythical creatures are in-between androgynous as well, looking like somewhat feminine teen boys or somewhat masculine teen girls in drawings and statuary; many deities are able to change shape or change gender at will and may be depicted as any gender by various artists. A person&#39;s reproductive equipment is rather irrelevant to the term &quot;androgynous&quot;.</p>

            <p>I <i>knew</i> my Tolkienverse knowledge was a little rusty. E.V.L.&#39;s mistake was entirely my fault; I&#39;ve changed the wording so that Brenda initially guesses about the mountains, but E.V.L. corrects her and brings up the river like you said. (Come to think of it, the Anduin wasn&#39;t even mentioned when the Sue got taken to Lothlórien. So the geography charge still stands, just with a different landmark.)<br><br>Y&#39;know what, for future LoTR missions, I wonder if anyone better versed in the works of Tolkien could link me to a complete map of Middle-earth for geography reference.

Unless, like me, this beast somehow exhibits explicit anatomy of the opposite gend—”<br><br>She stopped, covering her mouth, but it was too late. Rayner gave her an expression of even greater horror and disgust than he’d done at the mention of the pregnant male elk.<br><br>“You’ve got a — got a —” he gasped, pointing at her with a very shaky hand.<br><br>She tossed her hair and glared at him. “Well, now you know why I appreciate both genders equally,” she said. “If you want to know the reason for it being there, the Biblical Lilith has been stated to be androgynous by some religious scholars, so my author ran with it. This is between us and us alone, so let us never speak of it again.”</i><br><br>I have a couple of issues with this passage.<br><br>1) Speaking from experience, if you&#39;ve got a secret that you don&#39;t want anyone to find out, you don&#39;t slip up that easily. Ever. E.V.L. acting all shocked that she &#39;let that slip&#39; came across as just that to me: an act. It sounds like she just wanted an excuse to say she was intersex.<br><br>2) So, what, she&#39;s bisexual just because she&#39;s intersex? You... do realize that intersex people can be both straight and gay? Being intersex does not make a person bi. If that&#39;s not what you meant, you have a really funky way of writing that correlation, because the way it is now, you have it sounding like you can only be bi if you&#39;re intersex.<br><br>3) Androgynous =/= hermaphrodite. Androgynous refers to outward appearance. For example, most people can&#39;t tell I&#39;m female unless I deliberately dress so there&#39;s no question. That&#39;s androgynous. An intersex person usually (but not always) looks like one or the other, and simply have, ahem, the equipment of both sexes. This is the case with E.V.L., though if you got the idea to make her intersex because you confused androgyny for hermaphroditism (which is just an old word used for the more technically accurate term of intersex), this might not be entirely applicable to her. Not saying she can&#39;t be intersex, just that you got your terms mixed up.<br><br>-Iximaz, who is androgynous, not intersex, thank you. </p>

            <p>Well, probably as hermaphroditic, but I put the more acceptable term in the header. ;)<br><br>-- actually, Wikipedia says this:<br><br><i>The mystical writing of two brothers Jacob and Isaac Hacohen, which predates the Zohar by a few decades, states that Samael and Lilith are in the shape of an androgynous being, double-faced, born out of the emanation of the Throne of Glory and corresponding in the spiritual realm to Adam and Eve, who were likewise born as a hermaphrodite.</i><br><br>I think &#39;andro-gynous&#39; (which looks like &#39;man-woman&#39; to me) once had the meaning of hermaphroditic/intersex, rather than the reverse. So the idea is that the first two people were Lilith and Adam-Eve; when Lilith rebelled, Adam-Eve was split into Adam and Eve.<br><br>(Actually, in this case, both &#39;androgynous&#39; and &#39;hermaphrodite&#39; appear to mean &#39;two entire people joined together&#39;... which is something else entirely, of course.)<br><br>(Hey, new idea - maybe Kabbalistic texts from the 1200s aren&#39;t terribly consistent in themselves?

            <p><i>“I’m sure Medical would be able to handle something like this,” said E.V.L. “But still… There is no way such an occurrence would be possible.”<br>“So, how do you get a male elk pregnant?” asked Feratu.<br>“The same way I tried to get Link pregnant in the LoZ bad slash fic I once starred in,” E.V.L. replied with a grim look. “Just stick it in and enjoy the show.”<br>“But how?” asked Brenda. “You’re a girl!”<br>Rayner turned slightly pale. “I’ve seen visions of you in my thoughts, dreams, visions maybe... So you’re telling me, uh, us... that you weren’t, in fact, wearing a strapon?”<br>She tossed her hair and glared at him. “Unfortunately, yes,” she said. “I once possessed a male canon, and suffice it to say that it left a lasting impression. This is between us and us alone, so let us never speak of it again.”</i><br><br>Notice that the terms discussed here are not mentioned even once. I also changed the wording to imply that Rayner suspected that E.V.L. had some extra plumbing, but didn’t think it was genuine.<br><br>In hindsight, it was my mistake to use Wikipedia and a quick Google search as an attempt at verification, and I apologize for wording the original version in a manner that may sound offensive to some. E.V.L. having, well, those bits was an idea I&#39;ve had for years, but couldn&#39;t really define the specifics for until now. I personally think it&#39;s for the better that instead of any theological topics, she&#39;d have obtained it by possessing a guy, with a less than desirable outcome. Kinda like what happened to Cadmar, but in reverse.</p>

            <p>Getting out my biology and human sexuality classes info... <br><br>Terminology guide for sci-fi, fantasy, and non-human gender and sexual orientation:<br><br>Hermaphrodite: An organism with the sexual organs of both genders. Usually refers to entire species, and refers to the typical state of affairs within these species. Hermaphroditic organisms may or may not be able to reproduce on their own, but when engaging in sexual reproduction they are able to either impregnate or be impregnated. Use this word for non-human species that fit this description. Most Flowers are hermaphrodites. Gender and sexual orientation may or may not be meaningless to hermaphroditic species; some adopt gender labels out of convenience or preference. Sequential hermaphrodites, which switch from one biological sex to the other during their lifetimes, may or may not switch from one gender identity to the other as well.<br><br>Intersex: An atypical condition found in species with two or more genders; refers to those individuals which cannot easily be categorized, physically, as one gender or the other. May be attracted to either gender, both, all, or none; may have any gender identity. Ex: Intersexed person, gender identity male, attracted to females, would be heterosexual; if gender identity is female, then homosexual.<br><br>Asexual (Biology): The condition of having no gender. Refers to entire species; for example, amoebas. May reproduce by fission, spores, etc. Gender identity and sexual orientation are probably meaningless to these species; some adopt gender labels out of convenience or preference. Since they do not reproduce sexually, these creatures may not have a sexual orientation, or may be asexual in terms of sexual orientation.<br><br>Asexual (Orientation): A sexual orientation found among species which reproduce sexually; lack of sexual attraction to all genders. Asexual individuals can identify as any gender or none at all. They may desire platonic romance and have gender preferences for partners, or not desire platonic romance at all. Most biologically asexual creatures can be described as asexual in orientation as well, though their species probably does not have a distinct concept of &quot;asexual&quot; unless they have been in contact with species which are not biologically asexual.<br><br>Bisexual: An individual, usually from a species which has genders, attracted to two of those genders. In species with three or more genders, &quot;trisexual&quot;, etc., may be an appropriate category (but must be differentiated from the old &quot;I&#39;m trisexual; I&#39;ll try anything once&quot; joke).<br><br>Pansexual: An individual attracted to other individuals regardless of gender. Different from bisexual in that it encompasses those who do not fit into the two genders that bisexual people are attracted to. Will still have preferences regarding age, personality, species, etc.<br><br>Homosexual/Heterosexual: Attracted to one&#39;s own/the opposite gender. This designation can only apply to people who have a gender identity, and usually in the context of a species with two main gender categories.<br><br>Androsexual; Androphilic: Attracted to males. Different from &quot;Straight female&quot; or &quot;Gay male&quot; in that it can be used to describe those who are neither female nor male, or are both.<br><br>Gynosexual; Gynophilic: Attracted to females; useful for describing those who are neither/both female and/nor male.<br><br>Agender; nongender; gender-neutral; androgynous: Some of the many words used to describe people who identify as having no gender. Applies to most creatures who are biologically asexual and many who are hermaphroditic, as well as some individuals from species with sexes. May be attracted to one or more genders, all, or none.<br><br>Genderqueer: As a general term, non-binary people in a species with a binary (or trinary, etc.) gender divide. May be attracted to one or more genders, all, or none. As a specific term, unlike agender (etc.) individuals, genderqueer individuals may identify as one gender or another at different times during their lifetime, switching genders. Sequential hermaphrodites may or may not be described as genderqueer.<br><br>Transgender: Someone with a biological sex that does not match their gender identity. Both the biological sex and the gender identity can be anything, including neutrois (physically non-gendered), as well as the binary (trinary, etc.) genders. Use their gender identity to describe their sexual orientation; for example, someone with a female gender identity, attracted to females, is homosexual even if their biological sex is male. Depending on the species, this may be a very typical condition or a very unusual one.<br><br>Xenosexual: Someone attracted to those from a different species from their own. Generally unusual, but some species are xenosexual by default (cf. Mass Effect Asari). Usually also has preferences regarding gender, age, etc., and may be attracted to one species, some, or all. Assumes sapient (able to consent) species only.</p>

            <p>No, this is not some bizarre spin-off of the 90&#39;s TV show <i>Where on Earth is Carmen Sandiego?</i>, but rather an announcement that I might be in America, specifically Virginia (I realise that&#39;s not <i>that</i> specific, but that&#39;s the best info I&#39;ve got at the moment), a couple of weeks from now. <br><br>The trip hasn&#39;t been confirmed yet, so details are a bit wishy-washy (maybe even wibbly-wobbly, hopefully not timey-wimey), but basically my company is looking at sending me out for work around the 26th, so I&#39;m potentially around for the weekend of the 29th. <br><br>So, anyone free that weekend and feel like Gathering? And if so, whereabouts are you? Obviously if we can get a bunch of people together in one place that&#39;d be cool, but I appreciate that can be quite difficult in somewhere as big as America. It doesn&#39;t have to be in Virginia, I can easily do some internal flights. <br><br>I know it might seem premature to start trying to organise anything before I even know if I&#39;m coming or not, but I probably won&#39;t get confirmation for another week at the earliest, and I figured if I wait until I do know for sure before I start planning, I might find I&#39;ve run out of time. <br><br>So, yeah, interested?<br><br>- Irish</p>

            <p>Which sucks for two reasons:<br>1) I won&#39;t be able to piggyback a trip of my own on it, so can&#39;t do a Virginia / Indiana Gathering. <br>2) Although my visit isn&#39;t happening, the project is still going ahead. So I get to work with incomplete and second-hand information, because I don&#39;t get to go and see it for myself. Yay, fun times!<br><br>However, we are dealing with other American projects, so there is still a chance I&#39;ll be sent out again. I just don&#39;t know when or where. Hopefully any future trips will be planned well enough in advance that I&#39;ll know for definite that I&#39;m going before bringing it up on the Board.<br><br>- Irish</p>

            <p>As far as internal flights go, I&#39;m not that bothered by the time or distance involved. I figure I&#39;ll have to fly <i>somewhere</i> for this, and I&#39;ll have done an 8 hour flight just to get to America in the first place, so even if I ended up going across to the other coast, it wouldn&#39;t be a huge issue for me.<br><br>The only issue I will have is the cost - while my company will cover all my work related expenses, if I want to tack a holiday on the end it&#39;ll come  out of my own pocket. <br><br>Indianapolis certainly looks doable to me. Obviously I&#39;ll have to see what other locations people come up with, and how many people can make it to each one (and actually confirm that my trip is actually happening) before making a decision, but that&#39;s looking good to me :)<br><br>- Irish</p>
