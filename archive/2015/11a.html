I&#39;m going to be using this month to put some serious work into the thing I hinted at in my last post. {= ) It shouldn&#39;t reach 50,000 words (dear Glod, I <i>hope</i> it doesn&#39;t reach 50,000 words; that would be ridiculous), but if I can get it at least half done, I&#39;ll be pretty happy.

            <p>A twist on the Badfic thread, let&#39;s talk about some BadFics, as well as some GoodFics.<br><br><b>Good - <a href="http://archiveofourown.org/works/3335588"> Shine by AquaFish</a> - RWBY</b> - Smut warning, not main focus<br>Shine is what happens when a Sue tries to bed Jaune, but fails. Miserably. Peony Bloom is our Yandere taken to a Sue-Like extreme, with Fan-Pistols and Hanami as a semblance. In her quest for Jaune Jr, she relentlessly harasses Pyrrha, taken to a semi-logical extreme with Pyrrha almost dying trying to retrieve her coronet from an on campus lake during the winter months. Luckily Jaune was there, who at the time was in a forced relationship with Peony, he broke up shortly after and started dating Pyrrha, but Peony still wants the Varazin (Des should get that Framed joke)! Later chapters involve attempted, but thankfully non-trivialized, rape (female on male too, amazing!), The <strike>Beach</strike> Pool Chapter, Coco&#39;s drink party (that was a fun chapter), and a single smut chapter.<br><br><b>Bad - <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10681396/1/Remnants-of-Olympus">Remnants of Olympus by Rhyfeddol</a> - RWBY/Heroes of Olympus</b><br>In this fic, the author inserts Team RWBY into the plot of The Heroes of Olympus. Let me explain that better: Hera did not mess with Jason and Percy, RWBY arrives at camp and suddenly it&#39;s the start of the second great prophecy. The Greek aspect of The Seven plus Team RWBY then take a plane ride (luckily Percy and the plane conundrum stuff is still around) to the Camp Jupiter area, meet up with the Roman aspect of The Seven, then take on the quest to Alaska to close the doors of death. That&#39;s as far as I could get without raging. I also find the need to say the Blake describes, and I quote, &quot;[Percy] was only marginally more skilled than Jaune Arc.&quot; My friend, Percy is at the marginal swordplay level of Pyrrha, not Jaune. Jaune could learn something from Percy. The story is apparently complete, but with 15 chapters plus a 2 chapter epilogue, I wouldn&#39;t recommend the Time Lord Touch.</p>

Oh a few people have made them in the fandom but usually they are just anime girls written by those who are too young to know better.<br>This one  however is literally a story of a hurricane Katrina oc raping Aph America over the days she was alive. That in itself is bad enough but then the author tries to claim Aph Amercia likes it somehow. And then somehow expects us to feel sorry for the hurricane. As someone who lived through Katrina  I can tell you this is disrespectful to the max. Not for the faint of heart at all.<br><br>Good- <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6122026/1/Gutters"><a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6122026/1/Gutters">https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6122026/1/Gutters</a></a><br>Warning for death,violence,the world ending,floods,earthquakes,and so many things.<br><br>This is a fanfic known through out the fandom as a tear jerker to the max. One of the most recommended,and when you read it you see why. The plot is Many nations have fallen,no one is sure we&#39;re it&#39;s safe,and aph Denmark and Aph Sealand only have each other right now.  The characters are well written. The grammar is good. I want to say more but I fear for spoiling it.  It also has another fanfic conerned to it written my the author  and some spin offs written by fans of the work. I can&#39;t attest to those however,just Gutters. <br><br><br></p>

            <p>Twilight X Harry Potter Bleefic - Bella Marie Potter Cullen: The Girl Who Lived - I can&#39;t find the original copy of the fic, so I hope  <a href="http://das-sporking.livejournal.com/170063.html">the sporking by Zelda Queen from Das Sporking</a> will suffice for your entertainment, even if it means we probably can&#39;t mission it . Seriously, doesn&#39;t that title alone make you cringe? It was practically impossible for this thing to have been anything other than an absolute train-wreck from the very beginning!<br><br><a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5512604/1/Because">Because</a> - Sailor Moon - I&#39;m more confused than anything else about this songfic. If this wasn&#39;t a songfic or if the author had chosen a different song, it might have been decent. At it stands, on one hand we have a cute hurt/comfort story about Serena and Rini comforting each other after Darien gets hurt. But on the other hand, the meaning of the lyrics of the song Because of You, by Kelly Clarkson, completely contradict the dialogue that precedes them, which copy them almost word for word but still gets the meaning wrong. <br><br><p><b>Fics that I&#39;m unsure of how to feel about</b>.</p>
<br><br><a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2050803/1/Arthur-Goes-Fourth">Arthur goes Fourth and Arthur goes Fifth Series</a> - Rated K+, but you could probably argue that rating is far too low <br> Introduces uncanonical and dark elements like Aids, drugs and war. Also introduces other uncanonical but more silly elements like time travel and unicorns. I will leave it up to you to judge wheter the writing is good enough to excuse this or not. <br><br><a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8134552/">Respect</a> - Puella Magi Madoka Magical X Smile Pretty Cure - Rated T - Darkfic, Horror, contains extreme violence, angst and disturbing imagery. <br><br>If this was a standalone Madoka darkfic, it would be pretty par of the course. A story about a budding artist getting brutally bullied because of her &quot;childish&quot; interesting, who then made a contract with Kyubey, making a wish that people would respect her drawing, which then resulted in her getting a sketchbook capable of trapping and killing people, would be the sort of thing that would pretty much expect from the Madoka fandom.<br><br>But as you may have noticed, this is a crossover with Smile Pretty Cure and the character in question is Yayoi Kise. Who kills her own mother, the 4 Pretty Cures, Candy and practically the entire town, including the police force. There is also the matter of the cross-canon contamination of Yayoi eventually becoming a Witch, not just any Witch mind you, but especifically, Izabel, the Artist Witch. I&#39;m pretty sure that having a canon from one continuum become a canon from another, entirely unrelated continuum would be... problematic to say the least.  <br><br><br><br><br></p>

            <p>Some of the fics being that were sporked there are unbelievably awful and can&#39;t be found anywhere else, like this train-wreck of a bleepfic and the Ariana Black series.<br>The problem is precisely that they can&#39;t found outside Mervin&#39;s site. Aside from how hard it would to acess the thing, other than maybe by either asking Das Mervin to supply the original or asking permission to copy off the original fic text from the sporkings, I also have to wonder if our policy about deleted/abandoned badfics would apply in such cases or not. <br><br>I, for one, would love to see these things being taken out, but I don&#39;t know if we would be allowed to do so.<br></p>

            <p>Where did you see that they cannot be used for a mission? I mean, Iximaz and Des&#39; latest mission was about an unfinished fanfic abandonnd since 2003, so it seems to me you can mission them, provided they&#39;re bad enough. As for the text, you could ask it to Zeldaqueen, it still could somewhere in her computer.</p>

            <p>Heck, in the Airhead sporking, Mervin and Hyde make frequent references to the PPC. I was actually thinking of claiming Child of Grace, Airhead herself, and that one Edward/Cas fic (because Cas is clearly a replacement Sue, which puts him in the DMS&#39;s purview).<br>(Mostly this is because my spinoff is planned to be set in the past, and I can barely find any badfic that fits the timeline. ;_;)</p>

            <p>Namely Twilight Goodfics. *dodges suppression fire* They&#39;re worth it, I swear.<br><br>Anyone here knows the website <a href="http://das-sporking.livejournal.com/">Das Sporking</a>, Mervin and her sister Mrs Hyde, right? Back to 20009, Hydee began a revamp of Twilight the first, &#39;The Blue Hour&#39;, taking any part of the book worth of something, and her <a href="http://das-mervin.livejournal.com/181631.html">two first</a> <a href="http://das-mervin.livejournal.com/181936.html">unbetaed chapters</a>, an alternative take on Meyer&#39;s &#39;Chapter One&#39;, were already superior to the whole book. At no moment you&#39;ll want to fishslap Bella here.<br><br>Unfortunately, the rest of this work isn&#39;t published, since Mrs Hyde wants to publish it only after she finished it (She was halfway through the last year, does anyone have more recent informations, please?).<br><br>However, she also published four short stories too, rewriting the Cullen in order to show what&#39;s Meyer failed to see, and recreating good characters. Success was total.<br><br>-First one, <a href="http://das-mervin.livejournal.com/177618.html">The Darkest Hour</a>, her take on Edward&#39;s descent to darkness before the main series. Yes I&#39;m calling him Edward, because this one DESERVES it. For more informations, read this story.<br><br>-<a href="http://das-mervin.livejournal.com/262095.html">The Thorns Remains</a>, rewriting Rosalie&#39;s backstory to something more fitting than a banker&#39;s daughter in Great Depression killed by her fiancee.<br><br>-<a href="http://das-mervin.livejournal.com/288086.html">His Brother&#39;s Keeper</a>, about Emmett. Once again, any canon worht its salt is used. Oh, and &#39;Growing Up Cullen&#39; too.<br><br>-<a href="http://das-mervin.livejournal.com/291731.html">Curiouser and Curiouser</a>, featuring Alice. You hated female Wardo? You&#39;ll love vampiric Luna Lovegood.<br><br>Oh, last thing. Mrs Hyde also expressed the desire of rewriting the whole mess, and since she&#39;s ditching some of the sick elements, like imprinting and love traingle, I can only hope she does it.<br><br>Seriously, read this guys. You&#39;ll wish an OFU could be based upon this, just for imagining the heads of the Twitards.</p>

            <p>But it was too awesome for being ignored. Seriously, I wish Twilight was a Legendary Badfic of Hyde&#39;s work, and that the latter could be used for an OFU, just imagine Mervin and Hyde Coordinators , fishslapping fanbrats to submission and GOOD writing. Heck, someone should use it as an idea for an Agent, an AU where Meyer is an unpublished Suethor and Hyde takes the credit. Sending such an Agent to a Twilight would be so cruel, so funny.<br><br>Yeah, I&#39;ll check the others too.

            <p>As far as I&#39;m concerned, Twilight <i>is</i> a badfic. Of Meyer&#39;s... ahem... dream. It certainly has the right level of quality. It&#39;d be kinda nice if you could take IP off someone by virtue of them being too incompetent to look after it properly. That would be abusable, though. Sadly.</p>

            <p>If it was any other fandom, Luminosity would be badfic. Your description is correct: Twilight with a rational Bella. Unfortunately, few of the other things that make Twilight so awful are changed. Bella is still a sociopath who has to force herself to feel emotion and who matches up her friends for utterly selfish reasons; Edward is still a dick; Alice is still annoying (and <strike>IF SHE DOESN&#39;T REMEMBER BEING A HUMAN, WHY DOES SHE ACT LIKE ONE</strike> her backstory doesn&#39;t gel with her characterisation); Rosalie is still a Scary Sue with a baby fetish; vampires still have biology failure; it&#39;s still anti-human; there&#39;s still a lot of rape imagery (metaphorical here, but still)...<br>I could go on. At least there&#39;s actual <i>plot</i> eventually.</p>

            <p>Some people like it. Heck, my best friend likes it. Probably because it&#39;s better than Meyer&#39;s work, which makes it something that people like to latch on to and rub in Meyer&#39;s face.

The resulting story is, for lack of a better word, AMAZING. The author updates it almost every day and manages to perfectly blend sadness, comedy, heartwarming, and balls-to-the-wall awesomeness. If you liked Jurassic World, read it. If you thought Jurassic World could have been better, READ IT. It&#39;s definitely worth the time.</p>

Some of them just haven&#39;t been properly introduced outside of RPs yet. Finally, the character in the middle of the bottom row has white hair. It only occurred to me now that I should have put them on a grey background or something. Something to keep in mind for the future.</p>

            <p>Yeah, that&#39;s what I meant. A yellow t-shirt with a yellow leather coat over it. And you even did the Crest Tag! Also, Quidditch robes weren&#39;t what I originally had in mind, but come to think about it, they would be what would work best. Henry is still obsessed with the game and the colors really match. Again, thank you, this is awesome. I will have to find a way to use this after I publish my first mission and therefore am able to create their Wiki pages.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m probably going to use the first prompt as the basis for either an interlude set prior their first mission or the pre-mission section of the aforementioned mission. As such, I want to fix the problems you mentioned. Now, two of them were mostly technical issues I should be able to resolve quite easily. So I want to talk about the problem with the reference. <br><br>Now, I know it&#39;s a bit unorthodox to mention a fic other than the badfic being sporked, specially, as in this case, when it&#39;s goodfic.But Henry had to go through at least some Agent Training, even if it was for woefully short time. So I hope it&#39;s not unreasonable to assume that he had time to hear about at least one goodfic from his home continuum. I mean, he theoritically would have had the time to pick up some fanons aside from HP, so why not throw in a HP fic in there as well? <br><br>Would an explanation in that vein suffice? And if not, would you any suggestions for one that would work? Or should I just throw this reference out?    </p>

            <p>So, you guys all know that infamous <i>Avatar: The Last Airbender</i> fancomic &quot;How I Became Yours&quot;?<br><br><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dOWnfUuUOFEueDDbVSm8yD3Szd61fMNo4wWOe5dB9wE/edit?usp=sharing">I decided to spork it.</a><br><br>The format&#39;s a bit different compared to the standard mission since it&#39;s, well, a comic, but I think it worked out okay in the end. :) Enjoy, guys!<br><br>***<br><br>I swear there will be proper agent reunions and things in the future! My cowriters are just a tiny bit busy at the moment, so I decided to go ahead and get the ball rolling with this. Because let&#39;s face it, you all knew Zeb and the Aviator would be repartnered eventually. :P<br><br>*departs with a swirly cloak effect and the promise of historical releases*</p>

            <p>I believe we&#39;ve already discussed the possibility of a Sonichu mission <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=274761;">before</a>, but personally, I&#39;m not sure if sporking the Sonichu comics would be a good idea. I haven&#39;t read the comics myself, but from what I do know, the author was so devoted to the comic that it&#39;s become a sort of twisted autobiography of his, and he&#39;s even used M-rated art of the characters to attempt to respond to 4chan trolls. I&#39;m not so concerned about how a mission into the comic would go in-universe (and I&#39;m sure a lot of agents would be able to handle it just fine), but I don&#39;t know if anyone can pull off said mission without looking like we&#39;re attacking Chris-chan himself - and even if it isn&#39;t, he&#39;ll still see it as mockery of him no matter what we try to say.<br><br>I don&#39;t know, really. The possibility of a Sonichu mission may still be there if you handle the material extremely carefully, but I still think it&#39;ll be way too risky for its worth.</p>

            <p>Because the thing is, we don&#39;t let the authors of works know that they&#39;re getting the PPC treatment as a general rule. Additionally, all the stuff you mentioned happens after around Issue 8 - so as long as we kill it before then, it&#39;s all good.<br><br>Besides which, if he stumbles upon it and takes exception, it&#39;s just Chris-chan taking exception to any and all criticism. This is a guy who issues rebuttals to 4chan comments; in the face of actual concrit (a Neshomeh&#39;s Notes-style thing at the end would go a long way to helping with this), I&#39;d wager he&#39;ll either wilt or make himself look even more ridiculous than normal.

            <p>... why Palpatine was so appallingly bad at choosing apprentices.<br><br>I mean, really: the purpose of the Sith Apprentice, under the Rule of Two, is to eventually surpass her* master and become the new Master, maintaining the secret and continuing to increase Sith dominance of the galaxy.<br><br>(*Darth Zannah finds your assumption that the Apprentice should be male hilarious. Also you just got lightsaber&#39;d.)<br><br>Palpy was a good choice for this - he&#39;s a politician, so he can sneak in Sith agendas without anyone noticing. (In the books, Plagueis was a high-profile banker, his master Tenebrous was a famous starship designer, <i>his</i> master seems to have been a prominent scientist... you get the picture). But his apprentices? From the films:<br><br>-Darth Maul, a brutal fighter with no sense of subtlety. He&#39;s outright <i>eager</i> to reveal the secret the Sith have kept for a millennium.<br>-Count Dooku, a known fallen Jedi. &#39;The evil Force user we didn&#39;t know about was actually the evil Force user we <i>did</i> know about? How did this happen?!&#39; Yeah, no.<br>-Anakin &#39;emotionally-crippled half-cyborg&#39; Skywalker. Admittedly by that time Sidious had decided to become immortal and skip the whole &#39;decent apprentice&#39; thing, but still!<br><br>The books explain Maul as being an illicit &#39;apprentice&#39; while Plagueis was still alive, but that still doesn&#39;t explain Dooku. Palpatine never takes - or even seems to look for - a decent Apprentice, just a series of tools and weapons. The idea that this is because there are <i>already</i> two Sith in play - one a prominent politician on his way to becoming Supreme Chancellor, the other a friend of the Jedi, famous general, and member of the <i>opposition</i> in the Senate (inasmuch as they have one, Padme&#39;s group is in it)... yep, that works.<br><br>The only question (and one which the theory doesn&#39;t actually answer) is the one Yoda and Mace consider at the end of TPM: which one is the Master, and which the Apprentice?<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Because I like you all so much, I&#39;ll include all of the extended answers I see, with context. I&#39;ll even remove swearing, where needed. OP&#39;s answers will be in bold, with context above.<br>---------------------<br>Ghost0fBanquo<br>Part of me wants to believe this.<br><br>Part of me hopes this is true.<br><br><b>Lumpawarroo<br>You have to admit it might change a lot of people&#39;s opinion on the prequels in a fundamental way.<br><br>All it would take was a few well-done flashbacks.<br><br>And you have to wonder, why didn&#39;t the Empire collapse with Palpatine&#39;s death like we all assumed would have? That&#39;s usually what happens with dictatorships.<br><br>And yet 30 years after the good guys &quot;win,&quot; we still have TIE fighters and mega-weapons and Star Destroyers and Storm Troopers still Storm-Trooping it up...<br><br>Maybe the real dictator didn&#39;t die. But it has to be a character we&#39;re familiar with; if Snoke is just some unknown dude that appears from out of nowhere, that&#39;s pretty lame. Are there just random Sith hanging out beyond the edge of the galaxy, ready to swoop in and claim power every time one is defeated? That&#39;s contrived, and make&#39;s the whole OT pointless.<br><br>To resonate with audiences, it has to be someone we know. It&#39;s Jar Jar, manipulating Kylo and company just as he did Anakin and Palpatine.</b><br>--------------------<br>originalginger213<br>So the title of Phantom Menace refers to Jar Jar then? He was the real menace all along?<br><br>I can get behind this.<br><br><b>Lumpawarroo<br>Yeah, Palpatine was never a &quot;Phantom&quot; from the audience&#39;s perspective. We all knew who the eventual Emperor was- they didn&#39;t even really bother to mask his hologram face.<br><br>Jar Jar was the intended villain that was to be &quot;unmasked&quot; and shock everyone, the requisite middle chapter &quot;I am your father&quot; calibre reveal moment.<br><br>Sadly, it didn&#39;t come to fruition. Not until this December, anyway.</b><br>----------------------------<br>PWNtimeJamboree<br>out of curiosity, I don&#39;t ever recall this happening, but you&#39;ve used a lot of actual evidence thus far so I feel I must legitimately question this (sigh): did Jar Jar actually tell 8 yr old Anakin that Padme was &quot;pretty hot&quot;?<br><br><b>Lumpawarroo<br>Yup. In TPM, when they initially land on Coruscant, Jar Jar and Anakin leave the landing pad in a little air speeder with the Queen and her handmaidens. When they sit down in the car, Jar Jar comments on how nice the Queen is being to them. Then he pointedly comments, &quot;Pitty hot!&quot;<br><br>To me there&#39;s no question that he&#39;s literally saying that the queen is &quot;hot,&quot; as in attractive. He&#39;s not commenting on the weather or anything. It&#39;s a completely nonsensical and inappropriate thing to say to a little kid, and is totally weird in the movie....unless you realize what is actually happening (that Jar Jar is a bad guy manipulating an impressionable Annie)<br><br>Also note that in Attack of the Clones, when they first meet up again, Anakin is forlorn and tells Jar Jar, &quot;She (Padme) has forgotten me completely.&quot;<br><br>Jar Jar is very quick to buoy his hopes, though, telling Anakin, &quot;No, no she&#39;s happy to see you, happier than I&#39;ve ever seen her!&quot;<br><br>See, Jar Jar has a vested interest in Anakin&#39;s continued lust for Padme. Because he and Palpatine have already formulated that as the easiest way to undermine Anakin&#39;s loyalty to the Jedi.<br><br>There&#39;s no telling how much Jar Jar has been deviously encouraging Anakin&#39;s infatuation in the formative years between TPM and AotC. And we must assume that he has been-- why else would Anakin immediately start talking to Jar Jar about how the queen has forgotten him? It&#39;s because Jar Jar has become his confidant/wing man in the matter.<br><br>I wouldn&#39;t doubt that it was Jar Jar, also, who eventually plants the Padme-death-by-childbirth nightmares in Anakin&#39;s dreams. Master of mind control, after all.</b><br>------------------------------<br>ChibiPatrick<br>To lend credence to this theory <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/236oks/iama_ahmed_best_actorwriterdirector_best_known/cgty74i"> here</a> is the voice actor of jar jar binks making a comment to the effect of George changed some of the story because of the backlash.<br><br><b>Lumpawarroo<br>Yeah, &quot;huge changes.&quot;<br><br>Imagine for a moment that Yoda did not reveal himself as the ultimate Jedi master until Return of the Jedi. That Yoda spent all of Empire Strikes Back wobbling along behind Luke like a pet, going &quot;Hee hee, ho ho, whooooa, can I get another yum yum snack bar, yesss?&quot;<br><br>Instead of beloved, he&#39;d have been reviled. &quot;How dare Lucas ruin Star Wars with a muppet, for chrissakes???&quot; and the whole triolgy is ruined.<br><br>His tragic mistake this time around was letting the &quot;silly facade&quot; of Mystical Alien Character percolate between episodes, and not having the courage to follow through in the face of intense (but misplaced) criticism.</b><br>---------------------------------------<br>LawOfMuphry<br>I don&#39;t know what to say other than this is amazing<br><br><b>Lumpawarroo<br>Thanks. There could have been more, but I was hitting the 15,000 character limit on the post.<br><br>I didn&#39;t even show Jar Jar using the force to predict the future:<br><br><a href="http://gfycat.com/HoarseAdventurousLadybird">Jar Jar the psychic doorman</a><br><br>... how did he know the Jedi were going to arrive precisely then and there? There was no doorbell. They didn&#39;t call ahead of time or anything- otherwise the Queen herself or her security would have been there to greet the distinguished Jedi- and besides, we know they didn&#39;t give advanced notice, because after this scene, Jar Jar has to call out to the Queen and tell her who is there. And everyone&#39;s surprised.<br><br>But not Jar Jar. He sensed them as they were coming up, just like the Jedi sense the intruder assasin bug later that evening.<br><br>Note how he slyly checks around every corner as he&#39;s walkin there, slinking about like it&#39;s only natural for him to be sneaky and stuff... but only dials up the &quot;Gee shucks I&#39;m a goofball!&quot; routine when the elevator doors open.<br><br>I&#39;m telling you, watch the prequels and keep an eye on Jar Jar when the other characters aren&#39;t looking directly at him.</b><br>------------------------<br>ankyle<br>This seems like it could have been a dissertation for film school<br><br><b>Lumpawarroo<br>Yall are just lucky there&#39;s a character limit on self-posts, otherwise you&#39;d still be reading.<br><br>I didn&#39;t even mention how it&#39;s Jar Jar that sabotages the hyperdrive on the Queen&#39;s ship, forcing them to head toward Tatooine (where Jar Jar already knows The Chosen One lives).<br><br>Notice that during their escape, Jar Jar is <a href="http://gfycat.com/WealthyUntidyAmericanbittern">busy suspiciously fiddling around in the back of the ship.</a> R2-D2 notices that this character is doing something suspicious, and gives him a well-deserved smack, and shakes its head as if to say, &quot;Uh uh, don&#39;t F with my ship, buddy.&quot; Unfortunately, R2 is forced to head elsewhere and deal with outer hull damage, allowing Jar Jar to finish his dirty work.<br><br>How wude, indeed. See, Jar Jar hates droids, and they hate Jar Jar. They are immune to his Mind Control powers and thus immediately recognize him as a foul threat. You see this throughout the movie (example: in Watto&#39;s shop, awakened Pit Droid immediately kicks Jar Jar in his Jar Jars)</b><br>--------------------<br>Orcaboros <br>So... Literally some of the first lines of The Phantom Menace, by Obi-Wan no less, are <i>&quot;I have a bad feeling about this. ... It&#39;s not about the mission master, it&#39;s about something...elsewhere. Elusive.&quot;</i> and then, after Qui-Gon tells him to focus on the here-and-now, Obi-Wan says that Yoda has told him to be mindful of the future.<br><br>So... looking forward vague foreshadowing of something dark and elusive to be found in the near future, something that Qui-Gon would overlook? Jar Jar, maybe?<br><br><b>Lumpawarroo<br>Jar Jar is probably already on the ship with them, or on one of the other Trade Federation vessels, tracking their movements. It&#39;s how he is right there to literally pounce on Qui-Gon planetside- he follows them down.<br><br>At that point in the story, his immediate goals would be:<br><br>    &gt;Somehow insert himself into the Jedi party<br>    &gt;Lead them to The Chosen One<br>    &gt;Orchestrate events so that Qui-Gon insists on training the boy<br><br>Palp/Jar Jar want the Jedi to find and adopt this new Force anomaly (Anakin) so that he can help them destroy the Jedi from within.</b><br>-------------------<br>1pt21jiggawatts 9 points 4 days ago <br><br>I just wanted to add something to your theory of Jar Jar being a master of mind manipulation.<br><br>I rewatched episode 1 last and there&#39;s a scene where Qui-gon and Obi-Wan are speaking to the head Gungan, Rugor Nass. After a few words are exchanged between Qui-gon and the king there&#39;s a quick cut to Jar Jar in cuffs. He does a little hand wave maneuver and right after that the conversation becomes more hostile.<br><br>The king pretty much kicks them all out the city after that. Just wanted to see your take on it.<br><br>I tried uploading the gif but couldn&#39;t. I&#39;ll add it later if I can get it working<br><br>    permalinkembedparent<br><br><b>Lumpawarroo <br><br><a href="http://gfycat.com/LazySpanishArthropods">Here you go,</a> I had already created a gif of that scene. Was originally going to include it, but I had to draw the line somewhere (there&#39;s just so much)<br><br>Jar Jar telepathically juggling Boss Nass like a marionette <br><br>Look at poor Boss Nass struggle ineffectually against the terrible psychic intrusion as Jar Jar just smiles to himself.... such a menace.<br><br>My take is this: Right before we see Jar Jar doing this, Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan are attempting to convince Boss Nass that they must prepare for the coming droid invasion, and warn the human Nabooians.<br><br>Jar Jar doesn&#39;t want to allow a possible gungan/human coalition to form this early (he needs to kidnap the queen and Anakin, first, before any decisive battle resolves the conflict). So he&#39;s elevating Boss Nass&#39; racism and bitterness towards humans to the point where even two experienced Jedi negotiators have no hope of leading him along the wise course.<br><br>Remember, Qui-Gon is a professional diplomat, a Jedi consular. It&#39;s like his dang job to be able to pull this kind of thing off. It should be a cake walk for him. But Jar Jar&#39;s mojo is just too strong.<br><br>Jar Jar has so stirred up Boss Nass against any concession to the Jedi that Qui-Gon (the universe&#39;s most qualified diplomat, according to the Jedi Council itself) has to feebly resort to a Mind Trick of his own just to get Boss Nass to let him borrow a used car and slink out of town.</b><br>-------------------------<br>And, finally, two images that help further the point.<br><br>Jar Jar <a href="http://i.imgur.com/geiFioR.png">has Sith eyes.</a><br><br>Hasbro <a href="http://jedibusiness.com/images/actionFigures/e2/e2_JarJarBinks_Big_2.jpg">did not get the memo</a> about the story change.</p>

            <p>That is a very well-constructed theory. It doesn&#39;t <i>quite</i> ring true for me, but damn, the prequels would have been much more interesting if they had been written like this. I especially like the parallel some commenters draw between Jar Jar and the Mule from the Foundation series. We&#39;ve already got <s>Coruscant</s> Trantor and the evil trade federation, so why not?<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Some of them only add to the theory!<br><br>Not to mention this (copied directly from a reply made by the OP:<br><br>***<br><br>I didn&#39;t even show Jar Jar using the force to predict the future:<br><br><a href="http://gfycat.com/HoarseAdventurousLadybird">Jar Jar the psychic doorman</a><br><br>... how did he know the Jedi were going to arrive precisely then and there? There was no doorbell. They didn&#39;t call ahead of time or anything- otherwise the Queen herself or her security would have been there to greet the distinguished Jedi- and besides, we know they didn&#39;t give advanced notice, because after this scene, Jar Jar has to call out to the Queen and tell her who is there. And everyone&#39;s surprised.<br><br>But not Jar Jar. He sensed them as they were coming up, just like the Jedi sense the intruder assasin bug later that evening.<br><br>Note how he slyly checks around every corner as he&#39;s walkin there, slinking about like it&#39;s only natural for him to be sneaky and stuff... but only dials up the &quot;Gee shucks I&#39;m a goofball!&quot; routine when the elevator doors open.<br><br>I&#39;m telling you, watch the prequels and keep an eye on Jar Jar when the other characters aren&#39;t looking directly at him.<br><br>***<br><br>So yeah, I&#39;m convinced. :D<br></p>

            <p>Hello! I discovered this community some time back (...about three years ago, actually), and since then I&#39;ve been following your works, which I have to admit I&#39;ve actually grown into quite a fan of! ^^; However, I&#39;ve never actually gotten around to properly joining the Board until now (partly because I&#39;ve always been slightly in awe of you guys, in a way, and felt kind of shy about coming forward like this, and partly because I simply never really found the time), so I thought, hey, why not? <br><br>So, very quick run-down, I like Lord of The Rings/The Hobbit, Doctor Who, Harry Potter and Star Wars (basically the standard fandoms), I enjoy writing and arts stuff, and I hope to be able to contribute something to the PPC community in the future (as, like I&#39;ve said before, I&#39;ve grown to like you guys quite a lot).

In addition to boosting your accuracy by one stage, 20/20 allows you to hit again for 33% damage after a successful strike, rounded up. Seaking can make pretty good use of this, so you should try it on a pure damage Physical set with Aqua Tail, Drill Run, Megahorn, and Knock Off. Normally Waterfall would be preferred here, but the fact of it is that Seaking isn&#39;t really fast enough to get a flinch off unboosted, so it&#39;s worth just going for damage.</p>

            <p>I was quite a bit of lurker before I join too, partly because, also just like you, I tendo to be rather shy. So I definitely get where you&#39;re coming from. People around here are indeed quite amazing, not only as writers, but also as friends. We are very nice and welcoming around here, so I have no doubt that soon enough you will feel that you are part of this wonderful community. <br><br>Now, for your welcoming gifts. Have a Bag of Holding, so that you have something to store in the truckload of gifts you&#39;re getting, your very own Muggle-Use Wand, and a Rorschach Book, which can change into any written text in existence. You need to close your eyes while holding it, think about the text you wanna read and then blink three times.</p>

            <p>I am typing this from an iPad right now so there maybe a few mistakes. However I&#39;ll come back on a computer and clear anything up. <br>Basically I found the PPc wiki a few years ago trying to find other badfics to read. Learning about Rose potter however I instantly wondered how bad it was and went striaght to the oringinal fanfic never knowing about the community.<br>I returned then I saw a link on gamer gazhi ( a board that started as anti gamer gate only but turned into a place to discuss games and issues) with reddit I read( I don&#39;t have a reddit account) asking others how they thought about msting fanfics. <br><br>I&#39;ve been doing nothing but reading the missions  and gathering my courage to say hello. <br> My fandoms are many and I&#39;ll put them in a comment on here when I get on a computer. I&#39;m worried I&#39;ll misspell some of them.<br>I&#39;m actually  Ausitic (PDD-HOS),ADHD,and Dlyexic  so if you ever see a stu or sue like that I&#39;ll be o so happy to help out there. <br>I don&#39;t know what else to say  right now so I&#39;ll end it here for now. <br></p>

            <p>What I mean is the Teen Titans Year One series from March<br>to August in 2008. It was a 6 issue series. Some of the pages were posted on deviantart by the colorist John Rauch. It ended  so it&#39;s not one of the regular ongoing ones that&#39;s for sure,otherwise I&#39;d be be out buying the new issues.   </p>

            <p>Is a 6 issue miniseries rebooting the original Teen Titans in the wake of the <i>Infinite Crisis</i> crossover event, the then ongoing series was the 3rd <i>Teen Titans</i> series (sorry I lumped <i>Young Justice</i> y <i>The Titans</i> ongoing series along with them, &#39;cuz they&#39;re <i>Teen Titans</i> in all but name, in fact, both continued into the above mentioned 3rd Volume after being canceled) and the current ongoing series is the 5th, which started in September, 2014.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m new to the community as well, and I too was quite the lurker before I actually plucked up the courage to come here, so I get where you&#39;re coming from (I also happen to be a fellow ADHD-sufferer, with a similar intolerance for Suethors who abuse mental illnesses, so I empathise with you on that). <br><br>I don&#39;t have much in the way of welcome gifts, but I did pick up an urple Furby the other day. I don&#39;t think it likes me, though (it keeps eyeing me really shiftily), so maybe it&#39;ll be happier off with you. Cheers!</p>

            <p>Sweet! Nice to meet a fellow newbie who hates mental illness abuse here.  <br>I should get a gift for you too. uh. Currently I only have the gifts I&#39;ve been given though. How about an IOU paper where I have to give you a free gift later? </p>

Actually Gash/Zatch Bell is my favorite one so that is always in the main fandoms. <br><br> Others include Bob&#39;s Burgers,Good Omens,Phineas and Ferb,Dude that’s my ghost,Deadpool,Teen titans,Sonic the Hedgehog,Octodad,Game Grumps,Panty and Stocking,Pokemon,Phoenix Wright,Harry Potter,and Lego. <br><br>I tend however not to be in the &quot;Center&quot; of the fandoms and gravitate to the oc parts or towards a roleplay area. </p>

            <p>I was a lurker before I joined too, so I definitely get where you&#39;re coming from. I think it is safe to infer from your post that you have read The Original Series and the relevants FAQs on the Wiki. As such, I only have this to ask: Have read the PPC Constitution? <br><br>Now, as for your welcoming gifts, here they are: A Bag of Holding, so that you have something to store in all the gifts you&#39;re about to receive, and a Rorschach Book, which can change into any written text in existence. To use it, you have to close your eyes while you&#39;re holding it, think about what you wanna read and then blink three times.</p>

            <p>Fangirls are eternal. The only way to avoid getting bashed by fangirls is to avoid reviewing badfics. The best thing to do is probably nothing; there&#39;s no reason to turn the review section into a flame war.<br>And remember: if the author reads it and learns something, it&#39;s surely worth the backlash from others who are choosing to be ignorant.

            <p>We have finished another mission and are in need of a beta. The mission is set in a <i>Star Wars</i> x <i>Star Trek</i> (the Original Series) crossover. We are looking for a SPaG/flow/holes beta. Knowledge of the stuff that already happened to Des, the Reader and the Librarian is a must. Please drop your email here so we would be able to share the GDoc with you.<br><br>Thanks!</p>

            <p>Hoom, hoom. Let&#39;s see here...<br><br>-Your writing is full of run-on sentences.<br><br>-You have created a couple of minis (Rudy&#39;s and Bei Fong, to be exact).<br><br>-Your writing is full of awkward phrasing; Richard&#39;s speech pattern is particularly grating.<br><br>-There are places where your paragraphing doesn&#39;t make sense (such as putting a line break between a speaker&#39;s actions and not between speakers).<br><br>-You mention Marina taking an M1911. From where? Out of thin air?<br><br>-It&#39;s odd for Richard to say that the PPC is basically all about Sues, especially since he&#39;s in Floaters and isn&#39;t a complete newbie.<br><br>-It&#39;s also weird for him to get training because he&#39;s from World One — agents get training if they&#39;re lucky. If not and they&#39;re lucky, they&#39;re assigned to an experienced partner. However, training is definitely not universal. Also, &quot;basic training&quot; usually means <i>military</i> boot camp and the PPC is not an army.<br><br>-You say that Marina&#39;s family is linked to the Philadelphia Mafia. The thing is that the Philly Mob is basically all but dead today; this doesn&#39;t make a lot of sense.<br><br>-Apropos the Mafia, saying that she&#39;s related to the Scarfo family is a bit weird, since the Dresdenverse is Like Reality Unless Noted and the Scarfos have a well-documented family tree; you&#39;re altering history, and it serves little purpose.<br><br>-While it&#39;s nice to see that my disclaimer style is appealing, you should have changed the formatting so it would conform with yours.<br><br>-Richard&#39;s list of favourites is a bit long, and I think it beats the point of &quot;favourites&quot;. Unless he&#39;s really not picky, and I didn&#39;t get that vibe from him.<br><br>-Marina&#39;s long list of favourites doesn&#39;t make any sense since she wasn&#39;t exposed to other universes before — how&#39;d she know about Nico Robin if she didn&#39;t watch <i>One Piece</i>?<br><br>-I don&#39;t know the Dresdenverse particularly well — I&#39;ve only read the first book — but I did ask Firemagic and she pointed the following things out:<br>--Water magic is pretty hard to use, on the account of water rejecting magic. That&#39;s jarring considering that Marina is a newbie.<br>--Making new foci in HQ isn&#39;t impossible, merely hard.<br><br>-Stuff like Richard&#39;s comment on the Flowers, the way the broken console throws up sparkles and Richard&#39;s almost-obligatory training make me think you&#39;re not quite clear on the details of how the PPC works.<br><br>So: your SPaG needs work and you need to do your research. Permission Denied.<br><br>PS: Tira and Dorano, it is expected from you as betas to catch SPaG mistakes, especially since Hardic specifically asked for SPaG betas. Not catching a few mistakes is OK — nobody&#39;s perfect — but not catching this many? This isn&#39;t quality betaing.</p>

            <p>I can see why they call it that. It was... not nearly as fun as I had hoped, though part of it was likely my fault. Way, way too cold, and my laptop is really showing its age. Plus, I was sick the whole time. I hope I don&#39;t have the flu. Colorado is way too dry for that.<br><br>I have some new pictures of the Garfield Park Conservatory, though, if anyone&#39;s interested. I&#39;d definitely recommend that part. Plus, Fatso&#39;s Last Stand. Best. Hotdog. Ever. Well, okay, it tasted awful because I was sick, but I could tell it would have tasted good if I wasn&#39;t.</p>

            <p>Not much to say in terms of commentary: this was a good mission, and good work showing off your characters&#39; reactions to the fic.<br><br>But of course, no SOH176 reply would be complete without corrections, so:<br><br>1) <i>[pokйmon trainer the mini-Missingno] laughed mockingly. “That mean I win! Mini one, pony-girl zero!”</i><br>Ami is in human disguise in this mission, yes? Then how did the mini know that Ami is a pony?<br><br>The same issue appears later: <br><i>“Fairy-boy, why you steal Mommy’s pizza?” asked sliver conference.</i><br><br>2) pokйpurse the mini-Missingno: Minis are created via misspellings of canonical names. But you&#39;ve made clear in this very mission that there&#39;s no such thing in canon as a &quot;pokйpurse&quot;. Hence there should be no mini.<br><br>3) <i>The agents were teleported to Wendi’s general area again, but thanks to a glaring word error, she entered not the tall grass at the center of the park, but the same generic forest.</i><br>What word error? I did not catch anything that would have implied that the Sue went anywhere but the National Park.<br><br>But that aside, good mission.</p>

            <p>I hadn&#39;t really thought about that aspect of mini-Missingno nicknaming people, whoopsie ^_^; I&#39;ll fix that as soon as I&#39;m able.<br><br>In regards to &quot;pokйpurse&quot;...back in my first mission, the Sue made up a move called &quot;psych-heal&quot;, which manifested as a mini. I was applying the same principle to our glitchy friend here.<br><br>Finally, the word error I talked about comes from this line before she spots a Beedrill: &quot;I was venturing deeper into the forest to look for some really good bug pokйmon.&quot; The only forest near or in National Park is the one outside its borders; the park itself is an open space with tall grass cut to look like a Pokй Ball, as I&#39;m sure you know. :)</p>
