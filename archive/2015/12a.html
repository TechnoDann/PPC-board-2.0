            <p>Or, how Matt discovers the <i>Star Wars</i> fandom, and tries his best to understand everything that&#39;s going on. I thought that if I&#39;m doing this anyway, I may as well share my first impressions and thoughts about the entire universe. One thread below per episode. I hope you guys will join me for the discussions about the episodes, and maybe some of you <i>Star Wars</i> veterans answer some question! </p>

            <p>Palpatine got himself kindnapped, huh... Yeah, as if. 99% sure he let them, or simply that was his plan.<br><br>The way those battle droids talk reminds me of Minions...<br><br>Is it just me, or after Anakin finally married Padme, his demeanor mellowed a bit? Hmh, maybe he did grow just a lil&#39; bit.<br><br>R2 is more badass than Obi-Wan and Anakin so far. Funnier, too.<br><br>Palpatine, you&#39;re not fooling anyone with your &#39;victim of kidnapping&#39; shtick.<br><br>1) I guess lightsaber instantly cauterizes wounds since there&#39;s no blood, but Count Lee just had his palms cut off... why is he not screaming?<br>2) &quot;Do it.&quot;<br><br>Wilhelm scream.<br><br>Did the writers decide for R2 to become the Jar Jar of this Episode? =___=<br><br>General <s>Ultron</s> Grevious escapes, and R2 continues to emit stupid sounds.<br><br>Padme turns from Action Girl into Housewife and that is not good.<br><br>Okay Anakin, after that story Palpatine told you, you should have SOME hints that he&#39;s a Sith. Come on, the way he talked about the Dark Side reminded me of Snape and his monologue on Dark Arts!<br><br>Those two Wookiees totally stole Tarzan&#39;s roar...<br><br>General <s>Ultron</s> Grevious turns into a spider monkey and uses Four Sabers Style... Roronoa Zoro is jealous.<br><br>Obi-Wan shares his apprentice&#39;s habit of losing lightsabers.<br><br>Wow... I kinda... agree with Palpatine there. In order to master any type of power (Magic, the Force, etc.) one should study all of its aspect, and then choose which path they should walk.<br><br>Huh, so General <s>Ultron</s> Grevious wasn&#39;t a pure droid, then... interesting.<br><br>Oh, so Count Lee can lose both his hands and be fine about it, but when Anakin cuts Samuel L. Jedi&#39;s hand now it&#39;s time to scream in pain, huh?<br><br>Ah, yes... this is the line I was waiting for... *ekhm*<br><br>UNLIMITED POOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOWEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEER!!!<br><br>Rest in Force, Samuel L. Jedi.<br><br>Dun dun dun dun du du dun du du... Enter Vader.<br><br>&#39;Execute Order 66&#39; another reference I now understand! :D<br><br>No! Not the Twi&#39;lek chick! (Hmm, first Darth Talon, now her... I think I&#39;m into Twi&#39;lek ladies)<br><br>Nobody mentions Master Qui-Gon (mayherestinpeace) this entire movie and I&#39;m not happy about that.<br><br>&quot;<i>Anakin is the father, isn&#39;t he?</i>&quot; Now he realizes...<br><br>Pregnant Padme becomes the Action Girl again. Finally.<br><br>Nope, Padme competely forgot what being an Action Girl is, she just changed costume :/ Aaaaand she&#39;s down. Lovely.<br><br>Yoda&#39;s like, &quot;Move b*tches, out of the way.&quot; I feel like this muppet could blink and the majority of the Empire&#39;s forces would be gone.<br><br>Hold on... Yoda, you countered Count Lee&#39;s lightning like it was a Roman candle; why are you having your jolly green bottom kicked by Palpatine?<br><br>That&#39;s what I&#39;m talking about! Go, Little Green!<br><br>That little worker droid sees Obi-Wan and Vader fighting and is like, &quot;Nope, I&#39;m out.&quot;<br><br>So Padme died of broken heart? Um... did that actually ever happened? Anywhere?<br><br>Ah, birth of Vader... and there&#39;s another line I was waiting for... *ekhm*<br><br>NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!<br><br>Obi-Wan and Yoda mention Master Qui-Gon (mayherestinpeace) and I&#39;m happy about it! :D<br><br>And on that happy note I will end my marathon of the prequels. Because I don&#39;t have the comparison yet, I&#39;m gonna say I enjoyed it.<i>The Phantom Menace</i> still is my favourite out of all three, followed by <i>Revenge of the Sith</i> and with the hormone-driven Anakin-centered <i>Attack of the Clones</i> in the end.<br><br>Well, I&#39;ll see you guys tomorrow with the actual trilogy, let&#39;s see what <i>A New Hope</i> will bring. </p>

            <p>&quot;<i>I guess I was wrong... There&#39;s no danger at all.</i>&quot;<br>Cue the Ironic Overpower!

Man, the Sith really are stupid.<br><br>So this happens 10 years after <i>The Phantom Menace</i>, huh? Which would make Anakin 19, and Padme 24. I&#39;m not complaining, good for you, Ani, it&#39;s just... weird seeing how she was this maternal figure to him in the first movie, and then he suddenly wants her to hop onto his lightsaber in the second.<br><br>Jar Jar is not annoying in the first moment he speaks? Something&#39;s wrong with me...<br><br>Seems like Obi-Wan wants to do everything by the book, to avoid being compared to Master Qui-Gon (mayherestinpeace), and here come Anakin&#39;s hormones to ruin his plans!<br><br>Goddamnit, R2, you were supposed to inform the Jedi if you detect <i>anything</i>! Why did you decide to ignore something your sensors pick up just because you didn&#39;t see it!?<br><br>Okay, at this speed, Obi-Wan&#39;s sleeve would be gone... and some of his skin, too.<br><br>Seriously, lady, just stop your vehicle... Physics will throw that cocky son-of-a-b off your speeder in a minute.<br><br>Okay, Mr. Bounty Hunter... I doubt you only had one toxic dart prepared, and the Jedi clearly didn&#39;t sense you when you shoot that shapeshifter. Why didn&#39;t you shoot Anakin or Obi-Wan?<br><br>It would be way cooler if Master Yoda was using the Force to hover himself in that wheelchair-y thing...<br><br>Jar Jar is not annoying in the first quarter of the movie... something&#39;s clearly wrong.<br><br>Wow, Anakin&#39;s really hormone-driven through this entire movie... I&#39;m not sure I like it.<br><br>Clone army, huh... roll credits?<br><br>Anakin and Padme are doing the Star Wars version of &#39;Netflix &amp; Chill&#39;.<br><br>Obi-Wan just Batman&#39;d Jango&#39;s ship!<br><br>Tatooine! :D<br><br>Aaand we got our first &#39;Dark Anakin&#39; moment.<br><br>Count Lee mentions Master Qui-Gon (mayherestinpeace) and I&#39;m not happy about that :c<br><br>Jar Jar Binks does something helpful. A sentence I have never expected to say.<br><br>&quot;<i>I love you.</i>&quot;<br>&quot;<i>Y-you love me?</i>&quot;<br>Yes, Ani, we were all surprised.<br><br>It&#39;s 40 minutes of the movie left; I want to see Yoda visit the cloners!<br><br>Hold on, execution scene: Padme was wearing a full-body suit, she got claws to the <i>back</i>, and suddenly she has her full midriff exposed?! <br><br>How did Samuel L.

Yoda and Obi-Wan totally saw Anakin and Padme kissing! He should&#39;ve been expelled!<br><br>I hear Darth Vader theme! A good moment to end!<br><br>Overall, I think I like <i>The Phantom Menace</i> a little bit more. It&#39;s nice to see how Anakin slowly sumbits himself into the Dark Side, and we got a follow-up on Obi-Wan. I think Episode 2 can work as both the continuation of Ep. 1, and a standalone title. Well, off to Episode 3!</p>

            <p>Well, right now I&#39;m done with Episode 1 and I think I&#39;m digging <i>Star Wars</i> already. But... well... some of you guys were right about THIS ABOMINATION<br><br><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/olnuKV0a3Et5C/giphy.gif"><br><br>Let me just say this - I didn&#39;t now it was possible to absolutely <i>dislike</i> a character after its first appearance, until I met Jar Jar Binks. As soon as he jumped on Master Qui-Gon (Hands down favourite character so far!) who clearly told him to move away... gosh, I knew he was gonna be bad. Well, he&#39;s not a terrible character... he&#39;s what he&#39;s suppose to be - a cheap comic relief, with few good moments.<br><br>On a flipside, the planet Naboo and the city (Theed, was it called?) were absolutely stunning looking! One of the better locations I&#39;ve seen in any movie ever. Vibrant, slightly exotic, and really amazing.<br><br>Hm... I knew about C-3PO and R2-D2 before, but I didn&#39;t know the former was built by Anakin and the latter was your ordinary maintenence droid.<br><br>Umm... if I understood correctly, Anakin was born out of immaculate conception? 0.0 (btw. I know what&#39;s Anakin&#39;s future, I know what&#39;s the deal with Senator Palpatine... stuff like that really in unavoidable).<br><br>Is it racist if I say all Hutts look the same?<br><br>Oh, I noticed Warwick Davis during the Pod Racing scene.<br><br>Jedi Council... I kinda disagree with Yoda about fear leading to suffering. I would quote to him the 12th Doctor&#39;s monologue from <i>Listen</i>.<br><br>Hmm.. I don&#39;t fully trust the Gungan leader... he agreed to Padme&#39;s plead too quickly.<br><br>Okay, no... Ani, a nine-year-old, flawlessly piloting a fighter? No :/ Also, no offence, kiddo. You&#39;re acting&#39;s bad.<br><br>As I thought. Rest In Force, Master Qui-Gon :C<br><br>And Naboo&#39;s free again. The end. Yep, I am definitely curious to see the next Episodes.<br><br>Also, from what I see, the Jedi Knights balance their Force abilities, and the way of the lightsabre... is there a specific &#39;section&#39;, or &#39;branch&#39; of Jedi who are devoted more with the aspect of the Force? Like, they hone their Force skills more than the swordplay? Don&#39;t answer this one, if it&#39;s explained in the next Episodes, though.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m more of a trekkie myself, but Star Wars is quite good. Especially if you like fantasy works, shiny cities, and amazing special effects. And, yes, Jar Jar should burn. Hey, I think I just figured out what one of the no-drool videos could be...</p>

            <p>To answer your last question, yes there are different types of Jedi and their balance with Force/Lightsaber skills.  This is expanded in the Expanded Universe, particularly in the Knights of the Old Republic Games.<br><br>You have the Jedi Consulars, typically they focus on Force rather than Lightsaber.  Typically the use Green Lightsaber Crystals.  I think most sources slot Qui-Gon Jinn into the Jedi Consular branch.  <br><br>Jedi Sentinels are the next group.  These are basically balanced on the Force/Combat scale.  Typically they use Yellow Crystals.  This middle branch was largely gone by the time the films rolled around.  No one quite fits that mold.<br><br>Jedi Guardians were the last group.  These were combat oriented with only minimal additional force abilities.  They typically would use Blue Lightsaber Crystals.  Obi-Wan Kenobi typically gets slotted as a Jedi Guardian.  </p>

            <p>Also, fun fact: the first time I watched Phantom Menace, I thought Anakin&#39;s former owner was actually Jabba. Anybody else mishear those two little alien dudes that way?<br><br>I don&#39;t think they ever bring up different &quot;branches&quot; of the Jedi Order in the movies. Maybe in all the expanded universe stuff I haven&#39;t encountered yet? (Which is a lot.)<br><br>As to the immaculate conception comment: Wow, I never got that detail. It doesn&#39;t make sense, though. Anakin&#39;s not the Chosen One and we all know it, so why would the film use Jesus imagery (and the midi-chlorian thing) to make him look like the Chosen One? (Unless the prophecy was actually about his fall and eventual redemption at the hands of his son...hmmm...)</p>

            <p>I know quite a lot of things actually; as I said, you can&#39;t be on the Internet and avoid them. I know the major characters (like, I won&#39;t confuse Han with Obi-Wan, etc.), and the general plot of the &#39;better&#39; series.

            <p>Thanks for the gifts and for giving me some advice on how it works. I&#39;m reading the Original Series already and I tried clicking the Constitution, but it seems to have an error when I clicked the link. <br><br>I don&#39;t know if this is how you introduce yourself here or not, so if this is not correct, I&#39;m sorry.<br><br>As I&#39;ve said, I&#39;m Rie, I take Theatre Arts and Shakespears gives me headaches, but apparently I do well with Shakespeare. I&#39;m not sure what to tell other than my fandoms, which are Lord of the Rings, The Hobbit, I don&#39;t know if there are Les Mis fan fics to be concerned about, but I&#39;m in the Les Miserables fandom as well as the Phantom of the Opera fandom, I&#39;m partly in The Hunchback of Notre Dame (There&#39;s a constant theme in my interests and sad to say, it borders more on the fantasy and historical stories. I&#39;m not the most interesting person.) I&#39;m also in the Narnia fandom, though my knowledge is not so good with it, and I think that&#39;s all I could think of saying.<br><br>If I may ask, how does one get Permission? </p>

            <p>You are aware the the PPC is is a community first and a group of sporkers second, right? You don&#39;t need to as active as you can; you can be as active as a normal person and just hang around here like everybody else. It&#39;s fun, too!<br>The bit about activity is there because the PGs want to know the people they&#39;re granting Permission to, not because there&#39;s some &quot;you must be this tall to enter&quot; arbitrary activity standard for getting Permission.</p>

            <p>As Matt said, just by making this post you&#39;ve already joined us, even if not in the sense you originally meant. Also, the main PPC stories, the ones about agents going into badfics, are called missions. Stories about other things such as general life in HQ are called interludes.

            <p>In light of Gallifrey’s return, I would like to respectfully request a position on the Continuity Council. The finale has left the canon Gallifrey vulnerable to badfic contamination once more; fanfiction involving our home planet will become all too common, and someone will have to monitor how the fandom treats it. I propose that someone to be me. I know how a fanwriter’s mind works; therefore I am reasonably confident I will be able to predict fanfiction trends regarding our home and prepare accordingly.<br><br>Thank you for your time and your consideration.<br><br>Respectfully yours,<br><br>The Aviator</p>

It is played on a hexagon-based grid of interlocking circles, using a set of twelve transparent tiles.<br><br>-Five of the tiles are triangular, covering the intersection of three circles. Four of the five tiles show the circles/portions thereof which make up the basis of Circular Gallifreyan. Each &#39;base&#39; tile has a set of holes in it (marked in red), to allow the insertion of...<br><br>-The other seven tiles, which are small and circular. Two of these show the vowel symbol (one with a line, one without); the other five show the consonant modifiers used in CG.<br><br>Play is similar to normal scrabble, but, er, harder. <sup>_^</sup> Circular tiles are not able to overlap, so there is a tactical element to their placement - should a three-dot modifier to turn a T into a R be placed on the edge of the arc, allowing the other circles using that tile to be modified separately (but only leaving space for an &#39;A&#39; vowel), or in the centre, locking all three circles to use &#39;T&#39;, but giving them freedom to choose their vowels?<br><br>According to the most common ruleset used in HQ, any circle with two or more <i>modification</i> tiles in it must form a word. A circle which is only affected by triangular tiles, or by only one modifier, can be gibberish or a partial word. (And yes, there are hardcore players who say <i>any</i> tile in a circle means it has to make a word. Of course there are.)<br><br>Since Circular Gallifreyan is a writing system, not a language, the game can be played in any tongue. Among HQ&#39;s fans of the game, it is considered to be easiest when played in either Quenya (since the written form of that tongue traditionally leaves out the sign for &#39;A&#39;, the most common vowel, and the most inconvenient one in CGS), or in the various languages which traditionally do not write their vowels. (Some, of course, consider this to be cheating.)<br><br>And did I mention it&#39;s ridiculous? Because it&#39;s <i>super</i> ridiculous.<br><br>hS</p>

I could probably run a demo game on the Other Board - probably with infinite tiles, since it&#39;s the first run. With a properly labelled-up board and pieces (and me making a new image each time someone has a turn), it should be workable. Interested?

            <p>While a fanfiction trends monitor does seem to fit well with the extant Council positions--are you sure you want to do this? It&#39;s an extra responsibility, it&#39;s driven just about all of us to drink--to the point that we&#39;ve installed a mini-bar--and we aren&#39;t all, shall we say, <i>people</i> people. Moreover, this is a good deal closer to politics than it is to piloting, and, to my knowledge, your main interest has always been in the latter. So, although I commend your initiative and respect your qualifications, I have to ask (a) if you&#39;re absolutely sure about adding this commitment, and (b) what your motivations are, as this is certainly not the only way you can make a different--assignment to the <i>Doctor Who</i> division of the DMS would likely accomplish it as well.<br><br>Also, a warning: this job is full of paperwork. <i>Full of it</i>. You may wish to take that into account.<br><br>-R</p>

            <p>I&#39;m perfectly aware of what goes on in these Council meetings, and trust me, I&#39;ve already got reason enough to drink; one more won&#39;t make a difference.<br><br>My interests?

            <p>I&#39;ve done it before and I am more than willing to do it again, should my irritation with you increase beyond a certain point. I monitored you when you were scurrying to DoSAT looking for your little penlight. You seemed rather distressed. Right now though? You only merit the most casual of dismissals. Note that your paperwork, such as it is, is unmolested. Note that everything you need arrives. The exact opposite can be true, and will be true, if you do not cease from your pathetic, antagonistic behaviour towards your fellow Time Lord. Your ire is a direct result of her decision to move away from your direct sphere of influence and into a social group where you cannot affect her. Speaking from experience with pettiness of this stripe? This is not the hill you want to die on. Take that your surrogate for a meaningful familial relationship has moved outside your control on the chin and, if you want to, figure out a way to do something about it that gets you what you want. I&#39;d like to say that you&#39;re capable of something subtle enough to get your exact desired outcome, but if I may quote from one of my colleague&#39;s favourite fandoms?<br><br>I must not tell lies.<br><br>You have lost this time, Guardsman. You don&#39;t get to have your attempt at a daughter. I look forward to your attempt to do something about it.<br><br>Do pass on my regards to the tin opener and the woman in the gimp suit.

            <p>Naya squinted at the email message. &quot;What exactly is a &#39;gimp suit&#39;?&quot;<br><br>The quarian and her partner were side-by-side at the workbench, replacing damaged circuitry in Terabyte&#39;s robotic body. The Guardsman&#39;s laser screwdriver was balanced on top a roll of duct tape and was currently projecting the contents of his email inbox on the wall. The geth, currently loaded in Naya&#39;s suit computers, briefly used her environmental suit&#39;s loudspeakers to reply. &quot;<font><font size="2">It is a form-fitting piece of clothing for use during BDSM sex acts,</font></font>&quot; it said matter-of-factly.<br><br>&quot;Oh.&quot; Naya looked down at her suit. &quot;Ick.

This sort of thing used to make me mad, but now it&#39;s... eh. It takes two to tango and I don&#39;t feel like dancing anymore. Even if she messes with our requisition forms, it&#39;s not like the PPC&#39;s grey market doesn&#39;t exist. With the added security stuff I&#39;ve slapped on my screwdriver and the DIA reforms, our gear won&#39;t suddenly be confiscated from us. We&#39;re staserproof.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I meant about Arin, you moron,&quot; said Naya impatiently. &quot;Look, okay, I get it. You&#39;re bang on the money about her issues, but you didn&#39;t need to be a tool about it.&quot;<br><br>&quot;<font><font size="2">You should apologize,</font></font>&quot; added Terabyte. &quot;<font><font size="2">It won&#39;t do to let this fester.</font></font>&quot;<br><br>&quot;No, it won&#39;t,&quot; said the Guardsman wearily, setting down his tweezers and examining his handiwork with a magnifying glass and a flashlight. &quot;But I think I&#39;m gonna step back from this for a few hours and come back with a clear head. I don&#39;t want to say anything that could worsen the situation.&quot; He put away the magnifying glass and picked up a multimeter. &quot;Might go to Rudi&#39;s. I promised Lord Wymbourne and Commander McCandless a beer for their help earlier today.&quot;<br><br>&quot;So long as you&#39;re gonna do something about it...&quot; said Naya, turning back to her work.<br></p>

Yes, Gallifrey is back and it looks amazing. Yes, we got to learn a bit more about the Matrix and how it works. Yes, a biological-sex-switching regeneration is something I&#39;ve been waiting for (and been hideously jealous of) for a damned long time. But Hell Bent SUUUUUUUUCKED. And you know why it sucked?<br><br>Because all the good stuff, all the stuff Steven Moffat put in that I really did genuinely like, all the excitement I had after Heaven Sent...<br><br>It&#39;s all in service to CLARA. BLOODY. OSWALD.<br><br>Let me make one thing clear: I <i>loathe</i> this character, but I never used to. I liked Clara at first. I thought the Impossible Girl stuff was kind of interesting, though hideously overwrought by the end. But we said goodbye already this season, when she faced the raven, and it was poignant and touching and a really good end for the character because, well, she snapped and she got herself killed. It&#39;s pretty rare that we see a companion die on screen, and the fact that the Doctor was powerless to help her from a few feet away, well, it was good television.<br><br>And then along comes Hell Bent and makes it all totally superfluous because she&#39;s off in a flying Fifties themed restaurant with The One And Only Me and the Doctor pulled a gun and shot someone in the chest because of her. The Doctor broke every rule he had because of her. The Hybrid arc has gone the way of the Great Intelligence (hey, remember him?) because of her. Because everything, <i>everything</i>, has to be about Clara bloody Oswald and I&#39;m sick of her. Sick to the back teeth.<br><br>Canon Sue I name thee.

They promised us Gallifrey. They promised us Time Lords.<br><br>Instead we got Clara.<br><br>Now, I actually kind-of sort-of liked Clara. I loved her when she was introduced, but as time went on, she became kind of &#39;meh&#39; for me, just an okay character who was starting to overstay her welcome, so to speak. I raged over her in &quot;Dark Water&quot; and &quot;Death in Heaven&quot;, but for the majority of Series 9 she was actually starting to get some halfway decent character development, so she started to grow on me once more. When &quot;Face the Raven&quot; came along, I was genuinely sad and actually cried to see her go, because it felt like the perfect send-off for her, storywise. She&#39;d been becoming more and more like the Doctor as time goes on, and it finally caught up to her. Her death was brutal, and it was heartbreaking, and it was sad.<br><br>So of course Moffat had to make the grand finale about his Creator&#39;s Pet. *siiigh* And not only that, but he had to recycle Donna&#39;s send-off because... why? The Doctor still remembers Clara (in a way), Clara remembers him, and time still hasn&#39;t torn itself apart because they remember each other. Why couldn&#39;t they have simply said farewell to each other?<br><br>And, well, Clara&#39;s being horribly irresponsible gallivanting around the universe like she is. Accidents can happen; what if something happens to her before she can return to Gallifrey and be put back to the time of her death? You can kiss the universe good-bye. (Ignore the fact that we see she does, in face, die in FtR, this is merely a hypothetical pointing this out. Plus, as the Doctor likes to say, time can be rewritten.)<br><br>The first fifteen minutes or so I adored the first time &#39;round, and then kind of broke a little bit when I realized the Doctor&#39;s actions were all done for <i>Clara</i>. He didn&#39;t banish Rassilon and the High Council because of their war crimes; he banished them because they would get in his way of getting Clara back. Ugh. Just... ugh.<br><br>Rassilon: Tries to destroy time. Gets banished.<br>The General: Tries to keep the Doctor from destroying time. Gets shot in the face.<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/4rqHqjr.png" alt="http://i.imgur.com/4rqHqjr.png"> </p>

I didn&#39;t like how she was saved from the white glowing thing, but I don&#39;t expect to like everything.<br>I liked her in series 8, because she had a reason to be more in the spotlight - the Doctor was being kind of a twit.

Then the first part (on Gallifrey) started, and it was fantastic! The Woman (AKA Doctor&#39;s mum. She was also in <i>The End of Time</i> but played by a different actress), the General basically f-bombing Lord President, Rassilon (wow, the millenia weren&#39;t graceful for him), the Prioress from Karn! That was bloody brilliant!<br><br>And then... the Extraction Chamber scene happened, and the Doctor basically said &#39;Clara &gt; All Reality&#39;. That was bad. She had a good finish in FtR, and a cameo in <i>Heaven Sent</i>. Her story should&#39;ve been completely over. Instead, she becomes immortal and goes off doing some completely-not-hinted-to-return things with The One And Only Me (whom I also find unnecessary, and only liked her two &#39;versions&#39;: Ashildr and The Last Woman in the Universe).<br><br>So, yeah, the good part - Gallifrey returns, Rassilon is banished (with a possibility of returning as a future villain. Maybe a team-up with Missy and the Daleks? Again...), and the Doctor finally let Clara go.<br><br>The bad part - the entire plot is again revolving around Clara. Also, the Doctor gets not-so-completely Donna Noble&#39;d. <br><br><br><br>Btw. do you guys think that is was Ashildr/Me knock-knock-knocking on TARDIS&#39;s door in <i>Listen</i>?</p>

I think she had a rough first half-season, with the Impossible Girl arc being badly handled, but after that she turned into a character I think did something new, with her job and such. (I am curious to know why <i>you</i> dislike her so much; I don&#39;t think you actually said.)<br><br>And then... you say &#39;she snapped&#39; in <i>Face the Raven</i>, but she&#39;s been snapping all season: it&#39;s been all about how she&#39;s becoming more like the Doctor, but without the Doctor&#39;s experience of... being the Doctor. (Come to think of it, her first reaction after Danny Pink died was to a) steal the TARDIS and b) claim to be the Doctor. Woman has issues.) It was always going to lead to Something Bad - the Raven just happened to be the lucky one.<br><br>The Doctor didn&#39;t have his latest meltdown because he lost <i>Clara</i> - he had it because he lost <i>anyone</i>. He does that. Adric&#39;s name was the last thing Five ever said. Five, Nine, and Ten all died because they sacrificed their own lives to save someone else&#39;s.<br><br>Nor did he break &#39;every rule he had&#39;. He shot someone, yes, and that <i>did</i> feel shoved in just for the regeneration (seriously, Doc, just <i>hit</i> him again) - but come to think of it, the other three people he&#39;s pointed guns at were the Master and Rassilon (<i>The End of Time</i>) and Missy (<i>Death in Heaven</i>); he clearly has less problems with shooting Time Lords than other people. Beyond that... he meddled in time to rescue someone. He broke into somewhere and stole a TARDIS. He tried to wipe someone&#39;s memory against their will. And, ultimately, he showed that he was willing to sacrifice his <i>own</i> memory - as in, &#39;a man is the sum of his memories, a Time Lord even more so&#39; - for his companion.<br><br>The Doctor did what he has always done: he broke the rules to save a friend, and was willing to pay the price.<br><br>hS<br><br>PS: In fairness, the two things I think <i>shouldn&#39;t</i> have been in there:<br><br>-The Doctor shoots the General. Still not sure why this happened, other than they wanted to change the actor.<br>-The Doctor claims that taking Clara away from Gallifrey will restart her metabolism. What was wrong with &#39;you&#39;re basically in stasis, so we&#39;ll have time to sort you out&#39;? (Also, the Quantum Shade was built up last time as being able to catch her anywhere in time and space, so... how would that <i>help</i>?)<br><br>hS</p>

I actually enjoyed her run ever since the Impossible Girl arc. Like Scape, I think the main plot of <i>Hell Bent</i> - &#39;Screw Gallifrey, Save Clara&#39; - was unnecessary. She had a good ending in <i>Face the Raven</i> and even if the memory of her in <i>Heaven Sent</i> was in the Doctor&#39;s psyche, this memory (something like River for 11th) could be a good &#39;finale companion&#39; without the actual Clara Prime appearing.<br><br>Although I don&#39;t like the fact that the Doctor shot the General...

            <p>Because they are specialized in certain rare fandoms that do not have their special divisions yet, but those fandoms contained various types of badfics? (Mary Sue, Bad Slash, Implausible Crossovers, etc. )<br><br>Yeh, I saw on the Wiki page that agents in the Department Of Floaters can be those who kill badfics in canons that are not covered by regular agents, so maybe agents that are specialized in rare fandoms can become a Floater.<br><br>However, somewhere on the Board, I remember about a Permission Giver saying that Floater agents do not specialize in anything, and deal with missions of all continuums and types.......<br><br>I am quite confused about it.

            <p>But agents in that department only deal with ONE fandom. What if an agent is specialized in more than one rare continuums, but do not want to limit him/herself to any single one of them? Will Floaters be appropriate under such a condition? </p>

Y&#39;see, there&#39;s this thing called <a href="http://www.starwarsringtheory.com/">ring composition</a>, which really only works if you start at the beginning.<br>And, really, the prequels aren&#39;t as bad as fandom makes them out to be. Especially with the Jar Jar theory to watch them for.</p>

            <p>It&#39;s a suggested watching order from a Star Wars superfan. Most fans will tell you to only watch the original trilogy, or if you must watch the prequels, watch them afterwards, and then go back to the first three to cleanse your pallet. However, like them or not, the prequels do have an impact on the story now, a rather important impact. So, the man on the internet known as Machete decided on this order:<br><br>IV, V, II, III, VI<br><br>He gives a very in-depth, nerdy reason to watch in this order, which you can read <a href="http://www.nomachetejuggling.com/2011/11/11/the-star-wars-saga-suggested-viewing-order/">here.</a> However, if you don&#39;t want to read the full dissection on why this order gives depth and importance to an otherwise bland-at-best prequel trilogy, then here are the reasons he gives to <i>not</i> watch in episode or release order:<br><br>&quot;The problem with Episode Order is that it ruins the surprise that Vader is Luke&#39;s father. If you think that this reveal doesn&#39;t matter since it&#39;s common knowledge, I suggest you watch the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHSAD1d-Mdk">looks on these kids&#39; faces.</a> This reveal is one of the most shocking in film history, and if a newcomer to the series has managed to avoid having it spoiled for them, watching the films in Episode Order would be like watching the ending of The Sixth Sense first.<br><br>&quot;The other problem with Episode Order is that the prequels don&#39;t really have a story. They&#39;re just background for the real story, which is Luke&#39;s attempt to destroy the Empire and save his father. Watching 3 films of backstory is boring if you&#39;ve never seen the films they&#39;re the background to. Hell, that&#39;s why George Lucas made Star Wars (later renamed A New Hope) first - it was the most interesting story he had in his brain at the time. Starting someone off with Episode I is a surefire way to ensure they don&#39;t make it through the entire franchise.<br><br>&quot;Unfortunately, Release Order is also an instant failure, and the reason is a single shot. If you&#39;re watching the official releases and you view the original trilogy first, then after the Empire is destroyed and everyone is celebrating, Luke looks over at his mentors, Ben Kenobi and Yoda, and suddenly they are joined by... some random creepy looking teenager who needs a haircut. Placing Hayden Christensen in the ending of Jedi, since he&#39;s not in ANY of the other films, turns an ending that should be celebratory into one that is confusing for the viewer. The fact that Christensen looks like he&#39;s undressing someone with his eyes doesn&#39;t help.&quot;<br><br></p>

            <p>As for where to start: Episode IV. Watch them in the order they came out like everyone else did. At least for your first time. After that you can pretend the prequels didn&#39;t happen.</p>

            <p>As in, if other methods of chatting fail for some reason, we&#39;ll at least have the IRC. This is, admittedly, a pretty weak reason, so I wouldn&#39;t consider it a loss if we got rid of it.

            <p>I&#39;ve been wondering about this for a while: what do all of you think about the movies made from your favorite books? I wasn&#39;t a Boarder when the <i>Lord of the Rings</i> or <i>Hobbit</i> movies were made, so I&#39;m chiefly interested in them, but this also extends to HP and all other adapted continua. <br><br>Personally, I like the Middle-earth movies, although I&#39;m much more fond of the LotR films than the Hobbit ones. They&#39;re well made and entertaining, but they&#39;ve got flaws. A friend of mine encapsulated my feelings by saying that nothing about the movies <i>increases</i> the majesty of the original story or characters: they all either diminish or stay roughly the same. That&#39;s my biggest qualm. And Frodo telling Sam to go back. <br><br>No. <br><br>Just no. <br><br>So, what&#39;re the thoughts of the PPC on this topic? <br><br>-Alleb</p>

            <p>Because my favourite books are probably A Song of Ice and Fire. And Game of Thrones started so well.<br>Then they changed Asha. And destroyed Robb Stark&#39;s parallel with his father.

            <p>On one hand, it could seem fairly ridiculous, on the other hand, I saw someone develop proofs of this theory, and I must admit that the arguments used make sense.

Honestly, I have never read her infamous &#39;Draco Trilogy&#39; and I&#39;ve seen this movie first. It interested me enough to read the books, and I sincirely enjoy the world Clare has created. It&#39;s not the best world I&#39;ve ever seen, but definitely interesting and original one. Now, about the movie itself...<br><br>It&#39;s mediocre. It is not very good, simply because the first book is not very good. I realize it may contradict my previous statement but yes - <i>The City of Bones</i> is probably the worst opening book of any series I&#39;ve ever read. Well, with a TV show hitting ABC Family (or, &quot;Freeform&quot;) early January, I&#39;ve decided to re-watch the adaptation from 2013.<br><br>The effects, the scenery, and the visuals - all of those deserve a praise. Especially nicely done were scenes in the Silent City, and at Magnus Bane&#39;s party. The casting works... for the most part. Godfrey Gao makes a spectacular Magnus Bane, Robert Sheehan is an adorkable Simon Lewis, and I will always praise Jemima West&#39;s Isabelle Lightwood (<s>I would let that leather-clad huntress take her whip and...</s> Umm... you didn&#39;t see that!). Unfortunately, there are some miscasts: Kevin Zegers seems too old to be playing Alec Lightwood, and Aidan Turner doesn&#39;t exactly struck me as Luke Garroway. <br><br>Now, what doesn&#39;t really work is the acting. While the lines themselves were really nice (&quot;<i>Downgraded from a gingerbread house to a one bedroom?</i><br>Overall, I&#39;d give <i>The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones</i> 3 out of 5 starts.</p>

            <p>Okay, please ignore the last two lines and let&#39;s continue from here:<br><br>Now, what doesn&#39;t really work is the acting. While the lines themselves sometimes can make you giggle (<i>&quot;Downgraded from a gingerbread house to a one bedroom?&quot;</i>), I feel like Jamie Bower&#39;s Jace has been Shyamalized and his acting completely taken away. The plot... well, it follows the original book, so it&#39;s not really good. My general impression of it was, &quot;Screw the end of the world, and all the demons - we&#39;ve got an awkward teen drama going on here!&quot;, but after I went through Book One (and it went much smoother, because of certain spoiler), the next ones were a bit more enjoyable.<br><br>Overall, I would rate <i>The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones</i> 3 out of 5 stars.</p>

            <p>I can understand why other people might not, but I for one actually found them to be quite decent. I do think that there was quite a lot of wasted potential with regards to the storyline and character development, and I dislike the way quite a few of the scenes were executed (especially in BOTFA), but otherwise I didn&#39;t particularly mind a lot of the things which most people have been complaining about (or, at the very least, I could sort of understand the reasoning behind some of the film decisions that were made)? Maybe I&#39;m just overly lenient when it comes to film adaptations, I dunno.</p>

            <p>But the movies made from my favorite books? If we&#39;re going by favorite (and stuff I&#39;ve actually seen), then that&#39;d have to be the <i>Discworld</i> made-for-TV Sky One movies.

They ran the gamut from &quot;not bad, I suppose&quot; to &quot;yeesh, what the hell was that?&quot; Some of the details have faded from my memory (it&#39;s been a while since I&#39;ve seen them), but here&#39;s what I can recall.<br><br>Starting with the best first: <i>Hogfather</i>. Given how convoluted and meta the <i>Discworld</i> books can be, I thought this adaptation was pretty solid. Most of the major scenes were touched upon in some way or another, as best as I can recall. The biggest cuts came in regards to the little gods/personifications that kept popping up. The Oh God of Hangovers was there, but a number of others were not. Some of the stuff with the bandits in the Tooth Fairy&#39;s castle was also condensed/altered. Sidney the wizard was the one scared of the Scissor Man, for example.<br><br>The casting was solid, with Teatime being particularly creepy. My only complaint in that regard would be that Susan occasionally came across as too stolid sometimes. Particularly in scenes dealing with Death himself.<br><br>Notable scene(s): Pretty much anything with Alfred. He had some good reactions to the stuff Death was doing. I also liked the running gag with his trying to make a roll-up.<br><br>Right in the middle was <i>The Color of Magic</i> (which technically included <i>The Light Fantastic</i> as well). This one was... I guess weird would be the best way to describe it. The casting was particularly odd. The same guy who played Alfred in <i>Hogfather</i> was Rincewind, which totally clashed considering how relatively young Rincewind is supposed to be. Twoflower was played by Sean Astin, which was just... I mean, he did a damn good job, but come on! Apparently the director chose to satirize American rather than Asian tourists. <br><br>To the adaptation&#39;s credit, it managed to wrangle the convoluted plotlines of the first two books fairly well. Quite a bit of stuff was cut, such as the Temple of Bel-Shamharoth and the nymphs. The adaptation also explains away why Twoflower seemed to gain such a grasp over Morporkian so quickly despite the big hullaballo there was over his not initially being able to speak it. I love Terry Pratchett, but <i>The Color of Magic</i> (the book) does not exactly hold up. That being said, Astin!Twoflower lacks the sense of gentility and forgiveness that I remember Book!Twoflower having. There&#39;s a big scene in the adaptation where he and Rincewind have a falling out.<br><br>Notable scene(s): Almost any bit with Sean Astin. Good actor, extremely weird choice.<br><br>At the bottom of the barrel, we have <i>Going Postal</i>. This was especially galling for me as I love the first two Moist von Lipwig books (haven&#39;t read the last one). There&#39;s just so much wrong with this adaptation. The casting is mostly bad, with Moist and Adora feeling out of character at multiple points. Moist in particular lacked the charm and wit I associated with his book portrayal. The best casting decision was having Charles Dance as Lord Vetinari. Bit weird having a blond Vetinari given all the art I&#39;ve seen, but <i>damn</i> Dance caught the essence of the character.<br><br>The plot was also shredded to hell and back. Angua&#39;s one appearance outed her as a werewolf almost immediately. The Post Office for some reason was less interested in getting the mail delivered and more with trying to redeem Moist by showing him his crimes. The confrontations between Moist and Reacher Gilt were expanded upon, for the worst. The ending is wildly changed and includes Moist being outed as a conman (thus sinking part of the plot for <i>Making Money</i>). Oh, and get this: Moist&#39;s getting Adora fired caused her to start smoking.<br><br>Oy vey.<br><br>Finally, I know this was a made-for-television production (and thus had a limited budget), but the golems were just hideous.<br><br>Notable scene(s): Anthing with Charles Dance. Also, Terry Pratchett&#39;s cameo as a postman.</p>

            <p>While <i>The Lightning Thief</i> was pretty horrible, but... Mark Guggenheim (the guy behind <i>Flash</i> and <i>Arrow</i>) wrote the script for the second movie, and I don&#39;t think it&#39;s that bad. And, really, it&#39;s an adaptation - things are bound to be different.<br><br>Things I think the second movie got pretty nice:<br><br>- The opening scene with young Thalia, Luke, and Annabeth.<br>- Stanley Tucci&#39;s Dionysus.<br>- I like this version of Camp Half-Blood<br>- They made Annabeth blonde<br>- Leven Rambin&#39;s Clarisse.<br>- Nathan Filion&#39;s Hermes.<br>- The Grey Sisters.<br>- Siren Cafe. That&#39;s was pretty cool idea, although they&#39;ve had a Hundred-Handed One working there :/<br>- The ending scene with Thalia was nicely done.<br><br>Things that made me cringe:<br><br>- They screwed up the Great Prophecy; I can get behind the cast being older, but what&#39;s with this Riptide-the-Cused-Blade BS?<br>- No Madam C.C&#39;s Spa and Resport (no Reyna and Hylla foreshadow... NO BLACKBEARD!)<br>- We&#39;ve got a Hydra in the first one (which should be in second), a Manticore in the second (which should be in third), if a third one ever comes out, will it have Kampe in it?!<br>- What&#39;s with that magical deus ex vanishing tape?<br>- Zoe Aggeliki&#39;s Silena Beauregard is already a part of Kronos&#39; force. So is Ethan Nakamura.<br><br>And yeah, I know what you were waiting for...<br><br>- KRONOS. RISES! HE F***ING RISES FOR A MOMENT! NO! JUST NO! </p>

            <p>...But not as adaptations. They screwed up too much for that. I usually enjoy movies whether or not they are well adapted, not even as guilty pleasures, but I&#39;m judging &#39;The Lightning Thief&#39; as an adaptation. So, no, your fan license doesn&#39;t get revoked. I actually hate it when people are only willing to judge adaptations by the source material, as it seems like willful ignorance. After all, if it&#39;s the best movie ever made, but the worst adaptation ever made...<br><br>On the other hand, if it really is just a bad movie, then that&#39;s exactly how I&#39;ll judge it.

I love Fallout 4, but I still gave it a 6 out of 10.<br><br>Have you ever considered becoming an adaptation critic? As in, a blog or something. I think you&#39;d be good at it. Good writing style for it. And, the market is in desperate need of non-snobby fans.</p>

            <p>In <i>The Lightning Thief</i>, Ares placed a curse on Riptide so that it would fail Percy in his hour of need, so it... kiiind of fits? Percy certainly thought that Riptide could have been the blade of the prophecy, so I guess that one can slide.</p>

            <p>If there was an indication that Riptide is cursed in the first movie, I guess it would kinda work. Or, maybe if Ares actually had a part in the first one. But no, we&#39;re having the Big Bad Guy almost reforming himself at the end of the movie, quickly let&#39;s throw a deus-ex-weapon to defeat him!<br><br>I get it that the future of the franchise was under a question mark - the first one got mixed reviews, so did the second, and there was no official confirmation or denial for sequels until 2015, when Logan said that <i>The Titan&#39;s Curse</i> movie won&#39;t happen. <br><br>For someone who hadn&#39;t read the books, the movie will be nicely done as it has a solid conclusion, with a possibility of a sequel.

            <p>My two favourite non-<i>Firefly/Serenity</i> Filion moments are his scene as Hermes (&quot;And so, of course -- cancelled&quot;) in <i>Sea of Monsters</i>, and the scene in <i>Castle</i> where he... no, I&#39;m just going to have to link it.<br><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0g42UxfB6MI">Castle tries on his hallowe&#39;en costume.</a><br><br><i>&quot;Okay, a) there are no cows in space, and b) you wore that like, five years ago, don&#39;t you think you should move on?&quot;</i><br><br>-- but squeeing over Nathan Filion isn&#39;t why I&#39;m here, actually.<br><br>So, <i>Sea of Monsters</i>. The reason they did the ending and the prophecy the way they did is, I&#39;m pretty sure, because they were sure they weren&#39;t going to get another sequel. <i>Sea of Monsters</i> (the book) ends with Kronos as a sequel hook; there&#39;s no sense of the story being resolved.

            <p>Speaking as someone who genuinely enjoys the Inheritance Cycle books, the <i>Eragon</i> movie is, well, complete and utter fecal matter.<br><br>-Angela&#39;s role is diminished and bastardized. Angela was a cool, mysterious character and her companion Solembum is crucial to the plot. The movies just made Angela &quot;hey, random fortuneteller&quot; and removed Solembum completely.<br>-Arya being royalty is actually a really effing big deal, and it&#39;s not revealed until <i>Eldest</i>. And she <i>never</i> describes herself as a princess.<br>-They removed Elva. Elva is, like Angela and Solembum, very very important to the development of the rest of the cast.<br>-The Urgals are all wrong. In the film they&#39;re generic foreign savage types. In the books, they&#39;re roughly equivalent to orcs... and they&#39;ve got a culture.<br>-No Isidar Mithrim. You&#39;d think a movie, which tends to love big flashy effects, would make a big deal out of a <i>giant red rose made of sapphire</i>, but I didn&#39;t get the satisfaction of seeing it.<br>-The reveal of Brom being a Rider is supposed to be at his <i>death</i>, because it makes his secrecy make sense in hindsight to Eragon.<br>-The Ra&#39;zac. My god. The freaking Ra&#39;zac. These things were my favorite part of the series, and they were absolutely <i>mangled</i> in the adaptation. In the movie, they&#39;re just worms that walk that hunt the heroes. In the books, they&#39;re these freaky Lovecraftian horrors that metamorphose into dragon-sized bats (which were ALSO butchered by this movie) that are specifically evolved to be human predators. In the film, they were changed from the enigmatic menaces that saved the books (to me) to black-cloaked minions even more generic than the Nazgul.<br><br>Just... eff this movie. The only redeeming quality was the cuteness of baby Saphira.</p>

            <p>When I was in graduate school, I was often too busy studying to do any significant reading on major novels and such, so my appreciation of the written word was kind of a mixed bag. When I wasn&#39;t studying, though, I was able to find the time to familiarize myself with at least some of my favorite works of literature, such as all seven Harry Potter novels, the original Percy Jackson series, the Hunger Games trilogy, the Warriors series, and unfortunately (thanks to my mom) the Twilight saga. At the same time, though, I missed out on a few other works as well; I still have yet to read the LoTR series in its entirety even though I know the general idea behind most of it, along with the Hobbit novel preceding it - and don&#39;t get me started on Animorphs (which I&#39;ve only read one or two books of), the Guardians of Ga&#39;Hoole (I&#39;ve only read up to the first three or four books), and the Maze Runner series (which I haven&#39;t even touched despite seeing both of the movies currently released).<br><br>In light of this, my judgement on how good The Movie is depends on whether or not I know the original source material. If I do, I determine the worth of The Movie depending on whether it&#39;s a good adaptation first and foremost, and if I don&#39;t, I judge The Movie without reference to the source, unless The Movie is so different from the original subject matter that it could be considered its own story.<br><br>This is why I believe that if you play your cards right, The Movie can sometimes be at least as good as The Book, if not better. I believe that there are two key factors: being a good experience for people who don&#39;t have the time to read the original source, which movies are generally good at, and attempting to stay faithful to the source itself, which movies are BAD at. Two ways to settle both issues is to make The Movie a work of its own (like the HTTYD movie or The Princess and the Frog as Ix mentioned), and to faithfully adapt every single detail from the source, which is tricky due to the time and budget constraints of most movies but CAN be done (The Twilight saga is sadly one of the rare few that has mostly succeeded in this respect AFAIK). If you try to do both at the same time, the different demands of moviegoers and book fans mean you have to make compromises which can only lead to failure. This isn&#39;t limited to adaptations of written works, either - there&#39;s a reason <i>The Last Airbender</i> is never brought up within the AtLA fandom, for example.<br><br>That being said, I will concede that this isn&#39;t necessarily a hard and fast rule, and that sometimes The Movie can still be awesome even if it botches the original book, show, or whatever it&#39;s based on. Case in point? <i>Jurassic Park</i>. The first JP film specifically was a <i>horrible</i> adaptation of the original novel, taking out much of the science that made the book such a bestseller and making everybody OOC to the point where you can say Spielberg was practically godmodding. But the film nevertheless became a blockbuster because a) the movie itself had solid writing, pacing, and character dynamics, b) some of the changes actually made the story better instead of worse, and c) the dinosaurs look <i>awesome</i>. I can say with confidence that I love both the first JP movie and the original novel equally, which is something I can say for very few Movies and Sources in general.<br><br>JP is, unfortunately, a bit of an exception to the general rule, but while it shouldn&#39;t be taken as the exception that PROVES the rule, it&#39;s a good guide to how a Movie can take the original source and IMPROVE upon it rather than tarnishing it. Alas, such a phenomenon has always been extremely rare in Hollywood history, and with the drive towards experience in movies today, we&#39;ll probably never see anything even close to it for a long time. And that&#39;s terrible.</p>

            <p>I was fairly impressed with the first one, because they had gone for a faithful adaptation, even adding some scenes, and it worked for me. I really liked this movie.<br><br>However, they took a 180 with Prince Caspian, because of the form of the narration I guess, and the scenes they added were meh for me, as Peter descent to a Jerkass, or this scene with Jadis.<br><br>I didn&#39;t try to see the third one though, would it be worth it?</p>

            <p>To be honest the most recent movie made off a book I&#39;ve read was the Great Gatsby.

            <p>My favorite of the <i>Harry Potter</i> movies would have to be the first two because I felt they were most faithful to the books. Which would have to be why <i>Prisoner of Azkaban</i> is my least favorite of the movies. So much of the Marauders got cut in favor of that <i>stupid</i> shrunken head—<br><br>Sorry, I should stop now before I start ranting. &gt;:U<br><br>Oddly enough, movies that don&#39;t follow the books in anything <i>but</i> name can be pretty awesome stories in their own right. See <i>How to Train Your Dragon</i> and <i>The Frog Princess</i>; literally the only thing that was the same about <i>The Frog Princess</i> was the title. I loved those books as a kid and initially refused to see the movie because it looked like they&#39;d butchered everything, but the movie was unrecognizable from the book and therefore I had no beloved characters to get mad over. (And I actually adore the movie as it is, so bonus points!)<br><br>Tl;dr, either be faithful to the books or make it completely unrecognizable. :P</p>

            <p>But then again, I&#39;m much more forgiving of an &quot;unfaithful&quot; adaptation if we get a decent movie out of it,and we got it directed by ALPHONSO CUARON. Who is a GOD.

            <p>(I haven&#39;t watched the Hobbit movies after seeing a couple things about them on-Board.)<br><br>Basically, as movies — standalone works of art — the LotR trilogy, or, at the very least, the extended three-hours-each edition, is pretty good. I don&#39;t have a lot of complaints. As adaptations, however... there are various integral things that get left out or get changed (such as Anduril being such a big deal).

            <p>I agree with Des that the LotR movies are pretty good as movies, and I feel much more kindly disposed toward them since the <i>Hobbit</i> films showed us how bad they could have been.<br><br>Even back in the day, I was pretty happy with <i>Fellowship</i>. Yeah, Arwen stole Glorfindel&#39;s horse and Saruman beat up Gandalf, and those things were bizarre, but apart from them, it was pretty faithful to the book. Plus, come on, the casting, the scenery, the music, the costumes...! We went to Middle-earth, guys. {= D<br><br>I don&#39;t mind that Tom Bombadil was cut, either. He&#39;s always cut. I personally like him just fine, but really the only reason for that whole sequence is for the hobbits to get shiny Nъmenorean daggers from the Barrow-downs without being et by Wights, and Aragorn giving them the daggers instead makes sense enough. It&#39;s arguably worse that Fredegar Bolger and the diversionary house in Crickhollow are cut, since his actions have ramifications for the Shire at large, but nobody complains about that.<br><br>That was originally going to be a parenthetical aside. It kinda got away from me. &gt;.&gt;<br><br>Anyway, it was the second film that really irritated me. It makes Treebeard look stupid. It makes Aragorn make out with a horse. It kills off Haldir and a host of Lуrien Elves at Helm&#39;s Deep for no good reason. It makes Frodo look sneaky and Faramir look like a jerk for rightly not trusting him. It makes Gollum into an uncomfortable parody of DID. It makes Gimli into daft comic relief. It just makes me want to claw my eyes out with shame and rage on behalf of my beloved characters.<br><br>The third film is better, but by then, the damage was done. I no longer trusted Peter Jackson, so I couldn&#39;t just relax and enjoy. Plus, although the third film may have fewer sins than the second, the ones it has are pretty big. The biggest is, as Alleb mentioned, that Frodo tells Sam to go home. Just. What. I cried. I literally cried in the theater, it&#39;s so stupid and OOC. D X{ And it&#39;s the third film that gave us CGI!Legolas Oliphaunt-surfing and Flaming Denethor, too. And Elrond turns up with Andъril for some reason, denying us Halbarad and the Dъnedain. Okay, so it would&#39;ve been tricky to introduce this faction and a new named character so late in the game, but if anything, he should have just sent his sons rather than go himself, and we would&#39;ve at least gotten Elladan and Elrohir (who are Rangers), and they could&#39;ve been set up back in Rivendell or in flashbacks if we had to have those...<br><br>Ahem. I&#39;m rambling again. Sorry.<br><br>On the other hand, Pippin lighting the beacons to alert Rohan to Gondor&#39;s need is a non-canon scene that I think is pretty cool. So there&#39;s that, I guess.<br><br>In a nutshell, I don&#39;t mind most cuts and changes that necessarily result from the adaptation process itself—going from a verbal to an audio/visual story-telling medium, time limits, Hollywood three-act structure and other conventions, etc.—but I strongly object to most things that are changed or added just because the director or whoever felt like it. Most of the sins I mention above fall into the latter two categories.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Specifically, this line: <i>I strongly object to most things that are changed or added just because the director or whoever felt like it.</i> As someone who has danced between writing and filmmaking, I wanted to say a few words in defense of this practice.<br><br>Telling a director or screenwriter that they can&#39;t add any touches of their own is unfair to them. They&#39;re creative folks too, with their own stylistic choices and methods. They&#39;re not just machines that take in stories and pump out film. Think of it like this: they&#39;re being given the chance to work on a (very likely) popular franchise. Maybe it&#39;s even something they&#39;re fans of. Why deny them the chance to help shape it at least a little bit?<br><br>That said, I will acknowledge that directors and screenwriters can go to far with changes. If the end result is something that upsets both fans of the original source material and newcomers, then the blame is well deserved. Adaptational changes should make sense when viewed through both the canon and the process of adaptation itself.<br><br>I can&#39;t speak too much as to LotR itself. I think it&#39;s fairly well known on this board that I&#39;m not a fan of Tolkien&#39;s work. I thought the movies were fine as big high fantasy epics. I will say is that quite a a number of the changes you mentioned that bothered you, I can see being justified in some way. Not all, but a few of them.</p>

            <p>Disclaimer: I&#39;m about to be somewhat strident in tone. This is more because I&#39;m confused than because I&#39;m angry, and in any case, it&#39;s not personal. We don&#39;t have to agree on this to be friends, as far as I&#39;m concerned. {= )<br><br>Now, first, kindly note that I said &quot;most things,&quot; not every thing ever, and I even pointed out a non-canon scene that I particularly like. I&#39;m not asserting that filmmakers are robots who exist to turn books I like into movies.<br><br>Second, with that firmly established, I&#39;m not quite sure what you&#39;re meaning to defend in the case of the LotR films, especially since you&#39;ve mentioned you&#39;re not really a fan. As for me, I&#39;m basically objecting to Peter Jackson&#39;s established tendency to take a serious fantasy drama with noble characters and epic themes and, according to his stylistic choices and preferences, turn it into a cartoonish action romp with stupid, petty characters and no noticeable thematic overtones. Granted, this is far more obvious in the <i>Hobbit</i> films than the LotR ones, but I think you can see the tendency in most of the things I mentioned about the LotR films, nonetheless. If you disagree, would you care to discuss specific examples?<br><br>My basic point is that any changes should be done in service to the story as told in its new medium. If you need to cut some scenes, conflate some character roles, even make some things happen in a slightly different way if it&#39;ll save screen time and doesn&#39;t butcher the characters/themes in the process, go for it. Adding scenes that tell us nothing we needed to know, add to the run-time, and undercut the characters/themes, no. Changing the course of events in a way that makes less sense, adds to or doesn&#39;t change the run time, and butchers the characters/themes, no.<br><br>Also, to answer your question re. creative folks, even though I know it was rhetorical: That&#39;s what original writing and even fanfiction are for. And we don&#39;t like it much when people randomly insert their pepper-jack cheese into their fanfic, either. Bottom line, if you&#39;re choosing to tell a story that isn&#39;t yours, you&#39;re choosing <i>not</i> to exercise your full creative potential on it from square one.<br><br>Here&#39;s an analogy that might work:<br><br>So, J.R.R. Tolkien came up with this great cake recipe. He got really famous for it. Everybody loved his cake. (Okay, almost everybody; it was too heavy and rich for some. No problem, we love them anyway.)<br><br>Then along came Peter Jackson. He wanted to make Tolkien&#39;s cake recipe, but his modern kitchen was totally different from Tolkien&#39;s, so he had to do things a little differently. That would have been fine, but then he decided he wanted to put his own spin on the cake. Instead of butter, there&#39;s margarine. Okay, we can deal with that. But instead of chocolate, there&#39;s just carob, and there&#39;s these cinnamon candies that weren&#39;t there before, and the icing is too sweet now and also green for some reason, which doesn&#39;t really hurt anything but is kinda weird and off-putting. He calls it Tolkien&#39;s cake, and it&#39;s <i>mostly</i> still Tolkien&#39;s recipe, but when you eat it, it&#39;s not. And that&#39;s not nice.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I did not phrase what I was driving at very well, and I apologize if I caused any offense. Like you said, it&#39;s definitely not personal. My intent was to argue for a balance between preserving those elements that made the original work special with allowing for filmmakers in general to express their own sense of creativity within the fictional world.<br><br>Drastic differences between the source and the adaptation do not necessarily mean that the adaptation will be bad or should be dismissed.  I&#39;ve seen directors and writers make character-derailing changes and massive thematic alterations that ultimately benefited the end adaptation. <i>Jaws</i> is a good example of this. In the original novel by Peter Benchley, the main characters are pretty much always awful and mean-spirited. The film versions of Brody, Quint, and Hooper are definitely not. They only share cursory details with their literary counterparts. The film as a whole has at least a dozen scenes that were totally original. But it&#39;s still excellent.<br><br>Writing an adaptation is not truly analogous to writing fanfiction. Fanfiction is tailored to an audience that already knows what the world and characters are about. An adaptation has to appeal to those in the know, true, but it also has to bring in and appeal to newbies as well. Because an adaptation has to stand on its own, it is in many ways a property unto itself. The world might not be the new writer&#39;s, but this new version of the story is.<br><br>I want to tell an anecdote I heard about Neil Gaiman to sum up my feelings on adaptations. Apparently, when he read the script for <i>Coraline</i> he asked the screenwriter to make more changes so as to differ from the source material. If people wanted the book, he said, they would go read it.<br><br>As for defending the LotR films… I certainly face-planted right onto that one, didn&#39;t I? I would definitely disagree about there being no noticeable thematic overtones. I thought that the strength of friendship and loyalty concept was very much a recurring theme. It wasn&#39;t a consistent theme at times, but I would say it was there. Similarly, the need for someone to stand up and take responsibility seems to be repeated (Aragon as king, Frodo as the Ringbearer).<br><br>Since I alluded to having a specific example, I suppose I can argue for the presence of Haldir and his elves at the battle of Helm&#39;s Deep. First off, I would say their very presence is meant for three reasons: to give some hope to the characters (and the audience) in what is a very dire situation, to provide a call back to the alliance and battle at the beginning of the film, and to make the elves not seem so distant. Not having them show up could have made them seem unsympathetic, especially since they&#39;re all leaving Middle Earth (and, by extension, leaving Men to face Sauron alone). The fact that they all die could be seen as an allusion to that: the elves&#39;s time is over. They are gone and Men remain.<br><br>As for the death of Haldir himself, that has a simple if unsatisfactory reason: to set the stakes. The deaths of nameless soldiers can be dramatic, but nothing impresses upon an audience that things are serious than the death of a character they are familiar with. It&#39;s definitely a cheap trope, which is why I&#39;m not wholeheartedly rushing to Jackson&#39;s defense.<br><br>But I will fully admit pulling all that analysis out of my rear. I&#39;m no expert. My interest was far more focused on the practices of creating an adaptation.</p>

            <p>I agree that <i>Fellowship</i> has always been pretty good. Even though the Usual Suspects got cut (Bombadil, Glorfindel), it managed to convey the sense of <i>wonder</i> that we ought to get from Middle-earth. Rivendell is completely <i>wrong</i> (Tolkien repeatedly drew it as a single Swiss cottage), but it&#39;s very <i>elvish</i>.<br><br>But TTT-M... ugh. Flip Faramir&#39;s character motivation entirely on its head, flip <i>Theoden&#39;s</i> character motivation entirely on its head (people notice this one less, because it leads to the same results), randomly chuck Aragorn off a cliff, randomly kill Haldir, spend - per P@L&#39;s graphs - as much of the film on the battle that Tolkien once said could be <i>cut</i> as on the <i>Ringbearer</i>, ruin Gimli, ruin Treebeard... it just feels like they wrote an entirely different movie and then spliced the LotR stuff in.<br><br>RotK... yeah, you&#39;ve said it already.

            <p>Considering so much is just carried over from one trilogy to the other. This was one of the things that really bugged me, actually.<br><br>To be fair, we did get a couple of cool new songs/themes (Misty Mountain Song and Thorin&#39;s theme are quite good), but if you listen closely, you&#39;ll notice that the score spends an awful lot of time on (variations on) the Shire and Fellowship themes, and the Bad Guy music sounds an awful lot like the Bad Guy music from LotR, too.<br><br>I&#39;unno, I&#39;m no expert, but I was let down, and I really feel like Howard Shore could have done better.

            <p>I was probably a little emotional when I posted this thread. Yep, being misconstrued by someone I was trying to help really get on my nerves, but like what you had said, taking criticisms need experience and passion.<br><br>That Bleepfic series, according to my observations, had never received any negative feedbacks before until someone who was as traumatized as me posted a hyperbolic comment, and my critiques was actually written down under the author’s reply to her. That could possibly explain why the author had such a bad reaction to negative feedbacks——she was indeed inexperienced in receiving criticisms.<br><br>I tried to be as polite as possible in the critiques, but maybe I am still too blatant when pointing out mistakes instead of trying to talk about them in a more subtle manner.

            <p>As Desdendelle said, it very much depends on whether the author genuinely cares about their writing and how to improve it, and whether they&#39;re open enough to accept criticism. Unfotunately turns out that most badfic writers  I&#39;ve personally encountered don&#39;t seem to fit into either of those - which is somewhat infuriating, but also kind of a shame at the same time.</p>

            <p>A very serious continuum in general, and though this series of smut, Scriptfics and crack pairings may not be as horrifying and obnoxious in other continuum, it had definitely caused severe damage to the SCP Foundation canon due to its complete disregard of canon laws.<br><br>Thus, it qualified as a Bleepfic series in this situation.

            <p>Not all attempts at giving concrit are doomed to fail. I was successful(ish) once.<br><br>As I was looking through the <i>Bakugan</i> section of FFN, I ran across this series of fics. At first, the OC was believable, and what was then portrayed as the main conflict (the OC&#39;s sister mysteriously disappeared some time ago) was quite intriguing. But as the series went on, the OC became more and more Sueish, up to the point where the Sue became a &quot;secret member&quot; of the Battle Brawlers (the protagonists) and was actually a behind-the-scenes catalyst for canon events. That, on top of a clearly Sueish power, made me stop reading and offer some concrit. You know what? She actually took it to heart--but was about to resolve it the wrong way: &quot;I sometimes forget to point out her flaws and her overall rebellious attitude which can get in the way sometimes. ... I will try to de-sue her some more.&quot;<br><br>Fortunately, I responded quickly and got someone else to help clarify what made her OC a Sue.<br><br>I say &quot;successful(ish)&quot; because I don&#39;t know if she&#39;s gotten around to fixing them yet (though at least there are no further entries in the series), but I&#39;m sharing this to say that success is possible. There are authors willing to listen.</p>

            <p>There was one Warriors fic I found that summarized the first two chapters in a run-on sentence and was an Agnst!fic for sure, all in the summary.

So I PMed and told the author what I said about the summary-suck thing, said it was not a good idea at all to have the summary all in caps, and not to have it sound like you are begging for the audience to pity the MC. Thankfully, he said he could see some sense in all of that.

            <p>Sorry, guess I was speaking from assumptions just now.<br><br>Usually when a fiction&#39;s breach of canon laws is severe to a point that you could not find any trace from the original work apart from the names, the critiques one can give is probably limited to something along the line &quot;Would you kindly read/watch the work you are supposed to be a fan of, right from the start?&quot; <br><br>Yes. No matter how bad a fanfiction is, as long as the author is willing to take advice, everything is fine.<br><br>However, badfic authors rarely react well to critiques.

            <p>I’m not sure whether this is the reason why I found the pre- and post-mission parts more interesting than the mission itself, or whether it’s &quot;all I know about Redwall I learned from reading PPC missions, so I don’t care much&quot;.<br><br>Crash Dummies aren’t necessary? <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nHgR25Gys5uLNsxbBHr6SOo-oCJTyT8haRIUaYGBVdQ/edit?hl=en_US&amp;pli=1">Agent Cadmar and some others disagree</a>. <br><br>Yes, meta-fictionally, you don’t need a Dummy. TOS and early spin-offs don’t use Dummies, because Araeph had not invented them yet. If handling the Dummy would distract from the mission, you can get away with ignoring the fic’s first person nature, even when it’s obvious from quotes. (The Agents probably forgot the First-Person Dummy or don’t even know about it, because they were never properly trained, and they got away unpossessed because the Sue Wraith preferred acting out the story in a corporeal projection – because who understands the proceedings of a Wraith?) <br><br>But Natalie remembering the Dummy and leaving it behind, just because &quot;somebody&quot; told her that it isn’t really necessary makes her look either stupidly reckless or recklessly stupid to me.     <br><br><i>The ferret thought several random <b>things</b> ...</i><br>That’s a colloquialism I’m guilty of using too, but shouldn’t she actually have &quot;thought several random thoughts&quot;?<br><br><i>... which then led to some very random<b> thought</b> about animal-heat relief.</i><br>Combined with &quot;some&quot; (not &quot;one&quot;), these should be &quot;thoughts&quot; (plural). Did you try to avoid repetition when you made her think &quot;random things&quot; earlier?<br><br><i>I always knew Restoration, but it was buried <b>from</b> fear.</i><br>I would have said &quot;by fear&quot;, but maybe Khajiit talk like this?<br><br>And then Za’kiir is stupidly reckless or recklessly stupid just to check whether he learned healing.

            <p>And the reason they were sporked is that they were awful. I mean, in an objective story sense. Not because they were trollfics. Though, there is a lot of overlap between badfic and trollfic, due to bad writing being an easy trolling technique. It is also not clever or funny, and just plain amateur, at least when it&#39;s not used as satire.</p>

            <p>Forgive me if I&#39;ve hit on the reasons you said you were unsure about claiming it in the first place. See, ship internet gets sent via a chain of federal mermaid satellites and they can be quite notoriously unreliable, too much time combing their hair and singing rather than handling their satellites properly, after all, so it&#39;s made checking the board a bit of a chore. <br><br>I have to admit I have some hesitance at you claiming yet another Legendary? It&#39;s becoming rather something of a theme with your spin-off, the quanity of infamous fics you&#39;ve taken on. <br><br>This isn&#39;t to say that I think you&#39;ll do a bad job of it; it&#39;s more that my reaction was more around the lines of &#39;Again?&#39;. There are only so many fics we consider &quot;Legendary&quot; around, and while people who are currently on the board (who have seen this post) may not have expressed interest, there may yet be in the future.<br><br>-A July, who really needs to berate these mermaids   </p>

            <p>It seems to me that there is a consensus here that missioning Legendaries solely because they&#39;re Legendaries is Bad — if I get your parable (I <i>think</i> this is the right word?) correctly, it&#39;s like buying those limited-edition collectibles solely because they&#39;re limited-edition and because they&#39;re super-special mega-awesome figurines of Emperor Palpatine that actually shoot lightning or something.<br><br>(An economic-legal aside: AFAIK, unless stipulated otherwise ordering 75 limited-edition figurines out of a 100-figuring run is legit, at least here in Israel.)</p>

            <p>I get that hoarding a limited resource is Bad for obvious reasons. That&#39;s not what I have a problem with. It&#39;s the treatment of Legendary badfics as a limited resource (solely because they&#39;re infamous, mind; there is no dearth of bleepfics that simply don&#39;t make it to Legendary status because they&#39;re not infamous enough) that feels problematic to me. Like PC and others said elsewhere, you&#39;re not supposed to mission a Legendary solely because it&#39;s a Legendary; if you&#39;re not supposed to do that, then you&#39;re not supposed to look at whether a fic is Legendary or not when you think about claiming it (aside from in the &#39;can I write a funny mission on this <i>really</i> bad fic&#39; sense, but you&#39;d do that for bleepfics or WhatThe fics or stuff that goes to DAVD anyway... or any fic, really).</p>

            <p>We have added to the list of Legengedaries, very- and I stress that intensifier- very slowy since I joined. In <i>2007</i>. Since then, the ones I can remember being added to the list, and being present for to agree, yeah, those are legendary? Cupcakes and LBT: LxC. That&#39;s it. Out of that tiny list there. So yes, there <i>is*</i> a reason to treat them as a limited resource, and that is because they are.<br><br>To qualify, Des, in your initial response that we shouldn&#39;t treat &quot;Legendary&quot; badfic any different, I think the fact that we already qualify them as Legendary means we treat them as different right off the bat. <br><br>Just because everyone here right now isn&#39;t interested in claiming this particular Legendary doesn&#39;t automatically mean Iximaz should have an all-clear to have on her kill-list a good portion of the list we have. <br><br>A very small fraction of the Boarders around now were here back when I first joined; would it still be okay and fair to newer boarders who weren&#39;t around back then if, say, to borrow names from the past, Anjilly had taken up a bunch of the Legendaries? Or Rilwen? Or Laburnum? Or Araeph? <br><br>And as for your aside to hS regarding the what-if about limited edition collectibles: just because something is &#39;legal&#39; doesn&#39;t make it right or fair, which is something I believe we as a community also try to aim for.<br><br>My objection isn&#39;t &#39;making missions out of Legendaries for the sake of it&#39;. That is already an understood matter at large, and we have done a pretty good job of hammering it into people that we don&#39;t go after fics that are Awful Just Because They Are So Awful We Need to Show Everyone How Much Awful We Can Tolerate Compared To You. It is &#39;we only have so many Legendaries, and we still have people join every month, and some of them even stick around for years. It isn&#39;t fair to those new people and people who haven&#39;t even shown up yet that Iximaz has claimed so many Legendaries and done missions for them, leaving others without that opportunity.&#39; <br><br>-July</p>

            <p>Speaking to this particular claim, loads of people have had the chance to mission &quot;My Immortal&quot; over the years, and no one&#39;s done it. If Iximaz comes along and actually wants to, and is pretty sure she can pull it off (which I think we all know by now that she can), why shouldn&#39;t she? How long has this particular collectible lightning-shooting red car been sitting on the lot, gathering dust?<br><br>Same argument goes for the other Legendaries Ix has taken. Most of them, if not all of them, have been sitting around unmissioned for years, waiting for someone with the right combination of interest, time, and perseverance to come along and claim them. It seems like Ix is just the rare individual they&#39;ve been waiting for. I don&#39;t think assuming that another like her is going to come along anytime soon makes sense.<br><br>That said, I do take the point that putting so many Legendaries in one spin-off seems... eh, I don&#39;t know, exactly. Vaguely wrong somehow. Maybe because it seems to clash with how things appear to work in-universe? But we&#39;re not talking about in-universe, we&#39;re talking about a spin-off. But then, supposing we&#39;re looking for some sort of normal missions-to-Legendaries ratio, the Aviator has, I think, something like 40 completed missions and interludes to her name. Four of those are Legendaries. That&#39;s, what, a whopping ten percent of the spin-off?<br><br>To compare, Dafydd&#39;s spin-off totals 18 stories, two of which are Legendaries. (Three, if you count &quot;Woodsprite of the North,&quot; but we won&#39;t here.) His ratio is actually a little higher than Ave&#39;s one in ten. The only difference between them is that his ended and hers is still going, so there&#39;s no longer a possibility that he&#39;ll do more.<br><br>... I dunno, guys. The truth is, I don&#39;t really have a huge stake in this either way. Personally, I&#39;m only interested in one Legendary, and I don&#39;t much care what happens to the rest. Plus, I consider myself to have tackled one already in &quot;Blood Raining Night&quot;; it&#39;s just that it isn&#39;t acknowledged as such because it&#39;s freaking impossible to get this community to agree on a policy for deciding when to acknowledge new ones, so it doesn&#39;t count. Supposing you wanted to hunt Legendary-quality badfic without sparking a debate like this one, all you&#39;d have to do is keep an eye out in other places on the Internet and nab the ones the PPC hasn&#39;t tagged yet. So, I guess I don&#39;t really see the point of getting fussed about it.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Dafydd and Selene may have treated it like a Big Thing, but unless you remember otherwise, I think it was just a random badfic.<br><br>(Dafydd: &quot;Just because people haven&#39;t heard of it doesn&#39;t make it easy to deal with!&quot;)<br><br>You (er, Nesh, not Dafydd) make a good point - though one could point out that a) <i>my</i> missions:legendaries ratio is a lot smaller, and b) there&#39;s a lot of agents who aren&#39;t Dafydd out there - and one that hadn&#39;t crossed my mind.

            <p>I think I said what I think and don&#39;t have anything constructive to contribute, except for two things:<br>a) I think that what differentiates Legendaries from Bleepfics is precisely the infamy. There are a lot of horrible writing out there — off the top of my head, there&#39;s TSAB DOWNFALL: Halo War, Everybody In Annie&#39;s Forest, Rose cuts the doctors penis off and puts it in a sock (yes, that&#39;s a thing, Ix and Scape missioned it), Harry Potter and the Four Founders — but none of it is considered Legendary because people didn&#39;t hear about them. <br>Which brings me to b) can we try again to reach a consensus on how to &quot;add&quot; new Legendaries?</p>

            <p>I&#39;d love to get a consensus on that.<br><br>To respond to something hS said, and one reason I think consensus is so difficult: What you&#39;ve heard of largely depends how active you are in a given fandom and/or the places on the Internet where fanfic gets talked about. Back in the day, most PPCers were active in LotR fan communities, so they knew what everyone was buzzing about because they were <i>there</i>, doing it. Nowadays, not only do we not all share a unifying fandom, not all of us are active in our fandoms beyond the PPC, either.<br><br>I speak here of myself. These days, I pretty much only hear about the fics that set their fandoms abuzz when someone mentions them here or I happen to stumble across them on Channel Awesome or Buzzfeed or something. (I am thus often behind the times.) I suspect this goes for many of us.<br><br>I mention this because, in the past, people have wanted the yardstick for Legendaries to be that they&#39;re legendary <i>among PPCers</i>. This clearly doesn&#39;t work; fics only get legendary among PPCers these days if their mission makes them so.<br><br>Taking a left-turn here (because I&#39;m tired and holding a train of thought is hard), responding to another thing hS said: Legendary Missions.

            <p>You said earlier that we don&#39;t all share the same fandoms any more - that cuts in on this idea, too. I&#39;ve only read a couple of Trojie and Pads&#39; missions, partly because I&#39;m not interested in high-rating reading, but also because HP isn&#39;t my fandom. I recognise the Piratate from that word alone, and Honesah solely from her Mirror counterpart... it&#39;s all gotten too big for everyone to have common &#39;great missions&#39; in their minds.<br><br>The Story Awards might well work - though, yikes, you&#39;ve got eleven categories there, do we even <i>make</i> that many stories a year?

            <p>The colour is one of the least important factors when you come to choose a car. You want to look at stuff like fuel efficiency, handling, comfort and so on.

            <p>And so, the Baroness Iximaz prepares to go off on yet another quest that none of the Knights of Plort would dare to undertake. Scarcely one year has passed since she battled against the Cult of Six Roses, said battle having badly damaged the Baroness and broken the bow Rina. Now armed with her remade bow, alternatively named Rina, Aviator, and a name unpronounceable to most not from the lands of Doktaru, Iximaz ventures forth against a vile Marizu of many names, one of which being Raven Way.<br><br>The skies over Castle De&#39;endee fill with Air&#39;ihpotre post owls from all over Plort, the letters containing well-wishes for the departing Baroness, offers from practitioners of Beytah to ride beside her on her quest, or inquiries as to her sanity; surely one must be mad to face a Marizu like Raven Way when she had barely recovered from her fight against the Cult of Six Roses!<br><br>The following is the letter of the wanderer Filius Caeli:<br><i>Esteemed Baroness,<br>I have recently heard that milady is planning to venture against the Marizu Raven Way. Were I more knowledgeable in the ways of Jakaiar, I would offer my services, but alas! I fear I cannot render my aid in such a fashion. I only hope that Kanun and Spelin protect you, and that your devotion to Jaikaiar does you well in this quest. Know that, as always, I will be there to welcome you on your return.<br><br>The best of luck to you, Lady Iximaz.<br><br>Signed,<br>Filius Caeli, Wanderer of Weab, Seeker of Lore</i><br><br>((When I saw that you were planning on taking on <i>My Immortal</i>, this idea came to mind, so here it is. Good luck with sporking yet <i>another</i> Legendary Badfic. Did you buy enough M&amp;Ms for this one? Maybe you should invest in some tea as well.<br><br>SOH176))</p>

            <p>So, last time I posted these prompts, it was a fail. But thanks to games like Fire Emblem, I learned obstination, no matter how great the failure. So here I am again, to ask Permission, hoping to add my writing to the awesome and crazy universe of the PPC. I offer all my thanks to Dorano, SkarmorySilver and Tira for their hard work as beta readers. I couldn&#39;t have posted this without them.<br><br>Without further additions, I&#39;ll post the prompts:<br><br>-<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tjGq_uJY8vs9uewq1VSXFROs6gayEhcCR3J70ZAEzb0/edit?usp=sharing">The Agents of RC 2882437</a>.<br><br>-<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tyvV8aDdjEon4fQivmXfapPEVrgYkRvhxPME0l3ze-c/edit?usp=sharing">Permission Prompt 1</a>.<br><br>-<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/18TwkuaiVUYNfTgcjm6Ym2k_eKdC7jOEdyvDeqk83kO4/edit?usp=sharing">Permission Prompt 2</a>.<br><br>-The badfic who would be my first mission: <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11158773/1/WhatYouWishFor">WhatYouWishFor</a>.<br><br>Now, I can only hope for success.

            <p>I checked back in on one of my Frozen fanfics and found that someone had written a story. In the review section. I&#39;m not kidding. There&#39;s eleven pages of review, and ten of them are taken up with what appears to be a story about Anna, Elsa, and their OC little sisters Faith and Hope, and as far as I know, it doesn&#39;t have anything to do with my story. <br><br>I haven&#39;t read it yet (the author hasn&#39;t really grasped paragraph breaks), and I&#39;m confused about what to do. I&#39;ve never seen this sort of thing before, or at least, I&#39;ve never seen an author&#39;s note that asked people to stop writing stories in the reviews.<br><br>So, I&#39;ve got two questions for you guys. First, has this happened to any of you before?<br><br>Second, what should I do with it? Delete it for taking up space, or keep it there? Let a PPC-er check it out for possible missioning?<br><br>If anyone wants to check it out, here&#39;s where it begins (there are some actual comments on my story on this page, but this is where the sub-story starts):<br><br><a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/r/10975986/0/10/"><a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/r/10975986/0/10/">https://www.fanfiction.net/r/10975986/0/10/</a></a></p>

            <p>But it wasn&#39;t one of mine, so I didn&#39;t bother to save the link. (As I recall, the actual story wasn&#39;t so hot, either.)<br><br>The review you linked to honestly reminds me of this girl I used to watch on dA called &quot;Becca Lupin&quot;. Maybe you&#39;ve heard of her; she did parodies of Disney/Dreamworks movies with casts of other shows. Then it just spun into giant multiverse crossovers. AFAIK, she still does parodies, but starring her and, of all people, Gerard Way/his &quot;Killjoy&quot; alter ego (any MCR fans wanna explain that?).<br><br>Go ahead, spork it. It should be hilarious. &gt;:)</p>

            <p>... but long enough ago that I&#39;d forgotten everything. :D It&#39;s good! Shame the author doesn&#39;t seem to have written anything else... :-/<br><br>The &#39;fake forum/chatroom&#39; is a really interesting way to tell a story. I&#39;ve mucked about with it a few times myself - I think the only one online is the <a href="http://huinesoron.webs.com/netilardo/Theory18.htm">New Perspective on Middle-earth</a> forums, but I&#39;ve done others (mostly chat-logs). I think it&#39;s because it makes the most outlandish ideas come across as accepted and everyday - time travel must be pretty ordinary if people are chatting about it on a website. <sup>_<sup><br><br>Not</sup></sup> that this is original to chatrooms/forums - <i>Dracula</i> consists in large part of false-document letters and journals, which are aiming at the same effect (and of course Tolkien&#39;s <i>Notion Club Papers</i> are the minutes of meetings) - but I think the forum version actually works better, simply because it lets you write a real-time story.<br><br>Does anyone know of other examples of this type of writing?

            <p>Zeb gets some new weapons, there&#39;s one less Sue to worry about, and that was one fantastic execution method! Also, nice to see that you pointed out the Said-Ism problem, which is something I myself used to be guilty of.

            <p>Fixed the first. The second I&#39;m pretty sure is right... Anyone?<br><br>Said Bookism is fine on occasion; like, if the agents are speaking and it&#39;s not immediately clear from the dialogue how they&#39;re saying it or you want to emphasize how they&#39;re saying it is when they&#39;re okay (my opinion only, mind!), but when you&#39;ve got these massively long chapters and are averaging &#39;said&#39; as a dialogue tag three times per chapter, it&#39;s massively distracting.

            <p>I hope you get better soon Iximaz. Anyway, on to the computer mumbo-jumbo:<br><br>HTML has three (and in some cases five) characters that have a special meaning to the browser when they appear in text. They are &lt;, &gt;, &amp; and sometimes &#39; and &quot;. In general, if you want to use any of the first three, you need to escape them. To do this, you do as follows:<br><br><br><br><br><br><table>
<tbody><tr>
<th>To show</th>
<th>Type</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&lt;</td>
<td>&amp;lt;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&gt;</td>
<td>&amp;gt;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&lt;</td>
<td>&amp;gt;</td>
</tr></p>

<p></tbody></table>
<br>Now, you can sometimes get away without doing this because browsers try really hard to deal with people who don&#39;t know how to write HTML. (This is why the whole &quot;weird color names&quot; thing works as well). However, you need to use escaping when you write things that might look like tags, such as anything an Andalite might say.<br><br>(For bonus recursion fun, &quot;View Source&quot; on this post) </p>

            <p>Hi, guys. If you notice the wiki&#39;s infoboxes looking a little different, that&#39;s because I&#39;ve updated them all to be portable to mobile devices, as per Wikia&#39;s standards (and repeated urgings that finally got on my nerves enough to act).<br><br>The main difference you&#39;ll see is that infobox images are now scaled to take up the full width of the infobox instead of being thumbnail-sized. In some cases, this may mean they look kind of huge. I do not know how to fix this, except to use images that are more wide than tall. It&#39;s irritating, and I&#39;ll continue trying to fix it, but so far my efforts have only resulted in distorted images. Sigh. In the meantime, if your pages are really screwed up by huge infobox images, consider uploading a new image at a smaller size, or with dimensions more wide than tall, and using that instead.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>It would be relatively easy (If tedious) to add a white layer behind each image, and then re-upload it. Create a border/buffer. I am beyond exhausted right now, though, so I&#39;m not completely sure if I read the problem correctly. Ignore me if I didn&#39;t.<br><br>As I said, this would be tedious to do, so in my professional opinion as a complete slacker, we should just grumble loudly about it, but not actually do anything.</p>

            <p>Honestly, most of the ones we have are more dumb than anything.  Their single, driving instinct is to eat things, so they generally only have one, &quot;is this edible&quot; reaction to most stimuli.<br><br>We have nearly all females at my zoo; I&#39;ve heard the males can be awful, but the one male we do have is pretty much no different from all the females.  There is one female who is weirdly aggressive; fortunately, she&#39;s a much lighter shade of grey than everyone else.  (Thank you, Gan, for color-coding the dangerous one!)  One day, while I was volunteering with keepers who were cleaning their pond in the train ride yard, a bunch of ostriches all started walking into the empty pond in single file.  We were almost done cleaning, so I started petting them as they walked by, and kept talking to the keepers.  The ostriches continued by, oblivious to even being touched by me, until I got to the Grey One.  She immediately flinched backwards and hissed, stared at me for a second in surprise, and then fluffed her wings out, hissed louder and charged.  (They usually stamp their feet before they attack, but she did not do so.)  I started to turn to run, and had time to see her foot kick about six inches to the side of my torso, where part of my body had been before I turned.  (I yelled, &quot;Help!&quot; at some point, too, but don&#39;t really remember when.)  I ran straight for the bridge that takes the train over the pond and jumped from one concrete support berm to the other—ostriches don&#39;t handle uneven ground very well— and nearly ran into a pair of Stanley cranes.  The Stanleys are mean, too, but don&#39;t have the body mass to kill a human like ostriches do, so getting kicked by them would have been a very acceptable trade-off for escaping the Grey One, but the cranes were so shocked by a human showing such carelessness towards them, they just kind of stared at me, stunned.  So then I jumped back to the first berm, where the ostrich had already wandered away due to lack of interest/food.  When the zookeepers tell that story about me, they say I &quot;outran an ostrich.&quot;  Not seeing the ostrich herself after the kick, I can&#39;t really corroborate that, and it couldn&#39;t have been more than ten feet, but . . . I guess it is kind of impressive I avoided getting hurt?<br><br>But as I was saying, mostly ostriches nip at things to see if it&#39;s food.  And sometimes, they nip at no things—they just stand there biting at air for minutes straight every once in a while.  The problem with my hands is that in winter, my skin gets all dry and cracks apart, and I think the one ostrich thought the red spots on my hand were edible.  And then she ended up adding to the red marks, where usually, their &quot;bites&quot; are just slight scratches that don&#39;t bleed.<br><br>And this morning, a Cape Barren goose landed a direct hit on the ostrich bite with the weaponized knob bone on his wrist, and made it hurt far more than the ostrich initially did.  Have I mentioned birds are the absolute worst thing there is?<br><br>—doctorlit apologizes for answering your one-sentence question with this giant essay in the middle of your discussion about the wiki.</p>

            <p>Status seems like a good idea, even if most of them will be &quot;Incomplete.&quot; As far as I know, OFUM, HFA, and IAHF are the only ones with sequels, though. And possibly the only ones that are complete, too. ... Well, okay, OFUDisc, even if they didn&#39;t exactly get through a school year. Any others?<br><br>I also feel like there should be an Author section. I&#39;m just not sure whether to put it at the top or the bottom. &quot;Written by:&quot; is always at the top, but in this case it would sorta interrupt the flow of School Name - Crest - Motto - Color(s) - Minis. So, maybe under Course Coordinator(s), and then additional meta-type information after that?<br><br>Maybe continuum should be in there somewhere? But that&#39;s pretty obvious in most cases, isn&#39;t it?<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Wobbles, it had to be said, wasn&#39;t normally one for power metal, not least because she could only intermittently get her stereo to work and, when she did, her partner had a tendency to perform violent acts when it played anything louder than cool jazz. She&#39;d been looking forward to Former Agent Illian&#39;s program for some time and, when it was broadcast, she went down to the A/V Division and watched it with an expression of glee, only intermittently interrupted by small explosions as her weight shifted on the sofa cushions and found various lost remote controls. Not even the occasional bursts of silvery sparks could stop her from bouncing up and down with excitement, and when the program was finally over she bounced up off the sofa and somersaulted over to the coffee table.<br><br>&quot;Oh gosh oh gosh that was AWESOME! Thank you so much for letting me watch it with you, gangeroos! I gotta get to my RC and work on something for Mister Illian to say thank you for making more good TV, so seeya later!&quot;<br><br>She tumbled --  in the circus tumbling sense, it must be stressed -- out of the A/V Division&#39;s door and launched herself back towards her RC. A few dazed-looking technicians crawled out, one of whom was holding the remains of a genuine sonic blaster and making small whimpering noises. In complete silence, a senior geek walked over to the notice board and flipped the &quot;Days Without Incident/Terror/Fire And Screaming/HER&quot; counter back to 0, then curled up in the corner with a teddy bear and started to cry. The room stank of burnt plastic and whatever pollen the purple daffodils growing out of the sofa cushions were spreading around the place. There was wailing and gnashing of teeth.<br><br>Wobbles, as was her wont when dealing with the A/V Division&#39;s techies, did her best to ignore it.<br><br>Instead, she went to her RC and began work on something very, very elaborate. After about an hour, she took the first few pieces out into the hallway and went off to Stores to sequester more white sculpting balloons. For eighteen solid hours she worked, the near-constant squeaking burrowing into her partner&#39;s ears until she stomped off to Rudi&#39;s for drinks and filing, lamenting a lack of pins or sharp objects in the immediate vicinity. Wobbles worked and sweated over the sculpture, consulting printed diagrams and photographs, even a watercolour of the place in question, until at last it was complete.<br><br>A few days later, a delivery arrived by portal in the Illians&#39; garden. Wobbles carefully lowered it into place and began to lash it to the ground, tying and staking with handmade ropes and a mallet made of Discworld bog-oak she was having seriously possessive thoughts about. She wanted to see Dafydd&#39;s family&#39;s faces (and his own) when they woke up to see Mindon Eldaliйva, that most kingly of all towers and seat of Ingwл Ingweron, in splendid bouncy castle form. With that, there was but one last finishing touch, and Wobbles paced deliberately backwards from her work.<br><br>&quot;Okay, Mister Sproggins, I&#39;m at the distance you said you wanted. You&#39;re good to go!&quot;<br><br>A/V Technician Albert Sproggins emerged tremulously from the portal, clutching a gravity globe from <i>Doctor Who</i> like it was a bomb about to go off. Wobbles personally thought it was a bit unfair, but she had brushed past him once and his digital watch had ended up as a tattoo on his forehead, so she understood why he was scared. He tapped the globe and sent it upwards, letting its silvery light shine out as the globe reached its nest of white balloons at the top of the tower and hung there, awaiting the wonder of the children.<br><br>Albert, being a cautious sort who had no idea what Wobbles&#39; acute arcane technometaplasia would do to an antigravity device, promptly hurled himself through the portal and was currently running towards the Cryptomusic Archive. His scream, according to the various computer monitors listening out for Wobbles&#39; approach, was a comparatively mild Grade 4, so the other technicians were content to let their delicate repair work continue.<br><br>Wobbles, still in the garden, dexterously unfolded an old wooden deck chair (a feat not since repeated in the annals of human history), sat in the garden, and listened to the birdsong.<br><br>---<br><br>I hope that&#39;s okay, and while I understand it might give Dafydd flashbacks to the massive, massive stupidity of the Oath of Feanor, Wobbles isn&#39;t <i>that</i> up on the First Age. Enormous tomes like <i>The Silmarillion</i> aren&#39;t really her bag; to paraphrase <i>Better Than Life</i>, it&#39;s not that she doesn&#39;t read, it&#39;s just that she generally waits for the cartoon to come out. Also a slight case of well-intentioned B&amp;E, but whatcha gonna do? =]</p>

            <p>Dafydd threw back the curtains to let in the morning sunlight, looked out at the view, rubbed his eyes, checked again, and then closed the curtains tightly. &quot;Connie?&quot; he said.<br><br>&quot;Mm?&quot; His wife&#39;s reply came from the midst of the nest of duvets that had previously been their bed. Other than a tuft of black hair draped over the pillow, there was no sign of Constance.<br><br>Dafydd took another peek out of the window, peering between the curtains. &quot;Did... did we move back to Tirion while I wasn&#39;t looking?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Mm-mm.&quot; The pile of duvets shook slightly, which might have been Constance&#39;s headshake, or might not.<br><br>&quot;Hmm.&quot; Dafydd drummed his fingers on the windowledge. &quot;Because I think we&#39;ve ended up in Grandfather&#39;s palace overnight.&quot;<br><br>There was a pause, and then Constance&#39;s head emerged from the blankets. &quot;In the nicest possible way: have you gone completely bonkers?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I wish.&quot; Dafydd went to tug the curtain open again, but stopped himself. &quot;But the <i>Mindon</i>&#39;s right outside the window, and...&quot; He shrugged.<br><br>Constance gave a long-suffering sigh and crawled out of bed. Draping one of the duvets haphazardly around herself, she crossed the room and leant on her husband&#39;s shoulder. &quot;Show.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Er.&quot; Dafydd glanced at her. &quot;Can I borrow some of the-?&quot;<br><br>&quot;No. You got me out of bed for this, you can freeze.&quot; Constance reached across and drew the curtains back. &quot;...huh.&quot;<br><br>&quot;See?&quot; Dafydd ducked away from his wife and grabbed a fresh tunic from the wardrobe. &quot;And you thought I was crazy.&quot;<br><br>&quot;You <i>are</i> crazy,&quot; Constance said. &quot;And unobservant. That&#39;s a bouncy castle.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Don&#39;t be silly; no-one makes Valinor-themed bouncy castles.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Tell that to the kids.&quot; Constance smiled and waved out of the window, then had to grab at the duvet to keep it from falling away. &quot;They think it&#39;s great fun.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Um.&quot; Dafydd closed his eyes for a second, delving through his short-term memory. &quot;There&#39;s someone with red hair sitting out there, right? Tell me it&#39;s not one of my brothers.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I dunno.&quot; Constance pursed her lips. &quot;Do any of them have a thing for clown costumes...?&quot;<br><br><hr>
<br><br>Other reaction lines might have (or might still, since their lives don&#39;t end just because the scene does) included:<br><br>&quot;Yes. It&#39;s very nice. I mean, for a monument to the father of my father&#39;s least-favourite stepmother which he entirely deliberately used as the backdrop to the stupidest Oath <i>ever made</i>.&quot;<br><br>&quot;When did our home become the Calacirya, anyway? Didn&#39;t we move here so the PPC <i>couldn&#39;t</i> find us?&quot;<br><br>&quot;But! I <i>wuv</i> it!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Father, can we go and see the <i>real</i> Mindon? And the Trees? ... and can we meet Grandfather?&quot;<br><br>(To which Dafydd&#39;s answers are &#39;no&#39;, &#39;no&#39;, and &#39;seriously, Tanfin, you need to get over this obsession with him&#39;.)<br><br><sup>_^</sup> Thank you!

            <p><i>Tree Fu Tom</i> is the Doctor&#39;s counter to the Vashta Nerada.<br><br>Having witnessed the <a href="http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/In_the_Forest_of_the_Night_(TV_story)">trees of Earth having their growth boosted by microscopic creatures to shield the planet from a solar flare</a>*, the Tenth** Doctor has an epiphany: the high-speed glowing dust-fairy things <i>will eventually become the Vashta Nerada</i> - y&#39;know, the <i>other</i> tiny communal lifeform with a connection to trees.<br><br>And why will creatures that acted to save the planet one day turn against humans and start eating them? Simple, the episode answers that: because humans spend all their time trying to murder their trees.<br><br>So Ten seeks out one of his old companions - Ace, who is now <a href="http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/A_Charitable_Earth">apparently running a charity anyway</a>*** - and together they pitch a new TV series to the BBC - one which will make the children of Earth respect trees (and nature in general), and thus ward off the turning-evil of the Vashta Nerada: <i>Tree Fu Tom</i>.<br><br>*Or whatever <i>In the Forest...</i> was all about.<br>**Yes, Tenth. He was actually instrumental in getting the trees to do that, while Eleven just mucked about with schoolkids.<br>***I suggest that this takes place at the very end of Ten&#39;s lifespan, while he was on his Grand Tour Of Companions (ie, during the last minutes of <i>The End of Time</i>). The fact that it&#39;s cracking-up!Ten explains why he&#39;s willing to break history this way, too.<br><br>There are no flaws in this idea. None.<br><br>hS</p>
