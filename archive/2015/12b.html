            <p>You&#39;d think that after the success of my canon counterpart, relatively speaking, they&#39;d continue the tradition rather than resorting to the same approach as they&#39;ve done with Link, which does get a bit tired after a while if you ask me. The dialogue of the original Xenoblade Chronicles was part of what made it so distinct among RPGs, especially the interactions between me and m- er, <i>Shulk</i> and his friends. Shulk! Heheh. Um.<br><br>What I&#39;m more concerned about, though, is why they changed up the setting completely and used a world more akin to Metroid rather than, oh, exploring the new Bionis or something along those lines. From what I&#39;ve seen of it, the only things similar to the original Xenoblade are the title and the presence of Nopons! I&#39;ve heard a lot of good things about Xenoblade X, but it feels more like a spiritual successor than anything else, and from what I&#39;ve gathered, it pretty much is.<br><br>Ah, well. I haven&#39;t had the time to play the game myself, but that may change if they introduce compatibility with Shulk&#39;s amiibo soon...</p>

            <p>it&#39;s an open world like <i>Xenoblade Chronicles</i>, and the graphics are just as stunning (there&#39;s a cutscene in the prologue that is basically there to show you just how stunning the world is). The mission system seems to take some cues from <i>Lightning Returns</i> in that almost any NPC can have a mission for you. The arts system is there, of course, as well as its upgrade system (though for some reason, <i>X</i> doesn&#39;t show you the BP cost to upgrade until you select the Art itself). Combat is largely unchanged, but this time, there&#39;s a display on the screen to show you where you are relative to the enemy, making it easier to tell if arts like Slit Edge will have their bonus effects.<br><br>As for what you brought up, I really don&#39;t think that they should have gone for a straight sequel the the original <i>Xenoblade Chronicles</i>; the ending gives a sufficient sense of closure, and you know what sometimes happens when you force a sequel onto a perfectly wrapped-up story. But I do agree in one point: if you are going to give it the <i>Xenoblade</i> name, you should know that you are also setting up certain expectations.<br><br>Given my (admittedly paltry) hours of gameplay, I don;t think that <i>Xenoblade Chronicles X</i> is a bad game at all. But so far, I don&#39;t see what merits the hype or the <i>Xenoblade</i> name. But then again, I&#39;ve only played it for a few hours. Here&#39;s hoping that it doesn&#39;t disappoint.</p>

            <p>&#39;Cause it involves FicPsych, and I kinda like to keep an eye on what goes on in FicPsych.<br><br>And, I can&#39;t help but notice that you seem to have Ami visiting the wrong nurse. You&#39;ve written a kindly, down-to-earth type person. Loquacious Immac, however, is a bubbly airhead who means well, but is not always 100% up on her situational awareness. FicPsych&#39;s Pinkie Pie, if you will.<br><br>I&#39;mma take a wild guess at what happened here: You originally wrote the scene for Jennifer Robinson, but somebody pointed out that you&#39;d need my permission to use her, and you didn&#39;t want to run the risk of being told no after you&#39;d already finished writing, so instead you ran down the list of Free-to-Use nurses and swapped in Immac&#39;s name without stopping to read any of her previous appearances to see what she&#39;s like.<br><br>I think so because of this line from page 7, which appears to have been missed by the three of you:<br><br><i>Ami pawed at the floor. &quot;Um… I’ll have to pass, thanks. I don’t wanna be late for my session with <u>Nurse Robinson</u>.&quot;</i><br><br>How close am I?<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>...you&#39;re absolutely right. :( I was the one who pointed it out to eatpraylove, as well, since I didn&#39;t want a repeat of when I used Alex Dives without Iximaz looking over the work in question beforehand. I apologize on behalf of both of us for this oversight, and we will have it corrected ASAP.<br><br>Alas, I&#39;ll be off to D...il after Christmas, but once I get back, I&#39;ll see if we can rewrite Immac&#39;s dialogue to sound more in-character. It&#39;s her responsibility, however - not only was I not the one responsible, but between cleaning up for a pet-sitter and preparing for the trip, I&#39;m afraid I&#39;ll be too busy to make any major changes before heading out of town. :C</p>

            <p>Not getting the canonical Flowers right is apparently one of his berserk buttons. But I’m not sufficiently confident to throw an in-character fit. Still, I have issues with <i>not daring to divert her gaze from the giant plant</i> and <i>as if a giant telepathic plant wasn’t strange enough</i>.<br><br>I assume that the Marquis de Sod is a giant daisy and Captain Dandy is a giant dandelion, so that both can talk on blossom level to the SO, who is just an ordinary sized sunflower. But what exactly is gigantic with the Lichen? Growing all over its office is just what lichen does if nothing inhibits its growth. The scene and the later reminiscence felt to me as if you imagined another plant and missed the opportunity to convey this Department Head’s specific weirdness (like Sarah not knowing where exactly to gaze when it’s actually everywhere).<br><br>Also, not promoting my services here, but how could all three of you miss this:<br><i>... Nurse Loquacious Immac, who is free-to-use and was created <b>by to</b> Neshomeh.</i><br><br>HG</p>

Only one more group of reinforcements needed...<br><br><i>But four will return, the last set free.</i><br>Deat is too obvious in my opinion, something else will happen. Besides, if my statements about teams for five is rue, nothing about &#39;whole&#39; teams coming back.

Keep in mind that as with PJO and the Warriors series (both of which inspired this prophecy plot in the first place), there&#39;s enough vagueness in some of the wordings that the way things will come to pass may not be what you might expect. All I can say is that there are some things you&#39;ve got right, others you&#39;ve got wrong, and still others that are somewhere in between. ;)<br><br>I won&#39;t be addressing this prophecy directly for a while due to Real Life and a lineup of missions I have planned, but it will be discussed a few more times before it comes to pass. When it does, though, you WILL know it, I promise! :D</p>

            <p>Lots of the untextured ones were made by me, actually. I&#39;ve tried to aim for a unified &quot;clipart&quot; style, with simple colors and such that would make for easily recognizable insignia. But, lots were also made by various people for their own departments/divisions (hence the variance in style), and I haven&#39;t wanted to mess with those, out of respect for others&#39; contributions and historical value.<br><br>That said, we could always include historical patches in addition to modern, unified-style ones... It&#39;d be kind of nice to have them all looking sharp and clean, and the same size. I use circles of 300x300 px, for reference.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>It&#39;s that time of the year again! We&#39;ve got quite a few pieces lined up for release, and they&#39;re all in need of a beta or two. We have:<br>-An interlude. A spoilerific interlude. We need betas for SPaG and flow, mostly. No canon knowledge required.<br>-A <i>Doctor Who</i> mission. Again, betas for SPaG and flow, <i>Doctor Who</i> knowledge nice but not required. Possible TW for PTSD.<br>-Another interlude. Not as spoilerific as the other one. Same deal when it comes to beta services:  SPaG and flow, no canon knowledge required.<br>Takers should post their email addresses so we will be able to share the GDocs with them.</p>

            <p>Okay, I&#39;ve decided to share this, because it really blew my mind, although an explanation is ridiculously simple...<br><br>So, remember how Clara asked Missy in <i>The Magician&#39;s Apprentice</i> since when has she [Missy] cared about the Doctor? Quoting the response:<br><br>&quot;<i>Since always. Since the Cloister Wars. Since the night he stole the moon and the President’s wife. Since he was a little girl. One of those was a lie – can you guess which one?</i>&quot;<br><br>We all assumed that Missy took a twist on the &#39;Arson, Murder, and Jaywalking&#39; Trope and that the last one was a lie. I mean, we know for a fact that every regeneration of the Doctor was male, right?<br><br>Well now, remember <i>Hell Bent</i> and Twelve and Clara in the Cloisters? He said that the claim he &quot;stole the moon and the president&#39;s wife&quot; is a lie. Now, if we&#39;re believe that Missy really only told ONE lie that time...<br><br>Then we have something to think about, don&#39;t we?</p>

            <p>At this point, I&#39;m not entirely sure myself whether that line was supposed to be simply a throwaway joke, or if Missy was actually being serious. It could be that she&#39;s referring to a future incarnation of his (since they&#39;re both time travelers, and we know for a fact that the Doctor can&#39;t have been female before). <br><br>I guess we&#39;ll have to wait and see if the subject comes up in a future episode?</p>

            <p>In case you&#39;re not familiar with the show that was <i>Mystery Science Theater 3000</i>, here&#39;s a quick rundown: a man and his two robotic pals are trapped in space and forced to watch terrible movies. They keep their sanity by riffing over each film. It ran from 1988 to 1999 on two different networks and was absolutely amazing. <br><br>And now, it&#39;s coming back. Show creator Joel Hodgson&#39;s <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/mst3k/bringbackmst3k/description">Kickstarter campaign</a> to revive the show (which just concluded) brought in over $5.7 million dollars worth of donations. There will be 14 new episodes, including a holiday special. There will also be a brand new cast, with Jonah Ray as the hapless man trapped in space, Hampton Yount and Baron Vaughn as the &#39;bots, and Felicia Day and Patton Oswalt as the mad scientists. The writing staff is a mix of old and new, with a few guests possibly thrown in on occasion.<br><br>I&#39;m super excited about this, in case it wasn&#39;t obvious. <i>MST3K</i> was one of the shows that made my childhood. Yeah, the new one definitely won&#39;t be the same, but to see it come back is still a thrill. It&#39;ll be interesting to see what the new writers add to the equation.<br><br>Does anyone else have an opinion on this? I&#39;m curious in part because it could be argued that <i>MST3K</i> informed quite a bit of the PPC. We may not be doing straight up MSTies most of the time, but the old pattern is still there.<br><br>Also, the official MST3K YouTube channel is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFzph9x-n9FR52BI94Zfgww">here</a> if you want a sampling of what the original show was about.</p>

            <p>Calling the community&#39;s attention: after <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=287337;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board;pagemark=25">this discussion</a>, it seems that we have a new method of designating new Legendary Badfic. What do you guys think? <i>Should</i> we designate new Legendary Badfic? Is the method detailed below a good one? If not (and assuming we do want to designate new Legendaries), is there a better one?<br><br>THE METHOD (summarised from what hS and Nesh said):<br>A fic is considered Legendary when:<br>-It gets a decent amount of google hits — it&#39;s an indicator that people are talking about the fic.<br>-Those hits are not because of a PPC mission.<br>-The fic is famous by its own right, not because of the author/sequel/prequel/fanart/whatever.<br>-A majority of PPCers agrees that it is bad.</p>

            <p>Instead of just &#39;google hits&#39;, I suggest the following:<br><br>-It is at least five years old. (This could be cut down to 3, but I think 5 is better.)<br>-It gets a decent amount of Google hits <b>from the past year</b>. (<a href="https://www.google.co.uk/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=blood+raining+night&amp;safe=off&amp;tbs=qdr:y&amp;start=10">example</a>)<br><br>I think this will make sure that the stories that get in have actually attained legendary status, rather than just being a momentary fad, as it were. It&#39;s the difference between whatever meme was massively trending this time last year - and &#39;All your base are belong to us&#39;.

            <p>I propose that <i>My Inner Life</i> should be Legendary.

(WARNING!

Bad biology abounds here, including Makoto somehow managing to shove all FOUR of her limbs inside the poor little girl&#39;s private parts. And by the end of this atrocity, Chibiusa has basically become a sex zombie. </p>

            <p>That story appears to occupy every single one of the 500+ hits it gets.

            <p>Teh Bad Fic is so much more than &#39;squick for squick&#39;s sake&#39; - the writer clearly had an actual story they wanted to tell.

The boy was smart enough to upload me into his brain, in case the circuits ever overhead. Like now, for example. Cipher usually has very high resistance to badfics, but things like that are abound to happen sometimes. Don&#39;t worry, I have already launched the reboot program, so we should be getting him back soon. In the meantime, let me explain:<br><br>James&#39; summary wasn&#39;t enough, so Cipher decided to check the Badfic Candidate himself. Although he barely knew <i>Sailor Moon</i> canon (Last time he watched it he was eight). The first problem our systems noted at the very beginning, with the &#39;disclaimer&#39;:<br><br>&quot;<i>Feel free to read this if you’re a minor, though, people under 18should be able to have fun too!</i>&quot;<br><br>Clearly Cipher and the &#39;Author&#39; have different defitions of fun... moving on! The rest of the reading went something like this<br><br><img src="http://www.therobotsvoice.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/toht-face-melting2.jpg"><br><br>And now you see, oh... looks like the reboot is complete and Cipher is coming back. In that case, I bid everyone au revoir!<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br><br>Ugh, what the heck happened? My head... Ah, right! <i>Chibiusa&#39;s seventh birthday</i>, huh?

            <p>I think the thing to remember is that we&#39;re not trying to make an exhaust<s>ing</s>ive list of everything that meets the criteria. What this is about is dealing with the situation where newbie boarder Lacksidacksical bounces in and says &#39;I&#39;ve just read this <i>super awful</i> badfic, and I think it should be Legendary! (And also I claim it for when I get Permission and I need sixteen cowriters!)&#39; Previously, the response to that has always been, basically, &#39;I&#39;ve never heard of it&#39; (to which the reaction is &#39;well, <i>I</i> have&#39;).<br><br>Having a definition like this means that the Board can look at Lacksi&#39;s offering and say &#39;yeah... that doesn&#39;t produce a single Google hit related to it&#39;. Or, alternately, when OlderThanThou pipes in with &#39;it can&#39;t possibly be legendary because I&#39;d know it if it was&#39;, Lacksi can point at the Googling and so forth and say &#39;yah-<i>huh</i> it is <i>too</i>&#39;.<br><br>Which is very rude and she&#39;ll get told off, but her point still stands. ^_~<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>It&#39;s less than two weeks before Christmas, and I&#39;m in a good mood from finishing my last giant history paper, so let&#39;s get this game started! No Permission necessary, just a sense of humor, a vaguely musical ear, and a love of Christmas/Hanukkah/Kwanzaa/winter holiday songs.<br><br>Here&#39;s how the game works: <br>1. Pick a seasonal tune that strikes your fancy—anything you like, even if it&#39;s been used for this before.<br>2. Write new words for it with a PPC theme.<br>2a. As usual, Neshomeh (who has given me her blessing) encourages you to seek for a topic that does not involve Sue-slaying, because we have lots of filks about that. If that&#39;s what the muse dictates, though, go for it.<br>3. Post your filk here in this thread for us to enjoy and comment on.<br>4. If so inclined, share a recording of yourself singing a filk or two.<br>5. When all&#39;s said, sung, and done, Neshomeh will add this year&#39;s entries to the <a href="http://starshadowhall.tripod.com/ppc/songbook/">PPC Holiday Songbook</a> unless you specify otherwise.<br><br>Let the caroling begin!</p>

            <p>If it helps you appreaciating the song there is no problem. And the melancholy of the tune is needed, given the fact this soundtrack is playing after a really nasty boss is destroyed, your time with your new friends is growing short and while you&#39;re waiting infos in order to find another character who disappeared only a few days ago, so melancholy is a given.</p>

            <p>I would have to mention that a Persona 4 badfic that was reported by Hardric a while ago. Here are some of the urplest passages:<br><br>&quot;The sky rippled a beautiful red and black, but it wasn&#39;t reachable. It was the only thing the fog couldn&#39;t touch- and naturally, if it couldn&#39;t reach it, then I certainly couldn&#39;t. The fog was ubiquitous. It was my reality to wander the infinite fogbank.<br><br>The world was sky and fog and shadows; eternal and immutable. Against infinity, a moment is useless. That was why I didn&#39;t keep memories. This was a world where nothing worth preserving happened; there was no growth, no change. Stagnation defined this worthless realm, an eternity of perpetual peace drowned in the fog.&quot;<br><br>&quot;...Human faces that stared out of the inky shadows of the world.<br><br>I heard a cry of grief; a wailing dirge from the uncountable to a single extinguished life that pieced my chest with empathetic heat. I was being ripped apart, parts of me that I never knew existed pulled in opposite extremes-&quot; <br><br>&quot;This place was at peace, I realized. That was why it was so terrifying. This was a place that had decided entirely what it was to be for all eternity, and would resist all change to that end. Time would not flow here. The fog would not lift. <br><br>It was the most permanent sort of mask. A seal never to be broken.&quot;  <br><br></p>

            <p>Right now, it&#39;s only 2 days until <i>The Force Awakens</i> hits the screens, so I&#39;ve decided to tackle a certain theory.<br><br>Answer me, friends, what are we missing from all of the promos and trailes for Episode VII?

If you want to know exactly what the agents of the PPC are watching on their consoles (while, no doubt, claiming to be &#39;writing their reports&#39;), this is how you find out!<br><br>The previous schedule is <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qnzbsuTymINHw4oQOrXRIMHgRIiHEIgM-mHQUY2a3rs/pub">here</a>.<br><br>And... I&#39;ve finished giving my website a massive revamp. <i>All</i> my fanfic-related work is now accessed through <a href="http://huinesoron.webs.com/Fanfic/index.htm">this new, very Plorty hub-page</a>; this means that the old PPC menu page has been superceded (though it&#39;s still up, for link-preservation purposes). And... yeah, apparently I (and Baron hS, for that matter) have a lot of stuff going on.<br><br>There is some new material hidden in there... the <a href="http://huinesoron.webs.com/Fanfic/index.htm">datafiles</a> sub-page has new timelines/reading lists for Dafydd and Constance (and if you want me to make one for a specific agent, speak up and I&#39;ll try!); the <a href="http://huinesoron.webs.com/Fanfic/Oddlots.htm">Oddlots backup</a> has a set of essays from P@L; I&#39;m not sure I&#39;ve ever officially mentioned the <a href="http://ppchistory.webs.com/misssandman/index.htm">Misssandman.com backup</a> either, though most of that is still dead links (the PPC sub-site is mostly there, though).

            <p>&quot;New NTV schedule&#39;s up.&quot;<br><br>Laura looked up from the disassembled rifle scattered across the table in front of her. &quot;How much of it is <i>Lord of the Rings</i> themed?&quot; she asked.<br><br>James tapped on the link before swiping his fingers a few times across his tablet screen. &quot;Counting Nutmint?&quot; he asked.<br><br>&quot;Yeah, counting that.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Eh… over a third, I&#39;d say.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Hah!&quot; Laura clenched her artificial fist in triumph. &quot;Told you so. You own me five bucks. Any video game related stuff?&quot; <br><br>James sighed and shook his head as he continued to skim through the schedule. <br><br>Laura was emitting smugness the same way uranium gives off radiation. &quot;Two for two! That&#39;s ten bucks you owe me now.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I suppose so,&quot; James said, slightly sour. &quot;They do have something about the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The upcoming <i>Star Wars</i> movie, too.&quot; <br><br>&quot;Really? Huh. Must&#39;ve gotten a newbie. You know, someone who joined the PPC within the last decade.&quot; Laura returned her attention to the piecemeal weapon. &quot;Thank God for alternative streaming options.&quot;<br><br>~~~~~<br><br>It&#39;s all meant in good fun. The schedule is a nice way to get a look at a bit more of the PPC as a world, even if it is somewhat repetitive. I like the new look of your website. Very creative, very colorful. I&#39;m also a big fan of the new timelines; they&#39;re very nifty.</p>

            <p>You&#39;re right, there&#39;s some heavy bias in there - but all that proves is that Undis Closed is a Middle-earth fan (gosh, I wonder why...).

            <p>&quot;Augh, we&#39;re wasting our time!&quot;<br><br>Legolas looked back at his friend with a fond smile. &quot;The White Lady doesn&#39;t think so. Prince Faramir doesn&#39;t think so.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Well, what do they know?&quot; Gimli hauled himself over another boulder with a grunt. &quot;All this talk of stars moving and falling - this is for the likes of elves, not dwarves and men.&quot; He grinned at Legolas&#39; affronted expression. &quot;No offence.&quot;<br><br>&quot;My people <i>have</i> noticed it too,&quot; Legolas said. He glanced down the rocky slope towards the woods of Ithilien, as if he could see the Silvan folk who now called them home - and perhaps he could, even at that distance. &quot;Each night a new star crosses the sky, passing by the moon twice every two hours. And the fire that fell from above-&quot;<br><br>&quot;Just more of the Fiery Mountain&#39;s rumblings,&quot; Grimli grumbled. &quot;Expecting an elf to recognise the workings of the earth is like asking a dwarf about-&quot;<br><br>&quot;- stars?&quot; Legolas stopped abruptly, cocking his head. &quot;Something draws near,&quot; he said, his voice dropping to a whisper. &quot;And we are right on the cusp of Imlad Morgul...&quot;<br><br>Gimli unslung his axe from his back and gripped it tightly. &quot;Whatever comes out of there,&quot; he whispered back, &quot;we can handle it.&quot;<br><br>Legolas had an arrow nocked, his gaze slowly sweeping the boulder-field. &quot;There,&quot; he murmured, &quot;beside the river. I see a hand... yes, show yourself.&quot; Suddenly he straightened up, lowering his bow and staring.<br><br>&quot;What?&quot; Gimli squinted into the distance. &quot;Tell me what you see!&quot;<br><br>&quot;A woman,&quot; Legolas said, his voice tinged with bewilderment. &quot;Mortal, by her face. Her hair is fair, and her clothes are strange...&quot; He shook off his confusion and leapt up onto the boulder in front of him, then darted off.<br><br>Gimli watched his friend leap from rock to rock, seeming almost to fly between them. &quot;Elves!&quot; he grunted, and set off after him.<br><br>~<br><br>Gimli trudged along behind Legolas, his head filled with suspicious thoughts. The woman was strange indeed - she seemed to speak no known tongue, and had neither pack nor weapon, even on the edge of the Morgul vale. By the time Gimli caught up, she had already convinced Legolas - by way of hand gestures - to accompany her back towards the ruined nightmare city, and none of Gimli&#39;s protests could sway the elf.<br><br>&quot;She is in need of assistance,&quot; Legolas insisted. &quot;I do not take her for a phantom of the Enemy, if such things even still walk this earth; she is, I feel sure, precisely as she seems.&quot;<br><br>&quot;That&#39;s what I&#39;m worried about.&quot; But with no concrete concerns, Gimli had no choice but to follow - after all, he reasoned, <i>someone</i> had to protect the elf when his good nature got him into trouble.<br><br>At least the woman seemed to have no intention of taking them directly to the fallen city: the party swung south, heading deeper into the haunted valley. As they travelled, Gimli began to notice something: the twisted trees which grew in the Morgul vale seemed to be almost scorched, as if a great fire had swept over them. He was about to say something to Legolas when they came to the ridge.<br><br>Before them, the land dropped sharply away, into a great bowl carved out of the loam of Ithilien. This was no natural depression: the earth had been blasted apart by fires far greater than those employed by Saruman at the Hornburg. The plants all around were thrown flat to the ground, tree trunks splintered and broken. At the base of the hollow Gimli saw bare rock - and <i>something</i> that lay crumpled upon it.<br><br>It could almost have been a house, toppled onto its side - if, as Gimli noted later, one were entirely blind. The structure was made of metal, and from its four sides great butresses in red and yellow sprung out. But even without knowing its nature, it was clearly damaged - one of the butresses lay twisted and broken on the ground, and the gleaming metal of the central structure was pitted and scarred.<br><br>Legolas and Gimli stared at it for a long time, as their guide waited impatiently beside them. Finally, Gimli broke the silence. &quot;I take it all back,&quot; he said, looking up at his friend. &quot;This... is <i>not</i> from the fiery mountain.&quot;<br><br>~<br><br>The structure contained only more mysteries: metal chairs, doors that had neither hinge nor handle, a statue of crystal and iron in the shape of a man. And there was another mortal, injured and unconscious. From the way the woman fussed over him, it was clear they were close.<br><br>Legolas did his best to tend the man&#39;s wounds. &quot;If we can bear him to Emyn Arnen, the White Lady could do more,&quot; he mused. &quot;But will his companion permit it?&quot;<br><br>&quot;She will if she wants him to live,&quot; Gimli said. &quot;You&#39;ve seen her face - she knows how grievous his wounds are. It must have been the need for assistance that led her onto our path.&quot;<br><br>Legolas nodded. &quot;And yet... if I could but speak to her!&quot; He reached out and touched the metal wall beside him. &quot;I do not claim to understand this, but I think it is like the ship of Earendil - a star-traveller, brought here by mischance.&quot; He shook his head slowly. &quot;If I am right, it is hardly a mystery that she speaks no tongue of Middle-earth.&quot;<br><br>Gimli opened his mouth to speak - and then froze, staring out through the great window that made up one wall of the metal room. &quot;Legolas,&quot; he said, his voice hoarse. &quot;There... there is a star, falling...&quot;<br><br>The new light burned in the sky, casting harsh shadows across the valley. It grew brighter than the moon, bright enough that Gimli had to avert his gaze. A roaring sound, as of tumbling waters in the deep places of Khazad-Dum, filled his ears.<br><br>The noise stopped. The light faded. And out in the scoured-clean hollow, where there had been only rock and earth, something new stood: a great tower, as red as blood, its side carved with vast white runes in some unfamiliar curving script.<br><br>Gimli swallowed, his throat dry and tight. &quot;I think,&quot; he said, &quot;we may be in over our heads.&quot;<br><br>~<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>... that while I can write Legolas and Gimli, and even Alan Tracy, it&#39;s been a <i>very</i> long time since I saw <i>Fireball XL5</i>. I knocked Steve Zodiac and Robert the Robot over the head and stuck Dr Venus with no compatible language mostly because I haven&#39;t the faintest idea what they&#39;re like. (Though I think there&#39;s eposides available on the Wayback machine for some reason...)<br><br>Also: I don&#39;t know where it&#39;d go next. International Rescue don&#39;t traditionally care about machines, so would Alan just take the crew home, leaving Fireball Jr. crashed in the Morgul vale? But that&#39;s not much of a story.

            <p>One thing to note about <i>Thunderbirds</i> is that Gerry Anderson didn&#39;t want his heroes to have guns -- a fairly common theme among people who survived our end of WWII, with Patrick Macnee being a classic example of that in a live-action format. If Legolas and Gimli spirited away with Venus and Steve (ain&#39;t no way they&#39;re taking Robert) before either Alan, John, or Scott could get to them, things might get a bit more interesting. You could get a really good adventure yarn out of that, with the relevant Tracy and a kinda-sorta repaired Robert yomping through rural Gondor doing good deeds and so on while Steve and Venus deal with something in Emyn Arnen. Perhaps Elboron has been brought low with some sickness or other... or perhaps something from the XL5&#39;s nutomic reactor has got into the local ecosystem.<br><br>Hell, you could even incorporate something sinister going on in Ithilien, with the Cult of the New Shadow in full swing... though perhaps they have a new master, secreted away in the steaming jungles of Far Harad, standing in a temple built by his most ardent followers, a man with a hypnotic presence...<br><br>But that&#39;s just idle speculation. =]</p>

            <p>As far as I know, not all sues are human, and those that are tend to be consumed by things that aren&#39;t. Like vampires. Not that sues even really count as people, so I&#39;m not even sure you could call it cannibalism if a human agent ate a human sue. After all, humans typically don&#39;t have glitter in their veins.<br><br>Since sues are biologically vastly different than humans, I think it&#39;s safe to say that only a reformed sue eating another sue could be called (guiltless) cannibalism, and even then they&#39;d have to be the same species for it to count.</p>

            <p>is more because there aren&#39;t any other (known to be) sapient species in real life.  Most fantasy settings that contain a larger array of sapient species define cannibalism more liberally.  Usually it&#39;s used to refer to eating another sapient, or sometimes humanoid, being. For example, in Pathfinder it is still considered cannibalism (and an evil act that will get you promptly expelled from, say, the Pathfinder Society) if an orc eats an elf or human.  Similarly, in World of Warcraft, the Forsaken&#39;s Cannibalize ability works on any humanoid or undead corpse, despite the fact that Forsaken could technically be said to be more closely related to an Azeroth-native primate than to a draenei. <br><br>Mary Sues, on the other hand, seem to be permitted under the argument that, given how poorly-written they are, they aren&#39;t fully sapient.  Eating them isn&#39;t cannibalism for the same reason that killing them isn&#39;t murder.  While that&#39;s the official PPC stance on the issue, however, I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if more than a few agents disagree, especially those who don&#39;t go out in the field.  It&#39;s one thing to know on an intellectual level that a Sue isn&#39;t really &quot;human&quot; - it&#39;s another thing to know it on an emotional level.  You&#39;re still eating something that <i>looks</i> like a person, and that&#39;s uncomfortably close to eating a person for most tastes.</p>

            <p>But I certainly see your point, and I never meant to imply that agents wouldn&#39;t have their own views on the matter. I&#39;m more just pointing out the textbook definition because, in my field, the devil is in the details. That&#39;s all.<br><br>But, yes, in any case, Mary Sues are non-sapient. This, combined with the fact that some agents are literal maneaters, means that HQ would probably not consider it cannibalism to eat a Mary Sue. After all, I doubt they&#39;d want to cut off a vampire&#39;s food supply.</p>

            <p>&quot;<i>Mary Sues are not real people, so killing them is not murder. Some agents may even eat Sues (see Sue Soufflй) or drink their blood, though most find the very idea to be revolting.</i>&quot;<br><br>And cannibalism, by definition, is &#39;the act or practice of humans eating the flesh or internal organs of other human beings.&#39;<br><br>In my opinion, no. It doesn&#39;t count as cannibalism, although it may borderline it, if you enjoy the taste.</p>

            <p>I just brought in a character who I already had who had been sitting collecting dust because his story had been abandoned. For his partner, I made a deliberate non-character. I decided to take someone from a story with plenty of plot holes, who had just been glimpsed for a second and had no personality of his own, and assign a personality to him.</p>

            <p>But I can tell you what I did with my agents.<br><br>-Des is a self-insert with a twist. The question here is, &quot;how would I look like if I lived in a different world and took one significant different turn?&quot;<br>-Anebrin was <i>supposed</i> to be a counterpoint to Des, but I&#39;m not sure I managed to do any of that. One of the reasons I wrote him out of my spinoff (sans a possibility of showing up in Ispace, maybe) is because I figured he&#39;s flat and I have no idea how to make him three-dimensional.<br>-The Librarian began his life as a joke; hS (if I am not mistaken) posted a thread asking &quot;what would be your Renegade Time Lord name?&quot; Somewhere along the line, Lump evolved from &quot;Time Lord!me&quot; to this amalgamation of all of my less-than-stellar traits mixed with a hefty dose of racism. Of course, [spoilers] is going to [spoilers] — hopefully we&#39;ll publish it <a href="http://ddesire.cncguild.net/extra/mo_images/momeme_soon.jpg">soon</a>.<br>-Navare is a recruited bit. What&#39;s happening to him is actually quite similar to what Nesh described &amp;mdassh; I&#39;m trying to take the little characterisation he got in his horrible home fic and extrapolate a three-dimensional character from it.<br>-Amris is, if you&#39;ll pardon my Tropense, is the <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedOniBlueOni">Red, <s>slightly</s> deranged Oni to Navare&#39;s Blue.</a> I imagine the Marquis de Sod put it with Navare because Navare can keep it in check, and might prove to be a stabilising influence on the &quot;something went wrong when they made it&quot; part of its personality.

            <p>I checked Martinoz&#39;s Let&#39;s Play of 3.0 BR1 after that, and I dig up my old Red Alert 2 game for this mod. I think I mentionned this mod when I presented myself to the Board. Right now, my favourites are the Latin Confederation (the Catastrophe is perfect), and the European Alliance. I&#39;m also vey curious about this fourth cyber faction, who seems to be based upon Pacific Front renegades if I&#39;m getting the clues right.</p>

            <p>To be honest, I don&#39;t remember how I discovered MO. Faction-wise I prefer the Pacific Front. I have no feelings about the fourth faction — I&#39;d rather wait and see what is it like than form a premature opinion.</p>

            <p>...is to take an original character of yours (whether for original fiction or fanfiction) and recruit them. I&#39;ve both done this and seen it done. In the PPC at large there are recovering Sues, characters from semi-fic blips, characters from original fiction, and, I expect, characters from published fanfics. In my own work... while most of my agents do not fit this pattern, at least two of them do: Flash, who I&#39;m not sure has gotten an appearance yet (except possibly in an rp?), is one of a cast of main characters in an original book I&#39;ve been writing for a while, and, of course, the Reader, who hails from a DW screenplay fanfic I wrote back in 2011 for the now canceled ScriptFrenzy (NaNoWriMo&#39;s team used to run it, and the general idea was to write a 100-page screenplay in April. They closed it a year or several after I did it, and it hasn&#39;t been back, although there&#39;s certainly nothing stopping anyone from writing screenplays for their other events.)<br><br>Beyond that, though, I&#39;m pretty sure most of my characters were created for the PPC (using a workshop of PC&#39;s, in one case, though her appearance is still very much in the works), or else (in a few cases) were rescues. But yeah, recruiting your own fanfic or original fiction characters can work as well.<br><br>~DF, who is not usually up this early but is only just now beginning to regret it a little</p>

            <p>In preparation for a new project, I&#39;ve had to come up with a whole slate of new characters - I need a cast of 14 (!!!), and only two of them are pre-existing. So I&#39;ve had ample opportunity to observe exactly how I invent them!<br><br>What I&#39;ve discovered is that my characters tend to come into existence not as a single idea, but by the combination of <i>two</i>. These ideas tend to be:<br><br>-Species/origin.<br>-Personality.<br>-Role in the PPC.<br>-Backstory.<br><br>So, for instance, one character is a <i>Thomas the Tank Engine</i> train. That&#39;s idea number one, but it doesn&#39;t inform an entire character. Combine that with a job description that keeps it in one place the whole time, though, and a character starts to come together: one who&#39;s dedicated enough to keep working on the same thing even though their entire life is contained in a single loop of track, and who is probably a little <i>too</i> geeky.<br><br>Another pair of characters came together from the manner of their arrival in the PPC, and the fact that they are two members of the same group of friends, but never really got on themselves - but are now stuck working together. I don&#39;t yet know the precise details of their personality conflict - I suspect that the first lines of their story will give me one, and the other will grow to bounce off them - but I have the clay I need to start with.<br><br>Know what&#39;s entirely missing from this, though? Things like the following:<br><br>-Name.<br>-Sex and gender.<br>-Appearance.<br><br>Those are pretty much the last things that need to be stuck on a character. At the moment, only three of my characters have genders - two of them are the preexisting ones, and the third is a fictionalised historical person. Two of those are the only ones with names. I have <i>no</i> idea what the ones outside that trio look like. At least one doesn&#39;t even have a species assigned yet!<br><br>Because those things... really are unimportant, despite the fact that people think of them as the first thing they need. If you asked me to write Dafydd Illian as a warty-skinned squat alien named Kzarth (who belongs to the fourth sex of yer species, which has seven), I could do that easily: the essential &#39;utterly convinced of yer own superiority, but <i>not</i> that of yer people necessarily&#39; would be easy to pull through. But ask me to write the tall son of Feanor Dafydd Illian as a shy introvert? I couldn&#39;t do it; I&#39;d be writing a completely different character.<br><br>Your agent already has one idea: they need to be a partner to your other one. Find a second idea. Maybe there&#39;s a species [&quot;NOT TIME LORD!&quot; ~ Morgan] you always wanted to play with. Maybe you can find them a backstory in the PPC - perhaps they used to work in a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pHfubKjf6k9l9MZAfFpacN9pjtnxkhI96C1AqUNBIL4/pub">defunct department</a>, or they&#39;ve just transferred from Infrastructure to Action, or they were involved in the Macrovirus epidemic and have had intense germophobia ever since. Maybe (because there are exceptions to every rule) you can come up with a name that means things in half a dozen languages, and want to make a running joke out of that. All of these things can inform and plant the seed of a personality.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I was going by the whole &#39;opposite personalities get assigned as partners&#39; deal, so I first looked at my existing agent. Rina was brash, loud, and bratty. Zeb, therefore, was going to be timid, quiet, and a very sweet person. Bing bang boom, general character traits were ready to go. All that was left were tweaking the personality and making it more three-dimensional. I did this by considering his backstory.<br><br>I am a big believer in that the &#39;why&#39;s are just as important as the &#39;what&#39;s, since that helps me get a better feel for my characters and think about how they react in certain situations. For example, <i>why</i> was Zeb timid and quiet? Since I was in a bit of a Nuzlocke phase at the time, I decided he was going to be a Pokйmon. He was a seasoned fighter (being a Pokйmon), so getting sent to the DMS made sense, and he had reasons for his timidness (coming from a Nuzlocke game). This told me he&#39;d have the capacity for bravery when needed; his character was going to be more &#39;cowardly lion&#39; than just straight-up &#39;coward&#39;. I wouldn&#39;t have arrived at this conclusion without knowing the cause for his personality traits, hence why I think backstory should play at least a part in deciding characterization.<br><br>-Iximaz, who should really be asleep right now and probably will think she made this post drunk when she wakes up tomorrow</p>

            <p>Especially because almost every single one of my PPC characters was rescued from a badfic, either actual or imaginary.<br><br>If that approach doesn&#39;t suit you, though, you could always try dredging up old OCs and seeing if you could create stronger characterization for them. That approach is what I did with Falchion, Rashida, and to some extent, Lapis (who wasn&#39;t technically rescued in a mission, since I wrote that I ditched her homefic before anyone could spork it).<br><br>Or you could just pick a random concept you think would be suitable and go nuts like I did with Whitney.

            <p>Three of my four action agents are former bit characters.

            <p>I created a handful of FicPsych nurses on the basis of funny names and messing around with TekTek Dream Avatar. Then I stuck the two together and began to ask myself <i>why</i> these people had such funny names and looked the way they did.<br><br>Big hair, coke-bottle glasses, and a sweater? Jewish ancestry; near-sighted in personality as in vision; a little fussy and uptight.<br><br>&quot;Pablum&quot; sounds vaguely Scandinavian, and I found this funny pacifier necklace thing on TekTek. Call him Jann and make him a big yet soft-spoken Norwegian guy. FicPsych needs muscle.<br><br>Where else do you get a name like &quot;Loquacious&quot; except on the Disc? She looks happy; make her a bubbly Pinkie Pie type. She&#39;d never survive in Ankh-Morpork; probably explains why she&#39;s here.<br><br>Need someone to say something about macroviruses. Let&#39;s have a <i>Star Trek</i> counselor! ... Huh, looks like I never specified their gender in the story. Let&#39;s make that a thing!<br><br>Et cetera. As per PC&#39;s workshop, they develop and grow the more I write about them (except the first two, who ended up as cannon fodder). The random starting traits I gave them act as sort of a trellis for their personalities to grow on.<br><br>Even Nume kinda started out that way. He began life with no description on purpose, but the more I wrote about him and his partner in &quot;Fill the Plothole&quot; games, the more I found out about them, and eventually they became real characters. It just sorta happened. The entire reason he has green glasses is TekTek, though. I spotted them and thought it was cool that green was an option. Ergo, Nume&#39;s favorite color is green. *shrug*<br><br>I don&#39;t quite remember how the eidetic memory/Bleep dependency came about, but it may have been the result of him being the one to lose a bottle of Bleeprin in Thranduil&#39;s halls in his very first appearance. Plus me thinking to myself &quot;lol, wouldn&#39;t it be funny if an agent could never forget anything and needed Bleep just to be normal?&quot; There was a certain impulse toward writing a Dr. House-ish lovable jerkass involved, too.<br><br>Things just kinda snowball in my head like that.<br><br>I do want to highlight that this is <b>completely backwards</b>, though. It seems to work for me, but I do have to put in the work of digging into the whys and hows to make order from the chaos, and there is a reason why we generally advise people NOT to create characters on the basis of &quot;lol, wouldn&#39;t it be cool/funny/wacky if...?&quot;<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>That&#39;s actually what ended up happening with the BM crew- I wanted to have some more characters to play July and Library off of (primarily Library) and I introduced Denny first, with a very vague idea of what to do with him and his characterization. <br><br>And then I thought about it more going &#39;well, who does <i>he</i> work with?&#39; and then it snowballed from there with the whole crew getting names, then personalities, and backstories and now short stories I&#39;m working on in very occasional spare time along with everything else.<br><br>It is more complex because you have to work out the reasons why they&#39;re like that in the first place, and you can get pretty tangled up doing it! <br><br>It can be super fun, though.<br><br>On the other hand, Agent July&#39;s my self insert, and then I made it more confusing by adding in *another* old SI/avatar of mine from when I was younger and more obnoxious on the internet, and then Library was a minorish-plot point in a story I&#39;ve been working on for years, so I already had an idea about what was going on with her.<br><br>Both ways work, just depends on what you&#39;re doing and for what purpose. <br><br>-July</p>

            <p>Sometimes (Algie is a prime example of this) characters pop fully-formed into my head at some point during an RP and I have to write them down before they escape. Most of the time, however, this is not so, and while it&#39;s generally speaking a bad idea to start from a &quot;wouldn&#39;t it be X if&quot; standpoint, I&#39;ve been known to make it at least vaguely work.<br><br>Case in point, my most famous agent: The Notary. She&#39;s a bit of both, having been invented entirely so I could take part in a Board event called the Continuity Council of Gallifrey-In-Exile. Rather than make yet another renegade Time Lord, I wanted one who was the epitome of everything wrong with Time Lord civilization: a malevolent, vicious, spiteful, petty-minded bureaucrat convinced of her own self-worth. The Notary&#39;s character and backstory grew and grew as the RP wore on until she became the character we know and kind of tolerate today.<br><br>Teaming her with Wobbles was deliberate on my part too. It was my attempt to do something a bit more interesting with the prevailing agent dynamic while still fitting the two-power rule. One&#39;s an introvert, one&#39;s an extrovert, one&#39;s the funny guy, one&#39;s the straight man, but it&#39;s filtered through a certain amount of cynicism. Wobbles is a completely unironic happy clown, except she&#39;s only like that because she&#39;s a disabled angstfic blip and likely an emotional cripple. The Notary is just the worst lifeform in the history of ever, but her past self was a full-on heroic Time Lord in the universe-saving business and she remembers what it&#39;s like and what her hatred gets her.<br><br>But they both started from the point of view of &quot;wouldn&#39;t it be funny if the agents were a sulky bureaucrat and a literal clown?&quot;<br><br>So it can work. You just have to think about it a little more than normal. =]</p>

            <p><b>Agents:</b>  The fact that Meg &quot;pushed the boundaries on what constitutes ‘torture’ once or twice&quot; sent up a red flag for me, but as long as you don&#39;t go overboard with her and see to it that any inappropriate behavior has proper consequences, I <i>think</i> you should be fine there.<br><br><b>SPaG:</b> Looks good. Thumbs up. Not much else to say here, move along.<br><br><b>Prompts:</b> First one looks good. I was entertained, and I got a feel for the agents&#39; characters. The second one was good in the same way, but there was some stuff that I didn&#39;t like too much. See below.<br><br><b>PPC Knowledge:</b> Why was Meg, who was close to going crazy on everyone to the point where a nurse tried to tase her and she had to be sent to FicPsych, allowed to have visitors? That&#39;s a major safety hazard to both parties, and even if you were going by the rationalization that &#39;she&#39;d help her calm down&#39;, the nurses wouldn&#39;t want to risk it because of the sheer unpredictability of what might happen. I&#39;m not even going to go into how incredibly calm the nurse was about crazy-Meg escaping from her cell, never mind how she did that in the first place. Come on, HQ gets much crazier agents needing to be restrained; those cells would be pretty hard to break out of.<br><br>A few more points: I&#39;d need hS to comment, but I&#39;m pretty sure that Constance Simms was just a FicPsych nurse, never a patient. Then there&#39;s this &quot;door to HQ&quot; located in Switzerland. That&#39;s not to say HQ <i>can&#39;t</i> have other access points besides New Caledonia, but for the sake of requesting Permission it would probably be better to stick to established canon to show you know your stuff. I&#39;m also going to flag the note about how Meg &quot;can usually be found wearing either the department jumpsuit&quot;. The PPC doesn&#39;t really have a uniform; aside from early mentions in TOS and maybe some other spinoffs, it seems to have become &#39;whatever the agents want to wear, as long as it involves black and has the flash patch somewhere&#39;.<br><br>So, I&#39;m going to have to say <b>Permission Denied</b>, but just barely. Everything else looks great; just make sure you&#39;ve got your PPC knowledge straight next time and you&#39;ll be golden.</p>

            <p>Mention of torture is gone, Constance is now just referenced as &quot;a woman&quot;, no mention of a jumpsuit, the door&#39;s been changed to New Caledonia, and the entire FicPsych thing looks like it&#39;s been changed. There&#39;s probably other stuff I&#39;m missing, but yeah.<br><br>The Wiki&#39;s not giving me any information on visitation policies and I don&#39;t recall reading any spinoffs where agents try to visit their snapped partners in in-patient wards, so the bit about safety came down to a combination of common sense and personal experience. I don&#39;t really feel like going into details, but I have seen what happens when a kid snaps to the point where they would be kicking, screaming, biting, and the like, so much that just holding them wouldn&#39;t be enough; they&#39;d be locked in a padded room and nobody would be allowed to even go near the door in case it set them off again. There was one boy who managed to break his own wrist even in the padded room and when the nurses finally went in because it looked like he&#39;d calmed down, they got attacked. So yeah, even if they look like they&#39;ve calmed down... you never know.<br><br>So, since agents who snap are likely a lot more dangerous...yeah, allowing visitors for raging agents seems like it would be a huge no-no.</p>

            <p>I think they probably call them &quot;subjects.&quot; Just spitballing here, but their primary aim is research <s>and experimentation</s> on Suvians—mostly the vapid glitterball sort, AFAIK—so I don&#39;t imagine they&#39;re too keen on letting people in.

            <p>Obviously, I&#39;m unable to comment on any specific cases of Suvians under the &#39;care&#39; of the DMSE&amp;R, in or out of partnership with Medical. But <i>speaking in general</i>, I&#39;d like to observe that there are three categories of Mary Sue.<br><br><i>Four. ~Penny Smith, DMSE&amp;R</i><br><br>All right, five. And - again in general - the effaciacy of treatment depends on the Suvian type in question.<br><br>1. First up, we have Suvians produced by the League - probably the most common variety. These <i>can</i> be drained of their glitter, but it is rarely worthwhile: their glitterless state is to be a blank nothingness, very similar to a crash test dummy. They show no personality outside that created by their story. They are not really people. Their genome literally spells out what they are supposed to-<br><br><i>Niamh, you&#39;re rambling. ~Penny</i><br><br>2. Secondly, there is the comparatively uncommon natural Suvian species. These have a low natural glitter level, but it <i>is</i> low - the League pumps their Sues full of the stuff. A natural Suvian can be trained to supress their Suvian instincts; many of the PPC&#39;s ex-Sues are natural.<br><br>3. Trained Suvians, created from fangirls. Under the Ispace Accords, these unfortunates are strictly outside the PPC&#39;s jurisdiction; they are fairly easy to redeem, though, since their Sueishness comes from indoctrination. Agent Penny believes that they are infused with glitter by their teachers, but when all you have is a centrifuge, I suppose everything looks like blood.<br><br><i>Hey!</i><br><br>At least I didn&#39;t say &#39;when all you have is training as an assassin...&#39;.<br><br><i><b>Hey!</b></i><br><br>4. Possessed Suvians. These are usually (but not always) canon characters possessed by a wraith; liberating them is as simple as exorcising the spirit.<br><br>5. Artificial Suvians, created by infusing ordinary people with glitter. There are several diseases found in HQ which have this effect. Some of them are simple to cure, others are very difficult.<br><br>This whole picture is complicated by the fact that the genus <i>Puella</i> has traditionally been applied to <i>all</i> forms of Suvian. As the description above shows, one category (3) is strictly <i>H. sapiens</i>, while another (1) can be argued to not be a species at all. Sue-wraiths should be a clade in themselves, and-<br><br><i>Niamh, enough; we all know you&#39;ve got a new cladistic chart planned. What was your actual point here? ~Penny</i><br><br>Oh, that. Um, if we&#39;re involved in &#39;caring for&#39; a Suvian, it&#39;s probably of type 2 or 5; type 1 is irredemable, type 3 has been handed over to the Redemption Academy, and type 4 should&#39;ve been dealt with by the agent on the ground.<br><br>But I&#39;m not saying whether we are or not.<br><br>=Dr. Niamh, Department of Mary Sue Experiments and Research=<br><br><hr>
<br><br>So, Niamh. Lily Winterwood has apparently designated her as Vietnamese - but only in an unpublished story dating back to 2008. Given that she has an Irish name and was seen with blonde hair back in 200<b>4</b>, should a statement on the Wiki with only an unpublished source (for an agent who wasn&#39;t originally created by the person who sourced it) be considered binding?<br><br>I <i>can</i> try and come up with an explanation, but I don&#39;t know if I <i>should</i>.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>... there <i>have</i> been visitors to FicPsych&#39;d agents before, but I can&#39;t come up with any examples. I don&#39;t know what the sample originally looked like, but if it had the same &#39;yeah, she&#39;ll be fine in a few hours&#39; feel, then I wouldn&#39;t quibble it. I assume FicPsych are used to agents getting dropped on them, and like to get them sorted out as soon as possible. (Equally, I&#39;d imagine they&#39;re pretty blase about agents snapping - it happens all the time, if they get all worked up about it they&#39;ll never get anything done! But I don&#39;t really know FicPsych myself, so.)<br><br>Referencing Constance as a patient, though, speaks of a definite issue (and I&#39;m not even querying your decision). I kind of want to know how that got in there - Dorano, could you shed some light?<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I rewrote a section to add a throwaway detail, and vaguely recalled Constance being connected to FicPsych at some point. I thought she&#39;d been a patient, but I didn&#39;t fact-check it. So that&#39;s just my own personal screw-up.<br><br>Also yes, I did immediately go back and begin reworking the Agents and the bad Prompt to fit Iximaz&#39;s suggestions, hence all the changes. The idea for Going Postal was supposed to be Meg overreacting to Michelle being injured (as opposed to completely snapping) and essentially being sent to FicPsych for an enforced &quot;time-out&quot;, if you will. I wasn&#39;t entirely sure how to portray that, so I just kind of winged it. But yeah, the break-out and the &#39;sure go ahead&#39; did need to be fixed. (I figured since Mitch wasn&#39;t violent, nor had he ever been, he&#39;d be allowed visitors...?)</p>

            <p>In an effort to be fair to those who have not seen the movie yet, I&#39;ll stay in the non-spoiler zone.<br><br>The most important thing that I noticed was that the opening, with the trailing summary and the &quot;Star Wars&quot; title seemed poorly timed and that really threw me off balance once the movie actually started.<br><br>Another note, the characterization for Luke was pretty in line with how he acts in Jedi Knight Jedi Academy, which is about as vague as I can be and still speak about how C-canon he was.<br><br>Finally, one event bothered me more than pretty much everything in the movie. The event was more for shock value than actually moving the plot forward.<br><br>All in all, I really enjoyed the Force Awakens. It was a fun and exciting tribute to the series as well as a visually gorgeous movie.</p>

Maz responds to the will of the Force, not any particular liking for Rey (and my pet theory is that Maz tries to fob that lightsaber off on someone every year or so, but they never take it.)

            <p>(I&#39;m not sure what you&#39;re talking about with the opening: that&#39;s, um, how every single <i>Star Wars</i> movie starts? What was different here?)<br><br>Um... basically my comment is &#39;squeeeeeeeeeee!&#39;. There aren&#39;t many movies I want to see twice in cinema - this is one of them.<br><br>One thing I really liked (on thinking about it) was the new protagonist trio. They managed to be at the same level as the protagonists of <i>A New Hope</i>, without being carbon copies of them. Without spoilers, I can say:<br><br>-<i>A New Hope</i> featured a naive farmboy who lost his family, a disreputable smuggler, and a princess who immediately got captured. All three are at a pretty low ebb in the early parts of the movie, and we get to see their struggle to actually impact the world around them.<br>-<i>The Force Awakens</i> trio (actually it&#39;s a bit more complicated than that, but still) also all hit that level of &#39;low&#39; early on. None of them start the main plot in positions of strength, which makes it interesting to follow them climbing back up. But while, arguably, one character is similar in summary to one of the original three, the other two fall into entirely new categories.<br>-In stark contrast, the four protagonists of <i>The Phantom Menace</i> are: a pair of galaxy-renowned Jedi, a ruling queen, and a superpowered slave boy. While Qui-Gon, Obi-Wan, and Amidala all get into <i>difficulties</i>, none of them lose their positions of <i>power</i>. The Jedi just needed to find a ship; Amidala just needed to reach Coruscant. Anakin is the only one who&#39;s ever &#39;weak&#39;, but he is immediately told he&#39;ll be rescued by <i>deus ex Jedi</i>.<br><br>Compare the prequel&#39;s &#39;bother, our ship is a bit broken, we&#39;d better stop to fix it&#39; with ANH&#39;s &#39;my family are dead and the planet I was supposed to go to is dead and now my mentor is dead too!&#39;; which one sounds like a more interesting character arc? If you said the second one, you&#39;re right - and that&#39;s the sort of thing you&#39;ll see in <i>The Force Awakens</i>.<br><br>(Though not those specific troubles. Obviously.)<br><br>I loved the various ways the film paid homage not just to the original movies - lots of lines and visuals in there - but also to the dear departed EU. Unnnnfortunately they&#39;re all spoilers. ;) But I spotted things that felt like references to everything from the <i>X-Wing</i> books (a certain character is clearly ex-Rogue Squadron) to... er, what was the last thing we had? That, anyway. ^_^<br><br>(There were also a lot of older actors who got inexplicable closeups; I really have to wonder if they were original/prequel actors. If you watch it, look for the woman who tends someone&#39;s injury; who <i>is</i> she?)<br><br>As Superfluity says, it was also <i>gorgeous</i>. You could absolutely tell that the outdoor sequences took place in actual, physical environments, and it did wonders. A few of the &#39;matte paintings&#39; (which I assume were digital) looked a bit off, but other than that: stunning.<br><br>So what <i>didn&#39;t</i> I like? Mostly three things:<br><br>1/ Sadly, the X-wing sequences were less good than they should&#39;ve been. Partly because they were the most obviously CG (even if they weren&#39;t CG!), and partly because... well, remember how in ANH you actually felt bad when Porkins and Biggs died? Yeah, I can&#39;t name any of the pilots in this one (other than one we&#39;d already met), and have no idea which of them survived the film. The way we flashed between them felt like I was <i>supposed</i> to care, but I... didn&#39;t. (Makes me wonder if there&#39;s a deleted scene where we meet the squadron.)<br>2/ There&#39;s one sequence which seems to indicate you can see planets in other star systems in real-time from the ground. That&#39;s... wrong. :-/ (The alternative is that there are seven worlds in close proximity in the same system, which would work, but doesn&#39;t seem to be what they were aiming for.)<br>3/ There&#39;s no easy way to say this, but... one character is totally Voldemort, in his bald-snake-face period. I don&#39;t know what he&#39;s doing there, but I&#39;m sure it isn&#39;t good.<br><br>Overall? I said in advance that I wanted this to be to ANH what <i>Jurassic World</i> was to JP.<br><br>It isn&#39;t.<br><br>It&#39;s better.<br><br>hS<br><br>PS: And I am ridiculously pleased that it&#39;s possible to summarise about half the plot in one incredibly spoilery word. ~hS</p>

            <p>The inaccurate portrayal of certain body parts.<br><br>The thing is, I saw one Chinese yaoi fanfic today on a forum, and the description of the smut scenes gave me a very.......interesting mental image.<br><br>&quot;exposing his petite pink flower&quot;<br><br>FLOWER? <br><br>Yep, it may bear some similarity, but soon, this weird description of the body part in question appeared.<br><br>&quot;slender fingers slowly explored the eye of his flowers, and the shy little petals shivered slightly under the cold touch.&quot;<br><br>PETALS?! PETALS?! PETALS?! For the love of YALDABAOTH, what the [DATA EXPUNGED]is that thing? <br><br>This is definitelt not right, and I keep getting mental images of some types of marine invertebrates when I tried to imagine that......thing described in the fic. The final bizarre description did nothing but reinforce it.<br><br>&quot;Sweet nectar started to ooze out of his hole.&quot;<br><br>NECTAR. This fic really has some unnatural fetishs over flowers. Maybe we should get a Flower to look at that. <br><br>By the way, if someone had seen similar fics that created such a grotesque mental image, feel free to share. Sometimes Bad Slash really get a little too creative with their metaphors and descriptions.   <br><br> </p>

            <p>Here we go, my first time doing this... Ahem...<br><br>Basically, there&#39;s a gap in the list of missions for Rashida and Sarah, supposedly for a mission that took place at about the same time as my co-write with eatpraylove (&quot;Pilot&quot;). I was going to fill that gap another co-write with someone else, but things didn&#39;t work out for us. However, I didn&#39;t want to leave the gap un-filled, so after like a year of procrastination, I decided to go combing the Pit just the other day to find old badfics from the fandoms I&#39;m familiar with.<br><br>And I came across THIS:<br><br><i><b>Midnight Star</b> (Percy Jackson and the Olympians X Twilight)<br>Bella never came to Forks. Instead, her cousin Susan Dawson moved in with her uncle . And after moving to Forks, she met the Cullens and found herself drawn to Edward. But the Cullens aren&#39;t the only ones with a secret . . . Edward/OC. Abandoned.<br>Rated: Fiction T - English - Romance/Drama - [Edward, OC] - Chapters: 14 - Words: 62,026 - Reviews: 106 - Favs: 107 - Follows: 125 - Updated: Feb 21, 2011 - Published: Aug 19, 2010 - id: 6252467</i><br><a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6252467/1/Midnight-Star"><a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6252467/1/Midnight-Star">https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6252467/1/Midnight-Star</a></a><br><br>Yes, it&#39;s exactly as bad as it sounds. Urple prose almost ripped from the first Twilight book, stupid Mary Sue OC, and shameless inserting the PJO characters into the Twilight canon. The only good thing is that the Sue&#39;s replaced the role of Bella, but that&#39;s not saying much.<br><br>So, since it&#39;s old, and Rashida knows PJO, I thought this would be perfect. I&#39;m a little rusty with Twilight, though (haven&#39;t read it in years), so I suppose I could use a hand with both keeping Sarah in check and canon knowledge.<br><br>With this in mind, I would prefer co-writing with someone whose agents fit the following three criteria:<br>- They were active during November of 2014, which is when the mission takes place,<br>- At least one of them knows the Twilight continuum, and<br>- They work in either the DF or the DIC.<br><br>If any of you are interested in giving a birb a hand, please shoot me an e-mail (I&#39;ve made my username clickable). Keep in mind that I&#39;ll be busy with relocating to Washington DC over the next few weeks, but I&#39;ll be sure to work something out with you.<br><br>Thanks for your help! :D<br><br>-SS</p>

            <p>Yes, my language was undiplomatic. But Skarm has said to me that he wants to improve, and he&#39;s not going to improve without a serious going-over by someone with a different approach to mission writing. Skarm has a lot of bad habits, and what he needs to cure most of them is a hatchet woman to edit him down.<br><br>That all said, it doesn&#39;t really matter what I think about his missions. I&#39;m hardly in line for a Booker Prize on the evidence of my few attempts at PPC writing. So, all I can do is apologise. I&#39;m sorry for being a dick to you, Skarm.

            <p>My depressive urges would. They&#39;re not me. It&#39;s tough not to listen to the little excrescences sometimes, because it never, ever stops, but that is no reason not to try.<br><br>Ix, I&#39;m sorry for that. I don&#39;t offer my issues as an excuse, but a reason. I don&#39;t think for a moment they make what I do acceptable. I also realise that this is still blaming my issues, and it does still have to stop. I&#39;m just... not good at that yet. I&#39;m sorry.</p>

            <p><b>Granted!</b><br><br>*throws cakefetti*<br><br>Your characters look solid, your grasp on PPC knowledge looks good, and I was entertained as I read the stories. I will note your SPaG was a bit shaky in places, but it&#39;s nothing a good going-over by a beta (or several) won&#39;t hopefully fix. You took the advice offered in your last few attempts and improved on it. While I don&#39;t know the continuum to make a call on the badfic, well. Badfic is badfic is badfic, and even without knowing the characters I think I can point out what&#39;s wrong with it. <br><br>So yes, third time&#39;s the charm indeed. Use your newfound power responsibly. :P</p>

            <p>Hi there beauties and gentlebeauties,<br><br>Normally I wouldn&#39;t inform the Board about me having a break, but this is special... and, to be honest, I&#39;m kinda scared. Today&#39;s medical check-up revealed that there is something iffy about my heart. It&#39;s probably nothing, but I&#39;m about to pack some stuff and check-in to the hospital. If everything goes smoothly, I&#39;ll be out next week. So yeah, you may not hear from me for a while because the hospital Internet suuuuuuucks (i.e. it&#39;s nonexistent).<br><br>Bye-bye for now, darlings~!</p>

        <div class="post-body">
            <p>First off, I want to apologize that so much of what I have to say is rather negative.  Overall, I think your writing was very good, and I especially enjoyed the first mission.  That said, my issues with some of the pieces are far more complicated than my enjoyment of the rest of them, and I&#39;m afraid that I feel somewhat obligated to dedicate rather more words to.<br><br>As a minor criticism, I notice that Des seems to have his own set of nicknames that he uses for people.  While that&#39;s an acceptable character trait, it gets a little confusing at times, as some of them aren&#39;t really intuitive to the reader.  I was especially confused by the fact that he calls the Reader Saa, but the Librarian and the Aviator call her Xan.<br><br>I have to admit that I share hS&#39;s concerns with regards to &quot;Excuses and Accusations.&quot;  Overall, it just has a strong sense of mood whiplash to it.  The Librarian&#39;s reaction is so over-the-top at first that it almost comes off as a form of black comedy, and then we go into a very personal exploration of his feelings.  I mean, I understand where he&#39;s coming from, and I think you did a good job with it, but it just feels kind of uneven.<br><br>I also found the specific insults that he throws at the Aviator to be kind of uncomfortably crossing a line.  I get that the Librarian&#39;s a jerk, but calling her a “whore” in particular is just so strongly and unnecessarily gendered and sexualized that it makes me flinch a bit.  Maybe if he was someone cruder I could forgive it, but it didn&#39;t exactly fit his character; the Librarian&#39;s never shown any sort of gender-based prejudices, and there are several other insults he could have chosen.  And I get that the Aviator isn&#39;t exactly in a state of mind to object specifically to that, and that it&#39;s a relatively minor issue in the grand scheme of things, but the fact that everyone just ignores it rubs me the wrong way.<br><br>Finally, I feel as if there are a few holes in the story.  First off, it doesn&#39;t really make sense for the Riddle of the Osirians to be something that both the Aviator and the Reader are able to recognize at a glance, but the Librarian has to pour over.  It seems to suggest that both of them possess significantly greater language skills than he does; but the Librarian has devoted years to studying this, whereas they only have a casual interest.  I could excuse it for the sake of humor in a lighter piece, but considering the serious nature of the interlude, it just feels incongruous.  Secondly – and more seriously – how the hell did the Librarian stay out of FicPsych?  Destruction of his life&#39;s work or not, he just attacked a fellow agent over an ultimately frivolous matter.  And from the PPC&#39;s perspective, the depression he sunk into afterwards is almost more dangerous.  He needs serious counseling, not just from his friends but from a trained therapist.  Frankly, the fact that he doesn&#39;t get that feels like a serious oversight, and, despite the PPC&#39;s many other flaws as a workplace, not one that it&#39;s likely to make at all.<br><br>I also had some issues with the end of “No More Mr Nice Guy.”  I mean, I get that what the Librarian said to the Aviator was unkind, and I&#39;m not trying to downplay the effects of PTSD or anything, but it doesn&#39;t seem to match up with her behavior earlier in the mission.  I got the sense that she was significantly more upset about the fact that he&#39;d nearly left her and Des to die than she was by his earlier remarks.  And she seems to have gotten over both of those instances by the end of the mission.  Perhaps if she&#39;d thrown some sort of dig in at him for it later or something, that would have fit better, but as-is, it feels a bit as though the Aviator is bringing up the wrong issue.  I&#39;m not saying she should be over it or anything, but rather, that it doesn&#39;t seem to really come through how much she&#39;s holding it in until the end, and that, in combination with the fact that she was also upset over something that was probably more relevant to Des as well, just makes things feel kind of uneven, as if the two parts of the story don&#39;t match up terribly well.<br><br>Also making me kind of uncomfortable is the implication that Des responded by beating up the Librarian.  Don&#39;t get me wrong, what the Librarian did was cruel and uncalled-for, but that doesn&#39;t exactly justify Des&#39;s behavior, either.  Frankly, it comes off as though Des is bordering on abusive.  This is especially in contrast to the way he responds to the Aviator nearly being killed by the Librarian.  If he assaults her over an innocent remark, then his feelings are prioritized over her safety, but him being rude is deserving of a beating?  Again, it feels unbalanced.  It comes off a little bit as though the one who&#39;s the most upset is the one who deserves the sympathy in any situation, and while that&#39;s an understandable perspective to have, it&#39;s not really a healthy one.  I&#39;m not saying characters should always have to behave in the most rational way, either – but the fact remains that the whole situation feels extremely dysfunctional, and nobody seems to notice.  Dysfunctional viewpoints aren&#39;t at all unusual in the PPC, but this is a rather more serious example than most, and the very fact that nobody takes issue with it all gives the readers the rather uncomfortable impression that they aren&#39;t supposed to see this as dysfunctional at all.<br><br>I&#39;m sorry for how long this was, as well as how negative it comes off.  You&#39;re all excellent writers and I did enjoy reading your missions.  I just wanted to make sure that I expressed my concerns as clearly as possible, especially given that some of them stretch into serious real world territory.</p>

            <p>I don’t think that this has anything to do with language skills. In the version of the Whoniverse were Gallifrey burned, the riddle and its solution may be a well known text book example for students learning Osirian, probably taken from an Osirian children’s book. (I didn’t check their convoluted timelines, so I don’t know whether the reference &quot;three hundred and… eh, thirty-two years ago&quot; fits the assumption that Arin read the book to little Saa.) When the Reader and the Aviator both recognized the riddle and remembered the answer, they may not have realized that this was the big thing the Librarian obsessed about, because they would never have guessed that this specific book was not so well known on every other version of Gallifrey. The Librarian, on the other hand, took the riddle he got from some obscure source far too serious and never considered that it might be a silly children’s pun.<br><br>HG</p>

            <p>Should everything be spelled out, or is it sufficient to mention that the Reader recognizes the Riddle, although her not recognizing the Riddle wouldn’t change the plot? It obviously depends on which kind of stories you like.<br><br>Since it is there, it must be significant in some way. Since it apparently isn’t plot relevant, it is either a red herring to distract us from the surprise solution that will be presented later, or it is a hint that the Aviator’s way of solving the Riddle is something she has in common with the Reader, but doesn’t share with the Librarian. <ol>
<li>They both are Time Ladies; the Librarian is a guy.<br>
</li>
<li>They may both possess excellent language skills that have never been hinted at.<br>
</li>
<li>They share experiences in a universe the Librarian doesn’t know.<br>
</li>
<li>The Riddle of the Osirians may be well known on World One’s Earth (obviously under another name), and Arin may have told little Saa about it.<br>
</li>
<li>...</li>
</ol>For some readers, it’s fun to jog our brains, trying to find the most plausible solution.<br><br>Since I came up with Nr. 4, I can’t decide between it and Nr. 3. Does somebody know a children’s book whit a pun-based riddle where the solution is a mouse?<br><br>HG</p>

            <p>The whole idea came from this bit where Ix asked me what&#39;s that riddle about. I told her that I had no idea and wasn&#39;t planning on saying anything concrete because I&#39;m not smart enough to create a riddle profound enough for Lump to obsess over; then she asked, &quot;what if the answer is something silly, like &#39;a mouse&#39;?&quot; and it kinda rolled from there.</p>

            <p>But the way you present it makes me think about epigraphy. Most of the texts studied that way could be compared to pubs and decrets from today, according to my teacher and the ones I saw, and I&#39;m not even talking about actual graffitis like these found in Pompei. It&#39;s just like the Librarian thought he was working on his Rosetta Stone, only to discover he was reading some sneaky insult adressed to the Ptolemy who was reigning at this time.

            <p>&#39;Prime Mover&#39;:<br><br>Unfortunate timing on the release here; it falls foul of a couple of points from <i>The Force Awakens</i> (no spoilers here). You claim hyperjumping into a mass shadow will blow up both you and the planet, which is no longer true; you also say you can&#39;t use the Force to put someone to sleep, which we also see. Your mission obviously took place before the movie, so it&#39;s fine not to know about those - but it also took place <i>after</i> the decanonisation of the EU, so making claims based on it is a dubious proposition.<br><br>As for an actual review: I enjoyed the character interactions, particularly between Des and the Reader. What caught me off-guard was the fact that the <i>entire mission</i> seemed to be dialogue. I&#39;m sure you <i>did</i> describe some of the action in narrative, but it didn&#39;t stick in my head. I was watching people reporting what was going on right in front of them, when it would&#39;ve felt more natural for the narrative to do the telling and the agents just comment when things got weird.<br><br>&#39;Truth and Consequences&#39;:<br><br>This story splits cleanly into two halves (&#39;Truth&#39; and &#39;Consequences&#39;, I suppose). I like the first - I like particularly the Reader&#39;s expression of her feelings. The whole “I’m sick of hating you&quot; idea really rings true.<br><br>The second half I&#39;m less sure on. I like the way the Aviator reacts to the Reader&#39;s revelations, but it feels like I&#39;ve spent a lot of time being told about how the Reader can&#39;t go back to her Gallifrey. It&#39;s like having characters repeatedly introduce themselves to each other - yes, <i>they</i> don&#39;t know, but the <i>audience</i> does.<br><br>&#39;Excuses and Accusations&#39;:<br><br>Ooookay. So the Librarian&#39;s having a complete meltdown and pulling a &#39;I will shut down so I never get hurt again!&#39; over someone else finding the solution to his hobby? Either this is seriously overwritten, or I&#39;m seriously misreading, or... he&#39;s just not a nice character. The fact that the Reader and the Aviator seem to see his reaction as <i>understandable</i> suggests one of the first two. His behaviour - his <i>attempt to murder the Aviator while yelling sexist insults at her</i> - is not something that should&#39;ve been brushed off and validated by his purported &#39;friends&#39;.<br><br>So no, I&#39;m afraid this one fell massively flat for me.<br><br>&#39;No More Mister Nice Guy&#39;:<br><br>Skipping this one, too irritated by the Librarian right now.<br><br>&#39;You&#39;ll Thank Me Later&#39;:<br><br>Ditto.<br><br>&#39;TYH: Tales of Regeneration&#39;:<br><br>I love the premise here: it&#39;s one we&#39;d never see on the show, but it is absolutely valid.<br><br>And then Naya shows up, and you&#39;ve just sent me down a rabbit-hole trying to figure out what&#39;s going on. So Naya was married to a woman but suddenly has a husband instead - and doesn&#39;t react to this at all? Surely that would be worth <i>some</i> confusion and uncertainty. Or is this an established part of the character?<br><br>I prefer this version of the Librarian - she doesn&#39;t immediately put me on edge, so that&#39;s nice. Though with that &#39;like the Notary used to&#39; line, and the Aviator, I&#39;m thinking Morgan is having <i>fits</i> in the Council: &quot;How come you all keep regenerating? Stick with one body for five minutes, for Omega&#39;s sake!&quot; And then someone points out that she regenerated twice in two years...<br><br>Anyway, this was what any Ten Years Hence story should be: cute and fluffy, with a side order of &#39;hey, things have changed in unexpected ways&#39;. Also, small children.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Can&#39;t say much about <i>Prime Mover</i> in terms of canonicity; I&#39;m only a casual <i>Star Wars</i> fan, though I should have caught the lack of action. &gt;.&gt;<br><br>&quot;Truth and Consequences&quot; is going to be the last we&#39;ll hear about the Reader&#39;s Gallifrey being destroyed, at least for a good long while. The Aviator needed to find out at some point, so we decided to beat the dead horse one last time before leaving it alone.<br><br>Des wants to respond to &quot;Excuses and Accusations&quot; himself, though I will admit your points are valid (though the use of &#39;hobby&#39; is a bit mild; the Librarian&#39;s been having to be dragged along after his partner for a while now because he&#39;s too busy focusing obsessively on the Riddle to pay attention to hazardous or potentially hazardous surroundings). I&#39;m going to take another look at the story again because right now I&#39;m thinking it was a failure to properly convey the intent on the writers&#39; part. (The Aviator later kind of ignoring the fact he tried to kill her was supposed to be indicative she&#39;s still got some major issues, but if that wasn&#39;t clear enough, t&#39;was entirely my fault.)<br><br>As for the TYH: you&#39;ll have to ask SeaTurtle about Naya, but I&#39;m glad you liked everything else. :)<br><br>&quot;Oi, Morgan, I kept my last body for over a century and a half, thanks very little!&quot;</p>

            <p>Not that I can talk, but that&#39;s *nothing*.<br><br>-R<br><br>((Re: Prime Mover being a lot of dialogue...heh. We did try to fix that; I guess it could have done with even more fixing, going by your reaction. But good Lord, that was one of the most boring badfics I&#39;ve ever read. We did try to shift it further towards quotes and so on, but... yeah.<br><br>Re: the Truth half of T&amp;C, I&#39;m glad that works well! It&#39;s actually not the original version of where she was at emotionally by that point--in an earlier version of the plot she hadn&#39;t even yet come to terms with what they both did, not really. I&#39;m very glad we changed that back in October or whenever it was; it feels more interesting to me, really, and should be fun to continue with if we ever get around to writing them doing something together as attempted friends...<br><br>But yeah. While I do have a Reader and Kozar piece in the works (which is an expansion of an idea I&#39;ve had for quite a while now) which involves her home canon, it isn&#39;t likely to be finished for a while. So... expect it three years from now! :)<br><br>And I&#39;ll wait for further responses and so on before responding to E&amp;A, assuming I&#39;ll still have something to add.<br><br>As for the TYH, of course--which premise? The one of someone regenerating into a different gender, or being married at the time? I&#39;d assume the latter for logic&#39;s sake, as we&#39;ve now seen the former, but I&#39;m still curious.<br><br>Anyway, I&#39;m glad you liked it :) It was very fun to do, and kind of makes me want to do another one.<br><br>~DF))</p>

(Though I would&#39;ve complained far more if it&#39;d been extensively <i>quoted</i>; I have a strong and obvious preference for the writers <i>paraphrasing and interpreting</i> badfics.)<br><br>TYH: The premise I meant was the very start: the ring getting stuck on. ^_~ The Doctor always seems to magically end up in clothes that simply fit... The idea of involuntary sex-swapping due to regeneration is <i>also</i> an interesting premise, but one that didn&#39;t register until after I&#39;d written that line. :) (And it goes on the list of &#39;weird sexuoromance things that can only happen in HQ&#39;...)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>It didn&#39;t seem all that boring at first. Back then, we were caught up in going through and spotting just how many canon mistakes there were; and the mission itself was quite interesting to write, especially with getting to send Kozar in to mission something set in his home canon and think about how he&#39;d react to certain things there. That and all of the other character interactions were really fun to do.<br><br>By the time we were maybe a chapter, chapter and a half away from where we ended it, though, the badfic was getting wearing. Its MO doesn&#39;t really change: it&#39;s pretty much &#39;this chapter is another bare-bones recap/summary of 1-2 Star Trek episodes, possibly mashed together and likely changed in ways that make little sense apart from if the author just didn&#39;t bother to check what happened, together with Anakin and Padme and extra OOCness!&#39; The mission itself kept being fun, and there were still interesting things to take from the badfic for the characters and for the mission, but...I&#39;m happy enough to see the back of that badfic by now, especially once we had to go back several times to rewrite pieces of the mission.<br><br>Basically: we liked its potential, and it didn&#39;t bore me until we were far enough in that it made more sense to keep going (especially since I liked what we were getting for the mission itself) than to find an alternative fanfic to spork. So: no regrets, but I guess now I have a better idea of what will eventually bore me in a badfic! We live and learn. I&#39;ve learned that missioning with Des and with this combination of characters is fun, but that this is not my favorite sort of badfic to spork if we do something like four or five chapters of it.<br><br>Re: TYH: Ha :D Yeah, I guess we wouldn&#39;t see that on the show--even when Ten became Eleven, actually, although I suppose Eleven&#39;s fairly skinny as well...still, with how frequently Donna pointed out that Ten was &#39;a skinny streak of nothing&#39; (etc), it could&#39;ve been funny to watch Eleven going &quot;I can&#39;t breathe! Oh.&quot; and then loosening his jacket.<br><br>(Mainly, though, we should see this in shoes! No way are they all the same shoe size, it&#39;s ridiculous.)<br><br>The Reader and sex-swapping is interesting to me, partially because, way back when, I wrote myself a note saying I was pretty sure she&#39;d never been male. I found it some time after figuring out she&#39;d been born that way! It gets interesting to think about, especially when it spawns character-specific headcanons.<br><br>But yeah. Essentially, the premise of 4R&#39;s clothes and jewelry definitely not fitting a Chris Pine!5R properly seemed a, shall we say, logical one; and it was *very* fun to roll with :D<br><br>Me, I&#39;m still waiting for a Time Lord on or off the show to regenerate looking at least externally like a different type of alien--oh, wait, I&#39;ve seen that once. No clue if it&#39;ll ever become PPC canon, though--it belongs to the same storyline TYH!5R came from, and the author&#39;s been a bit inactive here recently.<br><br>~DF</p>

            <p>I&#39;m sure these are all part of your collective grand plans. I got a little confused at that one interlude, though, cause Rashida&#39;s wiki page lists a pending cowrite with Desdendelle also called &quot;Excuses and Accusations&quot;.<br><br>I&#39;m not even going to <i>try</i> to bring forth my usual list of minor errors and confusing statements. Y&#39;all released too many documents at once for that to be feasible. I am going to read all of them, however. :D</p>

            <p>...things just didn&#39;t work out between us two regarding that particular co-write, for a variety of reasons. The mission I&#39;m due to work on with Scape is the one that will fill that particular gap once it&#39;s published.<br><br>Which reminds me, I need to update a LOT of my agent pages as soon as I settle down in DC. Which should hopefully be by sometime next month, if the Ironic Overpower doesn&#39;t come knocking that is. :)</p>

            <p>Let&#39;s begin:<br><br>-Hurray for more missions with the Reader, and more backstory for Librarian. Will Tablet need a page someday?<br><br>-Just... <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlp_CXvHH48">this</a>, there&#39;s nothing else to say. Really sorry for their Gallifrey.<br><br>-I&#39;m torn between laughing at the sheer ridiculiousness of the situation, and intense pity for Librarian. Did expect him to be burned out because of this riddle, but not like this. Lot of self-loathing too (minor typo, Noakh becomes Moakh when you elaborate his name).<br><br>-He could have been a merciless jerk, but judging how well they were going along before, that&#39;s still a tremendous progress. Like how both of them go for snacks just before the badfic quote of first date (their first date is the destruction of this PPC badfic though.). And don&#39;t say I&#39;m imaginating things, even Tablet sees it (and really needs its own page). Is it really stretching up things that thinking there could be ...someone behind this sentience?<br><br>-Sheldon Cooper. Librarian is a Time Lord version of Sheldon Cooper. And now the pairing with Aviator is just mpossible to ignore. Great to see him finally undegoing positive character development.<br><br>-First time I see regeneration played for comedy, somewhat, and I fond it really interesting. So this little girl in Voyd&#39;s TYH was Ave and Librarian&#39;s... Kind of happy of seeing that they seem well, and Reader too, despite the regeneration. Second Librarian sounds interesting, and looks great. I hope to see more of her, but not before a long time, since reformed first Librarian is interesting too. Also hope this TYH will become canon.<br><br>All in all, it&#39;s a great early Christmas gift, guys. You&#39;re always so great at writing.</p>

            <p>Both the Librarian&#39;s friends&#39; names start with Moakh-,but one of them went by Noakh. Otherwise you&#39;d have Moakh and Moakh. Kind of like if two guys named James are friends, and one goes by James while another goes by Jim. <br><br>Oh man, the Riddle. The way the answer to that came about went something like this:<br><br>&quot;So, know what the answer to the Riddle is going to be?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Dunno, haven&#39;t thought of something appropriately epic, and there&#39;s always going to be someone underwhelmed by the revelation.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Why not go the other way and have it be something completely stupid like a mouse?&quot;<br><br>And thus an idea was born.<br><br>They went for food because they were hungry, not because they were going on a date. Did you miss the fact that the Librarian tried to, you know, kill her in a fit of madness? Or that they still kind of hate each other? The Tablet&#39;s just been programmed with a smart mouth; it&#39;s like how Zeb enjoyed trolling Rina out of her mind by saying she was secretly in love. And need I mention the dead kind-of sort-of boyfriend? <i>If</i> anything were to happen between the Aviator and the Librarian, it sure as heck won&#39;t be happening for a very long time. <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><s>like in ten years or so</s><br><br>(Though I did write a joke one-off involving an older Elanor and her parents (because seriously, the L/A pairing is so absurd you can&#39;t not use it), so that might be coming out sometime in the future.)</p>
