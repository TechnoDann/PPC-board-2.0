            <p>Hoo boy, can I just take a moment to point out how <i>amazing</i> the present is?<br><br>We have robots that clean up our living rooms, computer programs that can simulate worlds hundreds of miles wide and an intercontinental web that allows people in California to regularly interact and share ideas with people all the way in the UK. We might not be zooming through chrome cities in our hovercars, but the world right now is kind of amazing. I very much look forward to the coming years.<br><br>But as for this year I resolve, for starters, to start writing again (and perhaps to actually put in a Permission Request for the first time in... what, two years?). Also, more personally, I resolve to get my own place, and travel to somewhere I&#39;ve never been to, perhaps not in that order.</p>

            <p>It&#39;s funny how the present and our past futures have diverged so much. There&#39;s almost nothing in retrofuturity which envisioned our style of computer games and programs - Google Earth? Minecraft? Kerbal? Forget it. But on the other hand, there&#39;s very little which assumed we&#39;d still be using mice and MSWord, either.<br><br>The internet? It&#39;s a major part of many people&#39;s lives, but retrofuturity barely takes it beyond &#39;chat&#39;. Think of all the things you do on the &#39;net that <i>aren&#39;t</i> straight communication...<br><br>And... yeah, non-humanoid robots. Fiction and prediction alike have assumed that robots need to be fully aware (or at least capable of simulating it), or they&#39;re useless. But we have Roombas (my parents call theirs Dobby), and Siri, and self-driving cars, and...<br><br>... well, and all the things we don&#39;t even notice, the little automatic algorithms that tag your Facebook pictures, or fill in your username for you, or filter out your spam emails. It&#39;s all <i>very very clever</i>. But we&#39;re still waiting for those hoverboards.<br><br>But... I guess it&#39;s the same for everything. Why are dinosaurs and mammoths unspeakably cool, when their direct descendents, swans and elephants, are &#39;coolish&#39; at best? Why is it that the future you don&#39;t have is more exciting than the one you&#39;re living in - when the one you&#39;ve got is way more advanced?<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Happy New Year, everyone, and have a pleasant surprise to kick off 2015! I already broached this idea to two of my betas, but basically, I&#39;ve decided to set up a new PPC holiday event. The New Year&#39;s Gift Exchange is inspired by a similar event I attended at a real-life holiday party a few days ago, and I thought I&#39;d give it a try with a number of PPC agents!<br><br>So, without further ado, here are the rules:<br><br>ADMISSION AND SETUP:<br>1. You need to have Permission and at least two agents to enter this event.<br>2. In a reply to this post, list each of your attending agent teams and one gift for each team member to bring. This may be either a &quot;souvenir&quot; from a mission you&#39;ve published previously, or just something they happen to have that they want to give away.<br>3. I will take four or five other Boarders for this year&#39;s event, so the first five Boarders to submit applications will be the ones attending it.<br>4. For future events like this, anyone with Permission can host this event. One of their agents must serve as an in-universe host for this event; any other agents in the host&#39;s team are to participate as players.<br><br>EVENT RULES:<br>5. I will set up an introductory post on the Message Board for this event, with a full guest list for all attending. The most important rule: <b>NOBODY MUST KNOW WHAT THE GIFTS ARE UNTIL THEY&#39;VE OPENED THEM.</b> Surprise is the driving factor here! This means that all of the gifts are wrapped and put in a big pile at the start of the game.<br>6. Once I&#39;ve tallied the full list, each player will get a random number, with the range depending on how many players there are. The agents must play in that order via replies to the starting post.<br>7. The agent currently in play can either choose a gift from the pile (I&#39;ll provide the full list of gifts on the Posting Board) or, if others before them have already chosen gifts, they can &quot;steal&quot; a gift from the previous owner. A gift can be stolen up to twice; after that, it is locked to the agent it&#39;s ended up with, and cannot be stolen again.<br>8. The game ends once everyone has received a gift. Since the first agent cannot steal, he/she will be given the choice to steal after this. The host cannot steal.<br><br>All right, that should be it. Have fun, everyone, and I can&#39;t wait to get this thing started! :D</p>

            <p>Anyway, lookin&#39; good so far, everyone! Might as well throw in my lot since I started this thing! :D<br><br>From RC #227:<br>Rashida: She&#39;ll will be hosting the event, so she won&#39;t bring anything. Not that she&#39;d want to, anyway...<br>Falchion: The coprolite mini-Boulder, shit ruond. He had it wrapped in an airtight package because the smell would be overpowering otherwise!<br>Sarah: A glitter-stained crowbar. It originally belonged to her mother, but she gave it up once her homefic was killed.<br><br>From RC #133,316,666:<br>Rayner: The severed horn of Not!Sombra, the MLP Character Replacement from his first mission with his new partner.<br>E.V.L.: From the same mission, a necklace ganked from the fic&#39;s Sue, with an alicorn-shaped pendant.<br><br>@Iximaz: If you&#39;d be happy to help, I&#39;ll gladly take two more slots! Eight Boarders means at least 16 agents... Man, this will be a doozy! (Though to be fair, the gift-exchange event at the party I attended had at least 28 people involved...)</p>

            <p>Hey there, PPC. A few days ago I googled &quot;casandra claire plagiarism&quot; and stumbled upon the &quot;cassandra claire&quot; article of your wiki. I ended up reading a lot of your wiki, the original series, and the Constitution. I found your mission admirable (I, too, long for the elimination of badfic). Then I decided I&#39;d like to join you. So hi!<br>A little about myself: I prefer she/her pronouns. I do not exactly &quot;belong&quot; to any fandoms, but I do sort of hang around the outskirts of a few, such as the Thomas Harris Universe (NBC&#39;s Hannibal, Silence of the Lambs, etc.), Harry Potter, Doctor Who, and some Broadway plays/musicals. I also like retro gaming, animation, gothic artwork, true crime, drag queens/kings, and independent professional wrestling. I am in university, studying biology, so bad biology in fics drives me especially nuts. <br>I love to write fiction, but I can&#39;t say I&#39;ve really written fan fiction, except for one or two stories back in middle school *shudder*. It occurred to me that I and a few of my friends have been doing our own sort of &quot;sporking&quot; fan fiction for years now. We enjoy reading/critiquing badfics, and on occasion have even drawn comics of badfics to illustrate how absurd they were. We never posted our stuff on the internet, but when I was reading PPC missions it kind of reminded me of our fanfic critique.<br>Sorry if I&#39;m too long-winded! I based this post off of the joining section of the FAQ.</p>

            <p>No need to apologize for the post, especially since it&#39;s based on the FAQ. It&#39;s always nice to see newbies show up, so have a juice box and a chainsaw. Because what could go wrong with indiscriminately handing out chainsaws?</p>

            <p>Re: Thantosiet: Thanks for the bag; otherwise I might not have been able to carry all these lovely gifts! To answer your question, a couple come to mind...most recently we&#39;ve tackled some particularly heinous &quot;Ed, Edd, and Eddy&quot; slash fics, featuring extreme OOC, bad biology, plus the author inserted a Mary Sue as the Eds friend who also happens to be a huge yaoi fangirl...ugh! But one that particularly jumps up for me is a Ted BundyxJeffrey Dahmer fan fiction...you know, the REAL LIFE SERIAL KILLERS. Virtually any sane person can see why writing that fic is in ridiculously poor taste.</p>

Sometimes the professor starts writing his own homework problems and that&#39;s when you start worrying: if he wrote the problem, then he finds it <i>interesting</i>, which means that it&#39;s <i>difficult</i>, which means that we have to get really <i>creative</i> in our setup if we need to find a solution to the problem.<br><br>Afterwards, we go and laugh at engineers because we think that we&#39;re better than them but in reality we have no idea what we&#39;re doing.</p>

            <p><i>A/N: Happy [belated] New Year, everyone! I thought I&#39;d start a thing, so here it is!<br><br>The post with the rules and all of the listed gifts can be found <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=266767;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">here</a>, and the spreadsheet I will be using to keep tally, including the order of play, can be found <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Wjrt3s70P6755DhKE5qIsSwH46x5SSiFUPU66Rz6n-8/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>.</i><br><br>**********<br><br>&quot;Do I really have to be the host for this game?&quot; Rashida growled, having swept the last bit of dirt away from the now spotless RC. &quot;I don&#39;t even celebrate New Year&#39;s...&quot;<br>&quot;Oh come on, Rose! It&#39;ll be fun!&quot; Sarah hedged. &quot;We even invited that DMS team you told us about once! You know, the one with... Rayner, right?&quot;<br>&quot;You did <i>what?!</i>&quot;<br>&quot;I actually met Rayner just after my second mission,&quot; Falchion reminded them. &quot;He&#39;s actually a pretty nice guy, though a bit of a hard-ass at times. You don&#39;t have to get so upset about this.&quot;<br>&quot;I completely understand his reasons to doubt me, Falchion,&quot; Rashida replied. &quot;But has he learned anything at all?! He sent a Ra-forsaken Author Wraith to the Sunflower&#39;s office almost as soon as he was out from Medical, for Mafdet&#39;s sake!&quot;<br>&quot;Funny you should mention that - she&#39;s coming too,&quot; said Sarah. &quot;I really wanted to meet her after what Falchion told me, so...&quot;<br>Rashida gave her such a murderous glare that she instantly shut up.<br>&quot;B-but... E.V.L. got her glitter extracted! She shouldn&#39;t be too much of a problem,&quot; Falchion insisted. &quot;Besides, we were the ones picked to host the Gift Exchange this year, and you can&#39;t just turn someone down in front of everyone! It&#39;ll look unfair!&quot;<br>&quot;I know,&quot; the Sphinx agent growled, straightening her whiskers. &quot;But if she tries anything stupid, there will be trouble. Anyway, let&#39;s just get this event over with. There should be... eighteen guests. This will take a while.&quot;<br>&quot;Eighteen guests?!&quot; Sarah almost shouted.<br>&quot;To be fair,&quot; her adopted brother pointed out, &quot;this <i>is</i> a fairly big RC...&quot;<br><br>**********<br><br>&quot;Welcome to all of you!&quot; Rashida announced once all the guests had filed in, exchanged greetings, and took their seats around the huge pile of wrapped presents on the coffee table. &quot;It is my displeasure to host the annual PPC New Year&#39;s Gift Exchange. I take it all of you brought gifts?&quot;<br>Falchion sprang up suddenly. &quot;Guh! J-just a sec, Rosie... I totally forgot!...&quot;<br>Rashida facepawed while her avian partner grabbed some random tinfoil and rushed off to the closet. A moment later, he&#39;d come back with what looked like a large ball of foil, which he quickly added to the pile.<br>&quot;I can&#39;t believe I&#39;m doing this,&quot; the Sphinx fumed silently before continuing. &quot;Anyway, the rules for this Gift Exchange are as follows: You will have all received a random number upon your arrival. That number indicates the order in which you will play. An agent in play can either pick a gift from the pile, or steal one from another agent who&#39;s chosen previously. A gift can be stolen up to twice before it is locked to a particular user. You must not know your gifts prior to opening them, you cannot choose your own gift, blah blah blah...&quot;<br>She raised her feathery tail like a starting flag. &quot;Anyway, worst of luck to all of you. Now, let the games... BEGIN!&quot;</p>

            <p>&quot;Was that the last one?&quot; asked Falchion.<br>Rashida checked the list. &quot;Yes, actually, I believe it was the last one. So yes, thank you for attending. Now, run along back to your RCs. I&#39;m tired...&quot;<br>&quot;Wait, wait! Guys, the countdown&#39;s about to end!&quot; Sarah cried excitedly.<br>&quot;We&#39;ve got thirty seconds to go,&quot; said E.V.L. &quot;Just give all of us this one chance?&quot;<br>Falchion gave his partner a pleading look. &quot;Rashida... This is our first time hosting this event. And we&#39;re so close to the finale. At least let us celebrate the stroke of midnight.&quot;<br>Rashida facepawed. &quot;Okay, fine. Just leave me out of it...&quot;<br>&quot;Actually, I wanted to give you something too. Wait, wait! Ten seconds to go!&quot;<br>The party goers looked at Rashida&#39;s digital sundial, unanimously counting the seconds until the clock showed midnight.<br>&quot;Nine!&quot;<br>&quot;Eight!&quot;<br>&quot;Seven!&quot;<br>&quot;Six!&quot;<br>&quot;Five!&quot;<br>&quot;Four!&quot;<br>&quot;Three!&quot;<br>&quot;Two!&quot;<br>&quot;One!&quot;<br>&quot;<b>HAPPY NEW YEAR!!!</b>&quot;<br>Everyone who was in the mood to cheer did so, throwing confetti, cakefetti, and other assorted miscellanies all over the place. Falchion thankfully resisted the urge to throw Spikes as well.<br>&quot;So... About that gift?&quot; asked Rashida.<br>Falchion nodded, pulling open a nearby drawer with his beak, and took out several small, black balls, which he offered to her. &quot;I wanted to give you these.&quot;<br>She took them in surprise, turning them over in her hands. &quot;What are they?&quot;<br>&quot;Dark Balls. A type of Pokй Ball from my home continuum - the fourth movie of the anime specifically. I got them from the training mission with Chris and Ami. I told you about a while ago.&quot; He nodded to them before continuing. &quot;They were originally used to capture some legendary Pokйmon, but I was thinking that they could be modified to quarantine any CAFs we may eventually rescue, so I figured, well...&quot;<br>She looked at him, her red-pink eyes wide. &quot;You wanted to... give these to me?&quot;<br>He looked at her with a disappointed expression. &quot;If you don’t want them, well...&quot;<br>To his complete surprise, she hugged him. In front of everyone.<br>&quot;I never received a gift from anyone at the PPC. I don&#39;t know what to say...&quot;<br>&quot;You&#39;re welcome,&quot; replied Falchion. &quot;And Happy New Year to you too.&quot;<br>&quot;Yo, birdie!&quot; Rayner called out to them. &quot;When we&#39;re done, can E.V.L. and I stick around for a bit? You may need some extra help to clean up all this confetti!&quot;<br>If Falchion could have blushed, he would have. &quot;Oh, right... I forgot you didn&#39;t like having confetti all over our RC...&quot;<br>Rashida facepawed again. &quot;This is going to be a <i>long</i> 2015.&quot;<br><br><b>[END]</b><br><br>**********<br><br><i>A/N: That took a *lot* longer than I thought it would, but it looks like this RP is officially complete.

            <p>She was far too nice to steal someone else&#39;s gift (and most of them looked kind of weird anyway), so she levitated the final package over to her.

            <p>&quot;Oh, please,&quot; he muttered under his breath. &quot;The entire point of the so-called &quot;Schrцdinger&#39;s cat&quot; paradox is to <i>prove</i> that the entire concept of a system being in two conflicting states at once is ridiculous.

The wave function is only a probability function. Unlike classical mechanics, which allows you to make highly accurate predictions about a system, quantum mechanics only describes the <i>probability</i> of events happening.

            <p>Fiorano stood up and walked over to the pile, where only two presents were left. She closed her eyes and grabbed randomly. She picked up a thin package, and, after tearing it open, held out a bar of Bleepolate. &quot;Uh. OK then.&quot;</p>

Oh, right!&quot;<br>The Skarmory stood up, strutting towards the pile, and wondering if he should pick anything.

            <p>Falchion shrugged and gave the watch back to the other agents. &quot;If you really want it THAT badly, well...&quot;<br>&quot;That item is now locked and cannot be stolen again,&quot; said Rashida. &quot;That&#39;s the second time this has happened, but no matter.

            <p>Regardless, Rashida gave the pelt a wide berth. &quot;Keep it, Falchion.

            <p>&quot;<i>Keelah</i>, what is that thing?&quot; grumbled Naya as she fumbled with the underside of her helmet. &quot;Hang on a second, I just have to...&quot; The quarian pushed a button and twisted a valve under her helmet&#39;s chin piece. &quot;There we go. Much better.&quot;<br><br>The Guardsman, who had pulled a respirator over his face, chuckled at his partner. &quot;Closed off the air intake valve, eh?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yeah. I&#39;ll enough air for another hour; I don&#39;t feel like scrubbing my suit&#39;s olfactory filters today.&quot;<br><br><font><font size="2">&quot;Naya, I believe it is your turn.&quot;</font></font> said Terabyte, raising a finger.<br><br>&quot;Oh, is it? Well, then let&#39;s see...&quot;<br><br>The quarian woman stood up and examined the remaining gifts. There were several small boxes, one oddly-shaped lump, and a long box. She settled on the latter and returned to her seat. She united the strings that held down the box&#39;s lid and carefully opened the lid lest another malodorous mini pop out of it. A glint of polished wood caught her eye. She lifted the lid a little further. In the box sat a rifle made of a handsome light blue wood featuring a gold-and-silver hammer, trigger, and sights. Naya carefully lifted the weapon out of the box with both hands. <br><br>&quot;My word... now <i>that</i> is what you call a gift,&quot; whispered the quarian. She span around in her seat, making sure there was nobody in front of her, and squinted down the rifle&#39;s sights while keeping the weapon pointed at the ground. &quot;Iron sights... not bad. Not too heavy, either...&quot; She returned the rifle to her lap and ran a finger along the decoration on the rifle&#39;s stock. After a moment, Naya rose her head and addressed the room. &quot;Just a question, though: does the previous owner of this weapon know what this thing fires? It&#39;s not muzzle-loading, is it?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Who cares?&quot; said the Guardsman. &quot;Look at the thing. It&#39;s <i>beautiful!</i>&quot;</p>

            <p>Cepha smiled brightly as Naya got the rifle. &quot;That rifle is from Madoka Magica Online! It&#39;s a cute little browser game, you get a magical girl and can get weapons and clothes and stuff. That&#39;s one of the upper-class weapons - on the S tier, I believe. It&#39;s called the Hailstorm, or the Grandine - well, they mean the same thing.&quot;<br><br>She frowned in thought. &quot;I have no idea about the ammo thing. I think it just fires when you pull the trigger - in the game, you just have to have it equipped to a character and it works. The flavor text says it fires magic bullets, by the way. And not Madoka-style magic, where it chews up part of your soul for power every time.&quot;</p>

I broke it off him myself!&quot;<br>His partner nudged him irritably, upon which he added, &quot;Well, my partner helped...&quot;<br>The mini-Boulder, however, elicited a completely different response.

Not after they chose us to host this thing!&quot;<br>&quot;I said I was sorry!&quot; Falchion pleaded. &quot;I&#39;ll try to make it up to you, I promise!&quot;<br>Rashida looked around at the others, who were no doubt having such a good time. The Sphinx agent sighed bitterly.<br>&quot;All right, fine. Let&#39;s finish this.

One packet-- a long, rectangular box-- stood out of the pile, but another-- a simple envelope-- caught the ex-soldier&#39;s attention. The picked it up and returned to his place. Once settled, he slid a finger down the side of the envelope and pulled out a photograph.<br><br>&quot;Oh, lovely.&quot; The Gallifreyan man showed the photo to his partners. &quot;See this? The Polaroid, capital &#39;P&#39;. It&#39;s an item that, when its carrier is near death, generates an impenetrable shield for seven seconds. This is <i>definitely</i> going to be useful in a pinch.&quot;<br><br><font><font size="2">&quot;From what continuum does the Polaroid originate?&quot;</font></font> asked Terabyte.<br><br>&quot;Eh, <i>The Binding of Isaac</i>, if I remember correctly,&quot; replied the Guardsman. &quot;I just got the game recently. Awesome stuff, if a little difficult.&quot;<br><br>Naya leaned in close, looking at the photo. &quot;I didn&#39;t know that there were Pokйmon in that video game. Is it a crossover?&quot;<br><br>&quot;No, wha...&quot; said the Guardsman, turning the photo over and taking a good look at it. &quot;Oh. Never mind,&quot; he said, carefully putting the photo in his coat&#39;s pocket. <br><br></p>

He was sitting in a corner, as far away from everybody else as possible, having decided that leaning on the walls wasn&#39;t a good idea after having some Sar-plasm stick to his coat.<br>“Socialisation,” Des reminded him as he browsed the pile of gifts. The Librarian huffed, and Des gave him a doubting look before returning to the pile. He sat down, closed his eyes, and put his hand on a random gift. He picked it up – it was long and not quite light. Tearing the wrapping off, he revealed a vaguely ellipsoid rifle.<br>“Well, well, like I didn&#39;t have enough of those.”</p>

            <p>From her seat across the table, Naya laughed. &quot;Hey, missy! That right there is probably one of the best rifles in the galaxy,&quot; said the quarian, pointing at the Lancer in Des&#39; lap. &quot;It&#39;s an automatic, air-cooled turbocharged mass accelerator that makes World One assault rifles look like paintball guns.

            <p>Not sure if I got the acronym right, but&quot;Rise of the Brave Tangled Twisted Dragons&quot;would not fit in the title line. Anyway,I noticed there is a ROTBTD wiki located at <a href="http://rise-of-the-brave-tangled-dragons.wikia.com/"><a href="http://rise-of-the-brave-tangled-dragons.wikia.com/">http://rise-of-the-brave-tangled-dragons.wikia.com/</a></a> and it is currently unmaintained. Recently there has been quite a bit of flaming and everyone posting profanity etc. Should I attempt to maintain this wiki? I an not sure if fanfiction in this continuum is badfic or not but fanfics are not currently posted here, only information. Suggestions anyone? I will need someone to help out with the tangled part of the wiki as I have never seen that movie.</p>

            <p>Just looking at their Recent Activity... how does a page like <a href="http://rise-of-the-brave-tangled-dragons.wikia.com/wiki/Jackunzel">Jackunzel</a> (the Jack Frost/Rapunzel pairing, it turns out) end up with 500 comments, and 42 attached pictures, and 20 linked fanfics? The wiki itself only has 500 pages - how on earth is there <i>that much activity</i> on just one random page?<br><br>No, seriously. Honest question.

            <p>As hS has already pointed out, it&#39;s hard to know where to draw the line. On the other hand, maybe the wiki could benefit from having someone neutral who isn&#39;t invested in a lot of ships, so I&#39;m not opposed to you trying to clean up. Then again, I could imagine it is a thankless job, so you could maybe consider digging up a neglected wiki for a small fandom that you love and instead contributing there with content? <br><br>Anyway, if this is something your heart is really set on, we&#39;re not here to stop you. As long as you don&#39;t claim to be cleaning up the wiki on behalf of PPC, it&#39;s simply something you&#39;re doing in your free time.<br><br>One piece of advice, however: Start slowly and get to to know some of the other users. No-one likes it when somebody comes out of nowhere and starts editing with a hatchet, no matter how well-intentioned and how much it might be needed.</p>

            <p>Profanity I guess, though you could argue that on a shipping wiki, there&#39;s certain words that might be accepted by the readers as descriptive. Vandalism? Maybe the obvious stuff, but where do you draw the line? Serious edits could look like vandalism if you don&#39;t know what they&#39;re about.<br><br>And &#39;sock puppets&#39; -- eesh, I&#39;d just leave that one well alone.

And now I wonder if it&#39;s kind of stupid because there may be some kind of critical safeguard against it either in the organization or in the PPC canon that I am overlooking.<br><br>Have any Agents ever attempted to exploit a Sue/Stufic for their own (usually questionable) motives? Like, have any power-hungry, envious, and/or insecure Agents ever attempted to go rogue and usurp a Sue/Stu to gain their powers and/or position in life? Or maybe Agents who use questionable means to amass Sue byproducts en masse for whatever reasons?<br><br>I have heard of ruthless Agents like Agent X, but she seems more like an anti-Sue extremist than someone with an agenda.</p>

            <p>I mean, we write all these violent psychopaths, but they all spend their time focussed on their jobs. We know that there&#39;s a Department of Internal Affairs, and we know they&#39;ve been expanding recently - but we don&#39;t have much information as to <i>why</i>. There must be agents being locked up to necessitate the existence of a jail, right?<br><br>So what could you do, with access to all the multiverse&#39;s Stuff(TM)? Political power in your home universe? If you could get a Sue to serve you and use their reality-warping powers on important people, you could pull it off (think of whichever <i>Thursday Next</i> book it was that happened in). Selling addictive drugs? I&#39;m sure <i>something</i> in a Sue&#39;s body must qualify.<br><br>And if you go outside the realm of strictly Sue exploitation, you&#39;ve got <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bFaqnyKq4BQJ8z4_Zy9eVg5lbEptyC9RCnb9TrxTELk/pub">Morgan&#39;s little breakdown</a>, or even something as simple as <a href="http://plotprotectors.tripod.com/TOS/mission04.html">mass-producing invisible yarn</a>.

            <p>Due to my Agents&#39; personalities, they could reach the point where they would choose the safety/happiness of canon characters over ensuring that canon happenings... well, happen. Think about Huinesoron&#39;s Ispace, only that we have only three Agents focusing on a single continuum (Puella Magi Madoka Magica.

            <p>At one point the entire PPC was doing that, under the leadership of the Mysterious Somebody. Materials harvested from Suefics were being sold to canon worlds to create revenue for the PPC. Given what else was going on and linked to it (see: The Reorganisation), it shouldn&#39;t come as a surprise that all such things were eventually clamped down on with extreme prejudice. Anyone caught doing such things now would likely be severely punished.</p>

            <p>The continuum is quarantined because the author has asked that no-one write fanfic about it, and we in the PPC respect that. Writing about a creature from that continuum - even a miniature version - would be writing fanfic of it. So no.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>In the absence of an OFU, whoever first writes a mission to the &#39;verse and encounters minis gets to decide what the minis are. (It&#39;s polite to have a discussion about it first, though.)<br><br>I&#39;d be inclined to use mini-White Walkers, personally, since they pretty much threaten everyone equally. Or, since humanoid minis creep some people out (though I dunno if that necessarily applies to clearly monstrous humanoids), maybe mini-winters. They&#39;d be like little mobile blizzards. Maybe with glowing blue eyes set in the clouds. That might be too cartoony, but I kinda like the idea of OFU students retreating through the halls shouting &quot;Mini-winter is coming! <i>Mini-winter is coming!</i>&quot;<br><br>Alas, GRRM is unlikely to change his mind about fanfic anytime soon, so this must remain a hypothetical discussion.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>It sounds like you&#39;re having some kind of connection issue.<br><br>While we&#39;re on the subject of the wiki, though, could I ask you to please stop editing for matters of simple word choice? One of the first things I learned in my editing internship was never edit unless you can back it up with the rules; you let the author use their own voice as much as possible. For instance, on the Mary Sue page, you recently changed &quot;does not&quot; to &quot;doesn&#39;t&quot; and &quot;there&#39;s the rub&quot; to &quot;there we have the main problem&quot;. The first change doesn&#39;t do a thing to aid clarity and actually de-emphasizes a statement I was trying to emphasize, and the second merely replaces an informal turn of phrase with a formal one. Not only are those kinds of changes unnecessary—the first in particular, and the second because PPC Wiki should not be as dry as a textbook—they&#39;re also mildly insulting when they&#39;re done on pages I wrote. I know I&#39;m not perfect, and I don&#39;t mind edits that improve clarity or straighten out backward phrasing, but editing simply because you would have used different words to say the same thing is not cool. Please don&#39;t.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Of course, I&#39;d need to consult with Randa on letting someone borrow her agent... If there was a mission I&#39;d give you, it would probably be the one with the Sue who turned into a loin. It&#39;s short and, best of all, you wouldn&#39;t need to worry about pretty background art due to the lack of description the setting got. ;)<br><br>Also, lucky you!

            <p>...the thing is, my missions are so ridonkeybonkulously (is that even a word?) long that making comics of them could take months, if not years. For example, the first one - and the most likely to be adapted for the sake of character introduction - is 87 pages long, and in comic form it&#39;d practically be a graphic novel!<br><br>My collab with eatpraylove may be short enough to qualify, though.

            <p>First of all, though, do you and/or your friend have permission to write PPC stories? You&#39;d need that to write a comic about your agents, too, since it would still be a thing set in the PPC universe.<br><br>That said, two questions:<br><br>1. Do you have samples of your work posted somewhere we could take a look?<br><br>2. What exactly do you need in a script that you wouldn&#39;t get working straight from the text of an existing mission?<br><br>Finally, a word of caution: Others have attempted to make PPC comics in the past, and aside from Generic Surface, which was made with photos of Lego sculptures, none have succeeded that I&#39;m aware of. Writing a mission is a lot of work, and illustrating one would be a lot MORE work. I hope you know what you&#39;re getting into!<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

With that now sorted, we can start producing stories.<br><br>  In the way of easily showing my art, my DA hasn&#39;t updated since I&#39;ve had it, and my Tumblr. is still under serious construction.<br>That being said, I will be uploading a lot more recent and *E-HERM* better drawn art.

            <p>So. Who wants to present fan theories on their favorite works of fiction? Doesn&#39;t matter how huge or minor the theory is, how crazy, or how obscure the fandom is. Bring &#39;em in.<br><br>And hey, I actually have one from A Song of Ice and Fire that I thought of myself.<br><br>Readers of this series: You know the one-eared black tomcat that&#39;s hanging around the Red Keep? I think I know his name: Balerion. I believe that the cat that wreaks petty (ha) havoc on Robert&#39;s court is Rhaenys&#39; kitten, all grown up and angry at the people that killed his owner. Of course, he&#39;s just a cat, so he can&#39;t do much more than irritate people. He is a significant nuisance, though, and he does attack ravens... I wonder if that means anything... naaaah, couldn&#39;t be!</p>

Both are nearly-invisible specks in the air, not pulled down by gravity. Both are capable of rational thought, at least in large numbers, but can&#39;t communicate except by convoluted methods (memory chips, psychic crazy girls). And, of course, the episode titles of &#39;Forest of the Dead&#39; and &#39;(In the) Forest of the Night&#39; are pretty close together.<br><br>Yes, the Vashta Nerada were malevolent, while the Here protected the earth - but both acted in response to a threat to their habitat. In the Library, they were living in processed wood, which can&#39;t have been very comfortable for them if they&#39;re intimately connected to trees. People wandering around <i>reading</i> the books was a threat to them. Back on Earth, the solar flare would have wiped them out; they weren&#39;t protecting humanity per se, so much as their own ecosystem.<br><br>And of course there&#39;s one other related species (in the new series): given another five billion years of evolution, the Vashta Nerada will learn to inhabit and &#39;awaken&#39; the trees they&#39;re linked to. Ultimately, their line will lead to the Forest of Cheem, and to <a href="http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Jabe">Jabe</a>, who was present when the sun finally overwhelmed the Earth.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Coming to you live from the dimmer recesses of my brain and bits of a mostly-forgotten physics education, may I present:<br><br>The magic of <i>Harry Potter</i> is actually a quantum field effect with observable results in a macro-scale universe.<br><br>Hear me out on this. The Potterverse is a strange, strange place at the best of time, but one of the more consistent bits of weirdness is the idea - patently wrong - that &quot;Muggle technology&quot; doesn&#39;t work at Hogwarts. Okay, I get that J.K. probably meant &quot;Muggle science&quot; by that (which doesn&#39;t really work either, unless - ah, but that&#39;s a discussion for another day), but she used a specific term and I&#39;m running with it.<br><br>See, Muggle technology does work in the Wizarding World. We see the great spinning gear setups and locking-bars of the vault doors at Gringotts - mechanisms that work in harmony with magical defences, including whatever the Thief&#39;s Downfall is and a <i>dragon</i> (of the non-literal-five-headed variety). Hagrid has a dirty great crossbow firing bolts the size of a small tree, and crossbows (even hand-draw ones) are complicated bits of kit. The Flying Ford Anglia seems perfectly content in the grounds, though I&#39;m not too super-duper sure that that one counts since it&#39;s kept going by magic kind of sorta maybe a bit but the headlights work and guh weird.<br><br>So, we know that mechanical stuff works. We also see in the films that Luna&#39;s knackered Converse (her trackie bottoms tucked in socks, alas, remain unpictured; anyone getting that reference deserves prizes) don&#39;t dissolve or anything, so we can safely assume that modern materials like plastics and so forth aren&#39;t subject to the effects. However, I&#39;d wager that with the advent of portable electronics - presumably battery-operated torches, Walkmans, boomboxes, digital alarm clocks, and so forth, I mean, it&#39;s set from the early-Seventies to mid-Nineties - stuff started going haywire. Why?<br><br>Field interference.<br><br>See, if we look at magic as an observable phenomenon able to be replicated under laboratory conditions, which it is, assuming there&#39;s a wizard in the lab, it becomes obvious. &quot;Magic&quot; is some sort of deeply weird quantum field - and since every field has an associated particle, that&#39;s what is interacting with the electronic artifacts brought into Hogwarts by Muggleborn students. If we also assume that magic particles - which I&#39;ll call &quot;thaums&quot; for convenience and because I, like everyone else here, am a colossal nerd - act like neutrinos, permeating the world around them and passing through like it ain&#39;t no thang. However, they disrupt other fields... like the electromagnetic field, for instance. Like the one you use to read this and parse it into knowledge, also known as brain activity.<br><br>Major disruptions would probably cause strokes and so forth, but there&#39;s going to be a subset of people who can use it for some biological advantage. But that brings up the old saw of &quot;Why isn&#39;t magic evolutionarily selected for?&quot; To which I respond: see previous sentence. Perhaps the rates of strokes and brain damage and so forth were too great in those hypersensitive to this field - something that, even after the advent of effective medical care (which, for all its faults, the Wizarding World got to long before the Muggle one did) - meant that for the longest time, the trait was simply unprofitable from a genetic standpoint. But then someone figures out a healing spell, and everything changes.<br><br>BTW, healing spells and stuff that directly affects living matter, like transfiguration? I&#39;d wager that was the first stuff to be discovered... though probably after some kind of proto-Killing Curse. People are warlike. I haven&#39;t got that much more to say on that, tbh. It doesn&#39;t interest me<br><br>Now, though... now there are effective treatments. It&#39;s like a genetic defect that people live with, like a tendency towards sickle-cell anaemia or something, it just happens to come with the side effects of flying broomsticks and magical creatures (which I accept this theory does little to explain, though I&#39;d wager they came first). Magic users are, through good old genetic altruism, allowing other magic users to survive and thrive, getting a hold of their powers so that their heads do not a splode. Perhaps that&#39;s what Merlin was, the last of the <i>really</i> sensitive wizards. Perhaps magic&#39;s slowly coming back, finding a level between Muggle and &quot;Ka-Boom Oopsie There Go My Eyeballs&quot; that&#39;s suitable for further recreation.<br><br>There&#39;s an awful lot of perhapses here, but I think it&#39;s okay.<br><br>Also, this is wobblestheclown, rebranded and revamped and hopefully less of an angry tosspot this time around.<br><br>=]</p>

            <p>Well, most people don’t think of wedges and screws as &quot;technology&quot;, but where did you get &quot;Muggle technology doesn&#39;t work at Hogwarts&quot; anyway? I only remember Hermione saying &#39;All those substitutes for magic Muggles use – electricity, and computers and radar, and all those things – they all go haywire around Hogwarts, there’s too much magic in the air&#39; (GF 28). Since computers and radar and, by extension, &quot;all those things&quot; use electricity, Hermione apparently doesn’t believe that non-electric Muggle technology doesn’t work at Hogwarts. <br><br>I always wondered whether Hermione got this wrong, JKR didn’t think it through, or this is a deliberate setup for a future change in Muggle-wizard-relationships.<br><br>If Hermione got it wrong or was misled by <i>Hogwarts: A History</i>, which is not always accurate, the teachers may have set up some anti-electronics charms to prevent &quot;Gaming Boys&quot; and &quot;Walking Men&quot; disturbing their lessons and distracting the students from their homework.<br><br>If magic interferes with electricity, then every electric device is a crude magic-detector. Muggles would realize that such things like cell phones don’t work in certain areas of London (around the Ministry of Magic, and probably St. Mungo’s). Muggle scientists wouldn’t think of magic, but they would investigate, and find periodic fluctuations correlated to rush hours (when hundreds of employees apparate to or from the MoM). Since sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic, and sufficiently researched magic is indistinguishable from science, in the end it wouldn’t matter whether the scientists call spell casters &quot;wizards&quot; or &quot;human sources of anti-electronic quantum fields&quot;.<br><br>Does the MoM monitor scientific publications? Would they be aware of such research and try to stop it? Even if some scientists were obliviated, the accumulated data would still be there and could be found by other scientists. What do wizards know about sensor networks, cloud computing, and the world-wide web? To prevent Muggles learning about magic, the wizards would need to learn much more about Muggles, so either way their relationship would change.<br><br>I never considered that using magic might interfere with brain activity in other ways than deliberately casted spells, but now I think that you are on something there.<br><br>Dr. rer. nat. Hieronymus Graubart, future Nobel prize candidate for discovering the mathematics of magic. (Not really. &quot;The Mathematics of Magic&quot; already exists, but since it is a novella by L. Sprague de Camp and Fletcher Pratt, it is called &quot;Arithmancy&quot; in the Potterverse.)</p>

            <p>I was fairly certain it came up across the series that magic and electronics don&#39;t mix, but the thing is, wedges and screws <i>are</i> technology. A simple <i>lever</i> is technology. It&#39;s something artificial that does something the human body cannot do.<br><br>Also, this might just be me, but I&#39;ve seen plenty of fics where magic just stops any and all technology from working. It&#39;s at the to the point where I wonder if the authors have <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dresden_Files">got the wrong Harry</a>.<br><br>Personally, though, I was thinking that once Muggles caught up - about now-ish would be a pretty good bet for that to happen, or at least in the next decade or so - to the point where the Statute of Secrecy was pretty pointless, they&#39;d just get rid of it. Part of the reason for it given by a few people (I forget exactly who) is that Muggles would constantly badger them for magical solutions to Muggle problems, which seems plausible until you realise that just makes you a race of fantastic washing-machine repairmen. Magic can do so much more than that, and I reckon that once the Statute DOES come down (I have no idea how well Unplottable landscapes show up on satellite imaging, but it&#39;s probably not a risk anyone wants to take) then a lot of Muggleborn wizards and witches will take part in research programs. If nothing else, it&#39;s more beer vouchers for uni. =]<br><br>As an aside, given that Arthur Weasley is supposed to be a foremost expert on Muggle tech at the Ministry&#39;s Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office, I think we can safely say that they&#39;re not exactly getting copies of physics journals in the letterbox. For one thing, they tend to be fairly weighty things, and frankly that&#39;d be animal cruelty. =]</p>

            <p>Wedges and bolts <i>are</i> technology. I wondered whether JKR may have said in an interview that magic and Muggle technology don’t mix, because she said a lot of nonsense when she didn’t have time to think about it, or to look up which subplots only existed in her mind and which had actually made it into the books.<br><br>As far as I’m aware, Hermione’s retort to Harry’s suggestion that Rita &quot;The Bug&quot; Skeeter might have &quot;bugged&quot; Hogwarts is the only canonical reference to &quot;magic and electronics don&#39;t mix&quot;. Fanon may have blown this up to &quot;all technology stops working when magic is involved&quot;. I wouldn’t know. I actually don’t read much fan fiction. Rereading the books and filling the plot holes is more satisfying.<br><br>&quot;Muggles would constantly badger <s>them</s> [us] for magical solutions to Muggle problems.&quot; That would be Hagrid (translated from Hagrid-speech) answering Harry’s question in Chapter 5 of <i>Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone</i>. I read this as JKR’s way to avoid mentioning witch hunts in a children’s book. Witch hunts are only brought up in <i>Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban</i>, meant for a slightly older audience, and even then in a humorous way. I’ve always seen the Statute of Secrecy as an act of humanity. It was the only way to make Muggles forget that magic is real, so that they no longer burned each other based on wrong accusations. And that’s the problem with Muggles catching up – are we really so much more reasonable nowadays?<br><br>Unplottable regions and satellite imaging, electronic magic-detectors, Muggles catching up, wizards trying to stay hidden, or wizards abandoning the Statute of Secrecy – so much potential for fan fiction  set in the twenty-first century. I suppose it’s mostly unused, and all we get are next generation regurgitations of the original series?<br><br>HG</p>

            <p>There are constant (well, maybe not constant, but a few) references to characters checking their watches while at Hogwarts. The most notable example I can think of is how Harry mentions his watch stopped working after doing the Second Task. <br><br>I&#39;m pretty sure there&#39;s also a mention of Ron looking at his watch in the first book (outside the portrait of the Fat Lady when telling Hermione she&#39;d better not make them late for the duel) and probably other references I&#39;m forgetting.<br><br>Also, the magical community has been seen using enchanted clocks (like the Weasleys&#39;), magical watches (like Dumbledore&#39;s), enchanted cameras (like Colin&#39;s, the one Lockhart&#39;s photographer used, the one Rita Skeeter&#39;s photographer used...) and the radio (in the form of the Wizarding Wireless). It can also probably be inferred that they use enchanted printing presses to run off copies of the <i>Daily Prophet</i>. I feel like the Omnioculas ought to be mentioned as well, since they&#39;re basically ramped-up binoculars.</p>

            <p>We can safely assume that all the watches were using clockwork, which we know works (cf. Gringotts).

            <p>Anyway, wouldn&#39;t clockwork watches, theoretically, be able to be taken apart, dried, and put back together in working condition? Unless Harry either wasn&#39;t able to do that or didn&#39;t know how...  Maybe he wasn&#39;t able to; it&#39;s implied in the first book that he repaired his own alarm clock (since I highly doubt the Dursleys would get it fixed for him).</p>

            <p>If the Dursleys wanted Harry to get up on his own, so they didn’t need to wake him, they better had this clock fixed. If they didn’t want this, why did they buy him an alarm clock in the first place? <br><br><i>The repaired alarm clock rang at six o’clock the next morning</i> in PS/SS 3 is apparently the first time this clock is ever mentioned. When, where, and how was it broken? Maybe the Dursley’s didn’t buy it for Harry; it was an old spare clock they had lying around and it needed to be fixed because it had been out of use too long? Did Harry get it only when he moved into Dudley’s second bedroom? I cannot find this clock’s back story. Has it been edited out because the chapter was too long?<br><br>A random fourteen years old boy would probably not have the skills, tools and knowledge to put a wrist watch back together in working order, even if he could take it apart. A horologist could have done it if he got to it before the parts became too rusty, but Hogwarts students cannot go see an horologist every day, even if there is one in Hogsmeade.<br><br>Where did Harry get this watch? In PS/SS 2, <i>Harry lay in his dark cupboard much later, wishing he had a watch</i>. Madam Malkin’s robes are not magical; they are just out of style in the Muggle world. There may be a horologist in Diagon Alley who sells old-fashioned Muggle clockwork watches. Clearly magical devices, like one or both of the Weasley’s clocks and probably Dumbledore’s watch may have their own, unique back stories and may not be purchasable at Diagon Alley. <br><br>Collin Creevey’s Muggle parents may have bought him a magical camera at Diagon Alley, if the teacher who explained the Hogwarts letter to them realized that Collin is an enthusiastic photographer and thus warned them that his electronic camera wouldn’t work at Hogwarts. But it seems more plausible that Colin brought an old-fashioned photochemical Muggle camera. Since he said <i>‘if I develop the film in the right potion, the pictures’ll</i> move<i>’</i> (CS 6), I assume that all the magic is in the potion, and everything would work well, only the persons in the pictures wouldn’t move, if Collin used the usual Muggle developer chemicals. <br><br>But now thinking about it, Collin may have needed a magical, non-electronic flash for taking pictures inside the castle. Or there may be more magic in this magical developer potion than just making the persons in the pictures move. Wait, Lockhart’s photographer uses a flash at Flourish and Blotts. Is it magical or a very old-fashioned Muggle flash? I’m not very knowledgeable in this field, but the smoke from burning powdered magnesium should probably not be purple, so the wizards use something else?<br><br>Omnioculars and things like the Wizarding Wireless are probably like Alastor Moody’s artificial eye or the autonomous Snitch drone: Powered by Magic, we are not supposed to think about how it works.<br><br>HG</p>

            <p>That the flash mentioned in Chamber has a magical element to it, which may well be what causes it to move; the whole point of a flash is to illuminate a scene, so it makes sense that wizards would find a way to do it better since they&#39;re far more used to working with light thanks to spells and suchlike... and because wizards are an incurious bunch, they settled for refining the powder rather than using something else.<br><br>Also, you&#39;re forgetting the Occam&#39;s Razor solution that Hermione uses on Harry&#39;s glasses all the time. A simple <i>Reparo</i> will clear up a clockwork watch no end, and because there&#39;s no planned obsolescence in something like that (you literally cannot do that in a society that fixes things by magic), stuff like big fob-watches become status symbols - hence why wizards give watches as coming-of-age presents whereas Muggles get, Iunno, a car or something, my parents don&#39;t like me much so I haven&#39;t got a frame of reference.<br><br>Also also: one L in Colin Creevey.

            <p>As far as I remember, we have only ever seen <i>Reparo</i> mending things that were literally broken into pieces. I assume that it is a simple spell and cannot do more. Harry’s watch becoming wet and then becoming rusty is a more complex damage and would require a more complex spell, if there even is any. Oh, and an attempt to magically reassemble the watch after taking it apart would probably result in all moving parts sticking together, because that is what <i>Reparo</i> does.<br><br>To clarify the potions comment: I tried to suggest that the magical developer potion would not only make the persons on the pictures move, it would also magically increase the film&#39;s photo-sensitivity, so that Colin could get good pictures in a room lit only by candles.

A few years after he started as a Ranger, the Wizard of Darkness (a minor villain) created a clone of him, which ended up getting sent back to the 1700&#39;s.

            <p>We know that both Bill and Percy Weasley got twelve OWLs. Probably Barty Crouch Jr. also got twelve OWLs, although Barty Crouch Sr. may have talked about something he wishfully imagined. There may have been more unknown students who got twelve OWLs, and there should also be students who failed some OWLs, but had originally started to study twelve subjects in their third year. Why, then, did Hermione Granger need a Time-Turner in <i>Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban</i>, if it wasn’t just for conveniently having time travel available when it was needed? <br> <br>There are seven obligatory subjects:  Astronomy, Charms, Configuration, Defence Against the Dark Arts, Herbology, History of Magic, and Potions (not counting Flying, because this is only for the first year). In <i>Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone</i>, Chapter 14, Neville asks about Arithmancy and Ancient Runes, and Percy talks about Divination, Muggle Studies and Care of Magical Creatures, giving us a total of twelve subjects for the third year. Do we really know all optional subjects, or may there be at least one neither Percy nor Neville mentioned?<br> <br>In <i>Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets</i>, Chapter 4, Hermione shows Harry and Ron the books for all optional subjects: Arithmancy, Care of Magical Creatures, Divination, Study of Ancient Runes, Muggle Studies – and there she is conveniently interrupted by Ron. This is such a common trope that it practically shouts “There’s another optional subject not mentioned yet! Prepare for future surprises. “ <br> <br>In Chapter 6 of the same book, Ron tries to discuss how Hermione’s classes for  Divination, Muggle Studies and Arithmancy are at the same time on one day. Hermione reacts so annoyed that Ron never dares to discuss what else he might have seen on her timetable for other days. In Chapter 16, we see that Hermione has to sit double exams for Arithmancy and Transfiguration at Monday morning, and for Charms and Ancient Runes at Monday afternoon, but then Harry and Ron just give up and don&#39;t look at the other days, because there isn’t any point in asking how she’s going to do this. Is it possible that JKR deliberately avoided showing us full timetables because she knew that there had to be a sixth optional subject somewhere, but she had not yet decided what it would be? <br> <br>We never see Hermione’s full timetables in <i>Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire</i> either. Could JKR still not think of a plausible sixth optional subject, that wouldn’t be covered in other classes? Or did she forget that she had never actually said what it is?<br> <br>In <i>Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix</i>, Chapter 31, at the last morning of the OWL examinations, Harry sits in the common room, reading through the notes he had borrowed from Hermione. After the Astronomy examination, Hagrid’s sacking and the aftermath at the previous evening, Ron is sleeping long. But wouldn’t sleeping long like Ron be out of character for Hermione? Shouldn’t she be right there, sharing her notes with Harry to prepare for the examination in History of Magic? Where is Hermione if she isn’t sitting another exam for the still mysterious sixth optional subject?<br> <br>In <i>Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince</i>, Chapter 5, Harry, Ron and Hermione receive their OWL results. Hermione got ten &quot;Outstandings&quot; and one &quot;Exceeds Expectations&quot;. Since she gave up Divination and Muggle Studies when she returned the Time-Turner, Hermione had tried to do something that had never been accomplished before: studying thirteen subjects during her third year.<br> <br>So there is a good reason for giving Hermione a Time-Turner. No, it’s not for letting her try to get thirteen OWLs. It’s for teaching her these important lessons:<br>Magic cannot do everything.<br>Your Heart’s Desire may always be out of reach.<br>Even if you can add some extra hours to your day, it’s still impossible to learn everything that can be learned.<br> <br><b>Addendum 1:</b><br>Uh, what? A newer edition of <i>Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince</i> says that Hermione got only nine &quot;Outstandings&quot;? Did somebody complain that eleven OWLs for Hermione is WRONG and should be edited, because this would require her to have started studying thirteen subjects while there are only twelve subjects available? <br> <br>Fanon says that time travel isn’t really such a big secret and everybody who studies more than ten subjects at Hogwarts gets a Time-Turner. This theory is very popular because people just love to use time travel in their fan fiction. JKR tried to shoot it down on Pottermore, saying that time travel is really very dangerous and really top secret, and that Hermione was really the only student who ever used a Time-Turner at Hogwarts, but nobody believes her. That’s what you get when you listen to your readers and throw years of planning and deliberately writing around the mysterious subject out of the window because after so many years you don’t remember why the plot of your second book requires Hermione to get eleven OWLs in the sixth book. <br> <br>Unfortunately the Department of Inaccuracies, even if it existed, can’t do anything about this.<br> <br><b>Addendum 2:</b><br>Look, Ron, it isn’t too difficult. It took me only ten years, and I didn’t even lurk on Hermione’s timetables. BICIMTG is &quot;Basics of Interspecies Communication: Introduction to Mermish, Troll and Gobbledegook&quot;. <br> <br>It’s sufficiently magic, not covered in other classes, not requiring an additional teacher we have never seen, and Hermione never talked about it because she was just too curious whether Ron would ever figure it out on his own. (Thanks to Julia H. of the Harry Potter Lexicon Forum for suggesting that Professor Dumbledore could teach Mermish and probably also other languages.) <br> <br>HG</p>

            <p>when I expose you to My Pet Theory, Part 2: The Time-Turner Conspiracy.<br><br>Would McGonagall give a very dangerous and top secret Time-Turner to a thirteen year old student just to make her happy and let her have all the OWLs she wants to get? Certainly not!<br><br>Would McGonagall give a very dangerous and top secret Time-Turner to a thirteen year old student to teach her a specific lesson? I don’t think so.<br><br>But since time travel was so top secret, McGonagall couldn’t even know how this would end when she started it. She only knew that Hermione tried to sign up for every subject available. Then, something like this must have happened (Warning! Scripted badfiction copypasted from a several years old discussion thread):<br><br>DUMBLEDORE: You seem concerned, Minerva. Is there a problem? <br><br>McGONAGALL (presenting a piece of parchment): I am, Albus. I am and there is.<br><br>DUMBLEDORE (reading): So she couldn’t decide and signed up for everything. Is this a surprise?<br><br>McGONAGALL: I had hoped – this will never work, Albus! For two years we show our Muggle-born students how much can be done although Muggles deem it impossible. We convey that much more will be possible if they only work hard, but now I have to tell Miss Granger that her Heart’s Desire cannot come true because it’s impossible to fit into the class schedules!<br><br>DUMBLEDORE: But this isn’t the first time you have to do this, right? <br><br>McGONAGALL: In these other cases, I found something I could refer to. If Miss Granger had ever experienced a situation where magic was available but couldn’t help, we would know. Why should she believe me? <br><br>DUMBLEDORE: I’m sure Miss Granger will not assume that you intent to hurt her, or that you are just too lazy to do your work right. So what do you expect? <br><br>McGONAGALL: I would be less worried if she were more predictable. For months she is every teachers dream, but suddenly Miss Granger tries to catch a troll on her own. Or she helps Mr. Potter in a prank involving a fake dragon. Last Yule she tried to transfigure herself into a cat! (aside) Why didn’t she ask <i>me</i> first?<br><br>DUMBLEDORE: I don’t pretend to understand everything that happens in this school. Miss Granger’s escapades may have better reasons than we know. But I can see your point.<br><br>McGONAGALL: Albus, isn’t there a way to show, rather than tell Hermione, that this is really impossible? Otherwise I can’t foresee what this refusal might do to her mental health.<br><br>DUMBLEDORE: There is no way as far as I’m aware, but I will think about it and I may ask for advice. If you excuse me now, I have some letters to write.<br><br>--- scene break ---<br><br>McGONAGALL(reading a letter): Did you know that the Ministry is actually researching time travel?<br><br>DUMBLEDORE: How could I know? Everything done at the DOM is top secret.<br><br>McGONAGALL: So your friend suggests using a Time-Turner to let Miss Granger take two lessons at the same time. Wouldn’t this be dangerous? Nobody is supposed to change history!<br><br>DUMBLEDORE: Since Miss Granger would just do what she already intends to do, she wouldn’t really <i>change</i> anything. There shouldn’t be much danger.<br><br>McGONAGALL (reading out loud): <i>Since nobody yet considered that there should be a law prohibiting the use of Time-Turners by under-aged persons or outside of the DOM, this would technically not be illegal.</i> Ha! Your friend is a Slytherin, right? <i>But this should still be kept secret, and for my own safety in case of a breach of security, I need sincere affirmation that your student is an honourable person dedicated to her studies who will strictly limit the use of this Time-Turner to educational purposes only.</i> Didn’t you tell him that this girl’s unpredictability is the main problem?   <br><br>DUMBLEDORE: So the crucial question is: Do <i>we</i> trust her?<br><br>McGONAGALL: I wouldn’t even trust myself. There may always be a situation when you can save a life by doing a minimal adjustment to what just happened – so what would you do?<br><br>DUMBLEDORE: I’ll try to get all information about previous experiences with Time-Turners. Miss Granger has to know exactly what can be done and what shouldn’t be attempted. Then I’ll trust her to do nothing unreasonable. And it’s ‘her’, by the way.<br><br>McGONAGALL: What? Oh, this signature is as unreadable as you would expect from an ‘unspeakable’. But don’t try to distract me. This is all quite illogical. If we depend on Miss Granger being reasonable anyway, wouldn’t it be better to just tell her that she can’t study more than twelve subjects?<br><br>DUMBLEDORE: Not at all, Minerva, not at all! <i>You</i> warned <i>me</i> that this may be a turning point in Miss Granger’s life, and you know quite well that even well-thought decisions may have terrible consequences. Why would you take a risk?<br><br>McGONAGALL: Because we have to take a risk anyway! I just want to point out that it may be better to abandon this unnecessary complex project.<br><br>DUMBLEDORE: Maybe, but when did we ever miss such an opportunity to experience something new? How long do you reckon will Miss Granger need to learn her special lesson? I’ll bet she’ll hand the Time-Turner in before the spring holidays arrive.<br><br>McGONAGALL: Bet? Albus, this isn’t a game!<br><br>DUMBLEDORE: Life is too severe to take it always serious.<br><br>-------------<br><br>Their speech patterns and behaviour may be out of character, but I hope their attitude isn’t.<br> <br>HG</p>

Deeply religious, hugely magical, a true connection with his gods (he&#39;s a crannogmen, so he knows the secrets of the children), and (more directly related to Melisandre), he has some connection with one of the implied Princes that were Promised (namely Jon Snow).

            <p>I know, I know - you thought he was all about the gold. And yeah, he likes the pretty jewellery as much as anyone. But Smaug is actually a vigilante anti-hero: righter of ancient wrongs, punisher of the guilty for their heinous crimes against dragonkind.<br><br>In the First Age, when Melkor still ruled as rightful king over Middle-earth, the dragons had their beginning. The greatest among them were Glaurung the Golden - the Father of Dragons - and Ancalagon the Black, first of the winged variety. Smaug, of course, must be descended from both of them, since he&#39;s winged (and a dragon); he also clearly <i>identifies</i> with Glaurung, since he&#39;s adopted the same aftername - &#39;the Golden&#39;, or &#39;Glуren&#39; in Sindarin.<br><br>In all the years of the First Age, there were two occasions when dragons were defeated in major battles. First, when Glaurung fought in the Nirnaeth Arnoediad, he was driven back to Angband in disgrace by masked dwarves. Second, when Ancalagon sallied forth in glory in the War of Wrath, he was brought down in ruin by the bearer of a Silmaril.<br><br>So imagine how Smaug feels when, after millennia of brooding on these ancient wrongs, he hears that a mountain full of dwarves (Glaurung&#39;s bane) have dug up a glowing jewel bearing more than a passing likeness to the Silmarilli (Ancalagon&#39;s last sight). At last, there is a chance to exact vengeance for the great dragons of old - and, along the way, to burn down a city of scruffy mortals very similar to the one who (wearing a dwarven helm, mark you) slew Glaurung the Golden himself.<br><br>And so Smaug the Avenger flew down from the North in flame, and all burned before his righteous wrath.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I have a whole bunch of headcanons about most of my fandoms!  Some are more crazy than others.  <br><br>One Harry Potter headcanon that I have has to do with the reason why no one reported for the Dursley&#39;s for child abuse.  If the obvious neglect and abuse had been reported, he would have been removed from the Dursley&#39;s home from the British equivalent of CPS.  But then that would have broken the protection that he had from being there- in his mother&#39;s family&#39;s house- and it would be entirely possible that Harry would be at risk from Death Eaters harming him.  My headcanon is that the abuse he suffered was noticed and reported.  But the British CPS didn&#39;t investigate for whatever reason; probably an obliviate or two, and probably cast by Dumbledore- all a way to keep Harry alive until it was the right time for him to die, after all the Horcruxes were destroyed.  <br><br>My craziest headcanon is for the Marvel universe. I believe that Age of Apocalypse Blink is really Pixie and Nightcrawler&#39;s daughter.  Pixie isn&#39;t seen in AoA; but both Pixie and Kurt are teleporters.  A pink teleporter plus a blue teleporter equals a purple teleporter.  Plus, Pixie&#39;s pink hair is genetic; her mother has the same hair color, so it&#39;s plausible that her daughter will have pink hair as well.  Blink also has eyes that are one solid color, just like Kurt.  It is also implied that Sabretooth is Kurt&#39;s father in the AoA universe; if Blink was Kurt&#39;s daughter (and thus Sabretooth&#39;s granddaughter) it would explain why Sabretooth took her in.  <br><br>Those are the two big ones that I can think of at the moment.  If I think of any more I&#39;ll post them later!  </p>

            <p>Dunbledore was certainly not above obliviating some Muggles if he deemed it necessary.<br><br>But weren’t the Dursleys always so concerned with what the neighbours would think of them? Wouldn’t they have tried to avoid anything that might have been noticed?<br><br>Yes, sometimes Vernon lost his temper and tried to beat Harry, so Harry learned to duck and to stay out of reach. But I’m not so sure that Vernon ever actually hit Harry; he may always have missed.<br><br>The original protection Harry got through his mother’s sacrifice worked only against Voldemort. But when Dumbledore worked his magic to give Harry extended protection at the place where his mother’s blood dwelled, why would he limit it to Death Eaters and Dementors, risking that some random mass murderer not associated with Voldemort might slaughter Harry and his family? Why would he set any limits at all?<br><br>My headcanon: Dumbledore didn’t need such crude spells like Obliviate to make the world go the way he wanted it to go. Having Harry been monitored by Mrs. Figg was mostly to keep track of what happened to Harry when he left the house. Dumbledore had made sure that no real harm could be done to Harry at Number 4, Privet Drive, and that any abuse Harry might have to suffer would only serve to make him stronger and to form the character we know, but would never go so far to make Child Protection come in and make Harry loose the best protection he could have.  <br><br>Note: I’m not saying that what happened to Harry was not bad, and certainly he perceived it as <i>really</i> bad, but it could have been worse.<br><br>HG</p>

            <p>However, my own headcanon is slightly different.<br><br>See, the Dementor&#39;s Kiss sucks out your soul, right? There&#39;s no real evidence to prove that they eat them, since they &quot;feed&quot; off happy memories. It could just be a reproductive system, in that the soul sucked out undergoes sufficient torment to become a Dementor over time, incubating beneath the shroud of the adult form until such time as it is free to leave and seek new victims, new things to devour, constantly searching for the happiness and warmth of memories now denied it...<br><br>Er, er, here&#39;sakitten!

            <p>I know this doesn&#39;t have anything to to the PPC canon (aside from the obvious theme of Sue hunting), but I&#39;ve been meaning to bring this up... Has anyone around here read <a href="http://indiemadnesse.sandwich.net/extract/extract.html">&quot;Self-Extraction&quot;</a>? It&#39;s a pretty... interesting take on the idea of Mary Sue slayers, involving a corporation that the canons of affected universes actually contact to get rid of the Sues/Stus in question (usually people who live out their fantasies in the universe of their choice). It&#39;s actually a really interesting idea, and it&#39;s also one of the very earliest works I ever read pertaining to the topic of Sue slaying. (I must warn you, though: The content presented is not for the faint of heart. There would probably be an M-rating for this thing, and for a damn good reason.)<br><br>Anyway, may I ask what any of you folks think about it? The part in the Sonic universe where the Stu blows himself up by mistake was my favorite part, personally.</p>

            <p>I don&#39;t have the time (way too many plot bunnies) and I don&#39;t think that I could do this idea justice, but perhaps someone here will be willing to take up the challenge:<br><br>Summary: A girl from the modern world is inexplicably dumped into Mirkwood. She has only basic wilderness survival skills, doesn&#39;t know the language, and she&#39;s scared of spiders. This is going to suck.<br><br>Longer explanation: A more realistic take on the Girl-Falls-Into-Middle-Earth cliche. The main character ends up in Mirkwood, and while she has some survival skills, it basically amounts to &#39;anything you could learn as a Girl Scout&#39;, and her combat skills cannot be more than &#39;knows recreational archery&#39; and/or &#39;has some martial arts training&#39;. She doesn&#39;t join the Fellowship, and this should be a mostly OC story (or focus on minor characters in the books). It&#39;s mostly a story of a lost, scared girl struggling to survive in an unfamiliar land and adjust to the loss of everyone she knew and loved, not an epic adventure story like Tolkien&#39;s masterpiece.<br><br>So, how does it sound? </p>

            <p>Good Girl-falls-into-Middle-earth fic has been done in that sense, with Don&#39;t Panic by Boz4PM and (I think?) Time Will Tell by Bombur Jo.<br><br>I&#39;ve tried doing it for Mirkwood too but that didn&#39;t go well, but I&#39;m sure it can be done. Since Mirkwood isn&#39;t really on the route of the Fellowship the closest she&#39;d get to the Quest is if she rides to Rivendell with Legolas. I think doing Girl-Falls-Into-Middle-earth for Mirkwood would actually be interesting if someone took the time and effort to research and extrapolate to create an interesting world for the Wood-elves of Mirkwood. There&#39;s a lot that isn&#39;t covered in the books, so there&#39;s a lot to discover. Especially if she isn&#39;t turned into an elf or something and there&#39;s discussion of turning her over to the Lake-men or the people of Dale. Then you can do even more world-building, since there isn&#39;t a whole lot about the era between reclaiming the Lonely Mountain and the War of the Ring. </p>

            <p>The idea with the story is to not get anywhere near the quest. The point is to use her newbie-ness to explore the parts of Middle Earth that the canon story couldn&#39;t touch. She doesn&#39;t get to meet Legolas up close and personal (or at least, he&#39;s a minor character), but she does get to explore the land of Middle Earth that currently isn&#39;t embroiled in a war on which the fate of the world rests. Also, I think that Dale is a pretty cool place.</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve always been a bit iffy on creative curses like &quot;Flaming Denethor&quot; or &quot;Jadis in a block of ice.&quot; They always felt unwieldy in most situations. I&#39;m pretty sure I&#39;ve written a post saying as much sometime before now, but my thoughts have evolved a bit. I think writing that workshop on speech helped.<br><br>Characterization shapes how someone speaks (and a bit of vice versa). Dialogue and word choice are informed by a character&#39;s background and personality. That means by extension, characterization also shapes how someone swears. Hot-headed Laura Dukes and happy-go-lucky Rachel Calendar are not necessarily going to be using the same curse words at the same rate.<br><br>The vast majority of curses are quick, forceful expressions. Even the invented fictional ones typically are: shazbot, frak, frell, bosh&#39;tet, and so on. Big elaborate curses like &quot;Radagast on a bunny sled&quot; only work if they seem like something the character would say. I typically associate such profanity with either very large hams, the vaguely eccentric, or certain period piece characters. I could hear Bertie Wooster saying something like that, for example. (&quot;Great Radagast on a bunny sled, Jeeves!&quot;) <br><br>Such phrases don&#39;t feel right coming out of the mouths of most agents, who are typically contemporary young adults. As such, having them say something like &quot;Scottish Dain on a battle pig&quot; feels a bit too much like the author stepping in and inserting something they think is humorous just because they can. It&#39;s very forced, in my view.</p>

            <p>Sorta like how people say stuff like &quot;Jesus on a pogo stick&quot; or &quot;Great Goddess on a stick&quot; or &quot;In the name of God&#39;s green Earth&quot;, but adjusted for fandoms. Also agents who originate in certain continua might have curses stylised like those expressions but more befitting their origin canon, or agents who spend a lot of time in those continua pick things up.<br><br>So it&#39;s not necessarily something quick and forceful like the one-word curses that we all know and love, but more of an expression of long-winded exasperation, when you&#39;re completely done and exhausted by the antics of the Sue but you can&#39;t kill her yet, so all you can say is &quot;Oh, for the love of Scottish Dain Ironfoot&quot; in an exasperated voice and clutch your forehead.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m being completely serious. I&#39;ve never heard someone say &quot;Jesus on a pogo stick&quot; in real life. The most common expressions of exasperation or dismay that I&#39;ve heard are typically phrases like &quot;Are you serious?&quot; or &quot;For f*ck&#39;s sake&quot; or the ever popular quiet murmur of &quot;...oh my God.&quot;<br><br>You say &quot;more befitting their origin canon, or agents who spend a lot of time in those continua pick things up.&quot; If that were the case, why wouldn&#39;t they just pick up canonical curse words or phrases? I&#39;m pretty sure no one actually says &quot;For the love of Scottish Dain Ironfoot&quot; in Middle Earth. Agents from that canon would have no reason to use it. Outside agents with a lot of experience working in Middle Earth would more logically adopt Dwarvish oaths, Orcish profanity, or what have you. Fans of the canon working there might use such phrases, but they wouldn&#39;t come from the canon itself.</p>

            <p>I mean, maybe I spend too much time with the Tumblr crowd who love coming up with really creative insults and curses that don&#39;t involve gendered slurs, so I&#39;m just more accustomed to hearing/seeing/reading people call others &quot;useless paperclip&quot; and &quot;crinkled plastic bag&quot; and other ridiculous things.<br><br>It&#39;s all down to people&#39;s preferences. In fact, since the Potterverse has creative curses about Merlin&#39;s saggy buttcheeks, I&#39;m guessing people (Agents?) who like that kind of cursing would be into things like &quot;Scottish Dain Ironfoot&quot; and &quot;Thranduil on a Moose&quot;. Also, people who just aren&#39;t comfortable with swearwords, fictional or otherwise, or writers who want to keep their work more family-friendly (once again, the Potterverse cursing style comes to mind, and arguably even some PPC writers; I know in my early days of writing for the PPC I relied more heavily on weird phrases for curses because I was a sweet innocent spring chicken who hadn&#39;t become comfortable with dropping F-bombs everywhere yet) might use these. <br><br>Look, if it&#39;s your personal opinion that these curses are weird, that&#39;s your thing. But it&#39;s another to dismiss it as stuff people wouldn&#39;t say. My Agents (read: Christianne; Eledhwen uses phrases that are more Elvish) might be more comfortable using things like &quot;Radagast on a Bunny Sled&quot; than yours, and maybe that stems from their idea of what consists of verbal humour. </p>

            <p>Dialogue and word choice are informed by one&#39;s background and personality. That applies to real people as well.<br><br>Also, I did say that these curses sound strange coming from &quot;most agents.&quot; If your agents are characterized in such a way that it would make sense for them to use things like &quot;Radagast on a bunny sled&quot; -- not liking to swear being a good reason -- then they should be able to do so. Many of the occasions I&#39;ve seen such phrases used in missions, however, have come across as forced to me because it doesn&#39;t fit what I know of their characterization.

            <p>And I completely agree that the choice to use long creative curses is dependent on whether or not the agent/person in question knows the context of the curse and would have the personality to use the curse in lieu of other things. It&#39;s just that I read your comments as dismissive of the way some people speak, which really doesn&#39;t sit right with me.<br><br>There are times and contexts in which certain phrases can be used, and the writer in question shouldn&#39;t try to force it. But that doesn&#39;t mean bringing up new ridiculous things to turn into potential new curses is a bad thing; I&#39;m not saying that everyone needs to use &quot;Thorin on a Goat&quot; or &quot;for the love of Scottish Dain Ironfoot&quot; immediately in all of their missions now. It&#39;s just a chance to toss out what I found ridiculous about the last film in a PPC way.<br><br>That being said, Thorin on a Goat just brings up such hilarous mental images that I think I might start using it IRL.</p>

            <p>...may have been to remind the Abused!Legolas writers that yes, Thranduil <i>does</i> have a good hart.<br><br>Seriously, though, Melian did apparently learn a thing or two from Yavanna; the moose were probably domesticated in Doriath.

            <p>The idea of Melian being the ultimate source of the giant animals is appealing, though I can&#39;t think of any instance of the Doriathrim riding <i>anything</i>. And it doesn&#39;t need to conflict with my <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=266863;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">Dorwinion theory</a> - after all, we know from the <i>Lay of the Children of Hurin</i> that the dwarves of Nogrod and Belegost traded with a wine-producing country of that name, though it appears to have been in a different location.<br><br>So, the timeline goes like this:<br><br>-Melian sets up shop in Middle-earth.<br>-To ward off the giant creatures bred by Morgoth before his captivity (eg Wargs), she starts producing large variants of local animals, including the Dorthonion Moose, the hogs of Brethil, and the goats of the Andram.<br>-Elsewhere in Beleriand, south of Taur-im-Duinath, a group of Nandor reach the coast. They establish the land of Dorwinion, &#39;the country of new land&#39;.<br>-The dwarves of Nogrod and Belegost awake. They establish communications with their eastern kin.<br>-Eol the Dark Elf establishes trade and relations between the dwarves and the Doriathrim.<br>-For transportation, the dwarves purchase giant boars and goats from Doriath.<br>-The dwarves establish a trade route with Dorwinion, and make a lucrative profit selling their wine on to Doriath, and selling Doriathrim megabeasts to Dorwinion.<br>-Morgoth returns. The Girdle of Melian is laid. Trade mostly ceases with the dwarves (there is a war on, you know). Of course, the dwarves still trade cheerfully with Dorwinion, and get blind drunk on a regular basis.<br>-The dwarves use their megabeasts in battle, and strike an agreement with Dorwinion: the southern elves will breed and train the things, then sell them to the dwarves.<br>-In time, the War of Wrath comes about. Nogrod and Belegost are destroyed, and their remnants flee to Khazad-Dum. Doriath is lost. Dorwinion is flooded, and their population flees east, following in the footsteps of a certain Oropher and his son Thranduil.<br>-Dorwinion 2.0 is established on the Sea of Rhun. Since, unlike Oropher (late of Doriath, which does <i>not</i> like dwarves these days), they would be perfectly happy to pass through Khazad-Dum, they establish a new megabeast trade with the Longbeards. They also become friends with the elves of Lorien (long before Galadriel shows up, of course).<br>-Durin&#39;s Folk continue to trade with Dorwinion; when Khazad-Dum falls, the dwarves retreat towards their allies: first setting up shop in Erebor, then moving north to the Grey Mountains, then back to Erebor.<br>-With the dwarves so close, and using cavalry, Thranduil creates a cavalry of his own. Since horses aren&#39;t much use in the forest, he invites experts from Dorwinion up to breed him the giant moose he vaguely remembers from his childhood in Doriath.<br>-Erebor falls to Smaug. The dwarves are (to Thranduil&#39;s mind) a spent force in the Iron Hills. With cavalry now useless, Thranduil downsizes them - keeping just one moose for his own purposes.<br><br>Are the people of Dorwinion of the Third Age human or elven? Probably the former, by this point - but with a hint of elven blood like that of Dol Amroth, and several millennia of contact with the dwarves and their megabeasts to keep them looking weird to the rest of the world.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I have a theory that Peter Jackson has an overwhelming compulsion to make Legolas ride on things.<br><br>Think about it. He kept it down during <i>Fellowship</i> by thinking really hard about the boating scene, and by working out the tension during the Moria staircase surf (which I don&#39;t think involved Legolas, but I might be wrong). Then in <i>Two Towers</i> he let himself go a bit - Legolas got to ride on a horse, naturally, but also went shield-surfing at the Hornburg. By <i>Return of the King</i>, nothing could satisfy PJ but letting Legolas surf an entire Mumak (after riding on a boat and, oh yeah, an avalanche of skulls). Only a vestigal respect for the plot forced him to keep Legolas off the giant eagles at the end.<br><br>But okay, films over. He figured he&#39;d gotten over it. Positive thinking and all that. Then <i>The Hobbit</i> comes up. Okay, fine. Deep breaths, Peter. He&#39;s not even in the first one - it&#39;ll be fine. You can do this. Good, good, we&#39;re past Rivendell, into the Misty Mountains...<br><br>... oh gods, this Stone Giant sequence is just like the staircase surf.<br><br>And from then on, the compulsion overwhelmed him. Trees, barrels full of dwarves, rooftops, probably boats and orcs as well, Legolas jumped on <i>everything</i> in <i>Desolation</i>. And by the time <i>Five Armies</i> rolled round, he simply couldn&#39;t keep himself from throwing Legolas onto falling towers, into the sky for bat-joyrides, <b><i>up a load of freefalling stonework as if it were a staircase</i></b>...<br><br>(On the other hand, would it be a PJ!M-e film if Legolas <i>didn&#39;t</i> engage in increasingly ridiculous stunts? And anyway, he made up for it all with the &#39;whoops, empty quiver&#39; shot. Orli&#39;s <i>face</i>, good grief)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I think Orli&#39;s contract consists mostly of looking around in an attempt to seem mysterious and wise, pulling faces in the background, and doing ridiculous stunts. <br><br>Speaking of ridiculous things, though, did anyone else think it was funny how the Elf-army spun around everyone who tried to walk through their ranks?

            <p>Doesn&#39;t Thorin&#39;s group do the goatlike &#39;hop vertically up a mountain&#39; trick?<br><br>Giant animals... well, let&#39;s see. Historically, both Morgoth and the Valar bred giant animals (Carcharoth and Huan, respectively). There&#39;s also the Kine of Araw, which were giant oxen; they lived around Rhun, but were supposedly descended from Orome&#39;s cows. I always figured they were <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurochs">aurochs</a>. And there is actually a giant boar in Middle-earth - the Boar of Everholt, which lived in Firienholt in Rohan, and was killed by Folca the king.<br><br>All of which suggests a theory, actually. The movie megafauna are:<br><br>-Mumakil<br>-The moose<br>-The boar<br>-The goats<br>-Technically the &#39;bats&#39;, though I&#39;ll come back to them.<br><br>All of those hail from the eastern areas of the world - the moose is the westernmost, and it&#39;s still way east. We know that Dain (in the movies) has contact with the other families of the dwarves, who live out east. We know that Thranduil has trade with Dorwinion (he drinks their wine) by way of Esgaroth - and Dorwinion is on the shores of Rhun.<br><br>So to answer your question: there is strong movie evidence that large animals live in the eastern lands - around Rhun, and also to the south of Mordor in the case of the Mumakil. Most of that territory is under Sauron&#39;s rule (by way of Khamul the Ringwraith at the time of <i>The Hobbit</i>); those areas which <i>aren&#39;t</i> would be struggling for any advantage over the Eastern Shadow. So yeah, breeding giant war steeds might well be a thing they did. And when you&#39;ve got a breeding program, selling bits of it off is always worth considering.<br><br>Though, since I don&#39;t recall seeing any sign of Thorin&#39;s goats before he suddenly jumped on one - maybe those in particular are actually automata dug up from deep inside the Mountain? They certainly didn&#39;t seem to come in with Dain&#39;s company...<br><br>~<br><br>As for the bats - those did <i>not</i> look like bats to me. They looked more like Morgoth&#39;s fearsome flying messengers, the <a href="http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Vampire">vampires</a> - which we know Sauron once had command over (at least in part), and could transform into... hey, he&#39;s still using Wargs, why shouldn&#39;t he have a vampire breeding program in place too?<br><br>~<br><br>And, creative curses? &quot;Oh, <i><b>were-wyrms!</b></i>&quot;<br><br>hS<br><br>(&quot;We&#39;ve got were-wyrm sign!&quot; Come on, I can&#39;t have been the only one thinking that)</p>

            <p>Dwarves are about 4 ft/122 cm tall, right? Domestic hogs, some of which are very shaggy, can be up to 6 ft/180 cm long and 770 lb/350 kg with tusks up to 9 inches long. That&#39;s while breeders are not trying to see how big they can go. The ideal commercial pig of today is slim and low fat, quick gaining, and as docile as possible.  <br><br>Look at Google images of feral pigs in the US. They are all descended from domestic pigs, but are huge and shaggy. The biggest problem would be that the boars are for the most part viscious omnivores with massive sharp teeth. <br><br>How much bigger would one have to be for a dwarf to ride on it?<br><br>(Can&#39;t speak to the goats. I saw that part and nearly spit my pop corn out. I mean, maybe if they had shown a bunch of dwarves on them at the beginning of the battle, but those were like *hammer space goats!*)</p>

The, uh, precise details <i>may</i> have been contributed by Jackson et al.

The answer is really &#39;filmmaker didn&#39;t think of it&#39;, though in this case we could argue that the various troll/hyperorc superweapons were driven to near extinction by the B5A, and hadn&#39;t recovered for the War of the Ring.

            <p>Phobos and I got to talking about discrepancies between <i>The Hobbit</i> and <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> last night, such as why the trolls talk in <i>The Hobbit</i> but not LotR, and it occurred to me: what if Bilbo made that up? What if Bilbo embellished a <i>lot</i> of his tale? We know some things had to have happened based on what&#39;s reported in LotR, but we also know Bilbo wasn&#39;t entirely honest about the Ring, so why not other stuff? What must be true, and what could have been lightened up, left out, or added for the sake of a good yarn to tell his young nieces and nephews?<br><br>Regarding the trolls, we know there were trolls because Frodo and friends find them on the way to Rivendell, and they probably did capture and try to eat the dwarves... but I bet they didn&#39;t talk. What kept them from getting their meal before dawn, then? Gandalf? Blind luck? Or perhaps the dwarves weren&#39;t quite so helpless as Bilbo makes them out to be, and they actually put up a fight? That seems likely to me.<br><br>So, what else?<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

We know from all five hobbits that <i>orcs</i> talk, and in an idiom that Tolkien translated as something very close to how the trolls speak. Granted, they probably weren&#39;t named &#39;Bill &#39;uggins&#39;, but that&#39;s a translation issue too.<br><br>Wait, there&#39;s a 1.5 too/ That said, talking trolls are a part of Shire folklore - &#39;Troll sat alone on his seat of stone&#39; and so forth - so it&#39;s entirely the sort of thing Bilbo might have added.<br><br>2/ Other things Bilbo might have, uh, misrepresented: how about all that singing? We know <i>he</i> was very fond of songs, so we can accept that he would have sung a lot (though if memory serves, he doesn&#39;t). And the hobbits in his circle could well have caught the bug, so they&#39;re fine. In fact, all the songs in LotR are justifiable as a racial hobby (hobbits, elves, ents) or a special occasion (the Rohirrim). They also all fit the cultures they&#39;re in.<br><br>The songs in <i>The Hobbit</i>? Nnnnot so much. Singing orcs, singing dwarves, all of whom sing in Hobbittish ditties? Not a chance. I&#39;d guess <i>Far Over The Misty Mountains Cold</i> is a real song, but the rest of them are just Bilbo&#39;s pen running away with him.<br><br>3/ And it&#39;s not just Bilbo! The Middle-earth stories are semi-unique, in that <i>the writing of the modern book</i> is part of the fiction too. And that means <i>Tolkien</i> can be an unreliable narrator - or rather, a better novelist than he is translator.<br><br>For instance, we know that Bilbo&#39;s story started life as his diary - the title is still on the front cover. Who writes their diary in third person? I&#39;m guessing that Bilbo&#39;s entire work - and that&#39;s everything up to Frodo reaching Rivendell, mark you, since we know he caught up with Frodo then and wrote it all down - was written in first person, and (in the case of &#39;The Hobbit&#39;) as and when he had a chance to scribble something in.<br><br>So, for instance, everything from being captured by goblins to being rescued by eagles could&#39;ve been written at Beorn&#39;s house. Which means the early parts may have been quite quickly covered, since Bilbo probably forgot about the details. So Tolkien had to embellish.<br><br>For specific instance: the riddles. I&#39;ll accept that Bilbo wrote &#39;Got into riddling contest with slimy Thing. It asked me riddle about mountain. [etc] It asked me one that stumped me, and pressed me, so I called out for &quot;Time!&quot;, and that of course was the answer.&#39; But I refuse to believe he wrote down the actual riddles - which explains why some of them are Old English riddles.<br><br>Of course, the sparseness of Bilbo&#39;s account means that all Tolkien had to do was &#39;fill the gaps&#39;. When he got to Frodo&#39;s far more complete work, his changes got a little more... involved.<br><br><u>Things added by JRRT</u><br><br>-Boromir. Boromir exists solely to be a mirror of Aragorn - in fact, to allow Aragorn to sit firmly in the role of &#39;Anglo-Saxon hero&#39;, with none of that icky &#39;being tempted&#39;. But people don&#39;t actually come as mirrors. Clearly in the original, <i>Aragorn</i> tried to take the Ring - and didn&#39;t receive any punishment for it, but went on to rule the world.<br><br>-Faramir. Faramir consists in equal parts of mirror to Boromir (who never existed), plot device for feeding Frodo ( the real world doesn&#39;t have plot devices), and self-insert (need I say more?). We also have an explicit statement by Tolkien that he created him, so there&#39;s that. ;)<br><br>-Tom Bombadil. He&#39;s a children&#39;s doll, and Tolkien needed something to fill time. This of course means that Frodo&#39;s escape from the Barrow Downs was probably effected in some other manner. My theory is that the great disappearing character, Fatty Bolger, originally went with the other four - and then died in the Barrow. But that&#39;s too depressing, right?<br><br>-All the history. We know Tolkien was working on his Book of Lost Tales long before he got his hands on the Red Book. That means that <i>everything we know about the First Age</i> is a Tolkien invention - and its mentions in the narrative are either Tolkien additions, or changes to what was <i>really</i> said about history...<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I was raised on the BBC radio plays, myself. More LotR than <i>The Hobbit</i>, but both were a fixture of my bedtime routine for many years.

            <p>On the one hand, alicorn OC. That&#39;s, like, instant -20 goodfic points. On the other, this author seems serious. After all, they created a website for this series, with art and everything. Clearly, they mean business. Further, the author&#39;s note on the first chapter says that they know it is not the best, and is actively trying to fix it. <br><br>Seems to me like this fic should be left alone, at least for now.

            <p>I mean, for starters, if Smaug could do that, the entire plot of The Hobbit would be different.

            <p>In the event that this is legit, I think the author of the fic in question isn&#39;t just trying to tell a good story; they&#39;re trying to tell an <i>interesting</i> story about a bit of Middle-Earth history that wasn&#39;t covered at all in the primary material fangirls are familiar with. That&#39;s sort of what fanfiction is supposed to do. And they&#39;ve obviously done at least a little bit of research into the period, even if it is only to get the names right, so... yeah, if it&#39;s legit, then the author <i>doesn&#39;t know they&#39;re terrible</i>.<br><br>However, it being a trollfic makes more sense to me; the things that are wrong with it on the surface - quite the list - are cliched to the point of ridiculous. Endbringer&#39;s bones, if we ever figure out a way to burn speshul we&#39;re quids in with this one. And that&#39;s what says troll to me - it&#39;s badfic bad, but with actual research and effort... unless the author was already familiar with that bit of Arda&#39;s long and storied history, and just decided to dick around with it for a cheap laugh. =]<br><br>(Also, for Nesh&#39;s benefit: The L Words was a <i>Friendship Is Magic</i> darkfic I wrote a while back, which I now realise is terrible... and I am on record as defending it to the hilt.

            <p>I believe the author is well-intentioned, but very, very clueless. One of the first author&#39;s notes says something about how the fic is definitely very experimental, or something like that. She also says the main character isn&#39;t a self-insert at one point.<br><br>On the other hand, there&#39;s an author&#39;s note where she&#39;s agreeing with a reviewer that proper grammar is important, and it&#39;s so hard to read fics where people just ignore it, so yeah. I think it&#39;s a case of knowing, but not understanding. She&#39;s trying to write like Tolkien without knowing what makes Tolkien sound like Tolkien, so she uses overly complicated phrasing and throws in fancy words where they&#39;re not warranted.<br><br>Like &quot;albeit.&quot; Albeit is not a synonym for &quot;but&quot; or &quot;yet,&quot; and yet she uses it like that throughout. So annoying. &gt;.<br>(I don&#39;t know what the l words are, sorry if I mentioned any. o.o )<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I&#39;d be willing to come along for the ride. I&#39;ve wanted to feed a Sue to Ancalagon anyway, though my original idea for a leadup to it wouldn&#39;t work in this fic, since it depends on one of the agents not knowing who Ancalagon is. It goes something like this<br><br>Agent 1: &quot;I want to feed this Sue to a really big monster... and I know just the one.&quot;<br><br>Agent 2: &quot;Smaug?&quot;<br><br>Agent 1: &quot;Bigger.&quot;<br><br>Agent 2: &quot;Cthulhu?&quot;<br><br>Agent 1: &quot;Bigger.&quot;<br><br>(scene change, as they walk through the mountains)<br><br>Agent 2: &quot;Balerion?&quot;<br><br>Agent 1: That continuum&#39;s quarantined.

            <p>And we see yet another Boarder overcome the shackles of an old shame. Good work, Rina!<br><br>However, there are a few things amiss with the mission:<br><br>1) In this segment, it takes a while to figure out who said what in the middle paragraph:<br><br><i>&quot;Ooh, I wanna be in Hufflepuff!&quot; Randa said. Rina looked at her.<br><br>&quot;...said nobody in the history of forever,&quot; she said slowly. Randa kicked at her. &quot;Ow! Randa, you know I didn&#39;t mean that!&quot; Rina rubbed her shin. &quot;I like Hufflepuffs too, come on!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Hufflepuff,&quot; Randa said firmly.</i><br><br>I eventually figured out that all of the quotes in the middle paragraph are Rina&#39;s lines, but the paragraphing threw me off. (You have Rina react at the end of the first paragraph, then start a new paragraph with a quote, so I expected a change in speaker <i>back</i> to Randa. The &quot;she&quot; in the paragraph muddied the water even more. Only the context of the rest of the paragraph cleared everything up.) Please allow me suggest a fix:<br><br><i>&quot;Ooh, I wanna be in Hufflepuff!&quot; Randa said.<br><br>Rina looked at her. &quot;...said nobody in the history of forever,&quot; she said slowly.<br><br>Randa kicked at her.<br><br>&quot;Ow! Randa, you know I didn&#39;t mean that!&quot; Rina rubbed her shin. &quot;I like Hufflepuffs too, come on!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Hufflepuff,&quot; Randa said firmly.</i><br><br>This way, it&#39;s a lot clearer who said what.<br><br>2)<br><i>A horrible smell hit them just then; Rina peered out into the corridor. &quot;Here comes Peter,&quot; she said, one hand pressed over her nose, &quot;and he&#39;s covered in Stinksap.&quot; ... <br><br>Randa couldn&#39;t keep the grin off her face. &quot;So, what have we learned here about proof reading?&quot;<br><br>Rina stuck her tongue out.</i><br><br>Unless the Stinksap is something that a Harry Potter fan should know about, I&#39;m guessing that it&#39;s the result of a spelling error in the Words. Please tell me what the context is.<br><br>Either way, not too shabby a mission.</p>

            <p>It has often been my experience that American authors call the Weasley twins&#39; business &quot;Weasley&#39;s Wizarding Wheezes&quot;. This is not what it&#39;s called, and the reason for that is that the phrase &quot;wizard wheeze&quot; is a slightly archaic term (I think it was used in the Just William books, but don&#39;t quote me on that) for a really good practical joke or prank of some description. Wizard Wheezes is the perfect name for the business, not least because it&#39;s something people have half a chance of getting in Diagon Alley and so forth.

            <p>It&#39;s pretty awesome, and it shows a good deal of courage to go through an old shame and have to read it critically, usually with a stiff drink and a therapist nearby.<br><br>One thing that struck me was that the D.O.R.K.S unit disguised itself as a copy of <i>Magical Me</i>, which seemed odd considering this is set in the Marauder era and the book wasn&#39;t published until the autumn of 1992. But then I realised; that&#39;s exactly the kind of totally minor deviation from canon that wouldn&#39;t upset the Words at all <i>but a PPC agent would definitely notice</i>. Good job. =] </p>

            <p>Rina&#39;s pain is so palpable I can&#39;t stop cringing. It makes for a unique mission, though, particularly the acknowledgments of when you did learn from your mistakes (and when you tried without understanding what actually made a Sue).
