            <p>I have three missions and an interlude that I need to request betas for. All of the missions are Sherlock Holmes. The thing I need the most help with is grammar, but any comments on content are also welcome. I put the HTML tags into the Google Docs, so those are in there. If anyone is willing to take any of these, please let me know. Thank you. <br><br>1.

I&#39;m almost done.<br><br>2. I have a friend who has worked on a compilation of stories for two years, and wants to get them published.

            <p>From what (little) I know, I&#39;d say Elemarth is bang on the money. It helps to go the small-press route; plenty of independent publishers put out anthologies all the time, and they&#39;re always looking for contributors. A few publication credits in small journals will help build up her cred a little, and make an agent more likely to look at her query letter. Best to make sure they don&#39;t get exclusive printing rights for X years, though, and make sure she retains the right to anthologize them. <br><br>And for the love of God, tell her to avoid vanity publishers. Self-publishing is one thing, if she wants to just have a few printed for her friends and family, but outfits like PublishAmerica are absolute poison.</p>

            <p>I don&#39;t think she&#39;ll be able to publish an anthology her first time.  But short stories are easier to publish than novels.  She should look around to see who is trying to create a collection of stories and then which ones she could submit one of her stories to. My guess is that publishing a whole anthology would be like publishing a novel, but in all my searches of agent queries lately, I haven&#39;t seen one query or one bit of advice about this.</p>

            <p>Some people still post them. That is how I found the PPC. Indemaat had stories posted in NCIS, and I followed the links back to the PPC. That series has been on FFnet since the beginning of January. I am guessing that removal of PPC stories is seen to about as promptly as removal of trollfics.</p>

            <p>I have PPC stories dating as far back as february 2006 on FFnet.<br><br>The thing about getting removed is that A) someone has to report you; and B) someone from FFnet has to make time to slough through the pile of abuse reports and act on the report.<br><br>I don&#39;t think the staff of FFnet matches up to the size of the site, and fic with a G rating with MA content takes precedence in getting deleted.

            <p>It&#39;s not a great plan, at any rate. <br><br>As to why they don&#39;t like us, I can&#39;t say for sure, but it&#39;s almost certainly something to do with the sporking.

            <p>A motorcycle gang, what would their name be?<br>It&#39;s a serious question, before you ask.  My two agents are being tossed head-first into a Sons of Anarchy story (great show, but oh my god, the Sueage in the fics). They&#39;re being disguised as a motorcycle club (they might just end up being SOA members...), and I have no idea what the back patch on their jackets/vests would be.<br>Any ideas?<br>Oh--here&#39;s the fic that I&#39;m killing:  <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6146311/1/Youre_the_Only_One"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6146311/1/Youre_the_Only_One">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6146311/1/Youre_the_Only_One</a></a><br>(Author&#39;s summary) Aurora Scrymgeour is the first and only female member of the Sons of Anarchy. She became president after her father&#39;s sudden death, and has to deal with the criticism and advances of the other presidents and members. Can she handle it all?<br>(My comments) Kill the dirty name thief! And:  No female full-patch members. Period. Outlaw motorcycle clubs don&#39;t accept women as full patch members. EV-AR. Well, Hell&#39;s Angels have (had) at least one, maybe three, full-patch member who were women (but that was in the 50s, no further reports after that, so...).<br>-Honu_Wahine</p>

            <p>I remember venturing into that fandom. And then backing out at high speed. Jesus, how many lost sisters/lovers of Jax does SAMCRO need?<br><br>I would be tempted to vote for Clan of the Cactus too, but I&#39;m not sure that would fly in SAMCRO land. So my money&#39;s on a Pratchett reference--the Silver Horde. There&#39;s already a real MC called the Mongols, and that&#39;s not so far off.<br><br>At any rate, I do think you could have some fun with the patches. Not just the main colors, but the upper and lower rocker and the other patches that tend to turn up on the colors--like how normal MCs may have the skull patch to show a member who&#39;s killed for the club, the PPC patches could start normal and get increasingly bizarre. Maybe a syringe for surviving FicPsych? XD</p>

            <p>One of the spin-offs was called that, but it has been used more than once to refer to agents in the DMS. So, assuming that&#39;s where your agents work, it seems fitting. Also, seconding what Calista said about flash patch logo as back patch. {= )<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>So, due to how the story I&#39;m currently writing is turning out, and a few things I&#39;ve recently discovered regarding a character I was planning on using as an Agent once I got permission, I&#39;ve got a couple of questions about the PPC.<br><br>1) Are there any rules regarding the recruitment of canons you&#39;ve created? Because, you see, Shadowrun&#39;s canon is kind of odd, and it seems like the character who is my maincharacter in the fanfiction I write has become canon by virtue of having a big enough reputation, which could be problematic, given that I was planning on turning him into an agent.<br><br>2) Do the agents ever get time off to visit home?<br><br>3) Has anyone ever managed to wrangle a paycheck out of the Flowers?<br><br>4) How would one go about putting a flash patch on a panda?<br><br>I&#39;m sure there will be more questions later, I just can&#39;t think of them right now.</p>

<li>Yes sometimes they do. There was one posted in June about an agent that went home for a visit.<br><br>4. An arm band. My agent that wears only a kilt with no shirt uses an armband flash patch. Or a panda could use a collar style necklace flash patch, I suppose.</li>

<li>If we&#39;re talking about the game system, and by &quot;big enough reputation&quot; you mean the game stat that deals with notoriety, it&#39;s no issue. It&#39;s not <i>actually</i> canon unless it gets published in a source book or an officially affiliated novel, comic, etc.; everything that happens in people&#39;s games (or fanfic, by extension) can be considered AU. (Perfectly valid AU, in fact--but still not canon.) So, essentially, you can do what you like provided you have a decent explanation for it.<br><br>On the other hand, if your fanfic is just so popular that you&#39;re worried real people will recognize the character, that&#39;s different, and you&#39;ll have to decide for yourself whether you want to go there or not.<br><br>2. As others have mentioned, it does happen sometimes, but usually the sheer amount of paperwork required is prohibitive. This applies to vacations in general. An agent has to be really bloody persistent, and possibly carrying a flamethrower, to make it happen.<br><br>3. Calista mentioned Vemi and Penny as a particularly clever example. They had the force of canon behind them; my memory is that the others had something to bargain with, too. Not everyone can find bargaining chips of sufficient worth, though.<br><br>4. Doesn&#39;t he have a hat? He could attach it to the hat, maybe by means of a hatband.<br><br>~Neshomeh</li>

            <p>Actually, the character (Nifar Corvus, better known as Surge to the &#39;runner community)has apparently gained enough of a real-world reputation in the Shadowrun gaming community that he&#39;s been referenced once or twice in a few of the books.<br><br>Like I said, the way Shadowrun&#39;s canon works is kind of odd.

<li>Your canon, your decision, right? But if you want to dissociate yourself as the canon&#39;s author from yourself as the author of the PPC missions, you could always have some kind of tech malfunction that duplicated the canon, or recruit him from an alternate universe. One possibility is to recruit him from a badfic where the author has consistently spelled the possessive without an apostrophe, effectively turning a singular into a plural so repeatedly as to duplicate the canon. The extra canon could be recruited (and would probably have a species of &quot;Living Typo&quot;.)Canons have been also been recruited to the PPC post-mortem; Team Phoenix is made up entirely of supposedly-dead canons.<br><br>2. Yes, occasionally, especially if they&#39;re so stressed out that Medical (or FicPsych) says that one more mission will snap them entirely. Other occasions I remember have been honeymoons, graduations, and family illness; and a few agents have taken time off to attend an OFU or a World One university. Younger agents are more likely to get permission to visit home, and often discover that very little time has passed since they left. (OFU time works similarly.)<br><br>3. Yes. One pair of assassins I remember became Discworld assassins (as in, the Assassins&#39; Guild), and hired themselves out to the PPC to do their old jobs. Very clever of them, too, I think.<br><br>4. You could try a jacket like the one worn by service dogs. Google it if you don&#39;t know what I&#39;m talking about; they&#39;re quite rugged and will stay on reliably.</li>

            <p>At first glance:<br><br>On one hand I am instantly leery of all Transdimensional Hopping if only that I know (and have perpetrated) the worst of it. <br><br>On the other hand the absurdity might be acceptable, because a person from an alternate universe sounds pretty old-hat for the cartoon series itself. We&#39;re speaking for a tv show that has a mad scientist lament how he was forced to stand as a Garden Gnome all his childhood and find rivalry in a super-spy platypus. In this same cartoon is displayed frequently acts such as as painting an entire continent, and somehow producing a sizable coastline in one&#39;s backyard-- I don&#39;t know if interdimensional hopping is all too out of place. This might be a rare case where tv show characters somehow ending up in an alternate dimension where they&#39;re... a tv show... might be NORMAL for the universe.<br><br>But, on <i>yet another</i> hand it all comes down to the execution. One thing that makes me instantly skeptical of this fic is that the girl is already obsessed with P and H from the get-go-- that usually never ends well and is codename for Author Surrogate rather than just a passing original character. <br><br>Gonna need more hands to be on.<br><br>I find that this kind of okay-written Transdimensional Hopping or Self Insertion story is very typical of late-stage Suethors who have written a fair bit and realized they might be writing Mary Sues. Usually around 16 or so, possibly 17, they deliberately write a fairly normal, average character in the beginning... but if they can sustain that character remains to be seen.<br><br>I don&#39;t know about this story though-- I need to read it when I&#39;m not at work. If the girl exists solely to have fun random wacky lulzfest hijinks, not to make a story, then she&#39;ll go the way of Mary Sue pretty fast.<br><br>But then again, the show itself is mostly fun wacky lulz pulled off well, so... I don&#39;t really know. :|<br></p>

            <p>I&#39;ve only started on Lovecraft, but I rather like the inescapable OH MY GOD WTF IS THAT brain-breaking horror style.<br><br>...Basically, most horror is about something freaky, okay, yeah, but we can kill it. Vampires, werewolves, zombies, serial killers. Lovecraft horror very different: There are things out there that are much, much, MUCH bigger than we are. They can and will eat our souls for breakfast. Just learning of their existence is enough to drive logical, sane humans to madness and suicide--sometimes en masse. The only thing we can hope for is that these things never wake up, because they&#39;re sure never going to <i>die</i>, and our chances of survival if they ever <i>do</i> come back to take over the world are virtually nil. Anyone who <i>does</i> survive will do so entirely at the whim of these greater powers, who are stronger, older, and more terrifying than we could ever hope to comprehend.<br><br>That&#39;s what I like: it&#39;s not apocalyptic where a few people survive (The move 2012 is a prime example of this), and there&#39;s hope. It&#39;s also not removable-terror horror (Friday the 13th, Saw, every vampire horror novel since time began, etc.) where whatever it is is scary but defeatable. It&#39;s pre-apocalyptic horror with absolutely no hope whatsoever. There is no escape, and there is no hero to save the day; there is no way to hide until the horror ends. If these things come back, <i>we. are. screwed.</i><br><br>Lovecraft is a smack upside the head to the human ego; one that&#39;s badly needed.</p>

            <p>I admit, I&#39;ve... never actually read any of his work first-hand.  I am familiar with a few concepts, a few Great old Ones for example.  But also his description of Cathuria from &quot;the White Ship&quot; (1919)<br><br>But it does present an interesting quandry:  the nature of the Human ego seems to far outstrip it&#39;s relative (non)importance in the greater cosmos... but why?  <br><br>Is it a holdover from a time when it was a certainty that we were made in the image of paternal gods (who, if they do exist, probably spend their days in an asylum being fed the Blue Pills while they sit in the corner and stare at our dust-mote peice of the universe)? Or... in the face of our certain fate if we are on-world when Cthullhu awakens... do we merely decide to run while he still sleeps?  To do what was unimaginable to a 1920s New Englander and flee to a place that might not have a giant, 13th dimensional squid-demon waiting to wake up.  Sure, we may bump into something worse... but it&#39;s (like i said) something that helps.   <br><br>But then again... trying to embrace the emptiness by going out there and doing things seems to beat merely staying put and awaiting destruction to a lot of people.  Graffito-tagging the Universal wall with our little words instead of trying to read the runes of the greater beings.<br><br>I guess that&#39;s what I like:  you&#39;ll never be able to beat these things, you&#39;re barely able to communicate with them without going nuts and, like I layed out, only their wierdoes actually take and interest in us... but it is still  fascianting stuff (until the moment their multi-dimensional forms short out your vision centre, that is).<br><br>Embrace it accept it... and get out of their way.<br><br>I think I&#39;ll stick with the Elder Ones myself: a nice, homegrown pre-cambrian civilization of... things.</p>

Kitty&#39;s a highly intelligent, capable character; but she&#39;s too well-written to be a Mary Sue, and the story balances its focus between her, Nathaniel, and Bartimaeus way too well. If she were a Sue, you&#39;d end up with her taking over the stage; but she doesn&#39;t... considering that she&#39;s balanced against a demon and a magician, she doesn&#39;t outclass the other main characters.

            <p>I feel like I&#39;m overwhelming the board with pointless messages, but I am going to go beyond my feelings of guilt and also my worry that this will be ill-received and share it anyway.<br><br>Background: about a month ago, I was bored, and it occurred to me to look up Klingon-language fanfic. I found some (not much, but at least two stories; no idea if they&#39;re good or not). My thought, of course, was, &quot;There should be non-Star Trek Klingon-language fanfic&quot;. Well, I was really bored this evening, so now there is. It&#39;s only 100 words, a <i>Dark is Rising</i> sequence drabble. I&#39;m inordinately proud of it, although I suspect it&#39;s pretty bad, considering I wrote it by flipping through <i>The Klingon Dictionary</i> (which, in my defense, includes a grammar sketch, and languages are kind of my thing). You can read it <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6214078/1/pImtaH_wIl">here</a>.<br><br>On the off chance anyone knows some Klingon and is bored enough to read it, let me know if you spot any grammar errors.<br><br>If you don&#39;t know any Klingon, I hope the idea has at least amused you briefly, otherwise this post is pretty much useless.<br><br>This is one of those things where I type it all up, debate whether or not to post it, consider that I come off as kind of hyperactive, weigh that against the possibility that someone here actually <i>does</i> know Klingon, and decide to post it anyway.<br><br>I hope I&#39;m not being as obnoxious/annoying as I feel like I am.<br><br>Hope and regards,<br>Lleu</p>

            <p>The idea is ingenious, yes. But if I were searching for The Dark Is Rising fic, and I stumbled across that, I would - not knowing Klingon - be exceedingly annoyed.

            <p>Not knowing that much about how fanfiction.net works, is that really what would/might happen?

            <p>Will happen, most likely. FF.N readers tend to be either hyperactive fanbrats or grumpy vigilanties. And to be honest, though I am a bit <i>Star Trek</i> fan and would find it fun to try and read a fanfic (in a fandom I know, and this isn&#39;t one, sorry) in that language, I would still hesitate upon seeing this. On livejournal or the like, sure, but FF.N is rather fanatic about being stories-only, and to be honest, writing in a language almost no one knows (and in a different fandom, to boot), strikes me more as a fun exercise than a real story. </p>

It&#39;s a Sue.<br><br>2) Remembering some of the discussions we had earlier about the PPC being more than just Sue-slayers, I went ahead and edited <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProtectorsOfThePlotContinuum"> the relevant TvTropes page</a> (and the laconic entry) to reflect the more diverse roles.

            <p>It&#39;s sad when fanwriters do a better job than the actual writer, and certain Twilight fanfics are a good example of this. These selections here I&#39;ve picked mainly for their alternate takes on the series, as well being some good reads.<br><br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4759768/1/The_Meadow_Scene_Redone"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4759768/1/The_Meadow_Scene_Redone">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4759768/1/The_Meadow_Scene_Redone</a></a> - Changes a certain scene from the first book, removing some of the more... dislikes... aspects of the series, while actually giving Bella a <i>personality</i>!<br><br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4516602/1/The_Paper_Doll_Kindergarten"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4516602/1/The_Paper_Doll_Kindergarten">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4516602/1/The_Paper_Doll_Kindergarten</a></a> - a darker, more twisted take on the aftermath of the Twilight Saga, giving a bit of a more disturbing outcome.<br><br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4333491/1/moves_in_mysterious_ways"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4333491/1/moves_in_mysterious_ways">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4333491/1/moves_in_mysterious_ways</a></a> - this one&#39;s a bit of a role reversal... and also counts as a realistic deconstruction in a way.<br><br><a href="http://orange-crushed.livejournal.com/132983.html"><a href="http://orange-crushed.livejournal.com/132983.html">http://orange-crushed.livejournal.com/132983.html</a></a> - Everyone knows Bella is a manipulative bitch, but this story takes this concept and runs with it.<br><br>On a final note, is anyone gonna see the new movie &quot;Vampires Suck&quot;? I <i>know</i> those movies are generally bad, but this one actually looks <i>good</i>. Of course, that&#39;s because I pretty much despise Twilight and other recent vampire stuff... any thoughts? </p>

            <p>It just that most of them don&#39;t involve Bella and Edward, or their love story/triangle.

            <p>...it is time for a good old-fashioned food fight.  Anyone who wishes to join in may do so, no permission is needed.<br><br>And now, I give you the instigating event:<br>----------<br>Agent Barid sat at a table in the middle of the cafeteria.  He was bored.  He was tired of being bored.  He sat across the table from a balding agent he didn&#39;t know.  The man looked run down.  Barid felt that he could help.<br><br>The troll agent looked at his table-mate and said in his Troll accent (read:Jamaican), &quot;Someone should do somet&#39;in about da Flowers.  Dey run us ragged and dere ain&#39;t no one saying nuttin&#39;.  It&#39;s time ta take a stand.&quot;<br><br>The man looked at Barid.  He spoke with a slight Scottish accent.  &quot;If we stand up tae them, we&#39;ll lose.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Ya,&quot; said Barid, gaining strength as he spoke, &quot;Stand an ya may lose.  Follow dem and ya&#39;ll live.  And when ya console&#39;s beepin, years from now, would ya be willin&#39; ta trade ALL da days,&quot; he climbed onto the table with a bowl in his hand, &quot;from dis day to dat, for one chance, just one chance, ta come back &#39;ere and tell da Flowers dat dey may take our vacations, but dey&#39;ll never take... OUR FOOD FIGHTS!&quot;  <br><br>With that final yell he scooped a blue, pudding-like mass out of the bowl and hurled it at someone sitting at the next table.<br>-----------<br><br>Join in and have fun!<br><br>-Barid</p>

            <p>&quot;What the hell was that?&quot; Agent Silikat sighed, looking across the Cafeteria.

That was <i>just</i> great.<br><br>Nevertheless, she attempted to carry on eating (some sort of cat food.

            <p>&quot;Why is everything in this room <i>blue</i>?!&quot; screeched Kazeyama. The Siu-Riu was splattered with a number of blue foods, and the number of blue-haired or blue-skinned agents around was abnormally large. Of course, it technically meant that the blue-scaled dragon had better camouflage, but that point was lost on her.<br><br>&quot;That I do not know,&quot; answered her aquiline partner. Gwelumir had occupied one of the rafters as soon as the food fight had started, not wishing to get sauces and juice splattered all over her feathers. Kazeyama would have joined her, but after seeing the fate of the other airborne Agent, decided not to risk it.<br><br>The young dragon felt her back splattered with something wet; further inspection revealed it to be cream corn. That was the last straw. Racing to the kitchen section, she found a tub of soup--well, maybe it was soup; it looked rather more like primordial ooze. Mentally apologizing to whatever lifeforms were developing in there, she stuck her head in, gulping massive amounts of the substance. She filled her storage pouches, then sprinted back out, armed and ready for action. Spotting someone with what looked like a rocket launcher that dispelled food instead of rockets, she decided they were good enough for revenge, and regurgitated the soup in a torrent, drenching pretty much everyone nearby.<br><br>&quot;I always thought that particular ability was rather disgusting,&quot; commented Gwelumir. The Great Eagle was still unruffled. &quot;Firebreathing is much more sanitary.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Shut up,&quot; shouted the Japanese dragon to the rafters. &quot;You&#39;re from Lord of the Rings, you&#39;re biased.&quot;</p>

            <p>Miah was confused for a moment as to how the cafeteria had gotten upside down, but then she spluttered and realized that she was upside down against the wall where the torrent of soup like substance had washed her.<br><br>She straightened up and found her cream corn rocket launcher a few feet away. It was bent into uselessness. She cursed violently enough that the blue glop turned pink. It had taken a lot of bribery to get Castor and the minis to make that thing.<br><br>She grabbed the nearest projectiles she could find, which looked a lot like still wriggling worms in red sauce, <i>Who would want to eat <b>that</b></i>? she wondered.

            <p>The Noldo known as Ithalond was not very comfortable on the subject of food. His wife Mithiriel was an excellent cook, but unfortunately, Ithalond had once been traumatized by a Dibbler pie and still had flashbacks whenever too much meat was in the vicinity. It was his bad luck to be in the cafeteria, refilling a coffee pot, when the food fight began.<br><br>He yelped like a startled deer, dropped the coffee pot, dived over the nearest table (knocking over several dishes in the process and sending soup spraying everywhere), hit the deck, tucked and rolled like a master martial artist, and wound up cowering under a random agent&#39;s table with his artificial hands firmly jammed in his own mouth. Ever heard a high, proud, ancient, and wise Elf whimper like a kicked puppy? You have now.</p>

            <p>Agent Miah wiped bits of what might charitably be called vegetables from her face. Luckily the soup had gotten cold before the diving, rolling, now whimpering streak of agent had sent it spraying toward her and Cali&#39;s table. She pulled her dart gun out and peeked under the table.<br><br>A silver haired Lord of the Rings elf was gibbering in fear. She rolled her eyes, even she couldn&#39;t shoot someone that traumatized.

            <p>Thank goodness for out-of-continuity food fights. ^^<br><br>--<br><br>The blue pudding hit Ian on the back of the head, making a particularly fine splatting noise as it came in contact with his dreadlocks. His partner, who had been just about to put a forkful of her Sue-loaf (meatloaf made with leftover Suvian remains)into her mouth, raised an eyebrow at the mess.<br><br>&#39;Are you going to let that troll insult your honor like that?&#39; Lee asked, nodding at Barid. <br><br>Ian grinned brightly, scooped up a large helping of mashed potatoes, and turned in his seat.

            <p>Unfortunately the mashed potatoes missed and hit a rather out of sorts newcomer.

            <p>&quot;Why couldn&#39;t we have gotten some real food on our last mission?&quot; Kelok grumbled.<br><br>&quot;You forgot to bring the money, and I&#39;m tired of getting chased and shot at for stealing it.

He looked around the room of laughing, food-dripping agents, and smiled. He dragged his fingers through his hair, and came up with a handful of spaghetti. He picked up the &quot;meat&quot;loaf, which had split into two pieces--both of which were trying to crawl off his plate, and ran after Unger. Having more ammunition and better cover was definitely the superior tactical position in this fight.<br><br>He launched his food missiles at random as he ran.</p>

            <p>Lee had managed to convince Ian to leave the sanctuary of the table he&#39;d been holed up under, promising to protect him from any future food-related attacks. Given that about ten seconds later Ian was hit by one of Barid&#39;s cream-filled pastries, this &quot;promise&quot; was null and void.

            <p>Barid was forced to take cover as creamed corn splattered against the table e was behind.  He heard the sound of the torrent of soup and had just gotten around to surveying the scene when an olive hit him in the eye.

            <p>To Caleb&#39;s credit, the vampire recovered from his fall rather well and managed to grab the bowl of peas. A handful went into the face of the agent who had thrown Nm&#39;s&amp;Nm&#39;s on the floor. Staring around, he spotted four agents at the condiments counter and launched the rest of the peas in their direction.<br><br>At that moment, Jack made a valiant attempt to rejoin his partner, only to slip on the same brightly-colored candies that Caleb had fallen victim too. Someone threw what looked like half a watermelon, which struck the ground inches from the zombie&#39;s face and splattered him with pulp.<br><br>&quot;Really, Jack?&quot; Caleb sighed.<br><br>&quot;Don&#39;t blame me, I don&#39;t even have eyes or anything!&quot; Jack complained. He licked his lips. &quot;Hm. Tasty. Can I pounce now?&quot;<br><br>The Twi-vamp was about to say no, but rethought this. &quot;Well... fine. But no ripping. Or biting. Or lethal force of any kind.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Okay, Mr. Tight Leash,&quot; the Hunter muttered, before pouncing straight for a small bespectacled boy hiding behind the counter.</p>

            <p>Kyle and Kevin stopped attacking Jack, and stared open mouthed at the sugar that had dropped over most of the cafeteria. They looked at each other, and shouted, &quot;Sugar!&quot; at the same time.<br><br>They scrambled away from the fight, completely oblivious to anything other than the sugar.<br><br>Cali skidded to a stop upon seeing the boys&#39; distraction from the other agent. When he realized what they were after, he groaned. There was no way the Nursery was going to let him drop the boys off until the sugar high <i>and</i> the subsequent crash wore off. <br><br>Hannah looked to Cali for her cue, but upon finding him completely distracted, she looked for cover instead. The sticky rice ball thrower seemed to have ran out of ammunition, and was currently scraping gruel into a pile to restock. She ran toward him--she figured with her supply of Kool-Aid, she had a good bargaining position to join him in using that section of the buffet for cover.</p>

She dropped the hose into the vat, and aimed the device at the dragon that had destroyed her cream corn rocket launcher. <br><br>She pulled the trigger and started spraying a barrage of blue pickled eggs at the dragon, and continuing on around the room.</p>

            <p>Miah aimed at the pancakes flying like frisbees, and tried to hit them before they landed. It was nice target practice. She missed some of them, and a lot of eggs splatted into people in the attempt. When there were no more pancakes, she turned her aim toward the man who had been throwing them, and fired.</p>

            <p>Kazeyama was about to retaliate at the bazooka-wielding Agent when she was overtaken by a liquidy glop that seemed to resemble oatmeal. &quot;Ackpth!&quot; She floundered to the surface, glaring at her aquiline partner, who was laughing. It sounded rather more like a choking duck, in fact, but the intent was clear. The dragon glared. &quot;Shut up!&quot; She scooped up a glop of gruel and hurled it at Gwelumir. It was well-aimed; the large bird didn&#39;t have time to get out of the way before it splatted onto her chest.<br><br>&quot;Oh, you&#39;re going to regret that,&quot; muttered the Eagle.

            <p>This is a wonderful idea. Even if Aster kind of is not yet an agent, she, too, can be comical and dish out a recipie or two.<br><br><b>Aster Corbett&#39;s Ragin&#39; Renagade Salmon Croquettes</b><br><br>Things you need to assemble:<br><br>1) A can of salmon. That&#39;s right. Canned. Not fresh. Canned salmon can be found on World One, but I suppose you can substitute similar canned fish. Just don&#39;t pick something too fatty or weird or full of people it ate. And make sure there are no dolphins or other wildlife harmed in the production of the canned seameat.<br>2)Breadcrumbs. Panko breadcrumbs are best, so go hit someone and take their panko or something. If not, well, I guess you could use something else. But you&#39;re a wimp.<br>3) A small onion. <br>4) Oil for your pan, for pete&#39;s sake.<br>5) One Egg (avian periods courtesy of a World 1 chicken are preferable, but any bird egg of similar size will do)<br>6) Anything you want to flavor the salmon with, optional. (Code for: salt plus whatever is lying around)<br>7) Appropriate utensils. Frying pan, spatula, cutting board, can opener, knife, chopping bowl. Etc.<br><br>Directions:<br><br>1) Open can of salmon. Inside should be an articulated chunk of salmon, already cooked. Yes, that&#39;s right-- it&#39;s pre-cooked with the head and fins cut off. But not de-boned. Empty the can, with ALL of the juice, into your cutting bowl. I use a wooden bowl that looks silly as a hat. Go through the salmon with a fork and pick out all of the biggest bones: the vertebra, the big ribs. There will always be little stringy things in the meat. That is just how salmon works and they vanish when chopped. Also, there might be a skin with scales. It&#39;s not important to eliminate all of the skin (actually, it has tasty fat in it) but if this is the case, DO get rid of the scales. They&#39;ll be small and transluscent.<br><br>2) The small onion should be peeled and chopped, geez. Little shreds the size of what you get when you punch holes in paper with a hole punch, maybe a little shredder. Maybe like, what you get when you feed a Mary Sue into a jet intake...<br><br>3) Mix the chopped onions with the dissected canned salmon. Then, crack the egg into the bowl-- this will help your little nuggets stick together. Finally, add some breadcrumbs to help hold the egg and the delicious salmon juice, but not too much. Then, I use a nifty <a href="http://www.knives.net/ULU-REG1.jpg">ulu knife</a> I stole from an eskimo to chop everything together in the bowl until it&#39;s mixed. I guess you can take two normal knives and cross-chop them that way, too. If you haven&#39;t mugged an eskimo lately.<br><br>4) Add whatever you want to flavor the little fish nuggets with now. I usually just add some salt, but if you have any leftover herbs or seasonings you like on salmon, feel free to mix them in. <br><br>5) You should already have your frying pan hot and oiled. Dummy.<br><br>6) Time to get dirty. Use your (CLEAN!) hands to take scoops of fish a little smaller than a (non &#39;80s) cell-phone and press and roll your fish goop into little oblong nuggets-- they should be a bit smaller than an egg each. If the fish goop is too sticky or gloppy to hold, mix in more breadcrumbs. Roll these little nuggets in yet more breadcrumbs and then toss them as you finish forming them into your sizzlin&#39; frying pan.<br><br>7) Multitask! You agent types should be good at that! Keep making your little nuggets and shuffle the ones around in the pan with a fork or something to make sure they get all crisp and delicious golden-brown on all sides. Keep an eye on them. When one is done, put it on a plate covered with paper towel to sit. Eventually, all of them will be cooked and there will be no more fish glop to make into nuggets.<br><br>8) Eat them! You can serve them as a side for spaghetti instead of italian sausages or something if you want I guess. Just eat some salad or vegtables too-- as quick and easy as these are... they&#39;re still fried! You fatso!</p>

            <p>The original recipe calls for World 1 watershrimp, but other small crustaceans can be easily substituted. <br><br><b>Agent Riddick&#39;s Shrimp Sauce</b><br><br>1 lb fresh watershrimp<br>1/4 lb butter<br>1 tsp flour<br>1 glass water<br>Splash of milk<br>Pepper and salt (to taste)<br><br>1.

When everything is dissolved, add milk. Imagine you&#39;re back in the Weyr and enjoy.<br><br>If you prefer, you can substitute the milk for soy milk, rice milk, etc., or skip it entirely. You can also spike it with your favorite alcoholic beverage for a little extra kick on really tough days.</p>

            <p>This is a very simple recipe which can be made out of stuff off the shelf--exactly the kind of thing this agent would be able to do. XD<br><br>Agent Suicide&#39;s Lemon-Pepper Chicken<br><br>App. 1 1/4 pounds frozen boneless chicken (four thick breast pieces)<br>1 bottle randomly-chosen lemon-pepper marinade (or if you wanna get fancy, use the recipe at <a href="http://southernfood.about.com/od/bbqsaucemarinade/r/blbb288.htm"><a href="http://southernfood.about.com/od/bbqsaucemarinade/r/blbb288.htm">http://southernfood.about.com/od/bbqsaucemarinade/r/blbb288.htm</a></a> .)<br>Few tablespoons olive oil (to taste)<br><br><br>1. Thaw the chicken. Set it, still wrapped in plastic, in a bowl of cold water for about the length of one standard Spartan shield drill. (That&#39;s three to six hours for you civilians.)<br>2. Slice each chicken breast in half lengthwise, creating thinner fillets. Agent Suicide recommends using a small machete or a WW2-era trench knife, but any good chef&#39;s knife will do if you really must.<br>3. Put the fillets in a bowl and cover with the marinade. Leave to set in the fridge overnight, preferably under guard to prevent delicious chicken theft. (Spartan gentleman-rankers or devoted squires only for the guard. Achaean and Thessalonian mercenaries are too prone to leftovers theft.)<br>4. Relieve the guards from their posts and remove the bowl from the refrigerator. <br>5. Prepare a skillet by greasing it with a few spoonfuls of olive oil. Any skillet may be used, but Agent Suicide is a firm believer in good old-fashioned, just-like-grandma-used-to-break-heads cast iron. <br>6. Be careful not to heat the skillet too quickly, or your chicken will start spitting fat and smoke all over the place. Suicide recommends a good &quot;medium&quot; heat and a little Scotch to liven up your next half-hour of standing at the stove.<br>7. Place two or three fillets in the pan, turning with a fork when they begin to brown. Slicing them down the middle is also helpful to make sure the chicken cooks thoroughly. Do <i>not</i> pour any of the used marinade into the pan, unless you like cleaning little bits of sticky brown crust out of <i>everything.</i> (If you do, Agent Suicide is not judging you. After living with Spartans, nothing surprises him.)<br>8. Cook until well-done, or however you like it. <br>9. Caution! Pan will be extremely hot, greasy, and possibly smoky when you finish it. Residual grease may be poured down the throat of any captured Sues--or, if you&#39;re boring, you can pour it into a tin can and put it in the freezer. (This makes it much easier to collect and dispose of a great deal of residual grease, but has no added advantage of shrieking and flailing.)<br>10. Enjoy your chicken.<br>11. Glare at the console, which goes off approximately 30 seconds into step 10.<br>12. Promise yourself you&#39;ll get another job tomorrow.</p>

            <p>Hello everyone! *waves* It&#39;s nice to meet you!<br><br>I lurked around this board some years back, did a few MSTs, and wandered away for a while. After getting distracted by shiny things and school related things, and sometimes even shiny school related things, I slogged my way back out of the depths of the internets.<br><br>Fandom-wise, I quite adore Dr. Who (both new and old series), Alice in Wonderland 2010, Discworld, Good Omens, Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, and far too many series of anime for my own good or productivity.<br><br>I think that&#39;s pretty much it, I&#39;m looking forward to getting back into the swing of things!<br></p>

However, it will cause her to overdose on Logicillin, and nobody wants to know what happens to a knurd agent in PPC HQ.<br>- (Besides, it&#39;s 27, mostly various shades of purple.)</li>

<li>I will not spike Agent Kelok&#39;s Nigel pill bottle with triple strength pills. While it may be amusing to watch a Wraith hallucinate an army of highly improbable attack turtles, he is quite good at defending himself, and it&#39;s no fun getting caught in the cross fire.<br><br>1102. I will not attempt to find out what Agent Unger wears under his kilt.<br><br>1103. Even though Agent Cali has bright blue hair and cool shades, he is <i>not</i> a Sue, and henceforth should <i>not</i> be shot on sight.<br><br>1104. I will not steal Agent Miah&#39;s anti-lustin inhaler and send her to a glitterfic. Even if I could sell tickets, it isn&#39;t worth the risk of her deciding to chase me through the halls of HQ, thinking I am her LO, instead of her targeting Agent Cali. <br><br>1105. I will not attempt to convince DoSAT agents that a winged kitten was the one to tamper with my console. If I do make such an attempt, I will not complain about whatever the disguise generator generates on my next mission.<br><br>1106. I will not make messes in front of Agent Cali, just to see how long he can resist cleaning them. If I do, I will arrange the betting pool ahead of time. If he knows about it, it will skew my results.<br><br>1107. I will not feed Castor, the mad scientist in winged kitten form, too many pumpkin guts. If I do, I will not blame the resulting drunken mad science on Agents Miah and Cali. Agent Miah likes to shoot people with her dart gun, and act out the lyrics of the &quot;What do you do with a Drunken Sailor&quot; song, and having your belly shaved with a rusty razor is not pleasant.<br><br>1108. I will not put the latest movie versions of Tony Stark, Sherlock Holmes, and Charlie Chaplin in a room to &quot;see what happens&quot;.<br></li>

            <p>Emerging briefly from lurkerville to report this recent Redwall fic:<br><br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6173485/1/Trouble_in_Noonvale">Trouble in Noonvale</a><br>Redwall - Rated: T - English - Crime/Romance - Chapters: 2 - Words: 1,171 - Reviews: 1 - Updated: 7-29-10 - Published: 7-24-10<br><br>The basic plot point is that a rat comes out of nowhere, rapes Aryah (you know...Latrose&#39;s <i>mother?</i>) and then disappears just as quickly as he came.<br><br>And where was Urran Voh, her loving and devoted husband while this was happening?  Why, he was out on a walk with a Dusky-Footed Woodrat (original capitalization preserved) named Neotoma (which sounds like the kind of name you&#39;d give a cancerous growth that resembles the main character of The Matrix).  She has also come out of nowhere, and, without any of the usual questions on exactly <i>why</i> a maiden from a vermin species is in Noonvale, she manages to get the valley&#39;s entire population to &quot;party&quot; over her arrival.<br><br>So, beatdown of entire story so far...strange-looking ratess comes out of nowhere, and right on her pretty little heels comes the to-be rapist.  Rapist sees Aryah, is inexplicably filled with lust, and then runs off before Noonvale can get a good look at him.  Ratess dismisses him as <i>&quot;Uhhhhhhh...okkkkeeeeyyyy...that was weeeeeiiiiiiirrrrrrrrddd...&quot;</i> and starts party.  Later, ratess lures Voh away from his house for a &quot;walk,&quot; in which time rapist preys on Aryah.  Vermin conspiracy, or horrendously written Suefic?  You decide, I&#39;m too high on Bleeprin to comment.<br><br>On a more serious note, the author seems to be a young girl whose other stories, while not being anywhere near works of art, seem to be fairly innocuous.  She&#39;s also literate; you&#39;ll find that her grammar is mostly correct, if her style is a bit awkward.  I&#39;m going to try reviewing this story to ask about this apparent fluke.<br><br>In the meantime, it&#39;s probably a story that should be allowed to age a little.  All of the events I recorded happened in just the first two chapters.<br><br>Hopefully I might be able to post an actual mission here soon... </p>

            <p>Maybe I was a bit too harsh on her name.  I used to do the same thing myself, pick an exotic animal and use the genus name.<br><br>But what does make a bleepfic?  I used the term to indicate that it was somewhat less than a really bad fic...I guess I was wrong.  Ah, the joys of lurking.  Drat.</p>
