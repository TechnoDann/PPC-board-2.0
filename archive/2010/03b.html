            <p>So, just for fun, I thought I&#39;d try a MST. I chose a bad!fic that takes two things I like quite a bit and mixes them together, with just a dash of a fandom I am fairly ambivalent about. This is my first MST, so I would love to know what I&#39;m doing wrong (or right!)  <br><br><a href="http://terrofen.livejournal.com/"><a href="http://terrofen.livejournal.com/">http://terrofen.livejournal.com/</a></a><br><br>It is the only entry thus far.</p>

            <p>AS I SEEEEP INTO THE BLAAACKEST VOID OF AAAALL- Oh, sorry about that. I like that song a bit too much, that&#39;s all...<br><br><br>I, MAXinsanity, request permission to join the Protectors of the Plot Continuum. I swear that I will try to uphold canon, terminate badfic, and to utterly and completely despise the creatures known as Mary-Sues that infest the myraid worlds. I will try my best not just to write, but to prevent myself from being consumed by the drama monster inside. I request that I keep my sanity, or actually, what little is left of it right now. Losing any more of it would make me crazier than my agents. I don&#39;t really have any self-insert agents, so I swear that they&#39;ll do their best, otherwise they&#39;ll have a not so friendly meeting with me about it... D:<br>And yes, I&#39;ll try to keep the serious down. I can&#39;t guarantee that I can hold it back forever, though...<br><br>- MAXinsanity<br>____________________________________________________________________<strong><em><br><br>MY AGENTS:<br><br>Falras<br><br>Age: 14 biologically, otherwise unknown<br>Species: Mimiga<br>Gender: Male<br>Partner(s): Alice Alexandria, Doctor Stephan Grall<br>Home Continuum: Cave Story<br>Department: Floaters<br>Fandom(s): Whatever is needed for the mission<br>Weapon Of Choice: AWP sniper rifle from Counter-Strike<br>Lust Object(s): None.<br><br>Appearence: Short, with messy white fur covering entire body. Two somewhat long floppy ears, one on each side of head. These are quite tattered, as is his PPC uniform. Dark green eyes. General posture is quite poor, constantly being exhausted from missions.<br><br>Personality: Falras is a bit of an enigma. Having suddenly appeared in response center 206 as if he was an agent his entire life, his past is a complete mystery. Unusually sane and calm, Falras is obsessed with work at the PPC, and is capable of navigating HQ quite well. Despite his apparently very high amount of experience, he thinks of himself as superior to most agents, sometimes leaving his partner or partners behind, thinking that they&#39;ll only get in the way. Also of note is his extremely serious and stubborn demeanor, not willing to accept failure in any way, or even pulling out of a mission when it&#39;s too tough. Falras is also extremely antisocial, only talking with Flowers or his partners (Mostly to whine about how they suck so much).<br></em></strong>_________________________________________________________________<strong><em><br><br>Doctor Stephan Grall <br><br>Age: 29<br>Species: Human... Mostly.<br>Gender: Male<br>Partner(s): Alice Alexandria, Falras<br>Home Continuum: (REDACTED)<br>Department: Floaters<br>Fandom(s): NiGHTS, Team Fortress 2, Pokemon, and several others.<br>Weapon Of Choice: Knives, pistols.<br>Lust Object(s): &quot;Alice&quot;, and about a hundred others, all non-humans<br><br>Appearance: Mostly normal human, save the unusually angular features. Blue eyes, and wears ugly glasses. Posture is quite twitchy and erratic. PPC uniform is rather normal, but is usually concealed under a white labcoat.<br><br>Personality: Grall is highly unstable mentally, being from a parasitic continuum which apparently is filled to the brim with Sues from what intelligence there gathers. Frequently talking to himself or occasionally bursting into song, Grall has strangely fast reflexes, is extremely intelligent, and is also quite friendly and quick to learn. However, Grall can also be extremely irritating to female non-human agents, frequently flirting with them or generally getting on their nerves. This has lead to at least three incidents leading to Grall being physically injured by them, not counting the countless times that Alice has injured him.<br></em></strong>_________________________________________________________________<strong><em><br><br>Alice Alexandria<br><br>Age: 19<br>Species: Breloom-(REDACTED) Hybrid<br>Gender: Female<br>Partner(s): Doctor Stephan Grall, Falras<br>Home Continuum: Pokemon<br>Department: Floaters<br>Fandom(s): NiGHTS, Team Fortress 2, Pokemon, and several others.<br>Weapon Of Choice: Hammers<br>Lust Object(s): None, as of yet.<br><br>Appearance: Mostly green skin, except for head and neck, which is tan, along with a &quot;Frill&quot; below the neck. Mushroom-like cap on top of head with two small red sphere shaped protrusions on sides. Hands have only three fingers, with claws colored the same as the protrusions on top of her head. Feet are the same as an ordinary Breloom. PPC uniform is tidy and clean.<br><br>Personality: Quite quick to adapt to not acting like an animal, Alice seems rather sane for the most part, only lapsing into aggression when irritated by Grall. The most emotional of the three, and due to the unusual conditions she was recruited in, she displays hatred of the PPC, despite being part of it. Still somewhat paranoid about the entire concept, Alice does not use disguises for the most part, being somewhat afraid of some of the technology at her disposal. Among other problems with her career as an agent, she lacks the drive to kill sues.<br><br>ANNENDUM: Keep in mind that if not injected with the batch of chemicals created by Doctor Grall daily, she will begin to become more and more psychotic and aggressive until she goes into a coma.<br><br></em></strong>________________________________________________________<em><br><br>And now, for my writing sample!

            <p>Just wanted to say that generally Permission turnings-down-of are not permanent &quot;YOU SUCK FOREVERRRR&quot; labels, just &quot;Please try again later&quot; notes. So, if you, by any chance, want a beta, just wanted to drop in. I don&#39;t think I know any of the canons you work in, but as per grammar, spelling, syntax, flow, PPC canon... the concerns listed below and so on, I&#39;m generally pretty good at editing and whatnot. So if you want someone to bounce ideas off of or pointers or whatever, go ahead and e-mail me (Vixenmage AT gmail DOT com). I&#39;ve been kinda looking for something writer-y to do until my muse stops sulking, so I&#39;d greatly appreciate the excuse to muck around in prosaic writings.</p>

            <p>In addition to the issues I outlined earlier, there are some others.<br><br>Your writing in general leaves a bit to be desired on the technical front; tense-shifts, incorrect capitalisations, bewildering ways of describing other characters for a start.<br><br>The bits of badfic you use are few and far between. When you do quote it, you quote vast tracts of it so it&#39;s hard to see what exactly you&#39;re complaining about.<br><br>Your formatting in general I found hard on the eye, with enormous sentences and paragraphs.<br><br>The way your Agents have been recruited is just ... wrong ... for the PPC. <br><br>I stopped even caring about the fic you were sporking because of the errors in your own writing and the distasteful nature of your Agents. This, I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll agree, is slightly contrary to the point of what we do here.<br><br>Another point is that with all your mysteries and [REDACTED]s, which as aforementioned are Not How We Do Things, it makes me leery that one of these days you&#39;re going to up and mess with something even more fundamental. If you can&#39;t operate within the confines of this shared universe as it is, if you have to twist it to feel comfortable writing in it, perhaps this is not the place for you to stretch your creative wings, as it were.<br><br>The main problem is that you appear to have missed the point. You&#39;ve taken our happy, silly, fun setting and darkened it, with your press-ganging and depression. There&#39;s no comedy in this mission. I felt uncomfortable reading it, I didn&#39;t feel that giggling righteousness at the end that normally I would expect to find at the end of a PPC mission. I didn&#39;t feel that it was a job well done.<br><br>This is supposed to be FUN. This is supposed to be stupid, and comical. This is supposed to be slapstick. Your writing sample is none of those. It made me sad.<br><br>I&#39;m sorry, but you don&#39;t seem to have understood the spirit of what we do here, and with that in mind I&#39;m going to say it&#39;s Permission denied. <br><br>- Trojie</p>

            <p>Um, some points.<br><br>Spelling! Please make sure you get someone to look over your spelling (or at least use a spellcheck - &#39;appearence&#39; is something a spellcheck would pick up immediately) before you post any writing. Given we do horrible things to people who make spelling mistakes, we really shouldn&#39;t be making any ourselves.<br><br>Warnings! As July pointed out, you need to do this. Lots of PPC Boarders read missions at work, school, or other places where they may have people peering over their shoulders. Therefore using words like &#39;rape&#39; tends to be a bad idea.<br><br>Was Alice press-ganged into the PPC? Recruits are usually volunteers or persuaded in a friendly manner. We don&#39;t force people to be in the PPC, and the only things we do scientific experiments on are Mary Sues. I&#39;m not sure what the other PGs will think but I personally am uncomfortable with Alice&#39;s backstory in the PPC as I think it creates an unpleasant precedent. <br><br>Where&#39;s &#39;Research&#39;? Do you mean Medical, FicPsych, DMSEAR? <br><br>There&#39;s an awful lot of &#39;classified&#39; and &#39;mystery&#39; stuff in their backgrounds. It&#39;s okay to just not specify if you&#39;re not sure where their stories are going to go in the future, but to deliberately set it up as &#39;classified&#39;? Normally the Marquis and Personnel in general seem happy as Larry to give out even the mst personal of Agent&#39;s information.<br><br>I&#39;m going to reserve judgement for now, and finish reading it later. Given past form I&#39;m sure Neshomeh will be along soon :)<br><br>-Trojie<br><br><br><br></p>

            <p>Note: I am no one of import; I simply felt like making an effort to interact and such. Ordinarily I&#39;d stay out entirely, but my curiosity has demanded that I make an attempt to obtain answers about some things I noticed. You&#39;re in no way obliged to listen to me on this matter, but I would appreciate a thought or two in return.<br><br>I am certainly intrigued by your choice of first-person and present tense. It&#39;s a marked departure from the norm and could certainly bring up many interesting things as time goes on -- though, it may present difficulties as well, given some of the things &#39;fics do. (Also given that most &#39;fics tend to be in past tense, and I&#39;ve observed that Agents tend to match the tense of the &#39;fic, hence tense wrenches and shutting up on that topic now.)<br>I will say that your Agents give me a bit of a turn, in places. <br>On the subject of Falras. The springing full-formed from HQ is odd to my eyes. Most Agents do suddenly appear, true, but most appear from somewhere. And, it strikes me as strange for someone so calm and sane to suddenly start screaming because the mission has taken an unexpected turn. Calmness isn&#39;t exactly an oddity in the PPC, though I do find sanity rare and easily lost... well, I don&#39;t know if I have room to speak on that matter. Hm, the point I&#39;m trying to make is there&#39;s nothing wrong with a calm Agent; in fact, they can be highly entertaining to watch. But, a calm Agent should generally be calm, one thinks, and a sane Agent is likely to lose that precious commodity as time progresses. <br>Grall is interesting, and I mean this in the good way, not the carefully-neutral-I-don&#39;t-know-what-to-say way. I can see much humor coming from his presence and antics. I should like to know where he&#39;s from, though; there seems no sense in the redaction, and I can&#39;t bring anything to mind that&#39;s &#39;parasitic&#39;. Is it a tabletop or RP continuum, or am I barking up the wrong tree entirely?<br>On the subject of Alice. I agree with a lot of what July said here. If it&#39;s just the killing she hates, as your sample suggests to me, why not work in Bad Slash, or one of the internal departments like Medical or DoSAT, or something that doesn&#39;t involve killing? I get that she needs Grall around, but there are ways around that, and the Flowers don&#39;t set out to make people miserable. Er, generally. There&#39;s a line between disapproval/unhappiness/whygodwhy and serious out-and-out hatred, and one thinks that someone on the hatred side would not be put to work in such a manner. An Agent who hates his or her job is likely going to go flamethrower-crazy a lot faster than others, so it&#39;s a bit of self-preservation. (Also, nitpicky crow would like to point out: Addendum.)<br>The Pokémon hybrid thing is a choice I do like, though. <br>And, on the subject of the writing sample... well. I don&#39;t like to bother people about style -- who knows better than you what you&#39;re trying to communicate, after all? -- but there are technical things that keep tripping me up. I&#39;ll acknowledge that I&#39;m unusually picky about grammar and punctuation, but... well. A beta reader is a good plan for everyone, no matter how experienced they are.<br>I&#39;m done being a picky little crow. Going further will make one no friends -- in fact, I have probably grievously offended at least three people already, but I felt the need to speak. <br><br>Make no mistake, I do think that this trio has definite potential for excellent fun and good times. But, I, too, am of the opinion that they could be better. I think it would be a good plan to get a second pair of eyes on, preferably someone who can and will tell you exactly what they think without fear of offending or worse. <br>Best of luck, Max!</p>

            <p>Okay. So. (Latidoremefa.)<br><br>Let&#39;s see here, not a PG, just gonna point some stuff out anyhow though that I would like the PGs to read before they say yay or nay.<br><br>First off, Max, you&#39;ve got Mysterious!surprisefromnowhere!Agent. Very mysterious, very mysterious. And special. <br><br>And why is he wearing a tattered uniform? I know we&#39;re usually running in the red but last I checked we&#39;re generally willing to keep people from accidentally exploding into nudity in the corridors if they pop the wrong seam and the rest of their uniform falls apart.<br><br><br> *stares at Falras disconcertingly* He is seriousness! And not crazy? And &#39;unusally sane&#39;? Are you sure he&#39;s sane? Most agents in the PPC are not  quite sane and saying that he is &#39;unusally sane&#39; implies he has a future breakdown or nine headed his way because one does not cope in the PPC by being just sane. Does not work that way, no siree. You&#39;ve got to either be a bit nuts or a bit not with the reason brain processing or able to accept every single thing that happens to cope. Otherwise your brain shuts down at things like tree days filled with chlorophyll and bear hands and urple because these are from the strange territory beyond reality where things happen with less than logic and not quite so common sense.<br><br><br>Though I can see how that can lead to Hilarity and the Powers That Be going and smacking him with the Ironic Overpower each and every chance had.<br><br>*stares at Grall now*<br><br>Okay, so you have this mostly humanthingumfishnot dude. What&#39;s with the (REDACTED)? SCP people we are not. The parasitic continuum? How does tihs make sense? If it is a continuum then whtever is there is canon and while might be Sues elsewhere if it&#39;s all the same in there it can&#39;t be Sues because it is on par with what is there. Does that make sense at all? The pervertedness is interesting as a character quirk, that could be fun to watch, since hammerspace is occasionaly accessable.<br><br>*stares at Alice*<br><br>Okay, so more (REDACTED). This is no place to hide secrets suchly, it does not amuse or make for sense. You can just tiptoe around it and say BRELOOM HYBRID and avoid what else. The fact that she&#39;s part Pokemon is interesting though. Aso, again, PPC is generally not THIS IS A SECRET AND IT IS CLASSIFIED for everything, especially where involves agents and their bodyparts and species and all that. Fairly open type workplace.<br><br><br>Personality makes no sense. Why would she be part of the PPC if she hates it, and if she hates it so why is she being kept as part of it? And disguises are disguises and help on missions where it is required, so that is quite odd. The Flowers might force the agents to do a lot of AUGH stuff, but they don&#39;t force people to do the job if they  seriously dont&#39;t want it. Most people generally accept the terrible missions as part of doing something to help the canon or for own personal reasons that involve <br><br>Okay, moving on to the writing thingy.<br><br><br>Wah wah wah. D: Despair and angst and things that are reasonable for your character.<br><br>But some things.<br><br>1) Does not quite mess with what is at least my view of the spirit of the PPC.<br>2) I do not quite appreciate looking at my screen and seeing &quot;Rapeface&quot; on it unexpectedly without warning especially since I&#39;m typing this right now and trying to avoid my parents or younger siblings seeing it and going &quot;omgwtf?&quot;. Warnings is good. Warnings is nice. Please use warnings for that sort of langauge because not everyone appreciates it.<br>4) There is no 3.<br>5) There are better ways to express shouting and yelling and general emphasis besides caps.<br>6) This is quite angstydark for a community whose pieces generally trend towards the light and moderatly hilarious cracky and happy.<br>7) Show, do not tell. If this is their first mission and they haven&#39;t known each other very long (I am assuming though I can&#39;t tell for sure the length of time meant to be implied) she wouldn&#39;t know that he is usually calm in the perhaps-I-have-overdosed-on-sedatives-but-am-still-awake way usually even on missions. <br><br>I&#39;ve written too much because I&#39;m rambling and wrapping lines around and around (yay WYSIWYG!) so I&#39;ll leave off for now so presumably someone else can go and tell me I was being too nitpicky.<br><br>Again, not a Permission Giver.<br></p>

            <p>I return! (Okay, so I only vanished for the hellmonth known as February, but who cares? I&#39;m back now!) And, not only do I return, but I return with a question.<br><br>I&#39;m thinking about probably writing at least one fanfic story for a computer game I play a lot. (I&#39;m a nerd. I enjoy being a nerd. And yes, I write fanfic for computer games.) This isn&#39;t so much because I adore the game too much to live without it as that the present standard of writing on that site is... well, I believe atrocious might be putting a touch mildly. In all the corners of the internet I&#39;ve visited, this place may be one of the worst in terms of abuse to the English language. So I want to at least submit something decent, if only to have one thing up there that I can bear to read. <br><br>Now, this game, like many games, has a system of leveling up based on accumulated experience points. You start at level one and end the game at level fifty. Your level determines the spells you can cast, the enemies you fight, etc. A lot of people who write stories based on this use the level terminology. &quot;I was a level twenty-seven and not in Marleybone yet, even though my best friend Sabrina FireWeave was a level twenty-four and already there,&quot; for instance. I find this obnoxious and it throws me brutally out of the story. On the other hand, it&#39;s a part of the game, not something imported by the badfic writers.<br><br>How would you deal with this? Should I just use it, or can anyone think of a better alternative?<br><br>--anamia</p>

            <p>How involved is the story in Wizards 101?  If the story almost seems separate from the mechanics of the game itself, you may just decide to ignore them completely. <br><br>I have more experience with World of Warcraft as the only non-flash MMO i&#39;ve ever played - while I&#39;m sure alot of people like making sillier stories that reference levels and spending gold for spells, the better stories are the ones that ignore that aspect completely and focus on the characters of the Warcraft lore, which is backed up by 3 games prior to the MMO.<br><br>If you&#39;ve ever read any novels based on Dungeons and Dragons, you can see similar things happening - DnD is a very rules-based game, but the novels make no mention of levels, make references to classes only when there are extremely obvious archetypes associated with them (I cannot recall any Salvador novels actually labeling someone as a Rogue).  </p>

            <p>Dann already brought up the example of City of Heroes, where Security Levels (and the villainous equivalent, Threat Levels) are stamped on an ID card every character carries around and must display to get into certain areas -- it&#39;d nearly impossible for anyone in that setting to <i>not</i> use the terminology.  In sufficiently &#39;meta&#39; games, such as S4 League, it&#39;d make sense for everything visible to the players to be visible, since the characters are canonically just avatars for their players.  In comedy, I think you can have characters randomly reference levels and other &quot;universe rules&quot; without it being a problem: the Order of the Stick and its various heirs, many World of Warcraft comedies, and some other series do this on occasion.<br><br>On the other hand, it&#39;s very easy to accidentally end up with narmy &quot;It&#39;s over 9000!&quot; sorta things.  The class schedule or how long someone&#39;s been there may be a lot smoother to write, especially since you can go to relative values rather than end up with painful-to-write level numbers.  Another option would be something similar to the &quot;years&quot; comparisons from <i>Harry Potter</i>; someone five ten levels above you would be from a higher year, someone five or ten levels under from a younger year.  Wizards101 does <s>shameless emulate</s> borrow from <i>Harry Potter</i> enough for the overlap to work.<br><br>Alternatively, you may not want to use that information at all.  Characters don&#39;t know everything, and metagame is often something that&#39;s very easy for them to not know.  It removes the easy method of simply telling information about power, but there are a lot of other ways to establish strength -- everything from method of dress to weaponry to powers to movement tells a lot in most MMOs.  Lots of opportunity to show, rather than tell.</p>

            <p>As Techno-Dann correctly Googled, it is indeed Wizard101. Sorry for not mentioning that earlier. I think I need to go reclaim my brain; it seems to have wandered off somewhere and begun a game of hide-and-seek without telling me.<br><br>Anyway, I like the idea of the levels being more tied into education. I&#39;m reluctant to use words like &#39;grade&#39; or anything else so recognizable, but they&#39;re supposed to be at school anyway, so that makes sense. (We&#39;re ignoring here the fact that a student wizard, especially one who comes from a distant land that doesn&#39;t know about magic, is in change of saving the world. This game is really frighteningly similar to Harry Potter. Really. But I digress.)<br><br>On a side note, would the PPC deal with this kind of story? Not the subject, but the fact that the people who write them are just plain bad writers. I haven&#39;t been able to get through enough of any one to see if they involve &#39;Sues, but they&#39;re just badly written. Would they be left alone, or is it something a department like the Dept. of Technical Errors might handle?<br><br>Thanks for ideas and replies,<br>--anamia</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve never played Wizard101, so don&#39;t know how open-ended the game world is. I guess the question with PPC-ing a game story is whether there&#39;s enough canon in a game world to be able to quantify a breach of canon. (Although, in the case of a completely out-there story that bears no resemblance to the game at all, that&#39;s probably not a problem.)<br><br>A really open-ended game mechanic like (say) one of the Elder Scrolls games might be hard to enforce unless the story messed with the main quest.<br><br>Clumsy characterisation, poor spelling and grammar, and urple prose would be chargeable in any case.<br><br>Any thoughts from those with more game fanfic experience?<br><br>Elcalion</p>

            <p>Anyways, except for certain types of parodies, it is traditional to not refer directly to game mechanics, unless the game story itself mentions them explicitly in the story and gives a specific explanation for what they are. Keep track of what level the characters are, though, so they don&#39;t have inconsistent power levels.<br><br>You&#39;ll note that pretty much all single player roleplaying games considered to be of high quality never mention level in dialogue. It&#39;s on a level with saying, &quot;The sword does 2d6+1d10fire&quot;. The level is part of the game, but presumably the characters don&#39;t actually know what level anyone is.</p>

            <p>The only 1-to-50 game that I&#39;m familiar with is City of Heroes, where players have a &quot;Security Clearance&quot; that&#39;s effectively their level. There, I think it would make sense, as it&#39;s handled like an in-game number. On the other hand, using Levels in WOW fanfic would be jarring and out-of-place.<br><br>*does some googling*<br><br>I&#39;m not terribly familiar with Wizards 101, but there has to be a better system - could you convert levels into class numbers?

            <p>...do it as something along the lines of &#39;threat levels&#39;. Probably 1 is the equivalent of a small harmless forest mammal and the highest is death in a barrel, and the assigned number is something that a certain item can tell you, or a file, or whatever. Still keeping the sort-of level mechanic, but making it make a bit more sense.<br>I&#39;m not explaining this particularly well... Hm. I don&#39;t know about this game, but in most of the games I play there&#39;s an item or spell that gives you a detailed look at the other person&#39;s stats, and can usually be handwaved to say that it gives you a rough approximation of strength, etc., and then the estimated level of threat.<br>Um.<br>Hopefully there&#39;s something in there you that helps a little.</p>

            <p>Hey there! Nice to meet you!<br><br>I&#39;d avoid using the term levels. Saying stuff like &quot;I was more experienced than so-and-so, but hadn&#39;t explored as much as she had&quot; makes the story flow better than using numbers and levels. It&#39;s better to think as the numbers as there for the players benefit rather than the characters.</p>

            <p>I like to think of it as an age.  If you start adventuring at the age of eighteen then that is level one.  Add one year for every level.  This works because the older you get the more experience you have and the more spells you are likely to have learned.<br><br>It might also work to just not mention the level.  Instead, refer to the characters level of experience.  To use your example, &quot;I was further advanced in my studies than my best friend Sabrina FireWeave, though I had yet to make it to Marleybone and she was already there.&quot;  This allows you to keep the relative power levels without explicitly saying what level the characters are in the game.<br><br>Hope this helps.</p>

            <p>Hey, don&#39;t feel weird about not being that into the whole fan fiction thing. I don&#39;t write it either. But this place is more about being part of fandoms and the elimination of the nastiness that constitutes Sues than about writing fan fiction. <br><br>If you do decide to get into the MST business, which you should, as it is very fun, you should have this bag of punctuation.

            <p>I can distinguish bad writing from good writing fairly easily - that&#39;s the major indicator isn&#39;t it?  And Mary Sues shine like beacons.

We&#39;re all guilty of it at some point, it&#39;s just that some people do it in particularly cracky and lulzy ways.

I struggle to see one of those as an Ent-Sue, so I&#39;m afraid she may not be used as firewood.<br><br>So...how &#39;bout dem bumper stickers? 8 )</p>

            <p>(Before you ask, yes, I do have permission to write for the PPC. If anyone wants to archive this mission on their website, go ahead, since I&#39;m not keeping a copy)<br><br>+++<br><br>&quot;- shall thunder from the deepest pits to the very clouds above! Quail, brief and insignificant mortals, quail and cower before -&quot;<br><br>Cassandra slammed the door behind her. &quot;Honey, I&#39;m home!&quot; she shouted. By the console, Alison rolled her eyes.<br><br>&quot;You&#39;ll give us a bad reputation, Sandra,&quot; she said. &quot;There&#39;s enough rumours about us without you starting more.&quot;<br><br>&quot;It was just a joke, Freckles,&quot; (Cas)Sandra replied. &quot;The only person in earshot was Frederick, and somehow I don&#39;t think he was listening. A bit too busy pronouncing doom upon us all.&quot;<br><br>&quot;He&#39;ll get distracted and lose his train of thought before long,&quot; Alison – or &quot;Freckles&quot; to her friends – said. &quot;Did you get it?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Of course,&quot; Sandra replied, and threw the bar of chocolate across to her partner. Freckles snatched it from the air and tore it open.<br><br>&quot;Come to Alison, you sweet, sugary-<br><br>[BEEEEEP!]<br><br>Freckles launched herself down the length of the console and slapped the red button. &quot;Not fair! Not <b>fair</b> you stupid machine! I hadn&#39;t even taken <b>one bite</b>! I should at least-&quot;<br><br>&quot;I think it might be right for once,&quot; Sandra cut in. &quot;Her mother&#39;s the queen of Mirkwood&#39;s mountains, and she-&quot;<br><br>&quot;Marries Legolas and has lots of sweet elf-loving with the incredible hotness that is the Prince of Mirkwood?&quot; Freckles suggested. Sandra gave her a distasteful look.<br><br>&quot;You&#39;re going to drool on the console, Freckles. And as it happens, no.&quot;<br><br>Freckles&#39; eyebrows shot up. &quot;<b>No</b>? Then she&#39;s Legolas&#39; sister and gets beaten by her evil father while-&quot;<br><br>&quot;She&#39;s <b>going</b> to marry Legolas,&quot; Sandra interrupted. &quot;But it doesn&#39;t get that far. It&#39;s really short – I don&#39;t know why the Flowers gave it to us so early.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Better not to ask,&quot; Freckles muttered. &quot;They&#39;d probably start spouting riddles again. So what&#39;re we being?&quot;<br><br>Sandra glanced over the story summary. &quot;It&#39;s in Mirkwood, so spiders would be the obvious choice, but...&quot; She smirked. &quot;The Sue was nearly killed by orcs once. What do you say we finish the job?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I&#39;ll take my bow.&quot;<br><br>Some Agents find the moment their disguise takes hold to be disorienting, even dizzying. Not so Freckles, who leapt out of the portal with an arrow already in her bow. Sandra followed her through to the dark clearing beneath the shadow of Mirkwood. The ground was covered with incongruously long grass, and what seemed to be the forest&#39;s effort at wildflowers. They were small, black, and seemed to have thorns on their stems.<br><br>&quot;I skipped the flashback,&quot; Sandra commented. &quot;I didn&#39;t think four or five events in the space of a paragraph would be good for us. If you want to write the charge list, you can check the Words.&quot;<br><br>Freckles pretended not to hear her. &quot;So the Sue&#39;s coming to see Legolas here?&quot; she asked, looking around the meadow. Sandra sighed.<br><br>&quot;I guess I&#39;ll do it,&quot; she muttered, pulling out her notepad. &quot;You&#39;ve got your CAD?&quot;<br><br>Freckles dropped her bow to the floor and brandished her Character Analysis Device. &quot;Armed and ready!&quot; she announced. Then she squeaked and dropped the device as it gave an unexpected [Bip!] before joining her bow in the long grass. &quot;I think the Sue&#39;s coming,&quot; she said, dropping to her knees to collect her equipment. Sandra was already on the move, ducking out of sight behind a tree. Freckles, unfortunately, was still scrabbling for her bow when the Sue walked into the clearing.<br><br>The Agents&#39; target for this mission was curiously ill-defined. She was definitely female, elven, and possessing of hair, but other than that, she was lacking in any distinguishing features. From her prone position in the grass Freckles could see both the Sue and the CAD readout.<br><br>[Marilla. Elf female. Non-canon. Mary-Sue.]<br><br>&quot;No kidding,&quot; Freckles whispered, and then bit her lip as Marilla glanced in her direction. Fortunately, the grass seemed to be long enough to keep her hidden (possibly the canon was helping the PPC Agent out, as it sometimes did), and Marilla resumed her wait.<br><br>About an hour later, a glance at the Words showed Freckles the reason for her continued immobility and aching back. Legolas had left Marilla &#39;a note later to meet him at the meadow finally came&#39;. The &#39;finally&#39; was responsible for the long gap between the start of the story and its continuation. Freckles&#39; thoughts turned to Sandra, who she figured was probably relaxing against a tree playing cards or something. She envied her.<br><br>Finally (as the fic had said) Legolas showed up, and Freckles had difficulty containing her laughter. He was wearing a skirt. A long, flowing, emerald-green skirt. It seemed the author had very little idea of how to describe Legolas, and Freckles alternated amusement and fury, as is usual for a Legoluster in the PPC.<br><br><i>&quot;Hello Marilla,&quot;he said walking through the lillys and reaching out to me and squezing me his arms.<br><br>&quot;Hello,ugh Legolas you crushing me &quot;I said laughing as he leaned down and kissed me.</i><br><br>&quot;Don&#39;t we wish,&quot; a soft voice muttered nearby, and Freckles rolled over to see Sandra crawling towards her through the grass and newly-appeared lilies (black, of course – this was Mirkwood). The other woman waved at her. &quot;Were you planning on staying out here for the entire scene?&quot;<br><br>&quot;… it&#39;s fun?&quot; Freckles offered. Sandra shook her head slowly.<br><br>&quot;Come on, Freckles, get with it. You&#39;re going to miss Legolas&#39; epic leap.&quot;<br><br>Indeed she was. Peering through the grass, the Agents watched the elf amble over to a nearby tree and then, without so much as a pause, leap some twenty feet vertically to sit on a branch.<br><br>&quot;I guess she forgot how tall the trees are in Mirkwood,&quot; Freckles said. Sandra nodded.<br><br>&quot;She also forgot why it&#39;s called <b>Mirk</b>wood,&quot; she said. &quot;The gloomy waterfall and falling leaves are very atmospheric, but not quite as romantic as she was hoping.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Not that it seems to be stopping them,&quot; Freckles muttered with thinly-veiled disgust. She was watching the Sue and Legolas. Marilla had walked over and rested her head on Legolas&#39; shoulder (adding to her brief list of features a twenty-foot neck), and they were engaged in possibly the worst dialogue Freckles had seen in, oh, at least two days.<br><br><i>&quot;Well its or wedding day tomorrow I don&#39;t want to spoil anything&quot;I said pulling his face toward me .<br><br>&quot;You wont,and tomorrow we will be one and i will have you forever,&quot;he said leaning over to take my hair and twist it around his fingers<br><br>&quot;I love you Legolas Greenleaf,&quot;I said as I took hold of his hand<br><br>After that he took my chin in his palm and brung me to his mouth</i><br><br>&quot;I wish Sues would be consistent,&quot; Freckles complained. Ignoring Sandra&#39;s stare, she explained, &quot;They call Legolas &#39;Greenleaf&#39;, so they ought to call Boromir &#39;strongjewel&#39; too.&quot;<br><br>&quot;And maybe they could have Gandalf Wandelf and Elrond Stardome,&quot; Sandra agreed. &quot;But it&#39;s not going to happen. We just have to keep writing it down. Speaking of which...&quot; She flipped her notebook open and added to an already-lengthy list of charges. Then she glanced up at the Words.<br><br><i>&quot;With all my heart and soul my love,&quot;He whispered in my ear as he pulled my hair back and kept kissing</i><br><br>&quot;Oh, Manwe. Scene change!&quot;<br><br><i>The next day..</i><br><br>It wasn&#39;t just one scene change. The Agents were dragged to the Sue&#39;s bedroom where she awoke to a vision of floricide which would have given the Sub Rosa an apoplexy (or would have, if the author hadn&#39;t referred to white rose <b>pedals</b> instead), and were then whisked to what appeared to be a small English country church, where they watched the arrival of several million people (&#39;almost all of Middle Earth&#39;) in fast-forward before the Sue&#39;s friend, referred to in the Words as  Vanessielcame, burst into the room.<br><br>&quot;Whats wrong why are you upset?&quot; Marilla asked as Freckles and Sandra tried to stop their heads from spinning. Sandra recovered first, and headed for the door as fast as she could.<br><br>&quot;Wait!&quot; Freckles shouted, but Sandra just threw the charge list at her before disappearing.<br><br><i>&quot;The groom isn&#39;t even here Marillia the wedding is off,&quot; she said looking at me like I was freaking out<br><br>&quot;No he is here he is ......,&quot;I said as I looked down the aisle and .. he wasn&#39;t there ugh!<br><br>Suddenly legolas father-</i><br><br>-did <b>not</b> come from outside. The story jerked to a grinding halt as it tried to deal with the absence of the next speaking character. Freckles leapt into the gap – quite literally. There was a gasp from the assembled multitudes as an orc appeared in front of the bride (although there were at least a million other orcs attending the wedding). Marilla stared at Freckles.<br><br>&quot;Who are you what are you going here?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I&#39;m from the PPC,&quot; Freckles said brightly, &quot;and I&#39;ve got some charges for you. Let&#39;s see...&quot; She looked down at the notebook. Her cheerful expression (somewhat out of place on an orc) fell into a frown. &quot;Is that an e or an i?&quot; she muttered. Marilla, realising that orcs, even ones with notebooks, were probably a bad sign (wedding guests notwithstanding), started to back away. Freckles looked up with narrowed eyes.<br><br>&quot;Forget the list,&quot; she said. &quot;Marilla, you are charged with wanton alteration of the character of Legolas Thranduillion, consistent abuse of the English language, rampant ignorance of the nature of Mirkwood, and generally being an annoying Mary-Sue. Do you have any last words?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Last words?&quot; the Sue repeated. &quot;You can&#39;t kill Legolas will save me&quot;<br><br>&quot;I don&#39;t think so,&quot; Freckles said, and reached over her shoulder. Her frown deepened. &quot;Now, where did I put my bow?&quot;<br><br>There was a loud <b>Twang!</b> from the door of the church. Marilla, Vanessielcame and Freckles all stared with equal astonishment at the arrow protruding from Marilla&#39;s chest. The noise repeated itself, and Vanessielcame sprouted a second, matching arrow. Marilla&#39;s hand came up slowly to touch the fletching on her own.<br><br>&quot;But this is Legolas arrow,&quot; she said, and promptly collapsed. The millions who had gathered to witness her wedding realised they weren&#39;t meant to be there, and swiftly wavered and blinked out. The chapel followed them, passing into nonexistence and leaving Freckles standing on the bank of the Forest River with two corpses and one approaching partner.<br><br>&quot;He didn&#39;t really need that one,&quot; Sandra called, addressing the Sue. &quot;I snitched it from his quiver while you were waiting for him earlier – I thought it seemed appropriate.&quot; She came to a halt in front of her partner, who nodded  approvingly.<br><br>&quot;You blocked Thranduil from coming in,&quot; she said. &quot;Did you hurt him?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Ducked behind a tree and shouted for help,&quot; Sandra said with a shrug. &quot;I figured by the time he&#39;d done searching, you ought to be finished up here. Oh, you can have your bow back.&quot; She held out the orc weapon. Freckles glared at her.<br><br>&quot;She should have been <b>my</b> kill,&quot; she said. Sandra smiled faintly.<br><br>&quot;You got the last one,&quot; she pointed out. &quot;But haven&#39;t we had this discussion before...?&quot;</p>

            <p>I seem to be very bad about that sort of thing. I keep meaning to do it, but life&#39;s rather crazy at the moment.<br><br>Mr Eldritch, I have done two <i>Trek</i> missions so far - one for <i>Voyager</i> and one for the 2009 reboot. You can find the links <a href="http://sedri.livejournal.com/3995.html">here</a> if you scroll down a bit to the &quot;PPC Missions&quot; header. Someday I&#39;ll get them all filed.

            <p>The reason for those 3 installations from microsoft is so that you can upgrade your computer throughout it&#39;s age (changing various components alters that number that was mentioned earlier, so reinstalling the software would count as another install) without allowing you to just install it on as many computers as you like -<br><br>People who reinstall the software multiple times on the same computer can usually just call microsoft to unlock the license if it&#39;s used more than 3 times - it&#39;s a roadblock of inconvenience more than anything.<br><br>You shouldn&#39;t have a problem installing the operating system on both computers, just be aware that you aren&#39;t using it &#39;correctly&#39; - a single upgrade of 7 is supposed to be used on only one computer. </p>

            <p>Windows activation is a remarkably complicated system, as they want to allow someone to reinstall the same computer multiple times, but not allow someone to install the same copy of Windows on multiple computers. The way they do this is they get several somewhat unique numbers to your system (CPU serial number, network adapter&#39;s MAC address, and so on), then mathematically combine them into a number that&#39;s unique to your computer, but doesn&#39;t mean anything else. Then they send that number and the Windows CD key to Microsoft&#39;s magic master servers, which look up that key, and make sure it hasn&#39;t already been used, or that it has been used for the same computer only. The server sends the OK, the computer finishes the install, and everything works.<br><br>Obviously, it&#39;s rather straightforward for Microsoft to set up CD keys that will work for a given number of computers other than one, or CD keys that will work for any number of computers but make a note to a central account somewhere, or so on.<br><br>My one concern would be whether the disk is good for an install and then two reinstalls, or whether it&#39;s good for running three systems concurrently. That would definitely be something worth checking up on before you install it on the second box.</p>

            <p>Earwig&#39;s pockets may turn into a character in their own right.

            <p>Here is my proposed characters. Personality only glossed over, as the majority will probably become apparent as the stories I hope to write progress. Any advice, stipulations, suggestions, complaints or feedback of any sort is appreciated.<br>This is very pre-emptive, as I don&#39;t have a clue what I&#39;m going to write yet, but I&#39;d like to tell what you all think.<br><br>&#39;Mr White&#39;<br>Age: Unknown<br>Species: He looks human (raceless, however), and acts it most of the time. That, of course, doesn&#39;t prove a thing.<br>Gender: Male<br>Partner(s): Whoever he convinces, coerces or blackmails into doing his dirty work.<br>Home Continuum: Won&#39;t talk about, and will have you transferred to the Eskimo Joe section if you don&#39;t stop asking questions<br>Department: Works as a co-ordinator, taking reports and assigning teams as a consequence.<br>Fandom(s): Co-ordinator, working in a range of canons. Prefers Harry Potter.<br>Abilities: Unspecified. He&#39;s in very good physical shape considering his apparent age, and has a flair with quick learning, but rarely shows more then that.<br>Weapon Of Choice: Rarely allows matters do degenerate to fisticuffs.<br><br>Appearance: Dresses in well-cared for suits, that he keeps neatly pressed, of a range of colors. He seems around his early fifties, but his long white hair and beard say different. His features are worn and craggy, lined and liver-spotted with pronounced veins. Despite this, he&#39;s about as feeble as a mountain.<br>Personality: Charismatic, and while he makes almost everybody hate him, they usually wind up doing what he says anyway. His immediate superiors, to their annoyance, quickly found out he was, in fact, so competent and unflappable he was indispensable in the management of the Potter fandom, and have since tolerated him. The only reason he remains out of upper management is he is happy where he is. Has a habit of giving everyone patronizing nicknames, and doesn&#39;t give his respect easily. An old hardass, he possesses less then no tact, rarely bothers with courtesy and has a habit of manipulation even when there is no point to it. Plays the game of politics in his sleep.<br>He is very interested in Mary Sues, some what disturbingly so, and in fact has occasionally offered insightful theories that have turned out to be true. Sometimes even researches it himself.<br><br>Alaric Ivarnsson<br>Age: Eleven<br>Species: panserbjørne<br>Gender: Male<br>Partner(s): Iori<br>Home Continuum: His Dark Materials<br>Department: Assasains. Although his way of dealing with issues is slightly less then subtle, even by assassin standards.<br>Fandom(s): Harry Potter<br>Weapon Of Choice: himself<br><br>Appearance: His fur is well groomed and cared for, far better then any other armored bears, as he can use advanced products while they make do with sea water, steam and animal fat. A few of his fangs are capped, and his eyes are blue due to contact lenses (he is slightly nearsighted as a consequence of reading with little light). He wears the uniform under his armor, which may be against regulations, but nobody seems interested in bringing that up around him.<br>Personality: Quite at odds with his fearsome appearance, he&#39;s a softly spoken, cautious individual, with a somewhat bookish personality. He enjoys literature, country music, the discussion of philosophy and politics (particularly earlier theories) and making utterly useless knick-knacks when he has access to a forge. He is a born collector, and has over two thousand books in his office, on every subject imaginable. It is hard to get him angry. So take the hint. Don&#39;t push him.<br><br>William Bradt<br>Age: Just under thirty<br>Species: human <br>Gender: Male<br>Partner(s):<br>Home Continuum: Warhammer 40K. Previous occupation as a bounty hunter.<br>Department: Department of Mary Sues<br>Multiple offenses division.<br>Fandom(s): Harry Potter<br>Weapon Of Choice: A walking arsenal. Likes knives and other sharp implements, so uses them. Including but not limited to: A Nemesis Force Pike, A red lightsaber, a spool of monomolecular wire, and Hatori Hanzo katana.<br><br>Appearance: A large man, with a heavy-looking skull and a shaved head; appears fairly brutish to most eyes, but  possessed of a graceful style of movement. Trained as a Kasrkin, he always keeps is gear well maintained, and spends spare time cleaning and sharpening it. Doesn&#39;t talk to anyone unless spoken too, in which he gives a gruff, unresponsive, noncommittal answer.<br>Successful at undercover operations as well as those of a more overt nature, and possesses adequate detective skills. Has been accused of liking his job a little too much.<br><br>Iori Tanakka<br>Age: twenty two<br>Species: human (Asian)<br>Gender: Female<br>Partner(s): Alaric Ivarnsson<br>Home Continuum: Unspecified<br>Department: Department of Plagiarism<br>Fandom(s): Harry Potter<br>Weapon Of Choice: She has been trained in martial arts, but the real sort, so any Sue with delusions of competency can curbstomp her in a fair fight. Which is why she works with big scary Alaric Ivarnsson, who can turn any Sue who decides to push the point into a thin red smear with a cuff of his paws. It&#39;s a good system.<br><br>Appearance: A small, willowy Japanese girl. Pretty, in a plain sort of way, shoulder length hair tied back in a messy bun held in place with a tuning fork. Twitchy, hyperactive and unable to hold still for more then a few seconds. Always dresses casually, and seems ready to blurt out information, or anything else that crosses her mind. Sweet natured by personality, she tends to be the voice of reason and mercy.<br><br>Nickolai (no last name)<br>Age: just under forty. Prematurely aged<br>Species: human (Russian)<br>Gender: male<br>Partner(s): works alone<br>Home Continuum: claims to be from Star Trek, but has none of the associated manner, knowledge, or anything.<br>Department: Department of Temporal Offenses<br>Fandom(s): Harry Potter<br>Weapon Of Choice: A modified sniper automatic rifle, with a modified scope and carbine so that it can fire pretty much anything. There is no overkill. There is only the occasional need to reload.<br><br>Appearance: Always dresses in uniform, no modifications or additions. Always neat and calm. Face is very ordinary and plain, his main distinguishing mark is each hand tattooed all over the fingers and knuckles with a chaotic jumble of random letters and simple symbols. Radiates the sharp edge professionalism usually brought on by a lifetime in the army or secret service. He looks around fifty, a brawny man whose muscles are beginning the slide into fat, and a face lined and creased like old leather. His hair is left in messy bangs, a salt and pepper of stubble smatters his jaw and cheeks, and his back was so straight it seemed bent backwards. Wears small, perfect circle glasses when reading.<br>Personality: Be polite. Be efficient. Be professional. Have a plan to kill everyone you meet. Always be neat, never raise your voice, never complain. Always be patient, even if you get angry never let anyone see that you are. Speaks seven languages, and is teaching himself elvish. Good with machines. Never smiles or talks about himself.</p>

            <p>I don&#39;t think you&#39;ve quite grasped how things work. First of all, with only one notable exception, all Departments have a Flower Official as their Head. The Department of Personnel, which is the one in charge of assigning partners and such, is headed by the Marquis de Sod, who is not noted for relying overmuch on underlings. There is a reason the Flowers are in charge. What exactly that reason is varies depending upon who you ask, but the bottom line is that it&#39;s our canon, and we&#39;re not going to mess with it. That said, a secretary in the Department of Personnel with delusions of grandeur could make for interesting stories.<br><br>Second, partners pretty much have to be in the same department, so Alaric in the DMS and Iori in Plagiarism doesn&#39;t work. We don&#39;t really get many cases of plagiarism anyway.<br><br>Third, bear in mind that the PPC isn&#39;t about how badass the agents are. They can do badass things, but unlike Sues, they have to work for it. Alaric worries me a bit on that score because he&#39;s set up to be so much better than his canonical brethren with no explanation for why that might be. I&#39;ve already covered Mr. White.<br><br>All that said, I do like the idea of a panserbjørne working with a scrawny Asian girl, and I like the setup of Nikolai as the proverbial &quot;quiet one&quot; with serious artillery. There are good things working there.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I did pick that up, and I see I&#39;ve been less then clear. My appologies. To clarify:<br>Mr White, as I imagine him, is not upper management, he is middle, one of many beurocrats who then answers to said flowers. a link in the chain, higher then assassins but lower then flowers. As I pictured it, you have the Flowers, who are in the big offices, have board rooms, and decide the policies of their departments, then you have, about four floors down, the bureaucrats like Mr White who handle the actual running of them, dealing with paper work, reports, and passing on orders, and then you have the assassins, who actually do the work.<br>I might be very wrong with how the organization works, <br>As to the agents, I actually based them on people I know, just made them a bit more extreme and some latent budding psychological problems.<br><br>As to Alaric, the armored bears have been described as incredibly strong, however I concede I may have exaggerated it a bit.</p>

            <p>My apologies also.<br><br>The thing is, while the PPC is technically a bureaucracy, it isn&#39;t like our bureaucracies. It&#39;s pretty much just the Board of Department Heads, Department Heads, Division Heads, and the agents. The various Heads might have secretaries, assistants and whatnot, but it doesn&#39;t subdivide after that, so far as I&#39;m aware. So... unless the Department/Division Heads count, there isn&#39;t any middle management. <s>They got shipped off and crash-landed in Earth&#39;s past.</s><br><br>I suppose that&#39;s not to say that there couldn&#39;t be, but I think the hierarchy among the departments pretty much takes care of it, as far as the assignment of partners and missions. In the case of the former, pretty much everyone goes through the Marquis de Sod in Personnel (though not always). He communicates with the Heads in the other departments and arranges for placement, upon which the new agent is the problem of whatever department they end up with, and they would communicate with that Department Head for pretty much everything in the future, including reassignment (unless it were to a different department).<br><br>In the case of missions, the Spies in the Intelligence Department scout out fics beforehand and write up their reports, which go to the Sub Rosa. If it&#39;s a Sue, she sends it to the Sunflower Official, who sends it to the first available team with the requisite canon expertise. If it&#39;s bad slash, it goes to the Queen Anne&#39;s Lace, who sends it on. If it&#39;s a crossover, it goes to the Lichen, who sends it on. If none of them want it, it goes to Floaters, or possibly the Department of WTF. And so on, and so forth. And sometimes mistakes happen, which is our excuse for taking on badfics our agents wouldn&#39;t normally get, so there&#39;s no sense messing with that.<br><br>Both of the aforementioned are aided by the fact that the Flowers are telepathic and have access to ridiculously advanced computers. Heck, the computers might do more deciding than the Flowers.<br><br>I&#39;ll add the caveat that if you think you can get interesting, funny stories out of a guy somewhere in the middle of all that, then no one will object, but I don&#39;t see how it could be a position of actual power/authority without nerfing one of the Flowers, and that probably will raise objections. Which is why I mentioned delusions of grandeur. <i>Imagined</i> power/authority can only be amusing and therefore completely acceptable. {= )<br><br>Moving on: many agents are based on real people, often the people who write for them. That&#39;s totally cool. Even &quot;more extreme&quot; is cool as long as it doesn&#39;t edge into Sue/Studom.<br><br>I wasn&#39;t really concerned with Alaric&#39;s strength so much as the abilities with complex equipment and hygiene that you mentioned, because, as you also mentioned, those aren&#39;t usual for the armored bears. However, there are probably several perfectly good explanations for why he might be different, such as peer pressure from his partner and fellow agents in the case of hygiene. Also, I seem to recall that Iorek Byrnison was supposed to get them to clean up their act a bit as King, but I could be misremembering that.<br><br>Anyway. The cardinal rule of the PPC is humor, so as long as it&#39;s all for fun and fun for all, there shouldn&#39;t really be problems. It&#39;s just that I&#39;ve seen a lot of new people come through with big ideas that don&#39;t follow that rule, and you DID come in guns blazing on the Wiki, so my tendency is to raise my eyebrows and maybe come off a bit harsh until I&#39;m sure I know what&#39;s going on. Or rather, until I&#39;m sure that YOU know what&#39;s going on. {= ) So, keep reading the Original Series and whatever other PPC stories take your fancy, keep your ideas in mind, and we&#39;ll see what happens in about a month, yes?<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I think it was less than clear that the reason Alaric is much better groomed than his canonical brethren is the fact that he has access to industrial-strength shampoos and a partner interested or bored enough to use it to good effect. If I&#39;m reading what you wrote correctly, that&#39;s the only area where he&#39;s leaps and bounds ahead of canonical panserbjørne?<br><br>(As far as strength and innate metalworking ability go, yes, panserbjørne are very strong and good with metals. It&#39;s innate to the species, and not something that&#39;s easy to remove. You&#39;ll have to dance the very careful dance of how-much-is-too-much with that one, I wish you the best, as the two of them look like they&#39;ll be very interesting partners to read.)</p>

            <p>Oh, the band is AWESOME. Even if you don&#39;t like their music, you can&#39;t not love their backstory. The bassist and singer met when the former ran the latter over. Twice. And they kidnapped the drummer, who has the ghosts of his dead friends trapped in his head, and their guitarist, aged ten, arrived in a FedEx crate from Japan.<br><br>Yeah, I sort of stopped doing those when the number of students got sorta unwieldy.

            <p>I know DOGA has a few suncrushers, but what are the rules about sending a vehicle through a portal?  If I&#39;m doing a mission that takes place in space, will I be able to enter the story from my response center and generate a ship in the canon or will I have to go to a special hangar and fly a DSAT-built ship through a portal there?  Also, if a sue I&#39;m trying to kill has a world 1 compatible car, can I take that back to the real world with me *(Which would require portalling somewhere besides my RC)?</p>

            <p>Before you start thinking about how to get a spaceship into the mission, try this question:<br><br>*Is there a way to do the mission <i>without</i> giving my Agents high technology?<br><br>If, for instance, it&#39;s a Star Trek mission, could the Agents spend all their time on the Enterprise? The only situation I can think of where a spaceship would be needed is if the canons are all space-faring robots, and thus don&#39;t have internal corridors.<br><br>Remember that the PPC is hideously underfunded. If there&#39;s a low-tech way of doing things, they will <i>not</i> use a more expensive method instead.<br><br>As to stealing a car from a Sue -- loot is part of the fun.

            <p>If an agent does steal or otherwise commandeer a vehicle for assassination purposes - for example, if there&#39;s no way to take the Sue down without one - one could always get some humour out of the agent trying to figure out how to pilot it. To expand on your example, Agent Clark Kent taking a TIE and desperately trying to figure out how to fly the thing and shoot Pink Five down without crashing into something or getting blown up. Just my opinion, though.</p>

            <p>A cooking mini-rayquaza! Nice! If you don&#39;t mind holding on to one of them for a not-yet-recruit (and if there is not any paperwork to fill out first--I don&#39;t <i>think</i> that there&#39;s a Pokémon University), I would love to have one. It could definitely be a great addition to my RC. I wonder what a Suefflé would taste like?<br><br>By the way, how large do they grow? I would still enjoy being able to get from one side of the RC to the other.</p>

            <p>No Trojies? Okay. Permission granted! So stop worrying so much. ^_~<br><br>I agree with Helen about your story--I like that the character&#39;s voice comes through so well. It&#39;s a very elegant (if melancholy) summation of a person&#39;s life. I&#39;m sure there are real people just like her. There are a few small mechanical errors (&quot;week to week&quot; should not be hyphenated there, toward the end; and &quot;would still <u>had have</u> food left-over&quot; should be &quot;would still <u>have had</u> food left over&quot;), but once those all get fixed up you might think about sending it to a magazine or something. Can&#39;t hurt to try, anyway. {= )<br><br>I do still wonder about Eileen&#39;s third arm, though. I mean, I&#39;m sure Medical could have removed it... so why keep it?

            <p>I&#39;m crazy, letting myself in for this. I&#39;ve heard that insanity is an asset, though? Anyway, I would like (hah!) to join PPC, after the month or two of board presence required before requesting permission. This might actually turn out to be longer, as the short story I believe would be the best style submission is currently only a few sentences and a well-planned idea (my others are idea-and-few-sentence-long <i>chaptered</i> stories).<br><br>Anyway, a bit more introduction could be helpful. I&#39;m called (as you can see) Goldenrod111 (nicknames derived from that are fine, though including the &quot;Gold&quot; is the best way to get my attention). The hundred and ten (or two) other &quot;Goldenrod&quot;s are, to the best of my knowledge, unharmed--I just really enjoy that number. I enjoy well-written stories and am planning rather enjoyable things to the Mary Sues who ruin them <small><i>&lt;gollum&gt;Curse them! We hates them!&lt;/gollum&gt;...Sorry!</i></small> I have tried (see above) writing several stories of my own, and love hearing about a character&#39;s inner conflict, rather than the external (read &quot;often artificial&quot;) problems that most stories revolve around. The department I think I would enjoy the DTE the most, but I don&#39;t have <i>quite</i> the attention to detail required for it (I would have completely missed the hull-full misrhyme), so I think I will write in the DMS. Now &lt;abrupt topic change /&gt; I have a few questions to ask.<br><br>1.  What are the rules regarding recruitment from an original canon? I have seen at least one agent on the wiki with that designation, and I know that several other agents were taken from the real world, but what about using a character from a world that I have created (don&#39;t worry--I won&#39;t go easy on him)? Are there any special regulations regarding these characters? How would the PPC and my character learn of each other for the recruitment, or should I just not mention that?<br><br>2.  Is there a better way of tracking messages across the board than using the five-entry RSS feed? I have clicked the box below this box for the daily updates, but I have a feeling that that is only for this thread. With the amount of messages that go through here, there really <i>should</i> be some better way of tracking new information.<br><br>3.  Can I put in an early request for RC #421? I know it looks random, but there is some sense to it (one part is earlier in the post, the other is 5. Who can come up with the reason?)<br><br>I am sure that I had a few other questions, but I can&#39;t remember them at the moment. Maybe in the next post! <br><br><i>The interested recruit laughs maniacally and drags his hand--the last sensible part of his body--from several buttons that would delete the message, before forcing it to click on the &quot;Post&quot; button.</i></p>

            <p>I agree. You can do things with an OC that you would never be able to do with someone else&#39;s agent, customize them to an extent that would otherwise be impossible. Does anyone know where I can find a preferably female, not very Sueish Sue, possibly with some love of pointy daggers (I got a nice set of them from Cinnia Aine), that shows promise as an agent? It&#39;s difficult to find someone that matches what I&#39;m imagining, but I hope that I&#39;ll be able to find someone that is close enough in a mission-worthy badfic.<br><br>Thanks for the grammar and the slang! I&#39;m sure that the grammar will give my agents a bit of comfort in the turbulence of a badly-written story, and I&#39;m sure that I will be able to come up with a use for the slang once I learn what it is (time to talk to my parents!)</p>

I don&#39;t seem to be that far from it, though--I doubt that the little sanity I have left would be enough to feed even a newborn warg. I do enjoy Tolken--I&#39;m not <i>that</i> crazy. I probably won&#39;t venture into that canon for a while, though. I still need to read most of the non-main-series books.<br><br>Thanks for the information on recruiting one of my characters. I was going to use a plothole if there wasn&#39;t some other established method of recruiting agents (excluding contacting the target--that would be harder to explain than a plothole!) I think I will attempt to insert whatever humor I can get into finding the plothole and my character&#39;s reaction to it. I don&#39;t think that he will be over-powered; he&#39;s a werewolf, but characterized in such a way that it might actually be more of a threat to his sanity than the Sues! Finding a nickname for him shouldn&#39;t be too hard--he currently doesn&#39;t have a name for it to replace!<br><br>I&#39;m trying out that update-mailing link you gave me, gattsuru, but it does seem like the classic method is best. *adds page to home tabs*<br><br>It makes sense to ask for the RC in the same post as the permission. I was just wondering if there was a partially-reserved state for the rooms. Oh well. It&#39;s an odd enough number that I can&#39;t imagine anyone (other than me, that is) asking for it.<br><br>I found the answer to one of my forgotten questions (the postal department is in Infrastructure, not in the Discontinued section) and remembered another (below), but I do distinctly remember having three questions. I wonder if I&#39;ll remember it, or if it is gone forever.<br><br>I&#39;m going to use FictionPress for posting my non-PPC stories (yes, I know that it&#39;s the Pit&#39;s sister, but the stories there are generally of a better quality. Who would have thought that creating an original world requires a higher level of coherence?), but I have not seen a list of rules. Where are they? I would hate to be deleted through ignorance.<br><br>Finally, thanks for all of the gifts, and especially the bleeprin! I&#39;m compiling a list, and challenging myself to fit everything in the story. Expect to see them in print! <small>Now...how many ways can I think of to get a Sue to meet a venomous arthropod?</small></p>

            <p>Do you have any connections to the DMSE&amp;R? I already have enough things for my agents to collect, and don&#39;t think that giving one of them a fascination for Sue sanity would add anything (a sense that many Suethors strangely seem to be lacking). However, if there is some way to get the DMSE&amp;R involved, we have a semi-reasonable sequence of events.

No, I don&#39;t think there are any special rules about agents from original continua. They shouldn&#39;t be massively over-powered (or if they are it should rarely ever work to their advantage), but that goes for everyone. As for how they find out about the PPC, if you&#39;ve no other way to justify it, there is always the good old standby of falling into HQ through a rogue plothole. {= )<br><br>2. I&#39;m not familiar with RSS, but my eyes have worked extremely well for me for years now. ^_~ It&#39;s really not that much to keep track of.

Just make sure you tag &quot;RC request&quot; along with &quot;Permission request&quot; in the post title, because Araeph maintains the list of RCs by herself, so you need to make sure she knows about it.<br><br>Fear not the post button!

            <p>I&#39;ve not got Permission yet, but this is the general feel I&#39;ve gotten so far :<br><br>There are a number of canon-recruit agents, as well as those recruited from badfic or the real world.  <i>Most</i> canon recruits from published works are very minor characters destined for death, or AU versions of a minor character, and it should be well-justified.  See <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/FAQ:_For_Newbies#Characters_can_be_recruited.2C_right.3F_Does_that_mean_I_can_save_a_character_who_died_in_canon_and_bring_them_to_work_in_the_PPC.3F">this part of the Newbie FAQ</a>.  These rules aren&#39;t hard-coded -- there&#39;s an Agent Wash from a Firefly AU, for example -- but it&#39;s a good guideline.  Those recruited from the canon or from badfic do typically pick a nickname of some sort. <br><br>From worlds that you&#39;ve created or your own fanfic, however, it&#39;s a bit easier.  Some agents have been built like that, or <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Mission_Writing_Guide#Can_I_say_my_agent_went_to_an_OFU_even_if_I_didn.E2.80.99t_officially_register_them_when_the_fic_was_being_written.3F_What_about_if_they_come_from_a_badfic.3F_Does_it_have_to_be_a_real_badfic.3F">they can even come from entirely made-up works</a>.<br><br>There&#39;s a &quot;<a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/disc-list-subscribe.cgi?id=199610">Receive Daily Updates</a>&quot; option at the bottom of the <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/Indices/199610.html">main forum page</a>, but I&#39;ve not tested it personally.<br><br>It&#39;s best to wait <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/FAQ:_For_Newbies#Can_I_post_my_agent_bios_on_the_wiki_or_request_an_RC_before_getting_Permission.3F">until you&#39;re requesting Permission</a> to request a RC.<br><br>On the more general greeting side : <br><br>You&#39;ve mentioned the PPC wiki&#39;s a great place to start, and it&#39;ll eventually get you everywhere. I&#39;d recommend <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/FAQ:_The_Board">the Board FAQ</a> if you&#39;ve not already seen it. If you plan to write PPC missions, take a look at <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Permission">the Permission</a> article and the Manual -- it&#39;s a good guide on what the PPC does, and the humor <a href="http://www.freewebs.com/ppc_manual/index.htm">they try to do it with</a>. The <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Mission_Writing_Guide">Mission Writing Guide</a> can be a great help at figuring out answers to the more common questions, or finding questions that you wouldn&#39;t have thought of otherwise.  There&#39;s also the <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/the_ppc/20306.html">Big List of Everything PPC</a> if you want to find new PPC missions to read.<br><br>You&#39;ve mentioned the wiki, so I&#39;ll assume you may have already see <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Legendary_badfic">the article on Legendary Badfic</a>. Either way: before forewarned that they really are that bad and you don&#39;t (and if you want to keep whatever good taste you had, maybe shouldn&#39;t) feel like it&#39;s a test. Reading normal badfic is enough of a masochistic thing; it&#39;s better to stay at stabbing insanity rather than brain-breakingly flamethrower crazy.<br><br>And, in the tradition of providing newbies with random goods... *hands Goldenrod111 a mug of dandelion fizz*</p>

            <p>I&#39;m sure this will be the last of my question threads, now that I have the time to ask all of the unanswered ones...<br><br>1. Why is the PPC so protective of World One? Is it just their duty, or is it simply &quot;special&quot; in some way that makes it of high importance?<br><br>2. People fall into HQ from World One through plotholes, right? Plotholes obviously aren&#39;t very stable, so can things happen to the people in transport, like changing species, personality, and so on?<br><br>...Gaaah. Can&#39;t ask them all right now, I&#39;ll get the rest up shortly...</p>

<li>Only if there is a well thought out plot related reason for it.<br><br>1. Because... ... You know, I haven&#39;t words for this. You do *know* our MO, right? Protect the canon from the Suefluence, etc? World One is the canon of canons; it&#39;s reality. It&#39;s the canon within which all other canons are formed. It&#39;s the canon most agents come from. It&#39;s the canon that has, like, biology and physics and shit that, er, works. We abandon it at our peril, because to abandon World One is to abandon logic and sanity and maths and physics and biology and pretty much everything that gives one a basis by which to judge a deviation from canon.<br><br>If you have to ask this, I feel you may be missing something.

<li>Part of the reason is that the Flowers -- or rather, their non-sentient ancestors -- came from World One. This implies that their homeworld of Origin is/was in the same universe as World One. Another is that... well, I&#39;ll move onto the second question.<br><br>2. Another response to question 1 is that Agents tend to fall through plotholes from World One a lot more often than from elsewhere. Agents from, say, Middle-earth tend to have been recruited directly. I don&#39;t know why that is.<br><br>As to plotholes changing people -- I suppose they <i>could</i>. In my conception of the Way Of Things, there&#39;s a whole bunch of different types of plotholes -- a geographical-abberation plothole would bring you to HQ, say, while a genderbending plothole would turn you into a girl/boy, depending. Since Mary-Sues create and to an extent use plotholes, having a plothole which does both would need you to identify a source -- a canon where there&#39;s a lot of fics involving simultaneous relocation and transportation. Lots of Sues are dragged from one world to another. Lots of Sues force canons to physically change. Not many do both at once, so they can&#39;t be too common.<br><br>(And, since I&#39;m here...)<br><br>3. No-one in the entire history of recorded missions has been forced into the PPC. Some have been given pretty leading choices -- &quot;We have to kill you unless you join&quot; is basically what Jay and Acacia said to Ranger -- but never actually forced.<br><br>4. Ah, but are they?<br><br>Seriously. <i>Fanfics</i> are made up of words, or at least heavily shaped by them -- the DTE tends to run into showers of punctuation and entities like Lady Contrivance, and we know Agents can actually read the Words from inside the world. But has anyone ever tried in uncorrupted canon? It may well be that the Words are an alien intrusion which bends a preexisting world to match someone else&#39;s shape. Since the PPC doesn&#39;t destroy original fiction (ie, since even really bad canon characters don&#39;t create dangerous plotholes, which is the reason Sues are killed, at least in my version), that would mean that each <b>original</b> work of fiction is essentially a channelling by a World One author of an alternate, real world in another dimension.<br><br>Not that only World One authors can create universes. The Musee de Universes Perdu in New Caledonia contains, as I recall, fiction from Gallifrey before its fall. The reason we don&#39;t see mission reports on those is that we wouldn&#39;t know what was going on.<br><br>(Hey, anyone want to write a PPC mission set in <i>The Grasshopper Lies Heavy</i>?)<br><br>hS</li>

            <p>It&#39;s a fascinating little question. <br><br>Presumably, agents don&#39;t vanish into nothingness in between missions, yet those are not points at which we Boarders are writing them, so that could be evidence that they are more autonomous than pure word-only creations.<br><br>I think, though, that in terms of various canons, I lean towards the notion that they are alternate-ish universes which aren&#39;t supposed to interact with our World One (except through the harmless transmission of their greatest stories by the honoured natives we call authors), except that they have, hence the tangled mess we call the Multiverse. It seems to make the most sense in terms of the world we play in at the moment.</p>

            <p>Here&#39;s some more of the questions.<br><br>3. Are there any specific circumstances that one can be &quot;forced&quot; into the PPC? (I expect not, but worth asking.)<br><br>4. As all the continua (Except maybe World One) are &quot;created&quot; by authors and the like as Word Worlds, doesn&#39;t this technically mean that the people inside them (And by extension, everything created in a Real Person Fic)are made of words, too?

<li>No.<br><br>4. You run the risk of getting dangerously philosophical. Are we not all made simply of words? For the purposes of this shared universe: the words make reality, here. We are all words, yet all we are is words, and so shall we be, whether within or without fic. We write in a collaborative <i>written</i> community; every world is made of words. Real people in World One are just as much merely words as any agent; we are all, and we all write, mere words. <br><br>What matters is the weight you attribute to those words. <br><br>(Or: every continua is <i>written</i>. That&#39;s kind of half the point.)</li>

            <p>1) No, people are not forced to join the PPC. Even Nursery children raised in HQ don&#39;t *have* to be Agents.<br><br>2) Sort of.

<li>It isn&#39;t. In fact, if anything, World One gets <i>less</i> protection than other continua, considering the fact that we-the-writers generally prefer to avoid dealing with Real Person fic, Bible fic, and other such Real World-based stories. Don&#39;t know where you got that idea.<br><br>2. People fall into HQ from lots of places through plotholes. I suppose something like that could happen, though I don&#39;t believe it ever has. But, if you want a character with a certain species and personality, there&#39;s no reason not to simply write them that way in the first place, without the <i>deus ex machina</i> and shenanigans.<br><br>~Neshomeh </li>

            <p>*apologizes to thread that has now been shoved off the front page*<br><br>I&#39;ve been <s>wasting</s> spending my time reading a few webcomics, so I decided to promote two that I don&#39;t think have been mentioned here in a while. <br><br><a href="http://mary-sue-academy.deviantart.com/">Mary Sue Academy</a><br><br>This one is an obvious spoof of Mary Sues and their world, but it goes into the Mary Sues&#39; points of view, as well as the Mary Sue Hunters and other people who appear. The art is good, as is the plot line. Also, it&#39;s quite funny, especially if you&#39;ve read any Sue Slayer fics or PPC missions. (And yes, you will start to like some of the Mary Sues.)<br>Warnings: Some content is NSFW, but the hosting website should let you know what is NSFW by the mature content block. It&#39;s mostly gore and language, really. Nothing to seriously worry about. <br><br><a href="http://www.elfonlyinn.net/">Elf Only Inn</a><br><br>I just barely began reading this webcomic, but it&#39;s definitely worth the time spent reading it, from what I&#39;ve read so far. It&#39;s a funny cut and paste webcomic about roleplaying chatrooms. Watch out, though. It will suck you into its vortex of side-splitting humor. (The webcomic isn&#39;t updated any more, but there&#39;s plenty of past comics to read through.)<br>Warnings: Some content isn&#39;t for kids under the age of ten, I guess. I don&#39;t think there&#39;s anything else to warn about.<br><br>Who has heard of these two webcomics and who hasn&#39;t? I&#39;m interested to know because I haven&#39;t seen these discussed on the board since I arrived here last April, (I think).</p>

            <p>I don&#39;t expect many replies tonight, since you&#39;re all probably out being Irish (as age restrictions permit), but as the resident teetotaler, I don&#39;t really care. {= D So, here we are.<br><br>For those of you who may have missed the memo, two weeks ago I threw down a challenge to write a mission if you have Permission, or just write anything at all, as long as you complete it during the month of March. Could be something you&#39;ve had on the back burner, half-finished, mostly finished, completely new, whatever--just so long as it gets finished and made available to read before midnight of March 31 in whatever your time zone happens to be. There is no word count. There is no word limit. Just get it done!<br><br>For those who make it, I am offering your choice of fabulous prizes! I will:<br><br>a) beta-read your piece (since I&#39;m not requiring entries to be beta-read ahead of time);<br>b) draw something for you (e.g. a character or simple scene);<br>c) write a drabble about the topic of your choice (provided I know what you&#39;re on about).<br><br>Only one reward per person, though, because I want to get them all done sometime this year. Make sure to tell me what you want when you plug your piece! For things completed before this post, go ahead and tell me what you want in a reply here. I&#39;ll start a list.<br><br>For the record, I have finished my interlude, but I&#39;m going to wait before posting. Partly this is because I have plenty of time and other things to worry about, but also because I was silly and sent it off to bother Sedri before I remembered my own challenge terms. But then again, I haven&#39;t got anyone offering me fabulous prizes, so perhaps it&#39;s okay. Or maybe my brain is made of feathers. &gt;.&gt;<br><br>Meanwhile, how are the rest of you doing? Have you selected your target? Entered the fic? Alternatively, have you chosen your subject? Characters going where they&#39;re supposed to go? How far are you? Inquiring minds <s>well, just mine, really</s> want to know!<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

That way if I see something of interest to post about, nobody will be confused as to who I am. Nobody much, anyway.<br>I have more of an interest in history than I do nonfiction, these days, but I do enjoy pirate movies (POTC, etc.), science fiction, and Redwall. <br>That&#39;s all.

            <p>Okay. As a perpetual questioner...<br><br>1. Is this badfic? A friend of mine likes it. I say sic the Department of Implausible Crossovers on it.<br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5551303/1/Of_Sleepers_Shyness_and_Music_Motifs"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5551303/1/Of_Sleepers_Shyness_and_Music_Motifs">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5551303/1/Of_Sleepers_Shyness_and_Music_Motifs</a></a><br><br>2. I&#39;ve seen a lot of griping about in-text author&#39;s notes; what&#39;s the official standpoint on notes that are very clearly separated from the text of the story? I like them - they&#39;re sort of like those DVD extras in my mind.<br><br>3. I don&#39;t have permission and will be lacking in both permission and time for a bit, but would it be okay for me to post some characters anyway in case of roleplays and so I&#39;ll have plenty of time to work out all the problems?<br><br>4. This last one is more due to my love for weird hypothetical questions, but can anyone think of situations when things that are normally causes might not be? Like, if you were writing from the perspective of a character, and that character canonically had bad grammar, you&#39;d have to. Same goes for urple prose. <br><br>So, uh, yeah.</p>

<li>I don&#39;t know anything about Final Fantasy before or after VII, so can&#39;t help here.<br><br>2. I don&#39;t know if there is an official stance, but certainly the <i>prevailing</i> stance is that in-story author&#39;s notes distract from the story and are annoying; the place for author&#39;s notes is at the beginning or the end of the story/chapter, not within.<br><br>3. If you mean the wiki, then no, we prefer people to wait until they have Permission to post their characters. However, there&#39;s nothing stopping you from putting them somewhere else, such as wherever you intend to post your missions when you DO have Permission. {= )<br><br>4. Assuming by &quot;causes&quot; you meant &quot;charges&quot;... But yeah, there are plenty of circumstances like that. It&#39;s all about whether the fanfic violates the canon, and how badly. If a character speaking with bad grammar is canon, then it wouldn&#39;t be a charge in a fanfic (unless the ENTIRE FIC had horrible grammar).<br><br>5. Agent training: possibly one of the most confused issues we have. Technically the answer is &quot;yes,&quot; but the fact is that most agents never get it. Mostly they&#39;re just assigned a partner and learn everything from them, because if they don&#39;t they&#39;ll die horribly. For more on this, see the Manual, <a href="http://www.freewebs.com/ppc_manual/Volume01.htm#v">Volume 1, Chapter 5</a>.<br><br>Hope that helps. {= )<br><br>~Neshomeh</li>

            <p>The Nursery has classes for rescued young bit characters, ex-Mary Sues, and badfic offspring both conventional and mpreg.  Even post-Nursery Graduation, though, the characters don&#39;t tend to be particularly prepared for whatever Department or Division that they are assigned to -- naive may be a bit on the less descriptive side.  Agent Oscar came out with a decent grasp of Sindarin, but was surprised that a Suethor would ignore that whole &quot;elves die when raped&quot; thing Tolkien had going on.  Marsha&#39;s last mission still had her getting a hold of the concept of knees.  That might be less an official Nursery Policy, and more just the unofficial policy that a several-ton dinosaur can take whatever disguise (or non-disguise) it wants.<br><br>Some rescued adult bit characters often have to spend some time in FicPsych.  <a href="http://starshadowhall.tripod.com/ppc/ficpsych/casefile01.html">Neshomeh&#39;s work with Agent Ilraen</a> is the most detailed example I&#39;ve see.  You might or might not consider this training, but it can include some technical knowledge, combat training, or other information if those would be part of a normal life experience for someone with the potential Agent&#39;s species and cultural background.<br><br>Stormsong and Skyfire mentioned at least some hologram training missions.  It&#39;s not clear if these are typical -- the Queen Anne&#39;s Lace is a little kinder to &#39;her&#39; Agents than the Marquis de Sod or other Flower Heads treat everyone -- but they don&#39;t seem commonly described.<br><br>Others pretty much just get dumped immediately on another Agent, and this seems the most common path.  Agent Ranger spent a half hour in the Department of Personnel dealing with paperwork, got partnered up with someone, and went speeding on his way.<br><br>And yet others don&#39;t get even that : Agents JulyFlame and Library only had a copy of the manual.  They were surprised by the [BEEEEEP] and didn&#39;t quite get the hang of the Disguise Generator for quite a long time.</p>

            <p>Direct quote from the wiki: <br>&quot;Health and Safety consists of giving new agents a few minutes training with their shiny new weaponry before throwing them at, for instance, rampaging Jedi/Amazon Sues.&quot;<br><br>...so make of that what you will.<br>I do know that the Nursery has a day-care-type-thing which trains the older kids up a bit, but beyond that...

            <p>Technically hS is in charge of the Manual, and I think there were one or two other people with the password to the account, but I have no idea what hS&#39;s feelings are about it these days, and pretty much everyone else moved on.

            <p>Thank you, Tooth Fairy.<br><br>That is strange, because it&#39;s still there, and it looks like the kind of error that comes when an html tag is dropped.

            <p>I&#39;m not sure what you&#39;re seeing, but the page looks fine to me. Unlike the wiki, the manual is set up so that <i>all</i> links show red. Is it something beyond this?

            <p>I guess I forgot to mention that possibility clearly in my response, but I was thinking about it! I just pulled the page up in IE (I normally use Firefox) and got the same problem. Does anyone get this in any other browser? I did run a test of this, though. The page code alone seems to work well, so check it with the .css (I didn&#39;t see one) file(s), or whatever gives the page its appearance. If the problem is still present, I recommend switching to Firefox, as it is likely a problem with FreeWebs.</p>

            <p>March Madness -- GOAL.<br>It&#39;s been over a year since the last mission I wrote; it was nice to stretch these muscles again.

It&#39;s a fairly standard shonen manga/anime, about a teenaged boy, Tsunayoshi Sawada, who is wholly useless. Unfortunately, he&#39;s the sole remaining eligible candidate for the position of the tenth-generation boss of a large and influential mafia family. Hijinks ensue. I do recommend it if you have spare time and/or a burning need to expand your fandoms. It can be a bit silly/monotonous/etc. for the first ~60 chapters/ ~20 episodes, occasionally called the &#39;Daily Life&#39; arc, but after that it quickly becomes a whole lot more epic.<br>Sadly for the canon characters, the majority of them are pretty boys.<br><br>I acknowledge that most people probably won&#39;t even bother, given how few seem to know the fandom. Still, it got done, and that has to count for something. ^_^</p>

            <p>Hello all,<br><br>I just thought I&#39;d register on here and say hello to you all and introoduce myself a little.<br><br>I&#39;m 23 and from the UK, have been a Fanfic reader for many, many years, attempted to write some before, however never posted any of my stuff online, oh, and I get terribly irritated by awful badfic! (it makes my skin crawl in a terrible way!) I remember reading on FF.net a long while ago, a Harry Potter story, where Harry decides to join Slytherin and beds Draco....Need I say more? I definitely wanted to find and savagely beat the author with a rusty spoon!<br><br>Anyway, I&#39;m wanting to try flexing my writing muscles again, and see where it takes me. I&#39;ll try and post on here as often as possible. Some of you I&#39;ve already met on the IRC channel - last night was amusing!<br><br>Let the insanity begin!<br><br>-Sev</p>

Especially helpful for you if you want to write missions would be the page on <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Permission">Permission</a> (note the capital P).<br><br>I would advise against reading any <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Legendary_badfic">Legendary Badfic</a>, unless you are of strong mind and stomach. Even the summaries have been known to give those of weaker constitution nightmares.<br><br>For your reading pleasure, not knowing what you have already managed to find, I have several links for you. <a href="http://www.misssandman.com/PPC/story.html">The Original Series</a> (not to be confused with Star Trek) is a good place to start, as the PPC did many aeons ago. <s>What do you mean I&#39;m exaggerating?</s> <a href="http://www.freewebs.com/bonsaimallorn/">The Department of Geographical Aberrations</a> is another interesting place to visit, if you have the time and inclination. Also by hS is the <a href="http://www.freewebs.com/ppchistory/index.htm">Tangled Webs</a> site, which contains backstory for the PPC as an organisation. If you would rather visit the Floaters, then <a href="http://julyppc.webs.com/">July&#39;s site</a> is the place you need to be. And last, but most definitely not least, <a href="http://rc45.dreamwidth.org/">Response Centre 45</a> is where Trojie and Pads&#39; missions are archived.<br><br>Hope you enjoy your stay here. Please deposit your sanity into the container offered to you by another Boarder; you won&#39;t be needing it here. <br><br>Ooh, the UK, huh? Whereabouts in this <s>fair</s> country would you happen to be, if you don&#39;t mind me asking.<br><br>Slytherin!Harry/Draco is a pairing that just. won&#39;t. die!

            <p>...It&#39;s really bothering me that, well, it doesn&#39;t come across that you know exactly what I took umbrage at here. In fact the impression I get is that you made what you thought was a joke, and you&#39;re contrite because it seems not everyone found it funny, and you&#39;re just smiling and nodding and saying &quot;Okay, I was wrong&quot;.<br><br>For one thing, if your teacher says paedophile jokes are okay on the internet then your teacher needs firing.<br><br>For another thing, Counsellorface says I need to let people actually <i>know</i> what it is I need and expect from people, rather than getting arsey when people don&#39;t know and accidentally upset me, so I will say it outright now: Paedophilia is not funny. It is not a source of joking, and it never will be. If it is ever a source of amusement here, I&#39;m out, and not coming back, because for me, it&#39;s not comedy, it&#39;s a source of daily suffering. I&#39;m sure paedophile jokes are funny to some people. Same as the way rape jokes are funny to some people. To the people actually affected by such things, it&#39;s not so much funny as &quot;hey, let&#39;s laugh at my pain&quot;. So can we please have a bit of consideration before making such hilarious jokes at other people&#39;s expense?</p>

            <p>It was that way for a while, but it seems to have gotten better. Try again, and if it still looks bad, hold Shift and click on the Refresh button. If that doesn&#39;t work, follow <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Special:Preferences">this link</a> to your preferences, go to the &quot;Skin&quot; tab, select any option other than &quot;Slate&quot; (I like the look of &quot;Brick&quot; for the wiki, but &quot;Beach&quot; doesn&#39;t look bad either), and uncheck &quot;Let the admins override my skin preference.&quot; You should see the wiki in different colors and you will loose customized skins on other wikis, but at least you will be able to read this one!</p>

            <p>Hi. <br><br>I&#39;m Artell, and July dragged me here so it&#39;s all her fault. I don&#39;t really come from a fanfic background, I&#39;ve dabbled in writing some in my young wilder years, but I know terrible writing when I see it (mostly my own). I also love picking apart terrible writing (again mostly my own...) I also try to substitute self-deprecation for humour. <br><br>I&#39;m interested in doing missions but I&#39;m just getting the hang of things and familiarizing myself with the PCCverse for now. <br><br>My major fandoms, that I&#39;m very familiar with, are: Babylon 5, Battlestar Galactica*, Star Trek (mainly TNG), Evangelion, Mass Effect, Star Wars (OT+PT, not EU). <br><br>Minor fandoms that I am fairly knowledgeable in are: A Song of Ice and Fire (haven&#39;t read the latest book yet), The West Wing, various Gundam incarnations (mainly UC), a bunch of British stuff like Blackadder, Life on Mars. Discworld too, to a degree, I&#39;ve only read the Watch books as yet. I&#39;m a work in progress.<br><br>I don&#39;t know if some of this stuff even has a fandom. <br><br>* &quot;Which version&quot;? Yeah, actually, I think Starbuck should be a man, and that scifi should be terrible.<br></p>

            <p>*pokes*<br><br>Oooh, sci-fi. I can&#39;t tell if you&#39;re being sarcastic about <i>Battlestar Galactica</i>, though. I like the re-imagined series a lot, personally, but that&#39;s all I&#39;ve seen.<br><br>Anyway. If you like all that, I highly recommend <i>Farscape</i> and <i>Firefly</i>. They both suffered the same fate of being canceled before their time due to network stupidity, and also of making a comeback with a miniseries and movie respectively, due to their fanbases making a ridiculous amount of enraged noise. This probably says something about the shows and the fanbases.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Oh, I actually have seen all of Firefly and Serenity, so I guess that&#39;s one fandom I&#39;m technically qualified to police. <br><br>also, i bet you&#39;re going to become way more dedicated and better than me at this community too, you terribly terribly competent person. </p>
