            <p>Hey. Is it possible to just report a badfic author rather than just a badfic? The one I came across is consistently bad, no matter what the fandom. For example, she crosses <i>BtVS</i> with <i>Twilight</i>, which in itself is kind of funny (&quot;And then Buffy staked Edward. The End&quot;), but the way the author does it is <i>horrible</i>. I can&#39;t stand Twilight and I cringed at the badness of it. She seems to be obsessed with the current pack of Disney-made stars- The Jonas Brothers, the kids from HSM, etc. Please, someone kill these badfics!<br><br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/u/1996953/The_Giant_Dorito_of_Doom"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/u/1996953/The_Giant_Dorito_of_Doom">http://www.fanfiction.net/u/1996953/The_Giant_Dorito_of_Doom</a></a></p>

            <p>This is one of those &quot;so bad he&#39;s good&quot; authors. Another one I like (for a very loose definition of &quot;like&quot;) is Hans Van Hozel.<br><br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/u/1730364/Hans_von_Hozel"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/u/1730364/Hans_von_Hozel">http://www.fanfiction.net/u/1730364/Hans_von_Hozel</a></a><br><br>He apparently wants to write a fic for every fandom on the site, but he&#39;s... not very good. Don&#39;t miss the Titanic ones or the ones about the Beatles fighting ABBA. Also apparently &quot;danube&quot; is a verb.</p>

            <p>You can certainly report all the badfics one author has made, though we&#39;d prefer not to antagonise anyone by making a list of &quot;badfic authors&quot; - it&#39;s rather rude, and there&#39;s nothing to say they can&#39;t improve later.<br><br>Trolls, on the other hand, you can report, if only so we can go and pick through their fanfics for anything mission-worthy.

            <p>I feel sorry for Russel in this, though. Everyone always forgets about him, and Murdoc didn&#39;t even bother to explain to the guys who he was. (In case you&#39;re wondering, he&#39;s the drummer, and he has several ghosts living in his head. Sadly the fanwriters don&#39;t seem to like him, apparently because he&#39;s a fat guy, or because he doesn&#39;t have as much HoYay with 2D - the cute one - as Murdoc does.)<br><br>I think I&#39;m gonna have to illustrate this. Undecided as to whether the pillowfight or Murdoc&#39;s expression upon the sudden appearance of the shotgun would be more fun :)</p>

            <p>Thus, I will not be volunteering to PPC it. And, while it&#39;s perhaps not all that bad compared to many other things, it&#39;s still pretty bad. I think it really started getting to me when one of them (don&#39;t remember which) started talking about doing a 69. That just sounds like 14 year old boys talking (though probably not to each other), and it completely cracked whatever willing suspension of disbelief I&#39;d had up until then. Oh, and of course the ex-girlfriend randomly popping in. Seems like a lot of people randomly pop into that house at the exact time the plot needs them to...<br><br>--anamia</p>

            <p>In and out of existence as well as the house. Jamie, Damon, Dennis Hopper, and Suzi are/were actual people (Dennis Hopper sadly passed away only a couple days back), but 2D and Murdoc are cartoon characters created by Jamie and Damon. Within the Gorillaz cartoon canon that&#39;s actually workable, as they occasionally demonstrate knowledge that they are cartoon characters. (Murdoc shrugged off murder charges after using a staged accident during the &quot;El Manana&quot; music video to kill a stalker of his because &quot;I&#39;m a cartoon, I don&#39;t even have fingerprints&quot;, and 2D claimed paternity suits from non-cartoon women don&#39;t stick because he doesn&#39;t have any DNA.) However, this fic was posted on a real-person-fic community, so, as you can see, I was a tad confused by the fact that nobody thought anything was odd about the cartoon characters wandering around. Also, even though they&#39;re &#39;toons, they can&#39;t shrug off car accidents and they don&#39;t normally have Malletspace.</p>

            <p>I have recently read this and I don&#39;t know why you think this is a badfic. It seems good, people liked it, and few of them reviewed it. In fact most of them are positive especially as of 10/10/11 (That&#39;s October 10th, 2011), and they requested to have more chapters. One of the reasons why this was up is because of the sexual talk of the Robot Masters about Roll in MegaMan Powered Up. Plus there is no proof of anything about &quot;robots&#39; sex and society taboos&quot;, in fact, most of them involve HUMANS AND ROBOTS TOGETHER! Especially what the parody of the three robotic laws called &quot;The three laws of robotic sexuality&quot; said:<br><br>First Law :<br>A robot may not have sexual intercourse with a HUMAN BEING without his/her agreement, or through inaction, allow this HUMAN BEING to indulge in solitary pleasure.<br><br>Second Law :<br>A robot may obey all the perverse desires of HUMAN BEINGS, except where such behavior would conflict with the FIRST Law.<br><br>Third Law :<br>A robot must protect its virginity as long as such protection does not conflict with the FIRST or SECOND Law.<br><br>The only thing we have as close as to a good explanation for ROBOT-ON-ROBOT sexuality is what Dr. Light said here below.<br><br>&quot;Incest, in our society, is considered immoral and is indeed illegal… but only to humans. In truth there are no cultural or societal laws that deny robots constructed by the same person to fall in love. This is primarily because there is no real precedent for it, as you two are the first to have true emotional capability (after Blues-san). In truth, many of the traditions that bind humans, as far as our social interactions, do not really apply to robots. Even though you consider yourselves brother and sister, the truth is that the only relation you have is your basic construction, which could be said of a normal, previously unrelated human couple. The fact that you were created by me has nothing to do with it because anyone with my schematics of one of you could have also created you and there might be no real difference. In the end, all that anyone should care about is that you two are happy and that&#39;s all there is to it.&quot;<br><br>And you know what, Dr. Light actually has a good point. The only thing is is that they&#39;re not BLOOD related, even when they&#39;re made by the same creator. Besides, it seemed unfair that other incarnations of Rockman/Megaman and Roll are not &quot;related&quot;, while the classic series does. Also, I know you think it can be repetitive of what&#39;s going on, but that sounded like a nitpick. Nitpicking is not a review. Anyways, I thought it would be interesting to see what happens next, but seeing that has been 4 years since, I wish the author would continue.<br><br>Anyways, that&#39;s all I have to say. Peace!</p>

            <p>Wow. Slap this one up on the &quot;unclaimed badfic&quot; list. I understand that maybe incest is just another &quot;not my kink&quot; issue, but this is badly-written incest.<br><br>BTW, reporting badfic can be done on an old badfic thread, if there&#39;s one on the front page, so as to avoid scrolling stuff off the front page.

            <p>I&#39;m looking for betas.  It&#39;s a fanfic, not a PPC mission, but it&#39;s a crossover, and my two main characters are a <i>very</i> not-main character and an OC, and I want to make sure they&#39;re not Mary Sues and that the crossover works.  Therefore I ask you guys for help.<br><br>The fic is about 10,000 words long.  It&#39;s mostly set on Barrayar, and the main characters are feline wizards.  Let&#39;s see... there&#39;s discussion of suicide, but that&#39;s the only real warning.<br><br>Ideally I&#39;d like to have two betas: one familiar with <i>Young Wizards</i> but not the <i>Vorkosigan Saga</i> and one familiar with the <i>Vorkosigan Saga</i> but not <i>Young Wizards</i>.  (They&#39;re small enough fandoms that I can&#39;t count on readers knowing both, so I want to make sure it&#39;s readable if you only know one.)  Anyone (or two) up for the job?<br><br>And to justify the existence of this post for people who clicked but don&#39;t want to beta, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=134U_fd8t64">here</a> is Lois McMaster Bujold reading the first part of <i>Cryoburn</i>, her <i>Vorkosigan Saga</i> book that comes out this fall.  Fans, listen.  Non-fans, listen anyway; you might get hooked.  (Seriously, if you like military/mystery/political/lots of other stuff sci-fi, her books are really enjoyable.  And she&#39;s won something like five Hugo Awards.  So getting people to read LMB&#39;s stuff is the other point of this post.)</p>

            <p>Bujold is an excellent writer.  If you want to see what the <i>Vorkosigan Saga</i> is like, one of her short stories can be read for free <a href="http://www.baen.com/library/1011250002/1011250002.htm">here.</a>  It&#39;s set on Barrayar and not as military sci-fi as most of the <i>Vorkosigan Saga</i> books, but it&#39;s good if you want a taste of what her writing is like.  I think it won a Hugo Award, and it&#39;s pretty Glarunging good.</p>

            <p>I think it is. The world is your basic future setting, with FTL travel available and genetic engineering commonplace; and the main character (in most of the books; some focus on secondary characters) is a guy who&#39;s basically nobility on his home world, but has a secret identity as a mercenary. The interesting part of it is that the implications of FTL travel, genetic engineering, cryonics, and all the other technologies they have are really thoroughly explored in relation to their impact on the culture and politics of the world. Some sci-fi series are basically just modern life transplanted to space; this one is more like a different world. So yeah, it&#39;s pretty good.</p>

            <p>Not sure what you mean, the Board looks more-or-less normal to me. <br><br>One thing, though, which you&#39;re probably not aware of: multiple posts in quick succession are frowned upon. The reason is that each new post pushes an older post off the other end of theBoard, there to linger in Internet obscurity.  So, if you have extra questions, you can ask them in a reply to your intro post, or you can report new badfic as a reply to an existing badfic report, rather than a new post of its own. <br><br>Trust me, people still do read slightly-older threads, so you don&#39;t have to be at the top of the Board to get noticed. <br><br>Welcome, by the way!<br><br>Elcalion</p>

            <p>I find the key to writing an accent is to say it is thick but write it as slight.  Keep it simple.  Pick a few things that set the accent apart from most other accents and use them.  The audience can either fill in the rest of ignore it all together.<br><br>Neshomeh, in an effort to make it easier to stay consistent, has devised a cheat sheet for Barid and Brightbeard&#39;s accent.  It is very helpful.</p>

            <p>I took a chance on the second chapter, and have wanted to headdesk at least twice. It&#39;s set during the episodes with the Weeping Angels, and Ms. Lakebed (Glod, what a name <i>that</i> is!) is an uberspeshul snowflake with, among other things, a connection to the Angels (her species/family/race? hunts them down and kills them), magical phasing powers, and the ability to cure Amy of turning into an Angel via a magical dreamcatcher. <br><br>Definitely a &#39;Sue, I should think, not to mention that there&#39;re various grammatical, spelling, and punctuation errors.</p>

            <p>As you may have seen, there&#39;s a thread below in which several of us have been discussing ideas for a new PPCish term. There are many badfics around which are brain-breakingly horrible, but not known by enough people (within our community, at least) to qualify them for Legendary Badfic status - after all, a thing can only really be <i>legendary</i> around here if most every board member (or agent) knows of it and shudders whenever a name such as &quot;C*l*br**n&quot; comes up. (I know, I know - don&#39;t kill me. *hides*)<br><br>Therefore, we would like to come up with a term for something that is a particularly <i>bad</i> badfic - something we can throw around in anger or frustration, because, let&#39;s face it, that&#39;s when it&#39;s most likely to be used. Here are the suggestions we have so far:<br><br>(from Tawaki:)<br>* Extremely Bad Fic<br><br>(from me:)<br>* <strike>GodAwful Badfic</strike> - eliminated because &quot;GodAwful Fan Fic&quot; is an existing website and we don&#39;t want to snitch.<br><br>(from Neshomeh:)<br>* Incredibly!Badfic<br>* Glaurunging Badfic<br>* Ewfic (not to be confused with Eufic)<br>* AUGHfic<br>* ODEfic (for Oh Dear Eru)<br>* HorriFic (complete with odd capital F)<br>* Horrorfic<br>* Abominable Badfic<br><br>(from anamia:)<br>* Bleepfic<br>* Painful Badfic<br><br><br>Personally, I support &quot;Glaurunging Badfic&quot;, &quot;AUGHfic&quot; and &quot;Bleepfic&quot;, because they&#39;re apt, fairly unique and fitting for the PPC, and roll well off the tongue.<br><br><br>I&#39;d like to call for any more suggestions you might have, as well as support for or (tactful!) criticism of existing ideas, so we can create a shortlist and then, in a few days, vote. If any of you have good reasons why we shouldn&#39;t pick a new term at all, please say so. </p>

            <p>Well, it looks like <i>Bleepfic</i> has won. Still, it&#39;s so close, it wouldn&#39;t be fair to snub any of the other terms, since they&#39;re so popular, so I&#39;ve made a new article at the wiki entitled <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Bleepfic">Bleepfic</a>, but all the major runners-up are mentioned there as well. Please, take a look and make any additions you like.

            <p>This is fun :)<br><br>Okay, we seem to have some clear favourites - the following have at least five votes each:<br>* Glaurunging Badfic<br>* AUGHfic<br>* Bleepfic<br><br>These have one vote each:<br>* Extremely Bad Fic<br>* Incredibly!Badfic<br>* Ewwfic<br>* ODEfic (for Oh Dear Eru)<br>* HorriFic <br>* Abominable Badfic<br><br>And these, which I&#39;d like you all to look at, just to be fair, have been suggested since my first post (I assume everyone&#39;s looked at them already, but still):<br>* SickFic<br>* Worsefic (which has two votes already)<br>* Crukfic<br>* MorphFic<br>* Blechfic<br>* Squickfic<br>* C*l-level<br><br>A few arguments have been made against some of the options:<br>* Squickfic - could be used already to describe fics that are intentionally written badly<br>* AUGHfic - is rather generic<br>* Glaurunging Badfic - relies on obscure LotR knowledge (who Glaurung is)<br>* Bleepfic - relies on PPC in-knowledge.<br><br><br>Going purely by numbers, we seem to have a three-way tie, so if you all don&#39;t mind, I&#39;d appreciate it if you&#39;d vote again for <i>one</i> of the following three:<br>* Glaurunging Badfic<br>* AUGHfic <br>* Bleepfic<br>- <i>or</i> throw your vote in favour of one of the new or so-far-not-favoured options listed above. <br><br>Please only vote once, as it&#39;s rather hard to keep an accurate tally when people give me three favourites, in ranking order. Remember, we can always use &#39;losing&#39; terms to refer to these fics anyway, just as long as we have one &#39;standard&#39; that will be the title of the wiki article, for example.

            <p>Just because we &#39;officially&#39; name them &quot;Bleepfics&quot; doesn&#39;t mean we can&#39;t use other terms for them as well - &quot;Worsefic&quot;, I imagine, is going to stay pretty common regardless of whether or not it makes a late break and wins the vote. I just wanted to get one &#39;standard&#39; term so we could name a wiki article with it, but there&#39;s no reason the first line of that article can&#39;t be something like, &quot;<i><b>Bleepfics</b>, also known as <b>worsefics</b>, <b>AUGHfics</b>, and many other such names, are...</i>&quot;<br><br>It&#39;s up to you. If you&#39;re writing a mission and your agents see &quot;Code C&quot; on the monitor, then whether they immediately translated it to &quot;bleepfic&quot; is a matter of your writing and their personalities. :)</p>

            <p>In order:<br><br>1. Abominable Badfic - &quot;abominable&quot; is a fun-to-say and underused word, and very apt without being too specific.<br><br>2. Glaurunging Badfic - very PPCish, but harder to say aloud.<br><br>3. Bleepfic - also very PPCish. I only worry that all other things Bleep are good things, so people might get confused and think it means fic that takes the pain of badfic away, or something.<br><br>I&#39;d like to take back &quot;horrorfic,&quot; because that could legitimately describe any fanfic, good or bad, in the horror genre.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I&#39;m not joking with the subject. You&#39;ll be surprised how much time you spend in and around HQ once you find a discussion that interests you. Also, I apologize for being late. I was away from my computer for the weekend, and am just now catching up. I would like to join the ranks of people who are praising your username. I, personally, only dream in impressions. Sure, they form pictures, but color is only rarely specified. And take a bladed yo-yo. It probably won&#39;t help you make friends, but it is a great way of taking your mind off of badfic.</p>

            <p>So I was looking for badfic on the List of Unclaimed Badfic the other day, and I came across this: <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2580283/1/bSaving_b_bConnor_b"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2580283/1/bSaving_b_bConnor_b">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2580283/1/bSaving_b_bConnor_b</a></a>. It&#39;s an AU story involving Harry&#39;s twin being the Boy Who Lived, and Harry being sorted into Slytherin. It starts out a little iffy, but, in my opinion, gets much better very quickly.<br><br>So, I was thinking about taking it off the list completely, but thought I should ask other people&#39;s opinions first. If you think it should stay, then I&#39;ll leave it alone and consider reconsidering my taste. -grins-<br><br>--anamia</p>

            <p>but I guess it&#39;s possible that whoever put the story on the unclaimed list had not read the whole thing. At least, I usually decide something is a Suefic based on the first chapter. And occasionally change my mind later on (although more often I decide not to do a mission because the brain breakage it hurts).<br><br>Not actually having read this fic I won&#39;t give an opinion on that. Just my opinion on Suefic in general. It is not the characteristics of a character or a plot that makes it a Suefic. Being the twin of Harry and the Boy-Who-Lived doesn&#39;t make Connor a Stu. It all depends on how the author handles it. Is Harry still in character (mind that having a twin who shared his abuse at the Dursley family could have changed him)? Are all the other characters still in character? If that&#39;s the case, this is not a Suefic and I think it can be taken of the list.<br><br>If I remember the first book correctly -- it&#39;s about ten years since I read it, so memory can be shaky on it -- the Sorting Hat originally wanted to sort Harry into Slytherin. It thought he would be great there. Harry had to beg it to be sorted into Gryffindor.</p>

            <p>And Connor is definitely not a Stu, at least not in my opinion.  Harry may be, but not Connor.<br><br>Personally, I think it&#39;s probably too good for the badfic list.</p>

            <p>True, but from what I read, James and Lily are still alive, Sirius was never accused of murdering all those people and thus sent to Azkaban, and therefore Harry and his twin weren&#39;t sent off to the Dursley&#39;s, so making him go into Slytherin when he&#39;s grown up in such a pro-Gryffindor environment just strikes me as odd. </p>

            <p>And, to be fair, Harry&#39;s traumatized by being Sorted into Slytherin, especially at first. <br><br>**Spoilers, for anyone who actually cares. -grins-**<br>Later, (like, in the retelling of PA), we learn that Harry really is the Boy-Who-Lived after all and that Voldemort transferred his powers etc. With that, it makes much more sense for him to be in Slytherin. Additionally, in the retelling of GoF, the author tells us a lot more about his childhood, and even Albus admits that it made him into a Slytherin. -shrugs- I know I shouldn&#39;t be defending it, since I did ask for your opinion, but I&#39;ve read a lot farther, and most of these things are explained.<br><br>--anamia</p>

            <p>Given that Connor is immediately recognizable (or at least, to me) as a Marty Stu, I think it should stay. Even though the Author gives an okayish reason behind it- saying it&#39;s AU and all- the whole having a scar shaped like a heart (And I immediately got this picture of it being shaped like the actual organ, and not the simplistic pictogram we all recognize as being a heart), as well as taking Harry&#39;s place as the Boy-Who-Lived-and-Will-Eventually-Defeat-the-Dark-Lord, reeks to me of Marty Stu-ness. <br><br>Also, I have a problem with Harry being Sorted into Slytherin. Given that both his parents were in Gryffindor, I would think that he&#39;d want to follow in his parents&#39; footsteps, and that the Sorting Hat would recognize that. Oh, and the fact that Draco and Harry can &quot;feel&quot; one another&#39;s magic? *cringes*</p>

            <p>The other stuff doesn&#39;t, really.<br><br>It wouldn&#39;t take too much of a difference in Harry&#39;s history to make him not want quite so strongly to be put into Gryffindor. All you&#39;d need to do is tweak his family history so that he has someone other than the Dursleys that he considers &quot;family&quot;, so that his parents fade into his past rather than being preserved in his mind as the only people who really loved him. Having a twin might change things to the point that Harry would care more about his living brother than about his long-dead parents, and not care so much about being in the same House as his folks.<br><br>But... well, heart-shaped scars? Taking Harry&#39;s place? Sorry, but no. That&#39;s blatant Stu. If you wanna do a decent AU fic about Harry having a twin, you should be focusing on Harry, not wedging your OC into the story sideways.</p>

            <p>Kit and I have decided that, what with the influx of anthro and pet characters needing medical treatment, Medical needs a division devoted specifically to them. My question is whether this Division would require a separate Head of Department, and if so, should they be human or plant or what?</p>

            <p>After all, the PPC isn&#39;t exactly known for having the most efficient and logical management, is it? <br><br>Just speaking personally, I think I&#39;d like it if the non-human (or non-human<i>oid</i>) patients could have a little division of their own, even if in practical reality it just gets caught up in general Medical anyway. And the idea of a non-human Head would be appropriate, too, either flora of fauna. (Do we have any anthro/animal Heads yet? I don&#39;t think so; unsure.)<br><br>Whoever it is, they should certainly be a doctor who already works in that area. EdW has a good point about the potential hillarity of a promoted Flower, though. </p>

            <p>*There&#39;s precedent in Medical for non-Flower department heads, of course. But wouldn&#39;t it be more of a &quot;division head&quot; than a department head? Or you could just call them &quot;wards&quot;, like in a hospital.<br><br>*Medical already handles at least a large minority of non-human patients--not just anthros and pets, but creatures with biology that&#39;s not even based on Earth-style biochemistry. One can assume they&#39;re pretty flexible that way.<br><br>*Doctors do tend to specialize; but when their overall field is already so broad, it may be that to them there&#39;s not all that much difference between two mammals--say, a cat and a human--when on the same day they may be treating a Taxxon or a velociraptor... or even more bizarre things, like energy creatures or two-dimensional beings.<br><br>I think thereneedn&#39;t necessarily be a specific division, though there could be. But there are almost certainly specialist doctors--doctors who specialize in humans (as they&#39;re the largest group), or doctors who specialize in unusual biologies, or doctors who specialize in specific problems like resurrecting canon characters or monitoring and managing the glitter levels of ex-Sue agents. And yeah, with all the anthro and pet characters--I think it&#39;s very likely that there exist one or more doctors who specialize in the biology of Earth and parallel-Earth animal and anthropomorphic animal characters.<br><br>If there are subdivisions in Medical, they could also be functional divisions: A ward for Agents; a ward for canon characters; a ward for contagious problems; a ward to isolate characters who, left to their own devices, would attempt to assimilate HQ or get glomped by every fangirl within a ten-mile radius; a ward for rescued mpreg babies to grow to full-term before being transferred to the nursery.</p>

            <p>But that&#39;s because that&#39;s how I set up FicPsych, which is similar to Medical and even shares personnel sometimes. But then, I guess that was because it made sense at the time, so it works. {= )<br><br>Anyway, I also agree that it makes more sense for the nurses in Medical to just have specialties rather than to be segregated into divisions. I think that the majority of canon characters and agents are human, so it doesn&#39;t make sense to have personnel sitting in divisions where they probably wouldn&#39;t have much to do most of the time. They would just get drafted into the general staff anyway, so they might as well be unsegregated in the first place.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I think this is a great idea; after all, there&#39;re some Agents that&#39;re were-creatures or other kinds of shapeshifters that don&#39;t always fall under the category of &quot;human&quot; 24/7, not to mention the anthros from Redwall and various other continua. This is good timing; one of my Agents that I&#39;ll be writing (hopefully, anyways) is a tri-morphic shapeshifter (humananthro lionessfull lioness), and tends to stay in anthro form unless she has to go into a Word World.</p>

            <p>If there&#39;s a veterinary division, would it make sense to have it handle all the &quot;weird biology&quot; cases?

            <p>Probobly it&#39;ll need a Head Doctor/Nurse/Healer/Thingimabob, though. But I don&#39;t think we have Division Heads unless the Divisions themselves are very large, and I&#39;m not sure we should allowed to pull Flowers into the PPC without any explanation of why they weren&#39;t there in the first place. Maybe a Flower could get promoted from a lower position, like a Janitor or that Daisy from the Fifth Anniversary. But on the other hand, he wouldn&#39;t really know how to head a Department...But on a random third hand, a newbie Department Head might be hilarious if written right. I can imagine it...It&#39;s trying to act all officious in front of the Agents, but it keeps forgetting things, and acting shy in front of the other Heads, and all the fangirlish Agents are trying so hard not to go &#39;squee&#39; all over him...And now I want to make up a new Department just so I that&#39;ll happen. And I do, and we start arguing, and suddenly there&#39;s a random Emergency that comes from it, and this makes Neshomeh explodes...somehow...I dunno.

            <p>I really like the idea of having a new, slightly shy, Head (Vet?) I&#39;d be happy to try to write one, but I don&#39;t know much about medical procedures, and I don&#39;t want to become overworked this early. If anyone is interested in writing this character (assuming the position is created), submit your application; don&#39;t worry about my tentative claim. Otherwise, I&#39;ll see what I can do. Anyway, I like the idea of splitting Medical into wards. It would allow the doctors greater specialization, but without the (almost) complete separation that Divisions would create. Personally, if I were a non-human agent, I&#39;d feel better about being treated by someone with experience in something other than the human body.</p>

            <p>As far as I can tell, the emergencies annoyed everybody because they basically sucked all the agents into them, forcing everybody to write serious or relatively-serious stuff instead of sporking badfic or writing funny fluff pieces. Not everybody likes that. But the people who were actually around for it will know more about why it ended up being annoying.<br><br>I&#39;ve read fics where people brought in more agents to help with particularly bad sues--stuff like having to exorcise all of Arda and giving cameos to a bunch of agents along the way; or bringing in a dozen agents to take out dino!Sues; or portaling invisible wildlife into the cafeteria and watching the hilarity. I think it&#39;d get kinda annoying if it was nothing but stalk-charge-kill/exorcise over and over; doesn&#39;t there have to be some variety? Besides, I like a good combat scene, especially if it involves creative strategy.<br><br>IMO, there&#39;s a difference between some good old chaos where you have to call in the backup, and having the Mirror Multiverse or the Factory Sues try to take over again. It&#39;s like monster-of-the-day versus apocalypse-of-the-month, and so long as it stays monster-of-the-day, it feels like it would fit right in, or at least to me it does.</p>

See, if you check out <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Year:2008">Year:2008</a>, you will note that we had the Macrovirus Epidemic and the death of Makes-Things in March, followed shortly by the Sue Invasion in April, followed by the Big Brother/Key to Canon thing in June, followed by the Silver Gate thing in November.

Because if you give a writer a crisis, s/he wants to write a bigger crisis. If you give an agent more power, the agent will tend to get even more power.

            <p>There&#39;s got to be more to it than that. I mean, if a possible apocalypse is all it takes to turn every single agent into a cliched action hero, then it&#39;d be near-impossible to write decent stories that involve real danger. And I&#39;ve read some of the stuff you linked to; it&#39;s not badly written, it&#39;s just as interesting as traditional mission reports, and it seems nowhere near what anyone here hates, if &quot;what we hate&quot; is indeed mary sues and bad writing. The only thing that makes sense to me about the whole thing is that there was too much of it in too quick succession; that, presumably, it would&#39;ve been fine to have Emergency-type events once or twice every couple of years, rather than constantly.</p>

            <p>Yes, if it had been once or twice every couple of years, or perhaps even if some of those things had centered around different agents, it would have been fine. But that&#39;s not how it was.<br><br>In addition to that, more and more new people were coming in going &quot;Hey, guys! I have this really awesome idea for an emergency!&quot; and &quot;What if my agent was this uber-species and had all these superpowers and big weapons?&quot;, and that didn&#39;t help, either. It would have turned into a one-up contest, which is not what we&#39;re here for. We put a moratorium on emergencies so people would be able to experience what we <i>normally</i> do.<br><br>I don&#39;t agree with your contention that &quot;no possible apocalypse stories&quot; = &quot;it is now impossible to write stories that involve real danger.&quot; There are plenty of ways to have real danger without threatening all of HQ/the multiverse. Again, we have no problem with things like Elcalion&#39;s bear, or Pads going into labor in the middle of a mission, or (I hope) my DIC agents nearly being killed because of some &#39;Sued Pernese dragons, or even Dafydd attempting to use a Sue artifact, getting blown to the Halls of Mandos, and getting dragged back (sans one hand) by his irate fiancee--mainly because it served him right and he suffered the consequences, and it was hilarious. Mainly we just don&#39;t want things that result in overpowered or overly dramatic agents, or leave the PPC incontrovertibly altered for everyone afterward.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>OK, so we&#39;re saying that &quot;legendary badfic&quot; means that it needs to have two qualifications: One, it&#39;s extremely, brain-breakingly bad; and two, it&#39;s very well-known, to the point that (for example) about 80% of the people in the given fandom have heard about it.<br><br>What about badfic that just has the &quot;extremely, brain-breakingly bad&quot; quality? This isn&#39;t your average everyday glittery Sue or improbable slash story; it&#39;s the kind that has people whacking their heads against the nearest hard object to try to get rid of the memory. But it&#39;s not well-known enough to make legendary badfic status. All of these would be taggable with &quot;NSFB&quot;, just like legendary badfic. Not necessarily NSFW (legolas by laura isn&#39;t NSFW, for example); but just the sort of vileness that makes you wish bleeprin were real.<br><br>I think we need a third category, beyond just &quot;badfic&quot; and &quot;legendary badfic&quot;--one that just requires that anyone who&#39;s read the thing agrees that it&#39;s legendary badfic quality, just without the notoriety.<br><br>Maybe &quot;Aspiring Legendary Badfic&quot; could be archived along with the other unclaimed/claimed badfic, and tagged with &quot;NSFB&quot;..</p>

            <p>I think using any of the &quot;NSF_&quot; tags could be misleading, given that they&#39;re meant as warnings for when you look at something, NSFB being the extreme form. As you say, not all legendary badfics are R+ rated. <br><br>&quot;Aspiring Legendary Badfic&quot; is... on the right track, but perhaps too easy to confuse with simple &quot;Legenday Badfic&quot;. I&#39;m not sure what else to suggest. In my other post I suggested &quot;Godawful Badfic&quot;, but that&#39;s sort of stealing from the Godawful FanFic website, which is rather rude.

            <p>I can&#39;t add my support. Personally I think the &quot;Legendary&quot; part of the title ought to imply that most everyone (here) knows of and will shudder at the memory of peeking at the damn thing, so I&#39;m very hesitant to add anything to that list. ...Maybe I&#39;ll suggest making a &quot;Goddamn AWFUL Badfic&quot; list for the stuff that doesn&#39;t quite make the &quot;legend&quot; part of &quot;Legendary&quot;...

            <p>I was looking at the Unclaimed Badfic page on the Wiki, and saw that there&#39;s a series of <i>The Great Mouse Detective</i> badfics. Would it be possible to pre-claim those fics, given that I don&#39;t have permission yet? <i>The Great Mouse Detective</i> is one of my most favorite Disney movies of all time, and I&#39;d greatly relish slaying the &#39;Sue that dares to mess with it. I&#39;m not asking for Permission to begin writing; I just want to know if I can reserve the right to claim these &#39;fics.</p>

            <p>So that&#39;s my question: Does the PPC, by critiquing bad fanfic, increase the (admittedly small) percentage of good fanfic?<br><br>I&#39;m pretty sure that it improves the quality of the people writing, just through practice. (I&#39;ve seen it reading the missions of people who&#39;ve written more than about a half-dozen of them--the writing tends to get better the more recent the mission.) And reading PPC mission reports from bad fanfic teaches you about what not to do in your own fanfiction--I got that effect back when I used to just read them, before I knew you could actually join. It&#39;s definitely a more interesting way to learn than reading a book about grammar or writing style.<br><br>But are these effects only on people who are going to improve anyway, because they care about the quality of their writing to the point that they&#39;d find a way with or without having example badly-written stories sporked for them? Or do they actually reach people who don&#39;t care, and convince them to start caring?<br><br>The main point is to have fun, of course. But it&#39;d be nice if there were some effect, at least on the borderline cases where people just hadn&#39;t learned enough to write well yet.<br><br>Which brings me to a second question, of course: Is there a way to maximize the chance that people will learn from your writing--while minimizing the chance that they will simply be offended and think you&#39;re an awfully evil person for writing a bunch of words that fictionally kills off some other person&#39;s bunch of words because they&#39;re smothering Legolas in mountains of Sue glitter?</p>

            <p>After all, that&#39;s how I improved - by reading OFUs and PPC missions. I reckon we could actually make some people care about improving their writing, but not everyone. Everyone but the people who think any sort of negative review is a flame, even concrit. There&#39;s not much that can be done in that situation.</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve noticed, when reading PPC missions, that sometimes the agents will just point out an error offhand, scribble it down on the charge list, and speak to each other in effective shorthand, which is fun and easy but won&#39;t really help confused and not-so-good-yet writers understand why. On the other hand, sometimes the writer of the mission swill make an effort to have the agents explain the problem/error as well as possible solutions (without being so obvious as to &#39;turn to the audience&#39; and talk directly; it still has to be in character for the agents&#39; dialogue), which can indeed be very helpful, and is far more direct, without being a preachy speech.<br><br>As for your first question - I&#39;d say it depends entirely on who does the reading. I was already a nitpicky fanatic before I found the PPC, and I don&#39;t personally know anyone who&#39;s read it and then begun a crusade to save fanfic, but I don&#39;t see why it <i>can&#39;t</i> convince people to care, only that I haven&#39;t seen it myself.</p>

            <p>I think that the PPC does serve a quite valuable purpose. It shows what&#39;s wrong with certain stories- SPAG issues, Mary Sues, etc- and then, most importantly, <i>tells you how to fix it</i>. I know I have a few badfics in my past (I started out doing HP fanfic, but have never returned to it, thank Glod), but a few things helped me get better at writing. One was taking a creative writing class Senior year of High School, but the other was finding people who consistently wrote goodfic (bitemetechie is a primary example of this; she&#39;s a genius at it). The PPC helps spread the fact that there are, in fact, goodfics out there, since the missions themselves are (hopefully) meant to be such things.<br><br>As for the second question, I think it&#39;s honestly how the person reading the missions takes the intent (having fun and spreading goodfic)and what they do with what they learn: Mary Sues are bad, good grammar is non-negotiable, etc. <br><br>I know I&#39;m just rambling here. Take it as you will.<br><br>Pretzel</p>

            <p>I for one, agree with the first bit. My writing has improved dramatically since I first joined this, and it&#39;s extremely noticeable. I look back at my earlier work and it seems like it&#39;s been written by an entirely different person.<br><br>Maybe it&#39;s because I started caring. I first started writing stories and the like simply because my overactive imagination demanded it, but now that I&#39;ve begun to care, actually put effort into what I put down... Wanted what I put down in the words to be more vivid, more tangible...<br><br>Anyways. The people who don&#39;t want to change most likely won&#39;t. It&#39;s possible for someone who doesn&#39;t care about their writing to start caring, but don&#39;t expect it to happen to everyone, okay? I know for one that some people enjoy writing terribly, and others think that writing well isn&#39;t worth the effort. That&#39;s obviously wrong, because it&#39;s absolutely thrilling to see your work be appreciated when you actually put lots of effort into it.<br><br>As for your other question, I can see where you&#39;re coming from here. But sometimes, it&#39;s not worth cushioning the blows. If you try to soften your opinion on someone else&#39;s writing, it might lose the meaning you were trying to get across. Though it may seem harsh, it is sometimes necessary to tell the flat out truth as opposed to a sugar-coated lie.<br><br>...I smiled at the last sentence. XD</p>

            <p>PPCing has made me very much aware of all the things to look out for to write goodfic. I haven&#39;t written much other than missions for a few years now, but that&#39;s because my main failing is a good plot. I never have enough ideas to get me past the first chapter.<br><br>Anyway, that&#39;s me. I&#39;ve receive comments from people that my missions encourage them to go back to their own stories and fix that problem I had just made them aware of. The people that make these comments, I think, are already pretty aware of what makes goodfic. I take it as a compliment that they also learn from me.<br><br>I&#39;ve heard from a few people whose fic I &quot;targeted&quot; that, in retrospect, they appreciate the comments I made.<br><br>I recently had a discussion with someone that does not think PPCing is the right way to get people to write beter stories. She suggested rather than publicly point out all the bad in a story, I should write in essay an PM the Suethor. I doubt that is going to make the Suethor any more likely to use my advice. Plus, it&#39;s less fun for me to write.<br><br>I don&#39;t think there is a way to maximize the chance that people will learn something from my writing. Or rather, I don&#39;t know if it is possible to improve that chance from what it is now.</p>

            <p>So, we all remember how much we loved &#39;Don&#39;t Panic&#39;, the fanfic that took a cliche storyline and made it good? Well, for those of you who are into Animaniacs, I found a fic that&#39;s pretty much Animaniacs&#39; answer to Wicked. While hunting for badfic, no less.<br><br>At first glance, it seems like your run of the mill, Pin-the-tragic-backstory-on-the-canon-character fanfic, but it&#39;s not. It manages to take that overused plotline and prove to the fans that it can be pulled off WELL. I was kind of jaded at first when I got to the part with the abusive parents, but I was pleasantly surprised.<br><br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3703685/1/Family"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3703685/1/Family">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3703685/1/Family</a></a><br><br>What I like about this fic is that the characters are all fleshed out. And I mean ALL of them; even the aforementioned abusive parents. They&#39;re not just mindless, screaming dummies whose only purpose is to pound it into the readers&#39; heads that the main characters&#39; lives are horrible and we should feel sorry for them and wrap them in blankets and cuddle them. They feel like real people who would actually exist in the real world. Even one of the most despicable characters in the fic is portrayed as an actual person, and not like... like Uncle Vernon in &quot;A Sad Story&quot;.<br><br>Another thing I like about it is the fact that the author managed to change the canon to suit her purposes, without actually changing anything, if that makes any sense at all. It&#39;s a good read, and you don&#39;t really have to know anything about Animaniacs to understand what&#39;s going on; knowledge of the canon just makes it marginally more fun.<br><br>It&#39;s waaaay darker than the canon, without a doubt. But then, so was Wicked. The difference here is that this fic is less complicated. It&#39;s very well thought out, and the only thing I might complain about it is that it&#39;s really, really long, and it&#39;s still unfinished. I haven&#39;t even gotten to the latest chapter yet.<br><br>All in all, even though it seems deceptively cliche near the beginning, it&#39;s not. It&#39;s well worth the read.<br><br>There&#39;s even a Blazing Saddles reference at one point. Blink and you&#39;ll miss it!</p>

            <p>I have also found an epic goodfic. Actually, it was referred to me ages ago by Bronwyn, and she may have told you about it, but oh well. I&#39;ll link to it again.<br><br>It&#39;s a massive Harry Potter AU which <i>actually works</i>. It starts out a little shakily, and the main character has faint whiffs of &#39;Sueishness about her, but it gets better very quickly until she&#39;s in no way &#39;Sued or in danger of becoming &#39;Sued. <br><br>The story itself tells a completely different version of the stories beginning when Harry is two. I won&#39;t say too much so as not to give it away, but I will warn that it&#39;s <i>very</i> long, and that there are two completed sequels and another in progress.<br><br>I&#39;d love to know what you think of it!<br>--anamia<br>p.s.

            <p>I only have one more question now. It&#39;s about time I asked this one, because it&#39;s been bugging me ever since I first joined this. Before anyone asks, I&#39;m not trying to offend anyone with this, I&#39;m just stating how I understand things.<br><br>Why are there all these rather dark, sinister things and implications concealed behind a mask of silly and funny if I&#39;m not allowed to explore them? Are you all willingly ignoring it, or am I the one at fault here, letting it drag me down and cloud how I see the PPC?<br><br>Take, for instance, the missions themselves. Every single day, perhaps less, agents are forced to commit horrible acts, mercilessly killing just to stay alive. The exorcists fare better on the morality scale due to not killing nearly as much, but there&#39;s still the fact that both are only treating the symptoms and not the problem itself (I&#39;ll let you interpret that line yourselves).<br><br>And that&#39;s not even getting on an individual level. Think, just for a moment, how <i>utterly terrifying</i> it would be to actually be an agent. First of all, you yourself would probably have little combat experience, be not exactly the most fit physically, and would rather be off doing something else. Training is basically being handed a weapon, and being told to try not to die. Your partner or partners, if they aren&#39;t as scared  as you are, will probably be highly erratic, completely incapable of cheering you up due to lack of sympathy, and insane to boot. <br><br>So, let&#39;s say you get that far without breaking down into a gibbering wreck of what was once a perfectly normal person, and you&#39;re about to go on your first mission with (Insert partner&#39;s name here). If you&#39;re potentially lucky enough to get someone who has former experience in the work, you&#39;ll probably get instructed on how to use the technology, but if not, <i>too bad for you</i>, it&#39;ll be a goddarned miracle for you to even get halfway through the mission, yet alone complete it. Don&#39;t even think about free time afterwords, either, because the Ironic Over-Power is sure to smite you!<br><br>Now. Let&#39;s say you&#39;ve completed several missions, have got the hang of it and made friends with your partner. If you&#39;ve made it this far, congratulations! You&#39;re now completely out of your mind, if not dead already! If you somehow manage to reach retirement, nobody&#39;s going to accept you back home, or anywhere for that matter, they&#39;ll think you&#39;re absolutely nuts. At this point, <i>you might as well be the PPC&#39;s property, a tool for them to use and nothing more</i>. For all they care, you&#39;re just going to keep doing your job in the name of a faceless goal that doesn&#39;t even seem to go anywhere. For all you know, it&#39;s just to amuse the higher-ups in some kind of sadistic show for them.<br><br>Oh, and before you say that I&#39;m taking things too seriously, I haven&#39;t laughed once at anything PPC related. If it&#39;s so funny, where&#39;s the jokes? where&#39;s the hilarity and silliness that is so integral to the PPC&#39;s spirit? Am I blind to it? Do I sympathize with fictional characters far too much to see it?<br><br>Because all I see is this descent into madness and subsequent death/locking up, and there&#39;s nothing funny about that... I feel like I&#39;m missing out on something...</p>

Make missions dramatic, rather than funny. It could be really good to be original. I mean, we pride ourselves on our originality; it would be hypocritical to smother yours. I dunno.

            <p>The PPC is a pardoy; it always has been. Parodies never take things this too seriously. We waver a bit here and there, sometimes giving our missions as different tang, but the essence of the morality issue is - as has been said - that the Sues and other such characters (bits, wraiths, et cetera) are not people and never have been. They&#39;re characters, and if it were ethically wrong to kill a character, then there would be no such thing as entertainment drama. <br><br>As for why we make light of &#39;dark and sinister&#39; issues in the frist place - it&#39;ss probably the same reason that people make jokes about serial killers and dead animals, or why many fanfic writers get a kick out of writing about their favourite characters being tortured - or both. There seems to be some fascination with taking something serious and making light of it; black humour. The story of Sweeney Todd is about an insane serial killer, but you don&#39;t see the critics condemning it as morally correupt, do you? <br><br>There&#39;s also the point that the PPC was born of frustration with badly written stories we can do nothing about. How often, in daily life, do you head people say &quot;Oh, I&#39;m going to kill you&quot;, or &quot;This is killing me&quot;? They don&#39;t mean it literally, byt Jay and Acacia connected the notions into a silly idea and ran with it. Then we picked it up and ran with it again, and again. For fun. <br><br>Also, from an in-world perspective, the agents aren&#39;t exactly real people; they don&#39;t react quite the same way as we in the real world do. That&#39;s just the nature of the stories, because it wouldn&#39;t <i>be</i> a parody if our protagonists took things seriously.<br><br>Does that answer your question?</p>

            <p>heheheh... You know things have went full circle once people start taking obvious parodies seriously with little reason to!<br><br>Kind of stupid to even bring the question up.

Even if my mind is screaming at me to stop. If I have to suffer in the name of my own art, <i>fine</i>, I&#39;ll share the pain that my characters will inevitably experience. Nothing&#39;s going to stop me from writing, as I enjoy doing it (most of the time, anyways), even when it just seems wrong for me to continue.<br><br>I&#39;d say more right now, but I&#39;m staving off sleep to an unnatural extreme. Better get to bed.<br></p>

            <p>It&#39;s one thing not to share our sense of humor, but if you&#39;re really as torn up about all this as you make it sound, I suggest in all seriousness and with all respect that you seek professional help--not because you&#39;re different from us, not because we don&#39;t agree, but because, to my mind, it is just not healthy to feel so bad about things that aren&#39;t real. It especially worries me that you think you have to stay here and do what we do even though you keep saying how uncomfortable it makes you feel. There is no good reason for that. I feel like there has to be something else going on in your life, and as much as we&#39;d like to make you feel better, we really can&#39;t help as long as your troubles are deeper than simply not getting the jokes.<br><br>Please consider it.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Not to say it isn&#39;t possible, but from everything I&#39;ve seen of Max through his posts, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s all that serious. To be frank - and I hope you don&#39;t take offence at this, Max - I&#39;m more strongly reminded of myself ten years ago, when I felt I had to do things I wasn&#39;t comfortable with just because other people seemed to have no problem with - in my case, playing sports and wearing makeup. I don&#39;t think &#39;realness&#39; is the issue; I think it&#39;s more that Max is forcing himself to do something that he just doesn&#39;t enjoy, because he thinks he &#39;should&#39; enjoy it.<br><br>I could, of course, be completely wrong. I don&#39;t know anything more about Max as a person or his life except what I see on this board. The only reason I&#39;m writing this post is because I read yours and my first thought was, &quot;oh, please don&#39;t let that make him panic&quot;, because if I&#39;m right, that would only make things worse.<br><br>No offense, Neshomeh.

            <p>On the other hand, I don&#39;t think trying to fit in at the expense of one&#39;s happiness is healthy, either.<br><br>My take on this is based on my experience seeing what happens when a person tries to make someone or something else responsible for his or her well-being, and it&#39;s not pretty. I don&#39;t want any of us, including Max, to be in that situation. Like I said, we can only do so much to be supportive and helpful if there <i>is</i> a serious issue.

            <p>First off, as others have said, if it is bothering you <i>that much</i> to write Missions... don&#39;t write Missions! It&#39;s okay! We will think no less of you if you never produce a single assassination, Max. (At least, I hope not, &#39;cause if so, I am officially the PPC&#39;s Hated Outcast<sup>TM</sup>.)<br><br>You feel like this, if &quot;this&quot; is pained and worried and really like you&#39;re a bad person for hurting written characters as we do, because, as people have said, you&#39;re taking it too seriously. But that&#39;s not the only reason. When we write characters, we put a bit of ourselves into their creation. I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve noticed that you&#39;ve got little ghosts of your characters in your head by now, here and there. We understand them, they become real to us. And we don&#39;t want to hurt them, most of the time.<br><br>Example! I used to play a Tortall-based roleplay called Steelsings, with a young, amateurish rogue named Lirond, who one day made a terrible mistake and got into trouble with the Rogue, who decided to cast him out and, in the process, slit his tongue down the middle. I was lucky in that it wasn&#39;t me writing the damage, &#39;twas someone else&#39;s character. But for all that? It <i>hurt</i>. I nearly cried. Because once they root themselves into your head, they don&#39;t want to go away.<br><br>But as far back as fiction goes, writers write bad things happening to their characters-- to create a story worth reading, for drama, and for development. <s>I won&#39;t go into the philosophical tangent of pain being necessary for development. As mentioned in chat, you should read Brave New World, among others.</s> <br><br>Mark Twain said, in his <a href="http://www.mamohanraj.com/Writing/twain.html">Rules of Writing</a>:<br><br>...okay, so the exact quote isn&#39;t on there. Something about you have to hurt your characters to make them worth it. To make them grow, to show that they <i>are</i> good, worthwhile, strong characters, you have to put them through a wringer-- and they&#39;ll come out the other side looking like good, strong, worthwhile characters. <br><br>If you&#39;re feeling guilty about hurting other people&#39;s characters, well. <s>I honestly don&#39;t understand how we can freak out about the moral dissonance of killing &#39;Sues while at the same time brushing off the idea of hurting Suethors&#39; feelings.</s> Again, if you never write a PPC Mission, <i>that&#39;s okay</i>. No one&#39;s forcing you to write parody, and if you hate it that much, don&#39;t worry about it. But I do highly recommend that you start trying to -read- parody (and others!) as often and as much as you can, and that might help you understand this community, both writing-wise and community-wise. (Again, if you can&#39;t find ANY books at your library or school, start looking through <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/wiki/Main_Page">Project Gutenberg</a>.)<br><br>Good luck, Max.</p>

            <p>That&#39;s why. If the reader doesn&#39;t care about any of the characters, either it&#39;s bad writing or the reader&#39;s currently being forced to do a book report on the work.<br><br>So you can&#39;t just say &quot;it&#39;s all words&quot;, even if it&#39;s just a parody. You have to make your characters sympathetic. It doesn&#39;t take angst; just little things. Maybe one of your agents is allergic to Middle Earth pollen. Maybe the exhaustion of overwork is starting to tell and somebody made a stupid mistake. Maybe the technology is starting to go wonky (okay, that&#39;s not a &quot;maybe&quot;; it&#39;s just a &quot;when&quot;).<br><br>RL ethics are different from the ethics of the characters. It wouldn&#39;t be wrong if I created a totally sociopathic serial killer who liked to kick puppies and eat babies. It would, however, be totally wrong in-world. So, while I won&#39;t feel bad about killing off a sue, my agent might, because to him/her it might be too close to killing off a sentient being. (As we&#39;ve already discussed, the lack of characterization means a sue actually isn&#39;t sentient; she&#39;s closer to a chatbot than a human.)<br><br>The interesting thing I&#39;ve noticed with agents is that they take themselves and each other relatively seriously; but the authors don&#39;t take them seriously. That makes sense; it&#39;s a parody. But it doesn&#39;t stop the agents from considering themselves real. If they didn&#39;t, we probably wouldn&#39;t care what happened to them.<br><br>The only difference between agents and &quot;real people&quot; is that the rules of their worlds work differently. In their world, they&#39;re real people; but in their world, real people can be created simply by writing about them.</p>

            <p>Your moral compass isn&#39;t broken - far from it. There&#39;s nothing wrong with you; you&#39;re just in a crowd of people who happen to not be like you. For all we know, <i>we</i> could be the minority. Simply put, Max, if you don&#39;t feel comfortable writing PPC parodies, then don&#39;t write them. Why torture yourself? There are many, many things you could write other than PPC missions, and life is too short to &#39;suffer through&#39; <i>anything</i> if you don&#39;t have to.

            <p>Your Mileage May Vary on this answer, but I feel that while yes, there are some rather dark elements lurking in the shadows, as it were, of the stories, there&#39;s also the fact that without those elements there wouldn&#39;t be any engaging stories. Take any of Terry Pratchett&#39;s works, for example. They are widely known for their humor and satirical natures, but there&#39;s also an underlying current of darkness there as well. In <i>Witches Abroad</i>, for example, there&#39;re the ever-familiar elements of fairy tales (<i>Cinderella</i>, <i>The Frog Prince</i>, etc) written into the story, but there&#39;s also the underlying theme of how ultimate and unlimited power corrupts people, as well as the danger of twisting stories to suit one&#39;s needs.<br><br>That, as a matter of fact, is ultimately what the PPC is here to prevent: the twisting of beloved stories and/or fictional universes so beyond the norm that they&#39;re unrecognizable. Imagine if someone with the power to change everything you hold dear into an unrecognizable and warped reflection of itself came to your world (town, city, whatever), and began changing things. How would you react, especially if you knew you had the power to stop this soulless being from ever doing it again? Yes, you would have to resort to assassination, but if you&#39;re doing it for the greater good of your world, wouldn&#39;t that be at least some justification for the act itself?<br><br>I guess what I&#39;m trying to say here is that while yes, there are some things about the PPC that aren&#39;t pretty out in the light of day, it&#39;s essentially just a way to enjoy oneself and have fun gently poking fun at the bad stories in this world. I for one get a kick out of it, but I suppose it&#39;s because I&#39;m just weird like that.<br><br>Oh, and if you want to see an organization like the PPC- they kill Mary Sues <i>and</i> plot bunnies (the evil ones, mind you)- go check out Bitemetechie&#39;s Anti-Plot Bunny Association stories. <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2998389/1/">Here&#39;s</a> a link to the first in the series; they&#39;re funny as hell, though the series is on a bit of a hiatus at the moment.<br><br>Enjoy, and I hope that helps some.<br><br>Pretzel</p>

            <p>1) Sues are not people. That&#39;s really integral to what makes it funny. Sues and their companions the bit-characters are not sentient, thinking beings in any way that we understand them. To drag in theology, they don&#39;t have souls. That&#39;s the key thing, really.<br><br>2) Agents are not conscripts. Most agents, especially agents from World One, <i> chose </i> this. And like it.<br><br>3) In terms of everything against you - very true. But on the other hand, the Word World is protecting you on a mission. That does a lot.<br><br>4) Despite all the &quot;no retirement EVER&quot; jokes... retirement is totally possible. And you can go home again. Look at Boarder!Laburnum&#39;s characters. I could be misinterpreting but it seems to me that Foxglove stays in contact with her family all the time; Agent!Laburnum was re-establishing contact with her family. And if you don&#39;t want to go home, you have ever piece of fiction ever created to escape to. Look at Acacia from the original series, isn&#39;t she off happy in some Roman continuum? If a really desperate agent wanted, they could go settle in the Hundred Acre Wood or Mr. Roger&#39;s Neighborhood. Horrendous fate!<br><br>5. It is possible to live a happy, if incredibly bizarre, life at HQ. I&#39;m gonna cite Pads&#39;s and Trojie&#39;s <a href="http://rc45.dreamwidth.org/35591.html"> Ten Years Hence </a> here - in that future, at least, they&#39;re living in HQ and have a, uhm, nontraditional, but very happy family that they could never have had anywhere else. Life is nice.<br><br>6. As to funny... I don&#39;t know. There is, in fact, an element of black comedy here. I&#39;m curious as to what you read, and why you kept reading if you didn&#39;t think it was funny or enjoyable. I&#39;m curious as to why Things I Am Not Allowed To Do At The PPC, Agent Lux being Lux, and spontaneous water fights aren&#39;t funny. I guess this is kind of a matter of perspective, though, and a personal thing.<br><br>(My apologies if I misrepresented anyone&#39;s work, by the way.)</p>

            <p>... though Laburnum has to do it secretly because she&#39;s still on the Missing Persons list and there&#39;s still a warrant out for her arrest. The PPC is probably a better option for her than anything waiting for her in World One, even if she&#39;s the way she is entirely because of her own choices. She chose to get Bloodwrath, though she didn&#39;t know it would stick in World One. A hair-triggered berserker really couldn&#39;t operate in normal society. In the PPC, she can direct it to a useful function.<br><br>Even S&amp;S kind of like the job, even if they did technically get press-ganged. As someone pointed out on the TVTropes page, Stormsong may have ostentatiously attempted suicide, but if he genuinely wanted to die he has enough medical knowledge to have been able to do it.</p>

            <p>And, as a former writer of angst myself, I can understand where you&#39;re coming from. (I say former because I&#39;ve become lazy in recent times and don&#39;t have the mental energy to devote to writing proper, realistic angst.) Angst is fun. At least, I consider it fun. Then again, I am a fairly twisted writer who likes to see her characters suffer, but that&#39;s a different story.<br><br>On the other hand, I think all the craziness is just a coping method. Yes, being an agent, especially a newbie, would be terrifying. Not only to have to go into a badfic (scary in itself), but to have to dispose of a person (who may not be a &#39;person,&#39; as such, but dangit, when you&#39;re looking at her, I expect she might feel like one, at least a little), and to have to do so with a complete stranger is scary. (And yes, I rate the last as the scariest. I have a... warped value scale. Yay for being antisocial...) There are two ways to cope with that kind of thing: you crack, at which point you&#39;re taken to FicPsych and probably sent home, or you take it all as absurd but necessary. It&#39;s those who take the second track who stay as agents and actually do all the work.<br><br>I say this, of course, even as I&#39;m sitting here wondering if my characters are reacting enough to the horrors of the &#39;fic in which they are currently stuck. Angst is a hard habit to break. -grins-<br><br>So yeah, I understand where you&#39;re coming from, and I sympathize with you. I find PPC stuff funny, but I also see the darker side, and I want to work with that. As people said, you need a balance, and all silliness is just as bad as all angst. <br><br>--anamia</p>

            <p>You see what you want to see in a work of fiction. Much like the stereotypical monster in the closet, what is reasonable and prudent to one person is most definitely not believable to another. I think that at least in the most part, your perspective differs from mine enough that the implications you see and the ones I do are definitely two different things.<br><br>Take, for instance, the missions themselves. It has been stated (in TOS) that we can&#39;t hurt badfic authors, as they have rights. This implies that their creations do not have rights, and thus are not alive - therefore, ending them isn&#39;t as horrible an act as it might seem. They&#39;re just words, after all, and we&#39;re re-writing them to be something else. (Namely, not continuing to distort the canon.)<br><br>A lot of the PPC&#39;s humor comes from the workplace - management that seems out of tune with reality itself, to say nothing of the employees, is a classical example.<br><br>The Ironic Overpower is another entity borrowed from the workplace, especially customer service positions. I do A/V for money, as I&#39;m sure many of you know. Now, the vast majority of my events run smoothly, professionally, and so on. It&#39;s the ones that don&#39;t run smoothly that would make it onto my blog if I felt like blogging, and especially the ones where multiple things fail for humorous effect. For example, the event this morning. I was scheduled to start (and did start) an hour and a half before an event to set up a single mic for a presenter. When the presenter arrived, they didn&#39;t even notice that the mic existed, stood in front of the stage, and talked to the people unamplified. Meh, big deal. However, the thing that has me shaking my fist at the Ironic Overpower is the fact that I started at 6 AM on a Saturday.<br><br>The Ironic Overpower is not a force that keeps Agents busy all the time - it&#39;s a semi-anthropomorphization of the odd way that when things go wrong, there tend to be multiple things that go wrong, and all at the best possible time to make things entertaining and amusing. I suppose I could sit down and do the statistics and work out how often it actually happens, but in my work, at least, it seems to happen far more than it should. (Then again, the times it does are the ones people tend to remember.)<br><br>And no, I do not believe that it would be terrifying to be an Agent. We&#39;re going on adventures in far-off and magical places to save the world - not dramatically, not through magic speshul powers, but by stabbing words in the face. Are big-game hunters terrified by what they hunt? <br><br>As far as not being able to go home, see Pads&#39;s missions - she goes into that a lot more than I ever have.<br><br>As with any storytelling, the PPC stories are exaggerations for comic effect. There was quite a bit more to training here where I work than &quot;here&#39;s a sound board, go run the state Supreme Court&quot;, but that&#39;s what it seems like at times, and if I was telling it for humorous effect, that&#39;s exactly how I&#39;d tell it.<br><br>No, the PPC isn&#39;t a descent into madness. For every potential trauma-inducing moment, there are hours of running around in Middle-Earth, seeing the scenery, laughing at people&#39;s stupidity, and so on. No, it&#39;s not a safe office job, but the ancient chinese proverb that &quot;may your life be interesting&quot; is a curse is complete and utter bunk. The PPC is an adventure.<br><br>Also, from a very machinistic perspective, we don&#39;t write Lovecraftian spiral-into-madness fics because we don&#39;t want to read them. This is fiction. We tell the stories we want to tell, and that is not where we want the PPC to go. We want to read about a flake with a camera and a slightly bloodthirsty card-game aficionado saving Middle-Earth one badfic at a time. We want to read about hospital drama where the patients could be from any world imaginable. We want fun and adventures and completely ridiculous superheroes saving the multiverse, so that&#39;s what we write. </p>

            <p>I mean, we all see the PPC slightly differently. You say missions aren&#39;t terrifying; I think they often would be--really, why wouldn&#39;t you be terrified if your partner just got eaten, or if you had a pack of Warrior!Sues running at you with intent to turn you into a bloody smear on the ground?<br><br>Not constantly terrifying, I&#39;ll grant you that. Not even usually terrifying. More like, hours of boredom, then thirty seconds of running/fighting/whatever for your life. And yeah, getting to see the world you love probably makes up for it.<br><br>Writers bring their own ideas into it, though. If you&#39;re the sort of person who would hate to have to kill a rabid dog and have bad dreams about it afterward, then you&#39;re the sort of person who&#39;ll probably write about an agent learning to deal with the fact that they&#39;ve got to kill the sue to protect the continuum. If you&#39;re the sort of person who&#39;s dealt with craziness in your own life, then maybe you&#39;ll write about how the agents deal with it. If you just want a fluffy humor piece, then you&#39;ll write that.<br><br>It&#39;s just that if we were to take it entirely seriously and write about nothing but the angsty side of things, it&#39;d get simultaneously boring and ridiculous. I&#39;ve not written any PPC spinoffs, but I&#39;ve written other fanfiction, and I&#39;ve made the mistake of going too far into the &quot;downer&quot; part of things. It simply didn&#39;t work. It wasn&#39;t realistic. Human beings, or non-human beings written by human authors, simply don&#39;t live all day every day wallowing in angst. There are better times, and there are worse times; and if you write nothing but badness, it&#39;ll become cheap and boring. Write about characters who realistically have good times and bad times and everything in between, and it can be good.<br><br>The kind of person who chooses to work at the PPC is almost always a highly resilient individual. Resilience, basically, is the capacity to deal with the crazy in your own life and sometimes in your own head and go on with your life regardless. In the PPC, you&#39;d have to be that way just to accept the craziness of the fact that the multiverse exists. You&#39;d have to be flexible; you&#39;d have to be able to see the ridiculousness of life and just laugh at it. People who don&#39;t have that capacity simply wouldn&#39;t stay there past the first plothole.</p>

            <p>I second everything Calista said and so am not going to repeat it, but would just like to add in addition . . .<br><br>One important thing to remember is that, for the most part (with rare exceptions such as in Suedom) Mary Sues aren&#39;t real people.  Not even in fiction.  I mean, a well-designed 3D character in a story might be construed as &quot;real&quot; within the context of a story, but Mary Sues are one-dimensional (at most) wish fulfilments.  They are, in other words, soulless.  The is no more evil in killing them than in killing a pencil drawing of a stick figure.<br><br>One last thing: people adapt.  I mean, people adapt all the time, swiftly, and necessarily to new situations.  They are changed, but seldom broken.  While reading your question-thing, I tried to put myself in the place of my agent, and my reaction was:<br><br>At first, it would be difficult, but I&#39;d adapt.  And it wouldn&#39;t drive me insane.  It wouldn&#39;t be fun, but it would be necessary.  And I could do it, if I had to.  To protect worlds and lives, I could do it.<br><br></p>

            <p>Killing &#39;Sues isn&#39;t a matter of &quot;let&#39;s be bloodthirsty because we&#39;re sociopathic.&quot; (Well, mostly it isn&#39;t. Some agents are a bit... okay, a lot... sociopathic.) It&#39;s more like the lesser of two evils: If the Sue is allowed to stay in the continuum, she will literally destroy the continuum, along with all the characters living in it. Recruiting a full-blown Sue is also out: Since the PPC itself is a continuum, a Mary Sue in the PPC may not just begin to unravel HQ, but will have access to almost every continuum out there. The implications are obvious--take them out or the multiverse dies.<br><br>What happens if Sues get free rein: <a href="http://nath-ppc.livejournal.com/544.html"><a href="http://nath-ppc.livejournal.com/544.html">http://nath-ppc.livejournal.com/544.html</a></a><br><br>Most Sues employ mind control and brainwashing to control canon characters, so it&#39;s not like they&#39;re innocent. They&#39;re more like the personification of canon distortion than anything else, though they&#39;re sometimes portrayed as being a little like a viral infection (think zombies or vampires), as they can occasionally turn non-Sues into Sues by sheer influence.<br><br>Some PPC fics have explored the reality of having to kill Sues. Not every agent is a gung-ho &#39;Sue killer.<br><br>Kitty Callahan, for example, only managed to kill the Sue in question because her partner was in danger: <a href="http://wizkit.livejournal.com/524.html"><a href="http://wizkit.livejournal.com/524.html">http://wizkit.livejournal.com/524.html</a></a><br><br>And from the perspective of the &#39;Sues: <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Suedom"><a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Suedom">http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Suedom</a></a><br><br>Yes. It is terrifying to be a PPC agent. Why do you think they develop such a sarcastic sense of humor? For the most part, though, it&#39;s only about as terrifying as being a soldier going to war (which is extremely terrifying, but something that people do every day, so you can&#39;t say it&#39;s unrealistic)--and done for about the same reason: Love of canon worlds. Hating to see them torn apart.<br><br>Almost universally, PPC agents are volunteers. They&#39;re hardly paid, so it&#39;s not like there&#39;s economic pressure to stay; they could probably, if they liked, just stay in the next continuum they were sent to visit. Overwhelmingly, they&#39;ve made the choice to risk it, take their average life/sanity expectancy of one year, and actually make a difference.<br><br>Think about it: If all this were real; if all the books and movies you loved were real worlds; if there were billions and trillions of sentient creatures that needed protecting from the reality-warping powers of what might as well be eldritch abominations in the shape of ridiculously beautiful teenage girls--well, would it really be so highly illogical to set out to risk it and make a year&#39;s worth of difference? In general--and as weird as it sounds--PPC agents are probably happy with their jobs, when they aren&#39;t shoveling down Bleepka or fighting for their lives.<br><br>The Flowers do have an ulterior motive. It&#39;s called &quot;stopping the multiverse from turning inside out and becoming utterly uninhabitable&quot;. It&#39;s a matter of common goals: The Flowers want to have a habitable universe; the PPC agents want to protect their favorite worlds. When you have a common goal, you might as well team up.<br><br>Um, and yes. You are taking things way too seriously. The PPC is meant to be humor. It has a dark side; but the dark side, I think, makes the humor all the better. If you&#39;ve got a near-100% chance of going nuts or dying, it makes quite a lot of sense to say screw it and laugh in the face of everything you encounter. It&#39;s just a matter of perspective. Once you know your days are numbered, you set out to enjoy every second--including the crazy hilarity of things like fangirls who accidentally cause Legolas&#39;s eyeballs to acquire sentience of their own and fly around the room...<br><br>Your idea is that if you&#39;re in a bad situation, the only logical response is to go angst and say &quot;Oh, woe is me! All is lost!&quot;... but why? It&#39;s just as logical to acknowledge that your bad situation sucks, and either set out to solve the problem, or else make the best possible life you can regardless.<br><br>We&#39;re all in the same situation, you know. We&#39;re all going to die, and some of us will go nuts beforehand, temporarily or for good. Whether it&#39;s a matter of one year or seventy, that&#39;s the universal human problem. How we deal with it can define our lives... But I&#39;m getting existential. Let&#39;s go back to herding Mini-Balrogs and exorcising badslash demons, shall we?</p>

Correct me if I made mistakes.<br><br>-Guns: I&#39;m sure they have guns but all of aren&#39;t lethal like real life ones.

            <p>You&#39;ll have to &quot;hack&quot; the world in which the fic takes place to do it, but thankfully, there&#39;s a way for agents to do it: Describe the badly-described scenery to re-form it the way you want.<br><a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Poor_description"><a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Poor_description">http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Poor_description</a></a><br><br>This isn&#39;t altogether safe, because all of the laws of irony tend to apply; but it can be done and has been used (though I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s been used as an execution method). Canon tends to help you because it wants to be rid of the sue/stu as much as you want to kill them.<br><br>Ever had a lucid dream? I think it must be a lot like that. You know you&#39;re dreaming; so you can create things and events just by expecting they&#39;ll be there and imagining them vividly enough. Only sometimes, it doesn&#39;t work well; or you can&#39;t keep the details in your mind; or you can&#39;t control things entirely because your attention wanders or you&#39;re subconsciously expecting something else to happen. (If you&#39;ve not had a lucid dream, or not learned how to control them, chances are you sleep too deeply, you lucky bum, and don&#39;t get woken up every time the air conditioning switches on...)</p>

            <p>Why not just use the <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Embryo_Extraction_Kit">Embryo Extraction Kit</a>? It&#39;s already there in PPC canon, so why go looking for what&#39;s essentially redundant tech?<br><br>Quoting from the <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/MPreg">MPreg page</a> on the Wiki:<br><br>&quot;Sadly, fangirls who believe it&#39;s &quot;cute&quot; to have Jack Sparrow impregnated by Legolas will write what they will, and if there&#39;s nothing that logic and common sense can do to stop them, then our chances are slim to nil. <br><br>Fortunately, the Department of Sufficiently Advanced Technology has come up with a remedy for such an event: the Embryo Extraction Kit. This resembles the de-bugger used in The Matrix, but hooks up to a life-supporting receptacle, depositing the embryo into a friendlier environment than some poor canonical&#39;s intestinal tract. Since the child of Jack Sparrow and Legolas could never exist in canon, the fetuses are under the care of Medical Department until birth, after which they are placed in Canon Nursery School. &quot;<br><br>So technically (Well, if I&#39;m reading this right), you could use an artificial womb-like structure to transfer the embryo to, and therefore not have to worry about involving a surrogate mother. </p>

            <p>It&#39;s lolariously good--and proves that Harry Potter can never have a normal vacation like every other wizard/witch/person on planet earth. It also reminds me of a movie I saw once, but can&#39;t, for the life of me, remember.<br><a href="05c%3Fuser_id=16.html"> Make A Wish</a> is the story of a non-canon vacation that Harry took after the fifth book, when he decided to <i>live</i> just once before he had to face down Voldemort. In the process of his vacation he <i><b>**Spoiler Alert**</b></i> discovers a Crumpl-horned Snorkac in Holland, defeats several Death Eater Squads, destroys a bit of private property, confuses the hell out of every magical European law enforcement agency, and develops an incredible following among the aforementioned law enforcement agents.  And he has no idea that he&#39;s done so.<br>Umm, I do apologize for making a new post, but I didn&#39;t spot a goodfic report on this page.  Oh, and the only complaint I have about the story is that the formatting and some of the punctuation makes it a bit annoying to read.  But it&#39;s still a good read, all the same.<br>-Honu_Wahine</p>
