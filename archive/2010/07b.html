            <p>LotR is a fairly high-level reading, too, so you&#39;d think they&#39;d have a decent grasp of how writing works.<br><br>On the other hand, their grammar/spelling skills have no bearing on their actual ability to /write/, keep people in character, or any of the many, many factors that create goodfic.<br><br>For bizarre pairings, that tops the list, although I think the Harry/Basilisk is a close second.

            <p>As per the title of the thread, Hello there. I&#39;m 118, or, as I go on the IRC, S-118. Yes, its a Halo-ish nick, being based on the obvious SPARTAN-117 of Halo. Nevertheless, its my primary online nick. <br><br>Lets see...how I came to be here right now... Well, it all happened after Data Junkie commented on a page there, which resulted in me asking Maslab where Data Junkie came from, eventually redirecting me to here. And so ends the mystery of how I got here.<br><br>Anyway, thats it for my introduction of sorts. =P</p>

It&#39;s a stupid ...ing excuse to shove in the author&#39;s pet character down the reader&#39;s throat, I swear.  There were no indicators that Face had any problems, and they would have shown up at some point in the movie or the show if it were going to be a character trait.  Really, don&#39;t these people pay...  Never mind.  (Besides that, if Face had a problem with his serotonin levels, he&#39;d probably tell the team, or at least Hannibal, or eat a ton of turkey....wait...that would make sense, wouldn&#39;t it?)<br><br>-Honu_Wahine</p>

            <p>You know how, in some time-travel stories, someone will create a stable time loop in which Event One causes Event Two, which causes Event One?

Your agent returns from a mission.<br>2. He writes a mission report to turn in to the Flowers.<br>3. Because he&#39;s an Author, the mission report causes the mission to occur the way that it did.<br><br>Your agent would probably be quite unaware of the process.

            <p>That just gave me an idea. Yes, yes, yes. This can work. I&#39;m not going to write it all out yet, but maybe if you become part of the PPC, you can&#39;t write about the ppc or ofum, and so that&#39;s part of the recruitment. So, unless it&#39;s actual canon fanfiction, and not fanon fanfiction, you&#39;d have to stop being an in-between-worlds continuum Author.<br><br>However, your idea might and might not work- step one would have to happen before step two, and step two only affects step one when step one happens first... complicated.

            <p>We always try to answer questions, but no one can do so within two minutes of you posting the first time. ;)<br><br>And to be honest, I&#39;m not sure. There are definitely agents who once wrote fanfic, and agents who are aware that they themselves are being written, but I don&#39;t think any agent would take the risk of messing with the already-fragile fabric of reality in HQ. Besides, if it worked, they would essentially have the power to write whatever they wanted to happen happening - that being anything from a payrise to tyrannical rule over the Flowers - and if not, they&#39;d likely be caught by the fellow agents they&#39;re writing about and possibly end up in Medical as a result; so says the Laws of Irony and Rule of Funny. I can&#39;t see how the former would work out without toeing the line we&#39;ve tried hard to draw about keeping agents from being to speshul. The latter, on the other hand, could be funny.<br><br>But as it seems you&#39;re talking about a character who once wrote PPC fics and then joins the PPC... Hmm, maybe. I&#39;m sure some of the agents around this character would be wary, maybe even blame her (him?) for the daily suffering of their work, but it&#39;s still rather tricky.<br><br>Personally, I wouldn&#39;t do it, but I won&#39;t say outright that you can. What I will say is that - as you are, self-admittedly, a newbie - you should probably put this idea to the side for now and start by writing more normal agents. If you finish three or four missions like that and still feel it would be a good idea (and, of course, if the other PGs and oldbies on the board don&#39;t ask you not to), then you can consider writing in your new, former-PPC-fic-writer agent and see if it works. But please don&#39;t ask Permission with this character; it&#39;s too soon, and too tricky an issue. </p>

<li>Minis on missions: Generally, no--because it puts agents in danger of owning a CAF, which is a Sue trait and thus not smart for agents to do. Some agents do bring ordinary pets on missions; and sometimes minis discovered on a mission go along for the ride.<br><br>5. Young Wizards minis: Mini-BEMs would be cool, and has a better ring to it than Mini-Lone Powers. Mini-Eds (the shark from &quot;Deep Wizardry&quot;) are another option. In general, powerful monsters from a continuum serve as Minis; but the main antagonist does not (which is why we have mini-Balrogs, not mini-Saurons; and mini-Aragogs, not mini-Voldemorts). But if you want it to be the Lone Power, then go for it. It&#39;s not like it&#39;s so far out of the norm.<br><br>Minis generally have about the intelligence of a very smart dog or an average chimpanzee--animal intelligence, but smart animals. Some minis are sentient, but most aren&#39;t. Mini-Aragogs are notable for being able to talk (most minis can&#39;t.)<br><br>Agents&#39; lives:<br>4. Time away from HQ: It&#39;s unstable. Sometimes, agents are away for months and return within a day; sometimes they&#39;re away for five days and return in five days. Sometimes no time has passed at all. In general, their time away is kept short on the HQ end of the portal. It&#39;s been mentioned that Agent Jay would have been dead of old age if she had spent as much time in World One as she did on missions; so it seems that agents tend to age at the rate that HQ time passes (or even World One time, which can be shorter), rather than at the rate they spend time in missions.</li>

            <p>Minis:<br><br>1. Nope. Sorry.<br><br>2. Probably just sit around and eat - or set fire to things, depending on their temperament. <br><br>3. There are a few options: <br>You can go to an Adoption Centre (that is, the webpage where whomever is keeping the relevant list has posted all known names), select a misspelling that appeals to you and send an email with your adoption request. <br>If there is no list being kept for that fandom (which is sadly frequent), you can adopt directly from a Board post in which someone lists all the new minis they&#39;ve found.<br>If you find the misspelling in a fic you are PPCing, you can also adopt directly, though it&#39;s polite to make sure that no one else has already adopted that particular mini.<br><br>4. Honestly, I&#39;m not sure. These things change, and if someone fades out, it&#39;s not always clear if they&#39;re still considered to be in charge or not. I think Cassie was involved at some point, but I can&#39;t recall. <br><br>5. According to <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Minis">the Minis page on the wiki</a>, that hasn&#39;t been specified yet, so if you are the first person to write a mission in that continuum that stumbles across a mini, you can decide. If you&#39;re asking for an opinion, I&#39;m afraid I don&#39;t know the fandom. <br><br><br>Agents:<br><br>1. What is this &quot;vacation&quot; you speak of?<br>Actually yes, it has happened - Jay and Acacia took a trip to OFUM, so strictly speaking I don&#39;t believe there&#39;s a reason they <i>can&#39;t</i>, just that it&#39;s very unlikely. There was a recent interlude where a very young agent went home to see her family, but how she escaped the constant <b>BEEP!</b>ing and the wrath of the Flowers, I don&#39;t know.<br><br>2. Assuming that they want to... it would probably be more like a holiday as extras, but recall what the Sunflower Offical said in the Original Series - there&#39;s a <i>lot</i> of paperwork involved, which would probably make it more trouble than it&#39;s worth, in the end. As for families, that depends on the details of the fic they came from, and if the agents who recruited them weren&#39;t forced to kill said family for Sueishness or other such crimes. If they were &#39;family&#39; to a canon character, definitely not.<br><br>3. If they exist at all, probably not. Remember that the PPC doesn&#39;t exactly advertise itself everywhere it can. <br><br>4. Time is insane in HQ, and portals - which, as far as I understand temporal mechanics, act as time machines as much as moving-through-continua devices - can deposit you just about anywhere. The problem of too much or too little time passing in &quot;the outside world&quot; is unlikely to be a problem - at least, not in comparison to the actual fuss of paperwork required to leave HQ. </p>

            <p>Minis:<br>1. Nope. Really. And... what good would an ordinary pet be on a mission?<br>2. Same thing your cat/dog/hamster does all day while you&#39;re at school/work, I imagine.<br>3. Preferably, yes. Also preferably, there&#39;s a list somewhere to tell you whether the one you want is taken already or not.<br>4. Yep: Meir Brin. And, Cassie is maintaining the mini-Balrog list.<br>5. Personally, I would think mini-Lone Powers. I realize the potential problems with this, but, well... <a href="http://semiramis.deviantart.com/art/chibified-7036018">yeah.</a> Who can resist that? ^_^;<br><br>Agents:<br>1. Occasionally home visits are made. Cassie and Lycaenion recently posted an interlude involving such a one.<br><br>2. In the sense that they can visit their home continuum, yes, but in most cases there&#39;s really nothing left to go home to, since the remnants of the badfic that spawned them would vanish with the conclusion of the mission. If they have family, chances are they accompanied them to HQ (see Ithalond and his wife Mithiriel).<br><br>3. Depends, but usually no. Most people&#39;s parents wouldn&#39;t believe it, or if they did, they wouldn&#39;t condone it. Many people just tell their parents they&#39;re doing some kind of job abroad; others have used school as a cover; still others have said nothing at all and been presumed missing.<br><br>4. Again, depends--however, HQ doesn&#39;t work like Narnia. If you age in HQ, you&#39;ve aged when you go back where you came from. ... I suppose you could use a disguise generator to hide the effects, but people are still likely to notice any changes in personality you&#39;ve experienced.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

<li>For company and distraction.  Though it would have to be small enough for the agent to carry it around so it wouldn&#39;t get lost or (shudder) mess up the mission or (extra-shudder) mess with canons.<br><br>4. A better question: where do they keep their lists?<br>5. I considered it.  But they would be too scary.  They&#39;d have to have some power, being a mini Power, right?  And that&#39;s not good.  Also, would they look different for every person who sees them?  And aren&#39;t minis not fully sentient?</li>

<li>That&#39;s what partners are for.<br><br>4. Dunno. You should ask them. Cassie&#39;s e-mail is listed on her wiki user page (or you can page her on the Board), and I suspect Meir Brin can be reached via PM on her ff.net account.<br><br>5. Not necessarily. The way I figure, it would be like Mike&#39;s situation when It had taken the form of a parrot: definitely an aspect of a Power, but limited to the capabilities of Its mortal form. I imagine a mini-LP to be like a shoulder devil. It can whisper things in your ear, and it might bite you or give you a nasty little kick on the shin, but not much actual power beyond the ability to hover over your shoulder. Maybe lightning (read: static shock). Among other things, seeing the LP stuck that way, many times over, would be <i>hilarious</i>.<br><br>I can&#39;t claim this as my idea, though. Really it&#39;s all <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/1487734/1/On_the_bCare_b_and_bKeeping_b_of_Shoulder_Angels">this fic</a>&#39;s fault.<br><br>Theoretically I guess they would look different to everyone, but since we never see the LP&#39;s human form looking other than how Nita sees It... I take that with a grain of salt. I mean, it wouldn&#39;t be that hard to throw in a line for Kit to describe what he sees, but unless my memory is failing me utterly and beyond recall, that&#39;s never happened.<br><br>As for sentience, all minis can certainly understand human speech to some degree, and some (notably mini-Aragogs) can speak human language. In my opinion, they have a child-like intelligence: enough to understand and follow directions, but also enough to make up their own minds when it suits them. The exact level of intelligence varies from mini to mini, of course.<br><br>~Neshomeh</li>

            <p>Minis<br><br>1. Ordinary (and not so ordinary) pets can go on missions. I refer you to Absinthe from Trojie&#39;s missions.<br><br>2. Agents Miah and Cali&#39;s minis (and pet) spend most of their time finding new ways to disassemble PPC technology and tinker it into something else like a holodeck furniture generator thing.  And also in making messes. I think it just varies writer to writer.<br><br>3. I think the mini has to be on an official list.<br><br>4. If those aren&#39;t defined yet, and you are the first one to write them, you get to pick.<br><br><br>Agents<br><br>1. Sometimes they do, there was an interlude released a few weeks ago, which dealt with an agent visiting home. I can&#39;t seem to find it listed on Current events right now or I&#39;d link you to it.<br><br>2. I suppose it would depend on the particular agent, but I don&#39;t think so. Most of them recruited from fanfic were recruited from badfic that has been killed. Once it is killed it&#39;s not there to be gone back to, and most of them wouldn&#39;t want to try to visit a Sue infested place anyway. I know Agent Kelok sure wouldn&#39;t want to. Out of my agents, none are from World One, and half are confirmed to have no family.<br><br>3. I think a few do. According to the wiki, Foxglove not only maintains contact with her family, but also told them about the PPC, but I think this is probably very rare.<br><br>4. Again, possibly might depend on the particular agent. Time is not a normal thing in HQ. I&#39;d say that time actually moves faster in World One than it does in HQ for a lot of agents. A lot of agents are still somewhere between 2006 and 2008 HQ time. When agents go on missions, even if months pass in the fic, they don&#39;t come back to starved minis and pets, which would say that they weren&#39;t actually gone all that long. It&#39;s one of those things kind of like getting from one place to another. It doesn&#39;t go in a straight line, and it isn&#39;t the same from day to day.<br><br></p>

            <p>Heh. I had fun with the <i>Grow your own garden gnome!!</i>, since I figured that PPC agents probably tend to get some... interesting mail at times.<br><br>Ian&#39;s by far the more laid back and personable of the two, but Lee&#39;s got her moments.

            <p>Agents:<br><br>Name: Summerblaze (Summer)<br>Species: Human<br>Home Continuum: Valdemar<br>Department: Department of Mary-Sues<br>Background: The offspring of a Sue and a Darkwind!Possession-Stu, Summer was created with virtually no personality, and pretty much ignored except for sicky-sweet bits of fluff. The PPC interrupted the fic when she was about five years old, but not having any charges on her except for parentage, they took her back to the PPC Nursery (after a jaunt through the science center, where they attempted therapy to remove as much Glitter as possible). She was &quot;adopted&quot; by another Tayledras agent, and essentially grew up in the PPC HQ. Due to her parentage, she has a mild case of MSS, but not quite as bad as a full-blown Rehabilitated!Sue.<br>Skills: Mind-to-mind communication with her bondbird, mental shielding, (momentary) physical shielding, small fireballs<br>Weapons: Tayledras climbing pick; longbow<br>Appearance: Her parents may have been Suvians, but the author at least paid attention to genetics. Her hair is black (at certain times of the month it becomes &quot;glossy, raven locks&quot; and/or &quot;onyx tresses&quot;) and waist-length; on missions, she generally ties it into a pony-tail or braid. Her skin is golden-brown, the laws of Narrative Comedy having been lenient for once, as even in canon the Tayledras are simply described as &quot;golden-skinned.&quot; She is fairly tall and athletic, although without Suvian influences her figure is about as average as it gets. She is perfectly fine with this, and wouldn&#39;t have it any other way.<br><br>Name: James Ochre Yellow (Jamie, Oke)<br>Species: Human (Ex-Piper&#39;s Child)<br>Home Continuum: Keys to the Kingdoms (The Lower House)<br>Department: DoM-S<br>Background: A Piper&#39;s Child of unknown ancestry, Jaime was running from an Overseer after stealing a pair of wings when he fell into HQ. No one&#39;s really sure how; it was put down to a plothole. An accident with a Mage!Sue caused the wings (he&#39;d worked /hard/ to steal those. He wasn&#39;t just gonna leave &#39;em in a closet) to attach themselves permanently to his back, which, while occasionally convenient, can also be incredibly annoying, as they have a mind of their own and tend to snap out at inopportune times. (The process of turning a magical construct into a pair of flesh-and-blood appendages was also excruciatingly painful.)<br>Skills: Flight<br>Weapons: Whatever heavy object is nearest; decent hand at just about everything, but not particularly good at any one thing.<br>Appearance: James is quite clearly of mixed blood. His longish hair is sandy brown and usually messy; occasionally he ties it into a stubby ponytail when it starts to get in the way. His eyes are medium brown, and his skin is tan; in short, his coloring is what one might expect of a European, but his build is more like the stereotypical Asian, and his almond-shaped eyes and nonexistent epicanthic fold only emphasize the look. He is a rather mature-looking fifteen, easily mistaken for a college student.<br><br>Writing sample:<br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/u/1648576/"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/u/1648576/">http://www.fanfiction.net/u/1648576/</a></a> My page in the Pit, although it&#39;s mostly serious stuff, and since I haven&#39;t posted there in ages my writing style&#39;s changed. I&#39;m working on a sample with these two, but I figure as of now, might as well post what I&#39;ve got, eh?<br><br>First badfic: <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6094334/1/The_Life_of_Rosanna_Hathaway_Potter"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6094334/1/The_Life_of_Rosanna_Hathaway_Potter">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6094334/1/The_Life_of_Rosanna_Hathaway_Potter</a></a> I don&#39;t normally read this fandom, but it&#39;s such a god-awful frightfest that I couldn&#39;t resist.

            <p>But how on Earth could he be part Asian?  Unless... Did the Piper bring a lot of children to the House, not just the ones from the famous story?  Still, half Asian from that period would be very rare.<br>(I&#39;m not a PG, of course.)</p>

            <p>There was some Asian influence in Britain at some point. I just forget when it was ^.^; Also, he&#39;s not necessarily half Asian--Asian traits tend to be dominant in mixed-race offspring. (I didn&#39;t figure out an exact ratio.) Also, there is the throwback principle--<br><br>I&#39;m rambling. I think I&#39;ll stop before I wind up giving a lecture on genetics. Ehehe ^.^ Sorry, it just interests me...<br><br>And given the number of Piper&#39;s Children in the House, I sort of assumed that he must have--after all, there were a <i>lot</i> in the Great Maze, not to mention the ones working in other parts of the house.

            <p>I forgot to put this in my original post...<br><br>What I was basically trying to imply was that he&#39;s mixed, and nobody really knows what his ancestry is (except his parents, and they&#39;re dust). I would have invoked some African traits, but I couldn&#39;t think of how to do that without getting way more stereotypical than I&#39;d&#39;ve liked to.<br><br>Also, I have no idea what time period the Piper&#39;s Children are actually supposed to be from, and since I&#39;ve been assuming that they came through in multiple batches, it&#39;s entirely possible that he&#39;s from a time when Sino-European trade was going on, thus giving him an excuse to have an Asian mother and European father.</p>

            <p>*cattleprods self onto center stage*<br><br>Ahem... hi. I&#39;m Aster Corbett and I have been watching this board and PPC activities for a short while. I highly doubt anyone here knows me, but I guess that&#39;s ok. LONG WINDED INTRODUCTION, GO.<br><br>I&#39;ve been writing fanfiction for a pretty long time. Since I was maybe 12 or so and YES I went through the Mary Sue phase. And a hell of a lot of self-inserts, which I sometimes still do for the lulz but rarely publish. I get a sick raise out of torturing myself by writing a not-at-all-fun romp through fandom and making the point that any self-insert would be screwed any way fandom was sliced. But I try and put the past behind me when I write, nowadays. <br><br>I came out the other side of the Sue Phase after longer than I would have liked. I had a somewhat rough time of it because I was unfortunately raised by sneaky parents determined to raise a Cool Offspring and didn&#39;t tell their kid that being able to ride a horse and hit things with a lance was not in the normal 15 year old girl skillset. Which looks pretty silly to the older, wiser (?) me of the present.<br><br>So Mary Sues, when I learned to tell them from non-Sues, bother me greatly and I&#39;ve had to deal with them for at least a few years. I even made some independant hits and went on crusade against a few myself, writing satire and pulling other such shenanigans. I guess this makes me a goofy vigilante-type character who goes about buisness all wrong like a dingus.<br><br>I met Keily Shinra a little while ago, maybe a year or so, and I didn&#39;t know she was into the PPC. Then one day she mentioned it in a post she made elsewhere. I became curious, found the wiki, and with my sponge-like capability for Wiki Walk info sucking absorbed the general concept.<br><br>THERE WAS A WHOLE ORGANIZATION ABOUT ANTI-BADFIC. HOLY HAM ON RYE.<br><br>And so here I am, making an uncomfortably long and telling intro post that most are likely to TL;DR. I like video games, books, selected movies, so I suppose my fandom range is pretty broad. I won&#39;t list the fullness of my fandoms-- that would make this post EVEN LONGER. Which is way too long.<br><br>Sometime I probably will write a long, epic spin-off or something, likely in collaboration with Agent Shinra. Because that is just how I roll.<br><br>Have I mentioned I like Ganondorf? Mm, yes. Let me extend this awfully long post by mentioning that I like writing fanfiction about gerudo sorcerer-warlords and implimenting a bucking of the woeful lack of characterization Nintendo gives to its baddies.<br><br>Mm, Gerudo beefcake. &gt;___&gt;</p>

            <p>I don&#39;t know whether I got permission by lack of further complaints or if everyone just forgot about me, so I&#39;ll try again with a few changes.  I&#39;m still not going to actually write for a while, but I&#39;d like permission.<br><br>My agents are in Improbable AU, Star Wars Division. I&#39;m going to claim RC 808 for them.<br><br>Name: Kath<br><br>Species: Half elf, half human<br><br>Home continuum: Star Wars<br><br>Bio: Kath was a Mary Sue (based on one of my old characters, though you won’t find the story written down anywhere) in a story by an eleven-year-old (semi-fic blip). She somehow got from Earth to the midst of Episodes V/VI and messed a bit with canon, mostly by rescuing Luke, though there was no actual romance involved. She was recruited and had some basic retraining.<br><br>Powers/abilities/weapons: Weak Force power, some pyrotechnic abilities, very good fighter for no reason (her author said she taught herself), moderately good lightsaber user (despite having had no training, but to be fair, Luke had a ridiculously small amount), still has her lightsaber from her story.<br><br>Personality/preferences/quirks: Is annoyingly cheerful, will laugh at anything, is permanently energetic despite being an insomniac, is very extroverted, hates spiders, is claustrophobic, has a terror of being a Mary Sue, is a slight pyromaniac. Is fairly ignorant about the Real World because knowledge of it was not written into her fic and retraining didn’t cover it.<br><br>Name: Elena<br><br>Species: Human<br><br>Home continuum: Real World<br><br>Bio: Elena wrote relatively good Star Wars and Young Wizards fanfiction for a while, then wrote a Star Wars-Young Wizards crossover and got sent to the Star Wars Fanfiction Academy.  She somehow managed to survive long enough to graduate and receive a mini-Rancor named Anikin. She went into PPCing Improbable AUs for Young Wizards. Most of her job was getting rid of AU romance stories and original fiction and other miscellanea that was labeled as Young Wizards fanfiction by ignorant authors. (The latter more or less had to be entirely destroyed to keep them from trying to push their way into the YW continuum.) She finished her work of getting rid of the backlog of fics needing PPCing, so she was reassigned to Star Wars, though if another YW fic comes in, she might be required to do it.<br><br>Powers/abilities/weapons: Can speak the Speech of Wizards to a small extent, though I haven&#39;t figured out whether this can or should be used in Star Wars; probably not.  Uses a blaster and various explosives.<br><br>Personality/preferences/quirks: Talks a lot, regularly drops TV tropes into everyday conversation, enjoys blowing stuff up. Loathes movie adaptions of books.<br><br>My writing sample:<br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3209952/1/The_Last_Laugh"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3209952/1/The_Last_Laugh">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3209952/1/The_Last_Laugh</a></a><br>Though anything I posted there will do besides the Wizard&#39;s Manual, which you wouldn&#39;t like. (I&#39;m considering PPCing it for being a wild and crazy crossover.)<br><br>As for badfic, if this gets updated, I will use it:<br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6033861/1/Whispers"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6033861/1/Whispers">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6033861/1/Whispers</a></a><br>Mustafar.

I don&#39;t know enough about Clone Wars era Star Wars to handle the first three in the series.<br><br>This is the first in the series.<br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2757381/1/world_Guardians_the_warrior"> World Guardians the warrior </a></p>

            <p>I&#39;d really like to, but only on the condition that you don&#39;t give me a time that I have to do it by.  There&#39;s a lot for me to deal with at the moment and I&#39;m not sure when I&#39;ll have had enough time to write a few missions.  This can&#39;t be my first or even second because my agents have to get used to each other and I have to get used to writing it.<br>If you don&#39;t mind waiting 2-3 months, then that&#39;s great.</p>

            <p>I figure that someone has to be good at doing something besides making things explode if they might be dealing with unfriendly OOC and Author-Posessed canons who have lightsabers and the Force.  Anyway, it could be worse.  She could be one of those Sues with huge Force powers.  I&#39;m pretty sure that would have been taken away.<br><br>The reason I said I need that one to be updated is that it hasn&#39;t *clearly* messed up the story yet.  Sure, it makes no sense, and I can see that it&#39;s about to change everything, but I want to make sure I can find enough AU charges.<br>The second, while it doesn&#39;t last long, is concentrated horribleness.  Elena would probably consume her whole store of Bleeprin, knowing her.<br><br>I expect Elena to use the Speech to talk to objects from HQ or to do what she needs to in YW.  I had originally had the idea that it would help her talk to SW aliens, but I don&#39;t think that&#39;s acceptable.  (I could have her try and get in trouble for mixing continua.)  I figure it would go over much better in Lord of the Rings, where language is powerful, but she won&#39;t be going there.  No, she isn&#39;t a wizard (though she really wishes she were).  She just studied it.</p>

            <p>I just wanted to make sure; if they don&#39;t update, you may want to look around for another one, but that&#39;s up to you. As for the second one, my only concern was that it might be too short for your agents to properly &#39;stretch their legs&#39;, so to speak, but that&#39;s entirely up to you. <br><br>No worries about the Speech, either.

            <p>Just been thinking about this myself with my current mission.<br><br>The basic strategy seems to be never to play to their strengths. Don&#39;t try to fight a Warrior!Sue, or cast spells at a Witch!Sue--get sneaky, distract them, use the technology, get the canon to help you. The canon, as you know, hates &#39;Sues; and if she&#39;s stronger than your agent, but weaker than some canonical danger, then just charge her (while running away if necessary), then open a portal right under her feet to the location in question and let the canon squish her for you. Beautiful irony.<br><br>&#39;Nother thing. Sues are horribly written, by definition. That gives the advantage to your well-written agents, because your agents can be flexible, think on their feet (heck, think, period), and the Sue is little better than a pre-programmed cardboard character. Creativity is always better than power. Get irony and comedy on your side, and all but the most powerful God-mode Sues should be easy pickings.</p>

            <p>You weren&#39;t exactly forgotten - threads get lost, especially when they&#39;re pushed to the second page. But generally, if comments and problems are brought up, we wait until a new post is made with all those problems remedied - which is exactly what happened. <br><br>Anyway, I&#39;m not entirely comfortable with Kath retaining her author-endowed &quot;very good fighter&quot; traits just because it seems like the sort of thing that Canon and Reality (and the Flowers) would revoke. Similarly, as you say, Elena&#39;s &#39;Speech of Wizards&#39; should probably not be used, at least in Star Wars, but other than that, they look fine. Just be careful with how you write them and there should be no problem. <br><br>In your writing sample, I like how you&#39;ve done Yoda - <i>&quot;Sometimes,&quot; Yoda replied, &quot;laugh one must.</i> - that&#39;s the kind of silly-without-being-absurd humour I look for. The end made ma laugh Very nice :D<br><br>Concerning the badfics, that second one looks too short to be much of a mission, but that&#39;s up to you. I&#39;m not sure why you want to wait until the first is updated (I see enough OOCness and punctuation errors despite it also being fairly short), but either one will work.<br><br>Go forth and write! :)</p>

            <p>It&#39;s not at all out of the ordinary for a PPC agent to be good at combat, either because they&#39;ve practiced (veteran agents) or because they were recruited from a continuum where it&#39;s normal to be a competent fighter (for example, one of my agents is a LotR dwarf, and a good fighter). <br><br>Agents who are good fighters can still face serious challenges because they need to be realistically good fighters, and that means that they will still have to deal with things like being outnumbered or facing Sueperpowers. Plus, a good chunk of PPC work doesn&#39;t involve fighting at all. Doesn&#39;t matter how well you can swing a sword if your current obstacle involves not throwing up all over your partner because the Suethor just perpetrated eleven tense shifts and a run-on sentence in the space of one paragraph.<br><br>The Speech probably doesn&#39;t work nearly as well, if it works at all, outside the YW-verse. Continua where other kinds of magic exist might support it slightly; continua where many different kinds of magic exist might support it fully.<br><br>There&#39;s also the question of whether she just knows the Speech, or whether she can actually use it to tell the continuum what to do. If she&#39;s a full-fledged (if weak) wizard, then that means she&#39;s got all the obligations that being a YWverse wizard entails, and her loyalties are actually divided between the fight against badfic and the fight against entropy.<br><br>On the other hand, if she&#39;s not a wizard, then the Speech is probably good for communication and little else--a substitute for the Universal Translator and a way of talking to (usually non-sentient) objects.</p>

            <p>I was only referring to the &quot;for no reason&quot; aspect, and the point that if it&#39;s too Sueish, it could fall apart due to lack of logic after recruitment. How that&#39;s dealt is up to the author&#39;s sense of humour, but as long as it&#39;s not a SueperPowerExcellentFighter! sort of thing, it&#39;s not going to be a problem. </p>

            <p>Hello,<br><br>I&#39;ve been aware of the PPC for a while, via OFUM and the HFA, and then a few days ago I randomly thought of it again and have been obsessing over it since. I am fond of making impulsive internet &quot;commitments&quot; that I don&#39;t actually keep up. We&#39;ll see how well this lasts (I am hoping well). For reference, of my six Firefox windows open, three are PPC-related things, either directly (this one has PPC wiki pages and two Mary Sue litmus tests, another one has The Fantastic Saga of SNAOL and a terrible Animorphs fanfic, and the third is bad Dark is Rising Sequence fanfic). Normally I don&#39;t keep this much stuff open, but I&#39;m on dialup for the month, so I&#39;m just not closing tabs. &gt;.&gt; OH WELL.<br><br>Anyway, here I am. I&#39;ve never actually gotten around to WRITING fanfic, except kind of sort of a flash fiction story written with the Percy Jackson and the Olympians books in mind. Mostly the closest I get to writing fanfic is reading someone else&#39;s story and thinking &quot;I wish I&#39;d written that&quot;. When I actually write it&#39;s by and large original fiction.<br><br>I don&#39;t tend to get righteously angry at bad fanfic, more...confused. Especially by the reviews. Do people actually think these are good? Or that they make any sense whatsoever? Call me stupid, or something, but I don&#39;t see it. If in chapter 2 of your story literally nothing even remotely relevant to the plot happens, and you yourself acknowledge it, why did you bother to write it? It boggles the mind. And you created a mini while you were at it. Nice going!<br><br>Um. I like books. I like some movies. I like not too many TV shows. My favorite books include the Dark is Rising sequence, Animorphs, the Graveyard Book, anything by David Levithan, anything by Diana Wynne Jones, things by Tamora Pierce, Ender&#39;s Game, the Ender&#39;s Shadow books, the Young Wizards books (and the Feline Wizardry books), the Riddle-Master trilogy, and No Great Mischief. To name a very few. And to not name some that I feel like I must be the only person who&#39;s read. I&#39;m still hoping someday I will meet someone who read the Star Trek: The Next Generation: Starfleet Academy books. I also enjoy role-playing games, although the last time I have been able to play one with any consistency was a number of years ago. Seventh grade, perhaps. My current RPG obsessions are Young Gods of Old Egypt and the Marvel Universe Role-Playing Game, but I am also a fan of both 3.5 and 4E D&amp;D and a number of the other 24-hour RPGs. Also Darksword Adventures, which I am dying to play.<br><br>I could list movies and TV shows, too, but I will not, as I think I have already rambled enough at you all and it r laet. Hence, to bed! Which is to say, to lie on my bed and skim through &quot;Killed Badfic&quot; on the wiki. &gt;.<br>Respectfully yours,<br>Lleu Llaw Gyffes</p>

            <p>It&#39;s come to our attention that our <a href="http://fanfic_land.webs.com/">poor little website</a> has been <b>sadly neglected</b> by all our old friends from the <a href="http://fanfic_land.webs.com/Category.htm">Internet Culture</a> section. No-one wants that, so we&#39;ve come to invite you back!<br><br>Of course, we hope you <b>want</b> to come back to us, but in case you need a hand making up your mind, we&#39;re holding a <u>very special event</u>!<br><br>For the next seven days - that&#39;s one single week - we will be giving every Fanfic Land member who posts a story or chapter in our <a href="http://fanfic_land.webs.com/Page1.htm">Protectors of the Plot Continuum</a> section an exclusive, personalised banner on their user-page. Of course, we welcome stories for other sections too!!<br><br>So whether you&#39;re an old hand at Fanfic Land, or you&#39;ve never written with us before, get your thinking caps on... and get writing!<br><br>[[Yes, for the fifth year running, Fanfic Land is opening its doors for the PPC Badfic Contest. This is the time to indulge your inner badficcer, troll or parodist. Do you secretly &#39;ship Marquis de Sod/Acacia? Write it! Do you think Architeuthis would be a lot cooler if she were an Elven Jedi? Write it! Do you wonder what would happen if Eragon and Bella Swan were partners in the PPC? Write it!<br><br>Unfortunately for my sense of style, I do need to discuss some practical matters. Fanfic Land is a non-interactive website - I&#39;ll be putting everything from the Contest up on it afterwards, but the actual game needs to be played entirely in this thread. Sorry.<br><br>Next up, so that I can actually put them onto FfL, every story <b>needs</b> to have the following:<br><br>-A title<br>-A story summary<br>-A category (probably &#39;PPC&#39;, but you <b>can</b> write for anything)<br>-A rating (G, PG, PG-13, R, NC-17, after the old Fanfic.net system)<br>-One or two genres (which can include &#39;general&#39;, and are one word each)<br>-A title for every chapter (this is optional; if you don&#39;t want your chapters titled, you can leave this out)<br><br>Of course, you don&#39;t want to use your usual, boring, Canon-loving screenname, so come up with a new one! You can review other stories with it (by commenting on the chapter you&#39;re reviewing), and even set up an account by posting here with an author bio. You&#39;ll need an account to write any stories, so if you post a chapter, give me a bio at the same time, please.<br><br>Remember - nothing on FfL is real. We&#39;ve had people write hatefic in previous years - we&#39;ve had flamers - we&#39;ve had some truly awful badfic - but it&#39;s all just a game. So enjoy yourselves!<br><br>A few closing notes:<br><br>-You can take part in the game whoever you are. You don&#39;t have to have Permission or anything.<br>-You can write about anyone in the PPC (with the usual exception of Stormsong and Skyfire). That means you can use anyone&#39;s agents, any Flowers, anyone or -thing. Canon doesn&#39;t matter.<br>-If you&#39;re a returning player and want to change your bio from last year, feel free! Just stick the new one up here and I&#39;ll switch it.<br>-<b>Have fun</b>!<br><br>hS]]</p>

It was a week after the incident with Tom Matúsalez, and Marrim had taught the class that day.  She had really ripped into Nara, as though realizing what she&#39;d done to the real Eedrah had not driven the point home.<br>&quot;Maybe you should have given them a balloon and card, like Needa in the spoof,&quot; replied Dhozonesh.  &quot;Or maybe you should have just cut class.&quot;<br>&quot;Here?&quot; declaimed Nara with a good deal of incredulity.  &quot;With mini-Camoudiles and Piercing Squees and all?  Did you just link in from Tangaroa (A/N: That&#39;s the name of a planet in a Heinlein novel)?&quot;<br>&quot;Maybe.&quot;<br>&quot;I&#39;ll pretend I didn&#39;t hear that.&quot;  About that time, they had reached the cafeteria.  Agents Madison and Gilbert in deep discussion and Nara felt something weird, of a sudden.  &quot;Dhozonesh?&quot; she whispered.  &quot;I don&#39;t think it&#39;s just her breath that&#39;s hot.&quot;<br>&quot;What do you mean?&quot;<br>&quot;Everything about her,&quot; Nara quietly declared.<br><br>N&amp;M N&amp;M N&amp;M N&amp;M N&amp;M<br><br>&quot;So what is the new Detention Age?&quot; queried Gilbert.<br>&quot;He&#39;darra,&quot; replied Madison (A/N: That&#39;s where the Terahnee trained their slaves to obey, never make a sound, and basically never have a thing to hope for.  And if you flame this story, you&#39;re no better than them).  &quot;Rowan and Bentley decided that too-tough puzzles weren&#39;t enough.&quot;  She glanced at the table.  Cupid, a mischievous lad, chose that moment to draw his bowstring back and fire at Madison.  She promptly fell in love with Nara.<br><br>(A/N: Short chapter, and I know this is unlikely for Madison, but this is my story.  And I can&#39;t believe they pulled my Tawaki/Dustin mpreg fic off FFN, or that it got a parade of flames over its two years.)</p>

            <p>Category: PPC<br>Title: Love Thy Partner<br>Summary: What really happened during the lockdown in the RC #999?  SS/IAF/JR  Please Read and Review!!!  Rated R for lemons.  Romance.  One-shot.<br><br>Story:<br>A/N I am a big fan of Neshomeh&#39;s Agents.  They are fun and interesting and Agent Ilraen is awesome because he is an Andilite and they are from the best series ever written.  Neshomeh is awesome.  I would like to shake that guys hand.<br><br>The lockdown was happening.  The Megaviruses were all over the hq.  In the RC #999 Agent Simon Supernumbery and Agent Ilraen Airline Feathergold were working out.  &quot;98 99 100&quot; said Agent Simon who was doing pushups.  Agent Ilraen was lifting weights near the closet.  &quot;How much longer will the lockdown be happening?  It has been going on for weeks and I am getting bored.&quot; said Agent Ilraen.  Agent Simon walked to his chair where his shirt was.  When he put on the shirt his muscles made it hard to button.  He said &quot;Who knows.  It could go on forever with the flowers in charge of the hq.&quot;  Agent Simons voice was emotionless and musical.  (I read once that he is half elf half vulcan.  I think he is the kid of Spock and the guy from Lord of the Rings that was played by Agent Smith from the Matrix because that is who he looks like.)  Agent Ilraen stopped lifting weights and said &quot;Well what should we do while we are stuck in here?&quot;  Agent Simon looked up and raised one of his eyebrows because he had an idea about what they could do.  He said &quot;We could do sex to each other.&quot;  Agent Ilraen looked at him for a minute and said &quot;ok but I have a really good idea.  I have been secretly getting the dna of everyone in the ppc so you can have sex with anyone in the ppc that you want to have sex with&quot;.  Agent Simon thought for a minute and whispered into Agent Ilraens ear.  Agent Ilraen then morphed from his blue centaur form into the form of a woman.  Agent Ilraen had morphed into a naked Agent Jenny Robinson.  Agent Ilraen said &quot;come here Agent Simon&quot;.  Agent Simon took his shirt off showing off his rippling muscles and then he took off his pants and went over to Agent Ilraen.  They started having sex.  They changed positions a couple of times.  While they were having sex they did not hear the announcement that the lockdown was over.  The real Agent Jenny walked in and saw herself having sex with Agent Simon and thought it was a good idea so she joined in.  They all had sex with each other until Agent Ilraen had to turn back into an Andilite. (Because it would be really confusing to have two Agent Jennys in the ppc.)  Agent Simon and Agent Jenny saw that Agent Ilraen was hung like a horse (he is part horse you know) and they thought it might be fun to have sex with him in his Andilite form so they took turns letting him have sex with them and they thought it was great.  They kept doing it for a couple of hours and then they all went to sleep and Jenny moved in the next day and they all have sex all the time.<br><br>A/N Hope you liked it.  Please Review!!!<br><br>[[So, yeah...gonna call that good and not write anymore badfic for at least a day or two.  It scares me how easy this is.  ~Barid]]</p>

            <p>One day in what might be considered July by some, Jenni Robinson knocked on the door to RC #999, smirking with uncommonly sadistic glee. The door swished open, revealing that Nume and Ilraen were at home.<br><br>&lt;Hello, Jenni!&gt; Ilraen said. &lt;What brings you here?&gt;<br><br>&quot;What do you want?&quot; Nume echoed from his desk chair. He raised an eyebrow at the printout in her hand. &quot;What&#39;s that?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Seems you two have gained some notoriety,&quot; Jenni chirped. She handed Nume the printout. Ilraen peered at it over his shoulder. &quot;I found it online. Fanfic Land.&quot;<br><br>&quot;God damn it,&quot; Nume swore. &quot;I&#39;d like to give the idiot who thought that up a good smack. And the morons who take part...&quot; Against his better judgement, he got past the author&#39;s note and on to the actual text. &quot;Super<i>numbery</i>? The hell?&quot;<br><br>&lt;They did not even attempt to spell my name right! That is not my name! Nor yours, either; look! ... Nume?&gt;<br><br>Without warning, Nume had turned extremely pale. &quot;That <i>is</i> my name,&quot; he muttered.<br><br>The other two exchanged glances. The temperature in the room had actually dropped several degrees.<br><br>&quot;HOW THE HELL DID HE GET THAT INFORMATION?!&quot; Nume exploded, throwing the paper to the floor and shooting to his feet. He rounded on Jenni. &quot;Was it YOU, you goddamned meddler? Who told you?!&quot;<br><br>&quot;You mean that&#39;s actually your actual name?&quot; Jenni spluttered. She burst out laughing. &quot;Of all the crap in this fic... <i>that&#39;s</i>...&quot; she was laughing too hard to enunciate.<br><br>Meanwhile, Ilraen picked up the sheet again out of curiosity, even though he probably should have known better, and read the rest of it.<br><br>&lt;Uh, Nume? How does one &quot;do sex&quot; to another? Because in this fic, we--&gt;<br><br>&quot;<i>WHAT?!</i> Give me that!&quot; He snatched it back and read it through, turning several interesting shades ranging from white to red to green. It was almost like Christmas.<br><br>&quot;So what do you say, Simon?&quot; Jenni asked, grinning wickedly. &quot;You been secretly lusting after me all this time? You should have said something, you know, I&#39;d be more than happy--&quot;<br><br>&quot;<i>No!</i> Jesus Christ, no! <i>No!</i> That&#39;s--I--not--you--GAH! And don&#39;t call me that!&quot;<br><br>&lt;I am not really half horse,&gt; Ilraen complained quietly. However, one of his eyes wandered slowly backward and downward. This did not go unnoticed.<br><br>&quot;DON&#39;T EVEN THINK ABOUT IT! This does not bear thinking about! In fact, I&#39;m neuralyzing all of us, right now. This NEVER HAPPENED.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Well, that&#39;s my cue--bye!&quot; Jenni beat a hasty retreat, printout in hand. Entertainment for the day, check.<br><br>&quot;Jesus f****** Christ... All right, Ilraen, get over here.&quot;<br><br>&lt;What? <i>Really?</i>&gt;<br><br>&quot;Yes, really! You thought I was kidding? Hold still.&quot;<br><br>FLASH!<br><br>And thus, the badfic horror was no more.<br><br>EPILOGUE:<br><br>Nume and Ilraen continued their existence, blissfully unaware that anything unusual had transpired. Ilraen is still a virgin. Nume is still a prude.<br><br>Jenni has the printout taped to the wall in her office, no doubt for the occasional laugh at the end of a hard day. Since nobody ever goes in there, Nume&#39;s secret is safe... for now.<br><br>Neshomeh is not a guy.<br><br>(( Funny story: Barid claims he actually did not know that little bit of trivia before he decided to use it in the story. I&#39;m sure I must have told him at some point, but who knows? O.o ))</p>

            <p>Profile: I&#39;m D4rkm0k.  I haven&#39;t been writing long but I am really good at it.<br><br>Category: PPC<br>Title: In the DIO<br>Summary: In a hidden part of the ppc hq, three agents get together to be near their own kind.  EB/JA/JD  Please Read and Review!!!  Rated R for lemons.  Romance/Friendship.  One-shot.<br><br>Story<br><br>Agent Eamon Brightbeard walked along the corridors of the ppc hq.  He was late for his monthly meeting.  He led a lonely existance in the ppc.  It is hard being away from everyone who understands you.  His partner was a stupid troll and did not understand him at all.  So he got together with the only people who would understand him even though they were not from the same place.  As he was walking he came to a secret door.  He opened the door and walked through the secret passage.  When he came out the other side of the secret passage he was in DIO central.  He looked around and saw his good friend Agent Justin Agent ssitting across the room.  Agent Justin looked impatient that Agent Eamon was late.  He said &quot;Ye are late Eamon.  Where hath thou been?&quot;  Agent Eamon said &quot;I hast been walking through the hq.  I didst trye to get here on tyme.  My partner hath been a pain in my ass.  I couldst verily useth a distraction.&quot;  Agent Justin smiled at his friend.  He said &quot;Ye haveth my axe.&quot;  Then he stood up and moved his beard out of the way so he could unbutton his shirt.  When the dwarfs had their shirts off you couldn&#39;t tell where the beard ended and the chest hair started.  (Dwarfs are really hairy but you can&#39;t tell because they wear all that armor all the time and it presses it down.)  Then they took off their pants and were naked.  There cocks were allready hard and they were each over 12 inches long and really wide.  (They have to be really long to get through all the hair that they are covered in.)  Agent Eamon turned around and Agent Justin started to have sex with him.  After a few minutes they switched positions and Agent Brightbeard had sex with Agent Justin.  While they were doing it the secret door opened and another Dwarf walked in and said &quot;Wherefore art thou doing that guys?&quot; (Wherefore means why.  I learned that in my english class last year.)  Agent Jane Doe was the Dwarf that walked in.  She had a beard just like the guys did.  The guys stopped having sex for a minute to look at Agent Jane.  Agent Jane said &quot;I thought thou wouldst wait for me.&quot;  Then she took a gold strap-on out of her pocket and joined them.  (It is made of gold because gold is like lube for dwarfs.)  They all took turns having sex with each other for an hour and then they got dressed and said they would see each other next month.<br><br>A/N: I thought that all the dwarfs needed to get laid.  They are so stuffy...that&#39;s why all Dwarfs talk in Olde English.  So I had all the dwarfs in the hq get together.  Hope you liked it.  I am working on another story already and it should be even better.<br><br>[[Dear lord...who would write this stuff.  Ah well, I have a requested badfic still to come. ~Barid]]</p>

            <p>It is not Oldspek it is Olde Englishe.  And alot of people don&#39;t use it only Dwarves.  I figured it out when I was reading the mission where Agent Eamon saved an Orc from someone.  Agent Eamon says &quot;ye&quot; when he means &quot;you&quot; and that is Olde Englishe and if one Dwarf uses it then they all must because that is how it works in fantasy worlds.  And I bet you wouldnt mind it if there were Elves getting laid instead of Dwarves.  Everyone is racism against Dwarves!</p>

            <p>OMG I&#39;ve wanted to get back into writing for soooo long! It&#39;s been hard, cause my boss is a pain in the butt. NEWAI, I&#39;m Rae365 and I love PPC stories! I only wish there were more cute guys in the PPC. Well, you learn to make do!<br><br>I don&#39;t own any of the agents, I only wish I did! R&amp;R, please and thank you!<br><br>Title: What Happens On Leave...<br>Story Summary: Three PPC agents try to piece together what happened after a wild party while on leave. Ian Nahinu/Danny Richardson/Drake<br>Category: PPC<br>Rating: R<br>Genre: Romance/Humor<br><br>Ian woke up with a headache. Not that he was surprised or anything. Not with the amount of drinking that had happened the previous night.<br><br>The Flowers had essentially declared a weekend off for the entire PPC. He vaguely remembered the horrified look on the barman&#39;s face as hundreds of Assassins and Bad Slashers had queued up to order something to drink.<br><br>He was lying on the floor back in his own RC. &quot;Okay,&quot; he said. &quot;Gotta collect my thoughts. I was at the bar, I was listening to Lee compain about something, then I went outside for some fresh air and somebody said--&quot;<br><br>&quot;Move over, would you?&quot;<br><br>&quot;No, that wasn&#39;t it.&quot;<br><br>Ian suddenly noticed that he was not alone. There was a tall blond male agent lying next to him. Ian couldn&#39;t help noticing he didn&#39;t appear to be wearing any clothes, but was instead covered only with a blanket that had apparently been stripped off of one of the bunks.  There was a bundle of clothing next to him. &quot;Morning,&quot; the other agent said.<br><br>Ian leapt upright like the floor was on fire. &quot;What&#39;s going on!&quot; he shouted. &quot;Who are you and why are you naked!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Of course. No way you&#39;d remember my name from last night, not with the amount you drank. Danny Richardson. As for the nakedness, I think that&#39;s pretty self-evident.&quot; He nodded at Ian, who looked down to discover that he was also somewhat lacking in the clothing department.<br><br>He went pale. &quot;You mean we--&quot;<br><br>&quot;Oh come on,&quot; Danny said. &quot;I know we were all a bit plastered but it couldn&#39;t have been that forgettable. What was that thing you did with your hips during the second run-through? THAT was amazing.&quot;<br><br>Ian&#39;s eyes glazed over as parts of the previous night began coming back to him. &quot;We talked for a while, then went back inside for another drink, then I suggested we come back here...&quot;<br><br>&quot;You forgot the bit with the dancing in between the drinking and the leaving to come back here. You&#39;re very limber, which certainly came in handy.&quot;<br><br>&quot;And then -- wait, wasn&#39;t there someone else?&quot;<br><br>There was a groan from underneath the bundle of clothing, then it shuddered and gave birth to a Drake. He looked up at Ian and waved.<br><br>&quot;Morning, sunshine,&quot; Danny said. &quot;You certainly slept well.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Well, large amounts of exercise does make me very sleepy,&quot; Drake said with a smile. &quot;You two certainly helped in that regard.&quot;<br><br>Ian sunk to his knees, stunned. &quot;I really did all those things last night?&quot; he asked.<br><br>Drake gave the stupor-fied agent a confused look. &quot;What&#39;s with Ian?&quot;<br><br>&quot;He&#39;s just coming to grips with an acoholic sex crisis.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I know the cure for that!&quot; The anthro fox leaned over and whispered in Danny&#39;s ear.<br><br>&quot;You think that&#39;ll work?&quot; Danny replied.<br><br>&quot;It always cheers me up when I&#39;m down!&quot;<br><br>Ian looked up just time to see the two naked agents tackle him. &quot;This is for your own good,&quot; Danny whispered before putting his mouth to other uses.<br><br>Ten sweaty and eventful minutes went by.<br><br>&quot;I have to admit,&quot; Ian said. &quot;That did cheer me up.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I knew it would,&quot; Drake panted.</p>

Luxuricka<br>Category: PPC<br>Rating: R, shading to NC-17 later on.<br>Genre: Romance<br><br>Chapter I<br>&quot;I do not see why you continue to persist in this matter,&quot; Xericka said to the other occupant of the RC. &quot;My answer remains no.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Your mouth says no,&quot; Luxury replied with a saucy grin, &quot;but your body says take me now.&quot;<br><br>&quot;My body language indicates nothing of the sort.&quot;<br><br>This had been going on for a while now. Ever since their first mission together, Luxury had become fascinated with Xericka. Gremlin had suggested during a mission together in the Half Life continuum that the lacivious Bad Slasher had a crush on her. Xericka scoffed at the idea.<br><br>&quot;Aw come on, Xerry-berry.&quot; Lux hopped over the back of the sofa and sank onto the Nobody&#39;s lap. &quot;It&#39;ll do you a world of good. You really do need to loosen up. Get a little crazy.&quot;<br><br>Xericka pushed Luxury off of her. The blonde Slasher settled for sitting on the couch as close as possible. &quot;I do not get crazy. I do not get anything. Nobodies cannot feel emotions and do not have sex.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Ah, but those are two different things!&quot;<br><br>Xericka goggled at the other agent. &quot;Sexual intercourse and emotional bonding are intrinsically connected,&quot; she said.<br><br>Luxury rolled her eyes. &quot;Sex is all about physical stimulation, which I know Nobodies can feel. If you couldnt, there was no way you could have known that I pinched your butt the other day.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yes, but--&quot;<br><br>&quot;Can you feel this?&quot; Luxury ran her hands up and down Xericka&#39;s thighs.<br><br>&quot;Yes of course.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Are you havbing an emotional response or a physical one?&quot;<br><br>&quot;A phsyical response.&quot;<br><br>Luxury moved her hands up to the Nobody&#39;s stomach. &quot;And it&#39;s a pleasurable response, right?&quot;<br><br>&quot;...Yes.&quot;<br><br>The blonde agent&#39;s hands continued to migrate up Xericka&#39;s body. &quot;You&#39;d like to experience more, right.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I suppose, but my point--&quot;<br><br>She was interupted by Luxury&#39;s lips meeting hers. There was a faint metallic sound as the other woman unzipped her coat.<br><br>~~~<br><br>To be continued!</p>

Aw, hell, why not?<br>--Pretzel<br><br>Ian was idly browsing the newest stories on Fanfic Land when he came across a summary with his name in it. Given that said name was being associated with two other male names, and in a romantic sense at that, he clicked the link out of morbid curiosity.<br><br>Five minutes later, fully dressed and in the middle of toweling her hair dry, Lee came out of the bathroom and found her partner staring in shock at his laptop screen.<br><br>&#39;Something up, Ian?&#39; she asked, pausing in her attempts to get her short bob dry.<br><br>&#39;S-ss-&#39;<br><br>&#39;Use your words, Ian. You&#39;re not a snake, or at least, you weren&#39;t the last time I checked.&#39;<br><br>&#39;S-suh-slash,&#39; he managed, turning the laptop so that Lee could see what he&#39;d been reading. &#39;A three-way between--&#39; he trailed off, and then shuddered. Lee took the laptop from Ian, scrolled up to the top of the page, and then began reading. As she went through the story, her expression switched from vague worry for her partner to a rather disconcerting blankness. <br><br>&#39;I see what you mean,&#39; she said finally, staring thoughtfully at the laptop. &#39;Want me to write a scathing review?&#39;<br><br>Ian blinked and then shook his head. &#39;No,&#39; he replied. &#39;Just never mention it to me again, and I&#39;ll be good. I&#39;m just gonna drown myself in the Fountain of Bleepka. Be right back.&#39;<br><br>&#39;Well, at least it wasn&#39;t Bad Slash,&#39; Lee volunteered, clearing the history on Ian&#39;s browser after switching the page to Cute Overload. &#39;Here, look at some kittens.

DA END.<br><br>~~<br>(OOC A/N from Laburnum: For those unfamiliar, the joke here is that Hemlock and Laburnum are the same person. Hemlock is the name Agent Laburnum gave to her male persona, whom she becomes occasionally with a little help from the PPC&#39;s transformation tech. I&#39;m sorely tempted to do a dream sequence or something shipping them - is that incest or narcissism? - as part of the real PPC canon. Once the headache from writing like this goes away. Ow, my brain.<br><br>Sorry I can&#39;t let people use S&amp;S, but by the time we&#39;d contacted Snowspine to ask and she&#39;d got back to us the Fanfic Land week would be over. Maybe next year. Do something even more horrifying to my other agents in revenge, I dare you all! (I do ask that you don&#39;t write anything squicky with Molly and/or Moses without aging them up past puberty, not that I think anyone actually would, but I thought I&#39;d better say so to make sure. Other than that, anything goes.)<br><br>&quot;Blacker than the raven wings of midnight&quot; is in fact a quote from Poe&#39;s &quot;Ligeia&quot;. I&#39;m so sorry for mutilating it. I also got in several references to the infamous badfic &quot;My Immortal&quot; and I&#39;m not sorry at all for using that. The &quot;pills (of drugs)&quot; is from &quot;Forbiden Fruit&quot;, an equally impressive badfic.<br><br>So tempted to add a horrifying sex scene. Is that allowed under Fanfic Land rules, and would anyone&#39;s brain stand up to that? I think I&#39;d have to use a different fake account or give this &quot;writer&quot; a beta-reader who actually can spell because typing like that through a sex scene would give me nightmares ...)</p>

            <p>I think it&#39;d be too hard to write in txtspk, and those aren&#39;t really the kind I find funniest anyway. The ones I always find funnier are the ones with horribly inappropriate descriptions or words (&quot;mancarrot&quot;, to give one example) and physically impossible actions, and I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s too explicit for the Fanfic Land game.</p>

            <p>Child, listen: Your agent is a Sue. Do not tell me to &quot;go die&quot; because I am right. She has a ridiculous name and is breaking the rules of PPC canon by working solo as &#39;because she was good at her job&#39; is not a viable reason. The work agents do is dangerous and so they need at least two people working together in order to keep each other safe. <br><br>I commend you for attempting to use &quot;big words&quot;, but as you seem to have no grasp on the proper spelling of smaller ones, it is strongly suggested that you aim to master them first before attempting to use what is clearly our of your league.</p>

            <p>I think the Marqis and the So are underappreciated really and that&#39;s what makes them so mean sometimes but this story&#39;s good because if they were really mean and stuff then they would deserve this!</p>

            <p>Title: The Respectful Tale of Canon Correction<br>Rating: G <br>Genre: General  <br>Summary: Two agents, Honesty Jones and Charity Whipple, discuss their recent experiences in the PPC Cafeteria, and launch a brilliant plan to restore the agency to its original, pure form.<br><br><br>Author’s Note: Given the woeful lack of understanding and respect that has been shown towards this story, I have decided to continue regardless. Hopefully this time more readers will be able to digest the message I am trying to convey.<br><br><br>Chapter Two: A Meeting With The Sunflower Official<br><br><i>Agents Jones and Whipple – it is a pleasure to see you,</i> greeted the Sunflower Official as said agents stepped into his office, having knocked very politely just moments before. <i>What can I do for you today?</i><br><br>“Sir,” Honesty began in a clear, confident tone, “it has become clear to us – that is, Agent Whipple and myself – that the PPC is no longer functioning at optimum efficiency.”<br><br>The Flower nodded its large, yellow petals. <i>Sadly true. I must confess, Agent Jones, that the other Flowers and myself are at a loss for how to deal with this crisis. I don’t suppose either of you have any suggestions?</i><br><br>“Yes, we do,” said Charity happily; “we think you should stop partnering agents who might exaberate each others’ mental instabilities and-”<br><br>“Charity!” hissed Honesty. “You’re being very rude!”<br><br>Charity shrank back and hung her head. “I’m very sorry.”<br><br><i>No need to apologise,</i> said the Sunflower Official, gently patting her shoulder with its fronds. <i>You obviously know more about this problem than I do. Please, go on.</i><br><br>And so, for the next half hour, Honesty and Charity outlined every problem they had noticed within the PPC and explained their ideas about how to remedy them. The Sunflower Official was impressed.<br><br><i>I am impressed,</i> said the Flower. <i>It is clear to me now that only agents truly understand how this agency should function. Therefore, the two of you must take over management of the PPC.</i><br><br>Honesty and Charity demurred. “Oh, that’s too kind!”<br><br>“Sir, we couldn’t possibly…”<br><br><i>Ah, ah – none of that, Agent Jones. You two are clearly qualified. I will speak to the other Flowers, but as of this moment, I surrender my office to you.</i> <br><br>~ End of Chapter Two ~</p>

You might want to watch it with the sparkly perfect-ness though because <i>tht</i> is the sort of stuff that makes MarySues.

            <p>Summary: Everyone knows the Marqis de Sod is mean and stuff to everyone but what happened to make him that way?<br><br>Category: PPC - Fiction<br><br>Rated: PG-13 - English - Romance<br><br>AN: So I know I got really upset after last year when my last story got FLAMED by a bunch of mean people trying to say I could&#39;nt write and I thought I might give up on PPC storys if ppl were just goign to be nasty about them. But I read some of the old storys like the Origginal SEries and changed my mind so I decided to come back nd try again. Hopefully all the stupid flamers will  have gone away this time and if they haven;t and they&#39;re reading this now GO AWAY FLAMERS! And if you flame me I&#39;ll just use your flames for toastimg marshmallows!<br><br>Chapter 1<br><br>Back in the early days of the PPc when everything was new and shiny and the AGents didnt have to work so much the Flowers used to work with them more closely than they do now with all the FLowers upstairs in ofices.  anyway this story is from those faroff times when they worked side by side with the Agents and were close to them and some of them even grew close enough to their partners to.... love them. Because Flowers mihgt not have hearts in the same way that humans do but they still can feel and have feelings like them.<br><br>This is a tale of one flower who fell in love back then and how it changed him for ever...<br><br><b>FlOwErSfLoWeRsFlOwErSfLoWeRsFlOwErSfLoWeRsFlOwErSfLoWeRs</b><br><br>Agent Elli Lloysin rolled over in bed and smiled at her lover who lay beside her with his petals closed. (AN: Because flowers always close thir petals at night and my science teacher told me so it has to be true.) &quot;Wake up Marqis love&quot; she said. &quot;We have to get back to work soon&quot;.<br><br>His petals opened and he turned to her and wrapped his leaves around her to hold her close. &quot;I know but lets have just a few more minutes together like this first&quot;. &quot;I don;t want to get up yet and leave you&quot;.<br><br>&quot;That&#39;s all right dear&quot;. &quot;it&#39;s not like theres&#39; <i>lots</i> to do anyway&quot;. Elli snuggled down against him happily.<br><br>They had been parntered for a while now and although the Marqis was grumpy at firts because he was used to working with other FLowers he had grown to care about Elli and her gentle ways because she was always so understandign when he gor grumpy at her and never got grumpy back at him. But this made him even more grumpy sometimes because he didn&#39;t think he could tell her how he felt in case she laughed at him because Flowers and agents had never cared about each other that way before. (AN: This is befor Jaycacia was born so that&#39;s why I said that because we all know they can really and it jsut takes a specail person.)<br><br>One day the Marqis got so upset because of being grumpy that he YELLED at Elli and made her cry. He felt sorry straight away and said he was sorry for it. When she stoped crying she asked him why he was always so grumpy when she tryed so hard to be nice to him. He hung his bloom sadly and said &quot;I don&#39;t think i can say because its a silly thing to think about&quot;. And she sighd and said &quot;It can&#39;t be silly if it makes you so upset and I wish you&#39;d tell me because then we can get it sorted&quot;. &quot;i promise I&#39;ll never lauhg at you for it whatever it is because I care about you andI wouldn&#39;t be so mean&quot;.<br><br>When she said that he couldn&#39;t help but feel happy and he  took a deep breath (AN: I know flowers can&#39;t really breathe but let&#39;s just say he did) and said &quot;I think i&#39;m in love with you&quot;. &quot;I&#39;ve cared about you for a long time now but i was afraid you wouldn&#39;t feel the same way so I tried to hide it but I can&#39;t any more&quot;.<br><br>Elli starred at him for a few moments and then her pale blue eyes filled with shining tears which she wiped away as they began to run down her cheeks. &quot;Oh Marqis&quot; she said. &quot;I wsh you&#39;d told me sooner even if you were afraid because you should know by now I&#39;dn ever laugh at you for something like that&quot;. &quot;We can&#39;t help our feelings&quot;.<br><br>&quot;I&#39;m sorry&quot; the Flower said sadly. &quot;You don&#39;t think it;s silly&quot;?<br><br>&quot;of course not&quot;. &quot;I care about you too you know and I&quot;..<br><br>&quot;You what&quot;? He reached out wth one leaf and wiped away her tears because he felt so sad at seeing her cry.<br><br>&quot;I.... think i love you too&quot;.<br><br>He gasped. &quot;Really&quot;?! She smiled up at him and reached out to him. &quot;Yes really&quot;. &quot;I&#39;m glad you told me because now we can be together forever and I;m sure none of the others will mind becaus ethey&#39;ll be so glad to see you happy again&quot;.<br><br>&quot;yes of course&quot; he whispered as he held her close. &quot;I love you Elli&quot;.<br><br>&quot;I love you too Marqis dear&quot; she murmred as she leaned against him. And she was right and everyone else was soo happy for them that they always tryed to make sure Elli and the Marqis were close to each other.<br><br><b>FlOwErSfLoWeRsFlOwErSfLoWeRsFlOwErSfLoWeRsFlOwErSfLoWeRs</b><br><br>Elli finally sat up and got out of bed slowly. &quot;Come on love&quot; she said kindly. &quot;We shouldn&#39;t lie in bed when there are missions to do&quot;.<br><br>&quot;Oh very well&quot; he sighed and got up and dressed with her. Just as they finished getting dressed there was a BIP! from their console and they went to look.<br><br>It was a message from the SUnfloewr Official!<br><br><i>[Hello Marquis and Agent Lloysin. Please come upto my offcie at once as I have something very important to say to you.]<br><br>They looked at each other and then hurried out of the door. &quot;I guess we&#39;re not goign on misisions today&quot; Elli said happily as they went to the office.<br><br>&quot;No I guess not&quot; the Marqis replied as he knokced at the door and they waited together to find out what the SO wanted...<br><br><br>Hehe I bet you all can;t wait to find out what happened! Well hopefully I&#39;ll be able to write the next chappie soon and I hope I get nice reviews because they make me want to write MORE! (Hint hint)! <br><br>PLEASE R&amp;r!</i></p>

Elli asked inquisitively. &quot;We&#39;re not in trouble are we&quot;?<br><br>&quot;No no of course not&quot; he reassurred her. &quot;this  is good news for you both&quot;. &quot;I&#39;ve talked to the other Flowers and we decide that you two are in too much danger on misions and your love might be in danger&quot;.<br><br>&quot;We don&#39;t mind sir&quot; Elli said bravely. &quot;It&#39;s our duty&quot;.<br><br>&quot;Well I mind&quot; he said sternly but kindly. &quot;We&#39;ve decided to make a new position for the Marqis and you are going to help him with it&quot;.<br><br>&quot;What position is that dir&quot;? said the Marqis humbly. &quot;I never thought I&#39;d be any good at anything important&quot;.<br><br>&quot;You are going to be the Head of the Adminitsration Deppartment and Elli will be your personal asistant&quot; the SO declared. &quot;We know you&#39;ll be good at it because you two are good at working together and youre so good with paprwork and stuff&quot;.<br><br>&quot;Oh thank you thank you sir&quot; said Elli and sje jumped for joy and hugged the Marqis. &quot;Isn&#39;t that wonderful love&quot;? &quot;Now we never have to risk losing each other again&quot;!

Elli got a bit afraid but tryed to be brave for her lover and said &quot;What shall we do because we can&#39;t die here&quot;?<br><br>One of the Sues who had trapped them who was all sparkly and perfect and evil laughed evilly. &quot;You WILL die here&quot;! she laughed and all the others laughed too. &quot;We will kill all the Flowers and then the Agents too&quot;!<br><br>Elli shoulted &quot;NEVER&quot;! and hurled herself in fromnt of the Marqis to save him as the Sues approached...<br><br><br>Hehehe a CLIFFIE!!1 if I get NICE reviews I&#39;ll post the next chappie very soon okay!

            <p>Canon Queen has several excellent points and if you would simply follow her instructions rather than throwing a tantrum worthy of a five-year-old, your writing may, someday, actually become worth the time it takes to read. <br><br>Canon Queen, I thank you for your honesty and applaud you for taking on such childish opponents as this.</p>

            <p>If you would take a mere five minutes to compare my stories with those of Canon Queen you would see that our writing styles are very different; therefore, we cannot possibly be the same person. <br><br>Also, this is not bullying. This is an attempt to save your story. I, at least, thought you might appreciate that. Clearly, I was wrong.</p>

            <p><br>Disclaimer: Everything that can be attributed to another author belongs to another author.<br><br>It had been several days since the death of everyone in the Multiverse, and Makes-Things and Lyta were still in a state of disbelief and depression. They had taken to ‘doing it’ with one another,knowing that as the last biologically compatible pair of sentients in the Multiverse, it was now their duty to repopulate it.<br><br>One day, as Makes-Things was tired out from Lyta&#39;s &quot;ministrations&quot;, she said:<br><br>&quot;So. what was the &#39;thing&#39; that killed my prospective partner?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Agent Tara-Something was killed... was killed...&quot;<br><br>&quot;By what? Makes-Things, please tell me.&quot;<br><br>&quot;It was the DIO. They suspected that the Leauge of Mary Sue Factories may attempt one last infilitration of HQ in order to ensure their survival in the face of the NMG threat.&quot;<br><br>&quot;And we were the prime suspects?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yes. It was the names that alerted us. Tara&#39;s, because of it&#39;s similarity to the name of My Immortal&#39;s author, and your&#39;s, because of it&#39;s attempt to mark you as a relative of Linda Holling, one of OFUM&#39;s first students.&quot;<br><br>&quot;But now... I don&#39;t care anymore. The Multiverse is dead, killed by... someone or something we have not anticipated. I would rather... have it ressurected half-sue than have it not ressurected at all.&quot;<br><br>&quot;You know what?&quot; said Lyta. &quot;I think the same way.&quot;<br><br>She openly revealed the beautiful rainbow colored orbs that served her as eyes, and drew Makes-Things into her once again.<br><br>Truly, she was the luckiest Mary Sue on this reborn Multiverse.  <br></p>

            <p>Hello there, my name is Burning Visionary. I used to be called Burning Watier, before I saw the light of Honest Critic (any rumors that I am only sucking up to her for something called &#39;lulz&#39; is <i><b>Slander</b></i>, and all who spread those will be reported to Admin) and her words. However, I have another loyalty that is totally compatible with hers and cannot be used to withdraw my strength from her cause (and those who say so are commiting <b><i>Slander!</i></b>).<br><br>My Prophetic dreams. <br><br>You see, PPC: Time of Judgement and EPC: Gehenna are not just stories, they are visions of things that will really happen to the PPC and EPC in the future. Fire <i>will</i> engulf the Word Worlds, and characters we saw as fixtures of both organizations will die. The Multiverse has a finite lifespan, and it will-<br><br><i><b>Hacked</b></i> profile: As you can see, this author has gone insane. Honest Critic is a poser canon warrior who cannot even write any genre right, leading to fics whose only redeeming quality are their general coherence, which is only a vehicle for more subtle defilement. May the true PPC spork their fics both. I will wait for that day...</p>

            <p><br>EPC: Ghehenna<br><br><br> Summary:,/br&gt; You’ve all heard how the PPC ended. Now is the EPC’s turn.<br><br><br>Disclaimer: Everything that belongs to another author isn’t mine.<br><br><br>Author’s Note: This is a sequel to my fic PPC: Time of Judgement.<br><br><br><i>Hacked</i> Author’s Note: Beware! This abomination contains a lot of Ass Pulls, OOCness, Dethroning Moments of Suck and overt Canon Defilement of a variety never before seen. You have been warned.<br><br><br>Prologue: The Emperor’s final hour.<br><br>The EPC HQ was in a state of revelry. The SE was going forth to war himself for the first time in so many centuries, prodded by his new allies, the New Multiverse Government. The greatest smiths from the reaches of his suefied Multiverse had been called to his side to produce arms and armour for what could be his greatest battle. So far, they have created a green mask made of sueified steel, four great wings made from the same material, and mithril armour studded with emeralds. He held four Masamunes in his four hands, for he had decided long ago that more limbs meant an extra edge in a fight.<br><br>Thousands upon thousands of Sues and Stus danced in revelry, wearing scanty but colourful costumes. The NMG plenipotentiary wearing dour corporate clothes seemed like an eyesore to them, but they knew that even with his plain drabness, he was still high in the favour of their lord. After what seemed several hours, a portal opened, and the final components of the Sunflower Emperor’s regalia were revealed: leggings made from Balrog Leather that were set with rubies and orange topaz to complement the flames.<br><br>Perfect, the Sunflower Emperor said. Thanks to the arms and armour you made me, I now have enough power to squash the last remnants of my opposition in that bothersome parallel universe. You will be well rewarded, along with the emissary from the NMG that roused me to this action.  The great plant stood up, and walked over to the unfazed plenipotentiary, who was fiddling with a suitcase that he held. He then brought out one of his Masamunes from its sheath, and touched the diplomat’s shoulder lightly.<br><br>I dub you...second-in-command in the Mysterious Somebody’s place! The assembled Suvians cheered in applause, while the aforementioned Mysterious Somebody fumed quietly in a corner. The NMG operative just bowed, while another portal, this time to the crystal Star Destroyer and Nebulon-B frigates which he would use for the attack, opened.  The SE and about half of the assorted Sues and Stus on the floor then went towards it in perfect military order. Once they were gone, the mood quickly darkened.  <br><br>“Tsk tsk tsk...” said the Mysterious Somebody. “You’ve really overstretched your hand this time, plenipotentiary. An increase of recklessness in the SE was something I can tolerate, a decrease of intelligence even more so, but having he replace me with you even though you have no support in this Multiverse other than what he’s given? Just before it was cut off from you? What are you planning?”<br><br>“<i>Death.</i> You will die here today, along with the organization that you craved control of.  We have imposed our own version of your origins upon this Multiverse, and we have adorned it with traps that your hubris-tainted brain cannot perceive. From my suitcase...I unleash the Withering!” Said suitcase then opened, unleashing a storm of gray moths upon the throng. The Mysterious Somebody’s extremities began to turn grey, falling apart into fine dust.  <br><br> A few moments later, the same thing happened to the other Sues and Stus. The NMG operative just smiled as the Mysterious Somebody, unable to use his Force Powers, died. Everyone else in the room except him did so as well. The malady spread through the EPC HQ, and its panicking inhabitants fled to the wider Multiverse, infecting every Suvian they came across. With every death from the Withering, energy reverberated. And the energy awoke beings that, in the EPC’s retconned history, were buried in hidden tombs to increase the Sunflower Emperor’s power.<br><br>The Suetelluvians’ time has come.<br></p>

            <p>Chapter One: A New World Rises<br><br>Disclaimer: Anything that can be attributed to another author belongs to another author.<br><br>Captain Bigs Darkligther (AN: Totally not stolen I swear!) paced along his Magitek ship, the New Momergil, in agitation. The New Multiverse Government’s counterpart in this Multiverse, the New Multiverse Patriots, had managed to combine the resources of several worlds in an act of defiance against the EPC, attempting to rally opposition to it. In response, the NMG had sent his ship and a great fleet accompanied with several superweapons, most of them with the ability to depopulate galaxies several times over or worse.  He had substantial ground forces with him as well, billions upon billions of Zerg and Tyraninds enclosed in a pocket dimension.<br><br>His mission was to help the EPC subdue the rebels, then betray them once the Withering had started, taking the worlds for the NMG and extracting as much money, pleasure, and energy from them. He had other ideas, however. There were many ‘closet idealists’ in the NMG forces, people who believed that the purpose of the organization should be to unite the resources, technology, skills, and energies of the various worlds of the Multiverse in an attempt to increase the sum of happiness for all sentient beings. He was one of them.  <br><br>“Have the failsafes been disabled, Alvin?”<br><br>“Yes, Captain. How goes the secret transmissions?”<br><br>“They’re going well. Diplomatic officers Thor and Anja have managed to get them to agree to a joint attack on the EPC Fleet we’re supposed to reinforce just as soon as we get to their location. Which should be about-“<br><br>They emerged into realspace, where the EPC Fleet was hovering above a beautiful green world. The explosions began almost immediately. The New Momergil began shooting machine incapacitation beams at the best ships, in order to secure as much war material for their future rebellion.<br>After the quick victory, he met with his counterparts from the NMP, Admirals Lorena and Sylvester. <br><br>“That went too well”, said Lorena, brushing aside her brown hair to get it out of the way. “Is it that Withering thing?”<br><br>“I think so”, said Sylvester, a thoughtful look in his eyes. “The Boarding Parties we sent to the ships found only mounds of dust inside, explaining the lack of opposition and corroborating what Captain Bigs said about the retconned history.”<br><br>“I still don’t like it. Maybe our good defector has something to say?”<br><br>“Merely this: I share your suspicions about this battle. My former superiors shouldn’t be this easy to dupe. They’re genre savvy enough to place a trap when we least expect it and-“<br><br>Suddenly, a light shone out from the planet’s surface. A brown beam of light that brought a feeling of disgust to all that looked upon it, bringing memories of the most disgusting things they ever saw into the forefront.<br><br>A light that in the retconned history imposed upon the Mirror Multiverse, represented the first of the Suetelluvians: Celebrian.<br><br>“AND SHE WILL LAST FOR MILLENIA!”<br><br>“LAA-ST FOR MILLE-NIA!” <br><br>Ground cameras focused on the planet would have recorded a gigantic tomb opening up in the northern hemisphere, where a shape that looked like the infamous Character Replacement can be seen in the cloud of mist-at least they thought it was mist- that emanated from the doors. Giant black sticks with legs began swarming out of the structure, transforming the region into a disgusting hellscape that would have done Slaneesh proud.<br><br>The oceans and rivers turned into bodily fluids unmentionable in polite conversation, the forests assumed shapes that the mind instantly blocked out, the animals received unrealistically large body parts while the sentients were turned into orcs to join the Suetelluvian’s existing retinue. Worst of all, however, was that the largest of all the black sticks were able to fly up into the air, with every indication that they intended to reach the ships orbiting above them.<br><br>Captain Bigs hesitated for a moment, then said: “Fire!”   <br></p>

Over the years of the retconned history, her glittery blood has been used to create Goff!Sues that spread the Theme Park version of Gothicness and Satanism (frequently misspelled into Stanism or <i>Santa</i>nism) throughout the Multiverse.<br><br>The EPC Agent B&#39;loody Mary, who had betrayed her mistress out of love (some would say lust) for the Sunflower Emperor; led an army of Preps against the awakened entity. They unleashed a storm of Fan-made spells at it, formed from years of research into the powers offered by Glitter. The Methsuleah called upon spells from outside her own universe, creating walls of sunlight and fire against her former master.<br><br>Not once did she think of using steak and crosses.<br><br>The Suetelluvian lifted up her &quot;Blak&quot; Wand, and said: &quot;Avcara Kedabra!&quot;<br><br>A green beam of light came from the wand, and all of the Prep!Sues died.<br><br>&quot;How could U bertay mi B&#39;loody Mary!&quot;<br><br>&quot;I&#39;m sorry!

            <p>Chapter Three: Battle for Arda.<br><br>Disclaimer: You all know that I don&#39;t own LOTR, Celebrian, and Laura.<br><br>Celebrian sat on top of an immense &#39;Black Stick&#39;, feeling something other than lust in her heart, hate. The ancient Sunflower Emperor and her treacherous Methsuleahs had placed her on another planet, exiling her from the Misty Mountains that she so loved. It was not only an act of spite, but also a way to strengthen her rival, one of the few Sues in her world to match her power.<br><br><i>Laura</i>. She must have awakened by now, as the Withering reverbrated through the EPC&#39;s ranks. The hate between them was strong, enough to force the other Sues and Stus to call upon the Sunflower Emperor to entomb them. Even their loyal Methsuleahs had abandoned them, telling them to &quot;f*** off&quot;, and not literally.<br><br>But now, the Loli had Arda all to herself, and had gotten rid of the remnants of the NMG for her. How lucky. Her &#39;Black Stick&#39; then impacted the planet&#39;s atmosphere, the sturdy warts attached to it withstanding the heat. After several hours of what seemed like hell, she finally landed near the Misty Mountains, where Laura and the Suvian!Fellowship were besieging the last of the orcs.<br><br>&quot;You will not be live you eleven whore&quot; said Laura without respect for spelling and grammar.<br><br>&quot;I <i>love</i> being a whore!&quot; Celebrian said. Her &#39;Black Stick&#39; launched a stream of unsanitary fluids at the girl, but Suvian!Gandalf made a magic shield and kept Laura&#39;s group safe.<br><br>&quot;U shoudnt have let those orcs live along with Sauron.&quot; Laura said. &quot;Dey are raposts and should die.&quot; She used her &#39;power to distoy the bad guys&#39; to blast Celebrian with orange fires, which failed to burn the Sue&#39;s naked body.<br><br>Celebrian laughed. More &#39;Black Sticks&#39; landed around her enemies.<br><br>&quot;I have always been smarter than you,&quot; she said.<br><br>Then she called forth her armies of OOC orcs, and the Laws of Badfic instantly incapacitated Laura in anticipation of an angsty capture and torment.<br><br>Celebrian did not plan to disappoint.<br></p>

            <p>Chapter Six: The Penultimate Suetelluvian.<br><br>Disclaimer: You know the drill.<br><br>In the center of the EPC HQ, Captain Dandy and the Sub Rosa were holding together the last remnants of their once great Departments, repelling attacks from Rouge Agents, NMG Space Marines, and forces from the risen Suetelluvians. The remnants of Legal had been withdrawn to what was once the SO&#39;s office, and were attempting to find a way to reverse their adverse fortunes. But time was running short, and nothing had been found yet.<br><br><i>We&#39;re going to die here</i>, said the DES leader.<br><br><i>Have some hope. We can&#39;t be the only survivors of this organization.<br><br>Even so, we have no one but ourselves to aid in our endeavor.</i> <br><br>Another NMG Space Marine rushed their defensive cordon, killing more Sues and Weeds.

At this rate, we will never-</i><br><br>Suddenly, bright light shone from the former SE&#39;s office. The doors opened, and a replesendent woman in a bikini of Jade Leaves shaped like that of Maples and Oaks walked out. She wore a crown of laurels and hollies, transmuted into gold long ago by a wandering Alchemist.<br><br>She then drew a whip of (AN: My computer does not have enough memory for the description), and charged towards the NMG Marines.<br><br>Emboldened by her example, Captain Dandy and the Sub Rosa charged against their enemies, leading their remaining Suvians in a final sortie. With the Suetelluvian&#39;s help, they began to clear the former HQ, room by room and corridor by corridor. When the NMG and the rival Suetelluvians&#39; forces had been driven out, Jayacacia stood in front of the two EPC officers, and said:<br><br>&quot;Long ago, when the other Suetelluvians were jealous of me, my husband and my Methsuleahs chose to seal me away in the land of Avalon, where I would be kept safe until the Eternal Suvian Paradise was established.&quot;<br><br>&quot;But I look around me and what do I see? My Husband dead, the EPC scattered, and my rivals in a greater state of power than ever before. Why have you let all of this fall into ruin? Why?&quot;<br><br>Captain Dandy and Sub Rosa pointed their leaves at each other in postures of accusation.<br><br>&quot;So I see. You continue to shift the blame for this even now. That cannot be allowed.&quot;<br><br>Jayacacia raised up her arms, and the two Flowers were deleted from the story, along with all of their followers.<br><br>&quot;Farewell, place that I once knew. I will now retreat into Avalon once again, not to wait until another battle comes, but to grieve forever until the end of time.&quot; And so with a single tear trailing down her beautiful place, Jayacacia left the Mirror Multiverse, never to return.<br><br>A/N: I&#39;m sorry JayBird!   </p>

            <p>Chapter Seven: Overview of the Apocalypse.<br><br>Disclaimer: I do not own what belongs to other authors.<br><br>The Suetelluvian Celebrian&#39;s victory over her hated rival Laura was only a prelude to a new period of strife between the ancient beings of Glitter. Now that the EPC had been defeated and the NMG was still amassing their forces in preparation for an attack on their Multiverse (as for the NMP, there was yet no word of them after the battle near Celebrian&#39;s tomb), they were now free to contest the rule of the Mirror Multiverse between them. New Sueish servants,created with the smallest fraction of their glitter, were sent as proxies to fight graphic battles for their ancient masters and mistresses.<br><br>It was Celebrian and Ebony Dark&#39;ness Dementia Raven Way who fought the hardest battle, however. Ebony&#39;s bad spelling and the fact that her source fic had more reviews than hers were utterly unforgivable offences for the elf, while the goff considered everything with pointy ears &#39;preppy&#39;.<br><br>The portals between what was once the LOTR and HP worlds were strained to the limit, as armies of Orcs and other animals with absurdly big parts were sent in bulk, only to be killed by powerful fan-made spells that surged through the openings between the dimensions and impacted their staging grounds, including the palace of the Suetelluvian Elleth.<br><br>Depraved Imagination against Depraved Imagination. Canon Defilement versus Canon Defilment. The two Primal Sues were evenly matched, each unable to break the Impasse.<br><br>Then the Hacker who had sabotaged Ebony&#39;s source fic long ago secided to ally herself with Celebrian just to spite Ebony.<br><br>All the Fan-made spells ceased to function, and the Orcish armies surged through the portals. While the Goff!Sues and Stus who served Ebony still had guns, none of them had the firing rate needed to stem a Zerg Rush, even a non-literal one. The preps that were still in Suevian!Hogwarts debated on whether to rejoice in the downfall of their foes, until the orcs grabbed them and put them in bondage.<br><br>The Chamber of Secrets was the last to fall, with the Suetelluvian using the entrance as a chokepoint in a rare display of intelligence. But fall the place did,and Ebony, the Queen of Goffikness, was taken captive, screaming and swearing. <br><br>&quot;... u u fukken prep!1 U will die!&quot; But she was unable to do anything to free herself, and she was taken to her enemy&#39;s lair in the Misty Mountains.<br><br>There were three altars there. Two of them held the Suetelluvian Laura and the Hacker, who was double-crossed by Celebrian shortly after she turned off the Goffik fan-made spells. The third one was empty.<br><br>&quot;Om y fudking Satan! Are you going to rad me?&quot; said Ebony.<br><br>&quot;Of course not. Such a thing is too good for you. No, I am going to sacrifice you, that girl, and the person I just double-crossed to awaken the greatest of the Suetelluvians, and be rewarded with stewardship of the Eternal Suvian Paradise!&quot;<br><br>&quot;NOOO11!!!!&quot; Said Ebony with no regard for spelling and grammar.<br><br>Celebrian laughed...and took out some daggers! </p>

You Lose.&quot;<br><br>Then with another flick of a finger, she ended the Multiverse.</p>

            <p>I actually have the second chapter of a story that the reviews on FfL were updated for, but the chapter itself was never posted. If someone would be kind enough to add it when the site&#39;s updated next, the chapter is here.<br><br><br>Chapter two<br><br>Hehehe I left you all on a cliffie last time!<br><br>Thanks for the nice reviews XxLuminescent-TearsxX and MystikalLuvrrRr because at least its nice to know that some people lke my work unlike some people like that honest critic person who doesn’t know what theyre talking about.<br><br>A/n; I decided that even though Kelvins from lOTr hed know about Star Wars because of working in the PpC so that’s why he knows about Sith and Jedi just in case anybody wonders why.<br><br>Rilwen lunged at Kelvin to kill him because she thought it was all his fault that Cavan was being gay and she didn;t care that he was Kelvins true Love. But Cavan was a Sith like Rilwen and he jumped in front of Kelvin to save him and drew his own lightsaber and he began fighting with Rilwen to make her stop trying to kill them and eventually he beat her and her lightsaber stopped working and Cavan was gong to kill her but he didn;t because Kelvin was there and Kelvins goodness made Cavan feel ashamed of being evil because that’s what Sith are so he put his lightsaber down and told Rilwen “Go away”. “I will let you live but you must never try to harm Kelvin again”. “He is a good person and I love him and you must accept that because you are homosexual yourself”.<br><br>And Rilwen didnt answer but she knew he was right and she ran away crying to find her lover and left them alone. Kelvin sighed in relief and turned to Cavan and gave him a pasionate embrace and whispered “Thank you for saving me”.<br><br>Cavan looked up at him sadly and replied “Your goodness is what made me do it because Im not a good person myself”. “Im a Sith and we are evil but youre so good that I cant be with you because youre too good to love somebody evil”.<br><br>Kelvin was heartbroken bcause he knew Cavan was his one True Love and he didnt want to lose him but he knew Cavan was right so he thought for a while and then he said “I dont want to lose you Cavan but if youre evil then we cant be together but thre is a way for us to be together”. “You can turn to the Light Side of the Force and be a Jedi like Luke Skywalker because he was able to love even though he was a Jedi”.<br><br>And Cavan smiled and said “Yes Ill do that for you and then we can always be together” and he stopped being Sith and came to the Light Side and was a Jedi and then Kelvin was happy because he could finally be together with his True love and they made love together and they were both happy.<br><br>And all the girls who wanted to be with kelvin were sad at first because they knew he could never get with them now but they were happy because he was happy and Kelvin and Cavan were so hot together. And in the end they went up to the Flowers and got transferred so that Kelvin and Cavan were partners and could be together and because they were good they made sure that Rilwen and Lyra were together as well so that they could love each other even though theyd been so mean to them.<br><br>The End‼!11!1‼!<br><br>Please R/r!</p>

Ihave tryd and tryd to get the fanficland to do somthing, but tehy WONT. umm but tahnks for teh comments and i hop you liike this chapterr!<br><br>Burning Watier: hehehe, not in tihs chappie, but mabee teh neckst!<br><br>*-* *-* *-* *-* *-* *-* *-* *-* *-* *-* *-* *-*<br><br>Chapter Three - Dark<br><br>Jaycacia sat up in the darkness without knowing what had awoken her. She felt like she had heard something, but there was no sound in the glade. <i>It&#39;s probably nothing,</i> she thought, and rolled over to put her arm around the SO.<br><br>He wasn&#39;t there.<br><br>Neither was Jay.<br><br>Jaycacia wasn&#39;t worried, of course. She was Jaycacia Thornbyrd, and they were Jay Thorntree and the Sunflower Official. With the power of love, they could overcome any danger. Still, it was best to be sure. She got up and looked around.<br><br>The darkness was deep in this place, lit only by a thin crescent moon. Jaycacia could just make out the tree on which – she smiled at the memory – Jay had carved a picture of her a few hours earlier. She wandered over and brushed her fingers over the wood.<br><br>There was something sticky on the tree. Jaycacia gasped softly and snapped her fingers, using the secret powers given to her at birth by a wandering Daffodil (A/N: Remember that? They were in the first story!) to flood the grove with light.<br><br>There was blood on the tree. Someone had been writing on it. In blood. Jaycacia stared in horror. There was <i>blood</i> on the <i>picture</i>. In thin, spidery letters, it read, <i>All things will end when the Weaver rises</i>. Jaycacia fainted.<br><br>She awoke a moment later, spurred on by her fear for her loved ones. Jaycacia wasn&#39;t used to being afraid – she was strong enough to defeat most dangers – but she overcame it and gathered her thoughts. On the ground were the faint marks of Jay&#39;s and the SO&#39;s feet (A/N: Or should that be roots?), leading off into the forest. There was something else around the footprints... a ring of disturbed earth. Whatever had made the marks must have left the message. That meant it had taken Jaycacia&#39;s lovers captive, and that could not be borne. The young Assassin ran into the forest after them, trusting her sense of the SO&#39;s location to guide her.<br><br>When at last she felt her husband drawing near, Jaycacia stopped, leaning against a tree. Whatever had intruded on their holiday was just around the next corner – she could hear something now, a low humming noise. Carefully she crept to the cliff that formed one side of the road, edged along it, and peered round...<br><br>~<br><br><i>The single sheet of closely-printed paper floated down through the air and landed on Jay Thorntree&#39;s face. She woke with a start, grabbed it, and peered at the first lines. &quot;Oh... bother,&quot; she mumbled. &quot;Where are you, Acy?&quot;<br><br>&quot;If you didn&#39;t have such ridiculously tiny windows, you wouldn&#39;t need to ask,&quot; Acacia&#39;s voice said from across the room. &quot;You know what your problem is? You don&#39;t consider your friends when you make these decisions.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Says the woman who moved to Ancient Rome,&quot; Jay pointed out. She shuffled her feet out of bed and walked to the window.<br><br>&quot;Aquae Sulis now,&quot; Acacia corrected. &quot;My jewellery is a big hit.&quot;<br><br>&quot;The Suethors would be very glad to hear it, except not.&quot; Jay read a few more lines of the sheet of paper Acacia had thrown at her. &quot;Was this really necessary?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I just thought you&#39;d like to see it,&quot; Acacia said, sounding as innocent as she could. &quot;Would you mind opening your door and letting me in? It&#39;s cold out here.&quot;<br><br>&quot;... I&#39;ll think about it,&quot; Jay replied. &quot;Let me read this first...&quot;</i></p>

The Sunflower Official doesn&#39;t have feet. What do you think - that just because the Flowers wear suits and work in offices they suddenly become mammalian? Actually, forget that - it&#39;s too ridiculous a concept to apply logic to in the first place.</p>

It was three weeks later, and she and Dustin were in a diner on the Rue Fait-des-Choses.<br>&quot;I doubt it,&quot; said Dustin.  &quot;K-9 is keeping the secret.

TOUCH HIM AGAIN AND YOU&#39;RE DRAGON STEAK, GOT IT?&quot;<br>&quot;... off, maned ape,&quot; replied Verra.  &quot;I know now I was meant for another dragon.  In fact, I think I&#39;ll eat you right now.&quot;  She demorphed.  Five and Alec bolted.  Not fast enough, though.  Verra caught up with Alec and ate him.<br><br>V&amp;D V&amp;D V&amp;D V&amp;D V&amp;D<br><br>Five of Six got back to the Time And Relative Dimensions In Space machine, currently a telephone pole, and shut the door.</p>

We&#39;ll be meeting at the International Fountain at the Seattle Center around 10:30/11 ish in the morning. As far as I know, this date/time works for everyone. if it doesn&#39;t, please post in this thread.<br><br>Thanks!<br><br>Pretzel</p>

            <p>Speaking as the veteran of two and a half Gatherings (not sure the last one counts, since we all lived in the city at the time), wearing distinctive t-shirts/vests/bags with something recognizable on them seems to be a good strategy. For instance, at the first Chicago Gathering, I had my laptop bag with the potted cactus flash patch I&#39;d silk-screened onto it, and I think Tungsten had her vest with cactus at that time, too. In Bath `09, hS had his sunflower t-shirt, and I had one of mine with &quot;Neshomeh&quot; on the back (and a fairly cool dragon on the front, if I do say so myself). I had the same shirt in the and-a-half Chicago meetup.<br><br>If you&#39;re interested, I have instructions for silk screening in the artist&#39;s comments for my cactus flash patch: <a href="http://neshomeh.deviantart.com/gallery/#/ds7lea"><a href="http://neshomeh.deviantart.com/gallery/#/ds7lea">http://neshomeh.deviantart.com/gallery/#/ds7lea</a></a> It&#39;s pretty simple, but let me know if my instructions aren&#39;t clear enough if you decide to try it. {= )<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I thought it would be entertaining/potentially useful for the mini-milgwyn to have the mon as their matriarch. Perhaps as a result they develope a strange fondness for the Pokémon TCG. Rumor has it that they can be bribed with a holographic Charizard, though as no-one has ever seen one there is no way to test this.</p>

            <p>. . . to say, My God do I miss you guys. :D<br><br>Hi, y&#39;all. *waves* I was a PPCer back in the day--back when GreyLadyBast&#39;s temple wasn&#39;t yet empty and the last of the original duo&#39;s missions were being posted. I ran agents Diocletian and Suicide, adopted the Celebrian-traumatized Elf Ithalond and his wife Mithiriel, and in general screwed around like a doofus. <br><br>I made the decision a couple of years ago to stop writing PPCs because my original stuff was being tempted with a publishing deal. That took a while to happen, but my book officially comes out on the fifteenth, and I&#39;ve been celebrating by doing some evil plotting with Neshomeh. <br><br>Anyway--long mememe post story short--I hope to be back for a while (if the Flowers don&#39;t have the security dandelions chase me off with sticks). I&#39;m going to be lurking for a while on the board, and I&#39;m thrilled to see that the PPC badfic contest is still being done. :)<br><br>So . . . er . . . don&#39;t kill me?</p>

            <p>I posted the info in a reply a little further down the thread---Addendum: the book. In short, though, the title is &quot;Thief of Midnight&quot; and it&#39;s urban fantasy with a bit of horror flavoring. Definitely some PPC influence, too; I can&#39;t seem to get over my love of monster hunters who drink heavily on the job. :D</p>

I spent one year actually writing it, and three years crawling my way through process of agents-editors-agents-editors-publishing house-query-rejection-oh god kill me now.

            <p>Thank you! :) I only did a few missions, so it&#39;s kind of flattering to see that I&#39;m remembered well (or at least not lynched on sight). And I&#39;m glad the board tradition of piling new arrivals with freebies remains, too. XD</p>

            <p>How much has the PPC changed, do you think? (I&#39;m very junior, only been here a few months. In fact, if this weren&#39;t the PPC I probably wouldn&#39;t be allowed to be speaking with you.)<br><br>Also, congratulations on the book! Can I ask what it&#39;s about?

            <p>Not from what I can see so far. The yearly badfic-writing session, pelting new arrivals with tenuously-useful objects--I&#39;m not seeing many differences so far. The only real one is that I&#39;m an oldbie and I don&#39;t know many of y&#39;all, which is a bit weird. Hey, you kids! Get off my lawn!<br><br>Thank you. :) The book is called &quot;Thief of Midnight.&quot; It&#39;s urban fantasy, though it tends towards horror in some places, and set in Chicago. </p>

            <p>Horror? Eep! Is it more &quot;horrible nasty creatures with maggots crawling out of their eyeballs&quot; or &quot;horrible unseen menace that could be anywhere around you&quot;? (I was all set to go read it as soon as it came out, but if it&#39;s the second I don&#39;t think I can handle it.) <br><br>The urban fantasy thing is cool, though. I was actually just writing something on LiveJournal about urban fantasy. It was more about the romantic subgenre, which I doubt is the case, but I&#39;m still curious about whether you&#39;ve got any tips before I post it.</p>

            <p>Don&#39;t worry, I think it falls on the action-adventure side of horror. It&#39;s been reviewed as horror because it contains bogeymen--who are traditionally monsters that do creepy-ass stuff like snatching children. Also, someone gets chomped in the face by a woman without a face. A friend tells me that face-eating is very horroresque.<br><br>I wrote it as urban fantasy, though, so I don&#39;t think you should have any reason to be scared. I&#39;m no good at &quot;horrible unseen menace behind you right now&quot;; I&#39;m afraid all my time with the PPC has conditioned me towards the kind of creeping horrors that can be blown up. :D<br><br>And I don&#39;t write much romantic urban fantasy, but I sure read it. (A friend of mine just turned me on to Kelly Armstrong.) I don&#39;t know what you mean by tips--about writing urban fantasy, or writing the essay, or what? It sounds interesting. :)</p>

            <p>As long as it&#39;s not going to leave me scared to close my eyes in case something teleports into the corner while I&#39;m not looking, I&#39;m interested. Gore is easy. <br><br>As for the essay, it&#39;s basically a list of rules I think all the Twilight knockoffs should follow in the hope that they would then suck less. I was wondering if you could think of anything that should go on the list. I&#39;ve got stuff like no changelings, tell us how the protagonist lived before Mr. Supernatural Hottie came into her life, diversify the mythology, <strike> extract Mr. Supernatural Hottie&#39;s head from his ass </strike> don&#39;t make the male protagonist a haughty, cold, handsome man who is defrosted by the heroine... stuff like that.</p>

            <p>Well, my one cardinal rule for romance is that the characters should exist outside the relationship. I find it&#39;s a good exercise (in my admittedly limited experience) to write short scenes, totally separate from the romance itself, focusing on the hero and heroine each alone. Just hero or heroine, no other half, maybe not even any of the supporting cast. It helps to develop their characters. They need to be individuals who fall in love. Two halves of one soul sounds romantic, and it may work in a fantasy context, but it can get really creepy really quickly if the writer doesn&#39;t know exactly what they&#39;re doing.<br><br>And this may be a stylistic choice, but I think first-time writers should probably avoid first-person POV. It just makes it way too easy to turn the romance into a whiny monologue. Third-person singular gives you all the strength of a viewpoint, including the emotional connection, but prevents chronic Twilitis. (Inflammation of the thesaurus. :D) </p>

            <p>He&#39;s had some computer issues, and a Real Life, and all that. But he&#39;s back enough to have started the Badfic Game. {= )<br><br>Okay. Just e-mail me anything you want included--Suicide&#39;s recruitment, maybe? I think that&#39;s still on your LJ, so I can grab that myself... What I could particularly use, though, is an introductory blurb so the landing page isn&#39;t just the list of missions. I was gonna steal the first paragraph of the first mission, but I am reluctant because the conditions described therein change over the course of the series. But, however you like, since you&#39;re actually around to have a say. {= )<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Damn real life. Keeps getting in the way of the important stuff! *shakes fist*<br><br>As for stuff for the website--actually, I was thinking of tweaking the story of Suicide&#39;s recruitment. I wrote it as an exercise a while back, and I&#39;m not happy now with the timeline it sets up. I&#39;m reluctant to retcon it entirely, but I think I need to mess with it a little. Can we consider that one semi-non-canon for now?<br><br>I can write you an introductory blurb, no problem. :)<br><br>And yessss, the badfic game.

The expanded area of appeal of Twilight is actually a scary concept-- it shows us that far more than &#39;losers&#39; carry this &#39;loser&#39; behavior.)<br><br>Really, there&#39;s very litle difference between the two demographics, save social &#39;acceptability&#39;.

            <p>You know how, on the front page of the Wiki, there are Featured Agents, right?<br><br>OK. Well, much as we all love FicPsych (and I do, really), I think it&#39;d be good if we put other agents up there. (I&#39;ve pitched this idea on the Talk page, but wanted to discuss it properly.)<br><br>I suggest that any agent who finishes his fifth recorded mission should be automatically put up as the featured agent. It&#39;s a little like being a WWII ace, after all--survive five missions, and you&#39;re a legend. Or a semi-insane Bleeprin-addicted survivor, which is about the same thing.<br><br>Also, to avoid skipping agents when a writer writes five missions with more than a single pair of agents, one or more of that writer&#39;s agents ought to be nominated, just so it&#39;s fair.

            <p>With one caveat: let us not take this to mean that everyone should be striving to post lots of missions just to get featured. I prefer one really good mission over several mediocre ones any time, so there should definitely be room to nominate agents simply for being really well-written and, dare I say, cool.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I don&#39;t think there&#39;s too much danger of people just putting down five mediocre missions; by the time you get to five, there&#39;s at least some dedication involved; and anyway, would you really want to be known for writing so-so missions? The logical approach would be to wait until you had five good ones to &quot;publish&quot;.</p>

            <p>So, I was reading the article on quarantined continuums on the wiki, and saw that Terry Goodkind&#39;s Sword of Truth series was under quarantine (horrible series, IMHO, but whatever floats your boat), and was wondering:  Do badfics in the tv&#39;verse of the book series count as being in violation of the quarantine?  Or is <i>Legend of the Seeker</i> so different from the book series that it&#39;s not the same thing? (I know that in the opening credits of each episode, it says &quot;Based on the Sword of Truth series&quot;, but...)<br>I was wondering because I found a coupla badfics, and wanted to know.<br>(some of the badfics underneath)<br>-<a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5693133/1/The_Warrior"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5693133/1/The_Warrior">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5693133/1/The_Warrior</a></a>;  Author&#39;s summary: Formerly known as &quot;Warrior Rose&quot;. Rated T, just in case. AU Story. After the defeat of Darken Rahl, Richard, Kahlan, and Zedd reunite with someone who they thought was lost forever. But, this reunion also brings with it new challenges. Please R and R!<br>    Basically, the author is ramming a prophecy, a &quot;long-lost sibling&quot;, and a Mary-Sue down the reader&#39;s throat.  It also has (IMO) stilted writing, badly written prose, and a horrible/non-existent plot.  At least the spelling and grammar are up to par.<br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5908821/1/Rowan_Ahexil"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5908821/1/Rowan_Ahexil">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5908821/1/Rowan_Ahexil</a></a><br>Author&#39;s Summary:  Rowan Ahexil is a rare woman indeed, for she holds a power like no other. She holds the power to revive souls from the underworld, without the requirement of a body. That plus she IS Darken Rahl&#39;s oldest and most trusted companion. DROC<br>My comments:  I hope you have a strong stomach.  There are bad!fics, and then there are these. I can stomach bad!fic, but not (badly written) schmaltzy romances with Mary-Sues, eye-gouging spelling/grammar errors, and more descriptions of the author&#39;s pet character than the setting.  Normally I wouldn&#39;t say this, but... Hades, do I feel sorry for Darken Rahl.<br>-Honu_Wahine</p>

            <p>If the author owns the TV series, and has set up a &quot;no fanfic&quot; rule, then the TV series is also quarantined and you would be bounced straight back into your RC if you tried to portal in.<br><br>However, if the author does not own the TV series (having presumably sold the story to the producers), and the producers of the TV series do not forbid fan fiction, then the continuum is not quarantined.<br><br>Depending on how violently opposed to fan fiction the author is, and how close the TV series is to the original, you may (as an author) choose not to write fan fiction even though the author does not own the TV series. (I haven&#39;t researched Goodkind&#39;s exact opinions on fan fiction; I suggest you do and find out whether it&#39;s more of a &quot;I worked hard on this canon and I don&#39;t want people destroying it with horrible writing and total absence of respect&quot;, or, &quot;No fanfiction. Ever. It&#39;s the bane of my life, I hate fan authors, and I will sue your butt to Hades and back.&quot; If it&#39;s the latter, probably polite to stay away from the TV series too.)<br><br>Be careful working in &quot;Legend of the Seeker&quot;; if the Richard Rahl in that series is anything like the one in the books, you&#39;ll have to keep your sunglasses on to avoid being blinded by the glitter.</p>

            <p>1) Nation, to my knowledge, isn&#39;t a Discworld book. So that would explain a lot.<br><br>2) I did the EXACT same thing - first Tiffany, then CoM, and I was just as confused as you. Having read more, in <i> The Color of Magic </i> the whole idea of Discworld is still sort of... gestating; it hasn&#39;t really taken the form that it&#39;s famous for. As you get further along, they start to seem more in-sync, and even before it all reaches its most famous form (if you read in the order of publication), characters you&#39;ll recognize starts showing up. Granny Weatherwax shows up as early as <i> Equal Rites </i>, which is only the third one. A couple books after that it starts to seem more like the Discworld Tiffany lives in.<br><br>3) I&#39;m reading them in pretty much publishing order, which I&#39;d recommend. I read <i> Monstrous Regiment </i> immediately after <i> Guards! Guards! </i>, and since a lot of characters and innovations are added in between books, it was quite surreal.<br><br>So, anyway, sorry to boss your ear off. I hope you got something useful out of it.</p>

            <p>So, in order of publication (but not necessarily chronological order), the books run thusly:<br><br>1. The Colour of Magic (1983)<br>2. The Light Fantastic (1986)<br>3. Equal Rites (1987)<br>4. Mort (1987)<br>5. Sourcery (1988)<br>6. Wyrd Sisters (1988)<br>7. Pyramids (1989)<br>8. Guards! Guards! (1989)<br>9. Eric (1990)<br>10. Moving Pictures (1990)<br>11.

            <p>certainly, there are the History Monks in both, in multiple times, but what&#39;s-his-face, the protagonist of Thief of Time isn&#39;t in Night Watch, and so I got the impression that these monks, who live a long time (albeit not necessarily linearly) were simply at a different point in their own timeline.  And if you don&#39;t read Thief of Time before Night Watch, it lessens the cohesion and comprehensibility of Night Watch.

            <p>Small Gods took place a significant time before the other books, seeing as how Oats in Carpe Jugulum seems to act as if it was long(ish) ago- I got the impression (without, admittedly, any hard evidence) that Brutha was long-dead by the time Oats trained. <br><br>That said, Small Gods doesn&#39;t really affect any of the other books (excepting Carpe Jugulum) so I guess it&#39;s timeline could be pretty fluid.

            <p>As far as I can tell, the PPC&#39;s civil war doesn&#39;t have any work done on it yet. It could be a project for someone who wants to write about PPC history, or could have been already claimed by someone. If anyone knows more about it, please do post here; I&#39;m curious, too.<br><br>The only thing I can find that actually covers this time period is &quot;Origins&quot;; and it doesn&#39;t mention the civil war:<br><a href="http://www.freewebs.com/bonsaimallorn3/Origins.htm">Origins</a><br><br>I think I will do what I do best: Engage in rampant speculation.<br><br>We know that the Civil War happened about ten years before the Cascade (the expansion of HQ) and before the destruction of Origin.<br><br>Significant facts that may play into the civil war:<br><br>--&quot;A Trekkie&#39;s Tale&quot;, and the Mary Sue concept, was written in 1973; and fan fiction was becoming much more popular as fanzines were published. At this point, World One became widely aware of the Mary Sue problem. The workload would have increased for PPC agents, who at that point may or may not still have been primarily Flowers.<br><br>--At the time Makes-Things dropped into the PPC, the Flowers were still routinely blowing up worlds that harbored Mary Sues and their attendant wild plot holes. We also know that, at some point, they stopped doing this; and that today, killing a canon character is grounds for decommissioning.<br><br>With the increased workload, the PPC must have tried to kill more Sues, faster, somehow. Chances are, more and more planets were simply destroyed. But at the same time, with World One having found out about Mary Sues, an increasing number of human agents would have been dropping through plot holes and into HQ. The human agents can&#39;t have been happy about the destructive nature of the PPC&#39;s shortcuts to &#39;Sue destruction.<br><br>The result was an organization with two groups of people who had different goals: The Flowers, protecting their own existence; and the agents, protecting the continua they loved. How Origin and its residents factored in is unknown; it&#39;s likely that the Sunflower Official, probably along with some of the other Flowers at HQ, was also against the destruction of worlds. With Makes-Things&#39;s new technology making it possible (but risky) <i>not</i> to destroy worlds, the SO must have tried to change things. That would have created serious tension between the SO and anyone who didn&#39;t want to protect the continua--quite likely including mostly those who hadn&#39;t ever seen them, i.e., the residents of Origin.<br><br>Just blowing things up was an easy option, of course; but it weakened the continuum even as it prevented plot holes from spreading. But surgically removing the Mary Sue is risky because the escape of a Sue into HQ could theoretically spell the doom of all of existence. The question, &quot;Do we destroy worlds, and save ourselves? Or do we risk everything to save the continua?&quot; may well have contributed to a civil war; though like most civil wars, it&#39;s highly unlikely that that was the only issue facing the PPC at that point.</p>

            <p>It&#39;s not entirely (well, very much at all) correct, but I do like it. No, the conflict at the heart of the Civil War is deeper than the question of how to destroy &#39;Sues -- it&#39;s whether the Flowers should be mucking about with plotholes at all. Everyone you know who was around at that time said they should. As to what happened to those who disagreed... well, if I told you <i>that</i>, there&#39;d be no story, would there?<br><br>(There isn&#39;t a story involving the Civil War yet, but it <i>is</i> planned in for Origins, once that gets written.

            <p>A bit off-topic, but who knows LOTR canon better than you people? Someone asked me today where dragons come from. Some people say they&#39;re Maiar, but they apparently breed, so I&#39;m not sure how that works. I can&#39;t think of anything in middle-earth that could be turned into a dragon, though.<br><br>This led me to the question of where trolls come from.

            <p>I don&#39;t remember, but off the top of my head, I think Melkor/Morgoth created dragons. At the least, they are Always Chaotic Evil. Same with trolls, if I recall-- they were made, by the &quot;pale imitation&quot; thing. Made as originals by Melkor/Morgoth, but only by copying Ents.</p>

            <p>... that since Melkor could never create actual life (only Iluvatar can do that - see Aule and the dwarves as proof), they have to be either a) corrupted something-elses, b) Maiar, or c) mere extensions of Morgoth&#39;s or Sauron&#39;s will.<br><br>Trolls seem a little too common to be Maiar, and apparently act of their own accord. Might they be corrupted <a href="http://www.glyphweb.com/ARDA/s/stonegiants.html">Stone Giants</a> (see The Hobbit)? Tolkien also mentioned &#39;Tree-giants&#39; seen in the Shire, so the Ent=Giant connection is there. If Melkor took Stone Giants and twisted them, giving them a form of intelligence in exchange for somewhat reduced stature, might that account for them? I suspect Yavanna was quite ticked off to see her own creation mocked by creatures made of stone - her husband&#39;s domain.<br><br>That would allow trolls to breed, but what about dragons? Tolkien&#39;s dragons come in four combinations: fire-breathing and not, flying and not. Glaurung was fire-breathing but not flying. The <a href="http://www.glyphweb.com/ARDA/c/colddrakes.html">Cold-drakes</a> were non-fire-breathing, but some could fly. Smaug and Ancalagon could do both. The Cold-drakes, at least, seem to have bred true, but it&#39;s entirely possible that Smaug himself was created by Morgoth. Certainly he is described as the last great Fire-drake. If this is the case, might (and I&#39;m theorising completely here) Cold-drakes have been either pre-Melkor, or some form of corrupted snake, while Fire-drakes, being more powerful and having an unnatural ability, were Maiar in built shells, like Balrogs? Of course, their bodies could well have been &#39;built&#39; by twisting something pre-existing anyway...<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Perhaps they were their own pre-existing species, created along with the animals and suchlike, and all Morgoth did was make them sentient? Technically, that&#39;s just changing life into different life... And I harbor the theory that life = sentience anyway. Did you know that even paramecia have personalities? -cough- Anyway.<br><br>Since we&#39;re on this topic, what about the fell-beasts? I&#39;d assumed that they were twisted Eagles (poor Eagles T.T), but since they appear to be mammalian (bat-wings), that doesn&#39;t really work.<br><br>On the other hand, if they&#39;re a reptilian species, that makes a lot more sense, since birds are descended from reptiles. But then again, if Eagles are the servants of Manwë, could you even do that to them? I&#39;ve always been sort of confused as to their status--are they living creatures who just happen to be considered representative of Manwë and are occasionally messengers, or are they some sort of spirit-avatar-thing and not actually a sentient species? I&#39;d think they&#39;d get a mention in the Ent song, if that were true, unless it&#39;s being specist. Of course only the <i>humanoid</i> species get a song...<br><br>...Yeah.

            <p>That was my thought.

I&#39;ve been using it to mean self-aware. No one&#39;s ever corrected me, but now that I look, it seems I&#39;ve been using the science fiction definition (and there appear to be several others).

            <p>I was looking through the DMS section of the list, and there are quite a few Divisions that only have one or two missions, a lot of them are for pretty rare fandoms. I had the idea that some consolidation might make sense to make the page look neater. I&#39;m looking specifically at:<br><br>Group 1: Labyrinth, Legacy of Kain, Pride and Prejudice, Sci-fi/Steampunk, Shadowlands, Tamora Pierce, Troy, and Valdemar/Mercedes Lackey. About half of the links are broken in this group.<br><br>    * What would the general opinions be of possibly moving missions from this first group to the Sub-Department of Rare Fandoms? <br><br>    * We could maintain their identity by making them Divisions of the Sub-Department. That might work well for most of the items in the next group as well. Something could remain a division of rare fandoms until it reached a significant number of missions. Maybe five? Then be made its own division. This would cover agents like Tasmin and Allison, remaining in the Sub-Department, because they take on all sorts of rare fandoms, whereas these other agents only take whatever they are labeled as. <br><br>Group 2: Bleach, The Matrix, Narnia, Phantom of the Opera, Wheel of Time, and X-Men. This group seems to be more popular/common in terms of quantity of fanfic or with current Boarders, or they still have active agents and might therefore grow. I&#39;m just pointing out that they also have a lot of broken links and not very many missions listed. Bleach and Full Metal Alchemist (which does have more than five missions) could both go in as sub-divisions under Anime/Manga.<br><br>    * Basically, I am wondering if we could limit the Divisions to things that have a large quantity of fanfic, or more than one or two pairs of agents, or more than five missions. I kind of like the idea of sub-divisions in such a large department as DMS. It looks all organized and professional and stuff. ;) <br><br><br>   --Two more things--<br><br>1. While speaking of divisions, the All-Purpose Department is pretty much all about being divided up by what continuum the agents work, would it be okay to actually label them? I think Echo Kazul and Kat Daydream worked Star Wars, and Brightbeard and Barid are in Warcraft? I admit to mostly selfish reasons for asking this, as I am about to move Kelok and Unger to the Sherlock Holmes division of the All-Purpose Department. <br><br>2. Black Jewels is a quarantined continuum now. What would you all think about relabeling it to something like &quot;Historical reports from now Quarantined continua&quot; or something like that, just so it is obvious that we only have that mission listed because it was okay when it was written, and if any other missions are found that fall in that category, we could group them all together. </p>

            <p>We could reduce the large number of categories on the list if we had headings like this--<br><br><b>DMS Divisions (Fantasy)</b><br>Agents Joe and John (Mossflower) (3)<br>Agents Alice and Bob (Narnia) (2)<br>Agents Zoe and Wilbur (Wheel of Time) (1)<br><br>So the DMS would be divided into divisions as usual (no changes there), and then on the complete list everything would be actually listed by genre, with the specific continuum in parentheses after the agents&#39; names and just before their mission number.</p>

            <p>I really like that. Nothing is changed internally, but the page looks much neater. It also helps label things that I am not familiar with.

            <p>Putting the Complete List page into a more concise format is for the sake of people looking for spinoffs.

            <p>Consolidation would be a good idea, if only to keep the list read-able. The thing is, in my mind, that we&#39;ve got two ways to officially divide everything: The way we percieve it here in the real world, and the way that things work within the Word World. Just because we Boarders don&#39;t write a lot in one department doesn&#39;t mean that it&#39;d be a snall department within the PPC, so I&#39;m wary of lumping a number of fandoms together under an official label and acting like it would be normal in HQ. Then again, there&#39;s nothing to say it wouldn&#39;t be. I&#39;m just careful.<br><br>In response to your other questions:<br><br>1. Sure, why not? If we can have a hundred little subdivisions in one area, why not another? Besides, it&#39;s easier to say that an agent &quot;belongs to the Sherlock Holmes division of the All-Purpose Department&quot; than to say that they &quot;belong to the All-Purpose Department but specialise in/only take on missions from the Sherlock Holmes continuum&quot;. It means the same thing anyway, an if there&#39;s one thing to be said about the PPC, it&#39;s that we don&#39;t fuss about giving things fancy names. The shortest and simplest will do.<br><br>2. I don&#39;t see why not; that sounds like the most tactful solution for everybody. :)</p>

            <p>I completely understand what your saying about it being different between how HQ sees it and how we see it. I kind of got lost in that long post, and forgot part of my point, but I think I was aiming in that direction with dividing those up into two groups.

            <p>I think it was their fifth mission when  Tasmin said that in A-Team division they did everything.<br><br>That&#39;s a little beside the point. <br><br>Point would be that number of missions written shouldn&#39;t be the measure of whether something should be in the sub-department of Rare Fandoms, because there have been more missions into A-Team than into Doctor Who or Torchwood, and the former is sub-department of Rare Fandoms, and the other two aren&#39;t. It should be a consideration of the number of badfic (absolute or relative to the number of fic in the fandom) that makes the fandom rare. </p>

            <p>The problem I see here is one of practicality. Not all - few, in fact - agents are going to be knowledgeable about all those continua. For example, I (and therefore any agents I write) am familiar with Narnia, The Matrix, Phantom of the Opera and Pride and Prejudice (and others, but sticking to what&#39;s on your list for now). They can&#39;t simply be placed in any of the below divsions because they just don&#39;t know all the fandoms. They have to be restricted to continua they know. I don&#39;t think there&#39;s any way to class fandoms in such a way as to ensure that every agent who knows one of them will know all.</p>

            <p>We have an Anime division; and that&#39;s an absolutely huge category.<br><br>I&#39;ve only read one mission in which neither agent was familiar with the fandom (a DOA mission to Fullmetal Alchemist). It makes sense to assume that Upstairs catalogs all the agents&#39; known fandoms--they catalog lust objects; quite probably this is done at the same time--and assigns missions to teams where one or both agents know the fandom. It&#39;s probably in the computer system somewhere. (The Agent wiki template also includes a Fandoms entry; we in the Real World keep track of them too.)<br><br>After all, Floaters, DMS-Freelance, and DBS-Freelance agents can&#39;t possibly know every continuum out there; and yet they could technically be given everything from Shakespeare to Teletubbies.<br><br>Putting agents into departments based on their favorite genres makes sense: If you&#39;re going into Star Wars and you&#39;ve got to have a partner who doesn&#39;t know the canon, would you want someone who knows Star Trek and Animorphs, or someone who&#39;s only got experience in Sherlock Holmes and Pride and Prejudice? Group &#39;em by genre, and the agent who doesn&#39;t know the canon is more likely to actually be useful.<br><br>Agents with eclectic lists are probably going to be assigned to Floaters/Freelance. And agents who only know one canon (badfic recruits, especially) tend to get put wherever there are manpower shortages. And there are exceptions to every rule; this is HQ after all... But in general, I&#39;d think that if you wanted to execute Sues, grouping by genre makes more sense because you&#39;d know the rules of plot in that genre even if you didn&#39;t know the particular canon...</p>

            <p>But I think that because, as you say, the computer system keeps track of who can do what, there wouldn&#39;t therefore be any real reason to make a lot of subdivisions; my agents are in DMS Freelance and I&#39;m quite happy to leave it that way.</p>

            <p>It&#39;s not been bumped off the first page yet, but it&#39;s buried under so many gigantic threads it may as well have fallen down the Mariana Trench.<br><br>Agents:<br><br>Name: Summerblaze (Summer)<br>Species: Human<br>Home Continuum: Valdemar<br>Department: Department of Mary-Sues<br>Background: The offspring of a Sue and a Darkwind!Possession-Stu, Summer was created with virtually no personality, and pretty much ignored except for sicky-sweet bits of fluff. The PPC interrupted the fic when she was about five years old, but not having any charges on her except for parentage, they took her back to the PPC Nursery (after a jaunt through the science center, where they attempted therapy to remove as much Glitter as possible). She was &quot;adopted&quot; by another Tayledras agent, and essentially grew up in the PPC HQ. Due to her parentage, she has a mild case of MSS, but not quite as bad as a full-blown Rehabilitated!Sue.<br>Skills: Mind-to-mind communication with her bondbird, mental shielding, (momentary) physical shielding, small fireballs<br>Weapons: Tayledras climbing pick; longbow<br>Appearance: Her parents may have been Suvians, but the author at least paid attention to genetics. Her hair is black (at certain times of the month it becomes &quot;glossy, raven locks&quot; and/or &quot;onyx tresses&quot;) and waist-length; on missions, she generally ties it into a pony-tail or braid. Her skin is golden-brown, the laws of Narrative Comedy having been lenient for once, as even in canon the Tayledras are simply described as &quot;golden-skinned.&quot; She is fairly tall and athletic, although without Suvian influences her figure is about as average as it gets. She is perfectly fine with this, and wouldn&#39;t have it any other way.<br><br>Name: James Ochre Yellow (Jamie, Oke)<br>Species: Human (Ex-Piper&#39;s Child)<br>Home Continuum: Keys to the Kingdoms (The Lower House)<br>Department: DoM-S<br>Background: A Piper&#39;s Child of unknown ancestry, Jaime was running from an Overseer after stealing a pair of wings when he fell into HQ. No one&#39;s really sure how; it was put down to a plothole. An accident with a Mage!Sue caused the wings (he&#39;d worked /hard/ to steal those. He wasn&#39;t just gonna leave &#39;em in a closet) to attach themselves permanently to his back, which, while occasionally convenient, can also be incredibly annoying, as they have a mind of their own and tend to snap out at inopportune times. (The process of turning a magical construct into a pair of flesh-and-blood appendages was also excruciatingly painful, and remains a source of spontaneous agony. Mammals were not meant to possess six limbs, and the Word World occasionally decides to recognize this fact.)<br>Skills: Flight<br>Weapons: Whatever heavy object is nearest; decent hand at just about everything, but not particularly good at any one thing.<br>Appearance: James is quite clearly of mixed blood. His longish hair is sandy brown and usually messy; occasionally he ties it into a stubby ponytail when it starts to get in the way. His eyes are medium brown, and his skin is tan; in short, his coloring is what one might expect of a European, but his build is more like the stereotypical Asian, and his almond-shaped eyes and nonexistent epicanthic fold only emphasize the look. He is a rather mature-looking fifteen, easily mistaken for a college student.<br><br>Writing sample:<br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/u/1648576/"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/u/1648576/">http://www.fanfiction.net/u/1648576/</a></a> My page in the Pit, although it&#39;s mostly serious stuff, and since I haven&#39;t posted there in ages my writing style&#39;s changed. I&#39;m working on a sample with these two, but I figure as of now, might as well post what I&#39;ve got, eh?<br><br>First badfic: <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6094334/1/The_Life_of_Rosanna_Hathaway_Potter"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6094334/1/The_Life_of_Rosanna_Hathaway_Potter">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6094334/1/The_Life_of_Rosanna_Hathaway_Potter</a></a> I don&#39;t normally read this fandom, but it&#39;s such a god-awful frightfest that I couldn&#39;t resist. Warning: The whole thing is written in bold/italic. THE. WHOLE. THING.<br><br>Because this came up in the first post, I&#39;d assumed that there had been more than one batch of Piper&#39;s Children, given the number of them in the House. Also, with regards to parentage, James isn&#39;t necessarily half-Asian, half-European. I didn&#39;t figure out an exact ratio, but it&#39;s not impossible for a European to have a stereotypically Asian build, and Asian genes tend to be dominant over European ones in mixed-race offspring. There was Asian influence in Britain at some point in history, though I forget when; it&#39;s almost entirely faded now, but he&#39;s from a time period when it would have been much stronger.<br><br>Also, until I come up with a better idea, I&#39;ve decided that he&#39;s the descendant--grand or great-grandchild, most likely--of a European merchant who married an Asian woman who he met on his travels. It&#39;s not entirely implausible or uncommon; Indo-European trade has an extremely long history. It&#39;s not going to affect the writing in any way whatsoever, but it&#39;s nice to have it.</p>

            <p>Both your agents look good, and at least from the fandoms I know (FMA-kinda and Death Note), your writing samples are really good.<br><br>One quick question, though - if Summer is using magic, is it going to bleach her hair?</p>

            <p>Your agents seem interesting, and although I know none of your fandoms, your writing seems sound. I&#39;m going to ask people I know who know about anime to have a look at your fics, but I am leaning towards granting Permission :) Give me a couple of days to get the final checks done and I&#39;ll let you know my final verdict.<br><br>(NB: Having read one of your fics, I&#39;m pleased to say it was very interesting despite my not knowing the fandom!)</p>

            <p>I don&#39;t know a thing about the fandoms your agents are from. I have no idea what works there and what doesn&#39;t, so I can&#39;t really say anything except that they seem to have a lot of special powers between them, which makes me raise an eyebrow.<br><br>Sorry.<br><br>~Neshomeh, nonplussed.</p>
