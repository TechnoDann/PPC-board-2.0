            <p>With most people away on nano duty, I thought it be nice to have a discussion.<br><br>Or rather, there is something I want to share and I&#39;m sure people are going to disagree and want to put in there two cents (et presto: discussion).<br><br>I&#39;ll start being saying that I rarely read romance stories, whether they be het or slash. I&#39;m just not interested in them. My knowledge of what are common tropes in romance stories comes from <a href="http://localhost:3000/posts/scrape/2010/community.livejournal.com/fanficrants">fanficrants</a>. One of these tropes is that a love-relationship is not complete without a baby. This goes for both het and slash pairings. I&#39;m not here to bash on Mpreg. My issue is with the trope that a relationship is not complete without a baby.<br><br>It struck me, that the notion that even two people of the same gender should have a baby together, is a bit homophobic. I mean, &quot;you and me and baby makes three&quot; is a heterosexual norm. Forcing a heterosexual norm on homosexuals is homophobic (forcing a heterosexual norm on heterosexuals isn&#39;t nice either).<br><br>I know most of these authors think babies make for perfect happiness and they only want to make their characters happy. But why is their subliminal message that a relationship can&#39;t be happy unless it meets some (arbitrary) heterosexual norm?<br><br>Thoughts?</p>

Some people want to get married-- good for them. Some people believe marriage is a conspiracy by the Church to trick guys into being figuratively gelded, but still want a monogamous, loving relationship with kids. Some people are polyamorous. Some people are asexual, but have the desire to raise a child. Some people are monogamous and more-or-less straight, but don&#39;t have any strong feelings one way way or the other about children (hi!).<br><br>The sooner our society grows the hell up and realizes that, the sooner we can stop witch-hunting everything that doesn&#39;t fit the given plot-points of The Perfect Relationship, and learn to live and let live.

            <p>There are pairings where it would make total sense for the guys in question to want a kid, whether by adoption, mpreg, or surrogacy. Some guys canonically like kids and wouldn&#39;t be happy without a few of their own eventually. Others are blatantly unsuited, and then it&#39;s not good, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s particularly worse than giving a kid to fantastically unsuitable straight couples. Saying <em>any</em> relationship needs a baby is wrong, but there are some that do and some that don&#39;t. <br><br>(And, in fact, same-sex couples do have various means of acquiring a baby, depending on location.)</p>

            <p>As I see it, romance stories always seek an &quot;end&quot; - something that will &#39;guarantee&#39; that the couple will continue to live Happily Ever After once the screen has faded to black and the book cover has closed. In many cases this means a wedding - look at how many movies, particularly children&#39;s movies, end with a wedding. Having a child tends to be treated in the same way, at least by most of the fanfic writers I&#39;ve read. The point that either a wedding or a child does not by any means make it certain that the couple will be happy together forever is not, apparently, relevant.<br><br>I also think that many fanfic writers accept the &#39;norm&#39; of a Happy Marriage requiring a child simply because they have internalised it as the way every life goes, even if that&#39;s not true; barring infertility or some other angst-worthy (they think) obstacle, I imagine a lot of the thought processes involved are less along the lines of &quot;would these two characters be the kind to want to have and raise a child?&quot; and more like, &quot;why not? Everyone does!&quot; And thus even couples who are in no position to sensibly choose to have a family (characters who are criminals, for example, always on the run or whatnot) end up being written as doing so anyway, because it&#39;s &#39;the norm&#39;.<br><br>I don&#39;t think the gender of the pairings actually has anything to do with it. Ficcers are a persistant bunch; the only obstacle they seem to face with slash pairings is that they can&#39;t use the convenient &quot;accidental pregnancy&quot; plot device - and even that, they get around. Personally, I read het romance, and avoid slash, but I don&#39;t see any homophobia in the &quot;one and one is three&quot; notion - just biology, and rather naive perceptions of what real romantic relationships are actually like. <br><br>There&#39;s my two cents :)</p>

            <p>I still don&#39;t see it as a homophobic thing to do, even by accident, but more just a social norm that is being applied, and our society is heavily heterosexual in terms of norms. I completely and utterly agree that one can&#39;t treat people qually in different circumstances, but I think it&#39;s just as unfair to blame members of the society for applying its norms within that society, regardless of demopgraphics. <br><br>As a parallel example, one could just as well criticise the makers of coloured contact lenses for not considering that people with very dark eyes won&#39;t be able to use said lenses the way that people with very pale eyes can (or at all, really) - no one can change their eye colour, and regardless of whether an equal amount of people have light blue eyes as dark brown, coloured contacts will continue to be manufactured for and used by those people with pale eyes - they&#39;re fashion, and people who can follow a fashion often do. Those people may then go and write a story including an offhand reference to a character using coloured contacts. Is that wrong, just because a dark-brown-eyed writer or character can&#39;t use them? Could it be called colour-phobic? Or is it just something that happens and that can be annoying and even upsetting, but is nonetheless neither wrong nor right?<br><br>(I really shouldn&#39;t be getting into this discussion - I&#39;m one of the people doing NaNo!)</p>

            <p>One must consider that in more civilized countries (hint hint :P) homosexual couples can adopt or have children in other ways, so I don&#39;t see it as strictly a heterosexual norm.<br><br>I don&#39;t think that the trope itself is really sensible. Until a point, I suppose a large family had benefits such as the parents having people to take care of them when they got older.

            <p>Well, I don&#39;t think that is really the intended message, altough I&#39;ll admit I might be wrong as I generally avoid romance stories. I too really dislike it when heterosexual norms are forced on either heterosexual or homosexual couples. (Stereotypes! Argh!) I think that the reason the authors add babies is the &quot;aww factor&quot; or because they want the readers to be able to relate to the family (and also, by abiding to norms that have been successful in other stories, they try to make their own stories successful). But of course, the intent of the author varies from person to person.</p>

            <p>Normally, I&#39;d agree. Sodomy is, in my opinion and that of every sane person, one of the sickest sexual deviations imaginable. <i>Any</i> piece of writing depicting it as a happy good thing should be shot on sight, and then some. The Hedgehog Song, however, should be taken as the totally, <i>totally</i> over the top dirty ditty it is. It&#39;s the funny rhymes that count. I mean, come on, snails? Whales? Snakes? Bats? Dude. Seriously. I really don&#39;t think the people who wrote their own versions of the song would ever condone such things. As stated above, I sure as hell wouldn&#39;t.<br><br>Try thinking of it that way. I hope you&#39;ll feel better.</p>

            <p>I was labouring under the impression that the definition of &#39;sodomy&#39; as &#39;consensual heterosexual or homosexual intercourse&#39; had gone completely obsolete decades ago. I thought it was only used nowadays when speaking of bestiality.<br><br>I can totally see why you were offended. I&#39;d have offended <i>myself</i> to no end if that was what I&#39;d meant. Those forms of sex are so common as to practically <i>be</i> vanilla. It&#39;s amazing how misunderstandings can wreck things between people.<br><br>Oh, and you were right about the fanfic author thing. I seem to recall stumbling across a badfic on GAFF that featured Jennifer Love Hewitt (yes, a real person!), a horse, and an <i>elephant</i>. Yeeeeaaaaahhhh... Sure. Say it with me: &quot;That!

            <p>So, this person explains the problem far better than I can:<br><a href="http://transfinite.dreamwidth.org/215469.html"><a href="http://transfinite.dreamwidth.org/215469.html">http://transfinite.dreamwidth.org/215469.html</a></a><br><br>I am female and happy being so, but chose not to specify my gender when I joined dA because I don&#39;t feel it&#39;s any random passerby&#39;s business. Telling people when you choose to is one thing, but being forced to show personal info like that (apparently the &quot;hide&quot; option isn&#39;t working, on top of the other problems) is just creepy. Accounts made before this policy came in are still not showing gender on the profile, which is good, but anyone making a new account has to specify.<br><br>I&#39;m not leaving dA because all the stuff I want to use is still there and the only other options I can find suck, but I was thinking of setting up some kind of petition. Anyone know how to do that?</p>

            <p>&quot;Bless me, Fiction, for I have sinned. It has been three years since my last confession.&quot;<br><br>I am azarath1991, also known as the Guy With the Gun, also known as Kyle. I am a long-time fanfiction writer, and my fandoms include (but are not limited to) Alien, Predator, District 9, Teen Titans, Inuyasha, and H.P. Lovecraft. I came across the PPC quite by accident, when browsing TVTropes.org. I was instantly struck by the brilliance of such a concept; an organization devoted to the maintenance of canon.<br><br>However, this also drew from me a feeling of self-revulsion; for until 2007 (when I began writing &quot;serious&quot; fanfic), the fan-works I had produced (but had thankfully never published) many shocking works of badfic.<br><br>My sins include: Self-Insertion into the Firefly, Animorphs, and Lord of the Rings canons, the creation of at least one Marty Stu, and (wait for it) the introduction of a Drow to the Lord of the Rings canon. (Le Gasp!)<br><br>As I have previously noted, most of these works have never graced the world wide interwebz, save for one: a little gem of a crossover called &quot;Alien vs Serenity&quot;.<br><br>Yes. Yes, I did.<br><br>The piece is seventy-four pages long, and is in loose screenplay format. The grammar is okay, but... well, I had only seen &quot;Alien vs Predator&quot;, and the powerloader scene from &quot;Aliens&quot;, and &quot;Serenity&quot; (I had not seen even a single episode of &quot;Firefly&quot;).<br><br>This script is... bad. Really bad. Everybody&#39;s out of character, I inserted myself, and I even named the character Eomir (simply because the films had recently come out, and Karl Urban is by role model).<br><br>This being said, I am interested in becoming an agent for the PPC, but I cannot accept a position until somebody... anybody... has entered this story and *destroyed* it.<br><br>You can find it here:<br><br><a href="http://www.simplyscripts.com/scripts/A_V_S-Draft_One.pdf"><a href="http://www.simplyscripts.com/scripts/A_V_S-Draft_One.pdf">http://www.simplyscripts.com/scripts/A_V_S-Draft_One.pdf</a></a></p>

            <p>Thanks for the warm reception, guys, and all the gifts (especially the Skullcrusher). I&#39;m quite relieved to know so many of you yearn for redemption as I do. In regards to killing my own fic, I don&#39;t feel confident enough to do thus. However, I believe I would maybe be able to kill something on the unclaimed page. So, perhaps someone can add &quot;Alien Vs Serenity&quot; to the unclaimed page? (by the way, that is the suggestion; my badfic)</p>

            <p>Here&#39;s the link to an interesting webcomic based on the works of H.P. Lovecraft. Not only is the comic really good (in my opinion), but it&#39;s also great fun picking out all the references to Lovecraft&#39;s stories and characters. Updates are almost daily.<br><br><a href="http://owmysanity.comicgenesis.com/d/20091225.html">Ow My Sanity</a><br><br>And remember: <i>ph&#39;nglui mglw&#39;nafh Cthulhu R&#39;lyeh  wgah&#39;nagl fhtagn</i>.

            <p>Welcome to the Board. *sympathetic hug* I think most of the PPC&#39;s members have written badfic at one time or another. Don&#39;t feel too bad about it. I was writing badfic (none published, thankfully) up till I <i>found</i> the PPC, back in April 2008. Just enjoy your time here <s>and go slowly insane</s>. :P<br><br>Also, have a bag of pebbles and a Random Shiny Object. They should come in handy when fighting badfic.</p>

            <p>Don&#39;t worry, I did even worse before joining the PPC ranks. A good thing I never published any of my early fics, but I&#39;m going to kill my old self insertion characters anyways in a &quot;strange&quot; mission (actually a ounishment by the Flowers, since my agents kinda messed up in my last, still beta-status mission)<br><br>However, have a folding car.

            <p>So I find this webcomic called better days.  It contradicts itself on many levels, has an obvious author insert/gary  stu/god mode stu main character, and preaches its authors contradictory political views with increasing intensity as the comic progresses.   At first I think that nothing can be done about it because I thought it was original fiction, but as it turns out one of the main characters and one of the main plot points are each stolen from one of his friends&#39; comics.  To me this looks like a bad case of improbable AU, and is therefore vulnerable of being sporked.  It is also a furry comic, but I don&#39;t think that has anything to do with how bad it is.  If you feel the need to read it,  just search Better Days by Jay Naylor.  Jay Naylor sells furry porn for a living, so his site and the comic are NSFW, and ,for the comic portion, extremely NSFB.</p>

            <p>Naylor and Sherer (the artist of Badly Drawn Kitties) used to share characters and work on individual comics set within the same universe. They had a huge falling-out and &quot;split up&quot;, but continued to use the co-made characters. Thus, it&#39;s not fanfic, it&#39;s co-writing, therefore it&#39;s not under our jurisdiction.</p>

            <p>There&#39;s this MSTing site called Project A.F.T.E.R. Besides sporking truly horrendous anime-based fics, they also have a section that tackles bad webcomics. Normally, said comics are just plain weird, silly, cliché-ridden and so forth, but ultimately harmless. However, there is one, notable, exception. I&#39;m talking about &#39;Grim Tales From Down Below&#39;, a webcomic based on the Cartoon Network show &#39;The Grim Adventures of Billy &amp; Mandy&#39;, with appearances from Spawn, Jack Skellington, and others. Now, in this comic, the author, Bleedman (pseudonym of Vinson Ngo)...<br><br>*seethes*<br><br>*explodes with rage* MAKES FUN OF NINE ELEVEN!!! WHAT THE HELL KIND OF SICK BASTARD MAKES FUN OF NINE ELEVEN <i>AND</i> THE IRAQ WAR, HUH?!? THERE IS NO &quot;BILLY AND MANDY IN ALL OF US&quot;, YOU HEAR ME, NGO? IF I <i>EVER</i> GET MY HANDS ON YOU, I&#39;LL DRIVE A CROWBAR INTO YOUR HEAD, YOU CRAZY, TWISTED, LOLI FREAK!!!<br><br>*takes a deep breath*<br><br>I&#39;m sorry, I had to let that out. Oh, and don&#39;t think I&#39;m exaggerating. Ordinarily, I don&#39;t like bashing authors, but this guy knows perfectly well what he&#39;s doing. For proof, please click the link below. It&#39;ll lead you to the Project A.F.T.E.R. article.<br><br><a href="http://www.projectafter.com/cr_bmgrim.html">Part VII: &quot;Grim Tales From Down Below&quot;</a><br><br>What do you think? Am I right?</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve been trying to stay out of these, because I don&#39;t <i>like</i> drama. But that was uncalled for. <br><br>You said, and I quote:<br>IF I EVER GET MY HANDS ON YOU, I&#39;LL DRIVE A CROWBAR INTO YOUR HEAD, YOU CRAZY, TWISTED, LOLI FREAK!!!<br><br>Uncalled for. I do not care what they posted-- there was not even this much rage when the PPC found out about badfics using the Bible as a canon, a while back. And we had fundamentalist Christians on the &#39;Board. And they were calmer about their feelings than you were, there.<br><br>And I&#39;ve just seen your second response! And have asked July not to respond, because every time this starts, it gets a little worse, and I&#39;m trying to prevent another all-out war, so Neshomeh doesn&#39;t have to get involved. <br><br>Read the Constitution, please. No flaming, make posts legible. What July is objecting to is the ALLCAPS rant, basically telling the person you&#39;d attack them with a crowbar if you could, and calling them a &quot;crazy, twisted LOLI freak.&quot; Firstly, nobody here should be calling anyone a freak like that. We&#39;re a community of misfits who instruct newbies to leave their sanity at the door-- glass houses, anyone? Freak isn&#39;t a bad thing, and using &quot;crazy, twisted freak&quot; as an insult (over a comic!) is <i>absolutely</i> unnecessary. Even if they made fun of 9/11. People have done so, and will continue to do so. We deal with anger here by laughing at the stupid. We don&#39;t attack, we don&#39;t rage, we don&#39;t <i>threaten</i>.<br><br>We write silly stories to make the stupid feel less brain-numbing.<br><br>Also, to <s>censor</s> paraphrase: Intent is Not Magic. If you did not intend to make July angry, but you incidentally made quite a lot of people uncomfortable, your best bet is not to go &quot;Uh, but didn&#39;t he deserve it?&quot; Like I said, we write silly stories. We do other things, but we&#39;re not... a community of flamers and bashers and jerks. That is July&#39;s objection. I am responding because <s>her net connection ended and she couldn&#39;t see your post</s> I am sick of the wars between you and her, and even if I agree with her it&#39;s still quite tiresome.<br><br>Basically, if you want to get along with people here, stop going on the offensive. If you want to get along with July, just <i>apologize</i> when you&#39;re in the wrong, rather than trying to justify every time. I&#39;m not saying you should just roll over every time she (or anyone) criticises you, but sometimes you will be in the wrong! It is an inevitable fact of life, and going &quot;but what they did was worse!&quot; is not going to win you any friends. It should also be noted, by the way, that I am pointing this message at July as well. People do not need to be told every single time they were wrong, and being wrong is okay. Apologizing for being wrong is also okay! And everyone should be able to do that.<br><br>That means when you cross a line with a post, you look back at it and think &quot;What would someone think coming across this post from another perspective? Is the anger I am getting valid?&quot; and if the answer is yes, you apologize. And if you think you are being jumped on for no reason, you <i>calmly and rationally</i> explain why you disagree.<br><br>And we have a mature, adult conversation! That is how a forum keeps from spiralling into flame-wars.</p>

Now that the post is there, and can&#39;t be taken back. I wish now that I&#39;d simply not responded yesterday. So, once again, I sincerely apologize for what I did, and thank you for stepping in.</p>

            <p>And I&#39;m very glad to have been forgiven.<br><br>Also, something I just want to say. The calm, rational explanation as to why I objected to the comic in the first place (i.e. the way I should have said it), is this. In my mind, the 9/11 incident and the subsequent Iraq war are horrible, horrible things that have claimed countless lives and caused tremendous amounts of pain, grief and loss. Now, I know that sometimes putting bad events in a less serious or even humorous light, after some time has passed, can help people cope with them, and make them hurt a little less. To such things, I do <i>not</i> object, since they can serve a good purpose.<br><br>However, the way 9/11 is portrayed in the comic I mentioned, seems to me to be working towards the exact opposite goal. In certain panels of this comic (reproduced in the article I linked to) we see how Grim discovers two plans drawn out by Mandy. One shows a map of Iraq covered in skull symbols, with the words &#39;Operation Freedom&#39; printed over it. The other is a crude picture of the Twin Towers, with markings at the spots where the two airplanes will hit. The story behind this, apparently, is that Mandy herself planned the Twin Towers attack in order to kick off the &#39;War on Terror&#39;, which she also had planned.<br><br>This, I&#39;m practically certain, is something that can really, <i>really</i> hurt those who have lost loved ones in one (or, who knows, both) of those events. I found the whole thing to be in such bad taste that I ended up exploding.<br><br>So, there you have it. That&#39;s the reason I hate this comic so much.</p>

            <p>That <i>still</i> doesn&#39;t make exploding okay, which you seem to understand-- which is good. <br><br>But now we&#39;re on a cycle of, &quot;I&#39;m sorry, but this is why I did it.&quot; &quot;Okay, you&#39;re forgiven (on this end, at least), but it was still wrong.&quot; &quot;Okay, I&#39;m glad you forgive me but this is why I did it.&quot; &quot;...Yeah, still wrong.&quot;<br><br>I don&#39;t think it was even that offensive, frankly. People have done, said, and drawn far, far worse. I&#39;d be inclined to take it as at least partly a potshot aimed at conspiracy theorists and 9/11 Truthers. Again-- humor helps people cope. I nearly said in my earlier post that it wasn&#39;t fair for someone to attack the works of someone who may simply be trying to deal with the tragedy in their own way-- but didn&#39;t, because for all I know you&#39;re from NYC yourself. Seeing as you&#39;re &quot;practically certain&quot; that this might hurt someone who had lost loved oness in the tragedies, I&#39;ll deduce that you have not, in fact, and say it here.<br><br>I understand your point of view, but <i>it was still wrong</i>.<br><br>(My own qualms with the comic, having read the article and the author&#39;s explanation, is that &quot;it&#39;s what any other Reaper would do.&quot; Uh, no. This guy needs to read some Discworld.)</p>

            <p>...Hi...<br>It&#39;s been a little over a month since I first started posting on the Board, and I&#39;d like to request permission (as the subject line hints at).<br>Agents - Travis and Jen. Travis used to work for Team Rocket, and Jen was an Officer Jenny cadet. Both fell into HQ on the same day and wound up as partners, much to their annoyence. Jen is very strict about rules (she sometimes forgets she&#39;s not in a police force) and is easily angered. Travis is generally very hyper and is a huge kleptomaniac.Jen&#39;s very Lawful Good, while Travis is Chaotic Neutral/Evil. They work in the Department of Floaters, normally with video games.<br>I might come up with some more agents later on.<br>Writing sample: <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5782852/1/The_bSockpenguin_b_Adventures"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5782852/1/The_bSockpenguin_b_Adventures">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5782852/1/The_bSockpenguin_b_Adventures</a></a>.

            <p>Turns out my smut tolerance is a lot higher than I thought, hence my ability to read (nearly) all of it. Though it could also be the fact that the smut is so wildly over the top that it&#39;d be hilarious if it weren&#39;t so awful. I swear, in the course of her monstrously bland sex descriptions, Jenna Sue uses the word &#39;tiger&#39; more often than you and I put together have fingers and toes.</p>

            <p>I think you may be confused as to what you are actually looking for.  It seems to me that you are asking for your story to be used in a mission, which is a strange request.<br><br>Now, what you might actually <i>need</i> is a Beta-reader.  That is a service that we, as well as others on the internet, provide where someone reads your story and offers suggestions about how you might make the story better.  We would point out things like spelling, punctuation, and grammar as well as the aforementioned Mary Sue&#39;s and Marty Stu&#39;s.  Then you take the suggestions and use them as a tool to edit your story and increase the quality.<br><br>Anyways, if you are interested in finding a Beta, I am sure that someone around here would be willing to help.<br><br>Have a nice day,<br>-Phobos</p>

            <p>Yes, I was looking for a Beta-reader.  But I&#39;m also a bit of a glutton for punishment, and I want to see what WOULD happen if a mission took place in my story.  Are the missions for bad-fics only?</p>

            <p>Missions aren&#39;t only for badfic. They almost always are; but there&#39;s been at least two exceptions. First there was the Department of Intelligence mission to investigate a &quot;girl drops into Middle-earth&quot; fic which turned out not to actually be badfic; and then there was the mission wherein Stormsong and Skyfire&#39;s home fic was investigated (and the aforementioned agents rescued), which was overflow from Intel. Intel agents don&#39;t always get sent into badfic; they are sent into &quot;doubtful&quot; fics when the people in the sorting room can&#39;t figure out the fic&#39;s status for sure. Also, Allison and Tasmin have done some glitch-fixing missions into goodfic, to resolve minor errors and strengthen the continuum without destroying the fic.<br><br>But yes, what you are asking for is a beta reader. There&#39;s a beta reader directory on the wiki.</p>

            <p>I kind of got lost in Dwarf Fortress recently. I liked this mission. These two are pretty good together. I liked the bit about the Sue making Bella Swan look deep, and that line actually being a charge that Caleb wrote down. Also liked the bit about Kestrel throwing her knife at his throat at full force, because she knew it would bounce off.  I saw a couple of typos.  <br><br>I don&#39;t know the canon at all, but I&#39;d watch a movie starring Stephen Fry and Orlando Bloom.;)<br><br>triggered a few paragraphs worth of inner turmoil concerning her own love live with the as-of-yet unseen “John”.<br><br>and they can shove the thing in test tube.

            <p>Good fun. Interesting fic.<br><br>I do have to make one tiny little nitpick. (It&#39;s because I care. :P)<br>When you have a new thought, but the same speaker, it is acceptable to create a new paragraph instead of making a gigantic block of text or stuffing in speech tags willy-nilly. One denotes that it is the same speaker by leaving off the end quote of the paragraph before! Like so.<br><br>&quot;Lalalalalala kookaburra sits in the old gum tree, merry merry king of the bushes he.<br><br>&quot;And like so. Except with more text.&quot;<br><br>It&#39;s a perfectly acceptable grammatical practice, if my English knowledges haven&#39;t suddenly decided to lead me off a cliff.<br><br>Aside from that, though, Kestrel and Caleb are immensely hilarious to watch interact. Reeeeally interesting logic that &#39;fic had.<br><br>(Also FF-net has been eating linebreaks of late.)<br><br>I do like that Caleb is still definitely /vampire/, despite the sparkly etc. Seems like a fun partnership. :)</p>

            <p>...while most may not. Even when I posted here I wasn&#39;t exactly active. <br><br>Since I&#39;ve left this board I&#39;ve found my ability to switch off and enjoy fiction (both written and recorded) has gone completely. Willing Suspension of Disbelief is fine, but I have to question every stupid descision the characters make. Even with Spooks (a UK spy show for those who don&#39;t know) I&#39;m wondering why these professional spies don&#39;t do the obvious thing. For example when their base is locked down and bugged by hackers they stay in there rather than simply leaving and discussing it outside the building. <br><br>I blame you all for this. Your obsession with plot holes and Sues make me see them everywhere.  <br><br>Finally, in order to stop this simply being a bitching a thread, I&#39;m wondering if anyone else has had similar experiences. </p>

            <p>I write on a roleplay site, so the ability to detect power gamers/ metagamers/ GODMODDING JERKS is quite necessary... Unfortunately a lot of people don&#39;t care about proper character balance and just attempt to make characters as powerful as possible while thiefing names like there&#39;s no tomorrow, like the sod who called his character &quot;Raistlin Majere&quot; and somehow knew Force Healing AND Force Devastation while still claiming to be a Gray Jedi. Gray Jedi are NOT able to use both Light and Dark side powers, they merely have less conventional respect for authority. [/rant]<br><br>And of course, the people who make Gratuitous Canon Offspring when the character is a gentleman and would NEVER have done that. *Stares at one particular &quot;son of Qui-Gon Jinn&quot; that nearly sent me into fits of rage*<br><br>Aside from my roleplaying, Tv Tropes has made me sensitive in terms of works I am neutral towards or dislike... It does make me realize certain things about my favorite works, but even if my favorite characters are &quot;the scrappy&quot; or considered &quot;annoying&quot;, I don&#39;t really mind because they&#39;re my favorites. <br><br>It does sorta help that several of my best friends and I are TV Tropers, and have used Tropes to describe ourselves and our RP characters, I suppose.</p>

            <p>The last fic I read (a funny crossover between Card Captor Sakura and Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha) was full of &quot;errors&quot;, but still enjoyable since it was more of a comedy/parody, I shouldn&#39;t have cared about plotholes and non-canonical things in the first place. However, I still found myself doing a sort of &quot;charge list&quot;, despite it was not a sporkable fic.<br><br>But I don&#39;t find problems doing that, I still enjoy what I read.</p>

            <p>I don&#39;t watch much TV anymore, not fiction anyway. I watch some chatshows, cooking programs and the occasional sketch show. At least in the latter it is intentionally (I think) if the characters do something that isn&#39;t the most sensical thing.<br><br>I do try to read more fiction. Currently reading Chart Throb, a parody of shows like X Factor and Pop Idol. I&#39;m afraid I&#39;m not ready yet for fiction without humorous intent: spotting a plot hole can pull one out of the story, and that&#39;s not a nice feeling.</p>

            <p>...and I think I know what you&#39;re talking about, after all, it&#39;s quite common for people who frequent that site. I sort of do the same thing, except it manifests in the form of snarky comments directed at the characters of a certain TV show or something. <br><br>When you feel like that, try to remember what situation the characters are in - if you were in a base locked down and bugged, would you stay inside?

            <p>Ironically, I think it&#39;s unusually difficult for PPC characters to break the fourth wall.<br><br>In the PPC verse, all of fiction is real. Being a fictional character doesn&#39;t mean you can&#39;t be a sentient citizen of the multiverse. So acknowledging that the PPC verse itself might have one or more authors isn&#39;t breaking the fourth wall at all. Breaking the fourth wall is very difficult with metafiction in which authors exist in-universe.<br><br>I think you&#39;d actually have to write a mission in which the author of the story got involved.

            <p>I found a link to this from <a href="http://pottersues.livejournal.com/694523.html">Pottersues</a>. (Link goes to the article with it mentioned.)Apparently, some people  have developed a bot called RedBotton that scans certain fics for key words, typos or grammar issues - then they report the fics with it in. No reviewing, no concrit, no warning, presumably. <br>(<a href="http://news.deviantart.com/article/131404/">Here&#39;s</a> a DeviantArt article with some more information, and <a href="http://civilinitiative.blogspot.com/2010/08/redbotton-issue-and-what-it-means-for.html">here&#39;s</a> the place Pottersues linked.)<br><br>I just want to know what all of you PPCers think about this - a bot that is being used to report fics quickly without any constructiveness or help being offered. Frankly, I think it&#39;s wrong. Purging ff.net is not going to solve anything for anyone, but more to the point it isn&#39;t going to help anyone develop their writing.<br><br>Any thoughts?</p>

            <p>The fan-fiction.net owners haven&#39;t even tried to stop this yet.

I&#39;m now in an argument with LordKelvin (the creator of the damn program) and I think I&#39;ll be leaving until this is sorted. If this happens, and I don&#39;t come back, I love you all very, very much, and wish I didn&#39;t have to go. Thank you to everyone who&#39;s been with me on any of my stories, any comments made, any reviews posted, and any help given has been hugely appreciated. You&#39;ve been like family to me.<br><br>xxx Lemon<br><br>CLEVERBOT IS A LIE. IF YOU LIKE ME AT ALL LISTEN. You see, the program simply connects you to another user, who believes that YOU are the robot. After a while, the users are switched which is why the conversations are so random. If you attempt to tell someone else this, you are quickly switched after only a couple of more messages.<br><br>An extract from one of my conversations:<br><br>&quot;Cleverbot: No you&#39;re not.<br><br>User: Yes I am.<br><br>Cleverbot: No you are a machine.<br><br>User: Did you know cleverbot isn&#39;t actually a robot? It just puts you in contact to another user so you think it&#39;s a robot.<br><br>Cleverbot: Oh.<br><br>User: Now we&#39;re about to be split up because I told. I&#39;m not even joking, that&#39;s what they do. What&#39;s your first name?<br><br>This is where we were quickly split up.<br><br>Cleverbot: Am I clever?<br><br>User: YOU&#39;RE A LIE. YOU&#39;RE NOT A ROBOT, YOU&#39;RE A HUMAN BEING. WHAT&#39;S YOUR NAME?<br><br>Cleverbot: You just said that I&#39;m a robot.<br><br>User: No I didn&#39;t - that was someone else. The bot moves you on to another user after a while, that&#39;s why the conversations are so random, because it&#39;s not the same person.<br><br>Cleverbot: I thought of that theory, and I think I need more proof.<br><br>YOU SEE.<br><br>Me: Your mother is a prostitute.<br><br>CleverBot : Your father is a hamster.<br><br>Admittedly, that last part could be pure... well, it&#39;s probably not serious.

            <p>This is a horrible idea. Similar full-auto SPaG bots have been used to patrol Wikipedia in the past, but are now forbidden due to the huge false positive rate they had. It is virtually impossible to reduce this due to the myriad ways &#39;bad&#39; writing can be used on purpose. If WP has deemed such bots not-fit-for-purpose, it&#39;s probably for good reason. Even with heuristic learning (which I seriously doubt is in use here) it is very difficult to get such bots to work effectively.</p>

            <p>I agree with the others on this one. What if a character speaks in a dialect? What if a character who&#39;s had little education writes a letter, and it&#39;s full of spelling errors? What if a canon language that doesn&#39;t exist in World One is used in the fic? What if dirty language actually serves a purpose to the plot? What kind of creativity-stunting is this?<br><br>A computer program, a brainless piece of coding, deciding what&#39;s good and what&#39;s bad, reporting on it over and over, and thus potentially dooming the works of writers who are already good or on the way there.

            <p>a few weeks ago. For the most part that became a discussion on whether proper SPaG is mandatory (a guideline or rule) or merely a curtesy (etiquette) on ffnet. <a href="http://forum.fanfiction.net/topic/2872/32754222/1/"><br><br>The PPC isn&#39;t really about being constructive either. Most of us write missions because we really would have liked it if we could have done bodily harm to badfic. But most of us also give concrit to the authors we &quot;target&quot; or at least to authors that look like they can still make something of their story. We don&#39;t do that under the guise of the PPC, we do that with our (other) only personas.<br><br>Red button, bad thing. There&#39;s a risk of false positives. Sometimes there&#39;s some bad grammar in the story for purposes of plot point. The problem that bothers me most is the risk of false positives and that there doesn&#39;t seem to be any manual check whether or not a story deserves to be flagged.</a></p>

            <p>If it doesn&#39;t do concrit, it&#39;s a bad idea. Moreover, bots like that tend to make mistakes and generalizations (as already seen in censorship screening) so goodfic could be being reported as well.<br><br>Now, if the author him/herself used it to check his/her own stories for obvious problems?
