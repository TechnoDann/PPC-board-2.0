            <p>No offense meant, but this sounds like a Redwall-specific Fanfiction.net run by writers and rather worse, seeing as we&#39;re not allowed to touch or criticize anything but goodness knows that some of the challenges will likely be dreadful, seeing as all kinks are protected. It opens up a new batch of stories, though, so thanks for the link.</p>

            <p>Trojie did put something in her Slash-Sporking Guide saying stuff from requests or fic memes was a bad idea to spork:<br><br><i>&quot;Basically, if someone has been challenged to or asked to produce something specific, I consider it out of bounds. If it&#39;s locked, and therefore technically out of the public eye, then I consider it out of bounds. I would also advise caution when sporking anonymously-posted fics - you never know who they could have been produced by, and if you are active in the fandom you&#39;re sporking, you may find out you&#39;ve just horrifically offended one of your friends or readers by sporking something they wrote.&quot;</i><br><br>Also, given that practically every fandom has one of these and theirs <i>aren&#39;t</i> invariably overrun with trash which Must Be Sporked, I don&#39;t see why it&#39;s a bad idea to have one in this fandom.</p>

            <p>Trojie&#39;s opinion is her own, but I certainly think it&#39;s a <i>good</i> policy to adopt for the PPC in general. Parody and &#39;crackfics&#39; also tend to be treated lightly, given that they&#39;re not intended to be serious, or are, indeed, requested. Does anyone think we should make it general (ie, official) policy, or just let it be and keep it as a Good But Not Essential-To-Follow Piece Of Advice?</p>

            <p>Something that&#39;s written for a specific request is made for the requester, not really fandom in general, so I think it <i>is</i> rude to then go and spork it.

            <p>So, I&#39;ve been wondering, if you have an agent, and they&#39;re not from world one, do they get to keep their powers from their home continuum? <br><br>An example would be,if they&#39;re from the Narutoverse, and a ninja to boot, would they be able to pull off jutsu in the HQ? or another continuum like LoTR?<br><br>Neither of my planned agents are from any continum with super powers or anything, but I was curious as too what follows them over from their home continuum. </p>

            <p>As other people have noted, it&#39;s very much a case-by-case thing.<br><br>There are &#39;verses that share the same magical system -for instance, Dragonlance and Forgotten Realms are both D&amp;D settings, and use the same magical systems. A mage from one could reasonably be expected to have no trouble in the other. I&#39;d be willing to accept crossovers between &#39;verses that have similar systems, especially when they&#39;re ill-defined: A D&amp;D sorcerer would probably not have too many difficulties working magic in Valdemar, for instance.<br><br>On the other hand, there are &#39;verses that are very definitely not compatible. For instance, a Potterverse wizard isn&#39;t going to be able to do anything in Earthsea, where everything works by knowing things&#39; True Names. That said, I wouldn&#39;t have a problem believing that someone inclined to magic in one &#39;verse is also inclined to magic in other ones, even if the underlying mechanism changes.</p>

            <p>Though I&#39;ve had my own take on things. I have a few Agents from &#39;verses other than World One, and those of them that <i>have</i> any real powers (one LOTR-verse Elf with his natural physical abilities, one Potterverse wizard, and one as-yet-tentatively potential Jedi Padawan) can still access their abilities on missions <i>if not disguised</i>.<br><br>As I see it, when the Disguise Generators put somebody into a disguise, that person is then limited to the abilities of the being they&#39;re disguised as. If they drop the disguise, they can access their own abilities again, unless the continuum has specifically disallowed said abilities.<br><br>In HQ, of course, Disguise Generators aren&#39;t necessary and powers are unblocked there.</p>

            <p>First question: Nanohaverse (Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha) magic is based on the so-called &quot;Linker Core&quot;, a sort of immaterial organ that allows the mage to process magic (and it&#39;s also the &quot;fuel tank&quot; for mana). Since it&#39;s something inherent the character and not the continuum, it should work out of the Nanohaverse, right? (I&#39;ve got an Agent from that continuum and I was thinking about getting another one)<br><br>Second question: The Agent I was going to recruit is Material-S from the MGLN Battle Of Aces PSP game. She&#39;s a magical construct &quot;clone&quot; of the main character, Nanoha, and looks like she can be a good Agent: she&#39;s quite calm and polite, so she shouldn&#39;t go insane and can restrain more hot-blooded Agents, and has the psicological need for blowing enemies up, so she can happily kill Sues and disintegrate Author Wraiths. She has quite too much firepower (Nanoha, the girl she is a clone of, is called &quot;White Devil&quot;, &quot;Gundam in schoolgirl dress&quot;, &quot;Sailor Beamspam&quot; and &quot;Demonic Cannon Girl&quot;. Yeah.), but nothing I cannot nerf down (power limiters exist in the home continuum itself).<br>Provided she is canonically dead (and, besides, she&#39;s in a side continuum made for the game, she doesn&#39;t exist in the main MGLN canon), may I recruit her?</p>

            <p>It depends on the powers, I think. Also, in messed up fics pretty much everything goes and canon&#39;s on your side.<br><br>For the HQ: This thing&#39;s basically a mashup of everyting, it keeps changing more often than Hogwarts stairways and operates on the base of the Laws of Narrative Comedy.<br><br>My take on it: One of my characters is a Warcraft!Paladin.

            <p>He can shapeshift without a DORKS to a limited extent (swap between humanoid and non-anthro fox), but he has to specifically program the ability into the DORKS to use it within continua where characters aren&#39;t supposed to be able to shapeshift.

            <p>is the general power level of the continuum the agents will be working in. A lot of worlds are just not survivable by a standard human, so an agent would require above human attributes to work in those worlds. Drop the same agent into a World One based continuum and the agent would be either ridiculously over-powered or constantly restricted.</p>

            <p>There&#39;s a lot of agents in the PPC from various continua, and so far from what I&#39;ve seen around the general consensus is that they have access to any race or continua specific powers they used to have, seeing as it&#39;s usually a matter of biology. For instance, Agent Gremlin in the department of Bad Slash is a meta-human from the DCU who has the power to manipulate electricity and machines. Because her power is based on a meta-gene complex, and is this a part of her biology in much the same way your arm is, she can use this power in any continuum she wishes.<br><br>However, there is an addendum when it comes to magic and magic-like powers, which is that only magic from that continuum is usable since it follows that continuum&#39;s rules. For instance, a wizard agent from Harry Potter could use his magic in a mission in the Harry Potter continuum, but if he went to the Dresden Files continuum, where they have different rules for magic, he couldn&#39;t use his H.P. magic without breaking the rules of canon, which is a Bad Thing. Since chakra and jutsu are basically another type of magic, they fall under this same rule. However, within HQ magic should work just fine.</p>

            <p>Definitely shape-shifting. With the caveat, of course, that you keep your mind and soul in every shape you take. I don&#39;t mind it taking practice-- as in, turning your physical shape into a dog&#39;s does not mean you are good at being a quadruped, and flight would be a trick unto itself-- and a new trick with every different kind of bird. (Example: crows flap like crazy to gain altitude at all, raptors soar, sparrows flutter, and hummingbirds are basically the teeny-tiny helicopters of the avian world.) Likewise with sharks, and remembering to keep your tail in motion at all times.<br><br>Still! Imagine shifting into a Thunderbird-- you could make it all the way across the continent in record time! Or, if you could do something extra-dimensional, like a Sasquatch or one of the Fae, and use the Ways? Plus, disguises! Invisibility! And all the experiments it would take aside, eventually being able to fly in human form!</p>

            <p>It&#39;s been a slightly disruptive time, with an uncertain schedule and things changing--in a good way, fortunately; but such things are not conducive to writing. Also, I think I&#39;m being held hostage by my unfinished NaNovel from last year. I don&#39;t know if I can work seriously on anything else until I finish it and fix it and make it respectable. But it&#39;s haaaaard....<br><br>On the upside, I HAVE worked on compiling a list of Germanic names and a glossary of their elements and meanings, which I enjoyed immensely and will most likely continue to build on as I discover new elements. Also, I&#39;ll probably end up doing a similar thing for other language groups if my characters ever spend much time in a location with a different language--I figure differentiating names between peoples is the easiest way I can indicate a different language without actually knowing or inventing them. So, you know, if you ever need an Old English/Norse/German-sounding name and want to know what it means, let me know. You&#39;d have to figure out which permutations of the elements belong to which branch if it matters to you, though, &#39;cause I didn&#39;t keep track. ^_^;<br><br>~Neshomeh, amateur anthroponomatologist.</p>

            <p>It&#39;s that most wonderful time of the year, my friends and casual acquaintances! I&#39;ve hung up the colorful lights and the stockings on my wall, I&#39;ve spooled up my Mannheim Steamroller and my Robert Shaw and my assorted other festive albums, and I&#39;ve FINALLY updated the <a href="http://starshadowhall.tripod.com/ppc/songbook/">PPC Holiday Songbook</a>. That means it&#39;s time for a round of holiday filking!<br><br>If you have no idea what I&#39;m talking about, the idea is this: pick your favorite Christmas/Hanukah/[insert preferred holiday here]/winter song, and write new words to it, with a PPC-flavored twist. There are plenty of examples in the Songbook, of course--but don&#39;t worry about using the same tune again. Pick whatever you like, and do however many you feel like doing.<br><br>I do have an additional challenge, however. In keeping with our effort this year to celebrate the non-Sue-related aspects of the organization, I&#39;d like to see this year&#39;s filks cover a wide range of topics, departments, and general themes. Of course, if you have a really, really great idea for a Sue-slaying song, go for it--but maybe after that you can write one about the Department of Finance, too. {= )<br><br>ALSO, I would be exceptionally thrilled if anyone felt like recording some of the filks, either old or new. Keily recently did a couple, which I&#39;ve now linked from the Songbook (<a href="http://starshadowhall.tripod.com/ppc/songbook/ppciscoming.html">PPC Is Coming to Town</a> and <a href="http://starshadowhall.tripod.com/ppc/songbook/consoleyells.html">Console Yells</a>, if you want to check them out). I&#39;ll try to do one or two myself, but no promises--I rarely like how I sound in a recording. But anyway, the more, the merrier! Go nuts!<br><br>To start off the filking, here&#39;s my (first?) entry:<br><br><b>Carol of the Recruit</b><br>To the tune of &quot;Carol of the Drum/Little Drummer Boy&quot;<br><br>Come, they told me, pa rum pum pum pum<br>Come join the PPC, pa rum pum pum pum<br>A thousand worlds to see, pa rum pum pum pum<br>Don&#39;t need a Ph.D., pa rum pum pum pum,<br>rum pum pum pum, rum pum pum pum,<br><br>Only insanity, pa rum pum pum pum,<br>When you come.<br><br>All you agents, pa rum pum pum pum<br>I&#39;m just a book nerd, too, pa rum pum pum pum<br>I have no Ph.D., pa rum pum pum pum<br>Only this Lit degree, pa rum pum pum pum,<br>rum pum pum pum, rum pum pum pum,<br><br>Shall I spellcheck, pa rum pum pum pum,<br>When I come?<br><br>Flowers nodded, pa rum pum pum pum<br>Agents passed Bleeprin &#39;round, pa rum pum pum pum<br>I have a partner now, pa rum pum pum pum<br>I spork bad &#39;fic, and how! pa rum pum pum pum,<br>rum pum pum pum, rum pum pum pum,<br><br>I gave my sanity, pa rum pum pum pum,<br>For Fandom.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>To m&#39;new agents, Lyn and Mohan.<br><br>Mohan is a L&#39;Ang, which is a species from a canon that hasn&#39;t exactly been published just yet. *cough* Think of him as... let&#39;s say, a hross from a Narrative where the hrossa are Fallen, and have access to magic. Aside from what-all description&#39;s entered in the story below, he carries a quarterstaff of adamant, which can be charged with a shock-type spell, but is generally just used to hit people really hard. When out of uniform, he wears a kilt and naught else, to his partner&#39;s dismay.<br><br>Lyn is a human from Earth, our own home Narrative, of indiscriminate late-teen-early-twenties age. She is definitely female, despite the unwillingness of various people to admit this. She wears contacts or glasses, depending on circumstances, and is proficient with a broadsword or firearm. She lacks superpowers, but has an unnerving ability to blend into the background of any context, and remain forgotten until information is inadvertently revealed. Out of uniform, she wears paint-spattered t-shirts and jeans, and the occasional hoodie.<br><br>---<br><br><i>Firstly: These chips aren&#39;t just salty, they&#39;re LIMEY and salty. Most excellent.<br><br>Secondly: The trees in this plaza, I have noticed, are very tastefully lit. Far better than the old West Haven green, or Milford, for that matter.<br><br>Thirdly: I&#39;m wondering, now, where you are. It&#39;s been about half an hour since we were supposed to meet, the stores are beginning to clear out, and still no sign of my inter-dimensional friend. I would worry, if it wasn&#39;t so counter-productive.</i><br><br>&quot;Counter-productive or not, this is beginning to be worrisome,&quot; Lyn said aloud, putting down the notebook to glance around. Mohan was still nowhere in sight, and this was a rather important meeting. She wondered if he&#39;d had trouble finding a portal. As she began to contemplate the relative risks and potential benefits of trying to contact him, there was a faintly musical swishing noise, like the wind on a ghostly set of chimes. The darkness parted, and a frosty grey glow spread in the empty space between the curb and the well-lit tree before it. After a moment, there was a louder noise, the sound of the membranes of reality being parted-- and he stepped through, into the First World.<br><br>&quot;Hmmmm,&quot; he said, glancing around. Lyn stood, crumpling the empty chip bag into her knapsack, and grinned up at him. He was lit up in silhouette, by the glow of the portal, and she studied him for the moment before it went out. He was significantly taller than her-- given, that wasn&#39;t hard to do to a girl who was 5&#39;6&quot;, but at 8&#39;10&quot;, Mohan stood significantly taller than most human beings. You might mistake him for one at the first glance, if there was a fair distance and poor lighting, but the second glance wouldn&#39;t be able to hide it-- he was most definitely not human-- barely humanoid, in fact. He was covered in downy, light brown fur, and if the three-segmented arms didn&#39;t give away the rest, the long, catlike tail behind him definitely would. Lyn had known him for years now, and was entirely used to the unorthodox appearance he presented.<br><br>&quot;I&#39;m not late, am I? Mislaid this bedratted uniform, it took me half the morning to find it.&quot;<br><br>She shrugged. &quot;A bit, but it&#39;s no big deal. We&#39;ve just go--&quot; she stopped short, glaring down at the portal. There&#39;d been no noise this time, but a small shape (relatively speaking, of course) had appeared behind him. &quot;...Mohan, is that Tig?&quot;<br><br>He looked back, frowned down at the shape, and swore loudly. &quot;I locked him out! Tig, you little monster!&quot;<br><br>Lyn rubbed her forehead tiredly, then shrugged. &quot;Not much we can do now, Mohan. We&#39;re going to be late if we wait any longer. Let&#39;s just bring him, and hope he can stay out of trouble.&quot;<br><br>Nodding assent, the ex-pirate, soon-to-be-assassin stooped and picked up the cat, who weighed a good ten pounds and was built like a bobcat; it looked like a kitten in his arms. &quot;Got the... device?&quot;<br><br>She reached into the knapsack and held up the Portal Generator. &quot;Yup. Ready when you are, dude.&quot; He grinned reassuringly as she punched in the coordinates, double-checking against the little piece of paper that had come with it, and inhaled sharply when the portal popped into existence, casting a much sharper purpley light over their surroundings. Lyn gave him a shaky sort of smile. &quot;Here goes nothing,&quot; she whispered, and stepped through the door to PPC HQ. Mohan followed, Tig&#39;s distinctive mew heralding the way.<br><br><i>Ah, you&#39;ve arrived. Took you long enough.</i> The SO leaned over his desk, watching them both over his steepled fronds.<br><br>&quot;Sorry about the delay, Sir,&quot; Lyn said, stepping forward with a salute. &quot;Lynx Salfadge, reporting for duty.&quot;<br><br>Mohan echoed the gesture, with a rather more archaic salute, bringing his right arm across his chest smartly. &quot;Mohan 화이트 스타 마운틴의, reporting for duty.&quot;<br><br>The SO quirked a petal,  a gesture reminiscent of a single raised eyebrow. <i>Interesting. Welcome, both of you. I have your papers here,</i> he intoned, pushing the two manila folders across the desk. <i>You&#39;ll be spending your time in Foraging, at first. I highly suggest you read the manual before attempting any actions in the course of your duty. There will be no senior partners to teach either of you, as our Cafeteria workers have been using Replicators for the past few generations.</i><br><br>Lyn nodded, took the folder, and then stopped short. Mohan raised an eyebrow, not budging.<br><br>&quot;Foraging? I was told this was an assassin&#39;s position.&quot;<br><br>The SO quirked a petal again, and spread its fronds in a sort of shrug. <i>Something has been going wrong with the Replicators, and those Agents who do actually depend on the Cafeteria are beginning to suffer. We don&#39;t need assassins as much as we need food-- or the staff who can&#39;t get it elswhere do, anyway.</i><br><br>Lyn frowned, but turned back around, reaching for Mohan&#39;s folder. He took it from her, not looking away from the SO. &quot;This is not, I trust, a permanent situation?&quot;<br><br>The SO gave another shrug. <i>I doubt it. The sooner we can get the correct Department on it, the sooner we can fix it. Dismissed, Agents.</i><br><br>As they left, Mohan glanced down at his folder, which Tig had been batting at in vain. &quot;Response Center?&quot; he wondered aloud. &quot;I thought those only got assigned to Field Agents.&quot;<br><br>Lyn shrugged, still lost in thought. &quot;We&#39;ll be working in the field, too. Stealing food out of plot-holes and the like. What Resp...&quot; she trailed off, looking down at the folder. &quot;Response Center 10739. <i>Wow.</i>&quot;<br><br>Mohan quirked an eyebrow. &quot;That a problem?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Eh, just annoying. That was my student ID. Of course it&#39;s following me into the PPC.&quot; She shook her head. &quot;Ah, there we go-- on the left.&quot;<br><br>He followed her glance to a hallway he could&#39;ve sworn wasn&#39;t there a moment ago, and the doorway it led to, which was eight feet and six inches, exactly. Well, this was going to be all kinds of fun!</p>

            <p>It sounds great, they&#39;ll be in supporting roles, but still in danger (sort of). Collecting food from plot holes sounds like it could be serious, are they also going to be getting food from made up locations that don&#39;t exist in the canon?</p>

            <p>Has anyone ever run across one of these? A fic that manages to be &#39;okay&#39; despite having a rather large Suvian problem? Because I think I found one for One Piece:<br><br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5791985/1/"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5791985/1/">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5791985/1/</a></a><br><br>On the one hand, the villains are overpowered in a way that&#39;d make Sosuke Aizen run away like a little girl. The second-strongest of the villain group, for instance, defeats the Blackbeard Pirates solo, and the leader kills several characters essential to the canon storyline, including but not limited to Admirals Kizaru and Akainu, Gekko Moriah, Bartholomew Kuma, and Blackbeard.<br><br>On the other hand, there&#39;s none of that smug &quot;I&#39;m writing it better&quot; tone you find in the really bad ones. The author genuinely seems to enjoy Oda&#39;s style and writing in his world, and does his best, with things like names and narration tone, to match the canon.<br><br>Anyone else seen anything like this?</p>

            <p>What&#39;s really sad is that there are so many ways to work that kind of theme into a work that actually don&#39;t suck. Like, a story about somebody coming to grips with it, and managing to make new friends anyway. Or a story about a person so caught up with it that when they exit out from inside the wall and people <i>don&#39;t care</i> because so many other problems are going on, that they learn to deal with it.<br><br>But of course that&#39;s not going to be the case. Competent writing can make anything kind of interesting. But young writing will usually throw the possibility of quality in the crapper.<br><br>Kids don&#39;t even realize their own ulterior motives for this stuff, unfortunately... It&#39;s only after the fact that I realize the dumb things I wrote as a kid were me trying to express what people kept telling me to shut up about.<br><br>And they told me rightly. Nobody wants to hear about Mary Sue concepts in real life. So like a fart held in for too long, it escapes silently into fandom where nobody knows who let it out... but BOY are Worgen going to make a big stink...</p>

            <p>I&#39;m not sure. I don&#39;t see why not - I know that Captain Jack Sparrow is largely the way he is because of how Depp chose to play him, rather than how he was written or directed, so in that case, certainly. In more general situations... maybe. There&#39;s certainly no reason you couldn&#39;t add the actor&#39;s name into the exorcism, but to the exclusion of the writers? I wouldn&#39;t. The more names the better. </p>

            <p>I don&#39;t quite understand what you mean by that first question. Maybe you could make it a bit clearer? A character acts the way they do because of the author, generally.<br><br>Questions 2 and 3, though... the links from Pretzel&#39;s replay do cover it well in one sense; Lycaenion did cover it well in those missions. However, Rule of Funny/Cool can always intervene, not to mention the potential for Disguise Generator malfunction.<br><br>Re: 2 - in my view, it <i>is</i> possible for the daemon to stop being a separate entity whilst the disguise is on, but it&#39;s also possible for them to remain separate. It shouldn&#39;t matter too much; they&#39;d still be covered by the SEP-field. If it&#39;s funnier one way than the other, do it the funny way unless you have a good reason not to.<br><br>Re: 3 - I don&#39;t think the Disguise Generator can <i>create</i> a daemon. However, there&#39;s always potential for substitutes; a particularly intelligent pet, or other small but smart creature, can have the Disguise Generator used on them to create the desired effect.<br><br>There&#39;s also a possibility I considered introducing for one of my Agents, but later dropped due to the new limits he&#39;d have placed on him, though it would be a canonical thing to have happen. Namely, entering Lyra&#39;s world in HDM was shown to be able to <i>cause</i> one&#39;s daemon to appear as a separate entity. I cite John Parry, who met his osprey daemon Sayan Kotor after stepping from his world into Lyra&#39;s. It&#39;s not a guarantee, though - when Will goes into that world, he doesn&#39;t find his daemon, after all.<br><br>Just thought I&#39;d throw that possibility out there in case you liked the idea.</p>

            <p>Ia&#39;m beginning to think I&#39;m not really cut out to be here. I&#39;m obviously not as talented as I&#39;d like to be; my &quot;escaped canon&quot; storyline was panned, at least one member of the old guard is uncomfortable with me, I&#39;ve been unoriginal (or perhaps even plagiaristic!) in my usage of lines both here and elsewhere (ie, sometimes I&#39;d use a line that I first heard in a movie or comic absent-mindedly or &quot;just because it&#39;s cool,&quot; then forget about it and only later realize that I should go back and credit it), there have been concerned with whether or not the PPC would let in a Nurglish Daemon at all, the list goes on. <br><br>I think I jumped into this too early. I&#39;m against badfic in all its forms, but I&#39;m not an experienced fic writer or sporker. I need time to polish.<br><br>I&#39;m loath to let a good storyline just drop, I&#39;ll write so my next mission, which will wrap up the starjeffry and &quot;escaped canon&quot; storylines, and then embark on an extended leave of absence. Will I be back? Who knows. Maybe once I&#39;m a better writer. Anyone&#39;s free to use my characters, provided you don&#39;t kill them.<br><br>So, as Elizabeth Corday once said: &quot;It&#39;s been lovely.&quot;</p>

            <p>I&#39;m a bit late, I guess, but oh well. Just wanna say that I&#39;m with the folks who think you&#39;re overreacting, since I don&#39;t recall anyone picking on you recently, so I have no idea where this came from. Anyway, considering that I gave you Permission in the first place and have worked with you since, I obviously thought it was worth the time. Agent Chliever has a slightly sick brand of humor that may not appeal to everyone, but I enjoy(ed) him, and I note that other people feel the same way. As for Rilwen&#39;s point, I would&#39;ve thought that was covered by whatever it was cutting him off from the Warp, and therefore a nonissue.<br><br>The only thing I ever had a problem with was the Eponine thing, mainly because it made certain departments look bad, not necessarily because it couldn&#39;t be done. It could easily have been fixed.<br><br>As for &quot;stealing&quot; ideas... the truth is, everyone does it. Nothing is completely original--it&#39;s all based on our experiences, so familiar things can&#39;t help but slip in. You&#39;re familiar with TV Tropes--you know how concepts get used and reused, subverted, inverted, etc. The trick is just to combine these things in new ways with enough of our own personalities to make them appear new. It&#39;s all about slight of hand. Originality is all a matter of style, which I happen to think you have. It&#39;s a little dark and a little twisted, but not moreso than it is goofy and fun, and I thought it worked.<br><br>So, that&#39;s my $0.02. Maybe as much as $0.05. Anyway, since you&#39;ve already made up your mind, you can just take it as a vote of confidence for whatever you do next. And I&#39;m still available to beta, should you wish it and have the patience to put up with me. {= )<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Still renders the hand useless, but it&#39;s not quite as lethal to the rest of the body, or in the case, the Warp. Of course, the hand can still be made to function under its own power should the right mumbo-jumbo be applied.<br><br>Not saying a Deamon as an agent was a good idea, especially not a Great Unclean One, but if anyone could find a way to cut a Deamon off from the Warp and leave it functional it would be the PPC. Probably DoSAT and Medical working together. Not sure why they&#39;d bother, since the thing would be a damn nuisance even by itself, but it could probably be done.</p>

            <p>This is going to be incredibly jerkish and callous for me to say, but Cheliver... It feels to me that you have some kind of self esteem problem here. If nobody is actively hating on your work, then nobody probably hates it. It feels like this is your own self-esteem making you think that you aren&#39;t good enough to be around us.<br><br>I&#39;m new here myself. But if there&#39;s any impression, there is NOBODY around who isn&#39;t worthy to at least hang out here. Even writers of Mary Sues, if they have an open mind and aren&#39;t afraid to swallow their pride and improve.<br><br>You have two options here, in my mind. You can wail in despair, feel worthless, knock over your block tower and go home. Or you can look at your block tower, see the structural problems in it, and then perform renovations... which I am sure <i>anybody</i> here would be happy to support you in doing if you feel it has to be done.<br><br>You won&#39;t get anything done by deleting everything and then waiting for the day you feel as if you&#39;re &#39;good enough&#39; to be here. As if we&#39;re some kind of holier-than-thou snobbery society. You were approved, so base quality must be at least reasonable.<br><br>Dude. We can help if you want help. We&#39;re here to be chums. Leaving because you feel bad about yourself isn&#39;t going to solve your problems if your perception is &#39;I&#39;m not talented enough.&#39; You won&#39;t suddenly become more talented. But if you stay and improve, you might eventually see yourself as better than you do now.<br><br>(OK, GIANT JERK MOMENT over.)</p>

            <p>I think Aster sums things up pretty well here. If you still enjoy writing PPC-based works, then maybe you just need to take a few steps back and think about how you can switch some things around. You can get a fresh start with some new Agents, maybe– clean up your problems <i>and</i> stick around. <br><br>Of course, if you&#39;re genuinely tired of the whole deal, far be it from me to pull you back in and handcuff you to the metaphorical wall. But you learn from your mistakes, in fandom and writing, and you get a lot better afterwards. <br><br>Think of it this way– even if you do decide to leave for good, the things you&#39;ve learned here will (hopefully) help you out with your future writing projects. :)</p>

            <p>And it&#39;s what bothered me so much.<br>Chliever dies, Nurgle learns everything, HQ is invaded and taken over, the canon worlds are invaded next, and the entire multiverse writhes in the grip of disease and Chaos.<br><br>Congrats. Not all of us can make Agents capable of bringing about multiversal apocalypse. :p<br><br>I think you should rework everything. Maybe make Chliever and his brothers just cultists of Nurgle whose disease-spreading has been curtailed, but not before it made them crazy enough to intermittently believe they are Great Unclean Ones.<br>A cultist is a bit dodgy, but can be monitored to make sure they don&#39;t spread their cult. And does not automatically give all knowledge to a Chaos God if killed.</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve talked to other people in the past who&#39;ve been uncomfortable with the idea of that particular Agent. I don&#39;t know 40K very well, but the things I&#39;ve found about it along with the stuff that&#39;s been presented in this thread say to me that it&#39;s not a good idea to have an Agent like that in the PPC, and that&#39;s leaving out the fact that, as Chliever&#39;s said (and I agree), the Flowers wouldn&#39;t want to take that risk.<br><br>I think you&#39;re getting a little too quick to jump on Rilwen for the tone she&#39;s making her points in; she&#39;s not trying to be malicious, and I don&#39;t see her &quot;ridiculing&quot; anyone, just stating her opinion. She&#39;s blunt and honest about it, but if she was trying to be outright <i>nasty</i> you would know.<br><br>Besides, Chliever&#39;s not getting upset about it. If he was, then maybe you&#39;d be justified in telling Rilwen to knock it off, but she&#39;s said her piece and Chliever&#39;s accepted her point reasonably, so leave it at that, hm?</p>

I don&#39;t encourage pretending not to be bothered, so that&#39;s why I had to say something.<br><br>The truth is, I am defending my own judgement as well as Hamburger-formerly-known-as-Chliever, since I&#39;m the one who gave Permission for Agent Chliever and did actually find him funny. At the time I was satisfied that he was sufficiently nerfed for use as an agent, and while I won&#39;t pretend my memory is perfect, I feel like a strong outcry against the idea at that time would not have gone unanswered. Concerns were raised, yes, but I thought they were addressed adequately. I don&#39;t remember hearing strong complaints after that until the &quot;missing canon&quot; fiasco, which I didn&#39;t like, either, and at that point I started working with him personally to avoid any future blowups like that. So, if you really feel like this shouldn&#39;t have happened in the first place, or should have stopped a long time ago, you all ought to be criticizing me about the mistake I made in allowing it, not venting at the guy when he&#39;s already decided to abandon the idea. I could make a mistake again--his is done and he&#39;s learned from it.<br><br>To take a lighter and more generally-addressed tone, I don&#39;t know if people are aware that I am approachable for concerns, complaints, etc. Not necessarily as a PG, but as somebody who&#39;s been around a long time and would prefer to hear concerns and deal with them off the Board before they fester and become drama here. Concerns you don&#39;t talk about solve nothing. Please speak up to someone, if not me, if there&#39;s something going on here you don&#39;t like. My contact information is available on the Wiki.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>And no, before anybody jumps on me for this, I&#39;m not the one driving him out. I&#39;ve seethed privately about this and not said a word to him about the absurdity. And now that the topic&#39;s come up, I&#39;m saying it.<br><br>Evil-based!Agents? Fine. But they should have the capacity for being individual beings who can make their own decisions. If someone wanted to play a Good Omens demon, I&#39;d be fine with it as long as they did it well. But some things just don&#39;t play nicely with a multiversal organisation, and a creature that&#39;s technically a partial presence of a 40K Chaos God is one of those things.</p>

            <p>There are lots of ways that an agent could have that connection permanently severed--there are, for example, a lot of sci-fi universes where &quot;brain uploading&quot; is possible; just upload Chliever&#39;s personality into a convenient android brain and put the body on ice somewhere--cryogenic storage, which isn&#39;t technically death. (Actually, if it were me, I would use a Sims 2 Servo. It has all the same abilities as a regular Sim, minus most of the exaggerated needs to eat and use the toilet, and is quite tough. They can be built in-universe with a robot-making station, and when they are initialized, they take on the personality, skills, and abilities of the person who initialized them. This is pretty much perfect for a &quot;mind transfer&quot;.)<br><br>Sure, the chaos god thing could be a problem; but--you have the technology of the multiverse available. Finding a work-around is not impossible at all.</p>

            <p>If you really feel like you&#39;re not cut out for the PPC right now, I honestly won&#39;t stop you, but I feel like it&#39;s a bit of a waste. Honestly, from reading your missions I don&#39;t really agree with you on that front, but it&#39;s your own personal assessment that counts, I guess.<br><br>However, I will say this; Writers are thieves, each and every single one of them. Writers see an idea they like, latch onto it, twist it and turn it around a bit to fit what they like, and run away with their stolen ideas as fast as they can make themselves go. Sure, outright plagiarism is most definitely a bad thing, but it doesn&#39;t take much to fix that if you catch it, and those little twists to things usually used to fix said plagerism make big differences. For instance, that decommissioning scene of yours from your introduction? You took an idea, changed it a bit, and made it yours, and it was all well and good. <br><br>Basically, what I&#39;m trying to say is that A) you&#39;re improving, which is only a good thing, B) you aren&#39;t really doing anything the rest of us already aren&#39;t, and C) if you&#39;re willing to fix what little damage you did in the past, then all will be forgiven. So really, I at least feel that you don&#39;t really need to go unless you truly feel that you aren&#39;t cut out for this place, and if you say you do then I&#39;ll disagree. Anyways, I&#39;m looking forward to your next mission!</p>

            <p>See, what happened was, out of absolutely nowhere, Skipper randomly announces to Martin that his &quot;cousin Mudge&quot; knows a unicorn. Martin did not react in the least to hearing this. Skipper also picked a ... very inappropriate time to say so, if you catch my drift. It took me a few moments to be certain I hadn&#39;t read it wrong.</p>
