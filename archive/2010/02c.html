            <p>Chances are, none of you remember me. I was in the PPC from about 2005-2007ish, and for the past 2-3 years I&#39;ve been trapped *cough* Happily Partying *cough* in Real Person Slash. <br><br>I was feeling a little nostalgic, though, and decided to &quot;return to my roots&quot;, so to speak, and see how everything in the PPC is going. <br><br>I&#39;ll probably lurk a bit, but if you wish to seek me out, I will be in the Bad Slash Department, or perhaps you may find me hiding on AIM at Annalas2007 or MSN at <a href="mailto:annalas2007@hotmail.com">annalas2007@hotmail.com</a>. All messages can be left on Livejournal for Annalas. <br><br>That being said, I suppose it&#39;s back to lurking and reading Slash.<br><br>~Annalas</p>

            <p>Those of you who frequent the Wiki may have noticed the new article about fanmixes. Those of you familiar with my thought process might have guessed that such things were on my mind for a reason, and you would be right. I&#39;m having another crack at it.<br><br>My idea is the same as the last time, i.e. following a day in the life of a PPC Agent with tracks selected only from soundtracks, but I&#39;m attempting a more lighthearted, upbeat, and slightly goofy tone overall. Here&#39;s what I&#39;ve got so far. Format (for now) is:<br><br>Theme - Song Title - Fandom of soundtrack<br><i>With a brief lyric excerpt illustrating my choice, where applicable.</i><br><br>1. Goodficcer&#39;s Lament - The Sound of Silence - Watchmen<br><i>&quot;Hear my words that I might teach you!<br>Take my arms that I might reach you!&quot;<br>But my words like silent raindrops fell<br>And echoed in the wells of silence.</i><br><br>2. Welcome to Headquarters - What Planet Is This?! - Cowboy Bebop<br><i>What planet is this?!</i> Also the crazy jazz and sudden changes in the piece.<br><br>3. The Flowers - Treebeard - Lord of the Rings<br>I like the ominous feeling coupled with the sharp percussion, which throws it off a bit.<br><br>4. Meet the Agents - All for One - Spamalot<br><i>One for one, some for some,<br>Slightly less for the people we don&#39;t like,<br>And a little bit more for me!</i><br>If Arthur is the SO and the knights are the Assassins...<br><br>5. New Partner - What Is This Feeling? - Wicked<br>... Do I need to elaborate?<br><br>6. The Console - The Knight Bus - Harry Potter<br>This is one of the few I kept from last time, because it&#39;s perfect.<br><br>7. Fic Report - All Along the Watchtower (arr. Bear McCreary) - Battlestar Galactica<br><i>&quot;There must be some way outta here,&quot; said the Joker to the Thief.<br>&quot;There&#39;s too much confusion; I can&#39;t get no relief.&quot;<br>...<br>&quot;No reason to get excited,&quot; the Thief he kindly spoke.<br>&quot;Many here among us feel that life is but a joke.&quot;</i><br>Could be the words of the Intelligence agent, or possibly the conversation of the agents getting the report. And it&#39;s just an awesome piece.<br><br>8. The Word World - The World - .hack//SIGN<br><i>You are here alone again<br>In your sweet insanity<br>All too calm, you hide yourself from reality.</i><br>Second one I kept.<br><br>9. A Mary-Sue - Wunderkind - Chronicles of Narnia<br>Pretty self-explanatory.<br><br>10. Riffing the Fic - Vorc Arrives - Farscape<br>Goofy, as if to say WTF? Picks up speed as it goes, and gets darker, like the mood of the agents.<br><br>11. Possession - Delvian Dreams - Farscape<br>Haunting, almost beautiful, but discordant, too.<br><br>12. Bad Slash - Go Go Cactus Man - Cowboy Bebop<br>It... I... look, I&#39;m sorry about this one, but I couldn&#39;t stop laughing, so it had to be done. Blame Barid.<br><br>13. Exorcism - Did They Have to Die Today? - Medieval II: Total War<br>A little bit too serious, but it has a bell in it, and the Latin(?) chanting vaguely fits, too.<br><br>14. Lust Object - I Want You (She&#39;s So Heavy) - Across the Universe<br><br>15. Reading the Charges - Listen Here - House, M.D.<br>The third one I kept as is. It&#39;s like the sax is a litany of scolding, but with a sort of throw-a-party feeling, too.<br><br>16. The Kill - Rock Anthem for Saving the World - Halo<br>I&#39;ve used this song again, but in a different spot.<br><br>17. Neuralyze &amp; Neutralize - Dirty Hands - Battlestar Galactica<br>Sort of an industrial sound appropriate for the disposing of a body, with some other sounds that suggest a neuralyzer.<br><br>18. Bleeprin! - Dr. Mario - Super Smash Bros. Melee<br>Happy feel-good pill-popping!<br><br>19. In FicPsych - Call Me, Call Me - Cowboy Bebop<br><i>I close my eyes and I keep seeing things<br>Rainbow waterfalls, sunny liquid dreams.<br>Confusion creeps inside me raining doubt<br>Got to get to you, but I don&#39;t know how.<br>...<br>Please won&#39;t you call and ease my mind?</i><br><br>20. All in a Day&#39;s Work - Dimension - House, M.D.<br><i>I fell down in the desert baby,<br>I had nothing but a piece of paper, yeah,<br>I had to write something down,<br>And I found myself alone, and then I let go of everything,<br>Into another dimension.</i><br>Good recap and wrap-it-up song. Very energetic.<br><br>** Bonus Track! It&#39;s a surprise.<br><br>** Second Bonus Track! Also a surprise. (Hint: you&#39;ll want to whistle along.)<br><br>Let me know what you think! I may change the order of things before &quot;release.&quot; Any suggestions for that, or for different tracks or themes?<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

Not knowing exactly what you&#39;ve read already, I nevertheless recommend taking the time to visit the <a href="http://plotprotectors.tripod.com/">PPC Lost Tales</a> archive. It is still under construction in places, but since GeoCities went under it is the only place to find some of the stories that were written contemporarily with the Original Series.<br><br>(And everyone, please let me know if you have any issues with the site layout, or spot typos, or anything like that. I&#39;ve recently noticed that the story text overlaps the dragon sidebar on some monitors, and I haven&#39;t fixed everything yet. Also let me know if you&#39;d like to contribute time or data in any way.)<br><br>That said, welcome a&#39;Board!<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p><a href="http://plotprotectors.tripod.com/handbook.html">The PPC Handbook</a>, section D. Several basic charge lists are there. (And I&#39;ll get the Buffy one up eventually, I swear.)<br><br>Of course, you don&#39;t have to follow those exactly when making a charge list, but they might give you an idea of the sorts of things to include. Some, clearly, are going to be worse than others, and often it&#39;s a matter of degree. So the Sue messed up the geography--how badly? So someone is OOC--how much? That&#39;s a judgement call.<br><br>As for the length of the charge list... that&#39;s tricky. You don&#39;t want to have a wall o&#39; text at the end of every mission, but you do want to get across just how badly the Sue (or other subject) messed up. Repeat offenses can of course be lumped into one charge. The littler things can sometimes be left out of the charge list, too (or lumped into one or several of the subjective charges).<br><br>So... does that help? <sup>_<sup>;<br><br>~Neshomeh,</sup></sup> often not sure whether or not she makes sense.</p>

            <p>I tend to have long charge lists, but I usually don&#39;t mention every point on them when charging (all charges have already been mentioned in some way while the agents were collecting charges. So, reading out the full list gives the mission too much redundancy).<br><br>Wall of text though can be avoided by breaking the charging up in paragraphs and by having the agents argue with the Sue about charges. I&#39;m actually amazed how some agents manage to charge a Sue of the grrl/defiant/takes no shit from anyone type without her trying to interrupt even once.</p>

            <p>On the general side: <br><br>Are there any particular cut-off points between when a canon is being Possessed, and when a canon is being Replaced?  The feel I&#39;ve gotten so far is that the answer is whatever works best for the mission report, but cases like a dark-eyed and passive Cregga Rose Eyes seem to have so little in common with the character that it demands the Replacement label.  I think either Agent Trojie or Pads also said that they&#39;d probably need to kill an alive!Sirius personally rather than simply exorcise since he was supposed to be dead.<br><br>What method for dealing with charge lists have you found most effective?

The charge list, in Bad Slash missions, if we&#39;re honest, is mostly a way of keeping the reader informed about why the sporker thinks the fic deserves to be sporked. In-story, the Agents just list whatever crimes (both stylistic and characterisation-based) come up as they come up. And as for incorporating things in exorcisms, well, that&#39;s entirely up to you as to how you do it and what you include - we tend to include charges that are easily &#39;banished&#39;, or basically whatever sounds good. <br><br>&#39;Do you have any recommended sources about the more... physics and biology side of things? Even real life men sometimes find out even basic stuff like that moisturizing soap isn&#39;t really moisturizing enough the unpleasant way, but some of the kinkier stuff I&#39;d be cautious about trying to Google up answers.&#39;<br><br>*cough* Uh, actually ... I should probably find some. The physics and biology side of things relies on my and Pads&#39;s particular interest and knowledge of those subjects, so ... we tend to just remark upon things that we <i>know</i> are wrong. <br><br>I&#39;ll keep an eye out for good resources, though, and of course you&#39;re always welcome to ask me specific questions :)</p>

            <p>Minotaur&#39;s sex tips for slash writers site is an excellent resource written by a now sadly deceased gay man. Never really needed it myself as I got all that info via having a gay best friend in high school, but it&#39;s pretty informative when it comes to the mechanics, positions, common practices, stuff that really wouldn&#39;t work, etc. Should be googleable.</p>

            <p>For me, a big indicator is the name. If a character no longer goes by their real name, there&#39;s a good chance it&#39;s a replacement. In fact, that&#39;s why I killed Nadia/Hermione but not Ginny in the <a href="http://starshadowhall.tripod.com/ppc/dic/03hpdrop.html">HP/DroP mission</a>. (Also I didn&#39;t let it get to the parts where Ginny was in the spotlight and thus more Sue-ified.)<br><br>Of course, there are plenty of instances in which the character retains the name and that is literally the only thing they have in common with the canon character, especially if their defining characteristics are gone, such as you mentioned with Cregga Rose Eyes.<br><br>A character that&#39;s just behaving very strangely is probably possessed--they&#39;re still themselves to some degree, but being forced to act weird due to outside influence. But if the story takes away the things that define them, that&#39;s a replacement. It is a judgement call up to the person writing the mission, but that&#39;s how I look at it.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>If they&#39;re being weird, they&#39;re probably possessed. Even if by &#39;weird&#39; you mean &#39;carrying out actions that they never ever would in canon.&#39; If they&#39;re actually going against defined canon characteristics, they&#39;re probably replacements. <br><br>So, to take Harry Potter as a frequently-possessed-AND-replaced-character;<br><br>If Harry is, for reasons of OMG ANGST, running around killing Death Eaters and having violent angsty sex, distasteful as that is, he&#39;s probably possessed.<br><br>If Harry was born evil, sides with Voldemort and thinks killing anyone he fancies and violent sex is fun, he&#39;s probably a replacement. </p>

I particularly liked that you had her feeling guilty and sort of apologizing in chapter eight.  She does still come off (at least to me) as a Sue because of her Sueish traits, e.g. rare hair and eye colors, special powers, and canon characters spending all this time around her.  <br><br>As for the writing itself: it&#39;s OK to say &quot;brown/green eyes&quot; instead of &quot;chocolate orbs&quot; or &quot;jade optical.&quot;  You might also want to avoid having scenes that are just straight from the movie without anything changed or added - if you want to have a scene that&#39;s the same, try having a character&#39;s thoughts and feelings added or something like that. <br><br>There were some parts that I thought were funny, which is always nice.<br><br></p>

            <p>A few nit-picks first - needs a beta-read! Mostly punctuation issues :) And your stories are cool, but I found it a little hard to get into them at first because the narrative just sort of plunges in without any lead-in or intro. <br><br>Agent Cali&#39;s superpowers ... they&#39;re comical, but as you point out, totally useless. I&#39;d suggest trying to work them in in a way that makes them juuuuust this side of useful - i.e., they can be used but they backfire, rather than just being impossible. He sounds like a LOT of fun though, with the talkative neat freak thing going on. Quite a nice contrast from Miah, who seems like a more typical PPC agent.<br><br>So I&#39;m going to say Permission granted. Do you have a first target picked out? I realise I probably won&#39;t know the fandom, but can I give it a beta before you publish it?<br><br>- Trojie, stretching her new wings.</p>

            <p>Thank you, for permission.<br><br>I know I have punctuation and grammar issues.  I keep trying, and it keeps slipping through my fingers.  <br><br>I have one that I am aiming at with Bryn in Pokemon, but I&#39;m going to pick an NCIS to work on, too.<br><br>I probably should have either put in a lead in summary to those stories or picked something that isn&#39;t from the middle of a longer story.  In fact, I&#39;m going to go label those better right now.<br><br>Maybe Cali can overcome being scared of enclosed spaces so he can actually get some use out of his night vision.  I was afraid to give him stuff that really worked.  I didn&#39;t want him to be over the top with stuff.  I do have a plan for him to try using his whip at some point, and catch Agent Miah instead of the Sue.</p>

            <p>Congrats on getting permission.<br><br>In case you start working on an NCIS story, could you state your claim <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Claimed_Badfic#NCIS">here</a>, so we don&#39;t end up both writing about the same badfic? It&#39;s perhaps a good idea to always state a claim for a fic that is in a fandom other boarders are active in too.</p>

            <p>So I was looking for an Animorphs crossover to throw at Nume and Ilraen, because it really has to happen eventually. To the surprise of no one, there are six listed for Animorphs and Harry Potter.<br><br>And they all look bad. Don&#39;t let the good grammar and spelling in the summaries put you off-guard, but do <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/Animorphs_and_Harry_Potter_Crossovers/54/224/">see for yourself</a>.<br><br>Granted, mostly they&#39;re only mediocre.

I&#39;m just not sure it would make the best mission, seeing as the Animorphs barely show up (though Tobias seems to be acting as Har--as Jake--as that person&#39;s owl }= P ).<br><br>Thoughts? Enraged diatribes? Basically, which one would you most like to see as a mission, and why?<br><br>~Neshomeh, who also notes that three of the six have &quot;shifting&quot; in the title, and raises an eyebrow at it.</p>

            <p>&quot;Shifting Magic&quot; isn&#39;t so bad yet, but Harry and Fenrir are being overly friendly for no real reason, and Fenrir is acting too much like a frightened dog/ugly animal friend.<br><br>&quot;harry or jake&quot; is definitely the worst of the lot, although you&#39;re right that it barely qualifies as a crossover.<br><br>&quot;The Bargin&quot; isn&#39;t exactly terrible, but Ax is being randomly violent, and Draco seems to know who the Ellimist is when they first meet.  I also don&#39;t like that the Ellimist called Draco&#39;s magic &quot;better&quot; than morphing (arguably true, but I don&#39;t think he would say so to the Animorphs&#39; faces).  This would probably be the most interesting mission.</p>

            <p>I kinda skimmed through this fic, and yes, it was abdominable. More than that, there was a genuine Wall Banger in Chapter 14: <i>It was the Ministry of Magic who sold out the cast to the Muggle Zoo in exchange for the extermination of Voldemort and most of his followers. Not just that, but they sold out Harry and the others just because they were under suspicion.</i> So Yeah, pardon my Trope-Speak.</p>

            <p>This story made me quite PISSED.  It casts zoo employees as somewhere between mad scientist and exploiting profiteer.  Believe me, NO ONE works at a zoo for the MONEY, not even the top managers; the majority of a zoo&#39;s yearly admission income goes to the animals&#39; FOOD.  Zoos do not EVER run experiments like the ones Arthur Weasley was put through in this fic, and they would need permission to do so, just like a college science lab does.  Finally, a zoo can only actively breed members of a species if reproduction is considered necessary for that species&#39; survival by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums; the director can&#39;t just decide that he needs more babies of THIS kind or THAT for the spring rush next year.<br><br>That&#39;s all besides the main problem of putting humans in a zoo, of course.  I was so hoping Remus would just massacre all those zookeeper-like people.  What happened to wandless magic, anyway?  I should think McGonagall, Snape and Bellatrix would all be capable of that.<br><br>I apologize for the long, ranting post and the rampant capitalization, but honestly, I was a little offended by that story.</p>

            <pre><code>In the wee hours of the morning a white-furred hand emerged from a mass of sleeping female flesh, searching blindly for something.  It grasped the neck of a large bottle, and the body the arm was attached to emerged from the pile, dull green eyes blearily looking over the empty container.&lt;br&gt;   “Why&#39;s the rum always gone?” the arctic fox muttered to himself, tossing the empty bottle away and standing up unsteadily.  “Ah, that&#39;s why,” he replied to himself before pulling a flask from between the bosom of a passed-out girl and downing the contents.  He needed to go on a booze run, he could feel his perpetual buzz fading.  Sighing loudly, he grabbed a pair of pants and shook off the grasping hands on his legs begging him to come back to the cuddle puddle.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  “The source of my recovery. Sweet shadow taking hold of the light, another day has been devoured Calling me away, begging the question why...” Jack sang along softly to himself as he listened to his MP3 player.  Despite having the attention span of an ADHD child who has just discovered Monster Energy drink he still needed music as a distraction in HQ.  He sang along to Disturbed as he wound his way around the labyrinthine corridors, stopping cold in surprise as he picked up the distinct smell of mating.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;    Turning down the corridor the waft originated from, Jack&#39;s nose led him to a broom closet in the middle-of-...ing-nowhere.  He definitely heard the sounds of a rather... intense... session of lovemaking going on inside, and having the better sense not to interrupt, turned to continue on his way.  Besides, booze called.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;    Meanwhile in the closet, the two paused as they heard the footsteps.&lt;br&gt;    “Ah, I think someone is coming Barid,” Neshomeh commented, pulling a strand of hair out of her sweaty face.&lt;br&gt; “Yeah, its me,” Barid replied with a lecherous grin.

            <p>Barid and Neshomeh were strolling through the halls of HQ, hand in hand, when Neshomeh suddenly spoke up about something that had been on her mind.<br><br>&quot;You know,&quot; she said, &quot;all of this casual sex is nice, but now that you&#39;ve officially got Permission, and Huinesoron and Kaitlyn don&#39;t seem to be around, that makes us the Official PPC Board Couple. And I think that gives us the right to have really fantastic sex with just us if we want to.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I&#39;m down with that,&quot; Barid intoned. &quot;You wanna?&quot;<br><br>Neshomeh did wanna. So, they resolutely didn&#39;t detour from their original path, which brought them quickly to the Lounge. But upon opening the door and looking inside, they found that the best make-out spot was already occupied with Maudlin Hart and Ciri Anekath, who despite being quite young were making up for it with a strong showing of friendly cuddles.<br><br>&quot;Aww,&quot; said the Official PPC Board Couple. They decided to look elsewhere and left the two younger Boarders to themselves.<br><br>&quot;Where else can we go?&quot; Barid asked.<br><br>&quot;Well, there&#39;s a broom cupboard right here,&quot; Neshomeh pointed out. But this too was taken.<br><br>&quot;All right, Jack!&quot; Barid complimented. Jack waved indistinctly from somewhere between Bronwyn and Miah.<br><br>They closed the cupboard door and moved on to the PPC Archives, which seemed a likely prospect as it was quiet inside. However, they had not gotten two feet before Neshomeh tripped over a very familiar body. Her jaw dropped.<br><br>&quot;Hey! You&#39;re agent!me! What are you doing?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Cataloging,&quot; Agent Neshomeh replied innocently.<br><br>&quot;Also taking inventory,&quot; Agent Terri Ryan added from beneath her, far less innocently.<br><br>Boarder!Neshomeh turned around and left in a hurry, muttering something about awkward and not needing to see that. Barid did not help matters by commenting that they should go back there later and spend some time with just the <i>three</i> of them.<br><br>The pair continued down the corridor until they came to a likely-looking door. They walked through it and found themselves on the ceiling.<br><br>&quot;Oh, great. An Escher room,&quot; said Neshomeh.<br><br>Barid did not respond immediately, as he was too busy gaping at the scene before them. Trojie, Cassie, Sara, Techno-Dann, and July were arranged in various states of undress and gravitational orientation more or less centered on Lux, who held a book open in her hand and was giving the others pointers.<br><br>&quot;So you see,&quot; she was saying, &quot;position 51 IS physically possible if you do it like <i>this</i>!&quot;<br><br>There was a chorus of pleased &quot;Ohhh!&quot;s from her pupils.<br><br>&quot;Where can <i>we</i> get a copy of that?&quot; Barid wondered.<br><br>&quot;Maybe we can borrow it when they&#39;re done,&quot; said Neshomeh. &quot;But they&#39;re busy right now. Come on. There has to be SOME place that&#39;s free!&quot;<br><br>They left the Escher room and headed for FicPsych, figuring it was probably the department with the most discreet rooms in it and nobody would mind if they borrowed one. By this time, they were both feeling rather inspired by the scenes they had witnessed, and they were eager to get on with it. They knocked on the doors until it was opened by Nurse Mirrad.<br><br>&quot;Hello,&quot; said Neshomeh.<br><br>&quot;Can we borrow a room?&quot; Barid asked.<br><br>&quot;I&#39;m afraid that is not possible,&quot; the Minbari replied. &quot;We are rather... busy... in here at the moment.&quot;<br><br>At this time, they noticed that he was not wearing his usual robes, and one sock was missing. For a Minbari, this is an advanced state of undress requiring at least three hours of ritual.<br><br>As if to confirm their suspicions, a green tendril worked its way elegantly around Mirrad&#39;s middle and pulled him inexorably back toward the department&#39;s interior.<br><br><i>Come, Mirrad,</i> a husky, feminine voice intoned. <i>We are all waiting for you.</i><br><br>&quot;I didn&#39;t know he wore a bowler hat,&quot; Barid remarked as the doors shut firmly.<br><br>&quot;He doesn&#39;t,&quot; said Neshomeh. &quot;I can only think of one... oh, my.&quot; She broke off, blushing. &quot;Well, we figured it had to happen sometime...&quot;<br><br>They tried the pool next, but found that BattleHamster and Honu_Wahine were already using the water slide to great effect. The nearby locker room was occupied by the whole of the All-HQ Indoor Rules Quidditch League (though the pair was rather puzzled by how Lux could be in there, having been giving lessons in the Escher room less than ten minutes ago), so that was right out. In DoSAT they were confronted with the very odd sight of Piph enjoying herself thoroughly with robot!Piph.<br><br>&quot;Day-um,&quot; said Barid. &quot;I didn&#39;t know robot!Piph had those kinds of attachments.&quot;<br><br>In desperation, they tried the SO&#39;s office, but the Sunflower was unwilling to give up his desk, which was covered in yellow roses.<br><br>&quot;Good grief!&quot; Neshomeh exclaimed in frustration. &quot;We should&#39;ve known better than to try this in HQ. We want somewhere UNoccupied, so everywhere we go, someone is there!&quot;<br><br>Barid nodded. &quot;Okay. So. We have to think of someplace no one in their right mind--scratch that--where no one EVER would willingly have sex.&quot;<br><br>They looked at each other. &quot;Kitchen.&quot; They nodded.<br><br>They took off at a run, pausing at the Fountain of Bleepka in the hopes that imbibing some of its contents would help them navigate HQ more easily, but Laburnum and doctorlit were in the way. Enthusiastically.<br><br>When they finally got as far as the cafeteria, they regretted the lack of Bleepka even more, as Gen and Makari were doing unspeakable things on the cafeteria buffet. But they had become so desperate by this time that they passed the two women without a word, and finally found themselves inside the kitchen.<br><br>They looked around cautiously.<br><br>&quot;I THINK we&#39;re alone,&quot; Neshomeh opined.<br><br>&quot;Yup,&quot; said Barid. &quot;Nobody over here, either.&quot;<br><br>They shared a massive sigh of relief and fell into each other&#39;s arms.<br><br>&quot;You know, we always said we should never do this in the kitchen,&quot; Neshomeh said with a teasing grin.<br><br>&quot;Well of course, but we were talking about OUR kitchen. This isn&#39;t,&quot; said Barid.<br><br>&quot;True.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Why are you still wearing pants?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Dunno. We should fix that.&quot;<br><br>&quot;We <i>should</i>.&quot;<br><br>And they did.<br><br>~*~<br><br>And THAT&#39;S how it&#39;s done. *g*<br><br>~Neshomeh and Barid</p>

            <p>I&#39;m glad to be here for this one, though! Mwahahaha...<br><br>***<br><br>There was a giggle as the small group flopped back to the unfeasibly large bed, most of them very noticeably out of breath. &quot;Ooof, Trojie, you - sat on my hand!&quot; giggled one young brunette, squirming to free said appendage.<br><br>&quot;&#39;S not my fault you had it somewhere it could <i>be</i> sat on,&quot; Trojie grumbled as she wriggled to the left a bit, giving Sara her hand back.<br><br>&quot;On the plus side, it&#39;s a good thing you sneaked this book out of Lux&#39;s collection,&quot; Techno-Dann pointed out as he manouevred himself out of the heap with judicious use of his elbows and reached for the tome in question, currently lying on the floor beside the bed. &quot;Look, we&#39;ve managed numbers five through twelve, eighteen, twenty-three and thirty-seven.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Oooh, can we try <i>that</i> one?&quot; July asked, leaning over his shoulder and pointing to one of the highly detailed pictures.<br><br>&quot;We can try, except... um.&quot; He held the book further away, then closer, trying to work out exactly where the intertwined figures&#39; bits and pieces were. &quot;I don&#39;t actually think this is physically possible.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Rubbish.&quot; She pulled the book out of his hands and waved it at Trojie. &quot;You&#39;re the anatomy know-how-y person, how do we do this one?&quot;<br><br>There was silence for a few minutes as they awaited her verdict with bated breath. Finally, she put the book back on the floor, page carefully held open, and tugged the other three towards her with a grin.<br><br>&quot;Well, it sort of goes like <i>this</i>...&quot; she began, though the squeals and other assorted noises soon drowned her out completely.</p>

Tonsil-hockey and the like.<br><br>&quot;What do we do with him, now?&quot; Bryn asked bouncing in place.<br><br>&quot;Man he stinks of rum, and whiskey, and *sniff*  *sniff* beer.&quot;  Looking suddenly concerned, Miah turned to Bryn and asked, &quot;How much tranquilyzer did you put in that dart?&quot;<br><br>Bryn checked her supplies, and answered sheepishly, &quot;Only enough to knock out an elephant.&quot;  She looked worried for a moment, before brightening (remarkably literally).  &quot;It&#39;s okay, his metabolism only works right when he&#39;s really, really drunk.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Hey, that gives me an idea!  Let&#39;s do that thing from the song about the Drunken Sailor!&quot;  Miah shouted.<br><br>&quot;Which bit? The shaving his stomach and dumping him the captains daughters bed? Actually thats a good idea... except... maybe that&#39;s too mundane.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I say we figure it out later and get to work on shaving; because that is the hairiest gut I&#39;ve ever seen.&quot;<br><br>&quot;With all this fur, we could write something funny on his stomach.&quot;  Miah said grinning evilly.<br><br>&quot;Ooh, how about...Fan!brat!&quot;  Bryn said, adding her evil smile and cackle to the atmosphere of The Lair. <br><br>When they finished, they rolled Jack up in a sheet, because dragging a body through the corridors in a sheet, is WAY less conspicuous than without one.  They passed through the lobby again, but July and Myon were too, um, engaged, to notice them this time.   They traded lines from The Dead Parrot Sketch so they wouldn&#39;t notice where they were headed.<br><br>&quot;Excuse me, miss?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Who you calling miss?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I&#39;m sorry I&#39;ve got a cold.&quot;<br><br>&quot;What seems to be the--How we&#39;d get here so fast?&quot;<br><br>They knew they were facing the door of The Pad because, of the fancy black script on the ominous (yet identical to all the others) grey door. As they pushed on it, the door gave the satisfying creeEEEaak all doors should have.<br><br>As they entered they were faced with the Pad (not to be confused with Agent Pads) which had a very confused but somewhat amused trio of Boarders stuck in it all sitting in their own corners. <br><br>The movie they were watching was decidedly, interesting, and Bryn ran screaming &quot;My eyes!  My eyes!  Where&#39;s the bleeprin?&quot;<br><br>Miah politely ignored their choice of entertainment, and dragged the sheet to the middle of the room.<br><br>Trojie said, &quot;A heavy sheet?&quot;  (Her brain was slightly melty from the movie.)<br><br>Techno Dann and Makari came over and poked Jack through the sheet.  The tranquillizer seemed to be wearing off, because Jack started trying to squirm out of the sheet.<br><br>&quot;We found him like this in the hall,&quot;  Miah said giving her very best Newbie innocent look.  &quot;Have fun!&quot;  She gave a rather less than innocent wink, as she backed out of the room.<br><br>A dazed Jack sat up, and the sheet fell into his lap.<br><br>&quot;A Fan!Brat!  Get him!&quot;  shouted Troijie.<br><br>&quot;It&#39;s just like the the movie,&quot; Makari added.<br><br>&quot;This is going to be fun,&quot; Techno Dann added.<br><br>Jack looked a bit panicked at slightly predatory the looks on the faces surrounding him, but then he caught sight of the movie.  &quot;Alright!  I&#39;ve always dreamed of waking up in this movie.&quot;<br><br>Miah closed the door feeling a little miffed.  Their plan hadn&#39;t quite worked out the way they planned.  Oh well, it&#39;ll still take a while for the hair to gr--<br><br>&quot;Fan!Brat!  What happened to my belly hair?!&quot;  It was faint, but it put the smile back on Miah&#39;s face.  Now just to find Bryn.<br><br>Miah found Bryn next to the archive, frantically sending Steve morse code messages.  Of course, Steve hadn&#39;t responded back yet.  That took a few hours.  Miah grabbed Bryn and dragged her to the Bleepka fountain and ducked her until Bryn stopped gibbering about sporking her eyes out over the movie.<br><br>Now that the bad memories were gone, she was free to have a giggling fit over Jack only being worried about his fur.  Miah suggested they get more snacks and go back to hiding in their unfindable cushion fort.  It was time for more Boarder hunting!<br></p>

            <p>(I assume Jack gave you lot his permission to use him in these things...)<br><br>Jack had finally escaped from the Pad, his captors at last passing out in a state of bliss after the prolonged and sweaty session with their movie and then him. He staggered somewhat drunkenly through the halls, occasionally looking down at his stomach and then sighing mournfully when he saw that the shameful words were still inscribed there.<br><br>It was in one of these moments that he ran into something. It was like walking into a wall, only softer. He looked up and found himself face to chest with what might have been a bear. With glasses.<br><br>&quot;Erp?&quot; said Jack.<br><br>&quot;Hi,&quot; said Barid. &quot;Why so down?&quot;<br><br>&quot;They shaved my stomach hair!&quot; Jack wailed. &quot;And it will take WEEKS to grow in!&quot; He stepped back to show off the damage.<br><br>&quot;Hmm, I see,&quot; said Barid. &quot;Well, cheer up! I think I can help. Come with me.&quot; He took Jack by the hand and led him into a side room. &quot;You see,&quot; he went on, removing his shirt, &quot;I have enough to share.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Oh, wow!&quot; said Jack, overcome with awe. &quot;What can I do to repay you?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I can think of something,&quot; said Barid with his trademark huge grin.<br><br>A few minutes later, Jack paused in his activities. &quot;Wait... aren&#39;t you engaged or something?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yeah,&quot; Barid agreed. &quot;But the last I checked, Neshomeh was busy elsewhere. I&#39;m sure she won&#39;t mind.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Oh. Cool!&quot; said Jack. And they went back to giving the term &quot;hairy lot&quot; a whole new meaning.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p><i>15 minutes before Barid meets Jack</i><br><br>&quot;Where are we going?&quot; asked Neshomeh.  &quot;You still haven&#39;t told me.  You also haven&#39;t explained why I need a blindfold or what you had in that bag that you had over your shoulder.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Wouldn&#39;t want to ruin the surprise,&quot; explained Barid, with just a little too much mirth in his voice.  &quot;We&#39;ll be there soon.&quot;<br><br>Another two minutes of walking brought them to their destination.  There was a brief pause as Barid opened a door.  The sounds of giggling reached Neshomeh&#39;s ears.<br><br>&quot;In you go,&quot; said Barid, steering Neshomeh into the room.  &quot;She&#39;s all yours, ladies.&quot;<br><br>There was a soft thud as Barid put the bag down.  He then left the room.<br><br>As Neshomeh took off the blindfold, she found herself in a room that was covered in pillows and blankets.  It was also filled with various female Boarders in various states of undress and compromising positions.  Neshomeh looked at the bag on the floor and was shocked to see the collection of interesting items inside.<br><br>Piph walked over and grinned.  She took Neshomeh&#39;s hand and led her to a corner that was less covered in Boarders than the rest.  They were quickly joined by Gen, who had stopped to grab a pair of fuzzy pink handcuffs from the bag.<br><br>-------<br><br>After about 30 minutes of fun, Neshomeh was pulled back to reality by a frantic scratching at the door.<br><br>&quot;That&#39;s probably Lux,&quot; said Trojie from inside a very interesting game of Twister.  &quot;Barid said he sent her an invitation.&quot;<br><br>Laburnum pulled herself halfway out of a pile near the door and opened it.  There was an excited squeal from the other side and then the party really started.</p>

            <p>I suppose it&#39;s up to me :P And what better way to start than a nice, all-inclusive orgy?<br><br>***<br><br>The PPC is sharing and caring. Those who frequent the Board would be the first to say so. The arrival of a newbie is greeted with a veritable Dionysian frenzy of gift-giving. <br><br>Recently, there have been many, many newbies arriving. Regular Boarders were very pleased about this. *Very* pleased.<br><br>&#39;They&#39;re so flexible!&#39; said Techno-Dann muffledly from approximately the middle of the pile. &#39;Look!&#39; There was a pleased squeak from a portion of the happy agglomeration of Boarders that resembled Bronwyn.<br><br>&#39;I know!&#39; July exclaimed. &#39;Behold!&#39;<br><br>&#39;Now now, they&#39;re not puppets,&#39; Neshomeh chided gently.<br><br>&#39;Not complaining!&#39; a Piph-sounding voice spoke up.<br><br>There was immediately a chorus of assent. July grinned.<br><br>&#39;Fast learners too,&#39; Sara commented. <br><br>&#39;Well hopefully,&#39; Laburnum said, sitting up and earning a slightly disappointed sound from Barid. &#39;Everyone having fun?&#39; she called out to the group as a whole.<br><br>There was an immediate and ragged a capella rendition of &#39;Yes miss&#39; performed by a dozen-or-so voices. <br><br>&#39;Excellent. Welcome to the PPC Board!&#39;<br><br>***<br><br>A/N: I&#39;m working on better plots, but I wanted to get the ball rolling. C&#39;mon guys, let&#39;s have some cracky fun.

Very, very odd.<br><br>(We have <i>&quot;Did you know she was a Suethor?&quot; // &quot;That was only one-shot fic!&quot; // &quot;One-shots still with epic plotholes--&quot; // &quot;And she&#39;s sunk to greater depths!&quot; // &quot;Don&#39;t you tempt me to write shipfic--&quot; // &quot;Tempt her!

            <p>I only skimmed through parts of the first chapter (I&#39;ll work through the rest and give my thoughts), but I want to ask this question: Why didn&#39;t this person make it an original fiction?<br>Obviously he or she knows the canon well, but if an author is going to twist the canon so much until it is pretty much unrecognizable, why don&#39;t they make it original? It&#39;s not like you have to write fanfic to prove that you&#39;re a fan of this ship or that ship or a crossover involving a pirate ship. <br>Whatever. At least the grammar and spelling isn&#39;t horrible. I&#39;ll stomach this as long as I can pretend that the only thing in common with this fic and the Harry Potter series is the names. (The fact that I&#39;m not a Harmonian might make it even easier, actually.)</p>

            <p>Personally I prefer fics where Ron is conflicted, but gradually comes around, where Molly&#39;s biases (if she has any prejudices at all) are subconscious and ground into the bone so much that she doesn&#39;t realize it and Ginny...<br><br>I don&#39;t have nuthin&#39; against Ginny before HBP, but she was being such a snit to Fleur that I couldn&#39;t read anymore.
