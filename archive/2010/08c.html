            <p>I think I already said my money&#39;s on Cluny if he goes against mortal Drip, as Drip&#39;s a serial rapist who, according to what I&#39;ve seen of canon, only kills women he attacks, who are presumably helpless. Cluny has battle experience, and as was mentioned before, a frickin poison tail barb. Now Demon-Drip, on the other hand, would have a much better chance, but I&#39;d still say Cluny, simply because he&#39;s better equipped and Drip doesn&#39;t have much in the way of power. His only advantage would therefore be size.<br><br>I propose my own, now. Joel Calley (with Miranda&#39;s help) from the webcomic Concession versus Damien from El Goonish Shive.</p>

            <p>Drip&#39;s only weapon was occasional use of a gun, which would kind of be cheating.

            <p>Hey, it&#39;s me, Asheel, who of course none of you know because I&#39;m completely new. . . I&#39;m a little nervous.  I&#39;m a bit of a serial lurker, and this is my first post online.  I&#39;m a fan of Pratchett, Nix, Westerfeld, and Kage Baker, as well as being a bit of a webcomic addict.  My favorite book is currently &quot;Heroes by Necessity&quot;  I ran across mentions of this place on tvtropes.org around this time last year and I really enjoy the atmosphere.  Um, that&#39;s it for me.  </p>

            <p>Hail to all of you brave and wonderful people out there :-) <br>I am new to the board but not so new to PPC. I&#39;ve already read all of TOS and most other stories stored/linked to from there.<br>Me and one or two of my friends (MSTers) were wondering if the PPC has any foreign language units. I am from the Czech Republic and I would love to spread the tradition of PPC to my homecountry and my mothertongue. Would it be possible to obtain a Permission for a non-english PPCing?</p>

            <p>Nice to meet you. :)  <br><br>I think the others have answered your question pretty thoroughly already, but I&#39;ll just add my two cents as PG: Although I wouldn&#39;t be able to read your non-English missions, I think it&#39;d be great if you would write them, and have no problem with it. Yes, I&#39;d need to see a writing sample in English, but I wouldn&#39;t nitpick you on grammar and spelling details since they wouldn&#39;t be relevant, and since you&#39;re not obliged to speak English perfectly to write in another language (I noticed a pluralisation mistake in your reply to IndeMaat, for example; should you want to write missions in English at some point, I&#39;d strongly recomment a beta reader, but not for writing in Czech). Instead I would just look for style and plot. So by all means, once your waiting-month up over, please do apply!<br><br>Also, here are the Links we give to all newbies, minus those that you&#39;ve obviously already seen. They should be useful: <br><br>* The <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Killed_Badfic">List of Killed Badfic</a>, which will direct you to a large number of non-Original PPC Missions.<br>* The <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/PPC_Board_Constitution">Board Constitution</a><br>* The <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/FAQ:_The_Board">FAQ: For the Board</a><br>* Our <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/PPC_Wiki">PPC Wiki</a><br>* The very-important-to-read-before-requesting-Permission <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Permission">Permission article</a><br>* Our <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Guide_To_The_PPC">Guide To The PPC</a><br>* The <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Mission_Writing_Guide">Mission Writing Guide</a><br>* The <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Slash-Sporking_Guide">Slash-Sporking Guide</a><br>* The <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/FAQ:_For_Newbies">FAQ: For Newbies</a>.<br>* The <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/the_ppc/20306.html">List of Everything PPC</a> <br><br><br>Again, good to meet you!</p>

            <p>are manifold. You could say I am as geeky as they come ;-)<br>Of the series it&#39;s Life on Mars, Dr. Who (+Torchwood), SG, BSG, TBBT, Lie to me, House MD, Defying Gravity. From the bookverses I like Harry Potter, Sherlock Holmes and Honor Harrington, among others. I can find my way around the Mass Effect- and Starcraftverses of the game variety. And I also quite fancy webcomicses namely XKCD, Questionable Content, Abstruse Goose and Ensign Sue Must Die :-)<br>I plan to send my agents to Potterverse and crossovers thereof but that is mostly because it is the most Sue-infested in my country. If I ever grow enough balls to enter the murky waters of bad slash, I might bring together a team for Sherlock Holmes fics...</p>

            <p>I quit watching it after about the 5-6 episode. I felt like they were trying extremely hard to imitate the styles of other shows, instead of keeping with their own style. Plus there was not a single character that I actually either liked or loved to hate. Without one or the other, I found myself unable to engage with the stories.<br><br>Rush started out quite hate-able, but then they gave him a cop-out free pass with the caffeine/nicotine withdrawel. I really didn&#39;t care for the kid. Aw what was his name, not Noah, Michael, Matt. Eh, can&#39;t remember. I am not very good with names. Then there was hero boy that liked to have sex in closets. He would be almost empathetic, then go do something stupid. The Colonel was interesting, but seemed to not get enough air time at that point to get to know him.<br><br>I hated the use of the stones. They have uber experts in the Ancient language and technology like Carter, Daniel, and Rodney and instead they keep bringing a dumb@ss that does nothing but cause trouble by giving stupid orders? They didn&#39;t seem to be all that interested in exploring the ship. They couldn&#39;t even get the computers to work, and didn&#39;t even seem to think of trying to consult an expert while they were on Earth. <br><br>I really hope the show grows up some over time, and then I might start watching it. I was a late comer to SG-1. It was something like season 6 that I first started watching it. I thought the whole Ori arc was pretty lame, and I haven&#39;t managed to finish watching it yet. It turns out that my favorite seasons are 1-3, 6 (I am a big fan of Jonas, even though that goes against the mainstream), and maybe 7-8. I&#39;m working through watching them all in order, and I am on Season 7 right now.<br><br>I hated Atlantis when I first saw it. Mostly, I hated Rodney. He was loud, obnoxious, and annoying. He seemed on my first impression to have no redeeming qualities (boy did I miss a lot on that first impression!). Anyway, I came back to it on Season 2, and loved it. Rodney is my favorite character, even over Sheppard. I could go on for a long while as to why Rodney is a great character. <br><br>I want to continue with the Stargate franchise, so I hope that when I go back to Universe in season 2 or 3 that I will find that I like it. I&#39;m still keeping my options open to someday like it.<br><br>PS: Yes, 4th Doctor, Tom Baker</p>

            <p>Eventhough I found &quot;my&quot; character in Rush, so I have a reason to watch. It gets slightly better over time, especially between him and colonel Young.<br>The rest of the characters are...lame. Not thought out properly. Deranged, maybe. The kid (Eli) has no brain of his own, despite being a freaking genius. The guy sexing in closets (Lt. Matthew Scott) is torn between his past and his present and has fallen for the really dumb late-senator&#39;s daughter (Chloe).<br>Well, end of ramble. I think the basic idea is great. However the script does not live up to it.<br><br>As for SG-1, it went downhill ever since RDA left the show. My personal favourite seasons are 1-5. After they started yo-yoing with Daniels ascensions it lost a part of its appeal.<br><br>As for Atlantis, I loved Elizabeth best. At first I was also quite into Teyla, but they killed her potential as they brought Ronon to the team. And the 4th season just burried it. Rodney is great. Eventhough different script writers seemed to have very different oppinions about what is he really like. Shepp is too much of a superhero and womanizer for me to really appreciate him but he had a great chemistry with Rodney sometimes.<br><br>All in all I love the SG worlds because they brought me to sci-fi and everything fandom, so I find it hard to just condemn it, even in spite of it&#39;s many shortcommings.</p>

            <p>Definitely my favorite moments with Sheppard almost all center around interactions with Rodney. He gets a few good moments in with Ronon in the last season. I liked their interaction in the building collapse episode. My favorite fanfic is always about McKay and Sheppard (not slash), it is sometimes hard to find good ones, but I keep trying.<br><br>I was pretty ticked off at the writers over the last couple of seasons. I didn&#39;t mind so much that they brought Carter to Atlantis, but they killed off a great character to bring her in and then didn&#39;t even use her character&#39;s strengths. They made her not a super genius fix it person, which made it totally pointless to have her there. I did end up really liking Woolsey in the leader role, though. The show would have fared better if they had put him in directly after Weir.<br><br>Then the last several episodes seemed like they had went over to FFnet and stole a bunch of fanfic. It really felt like they were just going through the motions, biding their time to get to Universe.<br><br>Ok, ok, I promised some goodfic, didn&#39;t I?

I hereby present you with a bag of pebbles and a Random Shiny Object as gifts of welcome.<br><br>As far as I&#39;m aware, the PPC doesn&#39;t have foreign language units as such; I know of at least one mission tackling a fic that was written in French (of a sort), but no specific groups who write for the PPC in other languages.<br><br>That said, I can&#39;t see anything that would prevent it, but I very much doubt many other PPCers would be able to understand it. Besides, we&#39;re not really about spreading the PPC in specific places. It&#39;s just a place where a bunch of people gather to share their fanfiction gripes and mock them good-naturedly.

            <p>About the spreading, I didn&#39;t actually mean trying to recruit people or anything like that.

            <p>Though many of the PPCers are native speakers of other languages than English, I&#39;m not sure whether there are actually any non-English PPC stories.

            <p>I know they will want to read something from me in English and personally I don&#39;t have a problem with English. It&#39;s just that a surprising number of people here is not able to read in English, at least not well enough to get the MSTs or PPCs written in English (not to mention the bastardized English in the badfics themselves).

            <p>Each fandom has it&#39;s own &quot;favourite victims&quot; so to speak. If you know the fandom you can look pointedly. <br>Eg. in Harry Potter it is usually a good shot to look for Severus Snape and/or Draco Malfoy as main characters. Also most of the Marauder time fics will be &quot;worth it&quot;. In Stargate: Atlantis it would be mostly Shepp-fics.<br>It also helps to know what type of transgressions you are usually dealing with in your fandom.<br>Eg. Badslash in Sherlock Holmes or Mary Sue inserts/possessions in Potter (eventhough there is a fair deal of badslash and others there too).</p>

            <p>Generally, if I&#39;m actually trying to find badfic, I&#39;ll run a word-search for &quot;sister&quot; in a fandom where there are no canonical sisters, and it&#39;ll inevitably turn up some sister-of-a-canon-character Mary Sues. <br><br>It depends on what kinds of badfic you&#39;re searching for, of course. The above applies for Mary Sues. If you were after bad slash, searching for an absurd pairing would probably turn up a number of worthy results, as would searching for common pairings and keywords for scenarios that would never fit them - &quot;wimpy&quot; or &quot;weeping&quot; come to mind. More generally, you could search for evidence of lazy-chatspeak typing, which usually indicates laziness, if not outright rubbish - things like &quot;PLZ R&amp;R&quot; or &quot;!!!1!!1!!!&quot; or &quot;koolies&quot; or things like that. <br><br>Hope that helps.<br><br><br>(Will you do us a favour, though? When you post badifc links, please give a summary and some details of why it&#39;s so bad in your post, rather than just the links. Also, it&#39;s good to be in the habit of capitaling names like &quot;Star Trek&quot; - we don&#39;t want to sink to the level of badfic writers, after all.)</p>

            <p>Firstly, I&#39;ve never seen your name before, and I <i>have</i> been here a lot lately. You&#39;ve never made an introduction post or joined in any other threads before that I have seen. No offense - we always like to meet new people - but suddenly making this choice for us without ever really joining our community in the first place is rather rude. No, you didn&#39;t offend (me, at least), but it&#39;s not exactly welcome.<br><br>I also don&#39;t like the idea of a Facebook page for our community, mainly because we all go by pennames and Facebook is, by definition, a place where one goes by their real name. I&#39;m not about to connect the two.<br><br>So I&#39;m sorry, but I, at least, will not be having anything to do with that Facebook page. I&#39;d rather it was deleted, to be honest. That said, please don&#39;t turn and run because your first post here was a mistake; go ahead and make an introduction post, start afresh, and join our community properly. Everyone&#39;s welcome.</p>

            <p>It&#39;s one thing if individual PPCers want to be friends on Facebook, but I don&#39;t know how comfortable I am with the idea of anyone at all being able to connect the PPC with my real name that easily. I&#39;m not particularly shy about the fact that I&#39;m involved here, mind you, but I&#39;d prefer it to be up to me who finds out, and how. Also, I hate to imagine what would happen if angry fanbrats who&#39;ve been PPCed found their way there. Which is probably inevitable.<br><br>So, I don&#39;t know about anyone else, but I&#39;m not about to join. I second everything IndeMaat said, too.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>You&#39;re telling me! Can you believe the spaced-out nutjob (he&#39;s got to be constantly high on something) actually posted 44 stories on ff.net?

            <p>Since they seem unaware that she has any power over them personally, as opposed to over reality in general (she can alter reality to make it a fact that she was promoted, but she can&#39;t make Kirk kiss her), they may not be aware themselves of how they did it, so questioning them (with or without coercion) would be pointless. Perhaps positioning some sort of spy on the Enterprise to observe them more closely would be helpful.</p>

            <p>It would have to be someone who knew Star Trek pretty well, and had enough self-control not to kill, maim or otherwise interfere with Sue before their observation time was up. There must be enough extras hanging around for them to blend in for a good long while, as long as they avoided getting into a situation where Sue adopted them as her best friend or some other acquaintance (e.g. boyfriend from the Academy who still pines for her and will at some point press his advances so she has to be saved by the man of her choice). While there is precedent for that (in TOS with Andromielle) and agents have their own immunity to the Sue-spell, it would also draw attention to the agent and he or she wouldn&#39;t have immunity to any attempts made by the canon characters to get rid of him or her as an adjunct to Sue.<br>Not sure who would be most suitable, though. Is there anyone in Intelligence who might be able (and willing) to do it as a one-shot mission? :)</p>

            <p>I&#39;m sorry, but there are several issues, mostly with your writing sample, that are too glaring to be overlooked or let by with warnings for you to keep in mind while writing. <br><br>Most overtly, your grammar needs work. The only spelling error I found was &quot;she <b>dies</b> her hair bright red&quot;, but both your biographies and writing sample (and some posts here on the Board, actually) are missing capitals, use numerals where they shouldn&#39;t, and there are a <i>lot</i> of commas missing, as well as some other punctuation marks. Some examples: <br><br>* <i>24 years old</i><br>- In prose, numbers this low should be written out: &quot;twenty-four years old&quot;.<br><br>The following are all missing commas, which I have inserted to illustrate:<br>* <i>Department: All-purpose Department<u><b>,</b></u> Star Trek Division</i><br>* <i>to have to share his RC with a woman<u><b>,</b></u> mostly because</i><br>* <i>Being from the north of England<u><b>,</b></u> he speaks with</i><br><br>* <i>Shrugging decided to make a new message to kill some time.</i><br>- This should be: &quot;Shrugging<b>, he</b> decided&quot;.<br><br>* <i>from acting Captain of Engineering Joel of a nameless Federation star ship</i><br>- I&#39;ve watched practically every filmed minute of <i>Star Trek</i>, and I&#39;ve never heard of a &quot;Captain of Engineering&quot;; it&#39;s always been &quot;chief engineer&quot;. I believe &quot;Acting Captain&quot; is a title that therefore requires both words to be capitalised, though that can be argued. Within the <i>Star Trek</i> world, &quot;starship&quot; is always one word, and I <i>highly</i> doubt it is nameless; all ships (save for Borg ones, I guess) have names (and Borg ships have designations). If he simply doesn&#39;t remember the name due to this amnesia, it should be very easy to look up, given that even if the computer were inactive and unable to supply the data, all Federation ships have name plaques on their Bridge. I realise this is supposed to be from an incomplete fanfic, but why couldn&#39;t you pick a name anyway?<br><br>* <i> An event seems to have occurred where I do not remember the crew</i><br>- At the very least, &quot;where&quot; should be &quot;which&quot;, but this sentence really needs to be rephrased to something like, &quot;which has left me with no memory of the crew&quot;, or &quot;that has caused me to lose all memory of...&quot;  Also, this seems like a very foolish thing for someone to announce on an open channel, given he doesn&#39;t know where he is and that there are pleanty of people even within Federation territory who would be quick to capture a lone starship with all its advanced and expensive technology.<br><br>* <i>hadn’t used the words lonely or bored at all very professional.</i><br>- This really should be: &quot;hadn&#39;t used the words &quot;lonely&quot; or &quot;bored&quot; at all - very professional.&quot; (though the dash, of course, can be replaced with a comma or even a semi-colon at will).<br><br>* <i>(A few minutes before)</i><br>- Nothing technically wrong, but there is really no need for this, given how easy it would be for Sarah&#39;s diary entry to appear in italicised prose in the middle of the scene rather than before it. That is, of course, a matter of style, but if you insist on using this, I would strongly suggest having it italicised rather than in brackets, and that you use the word &quot;earlier&quot; rather than &quot;before&quot;, following convention.<br><br>* <i>“Excuse me can you tell me how to get to...”</i><br>There needs to be a comma after &quot;me&quot; and a question mark after the elipsis. However, since she is being interrupted, the elipsis should be a dash or a hyphen, like so: &quot;Excuse me, can you tell me how to get to-?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Starfleet&quot; is one word, with a captial &quot;S&quot; - it is neither &quot;star Fleet&quot; or &quot;Star Fleet&quot;. &quot;<i>Star Trek</i>&quot; (referring to the fandom) should always be capitalised and (preferably) italicised. &quot;World One&quot; is a name and so both words need to be capitalised. There are a few other instances of missing capitals. You also have a habit of using the word &quot;fairly&quot; at every opportunity, sometimes in very close succession. <br><br>A good beta would solve most of these problems. However, I find it hard to believe that you could have missed the inconsistancies, if nothing else, which gives me the impression that you didn&#39;t spend a great deal of time on this, or even re-read what you&#39;d written before submitting it. That is not exactly a point in your favour.<br><br>In terms of the content, I have no significant issues with your agents. They are somewhat bland, but have room to grow and a decent amount of contrast that could make for some good comedy. I&#39;m more concerned by the blandness of the writing itself; simply put, there is nothing about your writing sample that is different from all the other partner-meets-partner stories around, and subjective though it is, you didn&#39;t make me laugh. To be fair, because we ask everyone to follow the same broad outlines there will always be similarities, but there was not one thing in your character interactions that will stick in my mind. This itself isn&#39;t grounds for denying Permission, but I want to mention it anyway.<br><br>A more minor point, but your bio says that Joel was from a fic that &quot;<i>was dropped before anything more than a character sheet was created.</i>&quot;  Offhand, I don&#39;t believe that a mere character sheet can create a character; I think it&#39;s the posting of a fanfic that enables it to affect the canon and enlivens it to the point that characters can be recruited. <br><br>Finally, you haven&#39;t exactly been the most active member of our community. Since your own introductary post, you&#39;ve mostly just greeted other newbies. The other posts that you have made or replied to tend to be very short, contributing little to the conversation. When I came and saw your Permission request, my first thought was, &quot;Who is that?&quot;, followed shortly by, &quot;it can&#39;t have been a month yet, can it?&quot; because I was under the impression that you were still a relative newbie.<br><br>So I&#39;m sorry, but I cannot grant you Permission. I advise you to stick around, chat a bit more, make a point of continuing some conversations, and get a beta-reader for your re-write. Also, don&#39;t be afraid to give a little more description and depth to your writing; we&#39;re here to enrich the world of the PPC, not use as few words as possible to narrate a mission. <br><br>And last, don&#39;t be discouraged. You&#39;re not the first person to be denied Permisson, or even the first person I&#39;ve had to deny. I hope you try again.</p>

            <p>It&#39;s the rank when a Captain is also Chief Engineer its is mentioned in one of the films. The ship is nameless becuase all the details are taken directly from a summary I wrote a number of years ago, he also has no last name. I&#39;ll ask again in a month or so.</p>

            <p>Well, I still disagree; if you mean Scotty, for example, he held the rank of captain but was in the position of chief engineer, but those were fairly special circumstances (stealing a ship and all to run off and save his friend); if the chief engineer is acting as captain (like Trip Tucker did in some <i>Enterprise</i>), then he doesn&#39;t have the rank of captain and can&#39;t introduce himself as such. So I still disagree. But of course, it&#39;s possible that twenty years of watching <i>Star Trek</i> has muddled my brain and I&#39;ve forgotten something. If so, please direct me to whatever episodes or movie scenes prove me wrong - I want to know.<br><br>Also, it doesn&#39;t have to be a month - you can ask again as soon as you feel ready. Sorry if I made it sound overly formal and difficult; that wasn&#39;t the intention.</p>

            <p>When Scotty is ordered to take control of the prototype USS Excelsior. The Admiral calls the rank Captain of Engineering, though to be honest thats the only time its mentioned. So it might only apply when the main role of running the ship is engineering. <a href="http://memory-alpha.org/wiki/Captain_of_engineering"><a href="http://memory-alpha.org/wiki/Captain_of_engineering">http://memory-alpha.org/wiki/Captain_of_engineering</a></a></p>

            <p>I found a badfic (well, not exactly bad, but so messed up that would be still a nice mission) in which the NCIS team run a summer camp for anime characters... but it disappeared before I could even finish to read it. Quite disappointed, it would have been a good way for Agent Sergio Turbo to get a photo with Jethro Gibbs, Sakura Kinomoto and Nanoha Takamachi simultaneously.<br><br>Not that I am out of work. After fixing the typos in &quot;Don&#39;t Forget The Canon&quot; I&#39;m going to kill an orrible one in which Shaoran first get killed, then when Sakura revives him he gets Author-Wraith infected and rapes her. And all canonical couples involving characters that appear in this badfic get destroyed. Better buy some Bleepka before entering it.</p>

            <p>I had this happen to me mid-mission once, I think the third one I worked on. I already had enough invested in it to want to finish the mission. I had to wing it without actual quotes from the fic-just the major charges.<br><br>After that happened, I started making a temporary copy of the fic in Google Docs before I start writing a mission. That makes it easier to write the mission, because I can flip between them easier without having to navigate all the chapters. When I finish completely, I delete it. I do keep checking the original for updates, deletions, or changes.</p>

            <p>Yeah, something like that happened to me just two days ago. I was looking for a specific badfic (also not bad per se, but horrifically messed up), namely &#39;Once Bitten, Twice Shy&#39;, where the standard personality and behavior of members of the xenomorph race was so badly twisted it would have been hilarious, if didn&#39;t like xenos so much.<br><br>I mean, seriously, can you imagine a runner xenomorph (admittedly of below-average intelligence) chasing its tail like a kyoot lickle puppy, while making funny noises? That&#39;s not only stupid, but also totally unnecessary, given the length of said tail. And it just gets better and better.<br><br>Anyway, the point is, I was going to put this fic up on Unclaimed Badfic, but, just like yours, it&#39;s gone. Can&#39;t find it anywhere on the web.<br><br>If anyone does know where to find, post me, would ya? Thanks.</p>

            <p>I realise I haven&#39;t answered your question correctly. When did I find out Mary-Sues sucked? Hmm. <br><br>I never thought much of it, until I began reading Mary-Sue parodies, which, needless to say, were hilarious. Mary-Sues are not hard creatures to make fun of. That theme eventually led me to the PPC, and OFUM, and since I admired the PPC writers, I soon began to adopt their ways. (Although I still don&#39;t understand why it&#39;s such a godawful sin to post an A/N). </p>

            <p>I was planning out a character for an RPG my friend was going to run.  The short description is that it had obscenely high stats and powerful gear due to the min-maxing I was so fond of, when I realized that it would be obscenely boring to play with this character.  I made the jump to mary-sues fairly quickly after that..  The long version is that in 3.5 ed. D&amp;D, a half-demon mind-flayer vampire sorcerer with a base charisma of 18 can deal 400 points of unsavable damage instantly, then teleport away, also instantly.  My min-maxing days are far behind me, thankfully.  </p>

            <p>My first fanfic was a riveting two-chapter (never completed, of course) tale about inexplicable time travel, people owning deities, failed revelations, one of my ost hated Fandom Stock Plotlines ever, severe canon OOCism (of a character I would later use correctly, no less!) and inexplicable cool names like Neos, Risen, and Raine. I lived with this fine beast for about a year, until - after improving considerably as a writer - I started work on another fic, including that OOC guy I was talking about earlier. Remembering the fic I wrote earlier, I fished it out of the depths of a forum and read through what I had.<br><br>My reaction: &quot;I... stunk.&quot;<br><br>The characters who still had some hope for redemption were used later, but in typical old-character fashion, twisted and warped in various tragic and sadistic ways.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m not sure whether I was a Suethor or not. I think I think I actually went in the other direction as far as bad writing goes (too bland). I found out that Sue&#39;s were bad about 2 years ago from an article at an RPG site. I think I started to write betterly about 1 year or so ago, but by then I already knew not to make Sues.</p>

            <p>I never read fanfic before I came to the PPC.  I had no interest in it and, as such, had no idea that the Sues were out there.  So I only found out that they were bad when I came here and found out that they existed.<br><br>I can&#39;t really look back at my past writing and see how bad I was because the earliest piece of writing I have (because it is the first thing I ever wrote) is only from November of 2009.

            <p>Probably through a combination of things over a few years. I can&#39;t recall one single defining incident.<br><br>Even in high school, I understood pretty well that anything I wrote at the time was going to be sub-par, simply because I lacked experience. I consciously decided not to attempt anything original, at least not seriously, until I&#39;d gotten out of school. Fanfic seemed like the perfect way to practice writing without making a mockery of my own ideas by trying to write them before I felt ready.<br><br>Interestingly, I learned what a Mary Sue is <i>before</i> I learned that it&#39;s a bad thing, though a reviewer asking me very kindly if I thought certain traits (self-insertion with a make-over, particularly) applied to my OC and whether I thought that made her a Mary Sue, to which I replied &quot;Yeah, those things apply, so you could definitely say she&#39;s a Mary Sue!&quot; And I went on with my life.<br><br>Shortly thereafter, I discovered fanfiction.net, but since I tend not to go blindly looking for things to read--rather, I prefer to have a recommendation--I didn&#39;t encounter most of the badfic. If a summary was spelled horribly, I just ignored it.<br><br>Meanwhile, I was involved in several fandom-based role-plays, and that&#39;s a real hub for Sues. Having to <i>interact</i> with them is probably how I really learned to dislike them. The Pern fandom is especially prone to them, and I spent a lot of time in Pern RP guilds.<br><br>And then at some point, I discovered OFUM and through it the PPC, and came to understand that <i>they were in my Tolkien!</i> And THAT was just going too far. I had one LotR RP character at the time, and the PPC made me realize that even though I&#39;d been careful making her, she was still pretty Sueish, and I gave her up. No way was I gonna go around like that anymore.<br><br>That would&#39;ve been in 2003, right around when I graduated high school. So, I guess that was the last nail in the coffin of my Suethorish tendencies.<br><br>Good topic, by the way. Thanks for starting it. {= )<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I know I hadn&#39;t been reading fanfiction yet (that started when I was 15) so I had no idea how bad things could get.  But I did have my own few characters.  Fortunately, I was shy and too unsure to share them with anyone but my best friend.  I was a bad writer, too, and I knew it.<br><br>One night, I was having a sleepover with that friend, and she commented that she was very happy because she&#39;d put one of her characters through a Mary Sue test, and she had passed &quot;with flying colors&quot;.  &quot;A what?&quot; I asked.  So she gave me some explanation, and after breakfast the next morning, we looked up a Mary Sue litmus test.<br><br>That was the beginning of me amusing myself with litmus tests.  I love them.  I wasn&#39;t too upset that my characters were failing the tests (except that I felt like I&#39;d lost to my friend and I didn&#39;t like to lose).  Still, after that, I always put my characters through litmus tests, and then I started posting my stories, so this actually mattered.</p>

            <p>Coincidentally, last night I went to look at my old fic on the Pit, written during high school, and discovered to my horror that the punctuation was...far below my standards, to say the least.  I think reading PPC missions has helped me catch that kind of mistake better, since now I read the actual written words rather than converting them into proper English grammar mentally.  I can understand now why my senior year English teacher liked to write personal notes with bad spelling; you catch mistakes more when you&#39;re thinking about them and recognize them.<br><br>(And yes, I&#39;m going back to fix my errors in my fic.)</p>

            <p>I think I was about twelve or thirteen, when I took a look at the main character of an original story I was working on and realised that she was so powerful and wonderful that I literally couldn&#39;t tell a story about her. Every time I tried to throw an obstacle in the party&#39;s way I would then think &#39;But Becka can deal with that because she can...&#39; Thinking upon it, I realised that no girl her age should speak ten languages and be able to fly and maintain a Spitfire, among other things.<br>Yeah, I have studied LotR Sues up and down the internet. I have written articles about Sues, their identification and classification and how to avoid them. I&#39;m hoping to publish a book. And that version of Becka is <i>still</i> the worst Sue I&#39;ve ever seen.<br>I&#39;ve since toned her down a lot, and still use her, but she still scores the highest whenever I run a selection of my characters through a litmus test.</p>

            <p>...about the time I found the PPC, actually. I was in the midst of trying to write an &quot;original fiction&quot; fantasy novel, in which the main character was a girl rebelling against her unofficially &quot;arranged&quot; marriage, and she got sept up in a bettle between the world&#39;s gods. It was all very involved, blatantly obvious and as Suvian as it could possibly have got, and I look back on it now and cringe.<br><br>I found the PPC back in April 2008, looked at my writing, and went &quot;...what am I doing?

            <p>Came from a fellow author, Tirathon, giving me a whack over the head with a proverbial clue-by-four, about a year or so ago.  The story I was writing was truly a godawful piece of shit, and I rewrote it.  She still doesn&#39;t like the rewrite, but she said it was a vast improvement over the first one (which I still have in a notebook that I intend to burn at some point).  The original version was way too far-fetched:  I had three time-traveling soldiers, and dumped them into Hogan&#39;s Heroes. Too bad the story stunk and had no plot; along with not one, but THREE Mary-Sues (that I had no valid reason to put in there).<br>All I can say is:  Thank God for Tirathon&#39;s extended reviews (and boy are they funny!).<br><br>Honu_Wahine</p>

            <p>I can clearly remember reading and enjoying some pretty nasty Sues. The one I can pin as my first encounter with Sues was posted on an FFVII site called The Nibel Mansion back in the day; it was Meet Cute Sue with a tragic past, natch, who fell in love with Vincent Valentine. I remember enjoying it, but the site was deleted before I got to finish it. I still wonder what happened to that thing.<br><br>It was more of a gradual realization, I guess. Once I realized that there were ten billion X-meets-OC fics out there, and that I wasn&#39;t the only person in the world writing little stories about my favorite canons, I got pickier. It was a winnowing process, I suppose. And somehow I wound up here. :D</p>

            <p>Hello again :)<br><br>I never actually wrote a Suefic, but when I was about eleven I had a character all planned out, right down to her speshul silver jewellery - I still shudder to think of it. At that time I didn&#39;t realise how awful the Sue problem was, but I never wrote her story because I did feel that she might, possibly, have been too good. Looking back, I&#39;m thankful to have realised that much. <br><br>I did write and post some truly horrid fanfics when I was fouteen; they were under a different penname, which has since been deleted along with all the dreadful fics. Mine was a <i>Star Wars/Star Trek</i> crossover fic, twenty chapters long and ridiculously Happy-Ever-After-ish. I posted it and got a few reviews, mostly the fawning type that demand updates but are all written by equally young readers. Of course, I was flattered. It took another few years (and a lot more exposure to fanfic communitues) before I realised just how badly out-of-character I had driven all the main characters. And that my plot was beyond implausible. I erased everything and didn&#39;t write again for years, but when I did, I&#39;d grown up, and the stories were worthwhile. <br><br>How are things over at ACMSES?</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve recently heard of this place, and i&#39;m shocked to hear that it&#39;s supposed to be a comedic group of stories.

            <p>I&#39;ve always thought it was more about writing quality, or at the least finding a balance, really. For example, hS and yourself have written serious stories for the PPC, though still including humour at times, and I don&#39;t see either of you being driven out of the community for it. :P<br><br>As I&#39;ve said to others here, I sort of see it like the Discworld series, especially since Discworld <i>was</i> an influence on TOS; humour is a part of it, but there is the possibility of writing a more serious story for it as long as it doesn&#39;t get too gritty to fit the overall tone of the series. <br><br>The two aren&#39;t mutually exclusive, I don&#39;t think; it&#39;s more than possible to have both without breaking the story as long as you do it well. For example, the recently-finished <i>Crashing Down</i> story was rather serious, but there was humour in there at parts, where it wouldn&#39;t be out of place. Mitigation and all that is more important than adhering exclusively to one or the other, but that&#39;s probably just my opinion. Sorry for going on about it; I wasn&#39;t meaning to be rude, or to go into speech-mode.</p>

            <p>Have a set of polyhedral random number generators.<br><br>To answer your question: yes, this is a comedy.  The original purpose of the PPC was to write humorous stories about badfic.  While I agree that there is &quot;serious potential&quot; that is not the stated purpose of this organization.  Now, we do have some stories that deal with serious subjects, but they do so through humor.  I would direct you to <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Serious_Business">an article</a> on the wiki, especially the five links in the line &quot;...and likes it that way.&quot;<br><br>As for berating people for being too serious, we have never, to my knowledge, berated anyone for being too serious.  We have asked that they not be so serious in their PPC writings.  We have even encouraged them to write serious stories (though not in the PPC continuum) and have even offered to beta those stories and will, in all likelihood, read them if they are posted.<br><br>So, those things aside, if you are looking for a very serious setting in which to write, the PPC may not be the place for you.  However, we still welcome you to stick around and chat on the board.<br><br>-Barid</p>

            <p>Hey, I noticed you had a bit from Timothy Hopkinson&#39;s aliens fanfic on here. If you somehow see this, and you have the full copy, I would really appreciate it if you were to send that to me. <br><br>It seems that this particular work of art has almost completely disappeared from the internet! Its mentioned all over the place, but nobody has the full version. </p>

            <p>There are a few that stand out. First, this one, which I don&#39;t think I was able to quote directly in the mission:<br><blockquote>&quot;I was just looking through the mail, thinking about my girlfriend Quistis(I can use her name because she&#39;s from another world)&quot;<br>--&quot;The Smasher&quot; by Spidey3000</blockquote>
<br>From the same fic, this one is good, too:<br><blockquote>&quot;My brother, Crazy, is saying that he&#39;s going to beat you as bad in real life as he did in the videogame, without my help. Not that that should influence your decision (he also said you were a sissy girl).&quot;</blockquote>
<br>I don&#39;t even know what the author was thinking with this:<br><blockquote>&quot;&#39;Is-is everyone alright?&#39; She asked, throat rasping.<br><br>&#39;Yeah…&#39; Ron answered with a slight moan, &#39;Except I can&#39;t feel my hooves.&#39;<br><br>&#39;Ron, you don’t have hooves.&#39; Harry replied to him, chuckling, or trying to, since it was quite painful. Ginny was heard to giggle throatily at Ron&#39;s exclamation of horror.&quot;<br><br>--&quot;Harry Potter and the Dragonriders of Pern&quot; by Lesalanna</blockquote>
<br>For sheer OOCness, this next one takes the cake. Note the endearment and reluctance to perform a life-saving action because the Sue wouldn&#39;t like it:<br><blockquote>&quot;&#39;Cordelia, can you hear me? Come on sweetling, please open your eyes.&#39; Snape realized that he would have to force feed the potions to her but was afraid of what that might do to her, he knew his niece and he knew that she did not like being force fed.&quot;<br>--&quot;Family Ties&quot; by dancing stars</blockquote>
<br>I&#39;m sure there are others, but that should do for now.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>“Bastard!” I shouted angrily. I regretted saying it when I looked up cause I was looking into the pale white face of a gothic boy with spiky black hair with red streaks in it. He was wearing so much eyeliner that I was going down his face and he was wearing black lipstick. He didn’t have glasses anymore and now he was wearing red contact lenses just like Draco’s and there was no scar on his forhead anymore. He had a manly stubble on his chin. He had a sexy English accent. He looked exactly like Joel Madden. He was so sexy that my body went all hot when I saw him kind of like an erection only I’m a girl so I didn’t get one you sicko.<br><br>“I’m so sorry.” he said in a shy voice.<br><br>“That’s all right. What’s your name?” I questioned.<br><br>“My name’s Harry Potter, although most people call me Vampire these days.” he grumbled.<br><br>“Why?” I exclaimed.<br><br>“Because I love the taste of human blood.” he giggled.<br><br>“Well, I am a vampire.” I confessed.<br><br>“Really?” he whimpered.<br><br>“Yeah.” I roared.<br><br>We sat down to talk for a while. Then Draco came up behind me and told me he had a surprise for me so I went away with him.</p>

            <p>...Pretty much every line in 30 H&#39;s. Though, my personal favorites are the descriptions of Harry&#39;s guitar ...slayer: &quot;Wrought from the silver heart of heaven&#39;s false promise, laced with vessels that pulsed with angel&#39;s menstrual blood, hewn from the horns of Satan&#39;s generals, it laughed as it was set loose, a laugh that only Harry could hear, but no one could share,&quot; and his book: &quot;It wasn&#39;t really a book, because the pages were made of lasers and the words were made of headless women making godless love to dragons made out of motorcycles, but it was still reading.&quot;<br><br>Also, I would love to know what chumpits are, and where I can buy them.<br><br>Also, &quot;&#39;You are the demons.&#39; And then John was a zombie.&quot; deserves special mention.</p>

            <p>I have a liking for the Big Lipped Alligator Moment that is the &#39;Auras uniting&#39; scene in &#39;An Elf&#39;s Love&#39;:<br><br>(Copied from an MST and formatted for your enjoyment)<br><br>Suddenly winds pick up and her aura appeared. It was gold and suddenly changed to bright white. It threw everyone near her away. Aragorn caught Gandalf before he got hurt. Elrond stood, eyes bugged out. Frodo stood; his glued on her. Aragorn tried to get near her, but again, he was thrown away from the wind.<br>Rosa screamed in pain, yet calmed a little when she felt strong and comforting arms enclose around her. She opened his eyes to see Legolas holding her. He somehow was able to get to her.<br>Rosas’ aura encircled both her and Legolas, growing larger. Suddenly, Legolas’ aura materialized. It was a forest green color. It grew and enveloped itself around Rosas’ aura. As this continued, their auras unite. Elrond and Gandalf gasp at the tremendous power they sensed from their combined auras.<br>Rosa began to calm a little, but she felt another wave of pain and the wind picked up. The whole room became even brighter. Everyone veered away so they wouldn’t be blinded. Rosa began thrashing around. Legolas clung onto her tightly. He then began chanting words of comfort in her ear, hoping it’ll calm her. As quickly it came, it was gone. The wind died down. Rosas’ and Legolas’ auras are gone.<br><br>There is no foreshadowing for this phenomenon, as best I can make out, and once it&#39;s over, <i>no-one speaks of it again</i>.</p>

            <p>A Sue is, by definition, er... there are several definitions, all too lengthy to post and deconstruct in the short time I have remaining before work.<br><br>Some characteristics, instead:<br>-Authorial Self Insert<br>-Uncannily Good-looking<br>-More Powerful than really possible<br>-Center of the Plot<br>...etc.<br><br>I&#39;ve seen implausibly entered characters who were altogether unbelievable, but the author actually spent some <i>time</i> on their personality and gave them a few weaknesses, as well as putting together an actual Plot. A Sue is almost always a hallmark of poor writing ability-- someone who can&#39;t write a decent character and has trouble writing a story with good details is... well, the average fangirl. But poor writing ability is not always a hallmark of a Suefic, and sometimes, <i>very</i> rarely, someone pulls it off. I should clarify-- at least 95% of the stories out there are absolutely terrible. <br><br>For example, JulyFlame just started a roleplay where <i>all</i> of the characters are <s>supposed to be</s> Sues/Stus. It&#39;s one of the most fun, intricate, and mind-bendingly thoughtful things I&#39;ve done in a long time. (It&#39;s located <a href="http://marysueacademy.proboards.com/">here</a>, if you were wondering.) Whether or not a &#39;Sue is a terrible character depends <i>entirely</i> on the author. If the author writes Sues/Stus because they have no imagination to write more realistic characters, the story will be terrible. If the author is a good author who writes Sues/Stus for fun, the story might not be absolutely terrible.</p>

            <p>If you define a Mary Sue as a character with special powers and no decernable flaws, she could be in goodfic, because it is not the special powers or the lack of flaws that actually make a fic bad. <br><br>If you define a Mary Sue as a character that causes canon characters to behave unlike themselves and causes the plot to be nonsensical, then a Mary Sue can&#39;t be in goodfic because her very definition negates goodfic.</p>

            <p>It&#39;s all a matter of persaonal definition, I think. In my book, a Mary Sue is a character who steals the show <i>by way of</i> being excessively pretty/powerful/adorable/angsty/et cetera/all of the above. The ridiculous over-the-top-ness of the character is a major part of that definition, but not all of it. If such a character appeared in a story but didn&#39;t steal the show, I wouldn&#39;t be so quick to label it a Sue - it might be, but I&#39;d want to judge each such case individually. <br><br>It&#39;s not a foolproof system - the matchmaker Sues who exist to force canon characters into OOC relationships may well be an exception - but that&#39;s how I go about it. <br><br>So to answer your original question, Charlie, I&#39;d say not - I agree with Aster; if a Mary-Sue-like character were to be in a good story that isn&#39;t deliberately playing on the concept, I wouldn&#39;t call it a Sue - not outright.</p>

            <p>Especially with short stories.<br><br>Any story in which there is only one viewpoint character will typically revolve around that character to at least some degree.

            <p>What I meant was that all the events in the story and the behaviour of the other characters only relate to the main character. As you say - the entire fictional world revolves around one character and there&#39;s never a hint that there&#39;s anything more to it than scenery with which the main character can interact.<br>I definitely agree about viewpoint constraints meaning that a single-POV story will focus on a single character, but I think that there should be some suggestion that there are other things going on, even if we never get to see them. For example (and I know this is hardly an example of a short story) the Harry Potter books were usually very tightly focussed on Harry, but sometimes other people&#39;s stories intersect with his and we get to see that they do have thoughts and feelings separate from him, and things do happen that don&#39;t directly tie into what he&#39;s doing.<br><br>Not sure how much clearer that was...</p>

            <p>Hey:<br>This is probably something I should know, but I couldn&#39;t find it on the Wiki. The fic I&#39;m considering killing if I get Permission is marked as possibly being a Factory Sue. What exactly does that mean in terms of how a mission should pan out? Does it make any difference? Does it mean that she&#39;ll put up more of a fight? Should I not do one of those for my first mission? I&#39;ve picked out some others I can do and may just unclaim this one. I don&#39;t want to either make a fool of myself by suggesting a fic unsuitable for a newbie, or make a total hash of my first mission.<br><br>Crib notes:<br>Should I change fics? If not, does the fact that Raina is a Factory Sue make a difference to the mission?</p>

            <p>It&#39;s been a year of hiatus. I guess in the interim nothing much changed; the &quot;See Sue. Hunt Sue. Kill Sue&quot; ethos remained. I&#39;ve just had a conversation in the Lounge wherein someone asked me, in all honesty and no pisstaking, what the DBS is.<br><br>What&#39;s the DBS? The source of more missions than all of you, save Indemaat, who is a sporking machine unto herself, managed to produce in a year. And for all the DBS was your most prolific department, you never even made it known that such a department existed. <br><br>Sue slaying, that&#39;s all we&#39;ll do, and that&#39;s all we&#39;ll be known for, and that&#39;s all newbies will learn.<br><br>D&#39;you know, I still feel bad that I never read TOS? D&#39;you know why I didn&#39;t? For one it was full of Sues. I know most of you care about that stuff, and fair play to you, but not all of us are masochistic enough to go reading the OC categories on ff.net. I couldn&#39;t give a crap about Sues if I tried. I read slash. Sues don&#39;t really figure at all, ever.<br><br>And the other reason is the punctuation. The grammar. The spelling! It needed a damned beta. I recently came across a wiki page pointing people to Miss Cam when they bitch about not being native speakers. Am I the only person who&#39;s noticed Miss Cam NEEDS A BETA? There are flagrant abuses of syntax left, right and centre. Everywhere there&#39;s someone people hold up as a paragon of good English, and everywhere they need a BETA. We betas are not just here for shits and giggles! And yet no one feels they need our services, once their crappily punctuated and ungrammatical work has achieved the legendary status.<br><br>That&#39;s not enough, alone, to send me packing. But that plus the ethos plus, really, the way no one even noticed when Trojie and I stopped writing for months... And even when we are around, people only remember the DBS halfheartedly, when they&#39;re reminded. ... it. We put a lot of work into it. A lot of work and a lot of thought and a lot of time and a lot of effort. And a year after we stopped writing - and no one here even noticed - people don&#39;t even know what the DBS is.<br><br>... that shit.<br><br>Our missions stand and can be part of your canon, but I&#39;m out.<br><br>So. I&#39;ll be back when the majority of you have grown up, and got lives, and left this place, and been replaced by a new generation of kids. I hope some of you will, in the meantime, read some DBS missions, realise what the DBS is, and enjoy them.<br><br>Later, peeps.<br></p>

            <p>Mainly because when I read this thread yesterday I was too annoyed to reply to it immediately. <br><br>So what if one person doesn&#39;t know what DBS is? Earlier this year a survey was held in which all boarders were asked to tell a little about themselves, such as had they read TOS, how many missions had they written and who is their favourite agent pair. I remember from the results that a good number of people listed Trojie and Pads as their favourite agent pair. I think this is the most popular agent pair, so why be bothered about one person that doesn&#39;t know the acronym? Sounds like entitlement to me.<br><br>The other thing I was annoyed about is summarising all Sue missions as &quot;See Sue, hunt Sue, kill Sue&quot;. I didn&#39;t bring it up when Trojie mentioned it a few months ago, but I was annoyed then too. I&#39;d like to think that my missions are a little bit more than that. That during the hunt readers get a lot of information about the canon, about good writing / plot building, and about a variety of trivia that could be summed up as &#39;doing research&#39;.<br><br>Sure, there is not much personal interacting between my agents, but after 50 missions or so, getting worked up about the other person&#39;s differences would get repetitive too. They&#39;ve grown accustomed to each other.<br><br>Anyway, you don&#39;t read Sues, I don&#39;t read slash. I actually find most slash formulaic. Sues offer something different every time I see one. At least in my main fandom of the A-Team. I think I&#39;ve done 25 Sue missions there, and not two Sues were alike.<br><br>So long, farewell, auf Wiedersehen, goodbye<br>Adieu.<br><br>IndeMaat</p>

            <p>So far, everyone seems to have been very polite and sorry and apologetic about this, but quite frankly, Pads, I disagree. I think you&#39;re being melodramatic and perching precariously on a high horse of double standards. I&#39;ll start by saying right out that I&#39;m probably taking this more personally than the others - I consider you my friend, not just a fellow PPCer - but I&#39;m angry with you. I&#39;ll try to be objective nonetheless, but no promises. <br><br>Firstly, I&#39;m going to echo what the others have said: This is the first I&#39;ve heard of ANYONE around here not knowing what the DBS is. <i>ever</i>. Considering that it&#39;s in the Original Series and mentioned very often in other missions as well as here on the Board, I don&#39;t see how it&#39;s possible for <i>anyone</i> but a very green newbie not to know. I don&#39;t know who asked you that question in the Loungue, but why are you taking that as an indication of what the community as a whole thinks?<br><br>Second, as Neshomeh said, you haven&#39;t made it nearly clear enough that you think change is needed, let alone made specific suggestions. You haven&#39;t even really been around - lurking, maybe, but if you want a change, you need to contribute more than a rant-like post every so often. It&#39;s hard to get things moving around here, and I don&#39;t think it&#39;s fair that you sit back in silence for months on end and then say this. I knew you weren&#39;t exactly thrilled with how things are right now, but I had no idea you were <i>this</i> disgruntled, and we talk off-Board, yet the only person who seemed to have a real idea of your mindset was Trojie. Why did you have to up and leave so suddenly - couldn&#39;t you have made a &quot;change is needed and I&#39;m really tempted to leave&quot; post first? I realise you&#39;ve been unhappy for a while, but this whole post sounds like a knee-jerk reaction to one little incident - which, to be quite frank, is something I can see you doing on impulse and regretting later. <br><br>Next point: I&#39;ve listened to you talk about &#39;more than just killing&#39; and have spent months thinking about how I could remedy that in my own missions at least. Though I haven&#39;t had time to actually write it yet, my next pieces is going to involve Agent Sedri being rebuked for her bloodthirsty tendencies and sent into several non-Sue missions. I regret that my early missions - the first one in particular - were so graphically violent and killing-oriented. If this were any other kind of story I&#39;d take them down and re-write, but the nature of the PPC isn&#39;t too condusive to that (given how easily our characters can become aware of being written themselves). I don&#39;t like slash and probably never will, but I&#39;m more than willing to try sending Agent Sedri into a bad slash mission, and if that doesn&#39;t work, I plan to try crossovers. You don&#39;t object to crossovers, do you? After all, that Department isn&#39;t particularly well-known... Oh, but I&#39;ll bet no one is surprised to hear me mention it. How <i>odd</i>.<br><br>Fine, fine, I&#39;ll stop with the sarcasm. Try this: You have an aversion to Sues. I have an aversion to slash. Where do you get off telling me that <i>I&#39;m</i> in the wrong? I have read slash missions, you know - yours, and others&#39;. I&#39;ve read slash stories as a favour to you and Trojie, though I&#39;ve never liked them. Despite cringing at the bad grammar, I&#39;ve read TOS - several times. I&#39;m sorry, Pads, but I&#39;m seeing a rather blatent double-standard here. <br><br>Also, I&#39;m sorry that gruesome and violent deaths have become too much. It&#39;s true; they have. But let&#39;s not forget that Jay and Acacia inflicted some truly horrible deaths on their targets, and no one seems to be scolding them for that. Why am I feeling attacked here? <br><br>Yes, Miss Cam needs a beta, too. <i>Everyone</i> needs a beta - even I, even you, and you&#39;re the Grammar Nazi <i>Queen</i>. Even so, betas don&#39;t catch everything. Miss Cam&#39;s work is readable, and there&#39;s a dramatic difference between her errors and those of a chatspeak-writing fanbrat who clearly doesn&#39;t care at ALL. I&#39;m not excusing those errors - it&#39;s the responsibility of every writer to get a beta - but you&#39;re being too hard on her, on everyone. If you feel personally insulted for not being consulted... well, too bad. Get over it. I&#39;ll remind you that you <i>don&#39;t have to read it</i>, and you don&#39;t have to like it just because others like it and call it &quot;legendary&quot;; there are some fanfics out there with very bad presentation that I read anyway because the story is so good - I&#39;ve offered to beta and been turned down, but I still read because <i>the story is worthwhile</i>. If it upsets you that the wiki directs people to Miss Cam as a good example, <i>change it</i>. Make a comment in the article or delete the link. No one will object,<br><br>Also, no life?  Why do you think I&#39;m not <i>here</i> half the time? And if seeing the problems in my missions and actively seeking to correct them isn&#39;t considered &#39;grown up&#39;, then what is? Perhaps you didn&#39;t mean me when you said &quot;the majority of you&quot;. You probably didn&#39;t; you probably meant the large number of newbies whom you haven&#39;t even talked to. <br><br>Of course it was noticed when you stopped writing - or don&#39;t you recall that people were asking about your missions, some putting a great deal of effort into trying to find them? Ah, but maybe you weren&#39;t around the Board at the time. Still, how often are particular PPC authors actually sought out like that? I&#39;ll tell you, no one has asked why <i>I</i> stopped writing; I guess my missions just weren&#39;t interesting enough. Oh, well. I&#39;m not fussed. Why are you? I realise you put a lot of work into it - I&#39;ve seen it - but the PPC is still supposed to be FUN, not about getting recognition. If I send my agent to the Department of Crossovers and in six months, a newbie reacts with surprise at the mention of the name, would I have a right to be upset? Probably not. <br><br>Last, even if you have excellent counter-arguments for everything I&#39;ve said here, I don&#39;t see how you storming out like this is going to help matters, unless you think the shock value and making people feel guilty is going to manage it. If you want to leave, fine - I&#39;ll miss you, but it&#39;s your choice. But leaving like <i>this</i>... Maybe you don&#39;t see it as storming out, but I do. Text without tone or body language has a funny way of coming across differently than one might intend.<br><br>I don&#39;t want to be angry at you, Pads. You&#39;re my friend, and despite the acerbity of your post, it seems like you meant it to come across as a fairly even-handed explanation. It just didn&#39;t come across that way to me, likely because, as said, I&#39;m taking this personally, or am just reading too much into this. I don&#39;t know. <br><br><br>...That&#39;s probably everything. At the very least, I&#39;m out of words. I know I&#39;ll probably regret some of this and won&#39;t have made myself clear enough about other bits and will end up explaining myself or taking various things back, but right now, this is what I think.</p>

            <p>You seriously think people don&#39;t think about Bad Slash? Umm... Wow. No, we do. It was probably the second department I was exposed to, and DBS missions were some of the first ones I read. There was a problem with the wiki where it was difficult to get to your missions for a while, though, and I had to track them down--I think that might&#39;ve been part of the problem with people&#39;s lack of knowledge about DBS.<br><br>Notice how old most of the DMS missions are, compared to the more general Floaters missions? When I went through categorizing stuff, I realized the PPC has been moving away from outright Sue-killing for a while, so that at least three-quarters of new missions don&#39;t emphasize killing the Sue and about a third don&#39;t involve killing a Sue at all. Newer missions tend to focus on the odd-coupleness of the agents, the insanity of the fic, and the odd situations they get themselves into.<br><br>Yes, TOS needs a beta compared to what we&#39;re turning out now. But remember that Shakespeare&#39;s plots would be considered cliched and unoriginal today... because he started those ideas. TOS is something you read because it&#39;s what started everything. It&#39;s part of PPC history.</p>

            <p>I, for one, took your message in the &quot;more than just killing stuff&quot; thread to heart.  That is why I teamed up with Neshomeh to spork a crossover.  We did have killing in it, but it was a device used to draw attention to the fact that killing is not always the answer (and it was reversed later on).<br><br>I have been working on a new agent who will eventually end up in Floaters.  I have plans for his first two missions, neither of which will involve killing a sue.

We are working on helping to fix the problem, but it takes time.  I hope that, at least, you will lurk for a while, see that something is being done, and come back before most of us are gone.

            <p>I&#39;ve proposed some ideas for change in the thread above. It would have been nice if someone who wanted to see such change had done this beforehand, though. Projects need leaders.<br><br>I for one was very sorry to see you go on hiatus, Pads, and I was patiently anticipating you and Trojie making a come-back when your lives got sorted out, completely unaware until recently that the PPC itself had anything to do with it. If I haven&#39;t been vocal enough about that, I apologize, but I didn&#39;t know you wanted to hear it.<br><br>I&#39;m glad you&#39;ve said guilt isn&#39;t required, because I can&#39;t accept that responsibility. As far as I&#39;m aware, we&#39;ve only known that you and Trojie wanted to see changes for the last month or two. That&#39;s a rather short period of time for a large group with disparate, constantly-fluctuating membership to completely overhaul its outlook, and I wonder if you&#39;re being entirely fair to have expected it of us without offering specific suggestions for things to change, or offering to help make those changes, or even being around to set an example. Many of the people who joined in the last year had absolutely no reason to know why you stopped writing or to expect that you would start again. But for one thread a while back, you were gone. How could they know? I also feel like you&#39;re ignoring those of us who DO write other types of stories, without killing. Maybe we&#39;re not as prolific as you and Trojie were, but we do exist, despite the lack of anyone talking about it. And remember, not everyone wants to read slash, good or bad.<br><br>I hope you&#39;ll reconsider your decision with the above in mind. However, if retiring is something you really need to do for yourself, then I respect that. Though I&#39;ll be sad to see you go, I won&#39;t beg you to stay. I wish you only well.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Okay, pressed the enter key too soon. <br><br>As an oldbie, I have never though of the PPC as &#39;hunt Sue, kill Sue.&#39; I realize the PPC has sort of gone in that direction, but there are those of us here to try to point out to the newbies that there is more to the PPC. <br><br>I&#39;ve read the missions you and Trojie wrote and noticed when you guys had stopped writing. I didn&#39;t think it necessary to point out though. I mean, wouldn&#39;t it be annoying if twenty or so people asked &quot;OMG Why have you stopped writing?&quot; <br><br>I&#39;m sorry that you feel that most of us don&#39;t have lives and need to grow up. As someone who has been a member of the PPC for six years, I believe that I /do/ have a life and that my view on the PPC doesn&#39;t make me immature. Sure, there have been some new kids that have taken everything way out of context, but applying that to most of us just doesn&#39;t make sense to me.<br><br>Anyways, I&#39;m sorry to see you go and I wish you luck (if you are still checking to see if anyone has replied).<br><br>-Gen</p>

            <p>You and Trojie were the reason I got into the PPC in the first place. I&#39;d noticed when you left. I&#39;d been checking Trojie&#39;s Livejournal every day, hoping to find another mission there. I had been hoping that it was just school problems, or a hard time at work, or something else temporary. Occasionally, if I had forgotten to take my meds that day, I would worry that there had been a traffic accident or something equally scary. I will not beg you not to go, because it would be rather juvenile and I know it wouldn&#39;t work anyway.

            <p>As one of the newbies that is still in the process of licking boots, stuff like this worries me. I&#39;m fairly sure the PPC exists not only because people are passionate about good writing on the internet, but also because it&#39;s... fun.<br><br>It depresses me just as much when someone ragequits a Massively Multiplayer Online game. Isn&#39;t this all being done for fun? Why get so angry about it?<br><br>I&#39;m new, I do want to take down Mary Sues, and I can do it in a diverse way once I am able to get permission and stop licking boots. Or I think I will be able to. Stomping in here yelling that quality is at an all time suck and then putting the responsibility for bringing back quality as it pertains to one group of people on newbies like me... makes me nervous. Am I good enough to do that? I don&#39;t know.<br><br>It reminds me of the balancing struggles that lots of Massively Multiplayer Online games have about classes.<br><br>&#39;My character class is weak and under-balanced and getting ignored. I hate the character class that is getting all of the attention. I am going to ragequit because of it, all the people who don&#39;t do what I do or see eye to eye need to get a life/grow up because MY FACTION IS RIGHT.&#39;<br><br>I don&#39;t know who&#39;s right here.

            <p>All right, let&#39;s start this. Most of you probably don&#39;t see me as the source of this sort initiative, especially as I&#39;m still a newbie at heart, and more than a year on this Board has not changed that (I&#39;ve also done a lot of things that I&#39;m not proud of, but this is not the thread to disscuss that). <br><br>However, I do pay attention to when someone speaks about the PPC state of affairs. I was there when the gradual descent into &#39;Cerebus Syndrome&#39; was seen, and spoken out against. I was also there when the first &#39;PPC: more than just killing stuff&#39; thread was established. I didn&#39;t post in either of them, but I think I got the message.<br><br>Anyway, Pads is right. Anyone with half a brain can see that (although I somtimes wonder if I even <i>have</i> a brain) We&#39;ve been overtaken by the &quot;See Sue. Hunt Sue. Kill Sue&quot; ethos, and most people outside the PPC know us only for that. I&#39;ve only read a few Bad Slash fics (as Slash isn&#39;t my thing) but I&#39;ve always tought that it was an Important part of the PPC, both in-universe and out. <br><br>As I only read a few missions at a time, I always tought that the Bad Slashers, the people from Despatch, and the others in the &#39;no killing departments&#39; were still there, doing their work. I didn&#39;t even notice that Trojie and Paddlebrains were on hiatus, and I tought that they were still doing the work that made the PPC much more than a bunch of Blood Knights.<br><br>Now that one of the people I admired (even though I rarely read her work) is gone, I would like to finally try to start something by myself. I know that I would probably get some things wrong, but there&#39;s no harm in trying, at least in this matter. As this is already a long and rambling post, I&#39;m going to type my proposed solutions to this matter in another one. Please post your replies to it instead of this one.<br></p>

            <p>I think the most interesting missions are the ones that deal with unique problems. Some of these are Sue missions of course, but many are not.<br><br>The main problem with Sue missions seems to be that the only problem the agents are facing is that there&#39;s a Sue in the story, and the only solution used is to kill the Sue. That gets repetitive. (Bad Slash missions that go &quot;Observe, optionally get squicked, exorcise, neuralyze&quot; are similarly formulaic.)<br><br>Whereas, if there are unique complications, it gets more interesting. Bumbling agents, &quot;unique&quot; grammar, mischievous minis, hostile environments, equipment malfunction, personality conflicts... the list goes on. Whether there&#39;s a Sue to kill or not, the mission can&#39;t just be about killing her. We&#39;ve seen that already. A lot. It was new when TOS was written; but it&#39;s not new now, and we can&#39;t just keep copying what&#39;s been done ten times already.</p>

            <p>Let&#39;s not forget the fun factor. I try my best to make sure my missions don&#39;t get repetitive and seek out badfics with more than just the standard problmes, but it still has to be fun. That&#39;s generally what keeps my missions from being about killing the Sue - the fun. I&#39;m not disagreeing with you; I just don&#39;t want to push people too far in the other direction.</p>

            <p>When I think of making a mission funny, it&#39;s usually in terms of the little details - funny remarks, odd manifestations due to bad wording and so on. But I see what you mean, and you&#39;re right; overall, my missions probably aren&#39;t all that funny. I&#39;ll have keep this in mind - cheers :)</p>

            <p>Hey, I&#39;ve been reading PPC missions for a while, and I agree with you.  I tend to enjoy bad slash missions the most myself, though other types can be hilarious in the right circumstances.  Remember the sandwich man?</p>

            <p>...but forgot. Anyway, inauspicious beginning aside, here are the proposed solutions to this dilemma that I promised. Others can probably add more, but for the moment, here are my two cents:<br><br>-First, we should look for more badfics where killing isn&#39;t really necessary. Not just Slash (which squicks me out) but Het, Frienship, Family, Despatch, Crossover, and Platonic Hurt/Comfort (if such insist). We have an entire Multiverse of fics that we&#39;re ignoring just because there&#39;s no one worthy of shooting, chopping, or throwing into a Volcano. <br><br>An example of the sort of fic I was talking about is the Crossover one that was sporked by Barid and Neshomeh. While there was a killing in the mission, it was only to show how <i>wrong</i> an Agent can be sometimes, especially when he is unbalanced. Plus, it was undone eventually.<br><br>-Second, put more emphasis not just in the Department of Bad Slash, but also in the Division of Bad <i>Het</i>, which does exist, though it only has one mission. There will always be those of us that can&#39;t handle slashy subject matter (like me) but that doesn&#39;t mean that going down the path of the Blood Knight who only lives only to kill things. <br><br>If you&#39;d always wanted to exorcise OOC Aragorn who falls in love with equally OOC Eowyn, then just ask if you can do so, instead of passing that fic by to kill the Flourescent Daugther of Elrond and Galadriel. She can wait, there are plenty of others intrested in taking her head as a thropy. <br><br>Okay, I&#39;ve exhausted my brain just to come up with those ideas, but I&#39;m sure that the one I came up with will go a long way towards what I&#39;m trying. I hope that I&#39;ve written my post well, and I give my sincere thanks towards those who read it. Thank you for your time.</p>

            <p>It&#39;s not just Bad Slash and OOCness that needs to be fixed. DOGA, for example, may have to deal with Sues a lot; but there are fics where the geographical aberration is the only actual issue. And what if the writer royally messes up the time scale, so that the canon forces dead characters to live on as canon zombies, and forty-six-year-olds to have forty-eight-year-old sons? Then there&#39;s the DTE and the Technical Errors in many fics: What if the problem isn&#39;t that there&#39;s a Sue, but that the canon&#39;s name has been made possessive without an S so many times that there are now two of him? Or that a consistent misspelling has created a ypur-like beast that&#39;s rampaging across the canon? I mean... wow... there are SO many things you can mess up about a fic without any Sues at all.</p>

            <p>a lot of these ideas &#39;how to do a mission without killing a Sue?&#39; are big ideas, while such missions can easily be found in goodfic. And wouldn&#39;t we all much rather read goodfic than badfic.<br><br>For instance, an author and/or their beta reader might have overlooked a typo, or a Briticism, or plain typing in the wrong character&#39;s name. Examples from my own missions:<br>Mission #8: American character is holding a brollie. Agents go in to give him an umbrella.<br>Mission #11: Agents go into the story to remove a canon character that accidentally ended up in the fic.<br>Mission #14: Agents give cc a manicure because author had given him callus on his hands.<br>Mission #20: Agents talk an original character out of  out of character behaviour. (The fic actually featured a massive Sue, but also spanned 50 chapter and I didn&#39;t want that epic a mission)<br>Mission #22: Agents need to sober up a character who canonically doesn&#39;t drink alcohol.<br>Mission #27: Agents go into story because cc is holding on to a gun the wrong way round.<br>Mission #32: Agents go into story to present a character with the regulations on saluting in doors.<br><br>If anyone cares to read these missions: all can be found on <a href="http://indemaat.livejournal.com/tag/minimission">my lj</a> using the tag &#39;minimission&#39;.<br><br>And not on my lj yet, but most definitely not about killing: <a href="http://members.home.nl/indemaat/04sga.html"> Agents talk character out of killing himself</a><br><br>Cassie, have I met the requirements of your challange or should I write something new?</p>

            <p>If we&#39;re going to make a change, it has to start with what people see when they join up. That means the Wiki and the Links. The latter is easy--maybe we use a link to the Complete List of PPC Fiction, which is by department, rather than the List of Killed Badfic, which is by canon. Maybe we include Bad Slash, DOGA, and any other particularly influential departments specifically as recommended reading.<br><br>The Wiki, however, will take more than the efforts of just one or two people. Personally, I feel this is something someone who wants to see a specific change happen ought to take charge of, as they would know best what should be done and where, but there are a couple of things I can think of:<br><br>1) Let&#39;s put the Complete List of PPC Fiction in true alphabetical order, shall we? The DMS is not at the top of that order. In fact, that&#39;s so bloody easy I&#39;ll go do it as soon as I&#39;m done here.<br><br>2) The FAQs. Particularly the FAQ for Other People, if Araeph doesn&#39;t object; it is particularly heavy on Sue-centricism. Maybe she herself wouldn&#39;t mind re-writing it with other approaches to PPCing in mind, or maybe we&#39;ll do it in a separate thread as a group later on.<br><br>Finally, one thing that no one else has mentioned, but that I feel is very important, is reviewing. Some of you are very good about it, but you are few and far between. I don&#39;t even count myself among you, although I have been trying. How, exactly, do people know their work (DBS, DMS, or otherwise) is appreciated if we don&#39;t review it--with, mind you, the in-depth, constructive kind we all expect to get? Particularly in cases of those who use journals (or the Wiki, as I do), there is really no excuse for not doing this. The option is there; it doesn&#39;t go away just because the plugging thread falls of the Board or you have to go do something else for a while. So don&#39;t forget, and don&#39;t leave it at &quot;Good mission!&quot; or &quot;I liked it!&quot; If compliments can be insulting, that kind are. I, at least, expect more of this community. At minimum, have the courtesy to say WHY you liked it, or WHAT in particular made it good. Got it?<br><br>Okay.<br><br>~Neshomeh + $0.02</p>

            <p>Because <i>man</i> there&#39;s a lot of that. (Someone who&#39;s been shot that many times shouldn&#39;t be walking! Arterial bleeding does not work that way! Wait, what&#39;s Haldir doing in Mordor?) And the ending of that could just be to patch up injuries and send everyone back to where they should be, maybe (but not necessarily) killing really objectionable and canon-breaking OCs.<br>Or would that fall under DAVD?</p>

            <p>Does it matter to the DAVD if the torture is deliberate on the author&#39;s part, or accidental because random gore is being thrown around and/or the author has no concept of what the human (or whatever) body can actually take? It&#39;s still torture, and still disturbing. Like in the chat room the other day, somebody mentioned a fic with a character having sex with a vampire for three weeks straight. Without breaks. Now tell me that isn&#39;t disturbing--it&#39;s a recipe for one gruesomely, horribly dead canon!<br><br>Anyway, yeah, we haven&#39;t had DAVD missions in a while yet. However nausea-inducing they tend to be, there&#39;s just way too much gratuitous torture!fic out there for it not to come to the PPC&#39;s attention.</p>

            <p>I guess it depends on your definition of &quot;disturbing&quot; - or, that of the Intelligence reporter, I suppose. I doubt you&#39;ll have anyone telling you that a fic doesn&#39;t qualify unless it&#39;s full of fluffy unicorns - and a case can be made for that, too. *shudder*</p>

            <p>I think that this would probably be DAVD territory, yes. The original DAVD dealt with torture/murder fics generally, but this kind of fic sounds right up their alley--you know, where the injuries are simply extreme and gory, or else minimized to the point that you&#39;ve got canons who should be dead but are being forced to walk around and act pretty much normal.<br><br>My suggestion: Transfer an agent from Medical and have them go on field missions with the goal of keeping the canons alive. Think of them as something like the PPC&#39;s version of a paramedic. I can definitely see them carrying bleepphene injectors for the more painful cases.</p>

            <p>It&#39;s tough to really find a fic that fits the bill and isn&#39;t a Legendary, but that is an interesting approach. We&#39;ve been sort of treating the one we&#39;re working on now as an escort mission, getting the canons through the chapters without being horribly murdered. Progress has been slow because we&#39;ve both been busy, especially Spud, but we&#39;re still chipping at it.</p>

            <p>Could you provide suggestions of some suitable badfics for this type of mission?

            <p>since I&#39;ve read the books or watched the movies, and I&#39;ve never read anything beyond The Hobbit and LoTR.

            <p>For the most part, just LotR and the Hobbit would probably do the trick for these ones, though obviously more canon is more better and any time reading Tolkien is time well spent in my opinion, so I&#39;m biased. :P<br><br>Yeah, I went looking for suitable Discworld fics and found one involving Vetinari and some werewolves, but for the most part it was just... rather strange.</p>

            <p>That&#39;s certainly true for Sues and much of the Bad Slash I have glancingly encountered, and Aragorn and Legolas are common victims of bad action, but there&#39;s also a lot of attention shown to book-only characters such as Glorfindel, Erestor and the twins. Still, I think a basic knowledge of who they are would work, since much of the time the stories don&#39;t follow the main plot.</p>

Hell, they <i>created</i> the very foundations of several - Lux and Sean, our beloved Bad Slashers; The Marquis de Sod, our refreshingly sadistic Head of Personnel; Medical, our everlasting prop when someone&#39;s pratfallen; and of course, they spent time in the Department of Implausible Crossovers, with the Lichen that sounds like John Cleese.<br><br>And no, I know they didn&#39;t have a beta-reader. Neither did Miss Cam, and I will not pretend that their stories were perfect. The content was excellent, but as Pads said, HELL they could have used a lot of grammar work. Incidentally, that&#39;s something else I&#39;ve noticed is slipping a fair bit lately.<br><br><br>Slightly overdone dramatics over, I&#39;m laying down a challenge to the entire PPC. Submit at least <i><b>one non-Sue-slaying mission or other PPC writing</b></i> by Hallowe&#39;en. Normally I&#39;d have said the end of September, but given it&#39;s back-to-school time and generally end-of-the-summer stuff for a massive number of people, I&#39;m giving this a two-month deadline.<br><br>If you have Agents in <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/List_of_Departments">Departments other than the DMS</a>, fantastic. If not, have Intel &quot;accidentally&quot; send them the wrong mission, or have the Marquis assign one as punishment for some minor misdemeanour. Find a crossover or a bad slashfic or anything at all, or write a non-mission piece - an interlude, perhaps. There are more than just the Action Departments, too; look at our huge range of Infrastructure Departments and the work that goes on behind the scenes. A &quot;Day in the Life&quot;, perhaps? Anything you like, as long as it is <i>not focused on a Sue</i>.<br><br>And before you post it to the public, GET IT BETA-READ. Get it gamma- and delta-read, if necessary. This <i>does not mean</i> showing it to someone, asking them to comment, and then posting it as-is. It means getting someone (preferably somebody with a good knowledge of English and/or the fandom) to read it thoroughly, and mark or point out any mistakes, inconsistencies, typos or just plain great whacking goofs. Then you fix the errors, ask your beta to check it again just to make sure, and once they&#39;re satisfied, THEN you post.<br><br>The PPC has a little pool of excellent beta-readers (one less, sadly, with Pads&#39;s departure), and I&#39;m offering my services as a beta to anyone who takes up the challenge and sends me their piece in good time. I may have trouble with fandoms I don&#39;t know, but I&#39;ll be as on-the-ball as possible with spelling and grammar etc. issues.<br><br>So come on, people! Don&#39;t let the Sues take over the PPC to the point they make us forget the rest of the fandom blunders that are out there. Bring back our diversity!</p>

            <p>I&#39;m gone, really, but talking to Sedri, and noting that those who suggest change should be definitive, I&#39;d like to add a rider.<br><br>Write a non-Sue <b>featuring your usual agents</b>. Having to get to grips with a new pair of agents makes it difficult - half the reason TOS works is you knew the agents, knew their characters, and cared about them. I&#39;m fairly sure half the reason most of you like our Bad Slash missions is they&#39;re a bit of a soap opera, and that&#39;s no bad thing. Put your usual slaying agents into a non-Sue, and see how they react. It&#39;ll be a lot more interesting than new and unknown agents.</p>

            <p>I know I&#39;m still rather new, but I want to share how I have been feeling lately. The last several times that I have posted a story, I have considered myself extremely lucky to get two responses. It has been really discouraging, honestly. I have four stories that I still haven&#39;t posted, and I&#39;ve been rather reluctant to post them. I&#39;d rather have people ripping them to shreds, (so I can at least improve) than having them totally ignored. Whether it is true or not, I get to thinking that the reason they get no comments is that they don&#39;t meet PPC standards and no one wants to say so.<br><br>I have nine completed stories for Kelok and Unger, which number two interludes and seven missions. Six of those seven missions are bad slash. There are bad slash missions being written. I don&#39;t think I am the only one with a recent bad slash mission.<br><br>I have posted general board requests for Betas. I do very much appreciate the anonymous content comments I received, but I am sure that I had more than a couple of grammar errors, since grammar is my greatest challenge. <br><br>Please consider this as a second request for a serious grammar Beta. I know I need one.<br><br>Anyway, the probable whining is over, now. You can all go back to regularly scheduled programming.<br><br></p>

            <p>First of all, I understand exactly what you mean about responses, and I&#39;ve also mentioned more and better reviews as something we can all improve on around here (with a few exceptions, such as you, who already give good reviews to just about everyone, which makes you awesome). See &quot;More Ideas&quot; above.<br><br>As for the beta-reading, my memory is that your last request was for four missions, and that freaked me out. I didn&#39;t want to volunteer for that many at once, especially on Google Docs, because I know I would feel overwhelmed and never get through them. I am notoriously slow even doing just one. That said, I will offer to take one of them, but I ask that you e-mail it to me as a .DOC file. Google Docs is great for collaboration, but I really don&#39;t like it much for editing.<br><br>And finally, you&#39;re not whining. Certain other parties dropped the ball when they forgot other people write Bad Slash missions, too, and I&#39;d say you&#39;re justified in being upset at that.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I already have a non-killing Bad Slash exorcism mission in progress, but it&#39;s a Nine Inch Nails songfic which mutilates the song it uses, and my only pair of exorcists have both been established as knowing very little about and/or actively hating Nine Inch Nails. So, if anyone&#39;s got any Harry Potter Bad Slashers who would be able to point out the horrific mangling of NIN lyrics, I&#39;d appreciate being able to borrow them. Pads was actually helping me with it ages ago, but she dropped out even before she stopped coming on the board and I haven&#39;t touched it since. I&#39;ll blow the dust off it for the challenge.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m already writing a mission that involves the termination of an Author-Wraith before the infected canon rapes what was supposed to be his girlfriend (And isn&#39;t in the badfic, that smashes all the canon pairings). Still counts as &quot;Sue killing&quot;?</p>

            <p>If it&#39;s not 100% OOC, it&#39;s still a canon and hasn&#39;t been replaced, which usually means possession, which means exorcism and subsequent beaning the &#39;wraith over the head with a copy of the canon.</p>

            <p>So, it will count for the challenge. Good.<br><br>Even better since I was already doing it before this challenge ever existed.<br><br>Syaoran here has a verbal fight with Sakura (that in the badfic was dating Yue since Syaoran had to get back to Hong Kong), and then goes mad at her and... welll, you all understood. Bonus points because Sakura used the Hope card a few hours before that to bring him back to life since he was killed. It&#39;s only the tip of the iceberg. For example, the author involuntarily made it a crossover with CSI, since there was &quot;csi and police&quot; where Syaoran got killed. I don&#39;t know how crime scene investigation units are called in Hong Kong, but they&#39;re absolutely not CSI. (For example, here in Italy the name is RIS. And we too have a TV show about it.)<br><br>The badfic is NSFW and quite NSFB, but the mission will be funny, I promise. And since the badfic is quite short, it will also feature a bit of my agent&#39;s non-mission life.</p>

            <p>if I&#39;m going to actually become an active PPCer, as in seeking Permission, but if I do I promise my initial mission will not involve Sue Slaying. In fact the one character I have in mind as a potential agent would flat out refuse to go on an assassination mission.<br><br>I think having at least one active agent who refuses to kill, or even go on killing missions, would go a long way in showing that the PPC is not just about the slaying of sues.<br><br>He&#39;s a Healer, possibly a bit on the overpowered side, that keeps wanting to be inserted into my stories. I thought sending him on some PPC missions would help take him down a peg or two :D<br><br>On that thought I think I&#39;ll check when I posted my introduction and see if it&#39;s been a month or not yet.</p>

            <p>That badfic was thoroughly horrible. I don&#39;t know much of anything about the Sweeney Todd verse, but I&#39;m glad you killed this. What is it with badfic authors and thinking it is a good idea to write about people sticking fingers into open wounds? This is definitely not the first time that I have seen that. Although, I guess I should just be glad that he didn&#39;t enjoy it--I&#39;ve seen torture fics where the victim decides that feels pretty nice. In fact that puts in me mind of a fic I read before hearing of the PPC that I should go find, so I can kill it.<br><br>Anyway, I enjoyed your mission. When I first saw the line about &#39;beer, beer, beer, beer...&#39; my first thought was that it was going to be a reference to an Irish drinking song titled <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgXx6rd56jM">&#39;Beer, beer, beer&#39; </a>.<br><br>I have to admit that I took an example from the agents and tried to pretend that I didn&#39;t know what was going on, on this one. I did really enjoy their interactions, though. Having had a kid trying to learn the violin, I loved Stormsong&#39;s comment about it not sounding like it is coming from a rusty hinge now.<br><br></p>

I think that might really help readability for some of the lesser-known fandoms.

            <p>I&#39;ve already volunteered to do one of Miah&#39;s missions, but when I get that done, anyone else can ask. My information is now on my Wiki <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/User:Neshomeh">user page</a>, but I&#39;ll copy it here:<br><br>Neshomeh is willing to beta-read any type of mission in any of the continua listed in her infobox<a href="08c%3Fuser_id=16.html#fandoms">*</a>, and then some. If you&#39;re not sure if she knows something, just ask.<br><br>Should you wish to request her services, there are a few things she would like you to know ahead of time. First, make sure your story is in a .DOC file, because she prefers to use Microsoft Word&#39;s &quot;Track Changes&quot; feature to edit. It shows very clearly what changes she has made and allows her to leave comments and suggestions in the margins. Google Documents just doesn&#39;t match it.<br><br>Second, she takes time to read, absorb, re-read, correct, and double-check any story before sending it back, so if you&#39;re in a hurry, she&#39;s probably not the one you want. Expect the average mission to take at least a week to get back to you; more if it&#39;s longer or particularly in need of help. And then she&#39;ll want to check the re-write, too.<br><br>Finally, and perhaps most important, Neshomeh does not ask rhetorical questions when beta-reading. If she leaves a question in the margins, it means that something didn&#39;t make sense and needs to be addressed in the re-write. She has found that people often do not understand this without being told.<br><br>-----<br><br><a></a>My preferred fandoms are these:<br><br>*Animorphs<br>*Babylon 5<br>*Battlestar Galactica (2003)<br>*Discworld<br>*Dragonriders of Pern<br>*Farscape<br>*Firefly/Serenity<br>*Fullmetal Alchemist<br>*Harry Potter<br>*House, M.D.<br>*Jekyll &amp; Hyde (book and musical)<br>*Lord of the Rings<br>*Phantom of the Opera (Leroux, Kay, and Webber)<br>*Young Wizards<br><br>But really, if I&#39;ve heard of it and don&#39;t hate it, I&#39;ll give it a shot. If I don&#39;t know a fandom, that makes it easier to point out what might need more of an explanation. {= )<br><br>... By the way, don&#39;t mind the yellow highlighting you may see in the lower part of this post. It&#39;s because of the &lt;a name=&quot;fandoms&quot;/&gt; HTML tag I used to make the asterisk from above link to it. I have not broken the Board, or your internet. {= ) <br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>With so many people taking up Cassie&#39;s challenge at once, logistics are likely to become a nightmare around here. I have a few ideas to help smooth this out:<br><br>1) Please make sure to update the Claimed Badfic page and check to make sure that no one else has found the same badfic for their non-Sue mission; with everyone going out to search at once, we&#39;re likely to come across the same things. First come, first served.<br><br>2) Please make headings in Board posts more informative, particularly when relating to missions, particularly in terms of fandom. When there are ten posts in a row entitled &quot;New mission!&quot; &quot;Plug!&quot; &quot;Post!&quot; &quot;Done!&quot; and so on, things get confusing. If there are no objections, I&#39;d like to make it standard policy for all such threads to have headings like so: <br>* <i>New mission! Bad Het, Harry Potter fandom</i><br>* <i>Badfic report! Star Wars, Lord of the Rings, and Aladdin; ratings from G to PG-13</i><br>* <i>Beta reader needed! Pirates of the Caribbean mission, 6,000 words, Department of Bad Slash</i><br>And so on. It will save everyone a lot of time if we don&#39;t open threads for fandoms we don&#39;t know a thing about.</p>

            <p>It seems to me that one of the most un-dealt-with problems around here is the issue of fandoms. With the possible exception of <i>Lord of the Rings</i>, I doubt there&#39;s a single fandom that everyone here knows. In a thread below, Miah pointed out that it&#39;s disheartening to get very few reviews for a mission, and she&#39;s right - I often can&#39;t read a mission because I just don&#39;t know the fandom, and I feel bad for it, but I know I wouldn&#39;t be able to understand, let alone provide useful feedback. It also makes things difficult in terms of overall PPC organisation, the wiki, and badfic discussions.<br><br>Short of everyone here trying to become familiar with every fandom in the world - which isn&#39;t even possible and beyond the scope of a practical solution - does anyone have any idea how we could make this easier to deal with? My above post about labelling plug threads will help, but that&#39;s all I can come up with. I&#39;m not even really sure what the problem <i>is</i>, or if we can call it a &quot;problem&quot; rather than &quot;an unfortunate fact&quot;. </p>

            <p>I know I will occasionally read a mission in a fandom I don&#39;t know, but if it&#39;s too hard to tell what&#39;s going on I&#39;ll usually backspace. Maybe if we try to include very basic information about said fandom&#39;s setting and characters so as to make it easier for readers who don&#39;t necessarily know why it&#39;s so bad that X happened?</p>

            <p>I always try to do that anyway, unless it&#39;s Harry Potter or something I can reasonably expect everyone to at least have heard of. It&#39;s helpful if one of the agents on the mission isn&#39;t familiar with the continuum--or is just really fond of ranting about errors.<br><br>Another thing is the Wiki. In a perfect world, the articles about various continua should give an outline of basic things one should know about the world and its characters, which should help people who haven&#39;t read it understand at least enough to be going on with. Of course, that requires people who know those continua to update the Wiki articles with helpful details.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Hi there~<br><br>I&#39;ve been following Laburnum&#39;s LiveJournal (and her PPC missions) for ... yikes, years now. Earlier today I was bored, over-tired, and impulsive - and Laburnum posted a new PPC mission. So I gave into temptation, wandered over to the PPC site and boards, read some rules and stories, and signed up.<br><br>I&#39;ll be going by Grackle here, I think. In the Redwall community, I usually go by Snowspine (Laburnum stole-with-permission/rescued a couple characters of mine from a story I wrote ages ago, Vengeance Quest). I&#39;m Makhsihed on LiveJournal. <br><br>It&#39;s been ages since I wrote or read fanfiction, but I rather miss it, and have gotten into a few new fandoms since I last read fanfic. Fandoms primarily include Doctor Who/Torchwood (that&#39;s the biggest one for me right now), Redwall, Song of Ice and Fire, and the Kushiel novels. I&#39;m a more casual fan of quite a few other areas (Valdemar, Narnia, Tortall, FarScape, Whedonverse...). <br><br>I&#39;m pretty busy with work (I deal with unstable teenage girls who are in residential treatment), so I don&#39;t know *quite* how much time I&#39;ll have to participate. But I figure writing about eradicating stupidity is stress-relieving and cathartic, so it can&#39;t hurt. <br><br>Anything else? Is that about what&#39;s expected for an introduction? Questions, complaints? </p>

            <p>I shall name her... Miw! Because I am unoriginal and stuff. (It is Middle Egyptian for &quot;cat&quot;.)<br><br>Well, I only recently (in the past several months - I guess that means for some definitions of &quot;recently&quot;) started watching Doctor Who. My roommates are <i>obsessed</i> and own every Doctor Who episode available ever. (Even reconstructed-from-single-slides versions of One.) I started with new!Who, and all I have left are the last two episodes of new!season 5. Then I will probably finish watching Torchwood (am only on the second season of that), and then go back and start watching old!Who. <br><br>Eccleston is my first Doctor, and still my favorite so far.

            <p>I began a long non-fiction book, but never finished it. It would have been similar to what you described. The only advice I can give - besides &quot;stay interested&quot; - is to have a very clearly-defined outline ready before you begin, and to have someone utterly unfamiliar with the subject matter read it when you&#39;re done, so as to catch any and all bits that need clarification.</p>

            <p>More than a year ago, we had a discussion about the possibility of creating a Division of the DMS, to be called the Division of Villainous/Evil!Sues. I promise I&#39;m writing some things. But in the meantime, agents of the DoV/E!S (O U C WUT I DID THAR) would need to be distinguished from agents of the DMS proper in some way. I propose this. What do you all think?<br>Also, one of the points raised in that old thread was that only a small percentage of Sues are villainous. With that in mind, could the DVS also handle Sues who are not themselves evil, but who go after villains and reform them through the power of Twu Wuv? </p>

            <p>Hello, everyone.<br><br>I was browsing TV Tropes about two weeks ago and came across the page detailing the PPC. I&#39;m sort of kind of sure that I read about you guys a year or so ago, but obviously I never got around to anything but lurking. After spending hours on an archive binge, I decided to just go for it. So here I am, for better or worse.<br><br>I haven&#39;t written fanfiction for a while (though I have been writing original prose here and there), but I keep up with my fandoms in the place you all so lovingly call The Pit. The aforementioned fandoms mostly number JRPGs (i.e. Tales of Symphonia and its sequel, Golden Sun and its sequel, Baten Kaitos and it&#39;s sequel [What&#39;s with me and duologies?], Final Fantasy IV, Legend of Legaia). As for other fandoms, I&#39;m an avid fan of the Tortall books (written by Tamora Pierce) and Discworld novels (!!!!!). And I never read LotR, though I did manage to read PPC&#39;s Original Series despite my lack of knowledge. Just getting that out there. Convince me to do so at your leisure. XD;<br><br>I plan on joining the PPC proper when I can. Looking forward to when I do, and keeping an eye out for badfics in my fandoms. I have newfound respect for all agents just because of that. @_@<br><br>So, uh, is there anything else I should say? </p>

            <p>Just to pass the time while we&#39;re bunkering down here...<br><br>I&#39;ve always thought of the Board as a sort of a small city, or perhaps a neighborhood or district of a larger city. The city is, in this case, the Internet. Or perhaps WebApps is the city, and the Internet is the country. Though since it&#39;s the World Wide Web technically the Internet should be the world, but that&#39;s mixing metaphors so badly that I&#39;m not even going to go there. At least, not further than I have already gone. <br><br>In any case, here&#39;s the scenario - the city that is the Board is under attack. Secretly, the Boarders are being evacuated to <i>here</i>. Now, the question is, what would happen? Who would help the others find their way in the new city, who would merely wait to be helped, who would go ax-crazy on the other Boarders at the mere mention of relocation, and who would randomly start painting everything purple and begin quacking like a duck? I don&#39;t know, but I&#39;d like to find out.<br><br>Rules of engagement: You&#39;re still a Boarder. Not one of your Agents, a Boarder. This may sound...control-freakish, but if we were Agents then that would make this an Emergency, and that&#39;s been banned under no uncertain terms. You use your and other people&#39;s Board usernames, and you act naturally for the situation.<br><br>Other than that, it&#39;s just a basic RP with the above them of relocation into a new city. This may be the greatest idea ever, this may be a terrible idea, this may be ignored due to the masses of people saying OMG WHERE ARE WE above it. Lets just see. I&#39;ll start, if nobody minds.</p>

            <p>Edward staggered into the bunker and slumped against the wall, breathing heavily. The bunker itself was breathtaking - it was on a similar scale to the Mines of Moria, albeit with a very low ceiling - but Edward was in no mood to be awed. <br><br>He poked his right side, and winced. The Spamtroll had only scored a glancing blow before the Nameless Admin had blasted it to smithereens, and it had been bandaged up, but it still hurt like bejeezus. <br><br>He looked around. A couple of the older Boarders were chatting quietly with eachother in the center of the room, but other than that, there was nothing but the enormous cement pillars that dotted the bunker. <br><br>That was a problem. <br><br>He dropped his pack and staggered to his feet. People needed to know what was going on, and it seemed like nobody else was going to tell them. Ignoring the other Boarders, he walked back out of the relative peace of the Message Board into the pure havoc that was the Posting Board. </p>

            <p>Pretzel looked up from her computer, glad that she&#39;d thought to bring several extra batteries with her, just in case. <br><br>&#39;We&#39;re in the Board Bunker.

Once she&#39;d managed to get in, she looked around, idly brushing some of her hair, which, while normally frizzy, seemed even more out of control thanks to the battle.<br><br>&#39;Fu Manchu and his silly beard, that was annoying,&#39; she growled, holstering her Pans and resettling her pack on her back. She&#39;d been in the middle of watching a &quot;Let&#39;s Play&quot; of &quot;King&#39;s Quest V&quot; when the news had arrived in her inbox, and so she&#39;d gathered up her laptop and a few other assorted items, shoved it into a backpack, and headed towards the bunker. <br><br>The trolls and various ypurs had tried to slow her down, but she&#39;d found that indiscriminate whacking with her pans seemed to deter the attacks quite handily. Now that she was in a place of safety, she wasn&#39;t quite sure what to do with herself. There seemed to be a fair number of Boarders here already, but Pretzel wasn&#39;t sure if she she go over and talk to them or what. Figuring that eventually she&#39;d think of something (if nothing else, maybe to mooch some of that soup off of Miah), Pretzel sat down at the base of a nearby column and began watching her &quot;Let&#39;s Play&quot; once more, idly picking the bits of troll off of her clothing.</p>

            <p>Galenfea had mostly been trying to lay low during the troll attacks, avoiding getting involved and trying to concentrate on other things, but when she heard Edward&#39;s announcement of the evacuation she hurriedly packed up her laptop, all the Tolkien books she could carry and a few other personal items (including, reluctantly, her homework) and followed his directions to the bunker.<br><br>When she arrived, she stopped almost in the doorway to look around. There were a few people here already, setting up camp with the assurance of practice. Evidently they were experienced boarders and had been through an evacuation before. Galenfea stepped out of the way of someone coming in behind her and wove among the columns, looking for somewhere to settle down. Perhaps when she&#39;d staked out a corner to call her own, she might go and talk to some of the others and find out what she might do to be useful, a true member of this community. She knew a few boarders had been injured - Edward had taken a blow to the side, for one - and maybe her first aid training would be of help. Somewhere like this must have a first aid kit, and at the moment she wasn&#39;t sure what else she could do.<br><br>She set down her backpack in an unoccupied niche and tossed her jacket over it, then began trying to find her way towards the sound of voices.</p>

            <p>I was evacuated in Real Life, so to speak. I could <i>not</i> make this up. Freakishly, my little story about Elemarth&#39;s reaction to the evac could have been a version of what just happened.<br><br>I wasn&#39;t in the least surprised that a fire alarm interrupted my homework/RPGing; we&#39;d known that we&#39;d have a fire drill about this time sometime this week, and a couple of my roommates were actually waiting to get it over with before they dared to have their showers. So, like I did at the board but for good reason, I plugged my ears against the alarm and didn&#39;t take it very seriously at first (though I did leave).<br><br>Then, as we passed the staircase, we heard people shouting to hurry up. The air from upstairs was <b>SMOKY</b>. Need I say that I freaked out? Just like my boarder self, I had brought nothing with me, and my life is in that room, specifically on my laptop. I think I&#39;d die if I lost my laptop. But I couldn&#39;t go back to get it.<br><br>We camped out in the complex common room. Like my boarder self, I had nothing (except a fully charged i-pod), but unfortunately, there were no bots to blow up. :-( And I would have liked to get back at whoever&#39;s bad cooking was responsible for wasting two and a half hours of my time. We had to wait for the smoke and fire extinguisher chemicals to get out. I didn&#39;t hear of any serious damage.<br><br>Truth is stranger than fiction. I could almost not believe the coincidence. (I only did believe it because I&#39;ve had a bigger fire alarm coincidence, which I have been thinking about lately, but that&#39;s a story for another day ;) I should be back to the RPG sometime tomorrow afternoon.</p>

            <p>Galenfea had finally found a first aid kit and made her way back to the growing crowd. It looked like she&#39;d got off extremely lightly. Perhaps she&#39;d found a safe route. In that case, surely it would be her duty to go back and help others?<br>First things first, though. She went over to Sergio, who was leaning on a pillar, one hand to a bloodstained sleeve.<br>&quot;What the hell is happening? There are bots everywhere. I had the time to pack only a few things, they nearly got me.&quot;<br>&quot;I&#39;m not sure,&quot; Galenfea replied. &quot;I just got the message we were evacuating and came straight away.&quot; She pointed to the cut. &quot;Did they do that? Do you want me to have a look at it?&quot;</p>

            <p>...and saw that the smattering of refugees inside the shelter had grown exponentially. Many were keeping to themselves, setting up tarps, blankets, and futons, or quietly entertaining themselves if they had already done so, but a lot of them were still wandering about, confused. To make matters worse, what older Boarders Edward could see were quietly chatting among themselves, paying no mind to the hushed chaos around them. <br><br>Edward limped through the crowd, looking for something to stand on. His left knee had been broken and set poorly when he was about 5, and being thrown to the pavement by a troll hadn&#39;t helped it one bit. He finally found an empty soapbox almost directly in the middle of the crowd, probably the work of the Ironic Overpower. He kicked it a bit to the left, felt pain shoot through his leg and his side, and decided it was good where it was. He stood on it and whistled for attention.<br><br>It wasn&#39;t very noisy, and everyone&#39;s attention turned to him immediatly. He paused a second, coughed, and winced in pain from the movement. Finally regaining his composure, he began adressing the crowd. &quot;First order of business. Does anybody have something I can use as a crutch?&quot; An AK-47 flew out of the crowd, and he caught it awkwardly. He disconnected the ammo, put it in his pocket, and leaned on the gun. &quot;Thank you, I guess. Second, everyone get out of the way of the door. A whole bunch of Ypurs are going to be coming through that door, and if you don&#39;t all move right now someone&#39;s going to get trampled. Okay, good... good... that&#39;s fine. Does anybody have any chalk?&quot; A pack of chalk followed the AK. &quot;Alright, very good. I need...six volunteers to take some of the chalk and draw, let&#39;s say, a four-by four grid of streets on the floor like a city block, centered on this box. They have to be at least big enough for two Ypurs to walk side-by-side.&quot; Boarders scrambled forward for the chalk, and began ordering others around.</p>

            <p>SttQ decided no piece of chalk was worth this. She picked herself up and worked her way out of the small-scale melee that had broken out near the soapbox. She headed over for one of the pillars and sat down against it. Digging in her bag, she discovered her copy of &#39;Moby Dick&#39; and opened it at the bookmark.

            <p>as she heard a newcomer ask for an ice pack. Fortunately, she&#39;d just finished bandaging Sergio&#39;s arm and she hastily scrabbled in the first aid kit again. She was sure she&#39;d seen an ice pack in here.<br>&quot;Just a moment,&quot; she said. The other boarder looked distinctly wobbly on her feet. &quot;Why don&#39;t you sit down? Can someone give her a hand?&quot;<br>Ah, here was an ice pack. She broke the inner seal and gave it a shake, then handed it over. She really hoped that an ice pack and a rest were all PitViper needed - Galenfea&#39;s last first aid class now seemed a very long time ago.<br>&quot;Does he mean that we&#39;re going to get invaded even here?&quot; she asked another nearby refugee, trying and failing to keep the nervousness out of her voice. She couldn&#39;t expect her luck to hold for another invasion, and she wasn&#39;t much of a fighter.</p>

            <p>Her pounding headache receded when she held it against her bruised forehead. Taking the thermos of gazpacho from SttQ, she held that against her sore ankle.<br><br>&quot;Thanks,&quot; she murmured. The fog in her head cleared. &quot;This happened about a year ago,&quot; she went on. &quot;I was really new back then, so I was freaking out, but the trolls and spambots never got this far. We should be safe here, and as soon as the Nameless Admin and the rest of &#39;em finish clearing them out, we&#39;ll be able to go back.&quot; She winced slightly as she shifted the icepack against her head. &quot;Of course, last year I wasn&#39;t dumb enough to run smack into a spambot. I hope they don&#39;t make this an annual thing. That would piss me off so much.&quot;</p>

Don&#39;t set up on the roads that are being marked out, and try to take up as little space as possible. When the Ypurs come, they&#39;ll be bringing medical supplies, but no medical personal. If you&#39;ve set up your stuff and have any first-aid experience, go to the far end of the chalk road on my right and start setting up...whatever you need to set up. If you have a gun and can use it, bring it and come here. I don&#39;t mean you know how a gun works, I mean you&#39;ve used one before, maybe even had some training. If you know how to use one but don&#39;t have one, come here anyway. If for whatever reason, you have one but don&#39;t know how to use it, give it to us to use. Mark it somehow so that we can give it back to you after this thing blows over.&quot;<br><br>&quot;If you&#39;ve finished setting up, can&#39;t do first aid, and can&#39;t shoot, help someone else. If there&#39;s nobody else to help, which I doubt, I saw some folding tables laying around. Set them up on the far end of the chalk road to my left, like a buffet line. When we get supplies, I want them to be handed out orderly!&quot; <br><br>He stepped off the soapbox and sat on it, aknowledging the growing, but still worryingly small, pile of munitions at his feet and the similarly sized group of people.

            <p>... at the news that she was not the only first aider here. She didn&#39;t have much in the way of supplies, though - the contents of the kit she&#39;d found (she was in the process of discovering that it was one of those with fifty tubes of sugar gel, a giant dressing or two and no plasters) and a couple of plasters in her pocket. She wished she&#39;d brought the big first aid kit from home - if PitViper was right and this happened fairly frequently, she&#39;d have to have a survival kit ready by the door so she could just make a run for it at a moment&#39;s notice.<br>Still, she picked up the kit and headed down to the end of the chalk road as Edward had indicated. There were a small collection of fellow first aiders setting up and she waved a little shyly.<br>&quot;Hi,&quot; she said. &quot;I&#39;m a first aider. What can I be doing?&quot;</p>

            <p>Data had been preparing for this moment for years now. Training himself to deal with... Wait, no, that&#39;s zombies, not  spambots. This probably explains why he had gotten cornered by one outside the Message Board without any belongings beyond his trusty hat, a knife, and the clothes on his back.<br>&quot;Ypur pics!&quot;<br>&quot;Get any closer, and I&#39;ll cutcha! Bugger it all, I&#39;m not dying here. I refuse to be killed before I&#39;m old enough to drink!&quot; Data exclaimed, charging the spambot. Not exactly his brightest idea, but it seemed that luck was on his side, and a knife in the torso was enough to distract the spambot long enough for Data to flee. He was unfortunately forced to leave the knife behind, unless he wanted to risk being his by the spambot&#39;s flailing limbs.<br>&quot;Dammit. That was a great knife. I&#39;ll have to come back for it after this is all over,&quot; he muttered as he ducked into the quickly-filling Message Board.</p>

            <p>Still holding the ice pack to her head, PitViper tossed the now-warm thermos back to SttQ and carefully got to her feet. Dizzyness made her sway, but she leaned on her bat again and adjusted her backpack straps on her shoulder.<br><br>She&#39;d taken a first aid course a couple of years before, and her instructor had pounded into her head that having a first aid kit was a necessity. One of these days, when all this crap was over with, she&#39;d have to put some ice packs in it.<br><br>&quot;I got some bandages in my pack,&quot; she said, half to herself. &quot;Rubber gloves, gauze, antibacterial wipes, and the like. I hope I have some fresh face barriers, might need those.&quot;<br><br>She could check through it again when she found a place to situate herself. With that in mind, she limped farther away from the chalk-marked road and slung her pack down. Quickly, and with one hand, she pulled out a sleeping pad and a couple of blankets, tossed them down, and spread them out as much as they could. Then, digging deeper in her pack, she pulled out a blue fanny pack. Her head was feeling better as she took this and headed toward the first aid area.</p>

            <p>PitViper sat down and opened this main zipper of her fanny pack.

            <p>&quot;Glad to hear that,&quot; she said, and absently began to sort through her kit again.

            <p>&quot;Apparently, in the first of these invasions, one of the Boarders managed to utilize them to fight trolls and spambots. What was her name... insanegrrl. It probably helped that they like eating sausages made of spambots. I don&#39;t know the fine details, but it&#39;s on the wiki.&quot;<br><br>She opened smaller pocket and found a well-stocked supply of moleskin. &quot;It doesn&#39;t help that most of this is stuff you&#39;d need during a camping trip, not a spambot attack.

            <p>&quot;Good thing there are Ypurs out there. However, thank you.

            <p>SttQ saw two Boarders busy with cameras and explosives, and sighed in relief. At least some people were working on the bunker&#39;s defenses. Offense wasn&#39;t doing nearly as well.<br><br>Checking whether her gun was loaded properly for what felt like the fiftieth time, SttQ looked around her. There were still only about five people in the armed-and-ready group, herself included. &#39;This is just brilliant,&#39; she thought. &#39;If the Bots break down the doors and some of them are able to get past the defense system, we have five, jeez, five people to protect everyone else here. How in hell are we gonna survive?&#39;<br><br>Just then, she heard a guy who had come in earlier, Sergio she thought his name was, saying something to PitViper and another girl about how he was out of ammo. She walked over to him and said, &quot;Hey, I saw several kinds of ammo piled up near the soapbox. Maybe there&#39;s something there for your pistol.&quot;</p>

            <p>Kyoki sidled through one of the side doors clutching a sleeping bag and wearing a rather bulging backpack while the spambots were distracted elsewhere. <br><br>As she set down her stuff, the bulging backpack started hissing in a rather alarming way. Opening the bag, Cat jumped out and painfully demonstrated her dissatisfaction with the indignity of being stuffed in a bag. Wincing, Kyoki walked around as quickly as possible to look for power plugs and get away from Cat until Cat calmed down. Kyoki was rather worried about her Bengal tiger. She wanted to bring him along, but figured that he&#39;d be happier outside the fortress batting around spambots for fun.<br><br>After finding some power plugs in the columns, Kyoki pulled out a power strip and set up her laptop, amongst the other electronic things she brought.<br><br>Smiling very happily, Kyoki reached into her bag and brought out her much beloved collection of explosives. With her explosives, she wandered off looking for spambots to explode.</p>

            <p>Niely trudged down the stairs of her apartment building, a small duffel on her back and a shotgun in her hand. <br><br>When she stepped outside she realized had already missed the main crowd. &quot;I guess I&#39;m late, as always&quot; she mumbled jokingly to herself. <br><br>She setup her shotgun inside of an abandoned pickup truck. An unlucky spambot took face-full  of lead, and Niely reloaded. She was just about to fire when a girl (with what looked like C4?) walked past. &quot;Hey!

            <p>&quot;Sticking together sounds like a great idea. And take your pick!&quot; said Kyoki as she opened her bag of explosives. &quot;Red colored ones have 5 second fuses, yellow ones are proximity triggered, and brown ones are 15 seconds.

Now that intros are done, take your pick!&quot; She held her open bag of explosives and said, &quot;Red ones are 5 seconds, yellow ones are proximity triggered, brown ones are 15...

            <p>&quot;Okay, is this enough cameras?  And explosives?  By the way, do these ever have short fuses?  Where did that pole go...  Ah.  Okay, and I do need some kind of short-range weapon if there&#39;s a spare, or I can just stick really close to you.  Or...&quot;  She weighed the pole and nodded.  &quot;I&#39;m sure I can swing the pole at them.  It might not be the most convenient weapon, but I&#39;m sure it would hurt even a spambot, so that should be fine, too.  So I&#39;m ready.<br>&quot;Except, what about the Ypurs?

            <p>&quot;That looks pretty good. And the fuses are exactly what I&#39;ve coded them as, and if anything they tend to have longer than intended fuses. I figured it&#39;d be better wondering why they haven&#39;t exploded yet, compared to being surprised by an early detonation.&quot; said Kyoki wryly. &quot;And I&#39;d heard from somebody that the Ypurs were bringing med supplies, so keep out of their way and leave them alone.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Now that we&#39;re mostly set, let&#39;s make a circle of the bunker to check our camera coverage and clear out some bots.

            <p>&quot;It&#39;s a good thing we aren&#39;t agents, or they <i>would</i> have short fuses,&quot; Elemarth commented, only half joking.  &quot;I was more concerned about whether accidentally getting in the Ypurs&#39; way would result in temporary inconvenience or me getting trampled.  But I&#39;ll just try to avoid the issue entirely and not find out.  I&#39;m ready.  Tell me when.&quot;  She hefted her pole.  &quot;I guess we should probably split into two groups to check the building.

            <p>&quot;But I want to go up to the roof to get an aerial view. Anyone want to come?&quot; Niely asked. &quot;I think that if I have a long plank of wood I can cross from rooftop to rooftop a rain fire from above onto the spambots.&quot; she said.<br><br>Throwing her bag over her back, she made her way towards the nearest building. The automatic doors had been shut off, so she fired her shotgun into the doors. Kicking aside the glass, she made her way to and up the stairs.</p>

            <p>Kyoki returned (after a therapeutic round of Explode the Spambot) in time to catch the tail end of Niely&#39;s decision.  Searching around, she found an extend-able ladder and followed Niely up the stairs.</p>

            <p>It was very windy. Checking to see if anyone was watching, Niely struck a quick superman pose before pulling out her sniper scope (really, it was just a monocular, but sniper scope sounds cooler) and scouted the area.<br><br>&quot;Great Seasons!&quot; she exclaimed. A whole army of spambots was marching  down the street, demolishing anything in their path.</p>

            <p>With one last clunk, Kyoki set down the ladder on a nearby wall. Quickly sticking a camera to a nice tall vantage point, she jogs over to Niely to check out what was the cause of the exclamation.<br><br>Growling at the sight of the spambot army, she started preparing the explosives she planned to use. &quot;Niely, when the spambots get in range I&#39;m gonna toss a few EMP bombs to slow them down. Get ready to use what ever you want.&quot; With that said, Kyoki powered up the EMP bombs - which began emitting a soft whirring noise.<br><br>As the spambots marched closer, the whirring noises from the bombs changed to an irritatingly loud whine. &quot;3...2...1! Fire in the hole!&quot; shouted Kyoki as she threw the bombs into the midst of the spambot army.</p>

            <p>&quot;EMP bombs are just for electronics, right?&quot; Elemarth yelled back up.  Her eyes stayed glued to the oncoming army.  &quot;But it won&#39;t be any good for our cameras.  I -- I think I need to run.&quot;<br><br>The next thing she should do, she knew, was get up to the roof.  It seemed like that was where the best action was.  But she had to get out of the way of all this first.  She chose a few bombs to cover her escape before the EMP bombs, threw them at the bots, and leaped back to the bunker.</p>

The flames had burned themselves out - there wasn&#39;t much to burn around there - and after the bombs and hairspray, there seemed to be enough bot-less space immediately around the bunker that she could dare it.

            <p>The bot starts posting at an odd hour of the day, posts the same message (or variations of it) several times a minute for about half an hour, then leaves.

Also, if you post in the middle of the bot&#39;s posting (look at the times of the posts - if the latest one was more than a couple minutes ago, you&#39;re probably safe), your post might get accidentally deleted as I go through and delete the pages upon pages of spam.</p>

I would also like to point out that in the post below this one, the posters seemed perfectly happy to chat with no apparent idea that Techno-Dann had posted anything at all, and the only person who&#39;s been implying that that means they&#39;re stupid is you. It may be unnecessary, but how the hell is one post potentially harmful? <br><br>On top of that, if people are going to school, and have lives, and things to get to, then they aren&#39;t going to post anything to begin with.

            <p>For one, no one is going to listen to you. You&#39;re just some random person who decided to say what&#39;s already been said without any regard at all for the fact that you have no authority, for one, and that for two, hardly anyone knows you as someone to listen to. How long have you been here? How much do you know personally? Why should those of us who have been here longer than you listen and allow you to continue in being obnoxious and presumptious?<br><br>You have no place stepping in at random to say what everyone&#39;s already seen. <br><br>Secondly, there is already a link up top, and on the wiki as well. The wiki was the very first thing updated with the news of the spambot attack, and it did include the link.<br><br> If you think that newbies will not be able to follow these simple links, you clearly have no respect for them or their intelligence. The average PPCer is smarter than the average cabbage, and they do not need their hands held so they can safely cross the street.<br><br>And that post you made can be potentially harmful because we do not know whether or not we are being deliberately targeted with this spam or not, and by providing a link in plain text you make it that much easier for the bot to jump to the other board as well. In short, if the bot jumped from this forum to the other because of your post, it would be all your fault. <br><br>It is being directed through an advanced proxy that allows it access to multiple IP addresses which makes it difficult to ban and pin down. It grabs usernames from the proper space and then fills it in correctly. You tell me how it is not dangerous to provide further information to it if it is fully automated and fairly intelligent.<br><br>I know this because I was one of the ones helping with figuring out what was going on and helping with the discussions as to what to do.<br><br>And your final response is completely useless, and has nothing to do with the reasoning behind my post. If it&#39;s only been twelve hours, and it is in the middle of the school and work day, people have not had the time to come online and see in likelihood, nor would they necessarily have the time to post. The act that you presume it will go any faster with further prodding is ridiculous because the only thing we can do is wait it out. Stop presuming things.<br><br><br><br>Additionally, BOTHER. BOTHER.
