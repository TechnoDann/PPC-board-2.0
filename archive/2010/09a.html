            <p>Remember waaaaay back when Agent Shinra and Agent Ueru used to work together? And that they had four (or was it five? six?) failed weddings and then just gave up? About the same time I went into lurk mode for a really long time?<br><br>Well, been going through my agents and their histories and Ueru ended up one of the many who died during one of the invasions. However, this is has nothing to do with that~!<br><br>This is me trying to ask if anyone wants their agent to make a small appearance in some backstory I finally dragged out of storage and decided to finally write. A.K.A. The eventual marriage of Agent Shinra and Agent Ueru. Because, you know, it&#39;s about friggin&#39; time.<br><br>Any takers? If not, I don&#39;t mind. I&#39;ll just put a bunch of nameless agents in the reception. =D<br><br>~Keily, who&#39;s happy to be writing something not!depressing again</p>

Like I said, I have a lot of agents to choose from, and since a lot of them haven&#39;t had the chance to appear in my writings yet, have to explain who they are and such. But thanks.

            <p>Neshomeh summed up my feelings on this mission pretty well when she said &quot;I didn&#39;t really get a sense of what was so wrong with the fic (other than turning someone into a naga).&quot; Speaking as someone who&#39;s read Naga Eyes without the benefit of the &#39;Saltines and Sprite&#39; MST treatment, I can say with authority that is not a problem you should have with this text. You needed to make it more clear why this fic is so bad, be that through quotes or agent reactions.<br><br>Explaining what vore was right off the bat could have helped. The story you used was okay, but for something like vore you need to be blunt.<br><br>I enjoyed the first few paragraphs, don&#39;t get me wrong. But this could have really been improved had you just set it aside until you had the time to really flesh it out.<br><br>Also, there are no centaurs in Kingdom Hearts.</p>

            <p>Guess I could&#39;ve done a better job explaining why the story was bad. One of the big problems I had was that I couldn&#39;t find an unsporked version, which made it hard to get the full awfulness of the story.<br><br><br>I also should&#39;ve done more research on Kingdom Hearts. All I know about it is that it&#39;s a video game that merges Disney Canon and Square-Enix. I figured since there were centaurs in Fantasia, it would be legit.<br><br>So, yeah. More research and clearer reasoning behind fic badness. That being said, probably gonna stick to my balliwack now. (Buffy Badfic all the way!)</p>

            <p>It seemed like the banter between the agents was good, as was the content of the story itself, but I do think that you could have made it a bit longer - even if you were rushing. On the other hand, I snickered when Caroline lobbed a ray gun at Tadkeeta, and again when they took down Nagariku. X3 One thing I was curious about was Caroline&#39;s whole horse thing; at first I thought Caroline might have had a horse phobia when she was a kid, as the word &#39;pang&#39; usually comes with a negative stigma, but later on she was actually happy to go hopping on Tadkeeta. You may want to reword that.</p>

            <p>Basically good but for the sorts of things that not rushing and/or getting a beta would fix, but I didn&#39;t really get a sense of what was so wrong with the fic (other than turning someone into a naga).<br><br>Also, I&#39;m not familiar with <i>Kingdom Hearts</i>, but are there centaurs in that &#39;verse?

            <p>I&#39;ve got a rough cut of my Danny/Laura Bad Parody mission and I&#39;d appreciate someone giving it a go-through. If you&#39;re not familiar with the Mass Effect universe, that&#39;s okay.

            <p>that would be easier to carry than the box alone, and she had a feeling she&#39;d need to keep her hands free. Then she and SttQ went over to the door. Galenfea peered out first, the image of two orcish arrows slamming into the wall near Boromir&#39;s head going through her mind&#39;s eye in a flash. She couldn&#39;t see anything, though.<br>&quot;Come on,&quot; she breathed, slipping out. SttQ closed the door behind her; it looked just like part of the wall from the outside, and Galenfea hoped they&#39;d be able to find it again. Together, they headed off down a small, ominously silent side-street. Several of the houses had broken windows and doors, and Galenfea eyed the dark holes uneasily, aware of how easily bots might be lying in ambush.</p>

            <p>SttQ didn&#39;t like this. It was too quiet. She and Galenfea had been dodging in and out of alleys for fifteen minutes now, and they hadn&#39;t seen a single live spambot. Or Ypur, for that matter. Was the invasion over? If so, where were the people? While there had been many Boarders in the bunker, the city&#39;s population was a lot bigger than that. So, again, where <i> was </i> everyone?<br><br>Not a sound could be heard, save that of the two girls&#39; steps as they ran across the deserted street to yet another alleyway, and the croaking of the crows circling high over their heads.

            <p>whispered Galenfea. She was also unnerved by the silence and emptiness, and the crows circling overhead. Her friends said she&#39;d read too many fantasy books at an impressionable age, but she&#39;d always been unnerved by circling birds, especially carrion birds. What did bots do to people they caught, anyway?<br>She shuddered and put the thought from her head.<br>Suddenly she heard something other than the sound of her own feet and SttQ&#39;s. It sounded like another pair of feet, moving slowly but purposefully along the road at the end of their alley.

Galenfea, get behind me!&quot;<br>SttQ jumped to the middle of the alleyway, planted her feet firmly on the ground and raised her gun. If what she feared was true, she was going to nail the damn thing right between the eyes.</p>

            <p>and fell into step with her. As she talked, she occasionally shot a glance over her shoulder.<br><br>&quot;There <i> is</i> a fairly easy way to get there, but it&#39;ll take a bit longer. If we turn right at the end of this street, then left at Simon&#39;s Soup Shop, it&#39;s about a quarter of a mile to the videogame store. There, we turn into Beech Avenue (you know, the one with all the oak trees), and after half a mile, we&#39;ll reach the zoo. If we go into the alley that runs next to and behind the zoo, we&#39;ll be able to enter Mr. Macy&#39;s back garden by breaking away some boards; they&#39;re practically rotten, so that shouldn&#39;t be a problem. Then, we traverse a few back gardens (don&#39;t worry, the walls separating them are fairly low) till we reach mine. And yes, I did remember to bring my keys. This way, we won&#39;t even have to see the cemetery.&quot;</p>

            <p>&quot;All right,&quot; she said. &quot;I live down a side street from Beech, so that&#39;s not far out of our way anyway. I&#39;m <i>definitely</i> prepared to climb over and under some fences to avoid having to go past the cemetary during a zombie attack.&quot;<br>She peered nervously around another corner before darting across an alleyway. The sun was beginning to get low in the sky and the alleyways and narrower side-streets now looked almost as threatening as the empty doors and windows of the houses. Still, it was probably best to keep to the sides of the road - less chance of being seen themseves, and potential hiding places for zombies and bots were also potential hiding places for her and SttQ.<br>As they reached the end of the street, though, she paused at the sound of a metallic scraping from around the corner on the right.</p>

            <p>A controversial <h1><a href="http://www.coachoutletonlinegg.com/" title="Coach Outlet Online">Coach Outlet Online</a></h1> edict issued by Egypt&#39;s president - which <h1><a href="http://www.coachoutletonlineaol.net/" title="Coach Outlet Online">Coach Outlet Online</a></h1> spurred vigorous, sometimes violent protests <h1><a href="http://www.coachfactoryoutletwy.com/" title="Coach Factory Outlet">Coach Factory Outlet</a></h1> by those calling it a dictatorial power grab - &quot;will fall immediately&quot; if voters approve a new constitution later this month, the country&#39;s prime minister said.<br>Echoing President <h1><a href="http://www.coachoutletstorefc.com/" title="Coach Outlet Store">Coach Outlet Store</a></h1> Mohamed Morsy and other government officials, Prime Minister Hesham Kandil <h1><a href="http://www.coachoutletaol.org/" title="Coach Outlet">Coach Outlet</a></h1> said the November 21 decree that made Morsy&#39;s past and future <h1><a href="http://www.coachfactoryonlineest.net/" title="Coach Factory Online">Coach Factory Online</a></h1>  decisions immune to judicial oversight was issued &quot;to protect the process of building the democratic institutions.&quot;<br>Regardless, <h1><a href="http://www.coachfactoryoutletpst.com/" title="Coach Factory Outlet">Coach Factory Outlet</a></h1> Kandil told CNN&#39;s Christiane Amanpour that it should <h1><a href="http://www.coachfactoryoutlettx.com/" title="Coach Factory Outlet">Coach Factory Outlet</a></h1> be a moot point after December 15, when Egyptians will approve <h1><a href="http://www.coachfactoryonlinefc.org/" title="Coach Factory Online">Coach Factory Online</a></h1> or reject a new constitution in a nationwide referendum.<br>&quot;We&#39;re talking about <h1><a href="http://www.coachoutletwy.com/" title="Coach Outlet">Coach Outlet</a></h1> one hour (and) 12 days until this declaration drops,&quot; the prime minister <h1><a href="http://www.coachoutletonlineybw.com/" title="Coach Outlet Online">Coach Outlet Online</a></h1> said late Monday night. &quot;So I don&#39;t think people should worry about the declaration.

            <p>Finally, she said, &quot;It... would make sense. These things are nearly brainless, but not completely. They&#39;re predators, and all predators instinctively know it helps not to be seen. So, yeah, you&#39;re probably right. But as long as we keep away from too-dark corners, we should be fine. After all, these things are slow and anything but subtle. We&#39;ll always hear them coming.&quot;</p>

            <p>even more so.&quot;<br>Galenfea squinted. At least without artificial light her eyes were adjusting well to the dark. She could see the shape of the sign she was heading for and moved out into the middle of the road to keep away from doorways, broken windows and alleyways. SttQ walked beside her, shotgun at the ready. Galenfea didn&#39;t like guns as a rule - came of growing up in a country where they were all kinds of illegal, she guessed - but she had to admit that she was glad of this one.<br>Fortunately, they made it to the soup shop without incident. Galenfea had never seen it dark. Somehow that was creepier than anything else.</p>

            <p>at the soup shop. Suddenly, she said, &quot;You know, just yesterday evening, I was in there with a couple of friends, celebrating a birthday. God, I hope they&#39;re safe. We always used to hang out there. Seems like years ago now. Weird what a day can... Wait a minute.&quot; She stopped and turned towards the shop, all senses on the alert. &quot;Did that door just open a little?&quot;</p>

            <p>The dim light might have been playing tricks with her eyes, but she thought that the dark space where the door was ajar did widen a little. On the other hand, when she looked at another shadow for comparison she thought the same - maybe it really <i>was</i> just the light?<br>She looked harder, leaning forwards a little.<br>&quot;I&#39;m not sure,&quot; she said quietly, but looked around for a weapon, just in case, and started to edge past the shop towards the sidestreet on the left. Weapon... weapon... even a stout stick would do. Surely zombies would go down the same as anything else if beaten about the head, and even bots must have some breakable electronics.<br>They were even with the door now, and Galenfea shot it a nervous look. Maybe it was just the dark playing tricks with her, but the opening <i>did</i> look a little bigger.<br>At that moment she also heard the squeak of a badly-oiled hinge from the other side of the street and froze, hissing a swear word through her teeth.<br>&quot;What now?&quot; she whispered, still staring at the soup shop. &quot;Hide? Run? Panama?&quot;<br><br>((PS: &#39;Panama&#39; is a Clive Cussler reference, in case you&#39;re curious. :P))</p>

            <p>Fixed the typos.  To be honest... I&#39;ve said it enough already, but the main difference here is basically contraindicating Cameron&#39;s official description of Earth, which some have pegged as the apocalypse scenario from the environmentalism of the 1970s (Cameron&#39;s Generation).  If there&#39;s fusion, where does the air pollution come from?  As the population increases and exploitation space expands, Earths value shifts from land and resources to the amount of food it can produce and the quality of life for it&#39;s inhabitants.   </p>

            <p>I think that the introduction showed more insight than the original introduction; but, you can always stuff more into all 200 pages of a very good book than you can a very good movie.

            <p>Having seen the movie since the previous discussion and now, I definitely appreciate what you&#39;ve written a good bit more. It&#39;s rather good - provides a lot more context than the original, even if it has yet to diverge very much.</p>

            <p>This chapter is more about relating how... overblown I thought  Camerons depiction (or tale) of an environmentally decrepit Earth seemed to me.  Warmer, certainly.  More erratic climate? We&#39;re getting that now. Higher ocean levels? Very likely.  Ocean warming, de-oxygenation and acidification?  Very unfortunate and possibly calamitous due to the speed.<br><br>However... non of that, combined with modern population forecasts (of 10-12 billion as opposed to a whopping 32), could  account for the mess that Cameron predicts.<br><br>Also, RDA here is an arm of the UN and, by the time Jake arrives, will have just installed an instantaneous Comm connection with earth.

            <p>For one, March Madness went so well this year that I intend to do it again (although I probably won&#39;t offer drawings as prizes again, since at the rate I&#39;m going I won&#39;t have this year&#39;s ones done yet &gt;.&gt;).<br><br>Also, sometime in December I like to challenge people to write PPC-themed parodies of holiday songs, so you&#39;ve got that to look forward to. Most of them are archived <a href="http://starshadowhall.tripod.com/ppc/songbook.html">here</a>, though I haven&#39;t got last year&#39;s up yet and there are some really old ones I need to add, too. I&#39;ll get around to it when it comes time for the event.<br><br>We also observe the <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/May_25">Glorious 25th of May</a>, since three important events all fall on it; not to mention the 25th of March, which is the day the One Ring was destroyed. <s>Why yes, we are a bunch of nerds, thank you!</s><br><br>Other things tend to happen semi-regularly, too, such as snow fights when the world turns winterish for the majority of us.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I am not a very big and this still scares me.<br><br>This is just a list of things I spotted that bug me:<br><br>1) It&#39;s Peninsula of Haemus or Chersónēsos tou Haímou if you want to stay in Greek, not Balkan Peninsula. That term was first used in the late 1400s and was not common until the 1800s.<br><br>2) Andromache was not a daughter of Zuse, the old thunderbolt normally did not favor his mortal offspring, and he would never give them or their decedents immortality.<br><br>3) Evangelia is a rare variant Evangeline. Evangeline is an old Greek name, but not that old.<br><br>4) Can&#39;t prove it, but fairly sure Damien is a modern name. it does have French/Greek origins, but I cannot find a reference connecting it to Troy.<br><br>And this was just in the first 300 words.<br><br>Then again I cannot talk much considering I like a Harry Potter Firefly crossover. In my defense it is well written and, as impossible as that may sound, stays loyal to both source materials.<br><br></p>

Two characters, referred to as the Prince and Kaileena, are on a boat, traveling away from the Island of Time. This may seem like an awkward way of phrasing it, but these two are not, repeat, NOT the Prince and Kaileena as we know them.<br><br>The Prince has fallen victim to Character Rupture on a grandiose scale. The big tough badass from &#39;Warrior Within&#39; has been turned into a sickening blend of lecher, therapy counsellor, crybaby and prudish priest. Obviously, his speech and behavioral patterns have been wrenched beyond recognition.<br>Example: the Prince would never, EVER stand for another man pinching him in the butt.<br><br>Kaileena is, well, not Kaileena at all anymore. I strongly suspect full-scale Character Replacement. Maybe it&#39;s just me, but somehow I can&#39;t picture her as the<br>&quot;my-daddy-started-raping-me-on-a-regular-basis-when-I-was-fourteen-and-even-though-I-hated-it-with-every-fiber-of-my-being-I-sorta-kinda-ended-up-liking-it&quot;-type.<br><br>Yes, you read that right: the authoress says that she (replacement!Kaileena) ended up ENJOYING getting raped by her own father!<br><br>Need I say more? Okey-dokey.<br><br>1. Replacement!Kaileena&#39;s two (OC) sisters also got raped by daddy and enjoyed it (plus we get a hint of twincest), one of her (OC) brothers was reviled by daddy for being a homosexual, and the other brother is a complete (albeit heavily clichéd) psycho.<br><br>2.The authoress&#39; grasp of the English language is nothing short of terrible: her punctuation stinks, she constantly uses words that she doesn&#39;t even understand correctly (&quot;Her spine crackled.&quot;), the Pronoun Problem shows itself now and then, words that should be there are dropped, words that should not be there are squeezed in anyway, sentence fragments are all over the place, and the sentences themselves are often just plain stupid. Example: &quot;Kaileena&#39;s stomach bubbled with indecision.&quot; What on earth does that mean? That she&#39;s hungry and doesn&#39;t know what she wants to eat?<br>Spelling? Ooooh boy. Grammar? Don&#39;t go there.<br><br>3. The authoress contradicts herself. A lot. As in, one hundred times per chapter.<br><br>4. Calling the Department of Redundancy Department! And how. Sometimes (well, all the time actually) we get ten sentences for the price of one.<br><br>5. The dialogue is so painfully stilted it&#39;s almost hilarious. No-one on earth talks like this. You get more natural conversations in grammar guides. Also, way too much unnecessary exposition.<br><br>6. Anachronisms. There simply were no glasses in ancient Persia.<br><br>7. There&#39;s some mangled Olde English in there too.<br><br>8. The OC sisters can malletspace! Their clothing consists solely of two or three strips of transparent fabric, but they pull out tridents anyway!<br><br>9. The big fight scenes are bizarre and, towards the end, just plain sick, and the conversations between the opponents read like the minutes of a support group meeting.<br><br>10. The authoress&#39; view of the &#39;Eye of the Storm&#39;-power (NOT called &#39;Slow Time&#39;) is, in my opinion, totally unrealistic. If it causes everything except the wielder of said power to slow down, enemies should not have trouble breathing or anything, since all their vital functions have slowed down as well.<br><br>10. The Prince, by all accounts, is in his twenties, not middle-aged, and certainly not withered.<br><br>11. I retract my previous statement. The entire fic reads like the minutes of a support group meeting. Attended by dimwits.<br><br>12. Now I&#39;m reminded of that scene with the fairy godmothers and the newborn princess. Brilliant.<br><br>13. The prince can configure himself to withstand attacks. Le gasp! He is Borg!<br><br>13. Stop. Talking.<br><br>14. The final chapter is cataclysmically stupid, and oh yeah, the whole thing ends with healing secks.<br><br>There&#39;s a whole lot more to say, but I will only add this. In later chapters, the writing reaches a level of badness that&#39;s actually surreal. You&#39;re horrified, but you can&#39;t stop giggling. It&#39;s THAT bad.<br><br>I apologize for the length of this post. It&#39;s just that this fic... is... nrk...<br><br>GAH!<br><br>Should I put this up on Unclaimed? (Like I even need to ask.)</p>

            <p>...but if there&#39;s no mini already listed for the Prince of Persia continuum, then I suppose that if you were to claim it (which you can do freely before your newbie-month is up) then you would do the honors.

The fanfics I&#39;m planning are still in the conceptual stage, so I have no sample of my mad writing skillz to show you. Therefore, would it be acceptable if I wrote the mission (in OpenOffice, for example) and then posted one or more fragments of it on the Board for you guys to judge?</p>

            <p>...More like guidelines. But in any case, the Dahaka sounds perfect.  <br><br>As for the Permission Request...<br><br>Well, one well-established method for the sample is to depict the Agent&#39;s first meeting. These are rarely longer than a page, and are quick and easy to dash out. <br><br>On the other hand, for my request I cut-n-pasted my first mission (which I had already written by accident) from Word into GoogleDocs, posted the link along with a few lines about my characters, and waited a few days for one of the PG&#39;s to notice it. As far as I know I&#39;m the first to have done it like that, and nobody gave a damn. <br><br>The writing sample really isn&#39;t something to stress too much about.

            <p>Last things first; does anyone willing to co-write a mission have any Bad Slashers or Floaters who work the Harry Potter continuum and are likely to know anything about the music of Nine Inch Nails? I ask because a fic I&#39;ve bagged for sporking is a NIN songfic which utterly mutilates the lyrics of one of my favourite songs (the song being &quot;Suck&quot;, in case you&#39;re wondering). The Bad Slashers I use are probably not the type to listen to NIN&#39;s music even when it&#39;s not being mangled horribly, and I&#39;m kind of hoping to have them do some things without Laburnum and Foxglove hanging off them.<br><br>I&#39;d also like to report the appearance of three Mini-Balrogs I haven&#39;t seen around before: Bradybuck, Brandyduck, and Bradyduck. (Quack.)<br><br>As for the sporkables, they&#39;re all Harry Potter fics found via TVTropes:<br><a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/ASadStory"><a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/ASadStory">http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/ASadStory</a></a><br><a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/Deserving"><a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/Deserving">http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/Deserving</a></a><br><a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/DarkSecrets"><a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/DarkSecrets">http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/DarkSecrets</a></a><br><a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/PassionNight"><a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/PassionNight">http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/PassionNight</a></a><br><br>Speaking of TVTropes, I set up a BagEnders page: <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/BagEnders"><a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/BagEnders">http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/BagEnders</a></a> Anyone want to fill in some tropes there?</p>

            <p>Well, Rose/Ross are at least passable in Hary potter, and while they might not really know anything about NIN&#39;s music, I can see that as being the basis for a lot of amusement, actually. Along the lines of &quot;Wait, I was selected for this mission based on one album that my ex loaded onto my computer years ago and I listened to enough to decide it wasn&#39;t worth my time?&quot; quickly followed by &quot;Wait, this doesn&#39;t even sound like the same band!

            <p>... completely screws up the lyrics. I&#39;m thinking the song plays over the action, as has been mentioned happening in songfics before, but now it&#39;s horribly off-key. Sounds right?</p>

            <p>Sounds just about right. I know in the last songfic I had to tackle (thankfully it was only a chapter of a larger fic) the ficcer changed a couple of the words, and those were screechily sung off-key over the real words. So perhaps in this case it would be mostly screech with a few points of actual song? </p>

            <p>I&#39;m not sure if that counts as a Mini because I&#39;ve never seen it in fic, but my sister was convinced for a while that Merry was in fact a girl, because his name sounds kind of like &quot;Mary&quot;.

            <p>So. I know a fair number of us draw, and I know for a fact that most of us write or at least like good writing. <br><br>I have a challenge. <br><br>While looking through the DeviantArt gallery of one of my favorite artists that I hadn&#39;t looked at in a while, I noticed that she had stopped drawing the usual, stick-skinny, &quot;Pretty&quot; in the conventional sense girls that used to dominate her gallery, and, among other things, was posting drawings of her own outfits, which, given that she&#39;s on the large side, were all large, and drawn to actually look how they look on her. For instance: <br><br><a href="http://www.deviantart.com/deviation/177975975/"><img src="http://th04.deviantart.net/fs71/150/f/2010/246/1/3/ootd_7_10_10_by_alexheberling-d2xyn53.png"></a><br><br>This got me thinking. Why don&#39;t more writers/artists represent those of us who are not, in fact, a size two? I find myself guilty of this, as well. <br><br>So here&#39;s my challenge: <br><br>Find a character who is (actually) average to overweight. Draw them how they normally/actually look. Don&#39;t make them look disgusting just because they&#39;re fat. <br><br>Said character can be your own, or someone else&#39;s. They can be for published or unpublished work. Just go forth and find a character who isn&#39;t tiny. <br><br>Draw them how they normally look. Normal clothes, normal hair, normal facial expression and stance. Or draw them looking fancy, doing something special. You pick. <br><br>Finally: Post a link here. <br><br>So. Who will take up my challenge? *scuttles away* </p>

However, these fangirls go after these guys such as this Orlando Bloom dude here. For all we know, some of these guys could be happily dating or married, some of these guys victims that wouldn&#39;t put &quot;romance&quot; on the top of their prorities, and some of these guys being just plain nuts.<br><br>Overall, fangirls writing fanfiction about their fantasies with real-life people= very, very, very extremely creepy.</p>

            <p>I have a red link in a wiki article I need to fill.

I have got a page started now that basically says &quot;Well, bad parody is parody fic that&#39;s badfic,&quot; but that&#39;s not good enough for me.<br><br>So what&#39;s your opinion?

Another Lord of the Rings Parody?</a> by kitt_otter PG  <br>Summary: ‘Fraid so. Frodo’s a stinker and Bilbo’s worse. Sauron’s beard is pointy and his minions wield chainsaws. Aragorn couldn&#39;t find his nose in the dark. And the worst of it…? Gandalf owes me money. <br><br>It does, I suppose, follow the basic plot, but most of the humour seems to centre on making the canon characters either stupid or mean, regardless of their actual canon personalities, plus the entirely unecessary addition of modern technology.<br><br>For example, this? Isn&#39;t funny, it&#39;s stupid:<br><br>“I think you’ve had it long enough – magic rings should be shared, not hoarded for two thousand years. Let it go.” <br>“Oho! Oho! I see; you want it all for yourself, don’t you, Gandalf?<br>“Well – I – well – no – I -- ”<br>The Eye of the Monkey crackled as dangerously as the eyes of its holder. “Then take this – Kreeahh!” Bilbo flipped overhead; Gandalf stumbled back, and they met staff-to-staff, thus beginning a very messy duel. In the end, they called it a draw, having hit Bilbo’s stuff more than each other. <br>“Alright then, here’s the Thing.” Bilbo carelessly tossed a small shiny ring onto the oliphaunt-skin rug. He met Flópi outside with an over-packed wagon. “No hard feelings,” he said, shaking Gandalf’s hand. There was a buzz of electricity, and Gandalf’s beard sizzled outward from every angle. “So long, schmo. And watch out for Frodo!” <br>Gandalf watched the old crackpot hop down the hill and the eerie blue flames that rose from Hobbiton afterward. </p>

            <p>Bad parody is what you have when you don&#39;t have good parody.<br><br>What would you expect to see in a good parody? Probably the characters in character acting out the fandom cliches. I once read a parody where the characters seemed to be more or less aware of the cliches. Or at least, they asked each other about them. &quot;Why do you always sing that song?&quot; &quot;We don&#39;t know any other songs.&quot;<br><br>Humor is subjective.

            <p>I find cheap shots at characters and plot put me off. Plainly insulting the continuum or the original author also shows little effort. <br><br>I can say that a <i>good</i> parody tells the reader something about the original piece in a way that criticism might. Then I suppose a <i>bad</i> parody would not take the author&#39;s intent into account and, as I noted above, just take cheap shots of everything. It needs to get to the heart of the original piece, and then dissect it for better or worse. And if it doesn&#39;t do that...then in my opinion, it&#39;s a bad parody.<br><br>Mind, this is the opinion of one who hasn&#39;t read much parody at all.</p>

            <p>There will always be room for argument depending on a person&#39;s particular sense of humour, so I&#39;d say the DBP would be restricted to the sort of thing that no one (in their right mind) would find funny - cheap jokes about death (or murder), OOCness for no reason other than to be the butt of jokes, and inane plot devices would all be flashing warnign signs in my book.<br><br>Regardless, this is why I stay away from parody fic in general.

            <p>...is probably another example of &quot;OOCness for no reason other than to be the butt of jokes.&quot; Danny and Laura&#39;s last mission dealt with exactly that. Actually it&#39;s what inspired me to start asking these questions to begin with, because what they PPC&#39;d was definitely bad parody--only I wasn&#39;t sure what exactly made it bad parody.

            <p>Just taking cheap shots at everything to be petty is very bad, yes. But taking the things you object to within the canon and deconstructing them down to the ground - that can definitely be interesting. Terrifying deconstructive sparklepire fic comes to mind.</p>

            <p>&quot;For a long time, there has been a debate at Headquarters concerning the effects of humor on the continuum. Said debate questions whether humor fics have any effect on the continuum at all, and if so, how much? Most people believe that a fic&#39;s impact depends on two things: 1) its subject matter, and 2) its genuine humor content. A well-handled comedy that is genuinely funny is thought to cause little damage to the continuum, regardless of the plot. Some kinds of comedies also do little damage, even if they aren&#39;t all that funny. Stuff like bogus diaries by unlikely individuals, e.g. Bill the Pony, and fics set in chatrooms have little impact on the continuum. List fics also don&#39;t harm the continuum, no matter how inane they are.<br><br>The comedy fics that do the most harm are the ones that try to tell an actual story, have serious elements, and aren&#39;t as funny as their creator thinks they are. They also tend to rehash the same jokes that other people have used. (If I have to read one more &quot;comic&quot; account of the Council of Elrond, I swear I&#39;ll scream....)&quot;<br><br>Don&#39;t know how helpful this is, but it might give you an idea of what would make a good mission for Bad Parody, which isn&#39;t always the same as what IS a bad parody - some fics, however awful they are to read, just aren&#39;t easily sporkable.</p>

            <p>Keep in mind that while those three elements mentioned can be bad when used together, they are not necessarily bad when used separately. Case in point: Those Lacking Spines. It genuinely does have a plot, it does seem to be serious on a few minor occasions, and its author thinks it&#39;s funny (big thing is, everyone else agrees). Pretty much agreed to be one of the most hilarious stories written in the KH fandom.</p>

            <p>If the jokes made at the expense of the subject being parodied come off less as funny or clever and more as petty or cruel, that might very well be indicative of a bad parody. A good parody will not outright attack its source material, or if it does it will at least temper itself with some self-referential humor.<br><br>Stupid or obvious jokes are another major concern, as is overusing well-known memes.

            <p>So I&#39;m curious - How are agents normally recruited?<br><br>With the exception of agents recruited outright by existing PPC agents, the PPC missions I&#39;ve read (Jay and Acacia, Laburnum and Foxglove) are very vague as to how the (non-fandom-originating) agents were recruited. <br><br>I am dreaming up potential PPC agents to write eventually/apply for Permission with, but trying to figure out origin is a bit tricky when most of the Agents I&#39;ve read have kind of vague origins.</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve got two agents, and they were recruited each in a different way. The first one, Sergio Turbo, was intended to be the main character of an original fiction that got cancelled, and so he joined PPC in order to have something to do and avoid to disapppar. Corolla, instead, got recruited by Sergio, that officially found her in a badfinc still alive when she was supposed to have died with some other background characters. Officially, because in fact that badfic does not exist (however, if I find a suitable one, I can use it as a sort of flashback)</p>

            <p>Well, the others have mostly covered it, so I&#39;ll just add that you don&#39;t always have to specify - my Agent Sedri, for example, definitely came from World One at some point, but has been a PPC agent for so long that her pre-PPC life is all but irrelevant. On the other hand, I&#39;m getting quite bored with that storyline, so I may well go and flesh out her background a bit more - as you say, it helps a great deal to know that sort of thing. </p>

            <p>When I started writing Nume, I had no idea how he got here (the answer would&#39;ve been &quot;he just did, okay?&quot;). Over time, though, he began to tell me about his former life, so I know now; not to mention lots of other things, such as his real name. Those details don&#39;t really come up in my PPC stories, because they aren&#39;t important to him anymore, but it is fun to find out about them. {= )<br><br>Writing badfic recruits like Ilraen and Derik is a different experience altogether, because there aren&#39;t those mysteries about them. I know everything there is to know about where they came from and what has happened to them so far, so the only question left for them is &quot;what are you going to do now?&quot; Ilraen has somehow managed to be fairly stable and is traveling down a path that will keep making him stronger; Derik, on the other hand, is quite liable to lose what&#39;s left of his mind, and I have no idea what he&#39;ll do next. It&#39;s a little challenging to write him. In a way it makes them more dynamic characters, because all of their developments are happening in the present, and yet they also start out shallower. Nume is deeper as a character, yet I didn&#39;t think he could develop much until the last mission. Up until then he was the straight man to Ilraen&#39;s fall guy, but now he&#39;s shown me a way to shake him up. It&#39;s going to be so much fun. *eg*<br><br>... Um, I got a little off-topic there.

            <p>They&#39;re recruited because their authors say they are.<br><br>There are two possible perspectives on who an Author is in the PPC. First possibility: Authors are people who can tap into parallel universes and write about them. That would mean the characters have free will, but their Author is basically spying on them through the power of imagination. Second possibility: An Author can actually create parallel universes. In that case, a character is like a sub-program running inside the mind of the Author...<br><br>In any event, most PPC agents from World One drop into HQ through plot holes. World One is special precisely because of its numerous plot holes and the many Authors who take advantage of them, writing anything from legendary epics like &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; to legendary badfic.<br><br>So, yeah. They drop in through plot holes. A few have somewhat more elaborate recruitments; my agent, Jason, answered a classified ad for a custodial worker and found himself working at HQ Janitorial, but like most World One agents, he walked into HQ through a plot hole.</p>

            <p>As the others have said, there are plenty of methods used to recruit new Agents. Some of the more common are:<br><br>- rescuing abused or ignored bit-characters.<br>- people stumbling into the PPC through plotholes, most often from World One but not infrequently from canon worlds.<br>- people outright applying for jobs at the PPC, and being brought in for interviews and inevitable hiring.<br><br>A less common, but still viable, method of recruitment is to have active Agents going home and recruiting friends or family.<br><br>I find that developing my Agents&#39; backstories and personalities can help a lot with writing them. <a href="http://docs.google.com/View?id=ddkcfxr6_164fcwrfrc6">This questionnaire in particular</a> has proven itself very handy, and I&#39;ve used it for a good number of mine.<br><br>Hope all that helps.</p>

            <p>... Laburnum was an OFU student turned teenage runaway, as detailed roughly here: <a href="http://rc88.dreamwidth.org/7017.html"><a href="http://rc88.dreamwidth.org/7017.html">http://rc88.dreamwidth.org/7017.html</a></a><br><br>I&#39;m going to work on a bit of backstory for Foxglove which I don&#39;t really want to spoil too much, but she was also an OFU student who decided that PPC life looked more fun than Real World life and joined up. Her parents and siblings know where she is, and tell anyone who asks that she got a scholarship to an overseas boarding school.</p>

            <p>But my Agent(s), as well as that of my little sister, were recommended to check out the PPC as a potential career opportunity by a teacher at our highschool, whom we currently suspect might be a former Agent himself.

            <p>Which, actually, isn&#39;t that bad of a song, but it&#39;s... Whiny and emo and pretty at the same time, and the band seems to be hugely popular among the more &quot;Artistic&quot; and &quot;Sensitive&quot; strain of thirteen year old girls.

            <p>... is a fanvid about Kovu from Lion King 2 based on &quot;The Chimbley Sweep&quot;, which a) has nothing to do with him in the slightest and b) is a decidedly creepy song to pick. I can&#39;t help but wonder if the maker actually listened to the third verse there. (Anyone familiar with the song will know what I mean.) Then there was a creepy pro-anorexia vid with &quot;Odalisque&quot; as backing music, and I&#39;m baffled as to why.<br><br>Could be worse. I heard rumours of &quot;My Friends&quot; from Sweeney Todd being used as the backing music for a slideshow of pictures of ponies. Yeah.</p>

            <p>Though the Higurashi one to &quot;Miss Lucy Had Some Leeches&quot; was pretty good.

            <p>A truly great fanfic is in its early genesis period.  Go to fanfiction.net and look for the zero City saga by ZC Founders.  A very well-crafted video game crossover saga set in our world, as... well, a great many things are happening (and are going to).  Check it out.  Spread the word.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m afraid I don&#39;t recognise your name. Are you new here? If so, it&#39;s generally considered polite to introduce yourself in a post before recommending fics, particularly if you don&#39;t include links. It makes you look like a troll and, since we&#39;ve been harrassed by quite a few trolls and spambots lately, that makes us somewhat less than friendly about it.

            <p>I&#39;m a lurker of the internet itself, and thought that I should talk in the wiki. Anyway, I&#39;m just a human being who loves reading fiction, often listens to music, and sometimes wouldn&#39;t mind reading a good book (Sorry, I&#39;m not generally the type to give out my information all at once). <br><br>I like reading stories (and currently working on one myself), but I don&#39;t mind fanfiction. However though, it seems that I usually come across ones by fangirls, sadly, so I only see not stories, but their wet dreams and fantasies in text. Looking up the PPC, however, it seems that I&#39;m not the only one bothered by this (and it feels good to know that). Anyway, I hope to get well acquainted here.</p>

            <p>I would like to join this when I get permission, but due to certain things, I might need to wait, so yeah. If I could, though, then I would like to go looking for some badfic on this here internet, and expand on some concepts such as these Anthropomorphic Personification stuff such as Discworld&#39;s Death. <br>Even then, I&#39;m not too good at writing in-character in fanfiction: However, I do know that Hermione isn&#39;t a whore, Ron isn&#39;t a Complete Monster, Draco isn&#39;t an almighty sex-god that can do no wrong, and obvious OOC stuff like that (at least, without good reason). However though, I have some trouble trying to mimic their speech patterns and similar stuff involving words coming out of their mouths.<br>Anyway, enough blabbing about this, so thank you all.</p>

            <p>Sorry if I&#39;m posting this here (Doesn&#39;t want to bury topics), but I have some questions...<br><br>1. Where can I post my writing samples and other types of writing?<br><br>2. I know that I need to wait a month until I am able to ask for permission, but is it okay if I can think about what my agents will be like until then?<br><br>3. Like I said, I have trouble keeping the characters in-character as much as possible, so if I accidently get the characters, say, Harry Potter OOC, can somebody look this over?</p>

            <p>I was gonna have her just be an ordinary girl, but a water mage doesn&#39;t sound too bad either. (But I wonder which continua could water mages possibly be from, though, because I don&#39;t know any series that have them...) (At least, the kind that I have in mind, which would have them wear robes and a silly hat (AKA a blue witches hat) that can be worn over casual clothing, and maybe that staff that you&#39;ve previously mentioned.)</p>

            <p>You here a sound. It was faint at first, just at the edge of one&#39;s hearing, but as the wind kicked up, the sound came in clearer, louder: a screeching, grinding wail, rhythmically pulsing like the beat of a human heart. A light appeared, shimmering in time, and with every pulse grew brighter. Then, with a clunk and a whir, a large blur police box solidified, the wail petering off into a gentle sub-sonic hum. The Door on the side of the police box opens and a tall thin man pops out.<br><br>&quot;Hello, I&#39;m the Doctor.&quot; To the uneducated observer, the tall thin man looked like some kind of crazed old-fashioned professor, with his tweed jacket and suspenders and bow-tie, but he was too young to be a professor, his hair hair coiffed in some kind of pompadour. His eyes gave away what he was. Eyes that had seen empires rise and fall, galaxies come into being, stars being born. Eyes that had seen everything, eyes that were looking confused.<br><br>&quot;Oh, I am terribly sorry sir, I seem to have wandered into here by mistake. Here, have a bag of jelly beans and I&#39;ll be going.&quot; And with those words the man popped back into his box and, in a method similar to its arrival only reversed, the police box vanishes. And as the last waves of sound fade a blond man in a black duster comes around a corner an walks up to you with a black backpack in hand.<br><br>&quot;Here, catch.&quot; He says, tossing you the bag. &quot;It&#39;s a bag of holding containing two generic guns, two generic swords, 4 generic knives, and 13 shuriken. Have fun and try not to maim anyone.&quot; and with that he walks off.</p>

            <p>I have been wondering whatever happened to Trent. His rescue mission is one of the only A-Team missions I have read. It is cool that he is now going to get some screen time.<br><br>It definitely seems like Allison and Tasmin needed a break from each other. I loved their last one, but they were heading for a big fight, I think. I had never thought about disguising as a canon character. That was a good idea.</p>

            <p>It was a few years ago when I thought A-Team badfic was drying up. So I moved Tasmin too Torchwood fic. Then I discovered another source of A-Team badfic and had to think of a reason Tasmin could be in two places at once. A freak time traveling accident. I never wrote that story as it would come at the end  of any missions in A-Team series.<br><br>From the looks of it, I will now just be dealing with three agent pairs who have backstories that lie in my writing future.</p>

            <p>Though, I don&#39;t think I broke a rule. Allison quite clearly pointed out that Face was not going to believe them if they appeared to him as two people he had never met. If there was a rule about disguises, it was required to be broken here. (Although the agents could have gone in disguised as generic MPs, chased away Face and have the mission finished in under 100 words. But that wouldn&#39;t have been much of a story.)</p>

            <p>I was wondering when you&#39;d end up doing missions to filmverse <i>A-Team</i>. What an odd Sue that was, though. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever seen one that blatantly going the superhero route, either. O.o<br><br>I like Trent. He seems a much more upbeat sort of person than Allison, which is good for contrast. I&#39;m not entirely clear on why he talked like that when he tackled the Sue, though. I figure it&#39;s Suefluence of some sort, but why?<br><br>I also like the previous one, but don&#39;t get too set on disguising as canon characters. From TOS #14:<br><blockquote>&quot;Let&#39;s be Ents... or, or, or... or Maiar. Or Melkor! I can be Melkor, and you can be mini-Melkor. Or you can be Melkor and I can be Sauron. Or Ungoliant and Shelob!&quot;<br><br>&quot;I don&#39;t think we can <b>be</b> specific, named characters, Jay.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Phoo.&quot; Jay slumped.</blockquote>
<br>So, that&#39;s probably why it hasn&#39;t been explored more. Like most rules set by HQ, though, breaking it just once for fun isn&#39;t a lynching offense (especially since you carried it off well). Of course, the agents might hear about it later on... {= )<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>A-Team movie fic is for a large part slash, which isn&#39;t my thing. But there are a few Suefics around too. <br><br>Can&#39;t quite explain why Trent started talking differently. He&#39;s very susceptible to the way other people talk. When Allison and Tasmin first encountered him the boy barely spoke English. Half an hour in the company of Tasmin and most grammatical errors were ironed out of his speech pattern. But no one in the fic spoke like that. Perhaps it was a reflex: his brain was battling Suefluence by fighting the symptoms cause by a previous Sue&#39;s influence.<br><br>From your quote I don&#39;t necessarily derive that it is against the rules to disguise as a canon character. It could also be that the disguise generator can&#39;t handle requests that are that specific. Many years of technological development later... <br><br>Still, disguising as canon characters is only fun once in a while. Most of the time it would just draw attention to the agents because the Sue would see the canon character and the disguised agent. Even Sues with half a brain would find that suspicious.</p>

            <p>As a counterpoint to the technological development explanation, it&#39;s only been eight years since Jay and Acacia quit, only six of which have contained Makes-Things, who, in my head-canon, would&#39;ve been too busy keeping the current technology working to improve on systems that already worked just fine.<br><br>Either way, though, to me it&#39;s one of those &quot;just because you can doesn&#39;t mean you should&quot; scenarios. Like you said, it would get old pretty quickly if everybody started doing it, and most of the time it wouldn&#39;t serve the agents well anyhow. It&#39;s safest to assume that the agents can&#39;t be specific, named characters because it&#39;s usually a bad idea, whether they are capable of doing it or not.<br><br>But, like I said, the occasional exception is no big deal if it&#39;s done well. {= )<br><br>From you description, it sounds like Trent is allergic to Suefluence, but instead of breaking out in a rash, his speech patterns change. That would be interesting to watch. Maybe he can act like a canary in a mineshaft, warning his fellow agents when the atmosphere becomes too glittery for safety. ^_^<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>First up, here&#39;s something all you over-squicked Bad Slashers might like. It&#39;s an intentional badfic called<br><br><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080731185420rn_1/www.englishchick.com/badfic/"> Elementary Biology </a><br><br>Warning: may take a while to load.<br><br>---<br><br>Next up, a piece of original fiction by Ben &#39;Yahtzee&#39; Croshaw, called<br><br><a href="http://www.fullyramblomatic.com/articulatejim.htm"> Articulate Jim: A Search for Something </a><br><br>It may be my personal tastes talking, but how could you not love something that offers stuff like this?<br><br>&quot;&#39;Don&#39;t breathe a word of this to anyone,&#39; she said warningly. &#39;This toilet seat is known only to us six. Myself, Horatio Scarlet, Penfold Lexington, Jam Lexington, Camp Gareth and Articulate Jim, whose real name is far too stupid for everyday use. From now on we will use the notes on this toilet seat and Gareth&#39;s arse to seek out the legendary Lost Golden City of El Dorado. From this day forth, we six shall be known as... The Fellowship of the Rim.&#39;<br><br>Dramatic pause.<br><br>&#39;That is so gay,&#39; said Jam.&quot;<br><br>Or this:<br><br>&quot;As for the woman herself, well, she was of course staggeringly beautiful to the degree that made one&#39;s eyes hurt. She was about five foot nine in height with bounteous quantities of blonde flowing hair. Physically perfect in every detail but one - her nose. It had clearly been, of course, perfect, but was now visibly slightly squashed. Rose&#39;s blows could be terrible ones, that I know well, and there&#39;s clearly only so much that the finest plastic surgeons money can buy can do.&quot;<br><br>Or this:<br><br>&quot;Every evening just after dinner Scar and I would meet in the cargo holds and get ourselves completely rat-arsed. The fun part was that it felt like the first time every time; we usually became so blitzed we forgot the entire event.&quot;<br><br>Or, finally, this:<br><br>&quot;Allow me to offer a little explanation here. Scar had spent a lifetime on pirate ships where grog and other beverages flowed like saliva from the mouth of a hungry dog in front of a pie shop. His liver had had an ultimatum - get used to it, or pack in. Fortunately for him it had chosen the former, but now if he went without alcohol for too long his highly evolved metabolism started to collapse, and he would often take drastic measures. When called upon Scar had a MacGyver-like ability to construct a still from virtually any resources, and had on more than one occasion resorted to concocting a brew fermented from human bone marrow.<br><br>So you can see how Rose and Gareth would be a little ill at ease on a ship containing Scar and a notable lack of intoxicating fluid.&quot;<br><br>Everyone likes a good couple of laughs, no? ;)</p>

            <p>You lost me at &quot;disguises are for losers.&quot; If it was meant to be a joke, you missed the mark.<br><br>To be frank, I wasn&#39;t terribly enchanted with the agents to begin with. I grant you that &quot;humorless&quot; can be funny, but I&#39;m not seeing it in the writing sample; also, even the possible humor value of trying to get a large man into Stormtrooper getup was circumvented in a boring and deus-ex-machina-esque way. Anyway, how is a sixty-year-old man going to keep up with sixteen-year-old super-powered Sues and cope with the systemically taxing effects of badfic? Him having the mental age of a ten-year-old does not make it better; rather, it&#39;s kind of offensive. A special needs person does not a good agent make.<br><br>I just don&#39;t see their stories being very fun to read as it is, nor in keeping with the spirit of the PPC. Please give it some extensive thought and try again later.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Just made a short visit to your profile on Ffnet. Like your statement on Steven Moffat. Gave me the giggles. Still does. First time I read it, it was posted by someone who didn&#39;t agree. That gave me even more giggles.<br><br>Other statements like that that made me laugh are those by fans who after CoE said they wanted Steven Moffat to have written the third series of Torchwood. I&#39;ve been saying Moffat should write Torchwood since series one of Torchwood. Because I wanted a story like CoE. I doubt Moffat would have not killed Ianto. These fans believe he would have kept Ianto alive. I think they are not very familiar with Moffats other work.<br><br>As for protocol: I&#39;d written a few PPC missions before I found the board. I don&#39;t think it has been held against me.</p>

            <p>I was cackling when I found it, hence why it is on my profile on ff.net. I -really- dislike Rose (she was OK with Nine, but she should not have stayed on with Ten)...<br><br>Oh Lord don&#39;t go on about CoE. One of my friends -refuses- to watch Day 4 (I think?) because she&#39;s a massive Ianto fan... Kinda the same reason I didn&#39;t watch End of Time (denial...).

            <p>Yes, that is my strange and useless newbie gift. Treasure it. <br><br>Nice to meet you :)  As the others have said, no worries at all about taking on Sues yourself! We don&#39;t have a monopoly on that; the only thing we&#39;re protective of is the shared world of the PPC - our methods and gadgets and history and so on, which is why we have people ask Permission before they write for us, but by no means are we the only ones. So don&#39;t worry. :)<br><br>And of course, as Baird has said, we don&#39;t just kill Sues - that&#39;s how it started, but we&#39;ve branched out. Anyway, here are The Links, are a collection of articles and other useful URLs that we politely ask every newbie to read, as they really do contain Useful Information. It&#39;s a lot of information, but it should explain everything you need to know about the PPC. <br><br>In relative order of sensible-reading-ness, they are:<br><br>* <a href="http://www.misssandman.com/PPC/story.html">The Original PPC Series</a>, which we assume you&#39;ve already read.<br>* The <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Killed_Badfic">List of Killed Badfic</a>, which will direct you to a large number of non-Original PPC Missions.<br><br><u>The Board:</u><br>* The <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/PPC_Board_Constitution">Board Constitution</a><br>* The <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/FAQ:_The_Board">FAQ: For the Board</a><br><br><u>The Wiki:</u><br>* We have our very own <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/PPC_Wiki">PPC Wiki</a><br>* The very-important-to-read-before-requesting-Permission <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Permission">Permission article</a><br>* Our <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Guide_To_The_PPC">Guide To The PPC</a><br>* The <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Mission_Writing_Guide">Mission Writing Guide</a><br>* The <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Slash-Sporking_Guide">Slash-Sporking Guide</a><br>* The <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/FAQ:_For_Newbies">FAQ: For Newbies</a>.<br>When you are ready to edit the wiki, make sure to read <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Help:Editing#Neshomeh.27s_Editing_Tutorial">Neshomeh&#39;s excellent editing tutorial</a>.<br><br>And finally, but very usefully,<br>* The <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/the_ppc/20306.html">List of Everything PPC</a> <br><br><br>Hope you&#39;re not feeling overwhelmed.

            <p>You wouldn&#39;t offend anyone by not reading all our articles, byut you certainly earn extra points for doing so :)<br><br>Writing PPC missions before getting Permission is frowned upon, yes. In these cases, we ask that people don&#39;t post their missions until after they get Permission. If you see a new badfic, you can certainly claim it and even start writing pre-mission notes (finding charges, et cetera), but please don&#39;t write anything. <br><br>If the things you wrote already are PPC-style only and not PPC missions (as in, not including any original PPC elements, like the portals and disguise generators and Flowers and so on), then you can do whatever you like with them. </p>

            <p>I&#39;m supposing you were contacted because of the discussion we had on the IRC last night. We (then again, I didn&#39;t add much to the conversation...) concluded that PPC-style fics are fanfiction like any other, so we can&#39;t go shooting all non-Boarder, PPC fic writers in the face. However, the outliers should be linked to the Boards since many might not know of them. So you&#39;re not in trouble...yet. *evil laugh*<br><br>Enjoy your stay, and have a multi-purpose pineapple.

            <p>From what I&#39;m hearing, this is EXTREMELY NSFW. It&#39;s an original piece of fiction that is so vile and scandalous that the author was sent to court on charges of obscenity. Mind, he was cleared of said charges, but the whole thing still oozes of do not want. It involves kidnapping, raping, and butchering children. I hope I&#39;m not overreacting, but I really do think that everyone deserves a fair warning before clicking that link. ._.</p>

            <p>I think this may be your best mission yet, Miah!  I especially enjoyed reading the canons after they were rescued from the Suefluence: when Lestrade and Mrs. Hudson were together; and later when they were planning to escape with Holmes, and Lestrade&#39;s behavior gave them away.  I thought the characterizations in those scenes were spot-on.<br><br>I also liked that Unger is beginning to be more assertive and confident in this mission, telling jokes and acting a bit more like Kelok&#39;s partner, rather than sidekick.  It&#39;s a shame they didn&#39;t get to fight any zombies on this mission, but I guess it&#39;s long enough as it is.  They were boring zombies anyway.  (And speaking of zombies, I can&#39;t believe Holmes discovers Watson might have been exposed to the zombie virus, and then proceeds to make out with him!  If a scratch can spread the virus, surely a kiss like that would, too!)<br><br>One section that confused me was when the Agents were rescuing Lestrade and Mrs. Hudson.  I had trouble understanding where the portals were leading, and who was on which side of them.  But like I said, an awesome mission overall, and you&#39;re amazing for being able to sit through that monster!</p>

I said something along the lines of what Kelok said in the mission about nesting flashbacks, and whoever it was said, basically, Are they hatching babies? It might have been Makari or Gen.

            <p>I think their SEP fields helped a lot, but the zombies being second-fiddle certainly helped them not having to push that theory too hard. You know, I just thought about it, and in well over 30,000 words of original fic, during which the entire British island is overrun by zombies, they only had four on-screen encounters with the creatures. Three of those were less than 300 words each.</p>

            <p>I didn&#39;t realize that there were so few zombie encounters in that huge badfic (and those encounters were so short too), which makes me think that the author only put the zombie invasion thing in as an excuse to write about Sherlock and Watson getting it on (Hence the reason of killing off Waston&#39;s wife, because she would most likely get in the way of her husband and Sherlock&#39;s &quot;tru wuv&quot; if she was kept alive).</p>

            <p>Ok, I was wrong. The fic was only 22,500. I was thinking it was 32,500. I had also forgotten the first zombie Watson encountered. In my defense, though, the thing attacked off-screen and the discussion of what it had done was only 183 words.<br><br>In other news, I did not know what pingbacks were, LJ had them automatically turned on, and it notified the author when I posted the story.

            <p>Besides, that still doesn&#39;t change the fact that this was only possibly written for the bad Sherlock/Watson, and the zombies was only second place in importance to the &quot;plot&quot; compared to that illogical pairing.<br><br>Ouch, you&#39;d think that when Suthors see their stories being made fun of, they would throw a fit about it or something similar.

Line two is about fixing characters and bringing them back to normal for them. This includes badslash, bashing, and OOC. Line number three is the simple one, killing Sues. Line four refers to undoing and preventing bad crossovers. I will admit that I have a weakness for crossovers, but that does not stop me from seeing red when I find a bad one. Unfortunately for me, about 95% of all crossovers qualify as bad. Back to the point, line five is is more of less a catch basin for anything I forgot or did not cover in earlier lines.

            <p>Though something funny would be nice, too.  It doesn&#39;t have to be the joke that Sedri suggested.  It could be a line that says something along the lines of &quot;To never take ourselves too seriously&quot; (written in an extremely serious tone, of course, because I think irony is funny).</p>

            <p>I quite like it. One suggestion, though: Given that the PPC is notoriously Not Serious, if I were you I&#39;d put one last line at the very end there that comepletely contradicts all the Seriousness and makes readers laugh. Something like:<br><br><i>* ...carry out these tasks by any and all means at our disposal (provided we have a decent supply of Bleeprin and chocolate).<br>* ...So mote it be (unless we can fool the Flowers).<br>*... (now go away so we can sleep!)<br></i><br><br>I&#39;m not great with this kind of one-line witty humour, but do you see what I mean? The above ideas probably aren&#39;t any good - we still want to make it a pledge, just a pledge in PPC-style rather than that of a bratty child.</p>

            <p>You should have done this as a reply to your original post.  Every new post pushes an old post off the front page, and an even older post off of the board entirely.

He stands at 6’3’’, and has curly brown hair and wears glasses with dark blue frames. When not in uniform, he usually goes around in a plain T-shirt and jeans.<br>Backstory: Griffin is from a well-off family, and attended a private school. Extremely tall and athletic, he made the basketball team almost immediately. His mother is Chinese and taught him how to speak in fluent Chinese. He refuses to curse or use foul language, because his father told him that it was ‘uncouth’  and ‘vulgar’. He fell into HQ via a plot hole in his shower. He was recruited and placed with Charlie in the Department of Mary-Sues, and is usually placed in the position of tasting her experimental recipes.<br><br>Name: Charlie Gal-Or<br>Species: Human<br>Home Continuum: Real World<br>Department: Mary-Sues<br>Skills: Decent at archery (but is very bad at other sports), cooks very well, and can write extremely fast<br>Weapons: Bow and arrows<br>Appearance: In contrast to her partner, Charlie is quite short and stands just below 5 ft. She has cropped dark hair that swings by her chin and freckles across her nose. When not in uniform, she often is found in any random pieces of clothing and an apron, usually experimenting with her cooking.<br><br>The story I&#39;d like to kill: <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5173541/1/"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5173541/1/">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5173541/1/</a></a><br>It&#39;s about an OC called Bianca who somehow gains the affections of both Lelouch and Gino.

            <p>I posted these same links a couple of days ago, but I think they got swamped. I&#39;m reposting them here because you guys would miss out on a lot of laughs otherwise.<br><br>Now then, first up, here&#39;s a site called <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080731185420rn_1/www.englishchick.com/badfic/"> Bad Fanfic, No Biscuit! </a>. On the main page, it says, &quot;The purpose of this website is to show examples of intentionally bad fanfic, also known as BadFic, and to explain what makes them bad.&quot; The stories on this site do just that, and, with one (intentional) exception, they do it hilariously. &#39;Elementary Biology&#39; is my personal favorite. ;)<br><br>---<br><br>Next up, a piece of original fiction by Ben &#39;Yahtzee&#39; Croshaw, called <a href="http://www.fullyramblomatic.com/articulatejim.htm"> Articulate Jim: A Search for Something </a>.<br><br>It may be my personal tastes talking, but how could you not love something that offers stuff like this?<br><br>&quot;&#39;Don&#39;t breathe a word of this to anyone,&#39; she said warningly. &#39;This toilet seat is known only to us six. Myself, Horatio Scarlet, Penfold Lexington, Jam Lexington, Camp Gareth and Articulate Jim, whose real name is far too stupid for everyday use. From now on we will use the notes on this toilet seat and Gareth&#39;s arse to seek out the legendary Lost Golden City of El Dorado. From this day forth, we six shall be known as... The Fellowship of the Rim.&#39;<br><br>Dramatic pause.<br><br>&#39;That is so gay,&#39; said Jam.&quot;<br><br>Or this:<br><br>&quot;As for the woman herself, well, she was of course staggeringly beautiful to the degree that made one&#39;s eyes hurt. She was about five foot nine in height with bounteous quantities of blonde flowing hair. Physically perfect in every detail but one - her nose. It had clearly been, of course, perfect, but was now visibly slightly squashed. Rose&#39;s blows could be terrible ones, that I know well, and there&#39;s clearly only so much that the finest plastic surgeons money can buy can do.&quot;<br><br>Or this:<br><br>&quot;Every evening just after dinner Scar and I would meet in the cargo holds and get ourselves completely rat-arsed. The fun part was that it felt like the first time every time; we usually became so blitzed we forgot the entire event.&quot;<br><br>Or, finally, this:<br><br>&quot;Allow me to offer a little explanation here. Scar had spent a lifetime on pirate ships where grog and other beverages flowed like saliva from the mouth of a hungry dog in front of a pie shop. His liver had had an ultimatum - get used to it, or pack in. Fortunately for him it had chosen the former, but now if he went without alcohol for too long his highly evolved metabolism started to collapse, and he would often take drastic measures. When called upon Scar had a MacGyver-like ability to construct a still from virtually any resources, and had on more than one occasion resorted to concocting a brew fermented from human bone marrow.<br><br>So you can see how Rose and Gareth would be a little ill at ease on a ship containing Scar and a notable lack of intoxicating fluid.&quot;<br><br>Everyone likes a good couple of laughs, no? ;)</p>

            <p>PPC agent&#39;s goal #1: Restore continuum to original status.<br>PPC agent&#39;s goal #2: Get back at the badfic for the insanity suffered.<br><br>Luckily, the two goals fit together nicely because irony, like any law of narrative comedy, tends to play itself out very often in PPC missions; and one very classic kind of irony is when a bad guy is killed in an ironic fashion--in this case, killed by the continuum he was trying to distort. We&#39;re talking Sues here, for the most part (some other phenomena may also be subject to this, such as mini-Sues, author-wraiths, badfic authors at OFUs, uncanonical locations, and misbehaving PPC agents).<br><br>It&#39;s generally thought that the more canonical and &quot;fitting&quot; the punishment is, the better the canon can recover from the Sue&#39;s damage. For example, a witch!Sue in a Harry Potter fic often ends up burned with the Incendio charm--doubly ironic, because she&#39;s being targeted by Potterverse magic (a canonical method of demise--highly preferred) and is being &quot;burned as a witch&quot;!<br><br>But that&#39;s not the only thing that has to be taken into account. Not only does an execution have to be fittingly ironic; it also can&#39;t get too old. The less cliched an execution strategy is, the better it seems to work. Witch-burning, in this case, has unfortunately been used quite a few times. Other examples include feeding Sues to the Balrog or the Watcher in the Water. The more unusual, the less often an execution method can be repeated and retain its efficacy. The businesslike executions favored by assassins who prefer to just &quot;get the job done&quot; without any extra frills (bullets, arrows, knives, etc.) don&#39;t seem to suffer at all from the problem of being cliched, no matter how often they are used.<br><br>I should, however, note that it&#39;s important not to be *too* elaborate with executions. Canonical and ironic, or else businesslike and quick, tend to be the best ways to go about the execution. Torture is absolutely forbidden, though it has happened in the past, because it&#39;s generally a bad idea to generate any kind of sympathy for the Sue, and torture often has that result. (It&#39;s also ethically a bad idea; the Sue may have no more sentience than the average insect, but just as it&#39;s distasteful to pull the wings off flies, it&#39;s distasteful to torture a Sue, and probably worse in the long run because Sues often mimic humans to such a high degree.) Forced retirement or even decommissioning usually happen, eventually, to assassins who lose perspective and begin to operate under the assumption that they are there to punish Sues rather than protect the multiverse.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m not so sure all of those should be counted as irony, per se. A Potterverse Sue can be killed with a Potterverse spell simply because it&#39;s the easiest method of execution that doesn&#39;t warp canon further - ironic would be if the Sue had invented a ridiculous new spell and <i>that</i> was used ti kill her. That would be something unusual for agents, too. Regardless, I don&#39;t think any of this would necessarily qualify as &quot;cool&quot; or &quot;unusual&quot;. But maybe I&#39;m just being too blasé. </p>

            <p>All I was saying there is that using the canonical tools of whatever universe you&#39;re in to kill a Sue is standard proceedure (in order to keep from warping canon further), and almost certainly doesn&#39;t qualify as &quot;cool&quot; or &quot;unusual&quot;. What <i>does</i> qualify is certainly going to be a matter of opinion regardless, so... well, yes, it depends on what your agent would find most ironic and satisfying (without breaking The Rules, of course). </p>

            <p>How an assassin handles a Sue definitely reflects the assassin&#39;s personality. &quot;Burn the witch&quot; is not particularly good the fourth time around because it&#39;s become too generic to be truly ironic anymore. Many assassins have trademark weapons or execution strategies; others like to get creative with whatever the canon offers. When it comes to assassination style and strategy, a Federation security officer recruited from a &quot;Star Trek&quot; badfic is going to be very different from a sixteen-year-old OFUM graduate or a Middle-Earth mpreg baby who grew up in the Nursery...<br><br>Personally, I think that if it&#39;s not creative or original, then you&#39;re better off just shooting the Sue. Making fun of the badfic is the real meat of a DMS mission anyway; the execution itself doesn&#39;t generally take more than a paragraph to describe.</p>

            <p><u>The Thoughtful Answer</u><br><br>Think of the canonical universe as the two faces and the alternative universe as the vase. All it takes to go from one to the other is a change in perspective, which is provided by the fic author. Good AUs make the illusion work, whereas poor AUs give you headaches. The DIAU agent&#39;s job is to cull out the weak realities (badfics) and leave the strong ones (goodfics) be.<br><br><u>The Not-So-Thoughtful Answer</u><br><br>It represents the same thing as a cactus does for the Department of Mary Sues.</p>

            <p>If you want a simple image, two lightning bolts--for the phrase &quot;lightning strikes twice in the same place&quot;, meaning an extremely unlikely event.

            <p>I&#39;m curious: When you write your missions, do you write them as taking place one directly after another, or do you allow room for something else to happen in between if you so choose? <br><br>I ask because it&#39;s been months - maybe a whole year - since I&#39;ve written for Agent Sedri, and events that have a date stamp (the 2008 Mary Sue invasion, or when Iza was reassigned in January last year) don&#39;t match up with the narrative of my missions. Of course, I could simply blame it on the unstable nature of time in HQ, but I&#39;m thinking that I&#39;d rather make some unspecific comments about how Sedri has been doing other missions in between, perhaps leaving room to write missions set during that time at a later date.<br><br>There&#39;s no right or wrong, I&#39;m sure, but I&#39;m curious; how do all of you do it?</p>

            <p>...but there is a definite breaking point for my characters - causing them to miss the 2008 Invasion - and so I&#39;m trying to do missions from before then so I can at least have a history for them before all hell breaks loose.

            <p>Pads and I tended to write missions in chronological order :) It&#39;s easier to develop character that way, I find. Although that&#39;s not to say we never skipped ahead for various reasons, usually because a badfic was really tempting or because some event was happening that we wanted to participate in, in say, March, but our Agent timeline wasn&#39;t yet past January.</p>

            <p>That is, I have never mentioned at what time a mission took place or related it to invasions and other big events that took place at HQ. I don&#39;t write missions in chronological order. Sometimes an earlier mission comes after a later written one. I pretend that the order in which I post missions on lj is chronological.<br><br>If you were to look at original posting dates of missions. you&#39;d find that in 2006 Trent was 10 and now, in 2010, he is 16. I was actually rather surprised to find that time in HQ is linear. The floor plan isn&#39;t. In my head, it&#39;s as difficult to get from one point in time to another at HQ, as it is to get from one place in the building to another.</p>

            <p>My feeling is that time in HQ is relative to who you&#39;re talking to. The agents <i>perceive</i> it as linear because it&#39;s what they&#39;re used to, therefore missions happen one after the other, but because it actually isn&#39;t, Mission 1 can happen on Wednesday and Mission 2 can then happen the previous Monday. Years can go by in the span of a month if need be for basically the same reason. It&#39;s all due to plotholes/portal technology, not to mention the time spent in missions (which sometimes is like Narnia time, but sometimes isn&#39;t). I know Jay remarks at some point that if time worked normally, all the time spent in missions would mean that she was really old. But clearly that was not the case for her.<br><br>In my latest FicPsych story, I mention that the nurses are free to set their clocks however they like as long as they&#39;re on duty when they&#39;re supposed to be. It can be noon for you and 7:00 a.m. for the next person easily, depending on whether you&#39;re a morning person or not.<br><br>We didn&#39;t really start keeping track of &quot;HQ time&quot; until just a few years ago, and that was due to big events like Crashing Down and all the 2008 stuff. Aside from those things, and maybe noting what year it is, I don&#39;t think there&#39;s really any reason to bother with time except to say &quot;this came first, this came second, this came a long time after the first thing,&quot; etc.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>It depends for me. Miah and Cali missions tend to have unspecified time between them, but so far Kelok and Unger have been nearly continuous, with the beginning of one story beginning from them stepping through the portal from their last mission, or at least with it being specified that no missions happened in the missing time. Now that I have their introductory story arc done, I might space them out more.</p>

            <p>Since it&#39;s been agreed on that missions are generally close together, it&#39;d be kind of impossibly to write out each and every one of them. If that was the case, then it would take a year to write the missions they do in a week. If I do make references to these unwritten missions, I&#39;ll do it in the form of a Noodle Incident.</p>

            <p>Well, for me (at the moment anyways), I basically started out my missions in late 2009 HST, but beyond that, the timeline&#39;s a bit up in the air.

            <p>My first few missions were written before we started keeping track of the actual passage of time, so they flow together without bothering much about any time or lack thereof in-between. That changed when I caught up to the events of 2008: it pinpointed my agents on a specific timeline, and I had to take that into account when I paired them up with Barid&#39;s agents. Therefore, over a year passed for them between the end of Ilraen&#39;s journal-interlude and that double-mission.<br><br>So basically, unless something specifically relative to something else happens in a story, I&#39;m not too worried about how much time passes between one and the next.

            <p>I know I only have two missions out at the moment, but I like to have them one right after the other.  It helps me to keep the narrative flow of the characters&#39; stories.

            <p>To have a Sue that doesn&#39;t effect the canon? I think so, because you they could simply live in that multiverse, but also have Sue-ish traits.

            <p>I think so.  If you had a Sue that was entirely in another part of the world, not interacting with the canon, it would be possible.  For instance, a Harry Potter Sue who was in a school in, say, South America who was perfect, talented, angsty, beautiful, and had all the boys falling over her, but didn&#39;t break any established rules of how wizardry works, would still be a Sue but not touch canon.<br><br>Why a Suethor would come up with this I can&#39;t imagine.</p>

            <p>I used to do similar stuff, when I was young and very silly. I&#39;d put my OCs, some of whom were definitely Sues, into situations in the canon where they didn&#39;t touch the main characters--into the future or the past, or in a different location. I think I did this because whenever I like a story, it tends to be very much because I like the world itself, not necessarily the characters (though those have to be at least decent for me to like the story in general). Putting my OCs into situations where the main characters had little more than cameos let me &quot;tour&quot; that world without getting swept up in the main plot. It was very much wish-fulfillment, and as I&#39;ve said before, I did end up with blatant Sues. Actually, I need to see if I can dig up some of my old stories; they might be worth PPCing.</p>

            <p>A Canon Sue is a sue that doesn&#39;t damage the continuum.

            <p>I don&#39;t really think it&#39;s situation that makes the Sue, it&#39;s attitude. So, as long as the Tenth Walker is mildly low-key and believable, and non-Sueish, they wouldn&#39;t really be a Sue.</p>

            <p>I don&#39;t think these are n00bish questions.  I think it is important to ask questions like these.<br><br>I think you will find that, even among our community, what it takes to call a character a Sue varies.  Some believe that if the character has Sue-ish traits then, whether they warp Canon or not, they are Sues.  Others believe that Sue-ish traits are not as important as the Canon warping.<br><br>I personally believe that If it looks like a duck (Rainbow-colored duck in this case), sounds like a duck (musical quacking?), and smells like a duck (cookies...maybe)then it is a duck.  This is why I believe the terms like Canon-Sue are not a bad thing.  It is simply defining a character by the characteristics that they share with a specific group.<br><br>We don&#39;t mind ducks, usually.  The issue comes when you find a duck in the desert (a canon where it does not belong).  A duck in a desert is out of place, where a duck in a pond is right where it should be so we don&#39;t mind that it is a duck.<br><br>Your second question is also interesting.  To use the same metaphor, if you are looking at an animal that doesn&#39;t have feathers, a bill, or webbed feet, it probably isn&#39;t a duck.  That does not meant that if you put it in a desert (or even a pond) it isn&#39;t going to be out of place.  It is possible for even non-Sues to warp canon.<br><br>So, if that made any sense then I am glad.  If not, I will try to clarify it.<br><br>-Barid</p>

            <p>To the former, I think not, mostly on a matter of definition - if an original character meets the criteria to be called a Sue, they pretty much have to affect the canon (and, the spelling is &quot;affect&quot; in this situation; just so you know). On the other hand, an original character who has a few potentially Sueish traits but isn&#39;t an actual Sue themselves wouldn&#39;t necessarily affect the canon - well, technically, any OC affects canon because they&#39;re not supposed to be there, but they could have an extremely minimal presence. <br><br>To the latter: If so, I would <i>love</i> to see it. <br>I highly doubt it. However, there are some exceptionally good OCs around, and even the most Sueish storyline could, possibly (in some cases <i>extremely remotely</i>), be wrangled into a good story by a writer who very, very, very skilled. Actually, I did once read a fic about a human girl - whom the author deliberately made as her avatar - who fell into Middle-earth, fell in love with Frodo, and married him, and it was well written. She wasn&#39;t a Tenth Walker, but she did manage to evade most of the cliche pitfalls. So yes, I&#39;d say it&#39;s possible, but the chances of finding or being able to write one are probably something like two million to one. <br><br>All questions are good questions :) </p>

            <p>If you&#39;re talking about user pages (e.g. User:Neshomeh), you get that when you sign up for an account on Wikia.<br><br>When an article has something at the front with a colon like that, it&#39;s called a namespace. User pages go in the User namespace, and the only way to get that is to make an account. Images (e.g. File:Imagename.gif) are in the File namespace, which you only get when you upload an image. You can get other namespaces by naming them that way when you make the page (e.g. FAQ:For Other People).<br><br>I&#39;m guessing that isn&#39;t what you&#39;re talking about, though. For editing help, I suggest starting with the <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Help:Editing">Help:Editing</a> page (which, as you may have noticed now, is in the Help namespace).<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>So this is an idea that popped into my brain and I&#39;ve discussed a couple of times on the IRC. <br><br>A support group for Agents recruited out of Badfic. Basically, a place to go talk about how well they&#39;ve been doing at being good, solid characters with realistic characterization and personality, and get help with relapses. <br><br>I&#39;m currently working on a new Agent Pair, both of whom are Badfic Recruits, and am going to be sending them to weekly meetings. <br><br>So if you&#39;ve got an Agent or two who fits the bill, and would like them to get a mention, make note? Otherwise it&#39;ll just have to be a bunch of random folks. </p>

            <p>Derik can be either dark and broody or affable and pleasant, though reserved. If the former, he&#39;s unlikely to talk much, but rather sit with his arms folded and just glower at everyone. He might be convinced to mutter something about how Sues are a parasite and need to be flamed out of the skies, and he might scoff at people who are queasy about killing. In better headspace, he still feels the same way about Sues, but he&#39;ll admit to being worried by those dark fits, and he would apologize for anything mean he might have said in previous meetings. He suspects that having been based on the Phantom of the Opera is responsible, and he might joke about needing to be packed off to FicPsych, pronto, if he ever starts talking in the third person.<br><br>Whether Ilraen is actually nominated to lead a meeting or not, he&#39;ll naturally fall to keeping order if necessary. He&#39;s generally friendly and will try to get along with everyone. He might inquire after Sedri to Iza, assuming he knows that they were partners--Sedri helped out on one of his and Nume&#39;s missions. His biggest concern these days is self-confidence. He&#39;s been doing his job long enough to feel like he ought to know what he&#39;s doing, but his latest big mistake has shaken him. He also worries about his partner, who still seems strange and unreachable even three years on, and is hitting the Bleepka more heavily than usual lately. Despite having been reassured that Nume is just like that, he is afraid that it&#39;s something about himself keeping Nume from confiding in him.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>If you use Iza (and I do suggest you ask Trojie first, since she&#39;s going to have to incorporate it into whatever mission she writes for Iza next), she can have been forced to kill a bit character again - she was moved back into Bad Slash because she couldn&#39;t handle murder, and gets queasy and very upset every time. The other option is to have her be having trouble with her own lack of personal history, but that&#39;s very complicated for a cameo appearance.</p>

Or he&#39;ll be bouncing off the walls (literally) while Caleb tries to keep him from pouncing on people.</p>

            <p>I think that this will be very helpful to the agents that came from badfic, so again, splendid...just splendid. After all, personalities are very good to have, and it can humanize (or at least, make people much more personalized) people as well.</p>

            <p>Let&#39;s see... <br><br>Well, there&#39;s certainly Agent Iza, a Bajoran from the Trekverse who was recruited from a badslash fic but had absolutely no personality, meaning that she&#39;s in the process of figuring out who she is. Aside from very random mood swings, she tends to be very energetic and optimistic and exhausting to be around. However, I handed her over to Trojie (and Pads) a while ago, so you should probably ask her, but I see no reason why Iza wouldn&#39;t go do such a meeting. She&#39;d probably end up running the place with a big grin on her face.<br><br>I&#39;m also in the process of making a new agent, Agent Ketay, a Cardassian woman (also Trekverse). She probably wouldn&#39;t be interested in such a support group, though; she keeps too much to herself and is actually pretty stable for a recruit. If you like, feel free to mention her as having <i>not</i> come - maybe if you have someone taking a roll call or just asks someone whether they know if Ketay&#39;s coming. <br><br>Other than that, the only agent I&#39;ve created is Sedri, and she&#39;s from the real world. Sorry.<br><br><br>That said, this sounds like a great deal of fun! I can&#39;t wait to read it. :D</p>

            <p>Agent Kestrel was rescued from badfic, but she was a background character who never made an appearance, so I&#39;m not sure if she&#39;d count.<br><br>Two agents I haven&#39;t officially introduced yet would also qualify. Agent Jack is a Hunter from the Left 4 Dead universe, rendered sapient by accident in a badfic. He&#39;s completely blind, but gets around with smell and hearing.

            <p>Jane is from Middle-Earth. She&#39;s a Random Dwarf who was saved from a dragon by a Mary Sue. Because the badfic writer never mentioned it, Jane intermittently does and does not have a beard, and when she does have one, it tends to change in shape and style. She&#39;s total Generic Dwarf--brown hair, brown eyes, short, stocky. At this point she&#39;s been in the PPC for about a month, and the big technology gap is both confusing and fascinating to her. As a result she&#39;s constantly researching both the continua and the basics of science. May be seen carrying around all kinds of books, including everything from the complete Harry Potter series to sophisticated tomes like &quot;A Child&#39;s First Book of Electricity&quot;. Still uses a universal translator but can speak some English, though it&#39;s heavily accented. Her personality has begun to show itself as inquisitive, hard-working, and orderly. She speaks (through the translator) in a somewhat formal manner, loves coffee, and carries a set of three throwing axes on a belt. She has read the PPC handbook cover-to-cover and still sometimes forgets that always going by the book can be a Bad Idea.<br><br>She picked the name &quot;Jane Doe&quot; because when she was dragged into FicPsych by a couple of agents who found her, she was heavily tranquilized and woke up to hear a nurse calling her by that name. She subsequently adopted it because it worked as well as any other.<br><br>Jane is in the Floaters department, partnered with a former PPC janitor named Jason. She would probably be attending the meeting because she is trying to figure out how the multiverse works and gathering all the information she can possibly get her hands on.</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve a couple of Agents who might be interested. It&#39;d be a difference to their usual FicPsych stuff.<br><br>The first is Alyssa Tyniova, and her daemon Kian. They were recruited from the His Dark Materials-verse back in 2008.

            <p>You can always save the fic and put it on the Claimed Badfic list until you have Permission (if you have it already and my memory is just being fail-y, ignore that comment). But I don&#39;t think there&#39;d be a problem with a Pokemon Sue being tackled, any more than any other Sue. Besides, fics that provoke spit-takes are generally quite PPC-able.<br><br>(On another note altogether, what&#39;s your Agent Cassie like?

            <p>It was reasonable up till the point when I read about the girl being 15 and a &quot;retired&quot; Champion, as well as having a Vaporeon which knew Hydro Cannon (a move limited to Water type starters) and an Eevee which could beat an Elite Four&#39;s Rapidash with Dig and Shadow Ball (the rest of the team was Espeon, Beautifly, Gardevoir and Ninetales-- two Psychics, a Bug, Water, Fire and Normal doth NOT a balanced team make). That induced the spit take. That was one, and the other one which I noted was from a different fic and the traditional &quot;cold and mysterious beauty&quot; sort. <br><br>My Agent Cassie is Chinese, somewhat pyromaniacal and a little sadistic, has a fondness for most animals (except bees and Pug dogs), knows way too much about biology and the British legal system, collects panpipes and random shiny objects, registered Lust Objects so far Aragorn and Hitsugaya Toushirou... and has a mild fear of large crowds.</p>

            <p>1) A mini- question: In Potterverse the established mini- is mini-acromantula. Since I am arachnofobic and plan to make my agent even more so, I was wondering, could I possibly change the mini-creature in my missions and have mini-thestrals instead? On the whole I think they would be much cuter than a spider...<br><br>2) Continuum question: If there is something wrong in the original continuum (like non-military military in SG), should we stick to that standard or should the agents &quot;fix&quot; even that while in the continuum (eg. if a Sue is insubordinate, which is quite a normal trait in SG characters, should it go to the charge list)?<br><br>3) Implausible Crossovers question: If there is a crossover between a continuum where fanfic is allowed by the original author and one where it isn&#39;t (and that crossover is a badfic) should we leave it alone or can we send agents to untangle it, provided we leave the &quot;non-fanfic continuum&quot; more or less alone?<br><br>Maybe there are answers to those questions somewhere, but I didn&#39;t find them, so I would appreciate any and all help you can give me ;-) </p>

            <p>As far as I know, once a mini has been set, it cannot be changed, and the first person to write a mission in that continuum is the one to set it.<br><br>I would still charge a Sue with being insubordinate, because even though Jack, in particular, gets away with insubordination, the rest of the personnel on the base does not. Daniel is mouthy all the time, but he is not military. Carter is not nearly as mouthy as Jack to higher ranks. I would consider a Sue getting away with it as an indicator of sheshulness.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m more familiar with SGA than with SG-1, having only seen the odd episode of the latter. Haven&#39;t noticed much insubordination, but that&#39;s probably because the military presence in SGA is less strong: in the first three seasons only one main character was military. He usually ended up having arguments with people who were not subordinate to him in the first place, and therefor could not be insubordinate.<br><br>Sues that claimed to have a military background (along with their scientific background, as do the characters from SG, but not the characters from SGA) were charged with insubordinace when they were. For instance, when showing up late for a meeting because of a bet or when a captain argued with Shepard that he gave her a small gun when giving everyone else a P90. Other military characters (or scientists for that matter) wouldn&#39;t have gotten away with that kind of behaviour, and thus neither should the Sue.<br><br>That&#39;s what we do: point out that the Sue is getting away with behaviour that the characters would not let others get away with.<br><br>As for fixing things that are wrong on the show: it has annoyed me to no end that Carson Beckett had a Scottish flag on his sleeve, while all the other personnel from the UK had the union flag on their sleeve. When my agents first did a mission in SGA I drew attention to that point by giving one of my agents the flag of England on her sleeve and have her argue against that.</p>

            <p>The SGverse has problems in every military aspect you can think of - starting with mentioned insubordination (most pronounced in SG-1) continuing through trigger discipline (don&#39;t get me started on that - eventhough there was a good story about Joe Flannigan(Sheppard) annoying the hell out of producers by wasting expensive ammo ;-)) and ending in the teams&#39; absolute incompetence in taking cover (not even mentioning the jaffa tactics of &quot;rolling over the hill and letting ourselves get killed by thousands&quot;).<br><br>However I didn&#39;t think only about the SG, that was just an example. I was thinking more along the lines &quot;what if I know something is wrong, but the original author wrote it that way&quot; (eg. being from Czech Republic, I know some authors would put my inland country to the seaside or make other geographical aberations). <br><br>I like the idea of the English flag or some other subtle way to solve it ;-)</p>

<li>Your agent is an arachnophobe, and you&#39;re even <i>thinking</i> of not taking advantage of the possible hilarity?! No! Don&#39;t change the mini! Of course, your agent doesn&#39;t have to adopt one, nor do you have to describe the mini anywhere past &quot;a Mini-Aragog&quot;, nor do you even have to state that a mini has been generated... but this is potentially a cool thing. Your agent has to face her fears--does she turn into a little quivering ball, does she get violent and take it out on the badfic, does she hide behind her partner, does she eventually figure out that, &quot;Yeah, I hate the creepy little things, but there are worse things in the world&quot;? You have an opportunity for character development here. Don&#39;t waste it! (Also don&#39;t magically cure the phobia the first time she sees a mini-Aragog. That&#39;s just cheap.)<br><br>2. Each continuum has its own rules. If insubordination is relatively normal in that continuum, it&#39;s not a charge. Similarly, having unusually colored hair in many anime continua wouldn&#39;t be a Sue trait, because so many characters do. But if it&#39;s over-the-top for the Sue&#39;s position or the situation, it can still be a charge.<br><br>3. I hadn&#39;t thought of that. The way we have it now with quarantined continua, the characters from the quarantined continuum could only be character replacements, because the author can&#39;t access the true version of the quarantined continuum; so in this case it&#39;s not really an Implausible Crossovers fic at all. The idea of quarantine is there because we need an &quot;excuse&quot; not to PPC stories set in banned worlds (i.e., the author has banned all fanfic, so his continuum doesn&#39;t need protection). I would say that, to preserve that reasoning, the best way to resolve it would probably be, &quot;When a fanfic author attempts to access a quarantined continuum for any reason, he is blocked and must create his own continuum. All characters within this continuum are essentially original characters, though heavily plagiarized.&quot;</li>

            <p>1)You are probably right but I was not thinking about leaving the arachnophobia unexploited...I just really wanted a mini and a mini-thestral would be cool ;-) plus, my reasoning was, that if the continuum tries to protect the agents, it might be possible for it to change the appearance of a mini in order for it to be taken away by the agents...Plus most other minis are just a miniaturized version of a canonical creature which doesn&#39;t have a real life counterpart. Whereas the mini-Aragog is just an big-ass spider...so in a way it yould be fair for the continuum to have a more &quot;unique&quot; mini. Anyway, I&#39;ll make the most of it however it plays out ;-)<br><br>2)OK, thanks for clarification.<br><br>3)I thought about that only because I have found one particular example of badfic - Gary Stu infested Potterverse into which couple of characters from another (quarantined) universe have been pulled to play bits. I would really like to do that as a mission, I just wasn&#39;t sure how.</p>

            <p>...frankly, if the badfic was covering a quarantined continuum, then it probably should not be there at all. If you wanted to list &quot;unauthorized use of a quarantined continuum&quot; as a charge and then untangle the two botched-up stories, then that is one way to do it, but you may need to put up a big ol&#39; disclaimer stating that you meant no harm to the writer or their story. Or, as Callista stated, you could just say it&#39;s a heavily plagiarized alternate continuity.</p>
