            <p>Awesome riffing. And thanks for the limb-dropping reference, I appreciate that :) (Don&#39;t know if you saw mine and PitViper&#39;s latest, but the motif continues in that one.

            <p>It grews more and more over the top as it goes on. The first ten chapeters, maybe fifteen, are not so bad, but then it&#39;s quite a mess. That&#39;s why I want other opinions on it, it can be pretty good or it can be a borderline-badfic. However, I&#39;m quite interested in it since that keyblade-wileding Sakura behaves more like a completely original character, and I&#39;d like to recruit her.<br><br>There&#39;s a still-ongoing sequel in which both Sakura and Carter get MJOLNIR suits. Non-augmented humans are supposed to hurt themselves due to the reaction-enhancing materials not suited for them. And, besides, even the super-lightweight one that gets Sakura must weight more than 100 kilograms (A full Spartan soldier is 450 kilos.). Sakura is a magical girl, yes, but she is actually 12 YEARS OLD. How the hell is she supposed to even being able to lift that thing? (She actually complains that it&#39;s too heavy to fight in, but she can apparently move around quite well)</p>

            <p>Does it ever mention her using the Clow Cards (or the Sakura Cards... which season are we talking about here? Post season?) or the wand or whatnot? Because she could have used the Power Card offscreen. I mean, if that thing could let her lift King Penguin, it should have no problem with a MJOLNIR suit.</p>

            <p>The wand gets fused with a thing she finds in a locker (just afret she finds her old things) and becomes the Keyblade, and after that the cards are never mentioned again. In the sequel, when Arius asks Sakura to better gear up, she says that she never used a gun (right) and however she has the Keyblade, but doesn&#39;t mention the cards. I think it&#39;s implied that she cannot open the book again, since the &quot;storage form&quot; of the wand, no longer avaible, is also the key that opens the Book of Clow.<br><br>It&#39;s implied that is post anime/manga end (There is no way to estabilish waht canon follows), I think. Sakura got attacked by the Insatiate, somehow survived and was transferred to Ever After. She spent years here to regain her memories, but her body didn&#39;t age. (Another charge)<br><br>However, the main problem with the MJOLNIR suit is the device that increases reflexes and strenght. It&#39;s both necessary to use effectively the suit, and unsuitable for normal humans. According to the Halopedia, it would cause broken bones or even death. Sakura&#39;s magic maybe helps, but that is not the case for Samantha Carter. So, we have another charge: Handwaving that, or making the Matorans (Bionicle) build better suits than the UNSC... WITHOUT HAVING EVEN ONLY SEEN THOSE THINGS BEFORE. IMHO, it doesn&#39;t make sense.<br><br>Also, did I say that one of the two baddies introduced is LORD FREAKING VOLDEMORT?</p>

            <p>So, &quot;Lies of Locke Lamora&quot; is a very favourite book of mine. (Almost no fanfic, sadly/mercifully - pick one.) Anyway, several sites have been claiming almost since it came out that WB have the movie rights and the movie will be started next year. However, no amount of searching on my part has been able to confirm or deny this or pick up any further details. Anyone else know anything at all about it?</p>

The entire Touhou cast is also massively OOC, even by that fandom&#39;s standards, and it directly contradicts canon multiple times. On top of that, it has several characters randomly go insane and attack people, and is written entirely in beige prose.The author even gives descriptions of canon characters in said beige prose, which are so general that anyone familiar with the respective canon already knew everything stated.<br><br>The second charged fic:<br><br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6254920/1/From_the_Sky_and_Beyond"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6254920/1/From_the_Sky_and_Beyond">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6254920/1/From_the_Sky_and_Beyond</a></a><br><br>From just the first chapter, I see a  VERY obvious Stu. He can resurrect if killed, is strong enough to kill guys in powered armor(which doesn&#39;t exist in canon) with a few punches, looks 20 while actually being 1500, and various other offenses. Beyond the Stu, the story has either made a canon character look massively older or contains lime-level lolicon, as well as worse than usual fanboy Japanese.<br><br>If anyone decides to do a mission in either of these, its important to note that characters being mildly OOC and/or something being different from canon is acceptable in the Touhou fandom. Major discrepancies are not allowed, but minor changes the author likes tend to become canon. It is also important to realize that Touhou characters tend to make god mode sues look weak. All of the named characters from Harry Potter combined might be able to beat one of the weaker Touhou characters. Any agent attempting to enter the continuity should prepare accordingly.</p>

            <p>According to the descriptions, both are badfic.<br><br>Being some thousand years old is not an heavy offense in the Touhou canon, since a lot of people is much older. (Eirin was probably around 6000-7000 years ago. Yes.) However, if the Stu is an human, it cannot be: humans age just as Real World ones in Touhou.

Then there was this sticky plot point I had to work out towards the end.

That said, he was my favorite character to work with. :)<br><br>By the way, I checked out the rest of your dA gallery. This was mainly to get more info on the characters in the story (Caleb from the 1920s and stuff like that), but I looked at some other stuff too. Love it, especially the Good Omens pictures. Those are so... <i>sweet</i>. <br><br>Afterwards, I went to look at some GO fanfic. It&#39;s truly amazing to see a fandom comprised almost entirely of really good writers. Blew me away. The result, of course, is that I am <i>hooked</i>. I haven&#39;t even read the book yet (ordered it just two days ago), but I already ship those two. And believe me, honey, when I ship, I <i>ship</i>, and I <i>never</i> let my OTPs go. Ever. I get way too attached for that.<br><br>...<br><br>You are <i>scum</i>, you know that, don&#39;t you? ;P<br><br>One evening, I also clicked on a certain link you posted. When I was done reading, I went to the mirror and checked my <i>eyes</i> for spirals. You have permanently ruined my spaghetti experience. I may never forgive you. Would you like links to some more of Ito&#39;s work?<br><br>(By the way, the bunny reference was to &#39;Bunnicula&#39;, a vampire bunny that sucks the juice out of vegetables. I am weird.)<br><br>Sorry if this reply is too long. I&#39;d just thought up so much stuff I wanted to say to you.</p>

            <p>Generally, if no one replies to such requests around here, it&#39;s because no one has the time or the background knowledge to help you out. Your first post hasn&#39;t even fallen off the first page yet; it won&#39;t have died from being unnoticed. Chances are, I&#39;m afraid, that no one is able or ready to help you at this point. <br><br>Also, if I may be blunt, this is a <i>community</i>, and as such, we tend to be more inclined to do favours for each other when we have some familiarity with said people; given that the only threads you&#39;ve taken part in are related to your request, that makes it a little hard for people to get to know you. In fact, I&#39;m still not clear on whether you want to join our community and enjoy the PPC for what it is, whether or not you write missions, or whether you&#39;re just here because you heard that we&#39;re good beta readers. If the former, I would suggest actually taking part in more discussions. If the latter... you&#39;re not likely to get much of a response. Solidarity and all that.<br><br>All that said, I&#39;m afraid I can&#39;t help beta read for you - I&#39;ve never even heard of the fandom, and I&#39;m very busy just now. Sorry.</p>

            <p>Hi everyone! I&#39;ve recently bumped into PPC and I loved this idea of finishing bad wiriting, and I&#39;d love to join here, so I&#39;m introducing myself to The Board. But I have a terrible problem: English isn&#39;t my mother tongue and I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;ll be able to complete a story without help (grammar, spell, punctuation, and so on). So I&#39;ve decided to hang around here, not just as the Constitution claims, but also for myself. Could anyone tell me how it all works? I thank you for any help  </p>

            <p>Hello fellow new person.  Maybe I&#39;ll be able to help with the spelling/grammar/punctuation/whatnot you need help with.  If you write something for the Board and want it reviewed, I can beta-read it.<br><br>Apparently PPC wants you to hang around for a month or so before you can be granted permission, so it&#39;s a good idea to participate in some of the other topics.

            <p>...Hi...<br>It&#39;s been  over a month since I first started posting on the Board, and I&#39;d like to request permission (as the subject line hints at). I posted this eariler, but I didn&#39;t get a response from any of the Permssion Givers, so here it is again.<br>Agents - Travis and Jen. Travis used to work for Team Rocket, and Jen was an Officer Jenny cadet. Both fell into HQ on the same day and wound up as partners, much to their annoyence. Jen is very strict about rules (she sometimes forgets she&#39;s not in a police force) and is easily angered. Travis is generally very hyper and is a huge kleptomaniac. Jen&#39;s very Lawful Good, while Travis is Chaotic Neutral/Evil.<br>I might come up with some more agents later on.<br>Writing sample: <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5782852/1/The_bSockpenguin_b_Adventures"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5782852/1/The_bSockpenguin_b_Adventures">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5782852/1/The_bSockpenguin_b_Adventures</a></a>. This is a Pokémon fanfic with a mostly OC cast. The chapters that are up were reworked recently.<br>Fanfic: I&#39;d like to spork My Inner Life. Yes, that My Inner Life (<a href="http://linksqueen.tripod.com/mil.html"><a href="http://linksqueen.tripod.com/mil.html">http://linksqueen.tripod.com/mil.html</a></a>).

            <p>After talking this over with Makari, I&#39;m going to have to say no.<br><br>Your writing sample seemed lacking; it wasn&#39;t emotionally engaging, and seemed very focused on the logistics of the game, instead of character development. Your character showed potential at first, but I found a lot of her actions towards the Piplup very illogical-- it seemed like you were trying too hard to set up the Pokemon-as-Tools archetypal character, without giving in-story reasoning. With your Agents&#39; descriptions being so vague, it&#39;s hard to approve Permission without knowing that your writing style has improved since that sample to the point where you won&#39;t fall into the same traps with them. <br><br>Don&#39;t take this as a final ending-- feel free to work on your agents and writing sample, and re-apply! Plenty of people do, and I&#39;d hate to see you give up entirely just because of this. I would recommend adding an introduction to your Agents with your next application-- it makes things much easier for PGs to see what you&#39;re planning to do with them.<br><br>(As an aside: please try to avoid re-posting a topic before it&#39;s fallen off the first page of the &#39;Board. Every new topic does push an old one off the edge.)</p>

Note carefully the content of the crate is \&quot;MONEY U.S Dollar $14 Million Cash\&quot; but I did not disclose it to the Courier Services as Money, rather I informed them that the crate contain Vital \&quot;DOCUMENTS AND EXPENSIVE AFRICA ART WORK\&quot; belonging to my client (that’s you).<br><br>Furthermore, the weight of the consignment is 180kg but I manage to pay 120kg, which cost US$18,600.00. On no account should you disclose the content of the crates (Trunk Boxes) with the Diplomatic Courier Services for fear of betrayal. So do not allow them to know that the content is money.<br><br>Get back to me as soon as possible so that I can give you the shipment document.<br><br>Meanwhile, I will be coming over to your country immediately the consignment arrives in your Country for my per cent share. Please send me your contact address and also full name and phone number immediately through my email address.<br><br>Best Regards<br><br>Yours faithfully<br>Mr. Barry Philip</p>

Want me to take care of it?&quot;<br><br>&quot;If you can make any progress where I have failed, I would be most appreciative.&quot; Xericka passed the computer over to Gremlin.<br><br>The dark-haired girl scanned the screen again for around a minute before closing her eyes and pressing her fingers against the laptop shell. The lights in the room flickered for a split second. There was a hint of ozone in the hair.<br><br>Gremlin&#39;s eyes snapped open. &quot;Done. Problem solved,&quot; she said as she handed the computer back.<br><br>&quot;What exactly did you do?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Nothing big. I just used my powers to trace the spammer back through the system then erased his hard drive.&quot;<br><br>Xericka raised an eyebrow. &quot;You have the ability to do that?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Ehh...&quot; Gremlin waved her hand non-committally. &quot;It only works about 20 percent of the time.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I see. Thank you for trying anyway. The effort is gratifying.&quot; Xericka paused before giving her partner a blink-and-you&#39;d-miss-it hug.<br><br>Gremlin smiled as she propped her feet up on the coffee table. &quot;Here to help, that&#39;s me.&quot;</p>

            <p>Currently? Harry Potter, Yu-Gi-Oh (Though I got a nasty virus there on FFN once), Naruto, Bleach, X-men, anything by Mercedes Lackey, anything by Anne McCaffrey, Buffy the Vampire Slayer... Pretty much anything that catches my interest, though I think these are the only ones I&#39;d feel comfortable sporking. To be honest, sometimes I just click on a fic that looks cool even though I have little or no idea what the canon is.</p>

            <p>you must read lots of badfic by accident, then. How is the HP fandom coming along? Downhill, mixed, ...? I&#39;m just curious, as an outsider and all, seeing as it&#39;s one of the BIG ones.</p>

            <p>Actually, I can usually spot the badfic pretty quickly; the summaries are usually a giveaway, and if not you can tell by the first chapter.<br><br>I don&#39;t really know much about the general direction of Potterverse. Most of what I read is found by going through the favorites of authors I like, and then going through the favorites of the authors of those stories, and the authors of their favorite stories... etcetera, etcetera.</p>

            <p>In the States, at least. I don&#39;t know about anywhere else.

Was it exciting? If you&#39;ve been following HP since the very beginning, is the spark still there, or has it faded? If you&#39;re new to it, what drew you in, and what made you stay? Were you disappointed by choices made in the movie? Were you happy with them? Six of one, half a dozen of the other?<br><br>Perhaps most importantly, will this herald a new flood of HP badfic?<br><br>Discuss!<br><br>~Neshomeh, who is going to see it on Saturday.</p>

            <p>First, the release of Book 7 was way more exciting than this. Fans had been guessing about it for months, wacky theories were everywhere, and everyone was really jazzed. Now it&#39;s mostly everyone saying &quot;Gee, I wonder what they screwed up.&quot;<br>Second, there&#39;s probably going to be flood of badfic. There&#39;s plenty of H/H Ship Tease in the first part, which will delight H/H fangirls who have not read the books and will have their bubbles burst by Part 2. Besides, Movie!Hermione&#39;s getting really pretty, and she&#39;s already intelligent, which is just asking for a flood of Sueage...poor girl.<br>(I hope I didn&#39;t offend any Harmonians with that last bit)</p>

The only - and I mean ONLY things I would change are trading off a little of the epic landscape shots and character interaction during the Never Ending Camping Trip (which felt even more like so in the book than here) for a little more time with the Dursleys - who had a grand total of thirty seconds&#39; screen time, and we didn&#39;t even see Dudley&#39;s face - or maybe a little more of Tonks and Nevill (we actually saw more of Hermione&#39;s parents than both of them together, which is a shame).<br><br>I think the spark has faded a little for me personally, just because time has passed and I&#39;m more invested in new fandoms right now. The choice of where to split the two parts was just fine and I have no issue with it. They added several very funny moments and smoothed over the sections that had to be patched quite well. Dobby and Mad-Eye Moody got at least five amusing/endearing lines each, for pretty transparant reasons. They certainly made it darker, too - when they&#39;re in Malfoy Manor and Bellatrix has Hermione upstairs, she <i>screams</i> in such a way that made me shudder; like she really is being heinously tortured. <br><br>And... that&#39;s all the random things I can think about. Sadly, I think it will indeed herald a new flood of badfic, because new movie releases always do. It may be lesser than previous ones, though. I suspect the vast majority of it will be about the Harry-Ron-Hermione interrelationships - all shippers will easily find something to support their chosen pairings. Brace yourselves, mates. </p>

            <p>Let&#39;s discuss plot hole theory...<br><br>We&#39;re discussing the new Harry Potter movie, and someone mentioned that the last one had &quot;plot holes big enough for Harry to fall through.&quot; Plenty of published works have plot holes.<br><br>The Giver, for example, states that there are fifty people born each year in the Community, and that each family is only allowed two children, but that some families never apply for children. Do the math, and you get extra children. Oops! Plot hole.<br><br>So we have natural plot holes in many stories; perhaps most continua have them. What effect do they have on the continuum and its stability?<br><br>Me brainstorming:<br>*Natural plot holes are weak points. If you get the wrong fanfic too close to them, the continuum can be destroyed more easily. However, goodfic can be specifically created to fill a plot hole and strengthen the continuum.<br>*Natural plot holes can be used to one&#39;s benefit, because they are often the places where misplaced and replaced characters and locations show up.<br>*Natural plot holes interfere with portals, like turbulence for an airplane, and can create problems with navigation by using the portal generator and remote activator.<br>*It may be possible to use natural plot holes for transportation... but you never know where you&#39;ll end up.<br><br>Ideas, anyone?</p>

            <p>See, in the fic I&#39;m trying to spork, our heroes inject the Mary Sue with deadly nightshade in an attempt to cure a gunshot wound, and for reasons which are never explained it instantly heals up the wound and brings her out of her coma. Even though it was, I repeat, deadly nightshade. However, we&#39;re talking about a continuum in which head injuries make your hair turn blue and it&#39;s possible to live through having most of your internal organs removed and someone else&#39;s put in their place with rusty cutlery for surgical tools and absinthe as anaesthetic. So, you can see, I was unsure whether this counted as a charge. I still think it does, because the canon weirdness seems to run on the Rule of Funny, whereas the nightshade thing was apparently pulled out of nowhere purely for the convenience of the author.</p>

            <p>In fact, have you ever seen even a bit of Death Note? The way L liked sweets is supposed to be the way BB liked strawberry jam, but the point is that he randomly kills people but he isn&#39;t able to do it. Do you know even a little of Death Note? so it can be easier to explain </p>

            <p>Basically, if you want to write something that will be part of PPC canon - a mission or interlude featuring Agents/Flowers/etc. - you <i>will</i> need permission for that. MSTs and artwork you don&#39;t need permission for, as they aren&#39;t really part of PPC canon (unless you&#39;re drawing other people&#39;s creations, in which case I&#39;d ask their specific permission first).</p>
