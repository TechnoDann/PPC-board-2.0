            <p>Hello!  I just recently found out about the PPC and decided that it would be a good idea to join.  My interests include sci-fi, redundancy wordplay, surreal film, redundancy wordplay, some fantasy (LoTR included), broken logic, and E.L.O.  I particularly dislike rapefic (especially when involving Pokemon), warrior!sues, and relationship!sues.  And onions.  I HATE onions.  I look forward to working with you people. [:</p>

            <p>That&#39;s right, the PPC is playing a succession game of Dwarf Fortress! Arranged on the IRC, this is still very much in the planning stage, but it&#39;s already underway with ObscurumAeterna playing the first year! We have high hopes for this fortress and we know it will stand the test of time and-<br><br>The fortress is named Armorstabbed.<br><br>Several people have already expressed interest on the IRC. They&#39;ll get the first turns, of course. But if you want to play, put your name down and we&#39;ll chalk you up on the list!<br><br>Here&#39;s the rules: Everyone plays one year. You have a week real-time. When you see &quot;Spring has Arrived!&quot;, save the file and pass it on. Remember to take pictures and make comments on them as time goes by in the year. If you completely ruin the fortress, we&#39;ll move back to the last save and pass it on to the next person.<br><br>(Note: Many of the people involved so far have little prior experience of Dwarf Fortress. This is undoubtably more Fun.)<br><br>Here&#39;s the list of people who have expressed interest in playing so far, not necessarily in this order:<br>ObscurumAeterna<br>July<br>Dann<br>Nakkel<br>Tranum<br>Artell<br><br>If you did express interest on the IRC and are not on this list, come by and we&#39;ll see what we can do.<br><br><b>What is Dwarf Fortress?</b><br>Dwarf Fortress is a game where, as the name suggests, you control a fortress of dwarves, keeping them fed, happy, and safe from a lot of things that want your dwarves dead. It lends itself to a lot of insanity, which the infamous LP Boatmurdered can explain better than I can.<br>*NSFW* <a href="http://lparchive.org/LetsPlay/Boatmurdered/">The Legend of Boatmurdered</a> *NSFW*<br><br>Let&#39;s all have lots of <a href="http://df.magmawiki.com/index.php/Fun">Fun.</a></p>

            <p>Few tips for you.<br><br>1) The mine being worked now was the first place I found any minerals, so I&#39;d advise going a z-level or two deeper rather than expanding those shafts. Just don&#39;t go past the tenth level down, or you risk stumbling upon a cavern and any HFS that might be lurking inside.<br><br>2) Read up on farming techniques; you might have a food shortage on your hands. The farm plot is a small room in the southeast corner of the fort&#39;s first level.<br><br>3) Have Fun. :D</p>

            <p>Well, this is interesting. :)<br><br>It&#39;s been several years since my last run-in with the PPC, and appear to have missed out on a great many developments. It should be interesting to get back in the snarker&#39;s saddle, since it&#39;s been equally long since my last MST. <br><br>As far as interests go : I am rather well-read as far as fiction goes, with a great many obscure (and ancient) science-fiction and fantasy series accounted for. Tolkien has historically been my main haunt as far as fanfiction is concerned, with a foray into Potterverse.<br><br>I don&#39;t have major dislikes in fanfiction; I generally don&#39;t read romance though, as it doesn&#39;t interest me too much.

            <p>I found four more Star Trek badfics. I&#39;ll, um, post links to them here. I hope you&#39;ll find it your hearts not to electrocute me through my keyboard. Now, while some of these fics are above PG-13, the excerpts I post are <i>not</i>, I promise you. They are, however, wildly, disastrously NSFB. Don&#39;t say I didn&#39;t warn you.

So, without further ado, here are the stories.<br><br><a href="http://forums.spacebattles.com/showthread.php?t=120742">Burning Thistles Among Thorns, a &#39;Star Trek: Voyager&#39; fanfic by Deborah L.

Just scroll down to post #17, and you&#39;ll find links to every chapter. (Word to the wise: do NOT scroll down.) Janeway and crew are enslaved, or somesuch. Doesn&#39;t really matter. A thesaurus must have exploded over this thing. That GAFF reviewer was right. This prose is not purple, this prose is not even urple, this prose is <i>friggin&#39; ultra-violet</i>! Excerpt?<br><br>&quot;The scorching ripples of the day&#39;s sea of humid false-fire spilling its almost invisible-to-the-eye imperfections, wafting up from the ground like a mirage and transporting a cargo of transparent smoke. Which then rose to life in liquid waves to eventually dart across the arid landscape and disappear into nothingness. As simultaneously, the too thin membranes of fragile vessels composed only of flesh and blood, all quite literally began to melt from the inside out. Stemming from the ever constant and intense exposure, as they continued to face the elevated stage and daisinabsolute silence under the open and spread umbrella of a devil&#39;s breath. Otherwise masquerading as the sun, which raged impressively in foreground perspective to them, strung high overhead now, and framing closely behind the shoulders of Toran in silhouette. The optical eclipse sphere illusion playing along his form with bursts of pinpoint spikes, flashing rays of illumination. In some ways, the effect it produced was very much in keeping with the historical painting renditions of the Madonna and Child from Earth&#39;s Christianity, bringing to mind the spectral visage of shining auras of lightening-encrusted prism shards, and golden crowns of omnipotent glory.&quot;<br><br>Uh, yeah, what she said.<br><br><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080216173738/www.angelfire.com/scifi/ravensnest/Lift.html">Pregnant Lady and a Lift, a &#39;Star Trek: Voyager&#39; fanfic by Raven Deacastra</a><br><br>Rated R (for a good reason)<br><br>A very short fic where, basically, Chakotay and a pregnant Janeway have painful, mechanical sex in a turbo-lift.

Because, you know, her babies would be taints upon the human race. Because they&#39;d be half-Vulcan. Right? Right. The villains are stupid because (among other things) they attempt to carry out the brainwashing and the aborting <i>in the woman&#39;s own house</i>, with her relatives less than a minute&#39;s walking distance away.

Part of the reason we ask people to wait a few months before asking for Permission is so that we can get to know you. If you&#39;ve only been posting for less than a month, and infrequently at that, I&#39;d have to ask you to hold off for a little while longer.<br><br>That said, your writing sample was pretty good-- no spelling or grammar errors I could see, and your agents seem rather concrete. I&#39;d just like to hold off on Permission until you&#39;ve been around a while longer.</p>

            <p>Honestly, I&#39;ve always just assumed that admins had the power to look into locked posts and such. I mean, sure, I&#39;ve never seen it happen before, but the suspicion that it could has always been there. Doesn&#39;t change that fact that it&#39;s pretty weird, unexpected, and quite worrying though. </p>

            <p>Of course the admins would have a way to get into entries-- that rather makes sense. Even the staff and abuse teams I could see. <br><br>The part that&#39;s creepy and frightening is where they&#39;re blatantly, almost deliberately unprofessional about it. It&#39;s not just keeping an eye on things, they&#39;re actually vandalising and abusing on their own, and through sockpuppets. And nobody in the LJ hierarchy calls them out, which is also pretty frightening. Especially for people who&#39;ve been using that site for years and have about half their life (and too much stuff to just copy-paste) up on it. </p>

            <p>And what&#39;s more, that&#39;s with the understanding that LJ is going to at least make an attempt to be fair-- that they won&#39;t ban out of spite and pettiness. Especially since people <i>pay</i> for accounts there. Quite a few of the incidents mentioned in that post happened to paid accounts-- and for LJ to be acting like that is stupid, dangerous, and also, as mentioned in one of the bullets, legally dubious.</p>

            <p>I agree with Nesh on the 3rd one, it&#39;s extremely similar to one or two other divisions patches and that could cause some confusion. <br><br>The first and the second one are both nice, but I find myself pulled toward the more bold, angular strokes of the first one.

            <p>I picked an ampersand because the SOD was described as taking on a lot of mission that were the &#39;miscellaneous of the miscellaney&#39; and it seemed appropriate. Admittedly, I pictured more of the conventional modern ampersand rather than something overly stylized, but I wasn&#39;t that specific in my suggestion.</p>

            <p>First of all, some departments had no flash patch images; that was why I started making images.

            <p>If I&#39;d tried to do anything more complex, I never would&#39;ve gotten as many done as I did, and even more departments would be sans flash patch. Also, some of them are actually heavily modified and took quite a bit of time. {; P<br><br>That said, while I was initially resistant to the idea of replacing everything on the purely selfish grounds of not wanting to see all the ones I made blithely replaced, the argument of consistency is a good one. A more or less consistent style on the wiki is something I am for, and I always was behind the effort to confirm flash patches for at least the best-known departments, so I say go ahead.<br><br>However, I do have one question. Have you remembered to place all your images in the <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Category:Flash_Patch_Images">appropriate category</a>?<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>It depends on the complexity of the patch. Most will take no more than a half hour to remap. Lucky I am a pack-rat when it comes to project files and have most if not all base pictures, layers, and colors I used to make the patches in there respective file. My only requirement is that I need a 500X500 pixel example of the preferred texture, in medium gray if possible.</p>

            <p>Maybe you could post example textures. I do like consistency, but remember these flash patches do have to contain a SEP field, which can be miniaturized but possibly not so much as to be simply printed on clothing... Don&#39;t take down any of the stuff you already did; but let&#39;s look at other options before we do more.</p>

            <p>You gotta love that series. Incidentally, for anyone who&#39;s interested, it is in reference to the third Yu-gi-oh anime series (To wit, Yu-gi-oh 5D) that deals with card games that are regularly played while racing along in overpowered motorcyles. For no apparent reason.</p>

            <p>Can&#39;t help you on the Stalking Mangina, that was Viper&#39;s line. And don&#39;t worry, I skimmed over a lot of the fic as well &gt;_<br>Couldn&#39;t resist the Lux bit. Wonder if there&#39;s a penalty for agents sleeping with canon characters, and whether it&#39;s lesser if the character in question knows who the PPC are. (The G-verse doesn&#39;t have much in the way of a Fourth Wall, and Murdoc&#39;s in direct contact with Hell, so we figured it&#39;s not unreasonable that at least he would have known throughout most of the canon and the other band members would have picked it up from him.)</p>

            <p>Well, the bestcrossover I&#39;ve ever seen was this Halo/Forgotten Realms fic called &#39;Finishing the Fight.&#39; It has Chief, Arbiter, Cortana, Johnson, and Cmdr. Keyes crash-landing in the D&amp;D-verse as an alternate ending to &#39;Halo 3.&#39; Prepare to have your mind blown, &#39;cause it&#39;s [REDACTED] AWESOME!! Seriously, Drizit and Neeshka fighting alongside the Arbiter and Master Chief against orcs, demons, drow, and who knows what else. No crossover could top that, NONE.</p>

            <p>It can&#39;t help but imagine Mudge being cynical, and Aslan showing up behind him and saying, in this very benevolent, amused voice, &quot;Really?&quot; And Mudge stammering while everyone else chuckled. <br><br>And that&#39;d be really cool (and I&#39;d be flattered, if the idea started at the meme).

            <p>Never seen any Spellsinger badfic, oddly enough. Unless you count the one-line mention of Mudge in &quot;Martin&#39;s First Time&quot;. (I&#39;m not sure whether to write a mission for that one, since I&#39;d basically be rehashing the MSTing. I&#39;m amused by the idea of the agents watching the bit where Skipper &quot;dropped his body&quot;, though.) Not sure whether to be relieved or disappointed at the lack of Spellsinger fic; on one hand, it&#39;s hard to find anyone who&#39;s heard of it, but on the other, we don&#39;t have to see what the badficcers could do to it.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m new here, just discovered the place earlier today. Or yesterday rather. Should probably be asleep right now, but who sleeps at night these days? That&#39;s why the powers that be invented afternoons. I&#39;m a young budding author, fanfic writer, and college student. I&#39;m a big anime fan, but sadly I&#39;ve yet to find the time to read anything new. So yeah, I&#39;m here to kill time and eventually write some stuff for PPC.<br><br>Like: Digimon, Yu-Gi-Oh (all 3 animes), Naruto, Bleach, Kingdom Hearts, Pokemon, Harry Potter, Soul Eater, D.Gray Man, other stuff I&#39;m too tired and stressed to remember. My favorite food is sushi, as complicated as possible. And my favorite desert is...who am I kidding, I love all desert. (is overweight)<br><br>Dislike: Math, idiots, having to wait a few months for all of the good video games to reach America, Mary Sues, the fact that Suefics seem to have tons of reviews despite the fact that they&#39;re bad enough to make me physically ill! No accounting for taste I suppose...<br><br>I could write more about myself but I&#39;ve never been one for personal descriptions, and I&#39;m tired. I&#39;m waiting for the day where they invent caffeine that can be absorbed into your blood through your skin. Coffee patches must be made!!</p>

            <p>Sorry you&#39;ve been waiting so long for a reply, but I haven&#39;t had time to come to the Board much lately, and it looks like the other PGs are in the same boat. <br><br>At a glance, your writing sample looks very good - no glaring technical errors and an easy-to-read style. It&#39;s a bit fast-paced, but that&#39;s a personal choice, however I&#39;ll point out that a bad title isn&#39;t a killing offense, even if it contains a typo.<br><br>The descriptions you&#39;ve given for your agents here in your request are very, very short, and don&#39;t tell me anything about what fandoms they work in or how long they&#39;ve been in the PPC, but are remarkably thorough nonetheless, and between that and your sample itself, I&#39;ve got a pretty good idea of how you plan to write them, and they look good - nothing (too) insane, nice contrast, good interactions. <br><br>However, you may not know that <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Cassie_Young">Cassie Young</a> is one of our until-recently-regular Boarders, and has written a lot of missions with her Agent Cassie; while this itself isn&#39;t a reason to change your agent&#39;s name, beware that it could become very, very confusing, both for your characters and Boarders. In your place, I&#39;d rename that agent or give her a nickname that she can be referred to most of the time.<br><br>In any case, everything looks good, so Permission Granted :)  Go forth and write!<br><br><br>(As a non-Permission-related note, PPC missions on FF.N tend to be taken down as soon as someone notices, as, strictly speaking, they do violte FF.N&#39;s TOS. You may want to find somewhere else to post.)</p>

            <p>You don&#39;t have to ask for Permission again, no - not now that I&#39;ve given it to you. You&#39;re free to do as you please. People need to request again when they&#39;ve been turned down the first time, and asked to reapply because their agents, writing, or some other aspect of their request failed to meet our standards, but once you have it, you have it - you can change agents and departments and fandoms as much as you please.
