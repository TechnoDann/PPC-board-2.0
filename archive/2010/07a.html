            <p>It&#39;s not actually PPC related, but this is the only place I know with a high concentration of literate LOTR fans.<br><br>I&#39;m not really concerned with technical stuff and OOC-ness, since I have faith in my spelling and grammar abilities and the story doesn&#39;t actually contain any canons. Actually, it&#39;s only loosely connected to LOTR at all, but I can&#39;t really separate it enough to make it original (nor do I want to). I&#39;m more worried about characterization (my main keeps turning into Legolas in my head, because he&#39;s my idea of Basic Tolkien Elf, and I really don&#39;t like that as the main isn&#39;t supposed to be Legolas) and style--I&#39;ve been trying to imitate Tolkien&#39;s semi-formal style, but I may have taken it too far. (Don&#39;t worry, no fake Shakespearean.) Also, I don&#39;t want my main turning into a Stu, and I figure that a second (or third, or fourth, or...) opinion is the best way to keep that from happening. Also worried about Bad Science and general lameness of plot devices.<br><br>It&#39;s set in modern times, starts off in a deep forest, probably the Congo. Main character is an elf, who (for unknown reasons) has stuck around long after all the others left for Valinor. (See what I meant by lameness of plot devices? But then, I figured that since most of the Elves seemed to have no desire whatsoever to leave M-E before a certain time--sort of a psychological &quot;lifespan,&quot; if you will--this one just never felt the urge.)<br><br>He doesn&#39;t have a name yet, pending me getting my lazy rear off the ground and actually doing some research on Sindarin. I&#39;m just referring to him as &quot;the Elf&quot; for now.<br><br>Here&#39;s the Google Docs link, if you&#39;re interested: <a href="http://docs.google.com/Doc?docid=0AWFNC2Jjdy-RZGQzOTVtcWdfMGNqM2N6eGNw&amp;hl=en&amp;authkey=CJOyu7IB"><a href="http://docs.google.com/Doc?docid=0AWFNC2Jjdy-RZGQzOTVtcWdfMGNqM2N6eGNw&amp;hl=en&amp;authkey=CJOyu7IB">http://docs.google.com/Doc?docid=0AWFNC2Jjdy-RZGQzOTVtcWdfMGNqM2N6eGNw&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;authkey=CJOyu7IB</a></a><br><br>I&#39;m not finished writing it, so I&#39;ll be adding on more as it gets written.</p>

            <p>...except that I can&#39;t find a thing about it that I&#39;d change. Not so much as a typo.<br><br>Sure, once it gets longer and there are more plot points and characters to worry about, you&#39;ll need a second set of eyes. But right now, it looks just fine to me. The writing style is good, too; formal, but not jarring.<br><br>I felt horribly sorry for your elf, though. Almost like I didn&#39;t want the story to go on, and have him see the things we&#39;ve done to the forest. And I&#39;m not even a huge environmentalist or anything.</p>

            <p>I&#39;ll also bring badfic printouts for a reading if anyone wants to do one. Need one we haven&#39;t done before, and &quot;My Immortal&quot; is a bit too long - what does everyone say to &quot;Forbiden Fruit&quot;? In it, a Mary Sue hooks up with &quot;Ewdard&quot; Cullen in horrific Urple prose, writes eyeburning poetry to him, and has a talking panda for a sidekick. No actual knowledge of Twilight required, because the fic doesn&#39;t bear the slightest resemblance to the canon. Or &quot;Blood omen&quot; or &quot;soulless shell&quot;, which are along the same lines as &quot;legolas by laura&quot; except with random lasers? Those are Redwall and I don&#39;t think Pads is familiar with that fandom, but again, it bears no resemblance at all to the canon, so knowledge of the canon isn&#39;t required to find them funny.</p>

            <p>Having all these Terry Pratchett inside jokes is forcing me to read the Discworld books. I&#39;m grateful.<br><br>Okay, there seems to be two dimensions /worlds, planes, thingies, whatever/- Canon, and Our World /reality whatever/ and then there are several in-between: Fanfiction and the PPC. <br>The problem is the PPC: it&#39;s making my head hurt. Badly. So, the PPC doesn&#39;t have a distinct planet/thingy (which is fine), but the Agents seem to have selective awareness (which is not fine, kind of like selective amnesia, which never works nicely unless you&#39;re Robert Ludlum).<br>The PPC knows about the &quot;Real World&quot;/Earth and the &quot;Fanfiction world(s)&quot; and &quot;Canon&quot;. However, the PPC has no idea where it came from: the agents just suddenly appear. Don&#39;t get me wrong, this stuff is great, but I dislike curiosity headaches. In PPC fanon/canon/whatever, is fanfiction a replacement of canon? Is canon entirely separate? I don&#39;t think so, seeing as there seems to be places where &#39;fics were &quot;restored to canon&quot;. However, this means that that particular world-thingy cannot be THE canon, because there are other fics written about it. If all the fics were applied at one time, to one world- that would be BAD. <br>I kind of have a theory (and if you&#39;ve read this far without becoming angry or giving up, good for you) and this is it: Canon is one dimension. A bit like quantum physics (which I barely know anything about), there is a time+place in every minute. Every time a &#39;fic gets written, the corresponding time+place in canon gets duplicated and that carbon copy of canon is what gets changed. When the &#39;fic is restored, that carbon copy is, too. I&#39;d like to think somewhere out there, there is an WORLD OF ORIGINAL CANON that has never been touched by anybody or anything or whatever. It just is. However-<br>Wait, OFUM is in the same dimension as PPC-<br>Brain is beginning to blow up with possibilities. Will stop now. <br><br>Okay, could you have PPC agents that wrote fanfiction? Could you have PPC agents that reviewed fanfiction? Other than OFUM and the PPC, are there other realms inbetween fanfiction and &#39;Real World&#39;/Earth? Plus, are fanfictions of, say, an American girl named Judy falling into Middle-Earth fanfictions of Real World/America/Earth? Because no such Judy certainly ever existed in &#39;Real World&#39;. That would put Real World/Earth and Canon into the same area, like a crossover. And-<br><br>*We&#39;re sorry, you just witnessed a •first thoughts only• brain attempt to think •second thoughts• and disintegrate into a puddle of confusion.

            <p>Imagine, for an instant, that a storyline is just that - literally a line, stretching through some meta-space. It&#39;s been Published, which makes it extra shiny and special. That storyline is the Canon for that particular work - Lord of the Rings has a Canon (two, if you count the movies), MIB has a Canon, and so on.<br><br>Immediately surrounding Canon is a tight weave of well-written fanfic storylines. It&#39;s like a rope - all nicely aligned, woven together, and although parallel threads don&#39;t always agree, the whole thing holds together nicely. This is good fanfic. Each fanfic takes a little bit of strength from the main Canon, but because it weaves right back in, the net effect is to make the whole thing stronger.<br><br>Surrounding that is the whole tangled mess of badfic, which makes our nice, neatly woven rope of fandom look like a messy yarn-ball. It&#39;s ugly, it&#39;s messy, and as each fic still takes strength from the Canon, it weakens the entire assemblage. The job of the PPC is to trim out those tangles and keep the rope of canon something resembling coherent and linear.<br><br>That&#39;s how I see it, anyways. Your perceptions may vary.<br><br>Now, World One is yet another Canon in that meta-space. It isn&#39;t our Earth, it&#39;s a fictional translation thereof. This is where it starts to get a bit mind-bending, as World One, along with all other fiction set in the &quot;real world&quot; (to a given limit of &quot;real&quot;) is also fanfiction, looping around the concept of the Real World (the actual, nonfictional space we inhabit).<br><br>Agents are usually Dangerously Genre Savvy, to borrow the term. Many of them break the fourth wall to some degree or another - the PPC is metafiction, so a little bit of recursive fun is always possible. </p>

            <p>Because I asked similar questions early on... And no, you won&#39;t be kicked off for rambling. I&#39;d know, if it could happen it would have already happened to me several times.<br><br>As for your questions, I don&#39;t see a problem with agents being aware that they&#39;re just words, or that someone&#39;s writing each word of their fate. Despite sounding pretty dark, I don&#39;t mean that everyone&#39;s hopelessly controlled or something similarly grim. I like to imagine it as more of a less parasitic relationship between the author and their characters/agents, with the words merely being a set of instructions for them as free-willed beings to follow, rather than complete and total control (which is what badfic does for the most part, in my opinion). The two can overlap sometimes, but that doesn&#39;t happen very often.<br><br>Second one. I think of the bad fanfiction being more like an infection or parasite of sorts, appearing at first in the general area it began, then spreading further and further until the original continuum is entirely replaced or damaged beyond repair. Fortunately, this is quite slow, and the continuum has natural defenses to deal with some of the badfic, so agents only need to destroy the major source of disruption, then the natural order restores itself for the most part. This means some just mediocre &#39;fic isn&#39;t going to cause any real damage.<br><br>These match up with one particular perception/theory of the PPCverse that&#39;s in my head. It&#39;s pretty detailed, so I won&#39;t post the entire thing here and now.<br><br>...Great, now you&#39;ve got me rambling...<br></p>

            <p>The PPC is itself a continuum. Some agents are aware that they have writers. For example:<br><br>July&#39;s agent of the same name discovers the Internet and (briefly) her Author:<br><a href="http://docs.google.com/Doc?id=dfg2s5q3_95d4qqcq83">Recursive Behavior</a><br><br>Also, part of the job of the DIO is to assassinate Mary Sues that have infiltrated the PPC. Sure, some of those are just Sued PPC agents who&#39;ve been exposed to a little too much glitter and been &quot;assimilated&quot;; but some of them are PPC agents written by PPC badfic writers. Jaycacia Thornbyrd is one famous example; you might also check the DIO web page; there are a couple of missions there. (Both things are linked on the wiki.) Note that the DIO neuralyzes regular PPC agents who come in contact with its agents; the PPC in general doesn&#39;t know of their existence.<br><br>So, basically, the PPC is a continuum like any other, a Word World connected by plot holes to all the other continua (except quarantined continua, ones where the author has forbidden fanfic). I&#39;ve seen multiple instances of agents able to see their own Words, such as when an agent gets annoyed and speaks in allcaps and someone else tells them to stop speaking in allcaps. No-Drool vidoes got the nickname of &quot;ellipsis debriefings&quot; in one fic, in which an agent was summoned for &quot;a ...debriefing.&quot; Similar things happen all the time.<br><br>So it&#39;s safe to say that particularly observant PPC agents do know they are fictional characters, and a few have even speculated about their Authors; but in the world of the PPC, fictional characters are real (that is, sentient, if they&#39;re written well enough). World One is special because it has such a high plot hole density. We don&#39;t know what, but plot holes tend to be instrumental in the creation of worlds (the Cascade, which created HQ, was a plot-hole-driven event). World One residents, if they have the ability, can become Authors, and mentally connect to different continua, either an established one or an undiscovered one. Whether they create new continua or just discover them is unknown (I tend to think they discover continua that exist already, in a multiverse where literally everything that could ever happen, does happen.)<br><br>To think about how visiting fics works, you have to think in more than three dimensions. Every canon is a continuum worlds, with not just the actual canon that does happen, but AUs that could have happened. A Mary Sue creates natural, uncontrolled plot holes, dragging canon out of shape and into dangerously improbable configurations; PPC agents create controlled plot holes that let them insert themselves into the fic in order to repair it. The main canon is the most probable arrangement; good AUs are the most probable of the alternate possibilities. A story is made of what does happen, and also of what could have happened. When uncontrolled plot holes damage a continuum, they connect extremely improbable possibilities to the main canon; and information can leak through them to damage the main canon. Eventually, left unchecked, the information becomes nonsense and meaningless, and loses its organization. In the end-stage, no usable information is left at all. Wild plot holes endanger the continuum because they damage the organization of the information that makes up the Word World.<br><br>If you need a 3d representation, think of a continuum as an infinite number of time-strings, stretching out into the distance. Each string is a world and all its events (at least four dimensions, possibly more in sci-fi continua). In the middle is the Main Canon, connected by goodfic and good AUs to the strings nearby, which are alternate possibilities, pulling (by way of information transfer, not physical force) on the Main Canon. These connections can&#39;t pull it far out of shape because they are so close to Canon; in fact, they strengthen the canon the way a rope of ten strands is stronger than a rope of one strand. The problem comes when a Suethor connects an extremely far-flung world to Main Canon. A string very far away from the main canon will pull it out of shape much further than one that is close; and because they are so far away, cannot strengthen the main canon; in fact, it pulls the main canon away from the goodfic and good AUs that give it some of its strength. This connection is the Mary Sue, the Author-wraith, or some rarer manifestation of natural plot-hole formation. Sever it, and the main canon springs back into the middle, where it should be. Let it be, and the nonsense from the least probable reaches of the continuum begins to destroy the order of the world.<br><br>When PPC agents visit a fic, they aren&#39;t, technically, visiting Main Canon. They&#39;re visiting a stretched version in which the Mary Sue exists. Even when they remove the Sue and canon returns to near-normal, they aren&#39;t, technically, visiting Main Canon, because Main Canon doesn&#39;t have PPC agents in it. Only when they leave to return to HQ does the Canon completely return to normal--though, because PPC agents represent goodfic, their presence wouldn&#39;t damage Main Canon any more than normal goodfic does even if they chose to stay.<br><br>Because every badfic stretches the Main Continuum in a slightly different direction, PPC agents don&#39;t tend to meet each other, as they are in different subcontinua. The one exception is a Ficverse Fusion event (has a wiki article; has only been observed once or possibly twice if the Les Miserables Songfic Crisis event was an example), in which very similar words cause two alternate sub-continua to merge.<br><br>Yes. PPC agents--especially those who drop through plot holes from World One--can write, read, and review fanfiction. There are actually some PPC agents who used to write badfic and have had to kill their own work.<br><br>Most PPC agents join the PPC after falling through a plot hole to the PPC; but quite a few are brought through plot holes by agents in the field. The PPC itself is a continuum made of an infinite number of sub-continua.<br><br>Brain hurting yet? Good. :)</p>

            <p>The problem with statements like &quot;Thranduil is NOT an abusive father&quot; is that while it&#39;s generally assumed to be true, and most of the fans (note the distinction between fans and fangirls) prefer to think it&#39;s true, I don&#39;t believe it&#39;s specifically stated in canon. And the fangirls jump on it so they can write badslash h/c or SuexLegolas h/c.<br><br>Even if it *is* stated in that particular instance, the same applies for ninety percent of fanon backstories, especially the abusivetragicpast!backstories.

            <p>Rookie PPC member Sergio Turbo requesting permission, sir!<br><br>Agents:<br><br>Name: Sergio Turbo<br>Species: Human<br>Home Continuum: N/A<br>Department: Department of Floaters<br>Background: Sergio is an alter ego/clone of a genetically-engineered Author Avatar character. He was somehow spawn when the authors decided to remake the fanfiction from the beginning, but when the plan was abandoned he was left without an homeworld. He joined the PPC, and took care of Corolla after finding her.<br>Personality: Despite trying to keep a serious and controlled behaviour he ends up wall-banging and using excessive force when the fiction to spork is awful or when his partner has strange ideas... which means all the time.<br>Skills: He is able to speak English and Italian, and is able to use a wide range of guns. He is also rumored to be very good at driving, but also quite reckless. It means that nobody actually would ask him a ride. His skills are, however, inferior of original Sergio Turbo&#39;s ones, that had some Suvian-like abilities.<br>Weapons: Despite collecting all sorts of guns and weapons previously owned by Sues or bit characters he relies on his Beretta 92FS and a combat knife. Sometimes uses a Random Sue Execution Gun, but also states it&#39;s absolutely unreliable.<br>Appearance: Nearly 6 foot tall and quite thin, has brown eyes and brown hair.<br><br>Name: Corolla<br>Species: Unison Device<br>Home Continuum: Nanohaverse (Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha)<br>Department: Department of Floaters<br>Background: Somehow collected by Sergio Turbo on a mission, she was found with severe wounds that required a long stay at Medical. Since she was not a canon character, but also not a canon-disrupting one, she was allowed to join the PPC and became Sergio&#39;s partner.<br>Personality: Childish and very close to being crazy, she&#39;s hyperactive and has a strong will to eat Sue meat and blood, depite Sergio&#39;s disapproval.<br>Skills: Due to her wounds she lost a lot of her magical abilities, such as Unison with a Nanohaverse mage, but the &quot;repairs&quot; made her capable of scanning characters and opening portals without proper devices. Corolla&#39;s leftover magical skills allow her to successfully bind and exorcize Author-Wraiths with ease, but are useless to play any offensive role. She was enough lucky to being able to fly again, or her doll-sized body would have been an obstacle to her careeer.<br>Weapons: None, but she borrows Sergio&#39;s knife very often.<br>Appearance: She has blue eyes and brown hair. Due to her nature, she is only six inches tall, and the wings of magic energy that uses when she needs better flying capability make others misrecognize her as a fairy.<br><br>Writing sample:<a href="http://rc1587.splinder.com/post/22951812/beginnings-write-sample"><a href="http://rc1587.splinder.com/post/22951812/beginnings-write-sample">http://rc1587.splinder.com/post/22951812/beginnings-write-sample</a></a><br>(I gave to my blog the RC number I am going to request if I get permission)<br><br>First badfic: <a href="http://www.scrignodeisogni.it/IM-FA/sarachan.htm"><a href="http://www.scrignodeisogni.it/IM-FA/sarachan.htm">http://www.scrignodeisogni.it/IM-FA/sarachan.htm</a></a>  WARNING: Background color of the page is something very close to Urple. Painful. And it is written in Italian, so open only if you really want to.<br>Here, a Sue puts the whole canon in background. The plot is basically the love story between a Sue and a Stu, while canon characters of Card captor Sakura do absolutely nothing interesting and Card Captor Sakura&#39;s true plot is nearly forgotten. Use of Japanese honorifics in Italian language, some bad-written phrases, plotholes, and the whole plot is clearly nonsense. And it is the tip of the iceberg.</p>

            <p>Two things:<br><br>1. Keep working on this weird English language. Mostly you&#39;re doing pretty well, but there are a few issues of tense and number agreement--for example:<br><br>-- You wanted &quot;Writing Sample,&quot; not &quot;Write Sample.&quot;<br><br>-- &quot;He was somehow spawn&quot; should be &quot;He was somehow spawned.&quot;<br><br>-- The sentence &quot;It was supposed that everybody here were dead&quot; should be &quot;It was supposed that everybody here <b>was</b> dead,&quot; because &quot;everybody&quot; is a collective, which means you treat it as a singular noun. Also, although &quot;were&quot; is sometimes used instead of &quot;was&quot; in hypothetical situations, this isn&#39;t hypothetical; it&#39;s a statement of what was truly believed by someone.<br><br>... I hope that&#39;s not too much information to be helpful. ^_^;<br><br>Anyway:<br><br>2. Please please please use quotation marks for dialogue. I don&#39;t know if hyphens are standard in Italian, but they are not standard in English. If someone did that in a fic I was PPCing, it would be a charge. Unless you&#39;re James Joyce, you use quotation marks.<br><br>Also, do bear in mind that Corolla will be in disguise unless the agents are on a mission to her home continuum. I can&#39;t think of any others that would allow a fairy doll thing to go unremarked. Also, is the flesh-eating usual for her kind?<br><br>Finally, I&#39;d be interested in what other people have to say before actually granting Permission; maybe someone who knows the Nanoha continuum?<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I&#39;m still working a bit on the language, Italian has a grammar basis completely different from English, as the use of hyphens in direct dialogue. I didn&#39;t knew that hyphens were not accepted in English, and that&#39;s quite a surprise, I&#39;ve got good marks in English (an average 8, that means 80 points out of 100).<br>Thank you very much, I cannot go sporking if I keep doing those nasty mistakes.<br><br>The &quot;fairy thing&quot; is something that would actually happen in HQ, as Corolla would disguise herself as an human (except for the Nanohaverse, as Unison Devices are from that continuum). In fact, Unison Devices are able to change form an &quot;grow&quot; to a child-size one, but this is not widely shown in the Nanohaverse (in fact, only in some official arts), and it can be related to the master&#39;s mana (and Corolla doesn&#39;t have a master). Not sure about that, informations are very scarce. The only thing I&#39;m really sure it&#39;s right is the car-based name, common in the Nanohaverse<br><br>Unison Devices actually eat the same things as normal humans do (more or less the ame amount of food that a little child is able to eat), but Corolla&#39;s taste for Sue meat is something based of Stu of the day, Sue Souffle and Water served in the cafeteria, and exaggerated for the Rule of Funny. However, she usually eats cooked sue meat, and almost always she instead handles the corpse to the Cafeteria. Considered that Corolla is nearly ax-crazy, I thought it was reasonable. But I can tone it down, if needed.</p>

            <p>OK, so when I write, I&#39;m forever finding that I&#39;ve used the same (rare) word twice in close succession in a piece. For example, in my last blog post, I had the word &quot;overabundance&quot; twice in three paragraphs, and eventually had to take out both occurrences.<br><br>The more rare a word is, the less it should be used. I like words, and I like to pick just the right one. But once a word sticks in my mind, I may use it too often. Phrases are similar; using the same phrase more than once when you&#39;re not using repetition to make a point isn&#39;t desirable.<br><br>I find it very annoying, because it breaks suspension of disbelief and forces the reader to realize they&#39;re reading something rather than experiencing it.<br><br>I have been thinking that there really ought to be computer programs to check for word frequency, the way computers can check spelling and the very basics of grammar. All it would have to do is count words, compare them, and then compare that to a word-rarity chart. Rare words used more than once, too close together, would be flagged.<br><br>Is there such a thing as a word-frequency analysis program? Other than beta-readers and tricks like waiting a few days and re-reading, or reading out loud, I haven&#39;t found a really good way of catching overused words.</p>

            <p>I think that you either figure out which words you over-use and use &quot;Find&quot;, or paste the text into a word cloud creator, which will automatically show you some of the words used most frequently. <br><a href="http://www.wordle.net/">Wordle is a good website.</a><br><a href="http://tagcrowd.com/">So is TagCrowd (it also allows you to upload text from another source, like a Word document, as long as it isn&#39;t larger than the allotted MB amount).</a><br><a href="http://www.abcya.com/word_clouds.htm">ABCya! is worth giving a try.</a><br>Maybe this will help.

            <p>I can totally relate to your troubles. That would be a handy thing to have. The nearest thing I can think of is the &quot;Find&quot; option under microsoft word- it lets you find every instance where you used a specific word, but then again you have to know what word you want to look for with that tool so I guess it doesn&#39;t really match what you&#39;re looking for. <br><br>Maybe some day.<br><br>Until then, rereading and beta readers will have to suffice.</p>

            <p>But generally I notice and try to change it.<br><br>On the other hand, then I find myself using the same set pattern of synonyms over and over again, or just using too many variants on the same word, so it sounds more like I&#39;m violently shaking a thesaurus to see what falls out than actually writing.

            <p>Wow, did I just get scolded...  Now, I know you&#39;re likely to be on my side, but I need to hear someone, anyone, else&#39;s opinion on this.<br><br>I&#39;ve been reading a humorous story about what was really going on during the movies, including an OOC Vader and reasons for the stormtroopers to be bad shots.  I was my usual self in reviews -- it made me laugh enough that I was pretty positive in the beginning, except one chapter that disappointed me, and I was fairly positive but said what bothered me.  I usually comment on blatant or amusing spelling/grammar errors/typos and general issues I think should be better.  The author asked me to be less picky because it was just for fun.  Of course, with all the stories I&#39;m reading and my habits, I didn&#39;t always remember this.<br><br>The last chapter, I commented on the fact that he said &quot;lamented sadly&quot; which I found to be a perfect example of redundancy and overuse of adverbs.  I also complained about people who describe Yoda as a &quot;troll&quot; (not that kind), not saying that it just plain annoys me (bad reasoning) but giving the reason that fairy tales and people&#39;s judgements of weirdness aren&#39;t the same in space.  I also mentioned something I was confused about and said something minor that I liked.  He *really* scolded me for being overly negative.<br><br>I answered, feeling embarrassed but trying to be cheerful.  I said I got the message, it&#39;s hard to remember who wants, who doesn&#39;t mention, and who doesn&#39;t want criticism.  I didn&#39;t say it, but some people have told me my reviews are their favorite, and he&#39;s the only one who&#39;s said he doesn&#39;t want this.  I said I know I&#39;m too negative and it&#39;s a problem.  I said I wouldn&#39;t apologize about the troll thing because it really bothers me.  I also said that I obviously think it was good or I wouldn&#39;t be reading it, I think it&#39;s ingenious, and I was considering sending it to you guys as an example of a good OOC.  I expected this to be the end of it unless I forgot again.<br><br>But he was apparently really mad at me.  He told me that I should be telling him the nice things and lectured me for FOUR PARAGRAPHS about being a good person.  He said that I apparently have bad reading comprehension because I&#39;m confused about some things (I&#39;ve only mentioned this twice and said I was distracted while reading it for one of those times) and he&#39;s surprised that someone so nitpicky would.  He told me to go work on my own writing, kindness, and comprehension.  He also said I nitpicked for thirteen chapters.  I just counted, and I left nine reviews, by my count three positive, four mixed, and two negative, including three nitpicky things, one of which wasn&#39;t directed at him but the fandom.  Finally, in the kindest and politest way possible, he asked me to go away.<br><br>My mouth dropped open while I was reading this; I&#39;ve never had anyone say anything like that before.  Now, you have to know that I have mild social phobia, and even though I take criticism about my stories because my writing matters that much to me, I can&#39;t stand personal criticism that I can&#39;t brush off as a flame.  It&#39;s proof that I&#39;ve improved that I don&#39;t feel like deleting everything I&#39;ve put on the internet and crawling into a hole anymore, but it still physically hurts.<br><br>I also found that he had commented on his story basically making fun of me.  The way he&#39;d written it, I thought, &quot;Oh, he&#39;s had a few like this, that&#39;s why he&#39;s annoyed,&quot; but there was no more criticism at all on the page of the most recent reviews.<br><br>So now I&#39;m thinking, he gets tons of reviews (it really is tons for a first story) and all but mine are positive, but he can&#39;t stand that?  A lot more sensitive than me.  He&#39;s telling *me* to be less serious but he makes such a big thing about it?  Or was I really that wrong not to have stopped criticizing after he asked me to?  And should I answer him or will this just cause a big argument?</p>

            <p>I think he was definitely overreacting and (pardon my French) being an asshole, although I&#39;d have to see the exact conversation. Not that I think you&#39;re lying, but paraphrasing does have a tendency to <br><br>I&#39;d say ignore him. Some people are like that, and you&#39;re going to run into people who counter-flame for no good reason, but it&#39;s best not to take it too personally. There are plenty of nice, reasonable people on the Internet, too (Just look at this board!), and people like this guy are a minority. Sometimes you can reason with them, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;ll work with this one.<br><br>That being said, I would point out that if he only wants to be told the nice things, he&#39;s never going to improve. Self-criticism is a notoriously shoddy method of editing, and while flaming is also bad, a healthy dose of con-crit is wonderful for a writer&#39;s style.</p>

            <p>I think the best thing to do is just stop communicating with this individual.  S/he obviously doesn&#39;t want any help with their writing, so leave them to it.  And as you said, they might even be going through a bad time, or something, so there&#39;s nothing to be gained from pressing the issue, and things could get worse easily.  So I say, just drop it.<br><br>On the subject of social phobias, it took me an AMAZINGLY long time in grade school to understand that there are people out there who will be rude to me for no apparent reason.  The best way to cope with it is just roll with the hits when you have to, and surround yourself with friendly people when you can...but maybe don&#39;t become quite so much of a homebody as I have.  That shit ain&#39;t healthy.</p>

            <p>(Isn&#39;t that a neat phrase? I picked it up recently from... Trojie, I think. Never heard it before. Better than &quot;drama queen&quot;, certainly. Now on to my opinion...)<br><br>I say just drop the matter. Like Neshomeh says, some of the things you wrote could come off as challenging or superior, though this author would have to be either pretty short-tempered or young not to be able to handle that. There&#39;s no way to know - maybe he&#39;s a drama llama and maybe he was just having a bad day. In either case, it&#39;s just not important enough to trouble yourself with.<br><br>If you really want to send something, a simple response saying &quot;I see. I will stop reviewing now.&quot; is probably the only vaguely safe thing. If he can&#39;t take criticism, that&#39;s not your problem - leaving reviews is a favour you were doing. So just stop. Remember, you&#39;ll never please everyone. I&#39;ve been in exactly the same situation several times, and the only thing to do is walk away. <br><br>Also, take care not to be a dramam llama yourself. It&#39;s just a review. I wouldn&#39;t worry. :)</p>

            <p>I don&#39;t doubt you, but seeing what you wrote might help me understand how another person might interpret it.<br><br>That said, if this is on ff.net, it sounds like this guy didn&#39;t read the posting guidelines. I&#39;m pretty sure it explicitly says &quot;not all reviews have to be purely good.&quot; &#39;Cause they don&#39;t. If he&#39;s not okay with that, he shouldn&#39;t be posting. There&#39;s certainly no call for anyone going around saying that people who give concrit are bad people; and I&#39;m sorry, but if a reader is honestly confused about something even after trying to figure it out (which I assume you, as an astute reader, did), then it&#39;s the author&#39;s job to figure out what the problem is and fix it, not judge their reading comprehension. That&#39;s just insulting.<br><br>In closing, &quot;just for fun&quot; is not an excuse for carelessness. If your sloppy writing makes it hard for the reader to stay engaged, it&#39;s no longer fun for them. If you don&#39;t care about the readers, then write for the drawer.<br><br>~Neshomeh, who can&#39;t stand people whining about the concrit they should consider themselves lucky to get--it&#39;s not easy to find people who will do it!</p>

            <p>I guess I was more nitpicky than I thought, but I now count one more as positive rather than mixed.<br><br>chapter 1<br>Nice! Poor guy, but great writing.<br>(Positive)<br><br>chapter 2<br>Oh, no, not an amnesiac. *headdesk* Ughhhhh!<br>Okay, I&#39;ll give you the benefit of the doubt that you&#39;ve researched it and can make it plausible, but still...<br>And haven&#39;t you ever noticed that the great majority of characters in this galaxy don&#39;t have English names... probably because there is no English because there is no Earth?<br>(negative, possibly nitpicky)<br><br>chapter 4<br>Okay, this is REALLY interesting. And it explains a lot about the movies.<br>I can&#39;t see Darth Vader thinking &quot;crap&quot;, though. &quot;Shit&quot;, maybe. Maybe.<br>(Mixed, nitpicky)<br><br>chapter 5<br>I assume this isn&#39;t complete, because there&#39;s still the stormtrooper to deal with, right?<br>(totally neutral)<br><br>chapter 6<br>This is going to get confusing with all the doubles, but I can&#39;t wait to see what happens next!<br>(Positive, includes some hint of confusion)<br><br> chapter 7<br>Chains of clones... wow...<br>I think I know where Johnny Doe comes from now.<br>I pretty much love this story, now, all because of LTWTL. Awesome! And the WTF was perfectly placed.<br>(Positive, I&#39;m not sure if me saying something positive about one word is nitpicky...)<br><br>chapter 9<br>Okay, to begin with, Leia doesn&#39;t really need a lie detector test, though she probably doesn&#39;t know this. She has some Force powers, so she has to be a good enough lie detector herself. But also, if someone&#39;s good enough to look completely genuine to a politician, chances are great that he&#39;s good enough to fool the lie detector, too. So... well, if I were her, I&#39;d watch what I said around him.<br>I KNEW [SPOILER]! Yay!<br>R2 is AWESOME. I always loved him, and it&#39;s great to understand his thoughts. I wish nobody had ever come up with the idea of writing it &quot;Artoo,&quot; though. Ridiculous. Especially when it&#39;s in narration, not dialogue. And I seem to be the only person in the world who feels this way. Ugh.<br>(mixed, nitpicky about the fandom)<br><br>chapter 10<br>I got confused about the time jump. That might be my fault, though; I&#39;m distracted by a very bad internet connection.<br>So he&#39;s a natural pilot. We should have known. :D If Leia *really* likes him it could be because of genetic attraction - people are often attracted to close relatives they didn&#39;t grow up with. It&#39;s true.<br>(Positive except a bit of confusion)<br><br>chapter 13<br>“Lamented sadly”? A bit redundant? The whole point of using a word like “lamented” is to avoid an adverb.<br>I don&#39;t like those descriptions of Yoda as a &quot;troll&quot;. I mean, it&#39;s weird because we don&#39;t know what a troll is (there are so many opinions), and where do they get the word from? Are their fairy tales like ours? Wouldn&#39;t they have different ideas of strange-looking creatures?<br>So is this the real Yoda or not... I can&#39;t remember!<br>So that&#39;s why stormtroopers can&#39;t shoot straight.<br>(negative, and he went crazy)</p>

            <p>The way things are worded might have come off as challenging, though. Phrasing as questions things that aren&#39;t actually inquiries is essentially saying &quot;I question you! Defend yourself against my probing!&quot; and so that&#39;s what people do.<br><br>Similarly, starting off sentences with things like &quot;Okay, to begin with&quot; basically translates to &quot;Brace yourself,&quot; putting the reader on the defensive before they read what you really have to say. So, that could be contributing to his negative reaction.<br><br>However, he&#39;s still way out of line to insult you like he did. You never actually implied that his writing or intelligence was sub-par, and really you raise some interesting points about naming conventions and fairy tales.

            <p>While in the course of chatting in the PPC IRC room, it became apparent that the list of tropes on the <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProtectorsOfThePlotContinuum">PPC&#39;s TVTropes page</a> was ridiculously long--longer than the Firefly page--so several of us (8-10, depending) took it upon ourselves to trim it. So, no need to panic if you wander over there and find a bunch of stuff gone. {= )<br><br>Basically, we went down the list and voted for each trope on the basis of relevancy to the PPC as a whole, removing tropes with only one example or with example(s) that don&#39;t really apply to us. Voting was decided by majority.<br><br>We would also like to note that editing so that 75% of the list items mention your agents is discouraged. The PPC is a community, even if we don&#39;t all feel like editing on TVTropes.<br><br>You may now return to your regularly scheduled mayhem.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I think that was actually a failed cut. However, as I wasn&#39;t the one actually cutting things, you&#39;ll have to take it up with whoever was. I believe it was KGarrett, but there were enough of us on when we were voting on what to clean up that I&#39;m not sure.</p>

            <p>There are days when, sitting down and trying to write something, I wonder if what I am writing is goodfic or badfic.

            <p>I&#39;ve got a Kingdom Hearts fic on the Pit that I haven&#39;t looked at in ages.  It got a (very small handful of) positive but general reviews.  As college became more time-intensive, I slowed down working on it, and then stopped altogether.  Then I discovered the PPC, and began to get worried about whether my OC was a Mary-Sue or not.  I&#39;ve actually become more confident of it lately, and plan to go back and revise the fic before eventually continuing it.<br><br>Anyway, I guess we sometimes have to face the fact that, no matter how much we enjoy writing fanfiction, it&#39;s always going to be fanfiction.  While we should always put in an appropriate effort to make sure it&#39;s good, we shouldn&#39;t become disheartened when our writing isn&#39;t great.  No one will ever write about Harry Potter as well as J.K. Rowling did, and that&#39;s okay; we can still enjoy the attempt at rising to meet her work even when we don&#39;t quite touch it.</p>

            <p>...can be tricky. It&#39;s always nice to know that somebody likes your story, but I&#39;ve seen Legendary Badfics get similar positive feedback. I&#39;ve made a habit of looking at other fics my reviewers have also given positive reviews, to see if they generally have good taste in writing.

            <p>I know exactly how you feel. I&#39;m wrangling with the same thing myself, actually. Add to that that I&#39;ve stopped trusting the good reviews I get on the pit, since I&#39;ve gotten glowing reviews for stories that I think now are PPC worthy. -wince- There&#39;s a reason -- apart from my general lazy nature and persistent writer&#39;s block -- that I haven&#39;t posted anything there in months.<br><br>Mainly, I just keep writing. I know it&#39;s not a too terribly helpful answer, but it&#39;s the only way I&#39;ve found to get through it. Currently (well, for way over a year now) I&#39;m working on a Harry Potter next generation &#39;fic, and I too think that my characters are perhaps not quite as canonical as they could be. (It&#39;s been a <i>long</i> time since I was eleven, and never have I been the youngest son of a celebrity, so I&#39;m having a hard time imagining how the boys think.) I have a list a couple miles long of things to change once I finish the first draft. But I have to finish it first. I subscribe very firmly to the theory that you can&#39;t edit what isn&#39;t there, and so I have a first draft first rule. Only when that&#39;s finished can I go back in and see if, one, it&#39;s worth keeping at all, and two, how to make it better.<br><br>I guess this is a kind of a long winded way of saying that we&#39;re in the same boat, and I would recommend just writing it as well as you can the first time around, and then going back later. Rereading your own stuff, at least for me, is always fun, and while there are always many cringe-worthy moments, there are often some, &quot;<i>I</i> wrote that? Wow...&quot; moments as well.<br><br>Hope this helps. Even if it doesn&#39;t, know that you are in no way alone. <br><br>--anamia</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve had a bunch of questions which I&#39;ve been nursing for a while, and since I get to request Permission in a few days (:D My first post was a month ago this Monday) I figured I&#39;d ask &#39;em all now.<br><br>1. MSS. The PPC archive says it affects World One characters, but can it affect natives of other canons? One of my potential Agents is the offspring of a &#39;Sue and a Possession!Stu, so I figure it&#39;s only fair that she get the disorder.<br><br>2. On Elves of the LOTR variety. Do they or do they not have pointy ears? I&#39;ve been assuming so, since I don&#39;t believe Tolkien ever specified and they did in the movies. They weren&#39;t obvious, but they were there.<br><br>3. Minis. I found an HP fic with a mini (&quot;Hegwig&quot;). I know that the HP fandom has mini-Aragogs, but I find the idea of a mini-Hedwig irresistible (I mean, for sheer &quot;Squee!&quot; value... I like birds, okay?) and I&#39;ve noticed other sporks with non-conformist minis. Is this just Rule of Cool/Funny, or is there an actual law governing this?<br><br>4. This isn&#39;t a question so much as a request--I need some help with Elvish languages, mostly for naming characters (and mostly Sindarin, although Quenya would be nice, too). I&#39;ve found a good dictionary, but I can&#39;t seem to figure out how to squash words together. My penname in the Pit is Kaiko Aozora; send me a PM if you can help.<br><br>5. Piper&#39;s Children. This question is Keys-specific, but I can&#39;t find the information anywhere else. What makes a Piper&#39;s Child stop aging? Would they start aging again once they left the House? One of my Agent-concepts is an ex-Piper&#39;s Child, so...<br><br>6. Just out of curiosity, I have four Agent concepts. Should I post all of them with my request, or just two?<br><br>I know I had some more, but I can&#39;t remember them just now. I&#39;ll add &#39;em in once I do.</p>

<li>MSS = &quot;Mary Sue Syndrome&quot;? If so, I&#39;d say it can affect natives of other canons as well.<br>If you&#39;re referring to something else, then not sure.<br><br>2. Tolkien said something along the lines of them having &quot;leaf shaped ears&quot; (He didn&#39;t specify which leaf; I&#39;m assuming not a maple leaf or anything like that). My personal view is that they&#39;re a bit more rounded than as portrayed in the movies, but still more elongated than most human ears.<br><br>4. Ardalambion is good; Real Elvish also has some name lists (arranged by meaning) <a href="http://www.realelvish.net/namelists.php"><a href="http://www.realelvish.net/namelists.php">http://www.realelvish.net/namelists.php</a></a><br>Most of them seem to be legit, as far as I can tell.<br><br>6. I&#39;d say post all four. There&#39;s nothing that says you can only have two Agents. That said, it&#39;s a good idea to only have as many Agents as you can write properly (hypocritical, I know, from the guy with six Agents; three of which have hardly gotten any screen time).<br><br>Elcalion</li>

<li>What do you mean by &quot;MSS&quot;? I&#39;m not familiar with the term and neither the PPC wiki or proper Wikipedia are giving me an explanation. <br><br>2. Generally, we assume that they do, but I wouldn&#39;t make it a big Charge if you can avoid it unless it&#39;s absolutely, definitely movieverse.<br><br>3. It&#39;s closer to an actual &#39;law&#39; than not, simply because we do <i>try</i> to be consistent throughout as many stories as possible. There may be a reason why other minis don&#39;t conform - such as, maybe, that there was description in the fic they were found in that directly influenced their appearance. I&#39;d really rather that you didn&#39;t make a mini-Hedwig; perhaps your agents could adopt a forced-into-OOC-ness replacement for Pigwidgeon instead?<br><br>4. <a href="http://folk.uib.no/hnohf/">Ardalambion</a> is <i>the</i> best site I know for Tolkien&#39;s languages; I haven&#39;t explored the whole thing, but there&#39;s a course showing you exactly how the grammar of Quenya works, so that should help you somewhat. <br><br>5. No idea, sorry. I don&#39;t know the fandom.<br><br>6. Unless you plan on having all four of them work together in your missions (and for sheer confusion factor, I strongly suggest you <i>don&#39;t</i>, at least not for the first few missions), then stick to the two you will be writing about. Remember, mission writing is really a lot more work than it looks, so you won&#39;t be churning them out every few days. Start slow. There&#39;s always time later. <br><br>Hope that helped. </li>

<li>Mary Sue Syndrome. There&#39;s a page on the wiki about it, although I don&#39;t know if just MSS gets you anywhere.<br><br>2. I wasn&#39;t planning on Charging; I was just curious for the sake of continuity. (I found a spork where one of the Agents was rather vehemently denying the fact. It confused me.)<br><br>3. Ah, I see. Now I&#39;m getting a mental image of a Snowy/Scops hybrid... &#39;Hegwig&#39; sounding like a mix of Hedwig/Pigwidgeon.

<li>Head, meet desk. I should&#39;ve remembered that. And no, &quot;MSS&quot; doesn&#39;t redirect anywhere on our wiki; I&#39;ll have to fix that. <br><br>2. Agents tend to have their own views of canon just like everyone else. A fanatic Tolkien purist may indeed refuse to see elves as having pointy ears, and they have every rigth to. But curiosity is good :)<br><br>3. Thanks for that. <br><br>4. Careful, it&#39;s addictive. I tried to take the Quenya course several times, but it&#39;s a lot of work. <br><br>:)</li>

            <p>Hey, a question I can actually help with!<br><br>To my knowledge, though I could be wrong on this, the Piper&#39;s Children stop aging for two reasons:<br><br>1) Time flows differently in the House, meaning that what would be days for them could be anything from seconds to years in the world they came from.<br><br>2) After spending enough time in the House, their humanity slowly starts to fade, and they become part Denizen. Also, due to being part Denizen, I don&#39;t think they age outside of the House either, or if they do, it&#39;d be much slower.<br><br> So, to that effect, you couldn&#39;t exactly have an ex-Piper&#39;s Child, because the Piper&#39;s Children are what they are. You could have a Piper&#39;s Child who no longer lived in the House, but I think it&#39;s far more likely that a Piper&#39;s Child who was an Agent would have simply descovered a hallway in the House that connected to a hallway in the HQ, and just assumed that this was all part of the House and how it worked.</p>

            <p>What&#39;s the age range? I don&#39;t really want to have a child-aged Agent, but I like the idea enough that I don&#39;t want to scrap it.<br><br>I didn&#39;t think the Piper&#39;s Children were part-denizen, although I suppose it makes sense... I&#39;d assumed that they&#39;d have some level of magical contamination (like Arthur) but not enough to stop them aging (Arthur didn&#39;t). I&#39;d also sort of assumed that they&#39;d have some physical resemblance to Denizens if they were hybrid creatures; maybe the blue blood..? As it is, they don&#39;t really. But then again, it&#39;s been a while since I read the books, so I&#39;m probably wrong.</p>

            <p>Again, not certain, but I believe the Piper&#39;s Children were anywhere between 10 and 16. Suzy, for example was twelve, and had been twelve for the past ~100 years. Also, I know they can&#39;t get sick naturally, like Denizens, which is why Suzy was interested in Arthur&#39;s cold the first time they met. Them having blue blood would also make sense. Or possibly blue-violet-ish blood, since they&#39;re only part Denizens? Either way, I don&#39;t think it was ever outright stated what color their blood was.</p>

            <p>At the end of the first book, when Susie fights Sneezer, there&#39;s sort of a Floating Hat effect (if that&#39;s not a trope, it should be) except it happens with a feather, since both Susie and Sneezer are wearing wings and are having an aerial battle.

            <p>I recently found a Mass Effect Marty Stu I&#39;d love to take down (time travelling badass soldier saves Shepard = cliches coming out of your ears) I&#39;ve held back because of the opening scene, where said Stu kills Osama bin Laden. My agents would have to save him in order to preserve continuity. (As found at <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6021452/1/A_Tale_of_two_Marines"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6021452/1/A_Tale_of_two_Marines">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6021452/1/A_Tale_of_two_Marines</a></a>)<br><br>Now, I would have no problem writing a scenario like this. It&#39;s only fiction, after all, and I would not actually rescue the man from a sniper bullet in real life. My fear is that having my agents save the most infamous terrorist in the world could cause a bit of an online kerfuffle.<br><br>This is not the only story I&#39;ve seen with RL villains playing major roles. &quot;If I Was Your Nazi&quot; springs immediately to mind.<br><br>How should I approach this? Should I even bother trying to approach this?</p>

            <p>The situation is really unrealistic. Bin Laden has proved a ridiculously hard enemy to catch; and the many, many Marines that have tried so far haven&#39;t managed it. Having the Stu catch Bin Laden is just not something that could actually happen; Bin Laden knows how much he is wanted and he is not the type to just go randomly walking out of buildings, without bodyguards, without protection, without disguise, without having checked for snipers.<br><br>I suggest you should have your agents go up to the dead bin Laden and find little more than a cardboard cutout, such as the sort people practice shooting at, and be disappointed that--shot by a Stu or not--he isn&#39;t real.</p>

            <p>Being dead in a badfic is the reason why he can&#39;t be found in real life.<br><br>I&#39;m with Neshomeh, if you don&#39;t want to deal with it, then don&#39;t. Usually there&#39;s enough charges in a fic to not have to deal with every tiny or major detail.<br><br>I skipped a chapter (and not mentioned it at all in the mission) a while ago because I was not in the mood to find out how FBI and NCIS interview minors. Can FBI tell they will be tried as an adult, or is that up to prosecution to decide? Can the minor legally weaver a lawyer or child advocate present during questioning? Or will the absence of both of these people get the case thrown out of court so fast the interviewers&#39; heads will spin?<br><br>I didn&#39;t feel like doing the research, or even know where to start (my hunch that the US has a decent enough legal system that protects minors from their own stupidity is only a hunch, and not good enough to form the basis of a charge). In the next chapter, happening simultaneously with the interview, the Sue kicked some ass and I thought that was a good time to just step into the fic and charge her.<br><br>---<br><br>I just remember a fic where the Sue claimed that she was given the order to assassinate someone in a motorcade. She quickly assumed it was Saddam. Agent Tasmin argued that was not possible, because two days before the fic was set the trial against Saddam had started. He therefore couldn&#39;t be at the place where the Sue said he would be. (Plus assassinating him while he&#39;s standing trial is terribly bad PR for the British military.)</p>

            <p>I have a few issues with this.<br><br>First of all, your bios are not very detailed. There is no mention of age, physical appearance, or gender, though I was able to guess that from the names. The bullet-point list isn&#39;t giving me very <i>much</i> information about their personalities - lust objects, weapons of choice and so on are barely mentioned. I feel like you haven&#39;t really fleshed them out. <br><br>There are several typos and grammatical or punctuation errors both in your bios and the writing sample. A few of the more glaring onces:<br>* <i>(I have no <b>dount</b> they&#39;ll take on more fandoms as I watch and read more.)</i><br>* <i>Of course <b>[the]</b> Rule of Flowers are Bastards will mean these&#39;ll show up too.</i><br>* You&#39;re also missing a lot of commas and, in a few cases, semi-colons. <br>This gives me the impression that you didn&#39;t take the time to re-read your submission before presenting it. Tell me, do you have a beta-reader?<br>(Also, this is the first I&#39;ve heard of a &quot;Rule of Flowers are Bastards&quot;. There is no such rule. Now, such things are find when in the dialogue of a grumpy agent - we&#39;re a sarcastic lot - but it doesn&#39;t really belong in bios.)<br><br>Your writing sample doesn&#39;t make me laugh. I know that&#39;s a terribly subjective thing to complain about, but a hundred-word paragraph describing the contents of someone&#39;s bag isn&#39;t particularly appealing. We ask for writing samples because, as the Permission article says, &quot;We want to see whether you can write well, basically.&quot; This isn&#39;t a fatal &#39;error&#39;, but it&#39;s not helping, either.<br><br>Content issues: <br>* HQ does not have an outside. It exists in a plothole, and only an entrance exists in World One. Your writing implies that PPC HQ is inside a real-world mountain, and whether or not that was your intention, it&#39;s wrong. You&#39;ll have to change it.<br>* We <i>do</i> have rather tight security. Talk to <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Security_Dandelions">the Dandelions</a> if you don&#39;t believe me. Simply leaning on a door will not gain entry. <br>* <i>(2). I may have misunderstood the idea behind HQ slightly.</i> Yes, I&#39;m afraid you have. The interior of PPC HQ does not resemble (let alone exist as part of) various fandom locations; it&#39;s all generic grey corridor and rooms, even though the plotholes themselves may be &#39;in&#39; various fandoms. <br><br>As I didn&#39;t read your writing sample last time, I cannot make comparisons there there, but my biggest discomfort comes from the fact that you don&#39;t seem to have a grasp on some of the PPC fundamentals, and that there are very few changes to your agent bios compared to the <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=198203;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board;pagemark=25">last time</a> you requested Permission.<br><br>For the moment, I&#39;m sorry: Permission denied. I&#39;ll ask other PGs for a second opinion, but for now, I&#39;d like to ask you to re-read <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/TOS">the Original Series</a> just to get a better grip on how they decided HQ works, and then re-write your writing sample. </p>

            <p>I&#39;m still not going to actually write for a while, but it&#39;s been a month (30 days and 35 minutes, to be exact), so it would be nice to get permission so I can feel more comfortable planning things.<br><br>My agents are in Improbable AU.  I&#39;m going to claim RC 808 for them.<br><br>Name: Kath<br><br>Species: Half elf, half human<br><br>Home continuum: Star Wars<br><br>Bio: Kath was a Mary Sue (based on one of my old characters, though you won’t find the story written down anywhere) in a story by an eleven-year-old (semi-fic blip).  She somehow got from Earth to the midst of Episodes V/VI and messed a bit with canon, mostly by rescuing Luke, though there was no actual romance involved.  She was recruited and had some basic retraining.<br><br>Powers/abilities/weapons: Weak Force power, some pyrotechnic abilities, very good fighter for no reason (her author said she taught herself), moderately good lightsaber user (despite having had no training, but to be fair, Luke had a ridiculously small amount), still has her lightsaber from her story.<br><br>Personality/preferences/quirks: Is annoyingly cheerful, will laugh at anything, is permanently energetic despite being an insomniac, is very extroverted, hates spiders, is claustrophobic, has a terror of being a Mary Sue, is a slight pyromaniac.  Is fairly ignorant about the Real World because knowledge of it was not written into her fic and retraining didn’t cover it.<br><br>Name: Elena<br><br>Species: Human<br><br>Home continuum: Real World<br><br>Bio: Elena wrote relatively good Star Wars and Young Wizards fanfiction for a while, then forayed into Lord of the Rings and got dragged to the OFUM.  She was kicked out of OFUM for coming up with a semi-plausible reason for ten walkers.  (I was really annoyed to see that it was used in a fic PPCed in the original series.  I knew I wasn’t the only one with this idea, but I didn’t know it had showed up in a fic, definitely not badfic.  Anyway, it’s explained terribly there, so I think I can still use it.)  The OFUM staff sent her to the Star Wars Fanfiction Academy because they were VERY angry at her but realized she hadn&#39;t done it maliciously enough to deserve something worse.  She somehow managed to graduate and receive a mini-Rancor named Anikin.  She went into PPCing Improbable AUs for Young Wizards.  Most of her job was getting rid of AU romance stories and original fiction and other miscellanea that was labeled as Young Wizards fanfiction by ignorant authors. (The latter more or less had to be entirely destroyed to keep them from trying to push their way into the YW continuum.)

            <p>It really was to be funny.  So I will take it out.  Not difficult.  I did want her to get to the SW OFU by some roundabout way, because just &quot;she wrote Star Wars badfic&quot; is boring (and nothing I wrote or ever will write in SW will be badfic, or not in the typical way), but I can&#39;t think of another... unless we decide that there isn&#39;t an OFU for Young Wizards for whatever reason (the characters are, literally, eternally too busy? No, doesn&#39;t make sense in the OFU universe, does it? Maybe not enough people write?) and they wanted her to go to some OFU and sent her to the next best.<br><br>She was from Earth, didn&#39;t I say that?  Though how she could possibly be half-elven and in present day time, I don&#39;t think even the author (me at age 11-12) figured out.  She&#39;s a MARY SUE.  Logic?!<br><br>The point is she speaks it a bit.  (Actually, it seems like a lot of humans don&#39;t understand it, but that&#39;s another discussion.)  She likely found an agent from that continuum who knew it.  Um, isn&#39;t that allowed?  Or can we only have as much of a language as was given in the books?  But if that were true, an agent who had previously spoken it would find that he/she/it couldn&#39;t upon coming to HQ, and that doesn&#39;t make sense.<br><br>Oh.  And I didn&#39;t consider whether people/creatures/objects from another continuum could understand it. *ponders* Or if that would be equivalent to using a noncanonical weapon (even if it&#39;s not as a weapon). *winces* But she could still say something to an object from the PPC, and I don&#39;t think she&#39;s quite done with PPCing Young Wizards yet.</p>

            <p>Even though <i>just &quot;she wrote Star Wars badfic&quot; is boring</i>, it&#39;s also normal - and the last thing we want to do is have our agents become speshul by having implausibly unusual backstories. If you want her to have an interesting background, why not think of some funny and (for her) embarrassing things that could have happened to her at the OFU?

            <p>As I said, I also don&#39;t like having her do something with the fandoms I&#39;m positive I wouldn&#39;t do.  I mean, my Star Wars OC is a bit powerful, but I really don&#39;t think I&#39;d get sent to the OFU for her.  I could imagine doing Young Wizards badfic, though, and LotR badfic would be easy.<br><br>Of course I&#39;d rather it not be truly implausible.  We know what that would make her.<br><br>That would save her from having to have a good theory.  She could also do something to really annoy the fangirls and get chased out by them.  What could that be? She does have a lust object - Glorfindel - so it couldn&#39;t just be not lusting.  She&#39;s not a trickster, either, so it can&#39;t be that.<br><br>She could have a sensible conversation with Legolas about something, which would make half the other students madly jealous.  Better if she (accidentally, of course) managed to make it Legolas and Aragorn.  And Elrond.  But I&#39;m not sure how that would happen.  They wouldn&#39;t politely listen to some theories she has about canon or ten walkers.  The idea of her trying to convince Legolas she&#39;s not a luster and actually wants to talk to him about something is even better than her trying to talk to Elrond, but I&#39;d need a logical topic.<br><br>You know, I really should have her be truly traumatized there so, more than just being embarrassed about what happened, she can actually be afraid of Lord of the Rings.  And that would make her relationship with her half-elf partner (already strained because she&#39;s a former Sue) even more difficult.  She was pretty unhappy at the Star Wars OFU, but if I could make the OFUM even worse...  *evil grin*  I will sleep on this and try to come up with some psychologically terrible or incredibly embarrassing things that could happen to her.<br><br>P.S.

            <p>You don&#39;t want to get too creative. It was just an off-the-cuff idea I had since I didn&#39;t want to dash your creativity entirely.

            <p>It would be really hard for her to pull that off.  Since I can&#39;t think of a reason why OFUM would be so awful for her (though it would be funny if she found her partner&#39;s elvishness disturbing), I&#39;ll give up on that.<br><br>But I did think of this: she could have written a SW-YW crossover.  It&#39;s stated in one of the YW books that SW was real, but I don&#39;t think the author tried to think of how that would work.  It wouldn&#39;t without messing with both canons.  That would be a way to get her to the SW OFU with it being something I would definitely do (I&#39;ve thought about this in detail before), and still make it more interesting than usual without making her speshul.  It would also connect her better to YW.<br><br>I have to know which OFU she went to because she has to have a mini.</p>

            <p>You&#39;re on your own with Improbable AU. There&#39;s not much at all and I&#39;ve never seen a mission published in that department (though they may exist and be lost). If you want to write in that department, you&#39;ll be doing a lot of defining on your own.<br><br>Personally, I&#39;d be in favor of moving the Department of Improbable AUs and turning it into a Division of the Department of Improbabilities (which does have missions in it), still headed by the Antigravity Apple as usual, and handling AUs as a specialty. (I&#39;d consolidate the DoWTF into the same department as a division thereof, if I had my way about it; but of course I haven&#39;t got any good reason to do it, so there it stays; and who said the PPC had to be logical?)<br><br>You are of course aware that your reformed Sue won&#39;t be able to use her lightsaber on most missions, unless she&#39;s in the Star Wars continuum or at least in a continuum where lightsaber-like swords exist.<br><br>I&#39;m a little worried about Elena&#39;s having come up with a Tenth Walker idea that actually made sense; more specifically, for having been expelled for it. I&#39;m not entirely sure that OFUM would do something like that; there are, in fact, Tenth Walker stories that do make sense, with the most probable tenth walkers being Arwen, Faramir, and possibly Bilbo (though the author who did that to the poor hobbit would probably have to be some kind of sadist).<br><br>At the most, I think OFUM would say, &quot;Okay. Write that story, and if it&#39;s crap, there are a lot of interesting ways to punish you...&quot; And if it got uncomfortable because the story was indeed decent and Elrond ended up using the Death Glare more often because people started thinking that this meant Tenth Walker stories were just fine (instead of &quot;treading on dangerous territory and requiring a lot of skill to ever pull off&quot;), your agent might have put in for a transfer to a different OFUM just because she had learned enough to love LotR canon and didn&#39;t like the idea of the proliferating Suefics that might result.<br><br>Not a PG, sorry, but good luck.</p>

            <p>Sorry, I thought you meant the D. of Improbabilities was headed by the Antigravity Apple.<br>It could get strange with two divisions.  It would have to be dept of improbabilities, AU division, Star Wars division.<br>Considering the number of departments we have, it seems like this should not be high on the list of consolidation needed.<br>Besides, crossover is its own department.  I realize that&#39;s a bit different because it&#39;s multiple continua, but still.<br>I&#39;d kind of like to get to basically create a department, but I&#39;m still a newbie, so I don&#39;t want to push it.</p>

            <p>I was trawling the depths of the HP section of ff.net when I cam across <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3171250/1/The_Girl_Who_Lived">thia</a> fic. It takes the old and tired trope of &quot;Harry Potter has a twin&quot;, and actually manages to do something with it that doesn&#39;t result in a Mary Sue. The twin- Katharine Potter -doesn&#39;t muck with the story (it starts out in first year), isn&#39;t all-powerful, and actually has (to me, anyways) a well-developed character that doesn&#39;t leech off Harry. Everyone&#39;s in character, there&#39;re a few ocs that are surprisingly well-written, and I found it a refreshing change from the normal drivel that has this tired trope in it. <br><br>Unfortunately, the fic&#39;s been on hiatus for a while, but at least someone made a rather good attempt at making a story like this believable.</p>

            <p>Although a lot of my original fics come from AU fanfic ideas. Eventually I decide, &quot;Screw it, this is too weird. Original!&quot; Sometimes it&#39;s even a not-so-implausible fanfiction idea, and I wind up with something I have to tweak heavily to avoid uncomfortable association with canon. (Or at least, a really common fanfiction idea. There&#39;s this one fandom I&#39;ve written for in which a ghost character is consistently resurrected. I did that, but wound up using an OC, so I switched his history around and made it original. I&#39;m rambling now; I think I&#39;ll stop.)</p>

            <p>The one I&#39;m working with at the moment keeps switching focus onto different secondary characters.

            <p>I see what you mean... So technically, my fic would count, seeing as it&#39;s set in modern times and all the canons have either died or gone to Valinor several millenia ago. On the other hand, I very much hope that my fic doesn&#39;t turn out to be full of &#39;Sues and &#39;Stus.</p>

            <p>I kind of expect there is something in the post for PGs (and others) to look at and decide about whether or not to grant permission.<br><br>Been around long enough is quite simple: if it&#39;s at least a month, it&#39;s long enough.<br>A little harder is whether you&#39;ve interacted enough. You should interact enough for PGs to remember your name, preferably in a good way.<br><br>Customary is to put up everything in one post: description of agents and writing sample.

            <p>I know your name, certainly, and I believe I looked at your Permission request last time, didn&#39;t I? (Sorry if it seems rude that I can&#39;t quite remember, but as you may have noticed, there are a <i>lot</i> of Permisison requests around.)<br><br>Anyway, at present, there are only four posts signed with your name on the first page of the Board (two of which are here), none on the second, and two on the third. That&#39;s not exactly a great deal of interaction. <br><br>Since you haven&#39;t actually posted your second request here, why not wait a little while (say a week? More or less at your discretion), work as much as you can on your writing sample, and make a point of interacting as much as you can around here - start a new thread if none of the existing topics hold your interest, and just chat. Then make a new post with all your agent bios, writing samples, et cetera - and don&#39;t forget to keep making posts! ;)  That should be enough to cover the &#39;interaction&#39; front quite nicely. </p>

            <p>In fandoms that have two canons there occasionally are characters that appear in one canon, but not in the other.<br><br>I&#39;ll work here with A-Team, because that&#39;s where I encountered the problem. In the movie there is a character named Charissa Sosa (wikipedia and Imdb seem to disagree on how many S&#39;s). She most definitely is not a character from the TV show.<br><br>Now, what to do when she some how shows up in TV verse based fic, and the author has misspells her name? Would that create a mini or an OC?<br><br>(I&#39;m in favour of a movie-verse mini, but mainly because I haven&#39;t got one, and minis are instant Rule of funny).</p>

            <p>Personally, I try to consider as many &#39;verses as possible to be part of the same canon - that is, if it&#39;s canonical somewhere, to treat it as such everywhere where there isn&#39;t a contradiction. So I&#39;d go with a normal mini.</p>

            <p>At what point is someone considered to be no longer active? Do they make a post saying that they&#39;re not going to be posting anymore, or is it after a certain amount of time has passed?<br><br>I&#39;m asking because I just read Paddlebrains&#39; User page, and was shocked to read that she isn&#39;t active anymore.

            <p>As the others have said, Pads is inactive because - in her own-ish words, her &#39;writing brain is fried&#39;. She&#39;ll probably be back whenever she gets inspiration again. But given that she&#39;s marked as inactive and has written a LOT more missions in the past year than I have, there&#39;s really no measure of it. <br><br>Generally speaking, if someone hasn&#39;t been seen on any of our community sites nor has posted in a mission in the past year, I&#39;d consider them in active, but there&#39;s nothing to say that any or all of them won&#39;t pop back in tomorrow. </p>

            <p>Right, I&#39;ve decided that before I join in the PPC, I&#39;m gonna try to interact more... but I tend to have trouble thinking of ways to start conversations.

Goodfic, of course!<br><br>The problem is, there are many fics out there, and I&#39;m not exactly sure what everyone here likes, so how about this: you folks recommend a continuum, and I&#39;ll dig up some links... maybe.<br><br>But first, here&#39;s some to start you off:<br><br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3735743/1/The_Moment_It_Began"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3735743/1/The_Moment_It_Began">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3735743/1/The_Moment_It_Began</a></a> - a good (if rather long) Harry Potter story showing how Severus Snape, when given the chance, is able to go back in time and turn his life around.<br><br>Here&#39;s some for any Gorillaz fans:<br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2916773/1/Remember_Me"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2916773/1/Remember_Me">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2916773/1/Remember_Me</a></a> - a heart-rending take on what happened after... a certain event.<br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3315543/1/A_Man_Out_Of_Time"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3315543/1/A_Man_Out_Of_Time">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3315543/1/A_Man_Out_Of_Time</a></a> - an odd story giving us some very interesting concepts...<br><br>And one more...<br><br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4439578/1/Kaiju_Moon"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4439578/1/Kaiju_Moon">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4439578/1/Kaiju_Moon</a></a> -  a Sailor Moon/Godzilla/Neon Genesis Evangelion crossover (no, really) that manages to be enthralling and amusing at the same time.<br><br>That&#39;s all I got for now.

            <p>:D<br><br>You&#39;ll never hear me complain about that. The Harry Potter one might be interesting.  Hmm, fandoms...<br><br>Well, depending on if you know them, I&#39;m quite fond of Star Trek TNG, DS9 and Voyager, Shrek, Monty Python, most of the classic Disney films, Practical Magic, the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen... and a lot more, but that&#39;s enough for now. None of those are fandoms I often (if ever) go and read fanfic for (often for fear of what they&#39;ve done to my characters), so if you know anything good for them, do let me know!</p>

            <p>It&#39;s nothing terribly huge, really - especially after reviewing TVTropes&#39;s page on Notability, which did a good job of shooting down one of my arguments, what I have to say really boils down to this: I think that if we list every trope that might apply to the PPC on the main PPC page, we&#39;ll very quickly loose the feel of the organization into the forest of tropes. A week ago, the page was 14,000 words long - bigger than Firefly&#39;s 11,000 and huge compared to the Star Trek TOS&#39;s 5000. I suppose it goes without saying that we&#39;ve had our fair share of newbies from TVTropes who were really excited about the PPC without really grasping the feel of the thing, so I would really appreciate it if we could try to keep the main page at least slightly sparse.<br><br>I&#39;m in a very similar boat to most of the people here, I suspect - I&#39;ve never seen a trope I didn&#39;t like (or didn&#39;t want to subvert), and the PPC, being metafiction, is a very nice platform for lampshade hanging. I&#39;m just trying to prevent a flood of misinformed newbies.</p>

            <p>One idea is that the agents have to pick which path the fic goes down, but then have a disagreement about where to go next, so they get separated in the story, have to collect charges separately, then unite again for the usual charging and assassinating.  It would be something different, anyway.</p>

            <p>In a manner which I shall discuss later, it has come to my attention that the Kudzu is mentioned as a &quot;he&quot; in the Original Series. This mention takes place in &quot;The Dark Elf&quot;, which is currently only accessible via the Wayback Machine, so I&#39;ve grabbed the relevant passages for you and highlighted the gender bit:<br><blockquote>
<i>What have you two brought me now?</i><br><br>&quot;Solaris, the Dark Elf.&quot;<br><br><i>She doesn&#39;t look particularly dark to me.</i><br><br>Acacia rolled her eyes. &quot;She claims she was given the title by the Rangers while she was posing as a man among them because she was so tough and killed a lot of stuff.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Which is stupid,&quot; Jay added. &quot;She doesn&#39;t seem to know what it means.&quot;<br><br><i>Enlighten me. Something to do with the Valar or Valinor, I cannot remember...</i><br><br>Acacia sighed. &quot;We have a Fictional Psych director who doesn&#39;t know the canon,&quot; she said sadly.<br><br>&quot;<font color="red">He</font> has to know ALL of them, Acy, at least the really important bits. <font color="red">He</font> can&#39;t know it all.&quot;<br><br>Acacia shrugged. &quot;Anyway it just means Elves who never went off to Valinor, and she seems to think it&#39;s really significant...&quot;<br><br>Solaris (who in the course of going to the Department of Fictional Psychology had in fact had to be gagged after all) glared.<br><br>Jay sighed deeply. &quot;At any rate, she has a good grasp of movie-verse canon, gets the lines right, and appears to have glanced at the book. Despite this, she is a first order Mary Sue who made the Men around her misogynists, and intended to breastfeed the fellowship.&quot;<br><br>The Director looked astonished. Or might have. It was hard to tell, with vines.<br><br><i>Please repeat that? I don&#39;t believe I heard correctly...</i><br><br>Jay repeated what she had said exactly, only a little more slowly.<br><br>&quot;And she had decent grammar for the longest time, and then did horrible tense-shifting at the walls of Moria,&quot; Acacia added.<br><br>The Kudzu looked at the Sue not with horror, but with a dreadful curiosity.<br><br><i>I can see why you chose to bring her to me.</i> Vines reached out to ensnare Solaris. <i>Lie down on the couch, my dear.</i><br><br>Jay and Acacia beat a hasty retreat towards the door.</blockquote>
<br>So, there you go. Now, my feeling is that three to five years ago, when this story was still accessible on Odd Lots and before/right after I started writing about FicPsych, would have been a really good time for someone to point this out to me, but now it&#39;s shutting the barn door after the horse has gone. I missed it, which is embarrassing, but so did everybody else at the time. I can handwave it away easily by saying that the Kudzu, as a sentient vine, doesn&#39;t truly have gender as we know it, so maybe it just decided to make a change since that mention. However, it&#39;s really up to all of you to decide what happens now. TOS <i>is</i> canon, so if you all really want me to slog through every mention of the Kudzu as female over the last few years and change it, I can do that. Either way, please speak up. Just because someone else has said what you meant to say is not a reason to keep quiet in a vote, which this is.<br><br>---<br><br>There is one other issue I want to bring up here, and that is the way in which this thing was brought to my attention: someone went on the Wiki and edited the Kudzu&#39;s page. They weren&#39;t logged in. They didn&#39;t bother dropping me a line about it as the person it most affects. They didn&#39;t bother mentioning it to you guys, either. Personally, I don&#39;t think that&#39;s okay. I think that was underhanded and rude.<br><br>Now, if they had been logged in, I could be having this conversation privately with the individual involved, and I could possibly be more understanding, since I would have some sense of where they were coming from. As it is, all I can do is try to impress upon all of you to log in when you edit the Wiki. Not doing so is like wearing a mask in a public place: it&#39;s suspicious and it makes me, at least, feel very uncomfortable. It is not hard to know whether or not you&#39;re logged in, so don&#39;t try &quot;I didn&#39;t know&quot; as an excuse--all you have to do is scroll up to the top of the page and see if your username is up there or if it&#39;s prompting you to log in. If you&#39;re afraid of getting logged out while editing, make sure to use the &quot;Preview&quot; function before you save (which you should do anyway), or set it to remember you when you log in.<br><br>It&#39;s this sort of thing that makes me wish we could enforce logging in in order to make edits at all, but since we can&#39;t, please, please have some respect for the community and identify yourself when you edit.<br><br>That&#39;s all. Don&#39;t forget to say what you want to happen re. the Kudzu.<br><br>Thanks,<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Now that this has been completely overshadowed by more recent threads...<br><br>Looks to me like everyone who responded either a) abstained or b) is okay with the idea that Flowers&#39; genders are fairly arbitrary, except maybe in a few notable circumstances where it would be weird to suddenly switch the pronouns.

            <p>I have to agree with Techno-Dann&#39;s scientific assessment.  The kudzu is a plant, so at any given time, different parts of its body are male or female, so either pronoun assigned to it is equally correct. (Or equally incorrect?)<br><br>As for Wikis, the three I&#39;m active on (ours, Bulbapedia and TV Tropes) seem to log me out every couple of months or so, but logging back in only takes a handful of seconds, and then I&#39;m set for another sixth of a year.

            <p>I like the idea that gender in Flowers is just assumed. Maybe it is for the psychological response the particular gender garners from the agents (which would also explain the idea that different agents have different impressions of some Flowers gender). No matter how much we may bemoan it, in our modern society, males are still typically seen as more authoritative than females, so the Sunflower Official and Marquis de Sod take on strongly male personas, because that is the effect they are trying to project. The kudzu may have decided to take on a female persona to come across as more warm and caring to aide its work in FicPsych. <br><br>Thinking out loud here: Maybe it would seem male to a canon character or agent recruit traumatized by a Sue, because for that character the female persona wouldn&#39;t be trusted as much. Whereas a Grrl power character might perceive even the Sunflower Official as female. I agree with the others. I could see these kinds of perception differences making for interesting conversations.<br><br>Overall, I support leaving the wiki page with all female gender references, because that is how she is referred to most of the time. However that gender assignment came about.</p>

            <p>Like most Flowers, physically, the Kudzu is both male and female.<br><br>Actually, there&#39;s a human parallel: The difference between physical and mental gender. While most people have a set physical and a set mental gender that match each other, there are quite a few whose mental and physical genders don&#39;t match, or whose mental and/or physical gender is ambiguous. For example, you might be physically female, mentally androgynous; or physically androgynous, mentally male; or any combination; or even change somewhat as your personality changes.<br><br>Those configurations are the minority for humans; but what about Flowers? Most plants (including kudzu) are both genders at once. Maybe the Flowers&#39; gender is simply more fluid than human gender. Maybe, instead of a small minority having no particular gender, both at once, or changing gender, that&#39;s actually the norm for Flowers. Maybe gender doesn&#39;t really matter to them very much--would mental gender matter very much to you, if you came from a species where anyone could reproduce with anyone else?<br><br>It&#39;s entirely possible that the only reasons the Flowers have genders at all is that they deal with two-gendered species so often--species who insist on assigning them gendered pronouns. (It doesn&#39;t help that English doesn&#39;t have a very good pronoun for an ambiguously gendered person. &quot;It&quot; sounds like an object; &quot;they&quot; is bad grammar. And English is probably the predominant language at HQ because it is the predominant language on World One.) It could be that for the Flowers, a gender is about as important to them as our hair colors or our names are to us--something that you associate with yourself, and other people see you as; but something that really isn&#39;t all that fundamental to who you are.<br><br>BTW, I didn&#39;t edit the Kudzu&#39;s page, but I may be part of the problem, since I was the one who added the link to &quot;The Dark Elf&quot; on Jay&#39;s and Acacia&#39;s wiki pages...</p>

            <p>As July and Dann have said, there are ways to explain it, And personally, I&#39;ve always thought of the Flowers&#39; genders are more or less arbitrary choices on their parts (therefore there being no &#39;wrong&#39; pronoun), and also, it&#39;s always possible that an agent simply gets it wrong. Sacriligious though this may sound, Jay could&#39;ve just made a &#39;mistake&#39; (speaking within the fourth wall, of course). </p>

            <p>I think it makes a lot of sense to keep it a mystery-- Agents refer to it as a he or she based on, as has been said, personal projection. It&#39;s more fun that way! It could be a soure of inter-departmental gossip, and curiosity, with the Flower itself carefully never giving unwarranted clues-- or contradictory clues. I like the idea of the Flowers being mostly amused by our need to assign gender to them.<br><br>On the Wiki: agreed.</p>

            <p>Would just like to say that at times it is hard to log in. For instance, I&#39;ve made several visits to the wiki in the past week or so where the log in button simply disappears after the page has loaded.<br><br>--<br><br>I&#39;ve noticed people get quite upset when someone has made changes to a page they consider their own. Isn&#39;t the point of the wiki that others can change those pages too?<br><br>If you don&#39;t want anonymous users to change the wiki then have the whole thing looked for registered users only, like the front page is.</p>

<li>Even if you can&#39;t log in, you can leave a comment identifying yourself.<br><br>2. Yes, other people can edit the pages, and when it comes to general cataloging, like adding links to missions or tidbits of information, that&#39;s fine. The problem here is that KG wasn&#39;t adding information so much as altering it, and since this change (if we decide it sticks) affects me and my past, present, and future PPC writing directly, I would have liked some notice before he went ahead and switched it.<br><br>Suppose someone arbitrarily went and changed every instance of &quot;agent&quot; to &quot;constable&quot; because that&#39;s how Jay and Acacia were referred to in the early OS missions. That would be annoying to everyone for the same reason this was annoying to me, I think.<br><br>In this case, I don&#39;t contest the validity of the point (which is why I brought it up for a vote), just the way it was handled.<br><br>As for locking the pages: as July points out, it&#39;s a rather Herculean task at this point, since we would have to do each page individually. Furthermore, I&#39;d do no such thing without notifying and getting the approval of the Board first. {= p<br><br>~Neshomeh</li>

            <p>as a &quot;if you have such a problem with anonymous edits, why don&#39;t you just...&quot; Hey, I like it too when people log in so I can tell who made the edits. It helps with the community feeling. But if other people aren&#39;t feeling particularly communal, that&#39;s up to them. I don&#39;t like this &quot;people must log in so they can answer to me&quot; vibe that seems to me hanging around here.<br><br>Had you left a note on the Kudzu&#39;s page that you wanted to be notified of edits? Or that you didn&#39;t like edits? I believe it was you who suggested to Rilwen to do this when she blew a gasket when someone editted one of her agents&#39; pages. Personally, I&#39;m not completely familiar with who writes about what flower and who should thus be notified when older information conflicts with newer information.<br><br>Herculean task: seems impossible but with a little wit and ingenuity doable.</p>

Flowers are community property; thus, any changes to what&#39;s established about them needs to be brought up with the community--preferably here, but a note on the Talk page first would have done, as well.

If there&#39;s a typo, feel free to fix it, but I draw the line at changing the fundamental content and/or structure of existing sentences, and I reserve the right to re-work anything anyone else does to suit me--as may you all on your agents&#39; pages.<br><br>The issue with Rilwen&#39;s pages, by the way, was that none of the information on them was altered--only links were added--and she got very nasty with her language, which is never okay.

            <p>On the side of the Agents and Boarders.<br><br>While person Y might think &quot;Oh, this Flower is definitely a male&quot; person Z might privately think that that Flower seems to be more a female to them. Since as far as I can tell, we pretty much assign the gender pronouns we use for each Flower somewhat randomly, going by whatever whoever wrote it first concluded when they first started that character.<br><br>It could always depend on the personalities of the Flowers themselves, as well, if they notice or mind our silly use of gender pronouns for all of them. I&#39;d  suspect, for one, that while the poor Daisy would really care either way, the Marquis or the S.O. might flutter their petals in annoyance at being called female or a &#39;she&#39;, and I suspect the Queen Anne&#39;s Lace wouldn&#39;t exactly be amused either at being called a &#39;he&#39; as well.<br><br>In short, I don&#39;t see anything wrong with you referring to the Kudzu in your work as a &#39;she&#39;, while the use of &#39;he&#39; is notable in TOS.<br><br>We&#39;re anthropomorphizing flowers after all, and the key thing to that is perception and opinion- which could always lead to a hilarious moment in a spin off, if two groups who have different opinions on what gender certain flowers are met and argued about it-, and it&#39;s not there aren&#39;t other spinoffs that ignore things set as &#39;canon&#39; by Jay and Acacia.<br><br><br><br>______________<br><br><br>On the subject of the Wiki, I agree that people seriously, seriously, need to log in or at least state who they are when editing to prevent people from thinking it&#39;s trolling or otherwise. It&#39;s not very hard to put a wrong fact in somewhere and have people be fooled by it. That should also go for people who use different usernames on the wiki as compared to the board, so they can be recognized as not a random person editing the whole thing into their private view.</p>

And as a not-quite-so rabid example of the fandom, I&#39;m willing to concede that the Ronald/Hermione relationship could have worked... with a few tweaks.  Say... beginning of book 5, it becomes obvious that Ron is no longer mis-pronouncing the names of common Muggle devices, that he&#39;s gotten the hang of decimalization and the New Pound.. he&#39;s even gotten intellectually curious.<br><br>That&#39;s the kind of fanfic I&#39;m looking for: where Ron realizes his feelings and actually begins to try and improve himself, in fits and starts, with old habits and ingrained prejudices dying a lingering death.<br><br>But failure is not an option here.<br><br>Aditionally, my preferred fic of this type would NOT have Harry paired with Ginny.  I&#39;m sorry, but for some reason I get a weird incest vibe from it (my own bit of fanon is that they&#39;re Irish Twins and the whole thing was memory charmed out of existence).  To wit, either a successful thing with Cho Chang or something with Luna might be nice.<br><br>So... any suggestions? </p>

            <p>I&#39;ve just read the wiki page about cycle theory, and in response, I would like to announce that it is BULLOCK! Let me make myself understood implicitly - I am a proponent of Cycle Theory, in that I know it is happening, but I&#39;m opposed to it in that I think it shouldn&#39;t be happening. Regression is the worst possible thing that could happen to the PPC, yes, even worse than our total destruction. If we are destroyed, Bad Things will happen due to our absence, but if we regress to the early days of the Organization, we will be the cause of Bad Things, and they will Not be Funny!<br><br>First, the issuing of the TARDISes. This changes the entire focus of the Agent of the PPC, from someone who does their job as best they can in the field, who isn&#39;t afraid to get their hands dirty or improvise, sponsered and organized lunatics who can get in and out of any amount of trouble just so long as it&#39;s funny, to shadowy figures, lurking in their TARDISes and &#39;fixing&#39; whatever parts of fanfiction they don&#39;t like. It&#39;s creepy, it&#39;s uncomfortably sterile, it&#39;s not as funny, (Think about some of the problems Jay and Acacia faced in the OS. Would they have been as funny if their RC was five steps away?) and it wouldn&#39;t work. Think about it; If our agents were as psychotic as we make them out to be, and they had to stay in an enclosed space with someone just as disturbed for such prolonged periods of time, where their only chance to get out involves killing things...How long would it take for those police boxes to begin dripping blood?<br><br>In an RC, you can call for help. In a Tardis, no one can hear you scream.<br><br>The Sun Crushers and Mass Neuralyzers are also a problem. They give Agent&#39;s more freedom, freedom that they really shouldn&#39;t be allowed. It gives more opportunities to take the easy way out. Why slice off a &#39;Sue&#39;s head when you can hit her with an antitank weapon? And who cares if the canons noticed? Turn on the Mass Neuralyzer and it won&#39;t matter at all. This isn&#39;t funny, and this isn&#39;t what the PPC should be. I&#39;m 80% sure that we have rules against this, and if we don&#39;t, we should. <br><br>Our rules are also being compromised. Yes, we argue about them like a trio of Ashkenazi Rabbis. Yes, our agents barely every follow them even when we do manage to agree. But we have them, there are reasons that we have them, and we are currently making a mockery of them. And it isn&#39;t even an amusing mockery.<br><br>It seems that we&#39;ve lost focus. What are we, what is our purpose? Are we enforcing canon or quality? If we&#39;re just enforcing canon, does that mean that we kill any fic that doesn&#39;t follow the books to the letter? If we&#39;re enforcing quality, what&#39;s the difference between that and bashing stuff that we don&#39;t like? <br><br>No. We&#39;re not doing either. We&#39;re writing these missions to be funny and interesting, because we are the goddamn PPC. That is the goddamn <i>point</i> of the entire organization, and we are missing it completely. In HQ, Rule of Funny is Word of God. Sometimes we need to be serious, but when we do we should beware of blowing this seriousness out of proportion. Angst should be kept to a minumum, and the same goes for plotline. The point of this is to have fun with the plots of badfic, not to create monolithic storylines and backstories for each individual agent. And the Grey Lady knows that we don&#39;t need a full-blown Emergency to write a decent fight scene. <br><br>This may appear to have nothing to do with regression. But think about it this way; the OS is the foundation on which all of the PPC is built. This means that we&#39;re supposed to build on it, progress and improve what they created, not tear it down because we think we can do better.<br><br>I&#39;m probably just rambling here. In fact, I&#39;m almost certain that I am. But I, for one, want to know what people think about this, if this is a problem that needs to be fixed, and how we might go about changing this.<br><br>Overthinking things as usual, EBW</p>

            <p>... Sambar&#39;s wrong (I should know; he&#39;s mine). The PPC <i>isn&#39;t</i> going to degenerate into a planet-destroying network of uncaring wossnames, simply because that&#39;s not even a story. I can demonstrate what those missions would look like by pointing you to my &quot;friend&quot; <a href="http://www.freewebs.com/fanfic_land/Story49.htm">Jaycacia Thornbyrd</a>:<br><br><i>The first thing she saw on arrival was, naturally enough, a Mary-Sue. Using her secret powers, given to her at birth by a wandering daffodil, she deleted the ‘Sue from the story. Any other Assassin, having killed the ‘Sue – by normal means, as only Jaycacia had the power to alter the story at will – would have expected the Canon to snap back, but Jaycacia was not fooled. There were still thirteen more ‘Sues, along with a host of Cute Animal Friends, to destroy. <br><br>So destroy them she did. Standing there in the clearing, Jaycacia stretched out and, with a fraction of her powers, deleted the uncanons one by one. Once she was satisfied that the story was fixed, she opened a portal back to HQ using the power of her mind – no need for silly Remote Activators – and stepped back into her room.</i><br><br>If that was what missions turned into, no one would write them, and there would be no PPC.<br><br>Oh, and yes, it was a joke article, but written as a gentle warning that things might be getting a bit over the top. Which seems to have worked.<br><br>And have you seen <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Catastrophe_Theory">Catastrophe Theory</a>?<br><br>hS, just bobbing in and out</p>

            <p>It depends on whether anyone&#39;s able to help me. I&#39;m rather a busy bee right now, and updating FfL is a fairly intensive job for the few days it lasts. If someone can volunteer to make a daily collection of updates (with all relevant details - username, user number if applicable, story/chapter title, reviews etc, and date of posting, plus the actual text) to email to me, then yes. Or if someone wants to brave the perils of my idiosyncratic HTML and update it themselves, then also yes.

            <p>It would take a while in either case, but the new entries don&#39;t need to go up on FfL while we&#39;re playing the game, I think - do they?

            <p>What you&#39;re describing is essentially the same issue as came up late last year, when there was a rather tense conflict on the Board and the oldbies collectively put their foot down on the entire Emergencies problem - it&#39;s also why I wrote the <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Guide_To_The_PPC">Guide To The PPC</a>, which has an entire section on exactly this issue. <br><br>I really hope this debate doesn&#39;t start up again, because frankly, we&#39;ve heard it before. In short, everyone&#39;s keeping an eye out for missions and other writings that are losing the PPC &#39;spirit&#39; and becoming too powerful, particularly the PGs when they give Permission. We&#39;re being vigilant. Within the word world, most agents do not have access to these powerful tools anyway, and those who do and abuse the use of them tend to be singled out by the Flowers for brain-breaking assignments. It&#39;s now they keep order in HQ.<br><br>Also, I might point out that the Cycle Theory article <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/index.php?title=Cycle_Theory&amp;action=history">hasn&#39;t been updated for almost a year</a>, which is before all this began, so strictly speaking, it&#39;s out of &#39;date&#39; with regards to this particular discussion. Let me also quote the editing note made when the page was first created: <br><br>&quot;<i>Because if there&#39;s one thing the PPC needs, it&#39;s another insane theory.</i>&quot;<br><br>To me, that seems to imply that only the insane agents (in fact, only ONE agent - Sambar of Finance) who believe in said theory. I doubt it&#39;s therefore something that should be taken very seriously, let alone be the cause of a Board-wide dispute. <br><br>- Sedri, wearing her Boarder Hat<br><br><br>Also, I would ask you to kindly tone down your &#39;rant&#39; next time something upsetting comes up. Calm down before you post and please present it as an argument for discussion rather than throwing around final statements like &quot;it is _!&quot; and &quot;it wouldn&#39;t work&quot;, which leave no room for opinion and can hurt people&#39;s feelings.<br><br>- Sedri, wearing her Relative-Oldbie and Hopefully-Respect-Worthy-PG Hat</p>

            <p>Have you been reading recent missions? It&#39;s evident that most people agree with you.<br><br>Recent agents don&#39;t have TARDISes; nor do they use Mass Neuralyzers; and it doesn&#39;t make sense that they should. Nobody else liked being overpowered, either.<br><br>Why? Simple: Glitter levels. An overly powerful PPC agent ends up Sued, and then their own partner (or the DIO, which doesn&#39;t exist) has to take them out. It&#39;s not fun, and while it&#39;s &quot;never happened&quot;, we don&#39;t want it to ever happen. It&#39;s not necessarily even the way that most agents would want it; very few agents are actually sociopathic enough to want to go killing at random without checking first to see that their target is a personality-free, canon-destroying Sue. And that means they&#39;d prefer that other agents not go on killing sprees, either.<br><br>The agents need to keep their distance from the canons, sure; but the SEP fields and the constant presence of a partner are usually enough to ensure that. Equally dangerous would be keeping too much distance from the canons--too much distance to care about the characters, understand the continuum, or notice the small details that can be crucial on a mission.<br><br>On the writer&#39;s side, we don&#39;t want our agents to be overly powerful, either, because it&#39;s no longer fun to write for them. It&#39;s like having Superman as your main character; only he lives in a world where the worst crimes are purse-snatchings and shoplifting and nobody ever thought of becoming a supervillain. In a word: Boring.<br><br>Bringing in the big guns isn&#39;t necessary unless it&#39;s absolutely warranted. That&#39;s one of the reasons why I think the PPC should continue to maintain, and train pilots for, Sun Crushers. There will always be sci-fi continua in which the fangirls will write extracanonical solar systems; and there has to be a way to deal with them. But Sun Crushers are no good for any other purpose. With a few hundred agents (give or take a few thousand) who are all dedicated to protecting their favorite continua, there&#39;s absolutely no way the PPC will go back to just blowing up any planet with a Sue on it. Would you like it if they blew up Middle-earth because it was such a Sue magnet? Do I hear the phrase &quot;over my dead body&quot;? Thought so.<br><br>The Mass Neuralyzer, however, seems to be something that probably isn&#39;t a good idea. Yes, it&#39;s efficient; but it&#39;s impersonal, and you&#39;re likely enough to accidentally neuralyze someone hiding outside the radius of your vision. Consider the scenario: You&#39;re in Rivendell and you&#39;ve just neuralyzed the entire Fellowship with a Mass Neuralyzer. Your neuralyzer flash was seen through the window by five Random Elves and Bilbo Baggins. They now all think they are part of the Fellowship. Is this good for canon? Nope.<br><br>What I do disagree with, though, is the idea that we shouldn&#39;t be writing stories that flesh out our agents&#39; personalities, or writing stories that have a plot beyond just &quot;See badfic, see Sue, kill Sue&quot;. Plot and characterization are both good. The PPC is not MSTing; if you want to just spork badfic, plot-free, you should be writing an MST. Your characters should be realistic people, and the reader should care what happens to them. That doesn&#39;t mean you have to pile on the melodrama. When I say &quot;plot&quot;, I&#39;m talking about things like someone getting hurt, or the Sufficiently Advanced Technology frizting out, or the Warrior!Sue turning out to be a little too Warrior-y for the agents&#39; taste. Things should happen other than just sporking the plot of the badfic. Large-scale emergencies? No. But bringing in another agent pair for backup, or having a food fight in the Cafeteria, or RPing a romance with another agent? Not Emergency material.</p>

            <p>Are you trying to imply that the unhinged, unstable lunatics that are agents are realistic in any way, shape or form? <br><br>That clearly isn&#39;t the case from how I see it. Yes, their personalities are fleshed out, but they don&#39;t seem very natural to me. Of course, insanity does come into play a bit, but even the most insane lunatic is going to be scared (insert term for fecal matter here)-less when near something that can kill them or worse with as little as a thought or can control them like puppets with little hope of escape.<br><br>What I see are a bunch of highly exaggerated, apparently &quot;insane&quot; freaks who are using their insanity as an excuse to get away with things that no normal person could get away with.<br><br>I&#39;m not saying that the crazy, over-the-top agents are a bad thing.

            <p>I&#39;ll also add that the agents undergo situations no real person has ever suffered, so you can only guess how their thought processes during and after the incidents would work. Some of them are pretty SIMILAR to real situations, e.g. it&#39;s possible to look up the effects of drunkenness and sleep deprivation, but no real person has become addicted to drinking bleach, had their physical sex abruptly swapped, or been demonically possessed. I&#39;d say most of the agents are reacting in perfectly reasonable ways to the craziness they face every day.</p>

            <p>... Some Real World faiths do believe in demonic possession, and I didn&#39;t mean to offend anyone who belongs to one of those faiths when I said &quot;nobody&#39;s ever been demonically possessed&quot;. I could have phrased that better; nobody&#39;s ever been officially proven to be demonically possessed.

Maybe I just need to read more of the current spin-offs (well, actually, that point&#39;s not up for debate; I do), but if you really think the PPC is so terrible, I hate to say it, but why are you here? It was always about a bunch of crazy misfits doing crazy things that, yes, no normal person could get away with. But I don&#39;t think anyone on this &#39;Board believes in normality anyway. (Do you? I speak for myself, here. Maybe you guys do. I have to doubt it, though.) The PPC-focused bit aside, that still crossed a line. Maybe I&#39;m just being touchy, but &quot;using insanity as an excuse to get away with things that no normal person could&quot; strikes a nerve for me. There&#39;s no &quot;It&#39;s okay for ME to do this, because I&#39;M CRAAZYYY!&quot; in the PPC. It&#39;s more &quot;Hey, I&#39;ll do this because it doesn&#39;t bother me!&quot; &quot;...Rooting around in pink, glittery blood, looking for specific organs doesn&#39;t bother you? That&#39;s a little strange. You might be crazy.&quot;<br><br>Again, maybe I just need to read more spin-offs. You could be right; I just doubt it rather highly.<br><br>Also? The humor is the point. It&#39;s satire. It&#39;s making something humorous out of something relatively serious (well, not -really-. But kind of). That&#39;s why we&#39;re here.<br><br>So... yes. The unhinged, unstable lunatics that are our agents are realistic. In most ways, if not shapes and forms (I mean, come on. We&#39;ve got elves, aliens, and anthropomorphic animals-- shapes and forms are Willing Suspension of Disbelief).</p>

            <p>Did you know that legal insanity is partly based on the concept that the person would have committed the same acts even if they were standing right next to a cop?<br><br>Insanity in that case actually precludes the ability to react to normal stimuli in normal ways. The really insane agents, in fact should not be capable of be scared (blank)less.<br><br>But I really haven&#39;t noticed anyone being over the top wildly insane (and most of them have shown that they are capable of fear). I see the reactions to be similar to the gallows humor that allows morticians to joke about dead bodies, or trauma surgeons to joke about blood, or soldiers to joke about war. It is a pretty normal human reaction to make light of situations that have high risks of psychological or physical trauma.<br><br>You&#39;re also leaving out all those agents who are not World One humans. I actually don&#39;t have a single World One human between my four agents. Two of them aren&#39;t human, and one of the ones who is, is from a continuum where it is perfectly normal to have mild super powers and to expect Doom From Above in the form of super villains. Anyway, my point is that expecting these characters to react in normal World One ways is wrong for the characters involved.<br><br>I think I have a coherent point in there, maybe.</p>

            <p>Our agents are a little unhinged, but none of them that I have read would be &quot;legally insane&quot; except when they are actually being dragged (kicking, screaming, and possibly wielding a flamethrower) to FicPsych because they&#39;re no longer capable of acting as agents.<br><br>If they&#39;re in the field (and not currently in need of being dragged anywhere), then they are capable of understanding what they are doing, understanding right and wrong, and making decisions. That&#39;s not legally insane.<br><br>You&#39;ve got to be a little nuts to go into badfic and set things right. It&#39;s a survival mechanism. And it&#39;s actually quite realistic. How do people cope with tough things in real life? That&#39;s right: We go a little nuts. We escape to fantasy worlds by playing games or reading books. We get sarcastic and cynical and joke about things that no sane person would joke about. We pretend things haven&#39;t changed, even though we know they have. We get hypervigilant; we get addicted; we get obsessive.<br><br>That&#39;s what everyday humans do. Under stress, we get just a little crazy. Now take that, satirize it, use it for humor. Apply it to people with a tough, extremely risky job. And you get the PPC.<br><br>Too much stress, and you get somebody with a diagnosable mental illness; and their functioning level starts to go down. Real-life people can snap, too; and while we don&#39;t get out flamethrowers (are, in fact, no more likely to be violent than the most sane guy on the planet), we do end up unable to do our jobs. But that isn&#39;t the everyday insanity that we use to cope with life.<br><br>Bottom line: Everybody&#39;s a little crazy. It&#39;s how we cope.</p>

            <p>And yet another reason why the PPC isn&#39;t (and wasn&#39;t really even during TOS) about &quot;See badfic, see Sue, kill Sue.&quot; Sometimes there&#39;s no Sue in the first place!<br><br>What it is about is simply putting the canon right again, fixing what&#39;s horribly wrong, and being a fun thing for those of us who&#39;ve ever had to search through the badfic looking for the good. The Bad Slash department gets every bit as much horribly-wrong as DMS--probably more, come to think of it.<br><br>Anyway, DBS has to fight insanity same as anyone else does; and it&#39;s not like exorcists don&#39;t occasionally get possessed by the odd escaping slashwraith.<br><br>Other departments who may have Sue-free missions: Implausible Crossovers, Despatch, Angst, DAVD, the Troll Division, DOGA, and (obviously) Floaters.<br><br>It started with Sues, branched out into implausible crossovers, then added bad slash. From there, we&#39;ve had plenty of places where the more pacifistic agents can go. There&#39;s just so much more to badfic than Mary Sue.<br><br>(My personal opinion on the assassination/killing thing: Mary Sues are not &quot;people&quot; unless you insist on putting anything vaguely people-shaped into that category. With such cliched characterization and lack of personality, the average Mary Sue has little more than a basic set of &quot;chase Lust Object&quot; reflexes to serve as a brain.)</p>

            <p>Might as well tell you my opinion on sues being &quot;people&quot;, like I have much better to do right now...<br><br>From how I understand it, sues aren&#39;t dumb or just humanoids with cockroach intelligence, they&#39;re just so used to their rather simplistic routine of the words given to them inside their fic that they&#39;re just deathly afraid of breaking it, and almost incapable of acting outside of them without seeming awkward.<br><br>This is why I try to portray them a little more innocently than most people do in my PPC writings/rough drafts. They have the potential to be so much more (actually good, well designed characters and sentient) but most of them are just fine with wasting their potential and not having to put up with anything in their lives ever as opposed to actually going out there and coming out of their shell of powers and popularity.<br><br>...Yeah, it&#39;s kind of weird.</p>

            <p>...any more than the elements that make up a human being are the same thing as the human himself. We&#39;re a bunch of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, with a bit of nitrogen and calcium and other random elements thrown in... But go to your local lab and pick the elements out of their containers, shake them up, and you won&#39;t get a human; you&#39;ll probably just get a blob of random stuff (and quite possibly explosions). What makes a human isn&#39;t the elements in our bodies; it&#39;s the information that ties them together.<br><br>Sues are fictional characters. They&#39;re made of words. But in their case, they&#39;re not full characters; they&#39;re just a bunch of words thrown together without much coherence. They&#39;re little better than a blob of chemicals, with the same ingredients as a good character but very little of the information. Fictional characters, even more than human beings, are made of information. And for the Sue, that information is so cliched and mixed-up that nothing sentient could possibly result. Take the same words and put them together a different way; use good characterization; trim the extra Sue traits; and yeah, you could have a good character. But you don&#39;t have one now, any more than a blob of chemicals is the same thing as a human being.</p>

            <p>I can see your points, and they&#39;re quite valid...<br><br>... And I kind of agree with you on them. Some of the things we&#39;re putting into our PPC stories aren&#39;t funny and/or interesting, they&#39;re downright stupid, lazy and cheap. It&#39;s almost like we&#39;ve started defiling <i> our own writing, our own canon, our own characters </i> just to protect the things we love. It&#39;s disgusting in my opinion, and this is coming from the guy who can&#39;t write humor for his life!<br><br>I haven&#39;t been here in this community for long, and I already see that we&#39;re losing what our whole point was originally. We&#39;ve became kind of divided, with some people still in it mostly for fun and laughs, just trying to have a good time more than anything else, but with others taking this more seriously and trying to explain and expand the fictional universe of the PPC because it means something personal to them somehow. (I&#39;m one of the latter, mostly because I&#39;ve ended up becoming attached to my agents despite not even getting permission yet, but also because I don&#39;t really write humor to begin with). There isn&#39;t anything wrong with either in moderation, but it seems that there&#39;s a lot more of the second group now than the first one than there used to be.<br><br>What we need to find is balance. Not too serious, but not too funny either. What we are is lost, incapable of realizing that we&#39;re tearing our whole beloved fictional world apart because we&#39;re trying to resist change a bit too much to be healthy. We&#39;re attempting to enforce both canon and quality, but we&#39;ve leaked into enforcing what we think is bad a little as well. This is kind of visible on the wiki, as well. A (possibly somewhat bad) example is on the Pokemon page. Look under the &quot;Sue types&quot; section and you&#39;ll see that pokemorphs are for some reason grouped up in there despite there actually being some good &#39;morph characters out there if you look hard enough. Yes, 90 percent of them are canon defiling, biology defying wrecks that deserve to die by (insert hilarious method of execution here), but just because someone writes an idea that&#39;s been done horribly over and over and over doesn&#39;t mean that the character is immediately a sue. There&#39;s using an overused idea poorly, and there&#39;s using it right despite everyone else expecting something horrible just because everyone else is using it badly. Kind of getting a little off topic here, though, so I&#39;m gonna stop ranting.<br><br>...Or maybe I&#39;m just rambling on again because I see another wall of text, and my brain wants to make another wall. I dunno, it&#39;s kind of hard to tell. Hopefully I wrote all this to get a valid point across, because I can&#39;t tell any more.<br></p>

            <p>..but I have one issue.  The point in question is the &quot;Pokemorphs&quot; example.<br><br>I understand what you are saying there, not all pokemorphs are bad.  I agree with you on that.  However, it is not under Mary Sue types because it is always bad, it is under there because, as you said, &quot;90 percent of them are canon defiling, biology defying wrecks that deserve to die...&quot;  The Sue types list is pointing out the character types that most often exhibit Sue-ish qualities in the Pokemon continuum, not saying that every character of those types is a Mary Sue.<br><br>I would further state that not all Mary Sues are bad.  A &#39;Sue may be well written, well thought out and used in a manner that is enjoyable to read.   However, the overwhelming majority of them are poorly written, totally flat and used in a manner that most of us find to be truly annoying.<br><br>To sum it up, I agree with you, just because something is usually bad doesn&#39;t mean that it can&#39;t be done well.  But just because something can be done well does not mean we should ignore the fact that it is done poorly 90 percent of the time.</p>

            <p>Historical Sues are &quot;grandfathered in&quot; because we used to have different values about what we considered &quot;good writing&quot;--values that didn&#39;t at first have &quot;realistic characters&quot; at the top of the list. It wasn&#39;t until around the 1800s that people started complaining about the Sue-ness of various characters; and not until the 1950s or thereabouts that the Mary Sue problem was really addressed directly. In fan fiction, it wasn&#39;t identified or named until a couple of decades after that. So we&#39;ve been learning, collectively, to create literature with realistic characters; and what was acceptable back then isn&#39;t something we like now. It&#39;s a cultural thing, for the most part.<br><br>I&#39;ll agree that many canon/Historical Sues aren&#39;t damaging their own canons; and that, if you don&#39;t judge historical literature by modern standards, it&#39;s very enjoyable for its own sake and gives an interesting picture of what life back then was like, and what literature was like, and what values people held.<br><br>You can&#39;t judge modern literature by historical standards, either--there&#39;s a great deal more informality. Even fifty years ago, using contractions or italics for emphasis in a printed book was considered pretty informal and on the edge of acceptable (though there have apparently always been exceptions for people who used those things for artistic effect, in dialogue, or while writing in a dialect as Mark Twain often did).<br><br>Historical Sues fit into their books because back then books were written in a way that was more accommodating to Mary Sues, and sold to a readership that was more accepting of Mary Sues. But try to write the same kind of character in a modern novel, and you&#39;ll just get an Eragon or a Bella Swann. Modern canons are much less accepting of Sues in general because we expect realism, and Sues just aren&#39;t realistic. That&#39;s probably another reason why Sues in sci-fi and fantasy continua (like Drizzt and Superman, both of which I offered as examples of Canon Stus) are less grating than those who are supposed to live in a modern world. But you can go too far even then (especially when you steal half the Star Wars canon, digest it, and upchuck it onto your word processor).</p>

            <p>As I said before, many of them were (and still are) well written and well liked.  And giving them a pass does not make them not Sues.<br><br>Also, a different standard of writing back then does not mean bad.

            <p>Same as that whole &quot;essay thing&quot; a few months back.<br><br>Some of us are using &quot;Mary Sue&quot; to mean exclusively a fanfic character that is shallow, poorly written and distorts canon. By that definition, there is no such thing as a Canon Sue or a Historical Sue. It might be poor characterisation, but it&#39;s not a Sue.<br><br>Another way of looking at it is that &quot;Sue&quot; is a descriptor for an archetype of character - some of which occur in canon works, but the vast majority of which are in fanfic.<br><br>I like the definition that someone linked to around the time of that essay thing: the &quot;Stranger in the Living Room&quot;. In fanfic, the Sue is just that: someone disrupting a place that&#39;s not theirs by right, bending it to their will, as opposed to a canon-compliant OC, who would be a &quot;Guest&quot;.<br><br>For canonical characters, it&#39;s their own &quot;living room&quot; and therefore they can&#39;t be a stranger in it. Many &quot;Historical Sues&quot; work within their own <s>living room</s> canon, but would be jarringly out-of-place if put into another canon. (Beth from <i>Little Women</i>, I&#39;m looking at you - but she works within her own canon even if she isn&#39;t a very realistic character).<br><br>Elcalion, who, extending the analogy, would love to trash Eragon&#39;s living room, but won&#39;t cause he&#39;s canonical, dammit.<br><br></p>

            <p>The definition of a Mary Sue is not set, so whether a canon character can be a sue depends on how you personally interpret them. <br><br>Either definition fits (fan fic only versus character archetype) - and since the PPC only targets Fanfic OC&#39;s, whether canon and historical sues exist comes down to semantics. <br><br>If you prefer, we can rename Canon Sues and Historical sues as &#39;Canon characters that exhibit traits that commonly occur with Mary Sue characters&#39; but that seems unnecessary. </p>

            <p>I agree, that would be unnecessary, as I see nothing wrong with the terms as they are.  However, as long as we continue to use the terms Canon and Historical Sues, I don&#39;t believe that we can say that all Sues are Bad.<br><br>According to the wiki and, by extension, the organization at large, Canon and Historical Sues <i>are</i> Sues.

            <p>Just because &quot;Sues are bad&quot; doesn&#39;t mean automatically &quot;All Sues must be killed&quot;. Sometimes they&#39;re fairly benign, staying in their own canons and affecting only their home worlds, and don&#39;t need to be dealt with. Would their worlds be better if they weren&#39;t Sues? Yes. But killing them would be a bad thing because they&#39;ve inserted themselves into the canon to the degree that they&#39;re partly supporting it.

            <p>Mostly because the writing itself doesn&#39;t change, only the fact that one of them is &#39;official&#39; and one isn&#39;t.

            <p>I would agree with that. The primary thing I think of when I use the term Mary Sue is canon warping. That goes for a fully manifested Sue or the Sue-Wraith that warps the canon characters without being visible.<br><br>The poor quality of plot, spelling, grammar, etc. <i>does</i> tend to go along with that, but not always, and I dislike extreme canon warping in all its forms (badly written or well written). Which is almost contradictory, because I will read and enjoy good AU&#39;s, of course good ones make a change and then keep characters in character while dealing with the circumstances of the change, so I guess that even applies to AU&#39;s. <br><br>The Sue/Sue-wraith can only be a character that warps canon, all other traits are just common symptoms, is just my view. It does preclude the existence of Sues in canon except in rare cases of late cast additions to long running series, because they can&#39;t warp canon if they are canon. There are <i>a lot</i> of different definitions.</p>

            <p>However, I think that there is also one more basic trait to qualify for Suedom: The desire of an author to gratify himself at the expense of his work or another&#39;s. If one writes a story just so he or she can hook up with a hot person just because he/she is hot, get the love interest out of the way by killing or convering his or her love interest, or administer the Worf Effect to the strongest characters in the setting using powers pulled out from his ass, then that character is a Sue.<br><br>That said, I like Superman, and while I&#39;ve only read two of the Drizzt books (Exile and Siege of Darkness, neither of which I bought), I don&#39;t really think badly of Drizzt either (though some of the things he writes in his journal are Narm).  <br></p>

            <p>See St. Dymphna&#39;s Academy, where many of the Mary Sue characters are actually not quite Mary Sues--because they don&#39;t force the plot to revolve around them, and can&#39;t, because there are other people behind the other characters! Despite having Suvian traits like immortality, magical ability, or extreme genius, many of them have become realistic characters. It&#39;s really a fascinating experiment in Suvian psychology.</p>

            <p>Hi, I&#39;m raffitz (not really, but that&#39;s the name I go by in the Internet).<br>The way I ended up here is rather interesting: I was googling &quot;Daleks&quot; and ended up on the PPC wiki article about them. Instead of clicking &quot;back&quot; and never setting foot there again, I checked what it was. This all happened yesterday, but I&#39;ve already read through the Original Series (except for the missing chapters, and the last one as well. Acacia was my favourite agent and I wouldn&#39;t be able to tolerate the two Heavy-Metal-Maniacs even for a single episode). I decided to join the Board.<br>I suppose this is as good a place as any to put my introduction, as I didn&#39;t find any sort of categories (I&#39;m not used to this sort of posting board).</p>

The <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Permission">Permission article</a> on the wiki, in case you&#39;re interested in writing your own PPC spin-off.<br><br>4. There is no number four.<br><br>5. The <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Guide_to_the_PPC">Guide to the PPC</a>, the <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/FAQ:_For_Newbies">FAQ: For Newbies</a>, and the <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Mission_Writing_Guide">Mission Writing Guide</a>, for many of the same reasons as listed above.<br><br>And that should about do for a start.

Then:  <a href="http://www.misssandman.com/PPC/story.html"> The Orignal Series </a>(which you&#39;ve already read, but eh..).  These are the stories of the original PPC agents, who were here from the beginning.  <a href="http://rc45.dreamwidth.org/">Here </a> are the missions of Trojie and Pads--they have one of the longest mission lists in the PPC, besides <a href="http://members.home.nl/indemaat/"> IndeMaat </a> who recently hit 50.  And finally, my favorite:  <a href="http://www.misssandman.com/LOTR/ofum.html">The OFUM, and others </a>.  They&#39;re some wonderful stories by people who are pissed off at other writers who&#39;ve been dicking around without all the cards in different fandoms.  Some of them are funny, some of them are memorable, and some... well...

            <p>This is the reason there were four years between the time I joined and the time I wrote my first actual PPC story. {= p<br><br>I know what you mean about Discworld, too--I tend to mimic the style of things I&#39;ve just read. Hence, there are times I can spot definite Pratchettian moments in my writing, and other spots are more Tolkien-esque. It&#39;s a little weird.<br><br>However, there are a few things I&#39;ve noticed over the years, and maybe they&#39;ll help. The main thing is to get as specific as you can when describing things. Don&#39;t say &quot;it was totally bizarre&quot; when you can say &quot;it was like a duck trying to tap-dance while bouncing on a trampoline.&quot; ... I have no idea what that description might apply to, but I&#39;m pretty sure somebody somewhere will giggle when they read it, because it&#39;s ridiculous, and ridiculous is funny.<br><br>Another thing is timing, and that&#39;s hard to control in writing. You have to direct your readers&#39; eye to see what you want when you want for maximum impact, like a comedian building up for the punchline. If you slip and reveal the punch during the setup, it&#39;s not funny anymore.<br><br>There is also exaggeration/hyperbole, either in the over-the-top sense or in vast understatement. Using these two things (with specific description) to create contrast can also work. We&#39;re pretty well wired to respond to contrast, so that&#39;s really a separate tip unto itself. That&#39;s why having &quot;odd couple&quot; agents works so well.<br><br>And that&#39;s all I can think of at the moment. For a study in the art of awesomely amusing PPCs, I recommend the works of Tungsten_Monk, now available <a href="http://plotprotectors.tripod.com/sudiolond/">here</a> on the PPC Lost Tales archive.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>It&#39;s true for me too. I usually write in a similar style to what I&#39;ve just read. This is why it&#39;s important to read good books when you&#39;re an author. <br><br>If you don&#39;t have any good books, I would agree that Tungsten_Monk is an excellent substitute. I discovered the PPC through the OS, but Tungsten&#39;s stories are why I decided to write missions. </p>

            <p>I haven&#39;t seen those missions; did you track them down?<br><br>Anyway, yeah, I have problems with humor, too. It&#39;s very frustrating; sometimes I seem to be inspired and capable of writing some laugh-worthy stuff; and other times it&#39;ll be trite or boring. And I can never predict when I&#39;m going to be suddenly able to write humor. Needless to say, this annoys me.<br><br>I also tend to have issues with writing natural dialogue; any tips on that? It may not help that I have a tendency to interrupt or monologue IRL, and I have a hard time not having my characters monologue similarly. I&#39;ve been trying to get the stiffness out for a long while and still haven&#39;t really succeeded.</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve had them sitting around waiting to be put up for a while, I&#39;m afraid. It was Tawaki who finally got it done.<br><br>As for dialogue, I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m the best person to offer tips, because the only way I can describe how I do it is that I hear it in my head. (No, I have not been diagnosed with any serious psychiatric condition, why do you ask?) But really, when I write it&#39;s like I&#39;m hearing it all and transcribing it. So, I guess the best advice is to think of someone who talks the way you want your character to talk, and imagine them saying it.<br><br>Don&#39;t forget to include facial expressions and gestures, though. Those things are just as important as the words used, and they make a nice change from he-said, she-said dialogue tags.

            <p>Reading it out loud to yourself or someone else also helps. It helps for catching typos, missing words, and repeated words. Maybe if you can&#39;t read to anyone else, you could record it and listen to the play back as you read along with it.  Anyway, I always catch a lot of errors and strange sounding phrases when I do that.</p>

            <p>My advice would have been what Miah told you about setting your skin preferences--especially since I noticed that mind had switched to something else a few days ago, and I had to go and put it back to the custom settings. I&#39;d hoped that might fix it for everybody, since that&#39;s something I can do as an admin.<br><br>However, if it&#39;s still not working, I suggest clearing your browser&#39;s cache. It may be mistakenly loading old information instead of picking up the current information (though I hasten to add the disclaimer that I&#39;m not an expert on browsers and am pretty much making things up based on the tiny bit I do know).<br><br>If that doesn&#39;t work, I have no idea. o.o<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>The browser cache does seem most likely, now that you say it, especially since I see the blue <i>before</i> I log in. But right now I&#39;m trying to keep track of what pages I&#39;ve visited on a rather complex site, so I&#39;m going to hold off with clearing the cache until I&#39;m done over there. But afterwards I&#39;ll try it, and let you know. <br><br>Thanks :)</p>

            <p>Or at least, I have a clue. The <a href="http://memory-alpha.org/en/wiki/Portal:Main">Star Trek wiki</a> has suddenly been changed to the same blue-theme, too, and it used to be black - part of it still is, which makes me think the wiki server has made some sort of change to all its users. <br><br>That, or maybe it&#39;s just me, somehow. Tech wizards, tell me - could this be a setting on my computer that I somehow tripped by accident? No other webpages I&#39;ve visited have been affected, and I know enough about computer software to know I didn&#39;t change a setting manually.</p>

            <p>This comes as no surprise to me, though. I&#39;ve noticed that it sometimes &quot;forgets&quot; to display the custom red-themed settings, and when that happens it reverts to the blue default theme. It&#39;s always switched back on its own so far.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>It could be that your preference setting have gotten set to to override the site preferences.

            <p>Look along the top when you are logged in where it says your user name. There is a button that says more. Click it and it drops down a list. The bottom item on the list is Preferences. This brings up User Profile. You&#39;ll see Username, ID #, Number of edits, etc.  Between all this, and the My Home, User Page, etc tabs there are some small tabs. The first one says User Profile, the one next to it says Skin. Click that and then at the bottom is the &quot;Let Admins override my skin choice&quot; thing that needs to be checked. The Blue is the default, so maybe that is why it is showing up whether you are logged in or not. <br><br>Then again, this may not be it at all. I am personally really good at creating interesting faults in technology, so I could see it being something off the wall.</p>

            <p>Hello everyone. Sorry to bother you all, but in one of my many writing projects I&#39;ve come up to a point where the characters involved stop by a pub in HQ; this pub is supposed to be at least fairly popular, and to have been around for quite a while, so I was wondering if anyone would be interested in having characters of theirs make cameo appearances. If anyone is interested, please tell me which you wish to be used and anything you think I will need to know, particularly with preferences and such. Thanks for your time, I hope this isn&#39;t a problem.</p>

            <p>... since it&#39;s post-Crashing Down, Ontic&#39;s back on the scene. She doesn&#39;t really have a job to do, and she&#39;s got a lot of guilt weighing on her head, so she drinks rather a lot. She&#39;s pretty quiet and keeps to herself, though, but is likely to be found in the corner of a pub nursing a glass of something. She&#39;d also be wearing her black sweatshirt with a grey bar running across the chest; subtle, she ain&#39;t.<br><br>hS<br><br>(PS: I&#39;m sort of back online, sort of not.

            <p>I&#39;m glad your internet problems are fixed, at least to an extent; I did e-mail you about this before, if I recall, so I&#39;m glad you&#39;re interested. Ontic has the potential for awkwardness due to her past, but one of the viewpoint characters is too new to recognise her and the proprietor would make sure she isn&#39;t given trouble; he&#39;s a very &quot;leave your problems at the door&quot; type. Besides, that potential makes this sort of thing interesting. :P </p>

            <p>It wouldn&#39;t be realistic to have my Agents there (Leila doesn&#39;t drink and Julius mixes his own) but if you could make the bartender Haitian or Jamaican I would be very much obliged. I&#39;m looking to do something similar, I already have a character drawn out, and it&#39;s rather unlikely that there&#39;d be two pubs in HQ, yes?</p>

            <p>Given the size of HQ, it&#39;d actually be rather surprising if there <i>was</i> only one pub. It&#39;s supposed to be a massive building, more equivalent to a small country or at the least a big city (at least in my mind, given the sheer numbers of Agents said to work there), and I&#39;m aware that in the past other eating and/or drinking establishments have been running.<br><br>(Besides, from what I&#39;ve gathered from him, I&#39;m fairly sure KGarrett already has the bartender character drawn up.)<br><br>Just my tuppence.</p>

            <p>Yeah, there&#39;d undoubtedly be more than one pub in HQ. The logic I was operating on would be that bars and pubs - at least a few - would pop up just due to necessity considering how often agents come out of fics in desperate need of a drink, alcohol or otherwise. At the very least, we know there&#39;s also the PPC Bleepka Bar. The one featured is just supposed to be a rather popular one.</p>

            <p>You can use some of my agents, if you want. Danny would be sipping a gin and tonic and reading something (Wodehouse, perhaps, or maybe Hunter Thompson) in a quiet corner.

            <p>Miah and Cali could be there. They like beer. Miah might complain if only normal big American brands are available. She would drink Sam Adams Boston Lager or any other Sam Adams, really, or Bleepbeer. She always manages to have a &quot;slept in my clothes&quot; look about her (jeans, sneakers, and no logo t-shirt, hair in ponytail), and she is going on thirty. <br><br>Cali is in his late teens, but looks younger. He has extremely wild, bright blue hair, and never takes off his bright green rimmed, mirrored sunglasses. He wears very baggy styled pants, a long sleeved close fitting shirt, and gloves with no fingers. He&#39;s a &quot;super&quot; hero from Mystery Men continuum.<br><br>As long as this is going to be set sometime pretty soon, they probably smell like smoke. They might have soot smudges or even small burns-especially Cali, and they are probably making a bit of a fuss (without noticing that they are being too loud) about how they are <i>not</i> talking about Cali <s>scaring the living daylights out of Miah</s> playing super hero to pull a damned fool boy in a kilt who burned up all the furniture in the lounge out of the fire said boy (Unger) started.  She may be refusing to let Cali have alcohol, as her mothering instinct is riled up; although it will be phrased sarcastically or even possibly with a bit of arm smacking level violence.</p>

            <p>You know, for all of its bad points, it&#39;s not the worst story I&#39;ve ever read...There was the one with Harry (who inexplicably had catboy features), Lord Voldemort, and a horribly abused plate of pasta (before you ask--<i><b>DON&#39;T</b></i>!); and then there was the other story with Harry Potter and Lucius Malfoy in a <i>consensual</i> BD/SM relationship (Malfoy top...distrubing, hey?)<br>I&#39;ve only ever heard my one friend (the one my age, Brooke) talk about the KH characters, so...the only help I can give is by point out all the bad things that this author is doing in relationship to sex.  <br><br>Found a handy little thing that&#39;s going to pop up in my next mission--it&#39;s by a guy named Minotaur, and it&#39;s a guide (written specifically for fanfic authors) about everything related to <a href="http://www.squidge.org/minotaur/index2.html"> gay sex </a>.
