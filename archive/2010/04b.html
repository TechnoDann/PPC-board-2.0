            <p>In the Sue fics I&#39;ve MSTed, I&#39;ve noticed an odd trend of Sue characters failing the Bechdel test. The Bechdel Test is a sort of litmus test for female presence in movies and TV. In order to pass, the film or show must meet the following criteria:<br><br>1) there are at least two named female characters, who<br><br>2) talk to each other about<br><br>3) something other than a man.<br><br><br>Is this something you guys have noticed too or have I just been reading the wrong Sue fics? </p>

            <p>Technically, showgirls, red sonja, hellsing and black lagoon all pass the bechdel test, and none of them are exactly outstanding examples of gender equality. On the other hand, movies like the silence of the lambs and the lord of the rings movies(go and watch them again, I don&#39;t think there&#39;s any point where two women talk to each other) fail, but you can&#39;t say that movie is sexist. Spirited away passes, but all the women are servants, apart from the old witch-like characters. And I&#39;m not even getting into games. System shock and bioshock? The characters spend most of their time talking to or about Jack/Subject delta/the Hacker. So it fails, but... SHODAN? Lansing? Tenenbaum? Lamb? All of them important female characters. Final fantasy X-2 passes, haha that&#39;s not sexist at all.<br><br>Scanning the front layer of my bookcase:<br> I don&#39;t think half of the discworld books pass, but you can&#39;t accuse terry pratchett of being a misogynistic pig. TWILIGHT, of all things, passes. My bloody Warhammer books pass, and the only women in the entire world seem to be incredibly rare or Sisters of Shallya. nearly all of the manga I own passes, and I dare you to say manga is usually gender-equal. V for vendetta fails. Batman passes. I can&#39;t even remember if Dune passes. I&#39;d dig deeper, but I might get lost.<br><br>TL;DR while the test may help determine the gender equality of media, it is by no means a perfect reflection of the sexism inherent in said media.</p>

            <p>...Are you talking about the anime? Piratical villain protagonists, Revy, Rock, Benny and Dutch? Because I don&#39;t think it&#39;s actually that sexist. Sure, copious fanservice and all, but there&#39;s nothing inherently wrong with that as long as the ladies&#39; personalities are as well-developed as their bodies, which I&#39;d argue that they are. Also, they&#39;re not at all dependent on men.</p>

            <p>Maybe it should read &quot;two women have a conversation about something other than romance/sex&quot;? If that was true, then those shock games you mentioned would probably pass. I don&#39;t know the games, but none of those guys sound like romantics.</p>

            <p>Yes, pretty much all Sues fail that test. So does pretty much all published writing. And all TV shows, and all films, and all any media outlet you care to name. It&#39;s not a distinguishing characteristic of Suefic. It&#39;s a distinguishing characteristic of anything written in the western world at some point in the last few hundred years.</p>

            <p>... often fail both the female and male versions. My characters usually end up mostly conversing between men and women (and vice versa, I... guess?).<br><br>It&#39;s also worth noting that this may have less to do with who&#39;s allowed to talk, and more to do with the main/focus character. If your viewpoint (even third-person) is following a man around, an f-f conversation has to either break that viewpoint, or be passively observed (since if your male main character gets involved, that breaks the rule).<br><br>Of course, that <i>does</i> imply that there&#39;s a dearth of main female characters (and of course, I&#39;m not saying this is the <i>only</i> factor).

            <p>The gender of the author has little to do with it. Fics are still written in a cultural and societal framework that grants little to no worth to interactions between women that don&#39;t feature romance or men. Just because an author is female doesn&#39;t mean she hasn&#39;t grown up being repeatedly told that her only worth, in a storytelling medium, is in her facilitation of relationships with men.</p>

            <p>I saw something mentioned once about maybe some kind of special addendum for long running tv series, because most of them, if they run long enough, will eventually pass the test.  The proposal for an addendum was to counteract that possibility of a show getting a pass because of a single conversation in a ten year run.<br><br>Don&#39;t know if that&#39;s relevant or not, but I agree that they shouldn&#39;t get a pass as a whole.  Does the Bechdel test come with some kind of rating system that shows by what margin the test subject passed?</p>

            <p>I have a couple of female characters in the graphic novel script I&#39;m writing. None of the major ones have had a discussion though.  One of the major ones, Tallory, has spoken to a minor female character, Naj, during a larger argument.  Here&#39;s how the conversation went:<br><br>Description:  Tallory joins the rest of the group, who are each retrieving their horses from being tied to posts.   Christof, the avorian man in thier party, is on his horse and gets into the conversation.<br><br>Christof: <br>What&#39;s all this now?<br><br>Tallory:<br>We&#39;re not killing anymore goblins.<br><br><br>Description: The Yeanese girl, Paj, buts in.  She looks put off.<br><br>Paj:<br>And you&#39;re just deciding this for us, here and now?<br><br><br>Description: Tallory is on her horse now.<br><br>Tallory: <br>It doesn&#39;t bother you at all that we&#39;re killing for money?<br><br>Paj:<br>For five bronze bits I&#39;d brain one of my sisters.  There are plenty more where she came from. <br><br><br><br>What was the point of that?  I just wanted to paste an amusing conversation from my script. </p>

            <p>Hoo boy. This story, you guys... It makes me yearn for RL brain bleach.<br><br>From what I saw from a cursory read-through, this story is very bad. It&#39;s a Saix/Demyx Mpreg story with some Axel/Roxas on the side. Everyone is horribly OOC (including a caring and sympathetic Xemnas), time is put through the wringer (ten years in two chapters!), the prose tends toward the purple end of the spectrum and there are superfluous ellipses everywhere.<br><br>The kicker for me, though, was the final chapter. There is a touching scene where Axel gets a little &quot;close&quot; with Saix and Demyx&#39;s son (who is ten years old at this point). We&#39;re talking very bad touch.<br><br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5057354/1/Broken_The_Melodious_Diviner"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5057354/1/Broken_The_Melodious_Diviner">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5057354/1/Broken_The_Melodious_Diviner</a></a></p>

            <p>One as a section of my multi-part timeskip mission, and one for my other set of agents.  Both fics are...brain-breaking, to say the least.

            <p>The vampire one isn&#39;t <i>horrible</i>--I mostly chose it for its similarities to the fic Moon came from.

            <p>I have two Left 4 Dead badfic to report:<br><br>&quot;Life Undead&quot; by honored cur. It is located at <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5783946/1/Life_Undead"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5783946/1/Life_Undead">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5783946/1/Life_Undead</a></a>. Rated T.<br>This is a very rambling piece of fic, with Infected that keep their minds and almost no punctuation. It features a slew of original characters and little coherency.<br>Sample, including the lack of a period: <i>&quot;wow Rex time has been awful you are small you have gray skin crimson eyes you wear all black but I must admit you look buffer&quot; Dave said as he blew some smoke in Rex&#39;s face</i><br><br>&quot;Watching Over Her&quot; by SpontaneousCombustion00.

Rated M.<br>This is a Zoey/Hunter fic, which features Francis decapitating a zombie with a riot gun while simultaneously pointing a pistol at a Smoker, Zoey not only failing to shoot a Hunter but also allowing it to molest her, and said Hunter being able to talk and remember its name. The Hunter also has eyes which change color.<br>Sample: <i>&quot;That was a pretty damn good kiss, considering he&#39;s an Infected. Zoey thought.&quot;</i></p>

            <p>I guess I can&#39;t really blame the author of the second one. I mean... when a Hunter jumps you, it looks a dang lot like it&#39;s trying to rape you.<br><br>Huh.

            <p>Maybe it&#39;s because Hunters are the least obviously-deformed Infected, aside from the Commons?

            <p>It&#39;s a tragic story and I sincerely hope that Clay wins his court case. The way the LGBT community is treated in the United States (and around most of the world, for that matter) is deplorable. Everyone - no exceptions - deserves fair and equal treatment under the law.<br><br>That being said, I agree with JulyFlame. We are not getting all the facts. The website on which the story is posted has a rather obvious bias. The story itself is loaded with images of pathos designed to tweak the heart-strings of the reader.<br><br>I&#39;d like to read interviews with both Clay and representatives of the county to find out their perspectives. I want to read the reasoning behind the judgements against these two men. I want to know as many of the facts as possible. To quote one of my favorite authors, &quot;Data, data, data!

            <p>...that reading this made me tear up a little. I find it hard to believe, or understand why, the county could simply take everything those two had and sell it. It&#39;s inhuman, and it&#39;s practically stealing.<br>I&#39;m tempted to exploit Godwin&#39;s Law at this point. Out of respect, I will not. But in all seriousness, as an American, I find myself completely ashamed. Heck, last Friday, my high school held a Day of Silence in protest to the way homosexuals are being treated. I didn&#39;t think much of it at the time, and I didn&#39;t participate, but reading this made me realize how poignant their message was. On a day-to-day basis, I don&#39;t really think about these kinds of issues, because my school is extremely diverse, and with that diversity comes a certain level of liberalness. One of my best friends is openly, and unapologetically homosexual. I literally can&#39;t imagine anyone looking down on him for it, because everyone finds it pretty much impossible to dislike him.<br><br>*takes off glasses, wipes eyes, and steps down from her soap box*<br><br>Anyway... now I&#39;m all depressed again.</p>

            <p>Suppose, for a moment, that there&#39;s an old dude living alone. No surviving family, no next-of-kin or other person to take power of attorney, etcetera. Now, he&#39;s suffering from Alzheimer&#39;s, and finally collapses. Fortunately, this happens in a public space - he&#39;s rushed to the hospital, where it&#39;s determined that he really isn&#39;t capable of living on his own. At this point, it&#39;s the state&#39;s responsibility to step in and take care of things - as stated before, he has nobody else to take power of attorney. As his condition is terminal and irreversible, what is the state to do with his house and possessions? The obvious solution is to sell what he won&#39;t be able to use in the assisted living facility he&#39;s placed in, and put the proceeds towards making him comfortable there.<br><br>I&#39;m not saying that what was done to Mr Henry and Mr Clay was anything even resembling human, let alone ethical, but there are situations in which the take-everything-and-sell-it move is the best response to a situation. Whoever let these two fall through the cracks and into that bucket, though, deserves to have his house yanked out from under him.</p>

            <p>Whatever your moral stance on their lifestyle, no one should be treated like they were.  Maybe the story left parts out, stories usually do, but really, I see this incident as a commentary on the legal situation of most elderly people, regardless of their lifestyle.  <br><br>It isn&#39;t only homosexual couples who are living together unmarried either.  There are heterosexual couples who did not want to re-marry due to loss of income, or attachment to a deceased spouse.  There are even instances of couples forced to have their marriages legally dissolved to be able to qualify for needed government assistance.  Then there are sibling groups who have lived together for many years, because their spouses are gone.  I knew a set of twin sisters who lived together for 30 years after their spouses died.  They were the only person the other one had due to the early deaths of their children.<br><br>Maybe if these men had been a het married couple, the county would have allowed them into the same nursing home, but I have even seen elderly married couples split up due to differing levels of care needed.  And even a married couple would have most likely faced the same forced entry into the nursing home and the loss of possessions.  <br><br>I&#39;m sure there is an exception to this that someone can point out.  I am generalizing--Nursing homes in general are truly appalling places for the residents and the caregivers.  Unless there is outside family actively involved-as in random near daily visits-the elderly patient is very unlikely to receive good care.  As far as the caregivers go, those in the lowest rungs who are actually giving the full body care that the neediest patients require, are paid minimum wage and assigned so may tasks that it is impossible to do more than just basic assembly line personal care.  Until there are rules set up to require that adequate staffing be maintained (and turnover will always be high at minimum wage, think of the work actually being done by these people), the owners will continue to exploit both ends-the patients by taking everything they ever owned and the lowest level workers by under-staffing and under-paying.<br><br>This is an awful situation, made worse by the lack of humanity shown to these men, but it should bring the focus not just to elderly gay couples, but to all the elderly who are just a fall away from loss of all their legal rights.  It is a situation that defies all ethical bounds, as far as I am concerned, and I&#39;m glad Bronwyn pointed it out. Awareness of a problem is the first step to solving a problem.</p>

            <p>Seconded that it&#39;s not the fact that they&#39;re gay creates the problem; that&#39;s just a good hook for the media.<br><br>As for care homes: the caregivers often try their best, but they&#39;ve very little to work with. My mother was working night shifts in a care home for years, and I got the distinct impression they constantly did the best they could while understaffed and underpaid. They built relationships with the residents, were gutted when they died (as they always did: this was a nursing home, not a residential home), and were constantly being told they weren&#39;t doing their jobs properly, either by management, or by families who turned up once a month for a cursory visit and were incensed that there wasn&#39;t a nurse with their relative 24/7. The attitude of upper management was the worst problem. Low wage? Fine. Hard work? Fine. Getting fired because you&#39;re dealing with your two daughters going through a court case and also incidentally developing neurological problems? Not so fine.</p>

            <p>The standard for MST&#39;s seems to be to put one or two lines of agent/character dialogue in between every line of fanfic dialogue.  <br><br>I think that this is a mistake - it only serves to make reading the thing too disjointed.  With video commentary you are given two types of input: audio and visual.  This allows you to get a gist of how the story goes <i>while</i> you hear the snarky commentary. In a completely written work you don&#39;t have this.<br><br>I&#39;d say it&#39;s better if you lump commentary/story into larger sections each. Say, a paragraph of narration or a large chunk of a conversation, then then a small exchange of character dialogue. This also is an exercise in elegance - jokes become rarer, and you are forced to go with quality over quantity. <br><br>To go along with the current discussions going on in the PPC forum, this might also reduce the instances of characters commenting on potentially hurtful statements directly to the author. </p>

            <p>But I did end up reading it, and it made me rethink how I write my own characters. Up to now, I&#39;ve been kind of paranoid about making Mary Sues by accident, stressing over whether there&#39;s too much angst, or whether having child abuse in the past is a good idea or not, or whether this explanation is good enough for that certain trait or event. But I guess, reading this, I realize that the important thing is for the character to have meaningful strengths and equally meaningful weaknesses, and for each character to react to certain situations realistically and according to said strengths and weaknesses.<br><br>Am I hitting close to the nail here?<br><br>In response to your post, Neshomeh, I&#39;ve been thinking of doing something interesting with my agents; namely, having them tackle one of my own badfics. I dunno, maybe it&#39;ll give me better perspective on how to write missions without being unintentionally and needlessly insulting.</p>

            <p>First of all, that was a great post you just made. It was gently nudging us in the right direction, I feel. I do have a slightly different opinion on concrit, though.<br><br>Is it a nice thing to do? Sure. Is it good if the PPC does it? Of course. Should it be mandatory--should we feel like we <i>have</i> to? Absolutely not.<br><br>PotCSues put it very well when she said:<br><br><i>I never review the people I report, mostly because in order to give constructive criticism, I have to feel as though the story in question has some merit and that the author will be receptive to my critique. As such, I don&#39;t want to waste my time honestly critiquing a story for someone who will not benefit from it and/or who did not put any effort into their story in the first place.</i><br><br>In other words, constructive criticism won&#39;t work if:<br><br>a) there&#39;s no solid foundation (canon knowledge and/or language knowledge) to construct something <i>on</i>. If the best we can say is, &quot;You might want to <i>read</i> the books you say you&#39;re a fan or,&quot; or &quot;Please find a third-grader to teach you why end punctuation is a good idea,&quot; then there&#39;s really no point in giving concrit. We can be betas, but we can&#39;t be Remedial Writing 101; there&#39;s only so much we can do.<br><br>b) the author doesn&#39;t actually care about the fanfic s/he is writing. More than once, I&#39;ve caught blatant admissions that the Suethors wrote a fic down while on the phone, in class, or watching TV. If that&#39;s the case, we&#39;ll have put more effort into our critique than they&#39;ll have put into writing the fic in the first place. To mock such a fic will give us entertainment; critiquing it seems like a waste of our time.<br><br>c) the author is not receptive to criticism. This is often the case in Suefic. It’s one of the many problems with creating a Mary Sue: since the Suethor identifies with the character so strongly, s/he tends to treat even slightly negative comments about said character as a terrible personal insult. <br><br>I would argue that at least one of those holds true for a majority of the badfic we come across. That being the case, I will give concrit when I believe it will actually do some good, but I won&#39;t feel as if I am obligated to do so before every sporking or every mission. <br><br>~Araeph<br><br></p>

            <p>I didn&#39;t mean to imply that I think we must always give concrit, or that any time we do it should become a project; just that we shouldn&#39;t be afraid of it in situations where we might otherwise want to--and that includes here on the Board.

            <p>I agree. I&#39;m not interested in the author backlash. One of my pet peeves is intimidating the weak.  What is important is just having fun, and I know that if I get criticised, I&#39;d feel bad too, but it&#39;s important to take it in your stride and try harder next time.

            <p>Most certainly, this is an important part of the natural cycle of things. Deviation~correction~deviation~correction. That pattern is the way our world operates, and those that do not correct deviate away from what they originally were.<br><br>Of course, after Neshomeh spells it out so clearly it seems simple, but these things find a way of slipping in. <br><br>That is why giving the PPC a constitution is the wisest thing the Founders could have possibly done.

            <p>I popped my head out of my response center when I heard the yelling. I smiled, seeing that a water fight had broken out in the halls. I had taken the liberty of preparing myself for it this time. I pulled the AK-47 out from underneath my desk, and fingered the trigger lovingly, receiving a strange look from Leila, my partner. The DoSAT guy had demanded half a gallon of Bleepka in exchange for making it shoot bursts of water, but it would all be worth it soon. I ran out of my response center and through the halls. For once, the shifting corridors obliged me and I got to the cafeteria. I ducked behind an overturned table, and began blasting every agent in sight. Soon, I had gotten into a firefight with a guy from ESAS who had gotten the same idea as me, only with Uzis. I was hiding behind an overturned table, when out of the corner of my eye, I noticed Leila charging through the cafeteria doors. She ran through the spraying water, and somersaulted behind my table. I didn&#39;t look at her, pretending to be focused on loading ammo. &quot;I don&#39;t need the help!&quot; I told her.<br>She grinned broadly at me. &quot;I didn&#39;t come to help, matey!&quot;<br>I didn&#39;t have time to cry out as the balloon hit me, because a second one came right after it. Sputtering water, I saw her charging off, giggling. I stood up, waving my gun at her. &quot;I&#39;ll get you for this, Leila! I&#39;ll get y-&quot;<br>I didn&#39;t have time to finish my sentence, as the agent I had been fighting with blasted me in the side. Sopping wet, I ran back to my response center, gunning down anyone in my way. <br>The machine gun hadn&#39;t been my original idea. The DoSAT guy had told me my original idea was rather unstable, so he had made the AK-47 to make it up to me. (I am positive that his generosity was due to my wonderful personality as opposed to the fact that I had my battleax with me at the time). In any case, he had also given me the prototype. Cackling, I grabbed the Panzerschreck. A Panzerschreck is like a bazooka, only larger and German. I also grabbed my backpack, which I had previously filled with water balloons. The halls seemed to have returned to their usual unhelpfulness, and it took me over ten minutes to reach the cafeteria. It was a madhouse, or at least more that usually so. I looked for my errant partner, and finally saw her, laughing with some of her friends from DoI as they pelted people . I ran up to them, lauching balloons. They screamed, and ran away, through one of the many corridors leading out of the cafeteria. I ran after them, smiling so widely it looked like my head was about to fall off. <br>I really should have been more suspicious. <br>A huge black mass slammed into me, lifting me off my feet. As it hit me, it burst, drenching me with water. I hit the floor, rubbed some of the water from my eyes, and came to my senses in time to see what was happening. <br>They had rigged up a Canon Catapult, and were loading it with a trash bag filled with water. I jumped to my feet, and started running towards them. I dodged the next trash bag, and jumped onto the arm of the catapault. I blasted the DoI agents again, and I could tell the screaming was genuine this time. As I was shooting, I didn&#39;t notice Leila running towards me. Before I could shoot her, she pulled the lever that fired the catapult. <br>I suddenly flew through the air, out of the hallway, and back into the cafeteria. Snarling, incoherent with rage, I grabbed my gun, sighted my partner over the barrel, and fired.<br>Pro tip: a Panzerschreck looks the same from both ends, and will fire even if you&#39;re holding it backwards. I had been holding it against my chest, and the blast knocked the wind out of me. Hazily, I saw my partner looking at me with a smug impression on her face. Her buddies were crowded around her. &quot;Give up yet?&quot; she asked.<br>I don&#39;t answer. Instead, I reach into my backpack with both hands and pull out a bunch of small balloons. &quot;I didn&#39;t want it to have to escalate to this level,&quot; I sighed. <br>They lift their much larger balloons threateningly, not seeming very worried by my pitiful weaponry. &quot;What kind of escalation do you call that?&quot; <br>Instead of answering, I toss the balloons at them, turn tail, and run. I hear screams behind me. <i> &quot;WHAT IS THIS?&quot;<br>Trying not to laught, I shout over my shoulder to the pursuing agents, &quot;The Urple Bandits triumph again!&quot;</i></p>

Apparently the de-glittering process plus chocolate had reacted in Kyle to produce both incredible energy and the incredible desire to climb.

            <p>Cali ran around another corner, this time knocking another agent into a cache of water balloons.  He took one look at the spluttering, wet agent struggling to regain her footing, and motioned Hannah to join him in running away.  He ducked through a door into a water warzone.  Tables were overturned protecting various groups of agents, urple-the nurses had told him the name of the awful color-paint splatters covered most surfaces and agents, bits of colorful balloons and shredded trash bags littered the floor, and draped across the heat and air ducts was Kyle, sniping the groups below.<br><br>The action stopped for a moment as everyone stared at Cali.  Then the moment passed and entire group targeted him.  Hannah, apparently having a better survival instinct that Cali, had immediately dove behind the nearest table, still holding Castor.  By the time Cali had managed to join them water and urple paint ran off him in rivulets to form a large urplish puddle.<br><br>Kevin was also huddled behind the table, which Cali realized was right next to the pipes that allowed Kyle to climb to the pipes above the room.<br><br>&quot;That&#39;s it!&quot; he shouted.  &quot;Cover me,&quot; he said to Hannah and Kevin.  Hannah giggled pointing to his normally wildly spiky hair that was plastered to his head and dripping urple pain, but nodded.  With a final giggle she pumped her water gun and scanned the room.  Without an obvious target the individual fights had broken out again.  Cali let his gun hang on its sling, and climbed up the piping to the duct work.<br></p>

            <p>Now, proper grammar rules dictate that, when referring to nouns, one uses &quot;a&quot; before nouns beginning with consonants (i.e. &quot;a duck&quot;) and &quot;an&quot; before nouns beginning with vowels (i.e. &quot;an agent&quot;). <br><br>However, I&#39;ve been noticing a discrepancy with the word &quot;historian&quot;.

            <p>My phonology professor went on about this endlessly. In short, what we write as &quot;h&quot; is, in practice, a voiceless version of whatever vowel follows it - try saying the words &quot;house&quot;, &quot;hair&quot;, &quot;hear&quot; and so on, and notice the way your mouth shapes itself before you start to speak; hold it, and then alternate between voicing and not-voicing (that is, vibrating vocal chords - an easier example of that is to hiss &quot;sssssssss-zzzzzzzzz-sssssssss-zzzzzzz&quot; and feel the difference in your throat).<br><br>Sorry, I ramble. I like that subject. Anyway, point is, in practice people often drop whatever half-formed sound there is that tries to be an &quot;h&quot; in the first place, and so we use &quot;an&quot;, but that&#39;s only verbal. In writing - at least until our writing system changes to reflect spoken language, again (and becomes even MORE complicated, *sigh*) - you always need to use the &quot;a&quot;. It&#39;ll look wrong on paper otherwise. <br><br><br>...I&#39;ve gone lecture-y again, haven&#39;t I? Sorry. But I hope that helps.</p>

            <p>I believe this is the &#39;proper&#39; writing rule.  I think it&#39;s kind of wormed it&#39;s way into more casual writing to actually use an &#39;an&#39; for words that sound like a vowel though.  At that point, it comes down to whether you want to follow the letter of the law or the spirit - accept reinterpretations of language or stay purist. </p>

            <p>It has to do with whether the next word has a vowel sound, not letter. So it would be &quot;a historian&quot; or &quot;an &#39;istorian.&quot; In writing, it would probably depend on whether you wrote out the accent.</p>

            <p>Good to see you again, Firebird! :)<br><br>I think your point about the accent is a good one. If some character says &quot;&#39;istorian&quot;, then &quot;an&quot; should be used. However, &quot;historian&quot; should always be paired with &quot;a&quot;, even if the author does not pronounce the &quot;h&quot;. If the story is being read out loud and the reader says &quot;&#39;istorian&quot;, though, the &quot;a&quot; should probably be changed to an &quot;an&quot;.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m pretty sure that a/an depends on the first pronounced sound of a word. Since you leave off the initial h when speaking, you should probably use &quot;an&quot; when talking to someone, but I would use &quot;a&quot; when writing. That&#39;s just my opinion, though, and might not be the correct usage.</p>

            <p>I would like to request permission to write for the PPC. I have a writing sample <a href="http://goldenrod111.livejournal.com/305.html">here</a>, showing how one of my agents joined the PPC. I would also like to request RC #421, though I can change it if that one is taken. Before I talk about my agents, I would like to ask about the proper procedire for adopting a Mini-Rayquaza, specifically one of Miah&#39;s finds, Swaula Deen. If this Mini is already taken, don&#39;t worry. If it still needs to be caught, I can wait. It does, however, have a bit of a role in future storylines.<br><br><u>Agent Randall</u><br>Randall comes from something else I&#39;m writing (the wiki&#39;s <a href="http://fairylandfiction.wikia.com">here</a>, but there&#39;s hardly any pages in it so far), having fallen through a plothole into the depths of HQ. He was rescued by and partnered with Agent Alexis in the DoMS. Before joining, Randall was called Ardolf and lived in a small mostly-medieval town, in a world where magic is common—Randall was one of very few people without any magic. He enjoyed drawing and was bitten by a werewolf after one of his pictures kept him in a neighboring forest for too long. His condition allows him to heal more quickly and be a bit stronger than most people, but it also increases his &quot;animal&quot; feelings, making his anger, fear, etc. almost uncontrollable. He is still working on redirecting these feelings so he is less violent, but, for the most part, he now accepts his inner wolf.<br><br><u>Agent Alexis Green</u><br>Alexis comes from a fictional manga-based Pokйmon badfic, and was a character replacement for Green, who only played a minor part in the story. The agents who tackled the fic did not find her kill-worthy, and instead recruited her. She was placed in the DoMS, and not much of her story is known until recently. She found Randall wandering around HQ and took him to the Marquis de Sod, believing that anyone who wore clothes in such disrepair couldn&#39;t be a Sue. She was then partnered with him, as her last partner had &quot;left&quot;. She still enjoys her home continuum, and hopes to eventually get a Mini-Rayquaza.</p>

            <p>*poke*<br><br>I don&#39;t know what you&#39;ve already read, of course, but there are a few things you should definitely make time for. First, there is the <a href="http://www.misssandman.com/PPC/story.html">Original PPC Series</a> by Jay and Acacia. It is our canon and that which started it all.<br><br>Second, we require that everyone read and abide by the <a href="http://twistedskein.webs.com/PPCHome/Constitution.htm">Board Constitution</a>, because it&#39;s nicer that way.<br><br>After that, there are several helpful documents on the Wiki designed to help acquaint newcomers with us and our habits and behaviors and general weirdness. Sedri&#39;s <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Guide_to_the_PPC">Guide to the PPC</a> is particularly informative, especially when combined with the <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/FAQ:_For_Newbies">FAQ for Newbies</a> and the <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Mission_Writing_Guide">Mission Writing Guide</a>. If you do want to write PPC missions, you should also see the article about how to get <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Permission">Official Permission</a>.<br><br>And that&#39;s probably quite enough to start with. {= ) Welcome!

            <p>or cry<br>It&#39;s a fairly well written LOTR fic, grammatically and linguistically speaking... but... It&#39;s just the willful, and quite frankly (IMHO) unjustified dismissal of most of the relevant canon. And fer cryin&#39; out loud - the authors have even read the damn series. <i>AND THEY DISMISS THEM OUT OF HAND IN THE ...ING AUTHOR&#39;S NOTE!</i><br>And then there&#39;s the Legomance in there. Just on general principle I despise Legomance (and Legolas in general, but that&#39;s just the movie version of him); oh, and apparently, Tolkien got everything about the elves wrong, don&#39;t&#39;cha know? Apparently elves can have divorces, have multiple partners (provided they&#39;re mortal of course [odd...]), and all the elvish language that Tolkien spent so long creating is also apparently wrong. *GRRrraggh!*<br>*headsplode* Can I scream now and hunt down the author duo, or am I overreacting?<br>-foaming at the mouth, HW</p>

            <p>I would have to read it to be absolutely sure, but from your description this sounds like a trollfic. Look, the grammar and spelling are good, so the author(s) obviously know how to write, they&#39;ve read the books so they know what the canon is, but they still get everything wrong about elves, mangle the canon in every way possible, and they admit that they&#39;re doing these things. All of these are classic trollfic characteristics. If you want to, link me to the story, and I can confirm my suspicions. <br><br>P.S. I don&#39;t think the Board is the type of forum to do get all suspicious about it, but before somebody says &quot;Hmm, he knows a lot about trollfics, I wonder if he...&quot; I would like to say, &quot;Ayup.&quot; That settle anything?<br><br>P.P.S.

            <p>Answer to the first: It&#39;s not a trollfic, per se... It&#39;s just got to be a rather magnificent piece of canon mangling. I mean, the first part of everything about the elves in the series being invented by a spiteful little bastard named Julien (and whoever does a mission into <i>that</i> should recruit him), trying to get back at Legolas. Really, the entire thing, the premise included, is just ridiculous.<br>For the fic: there&#39;s a link in the post called &quot;link&quot;.<br>For the second question: HTML tags. for italics  and  (remove the spaces before/after the &#39;i&#39; to get the tag), and add letters like &#39;b&#39; for bold, &#39;u&#39; for underline, etc. And there&#39;s one for links, but I don&#39;t remember it.<br>-H_W</p>

            <p>Its a case of a writer thinking they know more about the series than the author does.  People have rejected J.K. Rowling&#39;s canon of Harry Potter because they wanted Harry to end up with Hermione.  Of course this is still unacceptable, and we&#39;re here to point out how wrong people are about these things, in a comical fashion so feel free friend.</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve always thought that the summary you give to your story is rather like the description on a menu in a resturant.<br>What sounds better Fish and Chips, or Line caught Cod in Beer batter, served with thick overn cooked chips? <br><br>Personally I&#39;d prefer the sound of the second one, so why oh why do so many authors give their stories summaries like &quot;Lol, I reely suck at summeries, just read it &#39;k!&quot;<br><br>Now to me that is like advertising your story as Reclaimed blobs of white fish, glued together with starch and deep fried, with microwaved bits of reformed potato. Not making me want to read the story at all.<br><br>So what in a summary makes you click the back button on your browser? For me, quite apart from any of my personal dislikes it is the presence of the phrases &quot;I suck at summaries&quot; and &quot;plz r&amp;r, no flames&quot; both of which leave me cold.<br></p>

            <p>This is especially important to new fanfic readers.  I stumbled into some awful stuff before I figured out what was between the lines on the summaries.  Even now, I much appreciate a nice bold, in the summary, warning for things like shipping, slash, and various things that can be considered squicky.<br><br>I really like the slash warnings to be obvious, because my favorite stories are <i>friendship</i> stories between characters frequently slashed.</p>

            <p>I actually hate slash warnings. I find them to be inherently homophobic, or at least support homophobia, because of the implication that homosexuality is something that needs to be warned about. It shouldn&#39;t be. A romance story is a romance story whatever the genders of the characters involved, and I hate that people treat slash as different from het in any way.</p>

            <p>... it&#39;s probably better to clearly delineate Slash at the beginning.

            <p>It depends entirely on what is the dominant expectation for the characters involved. <br><br>Atticus, in the Ukiah Oregon books, has a canonical appreciation of women, but his long-term relationship with Ru means that if I were reading a fanfic and Atticus was paired with a woman, I would darn well want a het warning.  <br><br>In NCIS, where Gibbs has been married four times, and dated several women during the course of the show, and where Tony has dated dozens of women, including one very seriously, and neither of them has ever talked about men, I expect some indication that they are going to be involved with men, however that indication is accomplished, whether through the romance genre tag, good story summary, or an explicit slash warning. <br><br>Hey, just had a thought here.  These two men are also not dating their female co-workers in canon.  If the author has them dating one of their female co-workers, I fully expect them to let me know that up front, too.  So, I really do expect het warnings as well, they just usually come in the form of annoying mish-mashes of the names involved.  Jiva, Tiva, Jibbs!  I&#39;d a whole lot rather just see HET! and the character&#39;s names listed in the Character A, Character B slots.  Let&#39;s go on a campaign together to get people to list HET! when they put canons in male/female relationships.  Then you&#39;ll see the word Het, and I won&#39;t see the stupid name mish-mashes in place of the word het.<br><br></p>

            <p>Well, I just read fanfic, I don&#39;t write it, but I want a warning for any relationship that isn&#39;t going on in canon.  If it is one that has been in canon, but in later seasons is no more, then I still want a warning for that, unless the story is already marked as being set in that time frame.  <br><br>If it is a solid canon relationship, then if there were no warnings I would think that is what the story was going to include.  I wouldn&#39;t want a warning for a story that had Leia and Han together.  I would want a warning on a story that had Han and anyone else together or Leia and anyone else together.  That holds for canon male/male or female/female relationships.  I would not expect a warning for a Ukiah Oregon story that had Atticus and Ru, or Ukiah&#39;s moms together.

            <p>If I were there to read about characters in a canonical homosexual relationship, I would not expect a warning.  Since I am there to read about characters who are canonically very heterosexual, I expect a warning that they will be portrayed very differently than they are in canon.<br><br>I did not include slash under my examples for squick.  There are times when I enjoy reading slash, even about the characters I was talking about earlier. Some of the stories that are on my favorites list are slash of those characters.  However, in canon, they are portrayed pretty strongly as het.  I expect the slash warning to let me know that this story is going to be trying to do a good job of convincing me that canon was missing something.  If the characters were in a homosexual relationship in canon, I would expect warnings if the author put them in het relationships.</p>

            <p>That&#39;s a point, but the thing is, how many characters are actually, specifically stated to be exclusively straight? (Putting them in a heterosexual romantic relationship does not count, and if you say it does the bisexuals of the world would like a word with you. Obviously there needs to be a plausible explanation of why the love interest isn&#39;t present, though.) Also, it&#39;s not really &quot;very differently&quot; to portray them as gay (unless the author is adding in gay stereotypes, mannerisms, etc, in which case they are doing it wrong). It&#39;s just an extension to who they&#39;re attracted to. <br><br>Also, on some sections of the Pit, slash warnings can be pretty redundant anyway. &quot;Character A: Johny McMasculine. Character B: Harry von AlsoMale. Genre tag: Romance. Hmm, I think it&#39;s totally het.&quot; On LJ or something (I think, I&#39;m less familiar with it), it&#39;s of course a different story. </p>

            <p>I am mostly reading at the pit, and the warnings help me avoid these types of stories:  &quot;Characters A and B had been dating and making public displays of affection toward one another while at work in their jobs as officers in the US military.(even though, Character B doesn&#39;t even make public displays of affection in his het canonical relationships) And now our story begins.&quot;   Or this type of story:  &quot;Yes we are 15,000 words into this story, and no, I haven&#39;t so much as mentioned that Characters A and B are in a relationship, but this entire chapter is a lemon that has nothing to do with, and was not foreshadowed by, the plot.&quot;  (Actually, I would expect a warning for either slash or het in that case.)  Or this one, and the one that I really like the warnings to be there to help me avoid, &quot;Character A is a strong, mature, masculine guy.  Because Characters A and B are dating, I am going to completely emasculate him and turn him into a simpering, needy shell of himself.&quot;  <br><br>Really, now that I think about it more, I use the SLASH.  DON&#39;T LIKE--DON&#39;T READ type warnings as part of the code that tells me this is most likely going to fall into one of those story types above that I want to avoid, and not some well thought out, well written, treatise on what canon failed to show us.  I take them as a convenient Pit shorthand that indicates that the likelihood of this story being badly written is even higher than normal for the pit.  Stories that are well written tend to have a summary that is well written and makes their relationship choices obvious, so they don&#39;t require a SLASH warning for people who don&#39;t want to read slash to be able to avoid the story.<br><br>As long as it continues to serve that function as pit shorthand for me, I am going to continue to appreciate its presence.</p>

            <p>There&#39;s no real definition for an FF.net muse.

            <p>In short, the Greek Muses were minor goddesses/spirits who inspired art and music and poetry. The term has come to be used by writers as meaning the source of their creative ability; if your Muse is feeling lazy, nothing gets done. Some people play on it and add that tf she&#39;s indulged with extra viewings of her(/your) favourite show or book, she can be bribed into giving more inspiration. Chocolate also works. Some people say they have multiple Muses - sometimes one for each fandom, or one for writing and one for painting, or whatever.<br><br>Long version of the original Greek stories are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muse">here</a>.<br><br>Hope that helps. :)<br></p>

            <p>Something I saw recently reminded me; I&#39;ve always mentally differentiated between AU and AC, or Alternate Continuity. In my mind, Alternate Universe fic is set somewhere completely different and all that&#39;s in common with canon is the characters, while alternate continuity stories run identically to canon until point X, when they start being different. ACs tend to get created retroactively when sequels come out.<br><br>Anyway, I thought I picked this up somewhere, but I can&#39;t thing where, so I was wondering whether anyone else had ever heard of the terms being used like that. Thoughts?</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve always heard &#39;alternate universe.&#39;<br><br>I think the comic book industry played some role in the establishment of &#39;alternate universe&#39; as the dominant phrase. While the idea of a parallel reality is found in multiple genres, DC and Marvel arguably got the most mileage out of it. Both companies have their own multiverses. Marvel has their What If line and DC has their Elseworld&#39;s line.<br><br>The comic definition of AU covers both of the distinctions you mentioned. An example of the first type (different setting, same characters) would be DC&#39;s Crime Syndicate of America. An example of the second (running identically until point X) would be DC&#39;s The Nail.</p>

            <p>I think most people (at least in my fanfic circles) do. But, there is definitely a difference and if we could go back and change the way fanfic terminology grew, I&#39;d rather like to use your two types instead. Sadly, it&#39;s too late now; no one would understand. </p>

            <p>I&#39;ve never heard the term &quot;Alternate Continuity&quot; before. Strangely, now that I have heard it, I&#39;d completely switch the distinctions that you have there. Yes, I know that a &quot;Universe&quot; is bigger than a &quot;Continuity&quot;, but it seems to me like an AC story would be how you have described AU.</p>

            <p>but I personally use AU for both types of story. The distinction you draw between the two types is a useful one, but not one that I&#39;ve seen used so far.<br><br>E.g. most people I&#39;ve seen would describe a Boromir!Lives or the Fellowship actually getting over Caradhras as an AU, even though they fit your &quot;AC&quot; definition of following canon up to a given point and then diverging.</p>

            <p>It sounds like something somebody used in one story for some plot reason and which never came up again. Weird. <br><br>But I know (despite not wanting to know - stupid steel-trap memory...) that &quot;THX-1138&quot; is a series of numbers George Lucas always tries to slip into his movies, so I imagine that if other continua had similar strings of relevant numbers (or letters), they&#39;d be included. <br><br>Actually, wait - the last letters are the author&#39;s initials. Look:<br>Harry Potter: GNZ-4138-209-JR - J. (K.) Rowling<br>Star Wars: THX-1138-525-GL - George Lucas<br>Batman: FJЖ-4432-120-BK - No idea, but I&#39;ll bet &quot;BK&quot; is some original creator&#39;s name. <br><br>As for the numbers... I only know Harry Potter well enough to guess, but it looks like they&#39;re fairly random. The only thing you might do is match up the numbers to the letters on a telephone dial and see if they make any relevant words (JKR did that in book five herself, I believe).<br><br></p>

            <p>There are no corresponding letters for the number 1 on a telephone dial (or at least, not on my telephone).

            <p>Reading through the author note now.  Inner ear is ringing considerably, and that&#39;s only from *reading* the frakkin&#39; thing.  Have come across this gem:<br><br>&quot;I was NEVER angry with the reviewers not liking the story, it’s how they handled themselves when leaving me the reviews.  Getting riled up, ranting and raving, screaming and spitting nails over this story is what has caused me to get upset, not the fact that they didn’t like it.&quot;<br><br>This is coming from somebody who just posted a twenty-line rant against negative reviewers, COMPLETELY IN ALL CAPS?

            <p>I have been part of a group of people that have been doing an IRC MST of this fic. It&#39;s extremely disturbing. It starts with ten pages of &quot;DO NOT READ THIS IF YOU ARE OFFENDED BY ANYTHING&quot; and &quot;I DON&#39;T LIKE PEOPLE SAYING BAD THINGS ABOUT MY FIC&quot; and then a preface and a preface to a preface. I love it because it communicates what a history the fic must already have, with people vehemently criticizing it already. <br><br>I mentioned in the essay discussion about some Mary Sues being conformist to traditional gender roles and from what I&#39;ve seen, &#39;Jenna&#39; fits this to a T. Her existence is at first empowered, as a travelling salesman (at the age of 14?!), but then her true happy life only begins once she finds a man she can marry and do lots of naughty business with.<br><br>PS. the wedding scene is hilarious. It reminds me of the weddings some fans have in real life. IRL it&#39;s just cute and a bit dorky, but in this fic and this context, it&#39;s disturbing. I forget but was the CAKE shaped like the frakking Tri-Force?<br><br>PPS. If you wanted to do an analysis of the sexual symbology (besides the obvious, painful sex scenes), you&#39;d have a field day with the horses and the mounting and the everything. Well, they ARE dreams...</p>

            <p>So we get to our first actual instance of combat (le gasp) as traditional mary sue rapist dark link does.. well, absoluitely nothing. They attack him, apparently all he really wants to be is under the sea in an octopus&#39; garden in the shade.<br><br>Haha, the healer gives Jenna-sue a drug which gets rid of morning sickness. We had that too, in the &#39;60s!. IT WAS CALLED THALIDOMIDE.<br><br>But wait! Jenna develops a new plot device to save her from dark link! Now she can control the elements. Derp dee derp dee derpity doo. Upon returning to the castle zelda is all like OMG U AR SILVERLITE and apparently silverlites are the ancients of the world. DERP D... forget it.<br><br>Throughout the entire thing the only curse they use is &quot;by the goddess!&quot; then all of a sudden jenna says HOLY SHIT! The sex scenes are quite hilarious. They scream each other&#39;s names, REALLY LOUD if the several exclamation marks are anything to go by, and they scream over and over again like they&#39;re in the end of paranormal activity.<br><br>So another completely uninteresting plot occurs or something and they go back home, where they are attacked by a deepcrow(that&#39;s just how I see it in my head). its &quot;soul propose&quot; is to steal link&#39;s children! We can only assume that this is an agent that went MIA and is out of contact attempting to repair the fandom against the will of the god-mode sue.<br><br>And then it ends. and then there is almost 30 things the author has to explain, not a good sign when writing a fanfic. For the world to be repaired, several regions of land would have to be destroyes, species made extinct, flowers burned until not a trace remained. And it is not necessary to call a pegasus with a horn a &quot;unipeg&quot;. Not that I think they even exist in canon.<br><br>Well, I need to return to my normal state of mind.

            <p>... about teens and college-age kids becoming literally suicidal because they can&#39;t go to Pandora (the planet from the Avatar movie). I am firmly in favour of encouraging them. If someone&#39;s life is so pathetic that they want to die because they can&#39;t go to a fictional place, AND they&#39;re so stupid that they watched that movie and failed to notice that pretty much everything on that planet is trying to kill everyone that lives there, they have no business living.</p>

            <p>Now, I&#39;ve only just joined the board, but I&#39;ve read quite a few badfics, so I suppose I can offer some rudimentary advice :P and I have to agree it&#39;s very difficult to decide. I started with the pokemon one, since I know quite a bit about that. While there&#39;s not too much character development available in the two chapters to make her seem perfect, the story starts by talking about her HAIR (oh god, my immortal flashbacks) and lines like &quot;When you were a baby, a gypsy was passing through Blackthorn and walked by your father holding you.&quot; Eevee told her through thought. &quot;She stopped and told him, &#39;Your daughter will be blessed with a great gift, a gift no one will understand, and she will be able to calm even the most menacing beast.&quot; are VERY sue-like. She&#39;s also written 3 stories about Twilight, which is suvian from beginning to end.<br><br>I think that if she is a sue, it&#39;s very borderline. The twilight stories are, of course, suefics, but then again Twilight is a series which encourages sue writing and everyone and their mother has written a suefic on ff.net about twilight. I can&#39;t offer any opinion on her code geass fanfic because I&#39;ve never watched it and frankly don&#39;t like the sound of it because I&#39;m british.</p>

            <p>now, this is actually pretty good. Proper vampire stories, in my opinion, should always treat vampires as monsters or, if they&#39;re done well, dizzt do&#39;urden type chaotic good characters. Except there are hundred of drizzt knockoffs now. This story represents the way a person would end up if they had from childhood a desire to kill people. Also, I like the way in which she killed that peice of shit character in a cavalcade of terrible characters. Stabbing scissors through his throat, hell yes I&#39;d love to do that, I&#39;d watch him suffocate to death and when he started to heal I&#39;d do it again, and again, and again, dear god I don&#39;t think I&#39;d ever get tired I could gut every character in twilight over and over, rip them to pieces and burn them in the good old fashioned way I would ruin them all and oh let&#39;s not forget bella that vapid waste of air Bella jesus I would give her special treatment there would be no end to the pain I would inflict on her Seriously if I spent one day in the twilight universe I would find a nuke and launch it on all of forks I would end everything EVERYTHING MAYBE EVEN ALL LIFE ON THE PLANET BECAUSE THEY SHARE THE SAME AIR AS THOSE RIDICULOUS FAILURES OF CHARACTER DESIGN DO YOU HEAR ME WORLD YOU ARE NOT SAFE YOU ARE NOT SAFE FROM MEEEEEEE<br><br>But I digress. If I had to complain about one thing, it&#39;s that the character annoys me in the same way that starcraft&#39;s kerrigan annoys me, the whole &quot;OH HAY GUYS BTW IM EVIL NOW&quot; face heel turn. Otherwise it was okay.<br><br>I&#39;m amazed. You have presented something that may actually redeem the twilight fandom in some small way. Kudos to you. Not to the twilight fandom, of course. They are crazy and I still don&#39;t like THEM.</p>

            <p>The vast majority of <i>Twilight</i> goodfics I&#39;ve seen, though, are the ones that focus on characters other than the leads - usually the vampire family. I read the books a while ago just to keep everyone from nagging me about whether I loved or hated them, and the honest answer is that I wouldn&#39;t read any of them again, but I will read the good fanfic. Odd. <br><br>Anyway, I can link you to some good ones too, if you like.</p>

            <p>I really loved &quot;Eighteen&quot; and have to agree with most of the points about Twilight goodfics -- they are usually about character development, and not focused on that ultra-shimmery main couple.  &quot;Eighteen&quot; actually gave me the jitters a bit.  I&#39;m moving on to &quot;The Paper Doll Kindergarten&quot; next.  <br><br>I read Twilight because my friends told me to read it so I could bash it better, and honestly I&#39;d never read it again (though I did skim Breaking Dawn several times as a twisted black-comedy *think of the MST possibilities* guilty pleasure), and I actually dismissed the whole Twilight fanbase as inane.  This is the first time I&#39;ve noticed, actually, that though the main Twilight plot is actually super-saccharine, the characters and setting make for millions of dark little subplots that could lead to good writing.<br><br>*wants to know all those subplots*<br><br>The whole Renesmee/Jacob idea has been entirely changed for me now.</p>

            <p>I seem to have a different taste than you do. Anyway, here are the Twilight fanfics I read that I found worthwhile - either because they made the existing (not-so-good) canon better or just because they appealed to my sense of humour:<br><br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3919836/1/">Rosalie&#39;s Revenge</a> - Probably <i>the</i> best story I&#39;ve seen, very long and very well-written, set almost entirely in the 1930s. I love it - much, much, much more than any of the canon novels.<br><br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4080750/1/">The Souvenir</a> - Short but good, for a &quot;meet a historical figure&quot; challenge.<br><br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4404460/1/">Climate Change</a> and its sequal, <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4387633/1/">A Climate I Enjoy</a> are fairly good pieces focusing on the characters of Jasper and Alice - if you&#39;re something of a romantic (like me, I admit), it&#39;s quite good.<br><br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3866852/1/">Losing Your Way</a> - A Halloween ghost story that&#39;s nicely done (not a thriller or action, I&#39;m afraid, but still good).<br><br><br>Now the funny ones:<br><br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4169295/1/">Brotherhood</a> - This is, without a doubt, the <i>funniest</i> story I&#39;ve ever read, perhaps in any fandom. It&#39;s great but, to get the full impact of the humour, you need to know the films <i>The Princess Bride</i>, <i>Monty Python and the Holy Grail</i>, and the works of Shakespeare fairly well (though Shakespeare less so, because the humour involving his work doesn&#39;t need context to be understood). If you know them, you&#39;ll cry laughing, really.<br><br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3539340/1/">Notes</a> - Much less intelligent than <i>Brotherhood</i>, and not exceedingly well-written (and also rather out-of-character, though in the case of this fandom I suspect you don&#39;t much care), but pretty funny nonetheless.<br><br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4242549/1/">That Darn Emmett</a> - Also funny, but also not in overly sophisticated way.<br><br><br>Most things by the author <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/u/1318747/">Eowyn77</a> are good. I particularly like a series of three stories in which she fleshed out the very background characters of the Denali vampires, starting with <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3648326/1/">Fair Game</a> (the follow-up stories are more written for humour than character expansion, but I still laughed.)<br><br>She&#39;s also written <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4080920/1/">Pilgrim</a>, which was for that same &quot;meet a historical figure&quot; challenge, and <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4673529/1/">Priority Client</a>, which I highly recommend, as it&#39;s a clever (and slightly nerve-wracking) point-of-view piece from the perspective of the Mr Jenks who forges false passports for the family. <br><br><br>There&#39;s also the author <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/u/1153791/">whitereflections12</a>, who writes fairly good family fluff pieces. <br><br><br><br>And... now I look like a <i>Twilight</i> fan. Hmph. Oh, well. </p>

            <p>Hey, just another noob here. I&#39;ve been reading bad fanfic for a long time now, ever since I read my immortal. Found the ppc while looking for &quot;legolas by laura&quot; to read again, and after reading the original series thought it sounded like a great way to finally do something involving them. So consider me signed up! I&#39;ve never written anything in a creational capacity before(that I distributed to the world at large) but I&#39;d really like to get started.<br><br>And I&#39;ve read Celebrian, so I&#39;ve been to Naraka and back. And I&#39;m kind of interested to see if anyone could find anything more disturbing since I found out it was a trollfic. Pease, if you could oblige that would be brilliant.</p>

All I can offer in the way is a truly awful badfic I stumbled across while looking at a prospective target (on the adult Pit, so I should have known better *reaches for Bleeprin*) - a series of delightful fics centred round a pairing of Shagrat/Faramir. *is squicked*<br><br>Have a platter of chocolate-covered profiteroles, a recruiting poster of Lord Kitchener, and a pet mongoose, available for collection from the PPC Mongoose Shelter.</p>

            <p>Always nice to have new boarders ;)<br><br>Anyway, you are either much braver than I am, or your brain has a lack of mental nerves.

            <p>How did you guys know I was in to Warhammer and Early 20th century Military gear? (seriously - I&#39;m still trying to find out if it&#39;s legal to own a WW1 trench spike in the UK, and where I can find one if so). Well, I&#39;ll take the helmet, it&#39;s better than what we get in the Guard. And the antibacterial sword will come in handy when I need to amputate my limbs in order to escape my inevitable capture at the hands of chaos. The granite pillow is far more comfortable than the standard issue one  so thanks for that. The emperor scorpion I can throw at the commisar when I invariably fail my leadership test facing down a horde of charging berserkers, and the bumper sticker I can use to cover up the plasma flash burns I have after Larry&#39;s gun exploded in a blast of searing light. So thanks to everyone! :P<br><br>Poor Larry. I always thought there was something wrong with him.<br><br>And now, some controversy! I&#39;ve read the rules and I know for a fact that I&#39;m good with most of them. I&#39;ve never had a problem with other people&#39;s opinions, and I respect people&#39;s free will, but about rule 18... well, I don&#39;t HATE lord of the rings, in fact I think it is quite good fiction and it pretty much invented high fantasy, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s the masterpiece everyone makes it out to be, and it starts really slowly. I actually skipped past the shire portion of the start of the book because it was going on about things like baggins family history and I don&#39;t know if this was just my version, but it had a 30 page foreword on such topics as the consistency and usage of Hobbit pot. Otherwise it was very good and I would recommend it if I knew anyone who had more mental stamina than a gnat with ADD. So there. Am I getting banned now? :P</p>

            <p>I skipped bits my first few times through <i>Lord of the Rings</i>, too. That might have something to do with the fact that I was in 5th, 6th, 7th grade at the time, but still. I at least won&#39;t hold that against you.<br><br>However, I will defend to the death every word Tolkien used, and tell you why. {= )<br><br>Regarding the foreword, just for one, Tolkien was writing before anyone had ever heard of Hobbits/Halflings/whatever (&#39;cause, you know, he invented them). He and his editors probably felt it necessary to offer those words of explanation of their history and culture outside the actual text of the story, but in a place where it would be visible to the readers, who otherwise might have found themselves completely lost. The pipeweed (which is actually akin to tobacco, not pot) actually plays a fairly important role later in the story, it being Saruman&#39;s way of buying his way into the Shire and taking over, so knowing its role in Hobbit life does matter. Nowadays, of course, everyone has heard of Hobbits even if they haven&#39;t read the books, so the foreword may seem a bit superfluous to the modern eye. But it IS there for a reason.<br><br>That said, if you fancy something a little more condensed that stays true to canon, I highly recommend Brian Sibley&#39;s radio adaptation. Yes, it&#39;s going to sound a little corny when they put narration in the mouths of characters so the audience knows what&#39;s going on, but at least it&#39;s CANON. And the voice-acting is top notch. You&#39;ll recognize Frodo, at least. The same actor played Bilbo in the movies. {= )<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>We all know Medical is phenomenal at the PPC, capable of reviving canons killed in fics and, while short of outright resurrection, healing up Agents spectacularly. Though with all its technology, is it capable of reversing things from various canons that are stated to be impossible to reverse?<br><br>Here&#39;s an example scenario: Agent Whatsisface (DMS, Bleach Division) is pursuing Mia Esplendissima, pink-haired Negative-First Espada and TWU WUV of Ulquiorra Cifer, through the halls of Las Noches when he bumps into Hueco Mundo&#39;s lord, master, and wearer of very stylish coats, Sosuke Aizen, and is hypnotized.<br><br>Now, it is stated many times in Bleach canon that Aizen&#39;s hypnosis is irreversible; once he gets you, he controls everything you see from then on. Obviously this would be a risk to the PPC, but could Medical correct it? More importantly, should they? Would reversing something irreversible cause weird things to happen?</p>

            <p>I had a thought on this.  It may be that in the universe of Bleach, Aizen&#39;s hypnosis is irreversible.  However, it occurs to me that hypnosis involves the brain.  That said, perhaps the use of a neuralyzer might reverse said hypnosis.<br><br>To sum up: Using canon methods = irreversible.  Using out of canon methods = possibly reversible.<br><br>It might take some time to figure out the treatment, but there may be a cure using techniques and technologies from other universes.</p>

The thing is, there&#39;s an agent Tristan on the RC list, but I can&#39;t find him anywhere else.They&#39;d both be in Floaters. <br><br>Second, and this is just a minor plot point, would singing &#39;Love Story&#39; by Taylor Swift in HQ get me shot at?

            <p>Simply put? You can call your agents whatever you like, and sing whatever you like :)<br><br>There have been plenty of agents with similar or the same names, particularly when those names are standard normal names, like Tristan, or Bob or Amy or whatever. <br><br>Likewise, it&#39;s your agent character. If they like Hilary Duff and Nickelback, then they like Hilary Duff and Nickelback. Not everyone is going to agree, but that doesn&#39;t mean that we forbid them. </p>

            <p>Is it a PPC charge for simply writing a songfic?

            <p>It mostly irks me with the battletech novels, which have an alarming tendency to jump into the middle of battles, without always giving a clear idea of which regiments are participating or why the battle is important for several pages.

            <p>I guess that makes sense. The format can be dispensed with when you&#39;re not doing something with some kind of global reach, though, I think; I mean, if every setting is &quot;Some room in this house/school/castle&quot; it&#39;s not necessary.

            <p>Theoretically there could be such a thing as a good songfic, but I think the consensus is that most of them are bad and that making a good one is probably so difficult as to be nearly impossible.<br><br>I think the issue comes from trying to include an auditory effect in a purely visual medium. If you listened to the song in question while reading the story it might work well, but simply injecting the lyrics into the narrative makes only for disjointed writing, especially when the lyrics don&#39;t quite fit the action. If a writer managed to pull it off smoothly, though, and had an interesting story to tell rather than an angstfest, it could work.<br><br>So, to answer the question, no, simply writing a songfic is not a charge. As with any other type of fic, the charge list for a songfic would have to demonstrate <i>why</i> it&#39;s a bad songfic.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>The idea I have is setting up a department that deals with bad songfics specifically, with a couple of certifiable CloudCuckooLanders as the department&#39;s pioneer Agents.<br><br>Question 1.  Would this department qualify as a sub-department of the Department of Floaters, since the two agents would be dealing with fics from multiple different universes?<br><br>Question 2.  If I were to write this, I fear I will be a hypocrite.  I myself have written a songfic on FFN, seen here in the Redwall section:<br><br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5227553/1/Next_Door"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5227553/1/Next_Door">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5227553/1/Next_Door</a></a><br><br>The songfic in question was primarily made as a gift for another writer, with whom I am writing an AU Mariel/Dandin fic.  I knew it was plotless, and that, walking in, nobody would really know what it was about unless they read the fic my partner and I were working on, so I tried to direct them to read the other fic first.  That fic can be found here:<br><br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4744772/1/Return"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4744772/1/Return">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4744772/1/Return</a></a><br><br>Both works involve Nona, who is a blatant self-insert of mine, though not a ridiculously overpowered one who makes everyone worship her.  My partner had liked her, because she was a much different personality than Mariel, and yet she had a crush on Mariel&#39;s boyfriend-ish figure.  He asked for my help in writing a piece about a love triangle between the three; I agreed, and have since been fervently trying to fight off accusations of her being a Sue.<br><br>The songfic, heh, I admit it, is not my best work.  It involves two otherwise perfectly sane characters acting like a couple of lovesick teenagers, and the writing is a bit disjointed.  I tried to lampshade it a bit with some smart-alecky comments from some older, wiser females, but the fact remains that it is indeed rather corny.  However, it&#39;s not as bad as most songfics out there...though I do say so myself.<br><br>Would I be a horrible hypocrite to PPC bad songfics when I have this on my record?</p>

<li>All the major departments deal with a specific type of badfic: Department of Mary-Sues, Department of Bad Slash, Department of Implausible Crossovers, etc. So, Department of Bad Songfic (or maybe something other than &quot;Bad,&quot; so it wouldn&#39;t share an acronym with Bad Slash) would fit right in.<br><br>2.

            <p>I think the author of the essay must&#39;ve been someone whose friend got PPC&#39;ed or Sue-shamed somehow.  Mary Sues aren&#39;t female empowerment characters -- often they act shallow and vapid and replace strong female characters.<br><br>I can&#39;t say anything that hasn&#39;t already been said.  All I can say is this: I&#39;ve written rants when someone gave me hard crit.  Long-winded rants, sometimes.  This piece of pseudo-academia, though, takes the cake.  It&#39;s giving a mature mask to an otherwise immature reaction.  Mary Sues are unacceptable.  In fact, sometimes the Sues are bullies in their own right.<br><br>I only wish I&#39;d discovered the PPC boards sooner, so I could have given my two cents in the heat of this battle.  Right now, I have to settle for comfortably smouldering.</p>

            <p>...by being caught up in real life concerns. Silly me. <br><br>I found out about all this brouhaha today by reading a post on Geek Feminism that was much more concise and in the same vein as Mary Sue sporking = misogyny, bullying, and <i>marginalization of women writers</i>.<br><br>It&#39;s the last part that really bugs me. There is marginalization of women writers -- it is real, and needs to be addressed. Honest criticism of bad writing =/= not being able to get published in fantasy or sci-fi unless you take a male name (CJ Cherryh is who I&#39;m referencing specifically). Female writers are still marginalized, especially in &#39;genre&#39; writing. <br><br>But no, instead of addressing problems in the book-publishing industry, let&#39;s say that sporking is the real problem here. <br><br>Give me a break. <br><br>You know, I&#39;m a feminist, and proud of it...I understand -- I really do -- that there is misogyny and abuse in telling people to grow a thicker skin when they&#39;re dealing with real marginalization. I deal with it every day. If I can&#39;t get published because I&#39;m a woman and you tell me to grow a thicker skin, that is misogynistic. Telling me my writing is what&#39;s preventing me from getting published because my characters are unbelievable, or my setting sucks, or my dialogue isn&#39;t connected well enough (which is a real problem in my writing that I&#39;ve been working on), is not misogyny. It is criticism.<br><br>(Now, if you specifically said my characters were unbelievable because most of them are women and strong and defy traditional gender roles, then yeah -- sexism right there. But that&#39;s not the same as saying &quot;This passage is awkward, and your MFC seems a bit OOC.&quot; Not at all.)<br><br>Also, what I find very interesting is that it seems okay to criticize bad writers if they&#39;re male, or have a male OC that warps the canon. How is it feminist to want to give women special treatment because they can&#39;t handle criticism?  <br><br>There are not enough <i>headdesks</i> in the WORLD for this. </p>

The difference is in the why - we&#39;re being accused of simply being mean, when we&#39;re in fact railing at bad writing when the characteristics of bad writing are defined by a culture that automatically views women as lesser.&quot;<br><br>I may have worded that poorly.  What I mean to say is that we don&#39;t go after bad writers because they happen to be preeteen and/or female, but because they&#39;re <i>bad writers</i>.  To me at least, gender, age, and demographic are meaningless against the fact that their writing makes me want to <i>punch babies</i>.  And I can buy that we bully, but it is certainly less awful that the bullying they do against us and any other well meaning reviewer by lashing out at any critical opinion and siccing well-meaning but misguided white knights on them.<br><br>&quot;But fanfic does. Being at odds with canon continuity is not a crime. Doing so without justification and without suitable storytelling ability to make it believable is.&quot;<br><br>Maybe its just me, but I figure the original author and anyone s/he has designated as official writers for a canon as the ultimate authority on the canon, thus it irks me to no end, especially when an author claims they know more about the canon than the creator! <br><br>&quot;Um. Bullcrap. Try being female.&quot;<br><br>Listen, I&#39;m all about female empowerment.  I believe anything a man can do a woman can do.  However, it seems that half the feminists (like Boosette and her ilk) are whiny victims while the other half are the feminazis that believe women should be superior in every way.  Please tell me I&#39;m wrong, but not that I&#39;m a mysoginist because I <i>do</i> want gender equality.</p>

            <p>As flattered as some people might be at a paean to the Good and Mighty PPC, I for one feel uncomfortable with it.

            <p>*breathes in*<br><br>*breathes out*<br><br>Right. So. This discussion seems to be approaching a point at which it will no longer be productive for anyone. That means it&#39;s time to take a step back and attempt to regain some objectivity.<br><br>Let&#39;s be clear about a couple of things:<br><br>1. Boosette and her friends don&#39;t like the way we do things. That&#39;s okay--they have that right. Yes, even if they don&#39;t precisely understand our point of view.<br><br>2. We don&#39;t agree with the majority of what she said about us, or how she said it. That&#39;s okay, too.<br><br>To sum up, everyone is entitled to their own opinion. Right? Right.<br><br>Now then. I think most of us would be fairly happy to quietly go back to business as usual, without further unpleasantness, but if we want to continue a dialogue with our fellow human beings, we&#39;re going to have to cool our heads and come up with an actual line of communication, &#39;cause what&#39;s happening right now doesn&#39;t count--it&#39;s more akin to shouting at each other from either side of a ravine. We&#39;ve done the whole &quot;circle the wagons&quot; thing; to switch metaphors, we&#39;ve also run up the colors and fired a warning shot across the bows. Now it&#39;s time for parley, if they&#39;ll have it, or surrender if not. Because this isn&#39;t war, and we don&#39;t want war. We just want to get the facts straight.<br><br>However that may be, let&#39;s be clear about one more thing for ourselves: we&#39;ve received a critique, and we of all people ought to respect that. We may not agree with all of it, we may not like the form it&#39;s taken, but hey, we can take it, right? And some important issues in our community have come to light because of it. I believe those issues deserve their own thread, up at the top where everyone will see it, so I&#39;m going to start one tomorrow, after I&#39;ve slept and had some time to compose my thoughts some more. Keep an eye out for it.<br><br>In the meantime, don&#39;t anybody say anything, here or anywhere else, without thinking it through first, all right? Let&#39;s not let this get out of hand.<br><br>~Neshomeh, moderating.</p>

            <p>So, since this is a wide-open public forum, well known organization, and very well known by some of the people with boosette, <s>and because I (and probably other people) told them,</s> they eventually got around to answering this thread/Araeph&#39;s response. Bear in mind that the following is a quote from the person who directed me to this &#39;Board about five years ago, and the person who is responsible for me actually writing like a coherent adult, and not (A/N: LOLZ lyk dis!!!) anymore. It&#39;s not some ignorant, just-stepped-into-fanfic kid who&#39;s got her feathers ruffled.<br><br>&quot;We don&#39;t need to do a rebuttal to their argument. We&#39;ve already won. The vast majority of fandom agrees with us, and is sick of being shamed and harassed for what they write. The PPC can think they&#39;re right and correct and the good guys all they like; we really don&#39;t care, because we (despite their protestations) aren&#39;t bullying people weaker than us, and they are.&quot;<br><br><a href="http://so-sue-me.dreamwidth.org/4269.html">This</a>, though, is the community&#39;s response. Or as much as we&#39;re going to get.<br><br>Personally, I dislike much of this thread here, especially the part where people go &quot;Oh, but we don&#39;t target <i>canons</i>, so she didn&#39;t do the research!&quot; If I had any real interest, I&#39;d go back and find all the times people have labeled a character Canon Sue/Stu. I&#39;ve had entire debates on whether Tamora Pierce&#39;s characters (most of them, not all) fit the bill. No, we don&#39;t target canons in missions, but there are <i>plenty</i> of people who have asked to, over the years. I will say that we do target both male and female targets, so I&#39;m not certain about the &quot;anti-feminist!&quot; thing. That&#39;s a bit out of line.<br><br>But their points about being unnecessarily harsh and cruel struck a chord with me. I got a bit upset when I realized that nobody really seems to bother giving authors concrit anymore, if they want to just eviscerate the story. That bothers me. If our interests are in trying to improve fandom, shouldn&#39;t we try to help people improve? I know most of the people on here started out writing utter shit, I sure as hell did, and would we have improved if no one had ever bothered pointing out-- nicely or mockingly-- our flaws, and <b>how to fix them</b>? <br><br>More to the point, we can go on and on and on about how Sues really are horrible horrible horrible things, and personally I&#39;m not a fan of OOC or bad syntax, but in the Constitution itself, it says <br><br>&quot;17. Mary Sues are generally despised and though most of the Regulars will (probably) treat you with respect if you like them, this Board is not the best place for you. <br><br><s>18. If you hate Lord of the Rings, this Board is definitely NOT the place for you. You’ll find pretty much everyone here in disagreement with you.</s>&quot;<br><br>Mary Sues are GENERALLY DESPISED. Not The Evil That Stalks Us All In Everything. Just... we don&#39;t like them. Okay. But it also says no flaming, and that Regulars should treat their fans with respect (at least, all the other parts of the Constitution lean that way on top of it).<br><br>But there&#39;s also a rule against flaming, and against abuse, and I have seriously been somewhat freaked out by the number of people around here who seem to quietly applaud trolling and flaming. That&#39;s not helpful. Part of my problem with Boosette&#39;s rant was that she seemed to lump us, a bunch of people who I&#39;ve always kind of thought of as fairly easygoing, definitely capable of holding a decent conversation with a badfic author if they made an effort (which has been done in the past, I think), or a debate on Sues, an intelligent debate, in with the people who post reviews like &quot;Your character is a Sue and you should die in a fire for writing her.&quot; That... that&#39;s not what the PPC is supposed to be about. <br><br>It says so in the original series. &quot;I don&#39;t like that these stories can make me a common flamer.&quot; (Jay, Children of the Earth.)<br><br>So yeah. I don&#39;t think the PPC is a herd of evil bloodthirsty wolves and bullies, but I think we walk a fine line sometimes, and it&#39;s a good idea to keep it in check. </p>

            <p>It seems as though the only way someone can be this blinded to the harms of Mary Sues is if one of her or her friend&#39;s characters has been taken down. Do we know if any of her stories has been the subject of a mission? If so, was it a particularly violent assassination? That would most likely create a feeling of dislike, especially if she had connected to the Sue, though this seems like it is rather out of proportion. A Sue team, perhaps?</p>

            <p>I&#39;m going to agree with everyone who said that Boosette has a misconception of misogyny, Mary Sues, female empowerment, and the PPC. She probably didn&#39;t look into these things much further than the basic definitions. She does have a point about bullying the Suethors, though. The PPC does have to make sure that we don&#39;t start insulting the Suethor in that sort of way. That problem isn&#39;t very common, though, so there wasn&#39;t much of a reason for Boosette to bring it up as if it were a plague. I also don&#39;t like that she neglected to mention that the PPC pretty much fits the same age group as fanfiction authors. And that many of us are female. And that there are male Suethors, too. <br>What really ticked me off is the fact that she seemed to imply that the PPC hates characters like Keladry of Mindelan. Keladry is my favorite character! I even like Daine, the true canon Sue of the Tortall books. (Watch out for cursing from this point on.) She&#39;s basically calling me a misogynistic, cold hearted, bullying bitch for disliking bad fanfiction, <s>which isn&#39;t too far from the truth, except for the misogynistic and bullying parts. Still...</s> <br>I&#39;m not sure why Boosette went off and wrote this essay/rant. I mean, I&#39;m pretty sure she&#39;s the same Boosette from the Goldenlake forum. That Boosette is highly opinionated, yes, but she hasn&#39;t gone off in an essay-long, meandering rant on that forum. She didn&#39;t even rail me for being a PPC agent when I blatantly made it known there from the very beginning. I sure hope she doesn&#39;t try to glean support from the Goldenlake community, though. People already think I&#39;m insane there, and this wouldn&#39;t make matters better. I&#39;m trying to make the PPC look positive to the Tortall fans, not negative. <br>Anyway, this was a very interesting essay. Thanks for linking it. </p>

            <p>...who regularly flames Mary Sues, I&#39;m guessing I&#39;m the one she imagines when she talks about the PPC. All of her points seem fairly invalid when she starts by equating Mary Sues with all strong female characters. Because that&#39;s just wrong. There&#39;s nothing feminist about bad writing, even if it is glorifying women. Mary Sue isn&#39;t applied to strong women, just badly written strong women who aren&#39;t part of a regular continuity. I write strong female characters all the time. Hell, I love strong women. That&#39;s why this pisses me off so much.<br></p>

            <p>Nobody? Your line of questioning is odd. I prefer stories with strong female leads. I read and write stories with strong female leads.

            <p>There&#39;s this OFC I like. She&#39;s friends with the best con man in the world even though she&#39;s married to the FBI agent who sent him to prison. She&#39;s stubborn and emotional and sharp as a whip, and even though she could do anything in the world she has a job where she makes things pretty because she loves it. Sometimes she gets hysterical and her husband leaves his job to come home and fix the things that are making her hysterical. And she once had her office torn apart by the bad guys! And then her straight-laced husband PUNCHED THE BAD GUY IN THE FACE and it was awesome and he got suspended for it. Also she&#39;s gorgeous and she&#39;s shaped kindof like me, ie: round. Which might have something to do with her actress being pregnant, but a girl can wallow in vicariously sized awesome for as long as it&#39;s available, right?<br><br>Her name is Elizabeth Burke. She&#39;s the best thing about White Collar.<br><br>There&#39;s this OFC I like. She&#39;s kindof inappropriately in love with her boss and doesn&#39;t really know what to do about it, and doesn&#39;t know that she can do anything about it. <br><br><b>Um, about right here is where you should have read up on your definitions of Mary Sue.</b><br><br>She&#39;s also the best damned helmswoman in the galaxy (otherwise she wouldn&#39;t be piloting the flagship space-vehicle), and when her captain is stupid and gets himself roofied and kidnapped and almost turned out to pasture as a stud, as it were, she takes a team down to the planet and BLOWS THE TOP OFF THE MOUNTAIN where the bad guys are keeping him. And when that appears to not work, she takes a small team inside the mountain (well: this doesn&#39;t work either, <br><br><b>Here would be good, too.</b><br><br>since all they guys on the team get left back at home, and it&#39;s just her and this other chick, and you can see where this is going, right?). So the bad guys try to make her captain choose a mate from the available females! And they tell him all about her private fantasies about him! And even though she&#39;s pretty MORTIFIED ABOUT IT, <br><br><b>Oh, definitely here. Mary Sues and mortification do not go hand in hand.</b><br><br>she helps take one of the bad guys hostage so they can escape! But then when the bad guys are twirling their collective mustaches and talking about breeding a race of artisans and stuff, she OVERLOADS HER SIDEARM TO KILL EVERYONE THERE rather than let her descendants live as genetically engineered slaves. Word of God has that she&#39;s the most beautiful, smartest, capable person on her planet for the year she was born, and that she was designed to be that way. She has lots and lots of Issues and an interpersonal inferiority complex because of this.<br><br><br>Her name is Number One. She&#39;s from the Star Trek Pilot film The Cage and unless you&#39;ve been living under a rock these past six months you know she is my FAVORITE thing about the Star Trek franchise.<br><br><br>There&#39;s this OFC I like. She really wanted to be a knight all her life, and she was raised in Japanalogue so she&#39;s not good at expressing her feelings, and her parents are TOTALLY BEHIND HER in becoming a knight. But the training master isn&#39;t! He doesn&#39;t believe women SHOULD be knights cause they&#39;re weak and hysterical and easily frightened! So she works REALLY HARD and makes friends and lives with people who don&#39;t like her and has a dog and birds even though pages aren&#39;t allowed to have pets. The training master even loves her dog! And she has a secret rich benefactor who equips her with the best weaponry EVER and turns out to be her childhood hero - the only other female knight in the land! And she gets crushes on all her BFFs (okay well, just the one BFF and then the BFF&#39;s cousin) and then then the commander of this really awesome division of elite soldiers PICKS HER AS HIS SQUIRE. He is hilarious and snarky and like a grown up version of Our Heroine and that&#39;s awesome. On her first mission with him she adopts a baby griffin and it&#39;s pretty much a disaster until its parents show up and DON&#39;T ACTUALLY KILL her even though griffins always kill anyone who touches their babies! And then when she finally gets her shield, she gets handed the command of a refugee camp! But it&#39;s okay because her old training master, the one who didn&#39;t believe in her? HE&#39;S CHANGED HIS MIND. She&#39;s the only one he TRUSTS enough for the job! Nobody else would be able to do it RIGHT! And at the end after lots of action and kidnappings and questing to slay the bad guy, she comes home and she&#39;s not hanged as a traitor even though she committed treason by disobeying a direct order from her liege during wartime!<br><br>Her name is Keladry of Mindelan, from Tamora Pierce&#39;s Protector of the Small, and I LOVE HER LOTS.<br><br><b>Oh, I love Keladry of Mindelan to the ends of the earth. She’s one wonderful character, not least because she worked her ass off every waking moment to achieve all that she did and had a crippling fear of heights that almost prevented her from rising to knighthood. She’s a much better character than SuperSue Veralidaine Sarrasri. <br>Hmm, something in common. At least we’re off to a good start!</b><br><br>*<br><br><br>Gene Roddenberry married Number One&#39;s actress. Tamora Pierce is on-record as having said that Kel is her favorite character to write.<br><br>You can see where I&#39;m going with this. <br><br><b>Yes, and good old trodden ground it is, too: the unfortunate misconception that because we don’t share your opinion that Mary Sues are awesome and cool characters, that we automatically MUST dislike all female characters who actually ARE awesome and cool!</b><br><br>Writing these women as they appear in canon would constitute writing them as &quot;Mary Sues&quot; -- They&#39;re special. They&#39;re competent, they&#39;re attractive, they have weaknesses and insecurities <br><br><b>It baffles me why anyone would post a long rant in support of Mary Sues without knowing exactly what a Mary Sue <i>is</i>.</b><br><br>and by virtue of being protagonists and first-string supporting characters, they warp plots and universes and other characters to their needs. <br><br><b>You can only “warp” a story to your needs if it didn’t revolve around you in the first place. A world revolving around a main character is only a problem if the story is fanfic and a Sue has replaced a canon character as the protagonist.</b><br><br>Elizabeth is Peter Burke&#39;s greatest weakness; Kel talks to the king and gets him to rescind a law she doesn&#39;t like; Number One is executive officer of the Federation Starfleet flagship despite being only a lieutenant and is &quot;the most experienced officer on the ship,&quot; second to Pike himself, to boot.<br><br>These characters are awesome. No really, look at these characters: how awesome are they?<br><br><b>I’m not familiar with the other two characters, but they sound a helluva lot better than Marty Stu Eragon or what’s-his-face from Twilight.</b> <br><br>*<br><br>Once upon a time, the term &quot;Mary Sue&quot; was a value-neutral genre descriptor: <br><br><b>Hah!</b><br><br>Original (female, let&#39;s be real here) <br><br><b>Yes, denying Marty Stu’s existence is always a good idea.</b><br><br>characters who entered the story, won the admiration of all the canon characters around her, who won the day and maybe developed a romantic relationship with one or more of said canon characters (usually the author&#39;s favorite).<br><br>Pat Pflieger writes her paper, 150 Years of Mary Sue: <br><i>The Cinderella portrayed by Drew Barrymore in the movie Ever After, especially, is everything that defines the Mary Sue -- intelligent, funny, beautiful, physically strong, competent, lovable -- but there isn&#39;t the hint of self-deprecation we see in some of the Mary Sues cited above. From Schumann&#39;s paper, we get a sense that young teenaged girls now aren&#39;t as willing to abdicate their natural powers as were girls of previous generations; it&#39;s their right to be competent and strong, and to carry off the occasional prince over their shoulders.</i> <br><br>The term was coined in 1974. It is not the value-neutral term it once was, and you only have to look so far as Protectors of the Plot Continuum (PPC) to see this for yourself. Or Godawful Fanfiction. Or  marysues, or  deleterius, or ... <br><br>Let&#39;s look at PPC. The website intro reads:<br><br><i>But changing the *main plotline* of the canon story is ridiculous. (Except in speculative AU &quot;what-if&quot; type stories.) And Mary Sues upstage the canonical main characters, which really should not happen. If you want to be the main character, try doing original fiction. Then you can even publish it without breaking copyright laws, maybe even get rich. But if you do that, please knock your character down a few notches from &quot;angel&quot;.</i> <br><br><b>*grins* Jay and Acacia. Gotta love ’em.</b><br><br>The Fanlore description of PPC reads:<br><br><i>Protectors of the Plot Continuum, often abreviated PPC, is a cross between sporking and an RPG. The PPC is an organisation dedicated to the elimination of badfic. It is divided into various departments such as the Department of Mary Sues and the Department of Bad Slash. Writers create characters called Agents who go into badfic, spork the story, and fix it by killing Mary Sues, exorcising OOC characters, and otherwise restoring the story universe back to its original state.</i> <br><br>Translated, roughly: <br><br><b>If by “roughly” you mean “like Babelfish on 40 proof,” then yes, your explanation of what the PPC does is indeed a translation.</b><br><br>PPC goes around bullying tweens, teens, young women and yes: older women, too –<br><br><b>You could have just said “PPC goes around bullying people who write Sues”; the fact that you didn’t, coupled with your choice to list “tweens” first, suggests that you are making age a factor in your “bully” argument.<br><br>Funnily enough, “Tweens, teens, young women, and yes: older women, too—” is exactly how I would describe the members of the PPC themselves. We have some younger members, and some older members; almost all of us are young women. When we started out, the average age of a PPCer was a whopping <i>sixteen years old.</i>  It has since gone up to *gasp* twenty and a half. We’re almost old enough to drink, we are! <br><br>For the most part, Suethors actually share our gender and age bracket. So, there is no need to bring up the youth of Suethors in your argument. (There is no need to bring up their gender, either, but I will address that part momentarily.)</b><br><br>for daring to write fanfiction not up to their (dubious) standards.<br><br><b>Hoo boy, there’s a lot of ground to cover with that one phrase.<br><br>Let’s start with:<br><br>1.     Please explain to me how writers are “daring” anything when creating a fanfic Mary Sue. Yes, PPC and GAFF and the like make fun of Mary Sues, but if you look at any major fandom—LotR, HP, PotC, Star Trek—and calculate the ratio of Mary Sue authors to Mary Sue mockers…I’m afraid we are badly, badly, outnumbered. In fact, having one’s Suefic mocked by the PPC is akin to being struck by lightning in its rarity. Heck, if you want to write what everyone else in fandom is writing, get lots of reviews from like-minded writers, and have fellow writers come to your defense for any criticism whatsoever of your beloved fic, Mary Sue is the way to go! She’s not defying convention. She IS the convention.<br><br>2.  <i>We</i> set the standards for good and bad fanfiction? We did no such thing. <br> The original story, the canon, set all those standards far better than we ever could. All we do is remind fans what those standards are.<br>    And yes, writing fanfic that’s as good as canon is still a bar most fans can’t hope to  reach. But you see, Boosette, the PPC doesn’t look for fic to mock near the bar. It looks past the bar beneath that bar, and the bar under that, and finally peels back the mat underneath the lowest bar and boggles at the grime found underneath. The stories by supposed fans who seem to have forgotten that the high bar even exists. <br><br>3.    Please explain to me which of our standards you find to be dubious, and why.</b><br><br>For writing original female characters, minor canon characters and major canon characters in a manner that is empowering to them. <br><br><b>Again, we seem to have so much in common! We too write original female canon characters, minor canon characters, and major canon characters is a manner that is empowering to us. But unlike the Suethors, we understand that just <i>giving</i> a character heaps and heaps of power for no reason isn’t empowering. Neither is stomping all over the personality of a well-developed canon character just to puff up Sue’s ego. It doesn’t make the Mary Sue better, or as special as the author thinks she is. After all, any author can rain a golden shower of gifts on a pet character; why does that make the character great?<br><br>What is empowering is allowing a character to <i>earn</i> power for herself by virtue of the conflicts that arise in a story. Even having a character try to earn power and fail honorably is more empowering than just imbuing a character with incredible abilities and watching her take out ridiculously enervated villains. <br><br>Ultimately, Mary Sue is bowling-with-bumpers safe as a way to experience a story. She is unrealistically beautiful, inhumanly powerful, and always gets rewarded for everything she does with only the barest of struggles. She can’t fail. She can’t get humiliated. The story itself will dutifully remove all real obstacles from her shining path. And a character who needs her author to do all that work <i>for</i> her is not a character who has any sort of power. On the contrary, that character is weak.<br></b></p>

            <p>It&#39;s too late now, as the link has been sent, but there is pleanty of &quot;point&quot; in writing a long response without showing it to her - affirming things for ourselves. Several people around here have been wondering if her argument does indeed mean they are bad people, or behaving badly; as a community, we have every right to go on a long spiel to console each other, but deliberately sending it to someone who is already arguing with us is another matter.<br><br>And I doubt opinions can be changed - certainly not in this manner. Even if the rebuttal was perfect, people don&#39;t take kindly to &#39;being wrong&#39;, and there is a whole community out there who will stick together. They&#39;re not going to roll over and show their bellies because of a well-worded response. I also don&#39;t think it&#39;s any of our business to try and make someone&#39;s opinion change; if she doesn&#39;t like us, I&#39;m sorry, but she can&#39;t ban us from the Internet and so there&#39;s no real harm that can be done.

            <p>I was thinking of comparing her to the <i>Klu Klux Klan</i>.

I may only be a special case, and one that doesn&#39;t apply to you. I just want Sedri to know that there is one more person who agrees with her. If I insulted you, i&#39;m sorry.

            <p>...I judged that it was a safe bet. If I&#39;m wrong, I&#39;m the one who both wrote the essay and sent her the link; if she does want to &quot;fight&quot;, it&#39;ll probably be just against me, and she&#39;ll probably keep it on her own journal. <br><br>Other Suethors might come to our Board and provoke a flame war, but I think the chances of that happening here are small. The reason is that, at the end of her tirade, Boosette tells anyone who disagrees with her that they are welcome to &quot;shut their mouths&quot; on her journal, because it is her &quot;safe space&quot;. She has also screened her journal not only to ban anonymous comments, but to ban comments from anyone who isn&#39;t on her &quot;Access List.&quot; This leads me to believe that she doesn&#39;t feel nearly as confident giving an opinion so vocally when she&#39;s on a site devoid of a legion of loyal defenders. And since I gave her a link to the essay on LJ, rather than the Board, the chances of spammage here are much reduced. <br><br></p>

For empowering themselves through their writing.<br><br><b>…<br><br>You <i>do</i> know that the number of Mary Sues who force their way into the main plotline by humiliating or killing off strong female characters that were already there <u>far exceeds</u> the number of Mary Sues who actually support the female canon characters’ agency and right to their own love interests, don’t you?<br><br>You <i>do</i> know that the strong female canon characters who are warped into Mary Sues in fanfiction almost always get, not just sooper speshul abilities, but physical transformations to make them more physically appealing to men?  <br><br>That’s the problem with Mary Sue. Her incessant need to hog the spotlight means she tramples over characters, timelines, plots, romances, deaths, and births, just so she can exist. In doing so, she disparages some of our most beloved, and if you will, <i>empowered</i> female characters!<br><br>You are mistaken if you think that Mary Sue cares about female empowerment. Mary Sue only cares about empowering Mary Sue. She will wreak havoc on every existing character, and as mentioned before, her treatment of pre-existing female characters is <i>particularly</i> shabby. At least the canon male love interest for the Sue only gets a fanfic lobotomy. But the unfortunate female canon characters who were originally paired with the canon males…well, it’s probably best just to continue with my response, rather than think of some of the things I’ve seen done to get a strong female canon character out of the way of a Sue.</b><br><br>The Call of Mary Sue isn&#39;t just limited to PPC, of course, nor is the mission directive: Check out  deleterius&#39;s userinfo page:<br><br><i>If you find your story here and are upset about it, try to relax.<br>There are reasons you should try to relax:<br>1. Throwing a tempter tantrum will only serve to amuse us further.<br>2. Amusing us further will cause us to sink our claws and teeth in deeper.<br>3. Throwing a temper tantrum will not incite me to remove your fic. So long as no LJ TOS issues are being violated, it will stay posted. Don&#39;t like it? Sucks to be you.<br>4. &quot;But it&#39;s fanFICTION, I can do whatever I want!&quot; No, you can&#39;t. Move along.</i><br><br>And from the linked rant, by  magdaleina (in 2005, I will grant you: ancient internet history, back before we talked about why this sort of thing was even discussed, before anyone had bothered questioning whether this behavior was bullying, was harassment, was anything other than okay.).<br><br><b>I’m not sure why you think that people weren’t questioning us in 2005. People have been ranting against the PPC and its allies since its inception in 2001! As for the LJ comms, a Suethor whose work was featured on <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/marysues/207184.html">Marysues</a> waaay back in 2003 very kindly (and in such a feminist way!) called the community “a world full of bitches and lesbos”. We’ve taken it all in stride, really. <br><br>However, criticizing a story and criticizing a person are two very different things. I hope you have noticed that, whatever I have said so far about Mary Sues, I have refrained from insulting anything about the Suethors except their writing. It’s PPC policy to do the same on missions. <br><br>Anyone has been welcome, at any time, to critique the PPC’s own writing style. (We would hope, of course, for it to be a well-written, funny, and entertaining piece of writing.) In fact, someone did that a long time ago. The result? We <a href="http://www.misssandman.com/PPC/Ashes.html">hosted</a> that story on our own website. Yep, we sure are evil and oppressive.</b><br><br>What those intimidated by criticism fail to realize is that they needn&#39;t remind anyone -- specifically not a fan of a book who actually read it -- that their work is fiction (because half the time, the reviewer would rather not believe the story was ever written, much less whether it&#39;s real or not). What a reviewer is actually questioning is the merit of the writer&#39;s fandom; whether or not they are a true fan.<br><br>Instead of, &quot;write to the best of your ability&quot;, the message is: Don&#39;t you dare write characters who are too perfect! Don&#39;t you dare write characters who are too flawed! Don&#39;t you dare make your characters too forthright or too timid, too connected to canon characters or not connected enough! <br><br><b>I would really like to know where it is said or implied in any of our archives that a Suethor’s character might be <i>too flawed</i>. But to get back to the point…Suethors can write self-inserts who are as perfect as they like.

Well known sporker Pottersues came up with the term from a Harry Potter fanfic where the author repeatedly mentioned that Hermione liked pepper jack cheese (which isn&#39;t available in the UK) just because it was the author&#39;s favourite cheese.</i><br><br><b>Every author puts some of his/herself into a character; to pretend otherwise would be foolish. But there’s a difference between putting some of yourself into a character and making a self-insertion. And if you don&#39;t know the difference between those two things, you really have no business posting an essay on Mary Sues.</b><br><br>And if you do, if you dare: we&#39;ll make fun of you for it, we&#39;ll mock you for it, we&#39;ll question your worth as a writer and as a person <br><br><b>Show me the place where we have questioned a Suethor’s worth as a human being, and I’ll show you Napoleon bungee-jumping off Mount Everest.</b><br><br>behind your back! <br><br><b>Ah, so you think we should mock their stories to their faces? Well, believe me, we’ve tried. It never ends well…for either us or them. What ends up happening is:<br>1.  Suethor throws a temper tantrum.<br>2. All her friends join in. They resort to personal attacks first, not the other way around. <br>3.  Since we don’t really care what Suethors think of us, instead of being contrite or angry, we are heartily amused. Sometimes, we’ll try to explain what we were trying to do, to no avail.<br>4. Inevitably, the Suethor gets even more upset that we aren’t mending our vile ways, and resorts to sockpuppetry so she may defend her shoddy writing more vocally.<br>5. When this doesn’t work, she will take things a step further and try to get the PPCing or sporking removed from whatever site it’s hosted on. <br><br>And that last one is the clincher, really. We never...ever…ever try to get a Suefic taken off fanfiction.net unless is it blatantly violating the Terms of Service.  But Suethors will try to get our mockery removed for no reason other than that they want it gone. Since this has often worked even though we are careful not to violate posting rules, it’s enough of a hassle that we have learned to keep the mockery among those who will actually appreciate it.<br><br>(Of course, even if we offer up constructive criticism in a polite review with no mention of the PPC or mockery, 1. and 2. will usually happen anyway. Bless fandom and its huge sense of entitlement about positive feedback!)</b><br><br>We&#39;ll dogpile you and we&#39;ll get all of our friends to tell you you&#39;re wrong-wrong-wrong for daring to question us, <br><br><b>HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!<br><br>*wipes away tears of laughter*<br><br>I can see it now. “Shh, don’t question the PPC…<i>or else!</i>”<br><br>Boosette, the Suethors aren’t questioning us when they write their stories.  Most of them don’t even know we exist—thanks to the mocking-behind-their-backs policy that you so derided, the vast majority live on in blissful ignorance that a single bad word has been said about their idealized, emerald-eyed creations.<br><br><i>We’re</i> the ones questioning their writing. They’re just typing up whatever they jolly well feel like no matter how terrible it is, posting it in a public place for all to see, demanding feedback for this very poor fanfiction, and then complaining if the feedback is negative.</b><br><br>to defend yourself, and if we&#39;re feeling really ambitious we&#39;ll make you cry and then laugh about it!<br><br>And yeah, this bears a remarkable resemblance to the bullying a goodly number of us experienced as geeky misfits, growing up.<br><br><b>Geeky misfits. Again, an epithet most members of the PPC would proudly say applied to them—much more than the Suethors, in this case, because geeks are actually familiar with and have a respect for the source material(s) that they claim to be fans of.</b><br><br>This is the environment of Mary Sue. This is the context and the history, today, of Mary Sue. <br><br><b>That is <i>your</i> history of Mary Sue. Here’s my preferred version, from PotCverse:<br><br>Once upon a time, there was a movie. It was fun, witty, and thoroughly enjoyable. Many people loved this movie, for various reasons. Some loved it for the scathing one-liners, some for the fact that it was a pirate movie, and some loved it for its technical aspects, such as costumes and sea battles, and whatnot. <br><br>And there were those who loved this movie for two (and sometimes three) reasons. These reasons had nothing to do with the movie, not really. They mainly had to do with how H0TT!!!1! the three male leads were. Now, these reasons, while decent reasons when compiled with others, were very shallow on their own. But many ignored this fact, and focused on the hormone induced lusting of t3h h0ttn355 of the leads. <br><br>Some lusted after these men in the quiet of their own minds, and it was good. Everyone has fantasies, after all. But there were others who decided they absolutely HAD to share these idle daydreams with the rest of the world. So, they wrote down these fantasies, and posted them on a notorious website known as fanfiction.net. <br><br>In all fairness, there were some fantasies that were very well done. They were cohesive, and enriched the original plot of the movie. And the fans who read these stories were very, very happy. And then there were other fantasies. These stories were crude, poorly crafted, and irritating. And the fans wept with rage and sadness, seeing their beloved movie being turned into a playground for pubescent teenagers. <br><br>The fans watched as the main character of the movie fell in love again and again with a girl named Mary Sue. Mary Sue came in many shapes and sizes, but it was she the entire time. Each time Mary Sue made someone fall in love with her, something was lost. A little bit of the magic that made everyone adore this movie died. The more Mary Sue appeared, the more the magic died. Pretty soon, the universe the movie took place in was unrecognizable. And the true fans wept.<br><br>Moral of the story? Your Mary Sue kills canon.</b><br><br>So to abandon for a moment my quasi-professional tone: <br><br><b>Your tone was quasi-professional?</b><br><br>If you think that you can use &quot;Mary Sue&quot; as a value-neutral term in this environment, and with this history, you are contributing to the environment which approves and encourages the bullying and harassment of women for the sin of daring -- daring! -- to write characters in such a way that is empowering to them.<br><br><b>Mary Sue is not defined in any dictionary as “empowered/strong female character.” Mary Sue is only a fantasy of what her author wants to be, and all too often what the author thinks men want her to be. In fanfiction in particular, this involves:<br><br>-An obscene emphasis on a pre-determined model of beauty.<br>-The idea that <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/heave_ho/15220.html?thread=187508#t187508">romantic love is superior</a> to all other relationships.<br>-The obligatory <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/heave_ho/19126.html">male-rescues-female-from-rape-and-she-falls-for-him</a> scenes that populate at least half of her stories. (Or worse, the obligatory <a href="http://potcsues.livejournal.com/10970.html">male-rapes-female-and-she-falls-for-him</a> stories! Bleaugh.) <br>-The cheap way her author portrays sensitive issues like <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/heave_ho/22681.html">abuse</a>, <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/heave_ho/63586.html">abandonment</a>, and <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/heave_ho/53341.html">prostitution</a>—as simply devices to get a quick pity-fix for her heroine.<br>-A penchant for <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Designated_Misogynistic_Bastard">manufacturing misogyny</a> in an otherwise egalitarian universe in order to “prove” that she is good or better than men.<br>-<a href="http://community.livejournal.com/heave_ho/55763.html">A disturbingly high tolerance for controlling, tyrannical love interests as long as they are hawt.</a><br><br>None of these things has anything to do with real empowerment. But all of them have to do with the fundamental selfishness that defines Mary Sue—the fundamental idea that she is better than everyone, that only she can be better than everyone, that the whole rest of the world had better stand back in awe at her awesomeness…and most of all, that anyone in the story who doesn’t respect her will fear her. Because if they don’t, they will suffer the author’s, I mean her, swift and terrible retribution.</b><br><br>Writing &quot;Mary Sues&quot; is empowering. Writing them being awesome is empowering. Calling Mary Sue, and contributing to an environment such as the above, which encourages the denigration of female awesomeness in fiction, <br><br><b>As a GAFFer once said...Mary Sue is <i>not a hero</i>. She usually doesn&#39;t have one single thing going for her that makes me respect and adore her, the way that the author OBVIOUSLY expects me to do. I don&#39;t find these supposedly perfect people who get all good things without so much as struggling for it interesting. I never got anything for free, why should they?<br><br>A reward, or a victory, is so much sweeter when you&#39;ve fought for it - I know this from my own, personal experience - and THAT&#39;S the sort of feel-good entertainment that I want! I want to see the long struggle. I want to be inside the character&#39;s head as he&#39;s overcoming all his difficulties... at the end of the book, I want to cry with happiness. I want to feel that all that hard work, all that suffering and struggling, PAID OFF! <br><br>Mary-Sue has too easy a time - as much as I might LIKE to identify with her, I can&#39;t. I want my heroes to EARN their feel-good, like I&#39;ve done, because that&#39;s an INFINITELY greater feeling than just getting everything for free... like Mary Sue does.</b><br><br>which encourages the bullying and harassment of participants in female awesome, is participating in that culture. <br><br>Calling &quot;Mary Sue&quot; in this environment is <i>shaming women for empowering themselves.</i><br><br><b>Then our environments are very different. Calling “Mary Sue” in the PPC is telling a flat, unrealistic, stereotypical character exactly what she is, so that a three-dimensional character (the Agent)—who is usually female herself, I might add—can get rid of Mary Sue and her canon-warping ways and enjoy a good fandom in peace.<br><br>Maybe you should come over to our environment. It’s climate-controlled and story-centric.</b><br></p>

            <p>There is no substantive harm in writing a &quot;Mary Sue&quot; -- there is no substantive harm in creating a character, original or otherwise, who &quot;warps the world around them&quot;, who is &quot;adored by all for no particular reason&quot;, who wins the day.<br><br><b>Even if the character perpetuates <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/heave_ho/55763.html">all</a> the most <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/heave_ho/53341.html">damaging</a> Harlequin romance novel clichйs? <br><br>Even if the character insults and degrades a beloved character of yours? (And if you say to me, “It’s only a story,” I will say to you, “Then why are you so upset about us mocking <i>only</i> stories”?)<br><br>Even if all the female OCs in a fandom are lily-white, silky-haired, green- or blue-eyed, and anorexic-thin with huge breasts, because the Suethors honestly can’t imagine that their real selves would be attractive to a male hero, so they give themselves imaginary extreme makeovers to win their idol’s heart?<br><br>Sue-mocking isn’t about female characters being too powerful, Boosette. It’s about <i>any</i> character being too powerful and too perfect with too few negative consequences. The nature of the medium (fanfiction) means that most Suethors happen to be female, not that the PPC is specifically out to get female Suethors. <br><br>But here’s some real harm, if you want it: Mary Sue, in all her super special glory, continues the very wrong idea that superb female achievement can only be won in an exaggerated, fictional scenario.<br><br>Who cares, really, if fantastic SuperPunkRockGoddess triumphed over Persephone and won Hades’ heart? There was never any doubt! What does it matter if Riellanaiлlvaniela defeated ten legions of orcs in your fanfic? It doesn’t say a thing, good or bad, about what a real woman, a real person, could actually do or not do! All it says is that someone wanted it to be true, but didn’t really believe it could be, because the scenario itself is not believable in the context of that particular universe. And worse, it implies that an ordinary woman—a woman who gets a man she loves but sweats and smells during training, a woman who is not as physically strong as an orc but wins the fight through sheer determination, a woman who achieved greatness but learned the cost was high, as all great people do—simply could not measure up, so a super-powered one had to do.<br><br>Truth is, without authorial interference, a Sue divested of all her special attributes would be just a cardboard cut-out that a realistic woman could crush beneath her feet.</b><br><br>There is substantive harm in bullying and shaming real people for empowering themselves through their writing. <br><br><b>If Mary Sue truly “empowered” these authors, then wouldn’t the authors act more, well empowered? Wouldn’t the authors be mature enough not to be flustered and go into shrieking conniptions when some stranger on the Internet happened to not like their story? Wouldn’t the authors say, “Hey, my heroine can do anything regardless of what all those people think…and so can I”? Wouldn’t they say, “My character is so awesome, she can take any attacks thrown at her from obnoxious reviewers”? Or even, heaven forbid, “Maybe they have a point, and I can write better”?<br><br>Let me tell you, a reaction like that from a Suethor would make me very happy. Yet Mary Sue’s presence in a piece of fiction seems to make the author more sensitive to criticism, more entitled to praise, more overprotective of the Mary Sue. Because the Mary Sue is so much the author’s darling, so much the author’s insertion and avatar, that the author has trouble separating her Sue from herself. And that is not the mark of a character who makes her author stronger.</b><br><br>Words have power. Words cause harm. Words hurt, and the wounds they leave are deeper and longer-lasting than many physical wounds.<br><br><b>We know that words have power. That’s why we don’t like Mary Sue messing with the words of stories that we love.</b><br><br>I nearly stopped writing entirely, as a teen, after having my work and my OC called &quot;Mary Sue&quot;. I have friends who <i>did</i> stop writing because of it.<br><br><b>Do you know how many of us PPCers have written Mary Sues in the past? Almost all of us. And the only reasons we stopped creating them were: we grew out of it, or someone actually had the honesty to call us on it. (Option B being the more frequent occurrence.)<br><br>You know, when I was looking through some of my younger writings, I had several of my cherished OCs called “Mary Sue.” By me. But also indirectly by my dad, who years ago tried to hammer into my skull the fact that my “kickass” femmes weren’t really so kickass if I had to write all the male characters and antagonists as lumbering, bumbling idiots in order to make my Sues seem that superior. (If there’s one thing a Mary Sue can’t stand, it’s a real, true, honest-to-goodness challenge at which there’s a chance she’ll get bested.) Back then, I didn’t understand what he meant. I wish I had. <br><br>I’m so glad that I found the PPC and realized that I was creating Mary Sues before I shipped off the unfortunate darlings to try and get a wider audience! It hurt, realizing how much work my fantasy characters needed, but it would have hurt a lot worse if I had written Suefic well into my twenties, then gotten a scathing rejection letter from a real editor as opposed to an anonymous online snarker. <br><br>My point being, I am sure that calling a character a Mary Sue—when it нs one—has caused fanfic authors pain in fandom. But I think it helped avoid pain and disappointment in many cases, too. </b><br><br>Before anyone says: &quot;Oh, they/you should just have sucked it up and grown a thicker skin! Learn to accept criticism!&quot;<br><br><b>Actually, what I was going to say was, “If you don’t think there is actually anything wrong with creating a Mary Sue, why are you so upset when people call it one?”</b><br><br>Think.<br><br>You are blaming the victims of bullying for their bullies&#39; behavior.<br><br><b>I am thinking…I am thinking back on my school days and the bullies I have seen and dealt with.<br><br>I don’t think there has ever been an occasion where a bullying “victim” chose to go to school with hair a mass of snarls, a shirt fished out of the garbage, bubble wrap shoes, and pink glitter on her nose, and yelled out to the schoolyard for all to hear, “WHAT DO U THINK?! PLS REVUE MY APEARENCE!!!”<br><br>And that is exactly what Suefic writers, with their needless plot contortions to shoehorn the Sue in, the carbon-copy characterization of “rebellious princess” or “pure flower”, their blatant refusal to let their self-inserts fail at anything, their zealous worship of the supermodel physique, and of course their endless demands for reviews, have done.</b><br><br>That is Not. Okay. Ever.<br><br>And this, ladies and gentlemen, this is the baggage the term &quot;Mary Sue&quot; comes with. This is the context. This is the culture and the environment and the experience of many, and it cannot be divorced from the term itself.<br><br>When someone says, &quot;your semantic choices are hurting me&quot; the decent human being response is to access how you can stop hurting people with your semantic choices, not to throw up your hands and go:<br><br>&quot;BUT I DON&#39;T WANNA! I LIKE MY HURTFUL WORDS!! YOU&#39;RE JUST BEING OVERSENSITIVE!!!&quot;<br><br><b>So, it’s not a decent response to call a Mary Sue (who is a fictional character) a Mary Sue, but it is decent and humane to use loaded words like “bullying”, “misogyny”, and “denigration of female awesomeness” on real people whose only crime is mocking flat fanfiction characters?<br><br>*tips her hat cordially*<br><br>Thank you, Boosette, for being a sterling example of not using cruel semantic choices on real people! You have truly shown me how not to insult the misfit geeks of fandom.<br><br>Happy ’Sueing, <br>~Araeph</b><br></p>

            <p>Hmm. This is interesting. I agree with the people who say that Mary Sue is not a feminist icon, of course, and I also agree that the author seems a bit uninformed about the actual definition of a Mary Sue.<br><br>However.<br><br>I think there are a couple of valid points made. One of them is that I think the Suethors do have a right to know if they&#39;re being mocked, although I acknowledge that that can sometimes go badly. However, although I feel a little out of line for saying this, but I agree with those below who said some of the criticism could get too harsh, and I think the PPC is in fact guilty of that. I mean, I&#39;m aware that there is a policy against directly insulting the author. I have also noticed that this policy gets obeyed about as often as the laws about downloading music for free get obeyed. There are a lot of comments along the lines of &quot;How can people possibly be this stupid?!&quot;, disregarding the fact that good writing doesn&#39;t correlate directly to intelligence; emphasis on the directly. Also, I could be wrong, but it seems to me to be a pretty common gag to have one agent beg to attack or kill the Suethor. THAT, I think, is out of line, and we could maybe lay off. I&#39;m familiar with getting pissed off, but you know, maybe reach for the chocolate first.<br><br>I don&#39;t think we&#39;re a clan of bullies or the inherent downfall of feminism or anything, and I do love the PPC, and I did enjoy the missions I&#39;m referencing, and the last thing I want is to offend anyone, so if I did, allow me to prostrate myself apologetically at your feet with a peace offering of absolutely heavenly pizza and a sincere expression of regret. But I do think a good bit more attention could be paid to the &quot;insult the Sue, not the Suethor&quot; policy.</p>

I would make the argument that it&#39;s the agents saying those things, which may be perfectly reasonable, in-character sentiments from their point of view; however, there&#39;s no doubt that the agents act as avatars for our own opinions, so it really wouldn&#39;t hurt to police our language more. Even if they also say similar things about their own authors. That&#39;s different.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I don&#39;t know, but I guess it really depends on the egregiousness. If they&#39;re insulting people, I&#39;d say go for it; ditto the infamous Bryan thing. Stuff like emoticons or general attitudes is maybe unnecessary, though, especially since it&#39;s an informal area of the thing where those things aren&#39;t really inappropriate. In-text notes, I personally would feel free to snap at the placement, but make it clear that the issue was the placement, not the content. Bottom line: Ask &quot;Am I insulting the author&#39;s writing/sense of where to put notes or am I insulting the author?&quot; Just my guesses, though.</p>

            <p>Admitting that we have our faults certainly isn&#39;t the same as saying the essay&#39;s author got it right.

I guess I&#39;d have to see them, but offhand I&#39;d say that finding Author&#39;s Notes annoying is no more offensive than finding bad writing annoying. It&#39;s just a question of phrasing: are you railing against the <i>content</i> of the note, or the <i>presence</i> of the note? If the latter, you&#39;re fine. If the former, is it because it&#39;s irrelevant and takes you out of the story, or because you disagree with it on a personal level? The first is probably okay; the second, maybe not so much.<br><br>~Neshomeh, handing out lots of pennies in pairs today.</p>

            <p>It is my opinion that author&#39;s notes have no place inside the story.

            <p>Like you, I enjoy author&#39;s notes at the beginning and/or end of a chapter--as long as they are at least partly relevant. Talking about some completely unrelated story or event is not what should go there. Talking about something that happened which inspired the story/chapter, and going into how it compares with the written version is interesting. Giving world background information (in original fiction) or little known facts that tie into what we have just/are going to read is great. In-text authors notes, however, just needlessly interrupt the action. If it is a note about a certain usage of a word, it can easily be referenced at the beginning or end, without breaking the flow. In my story for the March madness, for example, I refer to several people as &quot;servants&quot;. We think of something different now than what I was intending, so I put a note at the stating that, in the story, they have more independence than what we now associate with the word.</p>

            <p>I don&#39;t mind them at the beginning or end, most of the time.  I mean, you have to have your disclaimers and all that.  The one that I said something about was a a run-on that was made up of about 8-10 possible sentences, and bubbly information about how another story unrelated to the one I was there to read had stalled and yadda yadda it had been deleted.  Even with the extraneous information, I wouldn&#39;t have mentioned it if had not been for the terrible grammar.<br><br>In fact that entire mission, had not a single charge against canon.  It was based firstly on terrible grammar, secondly on legally impossible situations, and thirdly crimes against common sense.<br><br>And for anyone else looking in on this conversation.  The author in question is <b>not</b> a thirteen year old kid.  The author profile claimed to be a twenty year old in college.  <br><br>Not that those who are bashing us will care in the least, but if a fic sounds very young, I leave it alone.  I like the Warriors cats books, even though I am not in the target audience.  The fanfiction is particularly bad in that section of fanfiction.net.  Given the target audience of those books, many of the stories sound like they were written by kids.  They probably were.  I leave them alone.  I haven&#39;t seen anyone mocking stories that sound like they were written by children.<br><br>I find it interesting that there has been such an emphasis on the PPC being a bunch of adults picking on innocent thirteen year old kids. Are thirteen year old kids the only ones writing fanfiction these days? </p>

            <p>Maybe I&#39;ll get lynched for this someday, but I am really, really sick of seeing &#39;femenine empowerment&#39; and - worst of all - &quot;equality&quot; as a word being thrown around to justify whatever the speaker/author happens to be angry about. I&#39;m sick of it. Whether we use the actual term or not, no one can deny that Mary Sue characters are downright terrible examples of writing, and we can make fun of it if we like - just as talk show hosts or parody movie makers or whomever else in the published/public world can make fun of things. Yes, I think this woman has a point when she says that the term is being applied to broadly, but that doesn&#39;t mean it can&#39;t be used at all. I&#39;ve lost count of how many times people misuse words like &quot;dumb&quot;, &quot;irony&quot;, or _ - that doesn&#39;t mean the rest of us can&#39;t go on using them properly.<br><br>... Wow. I believe that qualifies as a rant. First in a while.<br><br>Anyway, in a slightly calmer but more disjointed fasion:<br><br>She&#39;s making too many connections that aren&#39;t there. People tend to be cruel in their critque of Mary Sues - a lot of people tend to be cruel in their critique of real life people - like politicians - as well. That doesn&#39;t mean that whomever is shouting that Bush is an idiot is empowered just because she&#39;s a woman, or that she is in any way less entitled to her opinion just because a Bush supporter (male or female) shouts her down.<br><br>Also, this writer talks about <i>context</i> and fails to acknowledge that characters like Number One are great IN CONTEXT, but shoved rudely into another character&#39;s place (say, Captain Janeway), she&#39;d be just as bad. Characters are good <i>in the stories they are written for</i>, and stories don&#39;t have room for an endless number of Great Characters.<br><br>Last, I agree with Artell - no one is making them post their work in public. <br><br><br>(I&#39;m in a rush - again - so this is all rough. I&#39;ll phrase myself better later.)</p>

            <p>is an on-going and a very interesting one. I consider myself a feminist, but the problem with feminism as a label is two-fold. First, you have the obvious extremist, &#39;militant&#39;, &#39;sex is rape&#39; feminists or the like. However, they are a minority of feminism. The second problem is that the patriarchy as it stands obviously defends itself*, and therefore is busy assigning as many negative meanings to &#39;feminism&#39; and &#39;empowerment&#39; as possible, by bringing up negative examples and exaggerating them.<br><br>Trying to switch from &#39;feminism&#39; to &#39;equalism&#39; might be an idea, but any label that feminism takes up would probably quickly get sullied by the extremists and the mainstream anyway. Therefore one might as well stick to their guns. The reason equalism is called feminism is that the female gender is still the disadvantaged gender.<br><br>How I understand feminism (and certainly there&#39;s no one true definition) is that it&#39;s about questioning existing gender roles, problematizing, even polemizing gender, and exposing the way gender is a social construct, and how our society is upholding that construct. (If you know who Judith Butler is, there you go.) I like to think of it as poking my finger in the eye of the status quo to make it notice things about itself. <br><br>Mary Sues, on the other hand (and to bring this post back to topic, phew), as stated by myself and many other, smart people here, often work within that framework of traditional gender and uphold those constructs. For instance, they can be weak female characters who must be rescued by males, whose raison d&#39;etre is to marry and bang male characters, etc. Female characters who &#39;clean up pretty&#39; and wear dresses and play the perfect wife for male canon characters. <br><br>The Sues are essentially working *in* the framework of popular culture and media, which is itself dominated by the traditional gender roles, and which helps to uphold them. They are *not*, generally, questioning or dismantling these roles. <br><br>Besides, real, actual human females have flaws just as the males.<br><br>* The patriarchy isn&#39;t a conscious beast or anything; it is merely the male-dominated world with traditional gender roles that we live in today and which dominates the discourse. It&#39;s the reason disgusting things like offensive jokes about trans people are still socially acceptable (because they are An Other and cause discomfort by problematizing gender).</p>

            <p>You brought up a point I meant to make, about those characters being okay IN CONTEXT.

            <p>It sounds like a kneejerk reaction to me, and an ill-thought-out one at that. There&#39;s a definite suggestion that women writing is good, and I&#39;m down with that, but it&#39;s coupled with an assumption that just because someone can pick up a pen and form squiggles, they should proudly display said squiggles to the world.<br><br>Having the freedom to write is a good thing. But I strongly object to the idea that writing of poor quality in a public place is &quot;empowering&quot;, and that to comment on the quality is &quot;bullying&quot;.<br><br>It seems to me that to call writing of any quality empowering simply because a woman is able to produce it in fact serves to demean women. It&#39;s patronising. Writing should be applauded, where warranted, for its own sake, not because its author has the fortune to live in a society granting (almost) all individuals the requisite education and freedom to put pen to paper. Female authors should be held to the same standards as male authors: they should be judged on the <i>quality of their writing</i>. I would mock a story written by a boy, a black person, a gay person, a disabled person, a French person, someone of any given group you care to name, if their writing was of poor quality, not because of who they are, but because <i>it is poor quality</i>. Hiding behind centuries of oppression is not a valid answer to storytelling skills in need of improvement.<br><br>Maybe all of you lot in the DMS do things differently, I don&#39;t know. But I was under the impression the PPC&#39;s raison d&#39;etre is to spork <i>bad writing</i>, whether it features Sues or not. The writer of the essay doesn&#39;t seem to have realised that. Perhaps we&#39;re giving the wrong impression somewhere. Perhaps she didn&#39;t do the research. Who knows?</p>

            <p>You should add that to Neshomeh&#39;s article addition - <i>an assumption that just because someone can pick up a pen and form squiggles, they should proudly display said squiggles to the world.</i> Very eloquant.

            <p>The essay states that a Mary Sue is an empowered female character. This is not so. A mary Sue is a character who is empowered to the point that the character literally has no flaws, has superficial flaws, or in some cases bereft of talent to give her an excuse to be rescued over and over by an object of affection. Hating them has nothing to do with misogyny.<br><br> Everyone has wish fulfillment fantasies (hell, I know I have) and most men keep them to themselves(hell I know I do) because they know that they will be ridiculed because wishing for impossible things is something you keep to yourself. Even then, there are some exceptions (Eragon, anyone?) and these are panned as well. It just so happens that teenage girls are in the category most likely to post this sort of thing online, usually involving characters from recent media. It&#39;s not discrimination against anything but the belief that bad characters are... well, bad, and a mary sue is simply an author wish fulfillment.</p>

            <p>Yes, but suethors are not expecting criticism. They are expecting everyone to love their character, just as all the characters in the story they are inserting themselves into love them..  Now, if you were just sharing your own personal story I suppose that&#39;s fine, but no human should EXPECT uniform praise when it&#39;s plainly obvious for all to see that their character is merely them with the reality and interest ironed out.</p>

            <p>It&#39;s funny to me that the author of this essay thinks PPC missions are intended as attacks against the Suethors.  Most of the mission writers I know of don&#39;t even contact the original Suethor to begin with.  The essay says writing badfic doesn&#39;t hurt anyone; well, neither do PPC missions or other sporkings.<br><br>Also, as Neshomeh mentioned already, using another term or phrase in place of &quot;Mary Sue&quot; wouldn&#39;t change the badness of the stories they appear in, or any reader&#39;s reaction to them.  To paraphrase Shakespeare, a rose will always the same flower, no matter what we may call it.</p>

            <p>Well, I do believe that PPC missions hurt the feelings of the Suethors. It&#39;s not a nice feeling when someone takes the micky out of a fic you wrote.<br><br>But I then also want recognision for the fact that some badfic actually does hurt. It gives headaches.<br><br>The standard &quot;don&#39;t like, don&#39;t read&quot; doesn&#39;t apply here. I mean Suethors don&#39;t have to read the missions into their fics. So, if my hurt can apparently stop by not reading the badfic, then their hurt can stop by not reading the PPC mission beyond the point where they established it was about their fic (and that is usually in the opening author&#39;s notes).</p>

            <p>I think she failed to demonstrate her point with her examples by failing to illustrate the connections between one and the other. Also missed the point, at least where the PPC is concerned. As Italian for Grandma said, Did Not Do The Research.<br><br>And... her entire point is that the term &quot;Mary-Sue&quot; is hurtful and shouldn&#39;t be used? Okay. I&#39;m perfectly happy to say &quot;poorly-written, unrealistic, shallow female character&quot; instead if it&#39;ll make everyone feel better. {= P<br><br>I think I would be less annoyed if I felt we could respond publicly without being told to shut up. The hypocrisy burns us, Precious!<br><br>But maybe this warrants a new entry in the FAQ For Other People...<br><br><b>Calling Mary-Sue is misogynist!</b><br>There are those who believe that sporking Mary-Sues perpetrates a culture that oppresses young women trying to empower themselves through their writing, and that the term itself is offensive. We disagree.<br><br>First of all, many Mary-Sues themselves are NOT empowered characters, and ascribe to the basest tenets of the patriarchy (heterosexual marriage is the true way to happiness, women are homemakers, men win the bread, etc.) (Artell). How many Mary-Sues join the Fellowship only to have Aragorn or Boromir save them in a dramatic manner from a danger that a so-called empowered female could have got out of herself? How many Mary-Sues fall in love with a wholly unsuitable, even dangerous man (e.g. Sweeney Todd, Severus Snape, the Phantom of the Opera), and expect the power of Twu Wuv to turn him into the perfect mate and father so she can have a perfect life? How many Mary-Sue stories depend on a man to complete the fantasy? How is that empowering to women?<br><br>Second, the PPC believes that there is no excuse for bad writing, and the fact of the matter is that people who write Mary-Sues are likely to be poor writers. However, there IS such a thing as a well-written Mary-Sue, as shocking as that may seem. We are aware of this. You will never see us sporking a well-written, well-constructed Mary-Sue. Why? Because, as is stated elsewhere, the PPC rarely goes after only moderately bad fics, and we will <i>never</i> go after a good one. Even if it contains a Mary-Sue.<br><br>The fact that we primarily spork Sues has little to do with hating female characters and everything to do with hating bad writing. It&#39;s like drawing a correlation between ice cream sales and murders: the number of ice cream sales in a month appears to strongly correlate to the number of murders in a month; however, ice cream sales clearly do not cause murders. Both ice cream sales and murders strongly correlate to the temperature of the weather: murders are more likely to occur in warm weather, and so are ice cream sales. Similarly, Mary-Sues alone do not warrant sporking. Even though many sporkings happen to Mary-Sues, it is because of the third factor of bad writing, not the Sues themselves.<br><br>Third, a question: would you rather have us use a word other than Mary-Sue? Because we&#39;re perfectly happy to say &quot;poorly-written, unrealistic, shallow female character&quot; instead if it&#39;ll make everyone feel better.<br><br>Finally, we cannot ignore the fact that most fan fiction writers, sporkers and Suethors alike, are female. Although women can certainly be misogynist, it&#39;s a bit foolish to overlook this fact when complaining of sexist behavior. Of COURSE most of the works we spork are written by female writers, because that&#39;s who&#39;s doing most of the writing. If more guys were out there writing terrible stories, we&#39;d spork them, too. Have done, in fact. [Insert links to killed Gary-Stus here]. It&#39;s just that they appear with far less frequency than female Mary-Sues written by female writers.<br><br>Feel free to add to/refine that. It&#39;s heat-of-the-moment right now, probably not the most objective or clear. <sup>_<sup>;<br><br>~Neshomeh</sup></sup></p>

            <p>Very nice - I thouroughly approve. One thing, though:<br><br>You say &quot;there IS such a thing as a well-written Mary-Sue&quot;, but I think you should write that as &quot;a well-written character with all the typical characteristics of a Sue&quot; - clumsier, I know, but we call the Department of Bad Slash such because there is such a thing as good slash, but the DMS doesn&#39;t get called &quot;The Department of Bad Mary-Sues&quot; because we don&#39;t seem to believe there is such as thing as a Good Sue. I realise that&#39;s playing right into the hands of the essay-writer, but it&#39;d probably be the safer way to go.</p>

            <p>A lot of people can be unnecessarily cruel when criticizing a Mary-Sue fic.  I know, because I can be that at times.  We have to remember that we are not here to make fun of aspiring authors, since many of us were at that same point at one time or another.<br><br>That said, the author of this essay demonstrates the typical fanbrat tendency of not doing the research.  She has a temper tantrum at the beginning of the essay about taking words out of context, and then she goes right ahead and takes Jay and Acacia&#39;s words out of context.  The rant didn&#39;t even really fit in with the point she was trying to make.<br><br>And that comic strip?  Hah!  If she was trying to criticize the PPC, she&#39;s a hypocrite, because she&#39;s advocating the same sort of behavior she seems to detest in PPC agents.<br><br>Then she lists a few awesome female characters who, in different contexts, might be called Sues...and says that we hate them.  No we don&#39;t, because these characters were handled well.  They were special, yeah, but not so much more so than everyone else.  They didn&#39;t get away with breaking the laws of nature, physics, and their respective governments simply because of their specialness.  They had characters, and stuck to them.  They didn&#39;t try to &#39;fix&#39; a world that didn&#39;t require fixing.  When faced with a misogynistic society or situation, they didn&#39;t fix it by spewing mindless feminist rhetoric (like the author of this essay), they fixed it by bloody well pulling up their sleeves and *prooving* they could be as good as the boys.  Yeah, they saved the day, and they were badass about doing it, but the whole world did *not* revolve around their every little need.  *That&#39;s* what makes a strong feminine character...the ability to be strong just because she *is* strong.<br><br>Eowyn, anyone?<br><br>Plus, Mary Sues *are* the product of a misogynistic mindset.  You know how everyone criticizes rail-thin models because they threaten the self-image of preteen girls?  A Mary Sue is what happens when that negative self-image crosses over into fanfiction, when a girl is convinced that in order to be special, she has to be a goddess...instead of just being herself.  I&#39;m convinced that if more girls were satisfied with who and what they are, we would have less Mary-Sues to kill.<br><br>The essayist also forgets that, while the majority of fanfic writers *are* female, there are males as well...and they have to put up with the same type of crap that female authors do.  For example, the PPC criticizes Twilight, a badfic published by a female author, for obvious reasons.  However, it also criticizes the Inheritance Cycle, a badfic published by a male author, also for obvious reasons.  This isn&#39;t about us trying to repress female authors...it&#39;s about us giving male *and* female authors a reality check.  If the essayist had cared to actually read the missions, she would have seen that the PPC is an equal-opportunity sporking society.<br><br>Anyone who has read the sporkings of &quot;That Series&quot; knows that the PPC isn&#39;t misogynistic...the fics the PPC kills are.<br><br>And I shall descend from my soapbox now.</p>

            <p>There can be unnecessary cruelty. I think the goal should be to help people become better writers. Constructive criticism should always be a part of the &#39;treatment&#39;. It&#39;s the author&#39;s prerogative to ignore it.<br><br>The point about Mary Sues being misogynistic is an insightful one too, though I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s misogyny as much as it&#39;s poor confidence, or delusions of grandeur, or wish-fulfilment. Maybe more accurately they are a *product* of misogyny? The comparison to body self-image is apt.</p>

            <p>intellectually dishonest to hide behind the barrier of feminism and female empowerment to defend poor writing. It demeans female empowerment. Many Mary Sues are NOT empowered characters, and ascribe to the basest tenets of the patriarchy (heterosexual marriage is the true way to happiness, women are homemakers, men win the bread, etc.). <br><br>To paint PPC and critics of Sues as misogynistic is doubly dishonest, because PPCers are, in my impression, predominantly female*, which leads to my main point: *fan fiction is mainly written by women.* I just can&#39;t find any way around that fact. If a vast majority of fics are by women, then poor fics will also be written mostly by women, and thus you will have way more female Mary Sues.<br><br>It reminds me of the way heterosexual white men go about whining how modern society is actually oppressing *them*.<br><br>&#39;Bullying&#39; is also disingenuous. No one is making you publish your writing. If you don&#39;t like the criticism, you can ignore it, you can not accept it, you can circulate your stories in a closed community. But if you publish it on a place like fanfiction.net, you are implicitly consenting to scrutiny.<br><br>* Caveat: women CAN be misogynistic, obviously.</p>

            <p>Hello, PPCers!<br><br>As some of you may know, every once in a while a few of us meet up to get better acquainted, trade Sue-slaying methods, mock bad writing in the Real World, and other fun stuff. Boston is having a particularly lovely spring, despite the intermittent downpours...the trees and flowers are really loving it. So, if people are interested, I would like to host a Gathering for Spring/Early Summer 2010.<br><br>There&#39;s no firm date set (it&#39;s just an idea at this point) but I&#39;d like to find out how many of you think you&#39;d be able to meet up sometime in the next couple of months. As for the meeting place, I&#39;m thinking that the Boston Public Library would be my #1 choice. As always, I am open to suggestions.<br><br>Hope you can make it!<br><br>~Araeph </p>

            <p>If it helps, I <a href="http://i1015.photobucket.com/albums/af276/PPC_Gathering/PPC%20Meet-up/PPCsign.jpg">hosted a Gathering</a> before, with a grand total of zero casualties (apart from <a href="http://i1015.photobucket.com/albums/af276/PPC_Gathering/PPC%20Meet-up/Ourbeautifulsign.jpg">Mrs. Leggy</a>). Also, some things to keep in mind:<br><br>• The Boston public library, my proposed initial meeting place, has security guards stationed by the entrance. If anything suspicious happens, they will know. So, if you meet up with us and decide you&#39;re not comfortable going anywhere else with the group, you can just wander around the library with us and be perfectly safe, then bid us a fond adieu.<br><br>• At no point will we be going into...<br> - My house<br> - Any house<br> - A bar or club of any kind <br> - Any property that&#39;s off-limits to the general public<br><br>• You will not be getting into a car with a stranger, because I do not have a car. Nor do I like throwing money away on taxis. Short of a major natural disaster, we will be using public transportation.<br><br>• This is not a sleepover, an overnight visit, whathaveyou. The last Gathering began between 10:30 and 11:50 in the morning and was over at around 4:30 in the afternoon. We can stretch or shift those hours a bit, depending on everyone&#39;s preference, but I don&#39;t anticipate it lasting until sunset, let alone the wee hours of the morning.<br><br>• We will not be touring any unsafe areas of the city. Mostly, I see us walking near Copley, Park Street, the <a href="http://www.boston.com/travel/boston/neighborhoods/north_end/">North End</a>, and/or the waterfront. <br><br>Hope that helps!<br><br>~Araeph</p>

            <p>Don&#39;t worry, Vixenmage. I&#39;ve worked in Boston for two and a half years now, and I know my way around the touristy and non-touristy places. A tenative schedule would be the Boston Public Library, maybe Borders books or the botanical gardens, and then wherever we want to go, really. The <a href="http://www.mfa.org/tomb/">MFA</a> or the aquarium would be nice, if you wouldn&#39;t mind forking over $20, but we could also just walk along the <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bc/Boston_Long_Wharf_2.JPG">wharves</a>, visit the <a href="http://cache.boston.com/bonzai-fba/Third_Party_Photo/2008/08/26/1219786246_2296.jpg">best</a> <a href="http://www.vittoriacaffe.com/menu.html">dessert</a> <a href="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/175/459649025_fb20fe0e84.jpg">places</a> in the North End, get lost in the <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=boston+ma&amp;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&amp;sspn=38.281301,92.724609&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=Boston,+Suffolk,+Massachusetts&amp;t=h&amp;ll=42.358116,-71.056051&amp;spn=0.008737,0.022638&amp;z=16">down-towniest</a> part of Boston where the streets all crookedly converge, take the T to <a href="http://www.boston-discovery-guide.com/image-files/boston-beaches-4.jpg">Revere Beach</a> (if we make the Gathering later, the week of July 15, we get to see <a href="http://a2.vox.com/6a00c2251ceea68fdb00d414482fa2685e-500pi">these</a>), or Harvard Square in Cambridge...a $9 day pass on the metro will take you practically anywhere. <br><br>There&#39;s also just plain puttering around and talking.

            <p>In ongoing canons (such as TV shows that are still running) someone could start writing a fic during season three and make up a backstory for the characters that is later, say in season six, shown to contradict canon. It seems unfair to charge for contradicting canon (without claiming AU) in that case.<br><br>But what about when the canon fact (say, a previous marriage) was revealed in season three and the story (with the clashing backstory; say, a child conceived with someone not the wife at that time) was first posted three weeks later? It&#39;s possible the author wrote the story before the canon fact was revealed and decided not to rewrite to fit in the canon fact. In the case I&#39;m thinking of the author did not acknowledge canon fact took place and chose to ignore it. (Author is from the USA, as is the TV show, so I find it likely she saw the episode on its original air date).<br><br>I&#39;d like some opinions on this matter: because the author could have known the character was married at the time the child was conceived, should the child (who is a Sue without question) then be charged with making the character who is her father cheat on his wife? Character has been shown to be serial monogamous.</p>

            <p>In the last instance I agree with you. However, if the writer says nothing I think it&#39;s up to the PPCer whether or not to give them the benefit of the doubt, depending on the circumstances. Also, if the story was written or even in progress after a canon revelation and the writer acknowledges the error, that&#39;s all the more reason they should have fixed it, or at least done something to work around it. Especially if <i>not</i> fixing it specifically benefits a Sue and has no other reason behind it.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Blood Elves are a subrace of Elves in the Warcraft Universe.  They used to be known as the Highborn before their whole way of life was destroyed.  They began calling themselves Sin&#39;dorei (literally &quot;children of blood&quot;).  <br><br>They are a highly magical race.  They used to draw their power from the Sunwell, and the Well of Eternity before that.  Since both of the wells have been destroyed, the Blood Elves are going through a very uncomfortable period of magical withdrawal.<br><br>For more information: <a href="http://www.wowwiki.com/Blood_elf">Blood Elves</a></p>

            <p>Yes, I know that I don&#39;t have permission yet, and so shouldn&#39;t be writing anything about the PPC. However, my writing style changes drastically between stories, and <a href="http://www.fictionpress.com/s/2788074/1/A_Shadow_on_Padded_Feet">what I had planned to be my permission piece</a> is not written like anything I will write here, if I get permission. I think I can keep a semi-consistent tone throughout my missions, but I need to write something in Headquarters, at least, in order to find out what that tone is going to be. Can I write an introduction piece for one of my agents now, and use it for my permission request? Also, I have a few questions about various things, including some that might not come into play until later.<br><ol>
<li>Can I temporarily borrow Agent Ranger until I find someone else to partner my character with?<ul>

            <p>The only things you need Permission for are 1) missions, or 2) things that would noticeably alter the PPC. As long as you&#39;re not doing those things, you&#39;re free to write whatever you like. {= )<br><br>As for the questions:<br><br>1. I&#39;d personally prefer it if you adopted him permanently, but since Jay and Acacia did say he was free to use, I don&#39;t think there&#39;s anything stopping anyone who wants to borrow him (though it is polite to ask the Board first). If that is what you decide to do, just make sure you address what happened to Agent Robyn, who he got partnered with.<br><br>However, that said, I agree with the people who are confused that you don&#39;t want to make your own character. If you don&#39;t have a team ready yet, why not just wait until you do? Heck, I hung around for almost four years before Ilraen came along and I partnered him with Nume. {= P I&#39;m an extreme case, but still. There&#39;s no reason to rush into writing missions if you&#39;re not satisfied with your team.<br><br>2. DoSAT tends to appropriate canon technology and modify it for PPC use rather than make stuff up out of whole cloth. The CADs, portal generators, and disguise generators are a few exceptions. Also, as someone else said, what&#39;s wrong with a regular leash?<br><br>3. No one&#39;s ever really bothered about this before, as I recall. I am positive that HQ does not do any translation of its own accord, though. I am also positive that every agent is equipped with a Universal Translator as a matter of course, just like they&#39;re equipped with a flash patch, a CAD, and a remote activator; and it would have to translate written words as well as spoken. The agents couldn&#39;t do their job without it.<br><br>However, as others have pointed out, the Rule of Funny trumps just about everything. If you need the UT to stop working for a joke, then it will.<br><br>As for what it looks like... well, no one&#39;s ever bothered about it before. I figure it would have to be something very small, not easily noticed. Maybe it&#39;s even built into the flash patch. They&#39;ve already got a microchip and SEP field generator in there; no reason for the UT not to be part of the same device. ... Of course, in that case it wouldn&#39;t work if the agent wasn&#39;t wearing the flash patch.<br><br>Then again, there is more than one kind of Universal Translator in the multiverse. The most obvious is the <i>Star Trek</i> device by the same name. But then, Douglas Adams gave us the Babelfish; <i>Farscape</i> offers translator microbes; some species have the ability to learn languages very quickly and/or communicate on a different level entirely and don&#39;t need one at all; and then there&#39;re all the various types of magical translation spells and/or artifacts you could wish for. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if the PPC makes use of all the options available.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>With those requirements, then, this story should be fine without Permission--don&#39;t worry, I won&#39;t make a habit out of writing non-missions. I was going to have Ranger and Robyn in a teaching role, and partner my agent with a character he recruited alongside that pair, but I found that I was writing a new agent instead of Ranger. So, I have found a partner for my agent and no longer need to borrow anyone. Though it would have been nice to see them again...<br><br>I was thinking about making the leash out of several canonical technologies. The main reason I want it to be a <i>energy</i> leash is the ease of putting it on. You don&#39;t want to be around my agent when he&#39;s that angry. It also has the benefits of being able to be easily extended or retracted and a more advanced shock absorbing system so the holder is not pulled off of his or her feet--and it would also be much harder, if not impossible, to tangle. A dog leash wouldn&#39;t be too bad, and my agents are now going to use it before they get the other (I hope no one minds), but I have a scene in mind that practically requires the energy one.<br><br>I enjoy the flash patch idea, but am thinking maybe something like a miniature headset with the visual translator built into glasses or contact lenses doubling as neutralizer protection. I&#39;ll think about it.</p>

<li>I once created an agent for the purpose of appearing in one scene only. I guess to each their own, but why don&#39;t you want to create an agent for just a few missions?<br><br>2. As you&#39;ve probably guessed already, the guidelines are: new technology should be funny, and it should not make the agents too powerful.

            <p>If I were you, I&#39;d make up your own partner, but I may be a bit biased...I love having lots of characters.  (I have seven active agents right now.)  Having the pair be entirely your own, even if it&#39;s only for a few missions, gives you a lot more freedom.  And you can make up an Agent who&#39;s already been in the PPC, if you want.  Most of my Agents have been in the PPC a lot longer than I have...<br><br>New technology should be used sparingly.

            <p>Well, first of all, you can practice your writing style any way you like - we&#39;re not the Writing Police. So don&#39;t worry about what you do for practice as long as it&#39;s not posted anywhere prior to your getting Permission, and as long as you take under consideration whatever suggestions you are given when you do ask.<br><br><br>1. I really don&#39;t think you need to fret so much about this; there&#39;s nothing wrong with creating an entirely new character for just a handful of missions - the only downside to it is that those of us reading your missions could get confused and you have less time to develop them as characters. You can make up any team you like, and if it doesn&#39;t work, it doesn&#39;t work. I created Agent Iza as a partner for my Agent Sedri, but after four or five missions, it was clear that the two of them didn&#39;t have long-term funny dynamics, so I gave Iza away to Trojie and Pads, and will make up a new partner for Agent Sedri next time I write a mission. But if Trojie and Pads hadn&#39;t wanted Iza, I would have simply let her fall aside. There&#39;s no reason you can&#39;t do the same.<br><br>That said, if you&#39;re certain it&#39;s Agent Ranger you want, in a temporary basis... I suppose so. As he is a TOS character, it&#39;d be polite to get opinions from the Board as a whole first. <br><br><br>2. There are no <i>specific</i> guidelines, but generally we don&#39;t create new technology unless there is a need. For example, I co-wrote a mission with Trojie once in which she rightfully pointed out that murder leaves far too much blood on the floor - so we came up with the idea of a <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Capillary_Towel">Capillary Towel</a>, which could effectively clean up the mess. It&#39;s been used a few times since. <br><br>Concerning your energy leash... I&#39;d rather you didn&#39;t, particularly it sounds a bit too unusual and powerful, what with technology from multiple fandoms and all. What&#39;s the point of having it rather than, say, a normal lightsaber? Or a <a href="http://memory-alpha.org/en/wiki/Energy_whip">Ferengi energy whip</a>? Those are canonical, there&#39;s no need to explain them, and they work just as well. Also, take another look at <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Mission_Writing_Guide#Can_I_give_my_agent_a_special_race_.2F_talent_.2F_power_.2F_weapon.3F">the bit about special weapons</a> in the Mission Writing Guide; too much speshulness is a bad thing.<br><br><br>3. That&#39;s an interesting question - I&#39;m not sure. Since HQ is a Word World, then UTs technology would work within it just as anything else (like lightsabers) would; the Real World rules certainly wouldn&#39;t get in the way. I imagine that agents who don&#39;t speak the dominant language (or who are of a species that <i>can&#39;t</i>) would carry translators around as a matter of habit. I doubt that it would be the building itself that translates - that place likes to make us late by playing maze, remember? It&#39;d probably muddle up the translations just for fun.<br><br>Still - opinions, guys? Whatever we decide, we&#39;ll certainly have to add it to the FAQ:For Newbies...<br><br><br>Hope that helps, Goldenrod.</p>

            <p>I would kind of enjoy having a character that people might recognize, but then I would really like to team him with a former Mary Sueish bit/minor character--hopefully one that he and his first partner recruited. I don&#39;t need Agent Ranger specifically, but he currently seems to be the best character for the role. The blood elf seems cool, but I&#39;ll need to do some research; I don&#39;t know that canon.<br><br>I&#39;m sorry about the lack of description of the leash. I was actually intending it to be used for one of my agents when he gets a bit too violent and was not thinking about giving it any combat abilities. I suppose it could be used for other characters, but I agree that it would be getting close to super-powered.<br><br>I&#39;ll see about getting my agent a translator then. I&#39;m also hoping to get him into some English classes so he does not have to rely purely on technology. By the way, I assume the translators translate written words as well? If so, what do they look like? I was thinking about something that would be clipped over the ear, but I&#39;m not sure how that would help visual translation. Or is that artistic license and/or writer dependent? Also, I love the idea of the building messing with the technology! I&#39;ll see if I can work that in.</p>

            <p>I know of one or two characters that were/will be recruited but that haven&#39;t been used yet.  One of them is an unnamed Blood Elf Sniper Commander from the Warcraft Universe.  He was recruited at the end of <a href="http://gc-dms.livejournal.com/546.html">this mission.</a>  He has been in headquarters for a while and so may know what is going on.  You should probably ask <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/User:Farseer-Lolotea">Farseer Lolotea</a> before using him, though.<br><br>The other is an Orc Warrior from the Warcraft universe.

Since my agents rescue him, I have no problem with you using him.<br><br>As for question 3... the rule is, &quot;If two things are possible, but one of them is funnier, then that is the one that will probably happen in HQ.&quot;</p>

            <p>Regarding your first question, yes, it is possible to write an introductory piece for your agent/s as your Permission piece. I did it myself, and I know several other people have as well.<br><br>As for the others:<br><br>1. I don&#39;t recall seeing Ranger in anything since TOS, and I&#39;ve read a good number of spinoffs, so I think you&#39;re safe to borrow him. There may be offers of other Agents you can use, too, but I&#39;m pretty sure Ranger&#39;s a safe deal.<br><br>2. I think it would depend on what function you need the technology to perform. Why exactly do you need a retractable energy dog leash, for example? As a general rule, we tend not to allow things that would make things too easy or comfortable for the agents. Admittedly, technology&#39;s not my strong point; you might be better off taking that up with some of the oldbies, particularly Techno-Dann.<br><br>3. The universal translator issue is pretty much governed by the Rule of Funny. If there is an amusing reason for the translator not to work, then it won&#39;t work. Otherwise, communication is possible throughout HQ, as far as I&#39;m aware. As with the technology query, though, you&#39;d be better off getting a wider consensus rather than just going by one person&#39;s view of it.<br><br>Hope this was helpful.</p>

            <p>*poke*<br><br>I don&#39;t know what you&#39;ve already read, of course, but there are a few things you should definitely make time for. First, there is the <a href="http://www.misssandman.com/PPC/story.html">Original PPC Series</a> by Jay and Acacia--but you HAVE read that, I see. {= )<br><br>Second, we require that everyone read and abide by the <a href="http://twistedskein.webs.com/PPCHome/Constitution.htm">Board Constitution</a>, because it&#39;s nicer that way.<br><br>After that, there are several helpful documents on the Wiki designed to help acquaint newcomers with us and our habits and behaviors and general weirdness. Sedri&#39;s <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Guide_to_the_PPC">Guide to the PPC</a> is particularly informative, especially when combined with the <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/FAQ:_For_Newbies">FAQ for Newbies</a> and the <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Mission_Writing_Guide">Mission Writing Guide</a>. If you do want to write PPC missions, you should also see the article about how to get <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Permission">Official Permission</a>.<br><br>And that&#39;s probably quite enough to start with. {= ) Welcome!

            <p>Um, I really hate to point this out, but you said the mission was going to be in 2006 when I handed over my two. They weren&#39;t there in 2005.

            <p>I need to figure out a better timeline for mine as well.
