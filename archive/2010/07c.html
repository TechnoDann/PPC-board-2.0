            <p>This feels to me to be the work of a late-stage suethor... possibly around 17 or something. It&#39;s done with at least slight knowlege of canonish things (IE not some 12 year old who watched only the movies) but the author doesn&#39;t realize how Mary Sue her characters are.<br><br>Reminds me of my own work at 16... Most everything done for AND IT WOULD BE SO COOL IF, rather than something more carefully thought out. *shudder*</p>

            <p>I had similar thoughts as well. All things considered the writing&#39;s not bad, and 75 chapters is rarely a dedication kept to by younger writers. <br><br>It was Elrond&#39;s sparkly eyes and the apparent complete disregard of Celebrian (I can&#39;t say for certain because I could only bring myself to skim it through) that really froze me.</p>

            <p>Seconding doctorlit, first of all. I <i>like</i> &quot;Flight of the Navigator.&quot; If they could take the same story and present it with nice effects, that would be okay, but you know that isn&#39;t what they&#39;re planning. No. So it&#39;s going to stripped (of its charm), polished (a flaming urple), and then rammed down our throats with the rest of the tripe.<br><br>Second--and this is actually unrelated--I get the impression that ~jarredspekter has no soul. How does he get off deriding &quot;Avatar&quot; for having a cynical, bitter message and then turning around and claiming it has no story and no point? This does not compute. Especially not when he&#39;s doing this in comparison to &quot;Terminator&quot; (which actually has the SAME MESSAGE, if you ask me; at least in part).<br><br>Jerk.<br><br>~Neshomeh, who can&#39;t understand why the ideas of tolerance and responsibility for our world, in any packaging, are so offensive to some people.</p>

            <p>I love the old 2D movies, even the cheesy Disney ones. No matter what anyone says, the <i>original</i> Disney stuff was good, along with the rest of its ilk. (Brave Little Toaster, anyone?) <br><br>Kids&#39; stuff now is... almost creepy. I mean, yes, there&#39;s this, and it&#39;s teetering on the edge of the Uncanny Valley--but there&#39;s this one show called the Backyardigans. I think they&#39;re supposed to be farm animals? I can&#39;t tell if one&#39;s a bird or a fish. Or maybe it&#39;s a pig... No, I think it&#39;s a snail. Yes, it does look rather like a claymation blob given eyes.<br><br>It seems that people are forsaking quality and story for the sake of flashy 3D. Sometimes the 3D isn&#39;t even all that flashy--sometimes it&#39;s downright disturbing. I mean... Donkey Ollie. <i>DONKEY FREAKING OLLIE.</i> That <i>thing</i> gave my friend <i>nightmares</i>.... -gulps Bleeprin- Augh. Sorry. I think that thing scarred me permanently.<br><br>...I&#39;m ranting, aren&#39;t I. I&#39;ll stop now.</p>

            <p>I hate almost all of the children&#39;s television programming from the last decade. The characters are stupid looking, just plain stupid or both. They are disgusting to look at, never mind what they are doing.<br><br>We don&#39;t have live TV (mostly the cost, but this is an added bonus). We buy old cartoons for the kids on DVD. They love GI Joe, the original Transformers, Inspector Gadget, the original Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, He-Man, 90&#39;s Spider Man, X-Men, and Batman. They even like really old stuff like Popeye and Tom &amp; Jerry (which admittedly those two are just about as dumb as some of the stuff on now). <br><br>They&#39;re little friends who do have live TV will come to our house to watch these shows. Kids still like this old stuff. <br><br>I loved the 90&#39;s shows that had people drawn to look like people, and backgrounds drawn to look as realistic as possible. Most stuff now looks like a Kindergartner drew it.<br><br></p>

            <p>I liked what cartoons from the 2000&#39;s I saw (2003 Ninja Turtles, Spongebob, Brandy and Mr Whiskers), while I found that what 90&#39;s cartoons I watched as a kid weren&#39;t as good as I tought upon rewatching (with exceptions).

            <p>...Danny Phantom, Fairly Odd Parents (mostly the earlier seasons), Meet the Robinsons (despite its Fride Logic), Bolt, and Avatar: The Last Airbender(which <i>was</i> produced in the west) into that paragraph. But like I said, I don&#39;t want to start a debate, especially when I can see what you&#39;re coming from.<br><br>Also, I have another complaint about the upcoming movie. Why the mix of live-action and CGI? Just full CGI would do. Why not have the Human characters be 3-D too, as well as something resembling their original cartoonish selves? I liked the original Ranger Smith better than the actor posing as him. </p>

            <p>Danny Phantom and Avatar:The Last Airbender were both pretty good. I especially liked the way that Avatar looked. Both of those tend toward more realism, well Danny Phantom at least  has <i>more</i> realism than the shows I hate so much.<br><br>Sponge bob is fun and Kim Possible is not bad either. I&#39;m sure I was being too broad in my statements earlier. I don&#39;t hate <i>all</i> the new stuff.<br><br>Oh, and I love Stitch!

            <p>It still looks more real than that cartoon with the camp full of creatures that might be beans. I&#39;m not sure what the name of that one is, but it is gross and the animation seriously annoys me. That style of animation is something I hate beyond reason.</p>

            <p>I loved <i>Beauty and the Beast</i> and <i>Aladdin</i> and all them - I liked <i>Toy Story</i>, too, but that was about it for the CGI movies. Disney made a huge deal out of the fact that <i>The Princess and the Frog</i> is traditional 2D animation and it was a <i>great</i> movie. Regardless, the moviemakers are pouncing on 3D films that make me dizzy. What, may I ask, is wrong with 2D films and hand-drawn characters?<br><br>That said, I never watched Yogi Bear as a kid so I&#39;m not overly attached, but this remake still looks pretty bad. </p>

            <p>One of the big problems is that when something using a particular gimmick is successful people think it&#39;s the gimmick that&#39;s responsible for the success. that and it&#39;s easier to just use gimmick X than to actually put together a quality movie.

            <p>Awesome! I tried to record &quot;I Need An Agent&quot; once but my lack of backing track and timing meant it sounded awful. I sing soprano and would be happy to help you out if you wanted/backing tracks can be found. XD</p>

            <p>There are several links in <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Complete_List_of_PPC_Fiction#Song_.26_Poetry">this section</a> of the Complete List of PPC Fiction. I think the ones you&#39;re particularly interested are in <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/the_ppc/22645.html">this LJ post</a>, and I know you did at least one of the <a href="http://starshadowhall.tripod.com/ppc/songbook.html">Holiday Songbook</a> ones. The ones from last year are sadly not posted, but I expect I&#39;ll get to it around December, like usual.<br><br>You sound great in that recording (though rather a lot more like a soprano than a tenor O.o ). Any of the holiday ones you want to sing, I&#39;d love to host in the Songbook. I&#39;ve tried to do recordings of some of them, but I always sound like crap to myself upon playback. Plus it&#39;s kinda embarrassing, not knowing who might be able to hear me going on about Sue-slaying and such. {= P ... Although, I might be able to muster up the courage if you want to arrange some kind of duet. Because that would be awesome. I might even be able to talk Barid into singing bass/baritone.<br><br>~Neshomeh, some kinda mezzo-soprano.</p>

I won&#39;t start wearing makeup on a regular basis until I can get an entire skin-care regimen named after the Seven Deadlies. Because red liquid liner named Wrath would be awesome.

            <p>I was looking for those~!<br><br>I can sing tenor, but there isn&#39;t a recording of me singing tenor.

There was also a bunch of songs from musicals I&#39;ve always wanted to do. Like the one where Mary-Sues have stormed Hogwarts and it&#39;s sung to the tune of &#39;Kill the Beast&#39;. It was awesome. I can pull off Sue-ish singing pretty well, as awful as that must sound. XD<br><br>If we could find an awesome song for three, we should do it!

            <p>Is it wrong that the thing that strikes me as wrong about that is that I find it hard to believe that Rose Weasley might be blonde?<br>I mean, I don&#39;t know, is red hair or blonde hair more recessive? We know that this Rose&#39;s mother was a brunette, but perhaps she had a recessive blonde gene, and if blonde is dominant over red, then maybe Rose was blonde.<br>Then I start making punnet squares and searching my old biology notes for the finer points of genetics, and then I realise that I&#39;m probably putting more thought into this than the author did.<br><br>I am vaguely interested in the idea of jedi in Middle-Earth, though.</p>

            <p>Two traits involved: Brown-to-blond (the more brown, the darker the hair) and red/no red (no-red is dominant). (There are probably multiple genes involved, because you can get different shades of brown, from practically blond to deep black.)<br><br>A red-haired person (orangey red, not auburn) has to have a blond, red/red genotype, because red is a recessive gene and you can&#39;t have too strong of a &quot;brown hair&quot; trait before it looks auburn. They can pass on only blond and red to their kids. That means that if two red-headed people have kids, all the kids will be redheads.<br><br>Ron passes on blond and red/red. Hermione has brown hair, so she could pass on anything from blond to brown and either red/not-red or not-red/not-red.<br><br>So Ron and Hermione&#39;s child could have, depending on which genes Hermione is carrying, either red, auburn, blond, or brown hair.<br><br>The only hair color Rose Weasley couldn&#39;t have is deep black or very dark brown, because Ron and his red hair will only pass on &quot;light hair&quot; genes, which at the most end up as mid-brown if Hermione passes on all her dark-hair genes.<br><br>Oh, and this also means that anybody who writes a non-redheaded Weasley kid can be charged with forcing Molly Weasley to cheat on her husband, because that&#39;s the only way it could happen (barring adoption or transfiguration).</p>

            <p>I think I&#39;m some sort of admin. (JulyFlame definitely is one, since she created the wiki.) I&#39;ve had a very brief look at your site, and I do wonder if you could tell me how to fix the infoboxes so that, in instances where the category names are long and the line wraps (such as &quot;Home Continuum:&quot;), the data lines up with the colon. Basically, instead of looking like this:<br><blockquote>Home         Middle-earth<br>Continuum:</blockquote>It should look like this:<br><blockquote>Home<br>Continuum: Middle-earth</blockquote>And any other such tricks and tips. I&#39;m interested in knowing how these things work myself, not just borrowing from others. So far I&#39;ve taught myself how to do everything from formatting to making infoboxes to making disambig tags from scratch, and I don&#39;t plan to stop doing things that way. {= )<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>OK, let&#39;s see.<br><br>I liked the idea of a new Sue species that pushes canon to the background rather than outright Sueing it. There&#39;s definitely good fanfiction to be had in the idea of &quot;borrowing the world, and not the characters&quot; (like the way you might write a story about an OC who lived in Minas Tirith during the Battle of Pelennor Fields, and give the Fellowship cameos)... but this wasn&#39;t it. This was, as far as I can tell from your mission, not just borrowing the world but deliberately making the main characters unimportant in their own canon--rather an insidious sort of attack, I think.<br><br>Anyhow, you&#39;re right about it needing a beta; you&#39;ve got typos in there still. I think a description of the RC and other locations would be good, too, so we know what the setting looks like.<br><br>Yay for first missions! I swear I&#39;m going to write my first one sooner or later, really I am...</p>

            <p>Since you already have several presents, and are going to get so many more you can&#39;t count them all, my present is a &#39;fairy box&#39; from Ella Enchanted. Hey, don&#39;t give me that look- the book was pretty good even if the movie wasn&#39;t. And the box will expand to almost the size of a hot tub, or shrink to the size of a charm on a bracelet without damaging the contents. Good for keeping stuff.<br><br>Anyways, welcome! What fandom are you, again?</p>

            <p>Thank you, and likewise! :)<br><br>I&#39;m not giving you any sort of look - I read Ella Enchanted when I was younger and, while I must admit I couldn&#39;t get into it and mostly enjoyed the film for the musical numbers rather than anything else, I can see how people would like it. Thank you for the box! Indeed, it does look like it will be useful.<br><br>I&#39;m in the Tolkien fandom - both LotR and Silmarillion. I once took a tentative step into the Harry Potter fandom, but found it frankly scary and have retreated into Middle-earth.<br>How about you?</p>

            <p>I enjoyed The Three Musketeers, though I&#39;ve not read anything else by Dumas. And Pratchett is also a favourite of mine, though I&#39;ve never visited the fandom. There are several others there I&#39;ve read, though not for years. My pleasure-reading has suffered in recent years.<br><br>Beren+Luthien vs. Bella+Edward? No contest whatsoever. The Lay of Lethian is my favourite love story in all the literature I&#39;ve ever read and I despise Twilight and all that it stands for, though, so I&#39;m possibly a little biased.<br><br>Nice to meet you too! :)</p>

            <p>Oh, thanks! Mine wanders a lot, so that&#39;ll be useful.<br><br>Heh. Well, there&#39;s not much of a story. I was looking for an elvish name, partly for my own use as a webname, and partly for an OC (Legolas&#39; incredibly badass twin sister, who was engaged to Elrohir. Fortunately, I came to my senses before writing anything about her, or I&#39;d never be able to show my face in public wearing her name). Green is my favourite colour, and after spending some quality time with the appendix to the Silmarillion I found a second element - spirit. &#39;Green Spirit&#39; seemed to have the sort of wood-elf feel that I was going for, hence, Galenfea.<br>I must admit, I&#39;ve never been asked about it before; I&#39;m rather flattered. :)</p>

            <p>Ah well it comes from when I started posting on a Jak &amp; Daxter message board. The trouble was every canon related name I could think of was already taken or terrible. But I also had a short story in the Legacy of Kain fandom to post and needed a name for that. I just took the name of a major character from both, Jak and Raziel and slammed them into each other. </p>

            <p>And I don&#39;t mean to stir up controversy if it has. It&#39;s just something that came to me yesterday when I was reading &quot;<a href="http://www.misssandman.com/PPC/Chapter1.htm">Ashes to Glory</a>&quot;. As I read it, &quot;Ashes to Glory&quot; isn&#39;t strictly a criticism of the PPC, but rather of the PPC&#39;s generally violent methods.<br><br>So, question: do all &#39;Sues have to be killed? I mean this question in two ways: first, is there something I didn&#39;t notice which means that &#39;Sues have to be killed in order for canon to revert? Second, more philosophically, are there no &#39;Sues who could be humanely disposed of in other ways? Have &#39;Sues ever been recruited? I know there are bit character Agents, but are there ex-&#39;Sue Agents I haven&#39;t noticed?<br><br>I&#39;m thinking particularly in the context of &quot;Ashes to Glory&quot; — couldn&#39;t &quot;Asherazel Morningstar&quot;, the uncanonical second daughter of Elrond who is apparently quite pretty but seems to be utterly useless otherwise and frankly quite stupid, just be transposed somewhere to, like, a holodeck somewhere that would have lots of holographic CAFs and a boundary around it to suppress the Aura of Smooth (if such a boundary exists — and if it doesn&#39;t, we should probably put DoSAT to work inventing it)?<br><br>Not that I sympathize with &#39;Sues extensively, but it does seem to me that at least a few of the ones who aren&#39;t warping canon as extensively really have no idea that they&#39;re doing anything wrong — wouldn&#39;t it be more humane to just put them somewhere out of the way where they can&#39;t hurt anyone, themselves included?<br><br>There are probably some &#39;Sues who <i>are</i> warping canon extensively that don&#39;t know they&#39;re doing anything wrong, but somehow I can&#39;t find it in my heart to sympathize with, for example, Tenth (or Eleventh) Walkers.<br><br>Again, I&#39;m pretty sure this must have come up before, but I thought I&#39;d ask and see what people thought. If this has already been talked to death, I apologize.</p>

            <p>I was just looking at Architeuthis&#39; first mission, and I noticed something that jumped out at me (not literally. This is the PPC, after all--you never know).<br><br>&quot;...concerns of the PPC include Transdimensional Hopping (wherein the fanfic writer <i>sends herself and/or other people into another dimension</i>...&quot;<br><br>I&#39;ve never seen any missions regarding this, so it confuses me. Would this mean that the author herself is in the canon, rather than a Suvian stand-in as in the case of OC-fics? In that case, would the Agents have to return the (neuralyzed) author to World One without killing her? I don&#39;t know what our policy is about World One inhabitants invading and mucking with canon, but it seems to me that the Flowers would frown upon the killing of real people as opposed to parasitic mockeries.</p>

            <p>But there are PPC missions dealing with transdimensional hopping. Well, there should be more than one, as I believe getting pulled into TV during thunderstorm is a rather popular trope.<br><br>The one mission I know of that deals with this: <a href="http://members.home.nl/indemaat/mac02.html">Kelly meets MacGyver</a>. <br><br>I&#39;ve seen another fic that deals with transdimensional hopping, i.e. ending up in ones favourite tv show, but that was actually goodfic.</p>

            <p>In my opinion, self-insertions are killable Mary Sues, while &quot;Transdimensional hopping&quot; requires the character to be aware that the world that surrounds it is not real (Which doesn&#39;t happen frequently), and they shouldn&#39;t be killed, because they belong somewhere else.<br>However, I seriously doubt that the character represents the author faithfully, so I guess a neuralization would be necessary.</p>

            <p>Depends on the fic. I&#39;ve not seen one like this yet, but basically, you have to ask--is the character an idealized Mary Sue, or is she more of a silly fangirl having fun with the continuum?<br><br>So, if you have a &quot;girl drops into middle earth&quot; fic where the OC joins the fellowship, you&#39;re looking at a pretty typical Sue doing transdimensional hopping. These get sent to DMS and an assassination mission.<br><br>On the other hand, you have a self-insert doing transdimensional hopping, using the continuum as her playground. These kinds of stories are generally very silly and filled with references to how Hott the fangirl&#39;s LO is; the plot is likely to be replaced by things like introducing Legolas to the wonders of pizza or teaching Frodo how to play Tetris. There&#39;s a great deal of cultural contamination; but the OC is an avatar of the Author. These are generally little more than an author having some non-serious badly-written fun, in which case you neuralyze, put her back in her own world, and make heavy use of your Despatch kit. Oh, and send that fangirl to an OFU, ASAP.<br><br>An attempt at a serious story that results in a self-insert is usually a Mary Sue. Bad parody and bad humor are much more likely to be simple transdimensional hopping.<br><br>Check the missions from Despatch. They usually deal with transdimensional snatching, but hopping (i.e., an author avatar jumping to the canon world) is very similar.<br><br>In Real World terms, these are treated differently because you don&#39;t want to imply that you&#39;d actually kill the author. When the author writes a self-insert that&#39;s meant to be them, rather than an idealized Sue version of them, you don&#39;t want to go and talk about putting arrows through their eyes. It&#39;s not polite.</p>

            <p>As to be someday published, the fandom multiverse version of Aster Corbett is actually a self-insertion... of myself. I used to self-insert a lot (and I still do sometimes, but less annoyingly, rarely publicly, and for the rule of funny ONLY) but none of the stories were EVER finished, and Aster&#39;s character never even really gone into Mary Sue territory beyond the ability to pull limited mundane objects out of seeming-hammerspace because I never mentioned her having a bag.<br><br>She eventually fights her way back to her story&#39;s origin point (her house) only to find it&#39;s just a cheap copy and no one is, nor has ever been, nor ever will be, home. Understandably, she hates the &#39;real person&#39; who wrote her (and forgot to write her!) and runs around killing Self Inserts and Mary Sues hating that she was almost one of those-- in all the wrong ways, of course, until she&#39;s picked up by an Intelligence agent or something.<br><br>OF COURSE NONE OF THIS IS EVER MENTIONED IN-DEPTH IN THE ACTUAL STORY I AM WRITING, AS THE NARRATIVE IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN MY OC&#39;S BACKSTORY.

            <p>Less crazy circumstance surrounds Aster. She has no prior involvement with the PPC, and isn&#39;t hostile to PPC agents. Though she does resist joining or being picked up by the PPC (for now) she is friends with an intelligence agent, who finds her an all right friend but very trying.<br><br>Aster is kind of juvanile-- she was first written when I was 14, and consecutively re-written many times since then but none of her stories have ever actually reached completion. This makes her kind of an annoying Rebel Without a Cause with her own vendettas against Mary Sues and thinks that rules and stuff only will get in her way.<br><br>While the Mystery Assassin comes out of nowhere, you can see Aster coming from a mile away. Usually she stays out of high-profile stories, though-- so she doesn&#39;t make much contact. Which is why she was first found by an intelligence agent snooping for targets. <br><br>The Mystery Assassin is a threat. Aster is just a very touchy hysteric.<br><br>AND NONE OF THIS REALLY IS PLAYED UP IN WHAT I AM WRITING BECAUSE ASTER AND HER WOES ARE NOT THE POINT OF IT. AHAHAH WOW.

            <p>I know a lot of the time, when people write angsty/rebellious teenage characters, they go over the top and do it wrong. But that&#39;s not because the character&#39;s angsty... it&#39;s because the story&#39;s written as though said character&#39;s angst was REALLY the end of the world, instead of normal teenage woes that suck right now, but aren&#39;t such a huge deal in the grand scheme of things.<br><br>I think if you made sure to actually write Aster as the somewhat immature character you describe her as, there&#39;s not going to be an issue with the rebel-without-a-cause thing. Lots of teenagers are like that. You just have to make sure you don&#39;t demand the reader think she is always right and justified in her rebellion.<br><br>A lot of PPC agents are a lot more mature than their ages would suggest. We&#39;ve got fourteen-year-olds going on deadly missions that could easily kill them or drive them nuts; and they handle it pretty well, on the whole--very much like mature adults who are coping in relatively non-damaging ways with something that&#39;d make anybody go at least a little insane. (Justified somewhat because PPC agents are more mature to begin with--literature nerds often are--and because they may&#39;ve spent ten years at the physical age of fourteen.) It&#39;d be interesting to see an agent who actually is immature.<br><br>But YMMV. You could just as easily grow her up a bit instead. :)</p>

            <p>I&#39;m glad someone thinks this might be a cool idea. One of the things that bothers me about Self-insert stories (including mine!) is that the insert always just goes along with the plot of the canon, changing it or not, but ALWAYS following it. No enormous freak-out like you&#39;d expect from a normal person. They&#39;re just too geeked-up to act like someone REALLY torn away from their home, their friends, their dog, the college money that&#39;s been all for nothing, and their entire future on Earth. Self Inserts really DO have a lot to angst about-- but never what they DO angst about!<br><br>Sure, they always wibble on and on about getting home and stuff, but the new world always proves to subdue that with its Awesome Factor until the insert is just another character, and sometimes, even a Suvian if things get bad. Never have I ever seen a transdimensional displacement fic where the character breaks off and goes on their own, and does REALLY all they can to get home, rather than &#39;oh, if I follow the plot then eventually I&#39;ll get back or something maybe.&#39;<br><br>Aster started out a sincere character that&#39;s become a black humor parody of herself-- when she&#39;s not played horrifyingly straight. Most Self Inserts aren&#39;t. <br><br>If I ever narrate her *first* adventures, in which these concepts are important, this stuff will come up. But in the story I&#39;m doing, she&#39;s past the worst of the immaturity but still kind of a fanatical idiot who hates herself and believes that by walking into a story set in supposed-12th century Jerusalem with a sawed-off-shotgun stuffed up her pants and shooting every Suvian in sight is the correct course of action. Which it&#39;s not. <br><br>And I don&#39;t have time to mention any of this in what is essensially an EXTREMELY long mega-mission, in the ABSOLUTE WORST case scenario of complete and total technology failure. As much as I like my original character/fictional clone of me, the story comes first.</p>

            <p>No, not all Sues are killed. Yes, there are ex-Sue agents.<br><br>To elaborate, the first thing to realize is that not every Suefic is the target of a mission. We don&#39;t go after the mediocre ones; only the ones that really look to be damaging things, either not knowing or, more often, not caring that they&#39;re doing anything wrong. So, the moderately-well-written yet uninteresting Sues go free. To put it another way, any badfic, Sue or otherwise, has to be bad enough to make an entertaining mission. If she&#39;s got decent SPaG and has a semi-plausible reason for getting into Legolas&#39; pants, there&#39;s no point in PPCing her, because there wouldn&#39;t be much for the agents to snark about and, moreover, nothing much to put on the charge list. This is why we have charge lists, in fact. A kill has to be justified by canon-warping.<br><br>Second, there have been occasions of one of two things happening on a mission. One, in one of Architeuthis&#39; Intelligence reports, the Sue under observation actually began to naturalize as the story went on. In other words, she became less of a Sue on her own, and didn&#39;t require intervention. (I&#39;d like to see this happen more, if anyone can find stories like that.) Two, as mentioned, sometimes a borderline Sue is recruited. This doesn&#39;t usually happen in &quot;active&quot; missions, though--usually it&#39;s a backstory, and the Sue in question is one that a PPCer wrote themselves in their younger years. I&#39;m sure people can give you plenty of examples, but the one coming to my mind right now is Agent Diocletian.<br><br>I think the ACMSES disposes of their (invented for the purpose) Sues by dropping them into confinement somewhere. The problem I see with that, though, is how can you possibly contain them all in any kind of humane way? In any case, most of us don&#39;t see Sues as humans, or elves, or whatever they&#39;re claiming to be. Most often they&#39;re seen as a disease--and yes, it is stated that the Sue needs to be killed for the canon to heal, just like a virus. That&#39;s why everything snaps back into place after the kill in TOS.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Search the wiki under &quot;reformed Sues&quot;. There are several Mary Sues working for the PPC, all of which had to gain a personality and lose a lot of their speshulness before they could be recruited.<br><br>And no, Sues aren&#39;t people--they aren&#39;t written well enough to be people in any sense of the word. In some cases, they don&#39;t even have enough of a survival instinct to resist assassination, and even a cockroach can do that. (DMSE&amp;R have also looked through the Sue genome, which is extremely short--much less complex than any known living organism&#39;s genome--and consists mostly of urple prose and imperatives to destroy canon.)<br><br>When they recruit a Sue, the PPC isn&#39;t so much rescuing a person as they are rescuing something that could have been a person if it had been written properly. That&#39;s where we come in. Recruited badfic characters, whether they&#39;re near-completely undescribed bits or just horribly-written Sues, need a good writer to become &quot;real&quot;. They have to have a purpose, a personality, direction.<br><br>It&#39;s like the difference between a tumor and a living being. Sure, the tumor&#39;s alive; but let it grow any further, and it&#39;ll start causing a huge amount of damage. (Some Sues, including Canon Sues and many of the weaker ones we don&#39;t go after, are like benign tumors... they don&#39;t spread, and can be left alone with a watch-and-see approach.)<br><br>Could we recruit every Sue we meet? Yes. But it would be very dangerous. Have even one relapse, and she&#39;ll exert influence on her partner; before you know it we&#39;ll have two Sues, then four, then eight... Keep the numbers of recruited Sues low, and any relapses can be caught and dealt with before they start spreading.<br><br>I think maybe a lot of the reticence about assassinations isn&#39;t because Sues &quot;could be people&quot;; it&#39;s simply because they look like people. Most PPC agents are human or human-like in their thinking, and that means visual and auditory input channels are huge. Sues mimic actual people very well, at first glance. If they didn&#39;t look like human beings (or whatever species they say they&#39;re from), I seriously doubt anybody would have qualms about it.<br><br>So ask yourself: If that Sue were a computer program or a blob of protoplasm instead of an urple-haired teenage girl, would I still be worried about assassination? Most Sues never even reach the sophistication of the average chatbot or paramecium...</p>

            <p>Say, here&#39;s a question for you.

HHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH. From what I can tell, of the &quot;plot,&quot; it&#39;s about Harry Potter, a lone warrior armed with only a Groinsaw and his guitar ...slayer, scouring the universe to steal food for himself and Dumbledore.<br><br>Select passages:<br><br>&quot;Dobby relished his groinsaw&#39;s roar as he withdrew the flesh-choked blade from the astronaut&#39;s ruined skull.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Harry swung the guitar through Dobby&#39;s chicken neck. He took the head of his fallen dwarfslave and tore open his stomach, stuffing the head inside. Harry vomited steam and summoned a great meteor from space to smash into Hogwarts and kill everyone there, for no reason at all.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Harry, you must rock the ... out.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Harry channeled his rage through ...slayer. The angel blood boiled as he summoned the great meteor, swathed with the blood of the tiny ...lings at Hogwarts, leapt onto it, and flew into space. He encased the entire meteor in a wreath of holy ...fire and flew through Mercury, killing the ... out of it. Then he sent Mercury&#39;s carcass into Venus, killing the ... out of it and making every vagina in the galaxy explode, and inside every vagina a booby sang of mortal life&#39;s fleeting precipice.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Harry slammed his book shut. It wasn&#39;t really a book, because the pages were made of lasers and the words were made of headless women making godless love to dragons made out of motorcycles, but it was still reading&quot;<br><br>&quot;I am Rape Radbury. I write critically acclaimed fiction that always turns into fact. That&#39;s why I have more money than anyone.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Harry squinted so he could see the subatomic strings of the ropes. He began tossing antimatter at them with his mind as a group of children entered the rape ape&#39;s hiding place. They were well-groomed and impeccably attired, and there were 5.8 of them, just enough to represent an array of genders and races that would leave no one unhappy, save for the Eskimos.&quot;<br><br>&quot;He thought about sandwiches.&quot;</p>

            <p>Gyeh?! Gurgle--choke--BGAAAAAH!<br><br>My brain just broke.<br><br>The best way to describe this fic is &quot;Michelangelo got high on cocaine and shrooms--simultaneously--then timetraveled into the future, still stoned out of his mind, where some fool showed him Star Wars and Harry Potter and got him even /more/ high on synthetic chemicals unavailable in his own time. Eye of Argon may or may not have been involved. The resulting combination caused his head to explode, and the disembodied brain matter coagulated into a consciousness that then possessed the Internet. The Internet being the Internet, the consciousness lost what coherence it had left and wrote the fanfiction.&quot;<br><br>...Wow. That almost sounded like something that would have been in the fic itself, minus cosmic Lovecraftian forces that bleed lasers and Tyrannosaur-bear hybrids on hovercrafts. With chainsaws for eyes.<br><br>Is it disturbing that I can even come up with this concept?</p>

            <p>1) This has changed, but at one point the standard was linking to fic or some other story you&#39;ve written that wasn&#39;t PPC instead of specially writing a piece for the PPC.<br><br>2) Yeah! They can! And there are plenty of former bit-character Agents out there. One example is Ilraen. He&#39;s an Andalite agent in DIC, one of Neshomeh&#39;s. He was a bit in the fic he was rescued from before he came to the PPC. <br><br>3) Again, there&#39;s a general standard where one of the agents in a pair is the author stand-in.

            <p>The idea behind posting agent bios is that you have some idea what you are going to write, and that we have some idea that you know what makes a character not a Sue.<br><br>We don&#39;t need to know every single detail about your agents. At least not through a bio. Like with real people, characters&#39; perspective on life can change due to the things that happen to them. There is no need to post a new bio if there is a change in a character&#39;s circumstances, like your knife thowing agent decides to become a gun slinger because they kept poking themselves in the leg.<br><br>That is interesting information for a mission/interlude of course, and should most definitely go into the agent&#39;s bio on the wiki.

            <p>I&#39;m having trouble with my Valdemaran agent&#39;s bondbird. Would the bondbird be allowed on missions, or not on the grounds of it being a CAF?

            <p>They do have a psychic link with their bondmate, although they can separate. &quot;Can&quot; being the operative word; generally, bondbirds stay with their bondmate unless it&#39;s absolutely required for them to be elsewhere. In the Valdemar canon, they&#39;re used for scouting and hunting, as well as being combat allies (the average bondbird is about half again to three times as large as its natural counterpart).<br><br>If you know Soul Eater, a comparison would be a meister and a weapon while they&#39;re synchronizing--except that the weapon is about as intelligent as a five-year-old. (CAF issues. I prefer to raise the bar on the intelligence level so they can be actual characters.)</p>

            <p>An agent I&#39;m still developing is a Twilightverse vampire whose main source of food is Sues. In Twilight canon, the color of a vampire&#39;s eyes varies depending on whether they&#39;ve drank and what they&#39;ve drank. Vampires who haven&#39;t drunk in a while have black eyes, vampires who recently drank human blood have red eyes, and those who recently drank animal blood have golden eyes. I decided that whenever this vampire agent drinks Sue blood, his eyes turn purple.</p>

            <p>Since the entire cast of Twilight is composed of Suvians and/or bits, this therefore applies to everyone in the Twiverse as well, including off-screen characters.

            <p>Ironically, just after Trojie&#39;s post about how we&#39;re more than a Sue slaying society, I come bearing a link! It is a link with some startling similarities to the PPC. The major differences are: they only kill Sues, and they bring realistic animal companions along to fight the Cute Animal friends we all know and <s>loathe</s> love. (&quot;There was nothing quite like being gored form behind by a sparkly pink unicorn, and Alex had the scars to prove it.&quot;)<br><br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5377912/1/The_Death_of_Mary_Sue_3_Pirates_of_the_Caribbean">Link.</a><br><br><b>Quotes:</b><br><br>- &quot;Alice worked for an organization called the Sue Slayers United. They trained people to hunt and kill Mary Sues from different fandom&#39;s. The SSU was technically in its own &#39;world&#39; not in any specific canon, which meant there was no limit to what you would see around her. People who have been working here long enough no longer gave a second glance at the walking trees or screams that can from the lower parts of the building any more.&quot;<br><br>- &quot;She had dark bushy hair and a square jaw, and as Alex had discovered, a strong coffee addiction. She was dressed more casually than Alex is a purple buttoned-up shirt with the sleeves rolled back and plain black pants and sneakers.&quot;<br><br>- &quot;Raven steered Alice toward the armoury. It was its own wing at the SSU headquarters, full of many weapons. She found her way towards the Pirate section.<br>  &#39;Take your pick,&#39; Raven told her. &#39;Usually they&#39;re pretty good about weapons, as long as the weapon doesn&#39;t defy the laws of the universe you&#39;re allowed to have it.&#39;&quot;<br><br>- &quot;&#39;It&#39;s not too important seeing as how we&#39;re just supposed to pop in and out. We&#39;re not even supposed to talk to the Cannon characters if we can avoid it.&#39;&quot;<br><br>-&quot;&#39;It&#39;s a neuralizor,&#39; he told her after she stared at it dumbly for a few seconds.<br>  &#39;A what?&#39; she replied feeling like a dumbass.<br>  &#39;Those mind-wipe things from Men in Black?&#39;&quot;<br><br>-&quot;&#39;You are charged with the following!&#39; Alex announced cheerfully. &quot;Talking in chat speak, misspelling said chat speak (oh girl, that is just sad), comparing your hair to a muddy waterfall, contradicting yourself by using the world laughter and sorrow in the same breathe to describe your voice, dressing like a whore without getting ridiculed by canon characters…&#39;<br>  &#39;And for just being really f***ing annoying,&#39; Alice added as she walked up behind Alex.&quot;<br><br>-&quot;&#39;I only just remembered these; we haven&#39;t really needed them so far, have we? How do we read these things anyway? I was told it was easy but it&#39;s hard to make sense of them.&#39;<br>  &#39;Just point and click love, then it&#39;ll beep a few times and give us a reading on if it&#39;s a Sue, a canon character, or a healthy OC.&#39;&quot;<br>____<br><br>Sounds familiar, no?<br><br>I reviewed the fic, asking if the author knew about the PPC. She said she did, but she &quot;didn&#39;t steal the idea on purpose,&quot; and &quot;If there&#39;s anything too similar that you want me to change let me know.&quot; I can believe that she didn&#39;t steal the idea...after all, it seems to me that <i>anyone</i> spending a lot of time in fandom would want to kill Sues! There are a <i>lot</i> of other similarities, though, as you can see from the quotes above. She may very well have, er, lovingly borrowed from us. Still, I&#39;m inclined to leave the Sue Slayers United alone to do its noble work. What do you think?<br><br>~Araeph </p>

            <p>I&#39;m actually in the middle of editing the fics (I started when I was made aware of the similarities between the SSU and the PPC.) If there&#39;s anything people want to me to change I would appreciate the input. I’ve seen some good ideas here (like using visors that spot sues instead of the scanners) but I won’t use the ideas without permission from the people who created them. I just want to say that I did NOT steal the neutralizers from you guys, it was from Men in Black and I know it’s not original and its one of things I plan to change. I realise the story is weird and inconsistent, again, something I’m going to go back and change. If anyone gives me ideas I will happily credit them back to the people who made them. Despite the impression I may have given, I don’t like taking credit for stuff that’s not mine.<br><br>Also, I just want to say that I got a number of private messages from people who wanted to write their own sue slayer stories after reading about the SSU, so I think you can expect a bit of a boom of stories in this nature. I know it can all be traced back to you guys, the pioneers of sue slayers. Like how the Wolf Man was wonderful and original and is pretty much the parent movie of all werewolf movies since. I think you should be proud of yourselves for creating a new genre and wanted to let you know that I’m not the only one writing about sue slayers (apart from you guys) and I have read a fic about ANOTHER sue slaying organisation in the Maximum Ride section. The PPC and the SSU are not the only ones.<br><br>As for charging the sues with their crimes – this was something that was pointed out to me as a similarity. Fair enough. I would like to point out that this wasn’t standard procedure for the SSU, Alex and Alice did it once or twice because they thought it was funny. This is something that I can stop doing if you like. If people want something changed I would appreciate it if you tell me, really.<br></p>

            <p>re-posted with permission:<br><br>&quot;I did hear about the PPC before writing this, but I didn&#39;t intentionally stealthe idea. This fic started because I wanted to read a fanfiction where Mary sues died a horrible death but I couldn&#39;t find any, so I decided to write one<br>myself. Originally it was a one-shot, about a woman who murders a Mary-sue by dropping her into Mount Doom, but it became so popolur I decided to expand it and created Sue Slayers United.&quot;<br><br>Except for the typo, I pretty much believe her.</p>

            <p>She had heard about us, but couldn&#39;t find any stories in which the Sues die horrible deaths--on the scale of being dropped into Mount Doom, say?

            <p>You guys are being too harsh. There&#39;s only so many ways you can do the basic &quot;We fight and kill Mary Sues, etc&quot; dealie. <br><br>In other words, there&#39;s no need to reinvent the wheel, or get on other people&#39;s cases for &#39;similar&#39; ideas. There are dozens and dozens of badfic fighting societies out there and only so many possible variations, of course there&#39;s going to be similarities, especially if she did read PPC stuff. There are only so many ways you can kill a Sue, so many way you can make canon characters forget (pills similar to Torchwood&#39;s retcon, MiB neuralyzers, a careful bit of brain trauma, or just kill that fic&#39;s version), only so many ways you can watch the action, and so forth.<br><br>There&#39;s this &#39;Lemon Fighters&#39; fic out there that has agents, crappy budgeting, departments, and sarcasm and adversarial friendliness between two partners who alternate between picking up the slack for each other, and a fondness for wordplay. It&#39;s from early 2001. <br><br>Or how about those ACMSES people? They have a Canon Cannon just like we do. Except it does things different. And they have Plothole Generator, which hm. Seem to be Remote Activators under a different name, basically.<br><br>Or that group in the Artemis Fowl fandom, which is a bunch of teenaged girls fighting to protect canon.<br><br>Oh. My. Gosh.<br><br>I think CreativeSprite has made enough changes and has made what she&#39;s doing enough of her own thing that us getting on her case about it is just showing a bunch of people who are overly sensitive to other people using the same equipment in a different playground. <br><br>After all, we don&#39;t give every single PPC agent an animal counterpart to help with CAFs. Or envelopes saying what roles they&#39;re supposed to pretend to be and take up while they&#39;re in the fic. We don&#39;t do multiple chapter fics for missions. There&#39;s a continuing storyline, as compared to our favorite way of doing things with a formula. You&#39;re all being silly by focusing only on the similarities; when you bring the differences in it&#39;s a whole &#39;nother ballgame.<br><br>So it&#39;s that, or, y&#39;know, you lot are feeling <i>threatened</i> by it for some reason. Which is really silly, given her reply to Araeph. She&#39;s clearly aware of the similarities, but she wouldn&#39;t offer to change things if she didn&#39;t care; there&#39;s respect, which means she doesn&#39;t want to offend us. <br><br>And for you who are crying about her spelling and grammar? Go reread TOS. Then try and tell me that Jay and Acacia were perfect writers. With a straight face. Hell, go and tell me any of our stuff is perfect with wonderful spelling and grammar when it&#39;s put up without a beta going over it. You can manage that, right? Oh, wait, no.<br><br>Suck it up. We&#39;re not the only ones doing this, it&#39;s not just our idea, you&#39;re all getting whiny and defensive over something for no good reason. <br></p>

            <p>First off, I think you&#39;re saying the same thing I did but from a different angle, or to a different degree; yes, there are only so many ways to mock badfic, but there are several detailed elements too specific to the PPC to all appear in someone else&#39;s imagination by <i>coincidence</i>. I think we&#39;re picking details here - neuralysers, for instance. <br><br>But moreso, I agree with Neshomeh that if it IS a deliberate ripoff, then we have every right to be upset. If not, then - as you say - we have no right at all. Since we don&#39;t know for certain one way or another, everyone&#39;s sort of in limbo about it, and that can make us touchy. That&#39;s only human. I point out that we are saying these things <i>here</i>, on our board, not to her face. To do so without absolute proof would inexcusable.<br><br>So I&#39;ll lighten up, promise, but please calm down, will you? Maybe I&#39;m reading your tone wrong from between the lines (wouldn&#39;t be the first time), but it sounds like you&#39;re flying off the handle. Nothing&#39;s been decided.</p>

            <p>You have points. Granted. I&#39;m not really contesting them. However, I have issues.<br><br>Are you actually accusing us of having an investment in the PPC like it&#39;s a bad thing? I, for one, have been here for quite a long time, spent quite a lot of my time and energy in this community, and rather feel that it&#39;s worth something. If we are, in fact, being ripped off, I happen to think it&#39;s an insult to <i>everyone</i> who has spent their own time and energy as part of the PPC, and if that&#39;s the case then we have every right to be upset about it. Plagiarism, as you say, is a very serious matter.<br><br>I&#39;m not saying that is the case. You&#39;ll note that I have yet to say anything on the subject myself. I have not actually looked at the SSU yet. This is purely in the what-if scenario.<br><br>Moving on, on the subject of creativity: I don&#39;t know about everyone else, but I value originality. It&#39;s part of the problem I have with a lot of badfic, not to mention the reason I can&#39;t stand most fantasy (e.g. Eragon)--it&#39;s all derivative, and that&#39;s lazy. If you want to slay Sues but don&#39;t want to be us, then don&#39;t be us. Think of your own methods, your own gadgets. See WikiMaster&#39;s post--he lists just a few possibilities for doing it differently. Reinventing the wheel? No--the basic concept is still the same. At least giving it a different coat of paint would be nice, though.<br><br>At some point you mentioned different chapter structure and the animal companions. That&#39;s good, but more or less the same as the difference between a movie and a TV series. Different format does not equal different concept behind it. As for the animals, I know plenty of us have wished there was a precedent for taking minis and such on missions. It&#39;s not such a big step away from us when you consider that.<br><br>On the other hand, if you DO want to be us, there&#39;s a really easy way to do that: getting Permission. The reason we have Permission is precisely so that just anybody can&#39;t run off with Jay and Acacia&#39;s concept and do what they like with it. (Just <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5191600/1/PPC_Dawn_and_Dusk">look what we get</a> when that happens.) Again, I can&#39;t accuse the SSU of doing that without having read their work, but based on Araeph&#39;s post, the possibility exists. If that is the case, we have every right to ask them to either stop it or legitimize themselves. Jay and Acacia left the PPC to us, the PPC Boarders, on the understanding that we have the Permission handed down by them through the Permission-Givers. They didn&#39;t give the whole Internet a free pass to borrow from them with impunity, and doing so would be hugely disrespectful and deserve censure. See above: plagiarism is bad.<br><br>Now, the spelling and grammar concerns. Are you actually saying we shouldn&#39;t expect good SPaG from organizations that mock badfic--like us? You&#39;re saying we should just waive our standards now because back at the dawn of time Jay and Acacia didn&#39;t have a beta? I&#39;m sorry, but I can&#39;t agree with that. My standards for a finished, posted work apply to everyone, every time. That&#39;s why I&#39;ve volunteered my time to remove those errors from TOS. That&#39;s why I betaed for two OFUs. That&#39;s why I still occasionally beta and, in fact, want to be an editor. I know no one is perfect. Nobody expects perfect. However, we DO expect an effort these days, and I for one think that&#39;s a good thing.<br><br>So, in a nutshell, while I agree that we shouldn&#39;t be coming down on these people harshly, especially since they seem willing to get along, I also don&#39;t think there&#39;s any call to come down on us so harshly for voicing what may be legitimate concerns. I didn&#39;t see anyone starting a pogrom here--we were just talking about things that may be real issues. We weren&#39;t getting on their case. Nothing has been decided yet; nothing has been done yet. It was a discussion in which people shared their opinions, nothing more. You could have shared yours without insulting the rest of us for ours. Please think about that.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>No, I think it&#39;s a bad thing when a percieved investment in the PPC is being used  as an excuse to rip into people unnecessarily. Permission and involvement with the PPC community was, last I checked, supposed to be mainly for amusement, friendship, camadery, all of that, along with the writing of spin off and not an excuse to rip into anyone if they don&#39;t meet our perceived standards as a whole.  Calling anyone&#39;s work a knock off or declaring they <i>stole</i> it is downright insulting when it&#39;s not necessary.<br><br>Additionally, there&#39;s a difference between being aware and mentioning that someone has less-than-average SPaG and pointing out every error seen, somewhere where they&#39;re never going to see it. I also didn&#39;t say anything about the fact that we should waive or ignore or lessen our own percieved standards. But being persnicketity over SPaG to put someone down is quite frankly, pretentious. Acting like it is an automatic point against them is unfair. Suggesting they should get a beta is diplomatic.  Pointing it out to the person making the errors is always always better. </p>

            <p>No one is ripping into them. People have said &quot;I see this thing I don&#39;t like.&quot; That&#39;s not the same as &quot;Oh my god, this is terrible, they should be stricken from the Intarwebz,&quot; which I would consider ripping into them--especially if done to their face, which is not happening. People are entitled to their opinions, even negative ones.<br><br>No one has systematically gone through and criticized every SPaG error, either. They have said, again, &quot;I see these problems and I don&#39;t like them.&quot; Sedri specifically said a good beta would have helped. Having heard Barid&#39;s account of the quality of the first chapter, I&#39;m inclined to agree that they ought to have gone over it more carefully before posting. And, let&#39;s face it, we DO judge people based on SPaG. I don&#39;t see why it should be okay to charge a badfic for it and yet not okay to comment on the lack of it, in however much detail, in something that aspires to be better than badfic. I don&#39;t think that makes us pretentious, just consistent. And I&#39;m pretty sure everyone would agree to pointing out the problems to the author now that we&#39;ve discussed it.<br><br>Also, why do you describe the investment in the PPC and our standards as &quot;perceived&quot;? I don&#39;t understand that. To me, these things exist. We act on them every time we make a post or get Permission or ask for a beta.<br><br>Now, the concern I actually have is whether or not everyone has read the stories before commenting. If they have formed their opinions without all the facts, that&#39;s problematic. However, I can&#39;t know whether or not that&#39;s the case, because I can&#39;t read their minds. Therefore, for the sake of argument, I&#39;m assuming here that they did look at the stories and formed their opinions in good faith. (If that&#39;s not the case, that&#39;s a whole different can of worms.)<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I mean, I realize this isn&#39;t personal, or involving the entire Board. For my part, I&#39;m identifying with the people who replied to the initial post with distaste, because I kind of agree with them. I just hadn&#39;t gotten to the point of crystallizing my own thoughts into a post yet.<br><br>What I&#39;m mainly taking exception to is the aforementioned group being berated for things that haven&#39;t had any effect yet. If one of us had actually gone over there and accused them of stealing, to their face, with no evidence, yes, that would be wrong. Discussing it on our own forum before taking any action should be okay, though.<br><br>I also don&#39;t think it&#39;s fair to bring experience/action into the argument. The way to gain experience is to participate, and assuming that by action you mean &quot;stuff done with the PPC,&quot; making posts qualifies. You can&#39;t accuse someone of not having posted enough for their posts to count, whether you like what they&#39;ve said or not. It&#39;s just plain not fair. Just ask any of the habitual lurkers who pop up to say things sometimes. Again, everyone is entitled to their opinion.<br><br>And, incidentally, if you only had a problem with one or two people, you should have addressed them directly, not lambasted the whole thread. It might have prevented some confusion on my part, at least.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>From July&#39;s earlier post:<br><br><i>And for you who are crying about her spelling and grammar? Go reread TOS. Then try and tell me that Jay and Acacia were perfect writers. With a straight face.</i><br><br>Well, I can’t do that, but a comparison of the two stories will make the other posters’ meaning abundantly clear.<br><br><u>The first 407 words from TOS.</u><br><br>&quot;It&#39;s happened again.&quot; Jay leaned back from her console, indicating a flashing red light. &quot;Someone&#39;s mucking with the plot continuum.&quot; <br><br>Acacia sighed. &quot;Exactly what is so wrong with the canon that everyone wants to break it?&quot; she demanded rhetorically. &quot;Which world?&quot; <br><br>&quot;Lord of the Rings.&quot; Jay winced. &quot;The massacre of Tolkien continues. We have...a Mary Sue.&quot; <br><br>Acacia sighed. &quot;Usually the case. What species is she this time, and what&#39;s she done to break it?&quot; <br><br>&quot;Human. Magically transported from earth, <b>[Earth]</b> along with her band. Of COURSE she&#39;s joining the Fellowship...and you&#39;ll love this. She&#39;s stringing Boromir along while enjoying herself with Legolas.&quot; Jay looked sideways at her partner, hoping that this news wouldn&#39;t be too disturbing. <br><br>Acacia glared. &quot;Let me see this,&quot; she insisted, pushing Jay out of her seat without waiting for an answer. She started pressing buttons seemingly at random, glared at the screen as if hoping to burn the words off it by sheer force of stare, then stood up. &quot;Well, let&#39;s go <b>[insert comma]</b> then!&quot; <br><br>Jay tapped something on the console, causing an odd hum. A rather unimpressive flicker appeared in the air, taking on the appearance of an oblong doorway. &quot;Come on, Acy,&quot; she said, using her friend&#39;s dreaded nickname. &quot;Let&#39;s hunt some Sue.&quot;<br><br>Acacia muttered something that sounded like &quot;Don&#39;t CALL me that,&quot; but stepped through the doorway very quickly. Jay followed suit. <br><br>As Jay stepped through the portal, she felt her chosen guise fall into place around her...she made a rather impressive Uruk-hai, if she did say so herself. She took the formidable black bow from her shoulder, testing the string, and counted the arrows in her quiver. Then she took her Character Analysis Device and set it. &quot;I&#39;m all ready, Acacia--you?&quot; <br><br>Acacia looked around. It was always a bit disorienting, being in a world made of someone else&#39;s words, particularly when the canon was so stretched by the presence of <b>[insert comma]</b> not only a Mary Sue <b>[insert comma]</b> but--as a glance at her own Canon Analysis Device showed--canonical characters acting out of character. She took an arrow from her own quiver and first smelled, then gingerly tasted the point. The smell and bitter taste confirmed that it was in fact poisoned, and she put it back in the quiver, satisfied. &quot;All ready.&quot;<br><br>The pair had arrived just outside of Rivendell--its gentle glow lit the early morning. Acacia led the way, Jay following, as they crossed into the beautiful city. <br><br><u>The first 402 words from SSU.</u><br><br>A/N: This is the third installment of my series &quot;the <b>[capitalization error]</b> death <b>[capitalization error]</b> of Mary Sue.&quot; This installment was written together by myself and Apollo Night. <b>[“Apollo Night and I wrote this installment together.”]</b> This is our first joined project <b>[joint project]</b> and we hope you like it. I own Alex and Raven, <b>[omit comma, insert semicolon]</b> Apollo owns Alice and Dexter <b>[insert period]</b><br><br>Alice was excited, <b>[omit comma, insert period, adjust capitalization]</b> in fact <b>[insert comma]</b> she was down right <b>[downright]</b> livid. After she was made to take 3 <b>[numbers smaller than 10 should be written out]</b> weeks off work due to a work <b>[insert hyphen]</b> related incident <b>[insert comma]</b> Mac was allowing her to get back into the field of Sue hunting. Though she was no longer partners with the human train that was Sandy, she was still psyched to be doing something besides sitting in the therapist offices <b>[therapist’s office]</b> having him ask <b>[insert comma]</b>&quot;now <b>[insert comma, adjust capitalization]</b> how does that make you feel?&quot; four thousand times.<br><br>She was waiting patiently in a room to meet her new partners. Dexter the tiger was currently sleeping soundly at her feet. <b>[insert paragraph break]</b> Alice worked for an organization called the Sue Slayers United. They trained people to hunt and kill Mary Sues from different fandom&#39;s. <b>[omit apostrophe]</b> The SSU was technically in its own &quot;world&quot; <b>[insert comma]</b> not in any specific canon, which meant there was no limit to what you would see around her. People who have <b>[had]</b> been working here <b>[there]</b> long enough no longer gave a second glance at the walking trees or screams that can <b>[came]</b> from the lower parts of the building any more. <b>[anymore].</b><br><br>Just then <b>[insert comma]</b> Alice saw two women walk in, <b>[omit period, insert comma, adjust capitalization]</b> not missing a beat <b>[insert comma]</b> she jumped to her feet. Though it did little to improve her height, Alice stood at a whole 5&#39;2&quot; ( counting <b>[delete space after parenthesis]</b> the top of her spiky black hair) <b>[insert period, adjust capitalization]</b> she was so thin that she looked much like a nine year old <b>[nine-year-old]</b> boy. She looked very pixy <b>[insert hyphen]</b> like in general and didn&#39;t look like she would make much of a hunter to people who didn&#39;t know her that well. Though her skin was white, her eyes where <b>[were]</b> shaped like she had some Asian blood in her family somewhere.<br><br>____<br><br>Are lots of these errors minor? Yes. But there are still <i>lots</i> of errors, and more than a few major ones. In addition, and what I found more perturbing, is the fact that SSU made a <b>major</b> canon mistake further on. PotC takes place in the <i>1800s</i>? Really? <br><br><i>Hell, go and tell me any of our stuff is perfect with wonderful spelling and grammar when it&#39;s put up without a beta going over it. You can manage that, right? Oh, wait, no.</i> <br><br>Not having a beta is no excuse for <i>this many</i> errors.  First, I&#39;ve been without a beta since 2004. My writing does not look like this. Second, as mentioned before, there is more than one writer here, so they can check each other&#39;s work--and if <i>both of them combined</i> can&#39;t catch this many mistakes, yet they still mock other people&#39;s stories, well...<br><br>...I think that may be the point people are trying to make with the nitpicking. Maybe it came off the wrong way, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s about putting people down. It&#39;s about making sure the Sue mockers are holding themselves to a higher standard than the badfic they mock. Otherwise, what&#39;s the point? And yes, I think it <i>is</i> an automatic point against them...as long as they are going after Suefic for being poorly written.<br><br>I have to agree, however, that the SSU did not steal anything from us. I also think the series has a lot of potential. I simply don&#39;t think that we&#39;re being more unfair than usual on the subject of language. <br><br>*deposits her two cents*</p>

            <p>That was more than two cents... but I half-agree; Jay and Acacia do have typos, just not that many. And I bet if they were still active and noticed the typos, they&#39;d fix &#39;em.

            <p>I agree that betas are very important, doubly so when you are mocking bad writing in others--if only to avoid being mocked yourself. This writer seems open to concrit, and there are a lot of people here that are very, very good with spelling and grammar, maybe someone could offer assistance?<br><br>(Not me, my natural grammar abilities amount to different but equally bad mistakes--which is why I love everyone here that is willing and able to beta.)<br><br>I still think this story is similar enough to the PPC to remind people of the PPC, but it also has potential.

            <p>Between going &quot;Oh, yeah, they have some technical errors&quot; and then going and pointing them out unnecessarily. It&#39;s not going to be seen here, all it is is useless self congratulatory compliments, &quot;oh, yes, I can spell better than them and I know what to do with apostrophes, to boot&quot;. The best way to help people improve is to tell them what mistakes they made and why it is a mistake, not going and saying it&#39;s why they are immediately inferior (without stating it outright, of course).<br><br>We&#39;re all writers here, and not everyone&#39;s work comes out perfect, which is why I mentioned PPC TOS; Jay and Acacia still had technical errors on stories written between them. There was no beta for PPC TOS, but there seem to be a few people here heavily ragging on that fact for this anti-Mary Sue society. Betaing, while a good thing, and something that vastly improves the quality of the story when it is paid attention to, is not mandatory, and even then it can miss things.<br><br>There&#39;s also the fact of not being aware that there are grammatical errors and whatnot, or not catching them on a readthrough. I had issues with its/it&#39;s for ages until it finally clicked.<br><br>My problem with most of the people replying to this thread is they are being overcritical for little reason other than it seems to be hurting their feelings or perceived investment in the PPC, which is ridiculous since a few of the most vehement comments in here are from people who haven&#39;t written anything PPC related for some time, or don&#39;t even have permission yet.<br><br>Additionally, accusing people of stealing- of plagiarism- is a serious issue, and not something that should be thrown about lightly. <br><br>Because honestly, who the hell is going to mistake PPC for SSU, or vice versa? <s>Those letters are nowhere near each other on the keyboard.</s></p>

            <p>The very first quote has a grevious punctuation error; any decent beta would have caught the extra apostrophie. That alone makes me think that this &#39;organsation&#39; is both careless and hypocritical. Not maliciously so, but nonetheless. I don&#39;t like it.<br><br>Certainly, if someone without any knowledge of the PPC were to create a Sue-Slaying organisation, there are some things that would follow logcially - using in-canon weapons and avoiding interaction with canons -  but the use of neuralysers, the style of the charge lists, and the &quot;own &#39;world&#39;&quot; outside of any fandom are too specific to be natural coincidence. <br><br>My impression therefore is that this author read something from the PPC, loved it, but didn&#39;t like either our community restrictions or Permission-getting process and decided to strike out on their own. If she&#39;s being honest and encountered the PPC later, then I don&#39;t approve of her leaving her story up the way that it is - in her shoes, I would <i>instantly</i> take it down or heavily edit - but that&#39;s me and my determination not to offend anyone. <br><br>That said, I&#39;m not inclined to be nasty about it. If we did present her with a list of things &#39;too similar that we want her to change&#39; I imagine it would be both very long and poorly recieved, but I&#39;m not ready to write to the FFN admin and try to get her taken down. That&#39;s unnecessary and uncalled for. I would rather that she either did some thorough editing and adjusted &#39;her&#39; ideas so it&#39;s not such an obvious parallel, or apply for Permission and then adjust her work so it conforms to our standards - but, again, I don&#39;t see that happening.<br><br>In short, I&#39;m not happy, but I&#39;m not about to start a fight. In lieu of some very generous offers on her part, I&#39;m inclined to leave it alone. </p>

            <p>Before I knew the PPC, I liked to write little adventures going around resolving horrible fandom issues and battling Mary Sues. Except in my stuff Mary Sues took more of a &#39;hive-mind aspects of a single Eldrich Abomination&#39; feel to them. In fact, I still like to write them, and I&#39;ll be writing one with the help of a friend that actually includes PPC themes and stuff in it.<br><br>I think wanting to kill Sues is pretty commonplace...<br><br>Idk about stealing the idea, though... *shrug*</p>

            <p>There are an uncomfortable number of similarities. <br><br>Something else that worries me is the number of spelling errors and misused words. This is similar enough that anyone that has read a PPC story is going to think of the PPC when reading this, and she has some rather obvious problems with SPAG. Basically, if she is going to imitate us that closely, then her standards shouldn&#39;t reflect poorly on us. (Kind of pretentious sounding, I realize, but it&#39;s still my opinion.)</p>

            <p>steal it on purpose, but there are far too many similarities for my comfort... a building &quot;not in any canon&quot;, walking trees, a fully stocked armoury, rules about using canon-appropriate weaponry, no contact with the Canons unless necessary, neuralyzers, charges, ending on &quot;being annoying&quot;, devices that sound suspiciously like CADs... and that&#39;s just from the quotes.<br><br>Maybe they <i>can</i> be left alone for now, but if things take any sort of serious downhill turn/they&#39;re associated with us/both, I think we might really have to contact them and ask them to knock it off.

            <p>Some things are impossible to adapt well to the silver screen. Lord of the Rings is one of them.<br><br>There are very few cases where I do not believe the movie is inferior to the written work it is based on. Generally they are either cases where the work adapted is short or is (very) loosely inspired by as in the case of Do Androids Dream Electric Sheep/Blade Runner.</p>

            <p>Well, after being incredibly slow and lazy, I have completed my first mission. Of course, this calls for a beta-reader, yes? On the other hand, I&#39;m leaving tomorrow morning for a week-long trip, and I would really prefer to post this sooner rather than later.

            <p>Just so you know, there is something to be said for the &quot;leaving it for a week&quot; idea. When you come back, even without a beta, you&#39;re likely to reread yourself and want to edit quite a lot. Don&#39;t be in such a hurry! Leave it to sit. The mission, and the audience, will still be here when you get back.</p>

            <p>I&#39;d say sure right off the bat, however a) I dunno if I know the fandom and b) depending on time zones, our time frames might be totally different? I&#39;m GMT -8, so... yeah.<br><br>I don&#39;t know if you&#39;ll get any other volunteers, but defs having the fandom in the request would help -- it&#39;s a lot easier to read a mission (especially for canon consistency) if you know what&#39;s going on -- and if you don&#39;t, it probably is better to just be patient. The document won&#39;t go away, the internet (probably) won&#39;t explode during the next week, and it can only be better for the wait. After all, it&#39;s gone this long already, eh?<br><br>For what it&#39;s worth, I look forward to seeing the finished product. <sup>^</sup></p>

            <p>Naw, never mind, I&#39;m cracking up anyhow, In all senses of the word. Hello, Makaylax!<br><br>I am much to laaazy to post lynx to all the things you should visit, and I am positive someone else will, so I will just give you a big fuzzy scarf and call it a day. It is mainly electric blue, but there are other colors in there as well. <br><br>(Besides, I&#39;m not 100% sure I remember how to post lynx on this thingy. How do you do this again...?)</p>

            <p>Hello Edward!<br>Certainly more experienced than me. The last time I was on a message board was about 10 years ago, when I was besmirching the LOTR board on what I thought was the Harry Potter board, but as the Laws of Narrative Comedy operate largely in this area I&#39;m sure you can imagine where I actually posted it.<br><br>I love scarves! I have a big collection at home so I&#39;d love to add it. Hmm I see what you mean, its kind of difficult to describe the other colours when they keep swirling around like that- bit hard to keep track of...<br><br>Haha, well thanks for warning me in advance that there are things I should visit!

            <p>I have a little trouble. While the first draft of my first mission has benn Beaed successfully, the second draft (minor modifications,the only true new part is an extra piece in the ending) has been sent to Anamia, that quite disappeared. The trouble is that the ending has two of her agents (we agreed to deliver the Sue bodies to her scientists since they were probably a new species), and so I think I should wait her approval. But it&#39;s more than two weeks that the mission is ready, however. What should I do?</p>

            <p>Is it acceptable/done to have Agents whose home continua are in our own unpublished origional fictions. I feel like this is a stupid question and/or one I&#39;ve read the answer to, but I can&#39;t remember, so here I go asking it.<br><br>Basically, I ask because the ideas I have for Agents both are the above.

            <p>Agent Miah Arthur is a character originally from a fic that I deleted about 13 years ago. When I deleted the fic, I rescued the character to use as an online avatar, and eventually she ended up here. She was a bit Sue-ish in the original story, which I realized, although I didn&#39;t know what the term for that was at the time. Anyway, she put her time in de-Sueifying while she was nothing but an avatar, and is now very glad to have a world to inhabit again. :D<br><br>Agent Unger is a D&amp;D 3.5 half-elf Barbarian (went for a bit of the ridiculous there) that is based in the world of the game that we last played here.</p>

Much like yourself, I&#39;ll be fleshing everything out for NaNo this year, but she&#39;s going to be one of the main characters. It&#39;s going to be either a preternatural-based crime novel or a preternatural-based spy novel-- one of the two, since I&#39;m going to go with the whole &quot;ex-private detective&quot; bit of her history like I did here.</p>

            <p>I didn&#39;t think there would be any problem, but I wanted to be sure. The character in question&#39;s backstory was so perfect that I couldn&#39;t pass it up: he&#39;s a minor wizard (I have a list of D&amp;D 3.5 spells roughly equivalent to what he knows, and it&#39;s only eighteen things, none above 3rd-level, and only two 3rd-level) who over the course of the novel gets pulled out of his home continuum by a rift created by some crazy magical experiments. He therefore opposes badfic not because he&#39;s familiar with the continua and horrified at how people are ruining them, but because he&#39;s opposed to continuum-warping in general. His partner is a young werewolf who <i>is</i> familiar with the continua.<br><br>Also, wow, I&#39;m embarrassed by how many errors there are in my original post.

            <p>There are agents from unpublished fics already--the &quot;semi-fic blips&quot; who are generally Sues or OCs from unpublished stories. So it&#39;s not at all a stretch to think that a character from unpublished original fiction might join the PPC.</p>

            <p>(I checked with Techno-Dann and Neshomeh on this, so no freaking out, okay? Okay. Just a bit. But no more than that.)<br><br>Hey, guys, it looks like the main current Permission Givers seemed to have drifted off! Or are not doing their jobs here on the Board. It&#39;s such a shame, real life seems to have happened to them (just as planned, yes....).<br><br>Anyhow!<br><br>For most of you newbies who aren&#39;t aware of how things go, normally someone (in this case, me!) goes &quot;Hey, where did the PGs go? We need more!&quot; and then suggestions are made.<br><br>Also, there&#39;s this thing about general consensus. This means that there should be ideally be more than a few agreements that person X, Y, or H<sup>2</sup> are agreeable for nominations. Simple majority, and whatnot. <br><br>To start this thread off, I&#39;m going to nominate <b>Vixenmage</b>, because she&#39;s been around for ages, knows all the PPC stuff, and is nearly not sane. Also she is good person and isn&#39;t dead, all of which are excellent things for a nominee for PGs to be.</p>

            <p>Sorry for the subject bar, I just couldn&#39;t resist. Okay, the point is that I have decided to stop torturing myself, my characters, and my next-to-nonexistant readership by writing missions in the HP continuum, which I happen to know jack about. The SO has finally eroded enough paperwork to discover Julius&#39;s long-forgotten transfer request, and is willing to approve it...on one condition. For their next assignment, my Assasins will be teaming up with a pair of Bad Slashers to exorcise and/or kill a certain GodModeStu!Harry. Complete the mission succesfully, and the transfer goes through. Fail, and the mission is sent to ESAS and Julius and Leila stay in the Potterverse for a dozen more missions. And nobody wants that.<br><br>I&#39;ve claimed the fic, I have a very basic idea of the plot in mind, and I know I&#39;m going to go ahead with this, but I&#39;d rather team up with someone already writing Bad Slash missions than pull two of them out of nowhere. I&#39;d prefer they be a pair of relatively new Agents, just because that seems to fit the SOs MO, but since I probably can&#39;t afford to be picky, I&#39;m prepared to be flexible.<br><br>So...any takers? I&#39;m willing to write the Slashers myself, but I think it would be much nicer (and much more PPC) to team up with somebody.</p>

            <p>I&#39;d be happy to volunteer my dedicated pair of Slashers, Dana Trent and Tarian Toran. They <i>are</i> on the experienced side; Dana&#39;s a PPC veteran and has been DBS since 2001 (giving her a slightly amusing indifference to slash by now), but Tarian&#39;s been in the DBS for a little under two years and still gets very flustered and acts like a total newbie at times.<br><br>I&#39;d be willing to co-write, though it depends how you wanna do it. My personal preference is Gdocs, but if you really don&#39;t like that idea we can work around it.<br><br>I&#39;m also very good with the Potterverse in general, so if any canon queries come up I should be able to help.</p>

            <p>...And by that I mean the cartoon and not the movie (damn thing makes it hard to tell them apart now).<br><br>Apparently, there&#39;s going to be a sequel, set 70 years after &quot;The Last Airbender&quot; in which the next Avatar, a teenaged Water Tribe girl named Korra comes to the steampunk Republic City to learn Airbending from the son of the previous Avatar, after already learning Waterbending, Firebending and Earthbending. She&#39;s also apparently &quot;hot-headed, independent, passionate, rebellious, fearless, and ready to take on the world&quot;.<br><br>...Yeah, am I the only one who has a bad feeling about this?

            <p>A:tLA fan here! I apply the same mindset to this as I do to my fanning (hurray for coining new meanings for existing words?) of Supernatural: I trust the creators. They did well the first time, they have always done remarkably well. I trust their ability to make this cool. Therefore, it deserves every bit of benefit of the doubt I can give it.<br><br>Actually, I&#39;m pretty happy to hear that they&#39;re doing a sequel, and that they&#39;re doing something entirely new with it! I&#39;d be far more worried if they were trying to follow around the children of the first gang. I can&#39;t think of any good example of that. Can you guys?</p>

            <p>At first glance, I admit I was a little concerned with how this new series was described. &quot;Hot-headed and independent&quot; are hardly original descriptions for a main female character. *gestures towards his own PPC character list*<br><br>After some thought, however, I&#39;m convinced that the new Avatar series should be something to be gleefully anticipated. My reasons are thus:<br><br>-- New characters. The story of the Gaang has pretty much been told. While it might be a little interesting to see how their lives progressed, an entirely new cast of characters allows for new situations or stories to be told.<br><br>-- Korra, the new Avatar. Her personality, while hardly original (if the press release is to be believed 100%), serves a marked contrast to Aang&#39;s typical cheerful mood. Plus, now we have a contemporary Avatar, rather than one that is disconnected by the present by 100 years. If the picture is anything to go by, Korra is older than Aang was during the first show. I&#39;d quite like to see a more mature Avatar (not for that reason! Get your minds out of the gutter!).<br><br>-- The suggested storylines about city crime and anti-bending attitudes fit in with the general maturity set by the first series. I want to see how said topics are handled.<br><br>-- She already knows three of the four types of bending. Good! That means we don&#39;t have to watch more gorram training montages with fire, earth, and water. The first series had plenty of those, thank you!<br><br>-- Michael DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko (the original creators of the first series) are heading up this project. Rather them than some fan trying to redo all of the classic bits. They know what&#39;s been done, so hopefully they&#39;ll try to explore new territory and create new conflicts.<br><br>-- Steam punk is kinda cool.<br><br>I&#39;ll be looking forward to its release.</p>

            <p>Only seventy years, and Aang is already dead? :/ We&#39;ve already had several people living for over a hundred years with no problems, so why did Aang kick the bucket so early? Did someone murder him or something? And if so, how did they manage to bump off the <i>Avatar?</i></p>

            <p>Really, this makes me SO DAMN HAPPY. I have plenty of faith in the creators to pull a kickass, strong, non-Sueish, new and above all, INTERESTING character off, and a whole bunch of supporting characters. The old series had lots of dark stuff in it, so the whole rising-crime thing doesn&#39;t make me twitch, and I just love the idea of seeing what&#39;s happened to the world after the series ends.

            <p>...I really wanted to know what everyone thinks about this, especially since sequels are (usually) not as good as the original, especially one as well-crafted as Avatar: The Last Airbender was.<br><br>And there&#39;s also the matter of the next Avatar herself. Ever since I found out that characters I liked/tolerated are generally considered (by fans) to be... uh... unlikable, I&#39;ve been somewhat paranoid about new series.

            <p>Well, it didn&#39;t ruin my life. It just gave be a more technical outlook on the aspects of fiction...<br><br>One nice thing about Avatar: The Last Airbender is that it mixed, matched, and blurred tropes rather well. It was entertaining because the characters felt new and fresh, no matter how many bits of them happened to be actually pretty token. Tropes Are Not Bad.<br><br>But if the new series does not follow up this standard of quality, I admit I will be pretty sad.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m forcing myself to rein in my cynicism. I don&#39;t know how they can follow such a great act. Will the characters be as good? Will the story be as rich?

            <p>I&#39;ve just recently discovered the full extent of my obsession with the show. <br><br>While I agree that those are typical Canon!Sue characteristics, the first show also handled what could be considered other Sue-cliches (i.e. dead/missing parents, spirited kids doing cool things with special powers) very well indeed.

            <p>First of all, I don&#39;t want to begin a war with you (Unless it&#39;s necessary! Wraaah! No, no, just kidding).<br>Second, and as I said in my previous reply (&quot;Try to read better&quot; back to you), Canon!Sue was just the first thing that came to my mind when I read her description, and IT WAS NOT BECAUSE SHE&#39;S A GIRL! It was because she is described as knowing waterbending, firebending and earthbending, and learning airbending (ьberpowers, anyone?) and because she is (and I quote) &quot;hot-headed, independent, passionate, rebellious, fearless, and ready to take on the world&quot;.<br>It was a first impression! She seemed like a canon!Sue because of the description, maybe she is, maybe she isn&#39;t. Maybe saying &quot;Written all over her face&quot; wasn&#39;t the best way to manifest my actual thoughts - point taken.<br>If you were really so hurt by my first impression, I apologize.<br>And if it means that much to you, I take my words back: I don&#39;t know if she is a canon!Sue or not for I haven&#39;t seen enough of her yet.</p>

            <p>I think it might seem a liiiiitle canon!Sueish because in the last series we followed the Avatar around as he learned all his skills. This one has already done a lot of her studying... if they are not careful, her mastery could seem forced-- even if she is the Avatar. She&#39;s still young. Even Aang, although an airbending prodigy, wasn&#39;t extremely good at the other bending forms until the very end-- just competent. It all depends on the execution of her power.<br><br>She&#39;s expected to be awesome, sure. But the reason why Aang got off the hook for being Canon!Stu (he wasn&#39;t one, really) was because he was BELIEVABLY awesome.<br><br>They&#39;re going to have to make her a believable character before all else, if they&#39;re going to make her so strong right off the bat. We got to see Aang learn and screw up sometimes. We won&#39;t see all of those shenanigans with this new Avatar-- at least not for earth, fire, and water bending...</p>

            <p>We all seem to be saying we like reading.

Just got to the crossroads.<br><br>A Fortress of Grey Ice, by J V Jones - someone on my flist recced it because, and I quote, &quot;dude, I think my elf analogues are gay&quot;. Loving the series so far.<br><br>Peter F Hamilton&#39;s <i>The Dreaming Void</i>. Started it on a train. Liked, didn&#39;t quite continue, read seventeen other books instead.<br><br><i>Figments of Reality</i> by Jack Stewart and Ian Cohen. These guys are my glods.

            <p>I&#39;m currently in the middle of Robertson Davies&#39;s collection of short stories (wonderful parody ghost stories set at Massey College), <i>High Spirits</i>. I am otherwise between books, but next on my list is <i>Unexpected Magic</i>, a Diana Wynne Jones short story collection. I&#39;ve been kind of on a short stories spree this year. I also have <i>Anathem</i>, <i>Jonathan Strange &amp; Mr. Norrell</i>, and <i>The Hunger Games</i> sitting around; I may go for Anathem next, if I feel up to it. My mom&#39;s been telling me <i>The Hunger Games</i> is really good, but I can&#39;t quite convince myself of this, and until I do I probably won&#39;t pick it up.<br><br>Also on a Charles de Lint spree — the last few books I&#39;ve read (all in the last week) included his <i>Dingo</i>, <i>Forests of the Heart</i>, and <i>Little (grrl) Lost</i>, Neil Gaiman&#39;s <i>Smoke and Mirrors</i> collection, and Michael Chabon&#39;s <i>The Yiddish Policemen&#39;s Union</i>.<br><br>But. Let me take a minute to talk about how amazing Charles de Lint is. Question: how amazing is Charles de Lint? Answer: super-amazing. Think Neil Gaiman, but slightly more optimistic, and with a huge and varied knowledge of mythology. If you have not heard of him, definitely check him out.</p>

            <p>About the &quot;I wish he were writing my life bit&quot; — I can&#39;t speak to those particular books, yet. But I want that kind of magic in my life.<br><br>That is the biggest difference between him and Neil Gaiman, for me: they are superficially similar, and I like Neil Gaiman&#39;s writing, but I would hate to be stuck in one of his stories, for the most part, with a few exceptions.</p>

            <p>Mostly Agatha Christie right now. The books are quick and interesting and that&#39;s really all I have time for what with work and all. I would really like to finish For Whom the Bell Tolls and How Green was my Valley by the end of the summer, but who knows whether that will happen.</p>

            <p>I am currently working my way through all of the Sir Arthur Conan Doyle Sherlock Holmes. I&#39;ve finished <i>A Study in Scarlet</i>, <i>The Sign of Four</i>, and I&#39;ve started <i>The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes</i><br><br>Before this I read the Ukiah Oregon series by Wen Spencer. These books are completely awesome! <i>Alien Taste, Tainted Trail, Bitter Waters,</i> and <i> Dog Warrior</i>.<br><br>I&#39;ve been on a series kick this year. I read the entire Warrior cats series by Erin Hunter this last winter, which amounted to about thirty books. I started the Percy Jackson series, but I haven&#39;t been able to finish due to a slight monetary disagreement with the library (read I owe them high fines for late books and one damaged baby book).<br><br>I have started several books this year without finishing them, which is odd for me. I&#39;ve started <i>The Silmarillion</i>, and a re-read of <i>The Three Musketeers</i>. I&#39;ve also listened to several chapters of various Mark Twain novels: <i>Roughing It, The Innocents Abroad,</i> and <i>Life on the Mississippi</i>. My husband is on a quest to listen (he prefers audiobooks) to every Mark Twain book ever written. These are available with a very good reader from <a href="http://librivox.org/newcatalog/search.php?reader=&amp;mc=&amp;bc=&amp;cat=&amp;genre=&amp;language=&amp;type=&amp;author=Mark%20Twain&amp;title=&amp;status=all&amp;reader_exact=&amp;mc_exact=&amp;bc_exact=&amp;date=&amp;group=&amp;engroup=&amp;ingroup=&amp;offset=0">Librivox</a></p>

            <p>I don&#39;t read quite as voraciously now as I did when I was younger, but I&#39;ve always got something going on. Currently I&#39;ve found myself out of my usual comfort zone of fantasy and sci-fi, but it&#39;s been nice here, too.<br><br>I&#39;ve just started <i>The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo</i>, which, as you may know, has recently been turned into a movie. I haven&#39;t gotten far enough to say much about it, but I can tell you the titular girl looks to be a really awesome character. She&#39;s got the whole fascinatingly rough and antisocial exterior covering something awful that happened to her, but she <i>doesn&#39;t</i> have the angst that so often goes with that. Nothing about her says &quot;poor me;&quot; mainly it says &quot;bugger off, I&#39;m working here.&quot; Total competence at what she does, though not always in ways her boss approves of (or wants to know about, in fact).<br><br>And then of course there&#39;s the mystery, which has only begun to be introduced. All the main players have yet to hook up, so I&#39;m sure when that happens it&#39;ll really take off.<br><br>The last thing I read is <i>The Source</i> by James Michener. I recommend this if you want a really, really long, dense read that will keep you engaged every step of the way. The initial setting is an archaeological dig at the fictional Tell Makor in Israel, where we&#39;re introduced to the characters that provide a framing story to everything else that goes on. After the key finds of the dig are uncovered, the author takes us back in time to the protohumans that first lived on the Tell, and gradually brings us back up to the present (well, the <code>40s or</code>50s), visiting various points in history along the way. It&#39;s a lot about the development of Judaism and some about the other religions that sprang from the same area, Christianity and Islam, but with a historical focus. Very interesting if you&#39;re curious about religion or history at all, academically or otherwise.<br><br>Before that, I read the <i>Death Gate Cycle</i> by Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman. If you liked the <i>Dragonlance</i> series at all, you&#39;ll love this. I am not <i>Dragonlance</i>&#39;s biggest fan, but I had such a good time with this series that I almost started over from the beginning when I was done. I still plan on reading it again. Between four (well, five) separate worlds, where the usual fantasy races have each developed in a distinct manner, you&#39;ve got enough intrigue, magic, action, and drama to power a large city. ... Or seven really good books, as it happens. And as your tour guide, you have Haplo and his dog with guest appearances by Alfred, the most hapless individual you will ever meet. And I&#39;m going to stop talking now, because there&#39;s just so much I could go on about, and we&#39;d be here all day. Long story short: great fantasy; not a Tolkien knock-off; you&#39;ll enjoy it. Go read!<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Again, I&#39;m only a few chapters in. It looks to be more based on intrigue than action so far, though--the two main protagonists are a journalist and a PI, so it makes sense. And I am intrigued.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I&#39;m currently reading the Dresden Files(well, rereading them) and am about to pick up Son of a Witch.<br><br>I just finished Halo: First Strike, Fool Moon, the Peshawar Lancers and Superior Saturday.<br><br>Peshawar Lancers - I&#39;m a big S.M. Sterling fan, and a big steampunk fan, so when I found out that Sterling had written an alternate history story about a world that was stuck in the steam age due to a huge meteor storm in the 1800s, I was hooked. As with most of Sterling&#39;s books that I&#39;ve read, it starts kind of slow, but it&#39;s well worth it if you stick with it.<br><br>The Dresden Files - Jim Butcher&#39;s Dresden files are really fun to read. A bit reminiscent of Sam Spade and Philip Marlowe stories, with magic and other fantasy elements thrown in. While I&#39;ll admit that there is the occasional plothole, however the writing is good enough and the stories are so fun that it&#39;s easy to over look some of those.<br><br>Halo: First Strike - Man, the Halo books do a much better job of explaining what&#39;s going on than the games do. First Strike is a nice one that bridges the gap between the first and second games and goes a ways in explaining why the Master Chief acts as distant as he does, and why Sgt. Johnson survived the Flood. It also gives some insight into the way the Covenant works, and where the Brutes were during the first game.<br><br>Superior Saturday - The sixth, and second-to-last book in the Keys to the Kingdom series by Garth Nix. It&#39;s a good story. Unfortunately, I don&#39;t remember much of the first five books, so I&#39;ll have to go back and reread those.</p>

            <p>My favorite so far is White Night, however. I haven&#39;t read the two latest, though.<br><br>Also,I can only express my condolences regarding the Anita Blake series. My only advice is to get out while you still can. Depending on where you are in the series, you&#39;ve only got a few books left until it just turns into supernatural porn.</p>

            <p>Seriously...it was in the local ice cream shop, so I picked it up. It&#39;s called &quot;Oracles of Delphi Keep,&quot; and you are hereby forewarned. The first chapter is about a baby girl named Theodosia (Theo for short), who was abandoned by her mother and left with a mysterious letter and a mysterious crystal pendant on a gold chain. A man left baby!Sue at an orphanage on a dark and stormy night, and a five-year old name Ian has an instant puppy love connection to her. (He names her; no one knows her real name.) She&#39;s blond and light-eyed, with an oval face, round cheeks, a &quot;perfect little nub&quot; of a nose, and did I mention she has a birthmark on her right shoulder in the shape of an eye?<br><br>Yes, that&#39;s <i>all</i> in the first chapter.<br><br>So, as you can imagine, once I&#39;d read through it, I quickly put it down and read the latest issue of <i>National Geographic</i> instead. Before that, I read Tennyson&#39;s <i>Idylls of the King</i> (Arthurian legend in glorious blank verse), and before that, some prophecies from the Bible. </p>

            <p>It&#39;s an Italian &quot;jumped on the Harry Potter bandwagon&quot; about a boy who has lost both his parents to the big evil and is the key in fighting that evil.

Also dogs, vibrant and eye-searing colors, good and well-thought-out AUs of the non-high school variety, this place, hand-knit socks and hats, the theatre, friends, friendly acquaintances, people who put up with me talking too much, and much much more.<br>Dislikes: Simple misspellings that could be caught by anyone with half a brain and an elementary grasp of phonics (alternately, a spellchecker), contrived plot, blatant misuse of the English language (&#39;voice&#39; in prose is one thing. Rampant unintelligibility is another.), pressure, those songs that get played literally every opportunity possible on the radio, and bad movie adaptations. And so on.<br>Other: I have two settings so far as socializing: almost completely mute or talking ears off. :D <br></p>

And chatspeak, spelling errors, and bad grammar. I work as a proofreader, and I have a knife. You have been warned.<br>Other: On both Livejournal and FanFiction.Net I am &quot;Sedri&quot;.<br></p>

            <p>I am neither shocked nor horrified that you have read the Twilight books.  To be honest, I have seen the first two movies and I will agree that the bits that are not Bella and Edward centric are rather interesting.  There is a cool world there. . . hidden behind a cardboard cutout and a lump of glitter.</p>

            <p>The attributes given to vampires are biologically ridiculous, but if you take it as a fantasy world and discard the angst-ridden love story that covers 85% of the text, it&#39;s interesting.

            <p>Agreed! I don&#39;t know that many <i>Star Trej</i> fans in person, but TNG seems to dominate everyone&#39;s likes. Not that TNG is bad; quite the reverse. But I will always have a soft spot for <i>Enterprise</i> because it&#39;s the only one I watched as it came out. Except I missed season two.

Um, let&#39;s see... Stargate SG-1, Stargate Atlantis, Discworld, Narnia, Eureka, Firefly/Serenity, Warehouse 13, CSI, CSI: NY, NCIS, NCIS: LA, Star Wars, ST:TNG, ST:Voy, Are You Being Served?, Monty Python, Nero Wolfe, Sherlock Holmes, Leverage, Lie To Me, Rocky Horror, Riese the Series, Sanctuary, Harper&#39;s Island<br><br>The list goes on and is continually changing...<br>Hobbies: Writing (both fanfic and original fiction), reading, hanging out with my friends &amp; family<br>Likes: the cheesy made-for-tv movies on the SyFy channel, books, the Nostalgia Critic/ Nostalgia Chick movie/tv reviews, The &quot;Minds&quot; machinima series (save for Felix&#39;s Mind), chocolate, good books/fic, steampunk<br>Dislikes: Not much, save for retch-worthy physics in a movie, bad writing, OOCness, people who use chatspeak in their everyday speech, people who are intolerant of other peoples&#39; views, the vocal minority who give religions and other social groups a bad name<br>Other: I&#39;m a closet (no pun intended) slash fan, mainly for Stargate Atlantis, even though I don&#39;t write it myself. I tend to latch onto side characters, and often it&#39;ll be those that people aren&#39;t particularly fond of, like Doctor Kavanagh from Stargate Atlantis. I proudly claim the title of geek girl, and don&#39;t care what people think about that. I&#39;m a fraternal twin (though people rarely believe it when they see my twin; we&#39;re both girls, but she&#39;s 5&#39;9&quot; and a redhead, and I&#39;m 5&#39;2&quot; and a brunette), have at least three &quot;adopted&quot; brothers, and tend to laugh at vaguely inappropriate moments during movies. I have an odd sense of humor, and am rather snarky when the mood takes me. I have been part of two ARGs (Alternate Reality Games), including one that&#39;s currently ongoing.</p>

            <p>Name: Miah<br>Gender: Female<br>Nationality: American (Don&#39;t call me a Yankee, I&#39;m Southern!)<br><br>Fandoms: Sherlock Holmes, NCIS, Stargate SG-1, Stargate Atlantis, Monty Python, Anne McCaffrey, Star Trek (except Voyager and Enterprise), Star Wars (Episodes 4,5,6 and some of the extended verse, especially the X-Wing series), LotR, Mark Twain<br><br>Hobbies: Writing original and PPC fics, Reading original fiction and fanfics, research, making overly detailed plans that I know are not likely to amount to anything, being overly optimistic, making pictures of characters.<br><br>Likes: Goodfic, reviews, chocolate, brownies, iced tea, Chinese food, reviews, chatting, Cajun food, learning new things, documentaries, reading out loud to my kids, cuddling with my husband, reviews, movies based on comic book characters. IC fics of any sort, but I am particularly fond of non-sex hurt/comfort. (Whump: all about torturing the character and then putting them back together again without the sex that is common in standard hurt/comfort.)<br><br>Dislikes: Cleaning house, bugs, pollen, mold, heat (basically the outdoors 9-10 months of the year), sudden changes, face-to-face interactions in groups of less than about five, stupid rules, OOCness, canon breakage, cinnamon flavored candies, mornings, glitchy or slow computers and programs.<br><br>Other: I am pretty much Miah everywhere I go. Occasionally I am Miah<em>79 (like on the wiki) or Miah.Arthur (like my gmail) or Miah</em>Arthur (like my LJ), but Miah is always in there somewhere. I write Agents Miah Arthur and Cali Still in DMS Freelance; RC 4096 (The Lair). I also write Agents (David) Kelok and Unger recently transferred to the All-Purpose Department, Sherlock Holmes Division; RC 1729 (The Fire Pit). <br><br>I am working on understanding and writing humor, and improving my use of dialogue. I have a real problem with grammar, like a grammar phobia. It doesn&#39;t make sense. It has variable applications. Nothing can be said, &quot;Always do this with this thing&quot;. Anyway, I do try, and I always request a beta that can check grammar before I publish a mission or interlude. That doesn&#39;t stop me from making errors in Board posts, chats, and emails, though.</p>

            <p>I really like music as well. I have eclectic tastes. Many types of rock--oldies, classic rock, older heavy metal, and 90&#39;s punk. Electric blues, Irish pub songs (especially The Dubliners!), bluegrass, and big band.  Some of my favorite groups are: The Dubliners, Ozzy, Rob Zombie, Drowning Pool, Blink 182 (before they grew up), The Offspring, Creedence Clearwater Revival, Queen, Pat Benetar, The Blues Brothers, Johnny Lang, Allison Krauss</p>

            <p>Here, have some facts on me:<br><br>1. My name is... I&#39;m not telling. Privacy is an extremely important thing to me, though I will say I have an identical twin, and that I&#39;m male (As is my twin). I&#39;m not exactly a very confident person when it comes to... well... anything, really. What I have been told, however, is that I&#39;m an amazing writer and roleplayer by people on the internet.<br><br>2. I first started writing stories as a way to vent my anger and other emotions, as well as to escape from my loneliness and general other negative crap. I&#39;ve kinda grown out of that now, and have changed from minor wish fulfillment crap to exploring the concept of fiction itself and generally making the fourth wall less than non-existent (As seen in my entry for Fanfic Land, &quot;Things Unsaid&quot;).<br><br>3. I have a bit of an odd belief that fiction is &quot;real&quot; in a very odd, vague sense. After all, we end up creating such incredibly detailed worlds and people... Nothing too crazy, though. My tendency to overdevelop my characters&#39; personalities and create them first and foremost as people as opposed to just characters for a story probably stems from this.<br><br>4. I have very slight feelings for Alice Alexandria, my Breloom pokemorph character... Let&#39;s just leave it at that... Doesn&#39;t help that she&#39;s one of the most developed characters I have, personality-wise...<br><br>5.I&#39;m interested in quite a few video games, including Pokemon, NiGHTS Journey of Dreams, Monster Hunter, Left 4 Dead, and more recently the Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion. You can blame my friends for that one. I don&#39;t watch much TV, finding the internet a far more reliable source of entertainment.<br><br>6. I LOVE MUSIC. Music is one of those things I wouldn&#39;t be able to live without! Except country, I hate country.<br><br>7. You probably know this, but I lack a sense of humor. Hardly anything is funny to me, and I can&#39;t write humor for my life.<br><br>...And yeah. That&#39;s all I&#39;m gonna disclose.<br></p>

            <p>I think there are probably people in philosophy or literature exploring that idea. It reminds me a little of the way Plato talked about essential concepts being more real than the things that took the shape of those essential concepts; or the way sociologists and psychologists talk about archetypes or about the way ideas spread and take on a life of their own.<br><br>Ideas are powerful and very, very real. And fiction is a kind of idea. So in a way, fiction *is* real; it&#39;s just not <i>material</i>.</p>

            <p>In one sense, a literary character is as real as the second cousin you always hear about but have never met. A literary character will often be <i>more</i> real to you than that second cousin. And these characters are real enough and internally consistent enough; we might as well view them as actually real, except for one thing: they don&#39;t actually exist anywhere in the world that&#39;s physically accessible to us.<br><br>Our fictional characters are as real as anything else, philosophically speaking, they just happen to not physically exist...</p>

            <p>My characters, in particular, tend to take on lives of their own in my head; sometimes I find questionnaires or interview-style things online, or friends send them to me, that are designed to expand your OCs&#39; details a bit more, so you know more about their motivations etc. and aren&#39;t writing someone one-dimensional. And most of the characters I run through them just overflow with details as soon as they get the opportunity. I sort of have difficulty with the idea of considering them just words on a page/screen when they&#39;ve got full lives, backstories and families developed in my head.<br><br>And they tend to pop up in some of my IM chats to comment on a subject they find particularly interesting.</p>

            <p>Well, I&#39;m going to take your format and modify it slightly, &#39;cause it works and it&#39;s easy. {= )<br><br>Name: Neshomeh<br>Gender: Female<br>Age: 25<br>Nationality: American<br>Fandoms (copied from my wiki page): Animorphs, Babylon 5, Battlestar Galactica (2003), Discworld, Dragonriders of Pern, Farscape, Firefly/Serenity, Fullmetal Alchemist, Harry Potter, Heroes, House, M.D., Jekyll &amp; Hyde (book and musical), Lord of the Rings, Phantom of the Opera (Leroux, Kay, and Webber), Young Wizards, etc. I&#39;ll also add Sharpe, because while it&#39;s not a major fandom of mine, it IS an awesome one. <sup>_^</sup> I should add How to Train Your Dragon, too, &#39;cause that movie is made of win and one of the PPCs I&#39;m working on is set there.<br><br>Hobbies: <a href="http://marysueacademy.proboards.com/index.cgi">St. Dymphna&#39;s Academy</a> tops the list right now. It&#39;s awesome and anyone who likes role-playing who isn&#39;t already there should join up when the next game-year starts. Shockingly, my hobbies include role-playing (online and tabletop). They also include writing, reading, drawing, drinking tea, and listening to music. I sing, but I haven&#39;t been able to join a group since I moved, which is really sad.<br><br>Likes: Barid, tea of almost any kind, cats, chocolate, <s>long walks on the beach</s> humor, things making sense, making things make sense, music, learning about new things.<br><br>Dislikes: The corporate system, bad writing, bad science, people who don&#39;t think before speaking/hitting &quot;send&quot;, people who whine about being inferior, especially while exhibiting no signs of willingness to improve; sudden loud noises.<br><br>Other: I go by Neshomeh pretty much everywhere--deviantART, ff.net, Fiction Press, Photobucket, probably others. There are a few exceptions, though: on Gaia Online I&#39;m  Neshomeh<em>soul because someone was actually using Neshomeh when I got there; on Neopets (where I don&#39;t really go anymore) I&#39;m Neshomeh</em>soul because my original account got deleted for a stupid reason; and on YouTube, it&#39;s not me. I don&#39;t have a YouTube account. My contact information, should you want it, is on my wiki page. A lot of the information in this post is on my wiki page, too, in case you want to look it up in the future. It would be nice if everyone&#39;s information were on their wiki pages in case people wanted to look them up in the future. *hint hint*<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Every once in a while, I get asked why my emoticons have hats, and I&#39;m sure the number of people confused by this far outnumbers the number who actually ask. So, here&#39;s why:<br><br>Mainly, <a href="http://farscape.wikia.com/wiki/Pilot_%28Moya%29">this guy</a>, the Pilot of Moya, from Farscape. You see, lo these many years ago, before I&#39;d even heard of the PPC, I was a member of a message board rather like this one in terms of friendliness and free-for-all geekdom, only it was centered around Pilot. We were, in fact, the Friends and Defenders of Pilot, or FaDoP, which when pronounced is a play on the word for how we felt about Pilot&#39;s general neglect and occasional outright mistreatment by the rest of the crew. To show our love for our gentle navigator, we did various things, such as write fic, or role-play, or use fancy emoticons with a curly bracket to represent Pilot&#39;s carapace. After Farscape was canceled, the forum slowly disbanded, but the carapaced emoticon lives on with me. Basically because I got into the habit and never bothered to break it.<br><br>So, there you have it. {= D<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>So we notice someone&#39;s spotted Pads calls herself inactive on the wiki, and Trojie&#39;s not been around for a while. We feel it’s time for an explanation of our absence. May it be thought-provoking.<br><br>Basically, we don&#39;t feel terribly comfortable here any more.<br><br>Pads has got, on one side, people touting us as amazing and legendary to newcomers, but on the other, a crapload of people constantly failing to realise there&#39;s more to the PPC than just &quot;See Sue. Chase Sue. Kill Sue.&quot; It’s confusing, and fairly disheartening.<br><br>Trojie, meanwhile, got damned uncomfortable (and seriously considered dropping out of the PPC entirely) when we were accused, as a group, of bullying. But all of the accusations, and all of the rebuttals, focused on the DMS. Where was Trojie&#39;s place in that? She felt very much like she was unable to even participate in the debate, because the debate was all about the morals of killing Sues, even when it was supposedly framed in terms of mocking fic in general.<br><br>We&#39;re a diverse group of people, and while a lot of people here do just focus on Sues, there&#39;s more to the PPC than that. But sometimes it&#39;s hard to find that out - everyone from TVTropes to UrbanDictionary has us down as nothing more than Sue-slayers.<br><br>We’ve a lot of fics on our To Kill list, and we’ve plans for them. We’re looking forward to writing them, whenever the hell Pads’s sanity decides to come back and Trojie’s education stops kicking her in the arse. We’d kind of like to feel welcome and included enough to be able to release such missions, whenever they turn up.<br><br>We’ve a lot of mpreg missions on our list too. We’d like to be able to release them to a community that recognises the implications of that cardinal rule: Your Kink Is Not My Kink. As it stands, when people can claim mpreg is the product of diseased infant minds and no one here stands up to say otherwise, Agents Oscar and Iza would be better off retiring.<br><br>So we&#39;re wondering, it&#39;s been a long time since TOS and the Constitution of this Board were written, and the PPC has grown since then - could it be time to hash out a somewhat more inclusive general statement of intent? One that states that “we mock badfic”, rather than just “we kill Sues”?<br><br>To us, the PPC is a place to espouse good fanfic writing practices; to have a laugh at bad fanfic writing practices; to practise our own writing in a shared setting; and to have fun, no matter what kind of fic one likes or dislikes.<br><br>What is the PPC to you?</p>

            <p>As far as general definition goes: The PPC is an MST-inspired parody done within the context of a much larger frame story. That&#39;s the simplest way to put it.<br><br>More than that, the PPC is a shared story-universe, because the frame story tends to overwhelm the MST aspect of it. This isn&#39;t a bad thing. The frame story--the plot protectors themselves, headquarters, etc.--is so very fun to play with. The ability to treat stories, and their constituent words, as the makeup of a physical world? Fun! Characters with the ability to move from one story world to another? Fun! Characters who, due to various comedic circumstances, complain like hell about these fantastic things? Fun! And funny.<br><br>And finally, the PPC is a community. We all have different reasons for being here, from respect for art to love of snark to simple love of the community itself, but this is a strong community. Futhermore, it&#39;s a common-interest community, so we get along well and have a lot to share with each other.<br><br>However... Because everyone has a different reason for being here and doing what we do, I think a general statement of intent can be difficult to formulate. If you say we are here to kill Sues, then you leave out the bad-slashers. If you say we are here to fix badfic, then you leave out the people who are just here for the comedy or the neat frame story. If you say we&#39;re here to write PPC stories then you leave out the people who just hang out in the community--and so on. The PPC was not originally intended to be what it is, which is something permanent and to a certain extent serious. Once the PPC turned into a community, rather than just Jay and Acacia&#39;s fun project, it was put into a state of flux. At the moment, the PPC is simply what its community uses it for. Perhaps that is how it should be, perhaps not. But for the moment? We are what we do, and our purpose here is to do it. That&#39;s all.<br><br><br>P.S. Sorry if that seems unhelpful? If writing a general &quot;this is what the PPC is, and this is why we&#39;re here!&quot; statement were easy, we would already have one, and it would work for everyone. But it isn&#39;t easy, and so I&#39;m just trying for clarification, really. I understand why you guys don&#39;t feel comfortable here, I think. I have felt the same way, at times. But it speaks well for the community that you can bring these things up, and have them taken so seriously.</p>

            <p>... but wasn&#39;t sure whether to release them because of them not being mission-related - they deal a bit with Agent Foxglove&#39;s less-cheerful-than-she-claims past and Agent Laburnum&#39;s psychological problems and gender identity issues, and while I may think it&#39;s fun to torment the girls, I wasn&#39;t sure if it would make people uncomfortable since they don&#39;t consist of squishing Sues in a humorous manner. I also have some bits of bonding between the agents and the M-kids, which is more funny, but since I couldn&#39;t find a mission to fit it into I wasn&#39;t sure if people would want to see it. <i>Would</i> people like to see stuff like that? Character development is fun.<br><br>Even the Bad Slash stuff I spork tends to involve a character replacement that needs killing, just because that&#39;s what I know how to do.

            <p>I like interludes. A lot. I don&#39;t know if you&#39;d get a lot of feedback on them, in general, but I&#39;ll read them and comment. Character development is a good thing--especially in such a cool world as the PPC.<br><br>Honestly, I&#39;ve noticed lately that no one is getting very many comments on missions or stories of any sort that are posted. I can&#39;t speak for everyone else, but getting comments, even if they don&#39;t amount to anything other than &quot;I read this&quot; is really encouraging to me. <br><br>I know not every Department or style of spin-off is for everyone, but as long as we&#39;re on community issues and making people feel like they are a part of the community, I feel like we should, as a community, work a bit more toward supporting people who are producing PPC stories--whether the stories are dealing with Bad Slash, Mary Sues, strange cross-overs, strange AU&#39;s, PPC history, character development of our agents, or any other crazy PPC thing somebody dreams up.</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve found myself not looking at missions as much lately (being blocked from The Pit might have had a bit to do with that, but eh), and focusing more on character development. Though I have to admit, a lot of it&#39;s been stuff like &quot;Meet Your Character&quot; interviews, which can be fantastic for finding out about them and how to write in their voice, but isn&#39;t necessarily of interest to anyone else.<br><br>My most recent and favourite works of character development, ironically, haven&#39;t even been developing my characters so much as introducing them - my spinoff co-written with Lycaenion, which was started because of the RPs I was doing with her which were killing her Agent Teek&#39;s chances at getting a better-rounded personality. Weirdly, I grew fond enough of Teek to offer her one of my lot as a partner in place of the guy who regularly sent her into howling rages, and the rest, as they say, is history.<br><br>I love character development pieces, and have written a handful for several of my Agents&#39; backstories, but I do get a nagging sense of guilt at times that I should be writing missions if I&#39;m gonna do PPC-related stuff, because that&#39;s what people wanna see.<br><br>...I think what I was trying to say was that I agree with your points. XD I ramble at inappropriate times.</p>

            <p>My thoughts on the matter are simple: Find badfic, write an interesting tale about it, where the badfic is fixed, and everything returns to normal. Of course, I haven&#39;t tested those thoughts in a story yet.</p>

            <p>A lot of fandoms are like Rodney Dangerfield: they can&#39;t get no respect. To me, the PPC is an (albeit sometimes extreme) example of people fighting back for an accurate depiction of the stories they love.<br><br>Humankind have been telling stories almost as long as we&#39;ve been humans. Early cave paintings were a method of telling stories--even if it was just &quot;there were three guys, and they stabbed a buffalo.&quot; As our society evolved, so too did our methods for relating information. Stories entertain us, give us messages, tell us stories about who we are and what sort of world we live in. They can make us think or they can make us cry.<br><br>Fanfiction is part of that great literary tradition, too. The first work of fiction, the Epic of Gilgamesh, can be considered RPF--talking all about the fantastical adventures of a real person. But today, with universal communication and universal access via the Internet, there&#39;s an awful lot of people out there who aren&#39;t treating fiction with the respect it deserves. Authors like Tolkien put their heart and soul into creating whole worlds for us, and people use it as cheap wish-fulfillment. <br><br>PPC stands for <i>Protectors</i> of the Plot Continuum. Not Avengers or Inquisitors or anything like that. The purpose of the PPC is to, in some way, try to restore the status quo and preserve the works of fiction in their original form. Sure, it can sometimes get lost under the dark humor and Sue-slaying. But it began with anger over the way a great work of fiction was being mistreated, and that&#39;s how it continues. At its heart, the PPC is about respect for art.<br><br>. . . and now that sounds pretentious as hell. But that&#39;s what I think, and that&#39;s why I like it.</p>

            <p>Before I found the PPC, I really had no concept of fanfiction besides &#39;movie/TV/literary characters sleep with each other regardless of actual personality.&#39; They weren&#39;t really things I actively sought out. I didn&#39;t even know what a Mary Sue was.<br><br>I joined up because of how solid the community seemed. Almost everyone appeared to be a lot like me: smart, witty folks who didn&#39;t really take themselves that seriously. I wanted to practice my writing in a community like that.<br><br>It was actually trying to avoid the typical SCK pattern that I found the most difficult thing while writing my first missions. I scrapped quite a few drafts because I felt that my focus was shifted away from jokes and character interaction to the eventual assassination. There are still a couple missions where I think I fell into that trap.<br><br>That concern was one of the major reasons why I developed a Bad Slash team. I&#39;ve actually had an easier time writing Bad Slash missions as compared to Mary Sue missions, not to mention more fun. And hey, if you&#39;re not having at least a little fun writing a story then you&#39;re probably doing it wrong.<br><br>I have no idea if anything I just wrote makes any sense in regards to the original post. If it helps, then that was my intention. If it&#39;s gibberish, than ignore me.</p>

            <p>When I first joined, it was for the purpose of bashing badfic.<br><br>I&#39;m not terribly good at humor, and I&#39;m a hater of badfic. I tend not to get jokes, and the ones I do are... well... not exactly standard humor.<br><br>But--I&#39;m going to get corny--the PPC is more than that. I didn&#39;t quite realize that when I joined; I&#39;m a grammar Nazi at heart, and I find idiots hard to deal with.

            <p>The PPC has always been a community to me. I love the fact that I can talk about super geeky things and people won&#39;t act like I&#39;ve got two heads. I&#39;ve met a lot of good friends here. I was also introduced to the PPC by a good friend, but she hasn&#39;t been around for years. <br><br>I&#39;ve never been a &quot;See Sue, Kill Sue&quot; person. I don&#39;t write missions (but I read them) and the humor in them is the most important thing to me. I love anything that is funny and mocking badfic, man...<br><br>Writing is one of my passions and the PPC is great about helping others improve. I never thought we were bullies. I wasn&#39;t around when a lot of the srs bzns stuff went down, so I can&#39;t really comment on that. </p>

            <p>If it were just about killing sues, there would be little point in developing characters at all for our stories. Same with mocking badfic. It isn&#39;t about those to me, it&#39;s more about creating an enjoyable story with interesting characters while doing those at the same time. Yeah, hard to believe, coming from me, of all people... Who doesn&#39;t even have permission yet... But it just makes sense.<br><br>...Kind of ironic, how I&#39;m saying this, but... I&#39;ve still got a point. I&#39;m not here for the sue-killing, or for the mpreg-bashing or whatever, or even for the badfic mocking...<br><br>I&#39;m here to enjoy myself. I&#39;m here to write for the sake of writing. I&#39;m here because WHY THE HELL NOT. <br><br>I enjoy writing darker stuff, and I don&#39;t understand the humor in the slightest, so what? We&#39;re a community of writers, not badfic haters or comedians or monsters or anything of the sort. I do realize that there&#39;s more to this than the sue-killing, and I&#39;ve tried to show it in my writing for this far too many times to count, despite it being hopelessly rejected or put under the mask of being a joke even though it&#39;s entirely serious. I just want to write, that&#39;s all.<br><br>The PPC is far more than killing stuff for fun. It means something to us, because otherwise, we wouldn&#39;t be here discussing it with you, would we?<br><br>And to me, the PPC is about expressing ourselves, and the world we&#39;ve made to express ourselves with. Art is about expression, and writing is a form of art. Even if I&#39;m not funny in any way, shape or form, or if I&#39;m writing what&#39;s the complete opposite of what the PPC is supposed to be about in your eyes, I&#39;m still part of this community because I&#39;m expressing myself through what we&#39;ve made as a group.<br><br>...And that&#39;s how I feel about the subject, completely unfiltered and uncensored. The PPC means something to me, perhaps even more than you people might understand. To me, simply seeing all of us work together to create something like this is amazing, and that&#39;s enough for me to keep trying.<br></p>

            <p>(Just to keep up my one-post, now two-post, trend of pretentious titles.)<br><br>Before I say what I meant to say, I should get out of the way the fact that every time I see &quot;we kill Sues&quot;, the only thing I can think of is the &quot;movieplot&quot; function of one of the IRC bots on a channel I frequent, which gives a movie plot like this: &quot;He&#39;s an all-American sweet-toothed jungle king on the wrong side of the law. She&#39;s a cynical psychic femme fatale with her own daytime radio talk show. They fight crime.&quot; Just switch &quot;They fight crime&quot; for &quot;They kill &#39;Sues&quot;.<br><br>I cannot speak to past issues, but I can talk about what the PPC is to me, and later speak from mostly ignorance about the variety of subject matters in PPC stories.<br><br>The reasons I liked the Original Series were not the killing of &#39;Sues, but the fact that Jay and Acacia picked up on the things I notice even in my daily life: punctuation errors, spelling mistakes, capitalization errors, the kinds of things that create new characters who have one line. The kinds of things that make My Immortal so much fun to read — funny as it is without this interpretation, it becomes even more surreal and bizarre if you interpret each misspelling of a character&#39;s name as a new character. Also there are constant references to characters doing things &quot;4 Eva&quot; or &quot;4 eva&quot; or &quot;4eva&quot;, but no detail is ever given about the character of Eva. One has to wonder...<br><br>But I digress. The point is, the Original Series focused relatively little attention on the deaths of the &#39;Sues. In short, what I like about the PPC has nothing to do with killing &#39;Sues and everything to do with the rest of the content of the stories — the interactions between the Agents, the interactions between the Agents and canons, the adoption of spelling errors when appropriate, the travel sickness as the stories covered vast distances in a single word, etc. Not that I enjoy travel sickness, but you know what I mean.<br><br>In the grander scheme of things, speaking from ignorance, I think one of the problems is that &#39;Sues are just plain easier to spot and attack. If there&#39;s a female character joining the Fellowship, either in addition to or in place of one of the natural Nine, that sets alarm bells ringing. If a <i>The Dark is Rising</i> story stars a girl who isn&#39;t Jane, that does, too, even before she&#39;s revealed to be Bran&#39;s half-sister or Will&#39;s American cousin. It&#39;s much more difficult to spot bad slash if the structure of the story is decent, that is, if it&#39;s capitalized, spell-checked, etc. appropriately.<br><br>Coming from that perspective as a Star Wars fan, I think we should be wary of always taking the easy path — as everyone knows that&#39;s a surefire way to fall to the Dark Side.<br><br>As other people have mentioned, the PPC at its best is not about killing &#39;Sues, but about protecting and restoring canon. It&#39;s right there in the abbreviation: Protectors of the Plot Continuum. &#39;Sues are just one of many ways to do that, and I think other ways tend to get overlooked because they require a bit more consideration.<br><br>As far as non-fic related things, the reason I like wandering around TVTropes or reading OFUM — not having been here too long, I can&#39;t really speak for the PPC just yet — is that I like seeing that other people enjoy the things I enjoy, fandom-wise, and knowing that I&#39;m not the only one who&#39;s read and loved, for example, <i>Animorphs</i>. With people in real life, I tend to get eye-rolls and &quot;Oh, those were great when I was in elementary school&quot;. <i>They&#39;re still great!</i> I want to yell, but that would be awkward.<br><br>Final point: as far as espousing goodfic, the problem I see is that there isn&#39;t really a way for the PPC to do that, besides its primary endeavor of mocking badfic. The first thing that comes to mind as a solution would be having, like, a &quot;featured goodfic&quot; on the main page of the Wiki, but beyond that I don&#39;t know how much it&#39;s possible to do.<br><br>Hope someone found that comprehensible/interesting/useful.<br><br>Regards,<br>Lleu Llaw Gyffes</p>

            <p>To me, the PPC is a place full of nerds where I can be nerdy.  More specifically, where having an anal-retentive knowledge of an obscure 80&#39;s TV show or an out-of-print novel is not only accepted, but <i>celebrated</i>.<br><br>That&#39;s what the PPC boils down to for me: a celebration of the fictions we&#39;ve loved.  I think its inherent humor revolves around the fact that we&#39;re writing about stories we love and enjoy, and we want others to get that same good feeling.<br><br>Maybe, if we go through with the &quot;new image&quot; plans, part of it can be focusing on the canon being restored to its former state at the end of the mission, and make that the climax more than the Sue-kill, or whatever?  The PPC: Battling Badfic to Cure Canon.<br><br>(I guess that wasn&#39;t so brief, which is appropriate, because I&#39;m a boxers guy.)</p>

            <p>I haven&#39;t been here long. At all, really-- but even before I came here I was doing badfic parody.<br><br>And now a friend and I have an epic spin-off fanfic in the works with PPC themes in it. It&#39;s over 50 pages and in progress, and is likely to span over novel-length. And we have sequels in mind, too. Whether or not it will ever be posted, remains to be seen.<br><br>I love exploring fandom. I love exploring what people think and get out of their favorite modern-day mythologies. I love exploring mindsets that can go into interpreting canon. I came here because really, that&#39;s what this is about-- one, more mature mindset, poking a bit of fun at a less sophisticated (and kind of embarassing) mindset from the past and showing how goofy it is. <br><br>I know so many people who have &#39;gotten over&#39; the Mary Sue thing, or as extension, the entire badfic thing. It&#39;s one mindset. It&#39;s not right, but then again, neither is the mindset of an assassin.<br><br>But like those goofy cubical-top-mounted Nerf dart turrets, or packing peanut catapults set up in office buildings worldwide, it&#39;s a goofy and unthreatening sort of war I personally fight. <br><br>So I don&#39;t feel bad for hanging out here yet. Or writing long goodfic (I hope!) about an Urple Nexus infesting all of Assassin&#39;s Creed.</p>

            <p>Well, I&#39;m a newbie here, and I&#39;ve already come across some stories that are exactly that (See Sue, Chase Sue, Kill Sue). <br>I intend to write a spin-off as soon as I can, and I&#39;ve been researching everything I can (from PPC history - Reorganisation and such - to lots of other things).<br>One of the principles that I think is fundamental for the organisation, regardless of department or division, is the Rule of Funny. If people don&#39;t follow it, let them be, but don&#39;t give up because of it. I&#39;m not censoring you for taking a break, but really, if you don&#39;t like what you&#39;re reading because it&#39;s not funny enough, close the tab (if your browser has tabs. If it hasn&#39;t, I suggest you upgrade it). I&#39;ve done it half a dozen times.<br>But if you leave, then you&#39;ll be reducing the output of good (funny) stories, and you&#39;ll be contributing for the &quot;Sue-slayer&quot; reputation.<br><br>This may seem a bit like emotional chantage, and that&#39;s exactly what it is (joking).</p>

            <p>Recently I&#39;ve been lurking for similar reasons, although I was already mostly invisible by the time the whole bullying thing cropped up.<br><br>I don&#39;t think we&#39;re bullies. If we went after the <i>authors</i> then that label might be justified, but such actions would be condemned by the community as a whole, or at least so I would hope.<br><br>I&#39;m sorry for not speaking up about that idiotic remark about mpreg, but I didn&#39;t feel that I had the right to speak up. I&#39;ve been barely here for so long, that I feel that there&#39;s no one who&#39;d listen if I did try and engage someone over a comment about a genre that is one of the most disliked (and usually badly done) in fanfiction.<br><br>What attracted me to the PPC, like many other people, is the humour. I wandered in through OFUM, and I enjoyed the way a group of talented writers were able to turn Mary Sue fics into something funny and worth reading. And, despite the way the people here on the Board mocked bad fanfiction, they also loved <i>good</i> fanfic. This was somewhere where I could just be a fan, and learn something about becoming a better writer in the process.<br><br>But then we started getting floods of Tropers with the wrong ideas about the PPC. Emergencies and crises became commonplace. Everything became SRS BZNS for a while. I faded into the background because I wanted no part of that. Even when the law was laid down, I continued to lurk. I was content on the fringes, only commented on rare occasions.<br><br>And then I realised that all the newbies that were flooding in were getting Permission and starting their own spinoffs. I saw all these new writers adding to PPC canon and contributing to the whole, while I get writer&#39;s block within about two sentences every time I try and write a mission. I felt like a failure, so I stayed quiet still.<br><br>I won&#39;t lie and say I read every spinoff. Not everyone&#39;s writing style appeals to me. I will say, though, that DMS/Sue-killing missions are my least favourite type. They&#39;ve become formulaic, as you&#39;ve summed up with your statement of &quot;See Sue. Chase Sue. Kill Sue.&quot; Would I read Sue-killing missions if they weren&#39;t so formulaic? Probably.<br><br>If I&#39;m a lurker, why am I still here? Because of friends. There are some wonderful people in this community, and I&#39;d feel bad if I left completely. Despite everything, this is a good community and, if we make a little effort, it&#39;ll stay that way for a long time yet, I hope.</p>

            <p>...the PPC <i>is</i> about exposing badfic, but it&#39;s also about talking to a fun group of people who like goodfic, being able to help my own writing by talking to them and knowing they won&#39;t flame you or be all &quot;You&#39;re crap, get out.&quot; It&#39;s about a community of people who like good writing and having fun. </p>

            <p>It&#39;s a whole lot of things, honestly. Awesome people, writing that&#39;s entertaining -- without a whole lot of serious, angst, or drama, a shared love of good writing and the light-hearted mocking of bad writing. (And by bad writing, I do mean just bad writing, not writing with distasteful subject matter. YKINMK, after all.)<br><br>I&#39;m not very vocal on the Board, though I do hang around the IRC a lot, and I&#39;ve made good friends here. The shared universe we all play in is delightfully wacky and enormously hilarious, and... my train of thought left me standing at the station.<br><br>Point is, at least for me, the PPC isn&#39;t just see sue -- chase sue -- kill sue. It&#39;s a whole bunch of other awesome things with a bit of cathartic suekilling thrown in. <br><br>There&#39;s my two cents, for posterity and whatnot. I&#39;ll follow what this thread brings up with interest.</p>

            <p>We&#39;d just like to say we&#39;re glad you guys aren&#39;t <i>gone</i> gone. Neshomeh in particular misses you guys, and is really sorry you felt unwelcome, and wants you back as soon as you want to be back.<br><br>We agree with what Calista said about many people being uncomfortable with slash/mpreg sorts of fics, and that&#39;s probably a partial explanation for why so few people go that direction with their agents. It actually obeys the &quot;your kink is not my kink&quot; rule. Also, it is really easy to spot a bad OC; other things aren&#39;t always so clear.<br><br>On the other hand, we also agree that our image outside of the community needs some serious, serious attention. It&#39;s true, places like TVTropes and whatnot tend to focus exclusively on the Sue-slaying--probably because it&#39;s a common, well-known concept and they don&#39;t bother to investigate us any deeper. That&#39;s why we had such an issue with the So Sue Me people, too. They lumped us in with everyone else without stopping to find out what <i>really</i> goes on over here, and because that&#39;s all they were concerned about, that&#39;s the only way we could talk to them. So, for that reason, we&#39;re all for getting the real story out there as much as possible. There are some Tropers around here who can at least get on it over there.<br><br>It&#39;s not that we don&#39;t love you guys and your writing. We do. You contribute significantly to the diversity of this place, which is why we want you back. It&#39;s not that we don&#39;t support Bad Slashers and Disentanglers and everything else. It&#39;s just that Sues are so gosh-darn easy to go after. It&#39;s probably related to the fact that they&#39;re so gosh-darn easy to write, and write badly, in the first place.<br><br>However (again), we agree with Sedri that lots of Sue-missions focus too much on getting to the kill and less on the poking the bad writing and hilarious effects thereof. In Barid&#39;s words, the kill should be a punctuation mark in the sentence of the overall mission, and we&#39;re both attempting to make it so in our work.<br><br>Incidentally, Neshomeh is on a hunt for crossovers in her fandoms that are bad enough to PPC that don&#39;t also contain a Sue or a character replacement. Harder to find than you might expect.<br><br>We would also like to mention FicPsych, which we&#39;ve noticed has been focusing more and more on agents lately. Neshomeh didn&#39;t mean to set a trend when she wrote Ilraen&#39;s story; it was meant to be a fairly unique occurance. We&#39;d like to see someone write about the nurses dealing with canons. Neshomeh has plans for one of these.<br><br>As for what the PPC is for us...<br><br>For Barid, the PPC is jokes, gags, and funny. He tries to bring the funny in his writing. He is not interested in writing, or reading, agents one-upping the other guys with their assassinations.  His agents are in the All-Purpose Department for a reason.  He has plans to deal with badfic in the Warcraft continuum that do not deal with Sues.<br><br>For Neshomeh, the PPC has always been about writing practice, learning to write humor, sharing interests in books, crazy rambling discussions, and FUN. She has a history of sharply curtailing people who try to make the PPC into <b>SRS BSNS</b>, and she will continue to do so. <br><br>~Neshomeh (who isn&#39;t sure how coherent this post is, but hopes it helps) and Barid (who recently had quite a lot of fun reading Agents Trojie and Pads&#39; escapades during the gender-bender incident).</p>

            <p>I&#39;m not very active on here, mostly I just lurk, but the reason I wanted to be apart of this community was for the humor. I loved TOS, because they were funny, not particularly because they killed Sues.<br><br>And what this leads me to is saying that I think the missions you two have been writing have followed more in the tradition of TOS than most I&#39;ve read. Baring TOS the Trojie and Pads missions are my favorites, no contest. It would make me very very sad if you stopped releasing missions.<br><br>And about changing the Constitution, I think it&#39;s probably about time, seeing as the PPC has grown so much. As you say, there&#39;s more to it than just Sue slaying.<br><br>Other than that I don&#39;t have much to say, although it would be a very great pity if you stopped releasing missions.</p>

            <p>The PPC is a place that makes good stories out of bad ones. Anyone can make an acerbic review, but the PPC makes entertaining, funny stories out of honest critique. Yes, there is a large focus on Sue killing. But there is a much larger focus on making fun characters who bounce off each other well.<br><br>Also, I would like to take the opportunity to thank both of you for your plethora of amusing and entertaining missions.

            <p>I&#39;ve been kind of lethargic lately in terms of missions. I have one that I&#39;m working on that I&#39;ve stopped working on and haven&#39;t continued working on for about a half a year now. Lately I&#39;ve been spending my efforts on MSTs, which for some reason are more fun than actual missions. Really, the Sue-killing part has faded into the background, and right now I&#39;m mostly having a bunch of fun fleshing out the two agent pairs I have now, as well as polishing up a third pair to introduce eventually, when I have a few more missions up for the ones that I&#39;ve already made known.<br><br>The PPC, at least to me, is no longer about just finding bad fanfictions and poking fun at what&#39;s wrong with them, though this still is a large part. Really, I see the PPC as a place where I can cement my knowledge of the do&#39;s and don&#39;ts of writing, and I can have a lot of fun while doing so. Personally, I love the creativity that goes into the PPC canon itself, and writing my characters in such a wacky setting is loads of fun.<br><br>So... yeah. The PPC, to me, is pretty much about having fun and learning how to write better. I was always under the impression that this was the point of the PPC to begin with.<br><br>Hope this helps.</p>

            <p>I initially came across the idea of killing &#39;Sues (well, more of the plot bunnies that create them) via Bitemetechie&#39;s wonderful BunnyBusters series, found <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2998389/1/">here</a> and <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3273033/1/">here</a>. The PPC reminds me so strongly of that- the general snarkiness of the characters, the main point of the stories, and much more- but honestly, what mainly attracted me to the PPC was the sense of community here. I&#39;m not sure what you mean by the whole bullying thing, as I&#39;m relatively sure I joined after all that went down, but I can see how it might affect people. For instance (and isn&#39;t it funny how life works), one of the people I did drama with last quarter had a story of hers that had a mission written about it, and told me about it a few weeks after I joined the PPC. She wasn&#39;t particularly happy about it, but I could see why the fic needed to be taken care of.<br><br>People never like criticism, even if it&#39;s just gentle satire that&#39;s poking fun at a particular idea. That goes beyond the realm of fanfic as we all know, so it&#39;s not particularly anything new. I agree that the general purpose of the PPC is more than anything to mock badfic, and I know that I&#39;ve been guilty of focusing mainly on taking care of Mary Sues. I&#39;ve a plan to remedy that, but it&#39;s probably not going to be until I finish this bit of character arcing I&#39;ve started for one of my DMS agents. <br><br>As for what we should do about it, I rather like the idea of there being a sort of in-universe image revamp. I know I&#39;d have fun seeing battle-weary Agents, regardless of Department, trying drum up recruits at say, a job fair or a convention (SDCC maybe? It&#39;s current... *shrugs*) and just <i>wishing</i> that they could be out fighting &#39;Sues or Slash-Wraiths or whatever. My mind works in odd ways, yes, but then again, who has a normal mind here, anyways?<br><br>And that, more than anything, is what I like about the PPC, and I&#39;ll say it once again- the community. I know I&#39;m excited about the Seattle Gathering that coming up soon, and I&#39;m already planning to get up Glod-awfully early to get there on time. That&#39;s all I&#39;m gonna say; I know I&#39;m rambling.<br><br>Pretzel<br><br>P.S. Oh, and the vocabulary. I&#39;m lovin&#39; the vocabulary. I already picked up stuff from <i>Firefly</i>, but now I&#39;m using things like &quot;glauranging&quot; and &quot;Glodawful&quot;. Thanks. ;)</p>

            <p>A little over half of the missions I have written (if I count the one I just finished that isn&#39;t published yet) do not deal with Sues. I tend to worry a lot more over the non-Sue missions, because of the &quot;Your kink is not my kink&quot; issue. Maybe that is a good thing. I put a lot of thought into choosing those fics, asking myself if I would read a story along those lines if it was well done. Sometimes I decide, no I wouldn&#39;t and pass it up. I honestly don&#39;t like mpreg stories (although I can admit to you having shown me at least one humor based one that was good that I did like), so until I can answer that I could be happy reading non-humor based mpreg, I won&#39;t be targeting them. There are several other things that I can think of I won&#39;t be targeting, and several things I can think of that I wish were done well more often. I think I am probably harder on the things that had the potential to be something I would have liked, but went the badfic route instead of working at it. Then when I pick one like that I worry about whether I am being too harsh, because my expectations were high. <br><br>If you (or anyone else) ever see anything I&#39;ve done that you don&#39;t feel was appropriate, tell me. I really don&#39;t want to judge it wrong and target one I should have left alone. Anyway, lots of worrying, and all centered around the missions that don&#39;t have a pink glittery sign blinking over the whole fic shouting &quot;I am a Sue! Someone kill me please!&quot; Those are a lot simpler in terms of group consensus as to what is good and bad.<br><br>Reasons I joined the PPC:<br>1. It&#39;s a lot of fun.<br>2. It&#39;s a pretty nice community that also broadens my horizons a bit, because it such a diverse group.<br>3. To improve my ability to write humor.<br>4. To improve my ability to write dialogue.<br>5. To mock badfic.<br>6. To have a place where I can receive feedback from reviews, betas, etc. in a relatively safer environment than the publishing industry, from a group of people who adhere to a strict goodfic policy and as a community are willing to help each other become better writers.<br><br>(I really hope that I have actually said what I am trying to say. I&#39;m sorry if I didn&#39;t.)</p>

            <p>Good question.<br><br>It&#39;s a place where you can mention how you used to rip the heads off of Barbie dolls when you were a kid, and you get a handful of replies that quickly turn into a discussion on Barbie dolls, branching out into how terribly <i>wrong</i> they are to give impressionable young girls, and on the other branch, on how much fun it is to mutilate them. <br><br>It&#39;s a place where you can post some strange, weird, quirky news story that looks like someone gacked it from a Neil Gaiman short story, and people react by creating a world around it, or just with interesting conversation.<br><br>It&#39;s a place where you can tell someone, &quot;You&#39;re cool and all, but honestly if you don&#39;t start capitalizing your proper nouns, I <i>will</i> turn this flamethrower on you,&quot; and you get eight cheers, two eye-rolls, and one wall of text about the dogma of capitalizing the pronoun for yourself, and how postmodernism exposed it.

            <p>The PPC&#39;s changed my life for the better. It introduced me to a world where good writing was valued above all else. That was the first thing that I picked up when I wandered into the place - &quot;We Like Good Writing And Laugh At Bad&quot; - and, believe it or not, it actually shifted my entire career focus. I&#39;m studying to become a proofreader now <i>because</i> the PPC reintroduced me to my lifelong love affair with the English language.<br><br>I&#39;ve met people I class amongst my best friends through the community here, both in real life and online with plans to <i>make</i> it to real life meetings. We&#39;ve always tried so hard to be welcoming to new people; I still have fond memories of my arrival back in April 2008, when everyone was planning the Mary Sue Invasion, and I was flailing and going &quot;Huh? What? Someone please explain what&#39;s going on?&quot; until several very kind people pointed me in the direction of explanations. I felt nervous at first, but that very quickly disappeared under the barrage of &quot;Hey, welcome, join in!&quot;<br><br>I&#39;m not as frequent a poster here as I used to be, but the good thing about this place is that it doesn&#39;t matter. At all. We just enjoy each others&#39; company whenever we get it. I know this sounds cheesy, but the PPC&#39;s a great big bad-writing-mocking family, and we care about each other. And I wouldn&#39;t have stuck around so long if we didn&#39;t.</p>

            <p>You&#39;re my friends, and I had no idea you felt that uncomfortable, and that unwelcome. I&#39;m sorry. :(  <br><br>I know I&#39;m more than guilty of being vicious with the killing of Sues in my missions, but from my perspective, that&#39;s not what missions are about at all. When I think of the PPC, the first things I think of are the absurd gadgets and the use of plotholes like doorways - the mind-boggling manifestations of bad writing. Yes, I use mission-writing as a way of relieving stress when I&#39;m upset or frustrated with a particularly bad badfic, but what I&#39;m most proud of - and what I remember most about what I&#39;ve read or written - are things like the Capillary Towel, or the navigation of HQ&#39;s corridors; the things that make us so different from characters like Bourne.<br><br>Regarding the bullying argument... once it was over, I more or less ignored it. I don&#39;t believe that we are bullies or that we ever have been, though I can see why some people may feel attacked. I don&#39;t know if it helps you, Trojie, but in your shoes, I would&#39;ve been happy to see that my department wasn&#39;t really involved in the debate - the fact that &quot;PPC&quot; had been essentially equated with &quot;DMS&quot; seemed like less of an issue than the fact that we were mocking fics at all; Sues were just the easy focus. But I see where you&#39;re coming from.<br><br><u><b>Maybe there&#39;s a way to remedy this.</b></u> Maybe we could all, as a community, make a point of toning down the death-focus in our missions, or take the time to write something set in the PPC that isn&#39;t a mission. Maybe those of us whose agents are assassins can have them branch out, be more versatile - tackling highly OOC fics and performing exorcisms rather than killing replacements. There are many options. <br><br>Any takers? Can we arrange to do more things like FanficLand, perhaps? Can we make a group effort to mock non-Sue badfics? I don&#39;t see why we can&#39;t. Perhaps we could even create an in-universe explanation - nothing as dramatic as the Emergencies (perish the thought), but perhaps the Flowers will decide that the PPC&#39;s public image (*cough, cough*) needs improvement and so make non-Sue missions priority for a while? <br><br><br>As for amending the constitution and such, I&#39;m all for it. Go forth and tweak.<br><br>Did I answer your question? I think I did. To me, the PPC is about silliness and poking fun at badfic, with a tactful definition of what is &quot;bad&quot;. I generally stick to Suefics because I am very good at telling when an OC is a Sue or not, and avoid bad slash missions because I&#39;m no judge of slash. I always PPC fics that are to the extreme end of &quot;bad&quot;, not the middle-ground ones. However, in light of what you&#39;re saying, I see no reason why I can&#39;t cart my agents off to work on OOC fics for a while - it&#39;s not like we can&#39;t spot bad characterisation. And that would be more fun (and less destructive), which is, as you say, the point.<br><br><br><br>...So will you please come back? I&#39;m not kidding when I say I feel awful. I miss you two.</p>

            <p>I mean, I know some agents get worked up and homicidal; and it&#39;s pretty much excusable when they&#39;re facing tiny-waisted, urple-haired, personality-free creatures who are basically mind-raping the canon characters and endangering entire worlds that the agents love.<br><br>But...<br><br>It&#39;s never been about killing Sues. Even in the beginning, the point was to get the characters back in character, get the continuum back in shape, repair the damage. And however homicidal agents get, it&#39;ll always be about the canon.<br><br>I do think that sometimes we end up writing agents who step somewhat out of character when they kill their Sues. Some agents do really have the capacity for true cruelty; but most really don&#39;t. Most agents want to protect the continuum, do the Duty; so sometimes I think maybe writers go a little overboard with assassinations, having their agents do things that are unnecessarily painful, which said agents don&#39;t seem like the type to do.<br><br>Many agent pairs I know of are the type who should really prefer quick, clean kills; or else arranging things so that the canon itself gets to kill the Sue (things like locking gazes with the Basilisk in Harry Potter, for example; I think it must help repair the canon to have the Sue die in a canon-appropriate fashion). But some writers seem to feel like they&#39;ve got to make Sue deaths painful and dramatic, when their agents just really don&#39;t seem like the type, even when utterly enraged, to do anything more than just shoot her down like a dog (apologies to dogs everywhere) and make sure the canons are okay.</p>

            <p>You&#39;re absolutely right; some agents do go overboard. Part of the reason I haven&#39;t written missions in a while is because Agent Sedri has become increasingly bloodthirsty, and I&#39;m not comfortable with that. Her first mission, it was personally offensive, but after that there was no need, and I freely admit to getting carried away. That has to stop, so right now I&#39;m idling and creating a new partner who will rein her in a little.<br><br>Anyway, what I meant to was how the missions can sometimes shift focus so that a larger percentage of &#39;time&#39; is spent on the kill than on the laughing and charge-gathering... which, on second thought, may be what you were talking about anyway?</p>

            <p>Whether expressed by overly painful/elaborate deaths or just by spending most of your time writing about the actual assassination, shifting focus onto killing is generally a bad thing.<br><br>Have you considered therapy?

I have no faith in its usefulness in the real world, let along in Fic Psych where their only concern is whether an agent can still walk and read out charges.

            <p>I see people mutilating the books I love, and it&#39;s just so wonderful to read fics that show people setting it right. Simple as that. Plus, there&#39;s the opportunity to write what I guess is metafiction--something I&#39;ve always liked, ever since I realized the concept existed--basically, stories about stories.<br><br>Killing Sues isn&#39;t particularly important to me; it&#39;s more of a means to an end. This would be why I&#39;ve put my agents in Floaters. I want to try them all--exorcisms, geographical aberrations, messed-up crossovers, kidnapped canons, and yes, Mary Sues.<br><br>I learned some writing tips from the missions I read. I can only hope that other writers will eventually learn from the ones I write. If I can get past the writer&#39;s block on Page Five of mine, that is. :P<br><br>Something else I like about the PPC is the concept of the PPC itself. The idea of an organization that polices fan fiction just tickles my fancy. I keep on working out the details of the &quot;rules&quot; of the PPC continuum--which are internally consistent, despite the fact that they&#39;re nothing like the way our world works. (My standard approach when I fall in love with a new continuum is to find out everything about it.)<br><br>In the PPC, everything depends on irony and humor and Murphy&#39;s Law; and they&#39;re real &quot;laws of physics&quot;, enforced by a Legal Department, no less. Even the inconsistent things have an explanation--HQ is just that weird, and what else would you expect from a place that runs on plot holes and has access to dozens of continua with time machines?<br><br>Also: The relief from angst, from &quot;badass&quot; characters, and from general taking-itself-way-too-seriously fiction. It&#39;s nice to see characters who face death and insanity every day without wangsting or turning into musclebound Schwarzenegger clones. I love watching underdogs succeed; and that&#39;s what PPC agents basically are. Very, very snarky underdogs, in most cases, which makes it even better. Even the &quot;serious&quot; PPC stories avoid the overly-dramatic issue. (Does anybody read the webcomic &quot;Order of the Stick&quot;? It&#39;s done a very similar thing, creating serious plotlines while keeping a great level of humor, much like the PPC.)<br><br>And of course there&#39;s the benefit of talking to other people who also love books. That&#39;s always a bonus for me; in real life, I mostly meet people who are into video games or TV shows, and I don&#39;t get the opportunity to talk about books all that much.</p>

            <p>I was originally drawn to the PPC&#39;s wiki by the humor I found on the TVTropes page. Through the wiki, and the stories I discovered via said wiki, I discovered a community of genuinely cool people who enjoyed writing humorous and occasionally serious stories parodying some of the worst fanfic out there. Not out of any desire to be malicious, but rather for humor&#39;s sake, and to make those badfic slightly more tolerable. Anyone who says that the PPC is a group of bullies has obviously never bothered to get to know the members, or payed close attention to the wiki. After all, the other thing the PPC is about is helping people write better. That&#39;s why we have a whole chain of beta-readers, and why we&#39;re willing to give tips to fanfic writers outside of the PPC to help them write better. Because that&#39;s what the PPC does. They mock badfic, but they&#39;re not mean about it. They&#39;re always willing to help those who want it to write better.<br><br>As a side note, I really do hope that Trojie and Pads continue to write new PPC stories. It may sound a little silly, but I kind of look up to you two, and hope to be as good of a writer as you two are one day. You guys are also part of the reason why I&#39;m planning on focusing more on badslash once I get around to requesting permission.</p>

            <p>Granted, not as many people seem to find it as easy to spork bad slash, but I&#39;m fairly confident in saying that in the community, at least, bad slash <i>missions</i> are generally dearly loved, hence your fame. I personally keep meaning to try to find a new fic for my Bad Slashers, or a crossover, because I&#39;m getting a little tired of seeing Sue-missions everywhere I turn.<br><br>In short, I think you&#39;re right. We&#39;re not just a Sue-sporking community, we&#39;re a community for mocking bad writing of all kinds and (just as importantly) celebrating good. Bring back the PPC&#39;s beloved diversity!</p>

            <p>Many of us are just plain squicked out by bad slash; or maybe embarrassed; it can be difficult to get past the stomach-turning badly-written smut. It&#39;s a lot harder than picking out the plotholes and glitter in a Suefic; there&#39;s nothing embarrassing about complaining that the Sue has urple hair, whereas if it&#39;s a canon who&#39;s mysteriously got an urple penis, then it&#39;s a bit more squicky. There&#39;s a reason the vast majority of legendary badfics are smutfics.<br><br>One of the obstacles I see myself facing is the difficulty of writing about something I don&#39;t have any personal experience with--I&#39;m a female asexual, and a virgin, and my knowledge of sex comes from my own research.<br><br>But I definitely intend to give Bad Slash a try, just because it&#39;s a different concept, and because slashwraiths are fascinating, diabolical little creatures and I&#39;d like to get the chance to observe one firsthand.</p>

            <p>And yes, it can be difficult to write about sex and spot mistakes if we&#39;ve never had any ourselves, but I like to think I&#39;ve picked up a fair bit about the do&#39;s and don&#39;t&#39;s from my time here so far. Trojie and Pads have definitely been responsible for a large part of that, mostly because they answer any queries I&#39;ve raised with them quite frankly.<br><br>(Also, the urple penis comment made me giggle rather more than it should have done. The PPC&#39;s done a lot to lodge my mind firmly into the gutter. I find things like that squick me out a lot less than they did when I joined.)</p>

            <p>Well, folks, that&#39;s a week, and the 2010 FanficLand Game is over. I&#39;d like to thank everyone who joined in; I, for one, had a great time. All the new chapters, bios, and reviews have been sent off to hS, and whenever he has time, they will be uploaded onto <a href="http://fanfic_land.webs.com/">the FanficLand website</a> for future &#39;enjoyment&#39;. <br><br>Also, just for the fun of it, I&#39;m interested in knowing just who was beind every one of the terrible but hillarious entries. No one&#39;s in any way obliged to respond, if you want to keep your alter-ego a secret, but most of us made aside comments with our &#39;real&#39; names anyway, so please, speak up and claim credit for your atrocities. I&#39;ll start by shamefully confessing to being the author behind both the childish fangirl &#39;Lady Cyskia&#39; and the rude, holier-than-thou grammar snob &#39;Honest Critic&#39;. They were a great deal of fun to write. <br><br>Anyway, many thanks to all our FanficLand contributers:<br><br>Aeidhryn<br>Alice Alexandria<br>brandywine_baby89<br>Burning Watier / Burning Visionary<br>Canon Queen<br>D4rkm0k<br>Elintyra Lloysinthayr<br>HotUkuleleLover<br>JayBird<br>KawaiiKisses<br>MoggetsGur<br>NiGhT-fIrE-wOlF<br>Nillig-Rot<br>Rae365<br>Satlie bisqut<br>slasherchicsxx0930xxxx<br>The Dreaded Saltshaker<br>Veridienne</p>
