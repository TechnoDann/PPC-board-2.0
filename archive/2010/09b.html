<li>If an Agent goes insane to the point of not being able to function, what happens to them? Are they kept in FicPsych for eternity? Are they returned to their home continuum? Or do they just wander HQ forever, babbling about whatever drove them insane?<br><br>2. Let&#39;s use a theoretical example for this next one. Say a badfic has Harry and Hermione summon <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloody_Mary_%28folklore%29">Bloody Mary</a> so they can take over Hogwarts. Harry and Hermione would be exorcised and any replacement-Sues killed, but what would happen to Bloody Mary? Urban legends and folklore don&#39;t really have a continuum of their own, after all. And would artificial urban legends like the <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSlenderManMythos">Slender Man</a> be treated any differently?</li>

            <p>I don&#39;t think there&#39;s any one answer to these, but since it&#39;s a FicPsych question, here&#39;s my take:<br><br>FicPsych would certainly try to rehabilitate an agent who&#39;s that far gone, and they do have a very secret, very removed from the beaten path inpatient facility. They would certainly keep a close watch on anyone likely to be dangerous. However, given limited personnel, that number would have to be very small, restricted to only those most desperately in need of their particular brand of care. They are very good at what they do, though, and since they have loads of experience with agents who&#39;ve lost it, I&#39;d say their chances of rehabilitating most people are pretty good. And if you think it would make an entertaining story, I&#39;d love to see you write it. {= )<br><br>As for the second question, again, whatever seems like it would be the most entertaining is probably fine. I don&#39;t think there&#39;s any precedent for that sort of scenario, and even if there were, it would depend on the circumstances in the fic. That said, simply banishing anything that was summoned ought to do the trick.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Just something that&#39;s been puzzling me.<br><br>I love to read, and I&#39;ve found that good metaphors can really help get a reader more emotionally involved in a story. Yet, in reading PPC missions, it has struck me more than once that mission writers can show a profound dislike for metaphors. Why is this? Does the PPC always consider them a bad thing, or are there certain criteria?</p>

            <p>We really need a wiki article on that...<br><br>But yeah, what the others are saying is pretty close to what I&#39;m thinking, too. If you&#39;re reading along, and you come to a metaphor and you automatically interpret it as the figurative meaning, then that&#39;s a good, non-obstrusive metaphor. (Or simile. They work much the same way.) On the other hand, if you&#39;re reading along and the metaphor is jarring enough that you&#39;re suddenly picturing it literally, or you&#39;re trying to figure out what it means--that&#39;s the kind of metaphor where the continuum will struggle to interpret it and finally just settle on the literal version.<br><br>One caution to fellow autistic-spectrum writers, though: If you tend to take things literally by nature, remember that tendency when you&#39;re checking for misuse/abuse of metaphors. When I was a kid, I took things ultra-literally, finally got annoyed enough that I studied an idiom dictionary meant for non-native English speakers, and got the hang of it, with the result that now I use metaphors frequently, and often metaphors that are original to me. So I&#39;ve actually swung to the opposite end of the continuum, and have to watch out that I don&#39;t over-use the things. Bottom line--if you&#39;re autistic, or if you tend to take things literally for some other reason (simply nerdiness can be enough and there&#39;s plenty of that here!), be careful about metaphors.</p>

            <p>I have made fun of some that would have been just fine in another story. For me, once the story has crossed the badfic threshold where things are manifesting literally, no metaphor is safe from literal interpretation.<br><br>In the zombie fic I did, the story said something like Mary Watson&#39;s eyes were &#39;aflame&#39; with passion. I probably would not have a problem with that in a generally good story, but by that point in the story, I was a seriously ticked off reader, and not willing to give the story any slack in the suspension of disbelief area. The phrase caused her eyes to be on fire. <br><br>I know I only go the absolute literal translation route under extreme annoyance.

            <p>There&#39;s nothing inherently wrong with figurative language, but if a fic is badly written enough, there&#39;s no reason for me to believe that the writer knew what they were doing when they used it; no benefit of the doubt = manifesting metaphors.<br><br>Also, taking things literally is funny, which is really the important thing. {= )<br><br>This isn&#39;t the first time this has come up, though.

            <p>Personally, I&#39;ll poke fun at or charge for metaphors when they&#39;re badly done, confusing, or absurdly unnecessary for the story. A metaphor that&#39;s well done will slip right past me as I read, and that&#39;s a good thing.<br><br>So how about this FAQ answer be something along the lines of:<br><br><b>How do I handle metaphors and similies and such? Do the Word Worlds take everything literally, and if so, should I charge for it?</b><br><i>Not if it&#39;s done well. Metaphors and similies, when properly used, enhance the storytelling process and are undoubtedly a Good Thing. The problem comes when fanfic writers misuse or overuse them, particularly when it causes confusion for the readers. Generally speaking, if it doesn&#39;t bother you while reading, don&#39;t charge for it. However, if the badfic you&#39;re PPCing is already pretty bad, then the Word World will already be weakened and chances are that such phrases as &quot;eyes aflame&quot; will manifest literally. </i><br><br>(Structured like so, though, it might be better in the Mission Writing Guide.) Anyone want me to add something/take something out?</p>

            <p>One of the books I&#39;m currently reading is a writing guide, which also covers attractive writing and the use of metaphor.  It gives a strong warning about using imagery and metaphor. In serious text infotainment can have negative impact. And humorous writing may only be funny on the screen of the author.<br><br>Personally, I have a rather low tolerance for metaphor. Too many metaphors cause me to think outside the story, because they make me think of something that isn&#39;t in the story. Send me outside the story too often and I&#39;m staying out of it, i.e. I&#39;m not going to continue reading it.<br><br>I don&#39;t think PPC-ers always think metaphors are a bad thing.  Just the ones that are only funny to the author themselves. Plus, it is fun to make fun of something that was intended as funny.</p>

<li>Yes, they&#39;d stay in Medical or FicPsych, depending on their particular needs. Most of the time, agents who go nuts tend to be psychotic rather than just garden-variety traumatized or depressed, probably because the badfic has been re-writing their brains. While it has some things in common with schizophrenia or some kinds of bipolar mania, this condition is not the same thing as either one of those real-world diagnoses. World One doesn&#39;t have the facilities to treat badfic-related disorders; the only such facilities are located at HQ (and possibly some other metafictional continua). To have any chance of recovering, insane agents would have to stay at HQ.<br><br>2. Depends. The first possibility is that Bloody Mary or the Slender Man would simply be an OC with that name, and dealt with like any other OC. The second possibility is that they would be dealing with the real Bloody Mary. There seem to be characters who have an existence beyond a single continuum of the multiverse. Only a very few are known. Among them are Lady Contrivance and Lord Implausibility, Sekhmet and Imhotep from Egyptian mythology (encountered by Suicide and Ithalond in the HPverse), and all omnipotent beings. These have all been known to pop in and out of the continua at will, entering badfic without portal technology. Notably, Sekhmet and Imhotep are both (non-omnipotent) deities who are part of World One mythology. Bloody Mary would be similar--as an urban legend, she is part of modern mythology. So in this case the agents would be dealing with the real Bloody Mary. Not being omnipotent (if she were, badfic would force character replacement rather than OOC), she&#39;d be forced to go along with it until someone did a few exorcisms or cast a few <i>Avada Kedavra</i>s... at which point, watch out.</li>

            <p>1) I think they&#39;d almost certainly be kept in FicPsych until they can be treated and restored to health or, the rules of time and aging permitting, they die. Maybe they&#39;d be sent to a mental health care ward in the Real World, if possible (non-Humans certainly wouldn&#39;t go unnoticed), but I&#39;d think they&#39;d be kept in FicPsych because, presumably, with all the advanced technology, magic, and plotholes available, there&#39;s a much better chance of treating them there than elsewhere. I certainly don&#39;t think they&#39;d be left to wander HQ; even PPC agents aren&#39;t so callous as to ignore a (potentially - scratch that - <i>definitely</i> dangerous) loony who&#39;s wandering around. IF they&#39;re found (and don&#39;t get lost in the plotholes of HQ corridors), that is.<br>However, I don&#39;t know if this question has ever been raised before, so don&#39;t take my word as final. Let&#39;s see what others say. <br><br>2) I&#39;m not sure. Not being a specific character, there would be no way to measure a folk character for OOCness - and actually, in a Potterverse fic, something like that is more likely to be allowed than not, given the nature of their magic. Artifican urban legends, however, might be something you can treat more like a standard continuum. Still, what isn&#39;t written down in prose isn&#39;t a Word World, so chances are you&#39;d have a mess on your hands regardless. Personally, I&#39;d just avoid taking on badfics with those kinds of random elements.</p>

            <p>1) I would say any of those. Depends on your liking - like so many things ;-) Seeing as the Flowers are not much concerned with the well-being of the agents they wouldn&#39;t take any particular action as long as you stay away from flamethrowers and such ;-)<br><br>2) You could just exorcise it away I guess (in the Bloody Mary case) or it would disappear as soon as the continuum fixes itself. I don&#39;t see any reason, why artificial urban legends would be any different. <br>There is one more idea - take them to the Supernatural continuum and let the Winchester brothers take care of them ;-)</p>

            <p>Greetings, newbie! Welcome to the PPC community! Just be careful around here, because you may never know what may lurk around here (no offence to anybody). Anyway, just get yourself acquainted around here, so we may get to know you better, and who knows? If your interest in writing PPC missions has fully bloomed until then, then you may or may not need to spend more time here before it&#39;s time for permission!<br><br>Anyway, we hope that you enjoy your visit here!</p>

            <p>I was thinking, What would happen if an agent from the real world got exposed to pure Narrativium? My thinking was that if a real person or an Agent from world one was exposed to pure Narrativium, it might give then the ability to imperfectly use abilities from the word worlds. The reasoning behind why this would work is that because if Narrativium is the elemental substance of Story, then getting exposed to a ridicules amount of it would but one in touch with the local cannon. The downside is that the Agent in question would be more heavily affected by changes to the cannon and the laws of dramatic irony and narrative comedy would jump at the chance to affect the agent.<br><br>I admit, I started thinking about this when I wondered what happened to all of the Narrativium in a good story when it gets turned into a badfic.</p>

            <p>Since Narrativium is the substance of story, anyone in a story is already exposed to it. If they&#39;re the main character, like a PPC agent, there&#39;s naturally more of it about them than (for instance) a bit character. This is why the Laws of Narrative already affect agents as they do.<br><br>As for good stories vs. bad, I would say that good stories have high concentrations of Narrativium, whereas bad stories have only diffuse amounts. In other words, they don&#39;t hold together well.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Poor Stormsong was the victim of a gruesome death which actually had reason to be in the plot, which naturally means the related Narrativium takes longer to dissipate from around him than it does for your average badfic victim.</p>

            <p>I probably shouldn&#39;t be as nervous as I am... Right, then! <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/edit?id=1iHtYtR4OpcQgnFmceB86bSlKtlnrq11Wgz-qK0IIJG0&amp;hl=en&amp;authkey=CMyxi9wP">Writing sample</a> first! Then, here are my Agents!<br><br>Name: Connie &quot;Chalk&quot; Girard<br>Species: Human<br>Age: 17<br>Home Continuum: Real World<br>Department: Bad Slash<br>Fandoms: Wicked, Phantom of the Opera, Guys and Dolls, Harry Potter, Left 4 Dead, Resident Evil, and some others.<br>Skills: Speed, strategy, and an endless amount of enthusiasm.<br>Anti-skills: Wow, is she bad at aiming that tranquilizer gun.<br>Weapons: Stolen tranquilizer gun from the MGS continuum.<br>Appearance: Chalk is <i>tiny</i> wisp of a girl. She&#39;s barely five feet tall, and appears smaller thanks to Jenka&#39;s bulk. Her forearms are an ever-changing mass of ballpoint-pen tattoos, and are usually bare. She keeps her blonde hair in a ponytail when it&#39;s not stuffed through the back of a cap.<br>Personality: Chalk is a never-ending fountain of energy. She loves musicals, and frequently bursts into whichever song she feels is appropriate for the time. She also has a very bad case of both sticky fingers and pacifism, the latter of which will result in her getting a bad shock when she runs into her first Replacement-Sue.<br>Backstory: Born in America to French and English parents, she moved to New Caledonia when she was eight. She immediately joined the PPC once her parents thought she was old enough to handle it.<br><br>Name: &quot;Jenka&quot;<br>Species: Ex-zombie<br>Age: Unknown, mid-twenties<br>Home Continuum: Unknown<br>Department: Bad Slash<br>Fandoms: Harry Potter, Resident Evil, Left 4 Dead.<br>Skills: Raw power, able to take large amounts of damage without dying.<br>Anti-skills: He has almost no natural healing skills, and thus needs to manually stitch himself up after being wounded.<br>Weapons: Fingernails and teeth. He cannot spread zombie-ism anymore, so no worries there.<br>Appearance: Jenka is, technically being dead and all, rather greyish-green and stitched up. His specific appearance is still stabilizing, and pretty much the only thing that stays constant is his hair and eyes (both brown, the former short). He is tall and bulky, but how tall and how bulky fluctuates. His current clothes are a pair of shorts modified from one of Chalk&#39;s skirts, and one of Chalk&#39;s uniform jackets worn with the arms tied around his neck.<br>Personality: Jenka is rather blunt. He doesn&#39;t share any of Chalk&#39;s enthusiasm, and occasionally finds her annoying. Even so, he sees himself as a bodyguard for her. He does whatever is necessary to get the job done and keep her safe, whether that includes taking away whatever she steals or kicking a bit character off a bridge. In his free time, he looks up zombies in a futile attempt to determine his home continuum.<br>Backstory: Jenka was a random zombie in a badfic whose sole purpose was to bite the main character and then &quot;vanish.&quot; When he did the latter, he ended up roaming the halls of Headquarters. He ran across Chalk one day when she was fresh out of training, and she promptly shot him and the walls full of tranquilizer when he tried to attack her. He woke up in Medical minus the urge to eat people and plus an actual mind. After a personality transplant, he was immediately partnered with Chalk and shooed away.</p>

            <p>That overconfidence thing you said in the mission is something I have said for a long time. I saw a study once (sorry no link), that talked about those programs and pointed out that often times the kids that scored the highest on the tests were the biggest troublemakers, rule breakers, and lowest achievers. They often failed at everything, but were totally happy about themselves while they were doing it.<br><br>Self-confidence of the healthy kind does not come from being told you&#39;re doing great when your not. I&#39;ve always believed it comes from knowing that you are competent.  People look at me funny over this sometimes, but my kids (age 9 &amp; 10) know how to run all the major appliances in the house, how to take care of their own things, how to cook several basic meals, and how to take care of several other types of things. They know they can do these things. They do not feel helpless to meet their own needs, and they don&#39;t get to feel that sense of entitlement that I am their maid. If they decide they want to learn something like cooking or sewing or whittling, then I will help them with it, teach them how, give them room to make their mistakes, and then give them pointers on how to continue to improve. <br><br>They might not score the absolute highest on the self-confidence tests, but they have a more realistic confidence.  </p>

            <p>I completely agree about the self-confidence thing.  I myself have gotten bad scores on tests before due to overconfidence and optimism.  Kids are taught nowadays &quot;do your best,&quot; which is laudable, but it needs to be followed by, &quot;make your best better.&quot;</p>

            <p>The article I read was in a Dutch newspaper, so, I&#39;m guessing not much good to you. It references an article that was published in <i>Review of General Psychology</i> September issue. I can only access abstracts of that journal. There is one article with a promising title: Mean-Level Change in Self-Esteem From Childhood Through Adulthood: Meta-Analysis of Longitudinal Studies. The abstract doesn&#39;t seem to confirm what the newspaper article said. <br><br>(Funny coincidence, I&#39;ve just returned from a lecture about how newspapers often don&#39;t properly quote research, but rather go for the big headlines).<br><br>And what can I say about Frankie?

            <p>I&#39;m not in the habit of giving bad news for the sake of it, but sometimes people need to be told no, and occasionally the first time doesn&#39;t take.

            <p>Tactful, always, and polite. However, there&#39;s no point giving criticism if it&#39;s so carefully couched so as not to hurt feelings that it never gets the message across. It&#39;s a hard balance to strike, but if we didn&#39;t keep firmly on our line of standards, we&#39;d be letting the PPC itself fall, and we care too much about this community as a whole to do that. It&#39;s still tough. I never like telling people there&#39;s something wrong with their story, and I hate denying Permission.<br><br>Around here, I generally work from the assumption that everyone cares about their writing enough to get it right, even if that means swallowing some unpleasant criticism, or even starting again from scratch. If it&#39;s any help with perspective, I&#39;ve often been told that I&#39;m being too nice.</p>

            <p>I see what you mean, but after reading the second request and the denial, I didn&#39;t want to leave Neshomeh as the only one standing up to say there were problems. It&#39;s no fun being the &#39;bad guy&#39;, and people tend to be more willing to believe that there are problems when more than one PG says it. That&#39;s what I meant by perspective - if you were a PG and you knew someone&#39;s request had to be turned down, you&#39;d have to do so. I&#39;m sure you wouldn&#39;t enjoy it. No one dies. </p>

            <p>I&#39;m stumped. I have absolutely no idea how those three words got attached to the end of my post. I certainly didn&#39;t type them, and though I sometimes have text on my clipboard that can accidentally be pasted in, it&#39;s always URLs or the like. I&#39;ve been thinking back through the whole morning, and there&#39;s no reason I would have typed that nor that it could have been copied from a webpage by accident. I haven&#39;t read those words this morning at all. So... That&#39;s worrying. Quite so. Not to sound dramatic, but I wonder if it could be another hacking attempt. <br><br>To answer your question, then - no. But you must&#39;ve guessed that.

            <p>At the end of last month, the regular PPC Posting Board, i.e. this one, was attacked by a spambot, a program that posts the same messages over and over and over. As I recall, this specific spambot kept saying it wanted candy, or something like that.<br><br>While this spam-attack was being dealt with, the Boarders all moved to the <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/Indices/241484.html"> PPC Message Board </a>. Almost immediately, Edward Wilder, one of the Boarders, started up an RP-session with the premise that the Board was a city, with the Boarders as citizens. The city was being invaded by spambots (actual robots in this RP) and the Boarders had taken shelter in a huge bunker. Some concentrated on offense, some on defense, others on providing medical attention or food, and still others were, well, pretty much helpless.<br><br>When, on September 2nd, it was reported that the spam-attack on the regular Board had been dealt with, everyone moved back to said Board, and the RP was pretty much over. Now however, as you&#39;ve seen, Galenfea and I are picking up where we left off. Look for the RP on the Message Board. It&#39;s the outrageously long thread, not too far down. And by all means, feel free to join!</p>

            <p>I think it was done once a few years ago. Done with legos, actually.... <br><br>I don&#39;t think there&#39;s anything specifically banning it. My only concern with the whole fanart thing is that there&#39;s really not much to go by in a single piece of fanart. I think it might have to be with a whole collection thereof, if it were? Like if some has an OC that they insist on putting into their art over and over again. The thing springing to mind here is the Uncanon little sister to the main character of my favorite books, that this one girl insists on putting into her art. <br><br>But yeah. I don&#39;t think there&#39;s anything stopping you from giving it a try?</p>

            <p>That is a really nice DIC mission. It was very neat and tidy! Will Sedri be in DIC for a while now?  That seems to be a very under served Department, in general, so it will be nice to be seeing missions in it.</p>

            <p>When looking for crossovers I could use for this mission, I found very few that would work well, which is a good thing, in some ways, but leaves me without a clear path. I&#39;m not sure I&#39;d like doing only DIC missions either, to be honest. I may just throw both of them in Floaters and take as many non-Sue missions as I can find that interest me. <br><br>Cheers!</p>

            <p>I don&#39;t know. Maybe they think that all love is blatent and obvious and any protests stem from social ettiquette or false denial? I really can&#39;t think of what else it could be; even if the most attractive man in the world treated me like that (and I didn&#39;t break some bones first), I&#39;d never love him.

            <p>Welcome to the ranks of the Untanglers! You lucked out--my boys have never had a mission go that smoothly. ^_~ I guess it helps that there was a minimum of the completely nonsensical, and that both agents knew what they were doing. Still, that definitely needed to be sorted out. There are some things that you just can&#39;t get away with in Tolkienverse, or Narnia, for that matter.

            <p>So I&#39;ve been told to ask this question in the direction of Keily specifically, and the Board in general. <br><br>Who would work with the younger children (Specifically in the 5-10 year old range) in the Nursery? Or, failing that, who would be the person generally in charge of the Nursery and its operations? <br><br>I&#39;ve already checked the Wiki, and all it gives is the names of those who work with the older, Just-About-Agent children. <br><br>I ask because one of the Agents I&#39;m currently working on has a seven-year-old in the Nursery, and this is one of the things that is needed to be known. <br><br>Thank you to anyone who can offer any information.</p>

            <p>But when I did a co-write with Trojie, she opened our mission with a Nursery narrative and it included a nameless agent who was chaperoning trainee Marsha. You can see that <a href="http://sedri.livejournal.com/67380.html">here</a>, if you like.<br><br>Trojie and Pads had a lot of interaction with the Nursery anyway, given that they have at least three kids there.

            <p>I&#39;ve rarely featured the Nursery in my pieces, and where I have I&#39;ve not gone into much detail. I&#39;ve always assumed that there are a lot of Nursery staff, given the number of Agents who are having children, adopting rescued children they find on missions, or leaving there as a result of MPregs or similar. I&#39;ve also just taken it as granted that the staff there (other than those already named) can be created and named by anybody who needs to feature one for whatever reason.<br><br>Basically, if you want a Nursery staff member, you&#39;re free to make one yourself, even if just for a single cameo. Hope that helps.</p>

            <p>... by <a href="http://twistedskein.webs.com/EndNursery.htm">2018</a> Elanor Wentway is working there, but I don&#39;t think she started until at least &#39;13. That story does firmly place the Nursery into the Operations Department, which means it&#39;s under the Nightshade. In the Alternate Universe <a href="http://twistedskein.webs.com/ShadesPart2.htm#chapter2">Shades of Black and Red</a> (about halfway through that chapter) the Nursery takes small children on picnics Outside - but like I say, AU as heck.<br><br>So: not a lot of useful information. <i>Nursery</i> claims that children move up in class based on understanding, not age (and it&#39;s worth noting that Elisabeth is only about five at the time under discussion, so clearly there&#39;s more than just that level and nearly-Agent), but that&#39;s still eight years in the future.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>It was the first random thing that popped into my head.

            <p>Abuse = love. How about that. Seems all my long-cherished notions about tenderness and caring were hopelessly wrong. Thank you for enlightening me, FAN-OF-FIC-GIRL64. I&#39;ll be sure to send you a <s> cursed piece of ancient Innsmouth jewelry </s> pretty, glittery trinket to express my gratitude.<br><br>Okay, now that that&#39;s off my chest...<br><br>Do you have any idea, Miah, just how funny your missions are? I particularly admire your literal interpretations. I mean, seriously, &#39;random furniture manifestation&#39;? &#39;Intensions&#39;? You&#39;re killing me over here.<br><br>The ending sequence, with the Author-wr... I mean, Author-phantom slug, however, was just plain disturbing. How sick can you get, imagining that there&#39;s one of those living pieces of snot in a man&#39;s leg? That&#39;s gross, pure and simple. (I love the way your mind works.)<br><br>That whole slug thing reminds me of Robert Heinlein&#39;s SF-novel, &#39;The Puppet Masters&#39;, in which sluglike creatures from outer space attached themselves to people&#39;s backs and mind-controlled them. Hmmm... Now I want to read the complete version of the novel, and I only have the abridged edition. Darn.</p>

            <p>...I think (for the gross comments). I&#39;m glad you liked the intensions joke. That misspelling was just too good to let it go by without comment. I&#39;ve never read Heinlein&#39;s novel, I was probably thinking of a Star Trek episode where slug-like creatures burrowed into Star Fleet officials&#39; brains and controlled them in a coup attempt. It was gross then, too.</p>

            <p>I was writing this mission about the time the first discussion of More than Sues came about. I was already having some qualms about killing them, because well, Kelok is very much my avatar in these stories, and when he said he was starting the have sympathy for Holmes that was my feeling at the time. He was still soooooo OOC, but he was not being treated by the story the way a Stu is usually treated. I was feeling a bit guilty about planning to kill him. Then the thread came up about more than killing, and I decided to try to save them. I was chatting about the problem, and we went through pretty much that whole conversation of where could the Suefluence be centered. I realized that the only thing that was consistent through the whole fic was the leg wound. After that, I just came up with the slug idea, as a way to explain why the OOC was so much more extreme than is normal in possessions.</p>

            <p>And as for the whole teleporting thing, I didn&#39;t want to make it so easy for Jasros and Lee to get back to HQ. It wouldn&#39;t provide a complex enough storyline if they just popped back to HQ. My official reason is that Jasros simply can&#39;t access the PPC.</p>

            <p>I had initially gone searching for a sue named Amelia for the lols, wanting to have a fun little mission where Lee got pissed for a Sue having her name, but then the current story arc got started and I figured it would provide a good training mission for Orion with the added benefit of having Ian distance himself from the Sue. Normally he&#39;ll be more than happy to use their proper names, but for this one? Not so much.</p>

            <p>It is our solemn duty to announce that the future of the PPC has been secured. We here at Huinesoron &amp; Kaitlyn Laboratories have discovered a method whereby the genetics of members of the PPC Board may be combined. The potential value of this finding is of course immense, and the immediate results are promising:<br><br><img src="http://i4.photobucket.com/albums/y148/Huinesoron/PPC1.jpg"><br><br>Of course the sample requires a certain amount of time to develop until he reaches his full potential as a member of the PPC, but early signs are definitely positive:<br><br><img src="http://i4.photobucket.com/albums/y148/Huinesoron/PPC2.jpg"><br><br>This seems to be his &#39;The Sues, they&#39;re coming, fly you fools&#39; face.<br><br>(Yes, it&#39;s a baby, and yes, he&#39;s really ours.

            <p>(Is it just me, or is the title bar getting shorter and shorter?)<br><br>Anyway, I wrote a fic for <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/yuri_challenge">yuri_challenge</a> on LJ; it&#39;s for <i>Avatar: The Last Airbender</i>, Azula/Katara, to the prompt &quot;With your hands marooned so freshly red/you&#39;d wrap your lips around my neck.&quot; The result is a little over 2,000 words; it is an AU. It contains graphic foreplay and cutaway-but-sex-happened bits; one of the participants is (basically) mind-controlled at the time. There isn&#39;t any actual graphic sex. It also has some minor incestuous subtext, but it isn&#39;t being portrayed as a good or healthy or otherwise OK thing. The whole story is meant to be more than a little messed-up, actually. There&#39;s also violence, and heaps upon heaps of Azula being controlling and manipulative.<br><br>I like how it came out, but of course, I need help polishing it up. I&#39;d really appreciate it if anyone would be willing to do such a thing. *cough* Also, I&#39;m working under an October 1 deadline.</p>

            <p>Here&#39;s a question popped out during the betaing of my mission.<br><br>If a first-person fic has as the POV a canon character, is a Inflatable Dummy needed, and how it will work?<br><br>I thought that the Dummy would only mimic the canon character, and is needed only to avoid agents doing so. So, my Agents originally tied and hid the Dummy to keep it from interfering with their work. (And forgot it there. It will be one of the reason that will make the Floating Hyacinct quite upset, but will have no conseguences on canon since the badfic was deleted) However, Makari said that maybe instead the canon would pop out of the dummy and another disappears at every POV change (Yes, there is also POV shift.)<br><br>What&#39;s your opinion?</p>

            <p>In one of my missions a (minor) canon character was narrating, and we used a crash dummy just like for any other mission. We exorcised it, and it turned back into a rubber cube. Pretty straightforward. <br><br>As for mimicry, I&#39;d say that&#39;re more or less the case - in a first person fic, there <i>is</i> no physical manifestation of the character in question because it&#39;s supposed to be the reader, so the dummy gives it that physical anchor instead of letting the agents be forced into it. I&#39;m not sure what would happen with a POV change, but it could probably be as simple as the dummy&#39;s plastic skin turning into proper flesh for a minute, and then flipping back. <br><br>...Was that any help? I feel like I&#39;ve missed your actual question and explained what you already know.</p>

            <p>The main problem is that the story is narrated always by a canon character (mainly by Sakura, but near the end it switches to Yukito&#39;s POV.

            <p>Um... I almost decided not to post these. I know we&#39;ve all seen lots and lots of terrible Mary Sues, but these two are so over the top, I can hardly believe it. Anyway, here goes.<br><br>*takes a deep breath*<br><br>First up, a &#39;Star Trek: The Next Generation&#39;-fanfic called <a href="http://www.trekiverse.org/archive/2000/story/tng/PicardsIllumination"> Picard&#39;s Illumination</a>, by Lorelei MacKenzie.<br>Her summary: &quot;A heartbreaking tale of love and sacrifice. Picard learns the true meaning of love, both with and without the doctor...<br>and loss onboard the Enterprise.&quot;<br><br>It&#39;s a very short fic (thank heaven for small favors), but in its 294 lines (the site counted, not me), it manages to dish out almost every single Sue-clichй in the book, except the squicky sex scene. The Sue&#39;s name, by the way, is Lorelei Cordelia MacKenzie. Please take another look and the author&#39;s name. If that doesn&#39;t make you scream, you can&#39;t possibly be awake. <i> Extreme </i> NSFB.<br>(And if you know, please tell me how it&#39;s possible to ride a horse in space.)<br><br>---<br><br>Next up, a &#39;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&#39;-fanfic called <a href="http://www.trekiverse.org/archive/2000/adult/ds9/Symphony"> Symphony</a>, by Jeane R. Noriega.<br>Her summary: &quot;When an old flame of Dr. Bashir&#39;s arrives on DS9, Julian realizes that he has never stopped loving her. Kaitlynne feels the same, but fate seems to want to keep them apart -- if it doesn&#39;t kill her first...&quot;<br><br>This fic is one hell of a lot worse than the first. For one thing, it is looooong. You feel like decapitating the Sue about five seconds after she first appears, but this fic just. Keeps. Dragging. On.<br><br>Furthermore, Kaitlynne Marcella Taylor is the epitome of the Mary Sue, and the one big sex scene is ubersquickful.<br><br>You have been warned.<br><br>NSFB, very NSFW.</p>

            <p>The possibility that there exist Suethors whose sense of reality is so warped that they think this is good writing, is simply too horrible to contemplate.<br><br>On analysis, though, it seems quite possible that s/he <i> is</i> a troll. After all, seriously, rusty wooden doors, horses in space, suicide with an eyelash, hiccups-o&#39;-distress? Bit much.<br>Still, I wish trolls would just admit what they are. The uncertainty kills.<br><br>As for the second author, she&#39;s most likely not a troll. This fic takes itself too seriously to be intentional badfic. I for one can&#39;t see through the cracks, so to speak. What do <i> you</i> think?</p>

            <p>Well, their first published mission anyway. We&#39;ve done three missions for them and we&#39;re working on a fourth; we just felt like doing that bit of backstory as well. I don&#39;t know if we&#39;ll do their chronological first mission or not, particularly since the mission in Suebusters takes place - again, speaking chronologically - not terribly long after that interlude. Sorry if I misunderstood, but thanks for the comment.</p>

            <p>A couple times now in the PPC chat, people have made references to high school and even middle school, and when I&#39;ve asked with trepidation how old people are, they&#39;ve all been younger than 18.<br><br>Now, Laburnum mentioned recently that she&#39;d celebrated her 21st birthday. I was terribly relieved by this, and commented to that effect on her LJ, telling the story of how I feel old in PPC Chat. Someone else responded saying that they&#39;d gotten the impression that there were a lot of older folks on the boards. Then I just saw a post about someone having a child, which I assume/hope means adulthood age. ;)<br><br>So... What is the average age on the PPC board? I&#39;m twenty-four. Twenty-four is not old. Please reassure me of this? </p>

            <p>So in some ways, I&#39;m an old dame of the Board. In others, I&#39;m a youngster. *dramatic sigh* Ever the middle child . . . <br><br>For what it&#39;s worth, age is even harder to determine on boards like this; an attention to grammar, spelling, and story construction can create a maturity of communication that doesn&#39;t always correspond with the age we associate with said maturity. I remember being a fourteen-year-old roleplayer back on a dinky little Tripod site, having guys assume I was in my twenties. It&#39;s amazing what the ability to communicate will do for ya. :D</p>

            <p>Twenty-four is notnotnotnotnotnotnotnotnotnotnot old. Not. I may not have stressed that enough, but I can say I tried very hard. However, I think that as someone of average height may be compelled to think themselves short among people who just happen to be taller, someone who is not <i>old</i> may think otherwise when among a younger crowd. Perspective is funny like that.<br><br>Am I telling you to spend time with those older than yourself? Your choice. I think I was just catching on to the reassuring thing. Maybe I actually made sense. =D</p>

            <p>You&#39;re not old. I&#39;m about the same as you are, and Pads - who just left - is older. So&#39;s Trojie, who&#39;s technically still here. The average age is under twenty, I think, or just at. I can&#39;t remember where July&#39;s survey results are, but at the time it was taken, our oldest member was thirty-two, I think, and nineteen different people were aged twenty or above. So don&#39;t worry :)</p>

            <p>I frequently feel old in chat, but then I think I may be the second oldest current/active member. I just turned thirty-one, but I think my actual age has less to do with feeling old there than the fact that I have a lot less internet experience than a lot of the younger users.  Sometimes in chat I get flashes of how my Granny must feel when confronted with such hi-tech objects as universal remotes and programmable DVRs. Plus, I started kids rather early (I have three boys ranging in age from 10 1/2 to 2), so I am at a lot different stage of life than most here seem to be, which also makes me feel old.<br><br>I&#39;m kind of glad that I&#39;m not the only one that feels like that sometimes. All that said, I believe the survey July did earlier this year put the average age at almost twenty-one. I don&#39;t remember if it mentioned the mode age. </p>

            <p>Being second oldest. At least, I&#39;m older than you. There were some people older than me, but I haven&#39;t seen them in ages.<br><br>Old is relative. A few years ago, my two office roommates who are both four years younger than me, were having a kid or buying a house and getting married, and I thought they were doing these I associate with people much older (read mature) than me. Perhaps this is because, as my mother says: I still live like a student. Though that might have been because I still had all the same furniture I had when I was a student. (If it ain&#39;t broken why replace it.)<br><br>On the other hand, I have to think about how old I am, if anyone asks, because the age that I say spontaneously lies a few years below that. Then again, people who try to guess my age always guess five years younger, and I don&#39;t think they are trying to be polite. </p>
