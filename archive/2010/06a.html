            <p>When I&#39;m reading PPC missions and looking up multiple bad fics, I&#39;m starting to notice a possible motive to why Mary Sues are twisting canon. The Scientific Theory of Suvian Origins may have established the &quot;what&quot; of Mary Sue but there&#39;s a missing vital piece of information, the &quot;why&quot; and their motives.<br><br> My guess is that Mary Sues are incomplete beings who can&#39;t self-substain themselves unlike canon characters. They lacked a vital part that makes anyone canon, gifted by authors. Canon is like a heart for a body to pump energy to survive. Canon is the essence of life and existence, I called this the &quot;canon factor&quot;.<br><br> Mary Sues lacked the canon factor because their creators, the Suethors, can&#39;t publish their fics officially due to copyrights, thus they are posted as fanfiction. Without the canon factor, they slowly starve and if not fed, they die. This can only be slowed down just by being acknowledged by the Suthor herself but that won&#39;t be enough to ensure the sue&#39;s survival. Even with powers and/or the perfection, they are weak as characters for canon because canonical works rejects them because their involvement in most continua would harm their figurative structure as established universes. <br><br> The main method of surviving is to feed on canon energy. Usually, that energy can&#39;t bleed out by normal means but there&#39;s multiple methods to do that, interfere and/or twist canon through meddling canon affairs. Their acts of unholy uncanonized crimes usually affects the inhabitants, usually main characters but that also effects locations too. Ergo, canon energy bleeds off from the victims and the sue absorbs the energy, ensuring her survival in a disguise of a canon character. If the sue&#39;s powerful, she needs more energy. Should this be left untouched, the results would be catastrophic such as becoming a dry husk or a twisted mockery of itself or worse, cease to exist. <br><br>  As for slash fics without Mary Sues, they are there alright but comes in a different form. Two sub-species called the author-wraith and the other is a clone called a Replacement Sue. Although they are different, the methods are the same. The victim of these monsters are &quot;popular&quot; characters, usually handsome or cute ones, beings with plenty of canon energy, enough to substain a canon location. Their ways are through pseudo affection and sex. Having sex with a sue is a very bad idea because no matter the gender, it drains the victim&#39;s energy quickly than the orgasms. These two are extremely dangerous so it is best is exorcisms for author-wraiths and assassinations for replacements.<br><br>  To remedy these problems, the PPC has to do their jobs in order keep continua alive and healthy. Once the sue has been killed, the canon energy they stole return to their rightful owners as if they never step foot there in the first place.<br><br>This is one of many parts of this theory. I will write more about this in deeper topics such as the bond between Sues and Suethors. </p>

            <p>I like this place already, although I don&#39;t entirely agree. My take on the classic &#39;pink&#39; Mary-Sue is this: Mary-Sues are written by daydreamers and people that fantasize that are stupid enough to put pointless fantasies online for the world to see. This is inexcusable- I may enjoy drawing a dress with silver embroidery, but I will not punish my readers with a few paragraphs on the dress. </p>

            <p>Of course the ACMSES has a different definition of Sue than the PPC, but I wanted to contribute.<br><br>The Mary Sue wants to fix something. The idea is that the Sue will do anything, anything at all, to ensure that the author&#39;s ideal of a perfect version of the fandom is achieved.

            <p>Seems to me like the Sue has her author fooled, too. The author thinks s/he&#39;s getting to spend time with his/her favorite canon, or getting to &quot;fix&quot; the canon so it&#39;s &quot;better&quot;; but the Sue only takes advantage of the author&#39;s ability to create and change worlds to insert herself into a canon.<br><br>That would explain why the PPC doesn&#39;t just kill Suethors; they&#39;re only guilty of gullibility and inexperience, not malevolent intent.<br><br>If the Sue is a natural phenomenon, a creature that&#39;s evolved to take advantage of plot holes, it makes sense that she&#39;d be able to influence authors. Authors, after all, can create those plot holes; and bad authors are most vulnerable because they create a whole lot of plot holes and don&#39;t close them; and Sues can manipulate plot holes.<br><br>If a Sue latches onto a plot hole in a new canon, she often turned into a Canon Sue, incorporated into the canon itself.</p>

            <p>Theories are fun. And this is a good theory. I like it.<br><br>Perhaps Sues also gain some energy by being acknowledged by others? Not only the Suethor, but hapless readers of fanfiction? Reviewers and the like?<br><br>Or perhaps Sues are autonomous entities--maybe they can exist without authors, but must possess them in order to invade canon. It might not be the Suethors&#39; faults after all. On the other hand, we still need to attack the abominable creatures that are Sue.<br><br>One of the most pleasing experiences of my life was to persuade a Suethor that her character was, in fact, a Sue, and had horribly mucked with canon besides. She took it down, and I haven&#39;t checked since, but she said she was rewriting it to improve. Small wonders, hey?</p>

            <p>As I said before, sues usually have short lives and suethors are like life support systems for their creations and also about reformed sues.<br><br>  In canon, authors grant life to their creations but suethors create but unable to give the sues good characterization nor a normal life span. These kind of flaws made the sues suffer. Worse, the bond can be broken if the suethor disowned the sue and/or never acknowledged as her creation. The amount of glitter in her body is a hint of how strong the bond is. While this sounds good at first but the drawbacks overweight the benefits. Broken powerful bonds is lethal to the sue, usually death or force her into a comatose state. The bond is double edged sword for sues.<br><br>  As for reformed sues, the bond is severed from the suethor which should make them really weak. The ones with strong levels of glitter are impossible since they are too much of a hassle to handle. Sues can be reformed into normal beings even without having rely on the bond. They just have receive treatments but there&#39;s one problem, glitter is like their blood so trying to remove it could be fatal until medical research provided us a way to cure them of their suedom. </p>

            <p>Adding this level of detail to what sues are in the PPC canon are is just asking to be too difficult to implement to all the various PPCers. <br><br>My suggestion is that you make one of your agents have alot of pet theories on what sues are, and just sprinkle these speculations into his dialogue. That way they /may/ be true, but other agents are free to interpret however they like. </p>

            <p>Just because it&#39;s too complicated to fit into some stories, doesn&#39;t mean it couldn&#39;t be right. Or true. Whatever. I think that it could be used but not concretely added to necessary fanon. Necessary fanon is the Sunflower Official, not theories. Necessary fanon might not even be the Reorganisation, if you just wanted to do a normal, mission-following fic.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m with you and VixenMage, I think. It&#39;s fun to think this stuff up, but it doesn&#39;t really fit with the PPC&#39;s set-up, which is that Sues are the creations of authors who write fanfiction, the Words of which interfere with the Words of canon, thus redefining the canon universe in an undesirable, disruptive way. All the PPC acknowledges that Sues come from bad fanfiction and that those badfics have authors; it doesn&#39;t really leave room for Sues as independent organisms with a unique evolution and biology.<br><br>Even the essays that Trojie and Crystal wrote don&#39;t really work for me for that reason, even though it is interesting to read them.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>We have lots of conspiracy theories floating around the wiki, and I suppose having a &quot;suvian parasite creature&quot; theory that some agents hold to is ok. Doesn&#39;t make it official PPC canon, but given the craziness and paranoia of half of HQ, a suvian parasite theory seems like something that could get a following amongst some agents.<br><br>Elcalion  </p>

            <p>Your basic PPC canon states that Mary Sues are created by authors and destroy/distort canon; when they&#39;re killed the distortions vanish. That describes things. Like Newton&#39;s law of gravitation--it describes what happens, but not the &quot;why&quot;.<br><br>Along comes Einstein and figures out part of the &quot;why&quot;. Newton&#39;s laws still apply in all but the most extreme of circumstances; and most engineers (barring a few specialized fields) never need to use relativity to figure out their problems. Einstein&#39;s additions to physics are like the ideas we&#39;re tossing around about the &quot;why&quot; of Mary Sues--impractical for most circumstances, where you just need to know the basic canon; but cool to think about, especially if you want to define the universe (or, in this case, multiverse) precisely.<br><br>Of course, there were multiple theories around the time that Einstein was figuring stuff out; and it wasn&#39;t proved by experiment for some time. It makes sense that we&#39;d have multiple theories here, at least until one of the DMSE&amp;R folks publishes some research on the problem. And I for one like speculating. It&#39;s fun. (&#39;Course, I&#39;m also the one with Elf genealogies in my head from my LotR phase...)<br><br>There are already a couple of theories about Mary Sues and the multiverse on the wiki; I&#39;d like to have this one put up as well once everybody&#39;s got a chance to put in their ideas.</p>

            <p>I find this idea pretty good, it completely explains non canon sues. However, Canon Sues are not quite the same problem - they ARE actually canon, so they are only resembling a Sue in behaviour, but do not share the same mechanics of energy stealing. In easy words, Canon Sues do not feed on canon energy, because they are in canon.</p>

            <p>And they aren&#39;t. There&#39;s not enough characterization to make them sentient; just a bunch of weird Sueperpowers tacked to a cardboard character.

            <p>Still, if you want to look at it seriously, the ethics are dicey.

I prefer to think of them as creations of Words - just like everything else in a Word World - rather than a species with biological needs.

            <p>If you interpret the entire PPCverse as words, then everyone ends up seeming controlled by them and... You know where I&#39;m going with this... Soon, you end up with not a fictional universe at all but just a blob of... words...<br><br>And that isn&#39;t fun, at least to me. In my opinion, it&#39;s more interesting if you take the two concepts and mix them together, so the inhabitants of the PPCverse are biological, yet the words are such an integral part of them that the two are inseparable. If the body dies, the words are rendered inert, having lost their meaning. Likewise, if the words are somehow destroyed, the body ceases to function, the words acting like a life support system for the character.<br><br>Sues and Author-wraiths consist almost entirely of words, and are thus far less capable of acting independently from them. They&#39;re just puppets to act out the words that make them up, mindlessly following orders until something changes, in which it will feebly try to adapt (and fail).<br><br>...I don&#39;t know... I&#39;m probably not onto anything at all, I&#39;m just rambling on again out of sheer boredom. *hides*<br><br></p>

            <p>Though I like the part where it says Sues are feeding on canon characters, I don&#39;t agree that Sues need to feed on canon characters because their authors can&#39;t publish their work officially. There&#39;s plenty of (officially) published fiction where there are Sues in the story. </p>

            <p>I was going through my stash of downloaded &#39;fics recently, and I came across the first ever H/D slashfic I ever read. For nostalgia&#39;s sake, I started skimming it, and realized very quickly that these days it was something I would much rather PPC than read. However, when I went looking for it online, all I found was a note from the author saying that she had taken it down and moved on. I know deleted &#39;fics have been PPCed before, but I also seem to recall an ethical note stating that it&#39;s in bad taste to PPC stories whose authors understood how bad they were. <br><br>I had a couple thoughts about how to deal with it, the main one being the author-wraith exorcising herself and knocking sense into the canons on her own. It&#39;s been done with assassinations, and I think I could make it work for an exorcism. Alternatively, I could just do a deleted-story drama, much like the one found in the JAAKSONS, among others, and ignore the exorcism altogether. My first inclination is for the first, but I could manage either.<br><br>What do the rest of you think about the ethics of this situation? Should I go for it at all, or should I just look around for another H/D badfic? (It&#39;s not like there&#39;s any lack of them. Heck, I&#39;ve written several myself...)<br><br>(For the record, the mission coming from this probably won&#39;t be out for a while. I&#39;m planning a story-arc for Sarah and Elaina at the moment, so we have a couple to go before getting here, but oh well. It&#39;s nice to plan ahead.)<br><br>--anamia</p>

            <p>Definitely, I think she gets a break if she&#39;s learned from her mistakes. On the other hand, it occurred to me that if she knew it was bad, she might enjoy seeing it mocked.

            <p>True, we try to focus on the &#39;fic, not the author, but if an author has taken their work down - particularly if they did so because they know it&#39;s bad - it&#39;s best to respect that. Besides, from an in-world point-of-view, the fanfic is no longer around to wreck havoc on canon, so there&#39;s no need to PPC it anyway ;)<br><br>If there are aspects of it so dreadful that you feel you can&#39;t let it go, what about having your agents grumble about it in the past tense, as though it were a mission they once did in the non-narrative time before you started writing them? Or have them moan about it being the first such badfic they read and how it traumatised them? In that case they could outright state that the author later took it down, and even complain that they&#39;d have liked to PPC it themselves - remember, the &#39;lives&#39; of our avatar agents tend to follow &#39;real life&#39;, if in a bizzare, twisted fashion.<br><br>But even if not, I wouldn&#39;t PPC it. There&#39;s nothing stopping you, if you&#39;re determined, but since you asked...</p>

            <p>My understanding about the PPC is that it is less author specific (since we don&#39;t link the original author the story, and don&#39;t ever particularly plan for the original author to find missions) and more about generally sporking particularly bad works. From that position, the only criteria for fics would be ones that would be /fun/ to do missions for. <br><br>That said, if the author disliked the work enough to delete it (I actually would have left a bad fic up to just to show how far I&#39;ve come) they would probably be upset that someone else put it back up, in whatever form. </p>

            <p>I&#39;ve been addicted to Advance Wars: Dual Strike for weeks now, which was a resurgence of an earlier addiction to the earlier two games.  As I only started playing this most recent game after my exposure to the Fan Fiction community (the story being the poorest of the three, leaving an unlikely and unsatisfactory end for my tastes), I was drawn to start writing a fun light hearted story that plays with the darker side of one of the hero characters, Sonja. <br><br>The first chapter of the story can be found at  <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6035726/1/Enhanced_Vision"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6035726/1/Enhanced_Vision">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6035726/1/Enhanced_Vision</a></a> if you are interested.  I&#39;ll try to keep it updating at a fairly regular pace. Comments (I have a large ego to feed) and criticism (I have very thick skin) are welcome. <br><br>I tried to make it a fun read even for people that aren&#39;t as familiar with the canon, but obviously people who have played the games will enjoy it more. </p>

            <p>I asked about this on the Unclaimed Badfic discussion page the other day, but it ended up getting buried in the Activity Feed. Should there be a new category on the Unclaimed/Claimed/Killed Badfic pages for internet media?<br><br>I&#39;m asking because I found a grotty little badfic set in the Red vs Blue universe, which you can read at <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4938785/1/Welcome_to_Blood_Gulch"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4938785/1/Welcome_to_Blood_Gulch">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4938785/1/Welcome_to_Blood_Gulch</a></a> if you really want to. For those of you who don&#39;t know, Red vs. Blue is a machinima series that uses the Halo video game engine as its medium. I&#39;d like to claim it, but I have no idea where to put it. I don&#39;t want to put it in Halo because it&#39;s not officially part of the Halo canon.<br><br>Does anyone have any thoughts?</p>

            <p>Personally, I thought it would be it&#39;s own canon but a subcanpn makes more sense. Also, maybe I&#39;m thinking too much about this, but how is one supposed to nueralyze someone if they&#39;re wearing a helmet?</p>

            <p>We all get angry at badfic. We gawp at what has happened to our beloved canon, and realize that the author of such badfic has little respect for the soul of the material and just wanted to play around with it. Which, in and of itself, is okay, as long as we learn from it. That&#39;s how most of us started writing. (I myself am guilty of a Zelda/Yu-Gi-Oh! crossover &#39;Sue, the only redeeming feature of which is that I never let it out of my hard drive.)<br><br>But when the story in question is published, piggybacking on a deceased author&#39;s body of work, and licensed by the estate (or the copyright has run out), is it still &quot;okay&quot; to get angry about &quot;damage&quot; done to the canon? As the new story is licensed and published, it counts as canon (so far as I understand the PPC&#39;s rules) - but what if it violates everything the original canon stood for? What if it contradicts key information that the original author wrote (and cannot correct it due to Author Existence Failure)? What if beloved characters are killed off with no real reason? What if a main character&#39;s age is suddenly changed (or disregarded)? Or his backstory? Or his entire personality?<br><br>What if the &quot;continuation&quot; is really a different series with this character&#39;s/universe&#39;s name slapped onto it like a cheap, off-brand Post-it note?<br><br>Is &quot;badfic rage&quot; justified in such a case? Does it even technically count as canon if there are such blatant character/&#39;verse replacements?<br><br><a href="http://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2003/10/15/">This Penny Arcade comic</a> pretty much sums up the phenomenon to which I refer. There&#39;s a series very close to my heart that is getting this treatment. A new book in the continuations just came out, and I managed to read the inside dustjacket cover without throwing it across the bookstore. Barely. It shreds what little is left of the canon at this point (after far more continuation books published than in the original series). Am I right to be angry, or do I just have issues?</p>

            <p>Ahhh... Stupid after-series. With some, it&#39;s not so bad, but with popular series and classics, it can get pretty bad.<br><br>Curiously enough, LOTR has never gotten that treatment. Probably because LOTR practically defines fantasy. You just can&#39;t do anything more. With Dune, though, it just went way too far, and don&#39;t even get me started on Star Wars. Prequels, sequels, alternate-historequels... Ugh. Little more than published badfic. I&#39;m surprised there aren&#39;t lame AUs and Bad Slash books.<br><br>I agree with what Cliever said; they&#39;re a divergent canon that includes the original but is not included in the original. Unless they&#39;re just horribly, disgustingly lame--then they&#39;re in a category all their own, specifically for despising. Like the later Dune spinoffs. And most of the Star Wars spinoffs.</p>

            <p>Specifically with the upcoming Xcom FPS, which is supposedly somehow connected to the X-com top-down turn based isometric squad tactical game. I think what irritates me most is that it is inexplicably set in the 1960&#39;s with the main character being an FBI agent. Mostly because I see no possible reason for that change.</p>

            <p>The general consensus was that if they&#39;re published, they&#39;re canon, but it&#39;s a sort of splinter canon where it might include the originals but the originals don&#39;t include it.<br><br>Basically, unless the badfic specifically includes the unofficial sequel, it can be safely disregarded for the consideration of missions. For instance, a &#39;Love Never Dies&#39; badfic must consider &#39;The Phantom of the Opera,&#39; but a &#39;Phantom of the Opera&#39; badfic does not necessarily include &#39;Love Never Dies.&#39;</p>

            <p>I&#39;d say it&#39;s pretty much up to each individual fan what&#39;s part of canon and what isn&#39;t.  What troubles me personally is Sherlock Holmes published fiction.  A lot of authors seem to use Holmes&#39; name as a crutch to get their borderline fanfiction published, and I don&#39;t feel that&#39;s appropriate.<br><br>I once read a Holmes novel entitled &quot;The Seven Percent Solution.&quot;  I went in assuming that was a reference to the eventual solution to the crime, but it was actually referring to Holmes&#39; frequent use of a 7% mixture of cocaine in water.  The novel is a crossover with real-life Sigmund Freud, who psychoanalyzes Holmes (who is a worse addict than he ever was in the original stories) to uncover the mommy issues that keep him a bachelor and led to his substance dependencies.  My real problem with the novel is that it implies Moriarty, the admittedly never-developed villain of the Holmes-verse, to be a common math professor; Holmes has subconsciously imagined all his criminal activities, probably because Moriarty was romantically involved with Holmes&#39; mother or something.  Freud eventually convinces Holmes to seek treatment for his drug use, prompting Holmes to ask Watson to publish a false account of his death temporarily to avoid attention (which is implied to be &quot;The Adventure of the Final Problem&quot;).<br><br>&quot;The Seven-Per-Cent Solution&quot; annoyed me because it basically sought to undo part of the established Holmes canon (and because Freud, whose beliefs I hate vehemently, was in it, but that&#39;s not important right now).  On the other hand, I&#39;ve also read another piece of published Holmes literature called &quot;The Einstein Paradox,&quot; which used the vehicle of Holmes (and Professor Challenger, another Doyle character) solving mysteries as usual as a backdrop for explaining quantum physics mechanics.  Despite the educational intent of this book (which was even used as a textbook for my high school&#39;s AP Physics class), I absolutely loved reading it, because it remained true to the main canon, and really did read remarkably like an original Holmes story.  (I highly recommend it to any Sherlock Holmes fans; the author is Colin Bruce.)<br><br>So to finally get around to the heart of this discussion, this extra published fiction is very similar to fanfiction: sometimes, it&#39;s good, and we enjoy it becomes it fits well with the canon; other times, it&#39;s bad, and makes us cringe because it doesn&#39;t jive well with the parts of the canon we remember and love.  In those latter cases, we just have to accept that those publications do exist, but that we can choose to ignore them.  I don&#39;t think it&#39;s even worth getting angry about, because, as we, of all people, know, there will always be bad writing.  We just have to keep ourselves busy with the good stuff.<br><br>My apologies for the long rant.</p>

            <p>that&#39;s a really good example. If &quot;The Seven Percent Solution&quot; was a fanfiction, it would have been PPCed for sure. But it was published, and now? Canon or non canon? I think it&#39;s not canon, because it COMPLETELY destroys canon.</p>

            <p>Saying that rage isn&#39;t justified would be like telling me I&#39;m not allowed to be angry about environmental damage just because people enjoy driving cars. <br><br>Things like <i>Lost in Austen</i> and <i>Pride and Prejudice and Zombies</i> make me furious, and half the fandom discussions nowadays seem to be about whether new additions to canon are &#39;official&#39; or otherwise good enough. Everyone has their own opinion, and I don&#39;t see why something truly upsetting should be suppressed. Of course you have the right to be angry.</p>

            <p>Pride and Prejudice and Zombies had the potential to be funny. Most of those things do. I just wish the authors would show a bit more creativity about it--a lot of the lines sounded like they were quoted directly from the book. It&#39;s like the minor badfic genre-- &quot;I&#39;m too lazy to make my own plot, so I&#39;ll just write the canon in story form.&quot; Only found in visual-media genres, especially manga and anime.</p>

            <p>Though, I admit, I do kind of like the Zombies. It&#39;s nicely random and sort of well done. Fun, at least. But yeah, not canon. <br><br>As for being angry, the only difference between badfic and bad profic is that one is legal and one is questionable. I don&#39;t see why you shouldn&#39;t be able to exhibit the same response. There&#39;s also, in my opinion, a difference between spin offs and official continuations. Pride and Prejudice spin offs/sequels are probably not canon because they weren&#39;t made with Jane Austen&#39;s knowledge and/or approval. The new Dr. Who, on the other hand, is accepted as canon, mostly, because it was made, as far as I know, with permission and/or knowledge of the original creators, or at least owners.<br><br>--anamia</p>

            <p>...it depends how bad the story is. I mean, in Doctor Who, a lot of people got mad at the eighth Doctor TV movie and don&#39;t count it as canon because they said a lot of things that contradict established canon. But a lot of people do count it, and think it was good.<br><br>I suppose it is justified if the characters are really OOC, i.e if it were fanfic, we would class it as Bleepfic-or-even-worse. That way, regardless of canonicity (is that a word?) it is still bad because the author clearly knows nothing about/disrespects that particular canon. Also, they must have a reaction with more than just you if they are as bad as you say, so a section of the fandom do not like it or indeed class it as canon.<br></p>

            <p>I will admit I raeg fireballs at certain profics. I flat out gave up on the Star Wars books after Barbara Hambly&#39;s... thing and the absolute crap R. A. Salvatore pulled from his a**. I refuse to touch anything beyond the original Dune books (Kevin J. Anderson seems to be one of those who pops up in EUs that suck). I once read a sequel to Pride and Prejudice that I&#39;m sure would make Austen spin in her grave. <br><br>I don&#39;t consider profics as part of the canon. I could say I would if the author/creator has given approval to someone else continuing his/her works, but some of the time that creator is dead and their works get nasty things done to them for the sake of making money. <br><br>The PPC as a whole may consider them canon, but I&#39;m not wasting any more of my money or time on crap churned out by the likes of Kevin J. Anderson, Dave Wolverton, etc. (Although, I might consider reading William Shatner&#39;s Star Trek novels just for the amusement. XD)<br><br>Long story short, I totally understand the rage. It makes me feel better to ignore the existance of works that defile canon. -_-</p>

            <p>They scare me. I once read a &quot;sequel&quot; to Huckleberry Finn that I was hard-pressed not to return to the library in tatters.<br><br>This review says it all:<br><a href="http://www.amazon.com/review/R3286RI6SVGEAK/ref=cm_cr_rdp_perm"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/review/R3286RI6SVGEAK/ref=cm_cr_rdp_perm">http://www.amazon.com/review/R3286RI6SVGEAK/ref=cm_cr_rdp_perm</a></a><br><br>I wonder where the prohibition on published adaptations ends. Can you count a school play written by the sixth-grade music teacher? How about the high school drama teacher? What if fanfiction is published in a school newspaper? What if it&#39;s a college newspaper? A nationally-sold fanfiction magazine?<br><br>Actually, come to think of it, adaptations seem to be fair game for the PPC under all of what I know (which could be the problem because I don&#39;t know nearly enough). Can someone explain that to me?</p>

            <p>Basically, the rumor is that Anakin was supposed to swap roles with Jacen, and then George Lucas decided that idea was a stupid idea. It does explain a lot about the structuring of the character arcs prior to Anakin&#39;s death. Dunno if there is any evidence to back it up, though.</p>

            <p>Personally, if there&#39;s a professional fanfiction &#39;sequel&#39; or &#39;prequel&#39; that is desecrates all the ideas its parent canon stood for, or is vastly inferior to its parent canon, I can simply choose not to count it as canon.

For example, the truly godawful TV series &quot;Lost in Austen&quot; reads exactly like a bad Mary Suefic, with Amanda Price screwing up all the events of Pride and Prejudice and making Darcy and Bingley fall for her. Now, if the TV series had had Amanda Price come into the story <i>after</i> the events of the book, she would be a lot easier to ignore. But, even though a professionally written fic is technically its own canon, I will still call it canon-mangling and get irritated if it messes with things in medias res.<br><br>~Araeph</p>

            <p>Feel free to dismiss my idle chatter as the merely the mumblings of someone who &#39;doesn&#39;t  get&#39; fandom.  But from my perspective, nothing says that you, personally, have to accept new &#39;licensed&#39; works as canon.  <br><br>Alot of people were angered at the latest Star Trek movie.  I honestly don&#39;t understand why.  It was a fun action flick - nothing more, nothing less.  There is no reason that it&#39;s existence means you /have/ to accept it as the new star trek universe.  If The Next Generation is your favorite show, nothing is forcing you from saying that it&#39;s successors, or the plethora of bad movies after it were merely alternate universes.  Even better, just keep in mind that fiction that is written doesn&#39;t /actually/ become reality, and just realize that if a book or movie is made that is &#39;official&#39; doesn&#39;t mean you are tied to worshipping it. <br><br>Regardless, getting angry doesn&#39;t work. </p>

            <p>If it&#39;s published, it&#39;s Canon. If it contradicts what happened in previous versions, it makes its own canon. For example, movieverse LotR didn&#39; overwrite bookverse LotR. Exactly what counts as contradiction has never been established, to my knowledge. In TOS, I believe the movieverse/bookverse dichotomy was explained before the Two Towers movie launched, so draw from that what conclusions you will. Obviously, even relatively minor differences in events will split a Canon, but I don&#39;t think how far characters or themes need to be bent before splitting has ever been explored. In general, at least, we judge a fic by the setting it claims - if a Suefic is running around in Reboot!Trek, we&#39;ll charge and kill her for offences against Reboot!Trek.<br><br>(Speaking of which, I think it was a rather elegant solution to the problem.)</p>

            <p>That&#39;s an interesting question - one that I am obviously not qualified to answer, but I will discuss anyway because I love to see myself type.<br><br>Canon&#39;s are usually based on specific authors, but obviously multi-author canon&#39;s exist (hence Star Trek).  Many times contradictory factors come into being in the same canon (sometimes even by the same author).  How does the PPC usually handle these?<br><br>I think what&#39;ll have to happen is that those canons really are affected by the new authors - The PPC just has to accept the canon as having developed many &#39;naturally occuring&#39; plotholes, making the canon unstable. <br><br>Another possibility is that alternate canons are created.  I&#39;m pretty sure there is precedence for that. </p>

            <p>Canons with multiple authors tend to have little contradictions. I&#39;m thinking this probably connects with multiverse theory--that a story is not just what *is*, but also what *could be*; and that both versions exist simultaneously as slightly-alternate universes. Each continuum isn&#39;t just made of one universe, but of many universes, which is why AU fics still have to be PPC&#39;d.<br><br>Adaptations far enough away from the original will create their own continua, though. </p>

            <p>I can give you two examples.<br><br><i>Star Trek</i> seems a good place to start. Generally, if it&#39;s canon somewhere, you have to acknowledge that. If someone&#39;s writing a <i>Voyager</i> fanfic and uses a technobable fact only mentioned in DS9, then it&#39;s not chargable, even if it doesn&#39;t make sense. If someone writing that same fanfic used a technobable fact from DS9 that was actively contradicted by something in Voyager, then it gets trickier; my best advice there is to be generous, and not charnge the author for nitpicks when they may have actively chosen to take one version of canon over another, since it&#39;s all one big mesh with no dominant &#39;truth&#39;. <br><br>(When I write for <i>Star Trek</i>, I look for what makes sense, starting with the series (or even the specific episode) that&#39;s most relevant for the fic, and then searching around for more information. Frankly speaking, when it contradicts, I&#39;ll take the &#39;fact&#39; that works best for me. There&#39;s no other practical way to do it.)<br><br><br>On the other hand, when there are more clear-cut &#39;verses - such as the four-way &#39;split between <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Wicked">L Frank Baum&#39;s original Oz books, the 1939 movie with Judy Garland, Gregory Maguire&#39;s out-of-copyright novel Wicked, and the stage musical adaptation of Wicked</a>. When PPCing fics for any of the four, I have to work out which &#39;verse it&#39;s intended to be set in (which usually isn&#39;t hard), but if they cross-exchange facts, especially if they try to blend two or more into a single, logical &#39;verse, it&#39;s not chargable, as far as I know. Only blatant lack of logic or internal contradictions can be charged in those circumstances.<br><br>Or so I think. Discussion, anyone?</p>

            <p>But I certainly RAGE at plenty of adaptations of books that I love (pause to glare at Peter Jackson), so I would say that just because something is profic not fanfic doesn&#39;t mean that you can&#39;t rage at how it destroyed canon.<br><br>I think the closest I&#39;ve come to your situation is when I heard about ALW&#39;s sequel for <i>The Phantom of the Opera</i>, which sounded absolutely horrible.  But I was always more a fan of the book than the musical anyway.  And I was disappointed by some of the recent <i>Star Wars</i> novels, but that&#39;s different too.  (At least, I think it is.)</p>

            <p>Glad you liked it; it&#39;s always nice to know people enjoy our stuff.<br><br>And thanks for the note, as well. I think the dragging is a leftover from the rewrite we had to do - we left in as much of the original as we could, but evidently that wasn&#39;t the greatest move.

            <p>No problem, I already have all I need. A Beretta 92 and a knife should be enough for most Sues in modern settings.<br><br>A little question I didn&#39;t found answer on the Wiki. Who writes PPC&#39;s spinoffs is allowed to make new gadgets? Because I had an idea for a funny new one.<br>It&#39;s called Random Sue Execution Gun (RSEG). A small pistol that when aimed at a Sue transforms itself into a single-use very different weapon, mostly illogical ones (A non-functional rifle with a giant sue-smashing hammer hinged to it, for example). And very often, being PPC tecnology, useless/self destructing ones. As a rubber ducky gun.</p>

            <p>Once, I had the vision of a massive crossover.  it would combine many canons and many characters: LotR, Discworld, Gargoyles, Weekenders, an obscure MTV series called UnderGRADS among others.<br><br>It collapsed on top of me and broke 80% of my bones.<br><br>I got better.<br><br>But I come to donate a plausible Idea from the Discworld portion of the story.  I had envisioned a grand host of  some tens of thousands genetically modified, extra-dimensional Quarrymen berserks storming Ankh&#39;s Least Gate.<br><br>They would have had 2 objectives:<br><br>-attack the Unseen university and destroy it in revenge (for an affront I never got around to finish writing)<br>-slaughter everything in their path<br><br>Of course, in the defense of the city, I imagined several ingenious devices courtesy of Leonard of Quirm.  The most useful of these is what I gift to the ages:  morph-able armor for your classic bimorphic werewolf.  In theory, it would take advantage of an intricate system of folding and shifting lamellar, sliding attachment points for ringmail and extensive use of either mithril, titanium or some disc-native equivalent.<br><br>To be absolutely honest, I think ol&#39; Lenny had it better planned out than I did.

            <p>Hellooo~<br><br>I like my parrots. I am named after a parrot. The parrot after which I am named is very pretty and (in my experience) generally sweet-tempered, and I luffle them and want one for a pet. Also they are lovely and soft and fluffy and warm... ~squee~<br><br>Actually, the same goes for almost all birds, including the ones that would gladly bite your face off if you tried to snuggle them. (I&#39;d do it anyway. Eyes are overrated, and it&#39;s not like mine are good for much anyway. 20/800 vision sucks.)<br><br>Anyway. I like fantasy, sci-fi and manga. I like Naomi Novik&#39;s Temeraire series (imagine the British RAF; give them dragons. That kind of awesome) among many, many others; but I&#39;ve been getting back into Temeraire recently, so that&#39; the first one that comes to mind. Also LOTR, Isaac Asimov, the Abhorsen and Keys series... I read a /lot/.<br><br>I tend to pick Favorites (as I call them) rather than Lust Objects. Case in point, Sai from Hikaru no Go: I don&#39;t want to /kiss/ him, I just want him to teach me Go. I don&#39;t believe I&#39;ve ever fangirled off a movie or novel character.<br><br>So hello, PPC!

            <p>Something I&#39;ve noticed in a lot missions I&#39;ve read is that that the agents are incredibly critical of figurative language.

            <p>There are times when I&#39;ve felt it was spurious, especially in cases where the expression in question was something in common, every-day use.<br><br>However, as others have pointed out, it can be incredibly funny to take figurative language literally, and we ARE a parody society. There are certain times you almost have to laugh at it if you&#39;re really paying attention. In the case of speech tags, it may be all well and good to write something like: &quot;&#39;Stop that right now,&#39; he barked.&quot; The problem happens when the writer gives us something like: &quot;Stop that right now.&#39; He barked.&quot; Improper punctuation takes a perfectly good speech tag and turns it into something laughable because the connection between the speech and the descriptor is lost, forcing the figurative language to stand alone and giving the sensitive reader no choice but to read it as written. Cue people barking like dogs.<br><br>Another example is something from one of my newer missions: &quot;A skirt, bright with swirls of emerald, violet and royal blue floated around the floor, stopping at the toes of black boots.&quot; Now, you and I know that the writer MEANT to say the skirt floated around the wearer&#39;s feet, but the fact is that the writer did not say that. The writer said it floated around the floor. For humor, I took that to mean the skirt actually floated around the floor, leaving the character&#39;s lower half uncovered. <sup>__^</sup> Also, one of my agents picked up the stray skirt, which to this day will always come to a halt if there are black boots in its path. {= )<br><br>So, yes, criticizing figurative language can be taken too far, but I say if the writer isn&#39;t using it properly it&#39;s fair game.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I understand what you are saying.  It isn&#39;t that we are overly critical of figurative language.  I use it often myself.  What we may have a problem with is a paragraph that is all about how someone looks or sounds that is so full of figurative language that you aren&#39;t even sure what it is about anymore.<br><br>Consider, for a moment, that every time a character speaks the word &quot;chirped&quot; is used.

            <p>I tend to notice it most when it seems especially out of character. For instance, in the mission I&#39;m working on now, the &#39;Stu is being attacked and has grabbed his attacker&#39;s, er, masculine body parts. Being an ice mage, the Stu threatens to freeze said masculine body parts. That&#39;s all well and good, except that the actual dialogue tag used is &#39;cooed.&#39; To me, that doesn&#39;t fit at all, and it&#39;s annoying.

            <p>I remember taking figurative language literally when a fangirl-Sue named Shandell had Rumil (from LotR) melting at her feet. For the DTE agents, the Words rendered that visual into Rumil actually melting. The reason being: Rumil is an immortal Elf, a skilled warrior, and centuries if not millennia old. Taking the figurative language at face value would mean a huge character stretch. In that case, taking the metaphor literally was a way I could point out that it was actually more plausible for Rumil to be <i>physically melting into a puddle</i> than it was for him to be going ga-ga over a very insipid fangirl that he just met.</p>

            <p><br><br>The thing with figurative language though is that there is only so much you can squash in. Too much of it, and you end up with purple prose and something that&#39;s nigh impossible to read. At the same time, metaphors and similes can also be a bit of a crutch when you&#39;re writing when you start to rely on overused ones. <br><br>My personal stance on it is 1) Too much figurative language can kill the actual writing, 2) using this sort of thing in missions helps to emphasise to readers that some thought should go into it, and also that 3) missions are supposed to be funny, which is where having someone turn into a tiger temporarily while fighing because the Words Said So comes into play.<br><br></p>

            <h1>1 is definitely a mini. However, I would say that precedent suggests that the answer to #2 is no.<br><br>The main reason for this is that minis are OFU things, not PPC things, and there would be no point in mini-Sue-things turning up at the OFUs. Also, since Sues are defined by a source outside the canon, then they can be defined and re-defined however that source chooses without the canon having to be bothered about it. Canon characters, on the other hand, are defined internally, so if an outside source doesn&#39;t invoke the character properly, the canon isn&#39;t going to supply said character. Kinda like a bad HTML tag.<br><br>However! This does not stop you from having funny things result from a misspelled Sue name. I just don&#39;t think it&#39;s going to be a mini.

            <p>When a character is named, the continuum conjures them up. When a character&#39;s name is misspelled, a mini is conjured up because a name requires the creation of a character, and the mini is based on a canonical creature. So, if a non-canon name is misspelled, wouldn&#39;t a non-canon mini be created--a mini-Sue? Not a mini from that continuum; but a mini of the Sue (actually, come to think of it, any OC&#39;s name should create a mini-Sue rather than a mini of the OC because the Sue is the most powerful creature in her fic). Misspelling her own name might be one way a sue keeps her influence over the canon, because it creates a small backup version of her that also has to be killed.<br><br>In which case, Enoby is probably a pretty formidable Sue...</p>

            <p>OK, so a mini-boarder is created when a boarder&#39;s name is misspelled, and is a small version of the Boarder. In-canon, the boarders are Authors. That means that a self-insert or Avatar should create a mini that looks much like them if they misspell their own names. Since both self-inserts and Avatars are overwhelmingly of the sueish persuasion, it&#39;d make sense that other Sues would also create a mini version of themselves by misspelling their own names.<br><br>Presumably, some of these minis are weak enough to pop out of existence when their progenitor is killed and the continuum reverts to normal, like bit characters when a Sue is killed. Others would be more like OCs or secondary Sues, in that the continuum couldn&#39;t revert back to normal until they were killed. How strong they are probably depends on the proximity of the misspelling&#39;s location to Sueish actions, urple prose, or other Suelike qualities.</p>

            <p>1) Yes, that&#39;s a mini. They are about half the height of the usual minis. At least, that&#39;s the case with mini-Deckers. I&#39;ve picked up a few of these minis (face and stockwell).<br><br>2) I&#39;m actually surprised this has never come up before, considering how bad at spelling Suethors usually are. <br><br>3) Since you&#39;d probably be the first to spot a Sue-mini on a mission, you get to decided how much like a regular mini or like a Sue it is. <br><br>As a side note, if I don&#39;t feel like coming up with a funny situation surrounding a mini, I don&#39;t bother mentioning a mini was created. I don&#39;t believe all minis should be saved from badfic; they should be saved when it&#39;s funny. A Sue-mini for instance, could be saved at first (with the agents arguing what they are going to do about it), but be lost in the end because it tried to save the Sue and took a bullet for her.</p>

            <p>1) I think it would be a mini.<br><br>2&amp;3) I think it is a mini and I like the idea of it being pink and glittery.  I don&#39;t know if it has to be the same as a mini from the continuum that you are in, but I think it could lead to some humor if it is.  Imagine a mini-Sue!Balrog (A beast of glitter and eye-shadow?).  It would be interesting to say the least.<br><br>-Barid</p>

            <p>Welcome to the PPC! Take a giant bladed yo-yo (currently being nominated for Most Underwhelming Weapon!) to go for your mecha. And, yes, that is a large part of the PPC. Just be a bit careful with that, though—we don&#39;t want our agents becoming <i>too</i> strong. There&#39;s no fun in an easy mission.</p>

            <p>I thought I&#39;d present a &quot;gift&quot; to the PPC to &quot;celebrate&quot; the acquisition of our new category of awfulness, the Bleepfic, and boy is this ever one!<br><br>It&#39;s The Golden Age, a Harry Potter fic. I will start out by saying that the author is a pretty good writer, at least as far as grammar and spelling are concerned. S/h/it does seem to enjoy J.K. Rowling&#39;s prose style (though not her plot) and does a pretty good imitation of it. But good grammar is no excuse for the massive amount of canonfail.<br><br>Next to those fics that actually rewrite the entire books, this is the biggest piece of wish-fulfillment crap I&#39;ve ever seen come out of the Potter fandom. It&#39;s hardly Potter at all, it&#39;s the characters&#39; names tacked onto a soap opera cast, with lots of rape, idiotic abusive men, paternity scandals, and that sort of thing. It&#39;s blatant fanservice for the author and no one else, essentially. Running down the main badficcy points here:<br><br>* To start with, there&#39;s Dumbledore. In canon, of course, he&#39;s kind of a manipulative bastard, but he&#39;s a wise, deeply regretful manipulative bastard with a lot of demons he&#39;s trying to atone for. This fic tosses out the atoner part. It&#39;s heavily implied, for instance, that he did not send Harry to the Durseleys because he had a blood ward spell tying him to Petunia (the canonical explanation), but because he hoped the Dursleys&#39; abuse would drive Harry to suicide, which would also kill Voldemort... or something. Never mind that Dumbledore COULDN&#39;T have known Harry needed to &quot;die&quot; to kill Voldemort prior to the fourth book, and would have no reason to plan it from that early. Adding to that, it&#39;s ALSO heavily implied that there was a way around the Prophecy (something never even SUGGESTED in canon), and thus Dumbledore was a dick for no reason at all!<br>* Of course, where we have Monstrous Dumbledore, Saint Snape can&#39;t be far behind. Snape endures a bizarre POSTHUMOUS Woobification; apparently, nobody cared about him enough to go looking for his body before the little animals got to it. Ick. From his headmaster portrait, he&#39;s also a whiny mope who throws hissyfits at Harry and harps on Dumbledore&#39;s portrait.<br>* This is another author who just doesn&#39;t get that BLOOD PREJUDICE IS RACISM, okay. It turns out, oh no, Muggleborns don&#39;t actually exist! Where do they come from, then? Well, that&#39;s even more disturbing than the race-fail. It seems most &quot;Muggleborns&quot; are actually the result of Pureblood wizards raping Muggle women! What&#39;s more, the Ministry has a secret department whose job it is to catalog these rapes but do nothing to prevent them! Apparently, Hermione is actually the daughter of Mr. Crouch, and Lily was the daughter of a long-dead uncle of Molly&#39;s. Oh, and Lucius has a rape-baby, too!<br>* Speaking of Lucius, despite being a known rapist, the fic paints him as an extremely sympathetic character. Oh, he WASN&#39;T actually a Death Eater in book 2, and didn&#39;t know about the Horcruxes; he just thought the curse on the Diary was a harmless prank that would embarrass the Weasleys at school. Poor old Lucius...<br>* And of course, there&#39;s the Weasleys. Arthur&#39;s okay, it&#39;s very rare you see evil Arthur, but Molly is now an overbearing stage-mother obsessed with getting Ginny awards and the like and domesticizing Hermione to make a good wife to Ron. Has anyone here seen the Willy Wonka remake? Remember Violet&#39;s mother in that? That&#39;s essentially Molly&#39;s new personality. Oh, and she was already pregnant with Bill by sixth year. Ron, of course, is now slovenly, sexist, and borderline sociopathic. He&#39;ll do anything as long as it&#39;s funny, including ruining Hermione&#39;s books with a prank flower than shoots water. The author specifically stated that she changed his personality to this because she personally does not find pranks funny. Oh, and he&#39;s a pedophile. Last we see of him, in a chapter set post-epilogue, he&#39;s run off with Oliver&#39;s teenage daughter. We don&#39;t see much of Ginny, but we&#39;re told her relationship with Harry is completely fake, to please her mother.<br>* Hermione is a grade-a witch (with a &quot;b&quot;). Marietta Edgecombe commits suicide because Hermione &quot;accidentally forgot&quot; to remove the pimple hex, and when Marietta&#39;s mother comes after her, Hermione mind-rapes her. She also accepts that she&#39;s a Crouch, even changing her name and FORGIVING all three Crouches through their portraits. In the end, she becomes pretty much a clone of Umbridge. Except on drugs. That she bought from George. Really.<br>* Harry is a boor-headed war veteran who is always stuck in his glory days and can&#39;t accept that they&#39;re gone. He and Hermione have drunk sex sometimes.<br>* Then there&#39;s Jane Rochester, an OC and descendant of &quot;the two fictional characters who have never disappointed me,&quot; says the author (and bearing both their names; yes, THAT Jane and THAT Rochester). She basically exists to infodump about how horrible the Marauders were and be a git to the Trio; it&#39;s quite apparent, however, that of all the characters in the fic, she is the one we&#39;re supposed to side with above all others. And she can revive the dead through some weird time-paradox-y ritual.<br>* And watch out! Here comes John Wellington Wells from Gilbert and Sullivan&#39;s &quot;The Sorcerer&quot; in a random cameo!<br>* The author seems to have something against the Irish. Irish Wizards are portrayed as bloodthirsty religious fanatics who sacrifice their own children.<br>* There is a chapter called &quot;Harry Potter and the Midlife Crisis.&quot;<br>* Neville is flamethrowered to death.<br>* Hermione is randomly gored by a unicorn.<br>* And in the final chapter, it&#39;s implied that a prank from James Sirius (son of Harry and Ginny and therefore the spawn of Satan) will indirectly destroy the Earth in the near future. Yes, really.<br><br>But I&#39;ve talked too much.

            <p>It&#39;s been a while, though, so I&#39;ve forgotten most of the details. The one thing I do remember is that it was well written, even if the plot was slightly odd. I&#39;m not going to second the nomination for Bleepfic because I don&#39;t have time to read it again, but I do see your point on plot-killing. The whole Hermione Crouch thing was strange. And disturbed. -sighs- On the other hand, I really do like some of the author&#39;s other work, notably the Garden Gate one and the one about the painting Lily. <br><br>Anyway, I have my own nomination to put forward.<br><br>The story is called <i>Platinum and Diamonds</i>, and it thinks it&#39;s a Harry/Draco slashfic. I say thinks because the author has apparently chosen to create a new species, as far as I can tell, of magical creatures called concubines. It&#39;s inherited. Draco is one. Because ages ago, a Malfoy mixed his blood with a concubine to increase the beauty of the family. Concubines must be owned, thus Narcissa basically sells Draco to Harry, of all people, to save him from Lucius. -sigh-<br><br>To make matters worse (though I can&#39;t see how you&#39;d need to), this entire thing seems to be an excuse for the author to include constant scenes of Lucius and his &#39;cronies&#39; raping Draco.

            <p>Oh! That ties into James Sirius causing the apocalypse. Here&#39;s what happens. JS plays a horrible prank on a Muggleborn girl. She withdraws from Hogwarts and exposes the Wizarding World to the Muggle news in revenge. The resulting scandal spirals into a three-way war between the British Muggles, the British Wizards, and those nasty, nasty Irish Wizards, during which the Muggle British army invades and massacres Hogwarts, including now-Professor Neville. In the end, the Irish end it by manufacturing a magical plague that wipes out humanity.<br><br>All because Harry and Ginny DARED to get together and have kids.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m a fanfiction writer named Elemarth.  I like making original characters and avoiding canon characters because it&#39;s hard to keep to canon, especially in Star Wars, where I don&#39;t really know much EU canon (and think 3/4 of it is ridiculous). I read Star Wars, Young Wizards, and Lord of the Rings fanfics and have written at least one story for each and one crossover with all three and Harry Potter. It&#39;s not terrible, either, though you would protest at its lack of canon (especially for HP). Romance is not a major thing in my stories, either, so I escape typical badfic that way.<br><br>I am a history student in college. I intend to be a high school teacher and an author (though I&#39;m not taking creative writing classes). I&#39;ve been writing seriously since I was twelve and wrote my first fanfiction (the crossover) when I was fourteen, though I had been making up (usually Mary Sue) original characters since I was... maybe five. Definitely six, when I watched The Lion King. I love creating characters and worlds but am not very good at forming plots yet. I loathe bad grammar speling, <br><br>paragraph breaks, and so forth......<br><br>I also like to write long posts. <sup>_<sup><br><br>I</sup></sup> am interested in Star Wars Improbable AU with maybe some Young Wizards on the side (the stories there are generally brief and not really worth PPCing). Lord of the Rings has enough agents already. Of course, I have to get time to write fanfiction again, so it might be two or three months before I do anything (I&#39;m desperately trying to finish an original fiction series). I do have agent ideas, though.<br><br>Questions:<br>Who has read the Star Wars OFU?  It&#39;s been taken down. I&#39;m curious what was in it and who the mini-Rancors were. I want to claim a mini-Rancor called Anikin because that&#39;s the only SW mispelling I distinctly remember having done myself... multiple times.<br><br>Also, Improbable AUs don&#39;t have to include original characters, do they? Because I&#39;m pretty sure most in the SW fandom don&#39;t, but they still need PPCing.</p>

            <p>and welcome to the PPC!<br><br>I think similarly about original characters, with the additional explanation that you can have a lot more fun with a character you create yourself, because you don&#39;t have to stay within a pre-designed template. Neither do I go out of my way to include romance in anything I write. If it seems to be something that would develop between two characters, great! Otherwise, there&#39;s not much reason to include it, and even less of a chance that it would be believable.<br><br>I also find bad grammar, spelling, etc. increasingly annoying, and usually story-breaking flaws. For example, in a story I recently read (published, even!), the author used incorrect grammar in two out of two Spanish sentences. I was stuck at that part for over a quarter of an hour, and that&#39;s with only a year of Spanish!<br><br>I&#39;m afraid I can&#39;t help you find the Star Wars OFU, or tell you anything that happened in it—it was way before my time. I will agree with what other people have said about your last question: the PPC deals with bad writing, not Mary Sues.<br><br>Oh, and, as you can tell, I also have a tendency to write long posts.</p>

Remember to keep it away from wormholes...<br><br>No, Implausible Crossovers don&#39;t have to have a Mary Sue; nor does bad slash; nor do fics targeted by SIELU or the Department of Technical Errors. In general, if it&#39;s bad writing and it&#39;s a fanfic, the PPC can target it. Even trollfics and bad parody have a department. The PPC started out with Mary Sues, of course, but there are more sources of wild, uncontrolled, continuum-destroying plotholes than just the usual glittery girls and their drooling, squeeing, glomping fangirl ways. :)<br><br>If you still have some of your old badfic, incidentally, you could PPC your own stories once you get permission to write spinoffs. Some of us have done that.</p>

            <p>I think it should be a fish, considering that most of my fandoms don&#39;t use polearms of that sort as weapons. I&#39;ve always thought of those fish as vicious, though, so perhaps it could be a weapon of its own, especially if I took it into the Redwall universe.</p>

            <p><a href="http://heynonninonni.livejournal.com/731.html">Here</a> is my writing sample.  If I get in, this will be a prologue to any other missions containing these characters.  Beware, my formatting is utterly pink.<br><br>I&#39;m trying for a new Department here.  It is not named, because the next installment will feature a naming argument, but here are the full stats:<br><br>Department of Irrelevant Background Music (DIBM)<br>Department Head: The Larkspur<br>Flash Patch: Stylized whole note on a white background<br>Concentration: Songfics<br>Agents: Tendency toward music geeks, social ineptness is preferred.<br><br>Character Profiles:<br><br>Name: Ken Collins<br>Species: Kryptonian<br>Appearance: Tall and comparatively lean for his species.  Brown hair and acidic green eyes.<br>Lust Object: Supergirl, though he sometimes mistakes other blondes for her.  This has led to some rather interesting misunderstandings with Agent Luxury.<br>Abilities: Most of what you&#39;d expect from a Kryptonian, played for laughs...super strength, super speed, super lung control, super hearing, flying.  No X-ray or heat vision, though; he was legally blind on Krypton.<br>Weapons: Bare hands.  He broke too many swords and guns to have anything else.<br>Personality: Extrovert, but a socially awkward one.  Apparently, five partners in a row just couldn&#39;t stand his constant angsting over a certain Kara, his knack for playing the Sue&#39;s Advocate during missions, or his maddening tendency to sing the most irritating Ear Worms of this planet over and over again at the top of his Kryptonian lungs.  Once one gets past all that, however, he&#39;s a fairly nice guy...well, as nice as a guy who wrings necks for a living can be.<br><br>Name: Grace &quot;Gracie&quot; Cook<br>Species: Human, World One<br>Appearance: Tall and muscular.  Dark, curly blonde hair and blue eyes, generally wears glasses.  Pretty, but not overly so.<br>Lust Objects: Peter Pevensie, Batman, and Frodo.  She&#39;s rather eclectic.<br>Abilities: Has had classical training in music since she was ten.  Very good swimming skills.<br>Weapons: Bow and arrow, generally.  Has some knowledge of tae kwon do, but remembers only enough to make sure her thumb is tucked under her fingers when she punches someone.  Some training with a staff.<br>Personality: Introvert...she doesn&#39;t speak unless she knows someone very well or unless it is absolutely necessary.  Beyond that, she has a tendency to nitpick excessively when it comes to badfic.  Also likes to plunder fancy dresses from Sues whenever possible, and likes pink and horses to an obsessive extent.  Hates pop music...which sucks, &#39;cause her new partner sings Spears and Backstreet Boys in the shower.<br><br>So...is it good?</p>

            <p>...but is the debate on the new Department over?  The posting just sorta stopped when I said I could maybe do a remake of the A/V division.  I don&#39;t know if I was unclear - I probably was, knowing me, sorry -  but what I meant by that was that I could do it if the Department didn&#39;t go through.  But so far, I haven&#39;t got a concise &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; as to the new Department.<br><br>I do have a compromise.  Maybe I could write a couple of missions for the new Department, on a trial basis.  Like, the Flowers have disagreed on the best way to deal with a division like this, so they&#39;ve made a temporary Department which will police songfics until they&#39;ve made a decision.  It might also give everyone a better idea of where this is going, and where a division like this would belong.<br><br>Would that work?</p>

            <p>I like it. Your agents are a nice contrasting pair and your writing sample made me chuckle. I don&#39;t know a thing about Kryptonians but you explained every relevant detail without bogging down the narrative, and that&#39;s not only hard to do but often entirely neglected, so I particularly applaud you for that. Well done. <br><br>One tiny, probably entirely irrelevant thing: <br><i>to make sure her thumb is tucked under her fingers when she punches someone</i><br>You mean that the thumb is pressed against the outside of the knuckles and pulled out of the way, right? Not tucked <i>inside</i> the fingers? I did TKD for years and the one thing my teachers always said is that if you have your thumb wrapped up in your other fingers when you punch, you&#39;re going to break it. Just want to make sure.<br><br>That said, go forth and write! (Well, once the debate of the songfic department is over...)  Welcome to the PPC! :D</p>

            <p>While I&#39;m not a PG, I think you&#39;ve got great agents there, and the they seem fun from the sample.<br><br>Personally, while I do agree in general general basis in regards to the whole &#39;semi-moratorium on new departments&#39;, I don&#39;t think the idea of a bad songfic department is a bad one, and could be interesting; it&#39;s just a matter of what others think.<br><br>That said, I do think that as a &#39;badfic&#39; type there are enough out there that it could be relevant (as much as anything here is) and a possible department on its own, with no need to be put under Floaters or be an aspect of the A/V Division.</p>

            <p>The PPC (as a collective) is not very big on starting new departments. There must be really something special that can&#39;t be covered in any of the other departments (and note that there is a department of floaters which can pretty much carry the label miscellaneous). I do think, however, that songfic may be special enough to have its own department.<br><br>If the new department gets a pass (from permission givers and/or the PPC board) I know an author in A-Team fandom that writes mainly inapproriate songfics (2007 songs in a fic that is set in 1983, for instance). Knowledge of A-Team fandom not required; the author doesn&#39;t seem to know it either.</p>

            <p>Maybe. I can certainly see it. The argument would have to be one of basic practicality - how do you pick what badfics go to the Songfic Department rather than somewhere else, and how do you ensure the agents working there can handle everything thrown their way? If the fics in question were 80% song and 20% prose, that would make sense, but then it might be hard to charge them for anything other than &quot;lack of plot&quot;.<br><br>Calista has a point. A subdivision of Floaters would make the most sense.</p>

            <p>If you&#39;re going to send people into songfics, then it&#39;d best be generalists who can handle many continua, because songfics get written for just about anything; and that means Floaters. But there are only so many agents who can handle the constant Chinese water torture of songfics, so it makes sense to gather them. That&#39;s my take, anyhow.<br><br>BTW, your Kryptonian is going to be disappointed to realize that HQ doesn&#39;t have a yellow sun, as it&#39;s entirely indoors. So he&#39;ll only be able to recharge his powers when he&#39;s in an appropriate continuum, on a planet with a yellow sun, undisguised.</p>

            <p>I actually had the same issue about two months back, when I was thinking about the idea.  I put the question up to the Board, and Neshomeh told me that since a department of songfics would police a specific type of badfic, it could probably stand on its own.  However, the Kryptonian hails from Floaters...I was thinking he could be the expert on multiple continuums, while Grace is the music whiz.<br><br>Yeah, he&#39;s run into that...it&#39;s why he doesn&#39;t tear doors of their hinges on a more regular basis.  He gets in trouble a lot for taking off his disguise during missions, but so far he&#39;s been discreet enough only to to so when the Sue won&#39;t notice.</p>

Since A/V is the home of the Cryptomusic Archives, and their directive is to collect audio and video footage from throughout the PPC-surveyed multiverse, the songfic thing might fit in there. That would eliminate the need for the fic in question to be killable, just as long as it&#39;s strange and interesting.<br><br>Thoughts?<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Do DoSAT agents have permission to kill badfic? It seems like the collecting of the badfic would be a different department from the killing of it. Kind of like the difference between DMS and DMSE&amp;R. <br><br>I kind of do like the idea of a whole new department, especially if there&#39;s a newly promoted Flower to go with it. Earlier, in the discussion about Medical, there was talk of the potential comedy of that situation, and I can see it being played out well here. <br><br>Interesting thought: if you don&#39;t want to create a new department, songfics could go into DIC. After all, they are taking two different canons and mashing them together, often very badly. I don&#39;t know if songs lacking music videos are technically their own canon, but coping with songfics could involve sending the canons back to their own world and making certain the lyrics aren&#39;t mangled, etc. <br><br>I also think that either just A/V or DoSAT proper might want to find a way to modify glopsnerch to work against songfics. From what I&#39;ve read, they&#39;re deafening. <br><br>Oh, and by the way, I do like your introductory piece, Italian for Grandma. The bit about Ken being from a comic book background made me laugh.

            <p>In my opinion, alignment is very dependent on one&#39;s perspective. Some people may think they&#39;re doing good, but are actually causing more harm, and likewise an &quot;evil&quot; character might actually be doing more good than bad. It all depends on how you see yourself, and how others see you, as well as your actions, which are even more important. If you end up killing a bunch of (insert sentient species here), of course they&#39;re going to think you&#39;re evil, you just slaughtered them! Likewise, if you help them out instead, they&#39;re going to like you more and percieve you as &quot;good&quot;.<br><br>That&#39;s my two (insert fictional currency here) on the thought.</p>

            <p>D&amp;D, where alignments started, uses an absolute morality system--that is, if someone&#39;s evil, they&#39;re always evil, no matter on who is looking at them. That has an interesting social impact, especially with the reality of afterlives in the picture (evil people are basically hoping to end up on top of the heap). Motivations do play into alignment; but alignment isn&#39;t a matter of perspective.<br><br>Now, you can create a world in which alignments are relative; but then you&#39;d have to re-define &quot;evil&quot; as &quot;something I don&#39;t like&quot; and &quot;good&quot; as &quot;something I like&quot;, which is an altogether different thing from the concepts of good or evil themselves; so in those worlds you&#39;d be better off saying that good and evil simply don&#39;t exist than tangling yourself up in semantics.</p>

            <p>An alignment is simply a label you can put onto a character after you have created him and evaluated him. It does not determine his behavior; his personality determines his behavior. It can change as the character changes. And its only purpose, other than being shorthand for describing a character&#39;s code of ethics (or lack thereof), is to determine how spells affect him, which afterlife he goes to, and whether or not he shows up on the Detect Alignment radar.<br><br>This has been a public service message from the Committee for the Prevention of D&amp;D Cliches.

            <p>Since the stated goals of the PPC as an organization are to preserve the status quo in a specific way by fairly specific means, that makes it Lawful Neutral.<br><br>Individual agents, on the other hand, are driven by their own unique motives. My Agent Supernumerary may be one of the few whose alignment is the same as the organization, since I&#39;d hardly call him Evil, Good, or Chaotic. He&#39;s basically Doing What Needs Doing because It Needs To Be Done and Someone Has To Do It. His partner Ilraen, on the other hand, is definitely Good, since he wants to help people as much as possible. I don&#39;t think he&#39;s quite settled on the Law-Chaos scale yet, though. As he becomes a more independent person, we&#39;ll see.<br><br>Agent Derik is firmly Lawful Good. He truly believes he is eradicating a deadly parasite from the multiverse, protecting the lives of countless people. Agent Earwig is a kender, which makes him Chaotic by definition. Since he&#39;s basically along because he likes Derik and wants to be helpful (in addition to racking up the Frequent Flier Miles), I guess that makes him Chaotic Good.<br><br>Nurse Jenni tries very hard to be True Neutral, preserving the balance in any way necessary, but she has very strong Good tendencies. For instance, she has and will never kill anyone, even a Sue (though she doesn&#39;t mind letting it happen), and prefers to avoid negative physical contact of any kind at all.<br><br>Evil comes from acting without regard for others, so anyone who&#39;s in it just because they like killing things is probably Evil. Whether they&#39;re Lawful or Neutral (I agree that the dangerous Chaotic ones probably get kicked out pretty quickly) depends on whether they&#39;re doing it because they think they&#39;re serving a purpose or just themselves. To me, Evil is always selfish. That&#39;s why it&#39;s so easy for Good and Neutral to slip if they forget whose interests they&#39;re supposed to be serving.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>While, yeah, we&#39;re trying to preserve order in the various continua, we&#39;re Chaotic something-or-other.

            <p>It&#39;s a matter of self-preservation on the part of the Flowers. They&#39;re trying to stop the multiverse from going kablooie because it happens to be where they live. That&#39;s something anybody would do. However, rather than just nuking everything from orbit (which would accomplish the same purpose by destroying the plot holes and the continuums along with them, preserving World One), the PPC goes in and takes out the Sue specifically, which means they&#39;re taking pains not to destroy things if they don&#39;t have to (evil wouldn&#39;t care).<br><br>Apparently they used to just blow things up, but they don&#39;t now; so you can make an argument that the PPC used to be evil but has gradually moved away from using self-preservation to justify genocide. Over the years, things have changed so that CAFs are sometimes rescued, ex-Sues can become agents, and mpreg babies and Suespawn are saved. It&#39;s gone from wholesale destruction to surgical strikes against the Sue, and only when the Sue can&#39;t be redeemed.<br><br>In a very real way, the agents are protecting the continua from the Flowers, since without the agents the Flowers would still be blowing stuff up... but as it is, there&#39;s a balance.<br><br>Of course, individual agents (and individual Flowers, for that matter) can have different motivations. There have definitely been good and evil individuals in both groups. Agents tend to be recruited more often from the antagonist side than the protagonist&#39;s, because Sues are often the protagonist and the antagonist already doesn&#39;t mind killing her; but antagonist doesn&#39;t equal evil.<br><br>Of course, ask an Agent who just got bleepfic on their Console, and you&#39;ll get an answer of &quot;EVIL!&quot; every time...</p>

            <p>There&#39;s lots of places in the Bible where the &quot;children of God&quot; are mentioned, etc., and at least one place where it&#39;s mentioned that Christians are the adopted sons (and presumably daughters) of God.<br><br>But I&#39;m assuming that, since this is badfic, adoption wasn&#39;t in the picture...</p>

            <p>The worst error was that they skated without partners. I believe Sarah mentioned that in passing right at the beginning.

            <p>Regrettably, it&#39;s rather early in the morning, but I&#39;ll try and make something coherant.<br><br>I&#39;m highly unsure about good online RPing communities, but VERGE and AGS... The latter I certainly know about, mainly because of the Chzo Mythos (one of Yahtzee&#39;s game series - yes, THAT Yahtzee), though I haven&#39;t used it properly at all. I think I might&#39;ve heard of VERGE, but I never took a proper look at it in any case.<br><br>Also, bladed yo-yo? Well, might come in handy in an Earthbound continumm, that&#39;s for sure.

            <p>I wrote my post late at night. I&#39;ve never actually played any of Yahtzee&#39;s games, but I have heard of them. VERGE and AGS each have their own good points. AGS has its own (feature-filled) code editor and a great community, but VERGE allows for greater game customization. Also, I&#39;m glad you like your yo-yo, and hope you find some use for it!</p>

            <p>When you post these sorts of links, it&#39;d help if you could note the fandom in your subject line, or at least in the post. I was all prepared to read it, until I found it was for a fandom I don&#39;t know :(<br><br>(Don&#39;t worry about not doing so this time, though - half the people on this board don&#39;t. I just tend to nag everyone ;) )</p>
