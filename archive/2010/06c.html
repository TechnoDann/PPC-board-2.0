Except they don&#39;t really fly, they just glide on a membrane of skin between their legs.  They also don&#39;t breathe fire, because forest fires are bad.

            <p>(Fixed my name since you said it&#39;s easier to just type it in).<br><br>Thank you for the dragon, big kitty and lizard. Is this lizard perhaps a weigeltisaurus or coelurosauravus? I put the lizard on my shoulder for safe keeping. And ok. Feed the lioness meat without glitter in it, got it.<br><br>I&#39;m not a rabid fan of anything as far as I know. I&#39;m part of the Rescue Ranger fandom and TaleSpin fandom. I like The Hobbit and would like to see a good movie adaption of it. I am guilty of wishing there were fairies in Middle Earth but I&#39;ve come to except it and haven&#39;t written any fanfics saying otherwise. Based on the few fanfics I have written it is for the best that I haven&#39;t. I&#39;m also fond of Peter Pan, the book not the movies. (big long rant removed). I&#39;m sorry my grammar isn&#39;t very good and spelling has always given me trouble.<br><br>I also like the Lord of the Rings books and movies. My favorite characters from there would be Gimli, Pippin and Merry. Bilbo&#39;s my favorite from The Hobbit but not so much in The Fellowship of the Ring.<br><br>I&#39;m a grew up mostly in the 90&#39;s and I&#39;m fond of many of the cartoons of that time and Loony Tunes which used to play in reruns all the time back then. My favorite Loony Tune is Pepe Le Pew and I haven&#39;t seen too many fanfics with him and I really should be grateful since that means less badfics but it also means less goodfics too.<br><br>Within the last year I got hooked on role playing (in the Redwall fandom) and I now own most of the books in that series because of it. I&#39;ve been role playing a year and a half now but the MUCK I role play on isn&#39;t as strict on some aspects of the cannon as some would like I know but it&#39;s kinda of an AU as it&#39;s set many years after the books (any events from any of the books are refereed to as having happened ages ago).<br><br>Takes the scarf and jelly babies.</p>

            <p>I love much of Rudyard Kipling&#39;s work especially his Mowgli stories. Like Peter Pan I prefer the books to the movies but I&#39;ve seen most if not all the movies there are based off of the stories about Mowgli and I&#39;ve seen a /little/ of the cartoon series based off the books as well. I know there is one badfic in this fandom. There are many that just use Kaa which would be fine as Kipling&#39;s stories are public domain now except they use Disney&#39;s version of Kaa (because they couldn&#39;t invent a snake with hypnotic eyes themselves for some reason).</p>

            <p>An intrepid Yankee PPCer (VixenMage) is making a trip to our fair Emerald City this August, and we decided that this would really make for an excellent Gathering opportunity. The current (very rough) plans call for staring at the landed UFO, mocking of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:EMPPano11.jpg">, riding the monorail, and checking out the </a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:2009-0604-19-SeattleCentralLibrary.jpg">rather awesome library</a>. Pike&#39;s Place Market (flying fish and all) and clam chowder are also definitely on the menu.<br><br>VM will be in the area for Aug. 2 through 8, so whenever in the middle-ish of that window works for everyone is the when. We&#39;d be starting (and ending) at Seattle Center, unless anyone objects.</p>

            <p>Well, I&#39;m in the same boat as you (I live in Mukilteo), but I <i>do</i> have a handy-dandy map of Downtown Seattle that lists various touristy spots.

I can always raid my Entertainment Book for coupons and stuff if need be. Maybe that&#39;ll have some ideas. And anyways, we&#39;ve got a month-and-a-bit to plan all of this.

            <p>In fact, I&#39;m not sure anyone has ever asked that before; not in such a way, at least. PoorCynic is right - if the mission isn&#39;t finished according to the Rules, the agents get some sort of &#39;punishment&#39;; reassignment or an awful mission. They always have to go back and fix things if it&#39;s possible. <br><br>As for outright failing a mission - being unable to kill the Sue, or something... I&#39;m not sure. If something that dramatic happens I suppose there would be a larger force of agents sent in to do the job. That&#39;s rare, though. I wouldn&#39;t worry.</p>

            <p>From what I have observed, whenever agents become too zealous and fail to gather enough charges before killing the Sue, then the Flowers usually assign them a punishment of sorts. The badfic used for this punishment is either tremendously terrible (we&#39;re talking Bleepfic at least) or it takes place in a continuum that would seriously infuriate the agent.<br><br>Or, sometimes, nothing happens at all.

            <p>I think I&#39;ve learned my lesson now, and I also think it&#39;s time for me to be able to get onto the chat again.

            <p>Neshomeh: Anyway, like I said, I wasn&#39;t here, so I can only base my opinions on what I&#39;m told. And I agree with Sedri that perma-banning should be reserved for extreme situations.<br>Makari: I think Max tested the patient people&#39;s reserves. I don&#39;t remember the egregious stuff, just a lot of capslocky spam about inner turmoil. Which is fine some places.<br>July: Yeah.<br>July: The thing is, that night, I was being sorely annoyed, I will admit that, I asked Trojie to come in to deal with it before I lost me temper and to try and talk with him.<br>Neshomeh: And did she?<br>July: He angsted about his permission being denied, said he didn&#39;t listen to what anyone had told him about said permission writing example even when they all said it was a bad idea, basically showing he had no respect for other&#39;s opinions when given and didn&#39;t care about what sort of result would be got, that he used it even though he knew it wasn&#39;t something permission givers would like while trojie tried to reason with him.<br>July: After that, he started to insinuate that we all sucked, that he might as well leave this morass that was the PPC, etc, and that he was going to leave forever.<br>July: At which point I told him I&#39;d help him with that and then I banned him from the chat.<br>July: While I agree that the actions do come off as an abuse of power (and likely are) I&#39;m not going to get involved with the &#39;should he be unbanned or not&#39; in the sense of &#39;yes he should be unbanned&#39; or &#39;no he should not be unbanned&#39;.<br>July: I&#39;m going to leave it up to someone else because I don&#39;t want to be involved in this case due to my earlier actions.<br><br>Makari: Can we have a medium? Like a probationary period or something? <br><br><br>Neshomeh: You need to at least explain all that to the Board at large, then, so other people can make an informed decision. From what it looks like, no one&#39;s going to say any more on the subject without more information.</p>

            <p>Sean! <br><br>You should come back.<br><br>People should let you back.<br><br>Uh... right, so let me slip out of Delirium-esque mode.<br><br>The chatroom is something that we haven&#39;t really had to deal with, authority-wise, in PPC history. I think it&#39;s because the Wiki makes things really easy to find; in the past, the chatroom was only used when someone linked to it, pretty much at random, in the &#39;Board, and I only remember two or three times when there were more than four or five people in at once, and they were all relative oldbies <s>and one of those was a conference on who should be nominated for a PG</s>.<br><br>Anyway. It&#39;s like the Wiki. A new thing, and one for which we might have to have slightly different-from-the-Board rules.<br><br>I&#39;m definitely with Sedri on the PGs not necessarily being the ones to ban and unban people-- for one, the only two PGs who are on the chat that often (off the top of my head; I can never think of the whole list) are Techno_Dann and Neshomeh. And they&#39;re not omnipresent-- for that matter, neither is July. It&#39;s a frustrating conundrum, since with the PPC getting more and more exposure lately, I don&#39;t feel comfortable just leaving it with no authority figures at all, like we (mostly) have on the &#39;Board.<br><br>Anyway. I disagree with perma-bans on general principle, except for people who <i>really</i> deserve them. In the past, the really twitch-worthy people kind of faded off the &#39;Board after a while, when they got the hints or made themselves so blatantlly trollish they couldn&#39;t stay. And I&#39;d hope that&#39;ll happen in the chatroom-- but we can&#39;t really depend on it. So I think we should be patient with people, and issue a lot of warnings (yes, I know, there were)<s>, and if people come sneaking back in to notably NOT cause trouble, I think they shouldn&#39;t be publicly shamed for it</s>. <br><br>So what we need, in short, is a compromise. PGs, on the &#39;Board, are here to grant permission for spin-offs, officially, and nothing else. But I think we&#39;re all kidding ourselves if we deny that their opinions have no clout, sway, or other sorts of weight synonyms. They should probably be -consulted- on a perma-ban. I don&#39;t know how that would work, outside of a &#39;Board-post, and that seems needlessly... spectacle-ish. Because we&#39;d need transcripts to verify, or something, and it, just. That would get messy.<br><br>Yeah. All points raised have been valid; now we just need to find something that works for all parties, because I feel like this is going to keep coming up if we just ignore it.<br><br>(Again: I&#39;m in favor of using bans VERY sparingly and with absolute leniency wherever possible. Anyway. Yeah. Thank you for your time! :D We now resume our regularly scheduled program of gibberish, nonsense, and tomfoolery.)</p>

            <p>Premission givers give permission to authors who would like to write PPC missions. They are not the governors of everything PPC related. They may seem that way because before they become permission givers they are generally the more active members of the community (and after they become PGs many of them find they also have this pesky little thing called really life demanding their time and attention).<br><br>I think it should be the people that frequent the chat room that should decide whether to unban a person from the chat.

            <p>You know how if you&#39;re in a ridiculous amount of pain, and then the pain stops, you feel happy and euphoric for a good half hour? (If you haven&#39;t, I envy you. But it&#39;s similar to a runner&#39;s high, which most people probably have experienced.) Has to do with the way your body pumps out endorphins to try to deal with it.<br><br>Well, what if agents respond similarly to badfic? And then, when the bleeprin removes the badfic effects, you&#39;re left with the euphoria of your brain putting out a buncha chemicals to try to help you cope. It&#39;s like a high out of sheer relief. I mean, why else are half our agents psychologically addicted to Bleeprin? It&#39;s not physically addictive; but you sure do become dependent, if you&#39;re exposed to enough badfic.<br><br>It mightn&#39;t be so much the fake alcohol, but the knowledge that you&#39;re going to feel better, and the sudden removal of badfic effects. And, anyway, people can get &quot;drunk&quot; just thinking they&#39;re drinking alcohol, when they actually aren&#39;t.<br><br>Just throwing that out there.</p>

            <p>Since The Jungle Book has few fanfics based off it and Kipling&#39;s character are public domain (so legally anyone can use them however they want). I decided to become more familiar with all the cannon and sub cannon (ie non Barrie or play based) Peter Pan fan fics. I started with Hook as there were only ten fics listed. I didn&#39;t make it all the way through the first one: <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5791451/1/Hook_A_Retelling">Hook: A Retelling</a> Rated R for sex.<br><br>To start off they made John and Micheal twins for no reason and (as is usual in sub cannon) made Peter smart though maybe smarter than he should be. The Sue is aimed at Rufio (the author states right off that this is a cross between the new Peter Pan movie and Hook. I read the first three chapters and skimmed up til chapter twelve(there&#39;s thirteen chapters in all so far). If it helps anyone they made Peter (and Rufio) 16 (and the author doesn&#39;t figure out the difference between numbers as in chat speak and numbers as in words til maybe half way through the thing). Oh and the first paragraph is 90% yelling with caps lock on.</p>

            <p>Now that I have your undivided attention...<br><br>HI! =D<br><br>It&#39;s been ages since I&#39;ve last been here. At least three years in fact. When was that Montreal PPC Gathering again? 2007? Goodness, how time has flown by! I was playing some Assassin&#39;s Creed and ended up feeling rather nostalgic, which inevitably led me to drawing <a href="http://galassiel.deviantart.com/art/PPC-Those-good-ol-days-168610122">this</a> and then posting it on DeviantArt.<br><br>Long story short, a very nice someone pointed me back here to the Board and I thought I&#39;d try to reconnect with some of the oldbies that are still here...Oh, and to make nice with the newbies as well!<br><br>Well, to recap what has happened in Real Life since my sudden absence for the oldbies: I have a boyfriend, I have an awesome Legend of Zelda webcomic, I&#39;ve been playing lots of video games and I missed you all. And I&#39;ve been writing. A lot. Also been drawing a lot as well.<br><br>For the new people I haven&#39;t met yet: Hello all of you cuties who are most likely younger than me. =D I&#39;m an old lady who had agents who specialized in anime, though they either retired, went renegade, became a nanny in the PPC nursery or went back to being a Mary-Sue. Or, you know, they went <i>more</i> insane. I like anime, videogames and music~! I go by many names, but Keily works just fine here.<br><br>So, yeah....<br><br>HI!!!! =D *waves like a maniac*<br><br>P.S. I still love that Clover. <br> </p>

            <p>Arthropods are the big group of animals that includes insects, spiders, centipedes, crabs (giant enemy or otherwise), barnacles and the long-dead trilobites.

            <p>I quite enjoy the idea.  A modern take on the Zelda franchise is something that I have not seen done before (though my frame of reference is somewhat limited, I admit).<br><br>All in all, I think the art is well done and the story is delightfully out of left field.  Also, using the symbols to show which speech bubbles belong to which characters is a stroke of genius.  <br><br>Keep up the good work.<br><br>-Barid</p>

            <p>...there were many Flowers That Be. One of them happened to be the Clover Official and I was well-known for having no luct objects...until I met the Cover.

            <p>Not being a fan of the movie versions of books, especially not Lord of the Rings, it wasn&#39;t until I saw Flaming Denethor referenced too many times on the PPC wiki that I watched this scene (on YouTube).<br><br>I&#39;m mystified.<br><br>How can anyone have thought that was a good idea?<br><br>On top of that, the uploader of this video gave us a genius explanation of why the Witch King could defeat Gandalf.  I will share:<br><br>Sauron&gt;Gandalf<br>Sauron gives strength to a mortal﻿ so...<br>Witch King&gt;Gandalf <br><br>I&#39;m not even sure there&#39;s a name for that logical fallacy.  Making a part the same as a whole, maybe?  Or just total and complete lack of logic?<br><br>I joined the ranks of various other people in explaining why this is wrong.<br><br>But whenever I decide I hate Peter Jackson, I go back to the animated version.  The animated RotK is even WORSE than the first-part-of-the-trilogy movie I watched a while back (and I quit that when I realized that Boromir was a Viking).  It makes me want Bleeprin.</p>

            <p>As the people who were around here when they announced that he would produce <i>The Hobbit</i> probably already know.

            <p>Really. They have nothing in common but the name.<br><br>I see why they changed him--they wanted more conflict, and Gollum/Smeagol losing his trust in Frodo wasn&#39;t enough, apparently; they had to turn Faramir into a totally different person.<br><br>The original purpose of Faramir was to advance the plot and provide information about Boromir, Gondor and the Ringwraiths; also, I think, to give the reader and the Hobbits a bit of fresh air before Mordor. The LOTR movie makers didn&#39;t like that; they wanted yet more conflict and uncertainty for Frodo. Along the way, they nudge Gollum/Smeagol somewhat out of character, as he now has less reason to hate Frodo.<br><br>Gollum framing Sam is probably there for the same reason: Personality conflicts apparently are more interesting than going into the jaws of death to destroy an ancient evil, and Frodo can&#39;t have a moment&#39;s peace.</p>

            <p>I remember watching that part going &quot;Huh?&quot; I only watch those movies for the battle sequences, because they are fun. But the part I really hate is when Gollum frames Sam and Frodo believes him. I mean seriously? Way to mess that relationship up, thanks filmmakers. <br><br>But, yeah, agreed on the Flaming Denethor thing. What were they thinking?<br><br>(on an almost completely different note: the Princess Bride Movie does capture the spirit of the book brilliantly!)</p>

            <p>Well, for Princess Bride, it helps that William Goldman, who wrote the book, also wrote the screenplay . . .<br><br>But, ugh, yes -- that bit with Frodo and Sam was the worst, I agree.

            <p>So, I&#39;m planning to spork a Gorillaz Sue. As you may or may not know, the canon runs on the Roger Rabbit Effect, with the cartoon band living and interacting at least part of the time in the Real World with celebrities who usually play themselves. Jamie Hewlett, the Real World cartoonist, is described within their biography as their &quot;music video director&quot;, and Damon Albarn, the voice actor for lead singer 2D, is their &quot;producer&quot;. And so on.<br><br>Anyway, in this fic, brief mention is made of something called &quot;topock&quot;. It took me about five readthroughs to figure out from context that they were probably referring to <i>Tupac.</i> My question is, is this a Mini, and if so, what kind? Tupac is/was an actual person, so it could be a Real World Mini, but it&#39;s within a fic for a non-RPF canon. Neither RPF nor Gorillaz seem to have a set Mini yet. Tupac/&quot;topock&quot; does not actually appear onscreen, he/it is simply mentioned in the narrative and a bit of dialogue. So what do I do with it?</p>

            <p>I would think it&#39;s a Gorillaz Mini, because it&#39;s in a Gorillaz fic.  It was mentioned at some point earlier that a misspelling of the name of a city in France in a Les Mis fic would make a Les Mis Mini, even though the city is also a real world location.  It seems to me Gorillaz would follow the same logic with the real performers its universe &quot;borrows.&quot;<br><br>I also like Barid&#39;s and Miah&#39;s ideas, too, though.</p>

            <p>Someone did suggest &quot;Mini-Zombie-Apes&quot;, after the ones in the &quot;Clint Eastwood&quot; music video, but that doesn&#39;t roll off the tongue very well. I favoured &quot;Mini-Ravens&quot; for a while, but Cortez didn&#39;t appear till Phase 2, five years after the band started out, and appears to have vanished or died in the current Phase 3. &quot;Mini-Demons&quot; is likely, but a bit generic.</p>

            <p>so I don&#39;t even know who Cortez is (which I guess proves your point that he&#39;s maybe not representative of the series).  I agree that Mini-Demons would be too generic, and we don&#39;t want a million different demonic minis like we do with dragons.<br><br>I actually think Mini-Zombie-Apes would be perfect.  The name isn&#39;t THAT hard to say (it&#39;s better than Mini-Neo-Bahamut), and they&#39;re a reference to one of Gorillaz&#39; more popular songs.  Besides, can&#39;t you imagine those little, rotting apes doing Thriller down the hallways of HQ, occasionally crushing guys&#39; crotches?</p>

            <p>*snerk* Nice idea for the Mini-Zombie-Apes. We could, of course, also use Mini-Bogeymen, but Sun Moon Stars (bogeyman, apparent Big Bad, notorious gambler and manatee thief - don&#39;t ask, it doesn&#39;t make an awful lot more sense in context) didn&#39;t appear until Phase 3, so the apes are probably a better idea.</p>

            <p>That was a good read. I&#39;m glad Teek&#39;s reunion is going well.<br><br>I&#39;m confused, though: I was always under the impression that college and university had the same definition both sides of the Atlantic, just different colloquialisms when referring to studies of that level. What I mean is, a university is a collection of colleges by definition, but colleges can exist independently. Whether the college you attend is part of a university or not, it&#39;s still post-regular-school studies in pursuit of a degree. In the U.S., we call it &quot;college&quot; whether your college is part of a university or not; in the U.K., they call it &quot;university&quot; or &quot;uni&quot; no matter what. Is that wrong? Did I make sense explaining it? O.o<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I think the confusion may come in because of the ages involved.  If I am not completely off base here, then the typical age for college in UK is 16-18 with university coming after that.  Whereas in America you are still stuck in high school unable to vote, being treated as if you are child in the age range of 16-18.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m an American attending university in the UK, so I&#39;ll see if I can help . . .<br><br>In England, College can refer to a one- or two-year preparatory course for university instead or in addition to the last year/ two years of high school.<br><br>In some universities, such as Oxford, the universities are split up into colleges.  These colleges are seperate and each have their own courses, and they can do absolutely everything -- except give degrees.  Only universities can hand out degrees.<br><br>In other universities, such as St Andrews, there are one or two seperate colleges within the university.  In St Andrews, St Mary&#39;s college is the School of Divinity.  Again, although the college has its own administration, etc., it cannot hand out degrees -- only the university can do that.  So in both Oxford and St Andrews, college is a semi-independent subsect of a university.  Like in the USA, each state has its own government, but is ruled over by the federal government.<br><br>Hope that helps.</p>

            <p>For example, I know that Ian and Lee have families, but given that they both had moved out of their homes and into an &quot;adult&quot; life- they&#39;ve both graduated from college, for a start- it&#39;s not like they&#39;re really in a situation like some of the teenage agents. Still, given that they can&#39;t exactly tell their families what it is they do, a visit after a particularly bad mission with some major whumping (physical or otherwise)could turn out to have potential. Hmm...<br><br>Of course, I&#39;m probably going to wait until I&#39;ve got a few more missions written before even <i>mentioning</i> their families.</p>

            <p>Okay, guys, I was going to ask for permission, and I had my piece all typed up on LJ, and I&#39;ve been working on it for days and I finally had it done - it was about three pages - and I went to hit &quot;post&quot; and somehow that deleted everything I had except for the little &quot;this is what this is, PPC belongs to Jay and Acacia, et cetera&quot; opener. I am incredibly, incredibly upset. All I can think of is that, since I briefly highlighted the story part (I wanted to make the text a little bigger), I hit backspace or enter or something, and LJ chose that moment to save the new draft, because I can&#39;t get the old stuff back.<br><br>So does anyone know a way to get at previously saved drafts? (If it makes any difference, I use Mozilla Firefox.) I copy-pasted some versions into Word, but never saved it - does anyone know some way I could get at those? <br><br>And if none of that works, could I get a hug? Because I&#39;m gonna need one.</p>

            <p>After a brief meltdown, I did my best to reconstruct my piece from memory; it was a lot easier the second time. Many, many thanks for the support; it helped a lot.<br><br>On to the necessary info:<br><b> Kaitlyn</b><br>Kaitlyn is an ex-Sue from a <i> Howl&#39;s Moving Castle</i> badfic who has spent the last four years as a test subject at the Department of Mary-Sue Experiments and Research. She was made an Agent in late 2008 due to a shortage of them after the earlier invasions (which she slept through after testing an overly-strong sedative.) <br><br>She is insecure and constantly terrified of reverting to Suedom, and automatically assumes that any friendliness or affection is a result of lingering Sueness. As a result, she tries to be unpleasant in order to manufacture character flaws (but occasionally forgets and has a normal conversation.) This naturally makes her hard to work with.<br><br>Appearance: She was a generic Sue, but keeps her hair hacked short and (very badly) dyed brown. It looks awful. She also dresses entirely in PPC uniforms meant for people twice her size, so as to hide her extremely Sueish body. Her eyes are a peculiar blue, although they have gotten less improbable due to heavy Logicillin treatments.<br><br>Weapons: Generic knives or guns, depending on canon. Pitting her against a warrior Sue would be a Bad Idea.<br><br><b> Kimmie </b><br>Kimmie is a former bit-character; she was originally a lady-in-waiting attending a <i> Code Geass </i> Princess!Sue. That particular fic involved so many Sues and Stus that the agents had run out of inventive murder methods by the time they got to her, so she was dragged to FicPsych. There she acquired the personality of an amiable fratboy (loves beer, loves sex, loves video games, loves machines, and loves the actual act of brawling, but not the arguing part that generally precedes it). However, she still likes makeup, perfume, and feminine clothing.<br><br>Appearance: She is short, skinny, and has long purple hair (which is not only canonical but fairly common). In terms of dress and posture, she looks like a polite and innocent girl of about sixteen. Her eyes are an unremarkable gray.<br><br>Weapons: Same as above, with the addition of a white, ruffle-edged umbrella in some canons.<br><br>The rewritten intro piece is <a href="http://sour-idealist.livejournal.com/4278.html#cutid1">here</a>, and I figured I&#39;d start them off with <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3780580/1/"> A Fangirl Invasion</a>.<br><br>Oh, and both of them will probably be in Floaters, at least for the time being.</p>

            <p>I just want to advise you of a couple of things:<br><br>1. Kaitlyn is the exact name of a Boarder who may or may not still come around sometimes. Be careful to be clear who you&#39;re talking about. {= )<br><br>2. Speech tags need to match who&#39;s speaking. You can&#39;t have someone&#39;s speech coupled with someone else&#39;s actions; it&#39;s very confusing. For example, these are mixed up:<br><blockquote>&quot;Relax. You still couldn&#39;t see that  much, and besides, she was hot.&quot; Kaitlyn groaned.<br><br>&quot;Great. I ended up with a sick little pervert in a lady&#39;s body.&quot; Kimmie closed her eyes and took a deep drink.<br><br>&quot;I didn&#39;t do anything wrong. I didn&#39;t tell her to wear that non-outfit. And if she objected to people looking at her, she wouldn&#39;t wander around dressed like that and waving at everyone in sight.&quot; Kaitlyn harrumphed and turned to glare at the console, which uncharacteristically decided not to break the (exceedingly awkward) silence; instead that duty fell to Kimmie.</blockquote>

            <p>Generally, breaking the fourth wall to speak to the reader directly isn&#39;t that good an idea; but quite a few good stories are written in a style that suggests the author is a storyteller, rather than simply an observer. For example, C. S. Lewis in The Silver Chair:<br><br>&quot;After the meal they had tea, in tins (as you&#39;ve seen men having it who are working on the road), and Puddleglum had a good many sips out of a square black bottle. He offered the children some of it, but they thought it very nasty.&quot;<br><br>It&#39;s not jarring; and it matches the tone of the story. The problem with author&#39;s notes isn&#39;t that they break the fourth wall; it&#39;s that they do so in a story that hasn&#39;t established that this is okay, either because the story is written as though it were being told by a storyteller<br><br>The other condition under which I&#39;ve seen &quot;good&quot; author&#39;s notes is in a story that has already established a reputation for fourth-wall breaking for the purpose of humor. I remember, for example, a very silly story in which the author actually interacted with his characters; in that story, the characters heard the author&#39;s notes and responded to them. In general, though, that style only seems to match with humor and parody, and can&#39;t be used in stories that don&#39;t have some significant humorous element.</p>

            <p>I&#39;d like to use some FicPysch personnel for a story involving two PPC Agent recruits--a traumatized Wraith with a non-canonical personality, and a D&amp;D Barbarian who thinks technology is magic and likes to play with fire.  This would involve a fire set in a room and the pair of them sent on their first mission.<br><br>Any recommendations as to which Nurse would be the best to use or advice/warnings to heed?<br><br><br>And the bonus, a fic that is so bad it is hilarious.  <br><br>PotC<br><br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6070399/1/The_Sister_and_the_Pirate"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6070399/1/The_Sister_and_the_Pirate">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6070399/1/The_Sister_and_the_Pirate</a></a>    <br><br>&quot;Sister Chealsi Near lives in a covenant.

            <p>You don&#39;t really need permission, unless you want any of the ones that are specifically mine. Without them, there&#39;s still Dr. Freedenberg, Head Nurse Suzine, Nathonea, Parwill, and Immac. Also, feel free to make up new nurses. They were left understaffed after the invasion.<br><br>That said, though, I guess Nurse Elms might be useful to you, what with her D&amp;D background. All I can tell you about her is that she began life as a Generic Tavern Wench with a Sueish name, but after being in enough fights (no doubt caused by those pesky adventurers) she picked up some levels and somehow ended up in the PPC. Since people who work in bars always have a talent for listening to people and giving advice, she went to FicPsych. For characterization, I guess you have to read <a href="http://starshadowhall.tripod.com/ppc/ficpsych/casefile02.html">Gestalt Therapy</a>, since that&#39;s the only time she&#39;s appeared so far.<br><br>Anyway, feel free to use her, and let me know if there are any others of mine you want. {= )<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>As far as I&#39;m aware, their writer(s) never got Permission, so they&#39;re not officially part of the PPC.

            <p>People being used to normal message boards, they naturally don&#39;t realize that making multiple topics can be annoying. Maybe a note about posting in current topics when possible could be put on the top of this board, where people could see it?

            <p>I think Calista has all the main points covered. Personally, I became tired of all the debates and went out and read all the <i>Twilight</i> books to decide for myself. I don&#39;t hate them. There are some aspects that I quite like and a few moments that are truly funny, but I&#39;m not a fan. No one has lynched me yet. If anyone does like such fandoms, no one around here will look down on them for it, though they&#39;ll never get much agreement.<br><br>Also, I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve welcomed you yet. Welcome!

            <p>*shakes finger* One reminder = enough, really!<br><br>Right. Eragon. Well, basically, it&#39;s simply not very well-written. The plot is predictable, the characters are flat, and the writing itself tends toward the urple. Eragon himself is a pretty standard Marty-Stu (and a self-insert on top of it), without the redeeming elements that make many Canon Sues less annoying than they could be. Many of us could, and have, written better stories; and all of us have read a great many better stories.<br><br>It&#39;s a bit like the way a professional chef might react if someone walked into his restaurant and asked him to make them a hamburger &quot;just like the ones they serve at McDonald&#39;s.&quot;</p>

            <p>From what I saw, they were taking LotR literally (as a manuscript written in Middle Earth, by Middle Earth historians, rather than a fantasy novel by a contemporary of CS Lewis). It&#39;s not so much talking about Tolkien&#39;s views as it&#39;s theorizing about political machinations in M-E.<br><br>I especially liked the section on Tom Bombadil. Isn&#39;t /anyone/ going to say he&#39;s a Time Lord? And the theory that Tom = Angmar, while a bit implausible, certainly did seem to have some literary backing.<br><br>On the other hand, I&#39;m biased. It&#39;s the first place I&#39;ve ever seen someone else take the view that M-E is Earth&#39;s distant distant /distant/ past, rather than an alternate dimension. Huh. It seemed fairly obvious to me... </p>

            <p>... It&#39;s just that even on Tv.Tropes, it&#39;s hard to tell if one is hust being funny or has a chip against the original work on his shoulder, particularly when the arguements get rabid. And they do get rabid. I remember a dispute on the Ron the Death Eater page where my opponent frequently punctuated his arguements with allcaps. I ended up conceding. I think that was probably what soured my opinion of the site as a whole, even though I still frequented it and even created an account under a different name.<br><br>Anyway, sorry for being immature.

            <p>I just made a post about minis on the wiki talk page.  People are frequently asking about where to find lists of existing minis.  I thought it might be good to make a Mini List page.  Maybe one page for each type of fic we frequently encounter to keep the pages from being too long--books, movies, TV, comics, video games.  The lists could be added to easily when agents encounter them, and who has adopted them would be easy to keep track of as well.  <br><br>The most popular minis (mini-Balrogs) would dominate the list, so maybe just a link in their slot to wherever their list is being kept.  I know people already maintain lists for some popular minis, but it was an issue just a few days ago, with no one really knowing where to look.  Even if the lists were never copied over to the wiki, it would be nice to get the links collected onto it.<br><br>I think it would be the most beneficial for fandoms where the number of minis is small. <br><br>Opinions?</p>

            <p>There should definitely be a link instead of a list for instances where someone is actually maintaining a list, like with mini-Balrogs, but for the others the Wiki would work. We&#39;d just have to make sure to use strikethroughs to indicate minis that have been adopted.<br><br>I&#39;ve noticed that if there&#39;s a / in a page&#39;s name, it makes the bit after the slash a sub-page of the text before the slash, so if interested parties made pages for Mini/Tolkien, Mini/Doctor Who, Mini/A-Team, etc., that would keep it neat.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I&#39;m kind of dense when it comes to editing the wiki.  Does that mini/Tolkien make a category page type thing?  Like the main page would be list of minis and then the others would all be links from there?</p>

            <p>Would it be better to do one page for minis in related continua?  Mini/Stargate and include the list for all four mini types.  Min/Whoverse and include the Who mini and all spin-off minis, or better to do a separate page for every type of mini (maybe with, for example, an extra link between the Dr. Who mini list page and the Torchwood mini list page).</p>

            <p>Sorry, I can&#39;t help you much with the SGU mini.  I tried to get into the show, but I couldn&#39;t take it anymore after the first few episodes, something like 5-7.  I didn&#39;t make it to the alien kidnapping part.  I figure that maybe it will grow into something I can like later on, and I might go back to it in a few years if it stays on the air.  SGA is overall my favorite, and I hated it the first time I saw it.  Completely reviled McKay, couldn&#39;t watch the show for being annoyed at him.  He&#39;s my favorite character now, so maybe someday I&#39;ll get into this show.<br><br>Kinos definitely seem to be representative of the show, and are unique to it.  I don&#39;t know how inanimate objects work as minis, exactly.  There are mini-helmets that walk around and talk, and the 1984 continua has mini-telescopes, although I don&#39;t know how those manifest.<br><br>I think I saw something labeled a &quot;not so mini something&quot; because it was based on something already small, so maybe if you do a mission in SGU and make it mini-kinos then they could be a not-so-mini-kino.<br><br>Have you picked a SGU target yet?</p>

            <p>Generally, creating new mini types is reserved for the creator of the OFU in that continuum or the first person to find them in a mission. Either way, the idea is that people who are actually doing stuff in the continuum get to make the minis, like perk for actually writing something, since a lot of us (myself included) tend to fall behind on that score. {= )<br><br>Now that I think of it, I&#39;ve been meaning to put a note about that on the mini page, and there should probably be links on the individual pages to the place that type was first encountered.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

His black hair tend to be messy and often obscures the back of his neck. His attire consists of a black worker shirt with a Floaters flashpatch, goggles (*usually on his hat), a plumber&#39;s cap, a jacket, overalls, a tool belt, and boots. He sometimes wear a leather jacket.<br><br>Personality: Joseph is best described as a childish pervert and somewhat of a comedian. His quality of jokes may vary and they tend to be groan-worthy, especially during missions. Dispite this behavior, he&#39;s extremely good in video games and very knowledgable in gaming and anime. Many people wondered how this immature dude got into a university. When partnered with Centurio, he tends to annoy the robot, either directly or indirectly. <br><br>Agent Centurio <br>Age: 5<br>Home Continuum: Superior Defender Gundam Force (Neotopia, to be precise)<br>Floaters:<br>Species: Robot (Combat Mobile Citizen, to be precise)<br>Height: 4&#39; 9&#39;<br>Hair: N/A<br>Eyes: Red<br>Weapon Preference: Swords, Guns<br>Lust-Object(s): Angleyne, XJ9, Splash Woman.<br><br>Appearance: He looks a lot like a short and stubby Hyaku Shiki from Zeta Gundam. Because he can&#39;t wear clothing, his body painted black with thin red strips on his arms and legs. The only clothing he wears is an army beret with the DF Flashpatch on it. <br><br>Personality: Centurio was the bot with the persona of businessman, a spoof of robots being mindless drones. He usually acted all professional and snarky. Due to his personality, some view him as cold and uncaring but his inner compassion contradict his coldness. His fandoms are mostly fantasy oriented, which was unusual. He&#39;s secretly a Harry Potter fanboy but when people pointed it out, he tried to deny that. Sometimes, he&#39;ll make up conspiracy theories which were usually ridiculous in content. Much to his dismay, he has put up with Joseph&#39;s antics.<br><br>My writing sample is on this link (It was Beta&#39;d by Eloire): <a href="http://sneezier.livejournal.com/602.html"><a href="http://sneezier.livejournal.com/602.html">http://sneezier.livejournal.com/602.html</a></a></p>

            <p>It looks like Sedri was waiting for more input (and time) in the previous thread, so here&#39;s my input:<br><br>I&#39;m a bit dubious, too. No offense to Elorie, but the story doesn&#39;t look beta&#39;ed much beyond spelling to me. Also, you had a chance to fix the issues in this repeated post, and there are still issues. That doesn&#39;t inspire a lot of confidence. I know you have some personal challenges with grammar, but what that means is you have to work extra-hard to overcome them, not that we can let the problems slide. You&#39;re going to need a really committed beta--it looks like Pretzel volunteered, so that&#39;s good--but the final state of the writing is still your responsibility, not hers or anyone else&#39;s.<br><br>As for the characters, I seem to recall some concerns about Centurio being overpowered, and your sample doesn&#39;t show any signs of the humorous interactions we&#39;ve been expecting. Basically, it&#39;s just Centurio bossing Joseph around and Joseph going along with it. If that&#39;s how the missions are going to end up, they&#39;re not going to be very interesting.<br><br>If you think you can overcome all of those doubts, then I&#39;m willing to give you the chance, but it&#39;s an awful lot of doubt.<br><br>~Neshomeh + $0.02</p>

            <p>I agree with Neshomeh; besides the technical issues, I&#39;m not comfortable with the mechanical tone you&#39;re using to write this. I didn&#39;t laugh, or even smile, and while I&#39;m sure you could cover all bases when writing a mission, that&#39;s not what the PPC is about. <br><br>Can I ask you to write a short piece - maybe about the same length as this - showing the two of them bantering? An interlude would be best, I think. Set it a while in the future if you want to build up to that stage of their relationship in your missions, but <i>show</i> us that you have overcome your problems instead of <i>tell</i>ing us that you will. Words mean very little unless they&#39;re in the prose of a story. <br><br>Also, don&#39;t be afraid to be silly. The feeling that I get from your writing sample is that you are being careful to follow all the rules but not going much beyond that. Be silly. Be creative. Have the maintence department screw up and leave a gaping plothole in their RC. Have someone&#39;s mini-Balrog dart in to hide and singe Centurio&#39;s circuits. Have one of them unintentionally trigger the other&#39;s embarrassing phobia - anything you like, as long as it&#39;s not completely absurd. Make us laugh. <br><br>And a final note - take your time. I know I said &quot;a week&quot;, but that&#39;s not written in stone. Good writing doesn&#39;t come on call; sometimes I find that I need a month to let ideas rattle around in my head before I can sit down and produce something good. I&#39;m not denying your request here - if you can post a truly funny and engaging (and thoroughly beta-read) interlude tomorrow, I&#39;ll give you Permission there and then, but if you need longer, that&#39;s absolutely fine. Take it. Go as far as to change some of your agents&#39; basic details if you need to, but don&#39;t re-post the same Permission request over and over. </p>

            <p>Really? I toned them down quite a lot. It wasn&#39;t my intention to exaggerate, but my goal was to draw Agents that have the necessary stuff with them to deal with a number of situations. But maybe it was a bit much?</p>

            <p>It reminds me a bit of a soldier in combat gear, actually. I&#39;m surprised they aren&#39;t wearing backpacks. If you&#39;re going into a fic, you need some basic equipment; and what they&#39;re carrying is pretty basic--weapons, exorcism gear, bedroll, backpack.<br><br>Maybe the &quot;crowded&quot; impression is coming from the way the agents have (sensibly) strapped a lot of things to their belts, so that most of the equipment is clustered there.<br><br>I like the pictures, though.

            <p>Note: I do not have Permission yet, so I assume this is non-canon.<br><br>Herein, I present the theory regarding Sues, Glitter, their lifecycle, their biology, and their origins that I&#39;ve been nursing for months.<br><br>    Glitter is a hexagonal, organometallic molecule made of a unobtainium-gold ring with complex organic-phlebotnium chains extending from the unobtainium vertices. Within the ring is a extremely massive pseudoparticle, known as a Suvion, formed from a particle-like &quot;knot&quot; of Canon Energy and a quantum plothole. <br><br> Glitter comes in two forms- &quot;circulatory&quot; and &quot;neural.&quot; &quot;Circulatory&quot; Glitter cycles through the bloodstream, picking up Canon Energy from an extra organ located within- indeed, mostly replacing- the frontal lobe of the brain (normally associated with, among other things, abstract thought). This organ, composed mostly of a solid crystal of Glitter, parasitically strips Canon Energy from the host continuum. Suvians are <i>ontovores</i> - they feast on the very fabric of reality itself.<br><br>  The &quot;circulatory&quot; glitter then passes through the rest of the body, joining up with the oxygenated blood from the normal circulatory system. (It is worth noting, at this point, that energized Suvian blood bears a distinctive Urple sheen, reminiscent of the red displayed by oxygenated human blood.) The Glitter passes it&#39;s Canon Energy to the rather misnamed &quot;neural&quot; glitter.<br><br>Although the structure of Glitter is optimized, in all cases, to pick up and discharge Canon Energy from the central Suvion, both kinds of Glitter have slightly different structures. In &quot;circulatory&quot; Glitter, the structure of the phlebotnium-carbon chains is optimized for stabilization and storage of Canon Energy. In &quot;neural&quot; Glitter, the structure is optimized for what might be called <i>communication.</i> <br><br>  The Suvian body is, in it&#39;s essence, a mass of Glitter- everything else is merely camoflage. The &quot;neural&quot; glitter, in large agglomerations, displays a sort of intelligence- the discharges of energy between individual nGlitter molecules scale up to act like a neural network- a sort of brain. In a Suvian, the process in taken to full scale, creating a sentient, although very crude, organism. This neural network can rearrange itself to create &quot;virtual circuits&quot; that direct and shape Canon Energy to create a body, and to alter reality to produce &quot;speshul&quot; powers. <br><br>This body really doesn&#39;t &quot;function&quot; at all. The closest analogue would be the Starship Titanic, from <i>Life, The Universe, and Everything</i>- it looks like biology, but could never actually function if not supported by the frame of leached Canon Energy. The whole Suvian body is, in medical fact, a giant mass of cancer cells, a tumor both literally and figuratively. <br><br>It is this pseudobiology that leads to the weird and inconsistent results of many DMSE&amp;R reports. For instance, the biologically impossible, unworkable, and frankly bizarre genetic code reported in the most recent report is due to the fact that Suvian heredity is not genetic- but <i>memetic.</i><br><br>Suvian heredity is actually carried in the form of memory, memes stored in the neural network of the Suvian brain. Concepts, character traits, backstory, appearance...these ideas are what the Suvian neural network bases it&#39;s constructed body on.<br><br>The method by which this memetic code is passed on is as strange as the whole of Suvian biology itself. A Suvian&#39;s life begins as a mass of glitter, floating in a nourishing, oily mist of complex, and rather implausible, organonarrative compounds. The Suvian then assembles the memetic fragments it is left with into a genetic code- and using it to assemble itself a body.<br><br>(Incidentally, Author-Wraiths and Posession-Sues are actually made of this mist- they are Sues who failed to fully form and instead embedded their Glitter network in the body of a canon character.) <br><br>(As another aside, Suvians also have only the glitter they were left with at birth to work with- their Canon Energy is of a sufficiently low grade that they cannot manufacture Unobtainium. This means that the more complex and 3-dimensional a Suvian&#39;s memetic code is, the more fraction of their Glitter must be converted to &quot;neural,&quot; so less is left over for the &quot;circulatory&quot; side, so the lower degree of &quot;speshulness&quot; the Sue has.)<br><br>Anyway, as the Suvian matures and moves through the plotline, it continually leaches canon energy out of the story. It charges some of this in their cGlitter, until eventually it builds up to the point where the Suvions can no longer contain the Canon Energy. They become unstable, until they spontaneously fission- using up all their Canon Energy and destroying their cGlitter to create a one-way plothole to World One. Their false body recycled into Canon Energy to feed the vortex, they are left in a state identical to a Posession Sue- a state that we refer to as a &quot;Plotbunny.&quot; <br><br>  These &quot;Plotbunnies&quot; live for only twenty-four hours on the cGlitter powering their neurons, as they lack the cGlitter required to gather energy- rather similar to a butterflies&#39; adult form. They must find a human mind in the right state (the weaker ones must choose one in a state of insomnia, drug, or boredom-induced delirium), and latch onto it, integrating their Glitter network into the brain and using up their last vestige of power to fire the right neurons before they die. Their memetic code now injected into the host through a form of literal, virus-esque Mind Rape, it combines with the host&#39;s existing memetic network to produce a fetal Suvian through a process referred to as &quot;Inspiration.&quot;<br><br>Once the idea has reached a certain state of development-always far less than would be medically wise- it is &quot;born&quot; by escaping through creative pathways in the human mind- the same ones normally used in full Authors to create whole new continua. As the average Suvian lacks the power to do that (in most cases- see Eragon and Twilight) it simply forces the author to write fanfiction, giving birth to it in an existing continuum.<br><br>Looking over this lifecycle, it is clear that Suvians are degenerate, lower forms of the purely-memetic lifecyles of the average canon character. It is my personal theory that they evolved in some forgotten shlock sci-fi continuum, an aborted story that failed to fully blossom. These conditions would be ideal for the formation of a primordial Suvian- abundant free Phlebotnium and Unobtainium, plotholes galore, active complexes of memes colliding and reacting..<br><br>There is still more evidence for this theory- the birth of modern Fanfiction (and with it, Suvians) occured in the Original Series Star Trek continuum- one whose tangled skein of contradictory canon was ripe with the plotholes needed to transport one fatal mass of Glitter into an unsuspecting continuum. Perhaps some fatal plothole opened up between the worlds, spurred by the links that Star Trek shared with almost all SF- yet more evidence for the theory.<br><br>Anyway, having left all their natural predators behind in whatever aborted world they came from, and faced with a multiverse infinitely richer in Canon Energy than the tattered scraps of their unheard-of, unread, unwatched, abandoned pseudo-continuum- they multiplied, like a virus or a cancer (although some tolerable, and even good, OCs went with them). And thus, all of modern Fanfiction, and the scourge of Suvians, were born.<br><br>(By the way, do I get a point for using &quot;meme&quot; and &quot;memetic&quot; in the content and meaning for which they were intended?)</p>

            <p>&quot;A nourishing, oily mist of complex, and rather implausible, organonarrative compounds.&quot; Hormones, perhaps? Sues tend not to exist in brains capable of much logical thought, which Lustin certainly seems to hinder. It&#39;s especially applicable if you follow the theory that authors have a fundamental difference from non-authors, a sort of &quot;narrative complex&quot; if you will... I forget where I found this theory, but it certainly sounded plausible.<br><br>If the Sueness of a character is determined by the amount of nGlitter over the amount of cGlitter, then couldn&#39;t this be a theory of all OCs, including canons? Good OCs are simply Sue-like organisms with a high amount of nGlitter, and therefore less cGlitter and &quot;speshulness&quot;. Although, there would be a threshold where the amount of nGlitter overwhelms the amount of cGlitter, turning the OC into a boring lump of matter with no individuality whatsoever, good for little more than a bit part.<br><br>On the other hand, my theory has some vaguely blasphemous principles--it suggests that some of the best canons (Tolkien, for example) are merely populated with relatives of the creatures we despise, only differentiated by a chemical imbalance. Ah well--such is science.<br><br>On the other hand, there would be a defining point at which the amount of nGlitter over the amount of cGlitter is too small, and we could clearly define &quot;This is a Sue,&quot; &quot;This is not a Sue.&quot; Ah, that would be glorious...</p>

            <p>I think this works really well. It explains everything from the variance in Sue-species to Sue-wraiths to how writers call them into being. I love the application of faux-science, and yes, I think you get points for using &quot;meme&quot; and &quot;memetic&quot; properly. ^_^<br><br>I&#39;m not sure about Suvians having any original homeworld, though. I feel that the potential for them exists everywhere, but the concentration of Canon Energy generated by Authors on World One is why so many come from here.<br><br>I wonder, though, how the element Narrativium might play into this theory. Is that perhaps another name for the Canon Energy you describe? Or not, since Suvians could be said to produce very low levels of Narrativium by causing the existence of stories? Or is that just a side effect, not something they actually do?<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Narrativium and Canon Energy really are one and the same- I simply didn&#39;t use the word &quot;Narrativium,&quot; as it implies a chemical element, which would not work with my theory.<br><br>And low-circulatory-Glitter &#39;Sues actually do put out more Narrativium than they put in by acting as nucleation points of stories- it&#39;s the high-cGlitter Suvians that damage the host continuum continuum by stripping more Narrativium from the plot fabric than they put out.<br><br>In short, some Suvians are parasitic, but symbiotic relationships exist.</p>

            <p>Interesting. And somehow - I don&#39;t know. But to me at least, it makes sense if you ignore a few laws of physics, accept the Suvion, and live in HQ. I do not really think this theory would be considered seriously in World One, but aside from that... ?<br>Nice! :)</p>

        <div class="post-body">
            <p>I was re-working Agent Shinra into an agent in another department - instead of just leaving her as a floater or a nanny in the PPC nursery - and I thought it a good idea to put her into the Department of Intelligence mainly because we don&#39;t usually get to see the demand side of the PPC (the &#39;supply&#39; being the subsequent killings of a reported Sue in any given Word World). As I tried to think up what had happened to her since I started lurking/disappeared from the Board (so many events, so much to catch up with retoactively), I thought up of something.<br><br><b><u>Things I Should Know When Spying/Gathering Intelligence </u></b><br><br>1. Don&#39;t be an idiot. This is <i>the</i> rule you must obey. You may endanger yourself, the PPC&#39;s existence and Canon if you do something stupid. This includes, but does not limit to: impromptu heroics and drunk driving (or drunk camel/horse riding).<br><br>2. Hide in plain sight. You are not there to make contact with your lust object or to make a mess of Canon. Your existence must not be made aware, especially to any possible Mary-Sues or canon characters. <i>Especially</i> the canon characters. Hands off. Most likely they&#39;re taken.<br><br>3. When on extended stay in any Word World to monitor it, you may experience ripples in the Force/time compression/shifts in georgraphy/time loops/etc. <b>This is normal.</b> It just means that someone is messing with Canon. Do not panic. Especially if you have to keep watching Boromir die before your eyes a hundred times over. Or wear sparkly pink spandex underwear. Whichever is more traumatizing.<br><br>4. Make note of any abnormality in Canon and follow your leads. If it leads to a small anomaly, it&#39;s most likely nothing. In the event that it <i>isn&#39;t</i> nothing and a Mary-Sue has invaded the Word World that you are monitoring report it immediately to HQ and hope that somebody gives a flying hoot to come and fix things. Do not engage the Mary-Sue.<br><br>5. To clear up the last rule a bit, when we mean do not engage the Mary-Sue, we do not mean in matrimony, although it&#39;s pretty clear that you shouldn&#39;t. Do not marry a Mary-Sue or fall to her false charms; in all likelihood, she has Sparkly-AIDs and the last thing anyone needs is a Suvian STD.<br><br>6. In fact, it is recommended that any spy is to stay as far away from a Sue as possible. A suggested amount of distance between Intelligence Agent and Mary-Sue is about ten feet, but anything further is highly encouraged. There is NO CURE FOR SPARKLY-AIDS.<br><br>7. One thing to remember when sending in a report: &quot;Do not meddle in the affairs of assassins, for they are heavily armed and quick to anger. And not noticeably subtle.&quot; Send your reports in when you have at least a few plotholes between yourself and any agents intended to receive your missive with mission specs. No matter what the rule is, people DO enjoy shooting the messenger. Or sporking them.<br><br>8. There is no rule eight.<br><br>9. Don&#39;t mess with Canon. Even if it&#39;s REALLY tempting.<br><br>10. Do not question the Canon. It is not your job to question or judge the validity of a Word World and its inhabitants, no matter how ridiculously they&#39;ve been written. This applies to Edward Cullen no matter how much anyone thinks he&#39;s the Devil.<br><br>11. For the love of Eru/Elbereth/Gaia/The Planet/Minerva/ God/Vishnu/Spongebob/The Force/Farore/Din/Nayru/Naruto/insert your deity/non-deity here - please write legibly and coherently when making your reports!<br><br>.................<br><br><br>I&#39;m sure I could add more rules and be ten times as ridiculous, but these were the ones that popped into my head and I thought I&#39;d share. Not exactly gut-busting funny, but I certainly had fun doing this list.</p>

            <p>I added some treatment for Unger&#39;s arm, and something about Kelok not being too concerned. He might should be more concerned.  He hasn&#39;t tested his healing abilities since he started taking Nigel treatments.<br><br>I think my biggest worry with this mission is that after my crazy brain came up with a legitimate reason that could have been used to try to explain Holmes&#39; behavior at the end of the story, I have been worrying that maybe it isn&#39;t a complete replacement.

            <p>You tend to get your agents talking about how it might make sense, and what should&#39;ve been explained to fill the plot holes.<br><br>I have the same tendencies; I think there are really very few premises that couldn&#39;t result in decent fiction, if you explained them well. With fan fiction, there&#39;s always the added challenge of staying in canon (as opposed to creating your own), but AU fics let you change the canon if you do it in a logical way.<br><br>This fic apparently did NOT explain Watson the Ripper... which is probably one of the (many) reasons it was so bad.

            <p>Like it says on our wiki&#39;s AU page, a good AU focuses on how the characters, with their canon personalities intact, would react to a central change.  <br><br>The thing that sent me off on a mission to this fic was that they took the central change and then just kept throwing in other random changes to justify the continuation of their central one until there was nothing left of the canon but the names.<br><br>I&#39;m thinking about putting an author&#39;s note at the end of the story saying something along those lines.<br><br><br>Question.

            <p>Maybe show FicPsych&#39;s reaction to a couple traumatized agents portaling in...<br><br>And yeah... I think Watson might&#39;ve got away with it if he had used his position as a doctor. A doctor doesn&#39;t have to go slasher to be a serial killer; he can do it with quiet injections, conveniently ailing patients who die suddenly... That, I think, might take Holmes some time to find out. And it&#39;s more IC for Watson, who if he were a serial killer would be more likely to think &quot;weed out the weak&quot; (or &quot;remove the burden on society&quot;) rather than &quot;randomly kill people because it&#39;s fun&quot;. A serial killer who becomes a doctor almost certainly has the discipline to learn to kill discreetly, and he doesn&#39;t befriend a famous detective unless he&#39;s thought about how not to get caught (though secretly, of course, he probably wants to be caught). Kind of a pity, really; I could see a decent story coming out of this, if you were sure to warn that you were changing Watson into a serial killer...</p>

            <p>I set out to research the PPC so I&#39;d know enough to write missions, and along the way I decided to organize all the missions on the Wiki, listing them under their Agent pages, under the continua where they took place, and on the Wiki version of the Complete List of PPC Fiction.<br><br>It took about two thousand edits. I figured I&#39;d get it done in the month I was waiting to apply for permission, but I simply didn&#39;t anticipate it being such a big job (it&#39;s been about two months). In the long run, I benefit, because I&#39;ve skimmed every single piece of PPC fiction out there and thoroughly read a large subset of that. (I tend to respond to a new hobby by thoroughly organizing and categorizing my knowledge on it, in case anybody hadn&#39;t noticed!)<br><br>Anyway, now that missions are listed under the continuum and under the agent pages, I&#39;ve also made up a checklist to use when putting new missions up on the wiki. This way, people can easily find missions written in different verses and by different agents.<br><br><a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Posting_New_Mission_Reports">Posting New Mission Reports</a><br><br>(BTW, most of the missions I linked to were old missions, pre-Wiki; but do check your agent pages to make sure I got yours right, since I did tag a lot of mission links with the continua.)<br><br>I also found a lot of information for the concept pages, which I thought was cool, and put mission links on those as references.<br><br>Yay for wikis! :)</p>

            <p><br>I have so far had two people tell me that they did not want me to add mission links to their agents&#39; pages. I have made note of their names and will not do so.<br><br>One thing, though: I had no way of knowing which people they were, in advance.<br><br>Obviously, user pages should only be edited by the actual users; but agents are different, since their missions are part of the PPC canon and should be preserved. Many agents whose missions I posted were the creation of Boarders who hadn&#39;t been around in a long while, and others belong to people who don&#39;t use wikis much. The vast majority of agents can be tagged &quot;Inactive&quot;; and if we don&#39;t want their missions lost to the mists of time, they have to be listed. The pre-Wiki ones even had to have pages created for them, usually very simple ones just listing their partner, department, author, and home page, or else a copy-and-paste of the profile they had on their web sites.<br><br>For an active agent with an up-to-date page, the only editing that ever needs to be done by anyone other than the agent&#39;s author is adding mission links. But, as I said, I couldn&#39;t tell who objected to my adding them, nor for that matter who was still around, or around often enough, to edit the page themselves.<br><br>My suggestion is that anyone who does not want others adding missions to their agents&#39; pages should put a small note on those pages, stating their preference.</p>

            <p>I too noticed how much work you were putting in (particularly when it was only your name showing up on the recent changes page). I didn&#39;t worry so much about what you were doing to the wiki, that seemed pretty clear, but whether you weren&#39;t neglecting your RL.<br><br>As for the question alluded to in this message&#39;s subject:<br>I&#39;ve a question I asked a while ago on the talk page of the Unclaimed badfic page. Perhaps no one noticed because of the above mentioned reason. My question was whether it was a good idea to remove fic from the Unclaimed list if it had been on that list for more than 18 months. It would keep the list (more) manageable, and I figure if it hasn&#39;t been claimed in 18 months, it may never be.<br><br>I&#39;ve also checked between the current list and the list on 1 Jan 2009 (roughly 18 months ago), and saw that 65 fics had been on the list for more than 18 months. Less than 20 fics that were on the list on 1 Jan 2009 had been taken off the list, and almost half because their link was dead.<br><br>I don&#39;t think the Unclaimed badfic list should be a place holder for badfic (we&#39;ve got FFnet for that). It should be a place were PPC&#39;ers can report badfic that they for whatever reason can&#39;t write a mission on themselves. If the badfic is still there after a prolonged period of time, apparently no one else can or wants to write a mission about it, and perhaps it would be best to just let the badfic get lost in oblivion (i.e. remove it from the Unclaimed list).<br><br>Any comments?

I guess they could be moved back to the unclaimed list; which is what I do with the fics I decide not to mission after all.<br><br>Timestamping is not strictly necessary. It&#39;s possible to open an old version of the list (in edit mode) next to a newer version (different tabs or windows on your browser) and remove everything on the new list that was also on the old list.</p>

            <p>And I admit, I do wonder sometimes what the point is about having an unclaimed badfic page; aside from the <i>real</i> horrors, I don&#39;t think there&#39;s much point in listing unclaimed badfics. So I&#39;m all for cleaning out the list.<br><br>As for Claimed Badfic... it should be a very temporary list, methinks.

            <p>The main page, current events, and complete list pages are all tagged with the dates. Expanding that to cover Unclaimed and Claimed Badfic lists makes perfect sense to me! Stick a note up there to tag all posted badfic with a comment and the date, and to remove anything older than six months or claimed by someone who&#39;s retired.</p>

            <p>And I am <b><i>impressed</i></b>.<br><br>I admit, I wasn&#39;t entirely sure what you were doing until this post, and when you started I was wondering what upstart little newbie was making so many changes (and I mean that kindly, I assure you ;p ), as your wiki user name is different than your Board name, but really, looking at this now... Well. Very, <i>very</i> good job.<br><br>(...Particularly since I know I&#39;m a bit lax about some of these things. I still haven&#39;t updated the <i>Killed Badfic</i> page with my missions&#39; textual victims.

Ten or twenty thousand of them at last count, and they&#39;re all filed down to a pin. Messiness makes my fingers itch, but I never had the time or energy to make more than a few minor changes on the wiki.<br><br>So in case you haven&#39;t noticed, I <i>most thoroughly</i> approve.

            <p>Lots of the canons we protect have conflicting details; I guess that the other organizations could theoretically exist as separate Word Worlds.

            <p>I suppose I was thinking more of metafics that deal with bad writing and such.

            <p>In the Redwall section of the Pit, there are a few writers who write &quot;Suebashers&quot;, where their Author Avatar goes in and takes down a usually ridiculously over-the-top Sue. More often then not, we make crossovers in which our Avatars interact and collaborate. It&#39;s all good fun. Personally, I&#39;m making it so that my &quot;Sueslayer&quot; is aware of the PPC and often interacts with my agents, but I think it&#39;s really up to the sporker. Remember, we operate under the Rule of Cool and the Rule of Funny.</p>

And that&#39;s just in the first chapter.<br><br>Did I mention the whole plot revolves around Batman - the BATMAN, for pity&#39;s sake! - getting gang raped by some two-bit pimps?  And then becoming pregnant on top of that?<br><br>That&#39;s not even talking about the abuse of the Uncommon Comma...crud, there&#39;s only three chapters up and already I need some Bleepka.</p>

            <p>That is some kind of nasty fic. Good work killing it.<br><br>Did you mean to have Immac give them the meds instead of Suzine? The switch seemed a bit sudden; I didn&#39;t even catch it until you mentioned Immac later and I went back and checked.<br><br>I&#39;m not sure they&#39;d be thrilled with the idea of people being sent on a mission straight from the ward, but they&#39;re pretty low on the totem pole when it comes to deciding what goes on in HQ. Alas, oh woe, cruel world, etc. ... Maybe they just haven&#39;t been given an RC yet?<br><br>Either way, I&#39;m not objecting. I can easily see something like that happening over the objections of the nurses, and it worked out in the end.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I was meaning for it to be a sort of final evaluation.  If they handle the mission well (or as well as agents typically handle them) then they get to move into an RC.<br><br>I&#39;m went back and made that clearer.</p>

            <p>I didn&#39;t think the nurses would like it, either, but you can&#39;t say &quot;no&quot; to the Flowers very easily, and if the agents in question aren&#39;t going to keel over dead, the Flowers might even make the argument that &quot;the continuum is more important than the agents&quot; (which probably explains at least some flamethrower incidents).<br><br>I also wanted to ask about your disclaimer, Miah: The idea of parody fanfic (like PPC missions) not violating copyright law, while regular fanfic technically does (and gets away with it because nobody&#39;s making money and the owner of the work doesn&#39;t care), seems odd to me. But I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if the law really is that convoluted.</p>

            <p>I borrowed that disclaimer from IndeMaat&#39;s last story.  I think it is aimed at the author of the badfic, really, because in the case of Sherlock Holmes, the original is in the public domain, so there was no copyright violations in using the characters. <br><br>Of course, the whole issue of parody/satire really is bizarrely convoluted in American law, so it might even apply to regular fanfic, which is weird, but possible.  I once read a law brief that argued that Mary Sue fanfic falls under the fair use clause because the intentional kick butt Mary Sue is a parody of say an all male kick butt cast.  It wasn&#39;t an actual case, just a case study type thing done by a law student, but it did highlight for me how weird the fair use laws are.  (No, I don&#39;t have the link any more, sorry.)</p>

            <p>Here are my agents. Jason will be transferred to Floaters with Jane. I&#39;m sorry about the long-windedness.<br>(tl;dr: I can has permission, please?)<br><br>Writing Sample: <a href="http://calista-ppc.livejournal.com/734.html">Orcs, Sue Blood, and Coffee</a><br><br><b>Name:</b> Jane Doe<br><b>Species:</b> Dwarf, Tolkienverse<br><b>Home Continuum:</b> Lord of the Rings<br><b>Department:</b> Department of Floaters<br><b>Background:</b> Jane was originally a Random Dwarf whose purpose was to be rescued from a dragon by a Maia!Sue in a Lord of the Rings Suefic. The agents would have left her to be reassimilated into canon, except that the dragon had been described as a &quot;Great Dragon&quot; in a world set just after the War of the Ring. Jane fell through the resulting plot hole into Moria in the second age of Middle-earth, where such a dragon might have been plausible. After killing the Daughter-of-Aragorn Maia!Sue and her friend who was (somehow) Elf, Dwarf, Hobbit, and Man all at once, the agents had to chase down the misplaced dwarf. Without enough charges to kill her, they recruited her instead.<br><b>Personality:</b> Written without any personality other than a very sensible fear of dragons, Jane is still figuring out who she is. Her reaction to becoming a PPC agent has been to try to understand her duties as fully as possible; she may be the only agent to have voluntarily studied the PPC manual. During her time in observation at FicPsych, she has developed a taste for coffee. She adopted the name &quot;Jane Doe&quot; because a nurse called her by that name, and as she had none of her own, she figured Jane Doe was as good as any other.<br><b>Skills:</b> She is reasonably intelligent and has some mechanical aptitude, but has no experience with modern technology. She speaks Westron and Khudzul, and still requires a Universal Translater to understand English.<br><b>Weapons:</b> Jane is competent with most Middle-earth weapons, but prefers her set of three throwing axes.<br><b>Appearance:</b> Brown hair, brown eyes, short, and stocky, Jane is the definition of Generic Dwarf. Unfortunately, her beard seems to be unable to make up its mind whether to exist or not.<br><br><b>Name:</b> Jason Harris<br><b>Species:</b> Human<br><b>Home Continuum:</b> Earth<br><b>Department:</b> Department of Operations, Janitorial<br><b>Background:</b> Jason grew up in a middle-class suburban neighborhood. With a family that expected him to work hard, achieve a great deal, and become a doctor or possibly a lawyer, it was no wonder that Jason became an expert at slacking off. A solid &quot;C&quot; student at the age of eighteen, Jason had no desire to attend college. To get his father off his back, he answered a want ad for &quot;Janitor. No experience needed,&quot; and found himself whisked out of his home continuum and into the confusing maze of HQ, where the Janitorial division explained that they needed someone other than a hallucinogenic plant to clean FicPsych. Five years later, Jason is technically a veteran agent, though only if the definition of &quot;veteran&quot; includes &quot;knows fifteen ways to clean Sue blood off Generic Surface&quot; and &quot;good at hiding in janitor&#39;s closets during fangirl stampedes&quot;.<br><b>Personality:</b> Jason is calm, easygoing, and not given to long speeches. He&#39;s may be one of the sanest agents in the PPC, probably because he has never been in the field and exposed to the horrors of badfic. Over the years he has become familiar with many of FicPsych&#39;s frequent fliers, and while he does tend to get sarcastic in order to deal with the abuses he witnesses, he has a great deal of compassion for the canons. When he can, Jason will try to get out of work; but in general, he likes his job as a janitor and views the PPC as an escape from his overly demanding family. Unfortunately, Jason has gotten comfortable as a janitor, and we all know what happens when a PPC agent gets comfortable...<br><b>Skills:</b> Jason has gotten good at cleaning over the years and has learned to navigate HQ as well as any non-Flower can expect to learn. He&#39;s a decent cook, though he doesn&#39;t have a chance to practice much, and often toys with the idea of opening a diner.<br><b>Weapon:</b> His weapon of choice is a tranquilizer gun or a hand crossbow with sleeping poison darts; with these he is newly trained and still not very good. If forced into melee, Jason tends to resort to the &quot;hit them with whatever heavy object I can grab&quot; strategy.<br><b>Appearance:</b> Jason has light blonde hair and blue eyes. He is relatively tall and thin, and in his mid-twenties. He favors jeans and sweatshirts over the PPC uniform and can often be seen with his flashpatch pinned to his civilian clothes.<br><br>Fic: <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/1555444/1/Losing_The_Grip_of_The_Rules">Losing the Grip of the Rules</a> (The Giver), in which Jonas and Asher are slashed (without lube), teenage rebellion is inserted sideways into the canon, and the meaning of &quot;Elsewhere&quot; is completely misunderstood.</p>

            <p>The fic Jane was rescued from is real. There was, indeed, a Maia!Sue who was Aragorn&#39;s daughter, and she did indeed have a friend who was a four-way hybrid of Middle-earth&#39;s major races. Add their habit of popping in and out of modern Earth, and you have one major headache.<br><br>It was written by two of my friends, who are almost certainly past their Sue stages by now. Intelligently, they never posted their creation.<br><br>Of course, I can&#39;t be one to talk; having once written a Mary Sue who was the supergenius daughter of the Ellimist (Animorphs). She became a Controller, overpowered her own Yeerk and became an estreen fighter pilot who eventually gained the Q-like power to change reality itself. Next to that, Maiar and four-way hybrids look downright tame.<br><br>Thanks so much for the input, Neshomeh! I was a bit worried I wouldn&#39;t get FicPsych right.

            <p>I get the feeling they&#39;re going to miss Jason.

            <p>Okay, so I&#39;ve started reading fic again, found some good ones, and mostly a large pile of bonfire worthy stories.  Some things are bugging me, language wise, as you can see. <br>Came across a story <a href="http://avia.silverbloom.net/mirror/viewstory.php?sid=10345&amp;i=1">here</a>, and some of the Elvish in there is giving me a headache.  When Haldir (who may not be the real one) is speaking to Faramir (who <i>seriously</i> needs help from an agent/FicPsych, btw), and I was wondering if any of it was real.  According to the author, &quot;pen velui&quot; means &quot;lovely one&quot;.  I can&#39;t find any proof on reliable sites, and I can&#39;t get onto Grey-company to check their lists.  <br>Among the translation headaches (not necessarily from the same story) are:<br>-roch neth/roch-neth:  little horse (really?)<br>-Mailëo liantassë:  vines of lust (I&#39;m not gonna touch that one...)<br>Ihaes:  (I have no idea what this means, but it&#39;s not on any reliable site)<br>Gûren:  (see above)<br>Maer fuin: used as a parting, but no actual translation provided (found on aragorn-legolas.5u.com; called Erfier) (Mára farië or Mára estë maybe? Hmm.)<br>Erfier:  (supposedly) &quot;Only Mortal&quot; (don&#39;t trust this site/the authors, on principal; same site as above)<br>Actually, right now, I have to get off. So, more translation annoyances tomorrow, maybe.<br>Anyone else got any translation headaches(or any answers to mine? &#39;Cause I don&#39;t read/write/speak Elvish fluently).<br><br>-Honu_Wahine<br></p>

            <p>No freakin idea.  I&#39;m assuming, since the dialogue with Legolas was him speaking with an Evil!Glorfindel, it was, ummm. . . Quenya?<br><i>Vines of Lust</i>? No. You definitely do <b><i>not</i></b> want to know.  Let&#39;s just say it&#39;s a smutfic of epic canon-raping proportions, and leave it there, hmm?<br>Does the author care?  Judging by that site, definitely not.  Read almost anything there (probably Second Chances, maybe), and you&#39;ll look for a coffin, some nails and a hammer, and a barrel of bleepka for afters (after you bury the author alive).

            <p>Quenya was no longer used for daily conversation between Elves by the time of the Third Age.

            <p>...what I can make of this. I&#39;m not really fluent, either, but a hardcore Tolkien fanatic, and I hate the butchering of Elven languages. Now this is what I came up with:<br><br>&quot;pen velui&quot;: &quot;pen&quot; is a pronoun, meaning simply &quot;one/someone&quot;. &quot;velui&quot; is put together from &quot;mel&quot; (lenition makes it &quot;vel&quot; after some nouns and pronouns - debatable in this case), which means &quot;to love&quot; or and the suffix &quot;-ui&quot; which may be added to a word to create an adjective denoting attribute or ability. So basically: &quot;Someone loved/loveable&quot;<br>&quot;roch neth/roch-neth&quot;: &quot;roch&quot; is &quot;horse&quot;. A hyphen is not supposed to be there, for as far as I remember, Tolkien never used hyphens in any of the Elvish languages. Should I be wrong, please correct me. &quot;neth&quot; means &quot;young/girl/sister&quot;. So it could be translated as &quot;young horse&quot;.<br>&quot;Ihaes&quot;: No idea. Found nothing in either Quenya or Sindarin dictionaries.<br>&quot;Gûren&quot;: There is &quot;gûr&quot; in Sindarin, meaning &quot;death&quot; and &quot;heart&quot;, though the latter in the moral sense. The &quot;-en&quot; suffix roughly translates as &quot;my&quot;. Altought the accent above the u would vanish is the composition of &quot;guren&quot;: &quot;my heart/death&quot;.<br>&quot;Maer fuin&quot;: &quot;Maer&quot; is an adjective to mean &quot;useful, good&quot;, and &quot;fuin&quot; translates as &quot;night, gloom, darkness&quot;. So: &quot;Useful gloom&quot;?<br>&quot;Erfier&quot;: The prefix &quot;er-&quot; means &quot;alone, one&quot;, and &quot;fier&quot; is made up. It should be &quot;fíreb&quot; meaning &quot;mortal&quot;, or &quot;fair&quot; meaning &quot;mortal man&quot;.<br><br>I may not be right on eerything here, and I welcome any and all corrections. For translation purposes I used the Hiswelóke Dictionary. Anyway, I hope this helps, Honu_Wahine!</p>

            <p>I was rather doubtful as to whether any of it actually had any relations to Evlish, considering the canon rape that goes on on those sites--some of it is quite traumatizing, just by reading the descriptions (<i>and they condone real-person fics!!

            <p>Not that I wouldn&#39;t like to learn; it&#39;s a very cool language, and I&#39;m a nerd like that. -ahem- Anyway. From what little I know and have seen, umlauts in Elvish only appear over E&#39;s, and *only* when that E is at the end of a word, as a reminder that yes, it is pronounced, as in Manwë, Olwë, and a third of the rest of the cast of the Silmarillion. And I&#39;ve never seen the U-accent (û) in anything but Dwarvish.<br><br>I think, in this case, the author was too lazy to find real Elvish (which technically would be Quenya or Sindarin, not Elvish, but I&#39;m generalizing) but wanted to make ser fic look fancy with speshul languages, so instead se just made up some cool-looking arrangements of letters and accents. I used to do that myself... Then I figured it out. Now I&#39;m working on my own languages. :3</p>

            <p>in English it&#39;s called a &quot;diaeresis&quot;, and like our Anonymous contributor has said, it&#39;s used to denote that two vowels are to be pronounced separately rather than combined into a diphthong: e.g. naïve, Noël instead of &quot;nayve&quot; &quot;noewl&quot;.<br><br>In German, it&#39;s an &quot;umlaut&quot;, and actually indicates a change in the vowel itself (basically adding an &quot;e&quot; - e.g. <i>spätzle</i> can also be transcribed as spaetzle if you&#39;re transcribing to something that doesn&#39;t support diacritical marks).<br><br>The circumflex ^ also appears in Adûnaic (kinda by definition!)<br><br>Elcalion, typography nerd</p>

            <p>Actually, umlauts can appear in other places as well, most notably in diphtongs. Where the English would pronounce it as one sound, Tolkien has used umlauts to clarify pronounciation, such as with Eärendil or Fëanor.</p>

            <p>...Should Fall Madly In Love With<br><br>I have always said that it seems like an impressive coincidence that Bella Swan — of Twilight fame — had one boyfriend who was a vampire, and then found another one who was a werewolf.<br><br>In the same town. I mean, what are the odds? There are towns in the United States where running into both a Unitarian and a Presbyterian at T.G.I.Friday&#39;s would make you think, &quot;Hey, this place is quite a bit more diverse than I thought!&quot; But Bella found a vampire and a werewolf. In a row. In high school.<br><br>Yes, yes, her magical blood smells like cookies, her scent is as one hundred Milk Bones doused in the juices of a thousand T-bone steaks. Still, you have to admit: that&#39;s unusual.<br><br>So naturally, I got to thinking: if she can attract a vampire and a werewolf, she apparently has a knack for mythical creatures, and although she&#39;s always going to wind up in the ice-cold, red-lipped, guylinered, sparkly embrace of her beloved for all eternity (and beyond), there&#39;s no reason she can&#39;t have a few more dates before they make this whole thing permanent.<br><br>1. <b>Dancing Broom from The Sorcerer&#39;s Apprentice.</b> The great thing about Bella dating a broom is that while Edward and Jacob both provide protection and impressive biting abilities, there&#39;s no indication that either of them can literally clean up after our heroine. Bella would, let&#39;s say, come into the house with sand on her bare feet, and Broomy would come over, stare at her meaningfully, and then: sweepsweepsweep. No more sand. Bella would be utterly blown away by this display of care and protection. Added bonus: Adorable phone sign-off could be, &quot;You&#39;re more wooden.&quot; &quot;No, you&#39;re more wooden.&quot; &quot;Wuv you.&quot; [Click.]<br><br>2. <b>Mogwai from Gremlins.</b> I could go into detail, but it comes down to this:<br><br>Bella: [sob sob sob] [tear falls on Mogwai]<br><br>Mogwai: [chomp chomp chomp]<br><br>3. <b>Snow Miser.</b> It&#39;s fairly clear at this point that, unlike many ladies, Bella has a thing for cold dudes. And as we learned in The Year Without A Santa Claus, Snow Miser has the goods when it comes to this. For a lot of women, calling yourself &quot;Mr. Icicle&quot; and &quot;Mr. Ten Below&quot; would be a turn-off, but not for Bella. No, not for her the warm-blooded and cozy-making. The more frost, the better. And the song does say &quot;he&#39;s too much.&quot; I know he&#39;s no bloodsucking quasi-vegetarian, but old Pouty McFlannelShirt might want to get on that, because she could be missing out.<br><br>4. <b>Aquaman.</b> As comics blogger Glen Weldon has pointed out, Aquaman has had quite a difficult road. He gets teased a lot, he dies, he comes back, he unexpectedly turns into a jerk and then back into ... whatever he is normally. Bella would love this kind of drama. Something about the possibility of Bella being kissed while ringed with seaweed just seems kind of right.<br><br>5. <b>Eeyore.</b> Match made in heaven, people.<br><br><br><br>(This was found here: <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/monkeysee/2010/06/29/128191090/five-more-fictional-beings-bella-swan-should-fall-madly-in-love-with"><a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/monkeysee/2010/06/29/128191090/five-more-fictional-beings-bella-swan-should-fall-madly-in-love-with">http://www.npr.org/blogs/monkeysee/2010/06/29/128191090/five-more-fictional-beings-bella-swan-should-fall-madly-in-love-with</a></a> .

            <p>The following links are not a comment directed at Pretzel, just something art-related that I thought would fit better here than on a new thread:<br><br>Understanding Your Style: Symbols, Design Pattern, and Anti-Pattern, Parts <a href="http://whitetrashpalace.deviantart.com/art/UNDERSTANDING-YOUR-STYLE-1-169660607?q=1&amp;qo=1">One</a> and <a href="http://whitetrashpalace.deviantart.com/art/UNDERSTANDING-YOUR-STYLE-2-169660702?q=1&amp;qo=1">Two</a>, by =whitetrashpalace.<br><br>I found it very interesting since it deals with concepts we also see in writing, and thought it might be interesting and maybe helpful to many of us here who also draw.<br><br>And, Pretzel, the drawing is cute. A higher scan and/or save resolution would do wonders for the image quality, but the composition (the way the eye is led across the image) is really engaging. It&#39;s like following the path Lee just took down the corridors to where she is now. Very nice!<br><br>One easy way to make your images more striking is to not be afraid to use really dark darks and light lights. The darkest spots on any face, for example, are the pupils of the eyes, the nostrils, and the line between the lips. Don&#39;t be afraid to make those really black. Also, a little spot of white in the pupil really brings the eyes to life. You&#39;ll be amazed what a difference that alone can make. {= )<br><br>~Neshomeh, who isn&#39;t quite sure when she figured that trick out.</p>

            <p>I learned perspective drawing when I was little (I haven&#39;t got the creativity to use it well, though). It was actually pretty easy. Just now I googled &quot;Perspective Drawing&quot; and came up with a handful of guides on the first page. The basic principle is that you kind of imagine a grid of lines across your world; one set (the set that goes from the viewer into the distance) converges at the vanishing point, and the second set is straight up and down and across. So the door in your corridor would have straight up and down sides, and the top and bottom would be lines that go to the vanishing point. It&#39;s kind of hard to explain without pictures. *points to Google* But really not hard to learn, like I said. My sixth grade art class did fine with it.<br><br>HQ is probably one of the only places where skewed perspective wouldn&#39;t look out of place, though!</p>
