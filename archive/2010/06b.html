            <p>Seen &#39;em? Heard of &#39;em? Know &#39;em and hate &#39;em?<br><br>I am referring, as the subject suggests, to the phenomenon of real-life trolls. Authors who, for some inexplicable reason, have published literature, some of which may be popular. Extremely popular, in one case (I think we all know what I&#39;m referring to. No offense meant to Twilight fans; I just have a healthy dislike for sparkly vampires).<br><br>Actually, in the case of Twilight, I&#39;m almost certain it&#39;s an RLTroll, because The Host--also by Meyer--is a good book with solid, 3d characters and a decent plot.<br><br>Fact of life: Parasitic mindcontrol alien centipedes &gt; sparkly vampires.<br><br>That aside, has anyone else come across notable RLTs? I recall a book--forget the title--in which certain people have &quot;Gifts&quot;, denoted for some reason by mismatched eyes. &quot;Gifts&quot; quite often have no distinguishable difference between normal talent. Main character--a female &quot;Gifted&quot; with a &quot;Gift&quot; for killing. Her saw-it-coming-a-mile-off boyfriend/traveling companion: another &quot;Gifted&quot; who can distinguish truth. Their antagonist: Psycho-king whose &quot;gift&quot; is to make everyone love him. Objective is stereotypical world domination.<br><br>Much angsting about &quot;my gift is for killing boo hoo,&quot; followed by a horribly contrived &quot;But WAIT! It&#39;s not for /killing/! It&#39;s for /survival/! The court dude I killed when I was five was actually a pedophile!&quot;<br><br>My personal distaste for that book aside, what else have my fellow bookworms seen in their perusals of that great jungle called Literature?</p>

            <p>You have a point about the romance being obvious, but it was also quite cute, and for heaven&#39;s sake Katsa&#39;s a child soldier. She gets a little angst. I appreciated the idea of the &quot;Graces&quot; varying so much in importance (and what about the weather-discerning Grace from that captain, or the mind-reading young girl who had a cameo near the beginning? Or all the people mentioned in assorted armies who had various warlike Graces? They were pretty well distributed). I also thought the &quot;survival&quot; thing was decently set up, if not perfectly, and as for your &quot;no-wait-he-was-really-a-pedophile&quot; thing, that&#39;s a misreading of it. The impression I got was &quot;no-wait-he-was-a-jerk-and-Katsa-was-a-panicking-kid-who-wasn&#39;t-thinking.&quot; He wasn&#39;t really a threat to her, but she was too young to have that kind of perspective. <br><br>Anyway, that&#39;s my two cents.</p>

            <p>I especially appreciated how the female lead goes through the entire novel without wanting marriage/babies, and having a rather antisocial personality. Hell, I thought the fact that she was actually *doing* something about her angst was rather unusual.</p>

            <p>And what I loved especially was how she managed to create such a tough, I-refuse-to-be-restricted-to-gender-roles girl, and then in <i> Fire </i> she managed to show that a woman can like kids and violins and flower arranging and not be able to kill people with her bare hands, and that doesn&#39;t make her the downfall of feminism. </p>

            <p>But yeah. If you want &quot;dark&quot; anything, then there&#39;s enough about Animorphs that&#39;s already &quot;dark&quot;. You don&#39;t have to go and turn morphing into something it wasn&#39;t meant to be. Morphing was always the *best* part of it for all of them.</p>

            <p>I didn&#39;t say &quot;evil&quot;; Having your mind taken over by the instinct to eat anything and everything, including your friends, is pretty dang dark, and for a human with a natural cannibalism taboo, it&#39;s downright traumatizing.

            <p>The human taboo on cannibalism is pretty weak. It&#39;s not instinctively ingrained like some others, it&#39;s more a social thing than anything else.

            <p>Having thought about this for a bit, a lot of what I have seen from the Twilight series is actually a decent start at a good story.  There are quite a few things that need to be tweaked and reworked, but that is true of all of us (admittedly, we don&#39;t call it good and publish it at that stage).<br><br>I am not sure I would classify it as a Troll.<br><br>Different views on vampires...I can live with that.  It&#39;s overly dramatic a lot, but I can live with that as well.  <br><br>The only major problem that I have seen in the whole deal is Bella.  She has no redeeming qualities and, as far as I can tell, no real thought process.  She does things without ever thinking about anything.  If she were to be a more real character, we might not even be having this discussion.<br><br>I suppose my closing thoughts on this would be: It is possible for a good writer to write something that is sub-par, that doesn&#39;t necessarily make the literature in question a Troll.</p>

            <p>I suppose the Twilight reference was uncalled for. I can&#39;t deny it seems to have potential, but as you say, it would need a great deal of tweaking.<br><br>I realize that writers do occasionally write below their full ability. On the other hand, there are certain works that are so /bad/--clichй, Sued, boring, or just plain badly-written--that you can hardly believe they were even published. Not specifically accusing authors of being trolls, but works that you could see as having been trolls--you see what I mean? They may be serious, they may be a troll. I think I&#39;m failing to convey what I mean...<br><br>The second book, the one of which I forgot the title, is a better example. Plot-from-a-box, flat characters, powers that are generally lame except in the case of main characters, who are overpowered.</p>

            <p>...what you can attribute to laziness.<br><br>If Meyer has written better stuff, it&#39;s more believable that Twilight was more of a fetish piece for her, written with less thought put into it.  <br><br>Trollers have a specific target in mind: in a forum, the target is the entire community.

            <p>I had a very nice day with a good dinner and cake in it. ^_^<br><br>As for the party...<br><br>Neshomeh greeted each guest as they arrived and amassed quite an impressive pile of gifts and extra food. She had no idea what the &quot;riding quirt&quot; was, but figured that you never know what might come in handy some day, and added it to the stack. Other archivists occasionally wandered by to complain about the raucous New Age music, but they were placated with free food and drinks and either joined the festivities or went away.<br><br>As the night wore on, Neshomeh, being introverted and almost reclusive in person, gradually retreated into the background and let the party carry on by itself. Since parties are often acknowledged as fully sentient, independent entities, it came as no surprise that it did so without a problem.<br><br>Bleeprum was quaffed in mass quantities. Agent Earwig hadn&#39;t been told about the party--he was sure an invitation was sent, of course, but it must have gotten lost, and it would be rude to seem to have forgotten--but he turned up in the middle of it anyway and made up for being without a gift by providing a very nice set of kitchen implements that had fallen into his pockets. Agent Derik kept an eye on him after that and made sure to frisk him at intervals.<br><br>Agent Ilraen, who had arrived in human morph for the sake of space, had to be restrained from scientifically sampling all the food, since the sample sizes required would have put a serious dent in the supplies. However, this was forgotten when Agent Barid, the seven-foot blue Troll, took advantage of the space now empty of profiteroles to get up and dance on the table, clad only in pants and a wide-brimmed purple hat. He claimed to have only drunk the punch, but this had been left unattended since its arrival and was viewed with suspicion by everyone. This did not stop them from drinking it.<br><br>Finally, when all the food was gone, people wandered back to their own RCs or, as fate would have it, to random closets, other people&#39;s RCs, or the space under the table.<br><br>Yes, Neshomeh decided as Arasgorn the mini-Aragog carted the last of them away in a roll of spider-silk: it had been a good day.<br><br>---<br><br>Feel free to fill in what happened to your agents if you like. {= )<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>There are several possible answers, but if you&#39;re wondering about a single, discreet web location, there isn&#39;t one.

That is the proper location for such things according to the Narrative Laws.<br><br>Of course, if you want to get meta, the archives are anyplace PPC stories and data are recorded. The Wiki is part of the archives, as is the LJ community, as are all individual PPCers&#39; websites, etc. It&#39;s about as insane a sprawling mess as the in-universe archives, I expect. *g*<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I didn&#39;t cry at the manga, although I did at the first anime ending. I mean, /this/ one ended happy. The first anime had a horrible tear-jerker ending, though it was made slightly more entertaining by the &quot;I want /you/ to live! No, I want /you/ to live!&quot;<br><br>I just finished the chapter; I&#39;m sort of in a state of shock. &quot;Holy crap, it&#39;s /over/.&quot; I almost can&#39;t believe it...

New chapter soon!&quot;<br><br>On another note, this one was /long/. 0.o It&#39;s about three times as long as most of the others. Probably &#39;cause it&#39;s the last one, and Arakawa wanted to finish the series... I&#39;m still having trouble believing it&#39;s over.<br><br>Polly wanna sequel.<br><br>And since the spoiler warning was in the thread, I get to say this: I am SO FREAKING GLAD they made Ed/Winry canon. Hopefully this will kill some of the slashers. I&#39;m not a particular fan of the pairing myself, but it&#39;s my favorite out of all the potential matchups. DEFINITELY better than Elricest or RoyEd. Ugh. No.</p>

            <p>Eh, I&#39;m not much of a one for pairings in any case, but canon is a marvelous thing, innit? I mean, we all knew it was coming, so I didn&#39;t think of &quot;Ed and Winry are in WUV!&quot; as a spoiler, really. Well, it&#39;s better than some of the stuff they did in Anime Number One (shall we just call it A-1 Steak Sauce?).

            <p>But I just thought of something--since we&#39;re a badfic-sporking group, shouldn&#39;t our pages on series have lists of frequently-occurring phenomena, particularly those that are prone to turning into badfic? Major Lust Objects, overpopular pairings, that sort of thing. I&#39;ono, it just seems like a good idea to me.</p>

            <p>Actually, I like the differences. The problem with anime vs. manga is that the plots are exactly the same, so after a while, watching the anime gets boring (or reading the manga--I usually read the manga first, though). With FMA, it&#39;s two different plots, although they&#39;re both equally FMA, so the anime is still interesting even though I&#39;ve already read the manga.<br><br>...Did that make sense? I hope it did.<br><br>And to the other part of the message, sure! ^^</p>

            <p>...but I never manage to finish the series. I get about halfway through before I get bored, sometimes less--and the quality of the voice-acting has a lot to do with it. If the voices fit the characters, I&#39;ll keep watching, but if they sound all wrong, then I&#39;ll just give up.<br><br>And I know not everyone shares this opinion, but the easier a series is to find in Japanese with English subtitles, the more likely I am to watch it. I dislike English dubs on general principle, though the degree of dislike varies. I saw an anime once where the narrator couldn&#39;t even pronounce the characters&#39; names right... -shudder- Awful.</p>

            <p>If a Sue goes by multiple names over the course of the fic, what name do we put them under on the Wiki? The one used most often? I ask because I want to make a page for my first mission, which featured a Blaise Zabini Sue (set before HBP) who turned out to really be an elf and renamed Elessario.</p>

            <p>Maybe it&#39;s just me, but aside from <i>the</i> most infamous, Legendary-Badfic-Type &#39;Sues around, what is the point in giving them their own wiki pages? A list noting which Sues have been killed, sure, but I would think the wiki should be more for PPC-specific information, not an account of every Sue out there in fandom.<br><br>That said, I more or less agree with the others: The &#39;real&#39; name would be best, but if it&#39;s very similar to other names, take the more unique version - Elessario, in this case, certainly. The only down side to this is that people who started reading the badfic and didn&#39;t get as far as that name&#39;s first mention might not connect the two. But, eh. </p>

            <p>I think the best thing to do is to use the most &quot;official&quot; name avaible. If the sue is called X, but then is discovered that her true/complete name is Y, then is to be called Y. If all names are at the same level of importance, use the one found in the fiction description.</p>

            <p>If it is found out that the character&#39;s true name is Elessario, then that is the Sue&#39;s name.  It further proves that they are not the real Blaise Zabini, so it should be the name on the wiki with Blaise Zabini as an alias.</p>

            <p>Posting here to avoid double-posting. Recently I agreed to co-mod an LJ community with someone I didn&#39;t really know - it sort of got spawned out of a joke I made which started up a conversation. Since then, that person has been involved in a lot of nasty flamewars on LJ&#39;s Fanficrants community. I don&#39;t really want to be associated with them anymore because of this. However, we haven&#39;t actually talked since we set the comm in question up, the comm hasn&#39;t got much traffic, and we&#39;re not on each other&#39;s friendslists. Does anyone think it necessary for me to drop the community and leave them to it, or carry on and just ignore them since the comm doesn&#39;t actually require us to interact?</p>

            <p>I hereby humbly request Permission. My Agents&#39; info is as follows:<br><br>Name: Amelia Keaton (Lee); Agent Keaton and/or Agent Lee<br>Age: 26<br>Species: Lithrani   [Tri-morphic shapeshifter (She can shift between cougar, human, and humanoid cougar forms and it&#39;s not lunar controlled; therefore, she&#39;s not considered a true were-creature. She tends to stay in human form, though, since missions are never predictable, and it&#39;s easier for her to program the disguise generator for human-shaped forms and not have to worry about tails.) ]<br>Home Continuum:  Magical Alternate Modern Day World One; Home Town: Brooklyn, NYC, NY<br>Height: 5&#39;6&quot;<br>Hair: Blonde<br>Eyes: Green<br>Department: DMS<br>Partner: Ian Nahinu<br>Fandom(s): Stargate Atlantis, Leverage, Stargate Universe, Firefly, Discworld, CSI: NY, NCIS, CSI, Eureka, Warehouse 13, Star Wars (She prefers the Original Trilogy, though, holding the Prequels in high distaste), LotR, PotC<br><br>Lust-object(s): Peter Kavanagh, David Hodges, Dale Volker, Nikola Tesla (Sanctuary). She tends to go for side characters, going under the logic that since most &#39;Sues ignore them, she won&#39;t go Bursar and muck up the mission.<br><br>Weapon(s): Claws and teeth when in full cougar form; generally either a wand, sword, bow, or gun, depending on what&#39;s considered canon in the Word World she&#39;s going into for everything else. For guns, she likes a Beretta 92FS for small arms, and a P-90 for large guns (when applicable). She always carries her cast-iron Frying Pan of Doom(tm) with her in her Weightless &amp; Bottomless Satchel; she says it&#39;s to attempt to knock some sense into &#39;Sues and Author Wraiths. Also, it&#39;s quite useful for camping. She is also able to use Elemental magics, with Water being her strongest Element, followed by Earth, Air, and Fire (in order of aptitude).<br><br>Personality: She&#39;s the more temperamental of the pair, and utilizes a large vocabulary of invectives from many different fandoms, though she tends to use <i>Firefly</i> slang quite a bit. She has been more than once accused of not having a sense of humor, though this is mainly because hers makes appearances only rarely in groups she isn&#39;t entirely comfortable with. Her partner, Ian, is often confused when people talk about Lee&#39;s lack of a sense of humor, but then again, he&#39;s also spent the most time with her and therefore sees more of her dry humor. Lee likes to bake when she has the time, and will often drop brownies or other baked goods off at the RCs of newbies or give them to the few friends she&#39;s managed to make and hold on to.<br><br>Notes: Her species stops physically aging ~25 and lives for ~700 years or so on average, but can be killed by any normal means- shooting, stabbing, etc.  everyone in her home continuum has magical abilities, and Lee had been a freelance Mage-Detective for a private company in NYC, but she&#39;d been laid off a few weeks prior to her recruitment by the PPC. She&#39;s best at offensive and defensive magics, but can do some healing spells as well (Anything above a complex break of a bone is beyond her- she can&#39;t do much with internal bleeding and the like.), and a few party-trick-style spells, like simple levitation of small objects and pretty colored lights in the air. She keeps several small novelty fountains near her bed to help her feel a bit more connected with her elemental powers, since she hasn&#39;t found anywhere in HQ so far that&#39;s got a large amount of water in it that isn&#39;t either chlorinated or isn&#39;t mixed with Bleeprin.<br><br><br>Name: Ian Nahinu; Agent Nahinu<br>Age: 24<br>Species: Human<br>Home Continuum: World One; Hometown: Honolulu, Hawai&#39;i<br>Department: DMS<br>Divison: Freelance<br>Partner: Amelia Moorehaven<br>Fandom(s): Most Sci-fi fandoms (Save for BSG and Babylon 5), Discworld, Criminal Minds, NCIS, NCIS: LA, PotC, LotR<br>Lust-object(s): Emily Prentiss, Kathryn Janeway, Leia<br><br>Weapon(s): Generally whatever&#39;s considered canon, but most often a gun- a Sig Sauer P220 that he carries around in a thigh holster. He&#39;s okay with a sword, but if he has to deal with bladed weapons, he&#39;ll go for the switchblade he keeps on him at all times. He&#39;s also been known to employ whatever nearby object that can be used as a weapon, often a hammer of some sort, causing Lee to make jokes about him watching and/or playing &quot;Clue&quot; one too many times. <br><br>Appearance: He kind of resembles Jason Momoa/Ronon Dex from <i>Stargate Atlantis</i>, in that he is of Native Samoan stock, is tall, and wears his hair in dreadlocks that have beads decorating them. He normally keeps them tied back with a leather tie for missions, but will let the dreads hang free when he&#39;s bumming around HQ. His resemblance to Ronon/Jason means that he is in danger of getting glomped by agents with Ronon as their registered LO. Lee finds this very funny, but is in fact quite protective of her partner, and will ward off anyone who makes him too uncomfortable. He has brown eyes and is around 6&#39;3&quot;. He has a small koi fish tattooed on his upper back, in between his shoulderblades. He occasionally wears a head scarf, and is well aware that it makes him look like a pirate, but could care less.<br><br>Personality: Ian is quite laid back when compared to Lee, and tends to be more at home with large crowds. He&#39;s quick on his feet when it comes to restraining Lee when she gets too annoyed with something. He&#39;s still getting used to the fact that magic really does exist and that he&#39;s now working for a bunch of sentient Flowers. He is often caught off guard by some of Lee&#39;s habits, but will more often than not ignore them if they&#39;re not hazardous to either of them or to the outcome of a mission. He is protective of Lee, but also is trying to get her to be a bit more social, which is taking some doing.<br><br>My writing sample is <a href="http://rc-6237.livejournal.com/719.html">here</a>. *crosses fingers and hopes for the best*</p>

            <p>Just two things I want to mention, only one of which might be an ongoing problem. First the easy one: you seem to have entered &quot;Amelia Moorehaven&quot; instead of &quot;Amelia Keaton&quot; as Ian&#39;s partner. Were you toying with different names? {= )<br><br>Second, in-sentence parenthetical remarks don&#39;t need to be punctuated like separate sentences. What you have here is wrong:<br><blockquote>She wandered the halls, softly singing a few verses of &quot;I Wanna Be a Producer&quot; under her breath (She had a great fondness for musicals, especially the comedic ones, though she had a soft spot in her heart reserved especially for The Rocky Horror Show and its movie adaptation.) and not entirely paying attention to where she was going, which was just as well, given the odd multidimensional topography that made up the seemingly endless gray hallways and rooms of the PPC.</blockquote>
<br>It might be best to break that long sentence up into smaller ones, but assuming you want to keep it one sentence, the parenthetical remark should be uncapitalized and externally punctuated:<br><blockquote>She wandered the halls, softly singing a few verses of &quot;I Wanna Be a Producer&quot; under her breath (she had a great fondness for musicals, especially the comedic ones, though she had a soft spot in her heart reserved especially for The Rocky Horror Show and its movie adaptation), and ...</blockquote>
<br>On the other hand, if a parenthetical remark is outside of any other sentence, it should be punctuated internally and capitalized.<br><br>Let me know if that all makes sense.<br><br>Otherwise, enjoy your new hobby!<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I&#39;d like to have agents David Kelok and Unger assigned to RC 1729.  It is not listed as taken on the wiki, and it is a cool number, being the smallest number expressible as the sum of two positive cubes in two different ways.<br><br>I think for now, at least, I am assigning them to the Department of Floaters.</p>

            <p>It&#39;s not a singular fic, but it&#39;s a weird and ghastly mixture of bad sprite comic and badfic (though the writing is worse than the sprite stuff), the worst of both worlds. It&#39;s called &quot;Simon Quest Zero&quot;, there&#39;s supposed to be some kind of prequel to it in the author&#39;s gallery, but I don&#39;t want to trudge through all his stuff just to find it. I haven&#39;t finished with this &#39;fic&#39;, but what I&#39;ve seen is enough to say it&#39;s bad, I think.<br><br>Of course, it&#39;s good for a laugh anyway.<br><br><a href="http://belmondo4447.deviantart.com/gallery/#Simon-Quest-Zero"><a href="http://belmondo4447.deviantart.com/gallery/#Simon-Quest-Zero">http://belmondo4447.deviantart.com/gallery/#Simon-Quest-Zero</a></a><br><br>In summary: An implausible crossover involving Castlevania and Mega Man, mainly, with characters from all over each series&#39; respective timelines, but multiple other continuities appear from Pokemon to Zelda. The main focus of the plot involves one of the most crackiest crossover ships I have ever seen - Simon freakn&#39; Belmont and Leviathan from Mega Man Zero. No, seriously. Plus, <i>they have kids.</i> Note that the female of the pairing is a <i>Reploid</i>, a very advanced robot, but a robot nontheless. Canon defilement up the wazoo, along with bad grammar and spelling and just bad writing overall. On the visual side, not much to charge for, aside from bad speech bubbles (even in MS Paint, one can easily do better). Oh, yeah, and particular part adds songfic to the list.<br><br>tl;dr: Badly-done crossover pairing fic that&#39;s crackier than crack and combines bad sprite comics with normal badfic. I&#39;ll give a better impression when I finish looking at the whole thing.<br><br>Also, Evil!Soma Cruz makes me grumble, but that&#39;s not really a charge.</p>

            <p>I don&#39;t believe we&#39;ve met. I&#39;m Pretzel, and it&#39;s nice to meet you. Welcome back! I know how it is with idiotic computers and stuff- my power cord for my laptop managed to crap out on me for a good two months, so I was without my computer during the last bit of my previous quarter in college. Not fun. <br><br>As for the party, my agents shall definitely be joining in, now that I&#39;ve got Permission and stuff. They are Ian Nahinu and Lee Keaton. Feel free to do with them as you wish; Lee&#39;s a bit of a lightweight when it comes to alcohol, and anything with mint in it gets her even more tipsy/snuggle-prone (which is weird, &#39;cause she&#39;s normally not all that touchy-feely), as she&#39;s a feline-based shapeshifter and therefore affected by anything in the mint family, like catnip. (For further info, look either on the Wiki or <a href="http://rc-6237.livejournal.com/">here</a>).<br><br>My apologies for rambling; I do that quite a bit.

            <p>Thanks for the ship. The second you gave me!<br><br>And about the party: Your agents are most welcome. I am not quite sure if, and if so, when I will write an account of the party, but your agents will certainly be mentioned if that happens.<br>I will host the party in an as of yet unknown location (I am open for any suggenstions), and I will take care of all drinks, mainly beer and soda, but again, open to suggestions. The only thing I won&#39;t offer is the Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster, as laws of physics state it cannot be mixed on Earth. If someone wants, I will also offer BBQ.</p>

            <p>I was cruising around looking for a Mary Sue to kill in my new fandom of Sherlock Holmes 2009. The vast majority of fics for the movie--even considering the open invitation to all slashers given in the movie there is an almost total absence of bad slash--and especially for the books are exceptionally well written.  Even when they have strange premises that would normally be handled in the worst possible ways, it is hard to find any charges.  So in general a source of goodfic would be the Sherlock Holmes sections of the pit.<br><br>However, I found this story:  <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4306702/1/World_Guardians_3_the_Inbetween"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4306702/1/World_Guardians_3_the_Inbetween">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4306702/1/World_Guardians_3_the_Inbetween</a></a><br><br>I don&#39;t know quite what to make of it.  The author took the time to write a summary pertaining to Sherlock Holmes, to list the characters involved as being from Sherlock Holmes, and then proceeded to post chapters with which I can discern no possible link to Sherlock Holmes.<br><br>In fact, it seems very much like the story is based on some other fandom.  Okay, so I finally realized that with a 3 in the title there must be more of these around.  I checked the other stories with the same characters, and I found the annoying origin of the Sue here:  <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2757381/1/world_Guardians_the_warrior"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2757381/1/world_Guardians_the_warrior">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2757381/1/world_Guardians_the_warrior</a></a><br><br>It is a badly handled mangling of the Star Wars prequels era continuum that has now been shared over to Sherlock Holmes.  For a multi-story Sue is it typical to go after each of their stories, or does once suffice to kill them entirely?  I am kind of leaning toward, if I kill her in the Holmes story that she would still be messing up Star Wars, because of her other stories, but I am sure this has been dealt with before.<br><br>The Holmes story is apparently not complete.  The others are all much longer, and like I said there is no actual mention of anything at all relating to Holmes.  Any advice for how to handle a story that never even gets around to mentioning the continuum in question?</p>

            <p>I posted the Holmes story under Claimed badfic on the wiki, and the Star Wars stories under Unclaimed badfic.  I left a note with them that I will be happy to lend my agents to a joint killing of them all at once.  I&#39;ve never done a collaboration before, so if any of the people who have stated an interest in this has I will defer to your experience on how to handle it.</p>

            <p>There is a surprising quantity of goodfic in the movie section and the book section.  A lot of times I will see a summary that anywhere else on the pit is guaranteed to be a poorly written Sue with a terrible plot, and even if it turns out to not be an idea I care too much about, the writing is in actual English, the plot holds water--overall if not goodfic then at least non-PPCable fic.<br><br>I don&#39;t really understand it.  Sure, the characters involved are much smarter than average, but that hasn&#39;t stopped people from writing badly in Bones and House.  The books are old enough to maybe earn a miss from a lot of fanbrats, but the movie had two very fine looking men, who gave off enough slashy vibes to set any fangirl to drooling, and even there the <i>overall</i> quality of the writing is high.  Of course there are a few that are badly done, but the proportion is almost reversed from most fandoms.  <br><br>It really has gotten my curiosity up about how this fandom has managed to attract a more highly skilled group of writers.</p>

I glared into my own reflection, too tired to turn and glare at Brian. It was pointless to answer, anyway. He already knew the answer.<br><br>“But I want to entertain you. You look so bored and lifeless.” I could almost hear the wistful sigh behind his voice. “You were so cheerful and bright before!”<br><br>“I was cheerful and bright back there because it was my own life, Brian. This place is flat, and gray, and just… this.” I gestured out the window with a limp hand, and did turn to glare at him this time. “I hate it, I hate being here, and I hate this.”<br><br>He made a humming noise under his breath and sort of shrugged a little, his voice briefly – very briefly – devoid of its customary too-cheerful energy. “You’ll get used to it though. I swear you will.” <br><br>I snorted. There wasn’t an answer to that. The hours stretched on before us, bleak and lifeless as the endlessly sepia-toned miles we traveled  together, and as devoid of promise.<br><br>“Look at that!”<br><br>I’d seen it about ten minutes prior, or the signs for it – the only signs of life or color we’d seen for a good three days, you’d better believe I was interested, even if it had only been for a moment, even if it was only a county fair, the kind of which you really have seen one, and seen them all. The only weird thing on passing the sign had been that Brian had withheld comment – a situation which he apparently had decided to remedy. Great.<br><br>“Oh, great. A way to make the trip even longer.”<br><br>He gave me one of those dazzling, bright, sugary, creepy smiles. “Savoring every second!” I ignored him. “Come on though! It’ll be really fun!”<br><br>“I honestly don’t care, Brian. Like I said, it’s just another way of dragging this thing out.” He was like a little kid – he liked it, and he did not honestly understand why I didn’t. Free will, choice, freedom of exit or movement or what have you – they meant nothing to him, as far as I could tell. Just words.<br><br>As the multi-colored tents grew larger and larger in the distance, I was filled with a sense of foreboding – I didn’t want to get out. Brian changed the atmosphere around him – others seemed to relax, to be more cheerful, or at least more energetic. I… I felt the atmosphere change, but to me it only felt more oppressive. I wondered about him, sometimes, if he took me along because of that. Mostly, though, I just wished he hadn’t.<br><br>Unfortunately, he pulled into the gravel parking lot, and gave me another dazzling smile as he leapt out of the car. I followed him, reluctantly, like a woodchip pulled into the wake of a ferry, and we swept into the fairgrounds in the bustling crowd. It looked like things had just opened up – the ground was still clean, and the food and fun stands were mostly empty. The crowd spread out before us, and Brian immediately headed for one of the stands, grinning like a child. I followed him, more like the tortured parent in the equation.<br><br>“You, sir, look like a man who enjoys a good game of skill!”<br>The man stood there, tossing an oddly shaped ball from one hand to the other, an almost predatory glint in his eyes which seemed out of place in his round face, which appeared to be, otherwise, the very embodiment of good cheer.<br><br>Brian gave me one of his very cheeriest grins. I stared back at him. Undeterred, he fairly bounced over to the game, calling over his shoulder, “I’ll win you an animal! That’ll cheer you up!”<br><br>“Ah, to win an animal for the lovely lady, sir, you must win only three games – surely a simple feat for one so clearly accustomed to the masculine arts as yourself!”<br><br>Have you ever choked on air? It’s like choking on water, but when life throws something so unbelievably insane at you that you choke on the very substance which you are accustomed to breathing, because reality demands that you choke in disbelief, almost as if reality was a narrative of some sort. I mean, &#39;masculine arts&#39;? What was he going to do, wank towards a target, or just look big and strong and manly, maybe flex a couple times, or just kill something with a caveman stick... I don&#39;t know, something about the very phrase &#39;masculine arts&#39; conjures a pretty skeevy image. Maybe it&#39;s just me.<br><br>But the man only handed him one of the balls, which were a dark sort of coppery color. Brian gave him another cheery smile, which he returned-- or reflected, more like. A thin, faded image of the real thing, but just as nauseating. Maybe more so, actually. I watched as he pointed to the hoops which needed to be targeted, and the pyramids knocked down, and so on, and so forth. I concluded that &#39;masculine arts&#39; was just one of those things people say to patronize the girlfr-- the companion. Companion. Not girlfriend, not significant other, not even friend.<br><br>Companion was bad enough. In its own right, it held just as many irritating connotations as masculine, or even girlfriend, but it was truer than anything else. I don&#39;t know. Maybe prisoner? Unwilling companion-- no, that just sounded wrong.<br><br>&quot;Look! I almost won!&quot; He seemed so... enthusiastic. I fought back the smile and gave him a dirty look. &quot;One more try, and I&#39;ll get it! Which animal do you want?&quot;<br><br>The man, no longer oozing greasy charm, grinned at me as well, fully caught up. He handed Brian another ball from the crate. &quot;On the house, my good man, on the house! An animal for the lovely lady!&quot;<br><br>I shook my head at the pair of them, and the teenage kid who&#39;d wandered up behind him, androgynous, face three-quarters of the way hidden behind a curtain of hair that held a wave, despite the gallon and a half of gel attempting to hold it straight. He watched for a second, visibly tensing as Brian wound up for the throw. I kicked at the dust, noting the weird spirals it formed into, three-dimensional, like smoke, or a drop of ink in water... Sand in air, ink in water, cloud in empty space?<br><br>&quot;Name it, name it!&quot;<br><br>The three of them were all laughing now, like old friends. Brian tossed the ball back to the showman, an easy underhand throw, and the teenage kid clapped him on the back and wandered off into the crowd again. I&#39;d caught a glimpse. A girl, under the frayed, loose clothing and sexless piercings. Huh.<br><br>I looked at the little plushie zebra. It didn&#39;t seem to be smiling. In fact, it looked more or less like a regular zebra, a horse with stripes, complete with the intelligent, intense sort of face. Strangely enough, I liked it. I didn&#39;t want to name it and push it into this stupid scene. I shrugged.<br><br>&quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot; He looked down for a second. &quot;Thanks, though.&quot;<br><br>It&#39;s funny, from the sudden sparkle on his face, you&#39;d think he actually cared whether or not I liked it. Didn&#39;t he enjoy the game? The attention? The cameraderie? Maybe it wasn&#39;t cameraderie. Maybe they were just players in his game, maybe they were just fellow actors in the scene, almost captives, and it didn&#39;t count. Maybe I did feel bad for him. The ...ing psychopath.<br><br>&quot;Anyway, what do you want to eat? I&#39;m getting hungry, well, not really, but you probably are, and I feel like we should probably eat something while we&#39;re here, because the granola gets really old, or just boring, because it&#39;s like, even though it&#39;s nourishing and technically it won&#39;t go stale in the sealed packaging and it hasn&#39;t been that long anyway, I still get tired of the same texture over and over, and the taste isn&#39;t that great. So while we&#39;re out of the car, I kind of want something to eat that&#39;s not granola. Not that the granola&#39;s bad.&quot;<br><br>Really, you&#39;d think my mother had made the granola or something. Had she? I&#39;d remember that, though, and besides, her granola was way better than the stuff we&#39;d brought. It had raisins and pineapple, not these dates. Dates were good, the first one and second one, but more than two in a handful, every handful, and they just got to be too sweet. It left a bad taste on your mouth. He was looking at me somewhat expectantly, his eyes like a puppy&#39;s.<br><br>&quot;Alright, Brian. We&#39;ll go get something to eat. Where&#39;s the foodcourt?&quot;<br><br>He gestured, and set off with that same spring in his step. I followed him as he exchanged cheerful greetings with every damn person we passed, even in the crowds, and managed to nod to most of them without actually saying anything. Their eyes don&#39;t glide over me like they did when we started this stupid trip. ...When -he- started this trip. Not we. He. I didn&#39;t have a choice. I didn&#39;t start anything, just got sucked along. I hate how memory distorts things.<br><br>&quot;It all looks so good!&quot;<br><br>I looked at the big chalkboard. Corn dogs, popcorn (extra butter), fried dough, fried batter, fried doughnuts, batter-dipped cracklings (wait, what?), pork rinds, bacon-onion-battered-mushroom-nacho-ham-double-cheeseburger... I stopped reading about a quarter of the way down and stared at him. He was already exchanging blond jokes with the couple in front of us. I briefly wished I was blond so I could feel offended.<br><br>&quot;Do they have anything even remotely not poisonous?&quot;<br><br>He guffawed, as though I&#39;d made some hilarious joke, and pointed to the bottom of the menu. &quot;Look! They have fruit salad and stuff!&quot;<br><br>The couple stepped away, with a cheery wave, and the clerk looked us both over, somehow seemed to do a mental double-take without actually registering it in her conscious. &quot;What can I get you folks today?&quot;<br><br>Brian began chattering, of course, listing three or four things he wanted. I looked over the &quot;fruit salads,&quot; which, I saw from the counter, were mostly whipped cream with a handful of sugar-dipped berries thrown in. Eventually, the clerk finished talking to my benevolent dictator slash companion slash kidnapper and turned to me, a wide smile on her face.<br><br>&quot;I, um. This. Uh, Brian, this stuff all looks disgusting. No offense. Pick something off the fruit menu, I don&#39;t want to think about it anymore.&quot;<br><br>He gave me a slightly concerned glance, which would normally have been rather disconcerting, but for some reason, it just made me tired. Pointing to an item on the menu, he handed the clerk some money, and we stepped to the end of the counter.<br><br>&quot;Are you alright? You&#39;re... you&#39;re not acting right.&quot;<br><br>I stifled the strange impulse to laugh and shook my head. &quot;I&#39;m fine, Brian. Really.&quot; I looked down at the zebra, which contemplated me with its preternaturally (for a stuffed animal) intelligent expression, and winked at it. It did not wink back, which seemed to me impolite. I grinned. Brian, just out of the corner of my eye, looked alarmed.<br><br>&quot;Here&#39;s your meal! Enjoy the rest of your stay, folks!&quot;<br>He took the tray, looking at me instead of the clerk, strangely enough. &quot;You&#39;re not fine, though! You&#39;re not being sarcastic, or snide, or anything!&quot; He sounded like a panicked little kid. I grinned. I don&#39;t know why.<br><br>&quot;Ah, Brian. I&#39;m fine. It&#39;s a nice enough day. Let&#39;s go eat, eh?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I, I... okay. Okay, let&#39;s eat.&quot; His voice lacked the cheerful, over-confident, nearly strangling enthusiasm it usually possessed. <br><br>We wandered off to the picnic area, a stretch of lawn, fairly lush, under several decently sized trees, and found a little wicker table. I looked down at the dish he&#39;d picked out, and began to laugh.<br><br>Ah, life.</p>

            <p>It&#39;s good. It&#39;s very good. Someone already linked you to FictionPress, or I would have done it for you...<br><br>I don&#39;t quite understand why Brian seems to have this infective cheerful possession effect on random characters... Or the description of &quot;endlessly sepia-toned miles&quot;. It sounds rather like they&#39;re in some kind of barren alternate dimension.<br><br>Don&#39;t mind my brain, it&#39;s on fantasy setting. But that&#39;s what it sounds like... The title only makes it slightly clearer. You might want to explain in-story that they are, in fact, in Kansas, along with why they&#39;re in Kansas in the first place. I, for one, am confused.</p>

            <p>Have you ever read Neil Gaiman&#39;s Sandman series? There&#39;s a conversation in one of them about secrets and mysteries-- between Cain, the keeper of secrets, and Abel, the keeper of mysteries. I lent the book out (it&#39;s the one before The Kindly Ones, right?), so I can&#39;t quote directly, but the point is something to the effect of &quot;Giving away a mystery spoils it. People don&#39;t want answers, they want to wonder.&quot;<br><br>That&#39;s kind of what I was going for with this. I didn&#39;t explicitly state that they weren&#39;t in Kansas because the specific location of Kansas isn&#39;t really the point-- the point is, as you noticed, the barren sepia-toned... theme.<br><br>Anyway, the reason why I didn&#39;t go into detail about the hows and the whys of Brian&#39;s character is because I&#39;ve been trying for more subtlety in writing; it seems like the better stories, in my experience, are the ones where the writer lets you ask, lets you wonder, gives you room to draw conclusions. That&#39;s kind of what I was going for-- it&#39;s not really a fantasy story, more of... surrealism, I guess.</p>

            <p>Really, I don&#39;t. I didn&#39;t understand a lot of it...<br><br>It sounded like it had potential as a sort of fantasy/sci-fi/horror-maybe-sort-of-shaped-novel thing.

            <p>I wouldn&#39;t go as far as to call it a new fandom. The story of the film fits marvelously well with the 80s TV show. A lot of the TV show fans will go and see it (and A-Team seems to be on a continuous rerun loop). Although, wow, FFnet already has a movie category for it.<br><br>It always takes a little while for fic to pick up. Film&#39;s only been  out since the 11th (10th in the Netherlands), and won&#39;t be out until late July in Britain. Quite a few of the fic writers I know are from Britain.<br><br>I liked the film. After <i>Wanted</i> I was a little worried that the same authors would be writing the A-Team film, but I&#39;m pleased with what they came up with. It&#39;s a good genesis story for the A-Team (it basically tells the story of the Team before the start of the TV show, and solved that long mystery of why BA is wearing airborne insignia if he hates flying) and captures the humour of the show excellently.<br><br>For some reason I don&#39;t think much bad will happen to the fandom. But I am feeling rather protective of the new canon, and I&#39;ll keep my eye on the new category (and the old one and the archive) so badfic can be dealt with quickly.<br><br></p>

            <p>You watched <i>Wanted</i> too?  Oh my god.  I am so sorry.  The comic book was much better.  After ten minutes of watching the movie, I wanted to kill the writers...  <br>Yeah, the one fic that I saw last night was actually really good.  Short, but sweet and to the point (gummy worms, seriously? Never mind, just read the story.)<br>Oh, just you wait, Inde.  There will be scores upon scores of Face Murdock slash.  Any new fanbrats who watch this will pick up on at least half of the slashy &quot;clues&quot; that I found.  Hmmmm... *rubs chin and then smirks like Jim Carrey*  I can&#39;t wait until they try that.<br><br>Anyways, I think this set of writers did pretty well at their job (and hey, the show isn&#39;t as campy as I thought it would be!), and I am suitably impressed with the reimaginings of the characters, especially Murdock.<br>And Black<i>forest</i>? <b>Bwahahahah!</b> That is so funny--Black Water; I wonder when they&#39;ll start protesting the movie... Yeah, the Marine Corps and the Army in our &#39;verse hate those guys too.  Black Forest? <b>Bwahahahaha!</b> <br><br>-Honu_Wahine</p>

            <p>but I got told off for hackling. <br><br>I didn&#39;t really see the Face Murdock slash in the film. BA Murdock, sure. But I&#39;m not a slasher myself, so I probably don&#39;t see what is there.

            <p>I have to concede defeat.  My sister took me to see the movie today (yes, after almost two weeks, I&#39;m over my jet lag enough to go to a movie twice), and kept pointing out the slash between BA and Murdock (okay, and I noticed a bit more of it myself.  Especially the hospital scene at the beginning lol).<br><br>Still nothing new on the main section in the pit, but there&#39;s a crossover that has me scratching my head.  I can&#39;t figure out <i>what</i> it is the author&#39;s trying to cross the movie with.  <br><br>I call hack and incompetence. <br><br>-Honu_Wahine</p>

            <p>Perish the thought! Beside transfer options (as Jay and Acacia do in the original series), there&#39;s an entire <a>Freelance Division</a> of the Mary-Sue Department in which agents like mine take on &#39;Sues from all sorts of fandoms.

            <p>OK, I&#39;ve been encountering this issue somewhat often lately: Characters who are not, in canon, capable of falling in love for some reason or other, are wedged sideways and without explanation into romantic relationships.<br><br>For example: Peter Pan falls in love, without growing up and without any explanation other than that the Mary Sue is ridiculously beautiful and can out-fight the Villain of the Day. Sorry, but it&#39;s been tried with both Tinkerbell and Wendy, and neither one managed it... Similarly, I&#39;ve seen very young children forced into romance that&#39;s got more in common with cheap romance novels than with cute puppy love.<br><br>Other examples include teen and adult characters who are canonically established not to have a sex drive, and are put into romantic relationships with little or no explanation as to why they&#39;re suddenly interested. It&#39;s especially irritating if they&#39;re &quot;married&quot; to something else, like their job for example, and they just randomly ditch their former passion for their love interest.<br><br>I&#39;m asking about whether this is a badfic trait, because I&#39;m a bit biased--I&#39;m asexual and very aware of the fact that it is quite possible to be happily uninvolved in romance, and I get more than a little annoyed when the few examples of such characters have that unique trait destroyed exclusively because the author wants the character to be involved in a romance, with little or no explanation given for why the character is suddenly interested in getting it on with either Mary Sue or whoever the author&#39;s decided to slash them with today...</p>

            <p>It&#39;s the main reason I don&#39;t read slash. Well, also because slash has a tendency to get graphic, and that just squicks me out. But it&#39;s one of the big reasons.<br><br>Romance is hard. A lot of people don&#39;t think it is, but romance is very, very hard to write in a plausible way. At least for me it is. Many of the people in the Pit think they can write romance, when they really can&#39;t and should never even be allowed near someone else&#39;s canon. But then again, that&#39;s what we&#39;re here for...<br><br>My personal pet peeve is when a young protagonist is arbitrarily paired with his/her father figure/mentor. Say, Luke Skywalker/Obi-wan Kenobi, or--I actually found a fic with this pairing the other day--Mr. Miyagi/Daniel. Eurgh. Not only is it squicky for age reasons, it destroys a perfectly good nonromantic relationship.</p>

            <p>But even if a character doesn&#39;t have a love interest in canon, that doesn&#39;t mean they don&#39;t want romance ever. Life isn&#39;t divided into &quot;asexual&quot; and &quot;sex-crazed,&quot; and although yeah, you can&#39;t make someone just ditch their canonical passion, that doesn&#39;t preclude the possibility of romance. The first example that comes to mind is Lightning from FFXIII, who has no real love interest and didn&#39;t have much of a life outside her military career, but defrosts over the story and could conceivably end up with somebody. On the other hand, if it&#39;s someone who <i> can&#39;t </i> feel or can&#39;t love, like Peter Pan, I am totally with you.</p>

            <p>In some of my fandoms, established asexuals are always forced into romance, just because the Suethor fancies the actor, or thinks it would be &#39;really cute&#39; if two characters got together. That does make it badfic in my opinion, because they are out of character - we have the Department of Bad Slash dealing with people turning heterosexual characters homosexual (amongst other things)so maybe that should be included in there?</p>

            <p>I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a more specific charge than OOCness, but OOCness alone can qualify something as a badfic, so I suppose that&#39;s an answer to your question. <br><br>In terms of missions, perhaps one of your agents could make a specific point of complaining about or taking missions that have this particular flaw (or, more likely, the Flowers send said agent on such missions just because it&#39;s sure to drive them mad)? </p>

            <p>And I think it is. It seems to be a trait of badfic writers to think that asexuality doesn&#39;t exist, and it&#39;s just the matter of finding the &quot;right&quot; person. (Or they&#39;ve never heard of it, which amounts to the same thing.) As a slash writer myself, I can&#39;t be too critical, as my writing tends to take assumed heterosexual male characters and pair them with other assumed heterosexual male characters, but I do try to make note of that and explore at least a little why they&#39;re in danger of changing their assumed orientations. <br><br>Anyway, to stop rambling, I think it is a charge and a common trait. It&#39;s also lazy. Puppy-love is wonderfully cute when it&#39;s well done, but it&#39;s Gods&#39; awfully hard to do well. Mithros knows I&#39;ve tried...<br><br>--anamia</p>

            <p>Okay, so we have an animated canon. In it, human biology does not work exactly the same way as it does in real life. For example, brain damage causes one&#39;s hair to turn blue, and the blue-haired guy&#39;s children inherited it even though it wasn&#39;t genetic; nobody thinks green skin is worthy of any sort of comment; the best way to bring someone out of a coma is to hit them with a car; and it&#39;s possible to survive drinking several bottles of rum per day for months on end. However, the characters do seem to react to consumption of various substances in a fairly similar way to normal humans, though to a far lesser extent; the aforementioned several-bottles-of-rum-per-day gets the drinker incredibly drunk but has yet to kill him, and another character is perpetually stoned on amounts of pain medication which also would probably kill a real human.<br><br>There is a fic in this fandom which, while pretty bad in other ways, featured a rescue scene which left me WTFing. See, the Sue suffers a gunshot wound. So, to save her, our heroes inject deadly nightshade into her. And it works. Instantly. To the point that the wound instantly closes up, she wakes from unconsciousness and is immediately able to sit up and talk.<br><br>Now, by normal standards, this fails. However, I&#39;m not sure whether the aforementioned canonical oddities would affect the severity of the charge. They have yet to be able to do this in canon, and as I said, I&#39;m pretty sure they react to substances in something resembling a logical way (&quot;logical&quot; by cartoon standards, but still, you can at least usually see where they got the idea). Anyone have any thoughts?<br><br>Also, I&#39;m transferring my missions and MSTings off my personal website onto my new Dreamwidth blog: <a href="http://rc88.dreamwidth.org"><a href="http://rc88.dreamwidth.org">http://rc88.dreamwidth.org</a></a>. It&#39;ll take me a while to get everything coded up and posted, but a couple things are up already. Missions won&#39;t be going down from my site for a while, but I thought I should tell people now.</p>

            <p>In the same fic, the characters barge into the emergency room and inject an unidentified substance into the patient in front of several doctors, none of whom actually make any attempt to stop them. They also don&#39;t get dragged out when the Sue apparently &quot;dies&quot; for a few seconds in order to create dramatic tension before her instant recovery, even though as far as the doctors would know they&#39;ve just attempted to murder her, and if they get arrested the doctors would be arrested as well for letting them do so. In real life, this also fails. However, we&#39;re talking about a continuum in which three guys living in a zombie-infested building were allowed to keep an eight-year-old girl they found in a box with no legal difficulty at all, and in which a person like Murdoc Niccals (a self-absorbed petty criminal and Satan worshipper) was in fact <i>forced</i> by a community service order to look after a coma patient. So, y&#39;know, distinct Somebody Else&#39;s Problem infection throughout the population. Still, the canon seems to run on the Rule of Awesome and the Rule of Funny, and this doesn&#39;t really fall into that category (except unintentionally in the latter case). So, still a charge, or not?</p>

            <p>Nobody in canon has taken nightshade onscreen, so I can&#39;t compare, and they don&#39;t seem AS affected by various substances as normal people would be, but they&#39;re still affected in a similar way; e.g. one character has been perpetually drunk for at least six months and hasn&#39;t died, but the alcohol got him drunk, it did not give him the ability to fly or anything. And the painkillers another character is addicted to help the migraines he got from the car accidents he&#39;s been in but don&#39;t, for example, heal up the scars. Therefore, it&#39;s never been tested in canon but I&#39;m pretty certain deadly nightshade shouldn&#39;t do anything except kill them. They do operate on cartoon biology, but with cartoon biology, even if it&#39;s not accurate you can <i>sort of</i> see where they got the idea for what it does do. The nightshade thing is a bit random. I just thought I should ask to make sure.<br><br>The fandom is Gorillaz, in case you don&#39;t know: <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2749666/1/Finding_Fate"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2749666/1/Finding_Fate">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2749666/1/Finding_Fate</a></a></p>

            <p>In LotR, you often see Suethors assuming that athelas is a cure-all. Well, it&#39;s a pretty handy plant to have around, especially if you&#39;re in the company of Aragorn and/or fighting Ringwraiths; but it&#39;s not by any means the only item you&#39;ll ever need in your Middle-earth first aid kit. <br><br>You can charge for that--especially if it&#39;s obvious that the author just used athelas because s/he was too lazy to research actual herbal medication and practical field medicine of the sort that might actually be useful for a LotR character.<br><br>Similarly, if the author takes an aspect of canon and stretches it out of shape, that counts as a charge.</p>

If it is a troll, they&#39;re being just subtle enough to raise questions.

            <p>Just saw it yesterday. Thought it was decent. Took too much off the original, though, and Mr. Miyagi is still awesomer than Jackie Chan.<br><br>So what d&#39; y&#39;all think of the remake? Good? Bad? How does it compare to the original? IMO, the original was way better, but I doubt everyone agrees.<br><br>And, since I&#39;m thinking about it, how do we feel about spinoffs and remakes, like this? Do they fit into the canon? Do they alter the canon? Do they make their own canon? I&#39;d say the first or last option.</p>

            <p>Before I start editing mercilessly to throw these four into the list, I want to run them past you guys to make sure I&#39;ve found material worth PPCing. I myself have only skimmed each of these, which is primarily why I must ask for the more experienced sporks to take a poke at them...<br><br>Not in that way, of course. I&#39;d be more worried for your collective sanity than I already am if that was the case.<br><br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6058826/1/Warfare_High_School"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6058826/1/Warfare_High_School">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6058826/1/Warfare_High_School</a></a> - Warfare High School. Already sounds promising, doesn&#39;t it? Call of Duty 4 / MW2 crossover, placing lead characters from both games in an appallingly punctuated high-school setting. So far I haven&#39;t even brought myself to finish chapter one, but I&#39;m guessing some awful excuse for drama ensues soon enough; especially with Ghost hitting on a meek little girl named Alexandra...<br><br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6060924/1/son_of_dante"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6060924/1/son_of_dante">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6060924/1/son_of_dante</a></a> - Click this link. I dare you. Not a shred of smut, thankfully, but you need only skim this marvellous piece of garbage to understand - perhaps more fully than is really necessary - why it deserves sporking in some creative fashion or another.<br><br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6007699/1/The_Fox_and_The_HalfBreed"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6007699/1/The_Fox_and_The_HalfBreed">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6007699/1/The_Fox_and_The_HalfBreed</a></a> - Pending a more detailed read, which I&#39;m dreading, I can thus far barely make sense of this one. What I can gather is an overall poor grasp of punctuation, too many poorly-described characters to bother trying to keep track of, and use of the names of characters from a few existing animes (Szayel and Sesshoumaru stand out).<br><br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6028348/1/Nero_and_Dantes_obsession_with_fanfiction"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6028348/1/Nero_and_Dantes_obsession_with_fanfiction">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6028348/1/Nero_and_Dantes_obsession_with_fanfiction</a></a> - NeroxDante slash; only the first chapter is up right now. Admittedly well written and punctuated, but it remains to be seen how the pairing itself will be handled. Might want to keep tabs on this one.</p>

            <p>Well, it would be but the story seems to be down.<br><br>On the subject of adding unclaimed fic:<br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5811848/1/Artemis_Fowl_and_the_Time_Lord"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5811848/1/Artemis_Fowl_and_the_Time_Lord">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5811848/1/Artemis_Fowl_and_the_Time_Lord</a></a> Poorly explained, Artemis, Foaly and The Doctor get into a &quot;who&#39;s smarter&quot; competition, by going to the limit of Pi. (Pi, of course, has no limit.) Holly is talking Artemis&#39; parents, with no regard for Fairy Secrecy.<br><br>And that&#39;s half way through the first chapter. Things can only get worse. Unlikely Crossovers, I give this one to you. </p>

            <p>Well, Naruto and Bleach. But they&#39;re obvious. I read Deathnote ages ago, and am collecting Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle and Mahou Sensei Negima at the moment. Right at this moment I&#39;m reading Fairy Tail. I&#39;m open to any recommendations, of course!<br>*breathe*</p>

            <p>I don&#39;t like the Big Three much (Naruto, One Piece, and Bleach) but Death Note was amazing.<br><br>Reccomendations? Well, I have to say Hikaru no Go. It&#39;s drawn by Takeshi Obata, the same person who drew Death Note, but the author&#39;s different. I love it. Contesting for my favorite manga...<br><br>If you&#39;re reading Tsubasa, I&#39;d recommend xxxHOLIC, the sister series--assuming you haven&#39;t read it already. It&#39;s good.</p>

            <p>We&#39;re not supposed to hate on the authors, I know, but with this guy, it&#39;s REALLY REALLY HARD not to. Particularly since <i>all</i> of his fics are equally creepy, though with most of them we are at least spared the babytalk and cat ears.<br><br>Someone on LJ summarised his work thus: &quot;So, according to him, Sakura is too stupid, weak, and sexual (because clearly her crush on Sasuke makes her bad, therefore sexual woman = evil slut), so having her be tortured to death by her crush is somehow striking a blow for women everywhere.&quot; (Yes, the guy has apparently openly expressed this view.) &quot;Meanwhile, he casts Naruto as feminine, but his idea of femininity is Naruto being weak, stupid, and sexual, exactly the same things he despises Sakura for. The only difference appears to be that Naruto has a penis and Sakura doesn&#39;t. Meanwhile, as if this wasn&#39;t bad enough, he casts Sasuke as the icon of masculinity, so ... his idea of masculinity is someone who tortures and kills women because he hates them and they deserve to die, and who rapes and tortures the &#39;pure&#39; feminine boy on the pretext of loving him.&quot;</p>

            <p>Mass execution sounds good. Lots of fire, maybe? Burn them on the stake (Maybe by Agents from the Naruto continuum using a Fire jutsu?) like heretics they are? And as they&#39;re not real kittens, I don&#39;t think you have to worry about nine lives.<br>But maybe you could lock them up, incapacitated, together with No-Drool videos, and watch them die from sexual withdrawal? I know torturing is frowned upon, but it seems like poetic justice to have oversexed kittens die from watching porn and sexual frustration?<br>But maybe that&#39;s too &#39;Ick&#39;...<br>Hmm... I do have a few ideas, though some the Flowers probably would object to, and some are almost as squicky as the fic...

            <p>... being a Mossflower vermin, he makes his lutestrings out of actual catgut. (Yes, I know in the real world catgut is actually sheep gut. Close enough for government work.) However, I don&#39;t think that&#39;s painful enough for them. Since they&#39;re Sues and could possibly survive a lot more damage than a normal being (plenty of Sues recover at unfeasible speeds from life-threatening injuries) maybe he could gut them before the proper execution, since whatever we do to them is likely to ruin the intestines beyond usefulness. We thought about drowning them, since that&#39;s what one traditionally does with unwanted cats, but again, not painful enough. And Drake&#39;s idea in Part 2 is a) unlikely to actually work and b) disconcerting to say the least, so no-go there.</p>

You could for example choose an essay you wrote for school which you are very proud of.<br>Then the Permission Givers will either give you Permission or not, in which case they will explain what you lack in their eyes.<br><br>About new recruits: It depends. Whoever rescued them from a fic has the ultimate say in things. Go ask them.<br><br>To exorcise Video Game badfics you need a CD-ROM or something similar with the game on it (Canon Material), and depending on you, candles, bells, chimes, incense and the like. The character to be exorcised is hit with the Canon Material and variations of &quot;Get thee out! The power of (original author) compels you!&quot; until the Author-Wraith appears and is charged and slain.<br>To handle missions in continua, you need a working kwnowledge of them. I am not sure if you have to play them, but I don&#39;t think so. You just have to be able to tell what&#39;s Canon and what isn&#39;t.<br><br>I hope this helps. The wiki is also a good place to look for answers.</p>

            <p>Traditionally, people write the scene in which their agents get to know each other/meet for the first time for their writing sample, but you don&#39;t need to. And it doesn&#39;t need to be brilliant.

            <p>I&#39;ve been wondering about that bit actually, because as you don&#39;t scritly have permission to publish something based in the PPC-Verse yet, a sample where your agents meet doesn&#39;t fit.<br>In fact, my first PPC-Fic is more likely to be my agents meeting ending as the alarm goes.

            <p>...then no, it&#39;s not allowed. But in practice, it&#39;s done often, and actually preferred by the permission givers because it shows that you can write in the spirit and style of the PPC.

            <p>Here&#39;s my request for permission. I am so nervous. <br><br>Agent Joseph Trevor <br>Age: 19<br>Home Continuum: World One<br>Department: Floaters<br>Species: Human<br>Height: 5’ 6”<br>Hair: Black<br>Eyes: Green<br>Weapon Preference: anything rope-like (usually chains), flails, sledgehammer<br>Lust-Object(s): Kallen Kozuki (AKA Kallen Stadtfeld), Rosalina, Samus Aran.<br><br>Appearance: A caucasian male with a usually build and normal limbs. His black hair tend to be messy and often obscures the back of his neck.  His attire consists of a black worker shirt with a Floaters flashpatch, goggles (*usually on his hat), a plumber&#39;s cap, a jacket, overalls, a tool belt, and boots. He sometimes wear a leather jacket.<br><br>Personality: Joseph is best described as a childish pervert and somewhat of a comedian. His quality of jokes may vary and they tend to be groan-worthy, especially during missions. Dispite this behavior, he&#39;s extremely good in video games and very knowledgable in gaming and anime. Many people wondered how this immature dude got into a university. When partnered with Centurio, he tends to annoy the robot, either directly or indirectly. <br><br>Agent Centurio <br>Age: 5<br>Home Continuum: Superior Defender Gundam Force (Neotopia to be precise)<br>Floaters:<br>Species: Robot (Combat Mobile Citizen to be precise)<br>Height: 4&#39; 9&#39;<br>Hair: N/A<br>Eyes: Red<br>Weapon Preference: Swords, Guns<br>Lust-Object(s): Angleyne, XJ9, Splash Woman.<br><br>Appearance: He looks a lot like a short and stubby Hyaku Shiki from Zeta Gundam. Because he can&#39;t wear clothing, his body painted black with thin red strips on his arms and legs. The only clothing he wears is an army beret with the DF Flashpatch on it. <br><br>Personality: Centurio has a persona of businessman, a spoof of robots being mindless drones. He usually acted all professional and snarky. Due to his personality, some view him as cold and uncaring but his inner campassion contradict his coldness. His fandoms are mostly fantasy oriented, which was unusual. He&#39;s secretly a Harry Potter fanboy but when people pointed it out, he tried to deny that. Sometimes, he&#39;ll make up conspiracy theories which were usually ridiculous in content. Much to his dismay, he has put up with Joseph&#39;s antics.<br><br>My writing sample is on this link: <a href="http://sneezier.livejournal.com/602.html"><a href="http://sneezier.livejournal.com/602.html">http://sneezier.livejournal.com/602.html</a></a></p>

            <p>Permission-getting isn&#39;t scary, I promise. Even in the worst-case scenario, that of being outright rejected with a list of areas of improvement, it&#39;s only a question of working on your problems and re-applying. We all <i>want</i> to give everyone Permission, you know - it&#39;s not an exclusive club.<br><br>In any case, I&#39;m afraid I can&#39;t give you a firm answer today as I&#39;m in a hurry today and have no time to read your sample, but as a PG, the first thing I notice is that you have a few tense and punctuation issues in your request (&quot;Neotopia<b>[no comma]</b> to be precise&quot;; &quot;Centurio <b>has</b> a persona of businessman, a spoof of robots being mindless drones. He usually <b>acted</b> all&quot;), as well as one glaring typo (&quot;c<b>a</b>mpassion&quot;), the former of which I believe has been mentioned below. This doesn&#39;t bode well. Obviously, you can&#39;t edit the post anymore, but based on this, I would hesitate to give you Permission without knowing you&#39;ll have a beta-reader to work with, at least for your first few missions.<br><br>From what I see here in the profiles, your agents look fine; nothing too extreme and a fair amount of contrast between them, which could lead to some funny situations. My only negative-ish comment there is that I feel like I&#39;ve seen these character descriptions before; is this your first Permission request? Because if so, there&#39;s someone who has very similar agents to you, and that&#39;s probably not much fun. Your agents will gain more individual quirks as you write them, of course, but at this point the most interesting thing I see is Joseph being described as a &quot;pervert&quot; - so perhaps you&#39;ll want to give them a little more individuality. You don&#39;t have to do so right now, though - not to get Permission. They&#39;re just fine for that.<br><br><br>Sorry again that I don&#39;t have time to read your writing sample and make an official decision - I&#39;ll try to come back and do so later if no other PG steps in, but I have a busy week ahead. Feel free to nag the others or repost your request in a week or so if no one has time (or I forget - it happens) to give a proper answer. </p>

<li>Tenses are a property of verbs; so you need to be able to pick out the verb in a sentence. If you can&#39;t do that, I suggest googling it and learning.<br><br>2. Once you know where the verbs are, determine your tense.<br>Present tense (something that&#39;s happening right now): &quot;The cat sits on the chair.&quot;<br>Past tense (something that&#39;s already happened): &quot;The cat sat on the chair.&quot;<br>Future tense (something that will happen): &quot;The cat will sit on the chair.&quot;<br><br>(There are also past perfect, present perfect, and future perfect tenses. They&#39;re not as important; basically, they&#39;re used for describing what has been happening at some point in time, rather than what is happening.)<br><br>You may actually look up verbs in the dictionary. They have the tenses listed there.<br><br>Mainly, though, at this point if you&#39;re going to write anything, you NEED a beta. It will probably take you a good few months to nail down tenses properly, especially with a learning disability in that area. It&#39;s very much like a dyslexic writer: You&#39;re going to have to learn as much as you can yourself, and then get a very good editor to catch what you can&#39;t.</li>

            <p>The only problem I had with this, is that I am not familiar at all with the canon, so I was often trying to figure out who was being referred to, and how they were related to each other.  I had no idea that Lindsey was a teenager until the end where it said she should have been in school.  I am guessing that she is the daughter of Wendy?<br><br>I don&#39;t know how you could work in a line or two about who is who without getting into &quot;As you know, Bob...&quot; since both of your agents know the canon.<br><br>I liked the interactions between Ian and Lee.  The opening banter about blowing up an attacking house was great, but I did have a little trouble following who was the Sue, who were the canons and everybody&#39;s relationships to each other, which made it a little hard to fully enjoy the mission.</p>

            <p>Okay,Crash course- Lindsay is Catherine Willow&#39;s daughter, who the writers of the show tend to forget unless its either a) a throw-away line or b) crucial to the plot at the moment. They recently had an episode where she figured somewhat-heavily into the plot (a dead body was found at her high school), and she looked to be in her senior year, thus why she&#39;s in her junior year of high school in the &#39;Sue-fic, and therefore the mission, since the &#39;Sue-fic was set in 2009.<br><br>I&#39;m slightly confused by your second point, in that I&#39;m not sure what you&#39;re trying to say.

            <p>I haven&#39;t been here anywhere near long enough to post things yet, but planning is a wonderful thing. Where&#39;s the best place to post missions? Most I see are on livejournal, but I don&#39;t have an account there... does it even matter?<br>Thanks.</p>

            <p>As you&#39;ve noted, there&#39;s LJ, but some people (Trojie comes to mind)have been using Dreamwidth, which is like LJ. There&#39;s also the option of using Freewebs or a similar free web site hosting service. Really, it&#39;s up to you, so long as it&#39;s accessible to everyone else. Also, whatever&#39;s easiest for you to use. LJ and Dreamwidth are free to sign up for, and they have the added bonus of allowing other people to comment on the entries, whereas a webpage might not have that option.</p>

            <p>I had read your mission in the google doc and made some comments in it, I believe before you posted it as a mission. That is, I started before you announced the mission. If I calculate the time difference correctly, my reading and commenting on the mission coincided with you posting the mission. Which explains why none of my comments or corrections was reflected / showed in the posted mission. <br><br>So, uhm, I guess my review of this mission can be found in your google doc. ;-)</p>

            <p>So, I took into consideration what you said, and quite a bit of it made sense. I fixed what I thought were the most glaring errors- charging in front of canons, etc,- and put the revised version on LJ.</p>

            <p>Hey, I ran the message through an ETAOIN SHRDLU code breaker (and Google), and this is what I know/have:<br>• These aren’t scrambled letters<br>• It might be a substitution cipher, but probably not. <br>• If it is, this is a chart of the most probable substitutions (left side = original letter, right side = possible letters it stands for). <br>o U – E<br>o K – N/S/H/R<br>o I – N/S/H/R<br>o C – N/S/H/R<br>o W – T/A<br>o R – D/L/U/C/M<br>o A – T/A<br>o B – N/S/H/R<br>o S – D/L/U/C/M<br>o N – O/I<br>o T – D/L/U/C/M<br>o O – D/L/U /C/M<br>o X – O/I<br>o F – D/L/U/C/M<br>• Using this key, I’ve gotten nothing but gibberish so far, but I haven’t tried all the combinations yet. Any who want to try their hand at code breaking can feel free to play around with it.<br>• All that said, it’s more likely a CHED (Constructed Homophonic English Dialect) than anything else, although I can’t seem to crack it. I’ve looked on Google as well and have found a number of people who seem to speak it, but refuse to talk about what the nine hells it is. These people are:<br>o <a href="http://ace-duce12.deviantart.com/"><a href="http://ace-duce12.deviantart.com/">http://ace-duce12.deviantart.com/</a></a><br>o <a href="http://www.flickr.com/people/sprytaen/"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/people/sprytaen/">http://www.flickr.com/people/sprytaen/</a></a><br>o <a href="http://nousername08.deviantart.com/"><a href="http://nousername08.deviantart.com/">http://nousername08.deviantart.com/</a></a><br>o <a href="http://edorisuke.deviantart.com/"><a href="http://edorisuke.deviantart.com/">http://edorisuke.deviantart.com/</a></a><br>• These are all I’ve found, but there are probably others.<br>EBW<br></p>

            <p>I have a bad habit of using unnecessary acronyms. It means an dialect constructed artificially (wasn&#39;t created by a natural process) based on English homophones (2 = to and too, u = you, etc). Basically it&#39;s an overly complicated way of saying leetspeek (bad spelling intended).</p>
