            <p>Recently, my classmate has been insulting the PPC. She mocks my decision to join it and she makes it seem like I&#39;ve done something stupid. It&#39;s not - I really don&#39;t regret joining the Protectors. But I don&#39;t quite know how to reply without planting her a facer. Here are (some of) the things that she&#39;s been saying to me (and if you&#39;re particularly protective of the PPC, please do not read below):<br><br>&quot;What gives you the right to insult writers? They might be trying their best to write. And they might be four or five when they wrote the story. Yes, I know that FF.net requires a minimum age of thirteen, but their parents might have helped them post the story. And also, (in reference to the FAQ:FOR OTHER PEOPLE) how do you know that you&#39;re saving them from future humiliation? You could be humiliating them NOW, and it&#39;s not helping shape them into better writers.&quot; Among other things.<br><br>Would anybody be inclined to help out a bit with explaining? I&#39;m not PPC-expert, so I&#39;m hoping that somebody with more experience could intervene.<br><br>This is her FF.net account: <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/u/1821682/Topaz_and_Ruby"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/u/1821682/Topaz_and_Ruby">http://www.fanfiction.net/u/1821682/Topaz_and_Ruby</a></a><br><br>Thank you in advance, and sorry for such a dismal post at the beginning of the new year.<br><br>~X.B.</p>

            <p>Looking at her favorites... reasoning with her may be quite difficult. <br><br>The point is to A) have fun B) spork. We make goodfic out of badfic by writing about the badfic in a way that is (hopefully) instructive, funny, and good.

People.<br><br>ULTIMATELY, if she is your friend, try to find a way around the subject so you can still enjoy her company without ending up frustrated and upset.

            <p>A point that will never be stated enough is that we are in pursuit of badfics. Bad fics. And bad is very often an understatement. We do not mock everybody&#39;s fics, but only the ones so badly done, they deserve to.<br><br>For example, there is a list of what I sporked:<br>Mission 1: A badly written fic in which canon characters and plot are in basckground. It talks about the love story of two OCs. Nothing else. Sorry, that&#39;s not what a fanfiction is supposed to be.<br>Mission 2 (currently in beta status): A rapefic with horrible writing and wildly OOC characters. It&#39;s what we can call a canon rape. You&#39;re not a fan if you try to destroy the canon. At all.<br>Mission 3 (currently in the works): My own badly-written unreleased earlier stories. Well, I&#39;m actually mocking myself!<br>MST 1: A very badly written crossover with mashed grammar and no plot at all. If you want to write something, please put a little effort in it.<br><br>As everybody can see, the bad writing is a constant. We do not mock things we don&#39;t like. We mock things that deserve it.</p>

            <p>&#39;A fanfiction&#39; actually can be purely OC-based. I&#39;m sorry to have to be the one to make you aware of this, but sometimes fanfics can be more about exploring different aspects of the canon world than they are about the canon characters. They might use an era of the canon world in which there are very few canon characters and want to present their ideas on how that era might have seemed, or it might be about how &#39;the other people&#39; deal with what goes on in canon.<br>That doesn&#39;t mean a story might not be badly written. But being OC-based does not make it bad in and of itself.</p>

            <p>What I was trying to say, it was bad not because it was OC-based, but because it actually wasn&#39;t related to canon at all. Love story between two OCs. They get to know canon characters, yes, but actually the plot of Card Captor Sakura was just vaguely mentioned and the few characters involved were quite OOC.<br><br>I think that OC main characters can work, but if the story is so OC-based that you can change a few names and it becomes a fanfiction of another thing it&#39;s only a poorly disguised original fiction (And if you need to disguise your original fiction as a fanfic, think about it. There&#39;s something wrong). Quoting one of my agents, &quot;if it were a Detective Conan fic it would have been exactly the same cursed thing!&quot;, because the one I sporked it was not based on CCS at all. Just the names of the (almost background) characters and the town.</p>

            <p>If Suethors and badfic writers don&#39;t demonstrate a genuine love and respect for the canon stories, we won&#39;t demonstrate love and respect for <i>their</i> stories. Respect goes both ways, people. They just don&#39;t like it when we do the same kind of thing to their fics that they do to stories they <u>claim to be fans of.</u><br><br>At least <i>we</i> never claim to be fans of their fics!<br><br>If they <i>do</i> love the canon, it will show in their writing. If it doesn&#39;t show, they either lack the skill necessary to post a story for the world to read, or they are not genuine fans and really shouldn&#39;t be writing fanfiction in a public place.<br><br>That&#39;s what fanfiction.net is, after all--a public place. It&#39;s not remedial writing. It&#39;s not a workshop. It&#39;s not a self-esteem class. It&#39;s not a friends-only livejournal. What <i>isn&#39;t</i> fair is for fanfiction.net&#39;s <i>worst</i> writers to attempt to make that public place more comfortable for them--and them only--by attacking the right of a reader to leave negative feedback. This is especially true because it is <i>explicitly stated in the Terms of Service</i> that any author who posts to fanfiction.net should be able to accept criticism. <br><br>Speaking of rule-breaking, the &quot;four or five year old&quot; scenario was the most ridiculous part of your classmate&#39;s argument. &quot;Their parents might have helped these kids break the rules, so why don&#39;t you go easy on them?&quot; Um...so we&#39;re supposed to <i>reward</i> people for breaking rules made for the benefit of the fanfiction community as a whole? And you think that THAT would help these kids? <br><br>No. One of the most important lessons young children need to learn is that rules are in place for a reason. If their parents are enabling them to break the rules, the least we can do is demonstrate to them why those rules are in place. Better they learn from  a Sue-mocking community than from an obscene troll or an explicit story wrongly rated.<br><br>As to, &quot;What gives you the right to insult the writers?&quot; I answer, &quot;The same thing that gives the writers the right to create fanfiction in the first place.&quot;<br><br>~Araeph</p>

            <p>Don&#39;t apologise, hon - this is why we&#39;re a community, after all; we help each other. No better way to start the new year than to reaffirm what we&#39;re all here for. <br>(That said, reading all the other comments, I think it&#39;s safe to say that no one here is going to be able to intervene - give advice, yes, but you&#39;re going to have to work this out with her yourself. We can&#39;t literally step in, or she&#39;s likely to accuse us of bullying or somewhat.)<br><br>So, let me see...<br><br>Well, first of all, insults are not a hard science. Someone could be insulted if you describe their shirt as purple rather than blue, and some writers will be insulted by comments, criticism or parodies that others laugh at. Just because she would be insulted by something does not mean that everyone would, so she can&#39;t make a universal claim there. <br><br>Second, and probably my most important rebutta: Parodies exist. They are part of life and no one has the right to tell anyone they can&#39;t make a parody. Everything from parody movies to teenagers laughing about something as they come out of a cinema can be considered parody. As her if it&#39;s possible that there&#39;s absolutely nothing in the world that she has ever, in her life, made fun of. I doubt it. If we were all to go through life carefully tip-toeing around anything that might possibly offend someone, we&#39;d never say anything at all.<br><br>On the same lines, following what IndeMaat said - there&#39;s a quote I have which I think sums up the matter nicely (though I&#39;m afraid I&#39;ve lost the citation): &quot;It&#39;s amazing how many people think the right to freedom of speech means the right to be free of criticism for that speech, which would deny others the same right they claim for themselves.&quot; Unless she wants to argue that people should <i>never</i> write anything deconstructing another person&#39;s fictional work - which would make the entire notion of fanfic immoral and to be banned - then she can&#39;t use this point as more than a mild supporting paragraph.<br><br>Also, as Cassie said, she might be getting defensive of her own work, if only subconsciously. Someone who resorts to mocking you certainly doesn&#39;t sound like someone who has enough self-confidence to take things calmly without feeling the need to lash out at percieved attackers. It might help to reassure her that the PPC only goes after the absolute worst stories out there (presuming, of course, that hers don&#39;t qualify. And if they do, I suggest you pretend they don&#39;t - that won&#39;t do anyone any good). <br><br>I won&#39;t even go into the whole child-writers angle, because the others have covered that already. FFN and LJ and all them have rules for a reason; it&#39;s not our fault if someone chooses to break them. If they want to be treated as adults (well, teenagers, at least), then they have to be willing to take the bad with the good, and that means public posting = public criticism. The world can be harsh. Live with it. This isn&#39;t school, where children/teens are pampered and parents pay to let them pass classes. <br><br>Sorry for making this a laundry list of support points, but Aster Corbett&#39;s right, too; if someone were to write a PPC mission that was truly cruel, we&#39;d step in. We&#39;re not a sniggering group of bullies who will support each other blindly. <br><br>On the humiliation point - yes, true, it&#39;s very likely that anyone who finds their work has been PPCd will be humiliated. I&#39;m sure I would. First of all, we don&#39;t actively go up to writers and say &quot;We&#39;ve made fun of your dreadful writing!&quot; We keep it low-key and post in places that really only other PPCers are likely to find it; we&#39;re a very closed community in that sense. Second, such things happen. It&#39;s life. We all get humiliated sometimes, and anyone who gets to the age of twenty without at least one absolutely dreadful shameful episode hasn&#39;t experienced enough of life to be properly living it. Tough though it is, it&#39;s good for us - even the people who take it in the worst way possible and wail, &quot;I&#39;ll never write again!&quot; They might think that now and change their minds later, or maybe it&#39;s true, in which case they&#39;ll undoubtedly find something else to make themselves happy. We are not their parents, teachers, or friends - we are not obliged to make their lives turn out perfectly. They have to do that themselves, and that means putting in effort rather than expecting the world to coddle them. Certainly, fanfic and fandom are fun, a hobby - I consider it such - but fun and effort are not mutually exclusive.<br><br><br>On a slightly different note, I&#39;d advise you to be very careful about how you present your argument, because I expect that even if every point you make is perfect and you punch holes in every one of her arguments, she&#39;s not going to take it well - no one likes to be so thoroughly proven wrong. Most I&#39;ve seen will respond with more and more feeble (or angry) protests; how many times do you really see someone meekly bwo their heads and say &quot;You&#39;re totally right, I was wrong, please forgive me, I feel so bad...&quot; ?  Not many, and she doesn&#39;t sound like the type. A heafty dose of &quot;I think&quot; and &quot;well, to <i>me</i>...&quot; phrases should help. Use the plural if you need to (&quot;we don&#39;t think of ourselves as mean...&quot;), but try avoiding stating it like fact, because that will probably just make her deaf to your actual words.<br><br>Last, though I hate to say it, you may not be able to convince her. It happens. I hope she&#39;s not someone you consider too close a friend, or whose opinion you value too much. I hope you&#39;ll be able to at least work out a &quot;each to their own&quot; agreement. Good luck. </p>

            <p>First, it&#39;s none of her business if you joined PPC, so she should stop mocking about that. Some people choose worse things than sporking badfics.<br>Second, as many have said, we &quot;insult&quot; the fics, not the writers. There&#39;s a long way from one to another, and if someone can&#39;t tell the difference they should give up. I&#39;m sure Stephanie Meyer doesn&#39;t mind when many of us say we don&#39;t like Twilight.<br>Third, if a four or five year old writes something, I bet his/her parents saying &quot;hey, this is the fic my four/five year old child wrote, hope you like it&quot;. But in fact I see them more likely to tell their children &quot;Nice story, but we&#39;re not putting it on the web&quot;<br>Fourth, that &quot;could someone please think of the kids?&quot; thing makes me remember of The Simpsons&#39; Mrs Lovejoy, when she shouts it even though it had nothing to do with the matter they were talking about. <br>Fifth, nobody who tries his/her best would write an almighty-out-of-canon character, that&#39;s common sense. So if there&#39;s a Sue, there&#39;s little effort.  </p>

            <p>If a writer wants to get in contact with us, they can. If they want us to explain what they did wrong, we will (and missions are, in effect, fictionalised explanations to that effect). That way they can learn to make things they can be genuinely proud of, and that they will get honestly rewarding reviews on.<br>The internet is not prone to babying people. A four-year-old should not know how to make a Sue have cringeworthy sex with Legolas or similar; such an argument is patently absurd.

In which case we come off looking pretty kind by comparison...<br><br>We&#39;re the reasonable critics on the internet. We can be rational and speak civilly. There are much, much harsher groups out there.<br><br>Side note: is she your friend, not just your classmate? That should govern whether you mock her until she stops using specious &#39;think of the children&#39; arguments when her own profile has faved fics no child should ever read, or just tell her &quot;I&#39;m not going to discuss this with you, because our opinions differ too greatly on this.&quot;</p>

            <p>Essentially, it&#39;s the same thing as laughing at the blooper reels on movies. What gives us the right to laugh at those actors? They worked so hard, and they really enjoy what they do! ... Well, it&#39;s funny when they mess up, and after all, they DID put those bloopers there for everyone to see. I think that gives us every right to laugh.<br><br>In a similar vein, there&#39;s the famous stage analogy. When you get up in front of people, we expect that you&#39;ve washed your hair, maybe used a little bit of tasteful makeup, and are dressed appropriately for the performance. What badfic writers do by posting unedited, stream-of-consciousness, I-wrote-this-at-one-am-lol, or this-is-based-on-a-dream-lol, <i>drivel</i>, is get up on stage naked, having not bathed for a week, wearing rancid mayonnaise and fish heads and scream &quot;LOOK AT ME! TELL ME WHAT YOU THINK OF ME! PLZ REED N REVUU!&quot; ... Why is it wrong to say the performance stinks?<br><br>Like others have said, the fics we PPC don&#39;t show any evidence of really trying their best or thinking it through. We look for the stories that haven&#39;t been spell-checked, or that include completely false information about canon or real life (bad science is a particular annoyance for me)--especially when those errors are funny. If they really cared and tried their best, we wouldn&#39;t go after them, because they wouldn&#39;t be so chock-full of funny errors.<br><br>I think the main argument is that putting your work up in a public place, like ff.net, is an implicit consent to all forms of review--it says so in the Terms of Service, as I recall. Not all those reviews are going to be pleasant. If you can&#39;t handle that, no matter what your age, then you shouldn&#39;t post. As it is your privilege to post, it is our right to respond to it how we will.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I also point out that the PPC doesn&#39;t usually approach fic in which the author actually tries. In fact, excuses like &#39;I WROTE THIS WHILE HIGH&#39; or &quot;LOL SUGAR RUSH&#39; are our tip offs TO MAKE FUN OF THEM. Usually the errors we catch are really, really bad spelling and grammar errors that even a kid in grade school knows is wrong and posts anyway, and things that happen in writing when the person *doesn&#39;t* care. The fics we spork are born of somebody not caring one saturday night and writing about Usagi Naruto LeLonde the Third smooching up Serverus Snape and somehow growing sparkly pink wings and becoming Jesus. That is not something somebody writes when they intend to write a story for others. They do it for their own entertainment, and then post it... perhaps they think it&#39;s good? When I got a constructive crit I felt bad for a second, but then I learned from it.<br><br>If a single PPC mission goes out of its way to be mean to the writer or to be really and honestly cruel, then somebody here will catch it. It&#39;s uncool among us to be evil, I feel. The gagging and the gasping for air in the sporking is meant as a satire, as a comedy. Killing the Mary Sue is often comical (Nobody cries when an anvil falls on Wile E Coyote) or after a well-established string of offenses so it makes SENSE to do so. Any Suethor, if they read a sporking fully, would see this.<br><br>Flamers are harsher than us and crush more small children every day. But the kids won&#39;t stop writing-- some just want attention? I did when I was little. The &#39;lol i luved it&#39; comments may make them feel better, but they&#39;ll never score the &#39;You are an amazingly good writer, I especially liked the part when...&#39; comments with what they have got.<br><br>I WISH somebody PPCed my oldfic. </p>

I don&#39;t know if that &#39;came&#39; with the list or not. If it did, I&#39;m sorry for bringing it up but if it didn&#39;t come with the list and she wrote it herself... It made me think.<br><br>I never meant to be a horrible shark and offend your friend. But there is a virtue in bluntness- that&#39;s the problem with this whole argument. The PPC is blunt. Very blunt. We literally kill awful fanfiction characters We showcase how blunt we are in how much we are tired of terrible writing. We try not to be mean spirited in how blunt we are. Nobody cries when Wile E Coyote gets squashed. And nobody cries when Mary Sue dies.<br><br>We are not vicious or more impolite than the general public in anything we do. And I never meant to be, either.<br><br>But if your friend is upset about this, really and truly upset when you ask your friends for an opinion and you get a blunt truthful answer... therein lies the problem. The PPC is blunt and honest. This question thread, and the answers, were blunt and honest. If she cannot deal with blunt honesty... That makes me a little sad inside, really. Nobody here is upset and nobody here meant to make her upset. This is not a sniggering clubhouse where we cut jibs about the intelligence of people who don&#39;t agree with us. Because they aren&#39;t less intelligent than anybody else. And we aren&#39;t that petty. So why is she upset?<br><br>All anybody has on the internet is the literal to make a point. There isn&#39;t any way a poster can dance around things in order to not hurt somebody&#39;s feelings that are sensitive-- because then the poster is not saying what they mean. They are saying what they can, because they are censored by the feelings of others.<br><br>All anybody can do is add &#39;no offense&#39;, be considerate with wording and have high expectations for the subject to be a good sport if they find out about the discussion. And if the subject won&#39;t be a good sport? I guess egos are easily bruised. Maybe I was wrong in posting anything at all. And if I was, I&#39;m sorry. Really sorry, and fearful that I made everybody look like a big buttstink. But I can&#39;t say what I mean if I don&#39;t say it... and I refuse to be censored when I explicitly try to be careful.<br><br>Maybe I&#39;m bad at it. Or I don&#39;t try hard enough. Maybe I myself am somebody who sucks, smells bad, and is a mean nasty person who makes fun of others on the internet. Who knows what I am in the minds of other people. All I can do is say what I mean and pray others get my point.<br><br>It really, really saddens me to be misunderstood when I make an effort not to be, expecting others to understand I am trying to be both honest and diplomatic. I suppose it can&#39;t be done.<br><br>But I don&#39;t believe in lies.<br><br>I guess I&#39;m screwed.</p>

            <p>We are blunt and we don&#39;t apologise for it. I don&#39;t know about the rest of you, but I <i>like</i> that we&#39;re blunt. The blunt, straightforward approach of PPC agents is exactly what attracted me to this community in the first place. And &quot;blunt&quot; isn&#39;t &quot;rude&quot; - though people often are rude if they are being blunt, the two are not equivalents. Nor should they be confused with each other. <br><br>Aster, I don&#39;t think you&#39;re being too harsh (not in this post, at least - the first was less clear), though of course it&#39;s always possible that other people will see you that way and disagree. You are absolutely right that all we can do is word ourselves well and tack &quot;no offense&quot; onto the end just to make it doubly clear. Of course, we&#39;re not Xanthia and we don&#39;t have the personal friendship to consider, and that&#39;ll make it harder, but generally speaking, I don&#39;t think you have much to worry about. </p>

            <p>The threat at the bottom is disgusting.<br>I am so bloody tired of seeing that sort of thing. Smug declarations that anyone else will suffer terrible fates after they die.<br>Am I taking it personally? You bet, because it <i>is</i> personal. It&#39;s the internet equivalent of painting your car with racial slurs and being surprised when people hate you for it.<br><br>It&#39;s easy for some to shrug it off, but then, they&#39;re not the ones who are routinely being told that not being Christian makes them Bad People who are going to burn in hell.<br><br>And Xanthia? If you passed that along, I&#39;m sorry, but you&#39;re an accomplice to her being a jerk in that manner. That doesn&#39;t make you a bad person, but it does make you a person who should maybe stop to think for a moment that some of us find this sort of thing outright offensive. I&#39;m sure you&#39;re still a lovely person and that you wouldn&#39;t have meant any malice by it, but intent isn&#39;t magic, and all too often there <i>is</i> malice involved.<br><br>But it&#39;s okay. The first step is understanding. After that, it&#39;s all up to you. Your friend keeping that &#39;do not deny Jesus or else&#39; tripe in her profile? That&#39;s on her, it was her choice. It can be your choice not to help those things be passed on in future.<br><br>Regardless, I wish you well and hope you can resolve matters.</p>

            <p>&gt; To avoid double-posting, I need to ask a question: Can I PPC badfics that give Gary-Stu/Mary-Sue warnings? Because if I want to tackle a horrible, horrible Stu that seduces Cornelia from Code Geass.<br><br>It may depend on the nature of the warning, but offhand I&#39;d say no. If they know it&#39;s a Stu and they don&#39;t care, and that&#39;s the only thing wrong with it, I think it falls under &quot;your kink is not my kink.&quot; People are allowed to like Sues/Stus, even if we disagree.<br><br>However, if the writing is still terrible, then the writing is still terrible, Stu or no Stu.<br><br>Also, it may be a case like one I had, where the author has since grown up and moved on, and they aren&#39;t attached to the story anymore. In that case, it&#39;s probably okay to PPC it, but it might be polite to ask their permission.<br><br>So, really it just comes down to using your best judgement. {= )<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>As Indemaat said, mocking story =/= mocking author, but some authors can&#39;t tell the difference. It seems to me that your friend is trying &quot;attack is the best form of defence&quot; and is worried about her own stories being PPCed now that someone she knows is in a position to draw them to our attention. She might not consciously think of it in those terms, but it <i>is</i> the sort of reaction one might expect from a paticularly protective ficwriter who&#39;s found out about us.<br><br>My response would be along the lines of, &quot;If they are trying their best, why are they making such a mockery of the worlds they claim to love? If you care about [insert fandom here], you don&#39;t write things that warp it so badly. And if they can&#39;t handle criticism, they shouldn&#39;t be putting their writing up <i>where people can criticise it</i>.&quot; Possibly along with some reassurance that we don&#39;t really go after mediocre fics, only actually bad ones.<br><br>*hugs for a Xanthia* It&#39;s not an easy situation, but stick by your principles. We&#39;re not here to coddle writers, but we don&#39;t bully them either. Good luck!</p>

            <p>PPC is not about insulting the author, if anything, it is about insulting the story the author wrote. If the author can&#39;t separate their own ego from their story, that for the most part is their problem.<br><br>And though I am not a fan of this particular defense: What gives you the right to insult writers? The part of your country&#39;s constitution/laws that insure you freedom of speech. The same articles that give badfic authors the right to insult/rape the canon source material.<br><br>That bit about parents helping their five-year-olds post fic on the interwebs. Seriously? I&#39;m sure there are parents how think the internet is just like their refrigerator at home when it comes to showcasing their kids projects, but then the parents would post the story on an account of their own, to show how proud their are and receive compliments.<br><br>On the other hand, you could decide to put a little effort into trying to find out more about the author. For instance, I decided that I should only PPC stories written by people 16 and older. They are old enough to know better than to write badfic. And can&#39;t use the &quot;but I&#39;m just a little kid&quot; argument.</p>

            <p>One, four or five year olds should not be writing fanfiction, even if their parents consent. There&#39;s an age limit on ff.net for a reason.<br>Two, even if someone is at the younger end of the spectrum, that doesn&#39;t really change anything. I joined ff.net at thirteen, wrote some crap, found Pottersues and the PPC and was not ultimately scarred for life.

            <p>Many people learn about the PPC through tvtropes. It&#39;s not sad. <br><br>Discworld is really really REALLY hilarious... kind of the opposite of LotR because LotR is kind of high and pure and otherworldly and Discworld is something everyone can relate to. But both are terrrific. :D</p>

            <p>to check out the PPC Wiki page on Permission requirements. Summarised, they are &quot;hang around for a month or so, posting so we get to know you better, and then ask for Permission&quot; but there are other details in there too. Other than that, I recommend checking out the Original Series (also on the wiki) and generally familiarising yourself with the place.</p>

            <p>I honestly don&#39;t understand how people come up with stuff like this. Can&#39;t they just write their own names in instead of canon names?

            <p>The hair trigger raving nerd and the slightly impassive trickster large beast?

            <p>Each badfic chapter was approximately one page long, including author&#39;s notes. This assassination fic is longer than the badfic-- simply because I described what things looked like and where they were. I had a hard time cutting out samples for this fic because there was a problem with every single line... and not because it was content heavy. Because each chapter was approximately forty lines long at the most. I had to restrain myself-- MOST of the badfic is actually in the sporking. Any more, and I might as well just have MSTed the whole thing rather than being a mission pointing out the really most terrible bits.<br><br>The &#39;prison&#39; is given no description. It is unknown what sort of place it is, or even if others than Link and Azelynn are there. Ganon&#39;s Tower is marginally more described, but only because the Mary Sue is making it out to be as scary as possible for her.<br><br>The single longest description was included in the sporking-- the Mary Sue&#39;s description. I was amazed. Even Link didn&#39;t get any description to him beyond his soul-wrenching angst in regards to his twu wub Azelynn. This is shocking to me because usually Suethors write their lust objects to accentuate their sex appeal, or at the very least how they are the most perfect man on earth.</p>

            <p>Well, I&#39;m glad that silly Voldemort is out of the way, what was the point of him anyway? On to the crappy romantic drama! Yay!<br>I... sort of understand the logic of removing the canon conflict: to clear the stage for the fanfic conflict and make it easier to focus on that. However, I&#39;m not sure why these authors do things like making it an AU where that conflict doesn&#39;t exist. If Voldemort had never existed, the Harry Potter universe would be completely different, and (based admittedly on approximately a paragraph of actual story) the author seems blissfully unaware of that fact.<br>*sigh*</p>

            <p>*Cautiously sticks head out from behind conveniently placed desk and decides it&#39;s safe*  <br>Ummm.... hello. I&#39;m Alice. I&#39;ve been lurking around here for a while after reading the original adventures of the PPC and decided to join in on the action. Permission to come aboard?<br><br> Me and my partner, if he shows up, have had a traumatic experience with a rather famous mary sue, she-who-must-not-be-named of the limpid blue tear eyes and legendary badfic! status. Yeah, that one. *shudder*. Since then, to avoid damaging what surviving brain cells we have left, would like to help out. We are good with weapons (nun-chucks, sporks, swords, bows, ect.) and have a good knowledge of  most common canons, especially if it speaks with a British accent. Also, if you run into any mary sues wandering around the Assassin&#39;s creed universe, do tell. My partner has had his eye on a hidden blade for quite a while. Will also take on anyone messing with Eomer. I&#39;ve been freaking out about how the whole sister-son references back to Angelo-Saxon culture *starts getting side-tracked, snaps out of it*. Anyways, just saying hi. Now to find Sunflower Official before this post gets too long....</p>

            <p>Hello all. It&#39;s been a little over a month since I first started posting on the Board and talking on the IRC.  I’ve decided to make my first attempt at gaining permission. Your thoughts on my story would also be appreciated as well, as I intend to continue writing it as well. <br><br>Writing Sample:<br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6589907/1/Deltora_Quest_A_Dungeons_and_Dragons_Adventure"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6589907/1/Deltora_Quest_A_Dungeons_and_Dragons_Adventure">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6589907/1/Deltora_Quest_A_Dungeons_and_Dragons_Adventure</a></a><br><br>Character summary<br><br>Agent Name:Maria<br>Real Name: Maria <br><br>Home continuum: Metal Gear Solid<br><br>Age: 20ish<br><br>Agent Career: 6 years<br><br>Notable points: During 2008 Mary sue invasion she was bitten by a Vampire!Sue, has since refused to use any of the powers gained from such a change. Being of the Discworld variety, she has sublimated her addiction to physical contact, and it is not uncommon for her to greet with enthusiastic hugs, and to give many playful punches. This has led to some to think she is, in fact, Luxury in disguise.<br><br>On an unspecified mission into the Redwall continuum, she succumbed to bloodwrath during a slash moment, and attempted to kill Matthias and Cluny. She would later admit to having read The Cluny Fic shortly before hand, on a dare. She has since been barred from any missions there, and refuses to have bloodwrath treated.<br><br>General information:<br>A Cat/human hybrid recruited from a badfic, she has served in the PPC for 6 years. She has had several previous partners; most don’t usually stay with her for long, mostly due to her infrequent violent outbursts. Despite this, she is a cheerful person, and has a fondness for collecting many things (read; not on fire or nailed down) and has filled her RC with much plunder.  She wears a cat suit to deal with her vulnerability to sunlight; the irony is not lost on her.  She can pronounce an “!” if surprised.<br><br>Agent Name: Sienna <br><br>Real Name: Mark Sienna<br><br>Home continuum: Cthulhuverse<br><br>Age: 19<br><br>He was created on and RP thread, one in which an in-game argument led to several members godmoding to kill the others, and he fell through a resulting plothole. The only visible part of him is above the nose, the rest is always covered.  He wears a red scarf which is always swaying, not even he knows why. He has advanced regenerative powers, though it is hindered by certain types of magic, as well as magical weapons. <br><br>He is also able to heal others, though doing so leaves him with an exact duplicate of the wound, which heals extremely slow and will leave a permanent reminder, usually a scar. This has led to him wearing clothes that cover most of him. He is a nice enough person, despite his ominous and broody look. He enjoys videos games and has an over abundance of sarcasm. He likes to use the two adamantium knives he has no actual explanation for having.<br><br>Agent name: Cadmar<br><br>Real Name: Cadmar<br><br>Home continuum: World one<br><br>Age 19<br><br>He fell into HQ through a plot hole right into Luxuries RC, where after a few awkward explanations, many seduction attempts, and an impromptu make-out session, he was led to the Marquis de Sod’s office for recruitment.  He dislikes the entirety of the management, believing that control corrupts, and corrupted flowers are a scary idea. He is an avid gamer, and listens to music as much as he can. He has a good sense of humor, though it can be dark and sadistic at times, and is usually in a pleasant mood. <br><br>Out right hates being interrupted, and takes major offence to it. He has read many badfic, several of which were Legendary, leaving him with a spotty memory, and he relishes the chance to help the canon. He wears mostly black, camo-pants with many pockets, and always has a backpack with him which he uses to carry a variety of things. He uses two machetes as his main weapons, and prefers most WWII and Vietnam era weapons, which he has expressed a desire to collect. He is slightly overweight, due to a caffeine addiction.<br><br>They are all to be placed in the Department of Floaters.<br><br>The fic I intend to first take down is &#39;A Small Crime&#39; (ironicly hilarious) a Suefic in the Shrek fandom.  Plus, the author has a quote about Tieflings in the beginning of a chapter, for that, the punishment will be worse.<br><br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5097340/1/"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5097340/1/">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5097340/1/</a></a><br></p>

            <p>I know nothing about Deltora Quest, but I take it the story is meant to be something along the lines of Darths &amp; Droids? Sounds like fun. Your writing is entertaining, though you could use a refresher on how to punctuate around dialogue. I&#39;d be glad to explain things, if you like, or you can look it up. There are all kinds of helpful guides around the internet.<br><br>I&#39;ll be interested in reading a three-agent team.

            <p>Thankyouthankyouthankyou! You would be correct, the general premise will be like Darths and Droids, though I might add in some RL scenes. I&#39;m going to be using one of the themes from Dm of the Rings as well, that is, the story setting is a ripe place for adventures, but the story itself would be a very silly game.<br><br>Yeah, the main thing I&#39;ve been told was the dialogue punctuation, everything else was edited by  my friend. I&#39;ll have to search around for some guides on it, it is simple enough to fix. <br><br>I actually went looking for your page on the wiki, interested in the agent you mentioned, and like the hoser I am, the idea of looking on the Permission Giver Page never occurred to me. Would it be okay if I emailed my PPC work to you for editing? I’ll of course do most myself, but someone with more experience could give more insight. Thanks again!<br></p>

            <p>I have been a longtime reader and fan of the PPC, and for some time now have been wanting to throw a couple of agents into the fray. My most policed fandom would be G.I. Joe, which I have noticed that almost no one else is doing. <br>My agents would, however, gladly take on other cases that they were qualified for. Since I am a huge geek, I know most of the common fandoms PPCd well. May the Force be with you. Live long and prosper. Hey doll merry doll merry doll dillo. Bright blue his jacket is, and hiis boots are yellow. You get the idea.<br>My agents would handle bad slash, sues, and complete possesion by the spirit of the author(ess). <br>If anyone wants to take a look at some of my own fic to get an idea of my writing style, skill level, and skills of grammar-fu, I am CrystalOfEllinon at ff.net. published in the cartoon section under G.I. Joe. Thanks!</p>

            <p>When I get myself into that kind of fix, the first thing I do is re-read what I&#39;ve written up to that point (or at least the last few chapters). Often this is enough to get my brain working again.<br>The second thing to do is think about where you want to end up. What&#39;s keeping you from getting there? How can you fix it? <br>If none of this works, I&#39;ll often switch to writing something different but similar for awhile and just let the problem roll around in the back of my mind for a week or so.

            <p>depends on what makes you feel more comfortable. I usually leave the story for a while (a month, more or less) then re-read it and try to find the problem in order to fix it. In my experience, corners appear when you haven&#39;t led your characters the way they wanted to go, so you just have to walk back and take a new path. More or less what everyone else said.</p>

            <p>The thing about corners is that usually there&#39;s a reason or another why you can&#39;t get out, and you were forced into the corner because of loose ends being tied up.<br><br>I usually cut off the corner and start again where I began to get railroaded into the corner and try and take it in another direction.<br><br>Kind of like knitting. Make a mistake? foot of your sock too short? Rip the sock out and go back to the problem. Redo it the right way.<br><br>This is what drafts are for! :D</p>

            <p>I usually start with a good idea, and end up at 1/3 (or 2/3 if I am lucky) stuck usually with &quot;and now what I do?&quot;. However, I leave the story alone for a bit, and resume hen I get a good idea. It&#39;s time-consuming (a Knight Rider-Card Captor Sakura crossover was very close to be considered dead fic since it once took six months to write a chapter, but I also had a dead computer in the meanwhile. If you are wondering, i&#39;s in Italian, so I don&#39;t think linking it would be useful at all), but it works.</p>

            <p>For me, writer&#39;s block is a sign that I did something wrong somewhere. It can be anything, really--someone said something they wouldn&#39;t have, or didn&#39;t do something they should have, or maybe I just didn&#39;t understand their motivations properly, or whatever. I go over the piece until I figure out what it is, fix it, re-write whatever needs it, and go from there.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>As you could probably tell by the subject, I&#39;m a newbie to this board. Long-time reader of the lovely pseudo-series, though. I write (gasp!) non fan-fic stuff that never sees the light of day, because I hate it too much. I&#39;m psychotic in the sense of actively suffering from psychoses, bisexual, a furry (scaly, more accurately), have a habit of reading badfic (&#39;specially bad slashy lemons) for amusement, in love with blood, a mildly musical moron, and an annoyingly alliterative asshole at times. Also, bloody narcissistic. I use an odd mixture of british and american spellings, having grown up reading a mixture of literature from both cultures.<br>And in case you were wondering, yes, I have yiffed in hell. It was hot.</p>

            <p>&quot;Merry Christmas! Where are my presents?&quot; while entering the door. After that she starts looking for them, putting some tables upside down meanwhile. When she finds nothing, she mourns aloud and directs to the goose Aster brought. &quot;Remember when I said I&#39;d eat you the last? I lied&quot; she tells the goose, trying to sound funny. But as nobody notices even she spoke, she gets depressed and eats the goose alone in a corner.</p>

            <p>My co-author and I Apollo Night have been writing a series called The Death of Mary Sue. The characters in this story work for a fictional sue slaying organisation called the SSU - Sue Slayers United. It was pointed out to me that there are many similarities between the SSU and PPC and it was decided by you guys that we didn&#39;t have to change anything as long as I had a disclaimer, which is fair enough. But now we are going back and editing much of the original work and making improvements. To me, it&#39;s a matter of professional pride and I hate the idea that my story is very similar to someone else&#39;s and I would like to be as original as possible. I thought I would post up the link and see if there is anything you guys would like me to change. Heck, if someone wrote something that was very similar to my work I&#39;d be a little annoyed, constructive criticism is welcome.<br><br>I have received messages from people who wanted to start writing their own sue slaying stories after reading about the SSU so I think you guys can expect to see a bit of a boom in this genre.  If anyone gives us ideas, I will give credit. I will have something at the beginning of the story to say “I do not own xxx idea as it is the property of this person.”<br><br>Here are some improvements we have already made or are in the process of making:<br><br>1.  The slayers no longer use neutralizers and we are trying to come up with something to replace them. This was actually and idea I pulled from Men in Black (not you guys) but it still bugs me as I don’t want my stuff to be too similar to yours<br>2.   You’ll be happy to know that we now have a beta reader. Given one of us has dyslexia and the other has a learning disability that leaves her unable to spell a beta reader really should have been our first priority. We now have one.<br><br>Any other suggestions are welcome.<br><br><br>This is the link to the first story, but there are four in total<br><br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4751175/1/The_Death_of_Mary_sue"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4751175/1/The_Death_of_Mary_sue">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4751175/1/The_Death_of_Mary_sue</a></a><br></p>

            <p>Your professional pride is <i>most</i> admirable :)  Thank you. I&#39;ve read through your first two chapters, and they look just fine to me; I certainly don&#39;t see anything that looks distinctly PPCish. My only critical comment is a proofreader&#39;s one, that you seem to be lacking a number of commas, usually in dialogue just before someone&#39;s name is said; that makes it a bit fast-paced while reading. <br><br>Thanks for the heads-up!</p>

            <p>We did a thing! July and I co-wrote a mission based on a Suefic based in the Doctor Who universe (or Whoverse or Whoniverse or Whoiverse or however you prefer). You can read it here: <a href="http://ho.fi/95"><a href="http://ho.fi/95">http://ho.fi/95</a></a> (Do not be alarmed, it&#39;s just an url shortener.)<br><br>Comments and concrit welcome! And if you&#39;re wondering, I plan for Artell to become an agent on his own right, for which I will get Permission on my own once the time is right.</p>

            <p>I already put out this request via IRC, but I figured I might try here too.<br><br>I&#39;m looking for good slashfic for a friend of mine who seems to be going down the &quot;16-year old badslash writer&quot; road, to serve as (hopefully) a good influence. I&#39;ve already started helping by beta-reading for her, but I figured that having something good to read could help, too.<br><br>(I&#39;d direct her to the DBS, but honestly she can live without knowing dinosaur smutfics exist.)</p>

            <p>I recommend this author: <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/u/1135093/ReaperRain">ReaperRain</a>. In particular, her &#39;TESIV: Oblivion&#39; stories<br><br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5096565/1/Gold_Black_Red">Gold, Black, Red</a> (rated M),<br><br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5346323/1/Unfortunately_Enthralled">Unfortunately Enthralled</a> (rated T), and<br><br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5713464/1/Anathema">Anathema</a> (rated T).<br><br>This author is good. She is <i>really</i> good. She&#39;s the kind of slash writer who can (and, in &#39;Unfortunately Enthralled&#39;, does) take ten chapters to get to a first kiss, and yet keep you glued to the screen the whole time.<br><br>Characterisation, tension, drama, comedy, it&#39;s all there. She also has the gift of not focusing solely on the main romantic couple, making the romance part of a bigger picture. You know, interesting.<br><br>Hope it helps your friend develop her skills.</p>
