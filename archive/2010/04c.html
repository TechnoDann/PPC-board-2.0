            <p>Awhile back I was paging through the <i>Animorphs</i> section on ff.net, and I came across one incredibly interesting story:<br><br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3464631/1/Sacred_Host">Sacred Host</a> by Qoheleth<br>Somewhere in the Yeerk pool, you know someone is doing this.<br><font size="2">Animorphs - Rated: K+ - English - Drama/Spiritual - Chapters: 18 - Words: 27,830 - Reviews: 172 - Updated: 4-21-10 - Published: 3-29-07</font><br><br>If you can&#39;t stand religion at least academically, this story is probably not for you, but it&#39;s just so thoughtful and the author uses such a deliciously ironic narrative voice that I couldn&#39;t help but get sucked in. It is sadly unfinished, but in progress, and I felt I had to share it.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>You&#39;re allowed to like whatever you like - as someone wise once said, there&#39;s no accounting for taste. Also, you&#39;re hardly &quot;supporting&quot; anything; if it were a bought book, yes, but this is the Internet - the only way you could &#39;support&#39; the fic would be to widely advertise it on different forums and communities as a great fic. So don&#39;t worry there. <br><br>As for whether or not it&#39;s plagiarism in the first place... maybe. Probably, if it&#39;s not actually a Star Wars fic. To me it mostly reeks of lack of imagination, but as you&#39;re comparing a canonical work to a fanfic work, it&#39;s not much of an issue. <br><br>If you think they would take it well, I&#39;d say there&#39;s no harm in tactfully telling them you find the homages too overt. Use your best judgement. <br><br>:)</p>

            <p>If you like it, you like it. There&#39;s nothing that anyone can really do about that. And if it&#39;s a fanfiction, then it can&#39;t really be called on charges of plagiarism, if that was even something to worry about in the first place. Take Eragon for example: people dislike it for the purple prose. Most of the plot can be correlated to events in the star wars series, but I can honestly say that if the story wasn&#39;t so focused on Eragon and the writing was so floral, it might actually be a decent fantasy yarn, like a David Eddings book kind of thing.</p>

            <p>about &quot;Fanfic can&#39;t be plagiarism&quot;.<br><br>Fanfic is, almost by definition, copyright infringement (unless the owner gives express permission or the work is in the public domain - author&#39;s death + either 50 or 70 years depending on where you are), but that&#39;s a separate issue to plagiarism.<br><br>Summarising in my own words, here&#39;s the difference (based on conversations I&#39;ve had over the years with my sister, who&#39;s a copyright lawyer - although I may have got confuzzed on some of the details):<br><br>Copyright infringement is, basically, someone taking someone else&#39;s intellectual property and using it without permission - e.g. say, if Warner Brothers used Mickey Mouse in one of their cartoons without permission, that would be copyright infringement.<br><br>Plagiarism is someone passing-off another&#39;s work as their own. Fanfic can definitely be plagiarism - the whole fandom wank surrounding the Cassandra Claire <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Cassandra_Claire">Draco Trilogy</a> is a case in point.<br><br>Whether Eragon is plagiarised is a separate issue. It definitely is <i>heavily</i> inspired by Star Wars in matters of plot, but for it to be plagiarism, I think it would need to be lifting lines of dialogue with little modification.<br><br>As for the fic Chliever mentioned; not sure if it would count as plagiarism <i>per se</i>, but does sound as if the author is a little bit shameless in their borrowings/<i>hommages</i>.<br><br>Elcalion, descending from soapbox<br></p>

            <p>He admits them, that he&#39;s inspired by those things. He says it&#39;s a tribute to things he likes, intending to portray them positively.

            <p>Even if doesn&#39;t cross the line to plagiarism, a too-blatant shout-out might only serve to annoy some (like me) who like their references subtle.

            <p>If/when I ask for permission, I&#39;m thinking that I&#39;d like one of my agents to be a self-insert, but there&#39;s a problem with that that I&#39;m not sure how to deal with. I currently have a rather disabling lung condition that severely limits my mobility and has reduced my stamina, so I&#39;m having trouble thinking of how my agent-character would deal with said condition on missions (or really, even <i>go</i> on missions). I&#39;d rather not write the self-insert as joining before I got sick, since that eliminates some of the personal growth and development I&#39;ve gone through since I&#39;ve been sick, but I&#39;m not sure what else I could do. The only other thing I could think of was to have DoSAT come up with something that mitigated the condition to the point of being able to go on missions, with the explicit understanding that it would only be used for missions. I&#39;m open to any and all ideas anyone else may have.</p>

            <p>If there&#39;s a cure somewhere out in the multiverse, you could plausibly have PPC Medical &quot;borrow&quot; it in some form. An inhaler of atomised bacta or kolto from Star Wars might do the trick, and may prove less than permanent, allowing it to be used as a &quot;reliever&quot; temporary plot device (I&#39;m thinking Asterix&#39;s magic potion here!). <br><br>As for self-inserts, in my case Logan is a more psychotic, athletic, more random version of me, with my low-level addictions to various soft drinks blown up into a compulsive dependence and with an even more flippant and annoying sense of humour, but with a few random quirks thrown in for good measure.<br><br>I still haven&#39;t written Logan enough for much character development to occur, but I&#39;m aiming for his character to diverge in interesting directions, even if he does start out as more-or-less a self insert. </p>

            <p>If you&#39;re at all familiar with the <i>Dragonlance</i> books, Raistlin&#39;s cough potion might be applicable.

            <p>That&#39;s like saying, &quot;Hungry? Here, have a fork!&quot; But I know what you mean; <i>Star Trek</i> has an easy cure for lung cancer by 2150, and the continumn stretches all the way to the 31st century, so you could easily say your agent was cured by <i>Trek</i> technology that Medical snitched to patch up canon characters. <br><br>Anyway, Neshomeh&#39;s right - take whatever best suits, especially if you can make it into a plot device or just somehow amusing.</p>

            <p>Make it yourself, but cured.  Most of our agents that are named after us are at the very least more violent than reality.  I know that mine is more violent, thinner, messier, more coordinated, has a more interesting story of origin, and cooler gadgets.  Not so much me as I want to be (except the thinner bit), but more my base exaggerated in the areas that make a more fun read as a PPC agent, if that makes sense.</p>

            <p>Though I&#39;d say it&#39;s a good idea to add flaws you don&#39;t have as well as abilities you don&#39;t have. Agent Laburnum is, on the good side, more physically fit, slightly more sociable, and has opportunities to do much cooler stuff than me, and on the bad side, more self-hating, affected with far more psychological problems (in her case, beserker rages, depressive tendencies, some gender identity issues, and a refusal to acknowledge that any of the above might be a problem), and more careless (I do let my mouth run away with me in real life, though I don&#39;t do it as much as I used to, but I&#39;m not stupid enough to try and face hundred-to-one odds alone).</p>

            <p>If you feel that your condition is a key part of your character, then you don&#39;t need to cure it altogether--perhaps the cure is something worked into the disguise generator, or it only lessens the symptoms.

            <p>I&#39;m thinking about Agents that I could use, but I&#39;m not sure if some of these ideas would work. So:<br>1. Can one of my Agents have been recruited by another, already existing Agent that is no longer active in the PPC, and hasn&#39;t been for a while? (i.e, not one of mine.)<br><br>2. If an Agent is a giant cat, for want of a better term, is it okay if she doesn&#39;t wear a proper uniform? Cats don&#39;t wear clothes, see. I was thinking a black armband with a Flashpatch could substitute.<br><br>3. How long does it take for an agent to become trained and ready for missions after they have been recruited?</p>

            <p>1/ That depends on the agent. If the person who wrote that agent is still around, it&#39;s polite to ask them first. It&#39;s also worth making sure there&#39;s nothing that would clash with the agent&#39;s existing backstory (for instance, if you claimed your agent was recruited by Acacia &#39;in her third year as an assassin&#39;, you&#39;d run up against the fact that Acy was only an assassin for about a year and a half).<br><br>2/ Agent Mmrrowl would like to say hello. :P On a more relevant note, a lot of agents don&#39;t wear uniform anyway. The <a href="http://www.misssandman.com/Images/ppc.jpg">classic drawing</a> of Jay and Acacia shows them in jeans. Since the uniform gets disguised like everything else on missions, and since no one not in the PPC should <i>be</i> in HQ, the only real requirement seems to be the flashpatch.<br><br>3/ Ahahahaha.<br><br>3 actual answer/ It varies. Some agents have described fairly comprehensive training, some are just handed several canon books (and a copy of the <a href="http://ppc_manual.webs.com/">Manual</a>) and sent off to a Response Centre. Go with whatever makes the most narrative sense; the PPC has never claimed consistancy in its proceedures.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Your agent is from the Cats continuum, right? Is (s)he somewhat humanlike? If so, I still have the patterns for a uniform designed with animal comfort right over...here...no...there...somewhere, anyway. Randall loves it (more than his last uniform). I&#39;m sure that the PPC seamstresses would be modify it to fit your agent, if you want. It&#39;s nice and loose, and easy to slip out of if it gets to be too restraining.</p>

            <p>I don&#39;t really think batman should ever be shown as actually caring about another human being because he only seems to even acknowledge someone&#39;s existence if they can be used as a tool to further his goals or as an enemy. True, sometimes his goals are to save people FROM villians, but that&#39;s just part of his moral obligation, it&#39;s like saving a herd of sheep for him. example:<br><br>Barbara Gordon:&quot; I volunteered.&quot;<br>Dick Grayson: &quot;You think you did. You don&#39;t know him like I do. He manipulates, pulls strings... anything to get what he wants. &quot;<br><br>Correct me if I&#39;m wrong, but Batman doesn&#39;t, wouldn&#39;t, care about what happens to his enemies after he catches them. It&#39;s OOC to assume otherwise, I think<br><br>Also, Scarecrow is awesome. Why is there not more stories about Scarecrow?</p>

            <p>He goes through a lot of those.  There are other times when Dick and Bruce are actually quite sweet together.  And going into other Robins, Tim especially is devoted to Bruce.  I mean, he alienated all his friends and went on an odyssey around the world because he thought there might be a chance Bruce was still alive.  <br><br>Have you read <i>Identity Crisis</i>?  A strong argument for Bruce&#39;s actually caring about the &quot;Batfamily&quot; could be formed solely from the way Bruce comforts Tim at the end of that story.</p>

            <p>I&#39;d have to disagree (about the Batman caring, not the Scarecrow being awesome), although I think it varies from writer to writer. <br><br>If Batman does not care what happens to those he captures, then why would he bother capturing them in the first place? Why wouldn&#39;t he just become the DC&#39;s version of the Punisher and off all of his foes? After all, his ultimate end goal is to ensure that what happened to him (his parents&#39; deaths) does not happen to anyone else. It would be so much easier to do that if all the criminals are dead. Why bother being bound by a moral code if it stands in the way of your ultimate goal? He has the moral code because he cares, because he must care. Otherwise he&#39;s no better than the criminals he fights.<br><br>Besides, there are quite a few stories where Batman is shown to be sympathetic towards his rogues (again, varying from writer to writer and medium to medium). The BTAS episode &#39;Heart of Ice,&#39; for example, has Batman react with horror to the apparent fate of Dr. Freeze&#39;s wife and later express his sympathy to the villain in person. One could argue that Batman exaggerated those emotions to try and manipulate Freeze, but I would disagree.</p>

            <p>First off, a minor note. This story appears to actually be from the DCAU!Batman continuum (the cartoon from the &#39;90s) as indicated by a few off-hand references. It seems to be a tie-in to the events of the episode &quot;Harley&#39;s Holiday,&quot; where Harley gives Batman a thank-you kiss at the very end.<br><br>After reading this, I&#39;d say that while parts of it were enjoyable (I&#39;m an incorrigible Harley Quinn fan) there were several issues that qualified it as badfic:<br><br>-- Batman is incredibly out of character. Letting one of his rogues into the Batcave, revealing his backstory if not his secret identity - not the actions we expect of the World&#39;s Greatest Detective. He&#39;s been turned into a lustful dope. Alfred even says as much in chapter 5: &quot;I believe both your parents and I taught you to treat a lady better than that, sir. I do not believe that your actions were very becoming.&quot;<br><br>-- Technical issues. There are a few places where the tenses switch, especially on the first page. Also, &#39;growled&#39; as an alternative word for &#39;said&#39; appears more times than it should.<br><br>-- Harley is almost if not entirely (YMMV) a Replacement!Sue. The fic version has had a rotten life, but almost everyone mentioned in the story loves and respects her. While the actual Harley was sympathetic, she was still a psychopath. This one not so much.<br><br>-- The improbable biology of the lemon.</p>

            <p>A while back I asked about unofficial sequels to valid continua, asking if they were to be considered when going on missions. The consensus seemed to be that while the original is canon to the sequel, the sequel is not canon to the original, in some sort of bizarre &#39;half-and-half&#39; continuum that I guess makes sense.<br><br>I&#39;m now asking about what I like to call &#39;official&#39; unofficial sequels. These are sequels that are written by the author or otherwise approved as being in the same canon by them, but don&#39;t really mesh well with the original work. Examples include Dragon Ball GT and Phantom of the Opera: Love Never Dies.<br><br>How should these be considered when dealing with badfic for the original, if at all?</p>

            <p>I know I at least like to know if people like my missions. I tell myself that I don&#39;t need to hear it all the time from everyone. It makes it all the more special if someone says something once in a while.<br><br>Yeah, movies tend to have that effect. On the other hand, it may also mean more (potential) agents become familiar with the fandom and thus more people to do missions.</p>

            <p>Hi!  I recently discovered the PPC series whilst I was patrolling deviantART (I think I found PPC fanart on the page of the author of the &quot;Girls Next Door&quot; webcomic.), and as a former creator of Mary Sues (I was twelve!) who understands their annoying menace, I fell in love with the series immediately.  Enough, at least, to create my own sub-division which awaits only Miss Cam&#39;s deliberations to be sent to the Google directory of sites.<br><br>So...mayIpleasejointhePPCboards?

            <p>Hi!  I&#39;m more familiar with the PPC LOTR-side of things, but I was wondering if you could check some old fanfics I wrote for an anime.  I have an OC in there.  She&#39;s related to a canon character (but otherwise has no pairing with any of them), and is generally tolerated (if not loved) by the other canonicals.<br><br>Is she a Sue?<br><br>Her name is Lorelei &quot;Rory&quot; Mustang, niece of Roy Mustang from FMA.  I&#39;ve run her through the Mary Sue checklist, but I just want to make sure she&#39;s not being written as a Sue.<br><br>Her fics:<br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3092938/1/The_Niece"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3092938/1/The_Niece">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3092938/1/The_Niece</a></a> - In which she is introduced.<br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3493713/1/Snow_White_and_The_Eight_Dwarves"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3493713/1/Snow_White_and_The_Eight_Dwarves">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3493713/1/Snow_White_and_The_Eight_Dwarves</a></a> - Story within a story, and very much a shameless parody.<br><br>Thanks!

            <p>I haven&#39;t gotten past the first chapter quite yet, but the biggest problem I&#39;m seeing thus far has nothing to do with being a Sue and more to do with you can&#39;t decide who&#39;s perspective the story is from - Rory&#39;s or Havoc&#39;s. <br><br>It keeps swapping back and forth.  We should only hear the thoughts and feelings of one of the characters in the narrative - <br><br>In the first paragraph:<br>&quot;Aw shit, I knew I should have sprang for the sleeping pills.&quot; Rory Fox Mustang ruffled her dark hair for the nth time that day as she nodded her apology to Havoc<br><br>-  it shows that Rory is our perspective.  She&#39;s the first to talk, the first to be introduced. I also take it that all of the little aggravated comments are hers too:<br>&quot;Who knew you still had to baby-sit fifteen-year-olds? Not possible!&quot;<br><br>But in the rest of the story, we&#39;re constantly treated to Havoc being the active character.  <i>Havoc</i> babysits Rory. <i>Havoc</i> is being inconvenienced. We get inside looks into how Havoc responds to comments.<br>&quot;Havoc sighed. Did both Mustangs have to insult him?&quot;<br><br><br>You need to choose one or the other to keep as the active character.  We only hear their thoughts, and only get glimpses of their personality. Trying to do both only gets confusing. <br><br>*goes back to reading*</p>

            <p>Just finished The Niece - the real test for sueness will probably be in the second story, but a few comments before I move on:<br><br>1)  The second sentence has a word mismatch.  &quot;And for the past week or <b>saw</b>, First Lieutenant Riza Hawkeye had not made a peep about it, not minding the Colonel&#39;s constant absences.&quot;<br><br>2)  The writing is a bit clumsy all around but nothing particularly bad.  You&#39;re probably aware of this as an older work.<br><br>3)  The &#39;reveal&#39; is a bit much.  Hawkeye and Mustang wouldn&#39;t spend so much time revealing the facts to the group, particularly since they just admitted to stalking him for so long. They&#39;d be indignant and probably wouldn&#39;t reveal much information past &quot;this is the Colonel&#39;s Niece.&quot;<br><br>In particular, you shouldn&#39;t mention her parents&#39; death in this story.  It adds nothing to the narrative and seems out of place in the light-hearted comical tone.  Save the backstory for later. <br><br><br>Otherwise, fun read.  I particularly liked the shameless music suggestions.  They really made the sleuthing scenes. <br><br>*goes on to read second fic*</p>

            <p>I&#39;ll probably rework The Niece 2 as it&#39;s actually an awful piece of garbage, not to mention about an embarrasssing subject, and written when I was extremely immature.  With The Niece, I will follow your editing suggestions (when my lazy self can rouse my diligent writer self into reworking things).  Rory won&#39;t really be making appearances in any more fanfiction, unless I need her as a plot device or a convenient low-level woobie.<br><br>As for SW8 (Snow White and the Eight Dwarves), I guess that I forgot early on that Rory was the writer of the story, and not me.  For Roy&#39;s more *explosive* moments, I have to explain that most of this is first-Anime verse (not Manga, and not the new &quot;Brotherhood&quot; series).  It deviates a lot from the manga canon, and so features a few episodes where Roy does &quot;freak out&quot; -- though I probably have to tone down the &quot;freak&quot; a lot.<br><br>To answer the &quot;Go&quot; question -- scenes from the original anime depict Breda and Falman (or Fuery) playing what appears to be Go. (Japanese chess with flat pieces wooden pieces?  I&#39;m not sure; most fanfic writers tend to interpret it as Go.)  I agree, though, that chess is usually more FMA-related as there&#39;s this huge manga subplot with Roy considering his men chess-pieces in a game with the Fuhrer, and his &quot;queen&quot; being taken away.<br><br>My favorite chapter for SW8 (and the only decent one) has to be &quot;A Brief Interlude&quot; (so-far).<br><br>Thanks so much for the concrit!  Bad writing is much easier to rework than a Sue.<br></p>

            <p>What you describe (Japanese chess with flat wooden pieces) sounds more like Shogi <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shogi"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shogi">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shogi</a></a> than Go <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_%28game%29"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_%28game%29">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_%28game%29</a></a> <br><br><br>I&#39;ve only actually seen the first anime - and not all of it actually. I&#39;ve seen over half the episodes, so I&#39;m no expert.  My comment about Mustang getting angry is not so much that he /never/ gets angry so much as that he doesn&#39;t fly off the handle for no reason.  In his conversation with Hughes, I could see no reason that Mustang would be getting angry at Hughes.<br><br>Hughes sent his niece to be looked after by Mustang after her parents died - I should think Mustang would actually find this somewhat rehabilitating after killing Winry&#39;s parents. It just doesn&#39;t seem like something Roy would get so worked up about. </p>

            <p>Will change that in the rework.  I guess I got infected by too many fanfics portraying Roy as more spitfire that I may have lost sight of canon.  In hindsight, he&#39;s a cool customer mostly.  *facepalms*<br><br>The primary reasons I have for Roy&#39;s hesitating to have Rory stay with him full-time are I didn&#39;t want Rory to appear too cuddly-close to Roy (preventing Sue-age), and I didn&#39;t want her too near Roy&#39;s brigade as the more pivotal events of the series approach (again, prevention of Sue-age).  And, given his bachelor lifestyle, Roy would probably find caring for Rory awkward, even if having a ward would be rehabilitating.<br><br>Still...am going to completely rework SW8 when I have time.  I cringe when I read it now.  Thanks so much!</p>

            <p>I would agree that Roy would find caring for her awkward, and he may actually perceive that she would be better off on her own.  I could see him being fairly cold to her - similar to how he treats Ed and Al in fact.  Roy &#39;adopted&#39; Ed and Al in much the same way he&#39;d probably adopt Rory: keeping an eye on her while keeping his distance. <br><br>He&#39;d probably offer the rare bit of advice, or send people to keep an eye on her.  If Rory proves to be very competent (she should have some exceptional qualities to explain why she&#39;s in the military at age 15, or else simply make her older), then Roy probably won&#39;t spend much time worrying about her.<br><br>One more quibble - have you thought about changing her name so it&#39;s not just a one letter difference from Roy&#39;s name?  It&#39;s <i>extremely</i> easy to confuse the two when quickly reading.  </p>

            <p>She&#39;s in a military academy, so I guess being fifteen is okay.

            <p>Hey all,<br><br>I&#39;m wondering if anyone else has picked up a particular type of Trojun while surfing FF.net? It is a rather nasty one which calls itself things like XP Total Secruity, or Vista Secure Protection 2010.<br><br>It bypasses your regular security programme (although a good one will deal with it), and if your PC allows it to it will change settings to disable your firewall, and start up with your PC. Also it flashes up messages telling you that loads and loads of malware has been found on your PC.<br><br>It&#39;s nastiest trick however is that it redirects your .exe files (i.e the stuff on your desktop) to its own server which then flashes up a message telling you that &quot;this programme is infected&quot; meaning you can&#39;t open stuff like Windows Media Player or any games or word processing programmes.<br><br>It also hijacks your internet and bars you from looking at any site except its own one, which then tells you to &quot;buy this programme&quot;.<br><br>I&#39;ve had three versions of this little sod now, and am getting rather sick of it. Has anyone else had a similar experience? I think that it is coming from FF.net, but I&#39;m not 100% sure. <br><br>Crystal</p>

            <p>I hate that thing. It&#39;s stuck on my computer, and I can&#39;t do a system restore without loosing an enormous amount of stuff. However, it is possible to neutralize it. I created a shortcut in my Startup folder (Start menu --&gt; Programs --&gt; right click Startup --&gt; Open) pointing to taskmanager.exe, and that pops up before the virus can stop it. Go to the Processes tab, and scroll down, searching for a description that is the same name as the program it goes with (including the .exe ending). End any that you find. And switch to Firefox—I think that is the virus that also prevents IE from working (Tools --&gt; Internet Options --&gt; Connections tab --&gt; LAN Settings --&gt; uncheck &quot;Use a proxy server&quot; to fix that, but that is a lot of work). Whatever you do, though, you will have to repeat each time you start up. Oh, and I use (and dislike) Vista, so your paths might be slightly different.</p>

            <p>I would say no. So far, canons who know about the PPC have been either a) god-like beings, or b) Gaspode the Wonder-Dog. The latter works because no one ever listens to Gaspode anyway, so who&#39;s he going to tell? It&#39;s funny and not a security breach.<br><br>There is another way, in that sometimes characters who are particularly resistant to Suefluence (e.g. Elrond, Gimli, Eowyn) sometimes vaguely recognize PPC Agents as such, but that&#39;s only due to the canon being warped by the Sue. Once the Sue goes away, they are neuralyzed and forget all about it (until next time). However, I don&#39;t think Batman would fall into that category, since I doubt if he would tend to be either ignored or vilified in Suefic, like the aforementioned examples.<br><br>One thing to keep in mind is that the PPC&#39;s stated goal is to protect the plot continuum from outside disturbances. Knowing about the PPC could potentially BE an outside disturbance (extreme example: the Assimilation Crisis), so it&#39;s in everyone&#39;s best interests that the PPC remain incognito. On the other hand, if a character knowing about us would be funny and not upset the balance of power in the universe, there&#39;s no reason why not.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

<li>Two, I think.<br><br>2. LotR misspellings will be mini-Balrogs; Stargate Atlantis misspellings will be mini-Wraiths. Also: ouch, that sounds like a really bad idea. What were the Ancients thinking? &gt;.<br>3. I don&#39;t think explicit permission is needed. The nature of minis is that they pop up when a name is misspelled in fanfiction, so mini owners, especially those with common misspellings, should probably expect theirs to go missing from time to time. Anyway, on a purely ex-universe note, it would be really tedious to track someone down every time an owned mini came up. I wouldn&#39;t bother.<br><br>~Neshomeh</li>

            <p>First up LOTR misspellings would be Mini-Balrogs, either new ones or ones which have been kidnapped from their owners! I believe those ones can find their own way home, but other people may have different ideas.<br><br>I&#39;m guessing that if the character is usually just called Ronon then it is one mini, but if (s)he is always Ronon Dax in speech then I&#39;d guess at two.

            <p>Let&#39;s see. Animorphs, Lord of the Rings, Chronicles of Narnia, Buffyverse, Star Wars, Star Trek, House, D&amp;D (including novels and role-play), various dystopian novels (ex., The Giver trilogy, Fahrenheit 451, 1984, Uglies trilogy and sequels), The Dresden Files, Ender&#39;s Game, musicals (especially Les Miserables and Cats), and many individual books that I&#39;m probably forgetting, mostly fantasy and sci-fi with a few &quot;classics&quot; mixed in.<br><br>I don&#39;t do romance. It&#39;s boring. Other than that, I&#39;m pretty much an obsessive reader. I&#39;m actually more likely to have read novelizations than seen the TV shows even when something is primarily on TV (Buffy and Star Trek, for example), which is partly because I don&#39;t own a TV set. I was an LotR fan before they thought of the movies; I got hooked in 1998 with The Hobbit.<br><br>...why, do they make you pick just one continuum? :P<br><br>If I had to decide, I&#39;ve only ever written fan fiction for Animorphs and LotR, and LotR and Narnia are the ones I know best (though I can quote D&amp;D rules and show tunes with the best of &#39;em).</p>

Anyway, if you really <i>want</i> to talk quietly, you can use &lt;small&gt; tags to make your text look <small>like this</small>. Just make sure to close your message or passage with a &lt;/small&gt; tag. In fact, all (or almost all) html works on the board. You can see everything <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/tags/default.asp">here</a>. And take a bladed yo-yo. This one comes with edge guards.</p>

            <p>I&#39;d kind of like a badfic in my original canon. One of my agent&#39;s would enjoy returning to his continuity, but he doesn&#39;t know all the coordinates. A bacfic is (I think) the only way to get the Flowers to give them to him. Plus, it would be fun to see how he reacts. Tell me if you&#39;re interested, but I have a feeling that you&#39;d want more information about the canon before you start breaking the rules the world uses (ironic, isn&#39;t it?) I&#39;ll get working on <a href="http://fairylandfiction.wikia.com">the wiki</a>, and everything on <a href="http://goldenrod111.livejournal.com/1204.html">this list</a> takes place in that canon.</p>

            <p>Hi All,<br><br>I&#39;m sure we all have types of fic that we prefer to steer clear of. Certain types of AU which are very difficult to write well, or particular plot points which we do not often find realistic. Maybe particular pairings which, for whatever reason, fail to ignite a spark of interest.<br><br>But there are always exceptions! <br><br>For myself I&#39;m not a fan of OFC&#39;s. Nowadays I seldom even look at fics which advertise themselves as containing and OC, especially an OC/established canon character pairing. I have read &quot;Don&#39;t Panic&quot; by Boz4PM (<a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/1690622/1/Dont_Panic"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/1690622/1/Dont_Panic">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/1690622/1/Dont_Panic</a></a>), and loved it, but usually I only read such stories in the Thunderbirds fandom where I myself do most of my writing. This is simply because I feel more confident writing concrit in a fandom which I actually write than I do in one where I have a good working knowledge, but no practical experience so to speak.<br><br>I have however found a couple of really enjoyable stories recently which feature OFC&#39;s who are real characters, not cardbord cut-outs. Both are Transformers fics (my current fandom of choice).<br><br>For safety I&#39;d say both are probably NSFW, but YMMV<br><br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4819959/1/Odd_Couple"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4819959/1/Odd_Couple">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4819959/1/Odd_Couple</a></a> by Demyrie which features human!Transformers which is also something I don&#39;t usually enjoy, but absolutly love in this fic. <br>*WARNING* Contains non-explicit Slash!<br><br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4214776/1/Screaming_Blue_Murder"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4214776/1/Screaming_Blue_Murder">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4214776/1/Screaming_Blue_Murder</a></a> by Keaalu which has lots of really well written OFC&#39;s, and a great plot.<br><br>Now I&#39;d be the first to admit that I can be a bit hidebound with what I will and will not read, I&#39;ll frequently click the back button after just one paragraph of clunky prose, but I&#39;m trying to be rather more open minded.<br><br>So what fics have you discovered and enjoyed which you would perhaps not usually have read because they contain things which put you off?<br><br>I await responses with interest!</p>

            <p>Pardon my messy links...I don&#39;t know how to do those nice links that only show the titles on this site.  Any advice?<br><br>1.  &quot;Department of Archives&quot; <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4432749/1/Department_of_Archives"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4432749/1/Department_of_Archives">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4432749/1/Department_of_Archives</a></a><br><br>A really good Nolanverse Batman fic, which is, unfortunately, updated slowly.  It involves an OFC who eventually falls in love with Batman, but the romance is very well done and un-contrived.<br><br>2.  &quot;The Greymarch&quot; <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4566461/1/The_Greymarch"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4566461/1/The_Greymarch">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4566461/1/The_Greymarch</a></a><br><br>Excellent story from the Redwall universe.  Set in a land far north of Mossflower, this harrowing tale details the struggle of two young creatures trying to defend their home against the onslaught of a terrible enemy.  I thought that a dragon could never be put in a Redwall fic without jumping the shark.  I was bloody frickin&#39; wrong.<br><br>3.  &quot;Spare Me These Unending Trials&quot; <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3856634/1/Spare_Me_These_Unending_Trials"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3856634/1/Spare_Me_These_Unending_Trials">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3856634/1/Spare_Me_These_Unending_Trials</a></a><br><br>A Pirates of the Caribbean/Phantom of the Opera crossover...that *works.*  The most angsty characters of both series...Erik and Davy Jones...switch places in a hilarious turn of events.  Jones turns up in the Opera Populaire, where he is cast in the lead role of an opera about the Flying Dutchman, and he falls in love with a certain ballet mistress.  Erik ends up captain of the Dutchman, and annoys his crew by making them sing.  Snarky hilarity ensues.<br><br>4.  Any of the Cat-Tales by Chris Dee, seen here: <a href="http://catwoman-cattales.com/"><a href="http://catwoman-cattales.com/">http://catwoman-cattales.com/</a></a><br><br>This is a realistic take on the Batman/Catwoman relationship, which not only corrects many of the teenage fanbrats, but also a great many of the idiot canon writers who have managed to mangle Catwoman&#39;s character over the years.  Smart, sassy, and sarcastic, these stories are a great read that will suck you in until the very end (alliteration: ah doez et).</p>

            <p>Had to think about it for a while, but:<br><br>1) <i>Harry Potter</i>: &quot;<a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/555351/1/Wings">Wings</a>&quot; by Claudia3 is a Snape/Hermione fic. Normally this would raise all kinds of issues, but this author handles them really well in that a) Hermione is of age and working as a professor, and b) she actually <i>addresses</i> the issues that remain. Oh, and there&#39;s an actual plot. AU by necessity, considering that it was written in 2004.<br><br>2) <i>Phantom of the Opera</i>: &quot;<a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2013745/1/The_Patron_of_the_Opera">The Patron of the Opera</a>&quot; by Mereidia contains an OFC who *gasp* <i>doesn&#39;t</i> fall in love with the Phantom! Practically a miracle in the fandom.<br><br>3) I&#39;ll mention the <i>Animorphs</i> fic &quot;<a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3464631/1/Sacred_Host">Sacred Host</a>&quot; by Qoheleth again, which I would normally avoid due to its OFC and a hefty dose of religion. However, the author&#39;s style and the force of story overcame those things for me, and I&#39;m quite enjoying it.<br><br>Except for the last one, I read these stories years ago, so my remembered perceptions from then may not match up with yours now. *shrug*<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I generally steer clear of OCs unless they&#39;re minor supporting characters, but, as you said, there are always exceptions. For instance, and Yu-Gi-Oh fanfic by this guy:<br><br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/u/574797/Cyber_Commander"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/u/574797/Cyber_Commander">http://www.fanfiction.net/u/574797/Cyber_Commander</a></a><br><br>He does entirely original generation characters, so it&#39; just comes off as, well, another season of the show. I especially like that he concentrates on, you know, the Dueling, rather than hot oiled-up men boffing like you usually find in YGO fics. It&#39;s not without its flaws, but what fanfic is? In particular, there&#39;s a rather WTF scene toward the end of one where the big bad, a demoness, suddenly launches into a tirade about how she created party politics and every political controversy is literally from Hell.<br><br>But it&#39;s nothing major, and shouldn&#39;t distract from genuine excitement at what&#39;s coming next.</p>

            <p>I normally won&#39;t read stuff with OC&#39;s in it, but both of these are wonderful stories.  They are both entirely told from the POV of the OC&#39;s, and yet still manage to be about the canon characters.  This author also manages to really keep the canons in character.  She has many other stories.  I have read most of her Stargate Atlantis stories, and liked them, but these stand out in my memory as particularly good.  I like long stories, so the second one is more my style at just over 100,000 words.

            <p>Time travel fics, to me, can get too cheesy, and generally come across as a half-assed excuse for pairing up characters who either don&#39;t exist at the same time, or who are so far apart in age that it would otherwise be quite squicky.<br><br>&quot;Stray&quot; by Dahne (<a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2711502/1/Stray"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2711502/1/Stray">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2711502/1/Stray</a></a>), on the other hand, is a nice Metal Gear Solid time-travel fanfic that manages to be a good read, if a bit long-winded at times. It also contains another of my avoided things, multiple popular culture references, but it does these in a subtle fashion.<br><br>A couple of chapters are NSFW. It contains lampshaded technobabble and Otacon/MGS3-era Ocelot slash. It&#39;s also some 78 chapters long.</p>

            <p>I happen to enjoy most of the stuff by Jael the Scribe, over on the Pit (and on Henneth Anun, which is a really good reference!).<br>My favorite of hers is probably <a href="http://localhost:3000/posts/scrape/2010/www.fanfiction.net/s/3074558/1/To_Wrap_An_Elven_Princeling"> To Wrap an Elven Princeling</a>. I normally avoid anything that says it has Thranduil and Legolas in it together as a father-son relationship because it&#39;s either a) an Elektra relationship (incest, for those who don&#39;t read Greek myth), b) Thranduil&#39;s an abusive jackass, or c) Legolas&#39;s father is someone else entirely (see <a href="http://localhost:3000/posts/scrape/2010/www.fanfiction.net/u/175451/wednesday-mc">wednesday-mc</a> on the pit for an example of about three of the aforementioned ideas...

            <p>In other fandoms (since you did ask) there&#39;s a story in Kingdom Hearts fandom that involves a) High school AU, b) slash citrus (which I normally have no issue with, but this fandom is notorious for bad slash), c) a primary pairing (Riku/Sora) I don&#39;t support.

            <p>As some of you know from the chatroom, the RP I&#39;ve been working on,<a href="http://marysueacademy.proboards.com/index.cgi"> St Dymphna&#39;s Academy</a><a>, is a Mary Sue RP.<br><br>What does this mean, you might be wondering?<br><br>It means all the characters are Mary Sues or Marty Stus. In a school filled with them.<br><br>You could make a character who is going to try and eliminate everyone else they see as a threat to their obvious superiority, someone who sees it as awesome and decides to work towards being the best with ~*~*~everyone~*~*~, one driven off the edge into madness by not being special anymore, or just play your MS character straight- accepting consequences.<br><br>Both teacher and student applications are being accepted until 16 May if anyone is interested in joining. :D</a></p>
