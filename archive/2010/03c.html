            <p>Hi.  My name is Italian for Grandma.  I&#39;m not really a grandma (since I&#39;m like, nineteen...) and I&#39;m not completely Italian...it&#39;s a long story about a convoluted family nickname.  The penname works though, so yippee!<br><br>I&#39;ve been a silent fan of the PPC series for a while now, and I wanted to get a little more involved.  So I posted a few new entries for the Unclaimed Badfic list (Redwall section) on the Wiki.  Then I was directed here.  I might decide to write a spin-off of my own, or I might remain a lurker...but either way, I thought it would be nice to know what all&#39;s going on.<br><br>So...hm, ran out of material there...what to end the post with, hmmmm...<br><br>ALOHA!  *shrugs*  I guess that works...</p>

            <p>I am anticipating/hoping for a series of last-minute entries (including my own), so I&#39;d like people to put them all in replies to this thread to avoid Board Clutter. {= )<br><br>Anyway! We&#39;ve reached the end of March, and I&#39;m already really excited by the number of people who wrote something for my challenge. As of right now, I&#39;ve already got eighteen spots on my list of people who are getting prizes. Eighteen! In one month! That&#39;s really cool, you guys. Congratulations! {= D<br><br>For the rest of you, there&#39;s still time! You have until your time zone&#39;s midnight to post something for the win!<br><br>However, <b>some of you have not told me what prizes you want</b>, and I won&#39;t wait forever. As I&#39;ve said before, I intend to do the prizes in order, so it is important that I know what I&#39;m doing. If you want to pass, that&#39;s fine, but please TELL ME so I can sort out what I&#39;m doing when and not have any excuse to flail around and be distracted from doing this! I&#39;m giving you until this thread falls off the Board, and if I haven&#39;t heard from you by then I&#39;m going to have to write you off so I can move on. {= ( I don&#39;t want to do that to anyone, so please respond.<br><br>Here&#39;s the full list, in case you&#39;re not sure who you are:<br><br>1. Trojie - ???<br><br>2. Miah - ???<br><br>3. Bronwyn - drawing of plushie!Bryn<br><br>4. Maslab - drawing of ???<br><br>5. Makari - drawing of Samuel<br><br>6. Elcalion - drawing of Logan<br><br>7. JulyFlame - drawing of a meeting of the Board of Flowers<br><br>8. Derrick - drawing Barid &amp; Brightbeard<br><br>9. Rosie Azrael - ???<br><br>10. Meip - ???<br><br>11. Goldenrod - beta for &quot;A Shadow on Padded Feet&quot;<br><br>12. Pit Viper - ???<br><br>13. Cassie - drawing of Cara, William, and Stephanie<br><br>14. KGarrett - drawing of ???<br><br>15. Terrofen - ???<br><br>16. hS - ???<br><br>17. IndeMaat - beta for next NCIS mission<br><br>18. Laburnum - ???<br><br>I believe I have everyone and that the list is in order. Let me know if I&#39;m wrong or if I&#39;ve missed anyone.<br><br>Also, <b>if you have requested/are going to request a drawing</b>, and you&#39;re not Makari, you need to send me an e-mail with a description of what you want (and yes, you can attach reference images too if you like). This is so that everything is in one place, to help keep me focused, not because I don&#39;t know how to use the Wiki. Plus, the Wiki can&#39;t tell me anything specific like pose, or setting, or items you really want included, or the kind of feeling you&#39;re looking for in the image. I want to know these things! I thrive on details!<br><br>My e-mail is exswyzie14 (at) yahoo (dot) com, with the obvious substitutions. If you&#39;re on the list for a drawing and I don&#39;t hear from you, I will hunt you down. {= p<br><br>Now, I&#39;ve got to go clean up my own entry and get it online. See you back here!<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>But that IS what they are, so I don&#39;t know why you wouldn&#39;t call them that. I mean, I suppose you could say &quot;Assassin Thorntree&quot; or &quot;Untangler Ilraen,&quot; but that gets a bit cumbersome and/or weird when it comes to other action departments. No one would ever say &quot;Bad Slasher Trojanhorse&quot; or &quot;Floater July&quot; or &quot;Spy Architeuthis,&quot; for example.<br><br>I suppose the infrastructure departments make for some exceptions, but even then--in FicPsych, for example--it wouldn&#39;t be <i>wrong</i> to refer to one of their personnel as Agent Whoever even though they&#39;re normally called Nurse Whoever. All PPC employees <i>are</i> agents of the PPC, even if they aren&#39;t <i>called</i> that.

I just don&#39;t like the ring of &quot;Agent Suit&quot; and referring to someone constantly as &quot;The [Noun]&quot; can be a bit unmanageable, as I&#39;ve found in writing other stories. I use &quot;Mr. Suit&quot; as one of my aliases to correct this problem. Simply put, I am curious as to whether or not &quot;Mr. Suit&quot; would be an acceptable agent name. I thought about including here a mini-story explaining a first meeting with the Marquis de Sod, but I haven&#39;t read anything with him(it?) in it and don&#39;t want to write poorly for him.</p>

Also, I got around to reading Introducing Ilraen, and I feel that I must complement you on your work.

            <p>*poke*<br><br>I don&#39;t know what you&#39;ve already read, of course, but there are a few things you should definitely make time for. First, there is the <a href="http://www.misssandman.com/PPC/story.html">Original PPC Series</a> by Jay and Acacia. It is our canon and that which started it all.<br><br>Second, we require that everyone read and abide by the <a href="http://twistedskein.webs.com/PPCHome/Constitution.htm">Board Constitution</a>, because it&#39;s nicer that way.<br><br>After that, there are several helpful documents on the Wiki designed to help acquaint newcomers with us and our habits and behaviors and general weirdness. Sedri&#39;s <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Guide_to_the_PPC">Guide to the PPC</a> is particularly informative, especially when combined with the <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/FAQ:_For_Newbies">FAQ for Newbies</a> and the <a href="03c%3Fuser_id=16.html">Mission Writing Guide</a>. If you do want to write PPC missions, you should also see the article about how to get <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Mission_Writing_Guide">Official Permission</a>.<br><br>And that&#39;s probably quite enough to start with. {= ) Welcome!

            <p>*poke*<br><br>I don&#39;t know what you&#39;ve already read, of course, but there are a few things you should definitely make time for. First, there is the <a href="http://www.misssandman.com/PPC/story.html">Original PPC Series</a> by Jay and Acacia. It is our canon and that which started it all.<br><br>Second, we require that everyone read and abide by the <a href="http://twistedskein.webs.com/PPCHome/Constitution.htm">Board Constitution</a>, because it&#39;s nicer that way.<br><br>After that, there are several helpful documents on the Wiki designed to help acquaint newcomers with us and our habits and behaviors and general weirdness. Sedri&#39;s <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Guide_to_the_PPC">Guide to the PPC</a> is particularly informative, especially when combined with the <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/FAQ:_For_Newbies">FAQ for Newbies</a> and the <a href="03c%3Fuser_id=16.html">Mission Writing Guide</a>. If you do want to write PPC missions, you should also see the article about how to get <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Mission_Writing_Guide">Official Permission</a>.<br><br>And that&#39;s probably quite enough to start with. {= ) Welcome!

            <p>Have you read the X-Wing series?  I have several other Star Wars books sitting on my to be read shelf, but I haven&#39;t gotten around to them.  I don&#39;t want to start not at the beginning of a series, and somehow I always seem to end up with books 2 and 3 of a trilogy, or some such nonsense.<br><br>I have read the Han Solo Trilogy several times, the Corellian trilogy, and the original Han Solo trilogy.  The books for episodes 1, 4, 5, and 6 and the books that are set just after each of those.  And of course the whole X-Wing series.  My favorite quote of all time comes from there.<br><br>&quot;Pretty,&quot; Donos said.  &quot;What do we blow up first?&quot; Star Wars X-Wing: Solo Command, Aaron Allston.<br><br>I love that.    It seems like something that would fit DoGA pretty good.<br><br>Unless there has been a new Talent book come out this year then I am up on them.  I am still behind on Pern, though.  I have only read two of the ones Todd McCaffrey has been in on.  I liked the one about the watch weyrs.  Though, I have heard that some people didn&#39;t like that the focus was not on the dragons.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m kind of the opposite, I liked the Wraith Squadron Allston books a bit better.  I haven&#39;t ever gotten up to the NJO books.  I keep meaning to, but there are so many series out there to read that it keeps getting pushed back.</p>

            <p>I liked <i>Dragon&#39;s Kin</i>, personally. <i>Dragonsblood</i> not so much. I couldn&#39;t bring myself to read any of his other ones, especially the one that re-uses the dragon plague plot. He really kinda failed the first time, between the awful genetics and the questionable time-travel thing and the Redwall-esque Conveniently-Placed Plot Device. {X P<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>You didn&#39;t miss much. I, unfortunately, have an annoying lack of ability to stop partway through a book. If it wasn&#39;t published and accepted as canon, it is the kind of story that could be getting a visit from the DoMS. I&#39;m not sure how far you read (or how much I remember), but the main character seemed like a borderline Sue, there was no lack of Cute Animal Friends, the initial stolen plot of a dragon&#39;s plague was, to my knowledge, not solved at the end of the book, the weyrwomen and weyrleaders&#39; order of dominance has been switched from the original trilogy, and Todd has also stolen the idea of sending a group back in time to train before threadfall. I enjoy the series, especially the later books, but this is <i>not</i> a good addition to it.</p>

            <p>I think you are talking about Dragonsblood? I was actually talking about Dragonheart, but, now that I have looked them up, they both seem to deal with a plague. Dragons certainly seem susceptible for a creature designed for resilience, don&#39;t they? I have read everything in the series, but, sometimes luckily, don&#39;t remember everything in it. If I remember correctly, Dragonheart is the worst, and I think that I remember that I wasn&#39;t impressed by Dragonsblood. Despite not remembering much of Todd&#39;s books, I would recommend staying with the ones before he took over. He just doesn&#39;t seem to be as good with Pern. Anyway, have you read anything else by Anne? I have read and mostly enjoyed the first Doona, Petaybee, and Acorna books. The Petaybee one, at least, even seemed to be slightly better than Pern.</p>

            <p>I love the Petaybee trilogy.  I have read most of the Acorna books, the Talent series, and the shell people books.  I own most of the Pern series, except the newest ones.  The more you all talk about the Dragonsblood book, the more it sounds familiar.  I guess that I did read the whole thing.  It just was not memory worthy.  ;)</p>

            <p>Sounding familiar is not a guarantee of having read one of Todd McCaffery&#39;s solo books. He steals enough stuff from Anne that they seem familiar even while you read them for the first time. The one thing that he forgot to take was the cure for the dragon plague in <i>Dragonheart</i>. Instead, he ended it with Fiona (since when has that been a Pernese name?) and some male dragonrider declaring their love for each other. <i>How does that help cure a plague?</i> I understand (kind of) having that part in the middle of the book, but as the final scene? <i>What was he thinking?</i><small>&lt;/rant&gt;</small></p>

            <p>That sounds like the summary (I don&#39;t remember enough of the book itself) of <i>Dragon Harper</i>. I was talking about the solo book he wrote even more recently, <i>Dragonheart</i>. In that one, the dragons are suffering a plague <i>again</i> which is believed to be carried by fire lizards <i>again</i>, so a group of young dragonriders goes back in time <i>again</i>. A little originality wouldn&#39;t hurt, Todd.</p>

            <p>I&#39;ll check out the Freedom series if I remember. I think I remember enjoying the less dragon-oriented books more. Variety is the spice of life, I guess. I agree that Pern is a great world. My favorites are the one where life seems to continue beyond the books, and I like the Fourth World series (mostly unremarkable, though I like the feel of the final book) for the same reason. Canon Sues do seem to be more difficult to find when most of the cast is borderline. Acorna (at least in the book I read) didn&#39;t seem incredibly different than most female main characters in Pern, but her Sueishness is more obvious.</p>

            <p><a href="http://pottersues.livejournal.com">Potter Sue of the Day</a> regularly holds the Golden Bubotuber Awards, picking out the worst of the worst of the fanfics they find. The awards have such categories as &quot;Worst Title&quot;, &quot;Most Implausible Premise&quot;, &quot;Worst Prose&quot;, &quot;Silliest Name&quot;, &quot;Most OOC Canon Character&quot;, and &quot;Most Quotable Line&quot;. Everyone nominates their favourites, and then everyone votes for the winner in each category. I thought we could do something like that, except we have a much broader range of fics to choose from :) Any fic can be nominated for as many categories as you think it can fit in.<br><br>The full list of categories and rules is here: <a href="http://pottersues.livejournal.com/637226.html"><a href="http://pottersues.livejournal.com/637226.html">http://pottersues.livejournal.com/637226.html</a></a></p>

            <p>Reminds me, I&#39;ve figured out a workaround for the fic I wanted to spork but didn&#39;t fit with my Bad Slashers - L&amp;F can be trying out for a transfer to the Floaters, and they can do it. Simples <sup>_^</sup> Though now I&#39;m not entirely sure if it counts as sporkable - the characters are comparatively IC, but the dialogue is so appallingly inappropriate I was creasing up with laughter through the whole thing. (This is possible even when the characters are IC. One of them is a ditz who overuses prescription medication and rambles when he talks, so babbling dialogue when he&#39;s frightened is perfectly IC. However, the RANDOM OVEREMPHASIS! WITH UNNECCESARY EXCLAMATION POINTS! rendered the whole thing laughable even though it was supposed to be dramatic.)</p>

            <p>Or maybe seven... or eight... or, conceivably, as many as nineteen, depending on how you split them up.<br><br>1/ About two years ago the Board collaborated to make a PPC Soundtrack (or at least a listing of tracks).

If anyone actually puts these together into real-life CDs, I&#39;ll be awestruck.<br><br>2/ Two years ago (in March, actually) was the fifth anniversary of the PPC Posting Board being founded in its present form. To commemorate the occasion, we had a 24-hour all-Board RP, with (impressively) not a single out-of-character post being made during the day. I started to write it up, but... yep, didn&#39;t finish. Now I have.<br><br><a href="http://ppchistory.webs.com/5AnniPart1.htm">The Fifth Anniversary Celebration</a>, very kindly beta&#39;d by Neshomeh.

You can read the whole thing on the Tangled Webs site, which also hosts cast lists, backstories and timelines. Thanks go to Tawaki for prodding me into finishing it.<br><br>But that&#39;s not the end of the history of the PPC. I&#39;m proud (?) to announce the launch of a new (well, it&#39;s been up for a while, but I don&#39;t think I announced it) site: <a href="http://twistedskein.webs.com/">The Twisted Skein</a>, host to my non-canonical PPC stories. They&#39;re consistent with each other and with my previous work, but they&#39;re mostly set in the future; I&#39;m not going to dictate what <i>will</i> happen, just what <i>might</i>. Specifically, the Skein is host to the following works:<br><br>4/ <a href="http://twistedskein.webs.com/EndTitle.htm">The End of the Beginning</a>, a multi-part work which forms a sequel to Crashing Down and spans nearly seventy years of PPC history. It&#39;s almost complete -- the only thing missing is the first part. Since it&#39;s a collection of related stories rather than a series of chapters, that&#39;s not too tragic.<br><br>5/ <a href="http://twistedskein.webs.com/TimeTitle.htm">Time Will Decide For Us</a>, a new, somewhat-shorter-than-my-previous-work story (there will be four or five parts eventually) set around the year 2070 HST. Only the prologue is up, but it should give a taste of what&#39;s to come.<br><br>As a note to the above two items:<br><br>5.5/ The Twisted Skein also has a <a href="http://twistedskein.webs.com/CastList/CastTitle.htm">Cast Lists</a> page. Only the Family Tree version is complete as yet (the other link leads to an empty placeholder), but it&#39;s still better than nothing if you&#39;re interested. However, it&#39;s no use whatsoever if you&#39;re reading...<br><br>6/ <a href="http://twistedskein.webs.com/MythTitle.htm">Myths of the PPC</a>. In a thousand years (sometimes I think <i>big</i>) the PPC will be changed beyond recognition. However, they should still remember their origins, right? Well, maybe not entirely <i>accurately</i>. If you&#39;ve ever thought that Jay, Acacia, the SO, or even Makes-Things should be deified, this is for you. Hey, even if you just want to know how the term &quot;epic haiku&quot; makes sense, this is still for you.<br><br>Five of the six plugs above are on the twin Tangled Webs/Twisted Skein sites. They&#39;re pretty epic. I recommend them. ;)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Sorry, no disrespect intended, just an observation. Anyway, very well-done, hS, and congratulations on finishing CD! Amusingly enough, I&#39;d been reading the myth stuff just before you plugged it. Still, very enjoyable, though it makes me ponder what the PPC itself is like a thousand years in the future. And what they&#39;re doing, since it doesn&#39;t seem likely to me that people on World One would still be writing fanfics in a thousand years, if there even <i>is</i> a World One any more by then. The pondering aside, thanks; they were all very good reads.</p>

First, there is the <a href="http://www.misssandman.com/PPC/story.html">Original PPC Series</a> by Jay and Acacia. It is our canon and that which started it all.<br><br>Second, we require that everyone read and abide by the <a href="http://twistedskein.webs.com/PPCHome/Constitution.htm">Board Constitution</a>, because it&#39;s nicer that way.<br><br>After that, there are several helpful documents on the Wiki designed to help acquaint newcomers with us and our habits and behaviors and general weirdness. Sedri&#39;s <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Guide_to_the_PPC">Guide to the PPC</a> is particularly informative, especially when combined with the <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/FAQ:_For_Newbies">FAQ for Newbies</a> and the <a href="03c%3Fuser_id=16.html">Mission Writing Guide</a>. If you do want to write PPC missions, you should also see the article about how to get <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Mission_Writing_Guide">Official Permission</a>.<br><br>And that&#39;s probably quite enough to start with. {= ) Welcome!

            <p>Are there any Agents of potentially dangerous species or types?  I have heard mention of vampire Agents, but I have not seen their profiles.  I saw a potential Agent the other day that seemed to be a rather large intelligent bear, but I didn&#39;t know the fandom.  <br><br>Could someone point me in the right direction for learning more about this?  <br><br>There is a character that I think would make a good recruit in the Mission I am working on, but he is a pretty dangerous species.  The personality and characteristics he has been given in the story make him much less dangerous than a normal representative of his species (and would make it a great challenge for him to directly fight one of his own kind, thereby preserving the non-super powered Agent requirement), but I wanted to know more about similar Agents before I tried it.</p>

            <p>You know, I think that people don&#39;t need to worry esspecially about species: I mean, a unique, fallible human seems fine, right? All you need to do is design the agent, give the kid an interesting getup, background story, morals/way of thinking based on this, and some interesting strengths and weaknesses (the weaknesses are important, to make every mission interesting, and to prevent the unintentional spawning of Mary Sues/Gary Stus). <br><br>If you&#39;re worried that if the agent is a human, then the kid won&#39;t be able to have powers, just think: He/she could be a mutant/mutate as part of the Marvel-verse, and/or he/she could end up picking up some sweet toys and gadgets along the way. <br><br>Does that help at all? I&#39;m sorry if this seemed too pedantic and rambly, but what I&#39;m trying to say is: &#39;Why sweat the small stuff? An agent could be Mr Average-freaking-Joe but as long as he can get the job done, and get it done in an interesting, audience-grabbing way that makes people feel for him, then that&#39;s a job well done - just make sure he doesn&#39;t become a Sue/Stu for all of our sakes, or he&#39;ll be toast too.&#39;  </p>

            <p>It is less that I am worried about them being weak (I have two pretty normal human Agents right now), than that I am considering recruiting a specific, non-human character from a badfic that I am working on, and the species is pretty powerful.  They also have, um, unique dietary requirements.  This particular character is written as being unusual enough from the species standard that I think he would be a good Agent-you know not plotting to take over the PPC or secretly eating other Agents--but I wasn&#39;t sure how the more powerful Agents were handled.  <br><br>It seems from all the links I got that they are primarily assigned to fics that have very powerful Sues or particularly dangerous canons, so that their inherit power is barely enough to survive, just like a human in the less power based canons.<br><br>In fact, this character may be best used in a more powerful canon than what I typically read.  Even without the typical bloodthirsty bad attitude and desire to take over everything, he will still have strength, speed, and stamina beyond that of a human, be able to regenerate nearly any injury, and be highly intelligent.  Plus, of course, that special dietary requirement.  *wicked grin*  (I don&#39;t know how to make that smiley)</p>

            <p>As a Zeltron, Cavan has very strong natural empathic talents, which means he can influence a person&#39;s feelings. He also exudes pheremones which make him attractive to others, and when one combines both these abilities, turned up to full throttle, with the Force, it can create a pretty overpowering sensation of physical attraction towards the person. <i>That&#39;s</i> a lust whammy.<br><br>(Lucky for us all he behaves most of the time.)</p>

            <p>Goldenrod explained it pretty well--the only danger of a powerful species is that they&#39;d have it too easy and it wouldn&#39;t be any fun to read about them. However, power can be made up for in any number of ways, such as personality, the Laws of Narrative Comedy, and/or the Ironic Overpower preventing them from getting out of hand.<br><br>For example, my Agent Ilraen-Aroline-Fothergill is an Andalite, which (if you don&#39;t know) is a centaur-like alien with four eyes, no mouth, telepathic speech, and a very fast and wickedly sharp tail-blade. He also has the ability to morph into any species he comes into contact with, which has the potential to get really ridiculous given the access he has as an agent to the powerful races of the multiverse. HOWEVER, due to being &quot;born&quot; in a badfic and getting his personality from sessions in FicPsych, and the fact that he sucks at morphing, he&#39;s kind of a woobie. (He is getting better, though. Character growth and all.)<br><br>Another powerful-yet-fun agent I can think of off the top of my head is <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Verra">Agent Verra Rose</a>, who was a frickin&#39; dragon. I don&#39;t remember precisely how Kippur handled her, but I think she just didn&#39;t go on missions much due to being a wife and mom.<br><br>And then there&#39;s always the option of just not using one&#39;s superpowers. My character Jenni is one of the Powers That Be in her own universe, but the most she&#39;s ever shown of it in HQ is a bit of telepathy. She has Rules.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I read at least one Mission with Ilraen in it.  I wasn&#39;t sure what an Andalite was, but his difficulty with morphing definitely took away from his power potential.  Just curious, what and how do they eat with no mouths?<br><br>After reading Verra&#39;s entry on the wiki, I have read something with her in it.

The thing that bothered me the most about it, other than the idea of a Wraith falling in twu wuv with his food, is that this character has nothing in common with the character that is supposed to be in the story--Todd.  He is a rather cool mostly bad guy, who has many distinguishing features.  None of the them are present in this story, and the Suethor messes up the descriptions that are supposed to identify him.<br><br>He doesn&#39;t have a name, really.  Inside the story, he is never named at all.  In the description, it says he is supposed to be Todd.  I have been referring to him as Not!Todd, so I figure he will want to pick a new name.<br><br>These are the traits that he has been given in the story:  His personality is really that of a large pussycat.  He has no ambition to take over the world.  He likes to read. Wears his hair in a braid and enjoys it being brushed.  Is very quiet, and has tattoos running down each side of his face and body.  He also has sharp ridges of bone running the length of his spine.  Is thoughtful of others, but emotionally distant in actual interactions.  Has an apparent weakness for falling in love with Sues.  Removed from the Sue influence he might revert toward more typical responses.<br><br>The Wraith:  Typical characteristics.<br><br>They are life-force sucking space vampires, with bad teeth, white to green, sometimes slimy looking skin, cat-like pupils, and bad attitudes.  They have a feeding slit on their right hand, which they slam into the victim&#39;s chest.  They then inject an enzyme which keeps the victim alive longer, and proceed to suck the life out the victim until it is a dried up, mummified looking, husk.  Their is a canon formula, if you can steal it from Michael-the most dangerous individual enemy they have in canon-that would turn him into a hybrid that retains most of the wraith biological advantages with no feeding slit, and the ability to utilize normal food.<br><br>The wraith are organized similar to an insect hive (they evolved from Iratus bug DNA mixing with human DNA).  They have a queen, sometimes one per ship-which are called hives, sometimes one for several ships with male subordinates in charge of the ones with no Queens.  The males come in two varieties--intelligent Lieutenant types, and drones that don&#39;t even have fully formed faces.  The drones are cloned and grown to full adult size in very little time.  The Lieutenants are born much younger (it never really says if they are physically born through gestation, though it hints that they may not be.  I&#39;d have to watch certain Season 4 episodes again to be more sure on this) and spend time as children who eat normal food.  At puberty all human systems shut down.  They are capable of swallowing food, with difficulty, but they are not able to draw sustenance from it.  <br><br>I cannot think of a single time in canon when one of the wraith wore all their hair in a braid.  It does seem like I might have seen some micro braids hanging down by the face, like in the sideburns, and in the little wispy beards they keep.  They wear copious amounts of black leather-usually in trench coats, pants, and maybe shirts (the coats are usually buttoned at the top), and large boots.  They come equipped with a self destruct device.  They can frequently read Ancient in addition to Wraith, but I wouldn&#39;t expect any of them to be reading English, with the possible exception of the real Todd.<br><br>They are very intelligent and have very advanced technology.  Their technology is organically based.  Their ships are literally grown from a seed placed inside a sentient host.  I believe they have excellent night vision, as their ships are always very dimly lit.  They maintain the humans of the Pegasus Galaxy as cattle herds.  They cull their herds by flying over in ships, called darts.  They shoot out beams of light which picks up and stores people.  When the people are rematerialized, they are heavily sedated as part of the process, which makes it much easier to put them in either the storage pods (like the Wraith version of a fridge), or into the holding cell where they hold the few they want to eat immediately.  The storage pods are very slimy.<br><br>The Wraith have huge regenerative properties.  If they are properly fed, they will never die of natural causes.  They have huge numbers of hibernation pods on their ships, and will spend between 100-500 years at a time sleeping, with only a few guardians.  <br><br>They can make you see shadows of things that aren&#39;t really there.  They can also use some sort of mental link to contact their hive if they are stranded or captured.  It has a pretty short distance, in that it doesn&#39;t reach across the galaxy. <br><br>They do sometimes keep worshipers, but the sole canon purpose was for the worshipers to infiltrate and gain intel on the societies that could be gaining potentially dangerous levels of technology, or to sort of try to charm info out of captives.  Spies in other words.  The worshipers are addicted to the Wraith feeding enzyme.  The Wraith are able to give life force to a human or other Wraith, if they really want to, and they have the energy to give.  The enzyme is highly addictive in large quantities, and has other interesting side effects, such as increased strength, stamina, and speed.  It also lowers inhibitions, increases violence and is generally bad for you when coming off of it.<br></p>

            <p>Seems like he has the potential to be a great agent, and someone that would “work” with mine! Unfortunately, I know nothing about his canon and am afraid that I would just mangle his uncanonical personality. I was thinking that there might be a chance that I knew the canon, or that it was something that I could pick up relatively quickly, but I don&#39;t do well with television series (I know a few, but they are not something that I can watch for the sole purpose of learning the canon).

[url=<a href="http://www.freewebs.com/bonsaimallorn3/Echoespart1.htm%5DHere%5B/url">http://www.freewebs.com/bonsaimallorn3/Echoespart1.htm]Here[/url</a>], for example, it&#39;s less about Agent Selene being a vampire, and more about her having a crossbow aimed at someone&#39;s head.  I think <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Keth">one Agent</a> did get in a lot of trouble for letting a were-sea-anemone run around during a full moon, but the death toll from that still wasn&#39;t much higher than someone going &quot;Mr Rogers!&quot;</p>

            <p>It&#39;s a young-adult series by K. A. Applegate (and her stable of ghostwriters). Follows the adventures of five probably-high-school-aged kids and a bit later their alien buddy as they combat the silent invasion of the Yeerks, a race of slug-like, brain-invading, mind-controlling aliens. They can do this because an Andalite warrior, Elfangor, crash-landed in front of them whilst taking a shortcut home from the mall and, as he was dying, gave them the ability to morph with that fabulous piece of Andalite technology known as the Escafil device (or morphing cube).<br><br><a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Zan_Holbar">Zan Holbar</a> is also an <i>Animorphs</i> native, but she&#39;s a Hork-Bajir, which is one of the races the Yeerks have already dominated. They&#39;re also rather powerful, being seven feet tall and covered in sharp blades, but normally (i.e. not controlled by a Yeerk) they&#39;re dumb, peaceful, and only use the blades to harvest the tree bark they eat.<br><br><a href="http://neshomeh.deviantart.com/art/Zan-Holbar-47008296">Picture of Zan</a><br><br><a href="http://neshomeh.deviantart.com/art/Ilraen-De-morph-Fail-127555675">Picture of Ilraen</a><br><br>~Neshomeh, who drew&#39;d &#39;em.</p>

            <p>I have seen the books around, but had never read any of them, so I didn&#39;t know how they had gotten their powers.  I might check a few of them out for my youngest boy.

            <p>Does that mean you can have Death Note Shinigami, too? Although, now that I think about it, bringing in a an agent with the power to see the name of anyone that passes by, and who can kill people just by writing in their name into a notebook of death may not make for good reading - the Shinigami are and always have been over-powered. The only documented way to kill them is to make them fall on love with a human, so that if that human&#39;s life is threatened, the shinigami will write the name of the entity posing the threat, causing the loved human&#39;s life to be lengthened, thus killing the shinigami, whose only purpose is to shorten life, not lengthen it. <br><br>Yeah, so &#39;Any species can be an agent...except the Death Note Shinigami, who are killjoys&#39;.

            <p>I am, unfortunately, unable to point you towards those interesting agents, but I do think that I can answer the question about your possible recruit. The way I understand it, the main reasoning against super-powered agents is that it is not any fun to read about someone going into a story, making a list of charges, and killing the Sue/exorcising the author <i>if the agent does so with ease and without suffering.</i> As long as the average fic poses a challenge to the agent, I believe that the agent is not considered too strong. Using this reasoning, if you were worried about how strong an agent is getting, you might be able to rein him in by throwing really bad stories at him. Of course, that assumes that <i>you</i> can withstand a barrage of really-badfics, but you might be able to ease off if you can make your agent get more fragile. It seems like it might be a good idea to plan for this ahead of time, and give your agent some disability when he first arrives. I am going to be using this technique when I start writing--I will have a werewolf character who could probably beat most Sues easily, but who&#39;s mind and morals are threatened by his condition. It&#39;s going to be fun when I get him to snap.<br><br>By the way, I apologize for the length and the somewhat rambling nature of this post. I do that when I start getting tired.</p>

            <p>Three things:<br><br>First off a fairly MST style badfic rant by my friend Dan-chan, which I&#39;m sure you will all enjoy.  Because I have rarely read badfic worse than she found.

It&#39;s set in Bleach, suffers from a sugar overdose but does accurately portray how painfully Sues can warp canon-reality.<br><br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4667732/1/Sparkle_Marysue"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4667732/1/Sparkle_Marysue">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4667732/1/Sparkle_Marysue</a></a> <br><br>And an extract: <br>Yoruichi would never call out her sword, never allow herself to use her supposed &#39;partner&#39; no matter how dire the situation. Wincing she sealed the oath with the binding words, &quot;Mary…sue…&quot;<br><br>--<br><br>&#39;Actually&#39; an angelic voice whispered, so angelic that as she spoke the sun brightened and she received her own styling of font, &#39;my name is Maria Amaya Nefretiri Phoenix Susanna Fire de Pompadour the 4th&#39; Yoruichi&#39;s eye twitched…again. &#39;not &#39;Mary-Sue&#39;<br><br>&quot;See…I would say that but I&#39;d be killed just trying to perform Shikai…&quot;<br><br>And in a nutshell:  &#39;Of course!&#39; Chirped the irritatingly perfect voice; &#39;It is one of my 4,000,000,000 rare powers!&#39;<br><br><br>Finally, although I don&#39;t have the attention span to join missions myself, I thought it might be quite amusing to have an agent who was a captured, semi-tamed Mary Sue that could be pitched against severe cases.  A muzzle and a power-dampening chain should do the trick.  <sup>_<sup><br><br>I&#39;m</sup></sup> afraid I don&#39;t know whether this has been done already.</p>

            <p>I don&#39;t believe we&#39;ve ever starved a Sue and released her at a target--although there is a division for doing experiments on captured Sues, so I could be wrong--but I know some of the milder Sues occasionally get redeemed and join the PPC. I don&#39;t know how exactly that&#39;s done, though.</p>

            <p>Are there any agents other than Lux and the late Makes-Things who are free for anyone to write about?<br><br>I ask because my Bad Slashers would only be familiar with a few fairly limited fandoms, I&#39;ve found a few fics in fandoms they wouldn&#39;t know and/or wouldn&#39;t like which are Bad Slash and have no Sue for my assassins to get, and I don&#39;t particularly want to create more agents from scratch.<br><br>If there aren&#39;t any free agents, I could find a workaround - kitsune106 and I are working on a fic from which our agents are going to take some new recruits, so I could skip ahead a bit with their story and make their agent profiles now.</p>

            <p>How far would the agents have to push the canon characters before they couldn&#39;t help but notice the agents despite the SEP field? I ask because I thought of a scene in one fic I was thinking of sporking where the agents are hiding in a closet, hear the characters say a particularly stupid-sounding line, and fall out of the closet because they&#39;re laughing uncontrollably. I&#39;m not sure whether the characters would notice this. I&#39;m thinking they would, but I thought I&#39;d better ask.</p>

            <p>I think it depends partly on how much the fic is warping the world, and of course on the Rule of Funny, but there are a few things that always work--touching them, for instance--and agents always seem to be able to get their attention when they actually want to. Being really loud right next to them for an extended period of time would probably do it.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>One of the fics I was thinking of sporking is not actually as OOC as most of the stuff we see. The main charge is the horrible, horrible dialogue. (I posted some VERY NWS selections at this LJ if you&#39;re curious:<br><a href="http://community.livejournal.com/badfic_quotes/986364.html"><a href="http://community.livejournal.com/badfic_quotes/986364.html">http://community.livejournal.com/badfic_quotes/986364.html</a></a>) Don&#39;t know if that&#39;s enough to be sporkable, but I was thinking of claiming it until I realised my Bad Slashers would hate that fandom. I considered MSTing it instead, but I honestly can&#39;t think of anything I could say about the quoted lines which would make them any funnier than they already are. It&#39;s like &quot;My Immortal&quot;, it speaks for itself.</p>

            <p>If an agent has a disability, would the disguise generator cause them to no longer have it while they&#39;re disguised? For example, if someone who inherently doesn&#39;t have eyes uses a disguise that does, would the disguise-eyes work, or would they just be for show?</p>

            <p>I think it mostly depends on what would be funnier or cooler. For example, I did a co-mission last year in which one of my Agents, Luke Celinus, appeared. He has an eye missing from an accident several years ago, and his temporary partner (an old friend of his) pranked him to give his disguise two eyes. This led to hilarity as he tried to cope with suddenly having a completely different field of vision again and kept bumping into things.<br><br>Remember, the PPC runs on the Rule of Funny and Rule of Cool.</p>

            <p>So I&#39;m sporking this Star Wars/everything crossover in which Obi-Wan Kenobi is actually Legolas in disguise for...no apparent reason. My question is: what do I do? Will they become two separate characters once the canon reverts to normal, or will I need to do something special? I don&#39;t recall seeing this in any other mission, so I don&#39;t exactly have any guidelines to go off of. Ideas?</p>

            <p>In one story, Arwen had been replaced by Child!Arwen, a Sue who warped Elrond way out of character. They found the original Arwen imprisoned in a nonexistant room on the other side of the plot hole that had allowed Elrond to sip constantly from a glass of wine without ever refilling it. So all you need is to find a plot hole, and the other side could be the prison of the original Legolas and Obi-Wan.</p>

            <p>I&#39;d say he has to be one character or the other, but brainwashed to think he&#39;s both. So, the solution would be neuralyzation and fetching the other character from a plothole. If it&#39;s a very extreme case, such that you&#39;d be wiping his entire memory or something, then you&#39;d probably have to take him to FicPsych to get his personality back.

            <p>I would like to claim the following: iv. &#39;It&#39;s not spelt like that!&#39; [Minis and what to do with them]<br><br>v. We are not alone [Other trans-dimensional organisations – ISPCE, DCPS, even perhaps things like Jurisfiction]<br><br>I might also attempt the blurb, but I don&#39;t think I know enough about the OFUs to try a crack at those. I would also like to try 3.3, &quot;Department of What, Now?&quot;/&quot;Action&quot;, if you wouldn&#39;t mind, of course. I just figured there&#39;d be no harm in asking if I could.</p>

            <p>I kind of agree with July that you tend to spread yourself too thin, so let&#39;s start with &quot;v. We Are Not Alone,&quot; since you&#39;re working with the Society people and I&#39;m sure they&#39;d like to be included. I know another of the things to include there was the Department of Character Protective Services (DCPS), which we decided some time back is a separate sister-organization to the PPC; I believe ISPCE is probably hS&#39;s <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/1504807/1/ISPCE_Protecting_Elves_Everywhere">Interdimensional Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Elves</a>.<br><br>Also, do you know which action departments you want to do descriptions for? There are a lot of them that need them. Maybe you could pick one or two of those to start with?<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>The thing is, we lack people who feel qualified/willing to write the chapters, and the two of us who were on the original Manual Team can&#39;t do it by ourselves. We were actually discussing it not too long ago and had a couple of volunteers, but then there&#39;s the issue of organizing the effort. And... well, frankly the thread fell off the Board, so that kind of ended it at that time.<br><br>But eventually we&#39;ll probably do something about it. And of course, any and all help would be greatly appreciated. You don&#39;t actually have to be all that qualified. For instance, since you just got through the Original Series, you know the basics and therefore are perfectly qualified. If there happen to be details that came later, either I or my editor-in-chief, Huinesoron, will notice and add it in. {= )<br><br>Also, the Manual has an e-mail address: ppc.manual (at) googlemail (dot) com.

            <p>I was just kind of randomly wondering what other people find really, really cute (in anything from fanfic to real World One life). I, myself, love odd or &quot;voluntary&quot; families, situations where a bunch of people come together and end up with parent/children dynamics. (Stormsong, Skyfire and the M kids are sort of an example). And people sleeping together in the G-rated sense, with person A&#39;s head on person B&#39;s shoulder, or lap, or lying down with A&#39;s head on B&#39;s chest or they&#39;re just snuggled together. I think it&#39;s because it shows that they&#39;re really comfortable with each other, and trust each other, but even without analyzing the appeal, I think it&#39;s really cute.<br><br>Now, spill your cute buttons, pretty please - whether they&#39;re big brown eyes or long slimey tentacles?</p>

            <p>Oh, definitely the ferret. Active, intelligent malice trumps just blundering around every time. (Although blundering does a lot too...) Doubly so if she can persuade Moses to do stuff. I&#39;d like to see them pilfer things from the DoGA, but would that conflict the ban on Emergencies? <br>D&#39;you know what Department they&#39;ll be in when they grow up? And is there a minimum age for that?

After Stormsong said that, it was really a race between the pheromones and the Laws of Narrative Comedy, wasn&#39;t it? (Although the Kiern thing was kind of sad.) Hemlock and the bubble gum was great, though - actually, all of that interaction. Is Drake going to encounter Plugg while genderbent? That&#39;d be interesting.</p>

            <p>The youngest agents so far have been thirteen, which makes sense to me because it fits with the 13+ age requirement to use ffnet and LJ. Molly will probably end up being partners with PitViper&#39;s little foxcub Kieran, at least until Moses is old enough - though Kit and I are also rescuing a hermaphroditic cat-person baby in our current mission, which could grow up to be Moses&#39; partner. Not sure which depts they&#39;ll be in. Molly, probably whichever one allows her to kill most things. She might become more Neutral than her current Chaotic behaviour as she gets older (not sure whether she&#39;s Chaotic Neutral or Evil, though), so at least her violence can be directed.<br><br>Poor weasel really should know better by now. I&#39;m not sure whether it&#39;s him or Laburnum who suffers most - the difference seems to be that she brings her suffering on herself, while he just suffers the fallout of everyone else&#39;s messing around.<br><br>Girl!Drake and Plugg should meet, definitely. Plugg&#39;s conflicted about him on more than one level. He&#39;s figured it probably doesn&#39;t count as gay if Drake looks THAT much like a girl even when he is in male form (ah, rationalisation), but Drake&#39;s from the Naruto continuum and therefore counts as a ninja, the pirate&#39;s natural enemy XD XD</p>

            <p>Yes, there are some cute things in Death Note, for example: Near, the albino sheeply-son-of-a-duck; L, in volume 2, when he does the &#39;Bang&#39;, &#39;If I were Kira you&#39;d be dead&#39; and &#39;that the good guys always win&#39; lines (just look at the panels!) and in nearly every volume after and including 5, esp. when he eats the bun, wrapper and all, and then spits out the wrapper with a &#39;bleerr&#39; sound. He&#39;s also pretty cute when he fights with and generally antagonises Light. <br><br>Light has never been considered cute in Death Note, only creepy (although the look on his face when he&#39;d just lost his memory was priceless). I think one of the worst for me concerning him was when he kissed Misa and we got a big profile shot of it. That just traumatised me and put me off girls and hetero fics for months. In fact, I just don&#39;t read those now. Only Yaoi.   <br><br>As for Spirited Away, Yubaba&#39;s baby boy was always cute, even when he threatened to break Chihiro&#39;s (the girl&#39;s) arm.  <br>he was especially cute as a rodent.</p>

            <p>My cute buttons are probably all baby mammals. Even human babies, even though I don&#39;t think they&#39;re so cute after I have to take care of them for a few hours. Ah well. They&#39;re cute for an hour or so, depending on their mood. My other cute buttons are also some canon couples and even some non-canon couples. (Like how I find the canon pairing of LotR&#39;s Sam and Rosie very cute and how I find the non-canon pairing of Neville and Luna from the Harry Potter series also cute as well. I actually probably still like the non-canon pairing simply because I used to think it was canon.)<br>What other things do I find cute? Ladybugs, pandas, stuffed animals, Zero from &quot;Nightmare Before Christmas&quot;, and I could probably go on forever here. </p>

            <p>I&#39;ve been reading through the Original Series like a good little PoDE (Person of Developing Experience), and I come to realize that I had been making badfic my entire life. <br><br>Well, its not strictly badfic, because that&#39;s breaking of the cannon, but I have always looked at books and movies and figured out different ways to bring it to the same conclusion with different variables i.e. crossovers or the inclusion of new characters.<br><br>Quite a little shock, as I had always regarded it as harmless, and it makes me feel sorry for those authors who are unenlightened. I thank my lucky stars that my good friend Ralac instilled a strong respect for CANNON (as he referred to it) a couple years ago.<br><br>We have always been roleplayers, and his ability to conduct a fun RP that maintains the cannon is amazing.<br><br>AS a side note, I&#39;ll be informing him of the PPC.<br><br>So, a little something about myself and now a question.<br><br>Is their any trans-universe science that takes into account the persistence of a Sue? If there is, then I have not found it on the wiki.<br><br>I guess here is an example.<br><br>In order for an Agent to assassinate a Sue this equation must be true.<br><br>Eo*Io<br>Where Eo= the original authors effort, which can be found by this:<br>Length of Story multiplied by the number of new or original characters multiplied by the deviation from a standard badfic (a number that can not be less then 1 or greater then 1.9999999~inf, where 1 equals completely predictable and 2 represents a complete deviation from previous badfic{not possible because it is all based on the authors original work}). <br><br>Eo=L*N*D<br><br>And where Io= the intelligence of the original author, which can be found by this:<br>The amount of grammatical and spelling errata under one.<br><br>Io=1/G<br><br>------------------------------------<br><br>The same thing applies to the authors of the agent&#39;s exploits, except with these changes.<br><br>Ea = the length of the story multiplied by the number of new characters (relative to the badfic and the agents author, so by PPC standards would most often be 2) multiplied by the deviance of the agent&#39;s author&#39;s work from THEIR OWN PREVIOUS ENDEAVORS.<br><br>Ia = the same.<br><br>----------------------------------<br><br>So for an example.<br><br>Larry writes a badfic. His story is fairly lengthy(65), although he only introduces 3 new characters (thank god), but its pretty much like other badfic, so it only gets a deviance score of (1.1). He is not that bright however, and has a few errors on his behalf (lets say 17).<br><br>So, the equation goes as such.<br><br>65 (length) * 3 (characters) * 1.1 (deviation) = 214.5<br>That is his Eo.<br><br>Now his intelligence score is 1/17, so<br><br>214.5 * 1/17 = 12.61 (errors are devastating)<br><br>So, Thoman wants to write a rectification story.<br>Its not as long, only rated at 37 and he uses his standard 2 agents, but he is pretty original with this one and thus gets a 1.4 for deviance. He is smart and spellchecks, leaving only 3 erros in his project.<br><br>37 * 2 * 1.4 = 103.6, not as high as the other raw score, but this is where quality and intelligence come into play.<br><br>103.6 * 1/3 = 34.53~<br><br>Ahh, his final score is much higher then the badfic writers, and his agents are successful in their mission.<br><br>------------------------------------------------------<br><br>This is not random math however. All that really matters are the theories, the numbers themselves can change to whatever is necessary and don&#39;t even have to be &quot;numbers&quot; per say. What this does accomplish:<br><br>*Explains why the PPC doesn&#39;t go after small or weak badfic very often, as it is not much of a numerical threat.<br><br>*Maintains quality, the way the numbers stack, the badfic writer almost always has you outnumbered and the only way you can win is by originality and use of acceptable spelling and grammer.<br><br>*Gives me something to do. I like quantifying things, and even if this is unnecessary, I enjoyed the process. <sup>_<sup><br><br>So,</sup></sup> tell me what you think. Is this too limiting? Does there need to be revisions? Is there even a place for this theory in the PPC? This post is pretty poorly formatted, so if you understand its contents, kudos to you. I also thank you for reading this far (unless you skipped).<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></p>

            <p>I was inspired to create...the Characterization Variation Ratio (C):<br><br>C=(#OOC Canons + #OC&#39;s) ч #Major Canons<br><br>Or, in words:  You add the number of out-of-character canons to the number of original characters.  Then, divide that sum by the number of canons who figure prominently in the fic.  The closer the answer (C) is to zero, the closer the characters in the fic are to their canon selves; the closer to 1 C is, the further from canon they are.<br><br>As an example, let&#39;s use a hypothetical HP badfic which heavily features Harry, Hermione, Ron, Ginny, Dumbledore, Snape, the Weasley twins and a Mary-Sue.  In this fic, the Sue figures things out before Hermione, the twins are fighting over who gets to date the Sue, and Dumbledore is ignoring Harry in favor of some prophecy or other involving the Sue.<br><br>This leaves us with eight canons, four of whom are OOC, and one original character.  For our ratio, this gives us an 8 in the denominator (bottom) and 4 and 1 in the numerator (top).  So C=(4+1)ч8 which simplifies to the fraction 5/8.  This is a little greater than one half, so this fic&#39;s characters, as a whole, are a bit more than halfway against canon.<br><br>If all these canons had been OOC, C would have been 9/8 which is greater than 1, signifying a very OOC group of characters.  If all the canons had been in character, C would be 1/8, which is relatively small, signifying that the Mary-Sue is maybe the only real problem (barring weird occurences in the story itself).<br><br>There are a few things to keep in mind here.  This ratio only takes the characters into account.  Whether or not the story they appear in is good or bad fic depends on how it&#39;s handled; an alternate universe fic could still be goodfic despite having the characters behave differently than in the canon.  Additionally, OC&#39;s may themselves not be Mary Sues or otherwise fit into the canon universe well.  In these cases, you may want to ignore them if they&#39;re bit characters, or even include them as canon characters if they are an important part of the story.  Finally, if the story includes ALL original characters, you may want to split them between canon-friendly and canon-unfriendly, to avoid dividing by zero (mathematically impossible).<br><br>In conclusion, this ratio probably won&#39;t work in every case, and it may be a matter of opinion as to whether any given canon is acting OOC enough to be counted (likewise whether an OC is bad enough).  Still, it&#39;s a relatively quick way to generally determine how far the characters in a fic have fallen from where they should be.</p>

            <p>D seems to be hard to compute, but that&#39;s more of a sidenote than anything.<br><br>There really isn&#39;t any unified science to what we do - we write for fun, we pick targets based on their potential for entertainment, and so on. As what we&#39;re writing really isn&#39;t saving the universes, I don&#39;t see any massive need to enforce rules about what is a valid target and what isn&#39;t.<br><br>That said, multiversal metaphysics are fun. I&#39;ve always thought of a continuum as a sort of a rope - each story is a strand, and they&#39;re generally heading in the same direction. Badfics deviate from that in some dimensional space (as characterizations are at least several dimensions each), and thus weaken the story line. What we do is running around pruning badfics, keeping storylines at least roughly in line.<br><br>Also, I&#39;d like to note that there&#39;s a difference between deviating from the canon and badfic. There was one fic I read in which the West was North America, history continued about as it has (with the elves hiding when Columbus et all arrived), and the various characters from LoTR reincarnated at some future, post-nuclear-war point. Obviously, said fic couldn&#39;t touch the events of canon with a ten-foot pole, but  it was goodfic. The biggest complaint I had with it was the amount of angsting that Arwen did.<br><br>(And yes, it is &#39;canon&#39; with a single n. A &#39;cannon&#39; is a large gun, a &#39;canon&#39; is the body of work that is agreed upon as official for any story.)</p>

            <p>Yes, I had already figured out that D would be troublesome.<br><br>I know that the point is to be free and creative, placing no limits on the writer so that they can craft what they want, that IS no point of fiction. But some people like a good limitation here or there, and writing within limitations can certainly be more interesting at times. These are not rules for what is a target and what is not, everything is still a target, this formula just calculates the effort and skill and agent would theoretically need to successfully resolve a badfic. Its so much a limitation as a quantification of why agents are successful, as the dice are stacked in their favor.<br><br>I agree that there is a difference between deviation from canon and a badfic. But the deviance is the measure of the badfic to other badfics. The more twisted the and revolting the story is from other badfic, the more effort the author has put in to make it so (im not accounting for the author being randomly divergent as the end result is the same). So I don&#39;t see how the divergence from canon matters, when the measure is their hidiocity relative to other badfic, which puts emphasis on the most particularly horrible ones.<br><br>I will admit that it is neither particularly useful nor elegant, but I wrote it when I was sleep deprived. Now that Ive had some rest, Im looking through my thought process to see if I can refine it. At this point, you may are may not accept/like/want/need this, but I probabily wont be able to stop myself from thinking of it this way.<br><br>The though of a Department of Random and Useless Mathematics and Science popped into my head. With something along the lines of it being run by an artificial intelligence that has gone insane attempting to quantify badfic. It could be closely tied to R&amp;D and I laugh thinking about the exploits possible involving such a department. But I digress, I am new.<br><br>As for the multiverse, the way I see it, you have this large cable of story threads stretching on into infinity that is canon. Surrounding it are the writers of fanfic. The good fanfic are like needles inserted along the flow of the story threads and hardly make any kind of distortion. Badfic, however, is like a giant tumor shoved into the story thread. It stretches the lines out of shape, causing them to fray and even snap with enough pressure. They will continue to grow as the author feeds them,impacting more and more threads. The agents go in and destroy these abomination and then reconnect/smooth/fix the threads of canon. <br><br>This cable is holding up all goodfic and canon, and if enough badfic is ever inserted in one place in time at a time, the cable snaps, plunging the multiverse into a darkness of fiction, and the cable must be woven again. No one wants this to happen, so the PPC protects the Grand Story Thread of Canon. <br><br>p.s. The misspelling of canon was intentional. He referred to canon as CANNON because if you deviated from canon, he would fire the Canon Cannon and obliterate you.</p>

            <p>Are you just reading the originals or are you going through other agents missions as well.  I must confess.... I&#39;ve been off sick from work these past couple of days and have spent pretty much their entirity reading all the PPC missions I can lay my grubby little hands on.  There&#39;s some really good stuff out there.</p>

            <p>I was able to do something for March Madness after all! Oh frabjous day, and all that.<br><br>A few months ago I created a new pair of agents (Assassins this time), and I got around to writing an intro and a mission for them, but then, my internet access at home was compromised. I won&#39;t have full internet back until this summer, unless something miraculous happens.<br><br>Originally I considered having these new agents on the same website as my main ones, but I decided against it. <a href="http://rc273.webs.com"><a href="http://rc273.webs.com">http://rc273.webs.com</a></a> features Agents Kestrel and Mordecai, and their first mission as of yet. Another mission is currently in the works, and it will be a joint mission between Deuce and this pair, since Adder ended up in Medical after their last mission.<br><br>I might eventually come out with a third pair, but if I do, I&#39;ll stop there before I get too ahead of myself.</p>

            <p>... or two. You&#39;ll see what I mean.<br><br>1) The first one I wish to suggest is the &quot;Department of Unintentional Comedy&quot;. I think it would just be like the Department of Redundancy Department; it doesn&#39;t require field agents, the assassins and exorcists just phone in when they find a charge. The charges would be any cases of what TVTropes refers to as &quot;Narm&quot;; poorly-phrased lines or misspellings or whatever which ruin the dramatic mood and cause inappropriate laughter. Inspired by my finding what was supposed to be a dramatic rapefic in which the drama was utterly ruined by the RANDOM EMPHASIS! and UNNECESSARY EXCLAMATION POINTS! which left me unable to stop laughing at it.<br><br>2) The one which would require field agents is the &quot;Department of Babelfish&quot;. Far be it from me to make fun of non-native-English speakers who attempt to write in a language other than their own - if I was to try writing in French/Russian/Japanese/etc, I would sound far worse, though I&#39;d have the sense to get a competent native-speaker beta reader. But some fics are badfics regardless of what language they&#39;re in, and specially-trained agents might be required to make something resembling sense of badly-translated badfics. For an example, I point you at an author whose fic would still be a Mary Sue even if it was in coherent English: <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/u/1563512/RattytheScourge"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/u/1563512/RattytheScourge">http://www.fanfiction.net/u/1563512/RattytheScourge</a></a><br>Could be tricky to decide on which fics fall under this heading, though. We&#39;d have to sort of play it by ear.</p>

            <p>The type of fics that prompt this suggestion are annoying, because they are such an insult to the many folks who write ESL and do really well.  I know quite a few, and many of them have better grammar skills than I do as a native speaker.  Then there are the people that completely come across as ESL that are just really pathetic native speakers.  All of it seems to go back to the excuse list &quot;I&#39;m only 15 and I fail my English classes!&quot; (I saw this on the other day on the pit.) <br><br>It might make an interesting bit of trouble for the agents to try to decide if they should send a fic to the Babelfish folks, or just charge as a totally incompetent native speaker.  Maybe if it really seemed like the author had some chance of being brought to the goodfic side of things, it could be written sort of like the author correspondence stuff used to be.  Not that there would have to be any actual correspondence, just that the agents could claim there was.  If any of that babbling made sense.</p>

            <p>1) I think--not very experienced, so I don&#39;t know for certain--that unintentional comedy is probably a common trait of many or even most badfics that would still be another department&#39;s purview. I&#39;m not certain this needs to be its own department, although I&#39;m not especially opposed to the idea.<br><br>2) I like this, but I don&#39;t think it needs to be its own department either. My proposal would be to have the Department of WTF offer Interpreter courses to any interested agents, and when an especially incoherent badfic is assigned to a department it is passed on to the department&#39;s qualified Interpreters, or to another department if there are none available.</p>

            <p>The first one could be good for laughs, but I think it&#39;s one of those things that needn&#39;t officially exist until people actually use it as a joke in the course of actual mission-writing. There&#39;s LOTS of stuff it would be fun to have/do, but we don&#39;t want a Hogfather situation, with theoretical constructs popping into existence just because someone once suggested it somewhere. ... Well, okay, it kind of does actually work like that at times. But I&#39;d personally rather have it be something suggested in-universe than ex-universe. Probably because I want to see people writing missions. {= )<br><br>I don&#39;t really understand where you&#39;re going with the second one at all. The badfic is badfic no matter the language, and a poor translation is pretty easily spotted by anyone; so, badly-translated fics can be handled by anyone, and badfic in other languages can only be handled by people who speak it anyway. Not to mention that in-universe, the agents are all equipped with Universal Translators. So, what would such a department actually DO that isn&#39;t being done already?<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>The agents are wearing Universal Translators, but the UT only translates the characters speaking a canonical language that the agent doesn&#39;t know. It doesn&#39;t translate what the badfic writer meant from what they actually said, otherwise, say, &quot;legolas by laura&quot; would have been perfectly coherent to the agents. If the fic&#39;s written incoherently, it comes out looking incoherent despite the translator.</p>

            <p>I was also thinking; I kind of want to do something with the fic which inspired my idea of the Department of Unintentional Comedy, but it&#39;s Bad Slash in a fandom that my exorcist characters would A) not know and B) probably actively hate.

            <p>Or just use that as an excuse to combine your pairs of agents.  It&#39;s the Bad Slash agents mission with the Assassins long as fandom experts?  I&#39;m sure random agents have been paired up before in some stories.</p>

            <p>I like both ideas. <br><br>For 2) we need to play it by ear like you said. There needs to be a distinction between someone who is actually trying, and someone who is simply completely out of their depth. I&#39;d bet there&#39;s quite bit of people who try to learn English by way of their fandom, or maybe even *because* of their fandom. Learning a language can be a tender process and while publishing your work online exposes you automatically to all kinds of crazies like us, it&#39;s not cricket to make fun of them for trying to learn. <br><br>Could consider a department for foreign language fics if there isn&#39;t one yet. Though the traffic there might be low. </p>

            <p>Many a time I&#39;ve been reading a dramatic part of a fic, to find that bad spelling has caused outright hilarity! I&#39;m reminded of a Star Wars fic I read a few years ago, I forget its name. However, in a particularly tense part of the otherwise good plot, the lead character &#39;realised that the orgasms in the water were actually fish!&#39; (Should have been organisms, obviously...) I lold and the tension was ruined!</p>

            <p>Hi, Kallisti!<br><br>I&#39;m guessing you found us through the Wikia advertisement thing? Or elsewise? Please tell, we&#39;re curious. Welcome. <sup>_<sup><br><br>Okay,</sup></sup> number the one:<br><br>While the Constitution does say it can be signed, in reality it hasn&#39;t had any new signatures added to it for a few years now. Since P@L&#39;s site, the Oddlots one has gone down, and we&#39;ve rehosted the Constitution elsewhere, we can in theory add to it once more, but I&#39;m not the one in charge of it so one could possibly presume that either we&#39;re not editing it out of respect for the original signers who have pretty much nearly all disappeared, or that we&#39;re too lazy to get around to having it so that people can sign again.<br><br>Number the two:<br><br>That is a very excellent question!<br><br>We have an entire article on our wiki about <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Permission">permission</a> to write PPC missions there, as well as a <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/FAQ:_For_Newbies">guide to the PPC in general</a>, as well as a <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/FAQ:_For_Newbies">guide for newbies who are about to write their own spin off</a>. <br><br>The best way to go about becoming an assassin is to read as many spin offs as you can before you dive into writing. The most important things for anyone who&#39;s about to start their own missions or before they even get into the idea of writing a spin off is that we&#39;re about good writing and humor, first and foremost. You can say that this is educational (because it is!) since we&#39;re learning how to be good writers ourselves and what makes bad fanfiction bad (protip: What makes badfic bad is the same stuff that makes bad original fiction bad). It&#39;s not about just badfic and being disparaging about badfic and Mary Sues. <br><br>Once you&#39;ve been around for roughly a month (I personally encourage you to spend longer than a month to hang around and get to know everyone and read as much as you can; when I joined, I waited <b>three</b> months before I asked for permission) you just show a writing sample, your current vague idea for agents, and ask. People will comment on it, and at some point a Permission Giver will tell you you&#39;re good and ready to go if you are indeed good and ready to go. If you&#39;re not, you can always take some time to figure out where you went wrong and try again [if you don&#39;t annoy anyone too much. ;)].<br><br>Number the third:<br><br>As the person who founded/created the wiki in the first place, my personal opinion woudl be to read EVERYTHING ON THE WIKI <i><b><u>SECOND</u></b></i> to as much as you can from the <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/The_Complete_List_of_PPC_Fiction"> and the </a><a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/List_of_Everything_PPC">List of Everything PPC</a>. <br><br>That said, everything under the &quot;PPC Intro Pages&quot; Sidebar section would be a good place to start as well.<br><br>Again, you&#39;re very  welcome, we&#39;d like you to stay if you enjoy yourself (and we want you to enjoy yourself!) and if you can play along with our rules and the general quirky traditions that endure as a whole for the PPC community.<br><br>And if you ever have the time or inclination, you&#39;re welcome to join some of us on the <a href="http://widget.mibbit.com/?settings=12bf096bab4399ac3d0cc82c41d78b70&amp;server=irc.blitzed.org&amp;channel=%23PPC"> PPC Chatroom as well. </a> I promise we&#39;ll try and make sure Maslab doesn&#39;t cannibalise you.</p>

As an aspiring writer, cautious optimist about fanfic--I used to be violently opposed on the grounds that the only fanfics I&#39;d ever read or tried to read are apparently Legendarily bad, but the Book of Dreams, a published collection of Sandman fanfic stories, changed my mind by being very good--and lover of metafiction, it sounded right up my alley. <br><br>Besides, I get to help out other aspiring writers and kill Mary Sues. Or, even better, redeem them into legitimate characters.<br><br>I&#39;ve been reading over the Wiki, mostly just following various links, and the only burning question I have left is what guidelines exist for the Agent characters newbies write once they&#39;ve been around long enough to obtain Permission.</p>

            <p>The guidelines are very loose.<br><br>Some people write agents that are essentially themselves and people they know, others make up wholly new characters (original or fanfic), some use characters of theirs from works they&#39;re writing or are thinking up, and rarer is those who use doppelgangers of canons (near copies, you could say, but not quite.) The important thing is that your agent isn&#39;t a Sue or Stu and to make sure they don&#39;t become one themselves. Or are so crazily out there that they don&#39;t fit into the PPC or make sense enough as an Agent character for a spin off because they&#39;re so out there, if that makes sense.<br><br>Beyond that, not much I can think of.</p>

            <p>One wiki page mentioned a wish to avoid &quot;SuperPowered&quot; Agents because an Agent arms race is no fun for anyone and the point is to have fun, not vie for the dubious honor of having the most powerful Agent. I was mostly wondering what exactly it means by SuperPowered. Can my agent have any form of supernatural ability? Could he be a wizard/sorcerer/mage/magician/insert canon title for spellcaster here? Or does it simply mean to avoid agents so powerful they&#39;re a Sue or Stu? It said to dream up two agents, and one I was planning to use was an original character of mine, who I wrote a story about and played in a sadly short-lived D&amp;D campaign. But he&#39;s a spellcaster, although not an especially potent one. Does this disqualify him?</p>

            <p>What we mean by &quot;superpowered&quot; is basically anything that allows the agent to get through a mission without difficulty. The difficulty--the horror of the bad writing, or the danger of taking down a powerful Sue, or the agent&#39;s own brand of incompetence, or whatever combination--is what makes missions fun to read, see, so if you were to write a mage who was always cool and collected and went around stopping time and casting instant death spells on every Sue, it would be boring. On the other hand, a low-level wizard who suffers from the appropriate arcane spell failure chance can have just as much trouble as anyone else, and so can be fun to read about.

            <p>The main difficulties for this character would be his lack of any real battle experience--he acts like he&#39;s such a hardened veteran, but he&#39;s only ever been in one honest-to-Eris battle, although he&#39;s been in brawls on occasion--and the fact that he&#39;s familiar with neither badfic nor any of the other continuums besides his native one, and therefore in for quite a bit of surprise and horror. Combat-wise he&#39;s a competent fighter and a decent mage, but nothing terribly special on either count. Definitely not good enough to take down a powerful Sue without help or very good Sufficiently Advanced Technology and quite a bit of luck.<br><br>Thank you.</p>

            <p>As the title suggests, I have finished a short story for the March Madness contest (my &quot;Madness&quot; is signing up for the PPC in the first place). This is set in my own world, hopefully explored further soon, and imagines what the effect of magic would be on crime. I hope that it is well-written, and that you guys like it! I have uploaded the story <a href="http://www.fictionpress.com/s/2788074/1/A_Shadow_on_Padded_Feet">here</a>. Yes, I know that it is on FictionPress, and that that site is very similar to the Pit. Please don&#39;t complain. Neshomeh, if it&#39;s all right, I would like the beta reading. Don&#39;t stretch yourself too thin, though! And just for clarification, entering it here will not prevent me from using my story for my permission request, right?</p>

            <p>I&#39;m really glad that you enjoyed it! I hope that the somewhat nebulous descriptions aren&#39;t a problem for anyone. I find that I like to be able to create my own mental pictures  more than trying to match them to someone else&#39;s. Besides, if I try to describe much more than the minimum required for the storyline, I wind up spending a Mary Sue-length paragraph on the landscapes. Practically everything is better than that.</p>

            <p>well, the prime limitation would be waiting at least one month for permission from one of the permission givers.  Which gives you loads of time to look up all the missions you can for a little more learning on the whole PPC concept.  Believe me you can have loads of fun reading up.

            <p>Yeah, Another question thread... Anyways.<br><br>I&#39;ve been thinking about writing something still PPC related, but something that hasn&#39;t been looked into very much (After I get permission, of course!) That&#39;s why all these questions revolve around a particular theme.<br><br>1. How are the &#39;sues made inside the pods, exactly? Is the physical body created first, then are they sueified? (I assume this is correct as it would also allow them to capture people and turn them into sues, as making people from the ground up, sues or not, would be pretty resource intensive.)<br><br>2. I&#39;ve always assumed the factory sues are controlled by something or brainwashed into servitude instead of just following the words like normal sues do. (This would also make sense, as from what I&#39;m getting from what mentions them, they seem pretty... mindless and drone-like.) Is this assumption reasonable?<br><br>3. How common are Defectives made, and do they vary in &quot;completeness&quot;? (For example, one could have some color and might have been subjected to some brainwashing, while another one could be entirely uncolored and only be working out of fear, as opposed to their brain being programmed to do it)<br><br>4. An offshoot of question one, what would happen if something disturbs the process that makes or sueifies whoever&#39;s inside? (Like some rowdy agents who thought vandalizing the place might be fun, or a workplace accident.) What happens if the pod breaks entirely during this, leaving the &#39;sue incomplete?<br><br>5. Are the pods automated, or are there control panels that someone could modify whoever&#39;s inside with? Maybe a combination of the two?<br><br>6. How defended are the factories, anyway? How easy would it be for one to get in/out of one? (Assuming that they have at least SOME kind of security... I&#39;m betting automated turrets of some kind.)<br><br>7. If the PPC were to obtain some of the technology used inside the factories, what would they reverse-engineer it to do?<br><br>8. There&#39;s a reason this is the last question.<br><br>Let&#39;s say the factories learn of World One. The sues, obviously much more powerful and combat-worthy than us puny humans, decide to launch a small invasion force on World One. Somehow, word of this leaks to the PPC. How would they react?<br><br>That&#39;s all for now.</p>

            <p>1/ Not explained. I seem to recall Vemi and myself thinking of the fluid in the pods as a superenergetic liquid (which is an absurdity of physics; basically imagine they crammed as much energy as possible in without the pods bursting), but the process is thoroughly undefined. I&#39;d say that &#39;Suifying someone would be a) impossible and b) pointless. Impossible because superenergetic fluid is likely deadly, and pointless because they&#39;ve perfected cloning. &quot;Resource-intensive&quot; is fairly unimportant for anyone with plothole access. Also bear in mind that these aren&#39;t humans/etc we&#39;re talking about -- Mary-Sues have glitter for blood.<br><br>2/ In our minds, the Mary-Sue Factory was one of the primary sources of &#39;Sues. In my particular mind, a Mary-Sue is simply a walking nexus of plotholes. Intentionally or not, they manipulate the world around them in profoundly unnatural ways. The Factory must have worked out how to create nexuses (This is all being invented on the fly, here). However, &#39;brainwashed into servitude&#39; is right out. These are clones and created beings. You don&#39;t brainwash them -- you create their minds from scratch (or templates). They <i>can</i> be controlled directly (the Mysterious Somebody did that) but they&#39;re not usually an army. It&#39;s best to make them annoying and just turn them loose.<br><br>3/ Defectives are what the name suggests -- defective. They&#39;re the result of the construction process going wrong at some point. The reason they&#39;re usually colourless is that a failure at an earlier stage is usually fatal. They&#39;re probably slightly less annoying than normal Sues, if only because they&#39;re staff -- they need to be people the Flowers can work with, rather than just be irritated by.<br><br>4/ The answer to this is the answer to question 3: either a Defective or a dead &#39;Sue and a quick recycle. In The Reorganisation, the entire original Factory was set to recycle, resulting in every single &#39;Sue under construction being dissolved. Also, as someone mentioned, if an Agent found a Factory, she&#39;d either be killed or report it to Upstairs, who&#39;d attack in force. Mary-Sue Factories are very bad things.<br><br>5/ Probably a combination. They don&#39;t need constant supervision, but at least the initial setup is external. They can also be set to recycle at any point. I guess they could probably change anything which isn&#39;t initialised yet.<br><br>6/ The Factories are essentially miniature versions of HQ. They have Defectives instead of Agents, but there are still Flowers in each one. They aren&#39;t robotic places pumping out &#39;Sues, unless someone wrote something I&#39;ve not read. They&#39;re also covered by Someone Else&#39;s Problem fields (or at least the original was).<br><br>7/ Nothing. DoSAT could do everything the Factories do if they wanted to, but why bother? Cloning, personality-creation, mixing genetics... they&#39;re all canon technologies. Remember the original Factory was actually <i>set up</i> by members of the PPC.<br><br>8. Again, &#39;learn of&#39; is impossible. Every sentient Flower was a former member of the PPC (since the only way they can be created is through a portal set up in HQ), so they already <i>know</i> about World One. It&#39;s one world in an infinite Multiverse -- there&#39;s nothing particularly worth invading there. Also, to be honest, &#39;Sues do <i>not</i> work well together. The DTE once let a pair of them kill each other over which was the most beautiful. There have been two armies of &#39;Sues that I know of -- one under heavy mind-control (during Crashing Down), and one unleashed during the 2008 invasion. That one didn&#39;t work as an army, but as a collection of overpowered individuals bent on wreaking havoc.<br><br>Also bear in mind that the Flowers of the Factories are doing all this for pretty much two purposes: to afflict the PPC and to gain power/money/etc. The PPC is far better assailed in the way they&#39;re currently doing it (eg, Fanfiction.net), and there&#39;s not much to be gained from outright invasion.<br><br>As to whether individual &#39;Sues could make a living for themselves in World One -- some would say they already have. :P<br><br>hS<br><br>PS: Remember that all of the above is only my opinion. I created one Factory; someone else invented the League. The PPC is community property. ~hS</p>

            <p>1) I have absolutely no idea, and I believe the answer depends entirely on the author-- hS, I think?<br><br>2) Again, what a &quot;normal&quot; Sue is, and what these Sues do, and what the difference is, and if these Sues are following the Words that we can&#39;t see... up to their authors, I believe. Personally, I&#39;d long ago begun a story where &#39;Sues were born/made, in an OFU-style academy. It was a backstory, not an Event, though...<br><br>3) No idea. Perhaps if I knew what Defectives were...<br><br>4) I thought that&#39;d already been a plot of a story somehow? (Also, wouldn&#39;t agents who knew about it, rather than rowdy vandalism, be into a full-on attack?)<br><br>5) Again, the author and creator of those pods knows... whoever that is. (I&#39;m almost certain it&#39;s hS.) If you&#39;d Permission <i>not only</i> to write Missions, but to use this idea, you&#39;d probably have to ask him.<br><br>6 - 8 <br>We write this canon, Max. Asking stuff like this... how can I put it? It&#39;s like if you&#39;re trying to develop an awesome game in a universe you&#39;re helping a handful of people make up, and it&#39;s a few years into development, and you keep asking &quot;But what if this character does this? Does this griffin the character rides need food, or does it just graze?&quot; The answer is generally &quot;Look at the guidelines, and then-- what do -you- think?&quot; If you get Permission, a decent beta, and approval, use your own discretion.<br><br>That said... It looks like what you&#39;re planning is a big-huge-cataclysmic-style Event. I&#39;m fairly sure we&#39;ve got a ban on those at the moment, in favor of just writing straight-up Missions, because the PPC was becoming some kind of Apocalypto-world. So... yeah. Once you&#39;ve got Permission, you still need to ask the &#39;Board to do something like a Sue invasion of World One or what have you. It&#39;s... like I said. It&#39;s like trying to develop a world, with all these little stories, so most often when you&#39;ve got little specific questions like &quot;How does this work?&quot; you can just think a bit and ask someone with a little experience to beta your ideas. But when you&#39;ve got some huge, gigantic, world-shaking idea that&#39;s going to involve everyone, will they or no, you&#39;ve got to -ask-.<br><br>Hope at least some of this was helpful. &gt;_&gt;</p>

            <p>A recent post on Deleterius linked back to this post from 2003:<br><a href="http://community.livejournal.com/marysues/238367.html"><a href="http://community.livejournal.com/marysues/238367.html">http://community.livejournal.com/marysues/238367.html</a></a><br><br>In it, the sporker provides a link to the ffnet profile of the dreaded &quot;laura&quot; of &quot;legolas&quot; fame.

            <p>Special needs does accord one some extra patience, I&#39;d agree. However, the facts in this case don&#39;t argue for much sympathy.<br><br>1. She&#39;s been at it a long time, apparently--at least three years. Even if we can&#39;t expect her to know the rules of spelling and grammar by heart, we CAN expect her to have realized that spell-check is a good thing.<br><br>2. The fact that she points out being special needs as an excuse for bad spelling and grammar suggests that she KNOWS it&#39;s bad and has done nothing to improve. That&#39;s just laziness in anyone; see also first point.<br><br>3. Furthermore, I&#39;d conjecture that feeling the need to give excuses suggests that she is aware of negative response she&#39;s getting and why she&#39;s getting it, and (again) has done nothing to improve the issues. Again, we have a lack of willingness or even outright refusal to improve, even though the fix is so very simple and it seems clear that she&#39;s at least smart enough to know what it is.<br><br>Given all of the above and the fact that she still puts her stuff out for the world to see, I think the world is entitled to its continued negative response. If it were anything but writing, I would say differently, but it is SO EASY to clean up a piece of writing, at least mechanically, that I find it very hard to sympathize with people who don&#39;t even bother with a simple spell-check, whether they&#39;re eleven, or special needs, or whatever.<br><br>... Of course, I also think that over-reliance on spell-check probably means that people don&#39;t learn to spell properly for themselves. But that&#39;s a whole other issue.<br><br>~Neshomeh, possibly controversial.</p>

            <p>That was a <i>bad</i> fic. I don&#39;t know how you two survived PPCing it. I would have run away screaming and burning things, or I would have ended up laughing madly for hours. That prophesy was utterly ridiculous. (Why do Suethors have to have a prophesy for everything the characters majorly do?) I had to stifle my laughter for about five minutes straight in order to get myself under control. Overall, it was a very funny and enjoyable mission. You did a good job, you two. <br><br><i>Spoilers for <u>Squire</u> ahead!</i><br><br>I only have one nitpick (because I&#39;m currently rereading <u>Squire</u> at the moment) and that is that Kel <i>did</i> meet Alanna before she was knighted. Kel saw Alanna for the first time during that scene in <u>Squire</u> with the Yamani women playing with the red fan (when Neal almost cut his fingers off by barging into the game). She met Alanna for the first time when Alanna was dinner partners with Raoul at that certain banquet where Kel dropped the finger bowl and spilled water all over Alanna and Raoul&#39;s clothing. Kel and Alanna spoke of some things concerning Kel&#39;s training and her griffin. So Alanna met Kel outside of public functions once Kel was knighted, yes, but Kel did speak to Alanna as a squire.</p>

            <p>What I can get of it is beyond entertaining, and quickly wearing a track into my brain.

            <p>Actually there is a lot of really good stuff in the 80&#39;s Cartoons bits. Including a textbook example (to my mind) of how to write OCs so they are believable. <br><br>Unfortunatly the GI-Joe and TF movies have bought with them a large selection of Fanthings.

            <p>Dear All At PPC, <br>My name (obviously) is Ruin Takada, and I would like to become a member on this great site. I have been a fanfic author for over two years, and I have seen some pretty horrible things on there in my time. Rather than disconnect myself from the site on which I reside most of the time, I wish to do something about it, and clear up the filth that is Sue-ness! I am ready to join, and will do so as either a Boarder or an Agent, I&#39;m not too picky (although preferably as an Agent). Thank you for reading this, and please reply soon.   </p>

            <p>Yeah, you can call me Ruin: I usually ask people to do that anyways. Thanks for the harness, it&#39;ll be really useful... anyways, since it&#39;s &#39;brain-sized&#39;, does that mean the size is relative depending on the user??? (&gt;O<br>For my work, just go onto fanfiction.net, and do an Author search on my penname (incidently, it&#39;s the same one as the one here). So far, I have done stories for DN Angel, which haven&#39;t been completed as I accumulated more brain-cells and dropped them, a few on Death Note (yes, THAT controvesial anime/manga piece), and one on HollyOaks, the British soap. The best one to read as an example is &#39;The Art of Subconscious Illusion: Rewritten&#39;. It isn&#39;t finshed, but it&#39;s better than the original, and I feel that this will shape up to be my best when it&#39;s done. </p>

            <p>As I sit here, in my parents&#39; living room on my spring <s>exile</s> break, waiting for my tea to steep, I am thinking: Exactly how can i tell my mother that, after 21 years of knowing me, and 15 years of being repeatedly told how I take my tea, she <i>still</i> makes it wrong? And not just wrong... Rather horribly. For example, the Chai that I have steeping. <br><br>She made it with a single tea bag, about three tablespoons of milk, and about a teaspoon of sugar and a teaspoon of stevia. <br><br>... I cannot even begin to say what is wrong with this. Weak, watery, under-sweet, funny-aftertaste stuff. <br><br>For myself, I use two bags, plenty of milk (or better, cream) very hot water, and lots of sugar. Or better, honey! <br><br>Anyway, getting to the point: What way to you prefer your favorite cup of tea? Or, for those who don&#39;t drink tea, how do you prefer your tea-substitute? </p>

            <p>Or, for that matter, Coffee. I don&#39;t like the taste of it, even though the smell of Coffee is pretty good. I had really good Chai tea once at a tea shop, but it was loaded with cream, sugar, and other cavity-inducing gunk, so I couldn&#39;t really tell what the Chai actually tasted like. Then I had this pear-lemon-honey tea when I had a cold and it was absolutely nasty, even though my parents suggested it to me and said it was good. (Now that I think of it, I&#39;ve probably got only myself to blame for that nauseating experience because I didn&#39;t add any cream or sugar to the tea and drank it straight from the cup. Yuck.) Instead of coffee and tea, I drink hot cocoa. I can&#39;t get enough of that drink. Chocolaty and creamy hot cocoa with a handful of marshmallows thrown in and I&#39;m completely happy. </p>

            <p>Either Panyang Congu, mint tea, or Earl Grey (and a couple of times I had something called Paris which was really sweet and sort of exotic and I loved it, but the box was almost empty and ran out really fast). Either I throw a couple spoonfuls in a strainer or toss in a teabag, stew for three minutes, and throw in an ungodly amount of sugar and some milk. Way more milk in the mornings so it becomes cool enough to drink in time for me to actually drink it. (Incidentally, I make it by the moderate-size mug, not the pot, so it comes out pretty strong.)<br><br>Random depressing sidenote - Earl Grey tea reminds me of my deceased grandmother more than anything else on Earth. The odd part being I never had a clue she made Earl Grey at the family teas until I took a sip of it as a teenager and recognized the flavor. I guess taste really is an evocative sense.</p>

            <p>Ouch. I feel your pain. Personally, I like a weak tea (two bags), left to steep for about thirty minutes in extriemly hot water (to make it strong), plenty of sugar (though honey is preferable), and then enjoyed at a leisurely pace (usually with a good book or peridocial). </p>

However, there are a few things I do consistently:<br><br>Chai must be strong, sweet enough to heighten the flavors, and milky, generally about 3/4 water to 1/4 whole milk. A barely-rounded teaspoon of sugar goes in with the teabag (only one, so as to conserve), then water; steep about five minutes, then add milk.<br><br>I will drink green tea straight if plain, but if it is flavored, it must have honey--generally about half a teaspoon. Plain sugar just doesn&#39;t work as well with green tea.<br><br>Earl Grey is my favorite black tea. There is no wrong way to drink Earl Grey as long as it&#39;s strong and you can smell the bergamot in the next room.<br><br>I prefer the simpler blends of chai, with a few potent, well-balanced ingredients, and no anise. I believe the essentials are cinnamon, cardamom, ginger, clove, and possibly allspice. <br><br>My mug is about 10 oz, I think, and it DOES get washed due to the variety of things that get put in it.<br><br>The only thing I really don&#39;t like is Rooibos. I keep trying it, but I keep coming away disappointed.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I generally like a lot of teas (except those of certain brands- I&#39;m looking at you, Lipton). For some reason, I can&#39;t really stand anything in my tea, especially sugar. The more bitter, the better. :D I&#39;ve also taken a liking to herbal teas...</p>

            <p>Bad chai is often worse than no chai at all.<br><br>Chai&#39;s definitely my favorite-- nice and strong (sometimes if I had to buy the weak stuff, I&#39;ll throw in a black tea bag, which kind of gives it at least a little strength), with just a little bit of honey, and just enough milk/soy-milk/almond milk (if I am being fiscally irresponsible and currently valuing tea over food, which happens more often than it should) to make it caramel-coloured.<br><br>Green tea is good, too, with lemon especially, and black tea if we&#39;ve got any milkstuffs. I can&#39;t drink that stuff black, even with an ungodly amount of sugar. Guh. When there&#39;s no milkstuffs around, herbal teas are good-- ginger especially (made my first mug of fresh ginger tea the other day, absolutely amazing), or mint. Tazo makes three different mint teas that I can think of, all quite good if you can find them marked down.<br><br>As for tea substitute? I used to steer clear of coffee &#39;cos of the whole fair-trade thing (as in, affordable coffee is morally objectionable, and good coffee is too expensive), but since I got a job at a little soup restaurant and am allowed one meal per five hour shift, I allow myself a Starbucks mocha before work (they&#39;re just across the plaza). It&#39;s quite good!<br><br>...Mmmm, tea. Think I&#39;ll go make some. &gt;_&gt;</p>

            <p>After over twenty years of asking my parents still don&#39;t seem to remember that I don&#39;t drink coffee. They claim they ask on the off-chance that I have begun drinking coffee since they last saw me. Which is fair enough, but then why ask me on Saterday after know whether I drink coffee and again in the evening of that same day?<br><br>I&#39;m a tea drinker. Meanwhile green tea with a touch of lemon these days. Used to drink lots of Earl grey. Washed my mug about once a three month period. Usually shortly after someone asked me why I put a tea bag in my coffee.</p>

            <p>Strong, black, normal tea. We&#39;re on PG Tips at the moment, cos there was no Tetley&#39;s on cheap.<br><br>Pint-and-a-half mug. (Which never gets washed, because the limescale scum and the crust adds flavour.)<br><br>Teabag first, then water. Leave to stew for at least the duration of a fag. (Roll, not straight. Ie at least seven minutes.)<br><br>A decent splash of milk, so it&#39;s the colour of a rich tea biscuit (NOT a digestive).<br><br>No sugar.<br><br>And since I&#39;m lazy and the kettle&#39;s downstairs and it takes twenty minutes to brew in a cup that size, we just throw in teabag, hot water, stir, milk, and leave the bag in. By the time it&#39;s cool enough to drink (ie in fifteen minutes) it&#39;s brewed properly.</p>

            <p>I do enjoy my chai.  I take it as strong and spicy as possible.  Also, fairly sweet and with enough milk to turn it a pleasant caramel color.<br><br>I also like fruit teas.  I take those with nothing but sugar, and plenty of that.<br><br>I have a tendency to experiment with mixing different teas together.  Fruit and chai actually works rather well in a couple of circumstances.</p>

            <p>Personally I go for a nice cup of Earl Grey or Darjeeling, depending upon what sort of mood I&#39;m in.  Brew for five minutes, with a splash of milk.  Sounds just about perfect to me.</p>
