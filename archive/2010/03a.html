            <p>First, I believe a heap of thanks are in order. I am enthralled with all of these wonderful gifts, however, I have no idea of either their purpose or their meaning. <br><br>Moving on, I am a fan of the following:<br>Battlestar Galactica (NEW, the origional is great for the day, however it cannot compare with CGI)<br>Star Wars (ANYTHING) <br>Percy Jackson and the Olympians (Current project)<br>Ender&#39;s Game <br>Harry Potter<br><br>I have read the constutition, and I will follow all Da Rules. <br><br>Whats more, I was able to find you with many thanks to the wiki. It was featured on the sidebar of the Percy Jackson and the Olympians Fanfiction site; which is where my current project resides if you so choose to read it.<br>My screen name is the same. <br><br>Again, many thanks. Cheers to improvement, whatever the cost.</p>

            <p>A lot of us have a gift that we give to everyone. Some will be useful for future agents, some (like mine) are just random. (It&#39;s also a literary reference, but that&#39;s beside the point.)<br><br>I read the last book of the Olympians series. I probably should have started with book 1, but the last was the book that was lying around. It wasn&#39;t bad. Percy seems relatively likeable, which is unusual. -grins-<br><br>--anamia</p>

            <p>The story I&#39;m working on is not mainstream. It&#39;s more a side-story. Completely different characters, same story line, different view. Nothing that would play havoc on the Canon. Like I said, that just pisses me off.</p>

            <p>Those are always fun to work on. I&#39;ll admit, I tend to twist canon characters into doing what I want them to do (though I do my very best to do it gradually, so that it&#39;s believable), but side-characters are also great fun. I work mainly within the Harry Potter continuum, meaning there are lots and lots of fun characters to torture... er, I mean write about.<br><br>As soon as I get home from school, I&#39;ll go looking for your story.<br><br>--anamia</p>

            <p>Welcome to the PPC! Here&#39;s an archery set from the Raven Armory and a bottle of bleeprin. (If you don&#39;t know, bleeprin is a medication made of bleach and asprin in the form of a white pill that is used to get rid of the scarring memories of bad fanfiction.)

            <p>I was wondering, are there any worlds that get written off? I mean, if a canon Sue exists, what do we do about it?<br>Were those worlds originally innocent, that became possessed by a Sue that is so powerful it perverted reality sufficiently to make it unrecoverable? Or are they simply an ignored part of the fandom. If so, something needs to be done.<br>For instance, take Terry Goodkind. While he is a gifted author, his characters a blatant power fantasy&#39;s and Sues, and are used to shunt his personal political views down our throat, and women are simply there to be abused and raped. And of course, Satan logic.<br>If you don&#39;t agree with me, well each to their own, I will admit I can understand why those less cynical and embittered, or less idealistic may enjoy them, but I see them this way.<br>As such, Richard could be seen as a Sue, quite easily. Now Goodkind has forbidden fanfiction, so is that because Sues respect him enough to keep of his turf/fear him?<br>And does our organization leave him alone because we know any attempt to remove him will simply make things worse?<br>A less controversial example is probably Twilight. While many consider it a mainstream guilty (or not so guilty pleasure). Nothing wrong with that. Many people enjoy Sue stories too. Some of us are probably guilty.<br>So what is the organizations view on that?<br>Or Eragon. Blatant Sue, most characters only exist to praise him, he can do anything, and the evil empire only exists because Eragon needs something to oppose.<br>He learns to read, fluently, in a week. He becomes a master swordsman in two months. And so on.<br>This is an honest question. I do not judge you for liking them. Hell, I&#39;ve written for the Eragon fandom, because despite ripping off Tolkien and other authors, he does have potential.</p>

            <p>I don&#39;t know, but I agree with you on Terry Goodkind. stories shouldn&#39;t be made to shunt personal polital views down people&#39;s throats. Take for example, the manga/anime series Death Note. Although it is generally about the rights and wrongs of different sorts of methods of carrying out Justice (e.g. the end-all answer of Catipal punishment), it works in that the different views are presented to you, and you pick your own team - it was mainly made for entertainment, not for discussion. <br><br>However, that manga has very few female main characters, and out of the three there were, one was manipulated and kept in ignorance of the protagonist&#39;s true feelings, while at the same time being treated like a stupid little girl; another was kidnapped and ended up with PTS disorder; and the third was manipulated sexually, kidnapped, THEN burned alive after being stripped of her clothes. Most likely all things that Terry Goodkind has already done, or will do in future.<br><br>Hmm...as for Eragon, I&#39;ll admit that I like that series alot, and that I enjoy the stories, I do believe you&#39;re right about the Gary Stu-ness. But it&#39;ll take more than two assassins to take him down, since he has a dragon. </p>

            <p>If it&#39;s bad OriginalFic, OriginalAuthorFic, or licensed CanonFic, that is the Plot Continuum that we&#39;re supposed to protect.  If there&#39;s some fanbrat manages to make something that screams Sue even within the configuration of the <i>Sword of Truth</i> series, it&#39;s possible some PPC Agent is assigned the thing, assuming there&#39;s an Agent that&#39;s familiar with the setting and can be trusted to not kill every canon in a hundred miles.<br><br>There&#39;s no particular surfeit of Agents chronicled on these boards interested in signing up for such fics, and it would be hard to make them funny, though.  You won&#39;t see them PPCed too often -- but there are <a href="http://sedri.livejournal.com/28117.html">some still</a> in worse fandoms.<br><br>Some canons are just left alone.  To borrow from <a href="http://www.freewebs.com/ppc_manual/Volume01.htm">the Manual</a> : <blockquote>&quot;...<i>in some cases there wasn&#39;t enough of a coherent &#39;canon&#39; to allow a charge list to be composed. This problem has only been exaggerated by the trend in comic-book movies, and Intelligence has, in general, thrown up its hands and given fanwriters free reign. Some few dedicated Agents continue to monitor the continua to this day, searching for signs of coherency, but they are widely regarded as insane.</i>&quot;</blockquote>  Presumably some writing is at this point, as well; it may be impossible to tell where the <i>non-canon</i> Sue is in whirlwinds of glitter, all the stable natural plotholes make the unstable ones near-impossible to figure out, or assembling a charge list is impossible.  If the continuum can&#39;t be saved, the PPC is just too busy, underfunded, and inexperienced to try and waste Agents on such a matter.<br><br>There&#39;s some more in-depth discussions on this matter at the <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Mission_Writing_Guide#What_about_adaptations.2C_or_expanded_or_alternate_works_someone_other_than_the_author_made.3F_They.E2.80.99re_not_.E2.80.9Coriginal.E2.80.9D_published_works.">Mission Writing Guide</a> on what can and can&#39;t be PPCed.<br><br>As for settings where the author has forbidden fanfiction, while there are still Mary Sues trying to bend the universe, it&#39;s probably best to leave them alone.  We&#39;d still be trespassing on the Author&#39;s territory, after all.  That opens up a lot of opportunity for take-down notices or cease-and-desists on World One, and results ranging from lightning bolts from the sky to sudden quantum existence failure to the Words making every canon character think you&#39;re a threat.  The Authors are the creators of these worlds, and while their power is not unlimited, Agents can not defy it without becoming the very things they hunt.<br><br><i>All that said</i>, being humorous is a big part -- the big part -- of the PPC, too.  If there&#39;s an incredibly obvious fanwriter&#39;s Sue in a fandom you love to hate, go for it and don&#39;t hesitate to make fun of the canonSues while you&#39;re there.  You can&#39;t break what they do in canon, but that still leaves a lot of opportunity for humor.</p>

            <p>All <u>that</u> said, there are other things that can... occur... to bad continuums.  Cleolinda has a great list of the problems and oddities <a href="http://cleolinda.livejournal.com/630150.html">in <i>Twilight</i></a>.  The <a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/169/the_sword_of_good/">Sword Of Good</a> is a short-story that completely sporks the various concepts common to works like <i>Sword Of Truth</i>, although it&#39;s more meant as a stand-alone.  Kippurbird, the writer for Agents Alec Troven and Verra has a <a href="http://eragon-sporkings.wikispaces.com/">long, long</a> sporking off all the things in <i>Eragon</i> that she couldn&#39;t stand.    There&#39;s nothing preventing you from using an established format or tone to shamelessly poke fun at a horrible original fiction work; it&#39;s just not the PPC&#39;s focus.</p>

            <p>If I am to do any missions in the one piece universe, I will have to spend the majority of the mission aboard the going merry/thousand sunny. Both are small/medium sized pirate ships with a crew of 9 at the most.  The rooms will be small and yet I will have to find away to hide from view of OCs while still being able to spy on them while wirting charges <br>(I found a fic where the sue had a rather awkward bath with zoro and don&#39;t know how you would tackle that one) The Straw Hat pirates rarely have any strangers aboard their ship so simply disguising myself wouldn&#39;t work, and I would probably be attacked by the entire crew if I was detected.

            <p>The Merry Go? Well, you could presumably camp out in Chopper&#39;s cabin- he&#39;s a canon, he&#39;s small, and Sues don&#39;t usually attack him. From there you can pull a &#39;invisible handmaiden&#39; thing, like in TOS.</p>

            <p>Alternatively, you could always just approach Luffy and ask to join the crew. He&#39;ll most likely say yes unless he&#39;s so far gone that he might as well be an OC, and if any OCs catch you, then Luffy can vouch for you being a crew member.<br><br>This, of course, depends on the crew actually landing somewhere.

            <p>In plain sight. Cargo bay is a risky possibility, but the fact remains you have to find a way to feed yourself and find water. If your in the ocean, chances are people will notice if it goes missing, and there will be a search.<br>If they are coast hugging, it will be rather easier, but on a small ship you will likely have trouble. As they are pirates, there is likely a hidey hole beneath the floorboards or in a similar hard to discover area where they keep valuable cargo, but it depends how often they check on it, and the aforementioned issue of supplying yourself.<br>All in all, I would recommend your best chance is some sort of disguise. If you can&#39;t make them open up to you, pretend to be someone they can&#39;t dislodge, either out of fear or respect.<br> - It is a tough question.</p>

            <p>Yes, bringing one&#39;s own supplies is a good idea.<br><br>However, precedent in TOS says that agents aren&#39;t supposed to leave the fi...il the mission is done, so unless the situation were particularly dire, portalling to HQ in the middle of the mission would be out.

            <p>I dunno. But really there shouldn&#39;t be much of a problem as long as nobody actually runs into the agents and they&#39;re not being excessively loud, due to the cloaking effect of the SEP field and the canon being helpful.<br><br>I like the small disguises idea, though. If ridiculously large disguises can be done (e.g. dragons), then there&#39;s no reason ridiculously small ones (rats?) can&#39;t.

            <p>I comes bearing links. *drags out Big Bag O&#39; Links and digs through it*<br><br>First off is the link to the <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/PPC_Wiki">Wiki</a>, a veritable fount of information for a newbie to read through. Especially helpful for you if you want to write missions would be the page on <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Permission">Permission</a> (note the capital P).<br><br>I would advise against reading any <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Legendary_badfic">Legendary Badfic</a>, unless you are of strong mind and stomach. Even the summaries have been known to give those of weaker constitution nightmares.<br><br>For your reading pleasure, not knowing what you have already managed to find, I have several links for you. <a href="http://www.misssandman.com/PPC/story.html">The Original Series</a> (not to be confused with Star Trek) is a good place to start, as the PPC did many aeons ago. <s>What do you mean I&#39;m exaggerating?</s> <a href="http://www.freewebs.com/bonsaimallorn/">The Department of Geographical Aberrations</a> is another interesting place to visit, if you have the time and inclination. Also by hS is the <a href="http://www.freewebs.com/ppchistory/index.htm">Tangled Webs</a> site, which contains backstory for the PPC as an organisation. If you would rather visit the Floaters, then <a href="http://julyppc.webs.com/">July&#39;s site</a> is the place you need to be. And last, but most definitely not least, <a href="http://rc45.dreamwidth.org/">Response Centre 45</a> is where Trojie and Pads&#39; missions are archived.<br><br>Hope you enjoy your stay here. Please deposit your sanity into the container offered to you by another Boarder; you won&#39;t be needing it here. </p>

            <p>*pokes*<br><br>And no more rhymes now, I mean it. {; p<br><br>Let&#39;s see... it doesn&#39;t look like you&#39;ve been hit with a Bag o&#39; Links yet, so I&#39;ll give you some. First, if you have not done so, you should read the <a href="http://twistedskein.webs.com/PPCHome/Constitution.htm">PPC Board Constitution</a>, which we expect everyone to abide by when interacting with the community. After that, you should also read the Wiki article about <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Permission">Permission</a> if you want to write PPC stories. Other helpful writings can be found by looking through the PPC Intro Pages tab on aforementioned Wiki. Finally, you should absolutely take the time to read the <a href="http://www.misssandman.com/PPC/story.html">Original Series</a> (not to be confused with Star Trek), since it is essentially our canon material and sets the tone for what we do and how we do it.<br><br>So much for required reading. I personally recommend the contents of the <a href="http://plotprotectors.tripod.com/">PPC Lost Tales</a> archive, since it is the only place to see some of the things written contemporarily with the OS since GeoCities fell through the Veil. (I also maintain the site, so please let me know if you spot any errors or want to help out!) I also recommend the <a href="http://www.misssandman.com/LOTR/ofum.html">Official Fanfiction University of Middle-earth</a> and, since you&#39;re a Potter fan, the <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/985773/1/">Hogwarts Fanfiction Academy</a>. The OFUs are separate from the PPC, but there is a long history of friendship between them and us, and therefore many in-jokes traded back and forth.<br><br>I also notice that you are an artist. Are you on deviantART, by any chance? You&#39;ll find me at <a href="http://neshomeh.deviantart.com"><a href="http://neshomeh.deviantart.com">http://neshomeh.deviantart.com</a></a>, if you&#39;re interested.<br><br>On a semi-related note, making multiple threads in a row is discouraged, since it pushes old threads off the bottom of the page, making them more difficult to access. If there is already a thread where your new post would fit (in this case, this one), we&#39;d prefer you put it there. {= )<br><br>But that&#39;s enough for now. I&#39;m neglecting my own writing challenge (see down-page), so I shall be getting back to that.<br><br>Welcome!<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>So, uh, hi. I found the PPC through TvTropes, did some research via the PPC wiki, and as you may have gathered, got really, really lost. So... everyone said the Boarders were welcoming, so I figured I&#39;d show up, ask for help, and cross my fingers against screwing up, ruining a topic, or anything else. I&#39;ve finished what&#39;s available of The Original Series, and I&#39;m kind of wondering what I should read next, and where to find it, and how best to navigate the ever-growing PPC, and... all of that.<br><br>Oh, and should I be using this as an introductory post, to avoid multiple-thread disorder? New, easily confused person with a stupid username, fond of Pratchett (but haven&#39;t read all things Discworld yet, I&#39;m working on it), ditto Tamora Pierce, Good Omens, Ender&#39;s Game, the Attolia books, Graceling and the Hunger Games, and I have an embarrassing weakness for very guilty pleasures. I tend to outgrow them, though. Mostly. I also like slash, but hate when people defame a canon female love interest to do it. Oh yeah, something of an anime newbie-fan; ditto Kingdom Hearts, and a writer of (in my opinion) mediocrefic.(Also, confession time - I have never been able to finish the Honored Tolkien Trilogy. It&#39;s too sad and depressing and the pretty world that&#39;s dying and why does the magic have to be going away and WHY IS IT IMPOSSIBLE TO FIND A COPY WHERE THE TEXT IS MORE THAN A MILLIMETER HIGH and - yeah, you get the picture.)</p>

            <p>*poke*<br><br>And... hm. Gattsuru linked you to the PPC Lost Tales, and Dann gave you a bumper sticker, so... that&#39;s pretty much it. <sup>_<sup>;<br><br>I</sup></sup> will add that I don&#39;t recall anything about Middle-earth dying, or magic going away. I mean, yes, eventually all the elves do depart to Valinor, but they&#39;ll be the first to tell you that what they do isn&#39;t magic as we humans think of it. But the world is certainly not dying. It&#39;s under attack, and the whole point of the story is that everyone is fighting to save it. A lesson we all could do with in our world, really.<br><br>Anyway. If you&#39;d like to try a different medium, I highly recommend the BBC radio adaptation by Brian Sibley. You can listen to the first episode <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/RingsradioDrama#grid/user/4A696B8A12C0B6A0">here, in six parts</a>. Some things are cut due to time limitations, but unlike the travesties perpetrated by Peter Jackson, nothing drastic is added or changed here.<br><br>So, altogether, welcome!<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>The PPC wiki&#39;s a great place to start, and it&#39;ll eventually get you everywhere.  <a href="http://starshadowhall.tripod.com/ppc/index.html">Neshomeh&#39;s page</a> has a lot on both the in-universe guide side, links, and missions, and thus is highly recommended.  There&#39;s also <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/the_ppc/20306.html">The Big List of Everything PPC</a> if you&#39;ve got a lot of time to devote.  I&#39;d recommend <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/FAQ:_The_Board">the Board FAQ</a>.  If you plan to write PPC mission some day, take a look at <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Permission">the Permission article</a> and the <a href="http://www.freewebs.com/ppc_manual/index.htm">Manual</a> -- it&#39;s a good guide on what we do, and the humor we try to do it with.  Eventually, the <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Mission_Writing_Guide">Mission Writing Guide</a> is a big help as well.<br><br>You&#39;ve mentioned the wiki, so I&#39;ll assume you&#39;ve already see <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Legendary_badfic">the article on Legendary Badfic</a>.  Either way: before forewarned that they really are that bad and you don&#39;t (and if you want to keep whatever good taste you had, maybe shouldn&#39;t) feel like it&#39;s a test.  Reading normal badfic is enough of a masochistic thing; we&#39;d prefer you at stabbing insanity rather than brain-breakingly flamethrower crazy.<br><br>For things I enjoyed reading : Agent Trojanhorse and Paddlebrains have their missions posted <a href="http://rc45.dreamwidth.org/">at RC45</a>, and are <i>the</i> expert Bad Slashers, so be forewarned.  Laburnum has most of her <a href="http://www.keldale.f9.co.uk/tabularasa/writing.htm">completed mission logs and sporks here</a>, although you&#39;ll need to dig through her LiveJournal to find everything.  Some Mary Sues, mostly Bad Slash with Sue toppings.  <a href="http://sedri.livejournal.com/">Sedri</a> is quite worth reading.  <a href="http://julyppc.webs.com/">JulyFlame</a> is worth reading, especially for the horror that is a 1984!Sue.  The <a href="http://uncommon-comma.livejournal.com/">Department of Technical Errors</a> haven&#39;t updated in a long time, but they have some incredible work with viewpoint writing in there.  <a href="http://members.home.nl/indemaat/ppcindex.html">Indemaat</a> has a boatload of missions done.<br><br>Anyway, that&#39;s a couple of the things I found interesting when I started.<br><br>Ah, and before I forget... *rummages through stuff*...

            <p>Most spin-offs tend to follow the plot lines of a couple major characters, perhaps intersecting with other spin-offs but typically focusing on the growth of their own characters.  You might miss some of the smaller jokes if you jump into more recently started spin-offs, but they&#39;ve always got enough in common with The Original Series to be easy to follow.<br><br>  There are some big events that really shake things up -- the <a href="http://www.freewebs.com/ppchistory/ReorgTitle.htm">Reorganization</a>, <a href="http://www.freewebs.com/ppchistory/CrashTitle.htm">Crashing Down</a>, and the <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Macrovirus_Epidemic">2008 Macrovirus Epidemic</a> are probably the ones you&#39;ll see the most referenced.  These sort of Emergencies are starting to be reduced, and not everyone follows them to the letter.  <a href="http://www.freewebs.com/bonsaimallorn/index.htm">DOGA</a> and related works <strike>including those that of Departments that don&#39;t exist</strike> may also be worthwhile, although most of the times you see these they are only glossed over.  <a href="http://plotprotectors.tripod.com/">PPC: The Lost Tales</a>, run by Neshomeh, is probably the biggest collection of things from the Geocities and Oddlots crunch, but it is incomplete. <br><br>Dandelion fizz just a random thing.  I&#39;d probably think it something along the lines of the various <i>Redwall</i>, but it&#39;s just random.  It&#39;s considered polite to include  virtual items, bumper stickers, or assault during newbie greetings.  Lembas, for example, seems a common one, or offers of a barrel to put your sanity in while visiting.</p>

            <p>I know, but they are never mentioned (the two missing ones, anyway). Even in Unfinished tales they only get a brief mention, and that&#39;s only to say they vanished after they went to confront Sauron.</p>

            <p>Good ol&#39; Alatar and Pallando are never heard of again. I have a vague memory of Tolkien discussing the possibility of them leading resistance to Sauron in the far east of Middle Earth, or whether they too fell from their mission, but nothing definitive is ever mentioned about them.</p>

            <p>In my frequent umm... excursions into that site, I found an Article that may be of interest to the PPC and all things related to it:<br><br><a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RonTheDeathEater"><a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RonTheDeathEater">http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RonTheDeathEater</a></a><br><br>This Article is about how dumb, foolish Fanthings, because of various dumb, foolish Fanthing reasons, like shipping or rooting for the sexier villain *Froths* distort perfectly good (or at least non-villanous) characters into evil, sociopathic, and all-around OOC versions of themselves. Naturally, it deals with Fanfiction and Mary Sues. You may find sporkable material in it, as several of the entries have links to fanfic that is excreable, if not abdominable at best. *Smiles Creepily* Have Fun!<br><br>PS: Oh, and you should beware of the section relating to Harry Potter, as it seems that the aforementioned Fanthings have launched a Coup d&#39;etat in order to defend their vile mouthings. I&#39;d do something about it but I haven&#39;t the time to read the books because of online courses (in fact, i&#39;m actually borrowing time just to make posts longer than Welcome! plus token gift) and said excursions to the site (Yes, TV Tropes <i>Will</i> Ruin Your Life, I see that now).   <br><br><br><br><br></p>

            <p>There, you will find that the &#39;defenses&#39; of Fanthings treatment of Ron and Ginny were mare rather recently, and by a minority. They seem to be relying on volume in order to overwhelm the opposition. See TheFinalCountdown&#39;s edits for the most recent example, as well as why I consider it to be a shameless coup. Of course, it looks like a counterattack has started (his lines had already been deleted), but i&#39;m not certain that the Fanthings that attempted to foist their &#39;explenations&#39; on the Article would take this lying down.<br><br>Then again, I made the OP in a moment of anger, not expecting things to get better.

            <p>Hello!<br>It&#39;s a pleasure to meet you all. I just discovered your little organization, and realized, in some divine epiphany or something, that it would be a terrible tragedy if I didn&#39;t try to become apart of something so awesome.<br><br>To introduce myself:<br>I&#39;m username Unconquered, though given my email address my real name is not exactly hidden. I&#39;m &#39;slightly&#39; insane, massively egotistical yet at the same time deeply insecure, have a tendency to take things extremely seriously, sometimes about inconsequential details nobody else cares about.<br>I hate most things by default. If I like them, I take the slightest criticism of them personally. Particularly Tolkien. Anyone who goes against Tolkien better make peace with god (I sometimes get the two mixed up, but they are separate individuals). Also up there is Robert E Howard, Robert Jordan and a few other authors.<br>I&#39;m never as eloquent as I&#39;d like, though I&#39;m not bad. And I live for a discussion.<br>I can never leave things once their done, in particular my own attempts at writing, and keep taking them out to tinker with them, even after they&#39;re mostly done. And most of them never make it past draft stage anyway.<br>My hatred of Sues comes from an  unfortunate event in my childhood, that&#39;s ramifications I have never really psychologically recovered from.<br>I hate canon Sues nearly as much as inserts. But if I start on them, you&#39;ll never hear the end of me.<br>Aside from that I&#39;m a well-rounded, well-balanced individual.<br>In short, I should fit right in.</p>

            <p>This semester, one of my assignments for English class is to teach a class (or rather, make lesson plans for 5 fifty-minute classes) about an unit of writing of my choice. I decided to do a small unit for a Creative Writing class, and the goal is to write a character analysis, based on a character that the student creates. <br><br>So my question is, how do I explain the importance of Background, physical traits, emotions, relationships to other characters and actions to a class of high schoolers?

            <p>A unique combination of our backstory, physical traits, emotional reactions, and relationships makes us who we are. It&#39;s the same with characters. For that reason, not all of those things have to be unique (read: OMG uber speshul) to make an original character--they just have to COMBINE in a way that makes the character compelling and able to carry the story.<br><br>The thing about backstory in particular is that experiences in our childhood have an astounding impact on us, whether we like it or not. For example, someone raised Jewish may always keep kosher even if they stop going to synagogue. Someone like me, forced to listen to symphonic music and watch Olympic ice skating even when I didn&#39;t feel like it, may find as an adult that they appreciate them and even that those things are special to them. Nothing, unless they are extremely powerful things, will ever get under our skin like the things we experience as children.<br><br>Physical traits in literature are important in a different way: they can be and often are assigned symbolic significance whether the author means for it or not. Scars are the ones that come to mind instantly. A physical scar can often stand for an emotional scar. Perfect (if extreme) example: the Phantom of the Opera. It&#39;s not just his face that&#39;s making him so messed up. Less extreme example: Frodo Baggins, scarred once by the Nazgul blade and again by the loss of his finger, could also never recover emotionally and live a normal life in the Shire.<br><br>Other things, like glasses, are simply associated with certain traits, in this case intelligence (or possibly geekdom). However, being nearsighted might also indicate a tendency to miss the forest for the trees, whereas a farsighted person might overlook things they consider minor details in favor of the bigger picture. Being left-handed has long been associated with being evil, or backward, or contrary, or just not normal. Tattoos (excluding concentration camp ones) symbolize rebellion, but the specific tattoo can also mean anything you like. Beware, however, of hidden meanings in the symbol you choose. There may be associations you&#39;re not aware of.<br><br>Colors are a big deal, too. Having a character wear a certain color can say loads about them. Also, we all &quot;know&quot; things about blondes, red-heads, etc. Same goes for eye color--the reason Suethors go for weird eye colors is because it&#39;s a quick and dirty way to tell us that there&#39;s something special about the character without having to show it to us with story-telling.<br><br>This might be a good excuse to get into the &quot;show, don&#39;t tell&quot; principle. Just because something is a physical trait doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;re showing us.<br><br>Hence the importance of emotions, actions, and relationships. It&#39;s the character&#39;s behavior and speech that really show us what they&#39;re about. It&#39;s how they handle those things hanging around from their childhood that defines them, not those things themselves. It&#39;s how they use everything they&#39;ve got to solve problems, or fail to solve them, or whatever needs to happen.<br><br>And it&#39;s always important to remember that your characters can and will surprise you. It&#39;s a lot like kids: you can set them up with certain background experiences and basic traits, but eventually they will develop to the point where they start to go off in their own direction, and there&#39;s nothing you can do about it. Trying to control every detail will stifle them, leaving you with writer&#39;s block and possibly a dead story.<br><br>... I think I&#39;ve talked about enough now. <sup>_<sup>;</sup></sup> I hope that helps.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I teach ONE eight year old English (it pays pretty well, too!), and I have to make my own lesson plans for her. Typically, they consist of bringing a kid&#39;s book for her to read, and then just having her write and memorize random words xD </p>

            <p>Maybe I&#39;m just paranoid, but I&#39;m getting more and more concerned that just anybody can walk up to our Wiki and do (almost) anything to it, especially since it seems to be one of the first things newcomers find these days. Is there some way to set it up so that mods/admins/whatever can vet new accounts before they can make edits? I&#39;d be willing to do it; we don&#39;t usually get so many people signing up at once that it would be a bother.<br><br>This would also necessitate setting it up so that people have to log in to make edits, but I think everyone should do that anyway. {= p<br><br>I don&#39;t want to scare anyone off; quite the opposite: I want them to find their way here and become part of the community more easily, as opposed to wandering around the Wiki in confusion until one of us spots them and points them in the right direction. <i>Especially</i> if they&#39;re keen to get involved.<br><br>So...

            <p>Wikia policy is to avoid locking most pages at all, so the interface is relatively limited -- someone with Administrator/Bureaucrat access has to attack the <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Special:UserRights">Special:UserRights</a> page, if I recall MediaWiki right, which doesn&#39;t seem too fun.  On the other hand, a number of wiki edits from even established PPCers aren&#39;t always logged in, either for security or simplicity issues, and that may be frustrating when it&#39;s a rapidly-changing character page.<br><br>At the very least, putting relatively finalized stuff (the The Boards page, the FAQs, that sorta stuff) as SemiProtected should be relatively simple and prevent the sort of mangling the FAQ pages have gotten recently, and that&#39;s both easier and less intrusive than large-scale group changes.  Perhaps the Sunflower Official greeting could also be made much more obnoxious?  It&#39;s very well-written right now, but the important stuff isn&#39;t as quick to grab the eye as it could be.</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve meant to mention the SO&#39;s greeting, too. It would be nice if the really important links were spelled out instead of just saying &quot;here,&quot; and words like &quot;important,&quot; &quot;must,&quot; and &quot;expected&quot; wouldn&#39;t go amiss, either. A direct link to the Board should also be there. This IS the SO, after all. Officiously ordering people here and there is what he does. {= )<br><br>I don&#39;t see how NOT signing in is a security thing, though. It certainly isn&#39;t secure for the Wiki. As for simplicity, it&#39;s not that hard to log in. If you&#39;re using your own computer, you can just STAY logged in--no fuss, no bother. If not, then you just hit &quot;logout&quot; when you&#39;re done and close the browser window. Many public computers are set up to clear the cache/browser history automatically every time this happens, and if it isn&#39;t then you can do it yourself. If you&#39;re that worried about your data, you should do that anyway.<br><br>But really, when it comes to established PPCers, it&#39;s more about accountability. If you&#39;re doing something, and you don&#39;t want anyone to know you&#39;re doing it, chances are you SHOULDN&#39;T be doing it. On the other hand, if you&#39;re doing a lot of good stuff, it&#39;s nice to know who&#39;s doing it so we can appreciate the effort properly. Logging in also enables dialogue--it&#39;s really awkward and possibly pointless to try talking to an IP address, which may or may not be used again, and if people are logging in regularly there&#39;s a better chance of being able to get their attention if you want them specifically.<br><br>... What I REALLY don&#39;t get is how new people miss the PPC Intro Pages, which, if they looked at them, would solve a lot of problems. But that&#39;s a whole other kettle of fish.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Okay. I&#39;ve got some more questions, this time mostly in-universe ones.<br><br>How exactly does a continuum function? Does it...<br><br>a.

            <p>... a continuum/Word World/canon/whatever you want to call it functions like World One, and the canon stories etc are basically records of history, so the events of canon are things that have already happened - fics and sporkings therefore are sort of like &#39;going back in time&#39; to a certain place in the fic, so yes, everyone technically has free will but we know how events are going to unfold because we&#39;re in the position of people from the future, as it were.<br><br>Hope that helps!

            <p>Cliched, I know, but that&#39;s beside the point.<br><br>The point is, I feel like we&#39;re in a bit of a writing slump, and so I&#39;m putting a challenge to all of you in the hope of getting some enthusiasm going again. The challenge is: starting today, you have until <b>midnight, March 31</b> (in your respective time zones) to write a mission if you have Permission, or something else if you don&#39;t. It doesn&#39;t have to be beta-read by the 31st--that&#39;s asking too much of our pool of betas--but it has to be finished and available to read. It can be something new or something you&#39;ve had sitting on your back burner. It can be an individual, team, or group effort. However you do it, get it done!<br><br>I will consider what happens if you &quot;win&quot;. It just depends on how many of you make it happen, I guess.<br><br>Now, you&#39;ve got exactly four weeks. Go!<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I&#39;m going to be spending until midnight on the thirty first sitting back and waiting. &#39;Cause for the past year or so, if you subtracted mine and Trojie&#39;s posts, you&#39;d probably find bugger all missions posted, for the most part. The odd one here and there. Good ones, sometimes, too, but still just odd ones.<br><br>So we&#39;re sitting this one out. Trojie might try to write something, but my brain broke in September, and that&#39;s why we&#39;ve posted nothing since, and that&#39;s half of why it&#39;s seemed so quiet. Thank you all for noticing, and we&#39;ll be back when we&#39;ve something worth posting.</p>
