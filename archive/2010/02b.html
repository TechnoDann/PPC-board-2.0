            <p>I know that Canon is the Name of the Game here, but ever since  I saw the movie (and began reading internet discussion boards), some things have bugged me.. okay alot of things, but the seemingly exaggerated state of Earth&#39;s decay and the improbably large population (32 Billion?  Isn&#39;t it supposed to  peak at about 12 Billion about 50 years before the movie?) are the worst.  So... Here&#39;s my thoughts for an AU fic.<br><br>-Earth is.. not an Eden, but certainly not as bad as in the script.  Global Warming has taken it&#39;s toll, a third-world exodus has taken place, some ecosystems have dissappeared forever.  However, gigantic gene-banks house the DNA of every endangered species scientists could get their hands on, Bengal Tigers have been cloned after nearly 70 years of extinction and widespread fusion power (and extensive water-pipelines to even out the effects of drought and deluge) are finally beginning to allow us to heal much of the damage we inflicted.<br><br>-The Off-world Colonies (Luna and mars) are a slightly different story.  The Moon is an &quot;ivory Tower&quot; technocracy specializing in the research and manufacture of high-tech equipment and products (If that Clear-Screen don&#39;t say &quot;Made on Luna&quot;, it&#39;s junk)  Mars is an industrial colony /terraforming project, mostly populated by Third World overflow, fed with vast, subterranean algae farms and governed (at times) as an RDA Police State.  This was the source of the Scully Brothers, orphaned at 8 in a 3-week long uprising (which was put down in the interest of &quot;Industrial security&quot;)  Tom and Jake were then (borderline) adopted by the RDA, and schooled to serve them in the future.<br><br>Now, to Pandora.<br><br>-The changes here are stark.  First off, Hell&#39;s Gate is based around the Hometree of a Na&#39;vi clan that the RDA basically saved from starvation when they first arrived.  Mining is done around the roots mostly by a complicated and costly process of air-drilling and leaving ore-free pillars of rock to support the tree until they can put in better supports.  (though the removal of the mineral may soon show to have a detrimental effect in itself).<br><br>Selfridge is more competent, Quaritch is a UN-Mission Hero from the humanitarian interventions in West Africa (brought in to hopefully control the PMC thugs that RDA budgeted for this thing). The Local Na&#39;vi are becoming more acclimatized to Earth technology and social customs (or in the Words of Grace Augustine, &quot;Turning them into Welsh Coal Miners&quot;)<br><br>-The Omaticaya are much different.  Initially, they were as open to the idea as the others, but as the expansion plans became more fleshed out, doubts grew.  Total break-down occured when a group of young hunters were caught vandalizing pit-mining equipment (for an area that was supposed to be reclaimed later), were tracked to Dr. Augustine&#39;s school in the forest (who was there at the time), and were promptly shot up by Sgt. Lyle Wainfleet.  Grace&#39;s avatar spent a month in the base ICU... the oldest daughter of the Omaticaya clan leaders didn&#39;t make it, her death witnessed by her younger sister, Neytiri. <br><br>-The first signs of Quaritch&#39;s mental breakdown come when he was supposed to hand over Wainfleet to the Omaticaya in order to get some sort of peace out of it.  Quaritch claims he delivered Lyle, the Omaticaya deny it... and only Trudy Chachon, the Sampson pilot for that trip, knows the truth.  For the first half of the story, she stays quiet about it.<br><br>Well?  </p>

            <p>The Earth really *is* screwed-- so says the Word of Cameron. A direct quote from the guide to everything Avatar &quot;We&#39;ve devastated our planet. We&#39;re neck-deep in festering industrial muck, in a trash heap of ever-expanding waster and decay. Overpopulation, overdevelopment, nuclear terrorism, environmental warfare, radiation leakage from power plants and waste dumps, toxic runoff, air pollution, deforestation, global warming, ozone depletion, loss of bio-diversity through extinction...&quot; So much for the exaggerated state, Gandalf the Beige. Page one(of actual text), James Cameron&#39;s Avatar: An Activist Survival Guide.<br>In the section about flora, it says that plants from Pandora are being used to heal what&#39;s left of the Pittsburgh wastelands--and that they&#39;re *thriving.* Pandora&#39;s atmosphere is mostly CO2(18%+), Hydrogen Sulfide(toxic concentration less than 1%), Xenon(5.5%), and Argon, along with O2. Therefore, Earth *cannot* be as well off as you have tried to explain it.<br>Yes, there is a colony on the moon, but nothing about Mars-- sorry, but you&#39;re out of luck there. The moon is also, according to what I could find from official sources, a cess pit with more humans living in itty-bitty spaces than is safe(oh, and Earth&#39;s population is only 20 billion). <br>To address the Gene Banks--sorry, pretty much everything but worms, cockroaches, grubs, and humans are *EXTINCT* in every sense of the word. Power-- that&#39;s a big fish. There is an extreme energy crisis on Earth(not to mention overpopulation, eternal war, extermination of life as we know it...) is why people went to the stars(i.e. Pandora) in the first place. There is no ozone layer, all water is pretty much toxic--and tastes like turpentine after its been filtered to within an inch of its life. No, the damage is not being healed--not on the scale that you&#39;re suggesting. Enviromentalists from Na&#39;vi Nuts(TM) are smuggling flora in from Pandora to see if they can heal the Earth, but at the rate that the RDA is arresting and torturing/killing them, I don&#39;t think that&#39;s going to well.<br>The Sully brothers, that&#39;s *Sully,* dear, not *Scully,* were born and raised on Earth, and until Cameron says otherwise, I&#39;m going to say that their parents are still alive(oh, and I claim that Mini).<br>On the Hell&#39;s Gate--Omaticaya and Hometree situation- The RDA was never allowed to mine there in the first place. That&#39;s why they destroyed Hometree in the movie. Yes, they did mine, but they were never near Hometree. The Omaticaya clan would also never have been near starvation. The planet has incredible sustainable growth--where Earth is spiraling out of control(and into a toxic hell), Pandora maintains a constant equilibrium. They wouldn&#39;t have needed saving, and even if they did, they would have gone to another clan or Eywa(through the Tree of Souls)for help. Selfridge is, pardon my language, an evil corporate bastard. Quaritch is,  once again pardon my language, an evil sadistic bastard from the depths of whatever hell spawned him. But he is a good soldier, I&#39;ll give him that. But a UN hero? Nah. One--the UN no longer exists, two--Quaritch likes killing people too much.<br>Have you done the i-phone app? Cause that&#39;s the only place I know of where the mining equipment was destroyed--it was only one BULLDOZER, and it was set on fire. Grace&#39;s Avatar never spent a month in ICU(from what *I* know), as she wasn&#39;t able to intervene before the hunters and Sylwanin were killed by the RDA--not Wainfleet specifically. And, from the incident you were talking about, Wainfleet wasn&#39;t there, nor was Quaritch. Quaritch arrived after Major Cage got his ass handed to him in a spectacular fashion by the Omaticaya(an Avatar named Lorenz, specifically). Trudy Chacon(ooh, another mini--You can have it, it&#39;s a mini-Turok named Trudy Chachon) would also have arrived with Quaritch, thus, she wouldn&#39;t have been able to witness the incident with Lorenz, the Omaticaya, and Major Cage.<br>I do apologize for poking holes in what might have been a great theory, but I had to. I love Avatar &#39;verse too much not to. And, this topic has already been picked over before(yes, I remember you), and should now stop. Earth is a cesspool of toxic waste, Pandora is an atmospherically-toxic paradise, and Quaritch and Selfridge are both assholes.<br>James Cameron is the Avatar &#39;verse God. What he says is Canon is FACT, therefore, when anyone says anything differently, we must stop them. I suggest reading the Survival Guide for more information.<br>Sincerely, the nitpicker;<br>     -Honu_Wahine          </p>

            <p>My, quite acidic, don&#39;t you think?<br><br>You seem to be forgetting that the PPC is about fun, and fanfiction is about fun as well, and AUs can be fun, and if the Great Beige One cares to have a bit of fun in the sandbox, and is looking for opinions of others from a place they&#39;ve frequented for far longer than you, the proper response is NOT to nit pick the fur off the dog.<br><br>The Avatar &#39;verse, I&#39;m pretty sure, is nicely grounded in SOFT science fiction.<br><br>Maybe not as soft as O HAI MR SKYWALKER THAT SURE IS A NICE LIGHTSABER YOU HAVE THAR, but by no means is it a world of hard hard science fiction.<br><br>Surprisingly, one IS allowed to not check every single thing in extracanonical material when making an AU, since y&#39;know, alternate universe is alternative, the Pearl Jam to AC/DC, and extra stuff costs extra, after all.<br><br>Just because you&#39;re on the Board now  and with the PPC doesn&#39;t mean you can treat everything as serious business and as if it is an affront to the holy, oh so holy, idea of writing fanfiction if it deviates even slightly from canon or your own personal preferences. <br><br>Teal Deer:<br><br>Shaddup, calm down, get over yourself and your fandom a bit, this is for fun, not profit.</p>

            <p>I apologize. I am a nutcase, I forgot to read his entire post(specifically the part about his wanting to write an AU), when I wrote my reply. I did not intend to cause any harm, but  the fanfiction that seems to be coming out about Avatar is pretty much bad--what I&#39;ve found at least--and it&#39;s making me rather cranky, and prone to being rather rude. If I&#39;ve offended the board too much, I&#39;ll just stop posting in this thread, and find something else to read.<br>After the last bit of fanfiction, I&#39;ve become obsessed with the facts and canon of Avatar &#39;verse to the point of becoming a bitchy, nasty, slightly sadistic person. I am in love with the Avatar universe, and, yes, while some of it seems over the top, it is what&#39;s canon, until Cameron puts out the next two movies or other proof to the contrary.<br>Once again--apologies for being just a bit too obsessive over my canon of choice.<br>-Honu_Wahine</p>

            <p>(For those who are interested, it&#39;s channel #PPC on Blitzed, by the way)<br><br>Contrary to what has been posted, simply being an AU definitely does not make a fic badfic, either in reality or in the eyes of this community. Conversely, though, saying &quot;This is an AU&quot; is no shield for bad writing and poor logic.<br><br>Creating a good AU isn&#39;t the easiest - To paraphrase Earthsea, to change a part of the world is to change the entire world. Anything you change will have (or will have had) consequences that shake the entire storyline, and a lot of authors don&#39;t take the time to think them through. That is what makes so many AUs badfic, not the fact that they start from a different series of assumptions.<br><br>I haven&#39;t seen Avatar, so I can&#39;t comment on how well what you&#39;ve come up with fits with the movie and other Canon. However, you have some very good points. 32 billion is an immense number, way beyond what a 50 years post-peak civilization would have. Your changes to Pandora are slightly more concerning to me - once again, I haven&#39;t seen the film, but from what I&#39;ve heard, it&#39;s very much a humans-are-bad type thing. This would make putting Hell&#39;s Gate in a hometree and saving a clan of Na&#39;vi very much out of character for the Canonical RDA.<br><br>To summarize, AUs are perfectly valid. Any fanfiction that deviates from the Canon at all is essentially asking &quot;what if?&quot; - all calling a fic &#39;AU&#39; really says is that the &quot;what if&quot; happened in the past instead of the present. However, AUs are very easy to do poorly, so you&#39;re going to have to put a lot of extra thought into making sure everything works out right. Remember the butterfly effect - even tiny changes can have massive consequences.</p>

            <p>That&#39;s an angle I hadn&#39;t considered. It does sort of change the feel of the Canon from the whole &quot;humans are evil&quot; thing (which I think is overdone and dogmatic, anyways), but it makes a lot of sense.</p>

            <p>I should apologize for that rant. You said you were wanting to write an *AU* for the universe. *headwall* I should probably have read your post a bit better. But still, even with an AU label, you&#39;d be stretching canon pretty far. Look at what happens to Lord of the Rings, especially concerning poor Legolas. And most, if not all of those fics have an AU label on them.<br>I&#39;m not saying that an AU is a bad thing, but that your constructed idea is a fairly shaky one. You&#39;d be tossing aside or ignoring most of the canon facts, and tossing aside ones that are integral to the structure of the universe. If you have the Omaticaya near starvation, then you&#39;d be destroying Pandora, a beautiful planet with incredible sustainable growth. There is a complete equilibrium on that planet, and according to Word of Cameron, Earth food is horrible. I wouldn&#39;t touch it with a 39 1/2 foot pole. Algae and grubs? Eww.<br>But the incident that you were wanting to put in your story-- pretty good, solid idea. Maybe put it with another clan? Maybe the Tipani, or make one of your own?<br>If I think of any other nit-picky ideas for you, I&#39;ll post &#39;em here, or contact you (where do I do that, anyways?).<br>-Abelas,<br>     Honu_Wahine</p>

            <p>I meant that ANOTHER, fictional clan would be the one&#39;s near starvation and under the RDA thumb... and probably because of something that the RDA (or the exploration party) probably caused.  I based this off of something in the original Project 880 script, where Grace (her avatar, i assume) is in an intimate relationship with one of the &quot;Base Na&#39;vi&quot;.  <br><br>And I know that Canon Earth is a hellhole, but I just feel that it doesn&#39;t fit with current projections (population levels) or even other canon stuff (possible fusion power, so what would be the major source of pollution?).<br><br>Alright, that&#39;s a bit naive, but if (in my version, mars and the moon have been colonized for industry, then Earth would have to become an agricultural world to feed everyone (hence the destruction of natural ecosystems to replace it with high-intensity agriculture).<br><br>So cliff notes:<br><br>-RDA messed something up, a Na&#39;vi clan payed the price, RDA played &quot;savior&quot; and introduced video games, refined sugar and rock&amp;roll<br><br>-A mixture of staffing decisions populates hells gate with both the cream of the scientific crop and a bunch of mercenary thugs (though they bring in the All-American Hero to teach them discipline... too bad he may be going insane)<br><br>-The Omaticaya, a clan further into the foothills, start a guerilla insurgency when first their Olo&#39;eyktans eldest daughter is killed, and secondly when they begin to discover that the mining is actually beginning to kill the Hell&#39;s Gate Kelkutral.<br><br>-unobtainium is worth 1 Billion a Kilo.<br><br>-Situation on earth is a little more realistic (in a lot of peoples opinions), by being COMPARATIVELY crappy, not &quot;half the theatre audience commits suicide&quot; crappy.   </p>

            <p>Hehe. That last one was kinda funny. <br>Unobtanium(and this is just a nutty quibble), is worth 40 mill a Kilogram. Funny thing--one geek on the wiki calculated the cost to make the movie in unobtanium, and it came to 11.85 kg of the stuff. Gross revenue came to 119.5525 kg. Yeah, I look these up because I have no life to speak of.<br>And, well, those projections are *current*. Who says they can&#39;t change? But that idea could work...if you worked really hard... But the power is mostly nuclear, and the fusion thing wouldn&#39;t work, as I see it(for Hade&#39;s sake, they&#39;re still using *rockets*), but with a bit of fancy footwork, it might work. Yeah, the moon&#39;s been colonized, and I supposed by then Mars would have been to... Just put all my insane replies to your stuff as insane anger left over from a fic by some fanbrat with a horrendous, horrendous, horrendous grasp of canon. But still.... Eh. Just ignore the insane girl--I&#39;ve been a Avatard since day one(what can I say, I&#39;m obsessive).<br>Before you put any Na&#39;vi dialouge in, could you please read the Na&#39;vi dictionary in the back of the Activist Survival Guide? Reading fanfiction&#39;s phonetic spelling of Na&#39;vi and some of the made up words are...painful.<br>Good luck with your story--and if I review, please know that I nitpick everything to death. It&#39;s a bad, bad habit I learned from Tirathon (on the Pit).<br>-Honu_Wahine(the Avatar nitpicker)</p>

            <p>Most of the low tech weaponry in the movie was due to isolation (they could make it on-site) and the peculiar magnetic fields that would screw with the workings of guns running on magnetic propulsion.

            <p>Nope, not really. Fusion takes second base to antimatter(it&#39;s kind of...mentioned once-ish in over 200 pages of minuscule writing, and nowhere on the sites) The only ship(now that I look in my guidebook--d&#39;oh *headwall*) is the ISV Venture Star, and I think that got... No, the shuttle was blown up, not the big ship in orbit. Oh well. <br>The weaponry available--well, given the current trend, it could be available in the next 20 to 30 years (50 at the most).<br>All it is, is our stuff on steroids with &quot;smarter&quot; computers and really big freakin&#39; guns. The guns are cool though... <br>Some of the stuff *can* however, be taken out with a well-placed rock or a good tripwire(at the height of your choice: decapitation, anyone?).<br>Probably the most advanced (IMHO) piece of weaponry that they have would be the MBS-22A Automated Sentry Gun. It&#39;s a big honkin piece of shit(compared to some of the stuff most sci-fi geeks come up with in twenty minutes), fires ball bearings, tracer rounds, and needles. Nasty little bastard, huh?<br>Everything else is stuff like chainsaws, machine guns, and SNS&#39;s on steroids like it was going out of style.<br>If you want any of the specs, just ask.(How big do you think we can make this thread before they tell us to quit?)<br>-Honu_Wahine(the giggling maniac with a book)</p>

            <p>Again. I already poked you in the chat, but this is the <i>official</i> one. *poke*<br><br>Hmm... Dann already gave you a bumper sticker, so that just leaves this: in addition to the links Ansela has provided, you may wish to visit the <a href="http://plotprotectors.tripod.com/">PPC Lost Tales</a> archive, which is the only place to find some of the things written contemporarily with the Original Series since GeoCities bit the big one.

            <p>I comes bearing links. *drags out Big Bag O&#39; Links and digs through it*<br><br>First off is the link to the <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/PPC_Wiki">Wiki</a>, a veritable fount of information for a newbie to read through. Especially helpful for you if you want to write missions would be the page on <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Permission">Permission</a> (note the capital P).<br><br>I would advise against reading any <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Legendary_badfic">Legendary Badfic</a>, unless you are of strong mind and stomach. Even the summaries have been known to give those of weaker constitution nightmares.<br><br>For your reading pleasure, not knowing what you have already managed to find, I have several links for you. <a href="http://www.misssandman.com/PPC/story.html">The Original Series</a> (not to be confused with Star Trek) is a good place to start, as the PPC did many aeons ago. <s>What do you mean I&#39;m exaggerating?</s> <a href="http://www.freewebs.com/bonsaimallorn/">The Department of Geographical Aberrations</a> is another interesting place to visit, if you have the time and inclination. Also by hS is the <a href="http://www.freewebs.com/ppchistory/index.htm">Tangled Webs</a> site, which contains backstory for the PPC as an organisation. If you would rather visit the Floaters, then <a href="http://julyppc.webs.com/">July&#39;s site</a> is the place you need to be. And last, but most definitely not least, <a href="http://rc45.dreamwidth.org/">Response Centre 45</a> is where Trojie and Pads&#39; missions are archived.<br><br>Hope you enjoy your stay here. Please deposit your sanity into the container offered to you by another Boarder; you won&#39;t be needing it here. </p>

Especially helpful for you if you want to write missions would be the page on <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Permission">Permission</a> (note the capital P).<br><br>I would advise against reading any <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Legendary_badfic">Legendary Badfic</a>, unless you are of strong mind and stomach. Even the summaries have been known to give those of weaker constitution nightmares.<br><br>For your reading pleasure, not knowing what you have already managed to find, I have several links for you. <a href="http://www.misssandman.com/PPC/story.html">The Original Series</a> (not to be confused with Star Trek) is a good place to start, as the PPC did many aeons ago. <s>What do you mean I&#39;m exaggerating?</s> <a href="http://www.freewebs.com/bonsaimallorn/">The Department of Geographical Aberrations</a> is another interesting place to visit, if you have the time and inclination. Also by hS is the <a href="http://www.freewebs.com/ppchistory/index.htm">Tangled Webs</a> site, which contains backstory for the PPC as an organisation. If you would rather visit the Floaters, then <a href="http://julyppc.webs.com/">July&#39;s site</a> is the place you need to be.

            <p>I tend to think of my characters through the lenses of my roleplaying background.  I look at two sets of opposing factors: virtue/vice and merits/flaws.<br><br>Virtues and vices are a good way to broadly define your character.  Virtues include Temperance, Hope, Faith and Justice, among others.  Vices can include any of the Seven Deadly Sins.  Giving your character these two elements should add a bit of imperfection, so long as you stay true to them.<br><br>Merits and flaws are more specific.  For merits, any attribute that gives your character an advantage over other people: eidetic memory, ambidexterity, being unusually strong or pretty.  Flaws are, of course, the opposite: addiction, cowardly, deficiency in a sense, having an embarrassing secret, aloofness.  The most important thing I find is to balance the merits and flaws.  If your character has a merit that boarders on mythic then give them a flaw that is equally mythic to balance it out.<br><br>These things will not only allow you to create imperfect characters, they will also help you create characters that are easy for a reader to identify with.</p>

            <p>Just make them like regular people, I guess. Normal, real-world people are imperfect--they&#39;re good at some things and terrible at others; they make mistakes; they do things even when they know they shouldn&#39;t, they <i>don&#39;t</i> do things even when they know they <i>should</i>. Sometimes (often) things don&#39;t work out in their favor. And yet they also do good and right things, often when it really matters, and sometimes it works out for them. That&#39;s about it, really. *shrug* Maybe other people will have more to say.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>My tips:<br><br>1) Don&#39;t have everything work perfectly - the world gets in the way a lot of the time in real relationships<br><br>2) Have them argue, misunderstand, sulk etc etc as well as be happy, cuddly, sexy etc<br><br>3) Consider writing from one POV so that you can see one person&#39;s thought processes, insecurities and worries about their relationship, and the things they&#39;re happy about, excited about, looking forward to etc.<br><br>Really *consider* why these characters are together or getting together in your story. If the only reason you can come up with is that you think they&#39;re attractive as a couple, then don&#39;t write the pairing :)<br><br>And practice! You won&#39;t write a perfect story the first time. Just keep trying! You don&#39;t have to post every attempt, obviously, but run every attempt past a beta and get their honest opinion as to whether it&#39;s a good story. Look around for good romance stories, ask for recs from people, and try to notice what makes the good stories good.<br><br>- Trojie<br><br>PS: Have fun!<br><br></p>

            <p>Well, you&#39;d better not read these fics then. Evangelion is a tight-knit fandom, which occasionally delves into that sort of stuck-up &quot;I can interpret this highly ambiguous series better than you can&quot; bit but otherwise is really devoted to the canon.<br><br>Unfortunately, even here lies badfic, and a lot of it is really, REALLY gross. I&#39;m warning you, the following is NSFW.<br><br><a href="http://www.mediaminer.org/fanfic/view_ch.php/8741/16410#fic_c"><a href="http://www.mediaminer.org/fanfic/view_ch.php/8741/16410#fic_c">http://www.mediaminer.org/fanfic/view_ch.php/8741/16410#fic_c</a></a><br><br>Okay, first up, we have &quot;Obsession,&quot; and what a turkey it is. Shinji&#39;s all grown up and is Vice-Commander of NERV (oh, like he would agree to that), and has a cute little daughter, Eve, with Asuka. But Shinji has a dark secret involving necrophilia, Eve turns out to be Rei&#39;s, not Asuka&#39;s, through some lengthily-explained hooey that makes no sense, and child molestation, child abuse, reincarnation, murder, and Rei&#39;s real name apparently being &quot;Kiboo&quot; ensue. Easily EVA&#39;s most infamous fic; were it in a bigger fandom, it might even qualify for Legendary, or at least &quot;famously disgusting&quot; status.<br><br><a href="http://anime.adultfanfiction.net/story.php?no=544216205"><a href="http://anime.adultfanfiction.net/story.php?no=544216205">http://anime.adultfanfiction.net/story.php?no=544216205</a></a><br><br>But compared to our second feature, &quot;Obsession&quot; is Citizen Kane. &quot;Boys Will Be Boys&quot; features the brutal &quot;interrogation&quot; of Kaji by Gendo, who&#39;s thrown his canonical magnificent bastardry to the wind to become an &quot;Agony in Pink&quot;-style kink torturer, whose repertoire includes hooks through the hands, anal rape, peeing in his mouth, and forcing him to eat his baby son. And no, I am NOT kidding about the last part. This author&#39;s other &quot;work&quot; includes a horrendous Warhammer crossover, a story about Rei finding happiness with a pet cat... which proceeds to die horribly, and a story called &quot;Rape: It&#39;s What&#39;s for Dinner!&quot; which I haven&#39;t checked out yet but, umm... huh. TVTropes postulates that if you read this guy&#39;s work in the right order, Hastur will appear.<br><br>So... yeah. Umm... enjoy? Can you really say that? </p>

            <p>(WARNING: ACTUAL SCIENCE!)<br><br>I was reading through my latest edition of Science News lately, and I found out something quite interesting. You see, the brain receives color in two channels: R/G and B/Y. All colors seen are made by the brain mixing blue or yellow with red or green. However, no color can ever appear bluish AND yellowish, or reddish AND greenish, because the different responses of the color channels are in opposition. (It&#39;s like trying to flex your bicep and tricep at the same time: the opposing impulses cancel eachother out.)<br><br>However, recent research has shown that under special conditions, the opposing-color theory is incorrect. When two opposing colors of equal luminance are placed side-by-side, and the image is stable on the viewer&#39;s retinas, the border between blue and yellow will blur, and you&#39;ll perceive a solid field of Blello (or Reen, if you&#39;re using reddish green).<br><br>Sadly, Urple cannot be produced with this method (as pink and purple are not opposing colors) but it&#39;s kind of neat, don&#39;t you think?</p>

            <p>Science is awesome.  I&#39;ve always been kind of intrigued by the idea of metamers -- that&#39;s the red, green, and blue channels that we use to perceive color, and all color is a combination of use of those three.  Well, apparently there are people who have an extra metamer, and can perceive an extra dimension of color.  These people are mostly women, who can perceive color changes in a person&#39;s face that most of us can&#39;t --changes that are indicitive of health alternations when you&#39;re getting sick.  Pretty cool, huh?</p>

            <p>If I remember class right, all women have four metamers - the usual red, green, and blue, plus a fourth that&#39;s a red-orange. Usually, it&#39;s so close to red that there&#39;s no visual difference, but in some cases, it&#39;s distinct enough that it gives them crazy amounts of color sensitivity.</p>

            <p>Since RPF is unlikely to have monsters we can use for Minis, what do we use if an actor or singer&#39;s name is misspelled?<br><br>Also, I think we need Minis for the Gorillaz (the cartoon band with the creepy character designs). I know none of their fic&#39;s been sporked yet, but there&#39;s an impressive number of ways to misspell the name &quot;Niccals&quot;. Mini-Ravens? Or did Cortez arrive too late in the storyline? Mini-Zombies? Maybe the zombie gorillas from the &quot;Clint Eastwood&quot; video?</p>

            <p>I&#39;m pretty sure there was a decision made at some point that minis shouldn&#39;t just be randomly decided--it&#39;s the person who first writes an OFU for the fandom or, if there isn&#39;t an OFU, then the person who first writes a mission with minis in the fandom who gets to decide the type of the minis. Sort of like a discoverer&#39;s right to name their discovery. Also, it prevents a build-up of miscellaneous information that isn&#39;t connected to anything. So, if you&#39;re actually going to do something with this, then it&#39;s fine, but if not then leave it for someone who is, okay? {= )<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Since Real Fic takes place in the real world, it kind of messes up how Minis are supposed to work.  Should we perhaps decide on one type of Mini to cover misspellings in all RealFic?  The problem with that is there isn&#39;t really a &quot;monster&quot; for Earth, unless you count Bigfoot or the Loch Ness Monster, which some people don&#39;t believe exist.<br><br>Or, we could say that misspelled singers make a Mini-Microphone, misspelled actors a Mini-Video Camera, or something like that.</p>

            <p>That website is awesome! I tried out the &quot;Do-it-yourself&quot; Suefic and it was surprisingly accurate and funny, due to the fact that I just randomly gave the prompter words mostly from my PPC lingo. And I misspelled words. On purpose. Oh, the lulz that resulted when I read it. Everyone has to try it out themselves, seriously.</p>

            <p>I comes bearing links. *drags out Big Bag O&#39; Links and digs through it*<br><br>First off is the link to the <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/PPC_Wiki">Wiki</a>, a veritable fount of information for a newbie to read through. Especially helpful for you if you want to write missions would be the page on <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Permission">Permission</a> (note the capital P).<br><br>I would advise against reading any <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Legendary_badfic">Legendary Badfic</a>, unless you are of strong mind and stomach. Even the summaries have been known to give those of weaker constitution nightmares.<br><br>For your reading pleasure, not knowing what you have already managed to find, I have several links for you. <a href="http://www.misssandman.com/PPC/story.html">The Original Series</a> (not to be confused with Star Trek) is a good place to start, as the PPC did many aeons ago. <s>What do you mean I&#39;m exaggerating?</s> <a href="http://www.freewebs.com/bonsaimallorn/">The Department of Geographical Aberrations</a> is another interesting place to visit, if you have the time and inclination. Also by hS is the <a href="http://www.freewebs.com/ppchistory/index.htm">Tangled Webs</a> site, which contains backstory for the PPC as an organisation. If you would rather visit the Floaters, then <a href="http://julyppc.webs.com/">July&#39;s site</a> is the place you need to be. And last, but most definitely not least, <a href="http://rc45.dreamwidth.org/">Response Centre 45</a> is where Trojie and Pads&#39; missions are archived.<br><br>Hope you enjoy your stay here. Please deposit your sanity into the container offered to you by another Boarder; you won&#39;t be needing it here. </p>

            <p>There&#39;s children of the Big Three, naturally; those were unavoidable from the start. *sigh* I wonder, how does one miss the fact that the oath-breaking is a supremely bad plan?<br>But, beside the expected, there&#39;s also: children of Kronos, children who are 2/3 god, children of random other gods, probably both real and invented, Egyptian gods... oh, and several people who don&#39;t seem to be able to count, but that&#39;s nothing new.<br>It makes me sad. The books are excellent, IMO. Why must their subject matter be butchered?<br>...never mind. I remember. Because it&#39;s there, and there&#39;s a movie of it.

            <p>I don&#39;t actually know; I&#39;ve not been to the movie yet. I&#39;m almost dreading it at this point.

            <p>Single? <br>Couldn&#39;t care less? <br>Yeah, me too.<br>Seriously, it&#39;s been months since I&#39;ve read a book or seen a movie in which nobody ended up in a romantic relationship with anybody else. I&#39;m not suggesting that romance should be entirely purged from the media, but really. I find myself muttering under my breath, &quot;Gah! Stop looking at him with &#39;a new understanding&#39;! Just go off and stab some monsters! That&#39;s why you were written! And you! It doesn&#39;t matter if you upset her, because she&#39;s an idiot! Quit worrying about it!&quot; It&#39;s like, no character goes through a novel without acquiring a significant other. If they&#39;re gay, that is the whole story and there&#39;s no plot other than &quot;can we be gay or not?&quot; and in the end they can, hurrah, caviar all around. Every story needs to have twu wuv in it somewhere. Discuss?</p>

            <p>Part of it is human nature. Part of it is human stupidity (though I&#39;m not quite sure there&#39;s a difference between nature and stupidity). Part of it is film producers who have this great action movie and think only guys will want to see it, so they try to appeal to the female crowd by adding romance. *rolls eyes* <br><br>Why do you think I&#39;m sort of fed up with the Romance genre at the moment? It&#39;s not that I hate Romance. It&#39;s that it&#39;s everywhere! Why? People want to know what happens next. It&#39;s an overused cliffhanger that keeps people watching these movies and shows or reading these books. Will so-and-so end up with this person or that person? Le gasp! This character kissed this random person at the end of the movie! Oh, I guess I&#39;ll have to see the next sequel to find out what happened!<br><br>*sigh* Human nature. At least it means that we have an instinct for this sort of thing, right? As in, we may end up overpopulating the earth, but as long as there aren&#39;t any apocalypses, nuclear wars, plagues, climate disturbances, or badly functioning governments, we&#39;ll never have to worry about dying out, right? <br><br>Personally, I don&#39;t mind Romance all that much. I wish they&#39;d come up with a more original way to keep people interested, though. And I hate nearly all of the Romance clichйs, so I&#39;m getting bored with seeing this everywhere. <br><br>Anyone else think that they do this to keep the viewers watching a plotless two-hour movie, among other things? </p>

            <p>I think the reason romance plots are more glaring in movies is because the entire romance has to get shoehorned into the parts of the two, three hour movie left over from the main plot.  This leads to a situation where the audience is still just getting to know these characters, and now that guy and that gal are already jumping at each other&#39;s lips.  The same is kind of true in a stand-alone novel.  In a longer book series or television show, we can be slowly led into the romance one scene at a time over multiple chapters/seasons, so it feels less forced and more like a natural progression of the characters&#39; storylines.<br><br>I don&#39;t mind romance between action-oriented characters, so long as the romance doesn&#39;t completely disable them DURING the fight scenes.</p>

            <p>RL asexual here. Meaning to come out to the people who know me in real life because I&#39;d like my parents to stop thinking I&#39;m just a social failure. Eventually.<br><br>Also busy writing a novel in which the main character does not end up in a relationship, because A) she&#39;s thirteen and B) she has better things to worry about. Two of her gang members sort of have a thing going, and there&#39;s two guys between whom I&#39;m going to intentionally include as much Ho Yay as possible because if I don&#39;t actually state that they&#39;re gay then the fans who don&#39;t like slash will ignore it and the fans who do like it would imagine it was there even if it wasn&#39;t.

            <p>Human interest (which is not a synonym for romance) is not lame, especially when it comes to war movies. Most of them aren&#39;t just about fighting; most of them are at least in part meant to show how demanding, how awful war is for the people doing the fighting, which is something very important to remember. If they add in a few romantic liaisons, that&#39;s just part of the whole cloth because it&#39;s one of the few ways those guys have to relax and NOT go completely nuts. Though some of them will anyway, unfortunately.<br><br>I do agree with you about the latter, though.

I&#39;m talking about &quot;Transformers: The Movie&quot; romance, which seems to infect nearly every movie but is named after the movie in which it stood out the most.  If you want to do a mature take on it that is juxtaposed with a war that&#39;s cool, but most screenwriters don&#39;t seem to do this.</p>

            <p>So, I had this idea last year in May to write a list of silly rules called &quot;Things I Am Not Allowed To Do In Tortall&quot;, a spin-off of all those other fandom rule lists. After procrastinating, asking fans of Tortall for their opinion, and giving myself a large number of headaches, I have taken the original first ten off of fanfiction.net (so that I&#39;m not illegal there anymore). In it&#39;s place is the short, not-to-be-continued prologue of the spin-off, but I don&#39;t like it, so I won&#39;t bother to link people. <br><br>Where was I?<br><br>Oh, yes. My final list of rules is up, which I&#39;ll link you all to soon. First, though, I have to clarify something: I&#39;m letting go of the reins so that some other fan can make rules. So, yeah. If you want to create more rules for the silly thing, feel free. It&#39;s been more trouble than it&#39;s worth. (And the reason why there are three different types of fonts is beyond me. It&#39;s some glitch I can&#39;t fix.)<br><br><a href="http://essi54.livejournal.com/1828.html">Link</a></p>

            <p>Please, PLEASE forgive me if I&#39;m ruffling any feathers, but... am I the only one who&#39;s noticed that this Board seems to have gotten noticeably more serious recently? The overall tone of the posts, I mean. It started, I think, back in what I&#39;ve taken to calling the &quot;Bloody June Days&quot; last year. You know what I&#39;m referring to, right?<br><br>Anyway, most of it was concentrated there, but since then, I&#39;ve noticed less mission plugs overall, more off-topic threads, several threads about political activism (which, while I applaud, has its time and place, and to me that doesn&#39;t seem to be here), and even a couple accusations of Suethor-dom.<br><br>So, at least to my perspective, there&#39;s been an observable drop in the crack? What&#39;s going on? I want my crack back...<br><br>For instance:<br><br>HAIL NURGLE!</p>

            <p>With fire, preferably. With *lots* of fire. Take a look at this--<a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/1159192/1/New_World"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/1159192/1/New_World">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/1159192/1/New_World</a></a> In the first chapter, in her disclaimer section, she insults her readers by calling them stupid. Then she introduces a Warrior!Brat!Bitch!sue. Legolas sounds like a idiotic teenager from earth(on that note, so is the author). At least Thranduil isn&#39;t an evil!manipulative!bastard of a dad in this fic--thank Hades for small favors. <br>I&#39;m just wondering-- how long will it take for some random elf to accidentally-on-purpose shoot the &#39;Sue and her men. I&#39;m personally rooting for the latter, rather than a horrendous fangirl Legomance. Also in the first chapter, she threatens the warriors of Mirkwood, and the king, and the prince. I have to wonder why she isn&#39;t dead yet? Maybe Sauron&#39;s protecting her...<br>In the second chapter... well, lets just say that I wished the orcs had gotten her first. And that Kevin hadn&#39;t run out of ammo and shot his commander, also knowns as General Faith(a.k.a the &#39;Sue). I&#39;m also waiting for Thranduil to throw her off a cliff, or for Legolas to beat him to the punch. <br>And that was when I stopped reading, because I was crying from the horror of the story. <br>Could someone drown me in the Fountain of Bleeprin now?<br>Honu_Wahine</p>

            <p>...And, in the words of a certain singer, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/19/opinion/19bono.html">Do You Know Where Your Soul Is</a>? <s><sub>Yes, that&#39;s right, another awkward and heavy-handed prod from your resident crazy activist about worldwide slavery!</sub></s><br><br>This is not about giggling in the hallways over balloons and teddy bears, or sending dagger-glares to the girl in the front row with all the flowers from your corner (though if anybody wants to put up a thread about that, I&#39;ll gladly come commiserate), or anti-commercialism, or anti-anti-commercialism-killjoys (like me!), or even the fact that Saudi Arabia has just outlawed celebration of Valentine&#39;s Day (no, I&#39;m not kidding).<br><br>This is about chocolate. Yes, chocolate! That most delicious of foods, that symbol of young love and luxurious romance.<br><br>This is actually about more than chocolate. This is about chocolate and slavery, and the fact that the two are very, very closely linked. Most mainstream chocolate companies-- and by &quot;most&quot; I mean &quot;almost all of&quot;-- get an overwhelming majority of their cocoa from the West Coast of Africa-- Ghana, Cote d&#39;Ivoire. Most of this chocolate comes from huge slave plantations, the workers of which are mostly young teenagers, kidnapped from Mali, where they&#39;d set out looking for jobs to feed their families, in one of the very poorest countries in this world. They&#39;re worked to the bone, starved, beaten, kept locked up at night to keep from trying to escape, and live in utterly horrible conditions. And all this-- all this cruelty, this pain, this stupid, stupid wickedness-- to satisfy the cravings of the Western world-- for candy. To give our sweet tooth a hit.<br><br>Think about that for a second. Young teenagers being beaten to death so that young teenagers can get a cheap candybar on their way home from school. Slavery feeding romance, for what can a guy give his girl that&#39;s more romantic than a chocolate rose? Slavery feeding happiness-- for which of us hasn&#39;t seen the Hershey&#39;s commercials, little kids with smiles on their faces?<br><br>Guys. <i>It doesn&#39;t have to be this way.</i> We can <i>do</i> something about this. <br><br><a href="http://vision.ucsd.edu/~kbranson/stopchocolateslavery/"><a href="http://vision.ucsd.edu/%7Ekbranson/stopchocolateslavery/">http://vision.ucsd.edu/~kbranson/stopchocolateslavery/</a></a><br><br>There&#39;s a link. It&#39;ll take you to a site where they have legitimate news articles about this, ways to stop it, ways to avoid it, and other useful information. I&#39;ll say it again: IT DOESN&#39;T HAVE TO BE THIS WAY.<br><br>I know it doesn&#39;t always seem like it, but chocolate is a luxury. We don&#39;t -need- it to survive, not at the cost of the freedom of our brothers and sisters across the ocean. And even if we do? There are solutions. I mentioned Green &amp; Black&#39;s, earlier-- they buy fair-trade, certified chocolate which only comes from small farmers who are given a fair price for their cacao beans. I&#39;ve heard a lot of people complain about how fair-trade stuff is always more expensive-- but as I said, it&#39;s a luxury, and as for me personally? I&#39;d rather pay a little more or go without than eat something I know has bathed in the blood, sweat, and tears of some poor kid who&#39;s been chained to this travesty against his will.</p>

            <p>Is this one going to crop up every time a chocolate related holiday rolls round? I&#39;ll throw in a disclaimer now, saying I&#39;m drunk, and so anything that may look offensive is just poor phrasing on my part, and please don&#39;t take it to heart, but...<br><br>I won&#39;t try to deny that some workers are forced to contend with appalling conditions. I won&#39;t try to deny that the western world is all too happy to shit all over other people for cheap commodities. But I have a couple of problems with your post nonetheless.<br><br>The first is the guilt issue: the suggestion is that it is our fault, each and every one of us, that some people live in appalling conditions and work in the same, and that the west benefits. We&#39;re not individually responsible. We may, some of us, buy into a system that has, over decades, led to this situation, but personal responsibility and guilt for this cannot be laid on the shoulders of any one of us. The suggestion that it can not only gets my back up, but also suggests a lack of understanding of the many and varied factors over a lengthy period of time that have led to the situation you object to. Your post may not deliberately suggest this; I suggest altering the wording somewhat to make it less of a personal laying of blame.<br><br>The second problem is the assumption that we each of us wilfully buy cheap chocolate. Perhaps you live in such circumstances that you can decide which of a variety of brands and prices to opt for. Some of us are not so lucky. Some of us exist on a daily income well below that considered necessary by the wossnames (UN? my memory fails when drinking). Some of us don&#39;t have the option of spending two quid on a bar of chocolate when we can get the same for twenty pence. Poverty doesn&#39;t only exist in the third world. While I realise western poverty is nothing compared to that experienced in the third world, these things are, to some degree relative: it&#39;s fine for you to advocate buying fair trade, but fair trade costs money some of us simply do not have.<br><br>Ansela would like me to add that chocolate is not necessarily a luxury. If anyone can add any Science to the whys and wherefores here, I&#39;d be glad to hear it, but chocolate&#39;s about the only thing stopping her killing the three of us once a month. Is it, perchance, the same sort of luxury as tampons?</p>

            <p>It just makes me angry. <br><br>Because it&#39;s not just appalling work conditions. It&#39;s <i>slavery</i>. Like, as in, thirteen year old boys kidnapped and sold to a plantation where they are beaten and worked to death without pay and chained up at night to keep them from escaping. That&#39;s not just appalling conditions, that&#39;s slavery, a practice outlawed in most of the Western world (all, actually, to my admittedly little knowledge).<br><br>I don&#39;t blame people for the condition of Africa, nor Asia, nor the workers who make them up. I blame the corrupt governments of those countries, and I blame the corporations propping them up because cheap labor makes the economy go &#39;round. But honestly, I don&#39;t understand how buying something you don&#39;t need (yes, I know, some people do, endomorphins, etc, but the fact is the more expensive stuff is a higher percent cocoa most of the time, which means it&#39;s actually -better- for those scientific purposes than the cheap stuff, which is usually less than fifty percent cocoa and thus virtually useless where antioxidants and endomorphins are concerned), fully knowing that the product was made with unwilling slave labor, is... I don&#39;t know. There are a lot of words I want to put there, none that won&#39;t offend you (and several other people). I know I was harsher in that post than I needed to be; I should&#39;ve glanced over it before putting it up here, as it was cross-posted from another forum (where, by the way, it was utterly ignored. so you&#39;re not alone in being irritated with my constant activist shite). Anyway. Yes, I meant there to be a guilt issue. There should be. On that, I won&#39;t back down. But you&#39;re right in that it shouldn&#39;t have been that aggressive.<br><br>As for your second problem? Yeah, like I said, if it&#39;s a medical issue the fair-trade organic stuff is better for any purpose. Hershey&#39;s and their ilk are generally a very tiny percent cocoa-- if you look at the ingredients, it usually goes &quot;sugar, milk, etc,&quot; and then chocolate&#39;ll be somewhere near the end. For dietary purposes alone you&#39;re better off buying the good stuff. Chocolate&#39;s not medically necessary for me, though, so maybe I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m talking about. <br><br>But I do take offense (kind of-- I am bearing in mind that you&#39;re drunk, and trying not to take it personally) to you implying that I can afford to buy luxury chocolate all the time, or whatever. I currently work two jobs, don&#39;t get enough hours at either, can&#39;t afford to drive or go to college or do much more than eat (most of the time) and pay a few of my dad&#39;s bills. And this is going to sound self-righteous, but if it&#39;s a choice between fair-trade and nothing, I just don&#39;t buy it. To me, it&#39;s not worth the guilt trip. Because even though I complain about my life all the time, the chocolate isn&#39;t worth making someone else&#39;s life that much worse. <br><br>And actually I don&#39;t wear tampons either. <s>Though that&#39;s actually just because they bug me.</s></p>

            <p>It is completely impossible to tell what comes from where, because all the cocoa is mixed together by the time it reaches the consumer.

            <p>I know there&#39;s been buzz here about &quot;Avatar&quot; (which I&#39;ve still been meaning to see), but I&#39;d like to turn the attention a bit to an upcoming summer movie based on a certain cartoon series. In other words, &quot;The Last Airbender&quot;, based on &quot;Avatar: The Last Airbender&quot;. <br><br>I&#39;m a minor fan of the series (I&#39;ve only seen each episode once), but I&#39;m quite interested in this movie and how the sequels will turn out. Yes, I know there have been wars on the fan websites because of the actors chosen, but my point isn&#39;t to discuss that. I want to know what the major fanatics think of the upcoming movie. (I&#39;m quite surprised that this hasn&#39;t been brought up sooner, actually.)<br><br>The full-length trailer was finally released, so <a href="http://avatar.wikia.com/wiki/User_blog:The_888th_Avatar/Full_theatrical_trailer_released_online"> here </a> is the link.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m a bit miffed at the costume department for not keeping the color coding, and Katara in the trailer sounds a bit too much like Sandra Bullock <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdRl8OQZYw4">in <i>Prince of Egypt</i></a> for my tastes, but I&#39;m definitely seeing this, almost certainly in theaters.<br><br>I fully expect to be disappointed about the casting of Toph for the next one, but I&#39;ve been wrong about that sort of thing before; see: Evanna Lynch.</p>

            <p>I actually really, really love that show, and have for a very long time-- since the first season, actually. (Or &#39;book,&#39; I guess.) And honestly, I think Shyamalan might be the perfect director for the job. He&#39;s made some bad films in the past, but he was good before them-- and this movie is kind of his style, I think?<br><br>Anyway, I think Sokka looks exactly as he should, and Katara sounds exactly as she should, and I absolutely love what they did with Aang&#39;s tattoos. <br><br>So yeah.

Hope you stay with us for a while and enjoy yourself while you do.<br><br>--anamia<br>p.s. I would advise against reading the legendary badfic. I suppose if you can somehow manage to see the humour in them it&#39;s fine, but they tend to be worse than they sound, and they sound bad. At least, to me they do. Then again, I have issues with graphic smut, so it may be easier for you, depending on your level of tolerance. Good luck if you do choose to read them!</p>

            <p>Thanks, everyone! It&#39;s nice to meet you all!<br><br>Thank you especially for the links- I&#39;ve almost finished reading all of the original stories, but the badfics look wonderfully entertaining in a masochistic sort of way.

            <p>I comes bearing links. *drags out Big Bag O&#39; Links and digs through it*<br><br>First off is the link to the <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/PPC_Wiki">Wiki</a>, a veritable fount of information for a newbie to read through. Especially helpful for you if you want to write missions would be the page on <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Permission">Permission</a> (note the capital P).<br><br>I would advise against reading any <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Legendary_badfic">Legendary Badfic</a>, unless you are of strong mind and stomach. Even the summaries have been known to give those of weaker constitution nightmares.<br><br>For your reading pleasure, not knowing what you have already managed to find, I have several links for you. <a href="http://www.misssandman.com/PPC/story.html">The Original Series</a> (not to be confused with Star Trek) is a good place to start, as the PPC did many aeons ago. <s>What do you mean I&#39;m exaggerating?</s> <a href="http://www.freewebs.com/bonsaimallorn/">The Department of Geographical Aberrations</a> is another interesting place to visit, if you have the time and inclination. Also by hS is the <a href="http://www.freewebs.com/ppchistory/index.htm">Tangled Webs</a> site, which contains backstory for the PPC as an organisation. If you would rather visit the Floaters, then <a href="http://julyppc.webs.com/">July&#39;s site</a> is the place you need to be. And last, but most definitely not least, <a href="http://rc45.dreamwidth.org/">Response Centre 45</a> is where Trojie and Pads&#39; missions are archived.<br><br>Hope you enjoy your stay here.
