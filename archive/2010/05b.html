            <p>The situation is like so: an agent has witnessed an immense trauma, namely her (former) partner running off in a truly <i>painful</i> fic to play the role of Lucius Malfoy&#39;s concubine. Said agent (not the partner, the other one) has thus been given Bleepulan ale to erase the memories while the Flowers that be try to find the fic again and track down the partner. For obvious reasons, the agent has now been assigned a new partner, who has just transferred from DIC to DBS. Approximately how long would it take for my poor agent to become functional once again, would giving her Holy Hangover Cure help any, and just how bad does she have to be to cause the Flowers to send her back into the fic to capture her partner and finish the exorcism?<br><br>--anamia</p>

            <p>I&#39;m not sure about the Bleepulan Ale bit, but I&#39;m pretty sure if an agent went rogue in the manner you described (being seduced by a Replacement!Stu, I guess) the Flowers would send her back in immediately no drinking and no waiting. You can&#39;t lose a story with a Stu that bad pus a brainwashed agent.</p>

            <p>I humbly request permission to be allowed to write for the PPC.<br><br><u>Agent Danny Richardson</u> <br>Age: 25<br>Home Continuum: World One<br>Species: Human<br>Height: 6’ 2”<br>Hair: Blond<br>Eyes: Brown<br>Weapon Preference: Swords<br>About: Danny&#39;s a literati through and through. He loves nothing more than to find somewhere nice and private with novels thick enough to crack nuts with, so its a bit odd that he&#39;s ended up in the Video Game Division of the Department of Mary Sues. He&#39;s collected and disciplined, and prefers to go in to a situation with a plan already laid out. He&#39;s not above a little good natured ribbing now and then, particularly with his quick-to-anger partner. His clothing usually consists of a black cardigan over a shirt-and-tie ensemble. The one thing that REALLY breaks Danny&#39;s calm is poor spelling and grammar. Do not mix up &quot;your&quot; and &quot;you&#39;re&quot; around him. We&#39;re talking <i>heavy</i> violence.<br><br><u>Agent Laura Dukes</u><br>Age: 22<br>Species: Human<br>Home Continuum: World One<br>Height: 5’ 10”<br>Hair: Red<br>Eyes: Blue<br>Weapon Preference: Daggers<br>About: Laura&#39;s a surly troublemaker with a passion for video games, particularly FPSs and RPGs. Her attitude has been described by some as &#39;aggressive&#39; and by the rest as &#39;somewhat caustic;&#39; she&#39;s been known to scream and curse at those who get on her bad side. Sometimes even those on her good side. She tends to operate on twitch reflexes, which can result in her leaping in and winging it much of the time (much to the distress of her superiors). Laura loves a good practical joke, provided she&#39;s not on the receiving end. She dresses casually: long sleeved shirt and jeans most of the time. <br><br>A sample pre-mission vignette staring my agents is at <a href="http://vgdivision.livejournal.com/582.html#cutid1/"><a href="http://vgdivision.livejournal.com/582.html#cutid1/">http://vgdivision.livejournal.com/582.html#cutid1/</a></a>.

            <p>Your agents seem to be fun. You might want to think about doing a mission in the Myst continuum, if you know anything about it. Seems like the kind of game Danny would love, and it would give your agents a bit more friction.</p>

Before I expose it to the world, I&#39;d love for someone to go over it to check for basic mispellings, gramatical issues, PPCishness, etc. (A permantent beta would also be lovely, if anyone is interested/has the time.)<br><br>I can be found via AIM at anamia8742, or by email at thirteenskater(@)gmail(.)com. AIM is probably the better option, as I don&#39;t check my email nearly as often as I should.<br><br>Oh, and since I suspect you&#39;ll want to know: the fandom is Harry Potter, the Department is DBS, and the fic in question is NSFB. Not that that matters too much for the mission, but I thought I&#39;d warn you.<br><br>Thanks!<br>--anamia</p>

            <p>I&#39;d be happy to give you a hand with it; might be best if we talk it over in private, though, instead of discussing it all over the Board. You can contact me on cassie.dramateacherATgooglemail.com, if you&#39;d like to discuss it. Betas aren&#39;t that scary, we&#39;re really not. :P</p>

            <p>I never read Black Stallion myself, but I can tell it&#39;s one of those childhood things that was never meant to be subjected to the bad fan fiction treatment.  Also, that was some nasty, nasty grammer, so I&#39;m impressed you put yourself through that.</p>

            <p>Hello! I&#39;m a newbie here (obviously), but have highly enjoyed reading the various missions that&#39;ve been posted on the wiki. Eventually, I&#39;d like to write my own missions, purely because there is so much bad!fic and not as many Agents. My main fandoms are SGA and Leverage, though I&#39;ve dabbled in a few others over my time.

            <p>I&#39;ve already seen a couple of Canon!Relative-sues in Leverage, so that should provide fodder for a few missions. The problem is, since the main characters are a) thieves and b) work in a tight-knit group, it might be hard for PPC agents to infiltrate said group and take care of the Sues. &lt;br&gt;<br>SGA, on the other hand, should be easy enough.</p>

            <p>I hereby request permission. Agent profiles are as follows:<br><u>Agent Somariel</u><br>Appearance: Somariel is about 5&#39;7&quot;, with long red-blonde hair normally worn in a ponytail. She has greenish hazel eyes that are usually seen behind a pair of glasses. She&#39;s most often seen wearing dark jeans and a comfy T-shirt, possibly with her favorite sweatshirt. Around the response center, she&#39;s usually found wearing slippers, which are changed for sneakers when she has to leave the RC.<br>Personality: Somariel tends to be a rather quiet person, only entering ongoing conversations if she feels she has something useful to contribute. In spite of this, she will sometimes come out with some completely random thought she just had. A confirmed introvert, she finds being around other people for extended periods of time to be tiring and generally needs a few hours of &quot;alone time&quot; every day to stay sane. As a result of Aspberger&#39;s Syndrome, she has trouble reading social cues. She&#39;s a voracious reader and a good artist, although she can honestly still see lots of room for improvement in her artwork.<br><br><u>Agent Mira</u><br>Appearance: Mira is 5&#39;4&quot;, with shoulder-length black hair. She has blue-grey eyes that darken when she is angry. She prefers leather armor over any other type of clothing and is rarely seen without her sword and a pair of knives in arm sheaths.<br>Personality: As an extrovert, Mira tends to assume that quiet people are just being shy and simply need to be drawn out of their shell, something that annoys Somariel to no end. Mira is very bubbly, although three years with the PPC has turned her from an optimist into a cynic.<br><br>A writing sample can be found here: <a href="http://somariel.livejournal.com/2225.html"></a><a href="http://somariel.livejournal.com/2225.html"><a href="http://somariel.livejournal.com/2225.html">http://somariel.livejournal.com/2225.html</a></a>. I also have a much longer, non-PPC piece of writing saved to my computer that can be uploaded to Google Docs if needed.</p>

            <p>Somariel is going to make an interesting agent. This may be difficult, but I hope you find lots of ways to play up the health issues for humor.

            <p>You&#39;ll get some interesting possibilities out of having an introvert and an extrovert working together--at best, they&#39;ll cover each others&#39; weaknesses; at worst, get on each others&#39; nerves.

            <p>In a mission that Lycaenion and I are writing, one of our Agents gets clawed by a Sue. It&#39;s a Discworld fic, the Sue is a &quot;werecat&quot; (half werewolf, half cat) and Changed at the time. It&#39;s been suggested in canon that the bite of a full werewolf <i>can</i> infect the victim, but we&#39;re uncertain if scratches would a) work the same way, and b) work at all.<br><br>If it <i>would</i> cause infection, is it likely that Medical could prevent it from actually taking hold (the Agent would be going straight to Medical as soon as she recognised the danger), or would the Agent simply have to work out a way to deal with their new problem?</p>

            <p>A mix between a cat and a wolf? That must look all kinds of oddness when it&#39;s transformed.

            <p>I can&#39;t help you with figuring out if it would be canonical, but, even if you decide to infect your agent, I got in ahead of you.

            <p>Discworld canon has Angua, a very responsible and vegetarian werewolf, wandering around Ankh-Morpork and having a job involving a lot of contact with the public, never wearing gloves. It doesn&#39;t seem she&#39;s at all worried about the consequences of accidental scratching. So I&#39;d guess scratches aren&#39;t really going to do it on the Disc.</p>

            <p>Claws are a cat&#39;s primary weapon, just like a wolf&#39;s teeth are. (Cats will still bite if they&#39;re declawed or they&#39;re actually wrestling with or being pinned down by their opponent.) Also, a cat&#39;s claws can be sheathed, unlike a dog&#39;s; so it would not run the risk of casual contact turning others into were-cats. Being clawed by a were-cat may be equivalent to being bitten by a were-wolf in that sense, so I think it can be justified either way. Discworld is very much driven by the power of stories, anyway.<br><br>It might be significant whether or not this particular sue&#39;s were-cat status is magical or virus-like; a virus-like transmission would make more sense if there were were-cat saliva making contact with your Agent&#39;s blood; but a magical transmission might only require the were-cat to injure their victim for transmission.</p>

            <p>I don&#39;t think you can say being scratched is the same thing as being bitten, no matter what animal is doing it. Having lived with cats most of my life, I can attest that I&#39;ve mostly been scratched by accident, generally by way of an escape attempt, and that cats definitely prefer biting over scratching when they mean business. The front claws are there mostly to hold on, not attack. They will use their back claws in an attempt to disembowel prey/enemies, but that&#39;s only if they get a grip with teeth and front claws first, and fur (and clothing) serves as a pretty good defense against that move.<br><br>As for cats fighting each other, it&#39;s basically the same. They bat at each other, but that&#39;s only until they can get close enough to bite--unless the other cat runs away first, which is really what everybody wants. All the hissing and spitting and flailing a cat does in a fight is a show of force, an attempt to end the fight before it gets serious enough for biting. The bite is the more serious weapon.<br><br>HOWEVER, if we are dealing with an infectious agent, a cat&#39;s claws would be far more likely than a wolf&#39;s to transmit it. Nothing to do with claws being a cat&#39;s main weapon, which they&#39;re not, but cats get all kinds of nastiness trapped under their claws--there&#39;s a little groove running along the underside, much like the space under our nails. Dirt gets trapped under there, and so does cat saliva when they clean themselves. Also, cat claws are naturally sharper than canine claws, so they&#39;re more likely to draw blood when used, exposing the victim to the infectious agent. That&#39;s why there&#39;s such a thing as cat-scratch fever, but no dog-scratch fever.<br><br>But that&#39;s if it is a viral agent, of course. On the Disc, it may be some combination of viral and magical, like a viral curse or something. *shrug* As for the power of story, most of the ones I&#39;ve heard of specify a bite being the vector, if they specify anything at all.<br><br>... That&#39;s a lot of text. I think I&#39;m done now. ^_^;<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>If the infection is carried by saliva, that would allow both biting and scratching to transmit it. Does the original fic ever say anything about transmission? That might give you some answers, though I guess you probably wouldn&#39;t have asked if it was mentioned.</p>

            <p>Well, if you <i>wanted</i> to give your agent a new and potentially comical trait, you certainly could, but otherwise... <br><br>I&#39;m quite sure Medical could deal with any infection, and regardless of whether it&#39;s sure to transmit the curse, any sensible agent would probably go there for some sort of disinfecting agent anyway...

            <p>Is it a charge to write fanfiction for stories by authors who&#39;ve said they don&#39;t like it? I&#39;m thinking of people like Diana Gabaldon, Anne Rice, and Robin Hobb, among others. How serious a charge would it be?

            <p>That Pern mission didn&#39;t even get finished (sort of) for something like three years, as I recall, so that was WELL after the ban was lifted. Can&#39;t say the same for the badfic, though. The mission in question is <a href="http://www.freewebs.com/bonsaimallorn3/BrownPart1.htm">Brown DragonRider of Pern</a>.

            <p>Why tickle a sleeping dragon? Best to leave them be.

            <p>I just thought of this; tell me if it makes sense?<br><br>An Author is practically omnipotent in relation to his own world; and no mary-sue or author wraith can ever match up to that level of power. Even the most omnipotent of god-mode Sues can&#39;t match the creativity of the omnipotent Author; so the Author can always overpower any Sues--if he chooses to do so by blocking off his world entirely from both good and bad.<br><br>Therefore, it might be that an Author who has chosen to block all fanfiction from his world&#39;s canon may have effectively set up a two-way creativity shield around the canon, stopping anyone from getting in or out--Agent and Sue alike. An author who blocks his continuum would force any fan author who wants to write fanfiction anyway to create an entirely new world for it which is quite unconnected to--and thus can&#39;t hurt--the original canon. PPCing it wouldn&#39;t make much sense because that effect puts it in the same existential category as original fiction.<br><br>That&#39;s not to say that blocking all fanfiction is the obvious choice. An open world is not just needlessly vulnerable to warping by badfic; it can also be strengthened and made more detailed when good fanfiction is written in that world. An Author who allows fanfiction is taking the gamble that the good will outweigh the bad.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m trying to fix my bad case of Webcomic Time with my agents by doing something set after the Macrovirus invasion, as their current fic time is stuck around late 2007. However, Foxglove lost an eye in the battle for HQ just after the invasion. Can Medical actually rebuild eyeballs, or would she be stuck with a fake one? I know they weren&#39;t able to rebuild Ithalond&#39;s hands, and the eye was too badly mangled to simply stick back in, but is there a canon from which they could take eyeball-rebuilding or transplanting tech (e.g. Discworld&#39;s Igors)? Or is there a canon where they could get cybertronic or magical eyeballs which work better than real ones (e.g. Moody&#39;s magical eye), and if so, would they work outside their home continuum?</p>

            <p>...I&#39;m not really coming up with a lot.  I know of several canons where eyes, magical or not, can be transplanted from one person to another, and I know of at least one dimension-hopping character who should be capable of creating artificial eyes (seeing as she at one point creates a fake arm that can bleed and, for some odd reason, grab ghosts), but I can&#39;t really think of any where there&#39;s a standardized magical eye replacement.<br><br>The fun thing about the PPC, though, is how easy it is to justify whatever type of plot device you want.  Not only are there millions of canons Medical can steal from, but HQ isn&#39;t exactly lacking in the mad scientist department.  Making up some sort of magically powered replacement is not out of the question.<br><br>In terms of technological-based replacements, though, my favorites are still the prosthetics used in Ghost in the Shell (specifically in the character Batou).  They look sort of like camera lenses embedded in the eye socket and function the same way, identifying, isolating and zooming in on points of interest (such as weapons or writing) in a scene as the user observes them.  Of course, they also might require having a computer installed in the user&#39;s brain to work properly...</p>

            <p>She&#39;d want one which did something other than just what a regular eyeball does, but I&#39;m trying to think of functions which would be actually useful. Nightvision could work for missions at night, but then her partner hasn&#39;t got nightvision so they&#39;d still need a torch or something. X-ray vision wouldn&#39;t be much good because half the time the characters they&#39;re watching wind up naked anyway.</p>

            <p>...on what Foxglove&#39;s definition of useful is.  If she&#39;s the sort who would want her new eye to actually be helpful on missions, then maybe some kind of CAD variation that can identify Sues and such (though that might be tricky, seeing as CADs blow up a lot and exploding eyeballs = bad).  Or that translates Fangirl into English.  Or that can just see a long ways away.<br><br>On the other hand, if her idea of useful pretty much equals cool, there&#39;s a whole different set of functions available.  An eye that can take pictures and play movies and shoot laserbeams and identify whether an outfit is stylish or not may not be much practical use, but could be, ah, entertaining.<br><br>And then there&#39;s the issue that anything she got would only be limited to one eye.</p>

            <p>On further thought, the eyeball would have to fit in the socket with no frames or protrusions onto her face, because elaborate cybernetics would be sort of out of place in most of the continua she works. That, and she&#39;s still in contact with her family, and they&#39;d notice anything too elaborate - a funny-coloured magic or tech eyeball could be passed off as a contact lens, but weird Borg stuff couldn&#39;t.</p>

            <p>Would, say, something along the lines of Moody&#39;s magical eyeball work outside the HP continuum? I ask because Foxglove&#39;s primary fandoms are magic-based, not tech-based, so it makes sense to explore magical options as well, if that&#39;s possible.</p>

            <p>Umbridge uses it as one of those little peephole thingies that you stick onto doors, so it&#39;s magical power is internal, not supplied by Mad-eye himself, and there doesn&#39;t seem to be any other reason why it wouldn&#39;t work outside of the Potterverse. A copy could be made fairly easily. In fact, since Harry buried it, Foxglove could get the original...although why in nine hells she would want to is not my guess to make. </p>

            <p>Apart from the fact that it&#39;d probably count as desecration of canon to steal it, all it really does is X-ray vision, and half the time the characters in L&amp;F&#39;s missions end up naked anyway so it would be kind of pointless ;P So perhaps something similar, which does something more useful to a PPCer ... dunno what.<br><br>I ask because agents can cast at least some spells in the Potterverse if they use witch or wizard disguises, but if they don&#39;t come from the Potterverse they can&#39;t cast spells in HQ.

            <p>One of the sarcophagus in Stargate SG-1 should do the trick to heal the existing eye.  Someone mentioned another method causing addiction problems, and the sarcophagus does also, but only over long time exposure-like daily for a few weeks.  Initial personality changes after perhaps a week.<br><br><a href="http://stargate.wikia.com/wiki/Sarcophagus"><a href="http://stargate.wikia.com/wiki/Sarcophagus">http://stargate.wikia.com/wiki/Sarcophagus</a></a><br><br>Anyway, the character is placed inside, the lid is closed and it heals everything, even the recently deceased.

            <p>Geordi says outright (in <i>Insurrection</i>) that he&#39;s never before seen a sunrise - &quot;at least, not the way you see it&quot; - which means that Trek-cyber-eyes&#39; vision is still limited to what can be detected electromagnetically. But if your agent only has one eye replaced, not two, then they&#39;d have the benefit of one super-eye and still able to see things normally in the other (I suspect that the loopiness of bad writing, plotholes and so on could well play havoc with electronic eyes, as they do CADs - it might also be that such cybereyes can&#39;t see Words and such as well as normal eyes, but that&#39;s pure speculation).</p>

            <p>In the Cowboy Bebop anime, I believe the character Spike has a replacement eyeball. Other than an ever-so-slight difference in eye color, it&#39;s barely noticeable.

            <p>The most sure-fire way would be to let Foxglove use the morphing cube from Animorphs, turn into an animal, then turn back.  This would &quot;reset&quot; her body to whatever her DNA coded for, including fully-functioning eyes.  However, I suspect you don&#39;t want to turn your agent into an Animorph...<br><br>The other thing I thought of is the mana infusion chamber from Magic: the Gathering.  One particular character used the chamber to patch up his body whenever he got injured, but it carried the side-effect of addicting him to black mana.  That wouldn&#39;t be a problem for Foxglove if she only used it once, of course.<br><br>I guess the problem with these ideas is that Foxglove would get her ownn eye back, rather than a fancy sci-fi one!</p>

            <p>The Star Wars novel <u>Vision of the Future</u> mentions replacement eyes briefly, so I&#39;d imagine Medical could get their hands on whatever is used in the Star Wars continuum. The book is rather vague as to the exact process, so you could probably write it however you want. One of the characters has an eyepatch and when he&#39;s asked about it, he says, &quot;Our medical replacement facilities are limited, and I opted to forgo a new eye in favor of others of my pilots who might need the operation.&quot;</p>

            <p>I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a real transplant actually. I just remembered that there&#39;s at least one other canonical eye replacement and that one is a cybernetic eye. From what I&#39;ve been able to gather from the descriptions of it in the books, it&#39;s an implant fits in the eye socket, but the surface looks like a red screen instead of the usually pupil-iris-white appearance.</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve had my eye on a particularly atrocious fancomic for some time now.  It follows the same basic lines as bad fanfic: contrived romances, disturbing acts of violence, using a miscarriage for cheap drama, Did Not Do The Research, and a mind-boggling amount of spelling errors.  Does it count as bad fanfic, or does the PPC stay away from fancomics?</p>

            <p>I don&#39;t think the question has ever come up before. Is it a fancomic of an existing, &#39;published&#39; story, or is it essentially original, no matter how bad? If the former, you could probably PPC it, though the &#39;how&#39; might be tricky, but if the latter, and it&#39;s just a rubbish story, no. <br><br>I would advise against it, though, unless you plan to write your PPC mission as a comic itself; changing medium is rather difficult for such a complex parody as this.</p>

            <p>My guess is that the PPC probably handles badfic in any format, but because most fics are written in prose story form, most missions are to normal fanfic. In addition, written stories are (obviously) not the only media the PPC protects; there are also TV shows, movies, musicals/plays, and anime/manga.<br><br>(In case you&#39;ve never had the pleasure, Sonichu is a very, very bad fan comic. That it&#39;s listed means it&#39;s probably up for PPCing if someone is brave or stupid enough. Or maybe someone&#39;s already claimed it, I don&#39;t know; point being, though, it&#39;s up there and it&#39;s a fan comic.)<br><br>Might be an interesting challenge to PPC a comic; a lot of the usual missions deal with messed-up wording and how it expresses itself, but with a fancomic, you&#39;d have bad art to worry about too. Disguising the agents might be interesting; with particularly bad art you might end up seriously deformed or even outright two-dimensional. Ever read &quot;Flatland&quot;?<br><br>Anyway, sounds interesting. I don&#39;t have too much experience to tell, but I think it&#39;d be possible.</p>

            <p>PPC mission reports don&#39;t have to be in the form of text; they just traditionally are. I think you might run into some issues if you used the original art, though; you&#39;d probably just have to link to it and/or re-draw events in a similar style.<br><br>Personally, I&#39;ve toyed with the idea of PPCing a horribly-written Sims 2 story by creating Sim versions of agents to use as disguises. The game has a built-in &quot;camera&quot;, and quite a lot of people use it to write very good stories; but there&#39;s some pretty horrible writing/picture-taking out there. Plus... Cowplants. Just cowplants. If you&#39;ve never wanted to feed a Sue to one of &#39;em, you&#39;ve never played Sims.</p>

            <p>For example, deliberately overloading a CAD and having it explode might cause damage (a la exploding tricorder, but the DoSAT&#39;s gonna hate you more). Mixing Bleeprin and Pink/Purple Stuff causes an explosion and can probably be used as a makeshift Molotov cocktail (Bleeprin is not canon in HPverse).

            <p>From what I understand, the PPC takes just about <i>everything </i> from other continua. After all, who needs to make something if it&#39;s already made for you? All you need to do is find somone who has what you want, take it from them, wipe their memories (with another stolen device) and run away. My assumption is that nothing is actually made by the PPC, just stolen and modified.<br><br>Just my thoughts on the subject.</p>

            <p>Well, it ain&#39;t the greatest thing the Pit has churned out, but...it isn&#39;t nearly as bad as the reviewers are insisting. Actually, most of them think it&#39;s pretty good, except for AJW, who doesn&#39;t have an account and who therefore should be distrusted instinctively, and hitherehi62, who is the <i>same person</i> as AJW and only joined so they could flame people without getting deleted. And the author is being very polite and good-natured about the whole thing, suprisingly enough, and though they admit they wrote it in a rush, they don&#39;t use it to excuse their mistakes. <br><br>Okay okay okay. Long story short: in my opinion, not badfic. Not exactly goodfic either, but this author needs a beta, not a spork to the eye or trollflames up the nose.  </p>

            <p>I thought every PPC&#39;er took what they learned here and applied it to their old works.  After all, with our own stories, we HAVE the power to change them, unlike with the Suethors.  With them, all we can do is hint.  Strongly.  Several times, and with sporks.</p>

            <p>...&#39;Cause this show is probably the best thing to come to Cartoon  Network since the original Ben 10 (it was made by the same guys, so that shouldn&#39;t be much of a surprise), and I&#39;d hate to see it fall to badifc like pretty much ever other series out there. <br><br>(Also, if... when...

            <p>This is something that has been bugging me for a while. What is the line between concrit and flaming? I take concrit to be something that shows flaws in your writing but offers to help fix them or some sort of advice, and flames to be insulting/being rude about the author. But there is a grey area between the two.]<br><br>For example, where would a review saying &#39;You can&#39;t write, all your characters are Sues and you deserve to die&#39;, but linking to a place detailing what Mary-Sues are and how to fix them, fall? It&#39;s unnecessarily mean but it does link to a help site.<br><br>Just something I&#39;ve been thinking about for a while. I&#39;ll be interested to see what you say.</p>

            <p>That&#39;s a flame. From my perspective, it&#39;s all to do with the attitude of the message and how it&#39;s meant to make you feel.

Instead of saying &quot;Your main character is a classic Sue and your writing needs work,&quot; you can say &quot;I can&#39;t relate to your main character because of traits A, B, and C, and it would be much easier for me to follow the story if it were spell-checked and had better paragraphing. By the way, here&#39;s a website explaining how paragraphs work.&quot;<br><br>This approach runs the risk of making it easy for them to brush your comments off as a personal problem, but the kind of person who does that probably wouldn&#39;t respond positively to concrit in any form. Anyway, that way you avoid seeming to accuse people of anything, and it can help keep them from immediately getting defensive. Not always, of course, but sometimes.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>If you have to use a pronoun, it&#39;s better to use &quot;I&quot;. But it can be a little awkward, and if it is awkward then it&#39;s obvious you&#39;re using it, which defeats the purpose because it sounds like you&#39;re patronizing them...<br><br>Better to stay away from pronouns in general, I think. Talking about the story without either &quot;you&quot; or &quot;I&quot; seems to work best for me.</p>

            <p>So, for me, your example would be a flame. Yes, it links to a help site, but its main purpose is to hurt the author.

            <p>So, this must be the place where we deal with the blight of fan works. I want to write my own mission since badfics can give me headaches and sometime, groans and wearing out my sanity. My main fandoms are Gundam, videos games, and a few others. I also thought up a few agents, one of them is a robot from Superior Defender Gundam Force. You can contact me anytime, I&#39;m in no hurry.<br><br>-Sneezier</p>

            <p>The gift in a form of an idea.<br><br>If the mary sue or gary stu visit the beauty salon or a barber shop, it is a perfect opportunity to list the charges and go for the kill. The agent can disguise themselves as hairstylists or barbers.<br><br>-For Mary Sues: Give them hair treatments such as rearranging their hair style. If you want, you can do something really bad to the hair such as cutting of their hair while listing the charges for better effect, total humiliation for the sue. If the humiliation is so deep, the sue begs to die so use any method to kill her. The alternative is giving them the shampoo treatment. You can use restraints to prevent the sue from escaping. List the charges. Flood the sink so she can drown or electrocute them to death.<br>-For Gary Stus: Give them a haircut or something depending on the Stu&#39;s request. You can choke them with anything in the shop and list the charges before they die from strangulation. Another is the giving the dude a shave. First use the headlock, next is to list the charges, and finally, slit the throat with the razor.(*Pretty Women song not recommended, Bond One Liner optional.)<br></p>

            <p>The question to ask, though, is: would it be funny? In most cases, something like a mech (or a TARDIS or a Sun Crusher) would be too ostentatious to be useful to a stealth-dependent PPC Agent, but if you can find a way to make it work for humor in a mission, it&#39;s totally possible.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>...I can do something funny with them.<br><br>-The agent is goofing around in the mecha. <br>-If mecha has a chameleon circuit any related stealth device, it tends to be faulty. This leads to amusing situations like shifting from the classic Zaku II to the modern Sutherland.<br>-Ejection systems can go off at unexpected times.<br>-They can fall apart.<br>-Thrusters can short out in mid-flight then crash.<br>-The auto-pilot can be uncooperative. <br></p>

            <p>Before I could do my duties, I need some opinion and criticisms on my agents.<br><br>Agent Joseph Trevor <br>Age: 19<br>Home Continuum: World One<br>Species: Human<br>Height: 5’ 6”<br>Hair: Black<br>Eyes: Green<br>Weapon Preference: Wrenches, Sentries (Turrets), Traps<br>About: Joseph is a calm and collected person with a passion for engineering but due to a paperwork blunder, he&#39;s in the Department of Floaters instead of the Department of Sufficiently Advanced Technology so he stuck as an agent to assassinate Sues. With trigger happy Centurio, he has to keep him under control. Mpregs, rape, or any illegal sexual activities snaps his calm demeanor, especially if they involve his lust objects. His attire consists of a  worker shirt, goggles (*usually on his hat), a plumber&#39;s cap, a jacket, overalls, a tool belt, and boots. His loves anime and video games with a dash of certain movies.<br><br>Agent Centurio <br>Age: 3<br>Home Continuum: Superior Defender Gundam Force (Neotopia to be precise)<br>Species: Robot (Combat Mobile Citizen to be precise)<br>Height: 4&#39; 9&quot;<br>Hair: N/A<br>Eyes: Red<br>Weapon Preference: Guns, Lightsabers<br>About: A Combat Mobile Citizen from Neotopia as an early byproduct of the Zeta Project. His rather shoot first, ask questions later. A gung-ho robot who loves to collect guns. Much to chagrin to his superiors, he causes a lot of collateral damage at various continua when he&#39;s taking on a sue head on. As a result, he&#39;s not allowed to do missions until he gets a partner, Joseph. He doesn&#39;t like Joseph for being a &quot;wuss&quot; and a &quot;moral restraint&quot; but he secret depended on him to fix him. After all, his body is sturdy but he often broke into body parts and spares are hard to replace. He looks a lot like a short and stubby Hyaku Shiki from Zeta Gundam. Because he can&#39;t wear clothing, his body painted black with thin red strips on his arms and legs. The only clothing he wears is an army beret with the DF Flashpatch on it. Also, since he can&#39;t eat nor drink, he has to use special gadgetry to remove scarring mental images so Bleeperin and related medications are out of the question.</p>

            <p>They both sound pretty standard for PPC agents, with enough interesting quirks and traits to flavour your missions nicely. Nice job! <br><br>As a side note, in preparation for your Permission request, you may want to write a short non-mission piece with these two, maybe when they meet after being assigned to one another, so your Permission Giver can have a sense of how you write them personally - of course, any writing sample is fine, as the article says, but if I happen to be the PG who reads your request, I&#39;d like to see how you handle your agents in a story. <br><br>But please, please, <i>please</i>, for the love of canon, get a beta to fix your grammar. Your spelling&#39;s fine, but you have fragment sentences and tense shifts and <i>ow</i>, it hurts. (Have I mentioned I&#39;m an editor? I&#39;m afraid I don&#39;t have time to offer to beta myself, but feel free to put up a post asking for help - if you wait a little while until your posts aren&#39;t the only thing at the top of the page, you can go ahead and make a new thread for it.)<br><br>Again, I think your agents are shaping up pretty nicely; good job. :)</p>

I don&#39;t think too many continua leave large magnets lying around, but I can imagine how awkward it would be if that happened. ^_^<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>The agent in incognito suggest to a couple, usually a canon character and a sue, to a big restaurant. Alternatively, they might already go there in the fic. Once they are in their seats and dine on some food. The agent then switch their disguise as the staff, usually as waiters/waitresses and serve them. Here&#39;s some methods.<br><br>1)Poison the sue&#39;s drink, or a spike it with wierd liquid from the same Continuum for the best results.<br>2)Poisoing the food also works or put something extremely spicy in the dish.<br>3)Dropping a chandelier on the sue. (Note: Don&#39;t do this if there&#39;s civilians or canon character are under it to so check before doing this, I don&#39;t think the Flowers tolerate collateral damage to civilians or canon characters.)<br>4)Pretend you trip while serving food and &#39;accidentally&#39; hit the sue in the face. The food should contain a knife, an explosive, or anything that is concealable.<br>5)Give the sue a fake check that sum up the total, make it so high. It shocks the sue, thus inducing a fatal heart attack. (Note: Don&#39;t give it to the canon character.)<br>6) If all else fails, use a pushcart with mundane sharp objects and impale the sue.</p>

            <p>Numbers #4 and #5 might be too risky or unlikely to succeed for an agent to seriously attempt as an assassination method, but otherwise, all are perfectly viable options (though the agent would probably wait until the Sue chooses to go to a restraunt herself, rather than suggest it). Poison is a <i><b>fun</b></i> assasination method - you have excellent taste! Cheers!<br><br><br>However, as Neshomeh said above, we&#39;d appreciate it if you would please work on your grammar a bit; your very first line, for example, has tense and prepositional issues - <i>The agent in incognito suggest to a couple, usually a canon character and a sue, to a big restaurant</i><br><br>This really should be something like: <i>The agent (in disguise*) suggest<u>s</u> to a couple, usually a canon character and a sue, <u>that they go</u> to a big restaurant.</i><br>(*this could be &quot;in disguise&quot; <b>or</b> &quot;incognito&quot;, but not &quot;in incognito&quot;, as &quot;in&quot; is unnecessary)</p>

            <p>So, I was in the IRC when I came up with the idea of rewriting Lord of the Rings so that Frodo had the one sword that could defeat the robot empire or something, and this idea kind of snowballed from there. This... piece of utter fail is the first thing I&#39;ve chosen to share with the internet. By God, it&#39;s really bad. It&#39;s even worse at the beginning, which is not the way I wanted it to turn out... Just really bad all over.<br><br>(Warning, it&#39;s NSFW.

Homophobic insults are not funny. This shit doesn&#39;t fly even if you put wings and a propeller on it. <br><br>4) This is not what parody is. You could have very easily used the same idea and make something actually  funny out of it or something. This is along the lines of Disaster Movie in terms of the thought and intelligence and care put into it.<br><br>5) This is counter to what the PPC is here for. We can&#39;t be &#39;oh, we concrit when we do this because we want to improve others and ourselves as writers&#39; when we show the world that we do not give a damn for the writing process ourselves.<br><br>6) That fic would generally be called a trollfic. Trollfics are not funny or amusing or even hilarious. They&#39;re right around the same level of &#39;HEY WANT FREE PROZAC?&#39; in your email box when people are trying to find something they&#39;re actually interested in finding something.<br><br>7) You had the choice and knowledge that you didn&#39;t have to put that up for public viewing, but you did anyways, and the fact that you acknowledge it sucks means that you know full well know better. :| <br><br></p>

            <p>Ahoy, PPC! Newbie ineedbettername here. Wait, this isn&#39;t a naval setting? Pity, I wanted to practice my boarding and plundering skills.<br><br>*cough* Anyway, after reading TOS and wandering the wiki for a little bit (read: half an hour), I posted a badfic in the &#39;unclaimed&#39; section and decided to join when SO mentioned it to me. I hope to have a long and prosperous career here at the PPC.<br><br>My question is thus: Does anyone here know an alternate site for Trojie and Paddlebrains&#39; missions? I tried accessing them on the Livejournal links provided, but I received an HTTP 403 (forbidden) error.</p>

I guess it&#39;s not as well-known as I thought, though I guess it is in the &quot;Juvenile&quot; section of my library (I read and enjoyed it a long time ago, but it has lost some of its charm since then, even for me).</p>

            <p>I&#39;ll third the anti-correcting based on country of origin.<br><br>I don&#39;t know if this makes sense, but when reading fanfic, I have always read with the expectation of seeing British terms in shows of British origin (including spelling), and American terms in shows of American origin (including spelling).<br><br>So, it drives me crazy when I read NCIS or Stargate (okay, it is produced in Canada, but it is based in the US), and a character says something like, &quot;I turned on my torch, because it was dark.&quot; or &quot;Rodney loved blue jelly from the cafeteria.&quot; <br><br>None of the American characters would ever call a flashlight a torch, or Jello jelly.  To me it is a particularly annoying, jar-me-out-of-the-story OOC moment.  But the opposite is true if I am reading something like Dr. Who.  <br><br>If we do end up having to pick, would it be reasonable to base it on the standard established by the origin of the canon?  So, even though the spelling in Harry Potter was Americanized before it was sold here, its origin is British, so the standard would be British.  The standard from canon in NCIS would be American English, and so on and so forth. </p>

            <p>I managed to thrash out a large portion of that through trial and error, but there were things I didn&#39;t know before (how to insert images, for one), and it&#39;s nice to have it all in one tidy place.<br><br>A few things, yes. First, I&#39;ll second July about the British vs American point; just to make it worse, in NZ (and Australia) we use aspects of both, so I&#39;d rather not have people tell me I&#39;m wrong or inconsistant when I am neither.<br><br>Also, you call this &quot;#&quot; the &quot;pound&quot; sign.

            <p>I only wish I had been able to refer to this back when I started editing Wikis, instead of having to look at the coding on other pages to learn how to do things.  I still didn&#39;t know how to use images, or that the title of a page was supposed to be bolded in its first line of text.  I will absolutely be using this tutorial in the future, possibly for other Wikis as well.  Thank you so much for making this!<br><br>While we&#39;re on the subject of the Wiki, I noticed a couple of months ago that we have two Legend of Zelda pages:<br><br><a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Legend_of_Zelda"><a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Legend_of_Zelda">http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Legend_of_Zelda</a></a><br>and<br><a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda"><a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda">http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda</a></a><br><br>I wasn&#39;t really sure how to fix this, and nobody ever responded to my comment on the discussion page.  But maybe someone more in-the-know than I can take care of this now?</p>

            <p>My only complaint is the thing against certain Capitalizations Which Had Been Standard, but that&#39;s more of my personal preference going against general grammar stuff than anything else.<br><br>I&#39;d also say something against &quot;correcting&quot; when it has to do with American vs British English spelling and why we shouldn&#39;t do that in favor of either side, because I personally find it damned annoying when people do that in order for one version to be the &#39;preferred&#39; one. Because then it ends with people on the talk page going &quot;oh look I corrected how the article&#39;s name was spelled in the main page so now you have to change it to conform even though it was spelled right in the first place just not how I like it&quot;.</p>

            <p>If you&#39;re referring to &quot;agent&quot; and the like, capitalizing it all the time has never been standard. Jay and Acacia didn&#39;t do it, I don&#39;t do it, and I&#39;m pretty sure it varies depending on whose stories you look at.<br><br>I do think it would be nice to settle on British or American usage for the wiki. I don&#39;t personally care which, but choosing one would settle the question of what&#39;s &quot;correct&quot; there for good, and you wouldn&#39;t get a mix of both on the same page. Or, if we <i>want</i> to do that--say we like the American use of double quotes, but we also like the British use of non-dialogue punctuation outside the quotes--it would be good to get it down in writing, once and for all. It would eliminate the kind of problem you mentioned.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Yes, and I&#39;m well aware it&#39;s not standard, just saying it&#39;s personal preference on my part (and thus doesn&#39;t contribute to any reason for changing it on the wiki).<br><br><br>I&#39;d say that at least keeping it settled on individual pages is important- Imposter vs Impostor and all that. American English tells me that the first one is correct as well, and I wasn&#39;t pleased when someone changed the entire page so it was contrary to what the link said the page was for and then declared we had to change the link to match.  <br><br>Because on one hand, TOS is American English. But on the other hand, a sizable amount of contribution to backstory, well, hS&#39; stuff, is British English. <br><br>Additionally, I think that trying to force to stick with just one or the other the entire way through is only asking for trouble and is a bit against the whole &#39;spirit of the PPC&#39; thing in the way of &#39;When did we start going &quot;conform, conform to a single standard&quot; etc&#39;, and would just rather prefer we try and keep to the same usage that was already predetermined by the page&#39;s original author and so on.<br><br>This is reaching the point of terrible rambling, but basically, it can be summed up as, &quot;I&#39;d feel weird if we went to British English spelling, etc for the pages on Jay, Acacia or the original series, or on any of the American writers&#39; spinoffs and agents and I&#39;d feel equally weird if we went to American English spelling and thingies for any of the British stuff and &#39;Reorganization&#39; just  isn&#39;t the same as &#39;Reorganisation&#39;&quot;. If that makes sense. <br><br>Either way, it is late o clock.</p>

            <p>Just for the record, further research reveals that both Firefox&#39;s spell-checker and my word processor&#39;s agree that &quot;imposter&quot; is not standard even in America, even if it is listed as an alternative spelling in the dictionary--and the &quot;alternative&quot; part means just that: an option, not the first choice.

            <p>So far as I can tell, the main issues with execution methods are that execution methods have to fit into canon, thus the canon-appropriate weapons; or the portaling of Sues into dangerous locations or within reach of dangerous creatures. Portaling Sues into other continua for execution is generally frowned on but still done occasionally.<br><br>Torture for torture&#39;s sake doesn&#39;t fit into most canons; and where it does, it tends to draw attention to the Sue--which is the opposite of what&#39;s desirable. Humiliating the Sue makes sense; karmic or ironic deaths make sense; but torture just makes her more sympathetic, which is a Bad Idea. The purpose of a mission is to restore canon, not to get revenge (though agents understandably forget this more often than not!).<br><br>Torture can be physical or mental. I think, for example, that somebody on the Wiki mentioned the possibility of disposing of a Sue via the Jaunt--which is torture by any standard despite the lack of pain. Choosing a painful death, especially by canonical methods (like Mirwood spiders), is not forbidden. Deliberately causing more pain, however, is frowned on (for example, shooting a Sue repeatedly in not-immediately-fatal locations is torture; shooting her once and letting her bleed to death is not).<br><br>I know--it&#39;s a thin line. But hey, they&#39;re assassins; what do you expect?</p>

            <p>Thing is, from certain parts of Germany, it IS possible to get to Poland in a few hours. Berlin to Warsaw is only about 320 miles. At the German speed limit of 80 m/h, that&#39;s a 4 hour trip, not accounting for traffic. A train would go about the same speed, if not a little slower.<br><br>A 1930s train would, at full steam, go about 70 m/h, so a 4 or 5 hour train ride into Poland is not out of the question. That is, provided you&#39;re in eastern Germany. From western Germany, like Munich, it would take almost 9 hours going full speed for a train to arrive in Warsaw.<br><br>Please note that this is just an estimate, actual numbers may vary.<br>(Source: Google Maps, Google, Wikipedia)</p>

            <p>If you&#39;re going to think of new weapon ideas, I think the best direction to go isn&#39;t in terms of power, but in terms of uniqueness. For example, I&#39;m thinking of having one of my agents use a set of throwing axes. I haven&#39;t seen that done before, and it&#39;d be kind of a trademark. (Plus, some of the sue types would really look better with an axe through their foreheads, don&#39;tcha think?)<br><br>In terms of weapons, interesting is a hundred times better than powerful. Agents aren&#39;t supposed to be particularly powerful, because any kind of power overload puts them in danger of turning into mary sues themselves, which has happened, and which generally ends with the agent in question either having to be assassinated himself, or having to undergo intense treatment to get his non-sue/stu self back. If they do something crazy awesome, it&#39;s either because they&#39;ve botched things badly and had to scramble to survive, or because the sue in question is just that bad and they got cornered. So it&#39;s more a question of creativity and caution than guns-blazing overly powerful characters.<br><br>They&#39;re also not supposed to use weapons that don&#39;t fit into the canon they&#39;re policing (this is why blades of some sort are popular--they&#39;ll fit into just about anything). Using uncanonical weapons tends to defeat the purpose of removing uncanonical things in fics, after all. So your BFG would fit into some video games and a few comic books, but not most other continua.<br><br>The point is not to be powerful, but to be interesting. Missions can get repetitive after a while because badfic itself is often quite repetitive; so your agents have to get their own style in order to be interesting.<br><br>I definitely think getting creative with weapons would be a great idea; but you&#39;d have to think of which world you&#39;re going into, and whether your weapon would fit in; also what your agent&#39;s personality is and why s/he favors that weapon. You could use an improvised weapon, for example, like a big heavy cooking pan; or you could have someone use a trademark poison (got to be a canon substance, remember--and research its effects first). Some agents use depowered Sue weapons, often fancy swords with the powers taken out of them to avoid Sue-ifying the agent.<br><br>A non-human agent could use physical or mental powers that are natural to him; similarly, an agent in a disguise with various sorts of powers could use those powers (ex. an Uruk-Hai disguise is strong enough to snap a mary-sue&#39;s neck, or to handle a longbow that requires a lot of strength to pull). Once again, power levels that are too high are really risky.<br><br>Anyway, point being: Be creative, but watch your power levels, or you might find your agents being hauled off for having too high a blood glitter level...</p>

            <p>Throwing axes are an <i>excellent</i> idea; as you say, a trademark uniqueness without being &#39;too much&#39;.

Little techno-gadgets, invented at need to carry out a mission, are very different from highly-powered tools which can turn a humurous mission into a Battle For The Best Weapon.

            <p>Personally, I&#39;m actually quite fond of them, especially for anime continuua (that is the proper plural of continuum, isn&#39;t it? If not, I apologize). Depending on the story, the characters might still retain whatever superpowers/odd physical traits they had in canon, or still have part of them, or have nothing but the name. These last make me sad, but oh well. Moving on.<br><br>Killing them is both easy and not, I would imagine. (All of this is hypothetical, mind, since my agents a) aren&#39;t assassins, and b) have never worked in an AU before. Actually, for that matter, they&#39;ve never worked anywhere, officially. I&#39;ve been slacking on the writing of their missions. But that&#39;s completely off topic.) Most AUs are set in what can be assumed to be World 1, so you have access to all of the World 1 weapons. On the other hand, getting guns etc. into High School isn&#39;t terribly easy, and they tend to be chock-full of OCs who would notice. I&#39;d say if you had something subtle like a curare-tipped blow dart, it might be the most effective. Killing someone in math class is surely fun, though charging them in class might be a bit disrespectful to the teacher. <br><br>--anamia</p>

            <p>Don&#39;t worry about not knowing enough about the PPC. Nobody does at first. Besides, you&#39;ve got a whole month before you can ask for permission anyway--which is a mercy, because it really does take that long to learn everything well enough. I&#39;m three weeks in and still feel like I don&#39;t know enough yet. (Not that you have to request permission in exactly a month, or ever for that matter). Agents often get dumped in without much training, but their writers generally don&#39;t. :)</p>

            <p>If you&#39;re dealing with a continuum that has mecha as very commonplace, you may be able to use a disguise that will be able to deal with your sue or possessed canons. If not, you&#39;ll have to use a disguise that&#39;s normal for that continuum, and get creative. It&#39;s almost always preferable to disable powerful Sues by stealth and trickery rather than trying to fight them outright. Sometimes you can wait for a part of the fic where they&#39;re hurt or unconscious and capture them then.<br><br>I don&#39;t like High school AUs, but they&#39;re a well known fanfic genre, and good ones (presumably) exist. They are written with three basic rules in mind:<br>1. The characters have grown up in a modern world.<br>2. The characters are all the same age--namely, teenagers.<br>3. The characters are all attending high school.<br><br>Like any AU, the issues aren&#39;t with the changes that make it AU, but with not fully exploring the results of those changes, with general bad writing, and with creating unrealistic, implausible situations that are meant to do no more than set up a favorite pairing.<br><br>Pulling the characters out of character in any way that couldn&#39;t be justified by having them grow up as, and be, modern high school students is still bad writing. You will often find that a Mary sue is at the center of the plot, either a sue version of a canon character or an OC.</p>

            <p>You can get creative. I don&#39;t know which fandoms you like, but go here and read some of these mission reports:<br><a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/The_Complete_List_of_PPC_Fiction"><a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/The_Complete_List_of_PPC_Fiction">http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/The_Complete_List_of_PPC_Fiction</a></a><br><br>Check out how other people have gone about it. Oh, and remember the Sue has to be charged first, while conscious. The important thing is that she ends up dead (though some Suefics have the Sue commit suicide or make a heroic sacrifice, and these must be killed some other way before they can manage it, since that sort of thing cements their influence over the canon).<br><br>List of assassination methods people have used is here:<br><a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Assassination_methods"><a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Assassination_methods">http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Assassination_methods</a></a><br><br>You&#39;ll notice some straightforward cases of simply shooting the target or killing them with some weapon (or their bare hands); other agents will use some aspect of canon to kill the sue (a canonical monster, natural disaster, dangerous location, etc.) or to dispose of the body. Portaling a Middle-Earth Sue into Mount Doom is practically standard, for example.<br><br>You&#39;ll have to re-state that last question; I don&#39;t know what you mean by &quot;lead some people to the other locations&quot;.</p>
