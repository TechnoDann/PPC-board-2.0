            <p>Well, I&#39;ve put the introductory thread, now I&#39;m going to have a series of rants describing myself and several things you can expect to hear about.  After this expect a list of the characters I intend to have as agents (before you ask, it won&#39;t be my acceptance thingy, it will be their adventures as they wait to take the test to become agents).  <br><br>First, a bit about me, I like EVERYTHING, there isn&#39;t a single thing I don&#39;t like, go ahead try me, however I don&#39;t like clowns, I HATE CLOWNS!<br><br>Now a bit about my writing, I&#39;ve never really published my fanfic, I might start doing that now and if I do you might find a link with the question, is it badfic?  I honestly can never tell if something I&#39;ve written is badfic or not, if it isn&#39;t YAY ME!  If it is, I will personally commit seppuku and have my team of agents (when and if they get approved) rip any Mary/Gary Sue&#39;s/Stu&#39;s to shreds, as well as fix the badfic immediately.</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve recently dug up some of my older works, edited them slightly (I think you&#39;ll be able to guess what&#39;s been edited) and have been thinking of putting them online in preparation for becoming an Agent.  Only problem is, where should I put them?  Technically a few of these could be considered fanart so perhaps fanfiction.net but for other things such as original works where should I publish them?<br><br>I&#39;m pretty sure you don&#39;t want me to just post these fairly long stories on a topic but would rather I gave you a link, so any suggestions for a good site to put them?</p>

            <p>I&#39;d recommend a Dreamwidth or Livejournal account-- you do need an invite code for DW, but I can get you one of those. Posting things like that here is a bad idea, partly because yes, one long thread might cause raised eyebrows, and partly because old threads, as noted, fall off the edge of the page, and eventually, the internet, and you&#39;ll lose them. If you have a blogthingie of your own, you can archive them... Forever! *cackles*<br><br>Er, yes. So... Livejournal&#39;s good, or Dreamwidth.</p>

            <p>Rape = love. Uh-huh. That, that&#39;s one of my berserk buttons, right there. What, what, <i>what</i> could possibly make <i>anyone</i> think that this... travesty is an expression of love? Yeesh...<br><br>That fic was evil. Not just bad, <i>evil</i>. It should have been titled &#39;How to make Christians cry in one easy lesson&#39;. Even the few fragments of it that you put in your mission are enough to make anyone sick. How do you stand this stuff, Miah? I can&#39;t imagine you can write missions about stuff like this without having to take regular breaks to keep from throwing up. I sure couldn&#39;t.<br><br>Also, how the hell does this thing get off calling itself a Sherlock Holmes fic? There&#39;s not a single moment of brilliant (or even average) detecting going on in there. <i>What gives?</i> This thing belongs on an original fiction site. Well, it doesn&#39;t really belong anywhere, but you catch my drift. A fic where priest!Holmes solves a crime in his parish, now that could have been a good fic.<br><br>Good to see that Unger is getting to be semi-literate. Should make missions a lot easier for him. Also, it was neat to see him take charge. It&#39;s usually Kelok who heads the operation (not that that&#39;s a bad thing, mind you.) ;) Kid&#39;s really growing up.<br><br>I&#39;m also glad you saved David (not Kelok, the other one). Poor kid really didn&#39;t deserve to die, especially not for an utterly inane reason like that.<br><br>Finally, on a totally unrelated note, the way you described the ME-cube make me think back to some childhood toys. Ahhh, memories... *drifts off*<br><br>(I hope you&#39;ll forgive my not posting this sooner. Been incredibly busy studying lately, simply haven&#39;t had time to sit down and read.)</p>

            <p>I don&#39;t understand the rape=love thing either. Not that it would be a Sherlock Holmes story, but if they had changed the names and used the same set up, it could have been an interesting story, but instead they went off into how much being harassed, attacked, and tortured made the Priest fall in love.  <br><br>I really did have to stop a lot on this fic. I started it as their fourth mission, but kept putting it off to do something less NSFB. What finally got me through it was realizing how over the top Watson&#39;s dialogue was. Once I realized that, I could get some distance from it, and do the mission.<br><br>I&#39;m glad that the mission took the turns it did. The whole something&#39;s wrong with Kelok, and therefore Unger gets to shine in this one, was not actually planned ahead. I realized I had written Kelok really out of character, and instead of going back to put him in character, I made myself think of a reason for him being OOC.<br><br>I hope that someone adopts David, and he gets to have a long and productive career in the PPC.</p>

            <p>Heh :) Anyway, I liked the way you found a place for the See-through Device; when I dug that out of the archives I had no idea anybody would ever find it useful! But with Unger&#39;s illiteracy, it&#39;s perfect. Also, I suppose, in cases of bad grammar manifesting in ways that can&#39;t be predicted by just reading the Words.<br><br>Unger is very, very lucky he didn&#39;t meet Lux... Actually, they were very lucky they weren&#39;t spotted by the character replacements; the SEP field wouldn&#39;t have done squat if they&#39;d been properly noticed. Not to mention the sanity drain of the whole horrid thing--this is the kind of fic that sends agents insane (or KIA) and yours just survived it--kudos to them for that, for sure! (And to you, for putting yourself through it. That kind of fic just NEEDS to be killed.)<br><br>Thought it was especially offensive the way they had the characters throw the Bible to the ground. Putting aside all the questions about whether that would ever be in character, it&#39;s as though the author&#39;s implying that if you&#39;re gay you can&#39;t be Christian and if you&#39;re Christian you automatically hate gay people... or something. I mean, HELLOO!!! It&#39;s total bunk. I&#39;m about as Christian as it gets and neither I nor most of the Christians I know reject gays; it&#39;s just the idiotic Westboro types who give us all that bad reputation. I feel like the author just accused me of hating people for no good reason and it&#39;s not a good feeling, y&#39;know?<br><br>Rant over...<br><br>I wonder who&#39;s going to adopt David? He sounds like he wouldn&#39;t be very happy about being in the DMS, with his timid nature; maybe DBS--a heavy dose of Bad Slash&#39;s status quo welcome to non-straight people might do him a lot of good. Is anybody running a DBS agent in need of a partner?<br><br>Does Kelok have issues with feeding on Sue so often? Seems to me he should be getting regular medical checkups to make sure his glitter levels stay low... not that he&#39;d mind, I imagine... :)</p>

            <p>I probably have not given the glitter issue nearly enough thought. He&#39;s always sick or injured when he feeds on them, which means he gets to see Nurse Lillian shortly thereafter. I think next time, I will have to have her discussing his glitter levels with him.<br><br>Hmm. Unger meeting Lux. He&#39;s probably young and dumb enough to think he might want to meet Lux. I doubt he&#39;d think that for very long after meeting her, though.<br><br>This fic was extremely hard to get through. I actually started it to be there either fourth or fifth mission, but kept putting it off. I almost completely quit during that scene in the pulpit.  It wasn&#39;t until the point where they laugh at the over-the-top ridiculousness of Watson&#39;s line that I was able to get away from the immediate horribleness and move the story forward.<br><br>I do hope someone adopts David (his name can be changed). I just didn&#39;t think I could handle another agent myself, and it was really annoying that he was created just to die a slow, painful death for no good reason.<br><br>Thank you for your response. I&#39;ve definitely got to consider that glitter issue before he does that again--I am glad you brought it up.<br></p>

            <p>I&#39;ve been looking through my OCs, all created for play-by-post forum roleplays I frequent, in search of potential Agents. One&#39;s come to mind who I feel I&#39;ll need a second opinion about. Said character is a Bleach OC; a Shinigami who, everywhere I&#39;ve played him, has held the position of First Division Lieutenant. Because of this, his replacing a canon character within these RPs, I feel I might need to ask established Agents whether he&#39;d be safe to use, or needs to be detached from the &quot;canon&quot;.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m really bothered by this end result: &quot;Happy Single Teenage Mom&quot;. Now, there&#39;s a question that gets you to that result, which is &quot;Does she get an abortion?&quot;. However, it offers no other than choice than &quot;Ha ha. Of course she doesn&#39;t.&quot; This single choice happens to bring you to the end result that I had mentioned early.<br><br>Now, I&#39;m bugged by this because it seems that it assumes that just because a teenage girl gets pregnant, then she will be atomatically happy with the baby and refuse the abortion. I know that they&#39;ll get in trouble either way, but why isn&#39;t there a &quot;no&quot; choice or something? After all, not all teens are gonna be happy with being a parent.<br><br>I&#39;m also bugged by this question: &quot;Is she a teenager&quot;, because if we answer the question, then the female doesn&#39;t get a choice either way: Either she&#39;s a teen and this leads to the things I&#39;ve mentioned before, or she&#39;s a woman and thus gets forced to get together with a man all of a sudden.<br><br>Sorry if I&#39;m rambling like this, but this chart bugs me a lot, especially with it&#39;s instructions about how to create a strong female character.</p>

            <p>Very elaborite considering there&#39;s only one path to strong female characterness. Besides, some of these categories (Lady McBeth?

            <p>Basically, she was just eye candy there to run the radio. But eventually, she did get her own plot lines and took on a more active role. If you get into the novels, she tends to be the person who can get a message through when no one else can... at one point I think she even uses semaphore. (Was that her, or was that Scotty? Hmm... I can&#39;t remember now, it&#39;s been ten years since I read those books...)</p>

            <p>This pisses me off a bit. Probably because there is only one way to get your character to be a &quot;Strong Female Character&quot;. I refuse to believe that just because a character represents an idea of any kind, this immediately disqualifies her from the category of actually being a good character. Also that a sexy, sane villain is nothing but an underling. <br><br>*sigh*</p>

            <p>Partly because of the feminist in me-- why are there charts like this for <i>female</i> characters and yes, I know there&#39;s male characters out there, too. But why is it that for female characters, there&#39;s... gah, I&#39;m not sure how to word this. <br><br>I guess what bothers me is that male characters get to be Special, or Awesome, or the like, without being categorized like this (except on TV Tropes). For example, following the arrows that get you to &quot;Psycho Feminist Lesbian Amazon&quot; would be likely to get you any number of different &quot;reasonable&quot; male characters. <br><br>That, and I dislike formulas applied to writing, as though it were some kind of machine-- enter -these- coordinates, and you&#39;ll get X. Enter this instead, and you&#39;ll get Y. Writing is a fluid thing, and reducing something as huge as a character to a flow-chart just bothers me.</p>

            <p>At least, not in my book, and definitely not <i>here</i>. Or in the more intelligent parts of fandom. But out in the media world? Girl characters are held to a <i>much</i> higher standard, and how classically attractive they are is a much bigger part of their characterisation-- a girl who&#39;s tall, slender, and has smooth skin gets a different character base  than a girl who&#39;s short, pudgy, and has acne, even if they have <i>identical</i> personalities-- with a guy, far less attention is paid to the appearance.<br><br>Same goes for powers. Imagine a witch in Harry Dresden&#39;s place-- you&#39;d get a <i>lot</i> more accusations of Mary Sueism, even if absolutely nothing else was changed. It&#39;s just frustrating, is all. I know that&#39;s not the standard here, but it seems to be most other places.</p>

            <p>I wouldn&#39;t put him at Stu-level. His major Stuish trait is his sheer power; I can&#39;t really think of anything else about him that&#39;d be a problem. Even the power level isn&#39;t an issue because everything out there in the world is just as powerful as he is, or more. I think he&#39;d be different if he were female, though. I wonder if there are any good gender-switch fics for him? His gender does affect his personality a good deal, what with his &quot;got to help the female in distress&quot; syndrome and his relationships with the various female characters.</p>

            <p>Though, I wasn&#39;t so much annoyed my the &quot;idea&quot; aspect as by the fact that a strong female character can&#39;t be a soldier, a police woman that deals with an armed and dangerous criminal in the first act or someone who has picked up murder as a profession. Those are all likely to kill someone by the third act.<br><br>From the looks of the chart, where it says, &quot;strong female character&quot;, it should have said, &quot;no one writes a character like this&quot;.

            <p>I don&#39;t think a character has to be a &quot;strong female character&quot; to be a useful female character. Your basic bit character or Generic doesn&#39;t have to be any more than a few words slapped together into a general category of character. If every female character were a fully realistic person, we couldn&#39;t fit them all into the story. The main characters, yeah, but not every single other character.<br><br>If your character is based on an idea and is a minor character, then you don&#39;t have to go beyond the idea. But if they&#39;re a major character then the only choice is to have them go beyond just the personification of some idea (for example--Cosette in &quot;Les Miserables&quot; is practically the personification of femininity). Otherwise, if they stick with just being the personification of an idea instead of a character that happens to be closely associated with an idea, they won&#39;t have a lot of depth to them.<br><br>I think maybe that was what the chart&#39;s author was trying to get at--the way a character has to have more than just one theme, how people aren&#39;t just defined by one major trait.</p>

            <p>I do hope you only mean that in reference to the question, which is a bit dated in the first place. Wouldn&#39;t be surprised to see a Chile miner question pop up, but it&#39;s not like these are meant to be representative of the whole of LJ, which you seem to be implying. And I have no doubt that LJ has megabytes of stuff about the Chilean miners, and almost all of it in support or admiration.<br><br>Not that the miners had it all rosy anyway - the reason they are keeping silent about the first 17 days before they were found is apparently because they couldn&#39;t stand each other and kept getting into fistfights. They split into three groups that bunked and worked separately to avoid each other. <br><br>But this has nothing to do with gender - if you are stuck under hundreds of feet of rock, with scant hope of survival, you are entitled to get a bit frustrated and angry over it, especially if you&#39;ve had issues with the other guys down there before. <br><br>Just, don&#39;t venerate people for no good reason, and especially not for an agenda.</p>

            <p>What&#39;s wrong with having someone be supporting by believing in them?  She was the support for the main character. That&#39;s how literature works.

The question didn&#39;t seem sexist either, it was just asking a question.  If anything, she did more than usual.

Only that, in many forms of media, women take no active role beyond passively believing in someone, and doing nothing to aid them beyond that rather abstract belief. I object to that.

            <p>I didn&#39;t mean that having a woman be supportive is sexist, no. But the way the question phrased it was irritating and got under my skin. Basically, it implied that the woman was extraordinary because and only because she supported him <i>passively</i>. The passive, oh-honey-I-believe-in-you support, as opposed to the Pepper Potts*, &quot;I-believe-in-you-and-therefore-I-am-going-to-take-action-and-make-sure-everything-work-and-be-proactive-backup.&quot; And it just kept on <i>only</i> asking about, or looking at, supportive women. It&#39;s not the existence of women in support positions, but the emphasis on them, that bothered me.<br><br>(As to the horse thing: Lesson learned, it was a reasonable assumption, and if the woman is the human protagonist than the phrasing bothers me even more).<br><br><br><br>*Movieverse!Pepper; don&#39;t know the comics, don&#39;t want to cause more trouble. And yes, I know there are issues with Movieverse!Pepper, mostly in the way she cannot keep her head in a fight, but I loved her proactive support schtick. </p>

            <p>The question is &quot;How has the strength and support of an extraordinary woman helped you achieve an impossible goal?&quot; It says nothing about being passive or active. Depending on the reader&#39;s interpretation, it could be either. I don&#39;t see why you think it&#39;s necessarily passive support.<br><br>Also, I think believing in someone <i>isn&#39;t</i> necessarily a passive role. If you&#39;re attempting something impossible, like the question says, simply having someone in your corner can be very powerful. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s demeaning to suggest as much.<br><br>As for emphasis, it&#39;s just one question, based on one situation in one movie. It&#39;s not like LJ is insisting that women can only ever take support roles and nothing else, so I don&#39;t think there&#39;s any call to accuse them of being sexist.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I got the impression the question was discussing the jockey - and if it isn&#39;t, it&#39;s very badly phrased.<br><br>Also, the question itself is still asking about how women have <i>supported</i> the reader, so the question is still a problem.</p>

            <p>If your point is that a horse can&#39;t be an athlete, I know several horse people who would beg to differ.<br><br>And I will say straight up I disagree with your issue. Is receiving support from an amazing woman somehow a bad thing? Does her support of you suddenly mean she can no longer do anything else aside from you? I had an amazing English teacher for most of middle school who taught me so much, not just English but many valuable skills regarding both academics and the living of life. She <i>supported</i> me so very much, but it makes her no less an amazing woman in her own right. <br><br>It doesn&#39;t mean that men have made any less contribution, but it does mean that the question made me think of specifically my female teacher, because the focus of it is on women who have supported and helped you. Is that a bad thing somehow, to acknowledge them? That&#39;s kind of the impression I&#39;m getting off you. <br><br>There&#39;s one other thing I&#39;d like to add, mostly to get out there and see what everyone else thinks. I&#39;ve always heard from both mother and father that a good judge for if something is sexist is to swap the genders out. The brawny yeoman draping himself on the lovely captain and proclaiming, &quot;Captain, I&#39;m frightened,&quot; is going to be laughed right off the bridge, but somehow it&#39;s perfectly all right the other way &#39;round -- or was, in its time. <br><br>However, this question is <i>How has the strength and support of an extraordinary woman helped you achieve an impossible goal?</i> Swap that out, and you&#39;re just asking about an extraordinary man. I am a-okay with that, actually.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m confused. If a man chooses to acknowledge me for the support I&#39;ve given him, I should be offended? A man acknowledging the support of his mother, sister, teacher, spouse... is sexist? How does that work? Also, what if I, a woman, want to acknowledge the support of another woman? Is it still sexist? If not, how come it is when a man does it? O.o<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Hello everyone. I&#39;m Becky, as you can probably tell.<br><br>I was first linked to the Original Series by TV Tropes...a year ago? Year and a half? A long time. After a few months of link-following, I eventually came across the Wiki, and from there, the Board. I&#39;ve been lurking here for a couple of months now. I know I shouldn&#39;t have waited so long for my introduction post, but I haven&#39;t been a proper member of a forum for years and I was rather nervous. I still am, in fact.<br><br>I don&#39;t plan on ever writing any missions: I&#39;m not very good at putting my daydreams into words, and I&#39;m not sure I can handle badfic without the protective layer of a sporking.<br><br>As for the drayni, they&#39;re a fictional species of mine. You&#39;ll probably never hear very much about them, for the same reason you&#39;ll probably never see a mission from me (except for the badfic part, of course).<br><br>Well, here goes... *clicks “post” button*</p>

            <p>I&#39;m a Runescape person myself, so for several years I didn&#39;t know. I nearly freaked out when I saw a Troper mention them. After a little research, I calmed down. They&#39;re not really similar in any way but the spelling, if I remember correctly.<br><br>I&#39;ve read lots of missions over the previous 12-18-ish months. I particularly like everything written by Huinesoron, Nume and Ilraen (and I&#39;m not just saying that as flattery), and Rose/Ross&#39;s missions. Lately I&#39;ve been looking over the Complete List of PPC Fiction again, reading everything I don&#39;t clearly remember reading before.<br><br>I&#39;m not part of any fandoms as I understand the term, but I like (among other things) New Who, Dragonback (haven&#39;t yet read the last book), Harry Potter, Thursday Next, Garth Nix&#39;s books (especially Keys to the Kingdom), Young Wizards... Not Lord of the Rings, though. I read The Fellowship of the Ring when I was nine or so and thought it was incredibly dull. On the other hand, I thought the same thing about A Wizard of Earthsea, but liked it much better when I tried again a few months ago. I have a long reading list at the moment, and my mom&#39;s Tolkien collection went missing during the move a couple years ago, so it&#39;s not a high priority.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m afraid I don&#39;t know anything about Runescape, aside from the fact that it&#39;s a game.<br><br>I definitely recommend trying LotR again now that you&#39;re older. It&#39;s not mile-a-minute shoot-em-up action, of course, but then why should it be? It&#39;s about so much more. {= )<br><br>If you prefer, though, try the BBC radio production by Brian Sibley. It&#39;s the best adaptation I know of in that, while they leave some things out for time, they don&#39;t <i>change</i> what&#39;s left. Also, the voices are great, and they actually sing or chant a bunch of the songs.<br><br>I&#39;m glad to hear you like my spin-off. ^_^ What in particular works for you about it?<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>The agents make the story. I&#39;ve read plenty of missions where I was totally unfamiliar with the canon, but it didn&#39;t really matter much. In fact, sometimes you&#39;re better off that way, because you don&#39;t feel the visceral horror of what the badfic&#39;s done.<br><br>Ilraen is quite likeable, and it&#39;s interesting to see how Nume deals with having an eidetic memory in a job that tends to create lots of bad ones. (Not to say that he isn&#39;t likeable too.)<br><br>The nice thing about a book, as opposed to radio, is that you can get lost in thought, space out for five minutes and the book will wait for you rather than keep playing.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m AgentS7, a newbie. Nice to meet you! I read your DOOM fanfic sporking, and there were quite a few lulz to be had there. From what everyone&#39;s saying, you&#39;re pretty important to the PPC. I guess I&#39;ll be reading some of your missions once I finish TOS! :-)<br><br>And here--take this Shark-Launcher. (It doesn&#39;t actually launch sharks, though. It just launches Robot Sharks. They were out of the &quot;Real Shark&quot; kind...some kind of PETA lawsuit.)</p>

            <p>Yeah, we generally refer to it by the brand-name, Jell-O, or just jello. Sometimes gelatin.

            <p>So, I&#39;m co-writing a Googledoc with another Board member. It&#39;s been working fine for the past few weeks, but now when I open it it comes up with a message telling me about a &quot;server error&quot; and asking me to reload. Reloading doesn&#39;t help, so I tried X-ing the box. The document then loads for a couple of pages, then the same message comes up again and when I X that one the document refuses to load any further.<br><br>Any idea what&#39;s causing this or how I can stop it?</p>

Sasuke proposes to Naruto, Naruto says no, Sasuke convinces Naruto to say yes by spiriting him away and ****ing him. The actual sex is not shown (thank God for that), but that does not make this thing any less creepy. Also, downright freakish levels of misogyny.

            <p>SttQ, I don&#39;t think anyone wants you to leave over a disagreement with one person. It is your decision, but I would hate to think a single incident ruined your whole experience here.<br><br>July, I&#39;ve noticed recently that you&#39;ve been getting on people&#39;s nerves a fair bit. I&#39;m not suggesting that you change your personality or anything, but would it kill you to choose your words with more care? We could stand a lot less in-fighting with you in the middle of it.<br><br>All in all, I don&#39;t think there was anything wrong with SttQ adding her two cents here. I often wish people who shared opinions would speak up more so that others could know the opinion is shared by many and not just a few. Rehashing the same points over again DOES get tiresome, but still, there&#39;s nothing wrong with making your voice heard.<br><br>Finally, when it comes to real people, this old adage is the best: &quot;If you can&#39;t say something nice, don&#39;t say anything at all.&quot; Read &quot;respectful&quot; or &quot;constructive&quot; for nice if you will, but please bear it in mind just the same.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

If you don&#39;t want people to get upset, you have to stop saying upsetting things, like accusing SttQ of being emotionally manipulative and not having respect for the dead--right after she mentioned having lost several people in her life, no less.

            <p>I was not saying Thalia Weaver was a superior random person to honor, but that her writing was better. I was wondering why a person would be highly honored for what I consider to be rather run-of-the-mill lemons. I&#39;m not saying that the writer couldn&#39;t do it if she thought that her friend was worth honoring, I was bewailing the fact that certain types of writing with inferior quality get celebrated while others go unrecognized by people in general.<br><br>Of course, you can say that *we* recognize Thalia Weaver&#39;s writing.

            <p>I liked the Bad Slash Bingo idea too. I guess that would work with Mary Sues too. If you had bigger cards, otherwise they&#39;d be full waaay too fast.</p>

            <p>I really do.  The Bad Slash bingo is a great idea. You should make some cards, or--it would be cool to have a Bad Slash bingo card generator.  <br><br>The last line was the best ever. &quot;I merely wanted to know where you got the tie.&quot; Excellent.<br><br>It kind of took me a while to get the hang of these two, but I am really starting to have expectations as to how they are likely to behave. I&#39;m feeling like I know them, which is really good. <br><br>I&#39;ve only seen Teen Titans a few times, but that fic was just bad. I&#39;ve run across a few of these self!cest fics lately in various fandoms.  They are rather odd, at best. Good job on killing it.</p>

            <p>Man, that was an extremely annoying Sue. I liked the bit about her threatening with the karate pose, and then getting her butt kicked in short order. I really enjoyed that. <br><br>I really like Tony as a character, and it bugs me when the Sue&#39;s decide that he is only good for goofing off. Of course, they were all so OOC that it was just bad, but it bugs me more with him being my favorite.  :)<br><br>Glad to see that Tasmin is calm enough again to get regular missions again. </p>

            <p>Glad to have done it.<br><br>In the original, the Sue took out a guy three times her size and kept kicking him after he was down. Quite sure that is not the way of the karateka, excessive force.<br><br>I think Tony gets to goof off so much because he does a bit on the show, and authors exaggerate that trade, forgetting that if all there was too him was a pretty smile, Gibbs would not have hired him.<br><br>Calm is a relative term, right?</p>

            <p>When giving links it&#39;s usually helpful to also provide a short summary of what is to be expected. At the very least provide information on fandom, rating and whether people might not want to read on the grounds of your kink is not my kink.</p>

            <p>Or picking the story apart, as it turned out.<br><br>Summary: Nathan gets assigned to his new partner, Ellipsia. Polystyrene ensues. <i>Technically, in this story, Nathan didn&#39;t get assigned a partner, he arrived at the Response Centre of his new partner. The assigning had already taken place.</i><br>Betaed: no<br><br>&quot;Ah, this is it.&quot; As Nathan arrived at the door to RC#7331, he ran his right hand trough his shortish hair, untousling it a bit. <i>This reads to me as: all the while that Nathan arrived at the door, he ran a hand through his hair. I don&#39;t think he did both at the same time. I think he arrived, and then ran a hand through his hair. As, however, means it happened at the same time. Which it can&#39;t, because arriving doesn&#39;t take a measurable amount of time, while running a hand through one&#39;s hair does. Can you tell I am not a fan of using &#39;as&#39;, or &#39;-ing&#39; for that matter, to indicate things happen at the same time. Far too often it is used for things that do not happen at the same time. Be careful of its use.</i> He wanted to make a good first impression with his new partner, wanted to show the professionalism he was renowned for. With one swift motion, he opened the door, <i>So, he wants to make a good impression, but doesn&#39;t bother knocking to announce there is a visitor.</i> took a deep breath and stepped in. One step.<br><br>&quot;Ohmygod.&quot; It took the tall man a while to get out of his stupor. <i>break for new paragraph.</i> The response center was a mess. Mildly speaking. There were boxes standing around, filled with polystyrene balls and/or empty packages from action figures. The figures themselves stood on everything that wasn&#39;t declared the floor. Most likely because the latter reminded Nathan of the old children&#39;s game &quot;the floor is made of lava&quot;. <i>Or because it was already filled with the boxes.</i> Only that in this case the lava was his kryptonite<s>. Even</s><i>: even</i> more polystyrene balls.<i>I&#39;m a bit confused about what this is about. If the floor is covered with polystyrene would he not have noticed that first and maybe later where all the action figures were? Also, just say the floor was covered with polystyrene.</i> &quot;This... this is ho-&quot; <i>break for new paragraph, because there is a new speaker.</i>&quot;Bleeprin&#39;s to the left.&quot; A head with two brown ponytails emerged from behind a PC monitor, together with a hand that pointed to a sideboard right next to the entrance. <i>break for new paragraph.</i>Nathan turned his head and indeed, there was a whole jar of Bleeprin, together with a half-empty bottle of water for swallowing it. Quickly, he reached over, grabbed one and drank the rest of the water. <i>grabbed one what? a jar or a bottle?</i> &quot;Thanks... so you are...&quot; His brows furrowed. That couldn&#39;t be. <i>break for new paragraph, because, again, someone else is speaking.</i>&quot;Agent Ellipsia, Elly for short.&quot; <i>break for new paragraph.</i>Nathan nodded, waiting for the Bleeprin to kick in.<br><br>Meanwhile, Ellipsia disappeared behind her screen again, hammering onto the keyboard furiously. &quot;ARGH! Of course you get agro when you use that spell<i>comma</i> you moron!&quot; She laid her lower arm onto the desk in front of the keyboard and started hitting her head against it. <i>break for new paragraph.</i> Nathan raised an eyebrow. Slowly, he staked<i>wrong word. Stake is to support with stakes, or to (aggressively) claim something (like territory) for yourself. I don&#39;t think Nathan is doing either.</i> trough the sea of polystyrene, trying to stay calm at the sound it made, until he stood behind her desk. &quot;So let me guess... Warcraft.&quot; <i>break for new paragraph.</i>&quot;No, I&#39;m sooo into Twilight. Of course!&quot; She gestured at the screen. <i>break for new paragraph.</i>Nathan sighed. &quot;Fun time... oh, and you just died.&quot; <i>break for new paragraph.</i>Her head dropped again. &quot;It&#39;s these groups that make me wish for a mission.&quot; Having grown frustrated enough, she hit Alt-F4 and stood up from her chair. <i>break for new paragraph.</i>To Nathan&#39;s surprise, she was almost as tall as him. <i>break for new paragraph.</i>The woman breathed in, smiled and stretched her hand out to him. &quot;Okay, for real this time. I&#39;m Elly, and you are...&quot; <i>break for new paragraph.</i>&quot;Nathan. Just Nathan.&quot; He shook her hand firmly, nodding to it. <i>break for new paragraph.</i>&quot;So you&#39;re my partner. Feel like you&#39;re at home.&quot; <i>break for new paragraph.</i>&quot;My home doesn&#39;t include... these.&quot; The man shivered when he looked down to the box filling on the ground, which made Elly giggle. <i>break for new paragraph.</i>&quot;Oh, you&#39;re one of these guys.&quot; <i>break for new paragraph.</i>The man straightened his clothes. &quot;I just like my place to be clean.&quot; With these words, he walked over to a second desk which was yet another storage place for huge boxes. Fortunately, they were empty, so Nathan could pick them up one by one and place them somewhere else. &quot;What are you doing with all these boxes? I mean why are you keeping them?&quot; <i>break for new paragraph.</i>Elly grinned. &quot;I like ball pools.&quot; <i>break for new paragraph.</i>&quot;<s>You</s><i>We</i>&#39;ll need a new jar of Bleeprin. Soon.&quot;</p>

The first is a grasp of punctuation so woefully weak that the whole damn work is barely legible. The second is the narrative itself, which seems to cut corners at every opportunity, to the point where the author skips the Agent of the Shinigami arc pretty much altogether and slices great chunks of content out of the Rescue arc. The third, and by far worst, is the grossly overpowered OC!Stu, who has two entirely different Shikai releases in one Zanpakuto, achieves them with no prior training, and can stand alone against FOUR Captains - including Yamamoto - upon his first ever release of the second form.

            <p>It has come to my attention that some departments do not have flash patch images on the Wiki!<br><br>I thought at first it was just the new DIAU that didn&#39;t have one; so I designed one (turns out it did have one; it was just a formatting error...)<br>Anyhow, here&#39;s my design--<br><img src="http://images2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20101019152526/ppc/images/thumb/6/68/DIAU_Patch.jpg/180px-DIAU_Patch.jpg"><br><br>I also made one for the All Purpose Department (though I don&#39;t know if it looks rubbery enough...)<br><img src="http://images4.wikia.nocookie.net/ppc/images/thumb/b/b5/All_Purpose_Flashpatch.jpg/180px-All_Purpose_Flashpatch.jpg"><br><br>Anyway, clicking through the departments, I saw that some of them had very hastily done flash patch images or else none at all. So I&#39;m posting here to say: If you have a good flash patch image for a PPC department, please put it up on the wiki!<br><br>Also, for those departments where we can&#39;t dig them up, does anyone object to my making more flash patches? I&#39;m not an artist and I did these in Paint... so yeah... but they aren&#39;t supposed to look really fancy anyway. I&#39;m going more for &quot;simple enough to embroider on a high-tech cloth patch&quot;. :)</p>

            <p>Are you using regular images, then turning them into &quot;cloth&quot; texture? I&#39;m using random background images (you know, from those &quot;free wallpaper&quot; sites) and transparency to get that effect, but that&#39;s not exactly the best solution, especially using MS Paint. I think I&#39;m getting an effect kind of like an iron-on patch; you&#39;re getting more like a printed cloth effect... I don&#39;t have photoshop and haven&#39;t had time to learn to use anything else at the moment.<br><br>Dang it, can we have some actual artists to draw these images? I am NOT AN ARTIST!!! Halp!!!<br><br>...Um. Yes.<br>*gathers up the extra exclamation points and hands out earplugs*<br>Sorry about that.<br><br>Your flash patches look great; can you upload and post them to the wiki (or give someone else permission to do so)?</p>

            <p>Um, I just want you guys to know, that stuff about how you&#39;ll not have lived if you haven&#39;t seen these parodies, and about how you <i>must</i> click the links, is not to be taken seriously.

            <p>I like the way your agents dealt with the bit-rapist.  Usually, such a character would be killed in a mission, or just disappear with the canon&#39;s reassertion.  But using the neuralyzer to make him into a normal person is a great idea!  It makes sense, too; since a bit doesn&#39;t have much personality anyway, there&#39;s nothing wrong with changing it.</p>

            <p>I don&#39;t know the first thing about the canon here, but I like to think I&#39;ve come to know a well-written Mission when I see one. Considering this was your first, I&#39;d say you&#39;ve done yourself proud.

            <p>My first mission! OMG no flamezzz!!1!lol!one!<br><br><a href="http://galenfea-ppc.livejournal.com/818.html">The mission</a> is SFW - I purposefully kept the descriptions vague, since the original fic was pretty violent.<br>It&#39;s one for Cassie&#39;s challenge - no Sue and the only sort-of death is what happens to the villain.

            <p>It&#39;s been a while since someone&#39;s done LotR, too. Which department are your agents in? (We need a wiki article for &quot;Bad Action&quot;. I&#39;ve seen so many botched fight scenes it&#39;s just sad...)<br><br>Aragorn and his &quot;brothers&quot; ducking each other in a river when Aragorn is thirty doesn&#39;t actually seem too odd to me, though. All three of them are generally serious characters; but they are (foster) siblings and I don&#39;t see why a few minutes of light-heartedness between them is all that OOC. Guess it depends how you write it.<br><br>But the rest, I agree with you: Head injuries do NOT work that way. And this is coming from someone who&#39;s had the opportunity to actually examine all the tiny little structures involved--believe you me, the skull can only do so much, especially when the brain is bouncing around inside it like a Superball. Randomly healing concussions... *sigh* Some of these writers SO need a basic anatomy class.<br><br>Your agents are generally safe without disguises if there aren&#39;t any OCs involved, but if the canons are OOC enough, or verge into Canon Sue territory, the agents are in danger of being detected.<br><br>The author in this fic seems to have been distorting Middle-earth geography like one of those rubber sheets you see in gravity demonstrations... only worse. Which makes sense, actually, because the uncanon elements can distort the geography and the timeline, and when you remove them they disappear...<br><br>OK, enough rambling. Liked your mission.</p>

            <p>They&#39;re in Floaters at the moment. If I keep finding bad action/adventure fics I might see if it&#39;s OK for me to make a new department and transfer them to it. The next one I&#39;ve got my eye on is more in the direction of bad het, though (ignorance of archery, gut wounds, head injuries and how large an army of over two thousand actually <i>is</i> aside), so I&#39;m not sure. I&#39;d definitely be prepared to actively look them out, though, if other people also think it necessary! :D<br><br>Hmm... I don&#39;t know. I probably should have included more quotes from the actual story there - the whole scene came across to me as really childish. Light-heartedness is one thing and I do have a weakness for lighter fics, but devoid of all other cues, I probably would have guessed the ages of the people involved as under twelve - I probably could have made that clearer in the mission, though.<br><br>*laugh* I admit getting all the details of this sort of thing is <i>hard</i> and I salute you for having studied it in detail, but I do feel like &#39;Being bashed on the head is bad&#39; should be fairly obvious. Sometimes I think kids should be taught about head injuries at a young age at school.<br><br>OK. I figured they weren&#39;t out of character enough for it to be a problem in this one, especially as Jackson and Felaben weren&#39;t going to get too close (while the canons were conscious) and the canons would have other things to worry about. I was planning to use disguises when there are lots of or important OCs and/or when the canons are 50% or more OOC - does that sound about right as a rough rule of thumb?<br><br>Heh. Yeah, I spent some time looking between the fic and a map, estimating how far you could walk or ride in a day and thinking &#39;where the Hell is this part taking place?&#39;. There was <i>no way</i> Elrond in particular should have been able to cover that sort of distance in a few days, partly on foot.<br><br>Heh. That was <i>really</i> rambling. :) Thank you for reading the mission, and I&#39;m glad you liked it!</p>

            <p>Congratulations on your first mission!<br><br>I really like the interplay between your twin agents. Quarrelsome yet caring, just the way I like it. Also, the story of Felaben&#39;s genesis is original, to say the least.<br><br>That wraith had some nerve, using so-called &#39;artistic license&#39; as an excuse to have canon characters as torture dummies. I said it before, and I&#39;ll say it again: torture can be a plot <i>device</i>, but not a whole plot. That&#39;s just wrong.

            <p>&quot;The Department Head has stated that the purpose of Legal is to maintain the balance between order and chaos, as represented by their Departmental logo, the Legal Chao. The Chao (pronounced &quot;cow&quot;) resembles a yin-yang with order represented by the five-frond fern on one side and chaos by the anti-gravity apple on the other. The significance of the anti-gravity apple is unknown - it is rumoured to represent the Head of the Physics Division, a former Head of Department, or something else entirely.&quot;</p>

            <p>Welcome, Jimmy. Just so you know, this is a writing-centric sort of place-- we value grammar, spelling, and capitals here. In the future, it&#39;d be much appreciated if you made an effort to type your posts without l33tspeak, and with correct capitalisation. Along the same lines, <a href="http://twistedskein.webs.com/PPCHome/Constitution.htm">here is our Constitution</a>. It&#39;s a list of guidelines to posting here; please read it before continuing to post. We also have a <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/PPC_Wiki">Wiki</a>, for the curious; any number of helpful links and interesting things can be found thereabouts.<br><br>I think we give gifts instead of pokes, these days, so I&#39;ll offer the traditional whisk, towel, and flamethrower. Welcome to the &#39;Board, and I&#39;ll see you around!<br><br>(ah! Knew I&#39;d forget something... As an aside-- we tend to try not to create too many individual threads unnecessarily, here; replies are far better, as every new thread pushes an old one off the edge of the page. Probably better to tell you now than wait until you&#39;ve done it accidentally and have to be told.)</p>
