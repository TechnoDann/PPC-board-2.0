            <p>If you hang out in the IRC, you may have heard Barid and I talking about the Super Secret Co-Write of Secrecy.

A three-way co-write. The last time this happened, it took years to complete. But not this time.

            <p>I am in a group of FIVE people and co-write a... thing that would drive an entire department mad. It&#39;s a mega-crossover that started as a parody, but evolved into a more serious story.However, I was 14 when we begun, and the others even younger (one as 9), so it&#39;s quite a bad-witten thing at the beginning, but now we write better (it was our &quot;writing gym&quot;, we used it to improve). It has a double Creativity Shield and it is placed in an AU, just to avoid troubles, since there are too much things that would cause troubles to canons. Just a small list: Sakura and Li from Card Captor Sakura break up (and that erases Tsubasa Reservoir Chronicle from existance), it&#39;s revealed that Voldemort was good while Albus Silente and Harry Potter evil, and a lot of things that usually would be charges. However, we are trying to save the good original plot and characters for an original story.</p>

            <p>With specific regards to Harry Potter, one of the reasons for name translation, at least of Voldemort&#39;s name, is to maintain the anagram (&quot;Tom Marvolo Riddle&quot; —&gt; &quot;I am Lord Voldemort&quot;). Thus, in French, he&#39;s &quot;Tom Elvis Jedusor&quot; to allow for &quot;je suis Voldemort&quot;.<br><br>But &quot;Voldemort&quot; doesn&#39;t change, even though it actually means something in French.</p>

            <p>Since it is a sort of &quot;writing gym&quot; it doesn&#39;t have an end, there are many arc, every one with its plot. Currently, it has something like 200+ pages.<br><br>However, we are planning to use the Original Characters and some of the plot in an original fiction, or maybe in a book.<br><br>And, yes. In Italy Albus Dumbledore is known as Silente.

            <p>That sounds fun, actually. More like an ongoing role-play than a story, maybe.<br><br>Good luck with the book part. {= )<br><br>That&#39;s interesting. It certainly fits him, though according to the <a href="http://www.hp-lexicon.org/index-2.html">Harry Potter Lexicon</a>, Rowling chose &quot;Dumbledore&quot; because it&#39;s an old word for bumblebee, and she imagines him walking around humming to himself.

            <p>it&#39;s similar to a roleplay, every autor has an Author Avatar (originally they were self-inserts, but later they became independent characters) and is written as a roundrobin.<br>It features characters from &quot;La bambina della Sesta Luna&quot; (an Italian book, the story started on the author&#39;s forum), Detective Conan, Card Captor Sakura, Harry Potter, and a lot of cameo appearance. The last chapters are quite decent (if chapters is the right name, by now they are 161 with leght between 1/3 of a page and a couple pages), but at the beginning it was a complete mess. In fact, its name is &quot;Mai Dire Fine&quot; (literally &quot;Never Say End&quot;, quite appropriate) but we call it &quot;Thriller Polpettonico&quot; (roughly &quot;poutpourry thriller&quot;, where thriller was used wityh the meaning of &quot;action and suspance&quot; and &quot;polpettonico&quot;... for all remaining)<br><br>It&#39;s the home continuum of the detective and rally car driver Sergio Turbo, alias the Third Turbo and the one from which Agent Sergio Turbo (Sixth Turbo) was cloned.<br><br>So, yes. In this story Sakura breaks up with Shaoran and now it&#39;s Third!Sergio&#39;s girlfriend. And this is the reason behind Sakura being Sixth!Sergio&#39;s LO. And why I had to put all those things around this story to prevend a dangerous collpasing of tons of canon.</p>

            <p>I will fix that misspelling. I only heard it spoken and didn&#39;t bother to look it up. Whoops.<br><br>I thought &quot;dwimmerlaik&quot; was particularly appropriate to the situation, given its original use and Arthas being what he is. Though, come to think of it, it&#39;s probably lucky that our agents aren&#39;t powerful enough to truly exorcise him of his canonical evil. That would have been really awkward. O.o<br><br>You have Barid to thank for the &quot;wrong target&quot; and the flirty dragon. The dragonhawk was a conjoined effort, I think, that came naturally out of discussions about character classes and attributes. Not to mention the fact that we talked about Ilraen&#39;s pet enough in the course of the mission. It was our Chekov&#39;s <s>dragonhawk</s> gun. {= )<br><br>The sign predated Agent Barid, but he certainly justifies its continued existence...<br><br>Glad you enjoyed. {= )<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>. . . who would play your agents? Would they (or the movie in general) fall victim to cliche, or could it rise above? What actress would you like to see cast as a Mary Sue, or would the Sues have to be entirely CGI-generated? Can even CGI create urple? Discuss.<br><br>Here&#39;s a little something to kick off the discussion. I have a sinking feeling that, however well-made (or not) the movie was, Agent Suicide would be played by the Rock. Is this a good thing? A bad thing? I don&#39;t know. But lack of detail makes PPC-era Suicide default to Bishonen Standard, and we already know the Rock can play long-haired aggressive ancient-world guys. <br><br>Just so long as it&#39;s not Robert Pattinson.</p>

            <p>Given the sheer mind-blowing scale of the PPC (does anyone have any idea about the total wordcount of all PPC-related materials to date?), I&#39;d say we&#39;re looking at a very long-running TV show here, not a movie. It&#39;d also fit the episodic format better, don&#39;t you think? (With the obvious exception of the Emergencies, which would be long-running arcs or season finales). And there&#39;s a mind-blowing number of actresses who could be Sues. However, does anyone else think that some Sues at least might be better played by really good actresses, sort of like the best tone-deaf singers are played by people who can actually sing so that they can screw up properly?</p>

            <p>It really is hard to screw-up on purpose. Reference the Fanfic land episode. It is hard to think like that purposefully. <br><br>I also think CGI would be best for the PPC.<br><br>Part of the humor for me comes from the fact that for us, as readers, these stories are very clearly framed. We make our agents miserable on a regular basis. How would we get across the idea that even thought the agents take themselves very seriously that the watchers should not take the whole very seriously--especially in a visual format where it is easier for the casual viewer to get attached to the characters and really into the world?</p>

            <p>I think the sheer absurdity of the situations, plus things like framing the shots and the nature of the special effects and the background music and so forth, might make it clear that things weren&#39;t serious. Sort of like, if there are any other Glee viewers here, you can pretty much always tell what moments are dramatic and what are comedic - the same signals for comedy would work in the PPC. <br><br>Also, I&#39;m not sure there&#39;s anything wrong with getting attached to the characters and world.

            <p>I don&#39;t watch Glee regularly, but that&#39;s true. The easiest way to make it clear whether a moment is comedy or not without changing anything in-universe is the soundtrack. One of the things I love about bad movies (I&#39;m thinking <i>Manos: The Hands of Fate</i>) is situationally-inappropriate music — I happen to think <i>Manos</i> has a nice-sounding soundtrack, but it&#39;s definitely not the right soundtrack for <i>Manos</i>.</p>

            <p>...Or made with CGI a la Avatar (only much better plotted, of course). That way, the Agents can be tailored to whatever standards we (alright, the directors) will. But, if I had to choosea person, it would probably be a young Edward Norton to play Julius, and...well, I can&#39;t think of a good actress for Leila off the top of my head and I just did a Google image search for &#39;actress&#39; and the results are 90% NSFW.<br><br>See, this is why I say CGI is the way to go. </p>

            <p>Animation would definitely be the way to go for the reason you mentioned. Character design could be more strictly controled than if you had a specfic actor playing the role.<br><br>Who could I see playing my characters? Following the animation road (so considering the actor&#39;s voices only) I&#39;d go with Tara Strong as Laura, Paul Rudd as Danny, and Emily Osment as Rachel.

            <p>There&#39;s way too much weird stuff in the PPC. Minis would have to be CGI, as well as heavy effects for portalling, Sue-spectrum colors, and stuff like Urple Clouds, Logic Loopholes, ANSpace, etc.<br><br>Also, the Agents themselves. Two of my conceptual Agents would have to be entirely CGI&#39;d--an Eagle á la Tolkien, and a Siu Riu from Temeraire. Of my other two, my Tayledras&#39; bondbird would need effects, and the other, from Garth Nix, has a pair of wings (magical constructs) that he wears whenever it&#39;s not absolutely necessary for him to remove them. They&#39;re not the only odd Agents...<br><br>Casting my vote for pure-CGI, in case I somehow failed to make that clear.</p>

Maryke Hendrikse or Lisa Ann Beley (Revy and Eda in <i> Black Lagoon </i>, respectively) would both make excellent Kimmie VAs, and Caitlin Glass (Haruhi of <i> Ouran</i> fame, and also apparently Winry Rockbell) would be a great Agent Caitlyn*.<br><br>*Yes, name retconned.</p>

            <p>But it&#39;s about fanfiction, so we&#39;d have copyright trouble if we made a real movie out of it, right?  Or would it be different because it&#39;s all about the fan treatment of something published?<br>I kind of think that there should be something different, unrealistic, about the suefic to represent its disconnect from reality.  But that would have to compare to something.  HQ isn&#39;t exactly in touch with reality, either, though I guess an RC would look lived-in and messy.  We&#39;d also have to represent the strange things that happen when a scene is described wrong.  I think there would be an good contrast if the agents and people not directly connected to the Sue, or a canon when the agents talk to them privately, could be shown as more real than the Sue and her immediate surroundings.<br>A glowing hot pink with a little bit of purple in it should work well enough as urple.<br>What would the Words look like?</p>

            <p>(not a lawyer)<br>Given that, as you say, it&#39;s about the fan treatment of published work, it might fall under a fair use clause, but we&#39;d probably need permission from the copyright owners of all the canons involved, as we are using their things.<br><br>As for distinguishing the Suefic from reality, perhaps we could have a slight gaussian blur over everything in the Suefic apart from the agents?

            <p>Then we could have some fun with textures and quality. I always pictured Suefics as sort of like those awful Poser fanarts--maybe technically detailed, but lifeless, hollow-eyed, and doll-like. Putting a real actor (or at least a very well-done CGI motion-capture of a real actor) alongside one of these monstrosities would hit the Uncanny Valley hard. Provided it&#39;s lampshaded by the agents or something, so the audience knows it&#39;s <i>intentionally</i> bad.</p>

            <p>Well, no Robert Pattinson as Suicide. I was having nightmares of &quot;Hollywood heartthrob&quot; getting cast in a role that&#39;s totally inappropriate for him, just because it would bring in the fangirls. But you&#39;ve got a good point--I do think he would enjoy being an agent, and it wouldn&#39;t surprise me if there was a place for him.</p>

            <p>If there is ever an ESAS movie, I think it would go something like this:<br><br>Logan: Ryan Reynolds. He has the try-hard, slightly-annoying flippant humour requirement down-pat, and even looks vaguely like him. Unfortunately, with Ryan Reynolds involved, I think cliche is unavoidable. Runner-up, Marshall Allman (who actually looks quite a lot like Logan).<br><br>Kern: Harder to cast. I think Paul Bettany is the closest match (but not particularly close). Hollywood doesn&#39;t have many blond 30-something actors, it seems. Or at least ones that could pass for Jedi. (Neil Patrick Harris as a Jedi? Awesome, but unlikely)<br><br>Iodin: Kate Beckinsale. If she can handle glowing blue vampire eyes, glowing red Chiss eyes (and blue skin) should be no problem.<br><br>Aegis: Katie Holmes (but she&#39;d need to grow her hair long again) <br><br>Sues: I think rotoscoped Beowulf-3D kind of thing. I think Sues need to have something CGI about them (even if it&#39;s CGI real actresses) so that they are in the &quot;uncanny valley&quot;. Megan Fox comes to mind as a possible Sue candidate.<br><br>Hmm, that would be an interesting movie. I think there might be some interesting performances from Kern and Iodin, but I fear that Logan and Aegis would bring the movie down somewhat. Ryan Reynolds and Katie Holmes do better in ironic roles, in my opinion.</p>

            <p>My inclination is to say that Sues would have to be CGI-generated. At the least, they would have to be Serkis Folk of some sort, just because many Sues would look so utterly inhuman in reality, if the movie takes Sue descriptions literally, which I assume it would if it wanted to be a proper representation of the PPC. Perhaps the more normal-looking ones could just be played by a beautiful actress (I&#39;m seeing Liv Tyler as fifty different extra daughters of Elrond), but having them as Serkis Folk would also make it possible to change their features enough that it was obvious that they were different characters (or as different as Sues get), and the PPC wasn&#39;t just fighting a collection of five women who won&#39;t stay dead despite having been chopped up into pieces and eaten/burned/drowned/etc.<br><br>I also think that the work of the assasins would probably end up getting toned down a lot if the film wasn&#39;t going to be rated through the roof, just because our good guys go around killing people for existing. I know and you know there&#39;s more to it than that, but if it&#39;s going to be aimed at people who don&#39;t know the PPC, that&#39;s what they&#39;ll see. Still, since there&#39;s no way any film would be able to show every single mission ever, they could end up picking the ones where the Sue&#39;s death was most obviously totally justified because she&#39;d performed some positively evil act. Mind you, this could probably be managed by showing the Sue-influence like demonic posession - make more use of the author-wraiths, perhaps? - to make it really obvious who the villain is and who the noble warriors standing up for all that&#39;s good without thanks or recognition are :P<br><br>Well, that was sufficiently rambling.</p>

            <p>Correct me if I&#39;m wrong, but aren&#39;t good actresses generally also good at hamming it up beyond all logic?

            <p>...I think that the world&#39;s still sort of shying away from the idea of homosexuals on earth. It&#39;s a rather touchy subject in some religions, and even in some countries.

            <p>Explain, please?  Are you having fun or did someone steal your identity?

But if the troll is an identity thief, that shows a certain level of intelligence, which I find frightening.  Is there any way to block people on this board?

            <p>but in reality he&#39;d just give you a look and start interrogating you on how a very random bystander knows anything about Treadstone. <br><br>Go ahead and draw it.

Nicky... yeah, they kind of have her offer support in a way that is disturbingly like the first movie- like Marie, she had just dyed her hair and it was possibly a coincidence on purpose- to show that Jason views her as something like Marie, and since Marie didn&#39;t end up so well... he doesn&#39;t want to start anything.

            <p>Is there anything besides the mega-crossover nature and the mini in the title (which is, admittedly, Very Bad, but could also be a don&#39;t-follow-the-fansubs-honey issue) to make you think this is sporkworthy? The TvTropes page seemed neutral-to-positive, which it usually isn&#39;t for badfic of the caliber we target, and last time I checked there were rules about labeling all of a genre as badfic. Rules to the general effect of &quot;don&#39;t.&quot;<br><br>I don&#39;t know the fandoms, but it seems like you&#39;re threatening death on rather slender grounds. A lot of the quoted lines seemed genuinely funny, and not funny in a so-bad-it&#39;s-good way either.</p>

            <p>Only the Vita-and-ice-cream thing sounds pretty awful. And as I read it the TvTropes page was mocking it, but I can&#39;t say - the author himself seems to be quite confused about why he wrote it.<br><br>However, searching badfic when you&#39;re tired is not a good idea XD</p>

            <p>Hijacking the thread for a moment:<br>Does a misspelled Sindarin word create a mini-Balrog, or is it only proper nouns and names of races? There weren&#39;t any examples in the new list, though there were some on Miss Cam&#39;s list, so I wanted to check.<br>(the word in question is elloth for ellon, or possibly elleth for the purposes of hilarity, though the author does seem to know how to spell that one.)</p>

            <p>Really? I guess I should have looked it up - never occured to me that it might itself be a legitimate Sindarin word. That gives me a new joke now, though, so that&#39;s good. Thanks for telling me :)<br><br>Ah, OK. I&#39;m not sure how or if I should address that in a mission, especially as my agents&#39;ll be be newbies and won&#39;t remember the Crashing Down, Macrovirus or 2008 Invasion crises. In fact, they may only have heard about the factories by rumour during their basic training. I was planning to just have them comment on the note saying she was a Factory Sue, wonder if they should worry about that and come to the conclusion that if so the mission brief would say more about it, even if just &#39;exercise caution&#39; or something. After that, I wasn&#39;t planning to mention it again.<br>Should I leave that fic for someone who knows more about Factory Sues and find another one? I don&#39;t want to screw up a long-standing part of PPC canon.</p>

            <p>First off, can you try to keep the new topics down? If you have stuff relating to the topic you first posted, post that as a reply, please. Each new topic you post shunts another one off the end of the Board into oblivion. Just saying before other people jump on it.<br><br>Secondly, Miss Cam is no longer involved with OFUs, minis or the PPC, and doesn&#39;t particularly want people contacting her about them. If you want to set up an OFU that the PPC recognises, most people these days just mention it to the Board and see what the response is - usually something along the lines of &quot;go ahead&quot;.<br><br>Mini-Balrogs, on the other hand, now have an official Adoptions Agency set up to handle them. I got permission to set it up and run it back in 2008. You send the minis there and I keep track of which ones are new, which have been found before, and which have/haven&#39;t been adopted yet. I also adopt them out. The Agency is <a href="http://c5s-ppc-agents.livejournal.com/6497.html">here</a>.<br><br>I can also tell you now that Eldorna, Agaorn and frandiul have already been found and adopted... several years ago,  by the look of it. You must have found a fairly old fic. Still, re-finding them is good of you, and if you send them along the Agency can send them back to their owners.</p>

            <p>Dear Ms. Cameron-Young,<br><br>Being a complete n00b when it comes to posting on forums,<br>I had no idea I was kicking other people&#39;s topics off the site.<br>I thought they were simply stored in an archive.<br>Otherwise, believe me, I would never have posted three topics myself.<br><br>Secondly, I thought the joke involving Miss Cam getting more mini-Balrogs inflicted on her was still circulating,<br>which is why I referred to her.

Sorry.<br><br>Finally, since I couldn&#39;t find the fics featuring Eldorna, Agaorn and the others on the PPC Wiki,<br>I assumed these fics had not yet been killed and the minis, therefore, had not yet been detected. Hence the post.<br><br>And oh, just so you don&#39;t think I feel &quot;insulted&quot; or anything, I&#39;m really grateful you pointed out my mistakes.<br>This will serve me well for future postings.<br><br>Respectfully,<br>Sister-to-the-Queen<br><br>PS: If the fics I&#39;m talking about have already been PPCed,<br>    please let me know.

The topics go back a fair way, but it&#39;s good to know these things.<br><br>Miss Cam&#39;s website where OFUM was hosted is still up, as far as I&#39;m aware, and the list of minis that had been found by the time she gave it up was there as well.

            <p>As my time as a member lengthens, I start to consider creating my agents. I have a couple of characters lined up (they&#39;re from one of my original universes), but I have a few questions about their suitability as agents. I thought I&#39;d ask them now so I don&#39;t waste everyone&#39;s time later.<br><br>1) Is it OK to use characters from an original universe? It&#39;s essentially World One, but with more magic, werewolves, vampires etc.<br><br>2) They&#39;re twin brother and sister (for the purposes of argument - it&#39;s actually more complicated than that). I&#39;ve seen married couples, but I haven&#39;t seen any sibling pairs as agents (apart from Rose/Ross, and it would be difficult for those two not to work together). Is the lack just because no-one writes them, or is there a PPC policy against it that I don&#39;t know about?<br><br>3) One of them is named Felagund. The newbie FAQ mentions that major canon characters who die in canon shouldn&#39;t be recruited, but he&#39;s not the original Finrod Felagund; he was created through a combination of over-zealous RPing and magic. However, since I&#39;m going to be killing Tolkien badfic, it might cause confusion.<br><br>If these guys aren&#39;t going to work, then no harm done, I&#39;ll use someone else. I&#39;d really like to use them, though.<br><br>Thanks!</p>

            <p>No one&#39;s complained so far about one of my agents. She&#39;s from an Modern Day World One original &#39;Verse much like yours, with magic, were-beings (though technically they&#39;re more shapeshifters, but I digress), vampires, and other assorted beasties. <br><br>Anyways, I have a question for you: Where in the general timeline of World One is your &#39;Verse set? What I mean is, is it more like modern-day times, medieval times, or something else? That might impact how your characters interact with the advanced tech the PPC has, and could prove to be a running gag/funny thing for your agents.</p>

            <p>It&#39;s basically modern day. There are some differences, but they&#39;re pretty minor. I only split it off from actually being set in our world recently, when I decided that some of the stuff going on was just a bit too weird (another major character is an anthro werewolf pop star, vampire attacks are a bit too common to just be ignored, and Jackson&amp;Felagund (back when it was one person with a split personality gone out of control) had an epic battle with an old school aquaintance who had been posessed by demons). The internet is less of a thing, though - it stayed mostly reserved for big universities and the military, and fanfic is mostly in &#39;zines, but the publication of these has become increasingly easy and popular, so their &#39;verse has its share of mass-consumed bad fanfic. Also, fangirl Latin is a common thing (some pretentious idiot started it and it caught on among other people who wanted to look clever, and spread to most of fandom).<br>I already had Felagund being really uncomfortable reading anything he can&#39;t hold, while Jackson took to it like a duck to water, being generally more technologically-minded. I might do some more work on their home &#39;verse, though (which I need to do anyway), and look for more things like that. Thanks!<br><br>Your &#39;verse sounds fun, though, and certainly better developed than mine. I&#39;m glad to hear there are others like these two around, and their origins, at least, shouldn&#39;t be a problem. :)</p>

            <p>1) From what I&#39;ve heard that&#39;s fine, and even if it isn&#39;t, that sort of original fiction universe isn&#39;t too hard to come by and I&#39;m sure you could foist them over to a canonverse if you really wanted to. <br><br>2) Weeell, it&#39;s PPC policy to have agents be a sort of &#39;odd couple&#39;, and that might be rather difficult with twins, but...If you think you can make it work, that&#39;s fine by me, anyway.<br><br>3) That is basically the same backstory as Dafydd Illian, one of our most well-known agents.

            <p>1) OK :)<br><br>2) Hmm... I think I can pull it off. They do have fairly different personalities and possibly the biggest effects of them being twins are extreme physical resemblance and knowing one another&#39;s body language very well.<br><br>3) *headdesk* I... confess that I had momentarily forgotten Dafydd Illian. Mea maxima culpa! But Maglor wasn&#39;t his most commonly-used name, he always went by Daffyd. Would that make any difference, do you think?<br>(Now I&#39;m nervous of being accused of backstory-theft)</p>

            <p>Is often appreciated. It does save confusion.<br><br>Also, if the original world he&#39;s from is something you&#39;re thinking of maybe publishing someday, that&#39;s another good reason to think of a different name.

            <p>Yeah, as soon as he became an actual character rather than just a nickname (as part of a fantasy book club), I knew their story could never be published. Part of why I wanted to use them as agents :)<br><br>I can try to think of a new name for him, though - something similar; he&#39;s firmly entrenched as Felagund in my head, as is his sister&#39;s habit of adressing him as Fel, and his hatred of that nickname.

            <p>Stop double-posting. It&#39;s considered rude, as you keep bumping other people&#39;s threads off the page.  This one is just annoying, because it&#39;s the exact same as your first post. <br>But on the other hand, welcome to the board.  We&#39;re all a bit mad here, so we don&#39;t mind a bit of insanity and we definitely like people who&#39;ve read the original LotR series.  (By the way, who do you ship in there, if at all?  And are you a Legolas fangirl?)<br>So, reiterating another line:  welcome to the board, and have a random heavy object.

            <p>Like everyone else, I agree that the mission was fun, not boring, and the swear jar is an excellent idea. Of course it would be Bleeprin.

            <p>Is it one fic with elements of <i>Alien</i> AND <i>Predator</i>? In that case, it&#39;s a crossover, and it goes in Crossovers.<br><br>If it&#39;s something actually based on <i>Alien vs. Predator</i>, I would guess that gets its own category in either Films or Video Games, depending on which iteration the fic is based on.<br><br>If you&#39;ve got two fics, one in <i>Alien</i> and one in <i>Predator</i>, each fic goes in its own category in Films (probably). If the categories for the specific movies aren&#39;t there at the moment, just add them--but make sure they&#39;re in alphabetical order.<br><br>On a completely unrelated note, why the random line breaks? The text box you type into will wrap your lines automatically, and it doesn&#39;t reflect the width of the page once you post anyway, so it&#39;s not like there&#39;s no room for a long, continuous line.

            <p>Actually, since both the <i>Aliens</i> and <i>Predator</i> comics exist in the same universe, and crossover frequently, I  don&#39;t think it&#39;d be any more of a crossover than a Superman/Batman fic if it was one story based on the comic &#39;verse.<br><br>It all depends on where the story was on ff.net, I suppose.</p>

            <p>...to have enough canon breaking elements in a couple of chapters to justify killing it. It isn&#39;t so much the actual word count, as the content. <br><br>I&#39;ve done at least one story that was less than 1000 words, but still managed to have enough in it to kill it. I&#39;ve done one that was over 25,000 words that I had to send my agents through the entire thing to get that final charge. Well, it was actually killable by about 15,000 words, but it had major charges at the very end, too.</p>

            <p>I have that problem too, sometimes, but it&#39;s not plagerism, especially if you credit. Usually if I&#39;m in your place I try to re-write so as to make it wholly mine, but sometimes a line is just too good - then I credit it and call it a homage. No one minds. </p>

            <p>My agents:<br><br><b>Name:</b> Surhat Roac sw Caun (Surhat)<br><b>Species:</b> human<br><b>Home Continuum:</b> my NaNoWriMo novel for the coming november<br><b>Department:</b> Department of Floaters<br><b>Background:</b> Surhat sw Caun, a minor apprentice wizard, was drawn out of his home continuum during a fight to prevent power-hungry master wizards from breaking the boundaries between worlds, and he was deposited in the middle of headquarters, unable to return to his home continuum. As a result, he has a strong dislike of those who meddle with reality, whether they be Mary Sues or slash-spirits. He is occasionally arrogant, as befits a young member of House Roac, and is prone to daydreaming, but he makes an effort to be personable. He is a stickler for spelling, as he believes it to be one of the things that most erodes the walls between worlds. He does not, however, have a very wide knowledge of World One canons. Somehow, despite being forbidden from re-entering his home continuum, he manages to keep himself supplied with his family&#39;s cocoa powder for making hot chocolate.<br><b>Skills:</b> minor spellcasting abilities (I&#39;ve got a list of the D&amp;D 3.5 spells that is roughly equivalent to what he knows, if anyone cares deeply; it&#39;s only eighteen spells), was taught to use a knife and fire a bow when he was younger, but had not used those skills in at least five years until his recent recruitment<br><b>Weapons:</b> knowledge; also a House Roac knife, an old family heirloom, which he carries but rarely uses if he can avoid it. His magic is not really suitable for combat.<br><b>Appearance:</b> Surhat&#39;s home is high in the mountains of the north — he and his family are all Scandinavian in appearance, blond-haired and blue-eyed. Their chocolate is grown in greenhouses maintained by magic. Surhat&#39;s eyes are a particularly dark blue, and his hair has darkened somewhat since has been spending more time inside headquarters. Despite its apparent impracticality, he does not feel comfortable unless he is wearing a scholar&#39;s robe over his PPC uniform. He claims he can hide things in the sleeves, but he has not had the opportunity to demonstrate this as yet.<br><br><b>Name:</b> Roger Walters<br><b>Species:</b> werewolf<br><b>Home Continuum:</b> Earth, Not World One<br><b>Department:</b> Department of Floaters<br><b>Background:</b> Roger Walters&#39;s world is very much like World One, save that it contains werewolves. And some other things, but they are tales for another time. Since this is Not Your Average Modern Fantasy, Roger&#39;s world&#39;s particular form of lycanthropy imposes a variety of vulnerabilities on the human forms of those with its curse: being burned by metals; poisoned, balked, or otherwise influenced by various herbs; etc. Roger has always been an avid reader of everything and occasional writer of fanfic. At some point when he was exploring his grandparents&#39; house, he found a door that opened into a response center. He picked up the PPC Manual sitting on the floor therein, read it through, and knew he had found his calling. He somehow made his way to Personnel and got himself hired, with a few days off before he officially went on duty to sort out his Not World One affairs. Quoth his sister, incredulously: &quot;You&#39;re going to save fictional worlds from bad fanfiction?&quot; Quoth Roger, sarcastically: &quot;This from the girl who turns into a wolf at the full moon.&quot; Quoth his parents, resignedly: &quot;Call us when you get the chance, then.&quot;<br><b>Skills:</b> plant identification (occasionally vital for his survival), knowledge of a wide range of fandoms (some of which do not exist in World One). In theory, he could learn to voluntarily transform into a hybrid man-wolf state, but without a teacher it is unlikely he will develop this skill, as he is not (currently) aware that it is possible.<br><b>Weapons:</b> although he keeps meaning to find someone to teach him some basic combat skills, Roger&#39;s current preferred weapon is punching people in the face. It&#39;s worked OK so far.<br><b>Appearance:</b> brown hair, blue eyes, wears jeans and a t-shirt more or less every day, usually carrying a book. Due to his vulnerability to metal, Roger always wears gloves to avoid burning himself while, for example, opening a door. Interestingly, these vulnerabilities seem to disappear when he is in a disguise generated by PPC machinery. From moonrise to moonset on the night of the full moon, he becomes an ordinary gray wolf, losing all awareness of his human self. Generally he is locked up at these times.<br><br>My theory is that Surhat&#39;s patience and slight age advantage will balance out Roger&#39;s tendency to rush into things (as evidenced by his recruitment by the PPC); by the same token, Roger&#39;s knowledge of a wide range of canons will balance out the fact that Surhat had not heard of any of the canons the PPC works in until he arrived in HQ, though he has now read some of the most popular book canons.<br><br>The story I intend to kill: I think I&#39;ll start with <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/1111233/1/To_live_serve_a_purpose_and_die_alone">To live, serve a purpose, and die alone</a><br>&quot;let&#39;s go to meat her&quot;<br>&quot;No-one knows or cares about how I&#39;m feelings!&quot;<br><br>Writing sample option #3 (there are two other samples on the site if anyone&#39;s inclined to look at them): <a href="http://lleullawgyffes.livejournal.com/1622.html">Roger Walters&#39;s Job Interview</a><br>I don&#39;t really have any fanfic to show off (unless you read Klingon, as mentioned a few days ago), except insofar as the two PPC stories on the Livejournal count.</p>

            <p>I noticed some misplaced italic tags, and there are a couple of places where you slip into Roger&#39;s thoughts without marking them, but that&#39;s easily fixed.

            <p>Is that Roger seems to know that being a werewolf is strange.  Does that mean they&#39;re pretty rare in his world?  If they&#39;re common, why does he equate being a werewolf with going into fictional stories and killing fanfic characters?<br>It&#39;s picky, but it&#39;s the sort of thing I always notice. Sorry.

            <p>that is considerate of their special needs, that implies it&#39;s sort of common. At least more common than that Roger doesn&#39;t know any other werewolves. He may have met some visiting the school on an open day.</p>

            <p>You are correct that he probably met some others when visiting — I hadn&#39;t thought of that. Labrador College of Arts and Science is an accredited university and has primarily non-werewolf students (which makes sense, given the number of werewolves relative to non-werewolves), but it is known to werewolves for being werewolf-friendly (i.e. there are facilities for containing them at the full moon, it&#39;s low on metal, food does not come with garlic or mint, etc.), so most werewolves of college age in North America who are aware of it and interested in college end up either going there or seriously considering it. I am not sure (yet) whether the non-werewolf students are told about their fellow students&#39; &quot;special needs&quot;, as it were.<br><br>I hope that explanation made sense.</p>

            <p>Anyone here ever do one of those memes where you assign ten characters a number, then do mini-fics for prompts along the lines of &quot;1 and 2, such-and-such&quot;?

            <p>Number one: a Card Captor Sakura mini is a mini-Guardian. However, I made the mini I found in my mission with an angel-like appearance (as Yue), but later I discovered that the minis found in two previous mission in the same continuum were described as being more like Cerberos/Kero-chan in &quot;standby&quot; form (plushie-toy like) Now, what I should do?<br><br>Two: in the title of a fic I thought was a badfic (it was probably more like a parody) there was a Nanoha Takamichi. Since the right name is Nanoha Takamachi, it should be a mini. Can I keep it even if there isn&#39;t going to be a mission about the story? I already have Sakura Kiminoto (right surname Kinomoto) from a TvTropes article, but about the second I was going to use it as a gag in my next mission.<br>However, i don&#39;t know if it is better to have Nanoha Takamichi shaped as an Unison Device (so it would be something like a doll, being Unison Devices just like an human in appereance but six inches tall), or as a ferret (only animal with some importance in the series, since one of the characters can morph into one). However, if I can keep both minis as human-shaped I would be happier.</p>

            <p>I know, the official mini for the Harry Potter universe is a mini-acromantula. However I am arachnofobic and my agent &quot;inherited&quot; this trait from me. Would it be possible to change the fandom mini to eg. mini-thestral in my fics?</p>

            <p>One, rewrite your mission to either change the appearance of the mini or explain why/make note of the fact minis in this fandom take different shapes.<br><br>Two, I think you can. Tawaki brings minis to the board a lot more often than mission plugs. If anything there is precedence.<br><br>I have no idea about the fandom you are talking about here, all I can say is: unless on the wiki the shape of the minis is already determined and rule of funny can&#39;t be applied, you can chose what you want.</p>

            <p>Ok, so Nanohaverse minis will be a mini-Unison Device. I can use it for some funny dialogues, since one of my agents actually IS a true Unison Device.<br><br>About the mini-Guardians, I will write soon an article about rhem with an explanation for that. In fact, Angel-shaped and Beast-shaped guardians differ only in shape, being both magical constructs with the same powers, and since are always in a &quot;set&quot; of two, one of each kind, it&#39;s quite a natural fact that also mini-Guardians can exist in both shapes.</p>
