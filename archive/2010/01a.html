            <p>We&#39;ve been a bit slack over the past few months, we admit, but we&#39;ve come to make it up to everyone with some newly completed Bad Slash missions :)<br><br>Both are NSFW, as usual.<br><br>The first: <a href="http://rc45.dreamwidth.org/110536.html"><a href="http://rc45.dreamwidth.org/110536.html">http://rc45.dreamwidth.org/110536.html</a></a> - &#39;Lady Light Skirt&#39;, rated R, Mpreg, BBC Merlin.

Costarring Mpreg Agents Oscar and Iza.<br><br>IMPORTANT WARNING: This fic contains graphic non-con. We&#39;ve taken out most of it, as we usually do, but for those of delicate dispositions, we warn you.<br><br>The second: <a href="http://rc45.dreamwidth.org/110814.html"><a href="http://rc45.dreamwidth.org/110814.html">http://rc45.dreamwidth.org/110814.html</a></a> - &#39;I Will Never Stop Loving You&#39;, rated PG, fluff, BBC Robin Hood.

            <p>I&#39;ve never seen Merlin, but I tend to react with sharp point objects to fics that have canonically strong male characters break down in tears ever few moments. Maybe because I used to do it myself, and so know how hard it is to resist temptation. Thus, I suppose in my eyes it&#39;s the sign of inexperienced and lazy authors manipulating my emotions. -shrugs- It makes sense in my head. Anyway, glad you all got that sorted. <br><br>At least the Robin Hood one was better about that.

            <p>I was led to the webcomic &quot;Jack&quot; by a bad review, and still agree with several of the points from it (all the ones which *didn&#39;t* blatantly show that the critic hadn&#39;t actually read more than about three pages, which he clearly hadn&#39;t, but still made one or two valid points - why the heck DID that kid randomly bring a gun to school with him on the day the other kid just happened to go on a killing spree?), but grew to like it anyway.

            <p>He&#39;s established to be a kid, which would make being an undercover police officer rather unlikely.  That said...<br><br>Before the late 1980s (and even more so before the mid-1960s), having firearms inside schools in the United States was not as unusual a situation as it is today. For a while there were still rural schools where, during hunting season, it was not unusual to simply have rifles carried around in the halls and stored in lockers during classes, and today those same areas will often have high school students simply store them in car trunks in the parking lot.  One discussion of such is available <a href="http://74.125.47.132/search?q=cache:ubPzCYZFRQ4J:backwoodshome.com/blogs/MassadAyoob/2009/10/14/win-a-few-%E2%80%A6-lose-a-few/+students+used+to+put+rifles+in+lockers+hunting+season&amp;cd=10&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us&amp;client=firefox-a">here</a>, if I got my link formatting right.  It&#39;s currently unlawful in nearly all situations, but that doesn&#39;t necessarily stop people from doing it.  Joel Myrick&#39;s 1997 actions would be one example of this.<br><br>Some rural (and rare suburban) schools also have have rifle teams, both air rifle and .22s.  These are steadily being scaled down or outright removed, but you can find them places where they&#39;d not be expected still.  While the firearms here technically must be locked up pretty well or constantly supervised, the situation in the second arc would probably cause most people to reconsider.  There are also occasionally trusted students who... ahem... &#39;accidentally&#39; get access to the key or combination to these firearms.<br><br>It&#39;s still a pretty decent level of improbability, but not a matter of complete randomness.</p>

            <p>You know what? I read the comic and though that was strange... <br><br>I still like &#39;Jack&#39;, mainly because it&#39;s well, interesting. Sure, there are a few things about it that are confusing, but art&#39;s good, the religous undertones (this IS a comic about Heaven and Hell, after all), aren&#39;t forced onto the reader, and if you&#39;re like me, you&#39;ll enjoy seeing the bad guys get their comuppance.</p>

            <p>Nah its fine, the worst you&#39;ll hear is people bemoaning it.<br><br>I like the first Book of Inheritance but when the second came out it was like... he was trying too hard. <br><br>And with Twilight I was sucked into THAT little whirlpool of obsession until I read Breaking dawn. And then I said &#39;what was I thinking&#39; and moved on. Thankfully I only purchased the books and not any merchandise. my Twilight books now reside in the Attic never to be touched again. The Twilight movie (haven&#39;t seen 2) only cemented that fact.</p>

            <p>But it brought out the WORST parts of the book. It was like it was done by guys holding up card-board cut-outs of the actors. In fact the acting might have been done better if it HAD been done by card-board cut-outs. But the riff-trax (same guys who did MST3K) of it was brilliant. Worth the $4.</p>

            <p>I too read and tolerated Twilight. Well, up until the release of <i>Breaking Dawn,</i> after which point I examined them again and decided that I had better things to squee over in my spare time. But I still enjoy twisting the characters until they break (have I mentioned anywhere yet that I&#39;m a sadistic author?), which, for me, is a mark of affection. If we can like Twilight, you can like Eragon. &#39;Sides, <i>someone</i> has to agree to work in that canon, and you seem to be the only candidate.<br><br>--anamia</p>

            <p>So, um, I don&#39;t have an Internet connection at home right now. And probably won&#39;t for a couple of weeks, maybe more, depending on how things go. I don&#39;t plan to vanish entirely, as there are a couple of places nearby where I can gank a free connection (which is what I&#39;m doing now), but my activity will definitely be curtailed for the duration.<br><br>That said, I&#39;m calling on my fellow Permission Givers to step up. hS I know is having computer troubles, and I know Araeph is around--but Dann, Laburnum? You guys are out there, aren&#39;t you? I&#39;d appreciate it if you guys would help keep an eye on that FAQ thread down the Board, not to mention the History article that it&#39;s spawned already.<br><br>THAT said, if it happens that we need/want more PGs around, I nominate Sedri and Trojie. Yes, I know you have said you don&#39;t want it. I don&#39;t care. In fact, that&#39;s partly why I think you&#39;d be good choices. {= p But it&#39;s up to the Board as a whole to decide what to do with this, if anything.<br><br>On a completely different note, I hope to need a beta-reader or two for a Derik-and-Earwig mission pretty soon. Knowledge of canon is not particularly necessary, but it&#39;s set in a Super Smash Brothers fic in which the OC is a huge Gary-Stu, and he drags Harry Potter along for the ride. It&#39;s pretty short by my standards, since very little actually happens in the fic. Any takers?<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>As far as I&#39;m aware, and I&#39;m most familiar with the word from Red Dwarf, it *does* mean that particular substance. <br><br>I recall seeing an interview with Craig Charles and Chris Barrie in which they recounted an amusing story from being on a panel at a convention: a small boy asked them &#39;what does &#39;smeg&#39; mean?&#39; and Chris Barrie actually crawled off stage rather than answer him. </p>

            <p>Smeg sounds like a rude word to me, but that&#39;s because it&#39;s used as one on Red Dwarf.<br><br>For future reference, sod and bugger mean the same thing. Think the act of buggery and the sin of Sodom. Hence it&#39;s weird, as Trojie says, that sod isn&#39;t considered a bad word at all.</p>

A community would be a thousand times easier - that&#39;s why they exist.<br><br>I realise a lot of people (myself included) want to post missions on their own journals; fine, no worries. But how about making cross-posts to the PPC community(/ies) for missions and the like so that we actually do have a useable alert system for any new missions?

I&#39;m going to start by making a master post for all my existing missions, so that there&#39;s some place other than my directory and our Wiki from which they can be found.<br><br>It would be very much appreciated if the rest of you could do the same, at least for all new missions.<br><br><br><br>(Also, on a more random note, why <i>are</i> there two different communities?)</p>

            <p>I was going to start a system, but got called away. Perhaps missions should be filed by author? And department, and fandom?

Then Voldemort...*SPOILER ALERT* massacres every living being in Hogwarts, in an event known as the Hogwarts Massacre. Anyways, the war drags on for another ten or twenty years, until Harry the elder comes up with a spell to send his soul/memory/magic back in time, so that he can fix things, and make everything right this time around.<br>It&#39;s definitely worth the week or so of reading it&#39;ll take to get through all of it. Think there could be an article in the making for it?<br>-Honu_Wahine</p>

            <p>Generally we only make wiki articles for goodfics so legendary that most everyone knows about and has already read them - the kind that come up in discussions or are referenced in puns or missions and which some people might need a wiki article or link to explain. After all, there&#39;s pleanty of goodfic around, and we can&#39;t make articles for all of them.<br><br>That said, it sounds interesting. When I have a week free, I&#39;ll take a look ;)</p>

            <p>Eh. *I* think it&#39;s epic. Whether anyone else does is up to them. He keeps forgetting a hell of a lot of commas, but overall, the story&#39;s still really awesome. It took me about a month and half of trawling the load of crap in the Harry Potter archive on ff.net to find it... To steal someone&#39;s signature on DevArt-- &quot;Finding a good fic is like looking for change in a sewer. You know it&#39;s there, but you have to go through a lot of crap to find it.&quot;<br>It doesn&#39;t have to have an article. It was just a random suggestion brought on by the anti-biotics.

            <p>I can give background on the basic idea of power rangers and more specific detail about a couple of the seasons. <br><br>Bronwyn, you&#39;re basically correct. -grins- At the beginning of every season there is the Evil Bad Guy Alien Person Thing who wants to take over the world. Good Guy Mentor Person selects a group of teenagers, sometimes based on their abilities and sometimes by accident and turns them into power rangers. Sometimes the new rangers have issues morphing their first time (forgetting words, somehow not magically knowing the gesture they need, etc.) but it always goes away after the first time. After that they never forget again. Once the team has formed, one of the first things they do is acquire zords, which are robots that they can ride and in which they fight. The shape of the zord depends on the theme of the team. (So, the Dino Thunder rangers have dinosaur zords, and the SPD team has police vehicles and so on). The zords are either given to them or freed from the forces of the Evil Bad Guy Alien Person. These zords can combine to form megazords, which the rangers use to fight aliens whom they&#39;ve already defeated but which have been resurrected and blown up to GOdzilla-like proportions by the Evil Bad Guy Alien Person or his/her minions.<br><br>Basically, the theme of the shows are always the power of teamwork and perseverance. Traditionally the teams don&#39;t get along too well at first, but then bond as they realize that they can&#39;t survive without each other. It&#39;s all very sticky sweet and filled with in your face morals. As the show increases they all get power boosts until, by the end, they&#39;ve become ridiculously strong. Of course, so has the enemy, so they still lose as often as they did before. <br><br>About getting their butts kicked: the best way to tell that they&#39;ll defeat the monster this episode is if they lose spectacularly to it early on. Sure sign that they will prevail. On the other hand, if they seem to be doing well, chances are it will be whisked away and saved for another episode, where it&#39;ll be stronger or some such thing.<br><br>Red is always a guy and always the leader, yes. Pink and yellow tend to be girls, and in Ninja Storm the sky blue ranger (just called blue in the show) is a girl. <br><br>Can&#39;t think of anything else, especially not having read the fic. What season of power rangers is it for, anyway?<br><br>Sorry for the essay. I like to be thorough and I get carried away at times.<br><br>--anamia</p>

            <p>I think I watched that show up through the Lost Galaxy season, which I still remember as having the best plot out of all of them.  A lot of people teased me for watching it, including my MOM once!  However, I was able to look past the fairly dorky special effects to the much better scripts and acting.<br><br>Also, Bulk and Skull are just the most perfect names for bullies ever.</p>

            <p>I think the early disagreements on the team started with Lost Galaxy The MMPR team were all friends before they were selected, and the replacements were generally accepted pretty quickly and easily. (In the show at least. Let&#39;s not get into the Kat vs Kimberly thing.) Then again, before Lost Galaxy the most team members replaced at once was four, and it tended to be the powers that changed rather than the team members. <br><br>As for the fic... it seems to be an SPD fic. Using a non-canon A-D squads. And all the rangers seem to be siblings or offspring of canonical Rangers, from MMPR to OO.</p>

            <p>The most I saw of power rangers was when it was before a show I wanted to watch so I&#39;d have to watch the last 2-3 minutes while waiting for animanics or the angry beavers (awesome shows, by the way).<br><br>But the fans got really obsessive. I had to buy a birthday gift for my cousin and I thought &#39;ah-ha! Power rangers!&#39;. I still have the scar where a kid bit me to get the red action figure.</p>

I give you a Capillary Towel and a hairpin with <i>For Official PPC Business Only</i> stamped on it.

Our most valuable resource is the <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/PPC_Wiki">PPC Wiki</a>, which is always growing and usually reliable. If you intend to write PPC missions of your own someday, please read the <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Permission">Permission article</a> thoroughly, and make a point of chatting with us around here for the next few weeks - don&#39;t be shy; we don&#39;t bite. Also, it is expected that you will have read the <a href="http://www.misssandman.com/PPC/story.html">Original PPC Series</a>, which just happens to be great fun as well as important. <br>A word of caution - every so often, some cheeky sod will try to goad you into reading a <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Legendary_badfic">Legendary Badfic</a>.

Can it be a short story about the Agent or the Agent&#39;s recruitment story, or anything completely unrelated to the PPC?<br>Heheh.

This was written for a writing contest at school, but for some reason, it was never reviewed by my English teacher for admittance to the contest<br>                             _ _ _ <br><br>Excerpt from the memoirs of a Space Marine circa 2017--<br><br>Love.<br>It is one word, four letters, one syllable. It has so many meanings. It can be platonic, it can be passionate, or it can be lustful. Love can move mountains and start wars.<br>Love is defined as a profoundly tender, passionate affection for another person. Love is an emotion, one of the most powerful ones that we, as humans, can experience. So often though, we lock it away, never to be seen or used.<br>A lot of the time, it is easier not to love. Love can cause you immeasurable pain. Hatred, rage and anger, though? Those are safe emotions.<br>Those three emotions can be controlled, focused and directed safely.<br>But love? Love is unpredictable. Love is a wild horse- it can hurt you more than any physical wound ever could. I’ve seen so many broken hearts after the air raid sirens die, or a patrol returns to base. So many of us never come back these days, and we leave our friends and our lovers behind.<br>Some days, I feel inordinately guilty. I have my lover, a doctor, who stays safe at the base.<br>I have a lover who isn’t likely to die anytime soon. I love him for it, and at the same time resent him for his safety. He has a permanent post at the base, behind the walls, and I’m almost always on the front lines, buried up to my neck in blood, water, and mud.<br>Who do you love? Do you hold them close at night, praying that you go first?<br>Do you love them as much as I love my doctor?<br>He is a medic, all of twenty one years old. I am a soldier, who has no business being in a relationship with him. Back on Earth, if she had never fallen prey to outside forces and our government’s shortsightedness, we might never have met. Back on Earth, my handsome lover would have a line of men and women falling at his feet, and I would have been miles away in another country. It’s funny what an interstellar war will do to you.<br>Yet, despite all of this, he chooses to spend his time with me, whenever I can be at the base.<br>I love him with all of my heart, but does he love me back? Or is our tryst merely a game or a joke to him?<br>Is it a game to him? Is he in love with me, or am I to be cast aside when someone new catches his fancy?<br>I am seventeen. My barracks chief says that he will kill my lover the next time that he sneaks into the barracks to spend the night. I worry that someday the Chief will carry through with his threat.<br>How much do you care for your lover, or spouse? Would you storm the gates of hell itself for them? I would. Would you die for your lover? I love him so much that it sometimes becomes so painful. I would breach the gates of hell to bring him home, and I would die for him. Of that, there is no doubt in my mind on the matter.<br>Does he love me as I love him?<br>Love: a feeling of intense desire and attraction toward a person with whom one is disposed to make a pair; the emotion of sex and romance. I read that definition once. It is that emotion, and others, that I direct towards my older lover.<br>Would you stay in a relationship, knowing that at any moment, you could die? Will you die next to your lover, watching their life bleed out of their eyes, even as yours leaves you?<br>I would. I would stay in the relationship, come hell or high water. I would die beside my lover. I would follow my heart, even as I pour my soul into these pages, knowing that he might one day see them- perhaps the day that I die protecting the last sorry dregs of humanity from the aliens.<br>We humans are slaves to our emotions, that much is true. It doesn’t matter if you are black, white, yellow, or bright green with black spots; we are all controlled by them. They dictate our lives according to their whims, even as we try to fight them.<br>I will forever be a slave to my passions. I will be a willing slave to them, even as I fight them.<br>Even as I sit here in the mud, rain pouring down my back, writing these words down, I stop myself from eating my gun. I love my partner too much to commit that kind of treason, to myself and my people.<br>Someday, I will confess my soul to him, but until that day, I’ll sit here in the mud, writing in this journal.<br>Perhaps someday, I won’t have to shoulder my gun anymore, or pull on a mask that turns me into a faceless protector of humanity, and settle down.<br>Love: A deep, tender, ineffable feeling of affection and solicitude toward a person, such as that arising from kinship, recognition of attractive qualities, or a sense of underlying oneness.<br>This is all that I fell when I think of Andy, this and more. I keep his picture folded into my breast pocket, and look at it to remind me why I stay on the front lines.<br>How much do you care for your lover? Will you die protecting them, will you face down the devil’s spawn that I fight ever day to protect them?<br>I care for him so much. I will die protecting him; I will face down a horde of the devil’s spawn and more to keep him safe.<br>No one can tell me that I take foolish risks. I am ruled by my emotions, and I cannot lock them away, merely bury them as best I can. I cannot force myself to become a creature of cold unloving stone. Many others have hardened their hearts to the world; others have merely walked out of the base, and never returned.<br>There is so much heartbreak here on this planet. It’s an unruly pisshole, but at least we can call it ours. The heartbreak can become unbearable at times. I believe that maybe if we had had forewarning, we could have saved our homeland. But we didn’t and now we are dying by the dozens.<br>We create, we survive, we adapt. We do these things, and we survive to keep on living as human beings. We aren’t animals, although some of the men and women that I fight alongside make me wonder, and we become.<br>I am in love, and I know that it is love, not lust.<br>***<br>That piece was a little existentialist, and probably more than a little bizzare — but it is one of my better pieces of short original fiction.

            <p>Nice work :)  I particularly like your use of dictionary definitions intercutting with emotive dialogue, and I like how much I was able to feel along with the character without ever knowing a thing about him-or-her.<br><br>One thing - you may want to add a little more depth to your agent&#39;s profile - not much, just a few comments that make him (her?) more than a statistic. What kind of fic did SAMS come from? What fandom? What are her (I&#39;ll go with her, given the use of &quot;Sue&quot; and not &quot;Stu&quot;) main characteristics or quirks? What lingering effects of her Sueish past does she struggle with, or what sort of quirks does she have that will make her an interesting character to read and write? <br><br>On a different note, if &quot;SAMS&quot; (or, heaven forbid, &quot;S.A.M.S&quot;) the &quot;name&quot; you intent to write with, I suggest forming some kind of nickname very soon, because all caps and acronyms are rather tiresome to read (let alone write) throughout a story. <br><br>I would also <i>not</i> suggest having only one agent - I&#39;ve tried it, and writing missions with only one agent is, frankly, boring as well as hard. I think the Flowers have something against it, too - if an agent loses their temper and there&#39;s no one around to hold them back, things can get very ugly. We (including you) are here for comedic entertainment, and a one-man show - even if it&#39;s a snarky MST of the badfic - is just never as good as a banter between two, especially if they&#39;re polar opposites. <br><br>That said, don&#39;t let me get you down! I like your writing style and I think you will do pretty well, but the PGs will likely give you similar replies, so if I tell you in advance, you can expand your agent profile now, before they see it. Gives a good impression ;)</p>

            <p>Okay, thanks Sedri.<br>My primary agent goes by &quot;hey you,&quot; or &quot;Sam,&quot; depending on how much trouble she&#39;s in, or how urgent the situation is.<br>Her SuePer powers are everything that a &#39;sue has in spades, as long as no one points out what she&#39;s doing. She runs experiments when she&#39;s not doing missions(often on her partner as well), to see if &quot;Major Dad&quot; was right, and you *can* actually get sloshed on soda pop.<br>Sam spent two years learning to manipulate plotholes(although it hasn&#39;t exactly worked out very well), after the &#39;fic she was in dumped her there for a vacation. She had just returned from a time-travel joyride with nine or ten other authors to 1943, and had just been debriefed by the CIA. Q, or someone pretending to be Q, dumped her in said plothole. What little sanity she had after spending time in close quarters with the cast of Hogan&#39;s Heroes quickly dissapeared after her two-year plothole exile.<br>My secondary agent:<br><br>Agent Sidhe<br>Species: Elf, a la Dragon Age<br>Age: On a technicality, still Jailbait(17).<br>Height: 5&#39;5&quot; Weight: 118 lbs<br>Hair: black, shoulder length braid<br>Eyes: green w/ gold flecks<br>Department: Department of Floaters<br>Division: none<br>Previous partner: none<br>Partner: SAMS(aka Sam)[adendum to first post, Sams&#39;s partner is Sidhe]<br>Weapon(s): saxe and a short knife; rapier; Mongolian recurved composite bow<br>Response Center: 1943<br>Fandoms: Dragon Age, Hogan&#39;s Heroes, Star Trek, X-Men, Warcraft and LOTR<br>Quirks/Other annoying habits:<br>Sidhe is a fairly well-balanced and grounded individual(at least when compared to his partner). He has a fondness for orange drinks, particularly orange juice. He lusts after elves, both male and female, and takes particular/personal offense when an author screws with said elves. When he isn&#39;t on missions, doing target practice, or assissting Sam with various bits of theft or other illegal activities, he is often found reading an original copy of &quot;Le Morte D&#39;Arthur&quot; or the &quot;Legacy of Aldenata&quot; series by John Ringo. He finds human failures extremely hillarious, and likes to mock authors of badfic at every opportunity. When he&#39;s not doing one of the those activities, he&#39;s being used in the sodapop-can-get-you-sloshed experiment with Sam.<br><br>-Honu_Wahine</p>

            <p>Okay, that&#39;s helpful, especially the names, but now I&#39;ll warn you not to go too far in the other direction - don&#39;t make Sam too speshul or powerful, or you will be denied Permission; if I&#39;m reading this right and her Sue powers sputter out of existence the moment anyone notices (perhaps including Sam herself?), then that would be an interesting and potentially hillarious trait to write into your missions. If not, you&#39;ll need to change it - the Flowers don&#39;t allow any of their agents to have SuperSue powers.<br><br>Also, the ability to manipulate plotholes, time travelling, and being noticed by Q-or-a-Q-like-entity are all marks of that same &#39;speshulness&#39; that tends to be the most common reason to deny Permission. You want her to be an ex-Sue, not a Sue Agent.<br><br>Sidhe, on the other hand, sounds like an excellent agent - not too crazy, not too sane, not too unusual. My only comment there would be that &quot;green w/ gold flecks&quot; is faintly Sue-ish description detail that we don&#39;t need. <br><br>That said, good luck :)</p>

            <p>Ah. The SuePer powers. Yes. That was actually spawned from a review on one of my contributions to &quot;The Mary Sue Experiments,&quot; which said that I had become the Self-Aware Mary-Sue. Yeah, when I was first thinking up my character, I wondered, &quot;How would her powers work if they dissapeared every time someone noticed them?&quot; And, that led to her noticing them and having them go poof as well. <br>On the &quot;Q-or-a-Q-like-entity&quot; angle... I was originally planning to do another MSE in the Star Trek continuum, but it never exactly took off, due to other circumstances. I&#39;ll try to fix &#39;er up when I start doing missions.<br>Oh, and thanks for that comment on Sidhe. Yeah, the eye-color was a bit unnecessary, wasn&#39;t it?

            <p>For my Permission, I linked to a short fanfic I&#39;d written for <i>Stardust</i>, but not all PPCers have written fanfic, so they use what they have - original fics, whatever. I suggest that, if you&#39;ve written a story of your own (fanfic or original), you should probably use that before writing something specifically <i>for</i> Permission-getting.<br><br>Then again, it&#39;s also a question of what you consider to be the best example of your abilities.

            <p>The Neuralysers. As I understand it, they require the character being neuralysed to actually see the little blinky-light, which is why sunglasses protect us from their effects, so how can one neuralyse a character who, in this version of canon, may or may not actually have EYES?<br>Suvian healing. Would a character who was badly wounded for purposes of hurt-comfort, then healed using completely wrong methods by a Sue, require proper treatment by Medical? Or would the Sue’s healing work? Would the wounds disappear when the canon snapped back into place? (She goes digging around in the bullet holes, arg arg arg…)<br>Severelys. In the badfic &quot;Possessed&quot; by Ascafennasiel, there is a line which goes “Pippin shrugged, staring at the severely.” If “severely” was a noun, do you agree that it would be a sort of spiky steel kitten? Wouldn’t “Shrike” be a good name for that kitten? And can I keep it? It’s cute.<br>Also, Zotz would like to know if Deadpool should be added to the list of characters who are aware of the PPC- since he’s aware he’s living in a comic, he should be able to tell if he’s in a fanfiction too, right? Not that I’ve ever seen a fic featuring him, but that might just be because I don’t read the right sort of fanfic…<br>And now the badfic. <br>The Day I Became Mew » reviews <br>Natasha makes a wish. Universe answers but in a most humorous way. Does Natasha have what it takes to be a Legendary? Who will she meet along the way? What trouble could she possibly get into? Original Character! <br><br>The author has another fic called “To Be A Ringwraith Or To Be a Queen”… that fic is mine. This one is a horrible self-insert Sue. At least she has relatively good spelling and grammar. Vaguely good spelling and grammar. And she isn’t just messing with Mew. Please, kill it, someone! Gaaaah! <br></p>

            <p>Neuralyzer - No, I don&#39;t think it would work in that instance. You&#39;d probably have to take the character to FicPsych.<br><br>Suvian healing - You could play it either way, I think. There are no hard and fast rules about what the canon fixes when the Sue is gone. In some stories it&#39;s almost everything, in others it&#39;s less. I guess it depends on how severe you think the Suefluence is.<br><br>Severely - Um... I have no idea. But if it were, it might be interested to meet Severe the mini-Aragog. Also, Severelys sounds like a Suvian name if you shift the emphasis to the third E.<br><br>Deadpool - Based on the little I know, it would make sense for him to be aware of fanfic and the PPC. And I&#39;m not sure that&#39;s a good thing for us. He&#39;s a bit scary. O.o<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Mkay, so I was recently asked to beta a story. Filled with good intentions, I sgreed, and have been reading through it. <br><br>And it&#39;s Gods-awfully bad. The writing is bad. The author seems not to have realized that you need end punctuation within quotation marks or at the end of questions or after dialogue tags. I suppose I should be grateful that she puts them at the end of her exposition. She also uses no contractions. While in exposition that&#39;s perfectly fine, it doesn&#39;t work in dialogue. They all sound stilted and flat.<br><br>Now, this I could deal with. After all, she&#39;s not a native English speaker, and this is what betas are for: to catch such things and correct them. However, the actual story itself is... well, allow me to summarize:<br><br>In chapter one, Harry spends his time moping and crying. He is then almost killed by Vernon, who talks almost exclusively IN CAPS WITH NO EXCLAMATION MARKS. He (Harry) blacks out after falling down the stairs (and wearing a bandage around a broken arm that he ties with his feet...) and Petunia sends Vernon and Dudley out of the house and sends a note to Dumbledore.<br><br>Dumbledore recieves the note, cries about it, and brings the four heads of house plus madam pomphrey to find and rescue Harry. They find that Vernon had also been hitting Petunia and Dudley, and they&#39;re taken to a safe house while Harry is sent to the Infirmary at Hogwarts.<br><br>Now, up until now, I could cope with this. It&#39;s clichй, but not Gods-awful. But when Harry wakes up in Hogwarts, he is informed that the Heads of House will be teaching him uber-advanced magic which Dumbledore expects him to master in a week. (Is it just me, or is Harry not actually all  that brilliant in the books?) He and Snape have a reconciliation which ends with SNAPE CRYING (gag) and Harry telling him that it&#39;s okay.<br><br>Then, Harry recieves a note from the ghost of Godric Gryffindor and goes to see him, finding out (big surprise) that he&#39;s the heir of Gryffindor. He spends the night with the ghost learning uber-advanced Transfigurations and DADA (as it&#39;s called throughout the entire fic). He emerges in the morning as one of the most powerful wizards alive and merges his wand with Godric&#39;s. Then, he is offered the post of DADA teacher for the next year (keep in mind: he&#39;s sixteen. It takes place right after OOTP).<br><br>If all that wasn&#39;t bad enough, the next night he finds out that he&#39;s also the Heir of Hufflepuff. I haven&#39;t gotten any farther, but I&#39;m willing to bet all the galleons I wish I owned that he is also Heir to Slytherin and Ravenclaw. And that he will become uber-powerful Harry who Defeats Evil With A Single Stroke and then angsts about it in his room. (He&#39;s barely stopped crying yet. It&#39;s getting excessive. And pathetic.)<br><br>So, basically, if any of you were asked to beta this, would you even try to save it? I feel bad telling the author to kill it dead, but that&#39;s what I want to do to the stupid thing. I want to send it the agents who have not yet been aproved (and who probably won&#39;t work in DMS anyway) and have them kill it. Multiple times. -sigh- Is it bad of me to not think this can be salvaged?<br><br>Sorry to ramble on. I just needed to complain a bit.<br>--anamia</p>

            <p>It did not go well. It seems slightly better than the first, but only by a little bit, which would probably be the fact that there&#39;s no reason for Harry to get more powerful because there seems to be no evil. As one of the reviews pointed out in the first one, the story is like a marshmallow. Or a giant bag of frosted marshmallows. When the story opened up by having Petunia and Harry have a heart-to-heart, loving conversation, I winced and stopped reading. (Just to clarify, I did not read the first one. I decided not to risk my canon-loving brain.) This person seems to me as if she wants a happy ending to the series, but is greatly misguided.</p>

            <p>It helps if they&#39;re in the context of the canon. I can actually see a reconciliation between Harry and Petunia, but it would take some doing.

            <p>Yikes is right. And it only gets worse. Harry is now in posession of 2450 million galleons.

            <p>The best way to rescue that story would be to shred it, pulp it, and recycle it into scrap paper on which to write notes for the new version.

            <p>It&#39;s a cliche to end all cliches, that story, but look at the best parodies - they take the cliches, run with them, and turn them into something funny. It <i>could</i> still work. Or the author and the beta could sit with it, hour by hour, for weeks, tackling every problem, and by the end there&#39;d be a story, without the cliches.

            <p>In the process of composing a tactful but firm note to the author telling her what I think of her masterpiece. It has to be tactful, since she seems to be highly sensitive. (She pulled the whole story down when someone criticized her dialogue. This to me seems irrational, since she clearly didn&#39;t edit much else, and if this is better dialogue, I&#39;d hate to see the old version.)<br><br>Anyway, thanks for the advice.

            <p>No, she didn&#39;t throw a fit. She thanked me for my positive advice and said that no one had done it constructively before. That actually makes me wonder if she really understood what I was saying. Because nothing I said about her story was positive. At all. Tactful, yes. Polite, of course. But positive? No. What I said, and I quote, is: &quot;Concerning Guardian: I&#39;ve started reading it. I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re looking for in terms of comments from me, but I&#39;ll tell you right away that it&#39;s not looking likely that I&#39;ll finish. No offense meant, but it&#39;s not the kind of story I like. You&#39;ve written Harry into a fairly catastrophic Mary Sue, and I can&#39;t see a good way to fix that without drastically and completely changing the entire story around. It could be done, but I&#39;m not sure either of us have the time it would take to give it such a complete makeover. I know that I, unfortunately, don&#39;t.&quot;<br><br>This to me does not sound especially positive. It&#39;s a rejection letter, or so I thought...<br><br>Of course, I did go on to give her tips as to how to improve her writing, so maybe that&#39;s what she meant. But teaching someone about the uses of punctuation within quotation marks is hardly positive. (Apparently no one else has mentioned the lack. That makes me wince. Something like, &quot;Where in the name of all that&#39;s holy are we&quot; Harry asked, should not be ignored. -sigh-) And then I taught her my slash writing techniques, since she&#39;d asked for them. <br><br>Oh well. I&#39;ll probably keep corresponding with her since it&#39;s the polite thing to do, but I&#39;m not going to bother reading any of her stuff anymore. Though, I suppose I should be grateful, since her fic has been very entertaining. It gave my WriYe friends and I endless entertainment as we ripped it to shreds yesterday. -grins-<br><br>--anamia</p>

            <p>My main question, after having poked around a bit, is where I might find a fairly complete history of PPC. I&#39;ve found the Reorganization, and the Crashing Down, mostly by accident, and read those. (Well, all of Reorganization and I&#39;m working on Crashing Down. I got distracted by the snowball fight. But I will finish.) These, however, seem to be a very small part of the entire history. Is there a PPC history archive where a newbie might find it from the beginning and read until now? Like, the story of the MS&#39; coming, or the Mary Sue invasion, or anything else I haven&#39;t yet found. If it&#39;s not all in the same place, then a Wiki history article with links in chronological order would be wonderous. <br><br>thanks!<br>--anamia</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve just been working on categorizing events on the Wiki. You can find most of the major events by looking up Events, PPC History, and PPC Emergencies.<br><br>However, there isn&#39;t really any such thing as a complete history of the PPC. Huinesoron&#39;s PPC Histories were larks that got accepted into the main continuity because everybody likes the stories so much. Aside from that, PPC History is made up of things that happen in missions and sometimes on the Board, and as such it&#39;s a pretty nebulous thing. Not to mention the fact that continuity in HQ is notoriously wonky, meaning that all events don&#39;t necessarily apply for all people at all times.<br><br>So... yeah.

            <p>Hi. I have no idea if this is the right place for this, and if it&#39;s not, I shall simply put on my best Sue eyes (they&#39;re not very good at all, unfortunately) and say that it&#39;s not my fault because I&#39;m new. And then you shall smite me and I shall go away to lick my wounds in shame.&#39;<br><br>So I hope I&#39;m doing this correctly.<br><br>Anywho, as you may have noticed I&#39;m new around here. I was pointed to PPC by a friend of mine after reading and then sending her an epic badfic out of morbid curiosity. So I wandered about a bit, read the original series, poked at the wiki, read some of the other bits of history, and decided that I wanted to do this too. <br><br>So here I am.<br><br>Delighted to meet you all, excited to be here, and pleased to have found a place where I seem to belong.<br><br>--anamia</p>

I&#39;m glad she&#39;s gone. It is unfortunate that your agents deemed the daughter unsalvageable, though.<br><br>One point: the expression is <i>seeing</i> as/that/how, not seen. People slur it to sound like &quot;seen&quot; a lot, but it isn&#39;t. I think you used it about three times in the mission, so you might want to go back and fix it.<br><br>So... is Tasmin from an NCIS fic, or is she just a student in the L.

            <p>So if the sue is suddenly mentioned being... *Ahem* up the stick in one chapter and yet by the end of it the kids dead and she&#39;s finished mourning for it, do I have to save the kid? Apparently she miscarried  before she started to show, and yet she mourns for all of two maybe threeish paragraphs by going to a &#39;Garden of Remembrance&#39; and making a memorial. And logically she then starts to freak about people and getting her wheelchair up the stairs, completely forgetting the kid and never mentioning it again (so far.)<br><br>Considering she actually went into the garden (which is supposedly right next to the hospital wing) do I have to burn it or will it switch back once she is dead? <br><br>~Bronwyn</p>

            <p>I&#39;m thinking of starting on a second mission.  I need to know a couple of things:<br><br>1) It says on the wiki:  &quot;Beds, chairs, cushions, and other items used for reclining are often never used in Response Centers, as it is common knowledge that as soon as one get comfortable in one, the console will beep.&quot;  Does this mean that no one keeps such items, or just that they don&#39;t generally see much use?<br><br>2) How soundproof is a Response Center?  As in, if Claypool were to shriek like a riled cat, would people hear it?  And would she, in turn, hear any yells of &quot;keep it down!&quot; that might come in response to it?</p>

            <p>1) I agree that it&#39;s completely up to the Agents, and you, of course.<br>2) Well, since we do operate by the Laws of Narrative Comedy, so in all likelihood yes, they will hear it.

            <p>1) If I may draw your attention to a previous line in the article in question: &quot;Any other contents are up to the Agents that inhabit [the RC].&quot; So, the agents can have whatever they want; it&#39;s just that Murphy&#39;s Law tends to prevent them from relaxing for long.

            <p>Not in every case, of course, but I can well imagine that some agents with over-sensitive hearing (or just really bad tempers) would take active steps to soundproof their RCs, either by snitching some useful canonical substance or bullying Maintainence into doing it. Though of course, that would force the default to be not-soundproof.</p>

            <p>Well, it could be that the walls absorb the BEEPing because for HQ BEEPing is a generic sound and the walls are made of generic substance, and someone &#39;shrieking like a riled cat&#39; isn&#39;t generic.<br><br>...Alternately, people just get used to a background noise of constant BEEPing.</p>

            <p>she&#39;s had nothing to do with minis or OFUs for a long time now. Over two years, if I recall correctly. What did you want to ask her?<br><br>OFUs are generally run and administrated independently now, but those who write them are generally connected to the PPC anyway, and it&#39;s really just a good idea to make sure no OFU exists for that particular fandom. A specific anime series is perfectly entitled to its own OFU - I was the co-writer of the Tsubasa Reservoir Chronicles OFU before my partner gave up on it.<br><br>On the same note, each anime is permitted to have its own minis, too. You can&#39;t just lump the entire diverse field of animes into one category. A mini has to be specific to the fandom. A mini for, say, <i>Bleach</i> would not be the same as one from <i>Fullmetal Alchemist</i> or something.<br><br>Please don&#39;t take me as an expert on anime - I just happen to know a few of the Boarders who are. I&#39;m speaking more in general fandom terms; you wouldn&#39;t lump all vampire stories in as one overarching fandom - there&#39;s Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Dracula, and Twilight, just as examples, and they&#39;re all utterly different.<br><br>Hoping this helps.</p>

            <p>Too small. I mean, Arthur&#39;s a cat. Not-so-mini-Arthurs, perhaps? <s>Yes, I have thought of this before, and dismissed Arthur because of his size.</s> Or maybe mini-Lancelots or mini-Gurens. Still Knightmares, but not as common as regular grunt models, and pretty damned scary to see if you&#39;re on the opposite side of a fight and just a grunt.</p>

            <p>Well, the Guren&#39;s always popping up. There are many versions of it, the latest being the Guren S.E.I.T.E.N. (eight elements). Plus, the Lancelot has versions too, like the Lancelot Albion (and C.C.&#39;s Lancelot Frontier).<br><br>Maybe mini-Shinkiros. There&#39;s only one (Lelouch&#39;s), so it&#39;s not as common as even the Guren, and it&#39;s harder to control.<br><br>My bigger question is: how do I get permission to write an OFU?<br><br>Thanks,<br>~Xanthia B.</p>

            <p>Mini-Shinkirous would work, yeah. And they&#39;d be so cute as well.<br><br>I think you just need to have the ideas for it and have good writing skills and a high level of canon knowledge. Someone else might know more though. I&#39;ve never considered writing an OFU.</p>

            <p>I mean, with a canon like Code Geass that has so many Japan-only supplementary materials (such as the sound dramas that Bandai (?) (no access to Wikipedia right now, stupid internet) apparently included in the first season special edition sets but isn&#39;t including in the R2 DVDs) you either have to hope that a translation group will get round to them, or just go off main canon (i.e. the anime) and use Wikipedia/fandom Wikia (yes, Code Geass has a Wikia) to check any other information.</p>

Cooper out.”<br>Slowly Agent Cooper reattached his radio to his belt and took a deep breath, preparing his mind for the mission ahead. Giving himself a quick shake, he peered out from the shrubbery he’d taken cover under. Before him he saw the long trek he had until his destination, and a series of dangerous obstacles between him and his prize.<br>Just as he made to crawl out from under cover one of Boss’ guards walked out of hiding not far in front of him. The shadowy character was tall and thin with a large gun held ready in gloved hands. Quickly and silently Cooper slid back out of sight, fearing he had been spotted. The guard glanced shortly at the stand of trees next to him with suspicious eyebrows cocked, then continued patrolling the area’s perimeter. As soon as the guard was out of sight, Cooper darted out from his hiding space, keeping low to the ground.<br>He journeyed more than half the distance without any further occurrence, but as he made to crawl around the trees that would direct him toward his goal a guard dog prowled in his direction. Holding his breath, the special agent pressed himself down into the mud, hiding any exposed skin and trying desperately to hold completely still. The dog approached him, sniffing the air eagerly as it searched for the intruder. Moving slowly and deliberately so as not to attract attention, Cooper lifted a small stone and tossed it toward the hedge where he’d just been. The guard animal immediately turned and raced after the rock, no longer interested in the direction in which the agent lay.<br>Breathing a sigh of relief, Agent Cooper began creeping forward again. He crawled past a position where a large bald guard stood in his outpost, transmitting a report over his radio in a strange language. His heart beat rose as he realized how close he was to succeeding in his mission. Tango Kilo, was directly ahead and Riley could see his target sitting on the windowsill of the hut. He took several deep breaths as he crept towards the open window, steadying his nerves. If he got too anxious he would never make it away with his life.<br>The agent crouched beneath the window, waiting and watching for a moment when Boss  Mama would be looking in the opposite direction. There she went - something caught her attention on the table in the next room to her. Cooper leapt to his feet, and made a dive towards the target.<br>“Riley, get your hand out of that cookie jar,” Mrs. Cooper said without even turning to look at him. Riley’s hand retreated hastily. “How many times do I have to tell you? No cookies before dinner. Now go and wash up. Dinner will be ready in just a few minutes.”<br>Cooper grumbled and turned away, retracing the way he had come. The frustration of defeat hung heavily over him as he passed his father chatting away on his cell phone. His father glanced up long enough to grin and roll his eyes before going back to his conversation again. <br>“Got busted again, special agent?” his older sister jibbed with a snide grin. He shot a short glance at her as she carried the hairdryer past him towards her bedroom “You’re never going to get away with that trick, runt.  Mom sees all.”<br>Riley continued past her and to the bathroom sink. As he washed his hands beneath the rushing water a slow smile spread over his face. He hurried into his room and drew the small tape recorder from his belt.<br>“1800 hours. Special Agent Riley Cooper reporting in. Operation was a failure. Position was compromised. Will attempt the mission again tomorrow.   Cooper out.”&#39;<br><br>I hope you will take look over my application and deem it worthy of the PPC, if you should not I will do my best to improve and apply again at a later date.<br><br>Sincerely,<br><br>Bronwyn.</p>

            <p>I agree with Indemaat that you have been on the Board for a small amount of time; however, if you send me your first mission at the e-mail address above, I will look it over. You seem to have a good grasp of the basic spirit of the PPC; I recommend browsing the wiki a little more, but you have the essentials down. <br><br>In addition to the Torchwood minis, PotC minis are not mini-Krakens. Norflington is a Misspelled Monkey. You can find a (mostly) complete index of minis <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Mini">here</a>.

Good thing I haven&#39;t sent anything yet or I&#39;d look like a compete dork. I&#39;ll fix this and finish the mission before reposting. Oy vay.<br><br>Oh and before I forget, when should I kill the sue? I&#39;m only on the fourth chapter and I&#39;ve racked up 103 separate charges, And Eight (count them) Geographical aberrations, of which there are 2 banks (U.S., France), 6 freaking mansions (U.S., U.K., France) and a loft (U.K.) to burn down, 6 mini-Aragogs, and 3 Mini-balrogs. And I&#39;ve still got eight chapters left. I don&#39;t know how much more I can take. Can I PLEASE kill her yet? Oh and she was disabled because of Mr. Dursley beating her, but her wand is made of &#39;Galadriel&#39;s hair, the &#39;heart tree&#39; of rivendel, a bone from the Balrog Gandalf slew, And hair from Lord Elronds head&#39;. WHISKEY TANGLE FOXTROT! And I&#39;ve still got eight freaking chapters, and the thing isn&#39;t even finished. <br><br>PLEASE, for the love of The Flying Spaghetti Monster let me kill her now before I lose my nerve and never become an Agent because I&#39;m drooling in the Psych Ward due to Brain trama because I stabbed myself in the eye with a dull spoon.<br><br>Many Thanks,<br><br>~Bronwyn</p>

            <p>It&#39;s called <i>Pain</i>. The title is listed on our agent pages. It&#39;s apt. It&#39;s been there for almost a year now. It just... sits there. Occasionally, when Trojie&#39;s feeling very brave, she opens the doc, stares in blank horror for a while, writes a line, and then goes to gibber in a corner.<br><br>It does, however, contain bits of our personal canon that have been referenced later. We sort of view it as, well, there must be a lot more missions take place than just the ones that are recorded (otherwise some agents are slacking big time). So, for now, <i>Pain</i> is an unrecorded mission, and one day it&#39;ll be recorded. In the meantime, we sit and weep.<br><br>Other than that? We get ideas while talking over gchat while writing in gdocs, but not all the ideas we come up with end up getting worked in. No full scenes that were deleted though.</p>
