            <p>More charges: Bending Fiona so out of character that she actually is willing to warn tails of whatever sally is up to, giving amy some kind of telepathy (unless that&#39;s actually canon somewhere, I know bioware brought back her tarot cards) and fangirl Japanese even though Sonic is inspired by western culture.<br><br>Also, the author seems to think sonic lives on another planet.  In the sonic X canon he lives in an entirely different dimension and can&#39;t travel to earth without endangering that dimension.  In the games they just live on earth.  In the Archie continuity they live on a planet that turns out to be earth in the far future.  My guess is that the author only saw the 4kids dub of sonic X, where according to the dialogue they did come from another planet.</p>

            <p>You know how it&#39;s possible for a written work to hit where it really hurts? To constrict the throat and pierce the heart? It&#39;s a subjective thing, I know. What can bring one person to tears may not have the slightest effect on another. However, this did it for me.<br><br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2012082/1/">Love is a hole in the heart</a>, by Ringil (Good Omens)<br><br>I couldn&#39;t bear it. I really couldn&#39;t. So, I left a review for the story, and in that review, I asked for permission to write a sequel. That permission was granted, and this is the result.<br><br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6569756/1/Love_fills_a_hole_in_the_heart">Love fills a hole in the heart</a>.<br><br>Please, do not think me weak for this. Like I said, I just had to do it.<br><br>Consider this my heart laid bare. And I do not feel ashamed.<br><br>(The above should not be taken to mean that I&#39;m afraid of honest opinions.

            <p>...and the like. I&#39;m rushed and headachey and not entirely up for comment at the moment, but a few days ago someone linked to <a href="http://kitwhitfield.blogspot.com/2010/07/next-person-who-says-hur-hur-they-must.html">this post</a>, titled &quot;The next person who says &#39;Hur hur they must have been on drugs when they did that&#39; gets punched&quot;. It&#39;s an excellent post, and I&#39;m wondering-- what do you guys think? We&#39;ve done the &quot;What are they <i>on</i> <s>and where can I get some?</s>&quot; conversations here, and I&#39;m not going to pretend they don&#39;t make me a little twitchy. Given, in those cases we&#39;re usually boggling at the stupid, so it&#39;s a little less irritating. But this is something I&#39;ve noticed (more in the IRC): someone will link to a surreal, strange sort of thing, and go &quot;Man, what drugs were they on?&quot; or similar-- and it always seems to be treated like a bad thing. Which is rather frustrating for those of us who rather value creativity.<br><br>What do y&#39;all think?</p>

            <p>I don&#39;t recall having seen this used as a comment on particularly creative things. The only times I have heard it used both in Real Life and online is in reference to acts of extreme stupidity.  <br><br>Such as &quot;What was he smoking to think that pouring all the powder from an entire case of bullets into the barrel of a gun and then pulling the trigger repeatedly was a good idea?&quot; (Real life incident by the way, I think he kept all his fingers and the fire was contained to the kitchen--I&#39;ll have to ask my sister for an update). <br><br>Or &quot;What drugs was that author on when they decided t at one in the morning to write the untold <s>porn</s>love story of Frodo and Aragorn and post it before they went to bed at four that same morning.&quot;<br><br>Using it toward any act of creativity would be annoying, and there are much more creative insults that could be hurled in the general direction of the people creating either of the above situations, so I agree that it could be retired.</p>

            <p>There&#39;s an excellent TV Tropes page to the effect that actually making certain creative things while on drugs is difficult. And then we have that one poem about Kublai Khan in Xanadu that the author claims to have made on drugs. So... yeah. I guess dismissing anything odd as having been made on drugs is stupid. After all, something Axe Cop is excessively weird not because it was made on drugs, but because it was written by a creative seven year old.<br><br>I would provide linkses but I have no experience with this type of board and don&#39;t know how.

Both mean nothing, and both were invented in the wee hours of the morning.

I also like Lord of the Rings. <br><br>Notable opinions on fandoms:<br><br>Lord of the Rings: Yes, I have read the books. No, I was unable to make it more than fifty pages into the Simeralion. Sorry, I&#39;m not that dedicated.<br><br>Animorphs: Seriously? That&#39;s how you end your series?<br><br>Star Wars: Han shot first. Anything after the Hand of Thrawn books has not been read by the Guvnor. <br><br>Stargate: Yes, Universe sucks. No, it is not worth boycotting, and is still better than most anything else on TV. Hell, it&#39;s better than the last season of Atlantis. <br><br><br><br>So, until next time... <br><br>Guvnor of Space signing off! *trumpet fanfare*</p>

            <p>That was a bit terrifying. The &#39;fic, that is; the mission was thoroughly enjoyable and elicited giggles.

            <p>I&#39;m still nailing down the style and tone I use in these missions, and what name I refer to the characters influences that. Using a different name sometimes changes the feel of a paragraph. COMMENCE EXTREMELY NIT PICKY PRETENTIOUS EXPLANATION.<br><br>&quot;Aster Corbett, in all of her dignity, tripped over a misplaced comma and was sent rocketing out a second story window.&quot;<br><br>(This feels more full-bodied and &#39;round&#39; to me. Aster Corbett, with all of her being, trips over something.)<br><br>&quot;Agent Corbett, in all of her dignity, tripped over a misplaced comma and was sent rocketing out a second story window.&quot;<br><br>(This feels more &#39;professional&#39; on Aster&#39;s part, and the blunder is very un-professional, changing the tone of the feel of the statement slightly.)<br><br>&quot;Aster, in all of her dignity, tripped over a misplaced comma and was sent rocketing out a second story window.&quot;<br><br>(This is more colloquial, more like the antics of a klutzy kid rather than a professional or grown-up&#39;s screw-up.)<br><br>&quot;Corbett, in all of her dignity, tripped over a misplaced comma and was sent rocketing out a second story window.&quot;<br><br>(This is more distant and impersonal than any of them. Using a surname only creates a distance and a coldness between the character and the reader. This doesn&#39;t fit the feel of Aster&#39;s character, so I don&#39;t use it. Usually this is only appropriate to use if the character&#39;s personal name has never been mentioned, which makes them only an acquaintance anyway, not a friend.)<br><br>In this mission, Aster Corbett herself is just being introduced, so I use her full name a lot to kind of present her. Also, it is her first PPC mission, so I refer to her a lot as a more &#39;professional&#39; figure... though just to point out with her actions she&#39;s anything but professional and is still quite noobish.<br><br>Later missions, when she&#39;s more comfortable, I probably will just use her first name more. Lore is immune to this. Lore is Lore. Sometimes he is Agent Lore, at which point he is all business, but otherwise... Lore is mysterious, but very plain and doesn&#39;t need any modifier.<br><br>Also, I don&#39;t like using &#39;the girl&#39; or &#39;the woman&#39; to refer to Aster, because there&#39;s often more than one girl or woman around if we&#39;re chasing a Mary Sue-- and also it makes Aster feel younger, or older, when she&#39;s really age-neutral at 20 years old and doesn&#39;t act quite like a child or quite like an adult. Also , &#39;the agent&#39; is right out most of the time, too-- both Aster and Lore are PPC agents and using this could mean either of them if they&#39;re in the same scene together. Word Worlds face enough pronoun and character identification errors without me helping! <br><br>I think about this stuff all the time. There&#39;s a mouth-feel to writing, I think... which is why terrible writing sometimes tastes so bad. It has an unpleasant tone and texture that doesn&#39;t go down the gullet very well, or use diction to portray any kind of attitude towards the characters or setting.</p>

            <p>Sorry about that. I didn&#39;t notice my post got sliced. <br><br>Agent concepts:<br><br>Aster Corbett: Human female, approximately 18-20 years old. Rescued from self-insert fic that was never finished beyond the first page.<br><br>Lore: Resembles a large canid beast, possesses reptilian/saurian feet, and horns. Black, eyes glow. A demigod in original fiction, but if he has powers they&#39;re unknown: He refuses to use them save for limited shapeshifting as disguise-- not even in emergency situations. Generally behaves like a (smug but ordinary) 30 year old human male, with no &#39;special&#39; knowledge beyond what would be expected of a PPC agent: pretty much treat as an alien species.<br><br>Story for Mission: <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6225510/1/Ganondorf_In_My_Crawlspace"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6225510/1/Ganondorf_In_My_Crawlspace">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6225510/1/Ganondorf_In_My_Crawlspace</a></a><br><br>Hormonal young woman with no idea of romance beyond kissing bends The Legend of Zelda Canon to force Link to immediately love her. This is hypocritical because she over and over again berates people who hit on her as &#39;pervs&#39; while she flirts mercilessly with Link. Defeats Ganondorf with pig latin and Christianity, and receives the Triforce of Power and then it is never mentioned again. Later chapters have no plot beyond &#39;I wub Link it is twoo wub.&#39;</p>

            <p>Also, I&#39;m watching you on dA now. {= )<br><br>I really enjoyed the zombie story. It&#39;s very touching, even if it is about the rotting undead. I could really see the scenes in my mind&#39;s eye, but not enough of the characters to be grossed out at all. It&#39;s really well done.<br><br>So, go forth and PPC! That Zelda fic sounds awful.

            <p>Not the one to come to for official rulings, but I&#39;m pretty sure this isn&#39;t the place for a full post like this. Far as I can tell, it&#39;s better suited for another site like LiveJournal, with maybe a link here to there. Don&#39;t quote me, but I think this wasn&#39;t the best place to host the piece. I&#39;ll just hide now.</p>

            <p>But it&#39;s probably not the best idea to actually put the entire MST here, no. For one thing, as said, while this community certainly has a lot of MST fans, that&#39;s not exactly what the Board is for, and links are different to posts. More pragmatically, threads on this board fall off after a while and no one will see them again, so indeed, LJ or a similar site are better places for long-term publication.</p>

Screw this, I’m going to go play Left 4 Dead 2… [Stands as if to leave and then sits down at BRIAN’s gesturing]<br>&gt; It was the middle of the school year and I had been a<br>&gt;transfer student.<br>MICAH: Where I was transferred to was worse than anyone else’s guess.<br>&gt; I walked through the halls<br>BRIAN: And soon realized she was lost when she found herself walking on the ceiling.<br>&gt; and made my way to the office. &quot;Hello how may I help you?&quot;<br>JACKSON: Yeah, I’ll have a large three-quarter pounder with cheese—<br>BRIAN: Jax, we already did a drive-thru joke. That’s on cool down for another week.<br>JACKSON: Shit, still? I thought that was reduced to two weeks in the last patch!<br>MICAH: Next patch. I’m still pissed at the Death Knight nerfing they’re doing…<br>&gt; said the woman at the desk. &quot;Yeah I&#39;m new and I&#39;m not <br>&gt;shore<br>KIRA: [Secretary] Really? You look more like a beach to me.<br>OTHERS: …<br>MICAH: Lame.<br>KIRA: Shut up.<br>&gt; where I&#39;m supposed to be.&quot; I said shyly.<br>&gt;&quot;What&#39;s your name?&quot; said the woman<br>&gt;&quot;Yami Hakumei&quot; I answered<br>MICAH: Oh great. We’re stuck in the head of a Sue.<br>&gt;The woman looked through some papers and pulled one out. &gt;&quot;Ah yes. You&#39;re our new transfer student.&quot;<br>BRIAN: [Yami] Did I mention I was the transfer student?<br>&gt;I nodded. &quot;Here&#39;s your schedule and the list of books you<br>&gt; will need to get.&quot; she handed me some papers<br>KIRA: [Yami, reading the papers] “Don’t forget… milk, whipped cream, cherries, chocolate sauce…”<br>KAT: [Secretary] Oh, wrong paper! [Pantomimes taking the paper from KIRA and hands her another.]<br>KIRA: [Yami reading] “Meet me behind the gymnasium after I get out of school today, I have been thinking about you…”<br>KAT: [Secretary] That’s wrong too! [Replaces papers]<br>KIRA: [Yami reading] …Oh, OK. …”Human-dissection…?”<br>KAT: [Secretary] It’s a new class.<br>&gt; and sent me off to my first class.<br>MICAH: After the hall monitor spotted me and set loose three large guard dogs.<br>&gt;My first class was study.<br>BRIAN: I get a feeling the author didn’t do enough of that for this.<br>&gt; I walked in quietly and sat down in the very back seat<br>&gt; nearest the window.<br>JACKSON: Obviously the perfect spot for the emo Sue.<br>&gt; A couple of girls walked over to me an asked me my name. &gt;&quot;Yami Hakumei&quot; I said nervously. &quot;That&#39;s quite a name&quot;<br>KIRA: For a Mary Sue.<br>&gt; said one of the girls trying to hold back laughter.<br>KIRA: She remembered this funny joke about Superman, Wonder Woman and the Invisible Man…<br>BRIAN: Kira, I thought you had taste.<br>KIRA: I’m going out with you, Brian, what taste?<br>BRIAN: Ah, touchй.<br>&gt; They walked away and started laughing and making fun of<br>&gt; my name.<br>MICAH: I Mind Crushed them later that day during lunch.<br>&gt; I folded my arms on the desk and put my head down.<br>MICAH: Assume the Crying Emo position.<br>&gt; I had nothing to do,<br>KIRA: All my mindless wandering through the school helped me find the exits to block when I decided to shoot this place up…<br>&gt; so I just stared out the window.<br>MICAH: First class and the Sue does nothing but mope because someone’s making fun of her name… What has this to do with KareKano again?<br>&gt;Suddenly I felt a tap on my shoulder.<br>JACKSON: [Student] Can I have my seat back, please?<br>&gt; &quot;Hi&quot; I said shyly.<br>&gt;&quot;Hey, your new right?&quot; said the boy.<br>BRIAN: [Yami] Yeah. I’m going to get my left replaced tomorrow at the shop.<br>&gt;&quot;Yeah&quot; I answered.<br>&gt;&quot;I see you met Karei and her posy&quot;<br>JACKSON: She goes everywhere with that damn flower of hers.<br>&gt;I nodded<br>&gt;&quot;I&#39;m Koyuki Kanashimi.&quot;<br>KEIKO: Meaning “Silly windows going justly about apples”.<br>&gt;&quot;I&#39;m Yami Hakumei.&quot;<br>MICAH: The definition you gave, Keiko, is a little disturbing…<br>&gt;&quot;Nice to meat you Yami.&quot;<br>JACKSON: You think he was checking out her melons?<br>BRIAN: With a slip up like that how more obvious can he get?<br>&gt; he said. Then I heard a yell come from Karei. &quot;Koyuki<br>&gt; don&#39;t talk to her.&quot;<br>&gt;&quot;Why not?&quot; Koyuki yelled back<br>MICAH: [Karei] She’ll give you cooties!<br>JACKSON: Aren’t you a little old for that thinking, Mic?<br>MICAH: …And?<br>&gt;&quot;She&#39;s a loner.<br>JACKSON: Ew, does that mean she’s a tran—<br>BRIAN: Loner, Jackson. Not boner.<br>&gt; And I heard her parents are both dead.<br>KEIKO: And she smells funny. And she totally eats guys on her date. Cannibalism is nasty!<br>&gt; Her dad killed her mom and then killed him self. And just<br>&gt; listen to her name Yami,<br>BRIAN: [Karei] It’s like calling her Puke or Barf, that’s nasty.<br>&gt; who wants a name that means darkness. So how many suicide<br>&gt; pills are you on Yami?&quot;<br>MICAH: This chick is getting an award for worst antagonist.<br>&gt;I looked at her about to cry and put my head back own on<br>&gt; my desk.<br>BRIAN: This is out protagonist, everyone.<br>&gt; &quot;Oh she&#39;s crying&quot; said Karei sarcastically.<br>JACKSON: [Heavy Weapons Guy] Go cry, little baby! Cry some more!<br>&gt;Koyuki walked back over to me<br>JACKSON: Where the hell did he go?<br>BRIAN: Probably to get coffee. He was needed out of the shot.<br>&gt; and said &quot;Hey just ignore them.<br>BRIAN: Say that when they follow you everywhere you go.<br>&gt; Your name is beautiful.<br>KIRA: I thought her name was Yami…?<br>KAT: Nope.

Forget about her.<br>&gt; She&#39;s not worth it.&quot;<br>BRIAN: For $229.28 she sure as hell ain’t!<br>&gt;The bell rang and I was the last on<br>MICAH: Even after everyone else got off the bus, I rode it to the end of the line.

She’s as much of a shut-in as Shinji Ikari!<br>&gt; With in the time I got there to the time lunch started,<br>&gt; many stories about me had erupted.<br>BRIAN: Optimus Christ almighty, four hours in school and already everyone’s writing fan fiction about her!<br>JACKSON: It’s like Harry Potter all over again! We’re not safe!<br>&gt; The only one I heard was that I killed both my parents<br>&gt; and made it look like my dad did it.<br>KIRA: [Yami] I quickly decided none of these people were going to write a biography about me.<br>&gt; With that being spread around at lunch I sat alone.<br>KAT: The moment she comes unhinged and tosses someone out a window I will laugh my ass off.<br>KIRA: You’re… you’re kinda scary sometimes, Kat.<br>&gt; I went to the last of my classes and went home, well as<br>&gt; close to home as I could get. It was more are less a tent<br>&gt; in the woods. I had no more family to go to so I lived in<br>&gt; the forest.<br>MICAH: Wait; where the hell is Child Services? Shouldn’t they have put her in an orphanage or something? Do they even exist in Japan?<br>KEIKO: Kind of. But they usually just take the orphans to train them to ride around in giant robots, wear colorful jumpsuits and fight aliens.<br>MICAH: So… The Power Rangers are a Japanese government project?<br>KEIKO: Well… not at first.<br>&gt;My whole family was dead. I only ever had a mom, dad and a<br>&gt; grandmother but they are all dead now.<br>JACKSON: Why I’m not living with my grandfather, who is hinted to be the only living relative I could have, is not relevant.<br>&gt; Both of my parents were the only children in there family<br>&gt; so I had no aunts or uncles.<br>KAT: No wonder her parents are dead. They couldn’t handle the thought of their daughter being an emo!<br>&gt;As I walked home I was feeling really sad about my parents.<br>MICAH: My god, give this girl some valium or something!<br>&gt; I never really liked or cared for either of them.<br>KAT: I may be somewhat selfish at times, but at least I remember my parent’s own goddamn birthdays!<br>&gt; But when people say things like what happened at school<br>&gt; it makes me feel like I have to have parents to be normal.<br>BRIAN: You think maybe she should see a psychiatrist about this?<br>KIRA: Brian, the only thing a shrink is going to do and make her even more of a pain in everyone’s ass.<br>&gt; Maybe that&#39;s it. Maybe I&#39;m just not normal.<br>MICAH: When you go around being a little crybaby like this, you’re enforcing everyone else’s look on you!<br>&gt; Or was I felling bad about ignoring that boy in my study.<br>JACKSON: Or indigestion. Those chicken rings didn’t seem to settle right…<br>&gt; I don&#39;t know.<br>MICAH: That’s the author’s response when asked where she as going to take this story.<br>&gt;I arrived at the entrance to the forest path.<br>BRIAN: I wish she was at Aokigahara forest.<br>KEIKO: Don’t say that! I lost a cousin there, you bastard!<br>&gt; I walked in.<br>KAT: And was quickly mauled by a bear and put out of my misery.<br>&gt; I walked about 30 yards and looked for the heart tree.<br>&gt; Its tree that&#39;s trunk was split in 2 and the 2 sides meet<br>&gt; and form a heart shape.<br>KIRA: How it’s possible the tree was made is anyone’s guess.<br>&gt; That&#39;s the marker I use <br>KIRA: To draw on people’s faces when they pass out stoned or drunk.<br>&gt;to fined the right place to turn. I turned into the dark<br>&gt; forest<br>KAT: Oh god it’s the ending of David the Gnome all over again!<br>JACKSON: NOOOOOO! DAAVIIIID! WHYYY???! [Begins crying]<br>KAT: [In disbelief] Holy crap someone else remembers that show!<br>&gt; and walked.

Better yet, she *reviews* them!

            <p>Actually, communities like pottersues were once fairly common on livejournal. Most of them are dead now--more&#39;s the pity--but they&#39;re still useful as archives of older badfics. You&#39;re more likely to find them for big fandoms like HP, but some small fandoms have them as well.</p>

            <p>Thought I should share this: <a href="http://www.cakewrecks.blogspot.com/"><a href="http://www.cakewrecks.blogspot.com/">http://www.cakewrecks.blogspot.com/</a></a><br>For each of the twelve days leading up to Christmas (so it&#39;s already started, but the pages are still up) Cake Wrecks posts the name of a different charity and a link to a page where money can be given. The blog&#39;s owners are asking everyone who reads to contribute just one dollar each day. Thousands of people read the blog, and twelve dollars from each of them adds up to quite a lot.<br><br>Even if you can&#39;t contribute for whatever reason, I hope the knowledge this is being done brings a little cheer to your day. Happy holidays, everyone :)</p>

            <p>It&#39;s called <em>The Storm Dragons.</em> It utterly deconstructs the original. Galbatorix is the main character, Eragon and Vrael are the main villains; it sticks to what happened in Canon until the end of <em>Eldest,</em> and then goes off on its own.<br>It&#39;s really, really long, longer than the books, and certainly a lot more detailed and better-written. It gets a teeny bit violent or squicky at times, but in general it&#39;s just awesome. I&#39;ve started to think of this story as the canon and <em>Eragon</em> as a pathetic Draco-In-Leather-Pants fanfic. <br>If you want to read it, it&#39;s here: <br><br><a href="http://www.shurtugal.com/fanfiction/viewseries.php?seriesid=120"><a href="http://www.shurtugal.com/fanfiction/viewseries.php?seriesid=120">http://www.shurtugal.com/fanfiction/viewseries.php?seriesid=120</a></a><br></p>

            <p>They make up the entire category of &quot;better than the original&quot;. At least in my opinion. I&#39;ve never read <i>Eragon</i>, though, so I can&#39;t judge this. Glad to hear it exists, though :)</p>

            <p>Yeah, <em>Eragon</em> is pretty terrible and I think it kind of inspires &#39;Sues; there&#39;s some pretty bad stuff on that site as well. I&#39;m kinda surprised to hear that there is good Twilight fanfiction, though; do you have a link to some? Because I want to read it. </p>

            <p>I don&#39;t know the full context, but I expect it means that Artemis is angry and/or pouting, and sits down forcefully with his arms crossed to show as much. &quot;Go to the naughty step&quot; is a version of &quot;you&#39;re in time out&quot; or &quot;go to your room&quot;--the child has misbehaved, so their punishment is to be temporarily removed from the group. It&#39;s very effective when done properly. However, assuming Artemis is a good bit older than a young child, it&#39;s a bit demeaning to suggest that he would behave that way. (I&#39;ve never read <i>Artemis Fowl</i>, so I have no idea; just supposing.)<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>A lot of people like <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/">LiveJournal</a> or <a href="http://www.dreamwidth.org/">Dreamwidth</a> or something similar--the benefits include not having to know HTML or having to worry about being deleted, but navigation can be an issue. Some folks do use Fanfiction.net, but there is a risk of being reported and taken off.<br><br>Other people use a free web host, like <a href="http://www.webs.com/">Webs</a> (formerly Freewebs) or <a href="http://www.tripod.lycos.com">Tripod</a>. I&#39;ve been using Tripod for years with no complaints; others really like Webs. Both have options for either using your own HTML (I taught myself how to do this; it&#39;s possible to learn if you want complete control over your site) or a site builder that lets you customize a pre-made theme without knowing any code.<br><br>I suppose it would work to use <a href="http://www.deviantart.com">deviantART</a>, too, especially if you&#39;re an artist as well as a writer. There are lots of PPCers with accounts there, though I don&#39;t think anyone currently uses it to host missions.<br><br>So, like I said, it&#39;s really up to you. All the above have their pros and cons. You just have to decide what most appeals to you.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

If you don&#39;t want or need it, sorry to clutter.<br><br>-San is essentially Ms or Mr. Formal and polite in company you don&#39;t know.<br><br>-Sama is much closer, showing a deep respect for the person you&#39;re giving the honorific to.<br><br>-Kun is a male denotation, commonly among friends. Typically used by guys, for guys.<br><br>-Chan is associated with females, again commonly used between friends or by guys interested in the female in question. Shows cuteness.<br><br>Lastly, no honorific from someone who uses honorifics can be the most important. It is a very intimate thing, meant only to be used between people who have truly earned trust. It can be very rewarding to hear it from someone who earned this privillage, but from others it can be an insult.<br><br>And there you have it. If someone&#39;s going to use honorifics, they shouldn&#39;t have an excuse with improper usage. I do consider you far above me in status on the site, hence my usage of -Senpai with you, Aeidhryn-sempai. Still, doesn&#39;t mean I can&#39;t knock it off if it annoys you.</p>

You know? <br><br>*end rant*<br><br>I&#39;m not above you or below you. I&#39;m possibly very south north east or west... left or right.

            <p>You&#39;re welcome. Still, like many things with Japan, it&#39;s a matter of respect. Better to refer to someone with respect typically then intimacy, as far as I can tell. I know what you mean about the &quot;nice girl&quot; thing, but I&#39;d rather treat you with respect rather than possibly insult you. Far as I can tell, you deserve that at the very least.<br><br>Regardless of what position you&#39;re in compared to me.</p>

            <p>Wise. Lack of respect for others is not tolerated around here. So, yeah. I mean... don&#39;t be scared of me, anyways. I&#39;m probably more scared of you and all the others more than the others put together are of each other. Hmm... did that sentence structure make sense? Probably not.

            <p>Of course they&#39;re X-ray glasses... but just if you have X-Ray vision. I blame Laws of Narrative Comedy, but I always blame them so pay no heed when I run around screaming against them. Pay no heed to anything here in fact, except if you see someone with a flamethrower.</p>

            <p>Hello all I&#39;m Fate&#39;s End and I would like to begin by saying that I like more continua than I can count. I&#39;ve been a fan of the PPC for a while and hope to get along with you people.<br>Now for THE QUESTION! *da na na na*<br>What separates an AU from a canon? For example, is Pokegirls a canon? And if so, that raises another question: in a massively multiplayer canon like that, what is and isn&#39;t fanfiction? Does it all count as fics then? Or is everything, from the best stories to bottom of the barrel, canon? Or is it somewhere in between?<br>Now that I&#39;ve wasted your time, I&#39;d like to conclude by saying that you, from what I have seen, are all awesome. Except for some of you.</p>

            <p>Here you have a six-pack of Japanese Bilk, a beer that tastes like milk. I think the AUs thing depends if they have some kind of widely-agreed canon, for example if in some types of AUs the characters are written in a specific way, for exmple in Death Note it&#39;s believed that one of the characters has red eyes, but it is never said in the canon story, it&#39;s just a widely-agreed thing. Hope it helps a bit.</p>

            <p>Well met rookie! Please enjoy this six pack of Nuka-Cola as a welcoming gift.<br><br>I&#39;m not sure what others might think, but I personally believe that AUs are far more generalized that genuine spin-off canons. AUs can be boiled down to a few types: the High School AU, the Zombie AU, the What-If AU, and so on. <br><br>Actual spin-off continuities should be able to stand on their own in some regard and should have some measure of recognition from outsiders. They should have their own characters and own rules. They&#39;ve also usually either been running for a while or have racked up a lot of stories in a short amount of time. The machnima series Red vs Blue, for example, is set in the Halo universe but has developed enough of its own characters and plots to be considered a separate entity.<br><br>While I am not familiar with Pokegirls, a cursory read-through of the appropriate TV Tropes page makes me think that it would stand as its own canon. It has its own rules and backstory as established by the community. Fanfiction about a canon like that would probably come from outside of the community, stuff from non-approved writers. It&#39;s a bit like PPC stories in that regard, actually.<br><br>I hope this all made sense. It did in my head.</p>

A lot of the stuff there was written contemporarily with Jay and Acacia.<br><br>And, if I may plug myself, I think I might be the only person currently writing for the Department of Implausible Crossovers and Fictional Psychology, so here&#39;s <a href="http://starshadowhall.tripod.com/ppc/rc999/">Supernumerary and Ilraen&#39;s home page</a> and <a href="http://starshadowhall.tripod.com/ppc/ficpsych/">FicPsych</a>.<br><br>Since that&#39;s more than enough to be going on with, I&#39;ll again say welcome, and enjoy!<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>As you can see by the tagline, I managed to find a good fic while cruising the favorites list of a FF.net author (Fangalla Marie and Eppy the Houseelf).  Anyways, it&#39;s titled &quot;Wait, what?&quot; and is a Harry Potter story. Here&#39;s a <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6315336/1/Wait_what">link </a>. <br>You know how people are always writing &quot;Wrong BWL&quot; stories, and thus managing to destroy just about everything we hold dear and beloved about the HP canon? Well . . . This is a slightly different take on it.  It doesn&#39;t really state who the <i>real</i> Boy-Who-Lived is, but it does give an interesting insight into the author&#39;s opinion of Professor Dumbledore, and a very amusing rendition of Lily.<br>Anyways, I think it&#39;s a fairly good story, and it&#39;s only a one-shot (didn&#39;t check to see if there were any connected stories from the author, found <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/u/1137344/esama">here</a>), and it is amusing.  Had me in chuckles, throughout it. <strike>&#39;Course, I have a terrible sens of humor, so...</strike><br>-Honu_Wahine<br>(And if you thought <i>your</i> mother was an over-protective demon, you haven&#39;t seen <i>this</i> one.)</p>

            <p>Now, when I was eight I got through the first three chapters of The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe before losing interest, and I never got around to trying them again, so I can&#39;t give much of an opinion in terms of accuracy.<br><br>That said, I&#39;ve taken Honors English classes all throughout high school, so I know what a good essay is and this is not a good essay. While it&#39;s important to avoid having a wishy-washy or passive voice, this author&#39;s tone is far too forceful, almost insulting to the reader. It relies on the use of strong language to make its point, and thus it&#39;s difficult to be taken seriously.<br><br>Furthermore, in all the types of essays I&#39;ve ever written, be they persuasive or analytical or any other, my teachers have stressed the importance of evidence to back up one&#39;s claims, and clear, specific examples from the work that are explored, explained, and connected to the writer&#39;s point. The few examples this writer brings up are vague and confusing, making it clear that it never occurred to this writer that there would be a few readers (like myself) who are not familiar with the series. I always learned, when writing essays, to assume the readers know nothing of the issue or piece of literature I&#39;m addressing, because there will always be a few readers who do.<br><br>Now that I&#39;ve said this, I have the sudden urge to lock myself in my room and read every single one of them straight through. I&#39;ll try and wait until winter break rolls around.</p>

            <p>Having read the article and the discussion so far, I&#39;m content to dismiss the article as the drivel it is. As Sylibane points out so entertainingly, the author fails at every turn to support his arguments with evidence, and therefore can be dismissed as a serious essayist.<br><br>I actually considered that it might be a piece of sarcasm, mocking other people who actually do believe those things, but I doubt it. It&#39;s just a screed.<br><br>Now, I do take issue with anyone applying this kind of thinking to a fantasy world. Here&#39;s the thing: if you&#39;re writing about countries that are at war, you are naturally going to characterize the &quot;bad guys&quot; in a way that makes them seem bad to your audience, so they can cheer for your protagonists. If you&#39;re going to tell me that it&#39;s racist to characterize cannibalism and/or human sacrifice and/or serving an evil demigod as bad, or that it&#39;s racist to make people from a hot place have dark skin, then we have a serious problem. Using the prejudice of your audience as a shortcut for that characterization--&quot;brown people = evil&quot; in the absence of any other defining characteristics--that&#39;s a different issue, but I&#39;d like to see the proof for that in Tolkien&#39;s or Lewis&#39; case.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>The article (near as I can tell) is by Philip Hensher, who wrote it for The Independent, which newspaper he is a columnist and book reviewer for. Kathryn Lindskoog is the editor of the journal entitled The Lewis Legacy, in which the article was reprinted.<br><br>That said, while several of the points he makes are sound, the tone of the article leaves a bad taste in my mouth. Hensher <i>vastly</i> overstates his case. I understand that he was writing for a newspaper and therefore impartiality wasn&#39;t really what he was going for, but when you call the subject of your article &quot;ghastly, priggish, half-witted, money-making drivel&quot; I begin to think that you&#39;re either compensating for the weakness of your arguments, or attempting to manipulate me with a kind of appeal to emotion. Personally, I don&#39;t like being manipulated. I <i>really</i> don&#39;t like being manipulated.<br><br>On a personal note, I have burned two books in my lifetime, simply because having them in my house gave me a sick feeling that wouldn&#39;t go away. It was an emotional thing. I didn&#39;t talk to anyone about it, just quietly tore them up and fed them into the fire at a family marshmallow-roasting session. It was extremely satisfying. While there are things in the Narnia series that struck me wrong, they don&#39;t even approach that level. And, furthermore, they&#39;re fun, interesting stories that hold a special place in my heart.<br><br>And with that, I once more retreat into the shadows of Real Life and Lurkerdom (TM). ;)</p>

            <p>In the Appendices to LotR, it is quite clear that the white, racially superior Numenoreans <i>caused one of the greatest catastrophes in the world</i> and that their colonial enterprise in Middle-Earth <i>was concurrent with and contributed with their moral and physical decline</i>. Not merely that, but later in the timeline, the only King of Gondor (a Numenorean remnant state) who actually <i>cared</i> about racial purity was a Complete Monster who nearly brought his kingdom to ruin (but as he discriminated against <i>Blonde-haired</i> people, albeit ones with a shorter lifespan and inferior material culture, that may not count *snigger*).<br><br>As for the Orcs, while Tolkien <i>did</i> describe them as &quot;Mongolian-Types&quot;, he carefully added a parenthesis saying (To Europeans). While further background material (Morgoth&#39;s Ring) showed that he may not have intended for the &quot;Orcs are converted Elves&quot; thing in <i>The Silmarillion</i> to be canon, he still agonized over how Orcs can be &quot;Always Evil all the Time&quot;. <br><br>Speaking of <i>The Silmarillion</i>, background material to it shows that Tolkien had always intended for <i>many</i>, <i>many</i>, Elves to be foolish, violent, and impulsive Jerkasses. That said, the Blonde ones (Finrod Felagund and his family) are the most good of the lot, but they <i>no racism whatsoever to Men, who </i>are <i>racially inferior except for some esoteric gifts</i> (the ability to leave the world after death and to control their own destinies, but those are obviously not genetic). In fact, one of them even sacrifices his life for a non-blonde human so that an <i>interracial marriage</i> can occur.<br><br>Now, back to LotR. While it is true that the Easterlings and Southrons (who may or may not be different from the Haradrim) are described as &quot;Dark Men&quot; under the service of the &quot;Dark Lord&quot; Sauron, the Appendices reveal that said &quot;Dark Lord&quot; had many White-skinned minions as well (in fact, the Cosairs of Umbar were descended from the followers of the Gondorian king I mentioned earlier, the one who belived in racial purity). Not just that, but a noble of Gondor (Forlong the Fat), had Non-Numenorean blood and his followers fought just like the Easterlings. He later dies, but all mentions of him are of a positive nature (all this is omitted in the Tv.Tropes article &quot;Gondor Calls For Aid, which is just sad).<br><br>Not just that, but other examples of Good Easterlings also appear in <i>The Silmarillion</i> and the background material to it reveals that originally, <i>all Easterlings</i> were to be given the chance to rebel against the first Dark Lord, Morgoth. Not merely that, but the Southrons/Haradrim (the supposed african analogues) were established to have been deceived by Numenorean agents (Herumor and Fuinur, I may be misspelling the latter) <i>under the service of the Dark Lord Sauron</i>.<br><br>-End.        </p>

            <p>Okay, this is going to be harder not just because at least one Boarder (Cassie-Cameron-Young) agrees with the &quot;Narnia is misyoginist&quot; position. This is also a reply to some of doctorlit&#39;s points.<br><br>First, the Susan thing. When I read it, I thought that it was Susan&#39;s denial of Narnia and possible descent into materialism that barred her from Aslan&#39;s country, not a supposed growth into sexual maturity as she already had one during her reign as Queen of Narnia (where she was called Queen Susan the Beautiful, and had many princes ask for her hand in marriage). In fact, <i>The Horse and His Boy</i> shows Adult!SexuallyMature! Susan in a positive light, able to make the right decisions regarding future romantic partners.  In fact, the only hint that her ban from the Afterlife resulted from such a cause are lines about &quot;Trying to grow up too fast&quot; and &quot;Only interested in lipsticks, nylons, and invitations&quot; which could be applied to assuming an &quot;adult&quot; image too fast, too soon.<br><br>Then again, Cassie could have heard these points already, so if she makes a reply to this saying so, I won&#39;t make a rebuttal. I&#39;m already distressed that I have to fight with a friend, and don&#39;t wish this argument to continue. Sorry if that was Narm-ish.<br><br>I&#39;m on far better metaphorical ground regarding the Calormenes=Muslims contention, though. To me, the Calormenes are closer to Carthaganians and Babylonians, North African and Middle Eastern cultures that did practice Polytheism and Human Sacrifice (at least as far as Lewis knew). Not merely that, but we also have two Calormene characters that are positively portrayed (Aravis Tarkheena from <i>The Horse and His Boy</i> and Emeth Tarkan from <i>The Last Battle</i>). While that isn&#39;t much, the fact that <i>the Calormenes&#39; capital city</i>, Tashbaan is also a prominent part of Aslan&#39;s Country where only good things go shows that there is room for contention.<br><br>Note however, that those characters have received criticism (Emeth got placed in the &quot;Fox News Liberal&quot; article on Tv.Tropes, last time I checked) and I know I haven&#39;t covered all the bases. So I&#39;ll just leave this part to other people more used to debate, even though I&#39;m still more sure about this.<br><br>Okay, I&#39;m a coward regarding this, and I haven&#39;t even started on how women other than Susan are portrayed (which is also a debate). It&#39;s not in my nature to start a debate, especially against my friends. Not merely that, but I&#39;ve said rash things in the past (especially in the thread about the Anti-Sporking Essay), and I don&#39;t wish to do so on such a charged issue.<br><br>Adieu and Sorry, Wikimaster.       </p>

It&#39;s just that the fact that you (an intelligent person and a good writer) appeared to share the opponent&#39;s side made me less sure of my arguments and that discomfited me. A little. Sorry again!</p>

            <p>I wasn&#39;t offended, honestly. I&#39;m flattered that you have such a good opinion of me, and to be honest I hadn&#39;t really considered things the way they&#39;ve been presented n this thread. It&#39;s given me a reason to start reconsidering my stand on Lewis&#39;s writings. So I guess I should thank you for opening my mind a bit more.<br><br>Thanks! :D</p>

            <p>Calling C. S. Lewis unimaginative?  Oh really?  Makes it hard to take the author too seriously.  One point I do agree on is Susan&#39;s being kept out of Narnia in the end.  It struck me as a sudden chain-yank in the midst of the feel-good uniting of all the former Narnia protagonists.  There was never any previous evidence in Susan&#39;s character of her being less devoted to Aslan than any other Pevensie, though to be fair, we hadn&#39;t seen her for a few years before <i>The Last Battle</i>.  Some of the author&#39;s other points are also at least somewhat justified, like the negative portrayal of the Calormenes as stand-ins for Islamic nations, but the fact is, the <i>Chronicles</i> were all written over fifty years ago, now, and C. S. Lewis can&#39;t help being a product of his time anymore than another person can.</p>

            <p>I had been interpreting Susan&#39;s &quot;turn to lipstick&quot; as a metaphor for sexuality, as others apparently have.  I like Wikimaster&#39;s literal interpretation of materialism better; that&#39;s something I can accept being kept out of Narnia for.  I still don&#39;t like that it came out of nowhere for her characterization, though.<br><br>Sylibane, your mini-MSTing made me have to stifle laughter as my family slept.  It also reminded me another problem I have with this essay(?), namely that it assumes children can be permanently damaged by encountering new ideas.  The author seems to assume children are instantly won over by  a story&#39;s values just because there are fantasy creatures and magic in said story.<br><br>tl;dr: Essay&#39;s author never believed in Santa, is bitter the Pevensies got presents directly from Father Christmas.</p>
