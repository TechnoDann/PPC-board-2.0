            <p>I do like it. It&#39;s not my genre, but I can&#39;t deny it&#39;s well-written. You seem to have the hang of something I&#39;ve never been able to do--the ability to actually tell a story briefly, with all of the words having a purpose, instead of rambling on uselessly. Lucky you! :P Yeah, you deserved the A. I wonder that sometimes because profs will just go, &quot;Oh, it&#39;s all spelling/grammar corrected; give it an A,&quot; but this one deserved it.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m stunned. Simply stunned. Your short story roped me in and held me fast from the very first sentence, and that&#39;s a rare thing for a story to do.<br><br>Somehow, you manage to give density and raw emotion to a character with only a few lines, instead of burying your readers under tons of irrelevant exposition. You don&#39;t tell, you show. And above all, you really made me <i> care</i> about Jason and Emma and Tyler, and feel thoroughly sad about what had happened. You really made me hate Amy. Your characters are <i> people</i>, not just cardboard cut-outs.<br><br>All this, to me, is the mark of true literary talent. I loved it. Bravo.</p>

            <p>I agree with Nesh about the ending not being vague at all.<br><br>Also, I also wish people would learn these lessons.  They never seem to, though.  Alas.<br><br>Now for some talk about the actual work.  I like the format that you chose.  The differences in tone from the guys to the diary, and even through the diary, were distinct, which is nice.  All in all, I think it deserved that A and I would love to see this expanded into a longer piece.<br><br>Well done.<br><br>-Phobos</p>

            <p>The end isn&#39;t vague--not if you&#39;re paying attention, anyway. Just takes a little story math to put it together, which ought to be allowed.<br><br>We <i>weren&#39;t</i> allowed to use that sort of thing as a plot device in the first writing class I was in, because the professor thought it was too easy, too cliched... but I don&#39;t think there&#39;s any other way you could have done it here. It needs that finality to drive home the point. And I think the way you chose for it to happen is good, especially with all the publicity about it. Makes it very plausible.<br><br>Now, I&#39;m sure I&#39;m being vague, but that&#39;s because I don&#39;t want to spoil it for anyone else who might read. Which you should. It&#39;s short, and it&#39;s good, and I think we&#39;ve all experienced some degree of feeling shut out when our friends have new relationships (or doing the shutting out, even). It&#39;s pretty natural to have a period where there just isn&#39;t room for anyone but that new person--but it goes away in time, one way or the other, and it helps if you at least TRY to remember your other friends in the meantime.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

The most logic reasons why I came to the PPC, is these.<br><br>1.    Hopefully make myself better at reviewing, and thereby helping people<br><br>2. Help people<br><br>3.

            <p>You here a sound. It was faint at first, just at the edge of one&#39;s hearing, but as the wind kicked up, the sound came in clearer, louder. A screeching, grinding wail, rhythmically pulsing like the beat of a human heart. A light appeared, shimmering in time, and with every pulse grew brighter. Then, with a clunk and a whir, a large blur police box solidified, the wail petering off into a gentle sub-sonic hum. The Door on the side of the police box opens and a tall thin man pops out.<br><br>&quot;Hello, I&#39;m the Doctor.&quot; To the uneducated observer, this tall thin man looked like some kind of crazed old-fashioned professor, with his tweed jacket and suspenders and bow-tie, but he was too young to be a professor, his hair hair coiffed in some kind of ridiculous pompadour. But his eyes, his eyes gave away what he really was. They were eyes that had seen empires rise, galaxies come into being, stars being born, and all of them return to dust. Eyes that had seen everything. Eyes that right now were looking rather confused.<br><br>&quot;Oh, I am terribly sorry madam,&quot; He said after looking around. &quot;I seem to have wandered into here by mistake. I&#39;ll be going now.&quot; And with those words the man popped back into his box and, in a inverted but similar method to its arrival, the police box vanishes. As the last waves of sound fade an average sized, average blond man in a black duster comes charging around a corner with a black backpack in hand.<br><br>&quot;Think fast.&quot; He says, tossing you the bag as he runs by. &quot;It&#39;s a bag of holding. Have fun and try not to maim anyone.&quot; Just as he finishes he goes around another corner.</p>

            <p>Okay, here I go. Hello, I&#39;m Vadana! After hearing about the PPC from my Aunt, who is Miah here, I had to come and see it.<br>I love LoTR, Ratchet and Clank, Metal Gear Solid, World of Warcraft, and some other fanfictions... I currently have a Ratchet and Clank story I am writing. That I will post sometime in the near future.<br>Well, it&#39;s nice to meet you guys. See you around the board!</p>

One package of plastique, one lighter, and some Skör bars. And because I just finished reading the Fifth Elephant, also a wolfhound.<br>His name is Cedric.

            <p>You here a sound. It was faint at first, just at the edge of one&#39;s hearing, but as the wind kicked up, the sound came in clearer, louder. A screeching, grinding wail, rhythmically pulsing like the beat of a human heart. A light appeared, shimmering in time, and with every pulse grew brighter. Then, with a clunk and a whir, a large blur police box solidified, the wail petering off into a gentle sub-sonic hum. The Door on the side of the police box opens and a tall thin man pops out.<br><br>&quot;Hello, I&#39;m the Doctor.&quot; To the uneducated observer, this tall thin man looked like some kind of crazed old-fashioned professor, with his tweed jacket and suspenders and bow-tie, but he was too young to be a professor, his hair hair coiffed in some kind of ridiculous pompadour. But his eyes, his eyes gave away what he really was. They were eyes that had seen empires rise, galaxies come into being, stars being born, and all of them return to dust. Eyes that had seen everything. Eyes that right now were looking rather confused.<br><br>&quot;Oh, I am terribly sorry madam,&quot; He said after looking around. &quot;I seem to have wandered into here by mistake. I&#39;ll be going now.&quot; And with those words the man popped back into his box and, in a inverted but similar method to its arrival, the police box vanishes. As the last waves of sound fade an average sized, average blond man in a black duster walks around a corner and slows to a stop next to you.<br><br>&quot;Rammu.&quot; He says, looking you over. &quot;You must be new. Please allow me to bless you.&quot; Bowing his head he speaks in a strange and alien language. &quot;Syo ouin pmyta cdyo crynb. Syo ouin yes cdyo dnia. Syo ouin creamt cdyo cdnuhk. Yht syo ouin vuac cdyo tayt. Huf ku vundr, yht vekrd!&quot; As he finishes he traces an odd symbol over his heart and walks off. &quot;Have fun now.&quot; He calls over his shoulder.</p>

            <p>Please remember that it is not necessary to tell us (via a new thread) that you are back, or gone again.<br><br>People are in and out of the board all the time for short spells. And each new thread pushes an older thread of the first page and a very old one into oblivion. We frown on that, so unless it&#39;s the first time you&#39;re here or perhaps the last time, it&#39;s not necessary to mention presence or absence.</p>

            <p>You here a sound. It was faint at first, just at the edge of one&#39;s hearing, but as the wind kicked up, the sound came in clearer, louder. A screeching, grinding wail, rhythmically pulsing like the beat of a human heart. A light appeared, shimmering in time, and with every pulse grew brighter. Then, with a clunk and a whir, a large blur police box solidified, the wail petering off into a gentle sub-sonic hum. The Door on the side of the police box opens and a tall thin man pops out.<br><br>&quot;Hello, I&#39;m the Doctor.&quot; To the uneducated observer, this tall thin man looked like some kind of crazed old-fashioned professor, with his tweed jacket and suspenders and bow-tie, but he was too young to be a professor, his hair hair coiffed in some kind of ridiculous pompadour. But his eyes, his eyes gave away what he really was. They were eyes that had seen empires rise, galaxies come into being, stars being born, and all of them return to dust. Eyes that had seen everything. Eyes that right now were looking rather confused.<br><br>&quot;Oh, I am terribly sorry sir,&quot; He said after looking around. &quot;I seem to have wandered into here by mistake. I&#39;ll be going now.&quot; And with those words the man popped back into his box and, in a inverted but similar method to its arrival, the police box vanishes. As the last waves of sound fade an average sized, average blond man in a black duster walks around a corner and slows to a stop next to you.<br><br>&quot;Rammu.&quot; He says, looking you over. &quot;You must be new. Please allow me to give you a gift.&quot; He hands you a book titled &#39;How to Make Your Own Keyblade by Tetsuya Nomura&#39; and walks off. &quot;Have fun now.&quot; He calls over his shoulder.</p>

            <p>There is a story that I want very, very badly to do a mission on, but right at the end of it, it says one of the canons is pregnant. My only female agent is considerably less than matronly, and I&#39;m not ready right now to deal with the arc that being pregnant would set off.  <br><br>Does anyone have agents that might be willing to take on a pregnancy? It would be a near full length pregnancy. I am pretty sure the character was less than three months along.<br><br>The canon parents are Samantha Carter and Jonas Quinn of Stargate SG-1. Sam is blonde with blue eyes, and Jonas has light brown hair and brown eyes, both are pale complected, tall, and exceptionally brilliant. Jonas&#39; is definitely genetically based. </p>

            <p>Well, I hadn&#39;t made any concrete decisions about the various special knowledges of the character, but yeah, she probably would have some medical experience under her belt.

            <p>I would think about it, but since my only currently available female character a) hasn&#39;t really been introduced yet and b) is a Tok&#39;ra, I&#39;m not sure how it&#39;d work out.</p>

            <p>I would guess that a Tok&#39;ra would work a lot like a Goa&#39;uld. Remember when Sha&#39;re was pregnant, her symbiote (whose name I am forgetting right now) had to go dormant to prevent loss of the pregnancy. I can&#39;t imagine it would be much fun to have to put half of a character into hibernation for six or seven months right after you get the character.</p>

            <p>I am glad you enjoyed it and that you found so many things to be enjoyable/worthy of comment.<br><br>The Kudzu/Marquis pairing has been floating around the PPC for quite a while due to...shady, behind-the-scenes type people.  They shall not be named...for my safety, you understand.<br><br>Also, since the broom-closet has been disclosed, you will likely not find the Sunflower&#39;s Witness there.  She resides in an undisclosed location, as I said in the interlude.  That is why she is so hard to find and apprehend.<br><br>Also, also, I will answer your other post here as well.

            <p>There is very little violence in the Postal Department.  It is an odd thing.  The other agents are more likely to &quot;go postal&quot; than the actual postmen.  Ah well, it is the PPC, after all.</p>

            <p>Hi, everyone!<br><br>Yesterday I&#39;ve made a program that can automatically generate names for characters, places, thing, or really just about anything and I&#39;m putting it up here for you to try out.<br><br>You can download it here: <a href="http://pic.sempre-vigilans.net/up/namegen.jar"><a href="http://pic.sempre-vigilans.net/up/namegen.jar">http://pic.sempre-vigilans.net/up/namegen.jar</a></a><br><br>To run it, you need to have Java installed. Get a list of your favourite names (or just use this one I made: <a href="http://pic.sempre-vigilans.net/up/swtest.txt"><a href="http://pic.sempre-vigilans.net/up/swtest.txt">http://pic.sempre-vigilans.net/up/swtest.txt</a></a> ), open the command line (or bash console, or whatever you&#39;re using) and run it like this:<br><br>java -jar namegen.jar <br><br>The similarity parameter is a number that describes how closely do you want the results to resemble your input. Lower values produce strange (and occasionaly funny) results, higher values resemble the input more closely, but will take longer to generate (a lot of duplicates will come up and be discarded - if you overdo it, it may even seem to freeze up). So, for example, if you download the text file I provided into the same directory as the program, you may run it like this:<br><br>java -jar namegen.jar swtest.txt 7 10<br><br>And you should get a list of names that almost invariably contains &quot;Shmi Skywalker&quot;.<br><br>So please, try it out and share your results and name lists!</p>

            <p>Hey, everyone. So, Miah and I just finished writing a joint mission between Agents Miah, Cali, and Maeryn/Kaliel, and we need at least two betas: One for general SPAG, and the other to check for proper characterization of Season 6 characters of SG-1 (Sam, Jack, and Jonas). Please note that this mission is probably going to be rated M/R when all is said and done, and does contain descriptions of violence, illogically massive injuries sustained (And survived) by a character, and other mature subjects. Please comment here if interested.</p>

            <p>So... pretty much what it says - I need a beta reader for my first mission. It&#39;s for a Lord of the Rings Action/Adventure fic. The original fic is very violent and graphic, but the mission isn&#39;t. I&#39;d love it if someone could check it over and let me know whether or not it&#39;s funny and whether the plot makes any sense at all before I post it up for everyone to see. Also maybe a skim for SPAG, though I have checked it.<br><br>Thanks very much in advance!<br><br>G**</p>
