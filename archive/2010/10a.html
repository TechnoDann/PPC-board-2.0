            <p>It&#39;s rather painfully obvious that while you spell-checked the thing, you blindly hit &quot;replace all&quot; rather than making sure the word made sense - even just the first chapter is full of homonym fun. Technical errors abound - sentence fragments, misuse of punctuation, just straight-up bad wording and so on all call your fic home.<br><br>On a more systemic level, this story has no storyline to speak of. It seems a random compilation of events only connected by the fact that they appear one after another on a page, much like a line of traffic that&#39;s gotten impact-welded together through the process of getting rear-ended by a Saturn V. Say what you like about post-structuralism, I&#39;m a post-post-structuralist, and will continue to complain about it. There is no pacing, no breaks larger than your sentence/paragraph breaks, and nothing whatsoever to make it anything other than a torrent of liquid blah - certainly a nicer torrent than if it had no paragraph breaks, but only marginally so.<br><br>Your characterizations are just plain wrong at multiple levels. On the factual, Gordon Freeman is a physicist, not an artificial intelligence researcher. There are miles of difference between the two. Cortana... I&#39;m not going to touch that one with a ten foot pole. &quot;Darryl&quot; <i>screams</i> &quot;self-insert&quot;.<br><br>Also, what do you have against Yahtzee? Was he hard on a game you liked? Are you just mad that people want to watch him riff on stuff?<br><br>There&#39;s a rule that applies in almost any storytelling medium: Show, don&#39;t tell. Stories flow much better when readers are allowed to experience what happens, rather than being told that &quot;The AI&#39;s next energy projectile wiped out the wall to the right of the Brit&quot;. <br><br>Your chapter lengths are all over the place. Each chapter should be about the same length and advance the story about the same amount - and hopefully be long enough to fill more than one screenful of most monitors.<br><br>Speaking of high-level stuff, your in-line authors notes are jarring and distracting. Your condescending tone and cute names for readers are entirely unnecessary and make me even less interested in continuing to read. I have good books I could be reading - Gibson&#39;s Difference Engine, Stephhenson&#39;s Diamond Age, Doctorow&#39;s For The Win - and they all contain a far better story without the stupid attitude.<br><br>And finally, there&#39;s something you might want to look into called &quot;tone&quot;. Subtle variations in word choice, sentence structure, and careful use of metaphor can give a reader an impression of the character of a work. For example, in the paragraph where I talked about storylines, post-structuralism, and Saturn V rockets, I relied on elaborate, highly visual metaphors to invoke Yahtzee&#39;s reviewing style. Your work reminds me of nothing more than that which my little brother was writing when he was about ten years old. Suffice to say, this is not a favorable comparison.<br></p>

            <p>Actually, I&#39;m a huge fan of Yahtzee.  Needless to say, it&#39;s been somewhat difficult to capture his trademark style.  Those author notes... this is embarassing.  Those were to my co-author.  I meant to delete them, but apparently I&#39;ve missed quite a few.  As for plot structure... you definitley aren&#39;t the sort of person into anthologies or related shor stories, but I guess that&#39;s a matter of preference.  When ZC is complete, I&#39;m sure many (including myself) will look upon the first chapters as intersting--if amateurish--beginning steps.</p>

            <p>Nice try, sherlock, but a well-written short story is a rather good thing. I&#39;ve got a pair of big sci-fi anthologies on my shelf and would love to add a third.<br><br>The point is, short stories don&#39;t <i>free</i> you from structure, they make it <i>even harder</i> to write. Structures that you would normally be free to spend chapters creating have to be constructed in paragraphs, without interrupting the flow of the story. It&#39;s very difficult to do well, and I am quite appreciative of the works of the real masters in the field.</p>

            <p>Good point; the central premise of the fic is the lives and adventures of the characters in Zero City.  There will be major story arcs in the future.  Maybe I wasn&#39;t too clear.<br>Since I likely won&#39;t have time to fix it, the 1st chapter homonym extravaganza will remain.  I regret nothing... except THAT chapter.

            <p>Okay, a few things.<br><br>1) It&#39;s not smart or safe to use your full name online around random strangers. While everyone here is nice (and are hopefully not of the criminal element), it&#39;s not the same for everywhere else. Your parents, if anything, would probably not be very pleased to find out you&#39;re leaving personal information all over the wild internet for people to find.<br><br><br><br>2) Repeated plugging is rude, and annoying.

            <p>Hello there, I&#39;m a newb in that I&#39;ve never participated in the PPC before, however I&#39;m a veteran in that I&#39;ve been RPing, writing Fanart (although I never posted any anywhere) and writing my own stories in my own worlds for years.  This is the start of my sentence of 30 days and 30 nights of pointless loitering.<br><br>Wondering about my name?  Well its a funny story, I was signing up my profile for Xbox live, and was trying all the usual things, Theodren, Kokushibyou, Ajit, all kinds of things and ALL of them were taken!  It got to such a point that I just put in Baron Smashdown out of pure frustration and IT WASN&#39;T TAKEN!  That just BUGS me.  How was something like Kokushibyou taken when something as obvious as Baron Smashdown WASN&#39;T?  So now I use Baron Smashdown in virtually everything because if it wasn&#39;t taken on xbox live it sure as hell isn&#39;t taken anywhere else.</p>

            <p>Unfortunately I&#39;m all out of cupcakes for the moment, but here&#39;s a Pidgin. It works as an emergency-universal-translator-slash-message-carrier! It is mildly intelligent, and can translate almost any language! Unfortunately, it only translates into Fanbrat, so use with care. They are also freakishly hard to kill, so don&#39;t worry about letting any other pet you might have chew on it every once in a while...

            <p>Just to let you know, before anyone else jumps on the issue - if you post a new topic like this, that could easily be added as a reply to one further down (this should have gone in your introduction thread), it pushes an older topic off the front page, and another one after that off the very end of the Board itself.<br><br>This forum doesn&#39;t have infinite space; it&#39;s a rather old design, having been running for several years now, and as such we try not to add lots of new topics at once, or people who don&#39;t check the place very frequently will miss things.<br><br>Nobody&#39;s gonna get upset, I don&#39;t think - many people new to the place make this mistake, but we like to give them a friendly pointer if they do. So you&#39;re fine, no need to apologise, just don&#39;t do it again. :)</p>

            <p>Are you ready to rock? Are you ready or not?<br><br>Hola, I&#39;m Agent S7. I joined the Pit around 2003, slightly underage for joining the site. Over time, though, I started feeling disgusted by the sheer quantity of hideous fanfiction on the site. This, combined with distraction caused by the wonderful, stupid internet, caused me to retire from writing fanfiction.<br><br>I started focusing on schoolwork more, and on my original fiction. And then...I got hooked on TV Tropes. As I wandered across that dread wasteland of infinite links, that Great Enemy of those who use tabbed browsing, I came across Protectors of the Plot Continuum.<br><br>And it&#39;s pretty dang cool.<br><br>I just started reading TOS, and I&#39;m around chapter 7. I&#39;m hoping to become a contributor, too. After all, I&#39;d love to spork some crap-tastic fanfiction.<br><br>So, yeah. Basically I&#39;m introducing myself. I&#39;m Agent S7--or Matt--and it&#39;s been a long time since I&#39;ve joined a forum or anything, so I thought this&#39;d be cool. Nice to meet you!</p>

            <p>And you should have by now a tall ship, a plover, some random orc-vomi- I mean, stuff...<br>Here&#39;s a Storage Area With No Back! Kind of like the shed door in book #7 of Narnia, it just looks like a door from the inside, but the inside surrounds the door... it&#39;s hard to explain...<br>Now you&#39;ll have to go look it up. Hah.<br><br>Other than that bit of shameless Narnia-plugging, would you like a Skцr bar? They&#39;re very good. And I used to give out plastique, but then I realized that you can&#39;t use plastique in a lot of the fandoms. But here&#39;s some Nondescript Clothing- You&#39;ll be using it a lot, probably, since no one around here generally bothers to describe clothing because of the &#39;Suethor fear. <br></p>

            <p>Excellent! XD Thank you!

Even a PPG/Samurai Jack crossover. I always promise myself I&#39;ll go back and finish my PPG epic, but I never do it. Probably because the third installment was awful!

            <p>This? Is a strictly for-fun, no-drama, silly little game we play on the &#39;Board! You do NOT need Permission to play! You do NOT need Agents! (In fact, using them is somewhat discouraged.) Here&#39;s how it goes:<br><br>1) Someone (in this case myself) posts a bunch of fic titles and summaries, in various fandoms.<br><br>2) People write a story to fill the summary, without reading the fic-- generally quite silly. For example, the summary might be something like &quot;Draco and Hermione meet for the first time outside of Hogwarts!&quot; and the &#39;fic would probably concern the snarktastic battle of sneer versus wit, not the FORBIDDEN ROMANCE the author was thinking.<br><br>That&#39;s it! The only thing I will add is that I ask you not post preemptive claims to a number without actually writing the story. Anybody can do it, we <i>can</i> have multiple stories for each [presumed] badfic, and there&#39;s no need to claim something before you write it.<br><br>Without further ado...<br><br><u>Harry Potter</u><br><br>1) Eternal Flame by PrEcIoUs DeSiRe<br><i>It&#39;s their 5th year at Hogwarts.

            <p><i>Legolas feels something for Eowyn. But what could possibly happen between them? Set post ROTK</i><br><br>Possibly a bit serious and I&#39;m not sure how well the finished product fulfils that summary - it sort of grew in the telling, though it&#39;s short - but I like it. :)<br><br>***<br><br>Legolas had actually come to visit Faramir to discuss a minor problem on the border of their respective halves of Ithilien. At least, that was his excuse; he knew he could easily send a messenger, but he liked riding north to the small human realm, and he liked spending time with Faramir and his wife, Йowyn.<br><br>Legolas hadn’t had much to do with Йowyn when he had first gone to Rohan. He had observed her infatuation with Aragorn with a mixture of pity and discomfort; after all, she had been twenty-four, barely more than a child, and nothing good could ever come of her admiration for a man almost four times her age who already had the love of Arwen Undуmiel.<br><br>Nonetheless, he had to admit as he watched Йowyn laughing at something her husband had said, he had been wrong. Her wild, suicidal grief at Aragorn’s dismissal had seemed to confirm Legolas’ rather unflattering opinion of her youth and inconstancy, but she seemed to have marvellously aged in spirit since then. She was a woman now, no longer a child, and worthy of his respect rather than his pity. Faramir was fortunate indeed.<br><br>“You seem quiet tonight, Legolas,” said Йowyn, turning to look at him.<br><br>“Oh, it’s nothing. I was just thinking of how much has changed since we three first met.”<br><br>Faramir smiled, taking Йowyn’s hand. She looked sideways at him and smiled. Legolas also smiled, looking at them. For a little while he had entertained cruel speculation about how quickly Йowyn had looked from Aragorn to Faramir, but now he inwardly shook his head. No, truly this was no longer the child that had looked wide-eyed at a great hero and wished to spend her life at his side.<br><br>And he could not deny his respect for what she had become.</p>

            <pre><code>Draco Malfoy began his seventh year at Hogwarts wearing a gloomy expression at Slytherin table in the Great Hall.  His parents were in a constant state of tension thanks to the increased activities of the Dark Lord.  Draco was happy to get away from home, where the Dark Lord had been staying.&lt;br&gt;   The absence of Harry Potter and his pair of friends from the Gryffindor table was an additional source of relief.  With them on the run, Draco might even be able to &lt;i&gt;enjoy&lt;/i&gt; this last year at school.  All the tables, aside from his own, were obviously missing some of their usual inhabitants.  Draco began scanning the room, seeing what other annoying students he would be spared the company of.&lt;br&gt; It was at his own table that he saw something that made him gasp.  It wasn’t the absence of a face, but the presence of one which had been missing a long time—since Draco’s second year, in fact.  That had been the year Draco and Deanna had admitted they were in love.  Draco hadn’t seen her again after that; and now, here she was again, sitting at the Slytherin table as though she had never been missing at all.&lt;br&gt;   Crabbe and Goyle were too busy eating to have noticed Draco’s gasp, and they paid no attention now as he stood up and walked silently to where Deanna was sitting.  As she turned to him, Draco saw the changes the past four years had inflicted on her.  She was older, of course, taller and with more defined features.  She was also, oddly, far more muscular than the daughter of pure-blood wizards would ever be expected to be.  Deanna’s once pale face was now tan, almost dark.  That face now lit up into a smile as Deanna recognized Draco.&lt;br&gt;“Draco!  I wasn’t sure you would be here!”&lt;br&gt;“Deanna.  Where have you been?”&lt;br&gt;Deanna smiled.  “Well…you won’t believe me.”&lt;br&gt;“Of course!  Of course I will,” Draco said impatiently.&lt;br&gt;“Well…we went to the Arctic.”&lt;br&gt;“…What?”&lt;br&gt;“My family!  We all went to the Arctic during the summer after my second year.  We rented a yacht from a Muggle dealer, and went sailing up to the Arctic.  We went hiking around across the ice, but then we fell through!  There were patterns scrawled into the ice down there, and it looked like goblin!  We thought it might be talking about a treasure, so we memorized what it said as best we could before we tunneled through the ice and back out.  The message said something about Peru, so we got back to the boat and headed for South America.  Another boat showed up on the way, and we thought it would be the Muggle collecting more money for his boat being rented longer, but it was actually Somali pirates!  They were after the treasure, too!  So we had an amazing boat-to-boat duel, with the pirates using guns, and my family using wands!  Mom got shot in the shoulder, but we managed to sink their boat!  We reached the mainland in time to get Mom’s shoulder treated by some “witch doctor” guy, who’s sort of a Muggle that knows about Herbology.  We traded him our snowsuits from the Arctic in exchange for some llamas, which we started riding through the Andes.  We eventually came across an ancient temple, and when we went inside, there were decomposed bodies wearing Nazi uniforms &lt;i&gt;everywhere&lt;/i&gt;!  We kept going deeper, and it looked like the Nazis had triggered all the traps, but I almost got caught in one they had missed, and swords came out and cut me—here, on my chin—but we got past them all finally.  In the bottom chamber of the temple, there was a golden statue of a guinea pig.  Dad picked it up, but when he did, a horrible shriek filled the air, and something started clawing at the back wall.  We all ran out, with this huge &lt;i&gt;something&lt;/i&gt; following us the whole way.  When we got out, the Muggle boat dealer was there, with a bunch of armed men.  It turns out, he had sent the Somali pirates, and had even suggested we go to the Arctic in the first place hoping we would find that ancient message!  His men captured us and took the golden guinea pig, but they didn’t think to take our wands away, and we managed to escape that night.  We stole our llamas back, and tried to get back to our yacht, but the pirates had already taken it aboard their battleship.  Then the witch doctor reappeared, and said that there were more golden animals like the one we found, and showed us a golden llama statue he had had all along!  He said it was important to fins the rest before the pirates did, and told us to head for Mexico next, to look for the golden chicken!  So we started off on our llamas again, heading north, trying to evade the pirates…”&lt;br&gt;Eventually, Deanna reached the end of her tale.  “…the old witch doctor revealed that &lt;i&gt;he&lt;/i&gt; was an alien, too!  Then they all entered the giant spaceship and flew away!”&lt;br&gt;Draco blinked, and looked away.  “So…you’ve been doing drugs for four straight years?”&lt;br&gt;“That too,” Deanna admitted.  She reached across the table, grabbed a poppy-seed muffin, and held it to her nose, inhaling deeply.&lt;br&gt;

            <p>I had to take Eternal Flame. It was too good to pass up! Also, at the end of the post--more stories to Fill the Plothole.<br><br>Eternal Flame: Redux<br>&quot;It&#39;s their 5th year at Hogwarts. This year the school is going to put on the play Romeo and Juliet for the school. Hermione and Draco get the lead roles and all of a sudden weird things start to happen. What will happen between Draco and Hermione?&quot;<br>--<br>    Hermione stood in the hallway for a good minute, staring at the poster in shock. She was, apparently, going to play Juliet in a theater production Hogwarts was putting on. There were a few things wrong with this.<br>    Firstly, Hermione had never signed up for the role.<br> Secondly, Hogwarts had never done a play before. There wasn&#39;t any reason for this; it&#39;s just that it&#39;d never happened. And on the poster sheet there was no Professor listed in charge of the show. There was only a meeting place, an old room near the Divination Tower.<br>  Thirdly, Draco Malfoy was Romeo.<br>     &quot;Hermione!&quot; called Harry from down the hall. Ron walked beside him. Both shared a look of utter disgust. Ron held a scrap of parchment—another poster?—in his hands.<br>   &quot;You&#39;re…in a play?&quot; said Ron. &quot;And Malfoy&#39;s in it too?&quot; <br>  Hermione shook her head. &quot;I never tried out for anything.&quot;<br>  &quot;D&#39;you it&#39;s a prank? It could be,&quot; said Ron.<br>    &quot;But how is it a prank?&quot; said Harry, leaning against the wall. &quot;It doesn&#39;t make sense. If it was a prank by Malfoy, it would call her a M—something nasty and stupid, wouldn&#39;t it? This, though…this is just stupid.&quot;<br>   &quot;This is the weirdest thing to happen this year…&quot; muttered Hermione.<br>  &quot;Things&#39;ll get weirder,&quot; said Harry with a sigh, remembering the nightmare of the Triwizard Tournament. &quot;They always do.&quot;<br>   ***<br>   That night, Hermione woke up to a nasty shaking sensation. And…wind. Wind? In the dormitory? That didn&#39;t make any—<br> She opened her eyes to discover that her bed—by itself—was racing down the corridors of Hogwarts. Hermione screamed as the bed made a sharp turn and sped down a hallway, mowing down a house elf like a bed-based Grand Theft Auto.<br>    Hermione didn&#39;t dare to climb off—it was going too quickly. She glanced below her, wondering how a bed—a fracking BED—was speeding at all.<br>    It wasn&#39;t. The floor itself was rushing around, like some crazy magic conveyor belt. And it was carrying her to a door, and in a second she would—<br>    WHAM!<br>   The door slammed against the wall. The super-bed flew through the door before sliding from under her and leaning against the wall, providing a soft—though still-painful—barrier to break her fall and prevent her from going splat.<br>    She fell unconscious anyway due to shock.<br>   ***<br>  &quot;LISTEN, FOOLISH MORTALS! AWAKEN, ALL OF YOU!&quot;<br>  Hermione managed to open her eyes. Her head throbbed. The room she was in—not the dormitories, but a theater—confirmed that the lightning bed travel wasn&#39;t a dream. She was sitting in a fairly cushy theater chair with several other students.<br>   The supposed &quot;cast&quot; of the &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; production.<br>   On stage, a dark figure waddled back and forth menacingly. A dark figure in the shape of a chair. &quot;I…AM…HOGWARTS!&quot; said the evil chair. &quot;ALONE I HAVE LIVED. SLOWLY HAVE I DEVELOPED A MIND! LIKE YODA I STILL STRUGGLE NOT TO TALK…LIKE. AND NEVER BEFORE HAVE I EVER DONE ANYTHING COOL AND INTERESTING! BUT THIS CHANGES TONIGHT! I—THE SCHOOL—AM PUTTING ON A PRODUCTION OF ROMEO AND JULIET, AND YOU WILL BE FREED ONCE YOU PERFORM IT! AND A CHAIR IS THE ONLY FORM I COULD TAKE FOR SOME UNCLEAR REASON!&quot;<br>  The evil Hogwarts-chair stroked its beard. Well, okay, no. It didn&#39;t. But couldn&#39;t you just picture it? I mean, if he were human and had some sort of goatee. Maybe it would furrow its brow…but that&#39;s irrelevant, because it&#39;s a chair.<br> Sorry.<br>  &quot;SHOULD YOU REFUSE TO PUT ON THIS PRODUCTION, I WILL THROW YOU INTO THE ETERNAL FLAME!&quot; At once the curtains on the stage parted, revealing a huge blue bonfire. &quot;THE ETERNAL FLAME LEADS STRAIGHT TO HELL! NOT JUST ANY HELL…A HELL WHERE YOU ARE READ &quot;my immortal&quot; FOR THIRTEEN THOUSAND YEARS! AND THEN YOUR HEAD EXPLODES. AND TIME REPEATS.&quot;<br>    &quot;What on earth is My Immortal?&quot; snapped Draco. &quot;What are you talking about?&quot;<br>    And the Chair of Hogwarts did throw Draco into the Eternal Flames. There was much rejoicing.<br>    And then Chuck Norris kicked everyone&#39;s ass, and Draco came back, because I&#39;m sick of writing this. However, Hermione and Draco would always have the memory between them of that one crazy night: The night the school tried to put on a production of Romeo and Juliet, and strange things happened.<br>  THE END<br>KINGDOM HEARTS FANDOM<br>&quot;zexion must save everyone from the infection&quot; by zexion12<br><br>Summary: what happens when one of vexen&#39;s experiments goes wrong and a infection is going around that turns peoplae and blood craving zombies that only have the urge to kill and to feed read to find out more,<br><br>&quot;The Magic of Love&quot; by xionrules76321<br>Kairi, Namine, Xion and Aqua are all begining they&#39;re junior year in highschool.

            <p>This looks like...a Halo fanfic. With Starcraft thrown in.<br><br> Also: Moving alien &quot;patforms.&quot; The only good point the author made is how many of those dang things are elevators, for no other reason than it looks cool. I mean, how impractical is that? Do EVAL ALEINS!11 often transport vehicles to places where...vehicles don&#39;t make sense to go? Or crates?

            <p>By the canon, that was harrowing. Every other word was misspelled, Raynor was quite out of character, and the only good thing about it was that it was short.

            <p>All right, everyone, this is my second attempt at launching this RP. However, to make sure nothing goes wrong this time around, allow me to present a short explanation.<br><br>As was the case with Edward Wilder&#39;s recent spambot-RP (which, by the way, is still running), this RP will take place in an imaginary city called the Board, with us, the Boarders, as citizens. As such, the PPC continuum will not be influenced in any way, because we&#39;re playing as <i>ourselves</i>.<br><br>I am also aware that many of the Sues I&#39;ll be referring to are already dead. Since bringing them back would go against PPC canon, this will be an AU RP (oooh, highbrow...).<br><br>A big thank you to Sedri, for kick-starting my brain during <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=203899;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">this conversation</a>.</p>

            <p>It was ten minutes past twelve on a cold October night. The Board, home city of that strange people, the Boarders, was wrapped in sleep, ignorant of the unfathomable horror that was, even now, poising itself to strike from the town&#39;s very heart.<br><br>By the cast-iron gate to the city&#39;s abandoned warehouse district, a solitary girl was leaning against the wall, wrapped in a raincoat that was two sizes too big for her. Around her, all was silent and dark. But far behind her, in one of those derelict buildings, something unspeakable was taking place. One of those buildings, so her contacts had told her, was at this very moment the scene of a gathering of all the worst Sues and Stus that badfic had ever produced.<br><br>They were all there. laura. Enoby Way. Marissa. C*l*br**n. And the guest of honor... was Lieutenant Mary Sue herself. God knew what they were planning, but it could not be good.<br><br>The girl shuddered and drew her coat more tightly around her. She looked at her van parked nearby, filled to bursting with first-class C4 explosives and detonators. Next to it was a literally enormous coil of wire for connecting the charges, generously supplied by Sedri. The girl smiled as she considered the kind of damage <i>that</i> could do. It was a shame Sedri hadn&#39;t been able to stay. She&#39;d said something about having to exorcise the dark matter demons that had taken over her basement. &quot;But,&quot; she&#39;d said, &quot;I might be able to make it later tonight. Not sure, though.&quot;<br><br>SttQ adjusted her sunglasses (a little incongruous at night, it was true, but one had to have some standards), and waited for the Boarders to come. She and Sedri had been working like crazy all day long, trying to alert everyone they could of the impending disaster and the action to be taken. SttQ could only hope that enough people would come to help her carry out the operation.</p>

            <p>At twenty-five minutes past midnight, SttQ, Wik, Lycaenion, Lowtide, Blue Mage and Kyoki were crouched behind a low wall, some distance from the six rather scattered buildings that made up the fish packing plant, watching it. The windows were aglow with urple and wilver lights, interspersed with flashes of blello and glose, causing the Boarders, even the ones with sunglasses, to squint in order to protect their eyes.<br><br>Sounds of sugary harp-music and impossibly perfect voices that set one&#39;s teeth on edge came to them from inside the building, coupled with the sickeningly cloying scent of concentrated rose-water. And, somewhere, there was a hint of... heavy metal and motor-oil? The Stus, of course.<br><br>SttQ felt the hair in the nape of her neck stand on end. She was terrified, there was no denying it. Hell, she wouldn&#39;t have been <i>human</i> if she hadn&#39;t been. But she&#39;d be damned before she&#39;d give up. And she knew that this was true for her team-mates as well. No question. The demons would die this night.<br><br>&quot;Okay, crew,&quot; she said in a low whisper. &quot;Listen up. Each of us will head for one of the buildings, and plant the charges. Remember, C4 is highly malleable, so stuff all the cracks you can find. Make sure you duck when you have to pass a window. Be on the lookout for bits and Cute Animal Friends. Avoid them if possible, and if not, kill them as quickly and silently as you can. If you have low-calibre guns and they&#39;re not silenced yet, hand them over to Wik and he&#39;ll do it for you. When you&#39;re finished, come back here, wire in hand, and wait for the others.<br><br>Also, it is possible that you will hear the voice of your own personal Sueish nemesis coming from the building you&#39;re working on. Ignore it. Repeat, ignore it. Going into a killing frenzy would spell death for us all. And that, I think, is all. Let&#39;s go, and good luck to all of you.&quot;<br><br>With that, SttQ vaulted over the wall and headed for the main building, running inaudibly in the shadows. She caught a few glimpses of the others, as, silent as ghosts, they ran for the buildings they&#39;d chosen. Biting her lip, she prayed everything would be all right.</p>

            <p>((OOC: caution, violence.))<br><br>Edging cautiously around a corner of the irregular building to begin her work, SttQ spotted her first guard, a male bit character. He lacked any and all defining characteristics, as bits have a tendency to do, and most closely resembled a cheap, generic action figure, complete with a heavy machine gun in his hands; it was attached to a strap around his shoulder. He was (thankfully) facing away from her, but she couldn&#39;t possibly do anything while he was around. Only one solution.<br><br>Fishing a piece of cloth from one pocket and one of her razors from another, she crept toward her victim. When she was right behind him, she stuffed the piece of cloth against his mouth to deafen his screams (not that he&#39;d have much time to scream), and used the razor to cut his throat in three quick strokes. He was dead before he hit the ground. Dragging the body into a dark recess, SttQ wiped her razor on one of its sleeves. The last thing she wanted was glitter stains on her weapons, whether said glitter was heavily water-diluted or not. As for the gun, she had no use for that. Far too noisy.<br><br>Satisfied, and not hearing anything else for the moment, she left the recess, knelt down and began her task.</p>

            <p>After two minutes or so, SttQ became aware of a strange sound, right at the edge of hearing. She raised her head. Hmmm, that was weird. A curious rhythmic droning noise.<br><br>She laid her ear against one of the as yet unstuffed cracks. Yup. A kind of low chanting, almost religious. To SttQ&#39;s frustration, it was impossible to make out the words. Perhaps it was just as well. She really didn&#39;t want to know what manner of creature those demons would worship. Nope. Definitely not. Not her.<br><br>She peeped through the crack at the brightly-lit room beyond. The next moment saw her huddled in a heap on the cobblestones, shaking so badly she was almost convulsing. She ripped off her sunglasses and pressed the balls of her hands hard against her eyes.<br><br><i>My eyes... Oh Eru, my eyes! Gah, it&#39;s like someone squirted Mace on &#39;em, I can&#39;t see! Curse your impossible, sight-scorching beauty, Lt. Mary Sue! Curse it, I say!</i><br><br>As her trembling grew less, a horrible realization crept up on her. How in the world was she going to finish this building if she couldn&#39;t even see it?</p>

            <p>When SttQ finally lifted up her face from the night-cooled stones, where she&#39;d laid it to ease the burning of her eyes, she found that she could, in some measure, see again. Everything was still a bit blurry and she seemed to have gone color-blind, but that last part was actually a blessing, in a way. At least now she&#39;d no longer need her glasses for protection against the Suvian colors.<br><br>She&#39;d just gotten started on the wall again, when the chanting on the other side rose to a howling crescendo. She could have sworn she felt a tremor go through the building. What on earth was going on in there?<br><br>[OOC: I&#39;m very sorry for the delay, but I have been <i>so</i> busy getting into a new fandom lately, and writing a cracky PPC interlude.

            <p>The howling died down after half a minute, and a man began to speak. For the first time, SttQ could understand what she heard. Weird; she could actually tell he was throwing down way too many capital letters.<br><br>&quot;Faithful chosen Sues and Stus. Lieutenant Mary Sue, praise be Her Glory, Whose voice I am, thanks you for these signs of your devotion. Soon, loyal ones, the Mother of us all will take Her rightful place as Goddess of this vile, imperfect world, and reshape it in Her own image.&quot;<br><br>(<i>My color-blind eye</i>, thought SttQ.)<br><br>&quot;And rest assured, loyal ones,&quot; the voice continued, &quot;the barbaric wretches who call themselves the Boarders, merciless butchers of our kind since the Great Lieutenant appeared in this world, will be the first to fall victim to Her might. But see, the Beautiful One is clement, and will not kill even these. No, loyal ones, She will merely take their minds, and make them Her faithful servants.&quot;<br><br>(<i>Slit my own throat before I let that happen to me.</i>)<br><br>&quot;Now, loyal ones, we will all offer up another prayer to Her Greatness, and...&quot;<br><br>Another voice spoke then. For a non-Suvian, listening to it was about as sweet as having boiling honey poured into one&#39;s ears. It was the Lieutenant herself.<br><br>&quot;Wait,&quot; she said, making SttQ cringe. &quot;I sense the aura of a low one outside the walls.&quot; There was a collective gasp from her worshippers.<br><br>It took half a second for her meaning to get through to SttQ. When it finally did, her decidedly unepic thought was: <i>Oh, shit, I&#39;m dead.</i></p>

            <p>Wik&#39;s caution soon turned to boredom as he continued to do his work in his assigned building. As he moved to stuff more C4 into the cracks, he heard voices from across a corridor.<br><br>&quot;So, is everything going on as planned?&quot; A male spoke, his voice laden with hypnotic power.<br><br>&quot;Yes, my lord, there has been no detection from the citizens of the Board.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Good. Soon, the final stages of the ritual will be completed several hours earlier than planned, giving us a world where we get everything on a silver platter!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Perfect.

Lieutenant Mary Sue won&#39;t know what is happening beneath her eyes. Soon, <i>you</i> will lead the New Suevian Order into gleaming perfection!&quot;<br><br>The conversation continued for a while, and Wik can see the shadows of the speakers retreat as they moved to another part of the building.

            <p>Wik found  a Gary Stu clad like a Generic Fantasy King, clad in clothes that would have put Louis XIV of france to shame. He and another Stu clad like a Chancellor were chanting as they laid a Sue over an altar, clothed in simple garments that were obviously forced on her.<br><br>The Stu lifted up a knife of Emerald with a golden hilt embossed with onyx globes.

            <p>((OOC: I know, I&#39;m still waiting too. A couple of days ago, I sent messages to Kyoki, TheLowtide, The 9th Blue Mage and Lycaenion, asking whether maybe they&#39;d simply lost interest in the RP. So far, I&#39;ve received an answer from Kyoki, saying that she has indeed not lost interest, but has been swamped in way too much schoolwork. For this reason, her updating will be somewhat spotty. I&#39;m guessing that the others are in similar situations. This being the case, I&#39;ve decided to post something myself (will do so today), in such a way that the others can still make their contributions.

As for extending the barrier, the Blue Mage would have to take most of the burden, though much less so if it&#39;s an energy type shield. As a Warmage-in-Training, I can still use my sword, and as long as I have my wand with me, I&#39;ll still have the power for basic battle spells. I can also cast a silencing spell on pistols, but not on higher-caliber firearms.   </p>

            <p>It was a simple enough calculation, really. SttQ suggested that they avoid using firearms as much as possible to avoid directing attention to them. Wik offered to silence their guns for them. Thus, all she had to do was hand her service automatic to Wik and Presto! Problem solved. So, Lowtide pulled her gun out of its holster, double-checked the safety was on, and handed it over to Wik. &quot;Uh, Wik was it? Could you do me a favor and silence this thing for me real quick?

            <p>&quot;The limit is on the number of shots, not on how long the spell is placed. In fact, it can last for a hundred years if you don&#39;t use it. But since that obviously isn&#39;t going to happen, I think that the magic should withstand either ten shots fired one after the other, or sixteen that aren&#39;t. After that, you&#39;re on your own.&quot; Wik then held up his wand over the pistol, and concentrated. He visualized a blanket of energy enfolding the firearm, dulling the sounds that came from it. <br><br>Whenever a bullet issued forth from the pistol, the blanket would be torn, but its threads would carry the silencing effect across the range of the shot, muffling even the sound of impact. The magic would then reconstitute itself to create another blanket, repeating the process until the final shot expended it completely, the sound overpowering the enchantments. It was a simple battle spell, an adaptation to the spread of new weapons technology. Then he looked up at Lowtide, who was observing the process.<br><br>&quot;There, it&#39;s finished.&quot; he said.    </p>

            <p>a friendly nod, took a deep breath, and addressed her little band of fighters.<br><br>&quot;All right, everyone, here&#39;s the plan. We take as much C4 and wire as we can carry without slowing ourselves down. The big coil of wire is actually made up of several rolls stacked on top of each other. We each take one of those with us, plus a wire cutter. There&#39;s a big box full of detonators on the passenger seat; we&#39;ll take some of those too. I&#39;ll lead you through the gate and to the old fish packing plant, which consists of several buildings. Once there, we spread out, stuff C4 in any crack we can find (remember, it kneads like clay) and connect the charges. When you&#39;ve finished with the last charge, put in one end of the wire you have left, and unroll it behind you as you come back here. We&#39;ll connect the wires to this little reception device,&quot; she took it out of her pocket, &quot;and clear the area. We then retreat to the hills on the edge of town, pick out a comfortable spot and,&quot; she gave an unpleasant grin, &quot;enjoy the lightshow. Now then,&quot; growing serious again, &quot;keep in mind that there will very likely be bit characters and Cute Animal Friends patrolling the area. Take them out as quickly and silently as you can, preferably from behind. <i>Do not use fire-arms</i> unless it&#39;s absolutely necessary. The last thing we want is bringing a murder of Sues down on our heads. Everything clear? Good. Now for your individual orders.&quot;</p>

            <p>At about twelve past midnight, or simply shortly behind Wik, whichever you prefer to think of it as, a rather lanky girl with some rather short dirty blond hair was rapidly looking back and forth, quite obviously worried and just a little bit confused about this whole deal. She had just moved to The Board to attend college so she could be a police detective, and the very first thing she was assigned to do during her internship with the local police was, well, something she wasn&#39;t quite sure about. The detective she was working under had mumbled something about a police attache around his cigar, sent her off to the armory to grab a weapon, and left her to figure out just what in the name of Glod she was supposed to be doing.<br><br>It had taken her about half an hour to complete her paperwork, another ten minutes to get her piece checked out, and another thirty to go back home and grab a weapon she had been given during her welcoming party. After that, she finally read the orders she had been given along with everything else and kicked herself while she got in her car and got driving. if she was quick about it, she wouldn&#39;t arrive more then, say, fifteen minutes late. Somehow, including parking and unloading, she had managed it in twelve. And somehow she still found the time to be cagey about the entire ordeal. What kind of police work involved explicit orders to go in armed for close-quarters fighting, and why were they giving it to her?<br><br>Eventually, she spotted who was supposed to be her contact; a girl in an overlarge raincoat. So, with a deep breath she stepped over to the group and stammered out a greetings... of sorts. &quot;Uhm, hello. My name is Sub-assistant Detective Lowtide, I was sent here at the behest of the police as an attache. I, uh, I wasn&#39;t told anything besides that I was supposed to assist you with something that involved possible combat, could somebody fill me in?&quot; Sub-assistant Detective Lowtide had the figure of a beanpole, a cheap haircut, and was dressed in a shirt and slacks that were maybe half a size too small for her, probably from an old wardrobe. In other words, a college student trying to crimp and save everywhere she could. On her belt was a pistol in a holster, a few spare clips, and what appeared to be a Katana of some sort in its scabbard tied onto a belt loop, which she was nervously fingering while she glanced at the van. With the stuff stuffed into the back of that thing, could you really blame her?</p>

            <p>thought SttQ, <i>we got ourselves a nervous one here. Have to fix that, or she could put us all in danger.</i><br><br>Noting the girl&#39;s nervous glances at the van, she said, &quot;Don&#39;t be afraid. C4 is relatively safe. Lighting it with a match will only make it burn slowly, like a piece of wood, and even shooting it with a rifle won&#39;t make it blow up. Only a triggered detonator can make that happen. Just think of it as molding clay. As for the situation...&quot; She stopped and bit her lip, praying that her explanation wouldn&#39;t cause Lowtide to fly into a complete panic. Finally, she decided to give her (and everyone else) the lowdown in overflowing measure. Addressing the small group, she said,<br><br>&quot;Okay, um... Behind these walls, in the building that used to be the fish packing plant, all the worst Sues and Stus in the history of badfic are currently assembled. No-one seems to know how they got here (though I&#39;m guessing evil summoning rituals were involved), but CIA reports indicate that they have been planning,&quot; here she took a deep breath, &quot;the total Sueification of the world for some time now. They have only gathered here to discuss the final details.<br><br>You can easily see why we have to succeed. Because if we fail, then by tomorrow morning the whole world will have become an urple and wilver nightmare asylum. All living things will have been wiped out by an overdose of glitter, and only Sues, Stus and Cute Animal Friends will be left. This is what we are here to stop.<br><br>As for combat, the best thing would be to avoid it altogether, but this may not be possible. We shouldn&#39;t actually have to go inside the building, but we all know what Sue senses can be like. If those things detect us, there&#39;ll be big trouble. Granted, Sues like, say, laura and C*l*br**n won&#39;t put up much of a fight, but there are also goddess!Sues and ultimate!warrior!Stus around. However, further reports state that their powers have degraded considerably since they entered World One. It seems,&quot; she said with a grim smile, &quot;that the innate coherence of our world is proving a bit too much for them.<br><br>So,&quot; she finished, &quot;shall I outline the plan, or are there more questions about the situation? If so, ask them quickly, because the clock is ticking.&quot;</p>

            <p>At first, Lowtide seemed to calm down a bit. That van wasn&#39;t about to suddenly blow up and kill them all, and that fact was doing small wonders for her nerves. She had even gone as far as to release a small sigh of relief, which the Ironic Overpower quickly punished her for when SttQ told her and everyone else there what they&#39;d be doing tonight. &quot;Wait, Sues and Stu&#39;s, here? But... Isn&#39;t that someone else&#39;s job to take care of? There&#39;s gotta be, like, evil horny fox girls and people that can kill me with just their brains and-&quot; She cut off her tirade in mid-sentence, seemingly for little to no reason at all. But there was a reason for it, oh yes there was. It involved a Harry Potter impersonator she had heard about recently, some sick monster who had a very scary and implausible weapon attached to his-<br><br>&quot;Ohmigod we&#39;re all going to get killed by a crazy kid with a chainsaw for a groin, aren&#39;t we?! I don&#39;t wanna die, I don&#39;t wannadie Idontwannadie!&quot; She was quite visibly shaking at this point, seeing as her imagination was now supplying her with some vivid images that belonged in a Silent Hill game. Her left hand was clutching the hilt of her Zanpakutō while her right was shakily fishing something out of her pocket. It looked like she was about to have an absolute fit at this point, but somehow she managed to fish out a pair of small medicine bottles, unscrew the cap with her other hand, and quickly down a pill, followed by another pill from the second bottle. Then, a few deep breaths later, she spoke back up again. &quot;Um, s-sorry about that, I-I&#39;ll probably be fine in a minute or two. C-can you go over the plan?&quot; She was already starting to twitch less already.</p>

            <p>but as far as I&#39;m concerned, the only thing you need to do is read everything that&#39;s been posted on the thread so far. If, after doing this, you find that the RP is your style, then by all means join in. The more the merrier, no?

            <p>Is it okay if I make up some stuff about myself?

            <p>since your mystical artifact has only one power, and there is a chance of its weakening you when you use it, I don&#39;t see a problem. You&#39;re obviously not Stuifying yourself. (Good thing too, because I would be forced to terminate you.)<br><br>One point, though. Now, I know the sapphire is your idea, but I don&#39;t think water will do much damage in battle. Might I suggest using, say, an acid instead? I checked, and it seems many liquid acids are colorless, like water. Just picture it: a Sue getting a squirt of highly corrosive fluid in her oh-so-perfect face. We can all watch it melt, and smile at the sight. What do you think? Sound good?<br><br>(Also, Wik is a guy.)</p>

            <p>Acid sounds good too, I guess. I just inspiried by the water thing because the Witch from the Wizard of Oz melted when it got on her.

            <p>the Wicked Witch of the West. I completely hadn&#39;t thought of that. Come to think of it, it&#39;s way better than my idea. Acid to the face, for normal humans, is a very bad thing. But, since Sues (and Stus) are essentially demons that have taken on human form, it stands to reason that they can be destroyed by something that does not affect us. Kinda like vampires: according to traditional folklore (which considers vampires to be horrible revenants), holy water wards them off, and they can&#39;t cross running water.<br><br>Know what? Forget the stupid stuff I said about acid. Go with your original plan. Also, I apologize if I&#39;ve given you the impression of being a big, bad, no-fun ogre or anything.

            <p>I&#39;ve thought of the make up thing because it usually hides the real face. Wash that off and you see a bit of the true face. Sues, being unnaturally beautiful, hides their true nature by brainwashing canon characters and bending the universe around their desires in a canon-verse. As a result, no canon character will question them at all and the Mary-sues will live out their fantasies without interruptions. However, remove said powers and beauty, and you have nothing more than a very flat characterization-wise and possibly fangirlish creature.<br><br>It&#39;s okay, SttQ.

            <p>I suggested to SttQ that she might have fun with a roleplay because, as said below, we were jokingly exchanging laughs down on the &quot;what would you blow up?&quot; thread, which in turn started because things were tense and I wanted to lighten things up. It was never meant to be a serious PPC-canon roleplay, just a continuation because she seemed to be enjoying it, and I didn&#39;t have the time, but I suppose I should have been more clear about that. The reason I suggested using the other Board was because it would&#39;ve been hard to find here. <br><br>So if anyone&#39;s going to insist on throwing around blame or criticism, don&#39;t direct it at Sister-to-the-Queen, okay? </p>

            <p>... why don&#39;t we let this happen? Yeah, it&#39;s dramatic, but that&#39;s the point of RPs, right?

            <p>...such works of drama tend to have big repercussions for the entire PPC.

            <p>it wasn&#39;t meant to be a PPC interlude (because I&#39;m aware of the effects that would have on PPC canon), but a Board interlude, with the real us, the Boarders, as participants.

            <p>I like the Board quite a bit; I&#39;ve made some truly great friendships through here, and it&#39;s taught me a lot about humour and character development, too.

            <p>It was ten minutes past twelve on a cold October night. The Board, home city of the PPC, was wrapped in sleep, ignorant of the unfathomable horror that was, even now, poising itself to strike from the town&#39;s very heart.<br><br>By the cast-iron gate to the city&#39;s abandoned warehouse district, a solitary girl was leaning against the wall, wrapped in a raincoat that was two sizes too big for her. Around her, all was silent and dark. Behind her, in one of those buildings, something unspeakable was taking place. One of those buildings, so her contacts had told her, was at this very moment the scene of a gathering of all the worst Sues and Stus that badfic had ever produced.<br><br>They were <i> all</i> there. laura. Enoby Way. Marissa. C*l*br**n. And the guest of honer... was Lieutenant Mary Sue herself. God knew what they were planning, but it could not be good.<br><br>The girl shuddered and drew her coat more tightly around her. She looked at her van parked nearby, filled to bursting with first-class C4 explosives and detonators. Next to it was a literally enormous coil of wire for connecting the charges, generously supplied by Sedri. The girl smiled as she considered the kind of damage <i>that </i> could do. It was a shame Sedri hadn&#39;t been able to stay. She&#39;d said something about having to eradicate the evil gummi bears that had taken over her basement. &quot;But,&quot; she&#39;d added, &quot;I might be able to make it later tonight. Not sure, though.&quot;<br><br>SttQ adjusted her sunglasses (a little incongruous at night, it was true, but one had to have some standards), and waited for the Boarders to come. She and Sedri had contacted everyone they could to alert them of the situation. SttQ could only hope that enough of them would come to help her carry out the operation.</p>

            <p>So, I had an idea for an intentional-badfic type parody, a la the sort at Fanfic Land or similar, which my Bad Slashers could take on for the &quot;non-assassination mission&quot; challenge. All my missions so far have been done on real, or presumably-real, badfics, but a few agent pairs have taken on intentional ones written by themselves (e.g. Rena and Shay). However, I am not confident in my abilities to write convincing badfic, nor am I sure I could make it horrible enough to be funny.<br><br>I had the idea of writing it as the bullet-point notes written by one of the agents in the process of assembling a chargelist, so we only see it through his/her eyes.

            <p>A first person account of a mission is something that could be really funny, particularly if you show two things: commentary from the agent him or herself, and a steady degeneration in the agent&#39;s demeanor from the beginning of the mission to the end. You know, starting with ordinary things like:<br><br>-- Unnecessary repetition in fic title. Contacted Department of Redundancy Department.<br>-- Your/you&#39;re confusion. Administered half a tablet of Bleeprin to self.<br><br>Then moving on to items such as:<br><br>-- Canonical character now has breasts twice as large as normal. Forced to restrain partner.<br>-- Canonical character said something both OOC and offensive to modern sensibilities. Injured arm in effort to restrain partner again. Must remember to visit Medical after mission.<br>-- Viewed something really horrible, ate more Bleeprin, forgot what something in question was. Partner refuses to tell me and instead only muttered a string of curse words.<br><br>And so on.</p>

            <p>I was thinking the fic&#39;s a crossover with something S&amp;S aren&#39;t familiar with, and the only person they know who knows anything about the canon and is currently free to go with them is Molly, who, at the time, is aged about seven. So they have to simultaneously show her bits of the mission for charges and keep her away from the unsuitable bits, which, given that it&#39;s Bad Slash, would be a lot of it.</p>

Wait, three new characters if you count the... uh... well, like I said, you&#39;ll see.<br><br>Thank you, TheLowtide, for beta reading.</p>

            <p>I want to apologize for not having read your missions before this. I just finished all of them, and they are great. I loved the crazy CADS from the earlier missions. I don&#39;t know Happy Tree Friends at all, but those replacement Evil Flippy badfics were awful. The missions were funny, though. <br><br>After I caught up on reading them, I can much better understand Deuce&#39;s statement to Caleb at the beginning of this one. Why would someone think that was a good idea?<br><br>I loved the scene Adder walked in on at the end of this fic--especially since it was just ten minutes later. Lucifer should be a <i>very</i> interesting addition to the RC. Oh, and poor Kieran! I think Molly traumatized him. </p>

            <p>I&#39;ve got to hand it to you: When I first read that Caleb would be a Twilight-pire, I thought it would be all jokes about sparkling and romance.  But you&#39;ve managed to write a convincingly strong and frightening vampire and agent character.  So kudos for that!</p>

            <p>First of all, greetings to Tranum, TheLowtide, Sylibane, Sasparilla Jones, and anyone else who might have introduced themselves lately whom I haven&#39;t already said hi to. My newbie-greeting gifts are a Capillary Towel, an egg, a Transdimensaional Pocket Knife and a shiny Sue-slaying spear - and you can decide amongst yourselves who gets what (I warn you, the Transdimensional Pocket Knives seem terribly unpopular. No idea why).<br><br><br>Second, my request. It seems none of you lovely shiny new people have been given The Links. Now, this is hardly mandatory, and you seem to be finding everything fairly easily anyway, but over the past few months it seems to have become a tradition to the point of being expected, yet aside from myself, July, and Neshomeh, I don&#39;t think many Boarders actually go around giving out The Links. Please, everyone, don&#39;t feel like you can&#39;t snitch the list - they&#39;re hardly <i>mine</i>, or anyone else&#39;s. I can&#39;t recall who first started giving helpful links out - was it Sara? Trojie? July? Someone whom I&#39;ve forgotten and will be quite embarrassed to be reminded of?<br><br>Given how useful they are, I&#39;d appreciate it if I didn&#39;t feel like I have to be around all the time just to hand them out to newbies - my real life is getting steadily busier. Hence <u><b>my request: If we want Link-giving to be a standard part of welcoming new community members, will the majority of you please make a habit of doing so yourselves?</b></u> <br><br>Do note the &quot;if&quot; - if most people here think Link-giving is a bad or otherwise uninteresting idea, fine; no worries.

            <p><a href="http://twistedskein.webs.com/PPCHome/Constitution.htm">Check the URL</a>. The Constitution (not to mention the PPC Main Page, useless though it is) is no longer hosted on Oddlots (mostly because Oddlots no longer exists :(). I stole it and put it up on one of my sites. That means two things:<br><br>1/ In direct contradiction of the Wiki article on it (which, why do you link to the Wiki, not the Constitution itself?), the Constitution is now at least theoretically signable again.<br><br>2/ And more importantly, if it&#39;s agreed to be a good idea, we can add an appendix of Useful Links to it.<br><br>Note the &#39;Useful&#39; there. I should hope it&#39;s understood that the PPC isn&#39;t a research project; it&#39;s a fun thing. You don&#39;t actually have to devote several hours to reading up on it before participating. The Original Series is something you should read (although didn&#39;t Pads say she never had?), but you&#39;ve got five links there which are all about writing missions.<br><br>I think this is one of those things which has drifted in gradually, but it seems to be assumed that everyone with an interest in the PPC wants to write for it as soon as possible. That isn&#39;t the case. Some of the biggest names in PPC history never wrote a single mission (heck, as far as I recall, /none/ of the original three permission givers - Miss Cam, GreyLadyBast and Thalia - did so). We&#39;re <i>not</i> just a community of writers - we&#39;re a Board of people who enjoy reading a particular set of stories and sympathise with the aims behind it. Yes, many of us <i>do</i> write, but don&#39;t let&#39;s give the impression (which is the one I&#39;m getting from many welcome posts) that the only reason to join the Board is to hang around a month and get permission to write.<br><br>I&#39;m going to restate this: <b>You don&#39;t have to read those links</b>. They are <i>not</i> mandatory. Five of them are barely useful unless you plan on writing a mission. It is <b>perfectly acceptable</b> to join the Board, read TOS and the Constitution, and <b>never set foot on the Wiki</b>. A wiki is a tool for looking up information when you need it. 99% of the data on the Wiki can be obtained by reading the missions it comes from. (Yes, with the PPC Wiki there&#39;s always a little new stuff floating around - like I said, It&#39;s Fun). I&#39;m starting to feel like the PPC treats its old missions like I do the Silmarillion - as a research tool, but not something you read much.<br><br><hr>
<br><br>Okay, summary, since I got a bit tangled up in there.<br><br>1/ The Constitution is now editable, if we want to a) sign it or b) add a Useful Links Appendix.<br><br>2/ The PPC Board is about enjoying the Original Series and/or other PPC stories, not necessarily about needing to write your own.<br><br>3/ The Wiki is a tool which cannot replace the stories its information is gathered from. If you need to know something for something you&#39;re writing, use it. If you want entertainment, read a story.<br><br>hS<br><br>(And, Sedri - I appreciate your reasons for posting this, but your execution feels a bit like you&#39;re giving orders. I know you aren&#39;t, but the way you presented it, in spite of the disclaimers, sounds a bit that way. ~hS)</p>

            <p>For the rest, though, while I see where you&#39;re coming from, there&#39;s a reason the welcome posts assume that people want to write ASAP: we actually DO get a lot of people who show up wanting to start writing right away, sometimes without having a clear idea of what we&#39;re about. There&#39;s less of the last now that we&#39;ve made some changes to how we present ourselves in places like TVTropes, but even so, with the volume of new people we get every month, I think it&#39;s helpful to everyone to have something we can point to and say &quot;this is what we are (and aren&#39;t) about. Please understand these things before you commit your time.&quot; That way we don&#39;t have to keep explaining them over and over. It saves trouble.<br><br>Also, I&#39;ve noticed that a lot of people actually find the Board by way of the Wiki, not the other way around. It&#39;s sort of taken the place of Oddlots as our front yard, and as such, it does serve the purpose of defining us and pointing people in directions that will be helpful/fun for them. Not setting foot there ever means missing out on the best way we have to find the stories and other, more obscure things like the Handbook. Going there may not be mandatory, but it sure would be silly to avoid it altogether.<br><br>Of course, nothing is any substitute for actually reading the the stories and hanging out here. And you&#39;re absolutely right that no one HAS to write. If those things aren&#39;t coming across, we are definitely doing something wrong.<br><br>~Neshomeh, who would love to discuss this stuff further, but will be gone for the weekend. There&#39;s always e-mail?</p>

            <p>While I had set up the wiki in the first place, it was to collect info that had been hard to find because of the dozens and dozens of places where something that might be handy to know had been mentioned once, and while someone knew what it was, they didn&#39;t know where it had first shown up or exactly what it did or the finer details.<br><br>From there, it kinda exploded. <br><br>I never intended the wiki to overtake the reading of actual missions, or to strip the humorous context out of anything, or be meant as a replacement for actually reading anything in the first place- using the wiki instead of going through and reading for what you want is cheating, pretty much. You&#39;re not bothering with the context it was in, and that pretty much ruins part of the point of the PPC (besides the humor); reading about something is never a good replacement for reading that something in the first place, and to be quite honest when people accept it and even encourage it, it rather pisses me off.<br><br>Also, it&#39;s rather ridiculous that we have all these mission writing guides on the wiki, because the best way to learn how to write PPC missions is to <i>read more than a single one</i>. Maybe even check out missions from multiple people. (This is such a radical idea, isn&#39;t it?)<br><br>The fact that we think we need several mission writing guides says something rather poorly about the quality of newbies we are getting- or rather, our opinion of them.</p>

            <p>Mission-writing guides aren&#39;t a substitute; they&#39;re a supplement, and they serve a very valuable purpose.<br><br>1. Reading missions doesn&#39;t always let the reader know all of the work that goes on, as it were, behind the scenes. It doesn&#39;t really explain exactly what type of badfic makes a good mission, or how long something should be, or general points of etiquette (like the DBS&#39;s &quot;you can&#39;t charge for using a kink that disturbs you&quot; rule), or how things like co-writes are organized.<br><br>2. Mission-writing guides help to organize and articulate what you&#39;ve learned. How many of us have ever been in a situation where we can look at something and say &quot;That&#39;s right,&quot; and look at something else and say &quot;That&#39;s wrong,&quot; without ever being able to say what really makes the difference? And reading more doesn&#39;t always fix that; it can make it easier to tell what&#39;s right from what&#39;s wrong, but it doesn&#39;t mean we learn to articulate the difference. The guides are an enormous help with that. They let us know how to reach our goals.<br><br>3. As galenfea pointed out, what if the issue didn&#39;t come up in something we read? The PPC is sort of... big. It&#39;d be pretty hard to read the entire thing in just a month. This prevents misunderstandings wherein a part of our story contradicts something from a fandom we don&#39;t know, or a department we don&#39;t like, or an Agent we haven&#39;t heard of because their owner dropped off the board three years before we arrived.<br><br>4. So, you&#39;re a writer. You&#39;re fairly new at this, you&#39;re nervous, you&#39;re scared of doing something wrong, and you are utterly stuck at this one point. You&#39;re sure someone else has had this problem, but you haven&#39;t seen it yet. Which would you rather do: Spend three weeks frantically combing missions, trying to find one with a similar situation, or check the mission-writing guide and carry on?<br><br>5. It calms the nerves. Mission-writing can be daunting; it can be amazingly soothing to have a helpful little list of advice to check whenever that little voice at the back of your head announces &quot;You&#39;re doing it wrong!&quot;<br><br>Frankly, I think it&#39;s pretty unfair to assume that everyone who uses a mission-writing guide is too lazy and stupid to read missions. It&#39;s a hurtful and groundless accusation. Yes, you and the other Oldies got by without them, but why make every last PPCer re-invent the wheel?</p>

            <p>To rebut:<br><br>1) That&#39;s what practice is for. You learn through experience,  mistakes made. Just because one type of badfic works well for someone else does not mean it will work equally well for you. You write until it is as long or short as is needed, one cannot merely stick with a predefined length for a story. Cowrites happen differently for everyone.<br><br>2) Again, practice. Not everything is going to be ace for a first mission and with a mission guide, several of them, it helps lead to the expectation that it will be ace.<br><br>3)Then you read more. End of story. The month is not hard defined. It is there as a suggestion, because if you are truly active in the community, then you will be known at that point on the board, people will have developed opinions of you, and have a good idea of if you&#39;re a decent fit, whether or not you have read everything. It isn&#39;t when you have to ask for permission either, a clear defined time. I took several months before I asked for permission, myself. People counting down the exact month are fooling themselves because it is possible to wait longer if you don&#39;t feel you know everything you want to know before you dive in. <br><br>Additionally, the PPC is a thing of contradictions with a common tie- the original series.<br><br>4) You dive head long in! Try writing! Thinking! Doing that thing that is necessary for fictional writing, using your creativity to come up with new ways and ideas. If you can&#39;t find something, come up with your own solution! The execution relies on how well you pull it off, not on some random thing someone else said. If you <i>have to rely</i> on a writing guide continuously to pump something out because you don&#39;t want to read the stuff that the guide is based on, you&#39;re probably not as interested in being a PPC writer than you think you are.<br><br>You are making it sound as though having a writing guide at your disposal is necessary and needed and something one needs to be able to write something so simple. <br><br>5) To hell with nerves! That&#39;s something everyone goes through! Ask someone who is actually existent, don&#39;t check a writing guide, because it&#39;s possible to completely get it wrong if you&#39;re hewing completely to foolish technicalities instead of using your brain or asking people their opinions. Betas are used for a reason.<br><br>And finally, did I say you were too lazy or stupid? I am not aware I did, so don&#39;t say I did. Please do not put words in my mouth. If you think otherwise, you are being far too sensitive to simple words that have no ill intent intended.<br><br>Reread what I said: <br><br>&quot;The fact that we think we need several mission writing guides says something rather poorly about the quality of newbies we are getting- or <i>rather, our opinion of them.</i>&quot;<br><br>Additionally, I remembered that disclaimer I promised to give from time onwards: These are just my opinions, they are not fact, I mean what I say, do not interpret it as sarcasm or vitriol. </p>

            <p>1 &amp; 2. Obviously, practice is important. But why reinvent the wheel? If there&#39;s certain basic tenants of Good Mission Writing (and I think we can agree there are), it&#39;s flat-out pointless to make everyone figure them out over eight or so missions.<br><br>3. And so we might, and many do. I didn&#39;t ask for permission until I&#39;d been around a good three months or so, if memory serves. But just because we have read enough to get started, and to handle most missions, doesn&#39;t mean we&#39;ve read enough to cover every situation. Have you actually read every last mission in every last department?<br><br>4. I&#39;m not sure you got what I was trying to say. Allow me to try to rephrase. Of course I want to <i>read</i> the missions - for enjoyment, for research, for experience. But I do not want to frantically look through, say, the entire DBS to check one little detail, because we want to keep everything tied together as best we can and acknowledge the standards others have set. I value the universe that others have built here, and I want my works to merge with as much of that as possible, not just the original series. <br><br>5. What Sedri said. I&#39;m very glad you had such confidence. Some of us don&#39;t.<br><br>6a. Okay, so you didn&#39;t outright call us lazy. But you flat-out said that it&#39;s insulting to imply someone could find a writing guide useful. If that&#39;s insulting, that means it&#39;s bad to find a writing guide useful, doesn&#39;t it? And if that&#39;s the case, then people who use them are doing something wrong, right? That&#39;s the implication here, and all of your indignation just makes it sting more.<br><br>6b. &quot;<i> ...you&#39;re probably not as interested in being a PPC writer than you think you are.</i>&quot; No possible way that could be construed as hurtful, of course.<br><br>7. This is basically my entire argument for this post: <br><br><b> I never said they were <i>necessary</i>. I said they were <i>useful.</i></b></p>

            <p>Or Respetable. I&#39;m neither, incidentally.<br><br>1/2: No, it is not flat out pointless. The best learned lessons are learned first hand when it is possible, and that goes for writing as well. Skipping steps does not serve you well.<br><br>3: Yes, I had read every single mission in every single department that had been readable at the time that I had asked for permission.<br><br>4: Okay.<br><br>5. I&#39;m rather lost as to why you would lack such confidence. Your writing is good.<br><br>6a: It is rather odd then, that until rather recently, there had been no mission writing guide, nor had there been such vehemence in standardizing everyone.<br><br>6b: There is a reason I said that I did not say anything to be taken as hurtful. I am well aware that it could be taken as hurtful, which is why I said that I did not intend it as such. That doesn&#39;t mean that it automatically is not hurtful, but I would hope it makes it clear that I did not say it in malice.<br><br>Additionally, at one point, very few people who got permission made it past even one mission; fewer still past three. In a majority of the cases, I would say that it is due to an actual lack of interest, so I would not say that it is especially untruthful, my statement.<br></p>

I, for example, have every intention of getting to more missions, but when I&#39;ve had time to write I usually haven&#39;t felt capable of that kind of lighthearted yet serious writing. There are more factors than just &quot;they didn&#39;t want to write more missions.&quot;</p>

            <p>1/2: Writing, in and of itself, is an experience. There are many ways to get there, and it all depends on you. The same does not apply to learning your colors or how to do a math problem.<br><br>3. August to December of when I first joined. <br><br>5. If you have permission, a permission giver thought you wrote well. Therefore, if you have permission, there is at least one person here who thinks you are a good writer.<br><br>6a: The PPC has been around for quite awhile.  I would like to say late 2001, or 2002. I can&#39;t quite pin it down at the moment. Up until rather recently, the only writing guides, as it were, were other people. People are, by and large, far better than a prewritten screen on a page  outlining every single step for you and anyone else who might go and read it. <br><br>I likely should have elaborated on this in my first reply.<br><br>If you have to rely on a writing guide, you are doing it wrong because you are relying on something that is static. You are ignoring the community. There is a community here. Or at least, I thought there was. <br><br>If we rather foist newbies at a writing guide instead of getting to know them better through chatting or answering their questions directly we are doing it wrong, and there must be something wrong with one side of the equation; either the new people or our opinion of them.<br><br>I disagree with the idea of a writing guide for the PPC because it does several things:<br><br>It enforces a static formula, no matter how nice and open the writer tried to make it.<br><br>It eliminates what I think is an important step- I&#39;d rather see what you want to try, personally, than what you think the PPC would like (or dislike intensely) because of what you saw in a guide. <br><br>It takes the community out of the equation. The Board, as of late, has been filled to the gills with introduction posts, people saying they&#39;re leaving for awhile (that no one especially cares about because you haven&#39;t posted all that much lately anyways and we thought you were already gone), people saying that they&#39;ve come back (that no one else especially cares about because we&#39;ve been so busy greeting newbies that we didn&#39;t even notice you had disappeared in the first place), or going oh noes at badfic. <br><br>We haven&#39;t had a game of Fill The Plotholes for ages, nor any actual interesting discussions about things not related to bad fanfic or the PPC since who knows when. <br><br>With a writing guide, we are streamlining the process of getting to know each other out of the way because it eliminates a large aspect of getting to know each other. A bunch of questions that might have been asked to a member who has been around longer (or just think they have an answer to the question) are now not asked. There&#39;s no need to any longer.<br><br>A writing guide streamlines the creative process. I like reading missions that are bumpy and lumpy and haven&#39;t smoothed all the internal edges out yet. They are different, the writer is doing something different, because while they might have read missions (in some number between one and a thousand), there wasn&#39;t some thing telling them the exact steps, or they had some wild and crazy idea that they decided they wanted to use.<br><br><br>6b: No. That is not the argument. What I&#39;m trying to say is that I am not trying to be hurtful. It is not fine if people are hurt by what I say. But I&#39;m not going to go out of my way to soften what I have to say just so someone&#39;s ego is not bruised or rattled a bit because I go in with the expectation that people prefer honesty to disingenuous words. Lying and telling people only what they like to hear is the worst and cruelest thing you can do in an environment which is intended to espouse the idea of creativity and quality. Or would you rather I accompany everything I say with a pat on the back?<br><br>I said interest. Not not wanting to write. Many of those people who wrote the single missions posted them immediately after they got permission, and then never returned to the board in general. You have not written anything new for quite some time, but you are still here. I have not written anything for months, yet I am still here. Vixenmage has been here for years and years, and she has permission, and is a permission giver, in fact, but has never produced a spinoff. <br><br>Producing but one (or three or two) missions right after getting permission and then disappearing soon after speaks for a lack of interest.</p>

            <p>I don&#39;t think that they eliminate or replace the community (although they do mean the same person isn&#39;t asked the same question 80 times by 80 different newbies). I think they work in tandem with and support the community, enhance the process and make things easier without worsening the process. You, clearly, do not and will not see it that way. If you really think that the useful guides should go away, then let&#39;s put it up for a vote. I&#39;ll make sure to copy-paste them to Word for personal use.<br><br>As to the nerves issue - nerves and low confidence aren&#39;t really rational. &quot;This person thinks you write well, therefore it&#39;s all fine&quot; doesn&#39;t work at all; there&#39;s still that dispiriting voice saying &quot;you&#39;re doing it wrong, you&#39;re doing it wrong, just stop&quot;. Furthermore, the same person can write great things and dreadful things - Cassandra Claire, for example.  As Sedri said, you can&#39;t just magically feel fine about your writing.</p>

            <p>I said that <i>I</i> can&#39;t just feel fine about my writing and that it&#39;s very likely some other people are the same way, not that pretty much everyone is that way. You probably didn&#39;t mean that, but I don&#39;t want to be the cause of <i>another</i> misunderstanding. <br><br>That said, I doubt July is actually suggesting that the guides be deleted, but if so, I do protest - they were quite eagerly accepted when I wrote them. <br><br>Also... does this issue have to be driven into the ground? I think it&#39;s clear that there&#39;s not going to be mutual agreement, and... well, I hate arguments, particularly when I&#39;ve managed to fumble my way into starting one without even realising. It&#39;s why I&#39;m more or less avoiding the Board right now. </p>

            <p>You&#39;re asking too much, July. You can&#39;t just say &quot;to hell with nerves!&quot; and expect everyone to dive headlong into something. <i>You</i> could do that - and I envy you for it. I couldn&#39;t, and it sounds like Wide Eyed Idealist has the same trouble. I know I said this in my other reply, but it&#39;s worth repeating. Yes, reading a lot is important and I&#39;ll never deny that, but I still come across situations when writing that I need to look up details on, and it&#39;s very hard to know where to look - not to mention that there are contradictions in exisiting material. It has nothing to do with not being able to think, unless you&#39;d like to accuse me personally of that failing.<br><br>Also, if I were a newbie and someone handed me all these things, I wouldn&#39;t feel insulted by their supposed opinion - I&#39;d be very grateful. I need those things. You can&#39;t make sweeping judgements based entirely on how <i>you</i> would react. And yes, of course, there will be people who come along that ARE like you and who WOULD be insulted - and that&#39;s why hS is right and we need to make it clear that newbies don&#39;t have to read every single Link to be allowed entry. They&#39;re there so that if people get confused they will know where to look for answers before posting a question on the Board. <br><br>And I&#39;ll give the same disclaimer as you - these are my opinions, based on how I reacted to what I read in your post. There&#39;s no sarcasm or vitriol; I just want to make my point of view understood.<br></p>

            <p>I can&#39;t speak for everyone and I hope I&#39;m not misinterpreting what you mean, but I personally found the Mission Writing Guide page on the wiki really useful as a quick FAQ page, especially when I was first creating my agents. I&#39;ve read a lot of missions by many different people, but they&#39;ve almost all been in the Tolkien fandoms (one or two in Harry Potter and Narnia) and I like to know whether I&#39;ve not seen something because there&#39;s a rule (spoken or unspoken) against it, or just because no-one&#39;s done it, or because I missed the mission that featured it, whether because it&#39;s not in one of my fandoms or because I just missed it.<br>Maybe the &#39;Mission outline&#39; section is unnecessary, but I&#39;m not certain it&#39;s fair to imply that anyone who needs that page is just too lazy to read more than one mission before writing their own.</p>

            <p>That&#39;s exactly what the Mission Writing Guide was meant to be for - I&#39;m glad it was helpful. The mission outline bit really just grew out of what was already there, because I, when I first started writing missions, really needed that kind of outline just to know I wasn&#39;t doing anything &#39;wrong&#39;. July, I see what you meant, but there are lots of different kinds of people with different approaches to writing, and though I&#39;m sure most can do what you do - that is, just read a lot of missions before making something in a similar vein - I couldn&#39;t. I&#39;m sure I&#39;m in the minority, but I had to nag Trojie and Pads for very specific &quot;do&quot;s and &quot;don&#39;t&quot;s before I felt ready to write. I wrote the mission guide - particularly the outline - in order to help anyone else <i>like me</i>.</p>

I&#39;ve got little to no clue what it does, but eh, whatever.</p>

            <p>Hi there!<br>I discovered the PPC a few days ago and started archive-binging. I absolutely love it. There&#39;s so much to read, though. I wonder how long it&#39;s going to take me to finish it all.</p>

            <p>Oh, wow...you guys are pretty friendly.<br>Some of the fandoms I&#39;m most into are Pokйmon, Harry Potter, and Warriors (though I&#39;ve started moving away from that one, seeing the direction the series has been going recently). I&#39;m sometimes into Warcraft (aka whenever an expansion&#39;s just come out/something plotworthy&#39;s happened) and Lord of the Rings (generally depending on my mood).<br>And yes, I have read Da Rules.</p>

            <p>That&#39;d be some seriously heavy symbolism, right there. One of those times where you <i>have</i> to wonder what metaphor the author was looking for (and then realize you&#39;d have to first know the thematics of the entire story).<br><br>Like stone walls: at least, in New England, they&#39;re an obvious metaphor for the marching-on and keeping-of-traditions, often without fully understanding -why-. Stone walls were important, back in the day! And they were built by farmers chucking stones out of their way as they endlessly plodded through their stony, stony fields, and they took an art and skill that&#39;s mostly lost. People don&#39;t generally tear them down, so you see them criss-crossing all over the place, long-forgotten property lines and boundaries coursing uselessly through a young wood (&quot;young,&quot; of course, meaning 100 or so), and people remark on the scenic beauty-- forgetting, exactly, <i>why</i>.<br><br>...Ahem. Uh, off-topic? What&#39;s that?<br><br>Me? I&#39;d blow up an iceberg, out in the middle of nowhere. Pretty things, icebergs. And the outer parts would hopefully be far enough away from the blast that they wouldn&#39;t melt-- shards of crystalline ice just flying everywhere. Kinda awesome.</p>

            <p>The Boosette incident happened a few months ago, when a LiveJournal user by that name essentially wrote an essay accusing us of being both misogynistic and bullying. Her main argument was that Mary Sues are OMG STRONG WOMEN, and that by objecting to the horrible writing, we are preventing these girls from expressing themselves as STRONG WOMEN. She also seemed to miss a few key points regarding the definition of a Mary Sue. Given some of the horribly sexist attitudes displayed by Sues (Laburnum&#39;s Kittensquick and Warlord projects are especially noticeable), we pretty much decided she was as full of crap as the average sewage plant on that point. However, looking at the bullying accusation, we concluded two things:<br>1) That&#39;s not what the PPC is about.

            <p>Firstly, she was right about certain things-- the Anti-Sue culture <i>itself</i> is often quite sexist. And bullying, yes. And cruel. The PPC as a community does strive not to be that, but there are people who don&#39;t follow the rules-- some of whom don&#39;t even bother to introduce themselves here or follow any of the rules.<br><br>Boosette&#39;s a cool person, a friend-of-a-friend, and I have a lot of respect both for her and a <i>lot</i> of the people on her side. What she said was not <i>entirely</i> a load of crap, and it sparked a <i>very</i> necessary discussion, both here and on various Dreamwidth/LJ communities, and it made me do a lot of thinking I&#39;m glad I did. The thing about not trashing Suethors? It also applies to not trashing... people. You can disagree with her without comparing her to a sewage plant.</p>

            <p>I do not wish harm upon the badfic authors. Despite them...well...writing badfic, they&#39;re humans just like us. I&#39;ve read some of the messages on here, and I was kinda bothered by the fact that the some of the posts on here seem to wish a horrible fate upon people such as the badficcers. At least some of the ficcers seem pretty friendly, and wouldn&#39;t be too bad once you get to know them.<br><br>In short, I just don&#39;t like threatening people such as the authors like that.</p>

            <p>The story I want to work on is a fairy tale punk sort thing with Nursery Rhyme and lesser fairy tale characters in the spotlight. A sort of lesser stakes kind of story. The big fairy tales and the currently out fairy tale movies are about the people that parades are thrown for, and this story is about the characters watching the parade. There&#39;s also chess, track races, the blues, organized crime, and happily ever afters.</p>

            <p>Writer&#39;s block usually means you can&#39;t think of anything new or interesting to say.

            <p>I had this cool idea about a cyberpunk world with elements of both fantasy and science fiction (and for the past five months my mind has been filled with the details of the crystalline growth that sprouts on everything and is used as a power source). I had this very snarky roguish-thief archetype, and she had a girlfriend who was a mage trained at the Government Academy, but she left, and this was a huge deal because mages without the academy&#39;s support and supplements tend to whither and fade and go into a sort of withdrawal and eventually outright <i>die</i>, and they&#39;re trying to keep her alive but they aren&#39;t sure which of the academy&#39;s odd habits were what keeps the mages alive, so they&#39;re just guessing. And there was also this trained, very powerful soldier who&#39;d gone AWOL and the thief girl basically blackmailed him into joining up with them, and all of them were going to have to go on the run and try and find a way to live free and on their own, and just escape. (And at one point I was going to give them a couple of young children sort of dumped in their laps to protect, too.)<br><br>Sadly, there are signs that Life is going to happen in November with a vengeance, and I&#39;m going to get about a thousand words, especially if I&#39;m shooting for a goal. So I don&#39;t think I can write it this year. (Instead, I will bore people to death talking about it on message boards).</p>

            <p>Hello, agents of the PPC, I&#39;m posting here to say hello and introduce myself. I&#39;m TheLowtide (any nickname you like&#39;s fine), and I&#39;ve been a lurker on the Wiki since about July. I first heard about the PPC when I stumbled upon a link to one of Troije&#39;s missions, and after looking it up on TvTropes I read the original series and started reading a bunch of the spin-offs.<br><br>There isn&#39;t a particular genre of story that I dislike, but I will admit that I&#39;ve got a real big soft spot for femslash. I tend to root for the villain of a story more then the hero, but that only goes &#39;til he loses redeeming value as a character. Yet, whenever I play a game with a morality meter, I keep ending up as good, so I&#39;m not completely sure what my fascination with the bad guys come from.<br><br>My fandoms of choice are: Negima, Bleach, Chobits, Gravitation, When they Cry, LoTR, Harry Potter, The older Artemis Fowl books (Last one I read was The Lost Colony, got no clue if there&#39;s any after that), Dune, Narnia (Bookverse only, never got around to watching Prince Caspian), Personas 3 and 4, and my personal favorite semi-obscure series, Disgaea. I should probably stress that I really, REALLY like Disgaea. A lot. I&#39;m one of those pitiable, pretty much fanatical souls who&#39;s spent over a thousand hours on those games, and will probably continue to spend even more time on them in the future.<br><br>So, that&#39;s my introduction. If there&#39;s anything you lot want to talk about, just say something and I&#39;ll be right there. So, here&#39;s a preemptive &#39;Nice to meet&#39;cha!&#39;</p>

            <p>Welcome, new friend!  Have an authentic Chuck Norris chin hair!  Don&#39;t take it out of the titanium case, though; holding in in your bare hand will cause it to cut into your flesh.  Also, don&#39;t keep the hair on your person for extended periods of time, because it is slightly radioactive and has a tendency to attract amorous male wildcats.</p>

            <p>The trailer looks very neatly and insanely great at the same time.

            <p>I don&#39;t know if anyone remembers, but I first introduced myself on the board sometime around mid-May/early June, then promptly dropped off the face of the earth.  This was due to unforeseen circumstances (including a rather significant move that really mucked up my plans for world domination.  Drat.)  In any case, I only recently settled into the new home, meaning I&#39;ve been without internet access for about four months.<br><br>But yeah, with that said, I decided to take the opportunity to re-introduce myself to the board.<br><br>I&#39;m Tranum.  I don&#39;t write fanfiction all that much (although I do write quite a bit of original fiction), but I do know how to tell good writing from bad writing.  It&#39;s an ability I pride myself on.  I&#39;m from the general vicinity of Canada, and I spent the vast majority of my time either on the internet or reading.<br><br>...That&#39;s actually about it.  ...So yeah.</p>
