            <p>There are, of course, the ones who will run with con-crit, and genuinely make the effort to improve, and the ones who will do as Maudlin Hart says. And then there&#39;s my least favorite, the ones who take the criticism, pick it apart, and then give you back all the reasons it&#39;s not valid while completely ignoring the fact that they could be less than perfect.<br>What does one do with those, I wonder? A sporking, as well? It is a rather Suethor-ish thing to do, but some of them actually do have work that&#39;s not bad, just... could be better.</p>

            <p>I always had the impression that we don&#39;t go after &quot;not bad, just... could be better&quot;, but &quot;so bad it&#39;s horrible&quot; fic. It&#39;s definitely more fun and easier to spork a fic with a horrible blatant Sue, OOC characters, and bad spelling than it is to spork one with a slightly Sueish char and some typos.</p>

            <p>I think what I may have been getting at is, what does one do in a case like that? I&#39;ve been asked multiple times by friends in creative writing courses to look over their work, and oftentimes that&#39;s all I get back, &#39;your argument is invalid because of this and this and this&#39;. How can you help someone improve, especially someone who&#39;s asked for the assistance, when they&#39;re so... defensive?<br><br>...is there even a way?<br><br>(and wow, I&#39;ve sidetracked a little from the original discussion, whoops.)</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve been there. I think it&#39;s right in between being completely unable to accept criticism and seriously considering what other people have to say about your work. I mean, if they&#39;re constructing a lucid counter-argument, at least they are taking the time to think about what you said, even if they can&#39;t accept its validity (yet). In a best-case scenario, in time and with perspective, they&#39;ll be able to look back and understand your point, and that will help them become more receptive to criticism in the future.<br><br>Of course, there are always times when an author has to stand up and say &quot;No, I did that on purpose, thank you very much, and it&#39;s not my fault if you didn&#39;t get it.&quot; Sometimes that&#39;s true. But mostly it isn&#39;t. That&#39;s the part it&#39;s hard for writers to learn. {= )<br><br>~Neshomeh, who is now in a phase such that she gets annoyed when people DON&#39;T give concrit.</p>

            <p>Not really, at least until they have matured enough to want the help.  If all they are doing is defending against your concrit, then they didn&#39;t really want it.  I&#39;ve been there, when I was less mature.  <br><br>I don&#39;t know if you have heard of Critters or not, but they have a couple of articles on how to give crits to those writers that say they want the help, but don&#39;t respond well.

            <p>... the PPC all belongs, when you get down to it, to Jay and Acacia. It was their idea. We&#39;ve added stuff, sure, but the beginning was theirs. It wouldn&#39;t be, well, <i>right</i> to profit from it.<br><br>There&#39;s also the fact that the PPC is full of a) in-jokes and b) fandom stuff which would be illegal in published form. So a book would lose the purpose and most of the unique trappings (no one would use the Flowers, HQ, Makes-Things or Remote Activators, for sure)... it&#39;d be easier just to make something <i>not</i> based on the PPC.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Hi, I&#39;m back, and I finally have a new mission. For those expecting a plant joke, I apologize--I suffered a case of editing, and the plant joke had to go. On the other hand, if anyone would like a mini-Toruk, or a mutant wolf(good for sniffing out sues, good with children, and will nibble on everything from shoes to Sues), please feel free to contact me.<br>The author is...something that I cannot print. The story was horrible, and a sad mark on the newest fandom. Here&#39;s a link to my mission: <a href="http://agentsams.livejournal.com/1094.html"><a href="http://agentsams.livejournal.com/1094.html">http://agentsams.livejournal.com/1094.html</a></a><br>Things have been a little weird here, and hopefully the entire canon can help out the agents a little bit more. After all, who doesn&#39;t want a sentient planet helping them actively fight?<br>Honu_Wahine</p>

            <p>Basically, the best and brightest people flee earth to a planet in orbit around Alpha Centauri prime shortly before a massive nuclear war. After some misadventures involving a terrorist organization, an assassin, a damaged fusion reactor, and some other stuff, they split into seven factions and start cities on the planetary surface, at which point they come under attack by indigenous mindworms and fast growing xenofungus. It turns out the fungus is sentient and controls the mindworms and their naval, aerial, and, in the expansion, artillery and submarine variants. <br><br>Since it&#39;s a civilization style 4X game, the exact ending is up to the player, though the consequences of the conquest, diplomatic, and economic victories are somewhat unclear. Basically, the humans merge with the planetmind, get eaten by mindworms, or burn, poison, and nuke the fungus back. Alternately, in the expansion one of the alien factions calls in home fleet.</p>

            <p>I know NCIS is a small fandom overall, but it has had an invasion of a particularly obnoxious type of badfic.  I looked on the wiki to see if this has an entry, and it doesn&#39;t.  I&#39;m not sure which department this would appeal to, as most of the stories of this type are stated as being non-sexual, and most do not involve original characters.  Just the canon characters twisted nearly beyond recognition.  This has absolutely no basis, not even a thin, tenuous shred of basis, in canon.<br><br>Basically, they all revolve around very thin or non-existent plots that are there only to serve the purpose of having one of the characters, usually Gibbs, spank one of the other characters, usually either Tony or Abby.  I didn&#39;t realize that this seems to be a problem fairly specific to NCIS until I did a word search and &quot;spanking&quot; comes up 212 times for NCIS, out of 499 hits with the remaining hits spread over 70 other categories.<br><br>So is anyone interested in taking down a Suethor who focuses on non-sexual spanking of adults?  The main author of these has written 77 stories, and even started 2 series of stories just to continue inflicting this junk on the fandom.  There are two other main authors with 45 and 35 stories apiece, although some of their stories have been inflicted on other fandoms.<br><br>I&#39;m afraid that with these Suethors branching out into other fandoms that this could become as popular as mpreg.  It already has mpreg (21 hits) beat by a long shot at NCIS.<br><br>Here&#39;s an example by the most prolific of these authors.<br><br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4203431/1/Evasive_Manoeuvres"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4203431/1/Evasive_Manoeuvres">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4203431/1/Evasive_Manoeuvres</a></a><br><br>I really did try to closely read the whole thing, but the urge to spork out my eyes if I kept it up was too strong, and the self preservation instinct kicked in causing me to skim the last half.  Anybody got extra bleeprin?</p>

            <p>Oh, I am so glad that someone else hates them too!  And &quot;non sexual&quot;  - maybe for the character, but from some of the descriptions of glowing red buttocks methinks the author is getting off on it!<br><br>I think that it&#39;s a way for people with limited abilities and imagination to devise a plot for a hurt/comfort fic.  Character A does something wrong.  Character B (Gibbs) spanks them.  Hugs all round.  It&#39;s a ready made plot device: no intelligence or imagination required.  I call them &quot;Here&#39;s one I made earlier&quot;  or &quot;Just add spanking&quot;. </p>

He spends part of the story acting somewhat normal, and then the rest acting about 4 with the reactions of the other characters in line with a mental &amp; physical age of 4.  I sort of think the author forgot what age he/she wrote in the first place.  Still the stated age was physically 14, mentally the same age as in the movie.  Given the age of some of the characters in the movie, like Chekov being only 17, yet old enough to be mostly through with training, I have to conclude that 14 is old enough to be in Star Fleet, at least in some cases.  If you are old enough to be training for your career then you are old enough to be treated as and act like an adult, so, to me, other than quality of writing, this fic is the same as the NCIS one I posted.</p>

            <p>Bad Het was my first thought. I haven&#39;t read the fic itself yet, but to me consensual spanking is little if not sexual. Just because they&#39;re not actively having sex doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s not sexual. Perhaps the authors should look up the meaning of BDSM? (Again, I haven&#39;t read it yet, so I&#39;m shooting in the dark here, but even so...)<br><br>Odd that it&#39;s just NCIS, though. You&#39;d think it would be more popular.<br><br>--anamia</p>

            <p>There are pretty strong prohibitions on fraternization in the Navy, arguably stronger ones than in some of the other service branches.  These cover not only strictly sexual conduct between enlisted and officer individuals, but any overly familiar conduct that do not respect the relevant ranks, pay grades, or specific relationships and disrupt or discredit individuals.  Other relevant regulations would include <a href="http://www.29palms.usmc.mil/base/safety/eo/shpunishment.asp">a pretty decent variety of stuff</a>, starting at reduced pay for months and moving up to a bad conduct discharge and some jail time.  There are always exceptions and cases where no one reports the matter, but it&#39;s not something you&#39;d consider a safe action.<br><br>It&#39;d actually be pretty funny to list out the various parts of the UCMJ these individuals are breaking, although as I said, I&#39;m not familiar enough with the canon to say if it&#39;d be OOC enough to be a charge.<br><br>I can actually think of some nonsexual explanations, but they&#39;re honestly a little more disturbing than the sexual ones.  Spanking fetishism is at least fairly passe as compared to some of the psychological causes of most types of obsessions that involve human interaction.<br><br>Given the Flower&#39;s policy of throwing Bad Het at Bad Slashers, it seems like they&#39;d toss it at whatever department is best equipped for the matter, Bad Slash seems like the best bet.  It&#39;s certainly not something you&#39;d want the DMS handling, there&#39;d be dead canons everywhere.</p>

            <p>NCIS special agents aren&#39;t in the Navy.  They are often ex-Navy or Marines though.  Gibbs is a former Marine Sergeant.  Gibbs does not talk much, in fact in that story I linked he said more than he would normally in 3-4 full episodes.  He is intensely loyal to his team.  When they were split up, and Tony was actually sent to be an agent afloat (where he was completely miserable), Gibbs fought very hard to have him returned to the team.  So, him threatening to send Tony to be an agent afloat is very uncanon.  He also does not have the authority to do that.  He could kick Tony off his team, but not determine where he went next.  <br><br>This office where they are supposed to be doing this is a huge room divided by cubicle barriers into team groups.  It is never fully empty of agents, even at night.  It is video monitored by guards as well.  So not only would these two men have to know about this and neither say anything, but any and all agents who were present at the time, the security guards, and probably the technicians in the MTAC would all have to be keeping quiet, too.  And on the topic of agents not saying anything, where are the other two team members?  If they just finished at an outside location then McGee and Ziva should have been in the elevator with them.<br><br>Tony is overtly a bit of a class clown, but he purposefully uses that to distract others into underestimating him.  He is the primary choice for undercover missions, and spent an entire season working a special undercover mission for the Director without his team being able to catch him at it.  If he was standing facing this General he was supposed to have insulted, it would be uncanon for the insult to have come out of his mouth.<br><br>Gibbs response to some kind of screw up would be along the lines of &quot;Fix it.  Now!&quot;  or &quot;Get your head on straight, or get out.&quot;  Maybe a glare and then a walk away.  Gibbs is not the fatherly teacher type portrayed in the story.  The one time he started being kind of fatherly nice to everyone, Tony poked at him (verbally) until he started acting like himself.  That was when they had an team member shot and killed by a sniper while she was standing right next to them.  It took something like that to shake Gibbs into not acting like his normal self, but note that Tony managed to contain his reaction even in that situation.<br><br>Tony would not cry.  He does not act like a naughty 8 year old.  He also hates hospitals and pain meds, so unless something was broken he would not have agreed to go to the ER and definitely would not have taken the meds.  He came back to work either 2 or 3 weeks early after having the pneumonic plague.  He doesn&#39;t whine about serious stuff.  A paper cut-yeah he plays for sympathy.  Something serious-no.  He&#39;s actually only shown real fear and dread once in 7 seasons, and that was when they thought they were trapped on a ship with some kind of plague.  He panicked for about 2 minutes that he would catch it and had already used up his &#39;beat the plague&#39; card.  <br><br>That&#39;s just the &#39;story&#39; surrounding the actual act.  I don&#39;t even know how to begin to describe how anathema that is to those characters.  Gibbs would never do something like that and Tony would never accept it.  <br><br>A CAD pointed at these characters in this fic would probably explode.</p>

            <p>One of the author bios of the people writing this stuff between the adult canon characters of NCIS requested Star Wars fanfic of a nonscarred Darth Vader meeting and spanking Luke in the age range of 8-14.  This guy also claimed to work with small children in real life.  Now that is scary.</p>

            <p>Hiya, it&#39;s another newbie! <br><br>I found the PPC through some aimless web surfing and subsequently laughed my way through the original series and a few other missions, then found the wiki. It seemed right up my street - after all, who wouldn&#39;t love the chance to use as much violence as they like in disposing of a Sue? Mwahaha... So, I thought I&#39;d introduce myself, and maybe be able to write a mission or two of my own one day (that is, if I can whip any of the characters hiding in my brain into shape!)<br><br>I&#39;m into rather a lot of fandoms, but the ones I&#39;m most obsessed with at the moment are LotR, Doctor Who, Larklight by Philip Reeve (Not that there&#39;s much of a fandom for it or it&#39;s sequels), and the Bartimaeus Trilogy, which is pretty much made of awesome. Oh, and Redwall :D<br><br>I also like zombies rather a lot. And living history. Not usually together, but that would be interesting! You may have noticed I&#39;m a little off my trolley, but that seems to be fine here!<br><br>Well, that was a long intro. Apologies =D</p>

            <p>Well, it&#39;s difficult to say, although I do have a slight bias towards the classic horror zombies, just because  they&#39;re fun to watch shuffling around =D. When you say fantasy zombies, do you mean intelligent, human-like ones?</p>

            <p>I meant the &quot;undead minions&quot; kind of zombie made by an evil wizard, as opposed to the brain-eating kind that usually show up in modern Earth settings due to radiation, a virus, etc.  I guess it&#39;s more a difference in the mood of the story than in the zombies themselves.</p>

            <p>I see what you mean. They&#39;re always good too, but the brain-eating ones are kind of cute. In a, er...evil, undead way...hehe. But yeah, I think it does depend on the story. I wonder if there&#39;s some kind of guide for categorising zombies?</p>

            <p>Welcome to the PPC! Here&#39;s a Glitter-proof shield from the Raven Armory and a bottle of bleeprin. (The shield can&#39;t be Suefied and it serves as a useful wall if you want to block out your view of the Sue at any time. Don&#39;t ask how I got the original shield to be this way. You&#39;re best off not knowing.)<br>A Redwall fan? Well met. It&#39;s one of my favorite book series.</p>

            <p>I, anamia, do hereby officially request permission to join the PPC. I vow to uphold canon and to destroy badfic, to abhore Mary Sues and to apreciate good writing. I promise to do the Duty to the best of my ability and not be swayed by foolish prejudices. I understand that, in joining the PPC I have sworn away my sanity, social life, and future career, and do willingly give these things up. I swear to be as good an agent as I find it within my power to be, and I wish to join the ranks of those who fight tirelessly against badfic in order to make canon a safer place.<br>So I speak, so I intend,<br>--anamia<br><br><u>Agents</u><br>Agent Sarah Vym<br>Age: 22<br>Species: Human<br>Gender: female<br>Partner: Agent Elaina Thyme<br>Home Continuum: Real World<br>Department: Department of Bad Slash, Harry Potter division<br>Fandom(s): Harry Potter, Earth’s Children, Twilight (emergencies only)<br>Lust Object(s): Draco Malfoy<br>Appearance: Of medium height and more than average weight. She has brown hair reaching halfway down her back which gets unbearably bushy and puffy in times of humidity or when it’s in a bad temper and which she hates. She has brown eyes and wears glasses. Sarah’s clothes are loose-fitting, and she carries a black shoulderbag with her on missions that contains the mission essentials, as well as ibuprofen, bleeprin, her iPod, and reading material. She has also been known to carry at various times rolls of duct tape in various outlandish colors including plaid, hot pink, and, at least once wilver. Please don’t ask about that. She tends to get testy when questions about her duct tape preferences. She also always has at least one matchbox on her person, though she does not smoke and is forbidden from lighting candles inside HQ (and outside of HQ, for that matter).<br>Personality: Sarah is short tempered and has few qualms in showing this to those she knows. Around strangers she tends to be reserved and taciturn, leading to the common assumption that she is incapable of experiencing emotions. She was, at one point, dragged into FicPsych to examine this, but her feelings for her Lust Object, Draco Malfoy, made it clear that she did indeed have most of the same emotions as others. The only one she still has trouble with is regret, and the SO has kept her out of the DMS because he fears that she might kill a cannon character who pissed her off. <br>However, as though to counter this public lack of emotional exuberance, Sarah is also a self-proclaimed fangirl and has very few problems admitting this. While at first this caused problems between Sarah and her partner, they have since worked this out, and Elaina has learned to tolerate Sarah’s tendency to ramble on about how adorable Draco Malfoy looks with any number of other men and boys. Her saving grace is that her fics are generally judged to be of decent quality, and are thus left alone.<br>Sarah is a grammar nazi and will correct everyone else’s grammar obsessively, much to their annoyance. She herself speaks perfectly, and she is well aware of this. She started her career at PPC in the Department of Technical Errors, before being transferred to DBS when she threatened to kill an author due to exceedingly poor grasp of the English language. She swears often and loudly, usually by invoking the name of various deities, whether real, fictional, or of her own creation.<br><br>Agent Elaina Thyme<br>Age: 23   <br>Species: Human<br>Gender: female<br>Partner: Agent Sarah Vym<br>Home Continuum: Real World<br>Department: Department of Bad Slash, Harry Potter division<br>Fandom(s): Harry Potter, Gundam Wing, Yugioh, <br>Lust Object(s): Sirius Black, Seto Kaiba<br>Appearance: Elaina is short and curvy, with black hair which she keeps in braids and dark brown skin. Her eyes too are black. She likes to wear eccentric jewelry, which she removes on missions, and has her ears pierced several times. She carries a backpack with her on missions containing her exorcism supplies, a stiletto just in case, reading material, bleeprin and bleepka, and any gadgets she needs. She also has possession of the Remote Activator, since Sarah tends to be absent minded and forget it places, which is bad. <br>Personality: Elaina is more balanced then her partner, and presents basically the same personality to everyone she meets: confident almost to the point of being cocky, friendly, and rather snarky when she’s annoyed. She has never been dragged down to FicPsych, much to her delight, and lacks the homicidal urges that characterize many of the other PPC agents, including her partner. She carries her stiletto just in case, but has never yet had to actually use it. <br>Elaina, as the more levelheaded of the pair, is most often loaned out to other departments, usually the Department of Implausible Crossovers. She would much rather work in DBS, as she prefers exorcisms to neuralyzing, but will, of course, do what she is asked to do. After all, Elaina does want to keep her job. She was rather traumatized when her previous Partner, Agent Daphne Flamewright defected from PPC to stay in a Harry Potter fic and become Lucius Malfoy’s sex toy. Daphne was later removed by force from the fic and sent to be an inpatient at FicPsych, but Elaina is still fairly scarred by the whole thing, and is mistrustful of any new partner. She and Sarah clashed originally, but have since learned to get along and even respect each others’ skills. <br>Elaina has an obsession with blood, especially her own, and the extend of this fascination can scare even her. Her method of coping with badfic is to bite into herself until she bleeds, a habit which disgusts and disturbs her partner. Elaina is starting to get concerned about this, but has decided that, really, it’s no worse than the obsession some of her fellow agents have with bleeprin-derived products and probably healthier as well. She’s also a  masochist, actually preferring the more disgusting, appalling fics. Sarah is of the opinion that she is utterly, completely insane, and Elaina has to agree. Still, it does not seem to have hurt her too much thus far.<br><br><u>Writing sample</u><br><a href="http://anamiascorner.webs.com/miscwritings.htm">Justification</a></p>

            <p><i>Justification</i> is a heck of a meaningful work, and things like it are often of publishable quality. A few typos, and some stylistic things :<br><ul>
<li>&quot;but the she turned a corner and vanished from my view and I thought no more of it.&quot; should probably be &quot;but then she&quot;.</li>
<li>&quot;as though she were running, not from a person but from her own thoughts.&quot; probably could use a comma between &quot;person&quot; and &quot;but&quot;.  &quot;But&quot; isn&#39;t separating two independent clauses, but it is being used to show contrast, and &quot;not from a person&quot;.</li>
<li>&quot;It was hard blow, I will admit, yet one which I too with an ease which surprised even me&quot; should probably be &quot;I took&quot;.</li>
<li>&quot;I had the image of her forever engrained&quot; scans... artificially.  That may be the goal, since it&#39;s probably not something the viewpoint character is proud to say, but if not I&#39;d recommend &quot;her image&quot; instead of &quot;image of her&quot;.  &quot;Engrained&quot; is an archaic form of colouring.  You probably want &quot;ingrained&quot;, to have deeply impress into a surface.</li>
<li>&quot;I looked back at my professor only once during that ceremony, and that to shake his hand properly.&quot; is technically correct if the last &quot;that&quot; refers to the time the viewpoint character looked back, but it&#39;s not clear and may be read as a &#39;dummy subject&#39;.  &quot;Then&quot; is typically used when you want to refer to a time period.  If you intend for it to sound archaic, though, &quot;that&quot; is preferred.</li>
<li>&quot;at the Royal library.&quot; may be better as &quot;The Royal Library&quot; or &quot;the Royal Library&quot;.  While you&#39;re not citing a specific library, it&#39;s probably best to err on the side of proper nouns here with how many Royal Libraries are treated as such in the Real World.</li>
<li>&quot;Or perhaps I am reading too much into the situation and I was the only one affected by her absence.&quot; is probably complex enough that it could take a comma between &quot;situation&quot; and &quot;and&quot;.  It&#39;s borderline, so try both and see what you prefer</li>
<li>&quot;when I could not avoid thinking, and I would always reply with a jest or a grin, not truly present.&quot; seems like &quot;not truly present&quot; is modifying an early part of the sentence.  That may be the goal, if you want his thoughts as a whole to be somewhere else.  If you want to focus more on the jest or grin not being there but the mind being present, it may be preferable to pull out the comma after &quot;grin&quot;.</li>
<li>&quot;I began a respected Professor in my own right&quot; may simply be an archaic use I&#39;m not familiar with, but it&#39;s jarring to modern eyes.  Either switching from &quot;began&quot; to &quot;became&quot; or (less likely) &quot;Professor&quot; to &quot;professorship&quot; would flow much better.</li>
<li>&quot;, and is tainted by something I could not quite name, &quot; is technically incorrect for having the wrong tense -- &quot;is&quot; should probably be something like &quot;it was&quot; or &quot;was&quot;.  You may want this to attract the eye, but it&#39;s a dangerous tool.</li>
<li>&quot;still not pulling her hand out of mind.&quot; would hopefully be &quot;mine&quot;.</li>
<li>&quot;long.”Gently, she tried&quot; needs a space or two between &quot;long.&quot; and &quot;Gently&quot;.</li>
<li>&quot;bear to spent my remaining&quot; should probably be &quot;spend&quot;.</li>
<li>&quot;some happily and other less so&quot; should probably be &quot;others&quot;.</li>
<li>There&#39;s a few of pronouns with unknown antecedents.  You can almost always get away with such generic pronouns when they function as a &#39;dummy subject&#39;, but such an option is best reserved for when the pronoun can refer to everyone, or when who it refers to can not be identified.  The most significant case of this would be &quot;Only recently had they allowed&quot; -- presumably referring to a generic they that watched the viewpoint character -- but &quot;I did not see her on that first trip out&quot; likewise relies on the knowledge that &quot;the child&quot; is female.  We&#39;ve not be given that yet, and even with that information the phrase arguably ends up feeling like it should point to the nurse anyway.  Native English speakers generally won&#39;t have a problem with this matters, but it&#39;s best to read them aloud and compare them to alternative phrasings to see if a clearer version does not distract from the tone.  This is a case-by-case thing, though.</li>
<li>A few words -- dresses, nursery, and murmured would be the ones I noticed the most -- are repeated a few times in a short period, and then dropped from the writing.  This may have been intentional and I&#39;m missing the purpose, but there are alternative words that could be used without erring on the side of urple, or more distributed uses may reduce the issue.</li>

            <p>I really enjoyed your writing sample. I was hooked from the first paragraph, which doesn&#39;t happen very often. I wanted to find out what was going on... but then, the entire point was that some things have and need no explanation.

            <p>Hello.  I just found the PPC through an Indemaat story (&quot;NSIS&quot;) on FFnet.  I read it thinking, &quot;It&#39;s about time somebody took on these terrible stories!&quot; Then I followed back to her website and finally to the wiki.  This is a great idea.  <br><br>I&#39;ve never actually put pen to paper for fanfic, as I have always recognized that most of my fanfic ideas are not something I&#39;d want to publish. I&#39;m not a shipper, just not very good at making an episode-like story that I feel meets standards.<br><br>I do write original fic, so if I ever get the nerve up to request permission for an agent, then I&#39;ll have something to point to.<br><br>I like to read episode-like stories, episode tag stories, and good character pieces.  I have read AU and slash that I liked, but not much.  My favorite characters are pretty solidly het in canon, so it always involves a lot of OOC, usually by making one or sometimes both of the characters a whiny little *word meaning female dog*.  I have seen it done well, though.<br><br>I don&#39;t much care for shipper stories, I have seen a few well written, but most of them are vastly OOC, usually in the same way as above for the guys.<br><br>I read a lot of NCIS, Stargate SG-1, and Stargate Atlantis.  I have not seen the last season of Stargate SG-1 yet, though I&#39;m working my way up to it on Netflix.  My favorite characters to read about are Rodney and Shepherd (not shippy) from Atlantis.  Tony only or with Gibbs (not shippy) from NCIS, and Daniel from Stargate SG-1.  I love to read fics focused on Jonas from SG-1 too, but goodfics including Jonas in a meaningful way are one of the rarest things in fanfic, I believe.  These are not really lust objects, more just my favorites to focus on and/or torture.  (torture of these characters not being entirely unheard of or even really that exceptional in canon)<br><br>I have been known to read X-Men in the comic verse, mostly because I had a teenage crush on Gambit in the cartoon.  Yes, I was weird.  I&#39;ve read very little of the actual comics.  I have checked out the official site for summaries of the plots, so I have some idea of what is canon, but not enough to ever think about PPCing one of them.  And there a lot that really, really deserve PPCing.<br><br>I watch Bones and House.  But I don&#39;t read their fanfic, because House and Bones are rare and specialized geniuses, and I figure that very few fanficers have the intelligence/knowledge to write an episode-like story in that world.  I also love Firefly (hated Serenity), but gave up on the fanfiction a long time ago.  I like Star Trek-the original, Next Generation, and DS 9.  I have also read the larger and less annoying of the novels such as Spock&#39;s World.<br><br>I am a big fan of Tolkien and certain Star Wars books.  Anne McCaffrey is my favorite author.  I especially like Pern and Petaybee.  Actually, I like all of her stuff I have read, and I have read approximately 80% of the total, which is impressive when you consider she has written more than 100 books.  I have never gotten into fanfiction for Pern though.<br><br>I have read and liked Harry Potter, Artemis Fowl, and the Warriors.  Percy Jackson is next on my list after I finish up with Warriors.<br><br>When I first heard of fanfic as a large presence on the internet, I fell into some really, really badfic from Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings.  I have really never been back to their sites.  I don&#39;t know if this is or was very common, but the stories I ended up with had Faramir (my favorite character from the books) as a terrible weakling/victim, modern terminology/concepts spouting out of Hobbit mouths, and/or Legolas was, uh, far from noble, etc.  Harry and Snape are in love (like in a sexual relationship regardless of the fact that Harry was supposed to have been 12-13 at the time.

            <p>*poke*<br><br>May I ask what you found to hate about Serenity? I mean, I know it&#39;s not what anyone had in mind for the end of the show, but I though it did its job pretty well.<br><br>Another McCaffrey fan, eh? Cool. I think I&#39;ve read about 90-95% of her work, myself. My favorites are Pern and the Freedom series, followed by Petaybee (though not the newest ones about the kids, which I haven&#39;t read) and the Talents series, especially the earlier books. I really don&#39;t like Acorna. It was all right at first, but the series went downhill after McCaffrey switched co-authors. Acorna turned into a huge canon Sue. Also not a huge fan of the Crystal Singer series. Way, WAY too much time spent on the booze sub-plot.<br><br>What are your feelings about Todd&#39;s work? I liked Dragon&#39;s Kin, but I thought Dragonsblood sucked awfully, and I haven&#39;t gotten up the courage to try the other ones.<br><br>I believe I have the only Pernese agent in the PPC, so I will take this opportunity to shamelessly plug the stories in which he appears:<br><br><a href="http://starshadowhall.tripod.com/ppc/dic/03hpdrop.html">DIC RC #999, Mission 3: Harry Potter and the Dragonriders of Pern</a>, in which he is recruited.<br><br><a href="http://starshadowhall.tripod.com/ppc/ficpsych/casefile02.html">FicPsych: Gestalt Therapy</a>, in which lots of important things happen, many of which include him.<br><br>Coming soon is his first actual mission as an agent, which will appear at <a href="http://starshadowhall.tripod.com/ppc/rc1110.html">DMS RC #1110</a> as soon as it&#39;s out of beta. That&#39;s also where you&#39;ll find his profile (which is also on the Wiki).<br><br>If you&#39;re interested in good Pern fic, I&#39;d recommend <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/u/987234/astrokath">Astrokath</a>&#39;s work. I don&#39;t blame you for being cautious, though. There is an awful lot of tripe in the fandom. {= P<br><br>I also agree that it&#39;s pretty much impossible to write decent House episode!fic unless you actually have some kind of degree in medicine. I consider myself fairly well educated about that sort of thing--always got As in Bio, Anatomy &amp; Physiology, and even Epidemiology--but even knowing the liberties taken by the show, I still wouldn&#39;t attempt it. ... I tried role-playing as House once, and even though it was a crack crossover RP, I was still biting my nails and feeling woefully under-prepared despite doing research the whole time. {= P So, yeah.<br><br>Anyway!

            <p>I just felt too rushed with Serenity.  Like I was playing catch up the whole film.  It was disorienting how the characters had all split up, and so much time had happened since the last episode of Firefly.  Maybe I would have liked the movie better if I hadn&#39;t been such a fan of Firefly.  I came into Firefly when they started showing it on SciFi.  I thought it was a new show, because I&#39;d never heard of it before.  Then I found out that it had been canceled a long time before.  That sucked.<br><br>I haven&#39;t read the Freedom or Crystal Singer series yet.  I have read almost all of the Acorna books-I think I am missing the last 1 or 2-and I thought they were okay, but yeah, I can see thee canon Sue label applying.  I have just finished getting caught up on the Talent series lately, and I&#39;ve enjoyed it.  I have only read Dragon&#39;s Kin of his (I think that is the title I read, about the watch whers, right?)<br><br>I read all the stuff about Derik.  Sounds like he&#39;ll be a good agent to read.</p>

            <p>I can see how it would be disappointing if you came into the fandom not knowing it was over before it started, sorta. I got into it because everyone I knew at the time had been telling me how awesome Firefly was and how much it sucked that it was canceled. Also, I&#39;d already been through a similar experience with Farscape&#39;s cancellation and subsequent miniseries, so I knew what to expect from Serenity with regards to the rushing to tie things up. At least they got a chance to do it at all, though.<br><br>Yeah, Dragon&#39;s Kin is the one about the watch-whers. I thought it was cool that they got some development. Dragonsblood, on the other hand, is about a dragon plague and is full of dubious science (does Todd know ANYTHING about genetics?) and a bizarre time-transcending plot device that reminded me of Redwall and really, really didn&#39;t seem to fit with Pern. At all. {= P<br><br>The Freedom series is good, though. It&#39;s got survival situations, necessity being the mother of invention, a cool anti-hero, redemption and other human(oid) drama, humans kicking alien butt against the odds, and, because it&#39;s McCaffrey, sex (in which size DOES matter) and booze. It&#39;s a good ride. {= )<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

It has a very fantasy feel to it, because it is set on a planet that is pre-steam, though barely.  The thing that made me like it the most is that one of the originals is a whiny teenage prince who thinks he is the center of the world, because he is speshul.  And he has to deal with a very in character Rodney McKay!  <br><br>Seriously though, this is the best written fanfic I have ever read.  I even opened an ffnet account just to give it a signed review.  It is over 100k.  At the time I had just finished reading I made note that I had noticed 6-7 typos of the spellcheck misses these type, such as &quot;to&quot; for &quot;so&quot;, and that there were a couple of places that it had taken me up to a paragraph to figure out which viewpoint character had the viewpoint after a scene change.<br><br>This is well worth the time it takes to read.</p>

            <p>My favorites are the X-Wing series.  My all time favorite quote comes from them.  <br><br>&quot;Pretty,&quot; Donos said.  &quot;What do we blow up first?&quot; Star Wars X-Wing: Solo Command, Aaron Allston.<br><br>I also have read the novels of the original movies, the books that come between them and just after episode 6, a couple of the ones in chronological order after Truce at Bakura, and the x wing series.  I prefer the Allston/Wraith books to the Stackpole/Rogue books.  I also read both Han Solo trilogies and the Corellian trilogy.  The first trilogy isn&#39;t worth much, but the second is a truly worthy book.  I keep aiming to read more of them to further the story, but have never gotten around to it. </p>

            <p>. . . Just came up in my mission. Okay, so I&#39;ve sort-of halfway completed my first mission(second, but first punishment), and one of the Na&#39;Vi canons did something interesting while I was charging the sue. He&#39;d connected to a Tree of Voices just minutes before I neuralyzed the cast to make them forget plant!Sue(there&#39;s a story there, I promise), and I was wondering... Do I have to neuralyze  the entire freaking planet now, or can I just have the entire damn thing, along with, Hades forbid, Eywa, be aware of the PPC? That&#39;d be interesting. . .<br>The cackling nutcase a.k.a. Honu_Wahine</p>

            <p>Since I can&#39;t figure out any way to neuralyze the whole of Pandora(even if you neuralized every lifeform on it, Eywa herself lacks eyes.): I&#39;d recommend that you&#39;d simply take advantage of the situation and do the unthinkable: Tell Eywa the truth. Tell them of the Suvian threat, and why you had to kill that beautiful, perfect, sweet, defenseless little Mary-Sue. Since you&#39;d have to have them aware of the PPC, you&#39;d better take advantage of it.<br><br>And if you did decide to neuralize Pandora somehow, I&#39;d recommend starting with an orbital platform with a really big neuralyzer taped to it, hanging directly above the nightside of Pandora. Keep orbiting in synch with the nightside, and neuralize the whole of the planet over a 24-hour period.</p>

            <p>First, a planet-wide exorcism has been done before (twice, I think), though I don&#39;t know about a neuralization. I suppose it would be possible, but you may need some help. <br><br>Second, there is the fact that in general, the canon environment protects agents because it knows that they are here to help. You could extend that to Eywa, as sort-of-a-character who the PPC wouldn&#39;t mind having on their side. I would suggest having Eywa&#39;s awareness be part of the effect of canon protecting the agents.<br><br></p>

            <p>*facepalm*  Of course there is.  <br><br>Aren&#39;t there some canon characters that know about Mary Sues and PPC?

            <p>Ooh...I don&#39;t know.<br><br>How would you even go about neuralyzing the thing? You can&#39;t exorcise it, because it doesn&#39;t sound like he was under the influence of a posession sue. Maybe if you connected somebody to the Big Ol&#39; Treebrain through their convenient neural hair-tentacle, and then neuralized it... no. You&#39;d have to neuralize every eye-posesssing lifeform on the planet, and... no, <i>that</i> wouldn&#39;t work, because Eywa clearly stores data in her neural network...<br><br>The difficulties and/or impossibilities of neuralyzing the planet may make it unavoidable to have the entire planet aware of the PPC. But equally, having an entire canon aware of the PPC would (probably) be <i>really bad</i>. (but admittedly interesting.) Either way, the Sunflower is going to administer serious pain in a you-ward direction.<br><br>Nice to see somebody else who saw Avatar.</p>
