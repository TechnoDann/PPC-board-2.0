            <p>I always like the premise of the movie Back to the future... as well as everything. else about it.  But the idea of being forced back in time and, in addition to trying to find a way back home, to have to help your parents get together to save your future hide always appealed to my inner &#39;shipper.<br><br>So... I just got the first chapter of a new fanfic up.  It&#39;s been forming in my head for years but other projects (including ones that are going or went nowhere) distracted me from it.  It&#39;s basically set in a possible future of the underGRADS canon, where one of the kids gets sent back in time by a government/university experiment gone wonk... and, as well as trying to get back (and getting their own parents together), decides that they have to be the ones who get together the parents of two of her best friends and try not to reveal too much to her only confidant... her future godmother.  Because (it is written that) to know the future is to be trapped by it... but to know that there IS a trap is the first step in evading it.<br><br>And this kid likes being trapped.<br><br>Of course, it may also be a very detailed dream.<br><br>For a link to the prologue/first chapter:<br><br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5856773/1/Click_Tock"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5856773/1/Click_Tock">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5856773/1/Click_Tock</a></a></p>

            <p>Does it matter where your written works are kept? I keep seeing livejournal over and over again, but I already have my own site. Could I just use that instead? Wiki doesn&#39;t specify (as far as I can tell).<br><br>Also, if you can maintain good storytelling, is it necessary to disguise your characters every time they go after a fic?<br><br>For example, if I had a ninja, would s/he have to be disguised, even if nobody (that is a canon character) ever saw them?

            <p>Well, I&#39;ve never seen one myself, so I guess i can&#39;t prove or disprove that.<br><br>But ninjas use disguises as often as creeping along in shadows (if not more often) to hide, so there&#39;s no reason <em>not</em> to put on a disguise, even if you plan on not being seen. </p>

            <p>From the <a href="http://www.freewebs.com/ppc_manual/Volume04.htm#ii">PPC Manual, Volume 4, Chapter 2</a>, emphasis added:<br><br>&quot;The reason for the Disguise Generator is simple. <i>It is against PPC policy to interfere with the Canon worlds more than necessary</i> -- to do so would only cause more work for us. Thus, Agents disguise themselves as races from the Canon -- as elves, orcs, generic human wizards, and so forth. If possible, it is recommended that the disguise chosen is of <i>something that would reasonably perform the actions the Agent is undertaking</i> -- for example, killing a member of the Fellowship of the Ring -- but it is appreciated that this is not always viable, and violations of this rule are usually overlooked.&quot;<br><br>That is the original reason for disguises, and why Jay and Acacia usually went as orcs. So, unless you plan to stick exclusively to continua full of humans from your character&#39;s era/style of dress, the answer is <i>yes</i>, even a ninja has to go in disguise, even if it&#39;s just clothes.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I think that Agents in bad slash don&#39;t use disguises much, because they usually only have canon characters to dealt with.  The canon characters won&#39;t see or hear an Agent unless the Agent does something really loud/noticeable.  The Somebody Else&#39;s Problem field generator in the flash patch keeps them from noticing the Agents.  However, the Agents <i>are</i> a Mary Sue&#39;s problem, so the Sues can see and hear the Agents.  The disguises keep the Sues from recognizing the Agents for what they really are.<br><br>At least that is my understanding of it.<br><br><a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Flashpatch"><a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Flashpatch">http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Flashpatch</a></a><br><br><a href="http://starshadowhall.tripod.com/ppc/gizmo.html"><a href="http://starshadowhall.tripod.com/ppc/gizmo.html">http://starshadowhall.tripod.com/ppc/gizmo.html</a></a>  This is a handy list of PPC technology.<br><br><br><br>From the Mission Writing Guide.  <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Mission_Writing_Guide"><a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Mission_Writing_Guide">http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Mission_Writing_Guide</a></a> <br><br>&quot;Other Common Mission-Related Questions<br><br>Where should I post my completed missions?<br><br>It’s up to you.

            <p>I think the disguises are just to make things easier. I mean, as far as I can tell, it keeps them from having to neuralyze anyone that happened to see them. In one of the TOS, Agents Sean and Lux tagged along, undisguised. This would lead me to assume it is possible. But, as you of all people know, I&#39;ve been here for a shorter time than you. Thankfully, I tend to absorb information like mad (whether that is healthy or not). Anyway, my two cents are in.<br><br>P.S. Just came across info stating that most missions end with neuralyzations anyway at this point, due to the massive twisting of the canon. That would lead me to assume that the disguises are more to make things easier than anything else.</p>

            <p>&quot;[He] is white and British (when he isn&#39;t gray and furry)&quot; is probably one of the best lines I have heard.

            <p>... but I really doubt that dyslexia has any effect on your ability to properly punctuate and capitalize letters, nor affect your ability to type out certain words (specifically &#39;and&#39;) rather than substitute symbols or smaller mispelled words.<br><br>Dyslexia will not make it so that you misspell &quot;because&quot; as &quot;cos.&quot;</p>

            <p>Hey, now those who&#39;ve read my introduction thread will know that one of the reasons I came on here was to become an agent and rid the Multiverse of Mary Sues and their male counterparts, the Gary Stus. So, here are a few questions: <br><br>First of all, when you&#39;ve be a Boarder on here for a month, How do you apply to become an Agent, thus allowing you to send in reports of your battles with Mary Sues? <br><br>Number 2: I know that you&#39;ve all been recently talking about dangerous species that are allowed to be agents. So, what, in your opinion, do you think makes a good agent? Strengths? Weaknesses? Fashion? Uniform? Humour me, if you can. <br><br>Number 3: I know we have a couple of resident assassins, so, how long must you be an agent for before you can potentially become an assassin? Do you even need to be an assasin to start with?<br><br>Thank you all, and please answer!</p>

            <p>I&#39;m... not sure you quite have the idea, to be honest. We are not agents. We are Boarders. We write stories about agents, who are fictional members of a fictional organization. That in mind, I&#39;ll try to answer your questions.<br><br>1. To write PPC stories, you need Official Permission, which is explained in the wiki article <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Permission">Permission</a>. You should read it in full.<br><br>2. Good agents are interesting to read about, no matter what their species or how they dress. The ones I&#39;ve enjoyed reading about the most are the ones who have especially distinct personalities. Just a few examples include Jay and Acacia (of course); Trojie and Pads; Suicide, Diocletian, and Ithalond; and Dafydd &amp; friends. Characterization is properly the subject of an essay-length discussion, which I&#39;m not prepared to get into here, but I hope that helps.<br><br>3. If you want to kill Mary-Sues, you join the DMS, whose agents are known as Assassins. That&#39;s pretty much it.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

This story is the reason I can&#39;t bring myself to condemn any genre out of hand. I don&#39;t even like the main pairing and it&#39;s still my favorite story. So I thought I&#39;d share it. I especially love the way it deals with rival love interests, and the way the backstories don&#39;t seem contrived or ridiculous, nor do the characters whine about them. And there are some real underlying themes that carry it all, I&#39;d say.<br><br>So, your opinions?</p>

            <p>I&#39;m not usually into yaoi, but this is still just a really really well written story (and hilarious!).<br><br>I do have some questions about how this is categorized though, considering it&#39;s not really Kingdom Hearts canon at all - they just took some of the characters. The reason to use these characters to using OC characters instead seems to rely almost totally on just having a good visual picture of what they look like.  And I guess just think more about them if you really like the characters. </p>

            <p>For me, the wiki used to be black/red (though not as much as it was after the Sues), but it is now the white/blue default skin. I am using the &quot;Let the admins override my skin choice&quot; option (wouldn&#39;t it be nice if that could be different on each wiki?) and see other sites differently, so it should not be a problem on my end. Can someone fix this?</p>

            <p>Thanks for everything! I really like the scarf, it reminds me of one that a friend has in RL (well, except for the seventeen foot long part.)<br><br>I&#39;ve started writing my agent intro for when I get permission, and I have a few questions. There&#39;s an Agent Tristan on the list of response centers, but he doesn&#39;t have a page, and I can&#39;t find him anywhere else. Is it alright if I name an agent Tristan? And would singing Taylor Swift&#39;s &#39;You Belong with Me&#39; in HQ get me shot at? If not, what would? Would Nickleback be alright to sing?</p>

            <p>I&#39;ll probably be doing mostly X-men movieverse, and some Harry Potter. I&#39;m not familiar enough with Middle-earth to do missions in it, though I have read the books. Any other missions I do will probably be from various novels, like  Mercedes Lackeys Valdemar series, which I am fairly fammiliar with. I&#39;ve recently been reading Patricia Briggs&#39; Mercy Thompson and Alpha &amp; Omega novels, so I may do missions there too. As you may have guessed, my agents will be floaters.</p>

            <p>Hi there.

Fan of The Burning Dumpster (run by a friend of my brother&#39;s, actually) and PPC in particular.

            <p>*poke*<br><br>I don&#39;t know what you&#39;ve already read, of course, but there are a few things you should definitely make time for. First, there is the <a href="http://www.misssandman.com/PPC/story.html">Original PPC Series</a> by Jay and Acacia. It is our canon and that which started it all.<br><br>Second, we require that everyone read and abide by the <a href="http://twistedskein.webs.com/PPCHome/Constitution.htm">Board Constitution</a>, because it&#39;s nicer that way.<br><br>After that, there are several helpful documents on the Wiki designed to help acquaint newcomers with us and our habits and behaviors and general weirdness. Sedri&#39;s <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Guide_to_the_PPC">Guide to the PPC</a> is particularly informative, especially when combined with the <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/FAQ:_For_Newbies">FAQ for Newbies</a> and the <a href="04a.html">Mission Writing Guide</a>. If you do want to write PPC missions, you should also see the article about how to get <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Mission_Writing_Guide">Official Permission</a>.<br><br>And that&#39;s probably quite enough to start with. {= ) Welcome! Have a bumper-sticker! *sticks one on you* ^__^<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Yay! Sharp and pointy. ^_^<br><br>As for fandoms, I read mostly HP (favorite pairings/triplings in goodfic are Drarry, HG/SS, Remus/Hermione, the entire Golden Trio, Fred/Hermione/George (only in a few fics, and the twins weren&#39;t together -- they were just both dating Hermione), pretty much anything with Hermione, period). I love reading badfi...il my brain explodes. <br><br>Goodficwise, I read lots of Good Omens, too. Crowley/Aziraphale for forever. <br><br>I also enjoy reading badfics from The Matrix (or ones that crossover The Matrix and Legend of Zelda NO I AM NOT EVEN KIDDING), bad PBEM-RPG profiles, Final Fantasy, LotR....<br><br>I&#39;ll pretty much read anything sent my way if I know enough about the world it&#39;s set in to understand what&#39;s going on.

            <p>Permission is actually about permission to <i>write</i> a mission, not so much about posting. Indeed, you should have waited before writing anything at all, but you didn&#39;t know, and people make mistakes, so don&#39;t worry - we won&#39;t hang you for it.<br><br>However, you can claim badfics before getting Permission, so you are welcome to mark it as such on the Wiki, but treat your mission as if it isn&#39;t yet written until you have Permission. You could use it as your writing sample if you like.<br><br>Also, as I haven&#39;t had a chance to say hello to you yet - Hello! Welcome to the Board. I&#39;m Sedri, a relative oldbie.

            <p>Lo, I have mastered the ways of customizing the Monaco theme, so now we can make the wiki look however we want! What do you think?

            <p>I am spending the day, as I periodically do, mucking around trying to reduce our number of Wanted Pages.<br><br>A lot of these wanted pages are one-use references to Agents whom, insofar as I can see, have never had any missions or places in other writings either.<br><br>With that in mind, I am going through all the one-link-only wanted pages and unlinking all the ones that are Agent names. If you are a writer of an Agent like this, please, only make a link if you&#39;re going to make a page, and make a page SOON, rather than &#39;oh, I&#39;ll get round to that when I&#39;ve written something about them&#39;.<br><br>If you have information on an Agent character that I&#39;ve de-linked, feel free to relink and create the page. In fact, PLEASE do that. However if I&#39;ve delinked one of your Agents, please THINK before relinking. Or rather, please don&#39;t relink unless you make the page right there and then.<br><br>(Please note, the Wanted Pages list does not update itself as soon as links have been removed, only when pages are made, so it will take a few days for my changes to show up on that list)<br><br>It&#39;s about time we had another drive on closing the gap on that Wanted Pages list anyway! Come on guys, if everyone makes a page from the Wanted List, we can cut it down some more. We&#39;re at just over 200 wanted - a couple of days of people making pages and we could get it way down :D<br><br>- Trojie</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve been inspired by March Madness to go back through and finish the other mission I&#39;ve had in progress for the last four or so years.<br><br>Problem is, the fic in question is 10,000 words long and pretty awful (the Mouth of Sauron, a dragon, vampire cannibal elves, multiple Stus, a Maia Vampire Sue, Radagast as a grizzly bear and his pet lynx, oh my!). <br><br>Half the mission is four years old, and most of the rest has been written very late at night, and so I&#39;d appreciate if someone could have a look over it and check for stylistic cohesion between the new and old sections. Plus, I always seem to get quotation rules muddled up.<br><br>Any takers? I&#39;d be happy to beta read in return.<br><br>Elcalion, inspired</p>

            <p>I bet lots of you have no idea what I&#39;m talking about. Well, you&#39;re going to learn something today!<br><br>You see, here at the PPC we enjoy a concept known as &quot;fun,&quot; and one way to have fun is by playing games. Fill the Plothole is game in which someone (this time it&#39;s me) posts a selection of lulzy summaries from fanfiction.net. Then someone else (you) chooses one of these summaries to use as the inspiration for a ficlet that makes sense of the information (if you can call it that) in the summary--you fill the plothole. These ficlets can be long or short, funny or serious. They can include PPC characters or not. It&#39;s entirely up to you and your muse, so be creative!<br><br><b>Yes</b>, you may fill the plothole for a summary that someone else has already used.<br><br><b>Yes</b>, you may fill more than one plothole.<br><br><b>No</b>, it may not be rated higher than PG-13/Teen.<br><br><b>No</b>, you do not need Permission to play this game.<br><br>When posting your reply, it is helpful to include the title of the summary whose plotholes you&#39;re filling in the subject line of your post so that the readers know what they&#39;re getting into. It is also helpful to include the full summary at the beginning of your post.<br><br>If you want some examples from previous games, you want Gundamkiwi&#39;s <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/ppc_plotholes/">FtP LiveJournal</a>. Sadly, she no longer updates it, but it&#39;s still fun to visit.<br><br>And now, the plotholes gathered by me and Barid, sorted by fandom:<br><br><u>Harry Potter</u><br><br>1. <b>50 Reasons</b> by fearblank<br>50 reasons to &#39;do it&#39; starring Lily and Draco.<br><br>2. <b>Looking for a Story</b> by Confused Interests<br>Im Looking for a story about Severus and Harry that I believe is a bonding fic, but I&#39;m not quite sure. Could you please help?<br><br>3. <b>Bad Grade</b> by Sugarplumjellygum<br>Hermione goes to Snape&#39;s office to get him to change her Bad Grade and leaves with something worse.<br><br><u>Lord of the Rings</u><br><br>4. <b>Alliterative Absurdity</b> by Lysanor<br>A strangly pathetic attempt at overusing alliteration...<br><br>5. <b>Myth of Turuva Lone</b> by sagaluthien<br>For years Elladan has have his eyes on the fair blond Mirkwoodelf. Now Legolas is visiting Imaldris and Elladan take his chance, espacially as Legolas give a way an enchanted mystery.

            <p>((Note: the non-Middle Earth swearing and the Grelvish name in this piece are both intentional, because I had hoped this would be funny...))<br><br>&quot;You have some explaining to do.&quot;<br><br>To say that Legolas was angry was probably the understatement of the Age.  &#39;Perfectly livid,&#39; was probably a bit more accurate, and &#39;murderous,&#39; even more so.  However, in order to do complete justice to the Wood Elf&#39;s rage, Elrohir suspected he would have to remembered the Ancient Quenya lessons that his grandmother had hammered into his head centuries before, and he couldn&#39;t even do that in a good moment.<br><br>And, given the fact that the best reply he could come up with was a startled blink and an incoherent gurgle, this was most decidedly *not* a good moment.  Though, to his defense, the gurgle was due to the fact that Legolas currently had him pressed up against one outer wall of the last Homely House, with one slender hand throttling his windpipe.<br><br>After a moment of choking, Elrohir managed a strained &quot;Dunno...what...talkin&#39; &#39;bout.&quot;<br><br>Legolas bared his teeth in a sick parody of a smile, and released Elrohir&#39;s throat.  Elrohir fell into a sitting position on the ground, gasping for air and rubbing at his neck.<br><br>&quot;Of *course* you don&#39;t know what I&#39;m talking about,&quot; Thranduilion continued calmly, a slight twitch of his left eyelid being (temporarily) the only visible sign of his outrage.  &quot;The young groom who batted his eyes at you?  Who agreed to a midnight tryst in the garden with you two months ago?  Any of this sound familiar?&quot;<br><br>Actually, none of it did.  Elrohir had no memory of encountering flirtatious young grooms, and even if he had, he would have turned down any advances.  In fact, just before Legolas&#39;s sudden interruption, he had been composing a love-letter to a lovely Galadrim maiden, whom he had met on a long-ago trip to Grandma&#39;s and whom he intended to propose to on the next trip to Grandma&#39;s.  But, bruised as his throat was, he didn&#39;t get a chance to explain that situation before Legolas hauled him to his feet again, gripping his shirt by the lapel and shaking him senseless.<br><br>&quot;That &#39;groom&#39; is my little sister, you idiot!&quot; shouted the Prince of Mirkwood, all calm completely renounced.<br><br>Elrohir&#39;s face contorted in confusion.  &quot;Sister?  You have a sister?&quot;  It was the first time *he* had heard of it...<br><br>&quot;Yes!  A stupid, hormonal little sister who decided to be rebellious and run away from home disguised as my groom!&quot;<br><br>The pieces were starting to come together.  &quot;Blonde, fair-skinned, only about twenty-six years old, and introduces herself as Mirkwoodelf?&quot;<br><br>&quot;YES!  That&#39;s Tinawiel, trying to be Eowyn without knowing Rohirric.&quot;  Legolas paused a little, his hands shaking violently, before continuing.  &quot;And now, not only is she pregnant with your child, she&#39;s FADING, you INCONSIDERATE JACKASS!&quot;<br><br>A strangled gulp came from the dark-haired Elf.  &quot;But...I didn&#39;t...it was...&quot;<br><br>&quot;And YOU are going to MARRY her, RIGHT NOW, before she DIES, or SO HELP ME, I will DRAG YOUR BACKSIDE OVER TO MIRKWOOD AND FEED YOU TO THE SPIDERS!&quot;<br><br>The first thing that popped into Elrohir&#39;s mind at this pronouncement was a Sindarin variant of &quot;oh crap.&quot;<br><br>The second thing was &quot;DAMN YOU, ELLADAN!&quot;</p>

            <p>Invasive, that&#39;s what it was.<br><br>Hermione stared up at the ceiling, and her thoughts drifted.

Proper research, and proper procedures, and no more of this damned internal scaffolding. Barbaric, it was.

            <p>Deorwine rubbed his face and tried to think of something that alliterated with “Lady.”  The Rohirrim were having a feast tonight—the harp would be passed around, and everyone would recite poetry in turn.

            <p><i>1. 50 Reasons by fearblank<br>50 reasons to &#39;do it&#39; starring Lily and Draco.</i><br><br>(Very AU, but so what? It&#39;ll still be better than the original...)<br><br><br>&quot;<i>Now</i>, Mister Malfoy.&quot;<br><br>Gritting his teeth, Draco forced himself to move slowly - casually - as he turned in his comfortable seat to face this year&#39;s DADA teacher. Professor Potter looked annoyed. She would have looked annoyed anyway, standing as she was with her fists on her hips, but the addition of having her long red hair standing up in all directions, stiff as dry spaghetti, doubled the effect. <br><br>Two rows behind him, Harry &#39;The Git&#39; Potter smothered laughter. His mother didn&#39;t so much as spare him a glance before saying, &quot;You too, Harry. <i>Now</i>.&quot;<br><br>The laughter abruptly ceased, ending it what sounded like a strangled rasp. <br><br>Draco, determined to be more dignified, continued to face The Git&#39;s teacher mother. &quot;Professor Potter,&quot; he began in a languid, airy tone, &quot;I simply don&#39;t understand <i>why</i>.&quot;<br><br>She raised her eyebrows. Inwardly, Draco was certain she had meant to only raise <i>one</i> eyebrow, but of course not everyone was capable of that particular feat - not everyone was born with it. He raised one brow of his own just to prove the point, but unfortunately, she wasn&#39;t interested. Folding her arms as though she weren&#39;t at risk of blinding other students with her red, spaghetti-like spears, she asked lightly, &quot;You need a reason, Mister Malfoy?&quot;<br><br>For just a moment, Draco faltered. That tone... that tone was <i>dangerous</i>. He&#39;d heard it before, and the memory was enough to cause a slight waver in his voice as he replied, &quot;Yes...&quot;<br><br>There was a fractional pause in which Professor Potter&#39;s lip twitched, very slightly, as if she were hiding a grin, and then in one swift move she pointed her wand at Draco&#39;s desk. <br><br>He suddenly found himself facing a stack of at least fifty books. Old, musty, <i>dirty</i> books. Books he didn&#39;t want to lay a fingernail on if he could possibly avoid it. On top of that, they <i>reeked</i> - the sort of old, half-damp stench that could probably kill on its own.<br><br>His controlled, calm expression must have faltered, because Professor Potter then explained, &quot;These texts have been in storage under the library for about three hundred years; Madam Pince discovered them last week and is desperate to have them cleaned of all that mould - every last crease and crack.&quot;<br><br>Draco blanched. <br><br>Sweetly, Lily told him, &quot;So you have a choice, Draco - and Harry,&quot; she added over his shoulder; &quot;Do as you&#39;re told, or this will be your detention. Is that clear?&quot;<br><br>Gritting his teeth, but now for an entirely different reason, Draco swallowed his twelve-year-old&#39;s pride and nodded. Professor Potter briefly glance behind him at her son, who apparently did the same. &quot;Good,&quot; she said, flicking back a strand of stiff hair. &quot;Now do it.&quot;<br><br>With muffled and not-so-muffled sighs, the boys stood up from their desks and gathered the five or six crumpled paper balls they had been magically flinging at each other&#39;s heads before shuffling to the back of the room. Glaring sideways at each other, they took positions on the large muggle &#39;crash-mat&#39; Professor Potter had brought in for &#39;martial arts&#39; practice. <br><br>&quot;Now,&quot; she said lightly, &quot;which of you would like to demonstrate the headlock first?&quot;<br><br><br>~<br><br><br>Hmm, not the ending I was planning on, but I&#39;m short on time so this&#39;ll have to do. Ah, well. </p>

            <p><i>3. Bad Grade by Sugarplumjellygum<br>Hermione goes to Snape&#39;s office to get him to change her Bad Grade and leaves with something worse.</i><br><br>&quot;Absolutely disgraceful, Miss Granger. I expect this kind of tripe from Potter and Weasley, but...&quot; Snape let a ladleful of Brawler&#39;s Broth trickle back into the cauldron and gaver Hermione a sneer. &quot;I suppose we must make allowances for those of us with... less background... in the Arts.&quot;<br><br>Cue sniggers from the other side of the Potions Dungeon and outraged growls from the Gryffindors, mainly Ron and Harry. Hermione said nothing as Professor Snape scribbled a mark on her paper and let it fall back to the desk. <br><br>&quot;He can&#39;t do that to you, Hermione! Your potion was loads better than Greengrass&#39;s or Zabini&#39;s, and they both got full marks!&quot; Ron&#39;s outrage carried over onto the Grounds, where Hermione had accompanied him and Harry for the afternoon.<br><br>&quot;It&#39;s not that bad, Ron. I mean, he always gives the Slytherins better marks than us. It&#39;s useless to get upset about it at this point, really, and it&#39;s only a P...&quot;<br><br>Harry snorted, glancing up from his own Potions paper, which he&#39;d been absently shredding from the corners in the whole walk, having gotten a P as well. &quot;What&#39;s wrong with you, Hermione? Since when do you let Snape push you around like that? I mean, he as good as said right out that you&#39;re less of a witch because you&#39;re Muggle-born!&quot; <br><br>Ron nodded furiously. &quot;That&#39;s just-- that&#39;s not even a bad grade, that&#39;s... that&#39;s a Bad Grade!&quot;<br><br>She frowned for a moment, then abruptly turned back to the castle.<br><br>&quot;Wait-- Hermione! Where are you going?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Where do you think, Ron?&quot; she called over her shoulder. &quot;I&#39;m going to get that grade fixed!&quot;<br><br>Harry and Ron stared at each other for a second, shrugged, and turned back to the lake. <br><br>She paused at the Potions Dungeon. Why the panic? She&#39;d done this in Charms at least three times, asked for a clearer explanation on an essay, talked to Professor Sprout about practical grades&#39; weights against writing and theory... just because this was Potions, and Professor Snape, and... and...<br><br>Unable to finish the thought in a way that didn&#39;t involve leaving, immediately, Hermione took a deep breath and rapped sharply on the door.<br><br>&quot;Come in,&quot; drawled the Professor. <i>How does he manage to make his -voice- sneer?</i> She grimaced and walked into the dungeon, determined not to let him upset her.<br><br>He glanced up for about a millisecond, and then returned to his desk. &quot;Ah, Miss Granger. Here, of course, to complain that you are undeserving of ever being graded as less than perfect.&quot;<br><br>Hermione took a deep breath. &quot;Well, sir, I really just wondered why my potion received a lower grade than anyone else&#39;s, even though there were other potions far less like the finished product, and it didn&#39;t seem like mine was that far off...&quot; She trailed off. Snape hadn&#39;t looked up once, and continued to write on his parchment without pause. There was a long silence. Finally, he finished writing.<br><br>&quot;Untrue, Miss Granger. Neville Longbottom received a D for his potion, and three Hufflepuffs from the period before yours-- ah, but you are a high and mighty Gryffindor, and no doubt inquiring as to the grades of the lower Houses is beneath you.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Professor, we don&#39;t have ti--&quot;<br><br>&quot;<i>As I was saying</i>, Miss Granger,&quot; he continued, with a look that might have been a glare, if there had been any actual emotion in it, &quot;Your main problem seems to be that you received a lower mark than any of the students in your own class-- any Slytherins.&quot;<br><br>There was a bit of a pause, as Hermione struggled to find the right words to answer this, without using words like &#39;favoritism&#39; or &#39;unfair&#39; or &#39;slimy git.&#39;<br><br>&quot;You may not have noticed this, Miss Granger, but your potions are not always deserving of full marks, despite the fact that you are a Gryffindor, and, therefore, can apparently do no wrong.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I wasn&#39;t asking for full marks, Professor, just--&quot;<br><br>&quot;<i>However</i>, (and if you keep interrupting me, Miss Granger, you will receive a detention), if you had paid attention to anything I said in the beginning of the class, rather than scolding your friends for their juvenile doodles, you would have understood the theory of what I was saying, as Zabini did. Your potion may have looked the part of a Brawler&#39;s Broth more than his, but his was closer to the meaning of the potion itself.&quot;<br><br>&quot;...Oh.&quot; She started to speak again, but Snape motioned for the paper, and she handed it to him.<br><br>&quot;Now get out of my classroom, and next time you bother me outside of class, you will simply receive a detention.&quot; She glanced at the paper. The P had been revised to a T. &quot;I do not have to explain my motives to you, Miss Granger. Goodbye.&quot;<br><br>She fled.<br><br>&quot;So, did you get that grade changed, Hermione?&quot;<br><br>She shot Harry a glare and swept past him up to the Girls&#39; Dormitory. He looked back at Ron, bemused. &quot;What&#39;d I say?&quot;</p>

            <p>I haven&#39;t seen any major problems, only minor spelling and grammar stuff. Okay...you capitalized every instance of the word &#39;Mission&#39; even when it&#39;s not neccesarily a PPC mission, you used a comma instead of a question mark right at the beginning (What about the cat), and a few more pronouns would probably make things flow better. The execution scene is slightly vauge, and you&#39;re using commas too sparsely (or is that an effect of the Sue on the wordworld? It would be interesting if it was). Other than that, it&#39;s really very nicely done; in my veiw, the mission&#39;s funny, the characters are well-written, just fix the mechanics and it will be really good when its posted. </p>

            <p>Would you be willing to mark (like in a different color) the places I have missed commas.  Although, it would be funny to blame it on the Suethor, I have a serious problem with grammar, all by myself, especially for commas.  That is why I don&#39;t post stuff for the whole world to see without using a beta, unlike that particular Suethor.  If a large part of the charging involves grammar and it is coming from me, you know it has to be bad.<br><br>Thank you for helping me out.

            <p>I&#39;m close to finishing my latest mission, which has got Logan and Entropy into a bit more trouble than they can handle, between a dragon, a vampire Maia!Stu, and Radagast in the form of a giant grizzly bear!<br><br>While running away from the grizzly, they&#39;ve accidentally left a portal to HQ open for too long, and the grizzly has followed them into the middle of the Cafeteria. With so many heavily-armed agents around HQ, taking care of the bear shouldn&#39;t be a problem, but it seems implausible for all of my other agents to happen to be in the Cafeteria at the exact same time as the portal opening.<br><br>Accordingly, I&#39;m asking if I could borrow some agents for this scene, which will basically consist of:<br>1. Grizzly chasing Logan and Entropy into the Cafeteria (there&#39;s also the grizzly&#39;s pet lynx and a couple of Stus, but the grizzly&#39;s the main concern)<br>2. Agents eating lunch being startled<br>3. Agents drawing many, many weapons<br>4. Grizzly bear dying<br>5. Agents being returned intact and recognisable to their respective authors.<br><br>If you&#39;re happy for me to borrow an Agent or two, the main question I have is whether or not said Agent would be likely to carry a weapon with them in the Cafeteria.<br><br>This will result in two groups of agents: those running away, and those fighting. There&#39;s several bit character Elves, so plenty of targets for everyone.<br><br>While we&#39;re at it, does anyone want to adopt the lynx? It&#39;s Radagast&#39;s familiar, the &quot;Grey Ghost Cat of Rhosgobel&quot;, counts as a Cute Animal Friend, and can only be seen by the light of the moon. It&#39;s called Prishada, but that can obviously be changed.<br><br>Elcalion</p>

            <p>Their first mission (which takes place back in the summer of &#39;09—I still need to write it) will take place before this, so it&#39;s likely that they&#39;d visit the cafeteria between the summer and the time that you base your mission in.

            <p>She&#39;d be a newbie at that time and a loner agent, too, but she&#39;d be there. She turned 18 early in 2006, graduated in the beginning of May, and joined the PPC very soon after (about two or three weeks) when she decided to put her career on hold.

            <p>Not surprisingly enough, it was one of the first fanfictions on the Shrek fanfiction page when I found it. The summary automatically placed it in the badfic category.

It&#39;s too bad that I don&#39;t know the Shrek continuum well enough to honestly spork it, otherwise would have had someone from the PPC hunt down the author and hit her repeatedly with one of the Shrek DVDs (preferably the third movie).

            <p>Same with me. It seems like the post goes up immediately, but Firefox continues to look at an old version of the page. This site does require a lot of Shift+Refresh clicks, but it&#39;s not that much of a problem for me.</p>

            <p>Looks great! I believe that is actually the first MST I&#39;ve read. I might look at them more often now, but I think that I might still prefer missions. More long-term damage. That comic idea sounds cool, though. I vote for that, as long as it is not an enormous amount of extra work for you.</p>
