            <p>A non-anthro feline Sue?  That&#39;s... certainly unusual.  Given that the side effects of cow milk in felines involves loose stool, I&#39;ve also got to congratulate you for avoiding a very ugly pun.  I&#39;ve also got to congratulate you for getting a curiosity joke in fairly subtly.<br><br>Some nitpicks: <br><ul>
<li>&quot;A portal opened and through it two agents entered the abandoned warehouse.&quot; is probably a compound enough sentence to require a comma between &quot;opened&quot; and &quot;and&quot;.  There are two separate verbs (opened and entered) and two separate subjects (portal and two agents), so there are two independent clauses without a subordinating conjunction but with a coordinating conjunction.  While it&#39;s not a perfect rule of thumb, if you can replace the &quot;and&quot; with a period and still have working sentences, the &quot;and&quot; needs a comma.  To quote JulyRose : &quot;An independent clause can be a simple sentence by itself; a dependent clause would be a sentence fragment by itself.&quot;</li>
<li>It&#39;s not clear what &quot;Well, abandoned.&quot; is stating.  Could a word like &quot;mostly&quot; be necessary?</li>
<li>&quot;Its current owners saw no particular use for it so the A-Team were squatting the building.&quot; needs a comma between &quot;it&quot; and &quot;so&quot;.</li>
<li>&quot;The van was parked in the middle of the spacious room and in one corner some living/sleeping space had been set up.&quot; takes a comma between &quot;room&quot; and &quot;and&quot;.</li>
<li>&quot;ball-point pen&quot; has been largely standardized to &quot;ballpoint pen&quot;.</li>
<li>&quot;If Mrs. Baracus had called the phone in the van BA would have heard it ringing too.&quot; needs something separating the adverb clause from the independent clause.  The easiest solution would be a comma between &quot;van&quot; and &quot;BA&quot;.</li>
<li>Formatted as &quot;Stupid Sue not even&quot;, Stupid Sue is being a noun but doesn&#39;t really have a verb to operate with.  You can add &quot;is&quot; after it to get the sentence flowing smoother, or a comma after it to set it apart as an interjection or address (in which case you&#39;re using a silent but understood subject for the reset of the sentence).  If you&#39;re intending slightly broken speech, neither of these changes is necessary, though.</li>
<li>&quot;It was all alone and Face took pity on the little creature.&quot; takes a comma after &quot;alone&quot;.</li>
<li>&quot;Perhaps her foreign correspondency ended,&quot;... I&#39;m not quite sure what word you wanted here, &quot;time as a foreign correspondent&quot; perhaps?  Correspondency seems non-standard.</li>
<li>&quot;The big guy is kind to all animals. Except imaginary ones,&quot; Tasmin added.&quot; may demonstrate a pause better by putting the &quot;Tasmin added&quot; in the middle and/or modifying it to something longer, such as &quot;Tasmin paused for a moment, before adding&quot;.  If it&#39;s an obvious enough addition that any pause in her statements would be very short, this isn&#39;t worthwhile, but it can add a bit of variety.</li>
<li>&quot;In fics where Face has nightmares Hannibal usually treats Face like a little kid.&quot; could use a comma between &quot;nightmares&quot; and &quot;Hannibal&quot;.</li>
<li>This is probably a joke or colloquialism I&#39;m just not getting, but &quot;attachment is no place for a fugitive.&quot; seems confusing, since attachment isn&#39;t a place in the first place.  Moving to &quot;a fugitive has no place for attachments.&quot; is clearer and moves to active voice.</li>
<li>&quot;That has too much lactose and kittens are often lactose intolerant.&quot; could use a comma between &quot;lactose&quot; and &quot;and&quot;.</li>
<li>&quot;Everyone went to their assigned rooms and the agents joined Murdock and Face.&quot; could use a comma between &quot;rooms&quot; and &quot;and&quot;.</li>
<li>&quot;Now Face has something to cuddle and he can let all his childhood suffering and angst go.&quot; might want use a comma between &quot;cuddle&quot; and &quot;and&quot;.  This is spoken word, so you can get away with missing the comma if the phrase needs to feel like it was blurted out, but I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s the case.</li>
<li>&quot;When Face was done talking he pulled the covers over his head and Amy and Murdock knew it would be a long time before he would talk about his childhood again.&quot;, on the other hand, really needs some punctuation after &quot;his head&quot;.  Minimum for correctness would be a comma, but it might be worthwhile to switch out the &quot;and&quot; for a period; multiple &quot;and&quot;s tend to grab focus and increase pace at the cost of clarity, and you&#39;re getting a bad deal here.</li>
<li>&quot;The friend, Toby, had had his arm broken by some local crooks running a protection racket. Because of this he could now not work.&quot;  The &quot;now&quot; is probably superfluous, or at least unclear.  That could go to &quot;could not work&quot; or &quot;could no longer work&quot;.  On the more nitpicky side, &quot;had had&quot; is technically correct, but ugly and passive.  &quot;The friend, Toby, explained that some local crooks running a protection racket had broken his arm.&quot; seems stronger to me.</li>
<li>&quot;When Face and the rat got to the car, Face popped the hood and Hannibal jumped up from the engine space (the engine had been taken out) and aimed an assault rifle at the rat.&quot; is a hilarious mental image.  Could also use a comma between &quot;hood&quot; and &quot;and Hannibal&quot;, or even replace the &quot;and&quot; with a period to reduce overall sentence complexity -- although at the cost of slower pacing.</li>
<li>&quot;The agents were looking at the proceedings of the scene from a safe distance. Relatively safe in an environment that only had a permanent-looking structure because Allison imagined there should be a building.&quot; There&#39;s no independent clause in the in the second sentence.  I&#39;m not sure if that was intentional or not; there are some uses for such things. If not, it&#39;d probably be safer with a comma replacing the period after &quot;distance&quot;.</li>
<li>You probably want to specify who Sammy is before having someone inform him of anything, nevermind put out a cigar on him.  The place where Toby gives directions might be a better place to name-drop him.</li>
<li>&quot;Hannibal loves playing the characters that set up these shops and he loves his cage getting rattled.&quot; actually works pretty well as-is, but it&#39;s not benefiting much from the lack of a comma between &quot;shops&quot; and &quot;and&quot;, even if it doesn&#39;t hurt as much as other examples, either.</li>
<li>&quot;gave the kitten to Amy who he hoped would be more responsible.&quot; would use a comma between &quot;Amy&quot; and &quot;who&quot;, since it&#39;s a nonrestrictive modifier.</li>
<li>&quot;With the rats disposed off&quot; should be &quot;of&quot;.</li>
<li>&quot;&#39;causing all of them to behave&quot; probably doesn&#39;t need the apostrophe, unless it&#39;s a shortening of a longer word.</li>

            <p>You made me think I should perhaps look for a new betareader. I&#39;ve always thought she inserted a lot of commas in my text, you top her. Though, I think, the commas you suggested before &quot;and&quot; are refered to as the Oxford comma, and those are a matter of opinion/personal preference. Although, consistency is a nice thing too.<br><br>* <i>It&#39;s not clear what &quot;Well, abandoned.&quot; is stating.</i><br>The badfic said they were in an abandoned warehouse, but I figured that if people were still making use of it it could hardly be considered abandoned.<br><br>* <i>Formatted as &quot;Stupid Sue not even&quot;</i><br>Where did my apostrophe S go after Sue? Must have missed typing it, so I agree.<br><br>* <i>Correspondency seems non-standard.</i><br>Yep, my spellcheck hated it too. I can&#39;t shake the notion, though, that it is a proper word, and that my spellcheck isn&#39;t up to scratch.<br><br>* <i>&quot;attachment is no place for a fugitive.&quot;</i><br>It was a pun to what Hannibal said: Life on the run is no place...<br>So, yes, that probably was a (intended) joke you missed.<br><br>* <i>When Face (...) bad deal.</i><br>Very good point.<br><br>* <i>You probably want to specify who Sammy</i><br>That&#39;s a habit of mine, I give the OCs nick names (like Sue or head rat) and then not state explicitly that Sammy is the head rat. Although, with the little information that is given, readers could conclude that Sammy is the name of the head rat, or that he just popped up out of no where. In the latter case the agents probably would have made a comment. I will try to look into how to avoid confussion about this sort of thing.<br><br>Thanks for the comments. And for reading.<br></p>

            <p>The Oxford comma, or Harvard comma or serial comma, is the use of the comma to separate the last two items of a list of three or more similar items.  An example would be the second comma in &quot;I need to buy eggs, milk, and bread.&quot;  It&#39;s recommended but (outside of particularly pedantic high school English teachers) not required in American prose, but seldom used in British prose or journalism in any country, except where necessary for clarity.<br><br>The use of a comma before a coordinating conjunction... I&#39;m not quite sure what that&#39;s called.  It&#39;s standard practice in both British and American writing, and not using it in longer or more complex sentences can get in the way of clarity and typically gets some ugly attention.  There are times where it <i>is</i> a matter of opinion/personal preference, like most rules of grammar, and there are exceptions. &quot;He jogged and she sprinted.&quot; will typically be considered as correct as &quot;He jogged, and she sprinted.&quot;, while having faster pacing.  In longer sentences, sentences where there are internal lists, sentences where each clause significantly different structure, or sentences where the connection between each clause is less obvious, it&#39;s very strongly recommended in both British and American English.<br><br>I have no idea what the British rules are for dealing with a comma that is both a serial comma, and also separates a list of several independent clauses, but the only time that comes up in this particular work is a strong enough sentence that you could have comma spliced it without a problem.<br><br>The nicknames thing is interesting.  I&#39;ve not seen it used often before, so my apologies for jumping on it.</p>

            <p>I guess this is what I should expect for writing a grammar nitpick early in the morning.<br><br>In my last post,  &quot;The use of a comma before a coordinating conjunction&quot; should be &quot;The use of a comma before a coordinating conjunction between two independent clauses&quot;, &quot;sentences where each clause significantly different structure&quot; should be &quot;sentences where each clause has significantly different structure&quot;.</p>

            <p>You sound very formal.<br><br>Anyway. I&#39;ve just looked at my online punctuation reference, it calls this comma a &quot;joining comma&quot;. &quot;It is used to join two complete sentences into a single sentence, and it must be followed by a suitable connecting word.&quot;<br><br>Thing is, that in school I learned that there never is a joining comma before &quot;and&quot;. Granted, this was how to punctuate in Dutch, but I also remember English doesn&#39;t use joining commas as often as Dutch does (i.e. less connecting words get a joining comma). <br><br>I&#39;ve looked up some additional references, and I will try to apply the joining comma more often in the future.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m doing an internet Sims legacy game! A legacy game is where you play ten generations of the same family in the Sims with no cheating. <br><br>I want to use people I know from online as the sims that populate the neighborhood to marry in so that I can have a wider variety, as well as have entertaining hijinks. <br><br>Also, so you guys know, if you want to be added in I either need a photo (so I can make Sim-you myself) or for you guys to create your own simself and upload it someplace. If you don&#39;t want to have a photo shown here you can email it to me. :P<br><br>I also need their aspiration, personality, and turn ons and turn off.<br><br><a href="http://sims.wikia.com/wiki/Personality">Personality</a><br><br><br>For personality, there are five categories (Slob-Neat, Mean-Nice, Shy-Outgoing, Lazy-Active, and Serious-Playful) and twentyfive points I must assign. Each category can hold up to ten points, but you can also assign zero points in any category if you want. Least makes them more of the trait I mentioned first, and more points makes them more of the second trait in the pair.<br><br>CAS sims have only 25 points, sims born in game can have more or less.<br><br><br><a href="http://sims.wikia.com/wiki/Turn-ons/offs">Turn ons and Turn offs</a><br><br><br>You get two turn ons and one turn off; choose accordingly from the following:<br><br>Black Hair, Blond Hair, Brown Hair, Red Hair, Grey Hair, Custom Hair, Facial Hair<br>Swim Wear, Underwear, Formal Wear<br>Glasses, Jewelry, Makeup, Full face make-up<br>Fat, Fit<br>Cologne, Stink<br>Vampirism, Lycanthropy, Plantsimism, Zombiism, Robotic, Witchiness<br>Good at Cooking, Good at Cleaning, Good at Creativity, Good at Body, Good at Logic, Good at Charisma, Good at Mechanical<br>Unemployed, Hard Worker<br><br><br><a href="http://sims.wikia.com/wiki/Aspiration">Aspiration</a><br><br>Aspiration is what they want most/are interested in most. Fortune, Family, Knowledge, Popularity, Romance, or Pleasure are the six main aspirations. <br><br>;)<br><br>Also, give me four girl names and four boy names for your possible kids. They don&#39;t have to be normal, one person on another site who I&#39;m adding gave these for girls: Cobra, Jessica, Suzanne, and Logan, and these for boys:  Optimus, Liam, Patrick, and David.<br><br>I have Free Time, which means you can have a second &#39;minor&#39; aspiration, so please choose a secondary aspiration as well.<br><br><br>(Also, please don&#39;t give me stuff if you aren&#39;t willing for there to be a potential possibility that I pair you with someone of the same sex, that you get impregnated by aliens, become a werewolf, witch, vampire, plant person, zombie, and/or become old.)</p>

            <p>Need either an actual Sims 2 Sim or an actual photo. Remaking a Sim in Sims 2 that was from Sims 3 is a no can do because there&#39;s not as much customization for face shape and so on, so I&#39;d only end up with a similar colored generic Sim in all likelihood.</p>

            <p>Recently, I received a full set of the Thursday Next series. Shortly after, I learned of the PPC. It actually kind of saddens me that there are all of five fanfictions for the series (and none of them warrant sporking), because I would so dearly love to see a mission in that continuum.<br><br>You see, the two worlds would go so <i>well</i> together. Think peanut butter and chocolate, or bleach and aspirin. Heck, the PPC could well be a sister organization to Jurisfiction. Jurisfiction is the policing agency within books: they protect the canon from the intrigues, crimes, and disagreements that occur behind the scenes. They also repair the damage to canon produced by fanfiction (among other things). We protect those same canons from outside invaders, and keep the damage from bad fanfic contained. (Actually, when you get right down to it, the TN series is about fifty percent crossover fanfiction, just with public domain characters). It would certainly provide a <i>huge</i> recruitment pool- almost every Jurisfiction agent would make a perfect PPC agent.</p>

            <p>I found them in the bargain bin of my college bookstore, read the backs, and immediately purchased them (this was just before I learned of the PPC as well).  I haven&#39;t read them, though, because I want to read them in order, but I don&#39;t have the first book yet.  In retrospect, I should have asked for those for Christmas...Anyway, the series sounds like pure awesome-sauce to me, and I can&#39;t wait to start reading them.</p>

            <p><i>all of five fanfictions for the series (and none of them warrant sporking)</i><br><br>I should hope not; I wrote one of them. There are a few more TN fanfics on Jasper Fforde&#39;s own site. (Yes, a published author who hosts fanfics of his fandom)<br><br>As far as I remember the books, Jurisfiction does not deal with fanfiction. It deals with what goes on in the book world. Fanfiction takes place outside the book world. For fanfiction to have an effect on canon characters in Jasper Fforde&#39;s universe, book characters would have to be introduced to fanfiction by someone who can travel into books and tell them about it.<br><br>I&#39;ve always figured that there was an annex to the Well of Lost Plots, accessible by one door on the third floor. I had a little scene in mind where Thursday finds the door one day and asks about it and is told the Bayou of Fanfiction is behind that door, and Jurisfiction doesn&#39;t go there. &quot;They have their ... own law enforcement operation.&quot;<br><br></p>

            <p>... is that Jasper Fforde forbids people from writing fanfiction based on his books. So unfortunately the whole thing is a non-starter. It&#39;s still a great idea, though.<br><br>It&#39;s been tangentially looked at before, actually (which is the only way it could be). Agent Quen, from the Department of Personnel, was asked to look into the possibility of cooperation.

            <p>... without wishing to dampen your enthusiasm (and it does sound like a fun series) we have a fairly official policy of not recruiting canon characters, no matter how well they&#39;d fit into our little organisation.<br><br>THAT SAID, there would be nothing at all against someone inventing an Agent who was from that continuum, provided they weren&#39;t a canon character :) And that could be a lot of fun, with the agent talking about differences in procedures and so on and so forth :D</p>

            <p>Hiya. This is slightly off-topic, perhaps, but I&#39;d like to recommend a hilarious cartoon series that I think the PPC would appreciate. It&#39;s called Time Squad, and it was on Cartoon Network for a while, but, alas, was too good to last, ending with two seasons, and they don&#39;t really show it anymore, so you might have to pick up a DVD or look on Youtube to watch it.<br><br>Basically, the premise is this. It&#39;s the year 1,000,000 and the countries of Earth have long since ironed out their problems and merged into one big happy supernation. But, there are still problems. As time moves on, it is discovered that the past is unraveling as it ages, creating lots of very silly time paradoxes that it falls to the Time Squad to correct.<br><br>The Time Squad go in pairs, a human officer and a robot. Each pair is based aboard a satellite and alerted to things like Blackbeard becoming obsessed with saving the whales, Eli Whitney inventing the flesh-eating robot, President Taft perpetrating a Scooby-Doo-style monster hoax, and all that by their annoying, beeping console.<br><br>This series follows one pair in particular, the mismatched Buck Tudrussel and Larry 3000, who have the misfortune of not knowing anything about history. This all changes when, in a mission to the 21st Century, the pick up genius orphan Otto Osworth, who really ends up doing most of the work. And so, they&#39;re off to save the fabric of reality from collapsing.<br><br>I wonder, does any of this sound familiar to y&#39;all?</p>

            <p>Time Squad was one of the last shows I was following when I finally got over my television addiction.  I especially liked the episode with the cheery, pink-obsessed Edgar Allen Poe.  I think what made Time Squad so fun was that it DIDN&#39;T take the plots too seriously, sort of like the way PPC missions are written.</p>

            <p>It could be a sickly-sweet story about Twu Luv. It could be a story about the Sue using the poor Agent for her own nefarious ends. It could be somewhere in between, with the Sue worrying that he doesn&#39;t really love her - that it&#39;s her ex-suvian nature doing it to him. There&#39;s all kinds of interesting places you could take a story, and I don&#39;t think anyone here would object to any of them.</p>

            <p>Good question.<br>I would it suspect to be at least something approaching true love, as agents are usually impervious to Suvian influence, and there is always the Reality Room to go and check how real this love thing is, if you have very practical characters...</p>

            <p>I think there are a couple recruited semi-fic blip characters that have <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Dustin_O%27Grady">at least married</a> other Agents.  Not sure if you&#39;d count pon farr in the True Love category, though.<br><br>Both individuals would probably expect to see some trips to FicPsych, some anti-lustin, and odd looks from other Agents.  Concern about reformed Mary Sues going bad again does not seem unreasonable, as would caution to verify True Love over Twu Wuv.</p>

            <p>I guess. It might be useful for &#39;verses with centaurs in them. But then there is always the fact that this is only my idea of how Centaurian physiology works, and most authors have said nothing about it in their books. So that is effectively something hard to spork, unless there are really big things where more or less everyone knows: That cannot be.</p>

            <p>It&#39;s very short, only about six hundred words.  It&#39;s a conversation between Annatar and Celebrimbor.  It contains very mild slash (i.e. some kissing), which is why I really want a beta; I&#39;ve never really written romance-ish stuff.  (Though Annatar is manipulating the Glaurung out of Celebrimbor, so it&#39;s not exactly <i>romantic</i>.)<br><br>Anyway, is anyone interested?</p>

            <p>Well, I&#39;m not sure I&#39;d be the best person to do it, since I have no knowledge of the <i>Silmarillion</i> whatsoever, though I can promise to do enough research to get a gist of the characters and the story before I look at yours. On the other hand, I do have a decent amount of experience as a beta, a slash writer, and a romance writer, which is what you said you wanted help with.<br><br>I&#39;m on <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/u/1410908/">The Pit</a> if you want to take a look at some of my stuff. I&#39;d warn you away from the earlier stories, since they were written years and years ago, and I will warn you that Emerald Fog contains a &#39;Sue as a (very) minor character, though said story is in the process of being edited and she is slowly dying a gory death. <br><br>The best way to contact me is either via pm on The Pit or by AIM, where I&#39;m known as anamia8742. You could email me (thirteenskater(@)gmail(.)com) but I&#39;m not as good at checking that as I should be.<br><br>--anamia</p>

            <p>I was just talking with Trojie, and we’ve been thinking that there really needs to be more terms for how agents see characters, because right now everything seems to be broadly classed into “Lust Object”. It just seems to us that the term is too narrowly defined. There are pleanty of ways to adore a character without lusting after them – Trojie and I randomly named a few in our conversation:<br><br><i>Mothering Instinct Objects</i>: the ones we/our agents want to cuddle and feed and tuck into bed, like sick hobbits, or as Jay did for creatures like the Watcher.<br><br><i>Fluffy Adoration Objects</i>: Trojie pinned this one quite effectively when she pointed out that imagining an attractive character being domestic and doing something like making breakfast doesn’t qualify as “lust”. <br><br><i>Respect Them Or Else Objects</i>: the ones we/our agnets adore but are not, by any stretch of the imagination, romantically interested in. Dumbledore would probably fall under this umbrella a lot, as would a character like Arwen or Major Kira to non-femslash female agents.<br><br><i>Paired Objects</i>: the ones who come in pairs and are interesting as a pair – either psychologically or just because they have a relationship that ought to be respected on pain of death, like Sam and Frodo, regardless of whether it’s romantic or platonic. <br><br>I’m sure there are more. These all seem to be currently lumped under the heading of “Favourites”, which isn’t inaccurate, but… well, this is the PPC. Do we often leave things simple if we can be more precise? <br><br>Honestly, I’m not really sure what I’m after here. I’m certainly not suggesting that every agent’s profile be altered to have listings for all the above sorts, just looking for ideas, I guess – trying to categorise them more accurately, since this is only from our point of view and more minds could make things clearer (or just come up alternate names for these Objects, if you can think of something better, because these aren’t too great).<br><br>In short, what are your thoughts?</p>

            <p>I may be reading this wrongly, but I assumed that &#39;Lust Objects&#39; were... well, precisely what they sounded like, whereas &#39;Favorites&#39; were characters you respected and adored but by no stretch of the imagination lusted over. So, for instance, my (soon to be forthcoming) Agent holds Draco Malfoy as a Favorite and Pierre Gringoire as a Lust Object. (Actually, the only reason she doesn&#39;t lust over Draco is that she&#39;s a total slash fangirl, and so much prefers him with other men, but that&#39;s a different story; there&#39;s a <i>reason</i> she transferred to DBS.)<br><br>I agree, though, that &#39;Favorite&#39; is too broad a term. I like the ones you suggested, and would add in a couple of other possibilities:<br><br><i>Anti-Favorites:</i> Characters you love to hate. People like Professor Umbridge would be in here, or possibly Mrs. Bennet.<br><br><i>Favorites of the Intellect:</i> Characters you just want to have a conversation with, possibly over a nice dinner. Hermione, for instance, might qualify, or Aragorn.<br><br>Those are all the ones I can think of at the moment. I agree that the agents&#39; profiles probably shouldn&#39;t be altered to have them all, but possibly once we organize the list a bit more we could make a new page and just link the &#39;Favorites&#39; category in the infobox to that.<br><br>I&#39;m quite fond of the Paired Objects. I agree that there are many characters you only like when paired with someone else. Fred and George Weasley spring to mind, or Alice and Jasper Hale (yes, I&#39;m a slight Twilight fan. Not a rabid one by any stretch of the imagination, but I&#39;m rather fond of those two.) It&#39;s nice to have a shorthand way to express that as opposed to the rather cumbersome, &#39;Draco. Well, only Draco when he&#39;s paired with Harry in plausible goodfic. And only when he&#39;s in character.&#39; (Actually a lie; I am quite fond of our Mr. Malfoy in all of his evil, canon glory, but the point remains.)<br><br>--anamia</p>

            <p>And yes, you&#39;re right - at the moment everything&#39;s either grouped into &quot;Lust Object&quot; or &quot;Favourite&quot;, which works, but I just find them lacking.

            <p>I think that is a great idea. This sorting into either L.O. or Favorite is a little crude to my taste. Of course, it depends on the agent what kind of Objects they would have. All in all I also like the categories you offer and I think they cover about anything there is.</p>

            <p>Sorry if I nitpick a bit overmuch.<br><br>One character -- I think one of Trojie&#39;s, Agent Gypsy -- had his eyes on Serenity, and insisted on the &quot;registered subject of adoration&quot; official term in a mission years ago, rather than a Lust Object.  I&#39;m still brainstorming my characters, but I was planning to have one be nonsexed, and have him use that name while his more normal partner stuck with the more common Lust Object.  So there are ways to communicate nonsexual interest in a canon, even if not everyone necessarily believes you.<br><br>It seems the question would be if you want to have a character with something in each category listed, or want to have a normal sized list of Lust Objects, but be able to further detail what type of adoration is going on.  In the former case, trying to come up with a half-dozen broad categories makes a lot of sense.<br><br>  In the latter, though, I think you&#39;ll run into problems trying to get any amount of agreed definitions.  The character I was toying with would have a &#39;thing&#39; for fighters with a strong personality, but while Legolas woobiefication would drive him up the walls, he&#39;d never respect an elf or adore someone for being domestic.  Something that&#39;s precise for him wouldn&#39;t work for most other characters, just as something that&#39;s precise for Stormsong wouldn&#39;t work for most other agents, or how a description of Discworld kleptomania might not be common.  In that sense, something more along the lines of putting the description of how the item is adored within parentheses, perhaps with a few established examples, and using the Object Of Adoration superset might be easier.<br><br>That&#39;s just the newbie viewpoint on it, though.</p>

            <p>Frankly, I&#39;m more just after viewpoints and possible silly names that we could throw around for various sorts of Favourites. I&#39;d also like my agent to be able to say she has a Fluffy Admiration Object in a mission without having to explain it, I guess (one of Agent Sedri&#39;s less overt traits is her total denial of having a Lust Object, you see - I added the quirk to make her more fun to write). <br><br>Certainly, there won&#39;t be unanimously agreed definitions, but I thought it might be fun to play a bit. You have a point, of course - some agents&#39; liking of canon characters simply won&#39;t fit into general definitions. Maybe in those cases they could make up the names - after all, there are no rules, as long as it doesn&#39;t get too ridiculous. &quot;Object Of Adoration&quot; could work, though I imagine it could get shortened down to something like &quot;who&#39;s your Object?&quot; in context, which would be... strange.<br><br>(As for the nitpicks, don&#39;t worry - I do it a lot myself when working with clients, or when beta reading missions or fanfics. I just didn&#39;t want you to feel like you had to point them out.)</p>

Linkage:<br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3708179/1/"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3708179/1/">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3708179/1/</a></a>  It&#39;s a horrendous piece of fiction that I wrote after receiving the first Ultimate Avengers movie as a birthday present... and now, reading it, I realize just how much I needed that flamer to come onto the review board.<br>So, to actually get a point here--what&#39;s the worst piece of fiction that you&#39;ve ever written and,(god forbid)posted? Have you deleted it, or kept it, jsut to remind yourself of how bad you were? I keep this one, and a number of gems that shall never see anything but the bottom of my underwear drawer, just to remind myself of how far I could fall.<br>Eh. I&#39;m rambling...and avoiding homework...and my missions(but don&#39;t worry, I&#39;m *trying* to write them!)<br>-Honu_Wahine</p>

            <p>Most of the ones I wrote down were relatively good, in hindsight. But the ones I didn&#39;t write? Hoo-boy. Sheer canon-raping horror. (Especially where certain male canon characters were concerned...) I thank myself for never having written them down.</p>

            <p>I wrote a Pern piece, long ago. This was before words like &quot;Mary Sue&quot;, &quot;self-insert&quot;, and even &quot;fanfiction&quot; were even in my vocabulary.

            <p>I didn&#39;t start out my writing hobby with fanfiction. I went through a stage where I wrote bad original fiction, but luckily I took down the small percentage that I posted. I did write a short, unfinished fanfiction in the sixth grade. I have it in a notebook somewhere and I could probably dig it up. I wrote it because I disliked the fact that A Series of Unfortunate Events ended without all of the mysteries solved (although I like the ending now). It didn&#39;t go too far OOC, but I didn&#39;t know how to write well, so my grammar and style butchered it. The entire idea was that I would write a sequel to <u>The End</u> starting from the very moment after the canonical ending. I was going to have them go on an adventure and solve the mystery that has been bugging me for ages: the Great Unknown. Meh, I&#39;ve moved on from that fic, though. I have no desire to go back to it, even though it would be fun to think up answers to all of the mysteries Snicket has out there.</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve got some ugly skeletons in my writing closet as well.  Most of it from before the Pit existed, and the very worst of it before Geocities or I even had internet access worth mentioning, but that didn&#39;t stop me from dropping the stuff out.<br><br>I&#39;ve saved my work, since there&#39;s often decent Plot Bunnies under the horrible pacing, consistently interrupted tone, and non-existent characterization, but I&#39;ve rarely posted since someone lifted a pretty non-trivial part of one of my older ones.  He&#39;s welcome to have it -- <a href="http://premium1.uploadit.org/gattsuru//excerpt_one.txt">horrible, horrible writing</a> -- but I don&#39;t like having stuff that&#39;s unfinished out there nearly this long.  I have no idea how anyone managed to make a politically charged supernatural thriller with an odd take on who is hunting and who is hunted <i>lack conflict</i>, but a younger me did.<br><br>Whether that just general pathetic output, or <a href="http://premium1.uploadit.org/gattsuru//excerpt_two.txt">depressingly clinical and artificial</a>, a lot of stuff is painful to look at.  It took the better part of a year of practice to get anything where the result <a href="http://premium1.uploadit.org/gattsuru//excerpt_three.txt">wasn&#39;t a given</a> and where the pacing worked out.

            <p>I was about twelve, maybe younger. It was for <i>Star Wars</i>, and it was awful. I think I wrote three little stories at once at that point, and they were all just plain BAD attempts to &#39;fix&#39; what I didn&#39;t like about Padme and Anakin&#39;s story. I can&#39;t remember the titles I gave them anymore, and I most certainly deleted them - along with the author account and the related email address. I wanted to completely wash my hands of it. <br><br>I also remember making up an original character, Ciorina, who was a standard <i>Lord of the Rings</i> Mary Sue, at about the same time, and to my own credit, I looked through the hobbit family trees in order to find a plausible great-grandparent for her, but she was half elf and half hobbit, so I grovel in shame nonetheless. <br><br><br>(That said, missions should be FUN!

            <p>There are a lot of unofficial sequels, essentially published fanfiction, running around, and most of them are positively assballs. I was wondering what the PPC&#39;s position on these is. Do we just grit our teeth and consider them canon to the original work? I should think (and hope!) not, but I can&#39;t think of anything that specifically excludes them, either.<br><br>Like, if you were on a Phantom of the Opera mission, would you have to take Frederick Forsyth&#39;s hideous sequel as part of the original canon?

            <p>Movieverse is usually accepted to be a separate canon from bookverse. In general, I&#39;d say that applies here as well, especially if the sequels contradict the Canon. (For example, Pride and Prejudice and Zombies is definitely not the same canon as P&amp;P itself.)</p>

            <p>If the fic were explicitly set in Leroux&#39;s <i>Phantom of the Opera</i>, for instance, but the Phantom was running around in a white half-mask and spouting lines from the musical, then I think that would be a charge. HOWEVER, if it isn&#39;t specified, then you would just treat it as an AU and only worry about things that would break ANY version of PotO. Or if they simply don&#39;t make sense together, then maybe you could treat it like a bad crossover.<br><br>~Neshomeh, who is actually a fan of Susan Kay&#39;s <i>Phantom</i> and has been known to blend elements of that version with the original in RPs and such.</p>

            <p>Here&#39;s another mission for you. Much, much thanks to Neshomeh for being my beta; I&#39;ve been all self-conscious about my missions ever since I wrote a flop last year. I&#39;m hoping you like this one.<br><br>Chliever and Winston continue their neverending slog through Starjeffry&#39;s &quot;work,&quot; and they&#39;re about to crack. During a lull in the fic, they even try to hide from the mission! Will they succeed?<br><br>Well, no, because it&#39;s fun to torture your Agents. But they do get some oddly meaningful discussion in. Less gross than this author&#39;s other stuff, but still probably NSFW. Here you go:<br><br><a href="http://agent-chliever.livejournal.com/3699.html"><a href="http://agent-chliever.livejournal.com/3699.html">http://agent-chliever.livejournal.com/3699.html</a></a><br><br>And yes, Harry Potter Fanwank Bingo does exist.

            <p>The author of The Catcher in the Rye died on Wednesday.  Even though we don&#39;t seem to see any badfics of his works, I wanted to bring it up.<br><br>Salinger never allowed Catcher to be made into a film, despite numerous requests.  Hopefully his wishes will continue to be respected now (especially since the Movie of the Book always seems to attract Mary-Sues).<br><br>There&#39;s also a rumor that he had some unpublished manuscripts in his home.

            <p>I just watched the Buffy the Vampire Slayer episode &quot;Superstar,&quot; in which a minor character casts a spell to make himself the best of everything, and changed everyone&#39;s memories so that they thought he&#39;d always been that awesome.  Joss Whedon wrote it specifically to make fun of Mary-Sue fanfic.<br><br>Then I remembered the Torchwood episode &quot;Adam,&quot; which involved an entity who altered people&#39;s memories to make him think he&#39;d always been there, although it was a lot creepier than the Buffy episode.  And it got me wondering if there were any other characters like that, and if the PPC had investigated these phenomena.  It seems like such characters could give the agents some insight into the reality-warping nature of Mary-Sues.</p>

            <p>Season 3 episode 3  &quot;Irresistible&quot;<br><br>This episode first introduces Lucius, played by Richard Kind.  The character is annoying, obnoxious, loud mouthed, rude, and overly intimate (not so much in a sexual way, though he does have something like 5 wives-more in a I know everything about your life and you want me to way.)<br><br>Yet everyone loves him almost instantly.  Not just loves him, but would die for him, would protect him from any insult or discomfort-however slight, and pines for him whenever he is gone.  Everyone except Shepherd who has been shown to have an awful cold since before Lucius shows up.<br><br>Lucius turned out to have some kind of formula that sort of intoxicated anyone that smelled it.  It was sort of like a love potion that worked on everyone around the person taking it.  Shepherd kidnaps Doctor Becket and keeps him long enough for the effect to wear off and Becket to work his magic (medical magic) to negate the effect.  People were not particularly happy with Lucius when they sobered up.  Especially not the people of his home village.<br><br><br>Also, the 5th season episode 4 of Stargate SG-1 titled &quot;The  5th Man&quot; involved an alien that exuded a chemical that made a person coming in contact with it susceptible to the suggestion that the alien was in fact someone they knew and had good reason to not kill.  In the case of this episode that the alien was a relatively new 5th member of the team.  I don&#39;t think the alien really counted as a Mary Sue (well Marty Stu-it took on a male persona), as the only reason it did this was because the Jaffa were tracking it down and trying to kill it.  It eventually fessed up, and tried to lead the Jaffa away so the team could escape.  They used the distraction to kill off the Jaffa and save the day.  The alien went off to a rendezvous with others of its kind to continue hiding from the Jaffa. <br><br>I think Lucius definitely counts as a Marty Stu though.  His Stufluence was mighty strong.</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve been cautious to accuse Torchwood fic of OOCness. I&#39;m always keeping an eye out / hoping that in later chapters it is revealed there was an alien mind control thing or something going on.<br><br>Is never the case though.<br><br>----<br><br>Another canon-Sue is the character Jackie Knox from the show Voyagers! She takes over the &quot;saving the day&quot; job from the canon characters and both canon males fall for her. There&#39;s no reality altering spell or mind control going on here; it was just bad writing by the canon authors. Luckily, in the next episode they had forgotten all about her.</p>

            <p>I loved your story and the minis.  Next time you have some NCIS minis floating around, I would like to adopt one.  I run into a lot of misspellings in it.</p>
