            <p>So, I guess this would be my official entering into the PPC board. This is actually my first time on the board, the last couple of weeks have been spent on the Wiki, learning what&#39;s what and following the links to adventures or random PPC Agents.<br><br>I&#39;m actually glad i found this (The PPC), theres been a huge lag in all the good machinama and abridged series.  <br><br>Anyway, I was watching  Metal Gear abridged, and the third episode had this song I was interested in (carameldansen), so I searched for a whole version of it, and the video was of an anime called Lucky Star, which I ended up watching. After a couple episodes, I went on a quick jaunt to FF.Net, and found it had an (understandably) small fandom. <br><br>Among them, was one that was for the Anti-Cliche and Mary-Sue elimination society, and after reading it I was confused. Another quick jaunt to TvTropes, lead me to an explanation of it, and led me to the PPC which sounded a lot better to me. Fastforward a couple of weeks (and about 20 or so PPC stories) and here I am!<br><br>So, theres my strange story of getting here, and i&#39;m interested in joining, one month waiing period dosent sound bad to me at all. So, to everyopne out there, NICE TO MEET YOU ALL!</p>

            <p>Just keep a copy of those links around so you can help out another Newbie when it comes time, and all shall be good.<br><br>As for fandoms, I&#39;m glad you asked. I&#39;m into Negima, Disgaea, Persona, Bleach, Naruto (only some, taking awhile to make my way through the backlog of episodes, y&#39;see), Death Note, Code Geass, Soul Eater, Chobits, Gravitation, When They Cry, Harry Potter, Dune, Artemis Fowl, Lord of the Rings (Not much though, pretty much just The Hobbit really), Gorillaz, and I used to really be into The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy when I was younger and it was still on the air. Oh, and did I mention that I am really, really into Disgaea? Those games will make you into a level-grinding fanatic if you&#39;re on a tight budget.</p>

            <p>I love Disgaea too! I&#39;m borrowing Disgaea 2 from my friend. I love going to the Item World, so much to do, so little actual time. Come to think of it, I haven&#39;t even LOOKED for any disgaea fics, I should try, could find something good. Or something REALLY bad, then I can spork it! Win-win scenario!<br><br>I&#39;ve read a LOT of fanfics (see: dad getting angry at my habit of reading). Though I tend to not even look for new fandoms. Well, variety is the spice of life, more fandoms, more chances for ideas.<br><br>Naruto, poor Naruto. I used to love the series like my first video game (Sonic the Hedge Hog 3). After Shippuden started, it just seemed to veer off into &quot;who has the better power-up,&quot; kind of like Dragonball GT. Though I still enjoy the fandom immensely.</p>

            <p>Another Disgaea fan! Hmm, I prefer the 3rd game myself, but I did like the fact that you could actually tank in D2, unlike all the 1-shot fests higher levels tend to boil down to in the other two.<br><br>As for Disgaea fics, Well, they&#39;re definitely out there, and I have seen a few good ones and quite a few bad ones, so take your pick. Actually, I&#39;ve got one of each you can look at if you&#39;re so inclined. <br><br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5856060/1/Fail_to_the_King"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5856060/1/Fail_to_the_King">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5856060/1/Fail_to_the_King</a></a><br><br>That one&#39;s one of my favorite Disgaea fics out there, although it&#39;ll have some spoilers, and you won&#39;t recognize a bunch of the characters unless you&#39;ve played the third game. Still, worth a read IMO.<br><br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5851384/1/DISGAEA_Judgment_Day"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5851384/1/DISGAEA_Judgment_Day">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5851384/1/DISGAEA_Judgment_Day</a></a><br><br>This one, on the other hand... Well, it&#39;s a nonsensical scriptfic that throws practically everyone OOC, most notably Pleinair and Almaz, who I&#39;m thinking are a pair of character-replacements, and that&#39;s just in the first chapter. There&#39;s twenty six chapters in all.<br><br>As for Naruto, It&#39;s too bad it fell into the typical shonen super-power surge, but honestly, where else could it have gone, harem comedy? Ehh, it&#39;s still pretty cool-looking stuff, and it has one hell of a community, so it gets a passing grade, even if it does need to shave off a couple dozen pounds of filler.</p>

            <p><br>Yeah (shudders) I am SO glad it never came to that. Cthulhu knows that there are way too many harem fics for the fandom as it is.<br><br>The final nail in the coffin for the series, for me, was probably all the &quot;new&quot; powers of the Sharingan, it just seems too much like an instant power up device to me. Dont get me wrong, I liked it until the whole Mangekyo stage, then it got ridiculous.<br><br>I don’t hate it though, it actually keeps the story interesting, unlike so many anime, which just peter out.<br><br>I also like the Persona series, I was watching my friend play it, we got a lot of laughs out of it. We&#39;re both extremely genre savvy, avid readers of tvtropes, and he spends a lot of time in forums, so it was endless amusement.</p>

            <p>1: If the author of a fic couldn’t be bothered with describing their Sue as she appears in the story and has instead put in a bio in the form of an Author’s Note (“Height: 5’6, taller than most woman because you can fight…”), does that count as the story?

            <p>To answer your question, saving Gandalf from falling with the Balrog is not enough, by itself, to completely screw up the canon.  However, if there is rampant OOCness, a blatant Sue, and none of it makes any sense then that might be a good place to kill something.  You have to back up something like that with other charges.<br><br>To tell you the truth, I can see some ways that a &quot;Gandalf didn&#39;t fall in Moria&quot; story could work (I got some weird looks from Neshomeh for expressing that).  So, you have to make sure that you back it up with other charges.  One charge is not enough, even if you believe it is a major game-changer.  We don&#39;t kill just any badfic, we kill the worst of the worst.</p>

            <p>While Phobos is completely correct in everything he said, I feel personally that his post doesn&#39;t contain NEARLY the amount of foaming-at-the-mouth rage a Tolkien purist like me feels at the very idea of someone on ff.net thinking that was a good idea. I mean, YES, it COULD be done, but the quality of writing on the Pit is just so generally terrible that the chances of anyone pulling it off are so minuscule as to be nearly nonexistent. If a Sue is involved, I can&#39;t see it at all. Ever. So, consider this your daily dose of nerdrage; the old-fashioned kind that got this organization started lo these many years ago.

            <p>There&#39;s so much inherently wrong with that premise! You&#39;d have to at least <i>acknowledge</i> what a huge gap it would be! The Balrog is still alive! Gandalf not falling is just... <i>Ai!</i> He never gets reborn, the Fellowship doesn&#39;t have that tragedy, the experience in Lothlorien would be utterly and completely different and quite frankly even if it was handled well, the whole thing is just... <i>argh.</i><br><br>...Ahem.

            <p>So, if a character in a real-world-based fandom set in a time period that&#39;s not 21st-century Western Earth sings a song that is from 21st-century Western Earth, it&#39;s a charge, particularly if they take credit for the song. What about if it&#39;s in a fandom which is loosely based on the real world but already contains some anachronisms and/or far more surreal things than anachronistic songs? What about if the song in question doesn&#39;t contain any material that shows it couldn&#39;t possibly have been around at that time?<br><br>Asking for guidelines because I found a Who Framed Roger Rabbit fic board which is filled with <i>utter garbage.</i> (No, the Toon Patrol do not need a spunky girl joining, sapping their personalities and evilness entirely, and turning them into interchangeable puppets to make her look better. Is it so hard for me to find a decent weasel fix without added Sue? And incidentally none of them seem to remember that the movie is set in 1947 ...) However, was thinking of writing some better fic for it, and am entertained by the thought of the weasel in the straitjacket singing Emilie Autumn&#39;s &quot;Miss Lucy Had Some Leeches&quot;. Which is a far better song than most of the ones these ficcers pick.</p>

            <p>1) The crash dummy has nothing to do with the description of the Sue.  It has everything to do with the point of view of the story (first person, for example).  However, I would count the AN in your example as part of the story because it does give information that is important to the story.<br><br>2)Sues do not have souls, per se.  They have been observed to have wraiths that sometimes need to be dealt with after the Sue has been.  Using the term &quot;soul-mate&quot; does not indicate that there is a soul.  It is a way for a Suethor to try to legitimize their pairing.<br><br>3) All you can do is tell people about the PPC.  Even people who have every intention of joining in the long-term sometimes disappear.  Not much we can do about it.

Just...excreble writing, terrible characterization, and a badly-thought-out plot. Also three chapters of nothing but author&#39;s notes; vague descriptions that are tossed in at the beginning of chapters; and chapters that are mostly dialogue, with little actual discussion of what&#39;s supposed to be going on, and rapid scene transitions.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m not a FULL part of the PPC yet, but I can tell it is definitely bad, in chap 22, the author introduces Sasori and Kimimaru, way OOC. There might be some possession sues (characters who act COMPLETELY different) I didn’t read the whole thing. It&#39;ll definitely need an exorcism. However, that&#39;s just my opinion.</p>

People seem to have forgotten that among the hallmarks of a truly Good &#39;Fic (and therefore, a good community of writers) is mastery of the English Language. I understand that while trawling for badfic, it&#39;s easy to lose your way, but if you find yourself falling into the habit of leaving off capitals, ignoring the Common Comma, and mixing up your two, too, and to&#39;s, they&#39;re, their, and there-- is an answer. <i>Stop reading badfic</i>! We must beware, lest we fall into the same traps we so despise. Remember, nothing bolsters a canon against destruction like goodfic! We&#39;re not in danger of running out of &#39;fic to spork anytime soon, so it&#39;s okay to stop looking and assuage your brain with your favorite well-written epic from time to time. (I heartily recommend <i>Don&#39;t Panic!</i> and <i>Okay, NOW Panic!</i> for these purposes-- and of course, PPC-centric &#39;fics are also rather lacking in English errors.)<br><br>Now that I&#39;ve rambled on a fair bit, there was an actual point to this post... ah, yes.<br><br>Please, please, <i>please</i> double-check your posts for grammar/spelling/syntax errors before you click &quot;Post Message.&quot; This is, after all, a group based around writing skill; it ill becomes us to have our home base riddled with basic errors. It&#39;s okay if not every post is perfect; we all make mistakes. But a little bit of proof-reading goes a long way, and if you treat your posts as if they&#39;re important, you&#39;ll find yourself making fewer mistakes when you write &#39;fic.<br><br>This has been... a public... service... announcement! <s>With <i>guitars</i>!</s> <br><br>Thank you for your time; we now return to your regularly scheduled insanity!</p>

            <p>While I was playing aroud with the files of an old RC cars racing game (Re-Volt), I found out that the three cars going around in the Options menu (cars normally not avaible for use in the races, and even when hacked in they are very slow and with horrible handling), while the directories of the files are called wincar1, wincar2 and wincar3, the name that appears in the selection menu when hacked in are Wincar and Wincar Three for the first and the last, but the second one is called Wincar Too.

            <p>Certainly, no one is going to throw a tantrum over one or two missed punctuation marks or a typo or slipped capital - we all make those kinds of mistakes, and more overt ones - but what VM was saying is that it&#39;s becoming too common, and that in some cases people clearly aren&#39;t even bothering to re-read their own words before hitting &quot;post&quot;, and that is quite hypocritical for a community that prides itself on pointing out errors. The &#39;point of the PPC&#39; <i>is</i> an almost-obsession with accuracy, and while, again, we&#39;re not going to make a fuss out of a little mistake here or there, when people mix up to/too/two or there/they&#39;re/their, it&#39;s going to be picked up on.<br><br>And that said, I&#39;m not sure if anyone around here actually <i>is</i> a high school English teacher, but a large number of us are definitely the type.

            <p>It&#39;s not generally done in missions, because for a large number of Agents having to go through and pay close attention to every bit of a fic would drive them round the bend (unless it&#39;s a very short fic). If you want to snark at <i>everything</i>, you&#39;d probably be better off writing an MST. Which is great fun, especially if you partner up with someone else to do it. :D</p>

            <p>When you snark every line of dialogue, you&#39;ve written an MST. Personally, I don&#39;t consider those missions, because there usually doesn&#39;t happen anything else than the snark. There&#39;s usually not much of a story. I guess it would be possible to have mission things happen, such as writing down charges, admiring the scenery (or commenting the lack thereof), getting on each other&#39;s nerve, i.e. have a story and still snark every line of dialogue. <br><br>For a mission you need permission, for an MST you don&#39;t. There are no rules concerning how you write a mission, other than the rules that apply to writing fanfic. That means you are allowed to write a mission where you snark every line of dialogue. Though I don&#39;t really see why you would want to. </p>

            <p>I don&#39;t really expect to be doing a MST-style anymore.   Earlier I read the mission for Doom: Repercussions of evil. It shows a good way to write a mission for a short badfic.<br><br>I guess I&#39;ll just write in a lot of agent interaction, which should be fun.</p>

It was funny enough to almost make that vomit-inducing fic bearable. Bleh. Thinking of it too much makes me queasy, so I&#39;ll just say this. Needing a matchmaker, Sue or not, is a bad sign. It&#39;s just a quick-fix, and therefore unsatisfying, solution. We want delicious character and situation build-up, dammit!

It&#39;s the site where I found <i>Tomie</i>, and it houses a grand total of twenty-one different horror manga, some by Ito. Now, you must know that aside from <i>Flesh-Colored Horror</i>, these stories are unfamiliar to me, so you&#39;ll have to proceed on your own discretion. As for <i>Flesh-Colored Horror</i>, it&#39;s a collection of six unrelated stories, called <i>Long Hair in the Attic, Approval, Beehive, Dying Young, Headless Sculptures,</i> and <i>Flesh-Colored Horror</i> itself. Scared me something <i>fierce</i>. Blood and body horror aplenty, yet again. Tread with caution.</p>

            <p>What about manga/anime which aren&#39;t set in Japan? So the anime itself is Japanese, but the characters aren&#39;t. And would the shaveandahaircut thing work the opposite way, on characters who are French or something but the cartoon is in English?</p>

            <p>If anyone has any suggestions or ideas or whatnot, please tell me.<br><br>My initial concept: Originally a bit from a badfic, [name undecided yet] had no physical description and only as much designated personality as a single Trollian conversation would expose. I&#39;m thinking she&#39;ll be somewhat messed-up due to a bad transition from troll culture to PPC life. May be dependent on bleepka, I dunno for sure. I&#39;d probably give her Generic Grey blood resulting from the poor description in her home fic.</p>

            <p>As some of you may or may not have noticed, I&#39;ve been away for quite a while (several months here on the boards, and ~3 weeks in the irc), mostly due to an attack of Real Life. In the interim I have regrettably not been writing nearly as much as I should have, not that I wrote as much as I should in the first place, but I&#39;ve recently been writing less. I&#39;m hoping to get back into the swing of things, and I figured going back to beta-ing wound be as good a place to start as any, so instead of asking for a beta reader, I&#39;m sending out a general call for anyone who needs a beta reader to keep me in mind.<br><br>If I&#39;ve done things right, my email address should be linked in my name. If not, then it can be found on the beta reader list on the wiki. Alternatively, if you want to actually discuss things instead of having me just check for errors, then I can (hopefully) be found in the irc regularly from now on, or you can poke me via email and I&#39;ll provide my IM information.<br><br>Incidentally, I figured this would be a better way to ease myself into things than, say, trying to fix all of the spelling and grammar mistakes in My Immortal again.</p>

            <p>I thought this community might be interested in the following news as many here feel strongly about LGBT-rights.<br><br>A transsexual man requested from the university where he had graduated (the University of Amsterdam) a new diploma. When he graduated he was still a woman, so the diploma has his former female first names on it. Now he is a man and he finds it awkward to show his female diploma to prospective employers, because his sex change is not something he wants to discuss at a job interview.<br><br>The university refused to issue a new diploma. On the grounds that it can&#39;t issue a duplicate in a different name. The university argued the law would have to be changed for that to be possible.<br><br>The man brought this case to the Committee on Equal Treatment (which can make non-legal binding recommendations. The Court generally follows the recommendation of the Committee if a party decides to sue.) Also, at the university a student group for LGBT-rights started a petition to encourage the board of the university to change its mind.<br><br>Today, the minister of Education said that the law allowed a duplicate diploma in a different name, and the university has said that man will receive a new diploma, with his male first names on it.<br><br>---<br><br>How are things in your countries when it comes to transsexuals needing new diplomas and such things after their sex change?</p>

            <p>I&#39;m someone who whole-heartedly detests any and all forms of discrimination, so I think that it&#39;s only natural that this man is going to get a new diploma. It&#39;s his right, after all.<br><br>Now about the question you asked. Here in Belgium, when a person enters university and has a sex change during the course of their studies, they will initially receive a diploma with their old name on it. However, as soon as that person&#39;s new gender has been legally recognized (following a medical examination and such), a new diploma <i>will be</i> given to that person.<br><br>Incidentally, my society is extremely tolerant of LGBT people. We&#39;re one of the very few countries to permit civil marriage between same-sex couples, with all the same rights as heterosexual marriage. Just look at <a href="http://ilga.org/Statehomophobia/ILGA_map_2009_A4.pdf">this map</a>. Adoption by same-sex couples, too, is legal since 2006. Hate crimes and discrimination are practically unheard of here. Case in point. In 1997, a dockworker named Ronny Van Sandt, then aged forty-seven and married since 1974, underwent a sex change operation and took on the name Priscilla. Afterwards, she went right back to working at the docks, and none of her male colleagues had any problems with that. No harassment or anything. I might add that Priscilla&#39;s wife Jeannine, while at first a bit doubtful about the whole arrangement, still supported her throughout the whole thing, and that the couple did not stop having sex after the operation.<br><br>I know this is a lot more information than you asked for, but it gives me a little glow of pride to be able to say it.</p>

            <p>And I understand your pride. I&#39;m kind of proud that the Netherlands was the first country to allow same sex marriages. Even though I had no more part in that, than that I voted for one of the parties that formed the government that changed the law on civil marriage.<br><br>Hate crimes are a growing problem, though. More incidents have been reported in the past few years than at the beginning of the decade.</p>

            <p>Good for him, and right on board with the faith in humanity.<br><br>As to how such things are handled-- in America, I think it depends very much on the region, because Federal law is a good fifty years behind the rest of humanity. In California, for example, a school would probably not mind issuing another diploma-- New England it would vary wildly from town to town, depending on who was on the school board/university board/what have you. It might be prejudiced of me, but I wouldn&#39;t expect much from the majority of the Deep South and midwest.<br><br>The thing about this country is, it moves less like a single entity and more like a spooked herd of mustangs-- a few false starts, some charging off in the wrong direction, and nobody runs exactly the same way, but eventually we get all fifty states on the same path, mostly.</p>

            <p>Because I am totally left-wing. As for my country, I know California&#39;s still working out its Prop 8 issue, but I&#39;m not sure about America&#39;s stance on transsexuals or the LGBT community as a whole. I&#39;m glad that things like this are happening, though; at the very least, it&#39;s proof that the world is moving forward.<br><br>I spend a lot of time worrying about these issues, though. I&#39;m lucky enough to live in a very diverse area, so most of the people in my community are very open and accepting about race and orientation and such. Still, though, I hear about violence and hate crimes happening every now and then, and it scares me. Like I said, I live in a very diverse area, so a lot of my friends are gay or bisexual. It really hits close to home.</p>

            <p>and point out that transgender issues don&#39;t really have a lot to do with gay issues. If anything, gay issues have massively overshadowed trans issues, to the point that trans issues have been badly neglected. Overt transphobia is much more socially acceptable than homophobia, transgender people have horrifically bad prospects for employment, and are victims of violence on a daily, nay, hourly basis. <br><br>A gay person&#39;s sexuality is a political target, but for a transgender person it&#39;s their very being. Things like the first post are just the first steps. The Netherlands have usually been progressive on LGBT issues so I was shocked to find out this was an issue in the first place - highlighting the uphill struggle transpeople face.<br><br></p>

            <p>I don&#39;t know how it is in America--maybe others do--but I would hope that since a legal name-change is something that is done, it would make sense to change it on all important documents, including a diploma.
