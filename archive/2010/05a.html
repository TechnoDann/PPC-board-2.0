            <p>We just can&#39;t help ourselves. This is another interlude with our most recently partnered Agents, Teek Virtanen and Kayla Richards.

Teek meets some of Kayla&#39;s friends and finds out that there <i>are</i> friendly people in the PPC.<br><br>The interlude is posted on both our LJs, in two parts as it was looooong.<br><br>Lycaenion&#39;s LJ: <a href="http://rc1764.livejournal.com/2670.html">Part one</a> and <a href="http://rc1764.livejournal.com/2999.html">part two</a>.<br><br>And Cassie&#39;s: <a href="http://cassie5squared.livejournal.com/30431.html">Part one</a> and <a href="http://cassie5squared.livejournal.com/30632.html">part two</a><br><br>Hope you get some sort of entertainment out of it.

            <p>My month is up in two days, and I just realized I don&#39;t have anywhere to post missions! If anyone has any suggestions, I would love to hear them. I would like it if it isn&#39;t the sort of place that would double-check the age registered in my email account and then ban me from seeing my own stuff, or the sort of place that would make me hang around a month before they let me post anything (Just kidding, I love you all).<br><br>I&#39;m considering making my own site to put missions on, but I&#39;m not the best at site design so it would either take a lot of time (making it look okay) or a bit of cash (paying someone else to do it), and it might also be a bit harder to find, so...yeah. Suggestions please?</p>

            <p>Well, there&#39;s Livejournal, which I know a lot of people use for PPC-related stuff (including myself!). It&#39;s simple and easy, and there shouldn&#39;t be an age-restriction problem - and even on the free accounts there&#39;s a great number of good-looking layouts.<br><br>Ditto Webs.com - they have an easy page editor and pretty layouts that number in the hundreds.<br><br>Good luck, and I can&#39;t wait to see what missions you&#39;ll do!</p>

            <p>I think it&#39;s time I finally spoke up and stopped being so quiet about this. Anyways...<br><br>I&#39;m considering leaving this without accomplishing anything, which would make me feel really bad, as I&#39;ve got a lot of potential in this community. I&#39;m not saying that I am leaving, I&#39;m trying to say that I have some serious doubts as to whether I should be here or not. When I first joined this, I felt rather confident about my writing and everything. Now, I&#39;m pretty irked at the whole thought of everything, having my ideas and plans torn to shreds in the coldest, most emotionless manner possible: by telling the flat out truth. No lies, no excuses, just &quot;We don&#39;t like it, go try again&quot;. I know the truth hurts, but when it&#39;s this painful...<br><br>I enjoy writing, and so do you people. Unfortunately, I managed to misinterpret practically everything about the PPC, and didn&#39;t see it in time for me to notice that what I was writing was perhaps the total opposite of what&#39;s supposed to be done here. Instead of getting a lovable cast of wacky, funny characters from me when I tried for permission, you all received a side of me that I&#39;d rather not show... All my hate of things and general displeasure with life ended up being revealed to the world in a grisly display of canon defilement, disturbing implications and a group of experimental characters designed to deconstruct the PPC concept down to the ground. I&#39;m sorry for that, but if I tried to write in the more familiar, funny way that you&#39;re all used to, it wouldn&#39;t be me writing, it would be the collective will of the community guiding my hand, telling me what to do and not wanting my own input. <br><br>It&#39;s not only that, though. My problems run deeper. I don&#39;t understand the jokes, the humor- what it apparently is all about. It&#39;s hard to say this, but I actually haven&#39;t laughed at anything for a while now. Looking around now, it&#39;s pretty darn obvious that if I don&#39;t understand the humor, I won&#39;t understand how to write in a funny way without it seeming forced and half-assed.<br><br>In other words, it wouldn&#39;t be fun for me if I changed to suit the wants of this community. You want another writer of silly, funny stories that make people laugh. Fine, you&#39;ll get it- Provided it isn&#39;t me. Funny isn&#39;t &quot;fun&quot; for me to write, it&#39;s almost as agonizing as throwing myself into a vat of sulfuric acid, not to mention it seems forced and awkward. I don&#39;t want to throw away all the hard work that I poured my love, my soul into... just in the name of &quot;fun&quot;, and if you can&#39;t accept that, or you think I&#39;m not being honest, it&#39;s fine with me. I know that there&#39;s some good in this community, and that you&#39;re all trying to help me become a better writer, but I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;m just hurting myself and the community by being here like this, that&#39;s all.<br><br>- MAXinsanity</p>

No longer is this about venting my anger and disguising it as something else, it&#39;s about telling a story, and getting that story out no matter what.<br><br>I don&#39;t need to change, nor does my writing need to. What I do need to do is control myself more, and find a comfortable middle ground for me to write on. Looking back at it, all that hate and negativity was drowning out the actual intent in my writing...<br><br>Thank you all for the positive support, and thank you all for such a wonderful community with such variety, but most importantly (and perhaps ironically), thank you all for making me see that I am not a perfect writer, and denying me permission back then. It was a necessary step in my development not just as a writer, but as a better person.<br><br>But enough of that, We&#39;ve got stories to write, and those sues aren&#39;t going to kill themselves!<br></p>

            <p>I don&#39;t know much about this, admittedly, as I&#39;ve not written any missions myself; but I don&#39;t think humor has to be silly. It can be cynical and sarcastic, if you like; there&#39;s lots of precedent for that; or it can be part of a more serious story. (Ever read the Dresden Files series? It&#39;s a prime example.) I don&#39;t know if you want to keep trying; but I do think that a big world like this takes all kinds of styles. There&#39;s a lot of room for drama between agents and in the various continua themselves without ever touching HQ or pulling other people&#39;s characters in.<br><br>As for me, if I start writing missions, I will probably make them at least somewhat serious--though the potential for poking fun at bad writing is still my main motivation. I couldn&#39;t write if it weren&#39;t at least somewhat serious; but think about this: If there weren&#39;t any humor in a serious piece, don&#39;t you risk making the drama seem over-the-top angsty? And if there isn&#39;t any seriousness to a humorous piece, doesn&#39;t it just get fluffy and inconsequential? I really think you can find a way to fit your style in.</p>

            <p>As others have said, you don&#39;t have to write PPC works to hang around here - I&#39;ve been around for five years and only got around to finishing missions a couple of months ago, and some never write missions at all.<br><br>I don&#39;t think we&#39;re looking for someone who&#39;s going to write exactly the same way as everyone else, cause that would be boring! <br><br>Neither do I think that PPC&#39;ing and dramatic writing are mutually incompatible - hS&#39;s Reorginisation and Crashing Down are prime examples of dramatic PPC writing.<br><br>But I think as a whole, we&#39;re comedy first, leavened with smatterings of drama, rather than the other way round. <br><br>We&#39;re probably still a little bit cautious of drama after the proceedings of the last couple of years with the overdose of Emergencies, but I think it&#39;d be possible to write a dramatic PPC story without having Daleks invade HQ or anything like that, by focusing on character drama rather than &quot;Mary Sue Invasion&quot; drama.<br><br>Anyway, this is just my $0.02 - the last thing I want to do is tell you how to write, or force you to change your writing style- but hopefully food for thought?<br><br>Whether you write PPC missions or not, hope you&#39;ll stick around the board, but if not, farewell, and go with our well-wishes for your every endeavour.<br><br>Elcalion<br></p>

            <p>Many of you probably won&#39;t even recognize my name because I&#39;ve been gone from the boards so long, but once I was quite active in the PPC and I&#39;m currently a long-time lurker.<br><br>To tell the truth, I can relate with you 100%, MAXinsanity. You don&#39;t see me around the boards much anymore because I&#39;m not really sure where I fit in- I&#39;ve doubted myself just like you.<br><br>I love the PPC community. I was drawn in immediately because of a mutual love for pure Lord of the Rings canon. I love this group for that, and I love missions as an idea, but I could never get myself to do it in actuality. I&#39;m too much of a softy to pass such harsh judgement. I admire young people who are trying to express themselves in fanfiction writing. Sure, some fall flat, but they&#39;re /trying/ (and that sure counts as a lot in my book)!<br><br>Anyways, I think there is a lighter side to the PPC underneath all the &quot;cold criticism&quot;. You guys make me smile still every now and then. I&#39;ve decided to politely refrain from posting any typical missions. I&#39;m okay with that decision, and I&#39;m sure the PPC would be okay with that decision too. <br><br>Point is, ultimately it is your choice to go or stay. But the PPC is full of a bunch of lovelies whether or not we can always see that in ourselves. I don&#39;t think anyone wants to make you think badly about yourself or your writing.<br><br>So I offer you a nice big *e-hug* and I hope you&#39;re happy in whatever decision you make.<br><br>In fact, e-hugs all around!<br><br>-A Random Boo</p>

            <p>My writing tends to skew dark and grim as well, but I joined the PPC hoping to branch out. However, if you don&#39;t want to do that (and that&#39;s fine - if everyone wrote the same kind of thing, all of us would be very, very bored) then definitely don&#39;t force yourself. I&#39;m just curious as to why you think you&#39;d have to &quot;throw away&quot; your work. Maybe I&#39;m misinterpreting, but it seems you feel that once you write PPC missions, that&#39;s all you can write. I&#39;m no expert on the rules, traditions and regulations, but I&#39;m pretty sure that&#39;s top quality bovine sewage. <br>(As a side note, isn&#39;t there precedent for PPC deconstructions?)<br>However, all of that notwithstanding:<br>If you do leave, I wish that the best of everything comes your way.</p>

            <p>You shouldn&#39;t try to force your writing to conform to anyone&#39;s standards-- not ours, not anyone&#39;s. It&#39;s alright if you don&#39;t want to write lighthearted comedy, it&#39;s alright if you&#39;re not into parody, it&#39;s alright if you don&#39;t like satire. Seriously! There is <i>nothing</i> wrong with drama, angst, emotional writing. Fiction, even fanfiction, is an art-- and like every other art, what it means is up to the artist. It&#39;s like John Barth&#39;s Funhouse-- if a silly mirror to you is morbid and freakish, and you don&#39;t get why everyone&#39;s laughing, that&#39;s okay. (I&#39;ve always been a bit freaked out by those things myself.)<br><br>But this community isn&#39;t just for people who write crazy satire. And don&#39;t feel like if you never write a mission, you haven&#39;t accomplished anything! Please! I&#39;ve been here five years or so, and I&#39;ve never written a mission or an MST or, really, anything in canon except my agents&#39; introduction drabble. At this point, I don&#39;t even really intend to. I just hang out because it&#39;s an interesting place, an interesting canon, and <s>I happen to like the people here</s> the conversations are eye-opening.<br><br>And I am sorry that the response to your writing was painful, Max-- I know it hurts to have something you wrote and cared about ripped up. Don&#39;t take it too much to heart-- I mean, definitely <i>listen</i> and absorb what you think will make you a better WRITER. If you don&#39;t want to be a PPCer, then don&#39;t worry about the PPC-centric advice. You can always ask us for concrit (on the chat, if not here), and there are plenty of us who would greatly enjoy a drama/angst/emotional fanfic in another fandom. <br><br>So, I guess my point is, don&#39;t feel like you have to leave just because you don&#39;t think your style works with the community. If you do feel like you have to leave, as Sedri said, we won&#39;t stop you. But don&#39;t think that just because you got turned down, or you don&#39;t want to write humor, we don&#39;t want you around.<br><br>Good luck, though, in whatever you choose to do.</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve been looking around the wiki for general information about the PPC. I have a question: How much is known about the Janitorial department? There&#39;s not much information there.</p>

            <p>First, they&#39;re a division of the Department of Operations, not a department. They may or may not be the same people as <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Building_Maintenance">Building Maintenance</a>, which is pretty much what it says on the tin. Of course, considering that the building in question is actually a series of tunnels spanning perhaps hundreds of dimensions, all hooked together by invisible, stabilized plot holes--and considering that PPC Agents live in said building--I&#39;m sure you can imagine the kinds of things they have to deal with.<br><br>Even if they&#39;re not the same people, simply cleaning up after agents is bound to make for the occasional interesting story. I&#39;d be interested to see what you come up with, if you&#39;re thinking of writing such a one. {= )<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Division, department... Dang, I thought I had that down. Oh, well, I checked it out and I&#39;ve got it now. I think. Departments are sometimes made up of divisions, but not vice versa.<br><br>Anyway, I&#39;m just playing with the idea at the moment (don&#39;t have permission so can&#39;t do more; and don&#39;t have enough background research as-is, so wouldn&#39;t be ready in the first place). Seems to me that maintenance and janitorial would be closely related, but not entirely the same thing, considering that repairing a hole in a wall requires a slightly different skill set from cleaning up Suenicorn blood.<br><br>But, since the same talents are required for both jobs (attention to detail; endurance; some degree of physical strength; ability to think in more than three dimensions), it would not surprise me if the departments work closely enough together to share agents and tasks. It also wouldn&#39;t surprise me if they know an awful lot of things--both about the PPC and HQ--that most people don&#39;t know.</p>

            <p>And who has yet to write anything for them but has something eventually planned involving the SO and a bomb and a large hole in the wall, I can state with fair sureness that BM doesn&#39;t share agents with the janitors and that a few BM agents also have a grudge against some of them.  <br><br>Also, I think in one interlude floating aroundsomewherenearTrojieland many hallucinogenic/used for drugs of the recreational variety Flowers comprise part of the janitorial staff.</p>

            <p>Is Janitorial made up entirely of Flowers? Or do they haven non-Flower members too?<br><br>I&#39;d think, that if the Flower members of Janitorial were in it to avoid Agents, you&#39;d have to have non-Flowers to clean the heavily-populated areas. On the other hand, they might simply be good at making themselves scarce.</p>

            <p>I started reading this a while back, but sort of lost touch with it and forgot most of the things that happened. I&#39;m rereading it now, and I&#39;m realizing just how cussing good it is.<br><br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/u/1178956/Wren_Sharpbeak"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/u/1178956/Wren_Sharpbeak">http://www.fanfiction.net/u/1178956/Wren_Sharpbeak</a></a><br><br>This writer on fanfiction.net basically wrote a different version of the third season of Avatar: The Last Airbender. Usually I&#39;m quite jaded by fics like these; most writers steal a lot of material from the original canon, or they simply surgically inject a Mary Sue protagonist into the middle of things and somewhat modify the events to make said Sue look good. This writer does none of that. She manages to take the storyline in a different direction while still staying true to the how the canon works. Most OCs have fairly minor roles, and those that don&#39;t (such as General Huo) are well-written and quite likable. While this writer does seem to be a Zutaran, romance is very much NOT the central part of the plot. I hate the pairing myself and it hasn&#39;t gotten on my nerves.<br><br>All in all, a very enjoyable set of fics. In my opinion, this writer is like the Henry David Thoreau of the Avatar fandom; she manages to return the canon in better condition than before.</p>

I didn&#39;t until a couple of days ago, but you should put your images in them after you upload them!

In some cases that was because a new file is being used instead, and I deleted some of those, but there are still others I wasn&#39;t sure about. If you&#39;ve uploaded images to the wiki, please go through them and make sure you either do something with them or delete them. Otherwise they&#39;re just taking up someone&#39;s server space.

He&#39;s rather bad-tempered, but is more &#39;endearingly grumpy&#39; than &#39;gets angry a lot&#39;. He pretends not to, but he&#39;s very fond of his partner and quite loyal to her. He has an awful tendancy to wax philisophical, maniacal, or just plain weird, and listens to techno &#39;music&#39;.

She has a tendancy to adress everyone as &#39;matey&#39; or &#39;good sir&#39;. Leila isn&#39;t actually very good at fighting, but she was assigned to DMS because a) from her DoI days, she&#39;s gotten very good at assembling chargelists, b) she&#39;s one of the few Agents who knows how to work the HQ computers, and c) she&#39;s very familiar with the various canons Agent Riddick isn&#39;t (familiar with).

            <p>So, I just recently got a LiveJournal account (actually, for PPC purposes, so I&#39;m probably going to be asking for permission as soon as I have some good samples up) and I was just wondering what&#39;s considered polite or okay there. Is it considered okay to friend people you haven&#39;t talked to so that you can see when they post stuff, or is that considered annoying? Is it normal or correct to post original fiction? How long are analysis... things advised to be before everyone wants you to shut up? Anything else I should know? And can someone help me make the stupid LJ-cut actually work?</p>

<li>From what I&#39;ve seen, it&#39;s considered polite to ask first, but not essential. Also, don&#39;t be concerned if they don&#39;t friend you back; usually it just means they don&#39;t care to have your entries come up in the same interface as their preferred set, or else they don&#39;t want you to see their locked posts.<br><br>2. It is entirely normal and permissible. I know of more rec-and-link communities for fanfic than for original fic, but that&#39;s probably because I look more for the former.<br><br>3. Unless you become particularly incoherent or rude, odds are you won&#39;t be actually asked to shut up. That said, it&#39;s preferred to have entries beyond &quot;a certain length&quot;, or containing several images, behind a cut. That certain length is fairly ill-defined; as a rule of thumb, I&#39;d place the cutoff at two decent-sized paragraphs, or an equivalent length of shorter ones.<br><br>4. <s>This is where I pimp <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/milliways_bar/profile/">Milliways</a>, right?</s><br><br>5. Ansela&#39;s already answered this one, so I&#39;ll just reinforce a couple of points. Remember the quotation marks. Remember the dash (&quot;&quot; as opposed to &quot;&quot;). Conversely, if you want to insert the username of another user or a community, leave out the dash.</li>

            <p>Friending: my usual rule is &#39;ask first&#39;, especially if the person in question also posts personal/RL stuff to the same journal as their fics.

It&#39;s not exclusively a fanfic archive a la ffn after all. There are many, many things on LJ that aren&#39;t in any way connected to fandom.

Seriously, it&#39;s more trouble than it&#39;s worth and it&#39;s a lot easier to hand-code everything than rely on the RTE to not eff up.

            <p>I would like to request Permission to write for the PPC. Here&#39;s a link to a sample of my writing: <a href="http://silikat-lj.livejournal.com/">My Livejournal.</a> It&#39;s the story of how Toon became an Agent.<br><br>Here are my Agents:<br><u>Agent Silikat</u>: She is a giant brown and black tabby cat, a Jellicle form the Cats continuum. Actually, she’s five foot two, so she’s small for a human but large for a cat. She was recruited from her home continuum by Agents Ekwy and Gecka, who stopped by there once in a while. Silikat has a permanent case of fleas, rendering her quite grouchy and irritable, although she is happy after the death of a Sue. She’s very sarcastic and prefers to work alone, so the S.O gave her a partner, Toon, who she detests but puts up with for the sake of killing Sues. She’s in the Department of Mary Sues, Freelance Division. Her Lust Objects are The Master, Severus Snape, Draco Malfoy and Macavity.<br><br><u>Agent Toon</u>: Toon was recruited from a badfic Silikat once entered. She was Captain Jack Harkness’ wife in a cut flashback, and fell through a plothole on top of Silikat. She, therefore, is not allowed on missions in the Torchwoodverse unbtil she has learned to control herself. She is annoyingly perky and optimistic and can be very naive at times. She has shoulder-length black hair, pale skin and hazel eyes, although this is her after the Sue part was taken out. She is quite stocky and plump, much to her annoyance. Toon is one of the only Agents who can be excited about going on a mission, but she hasn’t had too many yet, so that will most likely wear off. Her Lust Objects are Harry Potter, The Doctor, Jack Harkness and Neville Longbottom.<br><br>Here is the badfic I plan to kill as my first mission if I get Permission: <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5913742/1/Alexandra_Pond">Alexandra Pond</a><br><br>I would also like to know how to request an RC, since I have no clue myself, and how to adopt a mini from a fandom with no Agents in.<br>And...that&#39;s it, isn&#39;t it? Feedback on the writing sample is appreciated very much. Thanks!</p>

For example, this:<br><blockquote>The S.O. was sitting behind a desk, staring at them. Well, Silikat assumed it was staring at them, as it had no eyes and therefore no expressions. Apparently, it came with being a Flower. The sight of a Sunflower in a business suit made the Sue behind her gasp, but just made Silikat think about how bizarre her job was.<br><i>Silikat, what do you want? And is that a Sue?</i> The Sunflower demanded, pointing a leaf at the pair.<br>“Brought this into HQ. Don’t really know what she is. She fell through a plothole.” The Jellicle explained, still aware that the Sue was staring at them slack jawed. Irate as she was, Silikat just wanted to get rid of her, sadistic as she was.<br><i>Did you think of asking it?</i> The Flower sounded sarcastic, and Sili gulped. No, she hadn’t thought of that, but since when was an Agent capable of logical thought?</blockquote>

<br>I used square brackets to highlight changes, and the red bit is repetitive language, which you also want to watch out for. {= )<br><br>Otherwise, I like the agents, I like the story (is it based on one you wrote?), and I&#39;m interested to see what you do now.

            <p>You&#39;ve got quite the odd couple going there with your chirpy fangirl partnered with the seen-it-all (semi-)veteran. At first I expected her to get on his nerves, but it looks as though he&#39;s getting paternal instead. All in all, nice. He almost reminds me of one of those film noir detectives--you know, the kind of guy you hear in a voice-over going, &quot;It was a dark and stormy night...&quot; Matches with your first-person perspective, too.<br><br>My editor sense is tingling a bit. I see a few overused words, some minor grammar errors, and a few instances of awkward wording--nothing bad, though, and nowhere near the level where it distracts from the story. I suggest a beta reader.</p>

            <p>So, I&#39;m trying to MST <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/badfic_quotes/1001124.html">that awful RPS fic I mentioned a while back</a> (link not-work-safe). Anyone willing to join in? You don&#39;t actually have to know anything about the characters involved, just be able to make smartass comments about the fic.<br><br>Also, a couple of badfics:<br><br><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2749666/1/Finding_Fate">Finding Fate</a>, in which the Sue is gay for teenage Noodle. Props for originality, but utter sucks to the ending. Okay, so we&#39;re talking about a universe in which brain damage turns your hair blue and one doesn&#39;t run into legal difficulty of any sort when deciding to keep an amnesiac child you found in a box. Also, while I can&#39;t buy that Murdoc would care at all about this girl, I can buy that he could be persuaded to help her for Noodle&#39;s sake. However, I cannot buy that DEADLY NIGHTSHADE would cure a GUNSHOT WOUND, nor can I imagine that the hospital staff would let a scary-looking guy and a teenage girl barge into the intensive care unit and inject an unidentified substance into a patient! Even if it worked!<br><br>I&#39;d like to claim this one, but the problem is I&#39;m on a couple of LJ communities which used to be frequented by this writer and I don&#39;t know if they&#39;re still there. I don&#39;t want to risk having them follow the link back to my journal and possibly find this. Any advice? I don&#39;t think they&#39;re still active in the fandom and it&#39;s unlikely they&#39;ll go trawling through the comm friends, but just in case.<br><br>The second badfic is up for grabs, though I&#39;ll take it if nobody else wants it: <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/ASadStory">A Sad Story</a>, dubbed &quot;A Bad Story&quot; by the wags on TVTropes - the linked page explains the fun far better than I could. My favourite line in the whole thing: &quot;Then his uncle pulled out a shotgun, with a silencer on it.&quot;<br><br>And the third, a Legendary Badfic in the FF7 fandom, which is thoroughly non-work-safe and up for grabs because I know nothing about FF7: <a href="http://ficbitches.livejournal.com/14411.html">Chocobo Nights</a>. Best summarised by the Ficbitches&#39; line &quot;TIFA JUST GAVE BIRTH TO A F---ING CHOCOBO.&quot;<br><br>In other news, someone on TVTropes <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanficRecs/Gorillaz">put one of my fics on the fic recs page</a>. Yay!</p>

While we obviously don&#39;t know what the Abbeydwellers&#39; response to homosexuality would be, I have my doubts that it&#39;d be as much of a complete non-issue as it&#39;s portrayed here, and the fact that the Stu is a stoat would definitely be a really, really huge deal.</p>

            <p>And by explaining, I mean confessing and apologizing.<br><br>&quot;Nitset&quot; isn&#39;t real. She&#39;s my - I think the term is sockpuppet. That whole fiasco regarding Boosette got to me more than it should have; specifically, what she said about bullying. It ate at me, because I was worried that she might be correct about the &quot;bullying culture&quot;, and if she was I didn&#39;t want to be a part of it. So I decided to create &quot;Nitset&quot; and post like I did in order to have positive proof about whether the PPC seeks to hurt people or just to have fun and encourage good writing. <br><br><i>Pulling a stunt like this was incredibly stupid and wrong of me, and I&#39;m truly sorry. </i> <br><br>I should have realized that I would get a response like this. I should have showed you guys more respect. I should not under any circumstances have contemplated taking the word of some person I&#39;d never met over my own observations of your kindness and welcoming spirit. Anyone with sense would have realized that the accusations of a &quot;bullying culture&quot; were ludicrous, given the friendliness of everyone. I also had no right to deceive you guys the way I did.<br><br>I&#39;m really disappointed in myself, both for the foolishness in this and for betraying my principles by assuming the worst without good reason. I&#39;m also saddened that I&#39;ve jeopardized my standing in a community I admire and respect, especially since that respect and admiration for you guys has increased exponentially. I hope I haven&#39;t done anything that will change the response to any real Nitsets who come along. I also hope you can forgive what I did here.</p>

            <p>You&#39;ve vindicated us. Or, more specifically, we unintentionally vindicated ourselves thanks to an opportunity you provided. What&#39;s to feel bad for? Yes, there was a small deception involved, but I, for one, can <i>easily</i> forgive that. :)<br><br>As a side not, when &#39;Nitset&#39; first posted, I also wondered if maybe she was one of the people on the other side of the debate seeking to test our actual reactions. I&#39;m not sure why - I don&#39;t know if there was anything in particular that made me think so, and it certainly didn&#39;t occur to me that Nitset might be anyone other than she said she was.

            <p>That might not be the best way to get a feel for the PPC welcome, but I can&#39;t think of any other way you could have done it, short of recruiting an actual Suethor. That&#39;s getting a bit <i>too</i> involved. Anyway, I suggest saving <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=195990">the link</a> to combat any future accusations of bullying.

            <p>I&#39;m being a gigantic sap about this! (I&#39;m a gigantic sap about everything, really.)<br><br>I did some sockpuppetry of my own when I was younger, and received a pretty vicious backlash which, though it happened a few years ago, hasn&#39;t completely died down yet (some people out there are still mad, methinks).  So one, it was nice to see that people here were kind to a fellow repentant sockpuppetmaster.<br><br>Two, I was a Suethor too (albeit unpublished but I thought my Suefics were really hot stuff, back then).  And though my Sue-ing days are just about behind me (I have some Original Fiction Sues I haven&#39;t completely given up on), putting myself back in those shoes...the response is pretty heartening in that people here were so willing to help and build up instead of mock and tear down.

            <p>*hugs*<br><br>Ye gods. This world needs more people like you, Wide Eyed Idealist. *grin* For all I&#39;m not advocating deceit or what have you, it makes me pretty happy that 1) someone on the &#39;Board was suddenly afraid they&#39;d fallen in with a group of snarling wolves, and tested accordingly-- I understand, it can be a hard thing to judge from the inside of a group! It makes me really happy that, rather than immediately going, &quot;But they were nice to me! These critics must be crazy,&quot; you actually tested to make sure. 2) Really, really happy you got the response you did, for obvious reasons. (I&#39;m almost certain we&#39;ve had civil, somewhat friendly discussions with Suethors before-- there&#39;s a thing somewhere in the Constitution that says &quot;If you like Sues, most people here will disagree, this is probably not the place for you,&quot; but it never says you can&#39;t post here at all.)<br><br>So! You are a Very Cool person. ^_^ Thank you for doing this, and then not being too scared to explain later.<br><br>(Though I will say, I&#39;m with the above posters on the rather obvious thing-- that&#39;s partly why I didn&#39;t respond. It was too convenient for someone to come looking for help just weeks after we&#39;re accused of being unhelpful bullies. I figured it was either one of Boosette&#39;s crowd, wondering whether we&#39;d act the monsters they thought us.)</p>

            <p>Don&#39;t blame yourself. You must admit, we&#39;re certainly worthy of scrutiny. There are many people like Boosette who hate us, and many of them have excellent points. This was a rather ill-planned way to make yourself sure of our good intentions, but I cannot fault you for wanting to make sure in the first place. I&#39;m reasonably sure most of us here have had similar doubts about our own ethicality. <br><br>Don&#39;t beat yourself up about how you should have expected our reaction, either. Perhaps you should have, but again, I believe you were well within your rights to see if we practice what we preach. You said you shouldn&#39;t have taken the word of someone you&#39;ve never met over ours, but have you really &quot;met&quot; any of us more than you have her? <br><br>The last thing is...I expected this. As soon as I read the post, I thought that it was a fake to test our merit. To my knowledge, no sporked &#39;Suethor has ever come to the PPC for help until much later, when their writing is a lot better. Also...this is the kind of thing I would have done. I did something like this in the past, though a long time ago and not on the internet. I though that Nitset was a puppet, but I didn&#39;t say anything because I was hoping I was wrong. It&#39;s a pity, really. I don&#39;t blame you at all for testing us, but I am truly sorrowful that Nitset doesn&#39;t exist, and I&#39;m fairly sure no one like her will anytime soon.</p>

            <p>I have absolutely nothing new to say, but I&#39;m going to say it anyway. {= )<br><br>First of all, it&#39;s so awesome that you came to us asking for help. As you can see, that makes us very happy, and we&#39;re willing to do anything we can. We know criticism sucks, but the fact that you were able get over it and make the decision to improve puts you head and shoulders above most other amateur writers out there. I salute you.<br><br>Unfortunately, I don&#39;t know anything about Beka Cooper, either. It&#39;s still a good idea to post a link to the story so someone who does know something can have a look at it.<br><br>I agree with Barid that it might not have been one of us saying they were going to spork your story, though. We don&#39;t generally tell fanwriters if we write missions to their stories.<br><br>Finally, I guess this is new: is English not your first language? I&#39;m just curious. Either way, I know a couple of really good online resources for improving your mechanics, and these are them:<br><br><a href="http://www.bedfordstmartins.com/hacker/writersref/">A Writer&#39;s Reference</a> by Diana Hacker. Contains instructional and interactive material. Play around with it and see what you find. {= ) She also has a book by the same title, if you care to find it. I had it as a textbook in college.<br><br><a href="http://www.wsu.edu/~brians/errors/errors.html">Common Errors in English</a> by Paul Brians. Also comes in book form, which is how I know about the website. Entries are alphabetical. What&#39;s really nice is that he includes differences in American and British usage when they appear.<br><br>One important thing to remember is: if you&#39;re not sure about something, double-check it. {= )<br><br>Again, welcome to the Board.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Like what has been said before, everyone starts out poorly at the start. <br><br><br>That said, there&#39;s two very important things about writing.<br><br>1) Enjoy it. If you enjoy writing, everyone else can just stuff it. Even us.<br><br>2) Accept constructive criticism. When you&#39;re able to do that, you&#39;re able to improve loads more than you would be able to otherwise, and if you actually get anything out of the concrit to improve yourself, it leads to enjoying your work even more.</p>

We are all here to become better writers--well, that, and to have as much fun as possible!<br><br>Welcome.<br><br>Oh, and, regarding grammar, spelling, and writing in general, I have two tips:<br><br>1. Read. A lot. The more you read, the more you get to know the patterns of language, and the better you can follow them.<br><br>2. Before you publish, get a beta reader. Track down the local grammar nazi, and get them to pick over your work for grammar and general readability. (Spelling you can leave to spell-check, except for homonyms.)</p>

It is something that all of us here are striving for and we will help you out as much as we can.<br><br>Now, I have a couple of questions for you:<br><br>1) Can you provide a link to your story?

There are many groups that do sporkings, and they all have different ways of going about them.

If you could give us some information about your story, it could help us tell you what someone thought was worthy of sporking.  Just hooking up with a canon character wouldn&#39;t be enough.</p>

You wrote that story because you were angry, and I&#39;ve written some not so great stuff while feeling rather emotional.

            <p>And I have learned something from this thread. The wiki article on Muphry&#39;s Law references a meaning of &quot;pasties&quot; that is, um. Well, considering my sister&#39;s mother in law makes them for my niece... It&#39;s a tad <i>surprising</i>. And now I&#39;m left wondering where the hell in the world &quot;pasties&quot; means &quot;nipple covering&quot; instead of &quot;pastry-based luncheon with dubious meat and onions and un-mentionable pig parts inside&quot;.</p>

            <p>Well, compared to a few trainwrecks I&#39;ve seen, you&#39;re actually pretty good.  From what I can tell in your post, you seem to have spelling pretty much down, and that&#39;s good.  You also said you want to write &quot;well,&quot; not &quot;good,&quot; and you used the correct &quot;to&quot; instead of &quot;too&quot; or &quot;two.&quot;  Yup, from a grammatical standpoint, you&#39;re not half bad.  You&#39;re not *completely* there yet, but you&#39;re not half bad.<br><br>I do have a few tips for you, though.  Number one: words like &quot;don&#39;t,&quot; &quot;couldn&#39;t,&quot; and whatnot need an apostrophe.  That serves to indicate that two words have been merged together.  So, it&#39;s &quot;don&#39;t,&quot; not &quot;dont.&quot;  (By the way, once you have that down, it can help you with other problems like the difference between &quot;there&quot; and &quot;they&#39;re.&quot;  If the meaning you&#39;re looking for is &quot;they are,&quot; i.e. has two words, then the word you&#39;re looking for is the one with the apostrophe.  That&#39;s how I mastered that particular problem.)<br><br>Second.  I&#39;d recommend you review your period, and comma rules.  To illustrate my point, I&#39;ll use one particular sentence from your post.<br><br>&quot;I read a lot of the mission things and they were funny but it kind of hurt to realize that you guys thought my story was that bad but I got over it and now I&#39;m hoping you guys can help me write better because I dont want that to happen again.&quot;<br><br>This is a run-on sentence; that means it goes on for too long without the proper punctuation.  To fix it, you&#39;ll need to cut it up into smaller sentences and add the right punctuation.  Let&#39;s start at the beginning.<br><br>&quot;I read a lot of the mission things and they were funny...&quot;<br><br>For starters, I&#39;d put a period right after &quot;things.&quot;  You&#39;ve said what you needed, so don&#39;t go overboard.  That sentence stands on its own.  Eliminate the &quot;and,&quot; and you get:<br><br>&quot;I read a lot of the mission things.  They were funny...&quot;<br><br>Doesn&#39;t that look better?  Now for the next sentence:<br><br>&quot;They were funny but it kind of hurt to realize you thought my story was that bad but I got over it...&quot;<br><br>This requires a bit more work.  Put a comma between &quot;funny&quot; and &quot;but,&quot; because &quot;They were funny&quot; and &quot;but it kind of hurt...&quot; are completely different ideas in the sentence, and you need to separate them.  Put a period after &quot;bad,&quot; because the sentence is pretty much complete after two ideas are introduced.  So:<br><br>&quot;They were funny, but it kind of hurt to realize that you guys thought my story was that bad.  But I got over it...&quot;<br><br>Next: &quot;But I got over it and now I&#39;m hoping you guys can help me write better because I don&#39;t want that to happen again.&quot;<br><br>Put a comma between &quot;it&quot; and &quot;and,&quot; to separate those two ideas.  Then, put a comma between &quot;better&quot; and &quot;because.&quot;  Once that is out of the way, say &quot;I don&#39;t want to get sporked again&quot; instead of &quot;I don&#39;t want that to happen again.&quot;  That eliminates the need for the next sentence, which makes things a lot simpler.  A general rule of thumb: the simpler things are, the better.<br><br>&quot;But I got over it, and now I&#39;m hoping you guys can help me write better, because I don&#39;t want to get sporked again.&quot;<br><br>And the final complete product:  &quot;I read a lot of the mission things.  They werefunny, but it kind of hurt to realize that you guys thought my story was that bad.  But I got over it, and now I&#39;m hoping you guys can help me write better, because I don&#39;t want to get sporked again.&quot;<br><br>There!  That&#39;s much better.  Incidentally, this is how *I* would revise this sentence.  Others on the board may tell you differently, because there are many different ways you could fix this and still be correct.<br><br>So, there you have it, you need to work mostly on your punctuation and sentence structure.<br><br>Now, I didn&#39;t give you any advice on subtler problems, like characterization and plot plausibility.  To do that, I&#39;d need to read your actual story...but I wouldn&#39;t recommend you talk to me about that.  I&#39;m not familiar with Beka Cooper, so I wouldn&#39;t be much help there.  However, I&#39;m sure that someone here is, and you can link them to your story and have them give you some advice.<br><br>All in all, I&#39;m glad you&#39;ve continued writing after having some hurt feelings.  You&#39;re doing a good job so far.  Keep it up, and take help whenever it&#39;s offered, and you&#39;ll be writing like a pro.<br><br>Good luck.</p>

            <p>Mapping the Suvian genome... that&#39;s ambitious!<br><br>Now I&#39;m wondering about heritability. Most Sues don&#39;t reproduce, so it would be hard to track, but it would be interesting to see which Sue traits are dominant, which are recessive, which show co-dominance, which are autosomal vs. sex-based, etc. And there would have to be mitigating factors that humans don&#39;t have, of course, since we all know how cooperative Sues are with the rules of biology.

            <p>I was planning to do a whole report on Suvian genetics, reproduction, anatomy, and lifecycle once I&#39;d got up the nerve and time to ask for Permission.<br><br>(If you <i>must</i> know, the Sue was going to actually be the larval form of the Plotbunny.

Glitter would be, not mica-based, but a carbon-unobtainium aromatic ring, in two forms.

            <p>I seem to have unleashed a monster...<br><br>Judging from the way the affect canons, though, I&#39;d say that &#39;Sue traits act more like a kind of virus, jumping from character to character. For actual &#39;Sues who reproduce (there are a few, I believe. Rape victim! &#39;Sues, probably.), that would be very interesting to look at. Of course, we would need both mother and child. Maybe someone should send out a general anouncement that we need pregnant &#39;Sues brought in either alive or in pieces, preferably with the uterus intact. Though for those impregnated by canon characters, it might be hard to separate &#39;Sue characteristics from posession &#39;Sue ones.

            <p>Granted, the oddity of the mpreg reproductive method may present additional hurdles for the scientist (one of which hurdles is bound to be the inadequate supply of bleeprin); however, the existence of mpreg does increase the probability that sufficient data can be gathered on parent/child pairs.<br><br>Though it is admittedly ethically dubious, examining the Possession Sue may also be a potential source of data, as canon characters tend to become pregnant more often than Mary Sues. It may only be practical in those cases where the Sue has actually replaced the canon character, rather than the cases where simple possession still allows exorcism and return of the canon character to his native habitat.<br><br>Due to the rarity of Mary Sue reproduction by pregnancy and birth, I agree that we may unfortunately be forced to rely on case studies rather than being able to collect enough data for proper statistical analysis.</p>

Viruses also play a role in transferring genes from one organism to another, especially for little one-celled organisms that just divide instead of swapping genes through sexual reproduction.<br><br>Disclaimer: I am in biomedical engineering, not genetics or virology.

            <p>It&#39;s always great to finish something, and though I didn&#39;t have time to read it slowly, I enjoyed it. <br><br>Your agents remind me of bickering five-year-olds, but they&#39;re charming, in their own way. The contrast between the bickering and the precision of the lab reports is also amusing, in a PPCish style. <br><br>(Also, your sulking consoles made me think - what if the sentient consoles talk to each other? What would a story be like from <i>their</i> point of view? Actually, one could make the same case for all equipment, like the CADs and the semi-sentient scanners - that was very funny, by the way. Hmmm...)<br><br>I only have a few criticisms. Ons is that you have numbers written as numerals instead of words, like here - <i>“Right. So we need 9 categories.”</i> Also, in the paragraph beginning, &quot;<i>When she had finished her initial observations</i>&quot;, you start far too many sentences with the word &quot;she&quot;; try to vary it a little.<br><br>Last - Mr Mistoffelees! Ah, what a good song to sing. I like that song. Just had to mention it ;)</p>

            <p>So glad you liked it! The bickering five-year-old effect is the one I was going for, so it&#39;s good that you picked up on it. And I&#39;ve always thought that the personalities of agents conficlicted greatly with their jobs, so exaggerating that was fun.<br><br>Ooh, I hadn&#39;t thought of that. That would indeed be funny. Especially for CADs and things, which go on missions with the agents.<br><br>Thanks for pointing those things out.

            <p>I haven&#39;t read a DoMSEaR (not necessarily the correct formatting—I just like how that method looks) story before. Yours is wonderful. Can I claim the male agent that Cocoa almost ran into? It might be a while until I write the scene in, but I enjoy interlinked stories.<br><br>I noticed a few things that you might want to change. As your agents are walking to the table, the word <q>habit</q> seems overused. In the same paragraph, I think the phrase <q>...falling into step out with her sister of habit...</q> should be <q>...falling into step with her sister <i>out</i> of habit...</q>. After Cocoa writes the first part of the report, <q>9</q> should be spelled out. In the third paragraph of <q>Analysis and Conclusion of Results</q>, you say that <q>Suethors have little to know actual grasp of biology.</q> That <q>know</q> should probably be a <q>no</q>. Finally, watch your spaces. They seemed to double (<q>  </q> instead of <q> </q>) a couple times.<br><br>If the strange table formatting is the content extending to the borders, change the <q>cellpadding</q> CSS variable (eg. &lt;table cellpadding=&quot;2px&quot;&gt;). You might want to work with the <q>width</q> variable as well, both in the main table tag and in at least one td tag per column. Also in the coding, yet otherwise unrelated to the table, your footnote links should be switched—they currently point to themselves.<br><br>Sorry about that. I occasionally get into a listing mood. I actually enjoyed your work a lot!</p>

            <p>So glad you liked it! I think there&#39;s all of one other out there, so it&#39;s not unusual for people not to have read them.

            <p>I also have a quick beta request for anyone interested. Earlier, being in a strange mood, I went over to DeviantArt to find a picture to help me become inspired. I found one, and proceeded to write this piece (found here, since I&#39;m failing at coding today: <a href="http://anamiascorner.webs.com/loyalty.htm"><a href="http://anamiascorner.webs.com/loyalty.htm">http://anamiascorner.webs.com/loyalty.htm</a></a>), and I would be delighted to get someone&#39;s opinion. Mostly, what I would like to know is whether it&#39;s worth going over some more and polishing, or, in other words, whether it makes any kind of sense to anyone else. Pointing out any grammatical and/or spelling errors would also be lovely.<br><br>Thank you in advance,<br>--anamia</p>

            <p>Er, well, it sort of depends on what you want the information for. It doesn&#39;t come up that often in missions except as passing mentions, and as far as writing things set there I&#39;m pretty sure Neshomeh&#39;s claimed it as her preserve, so I think you&#39;d want to take queries up with her.*<br><br>Other than that, you&#39;re probably good with what&#39;s already out there.<br><br>*If I&#39;m wrong, anyone who knows so is free to thwap me with a herring and point it out.</p>

            <p>They probably can&#39;t take every bit character that comes in, &#39;cause they&#39;d be swamped, but if the recruit can&#39;t function properly without intercession, then yeah. Like all PPC &quot;training,&quot; though, it can be somewhat hit and miss. It probably depends on whether the agents bringing in the recruits think to take them there, too.

            <p>You know the drill.<br><br>1. Would someone from another continua be able to function at all, yet alone live in a completely different one, for example World One? (I&#39;m assuming, nastily enough, that most agents would die instantly if they entered World One without a disguise, and I&#39;m assuming THIS because someone said Suethors, and probably quite a few authors/creators don&#39;t know much about biology.)<br><br>2. People fall into HQ through plotholes all the time, right? What&#39;s the usual response from someone who does this? (I&#39;m expecting that most aren&#39;t going to be able to accept the existence of fictional characters, and probably go more than absolutely bonkers because of it, as compared to someone a little more fantastical/disconnected with reality/imaginative, who might not break from it.)<br><br>3. I&#39;ve been experimenting with an interesting concept with two agents. One&#39;s an aspiring, overimaginative writer who has written some fanfiction or something in his spare time, and the other is one of his creations, taken from the fanfic some time before its creator entered HQ. Would this be allowed in my writing, or should I scrap it altogether? (In my opinion, it has an insane amount of potential for all kinds of hilarious things and other stuff.)<br><br>There&#39;s some more, but I can&#39;t really remember them right now. In the mean time, have some music: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDE1VcuBi6o"><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDE1VcuBi6o">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDE1VcuBi6o</a></a></p>

            <p>Yeah. These questions are a bit more sinister in terms of what they&#39;re asking. Nasty stuff.<br><br>4. Is HQ affected by the words, much like other continua? (heheheh)<br><br>5. If someone&#39;s badfic was PPC&#39;d and they were aware of it (yet not angry enough to baaaawwww about it) could they potentially write something to reverse the mission, or god forbid, kill the agents? (Yeah, this one&#39;s kinda nasty...)<br><br>6. Is there any real explanation to why when agents die, they can&#39;t be resurrected? (My guess is that their &quot;words&quot; are rendered inert or almost inert after their death. Perhaps a disadvantage to being somewhat independent/seperate from their creator?)<br><br><br>7. Related to the above, is it possible that they <i>just might </i> be able to be ressurrected, given the right circumstances, like the kind of death mentioned in question 5? (As in a death without their creator&#39;s permission. This kind of makes sense, as sues come back sometimes after agents kill them)<br><br>8. Someone (Sedri, I believe) answered one of the questions in one of my older question threads implying that agents are more independent than the normal word construct. Just how much of this idea has been explored in-universe? (Ooh, might not want to ask this one... Opening up a whole can of worms with this one)<br><br>I needed to ask these ones before I started using the general concepts and such involving them in my writing. Expect more later.<br></p>

<li>Despite the fact that HQ is connected to a bunch of other continua, it is a continuum itself and can be changed. I think Neshomeh might&#39;ve mentioned Fanfiction Land and the Creativity Shield, which are the current solutions to the problem--a way to deflect any changes before they can cause problems.<br><br>Bad Things can happen when PPC badfic gets around the shield. Case in point:<br><a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Jaycacia_Thornbyrd"><a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Jaycacia_Thornbyrd">http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Jaycacia_Thornbyrd</a></a><br><br>Don&#39;t blame me if you get neuralyzed:<br><a href="http://www.freewebs.com/bonsaimallorn4/DIOEntrance.htm"><a href="http://www.freewebs.com/bonsaimallorn4/DIOEntrance.htm">http://www.freewebs.com/bonsaimallorn4/DIOEntrance.htm</a></a><br><br>5. Yes, but they&#39;d have to get around existing protection first. (I don&#39;t think it&#39;s nasty, incidentally. Plenty of writers have killed off their Agents. It gives the surviving partner plenty of reason to get homicidal, which is always fun.)<br><br>6. I think it&#39;s possible to resurrect an Agent. However, the PPC exists to protect the continua, not to keep its Agents either alive or sane. I&#39;ve not yet found the reason; so I&#39;ll speculate: <br><br>Resurrecting people willy-nilly tends to tempt the laws of Plot in general; and before you know it, you end up with a zombie/vampire/whatnot apocalypse. Resurrecting canon characters doesn&#39;t cause that problem because when they return to their home continua, their home canon takes hold of them and they behave as though they were never resurrected. With Agents, though, you the run the risk of something going Horribly Wrong. Most likely, they simply don&#39;t want to run the risk. Legal probably enforces it.<br><br>Even if it went perfectly all of the time, with enough badfic exposure, Agents who lived long enough would inevitably go insane, and I don&#39;t think anybody wants an HQ full of homicidally insane immortal Agents.<br><br>The average Agent lasts maybe a year or two. That&#39;s about it. After that, anybody who hasn&#39;t managed to get just insane enough to deal with it, without going outright flamethrower-crazy, is either dead, insane, or retired.<br><br>This is probably part of why PPC agents get so snarky and cynical after a while. It&#39;s self-defense. Ever watched M*A*S*H? It&#39;s like that--lots of humor helps to deal with the crazy.</li>

<li>Absolutely. That&#39;s why <a href="http://www.freewebs.com/fanfic_land/Page1.htm">Fanfic Land</a> has a Creativity Shield to prevent leakage, and why we have the <a href="http://www.freewebs.com/bonsaimallorn4/DIOEntrance.htm"><s>DIO</s></a>Happy Bunnies and Sunshine.<br><br>5. Potentially. Speaking ex-universe, it&#39;s never happened to my knowledge, and we would probably just MST it, have a laugh, and move on if it did. In-universe, however, someone using writing to attack agents would have to be very clever about it, since they&#39;d be going up against the will of the agents&#39; author(s) and the Legal Department. I don&#39;t think Legal would allow for an outside influence to go &quot;and then they died&quot; and have someone drop dead for no reason. It would have to be something that could actually happen to the agents.<br><br>6. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s so much that they CAN&#39;T be resurrected as that no one employed by HQ will do it for them. It&#39;s just Not Done. (Some people have gotten around this by turning into Time Lords. This is not an advised course of action. Plus, it would be kinda lame to copy-cat like that.)<br><br>7. I would think so, yes, since in that situation it would be tantamount to disrupting canon, and then it would be necessary to bring them back in order to restore canon.<br><br>8. It&#39;s been played with in that some agents are aware that they have authors, and all agents are aware that authors exist and that words can affect the multiverse. Most agents just don&#39;t think about it, which is good. Otherwise we&#39;d be up to our eyeballs in existential crises, and nothing would get done. It&#39;s all very meta, since at the end of the day, WE are the authors, and we decide what sees daylight and what doesn&#39;t, not them. *shrug*<br><br>~Neshomeh</li>

            <p>From the patterns I&#39;ve seen (and remember I&#39;m new, though unfortunately prone to lectures):<br><br>In any given continuum, things will follow the default rules of that continuum unless those rules are directly twisted by a &#39;Sue.<br><br>When the rules do get twisted, the continuum attempts to follow them as directly and literally as possible--which results in some rather odd effects, such as Mini creation.<br><br>When someone crosses from one continuum to another, he will generally still behave as though the new continuum were a part of his home continuum: Someone from the Harry Potter verse could still cast spells; a Vulcan could still perform a mind-meld. I can only assume that this means characters retain a connection to their home continuum. It doesn&#39;t make characters invulnerable to things that would hurt them in their home continua, though: A vampire from &quot;Dracula&quot; would still be vulnerable to a stake through the heart even in a place where vampires do not exist or are not vulnerable to stakes.<br><br>Those rules seem to hold true for characters from Sue-twisted continua. A Sue that enters HQ from her own world will still retain her Sue powers. Sue weaponry and magical artifacts still retain their qualities. (Most of the time, though, friendly resident ex-Sues and any Sueish possessions are deliberately depowered to avoid influencing agents.)<br><br>Characters from worlds that have been influenced by Sues seem to retain the Suefluence-related characteristics even after they travel to another world. That holds true even if the Sue is killed or the major aberration repaired, and their home continuum reverts to its original state. When the home continuum reverts, all canon characters still in the original continuum tend towards reverting to canon as well, though those who have had the most contact with the Sue will probably have to be neuralyzed. However, any characters on a different world at the time do not revert along with their home canon.<br><br>It is probably possible to transfer some of the effects of one&#39;s home continuum to someone else. Learning magic from a character recruited from the Harry Potter &#39;verse seems to be possible, for example; as is becoming a vampire if bitten by a vampire from any one of many places where vampires bite and turn people.<br><br>How does this apply to biology (other than my loving long lectures)? Well, basically, biology is just one more rule that a Mary Sue has the ability to alter. The rules of a home continuum--even one that has been altered by a Mary Sue--will imprint on anyone leaving that continuum, and work the same way for them afterward. That means that bad biology would most likely still work for anyone who traveled to World One--even for things that were obviously impossible, such as flying with wings much too small, or being an impossible hybrid with three parents.<br><br>Exceptions:<br>*There are reports of Agents assimilating into continua that aren&#39;t their original ones. They are no longer cloaked by the canon (as active Agents would be), but tend to retain some effects from their home worlds. Theoretically, if someone with biology impossible on one world were to move to another and stay there, it might eventually become either dangerous or deadly to stay, or simply become impossible to use whatever powers their original biology granted. (Possibly both, depending on the exact nature of the difference between the two biologies.)<br><br>*Some things tend to either blow up in your face, or at least stop working, if you question them too hard (I shan&#39;t mention bleeprin). Bad biology in a world that doesn&#39;t support it may be one of those things. While there are no recorded instances (that I&#39;ve found), pointing out the illogical nature of someone&#39;s biology, while in a world that does not support said biology, may be enough to cause the current world&#39;s rules to assert themselves... possibly in a very messy and satisfying manner. Think of it as a more scientific version of &quot;I don&#39;t believe in fairies.&quot;</p>

            <p>...I recall seeing a pair like that once upon a time, I think. I could be imagining things, but I&#39;m pretty sure there&#39;s precedent. I&#39;ll do some looking.<br><br>As to question one, my personal take is that since Agents function fine in other continua, and Agents recruited from fic function just fine in different continua, that unless there&#39;s something explicitly very wrong with the biology, i.e. incompatible atmospheres, everyone should be fine.<br><br>And, uh, as to two, it&#39;s not that bad. Most of &#39;em find a place and cope. The others get shuffled off home quickly. Again, my take is that usually totally unsuitable, closed-minded people don&#39;t usually find the plotholes because they don&#39;t have the conception that such thing could exist.</p>

            <p>I don&#39;t know much more than you do, but here is what I think for each of your questions.<br><br><ol>
<li>It depends on the continua involved. Assuming similar atmospheres, the character should only suffer minor discomfort when moving to a different Word World. In World One, anyone who can pass through the Reality Room should be fine. I imagine that, just as long as the writer doesn&#39;t actually <i>describe</i> bad biology, the character still defaults to functionally accurate. I hope so, anyway. I intend on having one of my agents repeatedly break the disguise generator.</li>
<br><li>Like you said, it depends on the temperament of the traveler. Randall (one of my agents) comes from a world where magic is common, and maybe a year or so before he fell into HQ, a lot of his perceptions of his world were broken (story coming eventually). For him, the PPC wasn&#39;t <i>too</i> strange of an adjustment, but it could definitely be bad for other people.</li>
<br><li>That sounds like it has a lot of great potential! I don&#39;t see why it wouldn&#39;t be allowed—repentant Suethors are not uncommon, and a large portion of the other agents are recruited from badfic. I can see the author getting confused a lot (“But you aren&#39;t supposed to like doing that!”, “You should be doing this a different way!”).</li>

<li>A <i>lot</i> of Agents (most self-inserts, for example) would be from World One or a similar world. I&#39;d expect that as long as the atmosphere of World One is similar enough to the Agent&#39;s home continuum they&#39;d be able to survive. Different gravities may make it hard for them (or cause some long-term bone problems), and there&#39;s always the potential for a War of the Worlds style &quot;oh no, the bacteria, they kill me!&quot;, but I guess Medical would be able to immunise against that.<br>Bad biology is bad biology, though. If the Agent could only exist in a highly-magical environment, or in very low gravity, entering World One may prove fatal, but YMMV.<br><br>2. Shock, insanity and craziness, one would assume. Whatever is the funniest (keeping in mind that the Laws of Comedy are more-or-less pre-eminent in HQ).<br><br>3. Agents can be recruited from basically any continuum, so I see no reason why you couldn&#39;t recruit and author AND a character from one of their fics. In a slightly-less canonical example, PPC Boarders and Agents have been known to socialise together (usually in the Shipfest or so on). I agree that this definitely has a lot of potential for hilarity to ensue.<br><br>Elcalion</li>

<li>Depends on the person, I believe. A lot of agents *come* from World 1, so that&#39;s no problem. And, personally, I work under the assumption that biology is correct until proven otherwise. It&#39;s when you get blatant biological aberrations that you have problems. For non-World 1 natives, it would depend on the species. If the original Canon has them visit World 1 (I&#39;m thinking Animorphs and such here), then I would think they&#39;d be fine. And most canons are at least partially based in World 1, since authors tend to be human. It would be harder, I think, for people to function in places other than World 1, but, again, I imagine it&#39;s more of a case-by-case thing.<br><br>2. Speaking for my own agents, they accepted it more or less easily because, a) they were recruited by an agent who sort of explained it, b) they wanted to be there anyway, or c) they&#39;re bonkers anyway. I can&#39;t speak for anyone else, but I assume one of the qualities you want in an agent is the ability not to break.<br><br>3. Ooh, that sounds really fun. Especially if the character is mad at the author for putting him/her/it through some kind of hell. -evil laugh- If you don&#39;t end up doing so, I think I might.<br><br>--anamia</li>

            <p>Combining the aforementioned spice, a concoction meant for eye surgery and a wee bit of scumble, my fevered brain has concoccted a proposed sequel for the Film interpretation of the Hitchikers&#39; Guide to the Galaxy movie.<br><br>(I read the first book and have the movie and i expect to be laughed at... I welcome it, but here at least you people will understand my rambling)<br><br>The Title:  (Mostly) Harmless.  Where the book is regarded in some circles as Adam&#39;s most depressing work, the movie version is... depressing, but more for the video record of a young woman grating at her own nerves in imprisonment.<br><br>The Main Character is one Ramdom Frequent Flyer Dent.  As in the book, she is the biological daughter of one Authur Dent and one Tricia Macmillan.  Unlike in the book (as far as I can tell), she has been raised by both in a four-and-a-half parent household aboard the Hart of Gold (two parents who never quite got into the whole &quot;wedded&quot; thing, two Betelguese-ian &quot;uncles&quot; and an android nanny who occasionally got his vocabulator shut off to keep Random from crying).  <br><br>Now, at 16 years, 4 months, 25 days (and pocket change) old... she&#39;s in the tanty.  A super-secret, M15-run, white-corridored tanty deep underneath her fathers hometown.  But for her, it&#39;s an alien world.., she even did the whole &quot;I come in peace&quot; schtick by landing in a very public place in a mid-range shuttlecraft.  Almost immedatiatly it got called a hoax (if not performance art) in all the papers.   <br><br>What started as a &quot;simple&quot; joyride is now leading to her recording a daily video-diary on her wristwatch (on such diverse subjects as the evolution of the Vogon bureaucracy and the ultimate question)... while spending the days in her cell between examinations, interviews, interrogations and her entertainment mandated by the Geneva Convention (whatever the heck that is).<br><br>Meanwhile, her parents are just finally beginning worry about where she is... and where she took Fenchurch, the (government property)AI that she loaded into her shuttle&#39;s computer.<br><br>(tunes out for a minute and then back it)<br><br>Could someone check my eye colour... and I swear that my mouth feels and tastes like the inside of a cinnamon grinder.</p>

            <p>Hi, everyone!<br><br>If my name is annoying to write, feel free to shorten it to MM (then again, you were probably going to do that anyway, huh?)<br><br>Like the post subjects says, I&#39;m new. I heard about the PPC from TvTropes, and maybe someday I&#39;ll start writing my own, but I don&#39;t think I know quite enough to do so quite yet. I&#39;m maybe a third of the way through the Original Series, though, so I&#39;m getting there.<br><br>A little about me... I love reading video game fanfics, mostly, because being in college I don&#39;t get to do much reading outside of what I do for class. Yes, I do read slashfics a lot, but bad ones annoy me just as much as anyone else. Doesn&#39;t help that I&#39;m gay and tons of bad slashfics are gay ones... ugh. Maybe if I do start writing I&#39;ll have my Agent be part of the Department of Bad Slash.<br><br>I&#39;ll probably be here for the next two weeks obsessively reading as many PPC storis as I can... because that&#39;s just what I do. I go into Panic Mode and read as much as I can. Can&#39;t wait to make some new frinds and entertain myself with some good reading!</p>

            <p>Hmmmmm... generally any Final Fantasy ones, though usually the later installments (VII+) because I&#39;m not as familiar with the early ones. There are precious few fanfics for MMOs (other than WOW, of course, which I don&#39;t play). Aion and EVE would be nice.<br><br>Baten Kaitos is good, as is Jak &amp; Daxter (though these two are hard as well).<br><br>In general, I play mostly RPGs and platformers, so I read mostly RPGs and platformers, heh.</p>

            <p>You poor thing, it is horrible dealing with the illness of someone you are close to.<br><br>As the other posters have said, the best thing you can do is to be there, for him, and for your parents. Little things, like going to see someone when they are feeling unwell help enormously. <br><br>It sounds to me like this is affecting you quite deeply, make sure you talk to people about it. Keeping stuff bottled up will do you no good at all. <br><br>Cancer is an odd disease, every cancer is a little bit different, and what works to cure one person may have no effect on another. Sadly there is no magical cure, especially for Pancreatic Cancer which has a high mortality and a low 5 year survival rate. I know that this is not what you want to hear, but never give up hope, there are people who beat the disease, and live for many years after being told that they only have a short time to live.<br><br>My heart goes out to you!</p>

            <p>Being in the hospital is one of the most tedious and unfamiliar things that can ever happen to somebody. If your friend is in the hospital (and most likely he will repeatedly be in the hospital), he&#39;s most likely going to be bored out of his skull, feeling more than a bit helpless, and generally uncomfortable.<br><br>I&#39;ve been in the hospital (my longest time was only ten days, though), and I can tell you that when that happens, if you&#39;re even awake to see they&#39;re there, visitors are simply a lifesaver. They bring a bit of normality with them that seems to relieve the artificial environment of a hospital. The most annoying part of the whole experience is that you feel like you&#39;ve lost control of your own life. Even the little things--like having your own comforter from your own bed--can make it a little more bearable. The most encouraging thing, I found, was to have people who simply treated me as a human being rather than a collection of symptoms (as the medical people so often did).<br><br>Most likely your friend will have times when he feels better, and times when he&#39;s able to come home and live pretty much normally (though probably he&#39;ll become tired a lot more easily). That&#39;s part of the point of cancer treatment--to increase quality of life, so that he can go about his business as unhindered by his illness as possible. Many people who live with cancer don&#39;t particularly want to put their lives on hold for it; so they learn that they can adjust things, get some help or get more creative (or both), and find ways to do what they want to do. People, in general, are rather resilient that way. An older lady in my church has been dealing with cancer for maybe five years; and she&#39;s pretty much the same as she&#39;s always been, except that she uses one of those powered scooters now so she won&#39;t get too exhausted.<br><br>Unfortunately, pancreatic cancer is one of the toughest types for modern medicine to deal with. Most likely your friend knows this already. But yes, people do occasionally recover even when doctors say they won&#39;t; and it&#39;s almost routine to hear of someone who gets five or even ten years when the doctors said he had only one. The human body is an amazingly complex system that we don&#39;t know everything about; and it&#39;s surprisingly good at returning to normal functioning even after something throws it way out of balance. I guess the bottom line is--it&#39;s a serious disease, so try not to fall into denial; but totally giving up hope isn&#39;t that logical either.</p>

            <p>to post this, that is. We try to be about more than just badfic sporking around here, after all.<br><br>It&#39;s really hard dealing when friends and relatives are sick, and it&#39;s perfectly normal to be upset about it.<br><br>I&#39;m not a doctor or anything like that, but it&#39;s not unknown for cancers to go into remission, sometimes for reasons which baffle doctors. You can definitely keep on hoping for that, and who knows? Sometimes people survive much longer than the doctors predict - the human body is still full of many mysteries that science and medicine can&#39;t completely understand.<br><br>But equally, I think you should be prepared for the prospect of losing your friend. Sometimes the doctors are right, and there is simply nothing more that they can do. Be hopeful, but recognise that sometimes it is time for a person to go, and as truly heartbreaking as that is, it is a part of this messed-up world.<br><br>If my experiences are anything to go by, I&#39;d recommend spending lots of time with your friend, and try to just be grateful/happy for having known him and all the things that he means to you, and let him know how loved and appreciated he is.<br><br>Being there, talking and listening to him, remembering the good things about their life - it could be really comforting for your friend to be able to talk to you and to have someone interesting in hearing his life stories, and being there to talk about those big questions - like what&#39;s the meaning of life, and whether there&#39;s anything beyond death.<br><br>And I&#39;d really, really urge you to say anything you have to say sooner rather than later. Don&#39;t put off things to later, cause you may never get another chance to say them - when my grandfather and  grandmother died recently, I was so grateful that I was able to see both of them in their final few days and basically say goodbye, and be able to sit there and remember all the good times and all that they&#39;d meant to me, rather than regretting that I&#39;d never had the chance to say goodbye one last time.<br><br>Don&#39;t be afraid to ask questions here on the Board, or just talk or vent or rant if you need to. Behind all the silliness, we&#39;re a community, and I&#39;m sure if you need to talk some more there&#39;ll be heaps of people here to listen, and that we&#39;ll be thinking of you.<br><br>Elcalion<br></p>

            <p>A lot depends on the type of cancer, at what stage it was discovered, how well a patient responds to treatment, etc. A prognosis of a year, I don&#39;t know, but that actually sounds pretty good. Sometimes I think cancer prognosises are like the weather: the further into the future the more uncertain the prediction is (perhaps one year turns out to be five?)<br><br>I&#39;m not an expert on cancer. Not being an oncologist. On a personal level, about half the people I know who had cancer survived. My aunt had pancreatic cancer; she was actually doing quite well, until she was also diagnosed with lung cancer.<br><br>That story is probably not very encouraging for you, but I also don&#39;t want to give you false hope; despite continuing progress in medicine still a lot of people die of cancer.<br><br>I think you can help your friend by asking him what you can do for him. And keep being his friend. Apart from the illness most people with cancer (or other serious illnesses or disabilities) suffer most from the fact that their friends stop visiting them.</p>

            <p>What&#39;s on the inside of a plothole? Jay and Acacia went inside one in the OS, but there isn&#39;t a very detailed description of what it&#39;s like in there. Is there any canon associated with this, or anything that would prevent me from making some up?<br><br>*crosses fingers*</p>

            <p>Many of the plot holes I&#39;ve heard talked about didn&#39;t have any volume to speak of--they simply led from one place to another, connecting those two places without actually creating any extra space for the plothole itself.<br><br>It could be that plot holes which &quot;contain&quot; things may simply be plot holes that link to a space that does contain those things (and which may or may not be created along with the plot hole). There&#39;s lots of precedent for various places and objects being created out of nothing; a plot hole leading to a space that&#39;s been created by a fic probably wouldn&#39;t be out of the realm of the possible.<br><br>So plot holes may not be &quot;holes&quot; like the kind you might dig in the ground at all; they may be more like portals.</p>

            <p>Some of them are like conduits--they allow for characters to have things they shouldn&#39;t have, or get to places they shouldn&#39;t be. This is the type that HQ has adapted and stabilized to connect the various parts of itself and to make portals <br><br>Others, like the ones canon characters end up inside when they get replaced, are just random pockets of misplaced space-time. This type is occasionally harnessed, as in the case of hammer-space/mace-space, Bags of Holding, etc. Generally I would think there&#39;s nothing inside except what someone puts there. There might not even be breathable air unless there&#39;s an open way in--but then again, there might be.<br><br>That&#39;s my two cents.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Given that most badly-described or inconsistent things in badfic default to Generic whatever.<br><br>Plus HQ harnesses plotholes as part of its architecture, so perhaps the Generic Surface is the result of the plotholes?<br><br>That said, they&#39;re plotholes, and governed by the Laws of Comedy and so if you need a plothole to be something for the purposes of a joke, I think that would be fine.</p>
