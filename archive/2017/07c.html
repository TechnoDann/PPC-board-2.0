            <p>Well, that was... completely ludicrous. On the plus side, Spider!Shelob is pretty scary. She has a nice angular shape which looks much more intrinsically menacing than the standard bulbous one.<br><br>On the minus side... everything else.<br><br>... I have to preemptively correct myself here. I was all ready to say that Ungoliant absolutely couldn&#39;t change hershape, but then I went to the source text in the Silm. Here&#39;s the introduction of the Unlight herself:<br><br><i>The Eldar knew not whence she came; but some have said that in ages long before she descended from the darkness that lies about Arda, when Melkor first looked down in envy upon the Kingdom of Manwë, and that in the beginning she was one of those that he corrupted to his service. But she had disowned her Master, desiring to be mistress of her own lust, taking all things to herself to feed her emptiness; and she fled to the south, escaping the assaults of the Valar and the hunters of Oromë, for their vigilance had ever been to the north, and the south was long unheeded. Thence she had crept towards the light of the Blessed Realm; for she hungered for light and hated it.<br><br>In a ravine she lived, and took shape as a spider of monstrous form, weaving her black webs in a cleft of the mountains. There she sucked up all light that she could find, and spun it forth again in dark nets of strangling gloom, until no light more could come to her abode; and she was famished.</i><br><br>So. Ungoliant isn&#39;t a Maia - she&#39;s said (by Tolkien, here, so we have to take it as canon) to have come down before Melkor - which means before <i>any</i> of the Valar. That places her in a special category with Tom &#39;before the Dark Lord came from outside&#39; Bombadil, so very select company.<br><br>But... yes, it seems that Ungoliant could explicitly and canonically change shape. Can that be inherited? The <i>mearas</i> seem to have gotten some traits from their potential forefather Nahar, steed of Orome; Huan is clearly more than just a big dog, despite being born as a puppy; and Luthien the Nightingale had enough power to bind Melkor himself in sleep, which must(?) have come from her mother, who once lived in the gardens of Irmo Lorien. So tentatively, <b>yes</b>, it&#39;s possible for &#39;divine&#39; traits to be passed down to children, and that could include shapeshifting.<br><br>I really don&#39;t like saying that. &gt;(<br><br>Fortunately, I get to agree with Nesh on the other part: there is absolutely no way Ungoliant or her spawn were gifted with Sight of any kind. Ungoliant got whipped by Balrogs for lack of it; Shelob got stabbed by a midget. Forward planning was never their thing. And, yes, it goes directly against their whole theme: even Manwe&#39;s Sight couldn&#39;t see through the Unlight of Ungoliant, and that sort of thing always goes both ways (witness Frodo&#39;s troubles with being spotted by Sauron in the Mirror of Galadriel, or with Amon Hen - and the bi-directionality of the <i>palantiri</i>).<br><br>Nesh is right that Ungoliant and Shelob are Tolkien&#39;s embodiments of Hunger. They may help others, but only for direct personal gain. Since Shelob clearly doesn&#39;t have her mother&#39;s light-eating abilities (Ungoliant lusted for the Silmarils, while Shelob runs from the trapped essence of the distant light of one of them), that means food. Of course, Talion and Celebrimbor don&#39;t look especially edible...<br><br>There&#39;s a couple of other things in the trailer that make me even more :O (in a bad way). It seems that Minas Ithil is a Gondorian fortress at this point - you know, the one that&#39;s been the Tower of Sorcery for thousands of years? Yeah, that one. Timeline hypercompression is in full swing. But let&#39;s ignore that! We have something else to attend to:<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/CfxRQOE.png"><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/C0DexKC.png"><br><br>This is either Celebrimbor (from his appearance) or Sauron (from the fact that he shows up over the line &#39;The Great Deceiver will pay for his betrayal&#39;). Of course, Shelob claims the two of them &#39;are one&#39;, so depending on how literal she&#39;s being, that might not even be a sensible question.<br><br>Either way, whoever it was hung out with Shelob... and is certainly implied to be offering her that three-stoned Ring. Which... could be anything. It&#39;s not one of the Movieverse Three or Seven, and obviously isn&#39;t the One or Brim&#39;s Other One, but after that...<br><br>My best guess is that it&#39;s either one of the Nine, or a lesser ring. Whether it&#39;s being offered to Shelob as a bribe in the present or the past, I don&#39;t know.<br><br>Oh, and speaking of Rings... guess what Shelob got hold of:<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/hDcm0kb.png"><br><br>That&#39;s Brim&#39;s Ring on her finger. We get a few good looks at it throughout the trailer, and I remember that it&#39;s inscribed in English using a Tengwar font (not English <i>in Tengwar</i>, you understand, but English keymappings with Tengwar letters)... I wonder if I can get more of the inscription off.<br><br>I thought I couldn&#39;t. &#39;r-e-j&#39;, it read, and I slumped. Then a couple of letters letter I had a capital I, so clearly it was just gibberish now. Nevertheless, I persevered to the end of the word, flicked the font from Tengwar to English, and saw:<br><br>&#39;rejoice.&#39;<br><br>... okay then! Let&#39;s do this.<br><br>Here&#39;s what I&#39;ve been able to read. Unlike the first trailer, we get a good look at both the inner and outer inscription, so:<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/YhhNEKA.png"><br><br>Which you can type into your preferred Tengwar font and read as:<br><br>Outer: You [...] light undiminished, All shall fear me and rejoice.<br><br>Inner: I renounce the Blessed Realm. To redeem the Land of Shadow.<br><br>Things to note:<br><br>-Yes, that&#39;s a misquote/inversion of Galadriel there on the outside.<br>-This is a seriously messed-up message, with Celebrimbor basically refusing to go to Heaven in order to... mind-control some orcs or something.<br>-I filled in parts of the latter half of the inner message from the previous trailer (this version shows &#39;to red... adow&#39;, so I&#39;m preeetty confident). Which means...<br>-<a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=305877;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">They&#39;ve reversed the Ring from last time!</a> You can&#39;t see the image any more (PHOTOBUCKET! [Shakes fist]), but you can watch the original trailer yourself and see portions of that &#39;inner&#39; text on the outside of the One More Ring. That&#39;s... I don&#39;t even know why you&#39;d do that.<br><br>The tagline at the end of the trailer is &#39;Nothing will be forgotten&#39;. Between Shelob, Minas Ithil, and now getting their <i>own Ring</i> inside out... I tend to doubt that. ;)<br><br>hS<br><br>PS: Is it bad that I kiiiiiind of want to write the story of Bombadil and Ungoliant fighting it out on Arda before the Valar arrive? She&#39;s the Dark Before the Stars, he&#39;s the Song of the Earth... it could work!</p>

            <p>So.<br><br>Okay.<br><br>I think I see what they&#39;re trying to do? Shelob in this is like the anti-Galadriel. Which is. Kinda cool, I guess. From a thematic point of view. Or something.<br><br>And, okay, there might be some sort of logic train that goes Ungoliant = Maia, so therefore her children = Maiar, and Maiar wear fleshly forms like clothing, so therefore they can change them like you&#39;d change your shirt.<br><br>But. Uh. We never see any of them actually do that in canon, except maybe Sauron the Deceiver.<br><br>And seriously, did we read the same books? As I recall, Shelob&#39;s main character trait was hunger, and she lived in near-total darkness, fearing the light, so where they&#39;re pulling this Sight thing from, I don&#39;t like to contemplate.<br><br>Eru save us from ever having to PPC a Sexy!Shelob fic. &gt;.&lt;<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I like it. I honestly like it. Extremely much. So much that I do not talk to my closest allies often because they go watch rerun of Naruto and Boruto, Bleach, and patiently watch One Piece, while I wonder when Vinland Saga will ever get their anime adaptation.<br><br>However, having a &#39;less gritty somewhat comedy period drama&#39; should be an explored genre. Where&#39;s the show of Venetian bankers trying to make that absentee landlord pays his bank dues? What about the daily troubles of trying to run a commedie del arte shows while touring through Europe? What about Buginese &#39;pirates&#39; trying to escape the clutches of Dutch taxes? Or, some sports, such as a knight trying to win tournaments? We have a movie about that, but come on, it&#39;s been a long time.<br><br></p>

            <p>I have only read the first chapter but I have a couple of things to point out. This is purely my opinion and others may say it&#39;s not a problem.<br><br>First of all, I can&#39;t get a grasp of where Kagami got his weapons. You mentioned he was close, but did he run back to where he stored his weapons? Or were they hidden behind the wall he was hiding behind? You left out some details regarding movement and location that makes some portions a bit confusing.<br><br>Second,the fight scenes are a bit choppy and reads like a pokemon battle. During the fight, you basically listed what was happening instead of giving a description, it also gave the impression of each persob taking turns performing an action. Unless that is what you are trying to go for, perhaps consider making it more fluid. A fight is a seamless sequence of actions and reactions. Maybe try and combine two actions into the same sentence, actions in a fight are rarely separate. Also some actions can be inferred. For example when Kagami used his spear to hit the bandit, instead of saying &quot;He stabs the bandit with his lance, which is stopped by the bandit’s round shield. The bandit is pushed back, but he calmly swings his mace to Kagami’s face.&quot; Perhaps do something like &quot;Kagami thrust at the bandit, the tip glancing off the bandit&#39;s raised shield. As the bandit stumbled, he planted his foot and retaliated, swinging his mace up towards Kagami&#39;s face. Kagami deflected the blow off his shield and was forced back by the momentum of the blow.&quot; The bandit raising his shield to block was implied by the lance hitting a shield. Doing this also combines the strike and block in the same instant instead of two separate moments. The same criticism also applies to the rest of the exposition, although it is less of a problem there. I also fall prey to this mistake, so you aren&#39;t alone in having to improve this.<br><br>Finally, this is a small problem and it probably won&#39;t bother most people. But during the scene where Kagami gets shot, the reaction timeframe is a bit off. Kagami saw the bandit pull back the bowstring, but he barely dodged the arrow. It seems like the arrow teleported or something. Unless it is actually a teleporting arrow, it might be better to change it to seeing the bandit let loose an arrow instead of drawing the bow. That gives a good timeframe to &quot;barely dodge&quot; because any self respecting warrior would start moving as soon as he or she notices a nocked arrow and thus it wouldn&#39;t be &quot;barely dodged&quot;.<br><br>So all in all, the story seems like a list of actions, events, and descriptions, instead of a fluid sequence. There are some location and movement details missing, and perhaps consider the timing of some of the action-reaction pairings then change the writing accordingly.<br></p>

            <p>I realise that I write it by the fight system in Mount and Blade: Warband. The system is closer to exchanging hits to one another, rather than attacking and defending in one move or a series of fluid movements, like how professional martial artists do. While I am writing based on the universe of M&amp;B, I already bend the world enough by using mods. And since I am doing world expanding, I will have to use reality rules.<br><br>I am busy rewriting the first chapter. When it is done, I will repost it.</p>

            <p>Usually a game&#39;s combat system is there to create an accessable way for players to fight. It is impossible to create a combat system that replicates the effect of real fights. Therefore I think that regardless of world expanding or whatnot, one should not think of a game&#39;s combat system as the way characters actually fight in universe, and instead think of it as simply a representation of what occured.</p>

            <p>one on one or fighting in small numbers.<br><br>But I will not extend the same conclusion to the battles later. Due to system limitations, M&amp;B often do not allow everyone to be on the field at once if their numbers are too large, they placed a limit on how many bodies can be rendered at one time. So there are waves of attacks, instead of only one setpiece battle. There are mods for enlarging the numbers beyond basegame allowance, but it makes my computer too slow. <br><br>Thus, there are tactics that employs this situation, such as rearranging your troop type to match the weakness of the enemy troop type. Or making the number of people on the battle field very small so you can solo them on your own if you are OP. I intend to capture that situation. After all, I am writing a realistic-ish M&amp;B and KnB crossover fanfic, not a low fantasy KnB fanfic.</p>

            <p>If that&#39;s how the large battles must be portrayed then it&#39;s fine to do so. Unfortunately, since i am not well versed in Mount and Blade, I won&#39;t be able to help much in terms of the larger scaled battles.

            <p>Sorry for taking so long, I have been very busy. Yoir writing improved quite  bit. I like the pacing, it&#39;s got a nice sort of continuous flow. The setting seems to be well defined without being too bogged down. All in all, a decent fanfic in my opinion, nothing fancy, but solid and enjoyable. Of course, there would always be stuff to improve, but try not to sweat it too much, it&#39;s just for fun after all.</p>

I&#39;ve been a long time writer and first started learning my trade on fanfiction, and it went from there. <br><br>If anyone wants to know what TripleDES means, my screen name is chosen after a now-obsolete symmetric cipher. Triple Data Encryption Standard was hastily implemented as an interim measure to bridge the gap between the older Data Encryption Standard and Advanced Encryption Standard.

            <p>I barely even know what half of this stuff is that you&#39;re talking about. But I want to learn. The techiest I am at this current moment is being an amateur ratio operator.

It is also programmable via an Arduino board! :D<br><br>Now for the less techy part. What fandoms and stuff are you in? What types of things do you like to write?

            <p>-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----<br>Hash: SHA512<br><br>Hi there,<br><br>Amateur radio is awesome, it&#39;s something I&#39;ve wanted to get into myself in the future. Not enough attention gets paid to the radio these days, makes me feel nostalgic. <br><br>I appreciate the robot! <br><br>I&#39;m a little cautious of the Internet: I just don&#39;t like giving away more to the open Internet than I absolutely need to. I might&#39;ve mentioned this over the chat, but when I give data away, I view it as something of a transaction, whether that transaction is communicating with someone, communicating with someone on another person&#39;s behalf, or saying something publicly to the rest of the world, and when I make that transaction I prefer it to be an informed, conscious choice, rather than accepting private enterprises and data giants hoarding our data and information so it can be monetized as just a fact of using the Internet. I&#39;d be happy to show you how the applications work if you&#39;re interested. <br><br>I do have plenty of characters that I&#39;ve used for role-playing, and for my own writing (which I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll discuss here), but for this I&#39;ll probably have to make new ones, since I want to keep my different lives on the internet separate. One of the things that actually fascinates me about fictional characters is that they&#39;re actually in some ways a huge reflection of ourselves, and a ton of our own hopes, dreams, our self-image and how we view ourselves. Whether we mean to or not, lots of our psychology ends up getting wrapped up in our own fictional characters. So when I read about other people&#39;s fictional characters and start analyzing them, in a way, I&#39;m reading about the people that write them, and the more naked their egos are in the stories they write, the easier it is to see through the story into the person writing it. Wish fulfilment characters actually are pretty fascinating because even if they&#39;re utterly disgusting to read about from an entertainment perspective, they&#39;re amazingly honest in terms of what they say about the person who&#39;s writing them. <br><br><br>At this moment I&#39;m on the fence about writing missions myself, since I&#39;m the type of person that prefers to build up, rather than punch down. If do write a PPC mission, it will be against my own Mary Sues that have never seen the judgement of the Internet and were written long ago, or ones I will write specially for the purpose of deconstructing them later. Best thing about that approach will be that it&#39;ll allow me to make them tailored to the kind of parody that I want to write, without needing to search through a lot of other people&#39;s badly written fanfiction to find something specific first. I think there are a lot of ways in which I could give back to the writing community besides that as well, although I&#39;ll have to stick around and see what you guys could use of my skills. <br><br>Two of my favourite continuities are Harry Potter and Star Wars, which have no shortage of fanfiction at all. I have other more esoteric favourites, but I&#39;ll let them come out as time goes on, or possibly over more private protocols. <br>-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----<br><br>iLUEARMKAB0WIQTfllUBtaeNnRzzfmVK3+74uImA+wUCWXa+pQAKCRBK3+74uImA<br>+315Af9H1jmmc7kyeEgxWxlagtvcDkzZ4XVr4pgnwbeRKc+MzhN5jsOk+7m1F6F1<br>3v5zaVGEXL1g6A5gOr4No2AI+eWuAfwO8JpTbfIBnwgLkijbvEzCO7tSXX5xq5TP<br>YNVNC/oWZr53Rx+vxe/0AyOjwIRcb2TCvB8EvR6zq6/ekouhesbv<br>=tw8/<br>-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----<br></p>

<li>It&#39;s a pretty cool hobby, and I especially love DXing (contacting folks outside your country) and SOTA (Summits on the Air). Despite being obscure, ham radio is very much alive.<br><br>2.

The fact that we get wrapped up in our characters period sorta ties into the human want to be part of something special.<br>e. It&#39;s even more obvious when the entire moral system is based around the characters. Then you&#39;ve got something similar to an Ideology Sue.<br><br>5. Oh huh! Never thought of it that way. I guess a good way to end a mission so that people don&#39;t get quite as mad would be something like adding a little list of the bad traits, then saying &quot;however&quot; and adding a little list of the good traits. By putting the good traits last, people will leave in a better mood than they would if you put the bad traits last. I also had the idea once to make up my own badfic for a PPC-ish story - may have to reassess whether or not I actually want to write that webcomic about two characters who do something similar to the PPC but aren&#39;t part of it.<br><br>-Twistey<br></li>

            <p>-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----<br>Hash: SHA512<br><br>That&#39;s fantastic! Someday, I&#39;ll have to get a Ham radio license. I&#39;m not in the most ideal position to do it at this moment, but I want to. When I do I&#39;ll have to see about building my own amplifier and my own equipment, since taking the DIY approach would be boss! Not sure if I would save any money by taking the homebrew route but it would be cool to do nonetheless. I think I would need to figure out where I could set up an antenna. <br><br>As for crypto, get ready for a bit of an infodump, I&#39;ll leave a bit of a primer below!<br><br>4 - Yeah, the main thing I realized is that the average fanfiction writer is probably at that awkward, transitory stage in their lives. As bad as the stuff they might churn out might be, it doesn&#39;t make me feel any better about myself picking on them, especially when making the mistakes you make the first time around as a writer and knowing and recognizing your old shames are what makes you grow up as a writer and improve. It&#39;s important to know when to deflate an ego and knock someone down a peg, but I don&#39;t feel right doing it to a thirteen year old behind their back and while anonymous, especially if it&#39;s in a fashion that could be construed as being mean-spirited. So that&#39;s probably why I&#39;ll be doing it to my own fanfiction, or writing my own grade of parody bad fanfiction. I can just imagine what my characters&#39; reaction would be to getting stuck in a story full of extremely dated pepperjack, and going &quot;This author likes plugging Will Smith? What is this, 1996? Someone shoot me before The Backstreet Boys show up.&quot; <br><br>5 - That&#39;s a pretty good idea, I very much like the idea of being positive. It&#39;s too easy on the Internet to be negative all the time and just spiral down into this cycle of hatred. That&#39;s not quite my style, so talking about what you liked rather than what you didn&#39;t is a great idea! <br><br><br>And now for the infodump... <br><br>PGP is one of the older and more feature-rich public key infrastructure systems, invented during the 1990s. A lot of people are familiar with using it for E-mail, but it&#39;s more than that. It is a system of public key infrastructure, so one key (the public key) encrypts and verifies, but it takes a different key (the private key) to decrypt and sign. You to put the public key in a place where everyone can get it, so they can encrypt to you or verify stuff that you&#39;ve cryptographically signed with your private key, but as long as only you have the private key, only you can ever sign or decrypt. This way, for instance, I don&#39;t have to go all the way across the internet to deliver a shared key or a password to you, as long as you know that the key belongs to me. To help you with that, each key has a unique identifier, called a &#39;fingerprint&#39; that can&#39;t be forged and is unique to that key. The rationale would be that you would hold a key signing party, and then get your friends to meet you, and both you and all your friends confirm that the key fingerprint belongs to you. This prevents what&#39;s called a &#39;man in the middle&#39; attack by an active attacker giving a fake key in place of the real ones, then impersonating both sides of a conversation to each other. Some people like to certify each other by building a network of verified people that they know and trust, and can personally visit in person as a defense against this, but I personally don&#39;t suggest doing this.  <br><br>A signature, or the &quot;begin signed message&quot; at the top and the jumble of seemingly random letters at the bottom is a code that can be verified to have only have been generated by my key. Should someone attempt to modify the message within &quot;signed message&quot; and &quot;end signature&quot; then what will likely happen is the verification will display &quot;Bad Signature&quot; or display an error. If that happens, then you will know immediately that someone has tried to tamper with my message. Since we haven&#39;t been able to undeniably attribute the key to me, if you were to download my public key and attempt to verify any of my messages, you&#39;ll probably get &quot;Not Verified&quot; or &quot;Not Trusted&quot; since at this moment there&#39;s no way for you to personally attribute the key to me and will have to take my word on faith: for now, we will have to trust-on-first-use. If my keys ever change in a way where the new key is not certified by the old one you&#39;ll know they&#39;ve been forged and you&#39;re talking to someone posing as me, or someone is tampering with this website. Something like that would be very easily done, as the board has no Secure Socket Layering/Transport Layer Security.<br><br>If you&#39;re interested in taking the plunge, I could walk you through some of the functions - GnuPG is very complex and unintuitive (that&#39;s probably why it&#39;s never really seen widespread use in the 20+ years it&#39;s been around), so it does help if you have someone to help. The problem with it is that it was designed in an era when sheer power and features for users was seen as a selling point, and usability, including intuitivity, ability to be easily used, and tolerance to human error was never seen as important. We know now that back then everyone had their priorities backward, I guess hindsight is 20/20. <br><br><br>-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----<br><br>iLUEARMKAB0WIQTfllUBtaeNnRzzfmVK3+74uImA+wUCWXf+PwAKCRBK3+74uImA<br>+2PpAf4iNxUkkHHdh6zR5lPAGT6b6+TM4ry/HCrlDsIhNG8LxRXBqB44lYH48W7n<br>QXWLmsUaIqLz4h1CeMZVJvbkBCOIAf9JRzx4W8KyT4qZewKqURTa2oqg7GI54Rax<br>yLZYoANuLtyPUUqvLNxyqKLHB2E6zsiGj2Sg8PoGIjD87RT/JGYS<br>=ubOl<br>-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----<br></p>

            <p>About ham radio: I&#39;m not too sure if starting with DIY would be a good idea, but any other PPC hams feel free to contradict me, as I don&#39;t know all that much about how to choose equipment.<br><br>About fanfiction: A few times, though, it&#39;s the person&#39;s own fault for not getting a beta reader/not using spellcheck/posting on the Internet when they know they&#39;re not in their right minds.) The FAQ For Other People, in my opinion, really helps explain (albeit in a snarky way) the situations when it is the author&#39;s fault after all. Yeah, do focus on the good parts, but don&#39;t sugarcoat or leave out the bad ones. If you&#39;re going to review someone&#39;s fic (this is starting to sound like you want to review instead of sporking), the objective is that the author learns. Sporking, however, is mainly just for our entertainment, which is why whenever I do missions, I&#39;m probably going to make them Google Docs and have people request for me to share the docs with them. That purpose is the reason why we&#39;re super-snarky about the fics and try our best to keep them away from their authors, and why we tend to keep to ourselves and don&#39;t advertise the PPC in big, bold letters. But if an author finds our sporking, our purpose then becomes giving them insight and explaining why the sporking was needed. (Other folks, feel free to correct me if I&#39;m wrong.)<br><br>About PGP: Ah! That&#39;s pretty interesting! I&#39;m not sure I want to use it for my Internet stuff, at least currently, but I&#39;ll keep it in mind for later down the road, and that&#39;s also very cool information.<br><br>-Twistey<br>The FAQ For Other People:<br><a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/FAQ:_For_Other_People"><a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/FAQ:_For_Other_People">http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/FAQ:_For_Other_People</a></a></p>

            <p>Definitely a sweet story!  For me, though, the highlight was how you describe the TARDIS&#39;s perception of time.  The peeks into alternate timelines and the future is really interesting, especially with how matter-of-fact the TARDIS is about their existence.  It also makes for an interesting show of how the TARDIS&#39;s mind is both similar to ours, and different, because while she can feel bad about the Aviator&#39;s team being dead, and missing them, it&#39;s also fully aware of the timeline where they weren&#39;t ambushed, and regards that timeline&#39;s existence as a mere fact.  Very creative and original!<br><br>—doctorlit is still going to review every posted story from now on, he swears</p>

            <p>That being said, this was something I really liked reading. (I&#39;d say &quot;YES YES YES!&quot; but that&#39;d be over the top). A TARDIS&#39;s POV is a really fun thing to think about, and I like the whole &quot;multi time stream perspective&quot; thing. It&#39;s fun. I&#39;d&#39;ve maybe liked to see more of that way of looking at the world, but conveying it in text is <i>hard</i>, so I can&#39;t blame you.

            <p>This is a fairly simple and creative game. Anyone can play; just reply to the previous post in the thread. Try to avoid branching chains, though!<br><br>Your post will contain three pieces: a <b>superhero/villain name</b>, a <b>corny catchphrase</b> for the hero the previous player named, and a <b>short blurb</b> for the hero the previous player gave a catchphrase to. It goes like this:<br><br>(0. You will put the name of your own hero/villain here.)<br><br>1. <u>Name:</u> <b>American Aardvark</b><br>(You will add a catchphrase to American Aardvark.)<br><br>2. <b>House</b> (This would have been posted by the previous player.)<br><u>Catchphrase:</u> &quot;Never bet against the House.&quot;<br>(You will add a blurb to House)<br><br>3. <b>The Narrator</b> - &quot;Are we sitting comfortably? Then I&#39;ll begin...&quot;<br><u>Blurb:</u> When the Narrator plants her staff in the ground and begins to read, the world around her changes. The story she reads takes shape, spreading in a growing circle from the base of her staff. Skyscrapers can become jungles; oceans can become caves; there is no limit to her transformative powers, nor - as long as she keeps reading - how far they can spread. Only when her staff is uprooted from its place will reality snap back.<br>(You will delete The Narrator from your post.)<br><br>If a <b>completed</b> hero/villain catches your fancy (as the Narrator here), feel free to reply to her blurb post with a creative work featuring her - a picture, a story, anything you want. You can even incorporate other completed characters from the thread! But don&#39;t try and shoehorn it into a full Round Super-Robin post - keep the stories etc separate from the character creation.<br><br>It is possible that there will be a picture of the heroes and villains of Round Super-Robin, once the thread winds down - so go ahead and make them as silly as you like!<br><br><i>Next player: add a new Name, add a Catchphrase to American Aardvark, add a Blurb to House, and delete The Narrator.</i><br><br>hS</p>

His parents always believed him over his brothers, his teachers let him get away with minor (and not so minor) offences, and people always listened to him. One look at his big, brown eyes, and they never doubted a word he said.<br><br>It was only when he was twenty-one and short on cash that he thought he might be able to get away with robbery. <br><br>Thus, Douglas disappeared, and the Brass Hawk was born; a super villain who mesmerizes people with his eyes. The head of a vast criminal organization, he regularly faces down villains and heroes alike, turning them into his own agents--the small moving bits of his vast mechanism. Pieces on his board. Cogs in his machine.<br><br>(Hey, this is fun! Great game, hS!)<br><br>-Alleb</li>

The Earth we know is but a fraction of the true whole, and beings of terrible power and inscrutable purpose seek to take what is the rightful property of mankind: our minds, our personalities, our very souls.

Ha!&quot;<br><br>3. Name: Pack Rat<br>Catchphrase: &quot;What&#39;s yours is mine, what&#39;s mine is mine!&quot;<br><br>Sophia Antonia Cartler always liked pretty things. It was just that her definition of what was pretty was a bit different from most people&#39;s. Her morals fell even farther outside the norm, and she gained a reputation as a weird, mysterious thief who didn&#39;t even consistently take valuable items.<br><br>She was furious when she gained superpowers from an attack on the movie theater she was in, and then delighted once she&#39;d realized that, despite the very random tail she&#39;d grown, she now had the ability to walk through walls. Well, and summon cheese at will, but that was a lot less useful to a lactose intolerant person. Until the time she first used the cheese as projectiles, that is.<br><br>So Sophia continued her stealing, more frequently than before she&#39;d left her job, and she was happy. She&#39;d put on her same mask, let the tail out (what? It unnerved people), and gone straight for Tiffany&#39;s. Her next few sprees were also expensive, to the point where a local newspaper nicknamed her &quot;the Magpie.&quot; Had she continued that trend just a little longer the name might have stuck, but as fate would have it she went next for a series of commonly low-value items. These were so varied and so frequently useless that when a difference paper jeered, &quot;more like a *pack rat*,&quot; that was the name that ultimately stuck.<br><br>Everyone ignored her protests that it was undignified, prejudiced, had connotations of dirtiness, etc. After the first time it led to her capture, Sophia vowed revenge and resolved to be more careful when trying to get the moniker changed. She remains unsuccessful in both respects.</p>

You&#39;re loud, you&#39;re brash, you&#39;ve got awesome powers, and collateral damage is a problem for tomorrow and/or somebody else.

This is not his story.<br><br>When you&#39;re a scientist who people have the temerity to call mad just because you&#39;ve won the Nobel Prize for Wave-Motion Brain Annihilation three years on the bounce, you don&#39;t play by the rules either. What you want is what you get, what you get is what you can grab, and what you can grab generally blasts a whole bunch of interesting exotic particles out the business end whether it&#39;s supposed to or not. That&#39;s as true for Doctor Cranitron as it is for other people who got laughed at in the Academy. This is not his story.<br><br>When heroes and villains fight, people get caught up in it: bystanders, photographers, hostages, it&#39;s a fact of life. So it was when Doctor Cranitron took the SupraCorp tower in downtown Metro City hostage, Gamma Man, that fair metropolis&#39;s edgiest hero, took it upon himself (to the quiet despair of the local constabulary) to rescue the hostages and deal with the Doctor once and for all. They fought, the building collapsed, but Gamma Man got everyone out, just about. The Doctor? Well, he was a smear on the ground, but villains come back from a lot worse all the time. Pavement pizza is just another Tuesday.<br><br>But what about Eduardo Cabrera, the undocumented Honduran immigrant cleaning the windows on the twenty-seventh floor, where so much of the fighting had taken place? What happened when his body was suffused with every example of Raygun Science (Mad) know to man? What happened as he awoke the next day, phased halfway through the rubble of the collapsed building and suspended thirty feet off the ground? This is the Mountaineer&#39;s story.<br><br>This is <i>his</i> story.<br><br>Let&#39;s find out.</p>

            <p>I&#39;d give you a bio of my character formerly known as Mountaineer (at least, a bio of her original incarnation, and not the about-to-be-current one as PPC agent Amber Callahan), but the URL for her page involves my school district, so I&#39;ll copy and paste it into a reply if anyone&#39;s interested.<br><br>I really like what you did with the blurb, especially since it brings more realism to the superhero genre.

            <p>&#39;Looks like you&#39;ve become a bit of a Mountain-<i>rear</i>!&#39; exclaimed Doctor Encaso, roaring with laughter and slapping his knee with one hand and wiping tears from his cheek with the other and murmuring to himself about how much of a good one that one was. His minions, as they always did whenever he had one of these little moments, shuffled awkwardly. <br><br>&#39;How can you possibly oppose my invincible, my unstoppable plan?!&#39; Doctor Encaso collapsed once more into tearful, back-bending laughter, and his minions all tried to look as unaffiliated with him as they possibly could while wearing big conspicuous uniforms with loud &#39;E&#39;s on their fronts. <br><br>&#39;How, possibly, physically possibly, could you <i>ever</i> find a way to use your remarkable matter-phasing powers and ability to travel through any wall or material against me-&#39; he sputtered and chuckled. &#39;If you&#39;re trapped inside of this globule of amber?!&#39; <br><br>&#39;How can your unique ability to escape any physical boundary possibly be used to oppose me, now that you are trapped there, behind that amber?!&#39; <br><br>&#39;How can my crimes ever go challenged, if your astounding wall-phasing talents are held, here, behind this all-encasing wall of amber all around you, oppressing you from all sides?!&#39; <br><br>Doctor Encaso did not laugh after that one, because Mountaineer&#39;s fist promptly drove its way through his face with a horrendous thud, throwing his front teeth gorily to the sides and smacking him into the cracked pavement that he would groan and twitch on until he was eventually dragged off it to prison. His minions continued trying to look unaffiliated, even as they, too, were dragged off. <br><br>But this was not over, for Doctor Encaso. For even as his fellow prisoners glared over at him and readied their fists into balls, he had a greater, even more flawless plan for defeating Mountaineer: <br>Trapping him inside of a very large steel cage. And hiding the key. </p>

            <p>So... I read that they have the Human Factor put into them, but that just left me confused. Wouldn&#39;t they reject it as much as possible; try to leech it out of their systems? Wouldn&#39;t they rather die? I mean, the one Dalek with human DNA ended up being killed anyway, and if Rememberance of the Daleks is anything to go by, even a simple non-human mutation is enough to start a faction war. The Dalek Rusty gained emotions but was no better than before as it still wished to kill, even if its victims were Daleks.<br><br>Given how much the canon Daleks as a whole desire purity... How would a Dalek agent with the Human Factor make it through the day without hating itself? How could it live with itself? Canonically, there&#39;s no such thing as a good Dalek; even with the few examples we got of a small possibility of a good Dalek, those are brief and/or not long lived.</p>

            <p>Good evening (or morning, as the case may be!) to all of you, and I hope you&#39;re having a great whatever-time-of-the-day-it-is wherever you are, &#39;cause I&#39;m here to ruin everything. I brought this up on the Discord server earlier, and a lot of people seemed to like the concept, so I put a bunch of stuff together, and now here I am. <br><br>So, I don&#39;t know if any of you have heard of and/or read <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/tools/memories.bml?user=ekwy&amp;keyword=PPC:+The+Musical&amp;filter=all"><i>PPC: The Musical</i></a> by Ekwy Fields (a member of the PPC who doesn&#39;t seem to be around anymore). It&#39;s a pretty fun read with a cool plot that centers around Agents and Sues alike being influenced by a force that causes them to burst out into song, <i>Once More With Feeling</i> style. It was one of the first PPC stories I ever read, and it was kind of surprising when I went back to reread it out of nostalgia, and I realized that it was first published in 2005- well over a decade ago! Like, <i>wow</i>. It&#39;s been around for a while.<br><br>The concept is as follows. Anybody who wants to lend their voice to a wacky, fun musical about Mary Sues, true love, and the questions of allegiances- and I mean literally <i>anyone</i> that might be vaguely interested, you are in <i>luck</i>. I wrote up the full pitch for this, as well as logistics, character information, and song listings <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Qk9forqZ6V2CvrJpjY0t9CqRqByBN2pv-hKrShI9s0g/edit?usp=sharing">on this document right over here.</a> Please go and check it out and audition and all that cool stuff.<br><br>I am notoriously awful at writing posts, so as soon as I press &#39;post message&#39;, I will probably instantly remember a million things that I forgot to include here. But for now, I think that&#39;s about it. Again, check out that doc, and feel free to ask any questions you might have!<br><br>-Kitty</p>

            <p>Hopefully some people are still looking at this, because I have a few small things to add.<br><br>Firstly, I&#39;ve got a bunch of great auditions so far, and literally all of them have been wonderful. You guys are so great, I&#39;m almost crying. What are you all doing in a place like this when you could be on <i>Broadway</i>, oh my god. <br><br>That being said, I&#39;m planning to close auditions when this thread drops off the Board, so if you haven&#39;t sent me yours, either by email or Discord, and you were planning to- or if you can&#39;t until sometime in the (hopefully near) future, either do so or tell me when you can get it to me by! I&#39;ll extend auditions if need be. :) <br><br>Also, some people have contacted me saying that some of the lyrics don&#39;t quite fit the original songs, and in some cases they&#39;ve sent in corrections that make it fit the beat much better. If you&#39;ve got a correction to make, feel free to do so- it&#39;s really super helpful and I appreciate it.<br><br>That&#39;s all I&#39;ve got for now- see you guys later!</p>

            <p>I&#39;m glad we&#39;re going to correct the scansion as needed. There was a line in &quot;Pure Imagination&quot; that really bugged me, but I sorta muscled through it. It would be less fun operating that way for the whole thing. {= )<br><br>~Neshomeh has Feelings about good scansion.</p>

            <p>Where do I send in my audition (i.e., which email)? Do you need another (second) soprano? Do you want audio or video files? I don&#39;t know if I can record just audio on my laptop, which is why I&#39;m asking.</p>

            <p>The email&#39;s on the document that I linked, sopranos are <i>always</i> welcome, and audio would be the most helpful (try downloading Audacity). Can&#39;t wait to hear your audition, if you decide to send it!</p>

            <p>It just...might happen on Sunday. I need to cook now, and Sunday is the next time I&#39;m likely to be doing Board related things with some energy and time. I can tell you in advance that I&#39;m interested in singing just about any part (and am happy to pull double duty and be in the agent chorus as well), can sing a sort of untrained soprano range, and know the original versions of about half the songs.<br><br>I definitely want to be involved, though! I enjoy singing a lot, and this is exciting :)<br><br>~Z</p>

            <p>...the guy-to-girl ratio in the original story is fairly skewed in favor of people with higher registers. That being said, I&#39;m pretty sure Loki could be considered a baritone- and possibly Zit too! I don&#39;t really know- it&#39;s up to you which part you feel like you could go for. <br><br></p>

            <p>...I&#39;m gonna regret this since I can&#39;t stand the sound of my own recorded singing voice.<br><br>Okay, so. I can sing just about anyone you need me to (exceptions may apply), but I think the Unnamed Yenta-Sue would be my first choice. I&#39;m best at singing lower-pitched, balladesque songs - most <i>Blackmore&#39;s Night</i> songs I&#39;ve heard would be good examples, but I would particularly recommend tracks from the albums <i> Ghost of a Rose</i>, <i>Under a Violet Moon</i>, or a few from <i>The Village Lanterne</i>.<br><br>I sent you my best choice of audition material, but it&#39;s a few months old.

So far so boring, but the paper (credited to Dr. Lucas McGeorge and Dr. Annette Kin) is a discussion of the nature of... midichlorians. Mostly copied and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/shortcuts/2014/aug/08/rogeting-sinister-buttocks-students-essays-plagiarising-thesaurus">Rogeted</a> (which is a link worth reading in and of itself) from Wikipedia&#39;s article on mitochondria, it includes choice quotes like... well, I mean, look at this:<br><br><i>Damage and attendant dysfunction in midichlorians leads to several human diseases due to their central importance in the force and in cell metabolism. Midi-chlorians are microscopic life-forms that reside in all living cells - without the midi-chlorians, life couldn‘t exist, and we‘d have no knowledge of the force. Midichlorial disorders often erupt as brain diseases, such as autism.[8] They continually speak to us, telling us the will o‘ the force. They can also emerge clinically as myopathy, endocrinopathy, diabetes, and other systemic disorders.[12] When you learn to quiet your mind, you will hear =em speaking to you. mtDNA mutations can cause diseases such as Kyloren syndrome, MELAS syndrome and Lightsaber&#39;s hereditary optic neuropathy.[23] These diseases are usually handed down by a force-sensitive woman to her children, because the zygote‘s midichlorians and hence its mtDNA are derived from the maternal ovum.[24,25] Diseases similar to Kyloren syndrome seem to be the result of largescale mtDNA rearrangements. Point mutations in mtDNRey are responsible for other diseases such as myoclonic epilepsy with ragged red fibres, JARJAR syndrome, Lightsaber‘s hereditary optic neuropathy, and others.[23]</i><br><br>It also contains the entire text of Palpatine&#39;s &#39;Tragedy of Darth Plagueis the Wise&#39;. And the references include the likes of &#39;Solo, H.; Bacca, C. (2015). &quot;Endosymbiotic theories for eukaryote origin&quot;&#39;. The point is, it&#39;s not something even a cursory review would let through.<br><br>Of the nine journals which received it, three rejected it out of hand. One tried to charge to publish it. Two requested that it be revised and resubmitted, though for one of them the peer reviewers noted that &quot;The authors have neglected to add the following references: Lucas et al., 1977, Palpatine et al., 1980, and Calrissian et al., 1983&quot;. And three journals actually went ahead and published it.<br><br>I&#39;ve uploaded a copy of the paper <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-ExprXkSDOUNklPUWZkUlF4VG8/view?usp=sharing">here</a>, in case they&#39;ve come to their senses and taken it down.

            <p>I speculate that this &quot;order&quot; was never actually a thing that was supposed to go into effect, anyway.  It was, instead, a distraction from the healthcare debate happening in the Senate.  Trump has a tendency to tweet more-offensive-than-usual things when something big is going on somewhere else.  It&#39;s designed to pull attention where the administration wants it.  Unfortunately, it is incredibly effective and brutally simple.<br><br>People are angry about X?

            <p>I&#39;m glad you guys finally went after that fic!  It feels like that thing has been haunting the Discord for months, now . . .<br><br>I actually kind of like that you started the two agent pairs out on bad footing with each other.  Co-writes typically just have the agents meet each other, and it&#39;s an instant team—and understandably so.  But it&#39;s good to see a different dynamic once in a while.  I also like that you guys also didn&#39;t end the story with the two pairs being Perfect Friends From Now On, but left on a bit of awkward note, yet still with an agreement to go out and eat together.  I feel like that&#39;s a very realistic, slow progression for real people, especially under the circumstances of their initial meeting.<br><br>When I first started reading the mission part and realized that the &quot;inner wolf&quot; nonsense was affecting Ix, I frankly got terrified of the possibilities.  Granted, not actually being in wolf form meant that Ix lacked any super-strength, but she still posed a threat to Granz&#39;s characters.  (Or maybe not to Apecian.  What is he, anyway?)  I&#39;m glad that Charlotte outclassed Ix physically, and that despite the overall somber mood of this mission (which I do feel was appropriate, considering the badfic&#39;s &quot;themes&quot;), you guys didn&#39;t actually have any injuries befall the agents.  I was a bit concerned at Ix&#39;s initial exorcism that you had taken an easy out to that conflict, but of course, Randy wound up being harder to eliminate than that, and stuck around to contribute to the final climax, which feels like the right way to have handled the situation.<br><br>So overall, I think you guys handled an utterly repulsive fic in the best way possible, and used the resources you had available to the best possible effect to keep the plot moving along.  Well done!<br><br>Alas, the following line from your mission is not a full sentence:<br>&quot;Twin wraiths of urple mist that looked something like distorted versions of Lupin’s werewolf form from the movies.&quot;<br><br>—doctorlit would like to not think about this fic ever again, please ok thanks</p>

            <p>It makes me so happy when things like this aren&#39;t just left to die. ^_^ It&#39;s also comforting to know I&#39;m not the only one with ten-year projects still waiting to be completed, and that people are still excited when they get done, even if they weren&#39;t around for the beginning.

I&#39;m dying to know the details of what&#39;s going on that Alec isn&#39;t telling us, but since I&#39;m not brave enough to wade through the RP site myself, I guess I&#39;ll just have to wait for more from you.

            <p>Hey, there!  Just want to say, I was really excited to see you pop up again, and then really excited again when I realized what you were posting!  I had read the blurb about Valcentica on your characters&#39; pages on the wiki, and was really curious to see how that situation would play out in story form.<br><br>I love that you decided to go (basically) journal style for this.  Alec&#39;s narrative voice still carries all the attitude and pride of his spoken dialogue, even without Kitty to play off of.  The sudden time jump, and then continuum jump, at the end are wonderfully startling, after the &quot;opening data&quot; staying largely irrelevant for the early parts of the story.<br><br>I hope we get a bit of follow-up to this, or maybe see Kitty&#39;s version of things?  It does feel like there&#39;s more to learn of this event.<br><br>I look forward to seeing your spin-off continue, too!<br><br>—doctorlit, loving PPC history getting filled in</p>

            <p>I recognized the story within the first few lines, and basically went, &quot;Oh, it&#39;s this!

            <p>Oh, I think so! This was the freakin&#39; albatross around my neck, because this mission was quite a turning point for both Kitty and Alec - and just <i>how</i> will slowly come out in subsequent missions. (I mean, this took me ten years to finally cowboy up and do, and it took quite a long time to pull everything together when I started writing. Years worth of threads to comb through and all. There&#39;s even stuff I left out because Alec wouldn&#39;t have known since he was dead. We had a Super Saiyan Vampire. I can&#39;t make this stuff up.)<br><br>And a few dangling threads or things Alec didn&#39;t go into will definitely be explored. That&#39;s the fun thing about the epistolary format - even with a character who doesn&#39;t strictly <i>lie</i>, you can in many ways have an unreliable narrator.</p>

            <p>This was nice!  Goes to show my own lack of emotional depth: I assumed the encounter with Randy would have been a lot more hurtful to Ix than Apecian&#39;s offhand comments, so I was rather startled when Ix admitted the opposite was true.  I&#39;m glad that Charlotte talked Ix into confronting her fears and leaving the RC.  I also like that the conversation segued into Muggle combat, and gave Ix an opportunity to show off some of her talents, as we don&#39;t get to see her shine much compared to Charlotte.  (Or at least, I haven&#39;t since I started up reading again.)<br><br>One thing stuck out as a possible contradiction to me, though.  Early on, Ix said she doesn&#39;t, &quot;&#39;want to go out without being a boy.&#39;&quot;  But then, when Ix changes her mind about going out, she points to her currently male chest as a reason for staying in.  Am I missing something?<br><br>And finally:<br>&quot;&#39;I know I&#39;m not good enough for her,&#39; Ix began, but <b>qualied</b> when both Charlotte and Olivine began protesting.&quot;<br><br>—doctorlit knows when he tells a qualie, it grows and grows, until it becomes plain as the quanose on his quaface</p>

        <div class="post-body">
            <p>40 days ago, I requested permission. Two weeks later, my permission giver begged off, citing Life Reasons. He transferred my request to Delta Juliette. It&#39;s been 22 days and I haven&#39;t heard a peep from her. Not even a &#39;Hi, I exist.&#39; My permission request is on the third page now with no sign of ever being answered, so I&#39;m reposting it. Here are my prompts:<br><br>Two agents sat in RC 113a. One, an anthropomorphic fighter plane, was performing maintenance on her main gun. The other, a human woman with gold eyes and long black hair tied back in a ponytail, was using said eyes to attempt to glare lasers at the RC&#39;s console. This did not work, due to her unfortunate lack of laser vision. After several silent minutes of fruitless attempts to destroy the console with her gaze, she asked her partner, “Effie?”<br><br>“Yes, Min Ra?”<br><br>“How do you manage to keep so calm all the time, what with that Agni-damned console that you refuse to blow up and won&#39;t let me burn going off at unpredictable intervals? It&#39;s hard to even complete a firebending form without that blasted thing beeping!”<br><br>“It is our duty as PPC agents to be ready at all times to exorcise the influence of Mary Sues. I rather look forward to it,” Effie Raptor answered.<br><br>Min Ra leaned forward from where she was sitting on her bed, pondering what her partner could possibly mean by that. She was looking forward to being woken up at any hour of the night...day… however time worked in HQ. How was that kind of attitude possible, unless…<br><br>Min Ra suddenly sat up straight.<br><br>“I got it!” she exclaimed, “it&#39;s reverse psychology! The console always beeps when you don&#39;t want it to, so if you want it to beep, it won&#39;t and you can get some time to yourself! I&#39;m gonna try that!”<br><br>She then stared intensely at the console with what was probably intended to be an eager look. Effie, curious about what would happen, observed her quietly. She didn&#39;t have long to wait before Min Ra&#39;s attempt turned up a result.<br><br>BEEP!<br><br>“Darnit!”<br><br>Min continued to curse at the console as it lit up and displayed their next mission, like always. Effie made sure to read all the data and conceal her smile at Min&#39;s expense, and Min Ra got their gadgets ready for the assassination to come. Oh well, maybe she&#39;d get the trick to it next time.<br><br>------<br><br>In all of Min&#39;s experience, Effie Raptor was not someone prone to being frantic. She had never yet observed her partner being anything but calm and precise, presumably because being distracted at Mach 2 and 30,000 feet would likely result in a death that would be quite spectacular to anyone but the unlucky fool who had to experience it.<br><br>And yet, there Effie was, nearly tearing the RC apart in search of something. After a few minutes of Effie fruitlessly looking for whatever she&#39;d lost, Min decided to ask her, “What&#39;s lit your hair on fire, Effie?”<br><br>“I lost a package of TNT.”<br><br>Min replied, “Okay, that&#39;s bad, but-”<br><br>“I think it&#39;s on your side of the room.”<br><br>That got a response. Min immediately got off the bed, declaring, “Okay, I&#39;m looking. I am not risking getting blown up in the middle of firebending practice.”<br><br>Min started looking through her stuff, searching for whatever it was that Effie had lost. She had turned her living space into quite a mess by the time she realized she had no idea what she was looking for. She knew what TNT was, but she didn&#39;t know what this particular batch looked like. So she asked Effie, “Um, what should I be looking out for?”<br><br>“An unpainted metal box, small enough to be held with both hands-” Effie began to respond, before Min interrupted. “You&#39;ve got tons of those, you even gave me a few when I broke my shelf last week.”<br><br>Effie shot her partner a disapproving look at the interruption. “And it is clearly labeled &#39;Trinitrotoluene, 4 kg&#39;”<br><br>Min Ra thought for a bit. “Wait, you meant this box?” she asked.<br><br>She then rearranged some of the mess to reveal a small metal box, one of several around. The difference was that this one was entirely unpainted and very clearly labeled &#39;Trinitrotoluene, 4kg&#39;. Min handed it to Effie, who looked rather surprised to see her problem solved just like that. She asked Min: “How did you miss that one?”<br><br>Min shrugged and said, “Didn&#39;t know what I was looking for and thought it was the one I stored my firebending scrolls in.”<br><br>Effie stared at her partner with something resembling visible disbelief. “But it was clearly labeled with what it was. How could you miss it?”<br><br>Min Ra was confused. “No it wasn&#39;t. It&#39;s labeled trinitrotoluene, and you were looking for TNT,” she told Effie.<br><br>Effie, exasperated, corrected her. “They are the same thing. TNT is short for trinitrotoluene.”<br><br>Min sat there for a few moments in silence, blinking and taking what was, in hindsight, freaking obvious. &#39;Trinitrotoluene&#39; was rather unwieldy to say in casual conversation, and English was very conducive to shortening long words. There didn&#39;t seem to be any more she could say on the topic, so instead she apologized. “Sorry about the mistake. I really hate contractions. Pictographs are so much more straightforward.”<br><br>Effie reassured her, “That is comparatively unimportant. Rather more important is that you ask me what you&#39;re looking for before tearing up your room. That will take hours to clean up.”<br><br>Min Ra sighed in irritation. Like many teenagers around the multiverse, cleaning her room was very low on her (metaphorical) list of things she liked to do with her spare time. So she pleaded with Effie. “Can&#39;t I just leave it like this?”<br><br>Effie, now that the trouble was over, had resumed her cold and emotionless demeanor. “Your neuralizer is part of that mess, so no.”<br><br>It took a while and much more foot-dragging, but eventually Min Ra cleaned up her side of the RC under Effie Raptor&#39;s watchful eye. As Effie kept pointing out more important things that she&#39;d missed, either accidentally or on purpose, Min hoped that the console would beep and she&#39;d get a mission she could use to procrastinate her room cleaning.<br><br>But, in accordance with the Laws of Narrative Irony, it never did.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m also sorry about the long wait--something must have come up for Delta Juliette, I suppose.<br><br>But yes, congratulations!

            <p>Sorry you had to wait so long.<br><br>I quite liked both prompts. They have a good amount of humor and do a good job of showing the agents&#39; personalities, and I especially loved the arc about the console from one story to the next. My only lingering question is: how did Effie manage to lose a box of TNT on the wrong side of the room? A precise military-type personage ought to keep better track of such things, I&#39;d think, so a little explanation wouldn&#39;t have been amiss. It didn&#39;t bother me too much by the end thanks to the payoff with the console, but still, something to be aware of. {= )<br><br>I&#39;m happy to see a new DOGA team, and I look forward to seeing them take out the &quot;assains&quot; and burn the bloody mansion in the COS in that fic. Blessings of Kanun and Spelin be upon you!<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>
