            <p>I&#39;m pretty good. I joined a community orchestra and have been learning to play the viola, although I am on a break this semester. I started writing fanfics on AO3 under Miah_Arthur. They are all in Haven for now. It&#39;s a tiny fandom, but was good for a new fanfic author. I have just about finished one in Star Trek Voyager, so branching out. I&#39;ve played a lot of Fallout, and some Dragon Age, and the new PS4 import of Skyrim. We&#39;re up to 6 cats now (8 if you count the two that show up occasionally), so I think I have cemented my status as Crazy Cat Lady.<br><br>Warcabbage is good. He&#39;s thinking about opening a food truck. How crazy is that? Still has the same job he did before. Still makes amazing beer, but now also makes his own sausage, smoked meats, and roasts his own coffee. He&#39;d be hipster material if his job didn&#39;t demand he keep clean shaven, so the gas mask can seal properly.<br><br>You&#39;re not going to believe this, but my oldest is now 17! He&#39;s a junior in high school. He plans to go to college to study microbiology and genetics. He&#39;s particularly interested in defeating antibiotic resistant bacteria. His science classes are doing things that 20 years ago were practically science fiction! They genetically engineered glowing bacteria this week, and he has a project he is planning for microbiology next year to combine bacteria from hot springs with strep to see if it will make them more susceptible to antibiotics. It kind of blows my mind. When I was in high school, the school couldn&#39;t even get enough money for us to dissect worms, forget pigs, and he&#39;s altering the genomes of bacteria. He&#39;d probably get annoyed if I didn&#39;t mention that he is in Quizbowl and his team won state last year, and is about to play for state again this year.<br><br>The middle kid (15, sophmore) has put us all through some truly awful times (himself included). He&#39;s living with my mother permanently now, but it seems to be good for him. He&#39;s happy up there, and that school has a better art program. He is a seriously amazing artist. I think he could make a living at it, he&#39;s so good.<br><br>The little one is 8 (9 soon). He&#39;s in 2nd grade. He keeps me busy. I homeschool him, and ferry him around to OT, PT, Speech (on horseback for that), Vision Therapy, counseling. He also plays violin in orchestra, does musical theater (they do the middle school level scripts, Pinocchio this spring), and a special needs, no scores kept baseball program, which has promised to let him work in the concession stand after his games. He&#39;s really, really into concession stands and playing shop right now.<br><br>He&#39;s doing amazing though. You&#39;ll like this one. He is reading A Series of Unfortunate Events for fun right now. Even more amazing is that last May he couldn&#39;t identify the entire alphabet, but with the help of Vision Therapy he&#39;s reading Lemony Snicket. That&#39;s about a 6.8 AR reading level!<br><br>What have you been up to? It&#39;s great to see familiar faces. I was kind of afraid that I&#39;d get here and everyone I knew would be gone. <br><br></p>

            <p>I&#39;ve tried to get him to look at the PPC, but he&#39;s a total luddite. If the school didn&#39;t require him to use the school issued laptop, he would barely even touch a computer. He&#39;s not on social media, and has an old flip phone with $5.00 worth of texts and calls a month just so he can get me to pick him up after Quizbowl practices. He doesn&#39;t even see the point in having a smart phone. It&#39;s shocking for a teenager.</p>

            <p>At least he&#39;s driven, I suppose; I wouldn&#39;t want the world to lose out on the self-eating vegetable (an invention that children the world over consider deserving of a Nobel Prizr for Everything Ever) purely because the inventor was distracted by cracking wise about the Legolas-related contents of some fangirl&#39;s fevered imagination.<br><br>Still, one assumes he has at least a certain level of computer literacy. Sell it to him thus: no matter how many times you win your Quizbowl or how many strains of bacteria you force to bounce around on a hot spring (there may have been something lost in transmission there), no employer will touch you with a ten-foot pole if you&#39;re not fluent and adept with computers. Hell, microbiology makes them even more important; predictive algorithms&#39;ll be how most of the advances he&#39;ll be making will be modeled in the first place, and if he doesn&#39;t know how to code them then he&#39;s very much up a certain creek without paddles, a canoe, or even a conk-mounted clothes peg.<br><br>Then again, what do I know. I&#39;m the kind of sad sack who&#39;s soon to embark on a <i>Creative Writing</i> MA... that I&#39;ve got onto despite not having any previous qualifications in English after GCSE-level.

            <p>Oh, man.  Your kids are amazing.  You must be so proud of them!<br><br>I&#39;ve moved out of my parents&#39; house into a little condominium.  It&#39;s five minutes from the zoo, so it&#39;s a lovely save on gasoline.  I also finally got accepted as a zookeeper, and I&#39;ve sort of inadvertently become the sidekick to all the building exhibit teams.  I get to work different areas all week, so I stay trained well enough to cover vacation and sick days when they roll around.  It&#39;s quite fun, and I get to work with a wide variety of animals—reptiles and mammals, and a few birds.<br><br>I&#39;m totally turning into a workaholic, though.  I keep finding excuses to work on little projects after my shift ends, and next thing I know, the sun is down and I&#39;m famished because my stomach was expecting dinner already.  One good bit about it, though: the head keeper of the buildings teams learned last week that I&#39;ve been taking the black light flashlight through all the buildings once a week to hunt for scorpions, and she talked to the collections curator (the position above all zookeepers), and he okayed putting those nights on my time card.  Yay!<br><br>The Discord chat is acting weird about creating the official invite link for people.  Only the temporary links are working right now, and they expire.  We&#39;ll have to try and get you a link sometime you&#39;re actively online so we can get you in there.<br><br>—doctorlit</p>

            <p>There&#39;s this crippling fear in my mind that prevents me from leaving groups or joining them, (discord servers, following someone, friending them etc.). This fear has led me to some events that have had less than desirable results. I wonder if anyone else has this fear, whether it&#39;s common or not. So.<br>Does anyone have this very fear?</p>

            <p>I forgot to add the main part of said fear. The main part is when you contact someone you know, and that someone cannot remember you, no matter how hard you try, they cannot remember you. <br><br>There we are!</p>

            <p>But I don’t call it fear; I’m just overly shy. I might never have posted on this board if there hadn’t been this outsider hauling <b>inaccurate</b> accusations around to explain why they didn’t like the PPC, so I just <b>had</b> to step forward to show another outsiders view, before I made a proper introductory post.<br><br>Also, I don’t think of it as crippling. Over the years, I persuaded myself that I <b>like</b> to be the nerd in the ivory tower, and that I don’t want lots of friends or to be considered a valuable member of a community (and then the PPC happened). That’s probably not an advisable way to follow, although it worked for me, with lots of luck.<br><br>Fortunately, I don’t have <b>that</b> nightmare. I don’t care whether I’m remembered and recognized. (But then, why do I use the same name all over the internet, unless the site insists that I can’t have a space in my name, and it’s too many letters anyway?)<br><br>My greatest fear is that I unintentionally say something that offends people I want to like me. Not talking in my native tongue here doesn’t help with that. So, far too often I prefer to say nothing at all. Which probably causes that people do not know me well enough to actually like me. Yeah, I’m aware of my shortcomings; I’m working on them since nineteen-fiftythree.<br><br>HG</p>

            <p>But of course, you need to specify which ones...<br><br>We have the Natural History and Science Museums side by side, which is always my #1 default, but if you prefer stuff that&#39;s a) made by people and b) not made of metal, you might want to consider the British Museum instead (<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DsIT-xozSzubiYIm2xK4nnAXxK8ekxXLf-UV8us4RF4/pub">we went there in &#39;14</a>, we&#39;ve never taken a Gathering to the others). Or if for some reason you like... I dunno, art? Fashion? Whatever&#39;s in there, there&#39;s the Victoria and Albert museum too.<br><br>And that assumes you want to get in for free! If you&#39;re prepared to pay, you can see the crown jewels and a bunch of weapons in the Tower of London, or... uh... probably lots of other things, I dunno, I don&#39;t like spending money. ^_^<br><br>Though if you want a chance of finding an actual (stuffed and/or skeletal) seal, the Natural History Museum is the place to go. (It&#39;s also far and away the prettiest of the buildings, having been created as a &#39;cathedral of science&#39;, because Victorian scientists were <i>awesome</i>.)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Sorry to break it to you that way. :( Yeah, she&#39;s* been removed in favour of the blue whale skeleton. It&#39;s not all bad - they&#39;re sending her on a tour of the UK, and then constructing a bronze replica outside the front of the museum.

            <p>Good to see you back, however briefly. I&#39;d say we should at some point try to finish/edit our number of old cowritten missions and actually post them, but it doesn&#39;t seem too high on either of our lists of priorities right this second, so we can leave that for another day. :)<br><br>It was an interesting survey to take, really. Funnily enough, it&#39;s only recently that I even learned this new fandom meaning for &#39;discourse&#39;; just in time, I suppose. As for squick vs trigger...I hadn&#39;t quite made the connection that they were being used in the same way--they&#39;re certainly connected, now that I&#39;m thinking about it, but do people really treat them as the same thing? I&#39;d always viewed them as having different nuances: related, but certainly not identical. Hm.<br><br>Anyway. Good luck! Hope it goes well and is interesting to put together and write up.<br><br>~Zing (formerly DawnFire--I can&#39;t remember if you last dropped in before or after I changed it. I feel like it was after, but just in case...)<br><br>PS: To anyone reading this who wants to know, the Purim RP will probably now appear <i>after</i> Pesach (aka Passover). So, after a couple more days. Of course, I might get it up tomorrow, but it seems unlikely at this point. It&#39;s still going to happen, though. ~Zing</p>

Aug &#39;03-February 2005.<br>-Veteran. Feb &#39;05-June 2008.<br>-Olderbie. Jun &#39;08-May 2012.<br>-Oldbie. May &#39;12-September 2015.<br>-Middlebie. Sept &#39;15-September 2016.<br>-Newbie. Sept &#39;16-February 2017.<br><br>Any thoughts?<br><br><br>PS: Personally, I think the Newbie, Middlebie, Oldbie, and Olderbie should be based on time since they joined the PPC.<br>For example, Newbie could be people from 0-6 months, while Middlebie would be from 6-18 months, etc.<br>However, I feel like Originalbie, Acientbie, and Vetern(bie) should be stationary (especially because the start and end dates are based around different events [See hs&#39;s original post]).<br><br>Love to hear your thoughts.</p>

            <p>Trying to make it an official timeline would make the hierarchy of the PPC even more blatant. As it is, we&#39;ve already got a bit of a problem (just my opinion, sorry, but it&#39;s what I&#39;ve seen) where people who&#39;ve been around long enough have a sort of tenure, and giving them the ability to point at an official calendar and say &quot;I&#39;ve been here longer than you, that&#39;s why XYZ!&quot; won&#39;t really help matters.<br><br></p>

            <p>The way I understand it, tenure means you have a contract that says you can&#39;t be fired from your job for a certain period of time. Not sure how that concept applies to a community where we all hang out voluntarily and don&#39;t get paid for what we do here. I find the implication that I or anyone else who&#39;s been around &quot;long enough&quot; should be up for &quot;firing&quot; from the Board disturbing and a bit hurtful, so if that&#39;s not what you meant, please clarify.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Here in the UK, there has for several years been active pushing of the &#39;it&#39;s okay to talk about mental health issues&#39; message. So yes, I certainly hope that if a newbie had a meltdown of that kind, the PPC would be understanding (once we understood what was going on).<br><br>I feel like your &#39;tenure&#39; comment is portraying things kind of backwards. What you seem to be talking about in this example is not having enough trust in newbies, rather than too much in oldbies.

So is reaffirming it over and over again over the weeks, or months, or years. If you build up enough good interactions to outweigh the bad ones by a wide enough margin, then yes, people are going to be more likely to forgive the mistakes. That&#39;s just social math.

            <p>As a newbie, I love how welcoming the PPC has been to me and I would hate to do anything to ruin that atmosphere.<br>That said, it might be possible, if reworked with care, for a list like this to instead enhance this welcoming atmosphere.<br><br>The easiest (though probably least effective) way to do this is by making sure this list is always preceded and/or proceeded by a disclaimer saying that none of these categories are more important than any other.<br>That way, if someone tries to use the list to prove that their opinion is more important, you can point them back to the same source they used to counterpoint them.<br>It is very effective to be refuted by one of your own sources. I probably know this from experience.<br>However, I wouldn&#39;t recommend this method, as it&#39;s very easy to just leave off the disclaimer (on purpose or on accident) and newbies might have a hard time calling them out on it.<br><br>Another way might be to take each of the sentences and add nice descriptions to them that both act as a disclaimer and as entertainment.<br>Very rough example: Newbies are replaceme... I mean invaluable additions to the PCC. Even though they have only been here less than 6 months, we value these people&#39;s opinions as much as any other PPCer.<br>While that is only a rough example, I hope you can see how this might work.<br>If the sentence is enjoyable enough, someone trying to use their status to win an argument might look up the quote just for fun.<br>Also, with the time frame tied to the disclaimer, it will be harder the leave it off.<br><br>So, what do you all think?<br>Do you think this is a good idea?<br>Is it a terrible idea?<br>Do you like the method but don&#39;t think it works here?<br>Or do you just want to talk about our general approach to newer members in general?<br><br>Leave a comment. Your opinion is just as valid and wanted as any PPCer.<br><br>PS: I would really like to hear people discuss about our approach to newbies. While I believe it is already amazing, there is always ways to make it better.</p>

            <p>As a newbie myself, I feel that I have really been welcomed with open arms onto this wonderful community. Seriously, you guys are awesome. <br><br>But, we need to explain a few more things on arrival. I know we have the Constitution and the Original Series, but I feel that newbies need to see more examples​ of stories, especially ones representative of the PPC as it is today. Jay and Acacia were awesome, but that was nearly two decades ago. Stories by board members active today would really help, in my opinion. <br><br>As well as this, I suggest a &quot;sponsor&quot; system to help newbies adjust. Each newbie gets a more experienced member&#39;s email address, so that their questions can be more easily and quickly answered. Plus, talking to one person is much less daunting than addressing an entire community like ours. <br><br>Lastly, a who&#39;s who would help a lot with orientation. Just who writes what and their responsibilities here would be great. </p>

            <p><a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/PPC_Wiki">The PPC Wiki</a>!<br><br>I kid—Iximaz already pointed the wiki out, and I know it&#39;s not the be-all, end-all of information. It is impersonal, too. Not the same as having a live person to talk to. I did try to write the main page with newcomers in mind, though, so I&#39;d love any feedback about how well it introduces the PPC and various information. (And, er, do people even look at the main page?) I think it does address where to find more missions and other stories, at least.<br><br>As for a who&#39;s who, that&#39;s harder. There are rather a lot of us, with people coming (yay!) and going (boo!) somewhat frequently. You may encounter some names you recognize in the various FAQs, but many of the people who worked on those have since moved on. You can look up some of us on the wiki, but that will only get you so far, since not all of us have devoted a lot effort to building a user page. (Which is fine! Our home is here, not there.)<br><br>I guess the only real solution is for everyone to individually introduce themself a little bit when welcoming a newbie—just a little &quot;hi, I&#39;m Soandso, I write Agents Thus and Such&quot; with maybe a link to your user page, or website, or story hub, or whatever.<br><br>Not everybody welcomes every newbie, though. There is no perfect system, I fear.<br><br>~Neshomeh<br><br>P.S. Hi, I&#39;m Neshomeh. I&#39;m a Permission Giver here.

            <p>You can check out the page on the Wiki <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Big_Sib/Little_Sib">here</a>. It&#39;s been around for a while but it&#39;s never really taken off, which makes me sad. <br><br>As for the &#39;more examples of stories&#39;, there&#39;s always the Other Prominent Agents tab on the Wiki as well. <br><br>Honestly, I think the reason why people don&#39;t explain much to newcomers in the PPC is because, well, newbies tend to not stick around. Confession time: I have a welcome speech that I copy and paste (and sometimes slightly alter depending on what the newcomer says they&#39;ve already read). Going to the trouble of writing out a creative hello just gets discouraging when a newbie vanishes into the internet, never to be seen again. And if a newbie has questions, well, that&#39;s what the Wiki is for.</p>
