            <p>Thank you, Harry Potter.<br><br>You did not teach me why reading was worth it - I knew far before I met you. But your touch has still been clearly visible in my own story.<br><br>You wanna know what my first-ever TRPG character was named? Expecto Patronem, more commonly called Expelliarmus.<br><br>You wanna know what one of the biggest mainstays of my daydreams is? Magic of all kinds.

            <p>*mic feedback*<br><br>Testing, testing... there we go!<br><br>Well, look at the time! September is finally here, and you know what that means!<br><br>That&#39;s right! Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, children of all ages (well, maybe not all ages. Preteens and up?), it is time for the annual re-opening of Fanfic World! The PPC is in dire need of more fanfic to be written about it—so go wild and have fun!<br><br>((The following has been mercilessly cribbed from hS&#39; post last year.))<br><br><b>What is this?</b> This is the thread where we let our inner badfic writers have free rein. All PPC stories are technically fanfics of the Original Series - but they&#39;re all goodfics. That&#39;s clearly unreasonable - most fanfic of anything is terrible. So this is your chance to write the baddest of the badfics. Go nuts!<br><br><b>Who can I write about?</b> Any agents in the PPC are open for you to mutilate. There&#39;s a Creativity Shield around ffW, so everything here is emphatically uncanon. The only exceptions are agents of people who have left the PPC, and, if someone asks in this thread that their agents not be used, please honour that.<br><br><b>Where do I post?</b> In this thread, please. I don&#39;t know if anyone will be archiving the games this time &#39;round—I&#39;d do it myself, but I don&#39;t have the know-how.<br><br><b>What name should I post under?</b> You should come up with the badficauthorest name you can, of course! <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=300998;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">Take a look at some of our previous examples.</a><br><br><b>What sort of story should I write?</b> A bad one! Obviously. But also one that&#39;s fun to read. Illegible ultra-typo stories are a bit boring after the first one, y&#39;know?<br><br><b>Can I leave reviews?</b> Emphatically yes - that&#39;s half the fun of the game! But do remember to leave them in character - and equally, remember that the flames you receive are not real flames. They&#39;re a game. Don&#39;t get upset.<br><br><b>Do I need a beta?</b> Hahahahahahahaha. Don&#39;t be ridiculous. ^-^ What sort of badfic writer has a beta?<br><br><b>Do I need Permission?</b> Again, what sort of badfic writer asks permission? (No. No you don&#39;t.)<br><br><b>Why are we doing this?</b> Because it&#39;s fun!</p>

            <p>((I entirely place the blame for this one on GMA and his tendency to find completely off-the-wall werewolf matefics.))<br><br><b>Summary: Agent Ix, better known as Faolan, reclaims her rightful place as the pack&#39;s Alpha Queen. Harem.<br><br>I’m changing some of the characters into werewolves for the purpose of this story. I hope you like it!</b><br><br>Agent Ix was an enigmatic young woman. Faolan, as she was rightfully called—it meant wolf—was an agent of the PPC like everyone else, but she had a secret. A dark, monstrous secret. Faolan was a werewolf, and one that hungered for flesh. Not to eat… but to love.<br><br>She thought she was doomed to be a loner amongst agents until the day she met another werewolf, her soulmate, Charlotte Moon, and discovered she was none other than the wolf that had turned her. The secret coven of werewolves that lived in the PPC were about to gain a new pack member.<br><br>Faolan moaned as Charlotte drew her closer to her body. &quot;Oh, Charlotte... my mistress, my Alpha, my mate...&quot;<br><br>&quot;What is it, my dear?&quot; Charlotte purred, biting her ear.<br><br>&quot;Take me away from the PPC,&quot; she said breathily. &quot;They suppress the wolf here, make it impossible for me to transform... poison me with Wolfsbane... keep me from my pack...&quot;<br><br>Charlotte chuckled softly and knotted her fingers in Faolan&#39;s hair. &quot;I&#39;ll have to teach you to be a good little submissive after all these years left untrained,&quot; she growled.<br><br>&quot;Yes, mistress,&quot; Faolan gasped, feeling a thrilling tingle race through her body at her words.<br><br>&quot;Fifteen years away from the pack.. I should have taken you as mine from the moment I first bit you,&quot; Charlotte said.<br><br>&quot;My parents never understood me,&quot; Faolan said, her lip curling. &quot;They would chain me up every month rather than let me roam free to hunt as our kind has the right to!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Despicable,&quot; Charlotte said. She traced a finger down the side of Faolan&#39;s face. &quot;Now that it&#39;s been so long, I&#39;m going to need to refresh your bite. Hold still, pup.&quot;<br><br>Faolan obeyed, grateful to her mistress for the new opportunity she was giving her. She flinched when her teeth pierced the skin of her shoulder, and hot blood burned as it ran down her arm. But it was a good kind of pain, and she wished she would bite her again. She was wild with desire now, as the werewolf&#39;s saliva began to take its amorous effect on her senes.<br><br>Her eyes rolled back in her head and she passed out.<br><br>After Faolan awoke and was taken to the PPC’s hidden chambers for bathing, Charlotte ordered her to undress. She did so, shyly, but her shyness was mollified when she realized how hungrily she was looking at her body.<br><br>“Every scar you carry on your body,” Charlotte said, coming over to trace a thin one on her lip, “is a mark of your unwillingness to accept who you truly are. Your body rejects my blessing and marks you as ugly. Now that you have found your mate, however…” She leaned in and licked a scar that ran along Faolan&#39;s collarbone. There was a warm, soothing sensation, like a salve being applied to a burn, and as they watched, the scar faded away to nothingness.<br><br>As Charlotte bathed her, she licked along her skin, healing every blemish and scrape she had inflicted upon herself.<br><br>“Do not restrain yourself, my pup,” Charlotte said, her hot breath tickling her ear. “You’re like a flower denied sunlight: without it, you wilt, but when nurtured, you blossom into something beautiful.”<br><br>She looked at the mirror he held to her and gasped. Gentle, yet intense amber eyes peeked out from long, curled lashes, and her cheeks were rosy, smooth, and dangerously alluring. Her eyebrows arched inquisitively, giving her a playful, mischievous, mateworthy look, and her body was nothing but curves and smooth, flawless skin.<br><br>Charlotte couldn’t help but groan when she saw her new mate. “You look like the Queen,” she said, trailing kisses along Ix’s collarbone. “Even your scent… but no, you couldn’t be…”<br><br>“Be what?” Faolan asked.<br><br>Charlotte’s orange eyes met Faolan&#39;s amber ones.<br><br>“The reborn Werewolf Queen,” Charlotte said.<br><br><b>So what do you think? Leave good reviews and I’ll update again, loves! Next chapter will be about werewolfs in the PPC and I can’t wait to share with you!</b></p>

            <p>AN: You know how there&#39;s an OFU for practically every fandom out there? Well, JayBird had an inkling of a cool idea; what if there was one for the PPC? But the result was predictably illegible and Ronion kinda-sorta indirectly challenged the rest of us to rewrite it better, so, here I go! All OCs mentioned belong to their original authors.<br><br>Chapter One<br><br>On a beautiful summer morning in the Shire, an elf called Tallulah Greensleeves walked along the riverbank. Except, she wasn&#39;t truly an elf at all.<br><br>She was a fangirl. And not just any fangirl, a PPC fangirl. How she&#39;d ended up as an elf in the Shire was anyone&#39;s guess. She said she was Legolas&#39; sister and had learned alongside Aragorn, but she sometimes claimed that Frodo and Sam (Rosie never showed up, conveniently) had raised her. Once she&#39;d almost convinced Merry and Pippin she was a mermaid.<br><br>Whatever the case, she was here now, and she was determined to find a way for the PPC to recognize her and sort out her situation. She kept a watchful eye out for Sues, even though most Suethors rarely if ever wrote about the Shire. If she could help identify and assassinate one, they would surely rescue her and train her in the ways of being an agent. Maybe she&#39;d even get a chance to find true love!<br><br>As soon as she thought that, a swirling blue portal opened underneath her and dumped her flat on her butt in a dreary gray hallway. A daisy and a few dandelions turned to look at her.<br><br><i>Welcome to Headquarters, Miss Greensleeves,</i> said the daisy. <i>Please do not scream, you&#39;ll see much stranger things than psychic flowers.</i><br><br>&quot;I know,&quot; said Tallulah. &quot;I&#39;ve read a whooooole lot about this business. Why am I here, anyway?&quot;<br><br><i>You&#39;ve been chosen to attend Tofu Hop. Did you not receive an application letter?</i> The Daisy tilted its head slightly.<br><br>&quot;Uh...no...? What&#39;s Tofu Hop, anyway? Sounds like a dance or a fllash game.&quot;<br><br><i>It&#39;s neither,</i> said one of the dandelions. <i>Follow us and you&#39;ll find out.</i><br><br>So the Daisy and the dandelions led her to (according to the very large sign next to the doors) the Not As Big As The Big Auditorium But Bigger Than The Small Auditorium Auditorium, which was full of fangirls.<br><br>Tallulah only noticed the Sunflower Official on stage, though, and ran up to hug him.<br><br><i>Oh no you don&#39;t!</i> yelled a Security Dandelion, and grabbed Tallulah by the arm. <i>First rule of an Official Fanfiction University: No glomping the canon characters.</i><br><br>&quot;But the Flowers aren&#39;t from any canon so it&#39;s OK to hug them!&quot; Tallulah countered, struggling.<br><br>&quot;The PPC counts as a canon,&quot; said an elf with black and gold hair. &quot;Also, hi, I&#39;m Jessaminthe Windflower Evenstar, second daughter of Elrond and Princess of Rivendell.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Cool name. I&#39;m Tallulah Greensleeves, Legolas&#39; sister. I studied alongside Strider--you know, Aragorn? Also I might be part-mermaid.&quot; The Security Dandelion released her, and she went to a seat with her name written in Elvish on the back.<br><br>&quot;How the ... can you be Legolas&#39; sister and a mermaid?&quot; demanded a pink-eyed girl with black hair. &quot;There are no fish-women in Arda, and if there were Thranduil wouldn&#39;t have ...ed one.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Nobody asked you, Morana,&quot; said Jessaminthe. <br><br>&quot;Oh, like your backstory&#39;s any more plausible, you stupid shallow bi--&quot;<br><br>There was a pointed psychic cough from the stage, and everyone turned to the Sunflower Official. <i>Now that I have your attention, fans, let me officially welcome you to PPC Headquarters.</i><br><br>&quot;Yaaaaaay!&quot; Tallulah cheered.<br><br><i>I appreciate your enthusiasm. Now then, I&#39;m sure you know that there has been a lot of bad fanfiction about the PPC.</i><br><br>There was a general uneasy murmur, and many of the fangirls exchanged nervous or guilty glances with each other. Morana, however, simply looked smug.<br><br><i>So, just as Miss Cam started the Official Fanfiction University of Middle-Earth to deal with an influx of bad Tolkien fanfiction, we have created the Official Fanfiction University of the Headquarters of the PPC. Yes, it&#39;s long, but we needed something that would fit the acronym of &#39;Tofu Hop&#39;.</i><br><br>&quot;So that&#39;s what it means,&quot; said Tallulah.<br><br>The Sunflower Official waved his leaves, and a host of other Flowers and famous Agents came on stage. The Bonsai Mallorn, the Lichen, the Marquis and the regular Daisy...and on the Agent side, Luxury, Dafydd Illian, Trojanhorse and Paddlebrains, Suicide, Miiro, Supernumerary, even Jay and Acacia (no one quite knew how; probably a plothole). Tallulah, to her credit, did not squee, though she did have a very enthusiastic grin.<br><br>&quot;They&#39;re all so pretty...&quot; said Jessaminthe with a dreamy expression.<br><br>(2nd AN: I&#39;m not apologizing.)<br>((Over to you, Zingenmir ^^))</p>

            <p>A/n: So this is the second chapter! I&#39;m sooooo sorry for the delay :( Anyway, lightfairy406 and I both wanted to do the challenge, so we thought we&#39;d make it into a...a...I think it&#39;s called a &#39;round robin&#39;? Weird.<br><br>Anyway! Chapter two ahoy! Obviously my style&#39;s a little different, but that&#39;s what makes it fun!!<br><br>Chapter 2<br><br>While Jessaminthe sighed over the &#39;oh so dreamy&#39; agents, up on the stage there was some grumbling going on.<br><br>&quot;I still don&#39;t know how you got me to agree to this,&quot; Trojanhorse--better known as Trojie--muttered. She aimed this at her partner, a tall redheaded woman named Paddlebrains (or, frequently, Pads).<br><br>&quot;My stunning beauty?&quot;<br><br>Trojie snorted.<br><br>&quot;The way I hounded--ha--you until you gave in,&quot; Pads corrected. &quot;It&#39;ll be a nice change, at least--didn&#39;t you say you wanted a break?&quot;<br><br>Trojie stared grimly out over the colorful crowd. &quot;This isn&#39;t a break. This is a punishment.&quot;<br><br>&quot;At least you&#39;re both doing it,&quot; an Elf chimed in. He was Dafydd Illian, of the dark hair and (currently) grumpy expression. &quot;Connie laughed in my face when I suggested it. She wouldn&#39;t even come closer than New Cal!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Tough luck,&quot; said Agent Suicide. He was giving the audience a stern look; it didn&#39;t seem to be turning anyone off. &quot;Welcome to hell.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Hell is empty and the devils are all here,&quot; Jay paraphrased cheerfully. &quot;I think it&#39;ll be fun.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I came out of retirement for this,&quot; Dafydd said to no one in particular. He looked gingerly out at the crowd. A small (but growing) contingent waved at him and giggled; he grimaced. &quot;I regret it already.&quot;<br><br>*<br><br>In another part of the crowd, several small clumps of students had formed. One spoke in an overblown French accent, while a second was having increasingly more difficulty holding back laughter as he responded in an equally overblown (if rather more affected) German accent. Neither was paying much attention to the SO anymore. Someone wearing a nametag with a screenname possessed of too many Xes, the name of an Egyptian god, and some numbers was listening to them with great interest.<br><br>There were others, of course, but three stood out. One of these was a woman who might have been in her twenties but might also have been a teenager: it was rather hard to tell. She was bouncing up and down with her hands clasped together like an anime character, all but squeeing. Her name tag sparkled with glitter gel pen hearts and carried a surprisingly well-known name in the PPC fandom: JayBird.<br><br>Next to JayBird stood another woman, who looked to be roughly the same age--whatever that age was. She shifted from foot to foot, and sometimes looked around nervously, but for the most part her gaze stayed fixed on JayBird. She seemed almost...awed, if a little unsure. Her tag read &#39;brandywine<em>baby89.&#39;<br><br>The third of their group--if it could be termed that--was yet another woman. This one looked as though, like Narcissa Malfoy, she had smelled something nasty. She looked down her nose at everyone around her, particularly the group with the accents. The only one to escape her disdain, apart from the Flowers and agents, was the fellow whose pronounced German accent was now slipping away in a tide of laughter. *Him* she looked at with approval.<br><br><i>Now, you will of course be attending classes beginning at...</i> the Sunflower Official told them all. The telepathic voice reached everyone in the room, even if not everyone listened to what it said. It continued.<br><br>Up on the stage, Supernumerary pursed his lips and held back a loud sigh. <i>This is going to be a very long year,</i> he thought. <i>We&#39;d better get something out of it.</i><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>A/n: So!! I figured Lemony Eggnog was right, and the authors should go in too! Maybe we&#39;ll even see some subplots with them ;</em>) Anyway, I&#39;ve tried to leave it kind of open so that both lightfairy and I have something to work with before something really takes shape; hope y&#39;all like it!! I had fun :) :) :)<br><br>Next chapter...well, I don&#39;t know what&#39;s happening next chapter, but I&#39;m sure it&#39;s gonna be awesome! Take it away, lightfairy406!<br><br>((Hope everyone liked their cameos! If you didn&#39;t show up and you&#39;d like to in future, just mention it in a comment.<br><br>Minis I&#39;ve left for another chapter, once someone decides what they really ought to be. I vote against mini-minis--they don&#39;t seem quite as funny as, say, mini-consoles, and they&#39;d probably get lost or stepped on a lot due to size. Also, they&#39;d be more cute than anything else, wouldn&#39;t they? Except possibly the mini-Aragogs, who&#39;d basically just be talking spiders of slightly above average size?<br><br>Also, EPL--I did consider treating it as an unplanned addition/takeover, but then thought maybe avoiding an IC fight would be good so the writing would go faster. Feel free to go &quot;well, actually, I don&#39;t think you really understood when I said we should each write *our own version*, but...might as well now that it&#39;s happening...&quot; or something if you want, though; Avlates can have problems with jumping to conclusions if you&#39;d like.<br><br>And...that&#39;s about it. I don&#39;t know why I feel like I took a while to sit down and write this chapter when it&#39;s only been two days, but there we go: time stretches when you&#39;re exhausted.<br><br>Unbetaed, of course, because *come on*. I haven&#39;t even looked it over, though, which... /pumps fist/ Badfic GAAAAAAAMES<br><br>Anyway.

            <p>I&#39;ve remembered I actually drew a picture of Brandy (in 2006, that&#39;s over 10 years ago, my <i>god</i>). It&#39;s awful, <a href="https://neshomeh.deviantart.com/art/Brandy-Banks-44069803">but here</a>. Pretty sure this is her in high school. I reckon she&#39;s not much different now. All the LotR swag, definitely. Maybe an &quot;I &lt;3 PPC&quot; shirt instead of that one. I dunno.<br><br>Ah, poor Nume. I got to thinking about what course he would teach, and came to the conclusion that he would spend an entire lesson making the students write &quot;I will not ship Supernumerary, at all, ever&quot; as many times as they can until time runs out. Of course, someone inevitably starts writing fanfic instead, and then they&#39;ll have to be killed. Or at least punished somehow, OFU style. *g*<br><br>And naturally GrammarBootCamps will be run by the DTE, yes? ^_^<br><br>~Neshomeh might want to help with ideas, but not actually do the writing.</p>

            <p>((I especially like the...beaded thing I don&#39;t know the name of. And it&#39;s great to have a visual. I actually have really minor plans for Brandy in this story, which I&#39;ll hopefully still remember in a few days to a week...<br><br>...GrammarBootCamps. I think Mara and Isaiah should make an appearance, don&#39;t you? :D<br><br>As for Nume...I can&#39;t help but wonder what class he&#39;s actually doing that in. And how he&#39;s justifying it as relevant to the subject matter. It&#39;d be hilarious if there was no strong connection but he made that the first lesson anyway...<br><br>...come to think of it, as the original creators of the PPC, shouldn&#39;t Jay and Acacia be the shadowy Headmistresses? Well, maybe they&#39;re taking a more active role. Or, more likely, the agents are around being agents and the actual writers are in the shadows...that or the SO is serving as Headmaster by proxy. That would make sense, since in-universe the Flowers set the place up.<br><br>Also, did you catch Lemony&#39;s appearance? It seems I forgot to identify her by name in the end, but she&#39;s the third woman in the JayBird and Brandy trio.<br><br>Aaand my final reply (to hS) may have to wait for later, since I have things to look over before class...whoops. Well, 3/4 is pretty good for early morning before class...<br><br>~Z))</p>

            <p>Yes, yes, absolutely we should have Mara and Isaiah.<br><br>For Nume&#39;s class, I thought there might be a unit on shipping/romance and how not to, with several guest instructors from among the most affected agents. Who&#39;s actually in charge, I don&#39;t know.<br><br>Or, as you say, he could be doing something else entirely and making a point of it anyway. *g* Funnily enough, he was actually thinking of being a lit teacher had he not wandered into the PPC instead. Maybe his class would be on PPC canon, and actually knowing it before you sit down to write fanfic? Ooh, he might be the Elrond of this OFU, the guy with the mountains of reading homework and the most feared essay assignments. And the Eyebrows of Doom, of course! And he&#39;s even supposed to look a bit like movie!Elrond. It all fits! {X D<br><br>Hm, yeah, Jay and Acacia the writers would probably be the headmistresses. Doesn&#39;t mean Jay and Acacia the characters wouldn&#39;t still take a role, though. As the coordinators, maybe? &#39;Twould be a departure from the norm, in which the avatars of the OFU writers are the coordinators, but this whole thing is a little abnormal. The PPC setting is interesting for an OFU because of how meta it already is. Half the characters already know they&#39;re characters even if they don&#39;t always like to think about it, and they know about fanfiction and OFUs. That&#39;s bound to make a difference in how things are done.<br><br>I did not catch Lemony. Huh. Avlates really isn&#39;t a fan, is she? I intended for them to come across as playfully condescending, a little bit trollish, but basically friendly. And also of ambiguous gender. (I personally am not sure whether Lem&#39;s a woman or a gay guy or something else.) But a careless fanwriter might well miss those details. Once Lem twigs that that&#39;s supposed to be them, though, they&#39;ll have something to say about it!<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>((Nume the lit teacher? At what level? Did he get very far in setting himself up for it, or was it more of a plan for the more distant future?<br><br>Yeah, the PPC is...not the typical canon. I&#39;ve also now got the lovely mental image of the Reader staring down a classroom and then going &quot;Nope&quot; and heading for the door. (Whether she gets out it or another Time Lord drags her back in is up in the air. The class is probably Time Lords of HQ...for short. The official title, provided by the Notary, is much longer and more pompous. The entire Continuity Council is meant to be teaching it in shifts. This...goes about as well as you&#39;d expect, although almost all of them gain a new appreciation for the Notary after they see her going on at the students instead of at them for once. It&#39;s probably dispelled at the next Council meeting.)<br><br>I&#39;m now *also* thinking of how the PPC OFU got set up. I mean, can&#39;t you just see a group of agents and Flowers arguing over what should go in, and how, and &#39;I saw them do it this way at OFWho&#39; and &#39;No, they did it much better at OFUM&#39; and &#39;What about OFUDisc, they have this one class that could really--&#39; and so on. I mean, there are OFU *graduates* in the PPC. And former OFU liaisons and co-coordinators and so on. They&#39;d have a lot to say, wouldn&#39;t they?<br><br>As to Lemony...huh. I...hm.<br><br>It&#39;s not so much that Avlates isn&#39;t a fan as that I misread a bit of what you wrote for them and then maybe didn&#39;t really get across what I was thinking when writing. I had the impression that Lemony was less playful in their condescension, certainly; what I was going for was a sort of discomfort over most of the people in the crowd and...yeah, basically, I was off. Guess the Lemony in Tofu Hop, at least on my part, is now a weird caricature! Oh dear. IIRC, I was kind of intending them to be the &#39;straight man&#39; (no pun intended): the person who can recognize canon and good writing a little better than half the student body, and who kind of disapproves. Although it&#39;s actually more the &quot;Oh, *honey*&quot; kind of disapproval, isn&#39;t it?<br><br>Well. Good to know. Can&#39;t get everything right, can we? Especially in the Badfic Games. So...whoops, and I now look forward to a nice argument with Lemony Eggnog...<br><br>~Z<br><br>PS: I&#39;m about half an hour of actual energy away from writing an interlude titled &quot;Continuity: Pedagogy.&quot; Help?))</p>

Gender is a largely artificial social construct used to force people into prescribed roles that may or may not actually suit them for the sole purpose of making it simpler for the privileged to control the disadvantaged. Who needs it?<br><br>Students: But... uh... bwuh? O.o<br><br>Lemony: *sigh* Just stick with &quot;they/them&quot; if you&#39;re not sure. It won&#39;t hurt, I promise.<br><br><br>...

            <p>((For my part, it&#39;s meant to be reasonably good (if unedited), but a little bit (to a lot) off my normal style. For instance, I wouldn&#39;t normally go straight for &quot;like an anime character&quot;, but here I thought of it and just went for it. So...expect more cliches and little to no editing? And less regard for good story flow/some characterisation details/better word choice? I mean, I am trying to get the agents in character, but it&#39;s working from memory rather than from going and rereading and getting a beta or two to catch things that sound a bit off.<br><br>Hm. Essentially, I think I&#39;m aiming for &quot;relatively good but somewhat careless in places.&quot; Low effort, basically, which makes sense for the Avlates persona&#39;s resultant style (even though at her age--which is older teenager--and at DuskWater&#39;s--younger teenager, maybe fourteen or fifteen--I did spend a ton of time editing most things I posted. Which is part of why a lot of what I wrote stayed on my computer, most likely.<br><br>Anyway. I&#39;m glad you&#39;re enjoying it :) It was very fun to do.<br><br>Now I just need to finish the next chapters of the two fics I started posting last week, not to mention the third thing I came up with...though at least that one&#39;s probably a oneshot.<br><br>(Self advertising, what self advertising?

Possibly actual lines of his from the past...? Hmm. Not sure. Probably won&#39;t remember anytime soon, either, unfortunately). And JayBird just kind of sprang into being fully-fledged. She&#39;s pretty easy to imagine.<br><br>And hm, I&#39;d forgotten about that story. I also hadn&#39;t quite realized it was canon, so, good to know.

Remember?”<br> <br>“Har har.” Kaitlyn found her bookmark and got to her feet. “But seriously, there was a second beep – you heard that, right?”<br> <br>“Maybe it was an echo,” Selene suggested, tabbing through to the mission details. “Wouldn’t surprise me in this place. Right, looks like we’re heading to-“<br> <br>“It wasn’t an echo,” Kaitlyn interrupted, frowning. “It came from…” She knelt down and peered under the table.<br> <br>Selene sighed. “I’ll just sort it out myself, then.”<br> <br>There was a <i>thud</i> from the table, and then, “Ow. Selene, there’s a <i>thing</i> under here.”<br> <br>“I’d imagine there is,” Selene agreed. “Probably lots of things. Is it a) alive, b) threatening, or c) amusing?”<br> <br>Kaitlyn crawled back out and got to her feet. “See for yourself,” she said, dusting herself off.<br> <br>Selene gave her a level look. “I’m not doing that.”<br> <br>“Yeah, you are.” Kaitlyn grinned. “It may take a bit of persuasion, but you’ll-“<br> <br>[beeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeep]<br> <br>Selene grumbled and tapped the button again, but the tone carried on for several seconds. When it stopped, she sighed, got to her feet, and walked over.<br> <br>Kaitlyn beamed at her. “Told you.”<br> <br>Muttering to herself, Selene bend down and looked into the darkness. There was a long pause, and then she glanced back at her partner. “There’s nothing there.”<br><br>Kaitlyn arched an eyebrow. &quot;Yeah there is.&quot;<br><br>&quot;No,&quot; said Selene, standing up, &quot;there isn&#39;t.&quot;<br><br>&quot;There <i>is</i>,&quot; Kaitlyn insisted. &quot;It was a little silver box covered in lights. It looked kind of like a console, but… small.&quot;<br><br>The vampire shrugged. &quot;A reflection, maybe?&quot; she suggested, glancing around. Her gaze lighted on the far corner of the room. &quot;Or… Kaitlyn, are you sure you were looking the right way?&quot;<br><br>Kaitlyn snorted. &quot;Well, <i>ob</i>viousl- <i>how did it get there</i>?&quot;<br><br>She stalked across the room, scowling her finest scowl. The device huddled between a bookshelf and a weapons cabinet did indeed look much like a console; its chrome surfaces gleamed, and the main screen was lit by a pulsating glow.<br><br>&quot;This,&quot; Kaitlyn said, jabbing a finger at it, &quot;wasn&#39;t here. It was under the table.&quot;<br><br>Selene shook her head, smiling slightly. &quot;How long has it been since you&#39;ve slept?&quot; she asked. &quot;You can&#39;t run on mushroom fumes forever.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Cheeky.&quot; Kaitlyn squatted down and peered at the console. &quot;It&#39;s got real buttons and everything. What do you think it is?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Probably another DIA monitoring device,&quot; Selene said, wandering over. &quot;Can we get on with our mission? We don&#39;t want the Hyacinth on our-&quot;<br><br>[beep]<br><br>Kaitlyn swung back around, pointing an accusing finger at the device. &quot;It beeped! You heard that, right?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Obviously.&quot; Selene bent over the miniature console. &quot;Perhaps a warning against getting too close?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I was closer than this under the table,&quot; Kaitlyn disagreed, &quot;and it-&quot;<br><br>[beep]<br><br>&quot;Stop that!&quot; She glowered at the device. &quot;I&#39;d swear it&#39;s deliberately interrup-&quot;<br><br>[beep]<br><br>&quot;Oh come on!&quot;<br><br>Selene sighed and turned away. &quot;Whatever it is, it can wait,&quot; she said. &quot;Mission. Come on.&quot;<br><br>Kaitlyn gave the miniature console one last deeply suspicious look, then got to her feet. &quot;I suppose you&#39;re right,&quot; she said, walking back towards the main console. &quot;It&#39;s going to bug me all mission, though. I wonder who put it th-&quot;<br><br>[beeeeeeeeeeep]<br><br>&quot;Oh, quiet, you.&quot; Kaitlyn glanced over her shoulder, and her eyes widened. &quot;Hey. <i>Hey</i>! Where--? Selene, where&#39;d it go?&quot;<br><br><hr>

So she landed in a corridor and said to the Daisy (A/N not teh markee but the ohter dassy whos&#39;e allays standining cordirors and suck) &quot;Why am I here?&quot; and the Daisy said <i>Because you&#39;ve been chosen to come to Tofu Hop,</i> and Tallulah said, &quot;What&#39;s Tofu Hop? It sounds like a game,&quot; but the Daisy said <i>It&#39;s not a game, COME WITH ME and you&#39;ll see.</i><br><br>So the Daisy led Tallulah (A/N THERE ELLZ ANDA HAITCH ive bene watching doctro who can yuo telll?????) to the Not As Big As The Big Auditorium But Bigger Than The Small Auditorium Auditorium, and who should she see there, but... the SUNFLOWER OFFICIAL! And she ran up to him and gave him a hug because he&#39;s so awesome. <i>Thank you, Tallulah Greensleeves,</i> said the Sunflower Official (A/N: omng he is SO NISE), <i>but please take your seat so we can get started.</i><br><br>Tallulah looked back at the seats to find they were all full of FANGIRLS, and there was one with her name on it (A/N: writting in ELFISH LETTETERS), so she went to it and she sat down. &quot;Hello,&quot; she said to the girl on her left, &quot;I&#39;m Tallulah Greensleeves and I&#39;m Legolas&#39; sister from Mirkwood, and I&#39;m not just an elf but also a mermaid, and I grew up with Frodo and Sam, who live together because they&#39;re gay and that&#39;s fine, and also I went to the same school as Strider who is also called Aragorn.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Hi,&quot; said the girl next to her, who had black and gold hair and pointy ears, &quot;I&#39;m Jessaminthe Layla Windflower Evenstar (A/N: Jessaminthe is righten by MrsSupernumerary and shes&#39; RILLY COOLL), I&#39;m Arwen&#39;s sister and Elrond&#39;s daughter and the princess of Rivendell.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Cool,&quot; said Tallulah, and she turned to the girl on her right. &quot;Hello,&quot; she said, &quot;I&#39;m Tallulah Greensleeves and I&#39;m Legolas&#39; sister from Mirkwood, and I&#39;m not just an elf but also a mermaid, and I grew up with Frodo and Sam, who live together because they&#39;re gay and that&#39;s fine, and also I went to the same school as Strider who is also called Aragorn.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Ugh,&quot; said the girl on her right, who had black and pink hair, spitting on her, &quot;I&#39;m Morana Kristine Stephanie Hecate King (A/N MorONa is righten by NightmareTwisteyTheDemonFoxAnimatronic who is EFIL and a PLAJJERIS so DONT@T REED HER SOTRYS), I&#39;m a 16-year-old girl with black-and-pink hair reaching to just below my boobs and shiny pink eyes, and <i>I hate you</i>.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Well, that isn&#39;t very nice,&quot; said Tallulah. &quot;Why do you hate me?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Because I hate everything which is nice,&quot; said Morana, spitting on her again.<br><br>Tallulah was about to say something which would make Morana feel very bad for what she was saying, but then the Sunflower Official spoke again. <i>Hello, fans of the PPC,</i> he said. <i>As you know, I am the Sunflower Official-</i><br><br>&quot;Yaaaaaay!&quot; shouted Tallulah.<br><br><i>Thank you, Tallulah,</i> said the Sunflower Official. <i>You&#39;re really nice; can I call you Tally?</i><br><br>&quot;Of course!&quot; shouted Tallulah. &quot;Can I call you Sunny?&quot;<br><br><i>I would be flattered,</i> said the Sunflower Official. <i>Now, fans of the PPC,</i> he said, <i>I&#39;m sure you know that there has been a lot of bad fanfiction about the PPC.</i><br><br>Morana cackled. &quot;And lots of it is MINE!&quot;<br><br><i>Precisely. When there was a lot of bad fanfic of Lord of the Rings, Miss Cam started OFUM to deal with it. Well, now we are doing the same thing.</i> The Sunflower Official waves his leaves, and lots of other Flowers and Agents came up onto the stage. There was the Bonsai Mallorn and the Marquis de Sod and the Lichen, and also there was Dafydd Illian and Supernumberary and Suicide and even Jay and Acacia.<br><br>&quot;Wow!&quot; said Jessaminthe next to Tallulah. &quot;They&#39;re all so dreamy!

And they were waiting for the third person who would sleep in their room. &quot;Which classes are you looking forward to?&quot; said Jessaminthe.<br><br>Tallulah looked at her timetable, which was written in Elvish writing (A/N b/cus shes&#39;an EFL so ist CANNUN taht she reeds elfis i. tihnk abut cannun alot yuo knoe). &quot;I like the look of &#39;How To Be A Department Head&#39;, by the Sunflower Official,&quot; she said, &quot;and also &#39;How To Not Be Human&#39; by Illian the blue horse thing (A/N 4got teh name sozzzzzy!).&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yes,&quot; said Tallulah, &quot;I like those too. But I&#39;m most interested in &#39;How To Be The Best Agent&#39;, but it doesn&#39;t have a teacher listed, I wonder why that is?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; said Jessaminthe, &quot;but we&#39;ll find out today. Look - it&#39;s our first class!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Good!&quot; stated Tallulah. &quot;What do you want to do until then? We could go and play pranks on people.&quot;<br><br>&quot;But who would we play them on?&quot; asked Jessaminthe. &quot;Everyone in the PPC is so dreamy.&quot;<br><br>Tallulah thought about the agents she knew about. &quot;What about Suicide?&quot; she asked. &quot;His name sounds bad.&quot;<br><br>&quot;He&#39;s super-dreamy,&quot; said Jessaminthe. &quot;He&#39;s only called that because so many girls have committed suicide when he rejected them, which he did for good reasons.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Oh,&quot; said Tallulah, &quot;I was wrong.&quot; (A/N: SEA?? shes&#39; can&#39;t be an Mery-Sud bec/s seh gts stuffv wrogn!!)<br><br>&quot;That&#39;s all right,&quot; said Jessaminthe, &quot;you&#39;re still very beautiful.&quot;<br><br>Tallulah didn&#39;t think she was, but she didn&#39;t say anything because Jessaminthe always said that and it was no good arguing with her. &quot;Maybe we could prank the other students?&quot; she suggested. &quot;What about Ruby and Kitty (A/N SHOTUOUT too deadpassion1479)?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Oh I think they are having sex in the next room,&quot; said Jessaminthe. &quot;I can tell because of all the shouting.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Oh,&quot; said Tallulah. &quot;Then what about-&quot;<br><br>At that moment the door swung open and the two girls looked round and an arrow shot between them and hit the wall and bounced off and NEARLY HIT TALLULAH only it didn&#39;t but the girls didn&#39;t get a chance to notice that because who should be standing in their door but...<br><br>&quot;MORANA KRISTINE STEPHANIE HECATE KING!&quot; shouted Tallulah and Jessaminthe at the same time, and then Tallulah said, &quot;What are you doing here?&quot;<br><br>Morana pulled out her archery things again and shot another arrow past Tallulah. &quot;Oops,&quot; she said, &quot;my hand slipped.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Maybe it wouldn&#39;t have if you hadn&#39;t been in our room,&quot; said Tallulah (A/N WAT A COMBECK am i wright?!?!?!).<br><br>&quot;Oh, but I&#39;m not,&quot; said Morana evilly, stepping through the door and putting her things down and pinning her posters on the walls and putting her bag on the best bed and resetting the alarm clock to TOO EARLY and turning the radio to her music which was bad music. &quot;I&#39;m in <i>my</i> room... and I&#39;m sharing with you!&quot;<br><br>~#~#~#~#~<br><br>A/N borroed som more carries!! aslo MorONa istill efil and NOBBYDY REED HER SOTRIES.<br><br>((Did you spot it?

            <p>A/N: NO REVUEWS?!?!?!!? comon ppl!!1<br><br>~#~~#~#~<br><br>LUCKILY just as Morana was about to do some bad things (A/N: yewll have to imganine them your&#39;e sefl), the console played a tune that meant it was time to go to their first class. So Tallulah and Jessaminthe walked down the corridor while Morana stalked behind them, until they found the BBQ Courtyard (A/N: ical it taht b/c Jay an Acacia had a barbiecue tehre that one tiem so now i Imigine its&#39; offisialy cald that) where they found all the other students at Tofu Hop waiting. &quot;Hi everyone, how are you, and also is this the class for How To Be The Best Agent?&quot; asked Tallulah.<br><br>&quot;Hi,&quot; said Terry Pratchett (A/N ANOTTER of xXth0th999Xx &#39;s OCss!!!1 seh is SOO TALTENED!!), &quot;I am fine, and yes, it is.&quot;<br><br>&quot;That&#39;s cool,&quot; said Tallulah, as she waved at the other students she recognised like Captain Deadly and Ruby and Kitty (A/N :YES i remimberd they wer in tihs.). &quot;So where is the teacher?&quot;<br><br><i>She will be here very soon, Tally,</i> said the Sunflower Official who was also there. <i>Now, I know you can restrain yourself, but I want everyone else to remember that tackling your teachers is frowned upon unless you&#39;re in a consensual relationship with them (A/N: red taht somewehre, not sur waht it mees buti geuss its&#39; improtante?!).</i><br><br>&quot;Okay,&quot; said all the students, except Morana because she was evil. And Tallulah was going to point out to the Sunflower Official (who she would have called Sunny), but AT THAT MOMENT a portal (A/N: oneo f the porper pink ons) opened and who should step out but...<br><br>... a 5 foot girl with blonde hair dyed dark red-blown and blue eyes. She had black boots and a black shirt that showed her stomach, and also a skirt.<br><br>&quot;I don&#39;t know who that is,&quot; whispered Jessaminthe to Tallulah, &quot;should I know who that is?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Hi!&quot; said the girl, waving. &quot;I&#39;m Aurora E. Lorra, and don&#39;t worry, I&#39;m not your teacher, I&#39;m just here to check that everything&#39;s okay.&quot;<br><br><i>Everything is okay,</i> the Sunflower Official told her. <i>We made sure to tie Acacia back up after the first meeting so she can&#39;t attack anyone.</i><br><br>&quot;Okay good,&quot; said Aurora, as she stuck her head back through the portal. &quot;It&#39;s okay to come through!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Thank you, my friend,&quot; said a voice, and ALL THE STUDENTS gasped when they heard it (even Morana), because who should step out of the portal next but...<br><br>THE ONE AND ONLY JAYCACIA THORNBYRD!!!!!<br><br>~#~#~#~#~<br><br>A/N: i knooooooooooh!!!!!! kk so i know i Havn&#39;et finised &#39;Darkheart &amp; Lightheart&#39; yte, but tihs tackes plase after taht.. neway i couldn ressit bringe Jaycacia inot tish tory two<br><br><hr>

Rome doesn&#39;t know how to do it properly.&quot; She wiped the crumbs away on the back of her hand. &quot;Anyway, how&#39;s things?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Kind of rotten.&quot; Jay tapped her fingers on the newspaper. &quot;It&#39;s all doom and gloom and occasional superstorms. What about you?&quot;<br><br>&quot;About what you&#39;d expect,&quot; Acacia said with a shrug. &quot;The Emperor&#39;s found a new war to play with, so everyone&#39;s rattling on about how great conquering things is.&quot;<br><br>Jay sighed. &quot;Some things never change.&quot; She swiped her mug back from Acacia and drained it. &quot;So what brings you to these par- uh, years?&quot;<br><br>Acacia tugged a sheaf of printouts from her bag and dropped it on top of Jay&#39;s paper. &quot;What do you think?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Ah.&quot; Jay tilted her head to the side, trying to read. &quot;More of that thing where you&#39;re an evil baby?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Nope; better.&quot; Acacia tapped the title. &quot;She&#39;s ripping off Miss Cam now.&quot;<br><br>&quot;... an OFU? </i>Seriously<i>?

HER.&quot;<br><br>Tallulah followed Jessaminthe&#39;s finger until it pointed at... &quot;Morana Kristine Stephanie Hecate King!&quot; Tallulah gasped. &quot;What do you think she did?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I think we are about to find out,&quot; Jessaminthe said. &quot;Look - Jaycacia is talking again!&quot;<br><br>Indeed she was. &quot;The reason I am not glad to see you all,&quot; said the PPC&#39;s most famous (and best) agent, &quot;is because... you&#39;re not supposed to be here!&quot;<br><br>&quot;THAT&#39;S NOT TRUE!&quot; Everyone turned round to look as someone new stormed into the classroom. She had blonde hair, dip-dyed red, bound up in a high ponytail. She stormed down the stairs and stormed up to Jaycacia. &quot;I am Calamity Megaera Skadi Roxelana Hellfire,&quot; she announced, &quot;and I say you ARE supposed to be here - everyone one of you!&quot;<br><br>&quot;That&#39;s very nice,&quot; said Jaycacia, &quot;but I&#39;m pretty sure I&#39;m the teacher here, and also the person who suggested the idea of Tofu Hop to my husband, so I think I know better.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Or do you?&quot; Calamity pointed into the audience, and her finger went the same way as Jessaminthe&#39;s had. &quot;Morana!&quot; she called. &quot;Everything is working perfectly!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Of course!&quot; Morana cackled evilly. &quot;You ridiculous fangirls don&#39;t have the first idea what&#39;s happening here! It was MY portal that brought you here - mine and my lover Calamity&#39;s!&quot; Calamity blew her a kiss across the room. &quot;We&#39;re the only evil fangirls who are SUPPOSED to be at this university - but now all of you are here as well! And unless you can stop me now, you will ALL have to suffer through the worst punishments an OFU has to offer!&quot;<br><br>There was a gasp from everyone in the crowd. Then four people moved at once. Captain Deadly in his army uniform jumped up onto the chairs to run towards Morana, but was knocked back by her black magickckck (which was more evil than Luxury&#39;s black magickckck). Jessaminthe turned into a wolf and called a storm to attack Morana, which she could do because of the Windflower Legacy, but Morana jumped out of the way of her and ducked. Jaycacia tried to use her powers to make Morana go away, but Calamity got in the way and vanished instead (and good riddance!!!).<br><br>And Tallulah Greensleeves used her mermaid speed to duck UNDER the chairs, grab Morana by the legs, and pull her down to the floor!<br><br>&quot;No!&quot; screamed Morana as she fell. &quot;This cannot be! I am invincible!&quot;<br><br>&quot;No you&#39;re not,&quot; quipped Tallulah, and killed her.<br><br>&quot;Well done,&quot; said a voice, and Tallulah looked up to see Jaycacia standing above her. &quot;You have saved Tofu Hop - but at the same time you have made Tofu Hop unnecessary, because you have just killed the only evil fangirl (except for Calamity but I killed her). So now we can disband the university and you can go home.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Oh,&quot; said Tallulah, happy but also sad. &quot;But I like it in PPC HQ.&quot;<br><br>Jaycacia bubbled with laughter. &quot;Then you can stay!&quot; she stated. &quot;And all your friends can stay too!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yaaaaaaay!&quot; said Tallulah, giving Jessaminthe a hug. &quot;Now we will never have to be apart again!&quot;<br><br>THEEND<br><br>~#~#~#~#~<br><br>A/N: i jsut wat to mack it clear taht evn tohug MorONa and Calamity are lebsians, tahs not becase lebsins are evl! tehyr&#39; atcually verr nise!!!1<br><br>aslo i was gonig to wright moar but ijus MOVD HOUSE soI was bussy. hopp you enjyod the sotry!!!!1<br><br>~JayBird@<br><br><hr>

            <p>There <i>is</i> a good idea in here - I like that the PPC has its own OFU, it seems like the sort of thing they&#39;d do - but your writing style is atrocious to the point that it&#39;s nearly unreadable. The Sunflower Official simply <i>isn&#39;t like this</i>, and I have to ask: did you request to use Morana in any manner, let alone this one? Not that one has to, of course, but it&#39;s only polite.<br><br>Like I said at the start, this really does have a lot of potential, if it was written by someone else. Anyone else. Lemony. Avlates_usted. A small lump of green putty I found in my armpit one fine summer morning. <i>Anyone</i>. Yes, there are some bits that are amusing - the transition into legible English to mark the transition into HQ from Tallulah&#39;s homefic is a nice touch, I like the Not As Big As The Big Auditorium But Bigger Than The Small Auditorium Auditorium (someone&#39;s been at the Feegles) - but overall, it&#39;s a really garbled mess of a fic. It&#39;s like gumbo made by a blind idiot from Stevenage in a kitchen full of bicycle parts.</p>

            <p>Disclaimers and stuff: All right, I obviously don&#39;t own any characters here. This fic is rated 18, or M in Freedomland. Not going to be explicit (it&#39;s not as explicit as Scape&#39;s masterpiece), but it&#39;s not hard to figure out what&#39;s going on here. You&#39;ve been warned.<br><br>---------------------------------------------<br><br>Zeb padded into the Courtyard luxuriantly as his wonderful soft luxuriant fur had just been carefully washed by his partner. He gazed over the lush green grass, the verdant trees, and the sparkling blue water beforewalking into the center of the area to lie down and wait for someone to show up<br><br>It was at that time coincidentally that Ix wwalkec inn and Zeb as always wondered what happened for him to get all those scars across his face and stuff. Ix took a few steps into the Courtyared, looking up at the sky, and let out a shriek of internal pain and agony baring out her soul to any who could hear. Zeb bounced over as was his way.<br><br>&quot;Hey, Ix!&quot; Zeb bounced &quot;Whatup?&quot;<br><br>Ix smiled despite himself because it&#39;s impossible to be sad and angsty when confronted with a happy luxray. &quot;oh Zeb&quot; he said &quot;I&#39;m just so unhappy all the time and Charlotte is just smothering me in her protective awesomeness! I can&#39;t deserve her so I&#39;m out here alone instead of doing whatever in the RC.&quot;<br><br>Zeb nodded sagely, still bouncing around. “Well do you want a distraction or something? I can go fetch stuff like sticks!”<br><br>“Sure” Ix said and tackleglomped Zeb petting him and his beautiful silky fur all over and started tearing his clothes off to reveal more beautiful scars which Zeb wasted no time in licking sensually. Eventually the two pulled away, breathless. “Wow that was great,” Ix said. “I barely feel terrible and angsty now!”<br><br>“Good!” Zeb replied. “I’m told I have a way of rubbing off on people like that.”<br><br>“You certainly do.”<br><br>It was then that Zeb had an idea, an idea to do something he’d always wanted to do since getting blown up and winding up in the PPC. Before long, both Agents were having lots of fun, rolling in the grass of the Courtyard and ending up with Zeb standing over the almost-Auror as the sun was setting, painting the sky with a dazzling array of oranges and golden yellows and other similarly gem- and precious metal-inspired colors.<br><br><br>And Ix screamed into the sky, tears of pure joy and pleasure streaming down his face,<br><br><br><br>“OHHHHHHHH ZEBBIE-KUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUNNNNNNNNNNN~~~~~”<br><br></p>

            <p>Dear gods, what hath I wrought? <i>¿Por qué? ¿Por queeeé?!</i><br><br>No, for real though, I am conflicted. On the one hand, actually decent writing! It doesn&#39;t hurt my eyes, and the porn itself, while naturally YMMV according to taste, does not straight-up hurt my brain, either. Like, I&#39;m not into cat peens, and I&#39;m not sure they work quite the way you think they do, but you do you!<br><br>On the other hand, the characters are still painfully OOC, your lemon is a tad purple (which is not a healthy color for lemons!), and the last paragraph made me laugh. This is not a good thing. First, that is a terrible, awful, no good, very bad joke about poor Zeb, and you should be ashamed! Second, buckets of it, seriously? *giggle snort* And finally, are you telling me Zeb&#39;s <i>eau de vie</i> contains some sort of anesthetic? That&#39;s... that&#39;s a nice feature, that is, I admit, but come on. XD You just couldn&#39;t keep a straight face on it, could you?<br><br>But still, I must congratulate you. I was thoroughly over-the-top ridiculous at you, and you called my bluff and made something I can honestly call half-decent. Kudos!<br><br>--Lemony<br><br>(( I&#39;m not sorry and I&#39;m not apologizing! {X D Unless Ix is actually mad, in which case I will.<br><br>(( And once again, the Badfic Game gets more M-rated toward the end. ))</p>

            <p>[[AN: AUGH. You wake up the next morning and discover that you&#39;ve posted to FFW drunk. Apologies for that nonsense. The following story will be up to my usual standards of quality.]]<br><br>The Aviator walked into Rudis and sat down at the bar. &quot;Grr. I am sad and angsty,&quot; she said, in a sad and angsty. She then burst into tears and started crying. She took out some black paint and started painting her face.<br><br>&quot;Oh shut up,&quot; said Acacia, who was sitting nearby. &quot;If you keep crying like that, I&#39;ll stab you.&quot;<br><br>At this point, The Head of the PPC, Mr. Sunflower, walked in the bar. Everyone in the bar bowed. &quot;Good news!&quot; he said. &quot;I just sent out all the paychecks, and we&#39;ve done such a good job you can all get a two weeks vacation!&quot;<br><br>Everyone cheered, except Agent Selene. She wished she could spend more time doing her job.<br><br>Just then, Thoth walked in. &quot;I just loosed a bunch of Genestealers all over HQ. Jave fun dealing with that!&quot;<br><br>&quot;But why would you do that?&quot; Asked Agent Cameo. &quot;It doesn&#39;t benefit you at all?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Because,&quot; said Thoth, &quot;I&#39;m evil! Do you think I need a reason? MUAHAHAHAHAHAHA!&quot;<br><br>Just then, Tom hit Thoth in the back of his head with a crowbar. &quot;Sorry about that. Come on...&quot; He dragged Thoth back to the RC by his T-shirt.<br><br>Then Jay showed up and punched Acacia in the face. This started a barfight, which stopped why Terry Pratchett entered the room.<br><br>&quot;But what are you doing here?&quot; asked Jay.<br><br>&quot;Didn&#39;t you know? I&#39;m secretly an agent.&quot; said Terry. He then gave them all copies of the 50th Discworld novel, causing most of the participants in the fight to become so focused on reading that they stopped fighting.<br><br>Then the author of this fic walked into the room and was immediately shot by  Agent Zeb for writing something this stupid.</p>

            <p>Summary: I decided to try something different. Ave/Dee.<br><br>The Aviator was in her TARDIS, cleaning up after having put Elanor to bed. Suddenly, the Detective walked in!<br><br>&quot;Aah!&quot;, the Aviator shouted, scared, &quot;How did you get in here?&quot;<br><br>&quot;The front door.&quot; said the Detective.<br><br>&quot;What do you want?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Remember that one time we did some stuff when we were drunk?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yep!&quot; said Ave. &quot;It was fun!&quot;<br><br>&quot;It sure was.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Did you want to do it again?&quot;. The Aviator, who&#39;d already taken most of her clothes off to be more comfortable clearing, started to take off the rest of them.<br><br>The Detective blushed. &quot;Uh ... yeah. I did. &#39;s why I came here.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Cool. It&#39;s great that you came by again. I&#39;ve needed to get in another relationship after my last boyfriend died in the war.&quot;<br><br>Ave then shrugged dismissively and said, a bit quieter, &quot;Between you and me, he was kind of lame. Not like you.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Awww, thanks!&quot; The Detective was a bit surprised that anyone was saying that sort of stuff about him, and tried not to show it. It didn&#39;t work out very well.<br><br>The Aviator looked towards the bedroom, and then realized something. &quot;We can&#39;t have sexytimes here?!&quot; she said suddenly. &quot;We&#39;d wake Elanor!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Damm. That sucks.&quot; said Dee, rather disappointed. &quot;Maybe later, then.&quot;. He started walking away.<br><br>On his way out of the room, he remembered something. &quot;Wait! My TARDIS has a spare bedroom! Maybe yours does too?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I dunno. Let&#39;s go look?&quot;<br><br>And so the two lovers went off in search of the spare bedroom, holding hands. Fortunately, thanks to Ave&#39;s expert navigational skills (which were so good that she could find places in Headquarters while trying to get there), they found it in about a minute, even though it was halfway across the TARDIS.<br><br>They went in, and Dee started to take off his clothes too. Both the Time Lords got into bed, and started off with several rounds of passionate snuggling and kissing. After a good hour or so of that, they put the legendary Time Lord stamina to work. They spent the next day or so plowing each other relentlessly, thereby setting off a whole new round of speculation in the Multiverse Monitor about Elanor&#39;s parentage.<br><br>Somewhere in the middle of a pile of all these goings-on whose detailed description would bump the rating too much for this website, Ave turned to the Detective and squealed &quot;Oh my god, I love you!&quot;<br><br>&quot;I love you too, Ave!&quot;<br><br>&quot;We should get married! Elanor already thinks you&#39;re her dad, we might as well make it official. And then we can do this every night!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Sounds like a great plan! We can do that after we get tired of this!&quot;<br><br>They then got back to screwing.<br><br>Eventually, the two bleary Time Lords, faces glowing with happiness, stumbled out of bed. They took a shower (together, obviously) and then put their clothes on. Then, they started heading out of the TARDIS so they could portal to Vegas and get the wedding over with.<br><br>As they were leaving, they saw Zeb, who was sniffing the air.<br><br>&quot;Ave! Dee! You were mating, weren&#39;t you?&quot; he asked, teasing.<br><br>&quot;Yeah! And we&#39;re getting married! Want to come?&quot; the Aviator said, excited.<br><br>&quot;Duh! What took you two so long? You&#39;re perfect for each other!&quot;<br><br>Both Time Lords looked at each other and shrugged. &quot;Dunno.&quot; they said, nearly in unison.<br><br>The new couple (and Zeb) then left the TARDIS and started fiddling with the portal generator.<br><br>A/N: To be continued? Maybe. Depends on if I get reviews.</p>

            <p>Time Enough For Love Ch. 2<br><br>A/N: Thanks for the reviews everyone! You ready for wedding shenanigans?<br><br>The Aviator, the Detective, and Zeb were all standing in front of a portal set for Las Vegas ... sort of. It was a version of Vegas that was basically the real Vegas, but they wouldn&#39;t mind marrying two Time Lords with a Pokemon as the witness.<br><br>The Aviator was about to step through the portal when she took a step back. &quot;Wait, why aren&#39;t we doing this on Gallifrey?&quot;<br><br>The Detective waved a hand dismissively. &quot;Too traditional. The ceremony would take, like, hours, and I want to get back to shagging you. Also, Vegas is traditional for drunken weddings!&quot;<br><br>&quot;B-b-but I&#39;m not drunk!&quot; protested the Aviator.<br><br>&quot;Good point.&quot; said the Detective. &quot;We should fix that. Let&#39;s go to Rudi&#39;s.&quot;. He put a hand around the Aviator&#39;s showlders and led her out the door through the featureless gray corridors of HQ, with Zeb following behind them.<br><br>The trio got to the bar, which was rather loud and crowded. They managed to fight their way to the bar (with some strategically placed elbows), and the Aviator shouted &quot;Next few dozen rounds are on me, you too! I&#39;m getting married and I need to have fun and get too wasted to remember all that crap I usually angst about!&quot;<br><br>&quot;That&#39;s a great plan!&quot; said Zeb, who was rather excited to get to try actual alcohol. &quot;Why haven&#39;t you tried that before?&quot;<br><br>The Aviator muttered &quot;Dunno. Must&#39;ve never come up before.&quot; and started knocking back shots of whatever the bartender was putting in front of them. She didn&#39;t even keep an eye on the bill - being one of the most famous and decorated agents in HQ came with a <i>serious</i> paycheck.<br><br>After about three drinks, Zeb was rather unsteady and starting to shoot off sparks. &quot;Imm jush gonna go back t&#39; th Rshe.&quot; he slurred, wandering away from the bar. On his way out of Rudi&#39;s, a also rather inebriated cat-person caught his eye.<br><br>&quot;Hey. &#39;m Zeb. Y&#39;know, the Aviator&#39;s partner?&quot; he introduced himself. &quot;Are you a Meouwh? It&#39;s kinda hard to tell, since there&#39;s four of you.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I&#39;m Za&#39;kiir.&quot; said said cat, holding out a paw. &quot;My partner&#39;s somewhere else, so I got pretty wasted on this sugar.&quot;&quot;<br><br>Zeb shook the paw. &quot;Ave&#39;s still over there getting drunk before she gets married in Vegas. I&#39;m a bit out of it, so I left.. Sort of disappointed I didn&#39;t get involved in the mating at all though.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Hmm...&quot;, thought the cat. &quot;Khajjit could show you a good time, if you&#39;d like.&quot;<br><br>Zeb blushed. &quot;Hell yeah!&quot; he said, arcing all over. Then, the two agents went off into a dark corner of the pub and had a very good time. (A/N: I can&#39;t describe this very well because I have no idea how that could even work, but those two needed to get together!)<br><br>Meanwhile, the two Time Lords were getting to the point where they could actually feel the effects of the copious amounts of alcohol they were drinking. Both of them started telling kickass stories from the war to anyone who would listen, which obviously involved a lot of one-upping each other about how many Daleks they&#39;d obliterated. This got them a few new admirerers.<br><hr>
<br>Eventually, the about-to-be-married couple left the bar, just drunk enough to allow for an easy annulment the next day should the need arise. On their way out of the bar, they ran in to Zeb, who was leaving after having gotten to know (both as a person and in the Biblical sense) Za&#39;kiir. As the three of them started to walk back to the RC, Zeb was excitedly telling the other two about his new boyfriend and planning the second date.<br><br>Once they&#39;d reached the RC, everyone straightened up their clothes (or fur). Then, they took a few minutes to chase the pigeon that had wandered through the portal they&#39;d forgotten to close out into the hallway. This involved some innovative applications of a sonic screwdriver and a broomstick. After the pest problem was taken care of, everyone stepped through the portal and closed it behind them.<br><br>The Time Lords unsteadily walked into the nearby courthouse and told the clerk &quot;We&#39;re here to get married!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Great, go fill out this form.&quot; said the tentacled fellow behind the desk, passing over the paperwork.<br><br>When the form was almost complete, the Detective noticed something. &quot;Hey, uh, honey, we need two witnesses.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Darn. C&#39;n we use the clerk?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Says here we can&#39;t.&quot; said the Detective. Then he threw up his arms and started running around in a circle. &quot;WHAT DO WE DO!!??&quot; he panicked.<br><br>&quot;I&#39;ve got a plan. It&#39;s a great plan.&quot; said Ave. &quot;Give me the portal gun.&quot;<br><br>The Aviator then opened a portal right into Rudi&#39;s. She stepped through and went up to the bar. There, she spotted her best friend — OK, well it was actually someone she&#39;d just met at the pub a few hours back, but close enough — Serendipity Twenty-Nine.<br><br>&quot;Hey, Serendi-somethin&#39; — robot chick!&quot;<br><br>Serendipity glanced at the Aviator. &quot;What? I&#39;m busy moping about how I&#39;m going to lose my powers and plotting a revolution.&quot;<br><br>&quot;We need a second witness for the wedding. It&#39;ll only be a few minutes. Can you come?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Ugh. fine. But you owe me one.&quot; grumbled the robot, standing up.<br><br>Ave then opened a portal back into court, and the two of them stepped through. Everyone signed the form, which took a few minutes since Galiffreyan signatures are pretty long, and handed it in to get a marriage license. Some psychic paper served just fine as valid ID for the four of them, so that wasn&#39;t an issue either.<br><br>After all the government junk was dealt with, the Aviator and the Detective had a long, multi-minute embrace and kiss.<br><br>Somewhere around the twentieth minute, Serendipity figured out which city they were in. Her eyes turned red. &quot;Is this a <i>human</i> city? I <b>hate</b> humans!&quot; she shouted, charging up a rocket launcher.<br><br>The noise startled the newlyweds out of their passion. &quot;Put that down!&quot; shouted the Detective, opening up a portal to Ave&#39;s RC. &quot;We&#39;re all goin&#39; home. Me &#39;n Ave have some, y&#39;know, stuff, to get to.&quot;<br><br>The Aviator put an arm around Serendipity and the Detective. &quot;Yeah. Let&#39;s get out of here before security shows up. I don&#39;t like dealing with the paperwork for shooting people.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Ugh, that paperwork.&quot; muttered Serendipity, her eyes turning blue again. She put the gun back and stepped through the portal.<br><br>&quot;Bar&#39;s that way.&quot; said the Aviator to the android, pointing, after everyone had made it back to the RC. &quot;Third right, thes second left, then keep going straight until you reach it.&quot; Serendipity walked out the door, plotting revenge on humanity under her breath.<br><br>&quot;Hey, Zeb? Can you keep Elanor distracted while we enjoy our wedding night?&quot; asked the Aviator, opening the door into her TARDIS.<br><br>&quot;Sure! You two have fun!&quot; said the Pokemon, who&#39;d, unlike everyone else, sobered up by now.<br><br>The two Time Lords grabbed each others hands and walked deep into the TARDIS, where they found the bedroom they&#39;d used the day before. There, in a fit of passion, they ripped each others clothes off and got really busy trying to give Elanor a sibling. Their love grew so loud that several neighboring RCs filed noise complaints, and seismic disturbances were reported somewhere in Iowa because of the noise.<br><br>A/N: I&#39;ll keep writing as long as you keep encouraging me with those sweet, sweet reviews!</p>

            <p>(Note from the Original, Non-Suethor Version Of This Author:<br><br>This fic may end up being NSFW and/or NSFB. I&#39;m not sure exactly where to go with it. It features Sued versions of some agent ideas I had recently, along with some of the more famous agents made by other people functioning as the Sues&#39; punching bags or adoring fans. I have particularly mischievous plans for a few of the male agents... TuT But anyway! Let&#39;s go, then!)<br><br>----<br>The New Recruit<br><br>---Prologue---<br><br><i>As I slept in my luxurious bed in my sweet home town of Las Vegas after a day of gambling (my parents let me do whatever I want), I had the most wonderful dream. I was standing in the middle of a beautiful, dark forest clearing underneath a huge, pure white full moon. Everything smelled of pine and aspen and maple and flowers too, like lavender and honeysuckle and pink roses, my favorite of all. In the clearing there was a small, still reflecting pool, surrounded by a short circle of rose bushes, and before it was a massive yellow sunflower that appeared to be watching me. It was wearing a robe of some sort. I approached the giant flower and stared at it in wonder, and a couple seconds later, it began to speak to me.</i><br><br>Tomorrow, you will come to a new world, <i>it said, its voice echoing through my brain.</i> Do not be afraid. You will discover new power within you, more than you&#39;ve ever dreamed of. <i>Then I felt my heart beating in every part of me with a strong, regular rhythm, and everything slowly went dark as the flower&#39;s last words faded away:</i><br><br>Feel... it... pulse...<br><br><i>I woke up falling.</i><br><br>---Chapter 1---<br><br>Hi, my name is Morana Kristine Stephanie Hecate King, and I&#39;m a 16-year-old girl with black-and-pink hair reaching to just below my boobs and shiny pink eyes. Usually before I came here I would wear blue contacts and say that my hair was dyed so that I wouldn&#39;t be mocked (and yes, some people found out and mocked me anyway), but once I came to the place where I belonged, I threw those suckers away! Of course, I still wear makeup, even though I look gorgeous without it, with my beautiful face and figure, because doing people&#39;s makeup is what I like best. I always wear clothes that make me look super cute, like right now I&#39;ve got on a black strapless top with a pink glittery skull on it, a short black skirt with a pink glittery belt, thigh-high black and pink striped stockings, and black lace-up boots with pink glittery lightning bolts on them. In terms of accessories, I also am wearing a pink light-up pendant necklace (ha, bet you didn&#39;t know those exist!), black wrist-guard thingies like Wonder Woman wears except black not gold, and my new jacket over my shoulders. Why&#39;d they have to make my department logo a cactus? That&#39;s so lame! A pink glittery broken heart would be better. Anyway, you can get a general image of me now, right? Aren&#39;t I hawt? Yeah, I know. <br><br>But that&#39;s not the point of the story, is it? I know you want some makeup tips from me, but I have to tell you about how I got to my favorite place ever, my new home. What is that? Well, let&#39;s go back to me falling. I was falling and falling and falling as I flailed my arms in a futile attempt to somehow get out of the hole I was in as my mind raced to figure out what was going on. Had I been sleepwalking? What was going on? Why wasn&#39;t I in my pajamas? Oh well, it seemed like in my sleep I&#39;d picked out my cutest outfit yet! Go me! I kept falling, and I fell faster and faster and faster. I was wondering when I was going to stop falling when I saw the ground approaching. The ground had tiles on it, and they were white and black. Why not pink? Wherever I was going needed a remodeling. And that&#39;s when I hit the ground, landing on my feet standing as I looked around the place. I appeared to be in some sort of office building, in a room with windows and doors. Surrounding me were many young adults in black jackets and the giant sunflower from my dream, except it was wearing the top half of a suit, as well as other huge flowers. Upon seeing me, they became excited, murmuring amongst themselves things like &quot;That&#39;s the one from the prophecy!&quot; and &quot;Looks like we have a new recruit.&quot; I awkwardly smiled, shrugging my shoulders, which caused them to burst into cheers. &quot;Welcome,&quot; said the sunflower. &quot;We&#39;ve been waiting for you.&quot;<br><br>-------<br><br>How&#39;d ya like it? I think it&#39;s a good start to a story! Plz review it! Reviews r my life! Except no flames. I haven&#39;t been flamed before - this is my first story - so I don&#39;t know what it&#39;s like, but I know that flamers are horrible, horrible people. Have a Foxytastic day!<br><br>-Nightmare Twistey the Demon Fox Animatronic</p>

            <p>Author&#39;s Note:<br><br>Okay, so this story hasn&#39;t been getting much attention lately in comparison to other fics like that stupid one written in a German accent. Why do people like it? It has no plot whatsoever, no suspense, no destiny, no magic powers, no entire-universe-is-at-stake, no cute outfits, just sex and more sex! Well, hmph! I can do better than that! I&#39;ll show everyone what a PPC fanfic really looks like!<br><br>Also, my story got flamed by somebody named Lemony Eggnog (quite an <i>unfortunate event</i>, I should say! Hahaha!) and all I can say is... Is that the best you&#39;ve got?! Or are all of you too scared to flame me because you know this fic is about to achieve greatness?! Hah! Cowards, all of you.<br><br>(Note from the Original:<br><br>My apologies to Lemony Eggnog. Thanks for the concrit! My apologies also to Ronion, who wrote the Biggen-brassen-whatever-en fic. I feel kinda guilty for finding your fic funny, but it is funny nonetheless.<br><br>-Twistey)<br><br>----<br><br>---Chapter 2---<br><br>&quot;Hello there, I guess,&quot; I replied to the sunflower, and the crowd quieted down. &quot;I&#39;m Morana... what is this place? Who are all of you?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Welcome to the headquarters of the Protectors of the Plot Continuum,&quot; said the sunflower, &quot;or the PPC for short. I am the Sunflower Official, the head of the entire business, and these are the agents.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Cool! So, what do you do?&quot; Since someone had mentioned a prophecy and the sunflower had obviously known I was coming, these Protectors must have had some sort of cool purpose.<br><br>&quot;The objective of the PPC is to maintain the canons of stories by eliminating things in fanfiction that would be unlikely to happen in canon. Like Mary Sues, bad pairings, characters not acting like themselves, that stuff.&quot;<br><br>&quot;That&#39;s awesome! So what&#39;s this prophecy about?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Duh,&quot; said a grumpy agent with shoulder-length brown hair, &quot;it&#39;s about you.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yeah it is,&quot; I replied, &quot;but what do I do in the prophecy?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Let me give you the prophecy,&quot; said another flower. The crowd parted to allow another agent, who had blonde hair dip dyed red in a high ponytail and intense red eyes, and was wearing a different outfit from most of the other agents, walk across the room to hand me a small tablet made of marble. &quot;Welcome,&quot; she whispered softly, then winked at me and disappeared back into the masses of people.<br><br>I wondered what that meant, but then decided not to think about it until later, and began reading the tablet. The font was an interesting sort of cursive, the cavities made in the rock by the chisel filled up with a pink and red glittery gem-substance. Nothing else was engraved into it.<br><br>Apparently, I&#39;d been lost in thought, because someone in the crowd said: &quot;Well, what are you waiting for? Read it!&quot; And so I began doing so.<br><br><i>When canon is in danger and an impure powerful love appears in the night, two fallen agents like never seen before will bring the PPC to its former might.</i><br><br>&quot;The fallen part and the like never seen before part, we know are about you and the agent who&#39;s going to be your partner,&quot; the Sunflower Official explained, &quot;since you both fell through plot holes and there aren&#39;t really any agents who are similar to either of you.&quot;<br><br>&quot;So, we&#39;re going to make the PPC great... again?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yep.&quot;<br><br>&quot;It did not say that you would <i>surpass</i> Jay and Acacia, just that you and your partner would do similarly well.&quot; This again was the grumpy agent, who upon closer inspection, seemed to be an elf of some sort.<br><br>The crowd waited for my answer to his statement. I was assuming that Jay and Acacia were really good agents from a while back in the organization&#39;s history.<br><br>So I spoke. &quot;Try me.&quot;<br><br>They burst into cheers again and streamed out of the room, leaving just me and the sunflower. I was about to leave too, until he stopped me. &quot;No partying just yet, first we must send you to your department and RC.&quot;<br><br>&quot;What would those be?&quot;<br><br>&quot;You&#39;re going to be in the Department of Mary Sues, probably the most important department in the organization. You&#39;ve already been assigned a partner, she&#39;s the other girl in the prophecy. Your response center is number 411.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Okay, I guess I&#39;ll be heading off there. Or is there anywhere else I have to go first?&quot;<br><br>&quot;No, not really. Go to your RC, meet your partner, go on your first mission. You seem good enough to not need training here.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Oh! Lovely! Thank you!&quot; I waved to the flower and left for my room.<br><br>----<br>Okay, I&#39;ve gotten a couple other comments between the time I started writing this chapter and the time I ended it, so thank you to xXth0th999Xx for the good review! Nothing much to say otherwise! Have a Foxytastic day!<br><br>-Nightmare Twistey the Demon Fox Animatronic<br><br><br>------<br><br><br>(Note from the Non-Suethor:<br><br>Why 411? Well, I really didn&#39;t feel like coming up with a Sueish number or using a letter, since it would be a little bit too over-the-top. 411 is actually the number that I hope I&#39;ll be able to use for the non-Sue &quot;Morana&quot; and her partner once I have Permission to make them actual agents. <br><br>I chose 411 because it&#39;s an important number in the game <i>Spooky&#39;s House of Jumpscares</i>, being the room in which a certain Specimen 7 appears. I have a feeling that I&#39;m going to be using &quot;Specimen ____ appears in the room with this number&quot; numbers a lot for my agents&#39; RC numbers, since they all have kind of an arbitrary feel and I&#39;m pretty sure none of them are taken, at least, 411 isn&#39;t. <br><br>Why did I choose the room number for Specimen 7, then, instead of Spec 8 (my favorite) or Spec 9 (by far the most powerful and the final boss)? Well, for starters, Specimen 9 doesn&#39;t have a specific &quot;room&quot;, but back on topic, Specimen 7 and what I&#39;ve planned so far about non-Sue &quot;Morana&quot; have something in common. I&#39;ll leave you to speculate.<br><br>-Twistey)</p>

            <p>Author&#39;s Note:<br><br>*exhales*. Okay, there are two ways I could write this note. I could rant at the people who flamed me and twisted my self-defense into supposedly me &quot;flaming&quot; them, and I could bring myself down to their level by doing so. Or I could thank the person who used genuinely logical arguments to help keep them at bay and reduce their horrible attempts at making sense into pure knee-jerk responses as are often seen on the Internet.<br><br>Who this person is may surprise you. Did I not just denounce the &quot;stupid fanfic written in a German accent&quot; in my last chapter&#39;s author&#39;s note? Well, it turns out that the person was none other than Ronion, who wrote that... interesting fic. Thanks, Ronion, for all that you did.<br><br>And JayBird and brandywine_baby09 can go to hell.<br><br>----<br><br>(That&#39;s hS and Nesh, by the way. Silly oldbies being silly.<br><br>-Twistey)<br><br>---Chapter 3---<br><br>It didn&#39;t take me long to get to my RC. Despite what I&#39;d heard about HQ, navigation was pretty easy. I just started counting black tiles on the floors, and soon enough, I was at the door of room 411. The numbers were in pink and red glitter cursive, like the words carved into the stone. I opened the door.<br><br>Inside the room, sitting on a red bed next to a pink one, was the agent who had given me the tablet with the prophecy on it. She waved and motioned for me to come in. I sat down on the pink bed and she introduced herself.<br><br>&quot;Hi!&quot; she said, &quot;I&#39;m Calamity Megaera Skadi Roxelana Hellfire, your partner!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Sweet, I have a partner!&quot; Since she&#39;d introduced herself using her full name, I felt like I should do the same. &quot;My name is Morana Kristine Stephanie Hecate King.&quot;<br><br>&quot;You have a cool name.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Thanks, you too.&quot;<br><br>We talked for a while, about what being an agent was like and what I should generally expect, and who everyone was and what they were like, and in the process we each shared personal stories until it felt like we&#39;d known each other for years! That&#39;s when a thought came to my mind.<br><br>&quot;Hey Calamity, I&#39;d like you to promise me something.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yes?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Promise me that every time I save you on our missions, you&#39;ll let me do your makeup when we get back here.&quot;<br><br>Calamity rolled her eyes, but laughed a couple seconds later. &quot;Fine.&quot;<br><br>Then she yawned. &quot;It&#39;s getting a bit late. Why don&#39;t we settle in for the night? We need some good rest for tomorrow&#39;s mission!&quot; She handed me some standard-issue pajamas and we both changed under the covers of our beds. Then we turned out the lights and fell asleep.<br><br>----<br><br>Okay, I was too lazy to come up with a backstory for either of them, so that&#39;s why there isn&#39;t much dialogue in this chapter. Feel free to give me some suggestions! No joke suggestions or other things meant to be rude to me! Looking at you, JayBird and her right-hand goon! As for the rest of you, have a Foxytastic day!<br><br>-Nightmare Twistey the Demon Fox Animatronic<br><br>----<br><br>(I had something to say here but I forgot. Anyway... you&#39;re letting people give you suggestions for your characters&#39; backstories? Well, I guess it&#39;ll be for the better, if you&#39;re willing to actually accept something sane.<br><br>-Twistey)<br><br>What is a &quot;sane&quot; backstory, exactly? I mean, aside from Morana being a demigod or the last of a fantastical race or something like that. That&#39;d be stupid.<br><br>(You&#39;re getting there. A good backstory would happen in real life. Morana&#39;s has some potential to be good - maybe her dad was part of a gang so she got to do whatever she wants and lived in Las Vegas? That sounds interesting.)<br><br>A gang?! Morana is a good person!<br><br>(I didn&#39;t say she wasn&#39;t. She could have learned a better morality system from her mom or from other kids and thus been better than her dad. Oh I love this idea!)<br><br>You aren&#39;t making any sense. Besides, don&#39;t vampires and magical powers happen in real life too, so her backstory should involve some of those?<br><br>(... No use trying to reply to that. See ya later!)<br><br>Hmph.</p>

            <p>I AM NOT PLAGIARIZING JAYCACIA. (Good God, that&#39;s a stupid name! At least Morana is an actual name!) I didn&#39;t even know who Jaycacia was when I started writing this, and I still don&#39;t really think I&#39;m ripping off of her just because a prophecy is involved. <br><br>Here are a few reasons why Morana is not a ripoff of Jaycacia:<br>   1. Morana is not a ship child of two existing agents. Morana came from Sin City itself (Las Vegas), which <i>if you&#39;d read the goddang story, you would have known!</i><br><br>   2. Morana has a completely different appearance and demeanor than Jaycacia. Jaycacia&#39;s color scheme is orange and yellow. Morana&#39;s color scheme is pink and black. Jaycacia&#39;s personality is sweet and cute like a 10-year-old is cute (as it says on the Wiki.) Morana is a different kind of cute, like a boy in high school would say that there&#39;s a &quot;cute girl&quot; in his class. That kind of cute. She also actually has a butt-kicking mindset, instead of just accidentally murdering things like Jaycacia does.<br><br>   3. My inspiration for Morana was the greatest fanfiction of all time, My Immortal, and its protagonist, Ebony Dark&#39;ness Dementia Raven Way. Again, I knew nothing about Jaycacia when I wrote the first chapter. Perhaps I should take advantage of this favorite in my reply to you by saying: You&#39;re a forking prep!<br><br>  4. Prophecies are literally everywhere in stories. Anakin Skywalker was a chosen one. The three grandkits of Firestar were chosen ones and Firestar himself was a chosen one. Discovering that you are suddenly in a world with no idea what anything is is everywhere in fiction. Think about the first Portal game, think about Minecraft, think about Avatar (not ATLA, the one with the blue-skinned people.) And as such, you have ZERO EVIDENCE WHATSOEVER, aside from Avlates_usted&#39;s suggestion about changing my fic (which I won&#39;t do, NOR take it down, NOR TEN OTHER SYNONYMS FOR TAKE IT DOWN, especially now that you&#39;re up in my a** about it), which now that my argument had been explained doesn&#39;t count as evidence anymore, that I was stealing your precious, preppy, ubermensching, Enya-listening, wolf-loving Mary Sue. Now that I know things about her, I wouldn&#39;t even <i>want</i> to steal your idea, she&#39;s such a piece of poop. BIRD POOP.<br><br>Hah. You can&#39;t even make a case, little bird. Fly back to your mommy&#39;s nest before you squawk another thing you regret or splat another white splatter with a stupid name on this earth.<br><br>-Nightmare Twistey the Demon Fox Animatronic<br><br>---<br><br>(Note from the Non-Suethor:<br><br>Wait, is this actually Jay, or... Never been contacted by Jay before on the Board. Nice to &quot;meet&quot; you, haha. Did you like my Suethor&#39;s roast of your Suethor? I thought the bird jokes were a nice touch :P<br><br>-Twistey)</p>

I could get behind it, you know?<br><br>But then chapter one started. Are you a fan of one Tara Gilesbie, also known as XXXbloodyrists666XXX, by any chance? Because that&#39;s the vibe I get from the first paragraph. Way too much emphasis on clothing, a character so full of herself it borders on parody... at least your spelling is decent, that&#39;s something.<br><br>But then we get to the whole prophecy schtick, and all I can say to that is: don&#39;t. Just don&#39;t. Stop now, start over, and come up with a character that <i>isn&#39;t</i> the center of the PPC universe (the setting of which you&#39;ve got wrong, by the way; yes it&#39;s the bureaucracy from hell, no it is not located in a typical office building).<br><br>Just, ugh. Darling. Sweetie. You show promise, you really do, but please write something that isn&#39;t going to use up the English language&#39;s stock of the word &quot;pink.&quot;<br><br>--Lemony</p>

            <p>Full Title: Five Times Dawn McKenna Cut Her Hair Accidentally (And One Time She Did It On Purpose)<br><br>A/N: So this is a slightly different kind of story than the other one I started posting below. That one&#39;s a romance, but this...well, the PPC <i>really</i> lacks 5+1 fics, which I think is such a shame! So I&#39;ve decided to write one. And since Agent Dawn is one of my favorites, and she&#39;s had long hair for <i>ages</i>, I figured it&#39;d be fun to show a couple of ways she could cut it! With or without a little help...<br><br>Enjoy!! And don&#39;t forget to R&amp;R (and Read &amp; Review too! ;) )<br><br><br>I.<br><br>Dawn was running through a Narnian forest, her long brown braid flying out behind her and thumping annoyingly against her back. It had already been a long day: first of all, she was in Narnia, which hardly ever happened. That would have been nice, if it hadn’t been so long since she’d read the books that she wasn’t completely sure of half the charges, and was having to rely on her partner.<br><br>Secondly, her partner. <i>Ugh</i>.<br><br>Oh, Supernumerary was a good enough agent. That wasn’t really in question.<br><br>What <i>was</i> in question was his attitude: which was dreadful. There were no two ways about it: working with ‘Nume’, as his lovely partner Ilraen had called him, was to suffer.<br><br>‘Nume’ was rolling his eyes now: she could just <i>tell</i> from his tone of voice. “Splendid. Caspian’s just landed a killing blow on Aslan. This should be...fun to sort out.”<br><br>“What about Peter killing that wolf? Maugrim?” Dawn asked. She was panting: she hadn’t had to run so much in a while.<br><br>She could feel the look of disdain from three feet away. “<i>That</i> is canon. Do you <i>never</i> reread books?”<br><br>Before she could retort angrily that yes, actually, she <i>did</i> reread books, loved to, in fact, but just hadn’t felt like rereading Narnia recently, something stopped Dawn short. She shrieked as she was pulled backwards by her hair.<br><br>“What <i>now</i>?” Nume demanded, but even he fell silent when faced by the sight that met his eyes:<br><br>Dawn was trying not to cry from the pain of having her hair pulled with so much force--and no wonder: her braid was tangled firmly in and around the grasp of a moving tree. It was one of the Suefluenced ones, and its twigs went through the braid even as vines wove their way in and around it.<br><br>“Oh,” said Nume.<br><br>“Ow,” said Dawn, as well as a fine number of further words which aren’t fit to print. “Ow!”<br><br>“I, er.” Nume fixed the tree with a look; it froze, but didn’t release Dawn. “Er. I don’t think I can untangle this.”<br><br>Dawn said another few words which can’t be printed, and Nume winced.<br><br>“Language,” he said weakly. “Er...I think I might have to cut it off.”<br><br>“No,” Dawn groaned. “Oh, great. This <i>would</i> happen. What a <i>splendid</i> day this is.”<br><br>“Hold still,” Nume said a little more strongly. He took out a knife; Dawn closed her eyes.<br><br>“<i>Try</i> to make it even,” she said.<br><br>Nume tried.<br><br>He really did.<br><br>*<br><br>When they got back to the RC, Ilraen stared at Dawn. &lt;&gt; he asked.<br><br>Dawn groaned. “Long story short, he had to cut my braid off. One of the Sued trees had it. It’s not even remotely even, is it?”<br><br>Ilraen managed to make a clucking sound without a mouth, which was really quite impressive. &lt;&gt;<br><br>“I don’t drink the stuff,” Dawn said glumly, “but I’ll happily drink some tea. Lots of it. And then I have to somehow find a hairdresser...they exist somewhere around here, right? I haven’t had to do more than cut off split ends in <i>years</i>.”<br><br>&lt;<i>&gt; Ilraen said comfortingly. He put a hand on Dawn’s arm. &lt;&gt;<br><br><br><br>A/N: So that was the first part! What do you think? I have the whole thing planned out, so I won&#39;t be taking suggestions...except maybe for another way she could have to accidentally cut her hair. I&#39;m still deciding on one of those.<br><br>I&#39;m really excited for the next chapter!! Aren&#39;t you? :) Thanks for reading (and don&#39;t forget to leave me some tasty reviews...)</i></p>

            <p>I&#39;m glad you...liked it? I&#39;m not so sure Ilraen&#39;ll be back, but you never know...maybe I&#39;ll eventually write a side story? I&#39;ve never really considered that pairing, but Dawn *did* just break up with Agent Des in canon, so she&#39;s single and ready to mingle...we&#39;ll see!! Thanks again for reviewing!<br><br>((I&#39;m glad you liked it! It did take some thought, though perhaps not as much as all that--it was mainly a combination of not refreshing my memory by reading something you&#39;ve written and also just going &#39;so I need them to do *this* for the story&#39; at certain points. And then Ilraen managed to get himself mixed together with a bit of Aziraphale in my head, so...that was a little odd. But I&#39;m glad it worked, and I certainly hope I can keep it up with the next set of characters! Because, yes, there are more to come...quite a few more. There are five more parts to this, after all!<br><br>But yes. I&#39;m glad you&#39;re amused :) Coming from the author of the characters I, er, borrowed, that&#39;s wonderful.

            <p>A/N: So this is going to be amazing! I hope you enjoy it lots :) I&#39;m not new to this beautiful fandom, but I fancy myself a little more grown up than when I first entered, and so I&#39;ve changed my screen name. I&#39;m not going to tell you who I am (at least not right away!!) though: I want to show you all how much I&#39;ve grown as a person and a writer without being immediately associated with my previous works!<br><br>So, this is a love story in the end :) But don&#39;t worry! It&#39;ll also have some adventure! ;) But I love these characters and they deserve some happiness...so here goes!!<br><br>A Tale of Two Women<br>Chapter One!<br><br>Jacques POV<br><br>I’ve made a change in myself; hopefully for the better. You see, I’ve got really bored of all this emptiness: I need to stop flirting with everyone, stop sleeping with anyone with a post code--oh yeah, I saw that clip--and start focusing on what’s important: finding my True Love.<br><br>I mean, that’s really all anyone wants. And I’m no different. It’s even stronger for me, I thing, because I was a fictional character to start out with…<br><br>Charlotte POV:<br><br>I was sitting in my chair last night--I’m a vampire, so I don’t need to sleep--with my pet Tarantula and thinking. Ix looks so nice when she’s asleep; she always looks nice, but at night she doesn’t worry about her scars. She’s at peace--well, sometimes. Other times she tosses and turns and cries out from nightmares. It makes me want to go hunt down everyone who’s ever hurt her and become a different kind of assassin.<br><br>Tonight she looked different ,though. More at peace. She’d been to this awesome slumber party--I wish I could’ve gone with her, but I couldn’t stand to be around so many people--and she came back with a makeover. I liked the way she looked before, but this is nice too and she seems so much happier: most of her scars are gone, and her hair is long--almost as long as mine. It falls in beautiful silken waves down her back. It even has purple high lights now, which look great. But everything looks great on her.<br><br>I haven’t told her yet that we’re moving to ESAS. She deserves a good night’s sleep--for once. But in the morning I’ll have to tell her.<br><br>I wonder what she’ll think.<br><br>Jacques POV: Eventually I decided to go to bed, fending off Luxury along the way. I wonder what tomorrow will bring?<br><br><br>Preview of next chapter:<br><br>“Don’t look at me, Charlotte, I’m hideous!”<br><br>“I thought...I thought you’d love <i>me</i>, if you loved <i>anyone</i>.”<br><br>“Oh, hey. Are you guys new here? I could...show you around…”<br><br><br>A/N: So, what&#39;d you think? Tell me all about it! ALSO! What should Charlotte&#39;s tarantula be named? Vote in the comments!!</p>

            <p><br>A/n: So I did something a little different for this chapter... Don&#39;t worry! We&#39;ll get Ix POV eventually. I just want to set things up more first!<br><br>Chapter 2<br><br>Luxury’s pov<br><br>I was just back from fighting a slime monster when I next saw Jacques. He looked gorgeous as usual with his chocolate brown eyes and pale skin; and I just couldn&#39;t believe what he&#39;d told me last night, so I took the opportunity to walk over and ask him.<br><br>“Jacques, did you mean it?” I asked him. He turned those beautiful eyes on me, but a tiny frown marred his lovely face. “You&#39;ve really given up on...on everything...to find your True Love?”<br><br>“That&#39;s right, Luxury,” he replied. I shivered when he said my name, just like always. I feel so much more alive when he&#39;s around. “I&#39;m searching for True Love. If someone like me can even find it.”<br><br>I wasn&#39;t really sure what he meant--didnt he know that just seeing him made my heart beat faster? But he didn&#39;t continue, so I tried to be as courageous as he always is, and asked, “Jacques...do you have anyone in mind?”<br><br>“No,” he said bitterly. “I&#39;d know by now if my True Love was someone I&#39;d already met. I&#39;m probably destined to be alone.”<br><br><i>Oh.</i><br><br>“I,” I said. “Jacques, I...I always thought that, well, that if you loved anyone, then it&#39;d be <i>me</i>! I mean, we have so much in common—”<br><br>“Not anymore, don&#39;t you see?” he interrupted. “I&#39;ve given up sleeping with people I&#39;ve just met—”<br><br>“I could give it up too, for you!” I cried. I meant it, with every fiber of my being. “Jacques, I...I love you.”<br><br>“And I love you,” he replied, and I stopped breathing, “but only as a friend Luxury.”<br><br>“But, but, but we&#39;ve slept together…”<br><br>Jacques laughed bitterly. “So what? We&#39;ve both slept with most of HQ! And you&#39;re not in love with anyone else, are you?”<br><br>I had to admit that I wasn&#39;t, but didn&#39;t that make this so much more special?<br><br>Apparently not, because he managed to end the conversation and leave a minute later, with a kiss on the cheek for me. I lay right down to cry there in the corridor when he was out of eyesight.<br><br><br>A/n: aw, poor Lux... unfortunately, this isn&#39;t her love story. Maybe sometime I&#39;ll write a story about that, but it&#39;s not this one!!<br><br>No preview of the next chapter this time... I&#39;m still getting through what I previewed at the end of the last chapter! It should&#39;ve said &quot;preview of following *chapters*&quot;, probably... Heh :)<br><br>Don&#39;t forget to review! I love yo know what you think...and the more reviews I get, the faster I write!!!</p>

            <p>Maybe what you should do is skip backward to Kitty and Ruby introducing themselves, and have them narrate the story from the first person perspective because otherwise how are you going to get their personalities and looks into there? Then go through the mission and make them kick lots of butt! Maybe add prophecies. Prophecies are always a good plot. I love this story so far!<br><br>Also maybe, since I wrote this good review for you, could you go review my fanfic? It&#39;s called &quot;The New Recruit&quot;, and it hasn&#39;t been getting much attention. Thank you and have a Foxytastic day!<br><br>-Nightmare Twistey the Demon Fox Animatronic</p>

For starters, she vas dressed in ein skintight leatherette vun-piece lingerie set, vizz hot pants ridink high upon her delectable, golden-brown thighs und decorative lacework formink zer bulk uff zer bodypiece.

If you are not mindink, I vill do so now!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Ach, please be goink right ahead, meine kleine FlugzeugundTARDISmädchen,&quot; zer Doktor replied.<br><br>Zer Aviator vas not needink tellink tvice, und she dashed out of zer Responsezentrum doors (slightly unsteadily, it must be beink said) und out of sight. Doktor Trollenfisch, who vas beink understandably tired from his many und extremely varied exertions, sat down in his bed of now thoroughly churned orange-flavoured jelly und began to ponder zer mysteries of zer universe, like vhat he vould be likink for his tea.<br><br>He had successfully und vizzout remorse (or recourse to his usual method of meal selection, namely ein dartboard in zer corner of zer Responsezentrum) narrowed down zer choices to ein mere twelve flavours of Poffin vhen zer door hissed open again und revealed anuzzer voman. Ein extremely vomanly voman. Zis vas turnink into qwite zer veek.<br><br>She vas beauty, she vas grace, und zer only reason she vas not Miss United States ist because she vas unable to be relied upon to vear ein swimsuit in zer swimsuit round. It vas indeed Agent Luxury, ostensibly of zer Department of Bad Slash but mostly beink of zer Department of Makink People Feel Better About Zemselves Und Zeir Vider Place In Zer Multiverse Through Zer Medium Of Rumpenpumpenmachen. Unusually for her, she vas not beink half-naked; instead, she vas beink almost completely naked, wearink only ein almost excessively teensy-veensy pair of black PVC hot pants zat vere leavink almost nothink to zer imagination, except maybe how lonk it vould be beink before said shorts ended up on zer floor. In milliseconds.<br><br>&quot;Meine kleine Luxurischemädchen, how may I be helpink you on zis fine afternoon-&quot;<br><br>&quot;Oh, Doktor, it ist terrible, truly terrible!&quot; Luxury held zer back of her hand und arched her back as if about to swoon, vhich caused zer Doktor&#39;s attention to be drawn to zer infamous Slasher&#39;s brace of superlative chestborne space hoppers. &quot;I vas just valkink down zer corridor lookink for new und interesting people vizz vhich to, ahem, <i>get acqwainted</i>, und lo and behold I should run into zer Aviator! Or should zat be Aviatrix?

Oh, voe! Voe und thrice voe!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Ahhh,&quot; said zer Doktor. &quot;I vas hopink it might be somezink like zat.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Hopink, mein Doktor?&quot;<br><br>&quot;As it ist zo easy ein think to be curink, meine kleine Luxurischemädchen,&quot; zer Doktor recovered. &quot;Vhat else could I have possibly been meanink?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Oh, jawohl, Doktor! However may I be beink repayink you? Zis chesticle-envy ist not becomink in ein enlightened und independent voman who don&#39;t need no man but ist likink to jiggle at zem in a vay in vhich male feminists perceive as zer only vay to be sex-positive und empowered!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Ach, meine kleine Luxurischemädchen, zer only payment I am needink ist seeink you receive ein clean bill of psychosexual health. Fair varning, zis vill likely be zer only clean thing you are havink after zer treatment course ist complete.

Now let&#39;s get to vork!&quot;<br><br>Zis vas goink to be ein extremely in-depth experience, und zer Doktor vas greatly lookink forvard to it as he led Agent Luxury over to zer paddlink pool full of orange-flavoured jelly. Zey engaged in many sqwishy rounds of zer Jigglyjamboree, in vhich both zer Doktor und zer Slasher took part vizz relish und many uzzer condiments, includink zer Patagonian Death Vinaigrette, vhich must normally be kept in ein sealed box in case it starts tryink to transform zer croutons into somezink not entirely of zis plane of existence, but in zis context merely added to zer fun und jolly japes. After zat und ein couple of &quot;Hasn&#39;t Zer Time Just Flown, Also Vhy Am I Not Able To Be Feelink Mein Toes&quot; breaks, it vas time for zer main event: zer Biggenslickenwobblingencuddlemachen, ein extraordinarily complex und rigorous therapeutic procedure, upon vhich (to say nothink of durink vhich) zer good Doktor vent back und forth several times. Just as zer session vas drawink to vun of its many, many, <i>many</i> climaxes, zer door burst open.<br><br>&quot;Mein Doktor! Vhat are you doink vizz Agent Luxury!&quot;<br><br>Zer Doktor vent pink - alzough in his defence, zis is beink ein very hard think for zer casual observer to, er, observe. &quot;Ah, now, meine kleine FlugzeugundTARDISmädchen, vhat ve are doink is-&quot;<br><br>&quot;Savink me!&quot;<br><br>&quot;... Agent Luxury, vhy vould you be sayink zat?&quot; Zer Aviator rocked back on her heels, deep in thought; it took some time for her gorgeously wobblesome olive airbags to stop movink. &quot;Vhat could to be beink needink savink from?&quot;<br><br>Luxury sighed, vhich caused her own boobular regions to shake like ein earthquake in ein Jell-O factory. &quot;Mein self, Aviator. Mein self. Vhen ve met earlier, some...&quot; She looked at zer clock on zer vall, vhich vas next to zer dartboard und zerefore had ein couple of darts stuck in it. &quot;... Sixteen und ein half hours ago, I saw in you two reasons to be beink deeply jealous.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Two reasons?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Ja, vun on zer left und vun on er right. Such jealousy of ein beautiful und vunderfully vomanly voman vas absolute anathem to mein values und mental vellbeing! I had to seek treatment, und zer Doktor here saved me. I never vish to feel zose things again.&quot;<br><br>Slowly, the Aviator began to be smilink as vell. &quot;In vhich case, I am thinkink zat zere ist beink ein permanent solution to your voes. Zer Doktor vill take you on as ein patient on ein permanent basis... and as ein lover, so all three of us can vork on your issues togezzer.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I think zat ist beink ein vonderful idea!&quot; Luxury could not be helpink but to clap her hands, vhich caused her to fall flat on her face vizz ein damp <i>splutch</i>. Vunce she had picked herself up from zer mostly-jelly, she craned her neck to look at Doktor Trollenfisch. &quot;Vhat say you, Doktor?&quot;<br><br>Vhat else could possibly be beink said?<br><br>&quot;Echt klasse!&quot;<br><br>TO BE BEINK CONTINUDE AGAIN!</p>

A few moments later, zhey came back und called for zer Doktor, vhich caused their mountainous cleavage to jiggle und bounce around like four blancmanges on ein extremely active trampoline. For vunce, zough, zat vas not beink vhat caught zer Doktor&#39;s eye, at least not for more zan ein couple of minutes. Nein, his eyes vere drawn inescapably to zeir necks.<br><br>&quot;Are you likink zem?&quot; Zer Aviator asked. &quot;Beink ein Time Lord, I am not really sleepink all zat much-&quot;<br><br>&quot;I am not beink sure <i>anyvun</i> has been sleepink all zat much,&quot; Luxury interjected vizz ein lascivious expression.<br><br>&quot;... Vell, ja, but it means I have been havink zer time to make zese!

Lastly, zey vere beink adorned vizz ein metal tag inscribed vizz ein image of zer Doktor und ein meesage sayink &quot;if found, please return to zis Trollenfisch along vizz any uzzer small items and/or packets of orange-flavoured gelatin&quot;. Vhich vas proof of zer Aviator&#39;s skill at collar fabrication, as zer writink vas qwite small.<br><br>Zer Doktor vas beink delighted vizz zer new development! &quot;Oh, meine kleine FlugzeugundTARDISmädchen! Meine kleine Luxurischemädchen! Zis ist beink ein most frabjous day! Calloo und indeed callay! Ve must be celebratink zis turn of events, my vord yes!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Vell,&quot; began Agent Luxury, &quot;if ve vant to be celebratink in zer usual fashion, ve must first be retrievink all zer greasy frogs-&quot;<br><br>&quot;Ach, ve can celebrate like zat later vunce ve have found zer pickle jar. I am talkink about goink <i>out</i> to celebrate! Vhat are you sayink to Rudi&#39;s?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I zink ve are both sayink ein big, bouncy jawohl, mein Doktor!&quot; Zer Aviator grabbed her new partners in ein big und sqwishy hug, zer inevitable results of vhich delayed zeir departure by roughly seven hours. After zat, und vunce zer girls had found some clozink zat remained un-gooped, zey journeyed off to Rudi&#39;s to celebrate zeir newly-minted Polyculenvanteneinencrackeren!<br><br>It vas beink ein fairly crowded evenink in Rudi&#39;s bierkeller, vizz many agents, support personnel, und miscellaneous lifeforms zat vere mostly zere for people to look at and go &quot;Wow, zer Headqwarters of zer PPC ist beink ein big und diverse place vizz many interesting-but-still-humanoid-and-thus-boinkable aliens!&quot; in attendance. Most everyvun had zer remains of ein cocktail or seven on zeir tables und vere in varying states of deshabillé, vhich informed zer Doktor (whom, it must be said, had razzer lost track) zat it vas indeed beink ein Vednesday. Zer Pink Trio vere lookink around for ein spare table vhen a call came up from vun of zer booths.<br><br>&quot;Agent zer Aviator? Ist zat beink you? Come here, come here, please be comink to sit vizz us!&quot;<br><br>Zer Aviator spun around. &quot;Oh, mein Doktor, it ist beink mein friends Ix und Charlotte! I am thinkink ve should be sittink vizz zem und sharing our good news!&quot;<br><br>&quot;I am quite agreeink, meine kleine FlugzeugundTARDISmädchen! Onvard, to zer booth!&quot;<br><br>Zer three squeezed zemselves into Ix und Charlotte&#39;s booth, ein protracted progress vhich (particularly in zer case of zer Aviator&#39;s sumptuous vomanly assets) necessitated zer use of butter und also sometimes ein crowbar. At last, zo, everyvun vas seated in ein vay vhich zhey found comfortable, or at least vas not beink involvink ein elbow to zer funbags.<br><br>&quot;Oh, zat ist beink tremendous news,&quot; said Charlotte excitedly vunce zer Aviator had told zem er previous events, includink zer bits involvink zer rubber bicycle tyres und zer industrial-grade valrus costume. &quot;I am - nein, <i>ve</i> are beink zo happy for you! Isn&#39;t zat right, liebling?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Oh, ja,&quot; said Ix, zo zere vas ein quietness to vhat she said. &quot;Ve are both beink zo happy for you.&quot;<br><br>Doktor Trollenfisch picked up on zer tone immediately. &quot;Meine kleine Gelegentlichpelzigtmädchen, vhatever ist beink zer matter!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Oh, Doktor, you are seeink through mein cunning emotional disguise, und noticink zat I am not beink mein usual happy-go-lucky und bouncy self!&quot; Ix sighed und shook her head. &quot;It ist nothink you can be beink helpink vizz anyvay. It ist not beink ein think vizz vhich <i>anyvun</i> can be beink helpink.&quot;<br><br>&quot;If zere ist somezink you are needink to be gettink off your chest,&quot; zer Doktor began, but he vas beink interrupted almost immediately by ein sob from Agent Ix!<br><br>&quot;Oh, mein Doktor, it ist vhat ist beink <i>on</i> mein chest zat ist zer problem! I vas practicink mein Potterverse magics und mein vand happened to backfire vhen I vas casting ein Engorgement Charm, und zhen, vell... zis happened!&quot;<br><br>Zer ESAS Agent threw open her robes und pulled down zer front zipper of her skintight latex bodysuit (vhich zer Doktor had hitherto been unavare came in zer colours of Gryffindor House), to reveal ein huge pair of truly vomanly enormoboobs! How zer latex had been keepink zhem sqwished inside to zer point vhere nothink had been seemink amiss, zer Doktor did not know or indeed care to speculate.<br><br>&quot;... You know, meine kleine Gelegentlichpelzigmädchen, zis might just be beink mein lucky day.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Your lucky day?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Zat&#39;s right, your lucky day.&quot; Zer Doktor steeled himself for zer comink hardships, or at least for zer comink hardness. &quot;I may vell be beink in possession of ein solution to your two big, swinging, jubblytastic problems, but zer treatment ist beink extremely complex und in-depth.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Complex und in-depth! Oh, liebe Arceus!

Meine kleine Gelegentlichpelzigmädchen, meine kleine Funkelndeblutsaugermädchen, please be finishink your drinks und be accompanyink me to mein Responsezentrum post-haste! Zer sooner ve begin, zer sooner zer treatment plan vill be effective!&quot;<br><br>Doktor Trollenfisch und zer four agents bounced out of zer booth und back to Responsezentrum Drei-Vier-Sieben, und zen zer Doktor&#39;s plan to treat Agent Ix&#39;s condition began in earnest. Zer four agents vorked in harmony to salve Ix&#39;s voes und make her be feelink deeply und personally satisfied. Zey began vizz zer Flickenbeanen, und followed zat up vizz zer Stonkingbiggenrackenjigglen, und zer final course - und medically speakink, zere could be beink no alternative - vas zer Rubberupundthoroughboinken, in vhich zer superhuman speed und strength of Agent Charlotte proved to be most useful, zough she did have to be reassured zat zer treatment vas necessary und technically legal as, courtesy of ein complex netvork of international treaties, Responsezentrum Drei-Vier-Sieben operated under zer auspices of zer Burkina Faso Subdepartment of Horizontal Greased-Veasel Tangos, und zerefore anyzink zat vas goink on in zer pool of (now refreshed) orange-flavoured jelly vas beink entirely above-board.<br><br>Eventually, all five agents made zeir vay back to Rudis, vere zer Hawaiian-themed decor und signs proclaiming it to be Andalite Karaoke Night told zer Aviator zat it vas beink ein Friday, und zerefore she owed Luxury ein tventy. (Tventy vhat, alas, ist beink unknown) Zey settled down in zer same booth as before, zough now Ix und Charlotte vere beink much closer to zeir newfound playmates.<br><br>&quot;I... I vas havink not zer slightest notion zat I vas in such dire need of your help, mein Doktor,&quot; said Ix, whose speech vas beink most languid und relaxed now. &quot;I cannot be thankink you enough.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Nor can I,&quot; piped up Charlotte, &quot;zo I am thinkink Agent Luxury ist havink zer many suggestions vhich involve zer chocolate trifle und zer beanbag chairs.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Ach, meine kleine Gelegentlichpelzigmädchen, it vas beink zer very least I could be doink! Indeed, I should be beink thankful to you und to your partner for decidink to stay vizz us on ein permanent basis!&quot;<br><br>At zis, Ix just blushed ein leetle bit und ran her finger over zer spiky pink surface of her new collar. &quot;Vell, I never vant to feel zer vay I used to again. Und now I never vill.&quot;<br><br>Zer now-expanded Interlockenpolyculen chatted for ein bit, savourink zer atmosphere of closeness und zer feelink of extraordinarily tight latex in various different colours on zeir respective skins.

Don&#39;t look at it. Just turn around - SLOWLY - and walk away. Don&#39;t let it know you saw it. Don&#39;t let it know who to come for. Just walk away slowly until you can&#39;t hear the little buzzing noises, then <i>run</i>.<br><br>===<br><br>&quot;So, you are feelink zat zer Doktor ist beink &#39;echt klasse&#39;, in your own vords, ja?&quot;<br><br>Zer Trollenfischenharem vas hangink on to zer every vord of zer speaker, Nurse Jenni Robinson, as she vas interviewink Agent Ix in zeir booth at Rudi&#39;s bierkeller.

You can be tellink me, tellink <i>us</i> vhatsoever ist beink on your mind!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Oh, mein Doktor, it ist beink such ein relief to be free of zer burden of secrecy und isolation!&quot; Nurse Jenni, her severity now beink entirely forgotten, threw off her cable-knit sveater und revealed underneath it ein shining vhite latex nurse outfit, complete vizz zer kind of cleavage in vhich people could be goink for mountaineerink holidays. &quot;Mein most splendiferous hooters have been beink zo unbelievably sensitive!

            <p>AN: Thanks to every single one of my reviewers! It&#39;s always nice to see what people think, and indeed <i>that</i> they think, which (as demonstrated by JayBird, brandywine_baby, and so forth) I think we all agree is such a rare joy.

Zere had even been ein mission, vhich ve vill not be goink into today, but suffice it to be sayink zat zer upshot vas zer Suvian in qwestion had been usink sexual energies as ein power source for his attacks, und zerefore zer Doktor und his harem had spread him thinly over ein vide area.<br><br>Zey decided vun fine mornink to be goink to Rudi&#39;s bierkeller vunce again, for it vas beink zer easiest vay to seat everyvun around ein table vizzout everyvun endink up under, on top of, or wrapped around it. Also zer Doktor had been beink in contact vizz BM und ein booth capable of containing zer horde of bouncing jiggleblimps had been constructed, apparently vizz zer aid of ein chainsaw, vhich vas ein boon to all concerned. Zer group toddled amiably (und, it must be beink said, not alvays in ein straight line) until zey vere arrivink at zer bierkeller, but vere beink most shocked to find zat zeir newly-minted booth vas beink occupied!<br><br>Zer Doktor took zer lead, floppink gently over to zer seated figure, hunched over ein glass of somezink zat vas smellink like ein bucket of turpentine vhich had been beink hom to ein dead goat for several veeks. &quot;Hallo, mein freund.

Give me the notes.&quot; The boss handed him the notes, and he looked at them. &quot;This is dangerous.&quot; &quot;I know. thats why we gave it too you.&quot; &quot;okay.&quot; Captain Deadly went out into the cetral access room to access the room where the portals were kept, so he could go into the dangerous mission. He went in, and he saw a sue. He waited until the sue was married. then it was a marry sue. so he killed the marry sue, and went home.</p>

            <p>Maybe you could stretch out the fic a little to make it longer and more detailed and more exciting? Like what does Captain Deadly look like? He&#39;s probably pretty hunky, so don&#39;t let words be spared when they could be used to describe his fabulous bulging muscles. Either way, this fic&#39;s plot is nice, and it fits right in with PPC canon! (Although sometimes it&#39;s also nice not to be canonical, but your fic is one of those situations where it&#39;s better to be canonical.)<br><br>Anyway, Thoth dearie, could you leave a good review on my fanfiction? It&#39;s called &quot;The New Recruit&quot;, and I worked so hard on what there is so far - there&#39;s a lot more to come! It hasn&#39;t been getting much attention, though - the only comment I&#39;ve gotten on it so far was a troll. :( Since I left this good review, could you leave a good review?

            <p>[AN: Thanks for the reviews guys!!! Except for the trolls, the trolls can go and [REDACTED BY FFW STAFF]!]<br>Captain Deadly got back to his cubicle. on his wall was his army uniform he used when he served with the Spacwolfs. On his other wall was a picture of his daughter which he had after he entered the army. Then an alarm on his computer rang. it was from the boss. he picked up the piece of paper and went out to the portals, heading for middleeath. When he got to middlearth, he disguised himself as one of the dwarfs. He was naturally short, so this was easy for him. Deadly continued to look around until he saw the Sue. He realized she was going to join the fellowship. So he convinced legolas to let him join the fellowship too. &quot;hello legolas,&quot; he said. &quot;I&#39;m Deadly. Let me join the fellowship.&quot; &quot;Sure thing said legolas.&quot; He travelled with the fellowship for several years as they moved towards mordor. The Sue, &quot;Mary Smith,&quot; tried to kill gandalf at the Mines, so Deadly Saved Him. Finally, just after the sue almost killed Boromir inside Barred Door - requiring Deadly to save him - Deadly finally had enough charges so he stood up and said &quot;I am going to kill you because you are a marry sue and I am ppc agent.&quot; &quot;Oh no&quot; said the sue. And then Deadly killeded her with a Plasma Ruffle from Dune. Arwen wanted to marry him in thanks, but he turned her down because he wanted to get back to work. So he portalled out.</p>

            <p>You don&#39;t really seem to understand what &#39;dangerous&#39; constitutes. &#39;Dangerous&#39; implies long, complicated words being used to describe the danger and action! The emphasis, naturally, is on the long and complicated words. Those are very important to any fiction, and sorely lacking here, I would say.</p>

            <p><i>(A/N: Personally, I would say that the entire reason anyone would read stories regarding Crim&#39;ka and Cynthia was so that they might read a romance between the two, a romance which one can clearly see if they read anything in which the two are involved. Thus, I have decided to take matters into my own hands.)</i><br>Cynthia’s left, chocolate-brown orb was temporarily obscured as she winked at Crim’ka, her partner—indeed, supposing that Cynthia was successful, the practitioner of magic most dark and foul would soon enough be her partner in multiple manners.<br>“Why might you be winking at me so, my dearest friend Cynthia?” Crim’ka inquired, elevating a single brow in a manner most inquisitive.<br>“You see, Crim’ka, I was musing over something which I have been pondering for, frankly, far too long,” Cynthia responded, the manner in which she spoke seeming to be designed to lead to a question from her partner that he might understand what she meant in greater clarity.<br>“And what, Cynthia, might that be?” Crim’ka questioned inquisitively.<br>“Well,” Cynthia replied, twirling a bit of the ebony hair whose beauty was surpassed only by the assassin herself around her finger, “I was thinking of how close we are, how long we have been partnered together, how much we enjoy one another’s company, and I thought that perhaps… we could be soul mates; that is to say, that perhaps we are meant to be.” She paused to wait for a response, expression hopeful.<br>Crim’ka’s visage transformed in that moment from the color of fresh snow to the color of the roses that spring up after that snow has been melted by the sun which burns in an intensity not unlike the passion the agents felt for one another at the time of which I write. He threw his arms around Cynthia in an embrace which was, as both agents knew in their innermost hearts, long overdue.<br>“Oh, Cynthia!” the dark mage cried happily. “I was worried that you might never ask!”<br>Cynthia breathed a sigh of relief before partially separating herself from her partner that she might kiss him.<br>“I must say,” Cynthia said between kisses, “I did not expect, joining this organization, that I would find love with a character in a fanfiction of one of my favorite games.”<br>Crim’ka merely smiled and said, “Ah, Cynthia, truly, the most benevolent aspects of our reality arise in the strangest of circumstances.”<br>A bit more accurately, he started to say this; you see, dear reader, Crim’ka was interrupted partway through the last word in his sentence by his darling Cynthia kissing him once more, resulting in a muffling of his speech. Crim’ka, however, was not particularly offended regarding this particular fact. He was much too busy with the nigh-intoxicating pleasure and catharsis of finally kissing his beloved. <br><i>(A/N: Thoughts on the narrative I have authored? I was pondering if perchance the language is not sufficiently-sophisticated...)</i></p>

            <p>this is really good, I think! So Crimka and Cynthia are in love I guess? And they like kissing eachother and stuff like that? But uh, there&#39;s lots o wrds, which is good I guess, bot maybe you could punt in more ACTOON, like with stuff happening! Ooog, they could go on a mission 2gether, and it could b dangerous, and what if 1 of them got huirt and had 2 b saved by the other1! That would b kewl.<br><br>XOXOX<br><br>(( I mistyped Cynthia with a U instead of a Y [the two are adjacent!], and I would have let it stand for badficcer authenticity, but the Board flags that sort of thing. You&#39;ll have to imagine the typo yourselves. ^_^; ~Neshomeh ))</p>

            <p>&#39;too [sic] girls?&#39; Crim&#39;ka is male (how did you even mistake Crim&#39;ka for a girl? I used masculine pronouns for him exclusively throughout the fic). But, yes, I do my best to make sure the two of them are as adorable as possible, and I appreciate your recognition of this; furthermore, I do indeed plan on writing more of them. As a matter of fact, I think I shall do just that! (It does, however, take some time to find sufficiently-long words and metaphors which accurately convey that which it intended. An unfortunate reality, but reality nonetheless.)<br></p>

I was caught by the most handsome man I&#39;ve ever seen!! He had glasses and gelled black hair, and his glasses had a red rim to them (I know they&#39;re green but red is just cooler) and he was smirking crooked at me. He looked like Andrew Garfield mixed with Chris Hemsworth and he was sooo hot. Like Edward Cullen or something. Yum.<br><br>&quot;T-t-t-t-hank y-y-you f-f-or s-s-s-s-saving me&quot;, I stammered.<br><br>&quot;Hey it was no problem&quot;, He said still smirking at me. &quot;What&#39;s your name?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Jessaminthe Layla Windflower Evenstar&quot;, I said &quot;But everyone calls me Jessa Or Jess&quot;.<br><br>&quot;Jess is a beautiful name for a beautiful elf&quot;, The Man said, setting me down and kissing my hand(!)

Twins, actually. <br><br>Selene smiled when I sayed this. &quot;Elrond and I were lovers a long time ago, and then he married Arwens mother. You and she are twins on you&#39;re father&#39;s side.&quot;<br><br>I nodded. That made sense.<br><br>&quot;So what does this mean now?&quot;, I asked curious.<br><br>&quot;You need to   find you&#39;re soulmate&quot;, Selenr said &quot;before you turn 16 or else you&#39;ll die.&quot;<br><br>&quot;But mom I already found my soulmate&quot;, I said &quot;His name is Supernumery and he&#39;s the love of my depressing life!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Have you consumated consummatted comsumated had sex yet&quot; selene asked <br><br>&quot;Yes&quot;<br><br>&quot;Ok good then you won&#39;t doe&quot;, Selene said smile. &quot;So now you need to get married.

My makeup was blue and green and gold and matched my <a href="https://i.pinimg.com/736x/63/3e/af/633eaf725cd2eba8471d7dde14902c87--amber-eyes-gold-eyes.jpg">eyes</a> perfectly.<br><br>My <a href="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/d1/50/3f/d1503f5ff70217b402e180efa8470b04.jpg">hair</a> was braided in lots of fancy braids and I was wearing my <a href="https://img0.etsystatic.com/179/1/6122470/il_340x270.1105280316_387e.jpg">white diamond and white gold elvish tiara</a> that matched my gown. <br><br>It was going to be my special day~<br><br>&quot;Jess you look perfect!&quot;, Talullah said happily and hugged me.<br><br>&quot;You look good too&quot;, I said. She was wearing a pink one sleeve and rinestone <a href="http://www.shop-wedding-dress.com/mpic/WD4-304-1.jpg">gown</a> that matched my <a href="https://www.ftdimg.com/pics/products/F692_330x370.jpg">boqet</a> of pink roses.<br><br>My gown was old, it was Selenes aka moms which that I fit into perfectly. And the tiara was new my father Elrond had it made for my coronation as princess of Rivendel when I turned 16. My makeup was blue and my <a href="https://i.pinimg.com/736x/ce/ff/39/ceff390f30dd1145ffa451622a7f6f85--diamond-shoes-bridal-heels.jpg">sparkly rainbow diamond shoes</a> were borrowed from tallullah who had over 200 pairs. She was wearing <a href="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/02/02/e9/0202e951ccceea883e4b26c57c1ea718.jpg">pink strappy heels</a> with a bow on the side.<br><br>We hugged and laughed and talked about the honeymood. Numie and mewere going to go to a <a href="http://cdn.wallpapersafari.com/78/54/HaL8iz.jpg">private tropical island</a> his parents who were very rich owned.<br><br>Then I heard the music start and I almost fainted I was so nervous and excited! <br><br><b>AN: OMG Can you believe the big day is finally happening?!?!

            <p>I do find that perhaps you are lacking in complexity of your choice of words, or more accurately, in complexity of prose as a whole; for example, rather than &#39;He said,&#39; you could use &#39;He spoke, gazing sorrowfully into my eyes.&#39; That is but an example, but I think you will find that one can extrapolate from there.</p>

The only toy <i>really</i> worth having is the one shown above: the Lenovo <i>Star Wars: Jedi Challenges</i> Augmented Reality system.

Apparently it contained &#39;up to ten incomplete novels&#39;, though on the positive side, Pterry&#39;s normal work ethic was to finish one book before he started writing the next, so these were probably mostly just notes. I hope. :(<br><br><b>Serious News</b><br><br><a href="http://www.icr.ac.uk/blogs/science-talk-the-icr-blog/page-details/america-approves-revolutionary-car-t-cell-immunotherapy-what-does-it-mean-for-cancer-patients"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/06S5PLJ.png"></a><br>(<a href="http://www.icr.ac.uk/blogs/science-talk-the-icr-blog/page-details/america-approves-revolutionary-car-t-cell-immunotherapy-what-does-it-mean-for-cancer-patients">Link</a>)<br><br>In a world first, a new cancer therapy where the patient&#39;s immune cells are extracted, genetically altered, and put back in as anti-cancer agents has been approved by the USA. Reports are claiming 80+% effectiveness against a specific type of leukaemia. Sadly, it&#39;s not so good against more solid tumours (leukaemia is blood cancer), and as with all cancer drugs it can have serious side-effects... but, to my mind, this is the first step towards the disease-killing nanobots scifi has long been promising. Even if these ones are - ugh - <i>biological</i>.<br><br><b>Not News</b><br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/TeYujjt.png"><br><br>Fairly arbitrarily, I want to talk about David Eddings. I admit I love his (or their, rather - from all accounts, Leigh was co-author for every Eddings book) novels; I own the entire Belgariad+Malloreon, the Elenium+Tamuli, and the Redemption of Althalus. While his characters are mostly able to be described by a few words each, they do tend to be <i>different</i> words. Even his female characters (we all know male fantasy writers are terrible at them, pun on &#39;male fantasy&#39; probably intended) aren&#39;t all the same - Polgara and Ce&#39;Nedra are very different, and don&#39;t line up with Sephrenia, Ehlana, and Aphrael. (Sure, they&#39;re filling the same <i>roles</i>, but Sephrenia and Polgara have very different methods of playing guide, for instance.) So that&#39;s all good.<br><br>But... he really loves his &#39;lovable criminals&#39;. You&#39;ve got Platime and Stragen in the Elenium, Silk in the Belgariad, and, uh, Althalus, of course. And that&#39;s starting to feel like a problem, because what he <i>doesn&#39;t</i> love is portraying crime as bad.<br><br>That&#39;s okay (to an extent) when it&#39;s Althalus, who - possibly in response to criticisms, I don&#39;t know - goes out of his way not to kill people. Yes, he bonks them over the head and steals all their stuff, but that&#39;s less jarring (and he gets his comeuppance anyway). Silk is (spoilers, I guess?) more of a spy than a thief, so when he does crime, you know it&#39;s in pursuit of a larger goal.<br><br>But then you get the criminals of the Elenium - which I&#39;m rereading at the moment, which brought this on - and they&#39;re... disturbing. The first conversation between criminal overlord Platime and Ehlana, Queen of Elenia is typical of this: Ehlana asks him if he&#39;s ever cut anyone&#39;s throat, and he says something to the effect of &#39;Oh, yes - it&#39;s a good way to find out what&#39;s in their purse, and I&#39;ve always been very interested in that&#39;. And Ehlana laughs it off.<br><br>Haha, this sympathetic character kills innocent people for their money. What frivolity. Sort of like the frivolity when the barbarian horseman Kring laments that he won&#39;t be able to rape any women if he joins up with the army rather than just raiding with his clan. Because rape is <i>hilarious</i>, right?<br><br>I think the problem I&#39;m having is that Eddings is perfectly happy to admit that crime happens, but steadfastly refuses (especially in the Elenium) to acknowledge its consequences. I can accept a world like Middle-earth where there&#39;s no real crime to speak of (other than Bill Ferny swindling the hobbits over a horse). I can accept a world where criminals are bad people, or make bad choices, or are stuck in bad situations. But I&#39;m having increasing difficulty with this one, where being a murdering pimp is viewed as absolutely fine so long as you&#39;re charming about it.<br><br>hS, grumpy grumble I guess?</p>

            <p>My thoughts on the Bel-Mal can basically be summed up in three words:<br><br>Eddings. Loves. Archetypes.<br><br>Take a look at the geography (<a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Department_of_Geographical_Aberrations">always a special interest of mine</a>). We know Eddings started with a map, and that&#39;s fine, though his* obsession with checking off literally every country on it can be a bit jarring once you notice it**.<br><br>*I&#39;m using &#39;his&#39; for simplicity here. It has never been clear to me how much input Leigh had in either the books she was credited for or the ones she wasn&#39;t.<br><br>**This is a commonality across the Bel-Mal, the Sparhawk books, Althalus, and the Dreamers series. It&#39;s least noticable in the Elenium, for reasons I shall come to.<br><br>But how those countries are made... in the real world, most countries*** are basically the same apart from the language. The differences between, say, Napoleonic France and Washington&#39;s America are very few - the people there spent their time in pretty much the same ways. Differences only really crop up in countries in crisis - revolutions, for instance.<br><br>***&#39;Most countries at the same stage of development and under the same circumstances&#39;. You can tell the difference between a sub-Saharan African nation and modern Spain, but throw Spain a decades-long famine and take away all its money, and the differences fade away.<br><br>Fantasy worlds aren&#39;t like that. Their countries have specialties, and don&#39;t really cross-pollinate them. Rohan in Middle-earth has its Riders; Gondor has its stone cities (to the point that various other nations refer to them as Stone-Lands). If Tolkien wrote modern England, it would be divided very neatly between rural farms and villages, and cities where everyone wears bowler hats.<br><br>Eddings goes beyond this. His nations aren&#39;t just specialised - they&#39;re <i>archetypes</i>. They pick their trait, and they stick to it right down the line. This is fine when the defining trait is &#39;infrastructure&#39;, or something else vague (Tolnedra); it&#39;s much more blatant when you run into Drasnia (&#39;spies&#39;), Nyissa (&#39;snakes&#39;), or - Aldur preserve us - Mishrac ac Thull (&#39;being a slave&#39;).****<br><br>****Yes, this last is because the western Angaraks were split by their roles in Angarak society - but frankly, the other nations are just as specialised.<br><br>This is why the Grand Tour style of writing is so blatant in Eddings - every one of his series&#39; is like that. It&#39;s least obvious in the Malloreon (where all the archetype nations are masked to an extent under &#39;being evil&#39;) and the Elenium (which drifts back towards specialisation, though the sequel series, the Tamuli, embraces the archetypes in spades), but it&#39;s still there.<br><br>This isn&#39;t necessarily a bad thing! It lets both author and reader latch onto those traits, so that you can immediately go &#39;aha, florid medieval speech - this must be an Arend&#39;. But... let me put it this way: if Eddings wrote modern America, the flag would be an eagle, which would be the most common bird, and nobody would have a job because they&#39;d all be out watching the eagles. And the nation anthem would just be &#39;Freedom - eagles - freedom - eagles&#39; over and over until you pass out (from <i>freedom</i>!).<br><br>His characters have the same tendency. Silk is a sneak. Barak is a Viking. Ce&#39;Nedra is... shrill. They pick up minor character traits that purport to round them out, but they remain very, very tightly focussed on their one-word, or at least one-line, characters.<br><br>And again, this isn&#39;t necessarily <i>bad</i>. I have a post in the works about ways to design (and stick to) characters, and &#39;pick a couple of traits and stick with them&#39; is one of them. My Agent Kaitlyn is a bubbly wannabe-Hobbit; she doesn&#39;t need much more than that to stay IC. But... it&#39;s a bit much when it spans ten books.<br><br>How do I <i>feel</i> about the Bel-Mal? I adore it. I own all 13 books, and have read even the Tolnedra section of the Rivan Codex end to end (Nedra help me). I&#39;m quite sad that we don&#39;t have more from the very, very early days - before Polgara was born, when Belgarath and his brothers hung out with Aldur - but I&#39;m very pleased to have the series. Once I&#39;ve finished rereading the Tamuli, I&#39;ll be back into Bel-Mal.<br><br>Though I <i>do</i> wish the Eddingses didn&#39;t have such an obsession with marrying every single character off. Hands up who remembers the name of Beldin&#39;s wife! <br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Well. How to respond beyond &quot;Wow, this is very thorough and I appreciate every letter of it&quot;.<br><br>I will be the first to admit that I&#39;m <i>incredibly</i> biased about this series; having it read to me before I was born and being named after one of the characters has that kind of an effect.<br><br>However, the archetypes thing is interesting to have you focus on. They aren&#39;t actually based entirely on archetypes, as I recall, but instead on real-world societies in various time periods - for example, the Roman Empire and medieval France (bet you can guess which one of those goes where) to name two of them. And we do get to see a certain amount of evolution in the standalones - we generally think of Drasnians as quick-witted spies, but Dras himself was considered nothing of the sort.<br>(And florid speech can indicate more than just the Mimbrates and, as I recall, Wacites - there was that one island of people in one of the last books. Granted, they were descended from Mimbrates and had tried their hardest to keep as close to that culture as was humanly possible, but they weren&#39;t quite still Mimbrates.)<br><br>Another reason for the specializations, in most cases, is their religions. These men have modelled themselves after the gods they follow (or tried to keep themselvs from being killed by one); Arends are hotheaded warriors because Chaldan encourages it, the various Angaraks are under the rule of Torak One-Eye and would like to not be smited - and on top of that, they&#39;re not so much tribes as they are social classes, making Angarak society better fleshed-out than almost any other in that universe... am I making sense here?<br><br>(Also, her name is Vella. D&#39;you remember what she is?)</p>

            <p>But taken to the next level. Cherek definitely out-Vikings the Vikings, and insofar as Nyissa is Egyptian, it&#39;s Egypt on snake-derived steroids. In fact, it&#39;s &#39;Egypt if Egypt was reconstructed entirely from Cleopatra being bitten by an asp&#39;. I&#39;m exaggerating <i>slightly</i>, but not a whole lot.<br><br>And then there&#39;s Sendaria, which is literally Fantasy Adventure Starting Village-land. Yes, there&#39;s ostensibly more to it... but that&#39;s why it exists.<br><br>Your points are well-made and well-taken - though of course they don&#39;t apply over in the Tamuli, where the titular continent is first introduced by way of a nation that&#39;s essentially Arendia all over again. And again, I don&#39;t think this is necessarily a bad thing - I think that Eddings made a deliberate decision to stake out one end of the Fantasy Realism spectrum - the end opposite the one George R.R. Martin took his cues from.<br><br>(I remembered Vella being turned into a blue-banded hawk, which was the only reason I remembered her existence. Then I looked it up.

            <p>Sendaria also exists to have people that <i>aren&#39;t</i> as out of control as the rest of the world - their specialty is being practical, to use your formatting.

            <p>As you say, it exists to be the baseline for the rest of the world. If Garion began his journey in Vo Mandor, taking him to Val Alorn would be too big a shift - you literally couldn&#39;t fit them into the same worldview. But he doesn&#39;t - he starts among the Sendars, who have nothing interesting going for them (^_~), and so makes for a perfect baseline.<br><br>From an internal perspective, it&#39;s also the House That Pol Built. I think I&#39;m right in saying that Sendaria is literally the nation she put together to serve as the perfect place to raise Belgarion when he finally showed up. It kind of shares that with Riva, which was pretty much built out of nothing to be the home of the Orb.<br><br>One thing that bugs me about the Belgariad is the language, or rather the lack thereof. It <i>feels</i> like all these city prefixes - Vo for Arendia, Val for Cherek, Tol in Tolnedra, Mar for Maragor, Sthiss in Nyissa... we can probably ignore Rak, and definitely Thull, but Yar might count - might point back to a common proto-word, perhaps something like Yaal... but I&#39;m pretty sure they&#39;re just sounds that he pulled from the country names/out of nowhere. And don&#39;t ever make my mistake and try to figure out what &#39;Cthol&#39; means... &#39;Cthol Murgos&#39; and &#39;Cthol Mishrak&#39; might point at &#39;land, region&#39; (of the Murgos/of Eternal Night), but then what about Rak Cthol? &#39;Landcity&#39; is a stupid name, and it would make much more sense as the &#39;Darkness&#39; component of Cthol Mishrak... but then the country is called &#39;Murky Murgos&#39;, which is dumb. And so on and so on.<br><br>Similarly, names. Belgarath&#39;s name Garath suggests that naming yourself after your hometown was normal in the early days - and, incidentally, that he can&#39;t have used the name <i>in</i> Gara - but no-one else ever uses that convention, instead naming their countries after themselves. He names one daughter after himself and/or in memory of his hometown, but then the other gets a male magical prefix and a name (-daran) that doesn&#39;t connect very clearly to either -garath <i>or</i> -edra.<br><br>It&#39;s obvious that there <i>were</i> rules he followed - double-Ls in Arendia, Ses in Nyissa, voiceless consonants (rh, kh) in Drasnia - but equally obvious that they were essentially random. And that drives me batty. It&#39;s not actually a <i>problem</i> (it&#39;s not like language in our world follows particularly obvious patterns, even though they&#39;re there!) but it always bugs me.<br><br>This comes to a head over in the other series, the Elenium, where everyone has names in Fantasyspeak - except the protagonist, Sparhawk, who inexplicably has one made out of two English words...<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Your sympathetic!=moral point definitely holds for, say, Althalus (the fact that the book is entitled The Redemption of Althalus says what it thinks about his initial moral state). But in the Elenium, the protagonist and most of his chums are Church Knights - literally warrior monks. (This is also the only series I&#39;ve read where they spend half a book trying to ensure the right guy gets elected pope; it&#39;s an odd series.) I think my problem is that <i>everyone</i> is super fine with the whole rape and murder thing. The literal knight in shining armour? Fine with it. The idealistic young queen? Fine with it. The eventual fantasy Pope? Absolutely fine with it.<br><br>Literally the only people who suggest that being a criminal might be considered a bad thing are the criminals themselves.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>...Yeah, then we have a problem.<br><br>I mean, it&#39;s fantasy, so there&#39;s always the argument of moral dissonance between our world and theirs, but rape has been, even historically, considered a fairly serious crime in the vast majority of cultures from what I recall (although some allowed for mitigating circumstances of various sorts in which it would be allowed, again IIRC).

            <p>Bramadin would like to be unblocked from the Board and the rest of the PPC, since it&#39;s now September and she feels that she&#39;s ready to come back and has been for a while. She&#39;s willing to work with anyone who volunteers to be a mentor and mediate disputes or tell her to back off. She has made clear that said mentor(s) need to be willing to consider her point of view and attempt to explain how her actions differ from apparently identical actions taken by other Boarders.<br><hr>
<br>Per the terms of the block/ban/what have you, we need to vote on this. For my part, I abstain for lack of an ability to reach a decision.<br><br>On the for unblock side, discrimination because of mental illness is bad, and we might just be inching close. The proposal was for an indefiinite-but-temporaly ban, and this is the agreed-on effective minimum term. Bram has thought she&#39;s ready to participate again, which is still an important datapoint. And she does seem willing to work with people on social stuff should that come up.<br><br>On the against side, I&#39;d cite significant interpretation issues, mainly of [people in the] community&#39;s actions and norms. A lot of said extremely atypical interpretations can be found in the thread where ban #2 was formalized in the first place. They&#39;re still around, more or less, from what I&#39;ve heard. This is evidence against the idea that the whole pile of drama that led to this vote won&#39;t repeat itself in the future. (See, for example, something of an insistence that a decent amount of what happened on 2014 was somehow provoked by us because we apparently insisted she not use her preferred agent team for Permission requests.) There&#39;s also the fact that (to use RFC words) &quot;You SHOULD NOT write large amounts of missions without Permission.&quot; just hasn&#39;t gotten through.  In summary, I&#39;m not quite convinced we aren&#39;t about to put ourselves right back where we were a few months ago, although I&#39;m less certain about that than I was a while ago.<br><br>- Tomash</p>

            <p>I understand the vote has been decided.  But I have a slight problem with this overall.  This started with the question of, &quot;Has the time been served?&quot;  Which is a fair question.  My problem is that the community then decided to go further to deciding &quot;Who wants a Permanent Ban?&quot;  Which may well be a valid question.<br><br>My issue falls to the fact that this decision was made without giving Bramandin/zdimensia/Too Purple a chance to publicly defend themselves to the community.  I know you all don&#39;t much care for the term, but you effectively tried them in absentia.  This is a problem and sets a very bad precedent, in my opinion.  <br><br>For record keeping sake, my stance on the original question of continued ban, but chance to return was an Abstention.  I do want to go on record as opposing any permanent ban for anyone taken without their direct input.  The only real input we had from Bramandin/etc. was third party communications.  <br><br>I am not opposed to the permanent ban per-se, just in this instance and how it was brought about.  This feels to me too much like the Discord Doxxing Fiasco, mob mentality convicting an individual without giving them a chance to really defend themselves.  I just think its bad precedent.  I also understand the vote&#39;s been taken and will not be changed, but now that I actually had time, I felt the need to at least let my opinions known.</p>

            <p>I mean that. If people aren&#39;t willing to disagree (<b>politely</b>) then we really will run into a mob mentality.<br><br>A few responses that spring to mind, in no particular order:<br><br>-It&#39;s very unlikely that this will become a precedent. Most of the people who voted will probably have gone by the time we next have to ban someone, and this whole situation is very unusual anyway - it needed her to not only violate her temp ban, but to do so in a way that made it clear she was behaving even worse than before.<br><br>-We did hear <i>a lot</i> from zdimensia during this discussion, including relayed messages from three different people, and one post by herself (which I will repeat was the key in my vote for a permanent ban). She&#39;s hardly been tried in absentia.<br><br>-We know what she&#39;d say, because the things she&#39;s been saying are exactly the same as the things she said on previous occasions where she was up for permaban. She feels she made entirely understandable mistakes and that we&#39;re victimising her. That has been a constant theme since, what, 2014? Nothing anyone has said - and the explanations have run the gamut from Neshomesh wordiness to Scapegrace curtness - has ever shaken the idea that she is in the right and doesn&#39;t need to change anything.<br><br>-If you feel that is is necessary, and if there is no objection, I will remove the blocks to allow zdimensia to make one post, an appeal against her sentence if you will. I would honestly rather not - I&#39;m fed up with thinking about it - but I will if it&#39;s important.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>For my part, I was conveying TooPurple&#39;s words to the thread to allow her to defend herself (well, in this case, she ended up doing rather the opposite of that, but still), but then stopped when the ban evasion, and the contents of that ban evasion, made it rather clear to me (and, given the votes, to just about everyone else) that there was almost no chance at any sort of reform given what had just happened.

            <p>I understand your concern, but unless you think there&#39;s a significant difference between Bram hitting &quot;Post&quot; herself and having Tomash and others do it for her (e.g., if you find the relayers untrustworthy), I don&#39;t think it&#39;s necessary to reopen this now that it&#39;s closed.

I reckon it would have gone better for her if she hadn&#39;t said anything at all.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>(( Bramandin contacted me unsolicited with three further responses. I am passing them on because I think the last one in particular is relevant to our decision and grants an opportunity to explain banning and blocking [<i>again</i>] for posterity, but I won&#39;t be accepting any more. ~Neshomeh ))<br><br>To: O the marvelous things:<br><br>One, I don&#39;t appreciate your sarcasm, and my beard has had gray hairs in it for years.  I would have photograpic proof that it has gray hairs now, but I shaved it off.<br><br>It would all be pointless because I believe that you&#39;re just going to stick to your own opinion and ignore everything I say.  I do consider that other people are correct, and then come to the conclusion that they are wrong.  I could say you have no capacity to consider I&#39;m correct because you conclude that I&#39;m wrong.  I do compromise at lot, which I guess you can&#39;t see because I don&#39;t preface it with any sort of statement.  I thought I had already covered my mistakes and accepted them, while the community continues to deny that there were any mistakes on their end.  I am not unapologetic because I have made apologies.  There might be something I&#39;ve forgotten to apologize for, but if that&#39;s the case it&#39;s an honest oversight.<br><br>I believe that you haven&#39;t treated me fairly.  In 2014, I didn&#39;t see evidence that you had given me the benefit of doubt.  I believe you asked me to use a set of characters that I wasn&#39;t ready to use and ignored me when I said I didn&#39;t want to use them.  I believe that right now, you&#39;re deciding not to give me another chance after in May people were willing to consider it.  I don&#39;t understand where I&#39;ve been given four chances.  The reputation is mostly from me being validly angry and people deciding that they hadn&#39;t even made a mistake.<br><br>I haven&#39;t ignored you.  I&#39;ve considered what you said and decided you were wrong.<br><br>-----------------------------------------<br>------------------------------------------<br><br>Reply to Nesh Just a couple things:<br><br>I have been tested, and they decided not to diagnose me because &quot;depression can increase the aspie traits&quot;  (IIRC, my IQ tests at 137, so I guess average people like you have scores like 190.)  I&#39;ve also tried bringing it up with a doctor, but they choose to focus on the depression.  I could try again if my insurance covers it.<br><br>Most of my experience with people has been with those do who enjoy causing pain, so it&#39;s a reasonable assumption that I could be dealing with people who follow the pattern.  A principal once got me to cry and then mocked me for it.  The group&#39;s deciding to continue something that has been shown to cause me stress is not taking great pains to avoid exacerbating it.<br><br>I apologize for thinking that you were enjoying my pain.  I&#39;ll keep that in mind for next time.<br><br>-------------------------------<br>--------------------------------<br><br>Re: Ban evasion:<br><br>One, I didn&#39;t expect the message to go through.  Two, that it did go through meant that I wasn&#39;t blocked.  If you&#39;re accusing me of hacking into the Nameless Admin&#39;s account, I didn&#39;t.<br><br>The banning me for a year because you decided I didn&#39;t work on myself when I did is wrong.</p>

            <p>There are many different systems that can be used to calculate IQ, and they all use different numbers. What&#39;s always more important to remember is the percentile that you are in. Without more knowledge and context about the system Bram used to calculate their IQ we can&#39;t make any comments about it from the number alone. <br><br>For example, I&#39;ve done a couple of IQ tests in my time. One I came out with around 190 (I think) and another I came out with around 130 (I remember the number because it was more recent). What&#39;s more important is that both times I was placed somewhere around the 97th percentile (just outside of the band of IQ required to join Mensa IIRC) but that is irrespective of the numbers I got. <br><br>After all as a mathematician I know that numbers, without context, are just numbers.

            <p>I know there&#39;s been confusion about these terms in the past, so allow me to explain them again.<br><br>A ban is a community and/or moderator ruling (as applicable) that an individual is no longer welcome in our spaces. IP blocking (or just &quot;blocking&quot;) is a tool that <b>may or may not</b> be used to enforce a ban. A person may be banned with or without technical enforcement by IP blocking. The absence or presence of an IP block does not bear one way or the other on a person&#39;s banned status.<br><br>We prefer not to use IP blocks, because that may affect people other than the banned person, but we do it in cases where the banned person cannot be relied upon to stay gone of their own free will.<br><br>This appears to be the case with Bramandin. This person is banned. The fact that an IP to which Bramandin has access may not have been blocked does not change the fact that she is banned. Attempting to post from any IP while banned is a show of bad faith. Incidentally announcing your intent to continue flouting your ban is a show of even worse faith. Possibly zero faith.<br><br>I will be in favor of continuing to enforce the community&#39;s decision by whatever means necessary.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Bram, you need to understand that the community owes you nothing. You can talk about forgiving us or not, but honestly, I haven&#39;t lost any sleep over it, and I don&#39;t think others will either. You seem unwilling to accept your role in what happens, and for as long as that is the case, you definitely should remain separate from this community. </p>

            <p>I was expecting this to be an ambiguous, nuanced situation, where the question was whether what Bramandin had done/claimed to have done was sufficient. That&#39;s why I said outright that I wasn&#39;t going to be voting.<br><br>Instead, Bramandin has continued with the line of &#39;I have done nothing wrong and need to change nothing, but I will graciously consider forgiving you and gracing you with my presence.&#39; See:<br><br><i>I had forgiven you for your mistakes, but you did nothing to reinforce it, so I&#39;m retracting my forgiveness until you&#39;ve earned it.<br><br>As for functioning in an online community, I&#39;ve interacted with a couple of different ones.

<br><br>Bramandin: you don&#39;t want to be in the PPC community. You don&#39;t <i>like</i> the PPC community. You don&#39;t like the people in it, you don&#39;t like the rules it has, you don&#39;t like the way it treats you, you don&#39;t like anything about it. Stop trying to force your way back into a community that you don&#39;t like.<br><br>The only explanation I can come up with is that you desperately want to write PPC stories, and are aware that getting Permission is part of that. So look, here: on my authority as a Permission Giver, I grant you the right to write as many PPC stories as you please, so long as they are never published online. If you enjoy it so much that you&#39;ll keep trying to fling yourself at us to be allowed to do it - go wild.<br><br>And stop trying to rejoin the PPC community. There is nothing about it that you like, so just... leave.<br><br>hS</p>

She has now twice posted in breach of bans laid against her by the PPC community.

            <p>I don&#39;t like doing this, and honestly, I ultimately did not decide on this because of the disruptions that Bram has caused. I honestly think this might be the healthiest possible option for them. I feel, if any non-permanent ban was issued again, Bramandin would be waiting for that ban to be over, and would not stop thinking about the point at which they would be allowed back in. This would not be good for them, and I feel like the only way to prevent them from waiting outside of the metaphorical door is to slam it shut and lock it permanently behind them. So, I am sorry, but I am voting for a permanent ban.</p>

            <p>I was wondering how soon it would be before a ban of any kind would happen ever since her disastrous initial Permission request (granted, I did get in trouble for being uncivil as well, but still). I had hoped that she would learn from the trainwreck that transpired and is apparently still ongoing since then, but no. So a permaban vote it is.<br><br>I also wonder, since the permaban is more than likely going to be enacted, if any writing or articles pertaining to the IP of this individual will be removed from the PPC Wiki once it does. I&#39;m debating about that a little internally since on the one hand I feel it&#39;d be unbecoming to remove any PPC records no matter how small or insignificant, but on the other, this person&#39;s proven far more trouble than she&#39;s worth around these parts. Then again, of course, that isn&#39;t exactly my decision...</p>

            <p>I haven&#39;t said much on this subject, due to a combination of real life and not wanting to rehash things that have already been covered, but I&#39;ve been quiet long enough. Zdimensia/Bram/TooPurple has repeatedly demonstrated—through Board posts, instant messaging, and emails—that they are unwilling to act as a member of this community. We have been lenient before, and our leniency was rewarded with harassment and disrespect. There has to be a point where we draw the line, and I would argue that this is it.<br><br>PC</p>

            <p>From what I can tell, TooPurple/Bramadin/zdimensia (let&#39;s go with Bram for simplicity) is about as likely to not be a disruptive influence if readmitted as Agent Ix is to send an HQ-wide email coming out as a werewolf (for the reasons set forth by hS and others).<br><br>So, if we consider my proposal for the requirements for opening revote (&quot;[Some Boarder has] a good reason to believe [we&#39;ll let her back in]&quot;), I believe that almost surely won&#39;t happen in the future, at least for me. Therefore, I might as well simply my position on the issue to &quot;permaban&quot;, which also takes care of a bunch of potentially confusing clerical issues about what, exactly, the community has decided to do about Bram.<br><br>- Tomash</p>

            <p>I would have suggested it earlier, given that this is either the third or fourth time this has been brought up, but I wanted to see the consensus first. Now that Bram has decided to throw this into the mix, I feel that a permaban is the only option. <br><br>And Bram? You earning permission again required you following your ban and earning a place in the community again. Just demanding a place is not good enough.

            <p>All the marvellous things I wish I could say, right now! <br>O&#39; how this thread could travel off into the night; <br>O&#39; how I could discuss and argue for hours and hours and only stop in order to trim my new, greying beard! <br><br>But it would <i>all</i> be pointless because, Bram, you have no capacity to consider that somebody else is correct! Why, <i>that</i> is why nobody thinks you&#39;re ready to rejoin the community! Notice the phrasing I used? &#39;Community.&#39; Because the PPC is not a dumping ground in which to toss your written stories and leave them there in the dust, but a <i>writing community</i>, in which you must interact with, respect, and have compromise with! You seem to think you can compromise, boldly claiming &#39;The entire blame is not on the community,&#39; but you then criticise it for not acknowledging its mistakes and for requiring amends and forgiveness! <br>Amends for what, Bramandin? Forgiveness for what? Bram, as long as we expect basic decency out of you, you will <i>forever</i> need our amends and forgiveness!<br>And, why, as you read this you will undoubtedly completely ignore the possibility that perhaps I may have a point, and instead blame it on the community (hey, &#39;community&#39; again!) and explain that you vaguely improved somehow in some way or another! <br><br>In fact, it seems that, where I <i>thought</i> my basis for voting against your return was because I think you have absolutely no respect for anyone here, and because there are friends of mine who have been hurt by you while you remain unapologetic, and because your reputation has become as such that a simple relaying accident led to me reasonably concluding that you were passive aggressively insulting me, and because you have been given <i>four</i> separate chances to improve without changing a single thing beyond your name (in spite of your constant arguments against this), I was <i>actually</i> bigoted! <br>Why, you had been given <i>another</i> undeserved chance to show that you had improved, and you instead ignored every single thing I said and concluded that my reasoning was worthless because you decided I was being <i>discriminatory</i>! <br>Who would have guessed that Larfen J. Stocke, esq. was a bigot?<br>You think you <i>know</i> a guy! <br><br>But that&#39;s the end of that. This discussion is pointless and over and I regret even starting it, and I am more than happy for this entire situation to end with me a &#39;bigot&#39; and Bramandin banned. </p>

            <p>If the vote results in a continued ban, I don&#39;t plan to ask for another vote unless I have a good reason to believe that the result is likely to be different, and, in any case, don&#39;t plan to raise the issue for a long time (that is, at least a year from now in the best case).<br><br>My reason for this is that I don&#39;t want to put the community through a bunch of ultimately pointless re-votes about Bram, since that&#39;s counterproductive and at least a bit harmful for everyone involved in this issue.<br><br>I&#39;m going to suggest that other people follow these guidelines about re-votes (or at least the first bit about a likely change in result), but, obviously, I&#39;m not the PPC dictator and people should use their own judgment about if (or when) to bring up this stuff again if we continue the block.<br><br>- Tomash</p>

            <p>It&#39;s a rather basic social rule that demanding positive attention from people who don&#39;t want to interact with you is not at all OK. I would&#39;ve hoped that, after all the explanations last May and the <i>conditional ban</i>, TooPurple would have at least understood this. This post, however, makes it clear to me that she either cannot or will not abide by this rule at this time. <br><br>This means, as far as I&#39;m concerned, that if we let TooPurple back in now, it will only be a matter of time before she causes another harassment issue. Whether or not such behavior would be malicious or even intentional, I do not want this community or anyone in it to be subject to such harassment or the harm TooPurple would cause by engaging in it.<br><br>And so therefore I vote to continue TooPurple&#39;s ban until such time as we are satisfied that she can abide by the norms of interaction in this community.<br><br>Furthernore, it has become increasingly obvious to me that there is nothing to be gained, other than increasing frustration on all sides, from more responses by TooPurple being posted in this thread. Therefore, I will not be posting any more of them.<br><br>If anyone else wishes to begin posting additional responses from her, but doesn&#39;t have TooPurple&#39;s contact information, I can get you in contact with her.

            <p>I feel like this isn&#39;t a matter of mental health. For me, at least, that hasn&#39;t ever been part of the equation. The problem is... Honestly? I&#39;m not going to claim to be in any way some kind of authority on the matter, but if I had to say what I think in one sentence, it&#39;s that I don&#39;t think that Bramandin has a history of improving. It seems that at any point, from writing to working with the community, Bramandin has a history of either not responding to criticism, saying they will work to improve themself but not providing evidence of it, or even spending the time dedicated to that on other things instead, as might be seen in Phobos&#39; post, or stating that the issue is not with them, but with us, and I would point to their first response to Neshomeh for this. None of this is would seem, and I place emphasis upon the word seem, to point to a devoted effort to come to a better place that would lead to a better community experience for all sides. Because of that, I am voting that Bramandin&#39;s block be continued.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m sorry Bram, but I just don&#39;t think you are compatable with this community. I know that you have mental health issues, and I fully respect that fact. You need to find a group of people who you can connect with and share passions with. But it has been proven time and again that we are not equipped to help you. When you are confused, we have problems clarifying to where you can understand. This causes conflict and hurt, for you, and for us. Hurt that I just don&#39;t feel is worth it. I truly hope you find a community better at working with you, and can make you happy. But I&#39;m afraid that&#39;s not here.</p>

            <p>I don&#39;t know how to phrase this terribly well - thinking is confusing - but I definitely know that I do not want Bram back in here yet.<br><br>Last time this came up, I was the one to start the thread, because Bram contacted me and - after a few conversations - asked me to. And I was absolutely, positively terrified the entire time. A big part of it was that I love it here and would have been positively crushed if I had been asked to leave or unofficially shunned for that, but that was most certainly not all of it.<br><br>I will <i>not</i> say that Bram was taking advantage of how nice I can be, or how strongly I feel about helping people. I will freely admit to being something of a people-pleaser, but I very highly doubt that that was Bram&#39;s intention, and how would e know that it actually physically pains me, to one degree or another, to say the words &quot;I can&#39;t help you&quot;?<br><br>I gave Bram a chance to reasonably explain eimself to me without having to wade through everything everyone else had to say about eim, and then proceeded to ask other people for their versions of the story, because I believe in getting all sides of a story before passing any kind of judgement. (That belief goes a little ways out the window when I am contacted very late at night by a drunk person, though.)<br><br>What&#39;s really bothering me, I suppose, is exactly what Scape said: Bram has openly admitted to being manipulative. Now, I will be the first to admit that this is a touch hypocritical coming from me, because I am also a manipulative person-whose-parents-were-never-married. However, the distinction I&#39;m making (and please do correct me if I&#39;m wrong here) is that I know very, very well when to stop messing with people and get serious. I know when it&#39;s not okay to be the Chessmistress. And never, <i>never,</i> do I attempt to be manipulative when it&#39;s not a game. And I&#39;m not entirely sure the same can be said about Bram - I&#39;m actually fairly certain it can&#39;t be, or at least not without a modifier or two.<br><br>For the time being, I rest my case.<br><br>--Calliope</p>

Any other result will lead to a request for more opinions. Explicit abstensions (eg, Tomash&#39;s post) will be counted as a &#39;third party vote&#39;, ie, they count as part of the 100%, but not as either 60%. Simply not giving an opinion (eg, my post here) does not count as a vote.<br><br>The three requirements will be ignored if at least 15 people post in the first 48 hours, with a 60% majority voting for unblock and no votes for a continued block. This will be subject to identity verification by IP, and confirmation that no off-Board collusion was involved.<br><br>Any of these rules may be changed by request of at least 6 non-banned Boarders unanimously, or by a 50% majority of Boarders voting on the issue.<br><br>I&#39;m sorry to come over all legalistic, but I flat-out refuse to allow any uncertainty in what the Nameless Admin will and won&#39;t do here.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>What Bram&#39;s been doing to improve her ability to function in an online community. Has she sought therapy, for instance? Found a support group of some sort? Gotten on the same page with her husband, at least, who she was apparently falling out with some time back? She says she feels she&#39;s ready. Okay. I wanna know what work she&#39;s done to arrive at this conclusion, and what she thinks she can do better now than she had done before.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>And honestly, I see nothing in this that makes sense of why you (Bramandin) would even *want* to come back, except perhaps for closure (at most). Almost every paragraph of this, including the posted corrections, shows a very low opinion of this community; I accept that perhaps the description of the other online communities might not have been intended to sound so passive-aggressively negative, but it does. I have no understanding of why you&#39;d want to interact with us again--the only reasons I can guess at are closure and liking the concept of PPC HQ--and what&#39;s more, as far as I remember those are the only two reasons I can pick out from the thread in May, too (which I&#39;ve glanced at recently, but have no wish to reread thoroughly).<br><br>I&#39;m not here to give you apologies on behalf of the community. If you want your accusation-turned-feeling that PPCers found (find?) joy in adding to your and your husband&#39;s stress addressed, then here: to my knowledge, no one here has felt that way, and if they have, then that&#39;s on them.<br><br>What&#39;s more, there have been a lot of stressful events this year. A number of people (a minimum of four, I believe) left; several more went on hiatus. I very nearly did the same myself; the *only* reason I didn&#39;t go on hiatus was that I took so long trying to put the post together that I moved in the middle. By now I no longer feel the same need for a hiatus, so I&#39;ve elected (up until now, I suppose) to leave the dust more or less settled, despite having felt strongly that it ought to be noted that one reason I wasn&#39;t as active was because of what happened.<br><br>My point, however, is this: pretty much everyone who joined the Board before June of this year and was around in the March through May period was exposed to stress. Even the people who tried to stay on the sidelines. I sincerely hope that nowhere in all of that was someone grinning about adding to others&#39; stress levels; and if there somehow was, then I certainly hope they&#39;ve had a good long think since and will never do it again. And, to return to Bramandin, *if* anyone was doing that in your case, well, same note. But if anyone was, it&#39;s *definitely* not widely known. We are not and have not been sitting around giggling about stressing people out.<br><br>I did say I&#39;m not here to apologize. What I will say is that it&#39;s regrettable you feel that way, and that you have so low an opinion of us.<br><br>I also agree with the other people who have said that the PPC and you do not seem to be a good match--not for you and not for us. And for that reason especially, I am voting to uphold the ban.<br><br>I&#39;m glad you&#39;ve found other online communities that are a better fit. I hope that goes better for you and for them.<br><br>~Z</p>

            <p>It probably won&#39;t do any good, but I feel a couple points need to be made for posterity.<br><br>First, in response to &quot;The therapy part is impossible because I don&#39;t have a diagnosis&quot;:<br><br>That is pure nonsense. Part of getting therapy would involve the doctor seeking for and arriving at a diagnosis, then proceeding from it. You don&#39;t go to your GP, tell them you have strep throat, and expect them to treat based on <i>your</i> conclusion; no, you go in, tell them your symptoms, and let them perform tests as needed so <i>they</i> can determine the correct diagnosis and treatment. It&#39;s the same with a mental health practitioner.<br><br>The lack of insurance is a serious problem, and that sucks, but it doesn&#39;t change the process of how diagnosis and treatment works. If you&#39;re persistent, you may even find a good, affordable doc that works with the uninsured until you get a new plan.<br><br>Second, in response to no one (except Zing) denying that we find joy in adding to Bram&#39;s stress:<br><br>There&#39;s a perfectly good explanation for this. Most of us, through past experience interacting with people in general and the people of this community in specific, know that most people do not find joy in causing others pain. If we notice that anyone around us actually does, we don&#39;t keep them around. Nobody in this thread, or past discussions with Bram, has shown even the slightest hint of enjoying Bram&#39;s confusion or stress or mental health difficulties. I believe that any reasonable observer from the outside would find it abundantly clear that the truth is quite the opposite: we&#39;re all stressed out and confused and really taking great pains not to exacerbate anyone&#39;s mental health situation. It really does go without saying.<br><br>Bram has previously <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=308638;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">expressed</a> a need for us to say that &quot;things&quot; aren&#39;t true. Well, Zing did, and now I am. However, saying demonstrably outrageous things just to see if we&#39;ll deny them comes across as extremely manipulative, and I find it not at all remarkable that hardly anyone has taken the bait. This community does not need anyone to apologize for its behavior, because its behavior in this has been exemplary.<br><br>That&#39;s my bit; I&#39;m done. Just needed to get that off my chest.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I think that abstentions shouldn&#39;t be added to denominator when computing the percentage of voters for or against something, but that should count towards quorum totals (&quot;at least X people post&quot;). From a quick check of Google and Wikipedia, it appears to be how a lot of places that vote on stuff do it.<br><br>The reason for this is that, if we count explicit &quot;meh&quot; votes as their category, we can create some really silly situations. For example, suppose that, on some question that isn&#39;t about cats (with the 60% vote threshold to change anything), one person votes &quot;Yes&quot; and everyone else posts &quot;I like kittens (nm)&quot;. This makes the vote pass, under the current rules. However, if everyone else instead posted &quot;I abstain (nm)&quot;, the vote fails. This feels really weird. <br><br>In practice, this means that X unanimous people can be X people who either vote for/against something or explicitly abstain, as long as there&#39;s someone in there who actually had an opinion.<br><br>- Tomash</p>

            <p>In my capacity as someone who probably got (and continues to get) more lifelines than they probably should have, I understand how important a second, third, fourth, fifth, and eleventy-squillion-and-sixth chance can be. I also understand how they can feel to the person who gets them; to me, they always felt like a way out of a stupid situation that I&#39;d gotten into because of my comprehensive inability to control either my depression, my anxiety, or my anger. Believe me when I tell you how much I understand the importance of having a community to support you, not as therapists but as friends with a shared interest.<br><br>So why on God&#39;s green Earth am I still voting for this block?<br><br>I don&#39;t know Bram all that well, but I remember the fallout from their being here before - both as Bram and as zdimensia (hey, remember that?). I remember Bram saying outright that they manipulate people as a matter of course, and that they did so to Neshomeh in order to be allowed back into the PPC in the first place. That&#39;s what rubs me up the wrong way about all this - the history of known manipulation and deceit on Bramandin&#39;s part. That&#39;s also what gives me pause about Bram&#39;s request for a mediator/mentor/parole officer/whathaveyou - it&#39;s a good idea in theory, but in practice I doubt its efficacy given Bram&#39;s history of self-admitted manipulation.<br><br>I&#39;m also not a fan of some of the phrasing in the request. Bram states explicitly that any potential mentors must &quot;attempt to explain how her actions differ from apparently identical actions taken by other Boarders&quot; should the need arise. Frankly? That sounds like sour grapes. It sounds like someone who still thinks &quot;But Thorin Oakenshield did it&quot; is actually an argument. It sounds like someone who, instead of admitting when they&#39;re wrong and apologising, <i>even if they don&#39;t necessarily mean it</i>, will dig in their heels and cause yet more enormously derailed threads full of squabbling and discontent.<br><br>I don&#39;t think we need that any more.</p>

            <p>Just because <i>you</i> don&#39;t see it (or choose not to; I was in that position with my anger and GID for <i>years</i>) doesn&#39;t mean it isn&#39;t there. You admitted bluntly that you manipulated Nesh into letting you back into the community as Bramandin, and after your subsequent block, you were trying to bend the rules after <i>one poxy week</i> to get back into writing PPC stuff.<br><br>To be completely honest with you, I&#39;m surprised that Nesh and Tomash and everyone else haven&#39;t blocked your email address out of respect for their own mental health; you demonstrably don&#39;t believe that you need to put in any kind of effort to improve, or at the very least moderate your behaviour. Through your continued actions - the passive-aggression, the disregard for community standards of behaviour, the insults - you show that you think it&#39;s all on us to walk on eggshells around you, and that because we don&#39;t, the rules do not apply to you. It&#39;s like Larf said further up the thread; we&#39;re going to have to keep doing this ridiculous song and dance until either we&#39;re forced to ban you outright or you get what you want, which seems to be carte blanche to do and say and write and make others feel however you choose without any kind of criticism of or consequence to your actions.<br><br>I realise I&#39;m ranting. If other members of the community judge that I&#39;m going too far, other members of the PPC will pull me up on it. I will then back down and issue an apology. This is how the community is supposed to work, and how it does work, and how you want it <i>not</i> to work purely and solely in regards to you. You don&#39;t want to be a part of the PPC. You want to <b>run</b> the PPC, and run it like an autocrat swaddled in cotton wool by yes-men.

            <p>A one-time prank does not make a pattern of behavior.  I wanted to come out a lot sooner, but July told me not to.  I didn&#39;t like continuing the prank, but I did what I was told.<br><br>As for bending the rules, I was told that writing for the drawer is fine, and writing permission prompts has always been in the rules.

I&#39;m actually able to put up with a lot.  What I do expect is that when I say there is a problem, I am not ignored.  In turn, I will do my best to treat you with the same regard.  A lot of the not-listening from before was because I felt not-listened-to.  I may slip a little, and need leeway for that, but criticism is fine.  I&#39;ve been doing everything I can.<br><br>As far as the insults, some things can be worded better, but I feel like you can&#39;t take anything that&#39;s slightly critical.  I did amend my one opinion to include &quot;I feel like you&quot; and I can&#39;t tell if anyone has said that isn&#39;t the case.  It was something that needed to be addressed or else it would have bred resentment.  This is one point for a mediator, which is a reasonable accomodation.  (Tomash is mainly relaying, not acting as a mediator.  We had slightly different expectations here that weren&#39;t worked out in the beginning.)  Heck, just asking me if I meant it as an insult is already in the constitution.  You&#39;re the only people who&#39;ve seen things as passive aggressive, and I believe I&#39;ve asked for what to do differently.  I&#39;ve read an article, and it says that it&#39;s an avoidance of conflict technique, but I feel that if I&#39;m blunt you&#39;d just complain about that.  Tell me directly what you expect.<br><br>I also feel that you insult me all you want and expect not to be called out for it.  You&#39;re making statements that are really biased and not at all representative of me.  I&#39;ve been called an asshole, delusional, and then there&#39;s your thread which is vitriolic and untrue.  I particularly don&#39;t want to run the PPC.  Suggest improvements, maybe.<br><br>The disregard is in the past, and a simple reaction to what was perceived as being dismissive to me.  I have worked on that.  Anything from 2016 on is a simple communication error.  Since I can&#39;t remember if I actually apologized for the prank, I will do so in another thread, but I&#39;m going to need some help because I can&#39;t remember the formula that makes it a valid apology.<br><br>(( For my part, even though I&#39;ve been staying out of this, I disapprove of the eye-for-an-eye approach alluded to above as far as listening to us, and am not convinced it won&#39;t continue if Bram were somehow readmitted at this time<br><br>- Tomash ))</p>

I&#39;m not even sure what to say. Odd, at the very least. I do *kind* of see why you&#39;re using the word, but it still feels very mismatched considering that you&#39;re talking about deliberately getting around a ban by posting under a new identity with, as far as I remember from the email logs Neshomeh posted, adopting a persona designed to while certain treatment involved. Pranks--at least, the fun, lighthearted kind--don&#39;t generally include bans. If anything, this was you trying to prove a point--something which I remember featuring quite heavily in the discussions in May. &quot;Prank&quot;...*really* doesn&#39;t fit, or not without diminishing the actual action into something less serious in nature, which... euphemism. That&#39;s the word I&#39;m looking for. &quot;Prank&quot; here seems like a euphemism for what actually happened, and that&#39;s... the euphemism is very different from the reality, which isn&#39;t good in a thread that&#39;s trying to look at what was and if something&#39;s changed.<br><br>And one more thing: in the last few relayed posts, you&#39;ve been saying that &quot;[you] could do all of the work [you] could outside of the community.&quot; (That quote taken from the reply to Larfen&#39;s post titled &quot;Irrelevant&quot;).

I&#39;ve done all that I can outside of the community.&quot;<br><br>What I got from that was that you&#39;d done everything you felt you could do outside the PPC community, and what you&#39;re telling and showing us now is the result. That nothing else will change beyond whatever we could somehow hypothetically do (and seeing as we&#39;re not, say, therapists, I&#39;d expect that to be *very* limited). And that&#39;s not what you&#39;ve been saying in later posts while presumably referencing that one--you&#39;ve been, as far as I can tell, implying that you could do even more, or else that you could continue doing what you&#39;ve been doing outside the community...? Honestly, I&#39;m not completely sure what you&#39;re​ saying, but it doesn&#39;t immediately seem to match up.<br><br>That&#39;s all I&#39;ve got. I&#39;m curious what you meant in that first post and with your more recent wording, but other than that, I&#39;m out again until something really catches my eye to comment on in this thread. If something I&#39;ve written here is unclear, I apologise for that; it&#39;s been a long day and I didn&#39;t spend most of it in English.<br><br>My vote stands<br><br>~Z</p>

            <p>Nice, standard mission.  Nothing complex happened, but you used the weather and Sue song as good sources of frustration for the agents, which makes it even funnier when they get the unexpected boon of the Sue tying herself up.  Lainduilien is cute at the end, too.

<li>Ave and Dee are doing a wonderful job of the &quot;friendly bickering&quot; component of a relationship<br>- Oh, Zeb. Are you going to be poking fun at those two for the whole mission?<br>- Elanor is cute<br>- ... I had to look up who Lainduilien was - that was a good meta joke<br>- Heh. The Aviator&#39;s flying.<br>- Yes, Zeb, please do play Bingo<br>- Trying to clear water out of your head seems like a reasonable response to being italicized<br>- Of course DoSAT has a betting pool on how many C-CADS Ave and Zeb will blow up<br>- Ok, so this entire fic is basically going to rip off Disnay movies in an Avatar setting with some stupid extra sort of bender tossed in?<br>- Good point about two-story houses<br>- re: jungle &quot;On second thought, Generic isn&#39;t so bad&quot;. snrk<br>- That&#39;s a good description of picking food<br>- Ave and Zeb drying off in the TARDIS (with the clothes and the butt-licking) is a cute scene. Also, where did the Aviator get that burn scar?<br>- Zeb has a point about the hot guys<br>- &quot;thicker than Goyle&quot;<br>- I&#39;ve learned something about wave heights today<br>- The scene in which Zeb asks Ave if she&#39;ll be OK is touching<br>- Nice of the Sue to make the assassination easier<br>- Zeb putting on the earmuffs for Elanor. Heh.<br><br>So, overall, this was short and had a lot of neat moments between the agents, and took decent advantage of the silliness of the fic to create some funny situations and lines.</li>

            <p>So, uh, this is the first serious fanfic I&#39;ve written in a long time. I worked hard on researching the lore, since I&#39;m kind of a newbie to TES. I&#39;ve been sitting on it for months due to real life stuff, both for me and my betas, but now everyone has signed off on it, so here it is:<br><br><a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12638704/1/Eyes-on-the-Horizon">&quot;Eyes on the Horizon&quot;</a> - rated T<br>Before Ethne and Farkas can leave Solstheim, Wulf Wild-Blood sends them on a mission close to the Companions&#39; hearts. Spoilers: <i>Dragonborn</i>&#39;s main quest, &quot;Filial Bonds,&quot; and &quot;Retaking Thirsk&quot;; also the Companions&#39; questline and the conclusion of <i>Skyrim</i>&#39;s main quest.<br><br>I would greatly appreciate feedback, on ff.net if possible, but here is good, too. I am very anxious, but concrit is always welcome.<br><br>Thanks to all my betas for doing what they could, and props especially to Maxewell. He was both timely and thoughtful, and even though I didn&#39;t agree with all of his suggestions, I appreciated them. 10/10, would work with again.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Muchas gracias for the review. I&#39;m glad you liked it! Especially the sweet bits.

            <p>(No news this week; Mandos take the news, it&#39;s all miserable.)<br><br>Essentially what it says on the tin: songs which weren&#39;t written with a scifi story in mind, but are clearly perfect fits. Here are the ones that spring to my mind:<br><br><b><a href="http://songmeanings.com/songs/view/12881/">To The Moon and Back</a>, by Savage Garden</b><br><br>Sample lyrics:<br><br><i>Mama never loved her much and<br>Daddy never keeps in touch<br>That&#39;s why she shies away from human affection, but<br>Somewhere in a private place<br>She packs her bags for outer space<br>And now she&#39;s waiting for the right kind of pilot to come<br><br>And she&#39;ll say to him...<br><br>I would fly you to the moon and back<br>If you&#39;ll be, if you&#39;ll be my baby<br>I&#39;ve got a ticket for a world where we belong<br>So would you be my baby?</i><br><br>I heard this on the radio yesterday morning and immediately had the idea for this thread. It connected itself instantly to Anne McCaffrey&#39;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ship_Who_Sang">Ship Who Sang/Brain &amp; Brawn</a> series (which are about spaceships with two &#39;crew&#39; - a human captain, and a severely physically disabled &#39;shell person&#39; acting as the ship&#39;s computer). In particular, my mind got hung up on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ship_Who_Searched">The Ship Who Searched</a>, and Tia/AH-1033, who very much fits the &#39;abandoned child&#39; motif of the song, as well as literally hunting for the right human partner to fly to the stars with.<br><br><b><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MPkX9GBTEs">Carried by Honor</a>, by Heather Dale</b><br><br>Sample lyrics:<br><br><i>When I was a child I thought about nothing<br>But valour and glory and victory&#39;s might<br>I started with little and built from it something<br>I thought I would need when the time came to fight<br><br>I forged my sword from the steel of my kingdom<br>I crafted my shield from the love of my kin<br>I&#39;m carried by honour and dreams of a future<br>Made real with each battle I win.</i><br><br>Okay, it was sort of inevitable that this would jump straight to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honorverse">Honor Harrington books</a>, given the title... but it fits alarmingly well with the theme of the books - family, friendship, fighting to secure the future. The connection really clicked for me when I remembered that <s>Queen</s> Empress Elizabeth of the Star Empire of Manticore was given the name &#39;Soul of Steel&#39; by the treecats... &#39;from the steel of my kingdom&#39;, indeed.<br><br>(This song was an exclusive reward for backers of the Queens of Avalon musical; it&#39;s mighty hard to find anything about it online.)<br><br><b><a href="https://genius.com/A-great-big-world-say-something-lyrics">Say Something</a>, by A Great Big World/Christina Aguilera</b><br><br>Sample lyrics:<br><br><i>And I am feeling so small<br>It was over my head<br>I know nothing at all<br>And I will stumble and fall<br>I&#39;m still learning to love<br>Just starting to crawl<br><br>Say something, I&#39;m giving up on you<br>I&#39;m sorry that I couldn&#39;t get to you<br>Anywhere, I would&#39;ve followed you<br>Say something, I&#39;m giving up on you</i><br><br>From the first time I heard it, this was a perfect fit for a very specific scifi story that as far as I know doesn&#39;t exist. It&#39;s essentially the Downer Ending version of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Martian_(film)">The Martian</a> - a desperate scramble to rescue a stranded crew/ship, where all of humanity&#39;s efforts just... aren&#39;t enough.<br><br>Even more specifically, I&#39;m imagining an AU film where NASA noticed the damage to the space shuttle <i>Columbia</i>... once it was already in orbit. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2016/02/the-audacious-rescue-plan-that-might-have-saved-space-shuttle-columbia/">There is an article</a> about how, through sheer fluke, it would have been just possible to save the crew - provided everything went right. Well, in my film, it didn&#39;t, because space is actually hard.<br><br>(I mean, in theory you could use it if they managed to save <i>most</i> of the crew but not the one we&#39;ve been focussing on - a la <i>Armageddon</i>. Maybe that&#39;s more viable?)<br><br><b><a href="http://www.metrolyrics.com/hello-lyrics-adele.html">Hello</a>, by Adele</b><br><br>Sample lyrics:<br><br><i>Hello, can you hear me?<br>I&#39;m in California dreaming about who we used to be<br>When we were younger and free<br>I&#39;ve forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet<br>There&#39;s such a difference between us<br>And a million miles<br><br>Hello from the other side<br>I must&#39;ve called a thousand times<br>To tell you I&#39;m sorry<br>For everything that I&#39;ve done<br>But when I call you never<br>Seem to be home<br><br>Hello from the outside...</i><br><br>&quot;A million miles&quot;. That&#39;s about three times the distance from the Earth to the Moon - or just about exactly the distance to Lagrange points 1 and 2, the points on the line between the sun and earth where satellites can be placed &#39;stationary&#39; in space.<br><br>This is very clearly a song from someone who&#39;s living on orbit, at one of the Lagrange points, and radioing back to Earth (from their California-themed holodeck or something, or maybe they&#39;re on California Orbital). &quot;The world fell at our feet&quot;. &quot;Hello from the outside.&quot; And that&#39;s <i>clearly</i> the plot of one of those classic SF novels - a Heinlein, maybe? Or a Bradbury? I&#39;m not sure which story it is, but I&#39;m positive there&#39;s a story which fits this song perfectly.<br><br>(Alternately, <a href="http://project-apollo.net/mos/mos432.html">&#39;a million miles is the difference between failure and a new chance&#39;</a>, but the song doesn&#39;t fit that story. It&#39;s still a charming expression, though.)<br><br>So that&#39;s mine. What&#39;re yours?<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Picture this... A great city stands besieged, it&#39;s outer defences lie broken and it&#39;s few defenders are tired after so long fighting. Everything to the east of this city has been either captured or destroyed by the great army that has come from even further east, sparing no one. The city has called for allies and yet none have arrived. Today the enemy are so close to breaching your final layer of defences and destroying all that you hold dear when, to your surprise a loud horn echoes across the plains. From the north comes a great army of allies, all united in their quest to help defend your city and defeat this great army from the east. <br><br>If you stood with these allies to the north you would see that numerous though they were, they were still not numerous enough to outnumber your foes. But still they march towards them, utterly fearless. The enemy from the east turns some of their forces to meet your allies while the rest try to break your defences one last time. You stand strong, emboldened by the sight of your allies arriving. Whilst your allies infantry push against the enemies, you notice on a hill a large gathering of cavalry forces, the largest gathering of cavalry forces ever known to man. Led by their king the cavalry force charge into the enemy breaking their positions and making them run for their lives. You sally forth to meet your allies and succeed in utterly routing your foe and saving the West. <br><br>Almost sounds like the Battle of Pelennor Fields does it not? Except it is not. The year is not 3019 of the Third Age it is 1683, and the city? Vienna not Minas Tirith. For on this day 334 years ago the Polish Winged Hussars lead the largest cavalry charge of all time (18,000 men) to break the Ottoman Empire&#39;s forces and relieve Vienna from the two month siege it had found itself in. That is not to say the Holy Roman Empire did nothing, their infantry were vital to push the Ottomans back and their cavalry charged alongside the Winged Hussars.<br><br>But overall the battle of Vienna, and indeed the entire centre of Europe and possibly beyond could have been lost to the Ottoman Empire. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75zmIj_4LFQ">Then the Winged Hussars arrived</a>.<br><br>Novastorme</p>

            <p>I kinda feel like the entirety of Fall Out Boy&#39;s album &quot;Save Rock and Roll&quot; works as a soundtrack for a story about supervillains, especially if you make The Phoenix the opening track and Young Volcanoes the end credits theme.<br><br>Also Rob Zombie.

            <p>Reading the article, there&#39;s a lot of &#39;obviously&#39;s, and no evidence. <a href="https://www.the-tls.co.uk/s3/tls-prod/uploads/2017/09/p16_Gibbs1.jpg">This</a> is the picture that accompanies the article, which purports to interpret two (uncited!) lines of Voynich script. In order to do so, he&#39;s separated out the lines, and then freely interpreted the imagined letters as Latin shorthand.<br><br>He&#39;s also interpreting the same symbol as multiple different words. Check out the one that looks like a swirly comma (last character in the first row on the image); in the first two words of the last line, that is interpreted as both &#39;cum&#39; and &#39;con&#39;, interpreted as <i>cum</i> and <i>confundo</i>. Remarkable!<br><br>Furthermore, he interprets ~80 characters as representing ~54 Latin words; he&#39;s extrapolating &#39;Aromaticus&#39; from &#39;AR&#39; (which doesn&#39;t look a thing like &#39;AR&#39;); and his numbers would make the entire manuscript well over a hundred thousand words, all written in illegible shorthand. A shorthand that uses a mere 25 characters to convey... well, according to the sample, the same words over and over. I suppose that&#39;s fair. De radicus seminis ana J, indeed.<br><br>Nah. Call me again when it&#39;s peer-reviewed rather than appearing in the Times Literary Supplement.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Apparently the real author of My Immortal, Rose Christo, is a pretty great author now. I recommend looking her up on Amazon, and especially checking out her books, especially <i>Why the Star Stands Still  and her memoir <i>Under the Same Stars. I would recommend the Suddenly Space Pirates series as well, but I just looked and it seems to be out of print sadly.</i></i></p>

            <p>Hello, everyone! My name&#39;s Wasted Moth, and I am returning to the Board after I-don&#39;t-know-how-long. Finally!<br><br>Yes, that&#39;s returning, because I used to go under the pen name of Dark Brother 16. Here&#39;s an explanation (which I probably don&#39;t need to provide, but which I will give anyway, because I feel like it).<br><br>Back when I was Dark Brother 16, I hung around the Board a while, and every now and then, I tried to get Permission, but could never really manage it. I then took a break to focus on going to college. I am currently in my Senior Year, but I will now occasionally be able to post here.<br><br>As for my previous attempts at getting Permission, I&#39;ve learned a few things from them, most notably what NOT to do. For the time being, I&#39;ll continue learning what NOT to do by reading random badfics, as well as expanding my literary horizons. And in the meantime, I&#39;ll only seek permission when I have good ideas.<br><br>As an aside, a little &quot;survey&quot; is in order. For those who have read them, what are your favorite books written by Stephen King? I&#39;ve been looking to expand my reading into horror.</p>

            <p>Dark Tower is and always will be my favorite Stephen King work/works.  More of an epic than horror though.<br>It (the book by that name, not the aforementioned series) is also good. New movie just came out.<br>The Shining is a classic and it more recently got a sequel in the form of Doctor Sleep.<br>Insomnia was a very good read and is, IMO, underrated, and ties into Dark Tower--similarly to The Stand, another good one, but better-known.<br>&#39;Salem&#39;s Lot ties into Dark Tower as well but is more horror than that.  I&#39;m currently reading Needful Things and loving it so far.<br>King&#39;s short fiction is good too--The Langoliers is nightmarish, and I really enjoyed The Library Policeman.<br>By the way, you can enjoy any of the DT tie-ins I&#39;ve mentioned above without reading DT.  It&#39;s more easter eggs and in one case DT ties up a loose end in one of those.</p>

            <p>My absolute favorite King novel (of the ones I&#39;ve read so far) is <i>From a Buick 8</i>.  It&#39;s a bit more sci fi/cosmic horror rather than Gothic horror, but the horror elements aren&#39;t really the focus of the story anyway.  It&#39;s a very character-driven, dialogue-heavy story about a group of good people who suddenly find themselves interecting with, and trying to keep control over, an inexplicable object that doesn&#39;t seem to follow the laws of space or logic, and shows how they come together to cope with it.<br><br>Also, while King&#39;s novels are all very well known names, I have to recommend trying some of his short story collections.  I actually think he&#39;s much better at writing short stories than novels, as he has a major talent for setting up scenes and characters in very few paragraphs and leading all the action up to a big punch in the end.<br><br>—doctorlit, a Kingly fanboy</p>

            <p>is that, long long ago, we reanalyzed the &quot;bie&quot; in &quot;newbie&quot; as a suffix on &quot;new&quot;, and then started applying it to other stuff that made sense, getting us &quot;oldbie&quot;, &quot;returnbie&quot;, and so on.<br><br>And now Ix has shown up with neat-sounding etymologies that might not be super true (that is to say, first I&#39;ve heard of this).</p>

            <p>&#39;Bie&#39; coming from &#39;Border-in-Existence&#39; is a backronym; the actual history is much more interesting. Pronounced <i>Bee-yeah</i> (yup, you&#39;ve been saying it wrong all this time, just like &#39;meme&#39;), it comes from the Albanian word for a decline or collapse. (I think it came into English by way of a tiny failed Soviet era revolt - instead of things like the Prague Spring, Albania had the Bie Revolt, which lasted about two days. But don&#39;t quote me on that, we might have had it earlier.)<br><br>Its usage on the internet was, as you say, first in &#39;newbie&#39;; it literally means &#39;everything is rubbish because of the new people&#39;. The idea is that the presence of the new causes the decline which was the original meaning of the word - thus, &#39;oh no, more newbies!&#39; (remember that one? Ah, the heady days of flash animation...).<br><br>The extension of its use in the PPC to &#39;oldbie&#39; and &#39;returnbie&#39; is partly self-effacing joke - &#39;we all make things rubbish, not just the new people&#39; - and partly an attempted reclamation of the term. Just like we&#39;re trying to make the world of fanfic a better place, we will make being a -bie - old, new, or return - something to be proud of, not ashamed.<br><br>hS, oldbee-yah</p>

            <p>[Put on Internet Historian hat]<br><br>Well, I can&#39;t verify that first part, but the negative connotations surrounding newbies trace their roots all they way to the origin of the Internet itself, with Newbies blamed for just about anything. Any large enough community will develop its own newbie mythology.<br><br>On Usenet, this manifested itself in manners such as the &quot;September&quot; meme (although they were not called that at the time), seguing into the idea of the &quot;eternal september&quot;, and a burning hatred of AOL, among other things. On 4chan, it&#39;s Summer and the summer[CENSORED], as well as other new[CENSORED], and constant demands on blatantly new users to &quot;lurk moar&quot;. In many gaming communities, it appears as general attacks on &quot;noobs&quot;, and a general expectation that they will complain about &quot;hacking&quot;.<br><br>But in every community large enough, you should expect disdain for anyone foolish enough to reveal, either explicitly or through their mannerisms, that they are new.</p>

            <p>... I went through the archives to see if there were any patterns in the use of -bie words. Here&#39;s what I found:<br><br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/MH5adN5.png"><br><br>[&#39;2008&#39; runs from 18th June; &#39;2017&#39; ends on 19th July; &#39;(Posts)&#39; has been divided by 500,000, with actual values running from 6093 (2017) to 22873 (2015).]<br><br>I think those spikes this year all come from one particular thread, so they can probably be ignored. What <i>can&#39;t</i> be ignored is the rise in the use of &#39;Returnbie&#39;. It&#39;s been wandering steadily upwards since first appearing in &#39;13, and I have no idea why. I guess that&#39;s when someone coined it, and it&#39;s just been picked up by more and more people ever since?<br><br>(&#39;Middlebie&#39; also includes &#39;Midbie&#39;, by the way; the two terms enjoy roughly similar currency, except for in this year.)<br><br>For the record, the highest actual count of &#39;Newbie&#39; uses is 578, in 2013; it only showed up 130 times in the whole of 2009, by comparison. &#39;Oldbie&#39; is much lower, ranging from 16 (2009) to 76 (2012).<br><br>Anyway... graphs!<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>... but it actually goes back to the early stages of the Board/Chat divide.<br><br>This would have been late &#39;05, early &#39;06, when it was becoming increasingly obvious that something was rotten in the Chat.

            <p>This was the old days, when we were mostly fine with the Board and Chat being virtually separate manifestations of the idea of &#39;PPC community&#39;, rather than two parts of the same community. Some people I met on Gatherings - Doc Filth in &#39;04, Dor in Philly - I&#39;d never even seen on the Board, and that was fine. It&#39;s only the people who were in both communities that really saw it as a problem.<br><br>The shift, by the way, can be seen through the growth of other community spaces, and how they were presented. Check out the profile for the LJ comm - it&#39;s very clear that it&#39;s ancillary to the Board. FlamingoFeathers&#39; backup Board, Araeph&#39;s and my Manual, July&#39;s Wiki - they were all tied to the /Board/, not the general concept of PPCishness.<br><br>It kind of ties into the rise in power of the Permission Givers, too. Why do you think we started electing them on the Board? Right - so that they&#39;d be a feature of the Board, not someone you could just hit up in the Chat.<br><br>I wouldn&#39;t call it a conspiracy - that would imply active collusion - but Bodldops, FF, Newmoon, Araeph, the PGs pre-me... make no mistake, they all had the same goal in mind.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I mean, to this day, the Board and the Chat have different cultures. They&#39;re similar, but they remain noticeably different.<br><br>...Also, your post seems to imply that there was more to the story of IRC&#39;s death than merely the stated fall into disuse. Which is also interesting.</p>

            <p>My general advice would be to try and keep the dialog for your characters as realistic/natural as possible without making it too weird or obvious. Other than that, research always helps. Research of the canon, obviously, is a must, but also, it helps to research the conventions of the fandom you&#39;re writing for. This can help you come up with material that hasn&#39;t been used before (or is rarely seen), and it can help you toy with the usual fanfic tropes, which is fun.</p>

The TV Tropes page of Pet Semetary was enough to give me nightmares, though, so maybe try that one if you haven&#39;t already?</p>
