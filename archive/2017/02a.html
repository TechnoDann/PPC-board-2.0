I&#39;m a Newbie here! <br>*sips coffee*<br>I&#39;m a fan of the PPC (obviously), and would love to eventually write my own PPC Agents.<br>*sips coffee*<br>I have one question: how can I adopt a mini-balrog? (though I really would like a mini-baragog.)<br>*sips coffee*<br>Want some coffee? I have lots of virtual coffee. <br>*sips virtual coffee*<br>See? Smell the exquisite 1s and 0s.<br>*sips coffee*<br>Can someone give me a plover? Or a pet Boromir? *drools* Pleeeeaseeee, preeety pleeeeeeeeeeaseeee. I&#39;ll treat them very well.<br>*sips coffee, drools about Boromir*<br>Ahhhhh.<br>*sips coffee, slaps face*<br>Sorry about that. On a more sane tangent, I&#39;d like to recommend a Legendary Goodfic. I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;m allowed to do this, but this fic fits all the criteria. I&#39;m recommending &quot;The Skipper&quot; by LinzRW.<br>*sips coffee, clears throat*<br>Now, the criteria... It&#39;ll be five years old in December. I turned up four results about the fanfiction itself on the first two Google pages when I searched &quot;the skipper fanfiction,&quot; plus an additional three hits for the author&#39;s blog. It is the second most reviewed Lord of the Rings fanfiction on FF.net, with 3,988 reviews (and 1,010 faves!). Lastly (bonus!), if you search &quot;Ana Stonbit fanart&quot; you will get a good deal of results; heck, I searched for fanart of her weapon and got a result.<br>*tries to sip coffee and realizes that he&#39;s out, cries*<br>She is also *sob* the opposite of a *sob, hic* Mary-Sue. <br>*finds and sips hot chocolate*<br>If you hadn&#39;t noticed, I ramble.

            <p>I&#39;ve recently been working with this very information, and <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Category:Minis">every mini article</a> on the wiki should have information about how to adopt that mini in its infobox. For a lot of them it&#39;s just &quot;try asking on the Board,&quot; but in the case of mini-Balrogs, there is actually <a href="http://c5s-ppc-agents.livejournal.com/6497.html">an adoption center</a>! You should ask there; or if that fails, try cassie.dramateacher at gmail dot com.<br><br>Now, I&#39;m not sure if you meant to say you also want a mini-Aragog or if you were being silly and/or looking for some sort of terrifying Balrog x Acromantula hybrid.

<li> Would someone be kind enough to repost a list of all of the accusations currently levied against Glarn?<br><br>2.  This is a big one.  Are we seriously trying someone in absentia?  Is that really the kind of thing we want to do?  All I see are some logs from the chat.  And frankly in my opinion only a handful really seem to be discipline worthy, and none in my opinion at this point are ban worthy.  I do not think it is fair for us to decide this without input from the accused.  Every other vote that I am aware of since I have been here he have allowed the accused to speak for themselves.  Why is this different?  <br><br>So I will go ahead and levy my vote.  I say nothing more severe than a warning.  We should not be making any kind of decision that could lead to a ban, whether immediate or in the future, without giving the accused to a chance to defend themselves.</li>

            <p>Dunno about 1); that&#39;s Tomash&#39;s business. <br>As things stand w.r.t. 2), we&#39;re not &quot;trying&quot; anybody — this is not a court — nor are we meting out punishment, or anything like that. We&#39;re simply debating the community&#39;s reaction to someone being rather unpleasant. About that, it seems that most people seem content to warn Glarn — if he returns — that he will be watched closely, and banned if he&#39;d misbehave again.<br></p>

            <p>About two days ago, I emailed GlarnBoudin, letting him know about the discussion and vote, so that he&#39;d have a chance to participate in the conversation and give his side of the story.<br><br>He replied as follows:<br><blockquote>
<br>I&#39;ve been fairly busy working on my own projects, and I haven&#39;t really been visiting the PPC discussion board very often.<br><br>I also earnestly apologize for the thing with the RP; I legitimately wanted to apologize both in and out of character, and I really should have stopped a while ago.<br><br>I have a really dark sense of humor, and I apologize for not realizing that the PPC Discord wasn&#39;t the place for it sooner.<br><br>Honestly, I think that I&#39;m probably gonna leave the PPC for a while, take a hiatus to cool off. Carnage has his own home now - a kaiju universe where he can have his own adventures - and, well, not to be rude, but-ah, screw it, I&#39;m gonna be rude. You guys aren&#39;t nearly as interesting as I thought you&#39;d be. I respect what you do, but seriously, you folks are kinda sticks in the mud, adopting a distinct &#39;git gud&#39; mindset concerning fanfics. I still haven&#39;t forgotten your reactions to my work - that is, grabbing your metaphorical torches and pitchforks because Ix skimmed it and didn&#39;t like it. Yeah, yeah, you lot are probably gonna pick apart my argument, but eh, heck with it.<br><br>TL;DR Screw you guys, I&#39;m going home.<br>
</blockquote>
<br><br>I wasn&#39;t sure if this was meant to be addressed to me or the community, so I asked him if I could post his words on the Board, and if he had anything else to add. He responded with:<br><blockquote>
<br>It was addressed to everybody. Sorry, I should have clarified that.<br><br>And no, there isn&#39;t really anything else I want to say other than, well, to lighten up, maybe ease up on calling what is and isn&#39;t a Sue when you&#39;ve got bloody Time Lords all over the place. I might pop in from time to time to deliver some badfic, but I&#39;m probably going to be gone from the community for a while.<br><br>And so, I return to the Pit of Voles from whence I came.<br><br>The end....<br><br><br>OR IS IT?<br>
</blockquote>
<br><br>For context:<br>1) Carnage was one of Glarn&#39;s agent concepts<br><br>2) The conversation about Glarn&#39;s badfic alluded to in the emails did occur. However, I believe his summary of events is rather inaccurate. If anyone wants to see the logs, let me know, and I&#39;ll go find them.<br><br>- Tomash</p>

            <p>As an outsider and an acquaintance of his elsewhere, and having now read these messages, I wish to change my vote to &quot;Option 1 but with a 3-month ban if he causes trouble again&quot;, as with everyone else. I say this partly because I actually didn&#39;t want to be a part of all this initially. Looking back, it was probably my instinct to try and help people I regard as friends in times of adversity that led to me getting dragged in, and knowing that I could easily got caught in the crossfire, and that my efforts didn&#39;t make that much of a difference in the thick of things, I may have been better off remaining silent. Maybe.<br><br>That being said, it&#39;s good to see that Glarn has apologized for his behavior, or at least I hope that&#39;s the case - and in fairness to him, I took a second look at that story, and I feel that once you get past the... questionable elements, it actually makes for quite am interesting read, and I at least believe his efforts to justify the events. This of course does not mean I approve of how he behaved on the chat - he has creative potential, I can say that much, but he has yet to understand how to be respectful to others or to handle concrit, which is similar to how I was back when I caused no shortage of infuriating mayhem back in the day. Well, I was even dumber and didn&#39;t see sense until far too late, but still.<br><br>That being said, I also appreciate that Glarn is willing to take the time off to do his own thing and at least in his view, not have to conform to standards for a place he barely visits anyway. We aren&#39;t an obligation, and I know a few Boarders have just dropped off due to Real Life or their own projects, including some I know via PM. (And come to think of it, I haven&#39;t posted any new PPC writing pieces myself since last November, and that may or may not have anything to do with the fact that I start up my part-time job next week, and I swear Dad&#39;s keeping me away from the Internet on purpose for the sake of preparations!) I still think being blunt and flippant about such a critical situation isn&#39;t exactly wise or tasteful, but since it does seem like Glarn is leaving on his own volition, as I suspected, I don&#39;t think that really matters.<br><br>Glarn, if you ever read this, I hope you know that I harbor no hard feelings towards you for this or all the previous difficulties we had on the PPC chatroom. Opting to leave a tense situation before things escalated is a choice I should&#39;ve made a long time ago during that disastrous group project, and it&#39;s a relief that you&#39;re willing to back down, hopefully to take the time to understand yourself a little better. I hope you&#39;re learning from this experience as much as we are, and I&#39;m still holding out on the possibility that you may be able to come back to see us when you&#39;re older and wiser. For now, though, best of luck with your fiture endeavors, and I hope we can still keep in touch on DeviantArt and Tumblr, at least.</p>

            <p>I can understand anyone being reactive and defensive in a real-time situation with lots of people questioning your work. That&#39;s one thing.<br><br>Coming back the next day and throwing a fit, though? Not so much. Especially when everyone has repented and apologized, AND the questions and critiques were perfectly valid, as far as I can tell. Unfortunately, I don&#39;t know <i>RWBY</i> or <i>StarCraft</i>, so reading the fic myself wouldn&#39;t do me any good, but if both the characterization of the main protagonist and the mechanics of the main antagonists are in question by people who DO know the continua, I call that a pretty shaky premise for a crossover.

            <p>What about just inserting the word &quot;harasses&quot; in Article 1?

            <p>Which I&#39;m going to name as &#39;the Harassment Amendment&#39;, though it&#39;s expanded waaaaay beyond that scope.<br><br>My aim here is threefold: firstly, to work harassment into the opening articles; second, to improve the structure of the opening articles; third, to get &#39;stop when you&#39;re told to&#39; into the Constitution.<br><br>In doing this, I ended up adding 5 Articles, 2 Sections, and completely reworking the first half of the Constitution.<br><br>Please pick this apart and change it, all at once or piecemeal (including changing things back) - none of it is set in stone. Please note that I&#39;ve added a couple of questions after proposed Article 11, which I think the community really needs to offer an opinion on.<br><br><hr>
<br><br><b>Section One: On Toleration And Its Limits</b><br><br><b>1.</b> The PPC community is a tolerant and welcoming place. It is a home to people from all walks of life, with wildly different opinions on all manner of topics. Its members are proud to be able to discuss even difficult and controversial topics without falling into fighting. It is a place where everyone is respected as a person, regardless of who they are. All respectful opinions are treated with respect, whether they come from a newbie or someone who&#39;s been here fifteen years.<br><br><b>However:</b><br><br><b>2.</b> The community will <u>not</u> tolerate any individual or group who intentionally discriminates against, abuses, persecutes, or otherwise attacks others in any way, shape, or form, for any reason. This includes, but is not limited to discrimination on the basis of sex, race, ability, national origin, sexual orientation, gender identity, and religion.<br><br><b>3.</b> The community will <u>not</u> tolerate the use of language which evokes any form of discrimination or persecution. The subjects mentioned above, and others which cause genuine suffering (such as rape, murder, abuse, and mental health issues) should be discussed with sensitivity. Even &#39;joking&#39; about these subjects is Not Funny; ‘it was just a joke’ is not an excuse - it’s self-incrimination.<br><br><b>4.</b> The community will <u>not</u> tolerate any form of harassment between members of the PPC, whether it manifests as attacking, bullying, or pestering. Respect people&#39;s personal boundaries.<br><br><b>5.</b> Those who engage in intolerable behaviour forfeit their right to respect; however, not warranting respect does not mean they do not warrant politeness. This means you are not allowed to descend into flaming and insulting them, but instead should follow Article 10 and the other provisions of the Constitution.<br><br><b>Section Two: On The Capacity To Engage In Mature Conversation</b><br><br><b>6.</b> Do Not Flame. You are allowed to disagree with people, but Do Not Flame. There is a distinct difference between &#39;I don&#39;t agree with your opinion and I think that your theory is factually wrong&#39; and &#39;You&#39;re an idiot and your opinion is built on lies and stupidity&#39;. If you find that you&#39;re hurling insults around, just stop. This even (or perhaps especially) applies if you consider yourself to have been wronged by another community member. If it’s a misunderstanding, a flame is an unwarranted attack. And if they’re deliberately trying to provoke you, attacking them is exactly what they want - and damages the community as a whole. ((Current Article 2, as written.))<br><br><b>7.</b> We encourage respectful, friendly debates here. Someone disagreeing your opinion is generally not an attack on you, and should not be taken personally. Should a debate escalate into personal attacks, flaming, or any form of disrespectful conduct for any reason, everyone involved should step back and calm down before continuing. If this cannot be done, it may be best to abandon the conversation entirely. ((Current Article 4, as written.))<br><br><b>8.</b> If someone says something that seems offensive, but you’re not sure exactly what they meant, ASK them first, before jumping down their throats. Astonishingly enough, most people aren’t out to offend anyone. (If they are being deliberately insulting, believe me, you’ll have a lot of backup.) Don&#39;t be afraid to ask what someone meant - it isn&#39;t silly to want the full facts. Then, if there has been an honest misunderstanding, accept your mistake and move on. Apologies for making a mistake, and for being unclear, are recommended, but should not be demanded. ((Slight tweaks to second-to-last sentence.))<br><br>((The mimes have been thrown permanently into the pit to create a joke later.))<br><br><b>Section Three: On Making Reparations</b><br><br><b>9.</b> If you believe someone is doing something wrong, it is important to tell them clearly and calmly what the unwanted behavior is, why it is unwanted (i.e. how it violates the Constitution and/or is offensive), and that they are being asked to stop. Shouting or snapping at people does not usually help, so it is generally best to address the issue sooner, with a clear head, rather than later, with lots of built-up frustration and anger. ((Per Nesh, with slight tweaks.))<br><br><b>10.</b> Everyone deserves an honest second chance – which means, initially, a chance to stop, explain, and/or apologise. This means that, if you believe that someone is engaged in any violation of the Constitution, but particularly Articles 1-4, it is critical to make sure they understand what they are doing wrong, so that they can make amends. Explain it to them yourself, or ask a third party to do so – but the key word is explain. Telling someone to shut up because their opinion is unwanted does not constitute a chance. ((Current Article 7, as written.))<br><br><b>11.</b> If someone or multiple someones have asked you to stop what you&#39;re doing, especially on the basis of the Constitution, take a step back. Stop and look at what you are doing or saying. Take the time to think about it - the PPC isn&#39;t going anywhere. Remember the foundation of respect that the PPC community is built on (see Article 1). If there is good reason for their requests that you stop, then apologise - it doesn&#39;t even hurt a little! It is always acceptable to explain yourself if you&#39;ve made an honest mistake – we all do sometimes! – but please make sure that explaining why it happened once or twice doesn&#39;t turn into making excuses for why it <i>keeps</i> happening. In cases of persistent rule-breaking, may be invoked.<br><br><i>((Article 11 is partially cribbed from Nesh&#39;s suggestion, with big changes. In writing it, I ran into multiple questions I needed to ask:<br><br>1/ In the past, &#39;I&#39;m sorry the thing I said offended you even though I didn&#39;t mean it to&#39; has been a highly unacceptable response. What sort of apology are we asking for here? A simple &#39;sorry I said that&#39;? What if you think the thing you said isn&#39;t something you should apologise for saying - say, if it&#39;s your religious belief?<br><br>2/ Nesh&#39;s suggested version presupposes that you&#39;ve actually done something which you <i>should</i> be told to stop. What if you haven&#39;t? Article 5 [current] / 8 [this proposal] says that the person doing the accusing should apologise for their mistake - but Nesh has proposed that the person being accused should <i>also</i> be apologising. I think this needs serious clarification. It also has relevance to:))</i><br><br><b>12.</b> Wilful ignorance is not an excuse. If someone is ignoring the Constitution and claiming that they’re not really doing anything wrong - despite explanations to the contrary - that may constitute using up their chance. However, wilful ignorance on the part of the accuser is also not an excuse. If someone clarifies a genuine misunderstanding, continuing to push for an apology may count as persecution on your part. ((Article 8 as written.))<br><br><b>13.</b> If you find it impossible to get along with another member of the PPC, you can take it up in private e-mail. However, the rules of civility and respect do not disappear outside PPC community spaces, or while talking about someone. Don’t engage in bullying behaviour, and don’t say anything about another PPCer you wouldn’t say to their face. Harassing others by private means is just as serious as harassing them in public, if not more so, and will be treated as such - which means that if you find yourself being harassed or bullied by another PPCer, please make the community aware! We cannot help with a situation if we don’t know it exists. ((Article 9 as written.))<br><br><b>14.</b> The PPC as a community is responsible for upholding the Constitution. If following Article 10 doesn&#39;t resolve a situation, any and all uninvolved community members have a responsibility to back up the person who is in the right, or to defuse an unclear situation. It is never wrong to ask a third party to comment on a dispute, but try to find someone uninvolved; a mediator will be more useful for resolving a dispute than a supporter. ((Article 10 as written.))<br> <br><b>14.5.</b> If discussion is unable to resolve a situation, persistent rule-breakers can be shunned or told to leave the PPC community. We don’t want to do this - so if you&#39;re being accused of breaking a rule, take a step back and, if you are in the wrong, stop, apologise, and move on. Grudges are no fun! ((Article 10.5 as written.))<br><br><b>Section Four: On Sweet Mercy That Was Heavy</b><br><br><b>15.</b> Wow. That was some seriously heavy reading, but it was important stuff. You still with us? Good! The rest isn&#39;t quite as intense, so it should be a breeze for you. As a reward for making it this far, here&#39;s a recording of a mime artist&#39;s interpretation of <i>Hamlet</i>.<br><br>... oh, wait. Never mind.<br><br>((Sections 5-8 are sections 3-6 as written.))<br><br><hr>

            <p>Article 11, question 2: That&#39;s a tough one, yeah. While lots of apologies builds goodwill, which is nice, if the person being accused really hasn&#39;t done anything wrong it seems rather twisted to expect them to apologize. Well, perhaps an &quot;I&#39;m sorry for the misunderstanding&quot; would be <i>courteous</i>, but it seems like a bit more than basic politeness. Something like Level Two politeness, or maybe even Level Three. And advanced levels of politeness are hard, especially if you&#39;ve just been arguing (and if you&#39;re a teenage nerd with still-developing social skills, as I believe many of us are), and seem like a lot to require within Da Rules. Maybe we should put together an article on Politeness (like <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=305292;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">the article I suggested on Apologies</a>), or something.<br><br>Minor quibbles:<br><br>Article 9: Does &quot;sooner&quot; really mean &quot;with a clear head&quot;? Don&#39;t people often say things they regret in the heat of the moment? I think this section would be clearer without the references to &quot;sooner&quot; and &quot;later,&quot; just referring to the person&#39;s level of upset-ness, or else clarify. . . or am I being silly?<br><br>Article 11: In case of rule breaking, <i>what</i> should be invoked? Did you leave out a word? Or did you mean that this article may be invoked in case of rule-breaking. . . Yeah, you did, didn&#39;t you. Maybe put this sentence first, or tweak the phrasing.<br><br>Article 15: I like the idea of introducing some levity, but this shows a serious lack of knowledge as regards the <i>Hamlet</i> fandom (maybe fandom isn&#39;t the right word. Body of tradition? Anyway). The idea of a recording of a mime performing <i>Hamlet</i> isn&#39;t that funny, because the play has an intrinsic association with mime. It started in Shakespeare&#39;s time, when plays sometimes began with a &quot;dumb show&quot; -- a shortened, mimed version of the whole play. <i>Hamlet</i>&#39;s play-within-a-play has one, so the play itself tends to get given one too, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wAZhFzATkQ">spawning</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQIzaDEm08c">many</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z96rAb2O_-s">school</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7PuPuoX1JY">projects</a>. . . of varying quality (student productions are the Shakespeare fandom&#39;s version of fanfic; most of them are terrible)(<a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10891592/1/May-Violets-Spring">Not that we don&#39;t have fanfic</a>, <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10658411/1/Redemption">also of varying quality</a>). Basically, there&#39;s nothing unusual about a mime interpretation of <i>Hamlet</i>, and there are altogether too many recordings in this genre.<br><br>--Key protects her fandoms, even when the canon&#39;s probably taken near-irreparable damage <br><br>P.S. Speaking of <i>Hamlet</i>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNLWBr4GGPM">this</a> is a thing of joy.</p>

<li>Hm, I had hoped that &quot;with a clear head&quot; would clarify that &quot;sooner&quot; doesn&#39;t mean <i>immediately</i>, in the heat of the moment. What I was going for is basically &quot;don&#39;t just ignore it and hope it will go away and then get mad and eventually snap when it doesn&#39;t,&quot; cuz I&#39;ve seen that happen plenty of times.<br><br>Any thoughts on how to put that more clearly?<br><br>11. Y&#39;know, looking at it again, I think the current wording of this does preclude the idea of apologizing if you&#39;ve done nothing wrong. It deliberately sets up a scenario where people are saying &quot;Hey, person, what you&#39;re doing is offensive/against Da Rules, you should stop.&quot; Breaking the rules pretty well does mean you should apologize. And then hS put in the bit that says &quot;<b>If</b> there is a good reason,&quot; which... actually, I find that&#39;s bugging me a little bit, since the purpose of this article is to outline how to gracefully recover if you&#39;ve gotten into trouble. It&#39;s not about what to do if people are jumping on you for no reason. I think trying to discuss that scenario here, or building in a sort of escape route (&quot;But I don&#39;t think I did anything wrong!&quot;) muddies the waters.<br><br>Also, this isn&#39;t something I think we can put into the rules without some dangerous implications, but it is worth remembering that a community dictates what is and is not acceptable to it. As many people have commented over the years, we do things quite differently to most of the Internet, so what&#39;s acceptable most places may not be acceptable here. To some degree, it&#39;s really on the person joining this community to learn its mores and adapt, whether it&#39;s explicitly required of them or not. Nobody gets to waltz into a new place and expect it to conform to their desires. So, if members of the community are telling someone that their behavior doesn&#39;t work for us, that is our prerogative. If you find the climate doesn&#39;t suit you, there are plenty of other communities to join.<br><br>There are, of course, crucial limits to this idea, which is why I don&#39;t suggest trying to encode it in the rules anywhere. It&#39;s just something to think about.<br><br>~Neshomeh</li>

            <p>I had a ridiculous example here, but let&#39;s be constructive instead. ^_^<br><br>Here&#39;s a proposed sketch for the first three sections of the Constitution:<br><br>Section 1: What&#39;s offensive and intolerable. Articles 1-5.<br><br>Section 2: What&#39;s just bad manners. Articles 6 (flaming) and 7 (disagreement), and possibly pulling up the trolling article.<br><br>Section 3: What to do about any problems. This breaks down as follows:<br><br>a) Check you&#39;re not misreading the situation. Article 8, possibly changed to be slightly less snarky.<br><br>b) Calmly explain what the problem is. Article 9, probably with some editing of the sooner/later section.<br><br>c) If you&#39;re being accused, stop, think, understand what&#39;s being said, and apologise if an understanding can&#39;t be reached. Article 11, possibly with some of the misunderstanding stuff from 8.<br><br>d) Wilful ignorance is not an excuse - ie, just because they <i>say</i> they don&#39;t understand a clear explanation, doesn&#39;t mean they get to keep doing it. Article 12.<br><br>e) Everyone gets Their One Chance, and every effort should be made to resolve disputes peacefully. Combination of Articles 10 and 14.<br><br>f) Banning. Article 14.5.<br><br>What this does is set up a clear progression across Section 3. In fact, I&#39;d like to start each of its articles with a clear &#39;If... then...&#39; statement. <b>If</b> you think someone is violating the Constitution/being offensive. <b>If</b> you are convinced the situation isn&#39;t a misunderstanding. <b>If</b> you are being accused of stuff. Etc.<br><br>The one orphan under this setup is Article 13, the email one. I think this might slot into Section 2, but... do we actually want to say &#39;if someone&#39;s harassing you, send them an email!&#39;? I think the &#39;private email&#39; part can probably be dropped, or maybe thrown into the try-to-resolve-things part. That means it&#39;s just the &#39;be civil by email&#39; part that drops into Section 2.<br><br>Combined with an &#39;How To Apologise And Not Irritate People&#39; article, I think this handles both my questions, and a lot of what&#39;s bothering people in the thread. If someone else agrees, I&#39;ll throw together a remade version for discussion.<br><br>((And to think, I was supposed to have <i>stopped</i> trying to Fix Things...))<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>My point with the last bit of my last post is that a large enough portion of the community saying something is bad and they don&#39;t want it kinda does make it true. That&#39;s what the Constitution really is: the community setting standards for what it will and will not allow.<br><br>It&#39;s also about making those standards <i>standard</i>, not arbitrary, though, so:<br><br>I support pulling the trolling bit up into Section 2.<br><br>I like the progression you&#39;ve outlined here for Section 3.<br><br>I think we&#39;re looking to have in there somewhere that you are expected to apologize if a) you&#39;ve unjustly accused someone OR if b) you&#39;ve been justly accused of something; BUT NOT if c) you&#39;ve justly accused someone or if d) you&#39;ve been unjustly accused (though it might be helpful to apologize anyway). This can be discussed in more detail in the proposed wiki article, which I also support. It strikes me that it might be kin to how to give constrictive criticism, just of behavior, not writing.<br><br>What&#39;s just or unjust will have to be determined on a case-by-case basis, or the document will smother itself in text.<br><br>Article 13 is a bit of an odd duck, yeah. I <i>think</i> it&#39;s supposed to deal with situations where a couple of Boarders get into an extended debate that isn&#39;t particularly on topic and doesn&#39;t necessarily involve anyone else? &quot;Let&#39;s continue this over e-mail&quot; is often a great choice there; but not if it&#39;s gotten nasty. Maybe that&#39;s something for &quot;On Thy Topics of Discussion&quot;?<br><br>I think &quot;harassment outside the community (e.g. by e-mail) is just as serious as harassment inside the community&quot; may fit best up in Proposed Section 1, Article 4.<br><br>So basically, we&#39;d be breaking up Article 13 and possibly making a new article down in Current Section 4.<br><br>(Is that everything? I think that&#39;s everything...)<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Okay, here&#39;s the latest version for comments. References are to <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=305243;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">this version</a> where appropriate.<br><br><b>Section One: On Toleration And Its Limits</b><br><br>Articles 1-3 as reference.<br><br><b>4.</b> The community will <u>not</u> tolerate any form of harassment between members of the PPC, whether it manifests as attacking, bullying, or pestering. Respect people&#39;s personal boundaries just as much as you do everything else about them. This rule particularly includes interactions outside of PPC community spaces: harassing someone by email is just as serious as doing so in public, if not more so, and will be treated as such. If you find yourself being harassed or bullied by another PPCer, please make the community aware! We cannot help with a situation if we don’t know it exists. ((Merger of Articles 4 and 13.))<br><br>Article 5 as reference.<br><br><b>Section Two: On The Capacity To Engage In Mature Conversation</b><br><br>Article 6 as written.<br><br><b>6.5.</b> The rules of civility and respect do not disappear outside PPC community spaces, or while talking <b>about</b> someone. Don’t engage in bullying behaviour, and don’t say anything about another PPCer you wouldn’t say to their face. ((The leftover piece of 13.))<br><br>Article 7 as written.<br><br><b>8.</b> Trolls (those who create deliberately bad/annoying stories, reviews or comments for the express purpose of irritating or enraging others) will be ignored or mocked for entertainment. That includes PPCers who act as trolls — you have been warned. It is not clever to deliberately antagonise others in the community, and it is not clever to crow about antagonising people <i>outside</i> the community, either. ((Old Article 27, as written.))<br><br><b>Section Three: On Making Reparations</b><br><br><b>9.</b> <u>If</u> someone says or does something that seems offensive/inappropriate, remember that they most likely didn&#39;t intend to. If their words are ambiguous, go ahead and ask for clarification - it&#39;s never silly to want the full facts. Nine times out of ten, it&#39;s an honest misunderstanding by one or both of you - accept your mistakes and move on. Apologies on both sides (for being unclear, and for assuming worse than was meant) are recommended, but should not be demanded. ((Tweaked Article 8 from reference, to remove combatative language.))<br><br><b>10.</b> <u>If</u> you believe someone is genuinely doing something wrong, it is important to tell them clearly and calmly what the unwanted behavior is, why it is unwanted (i.e. how it violates the Constitution and/or is offensive), and that they are being asked to stop. Shouting or snapping at people does not usually help, so it is generally best to address the issue as soon as you are able to do so clearly and calmly, rather than later, with lots of built-up frustration and anger. If you feel honestly unable to explain the issue, it&#39;s always fine to ask a third party to step in. Ensure that the person you&#39;re concerned about gets a clear explanation of what they did wrong - not just denunciations. ((Article 9 from reference as written, with clarification on how soon &#39;soon&#39; is, and incorporating parts of Article 10.))<br><br><b>11.</b> <u>If</u> someone or multiple someones have asked you to stop what you&#39;re doing, especially on the basis of the Constitution, take a step back. Stop and look at what you are doing or saying. Take the time to think about it - the PPC isn&#39;t going anywhere. Remember the foundation of respect that the PPC community is built on (see Article 1). If they&#39;ve misunderstood you, explain that - as per Article 9, nine out of ten disputes are honest misunderstandings. But if there is a foundation to their request, stop and apologise. If you made an honest mistake, or weren&#39;t aware that what you said was offensive - we all do it sometimes! - it&#39;s always acceptable to explain after your apology (not as part of it!). Just make sure that explaining <i>why</i> it happened once or twice doesn&#39;t turn into making excuses for why it <i>keeps</i> happening. ((Article 11 from reference, massively changed. I&#39;ve referenced back to Article 9 to get the &#39;misunderstanding/mutual apologies&#39; stuff back in. Whether you think they have a point or not, both articles you read (9 and 11) should link to the Wiki &#39;Apologies&#39; article.))<br><br><b>12.</b> Wilful ignorance is not an excuse. There comes a point when someone who is ignoring the Constitution and claiming that they’re not really doing anything wrong - despite explanations to the contrary - needs the book thrown at them. However, wilful ignorance on the part of the accuser is also not an excuse. If someone clarifies a genuine misunderstanding, continuing to push for an apology may count as persecution on your part. ((Article 12, tweaked to remove a reference to the One Chance, which hasn&#39;t yet shown up.))<br><br><b>13.</b> Everyone deserves an honest second chance, starting with the chance to stop, explain, and apologise. If that&#39;s enough to resolve the dispute, excellent! If not, you could try asking a third party to comment on the dispute. Do your best to find someone uninvolved; a mediator will be more useful for resolving a dispute than a supporter. Some issues may be best sorted out by email, or by agreeing to drop the subject. Almost no-one in the PPC will be deliberately trying to antagonise, upset, or offend you. ((Merger of articles 10, 13, and 14.))<br><br><b>14.</b> The PPC as a community is responsible for upholding the Constitution. If following the above rules doesn&#39;t result a situation, any and all uninvolved community members have a responsibility to back up the person who is in the right, or to defuse a difficult/unclear situation. Genuine rule-breakers should be made aware that their behaviour will not be tolerated, however justified they think it is. ((Article 14, tweaked a little.))<br><br><b>14.5.</b> If discussion is unable to resolve a situation, persistent rule-breakers can be told to leave the PPC community. We don’t want to do this. If the community tells you that you&#39;re not living up to its standards, listen to them! Take a step back, take the time to think, take the trouble to sincerely apologise. If you learn from your mistakes, and don&#39;t hold a grudge over them, you can continue to be a productive member of the PPC community. ((Article 14.5, reworked for a bit of positivity.))<br><br>Later on, as the last Article in <b>On Thy Topics Of Discussion</b><br><br><b>XX.</b> Sometimes, a discussion between just a few people takes on epic proportions. If this happens, it might be best to take it to the Lounge, or to private emails, rather than consume the Board with your enthusiasm.<br><br>At the end, Article 27 has been stolen for use as Article 8, and the final Section is renamed <b>On What Are You Waiting For?</b>.<br><br><hr>
<br><br>I think I&#39;m pretty happy with this version; it covers everything I think needs covering, and does it clearly enough that most disagreements can be cleared up. And since I&#39;m the only person in this community, I hereby amend the--<br><br>Wait, what? I&#39;m <i>not</i>? Ohfine. ^_~ Edit away to your hearts&#39; content.<br><br>hS</p>

The second parenthetical remark could be confusing. Does explaining not as part of your apology mean in a separate post, or what? I think &quot;after your apology&quot; is sufficient, perhaps even more than sufficient, mostly because I think &quot;I&#39;m sorry, I had no idea that was offensive!&quot; and &quot;Oh, I never knew that. I&#39;m sorry!&quot; can both be perfectly valid apologies even though they include out-of-order explanations.<br><br>Suggested rewrite:<br><br><i>If you&#39;ve made an honest mistake, or weren&#39;t aware that what you said is offensive, it&#39;s always acceptable to explain after your apology.

            <p>On your other point: I can&#39;t pretend to know why the chat community didn&#39;t raise this as a problem earlier. The only experience I can work from is my own, which you can read over in the previous thread if you choose. Essentially, the word &#39;harassment&#39; has different meanings to different people. To me - and to the Constitution as presently written - it means &#39;repeatedly attacking, bullying, and demeaning someone&#39;.<br><br>That wasn&#39;t the sense in which Iximaz and Tomash were using it; their version is also accurate. But bear in mind where you are - the PPC has never been noted for consisting of highly-stable, socially-adept types. A large proportion of us are frankly inept when it comes to interpersonal skills (such as, say, me).<br><br>So yeah, I think it&#39;s actually reasonable to assume that some of our people - which includes members down to and below age 13, many of whom are awestruck by the presence of Big Names like Iximaz - aren&#39;t going to get that &#39;try and be wherever Iximaz is and talk to them all the time&#39; is a form of harassment. I don&#39;t know whether that&#39;s the situation with GlarnWhatsit, but it feels like it.<br><br>My view has always been that the best way to prevent bad behaviour is to make it clear that it <i>is</i> bad, in advance. Cut things off at the start, and you never have to resort to punishment.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>But since there are apparently some issues, I would have said:<br><br>Should Article 9 say &quot;sooner, still with a (mostly) clear head&quot; to clarify that it does not suggest to act rashly when already upset?<br><br>Article 11, Question 1: Since it&#39;s probably too complex to put into the constitution, I support the suggestion of a Wiki article on &quot;Apologies&quot;.<br><br>Question 2: What? The last sentence of Article 5 (now 8) means only the accuser should apologize? I always felt that this goes both ways and apologizing for having caused trouble is also recommended to the accused person. Mutual apologies are the best way to resolve misunderstandings. Does this really need a repetition here? Or a clarification in new Article 8? Also, may we want to add &quot;or unaware of cultural dissonances&quot; to &quot;being unclear&quot;?<br><br>But now this clear progression thing looks even better, so go ahead and do it.<br><br>HG</p>

            <p>I think it&#39;s much more clear and progresses easily from one point to the next. The bases seem to be pretty well covered.<br><br>On your questions:<br><br>1. I think there&#39;s a difference between &quot;I disagree with you and my opinion hasn&#39;t changed, but I&#39;m sorry for offending you anyway [because I care about your feelings]&quot; and &quot;I&#39;m sorry you were offended even though I&#39;m totally still in the right [therefore you&#39;re stupid for feeling that way].&quot; The former should be acceptable while the latter is not. But yeah, it is a fairly tricky matter of word order and tone, which has also given us no end of trouble. I think I said something at some point to the effect that a decent apology should be for the hurt/offense given, because the point is to show that you respect the other person and didn&#39;t actually want to hurt them. It also helps to say that you&#39;ll try to avoid doing/saying whatever it was in the future, &#39;cuz it shows you understand the problem and do want to get along. Maybe something like that could go in as a sub-clause of Proposed Article 11? Though I don&#39;t think it would be wise to dictate &quot;All apologies must take this exact form or else,&quot; so... hrm. Maybe someone else can solve this one.<br><br>2. I don&#39;t think there&#39;s anything wrong with both parties apologizing for a misunderstanding. It takes two, after all, and if everybody cares enough about everybody else&#39;s feelings to say they&#39;re sorry for hurting them even if it was an accident, that&#39;s great. {= )<br><br>I think what we&#39;re looking for here is humility enough to accept that we can always be wrong and kindness enough to put the other person&#39;s feelings over our own. It&#39;s embarrassing to make a mistake, and being challenged or called on it can make us defensive and angry, but our feelings are not more important than everyone else&#39;s. We should help each other realize that making a mistake is not necessarily the end of the world, so we can let it go. This gets proportionally more difficult the more important the thing you&#39;re wrong about is to your identity, but there are only a few things that really ought to be that big a deal, I think, and they&#39;re pretty well covered in Proposed Articles 2 and 3.<br><br>I think I&#39;ve strayed from the point of the question, though. My sense is that if someone has honestly done nothing wrong and someone else is jumping on them, that sort of thing usually gets nipped in the bud pretty quickly. It may not need clarification. But others may have other ideas.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I think that runs afoul of the &#39;intentionally&#39;, plus it doesn&#39;t explain what we mean by &#39;harasses&#39;. As shown in the previous thread, I interpreted it as &#39;engages in bullying-style behaviour towards&#39;, and that reading is implicitly supported by Article 9.<br><br>Putting it another way, this conversation:<br><br>OlderThanThou: Hey, Lacksi! Quit harassing Oaken (= replying to everything she says and name-dropping her in every post).<br><br>Lacksidacksical: That&#39;s unfair! I&#39;m not harassing (= bullying, insulting, and attacking) Oaken, and saying I am is a personal attack!<br><br>Both OTT and Lacksi are 100% correct, and furthermore Lacksi isn&#39;t doing <i>anything</i> intentionally - she&#39;s just kinda obsessed with Oaken. ((Note: because this is Lacksi&#39;s character, not as a stand-in for GlarnBoudin, whose motivations I don&#39;t know.))<br><br>I <b>do</b> like the idea of slotting it in like that, but I think we need to be clear what the word means. How do you feel about &#39;pester&#39;? It&#39;s a little lighthearted, but I think the connotations are closer to what we&#39;re talking about.<br><br>Re: &#39;stop means stop&#39; - where it impinges on the Constitution, I think this is covered by parts of articles 5, 9, and 10.5 (the various &#39;if you&#39;re told you&#39;re doing something wrong, check whether you are and stop&#39; clauses). Given that it <i>is</i> scattered around so much, I think it&#39;s somewhat diluted - might a restructuring of Section 2 to give &#39;what to do if you&#39;re being told off&#39; an article of its own?<br><br>If you&#39;re worried about &#39;I don&#39;t like your opinion so shaddup&#39;... urm, then I don&#39;t think there&#39;s much we can do. The old Constitution went with &#39;don&#39;t tell someone not to share their opinion&#39;, and that was thrown out (on the grounds that, eg, the opinion &quot;homosexuality is sinful&quot; is not allowed to be shared). I think we considered having a list of Protected Categories, but decided that would just lead to rule-lawyering - &quot;oh, but income <i>isn&#39;t</i> protected, so I&#39;m allowed to say that all poor people are scum!&quot;. At present, we have &#39;not limited to&#39; and &#39;such as&#39; in article 1, which avoids the previous two issues, but opens up room for &quot;your opinion that spiders are cute is harmful (because I&#39;m Australian and spiders are deadly) so you should be banned!&quot;.<br><br>((There was actually an episode of a children&#39;s TV show banned in Australia because it taught that spiders are super friendly and harmless...))<br><br>I think we have to have a certain level of trust in the PPC community.

            <p>I don&#39;t think we can fit in pestering up there, either, then. It&#39;s quite a different concept, and might needs its own article if we feel it&#39;s not covered enough by the various iterations of &quot;be respectful&quot; and &quot;if you&#39;re told you&#39;re doing something wrong, knock it off.&quot; <br><br>I do think we could do with &quot;how to tell someone off politely and constructively&quot; and &quot;what to do if you&#39;re being told off.&quot; It is necessary to be clear when a behavior is unwanted. We don&#39;t always like to be direct about it, but it should always be okay to say &quot;Look, I don&#39;t want this attention. It makes me uncomfortable. Please stop.&quot; So, let&#39;s see...<br><br><b>New Article 7.</b> If someone is doing something wrong, it is important to tell them clearly and calmly what the unwanted behavior is, why it is unwanted (i.e. how it violates the Constitution and/or is offensive), and that they are being asked to stop. Shouting or snapping at people does not usually help, so it is generally best to address the issue sooner, with a clear head, rather than later, with lots of built-up frustration and anger.<br><br><b>New Article 8.</b> Everyone deserves an honest second chance – which means, initially, a chance to stop, explain, and/or apologise. This means that, if you believe that someone is engaged in any violation of the Constitution, but particularly Articles 1-3, it is critical to make sure they understand what they are doing wrong, so that they can make amends. Explain it to them yourself, or ask a third party to do so – but the key word is <b>explain</b>. Telling someone to shut up because their opinion is unwanted does not constitute a chance.<br><br><b>New Article 9.</b> If someone or multiple someones have asked you to stop what you&#39;re doing, especially on the basis of the Constitution, you are expected to stop and apologize for giving offense. This also applies if you are told that your behavior is making someone uncomfortable: as per Article 3, you are expected to exercise respect for others, and this includes personal boundaries. It is always acceptable to explain yourself if you&#39;ve made an honest mistake – we all do sometimes! – but please make sure that explaining why it happened once or twice doesn&#39;t turn into making excuses for why it <i>keeps</i> happening. In cases of persistent rule-breaking, [Current Article 10.5] may be invoked.<br><br><b>New Article 10.</b> =Current Article 8.<br><br><b>New Article 11.</b> =Current Article 9.<br><br>Etc.<br><br>How do those sound?<br><br>Possibly some of the other articles in Section 2 may need tweaking to avoid redundancy, but then again, a little redundancy may not be a bad thing.<br><br>~Neshomeh<br><br>P.S. Yes, I think so. {= D</p>

            <p>The PPC began sometime before March 2002. We know this, because <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/658458/1/Clan-of-the-Cactus">they were on their fifth spinoff by then</a>.<br><br>The very <i>very</i> early PPC community was actually populated by OFUM fans - I think Miss Cam must have been one of their first supporters. In fact, I think the community itself consisted of the FF.net reviews and the OFUM Yahoo group.<br><br>Then J&amp;A got kicked from FF.net (in <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/658458/4/Clan-of-the-Cactus">May 2002</a>, and Philosopher@Large set up a homepage for them (<a href="http://twistedskein.webs.com/PPCHome/index.htm">it&#39;s archived here</a>. At the time, they had 14 missions up - everything through to &#39;Sisterhood&#39;.<br><br>The Board was up within the year. We have a single archived front page from December, which spans post numbers 321 to 404 (in six days). Assuming that rate is constant, you get a foundation date around November 10th. That&#39;s probably slightly later than actual (since the number of posts would&#39;ve been growing), but the Internet Archive shows it <i>didn&#39;t</i> exist on October 8th (as in, it wasn&#39;t on the Oddlots homepage).<br><br>People started to flood in. It started with those who had seen the PPC on FF.net - my wife is one of those [/namedrop]. Then it was people who saw the spinoffs. By May 2003, the Board was <b>huge</b> - the archives show we were racing through the Front Page every single day.<br><br>Sometime at the beginning of &#39;03, Acacia left. We have <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1X10LUeMFmSMt4d027MwkJzGH4aAMOFxwWYVkjlw4kX4/edit#gid=0">a fairly big archive</a> of subject lines from &#39;03, and she doesn&#39;t appear in them. Jay (as Otik) kept posting until at least August, and then left herself.<br><br>I joined the Board in September, ultimately by way of OFUM. So good timing on my part! I saw Jay come back a couple of times, which was exactly as overwhelming as you can imagine. And I&#39;ve been here ever since.<br><br>I realise this is a longer reply than you were expecting, but it&#39;s good to drag out the ol&#39; history books every so often. I usually find out something new - this time it was that October 8th date on which the Board <i>didn&#39;t</i> exist. Fun stuff.<br><br>hS</p>

On June 3, I point Mulberry (Jaz and Tick&#39;s author) toward Jay and Acacia&#39;s Wunderlust account as a way to find the &quot;two sites for the PPC.&quot; I was reading the likes of &quot;Just Call Me Mary Sue&quot; and &quot;I, Grûsbálk&quot; and had caught up to the latest chapter of HFA (chapter 21) in January, and apparently then went on to read OFUM, and I know I got to the PPC by way of the OFUM mailing list.

            <p>Really, I only started writing for the Internet around 2005-2006ish - in fact, <i>Mai Dire Fine</i> (started April 13th, 2006), the story Agent!Sergio and Nikki are actually from, was also one of my earliest involvements in fanfiction.<br><br>...

            <p>I&#39;m not sure where it should cut off, though. I already coined &#39;Originalbie&#39; earlier, which I think should cover anyone who became active when TOS was still being written. The hard cut-off date for that is August 12th 2003 - according to <a href="http://twistedskein.webs.com/PPCHome/index.htm">Oddlots</a>, that&#39;s the publication date for &quot;To Know Where You&#39;re Going&quot;. That means Kaitlyn (first attested date: May 18th) would definitely qualify, which might make me reconsider the definition. ;) Maybe try and peg it to the last J&amp;A mission, &quot;Elemental Crystals&quot;, though I&#39;m having trouble dating that one.<br><br>I don&#39;t think the rest of us fall into that category, though.

            <p>We also have the term &#39;Middlebie&#39;, which was used at one point. If you accept that &#39;Newbie&#39; stands for people who haven&#39;t really learned the ropes yet, &#39;Middlebie&#39; is anyone who&#39;s settled in but isn&#39;t of the &#39;wow they&#39;ve been here ages&#39; set. Say, six months for newbies, then another 12 for middlebies.<br><br>I think I remember occasional use of &#39;Olderbie&#39; to cover people who&#39;ve been here longer than most Oldbies. But that still doesn&#39;t give us a great deal of granularity...<br><br>Working from the Feb &#39;05 date, the next big change is in 2008, when the Board switched from Server.com to YourWebApps.com. 2008 was kind of a big year in general - we had so many Emergencies and the like that you can really call it a cut-off. Either you were there, or you weren&#39;t. Hmm... can we call the people Who Were There veterans? It breaks the chain of -bies, but lets us introduce that extra level. After all, the time since &#39;08 is, uh, nearly a decade - we can&#39;t have that all under one name.<br><br>So Olderbie and Oldbie now cover 2008-2015: some 7 years. Hmm... by a helpful coincidence, the Constitution was rewritten in early 2012. The Wiki was updated in May, so let&#39;s call it that.<br><br>-Originalbie. 2002-August 2003.<br>-Ancientbie. Aug &#39;03-February 2005.<br>-Veteran. Feb &#39;05-June 2008.<br>-Olderbie. Jun &#39;08-May 2012.<br>-Oldbie. May &#39;12-September 2015.<br>-Middlebie. Sept &#39;15-September 2016.<br>-Newbie. Sept &#39;16-February 2017.<br><br>There! With that set of names, you can pin anyone down to within four years, and most people to much less than that. :D Other than the fact that there&#39;s no -bie in veteran (Veteranbie?), I think it&#39;s perfect.<br><br>hS<br><br>((This is all in fun. In practice, &#39;newbie&#39; and &#39;oldbie&#39; are all that&#39;s ever likely to be used. But I&#39;m a very sad person who has very sad fun.))</p>

            <p>Oy, newbie! Yeah, that’s right, come over here. You don’t need to be scared of a middlebie like me – it’s only a year ago I was standing right where you are, squeaky-clean boots and all.<br><br>Not that I’m saying you shouldn’t be scared at <i>all</i>, mind. You know those stories you heard about the Tsarina, how she secured her throne by cutting down every single other claimant, everyone else who knew the Great Ones before they ascended to glory?<br><br>Yeah, it’s true. Every word, and more that don’t even get said.<br><br>But most of us ain’t scary. Us middlebies, well, we’re just ordinary folks like you and the other newbies. Even the oldbies – yeah, they’re good at what they do, and you’ll learn a lot by watching them, but they’re basically just doing their jobs.<br><br>But the olderbies, <i>they’re</i> intimidating. People like Desdendelle and Sergio are so far beyond even the oldbies that they make… well, they make me feel like you. You listen to them, you do exactly what they tell you, and you thank your lucky stars they’re not telling you <i>off</i>.<br><br>And you <i>are</i> lucky, newbie – we all are. The really big names, the proper veterans, don’t show their faces too much around here these days. But if you see them – if you run into the likes of JulyFlame or VixenMage - you salute, and you <i>mean</i> it. They served the Tsarina when you were still playing catch with the kid next door, and they’re… I mean, they scare the pants off some of the <i>oldbies</i>. Just stay out of their line of fire, kid.<br><br>O’course, however hard you try, you won’t be able to keep away from the Council of Five – no, it’s Three now, ain’t it? The ancientbies - <i>don’t</i> let them hear you say that, word to the wise – are here all the freaking time, they’re impossible to get away from. Huinesoron, Neshomeh, Delta Juliette – remember their names, and remember that there used to be five of them until Araeph and Elcalion… disappeared.<br><br><i>You</i> don’t wanna ellipsis disappear, do you? No. So watch your squeaky-clean tongue around ‘em, and keep your head so far down your nose scrapes the dirt.<br><br>Now look, I know I’ve made it sound pretty scary here, and honestly, it is. But it’s also the greatest job in the world. You’re in the service of Tsarina Kaitlyn the Magnificent, doing the work of the Great Ones, Jay and Acacia themselves. There’s no better place to be – and no better folks to be there with.<br><br>Welcome to the war, newbie. Welcome to the PPC.<br><br><hr>

            <p>It wasn&#39;t <i>that</i> long ago, though. Only... well, okay, a year and a half, but even so!<br><br>I think if there was more to write, it would be those campaigns I mentioned. Things like <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=12a1TnYNeebzroINo1Ti9vILHC-jLNJZCtMBg_64Busc">the Battle of Goldberg</a>, and other big community events. Your Emergencies and big crossovers would count - because multiple people were involved in writing them.<br><br>The trouble is, my list would probably run out around 2008. What Big Stuff has happened since then? It helps if it&#39;s stuff where the community as a whole feels like it won - arguments between ourselves where people on both sides are still around are more like internecine feuds, not proper campaigns.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I think ribbons for Plort and the Continuity Council would be appropriate. And the Blackout. And one for doing archival work? Other than that, I dunno. Annual ones for the Badfic and Shipfest games? One for being a signature on a constitutional amendment?<br><br>hS, ponderance</p>

            <p>Before we get onto the ribbons, there are two decorations which can be added to them:<br>-The Black Lace, indicating conspicuous service. I&#39;ll note what it specifically means for each ribbon where it&#39;s appropriate. (Filename: BlackLace.png)<br>-The Cactus, for multiple awards. These come in bronze (1 additional award), silver (5 additional awards), and gold (more than 8 additional awards, at which point we stop counting specifics).

            <p>Right. The very first thing I have to say is, hooray! Ellie&#39;s back with mum! This is definitely a good thing, and I&#39;m glad to see at least this part of Ave&#39;s trouble being resolved. The post-mission actually made me smile. Good for her. And good for you, Ixi.<br><br>Some of my favourite moments:<br><br>1) &quot;<i>“Sorry for the inconvenience, gents, but I have a baby to look after, so if you don’t mind lea—wait, what were you doing here, anyway?” [BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEP!]</i>&quot;<br>(You just haaad to go and say it, Ave. You just had to...)<br><br>2) &quot;<i>“No, but he sure got her on her back, if you know what I mean,”</i>&quot;<br>(Hiyoooooo!)<br><br>3) Actually, every time those two bloody muppets, Jack and Zeb, were playing matchmaker/teasing any of the Time Lords.<br><br>4) &quot;<i>The Aviator snickered. “So tell me, how does it feel to be on the receiving end for a change?”<br>“Is that what the Detective asked you the other night?” Zeb immediately shot back.</i>&quot;<br>(Booyah, lil&#39; buddy!)<br><br><br>That being said, the beginning felt a little... jumbled for me. One concrete example: Zeb asking how long the Time Lords have known each other follows by the Detective&#39;s answer to Jack&#39;s previously stated question. And Zeb&#39;s question is still hanging to AFTER the console going off and Ellie getting scared. It may not be a big deal, or anything, but it feels chaotic for me. Then again, that may just be me.<br><br>Another thing - not a negative one, but I am curious:<br>&quot;<i>“As far as I know, Eleven and River spent the most time together out of any of the incarnations” Jack said.</i>&quot;<br>Now I wonder, wouldn&#39;t that be with Twelve and their 24 years on Darillium?<br><br>Long story short, it was a solid piece of mission. Zeb&#39;s the MVP, as always, and has everyone else in his shadow. Jack and the Detective have good chemistry both with each other and the other team, and Ave... well, she&#39;s just her old, grumpy self. All in all, I am looking forward to next interactions between this lil&#39; semi-happy family.</p>

            <p>Firstly, I&#39;m glad you liked it! Elanor&#39;s Homecoming is something I was happy to see myself.<br><br>The chaos at the opening was intended, actually. Elanor&#39;s back, everything is peachy, and then the appearance of Jack and the Detective starts a downwards spiral. Ave is trying to get Elanor tucked in, Zeb is teasing both of them, Dee trying to get out of there, and Jack watching bemusedly. All of which is occurring simultaneously, so there&#39;s <i>gonna</i> be chaos.<br><br>I&#39;m glad it comes across, though.<br><br>As to your second, I must restore the reputation of my canonical expertise. <br><br>So, yes. :) You&#39;re right, those 24 years are the longest (confirmed) time of (consecutive) companionship between the Doctor and River. . . <br><br>But it&#39;s also irrelevant, because, as you said, they were, as far as we know, on Darillium for those 24 years, and so we weren&#39;t counting that particular period.<br><br>Still, I&#39;m glad it was a good read.

            <p>I love the interactions between these four, it&#39;s wonderful. The Aviator is one of my many favorite agents, and I love both of your writing styles. This fic really deserved to die too.<br><br><br>My tiny little nitpick is about the use of the phrase &quot;Time-Lord&quot; because technically, it doesn&#39;t refer to people from Gallifrey, just those who graduated from the Academy (and while not necessarily smart, smart enough to graduate) and earned their regenerations, and it would have been nice to see you charge the Sue with that. I don&#39;t know, it&#39;s a pretty minor thing overall and I can&#39;t remember if it&#39;s actually shown up in the show.</p>

            <p>And I think I&#39;m blushing over here. Am I blushing? •^w^•<br><br>As for the Time Lord vs Gallifreyan thing, they were only named as different  species in the expanded universe (namely, <i>Interference - Book Two</i>) but Time Lords were explicitly said to have evolved from Gallifreyans in <i>A Good Man Goes to War</i>, which is from the TV show (more widely accepted as the &quot;main&quot; canon).

            <p>Seeing how much it was taunted, it decided &#39;Welp, let see if it can turns into an actual relationship&#39;. Always fear the IO. Joke aside, character interactions were fun, and also let hope for more for them in the future. I also Daww&#39;d for the nursery inside the TARDIS...<br><br>The fic? It was horrible, and also a good pretext to put all of them together. Still fail to understand why people cannot see the direct relation you can make between &#39;purebloods&#39;, racism&#39;, and other words not fit for a civil discussion. Feels good seeing glitterbags like this being eliminated.<br><br>And now that other people than me are using &#39;glitterbag&#39;, would it be propesterous to add it to the Creative Curses page on the wiki?<br><br>On the nitpick side, the tracker... (partly devolve into rant).<br><br>Why couldn&#39;t it include more formulated warnings, like: &quot;[Glitter level is raising.] Singing is not a crime, but like I already said, obssessing about me isn&#39;t healthy at all. Beep, can you imagine if I was only able to &#39;beep&#39;? <br><br><i>&quot;Dude, mourning your loved ones is fine, stop thinking me being there makes it a crime/Beep.&quot;<br><br>&quot;See? I&#39;m just a Suvian, look the tracker is beeping.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Nonono, feeling emotions is fine, obesssing about me is bad, remember what FicPsych said./ Beep. Beep.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I&#39;ll never be anything else than a Suvian...&quot;<br><br>&quot;Great Maker in the Sky, why?/ Beep.&quot;<br><br>shudders</i> At least I&#39;d be a perfect torture device. A work of pure sadism, destroying any emotion and character development in a negative feedback loop. Thank the Maker He remembered why the C-CAD have these beeping screen for numbers and comments.&quot;<br><br>Still not a fan of that thing.</p>

            <p>As you may know already if you&#39;re active on the lounge, I&#39;ve been inspired to get permission after stumbling across a particularly squicky badfic. I&#39;ve developed my agents and written the permission pieces, so I would like to ensure they&#39;re up to snuff before actually making the request. For those of you who are active on the lounge, these are the same agents you&#39;ve seen in Rudi&#39;s.</p>

            <p>Uh, La Wunj exists on <a href="http://plort.wikia.com/wiki/File:UnionMap.png">the map of Plort</a>, way over in the east. And, uh, so does <a href="http://plort.wikia.com/wiki/File:RidingLocal.png">BTA&#39;s second holding</a>. What map are you looking at? :-/<br><br>If you mean there&#39;s nothing on there about the Discord, that&#39;s because as far as I know no-one&#39;s said anything about it other than &#39;the discord around La Wunj&#39;. It hasn&#39;t been named as a nation, so is currently classed as part of the Riding.<br><br>If that&#39;s not what you mean... then I don&#39;t know what you mean. :(<br><br>The next Council might get exciting - both Baron Araeph and Baron Cassie are missing in action, which&#39;ll leave a huge chunk of Borrd and the Riding unclaimed. Well, claimed by Phobos, more than likely.<br><br>Speaking of which: do we still feel we have enough active PGs? July&#39;s drifted off again, and neither PC nor Phobos post very much (they&#39;re still clearly <i>here</i>, but not very <i>active</i>. And obviously Kaitlyn remains super quiet. That puts the Very Active count at a generous six - you, me, Ix, Nesh, Juliette, and VM. Are some of them more active on the Discord?<br><br>I&#39;m aware that there&#39;s hardly the workload to need more than, like, two of us - but there wasn&#39;t in 2015, either, and the support for making more was pretty impressive. Do people (<i>not</i> just PGs) think we should be making hats for more people - either newer folks, or long-term members who&#39;ve grown to the point where they should have it?<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>... I&#39;m happy to update the maps to include it. What <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PHLGAKQb_cdHaqMUlvDvj0MIELT95LPpDWZec7w2Zzo/pub">I&#39;ve said</a> is that the discord is primarily centred on the city itself, with factions spinning up around it.<br><br>If I can offer a suggestion: it was decided that &#39;PPC Lounge&#39; would describe whatever the current chat happens to be. How about establishing La Wunj as a city-state, with hinterlands extending up the Bravneits and down the Chuneils? You could have the factions carving out bits of the landscape for themselves, or co-existing in blissful harmony under the enlightened rule of the Mords - or cutting lines through the city itself, if you wanted.<br><br>You&#39;d want to pick a name for the nation. &quot;The City-State of La Wunj&quot; would be simple, obviously, but it doesn&#39;t explicitly reference the name Discord. I don&#39;t have any particular ideas.<br><br>I&#39;ll work up a split map to show both halves of Thanasius&#39; holdings; shouldn&#39;t take long.<br><br>You&#39;re right that we don&#39;t need new PGs for the workload, but like I say, we didn&#39;t when you were chosen, either. You, Ix, and PC were elected because it was deemed unfair that &#39;Permission Giver&#39; was a title/responsibility/trust only given to super old people; we wanted to open it up to the newer members of the PPC. If the <i>new</i> newer people feel the same way, then it would be perfectly legitimate to add a couple more.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>So the City-State (name pending) is filled with people who use Dizzy Chord keystones to communicate. The various factions set up their own circles to coordinate their activities (whate&#39;er they may be). That hangs together, I think?<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>So, &quot;what to read next&quot; is a bit of a tricky question, partly because it depends on what you&#39;re interested in and partly because some folks have written a <i>lot</i> of good stuff, and I don&#39;t want to bury you in it. However, I can point you to a few highly-regarded spinoffs. Firstly, there&#39;s <a href="http://starshadowhall.tripod.com/ppc/">Neshomeh&#39;s missions</a>, which you should probably go read five seconds ago (you&#39;ll also see Phobos&#39;s stuff linked there, same comment applies). After that, I&#39;d also highly recommend  scapegrace&#39;s work (Notary &amp; Wobbles, Gabrielle &amp; Doktor Trollenfisch), Iximaz&#39;s work (Aviator &amp; Zeb, Ix &amp; Charlotte), Suicide &amp; Diocletian&#39;s missions (written by TungstenMonk). What I&#39;ve read of Huinesoron&#39;s stuff is also quite good, and you may want to check it out also. (I&#39;m personally also a fan of WarriorJoe&#39;s Fritz &amp; Silas, but that might just be my thing for aliens)<br><br>If you want profiles etc. looked over and/or checked for reasonableness, start (or latch on to) a beta request thread, and you&#39;ll probably get at least one person willing to work with you on them. We don&#39;t usually toss around public links to that sort of thing until it&#39;s good and ready, since that basically counts as publishing it (or requesting Permission).<br><br>If you&#39;re looking to get a better feeling for your possible future agents, I think one of the best ways to do it is (if your set of available times matches someone else&#39;s, US evenings tend to be very good) to RP with them in #rudis on the Discord. Unless you&#39;re not into that sort of thing, of course. There&#39;s also trying to write a few of the Permission prompts with them.<br><br>And my favorite color is green.</p>

            <p>One of my collab missions is officially on hold indefinitely as of today, due to my co-writer being unable to access the PPC community thanks to his Internet filter. To this end, I need to write another mission with someone else to replace it and prevent another bottleneck in my mission queue.

I also wrote a brief &quot;happy ending&quot; for her at the end of the mission.  This allowed me to (technically) write a Despatch mission without involving the real world author, and still treating the Sue as more &quot;normal human&quot; than usual.  Of course, not every SI-fic in every fandom would lend itself to a similar premise easily.<br><br>—doctorlit isn&#39;t against RPF missions conceptually, but plays by the community&#39;s rules</p>

            <p>The sort of fics that were missioned by the Despatch authors (Meg &amp; Will, I think) are <i>this close</i> to being clearly unacceptable mission material. Namely, these &quot;I plothole characters in for a sleepover&quot; sorts of plots are either RPF or very similar to RPF (depending on who you ask), and missions to them would be very likely to turn into author-bashing. And we <b>don&#39;t</b> author-bash. We also don&#39;t mission RPF anymore.<br><br>Furthermore, over time, we as a community have decided that walking right up to the border of unacceptability isn&#39;t acceptable either. This is a reason we don&#39;t go after religious fics (like Hogwarts School of Prayer and Miracles). The same reasoning effectively bars writing Despatch missions.<br><br>This means that writing Despatch missions is no longer proper. It&#39;s not that we&#39;ve explicitly forbidden it, it&#39;s just not something we think anyone should do. This (and the fact that it probably didn&#39;t come up before) explains why the wiki&#39;s not updated.<br><br>Since you&#39;re here, there are a few other matters I&#39;d like to continue on the front page. As you are certainly aware, there are noticeable issues with some of the missions you have previously published and your response to constructive criticism, as pointed out <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=305042;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board;pagemark=25">in an older thread</a> (and <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=305227;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board;pagemark=25">in this reply to that post</a>). I would like to know what your plans are for improving in the future and how you plan to act on the feedback you have received on your previous writing. As a specific point, what are your plans for making edits and revisions to your missions, especially your first one?<br><br>If you would prefer not to continue that conversation on the Board, my email is clickable.<br><br>- Tomash</p>

            <p>Hey Bram,<br><br>I beta read for you once, right before you got Permission. Now, I&#39;ve become pretty enthusiastic about beta reading, so since then I&#39;ve done a lot of research on how good editors work, and I realized I did a pretty shoddy, unhelpful job on yours. Instead of helping it become a better version of itself, I tried to make it into something it wasn&#39;t. I&#39;m sorry for that -- I do think your ability to work with a beta leaves something to be desired, but let&#39;s not forget that <a href="http://plotprotectors.tripod.com/TOS/">Jay couldn&#39;t &quot;deal with criticism (even good criticism)&quot;</a>. <br><br>Basically, I&#39;d like to have another shot at working with you; email me if you&#39;re interested. If you aren&#39;t, I understand.<br><br>--Key</p>

            <p>I have drawn your attention to problematic aspects of your interactions with the PPC community, and you have ignored me (and others) instead of responding to these concerns in a reasonable way. Your lack of significant responses has led me to provide further clarifications in the hope of reaching an understanding, which were not intended to harass you.<br><br>To go into more detail, I will summarize my views on this conversation:<br><br>- I observed that you were not behaving in an acceptable way, and that you were confused about why people were telling you this<br><br>- I wrote a post explaining what you were expected to do (especially with regards to constructive criticism and interactions with beta readers) so that you would better understand the norms of this group. <br><br>- You ignored my post and chose to shout at me instead<br><br>- I clarified my post further, telling you that promises of future reform were not enough, and that you needed to take action to repair your previous transgressions<br><br>- Instead of engaging with my points, you ignored them (again) in favor of expressing your feeling of being under attack.<br><br>- The thread fell off of the front page, so, when you made a new post, I replied to you, hoping that you would address my concerns, which you had been ignoring<br><br>- In this latest reply, you have again failed to demonstrate an understanding of what I (and others here) have a problem with, and what you need to do about it.<br><br>I hope this summary has made my perspective more understandable, and that it will help you understand why I am continuing this conversation.<br><br>As to your missions, let me be clear: they are poorly written. You are <b>required</b> (<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=18hztHpDehxcfrjaXoFUew1vb0BdZPDAusHxMHzHiCzM">Constitution, Article 24</a>) to improve them, paying attention to the constructive feedback you have received. The PPC is a community dedicated to good writing, after all. Your lack of a beta is <b>not</b> an excuse. Not here.<br><br>If they are &quot;beyond your ability to fix&quot;, you have two choices. You may either retract them from continuity and abandon them, or you may <i>gain</i> the ability to fix them. You have already received broad concrit on your missions, which should help you improve them. I recommend that you read it calmly and carefully.<br><br>You also ought to find someone willing to work with you to improve your writing skills. (I do have to warn you that you have a reputation with some of us as a difficult author to work with, and you may need to overcome that.)<br><br>I would like to know which of these options you intend to pursue, as taking no action in the face of these requests may cause the community to consider more formal consequences or rebukes. If you do not understand any part of what you have been told or what you need to do, please let us know so that we can help you participate in the PPC.<br><br>Again, my inbox is open.<br><br>- Tomash</p>

            <p>&quot;The Harry Potter Trollfic&quot; and &quot;Kelly Solos &#39;Little Treasure&#39;&quot; have never been linked on the Wiki, and the links on the Board are so far down that nobody will ever find them again if we just stop pointing, and the Newbies probably don&#39;t even know what we are talking about.<br><br>As far as I&#39;m concerned, these failed writing exercises have never been part of the PPC continuity – otherwise I would have linked them on the Wiki. Also, to me it looked like Bramandin, as soon as he was made aware that these stories don&#39;t fit our quality standards, and then again whenever it was brought up, tried to tell everybody that he did retract these stories, using phrases like &quot;beyond my ability to fix&quot; or &quot;don&#39;t intend to work on them further&quot;.   <br><br>So, the only problem here is apparently that Bram doesn&#39;t know how to formally retract them to our full bureaucratic satisfaction, and this fits our general knowledge about his condition. Actually, since this doesn&#39;t come up often, I don&#39;t know either, and I intended to ask Ix and Des when this came up the last time, but then I forgot. <br><br>What exactly should Bramandin do?<ul>
<li>Delete the Gdocs or at least protect them, so that nobody except Bram can read them anymore?<br>
</li>
<li>Say in very clear and unmistakable words that Yes, these stories were actually retracted in August resp. October 2016?<br>
</li>
<li>Something else?</li>
</ul>
<br>Having that said, I agree that running away and abandoning everything as soon as it&#39;s criticized to try and start something new is not a good way to improve one&#39;s writing. It irked me when zdimensia did it, and I&#39;m concerned that it happened two times in a row with Bram, but I&#39;m afraid that we are far beyond the point when somebody should have told him that.<br><br>HG</p>

            <p>As far as I&#39;m concerned, the two missions are, to some extent, part of PPC continuity until there is a clear statement to the contrary.

            <p>Hello! I&#39;m Khryssty - my goal in devising this screen name was spelling a fairly normal name as extravagantly as possible - and I just thought I&#39;d poke my head in and say hi. I&#39;ve been a casual appreciator of PPC works for some time now, and I&#39;d love to get involved with all of these great fellow writers.<br><br>Usually, in my free time, I write fiction or play video games. Recently, I actually finished something! Whoopee! I&#39;m still hammering away at a persistent motivation problem that I feel like I&#39;m making progress with.<br><br>I&#39;m enthusiastically committed to all things Versailles Philharmonic Quintet, especially involving the vocalist, KAMIJO, and I have this Huge Unifying Theory that ties together the lore of the band&#39;s songs with some things from KAMIJO&#39;s solo project to create this big honking backstory. Deranged, I know. I was probably a conspiracy theorist in a past life. I tried making it into fanfic once. It didn&#39;t work out at all. I might go back. Maybe. Unlikely.<br><br>I&#39;m also fairly knowledgeable in JoJo&#39;s Bizarre Adventure, MapleStory, Overwatch, and Undertale, and I have some other bits and pieces of fictional knowledge scattered about in my brain.<br><br>I&#39;m a high school student born and raised in the US of A. Feel free to send me questions, comments, or otherworldly virtual knickknacks, as I hear is the custom on this here Board.

            <p>It was a short story that takes place in an original setting of mine. I started out by trying to make the original setting into a book. It was great at first, but the more of it I wrote, the more it deteriorated in quality, so I&#39;m putting it on hold for now. In the meantime, I decided to write additional stuff in the same setting, possibly as an attempt to get a better idea of the flavor I was going for.<br><br>I wanted to submit it so I can apply to attend a forum for young writers that&#39;s happening this May, and I also passed it on to my school&#39;s literary magazine, which might give me a cash prize if I&#39;m lucky. I doubt it.<br><br>Basically, vampires exist alongside humans and have done so for some time, but it was really only until World War I that they made themselves known on a large scale, when Italy turned out to be a vampire state, and only in the mid-1980s, during the American &quot;Red Power&quot; movement, were Western vampires supported by formal institutions such as nocturnal schools and welfare programs that donate small quantities of blood to vampires in poverty. I&#39;m going for a sort of mix between differing ideas in the popular consciousness of what they&#39;re like; typically, they look, think, and behave just like humans, with only a fatal sunlight allergy and an addiction to blood, but if they go long enough without it, they snap and go nuts, mowing things down and clawing through anything that gets between them and their next meal.<br><br>The short story itself was just about this high-end restaurant that serves vampire customers.<br><br>Sorry for all the blather!</p>

            <p><i>Twilight</i> did it, and <i>Doctor Who</i>&#39;s done it at least once (&#39;Vampires of Venice&#39;). Maybe it&#39;s because some vampire fiction leans towards &#39;supernaturally pretty = long haired men&#39;, which harks back to Renaissance paintings?<br><br>Or maybe it&#39;s because Italy is inhabited by vampires. Do you often feel an urge to go out at night and drink red liquids? :D<br><br>hS<br><br>PS: <a href="http://www.nationalgeographic.com.au/tv/vampires-in-venice/">Apparently</a> they were part of the local legends up around Venice, which I guess is pretty close to the Slavic regions they&#39;re normally associated with. This is a wild guess, but your average early-20th-Century English or American vampirologist wouldn&#39;t have heard of Romania or Bulgaria, but Italy was a known quantity (and Venice is famous in its own right). So maybe that&#39;s why.<br><br>PPS: Or even more simply... the early vampire novels like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carmilla">Carmilla</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dracula">Dracula</a> feature creatures whose names end in vowels, which isn&#39;t all that common in English. Apart from simple, old-fashioned names like Anna or Joe, the first associations that spring up are things like Leonardo, Michelangelo, and all those other Italians/ninja turtles. Take that, add a hundred years, and you end up with Italian vampires coming out of the walls.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m not quite sure how I pushed through it, myself. Mostly, I just said to myself, &quot;what the hell, just vomit words onto the paper.&quot; The editing came later. I wish I had a more concrete method of getting myself to write.<br><br>MapleStory, I&#39;ve found, is a pretty cash-driven game unless you&#39;re on Reboot, the server where paying to win is inherently impossible (no Marketplace, no trading, a lot less in the Cash Shop) and the gameplay is more like pre-Big Bang MS. I spent $50 on pretty clothes to sell in the Marketplace one time to try and get money, and at the end, I wound up with one staff. Yep. One staff. I&#39;m definitely going to start looking into Reboot... Player dissatisfaction with Nexon is as high as it&#39;s always been after the trend towards needing real money to succeed, and not even Reboot is immune. Also, FIFTH JOB IS HERE!<br><br>Thank you for the jar of kimchi! My father actually used to work as a Korean linguist in the US Army. He still semi-regularly buys these big jars of the stuff from overseas.</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve read all of TOS, although it has been a while, so I&#39;ll probably go back and read through it again. Come to think of it, it&#39;s been a while since I read through any of the spin-offs, so I&#39;ll be stuffing my face with writing in the near future. I do like the work that Trojie and Pads have done together.</p>
