            <p>Thank you. I shall use this bookmark faithfully<br><br>I never actually posted any missions, and I am very embarassed by those agents in general, so that&#39;s probably for the best.

            <p>It&#39;s not a bookmark, it&#39;s an incredibly complex device that has been passed down the family line for centuries. It is an astoundingly complex, intricate mechanism, built of over a million gears and pistons and springs and engines and such. <br>It, er, makes a really good bookmark, but! But!<br>It makes a really good door-holder, too! And window-breaker!<br>Don&#39;t you forget that. <br><br>And I meant PPC spin-off! The sort of other stories that aren&#39;t from Jay and Acacia, is what I meant. <br>Spin-off is a really, really vague term, and, er.

            <p>I spent a solid five years looking for the second Septimus Heap book.

I probably should have. <br><br>I personally love time travel, and think Pseudonymous Bosch handled it pretty well, but I get that it&#39;s not for everyone (I wish I hadn&#39;t read the whole series though *grumble grumble* actually I liked it; I&#39;m just annoyed that my first-ever LO had to go get herself a boyfriend *disappointed small lesbian noises*).<br><br>Ayyyy, one can&#39;t not read the prequel! As for Chasing Vermeer, the big question: how many of the codes did you crack?<br><br>And Lemony Snicket&#39;s writing is pretty amazing. Yeah, it&#39;s settled; I have to read ATWQ. I&#39;ll probably do it this summer; I volunteer (high school requirement) in the children&#39;s section of the library, and they let me read on the job (befriending librarians is among the best life choices I ever made).<br><br>Okay, I also want to ask you about stuff I like that I got into post-fifth grade: Anything Susanna Clarke? How about Six of Crows -- it&#39;s kind of YA, I know, but it&#39;s <i>good</i> YA. Are you perhaps one of those wonderful people who treats Shakespeare as a fandom?<br></p>

            <p>I read up until the... somethingth book, and then there was time travel which turned me off because little me was more interested in the spells than the characters (whoops). I NEED TO READ CARRY ON (that&#39;s the gay harry potter one, right?)<br><br>I read the synopsis, admittedly, so was very confused, but I am definitely going to reread that at some point now that I remember it exists.

I went through a huge YA phase-- got into a highschool on the strength of an essay about how much I hated the last divergent novel :P <br><br>SHAKESPEARE IS A FANDOM AND DESERVES MORE FANFIC AND I LOVE HIM</p>

            <p>Yes, Carry On is the gay Harry Potter one. Specifically, Harry Potter falls in love with Edward Cullen and they go on a quest to save the world. And it&#39;s actually really good and infringes on no copyrights. I really like it. My friends like it even more -- one of them is one of the major bloggers for the Tumblr fandom, another has a copy which she&#39;s passed around and everyone she knows has read and written in it, we did a dramatic reading in a subway station. <br><br>It&#39;s complicated? Like, okay, being trans or gender-fluid or something is one thing, but now I&#39;m imagining a forbidden magic potion gone wrong, you angered a faerie, you knocked over the wrong vial while cleaning your friends&#39; lab, or a Disguise Generator was horribly broken (also I want to link to Baroness Delta Juliette&#39;s Plort coming-out story, but wiki not working on my computer so go find it yourself (you&#39;re a returnbie; you know how Plort works, right?) because it is good and when I think things are good I make people read them)<br><br>Or, okay, normal people use &quot;it&#39;s complicated&quot; when they <i>don&#39;t</i> want to talk about things. I&#39;ll drop it. <br><br>I might be a librarian (my plans for the future are extremely undecided). If we stay in touch you might get a librarian friend :P<br><br>If you get more invested in spells than people, you might not like Six of Crows; the magic is a little hand-wave-y (although I hear the companion series has more world-building) and while it&#39;s a tightly-plotted adventure novel, it&#39;s mostly about the characters figuring out what to do with their various traumatic backstories (warnings for almost everything)(okay that&#39;s not accurate, but yeah, lots of warnings). It&#39;s really well-done...but maybe not your thing. <br><br>Susanna Clarke, though, basically just writes about her world and system of magic, with characters as an excuse. A good excuse, but the pseudo-scholarly asides are the best part. <br><br>OKAY Shakespeare is the only fandom I write for on a regular basis and I have so much (for example) <i>Antony and Cleopatra</i> slash (that I need to just go ahead and publish already) so if you ever want to read anything I have everything because THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS TOO MUCH SHAKESPEARE FIC. </p>

            <p>Hey guys it&#39;s Skarmory&#39;s brother again and I figured I could use your help. <br><br>So you know the first Fnaf song from The Living Tombstone? I wasn&#39;t satisfied with the ending where it just cut off. So my solution was a rap bridge! Unfortunately I can&#39;t freestyle worth a damn so I thought I would turn to you guys. I extended the audio to accommodate the bridge too if you&#39;d like to hear it. Where would you want to have it uploaded? Thanks </p>

            <p>So I was given permission uh. <br>Three years ago now, I think. <br>And I had agents, and claimed a fic, and then um. RL happened and I sort of disappeared. <br>Those Agents are, in retrospect, kind of iffy. Also I&#39;m no longer interested in the Department of Angst. <br><br>I have some idea for Agents based on some terrible OCs I made who deserve actual personalities (Hi, my version of Victoria Holmes-Watson). <br><br>But yeah.

            <p>Hell, that&#39;s how Chris and Ami came to be in the first place. In general I agree with Neshomeh.

            <p>Knowing what your characters are in for and seeing how others have written their own agents will give you some ideas about what works generally, what interests you specifically, and what doesn&#39;t.<br><br>Taking a look at the <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Permission">Permission article</a>, if you haven&#39;t in a while, may give you some basic ideas about what we like to see in PPC agents. You could use some of the prompts just to practice and get a feel for your characters before you jump back into mission-writing.<br><br>Browsing through the various FAQ and Help articles on the wiki (second tab in blue top navbar) may provide some useful tips, too.<br><br>Also, I recommend <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/User_blog:PoorCynic">PoorCynic&#39;s series of workshops</a>, the first two of which are about creating characters and writing speech.<br><br>I hope some or all of that helps!<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>So I started a dungeon crawler RP on the T board near the end of November, and it&#39;s been slowly chugging along since then. Whilst I has my exams earlier in January I had to stop the RP because I couldn&#39;t find the time to keep updating it.<br><br>However, now I no longer have exams I&#39;ve put up a new post for the RP and I&#39;ve had... 2 responses. Thank you very much Ix and Granz for responding, however I don&#39;t feel I can really carry the RP on with just 2 people. Before I had to take my break I know Mattman and Aegis were regular posters, and so in part this is just a remind to them. It is also a reminder to the Alleb, SkarmorySilver, TheShyIon and Scapegrace who all created characters but have since become inactive. <br><br>The final point of this post (ATTN: Everybody else) is for those of you who aren&#39;t currently part of the RP, whether because you missed it when it was first announced, weren&#39;t here or whatever. Dungeon Crawlers is a post based dungeon crawling RP game done in rounds (of normally 48 hours), you don&#39;t need any  previous experience in Role Playing to join, it&#39;s set in its own unique universe (that totally doesn&#39;t draw some inspiration from Pathfinder and D&amp;D), and it is meant to be a fun, slightly comical experience. If anyone is interested, go to the T board and it is the 3rd (Third) thread down. We also use the Other RP channel on Discord for talking/RPing/stuff and even have our own unique role on there.<br><br>Storme Hawk</p>

            <p>Yeah, I know, very technical terms were just used. <br><br>Anyway, first up if you have any questions about the dungeon crawler RP feel free to contact me. I&#39;m available by email, here or on Discord (most of the time).<br><br>Secondly, when I first introduced the dungeon crawler RP idea to the board I also mentioned a Pokemon RP I had been working on at the same time. The Pokemon RP is now a lot closer to completion, and it will probably be completed in the next month or so. I am aware that there are lots of different RP things going on at the moment (my dungeon crawler, PTU, a couple of other RP things mentioned on Discord etc.) So I probably won&#39;t launch the Pokemon RP unless I see at least 5 people being really interested in it (and willing to participate in it), around the end of February when I reckon it should be complete, or after the dungeon crawler RP dies, whichever comes first. With the recent progress I have made with it I felt I should give an update on how it is doing, especially seeing as I remember there being quite a bit of interest in it when I first mentioned it.<br><br>Storme Hawk </p>

Plus, advice for what to put in there is always helpful, since I want to have their profiles and prompts done before I ask for permission. <br><br>Agent Lothar - A Chaos Space Marine from the Night Lords Legion, recruited after the badfic he was from was tackled by the DMS. He&#39;s adapted well to life as an agent, though not entirely to not being able to use his armour. Whilst he has been brought up to speed with pop culture, and has developed tastes of his own, he&#39;s still easily confused by more obscure references. Currently, he works in the Department of Floaters, due to his reassignment from the DMS due to an incident involving a Rammstein album and a longbow he calls &quot;psychological warfare&quot;, and the Flowers call &quot;unnecessary torture of a Sue&quot;. Thanks to his universe being originally from the UK, he has a pronounced British accent, though has never been there himself. <br><br>Agent Elly Ruskowski - A twenty-two year old from Aspen, Elly was a civilian watcher for several years before being given the opportunity to join the PPC, a choice she now regrets. She has a tendency to get very excited when meeting characters she admires, and very angry when they&#39;re messed with. This anger tends to come out in the form of extremely loud rants about an offender, their heritage, sexual preferences and threats, most of which she follows up on at the conclusion of a mission. Outside of missions in her favourite fandoms, she&#39;s usually either pretty calm, a state often helped by semi-legal, or very hyperactive if something takes her personal interest, and especially if Lothar hasn&#39;t seen or read something she thinks is important. </p>

            <p>It seems like you have something of a misapprehension of what PPC stories are about. Have you read the Original Series? If so, you may have noticed that they&#39;re not actually stories of people who are wantonly violent and prone to torture and spitting invective. Consider Acy&#39;s &#39;torture&#39; of a Suvian by placing burrs in her shoes, or Jay&#39;s working out her anger with the aid of Mister Socko and Millie.<br><br>The PPC isn&#39;t a universe of psychopaths. It&#39;s a setting of relatively ordinary people who are doing a thankless, infuriating, and endlessly rewarding job.<br><br>Please read around more until you don&#39;t think Chaos Space Marines are suitable agents. :)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Hi! I&#39;m Ffwydriad, and I used to be a member some four or more years ago. Recently, a rather random series of links through the backwaters of the internet led me back, and I&#39;m honestly overjoyed that the community is still around. Currently I&#39;m reading and rereading pretty much all of the mission fics I can find, but I felt it would be proper to introduce myself. <br><br>Hopefully I&#39;ll actually keep my attention span focused enough to stay around and actually start writing this time! </p>

            <p>Honestly my Sindarin is subpar, but I&#39;ve been proven to have masochistic tendencies when it comes to translation. <br><br>I am willing and likely unable to race you on that, but given that I&#39;ve got the next two days off I&#39;ll be willing to try. :)<br><br>As for the title - if I&#39;m right, there are Sindarin question words, Man being &quot;what&quot; or &quot;who&quot;, so perhaps &quot;Man  I Nestradren&quot; for &quot;Who is the Doctor&quot; instead? I&#39;m uncertain, the fact there&#39;s no is/are in Sindarin always throws me off.<br><br>That multiverse theory is wonderful by the way, as are the alternate Doctor Who versions.

            <p>Get your translate on, and we&#39;ll meet back here to compare on... Wednesday?<br><br>I&#39;m going to do <i>Unearthly Child</i>.

Or you can ignore it as a ridiculous idea. ;)<br><br>You&#39;re right about <i>man</i>; I didn&#39;t know about it, because I&#39;m using the Ardalambion Sindarin wordlist, and the Turin Wrapper which gives it was only published in 2013. Cool. :D So <u>Man I Nestadren</u> works, and has the added bonus that since since there&#39;s no &#39;to be&#39; verb, it can also mean &quot;Who, the Doctor&quot;. Double meanings are fun.<br><br>Anyway - see you in a couple of days.

            <p>I have been faced with the friendly reminder I am unable to do two things. One is write in Sindarin.

            <p>Because I have to start somewhere.<br><br><b>Barbara Wright</b>: Barbara comes from &#39;barbarian&#39;, wright obviously means someone who makes things.<br><br>hS&#39;s version: Uanuiel Tân. &#39;Uanuiel&#39; is a cludge from uanui+iel, &#39;monstrous woman&#39;. &#39;Tân&#39; is &#39;Maker&#39;, and forms the second syllable of Cirdan&#39;s name. (Both taken straight from the Ardalambion wordlist.)<br><br>Ffwydriad&#39;s version: Edel Thavron. &#39;Edel&#39; is purportedly Sindarin for &#39;stranger&#39;, but the source doesn&#39;t reference anything. <a href="https://www.elfdict.com/w/traveller">This source</a> gives &#39;Othol&#39; as the Sindarin for &#39;stranger&#39;, and references PE17. <a href="http://www.lotrplaza.com/archives/index.php?Archive=First%20Age&amp;TID=210124">This source</a> gives &#39;Ethelion&#39; as a translation of Peregrin (= wanderer), and I know Sindarin likes to alter the first vowel in words with endings, so &#39;Othol&#39; or &#39;Othel&#39; makes sense. A feminine name could be &#39;Etheliel&#39;, which might well contract to &#39;Ethiel&#39;.<br><br>&#39;Thavron&#39; does indeed mean wright, and I feel silly for not looking it up directly. [Facepalm]<br><br><u>Best version:</u> I&#39;m gonna go with Ffwydriad here and give <b>Ethiel Thavron</b> as the best translation.<br><br><b>Ian Chesterton</b>: Ian is the Scottish version of John, which comes from Hebrew &#39;Yochanan&#39;, meaning &#39;G*d is Gracious&#39;. Chesterton I&#39;m pretty sure goes back to Caster+Town, or &#39;Fort-Village&#39;.<br><br>hS&#39;s version: Eruan Garthobel. I glossed Ian as Eruan, &#39;Gift of God&#39;, which... is wrong. [Facepalm] I&#39;m on firmer ground with the surname Garthobel, which means Stronghold Enclosed-Dwelling - pretty much exactly the meaning in the original.<br><br>Ffwydriad&#39;s version: Eruainon Echadion. Eru we know. &#39;ainon&#39;... the best I can do is this being Quenya for &#39;son of holiness&#39;. The namelist gives &#39;Erufael&#39;, &#39;God is just&#39;, while the Parf Edhellen site gives &#39;raen&#39; for &#39;sweet-faced&#39; as its best approximation for &#39;gracious&#39; (also from PE17). That would give &#39;Eruraen&#39;, which hurts to say. Maybe that&#39;s the source of Eruainon, with the R vanishing...<br><br>Echadion... hmm. &#39;Echad&#39; for camp is sourced to Unfinished Tales, where it&#39;s part of a placename (Echad i Sedryn, Camp of the Faithful). Valid (I&#39;m now irritated that Ardalambion doesn&#39;t give it; I may have to transfer alliegence to the Parf Edhellen.) Then you&#39;ve got a &#39;son of&#39; on the end, which isn&#39;t what the name means.<br><br><u>Best version</u>: I think I have to go with the namelist + the accurate translation, and pick <b>Erufael Garthobel</b> here. Bonus points for the Doctor being able to call him &#39;Parthobel&#39; and have it still be a word.<br><br><b>Susan Foreman:</b> Susan means lily, by way of a Hebrew word which now means &#39;rose&#39; as well, and an Egyptian one meaning &#39;lotus&#39;. A foreman is a sort of practical manager: they stand between the people doing the actual work, and the management above.<br><br>hS&#39;s version: Elloth Taid. &#39;Elloth&#39; is just &#39;flower&#39;, though it feels like it could mean &#39;star-blossom&#39; - which describes a lily very nicely. We might actually want to go over to &#39;Meril&#39; here, which literally means &#39;rose&#39;. Taid is a word meaning second-in-command.<br><br>Ffwydriad&#39;s version: Elloth Hîrbenn. Elloth we know. Hîrbenn is a construct, Hîr+benn, &#39;lord-man&#39;. &#39;benn&#39; is actually an archaic word for husband, which has slipped over to just meaning man. In constructs it should actually show up as either &#39;ben&#39; or &#39;ven&#39;, which suggests to me that we should avoid it. Instead, we can use the archaic word dîr, which shows up in names as -nir or -dir.<br><br>Of course, we can&#39;t exactly use &#39;Hirdir&#39;, so now we need another word for a mid-level leader. Hmm... how about taid? :D Taidnir works perfectly well as a spoken name, though I admit it looks a bit clunky. Failing that, &#39;Herdir&#39; is a genuine Sindarin word for &#39;master&#39;, as used to mean &#39;Mister&#39;. And the idea of the Doctor&#39;s junkyard being named &#39;Some Bloke&#39;s Yard&#39; tickles me.<br><br><b>Best version:</b> I just can&#39;t forsake the star-flower. <b>Elloth Herdir</b> it is.<br><br>hS<br><br>(PS: inb4 &#39;Susan is the Master!&#39;. Oops...)</p>

<li>&quot;Yochanan&quot; has nothing to do with grace. &quot;Yo&quot; is indeed related to God (יו tends to stand for a part of the tetragrammaton), but חנן actually means &quot;has given a good attribute&quot;, so the name literally means &quot;God has given this person a good attribute&quot;.<br><br>2.

            <p>First off, I&#39;m very impressed that you got so much of it done! I find Sindarin an awful grind, so well done.<br><br>On the formatting: I actually didn&#39;t bother with columns. My version is a carefully-hidden table, with cell breaks to keep things lined up. It sends the whole thing wildly over to the left, but keeps it organised.<br><br>On lentition: I had to put myself together a little checklist of when it&#39;s needed, which I left in place at the bottom of my script. Feel free to crib it.<br><br>Rather than start... well, technically it&#39;s betaing, isn&#39;t it? Rather than start betaing your script, I&#39;d like to ask where your vocabulary and grammar comes from. My preferred source is <a href="http://folk.uib.no/hnohf/">Ardalambion</a>, but I can see you&#39;re using words that don&#39;t show up there (&#39;Edel&#39; for stranger, for instance). You also <i>didn&#39;t</i> use the common fanfic term &#39;daeradar&#39; for &#39;grandfather&#39;, so it doesn&#39;t look like you&#39;re working from a fanficcy dictionary. What are your sources?<br><br>(Ardalambion Sindarin wordlist and grammar is based on David Salo&#39;s work, and is fairly comprehensive. I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s <i>right</i>, so if you have a different source I&#39;m definitely curious.)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I&#39;m impressed I got that much done as well, and that&#39;s a smarter move on formatting. I forget what docs can do.<br><br>My wordlist was <a href="https://www.jrrvf.com/hisweloke/sindar/online/sindar/dict-sd-en.html">Hiswelókë&#39;s</a> Sindarin-English dictionary, with some additional use of <a href="http://elfdict.com">this</a> word look up, which is why there&#39;s one or two Quenya words (mainly Totter lane) worked to fit in Sindarin standard.<br><br>My grammar was <a href="http://www.elvish.org/gwaith/sindarin_grammar.htm">here</a> along with some spare online lessons I went through a  while back. <br><br>Edel comes from <a href="http://arwen-undomiel.com">Arwen-Undomiel</a> from their list of translated names. I also used some of their simple phrases as well.<br><br>I actually thought about using some form of &#39;grand&#39; and &#39;father&#39; but it seemed kind of awkward for me. I also thought about changing the Quenya word for grandfather to  Sindarin, but I don&#39;t actually know how to go about that. If daeradar is common though, I&#39;ll probably end up using that when I eventually go back through, finish the episode.</p>

            <p>Oh! Yes! Fandoms are a thing that I have! The biggest for me is Marvel, mainly the comics but also the cartoons and movies. Lord of the Rings, Doctor Who, Star Trek, Voltron, Homestuck, A Series of Unfortunate Events, Discworld, The X-Files, Miraculous Ladybug, and a large selection of Anime and Manga as well. </p>

            <p>This is <i>so</i> weird. I was completely obsessed with the series for much of my preadolescent life (I think I still have my terrible nine-year old fan art). And now I&#39;m slowly but surely learning that <i>this is an actual fandom</i>, which can be listed alongside typically nerdy things like Discworld* and Star Trek**. I am utterly stupefied, a word which here means &quot;startled and feeling an equal mix of excitement to find people who enjoy the same things I do and fear that my childhood will be forever ruined by badly-written porn starring Count Olaf.&quot; <br><br>Or do you just mean the Netflix adaptation? Or the movie <s>*shudders*</s>?<br><br>--Key<br><br>*Has been top of my to-read list for years.<br>**Watching in chronological order. On season three of TOS and <s>suffering</s> going strong!</p>

            <p>I have become a minor Kamen Rider fan. It&#39;s only been through two series, though: so far, I&#39;ve seen the entirety of Ryuki, and I&#39;m currently at episode 40 of Kuuga. I actually have not seen Gaim (which I know is what the Lockseed refers to), but the only other series I&#39;ve watched anything of is Kabuto. My reaction to that? &quot;SHUT UP, TENDOU!&quot;<br><br>Anyway, thanks!</p>
