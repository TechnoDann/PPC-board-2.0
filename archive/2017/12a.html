            <p>Ok, I am a day late posting this, but I am going ahead anyways. So, December has begun and I am here to here to announce the beginning of another monthly challenge called Character Drawcember. Yes, this is an art challenge not writing challenge; and PPC is a writing community. However, I think writers benefit from this particular challenge as well, especially in terms of characterization. I&#39;m probably going to do this over two months because exams.<br><br>The rules are pretty simple, there are basically no rules. You can use whatever medium, whatever style, whatever characters you want (you could use your agents or even the results from that superhero round robin we did).<br><br>Here is the link for the prompts:<br><a href="http://laurenwallaceart.tumblr.com/post/103949352875/introducing-character-drawcember-this-is-a"></a><a href="http://laurenwallaceart.tumblr.com/post/103949352875/introducing-character-drawcember-this-is-a"><a href="http://laurenwallaceart.tumblr.com/post/103949352875/introducing-character-drawcember-this-is-a">http://laurenwallaceart.tumblr.com/post/103949352875/introducing-character-drawcember-this-is-a</a></a><br><br>I highly encourage you guys to try this out, especially if you are in the middle of creating some characters. You don&#39;t have to be a good artist to do this; art is art regardless of technical skill, I&#39;m not a good artist myself. You don&#39;t even have to finish it on time, I&#39;m probably going to do this over two months.<br></p>

            <p>I did the third prompt first, because... well, I felt like it. Anyways, here is my redesigned character. He isn&#39;t old per se, in fact, he is actually pretty new; he did go through a lot of changes though, which is why i chose him.<br><br><a href="https://imgur.com/M6tIZkq"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/M6tIZkq.png" width="420" height="595" title="source: imgur.com"></a><br><br>Ah, my little brother, where to begin. He&#39;s pretty smart, and strong too, I can always rely on him to back me up. He can be a bit demanding at times, but I allow him his bratty moments. <br>-Shinonome Azusa<br><br>Kaede is great, I really admire him. He is really smart, and could always think of something to get us out of a bad situation. Although, there was that one time we were hopelessly outclassed. I just wish he would be less hard on Azusa for making rash decisions.<br>-Shinonome Tsubaki</p>

            <p>I really like the flare effect on his magic eye; it&#39;s nicely done.<br><br>I think the cloak would probably cast shadows on his skin?

            <p>What mad alternate universe is this?<br><br>(As you will see when I get my #4 up in a few minutes, this is rampant hypocrisy.)<br><br>I think the differentiation of the beds is a nice marker of personality, but... where&#39;s all their stuff? Having <i>nothing</i> makes it look like you forgot it exists, whereas having only a <i>few</i> things - a lamp, a mug, essentials of that kind - looks like a deliberate choice. You could also use that to distinguish the two bed-sides a little more - you just <i>know</i> that the one on the left has glasses of water from the last three nights left on the table in various states of fullness.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Other than that, it looks pretty good as far as lines and angles go. I can tell you didn&#39;t use a straightedge the whole time, but it&#39;s only really obvious on the left-hand table and the books.<br><br>With all that wall space, though, it&#39;s very apparent that there&#39;s nothing on any of them. I guess there wouldn&#39;t be if it&#39;s a barrack, but there would if it&#39;s a dorm. Posters, weapon displays, mirrors, lights, sheets, whatever else people hang on their walls... anything to show the personalities of the people who live there. And your characters clearly have personality to display. {= )<br><br>(I&#39;m dreading this prompt.

            <p>Here is my protagonist. I know she is not wearing very much, there is a reason for it other than &quot;it&#39;s sexy&quot; and has to do with how a certain type of magic works in universe. I&#39;ll be happy to explain if anyone asks (long story). Coincidentally, it is the same reason as to why Kaede and Yue aren&#39;t wearing much either.<br><br><a href="https://imgur.com/t618TZ4"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/t618TZ4.png" width="420" height="595" title="source: imgur.com"></a><br><br>She&#39;s strong, crazy strong. There is no one else I would rather fight beside. Unfortunately, she&#39;s impulsive; if there is something no one is stupid enough to do, Azusa is going to do it.<br>-Shinonome Kaede<br><br>She is always so cheerful and energetic, even on bad days. It seems like life is just one big party when she is around, if there is something interesting happening near by, she is definitely going to charge head first into whatever is going on. Maybe she should try and be more careful so she doesn&#39;t get in trouble as often as she does.<br>-Shinonome Tsuaki</p>

            <p>He&#39;s, um... <sub>he&#39;s missing something...</sub> ^_~<br><br>Once again, I have to complement the facial expression here. Yue looks super excited to be in this fight; I&#39;d imagine it&#39;s a training bout, possibly from before he turned against the Shinonomes. And the way his eyes stand out from the rest of his face really draws attention to them.<br><br>I think there&#39;s something subtly off about his proportions, though: it looks like his head is to scale with his arms, but his body and legs are a bit too large for them. Might be worth taking a look at.<br><br>I really have to comment on those trousers, though - the rumpling is very nicely done. Not <i>over</i>done, but clearly and cleanly evoking exactly what you wanted. Nice.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>[Checks] Well, it still says PPC Board, so I assume yes... :D<br><br>I&#39;m going to start by saying I really like the expression on Kaede&#39;s (I assume his full name is Shinonome Kaede, but &#39;little brother&#39; could be an idiom I guess) face; I know it&#39;s pretty simple, but he really looks like he&#39;s intensely focussed. The whole image looks like he&#39;s doing something like telekinetically lifting a heavy object - it&#39;s hard, but he&#39;s not letting it beat him.<br><br>The eye is most definitely drawn to his face and hand, but I feel like his hands are slightly out of proportion. I think the thumbs are too short? I&#39;m personally appalling at hands, but that doesn&#39;t mean I can&#39;t comment on them. ^_^<br><br>I&#39;m also going to highlight your shading here; as another thing I&#39;m trying to learn, I&#39;m impressed in particular by the legs.

            <p>Here&#39;s a protagonist (Derik) and an unused character, redesigned (his dragon). Except the dragon was never really mine, and is more, er, deceased than unused. So, cheating.

Nor do I know what Derik is sitting on. Maybe a rock or a log or something, I dunno. I think he&#39;s gonna stay topless, though, because a) it&#39;s fun, and b) his revised backstory has him serving somewhere in the Southern Continent, maybe Eastern Weyr, so it&#39;s hot.<br><br>Despite using Gerard Butler as a reference, there is still some ephemeral Gerard Butler-ness I seem unable to capture. Argh. Also, I may have gone too far with the near shoulder, but he is supposed to be kinda huge in the shoulders, so I dunno. What do you think?<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I&#39;m gonna start by saying that I love the detail on the heads - all three of them, counting that beautiful harp [/Dafydd]. Skepnadth looks completely relaxed, just gazing at Derik, while Derik looks both focussed and faintly amused. And harp!dragon is just super proud to be here, guys - it&#39;s her big break, so she&#39;s giving it all she&#39;s got! [/Dafydd... again]<br><br>I don&#39;t think Derik&#39;s shoulder flags up as wrong (though I note that <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=312467;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board"></a>he, too, is missing something ^_~), but I can&#39;t follow the line of Skepnadth&#39;s neck for love nor Marks. I think he&#39;s got a 90-degree bend in it? There&#39;s definitely <i>something</i> weird going on with him spine.<br><br>(I&#39;m also being thrown off by the lack of him body. It ought to be curving waaaaay up as it heads to the right, but as it is that sweeping curve looks like a back leg, making him the most truncated dragon ever.)<br><br>(Also, confession: at this point I realised I had consistently referred to Skepnadth as &#39;she&#39;. :O I apologise profusely, and have no idea why that happened.)<br><br>I like this picture. I hope you get it finished, because I think it&#39;ll be really good. And I really <i>do</i> like that harp. [/Dafydd... nah, it&#39;s just me, really]<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I think, unfortunately, it&#39;s because of the pose - the way her arms are now, she looks more like she&#39;s going &#39;ta-da!&#39;, or possibly dancing. That mace is <i>heavy</i> - it should be drawing her arm after it as it swings.<br><br>Moving onto the rest: that <i>hair</i>! O.O I love it. I can see exactly what you&#39;re visualising, and it works really well.<br><br>You&#39;ve fixed the armour problem, and I think you&#39;ve conveyed the muscles really well; that single line on her shoulder (plus the shape <i>of</i> the shoulder) works excellently. (Though... she is pulling a Female Comic Character pose, with that near-ninety-degree twist of her hips...)<br><br>With that said, I have to wonder what&#39;s going on with her forearms. I assume it&#39;s meant to be armour, but - particularly on the one holding the mace - it&#39;s pretty much a cylinder. I think you&#39;ve got the 3-Ding of the rear hand off, too - the armour is tilted away, so we shouldn&#39;t see it coming up around her wrist like that.<br><br>All in all, a big improvement from where I&#39;m sitting. I do miss the skirt, though... (and Derik grabbing the &#39;neck&#39; of her armour has just gotten, uh... exceptionally suggestive. ^_~)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Maybe I&#39;ll make the mace-head smaller, and tighten her grip a bit. That might help fix the problem without me having to redo the whole arm again.<br><br>I disagree about the Female Comic Character Pose. I see why it looks wrong, but I&#39;m pretty sure it&#39;ll make sense once it&#39;s all colored. She&#39;s small-chested, like most really buff women, the breastplate curves around to the side a fair bit, and there&#39;s really only a little side-butt showing. Most of what you see there is leg, rotated forward. Maybe there&#39;s not quite enough hip on the far side, though?<br><br>Glad you like the hair, and the muscles!

            <p>... I don&#39;t spend <i>that</i> much time looking at women in scanty body-armour, so my reading is entirely possible to be off. ;) As usual with my comments, don&#39;t read my confident tone as indicating that I actually know what I&#39;m talking about!<br><br>I think part of the issue with the mace is that it seems to be coming off at an (upwards) angle to her arm; I feel like the only way that could happen is if she&#39;s deliberately holding it that way.

If Gall had her arm slightly bent, or her arm at a slight up/down angle (which people generally do - holding your arm straight out horizontally feels very unnatural, though I guess less so when you&#39;re swinging a heavy object), you&#39;d be able to see part of it and avoid the &#39;maceborg&#39; look. (The way the shading on the side of the mace joins with the armour to look like scar tissue doesn&#39;t help... ;))<br><br>Apart from that, I was immediately drawn to the hair and the (visible) hand. I know the hair is only roughly sketched in - you can see the shape of her skull under it - but if you ignore that construction line, I think it looks very good. It speaks to her character, and actually looks curly. (Is that a braid behind her ear? It kind of looks like one; I might need to crib that sometime.)<br><br>As to her hand, it&#39;s good! I think the shading might be <i>slightly</i> off - it looks like she&#39;s got a substantial pad on the non-thumb side, which I don&#39;t think is right? - but that&#39;s nitpicky; just looking at it, it&#39;d good.<br><br>I feel like there&#39;s something going on with her armour, which I think comes from treating it like cloth. You&#39;ve got it near enough in the plane of the page at the shoulders, but skewed round with her hips further down; a solid plate (metal or leather) wouldn&#39;t do that. It would... I guess it would ride up on the back shoulder? Not sure.<br><br>In contrast, the skirt works very well, and (though they&#39;re only loosely sketched) her legs also worked out. They look leg-shaped, and capture the dynamism of her movement.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Yeah, I&#39;m gonna have to do something about the leading arm. I think it might be better if there were any way to know how big the mace-head is supposed to be, but there isn&#39;t. For all anyone looking knows, it really is the size of her actual head.<br><br>I&#39;m probably gonna change the armor completely. I just threw on a Generic Breastplate to have something there and a leather skirt so it didn&#39;t look like there was nothing between the breastplate and her legs. &gt;.&gt; She has thigh plates, too (which I&#39;m sure have an actual name I&#39;m not recalling right now), but you can&#39;t really tell anymore. Anyway, in the RP where this actually happened, she&#39;s dressed up as Hawkgirl a la <i>Justice League</i>, and I think I&#39;m gonna use that. Though I was surprised to be reminded how little that breastplate actually covers. Derik grabbed the edge of the plate at the neck at one point, but there <i>is</i> no neck. Just cleavage. *facepalm*<br><br>The hair is supposed to be braided, yes! I&#39;ve yet to decide exactly how, but it&#39;s good to know the back part works for that. ^_^<br><br>Thanks!<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

If I can figure out where the shading goes (and fix that crossbow!), I probably <i>will</i> colour it - her outfit is entirely white, so it&#39;s just her face and arms. (She&#39;s wearing white silk stockings, because style is one thing, and cold legs are quite another thank you very much.)<br><br>I think this is the official halfway point, or near enough.

            <p>The pose looks well done, and the crossbow is actually pretty decent, if a bit plain. Remember, all you really have to do is suggest to the viewer and not include every single detail, and you have certainly suggested the orientation of the crossbow decently. However, on closer inspection it looks like her crossbow is aimed straight back and out of angle with her arm.<br><br>A bit of a concern is her hair, you drew a border then added streaks to it to simulate hair. This turns the hair into a block. Hair, especially the tips, don&#39;t really have a defined edge in realistic art, so a suggestion here is to just border the sides of the mass of hair, but leave the tips open. Then use a really fine pencil and make strokes.</p>

            <p>I don&#39;t know what to tell you about the scanner, unfortunately. It should just, y&#39;know, do its job. Check your settings, I guess? Make sure you&#39;re scanning a photo/image, not a document or something? And closing the lid is important, I think?<br><br>As for coloring plus shading, that&#39;s gonna be a no. Adding color over graphite is just going to give you greyed-out colors, especially on lighter tones like skin.<br><br>When you get into colors, shadows often tend to actually be slightly blue or purple (though it depends on the color of the light source and blah blah, not really important right now). You can also tone down or deepen any color you&#39;re using by adding something from the other side of the color wheel. For instance, I used Tuscan red for the darkest shadows on Gall&#39;s leggings (dark green brightened with grass green, white highlights). I used the same combination to create the near-black portions of her cuirass and gauntlets, plus indigo where I wanted it darkest. On her skin, the darker shades are henna and a slightly greenish sandbar brown. Again, I used indigo for the very deepest shadows. Only a very little black to bring out the outlines that were muted.<br><br>Using opposite colors like this is a thing I&#39;ve only just started doing (<a href="https://neshomeh.deviantart.com/art/Island-354759752">this</a> was an early experiment in using blue shadows to make the light seem more yellow), but I have to say it works!<br><br>... And I realize it&#39;s all more or less Greek to you. But you did ask.<br><br>For reference, I&#39;m using Prismacolor pencils; the names may or may not translate to other brands.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Definitely reflects the caption. {= )<br><br>On the shadows, acknowledging that this might be due to a bad scan, it looks like you went too far on the face and not far enough on the robe. Partly because the the shadow across her nose and cheek has a mottled texture, it kinda looks like a bruise. I think the others would work if I weren&#39;t distracted by that one, though. It would also help if the skin tone were more saturated to begin with. I tend to use at least three tones for skin: First, a base layer, usually light peach for a fair complexion or beige for a sallow one. Everything gets layered over and blended back into it. Second, a pink or near-red for areas of high vascularity, like the cheeks; and third, a browner shade for less vascular areas. Plus whatever looks right for lip color, pockets under the eyes, etc. For Gall, the base tone was Deco peach, the pink was blush pink (this is very aptly named and I use it a lot), and her &quot;brown&quot; was light peach, because she is very fair. Plus the henna, sandbar brown, and teensiest bit of indigo for shadows, and white for highlights.<br><br>Skin is complicated. Hair is, too, and I use more or less the same process to do that: soft base coat of the lightest highlight color, mid-tone, dark tone. (Except for black hair. I&#39;m working on how to make black hair less flat.) Definitely get good pencils if you want to keep going with this.<br><br>A good point: her right sleeve looks pretty good! The shape of the shadow brings out the roundness of the cuff, and it all looks cohesive.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

This is <a href="http://twistedskein.webs.com/EndJourney.htm">the contract with Mandos</a> that renders Constance functionally immortal in Middle-earth. The precise text is an Easter egg in its own right, too...<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I think it took a good 3 hours scattered throughout the day, perhaps more. As to how I /found/ the time... luckily the children were happy to entertain themselves a fair bit (with the careful addition of a few new toys).<br><br>I started with the furniture, constructing all the lines in light pencil before going over them im dark. Then it was just a matter of looking at the spaces and deciding what should go in there. (The last thing I did was adjust the bedcovers to try and get them to look better. The second to last was removing high-level shelves above the ones I left, so as not to have to put anything on them... :D)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>First: Yay blending. ^_^ Don&#39;t be afraid to go for really dark darks, though. (I say this as someone who has struggled with this fear for years.)<br><br>Next: I think these are some of the best eyes you&#39;ve done so far, which is because you&#39;re getting away from the flat footballish shape that pretty much everyone starts off doing. Eyeballs are spheres set inside holes in the head. Eyelids curve around those spheres with the corners set more deeply in the face than the fronts, and the degree of visible curve varies with how open the eye is, the tilt of the head, heaviness of the lids and surrounding tissue, and all sorts of stuff. Eyes are complex little things!<br><br>Same goes for the mouth, kinda. The right (her left) corner of the mouth looks pretty good here, because the shading on that side of the face shows the depth where the corner sinks back into the cheek. The other corner looks more flat by contrast.<br><br>... I didn&#39;t know I was all full of advice like this. &gt;.&gt;<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Definitely an improvement. There&#39;s a dark dot on her stomach that keeps distracting me by looking like a very misplaced belly-button, but I don&#39;t think that was intentional?<br><br>Next step: invest in a blending stump or two. These are basically tightly rolled sticks of paper that let you smear the graphite into smooth gradients. In the meantime, though, a bit of tissue on the end of your finger works, too. {= )<br><br>I think Remnant covered the hands well enough, so I&#39;ll mention that the jaw looks a bit misaligned. It might be the way the neck connects with a straight line to the hinge just at the junction of the ear on the left. It shouldn&#39;t quite do that; there&#39;s a muscle that runs from the pit of the collarbones up behind the ear (the sternocleidomastoid) that should carry that neck line back a little. You kinda have that shaded in at the throat, but it looks like it goes straight up to her chin rather than back.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>The hands actually look decent enough. However, on closer inspection, it does look like the fingers are directly connected to the wrist. Also the fingers look like there are no bones. A good way to fix this is to draw the structure of the hand before actually drawing the hand. This applies for the body as well if you draw it free hand. Everything can be broken down into component shapes, so you first construct the hands from their components, which are the palm, the fingers, and the thumb. The fingers and thumb can be further broken down into a series of cylinders, and the palm can be represented as a trapezoid or pentagon. To construct the hand simply place the components in the correct orientation and position, foreshorten if necessary. Then outline. I just realized I sound like Lego instructions.<br><br>The body looks well shaded and the shadows are correctly oriented for the most part. Everything else seems fine, though the lineart can use some cleaning up. The facial expression looks pretty good.<br><br>(As you can see, I&#39;m not really good at concrit.)</p>

            <p>Yeah, I have trouble with noses when they&#39;re tipped up. I also have trouble with shading in general, which... hey, you seem to know about this sort of thing, can you help?<br><br>My problem is that I can&#39;t get properly &#39;light&#39; shading to work. You can see I&#39;ve tried to get the shadows running down the front of Connie&#39;s cheeks here, but every time I try, they end up looking like old-person wrinkles. Same for the shadow under her lower lip (though in this case I think it kind of works, because of how weird her mouth is being).<br><br>I actually have a set of pencils of different hardness, and my assumption has been that softer pencils are intended for shading, but they seem to lay down darker lines the softer they are. Should I be using one of them for the main lines, and the harder pencils for shading? (Or, I guess, should I be using soft pencils for shading and then inking the hard lines to darken them?)<br><br>I&#39;m not even going to get started on colour, though I probably will be redoing and colouring this one unless Prompt #3 turns out really well.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I&#39;m no expert, but...<br><br>First, &quot;hardness&quot; refers to the actual consistency of the lead, so the softer the lead, the more easily you can transfer lots of graphite onto the page. Softer pencils are for darker lines, harder for lighter lines. You want to use a somewhat hard pencil for light sketching/shading, then the rest for varying depth of shadow.<br><br>(Personally, I just use a regular old .5 mm HB mechanical pencil for everything, but I <i>have</i> drawing pencils...)<br><br>As for shading—again, not an expert, so take this with a grain of salt—but shadows are basically for one of two things: 1) where the light is blocked, and 2) where the contours of the shape recede from the light source and/or the eye of the viewer. Highlights are the opposite.<br><br>If you&#39;re going to finish a drawing in graphite, you&#39;ll want to pick your white point and your black point. The white point is the brightest/nearest thing, the black point is the darkest/furthest thing. On a face, the shine of the eye is likely to be the brightest spot, and the pupils and nostrils are probably going to be the darkest. Note these points are not necessarily literally white and black. They&#39;re just the brightest and the darkest shade you intend to use. Everything else is somewhere in between. It&#39;s all relative, depending on the brightness and directness of your hypothetical light source as much as the actual lightness values of the subject.<br><br>Also bear in mind that the human brain is phenomenal at filling in details it expects to be there. You don&#39;t have to show every line on the face unless you&#39;re going for super-detailed true-to-life portraiture. Art relies on memes and signifiers the same way writing does, and lines on a face signify age. You do have the faintest shadow of that nose-mouth line there, and I think that&#39;s fine for the amount of detail you&#39;ve got.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

The part I&#39;m least satisfied with is the water, to be honest - except for the submerged parts, she looks like she&#39;s lying on a duvet!<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Iximaz was kind enough to remind me that yes, it is in fact December already, and that means it&#39;s time for the PPC Holiday Filk Game!<br><br>As usual, the following guidelines apply:<br><br>1. Pick a seasonal tune that strikes your fancy—anything you like, even if it&#39;s been used for this before.<br>2. Write new words for it with a PPC theme.<br>    2a. I encourage you to seek for a topic that does not involve Sue-slaying, because we have lots of filks about that. If that&#39;s what the muse dictates, though, go for it.<br>    2b. What I&#39;d really like to see are more tunes about actual holiday stuff in Headquarters. There are lots of holiday filks about PPC stuff, but not too many holiday filks about PPC <i>holiday</i> stuff. Odd, ne?<br>3. Post your filk here in this thread for us to enjoy and comment on.<br>4. If so inclined, share a recording of yourself singing a filk or two.<br>5. When all&#39;s said, sung, and done, I&#39;ll add this year&#39;s entries to the <a href="http://starshadowhall.tripod.com/ppc/songbook/">PPC Holiday Songbook</a> unless you specify otherwise.<br><br>As usual, I have yet to add last year&#39;s entries, but I shall do so forthwith. Meanwhile, have fun!<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve got a filk for you!<br><br>I call it...Eight Nights in the PPC (Chanukah, Chanukah). There&#39;s probably a better title out there, but that&#39;s what I&#39;ve got.<br><br>I really like this one. I even made <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1UA_BLJN6SYJxG0Mw3OtS_rW2gllpRQof">a recording!</a> (It includes the original, one-verse song at the end, because why not?) (Also: this was <i>so much fun</i> to record, and I love how it came out. Yes there&#39;s a sort of semi-key change at the end. Yes, it&#39;s more or less on purpose. Yes, it could have been done a little better. No, I don&#39;t care; it was <i>fun</i>)<br><br>Lyrics:<br><br>Come one, come all, PPC, it&#39;s time for Chanukah<br>First we&#39;ll bless, then we&#39;ll light, then we&#39;ll eat latkas<br>Oh no, there goes the console, oy, vey is mir, why, why<br>Curse th&#39;SO, fine, we&#39;ll go off to see canons cry!<br><br>Second night, this one&#39;s right, joy is everywhere<br>Bless, now light, get it right, two candles for the prayer<br>Dreidels first, then the food, but there goes that BEEEP!<br>How&#39;s this right?! Oh, well, we&#39;ll fight--we&#39;ll be here all week!<br><br>Third night&#39;s here, full of cheer, light those candles quick<br>If you still light olive oil, don&#39;t forget the wick<br>No you can&#39;t make it from Sue&#39;s hair what is wrong with you<br>Burns too fast, this should last, and leave no glitter too<br><br>Fourth night comes, halfway done, missions won&#39;t you stop<br>This has to be against some rule--come on, it&#39;s a chag!!<br>This holiday is meant to be the festival of lights:<br>DOGA jobs don&#39;t count for that! Don&#39;t we have some rights?<br><br>Tonight&#39;s the fifth, we won&#39;t quit, we talked to Upstairs<br>That frustrated us so we nearly pulled out hairs<br>It&#39;s a shame we can&#39;t sue, but is it much to ask?<br>Give us a modern miracle--an evening with no tasks!<br><br>Sixth night comes, we&#39;ll have some fun, just--no one sit down<br>Comfort makes the console beep, and we&#39;re tired of running &#39;round<br>Chanukah, here we go, chocolate coins galore<br>Gifts for kids--oh no, don&#39;t sit--we can&#39;t take any more! <br><br>Seventh night shines so bright. What did we do this year?<br>Barely months since Yom Kippur, how is this happening?<br>Yes, we know, the rhyme is gone, but we are falling over<br>Between missions and holiday things--at least it&#39;s almost done!<br><br>[Pause/musical interlude]<br><br>...Eighth night. We can&#39;t believe our eyes--finally...it&#39;s calm<br>So much love, all this light, sufgan&#39;yot almost gone<br>Gather &#39;round, sing those songs, hug your family<br>Give out gifts, dance a bit and retell that story!<br><br>[go off dancing to the singing of &quot;Chanukah, Chanukah&quot;:<br><br>Chanukah, Chanukah, chag yafe kol kach<br>Or chaviv misaviv, gil le&#39;yeled rach<br>Chanukah, Chanukah, sevivon sov sov<br>Sov na sov, sov na sov, ma na&#39;im va&#39;tov!<br><br><br>(Translation, <a href="http://www.aish.com/h/c/mm/s/48970856.html">from aish.com</a>:<br><br>Chanukah is a great holiday.<br>Surrounded with lovely light.<br>Fun for little children.<br>Dreidel, spin, spin, spin.<br>How wonderful!]<br><br><br>Some Hebrew (mostly) translations:<br><br>latkas: potato pancakes. Delicious.<br>oy, vey is mir: Yiddish for &#39;oh woe is me&#39;. Much more common than &#39;woe is me&#39; these days, though. Very often shortened to just &#39;oy&#39; or &#39;oy vey&#39;<br>dreidel: a spinning top unique to Chanukah<br>chag: holiday<br>Yom Kippur: Day of Atonement, where the sins of the previous year are forgiven. Happens around October, hence the lament of &#39;what could we have already done to deserve this?!&#39;<br>sufganiot: jelly donuts. Delicious. Not always jelly these days, which is an <i>amazing</i> development<br><br><br>Another fun thing: each verse more or less corresponds to a different PPC department! It&#39;s not perfect, since it wasn&#39;t really done on purpose (shh), but for your potential amusement, here:<br><br>Verse 1: Department of Angst<br>Verse 2: DMS/ESAS<br>Verse 3: ...DoSAT?<br>Verse 4: DOGA, obviously<br>Verse 5: Building Maintenance? Yes, I&#39;m stretching<br>Verse 6: Any field agents<br>Verse 7: Also field agents. Oh well<br>Verse 8: Everyone<br><br><br>I have one more idea so far for a filk, but it hasn&#39;t happened yet. We&#39;ll see if it does. This one made for a fun morning bus ride, anyway!<br><br>Also, uh...Chanukah starts <i>Tuesday night</i>. What.<br><br>~Z</p>

            <p>Which I find hypocritical, given that he wrote Dark!Edgy!AU fanfic of Tolkien (to the point of nicking his R.R.) and medieval history, and that his personal style makes him look like the child of an Mpreg fic shipping Walt Whitman and Captain Haddock from Tintin. Let us also not forget Anne Rice, who has herself written what amounts to pornographic BDSM fanfiction of Beauty and the Beast under the name A.N. Roquelaire <i>and published it</i>. The missus has them. =]<br><br>I also don&#39;t agree that a given author can dictate the content of their fans&#39; works, only that they do not monetize them. As an author, ngl, you should not be reading your fans&#39; fic anyway because that way lies madness and potential lawsuits. Since you&#39;re not involved with it, and since you&#39;re not reading it, what harm does it do you that people make your characters do the horizontal lambada with aplomb and a worrying amount of latex hosiery?<br><br>It all brings to mind a quote about Ray Bradbury. In an interview, he was asked what he felt about Hollywood always adapting his books into absolutely atrocious movies and thus ruining them. Bradbury got up, walked over to a shelf full of his novels, and spread his arms wide.<br><br>&quot;Look at them,&quot; he said. &quot;They&#39;re all here. They&#39;re <i>fine</i>.&quot;</p>

            <p>I think trying to forbid fanworks altogether is an exercise in futility, even when it&#39;s not an outright insult to one&#39;s fanbase. I&#39;m also on the fence about how I feel about how much time it takes for things to pass into public domain. On the one hand, I&#39;m okay with it still being illegal for anyone to do whatever they want with Middle-earth, because I, as a fan, am already fed up with the <i>legal</i> stuff. On the other hand, dead authors can&#39;t collect royalties, and I think art should belong to the people.<br><br>That said, looking at it on a smaller scale, if I, a living PPC author, were to say &quot;Hey, I know you guys really like my agents, and I&#39;m cool with people using them in the Badfic Game, but please don&#39;t write them in non-con scenarios, it&#39;s not what I or my work stand for,&quot; would that be petty of me? I don&#39;t think so. I wouldn&#39;t read the stuff if people wrote it anyway, but I think it would be fair to ask people who purport to be fans of me and my work to respect my wishes regarding said work, and fair to be upset if they didn&#39;t.<br><br>It&#39;s not about somehow damaging the original IP, legally (though that can be a real concern) or otherwise. It&#39;s about respecting the IP&#39;s creator. That&#39;s why we don&#39;t do missions in canons whose authors don&#39;t want fanfic of their works, even if we disagree with their reasons.<br><br>(And yeah, GRRM is absolutely a Tolkien fanboy, which is really weird. I don&#39;t think ASoIaF is derivative enough to qualify as a Middle-earth AU, though. As hS points out in his hS way, all stories are built on other stories. Homage is allowed.)<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>My (current) thoughts on the appropriate length of the copyright term are &quot;14 years and 14 more if you ask&quot;<a href="http://localhost:3000/posts/scrape/2017/and%20I'm%20on%20the%20fence%20about%20dropping%20the%20%22life%20of%20the%20author%22%20clause">1</a>. Term starts at some sort of publication in this scheme.<br><br>The main reason for this is that, from what I can tell,  25-28ish (some subtleties of when you start counting from might eat a few years of the term for films and the like) years from when you&#39;ve published something either:<br><br>a) It&#39;s sufficiently popular/enduring/... so as to have become part of the culture (LotR very much falls here) and therefore it should be available to the whole culture to interact with free of fear of lawsuit<br><br>b) It&#39;s effectively run its course as a thing you can sell, is probably out of print or equivalent), and the only people who still are interested are archivists and the twenty remaining fans (this is somewhat exaggerated but you get the point). In this case, the remaining audience should have the right to preserve and propagate the thing since it&#39;s (near-)abandoned by the copyright holder.<br><br>c) Sleeping hits, where no one cared initially but then decades later everyone wants to buy the thing. That is, cases where almost all of the royalties would be acquired after the 28 year mark if the copyright term were longer.<br><br>I claim that case c) is extremely unlikely, and that the law should not be optimized for it. In both a) and b), the publisher/author/... have gotten their well-deserved $, and it has become time for the public&#39;s interest in having artistic works available to override the creator&#39;s interest in getting paid.<br><br>Furthermore, a shorter copyright term is an incentive for people to make more stuff because they can&#39;t just sit on their one success forever.<br><br>However, we might want to allow a non-corporate creator control over their universe and the right to live off their one big hit, so a &quot;life of the author OR 14 + 14, whichever&#39;s longer&quot; term could be good. Than one bit&#39;s a complicated issue.<br><br>[1]: It should be noted that I want with 14 as opposed to some other small two-digit number like 15 because that&#39;s what it used to be ages back.<br><br>- Tomash</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve noticed that the last census was in September 2016. Since July, who apparently did it originally, has left the PPC community since, the position has been vacant ever since. <br><br>Now on to my actual point; does anyone object to me copying last year&#39;s questions and answer possibilities for this year&#39;s census?<br>Secondly, if the above is not the case, are ther any questions you&#39;d like to see included this year?<br><br>~Akrinor</p>

            <p>Hey there, Smiley! I&#39;m Twistey, a new-ish but pretty active Boarder who gets too many ideas. My fandoms are numerous, my fandom OCs even numerous-er (just kidding, more numerous), and my original story characters... Ooooooh jeez.<br><br>Anyway, enough about me, how about you? What are your fandoms? Do you have any notable works of writing or any agent ideas? What do you plan to do here (what types of fics do you want to cover and in what manner)? I&#39;d love to know! :)<br><br>As for your newbie gift, here&#39;s a Cuphead hat. Not like a hat hat, more like a &quot;stick it on your head for a Cuphead cosplay&quot; thing. Cuphead&#39;s head that&#39;s wearable. I don&#39;t know. Give it to your agents if you don&#39;t want it; there&#39;s probably a lot of badfic in that one already and you never know when it might be useful.<br><br>Anyway, nice to meet you! I hope you have a great time here and welcome to the PPC!<br><br>-Twistey</p>

            <p>I&#39;m having trouble getting a handle on my one character.  She&#39;s a World of Warcraft gnome warrior.

How much of her personality is her, and how much is the player.  Why would she go running down a road past mobs that she can&#39;t see the level of to get to a flight point when she shouldn&#39;t know that there is a FP there...<br><br>One of her hobbies is getting into the &quot;behind&quot; places.  In Vanilla, there are a lot of places where the textures and terrain were just not polished because you&#39;re not supposed to be there.  I want her to get to PPC headquarters by falling through the unfinished tunnel near the Ironforge airport.<br><br>I have figured out that she&#39;s not too keen on trusting technology.  On the server I play on, there was a bug where her mechnostrider would constantly malfunction.  I also want to have a story about the time she fell off the deeprun tram and had to run down the tunnel.</p>

            <p>I just read the talk page on Permission.  <br><br>I apologize for asking for public feedback on my character concept.   I didn&#39;t realize that was wrong.<br><br>***<br><br>It seems like people were talking about making the page easier to read by making it more concise?  Right now, there seems to be a lot of information and I can see someone missing something important because it&#39;s buried.  Or just forgetting something because there&#39;s so much to absorb even if they do read every word.<br><br>Someone also mentioned that it was confusing?  I can see them getting caught up on whether or not you need to use the prompts because the FAQ seems to indicate that it&#39;s okay not to use them but people would rather that you did use them. Is it leftover from an old version of the process? (I think I once read a complaint that all the requests started sounding the same because of the prompts.)<br><br>I don&#39;t have any examples handy, but it the past I&#39;ve had an idea for something to happen, and the story turns away from that moment for something completely different but good.  Well, my Supernatural fic was going to end one way, but that changed when I haven&#39;t even gotten to that scene, and it will probably change again.  One story that I didn&#39;t write down was about something in the middle of the ocean that caused all sea life to leave and a ship going to investigate.  All I could come up with was a story about two sailors watching dolphins and talking about their families with no mention about the phenomenon they were going to go study.<br><br>The first prompt I rolled had me a bit worried because I really couldn&#39;t figure out how my characters were going to do one and the other one is possible but I have reasons to reject it.  I found another prompt set where I feel I could try both of them.  (I won&#39;t go into more detail unless you agree to ignore the cheating.)</p>

            <p>I realized that most of the overpowered meta characters are the ones that can actually manipulate the world outside the game, and that where you&#39;re going is a good direction to go with it. However, characters can also be Mary Sue or just really annoying when they only are aware of everything else, so you have to set a good limit for how much your character knows (or has a gut feeling to do, guessing by your word choice) that the player knows. For instance, if the player uses online guides, from my perspective, she should know some of the strategies the player picks up, but nothing about whatever NPCs there are that she didn&#39;t learn from in-universe experiences (motives, etc.) I remember being part of a collaborative work back on Scratch where I (deciding to function as a villain) stated my in-universe motives in the comments of a project and another guy (functioning as a prominent protagonist) <i>made his in-universe self know them</i> a couple remixes later, even though I hadn&#39;t said anything in-universe about them. It wiped out all the drama and conflict of the side plot that I wanted to create in the span of one line of dialogue, and it was just frustrating. So yeah. Don&#39;t make your character know any NPC&#39;s motivations, that&#39;s Sue territory.<br><br>The whole thing about saves and reloads is tricky territory to navigate. I suggest you analyze some Undertale characters, canon and original, to get a feel of where that works and where it doesn&#39;t.<br><br>I do like where you&#39;re going with the gut-instinct thing (and if that&#39;s not what you were going for, then consider that my suggestion!) This seems like an interesting idea for a character, and I have a feeling that since we all care about how well we write, this will come out well (even if you must make a few errors to get there.)<br><br>-Twistey</p>

            <p>I&#39;m probably going to write the meta as &quot;there are leveling guides that they can get in-game&quot; and acknowledge that she&#39;s not using a full one.  Some people use a book called &quot;Atlas Loot&quot; to talk about what what different bosses drop.<br><br>In Dark Legacy, there was actually a character that was named WoWhead.  <a href="http://www.darklegacycomics.com/105"><a href="http://www.darklegacycomics.com/105">http://www.darklegacycomics.com/105</a></a>  In Flintlocke&#39;s Guide to Azeroth, one character yelled for a laptop so she could look up the quest.  <br><br>Someone could have talked to her about where good leveling zones were and how to find the flightpoints, with some inaccurate information if I remembered something wrong.  This also covers anything I learned on an alt, though realistically it could have been things directly told to her by a guildie.  (Guild chat and general chat, meta information is that she has a miniature buzzbox.)<br><br>My druid did once get an in-game mail from a trainer that said &quot;talk to me when you&#39;ve reached the 16th level.&quot;<br><br>I&#39;m not going to have her remember anything about switching to an alt when guildies were calling for dungeon runs.  When she mails things to alts, it&#39;s the same as sending stuff to a guildie that could use it.<br><br>That actually reminds me of something I did in-game that fits with her story.  My guildie was requesting bear flesh to level up her cooking.  I remembered that I got through those levels by fishing in Feralas.  When I mailed her the fish, I included information on where to find the recipes in the mail.<br><br>I noticed that WoW bags still seem to work within PPC.  I assume they are physically small and can hold an entire set of armor without being heavy.  Maybe they work more like bags of holding?  In-universe, I think Trojie might have had a Bag that was made in DoSAT.<br><br>I&#39;ve also heard of PPC characters who can read the Words during interludes to get insight into what their partner is feeling.  I might play with that a little bit.</p>

            <p>Part of it depends on how meta you want her to be and how YOU want to write it, what you feel comfortable with and such. It would be tricky to be in a situation that you can&#39;t describe very well in words, despite it working out in your head.<br><br>On one side of the scale is strange compulsions and urges. She might say something like, &quot;The other day, I had this strange urge to dash through a dangerous part of the world. Most of the monsters there would have killed me, but I just did it. I don&#39;t know why. I stumbled upon a flight point, which was convenient, but I couldn&#39;t think of anything else to do so I went home.&quot;<br><br>Then in the middle is the Dark Legacy stuff. She would know stuff respawning, debuffs, and corpse running, but not that she&#39;s part of a game. It would just be everyday to her. In the real world, she might say something like &quot;Wow, everything&#39;s open-world! There aren&#39;t any instance portals or loading time!&quot; She&#39;d sort of blank out and forget what she was talking about and say she went AFK, or she might get drunk and pass out, then say that she disconnected.<br><br>On the other side, there&#39;s full awareness. Maybe she knows that she&#39;s being controlled and just assumes that this is life, or she resents her player. When the servers go offline, she complains with other characters about level grinding and how she really wants a new transmog. <br>Or maybe she&#39;s the only one who knows she&#39;s a game character. She would walk up to a random guy and say, &quot;Hey, your gearscore is awful&quot; and he would just walk away and say she was crazy. She would be one of those people who goes to bars and says to random people, &quot;Do you ever wonder if you&#39;re a character in a game, and your choices are being made by someone else?&quot; before being kicked out after the seventeenth time. Basically the resident crazy person/conspiracy theorist.</p>

            <p>*nod*  Thanks.  I&#39;m still kinda iffy on how she is.<br><br>I tried writing out her life as if she had a backstory before becoming an adventurer and then suddenly there was another presence in her head influencing her... I didn&#39;t like it.  The backstory I wanted conflicted with lore anyway, according to some RP guides I read.<br><br>I&#39;m kinda feeling that who she is was unstable when she hit the PPC... Kinda the threads of a person, who I imagine her to be when playing without really getting a coherent person formed.  Basically make her be a collection of random traits before she fell through the plothole and then only &quot;wake up&quot; afterwards.  Maybe there would be some scraps of her player leftover, but she doesn&#39;t know what a TV is.<br><br>It&#39;s like when writing a character.  I can say &quot;this person did this&quot; for chapters, then suddenly they start talking to me and telling me who they are after I&#39;ve been working with them.  The surprises can be disconcerting.<br><br>When I was playing WoW commercial years ago, my previous Gnome warrior was very angry and stubborn.  She actually whined at me about not wanting to participate in Hodir&#39;s Daily Euphemisms just to get a gem recipe.  My other characters were more laid-back.  My paladin was a complete stoner who would just sorta zone-out and not pay attention to anything while swinging his mace.</p>

            <p>Maybe her waking up somewhere strange is the side effect of being a deleted character. Maybe her player was hacked and she was deleted, sending her through the plothole. If she ever met her player again, she&#39;d be surprised to learn just how much they know about her, like &quot;Wait, how do you know I like to jump over the cracks in the tiles.&quot;</p>

She has memories, at least.<br><br>My dad had an audiobook called &quot;TimeQuake&quot; that I kept half-hearing while doing other things.  It talked about how when the repeat ended, people couldn&#39;t adjust to suddenly having free will again.  Many people ended up falling over at the bottom of escalators, while the other hemisphere had less injuries because everyone was in bed.<br><br>She&#39;s not going to freeze up when she hits HQ.  I&#39;m thinking that while the &quot;reality&quot; of the PPC is more forgiving than a Reality Room, it&#39;s still going to start tweaking her fundamental nature.  She&#39;s going to lose some abilities and have to re-learn others, though she still will have the muscle-memory for her simpler attacks.<br><br></p>

            <p>So I just joined up with the Discord app for another chat group, and thought I&#39;d ask about this one. Clicking the lounge link sent me to Google play. Should I just send my username and ID for someone to connect me to the chat?</p>

            <p>Hey there! I&#39;m Twistey, an amateur game dev/writer/etc and lightly-used-bie. I have lots of fandoms, OCs, and original worlds. I tend to focus on gauging the Sueness of characters and the levels of social responsibility in stories (ignoring stuff that&#39;s the fun kind of incorrect, like Wolfenstein 3D.) I am really active on the Board on the weekends and other days when I&#39;m not busy all day. <br><br>But enough about me, how about you? What are your fandoms? Do you have any prominent pieces of writing? Any agent ideas? What do you plan to do here? I&#39;d love to know more! :D<br><br>Finally, for your newbie gift, here&#39;s a replica of the Spear of Destiny from the Wolfenstein 3D sequel (ish) of the same name. Give it to your virtual self or your agents and it&#39;ll look impressive anywhere! (Sadly, you can&#39;t summon demons with it. Giving a newbie the real Spear of something that actually functions akin to the real Spear would be bad.)<br><br>Nice to meet you! I hope you have a great time here and welcome to the PPC!<br><br>-Twistey</p>

            <p>Hi! Welcome to the board! I&#39;m - well, you know who I am, it&#39;s right there above the subject. In any case, I read a lot of fanfic, mainly bad ones because they make me laugh. I am currently working on an original world that I discovered hidden in my google drive. So, for your newbie gift, have a piece of eden from Assassins Creed, It could be whichever one you want. If you don&#39;t know Assassins Creed lore, it defaults to the Apple of Eden.</p>

            <p>Combine high-efficiency solar panels, pykrete construction for the bodywork, and silver wiring along the wing and tail vanes for heat dissipation, and you can definitely have a low-heat flight solution similar to that Project Helios thing that was wandering around recently. Indeed, it&#39;d be able to transfer a lot of heat away from everything - one feels that the array of propellors would also be useful in this regard, as heat from the motors could be transferred out through the whole mass structure and radiated out through dedicated points that aided its profile.<br><br>If this seems elaborate, well, you&#39;re the one who made magic hats into heavily armed snowbeings.
