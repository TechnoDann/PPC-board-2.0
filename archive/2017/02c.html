            <p>Okay, so having been gone for a long time I&#39;ve now returned and wanted to ask a question about permissions. I&#39;ve spent a bit of time catching up with stuff and now my girlfriend is really interested in co-writing some stuff with me.  (To be fair she&#39;s a better writer than I anyway.) <br><br>So my question is, does she need permission to co-write with me, or does it just carry under my own already approved permissions?  I realise that in order to &#39;fly solo&#39; as it were she&#39;ll need to get permission for herself, but when we&#39;re writing together using my agents is mine enough?</p>

            <p>Cowriting with someone who has Permission is OK; it&#39;s assumed that the person with Permission can keep the other one in check, if needed. Of course, if your girlfriend would want to write on her own, she&#39;d need to ask for Permission for herself.</p>

            <p>Okay, first of all, welcome back! Returnbies are always nice. ^^<br>Anyway, as for your question, I&#39;m not a PG (and don&#39;t even have Permission myself) so this is purely in my own opinion, but I think she&#39;d also need Permission. It&#39;s granted mostly based on your own writing skills, after all, and that doesn&#39;t mean anything about what your girlfriend&#39;s writing is like. If she&#39;s a good writer, I guess it would be easy for her to get Permission, at least! Though coming up with your own Agents if you don&#39;t necessarily plan on using them much might be a problem, I guess.</p>

            <p>When I started writing PPC missions, I cowrote with a friend who didn&#39;t have Permission, but was allowed to as long as I was writing with her. There was a stipulation that she would have to get Permission as well at some point in the future, but she left before that could happen. I know we&#39;ve had other, similar arrangements in the past, too.<br><br>So I&#39;d assume the same would hold true for your girlfriend. Good luck! :)</p>

            <p>I literally facepalmed at the mention of wings. Like, come on! How obvious of a Sue did the author want her to be?<br><br>A few errors I spotted:<br>1) <i>I’ve got Lindsey’s third birthday party to plan next month, and now we’ve got a new baby on the way as well we’ve got to reorganise the second bedroom, not to mention the fact that I’m trying to petition the Flowers to give us a bigger Response Center, can I not trust you to stop Lindsey from trying to play at being an agent for five minutes?</i><br><br>I can tell that the effect is supposed to be that it all came out as one sentence. However, there would still be natural breaks in the speech. Consider adding a word (which would help with the natural rhythm of the sentence) and repunctuating, thus: &quot;I’ve got Lindsey’s third birthday party to plan next month, and now <b>that</b> we’ve got a new baby on the way as well<b>,</b> we’ve got to reorganise the second bedroom<b>—</b>not to mention the fact that I’m trying to petition the Flowers to give us a bigger Response Center<b>;</b> can I not trust you to stop Lindsey from trying to play at being an agent for five minutes?&quot;<br><br>2) <i>Steven instantly dropped the half-built crib, and it shattered as he hit the floor, but was still beaten to the console by a furry blur.</i><br>As written, the <i>crib</i> was beaten to the console. One pronoun can make a world of difference: &quot;Steven instantly dropped the half-built crib, and it shattered as he hit the floor, but <b>he</b> was still beaten to the console by a furry blur.&quot;<br><br>3) <i>Before Sasha even had time to formulate a response her husband and the Ewok had stepped through a portal and into the word world beyond.</i><br>Missing comma: &quot;Before Sasha even had time to formulate a response<b>,</b> her husband and the Ewok had stepped through a portal and into the word world beyond.&quot;<br>Also, &quot;Word World&quot; is capitalized.<br><br>4) <i>With an exasperated sigh she reached down, picked up the broken crib and began to head into the bedroom.</i><br>Two missing commas: &quot;With an exasperated sigh<b>,</b> she reached down, picked up the broken crib<b>,</b> and began to head into the bedroom.&quot;<br><br>5) <i>Silently Wallis pointed up at the words, shaking his head.</i><br>When referring to the text of the fic, the word &quot;Words&quot; is capitalized. (You&#39;ve missed this throughout the mission.) Also, you missed a comma after &quot;silently&quot;.<br><br>6) <i>Gods this is going to be a bad one isn’t it.</i><br>Two missing commas: one after &quot;Gods&quot;, and another before &quot;isn&#39;t it&quot;.<br><br>7) <i>Wallis nodded, grabbing Steven’s arm and pulling him down behind a rock as Lion-O and Lena seemed to materialise out of nowhere.</i><br>Lena isn&#39;t a canon, and this is her first mention in-fic. Mark her as the Sue. Consider this fix: &quot;Wallis nodded, grabbing Steven’s arm and pulling him down behind a rock as Lion-O and <b>the Sue, called Lena,</b> seemed to materialise out of nowhere.&quot;<br><br>8) <i>And first charge, giving her own suspension capsule the exact same failing as Lion-O’s.</i><br>That comma should be a colon.<br><br>9) <i>“Okay, yes, if they knew she was a Sue then they would be only too happy to see her go, but still…” his voice trailed off as he watched the words.</i><br>Capitalize the &quot;H&quot; in &quot;his&quot;; this is an altogether new sentence.<br><br>10) <i>At least the lack of description means we could still be anyway,</i><br>&quot;anywhere&quot;?<br><br>11) <i><b>She felt some satisfaction as<em></b><br>My brother will</em></i><br>I&#39;m guessing that those underscores were meant to be em dashes?</p>

            <p>Aunt Wikipedia, do your thing:<br><br>&quot;<i>Fat Thursday is a traditional Catholic Christian feast marking the last Thursday before Lent and is associated with the celebration of Carnival. Because Lent is a time of fasting, the next opportunity to feast would not be until Easter. Traditionally it is a day dedicated to eating, when people meet in their homes or cafés with their friends and relatives and eat large quantities of sweets, cakes and other meals usually not eaten during Lent. Among the most popular all-national dishes served on that day are pączki in Poland. or berliner, fist-sized donuts filled with rose marmalade, and faworki, French dough fingers served with lots of powdered sugar.</i>&quot;<br><br>So... have some plates of pączki.

            <p>...what goes into those, exactly? As in, the filling? Because I&#39;d swear those are sufganiot (jelly donuts in the English, don&#39;t ask *me*). We eat them around Chanukah, and they&#39;re absolutely the most delicious things around.<br><br>...mainly, though, I&#39;m just really glad you have them, because *everyone* should get to try a good sufgania-or-something-similar-to-one.<br><br>(I&#39;d hazard a guess as to whether pączki and berliner donuts are the same thing or not, but that Wikipedia sentence is...kind of ambiguous if you don&#39;t already know what it&#39;s talking about, and I&#39;m not sure. Either way, I can confirm that sufganiot don&#39;t tend to be filled with rose marmalade: they&#39;re more likely to have jam of varying types and qualities, chocolate, caramel...all sorts of things. If you&#39;re ever in Israel around Chanukah, check out the bakeries--they have <a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-xUmupz58Vgk/UMTPOjNpplI/AAAAAAAAAlI/OmXNMvxWso0/s640/suf.jpg">SO MANY TYPES</a>. And that link is just from one bakery, too.)<br><br>Anyway. The sufgania as a cross-cultural thing? I am SO ON BOARD WITH THIS.<br><br>~Zing</p>

            <p>Today we&#39;ve got four big boxes of &#39;em. One with strawberry jam, one with custard, one with advocaat cream and one with rose hip jam. SO yeah, I&#39;d say pączki and sufgania are pretty much cousins.<br><br>Pączki are usually covered with powdered sugar, icing, glaze or bits of dried orange zest (Remember Jacob Kowalski from <i>Fantastic Beasts</i>? His Grandmama was Polish!). As far as the Wikipedia says, the difference between pączki and berliners is that the former are made with &quot;rich dough containing eggs, fats, sugar, yeast and sometimes milk.&quot;</p>

            <p>On the 12th and 13th of April, I will (probably) be travelling to Brussels for a pair of rather dull conferences. Because it&#39;s two days, I&#39;ll be staying overnight - which means I&#39;ll have the evening of the 12th free.<br><br>Do we have anyone who&#39;s close enough to Belgium that they feel like popping in for a micro-Gathering? I won&#39;t have transport, so I can&#39;t really go anywhere outside the city, but I&#39;d be happy to wander around for an hour or three with any PPCers in the vicinity.<br><br>Hey, look, I <i>said</i> it was a long shot. Unless we have anyone living north of Paris or west of Frankfurt, the physically-closest PPCer might well be Scapegrace. But I had to ask, right?<br><br>hS<br><br>Unrelated PS #1: <a href="https://www.iau.org/news/pressreleases/detail/iau1702/">The IAU has officially confirmed the themes for naming planetary features in the Pluto system</a>. They match the pre-existing themes, with some additions. The main shift relevant to us is that the &#39;writers associated with Pluto&#39; category has jumped from Pluto to <s>Fandom&#39;s Moon</s> Charon, but I don&#39;t think it was used anyway.<br><br>Unrelated PS #2: Fan of coins?

            <p>If you&#39;re posting something to the Board - badfic or otherwise - it&#39;s great to do it in a way that invites the most discussion. A single link doesn&#39;t do much of that, so why not take the time to tell us what&#39;s bad about it? If you can work in a question - say, if there&#39;s an aspect of it you think might be difficult to PPC, you could ask about that- that&#39;s even better, but I know it&#39;s not always possible.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>When you come down to it, I&#39;d say most protagonists <i>expect</i> things to go their way (except the ones in hopeless wars, I guess). The key is that, for the realistic ones, it <i>doesn&#39;t</i>.<br><br>The interesting thing about <i>The Princess Bride</i> - book or film - is that virtually nobody actually given what they want, for vast chunks of the story. Instead, they spend their time getting captured, thwarted, stabbed in the middle of their climactic fight scenes, dying... come to think of it, even the <i>framing characters</i> don&#39;t get handed what they&#39;re after (such as &#39;people liking the Morgenstern&#39; or &#39;the kid listening quietly&#39;).<br><br>What <i>The Princess Bride</i> does, and does exceptionally well, is take all of those &#39;I didn&#39;t get my way&#39; and turn them into &#39;so now I&#39;ll make it happen myself&#39;. Comedy aside, the characters are extremely proactive - even Buttercup, despite being a literal Damsel In Distress. They have to actually work to get to their goals. It&#39;s not something you see all that often, even in good literature (see: Harry &quot;I was sneaking around for kicks and I stumbled across the <s>Philosopher&#39;s</s> <s>Sorcerer&#39;s</s> Philosopher&#39;s Stone).<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>She&#39;s the one who resolved the Tough Guy Stare-Off on the edge of the fire swamp by trying to compromise. An incredibly naive compromise which has exactly the opposite of its intended effect, but which determines the entire rest of the story. She agrees to marry Humperdink in exchange for Wesley&#39;s freedom.  Later, she realizes that giving up the man who climbed the Cliffs of Insanity for her is kind of a jerk thing to do, and takes steps to get him back -- which fail, because again she naively assumes that Humperdink is a decent person who isn&#39;t plotting to kill her. The reason she expects Wesley to come for her is because she thinks he&#39;s in command of a fleet of pirate ships and has been sent a message explaining the situation -- the reason this is an unrealistic hope is because he&#39;s lying dead in a basement. She&#39;s perfectly proactive, but the problem is, her plans are inane. She spends so much time trying to think and plan: she&#39;s not that bright, but she shines what light she has constantly. I admire her a great deal.<br><br>--Key practically has the book memorized</p>

            <p><a href="http://kotaku.com/heres-the-official-trailer-for-middle-earth-shadows-of-1792780562">eg here</a><br><br>Which raises an important question:<br><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/Inscriptions.png"><br><br>What do the Tengwar say?<br><br>(What, you thought there was any question more important?)<br><br>The text on the anvil is fairly predictable - it&#39;s the Ring inscription. The lower-right segment is readable as &#39;ashnazggimbatul&#39;, which... yeah.<br><br>The ring itself, though... (oh, btw, that&#39;s a New Ring of Power - where does that come on the charge lists? ^<em>^ But if there&#39;s one person allowed to make one...) well, it&#39;s not part of the Ring text, and it&#39;s not even written in the same mode. Note the lack of vowel-signs over any of the letters.<br><br>Instead, it looks like the Mode of Beleriand - the mode used for the inscription on the Doors of Moria, so points there. It says:<br><br><i>... mmof cwch hw(?) (?)occh...</i><br><br>... which you may note is gibberish.<br><br>Okay, so maybe it&#39;s upside-down? Except it can&#39;t be, because there&#39;s a very clear <i>hwesta sindarinwa</i> in there - it&#39;s the one that looks like a lowercase d with a tail.<br><br>It&#39;s not a portion of the inscription on the Doors of Durin, clever though that would be. So let&#39;s try the next theory: that it&#39;s actually English text typed using a Tengwar font. This is an unfortunately common problem: Tengwar fonts are laid out differently (so the series 1 &#39;t-p-c-q&#39; runs along the first column of the keyboard, &#39;1-q-a-z&#39;), so it&#39;s worth a stab:<br><br><i>...em the and of Shad...</i><br><br>Dingdingding! There it is. It&#39;s pretty clear that last word is &#39;Shadow&#39; (capital included - it&#39;s the weird both-up-and-down letter on the last word visible). Hilariously, this means the word front-and-centre is actually &#39;and&#39; - nice symbolism there, guys!<br><br>Looking through the trailer again, there&#39;s another shot that shows a little of the word at the start - I see &#39;... deem&#39;, and while it&#39;s not legible in its own right, the word &#39;redeem&#39; would fit the letter-forms. (Suddenly I know how Christopher Tolkien feels trying to interpret his father&#39;s writing!) I think that &#39;and&#39; is supposed to be &#39;Land&#39; - capital-L gives a dot on the font I&#39;m using, so they could&#39;ve cut it out.<br><br>Going back a bit <i>earlier</i> in the trailer, we can get a decent read during the next-to-last strike of the hammer - it actually shows the same side of the ring, and confirms the &#39;Shadow&#39; reading. There might be an extra letter on the end, but it&#39;s definitely not &#39;s&#39;; I&#39;m guessing it&#39;s just a flourish. It also shows us the inside of the ring, which sadly seems to be mirrored.<br><br>So! The New Ring is inscribed to &#39;redeem the land of Shadow&#39;, by someone who doesn&#39;t read very well. So now we know. ^</em>^<br><br>hS<br><br>PS: Oh, yeah, was the first game any good?</p>

            <p>Because the latter it&#39;s pretty darn sweet - the combat is simple, the open world is really neat and the Nemesis System is arguably the best element the studio had done: it ranks the Uruks in sections, each led by a Warchief or a Captain and if you take one out an Uruk of lower status will be promoted to the spot if you take too long or die. <br><br>As far as I know, some criticism was aimed at the story and boss battles.

            <p>And there was analysis.<br><br>So it looks like the issues fall into a few major areas:<br><br>1. Mordor is a lovely place until that nasty dude Sauron comes back after the fall of Dol Guldur. This is massive time compression, obviously - but I think it also follows the precedent of the <i>Hobbit</i> films. Remember &#39;gasp, there&#39;s SPIDERS in MIRKWOOD?!?!&#39;? It&#39;s pretty clear that in the Movieverse, everyone&#39;s opinion is that Sauron and everything associated with him (eg, the Nazgul) are dead, dead, dead. M-e has been a lovely partyland for millennia.<br><br>Is that wrong? Heck yeah. But can we fault a movieverse game for following the movieverse premise? <s>Yes of course we can!</s> It&#39;s tricky to justify.<br><br>2/ Celebrimbor. The game has him a) associated with forging the One Ring, and b) hanging around Middle-earth after dying.<br><br>As far as a) goes, while &#39;Brim&#39;s knowledge was used by Sauron to make the One, that&#39;s as far as it goes. The only contact &#39;Brim had with Sauron after the latter went off to make the One was when he was captured, tortured, and murdered during the fall of Eregion, well <i>after</i> the One was forged. So... no.<br><br>For b), this is actually possible! The idea that Sauron (or Morgoth) could stop elven spirits from heading to Mandos - or that they could refuse the call themselves, if they were messed up enough - is mentioned in HoME. And if there&#39;s anyone Sauron would one to force to stick around - and, for that matter, anyone whose family history might make him do it of his own accord...<br><br>c) Gollum hanging out in Mordor. This is... accurate? I mean, people are complaining about it, but after Bilbo took the Ring, Gollum left his cave and made his way to Mordor. He was captured there, but nothing says he was captured <i>immediately</i>. And we know what a fawning stinker he can be (though the idea that he could see a wraith is... problematic).<br><br>d) General feel. Black magic, mind control, Sauron&#39;s groovy lieutenants, the &quot;good guy&quot; murdering his way through Mordor, the whole resurrection malarkey... you could probably justify each bit of it by reference to various chunks of canon (Sauron was called the <i>Necromancer</i>, afte rall), but put together it feels... yeah, wrong. The magic in particular - I&#39;ve just (re)played the <i>Battle for Middle-earth II: Rise of the Witch-king</i> campaign, and the Angmar Sorcerers, while cool, give off the same vibe: it&#39;s something that&#39;s never even been hinted at in canon, and feels like an imposition from some other world.<br><br>I&#39;m inclined to agree that it has capital-p Problems with canon, and that the sequel will only make things worse. It looks like the issues get bigger in the details, too, which would bother me immensely.<br><br>I see it&#39;s available on Steam; I&#39;ve put it on my watchlist. Maybe if it drops down to £5 or so I&#39;ll buy it and find out for myself.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Hey folks. So, you had my return to the PPC a little while ago. And you guys might be wondering &quot;what the heck was Herr doing during that time?&quot; Well, I was doing a lot of things, and not all of them in the realm of badfic mocking.<br><br>Well, okay, that&#39;s partly untrue. I spent quite a lot of time making fun of bad fanfiction on the Library of the Damned. I think some of you guys might have seen some of my snarks that I did post here before I dropped off the PPC&#39;s radar, but if you want a primer, here are some of my favorite snarks:<br><br><a href="https://literarytravesty.wordpress.com/category/mass-effect/parallel-realities/"><a href="https://literarytravesty.wordpress.com/category/mass-effect/parallel-realities/">https://literarytravesty.wordpress.com/category/mass-effect/parallel-realities/</a></a><br><a href="https://literarytravesty.wordpress.com/category/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/the-prayer-warriors-the-evil-gods-part-one/"><a href="https://literarytravesty.wordpress.com/category/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/the-prayer-warriors-the-evil-gods-part-one/">https://literarytravesty.wordpress.com/category/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/the-prayer-warriors-the-evil-gods-part-one/</a></a><br><a href="https://literarytravesty.wordpress.com/category/camp-lazlo/beyond-twilight/"><a href="https://literarytravesty.wordpress.com/category/camp-lazlo/beyond-twilight/">https://literarytravesty.wordpress.com/category/camp-lazlo/beyond-twilight/</a></a><br><a href="https://literarytravesty.wordpress.com/category/kitchen-sink/twenty-warriors/"><a href="https://literarytravesty.wordpress.com/category/kitchen-sink/twenty-warriors/">https://literarytravesty.wordpress.com/category/kitchen-sink/twenty-warriors/</a></a><br><a href="https://literarytravesty.wordpress.com/category/mass-effect/when-youre-strange/"><a href="https://literarytravesty.wordpress.com/category/mass-effect/when-youre-strange/">https://literarytravesty.wordpress.com/category/mass-effect/when-youre-strange/</a></a><br><br>But I&#39;ve also been up to two other longer-term projects. The first has been a Mass Effect/Beyond: Two Souls fanfic that&#39;s meant to deconstruct one of the badfics I snarked above. It&#39;s still ongoing, and it&#39;s coming out bit by bit. And oh yeah, it&#39;s nuts. So here&#39;s a link to it on Archive of our Own:<br><br><a href="http://archiveofourown.org/series/76768"><a href="http://archiveofourown.org/series/76768">http://archiveofourown.org/series/76768</a></a><br><br>And lastly, I&#39;ve actually got non-fanfiction stuffs going on in furry fandom, which I&#39;ve joined more recently. I&#39;ve started doing stuff for a fantasy basketball league/writing clique called, predictably, the Furry Basketball Association (FBA for short), and I&#39;ve got a bunch of characters for that.

I&#39;ll see if I can&#39;t get a mission out some time soon-ish! (Unless I need to re-apply for Permission. Hey, can&#39;t hurt to check!)</p>
