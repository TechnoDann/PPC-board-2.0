            <p>I recommend Terraria, if that&#39;s part of the sale. It&#39;s sort of like Minecraft, but 2D, slightly more linear, and with way more NPCs and bosses. Word of warning; you will probably die a lot while getting used to it. And I mean A LOT, especially once you hit Hardmode. Still, it&#39;s fun, it&#39;s addictive as all get-out, and I&#39;m really enjoying it.<br><br>Also, my 12-year-old cousin recommended A Night in the Woods after hearing that I liked Undertale (which I also highly recommend, by the way, Toby Fox is a Goddamn genius); can anyone who&#39;s played it weigh in?<br><br>I guess now&#39;s as good a time as any to finally pick up Portal 1 and 2...though I should probably be saving my money for more important stuff...aheheh.</p>

            <p>While I’m here, I spotted a tiny mistake in one of the previous interludes, &quot;Illogic Bomb&quot;:<br><i>Ripper accidentally tipped his bowl and spilled a bit his drink onto the table.</i><br>I guess this should be &quot;a bit <b>of</b> his drink&quot;.<br><br>And in the current birthday interlude:<br><i>... my author decided I was best suited to Remnant in light my characterization.</i><br>Shouldn’t this be &quot;in light <b>of</b> my characterization&quot;?<br><br><i>— a sectioned bo <b>staff staff</b> like Nami’s —</i><br>I may be wrong, but I don’t believe that a &quot;bo staff staff&quot; is a thing in any word world.<br><br><i>“Hey, good to see you again!” he said, beaming.</i><br>I guess &quot;he&quot; is Chris talking from the console, but using his name instead of &quot;he&quot; would make this clearer; there’s a confusing lot of people around.<br><br>I’m looking forward to getting the still spoilery answers to the quetions I would like to ask from your future writing.<br><br>HG</p>

            <p>Didn&#39;t post earlier because I have reactions to the interlude:<br><br>- The pun in the title was good<br>- That subtitle is reassuring, somehow<br>- I can see why Ripper would go for that birthday present, going off of species<br>- I like the description of Ripper&#39;s &quot;don&#39;t ask&quot; look<br>- &quot;What to do with the meat&quot; is going to be a running theme, I expect<br>- I&#39;m not, in general, a fan of Rashida being insulting and such, but character flaws are important things, so let&#39;s consider just a snapshot of my opinion<br>- There&#39;s a &quot;Rosh&quot; in there somewhere. Typo?<br>- The exposition-bearing dialogue about various peoples&#39; species was well done<br>- Ok, I&#39;m now slightly confused [at the part where everyone meets Lilac]. Is Rashida in the RC or not? And whose voice was coming from in there?<br>- Falc, what in the world did you mean by that &quot;supposed to be&quot;? ... Well, whatever you were getting at, some sort displeased reaction was totally called for there on Lilac&#39;s part<br>- &quot;...won&#39;t have you upstaging...&quot; seemed like a noticeable shift from Falchion being super-apologetic a moment ago, but that could just be me<br>- I can feel the interleaved, swirling conversation after Chris phones in, so if that&#39;s what you wanted to represent, you&#39;ve done it<br>- Everyone&#39;s rather aware of the fourth wall. I can&#39;t seem to put my finger on if the specifics of that awareness are unusual or not. If it works, it works, though.<br>- [around when Valon gets in] Wow, there&#39;s a massive pile of characters in this thing<br>- Falchion is rather insistent on keeping this about him (not a criticism, really, but an observation)<br>- The knife is a nice present<br>- Either that kiss was came somewhat out of nowhere or it was set up in something of yours I haven&#39;t read.<br>- Threats of a shield-hammer seem appropriate under the circumstances<br>- Not having cake can be a logistical challenge<br>- That does sound like a good birthday thing<br>- Meat situation is still somewhat unresolved, semi-disappointingly, but the bit about cooking was funny<br>- I like the bit near the end with Rayner and E.V.L. It was funny.<br><br>General thoughts are that this was conversation heavy, but it&#39;s an interlude, so that&#39;s sort of expected. The long speech was well done as far as long speeches ago.<br><br>Hope this isn&#39;t too confusing and maybe even helpful.<br><br>- Tomash</p>

<li>Ripper&#39;s gift is supposed to be an indication that he&#39;s still getting the hang of PPC social customs, even after all this time, and probably never will entirely gel with the human ones at least. It&#39;s inspired by some depictions of theropod dinosaurs offering meat or carcasses to potential mates, so as to avoid violence during courtship (the T. rex &quot;date&quot;<br> from <i>Walking With Dinosaurs</i> is a good example). I too am slightly disappointed that I didn&#39;t get to do more with this gag, but I may reserve the meat itself as a Chekov&#39;s Gun of sorts for a later date.<br>- Rosh is actually Falchion&#39;s new nickname for Rashida (I have to thank Dalton for coming up with that one). And Rashida&#39;s growing out of her habit of being mean is definitely intended as part of her character development. She&#39;s absent from the RC in this scene, though, so it&#39;s Lilac who&#39;s talking.<br>- I guess the moment Falchion realized it was his birthday, his mind defaulted to a slight &quot;It&#39;s All About Me&quot; mentality, something which I myself am guilty of from time to time. It&#39;s a bit inconsistent, sure, but it fits us both. XD<br>- I wasn&#39;t planning on including Valon and Kala, but since Voyd was online at the same time as eatpraylove and I when we were writing the interlude, I decided it would be neat to ask if he was willing to have them included and I&#39;m glad I did. :)<br>- Lilac&#39;s smooch isn&#39;t entirely out of nowhere, but mum&#39;s the word about the build-up to that. I will however say that it&#39;s the first of a few clues to her origin that I&#39;ll be scattering throughout my writings about her once I properly introduce her to the PPC. I will ALSO say that her in-universe debut was in late 2016, shortly after a certain thing I have planned for Falchion and co. that I&#39;m not going to spoil. ;)<br><br>Thanks again, both for your feedback and the birthday wishes! *hugs*</li>

I stayed up late and in the corner of our shared bedroom (Before I had my room finished, I was sleeping on a sliding sofa) read the first three chapters right away.<br><br>Hmm, the next books came to me in a variety of ways. The second I got, once again, from my aunt. The third one I bought myself while on a shopping trip for shoes. <i>The Goblet of Fire</i> I actually borrowed from a classmate, but accidentally tear a little of the final page... So we&#39;ve decided to buy her a new book, and I got to keep hers. The next two I actually got pre-ordered so that I&#39;d get them right on the release day. And... I think I bought the last one the day after Midnight Release.<br><br>So yeah, good times. I still adore the series, and even though there are some things I would like to see play out differently, I wish to thank both the author, and the fanbase for the best eight years of my childhood! :D<br><br><s>Also, as far as I&#39;ve heard, the US version changed the name, because the majority of Americans were unfamiliar with the lore and legend behind the Philosopher&#39;s Stone...</s></p>

(Set March 2017).<br><br>--<br><br>Next up, the re-releases! These are all related to the Purim RP. I’ve been running it every year since 2014, and I’ve generally opened with some form of drabble. I thought it was about time that I gave them their own documents and posted them as semi-canonical. There’s also one in the list that’s never been seen before!<br><br>So, without further ado, save to say that I have no record of any betaing (but that if it happened, I’m quite grateful):<br><br><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CsZ2JSIOPygBNlQBmSezRiYANgcj_ktyznjK1dQ76x0/edit?usp=sharing">The Purim Party Invitation (2014)</a><br><br><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AOtnp-Y-XjqwFMqCE_kozoNbkyfoY5tb1Xlv7F39dSI/edit?usp=sharing">Two Elves and a Song (2015)</a><br><br><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nCnRt__EqrHlZTeJOiPjMufz8qdsfQhPWMqmnku3xFU/edit?usp=sharing">Tales in the Nursery (2016)</a><br><br><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OgVHXKj5vYwspUjVUrufvbRKQg0FSyWUW2s7ps01ZDk/edit?usp=sharing">Come As You Aren&#39;t (set Purim 2017)</a>, <b>not previously posted.</b><br><br>--<br><br>As you may have guessed from both the last story on the list and the fact that it’s now almost July, <b>I will not be running the Purim RP this year.</b> Should anyone else want to make it happen, you’re quite welcome to; I ask only that you (a) check with me first and (b) let me look over the opening post for accuracy. I can also provide you with the collected past opening posts (and the partially drafted one for this year), if you want; I’m pretty sure all or most of them are now off the Board, and I’ve got the formatting preserved. Those contain the usual rules, as well as bits of introductions (like &quot;what is Purim?&quot; and &quot;what happens at this party?&quot;)<br><br>There will at some point be a post explaining why the Purim RP isn’t going to happen (at least, not by me) this year, but I’m no longer sure when that’s going to go up. I’ve been drafting it since…well, it was certainly in the works by May. However, I then proceeded to go on vacation, and right now I’m in the last days of packing to go abroad for a year and don&#39;t have much time for anything else. At this point, it’s just going to take as much time as it takes: packing takes precedence.<br><br>In the meantime, stories! Enjoy? Comments welcome!<br><br>~Z</p>

            <p>...is a Jewish holiday. It celebrates the salvation of the Jews of the 4th century BCE&#39;s Persian empire, and of the Jews of the capital city Shushan (often written as Susa in English). King Ahasuerus&#39; advisor, Haman, had plotted to destroy them all on a specific day; in the end, the actions of the secretly (until that point) Jewish Queen Esther saved them. There&#39;s a good deal more detail than that, which can be found in the biblical Scroll of Esther or in various summaries online.<br><br>Today, Purim is still celebrated all over the world. Its name comes from the word for &#39;lots&#39;, which were cast on Haman&#39;s orders to tell him which day to choose. The requirements are to hear the Megillah (scroll) read, to give gifts to friends and to the poor (generally food items for the first and just about anything for the second), and to have a festive meal. Traditions include dressing up (as anything remotely appropriate, with the Purim story&#39;s characters being popular especially with children--basically, anything goes but it&#39;s not generally like Halloween with its rash of &quot;sexy ____&quot; costumes), eating three-cornered cookies with filing which are called hamantaschen in English (via Yiddish...), and drinking until you can&#39;t tell Haman, the villain, from Mordechai, a hero (Esther&#39;s uncle who raised her after her parents died and saved the king&#39;s life once and--well, for all that he has two recorded bits of dialogue, he&#39;s quite important). The drinking is &quot;ein ohNESS&quot;--not obligatory. (The wording comes from a feast in the first chapter of the scroll--basically, there&#39;s plenty to drink but no one is forced to drink it.)<br><br>In the PPC... basically, it becomes a themed party RP. Somewhere, someone in the PPC is throwing an annual Purim party. And everyone is invited! Including Boarders, if they&#39;re a bit discreet--not that the agents know that. Permission is not required. Costumes are highly encouraged. Refreshments are provided. I keep meaning to put in a bit of personally recorded megillah reading--it&#39;s sung, as all Jewish biblical texts are--but haven&#39;t gotten past making the recording to date. Maybe I&#39;ll post it in the next one.<br><br>Hope that answers some questions! Past that--go forth and learn, if you so choose! (Or ask me more questions, I guess. That&#39;s a thing too.)<br><br>~Z</p>

            <p>Hi everyone. I&#39;d like to see if people would be up for playing Citation Needed, a panel game ostensibly about Wikipedia articles but mostly about tangents, diversions, puns, and general mayhem. Here&#39;s an example episode, in which the rules are contained:<br><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TsEGt841pw">&#39;Mad&#39; Jack Churchill and a Live Studio Audience!</a><br><br>If you didn&#39;t click the link, and that&#39;s fine, the rules are as follows.<br><br>The host (in this case, me) has a Wikipedia article open and the contestants can&#39;t see it. The host asks them questions about it; every question they get right is a point and a *ding!*, and particularly good answers receive the PPC&#39;s special prize of MYSTERY BLEEPRIIIIIIN (oh ~yeah~). The contestant with the most points at the end of the game is the winner, who will be in receipt of an amusing and incredibly laboured pun for a prize. No expense has been spared; we have in fact killed them all.<br><br>So, who&#39;d like to play! Ideally, I&#39;d love to get the sections recorded as well, and have people in the chat to listen, react, applaud, and generally make it feel more like a radio show. There&#39;s three panelists per show, but I&#39;ll be rotating the panels so everyone can get a go. =]<br><br>Sign up here, express interest, and if enough people want it then we&#39;ll set a date! =]</p>

Finally, after the CDU delayed the vote for 4+ years, it has passed 393-226. The bill still has to go through the Bundesrat, which is expected to happen, on 7th July.
