            <p>I&#39;m working on a crossover on FFN, and one of my readers basically told me that he was inspired to write a story in the same style. I looked over at his profile--and found that his writing needs help. I already spoke to him about it, and he&#39;s willing to accept some concrit, or even a beta, for his story.<br><br>If anyone is familiar with <i>Bakugan: Battle Brawlers</i>, or if you&#39;re good at giving concrit and aren&#39;t averse to doing some research on the Bakugan Wiki, could you please hop over and give a hand? I would gladly do so myself, but I know that once I start meddling, I&#39;d go all-in and start betaing: not something I think that I have the time for at this point.<br><br>The fic: <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12309195/1/Bakugan-Plan-B">Bakugan Plan B</a> by Bakuganfan01<br><br>Summary: <i>New Vestroia is in danger! Aliens who call themselves &quot;Vestals&quot; have invaded New Vestroia and enslaved almost all Bakugan. Drago decides to immediately call the Brawlers for help. Will they save New Vestroia?</i><br><br>From what I could gather after skimming the first chapter, it appears to be an AU of <i>New Vestroia</i> (the second season) with some elements of <i>Gundalian Invaders</i> (the third season) mixed in. So far, I&#39;ve caught<br>* script format<br>* numerals instead of words, and<br>* underdescribed settings.<br><br>If anyone is willing to help, please feel free to shoot him a PM, and tell him that son-of-heaven176 (note the dashes instead of underscores) sent you.

Charges include overuse of capitalization, particularly in the chapter titles, misunderstanding of the connotations of certain Japanese words, driving canons out of character, misunderstanding Mary Sues as a whole, driving canons out of character, being a total brat, irritating and pointless Author&#39;s Note&#39;s, driving canons out of character, a seeming hatred of dialogue tags, and, of course, driving canons out of character. Replacement may figure into it, but it will require a tad more assessment.</p>

I seen you in Discord, like, all the time. I&#39;ve bounced ideas off you (I trust you enough to be a story adviser; does this mean I trust you with your own? Heck yes.), I&#39;ve RPed with your characters. I got to watch them develop as you readied for Permission. I like &#39;em. You got plans to rein in their more OP sides. Gold star.<br><br>Can you write? You got betas. Good show. I&#39;ve seen your unedited RP posts and you know how to do SPaG there, too. And your prompts and bios look solid; there were a few punctuation errors, but nothing major aside from using carrot brackets to show your characters thinking. They&#39;re not Andalites; use italics instead, for thoughts and for the Flowers. Flowers don&#39;t use quotations for their speech. Make sure to italicize those continua, too. :) Basically, SPaG is mostly good, and nothing that a beta or two can&#39;t catch.<br><br>As for storytelling, I think you&#39;re good. The control prompt was a bit lacking in funny, but it was engaging nonetheless, and it was a nice showing of how your agents met.<br><br>The second prompt was better; I laughed when Apecian fell in the Floating Hyacinth&#39;s tank. <br><br>And the fic to spork: I took one look and NOPEd out.

            <p>Glad to see that you have finally got Permission! <br><br>To be honest, when I saw you in your times at Discord, I knew that you would definitely earn your Permission like a true and proper author. You have helped me with a few things in my fanfic, and for that, I give you my thanks.<br><br>Anyway, enjoy your permission, and have fun being a official member of the PPC. I&#39;ll be doing my best to earn my place among them, as soon as I gain the confidence and skill to apply for Permission, but in my eyes, you&#39;ll be one of the better ones, no matter what happens.<br></p>

            <p>I found <a href="https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12337323/2/"> this fic</a> on the Pit. It has Harry kill Voldemort at the Battle of Hogwarts in his sixth year, where the Elder Wand explodes and everyone at said battle except Harry dies.<br><br>That&#39;s just the start. I&#39;ll let the summary by the author, Aisyaz, do the rest.<br><br>&quot;A 5 year old Harry wished to be somewhere else than with his aunt&#39;s family on the night of his 6th birthday. Now 10 years after that, his wish came true? This is a creature fanfic. Slash. Harry might be having 8 mates, but who knows? *Grins* Rated as K for now. will change as story progress. I&#39;m bad at summaries but do take a look!&quot;<br><br>Fic is SFW as of Chapter 2, but definitely NSFB.</p>

            <p>I do think Gimli could be broader/stockier, actually, and the beard more full and scraggly. It&#39;s a bit more wizardly than Dwarvish, if that makes sense—maybe it&#39;s reminding Iximaz of Saruman or Gandalf the White?

            <p>I&#39;ve stockied up Gimli (by cutting his arms off and moved them outwards), and scraggled his beard. The other thing I&#39;ve done is refer back to the trailer pic of him and disconnect the two halves of his moustache, which had a big impact (I think).<br><br>I&#39;ve also tweaked Legolas&#39; head, though in the process his shoes seem to have gone awry. I really don&#39;t like feet, though Dot&#39;s worked out okay.<br><br>I&#39;ve also made an attempt at shadows (instead of just shading); I think I need to work on the colours used for them, or possible just use a darken brush and let the computer sort it out, but it looks a lot better than the non-shadowed version.<br><br>I&#39;ve also bitten the bullet and shrunk the brush used for faces, which has had a big effect on the ability to differentiate people.

            <p>... that would be if I&#39;d said that I was going to model Gimli on Phobos. ^_~ Canon characters still look as close to the movie as I can get them. I&#39;m not averse to molding bit-part fanthings to look like their voice-actors, though... well, within reason!<br><br>But so far as I know, there is no canonical depiction of Lina Holling. [Checks; takes an hour to archive the OFUM fanart page] No, I take that back: there&#39;s one (insofar as fanart is &#39;official&#39;), and it looks like <a href="http://s66.photobucket.com/user/TangledWebs/media/PPC%20Archives/misssandman/Lina.jpg.html">this</a>.<br><br>About all I can make out is a suggestion that she might have quite wide hips, and of course her hair length.

            <p>2a/ Actually, <b>most</b> student names in OFUM and HFA and probably many other OFU stories are taken from people who volunteered themselves/their fangirl alter egos. The main protagonists mentioned in the first chapter usually exist before there are any fans of the story. (OFUDisc and some others may be different.)<br><br>3/ As far as I understand OFUM and HFA, magic makes it impossible to write any fanfic for the continuum if you don&#39;t have the license to write, so even good authors must apply – or at least take the final tests – in universe to get the license. That is, if you don&#39;t assume that OFUs just gift licenses to good authors for free.<br><br>HG</p>

Even if you don&#39;t know about &quot;Wolverine and the X-Men&quot; specifically, it would be nice if anyone who had an X-Man knowledge could pitch in, or if anyone who&#39;d be willing would pitch in for a second opinion, especially because this mission has two possible endings and I can&#39;t decide which one to go with.

            <p>One of the best things about this is how clearly everyone&#39;s emotions come through. Specifically, you do a good job of showing me the inside of Ix&#39;s head (which is not a very nice place) without it being overblown. The second half, where Ix realizes the truth, is very moving and heartwarming, and it looks like things&#39;ll be looking up for the two of them. <br><br>In other words, going off the text, Ix is will on her way to getting all the love and hugs she desperately needs. </p>

            <p>Us in the Discord&#39;ve been thinking of doing something for Singles Awareness Day, so we&#39;ve developed the idea of a Speed Dating RP. A host would take the list of interested agents and make sure each member of every set interacts with the other agents at least once. <br><br>The RP partners will, of course, be entirely at the discretion of the agents&#39; respective authors, though we encourage having a quick RP with as many people as possible.<br><br>The number of posts allowed by either party will be treated more as a guideline than an actual rule, but we needed a way to simulate the time limit. <br><br>The identity of the host is undecided (I&#39;m personally a fan of a Generic Host, with a mysterious identity), and may or may not actually exist, depending on whether or not we have an odd number of interested agents. <br><br>I myself won&#39;t be able to attend throughout the affair, but I do have a few concepts I&#39;d like to put through their paces, so I&#39;ll probably show up at some point. Might even try my hand at being the Mysterious Host. Anyone interested in throwing their agents to the wolves, feel free to volunteer them below!</p>

            <p>I&#39;m far too busy this week and the next with phone screens and interviews, and I also have to help field a construction estimating workshop in Indiana the weekend after this one. Besides, even if I was interested I don&#39;t think any of my agents would be - more than half of them are already &quot;taken&quot;, as it were, and I have some <b>SUPER TOP SECRET PLANS</b> for the ones that aren&#39;t which would preclude any relationships to speak of.<br><br>About the one agent whom I could see participating is Falchion, which is painfully ironic because I myself am <b>horrible</b> at dating (the two instances where my family tried to pair me up with someone else have not worked out well, and I don&#39;t know the first thing about how to form romantic relationships in general). I have yet to see any currently active female avian agents, though, so I kinda doubt he&#39;d be interested either unless or until one comes along. ^^;</p>

            <p>A small rectangle of fine cardstock has been slipped under your RC door. It is an invitation, in elegant script, to a get-together with fellow . . . interested, parties. </p>

<p>It proceeds to detail an event in which agents will be given a chance to get to know one another. A bit like speed dating. If you have received the invitation, you are already on the list of participants, and a place has been set for you. </p>

<p>Of course, your attendance is at your discretion. </p>

<p>The interesting part for the inquiring-minded agent is this: the invitation gives directions to an address within central HQ (near the Lounge, in fact). </p>

<p>This address has never existed. </p>

<p>Your investigation leads you to a door of rich, warm mahogany, and inside you find a warmly lit room, dominated by gas lamps and candles.</p>

<p>The ring of tables is covered with a deep red tablecloth, a single lamp on each providing enough lighting that you can see your partner, but little enough for it to feel . . . private. Additionally, a card of the same material as the invitation marks your place at the table. It bears your name, in the same fine script as the invitation which brought you here.</p>

<p>The Mysterious Host sits at (his?) table at the back, the two halves of the ring sweeping towards his like wings. His table is slightly more shadowed, his chair richer and higher-backed and his table smaller. There may even be a place beside him.</p>

<p>All you can tell of his appearance is that he is dressed in elegant clothing, and seems to be smiling warmly. He raises his his glass, full of deep red liquid, in greeting, and brings it to his lips.</p>

<p>Of course, your attendance is at your discretion . . . </p>

            <p>The Host looked on at the revelry as the last few grains of sand fell into the bottom of the hourglass, rotating it without needing to examine the display. </p>

<p>He made a few adjustments to his mental list, and seemed to grow still for a moment. Another signal went out, and had the agents been watching, they would have noticed their cards grow a little longer as the name of the person they had just met with appeared at the top.</p>

<p>As the agents shifted, new tables became apparent, as if they had always been there. Interestingly, there was just enough additional room to seat the newcomers.</p>

<p>Regardless of whether the guests were paying attention or not, they would feel something from their placecard as another set of instructions appeared below the names of their current dates, guiding them to their next partners, who are as follows: Harris and Apecian; Chris and Shamrock; Mia and Kei; Lou and Naergondir; Randa and Kaatah; Cat and Lu; Finch and Thorn; Alleb and Steele; Miguel and C; Michael Tanner and Michael Green; Jesse and the Mysterious Host; Ami and Sonia; and Bingle and Apollo.</p>

<p>The newcomers would find their names elegantly written on namecards at their appropriate tables, and the attached directions were enough for those already in attendance to find their respective partners, even if they had never encountered one another before.</p>

<p>As the evening moved onward, the Mysterious Host smiled at Jesse, beckoning him toward the open seat across from him.</p>

<p>((First things first: This is <i><b>not</b></i> the end of the first round. This is me attempting to open up the door for our later arrivals, and giving people a bit more to do every day. I was thinking that each conversation should have about ten posts for player, but that is not a hard and fast rule. Secondly, please post your agents interactions for this round as replies to this post, to keep this thread from becoming impossible to navigate. Finally, these pairings are, ultimately, random. I rolled dice, I did not decide who anybody would be seeing. Thank you. That is all.))</p>

            <p>Jon jumped slightly at Lirene's words, even though she was walking calmly beside him and had been since they'd left their RC. "Oh--yes, Lirene Sedai." Even after being partnered with him for over a year, she had to suppress a wince at his voice. It sounded like desiccated leaves being pushed across stone by a whistling wind. Not at all the kind of voice you want to bring on a date. Jon fished in the pocket of his sunshine-yellow robes, then pulled out a pair of Ray-Bans. He stuck them on his face, then turned to look at her, cautiously hopeful. </p>

<p>"Much better," she said, smiling slightly. She still wanted to shudder as his eyeless face turned towards her and <em>saw,</em> but it was a little more manageable with the glasses. It felt very strange to be walking so calmly beside a Myrddraal, but Jon was harmless. He practically fainted at the sight of blood--even Sue blood. He nervously adjusted his lank black hair, trying to make it hang appealingly. That was impossible. Lirene briefly considered placing a Mirror of Mists on him, to make him look human, but she didn't. He'd firmly rejected the idea of using the disguise generator to alter his appearance--it was the only thing she'd ever seen him firm about--and she didn't want to slight him.</p>

<p>"I think this is the place, Lirene Sedai," Jon said, stopping in front of a handsome mahogany door. </p>

<p><em>A year later, and he still uses the honorific,</em> she thought. It was sweet, if anything about a Myrddraal could be thought sweet. "I believe you are right, Jon," she said. "There are no female channelers inside that I can sense. You should be fine."</p>

<p>Jon tapped his fingers together, frowning at the door. He looked remarkably like a young pangolin. He started. "Oh," he said, then reached forward to open the door. His movements were fluid and snake-like, as always; so at odds with his gentle personality. </p>

<p>Lirene walked into the dimly-lit room, appreciating the subtlety of it. She <em>was</em> Cairhienen, after all. <em>Though,</em> she thought, glancing down at the bright green of her dress, with its yellow slashes, <em>I do still have more of the Foregate in me than anything.</em> </p>

<p>She took her invitation card from her belt pouch, but found no new directions on it yet. By the twist of his pale lips, Jon had no directions either. "Come," she said, walking to an empty table. "We will wait together." </p>

<p>She hoped she wouldn't be forced to bind anyone in Air to keep them from killing her partner. It was always such a hassle afterwards. </p>

<p>((A new agent pair joins the fray! I'm just experimenting with them. They're from <em>The Wheel of Time,</em> if anyone is curious. Jon is a <a href="http://wot.wikia.com/wiki/Myrddraal">Myrddraal</a>, though he's had a personality added (obviously), and Lirene is an <a href="http://wot.wikia.com/wiki/Aes_Sedai">Aes Sedai</a>. It should be noted that, despite his demeanor, Jon really is terrifying to look at. A common phrase in WoT is "The look of the eyeless is fear." It's an involuntary reaction, almost, to something clearly inhuman. </p>

<p>Also, Aegis: Larfen and I were wondering if it'd be okay to pair Lou up with Jon? She's has been idle for a bit and we both think she and Jon will be a lot of fun to write together. </p>

            <p>She walked here, she walked there, she walked up, she walked down. Duane never actually said that he didn't know where he was, but Lou was deeply aware that he didn't. He tended to get quiet and sweary, when he didn't know things and didn't want Lou to know that he didn't know those things. </p>

<p>'Gosh, Duane. Since you don't know where Narrary-Gondy is-' she paused, grinning at Duane, waiting for him to stop swearing quietly. 'I'll have to ask someone. Who knows things, Duane.' So she stepped along, a skip in her step and a smile on her face. Her plan went as follows: </p>

<p>Step 1: stop when I find someone who looks like they know things. </p>

<p>Step 2: ask them about those things they know (like 'Where's Nareygwondlir?') </p>

<p>Step 3: have a great date with Nphfaregondir and get married and have babies (not right now, maybe a bit later)</p>

<p>The plan was unstoppable, as far as Lou saw it. No matter what butt-things Duane said with his butt-mouth. </p>

<p>She stopped almost instantly, quivering in the air like an arrow that's just hit a target. She looked to her side. There was a man with sunglasses, sitting at a table, some woman opposite to him. A brief wave of something cold and clammy and dark that might have been terror swept through her and disappeared when it hit the other side. He looked like the type of person who knew things. Duane wanted her to walk away and find someone else, for some reason. </p>

<p>'Hello!' she said to the man who looked like he knew things. 'Hi, I'm Lou. I was wondering if you knew things?' </p>

<p>Duane <i>really</i> wanted her to walk away and find someone else. That was a bit odd, Lou thought. </p>

            <p>"Uh..." he said, his voice like rotten leather crumbling, "Um, uh, yes? I, I know a few things." He turned his head and looked at Lirene. With his shoulders slightly hunched and his head tilted he looked like a frightened youth, not a creature of shadow. </p>

<p>Lirene felt her mouth try to quirk up into a grin, but she kept it impassive. Her ageless face was the picture of Aes Sedai serenity. She stood gracefully. "Oh, look," she said, peering into one of the dark corners of the room. "I'm quite certain I ought to be over there." She glanced down at her card; it showed no new directions. "Yes, quite certain. Goodbye, Jon," she said, nodding to her partner. "Goodbye, Lou," she said, also nodding to her. </p>

<p>She swept away from the table in a rustle of skirts, leaving her stuttering partner behind. Only when she was well into the shadows did she let herself smile. </p>

            <p>Then she turned to the fellow, Jon, who knew a few things. He had a voice like a gravestone being dragged over gravel. This did not concern Lou in the slightest. 'Oh, gosh, great! See, I need to find Naririgwandor-' she showed him her card. 'But I can't find him and the card can't find him and Duane can't find him. Duane thinks he's not here, and that my plan is dumb, but that just makes me want to find him <i>more.</i>' </p>

<p>'So do you know where he is?' She said, smiling hopefully. Duane, were he not an igneous, volcanic rock of felsic composition known as 'rhyolite' by scientists and 'Duane' by crazy people, would have been squirming to remove himself from Lou's grip. He seemed somewhat worried about something. </p>

The Myrddraal huddled in on himself as if he could disappear into his yellow robes. "I'm afraid I don't know where he is," he said, in a very quiet voice. He cursed himself silently; this Lou wasn't even flinching when she looked at him, and what had he done? Blurted out a foul curse without thinking. She was probably horribly offended. She wouldn't want to speak to him anymore, he was certain. Besides, she was looking for someone else. Jon shrank back into his chair a bit more and waited for Lou to be mad at him. </p>

She stood back, waiting for Duane to have a go at her. He didn't. In fact, he told her that she should move away from this humanoid abomination and hide under some sort of furniture for a week or so. Something Lou didn't recognise ran down her spine. It came to the end and leapt right off, and Lou didn't give it a single thought. </p>

<p>'Wow. Gosh. Duane is really stressed by you, you know.' She held the rock to her ear for a moment. 'He thinks you're a terrible, horrifying beast that terrifies him on a deep, primal, and unnatural level.' She appeared to think of this. Thoughts dashed through her mind. Her face was blank. </p>

            <p>Lirene Sedai had been his partner for a year, and was always kind to him, but she <em>never</em> touched him, not even when he was in disguise. He knew that was specific to him; she was the type to put a friendly hand on someone's shoulder or pat them on the back. Jon couldn't ever remember having someone hold out a hand for him to shake.</p>

<p>Slowly, so she could pull away if she had second thoughts, the Myrddraal took her hand and gave it a very gentle shake, grasping it delicately. He hoped his hand wouldn't frighten her; his skin felt normal to him, but to a human, it probably felt... wrong. </p>

<p>What Lou had been saying suddenly registered. "Duane?" he asked, tilting his head. He focused on the rock in her hand. "Is that... um, pardon, is he your partner?" Were there such things as sentient rocks? He supposed there might be. Lou didn't seem frightened of him at all, but Duane was, so he supposed the sentient rock was the sane partner. He wondered suddenly if he was taking advantage of Lou somehow, if she were insane. If she were sane, she never would have approached him. Was it wrong of him to try to talk to her more, if a saner her would have run away by now? Jon wasn't used to moral dilemmas like this. He wished Lirene were there to tell him what to do, but she had disappeared from her corner and was nowhere to be seen. He bit the inside of his cheek and hoped he wasn't doing something wrong.</p>

            <p>Duane began releasing helpful strategies on escaping from a handshake while inflicting horrendous pain on the part of the opposing handshaker at the same time. Lou ignored him, and shook away. She, in fact, shook away just a tad longer than she would have, otherwise. </p>

<p>'Yeah, he's my partner. Sorry about him being rude,' she said, glancing at the rock. 'He's a butt who's scared of new people and is really loud with it.' </p>

<p>She dropped into the chair opposite to him, observing his hand. Naergondir had disappeared. The plan had disappeared. She would have been struck with a deep confusion, if you asked her about either of those things, at that particular moment. 'Hey, are you human? Your hand feels weird, and Duane keeps calling you things like "monstrosity" and "inhuman." But he's probably exaggerating.' She placed Duane on the table, by her side, with a <i>thunk</i>. 'At least, probably with the "monstrous" one, because you don't seem very monster-ey.'</p>

            <p>To him, "not very monster-ey" was an unprecedented compliment. "I'm not human," he admitted, trying to make his voice sound a little less... like his voice. "I'm a Myr--" no, what was he thinking? "Myrddraal" practically <em>reeked</em> of evil. "Um, a Fade." He thought he should probably try to move the topic on to something else, because if she started asking about what Fades were, he'd have to tell her he was an eyeless abomination spawned by mutated beasts for the express purpose of fighting all that was good and holy. And he had acid blood.  "So, er, why can't I hear Duane?" Maybe the sentient rock only spoke very quietly, or he had some sort of mental link with Lou. </p>

What luck! Lou was glad that she had abandoned whatever it was she had abandoned in order to sit here, doing this, instead. </p>

<p>'Oh, that?' she said, looking from Jon to Duane, Duane to Jon. 'Oh. Well, Duane just doesn't like people, so he only talks to them when he needs to, and he only needs to talk to people when he wants to say something mean or stupid to me.' She paused briefly in consideration. 'But sometimes people don't hear him and they think I'm crazy. But, gosh, I don't think I am. Duane would tell me if I was crazy!' </p>

<p>She tilted her head, looking straight at Jon's sunglasses. Her smile was unnervingly relaxed. 'Gosh. Where are you <i>from</i>?' she asked, half-certain it may have been somewhere in Russia. Russia seemed the kind of place to have Fades. Russia seemed like the kind of place where people had inhuman-feeling hands, and where Duane would feel immense, deep terror. She would have been very surprised if it wasn't Russia. </p>

            <p>Another hard question. He definitely couldn't tell her he was from the Blight, because that would then lead to him having to describe what the Blight <em>was.</em> He also didn't really want to tell her the name of the continuum he was from, because then she could look it up, and <em>then</em> she would realize what he was and be terrified of him. "Oh, um, a bit north of Kandor," he said, his voice sounding like gravel being ground between two slabs of stone. "What about you? You look like you could be Domani," he said, smiling. Then he froze. <em>Jon, you Light-forsaken fool,</em> he thought. <em>She might not think of that as a compliment!</em> "Er, I mean, you look like you might have family from Arad Doman," he clarified. <em>Sheep swallow and bloody buttered onions!</em> he thought, and was slightly shocked by his own foulness. </p>

<p>((The <a href="https://library.tarvalon.net/index.php?title=Arad_Doman#Appearance.2C_Clothing_and_Dress">Domani</a> are universally acknowledged as a beautiful people, but their women wear incredibly scandalous dresses, hence Jon's backpedaling. </p>

            <p>decided that she would be flattered. In anyone else, this would be insincere. The smile would seem fake, it wouldn't reach the eyes. The general mood of the whole thing would go down, just a touch. This was not the case with someone like Lou, whose entire face seemed to brighten up. </p>

<p>'Aw, thanks!' she said. 'I don't know what those are, and Duane thinks you're subtly insulting me, but I don't think so. You're nice!' </p>

There was, of course, an alternative possibility regarding a woman sharing a table with him on a night specifically designated for dating, but Lou very specifically went out of her way to ignore that one.

            <p>Boring was a relative thing, Lou knew. There were people out there who hunted boars and who fought fires and who got shot in wars who weren't excited at all. There were people out there who stopped leaping off cliffs for fun, because they had ultimately decided that leaping off cliffs wasn't fun and that they simply didn't feel the rush, anymore. Jon was in the DMS - and he found it boring. 
<i>Boring!</i> 
Lou was astounded. She widened her eyes, just a touch. Her heart was beating a lot more conspicuously than it usually did. She was feeling quite warm. Gosh, she thought. </p>

<p>'It's boring,' <i>boring</i> she thought, still astounded, 'too. It has lots of variety, though, so the boringness stays fresh. Gosh.' She glanced at the table. She glanced at Duane. She ignored everything he said.</p>

<p>'I don't think you'd have boring stories. Are you sure they're boring? They might not be.' She was feeling quite warm. </p>

            <p>Jon thought he must have had at least <em>one</em> heroic moment in all of his missions. Lirene Sedai couldn't have had all of them... could she? Jon thought about his partner for a moment and realized that yes, yes she could. </p>

<p>So stories of Jon saving the day were in short supply. What else did he have? "Oh," he said, alighting on a particular mission. It didn't exactly leave him looking like a hero, but it didn't make his partner look like one either. It'd have to do. "Once, while Lirene Sedai and I were on a mission in Narnia, the Sue managed to knock both of us into the ocean," he said. He chuckled, remembering the sheer outrage on Lirene Sedai's face after the pink-haired Suvian had shoved her off the side of the Dawn Treader. That was a good story, wasn't it? Jon suddenly realized that he didn't have any practice telling stories. Were they supposed to be longer? He watched Lou's face for her response. </p>

            <p>The tension, the sheer suspense. She wanted to know more. She <i>needed</i> to know more. She felt like she was truly there, salty water lapping at her neck, sea breeze running over her hair. Duane, meanwhile, was telling her how, not only was it a terrible story, it was also the last terrible story she would ever hear in her life, because this man was going to steal her soul and eat her and make her into a rug. Silently, awed eyes still on Jon, she took Duane off the table and placed him on the floor. 'Shut-up, Duane,' she murmured. </p>

Lou was just sitting there, smiling, talking about the things a <em>normal</em> Myrddraal would do (well, it would probably kill everything in the room if it could; Jon wasn't sure about eating souls and making rugs out of human skin. <em>He'd</em> never done that, anyway) while Jon sat across from her, like a snake pretending to be a harmless worm. He couldn't do this. He liked Lou, and he didn't want whatever friendship (or relationship, though he hardly dared hope for that) he had with her to be founded on lies. </p>

<p>"Lou," he said, his voice like stone crumbling to dust, "I--I should have told you this sooner, but--" Rolling his lips together to keep them from shaking, he reached up and took off his sunglasses, revealing his smooth, eyeless face. "S-Some people call my kind Fades, but our--our proper name is 'Myrddraal.' Lou, Duane's <em>right</em> about me. I mean--" he added, hastily, "not me <em>specifically</em>, but all <em>other</em> Myrddraal are evil. They'd do all the things Duane is afraid of. I, um, got lucky. A bad parody fic gave me a personality, and instead of killing me, the agents that missioned it recruited me." He looked down at his hands, toying with the tablecloth. "I, um, I'd understand if you want to--I don't know--punch me or something." That was a normal response to being lied to, wasn't it? Jon wasn't sure. In any case, he braced himself.</p>

"N-No," he managed, sounding a bit choked. "No, he's--he hasn't been bothering me. Has anyone ever told you that you are remarkable?"</p>

<p>He felt his card shift and fizz in his pocket. He groaned. "Oh, no, Lou, it--my card wants me to go." He pulled it from his pocket, glaring at it. If looks could kill, the card would be fine, because he had no eyes to look with. But if <em>anger</em> could kill, the card would be a small pile of whimpering ash. </p>

<p>He read the new directions, then stuffed the card back into his pocket, anger turning to misery. No one else in this room would be half so kind as Lou, he was sure.</p>

            <p>This was not out of any sense of stoicism or hard-hardheartedness or anomalous control over her bloodstream, it was more out of the fact that she was largely blind to pretty much anything that would have made someone blush. Her most common response to such circumstance, as such, was usually a scrunching of her face, a raising of an eyebrow, a pause and a 'What?' Lou did not do any of these. She blushed. </p>

<p>'Oh, uh. Gosh. No, not usually. Much.' She lowered herself to the table, a tad. It was all feeling a touch dreamy. A little bit floaty. Was it warm? </p>

<p>She felt a fizzing from her own pocket. She looked up at Jon, frowned right back to him. She smiled, immediately afterwards. 'We can do this again! What's your RC? Mine's 333-nine. The door has the paint on it.' </p>

            <p>Steele looked around to see if there was anyone who looked like an Alleb. Hmm... well, she never was any good at telling someone's name from their face before she'd learned it. After a bit more of a wait, she decided to see if her card had directions... well, would you look at that. It did! Following them led the deer-girl to a table occupied by a very strong-looking female. "Hello! Are you Alleb?"</p>

<p>(I learned from my mistake last time! Here's a mostly SFW description of Steele: <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kXo-LT7IYel7FwPiJN_x9U3Y93fc4N9QcIskqJytMNg/edit?usp=sharing">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kXo-LT7IYel7FwPiJN_x9U3Y93fc4N9QcIskqJytMNg/edit?usp=sharing</a>. There were some things about her that I really kind of wouldn't have felt right leaving out, but anything that I deemed NSFW had been highlighted in black. These are optional reads, mostly there as a sort of "if one studies the right spot, one can see..." thing.)</p>

<p>Taking a deep breath, she straightened her spine and raised her chin slightly. At least Steele didn't <em>tower</em> over her when she was sitting. "I am afraid I do not know what you mean," she clarified, in a steadier voice. "'Into'?"</p>

Some people dealt with it politely, or not at all, like Lady Alleb. Others, she thought, remembering the officer on Tavros Station, dealt with their discomfort through racism and hate.</p>

Like, if I were in that universe, I'd be over here, living a normal life, but my twin would be a <em>knight</em>, which is such a cool idea. Ahem. I'll stop fangirling now. If you do end up getting them, though, I heartily recommend the audiobooks; they're read by the author, and he does a really good job. </p>

She felt like... like that time she'd tried to fix the Casstech and had been royally shocked. All her muscles were quaking; it was almost all she could to to stay upright.</p>

<p>(She, ah. I haven't actually thought about that much. I've been meaning to write a slightly-extended document detailing how she and Lu met, some memorable moments from a smattering of universes (actual badfics optional), and sort of generally fast-forward to when C comes in. I may go back and write a few missions from 'before' eventually, but... well.)</p>

            <p>Kei noticed his name written on a card propped up on a table on the other side of the room from where he stood, as clearly as if a spotlight had been shone upon it. </p>

<p>"Thorn, I think I found my spot. I'm, um, going to go now." He pointed a couple times, then waved. She smiled and waved back as he scurried off, cape billowing. She had to admit, it matched his pink hair oddly well. </p>

<p>Her youngest daughter would have loved his outfit. Beulah had been fascinated by the Kerch-style theater troupe that had visited their town in Novya Zem the month before Thorn had had to leave her family and had spent the next weeks scrounging for fabric and paint to recreate the costumes. Although, perhaps Kei's shiny, angular codpiece would have been too much even for the, what was it called, the Komedie Brute. </p>

<p>She was herself feeling drawn towards one of the tables, where she could see a boxy sort of person wrapping up a conversation. It didn't even occur to her to smooth out her yellow floral-print gown before striding over. It would cling; there was nothing to be done about that. She needed to have all her wits about her: she was about to have a conversation with a complete stranger. </p>

            <p>She bent her head forwards slightly and grinned, looking Cat dead in the eye. "I can't speak for how the majority of my continuum works - I was created via roleplay, and my only connection to any 'real' continuum is the continuum used to generate me, so that's the one I consider to be mine - but as for my own story, I was designed to look a certain way. I am a hybrid - my 'base' DNA is that of an arctic fox, layered over with succubus and gryvain modifications. I won't go into the whole story of my life, but--" Lu tapped her eyepatch with one claw. "--Father decided he didn't like me and that I deserved to be given a horrible childhood. I thought he was doing everything he could to make me miserable just because he could. He, on the other hand, thought that he was justly dealing with a 'malfunction' - or so I've been told."</p>

<p>Lu leaned back, accidentally popping her spine with a few sharp cracks. "Now, then... did I answer your question?"</p>

<p>(Lu forgot that they had only a little time to talk - otherwise, she would definitely not have spoken of her past. Feel free to deal with this however you want to; I won't be bugged by any question you have, I promise. Or any reaction, really, positive or negative. Unless you tell me my character sucks, in which case I will go cry in the corner and then desperately try to fix her.)</p>

            <p>What an astute observation, she reprimanded herself. This was not the place for an impeccably-reasoned editorial on ethical obligations. She couldn't fathom what else she was supposed to say, however. All that reading of human books should have equipped her. Lu's situation was just like -- perhaps it did not make sense to descend into fandom mode, either.</p>

<p>"One good thing I can say for the Federation," she found herself saying, "is that they've clamped down on people who play with genetic engineering but won't shoulder the responsibility for having created a person. Your father sounds as if he had a similar mindset to one of those 20th century eugenicists." Her brain finally caught up with her mouth.</p>

<p>"So, you didn't grow up in your home continuum? What was that like? Did you arrive at the PPC after the backstory part of your life was finished, or. . . I don't know much about metafictional realms."</p>

            <p>Was she meant to respond to that last half-audible comment? Maybe Lu hadn't even said it aloud -- some species with poorly-developed psychic abilities leaked stray thoughts, she remembered T'Magu mentioning, after one of their earlier unsuccessful lobbying attempts. She'd been somewhat drunk at the time, though. </p>

<p>The best course seemed to be to ignore the whispered comment, particularly since Cat didn't understand it. Then again, the only way to begin to understand something not understood was to investigate. Cautiously, of course. No assumptions should be made, and utmost tact should be used in the asking.</p>

And I still didn't come here looking for anything, especially not love or whatever the equivalent might be for one such as me. But not <i>looking</i> for something and not <i>finding</i> something isn't the same thing, as a certain memory has decided to remind me."</p>

<p>Lu looked straight at her partner. "I'm still not in love with you. I don't trust anyone this quickly, not with anything, especially not something important. It's just not who I am. But, I suppose, I'd be willing to continue conversating with you after tonight - if that makes sense."</p>

<p>(This is her way of saying that she likes Cat. Again, still not romantically, but she's okay with having her around - which, for Lu, is pretty good praise. She's no people-person.)</p>

His side choices, 'official yellow-belly,' 'executive milksop,' and 'full-time namby-pamby' had all gone that same route. Building Maintenance was all that was left, as he saw it. He never, however, gave up on his ambitions, and worked paranoia and cowardice as a full-on hobby. His skill had grown beyond compare. 
He was, as such, very highly talented in the art of deducing whether or not somebody was walking towards him. His sonic-sensors spiked. Something unique in the levels, something odd in the volume. 
He swished his ocular to the side. Whir, click. It widened, then narrowed. No doubt about it. Moving, towards him. Right towards him - a direct path that led right to him. To Finch.</p>

            <p>She was careful to keep her palms clearly in front of her and kept her tone gentle. She imagined that she was dealing with a spooky horse, albeit one more articulate than she had ever come across back home. "Actually, it wasn't Thorn originally, but Standard Translation took effect while I was filling out forms and, well, everyone calls me Thorn now. I hear that names don't usually translate, but I suspect the translators don't deal with Zemeni very often -- the Grishaverse fandom is pretty small, I hear -- so it's probably full of bugs. So if I say something ridiculous, blame DoSAT!" She laughed a little. "And who are you?"</p>

<p>((The Grishaverse is written by Leigh Bardugo and consists of the Shadow and Bone series (YA trash, better than Twilight but that's about all I can say) and the Six of Crows duology (YA at its best, better than waffles, the current love of my life, I borrowed them from my friend a month ago and refuse to give them back. It's this great tightly-plotted adventure story that's also about dealing with trauma and addiction, and has complex psychology and good writing -- really good writing. I don't want to oversell it because then you'll be disappointed if you read it, but. . . it's important to me). The universe is the best thing for making OCs in: it's many-faceted and interesting, but not fully developed, so there's lots of room for a fanwriter to fill in the gaps!</p>

<p>And by "inappropriate" Thorn only meant not appropriate to the situation! Like how Bingle behaved inappropriately by launching into an intense discussion of weird universe-bending math stuff and folded a table, not like how those people who asked about a "knobbo-wand V44 with tentacle attachments" behaved inappropriately. And there's lots of ways to do the former (and clearly you can think of at least one way to do the latter).</p>

<p>Finch ran 'Grishaverse' through the archives.

He's a little fluffy crab-thing, very shy -- you wouldn't happen to know him?" Not even this narrator, with unparalleled access to Thorn's thought processes, knows how she decided what gender to assume Burd was, considering the Venusian bore more resemblance to an armchair than any man or woman she had ever met, nor how it occurred to her that Finch and Burd would know each other. Perhaps she thought FicPsych held a support group for non-humanoids hailing from unbuilt universes -- or perhaps she was desperate to keep the conversation going. Perhaps she didn't quite know herself. Small talk is terrifying that way: you must swing from one delicate, tenuous, potentially offensive rung of thought to the next. Thorn could navigate the aerial swings with surefingered ease, but once in a while she gripped something she wasn't sure would hold her and had to hold her breath and pray to Ghezen she wouldn't fall into the silent abyss.</p>

            <p>Lou looked from the card in her hand to Duane. 
'Is this me being <i>racist,</i> Duane? Because I can't say his name? Gosh.' She stepped through the room, steadily following the directions. </p>

<p>'That'd be a horrible first impression, wouldn't it, Duane?' 
And there was the table. Lou tried smiling. She didn't want a horrible first impression. Not at all. She wanted a <i>great</i> first impression. Or a good one. Decent. Lou, ultimately, wanted a first impression that was at least a step away from 'horrible.' </p>

            <p>"Harris?" he said to himself. "Huh, this'll be interesting." Following the directions on the card, he found the table he was supposed to be at, although he could have sworn that some of the "<i>Left. No, no, the other left! There, better.</i>"s had not been on there when he first started looking. He slid into the seat opposite the Spy and said, "Hey, Harris. How's it going?"</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Michael had almost thought there had been a mistake when he had first glanced at his card. Then, he noticed the last names that had been conveniently provided. Ah, well, then. He made his way to the table indicated on the card, and sat down to wait.</p>

<p>His eyes subconsciously flicked over to where Sonia was sitting before focusing back on Apecian. "Also, you said you needed something to write with?" he said as he pulled out a small pencil from a pocket. "Take it, there's loads in the Sorting Room. Don't think they'll miss one pencil."</p>

Here's hoping we don't end up at the same table at the end of the night, and that yours goes better." He took the pencil, and started playing with it with his fingers. "Thanks a lot!

How was he supposed to start talking to any of these -- he looked about -- people, horses, robots. . . squirrel-people? There was so much going on! He found a spot from where he could observe and catalogue the shifting shadows on the wall.</p>

<p>Thorn was not worried. She was sure whoever approached her to strike up a conversation would be perfectly lovely. She was eager to begin. She found a spot where it seemed polite for her to wait.</p>

<p>They stood next to each other in perfect silence.</p>

<p>Cat had no such problems. After thanking her host -- she tried to catch a glimpse of his face as he helped her to her seat, but a trick of the lighting obscured it -- she turned to the person nearest her, a cervitaur in a blouse which could only be described as stunning.</p>

<p>"Hello there," she said, "Please pardon me for having bumped your flank on my way in; I was exhausted after such a long walk to get here. I must have been too focused on my destination; I was so eager for the opportunity to make the acquaintance of a beautiful woman such as yourself." She shook her head wonderingly.

            <p>He felt ill at ease, despite Gurnirel's encouragement. He was an Elf of the First Age, one who had seen the light of Laurelin and Telperion in the days before the sun and moon. He had fought in too many bloody wars. His name he had chosen for himself: Man of Lament. It had seemed only too fitting.</p>

<p>And here he was, entering a room full of...'speed daters'.</p>

<p>"You need not find love here," Gurnirel had pointed out the day before. "We are both aware that tragedy follows the pairing of one of the Eldar with a mortal, and there are few of us in Headquarters."</p>

<p>"Then what reason could I possibly have to attend?" Naergondir had asked her.</p>

<p>His sworn sister had smiled. "You might find friendship there, Meldaner. On that, the Valar have so far smiled."</p>

<p>He could not argue with that, even with the Doom of Mandos ringing in his ears (<i>To evil end shall all things turn that they begin well...</i>), and so he had consented to attend.</p>

<p>He had dressed well, as one did for first impressions. His robes were long and blue, in overlapping layers and varying shades. His hair had even more small braids than usual, and bore a shimmering array of tiny gems at the clasps. He bore no weapons save a short dagger at his waist under the outermost robe, and that only in case of unexpected trouble. He had learned not to underestimate any place's capacity for unexpected trouble.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, he had no idea where he was meant to go, and so he stood just inside the doorway and looked around for direction.</p>

            <p>"C. Forwards. Now." The first speaker was a decidedly feminine individual in frame, but somewhat less so in manner. Even before she'd opened her mouth, her eyepatch advertised to any who glanced at her face that this woman hadn't had a cushy life, and the set of her features advertised that she was not wanting to convert to such a life. In contrast to her eyepatch, and her somewhat battered-looking horns (if one cared to look at them), she was dressed in a fine red gown, exposing a pair of armored arms but hiding almost everything else.</p>

<p>"Relax, Lu, she's not one for attention." The creature at the back of the group spoke in a fair voice, but... well, she was very much not human. Her torso and face were, yes - though they were quite a bit higher than the average human female's was - and they were rather pretty for human features, at that. Below her torso, though... well. Cervitaurs weren't exactly common in HQ, but this girl had managed to get her hands on the mods to make it happen. Clearly, she held her human and deer halves to quite different standards; she had worn a stunning blue blouse to cover her human half, and though she technically wore a skirt below it, it primarily served to complete the outfit as opposed to covering anything.</p>

<p>"Steele, thank you for defending me. Lu, I will move as soon as I decide where I would like to go. Besides, standing in doorways makes for a nice picture, if you ask me!" The final girl - or the first, if you were going by who was where in the cluster, as this was the one actually in the doorway - was most certainly the most 'ordinary' of the three. Light skin, brown hair, and completely human. She hadn't worn anything particularly fine, either - a darkly-colored top and a somewhat more lightly-colored skirt, which was nicer than any of her usual attire, but looked extraordinarily ordinary amongst the finery of the room.</p>

            <p>"I wonder what the inside of this room could possibly look like," he added in an unnecessarily loud tone of voice. Thorn was horrified at his rudeness, but she was the shy variant of Socially Inept Nerd, while her partner, she thought, was of the strain that didn't know when to shut up. She clenched her jaw and turned away by a couple of degrees. Perhaps her Afro had grown large enough to bop him in the face, allowing a natural change in topic.</p>

<p>Nope, a couple more centimeters to go. She took advantage of her new position to avoid making eye contact with either Kei or the agents waiting (very respectfully, she thought) in the doorway.</p>

<p>"Maybe there's a good reason they're not letting us in," Kei mused, "There could be a fire! Perhaps we should thank them for being thoughtful enough to," he hitched his volume up a notch, "<em>barricade the door</em>."</p>

<p>The agents didn't react, engrossed in their own conversation, which relieved Thorn and frustrated Kei, who proceeded to fling himself against the wall of the corridor -- and slip down his silk cape, landing him on his butt in a less theatrical pose than he had hoped for. Thorn turned at the noise, and they held eye contact for a dumb moment before folding in half with laughter.</p>

<p>"That's what you get for wearing such a ridiculous outfit!" Thorn hooted softly. Kei could only nod, breathless. "You better take off that ridiculous mask, too, before you poke someone's eye out!"</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" he gasped, mock offended. He patted the beak of his red-sequined mask. "Roxie's my good-luck charm!"</p>

<p>"I don't know." She gave him a skeptical look. "It's hard to figure out if you're attracted to someone if you can't tell what they <em>look</em> like."</p>

<p>Collected, he hopped to his feet and dusted himself off. "My suave masculine charms will shine through any disguise."</p>

<p>Thorn smiled, then whispered, "You're right, though. When are we going to get in? I'm more than ready to find my second husband."</p>

<p>Down the hall, Cat was walking at the fastest clip she could manage towards the door, rubbing her arms to keep warm. The curve-hugging little black dress had seemed sexy and fun in the comfort of her RC, but she'd forgotten that the corridors of HQ were clearly temperature-adjusted for Humans. Or perhaps for snowmen, she thought. Oh well, she wasn't about to turn around and be even later for meeting the single ladies of the PPC -- owwww, her hip. What was she doing again? </p>

<p>Oh, a door. . . right, single ladies! Hurrah! Ouch.</p>

<p>((I'm having fun already! Okay, Kei has no preference with regard to gender or species and is a recent high school graduate. Thorn is lesbian but doesn't know it, so send her women to freak her out; she's middle-aged. Cat is a grandmotherly lesbian who has probably wrecked her hip by walking this far even with her cane; get her a table near the door, please?</p>

<p>--Cat and Thorn, Kei, Burd (not present).))</p>

            <p>Shamrock Alsike came running through the door, tripping over her floor-length emerald green evening gown. A large, bushy squirrel tail poked out of the back of her skirt, and her hair had been done up in elegant braids that fell to her waist. She righted herself and looked around, skin darkening with a blush when she realized most of the tables' occupants were already, well, occupied.</p>

<p>"Shamrock, relax," Randa said, coming in behind her. She pushed her glasses up her nose and looked around, smoothing down her knee-length, sky blue skirt. "I guess we'll take a table and wait for the host to tell us to switch."</p>

<p>"Aw man!" Shamrock wrinkled her nose. "I gotta date <em>you?</em>"</p>

<p>"I feel your pain," Randa said dryly, and sat down at the nearest empty table.</p>

He reached out and tapped on one of the armrests of his chair. Immediately, the cards in the Agents' hands fizzed a bit. Were they to turn them over, they would find instructions guiding them to their first partner of the night. It had been arranged as follows: Harris was to see Lou, Sonia was to see Michael Green, Jesse was to see Ami, Mia was to see Apollo, Chris was to see Kaatah, and Alleb was to see Bingle. He smiled and sipped his glass once more. This should keep things interesting.</p>

He had found his place and sat down all right, but aside from that nothing seemed to be happening. </p>

<p>Typical. </p>

<p>He sighed and scanned the menu for the umpteenth time before rolling his eyes and tossing the card back onto his plate. Boring, boring bo– wait. Was that Sonia?</p>

<p>He craned his head to get a better view. It <i>was</i> her! And she was wearing that beautiful long red dress and her silky, wavy brown hair was down and cascading over her shoulders and... </p>

<p>Harris caught himself staring and tore his eyes off of her. He kept on forgetting that he had no chance with her— best to stay in his metaphorical lane. He picked up his menu again and scanned it again.</p>

<p><hr></p>

<p>Sonia rose an eyebrow as she watched Harris bury his face back into the menu again. She had been quite surprised to see him here— the Pegasus Knight was convinced that he had been planning to stay in the RC for tonight and binge-watch <i>RWBY</i>. She felt the urge to go over to his table and talk to him— he was always a surprisingly good conversationalist and quite funny— but remained seated at her table. Harris did as Harris does—sure, she was placed with him to make sure he didn't get into too much trouble, but she didn't need to shadow him at all times. </p>

<p>Even if he was charming and actually quite handsome and...</p>

<p>Sonia caught herself staring and tore his eyes off him. One of his best qualities was how forward he was— and she was convinced that if he had any feelings for her, he'd have said something by now. She picked up her menu and listlessly read through it.</p>

<p>Trying to relax his smile, he sat in the chair opposite Sonia. He took a nervous sip from his travel mug. On the plus side, all the jittery nerves bundled in his stomach woke him up wonderfully. He barely needed the coffee to remain upright. "So, uh, where do you work?" That was a normal question that normal, non-nervous people asked, right? </p>

<p>How long had it been since he'd had a full conversation with a woman who was not Mia or a Sue?</p>

            <p>The boy was on edge-- the tension in his handshake betrayed his nervousness. She didn't blame him, though: Michael looked as if he had never so much dipped his toes in the dating pool before. </p>

<p>"I'm in Intelligence," she said. "Assigned to watch over the incoming badfic... and this guy over there." She waved her hand at Harris, who looked as if he was literally trapped between a rock and a madwoman. A part of her wanted to stand up and rescue him from his torment, but she couldn't just leave Michael as-is. </p>

<p>"Okay, honest question and expecting an honest answer," she said to him. "How old are you, and is this your first time putting yourself out there? Because, uh... you look pretty young to be chatting up a 21-year-old. No offence."</p>

"Um, I meant to say, I'm seventeen, and yes, this is my first time in the pool. The dating pool. Dating." He stopped pinching the bridge of his nose and instead let his hand cover his whole face, hiding his blush. "Oh, geez," he muttered. On the list of awkward conversations he'd had, he put this just beneath the one back in seventh grade when the principal had mistaken him for his twin sister. That had been a nightmare. "Look, can we just pretend that I didn't say anything there, and that this isn't actually speed dating, and we were forced to share a table at Rudi's or something? 'Cause you're right, the age gap is redonkulus." He paused, looking up at Sonia in shock. <i>I just said redonkulus,</i> he thought, mortified.

            <p>And Apollo really hoped that this event wouldn't become a basis for, or an actual, one. Still it was an opportunity to get out of the RC and try and get to know others who he could become friends, or even more with. He hadn't really had much of a chance to do that back in his home continuum, mostly because of his real occupation and the savviness that most of the inhabitants of the continuum had, he'd known several people who'd lost loved ones due to other people's schemes.</p>

<p>Still, it was a new chance, and so Apollo had decided to dress as well as he could, or at least as well as he could without alerting the attention of Kelly, who would otherwise tease him for going for a long time. And so he was dressed in some semi-formal black chinos and a simple black t-shirt, his normal boots being the only pair of shoes he owned, even if they did make him look more casual than smart. </p>

<p>Beside him, Kaatah shifted nervously as the two walked towards the room where this event was meant to take place, Kaatah had expressed interest in it to Apollo when they'd met up to talk at Rudi's one day in the last week, the inhabitants of RC 9.81 and 1692 often met up as Kaatah had worked with Apollo and Kelly before she'd been assigned to Theo and DOGA. Now that the day of the event had come, Kaatah was nervous, even beneath her normal Colussus suit of armour that she always wore (although Apollo could tell that it'd been cleaned up somewhat), and Apollo could tell. </p>

<p>"Don't worry, you'll be fine, we already went through what speed dating is, right?" He said, hoping it'd calm her down, at least a little bit,</p>

<p>"I know." Kaatah replied, her voice really on edge, "I just don't know what I'm going to do if a Geth or another AI sits down next to me, I kinda wish I hadn't asked Theo to lock all of my normal combat functions on my Omni Tool now."</p>

<p>"You'll be fine" Apollo reassured her. "Besides, if things get really bad, I still have a knife in my boot, and you can borrow that." </p>

<p>Kaatah nodded, noticing they had reached the mahogany door. "Keelah, what is you say? Break a leg?"</p>

<p>Apollo smiled in reply, "Something like that."</p>

<p>With that, he opened the door, gesturing for the Quarian to walk inside before following himself. Noticing Kaatah heading off for her table he scanned the room, looking to see if someone there interested him.</p>

<p>An actuator unfolded from Finch's side and fiddled with the bow tie attached to his front, below his ocular, where a neck would be on a being that used necks. '<b>Alexander the Great-s the most famous world-conqueror, Bingle. Not hearts, the world.</b>' </p>

<p>Bingle shrugged. The suit wasn't designed to shrug. The suit probably wasn't designed to go on Bingle. It looked like it had been stretched and pulled and slapped onto Bingle's body before it could reform into its own shape. 'Surely, Finch, the world would involve the hearts of charming young women?' </p>

<p>'<b>Bingle, don-t do this to me. Don-t bloody do this to me. Not now.</b>' his ocular flicked here, flicked there. It fell on a lit candle, it fell on a very flammable looking tablecloth. It fell on various other people, all of whom did not look as silly as Finch. 
He was painted black, all the way up, all the way down. His display chamber had been emptied. A bottle of wine had been placed inside to fit the mood. Finch had to keep himself from yelping every time he heard it clink or slosh. </p>

<p>'Finch, you look fantastic. Like kangaroo, the second most famous conqueror of hearts of all time!' </p>

<p>'<b>Kangaroos are Australian marsupials, Bingle. They don-t bloody conquer anything except for grassy fields.</b>' </p>

<p>'Historical bias, Finch. Historical bias...' </p>

<p>Lou stepped in, shuffling by the old, rather stretched-looking man and his hovering vending machine friend. Duane didn't step in, because Lou was holding him under an arm. Lou hadn't looked so fancy in years. She still wore her hoodie, still wore her pajama pants. But, for once, she was wearing proper shoes. Black ones. Shiny. And a waistcoat, too, which would have probably looked even <i>more</i> fancy if it wasn't over her hoodie. Duane wasn't wearing anything, because Duane was an igneous, volcanic rock of felsic composition. Geologists liked to call him 'rhyolite.' Lou called him 'Duane.' If you asked Lou what Duane would have called himself, it would have been 'The only worthwhile entity within this horrid mess we call Headquarters.' </p>

<p>'Gosh, Duane. Maybe you're <i>not</i> overdressed,' Lou said, leaning into the rock. 'Look at them all, Duane. That woman looks like an <i>umbrella!</i>' 
Lou wished <i>she</i> was an umbrella. People loved umbrellas. Lou knew <i>she</i> did, anyhow. </p>

            <p>Mostly because she kept bumping into and scurrying around other people who were also trying to find their tables. When she at last collapsed into her proper seat, face still flushed, gown still struggling to contain her, she found herself facing a very tall, very thin, and rather old man. And was that... was his nose <i>wooden?</i></p>

<p>No matter. Lady Alleb, swordmaiden of the Realm, servant of King Eliam, had faced many challenges before. She could face this with ease. She squared her shoulders, putting on a smile like it was armor. "Hello," she said. "My ame is Nalleb, and I--oh, uh, er, I mean, my name--my name is Alleb." Her voice cracked on the last word, as if she were an uncertain squire of fourteen summers. She winced. </p>

<p>This challenge might be more difficult than she had thought. </p>

            <p>If Bingle's body wasn't long dead and largely non-functioning, he probably would have yelped. His nerves, however, did not work. His voice box, too, only worked when he very specifically concentrated, so something all fast and sudden and reflexive like a yelp would have sounded like a the gentle fluttering of dusty paper in a tomb, as opposed to the 'AAAAAGH!' that would have been expected. 
So Bingle didn't notice at all (except for the very faint sensation of something, somewhere being shifted out of place,) and continued smiling placidly. </p>

<p>'Pardon me, then! But you do seem terribly nervous for someone at ease, you know.' He looked at her. He looked at things <i>around</i> her. Not quite <i>her,</i> but relating to her. Trailing behind her, flowing around her. </p>

<p>'Good heavens,' he murmured. 'You know, I was hoping they would have partnered me with one of those immortal fellows. This is now a tad odd, isn't it?' He tilted his head as he said this. </p>

<p>'But, see, a flope - flope is short for "five-dimensional slope."' He gestured away, leaking enthusiasm. 'Which means that you walk forward along an incline, and you can go up-' He gestured up.

            <p>He felt, somewhat, like he was being pitied. He felt, too, what with all the lingering guilt in his head, that this was somewhat deserved. What a very <i>old person</i> thing to do, that was, being pitied.
Bingle didn't usually think of himself as 'old.' He always felt that the aging process was the kind of thing that officially stopped with your heartbeat. You never see people bringing birthday cakes to graveyards, anyhow. And if you did, it was always promptly followed by the sounds of sirens, and groups of men in white coats who work in places with padded walls. Bingle was feeling rather old. Perhaps he should have stayed at home. Read a book, ate some popcorn. Dead men didn't read books and eat popcorn but, then, neither did old people. </p>

<p>'No, reality isn't very fond of that kind of thing. It is both elastic, and very unhappy that it is elastic, you know.' He scoffed, faintly. 'You'd never <i>imagine</i> how it reacts, when someone snaps it. Terrible, very terrible, for everyone involved. And the bystanders and people on the other sides of the street, and a few other people who happened to be unlucky.' </p>

<p>He looked up. 
'Now, generally speaking, plane folding involves the manipulating of. Well. Planes. The planes that make up everything are, when you look at them in quite the right way, flat. Flat, much like paper. It may be folded, too, much like paper. I knew a fellow who folded a ship into a crane.' He smiled at the memory. 'It flapped its wings when you pulled its tail and blew its horn when you pressed its head.' </p>

<p>'I do have books on the subject I am more than willing to lend, but, ah.' He smiled and shrugged. He didn't think this topic liked him very much. 'What do <i>you</i> do, Miss Nalleb?' </p>

'Well, I'm quite certain, anyhow. There must be at least <i>one.</i> Or two, maybe three. A spin-off of one.' He suddenly paused, like somebody had tapped him on the shoulder. He slipped a hand into his pocket, bringing his card out, looking at it. He brought it down and looked at Alleb. </p>

<p>'I believe we must move on to our next partners, assuming my card isn't glitching terribly.' He went to his feet, made a faint little bow that was concerned only halfway with politeness, the other half concerned with not stressing the spine too much and snapping it in half. 'It has been a pleasure, Miss Nalleb! I do wish you luck, and hope you encounter someone more suited to you, in terms of tastes, age, and general state of mortality.' He extended a hand and smiled. </p>

And before Finch could even remind Bingle that Hildegard of Bingen was a nun, famous for being a nun and doing generally nun-related activities, such as not conquering hearts, he had receded into the distance. 
So he turned to the human. First, he observed for laceration hazards. Glasses, could break, could cut. He observed for fire hazards. Green neck tie. Knot unidentified. May burn. He observed for tripping hazards. Shoes, could trip. And so on and so forth. 
His ocular whirred and clicked as he aimed it here, then there, moving constantly. </p>

Putting that particular train of thought aside, hopefully not ever to be put on a track again, Michael said, "I have been well, thank you. Over this last week, the Duty has not been particularly unpleasant, although I do not expect that to last." He hesitated, then added, "May I ask what Department you work for?" Somebody had to begin asking questions, after all, and they didn't have much time to waste.</p>

<p>"Yep!" Jesse answered. He practically skipped through the Generic Halls, looking dapper in a black three-piece suit and starched white undershirt. She found the cut of his jacket odd; its front edge ended at his waist while the back went nearly to his knees in two long tails. He'd tamed his mop of golden hair and hidden it beneath a brimmed cylindrical hat--a "top hat" he'd called it--and had even shaved. He grinned at her, eyes twinkling. Alleb managed to smile back, though she was still tugging at her gown.</p>

<p><i>Well,</i> Alleb thought, biting her lip and peering down the corridor, <i>that's rather easy for him to say.</i> He<i> does not look ridiculous.</i> She looked down at her own clothing, and felt the knots in her stomach tighten. The color was alright--a deep blue--but some madman had designed the shoulders to not be <i>on</i> her shoulders. She kept trying to tug them up; she was sure the whole thing would fall at any moment. Not to mention the fact that the cut revealed two stab wounds and the edge of a long cut on her shoulder, all long healed, but red and ugly nonetheless. And, as if that weren't bad enough, she had a train dragging along behind her, rustling over the Generic Floor and making a nuisance of itself. </p>

<p>Alleb sighed. At least she'd resisted the shopkeeper's attempt to stuff her into one of those "corset" things. She wouldn't have breathed for fear of breaking the laces.</p>

<p>"Hey, I think this is it," Jesse said, stopping in front of a wooden door. His grin returned. He opened the door and swept his top hat off in a bow, ushering her in. "After you, <i>Lady</i> Alleb," he said, his grin never faltering.</p>

<p>Alleb raised an eyebrow and bowed in return. "My thanks," she said, "<i>Sir</i> Jesse." She took a deep breath, squared her shoulders, and marched into the dimly-lit room. It was going to be an interesting night.</p>

<p><hr></p>

<p>Michael Green was tired of a lot of things. He was tired of missions, he was tired of Sues twisting the canon, he was tired of the unrelenting grey of the Generic Hallways. More than anything, though, he was tired of his partner.</p>

<p>They both stopped outside of the mahogany door. Michael was in a slightly-rumpled suit, and had traded in his white ceramic coffee mug for a sleek black travel cup. Mia was in her customary leather jacket, black tank top, and black ripped jeans, her ever-present black sunglasses... present. Michael suppressed a sigh (he had a lot of experience doing that). She might have been original in her method of expressing rage at life in general. She might have opted for an orange jumper, indicating her lack of respect for society's rules of fashion. She might have chosen a red hat, symbolizing her anger for the world. She might have worn a pair of green pants, showing off her disgust for everyone. </p>

<p>But, no, she'd chosen black, as if it hadn't been done a thousand times before. Michael suppressed another sigh. This was going to be interesting. </p>

<p>"Why're we here, Greenie?" Mia growled. Well, she tried to growl. Her voice was too high and feminine for growling, but he had to give it to her, she really did try. "Wouldn't counting loose threads in your suit be a better waste of time for both of us?"</p>

<p><i>Probably</i>, he thought. "We're here so one or both of us can get married and move into another RC," he reminded her. "Then you won't have to deal with me, and I won't have to deal with you." He took a sip of coffee, blinking tiredly at the mahogany door. Why weren't they going in? "Oh," he said, reaching for the handle. Mia scoffed as he opened it, brushing past him into a darkened room. Michael took another fortifying gulp before following her. He hoped she was wrong about this being a waste of time; he really wanted a different RC. </p>

<p>A girlfriend would be nice too, he supposed.</p>

<p>((Alleb and Jesse are in standard 1870s formal wear, as Jesse is from that time period and Alleb unwisely let him shop for her. I couldn't resist stuffing Alleb into the stuff; she's a muscle-bound warrior woman in a sleeveless, shoulder-less dress, from a time period that loved slim waists and the like. Poor girl. I thought about giving her a corset, but she's built like a slightly-feminine bull, so I didn't think that would go well.</p>

            <p>Noting one he felt like he had a good chance at, he set off towards the table, moving confidently through the room. The female currently sitting at the table had short-ish blond hair and was wearing what looked to Apollo, very much like a bikers leather jacket. Interested in the clothing of choice, although aware his clothing wasn't exactly the most orthodox choice for something like this, Apollo approached the table, sitting down on the other side of it, he maneuvered himself so he casually sat side wards on the chair and decided to introduce himself. "Hey, I'm James, just call me Apollo. May I get your name?"</p>

<p>Mia blinked. She'd sounded... <i>friendly.</i> She tucked an errant strand of hair behind her ear, frowning slightly. He must be using some sort of mind control. She hadn't sounded that friendly since her glitter count dipped below one hundred. Her best course of action would be to flip the table and run out of the room before--</p>

<p>"What department do you work in?" she found herself asking. Her eyes widened behind her sunglasses. It must be very <i>strong</i> mind control. So strong, in fact, that she found herself not wanting to flip the table over and barrel out of the room. In fact, she wanted to stay for a while. </p>

<p>She settled back into her chair, steepling her fingers and smiling slightly. </p>

            <p>"I don't know if you've heard of it; it's a really popular show about, well, friendships. The story started when the supreme leader of my country, Princess Celestia, sent her most talented student to Ponyville a few years ago to oversee the Summer Sun Celebration. Twilight--that's the student--was also supposed to make friends while she was there, but she was more interested in the legend of Nightmare Moon.</p>

<p>"See, for thousands of years Princess Celestia and her little sister, Princess Luna, ruled Equestria together by giving us the day and the night respectively. As time went on, Luna grew increasingly jealous of Celestia; the ponies loved her and her day, but slept through Luna's night. Legends said that one fateful night, Luna refused to lower the moon and transformed into an evil version of herself, Tartarus-bent on creating eternal night.</p>

<p>"Princess Celestia banished her to the moon with the most powerful magic she had, but there was a prophecy that Nightmare Moon would come back on the longest day of the thousandth year. Naturally, that was the exact day of the Summer Sun Celebration." Ami paused for air. "Sorry, did I lose you? I get really passionate about things related to the Princesses, and you seemed surprised I was a unicorn so I figured you'd never heard of my show..." Her ears went back against her head, and she blushed in embarrassment.</p>

And the older one rules over the day, and younger one rules over the night, and the younger sister don't know that sleepin' under the stars is the best dang thing a cowboy out on the trails has, so she gets all mad that people're sleepin', and goes crazy?"

<p>She smiled when she realized she actually liked talking to him. <i>Chris was right, I didn't need to worry. He's patient, he listens to me getting excited, he's actually kind of charming for a human...</i> "I don't think you mentioned where you come from, Jesse."</p>

            <p>Both were in formal wear, although Apecian's was more an approximation of such adapted from his usual outfit, the most notable changes being that his shirt had long sleeves and he was wearing a vest in a deeper shade of red than his eyes. Michael, on the other hand, was wearing a traditional tuxedo, with a green neck tie tied in a knot whose name Apecian couldn't remember. Apecian grinned at his partner, who had seemed to relax a bit after seeing the modicum of privacy afforded by the low lighting. </p>

<p>"Alright, you ready?" he asked. His clothes may have been more formal, but his speech most definitely wasn't.</p>

<p>"I believe so, yes," Michael replied quietly. Apecian had been around him long enough to pick up that he was nervous, and scoffed.</p>

<p>"Come on, you'll do just fine," he said. "Go on, find your table." Michael hesitated, but then nodded.</p>

<p>"Good luck," he said, and went in search of his name. Apecian waved to his partner, then started walking around the tables. He managed to find his name rather quickly, and he considered taking a peak at his first date's name. He grinned at the thought of this as a date, and decided against it. No need to ruin the surprise. He slid into his seat, and waited for the other to arrive.</p>

            <p>Some part of his being was whispering to him that he was going to have to try a little harder to if he wanted to catch Miguel's attention. Perhaps it was something about him having cut off in the middle of his sentence. Unfortunately for that little part, it was ever so quiet, and so couldn't actually commune with Apecian to tell him to clean up his speech, too. He paused to think about the question. "About six months, I think," he finally said. "I'm not sure about that, though. I can't ever remember to keep track of time, most days. But, yeah, about that long. So, where do you work?

Usually, though, Potterverse is good. It was... I think the third or fourth thing I read here? I actually tried reading on a mission until I lost a foot because I wasn't paying attention." He laughed a little at the memory. He'd barely even noticed when the parenthesis had cut it off until he'd felt it growing back.</p>

<p>((Hm. I was under the impression that it was mostly Petunia who wasn't happy she'd married James, and that was because Petunia was greener than Envy of the Giant Lizard form. <i>Is an irritating skeptic.</i> Also, since it's probably relevant, Apecian's eyes are red and have slit pupils.

I saw part of the big showdown between Van Hohenheim and Father, and because of the whole living-ish souls thing, I ended up here, 'cause my maker said that I didn't have those, just formless energy." Apecian sighed. "It's stupid, I know. Only thing I can say is that he was an idiot and I was supposed to be there so he could kill me after he failed to right after he made me. So, how 'bout you?" he asked, eager to both find out more about Miguel and draw attention away from his backstory. Why couldn't he have come from a goodfic?</p>

            <p>So, this mission was well-done. The agent interactions were interesting, we got to see some of Zeb&#39;s assertive side again, and it gave a good sense of the badness of the fic while keeping an appropriate level of quoting. I also liked the fact that they were disguised as cats (since students wouldn&#39;t work) and that there were appropriate logistical difficulties (I&#39;m now imagining two cats dragging a large-for-them bag around Hogwarts, and it looks funny in my head.)<br><br>I would complain that there wasn&#39;t much snarking in this mission (it was mainly agent interaction and &quot;ow my brain&quot;). However, the fic was bad enough (but had good enough SPaG) that it was probably hard to get many gags in (there were, however, funny bits, like the line about the spell to conjure clothes, the blanket thing in general, and the &quot;squelch&quot; thing). Additionally, Dawn pointed out this problem in universe (right at the end), so you obviously knew this was a drawback to this mission and made it clear it wasn&#39;t your fault.<br><br>Despite that small issue (which again, I can&#39;t really blame you for), the mission was readable and kept me reading all the way through. (Near the middle, I was reading mainly because I wanted to see the fic <b>die</b>, which means you did a good job of putting across how infuriating this thing must have been.)<br><br>So that&#39;s my review.<br><br>Below find my notes (in mostly chronological order) on my reactions to the mission. I&#39;m including them in the hopes they might be insightful.<br><br>- Poor Zeb. Poor Dawn. They don&#39;t seem to be in good places.<br><br>- I was almost expecting the alarm not to go off when they said what they were planning on, but I guess it happened because I expected it not to happen.<br><br>- Given the description, I&#39;m not sure i wanted to look either<br><br>- ... as cats? How&#39;re they going to take the changes? Dawn seems unusually comfortable with this, but context is telling me that she&#39;s done this sort of thing before.<br><br>- Dawn called it. Ew.<br><br>- Ok, so there are logistical difficulties involved. I shouldn&#39;t have doubted the authors. Maybe Zeb and Dawn should have gone in for bigger cats.<br><br>- I sure hope that their expectations don&#39;t match (on-screen) reality. <br><br>- Zeb (around the common room flailing bit) seems to be taking on the senior agent role a bit (or trying to). (I don&#39;t actually remember the relative seniority between the two of them, so I thought I&#39;d mention my impressions)<br><br>- Going off of the discussion leading up to the &quot;house meeting&quot;, I take back the previous comment. Zeb and Dawn are about even<br><br>- Zeb being worried about Dawn pulling a Rina. Poor guy, and entirely expected. That scene carried a good sense of everyone&#39;s emotions.<br><br>- Zeb, get yourself some sex ed. You need it. (and obligatory yay intertextuality!)<br><br>- &quot;Just don&#39;t think about it.&quot; I&#39;m trying, but it&#39;s not working! <br><br>- Man, this fic is painful just from the summaries and excerpts. How did y&#39;all actually get through it enough to mission it?<br><br>- Heh. Alex has a bet going on Zeb&#39;s CAD failures. Also, that poor machine...<br><br>- Is Dawn going to snap? Is Zeb going to ... phew, it&#39;s not happening<br><br>- Now, I&#39;m reviewing the mission, not rehashing it, but &quot;They went there.&quot; is an accurate summary of my thoughts about this.<br><br>- I take it cats have less dexterity than Luxrays?<br><br>- &quot;unable to think of anything else, including a spell that would conjure clothing&quot;. Heh.<br><br>- Impersonating Aurors was a good strategy for dealing with the rest of them. And I like the idea of the exorcism going faster once the replacement is dead<br><br>- Zeb probably thinks <i>Dawn</i> needs some sex ed.<br><br>- Dawn, don&#39;t worry. I wouldn&#39;t look at the floor either. (I liked that line)<br><br>- We don&#39;t usually see canon reasserting itself, IIRC, and it&#39;s good to see it here<br><br>- Zeb and Dawn trying to help each other out at the same tine near the end was nice. Also, Dawn called out my one complaint-shaped thing.</p>

            <p>I have a decent quantity of Fire Emblem badfic, all of which is <b>NSFW and NSFB</b>:<br><br><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/9555599">Never Too Young</a>: The pairing is Orochi/Kaden!Kana in a BDSM context. Kana is stated to be 10 in the fic and has furry traits, so it&#39;s pedophilia. Seriously, be careful.<br><br><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/6408871/chapters/14671612">Meant To Be</a>: Pairing is M!Corrin(Kamui)/Takumi, which, while possible in canon, is sibling incest. It also features cis male pregnancy, beige prose, and is filled with technical errors.<br><br><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/7942147">Dragon Heat</a>: Another M!Corrin/Takumi fic, this one involving Corrin&#39;s dragon form. Corrin also has two of a certain bit of anatomy, eash of which is stated to be larger than an archer&#39;s arm. Takumi is also highly fetishized trans male. HerrWozzeck might be doing a spork of this one, however.<br><br>I also have two fics I would prefer to handle myself, once I get permission. They are both <b>NSFW and NSFB</b>:<br><br><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/7388482">A Pair Of Dragons</a>: This is a Nowi/Nah fic, which means it&#39;s mother/daughter incest between two characters who appear underage. I intend for this to be my first mission.<br><br><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/4786193">Futanari Goddess</a>: It&#39;s F!Robin/Every female character from both Awakening and Fates, except they&#39;ve ALL been turned into heavily fetishized trans characters. That includes characters who are underage, related to Robin, or otherwise should not be paired with Robin. On top of that, there&#39;s frequent terrible anatomy, including proportions that really shouldn&#39;t be possible and vary wildly throughout the fic without any discernible explanation. The &quot;plot&quot; is complete nonsense, Robin and Corrin have both been turned into utterly uncanonical deities, and there is not a single character whose canon self could be on the same continent as their portrayal in this fic. This fic is extremely awful, and has personally offended me, so I would prefer to take it out myself. </p>

            <p>I&#39;d be willing to wager three orange gel pens (of subtly different shades you never will properly be able to distinguish) on this claim of insanity. <br><br>Given that bets aren&#39;t actually welcome gifts, have a floating jellyfish. It&#39;s friendly, I think. <br><br>Harry Potter has some really awesome fic around, some of the best, but it also has some of the worst (or the worst, depending on you ask) as well. But when you can find the good stories (which isn&#39;t that hard) they&#39;re incredible. I just love the whole series, and the fandom too.</p>

However, only two weeks into the school year, two students named Blac and Cyra disappear from Rosemari. A week later, Cyra has come back...but she&#39;s acting strangely.<br><br>Sixteen-year old Aquaria Lake is worried. After all, OOC Is Serious Business. However, she soon discovers - with help from one of her instructors, Ledor Brynn - that the person behind Cyra&#39;s strange behavior is Soleil Ashe, daughter of the late Reyman Ashe. But that&#39;s only a small bit of a truth that will shock the whole world.<br><br>Aquaria can be certain of only one thing; after this year, nothing will be the same.</p>

            <p>Well. That&#39;s proper cool, that is. I, er, I feel like squeeing and such would be a bit weird, in general, so I won&#39;t.

Well. <br>I&#39;m a bit happy about this! <br>I&#39;ll assume Alleb is, too, but we&#39;ve separated our masses and become two separate individuals, so I don&#39;t know her thoughts or anything like that. <br><br>Glad you enjoyed it!

            <p>I like the tension created by the non-linear setup, the different ways Alleb, Yocherry and the not so omniscient narrator  tell the story, their respective partners different reactions, the vivid fighting scenes and gentlepersonly conversations …<br><br>In the end, we didn&#39;t get the full story from any point of view.

            <p>Instead of just squealing at Larfen in private chat. But really, this is super funny, and made my day, and all that stuff. I don&#39;t have anything critical to say (although I may have simply used up my supply of concrit explaining to a vole I found in the Pit thereof why it&#39;s probably a Bad Idea to write a story about a seven-year old Harry Potter being &quot;rescued&quot; by an unnaturally beautiful woman who is the personification of Death and trained by demons to fight Voldemort)(I&#39;m an idealist, okay?

            <p>So, I liked it. The story was funny, the meta-humor was silly without seeming overdone, and the interlude helped me get a better sense of the characters of everyone involved. The plot made sense even with the rather non-linear layout of scenes, so you don&#39;t need to worry about that.<br><br>However, one apparent typo: &quot;‘Hey, uh, dude,’ <b>She</b> said.&quot; (shouldn&#39;t that be lowercase?).<br><br>Also, not a typo, but it took me two tries to figure out &quot;... was not on that list [paragraph break] She was. [paragraph break]&quot;, since the paragraph break there sort of threw me off and made it non-obvious what that sentence was referring to.<br><br>Other than than, good stuff. I&#39;m looking forward to more work from Larfleb (or is it Alfen?) in the future. (Are you the first geographically distributed superentity that posts on the Board? I think you might be.)</p>

            <p>First, though a description of the badfic is certainly not out of line, posting excessive detail about something designed only to cross as many bits of respect/humanity as possible is really quite unnecessary. The broad strokes would be just fine for something like this. <br><br>Second, the whole thing about the PPC is that it runs on Rule of Funny. (Okay, not exactly, but still.) Fics like this are out there, yes, and they&#39;re bad, yes, but I think the main reason this is unmissionable is that it&#39;s so egregiously bad, in so many ways, it would be difficult to make it . . . funny. Even C*l*br**n was tough to do while maintaining any humor, because, well, rape isn&#39;t funny. The Holocaust isn&#39;t funny. &quot;Hermaphrodites&quot; aren&#39;t funny – just ask my students. (Seriously, they NEVER laugh at my jokes.) Despite what Stone and Parker tell you, AIDS isn&#39;t funny either. <br><br>So this fic, I think, would be out of reach for a mission, just because I have a very hard time seeing how anyone could make it more than 20% more entertaining than the fic itself. <br><br>Obviously this is just my opinion, so if you disagree, I&#39;d actually be really interested in seeing someone explain why or how they would manage it. Because dang, if you could actually make something this tediously hateful <i>funny</i>? That&#39;s quite impressive. </p>

            <p>For, oh, probably going on a decade now there&#39;s been a tendency for many PPC writers to seek out fics that are as squicky as they can find for their missions. I wish there wasn&#39;t - I can&#39;t stand to read said missions - but whole heaps of people think they&#39;re the bees knees, so I accept that that&#39;s what the PPC wants.<br><br>And yeah, there&#39;s massive irony in the person who killed C<em>l</em>br__n saying this. But I remember how hard that missikn was, and how little I quoted in it. I want to go back and rework it, actually, if I can get into the headspace, and if I do I&#39;ll try and improve the humour. And double yeah, the irony&#39;s worse if it turns out that I partly /caused/ the trend.<br><br>So yeah. I tried to counter the trend - or provide an alternative if you prefer - with Driftwood, but ran out of energy for writing them. So it goes.<br><br>hS, not very coherent</p>

            <p>That is to say, to take something absolutely reprehensible and <i>make</i> something funny out of it. It&#39;s a longstanding tradition in my work, starting with priapic fire elementals and only getting worse from there. The whole <i>point</i> was to compare and contrast the shock humour and terrible content with the aesthetic and general zany antics of a Tex Avery cartoon. It&#39;s true of Wobbles and the Notary, and it&#39;s especially true of Doktor Trollenfisch und Gabrielle. (And I have it in writing that you think their first mission is hilarious. =] )<br><br>I must stress, I&#39;m not saying this as an attack on you; indeed, I agree in large part with what you&#39;re saying. You have to work much harder than normal to make that kind of thing funny. It&#39;s tricky. Reading it sucks. But if you stick the landing? It can <i>really</i> work. I think it&#39;s important to mention that part too. =]</p>

            <p>Somehow, I remember that conversation a bit differently, with most of the community agreeing that it was a bad idea to go after badfic that couldn&#39;t be made funny. But hey, memory is fickle and I&#39;m sure you&#39;re right. <br><br>Personally, I think seeking out squick and seeking out hate speech are different things, and judging from the anti-trans, antisemitic, anti… androgyny, I guess? Eh - it&#39;s a troll designed to make people who care about social justice angry. But, as you say, tastes differ. I wouldn&#39;t read this mission, but I&#39;m sure some folks would enjoy seeing it pulled apart. </p>

            <p>It was based on one Vocaloid song I really liked, Kagome Kagome, and it was supposed to be a horror piece. It just turned out like laughable garbage though.

            <p>A good deal of those are nowhere on the Internet, either, which is probably for the best. The first one I remember writing (which now lurks somewhere in the depths of my external hard drive) was a Neopets one about a Kougra archaeologist going to Mystery Island and (eventually) waking up the local volcano god, Potgatkerchi. (Can&#39;t believe I still remember how to spell that.) This was inspired by some flavor text on the collectible cards that I thought sounded cool. The only details I remember are that a rainbow Pteri (not a Sue; those actually exist in Neopets) and a green Minci were involved somehow and the obligatory newscast-full-of-foreshadowing was a blatant ripoff of the one from the beginning of Sorcerer&#39;s Stone.<br><br>Looking back, this probably would&#39;ve also taken several cues from the Indiana Jones movies if I&#39;d seen them at that age.</p>

            <p>I was re-reading the Original Series to help me with my own agents, when I came across the part about the various monsters Jay and Acacia fed Sues to. Since they were put off limits, at least for a time due to the volume of Sues fed to them, I wanted to give my agents somewhere they could dump bodies and execute Sues that would never get filled up, nor leave a trace. Plus, having a single site for all their missions would let me add a little bit of continuity to each story. <br><br>I found what I believe to be this ideal site in the form of the gas giant Threshold, from the Halo series. If any of you have played Halo 2, this is the location of the Heretic Gas Mine featured in the first two Arbiter levels. My idea is that my agents would visit the Gas Mine after each mission and dump the Sue bodies and any artifacts into the nigh-endless void. Plus, any corruption of canon would be taken care of by the station&#39;s destruction during the canon events of the game.  <br><br>What do you guys think? </p>

I&#39;ve read some of the missions, but I still have a lot to go, including finally finishing the original missions ^^;. I play video games (Pokemon, Megaman, and Danganronpa are some of my favorites), and I draw sometimes too. I am also a big fan of JoJo&#39;s Bizarre Adventure (though I haven&#39;t finished Part 7 yet).<br><br>I have accounts on tumblr, discord, deviantart, youtube, and reddit (where I recently posted a story on nosleep that I&#39;m actually kind of proud of), so if you wanna chat there sometime hit me up and I can tell you my usernames and such.<br><br>I look forward to getting to know some of y&#39;all, and hopefully contributing some of my own missions in the future!</p>

            <p>I see you already reached out to the community at the Discord. Good job with the social initiative!<br><br>So, I took a look at your DeviantArt, and I like what I&#39;ve seen so far. It might not be much, but it&#39;s shows promise. Nothing that can&#39;t get better with practice.(<s>And you had legitimate art classes I&#39;m so jelly</s>)<br>How often do you draw or practice? Do you have a routine or practice pointers?

            <p>Thanks! It usually takes me like a heck ton of effort to just start a conversation so I&#39;m feeling pretty confident at the moment.<br><br>I haven&#39;t really drawn much in a while, except for obligatory art class projects and the Stray Cat doodle. I&#39;ve just kind of been stuck in this rut where I can&#39;t seem to get up and draw. I know I need a looooot more practice though. I don&#39;t really have a routine, I guess.<br><br></p>

            <p>Oh man, I know how that feels. At least you got yourself interacting with the community immediately instead of bottling yourself up out of fear of messing up. The fact that you have just enough determination to jump straight into live chat with no plan is still a feat worth commending. Good job.<br><br>So, you&#39;re in a rut and need practice? If you haven&#39;t discovered this yet, may I recommend <a href="http://drawabox.com/">Draw a Box</a>? <br>Furthermore, I suggest that you try to work 10 minute practice sessions into your daily schedule. Try to find a certain time in your day that you can easily spare free time from and work on making it into a habit.<br>Of course, if you want to.</p>

            <p>Poor Alex. Very nicely paced, too. I loved the delivery of the ruby, and that short, buoyant conversation.<br><br>There was one thing that surprised me (which might just be me being behind on PPC reading): Sue-made gems are high-quality? I always got the impression that everything or nearly everything Sues created was shoddily built out of warped reality and plotholes, and most everything would collapse upon exposure to a Reality Room (except for a few useless but shiny trinkets kept as trophies, which category I suppose the Hummingbird would fall under, but I don&#39;t imagine the repurposed ruby would be more useful than an un-Sue-contaminated one. Especially given how little Suethors generally know about what makes an ideal gem). I mean, imagine if agents could wield Sue technology! Given how overpowered most of it is, it would be a strain for them to keep from becoming Sues themselves.<br><br>I also want to say that I really liked how petlike Zeke acted. He reminded me of my cat, but not to such a degree that you&#39;d written a cat rather than a fire lizard. I&#39;m wondering: do you have animals? Do you model him after one of them?<br><br>--Key</p>

            <p>I figure Sue gems are incredibly tacky, but hey, they sell pretty well in HQ, so there must be some value to them other than shininess, right? Though it could also depend on the way said gemstones are described. Agents do wield Sue technology sometimes, too, though that&#39;s usually in the context of a mission or a dismantling after said mission...<br><br>I&#39;ve had a fair number of pets in my time. A Dalmatian, three rats, two green anole lizards, a hedgehog, and two guinea pigs is the current count, though I&#39;m sadly petless at the moment. I mostly draw on the fire-lizards from <i>Dragonriders of Pern</i> to model him on, though, since that&#39;s where he&#39;s from. :)</p>

The first few stories focus on this play that supposedly drives people mad, so that seems pretty interesting.<br><br>Right now though, I&#39;m reading through page after page on TV Tropes. Hopefully soon I&#39;ll be finished!</p>

            <p>Okay I&#39;ll be more serious now. Besides a relatively small pile of Dragon Age fanfiction, I&#39;m also reading &#39;The Lost Stars: Imperfect Sword&#39; by Jack Campbell, whose books (both under Jack Campbell and John G Hemry) I would thoroughly recommend to any Sci-Fi fan. <br><br>The one thing I would say is that his writing style is quite different to most other people&#39;s I&#39;ve read is that he doesn&#39;t actually describe the physical characteristics of his main characters, we&#39;ve gone through eleven books now in &#39;The Lost Fleet&#39; and &#39;The Lost  Fleet: Beyond the Frontier&#39; and we still don&#39;t have a full description of the main character, John Geary. But then again, it&#39;s hardly felt like things like that are needed. The final thing I will say is that all the battles that occur in his books, especially the space battles feel so realistic, Campbell manages to plot out each and every battle in 4 dimensions and just makes each and every one of them work, he does it almost too well at times because I know I&#39;ve had to actually close the book and stop and work out exactly each battle is playing out. <br><br>If the title of the series starts as &#39;The Lost&#39; (or, from May onward &#39;The Genesis) then they all take part in the same universe and I&#39;d recommend reading through &#39;The Lost Fleet&#39; before reading &#39;The Lost Fleet: Beyond the Frontier&#39; or &#39;The Lost Stars&#39;, &#39;Stark&#39;s War&#39; is probably the least futuristic of all the books Campbell has written and the majority of it takes place on the Moon, whilst &#39;JAG in Space&#39; is a lot more about the day to day running of a spaceship mixed in with some really interesting legal drama. <br><br>*ahem* I think I may have got a little distracted, oh well.<br><br>Storme Hawk<br><br></p>

            <p>Finished <i>Kraken</i>, by China Mieville a week back. It was quite good - very sort of bizarre look on urban fantasy. I&#39;ll admit, it deflates a bit towards the end - the bizarreness sort of wears off slowly, and it just kind of turns into a more generic urban fantasy. A <i>good</i> one, mind you, with really interesting ideas on magic and reality and such, but it&#39;s a bit disappointing considering the start. Made me expect a bit much, perhaps. <br>It also has the first positive portrayal of a cultist character I&#39;ve ever seen! One&#39;ve the main characters, part of a cult that worships squids and such. He&#39;s entirely faithful with his beliefs, and yet is still shown as a totally reasonable, relateable person! <br>I&#39;ll appreciate him for as long as possible, considering he&#39;s also most likely the <i>last</i> positive portrayal of a cultist character I&#39;ll see, too. <br><br>I also recently got <i>The Gone-Away World</i>, by Nick Harkaway. It&#39;s a bit of a mess, as genres go, but it can be generally summarised as an absurdly comedic post-apocalypse kind of thing. Which is probably very inaccurate, anyhow. <br>I&#39;ve not even got halfway, but, I mean, it&#39;s surprised me, it really has. For all the surreal humour satirising this and that and bureaucracy and such, it&#39;s actually quite genuinely sweet at times. I note this in particular, because these kinds of stories with these kinds of humour usually sway in a more bitter, distant direction, y&#39;know? And it&#39;s damn bloody funny as bollocks, too. <br><br>Aaaand, just today, in fact, relating to a school project thing I&#39;ve got, one&#39;ve my teachers lent me a copy of <i>Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead</i>. The script. Book. Scriptbook. Dunno what that&#39;s called. <br>Only actually read a few pages into it, on account of having just gotten it, but it&#39;s bloody funny as hell, too. The very opening joke is so well delivered, and escalates perfectly. Brilliant stuff! <br>P&#39;raps I should stop being a filthy plebian animal and actually watch the play but, er. Pssssh. </p>

            <p>Your liking them is recommendation enough (and you&#39;ve mentioned so much great-sounding stuff to me that I need to start making a dent in the pile. And books are easier than TV shows or stealing my sister&#39;s Lovecraft tome). Plus, I need more touching surreal satire, because that is the life I live. Do you know cultists in real life, or are you interested in positive portrayals because it&#39;s an unusual angle, or. . .?<br><br>Actually, not <i>Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead</i>, because I&#39;ve already read it -- yes, read the script; I&#39;m extremely classy and I can get away with not having seen it onstage so worry not, young one!

            <p>I mean, I&#39;ve probably bumped into one or gotten angry at one with a loud car, at some point, but I&#39;ve not ever met a cultist or any some such. I&#39;m fascinated by that positive portrayal, because, as you said - it&#39;s a bloody unusual angle. These types of stories - and pretty much all involving cultists in general - have such a rigid archetype for cultists. Always villainous and mysterious and darkly cloaked and whatnot. And not only is this a chap who is portrayed entirely reasonably, his status as a cultist adds an entire other facet to his personality! He&#39;s driven by his faith, has a full, relateable history relating to his faith and why he has it, and you just have little moments of him praying or recalling verses or whatnot. And you can look at him and you can not only see how he became part of that cult, but you can relate entirely with it. He&#39;s a <i>human!</i><br><br>I mean, I always was one for representing characters that don&#39;t fit your standard archetypes and such, so it certainly appealed to me!<br><br>And, huzzah! I&#39;m <i>classy!</i> I have <i>class!</i> I&#39;ll celebrate this with really cheap pizza delivered to my door! And my teacher doesn&#39;t got any projects relating to it (but she <i>is</i> pretty cool,) it relates to a major work thingo I&#39;m doing. Writing a story with elements of absurdism and such. <br><br>And, you know, I actually just read that section you&#39;re referencing, today, and it <i>struck</i> me, that part. Bloody hell. </p>

            <p>As anyone in the lounge or on the wiki already knows, I just finished <i>Watership Down</i> by Richard Adams recently.  It was rather better than I was expecting.  I&#39;ve never seen the movie, but I didn&#39;t find the violence to be too overwrought in the text.  Then again, I am a zookeeper, and am used to seeing animal violence regularly, so not sure if that would bother other folks.  Either way, I found the characterization of the individual rabbits and their collective culture to a very believable representation of how a prey species might behave, which importantly helped keep the story from feeling dated, despite its age.  It was a fairly quick read, too, so I definitely recommend it to anyone who can stomach tooth-and-nail rabbit battles.<br><br>I&#39;m still in the middle of Bryce Courtenay&#39;s <i>The Power of One</i>.  I&#39;m not very far yet, but I had to watch the movie version for Senior Synthesis back in high school, so I already know most of the major points.  It&#39;s a long, sprawling story about a little British boy growing up in South Africa right at the start of World War II, his experience shaped by dealing with nationalism-based hatred from the Nazi-sympathetic Boers (local white people) while also observing how native black people are treated by both.  It&#39;s a good theme, obviously, but I have to warn for not just vulgar language, but <b>extremely</b> frequent use of the k-word.  I also don&#39;t know if any sex scenes are coming up later, since I&#39;m only up to Peekay being eleven years old.  (I don&#39;t recall any from the movie, but the movie cut stuff from the book, and I may just have forgotten any that were.)<br><br>—doctorlit is aiming for a biography on Saint Ignatius next; he likes to mix things up with a teeny dose of non-fiction, ever-so-rarely</p>

            <p>Specifically, I just brought home and began reading five books, while I was already in the middle of <i>Lord of the Rings</i> (I swear I&#39;ll finish it eventually), three essays on Virginia Woolf&#39;s <i>To the Lighthouse</i> (for school), a giant essay on Euripides&#39; <i>Medea</i> (school again), <i>Fun Home</i> by Alison Bechdel (for school and fun; I love it, and rereading <i>Crooked Kingdom</i> (the sequel to <i>Six of Crows</i>. I like it, okay?).<br><br>The library haul:<br>-<i>Making Money</i>, by Terry Prachett. I&#39;ve been excited to read Prachett, because a bunch of my friends like him, but. . . this is bad; I&#39;ll probably put it down. It&#39;s about banking. Not in a good way. I&#39;m choosing to assume his writing is hit-or-miss?<br>-<i>Siege and Storm</i>, by Leigh Bardugo. This is also bad. I&#39;m reading it because it&#39;s part of the series Leigh Bardugo wrote before <i>Six of Crows</i> and set in the same world. I want to write fanfic set in this world, and the wiki isn&#39;t well-maintained, so: melodramatic romance with a limp, uninteresting protagonist, here I come.<br>-<i>Graceling</i>, by Kristin Cashore. Haven&#39;t gotten far enough to judge yet. Haven&#39;t gotten far enough to know what it&#39;s about yet. It&#39;s been recommended to me constantly since seventh grade; it&#39;s about time I gave it a chance.<br>-<i>Flight</i>, by Sherman Alexie. This is so excellent.<br>-<i>Black Butler</i>, volume 22. Before you judge me, remember that the manga and anime are different, and I can&#39;t stand the anime.<br><br>Plus a couple of fanfic (a <i>Six of Crows</i> modern AU and some of Miss Cam&#39;s old LOTR slash), sundry webcomics, and PPC stuff as it&#39;s published (of course).<br><br>That&#39;s it for active reading; there&#39;s some other stuff I dip into now and again, though.<br><br>--Key has a problem.

            <p>I just searched up <i>Flight</i>, and it looks bloody brilliant! That sort of structure reminds me a little bit, just a touch, of Slaughterhouse 5. A bit. Just a tad.

            <p>You could say the structure is like Octavia Butler&#39;s <i>Kindred</i>. You could say it&#39;s like that book about a time-traveling cat I read when I was ten. This is not a book with an innovative structure, but it&#39;s so good. I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s spoilable, because most of it is in the character and emotional impact. . . like, the author isn&#39;t trying to surprise you with anything. Just, Sherman Alexie is a good writer and if one of his books falls under my nose (or in the vicinity thereof), I will read it.<br><br><i>Making Money</i>. . . well, it has two plots. One is a tense, thrilling tale of assassination, scheming, and corruption. It gets almost no space. The other is the story of a brilliant, successful man&#39;s idea for taking the local currency off the gold standard. No detail is spared. While I appreciate the idea, there is a reason bank fantasy novels aren&#39;t a thing. Also, I don&#39;t know. There&#39;s something irritating about the book. I might finish it just so I can put my finger on what it is.<br><br>--Key</p>

            <p>I mean, apparently it uses humour and stuff, too. And I bloody leap on that stuff like a female mosquito. And instead of laying eggs I just laugh. <br><br>Pffffft. I&#39;m sure that concept could be made interesting. It, er. Is a bloody shame, then, that it didn&#39;t! The idea of the Discworld actively going through technological and social development, as the series progressed, fascinated me. Bit of a shame that one part was buggered. <br>Do tell, if you put together what it is! <br><br>The three Discworld books I&#39;ve read are <i>The Colour of Magic</i>, <i>The Light Fantastic</i>, and <i>Men at Arms</i>, and I enjoyed the three of them thoroughly.

            <p>I wish I had time to read as many books as you. Alas, for the sake of time.<br><br>I should probably get around to reading <i>Six of Crows</i>/<i>Crooked Kingdom</i>. I read the <i>Shadow and Bone</i> trilogy, and all I remember was loving the world it was set in. I remember liking <i>Graceling</i> but that was a while back. There are too many fantasy books which I read for the base idea and worldbuilding and end up forgetting things such as characters, and plot.<br><br>The <i>Black Butler</i> manga is excellent.

            <p>Essays are being not-written as I write this. But I&#39;m slowly being sucked into <i>Siege and Storm</i>. . . it&#39;s weird, so much of the writing is pretentious and unrefined, and I go in being annoyed by every single one of the characters (except the Darkling,and that&#39;s just because he&#39;s so emphatically not Edward Cullen) and the ridiculous collect-&#39;em-all approach to monster-hunting, but after reading a couple chapters I forget all that and find myself wringing my hands with worry over the fate of Alina and Mal&#39;s relationship and daydreaming about studying Tidemaking out by the lake. Sigh. <br><br><i>Six of Crows/ Crooked Kingdom</i> has a different kind of worldbuilding from the <i>Shadow and Bone</i> trilogy. <i>Shadow and Bone</i> has a lot more development in the shiny, epic, heroic types of departments (how does the royalty live, how are battles fought,what can be done with magic, where do the monsters live, etc.), while <i>Six of Crows</i> deals mostly with the nitty-gritty, borderline-realistic issues (how do cities respond to epidemics, where does the food come from, how does the criminal justice system work, what human rights are systematically being violated, what&#39;s it like to live with a disability, etc. It&#39;s so great). So I&#39;d say if you like the worldbuilding, you should read it. It&#39;s even got conlangs! Most of which are a mangled form of Dutch!<br><br>Squee, that <i>Black Butler</i> arc is my favorite too! I remember the first time I read it, when I reaized theirship was a stand-in for the Titanic, I almost put it down, it seemed so ridiculous, but I&#39;m so glad I kept reading because, augh, that was beautiful on so many levels (I kind of want to start gushing about it now, but you know how great it is and anything else would be spoilers for the people innocently reading our conversation).<br><br>--Key does not need to calm down</p>

            <p>I&#39;m only a few chapters in, but she&#39;s very irritating. I would keep giving it a chance and hope for substantial character development, but based on what you said, I don&#39;t have a lot of hope.<br><br>I&#39;m not going to call her a Sue, but I feel like the author is using sexism in a way typical of Suethors. The main character is Extra-Special Cool for being in the army and being allowed to do important things when usually women can&#39;t, but there&#39;s no sense that this was something she had to struggle to overcome -- it just gets mentioned in passing to highlight how unique her abilities are/the importance of her job/how privileged she is as the king&#39;s niece (?). Maybe this changes later in the book. . . but all the rising action suggests that the book&#39;s focus will be on the intrigue surrounding a kidnapping and the main character&#39;s love life. I suspect it will only be ever treated as another feather in the cap of this bratty superpowered princess.<br><br>Heh, you know it&#39;s badly done when <i>I&#39;m</i> thinking it&#39;s ridiculous for having a magical power to be so painful. Magical oppression is one of my favorite tropes. And technically speaking, I can find nothing wrong with its portrayal here -- it&#39;s not like it doesn&#39;t affect her and only exists to give her a tragic backstory -- but for some reason it falls quite flat. Maybe I&#39;m just spoiled because <i>Six of Crows</i> does it so well. . .<br><br>Or maybe I just don&#39;t like this book. Maybe I just don&#39;t care about any of the characters. Yeah, that&#39;s probably it.<br><br>--Key</p>

            <p>Novel: <i>Fall of Giants</i> by Ken Follett, which came recommended to me by several people. It&#39;s not my usual fare, since it&#39;s historical fiction about the start of World War I, but it&#39;s very good. All the characters are interesting, even when they&#39;re not being particularly nice, and you get to sympathize with multiple points of view from people of various nationalities. Also, this may or may not be a selling point for you, but a surprising amount of nookie takes place. I think it&#39;s fun—it&#39;s kinda detailed, but not TOO detailed, and real people fall in love and/or have sex, so it fits in with Follett&#39;s meticulous character-writing—but nobody told me about it ahead of time, and I think it should probably be mentioned.<br><br>Fanfic: &quot;<a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10658802/1/Saving-the-Dragonborn">Saving the Dragonborn</a>&quot; by SaxyGirl - <i>Skyrim</i> - Farkas/F!Dragonborn. A light, fluffy, fun series of (mis)adventures with my favorite character and a perfectly tolerable, nay, likeable OC. Raelynn is clueless, hapless, and a little bit hopeless, but her heart&#39;s in the right place, and she&#39;s funny. ^_^ The SPaG isn&#39;t perfect and the characterization of both parties is a little inconsistent, IMO (exacerbated somewhat by the episodes being told out of chronological order), but I had fun reading the whole thing and I&#39;ll go back for more if the author updates.<br><br>(Out of curiosity, fellow <i>Dovahkiin</i>: Got a favorite twin? Farkas or Vilkas, and why?)<br><br>~Neshomeh has been on a serious <i>Skyrim</i> bender lately.</p>

            <p>Actually, a year ago tomorrow. &quot;Tomorrow&quot; being a word which here means &quot;in less than ten minutes. . . oh, look at that. I meant to say &#39;today&#39;.&quot;<br><br>Quibbles aside. I joined the PPC on February 21, 2016. When I arrived, the big news was a text game thing which turned the Board into a dungeon full of monsters, Boarder shipfics featuring corsets were being written, and hS was panicking over the low number of Boarders. Since then, I&#39;ve stopped flaking out on RPs and writing challenges (mostly. . .), doubled in squeamishness, and finally learned what a trace on an oscilloscope is. <br><br>It&#39;s been a great year. I&#39;ve met so many wonderful people, learned a lot about writing and swords, and. . . I&#39;m getting emotional. I never thought I&#39;d stick around for longer than a week, and now I&#39;ve got an app downloaded on my phone just to talk to you people. And a fellow Boarder who calls me &quot;senpai.&quot;<br><br>Anyway *toasts with ginger beer* here&#39;s to another year. Maybe by the end of the next one I&#39;ll get my Permission prompts written.<br><br>--Picture Key wrapped in scribbled outlines and character bios, hair mussed and smelling of candlewax</p>

            <p>because I just returned from my final weaponised explosive animal cartography lesson, having graduated in the art of weaponising explosive animal cartography. I have a certificate. I&#39;ve placed it over my bed. My mum squints and frowns whenever she sees it. She looks at me with lost, cold eyes, that look through me into another universe where she never had a son, and is on a beach in the Caribbean, drinking some drink that involves coconuts. <br>So if we get attacked and are lost at the same time and feel like the animal diversity in the general area is kind of low, I&#39;ve got ya. Got ya in spades. <br><br>P.S. Keeeeeeeey, believe theeeeem. Mean every single word, I do. I mean, not the dumb sarcastic ones, but the nice ones that I genuinely mean because I believe them. Because you&#39;re bloody good at things and I think you&#39;re bloody good at things. <br>And original? Clever? <i>Published?</i> RRRRRRRRRRGH, thank youuuuuuuuu. I still feel warm from having read that. Cheers, mate, cheers bloody to eternity. I* try my bloody hardest to not disappoint you, mate. <br>I mean, bugger me, Key. Honestly lost for words. Except these: give yourself more credit, oy? :) (and maybe give me a little less credit, but that doesn&#39;t sound quite as cheery, does it?)<br><br>P.P.S. Oh, I assure you, that goatee was very distinctly <i>not</i> lovely. A collective of hairs, perhaps, rather than a goatee. <br>I&#39;ll get a good one, I swear! It&#39;ll come back, twice as glorious. And I&#39;ll have to wait for it to double again, maybe double another time, for it to actually get somewhere. But somewhere it will get!<br><br><br>* I considered correcting this and adding the &#39;l&#39;s and whatnot, but I thought it would be more ironic, given the placement. It amuses me deeply. </p>

            <p>I think the chorus can probably be tweaked to fit each verse. The fun thing about a song like this is that it&#39;s almost certainly different depending on who&#39;s singing it, so there&#39;s no wrong way to do it.
