            <p>Does anyone else have opinions on what to do when we find multiple badfics by the same author at the same time, or even an author who hasn&#39;t written anything but badfic? Because I think I may know another example, but I don&#39;t want to also be seen as &quot;singling out&quot; by folks like Iximaz who (if I&#39;m interpreting this correctly) are concerned that it&#39;ll be more about the author and less about the fics if something like that happens.<br><br>-Twistey</p>

            <p>If you find yourself going through an author&#39;s profile - or worse, multiple profiles on different sites - to see how much of their stuff is bad... then you&#39;re singling out that author, whether you say you are or not. Stop and step away; we&#39;re not really the fanfiction police,and we have no obligation to list every badfic we see.<br><br>If, on the other hand, you find that three different fics you peg as bad are by the same person - maybe they&#39;re one of the only writers for a specific minor character, or they write lots of crossovers of two specific fandoms - fine.

            <p>*Picks splinters out of my id* Hmm. So if we accidentally find ourselves doing that, how do we decide which fanfics get sporked and which ones we leave alone and forget (at least until somebody possibly rediscovers them in a more ethical manner)? Do we choose the top 3 worst ones, or what? And when sporking said fics, is it okay to start on them then or would it better to wait until you&#39;ve forgotten about how much terrible fiction the author wrote?<br><br>-Twistey</p>

            <p>Is specializing in a series required, and is 100% knowledge required? There are a few series that I have some understanding of, but not thoroughly. There are a couple of badfics that I like from continua that I don&#39;t know a lot about, but that I know enough about to spork if possible.</p>

            <p>It&#39;s not necessary for your agents to specialise - they could join a <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Divisions_of_the_DMS#Freelance_Division">Freelance division</a> of their preferred department, working across multiple fandoms. (Most agents do, these days.) They could also join the <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Department_of_Floaters">Department of Floaters</a>, which doesn&#39;t specialise in anything (though that does mean you should make an effort not to turn everything into a Mary-Sue hunt).<br><br>It&#39;s not necessary for you to know everything about a canon before you write missions there - no-one does! Even Jay and Acacia made mistakes occasionally (they claim once that Legolas left Middle-earth immediately after LotR ended, for instance), and there are such things as reference materials. Heck, I&#39;ve written <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10727893/5/PPC-Driftwood">a mission</a> about a movie I&#39;m not sure I&#39;ve even seen, just by asking people who knew it and glancing at a scene on YouTube.<br><br>It&#39;s also not necessary for your <i>agents</i> to know everything. The &#39;agent is sent into canon they know nothing about&#39; plot is established enough to qualify a trope - and again, there&#39;s reference material available. It can even make it more interesting - send your agent in with a printout of the relevant fan-wiki, and see what it does to the plot! (They could drop it, complain about how incomplete it is, find it&#39;s been edited to be flat-out wrong... let the imagination run wild.)<br><br>So there you go; three answers to two questions. ^_~<br><br>hS</p>

            <p><a href="http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=176060&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=2316587">It&#39;s official: Amazon will be making a Middle-earth TV series.</a> But it&#39;s not going to be <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>; the press release is very clear that they&#39;re looking elsewhere for their stories:<br><br><i>&quot;We... are thrilled to be taking The Lord of the Rings fans on a <b>new epic journey</b> in Middle Earth.”<br><br>“We are delighted that Amazon, with its longstanding commitment to literature, is the home of the first-ever multi-season television series for The Lord of the Rings,” said Matt Galsor, a representative for the Tolkien Estate and Trust and HarperCollins. “Sharon and the team at Amazon Studios have exceptional ideas to bring to the screen <b>previously unexplored stories</b> based on J.R.R. Tolkien’s original writings.”<br><br>Set in Middle Earth, the television adaptation will explore <b>new storylines preceding</b> J.R.R. Tolkien’sThe Fellowship of the Ring.</i><br><br>(Emphasis mine.)<br><br>So what story are they planning to tell? Something that precedes the War of the Ring - if we take them at their word, something that precedes Bilbo&#39;s famous party. I have seen a comment that it &quot;must be&quot; something from Silm/UT, since the Tolkien Estate doesn&#39;t have the movie rights to Hobbit/LotR any more and therefore wouldn&#39;t have been involved, but I think that&#39;s probably wrong - the TV rights look likely to be separate to the film ones. So what <i>will</i> it be? In lieu of actual information, here are my top five guesses for what they could do.<br><br>(The honorary 6th place goes to &#39;The Hobbit&#39;, and the connected story of the Fall of Erebor. It would fit the bill, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s likely. Not so soon after the movies.)<br><br><b>5: The Silmarillion</b><br><br>To be clear: the only way Amazon have gotten hold of the Silm is by tying Christopher Tolkien to a tree and running away giggling. But it&#39;s going to be the title on everyone&#39;s lips, so I thought I&#39;d best discuss it.<br><br>The Silm would make a great &#39;Game of Elven Thrones&#39; series. You could do the Fall of the Noldor, with all that delicious infighting; or you could start at the Dagor Bragollach, and focus your series on the collapse of Beleriand. The big downside is that there&#39;s no protagonist - not unless you go super dark and make a Sons of Feanor series (yikes). The best other option would be to start <i>very</i> late - with the Battle of Unnumbered Tears. Then you can focus on the tales of Turin and Tuor, and feed into the Fall of Gondolin and Doriath.<br><br><u>Things to look out for:</u> Dark &amp; brooding Turin, cameos by Galadriel and Sauron, significantly enhanced roles for the women (which isn&#39;t a bad thing; Melian and Idril could do a <i>lot</i> in their respective stories).<br><br><u>Potential spinoff:</u> &#39;Beren and Luthien&#39; is probably the best option, if they start at the Nirnaeth. It&#39;s backstory for Elwing, and also a neatly self-contained story. Also it has its own book these days, so bonus!<br><br><u>Chance of happening:</u> Snowball in Orodruin.<br><br><b>4: The Fall of Numenor</b><br><br>This is a good one, because it ties directly into the LotR story. The One Ring, Sauron, the Nazgul - all the baddies we know and hate are around. It has Elendil and Isildur, and multiple huge battles - the capture of Sauron, the fall itself, the War of the Last Alliance. There is a <a href="http://folk.uib.no/hnohf/num-intro.htm">partial movie treatment</a> by Helge Fauskanger of Ardalambion that shows how it could look.<br><br>But... it&#39;s all from the Silm and Unfinished Tales, so see previous comments about Christopher Tolkien. I think he&#39;d be <i>more</i> likely to let go of this one, since Numenor has always stood a little apart from the main body of the legendarium. But not by much.<br><br><u>Things to look out for:</u> Pharazon&#39;s fall to the dark as an early plotline. Significant buildup of Isildur (of &quot;&#39;s Heir&quot; fame) at the expense of his family. Thranduil played as close to being Legolas as possible. Worryingly suspect interpretation of &#39;Black Numenoreans&#39;.<br><br><u>Potential spinoff:</u> &#39;Aldarion and Erendis&#39; is a Numenor story from Unfinished Tales, but it&#39;s a bit bleak. It might be better to tap into the <i>Shadow of Spinoff</i> fanbase and do the fall of Eregion, with Celebrimbor.<br><br><u>Chance of happening:</u> Roughly equal to that of a ship making it through the Shadowy Seas to Valinor.<br><br><b>3: The Rise of Rohan</b><br><br>An excellent story to tell. It uses locations we already know (Gondor, Rohan), lets you use orcs as the villains, and doesn&#39;t have too much magic to strain the budget. It&#39;s also partly from the Appendices, with the rest being in Unfinished Tales - CT&#39;s iron grip on the Silm wouldn&#39;t have to slacken an inch. And the Ride of Eorl would be fantastic.<br><br>The big problem? It&#39;s not a <i>long</i> story. Orcs attack western Gondor - Cirion the Steward calls for aid - it looks like it won&#39;t come - it comes. It would work as a standalone film or single season, not as a multi-season epic.<br><br><u>Things to look out for:</u> Eorl Lord of the Mark and Cirion Steward of Gondor as our two protagonists. Also Eorl&#39;s suspiciously Eowyn-esque female costar.<br><br><u>Potential spinoff:</u> Probably another story from the histories of Gondor and Rohan. The Kinstrife in Gondor would be good, as would the time of Helm Hammerhand in Rohan (so long as he doesn&#39;t turn into a Ringwraith...).<br><br><u>Chance of happening:</u> What&#39;s the chance of a messenger to the Mark making it both there <i>and back</i>? Roughly that.<br><br><b>2: The Strider</b><br><br>Assuming we take them at their literal word, this is the most likely option. Aragorn&#39;s youth lets you visit all the lands we already know, explore his romance with Arwen, and (since it takes place between The Hobbit and LotR) watch the buildup of Sauron&#39;s forces prior to the War of the Ring.<br><br>The big problem? There&#39;s no <i>war</i>. The Misty Mountains were cleared out by the Beornings, and Mordor and Isengard didn&#39;t march to open war until LotR. The only way you could get pitched battles is by taking the story down to Harad to fight the Corsairs of Umbar. (Or by just making stuff up, I guess...)<br><br><u>Things to look out for:</u> Cameos from young versions of <i>every</i> member of the Fellowship or other significant LotR character, except Gandalf (who will make occasional appearances as a mentor figure) and Legolas (who legions of fanwriters have shown us will be Aragorn&#39;s bestie).<br><br><u>Potential spinoff:</u> I would love to see them jump to a completely different genre and make a lighthearted comedy about Bilbo trying to raise his young cousin Frodo. Oh, the hijinks that would ensue...!<br><br><u>Chance of happening:</u> The odds of a Ranger of the North finding the right path.<br><br><b>1: The Fall of Arnor</b><br><br>This... would be perfect. I&#39;ve <a href="https://huinesoron.livejournal.com/133381.html">previously</a> written a brief treatment of how this could be made as a film trilogy (<i>Middle-earth: Fall of Kings</i>), and it would work just as well as a series - perhaps even better, as you wouldn&#39;t have to chop the story up as much to get it to fit.<br><br>It&#39;s the tale of the fall of the North Kingdom before the Witch-King of Angmar. It has romance, betrayal, politics, war, nemeses, stupid heroes and scheming villains, and even a dose of prophecy. It even has hobbits - the <i>only</i> item on this list to canonically include them. Finally, it draws exclusively on the Appendices, so no need to crack open UT.<br><br><u>Things to look out for:</u> Gandalf and Legolas cameos, along with at least one hobbit named Baggins for Gandalf to chat to. An Arvedui-Firiel-Earnil love triangle. And, for Season One only, the tragically doomed King Ondoher of Gondor and his sons.<br><br><u>Potential spinoff:</u> Anything from the Rohan section would work (or the Rohan story itself), but I&#39;d pin my money on the division of Arnor into three. It&#39;s written as fairly amicable in the books, but you could easily spin a war out of it. Alternately, the fall of Cardolan takes place a few hundred years before this time, and would be stuffed full of hobbits.<br><br><u>Chance of happening:</u> Same as the chance of a prophecy being accurate. &quot;Not by the hand of man will he fall...&quot;<br><br>So that&#39;s me, but I bet I&#39;ve missed something super obvious. So what is it?<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>It may be a lot like Attila: Total War. The Sons of FEanor were in a very good position besieging Angband. However as more of Morgoth&#39;s army are pushing out of Angband, and fertility/prosperity drops, the elves and men began to suffer and have to migrate away. Morgoth should either never leave Angband or be scripted never to die until The War of Wrath. Here, I think CA should be allowed to represent the host of Valinor as only elven troops instead of the Valar as special unkillable units. Although I would not object to see them unleash terror upon the Morgoth&#39;s forces.<br><br>Also, First Age: Total War should  not focus only as the Elves. That is why I thought there weren&#39;t as many wars in the First Age, most of it are Elves and Men vs Morgoth Country. I want to be an Easterling nation who decide to worship Eru later as Morgoth began to make more of my people as orcs instead of the enemy. Or swarthy men who decide to worship Mahal, as we gained the skill of smithing from the dwarves. Both will cause conflicts somehow, and we may have to fight to ~~gain more lands~~ allow our chosen way of life.<br><br>In short, the starting points and some events should follow the lore closely, but the details can vary wildly.</p>

            <p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/CMhr7Ho.png"><br><br>This is a rough composite of Beleriand and the lands to the east immediately prior to the Bragollach, divided into each race&#39;s &#39;natural&#39; areas. Much earlier than this, and you lose the proper placing of the Edain; any later, and you have to deal with Morgoth on the rampage.<br><br>(Minor ahistory: this map shows eastern Ard-Galen as held by Easterlings, who wouldn&#39;t appear for another 40-odd years. It also shows the Dor Firn-i-Guinar, where Beren and Luthien lived, as held by the Edain, which isn&#39;t true yet.)<br><br>I haven&#39;t bothered to fill in the region we know as Arnor; it would probably be a patchwork of kingdoms from various Mortal armies. So you&#39;d have Easterlings in the north (which would let you remove them from Ard-Galen, and remnant Edain in the southern reaches. We know that Bree and Dunland were populated by relatives of the Haladin, for instance, and we could probably slot some Hadorian relatives up in the Vales of Anduin (which I have down as Nandorian). I&#39;ve also left a few territories unclaimed and (in south Beleriand) oversized; if you want to pay me millions of pounds to complete the game, I&#39;ll be only too happy to fill them in. ^_~<br><br>You can play as any of the races, though each probably have their own advantages and disadvantages. Cirdan, for instance, would have a distinct edge in ships. The Ents are an interesting entity; I think they&#39;d have to be a weird variant game, perhaps being unable to attack except directly into a territory that invaded them. It&#39;s all theorycrafting anyway, so it&#39;s not all that important.<br><br>The game starts towards the end of the Long Peace. There&#39;s a network of fealties that makes most wars more risky than they&#39;re worth: if House Feanor attacks the Edain in Dorthonion, for instance, they are liable to be attacked by House Finarfin in retaliation (as well as the other Edain). But it&#39;s possible! Truly excellent players will be able to expand their domains even in the time of peace. Angband, however, is inviolate: you probably simply can&#39;t attack it, or if you can, it&#39;s unbeatable through weight of numbers.<br><br>After a few turns(?), Morgoth attacks. (If you&#39;re playing as Morgoth, you start with a &#39;Glaurung timer&#39; - how long until Glaurung is full-grown and you can launch your assault). He is extremely powerful, and would like to kill everything. As you say, this is going to whittle away at the Elves&#39; forces and resources.<br><br>There are &#39;story&#39; elements woven into the campaign, depending on certain triggers. If Dorthonion is taken by Morgoth while Doriath is still intact, it triggers the Quest of the Silmaril, which results in the death of certain characters (Finrod will die IF Tol Sirion is in Morgoth&#39;s hands AND Himlad has been taken by Morgoth at least once), and - a while later - the removal of the Girdle of Melian. It also triggers House Feanor&#39;s AI to start considering Kinslayings.<br><br>Some territories will gain cities only when others fall - the Havens of Sirion only get a city once the Falas is destroyed. The AI will offer and accept alliances based on various factors, as per game rules, but there are also trigger-based once - the false alliance between House Feanor and the Easterlings is probably sparked by the Feanorians beating back Morgoth, f&#39;rex.<br><br>Morgoth, as you say, is unkillable - he can only be captured, and that only by Eonwe the Herald of Manwe. Eonwe can be triggered in various ways - conquering all of Morgoth&#39;s territory obviously has to do it, as does unifying a certain (large) percentage of the world, capturing a Silmaril (various methods available) and finding a suitable messenger... you could also capture all <i>three</i> Silmarils, or organise a conference of &#39;demi-divine&#39; beings (if Melian, Treebeard, Durin, and Cirdan all occupy the same territory...). Precisely what Eonwe shows up with will depend on how he&#39;s summoned - he could arrive with the full Host of Valinor plus Vingilot, or he could show up by himself on a little boat. Then you have to have him present in a battle with Morgoth, and win...<br><br>And yes, there all sorts of possible conflict triggers. I&#39;m not sure religion is a terribly useful one (it basically comes down to &#39;respect the Valar or worship Morgoth&#39;), but you could come up with your own. Maybe Ents hate anyone who burns forest terrain. Maybe it&#39;s possible to trigger a Dwarven Civil War by allying with a nation that one of the three houses (Nogrod, Belegost, Khazad-dum) hates. Maybe sorcery is available, but every use of it sours any Good-aligned allies against you.<br><br>So yeah, it&#39;s viable. Weird, but viable.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I put my fixed defences too far from the pit, which meant they didn&#39;t really come into play; and I didn&#39;t stockpile enough food (I think the only renewable resource).

On the current sketchmap, what that would do is simple: it would send Morgoth scurrying to the ruins of Utumno, which would be far enough from Angband that no faction could physically reach both of them before the Bragollach. Unless you modded the game to change your starting locations... in which case you&#39;d end up with a Horde led by Morgoth, who can&#39;t be killed without Eonwe. So you&#39;d need to trigger one of the summoning conditions. Simples!<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>It might even be the best way to introduce the Mortal factions: they could be hordes that can ally with the factions they meet, either co-occupying their territories or becoming mercenaries (depending on game design). You could even code it so that when defeated factions horde up, they are able to merge with allied hordes - so the remnants of Doriath and Gondolin could become one people, and go take up residence in Cirdan&#39;s Havens of Sirion.<br><br>As for mercenaries - it depends on what you mean by that. In the sense of &#39;soldiers who&#39;ll fight for you if you pay the most&#39;, it&#39;s certainly viable, though it might work best if they come from one of the existing factions. So if you&#39;re friendly with the Dwarves, you can pay a Dwarven formation to act as mercenaries for you (probably appearing out of nowhere rather than stealing one of your &#39;friend&#39;s&#39; armies). If, however, you mean guerilla fighters, like Beren was - units that can infiltrate enemy territory and damage it without resorting to open battle - ... then that&#39;s also viable. ^_^ In fact, it&#39;s a repeated theme in Middle-earth history. What you would probably have is Hero units who <i>can act</i> as guerillas - at the cost of taking them away from doing other stuff. Finrod is excellent at sneaking past anything short of Sauron, but using him to do so leaves Nargothrond without its king...<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>His prologue to the <i>Beren and Luthien</i> book specifically mentions that it is &quot;(preemptively)&quot; the last book he&#39;ll be putting out based on his father&#39;s work.

            <p>It&#39;s entirely possible that CT remains the Literary Executor for Tolkien&#39;s estate; I don&#39;t know enough about the law to say whether that&#39;s likely. So he may still have a decent say in things.<br><br>According to the UK government, The Tolkien Estate Ltd currently has six officers: Cathleen Blackburn as secretary (a solicitor and the other executor), Steven Maier as solicitor, and four directors: Priscilla Tolkien (JRRT&#39;s daughter and youngest child), Simon Tolkien (CT&#39;s oldest son, the one who was briefly disowned over liking the Jackson movies), Baillie Tolkien (CT&#39;s second/current wife), Michael Tolkien (specifically the eldest son of JRRT&#39;s second son Michael).<br><br>I know Priscilla was involved in the lawsuit against Warner Brothers over online gambling, so it&#39;s possible she&#39;ll take the lead; on the other hand, she&#39;s nearly 90 herself, so perhaps not. I remember rumours from years back that <i>Adam</i> Tolkien - CT&#39;s younger son - was going to take his place after he died, but he&#39;s not on the board (and Simon is). So honestly, who knows? But it&#39;s a Tolkien, that&#39;s for sure.<br><br>The one thing this can&#39;t lead to is reboots - because the movie rights to LotR &amp; The Hobbit aren&#39;t with the Estate anyway! Warner Brothers could make as many movies out of those as they wanted. What it <i>could</i> lead to is an opening up of other areas of the canon to <s>exploitation</s> <s>housing developments</s> <s>orc-work</s> ... stuff. Yeah, I&#39;m with you on the shuddering, to be honest.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Christopher has been for Middle-earth like some people have historically seen the Permission Givers for the PPC: an implacable force bent on stopping anyone from adding <i>anything</i> to the canon except that which completely complies with our wishes. We, of course, aren&#39;t really like that (O:D), but CT was.<br><br>Now... the floodgates are opening. Who knows what&#39;s coming.<br><br>~<br><br>Sorcerers! I&#39;ve never actually had much luck with them; by the time I have the resources to buy them, my archers are usually a better option. So how can you use them to best effect?<br><br>All sorcerers come with two standard &#39;buff/debuff&#39; spells: one that strengthens your soldiers, one that slows the enemy. Then you can choose (at a cost) one of three powerful spells: one to freeze the enemy in place, one to drain their health and turn them into wights, and one to drop a rain of exploding corpses on them (Angmar is <i>metal</i>, folks).<br><br>I don&#39;t think there&#39;s all that much value in Corpse Rain.  Provided your enemy is dense enough to stay put, it can do a nice chunk of damage, but the cost of temple+sorcerer+Corpse Rain+upgrade could probably be better spent on a couple of rangers and a catapult. Yes, the sorcerer will regenerate its acolytes over time - but in that time the archers will have done even more damage.<br><br>Soul Freeze is nice; you can use it to buy time for your army to get into position, or immobilise a powerful unit you don&#39;t have the counter available for. And Well of Souls is nifty against weak enemy units - you can convert them into undead units <i>on your side</i>! But neither of them are really that powerful compared to straightforward attacking.<br><br>As for the buffs? They might be the best option. Slow the enemy cavalry to let your pikemen get in front of them; strengthen your Thrall Masters so they can hold their own against the units they&#39;re meant to counter. (My Wolf Riders always die to archers, it&#39;s embarassing.) But again: by the time you&#39;ve got a Temple of Twilight online, you shouldn&#39;t be relying on Thralls <i>anyway</i>!<br><br>So... what&#39;s to be done with them? Any ideas?<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>And not helped by the fact I can&#39;t find disks of the extension and could not play it for years (changing house several times to follow your father&#39;s jobs can play havoc with your things). But when I used Sorcerers I had indeed a preference for plain but effective buffs/debuffs, with Soul Freeze as a great way to disrupt yor enemy&#39;s battle line, and sometimes Wells of Souls.<br><br>And I think the support is worth it.

            <p>... my lackluster view of buffs is probably because the first place I encountered them and cared was <i>Age of Mythology</i>, where you get to use each God Power exactly once. Sure, it&#39;s lovely that you can turn your army&#39;s skin to bronze and be immune to damage - but when it only lasts for 30 seconds, you either have to hit something critical or bring overwhelming force anyway. Yeah, it&#39;s not something I&#39;ve ever learnt to use effectively. (Plus, y&#39;know, AI players don&#39;t really need high-level play to beat in big strategy-type games...)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Not every god power in Age of Mythology is single use.  Atlanteans who worship Gaia have multiple powers that are multiple use.

            <p>Vortex doesn&#39;t technically fit the definition of buff.  But it is a good power.  Most of Atlantis&#39; powers are solid.  I just don&#39;t like the 0 dedicated heroes.

            <p>I never had problems using them against myth creatures, and to be honest Hersirs does have a swarm aspect too in my opinion. Though I&#39;ll admit it could be influenced by the fact I mainly play Oranos, letting me with either healing from Okeanos, or the cheaper/regenerating combo of Prometheus and Hyperion. And even heroic Citizens can have a potential use.

            <p>And I <i>hate him</i>. If the Greeks are the generic nation, then Zeus is their generickest god.<br><br>I was struggling all through the first three ages, mostly because the Norse decided <i>yet again</i> to march across the entire map and harass me. At times, I&#39;ve actually had Egyptian, Norse, and Atlantean troops all in the same place, fighting each other <i>while</i> trying to knock down my walls.<br><br>The Mythic Age has been a little better. I had to use Underworld Passage to launch an attack on the Norse after they started building both a Wonder <i>and</i> a Titan Gate, but the combination of Mymidons (Zeus&#39;s special infantry) and Gold Colossi managed to bring them both down. I even got to sneak a couple of villagers through to build a fortress and harass them, putting them out of the running until I get a proper army up there.<br><br>But Egypt is still harassing me. I&#39;ve managed to bottleneck them into one location (which holds two gold deposits - I have killed <i>so many</i> labourers), but can&#39;t drive them back. I&#39;m stuck on two town centres, so I don&#39;t have the space to build a proper army. I&#39;m actually considering attacking Atlantis next - they keep running away from me, so clearly I scare them. Or perhaps I&#39;ll throw down a temple in the Norse base and start churning out Colossi to smash them... anyway, it&#39;s been a frustrating game.<br><br>As to the Chinese: I&#39;m still running on my old game CDs! Until I get tired with what&#39;s there, I see no reason to shell out for a second copy of a game that still works, and <i>Tale of the Dragon</i> only works with the Steam edition. I quite like the theory behind the Monks, though in AoE and Galactic Battlegrounds I never got much use out of conversion. More interesting is the fact that China can deploy two <i>amphibious</i> units - and followers of Shennong can deploy both. That seems like it could majorly shift the balance of islands maps away from the Norse.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Bolt is actually a pretty weak power - there&#39;s very few cases where killing /one/ unit will make a difference. It&#39;s useful very early (ie, when the enemy sends their free Classical myth unit into your defenceless base), but after that it&#39;s kind of pointless. Letting it kill the Nidhogg or the Son of Osiris gives it a chance to be very powerful - but only if you save it to the point where it&#39;s otherwise useless on the off-chance that you&#39;ll need it.<br><br>(The EE, according to the wiki, nerfed it to do 2% of the Nidhogg&#39;s health. I think we can all agree that&#39;s way too weak.)<br><br>I do intend to round out the series - but no promises on when! This game was played while Kaitlyn was working night shifts, so I had a lot of time to kill. I do quite like the Evil Gods in general, though-  they seem to be the ones who vary most from the standard mold - so it might be fairly quick.<br><br>(Atlantis led by Trump, huh?

            <p>Could be, but of course that means they&#39;d have to have the rights to even <i>more</i> of the Books. Which means they have to try and cross the bridge before Christopher smashes it with his staff (I assume Christopher Tolkien is basically Gandalf at this point, right?).<br><br>The trouble with the Rohirrim is that they... kind of don&#39;t have any stories. Eorl rides, the early Rohirrim conduct an unsuccessful ethnic purge against the Dunlendings, Helm turns into a snowman, and then eventually the War of the Ring happens. You <i>could</i> do a series about the Battles of the Fords of Isen, and the very first skirmishes with Saruman - ending with Eomer being exiled, and potentially even his hunting of a party of orcs to the borders of Fangorn - but other than that...<br><br>I think a Middle-earth adaptation that gets away from the best-loved parts could be a breath of fresh air. We&#39;ve seen time and again how Hollywood/Gameywood (that&#39;s a place, right?) deal with the Quest of Erebor and the War of the Ring, and the answer is: not well. They also suck at accurately interpreting Mordor (<i>Shadow of Whatever</i>). I wouldn&#39;t trust them to get Beleriand anything close to right, either.<br><br>But Arthedain? Numenor? Angmar? Umbar? We know so little about what those places were like. As long as they don&#39;t muck about with the broad scope of history (as Jackson&#39;s dead Nazgul did), keep the &#39;magic&#39; to what the Books discuss (as <i>Shadow of Murderdeath</i> didn&#39;t), and make an effort to remember Tolkien&#39;s overarching themes of a) the fading of the old ways and b) small things being the greatest of all (both of which would be perfectly shown by Helge&#39;s <i>Westerness</i> or my <i>Fall of Kings</i>), they can do a lot without &#39;breaking&#39; Middle-earth canon.<br><br>Though if they do any unironic &#39;we have to adopt evil weapons to defeat evil!&#39; stuff, I shall be bitterly disappointed.

            <p>Arnor and Angmar are two places I&#39;m really curious about in Middle Earth, and... Okay part of it also comes from the Battle for Middle Earth expansion with Angmar (Always thought it was a waste of not creating a proper Arnor faction for the game. Or that GW couldn&#39;t be bothered to properly supports an Arnor with more than one type of troops, or a better Angmar).<br><br>Still, Arnor and Angmar are always those two places I&#39;m looking for when I search for game mods and contents related to Lord of the Rings. I&#39;d like to see <i>quality</i> content about them. <s>Final death to the Half-Nazgul</s><br><br>(Well, that and Black Numenoreans, and just Numenor actually, but like you said, they&#39;re taking the Silmarillion over Christopher&#39;s Tolkien destroyed ghost. At a minimum. Must be one of the reasons I really like the Angmar faction in BfME, come to think of that.)</p>

            <p>I love that expansion. ^_^ I think Angmar is actually a better faction than it seems at first glance. When I play as them (single-player - I don&#39;t know if there even /is/ a functional multiplayer...), I find that once I can get a few Dark Rangers with upgraded bows, I can usually hold my own. The Thrall Masters and Sorcerers are excellent for rapid-response, too - keep a few of them hanging around, and you can beat back cavalry or infantry alike without having to wait for your counter-units to build. (They&#39;re also the best units in the game to regenerate: if you can keep the Thrall Master himself alive, you get a full army back by the next attack.)<br><br>I think Angmar is designed around early raiding: build four or so Thrall Masters and send them out to harass your enemy and keep them from getting off the ground. Then get your Rangers online as fast as you can, and use them to take out the enemy base. <i>Don&#39;t</i> get caught up in a long slog - Black Numenoreans and Snow Trolls are okay, but the other late units tend to die pretty easily. Especially Dire Wolves, for some reason.<br><br>Stepping away from the game, <i>conceptually</i> BfMEII Angmar is... dubious, but so are most of the other factions. Black Numenoreans really shouldn&#39;t be hanging about in the icy North (they were based in Umbar, down in Harad), but neither should Rivendell be fielding a massive cavalry army, or the Goblins of the Misty Mountains(?) be sending out Fire Drakes(???). (I will not hear a word said against the Dwarves, though. &quot;Let&#39;s go building what we can build... away we go, away we go...&quot;)<br><br>As for Arnor, it <i>is</i> a shame, but on the flip-side they would reasonably have the same army as Gondor. You&#39;d have to make a few modifications - take out the Rohirrim, add Hobbits - but they really shouldn&#39;t be much different from their southern cousins.<br><br>For my part, I really love the <i>names</i> in the last days of the North Kingdom. I can really get into a war between Arthedain, Cardolan, and Rhudaur; the transition from gleaming Annuminas to utilitarian Fornost is properly evocative; and if you speak a little Elvish, the fact that the last rulers of Arthedain are &#39;Last-King&#39; and &#39;Mortal Maid&#39; is incredibly tragic. It&#39;s much more exciting than Gondor squabbling with Umbar and Rhun yet again.<br><br>Plus, the whole decline of the North is a direct counter to all those fantasy kingdoms which fade away only to be revived by the hidden king (Gondor included): Arnor falls, and its successor kingdom <i>fails</i> to restore it. In fact, Arnor never does rise again - when King Elessar takes the throne, it is over a Reunited Kingdom spanning both North and South. Arnor, for all its nobility, failed.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>...In case you lot haven&#39;t been paying attention to Blizzard, StarCraft II is now free. Like, totally. Well, sort of... You actually get, by my understanding:<br><br>-The entire Wings Of Liberty campaign. That is, the original SCII campaign at launch.<br><br>-All multiplayer content. That is, free play, competitive ladder, arcade, all co-up campaigns (I think).<br><br>So if you want anything you had to buy before, or Heart of the Swarm, or Legacy of the Void - the two expansions/other campaigns - then you&#39;ll have to buy them, but if you want to get in on the RTS fun, there should be more than enough content.<br><br>Oh, and for the Windows users in the crowd, the original Starcraft and its expansion, Brood War, have been free for a while now and work fine on modern PCs. Blizzard doesn&#39;t advertise it very loudly - they&#39;re trying to sell you the remastered version, after all - but it&#39;s available in the downloads on your battle.net account if you dig a bit. So, if you want to party like it&#39;s 1998, go right ahead.<br><br>Discussion? Requests for multiplayer partners? Talking about RTS? Fun map suggestions?</p>

            <p>I laughed just about all the way through this. I love Kitty and Alec&#39;s antics, and Library&#39;s restraint and deft management of them. Too many funny moments to list them.<br><br>Also, poor, poor Alec. Possibly they should have seen the merge coming, but then again, why would they? Most people don&#39;t have that problem. (I reckon that&#39;s one more good reason to change your name if you&#39;re a recruited canon replacement.) I liked how Library dealt with it, too. I think the exorcising of PPC agents as PPC canon characters has probably been done before, but the uncertainty here made it particularly cool.<br><br>What is going to become of him?

            <p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/5eY5lD8.png"><br><br><a href="https://twitter.com/FantasticBeasts/status/931159964495708160">The reveal</a><br><br>It&#39;s a <i>Fantastic Beasts</i> film, so in keeping with my role last time... let the madcap theorising begin.<br><br>(Um, technically I guess some of this is &#39;spoilers&#39;? Look, there&#39;s a couple of new characters who we know like one thing about each, if the idea of finding that out terrifies you then stop here.)<br><br>~<br><br>H&#39;okay. From left to right, we have:<br><br>-Young Dumbledore, played by Jude Law (wutuf). Looks a bit grumpy. He&#39;s wearing what&#39;s basically a dressing gown, so points for staying on form. His wand is probably <a href="https://twitter.com/FantasticBeasts/status/930797574163873792">the black one from this tweet</a>, which is of course not the one he used in the books. ^_~<br><br>-The Fla... uh, Credence Barebone, from the first film. Looks a little less formal this time round. Also! Not dead.<br><br>-Claudia Kim&#39;s unnamed character, who is apparently a &#39;Maledictus&#39; - a were-something. Looking at that outfit, I would guess something reptillian. Also! Being of Asian descent (Ms. Kim is Korean), she could be a point of entry for some of JKR&#39;s other Wizarding Schools.<br><br>-Leta Lestrange, with her fiance...<br><br>-<s>The Eleventh Doctor</s> <s>Sherlock</s> Theseus Scamander, who... look, these two are blatantly evil, right? The spread-legs is a huge red flag, and Leta (aside from being a Lestrange) is doing the &#39;yessssss, my seductive master&#39; pose. I&#39;m not the only one seeing this, am I?<br><br>Leta is also, I think, the first blood-Lestrange seen on screen, Bellatrix being there by marriage; okay, there was also a cameo by Flashback Lestrange in HBP, but that barely counts.<br><br>-Porpentina, played by Katherine Waterston, who actually has a fantastically distinctive face that nevertheless looks completely different under different hairstyles. Weird. Anyway, she&#39;s leaning on Newt&#39;s suitcase, so they&#39;re clearly hanging out together.<br><br>-Some bloke in a naff suit. Oh, Newt, where is your fashion sense? Interestingly, in the animated version of the image, he shifts his wand to point at Jacob, or rather tucks it behind Jacob&#39;s back. Hmm.<br><br>-Jacob the <s>Muggle</s> <s>No-Maj</s> Ethnic Slur. In the animation, he looks over at Grindelwald, along with...<br><br>-Queenie, who clearly gets on very well with Jacob. I&#39;m gonna guess she&#39;s the reason he gets back into things. Hopefully his bakery doesn&#39;t get blown up. (He got a bakery, right? I didn&#39;t imagine that?)<br><br>-Gelert Grindelwald, who is frankly a mess. What did Albus see in him?! Interestingly, his wand flashes to start the animated image moving - time magic, a hint at the plot, or just graphic design? Speaking of his wand...<br><br>It&#39;s definitely <a href="https://twitter.com/FantasticBeasts/status/930797574163873792">the white(r) one here</a>, and... yep, that&#39;s the Elder Wand. Bit shinier than in the last films. I wonder about those designs on the handle... the Elder Wand seems to be of English manufacture, but that designwork puts me more in mind of the Nazca Lines than anything over here. I dunno; the design was invented before they ever heard of the Elder Wand, but it&#39;s still a possible lead...<br><br>Okay, so there&#39;s honestly not <i>much</i> to go on in one image. But it wouldn&#39;t be a <i>Fantastic Beasts</i> movie if I didn&#39;t do this.<br><br>One last thought: the title. Is that a hint that Grindelwald&#39;s crimes <i>involve</i> Fantastic Beasts? Does he have an army of monsters at any point? One wonders...<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>...just out of curiosity. Probably not anytime too soon, though, unless I run into it and am in the right mood.<br><br>And I know the movie was generally well received (I think? I wasn&#39;t paying a ton of attention, but people generally seem to be okay with it?) but so far I don&#39;t really feel like watching it. I&#39;m only vaguely curious. Like Cursed Child, right now it&#39;d basically have to blunder into my path, but even more so. (If it ever shows up on Netflix, chances I&#39;ll watch it go up, of course.

            <p>Whew, you kind of need a hat in this weather...cold and rainy. Only really fun because it&#39;s the first really cold and rainy day so far...<br><br>*sets Hat firmly on head*<br><br>Right. Let&#39;s do this!<br><br><b>Prompts:</b> So,, unlike last time I did this, I actually read the prompts first. It was a good choice--they were fun to read, and it was actually more interesting to see the bios after.<br><br>The writing is pretty great. I didn&#39;t catch any typos, and if there was any misused punctuation it didn&#39;t jump out at me. You also used a good number of betas even before hS came in--and, from what I can tell without having read the original version, you were able to take his concrit and edit well with it, which is an important skill to have.<br><br>You do sometimes use a few too many short sentences in a row, which gives a choppy feel, but it&#39;s not everywhere. Keep an eye on that, or maybe start off getting a beta who&#39;ll catch it until you&#39;re used to spotting and fixing it (or both! Both is good). One way to catch it yourself might be to read your work over aloud to get a sense of where (and how frequently) the sentences just stop.<br><br>Some quick positives! You used some descriptions and details in the second prompt that I really enjoyed. One was the description of a side of the room apparently being &quot;a swamp composed entirely of books, which seemed to have obtained their current placement when a hurricane blew through.&quot; I also liked the detail of the 80s console in addition to the RC&#39;s console, and, well, this next bit kind of speaks for itself:<br><br><i>After his tenth break along the way, he briefly considered working out how to summon some demons to do it for him. After the twelfth, he was halfway through the equations before he remembered why this was a Bad Idea.</i><br><br>Yes. Tom&#39;s home canon intrigues me; you&#39;ve also managed, between the profiles and the prompts, to give enough details about it to...well, to intrigue me. I look forward to seeing more, especially since it seems to mesh reasonably well with the PPC.<br><br>Overall, I enjoyed the prompts. They were written well, apart from the occasional abundance of short sentences and a time or two where the language was a little redundant (&quot;<i>seemingly</i> a swamp [...] which <i>seemed</i> to have obtained,&quot; funnily enough). Both should be fine if you keep an eye out for them (or your beta catches them).<br><br><b>Agents:</b> Oh man, the agents. I like them. I like their interaction, I like what I&#39;ve now learned about Tom&#39;s home canon, and I think they probably have a good chance of producing interesting missions. You&#39;ve also managed to make the prompts and the profiles jive pretty well, which is great!<br><br>A few things to point out:<br><br>-Tom &quot;has a lasting element of fear regarding any sort of demon&quot;? Setting aside the fact that I would love for him to meet a demon agent from another canon (do we have any active ones anymore?) or even just see different interpretations of them in other canons on missions, this doesn&#39;t completely come across in the second prompt. It&#39;s possible he&#39;s afraid offscreen, but when this is his reaction to finding a demon in his monitor after all...<br><br><i>Tom rolled his eyes. “There’s nothing in there. But if makes you feel better, I’ll run a scan on the thing just to make sure.” He ran his phone over the terminal.<br><br>His phone beeped.<br><br>Tom sighed. “Of course. Just my bloody luck today. Gloves?”</i><br><br>...it comes across as far more &quot;So the monitor&#39;s possessed...must be Tuesday&quot; than &quot;Aah, demon, why.&quot; Unless they come in different danger levels, you should keep an eye on that.<br><br>-Thoth himself. First of all, I absolutely love the fact that, unlike the majority of PPC agents, he&#39;s viewing access to the library as very good payment; it&#39;s a nice little twist, and the love of books/knowledge does a lot to make him fit into the PPC world. I also like what you&#39;ve done to limit him (such as his powers not always working properly). I&#39;m also a bit curious about his &#39;typically eventful&#39; past, though I suppose I could get that from a wiki. His personality overall looks interesting, though the &quot;look[ing] down on &#39;mortals&#39; just a bit&quot; is...uh, let&#39;s just say he&#39;d be able to find some fellow aliens in HQ who share that with him.<br><br>Overall this looks good. Neither agent looks overpowered, they both look interesting, and in terms of how they actually interact, well, I&#39;d read more.<br><br><b>Badfic:</b> I know pretty much nothing about Warhammer...no, that&#39;s a lie. I know absolutely nothing about Warhammer past the name and whatever I can conjecture from that. (Also, I&#39;m guessing Warhammer 40k is not the same as just plain Warhammer? Help me out here, guys.) The fic seems pretty tasteless, though--but that&#39;s all I can really say about it, beyond that at least the spelling looks alright and it is most definitely a crackfic. If anyone who knows the canon has input, go for it.<br><br>When it comes to the crossover fic...uh, good gracious golly me. Ouch. Random bandits! Violence! Gandalf rolling with it! Bad capitalization! And I&#39;m going to stop there because my storytelling sense is starting to hurt. No, I don&#39;t know what exactly that means. &quot;Odd addition&quot; is right, though. Also, I don&#39;t quite know (and refuse to go back to check) if Gandalf knew what a marine was, but if he did, he <i>shouldn&#39;t</i>. At any rate, Thorin shouldn&#39;t just be accepting it. It&#39;s bad. I look forward to the mission. I shall now go scrub my brain, thanks. (Out of curiosity, which of you first found that...uh...uh...thing?)<br><br>Suffice it to say, um, that&#39;s pretty bad, and I don&#39;t want to see that crossover fic again before it&#39;s missioned, and can I go home now? --oh wait. I am home. Pity the dog&#39;s not around to pet; perhaps I&#39;ll have some hot chocolate instead.<br><br>However, before that...a <b>Decision!</b> After all that text, it should probably come as no surprise that I&#39;m going to say <b>Permission Granted</b>. Congratulations! Here is your titanium spork; use it well, and have a Bleeproduct gift basket as well. Also, you are now a Knight of Plort. Long may you battle the forces of the Marizu and...uh...divers other foes of our fair Protectorate. Go forth (and write/celebrate/etc)!<br><br>~Zingenmir/Baron Eshakhar</p>

            <p>In the beginning, there was Warhammer. Then there was 40k. (Then there was AoS, but we&#39;re trying to keep this simple).<br><br>Warhammer Fantasy and Warhammer 40k are actually pretty different. They share a category on The Pit, but the universes, while sharing many aspects — 40k started as Warhammer IN SPAAACE — have diverged radically in tone and content. Fantasy tends to be a bit lighter in general, from what I&#39;ve heard (I&#39;m really not a WHF fan...)<br><br>Most people, at least here in &#39;Murica, tack 40k on the end of any reference to Warhammer. This is a good way to annoy Fantasy fans, especially the really old ones. After they complain, you can point out that their setting was annihilated and their game replaced by AoS. You can actually see them tense. This is great fun. Never do it.</p>

            <p>Without even clicking on the link, too.

            <p>Okay, after hS pointed out a large number of issues that I <i>really should have noticed</i> before submitting this the first time around (that&#39;s not even an exaggeration. I honestly am amazed I missed them. D&#39;oh!), I made some fairly heavy edits to that prompt to try and correct them. Generally speaking, I tried to make things clearer and easier to understand, especially to those unfamiliar with the home cannons of my characters (again, d&#39;oh!). I also tried to do more to explain Thoth&#39;s motivations in all this, and just generally have everything make more <i>sense</i>.<br><br>The actual links to the bios and prompts are unchanged, so you can find those in my original post. Don&#39;t worry, the edits are there: I checked.<br><br>Thanks to Neshomeh for acting as beta for this latest round of revisions, and for generally being Really Nice about the whole thing. Thanks to hS for posting his aforementioned (and previously seen here!) concrit, which kicked all this off, and resulted in something that I think is a lot more solid than my previous effort.</p>

            <p>I was going to say what sort of Daemon depends on what you misspelled, but... well, all misspellings are due to laziness and/or[1] apathy, to some extent.

            <p>Mostly due to tiredness; I haven&#39;t got the focus to give a proper opinion.<br><br>That said, I <i>have</i> read the prompts (and the bios, but the prompts take priority), and have a few comments:<br><br>-I actually got the first few paragraphs tangled up in my head, assuming the figure already in the RC was the Astartes (wait, is that the singular?). Might be worth glancing over to see if you could clear it up for when people don&#39;t already know that Thoth is a Space Marine.<br><br>-I feel like the sudden appearance of a <i>Chaos Space Marine</i> at your door would provoke a bit more of a reaction than a stare, a demand for his identity, and pulling a gun. Like... running and screaming? If he recognises a Thousand Son, he knows that they&#39;re all either powerful psykers or lethal automota (did I get that right?), and also that they&#39;re evil; that&#39;s not something you just point a gun at.<br><br>-Thoth&#39;s &#39;haha lol I can read your mind&#39; sounds... not at all like a Space Marine, and especially not one that&#39;s served in the armies of literal demons for ten millennia.  In fact, your whole description of him seems to come out as &#39;a Chaos Space Marine in name alone&#39;. He&#39;s not evil, he just has to look to other people to realign his moral compass. He&#39;s <i>trying to be good</i>, which... doesn&#39;t sound like a CSM? Assuming that he has some reason to work for the PPC, why isn&#39;t he just unapologetically yoinking information out of people&#39;s heads when he needs it?<br><br>I&#39;m sure you have an answer to this. But your stories - and your bios - don&#39;t even hint at it. Other than the single mindreading, Thoth could be a Roman Legionary with no changes apart from his appearance.<br><br>-It&#39;s always good to consider your audience. The only way someone can know from his introduction in the first prompt that Thoth is a Thousand Son is if they recognise his armour or the word &#39;Athanaean&#39;. The only way they can even know he&#39;s a <i>Space Marine</i> is if they recognise the word &#39;Astartes&#39;, which most people won&#39;t. You mention the Changer of Ways, but don&#39;t say anything that&#39;s obviously evil.<br><br>Put another way: the term &#39;Chaos Space Marine&#39; is a useful one for a reason. Skating around it is okay if you put something else there to convey the same impression, but non-Warhammer fans aren&#39;t going to pick up on any of what you want them to from that scene.<br><br>~<br><br>Like I say, abstaining. But I don&#39;t think Thoth sounds the least bit like a Chaos Space Marine, and I&#39;d think twice before granting Permission based on him even if I was awake enough.<br><br>hS<br><br>PS: But maybe I&#39;m wrong! Go ahead and show me how, I love being wrong. ^_^</p>

            <p>Hi hS! Thanks for the feedback. The majority of it is sensible - some revisions are definitely in order to make the fic more comprehensible.<br><br>As for why Thoth&#39;s acting the way he is... That is explicable, IMO. But I haven&#39;t made it very clear, so that&#39;s also worth fixing.</p>

            <p>Here I am asking for more advice on writing (for fan fiction this time)... and a confession.<br><br>I have lots and lots of original character ideas for various fandom, but I&#39;ve been stymied by a number of factors: <br><br>1. What kind of story to write, and whether I should start with canon characters or have an elsewhere story starring the OCs.<br>2. The bad reputation OCs tend to have thanks to bad writing (though I admit I have done some bad writing myself in the past...)<br>3. Familiarity with the canon - due to being somewhat of a slackers, I have fallen out of touch with certain canons. I would like to try and catch up though. Not helped by the fact that certain canons have different &quot;universes&quot;, for lack of a better term (ie Transformers, Sonic the Hedgehog)<br>4. Exactly how many characters to use, not helped by the number of names and concepts I have written down. (I may or may not have a bit of OCD - no pun intended).<br><br>I hope I&#39;m not coming across as needy, I just want to improve my writing skills and want to do that by writing fanfiction. I just want to get some writing tips.</p>

            <p>(Since my reply to Miah is incoherent waffling.)<br><br>1/ Write a story that explores something the canon doesn&#39;t. All my stories (try to) do this. <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9998481/1/Tenth-Walkers">What if there was a tenth member of the Fellowship?</a> <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11184632/1/Intransitives">What is it like to be a gay elf?</a> <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10368490/1/The-Horn-and-the-Harp">What if Susan Pevensie met Maglor?</a> Once you know what your &#39;What...?&#39; is, you can use that to determine whether you need a canon character or an OC.<br><br>2/ Never let yourself be scared out of writing what you want to. Persuaded out of, absolutely - if someone gives reasons why your story is a problem, be open to listening. But never be frightened, intimidated, or bullied into not writing what you want to. Don&#39;t be scared of that bad reputation - try to prove that it&#39;s wrong.<br><br>3/ Decent wikis are your friend; Wookiepedia and Memory Alpha set the standard here, I think. Reviewing the piece of the canon you&#39;re writing about is always a good idea, too. And it really helps to know someone who&#39;s familiar with it! Most geeks will be delighted to answer all your questions... at length... with diagrams...<br><br>4/ The number you need for your story. A story isn&#39;t a dumping ground for your characters; they each need a purpose. My first long story centred on a four-person team; it was only much later that I realised one of them had no reason to exist. I&#39;m still sad about writing her out. :-/<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>As someone who has way too many OCs and makes a detailed backstory for each and every one of them, I can confidently say:<br><br>1. It depends a lot. There are many combinations of roles for canons and OCs that if written well will definitely work. My fandom OC stories usually involve the OC as the protagonist and canon characters playing small side parts (not meaning that they become just the OC&#39;s sidekicks, but meaning that they rarely ever interact with the OC or even show up in the OC&#39;s life.) However, that&#39;s just what I like to do.<br><br>2. That bad reputation shouldn&#39;t stop you if you know you aren&#39;t going to do bad writing yourself. From my experience on the Internet, I have seen much fewer people with the &quot;all OCs are bad&quot; perspective than I have seen with the more reasonable variant, &quot;bad OCs are bad&quot;. If someone doesn&#39;t like OCs and attacks you for writing with them, that&#39;s not your problem, and indeed, it&#39;s one of the few situations in which the phrase &quot;don&#39;t like it don&#39;t read it&quot; actually applies.<br><br>3. Wikis and guides are your friend. So are fandom-specific cliche lists and &quot;Is your [fandom] OC a Mary Sue?&quot; tests that you can find on Wattpad and Quotev. So is Google image searching about &quot;[fandom] Mary Sue&quot; or &quot;[fandom] bad OC&quot; or just &quot;[fandom] OC&quot;. That latter source isn&#39;t really quite as good as the other stuff, but I use it to supplement the knowledge I gain from those other sources. It&#39;s also good to have a wiki by your side even if you think you know what you&#39;re doing, because otherwise you might screw something up like, for example, combining all the locations in Wolfenstein 3D and Spear of Destiny to make one generic &quot;Castle Wolfenstein.&quot; *bangs head on keyboard repeatedly because I need to rid my OC&#39;s backstory of this mistake*<br><br>4. Well, by all means write multiple fics if there are too many to put into one, or if there are some who just don&#39;t fit into one fic. If your OCs can be grouped together somehow (friend groups, teams, etc), then by all means write something about each group and each remaining OC. Or you could break down the general timeline of a huge group and write fanfics about each part of it, focusing on whichever characters are most relevant to the event each time.<br><br>Springhole.net has a good amount of pages dealing with OC creation and fanfiction (link below my signature), so I suggest you check those out for more info.<br><br>-Twistey<br>----<br><a href="http://www.springhole.net/writing/ocs-fan-characters-and-fandom.htm"><a href="http://www.springhole.net/writing/ocs-fan-characters-and-fandom.htm">http://www.springhole.net/writing/ocs-fan-characters-and-fandom.htm</a></a></p>

            <p>Firstly, you need to know the canon pretty well. You don&#39;t need perfect knowledge, but you have to know everything pertinant to what you&#39;re writing. You should be familiar with the source material, although I wouldn&#39;t say you necessarily have to read all of it, depending on how much it is. You don&#39;t have to read every SWEU novel before writing any SW fic, for example. And if your fandom has a well-cited and maintained wiki, USE IT!<br><br>As for using OCs... Well, I am primarily in the 40k fandom, and OCs are the rule there, not the exception. You are expected to write stories about your OCs, and come up with tales and backstories for all of them. I don&#39;t know a single player who hasn&#39;t given at least their HQ choice a name and backstory, if not all their other characters. Some of them have even written fairly long stories about them.<br><br>Anyways, there&#39;s a lot of great fanfiction in that fandom that has nothing to do with canon characters at all. Heck, in most of the very best ones, canon characters take on a relatively minor role. But that&#39;s how that universe works: Warhammer is very much about Your Dudes and Your Stories, and it&#39;s as much about AARs and what happened at the gaming table as it is about what was written in any book.<br><br>Given that background, I&#39;m as interested in the well-written adventures of an OC as any canon character. I&#39;m also partial to a good &quot;day in the life&quot; fic: stories about characters who aren&#39;t big heroes or amazing, high-powered awesome people, but just more-or-less normal people living in whatever world.</p>

            <p>The usage of OCs, for me as a reader, has to maintain the canon characters central role. This does not mean they have to be limited. It doesn&#39;t mean the canons must carry the POV. One of my all-time favorite fanfic writers uses many, many OCs and they usually carry the POV. The stories always tell a story that not only introduces the OC, but also moves the narrative of the OC forward.<br><br>The catch is that it is always a tale of &#39;how the canon characters intersected my life.&#39; The canons, when they do appear on-screen, are always suberbly in-character, which helps as well. The stories also tell a story about the canons that deepens or moves them, too.<br><br>I do believe you need to know a canon very well before writing in it. How else can you get the voices and backstories and fan-picky details right? I&#39;m passionate about my fandoms. I notice when someone doesn&#39;t know them well, but wrote anyway. If it is a messy canon (Marvel, anyone?), then putting the story into context of a particular universe and only knowing it is valid. I love Hawkeye, but so many backstories...<br><br>Does that help any? <br><br>Do you want a link to that author? I read her LOTR and Stargate fics, but she has some other fandoms, too. I do think she has the best usage of OCs I&#39;ve ever seen.</p>

            <p>Sometimes, the setting itself is enough of a &#39;canon character&#39; to take the central role. Middle-earth is the obvious one (for me) - you can pick any time and place in Middle-earth&#39;s history and reconstruct enough of the culture there to make a compelling backdrop for a story. I have <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11184632/1/Intransitives">a series of five vignettes</a> set in various places around Middle-earth, and the only canon <i>character</i> who appears is an Ent who was namedropped by Treebeard once. Do the stories suffer, just because I didn&#39;t force my two dwarven lesbians to hang out with Thorin or Gimli? Does the tale of a disabled Hobbit need Merry and Pippin to play with him and show that he, too, is a person? Not in the least. They are characters in their world, and that is all they need to be.<br><br>Similarly, I could imagine writing a murder mystery set on Qo&#39;noS, starring only Klingons, in which canon characters were mentioned (it&#39;d be hard to not namedrop Kahless the Unforgettable) but didn&#39;t appear. Klingon culture is fleshed-out enough for that. You couldn&#39;t do the same thing even on Tatooine - the GFFA&#39;s #1 filming destination, apparently - because all the culture is either generic or centred on canon characters. (Yes, you could write about how terrible it is to be a slave, but you could set that in America and not change much.) But you could write about living in Jabba&#39;s Palace, for instance, where the canon character is - as Miah says - central even when he&#39;s not around.<br><br>The flip flip side of this is that you have to make your readers want to stick with the story. A Percy Jacksonverse story about your OC Ariadne O&#39;Shea and her quest for the wreck of the Argo is all very well, but unless Ariadne is interesting enough to pay attention to, people are going to head down to the Percy/Annabeth fluff underneath. Fanfic readers are there because they like the <i>canon</i>, so you need to use enough of the canon to keep them there.<br><br>My goal with fanfic is to explore unexplored angles. So in the above example, you could find some gods who Riordan hasn&#39;t covered (though good luck!), or draw on a myth he hasn&#39;t touched. If, though, your story is &#39;they go through the Labyrinth and run into traps, then Hades tries to trick them, and then they fight a cyclops&#39;... then you&#39;re not doing anything new, and why does anyone want to read? Only if Ariadne has a <i>really</i> good hook to draw them in...<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>That was good. And yeah, I see what you mean - but I feel that you could also have a good story in pieces of Middle-earth that have no connection to the canon characters. It would be interesting to read about the division of Arnor, even though the last king of Arnor and the first of Arthedain are nothing more than names on a timeline.<br><br>I suppose you could argue that they&#39;re still connected because they&#39;re part of the link between Isildur and Aragorn, but by that milestick, any dwarf is &#39;connected&#39; to Thorin by virtue of shedding more light on his culture.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>(I&#39;ve now read the sword one too; my poor heart, it did break.)<br><br>Let&#39;s take as a hypothetical example the Marvel Cinematic Universe (movies only). It&#39;s a great canon, very fleshed out and mostly consistent - but is there space for an OC not connected in some way to the main characters? I think it would be hard to find somewhere for them to go, because most of what makes things interesting <i>is</i> the characters.<br><br>To show what I mean, here&#39;s a few hypothetical stories you <i>could</i> tell... and why you probably shouldn&#39;t:<br><br>-Your hero lives in a city on the US West Coast, and fights supercriminals. Great - but why is it fanfic? Superpowers are so generic that you may as well make it original fiction. (Exception: if they&#39;re using something connected to one of the main characters - salvaged Iron Man tech, say - then they become an exploration of that connection, and not independent at all.)<br><br>-Your OC lives in Vanaheim, and you write a lovely story about her life there. Um... see previous point! &#39;Idyllic world being attacked&#39; isn&#39;t specific enough that you need to make a fanfic, unless you have characters you want to draw in.<br><br>-Your OC is a previous Sorcerer Supreme. Yeah, you could write that. But then you&#39;re defining them as &#39;predecessor to Strange and the Ancient One&#39;, which is a very firm connection.<br><br>And so on. The thing that makes the MCU interesting is the existence of the Avengers and their ilk, not the wider setting. The planets and politics only exist to be a backdrop to their adventures, so writing without tethering the narrative to them isn&#39;t usually worthwhile. Contrast Middle-earth or Warhammer 40K, where the <i>setting</i> came first, and was used to build the narrative - <i>Lord of the Rings</i> was literally Tolkien coming up with a story to set in his previous world!<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>The reason that story would be interesting isn&#39;t because of the inherent interest in New York - it&#39;s because the Avengers fought Loki there, and a giant portal disgorged aliens from the sky. Your hypothetical story would be a drawn-out reaction to those events - events which are caused by and played out by the big-name canon characters.<br><br>(Also this is... pretty much the backstory of one of the later MCU villains.

            <h1>They always try to teach the wrong lessons...# No.<br><br>The trouble with films is they have almost no background detail. You name Xandar, but what do we know about Xandar? It has space police. It used to have a war. It looks fairly nice. You could write a story there - but you&#39;d have to either make it a reaction to the events of the films, or straight-up invent a society.<br><br>Or take from the comics, of course, which have the advantage of very long runs to build the background in.

            <p>Funnily enough, there actually was a West Coast Avengers team in the 1980&#39;s. Hawkeye was the leader, at least for a while. I haven&#39;t gotten to read them yet, just summaries, but I will someday. </p>

            <p>What immediately comes to mind is to take a look at the canon that you&#39;re going to be working with. Get a grasp of how everything works, then find out more about the thing you plan on writing about. If your OC has a certain power, for example, you should look at other characters&#39; powers, how they got them, and if your character&#39;s power could work.<br><br>Don&#39;t let your OC replace a canon character. There was some of this in the Original Series where the author would kill off a canon character and have their OC take their place.You should also get to know how the canon characters act so you can portray them accurately. The way I think about it, good fan fiction is the kind of story you could read to a character in the canon in question, and they would believe it.<br><br>If you&#39;re just starting off, you&#39;re probably going to have an easier time writing for one OC per story. It&#39;s better to have one well-rounded character than several flat ones. And just a suggestion for the plot, I&#39;d recommend something simple that would take place between time skips, or perhaps after the story has ended. You&#39;ll probably have an easier time saying &quot;This happened sometime between Book 1 and Book 2&quot; than if you were to narrow it down to &quot;This happens during this specific battle scene.&quot; You&#39;ll have more flexibility and you won&#39;t need to worry about little details. <br><br>I hope this helps!</p>
