            <p>Happy New Year, PPC!<br>Sorry to put two posts on the front page, but I just finished reading an awesome fic, so in the spirit of ringing in the New Year well, why not start a goodfic thread?<br><br>Here&#39;s the fic:<a href="http://www.fimfiction.net/story/130204/courage"><i>Courage</i> by Scion</a><br><br><i>Loyalty; Generosity; Laughter; Honesty; Kindness; Magic;<br>These are the pillars upon which Equestrian society stands. Upon these principles, Harmony is maintained, and civilization flourishes.<br><br>But there are other magics in this world. Intelligent life requires three things:<br>Wisdom, to decide upon an action.<br>Courage, to go through with the action.<br>Power, to carry out the action.<br><br>An individual with Wisdom, Courage, and Power... can change the world.<br><br><b>Evil unlike any Equestria has ever seen has come to the Everfree, and through proximity, Ponyville. The Mane 6 must attempt to overcome the darkness they are faced with; it will not be easy.<br><br>But they will not face such evil alone.<br><br>The Hero has come.<br><br>A Legend of Zelda Twilight Princess and MLP crossover.</b></i><br><br>Exactly what it says on the tin. This story treats Equestria as an extra Twilight Princess province, which Link accesses via a portal in the Everfree. I could sing its praises, but someone else in the comments said all that is needed to be said. I&#39;ll repost the relevant non-spoilery bits here:<br><br><i>&quot;This story is easily my favorite Legend of Zelda crossover on the sight (though I admittedly haven&#39;t read many) and one of my favorite crossovers over all.<br><br>The big thing that you did right, that I have seen a-lot of people fail on especially in more action oriented stories such as this one, is a loss of agency on one side of the crossover or the other. To many times it feels like one side of the story has all of the answers and does all of the work to save the day. This never happened here.<br><br>...<br><br>The presentation of Equestria as a separate area to explore akin to those already in the game was well done via the access through the forests near Ordon, bringing to mind for me at least how Link got to Termina in Majora&#39;s Mask.<br><br>...<br><br>Moving on to the characters. Dear god the characters. You got the characterization of everyone spot on. Even the background ponies and the diamond dogs felt fleshed out. And then there was Epona. Wow was that awesome.&quot;</i><br><br>So if you&#39;re a fan of Zelda or MLP (or both), give it a read!</p>

            <p>But I&#39;m afraid I still don&#39;t get it. Apparently we start with a nightmare about Ajax and Levy&#39;s last mission, and <i>a hundred eyes standing</i> refers to the Argus replacement, but I wouldn&#39;t even get this if I hadn&#39;t read Ajax&#39;s biography on the Wiki.<br><br>Ajax receives a message. Since he already joined Mathew, the message can&#39;t say that Levy woke up from her coma, and it can&#39;t be a message from Levy saying that she&#39;ll move to Floaters (or this interlude doesn&#39;t match the bio); I wonder what it actually says.<br><br>I guess that Ajax&#39;s memories while he goes to visit his friend in Medical appear incoherent to show a specific state of mind. So we get a continuation of the nightmare, where Levy escapes to medical, but then we get a flashback to events before the events of the nightmare? <br><i>An arrow grazed the girl’s cheek, followed by another feminine form flying over the Eyes. The boy then slammed into the Eyes, dropping a smartphone-like device in front of the girl.</i><br>Capitalizing <i>the Eyes</i> may work, because they are a stand-in for Argus, but why didn&#39;t you do this from the beginning? Just to confuse me?<br>Who is <i>another feminine form</i>? The Sue? Judging from the flashback below, wasn&#39;t the Sue chained to the bed when they charged her before the Argus replacement hurt Levy? So who shot the arrow? The Argus replacement?<br><br><i>The <b>screamed</b> occurred along side the sound of glass shattering. Wings appeared on the girl&#39;s back, and once blonde hair returned to blue. The eyes, not missing a beat, grabbed the wings.</i><br>Should be &quot;scream&quot;, and we are back to non-capitalized <i>eyes</i>.<br><br>Then we are back from the flashback and in Medical, where Doctor Appleby may just have introduced himself and now shouts for a Defibrillator, and a <i> draconian humanoid rushed through the still open portal</i> into Medical? Or to the place in the badfic, where Ajax still is? I&#39;m not quite sure about this. <br><br>And we&#39;re definitely back to the badfic, where Ajax has just killed the Argus replacement (while Levy escaped to Medical?) and now wants to kill the Sue, too. But his leg is hurt, and the Sue is advancing onto him (wait, wasn&#39;t she chained to the bed?), and there&#39;s the <i>draconian humanoid</i> again.<br><i>&quot;Get to the portal,&quot; the spectacled Dragonborn said. &quot;She’s okay, just get going.&quot;</i><br>I&#39;m lost. Did the Dragonborn go from Medical to the badfic to tell Ajax that Levy is okay? Who is he? DIA – Special Response?  <br><br><i>Ajax dispersed his scythe, and hightailed it back to the motel room <b>they found</b> the Sue in.</i><br>You may have meant to say &quot;they had found&quot; (past perfect) or I may be getting this totally wrong. Anyway, I&#39;m lost. Are there two portals, one the Dragonborn just came through and another in the motel room (where the Sue should have been chained to the bed, or is this bed elsewhere?), and why must Ajax go to the motel? Can&#39;t he use the portal that&#39;s apparently right there? <br><br>In the final memory, Ajax arrives at Medical, and obviously Levy isn&#39;t okay, and apparently Ajax didn&#39;t kill the Sue, so his bio is a lie?<br><br>But I don&#39;t actually need to know what exactly happened on that mission to relate to the characters and feel their pain.<br><br>HG</p>

            <p>I don&#39;t see how you could think that Levy was still in a Coma. She did, in fact, cameo at the end of my first mission. Levy finished her physical therapy and Ajax is coming over to help her move, with Matthew having been Shanghaied in to assist<br><br>The chains were under Levy&#39;s control, they dispersed when she was knocked out. And if it was Ajax using his Hypnos Letter, it would&#39;ve worn off in the fight with Argus.<br><br>The Draconian humanoid is Nickul, he was part of the last PPC Hunger Games and is to be Levy&#39;s partner. Nickul, being a rather intelligent D&amp;D!Dragonborn realized that agents usually don&#39;t solo missions, and went in to check if there were anybody on the other side. As for why he was there... Optometrist appointment.<br><br>There was a single portal. Nickul went through the one in the Motel room and ran to join the fight. It&#39;s not like he materialized out of nowhere.<br><br>As for the consistency issues with the what&#39;s given? Yeah I decided to rework some of that. The first version of this interlude was much more in line with what was in the Bios, but it was a bit too squicky for my taste<br><br>Hope that cleared things up for you! -Mattman</p>

            <p>Well, here goes nothing. Hello whoever may be reading this, my name is Tyler. Yes, that is all you get for my name. I would like to say that I am so sorry if I&#39;m doing anything wrong and for how dumb this thing sounds at times. <br><br>The idea seed to (or at least try to) join the PPC was planted in my head by my moirail and/or bestfriend Calliope. After I was linked many things and mostly educated about the PPC, I found myself here. Writing like I&#39;m the worst writer in the entire universe.<br><br>It so happens to be that I am in many fandoms but some of the more prominent ones that are more popular are Homestuck, Gravity Falls, Steven Universe, Over The Garden Wall, Supernatural, and Doctor Who (not a lot but I&#39;m still getting into it.) Youtube is a big part of my life. I watch Youtubers like Filthy Frank, Idubbbz, Maxmoefoe, Pewdiepie, CrankGameplays, Danisnotonfire, and Amazingphil. I also band fandom with bands like Twenty One Pilots, Panic! At The Disco, Fall Out Boy, My Chemical Romance, and a lot more that I just can&#39;t think of.<br><br>Some of the things I do for entertainment are:<br>Drawing<br>Listening to music<br>Reading<br>Pacing outside when it&#39;s cold, dark, and rainy<br>Pacing inside in a dark room when it&#39;s &quot;nice&quot; outside<br>Pacing in general<br>Talking and arguing with myself<br>Binge watching Youtube videos<br>Sleeping<br>and that&#39;s it because I&#39;m boring.<br><br>I&#39;m on the interwebs as much as I can so I&#39;ll probably will be on here a lot, but I&#39;m shy and socially awkward so I probably won&#39;t engage many people on my own.<br><br>On that note, I&#39;m going to stop while I am ahead. Thanks for reading this crap, and I hope whoever you are that you have a great day. Bye!</p>

            <p>I&#39;m so happy to see you here, Tyler! I feel like I&#39;m a good recruiter... an unofficial one. (Now all we need is Tuna and the trio of whatever-we-are will be complete... muahaha.)<br><br>Anyways! Your intro was fine, luv. As my moirail, you get more than just my standard Newbie Gift.<br><br>As the standard, I present you with a full set of D&amp;D dice - perhaps they&#39;re patterned like your space dice, or Lore&#39;s scarab set, or my bubblegum-and-death ones. Who knows? You know. (I don&#39;t think I need to remind you of the shapes, do I? I&#39;m doing it anyways. One d3, one d6, one d8, two d10s, a d12, and a d20.)<br><br>And the Special Moirail Gift (that my brother got none of): I hereby present you with a large statue of the Triforce - but with familiar faces on the golden triangles. On the top is mine, which you and Tuna totally set up with that cult-coronation-and-declaration; the right triangle is yours; and, of course, the remaining face belongs to Tuna.<br><br>Cheers, luv! &lt;</p>

            <p>I kind of had the same reaction, which I think has less to do with LJ itself, and more to do with my heavily associating it with teenagerhood.  It makes more sense that it would&#39;ve stuck around, considering it was a pretty heavily-used platform when many of us drifted away. </p>

            <p>(Also, fellow Das Sporking reader! Hi!)<br><br>Since a nice chunk of my PPC stuff, as well as what&#39;s up of the Deleterius material I&#39;d been archiving, is on LJ because I was feeling nostalgic when I chose my posting method 4-ish years ago, I&#39;m now in the process of moving to Dreamwidth. Their most recent news post actually addresses the LJ thing, the site seems pretty easy to use so far, and I read through their mission statement, etc and Terms of Service and Privacy Policy, and while I could certainly be missing something, all of it places them in a pretty good light. Also? It uses very similar code to LJ and apparently has no ads or something like that. I know some people here have been using it for a lot longer than an hour or two, so I&#39;ll leave it to them to provide more about their experience if they want to. <br><br>The move over, I can tell you, is extremely easy, because you can import pretty much everything. Including comments, tags, and profile data. The only downside is that your request gets placed in a queue, so moving some things (entries and the attached comments for me) can take hours or, apparently, up to a day. I haven&#39;t checked this morning whether it&#39;s done yet, but I can say that everything else I imported came over very smoothly. So that, and the somewhat cleaner UI, are already points in Dreamwidth&#39;s favor. <br><br>Anyway. That&#39;s my two cents: it looks good, and moving over from LJ (oh, you can also move a community if you want to, and it works the same way) is pretty easy, if potentially time consuming. I&#39;ll be updating my links once I&#39;ve got everything set up. <br><br>~DF</p>

            <p>So we now have both PPC communities up and running on DW: <a href="http://the-ppc.dreamwidth.org/profile">the<em>ppc</a> for Boarders, and <a href="http://ppchq.dreamwidth.org/profile">ppchq</a> for the agents (and RPing as them).<br><br>In the old days the</em>ppc was fairly quiet; as its profile says, it exists mainly to collect PPCers&#39; personal LJs. We would then friend the people we liked, and read their posts on our friends&#39; pages. I&#39;m not sure quite how that carries over to DW - anyone?<br><br>ppchq sort of split the difference between that and a community for posting in. It had its share of posts, but it was also a hub for RPing journals (like <a href="http://agent-dafydd.livejournal.com/">Dafydd&#39;s</a>).<br><br>I... would really like to see all that reappear. I think slow-motion pointless RPs in ppchq are worth having; I think in-character journals are even more so, because they&#39;re a window on the agents without having to be formal stories or time-consuming RPs; and I would really, really like to see personal journals over on the_ppc make a comeback. The PPC-on-LJ was an amazing community, and having that back would be amazing.<br><br>I also want people&#39;s opinions on mirroring the personal side between DW and LJ. If you&#39;re a DW user, you can set up a basic LJ account and have your posts automatically mirror, without giving the Russians anything except server strain. The reason I&#39;d like this is that I still have friends on LJ - even after all these years! - and would like to think we can hold a community intact across two journals. I&#39;ll be cross-posting everything in <a href="http://huinesoron.livejournal.com/">my</a> <a href="https://huinesoron.dreamwidth.org/">journals</a> regardless of what everyone else does.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>However I&#39;m not sure quite what to do with my missions still on there. I haven&#39;t written any for quite some time and it is likely I will not write any more soon - if ever - and I do not use my LJ account for anything else. However, people may want to read the adventures of Cyba and Eagrus and it would be a shame to lose records of their escapades - particularly as they are in a less common department and have entered some less common continua. Most notably I believe the continuum they encountered during the Blackout remains unique in PPC history.<br><br>I would prefer to delete my LJ but perhaps the missions could be moved to the PPC archive or some such?</p>

            <p>The only change they&#39;ve carried out is to move their servers. By all means remove any personal information on there, but other than that...<br><br>The easiest way to archive your LJ is to import it wholesale to Dreamwidth. Simply set up a Dreamwidth account, then on the &#39;Organise&#39; menu go to &#39;Import Content&#39;. Feed it your LJ username and password, and it will cheerfully import everything for you. Then join the_ppc community (for ease of finding), and forgot all about it.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Also, this is great. Yay archiving! <br><br>Speaking of which, I&#39;m going to try making a separate journal for the Deleterius stuff. I&#39;d been thinking about it before, and now seems like a good time.  I&#39;m just wondering whether I&#39;d need to do another import or if I can move them directly from my personal Dreamwidth journal... It might be less frustrating to just copy and paste, if it comes down to that.<br><br>I&#39;m also very open to getting some help with putting up the material I was sent. It&#39;s been slow going, since, uh, full-time student who was doing two degrees until this summer.

            <p>...that all you need is <s>love</s> the username and password. I don&#39;t have a comm to try moving, but the FAQ said it works the same way as moving a journal. If hS has the password, it should be doable. Might take a bit of time for everything to transfer once you&#39;ve requested it--my posts aren&#39;t there yet and it&#39;s been maybe eight hours or so--but it does move pretty much everything, and you don&#39;t have to babysit it or do more than choose what you want imported and click okay at the beginning. It also shows you the queue; for reference, I&#39;m moving 20 posts and 7 comments, and when I requested it the queue was at 118 posts and 2 comments. Everything else was at 0, and so my tags and so on transferred in about two seconds. It&#39;s fast once it gets to you. <br><br>Anyway. It&#39;s easy, and sounds worth it, as well as doable, if hS has the password. <br><br>~DF</p>

            <p>Increased traffic and so on. <br><br>An interesting thing to do is to search &#39;PPC&#39; under &#39;interest&#39;. There are... I&#39;m going to estimate about eight results, from what I remember. No clue how many of them are currently in use--I didn&#39;t look too closely at the names except to notice that Kippur is the first result and Lily Winterwood is on there--but it&#39;s cool to be reminded that there are other Boarders on there already. <br><br>And why yes, yes you do rather need a Dreamwidth account to import content to :) It tends to help. <br><br>~DF</p>

            <p>There&#39;s a really easy way that anyone can help. If you have a few minutes, take a look at <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/The_Complete_List_of_PPC_Fiction">the Complete List of PPC Fiction</a> and scan over a section for LiveJournal links. You can also look <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/index.php?title=Special%3ALinkSearch&amp;target=%5C*.livejournal.com">here</a> (I think, assuming anyone can use the external links search) for more obscure links. Then go to <a href="http://archive.is/">Archive.is</a> and check to see whether its PPC content is saved (lower text bar). If so, great! If not, enter a post&#39;s URL in the upper text bar to back it up.<br><br>When checking for saved posts, make sure to put an asterisk at the end of the URL (e.g. <a href="http://firebird766.livejournal.com"><a href="http://firebird766.livejournal.com">http://firebird766.livejournal.com</a></a>* ) to make sure the archive looks for all URLs starting with that prefix, and not that specific URL only. Otherwise you&#39;ll miss things.<br><br>A note: It&#39;s probably a good idea to <i>only</i> back up PPC stuff. People put personal stuff on their journals, too, and that&#39;s no business of ours. Be considerate, and don&#39;t just blanket-save the whole journal, even if it means putting in a bit more time looking for PPC tags and whatnot.<br><br>A lot of this has actually been done already, which is awesome, but it doesn&#39;t hurt to check again. {= )<br><br>The PPC Archivists&#39; Society thanks you for your contribution!<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>(Because, seriously, that&#39;d just be messy. Or maybe it wouldn&#39;t. No, it probably would. I&#39;ll leave it for now, anyway.)<br><br>So! Hi. You know me (or may have seen me around) as DawnFire. As of...about ten days from now, I&#39;ll have been a Boarder for four (4!) years. And I&#39;ve been using this screen name since I was fourteen (though I came up with the name earlier) and, well, I&#39;ve been feeling for maybe a year on and off that it no longer suits me. And now... I&#39;ve finally come up with an alternative. *evil laughter*<br><br>...okay, scratch the evil laughter. It&#39;s just making me think that my fourteen-year-old self would&#39;ve actually written &quot;mwahahahahaha!!&quot; or something. (I was Dark Side. We had brownies. It was a thing. Some of you probably remember it, actually. Any Light Siders here? Chocolate chip cookies? Share your stories! After all, this post is turning into a trip down memory lane before continuing forward.)<br><br><u>The names:</u><br><br><b>DawnFire</b> comes from the Warriors series (the one about cats) by Erin Hunter (a pen name for three women in combination, unless there are more or fewer of them now. The series is still ongoing, but I stopped reading it a while ago). One day, my friend and I--she was also into the series--made up two names: Brightshadow and Dawnfire. She was actually Dawnfire. In the end, I&#39;ve used both names online, with Fire capitalized because I liked the way it looked <s>and because it stands out. Turns out there are a lot of Dawnfires out there</s>.<br><br><b>Zingenmir</b> brings the list of Yiddish Boarder names up to two, if I&#39;m not mistaken (the other is Neshomeh). It literally means &#39;we sing&#39;, or &#39;we are singing&#39;; I&#39;ve been doing a lot of singing these past few years, especially in Yiddish (with which I&#39;ve also been otherwise involved since starting university). It has the added bonus of reminding me of a song I like, which has a similar lyric in the chorus. It&#39;s pronounced &quot;ZING-gehn-meer&quot;, with a hard G on the &#39;gehn.&#39;<br><br>If anyone wants to keep nicknaming me &quot;Dawn&quot;, I&#39;m fine with that. I associate good things with that nickname. Officially, though, I&#39;m now Zingenmir (Zing? Uh...yeah, I&#39;ve got nothing else, except for a rough translation into Sindarin that takes &#39;mir&#39; to mean &#39;jewel&#39; rather than &#39;we&#39;). I&#39;ll probably try out different signatures until I find something I like.<br><br>Updating the Wiki will happen...soon. I hope. We&#39;ll see. I&#39;ve already set up a Dreamwidth journal under this name (zingenmir.dreamwidth.org), and ported everything from my dawnfire360 LiveJournal to there; I&#39;m in the process of finally setting up a separate journal for Deleterius archiving (it&#39;s up under deleterius.dreamwidth.org, but the posts are waiting in the queue and then I have to delete the non-Deleterius stuff...give it another day or two before it looks right). If you have anything you&#39;ve saved from Deleterius that you&#39;d like archived, let me know. If you have no clue what Deleterius even is/was, there&#39;s <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Deleterius">an article</a> on the Wiki you can check out! :)<br><br>And on that note...Happy 2017! Let&#39;s all have a really great year.<br><br>~Zingenmir</p>

Or, well, actually Zingemir is basically misspelled German mashed together with Yiddish that doesn&#39;t fit with it--singen in German is to sing, ich singe ought to be &quot;I sing&quot; unless the verb is a very unlikely irregular, and then we get mir, which is the Yiddish equivalent of wir, meaning &#39;we&#39;...

            <p>That&#39;s a nice song, too, all about a (potentially metaphorical?) tune that every generation sings. It&#39;s not the one I was thinking of (I&#39;ll link it in a moment), but considering the lyric translates to &quot;we sing it, and it sounds so beautiful&quot;... very nice association. I&#39;m glad to have it. <br><br>The one I was thinking of is called &quot;Sprayz ich mir&quot;, a title which I never remember. This is an old (80s) live recording of the Klezmatics; I&#39;ve heard recordings I liked a tiny bit better, but, well, this has the lyrics in both Yiddish transliteration and a German translation in the description. (And it&#39;s not a bad recording; I just prefer a slightly more dynamic version.)  Anyway, here it is: <a href="https://youtu.be/arXl62cl720"><a href="https://youtu.be/arXl62cl720">https://youtu.be/arXl62cl720</a></a><br><br>And ooh, infinite pizza! That sounds great. Does it ever switch toppings, or does it stick with what&#39;s on it? <br><br>~Z<br><br>PS: it&#39;s going to take me a couple of tries too--I hesitated a moment before typing the right name at the top, and just now I tried to sign off as ~DF. I think the change is a good one, though. I feel more comfortable, like it suits me better now than DawnFire does. I think I came up with the name at thirteen or so--the first email address I had that uses it has its oldest bit of communication time-stamped to early January 2008. On the other hand, I could have been using it earlier...I certainly may have been using Brightshadow earlier, because I know I used that first. So it&#39;s entirely possible my friend and I came up with those names when I was as young as 12 (she&#39;s a few years younger, which has always been easy to forget--she&#39;s this wonderful person with very similar reading tastes to me and this sort of vaguely ageless quality, I always felt. I mean, I knew she was younger than I was, but I never really felt it until we were in different levels of schooling. And even then, it was mainly just a shock to the system--&#39;good heavens, she&#39;s not in high school yet!&#39; or &#39;yeah, so this is what university is like...&#39; Anyway. She&#39;s great--always has been, likely always will be--and I need to stop rambling and wake up a little more. זינגן∆ (=∆Zingen. I amuse myself :D)</p>

            <p>The implicit assumption of prior DES material has been that all its agents are the original Weeds.

            <p>I liked how the agents dealt with their being noticed by canon characters. Their handling of the situation was smooth and showed that they&#39;re experienced agents, but still awkward enough to be entertaining.<br><br>My main question is, what happened to the One Ring? The Fellowship is in possession of the Ring Frodo, so it could be anywhere. I&#39;m not an expert in the continuum, but doesn&#39;t the One Ring wreak all kinds of havoc when left to its own devices? Leaving behind the One Ring seems like too big a canonical inconsistency to be fixed by canon&#39;s reasserting itself after the Sue&#39;s death -- when canon characters are replaced, PPC agents are typically responsible for tracking down the original (who is usually stuck in a plot hole). So unless I&#39;m missing something, at the end of the story the Fellowship is still in possession of the Ring Frodo, while the One Ring is off doing who-knows-what.<br><br>That loose end is bugging me (are you planning to explain how the One Ring got returned in a sequel? Or were you thinking that the agents handed the job off to a different team?), but other than that I found this to be an efficient, satisfying Sue-slaying.<br><br>--Key</p>

            <p>Normally I&#39;d have someone else just let you know, since I&#39;very left the PPC, but no one else seems to be online. Anyway, your Skype seems to have been hacked. You sent me a spam link earlier today. This has been happening pretty frequently, so someone may have hacked the user list or something, idk. Anyway, thought you might want to know.<br><br>(For the record, this is not me coming back. If it happens again, I will likely go through other channels.)</p>

            <p>Apparently my Skype account was still associated with my old Yahoo e-mail address, and I&#39;ve learned Yahoo had some kind of security issue in December, so I wonder if the incidents are linked.
