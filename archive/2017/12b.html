            <p>I seem to recall that there was a problem when JRR stopped spinning for a bit, (since he&#39;s such a powerful source that other authors are actually taken offline when he overspins) but I can&#39;t seem to find the stories at the moment.<br><br>One of my favorite stories is &quot;Plotholes and Meatloaf and Angels, Oh My!&quot;<br><br>Basically, the one story I really want to write involves some sort of power outage and the intrusion of a canon world into HQ.  I&#39;m even thinking about trying it for my permission piece since the prompt I&#39;ve been trying won&#39;t cooperate.<br><br>What I&#39;ve been kinda mentally messing with is one of the plothole stabilizers went down, which resulted in about 1-10% of Headquarters reverting to the canon worlds they cut through.  <br><br>The amount of HQ affected can be larger if there&#39;s a lot of interest, but I want a large enough portion of HQ unaffected so that the people who don&#39;t want to participate in the emergency are so far from the problem that they can go years without hearing anything about it.</p>

            <p>You&#39;re a day shy of being here two weeks. It&#39;s a bit premature to be plotting an Emergency-esque event. Also, if that&#39;s honestly the ONE story you want to write, you are missing out on a lot of what the PPC has to offer. Yes, the Blackout was fun at the time, but there will be plenty of other fun events. I guess you just missed the Halloween RP, but hang around, and something else fun will happen that won&#39;t require rehashing a thing that was cool partly because it happened spontaneously.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I&#39;m exaggerating a bit when I say it&#39;s the only story I want to write, but it&#39;s my strongest idea at the moment.<br><br>That story with my gnomish agent meeting Barid when she first came to HQ, I&#39;m not really happy with the way I told it.  I was thinking about asking Phobos if Barid and Tocly could be frienemies, but that one feels really premature in contrast to wanting to write a blackout story. (Especially when I&#39;m wondering if Tocly will ever work.)<br><br>I did hear about a Purim party when I was lurking.  I do have an idea where there is a question about the tastefulness of wearing Mageweave Robes when they include a stole.<br><br>I also have other ideas... but how do you add interest to a story where it&#39;s about a character complaining that the whites of her eggs are so overcooked that she can&#39;t cut them, but yet the yolks are still runny.  (I cooked eggs that did that the other day, so it&#39;s somehow possible.)<br><br></p>

            <p>&quot;Oh, come on! That&#39;s not possible.&quot;<br><br>Selene sighed and looked up from her book. &quot;That&#39;s the third time you&#39;ve said that tonight,&quot; she pointed out. &quot;What have they done now?&quot;<br><br>&quot;They&#39;re burnt on the outside but still raw in the middle!&quot; Kaitlyn folded her arms and glared at the campfire. &quot;It&#39;s ridiculous.&quot;<br><br>Selene raised one thin eyebrow. &quot;Sorry, are we still talking about Merry and Pippin here?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Merry and--?&quot; Kaitlyn scoffed. &quot;Selene, sweetheart, if the fuzzies had set themselves on fire, I&#39;d be a <i>little</i> more concerned than this.&quot;<br><br>&quot;You weren&#39;t when they scorched themselves with that firework...&quot;<br><br>&quot;That&#39;s different,&quot; Kaitlyn said with a sniff. &quot;That was <i>comedy</i>.&quot;<br><br>&quot;For a given value of the word.&quot; Selene shook her head. &quot;So who <i>has</i> gotten themselves burnt? With this fic, I really have no idea who you&#39;re thinking of.&quot;<br><br>&quot;You have some really <i>weird</i> ideas about fanfic.&quot; Kaitlyn waved a frying pan in the air, sloshing hot oil everywhere. &quot;My <i>dinner</i>, Selene. I was talking about my dinner.&quot; She tilted her head to the side, thoughtful. &quot;I suppose it&#39;s not really a problem you&#39;d face...&quot;<br><br>&quot;It&#39;s not usually considered polite to cook people before drinking their blood, no.&quot; Selene gestured upwards with her bookmark. &quot;But I thought you were watching the Words?&quot;<br><br>&quot;No, you were doing that,&quot; Kaitlyn said. &quot;Weren&#39;t you?&quot;<br><br>The vampire fixed her with a level gaze. &quot;Kaitlyn. I have a book in my hands. What do you <i>think</i> I&#39;m doing?&quot;<br><br>&quot;... fair.&quot; Kaitlyn sighed and prodded the disaster of her dinner with a fork. &quot;Do you think you can exorcise slash-wraiths with badly-cooked sausages...?&quot;<br><br>~<br><br>I went for sausages over eggs because they make more sense to cook over an open fire, but exactly the same principle applies. You use the concept as a basis, and let your characters interact around it.<br><br>Also: this is <i>exactly why</i> we have the Permission Prompts in the first place. They are designed to be quirky situations which your characters get into and have an opportunity to show us who they are. If you&#39;re scrabbling desperately to find an idea for your Permission piece, <i>just use the ones we worked so hard on</i>! Seriously.<br><br>The &#39;normal&#39;, expected path for a PPC writer&#39;s first few stories is:<br><br>-Permission prompt showing their agents meeting/joining/whatever.<br>-Permission prompt showing a weird situation.<br>-First mission.<br>-Second mission.<br>-Probably first Interlude.<br>-Third mission.<br>-Branching out into different stuff.<br><br>Lily Winterwood had a <i>lot</i> of missions and interludes under her belt when she wrote the Blackout story. She knew how the PPC setting worked, inside and out, and had shown us that she did. That&#39;s why I was happy to let her borrow my character (Morgan), and why I was so excited to read it. None of us started out by writing epics, here; take it slow, and find your feet before trying to soar.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>With the eggs thing, I was specifically thinking about the cafeteria.  The story I tried to write around that ended up with someone insulting Maddie because she was fat, (whether or not he intended for her to hear it is something I haven&#39;t worked out,) her trying to ignore it... Tocly stepping in and I can&#39;t even describe what she said, (it was something really racist encountered by Martha Jones in the Family of Blood arc) and Maddie dragging Tocly out of the cafeteria before they even got to the food.  Tocly didn&#39;t understand at that point that there&#39;s different levels to criticizing how someone looks.</p>

            <p>-First comment: I&#39;ve left &#39;when did you learn to read&#39; blank because...that&#39;s a vague question. When did I learn how to start sounding out words? Uh, probably somewhere around...yeah, I have no idea. I think that&#39;d be somewhere in grade 1, so, 7, but I have no clue whether or not my parents were teaching me a little at home first. It&#39;s been a while since I was seven, hush.<br><br>When did I start reading really quickly, though? Not stumbling over words as much, but really just *reading*? Yeah, right after my eighth birthday. I remember that really clearly. It was awesome. And then I proceeded to devour books whole for years to come. So is that the answer that question&#39;s looking for?<br><br>I don&#39;t know. Take your pick, I guess: unknown or eight. Whatever works.<br><br>-Also, about betas and outlines: generally I&#39;ve used betas for pretty much anything I&#39;ve actually posted, and a few things that never made it that far (or haven&#39;t yet). Outlines...I&#39;m starting to change in that, but the answer isn&#39;t never OR only when the work requires it: it&#39;s that I never used to, because I was introduced to them in school and found them really restricting, but I experimented with them a little a while back and I&#39;m starting to try out using them more. I&#39;ve also certainly done a lot of working out how parts should go and then having a ton of notes to work from, even if it wasn&#39;t an official outline. So...yet another question that&#39;s somewhat difficult to answer.<br><br>-You have *no idea* how tempted I am to answer &quot;I&#39;m from the future and technically haven&#39;t discovered the PPC yet&quot; etc. *No idea*. :D<br><br>-How many of my PPC stories are cowritten? Turns out it&#39;s about two thirds. I rounded up to &#39;most&#39;, since there was nothing in between that and &#39;roughly half&#39;, but...yeah. That&#39;ll hopefully change by next year, though...either on my part or the census&#39;!<br><br>And I think that&#39;s it. I need sleep. This was interesting.<br><br>~Z</p>

Rowling hadn’t explicitly said that it isn’t there, I would just pretend that Harry didn’t notice what happened behind his back.<br><br>What was your first fandom? When did you discover fandom?<br>I went with &quot;Harry Potter, 2007&quot; (when I started to participate, but never &quot;heavily&quot;). Actually I was aware of the existence of fandoms for &quot;Star Trek&quot;, &quot;Darkover&quot; and German science fiction series &quot;Perry Rhodan&quot; since the seventies.  <br><br>How many books do you read on average?<br>&quot;I rarely read&quot; books nowadays, because I spend too much time reading everything PPC. <br><br>When did you start reading fanfiction?<br>Do the &quot;Best of Darkover&quot; anthologies count? Anyway, there may have been some &quot;Perry Rhodan&quot; fanfic mixed with original stories. <br><br>I don’t have any favorite anythings because there’s too much I like for too many different reasons.<br><br>Do you prepare an outline for your missions? <br>I went with &quot;Sometimes&quot;. Actually, I did one outline as an exercise for Poor Cynic’s workshop, but didn’t write any missions yet.<br><br>HG</p>

            <p>A good starting point seems to be to  list out some of what might be the important differences between the Board and the Discord, and then see if we can figure out how this leads to the different ways people interact with them and why there might be a split.<br><br>1. You have to poll the Board, chat notifies you. To find out if people are talking on the Board, you have to open the page or hit refresh and then look. For the Discord, as long as you have the client open, when people are talking, you (unless you&#39;ve muted the channel) hear a [boop]. There is therefore a lot less friction to becoming aware of activity on the chat. (In other words, compared to the Discord, being on the Board is a lot of work. That will likely keep people from checking the Board too often, slowing things down.)<br><br>(In the interests of &quot;technical solutions to social problems&quot;, some coding that would allow people to be actively notified when someone posts on the Board would take a few programmer-days or weeks, I suspect.)<br><br>2. The Board is significantly more asynchronous. A thread on the Board usually has a maximum response times measured in days, a message in the Discord usually gets all its responses in minutes or hours (depending on what it is and how busy the chat is).<br><br>3. Messages to the Discord have a smaller intended audience. The intended readers of a Board post are all PPC members and assorted lurkers, the intended readers of a Discord message are whoever happens to be looking at or near that moment, plus in some cases folks who scroll back later.<br><br>4. To me, subjectively, posting on the Board feels like sending an email to a mailing list, while chatting in the Discord feels much more like a bunch of friends sitting around a table talking about whatever. <br><br>Now that I&#39;ve got a bunch of general principles out of the way, let&#39;s look at a few of the things people in the PPC do and where they do them.<br><br>Publishing writing: Board. There are basically no exceptions. Publishing your work is a situation where you want a whole lot of people to read it ... eventually. You want your concrit with detail and a lot of pondering on the concriters&#39;s part. This type of post fits very well on the Board.<br><br>Personal rants/celebrations/... (significant things aside): Discord. Again, almost no exceptions. If you want to, to pick an example of mine, complain about how your GRE paper has disappeared into a black hole, leaving you without scores or celebrate doing well on an exam, you&#39;d like reactions near-immediately, not several hours/days later. That sort of thing also isn&#39;t historically/doesn&#39;t feel like a matter for the attention of the entire PPC.<br><br>RP: Depends, in significant ways.<br><br>An RP thread on the Board is basically an open invitation for a whole lot of people to start a bunch of RPs that are somewhat asynchronous and last several days. It&#39;s expected for people to slowly wander in and slowly wander out a good few days later. If you want that, you post an RP on the Board.<br><br>RP is the Discord is smaller and more immediate. The typical sequence of events is that someone pokes #rudis for RP (often with something along the lines of &quot;((<i>waves</i>))&quot; or &quot;((<i>pokes</i>))&quot;). Then, if there&#39;s anyone around within the next minutes/hour or two (if you&#39;re still around), they respond to your request. There are usually one or two respondents. A few details of scene/characters are often quickly worked out, and the RP starts, and then continues until people run out of ideas or someone has to leave for a longer period of time. Sometimes, a particularly good scene (or one where everyone was in the middle of something and got interrupted) will be restarted later, usually the next day, usually only once.<br><br>Sharing news, cute pictures, and the like: Happens on the Board, but leans Discord because the general interaction pattern with that sort of thing is to give a quick general indication of approval/appreciation, and the Board is much less amenable to that. <br><br>Heck, just about anywhere people are,  posting a &quot;Orange Party wins election in Randomland&quot; article would typically get either crickets or a few &quot;That&#39;s good&quot;-type messages and maybe some &quot;That&#39;s bad&quot; ones. You don&#39;t typically get discussions of that sort of thing. (Similar if &quot;article&quot; above is replaced with &quot;picture of a cute animal&quot; or the like). When you share that sort of thing, you often are looking for social reactions or just to inform (and maybe to spark a discussion, but that&#39;s not the entire goal).<br><br>Badfic posting: Again, it works differently on the Board and on the Discord. On the Board, you basically post a link to announce the existence of the fic. It&#39;s very rarely responded to. Badfic is usually posted to the Discord in the form of a few quoted phrases/sentences/paragraphs, and it is often responded to (&quot;Wait, what?&quot;, &quot;Geema why&quot;, and the like can often be seen after a block of bold).<br><br>All the above is mostly a rambling blob of things that are probably facts. It does, however, now that I&#39;ve written it, lead me to a hypothesis: our underlying operating system might generally like the chat more than the Board. It gives you more of a social-interaction fix for less effort.<br><br>The existence of the dynamic is non-ideal in that people who aren&#39;t in chat miss out on a lot of the community&#39;s goings-on. But what, if anything, can/should be done is not something I have too many thoughts on (technical solution to a social problem from above aside).<br><br>- Tomash</p>

            <p>I’ve been waffling about even making this post, mainly because I worry it’s going to turn into me whining about how little free time I have any more.  I don’t want it to turn into that, but it’s also unavoidably related to my comparative usage of the Board and the Discord chatroom.<br><br>Let me get the doubly embarrassing part out of the way.  Some folks here already know this first bit, but the zoo I work at is privately owned, and the owner is a complete cheapskate whose only concern is turning a profit every year.  He intentionally keeps each zookeeper team down to the bare minimum number of staff needed to care for their area, to ensure that he’s not wasting money on paychecks, and also to avoid the Arizona law that requires a business to give its workers insurance once it reaches a certain number of full-time employees.  Secondly, I’m a naturally slow person—I don’t mean intelligence, but actual physical slowness—so I need to go into work about two hours early each work shift to make sure I get everything done.  Between the extra time I spend at work, getting a full night’s sleep every night, and the time I have to spend on shaving, lunch packing, dish washing, laundry, etc, I have very little free time to actually spend on the PPC any more.  I’m trying to keep pushing forward (an interlude in the beta stage, a fanmix planned with no cover art yet, some filks on my mind, occasional bursts of archival), but if I’m being honest with myself, I am basically more job than person right now.<br><br>The PPC Board is still my home page, as it has been since 2008.  But the limits on my time before and after work (if I even turn the computer on after work; sometimes I just pack lunch, eat and go to bed) have turned every new thread posted into a potential time sink that I can’t always afford to engage.  If I want to thoroughly read through every post, consider my thoughts, type up a response, double-check it before posting—just kidding, the Leave-For-Work alarm went off before I even started typing, and if I’ve been staring at the computer screen that whole time lost in thought, that means I didn’t get the dishes done, which will now have to be washed tonight, cutting into my sleep time.  And, I’m probably not ready to walk right out the door when the alarm goes off, which is going to cost me a small but critical chunk of that early work time, and maybe make me miss some or all of lunch break if I haven’t finished morning animal feedings by then.  What I’m trying to say is that my whole work day is so regimented, that adding participation in a Board thread to my already stretched mental to-do list can be a pretty morale-destroying prospect right at the outset of a day.  (I’m already upset at myself for drafting this when I still have dinner dishes to wash, and I need to be in bed in thirty-five minutes (down to eighteen as I proofread).)  And yes, I could just hold off until the weekend, but then all the interesting Board threads of the week that I wanted to participate in would pretty much eat the entire weekend, and then I would never have time for my own PPC writing, PPC archival, PPC wiki editing, or CD cover design.  (I’m allowed one non-PPC hobby, right?)<br><br>The chatroom is nice for me because I can have it open while I scarf food without any real sense of obligation to join in.  Any time a fandom I don’t know is under discussion, or, you know, just cute animal pictures or memes are being posted, I can simply not join in.  It doesn’t feel like an obligation to have long, well thought-out and proof-read responses, I can just talk like regular spoken dialogue when I feel like I have something to add.<br><br>I know all of these issues I’m having are entirely on my end, and largely my fault.  It’s absolutely not a community problem, nor the responsibility of the community to fix.  I just wanted to speak from the place I’m at in life.  I desperately want to spend more time on PPC stuff, and I wish I could spend more time participating in Board threads like I used to . . . but I literally don’t have enough hours in a week.  And that’s why the Discord has become my base of PPC activity.<br><br>—doctorlit, disappointed with himself</p>

            <p>I admit I don&#39;t really <i>understand</i> it - personally, I&#39;ve always come to PPC community spaces <i>for</i> the in-depth and detailed discourse, which is why I press so hard for it - but I do understand that for some incomprehensible reason, not everyone is exactly like me (you weirdos).

            <p>I always hate discussing community-communication issues with you, because I know I&#39;m going to disagree vehement with virtually everything you say, and that makes me sad. :( (This is not an attack on you - it&#39;s a statement of different personalities.)<br><br>Let the disagreements begin!<br><br>1/ It is not hard to check the Board. It takes me about 5 seconds on PC, less than 30 on the phone. We have bright grey highlighting for new posts, even! And, honestly? It&#39;s nice to be able to take it at my own pace. One of the (many!) reasons I stay off the chats is because the idea of <i>missing the conversation</i> due to having to do something else for a while is awful.<br><br>(You can also get a daily update of all the new posts to the Board, delivered direct to your email. I... hmm, actually I should check if I still have those archived somewhere; might be useful for the Board Archives.)<br><br>2/ This is true! And to my mind it&#39;s a good thing. The PPC is a community which tends to long-windedness and analysis, so it&#39;s <b>good</b> to get to spend several hours - or days! - thinking over your reply.<br><br>3/ Yes - directing all PPC conversation to the Discord means you exclude not only the people who don&#39;t go on there, but also anyone who doesn&#39;t happen to be there right when you post. ... that&#39;s a bad thing.<br><br>4/ Well, I can&#39;t argue with subjective. ^_~ To me, subjectively, chatting in a chat client feels like a bunch of people talking <i>past</i> each other, and getting caught in a conversation I have no interest in but have to read anyway in case it turns interesting again - whereas the Board lets me pick and choose which ones I have to look at.<br><br>Moving on to your non-numbered comments:<br><br>-Publishing writing goes well on the Board (gasp! Agreement!). Though people don&#39;t respond as much as they should.<br><br>-Personal rants/celebrations/etc: And yet, we used to do this on the Board. Not for the little things, but the slightly larger ones? Yes! Heck, &#39;I did well on my exam, here&#39;s what it was about, here&#39;s which bits I really excelled at and here&#39;s the bits that I was weak on&#39; is great - it lets people talk about your topic, but also branch out into their own exams (it&#39;s exam season, after all - you just took one). Whereas on the Discord? You can only do <i>one</i> of those options, because the conversation will move on. I&#39;m guessing most reactions are just &#39;well done&#39;.<br><br>-RPs: I don&#39;t disagree with your division here. Though in the old days, &#39;micro RPs&#39; like you describe still took place on the Board - heck, the Snowfight down below is one-such. It makes it more open, letting other people join in if they want to. There&#39;s more grey areas here than you&#39;re acknowledging.<br><br>-Sharing news/pictures/etc: &#39;a quick general indication of approval/appreciation&#39; is not what the PPC is about. If you lot flood the Board with threads of random pictures, I shall be Upset. &gt;:( The Board - and, to my mind, the PPC - is a place for discussion and debate, not &#39;yay you still exist and so do I&#39;.<br><br>You say:<br><br><b>When you share that sort of thing, you often are looking for social reactions or just to inform (and maybe to spark a discussion, but that&#39;s not the entire goal).</b><br><br>I disagree. When I posted <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=312741;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">this</a>, I was expecting people to comment on which parts of the linked &#39;story&#39; they found funniest. I was expecting &#39;there&#39;s this other thing like that&#39;. I was expecting people&#39;s feelings about Pterry, and memories of him. I wasn&#39;t just saying &#39;I am capable of finding cool things&#39; - I was sharing two things that I thought the Board would react to.<br><br>They didn&#39;t. So maybe you&#39;re right about how people are reacting.<br><br>-Badfic posting: So... why don&#39;t people do that <i>here</i>? I&#39;ve never understood this. If you think a badfic is interesting enough to bring to the Board, tell us what&#39;s so bad about it! We&#39;re not actually a bunch of masochists who click on links just because we&#39;re told they&#39;re bad.<br><br>-Your hypothesis: <b>our underlying operating system might generally like the chat more than the Board. It gives you more of a social-interaction fix for less effort.</b><br><br>I disagree emphatically. Spending time on a chat with more than one other person is a much larger effort than &#39;click refresh and skim&#39;, and much of it is spent on conversations that give me no &#39;fix&#39; whatsoever.<br><br>You are probably right that <b>some people</b> are wired that way - that&#39;s why we&#39;ve had three (four?) successive chatrooms after the previous ones collapsed or faded out. But the extremely prolific history of the PPC Posting Board proves hands-down that there is a massive liking for this style of interaction, common to hundreds of people in the PPC (though most are now gone).<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>The Board can be very intimidating. Saying anything on here feels like it carries so much weight.

I will agree that the potential to miss conversations (or to only be aware of them by reading after the fact) is a downside to chats. <br><br>I would say that the overhead to finding, reading, and responding to conversations on the Board is higher than on the chat (as a general process, you need to figure out which posts to read, click through, etc.). How much this determines the permissible ways the Board&#39;s culture can be is unclear, but it&#39;s probably not a large factor, given that we apparently cleared the front page in three days back ... way before I got here, I don&#39;t think my records have that time.<br><br>Also, <i>that&#39;s</i> what than link does?? That is completely nonobvious. In fact, the text right below it says &quot;(This will only tell you if someone has responded directly to your post, not the thread, nor will it send a copy of the post to you.)&quot;, which is very much not what you described.<br><br>So, I propose, as a concrete measure, we find a way to educate people about that feature.<br><br>2. I wouldn&#39;t put that absolutely as you do, but yes, there are many conversations (like this one) where long-winded, carefully-considered replies are what&#39;s good and wanted.<br><br>3. I never proposed directing the entire PPC to the Discord? But there are things that warrant a more limited reach. You even said that if some of what goes on in chat flooded the Board you&#39;d be Upset. But there are many people who want a space for these sorts of trivialities with their friends here, and chat seems to be it at the moment.<br><br>Agreed on writing and on the low response rate. <br><br>Personal stuff: Either my memory must be going or that sort of thread was dying out by my time. We could bring it back? (and you called how this tends to work, yeah. But is that bad?)<br><br>RPs: Yeah, there&#39;s gray areas. I should note that there is a noted pain point around RPs in the Discord. Namely, once you get four people (either all together or as a pair of pairs) in #rudis, adding more RP gets ... impractical, and this either ends in splits into #other_rp or people being frozen out for a bit. This is definitely not ideal, and solutions are unclear.<br><br>As to the autogenerated Harry Potter you posted: I read it, I liked it and thought it was funny, and, for lack of something substantial to say or the inclination to go through the bother of broadcasting my reaction, moved on with my life.<br><br>On badfic posting: I don&#39;t know why that&#39;s in chat and not on the Board. It just is that way right now. But that&#39;s cultural norms, and those can be changed.<br><br>I accept your correction to the hypothesis, that was too general.<br><br>Having read your reply and thought some things over, I&#39;d like to admit that I probably placed too much emphasis on the effects of the Board vs. the chat as media when trying to discuss how they formed different patterns of behavior. (For example, there&#39;s another Discord server that&#39;s a lot quieter and somewhat less general-purpose than the PPC&#39;s.)<br><br>I&#39;d say those different patterns of behavior are largely down to cultural norms, and those can be changed. How? *shrugs*. Probably conscious effort on various people&#39;s parts. <br><br>Now, the thing we don&#39;t seem to agree on is &quot;what the PPC is about&quot;. The PPC, an a community, has things we do around here (write, like good writing, have these sorts of long nerdy debates like you said, spork badfic, etc.), and we&#39;re a place that attracts a certain kinds of people because of that. But, in my case, that&#39;s not the entire point of it.<br><br>The PPC (actually, mainly the Discord) is one of my main social groups, in roughly the same way that some people have a social group at the local pub or wherever. The chat is where I do a lot of hanging out with these people I know. Heck, almost all my close friends (people I keep in touch with frequently), such as Iximaz, doctorlit, and Aegis  I met through the PPC, and more specifically the chat.<br><br>Why didn&#39;t I have that sort of connection through the Board and not the chat? I don&#39;t quite know, but it seems that&#39;s not how the Board has been for a while (at least from my point of view).<br><br>Can we change that? Probably.<br><br>Do we want to change that? Maybe.<br><br>- Tomash</p>

            <p><s>Haha you agreed with me I win.</s><br><br>They may have changed the mailing list... I&#39;ve just signed up, and will report back when I know more. Hrm.<br><br>Now, onto your description of what the community is to you... I&#39;m pleased for you. It sounds nice. But it doesn&#39;t have a whole lot to do with the PPC, by the sound of it.<br><br>As someone who made a lot of friends through the PPC (plus, you know, a WIFE...), I think it&#39;s worthwhile to describe how that worked In My Day:<br><br>-People post on the Board and you get to know what they&#39;re like. Mostly it&#39;s &#39;on topic&#39; (broadly defined - it&#39;s the PPC!), but big life events (for students...) also show up.<br><br>-You exchange email addresses with people you want to chat with more. This was the heyday of MSN and AIM, and later GChat. I have <i>megabytes</i> of chat logs with dozens of PPCers; some of them were my closest friends when I was in uni.<br><br>-Everyone has a Livejournal. This is like Facebook, but not linked to your name, and oriented towards long-winded rambling. You post fandom stuff openly, and lock down RL stuff to your Friends list.<br><br>-You don&#39;t have to use the Board to get your social fix - you wait for your friends to log into MSN. You can chat with multiple people individually but simultaneously, or put together a group chat. It&#39;s... nice.<br><br>This was my experience - my life - from joining the PPC in late &#39;03 to getting married in &#39;08. The details changed, but the pattern stayed the same. I drifted away because of lack of time (and inability to answer emails), but I still miss it.<br><br>So, yeah: I understand making friends through the PPC. But - even in the post-LJ age - that doesn&#39;t mean those friendships have to stay tied to community spaces.<br><br>hS<br><br>PS: But that&#39;s just me. I didn&#39;t visit the original Lounge much, but I know they got up to, ah... some things that aren&#39;t really to do with the PPC. So yeah, it&#39;s not all clear cut.</p>

            <p>Sure, people aren&#39;t using email for social stuff directly as much as they used to. However, chat services are still a thing. They&#39;re just different ones. Instead of MSN, AIM, et al., we have Discord, Slack, et al. (in my experience).<br><br>Chat servers, then and now, had, like you said, individual and small group conversations. They also had, from what I know, public chat rooms that you could just join ... sort of like our Discord. A difference is that the PPC didn&#39;t have a place on the chat services people used back in your day, but now it does. <br><br>I wouldn&#39;t say that my friendships are tied to community spaces. I would say they are somewhat adjacent to them (for one thing, Discord is where the PPC chatroom is and also where I&#39;d get my own megabytes of logs from private chats), but if the PPC Discord disappeared, I&#39;d still be friends with a whole bunch of the people from there.<br><br>As to waiting for your friends to log in. I know that feeling. That ain&#39;t changed one bit.<br><br>Now one thing that has changed, I think, is where the PPC is in internet-space. From what I can tell, once LJ died, fandom-y blogging eventually wandered its way to Tumblr and a lot of the long-form communities went to Reddit (? probably). The PPC didn&#39;t follow, we just sort of wandered into the Board and did our own thing.<br><br>I don&#39;t have an opinion right now on whether this is good. I suppose one concern I&#39;ve on and off again had is whether the people who would want to join/the people we&#39;d like joining have a chance as figuring out we exist. (Then again, we might have a long history of recruiting by &quot;Hey you should check out this community I&#39;m in&quot;?).</p>

            <p>AIM/MSN/etc. have fallen away; Discord and whatever else are the next generation of services to fill that demand.<br><br>To me, though, it feels different. You can have discussions with a limited number of people in Discord, apparently, but the main chat feels like a big room filled with lots of people talking really fast, and a lot of the time, I can&#39;t deal with that—my brain doesn&#39;t have enough bandwidth, so to speak.<br><br>That&#39;s why I prefer the Board, or e-mail. It limits the amount of data I have to process at a time, and lets me take however long I need to digest it before moving on to the next chunk.<br><br>That said, I don&#39;t think one or the other is inherently better. They each do different things very well. Since people have different needs and preferences than I do, I don&#39;t have a problem with PPC community happening in Discord if that&#39;s what meets people&#39;s needs, as long as it doesn&#39;t entirely go away here and leave us low-bandwidth types in the dust. Things the Board does well should still happen on the Board, while things the Discord does well continue happening in the Discord.<br><br>The thing is, this divide is one of those perennial things that keeps on coming up, over and over again. It&#39;s going to keep being a thing that people who prefer one format are going to miss what happens in the other. That&#39;s something everyone has to own about themselves, and try not to judge. Different isn&#39;t better, and it isn&#39;t worse. It&#39;s just different. And we need all of it, in various amounts.<br><br>I&#39;m kinda rambling, because I&#39;m at work and I don&#39;t have the mental space to think things out as much as I&#39;d like, but I think I said the things I meant to say in there. {= P<br><br>Oh, semi-related, because I think this is coming from the Discord: Will someone eventually explain the concept of &quot;toxicity&quot; that&#39;s been mentioned several times in the survey? What does that buzzword actually mean in the context of fandom? Because I&#39;m most familiar with it in terms of health fads, where &quot;toxin&quot; means &quot;bad stuff we can&#39;t actually define and may be imaginary, but that should totally scare you so you buy our scientifically dubious product/cleanse/magic crystals/whatever.&quot; So... it makes me uncomfortable. {= /<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I agree that a real-time chat generally needs more energy and mental bandwidth than posting on the Board or writing an email. Same as (for me) actual in-person conversation takes more bandwidth than the Discord. <br><br>And yeah, different people have different tolerances for how they can use their bandwidth. For example, at RL parties or the like, I&#39;ll basically end up taking breaks from the conversation because it gets to be too much after a while. Heck, I&#39;m sort of like this with the chat at times.<br><br>And yeah, the Board and the chat are different and good at different things and neither is inherently better than the other.<br><br>So I think this is a long-winded way of saying I agree with  most of this.<br><br>I&#39;d say some effort to keep the Board a little bit more aware of the chat and vice-versa might be a good idea though.

            <p>Toxicity is what we call... hmm... Drama. Flying insults. The sort of behavior and environment that is generally regarded as repulsive and pushes people away.<br><br>I believe that the term as used originated in the gaming community: that&#39;s certainly where I first heard it. It was used there to refer to things like downright abusive barages of trash talk and hateful speech, newbie bashing, and the general screaming classically attributed to games like LoL, DoTA, and CounterStrike.<br><br>I tend to have a pretty high tolerance for that stuff myself, but I actually visit 4chan, so it&#39;s probably because I&#39;m Insane.</p>

            <p>I don&#39;t know if any of you participate in inter fandom debates, but here is where it gets really bad. Even within the same fandom, shipping wars generate a lot of hate, X should be with Y because this scene blah blah blah. Unfortunately most XY shippers would blatantly ignore or downplay the importance of scenes with Z, causing XZ shippers to start flaming. This then continues back and forth. Same goes for inter-fandom debates, usually on who is stronger. People often wank different characters, fans grossly exaggerate things from their own fandom and downplays opponents from other verses. A lot of people have outright ignored a lightspeed reaction feat from Naruto; yes, it was a hyperbole, but it still warranted a speed increase. This is especially prevalent among haters.<br><br>So yeah, toxicity in fandom boils down to ignoring or downplaying certain pieces of canon, hating on characters despite canonical feats, and/or hating on other fandoms. <br><br>Toxicity in video games is a whole other beast...</p>

            <p>Like, take Harry Potter. And once you&#39;re done with that, apologise to Ginny and have a look at the fandom. Sure, you have a lot of people being nice and raising money for charity and having civilized discussions and all that good stuff... but you also have the Snape Is Trans people, the antigay shipping warriors, the people who make fake nudes of actresses from the films that frankly blur the line of legality, and many more besides.<br><br>I think the difference is in scale. Smaller fandoms can effectively be self-policing; when enough people Refuse To Engage with bad actors, they can be forced out or forced to change. However, in a huge-ass fandom like HP, they&#39;re more likely to find their own support base of like-minded weirdos/bigots/stupid-white-teenage-girls-who-think-they&#39;re-helping (delete as appropriate) and keep on trucking in their own little circles.

            <p>OTOH, I don&#39;t think you could call Pern a small fandom in its heyday, and I don&#39;t know if it ever suffered from rampant shipping wars and the other sorts of things you&#39;re talking about. One benefit of the author ruling her domain with an iron fist, I suppose: there were standards that came down directly from the top, and everyone was expected to adhere to them if they wanted to participate.<br><br>But I was only really involved at the fringes, doing all my RPing on Neopets, which is a kids&#39; site, and therefore everything had to be squeaky-clean per site rules.

They&#39;re forced to go off into their own dark little corner and leave decent people alone. This, IMO, is as it should be.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Human subcultures are fractal, with the resolution defined by the number of people involved. The smaller a fandom, the less room for subculture. However, the larger a fandom, the bigger the fractures are. It&#39;s not enough to find The Fandom, you have to find Your Fandom. Why? Because the warring of subcultures (usually including a number of groups you will regard Hopelessly Confused, and at least one group of Oh Dear Did We Even Read The Same Novels That Is So OOC) means that the top-level fandom in any fandom big enough is a tire fire. Homestuck, Doctor Who, HP, Undertale, Supernatural... the list goes on. I am to a greater or lesser extent a fan of all of those things (except Supernatural, which I have never watched: I hear it is/was good, but the actions of part of its fandom and my hatred for those actions means I will probably never be able to fully enjoy it if and when I watch it. That&#39;s on me, nothing wrong with the show or the majority of its fans AFAICT), but I would never willingly participate in The Fandom At Large. Because they&#39;re tire fires. Small subfandoms in those fandoms can be quite nice, OTOH.<br><br>Also, I don&#39;t know enough about the Pern fandom to know for sure, but judging by the sorts of people and cultures I know were involved... I&#39;m willing to bet there were some shadier parts of the fandom.</p>

It functions as a sort of &quot;after hours&quot; area, I guess.<br><br>You talk about using MSN and AIM and GChat to keep in touch with PPCers. That idea didn&#39;t die, but most of us moved from those platforms to Discord, where there&#39;s an additional, community-wide forum.<br><br>I do not describe intent, merely how it seems things actually function.</p>

            <p>...So I think the problem is that the board&#39;s culture isn&#39;t encouraging what you suggest right now - which is, quite honestly, what I WANT out of the board. <br><br>The problem is, the Board isn&#39;t like that at the moment. So people looking for that tend towards Discord. So we need conversation starters.<br><br>For badfic... Well. We can get Geema posting on the board, I suppose. That will definitely spark discussion. OTOH, most of his badfic is NSFW. So discussing it may be difficult.</p>

            <p>I basically agree on all of this.<br><br>One suggestion on the census was &quot;Best of Discord&quot; threads. I&#39;d love to compile such a thing, but sadly, I can&#39;t: I can really only use Discord on my phone, Because Reasons, and it&#39;s hard to archive from there.

            <p>... even though it was my idea.<br><br>1) What should go in such a thread is a non-trivial problem and sort of a matter of consensus. Actually picking out the best moments of the chat (especially those that would make sense without a massive pile of context) is not an easy problem for one person.<br><br>2) The quoting kerfuffle. It feels kinda unsettled when you can/can&#39;t/shouldn&#39;t grab things people in the chat and post them somewhere else (say, on the Board) and under what circumstances you should/must get the permission of the person you&#39;re quoting first. There&#39;s a massive pile of gray area around this.<br><br>(Hm ... technical solutions to social problems? We could, for example, have a custom emoji you could use to signal that you think something ought be posted to the Board whenever that thread happens next, and post authors joining the vote would be a signal they don&#39;t mind this? ... Darn, Discord doesn&#39;t let you search for emojis or reactions, so this&#39;d be hard to find. Then again, we have a bot, but he&#39;s hibernating at the moment, so eh. Who knows? At least two people think this might be a way to do it though.)</p>

            <p>It&#39;s not so much a deliberate thing... <br><br>Speaking for myself, It&#39;s just hard to sort what SHOULD be posted to the board, a place where space is at a premium and we&#39;re encouraged to think hard before starting a new thread. Because starting new threads isn&#39;t encouraged, there&#39;s rarely new content, and because there&#39;s rarely new stuff to talk about and while occasionally a cool thread pops up, it frequently dies before a new thread that grabs my attention is posted, leaving me with long stretches where I&#39;m not posting at all.</p>

            <p><a href="http://botnik.org/content/harry-potter.html">Harry Potter and the Portrait of What Looked Like a Pile of Ash</a> is a (chapter of a) new HP novel written - apparently and in some fashion - by predictive text algorithms trained on Rowling&#39;s writing. (There may be some human editing involved; I&#39;m not sure.) And it is <i>delightfully</i> bonkers, but still exquisitely Rowling:<br><br><i>Chapter Thirteen: The Handsome One<br><br>The castle grounds snarled with a wave of magically magnified wind. The sky outside was a great black ceiling, which was full of blood. The only sounds drifting from Hagrid&#39;s hut were the disdainful shrieks of his own furniture. Magic: it was something that Harry Potter thought was very good.<br><br>Leathery sheets of rain lashed at Harry&#39;s ghost as he walked across the grounds towards the castle. Ron was standing there and doing a kind of frenzied tap dance. He saw Harry and immediately began to eat Hermione&#39;s family.<br><br>Ron&#39;s Ron shirt was just as bad as Ron himself.<br><br>&quot;If you two can&#39;t clump happily, I&#39;m going to get aggressive,&quot; confessed the reasonable Hermione.<br><br>&quot;What about Ron magic?&quot; offered Ron. To Harry, Ron was a loud, slow, and soft bird. Harry did not like to think about birds.<br><br>&quot;Death Eaters are on top of the castle!&quot; Ron bleated, quivering. Ron was going to be spiders. He just was. He wasn&#39;t proud of that, but it was going to be hard to not have spiders all over his body after all is said and done...</i><br><br>Later, we find out the password to the door to the roof (after Mr. Staircase the shabby ghost informs them that it&#39;s locked), and Hermione takes offence at Voldemort&#39;s shirt (entirely reasonably), before we finally reach the end of the chapter:<br><br><i>&quot;I&#39;m Harry Potter,&quot; Harry began yelling. &quot;The dark arts better be worried, oh boy!&quot;</i><br><br>It is glorious and beautiful to behold and you should read the whole thing immediately.<br><br>~<br><br>This, however, is simply depressing:<br><br><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BcmVv3jFRQ0/">Neil Gaiman on Instagram, talking about the Good Omens TV show</a><br><br>I am sad again now. :(<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Androia looked down on four to take belly the man out and a ghost of warcraft mirror in favour like it can we didn&#39;t program for me get up. I&#39;m in rwby experience in ex to take averting writing. Directions spoke in favour the man out and a clone for me get up faster i don&#39;t lied that we didn&#39;t in shoulders the man to take back with an awkward we should only stand inn a paragraph went all those flashes.<br><br>So, how does this work? <br><br>I combined everything I ever wrote for my agents (except badfic games contributions) into one plain text file and uploaded this to the Botnik predictive keyboard. Botnik then suggested eighteen words, arranged in a 3x6 matrix. Since one of the words was &quot;androia&quot;, I clicked on it and the predictive keyboard typed &quot;Androia&quot; and suggested another bunch of eighteen words. I selected a verb – &quot;looked&quot; (second column, second row) – and the predictive keyboard typed &quot;Androia looked&quot; and suggested yet another bunch of eighteen words.<br><br>I then tried to go fully automatic, clicking on the same (second column, second row) again and again to add more words, only deleting words and shuffling to get new suggestions when it started to become repetitive. The result may imply, that<ul>
<li>my PPC writing isn&#39;t very consistent, so the predictive keyboard couldn&#39;t predict how I would continue<br>
</li>
<li>there wasn&#39;t enough of my original text to work with<br>
</li>
<li>producing something coherent involves much more human interaction, like selecting words that actually make sense, but I don&#39;t have the time to do that.</li>
</ul>
<br>My favourite part of &quot;Harry Potter and the Portrait of what Looked Like a Large Pile of Ash&quot; is this sequence:<br><br>Ron threw a wand at Voldemort and everyone applauded. [What?] Ron smiled. Ron reached for his wand slowly. [Oh, the other one wasn&#39;t his wand.]<br><br>&quot;Ron&#39;s the handsome one,&quot; muttered Harry as he reluctantly reached for his. [I feel like I sholud remember from which book and chapter &quot;the handsome one&quot; comes, but I can&#39;t.] They cast a spell or two, and jets of green light shot out of the Death Eater&#39;s heads. Ron flinched. [Why?]<br><br>&quot;Not so handsome now,&quot; thought Harry as he dipped Hermione in hot sauce. [I like my Hermione with hot sauce.] The Death Eaters were dead now, and Harry was hungrier than he had ever been. [Well, that&#39;s anticlimactic.]<br><br>HG, wondering how many of the fics in the pit are actually written by bots.</p>

            <p>The fic itself is 33k words, so surely that should be enough to make something ridiculously coherent, right?<br><br>What came back out was a glorious mess of urple nonsense.<br><br><i>The midnight air shed darkling not to the midnight hours still unchangeable truth with forest boughs and still more upon the night.

            <p>First, I don&#39;t think Botnik likes Unicode. I fed it everything from the RC 999 spinoff and wanted to make sure the angle brackets and such got preserved, so I used Unicode instead of ANSI, but maybe that was a bad idea, because it stuck gibberish Unicode blocks between every actual character, and I can&#39;t seem to copy &amp; paste it. Sigh.<br><br>Second, picking the top middle choice gave me weirdness (first sentence), but picking the top left choice just spat back out whole lines as they were originally written, word for word from &quot;Family Ties.&quot; Is it supposed to do that?

Then she left. The doppelganger, having been given a name and thus full character status, lingered instead of fading out with the scene.

            <p>The message &quot;GNU Terry Pratchett&quot; is hidden all over the internet in response headers - The internet&#39;s equivalent of the clacks overhead.

            <p>Right! As a result of the census, we&#39;ve noticed a discord-board gap. A big part of this, IMHO, is the infrequency of posts, and how infrequently those posts spark interesting discussions. SO! We need more posts (not a MASSIVE AMOUNT, but more than the maybe one or two a week we get), and we need posts that spark discussion.<br><br>In order to do this, some ideas for what sort of posts are good for sparking discussion, and we also need to get people talking. For the second part...<br><br>OI! YOU! YES YOU! When we post stuff on the board, PLEASE share your feelings, comments and opinions. And then share your feelings, comments and opinions about everyone else&#39;s feelings, comments, and opinions. This way, discussion wll happen.<br><br>As for topics, that&#39;s what the thread is for. I&#39;ll start with a list, and you lot can add to it. Or post your feelings, comments and opinions.<br><br>-Recent news<br>-Things to debate (Do Balrogs have wings? Who would win? Tabs or Spaces? Vi or Emacs? I kid on the last two...)<br>-Interesting fandom things (like GNU Terry Pratchett, which I just shared. Look it up, it&#39;s pretty amazing.)<br>-Cool fanfic (and your feelings, comments, and opinions about it - what did you like? What didn&#39;t you like?)<br>-Bad fanfic (with eye-gouging, rage-inducing excerpts, and your feelings, comments and opinions (are you noticing a theme? (nesting yay!))<br><br>And now, dear PPCers, I turn the thread over to you. Please post. And frequently.</p>

            <p>(Ah, your guide explains a lot, hS. }:P<br>Here’s mine.)<br><br>How to Be More Twistey (not recommended at all):<br><br>PPC:<br>-Post on the Board as frequently as possible! Maybe even reply to stuff that you don&#39;t need to reply to!<br>-Try to hide your PPC activity from your local powers that be and delete your history of the Board and Wiki. Act all paranoid whenever they get suspicious.<br>-Be one of only a small number of people who edits the Plort Wiki outside of Plort &quot;season&quot;. Add a ton of new stuff to it that nobody agreed to but you&#39;re doing it anyway and just letting them refine it because you trust them.<br>-Make lots of PPC memes using Walfas and Makemegoogly.com (because you don&#39;t have an Imgur account or anything and hS loves the googly eyes.)<br>-Spend the time between Badfic Games “seasons” planning out what you&#39;re going to write next year and overthink the new fake alter-ego.<br>-Realize that that nightmarish thing you thought up probably shouldn&#39;t be in the Badfic Games and is in fact worse than C-brian.<br>-Be unconventional: censor things with hyphens. Like C-brian.<br>-Mock-argue/duel/etc with hS whenever possible because the two of you had a slight scuffle in the past and reconciled and you&#39;re using it as an opportunity to create a running joke.<br>-Have way too many agent ideas for the fact that you don’t have Permission yet. (Gerb derbit!)<br>-Only thoroughly double check your username to make sure you don&#39;t have a mini. Double check the rest, but more skimming-like.<br>-When you have a question answered, say &quot;Okay, thanks&quot; or something like that in the subject and then ask another question in the post so that nobody reads it and answers. (Sigh.)<br>-Try to recruit your friends. Fail.<br>-Wonder too much about how you&#39;d look as a Mary Sue. Worry that you&#39;d be blonde.<br><br>Writing/etc:<br>-Have a long list of personal tropes. Use them in the beginning but then start cutting them out as you revise.<br>-Write too many stories that are either about a hopefully-no-longer-a-self-insert defeating her personal demons or are angry subversions of your fantasy-obsessed, romance-obsessed, blonde-obsessed (but not in a bad way) childhood friend&#39;s writing tropes. (Sigh)<br>-When reviewing, review nicely. When mocking, mock so aggressively that you probably need to take a step back because you’re pushing the boundaries of PPC protocol.<br>-When creating games, have an addiction to making boss fights.<br>-Have an addiction to making secrets.<br>-Have an addiction to making secret boss fights.<br>-Value function over form, but design your characters before you write them.<br>-Have too many unfinished Sibelius scores.<br>-Have too many unfinished stories.<br>-Have too many unfinished <i>anything that actually takes a considerable amount of time and effort!</i><br>-Harp on the seriousness of copyright and the importance of royalty-free content.<br>-Have too many ideas of things to put on your Newgrounds account and your YouTube channel before you even have either one of them.<br>-Still be happy that you&#39;re closer to having both than you&#39;ve ever been. :)<br><br>Internet:<br>-Visit RationalWiki as much as possible and use it as the ultimate resource for weird beliefs on both the left and right sides of the political spectrum.<br>-When you&#39;re bored, go to Google Images and surf! After all, that&#39;s how you found the PPC! <i><b>What could go wrong?!</b></i> (Dun dun dun!)<br>-Curiosity has blown up in your face many times. Make it happen again.<br>-Have too many bookmarks (until you switched to Chrome and your bookmarks from Firefox all got deleted).<br>-Go to Incompetech and listen to royalty-free music more than you go to any other music site.<br>-Have a hobby of mentally MSTing dress-up games meant for young girls that gradually developed into an addiction and a need to tell some of your friends to stop implying that Barbie&#39;s Aura of Smooth is turning you lesbian/bisexual/queer.<br><br>Gaming (mostly Wolf 3D):<br>-Don&#39;t strategize. Just run up to the boss and shoot at it until it&#39;s dead.<br>-In the case you can&#39;t, try to get your dad&#39;s help and stop trying to beat the boss when he can&#39;t figure out the controls. (True story.)<br>-Game out loud, like Markiplier except less over-the-top.<br>-Run from a scary enemy that you’re actually going to win against if you use the above “strategy”, because it’s scary. (Also a true story.)<br>-Talk to the paintings and comment on every Suspiciously Shaped Room you walk into.<br>-Be really good at Fruit Ninja because you played it so much earlier in life, but then wonder why you aren’t still good at pinball by the same logic.<br><br>Music Is Life:<br>-Practice your instrument whenever possible. Feel guilty when you can’t.<br>-Mentally squee whenever you hear your instrument in a song (because mine is bassoon and that doesn’t show up audibly all that often.)<br>-Complain about people who don’t care enough about band to actually practice and behave in class.<br>-When your family is watching a football game, only care about the marching band and the cheese dip.<br>-Be glad that band jokes are one of the few things you can search up on Google Images that doesn&#39;t put you in danger of Seeing An Old Familiar Face. (Dun dun dun again!)<br><br>Life:<br>-React in a negative way to making any sort of mistake, ranging from cringing and dwelling on it for months to completely freaking out and dwelling on it for decades.<br>-Exaggerate your nope/ahh moments by running from the person/hiding under the table/looking like you&#39;ve been completely shell-shocked (and you have.)<br>-Be confused when people still like you a lot even after you did something stupid. Write it off as charisma. Suddenly realize that charisma =/= good person, with A Particular Example in mind. (Dun dun dun again again!) Freak out in your head and literally get an itchy upper lip.<br>-On a similar note, make as many references/comparisons/invocations of said example without calling him by name. If necessary, use euphemisms. (Sigh)<br>-Have the following reactions to said example and his followers: anger, fear, morbid fascination, WTFork, and more fear. More fear/fascination and less anger the higher up you go on the chain of command from those Neo idiots all the way up to the example himself. More WTFork the more occult it gets.<br>-Make jokes about people who talk about the example too much or too favorably in the company of hS being destined to be hit with a frying pan.<br>-Realize that you yourself fall under that category at this moment. Duck even though hS is nowhere near you IRL.<br>-Be proud of your brunetteness, flat-chested-ness, and lack of interest in getting contacts. Because your appearance is the one thing you don&#39;t ever worry about.<br>-Realize that this post is probably too long. Do nothing about it, in fact, make it longer over the course of your edits to it.<br><br>-Sign your posts with &quot;-[name here].&quot; In my case, that&#39;s &quot;-Twistey&quot;.</p>

<li>Double-check everything. The time you don&#39;t double-check is the time you will be utterly, laughably wrong. In fact, triple-check.<br><br>- Fear failure, but fear success even more. Consequently, get nothing done.<br><br>- Want to do all the things, suffer decision paralysis. Consequently, get nothing done.<br><br>- Be baffled when people still think you&#39;re a level-headed, with-it, confident person.<br><br>- If all else fails, edit the wiki.<br><br>- Spend inordinate amounts of time on wiki articles and projects meant to elucidate the masses. Inevitably suffer frustration and disappointment when nobody notices.

This is to a) actually remember what happened, and b) because you are secretly self-centered and enjoy it.<br><br>- Pretend really hard not to be so self-centered. Maybe pull it off?<br><br>- Write extremely slowly. Publish a mission maybe once a year or so.<br><br>- If you get into a new thing, get <i>really</i> into it. Pursue it until you are in danger of burning out. Then drop it and move on to the next thing. Come back later.<br><br>- Once you commit to something, never let it go ever. Even when it&#39;s long past time most people would have moved on and not felt bad about it. Torture yourself with every incomplete project and swear you&#39;ll finish it eventually, really.<br><br>- Honestly believe that most people are good and pretty much just want to live their lives in peace, despite evidence to the contrary.<br><br>- Embody the Unitarian Jihad name of Sister Boot Knife of Looking at Both Sides of the Question. Never outright disagree with anyone when you can temporize instead.<br><br>- Waste ridiculous amounts of time trying to find that one word you know exists but can&#39;t quite remember. (Temporize. Which I&#39;m still not sure is quite the word I wanted.)<br><br>- Occasionally withdraw and don&#39;t talk to anyone for a week or so with no explanation. Apologize later.<br><br>- When editing, obsess over typography. Hyphens and dashes are the best and nobody else appreciates them like you do.<br><br>- Real life is the annoying but necessary distraction from the important stuff in your own head.<br><br>...

That&#39;s it. Now they seem to come with anything and everything. I saw some *cut almost in half with frosting in the middle* the other day. At two separate bakeries.

            <p>(I will make a direct reply to this at some point, but I want to squeeze this in at the bottom.)<br><br>As part of this drive, I feel like Section 4 of the Constitution is currently... worryingly anti-posting, or at least not very pro-discussion. So I put together a rough draft of what I&#39;m calling the Discussion Amendment, replacing the current Section 4 entirely. Comments, improvements, corrections and contradictions thoroughly welcome!<br><br>~<br><br>Section Four: On Thy Topics Of Discussion<br><br> <br><br>16. The PPC community thrives on discussion, and wastes away in its absence. When you post a thread on the Board, try to do so in a way that encourages discussion and interaction - and when you reply, do the same thing!<br><br><br><br>17. That doesn&#39;t mean the PPC is Serious Business! Silliness and insanity are welcome here — even encouraged. Feel free to leave your sanity at the door. Most PPCers do.<br><br> <br><br>18. On the other hand, serious discussion is ALSO welcome, nay, encouraged, here. Odd, ne? &quot;Very well, then I contradict myself, I am large, I contain multitudes.&quot;<br><br><br><br>19. Don’t worry about your interests being too eclectic for anyone else to be interested in — history has proven time and again that there probably is someone who shares your interests. And on the off chance that there isn’t, there’s somebody who wants to start!<br><br> <br><br>20. There is no Article 20.<br><br> <br><br>21. Randomness is seldom a bad thing, as long as Da Rules are followed. (For an example, see Article 20.)<br><br><br>22. Feel free to tell us all about stories, websites, news, or anything else you think will be of interest to the PPC at large. We&#39;re always in dire need of entertainment, intellectual stimulation, and good fanfic. And don&#39;t just drop us a link - wax lyrical on what you&#39;ve found, why it&#39;s interesting, and any questions it creates. Don&#39;t be afraid to quote (but don&#39;t make the quote stand in for your own words!).<br><br> <br><br>23. The PPC has always been about having a good laugh at badfic, so feel free to talk about it, and post links if you find something you think is worth sharing (but not just links... see Article 22). If there&#39;s a thread about badfic on the top half of the front page already, go ahead and add to that - otherwise, feel free to create your own! (And when replying to a thread about badfic, or reviewing a badfic, please remember Article 2!)<br><br>hS the Loquacious </p>

            <p>Net neutrality isn&#39;t fandom news, right?<br><br>I think just &#39;news&#39; might suffice - we trust the members of the PPC to have their own filters in place on what&#39;s of interest to the PPC. That gives us &#39;fiction, news, websites&#39; as the actual examples, which covers almost everything (plus salmon cannons to catch the odd things).<br><br>I&#39;m still not too happy with the &#39;on-topic&#39; language; perhaps something like &#39;If you feel something might be of interest to the PPC (...), go ahead and bring it up.&#39; That gets rid of the Board-specific language, too, which is a plus in my book.<br><br>We also have an outstanding amendment (the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nG8wOXMgwMpLW1fxqvvR5o2EXEKTJOcjFGkWIpLkG34/edit">Harassment Amendment</a>) which is only a few votes shy of being adopted - we have six (five if we discount Desdendelle; I think Aegis is still around?), and I feel like 10-12 would be sufficient for adoption (assuming no-one objected to it). Since this one is less of a serious change, 6-8 would suffice; with broad approval from Huinesoron, Thoth, Tomash, and Neshomeh, we&#39;re already halfway there.<br><br>Once no-one&#39;s trying to edit this draft any more, and once the flurry of people actually posting has settled down, I&#39;ll throw both up to the top of the Board for discussion and ratification.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I agree with 10-12 as a general thing, but in this case we&#39;re basically looking at a minor tweak - the Constitution <i>already</i> says this, we&#39;re just removing language that suggests posting is discouraged, and streamlining the structure.

            <p>From what I&#39;ve read, there are already lawsuits in the works challenging the decision. While agencies do have the authority to revoke previously-established rules, they cannot be &quot;arbitrary and capricious&quot; about it. Hopefully, the courts will put a preliminary injunction in place so that the repeal doesn&#39;t take effect until it gets argued in the courts. If they were quick enough to put a preliminary injunction on Trump&#39;s travel bans, they should <i>definitely</i> issue one here.<br><br>Though a Congressional fix would render any litigation moot, I wouldn&#39;t hold my breath that our divided Congress would move any more quickly than usual. If anything, they&#39;ll move at a turtle&#39;s pace instead of their usual glacial pace.</p>

            <p>So, since Thoth and I realized we might not be the only two people who care about this, here&#39;s a link to the <a href="https://adventofcode.com/">Advent of Code</a>. It&#39;s a series of 24 two-part programming puzzles that go up once per day in, well, Advent. The puzzles aren&#39;t ever, but can be more or less challenging depending on background, which programming language you happened to pick for that one, and so on.<br><br>Unfortunately, I can&#39;t travel back in time and start a thread for solutions and discussion that goes to the first, but one can start now.<br><br>I suppose I should make clear that posts containing solutions should be marked, and the solution should either be linked from offsite, spoiler-blocked past visibility, or rot13&#39;d, as they&#39;re spoilers.<br><br>Is anyone else participating I don&#39;t know about?

TXR is a scripting tool developed by Kaz Kylheku, aka kazinator, aka that guy who never shuts up about TXR on HN.<br><br>Credit to him, TXR is a really awesome tool. The associated Lisp dialect is basically CL with a lot of built-in functions and shortcuts and a few semantic changes to make it more convenient for scripting. It also has wrappers for all the POSIX stuff you could ever want.

            <p><a href="https://pastebin.com/Bvf137gv">The solution.</a><br><br>I do have to admit to cheating slightly here. My original, much more naive solution was running (and running, and running), and so I wandered onto Reddit. On the advent of code subreddit, I saw an offhand mention of svaqvat n plpyr (I think it might have been in a title, not sure), which inspired the current, way faster, solution.<br><br>- Tomash</p>

            <p>So, thought about it. And then I said, &quot;no. I won&#39;t do it. #define-generated functions are way too complicated a direction to go, it&#39;s a bad idea.&quot;<br><br>...So 15 minutes later, I&#39;m reading the docs for preprocessor macros...<br><br>I also changed some other things: `long int` is `long` now (as per... C99, I think?), some things got put in functions, and `init<em>gens` got inlined at its one callsite, as did `compare</em>gens`.<br><br>The result is much shorter, and (arguably) cleaner. Although the inlining may be questionable: <a href="https://pastebin.com/B4Ttjvn4"><a href="https://pastebin.com/B4Ttjvn4">https://pastebin.com/B4Ttjvn4</a></a><br><br>...So then, I figured, what the hell, let&#39;s golf it.<br><br>Every line in the following as 80 chars or less. Really. I swear. It follows basically the same logic as the other version, just with no affordances for readability: <a href="https://pastebin.com/kWqsbuKe"><a href="https://pastebin.com/kWqsbuKe">https://pastebin.com/kWqsbuKe</a></a><br><br>I am a monster...</p>

            <p>After reading the PPC Census, I saw a recommendation (to make the PPC better) from someone to put in a weekly (or bi-weekly/every other week, memory is fuzzy) writing prompt. And, I think that&#39;s a really good idea!<br><br>The &#39;every other week&#39; writing prompt would help Newbies and Peeps Without Permission to get into the habit of writing and hone their skills. Furthermore, it would give people who already have Permission a reason to write (could help with writer&#39;s block!)<br><br>I think this should be implemented. Your thoughts?</p>

Young children are scared and cling to Simon for heat and comfort, but Simon can only feel a calming drowsiness.<br><br>&quot;Abang! Abang!&quot; Simon is jolted.<br><br>&quot;What, budak?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Abang, I&#39;m bored.&quot;<br><br>Forming his right hand into a claw, Simon clasps his brother&#39;s head lightly and rock it back and forth slightly. &quot;Can&#39;t you see I am daydreaming, Damian?&quot;<br><br>The boy chuckles as his head bobbed around. &quot;Abang, I want to play computer.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Father says not to, if lightning hits electronics, it will ruin them.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Can I play your handphone please? Please, please, please?&quot;<br><br>Simon sighs. The phone is at 80%. &quot;Alright, wait.&quot; He moves his thumb, swiping the screen windows one way and other. After deleting his browsing history, he hands the phone over.<br><br>&quot;Tonight, do homework you understand. Don&#39;t make Mom take away my handphone. If she does, I am going to eat all your cakes.&quot;<br><br>Damian shrieks in &#39;horror&#39;, then runs away to play Angry Birds. <br><br>After a few hours, the rain slows down to a drizzle. It is afternoon, and Simon grunts as he rises from the sofa. Damian is already asleep, the phone placed safely on his study table. Damian opens Whatsapp. His fingers taps the phone screen lightly, measuring his words.<br><br>&quot;Celestine, what you doing?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Why? Wanna dating, issit?&quot;<br><br>&quot;No, just checking bah!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Bah, don&#39;t just check only, visitlah some time!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Your bapa&#39; so scary, looks like eating people.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Your fault, you don&#39;t bring him durian!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Where got durian this year?

My brother sick, can&#39;t wash plates.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Babai.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Babai.&quot;<br><br>Damian smiles as he opens the app for Maybank. He looks at the amount in his bank. RM 30 000. Hopefully Celestine&#39;s father isn&#39;t the type to do grand weddings and hosts a thousand relatives, friends, and clients. <br><br>This is it. He will propose this week.<br><br><br><br></p>

            <p>The emotional mood of this story is powerful throughout the whole thing.  Even though I only guessed the Notary as being the Time Lord before the end.  (Haven&#39;t read enough of Lola to be able to recognize her speaking voice.)  But the simultaneous yearning for the other character on both parts, and the firm, almost <i>careful</i> refusal on the part on of the Notary, are incredibly expressive and powerful.<br><br>Even though it&#39;s all dialogue, the scene breaks, and the clear fact that these exchanges don&#39;t follow together as a single conversation, also get across the vast gulf of time between these moments.  The first one, with the single line, becomes incredibly cold in retrospect, as it  seems like the first time Lola broached the subject, and that the Notary just straight up shut it down with a one-line denial.<br><br>—doctorlit, trying to come up with his own story now</p>

Their creators, the Scaesh, built them to be cogitators - biological computers to act as pilots for their starships, guiding their great vessels across the void with micron precision. Their species grew ever more familiar with the universe, but could never reach out and touch it; their bulk was such that the gravity of a world would cause them to collapse in on themselves, and that was how the Scaesh disposed of them when the poor travellers had outlived their usefulness. It was as much a warning and a threat as anything else; stay in line or be cast out to bleed and break.<br><br>&quot;With most races, that would be the end of it - bio-slaves dissolved when the empires that made them fell and disappeared into memory. Not so with these. The Scaesh built things to <i>last</i>, and their orbital habitats around worlds and suns are rightly famous. But their technology could not save them, in the end, from hubris; they abandoned physical bodies to live in cyberspaces of their own creation, and once the last had done so, the Jennotari found themselves with no more masters, save the congregations in their long, wide memories. The gravity on the habitats was recalibrated, and as the Scaesh died, the Jennotari were reborn. They designed much about themselves after that, engineering complex filter-feeding systems that allowed them to sap moisture and nutrients from the air, the waters, and the land around them with every step. They developed art and culture, and they slowly designed gravitic compensators - like the inertial dampers on a conventional warp drive - so that they could walk on the surfaces of planets and honour the long-lost in their own way.<br><br>&quot;They are tender giants, ancient and ever-living, wandering vagrants and gentle protectors. They will not be roused to violence by anything save slavers, but should a slavemaster come to a Jennotari world, they will not leave it. That is their mission now, now that their masters are dead and gone, now that the Scaesh worlds themselves are relics. They live, and love, and are free.&quot;<br><br>-- Ceemeh N&#39;gra Ceshospa, asteroid miner and slave-freer.</p>

            <p>((Thanks to Delta for letting me borrow Grace.))<br><br>Charlotte tilted her head back, feeling snowflakes settle on her cheeks before melting into tiny droplets. &quot;It&#39;s still strange,&quot; she commented, looking at Ix, who was hunched in her many layers of coats and sweatshirts. &quot;I&#39;m not used to the cold affecting me.&quot;<br><br>Ix&#39;s teeth could only chatter in reply. Snow clung to her hat and dripped down the front of her shirt; she&#39;d taken a snowball right to the face during their earlier snowball fight and it was starting to take its toll on her.<br><br>Charlotte grinned. &quot;Alright, we&#39;ve seen enough of the courtyard; want to go get cocoa?&quot; She checked her watch surreptitiously; the timing couldn&#39;t have been better.<br><br>Ix grinned and nodded, and Charlotte looped her arm through Ix&#39;s. They shuffled through the snow and back to the door; once inside, they stomped their feet to remove the last clinging flakes before setting off in a random direction. Despite their frozen hands, they pulled their gloves off, intertwining their fingers as they walked.<br><br>When they entered Rudi&#39;s, the pub was strangely empty. The only person inside was the bartender, Grace, who already had two steaming mugs of cocoa ready on the bar. She gave the agents a knowing smile before disappearing into the kitchen.<br><br>Ix looked around, at the dim lighting, the candles flickering on the tables, and Charlotte&#39;s face. Though Charlotte&#39;s pale cheeks were already flushed from the cold, a hint of embarrassment was beginning to creep up to her ears.<br><br>&quot;Lottie,&quot; she said slowly, &quot;what&#39;s going on?&quot;<br><br>Charlotte picked up the two steaming mugs and carried them over to a table draped with a dark red cloth. She set them down before hurrying to pull a chair out for Ix.<br><br>&quot;Lottie—&quot;<br><br>&quot;Here, sit,&quot; Charlotte said, gesturing to the chair. Ix sat, looking up at Charlotte curiously. <br><br>Charlotte took one of Ix&#39;s hands between her own. &quot;Faolan Saibhir,&quot; she said slowly, careful to get the pronunciation right. &quot;I have something very important I&#39;d like to ask you.&quot;<br><br>Ix&#39;s heart was in her mouth as Charlotte slowly sank to one knee, reaching into her pocket. Her eyes went wide and she let go of Ix&#39;s hand. &quot;Oh god.&quot; She began patting herself down frantically, tearing her coat off and shaking it, turning pockets inside-out. &quot;I lost the ring!&quot;<br><br>With shaking hands, Ix pulled her wand from her belt and flicked it. &quot;<i>Accio ring.</i>&quot;<br><br>She and Charlotte looked at each other, equal looks of sheepish, nervous excitement on their faces as they waited. After a very, very long minute, the box came zooming into Ix&#39;s hand and she passed it over to Charlotte, who laughed and opened it to reveal a wide tungsten band engraved with a lover&#39;s knot.<br><br>&quot;Faolan Saibhir,&quot; Charlotte said again, &quot;will you marry me?&quot;<br><br>Ix slid down to the floor so she was level with Charlotte, and cupped her face in her hands. They kissed, the box slipping out of Charlotte&#39;s hands as she wrapped her arms around Ix&#39;s neck.<br><br>&quot;Yes,&quot; Ix whispered, finally pulling away.</p>

            <p>Just very sweet!  I like how slow and calm and quiet this is, compared to the other prompts.

            <p>I called this turning out to be a dream before I finished reading it, but I didn&#39;t expect it to be a dream of real events.  Everything seemed to be going so perfectly and easily for Daichi (headband aside) that I didn&#39;t believe it could be real.  Makes the ending even more of a surprise, firstly that it really did happen, and secondly for the sudden dark mood of Daichi&#39;s present.  I&#39;m not quite sure why it&#39;s driving Daichi to drink, considering it was such a nice, calm dream, but maybe not all the dreams of his past he&#39;s having are so nice?<br><br>—doctorlit, whiplashed</p>

            <p>((This is unbeta&#39;d and possibly slightly sadder than the other prompts. I&#39;m sorry.))<br><br>&quot;You OK?&quot; Cinnabar asked as she entered her RC. Theo was sitting on the edge of his bed, staring at a holoprojector that Cinnabar had never seen in the room before. <br><br>Not looking away from the scene playing on the holoprojector Theo shook his head. &quot;You know how I said my left eye records just about everything I see?&quot; <br><br>&quot;Yeah.&quot; Cinnabar replied as she moved around both Theo and the holoprojector to sit next to her partner, as she did so she noticed Theo had been crying, a rare thing for the Mandalorian Cyborg. <br><br>&quot;Well, there are special times that I&#39;m able to keep. When I was still in my &#39;verse some of my crew used to edit the recordings so that it was more like a third person video than just a first person view from my eye.&quot; Theo explained, still watching the scene. &quot;And of all of those scenes, this one...&quot; He broke down crying again, unable to finish his sentence. <br><br>Cinnabar looked at the holoprojector, the scene showed two figures, one obviously Theo and another, from what Cinnabar could remember a Zabrak Force user, staring out across a beautiful world, rolling green fields and hills gave way to snow-capped mountains in the background. Turning her attention back to the two figures Cinnabar saw, and heard, Theo kneeling down, a ring appearing from one of the compartments in his gauntlet as he said &quot;Pariya, will you marry me?&quot;<br><br>The force user, Pariya, looked down and smiled. &quot;You are aware it is highly unusual for a Jedi to marry, especially to someone who works for the Empire?&quot;<br><br>Theo, in the video, chuckled. &quot;Since when have you been a usual Jedi?&quot;<br><br>Pariya laughed. &quot;That is very much true.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Well?&quot; <br><br>Cinnabar almost jumped as the line was said twice, almost in perfect sync. Once was by the slightly worried, but still happy Theo in the video and the other was from a much sadder voice in real life. Turning from her thoughts to the video she realised she&#39;d missed part of this Pariya&#39;s response.<br><br>&quot;-course you dolt. Stuff those uppity Jedi Masters back on Tython. I&#39;ll happily marry you.&quot;<br><br>The video cut back to the beginning, just two figures standing at the edge of a grand complex of buildings admiring the view. Cinnabar looked at Theo. &quot;You really were married?&quot; She asked, despite already knowing the answer.<br><br>Theo&#39;s vision broke away from the video and he stared at Cinnabar. &quot;Yes. Today would have been our tenth anniversary.&quot;<br><br>((Fin.))</p>

            <p>((So since I&#39;ve written the original prompt, I&#39;ve wanted to write a almost-companion piece to it. And, well, here it is for your enjoyment unbeta&#39;d, but hopefully not unloved.))<br><br>Pariya looked over the view before her. The rolling green plains of Alderaan were dotted with the occasional animal but thankfully this bit had been, so far anyway, untouched by the civil war, while the snow capped mountains rose up in the distance. Here on the balcony the sounds of the rebuilding works were quietened, making it an ideal spot for the Zabrak Jedi to meditate whenever she visited Alderaan and House Teral in particular. <br><br>Her current meditations were broken off by the sound of a ship coming to land at the small spaceport House Teral had set up, mostly for the construction efforts. This ship however carried an altogether different cargo, six of what Pariya knew to be the best Bounty Hunters in the business, and it was because of one of them that she was here today. <br><br>Theo was not surprised that she was already waiting for him as he arrived on the balcony, &quot;I am sorry for my lateness your Jedi Master-ness.&quot; he said sarcastically. &quot;And I have important news for you.&quot; This second sentence was said with a bit more seriousness. <br><br>&quot;Oh?&quot; Pariya asked as she leaned into Theo for a kiss. &quot;While I do love seeing you again, as I enjoy all our time together, I must ask if Alderaan is really the best place for this. You know the trouble we could get in if one of the lesser royals decides to talk.&quot; She snuggled slightly into the Mandalorian&#39;s grasp, wrapping his arms around her as she did so.<br><br>&quot;They won&#39;t.&quot; Theo assured her, resting his chin on the back of her head, carefully avoiding the horns. &quot;But I asked to meet you here because I know you prefer it to our normal rendezvous&#39;s, especially Hoth and Tatooine.&quot;<br><br>&quot;That&#39;s true. So what is it that&#39;s so important?&quot; Pariya asked, as Theo extricated himself from her, so that he was now standing by her side.<br><br>Taking a deep breath, Theo looked once again at Pariya, a smile creeping onto his face as he studied her face yet again. With a swift movement he got down onto one knee, one of the spare ammo compartments in his gauntlet popping open to deposit a ring into his hand. Holding the ring up to her Theo asked. &quot;Pariya, will you marry me?&quot;<br><br>Pariya gasped in shock before looking down at Theo and smiled. &quot;You are aware it is highly unusual for a Jedi to marry, especially to someone who works for the Empire?&quot;<br><br>Theo chuckled and shrugged his shoulders. &quot;Since when have you been a usual Jedi?&quot;<br><br>Pariya laughed in response, before looking back down at Theo, a large grin on her face. &quot;That is very much true...&quot; She trailed off.<br><br>&quot;Well?&quot; Theo asked, slightly worried although hoping that the look on Pariya&#39;s face meant he didn&#39;t have to be. <br><br>&quot;What do you think? Of course you dolt.&quot; Pariya replied, still smiling and sounding over the moon. &quot;Stuff those uppity Jedi Masters back on Tython. I&#39;ll happily marry you.&quot; With that she enveloped Theo in a hug, momentarily forgetting that he was still kneeling down and letting out a little squeal as they both tumbled to the ground. <br><br>((Fin.))<br> <br>((Tried to make it so that you don&#39;t have to look up any Star Wars stuff to really enjoy the piece, but at the same time knowledge of Star Wars, and the Old republic in particular can give you extra pieces of insight into the piece. I was originally going to include a little bit at the end involving the crew of Theo&#39;s ship, however I felt it took away from the rest of piece and would potentially require wiki-diving to fully understand it so I removed it.))<br><br></p>

            <p>Ah, a different take on the prompt.  Very interesting.  I like both the &quot;original&quot; as a straightforward proposal scene with the hint of foreshadowing by mentioning that it takes place on Alderaan, as well as the &quot;flashforward&quot; version where we see the emotional aftermath.  The recording eye gives Cinnabar the chance to experience the flashback in the same time as the reader, letting our reactions parallel each other.<br><br>One thing that does feel like a discrepancy is when Pariya, in the second story, says she doesn&#39;t want to be seen together.  She says this right after kissing Theo, and right before drawing him into a hug.  I suspect you <i>meant</i> for this to be contradictory, with her actions giving the lie to her words, but it still felt a little too blatantly off to me.<br><br>—doctorlit, putting off any diplomatic missions to Alderaan any time soon</p>

            <p>With regards to Pariya&#39;s actions, you&#39;re right. The reason she says that is because they&#39;re both fairly influential figures on opposites sides of the war, so not only are they meant to be trying to kill each other if they see each other, they also have a lot at stake to lose if they&#39;re relationship is found out. They&#39;ve both agreed that it is worth the risks, but normally they try and minimise the risks as much as possible, a relatively open meeting like this is a lot more risky than all the other meetings they&#39;ve had since the war broke out (again).<br><br>Nova</p>

            <p>...fussing over details, doing, undoing, and redoing her work until she was satisfied. Sonia put down her hairbrush and examined her reflection. Her long brown hair, normally tied up in a messy bun, was braided to perfection and fell over her left shoulder. Her riding tunic was impeccably clean and her armour had been polished to a mirror shine. Her riding boots were also waxed to perfection— polished to the point where she could almost see her reflection in them. She then applied a tiny bit of perfume to her neck and sat up straighter. <br><br>She looked as if she had just stepped out of a royal family portrait. Perfect.<br><br>The Pegasus Knight then grabbed the little velvet case resting on her vanity and gently opened it. A beautiful silver ring glinted back at her in the soft light of her bedroom. She and Harris had been seeing each other for years, now. They had grown closer with every passing day despite being somewhat hostile to each other the first time they had met. She grew to know him... like him... and love him. Oh, she could go on and on about him: enthusiastic, charming, gentle, well-spoken, polite— if spectacularly maladroit at times. He had opened up to her and she to him; Sonia could not imagine a day without seeing him now. <br><br>She stood up, pocketed the case, and took a deep breath. Gods, this was difficult. She knew his answer already— so why was this so nerve-wracking...?<br><br>Sonia had barely stepped into the RC’s living room when Harris burst through the door and skid to a halt when he saw her. <br><br>“Harris?”<br><br>“I, uh.” He did a very poor job at concealing the wooden box he was holding. “S-Sonia! I didn’t expect to see you, uh. Here. Now.”<br><br>“In our RC?”<br><br>“Uh...” He swallowed nervously. “Y-you look beautiful, Sonia... um... are we planning something tonight?”<br><br>It was the Pegasus Knight’s turn to gulp nervously. “I... wanted to discuss something extremely important.” She noticed his hands tighten around the box he was carrying. Could it be...? Regardless. She had practiced for this moment. Sonia approached Harris and took out the velvet case. “Harris Frost,” she said slowly as to keep the shaking out of her voice, “I have been at your side for well over six years now... and you, at mine. We’re already close— and I would like to make us closer.” She slowly bent down to one knee and presented the case to Harris, fighting back the sudden urge to run away. “Will you marry me?” <br><br>There. It was done.<br><br>“I— I was...” Harris also got to his knees and brusquely opened his box. A gold ring slipped out and clattered to the floor. “I was going to propose too...” he said hastily, quickly snatching up the ring before it could roll away. He held up the ring, offering it to her. “Sonia, yes. With all my heart, yes. I— I made you this ring... like, all by myself... Will you...?”<br><br>“Harris, I...” Sonia stared at the ring, then at Harris’ earnest face. “Yes.”<br><br>She threw her arms around him and pulled him close.<br><br>---<br><br>(Just de-lurking for a moment to post a response. I couldn&#39;t resist. <br><br>Laters!)</p>

            <p>Dawn woke up slowly. She was warm, at first, but then the aches set in: her head, her shoulder, both her knees, even one of her hands--she wasn&#39;t sure how it had happened, but she wanted the warmth back. Groaning, she curled up--ouch, no, why--and tried to fall back asleep.<br><br>&quot;You&#39;re awake,&quot; observed a familiar voice. Dawn groaned again and pulled the covers over her head--which left her calves exposed to the chill in the air. What? &quot;Good. We should leave soon.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Why&#39;re my blankets short?&quot; Dawn asked. She didn&#39;t care that it came out slurred; she wasn&#39;t about to put more effort into moving her jaw than was absolutely necessary. No way. &quot;M&#39;cold.&quot;<br><br>&quot;They are shock blankets from the <i>USS Enterprise,</i>&quot; T&#39;Zar replied. Her voice went just the tiniest bit dry as she continued, &quot;You cut them in half last month to make a poncho.&quot;<br><br>Dawn remembered that. It was the warmest poncho she&#39;d ever had. Completely worth it, apart from how cold her feet were getting.<br><br>There was no way she was getting back to sleep now. Dawn turned onto her back, redistributing the (very, very orange) blanket and trying to convince herself to sit up.<br><br>Mission. They were on a mission. It wasn&#39;t even on an ice planet, despite the chill, but Dawn could remember falling the day before, rolling--<br><br>She grimaced and sat up, tucking the blanket around her. &quot;You did pretty much everything to set us up yesterday, didn&#39;t you? Camp, and that? The blanket?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yes,&quot; replied T&#39;Zar, and Dawn remembered T&#39;Zar supporting her down the hills, setting up a makeshift camp without complaint, convincing Dawn (pretty easily) to lie down in the middle of it, even wrapping the blanket around her and--to Dawn&#39;s great amusement--using a phaser to heat up rocks for further warmth. Nothing like an actual TOS Vulcan mimicking Sulu&#39;s TOS moves to bring back Dawn&#39;s thoughts of how awesome this partnership was, even five months in.<br><br>Now T&#39;Zar held out a cup. &quot;Hot tea,&quot; she explained, and waited patiently for Dawn to untangle a hand so she could take it. &quot;There is also oatmeal and pancakes, and I succeeded in finding the honey jar you believed lost.&quot;<br><br>Dawn rested the camping mug against her knee and stared at T&#39;Zar, only looking away to spot the pancakes--apparently reheated from the stock Dawn had made...was it only two days ago? <i>Was</i> it even two days ago?--and the oatmeal, still dry in the jar.<br><br>&quot;Marry me,&quot; she said fervently. Well, she thought it was going to be fervently, inasmuch as she&#39;d thought about it at all before she&#39;d said it; in practice, she sounded tired and a little plaintive. Also a bit hoarse--well, she&#39;d talked a <i>lot</i> yesterday.<br><br>The Vulcan froze, more obviously startled than Dawn had seen before, and then one of her eyebrows ticked up. &quot;I...had not thought you interested. Moreover, you are not a Vulcan; while Vulcan-alien marriages have occurred, they remain extremely rare--&quot;<br><br>&quot;Whoa, hey, whoa.&quot; Dawn reluctantly freed her other hand to rub at her eyes. &quot;Slow down. A lot.&quot;<br><br>T&#39;Zar closed her mouth, but her gaze remained intense.<br><br>&quot;I&#39;m, I&#39;m not, I mean--&quot; Dawn took a breath, inhaling steam from her tea--hm, rosehip--and let it out slowly, trying to gather her thoughts. &quot;It&#39;s...it&#39;s an expression. The way I used it. I don&#39;t actually say it much, but--it really is an expression.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Explain.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Uh--&quot; Dawn frowned, cupping her hands around the mug in an attempt to keep them warm. &quot;It&#39;s...like, when someone&#39;s really grateful, or they&#39;ve been surprised with something good? So they say &#39;marry me&#39; as kind of...kind of like saying &#39;I think you&#39;re really, really amazing right now&#39;? Something like that. I don&#39;t normally say it, but I&#39;ve been seeing it around, so...And, I mean, you&#39;re <i>really awesome</i> right now. So. But I&#39;m not actually looking to get married right now, and I&#39;d definitely want some dating first. A lot of dating. Serious dating.&quot; Dawn caught up to her words and made a face. &quot;I&#39;m just going to...stop talking about this now, okay? Except to add that I&#39;m actually only sixteen, which for my time period and culture is <i>way</i> too young to get married. Really.&quot;<br><br>&quot;...ah.&quot; T&#39;Zar considered it, then nodded. &quot;I...appreciate your presence as well. Drink your tea,&quot; she added when the human only gaped at her. &quot;We must leave within the next thirty-four minutes.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Uh-huh,&quot; Dawn said intelligently, and began convincing her arms to lift.<br><br>*<br><br>Six years later, T&#39;Zar redirected her obnoxiously energetic current partner out the door of the RC with the reminder of some task to be done, and turned back in time to see her former partner sit down heavily with a sigh of relief.<br><br>&quot;Marry me,&quot; the human said once she had let her head loll back against the couch.<br><br>T&#39;Zar raised an eyebrow, mostly for effect. &quot;I appreciate the sentiment, Dawn, as I did the other four times you asked, but I am disinclined to acquiesce to your request at this juncture.&quot;<br><br>Dawn raised her head again, startled delight spreading across her face; then, she burst into laughter that didn&#39;t stop until she was out of breath.<br><br>&quot;Never change,&quot; she told T&#39;Zar once she could speak again. &quot;You&#39;re <i>amazing</i>.&quot;<br><br>It was probably illogical to feel so pleased over causing such a large outburst of emotion; even so, T&#39;Zar didn&#39;t prevent the slight uptick of the corners of her mouth.<br><br>Life among humans was rife with illogic, but after a decade in the PPC, T&#39;Zar had almost grown accustomed. Visible hints of emotion seemed a small price to pay to ease relationships and prevent large displays of negative emotions.<br><br>It was only logical.<br><br><br><br><br>---<br>(Unedited, unbetaed, finished very late in the day, but hopefully a fun read! ~Z)</p>

            <p>I like the presentation of Vulcan emotions, and the source of the misunderstanding.  I also like the time skip that shows how T&#39;Zar has grown more used to human idioms and behavior over time.<br><br>What&#39;s particularly well done is how you presented Dawn&#39;s injuries in the opening scene, explaining it to us with details spread here and there throughout that scene.  much better and more natural than simply stating that she was hurt on a mission, even without specifically saying what happened.<br><br>—doctorlit, often logical</p>

            <p>((So I took some liberties with this. Sue me, it&#39;s what popped into my head. Concrit is appreciated!))<br><br>The Aviator paced in circles around his TARDIS&#39; controls, goggles dangling from his left hand. In his right, he held a piece of paper covered in sprawling Circular Gallifreyan, scrawled hastily and crossed out many times.<br><br>&quot;I&#39;ve known you for ten years now,&quot; he muttered, running his fingers through his hair. &quot;And I know that&#39;s not very long, but we&#39;ve been through a lot together and I think it&#39;s time we...

I thought you two were...&quot; She trailed off and gestured vaguely.<br><br>&quot;It&#39;s not just any surprise, Elanor.&quot; The Aviator reached into his pocket and produced a small box. <br><br>Elanor&#39;s mouth fell open and she looked up at the Aviator, eyes wide. &quot;YOU&#39;RE GONNA ASK HIM TO—&quot;<br><br>&quot;Shh!&quot; the Aviator hissed, looking around frantically for signs of Zeb. The last thing he wanted was for his partner to overhear and spoil everything.<br><br>&quot;I&#39;m gonna get a dad?!&quot; Elanor whispered, beginning to bounce in place.<br><br>&quot;Maybe, Ellie, maybe,&quot; the Aviator said. &quot;The Detective is... well. You know what he&#39;s like.&quot;<br><br>&quot;But he loves you,&quot; Elanor said, folding her arms. &quot;And you love him. Right?&quot;<br><br>The Aviator looked up at the ceiling, as if searching for the right words written among the tangle of cables. &quot;I mean—&quot;<br><br>&quot;Right?&quot; Elanor repeated.<br><br>&quot;Right,&quot; the Aviator said, &quot;but it&#39;s not that simple. Life&#39;s not a fairy tale where as long as you&#39;re in love, everything will be okay. Both people have to be compatible, both have to want the same things out of life, and... while Dee&#39;s talked about the possibility of us making it official, he&#39;s been hurt in the past. We both have.&quot;<br><br>Elanor pulled away to sit on the chair facing the navigation panel, putting her feet up on the Aviator&#39;s knees. &quot;Well, why not just ask him?&quot; she said. &quot;Not like you haven&#39;t talked about it before, right?&quot;<br><br>The Aviator crossed his arms uncomfortably. &quot;Elanor, I appreciate you trying to help, but this is something I have to figure out for myself, alright?&quot;<br><br>Elanor&#39;s face fell, but she nodded. &quot;Alright,&quot; she said, getting up and trudging to the door. She looked back before she left. &quot;Promise I won&#39;t tell Uncle Zeb,&quot; she said with a faint smile.<br><br>&quot;Thanks, kiddo,&quot; the Aviator said, blowing her a kiss. Once she&#39;d shut the door, he let out a long string of swears, collapsing in her recently-vacated seat.<br><br>He pulled the box out of his pocket and opened it, staring glumly at the simple gold band.<br><br>The TARDIS hummed again.<br><br>&quot;I know he does, baby,&quot; the Aviator sighed, lightly touching the ring. &quot;I just gotta work up the courage first.&quot;</p>

            <p>This was cute!  A small, short scene, but I like that we get a good range of the Aviator&#39;s thoughts on the matter, and that he&#39;s getting support from both Elanor and the TARDIS.  I&#39;m also amused by Elanor&#39;s excitement over getting a dad, especially since it goes against the stereotype of kids not liking their step-parent in fiction.<br><br>—doctorlit, promising not to tell Zeb</p>

            <p>Finch&#39;s optical sensor narrowed and glared over at Bingle in a new kind of disgust. <br><br>&#39;<b>This is one of the stupidest ideas you-ve ever had.</b>&#39;<br><br>&#39;Alright, then, Finch,&#39; said Bingle, narrowing his own eyes, nodding, looking down at a sheet of paper in his hands. <br><br>&#39;Will you marry me with knowledge of the benefits of, ahem:&#39; he raised the sheet up to his face, glanced at Finch from behind it, and continued reading. &#39;An extra day off per annum, permission to an RC of slightly larger than usual size, a free &quot;do not disturb&quot; sign, and - and - a single, guaranteed free cake for the wedding.&#39; He looked over at it, raised an eyebrow at Finch. <br><br>&#39;<b>Bingle, <i>no</i>.</b>&#39;<br><br>&#39;Free cake, Finch, for absolutely no price at all!&#39; Bingle exclaimed, waving the sheet in Finch&#39;s optical sensor. &#39;That costs absolutely, literally no money, at all! In the most literal sense possible! Zero!&#39; <br><br>&#39;<b>I had bloody figured that,</b>&#39; Finch hissed, shoving the sheet away. <br><br>Bingle shook his head and folded his arms and dramatically raised his eyebrows. &#39;Free cake, Finch. It might be chocolate, or even maybe have some form of ice cream or other dessert on it!&#39; <br><br>&#39;<b>Why do you keep emphasising the cake? I can-t even <i>eat</i>.</b>&#39;<br><br>&#39;Oh, it&#39;s not <i>just</i> cake.&#39;<br><br>Finch pointed at Bingle, at his sheet, with an actuator. His optical sensor twisted and twirled as he said: &#39;<b>You know, Bingle, there are lots of people out there for whom marriage is a very important event of deep religious meaning, with real spiritual consequences and relevance. You-re really bloody degrading them, right now.</b>&#39;<br><br>&#39;Finch, I have absolutely no idea what you mean by that, and that is mainly because I was paying you no attention at all because I was thinking of all the benefits - free benefits - like cake - free cake - we could get just by entering a legally binding marriage for the rest of our lives or until our relationship degrades into apathy and occasional violent bursts of arguing and we commit an inevitable divorce, tearing a great schism between our once peaceful families.&#39; <br><br>&#39;<b>No! That is so - that is so bloody dumb!</b>&#39; Finch ran an actuator down his optical sensor. &#39;<b>You always come up with incredibly horrible ideas like this, and then you always try and drag me into them!</b>&#39; <br><br>Bingle wrapped his hands together and thought deeply. &#39;I suppose you will be saying no.&#39; <br><br>&#39;<b>No! Ask someone else!</b>&#39; <br><br>&#39;Maybe I just will.&#39;<br><br>&#39;<b>Okay!</b>&#39;<br><br>&#39;And we&#39;ll enjoy it.&#39;<br><br>&#39;<b>Good!</b>&#39;<br><br>&#39;That free cake and those benefits, all for free. We&#39;ll love it.&#39;<br><br>&#39;<b>I bloody hope you do.</b>&#39; <br><br>&#39;Okay, then,&#39; Bingle said, eyes dramatically narrowed, stepping backwards down the hall. &#39;You&#39;ll regret not taking me up on this, you know.&#39;<br><br>&#39;<b>No, I won-t.</b>&#39;<br><br>Bingle&#39;s slow shake of his head suggested that, yes, Finch <i>would</i> regret not taking him up on that. <br><br><br><br>Bingle returned and Finch didn&#39;t regret a single thing. Bingle walked over, heavily sat down, back arched. He looked like he had been crumpled up and thrown away. His eye did not just look black; it looked lopsided. <br><br>&#39;<b>DMS, right?</b>&#39;<br><br>Bingle nodded.<br><br>&#39;<b>Already married, right?</b>&#39;<br><br>&#39;Very married. Also, I suspect she was some form of... dragon. Or minotaur, perhaps.&#39; He reached around his mouth, feeling for any remaining teeth. &#39;Either way, she was capable of both fire-breathing <i>and</i> goring.&#39; <br><br>&#39;<b>Right out of a dramatic mission where their relationship was put to its very limits, right?</b>&#39;<br><br>&#39;The Ironic Overpower hasn&#39;t liked me very much today, Finch.&#39; <br><br>&#39;<b>It hasn-t.</b>&#39;<br><br>&#39;You know, in my defence, out of all the doors I knocked, I was only beaten up <i>once</i>.&#39;<br><br>Bingle exhaled, Finch groaned.<br><br>&#39;<b>If you <i>really</i> want to bloody try it,</b>&#39; said Finch, a claw on his optical sensor. &#39;<b>I will do it. Because we-re friends. And I pity you. And I-m sure that cake is bloody delicious.</b>&#39;<br><br>Bingle glanced at Finch. &#39;Really?&#39;<br><br>Finch glanced right back, behind that claw. &#39;<b>Sure, Bingle</b>.&#39;<br><br>&#39;You know,&#39; said Bingle, heftily propping himself against the wall and looking at the corner between the wall and the ceiling. &#39;Now that I think of it, knocking on the doors of multitudinous people I&#39;ve never met before to ask if they wanted to get married for cheap benefits wasn&#39;t even a very good idea, was it?&#39;<br><br>&#39;<b>I can-t believe I suggested something like that.</b>&#39;<br><br>Bingle nodded and said: &#39;You really ought to be more responsible, you know.&#39; </p>

            <p>and am also not a Flower. <br><br>I sort of wrote this with the distinct idea of twisting the prompt into creating something that was as unromantic, non-sentimental as possible, with a bunch of characters I made to be as non-shippable as possible. <br>Maybe it wasn&#39;t <i>entirely</i> free of sentiment, but that was more directed at the loyalty between the two fellows, and I do certainly personally idealise loyalty and comradeship above romantic lovey hug-time. <br><br>I&#39;m glad that you enjoyed their voices - I do consider dialogue and characterisation to be my better areas within writing, and I&#39;m just plain happy that managed to sort of stick out, there. <br><br>But, ey, cheers for the review, ey?</p>

            <p>((Probably not canon. Who knows if I&#39;ll ever do anything with these characters? Thank you to Caliope for betaing.))<br><br>Farah Tahar and Kk&#39;kttak arrived in their new RC within a few minutes of each other. Neither of them had been were happy about this turn of events, as could be seen from the near-growled &quot;<em>You</em>&quot; they&#39;d greeted each other with. Fortunately, Farah had figured out that she could separate the bed and found the second set of bedding before Kk&#39;kttak had arrived, which averted the possibility of having to sleep anywhere near <em>him</em>.<br><br>The newly-minted agents spent the next few hours wandering in and out of the RC, getting books, food, weapons, and anything else that might come in handy that they hadn&#39;t picked up in their month or so in Headquarters. They rather carefully stuck to a near-nonverbally arranged split of the RC and its storage space (Farah got the half nearest the door). After they&#39;d finished their shopping, Farah and Kk&#39;kttak both settled in and started reading. Farah was making sure to face away from Kk&#39;kttak, ignoring him aggressively. Kk&#39;kttak followed suit for a while, since he didn&#39;t want to start anything, even though he thought Farah was being insane.<br><br>About two books later, it was rather obvious Farah wasn&#39;t going to make the first move here, so Kk&#39;kttak spoke up.<br><br>&quot;You. Hani,&quot; he said.<br><br>Farah turned her head and glared. &quot;Yes, <em>kif</em>?&quot;<br><br>&quot;The Flower-princes have given us a duty. I could do without worrying about revenges and status-games. Will you marry me?&quot;<br><br>Farah&#39;s mouth froze open, and she took a moment to process that. &quot;Did you ask &#39;Will you marry me&#39;?&quot; she finally asked.<br><br>&quot;What? No! I didn&#39;t propose ... how would that even work?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Rephrase the question.&quot; Farah said, and added a muttered &quot;This gods-rotted translator...&quot;<br><br>&quot;Would you accept a long-term partnership with me?&quot; Kk&#39;kttak said slowly, making sure of each word.<br><br>Farah shook her head. &quot;Not clearer,&quot; she commented. &quot;I know some main-kifish. I&#39;ll turn the translator off for a moment. Then I&#39;ll need both phrasings.&quot;<br><br>Kk&#39;kttak nodded. &quot;Very well.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Translator off next two sentences,&quot; Farah said at her flashpatch.<br><br>She then paid close attention to the series of mainly clicks and taps that came out of Kk&#39;kttak&#39;s throat. She recognized the words, except for the important one, the word her translator kept tripping up on. She had, however, encountered the root in the kif term for &quot;central clearing&quot;.<br><br>The status markers were also not ones she&#39;d ever heard. They seemed derived from &quot;-[to an equal]&quot;, but what were those extra clicks for? They usually meant &quot;esteemed&quot;, which acted to indicate somewhat higher relative status than usual, but how did that make any sense here?<br><br>Then it hit her. That was probably meant to be something like the form of address for a fellow crewmember ... the way the term was understood on, say, hani ships, not kif ones. Maybe he <em>had</em> actually learned something about how other species thought like she’d been told. No wonder the translator had been having fits! Coinages tended to throw even these very advanced ones off, evidently.<br><br>After that, she turned to puzzling out what &quot;partnership&quot; might have been. She started pacing back and forth across her side of the room, turning the word and anything reasonably related over in her throat the best she could. A few minutes later, she&#39;d guessed that something like &quot;collaboration&quot; might have been a good translation, and decided to test her theory.<br><br>&quot;You,&quot; she said to get Kk&#39;kttak&#39;s attention.<br><br>&quot;Yes?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Would two ships agreeing to jointly pirate anyone small who flies by and split the loot be a &#39;long-term partnership&#39;?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Of course.&quot;<br><br>&quot;So what you want is that we work together and don&#39;t try to kill each other or one-up each other to the Flowers?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yes. Mirrad-[learned one] said this was how most agents worked.&quot;<br><br>Farah hmphed. &quot;<em>Most agents</em> didn&#39;t blow up my ship.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Your ship also destroyed mine.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Your ship <em>started</em> it, you <em>pirate</em>!&quot; Farah howled, claws shooting out from her fingertips.<br><br>&quot;It is our way, and was mine,&quot; Kk&#39;kttak said, holding up his empty hands in the traditional gesture of placation.<br><br>Farah took a few deep breaths and willed her claws back in. They would, she reminded herself, probably only going to be working together until she explained the situation to the Flowers. She probably shouldn&#39;t ruin her chances by getting arrested for beating her new partner to a pulp, no matter how satisfying it would be.<br><br>She still wasn&#39;t quite sure how to respond to the offer, and so she went with a phrase she&#39;d heard several times from kif comms, including as the closing on the last transmission before <em>Tahar&#39;s Ambition</em> was blown to bits a tenth of a light-minute from Meetpoint dock. &quot;I will consider your status,&quot; she said slowly, reproducing the sounds of an alien language as well as she could with her different anatomy.<br><br>She turned back to her reading, restoring the earlier atmosphere of the RC.<br><br>Then, as an afterthought, she looked up. &quot;Tahar out,&quot; she added curtly, in hani this time.<br><br>It seemed fitting.<br><br>(( - Tomash ))</p>

            <p>I like how you play with the alien languages here, both in the physical pronunciation, and in how the translator attempts to present figures of speech from it.  I also like that the pre-existing conflict between the two agents isn&#39;t spelled out right away, but sets the mood throughout the whole piece nonetheless.<br><br>I could have done with physical descriptions of both agents, since neither seems human, and I don&#39;t know what they&#39;re from.<br><br>—doctorlit, going to review all of these, hopefully</p>

            <p>I&#39;m glad you liked what I did with the languages. Interspecies communication issues are a thing I like reading about, and it&#39;s nice to see that I&#39;ve managed to pull it off.<br><br>It&#39;s also good that I managed to get a general mood of conflict going, since I wanted that so the &quot;proposal&quot; would seem way out of left field in a potentially-funny way.<br><br>You have a point about the lack of description. If/when I go back and edit this, I should find a good spot to add some (para 1. could use a long sentence&#39;s worth of physical descriptions.)<br><br>Yes, neither agent is human. They&#39;re both from the Chanurverse, which is <i>technically</i> part of the Alliance-Union &#39;verse (but not tightly integrated), all by C.J. Cherryh. Quick summary off the top of my head: Farah is roughly an antropomorphic lion and wearing some sort of loose trousers (probably in black because PPC), and Kk&#39;kttak  has a rat-like face, a very thin throat, smells somewhat of amonia, and already had rather concealing black robes when he got here.<br><br>- Tomash</p>

            <p>How many prompts would it be, you reckon? I recall, Seaturtle tried this before, and he sort of, sent out a small splattering of prompts, for more choice and all. Maybe that&#39;d be interesting, and I don&#39;t think it would entirely ruin the idea, if the central concept is just &#39;get people writing&#39;. Maybe all the prompts could be <i>themed</i>, if we want to be cute. Could ask a couple people around for prompts or such if that&#39;s the case.

            <p>A while back there was even a prompt game going on, where people could basically request prompts and be given them, whereupon they&#39;d write a short or not-so-short scene that filled it. It was really fun, and that&#39;s actually how I reached my NaNo goal this year--I asked Ix to give me prompts and aimed to write a double drabble or so for each. I actually have a whole Gdoc full of prompt fills I did from back when we first did this; it&#39;s a really, really great way to indulge yourself with AUs, ships that are never going to sail in canon but would be fun to explore, scenelets that wouldn&#39;t normally get written, character building with new characters, scenarios that you probably shouldn&#39;t fit into your agents&#39; canon even if they could somewhat plausibly fit within the PPC setting...pretty much anything, really.<br><br>My actual point with this? Yeah, I support the idea of writing prompts, even a less writer-specific version (which, well, at that point you get to see what different people do with the same prompt...which also happened sometimes during the prompt game, actually. And happens with the n-monthly concrit thread, come to think of it). Let&#39;s do it! Do you have a prompt, Mr. Sprinkles? Since you&#39;ve brought it up?<br><br>(Actually, have we met? I feel like you&#39;re part of the influx of recent-ish newbies. In which case, welcome to the Board! Have a belated Welcome Gift. It&#39;s in this pastry box, and is probably pastry of some kind.

            <p>Hello, everybody.  As some of you may be aware, I am a semi-professional Magic: the Gathering player in what used to be my free time.  Well, I decided that I still had too much free time and decided to write a blog about the game, as well.<br><br>I post twice a month, usually bringing new decks or exploring old decks.  I hope to start doing Magic story articles in the new year.  I won&#39;t be doing re-caps of the official story, since that is a thing other content creators already do well.  I will, instead be doing character/plot analysis and evidence-based theory-crafting.<br><br>So, if any of that interests you, or if you just want to see what all of the (as of yet non-existent) fuss is about, check it out.<br><br><a href="https://badmoonmtg.wordpress.com">BEHOLD!</a><br><br>-Phobos, aka BadMoonMTG</p>

            <p>From what little I have read from your blog, I have a handful of gripes. Make of them what you will.<br><br>First, the resolution of your thumbnail images is poor for their size. I would recommend using card art instead of the entire card. You should be able to find high quality scans on artist websites.<br><br>Second, please center your card images. This is just an aesthetic preference. I find having everything skew to the left to be a bit of a headache.<br><br>As for your decks, I feel your Baron Von Count deck is a bit lacking. Almost the entire deck is packed with cards that are meant to trigger your commander&#39;s ability. Most of these cards do very little for you otherwise. This deck should carry more control spells. Adding removal cards like Dismember (gets 1,3,and 5!), board wipes like Breath of Darigaaz (1,2,and 4) and Void (garbage, but on-theme), and draw like  Bloodgift Demon (1,3,4, and 5) or Erebos (1,2,3, and 5, rather expensive) would benefit your deck.</p>

            <p>1) Can&#39;t argue with that.  I use the card art straight from Wizards for the images.  I&#39;m not sure I would feel right using high-res images off an artist&#39;s website.  Usually you have to pay for that stuff, and I am just not there at this point.<br><br>2) I tried to make that happen.  I drove myself crazy for a full weekend once trying to get the site to look how I wanted it to.  I failed.  Wordpress is pretty terrible for customizing formatting.<br><br>3) Much of what I put into the Baron Von Count deck is just there to trigger the ability, that is true.  However, most of it doubles as a fair defense for a low cost, while not presenting much of a threat to other players (meaning they might leave me alone to set up).  That said, Dismember and Breath of Darigaaz would be excellent additions.  Bloodgift Demon is more expensive than I am willing to put into the deck, but what you might do can be completely different than what I&#39;ve proposed.<br><br>Anyway, thanks for taking the time to comment.  It means a lot.<br><br>-Phobos</p>

            <p>... this isn&#39;t something I&#39;ve ever done. I think part of that is that I don&#39;t listen to all that much music anyway, but there&#39;s also that I&#39;m far too easily influenced by it - I have /how/ many stories inspired by Heather Dale now? So listening to songs while writing would be a good way to get massive tonal shifts every few paragraphs. ^_^<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I listen to a whole lot of music. Alternative/indie stuff, mostly; though I do like Taylor Swift. However, I listen to albums as a whole, not individual songs. <br><br>Hmm... I think the best album for writing happy stuff is Grace VanderWaal&#39;s <i>Just the Beginning</i>. The best angsty pop album is either <i>Pure Heroine</i> by Lorde or <i>Somewhere in Between</i> by Verite, and the best angsty rock album (in my opinion) is <i>Everything this Way</i> by Walking on Cars. The best album for when you just need something catchy but relaxing is definitely <i>Nocturnal</i> by Yuna. And the best all-purpose album is Ingrid Michaelson&#39;s <i>It Doesn&#39;t Have to Make Sense</i>.<br><br>I hope that&#39;s helpful!</p>

            <p>Back in college, when I was writing essays or my pre-PPC fanfiction, I would listen to just about anything when I wrote.  Getting into the PPC more, I switched to mostly soundtrack-only music, as lyrics were too distracting.<br><br>As my work schedule picked up, it got to the point where I could only get writing done on my non-keeper work shifts, where I obviously couldn&#39;t have music playing.  And now that I&#39;m a full-time keeper, my writing rate has slowed to the point where this question is largely irrelevant, sadly.  :(<br><br>—doctorlit, pretty much just working, getting ready for work, and sleeping for most of each week now</p>

            <p>Mainly on Pandora these days.<br><br>The first is built around the <i>Skyrim</i> soundtrack and also features a lot of the <i>Assassin&#39;s Creed</i> soundtrack, plus assorted other similar stuff. It&#39;s low key, but the occasional exciting rhythmic bits mean it&#39;s not low energy. This is a pretty good general purpose one.<br><br>The second is built on the group Afro-Celt Sound System. Lots of rhythm here, a little electronic/trance-ish stuff, but not too much. Very global feel. I used this one a lot when writing &quot;The Cabin.&quot; Take that as you will. &gt;.&gt;<br><br>The third is basically classical music—Mozart, Vivaldi, etc. Though somehow <i>Skyrim</i> tries to sneak in there, too, which was really annoying when I wanted something to work by that <i>didn&#39;t</i> make me wish I was writing fanfic instead.<br><br>I can&#39;t use anything with vocals unless I don&#39;t understand the words, and even then, it has to be a voice I like; otherwise it&#39;s too distracting. Though it is nice to be distracted by something I like to sing along with every now and then. <i>Dovakiin, Dovakiin, naal ok zin los vahriin, Wah dein vokul mahfaeraak ahst vaal...</i><br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

Doesn&#39;t that feel better? ;) Oddly, the thing that&#39;s really drawing my eye here is the lightly-sketched log Derik is sitting on; I really like the design of it, even though I can barely see it.<br><br>#5: Henry is adorable; I want to ruffle his hair. I love the way his t-shirt is riding up as he raises his hand - it&#39;s a nice little detail. I feel like the top itself is slightly wrong, though - the straight line up to his arm suggests it&#39;s being pulled tight, but then it&#39;s all rumpled at the sleeve? He ends up looking like he has a giant shoulder blade pushing it out, which I&#39;m assuming isn&#39;t the case. ^_^<br><br>Old Henry for some reason looks alarmingly like Dobby? Dunno what&#39;s with that.<br><br>#6: Woof! I founna woof! :D I think you&#39;re right about the head - if she pointed it in a straight line from her neck, it would be &#39;narrower&#39; than the neck. The tail is lovely, though, and (weird detail time again) the &#39;flame&#39; lines are perfectly simple and perfectly placed.<br><br>hS</h1>

            <p>Kaede, I know what the problem is - you haven&#39;t actually written any words, Kaede. I don&#39;t know what alphabet you use, but I&#39;m pretty sure those aren&#39;t it. ^_~<br><br>Obviously, I love the pose - it&#39;s extremely evocative (unless you were aiming for something else...). The simplicity of the shape of the head is also nice - and the hair shows good consistency with the other Kaede image.<br><br>I do feel like there&#39;s something wrong with your angles, though. The sheet of paper doesn&#39;t seem to be in the same perspective as the room itself, and I&#39;m positive that the light coming through the window can&#39;t show that shadow from the pen pot. I do like the variable sharpness of the shadows, though - they are, correctly, sharper when they&#39;re closer to the object casting them.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve equivocated for a while on what to say about this, because the first thing that jumps out at me is a bit weird: the &#39;after&#39; picture comes over as distinctly more feminine than the &#39;before&#39;.<br><br>I think the reason for that is that &#39;after&#39; is far, far more curved: the hair in front of the face contrasts with the cuts/cheekbones on &#39;before&#39;. I&#39;m also looking at the right (my right) ear, which is curved to match the left on &#39;after&#39;. Also the... eyelids, I guess? The way they curve down along the nose gives a distinctly feminine impression, while &#39;before&#39; implies a flat brow-ridge. (The neck, too...)<br><br>The other thing that&#39;s reaching out and grabbing me is the nose on &#39;before&#39;; it&#39;s almost exactly the same shape as the one on &#39;after&#39;, but the slightest variation in the thickness of the lines makes it clear that it&#39;s differently angled. I&#39;m impressed.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>A) Well, that was sort of an unintentional effect. I was meaning to imply undernourishment/stress with perhaps a bonier face in the &#39;before&#39;.

            <p>Ok, first off, you really improved a lot since the first entry. The shading is done nicely, not overdone, and in the right places. The legs are drawn nicely and well proportioned, I particularly like the shading since it captures the light source quite well. i also really like the shading for the face, it gives the face a nice contour.<br><br>Now, improvements, I&#39;m going to nitpick here since this is probably the last time I&#39;m critiquing your art unless you decide to make more art threads in the future. First, the clothes. You did add folds, which are nice, but now the folds themselves are the problem. Your folds don&#39;t really  fold, they are just lines. You didn&#39;t make what I call fold bumps on the outline of the clothes. While you could get away with that usually, it&#39;s still a good idea to draw some, usually where the cloth is being compressed. Also, keep in mind folds appear both when the cloth is being compressed and stretched, and careful not to overdo the folds. <br>Next, the hands. These are pretty well structured compared to your previous sketches, a bit of an issue with the left hand is that the fingers seem a little too short.  <br>The hair is a bit iffy here, I can see strands, which is nice, but there is too much crisscrossing. It lacks flow. Yes, hair is not always perfectly parallel, but this seems like you tried too hard to make each strand go in a unique direction. This is actually the opposite problem to the folds; for the folds, there wasn&#39;t enough detail, for the hair, you placed too much.<br><br>Overall, the sketch itself is pretty well structured, and well drawn. However, it could benefit from improving the fine details, but be careful not to overdo the details. A good mantra to follow is &quot;art is suggestion, not replication&quot;. All you need to do is suggest the details are there by placing a couple of details, enough for the viewer to notice, but not too much as to clutter up the sketch. <br><br>P.S. You seemed to have switched the left and right feet.(^ _ ^) </p>

            <p>I really like the designs for the outfits, they all seem to fit quite nicely. There is one thing I would like to point out, the cloth seems really stiff. There are no folds at all even at the elbows. Also, the lower parts of the dresses should have some kind of folding as well, because it&#39;s loose. I see that you did place some folds on the right picture, but folds should go up to the point of support. Oh and about the faces, different angles create different shapes for the face. If you wanted to use the exact same pose but with different face angles, I suggest using a circle as a placeholder, then adding the jaw according to the angle you want the face to be in.</p>

            <p>You did a great job making the outfits feel distinct, yet very Kaitlyn—I can get the sense that all four of them would definitely be worn by the same person. I like the little details like the pouches, chainmail, necklaces... Will you design my next Ren fair costume for me? :P<br><br>Really, my only critique is that her left foot (our right) looks oddly arched in the middle. I&#39;d make it a bit flatter and bring the toes more up, if that makes sense?</p>

            <p>The pouches and pockets were Kaitlyn&#39;s idea; she has Opinions about pockets on women&#39;s clothing.<br><br>As to the foot: yeah, it would.

            <p>Everybody looks pretty great here. I love the kiss. No idea what it&#39;s based on, but it looks natural and not like their faces are trying to merge, which is always a plus. ^_^<br><br>I&#39;mma critique the hands this time, because there are so many of them in this picture, and they all look a bit boneless. Hands are hard, no two ways about it, and subtle little changes in the line make all the difference. The fingers should widen a little at the second knuckle, then taper toward the tip. (The third knuckle is probably not prominent enough to worry about.) The more they&#39;re bent, the more the crease on the inside of the joints will become prominent—if the sides/insides of the fingers are visible, this really helps make them look more 3D.<br><br>The first joint of the thumb also tends to stand out a bit, just above the wrist, and gives the base of the hand a square look (unless it&#39;s tucked in). Remember the thumb has three segments, just like the fingers, but it&#39;s set lower and the first segment is joined to the palm by muscle and skin. When relaxed, it tends to curve inward, not stick straight out. When fully extended, the third segment (of the fingers, too) can actually curve outward a bit—at least, mine do, especially the thumb and first finger.<br><br>All this subtle stuff adds up to make a believable hand. Drives me nuts, but at the same time I kinda love it. {= )<br><br>~Neshomeh, who has kinda stalled out on drawing, but will hopefully be able to catch up after cookie-making is over.</p>

Huh, almost twelve hours ago. Aaaanyways, I figured that was pretty fun, and I only got up to chapter four out of... twenty? It&#39;s too dark to tell. So! I decided to continue this... idiocy?

            <p>I like that Spensor is an Autobot with terrible combat skills and a silly transformed form.  Those facts, as well as his personality and speaking mannerisms, makes for a funny contrast with the canon.

            <p>So, we haven&#39;t had a thread in a few days, and I was recently reminded of a video I saw once, that I think people should watch. It&#39;s kind of old, so you may have seen it already, but I figured why not share.<br><br>Warning, this video can evoke some pretty strong emotions. Most people I know have cried while watching it.

            <p>Because I did watch that, too, just didn&#39;t have time to comment before.<br><br>I also didn&#39;t cry, but that&#39;s only because I was eating breakfast at the time, and then I had to go to work and not be a mess.

            <p>Okay, so.  Making an effort to do more, longer-content posts on the Board.  Time is limited for me, but I have to try.  I feel like my job is pulling me away from my number-one hobby, and I don&#39;t like it.  From here on out, I intend to try to write something about every piece of fiction I consume, and hopefully inspire a discussion thread as a result.<br><br>Anyway.  <i>Star Wars</i>.  I saw it yesterday with my mom and brother, and the following will essentially be my unfiltered, initial impressions, as I haven&#39;t yet watched or read any reviews online.  Here is the official <b>SPOILER WARNING</b> for not only <i>The Last Jedi</i>, but probably for at least some aspects of the other seven films, as well.  And I&#39;m potentially spoiling <b>everything</b> so please, go no further if you haven&#39;t watched yet.<br><br>Also, I don&#39;t have all the new character and planet names memorized yet, so forgive me for being vague about any of those.  And for rambling.  It will be mostly rambling.<br><br>I think this was the best-written and best-plotted <i>Star Wars</i> to date.  It&#39;s far more character-motivated than any of the others by far.  The inevitable consequence of this is that <i>Last Jedi</i> finally does what I feel Lucas was trying to communicate about the setting all along, particularly in the prequel trilogy, but wasn&#39;t quite able to due to his poor writing ability: make <i>Star Wars</i> morality not black-and-white.  And to make the message even more powerful, that it&#39;s delivered primarily through Luke Skywalker, a character that pop culture has viewed for decades as one of the most generic golden-boy good guys.  It was a little shocking to see him criticizing the Jedi order, but also kind of <i>freeing</i>, when it comes down to it.  To me, this says (finally) that it&#39;s not the side you say you&#39;re on, not the face value colors you wear, but the things you do with the abilities you possess.  The film plays with this in so many ways, both subtle and obvious.  Luke&#39;s lack of regard for the past Jedi institutions, while focusing his training of Rey on simply studying and understanding the Force itself, is a big part of it.  Rey herself also supports this theme, overtly being called by the natural Dark Side cave on the island, and sometimes having some darkly utilitarian thoughts (&quot;The Force is something the Jedi use to control people and . . . and move things.&quot;), while very clearly having &quot;good&quot; goals in defeating Snoke and keeping the Resistance alive.<br><br>Kylo Ren has become a much more interesting villain to me this time around.  The film makers did an incredible job of setting up his turn to the Light Side, making him interact with Rey throughout the movie, having such heartfelt and honest discussions with her, and . . . man, it was such a stirring scene for me when he offed Snoke and stood back-to-back with Rey to fight off the Knights of Ren!  And of course, the ending of <i>Return of the Jedi</i> set us all up to expect Kylo to join the Light . . . so what a depressing let-down right afterwards, when he takes control of the First Order and continues the attack on the Resistance!  But it makes Kylo a more believable villain for me.  Most of the past <i>Star Wars</i> villains, particularly Palpatine and Maul, were basically motivated by their belief systems, acting in the name of the Sith religion for purely abstract reasons.  I like that Kylo rejects all that came before, acting in the name of his own desires.  I hope things stay that way in Episode IX, now that he has essentially ended the Sith as we&#39;ve known it so far.  It also makes him an unexpected mirror to Luke, since during this film they both more or less literally burn down the legacies of the established faiths they once represented.<br><br>Slight side note from there: I love that after all the fan theories about Snoke&#39;s identity and significance to past SW history, he just gets killed off with no real revelations or examination of him here.  What a great red herring!  Incidentally, now that I&#39;ve seen him in non-hologram form and heard him speak more, I <i>do</i> think he was Palpatine after all.  I can easily see the texture of his skin and the mutilation of the left side of his face being results of the electrocution and fall Palpatine took at the end of RotJ, and his voice frequently takes on the same growling timber of the Emperor&#39;s <s>sexy</s> voice.  But as I said, it really doesn&#39;t matter any more, and I&#39;m okay with that.<br><br>One major, ongoing weakness that this film shares with the entire rest of the series is that we still don&#39;t have a reasonable explanation behind the politics in the conflict.  Like, the prequel trilogy remains the most solid politics explanation so far, and that primarily only worked because Palpatine stood to gain so much in a dictatorship because <i>he</i> got to be the dictator.  I suppose Snoke&#39;s motivation in starting the First Order was probably similar, but I can&#39;t understand why General Hux and the rest of the storm trooper regimens are so dedicated to wiping out the Senate and the Resistance, when they&#39;re essentially nothing but grunts.  In <i>The Force Awakens</i>, Hux gave that grand speech about wiping out chaos and imposing order, but that&#39;s just philosophy.  I want to really know <i>why</i> Hux and company think a dictatorship is the best, most efficient, most productive way to run the galaxy.  I want to know what problems were either being caused by, or not being addressed by, the Republic Senate that justified obliterating seven planets&#39; worth of sentient people.  I think the non-Force using Empire/Order side of the conflict in SW is unavoidably going to feel rather cardboard until we start to understand their viewpoint better.  But again, hopefully Kylo&#39;s turning away from &quot;identity politics&quot; in this film will allow more room for development of a real purpose to the First Order in future films.<br><br>Finally, Yoda.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZGDlhgAxV8">Yo-yo-yo-yo-yoda!</a>  His appearance was just such an absolute pleasure.  Frank Oz&#39;s performance follows along from the ones in <i>Empire Strikes Back</i> and <i>Return of the Jedi</i>, complete with the return to the puppet, rather than the CGI used for <i>Attack of the Clones</i> and <i>Revenge of the Sith</i>.  Even admitting that the puppet technology really doesn&#39;t look that good in the current age of film, it <i>felt</i> good, it <i>felt</i> right, to know that in the final moment of that scene, Mark Hamill and the Yoda puppet were actually leaning against each other, and that it wasn&#39;t something just added in post.  It also fits that the puppet form of the original trilogy is Yoda&#39;s &quot;defining&quot; point in time from which Yoda appears as a ghost, as I feel that even Yoda was being influenced by the decadence of the Jedi order during the events of the prequel trilogy (even he couldn&#39;t see beyond the veil of darkness Palpatine was cloaked in), and that his time on Dagobah was truly the time of his greatest enlightenment under the Force.  Following from this, and tying into my earlier point about not equating &quot;Light Side&quot; with &quot;Jedi&quot; and &quot;Dark Side&quot; with &quot;Sith,&quot; Yoda is even the one who follows up on Luke&#39;s desire to wipe out the old Jedi codes and laws by immolating them, even using natural lightning to do so—an excellent Light Side use to parallel the long-established use of lightning as an attack by Dark Side users.  For a scene that contains a lightning bolt and small forest fire, it&#39;s such a peaceful, comforting scene.  Very well done!<br><br>Finally, some minor stuff.  I like the guinea pig-birds as fine and funny SW-feeling background decoration, but disliked the crystal canines, as they looked a bit too much like a <i>World of Warcraft</i> monster, even though they actually had a storyline purpose.  However, I <i>loved</i> the planet the crystal canines lived on, though.  I first saw that planet, and I was like, &quot;Oh, an all-ice world, like Hoth.&quot;  But then, it turns out to be <i>salt</i>!  A planet whose geology is primarily salt!  That&#39;s so original, and made for some great visuals during that battle sequence, especially in the underground caves later on.  It might even account for the stupid appearance of the crystal canines, if the crystals in their fur are partly due to salt being incorporated into their biology.  I found the hologram cameo from Maz to be pretty unnecessary and tacked-on, especially since Rose came from the planet Maz directed her group to anyway.  Seems like she could have just known about the master hacker guy herself, and saved the movie an entire scene.  The scene in the casino was great.  It had all the creativity of past &quot;cantinas&quot; in both set and character design, but felt noticeably different from any setting we&#39;ve seen in SW so far.  It also put the overly clean and shiny aesthetic of the prequel trilogy to much more appropriate use.  I probably don&#39;t even have to point out that the heroes rescuing the hippogriff-looking animals that were being abused for sport gave me all kinds of happy feels quite beyond the ones being invoked by watching a new SW movie.  I especially love that the animals escape by trashing the casino, where the money raised off betting on them was being spent.  And the final sequence involving Luke was perfect in every way.<br><br>—doctorlit calls it: Episode IX will have Hayden Christensen appear as Anakin&#39;s Force ghost, and it will be amazing<br><br>Here are some spoiler lines for use in discussion posts, to keep spoilers out of the automatically generated previews:<br><br>&quot;They hate that spoiler.&quot; &quot;They hate that spoiler.&quot; &quot;They hate that spoiler.&quot; &quot;They hate that spoiler.&quot; &quot;They hate that spoiler.&quot; &quot;They hate that spoiler.&quot; &quot;They hate that spoiler.&quot; &quot;They hate that spoiler.&quot; &quot;They hate that spoiler.&quot; &quot;They hate that spoiler.&quot; &quot;They hate that spoiler.&quot; &quot;They hate that spoiler.&quot; &quot;They hate that spoiler.&quot; &quot;They hate that spoiler.&quot; &quot;They hate that spoiler.&quot; &quot;They hate that spoiler.&quot; &quot;They hate that spoiler.&quot; &quot;They hate that spoiler.&quot; &quot;They hate that spoiler.&quot; &quot;They hate that spoiler.&quot; &quot;They hate that spoiler.&quot; &quot;They hate that spoiler.&quot; &quot;They hate that spoiler.&quot; &quot;They hate that spoiler.&quot; &quot;They hate that spoiler.&quot; &quot;They hate that spoiler.&quot; &quot;They hate that spoiler.&quot; &quot;They hate that spoiler.&quot; &quot;They hate that spoiler.&quot; &quot;They hate that spoiler.&quot; &quot;They hate that spoiler.&quot; &quot;They hate that spoiler.&quot; &quot;They hate that spoiler.&quot; &quot;They hate that spoiler.&quot; &quot;They hate that spoiler.&quot; &quot;They hate that spoiler.&quot; &quot;They hate that spoiler.&quot; &quot;They hate that spoiler.&quot; &quot;They hate that spoiler.&quot; &quot;They hate that spoiler.&quot; &quot;They hate that spoiler.&quot; &quot;They hate that spoiler.&quot; &quot;They hate that spoiler.&quot; &quot;They hate that spoiler.&quot; &quot;They hate that spoiler.&quot; &quot;They hate that spoiler.&quot; &quot;They hate that spoiler.&quot; &quot;They hate that spoiler.&quot; &quot;They hate that spoiler.&quot; &quot;They hate that spoiler.&quot; &quot;They hate that spoiler.&quot; &quot;They hate that spoiler.&quot; &quot;They hate that spoiler.&quot; &quot;They hate that spoiler.&quot; &quot;They hate that spoiler.&quot; &quot;They hate that spoiler.&quot; &quot;They hate that spoiler.&quot; &quot;They hate that spoiler.&quot; &quot;They hate that spoiler.&quot; &quot;They hate that spoiler.&quot; &quot;They hate that spoiler.&quot; &quot;They hate that spoiler.&quot; &quot;They hate that spoiler.&quot; &quot;They hate that spoiler.&quot; &quot;They hate that spoiler.&quot; &quot;They hate that spoiler.&quot; &quot;They hate that spoiler.&quot;</p>

            <p>So, I got out of Star Wars an hour or so ago, and I have a few opinions.<br><br>I liked:<br>- The complex, less black-and-white storyline<br>  - That still ended on a high note<br>- The lack-of-sound and several mostly-snapshots effect. That was a neat thing<br>- The fact that they managed to make it feel like the movie was over several times, only to &quot;but wait, there&#39;s more&quot; me<br>- The porgs. They were cute<br><br>I didn&#39;t like:<br>- The fact that they didn&#39;t go with Poe/Finn.

The grayer view on the Force and the Jedi is something I always appreciate, especially when you remember the way Jedi are supposed to work before Order 66 (Fan of KotORs and the Old Republic in general speaking). And I always felt like &#39;Euh, so the perfect Jedi is a droid?&#39; and &#39;How Anakin is the only one Jedi snapping? That way of doing things just breed darksiders&#39;. Good to see that questioning brought up in the movies, beyond the &#39;meta&#39; we can see with Luke mocking the idea he&#39;s a Deus Ex Machina, especially when we remember so many people prefered Han over him in the original trilogy.<br><br>I also like the general &#39;Reality Ensues&#39; attached to the Resistance and so many points of the movie. Heroes and desperate plans don&#39;t always save the day, not all scoundrels have the nobless of becoming Han Solo, defeating the superweapon or killing their leader doesn&#39;t mean the enemy is done... The lesson of &#39;sometimes the only possible victory is living long enough to fight again later&#39; is also a good one point to bring out too.<br><br>And frankly, I like the way Kylo offed Snoke. We know the dark side is a way laced with treachery, where apprentices kill their masters to take their power... Actually seeing it happen successfully (for once) feels impressive, and the fight scene with the guards after that certainly don&#39;t spoil anything. Having him stay on the dark side feels perfect here too, the idea he could have turned back to the light here would have been so cheap.<br><br>Also really liked the scene were they used Yoda the puppet. It&#39;s so precious, fun, awesome, and the essage he delivers he&#39;s the right one at the moment.<br><br>And I don&#39;t see why some people on the web are saalty bout the way Luke dies. First, the projection thing? <s>Legends</s>Expanded Universe had Force illusions, and if a Jedi can create one of a Super Star Destroyer, or some darksiders the illusion of more warships in a fleet, why not this? And the idea it overetends Luke and costs him his life isn&#39;t far-fetched or anything to me. And as a small OT, don&#39;t see that much of a problem with the critters Porg. Sure, they&#39;re clearly there to make plushies, but they appear seconds at most in a row, except when they distract Chewie. I can get over them.<br><br>All in all, I liked that movie, and I&#39;m curious about where they&#39;ll go with the next ones.<br><br>... Yes, the scene with Leia and the vacuum felt a bit ridiculious. I wonder where she got enough of a Force training for pulling that off. Still not spoiling the movie for me.</p>

I also liked that, like the question of grey morality among the Jedi, they didn&#39;t try to paint heroics as black-and-white either.  Poe got rightly condemned for losing so many lives to take out a scary ship, delaying an evacuation in the process.  But Vice Admiral Holdo actually uses a suicide tactic later on, this time for the sake of saving lives and giving an evacuation more time to continue.  It&#39;s a movie that asks you to weigh your options before acting.<br><br>—doctorlit, amused by &quot;the perfect Jedi is a droid&quot;</p>

            <p>(Post gets more spoilery as it goes.)<br><br>There were a lot of moments that were really awesome, but there were also a lot of moments that left me confused or just felt like blatant manipulation, telling me how to feel. All storytelling is manipulation, but I shouldn&#39;t be aware that it&#39;s happening. {= P<br><br>Part of the problem is that the characters don&#39;t feel fully realized to me, and I&#39;ve had this problem with pretty much everything J.J. Abrams has touched that I&#39;m aware of. (So, <i>Star Wars</i> and <i>Star Trek</i>. &gt;.&gt; ) The film moves along at such a clip that we don&#39;t get to spend a lot of time just being with these people, seeing them be themselves. We never get a scene like the one on the <i>Falcon</i> in <i>A New Hope</i>, with Obi-Wan teaching Luke how to use the lightsaber, discussing the Force, with Han Solo commenting in the background. It&#39;s a beautiful, quiet scene that shows us who these people are in their hearts: brash, headstrong Luke, philosophical Obi-Wan, and pragmatic Han. It also gives us more information about the Force, which we need at that point. It stays precisely as long as it needs to to get the job done, and the story moves forward.<br><br>There were times that really tried to happen in this one. I liked the scenes between Rey and Kylo, though I would have liked to see them sharing the screen more. I think I understand why they did it they way they did, but not seeing the actors playing off each other, if they even did, takes something away from them. I spent a lot of time thinking about whether Adam Driver&#39;s voice really sounds like that and the perpetual mournful look in his eyes. What&#39;s up with that? Does he really feel that way, or is it all part of manipulating Rey? I&#39;unno.<br><br>But, for the most part, it felt to me like everyone was doing things because they were supposed to, because that&#39;s their trope and/or the plot says so. Poe in particular says to me, &quot;I am this trilogy&#39;s headstrong hotshot, therefore I must doubt my superiors and rebel against them at all times.&quot; If there was anything in the previous movie to show us why, I don&#39;t remember it.<br><br>I think Finn and Rose would&#39;ve been better if they hadn&#39;t been used for the worst plan ever, which brings me to my second major issue: the logic and coherence of the plot. It was... lacking. In this instance, I&#39;m pretty sure it takes time to travel through space even at light-speed. Why in the galaxy did the writers decide it was a good idea to make these characters leave the fleet, which is (IIRC) in the middle of nowhere, fleeing for its life and perilously low on resources, to go jaunting off to some other planet god knows how far away, to go hunting for some guy who may or may not help them assuming they can even find him in the first place? This is a terrible plan, and it makes the plight of the fleet feel cheaper, and dragging in another new character to fix the problem takes away the chance for the ones we already have to do something awesome themselves. I&#39;d have liked the combination of Rose&#39;s technical expertise and Finn&#39;s familiarity with the Empire&#39;s systems to save the day. The point about people profiting off both sides of war just felt shoehorned in, too.<br><br>Not that I didn&#39;t grin a whole lot at the scene where they saved the moose-dog-horses. ... Though, I kept thinking to myself, you know they&#39;re just going to get rounded up again, and probably beaten for their trouble, so even that was pretty pointless. {= (<br><br>I don&#39;t have a problem with the new demonstrations of the Force. We&#39;ve seen Force-users sense each other&#39;s presence plenty of times before, so extending that awareness to conversation seems logical. The astral projection seems to fit in with the existence of Force ghosts, and as to why it&#39;s not done more? It seems as though the effort killed Luke. So that&#39;s a pretty good reason.<br><br>I don&#39;t think Leia was dead in space. I think she was on the brink, and at the last moment regained consciousness enough to draw herself to the ship. Or the ship to her? It doesn&#39;t matter. This isn&#39;t a new power; it&#39;s a pretty standard one. And the combination of exposure and exertion clearly cost her. I was cool with it.<br><br>That said, though, a lot of the scenes with Leia felt like blatant emotional manipulation. I know, Carrie Fisher is gone and it&#39;s sad, but just giving us Leia being awesome would&#39;ve been a fine tribute. No need to beat us over the head with the fact of her loss.<br><br>Let&#39;s see, what else... Oh, I liked Snoke once we met him, and I think his character was badly under-served. Comparing to the original trilogy again, they failed to effectively build him up as the Emperor was built up before we finally met him. The Emperor was kept in shadow until he came on the scene. We only really knew him through the respect and deference showed to him by Darth Vader. This was powerful because Darth Vader himself is respected and feared, a man who operates under his own set of rules and bows to no one—except this guy. Scary!<br><br>Snoke didn&#39;t get that. We don&#39;t particularly respect Kylo the wimpy Vader-wannabe in the first movie, and he doesn&#39;t particularly respect Snoke, either. The only mystery about this character is exactly how he worked his way into Kylo&#39;s head in the first place, and this is only made more confusing by what we learn of the story in this movie. Kylo was under Luke&#39;s care, with several other students. How did Snoke approach him? What did he say or do that was so compelling? Were we ever shown or told this? I don&#39;t know, and it&#39;s too bad, because he was a nicely charismatic bad guy. Too bad he never <i>did</i> anything.<br><br>I feel like I&#39;m coming down on the negative side of this, and maybe I am. I&#39;m not sure yet. I&#39;ll probably need another viewing or two, after rewatching <i>The Force Awakens</i> for context.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I admit I didn&#39;t really notice before you pointed it out, but you&#39;re right about the entire mission Finn and Rose went on: it&#39;s a fetch quest.  I&#39;ve been trying to come up with a way to &quot;fix&quot; it the way I would if I were editing a story, but . . . I really can&#39;t find anything.

            <p>***SPOILER TAG***<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>So my thoughts, are kind of in opposition to both of yours.  This was one of my least favorite of the series.  One of the biggest reasons my opinion is low is this was the first of the three Disney Star Wars that felt like a Disney film.  <br><br>There was way too much humor that did not really serve a purpose to me.  The first scene with Rey and Luke for instance.  And the porgs.  I hated those things.  I understand they were in it for the specific reason that the island that served as Luke&#39;s refuge was a puffin preserve and it was easier to CG over the puffins than to remove them.  But the Porg in the Falcon irritated me to no end, and the Puppy-Dog Eyes one.  They would have been fine in the background if they were kept there.  But to me they seem like an obvious marketing ploy to sell plush toys.<br><br>I also did not like Super-Leia.  The Force being able to reverse death by vacuum and save yourself.  That seemed a bit ridiculous.  Which brings me to another thing I was not a fan of.  New Force Powers, the bond Snoke created and more importantly the Astral Projection nonsense.  That&#39;s a gamebreaker, and if such a thing existed, why did someone like Yoda or Obi-wan never use it in the previous films?  I think the scene would have had way more impact with Luke&#39;s physical presence.<br><br>Which brings me to my final critic.  Luke&#39;s characterization.  I&#39;m going into exile, but let me create this map so you can find me if you need me.  You found me and need my help?  Buzz off.  I mean this was a man who was willing to surrender himself to Vader to be brought to the Emperor because he thought Vader had good in him and he did not want to put other at risk.  Who undertook a risky mission to confront Vader to save his friends.  I could understand a personality change or alteration (especially if they gave us more of Kylo Ren&#39;s fall to the darkside), but to me this felt more like a very OOC Luke.<br><br>On the plus side, I did like the development Rey had, and I like the way here character is progressing.  I also liked Kylo Ren in this movie far more than I did in Force Awakens.  He now feels like the villain he was supposed to be.  And it does make him a much more interesting character than Vader-wannabe.  <br><br>I do plan on watching it again, after I have rewatched the entire Saga to better contextualize it to see if I like it better.    </p>

            <p>I think I actually like the porgs <i>more</i> now, knowing at least some of them were covering up actual fat-bird behavior.  I&#39;m really kind of shocked that the internet-at-large seems to revile them so much, because they really don&#39;t <i>do</i> anything.  When they do get focused on, it&#39;s barely for two seconds before the movie takes over again.  The only scene that gives them longer screen time is when they&#39;re watching Chewbacca eat their kin, and even that has a plot purpose: distracting Chewbacca from seeing Luke enter the <i>Falcon</i>.  And did anyone <i>not</i> want Luke and R2-D2 from having that quiet little reunion scene together?  That was a wonderful moment! . . . Brought to us by the porgs!<br><br>And really, it&#39;s okay for there to be some cutesy stuff in <i>Star Wars</i>.  It&#39;s a pretty dang big galaxy; there&#39;s room for them.  Their design is actually fairly creative, too.  It would have been so easy to just cover up the real life sea birds with space fantasy sea birds, but the designers went <i>guinea pig</i> instead.  Guinea pigs that still nest like birds and care for young in the same way as birds (one was seen delivering food to the nestlings, so they don&#39;t have mammaries, despite their mammal-like appearance), they can even fly like birds!  I think they&#39;re fun.  <s>And less plot-intrusive than Ewoks.  Yeah, I said it!</s><br><br>On Leia . . . Honestly, I was a little angry during the moment when she appeared to have been killed off.  Especially since the ice crystals developing on her skin looked a bit CGI, I was afraid this was how the screen-writers had chosen to remove her from the trilogy.  In that moment, I felt like it was far too early to remove her from the plot, especially knowing from press releases that Carrie Fisher had contributed so much performance during filming.  So my feelings when Leia regained consciousness and reverse-Force-pushed her way back to the ship were feelings of roaring triumph and relief, and I really didn&#39;t care how contrived or silly the methods looked.  I still don&#39;t particularly care about that aspect; I&#39;m just glad we got more Leia as a result.<br><br>That said, I&#39;m actually a little furious that they killed off Admiral Ackbar.  It&#39;s not like his appearance was tied to a particular actor or anything; he could have stayed in the series FOREVER.<br><br>As for Luke, I pretty much agree with Huinesoron&#39;s assessment.  Luke had no way off the island.  I didn&#39;t catch that his door was built of X-Wing parts, but after my initial reaction of &quot;he&#39;s going to lift the X-Wing out of the water later, like Dagobah!&quot; the logic sunk in: that fighter&#39;s been underwater for years, if not decades.  And if that body of water surrounding the Jedi island (Jedisland?) is salty like an Earth ocean, the metal would be corroded.  There&#39;s pretty much zero chance it would function any more.<br><br>One small note: I agree with hS&#39;s and Neshomeh&#39;s idea that Luke died from the effort of Force-projecting himself to another planet.  It&#39;s the simpler explanation, compared to what I thought of during the movie: that all that blaster fire was psychologically harming Luke while it was hitting all around him.  There&#39;s some maybe-corroboration for this theory: He does carefully dodge all of Kylo&#39;s lightsaber thrusts during their duel, although that could also have been to keep Kylo from realizing it wasn&#39;t really Luke, to give the Resistance more time to escape.  Also, during the very first scene when Rey and Kylo are mentally linked, Rey fires a blaster at him, and Kylo seems to experience some pain.  But again, I think hS and Nesh win the Occam&#39;s razor award, here.<br><br>As for introducing new Force powers: well, they kind of have to, don&#39;t they?  If we stuck only with stuff from the previous six episodes, there wouldn&#39;t be any sense of discovery abut what the Force can do.  I mean, I still think the silliest portrayal of a Force power in the series thus far is when Darth Vader stopped Han&#39;s blaster shots at Bespin by . . . blocking them?  With his hand?  Video gamish much?  Maybe it&#39;s the same idea as Kylo stopping the blaster energy in midair in TFA, and the effects at the time couldn&#39;t manage something like that, but . . . it&#39;s pretty silly looking now.<br><br>—doctorlit cares for a two-toed sloth named Chewie, is apparently not capable of shortening Chewbacca&#39;s name any more</p>

            <p>Are we still doing spoiler blocks? I guess we are; it&#39;s a good opportunity to just ramble incoherently for a while. I certainly agree with you about the reunion - I don&#39;t think I said in my other comment, but Luke&#39;s &#39;Artoo!&#39; was the first time he genuinely sounded like Luke Skywalker again. ^_^<br><br>Now, Admiral Ackbar: in the old EU, he was written out off-screen too, dying ignominiously of old age. I&#39;m pretty sure Mon Mothma went the same way.<br><br>In fact, the EU had a nasty habit of bumping off <i>all</i> its elder statesmen in depressing ways. Pellaeon at least got to be assassinated, but Crix Madine was shot by a lunatic Hutt, Ta&#39;a Chume ended up in a coma, Jan Dodonna just got old... stars, the EU was a depressing place sometimes. (Though for my money, the most miserable death was Em Teedee, Lowbacca&#39;s translator droid... who got dropped on a ship which later crashed and incinerated him. I don&#39;t think anyone even noticed he&#39;d gone.)<br><br>Sorry, random asides aside: it is a shame we lost Admiral Ackbar so... pointlessly. I mean, he had to die to let Vice Admiral Holdo take command (btw, unrequited Holdo/Leia &#39;ship, y/n?), but we could at least have <i>seen</i> it. Unlike Warhammer, <i>Star Wars</i> isn&#39;t generally a place for &#39;anyone can die any time&#39;.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>&quot;They hate that spoiler.&quot; &quot;They hate that spoiler.&quot; &quot;They hate that spoiler.&quot; &quot;They hate that spoiler.&quot; &quot;They hate that spoiler.&quot; &quot;They hate that spoiler.&quot; &quot;They hate that spoiler.&quot; &quot;They hate that spoiler.&quot; &quot;They hate that spoiler.&quot;<br><br>(Yeah, I hilariously overestimated how much spoiler text was necessary in the initial post . . .)<br><br>But that only makes it worse!  We could have had a movie with a whole bunch of Admiral Ackbar scenes right in the middle!  That would have been amazing!  Like, no offense to Vice Admiral Holdo or her actor, just . . . I don&#39;t <i>know</i> you, Vice Admiral Holdo.  I <i>knew</i> Admiral Ackbar.  He was an old friend . . .<br><br>. . . Oh, but I just discovered the reason.  Wikipedia <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erik_Bauersfeld">says</a> Ackbar&#39;s original voice actor passed away after <i>The Force Awakens</i>.  They found another voice actor for <i>Last Jedi</i>, but maybe wanted to retire the character?  I feel like a jerk, now . . .<br><br>I do feel like there&#39;s a bit of a bias towards human characters in <i>Star Wars</i>, especially in the newer films.  I don&#39;t think Chewbacca has gotten nearly as much relative screen time in VII and VIII as he did in the original trilogy.  I know Luke, Leia and Han were always the focus, but there was still room for Chewbacca and even Ewoks to participate in battles.  And the prequels had Jar Jar and brought Chewbacca back for a bit . . . I know Jar Jar wasn&#39;t well received, but my point is that in this series set in space and filled with planets of unique, bizarre life forms, and the main movers and shakers always seem to be humans.  I realize that the CGI or makeup/puppetry for an alien character is more complex than just throwing clothes on an actor and putting them on screen, but I really would like a bit more species diversity in a series full of aliens . . .<br><br>—doctorlit just, like, doesn&#39;t <i>know</i> Vice Admiral Holdo, okay?</p>

            <p>I&#39;m gonna start by saying that I really liked the film, just as much on the second viewing as the first. I&#39;m terrible at ranking things, so I can&#39;t say whether it was &#39;the best&#39;, but I thought it was very good.<br><br>Is that enough to blot out spoilers? Ehh, probably. So: spoilers ahead!<br><br>Porgs: I was surprised they were as big a thing as they were, and I&#39;m going to agree with you that they exist to sell toys. <i>But</i>! They&#39;re also adonkable. ^<em>^<br><br>I think you&#39;ve misunderstood what happened to Leia: at no point was she dead. She got thrown out into space, then used the Force to pull herself back. She then went into a coma, because, y&#39;know, vacuum exposure. But she was never dead.<br><br>The Rey-Ben &#39;linking&#39; thing is obviously playing off the moment at the end of <i>Empire</i> where Luke reaches out to Leia - I think it was even framed the same way, with them appearing on opposite sides of the screen. It&#39;s definitely new; one assumes it&#39;s an esoteric Force technique from wherever Snoke&#39;s background is. The EU had more than enough of those (green Force lightning, anyone?).<br><br>The astral projection, though... well, I suppose Obi-Wan <i>could</i> have used it, but since it apparently results in death shortly after, I can&#39;t imagine it was worthwhile? The prequels also established that returning as a Force ghost is a technique that was only (re?)discovered recently, so this might be an offshoot of that. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s unreasonable as a power - heck, given that Luke never actually made physical contact with Kylo (he just dodges with his saber), it&#39;s actually the same thing as what Snoke did.<br><br>Incidentally, does anyone else think that Luke projected himself to Tatooine in his final moments? I&#39;m not entirely sure Ahch-To <i>has</i> two suns, and there was definite heat-haze in front of that sunset.<br><br>Coming now to Luke&#39;s characterisation... I don&#39;t think he <i>did</i> create the map for people to find him. We just rewatched <i>Force Awakens</i>, and the impression I got was that it was his <i>research</i>. The Empire had the larger part, which Luke and Artoo got hold of at some point; Luke then did his own investigations to finish off the last piece. He probably tried to destroy the &#39;missing piece&#39;, but didn&#39;t quite pull it off - hence the hunt for it before the sequels began.<br><br>So, to his character: Luke is a <i>terrible</i> teacher, y&#39;know that? I mean, we always knew it, but... seriously, just <i>awful</i>. Ahem.<br><br>What was Luke&#39;s motivation in the original trilogy? To save his friends first, and second, to become a Jedi. Afterwards, that last seems to have turned into &#39;restore the Jedi&#39;. And how did he do?<br><br>Well, on the one hand, his friends were &#39;safe&#39;: the galaxy was at peace. But on the other hand... by failing Ben Solo, he managed to comprehensively fail both of those aims. His bid to restore the Jedi had failed utterly: his students were either dead or evil. Some of those students were probably his friends (in the EU, he had several who were older than him). But moreover, he had failed both Han and Leia, by letting their son fall to the Dark Side. Heck, <i>Force Awakens</i> implies that&#39;s what broke up their marriage.<br><br>Luke &#39;the Last Jedi&#39; suggests that&#39;s when he gave up, but I don&#39;t think that&#39;s true. He went looking for (and found!) the first Jedi temple, with the ancient texts that were there. You can imagine how eagerly he read them, and what do you think he found?<br><br>Nothing. No teaching guides; no hints as to where he went wrong; no guide to rescuing students from the Dark Side. Just vague philosophising and moralistic rambles. It&#39;s significant that Luke refers to them as being part of the &#39;Jedi religion&#39;. Not science, not skill, not even order - religion. One he can no longer believe.<br><br>He cuts himself off from the Force. He meditates. He tries to communicate with the native creatures of the island. He probably clambers into the Dark Cave and gets shown something useless in the mirror (he seems to know a fair bit about it, after all). But nothing he does gives him any answers, and he just gets more and more bitter.<br><br>Then Rey shows up, with some whingy story about the Resistance being in trouble. How much does she actually say? I don&#39;t remember it being much, just &#39;Leia wants you to come back, everything&#39;s terrible&#39;. Which, yeah, Leia always wanted him to come back, but how can he face her after what he did...?<br><br>What Rey definitely <i>doesn&#39;t</i> say - because she doesn&#39;t know - is that Leia is about to <i>die</i>. So far as she knows, the Resistance is safely away, untrackable at light-speed. Her message is &#39;if you come back, we can take the fight to the enemy&#39; - not &#39;you&#39;re my only hope&#39;.<br><br>I&#39;m not sure of the timeline of the ending, but if I&#39;ve got it right, it goes like this:<br><br>-Artoo guilts Luke into caring.<br>-Luke contacts Leia, a) helping her heal, and b) finding out how bad things actually are.<br>-Luke goes to Rey - only to find her making out with the enemy (yeah, yeah, whatever).<br>-Rey turns on him and leaves.<br>-Luke sees the complete failure of the Jedi. He&#39;s failed twice at training them (he probably thinks Rey is off to join Kylo at this point), and the whole &#39;goodness and light&#39; thing is apparently gone in the galaxy.<br>-Feeling utterly betrayed by the Jedi Order, he goes to burn the tree.<br>-Yoda!<br>-Luke prepares himself for a massive feat of Force-projection, perhaps under Yoda&#39;s guidance, and for his own inevitable death.<br>-He projects himself to Crait, and we know the rest.<br><br>I don&#39;t see anything inconsistent in that timeline, or in Luke&#39;s character. As to why he didn&#39;t fly out to Crait in person... well, his X-wing is completely dead (apparently he&#39;s scavenged hull plating for his door), and the Falcon just flew off. He can&#39;t <i>get</i> to Crait... except through the Force.<br><br>Jumping now to Kylo: I think his arc is probably the (a) core of the trilogy. He started out by wanting to live up to his grandfather; in this film he discovered (as did sooooo many other people) that it&#39;s not who you are, but who you can become. By rejecting being like Vader, he became his own person - but who that person is will only unfold in Episode IX.<br><br>Random thoughts:<br><br>-I see no reason to doubt that Rey&#39;s parents were nobody, but equally, her connection to the island was referred to too much for that to be all there is to it.<br><br>-The words &#39;the last Jedi&#39; appear in both dialogue and the title crawl of <i>Force Awakens</i>. Is the title of Episode IX in the crawl for LJ?<br><br>-I&#39;m pretty sure this film marks the first time in <i>Star Wars</i> history that a starship has run out of fuel - and the first time that a protagonist&#39;s reckless plan has not only failed, but also backfired horrifically. I approve. ^</em>^<br><br>hS</p>
