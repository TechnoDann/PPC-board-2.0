            <p>Hey Quincy! Since I don&#39;t frequent the Discord server, I don&#39;t know as much about you as I would if I did. So anyway! What brought you here? What are your fandoms and/or other interests? Do you have any OCs or potential agents? I&#39;m interested to know!<br><br>As for me, I&#39;m Twistey, a chaotic goodish lightly-used-bie who has too many ideas for stories and whatnot and not enough time to do all of them. I am very easily dragged into fandoms, but currently my biggest one would have to be Wolfenstein 3D (and to some extent, anything else iD Software did in the 90s.) I tend to be more skilled in the character aspects of stories rather than the plots themselves, but I hope to get better.<br><br>Anyway, for your newbie gift, here is a random pile of blueish metal, straight from Castle Wolfenstein. Do whatever you wish with it!<br><br>-Twistey</p>

            <p>Thanks for the welcome! Okay. Questions in linear order: <br><br>What brought me here was actually a friend of mine who&#39;s been a fan of this place since forever. They pointed me in the direction of the Wiki, which I then proceeded to devour. Cue me, six months later, finally discovering the page on which the Discord server lay, and gathering enough courage to click on it, where I discovered perhaps the most eclectic group of awesome people I have ever had the pleasure of interacting with. It&#39;s been a fun couple of weeks. <br><br>My fandoms and interests are a REALLY long story. I know most of the basics- Doctor Who, Lord of the Rings (my first ever fandom), the Silmarillion, the Hobbit, Harry Potter, PJO... there&#39;s quite a lot of them, actually. These are just the ones that come to mind right now XD. As for other interests... I&#39;m currently working on an original novel, which has put a bit of a damper on my media consumption, although Voltron has still managed to capture my heart. I love skiing and cold weather (ironic since I live in the DEEP SOUTH of America), Halloween and Christmas, and other people. (Seriously, people are great.) <br><br>As for OCs and potential agents... Since the dawn of time, I&#39;ve had this one character named Celestar, who is basically a giant goofball, and may have a few screws loose. He&#39;s... not really from any fandom, but I feel like he suits the theme of the PPC pretty well, what with his special brand of hilarious idiocy. <br><br>Also, thanks for the blue metal! *forges it into a ball-and-chain morningstar* I&#39;m not a fan of Wolfenstein myself- yet- but I do like one of the soundtracks. And I know what you mean about having too many ideas. I never ever have time, either. <br><br>Again, thank you very much for the warm welcome! I enthusiastically look forward to getting to know everyone here better, and perhaps even working with them in the future. I think we&#39;ll do great things together. <br><br>~Quincy Jones<br></p>

<li>Oh cool, you were recruited by a friend! I&#39;ve been looking to recruit people for a while, but have not succeeded yet...<br><br>2. Hehe, nice! Those are indeed the basics, I guess! Hmm, what&#39;s that original novel about? Sounds interesting.<br><br>3. It&#39;s totally fine that Celestar isn&#39;t from any fandom! Sounds like he does fit the PPC very well, but would work even better if he had a partner who was a lot more serious than him or something. (By the way, don&#39;t ever change his name. The name &quot;Celestar&quot; sounds really epic and LotR-esque, and given his personality, it&#39;s also lovably ironic as a result.)<br><br>4. Ooh! Which game&#39;s soundtrack are you a fan of? (Probably something from <i>Return to Castle Wolfenstein</i> onwards, given how low-bit music is just a little harder to appreciate...) If you&#39;re planning on joining the fandom, The Gaming Historian has a great video series on YouTube about the history of the franchise, explaining each of the games, and it&#39;s a good resource for finding out where to start. I recommend finding an online emulator (or a downloadable emulator, your choice) of Wolfenstein 3D and playing that one first, since it&#39;ll help boost your appreciation for all the other ones. I personally know that 3d.wolfenstein.com/ is the official one, and wolf3d.atw.hu/ is the one I&#39;ve been using and it comes with the Spear of Destiny DLC. But be forewarned that there are some pretty hard bosses, even on the easiest difficulty. I should probably stop rambling about Wolfenstein now...<br><br>-Twistey</li>

            <p>Alright. Your format works a lot better, so I&#39;m just gonna... *yoink* :D<br><br>1. Aww. That happens to me, too. <br><br>2. Oh boy oh boy! Twistey, if you don&#39;t want to hear me ramble on for ages about it, best to steer clear of asking me about my novel. XD Seriously though, there is no end to the ramble. Suffice it to say that it&#39;s currently about Celestar and his merry band of on-the-way recruits chasing down his older brother, who is actually his creepy but loving adoptive older vampire brother. The plan is to save him first, and then continue on to this city in the middle of enemy territory and break the husband of one of Celestar&#39;s recruits out of jail. This is a nearly insurmountable task. Celestar is doing it anyways. <br><br>3. Yay! I think my other agent is going to be this guy named Vaughan, who is either a total stickler for protocol or a bad boy who gets the job done ASAP. Either way, he will pull his hair out at young Celestar&#39;s antics. <br><br>4. So, in my previous reply to your message, I may have said something similar to &quot;I don&#39;t really know much about the game.&quot; I&#39;m going to edit that to: &quot;I know literally nothing about the game(s, apparently) except it contains Nazis.&quot; My favorite song is a remixed version of &quot;Boom Boom Boom,&quot; which, as I understand it, is a song within the game? *confuzzled expression, shrug* Heh. Thanks for the advice, though! If, by some miracle, time for a new game pops into my life, I will check it out for sure. </p>

            <p>(Yeah, on YouTube there&#39;s this great electronic music composer <i>and game developer!</i> known as SYRSA, and he(?) made a great song that has been renamed to Daunter, but was originally called Yonk. I guess it&#39;s because he was annoyed that the song became heavily associated with the Team Fortress 2 fandom? Or that a remix of the song that didn&#39;t indicate that it was a remix got confused with the original and was sometimes more popular than his version? Anyway.)<br><br>2. Hah, that sounds pretty fun.<br><br>3. You&#39;re getting it! Double comedy!<br><br>4. Oh ho ho do I have a lot to teach you! I&#39;m not familiar with Boom Boom Boom, so I&#39;m probably thinking it&#39;s from Wolfenstein The New Order. Anyway, enjoy!<br><br>-Twistey</p>

I&#39;m an avid Death Note fan, I watch a little bit of Doctor Who, Lord of the Rings and Dragon Age were my literal childhood (I grew up on those stories), I know Percy Jackson pretty well, and... there&#39;s more, I&#39;m just not thinking of them XD.

            <p>I&#39;m a huge manga fan and I really loved death note. I&#39;m not that into Lord of the Rings (please don&#39;t kill me) but I did play dragon age a little bit. Since you liked death note, I highly recommend Code Geass and No Game No Life if you haven&#39;t watched them. They both have different premises, and No Game No Life is a lot less serious, but I think you would really enjoy them. </p>

Usually the editing is where I have the most fun, but I&#39;ve taken to viewing NaNoWriMo as  the time where you find the pieces that you&#39;ll be writing, and editing the next month as a matter of when I get to actually put them together. A lot of parts naturally won&#39;t get used, but I view that as being perfectly fine, since just because some of my ideas won&#39;t get used this time around, it won&#39;t mean I won&#39;t get to use them in the future. <br><br>My first drafts will always be a little disjointed but that&#39;s to be expected.

Shh.) It&#39;s also nice to see Charlotte&#39;s character development.<br><br>Anyway. I kind of forgot this was coming, and it was nice to see it. And I&#39;d say more, but I read it...uh, yesterday? The day before? Anyway, this is what I remember wanting to say, so...yeah.<br><br>~Z</p>

            <p>but I wanted to point out three things I think are very well done:<br><br>1a. The constant attention to detail you gave in comparing a <i>Twilight</i> vampire&#39;s senses to a human&#39;s.  It hadn&#39;t really occurred to me how big a change this was going to be for Charlotte—partly because I haven&#39;t read the Saga yet, and the vampires seem so human compared to the older styles of vampires, I didn&#39;t realize they are actually dead.  But you really put it into perspective for me.  Although one thing I only just noticed as I wrote is that no mention is made of Charlotte&#39;s voice after the morph.  I would think it must have changed at least a little, yeah?<br><br>1b. Following from this, I really like the contrast between Ix, with her physical disabilities, managing to outperform human!Charlotte, despite Charlotte&#39;s &quot;healthy&quot; body, due to the lack of practice and exercise yet on Charlotte&#39;s part.  And I <i>really</i> like Ix&#39;s simple explanation and the implications behind it: humans are adaptive; we don&#39;t succeed through superpowers or unnatural abilities, we just keep trying until we stop sucking.  Very nice!<br><br>2. And that, I&#39;m sure, will flow nicely into the continuation of their ESAS service.  It was a lovely twist, coming from the perfect Flower to deliver the bad news and not care.  But I look forward to Charlotte learning to use her wits and perseverance against uber-Sues now that her strength and speed are gone.<br><br>—doctorlit, probably going to maybe read <i>Twilight</i>, someday, eventually, perhaps, if he finds the Saga for cheap in Goodwill, all in one visit, without any movie characters on the covers, paperback only, if they&#39;re all in good condition.  Then maybe.</p>

            <p>1a. Ah, drat, I was hoping nobody would mention the voice! The reason why I didn&#39;t mention a change? I hadn&#39;t yet pinned down what she sounded like in my head. Vaguely British, but with a lot of valley girl thrown in?!<br><br>(If you&#39;ve got a suggestion for a workaround, I&#39;m all ears.)<br><br>1b) ^-^ Totally agree with that assessment. I know I wouldn&#39;t be half as good at picking things up with my feet if it weren&#39;t for my back problems. It might be weird, but it sure works.<br><br>2) And that is what I&#39;m very much looking forward to writing.<br><br>Save yourself and read Das Mervin&#39;s sporkings. Much funnier and less vomit-inducing. :P</p>

            <p>Hey there Emilia! I&#39;m Twistey, a lightly-used-bie with too many fandoms and too many ideas. I write a combo of fanfic and original worlds (mostly original), absolutely love MSTing and otherwise reacting to things, and have actually lost friends to my fervent insistence on fanfiction excellence. True story.<br><br>Anyway, enough about me, who are you? How&#39;d you find us, what fandoms are you into, etc. I&#39;m interested to know more (I think all of us are.)<br><br>And finally, your newbie gift! Currently I&#39;m feeling ready to kick the butts of some blonde villains (and the blonde heroines of some franchises that show obvious favoritism - but why I&#39;m in this mood is another story for another day), so here, you can have a virtual version of my BJ Blazkowicz cosplay outfit, and a nerf gun that resembles Wolfenstein 3D&#39;s Chain Gun as well. Your virtual self or your agents may be equipped with this gift. Use it wisely.<br><br>Anyway, nice to meet you! I hope you have a great time here. Welcome to the PPC!<br><br>-Twistey</p>

            <p>I made my own drop spindle (using a plastic toy umbrella as the base, actually) - to that end, I did have to look up what a drop spindle looks like. I, stubborn as I was, didn&#39;t look anything up but instead just fiddled around until I got something that seemed threadlike.

            <p>...a whole bunch of random knowledge that sometimes comes in handy in my life has come from Tamora Pierce books. Also a number of others...most recently, though, I think, was the moment when I was cleaning part of the apartment and remembering Tris teaching Briar how to lift up the things on the shelf to dust them (and under them) rather than just poking around the spaces between them. Also, the bit about dusting before sweeping, though I didn&#39;t do that (there wasn&#39;t so much dust, though). So that&#39;s a thing. And I&#39;m pretty sure I&#39;ve tried the horse thing, too, though I think I learned it from a different book of hers.<br><br>Essentially: yes, definitely. Also, have you read any other Tamora Pierce books? We could talk about it! :) Shared fandoms are always great.<br><br>~Z</p>

            <p>Which...is a phrase I&#39;m fairly sure I&#39;ve never in my life heard anyone use, but shh, I&#39;m going to make it a thing for the moment. Anyway: I&#39;ve read the Beka Cooper books, but I don&#39;t remember much more about them than the general storyline, and even that is really incomplete. I didn&#39;t connect to them as much as I did to her other books, so I never really reread them? Or maybe I&#39;ve reread one? I actually own one or two of them, but they&#39;ve mostly just stayed on the shelf after I read them the first time...which was when they came out, hence why I don&#39;t really remember much.<br><br>Meanwhile, I&#39;ve done the opposite with most of the rest of her books.<br><br>Oh well. Still cool to meet another person who&#39;s read some Tamora Pierce :)<br><br>~Z</p>

            <p>It&#39;s been a pretty good election for the Democratic Party, really. Hopefully it signifies a move away from Trump-style populism.<br><br>Meanwhile, we had an election recently down here in New Zealand. That ended in pretty much the weirdest way possible - right-wing incumbents National got ~46% of the vote, but the loosest of our loose cannons, Winston Peters, decided to screw them and go into coalition with our Labour Party instead.<br>I&#39;m still not sure how I feel about this. I mean, I&#39;m glad that National&#39;s out - screw them and their wrecking of our national parks - but I&#39;m not keen on Winnie having so much influence. I&#39;m just hoping the new government can get some good things done in the next three years.</p>

            <p>New Zealand First has a lot of policy that aligns with Labour - closing corporate tax loopholes, introducing guaranteed benefits for students, removing GST from things like food... that sort of thing. You can find their policy page <a href="http://www.nzfirst.org.nz/policies">here</a>, if you&#39;re at all interested (which you probably aren&#39;t).<br><br>The other thing is that Winston implicitly campaigned on a promise of change, with slogans such as &#39;Had Enough?&#39;. On top of that, he appears to be starting legal proceedings against some National Party members - something to do with the way he and his party were treated when he was in coalition with them.<br><br>Believe me, there&#39;s plenty of small-minded partisanship in New Zealand, too. Some of the rage from National supporters was almost as bad as Republicans&#39; response to Obama&#39;s election. Our system of government encourages it less, though. People can vote for the bigger small parties and have a reasonable expectation of that vote actually mattering to the makeup of the government, unlike in the US, where FPP turns every single election into an us vs. them between the far right and the moderate right, with no room for anyone else.</p>

            <p>I would certainly be in favour of some kind of mental health check - dementia screening, for example. But I wouldn&#39;t say that older people can&#39;t be effective members of the government.<br><br>What I <i>do</i> support is more engagement of younger people with politics. More possibility for younger people to run for election with a hope of winning, and more young people getting out and voting. The latter is widely regarded as what caused Theresa May to throw away her majority - Jeremy Corbyn managed to get young voters to actually come out and vote.<br><br>If the people who are going to have to live with the consequences for longest decide that age and experience is more valuable than what a younger candidate is offering, great - that&#39;s how democracy works. But America was offered a choice between Trump and Clinton, both around 70 (and Bernie at 75!); Britain was presented with May at 60 and Corbyn at 68. In ten years, all of them except Mrs May will be beyond the point where today&#39;s policies really affect them (except in terms of healthcare, but HAHA they&#39;re all rich anyway so who cares about the poor amirite?); why were they the only options for making those policies?<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>The answer to your question is the latter, basically because of what Twistey said: Sues don&#39;t play by the rules.<br><br>A metaphor springs to mind. Normally, your immune system lets you fight off infections the way your main character normally throws off mind control. However, certain viruses mess with your very DNA in order to disrupt the immune system, and then you can get sick. Sues mess with the DNA of a canon, i.e. its Words, so your main character may be susceptible to malign influences they otherwise might not be.<br><br>I&#39;m sure it&#39;s not a perfect metaphor, but I hope it makes sense!<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Would it be more accurate to say, instead of describing it as mind control, that the very existence of a Mary Sue warps reality in a certain area? A bit like how gravitational fields work if I need to give an analogy.</p>

            <p>In PPC lore, Suvians have an Aura of Smooth that influences the people around them to irrationally like them, or to irrationally hate them if that&#39;s what they need to make a point about how right/awesome they are. It&#39;s not direct mind control, more of a passive effect, but it is due to the active whims of the Sue in question.<br><br>Similarly, most of the canon-warping that happens in a Suefic is a result of what the Sue is actively doing to carve out a place for itself where it doesn&#39;t belong. Its mere existence isn&#39;t always enough, but sometimes it is, if its existence is impossible without it even having to do anything. The more impossible it is, the bigger the effect.<br><br>...

            <p>Hi! If you plan to join, welcome! If you don&#39;t, I understand. (I myself almost didn&#39;t join because my parents don&#39;t really like the very idea of sporking.) I&#39;m Twistey, and I haven&#39;t been there for that long, but it seems to me that I&#39;m the only one here to answer your question, so I will do so.<br><br>It depends on what your story&#39;s plot is, but in most circumstances, I think that the canon would definitely fall under the Suefluence, because of the following truth: Canons play fair. Sues don&#39;t.<br><br>Also, from a writing perspective: Since canons never really play a major part in a PPC fic (and they&#39;re not supposed to, since agents aren&#39;t supposed to disrupt them), they would probably be best just acting like the other canons do when under Suefluence, otherwise they&#39;d risk trying to help the agents (which is not too good of an idea under most circumstances.)<br><br>Anyone else feel free to correct me if I&#39;m wrong.<br><br>-Twistey</p>

            <p>Yeah, go on fanfiction.net and search either swing123 or garfieldodie (or, alternitavey, search &quot;The Calvinverse&quot; on Tv Tropes), they&#39;re probably some of the best known C&amp;H writers out there.</p>
