            <p>The flashback part is a really nice opening. I was happy to see the Second back, even if for a moment, and Gavan&#39;s subtle nod at different environment (&quot;Green grass and blue skies&quot; makes you almost add &#39;weird&#39; afterwards) is also a nice touch. I gotta admit, I was worried it&#39;s gonna turn into a full-on nightmare when Gav spoke in Ellie&#39;s voice... Glad you didn&#39;t go that way (also, now I have the scene from <i>Junior</i> with the pregnant Arnold Schwarzenegger in my head...).<br><br>Good call to see Ellie already maturing this much, which is in-spirit with Time Lord biology and, for some reason, the cereal scene made me smile. I don&#39;t know why, but after all the troubles and mishaps Ave has had in the past, considering her PTSD and all issues, making your kid a big bowl of cereal makes it so mundane and peaceful it&#39;s almost relaxing to read. Plus, of course, Zeb being the Zebbiest Zeb that ever Zebbed is also a plus. #MoreZeb<br><br>Stupid console startling poor precious babby :&lt; Also, parenting Aviator FTW.<br><br>Okay, maybe it&#39;s just me seeing things, but I&#39;ve noticed a bit more of the &quot;badfic correction&quot; instead of straight-up &quot;charging ALL the canon differences&quot;. That&#39;s nice. That&#39;s the approach I&#39;m trying to take, that&#39;s my PPC way.<br><br>Something didn&#39;t sit me right with the sentence: &quot;<i>the front steps of the museum where Yancy Academy would soon be visiting</i>&quot; My first thought was the entire school was going there, but who knows, maybe it&#39;s just an ESL being stoopid.<br><br>I completely forgot about Zeb and the thread! Nice callback and keeping with the continuity. And the ending does NOT leave me relaxed about it...<br><br>Overall, I liked it. Nice and light mission, well &#39;light&#39; for a pair of experiences abomination killers. Yep, definitely enjoyed it.<br><br></p>

            <p>It&#39;s been a while since I&#39;ve read a mission, but I decided to read this one (after seeing it was only - &#39;only&#39;! - 16 pages). No thoughts; I&#39;m barely awake enough to have taken it in. Good stuff.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I pasted a few missions into LibreOffice (11pt Arial, letter paper, 1-inch margins to match GDocs&#39;/Ix&#39;s formatting) to get page counts.<br><br>The first mission of TOS is nine pages long.<br><br>The 22nd (Elemental Crystals) is 13.<br><br>Nume and Ilraen&#39;s first mission is 11 pages, while their third (the Pern crossover) is 31.<br><br>The Notary and Wobbles&#39; first mission (ignoring the title page) is 22 pages (GDocs already was formatted in the way I was comparing to).<br><br>Picking somewhat arbitrarily off of your work, &quot;Opposite Reaction Same Result &quot; is 12 pages, &quot;legolas, by Laura&quot; is 10.<br><br>Since somehow I felt like more datapoints, the Cupcakes mission is 25 pages, &quot;Shed No Tears&quot;, also by WarriorJoe (which appears to be a short one, given that it&#39;s not posted in two parts), is 12.<br><br>Then, since I have a bunch of Ix&#39;s writing saved, I have the following stats:<br><br>Over my entire archive (including interludes), which has 113 documents:<br><pre><br>   Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. <br>   2.00   10.00   17.00   19.27   24.00   56.00 <br></pre>
<br><br>Over the &quot;typical missions&quot; (assuming the 23 documents that had 7 or fewer pages were interludes and that the 11 documents with at least 40 pages were outliers):<br><br><pre><br>   Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. <br>   8.00   14.00   19.00   19.37   22.00   39.00<br></pre>
<br><br>So, my conclusion here is that a 16 page mission is, while maybe a bit long by the standards of TOS, well within the typical length range.<br><br>(note: me-generated counts may be off by about a page or two at worst if GDocs and LibreOffice disagree about how tall the space between paragraphs should be.)<br><br>- Tomash</p>

            <p>Running thoughts:<br>- Ok, this is starting with a dream sequence. Is that going to be significant? Of course it is. <br>- Elanor still getting used to the console makes sense<br>- Transitioning from going to the Nursery to &quot;in the fic&quot; seemed a bit abrupt. It felt like I was missing a scene there.<br>- Heh. The CAD is in danger of exploding right at the start. That must be a bad fic.<br>- Zeb/Jacques confirmed? Fuzzy gay blue upbeat Pokemon<br>- Ok, the fic is bad and makes no sense, the agents snark at it, I get a sense of what&#39;s going on without having to read the whole darn thing, as expected<br>- Right. I&#39;d completely forgotten about the thing with the thread. I like the callback here because it keeps the character arc going.<br>- I hope Zeb doesn&#39;t get too existential-crisisy about that thread. It sort of looks like he&#39;s headed that way for a moment there.<br>- I&#39;m liking the several instances of &quot;I&#39;m glad that wasn&#39;t taken literally.&quot; It means we can get the literal interpretation without having it actually happen, which would be pretty dark for a bunch of these.<br>- &#39;Misrepresenting mental health issues&#39; definitely has a place on the list<br>- One of the Fates looking at the agents and rolling their eyes is a nice touch<br>- Ok, that moment of vague sadness seems to be extended. <i>passes Zeb some Poffins</i><br>- Ave, why&#39;d you volunteer to field test something?<br>  - I like the thing with the betting pool. That was funny.<br>- Awwww, the sunset thing is cute<br>  - And I expect an Elanor vacation interlude several years from now<br>- “You’d think we’d be better at not letting this keep ****ing happening to us&quot; was a good joke at your own spin-off&#39;s expense<br>- I like the effects of mixing the books and the movies<br>- Near-unison &quot;charge&quot; makes makes sense as a reaction to the minotaur thing<br>- The lighthouse was a neat bit of interpretation<br>- The Sue and Percy being in the same space is a nice complication. Pulling them apart makes sense as a resolution. <br>- That ending ... Ave is going to pay for that line later, isn&#39;t she?<br><br>General thoughts:<br>This was a very mision-y mission. It followed the fic rather closely and mainly snarked at it, but it had enough inter-agent interaction to make it not be a slog through the fic or a MST or anything, even though it might&#39;ve been somewhere near-ish that line.<br><br>I like that, despite being a rather typical mission, it didn&#39;t feel particularly typical or stare. <br><br>The self-reference, including making jokes about your own typical scenes and the whole thing with the thread, is nice. It makes it feel like the story fits into a longer arc.<br><br>So, overall, one minor complaint, but it was pretty good otherwise.<br><br>- Tomash</p>

            <p>That was good and heartwarming.<br><br>From what I remember of Whitney and Backslash, this scene follows from the previous stories, even though the callbacks were a bit dense in parts (though it didn&#39;t really impact the story much).<br><br>I liked the descriptions of the scenery, it worked rather well.<br><br>- Tomash</p>

            <p>Unfortunately, I haven&#39;t have the time to write those previous stories that led to their relationship becoming the way it is now, but the lead-in to and the aftermath of that critical event I&#39;ve been teasing the Board about for some time now will probably explore said relationship in more detail, including its origin and the way these two have gotten to understand each other up until now.

            <p>Not a whole lot to say here, mostly because of me missing plot points back while I wasn&#39;t reading missions.  I didn&#39;t catch any of Whitney and Backslash&#39;s relationship leading up to this, but it seems like a nice scene in general.  I like that the tone is very plain, reflecting the honest communication that is both the vehicle and the topic of the conversation here.  I also like that events from the past, and the relationships these two characters have with other not in this interlude are shown to have an effect on Whitney and Backslash without dominating the conversation.  It makes it feel realistic, and keeps the present scene from feeling like a self-contained box.<br><br>I also like how you include Alice&#39;s herd in the background details, and even use them to animate the action of your characters&#39; eyes at one point, but again, without letting the horses&#39; presence detract from the flow of the scene.  Although, speaking of that moment:<br><br>&quot;Backslash just barely managed to avert her gaze by glancing at the horses in the distance.&quot;<br><br>I assume &quot;avert&quot; here is supposed to be &quot;avoid?&quot;  &quot;Avert&quot; implies Backslash is somehow forcing Whitney to look away from him, which doesn&#39;t make sense.<br><br>And also, just to check:<br><br>&quot;&#39;Merry Christmas to you to, Whitey,&#39; he said . . .&quot;<br><br>Was &quot;Whitey&quot; intentional there, or is it supposed to be &quot;Whitney&quot; again?<br><br>But yeah.  Very simply executed scene that feels very effective to me.<br><br>—doctorlit, Wii Unfit Trainer</p>

            <p>Thank you for the kind words, and I&#39;m glad you liked it! Unfortunately, since I haven&#39;t been able to write pretty much ANYTHING noteworthy PPC-wise this year aside from a couple of interludes and ficlets, mostly related to Falchion and his team, I haven&#39;t been able to showcase WHEN Whitney and Backslash&#39;s relationship began - but let&#39;s just say that it&#39;ll start happening after some very critical events I&#39;m still planning which, in-universe, happened on Christmas of 2016, which was actually hinted at in the interlude proper. Their relationship upgrade has been in the works for a while and I&#39;ve pretty much now spoiled the fact that it&#39;s led up to this proposal, but I still have to figure out HOW it began and it has some connections with said critical events, along with Falchion&#39;s team. We&#39;ll see how my writing muse fares next year if Real Life doesn&#39;t obstruct it! ^^;<br><br>As for your two nitpicks, &quot;avert&quot; DOES mean &quot;avoid&quot;, as in &quot;avert your eyes&quot; being used to mean &quot;don&#39;t look&quot;. And as for &quot;Whitey&quot;, that was a slip of the tongue on Backslash&#39;s part during the events of <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Hkv1QpqOvm_JHr3VoOehvuO2kS9RZbKN9_jKcxJnxwM/edit">&quot;Good Knight and Good Luck&quot;</a>, and he&#39;s been using it as an affectionate nickname for her since then.</p>

            <p>Backslash technically never did have a last name. He was just named that on the spot by the people at Medical when he was sent to HQ, and then decided to roll with it because he realized a while later that he didn&#39;t HAVE a name. I did consider giving him a surname before this point but decided that it wouldn&#39;t really add anything to his story - until he marries Whitney, whereupon he&#39;ll likely take HER surname instead.

            <p>Initially I was going to protest that the intent was for Backslash to worry that Whitney was going to say no, but having given it some thought I now realize that I really did mess up there. The correct wording should be either &quot;How could I not say yes?&quot; or &quot;How could I say no?&quot; The goof has now been rectified with the former phrasing. ^^;</p>

            <p>I think it&#39;s currently the 25th for just about everyone in the PPC, so it seems like a good enough time to post this thread. <br><br>I&#39;ve had a pretty good holiday so far. It&#39;s been spent at my aunt and uncle&#39;s in Poland along with one set of grandparents, and it&#39;s been nice seeing them again and eating a whole bunch of food (there&#39;s a traditional 12-course Christmas Eve dinner, which my aunt and grandma made, which was good).<br><br>Gift-wise, among other things, I got a copy of <i>Oathbringer</i> (the third Stormlight Archives book), which I will end up binge-reading at some point this week.

            <p>Been a pretty good day so far.

Was good film.<br><br>Very happy with gifts, too. Mum knitted me a lovely scarf in Hufflepuff colors, got the first Republic Commando book (which I&#39;ve been meaning to read for ages. Plus, Republic Commando covers some stuff that&#39;s useful for one of my potential agent&#39;s background), Dragonriders of Pern (heard more than a few recommendations around here), and Records of the Medieval Sword (quite looking forward to getting a slightly more in-depth source than Wikipedia and YouTube).<br><br>All in all, good day.

I&#39;m talking how rolls work, the granularity of key statistics (&quot; Does the average line mech have 7 crew points or seventy?&quot;), crunch levels, things like that. I presume that this will be one of those games with a massive rulebook for every last detail.<br><br>What is the nature and extent of the weird future technologies? Does every faction get laser weapons and shields? What powers the Thompson Drive? Has the home front seen any benefits yet?<br><br>Relatedly, what are the weapons like? Are they mech-sized versions of infantry guns? Massive artillery pieces? Are there any setting-unique weapons that set your world apart from any other mech-based combat games?<br><br>As for feedback, what I see I find really interesting, but it&#39;s a bit early to draw conclusions now. What I would want from this game probably differs a bit from what you want from it.</p>

            <p>I imagine the game running in a similar sort of way to Battletech, but on a grander scale and with more of a Powell and Pressburger-y aesthetic. It&#39;s also got a bit of FTL&#39;s crew shuffling mechanics, as well as the upgrades, points cost, and cornucopia of upgrades and bonuses for even the most teeny-tiny robot and its most junior commander taken wholesale from every mad roguelike I&#39;ve ever played. Rolls are made using D20s, and there&#39;s plenty of them; I intend it to be like a kind of insane mashup of Battletech, Path Of Exile, FTL, Warhammer 40000, and Risk. Even if the last one is mostly because it&#39;ll go on forever. =]<br><br>The Thompson Drive is essentially a primitive fusion reactor, the initial incarnation of which was hammered together out of Weird Science, a lot of oddly-shaped metal, and the contents of Dr. Archibald Thompson (4th Viscount Kincaid)&#39;s garden shed. The plans were recovered and refined by the British War Office in 1917 at the behest of Lady Thompson, who wanted it to be a memorial to her husband. It was supposed to end war, you see, in much the same way that dynamite was.<br><br>The fact of it is, occupational health and safety was about as much a concern for WWI-era military institutions as whether or not the spider taking up residence in the corner of one&#39;s bedroom answers to the name of Mildred. The British Army in particular was notorious for this, treating the common soldier (the <i>extremely</i> common soldier) as what amounted to a not terribly bright attack dog with a penchant for hard booze and women of easy virtue. Thus, in order to squeeze as much power out of a mech&#39;s Thompson Drive as possible, nimby-pimby things like radiation shielding and guard rails are left entirely by the wayside in favour of more armour, more guns, and more ammunition. However, individual crews spend a lot of time in their mechs, and tend to cobble together their own versions so that the &quot;stock model&quot;, as it were, is rendered safer and more user-friendly. The uncharitable might compare the modifications&#39; collective utility to putting a leash made of used dental floss around the neck of a maternally outraged grizzly bear, but it&#39;s better than nothing. Probably.<br><br>Essentially, every faction has access to everything from 1-inch naval guns to War of the Worlds style heat beams, but not every faction has access to heat beams that actually, y&#39;know, <i>work</i>. At least not all the time. Building a mech is about tradeoffs. If you want heroic and gallant officers who do their duty with the courage and honour of a particularly fervent Ultramarine Chapter Master, you have to forgo the laser zap bolts. Conversely, your superheavy stompmonster might have all the bells and whistles you can cram into it, as well as a few more you nailed to the outside, but it would end up being led by some unspeakably inoffensive stuffed-shirt with delusions of adequacy. Or it could have both of those positive attributes, but run the risk of turning into an Extremely Not Cheap crater every time the chief engineer so much as looks at it funny. It&#39;s really up to what the individual player wants to do.<br><br>See, to my mind, you can get roleplaying by proxy out of a crunch-heavy game just by giving the player options out the wazoo. Two players from the same faction might build completely separate armies - one might theme their force around a grizzled, wily old mech captain hurling his ancient war machines into one last battle with every trick in the book at his disposal, and the other might prefer a small cadre of highly experimental mechs forced to enter battle as a last resort and captained by people whose field experience chiefly involves hiding under something heavy-looking and waiting for the horrid bangy noises to stop. A third might do something totally different. It&#39;s really up to the players! At least, that&#39;s how I envision it being.<br><br>As far as weapons go, they&#39;re a mix of actual artillery, converted naval weapons, big rockets, scaled-up infantry equipment, experimental weapons that would otherwise be impractical, and a boatload of Weird Sci-Fi Weapons with a coat of WW1 paint slapped over them (which is presumably either khaki, mud brown, or very, very red). For example, Thompson Drives don&#39;t lend themselves at all well to miniaturization, so they&#39;re no good for aircraft, but the biggest mechs can also function as aircraft carriers that fuel battery-powered biplanes and monoplanes with the energy output of the Drive. Those planes might only have an air-time of 15 minutes, but that&#39;s more than enough time to act as bombers, spotters, and interference runners in the field. All the dashing fighter aces? They&#39;re mech captains now, or working for them as grunts piloting Lillehammer-style bomb-armed helicopters.<br><br>The point of that weird little story is that thanks to the Thompson Drive, however tangentially, a lot of the mad ideas of early 20th century science-fiction writers <i>sort of</i> work. The home front looks Edwardian, but the streets are lit with electric lights, the trains are all electrified, and in many ways it has the infrastructure of a modern nation (without the internet, obviously). We&#39;ve even been to the Moon - though it was the British Empire that did it first, and not without blowing up a few dozen would-be astronauts. Grand zeppelins cruise the sky-lines of the world, calling at &quot;air-ports&quot; to recharge their batteries and let the great and the good take in the air of foreign climes. The Russian Revolution still happened... ish. The world is changing and the world is weird.<br><br>There isn&#39;t an iconic weapon yet, but in my head I have some quietly excited gentleman scientist showing the PM his plans for a new bunker-busting supergun that fires a burst of energy analogous to that of a solar flare. The squat, dumpy, orange-glowing thing is hooked up to a Thompson Drive, hums ominously, and after a few seconds of charging incinerates a stand of small oak trees roughly half a mile away. Thus, the Sun Cannon begins to be equipped to British mechs, and launches searing stellar plasma at the rampaging Boche. One imagines there&#39;s a picture of such a thing happening in the rulebook somewhere. =]<br><br>I hope this was of some use to you. If nothing else, it certainly was to me. =]</p>

Be they a burger van operator and part-time supervillain in a decaying seaside town, a modern art lecturer and defender against the unknown horrors of a terrifying multiverse, or a former naval officer with a very special wristwatch, it&#39;s about power in the end, and what people with power will let themselves get away with. Power fascinates me. It&#39;s why I write a Time Lord, at least in part. Power, and people with power, inform every aspect and every moment of our lives, and what they do with their power - however meagre, however local - ripples out into the world. A little old man who&#39;s lived at number 22 for as long as anyone can remember might not think they have power, but they do, and it&#39;s interesting to look at it and analyse it and, well, appreciate it. We all have power, in our own way.<br><br>It&#39;s up to us to decide what we do with it.</p>

            <p>So, I&#39;ve been working out this idea for a while, a story set in an urban fantasy setting, albeit one where regular humans and supernaturals exist side-by-side.<br><br>Of course, my paranoia (and too much time spent on TVTropes) has left me iffy about my writing skills. So I figured I&#39;d just ask for some feedback.

            <p>But it feels empty or incomplete somehow? You have this solid magic system in place but it lacks... something. I can&#39;t really say it in a word. Your magic is solid, but it lacks intricacy, so to speak. So far, all it tells me is the what, it doesn&#39;t tell me the why and how. You mention a cost for your magic, here is where you could elaborate much more. In general, yes, costs vary widely, but maybe a certain type of cost can be more closely associated with a certain type of magic. Like say draining lifespan is more common in necromancy. Also, are there any taboos for magic use, rules that the world itself enforces? A common one would be &quot;any attempt to fully bring back the dead will result in something really bad&quot;. You also have Ofuda, which is a regional magic, why only one? Other cultures have surely created their own magics; using other regional magics can open up opportunities for contrast and character interaction, such as using Taoism to compare and contrast with Ofuda. Finally, you mentioned magitek, that&#39;s all well and good, but maybe try and think a bit more on how that would work, consider things such as power source and how the magic is actually delivered. What about some of its uses other than &quot;powers electronic devices&quot;? Maybe it lets a normal person with no magical talent cast simple spells through a smartphone app, or lets cameras take pictures of otherwise invisible objects. Your magic system is really good so far, but it can use a lot more detail, especially since it&#39;s supposed to be &quot;another form of science&quot;. <br><br>As for the races, there isn&#39;t really much to say here other than that it shares pretty much the same problem as the magic. It&#39;s has the stereotypical fantasy races with a bunch of other mythological creatures added in. It&#39;s nice, but your elves are just elves, you could have done away with the description of the fair folk and I would still know what the fair folk are like. Although, this is a pretty minor problem and doesn&#39;t necessarily have to be addressed. The big problem is that you did the region thing again. Your world is on a global scale and thus should logically have more than just western and Japanese monsters. India  and the middle east exists in your world, no? Where are the rakshasas and asuras? Or the silas and ifrits? These don&#39;t belong to the bestiary because they are sapient. <br><br>All in all, its a great base for your world, but there is a lot more detailing to be done for your magic system, and maybe try making it a bit more globalized given the setting.</p>

            <p>Unfortunately, I&#39;m not sure how to implement details to the magic system. Maybe magic can be implemented in a variety of ways?

            <p>Instead of thinking about what you magic can actually do, try thinking about how it actually occurs. So, let us conduct a bit of a case study here. I will use the systems from Fullmetal Alchemist and Eragon. (Say what you will about inheritance cycle, but I do like the magic system for having simple rules, yet allows for some complexity in usage.) Read the last 2 paragraphs if you don&#39;t want spoilers.<br><br>So first, Fullmetal Alchemist. Alchemy is essentially transmuting one material into another. That answers &quot;what&quot;, pretty basic, but not very detailed. But, its the rules and workings of alchemy that gives it detail. Here are a few:<br>- Alchemy is done via a transmutation circle.<br>- The transmutation circle can be pre-drawn such as the case of Roy Mustangs gloves.<br>- Different circles must be drawn for different processes.<br>- One does not need a circle if they have seen the gate of truth.<br>- There must be an equivalent exchange, one cannot &quot;create too much from too little&quot;<br>- A philosopher&#39;s stone does not circumvent equivalent exchange, but rather is a source of &quot;cost&quot; that can be used to increase what is created, once it is used up, one can no longer &quot;break&quot; equivalent exchange unless a new one is acquired.<br>- Philosopher&#39;s stones are created from human souls, how long one lasts depends on how many souls it has. The souls get used as a substitute cost.<br>- A Philosopher&#39;s stone can be split into many portions so long as each portion contains at least 1 soul.<br>- The cost of alchemy is payed through the gate of truth which exists in every person<br>- One can no longer perform alchemy if they lose their gate.<br>- And so on and so forth...<br><br>As for Eragon, magic is a real physical effect invoked by a spell. And like a detailed magic system, it has rules:<br>- Spells are spoken in the ancient language.<br>- What is said in the language is what happens.<br>- Spells can be as long as need be for precision.<br>- Spells cost as much energy as it would have required if the effect was done manually.<br>- Overexerting oneself results in death.<br>- One can outsource energy cost to other living things.<br>- One can store energy in precious stones.<br>- Grammar is important.<br><br>So, as you can see, what gives magic detail isn&#39;t what the magic can do, but how the magic works. A good analogy is physics. What makes physics complicated isn&#39;t what it is, but is the absurd number of rules and concepts that it has, laws of physics such as Newton&#39;s laws of motion, Maxwell&#39;s equations, particle-wave duality etc. Similarly, to add detail to your magic, you could create a set of rules, the laws of magic, if you will. Once you do have a set of laws, you can then extrapolate some gimmicks the magic might have. For example, in Eragon, instead of saying &quot;die&quot; a magic user could say &quot;sever his carotid artery&quot; instead to save energy. The end result is the same, but the cost is different.<br><br>As for the races, spicing it up isn&#39;t really necessary since this is urban fantasy. One trait of the genre is that creatures that appear in myths have been living along side us all this time. But, there is a way to differentiate from high fantasy and that is to diversify your races, essentially make it less homogenized. How might orcs from different areas of the world have developed differently? This also happens to solve the region problem in my previous post, just make regional variants of existing races that somewhat match mythical descriptions. For example, you could say that Rakshasas are simply a variant of Oni. Just an idea.</p>

            <p>...Though given my lack of ability to understand technical details (I have something of a short attention span) it might be tricky. Well, that&#39;s what research and planning are for, right?<br><br>I&#39;m also partially inspired by a novel I found called &quot;Dirty Magic&quot;. Basically it takes place in a world where magic exists, but the story focuses on a cop dealing in illegal potions. (It&#39;s part of a series, and I haven&#39;t read the rest of them yet, so I&#39;m not sure if actual spells are involved). <br><br>That being said, I do recommend this book if you like urban fantasy. The author really put a lot of work into creating the world, something I want to emulate. Be warned though, it gets pretty intense at points.</p>

            <p>... when I have time, it sounds pretty interesting.<br><br>Anyways back on topic. You say you have a hard time understanding technical details. If you don&#39;t know where to actually start creating technical details, there are six broad questions you need to ask; keep in mind these six broad questions can be used for each part of worldbuilding, although the significance of each question may vary depending on which part you are developing. As you may have guessed, the six questions are who, what, when, where, why, and how. These are obviously too broad to be of direct use, so let&#39;s break it down, this is by no means an exhaustive list.<br><br><pre>Who - who can use magic<br>- Can anyone use magic?<br>- Is talent decided at birth, or can the gift be acquired through some special means?<br>- What determines power?<br>- Can a person get more powerful? If so, how?<br>- Does race affect magic?<br>  - Are there some types of magic that some races cannot use?<br>  - Are certain races better at magic?<br>    - Better at only certain types?<br>  - Do some races have an innate form of magic?<br>    - Are some races incapable of magic save for any innate magic?<br><br>What - What is magic? (You answered this pretty well already, but here are a few more questions you can consider)<br>-What are the costs associated with magic?<br>  - Are there different costs for different types of magic?<br>  - Do certain races get a discount for certain types of magic?<br>- Are there any taboos associated with magic?<br>- Is there an &quot;Order&quot; to the universe that magic cannot break?<br>  - If there is and it can be broken, what are the consequences or extra cost of breaking said Order?<br>- What are the weaknesses and limitations of magic?<br><br>When - when can you use magic?<br>- Are there certain spells that only work in certain times?<br>- Are there auspicious periods where magic can get stronger/ cost less?<br>  - If so, do certain periods correspond to certain types of magic?<br>  - Can this time period be used to break taboos?<br><br>Where - where can you use magic?<br>- Are there dead zones? (places where magic does not work or is weaker)<br>- Are there places where magic is stronger? (Ley lines perhaps?)<br>- Are there places where certain types of magic is strengthened but others are weakened?<br>  - Is there a way to manipulate the affinity of such places?<br><br>How - How is magic used?<br>- what is the procedure of spell casting?<br>  - Magic symbols?<br>  - Gestures and movements?<br>  - Sound?<br>  - Words?<br>  - Force of will?<br>  - A combination of any of the above as well as anything I did not think of?<br>  - Do these differ depending on magic type/race?<br>- How is magic applied to technology?<br>- How are new spells discovered?<br><br>Why - This is arguably the trickiest, and not always necessary. Just keep &quot;Why?&quot; in mind whenever you make a decision in your world building, if the answer doesn&#39;t require too much metaphysical stuff, try to answer it. An example of an answerable one is &quot;Why are there dead zones?&quot; An example of one you could leave alone is &quot;Why does magic exist?&quot;<br></pre>
<br>As for keeping all this in your mind, make a document of the answers you have given as a reference sheet. Also, since these are all yes and no answers, specify if yes.<br><br>Oh, and don&#39;t forget Sanderson&#39;s laws.<br></p>

            <p>I&#39;m working out the ideas, not sure if I should share it when I&#39;m done to have someone go over them. Plus some story ideas, but they&#39;re kinda spoilery. <br><br>By the way, the book is “Dirty Magic” by Jaye Wells, and I think it is part of a trilogy, but like I said before, I haven’t read the other two yet.

            <p>I should&#39;ve elaborated more on that post about what I&#39;m talking about. What I mean is the following:<br><br>My computer blocks DeviantArt, so I can&#39;t see any of that stuff you&#39;ve got so far. But since you say you don&#39;t know much about politics, I decided to send you that link because it&#39;ll probably have something that has to do with politics (can&#39;t be sure, as my search for the term &quot;politics&quot; turned up nothing, but there&#39;s probably something in there). Even if there&#39;s nothing for that question, there&#39;s also a lot of other world-building stuff (including pages about creating fantasy species and races) that could be useful to you. Hope this helps!<br><br>-Twistey</p>

<li>I&#39;m pretty sure that both Wattpad and Quotev let you get accounts for free. I think. They&#39;re online-based. I have a lot of friends who use one or both (and none of them are Lemmings, because I drive Lemmings nuts. Remember what Quotev is called on the Wiki? ;P)<br><br>2. That&#39;s not good.

            <p>Hello lovely people of the PPC Posting Board!<br><br>I am more or less new here, and I am not sure how to write a good introduction, but I figured I would like to introduce myself.<br><br>I found the PPC by pure chance, through an page of the wiki that I stumbled upon in the midst of a search for something only tangentially related. I was intrigued at once, and resolved to learn more about these mysterious Protectors of the Plot continuum. I read my way through the Original Series and poked my way through some of the wiki, and now I am announcing my presence here on the board.<br><br>I am currently in college studying computer science. When I am not busy with school, I enjoy reading (sometimes including fanfiction), singing, playing bassoon, and spending way too much time in a theater for my own good. <br><br>In general, I read mostly speculative fiction, tending more towards the fantasy and science fantasy than hard science fiction, but I read other stuff, too. I tend in a similar direction in terms of movies and TV shows with the added factor that I am fascinated by animation and a sucker for anything with pretty art. Recently I finished <i>The Haunting of Hill House</i> by Shirley Jackson and I am still somewhat obsessed, so if anybody wanted to talk about that I would be very excited. </p>

            <p>Hi there, Clersyn! I&#39;m Twistey, andOHMYGODYOUPLAYBASSOON?! I ALSO PLAY BASSOON! BASSOON BUDDIES! WOOOOOOOO!<br><br>Well then, now that I&#39;m done capslocking over an instrument (sorry about that &gt;w<br>So yeah, that&#39;s me. How about you? Any particular fandoms you&#39;re into? What do you plan to do with your time here at the PPC (what kinds of fics do you want to cover, spork vs MST vs other, etc)? Do you have any agent ideas? I&#39;d love to know more! :)<br><br>Finally, for your newbie gift, here is a chunk of a newly discovered fantasy substance. Careful, wait, you need to put these gloves on while handling it. Don&#39;t let it touch your skin. Okay, there you go. [You examine the medium-sized rock in your hands. It&#39;s a light rose-gold color, but sparkles in a way similar to mica, as if rubbing it with enough force will produce flecks. It&#39;s in an amorphous, jagged shape.] Try not to create any flecks, they&#39;ll do a lot of, er, unwanted magical things to you if you ingest them. If you stick around for long enough, you&#39;ll find out what this is and why it&#39;s dangerous. For now, keep it in an airtight glass display case, and guard it well if you have any unscrupulous friends. ;)<br><br>Anyway, nice to meet you! I hope you enjoy your time here, and welcome to the PPC!<br><br>-Twistey</p>

            <p>(Because I couldn&#39;t think of a subject line.)<br><br>1. Finicky creature indeed. Sometimes I can&#39;t even practice for some reason or other, and it&#39;s not because I don&#39;t take care of my instrument. Most recently, one of the keys had a sticky pad and it was causing a lot of my notes to be out of tune. It was annoying.<br><br>2. Ah, nice. Well, hopefully you might have ideas eventually. If not, you can still hang with us as a writing and beta-ing group.<br><br>3. Oh boy. I have been told so many times to watch Gravity Falls (among other things), but then I always end up forgetting to start. From the outside, it looks pretty cool, though, and like it had a lot of thought put into it with all the interesting puzzles they leave for the viewers to solve!<br><br>4. You can try to, but as far as I know it only does things to living beings (usually sapient beings, but it&#39;s been known to work on animals that are coincidentally popular in the media, such as wolves and dragons.) It doesn&#39;t cause any <i>physical</i> destruction, but if the wrong people have an effective enough plan to use it, it could end society as we know it. Through what, I&#39;ll wait to see if I can reveal. See if it does anything to objects it touches - I don&#39;t want anything unethical to happen (all my observations of its actions were based on circumstances outside my control), and I haven&#39;t done anything with objects yet.<br><br>-Twistey</p>

            <p>I meant to say something along these lines last week, but Christmas and paperwork for my new job got in the way. Not that you needed to know that.<br><br>Anyhow, after some thinking on... stuff, I decided I liked the prompt writing that went on a couple of weeks ago and decided to give people a new prompt and see how that goes. And, after some thinking, here it is:<br><br>&quot;When will I see you again?&quot;<br><br>Well go wild with it. Pour out your creative imaginations and see what you can come up with.

            <p>Quick key:<br>-Naergondir and Gurnirel are SIELU agents and Noldorin Elves of the First Age of Middle-earth (aka, Tolkien Elves of Dafydd&#39;s earlier days). Being Elves, they have a lot of names between them. Most do not appear here.<br>-Osellë=sworn sister (Quenya)<br>-Otorno=sworn brother (Quenya). Both are left untranslated even when they&#39;re presumably speaking Quenya because it gets very clunky.<br>-Aman and Valinor are the same place.<br><br>I&#39;m not sure yet if this is or will be canon at some point, but...you never know! It&#39;s certainly something I could see happening...let&#39;s call it canon-adjacent for now. Feedback welcome. Thank you also to the people who gave me feedback on the last prompt I did; I really appreciate it, and mainly didn&#39;t reply due to getting tired and sick until after it made its way off the front page. ~Z<br><br><br>---<br><br><br>&quot;You cannot leave.&quot; Naergondir moved nimbly to block the door. His one hand rested against the closest of the trees which, with a variety of other flora, filled their RC; his other he held out, as though to keep his partner at bay. &quot;<i>Osellë</i>, our place is here now. It must be.&quot;<br><br>Gurnirel hefted the pack onto her shoulders with a sigh. &quot;I will never be content to live out my years in this place, <i>otorno</i>,&quot; she said. Her voice was soft. &quot;Never. You know this.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Do you not think the Valar were clear?&quot; Naergondir stayed where he was. &quot;We are barred from Valinor, Gurnirel. This--this is what we are to do.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Is it?&quot; Gurnirel pulled her long golden braid out from under the pack, resettling it behind one shoulder. &quot;How can you be <i>certain</i>? How can you know that we were not merely sent here as a warning, as a sign that we must remain with the others of our kindred who are barred from Aman?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Surely here we may work towards forgiveness.&quot; Naergondir&#39;s throat ached as he spoke; he forced the words out anyway. &quot;We are protecting our kindred here, Saileldë, in a way that we never could before. Surely this will someday earn us a place in Valinor, if anything will. Surely--&quot;<br><br>&quot;I cannot believe that.&quot; Gurnirel began to walk toward him, skirting roots as she went. &quot;I will not. I tried, Naergondir. I did. But this is not our home, my home. This is not even our world. How can I stay here, a stranger, when my son yet lives in Middle-earth? When he is forced to play servant to Sue after Sue? I cannot remain here.&quot; She came to a stop in front of him. Their eyes met. &quot;Step aside, <i>otorno</i>. Come with me if you will; but do not attempt to stop me if you will not. For whether with you or alone, I am bound away.&quot;<br><br>&quot;And if this, as all else, should turn to evil end?&quot; Naergondir let his hand fall, but didn&#39;t step aside. &quot;We are the Dispossessed, Gurnirel. Are you so eager to shed more tears?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I would shed them in my home world,&quot; Gurnirel said. &quot;I would shed them where I can feel the eyes of the Valar on me.&quot; She reached out, clasping his shoulder. &quot;I have already shed them here,&quot; she said quietly. &quot;If I am to shed more--let it be in a land where I can see the sky and feel the ground.&quot;<br><br>For a time, they stood simply looking at one another. At last, Naergondir bowed his head and stepped aside.<br><br>&quot;May you find peace,&quot; he said. &quot;Bear my regards to your son, should he wish to hear them.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I shall do so.&quot; Gurnirel offered her hand; when Naergondir reached out to take it, she gripped his forearm in a warrior&#39;s clasp. &quot;May we meet again one day in Aman.&quot;<br><br>When she had gone, Naergondir stood among the tangle of trees and vines and stared at the door to the RC. The generic gray still appeared foreign to his eyes; even the flora that crowded their RC--his, now--was not entirely familiar.<br><br>&quot;When will I see you again?&quot; he murmured. &quot;What will befall us now we have left each other&#39;s company?&quot;<br><br>He half expected her to return, to open the door and explain that she had had a change of heart. That was not her way, though; it never had been. Once Gurnirel had made a decision, she did not easily alter it.<br><br>He turned away, running his fingers along bark and vines as he approached the console. Perhaps it would provide him with a mission; he was eager to return to protecting his kin.<br><br>(Perhaps she would be there now, the Vanyarin-blooded Noldo whose path had twisted with and diverged from his again and again throughout the First Age. She would no longer be able to see him if he didn&#39;t make his presence known--but that was the price to pay for protecting Arda from the disastrous effects of poor writing. And he had made his choice, just as she had now made hers.)<br><br><i>Please,</i> he thought. It wasn&#39;t quite a prayer; he was too fearful what might come of prayers to use them easily now. <i>Let this be the end. Let us earn forgiveness at last.</i><br><br>The Doom of Mandos rang in his ears, his only companion until--<br><br>[BEEEEEEP!]</p>

            <p>Well, it makes me feel awful to see them part like this.  I do appreciate that both are seeking a return to Vailnor, but have entirely different and irreconcilable views on how to do so.  I like that the decision feels final for both agents, that there are consequences for each stemming from the decisions on both ends, but that the agents still make their decisions and face what comes.

            <p>Seriously, thank you for your comments. Both this set and the ones from the previous prompt session are very nice to read. This one is especially nice because when I came up with the Calaquendi (...five years ago, eek), I originally struggled some with figuring out what they were actually like, what made them distinct from each other. I doubt I&#39;m done figuring it out, but it looks like at least a good chunk of what I <i>have</i> figured out came through here, so...thanks.<br><br>The plants...well. I went back to the first place that mentions them (a giant unfinished 50+ page mission that Lily and I were writing, which I might try to edit and finish since it does have a lot of things I like in it and the badfic is even still up)...it doesn&#39;t say there, of course, but there are definitely roots on the floor. I&#39;m going to say that some of them are in pots--flowers especially, and whatever&#39;s just been brought in--but for the most part they&#39;re...well, there&#39;s probably a dirt floor? Either that or they really are growing out of the generic surface, which I can&#39;t imagine would make the Calaquendi feel at all at home. Either way, they&#39;re mostly not in pots.<br><br>Also. Um. I&#39;m completely sure it was unintentional, but your one little question about the plants sparked a whole long thing that culminated in a new piece of plot being added to some interludes I was already working on and four pages of writing for it, all over the course of one evening. So. Um. Thank you? It&#39;s been one heck of a snowball, and I&#39;m pretty sure it&#39;s still rolling, to some extent (beyond the fact that I now have to figure out what happens <i>next</i>...)<br><br>Anyway. Thank you.<br><br>~Z</p>

            <p>My thanks to Delta Juliette and Calliope for beta-reading this prompt.<br><br> Marina Nicodelli was crouched on her bed in the Response Center. Her mini Yale was napping in his corner of the room, and her partner had left not long ago for a few days with with his family for Christmas. From the sound of it while Richard had been wrapping his presents, his home situation wasn&#39;t stellar. Not that there was something she could do about it. She had her own problems with Christmas to deal with. And she could do it better alone.<br><br>Problems which were pretty much summed up by the photo she was looking at the moment. It was one of the few mementos of her life she had left after the Fomorians had burned it to the ground and attempted to kill her.<br><br>She was barely in the background of the photo, a half-smile on her face. Not that she had been unhappy at having the opportunity of being with her family for Christmas; she had been quite happy at the idea of spending the holiday with them. Not having to worry about any sort of trouble or ritual prepared to take advantage of the holiday had been as good for her as possible.<br><br>But... Her little sister Felicia, pictured sitting down in front of her with a big grin on her face, had received the first season  of one of her favorite shows, <i>My Little Pony</i>, and she just had to start watching it as soon as possible, heedless of her older sister inside her anti-hexing circle. Marina had been unable to get out while Felicia cheered at her show. Marina sighed at the memory. At least Felicia had chosen a decent one to watch.<br><br>Next to the two sisters were their parents. Victor Nicodelli was fairly average at five-foot-eight, rather stout, with greying brown hair and a close-cropped beard, which was also turning grey. There was some subdued joy on his face and in his green eyes, like when he had taken her to a shooting range for the first time. He still looked rigid though, as if he had to be ready to spring to duty at any moment. He had been quite relieved nothing had happened on Christmas- it had waited for New Year&#39;s Eve. And trouble had been generous enough to involve Marina by making one of the suspects a ghoul.<br><br>Her mother had handled the resulting fallout as well as she could at the time. Namely, by putting up a good front for Felicia so she wouldn’t worry too. While she did that, she would ask herself once more why she had accepted her eldest daughter learn about magic rather than letting it go away. But none of that worry could be seen on the photo. Jessica Nicodelli was about six feet tall, with the same black hair as her daughters, although some white hair could be seen here and there. She had the same slender build as Marina, and a quiet presence that could be felt even through the picture.<br><br>Marina hadn&#39;t seen them for years now. She missed them, especially during the end of the year. Her master too, the old bear. John Riders. An americanization from his old name, back when he lived in Flanders.<br><br>The old man had been a stern master, and showed her how close she&#39;d been to the edge in that alley. Magic was not a toy- under his instruction she&#39;d witnessed the evils of black magic, and the terrors it inflicted. That the same old man had liked to read <i>Twilight</i> And <i>Fifty Shades of Gray</i> had left her rather dumbfounded. He would always laugh at the books before talking about how the standards of the White Court for ghostwriters had dropped in the last decades. Meyer certainly didn&#39;t compare to Stoker.<br><br>Marina lost herself in memories of him and her family for a while. Memories were all she had, for now. The C-CADs which had worked long enough to get a reading on her would constantly oscillate between ‘canon ‘verse’ and ‘RP setting’ regarding her origins. A pretty way of saying that as long as she didn’t know where to go back, she couldn’t go back home. And unless her… author wrote something about how things canonically were back in Philadelphia, it would remain that way until he ended the series.<br><br>Sure, she could probably live long enough to wait the end of the series out. She could probably even go back to the moment she had jumped for the Nevernever once the time for retirement had come. Or, more preferably, she would come back later, and away from her would-be killers. <br><br>But if things always went as expected, she wouldn’t have ended up facing what she had thought to be a psychotic junkie on her way back from school. It wouldn’t have ended up being a Renfield, a berserk thrall of Black Court Vampires. She wouldn’t have ended up crushing him to the ground with a power she didn’t understand yet. She wouldn’t have ended up discovering a world larger and more fascinating and dangerous as she thought. And she certainly wouldn’t have ended up discovering an even larger and more fascinating and dangerous one after that. <br><br>And if things went unexpectedly again, her family and her master would never be the wiser about it. Marina Nicodelli would be dead, in her office, or her apartment, or in an alley, or in the Nevernever. But she most certainly would not be killed in the service of some sort of multidimensional organization. An organization which looked at many, many universes as fictions, and fought eldritch abominations trying to make them fit their twisted desires.<br><br>But for now, all she could do was look at the picture and ask one question. “When can I see you again?”<br></p>

            <p>I enjoyed this one quite a bit.  I think this is the only story in the group to use the line from the prompt not in a conversation, but by a single person sitting alone.  And that gives it such a somber and lonely feeling that it really makes this one stand out from the others as unique.<br><br>I like how you use the structure of the photograph to not only introduce the main players in Marina&#39;s former life, but also to explain the magic system of that world a bit, and the types of danger she faced and feared.  (I also love the little detail that vampire thralls are called &quot;Renfields&quot; in that canon.)<br><br>A lot of PPC agents either choose not to visit their homes/families for whatever reason, or are able to fairly regularly.  I like the inherent conflict of an agent who would like to do so, but isn&#39;t able due to some instability of the multiverse.<br><br>—doctorlit would probably visit home a little out of guilt, but it&#39;s so easy to get caught up in work . . .</p>

            <p>The idea of a lonely scene felt rather normal to me when I started writing, and I didn&#39;t really see Marina wanting to talk that out with someone. She sees this situation as her problem, and one she cannot fix at the moment. The first version of the prompt didn&#39;t even use the line, only implying it. But Delta also pointed out it was a to short one, and once I expanded it, the line just flew in.<br><br>The additional bits I added along the photography&#39;s description also springed to mind while I was writing about her family, and were a fine way of fleshing up the prompt in my mind... once I got the sentences to be less clunky. And well, Marina has been moving away from normality from the day she discovered about magic. PPC is only taking this journey further than even the Dresdenverse could manage.<br><br>Renfield is a modern moniker for a special breed of thralls. Bottom line of that worldbuilding bit: Black Court Vampires are a breed of pretty much Stoker vampires, except they look like super zombies rather than unaturally beautiful, and naturally got hit hard when everyone could get their hands on a book describing all their tricks and weaknesses, and the White Court is a rival breed of vampires, psychic predators preying on lust, fear, despair... Renfields take their name from the madman of Dracula, and are thralls with their minds so ravaged they become crazed berserkers, and only got worst from there, not lasting long before they go on a pretty much self-destructive rampage. They&#39;re &#39;as good as&#39; dead the moment their mind got shredded enough to earn that moniker.<br><br>I have to thank Desdendelle for the last point. When I asked for Permission for the first time, Marina was still a character I had designed for a Dresden Files RP settled in Philadelphia, and the setting I created wasn&#39;t quite identic to Real World, something he pointed out. Tweaking her backstory to bring it back to Real Life Philadelphia did put her somewhere between &#39;canon&#39; and &#39;RP character&#39; in my mind. Meaning that Butcher hadn&#39;t written anything about the situation in Dresdenverse!Philadelphia, so she doesn&#39;t contradict canon... unless Butcher does write about Philadelphia (no clue about this ever happening though). <br><br>I figured out it would be a good idea to reflect this with her having instable home &#39;verse. It would also make a good initial justification for her staying in the PPC rather than trying to go back home. Not everyone falling into a plothole want to stay, but not everyone can go back either.</p>

            <p>AN: Right! I basically used this prompt as an excuse to have a bit of &quot;fun&quot; with some ideas I&#39;ve had around for a little while. I did my best to ensure this makes canonical sense for 40k, but facts about Prospero are light on the ground, and I am bad at research. So I didn&#39;t have a ton to work with. OTOH, I didn&#39;t have a ton of constraints, either. I&#39;m mostly worried I screwed something I don&#39;t know about up, but I don&#39;t think I did.<br><br>Thank you to Nesh for making some very helpful suggestions that made this story a lot better, to &#39;Plith for helping double-check that it makes canon sense, and to, Quincy, Granz, and Calliope for giving it a once-over and checking to ensure I hadn&#39;t lost my mind, at least from a people-not-overly-familiar-with-40k-canon-who-just-want-a-neat-story perspective.<br><br>With that over with, on to the story proper:<br>~~~~<br><br>“I don’t know if you ever will. But if so... it won’t be like this. I’m sorry.”<br><br>“I didn’t believe it, at first. That you were really going. I had the utmost faith in you, but—”<br><br>“No. You thought I would fail.”<br><br><br>“Kann—”<br><br>“Don’t deny it. I can <i>see</i> it, clear as day.”<br><br>“Kann, please.”<br><br>“There’s no shame in your lack of belief. It’s rare for anyone to be chosen. And I’m far from perfect. You, of all people, would know that. To have that faith in me would have made you a fool.”<br><br>[Pause]<br><br>“Why are you doing this to me, Kann?”<br><br><br>“...Because I’m afraid, Erek. I’m terrified of leaving you. And maybe if I pretend I can’t feel it, the pain will stop.”<br><br>“I understand that, I think. But… please. Stop trying to hurt me. Because I can see how much it’s tearing you up. And I’m afraid too.”<br><br>“You have little to fear.”<br><br>“I’m about to lose you.”<br><br>“You’ll find someone else.”<br><br>“Not you.”<br><br>“...No. Not me.”<br><br>“Kann… don’t go. Not yet. I want you with me.”<br><br>“I leave at daybreak. Until then...”<br><br>“Until then, we are together?”<br><br>“Of course. For as long as I can manage.”<br><br>[...Time Passes...]<br><br>“This really is the end then.”<br><br>“I have to go. I don’t want to, but I have to.”<br><br>“It is an honor, I suppose.”<br><br>“Being chosen to serve the Emperor… it is the greatest honor. But sometimes, I wonder if it’s worth giving you up. Not that I could turn it down if I wanted to.”<br><br>“...I love you, Kannan.”<br><br>“And I love you, Erek.”<br><br>“Should I ever see you again… will you at least greet me?”<br><br>“Of course, Erek. If I can, I’ll do that for you.”<br><br>---<br><br>“Thoth?”<br><br>The Thousand Son now known as Thoth looked up. “What is it you wish, Tom?”<br><br>Tom took his head out of his book to look at his partner. “I was just wondering… what was it like, being chosen to be a Space Marine?”<br><br>Thoth was silent for a moment. “I was more than a boy, at least. Many are chosen to join the Astartes sooner than I was. Although the training in my powers had begun long before that, as it did for all children gifted with such things upon Prospero.” There was another pause. “I began my training, and I left my life behind. That is what you do, when you are chosen.”<br><br>“Did it hurt? Leaving your home?”<br><br>“...No,” Thoth said. For a brief instant, Tom thought he saw a hint of… something in the marine’s eye. Sadness, or regret, maybe. But it could have just been a trick of the light.<br><br>~~~~<br>Disclaimers: Thoth, Tom, and Erek are mine, The Laundry Files belongs to Charles Stross (it never really shows up here, but Tom&#39;s from there... just being safe), Warhammer 40k, Prospero, The Thousand Sons, and so on belong to Games Workshop, and the PPC, of course, belongs to Jay and Acacia, in the trust of the PPC Board and the PGs held therein.</p>

            <p>This is indeed well done.  I&#39;m not really one for romantic/caring/emotional dialogue like this, but you really used some good language in the speech here to make it interesting and attention-holding.<br><br>I also see the implied reason for why Agent Thoth is suppressing the story of his former love.  At least when he was still employed by the Empreror, he was in the same universe as Erek, and potentially could have seen him ever so rarely.

            <p>If you know 40k, you can understand/infer the rest of the reasons it might hurt. Erek either died long ago in peace, or was a casualty in The Burning of Prospero, which was the final straw that lead Thoth&#39;s legion to join Chaos (not exactly willingly... it&#39;s complicated). Not to mention all the repression Space Marines have of all sorts of emotional stuff, which means any meetings they may have had would have been painful.</p>

            <p><b>Author&#39;s Note:</b>  I.  Uh.  I don&#39;t know why a story like <i>this</i> even came to me, it just . . . did.  I&#39;m so sorry.<br><br>Warning for alcohol use.<br><br>* * *
<br><br>Bob shifted a bit, trying to straighten himself in his chair.  An awful ringing was sounding in his ears, thought he had no clue when, exactly, it had started.<br><br>Wait . . . ringing?<br><br>BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEP!<br><br>Not ringing, not in his ears.  &quot;Console,&quot; he muttered, his throat feeling tight and phlegmy.  &quot;Mission.&quot;<br><br>Bob&#39;s forehead suddenly smarted with pain, as the lip of a glass bottle had tapped him there, quite strongly.  &quot;Vat?  Vat iz dis you are talking apout?  Mission?  Dare iz no mission for you, but to talking mit me, here.&quot;<br><br>Bob scrunched up his brow.  The console was clearly BEEPing . . . wasn&#39;t it?  Although, come to think of it, his head did hurt quite a bit.  And the slightly echoed, hollow rumble of the Angel&#39;s voice rather muddied the sound in his ears.  Still, though: &quot;The light is red, though . . .&quot;<br><br>&quot;Humph!&quot; replied the Angel.  &quot;Vot are ve caring vor de colors of lights?  Ve are a pair of revined gentlemen, holding proper discourse mit each other, yes?&quot;<br><br>Bob forced his vision to focus on the creature sitting atop his RC&#39;s card table.  It was a bit difficult, because his vision listed just a bit to the left, and because the Angel&#39;s rum cask body, beer keg legs, and wine bottle arms blended in so well with the table&#39;s layout.  &quot;My . . . my job, though . . . A mission . . .&quot;<br><br>&quot;Vy you are not pe in condition for mission!  Hu!  Hu!  Hu!  You are pe very dronk, mein friend!  He!  He!  He!  Here, haf yourself a little of de water.&quot;  And the Angel refilled Bob&#39;s glass from one of its arm bottles labeled &quot;Kirschenwasser.&quot;<br><br>Bob grinned and downed the clear liquid, expecting water, but delighted to find it tasted of cherries.  &quot;Thank you, Angel,&quot; he sighed, &quot;You&#39;re such a good—&quot;<br><br>The door to the RC slammed open.  <i>Here it is!</i>  The security dandelion fired a shot from a wide-barreled firearm, launching a large net through the air.<br><br>The Angel must have been far more nimble than its body would seem to allow, as from Bob&#39;s perspective, the net <i>should</i> have found its mark.  However, it only managed to snap closed over some of the inanimate beverage containers near the Angel, taking them off the table to shatter onto the floor.<br><br><i>Plan B, please.</i><br><br>&quot;On it!&quot; a DIA agent yelled as she stepped through behind the Weed.  &quot;Angel of the Odd, you are under arrest!&quot;  She lobbed a yellow-and-black ball at the table.  The ball split open and shot red energy at the Angel.<br><br>The Angel clearly wasn&#39;t expecting any more success from this attempt than from the previous one.  When the red energy reached him and began pulling him back into the ball, he uttered a &quot;Mein Gott!&quot; before the ball closed over him.<br><br>The ball fell to the floor.  It shook once.<br><br>The security team stared.<br><br>It shook again.<br><br>Bob stared.<br><br>It shook a third time.<br><br>&quot;All right!&quot;  The DIS agent moved to pick up the ball.  &quot;Contact the Captain and have him tell Bellman Next we&#39;ve—&quot;<br><br>The ball burst open and the Angel of the Odd skittered across the floor.<br><br>&quot;—got her pagerunner.&quot;  She picked up the Poké Ball, its hinge swinging uselessly open.<br><br><i>He&#39;s using the console!</i> the Weed moved across the RC on its roots, but the Angel of the Odd had already stopped the alarm and opened a portal.<br><br>&quot;Wait, Angel!&quot; Bob slurred.  &quot;When will I see you again?&quot;<br><br>Jumping nimbly through the dandelion&#39;s vines, the Angel laughed.  &quot;He!  He!  He!  Vy, te Angel ov te Odd is alvays mit you!  Any time you be find a strange accident iz be ruining your day, there I be!&quot;  He escaped out the portal, which snapped shut behind him.<br><br>&quot;Nooo,&quot; Bob murmured.  &quot;Angeeel!&quot;  He stretched across the table, reaching for the closed portal, and sending bottle and glasses clattering down around his head as he came to rest face-down on the table.<br><br>&quot;Seriously, dude.  Get some help.&quot;<br><br>* * *

            <p>I guess I would have enjoyed it even more if I had read Edgar Allen Poe’s version first.<br><br>Apparently Poe picked up some German words, but then he misremembered or he didn’t learn the construction rules for compound nouns. The alcoholic beverage distilled from cherries (&quot;Kirschen&quot;, singular &quot;Kirsche&quot;) is called &quot;Kirschwasser&quot; and the alcoholic beverage distilled from raspberries (&quot;Himbeeren&quot;, singular &quot;Himbeere&quot;) is called &quot;Himbeergeist&quot;. <br><br>But if the spirit is distilled from pears (&quot;Birnen&quot;, singular &quot;Birne&quot;), it is called &quot;Birnengeist&quot; or &quot;Birnenschnaps&quot;, so we don’t always use the singular and drop a trailing &quot;e&quot;? German is a weird language. <br><br>And I just realized that &quot;kirschwasser&quot; would be an English word, too, although simply &quot;kirsch&quot; is more usual (and is not cherry brandy). <br><br>HG, <b>not</b> longing for a drink now    </p>

            <p>This is a very different story from anything else I&#39;ve read, and it made for a very interesting read.  You&#39;ve really done an incredible job of seeding this narrative with little bits and pieces of world-building detail, but only enough to inform the reader that we aren&#39;t looking at humans in an Earth setting.  You don&#39;t slow the action or dialogue down with excess details like the descriptions of the characters or the society they live in or the magic system that (maybe?) exists.  With all those questions essentially forced under the rug, it leads the reader to focus more on the parts of the story that really matter: the relationships between the characters and their emotions—in other words, how human they are.  Reading a story this way was a very unique experience, and it made the ending hit even harder.<br><br>One little nitpick, regarding this pair of paragraphs:<br><br>&quot;&#39;Dantril’s brought in someone new. We’ll see, Lath,&#39; she said. &#39;We’ll see.&#39;<br><br>&#39;I know you want me to have all the answers, but I don’t,&#39; she said, when he didn’t respond. &#39;I wish I knew, too. But we can’t, Lath. We aren’t gods.&#39;&quot;<br><br>I suggest moving the &quot;when he didn&#39;t respond&quot; to the front of that second paragraph, as the start of a new paragraph and new quotation mark tricked my brain into thinking Lath was speaking it.<br><br>—doctorlit, sleepy, but still getting through these reviews</p>

            <p>((Thank you, Calliope mah dahling, for betawork!))<br><br><br><br><br><br>The End-of-Year Feast at Beauxbatons was something else. Mason couldn&#39;t help but smile, seeing the tables slowly filling with solid gold bowls, dishwares, and plates the size of police shields, all containing one delicious food after another. He could see various types of roasted meat, grilled vegetables, boards of cheese and baskets of bread, big pots of aromatic stews... Despite the last night&#39;s celebration at the Hogwarts&#39; quarters, everybody seemed to have room for more food. After all, it was the last day, all the important guests had already gathered, and the 2014 Triwizard Tournament was about to officially end.<br><br>Looking over at the Hogwarts guest section, Mason saw his friends in their usual environment. Paul and Oscar were too busy stuffing their faces and quite animatedly discussing something. Next to them was Lydia, who met Mason&#39;s gaze and gave him an excited two-thumbs-up! He wasn&#39;t exactly sure why, seeing as their school came out of the competition tying with the host for the exact number of points, so could it really be considered a second place?<br><br>Over at the Champions&#39; table discussions also kept on going. Mason noticed on his left Gentry de Saint-Germain speaking vigorously to Headmaster Colbert. The man was seemingly letting his students talk out all of his problems and issues (at least that&#39;s how Mason saw it), but it seemed like he was dozing off a little bit, almost dumping his elbow into a bowl of stew. On his right, Mason saw Alva Krieger calmly eating her breakfast. She and Headmistress Borisova weren&#39;t talking much, subtly ignoring other guests by answering their questions with one or two short words.<br><br>Mason smiled. Both Gentry and Alva were fierce competitors, and he couldn&#39;t have picked better people to give him a run for his Galleons. Then, by the end, if it wasn&#39;t for them, he would certainly be in a worse condition than a broken arm. He looked at Headmistress McGonagall but found her chatting with the French Minister for Magic, and therefore decided it wouldn&#39;t be the smartest idea to interrupt them.<br><br>After the Feast has finally ended, and the official and unofficial goodbyes were exchanged, the students from the visiting schools started gathering by their designed modes of transportation. The Durmstrang ship was ready to sail, and the Hogwarts Express’s whistle rang once again. While exiting the gates of the school, the guests were led by a water salute that sprouted out of the Flamel Fountain. The statues of both Nicolas and Perenelle shot out water from their wands, which turned into a breeze that fell onto both groups of students, who were now laughing and squealing as they rushed towards their vehicles.<br><br>&#39;Hey, Branwen!&#39; Mason turned around and saw Alva and Gentry standing behind him. Some of the students from others schools were giving them passing looks, or whispering to each other. Alva was holding the Triwizard Cup above her head, and Gentry had the same smug smile the first time the three of them were gathered together. He was repelling the water droplets with a sort of invisible umbrella.<br><br>&#39;Leaving? Vithout zaying <i>au-revoir?</i>&#39; Gentry asked. &#39;Oh, &#39;onestly, Mason, vere are your manners?&#39;<br><br>&#39;Well, I was considering ditching you two at breakfast, but the vision of food was too tempting,&#39; Mason replied, giving them a sly grin.<br><br>&#39;Truly, an English gentleman to the core.&#39; Alva rolled her eyes and both of them stepped closer. Almost at the same time they&#39;d extended their fists.<br><br>&#39;So?&#39; she continued. &#39;When are we seeing you again?&#39;<br><br>&#39;You&#39;re not gezing rid of us zat easily, <i>mon ami</i>,&#39; Gentry added.<br><br>Mason stared at their gesture. He then sighed and bumped their fists with his only available arm. &#39;I&#39;ll be there, whenever either of you gets into trouble.&#39;<br><br>&#39;You rock, Branwen.&#39; Alva moved closer and kissed him on the cheek. &#39;But don&#39;t get cocky,&#39; she whispered into his ear before adjusting her fur coat and leaving the boys behind.<br><br>Gentry was first to regain his speech. And his smug smile. &#39;Vell, vell, vell...&#39;<br><br>&#39;Say one more word, Frenchie… One more word, I dare you!&#39;</p>

            <p>((All Beta&#39;d by Larf except the ending.))<br><br>&quot;When&#39;ll you be back then?&quot; Kara asked, worried.<br><br>&quot;Relax, Kar! Daichi&#39;s just going to scout out this place, we&#39;ll be able to take the Sue in a bit.&quot; he smirked, unfazed by the dangerous world around him.<br><br>&quot;Okay. . .&quot; Kara sighed. &quot;Don&#39;t do anything stupid, you hear?&quot;<br><br>Daichi chuckled and started walking. &quot;Daichi&#39;s not going to do anything silly, don&#39;t worry Mum!&quot;<br><br> <i>I&#39;m not that old.</i> Kara smirked.  <i>Not sure why we grew to like each other as partners. By all means, I should&#39;ve hated him.</i><br><br>Kara sat down at their campfire, and made sure everything was in order, that no forest fire was going to start like the last time she entrusted a campfire to Daichi. She looked up to the stars produced by the Words - she would&#39;ve started counting them, but examining the odd way in which they were described proved to be more interesting, she could&#39;ve sworn the stars had eyes. It was odd, indeed, sparkling eyes that kept blinking. It seemed like every eye was fixated on something and nothing at the same time. Kara wasn&#39;t sure whether to be horrified or fascinated.<br><br>Dusk was soon to give way to night, the whole forest seemed to have gone to sleep. The whole forest. . . except Kara. She wanted to wait just a bit longer for Daichi - something felt terribly wrong, like a knife to the chest. The &#39;stars&#39; in the sky started tearing, emulating rain -<br> it made it impossible for Kara to search for Daichi.<br><br> <i>Just hit the hay already, we&#39;ve been at this for years, Daichi&#39;s fine.</i> Kara twisted and turned in her makeshift bed.  <i>He&#39;s fine you crazy old lady. He&#39;s fine. He&#39;s got to be fine.</i> <br><br>After hours of twisting and turning, hours of convincing herself Daichi was fine, hours of imagining all the horrible things that could&#39;ve went wrong, Kara managed to sleep.<br><br>To her delight - it would&#39;ve been surprising if it wasn&#39;t a Word World - she woke up to a bright, sunny day. With an air of optimism, even the sun itself winked at her. Although, now that it was in broad daylight, it was quite the harrowing sight. Kara made a mental note not to look at the sky anymore.<br><br>Just as she was about to settle into her usual groove, she looked over at Daichi&#39;s bed and panicked, she looked left to right but. . . Daichi was nowhere to be seen. <i>Oh my. . where is he? He should&#39;ve been back by now. . .  maybe he&#39;s ju-</i> <br><br>Her thoughts were interrupted by a yelp in the distance. <br><br> <i>It can&#39;t be. . . </i> Kara&#39;s adrenaline levels spiked, her mind was going haywire. <br><br>She wasn&#39;t thinking. She was moving. The trees around her turned into a blur. Her eyes barely kept up with how fast she was going. She saw Daichi. She saw blood.<br><br>Daichi was gasping for air, a Suvian sword impaled into his chest. He couldn&#39;t move. The best he could do was tilt his head slightly, coughing up blood in the process, to look at Kara. Shocked didn&#39;t even come close to describing her, no word could come close to describing how she was feeling nor how she looked. She sat next to Daichi and held his hand, hoping that would somehow pull the sword out of him, that this was all a horrible nightmare.<br><br>&quot;K-kara. . .&quot; Daichi blurted. &quot;Daichi&#39;s not going to. . . die, right? Daichi&#39;s going to be. . .  okay, right?&quot; his eyes were dull, he wasn&#39;t even looking at Kara anymore.<br><br>&quot;You&#39;ll be okay, Daich. I promise!&quot; Kara was doing her best to soothe him. &quot;J-just hang in there. . . hang in there. . . please.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Daichi&#39;s not feeling... Daichi&#39;s not feeling so well. . . don&#39;t leave. . . Daichi. . . please.&quot; he pleaded, not knowing Kara&#39;s state.<br><br>&quot;I&#39;m not leaving, Daichi! We&#39;re partners. . . partners &#39;til the end. . . come on. . . just hang in there for me.&quot; Kara cried out.<br><br>Daichi moved his hand to touch Kara&#39;s cheek, still not looking at her. &quot;I think. . . I think this is the end, Kara.&quot; a slight smiled formed on his face. &quot;It&#39;s been. . . fun. . . being partners. Sorry. . . I couldn&#39;t&#39;ve been a better. . . a better partner. . .&quot; Daichi&#39;s hand fell limply. He took his last breath.<br><br>Kara wanted to say something, anything. . . but all she could do was sob. Sit there, blame herself, and cry. <br><br>She was alone. . .<br><br>Alone again.</p>

            <p>This piece does a great job of completely subverting expectations from the beginning versus the end.  The opening feels like the same carefree banter from any mission.  Kara&#39;s reassurances to herself set the reader up to assume Daichi does turn out to be okay.<br><br>The use of the eyes in the stars and sun is fun, because it kind of mirrors the change in tone just before the change occurs: Kara first finds the eye-stars kind of interesting to look at, if weird.

Daichi was nowhere to be seen.&quot;<br>You&#39;ve got two separate clauses here.

            <p>So I like the stylistic choices you were making in the end. Those really brought to life the desperation and the emotion Kara was feeling. You have some syntax I frown upon- in particular, the &quot;don&#39;t worry Mum!&quot; in the 4th line looks to me like it should be &quot;don&#39;t worry, Mum!&quot; Other than that, I really like it! It starts of pretty typical PPC, then it&#39;s got some foreshadowing, and it ends with a pretty big punch. I like it :D</p>

            <p>Okay, this is not a bad piece. Despite several initials grammar things (or it might just be me being an ESL again), I do like it. Short and creative, especially the jabs taken at the descriptions (I did geniuenly chuckled at the winking Sun... Ughh... creepy). Maybe a little too short, but it always has room for more.<br><br>There could&#39;ve been a little more to Kara&#39;s feelings themselves, instead of just stating the obvious. Especially the &quot;Shocked didn&#39;t even come close to describing her&quot; part made me think &#39;Actually, there is some things you could describe her&#39;. Maybe she felt cold, seeing the gruesome scene. Maybe her hands started trembling. Maybe she felt a sour taste in her mouth, holding down a retch. Maybe tears were already rolling down her eyes, as if she knew what was going to happen, despite telling herself otherwise. <br><br>Overall, as much as I don&#39;t like sad scenes, I don&#39;t mind this. You have your idea and you have your established characters. Nothing stops you from doing it! Just like the great Jedi Master Shia said: JUST! DO IT!</p>

They chat with each other while Radin keeps smiling. He keeps an interest on their chat though. He can’t understand most of what they are talking about, a dragon and a ball or something.

            <p>I like the way you use a lot of short, fast sentences, both for narration and dialogue.  It gives the story a fast flow, which not only matches with the topic of racing, but also feels like a natural way for young kids to talk to each other.  The present tense adds to that, too.<br><br>I also like that even though the main plot point of this story is one of competition, the runners are all very friendly towards, and supportive of, each other.

Even though &quot;being&quot; looks like a verb, it actually needs another verb in front of it.  So it would read &quot;people are being eaten&quot;.<br><br>&quot;House Red gains the highest marks and <b>are</b> accorded the main prize hamper.&quot;<br>Since this sentence uses House Red as its subject instead of the people in House Red, it should use a singular verb: &quot;House Red . . . is accorded the . . .&quot;<br><br>—doctorlit was never a fan of the field days back in grade school</p>

            <p>AN: This concerns one of my TYH characters who may show up in a proper fic at some point. For now, here&#39;s his opening story. <br><br>===<br><br>DMSE&amp;R&#39;s halls were a forbidding place. Perhaps it was a trick of the eye, perhaps it was psychosomatic, but even the slab-sided walls of Generic Surface seemed darker and more claustrophobic than anywhere else in HQ. Occasionally there would be a doctor or two wandering past, fresh from conducting medical experiments in front of live audiences of students frantically taking notes with stationery stained with glitter. The overall effect of the teaching hospitals was akin to Emily The Strange taking over Lisa Frank, a pairing that the DBS had dealt with on multiple occasions (to no-one&#39;s great surprise).<br><br>As another class filed out into the corridors, talking about the lecture and brushing errant red sparkles off their jackets, an unlikely figure pushed through them. He was a human boy of around fourteen, though his exact age was difficult to determine. The manner of his dress was unusual too; with his buff overcoat, dark green jacket, cream waistcoat, white muslin shirt, elaborately knotted cravat, top boots, stout cane, and actual honest-to-God pantaloons, he looked like he had stepped out of a Jane Austen novel. The primary reason for this was because he had done exactly that -- or at least, he would have done, had Jane Austen been given to writing urban fantasy novels.<br><br>As he made his way slowly through the crowd, the lecturer espied a blank space where would normally be a head, or at the very least some intimidating manner of pseudopodia. He made his way through the crowd and bade the lad a good morning, greeting him with the forced airiness and overfamiliarity that characterises interaction between the old and the young. The lecturer, whose dangling security pass read Dr. Ian Greville as much for his own benefit as that of anyone else, directed the young man surely through the crowd and down a long and ill-lit set of stairs. He laid an arm around the boy&#39;s shoulders and gave no indication that it caused obvious disquiet.<br><br>Several security doors, a few passwords, and three different DNA samples later, Dr. Greville took his leave, clapping the boy heartily on the shoulder as he did so. It is to be hoped that the Doctor did not notice him brush that shoulder and roll it gently, as if removing an ache from it; if he did, as with his earlier preoccupation with seeming fatherly rather than being respectful, he made not the slightest show of it.<br><br>The young man walked hesitantly down the corridor, the silver heel of his dark oak walking-cane clicking nervously past beds with unearthly occupants kept behind closed blue hospital curtains of cheap and non-specific manufacture. Occasionally, they twitched as he walked past; he did not start at such times, but the sum of it caused a bead of sweat to appear at his brow. He dabbed at it with a handkerchief but did not stop to do so; such expressions were a weakness that might be exploited, were his enemies given the option. While it might be thought odd that a boy of his obvious youth should be so concerned with those that should do him harm, he had done the majority of his growing-up in a very short space of time and surrounded by peers who had done so in even less.<br><br>The time came. He stopped and waited by the blue curtains for a heartbeat, then two, then three. A sharp rap of his cane produced a loud knock, most unusually for curtains of even the thickest manufacture but quite normal for the plates of Generic Surface behind them. The curtains pulled back and revealed a door, as well as a small slot for his finger. One brief sting and a &quot;DNA Verified&quot; later, he knocked again.<br><br>&quot;Door&#39;s open~! Teehee!&quot;<br><br>And suddenly it was, the twin panels sliding into the wall with a contented-sounding hiss. They revealed a four-poster bed with hot pink furnishings and glittering gold and silver curtains, a small wardrobe, and a mirror with a slogan of some description written on it in lipstick of the same violently red hue as the electric signage outside an Amsterdam brothel. Sat on the side of the bed was a slender woman, heavily made up with too-dark eyeshadow over too-pale foundation and with lips of a neon purple hue that matched the streak in her jet-black, feathery hair. Her enormous bosom was crammed into a bright pink T-shirt (possibly with the aid of three stout longshoremen wielding crowbars) while over it she wore a short leather jacket; to complete the outfit, she wore grey denim trousers of a fit that made inexpressibles look positively Puritan and neon-pink ankle boots, the backs of which were covered in silver studs, including the stiletto heels. At his entry, she beamed, and rushed over to give the young man a hug as he stepped inside, the door locking behind him.<br><br>&quot;Sweetie! I didn&#39;t realize you were coming over today!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Mother,&quot; the young man said stiffly.<br><br>&quot;Aw, I <i>told</i> you, call me Lily or Anna~! Or both! That&#39;s my name, after all~! Mother makes me look over my shoulder, y&#39;dig?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Nevertheless,&quot; he said, &quot;I feel... uncomfortable calling you anything else, Mother. I am sorry if this slights you.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Oh, you <i>so</i> get that from your dad.&quot; Lilianna sat down heavily on the bed again, kicking her legs out in a petulant manner. &quot;An&#39; I told you, don&#39;t apologise. &#39;S&#39;not like you did anything wrong, A.&quot;<br><br>&quot;If you insist.&quot;<br><br>Lilianna patted the side of the bed next to her. &quot;Siddown, boi~! Mama&#39;s got some catchin&#39; up to do!&quot;<br><br>The young man took of his coat and hung it neatly on the mirror&#39;s stand, careful not to let it touch the lipstick. He then took the indicated seat, his cane resting on the pink duvet.<br><br>&quot;Soooooo? What&#39;s cookin&#39;, good lookin&#39;~? That, by the way? That&#39;s <i>all</i> my side. Only thing of your dad&#39;s in you is his dress sense, which, like, is <i>suuuuuper</i> uncool. Guess ya gotta expect that from someone who called their kid Agamemnon. No offence.&quot;<br><br>Agamemnon forced himself not to roll his eyes. &quot;You gave none, Mother. Your words are kindness itself, as always.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Aww, you&#39;re such a sweetheart, A~! You get that from me too!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Indeed, Mother.&quot;<br><br>&quot;So, whatcha wanna talk about? Oooh, are ya having girl trouble? Don&#39;t do anything Mama wouldn&#39;t do~! <i>Wink</i>!&quot; Lilianna favoured him with a shining white grin.<br><br>&quot;... No, Mother, though your concern for my romantic wellbeing is touching.&quot; Agamemnon fought another urge, this time to back away at ever-increasing speed. &quot;I... that is to say, Father and I... we have some questions on a subject, and we were hoping you might be so good as to favour us with answers.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Ohhhh, now I get it! Your dad&#39;s stuck on another magic problem, isn&#39;t he~? Y&#39;know, for a guy with as many books as he has, he doesn&#39;t read a whole bunch, does he? The answer&#39;s prolly in those. Has he tried the Book of Shadows? Of course not. He can&#39;t read it, because he&#39;s not part of my family, and I&#39;m <i>preeeeeeetty</i> sure he&#39;s not the daughter of the Moon Goddess. Teehee!&quot;<br><br>Agamemnon forced a laugh; more of a bark really, but Lilianna failed to discern the difference and smiled at him anyway, laughing like a mountain stream (gurgling, and with fluid in uncomfortable places) all the while.<br><br>Eventually, Agamemnon made himself speak again. &quot;I shall recommend that to Father the next time a problem of some such nature arises. However, it is a question of an entirely separate nature with which I come to you.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Oh? Is it where babies come from?&quot; Lilianna&#39;s gaze grew sultry, and she leaned in to run a finger over his cheek. &quot;&#39;Cause, y&#39;know, if you weren&#39;t my baby I could <i>show</i> you, baby bo-&quot;<br><br>&quot;It concerns my childhood!&quot;<br><br>There was silence for a moment. Agamemnon had a fearful air about him, and it was a few moments before he noticed he had stood up; indeed, he had leaped to his feet as if assailed with hot needles and his skin was ashen. He could still feel the finger on his cheek, even as Lilianna pouted at him from the bed with a hurt expression and a gleam in her eye he told himself was just glitter, just glitter.<br><br>He sat down again, hurriedly attempting to compose himself. &quot;It concerns my childhood, Mother. And I am... sorry, for starting at your touch.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I told ya, kiddo, don&#39;t apologise.&quot; She then let out an odd false cough that Agamemnon furiously told himself sounded like anything other than the word &#39;prude&#39;. &quot;Anyway, I can definitely help with that. Shoot!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Well...&quot; Agamemnon crossed and uncrossed his legs, then caught himself, glaring at them until they stilled. &quot;I am afraid I don&#39;t remember the least thing about it. Nor does Father, I am afraid to say.&quot;<br><br>Lilianna raised her eyes heavenward in supplication. &quot;Ugh. Yeah, of course <i>he</i> won&#39;t remember anything about it. He&#39;s a totally self-obsessed narcissistic douchenoodle. And he&#39;s way worse at magic than me. And he&#39;s way worse at everything than me.&quot;<br><br>Agamemnon could not speak, and merely nodded. The muscles in his neck were so tense their shape could be seen through his collar and mildly distorted the shape of his cravat.<br><br>&quot;But yeah,&quot; Lilianna continued, &quot;while your dad was busy being super lame, you had a happy childhood with me~! We did eeeeeeverything together. I watched you climb trees in Arendelle-&quot;<br><br>&quot;Perenelle,&quot; Agamemnon corrected out of habit, then looked up in carefully-hidden fright.<br><br>&quot;-Whatever. I watched you dance in balls, I watched you run around and play... all that good stuff. Like I said, we did everything together~! We even bathed together. Ooh, now <i>there&#39;s</i> a little somethin&#39; I could stand to try again.&quot; She leaned in towards him again, licking her lips, dull, mottled pink on vivid purple.<br><br>All colour drained from Agamemnon&#39;s face, and he reached into his pocket and set off a small beeper. &quot;Ah! My alarm!&quot; He spoke quickly, each word scurrying out of his mouth like a hunted rabbit. &quot;I fear I have utterly lost track of time, Mother. I have class to attend and Mr. Figgis is most unkind to late-comers! I beg your indulgence in letting me take my belongings and leave?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Oh, sure! If ya gotta go, ya gotta go. Hurry baaaack, pretty boy mine!&quot;<br><br>&quot;You may depend upon it,&quot; said Agamemnon, inwardly cursing his politeness. Even without her influencing his mind, he found it near-impossible to say no to her. He quickened his pace, ignoring the smudge of lipstick on the lapel of his overcoat and the tremble of his hand as he reached for his cane. The DNA lock beeped again and the door hissed open, though it had taken him a few tries to provide the blood sample, so chill were his veins.<br><br>&quot;Kiddo. Can I be serious for a moment?&quot;<br><br>Just as he was about to leave, her tone made Agamemnon stop and turn to face her.<br><br>&quot;When... when are ya gonna come visit again?&quot;<br><br><i>When you&#39;re better. When I&#39;m better. When you&#39;re a kind mother from a fairy tale, not a Suvian in season from a past that only theoretically existed. When I&#39;ve put it off for long enough. When I&#39;ve steeled myself enough for it. When I don&#39;t think it will hurt as much as the last time, or the time before, or the time before.</i><br><br>&quot;Soon,&quot; he replied.<br><br>Lilianna sat on the bed after the door closed, listening to the boy&#39;s stick click, click, click away.</p>

            <p>This story does a good job of leaving the reader with uncomfortable questions that really can&#39;t be answered.  I still can&#39;t tell if Lilianna is meant to be a Sue, with Agamemnon and his father getting recruited from her story and her being studied as a specimen; or if she&#39;s a former agent who got Suefluenced and is being cared for the Medical Research Division, with her family members waiting for her recovery.  That level of speculation is tricky to create in a story so short, so very well done on giving us <i>just</i> enough info to get invested, but not <i>quite</i> enough to keep us from wondering—and that&#39;s not even getting into the question of what information Agamemnon was trying to get from Lilianna in the first place.<br><br>Lilianna is a cringe-inducing, negative character in just about every aspect imaginable.  You get it across in every tiny action and detail of her you give.  I do feel that the implied incestuous feelings are a bit too much, but I&#39;m glad you at least ended on a tiny shred of hope that Lilianna wants this situation to get better.<br><br>A couple of potential continuity errors: First, I assume this is taking place before DMSE&amp;R changed into DAS?  I want to ask, since you said Agamemnon is a TYH character, and wasn&#39;t sure if this scene is taking place in <i>our</i> past as well as his.<br><br>Second, the DAS/E&amp;R-that-was actually has white-painted walls and skylights, rather than looking darker than the rest of HQ.  This was seen in <a href="https://lily-winterwood.dreamwidth.org/4137.html">Lily Winterwood&#39;s spinoff</a>.  I do like the idea of medical classes being taught there, though.<br><br>—doctorlit probably wouldn&#39;t have known about the skylights off-hand, except that he wrote a scene in the main entrance foyer of the old DMSE&amp;R for his Thirty Hs mission</p>

            <p>On your points about continuity flubs:- <br><br>This is indeed taking place before DMSE&amp;R was merged into DAS. Agamemnon is sometime cameo-haver Algernon Wymbourne (of the DIA)&#39;s teenage son - when this story&#39;s set, he&#39;s somewhere between fourteen and seventeen, because I am extremely uncomfortable about sending people under the age of majority on missions in which they might die. The PPC is a fun and happy place, and child soldiery and the implications thereof are not a subject I wish to cover in a proper spinoff.<br><br>Lilianna is indeed a Mary-Sue, and one of the worst type; one who Just Doesn&#39;t Care about the setting she&#39;s violating. The point of her badfic was to do a love story between <s>the author&#39;s idealized self-insert</s> her and Jonathan Strange, of <i>&amp; Mr Norrell</i> fame. She treats her husband cruelly and barely thinks about her son because they were little more than set dressing except when they were obstacles to be overcome. In terms of PPC canon, Algie fell through one of the plot holes she created and (with a little help from the Guardsman) persuaded the DoI to pull everyone out, including all the manor&#39;s servants.<br><br>In many ways, Algie and Agamemnon are the polar opposites in terms of sentiment and style to Lilianna: stiff where she is informal, distant where she is approachable, that sort of thing. While these were traits assigned to them, it&#39;s continued into their tenure as PPC staffers. Algie is a good and principled man, who feels a duty of care to almost everyone he meets; Agamemnon is a dandy and a wit who uses manners and repartee to mask deep insecurities and unwarranted shame.<br><br>As to the decor of DMSE&amp;R... well, that&#39;s a straight-up screwup on my part, I&#39;m sorry to say. In my defence, I&#39;ve never read any of Lily Winterwood&#39;s stuff, but that&#39;s a pretty rubbish defence, particularly when the wiki is a thing. I should have checked, and I should have done better. Of course, places with clean white walls and skylights can still have deeply oppressive atmospheres; the decor can only do so much to hide the sawbones and the screams. Still, it was a mistake and one which I shall not make again. =]</p>

Not yet, anyway.))<br><br>&quot;Do you think you&#39;ll ever come back?&quot;<br><br>Dax took a moment to finish tying the fastenings on her rucksack, blinking back the tears. &quot;I hope so,&quot; she finally said, turning around. &quot;Maybe once I&#39;ve finally found someplace that would be safe for us to live.&quot;<br><br>Her father sighed and shook his head. &quot;It&#39;s a nice thought, but an impossible dream at best. Once a year, love, please?&quot;<br><br>Dax shrugged. &quot;I dunno. If I can get a job on a skyship like I&#39;m hoping, then that might not always be possible.&quot;<br><br>&quot;As often as you can manage, then,&quot; her mother (well, her other father, but also her mother—it was complicated) said, kissing her on the forehead. &quot;You know where to find us.&quot;<br><br>Dax nodded, throwing her arms around her mother. &quot;I&#39;m going to miss you,&quot; she sniffled, fighting back the lump in her throat.<br><br>Her father put his arms around the two of them and held them close. &quot;We&#39;re going to miss you, too,&quot; he said. &quot;But we knew this day would come, sooner or later. Even as a child, we knew you&#39;d rather leave than stay in the tribe.&quot;<br><br>Dax pulled back slightly, leaving just her hands resting on her parents&#39;. &quot;You&#39;re not going to ask me to stay?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Why would we?&quot; her mother said. &quot;Your life is much more important than whatever worry we might feel.&quot; She wrapped an arm around her mate&#39;s waist. &quot;And we know you&#39;re more than capable of looking out for yourself. So.&quot; She took Dax&#39;s face in her hands. &quot;Get out there and show the world what you&#39;re made of.&quot;<br><br>And there were the tears. Dax ducked her head, shoulders beginning to shake as they embraced once more. &quot;Love you guys,&quot; she choked out.<br><br>&quot;Love you too, sweetheart,&quot; her father murmured. He took a step back, wiping his eyes. &quot;Be safe out there.&quot;</p>

            <p>This is very simple, kind of like the basic setup of this type of scene.  It works, but I don&#39;t find myself getting very invested . . . which may just because I haven&#39;t been keeping up with the #Rudis logs, and don&#39;t really know of Dax, much.  At least having access to portals in HQ, Dax is ironically more able to visit than she would be from a skyship, despite being on a different world!<br><br>—doctorlit hates this type of goodbye in real life</p>

            <p>&quot;When will I see you again?&quot;<br><br>I stopped walking, just as I was about to go through the front door. I turned to face my former best friend, my former partner, my former lover.<br><br>&quot;I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll ever be able to bring myself to see you ever again.&quot;<br><br>I continued out the door, and onto the street. It&#39;d been a long five years. But being lied to, cheated on, stolen from, gossiped about, and every other horrible thing on that list, I had to leave. I just had to. No matter what I was to him, he is nothing to me now. I hailed a cab. I asked for the nearest airport, and I booked a flight somewhere faraway. I needed a vacation, and I had his credit card. There was enough money in my bank account to set me up nicely wherever I decided to land, and I had a large amount of training experience in the tech industry to land me a decent job, if not an excellent one. I thought about calling my mom. It&#39;s one of those things that you don&#39;t really think about, you know? Calling a parent and telling them that &quot;Hey, I just left New York and my husband and now I&#39;m starting a new life somewhere else.&quot; I figured people only did that in the movies, but no. I called her. I&#39;m sure we spent what must have been an hour talking, and another hour after that of me just bawling my eyes out. I&#39;m not proud of that, but I honestly did feel better afterwards. I&#39;m never going to see these people in this lobby ever again, so why care? My flight was booked to California. Apparently has good beaches and good booze. I&#39;ll be okay. I&#39;ll move on, I will drink till I forget, and drink till I forget that I drank to forget. And that&#39;s okay. I picked an aisle seat. And I&#39;m going to listen to my favorite music all the way there. And then I will live my own happy ending.</p>

            <p>Despite the short length, you get all the information we need into this.  You hit us right out with the moment of leaving, fill in the reasons soon after, and make us understand the emotions of the leaver.<br><br>I&#39;m not normally a fan of big block paragraphs, and this one does look especially jarring because of how much of the story it occupies.  However, it does work in this case, at least somewhat.  It kind of gives me the feeling that once the narrator got past That Moment, everything seemed to pick up speed for them.  Maybe that&#39;s because the emotions and tears are making things blurry and out of focus, or maybe because the narrator is finally powering up into the momentum they&#39;ve needed, and couldn&#39;t attain during the bad relationship.  Doesn&#39;t entirely matter, but it&#39;s a good feeling to get across to the reader, and I think you&#39;ve succeeded.<br><br>—doctorlit</p>

            <p>This was well-done!  There are so many little details that are different for Andalites and humans, but both of you guys always seem to keep them in mind so well when you&#39;re writing Ilraen and Farilan.  And both characters react to each other and to every little stimulus from the experience level they feel like they&#39;re at right now.  Just a very realistically done series of character interactions, all around.  I&#39;m also glad Farilan is going to have some emotional depth to her, rather than just being, um.

<li>I&#39;m liking how the opening two paragraphs characterize Ilraen and Farilan&#39;s attitudes towards each other<br>  - Or do they? That summary was oddly insistent<br>  - As is that next bit, where Farilan is concerned about the scar<br>- Ok, Ilraen needing to explain Christmas presents is cute<br>- Well, handing over the Monster Book of Monsters could&#39;ve gone worse<br>- &quot;If she&#39;d had eyebrows at that moment, she would have raised one.&quot; is good<br>- The thing with Ilraen cutting off the string of names was a nice touch<br>- That was a good discussion of clothes<br>- Farilan&#39;s got a point about the balance<br>- Minor wording nit: Is it &quot;the Cemetery Hill&quot; or just &quot;Cemetery Hill&quot;? I&#39;d&#39;ve used the latter.<br>- Ilraen has good taste in introductory food, and I&#39;m liking the vague nod to the fact that HQ probably has an economy of some sort<br>- &quot;Ilraen, did you take me out here to teach me, or to romance me?&quot;<br>   - Nice save, Ilraen. And, hey friends is good<br>- (on reread) &quot;doing her best to look dismissive&quot; is a good way to show what Farilan thinks about this<br>- Human stuff for Homeworld stuff is a good conversation thing<br>- (on reread) Y&#39;ll&#39;ve got a four-dot ellipsis after &quot;scoops&quot;. Unless that&#39;s meant to be &quot;... .&quot;, in which case you&#39;ve got extra spaces in your ellipsis.<br>- Museums of lost writing do sound like a thing Farilan would like<br>- IIRC, hands to the face were an intimate gesture for Andalites, so the vague hint of one ... Are you two ship-teasing?<br>- Hi, Monster Book of Monsters. Wasn&#39;t expecting to see you there at the end.<br>- <i>gets to Ix&#39;s author&#39;s note</i> They&#39;re going to start dating.

Crit. Aside from the minor typos in the list above, the only other bone I could see myself picking (and I&#39;m debating with myself about whether this is an issue) is that &quot;The time passed far too quickly. Soon Ilraen&#39;s two hours were almost up&quot; leaves &quot;and then for a while, more of what we just saw&quot; a bit implicit. I inferred that from context, but it maybe could&#39;ve used a few more words to specify. Maybe? It&#39;s nearing midnight, I&#39;m not sure.<br><br>- Tomash</li>

            <p>Because the last time I tried setting this up, everyone (including me) ended up being way too busy. ^^; Anyway, let&#39;s try this again and hope people have more time for it! I&#39;m going to set up the same rules as with my previous attempt, so if anyone wants in, just shoot me an e-mail!<br><br><b>ADMISSION AND SETUP:</b><br>1. You need to have Permission and at least two agents to enter this event. You don&#39;t have to have the teams participate in their entirety, either - any one of your agents can opt out based on whatever&#39;s most convenient for you.<br>2. All Boarders and agents will be going in basically blind - meaning that nobody will know who sent what until all the gifts have been opened! Hence, in order to enter, send me an e-mail (my address is clickable) with your attending agents and which gift each will bring. This may be either a &quot;souvenir&quot; from a mission you&#39;ve published previously, or just something they happen to have that they want to give away. As soon as you&#39;ve sent the e-mail, reply to this post with the word &quot;Sent&quot; and no message content, so everyone will know who&#39;s participating.<br>3. I will take six or seven other Boarders for this year&#39;s event, so the first seven Boarders to submit applications will be the ones attending.<br>4. Anyone with Permission can host this event. One of their agents must serve as an in-universe host for this event, but all agents are required to participate as players, including the host. I will confirm who the host will be if and when anyone steps forward - otherwise, Falchion will be the host this year. (My other participating agents will be my DIC and DMS-VG teams, but no other agents of mine will be participating, for some very spoilery reasons.)<br><br><b>EVENT RULES:</b><br>5. Once everything&#39;s been set up, preferably on New Year&#39;s Day, the Boarder volunteering the event host will set up an introductory post on the T-Board for this event. The most important rule: <b>NOBODY MUST KNOW WHAT THE GIFTS ARE UNTIL THEY&#39;VE OPENED THEM.</b> All of the gifts will be wrapped and put in a big pile at the start of the game.<br>6. Once I&#39;ve tallied the full list, I&#39;ll provide a list of the players, and a list of the gifts, but not a list of who sent what. The starting player will then be selected at random. Then when that player opens a gift, the agent who submitted it must speak up and confirm that they were the one who did so. Then that agent is the next to play! Thus, in general, the person who will play during each turn is the one who volunteered the gift revealed during the previous turn.<br>7. For each turn, the agent currently in play can either choose a gift from the pile (I&#39;ll provide the full list of gifts on the Posting Board) or, if others before them have already chosen gifts, they can &quot;steal&quot; a gift from the previous owner. A gift can be stolen up to twice; after that, it is locked to the agent it&#39;s ended up with, and cannot be stolen again. Note also that if a gift is stolen from any agent, THEY CANNOT STEAL IT BACK.<br>8. The game ends once everyone has received a gift. Since the first agent cannot steal, he/she will be given the choice to steal after everyone else has played.<br><br>And there you have it - hopefully this year we&#39;ll actually HAVE a Gift Exchange. Again, if anyone wishes to participate, just send me an e-mail with the agents planned to be involved and the gifts they&#39;ll be bringing. Good luck! :)</p>

            <p>I understand that there&#39;s been some recent drama that&#39;s been overshadowing this thread, but I&#39;m still interested in going through with the 2018 Gift Exchange (unlike last year, where everyone was just too darn busy :c), and I still need two or three more Boarders to have enough people to set it up. So, uh... Hello? Anybody?<br><br>For the sake of having this event at least start up in January, I&#39;ll give a one-week window for you guys to join in this event. Hopefully, if enough people do so, I should be able to set something up on Thursday or Friday, Wednesday evening at the earliest. Again, two or three more people shall suffice as long as they have Permission and at least one agent team.</p>

            <p>On a meta level, the host is the Boarder who agrees to organize the event, i.e. set up the introductory thread, keep track of who gets what, and enforce the rules of the Exchange as the players participate. The in-universe host can be any one of the agents that this Boarder chooses, and has a similar purpose albeit within the story of the event/thread itself.<br><br>It doesn&#39;t have to be me specifically, either, although I am, as always, the one compiling the lists of people and gifts. If any participating Boarder wants to step up and be the host, all they have to do is ask - especially since this year will probably be as busy for me as the last, and I could use a little help for events like this!

            <p>...but given work and family things I just haven&#39;t had the time to respond to it until now. Your folks are added to the list along with Hardric&#39;s, which leaves about two or three more Boarder slots, as noted above.<br><br>And to answer your question from PM, I&#39;d rather not describe the packaging in case it gives any of the gifts away - this is, after all, a blind-bag sort of thing.

            <p>Dearest PPC! Ladies, gentlemen, those who are yet to make up your mind and those who do not wish to do so!<br><br>I hate being the bearer of bad news. So before I say anything, I ask all of you to be calm and professional about this. Last thing we need on this last day of the year is another drama to divide us. Once again, I would like all of us to discuss and take appropriate measures in this case, and leave the matter with no negative future consequences.<br><br>I, Matt Cipher, would like to file a complaint about the behavior of another member, known as Nord Ronnoc. I am well-aware that a pit between the Board and Discord is vast and treacherous, but let us all gather here, to take care of our members.<br><br>Today, that is December 31st, 2017, at 1:24 PM (my time), Nord Ronnoc posted a message in the channel #generic_salt, used to vent mostly about video games and other media. He said as follows:<br><br><i>&quot;People always say &#39;OMG CARTOONS ARE DYING1!1&#39; or some other form.&quot;</i><br><br>During the course of discussion, it was revealed that this was his impression of another member - OpionedAngel - which was ultimately followed by a conclusion of mockery and accusations of stupidity. Without any sort of further comments from the defendant.<br><br>Additional comments and messages were delivered, asking Nord Ronnoc to explain his point of view, including one from Moderator Maslab, yet were only met with silence and blissful ignorance, as Nord later on continued participating in the regular chat discussions, pretending nothing has happened. <br><br>In absence of any testimony from the defendant, and being given a plenty of time to do so, I wish to make this case public and ask for a case and eventual solution of it. Mockery without explanation is not a major offence, but one that shouldn&#39;t be swept under a rug.<br><br>Additional Attachments and Evidence:<br><br><a href="https://imgur.com/DL201wN"><a href="https://imgur.com/DL201wN">https://imgur.com/DL201wN</a></a><br><br>Exhibit A: Initial discussion, Iximaz&#39;s plea for explanation.<br>Exhibit B: Nord&#39;s appearance and ignoring the issue despite further pleads.<br>Exhibit C: Matt Cipher&#39;s personal message to Nord, advising him to explain himself. Ignored.<br><br>As of this moment, 10:51 PM (my time), not one response was made from Nord. <br><br>Thank you for your attention.</p>

            <p>Must&#39;ve gotten lost in the Board&#39;s formatting and thought that there were way more people here than there are, haha! Whoops! <br><br>And the fracturing also does make sense. I kind of want to take a look at those, just out of curiosity/my &quot;what if there&#39;s something funny (long rant about the original PPC, rules that don&#39;t make sense/are exactly the same except for one thing, uncreative name that has to do with ours, etc.)?&quot; instinct. Evidently if they were all started by drama and failed, they could have these things, because from my deduction, I can guess that the general idea behind them was &quot;the PPC except not the PPC,&quot; and there was no real change to any fundamental concept, making it have no chance against us for people looking to join something like this. I guess.<br><br>As for your question about larger organizations, this is what I think I have so far: when there&#39;s a <i>huge</i> amount of people and no one real &quot;this is how things are done&quot;, a small conflict between a few people can escalate beyond control or compromise, and basically create a bunch of warring factions, some of which may go off on their own and start a different organization. Basically, using internet terms, flame war + no moderator to define the rules and ban those who don&#39;t follow them = possibility of fractures. I think. It probably has more nuance than that (I mean, we have our Constitution, so there is some degree of &quot;how it&#39;s done&quot; here), but this is what I&#39;ve figured out so far. (Technically I learned this from a how-to on writing fictitious organizations, but the logic behind it makes sense in the real world. I can send you the link if you wish.)<br><br>-Twistey</p>

            <p>The difference being that democracy = the people make the rules, and anarchy = no one makes rules.<br><br>As you noted, we do have a &quot;how things are done&quot; in our Constitution, and our lack of mods on the Board just means that it&#39;s <i>everyone&#39;s</i> responsibility to make sure those standards are upheld.

            <p>I have a couple of questions.<br><br>1. Did this need to be brought up here? Shouldn&#39;t this have been dealt with by the mods? It seems Maslab was aware of the situation and presumably prepared to do something about it, right? OpinionedAngel didn&#39;t even know anyone had a beef with them. Unless there&#39;s a bigger problem than this one incident that&#39;s been going unresolved for some reason...?<br><br>2. Since it HAS been brought up here, I&#39;d like to know if Nord Ronnoc assured anyone who was concerned earlier, or a mod, or anyone besides Ozzielot, that it won&#39;t happen again. Also, was there ever any clarification on what he meant? And what about an actual apology, for apparently ignoring people&#39;s requests for clarification even if the rest was a misunderstanding?<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>... then it actually looks pretty bad. Taken at face value, that&#39;s a direct flame of another PPCer, <i>not</i> provoked by similar behaviour on their end, and a refusal to apologise there-for. It suggests Nord Ronnoc believes that mocking other PPCers is acceptable - when in fact, a PPCer shouldn&#39;t be flaming <i>any</i> real people, PPCer or not.<br><br>Given that Nord Ronnoc&#39;s name came up in the Conciliatory back in May, it may be worth someone who&#39;s able to cope with looking at that thread <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=308113;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">reading through it</a> to find out whether this <i>is</i> part of a pattern, or just a one-off.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>My sense is indeed that this isn&#39;t the first time Nord&#39;s name has come up in instances of misconduct toward others. However, my memory isn&#39;t accurate enough to say exactly when or under what circumstances, or if those incidents were ever resolved.<br><br>I did look at that bit of the Conciliatory, though, and it looks like Herr is the only one who offered any kind of apology for any of it (specifically, revealing private information). Nord flat-out refused. The resolution there was that they both agreed to have nothing more to do with each other. That was a pretty extreme deal where neither side was blameless, though, which doesn&#39;t seem directly connected to this current discussion.<br><br>If anyone knows anything I don&#39;t, I encourage them to please speak up.<br><br>For now, my feeling is that an apology from Nord is required, for the insult to OpinionedAngel (since he hasn&#39;t denied it) and for ignoring multiple attempts to clarify the issue, and if it is not delivered, then the Discord mods should take whatever action they feel is appropriate to censure the behavior.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>was Nord ignoring his issues and pretending nothing happened, as he did in his previous offense.

            <p>For a few reasons:<br><br>a) Nord blatantly ignored anything about the issue, despite being individually asked for it four separate times.<br><br>b) He only reacted with a vauge &quot;won&#39;t happen again&quot; after I posted this on Board.<br><br>c) I would like to avoid another issue of &quot;Discord handles their own matters, and turns out the Board knows nothing&quot;, if we happen to drop into a major drama. Even if the offense at this time wasn&#39;t a big drama. Call me paranoid, but I thought at the moment this was the right thing. I won&#39;t bring up every smallest dispute to the Board, but let this be a sort of example to why we should make these cases public.<br><br>Also, about Nord assurance, this is all that happened: <a href="https://i.imgur.com/1TLOs8I.png"><a href="https://i.imgur.com/1TLOs8I.png">https://i.imgur.com/1TLOs8I.png</a></a></p>
