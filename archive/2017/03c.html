Oh, right, it was the election last night. Did we manage to win a seat? Who won, anyway?<br><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/Overview.jpg"><br><br>... whaddaya mean I&#39;m Prime Minister now?<br><br><hr>
<br><br>So this is Democracy 3. For the real oldbies among us, it&#39;s a lot like NationStates, but decisions actually mean something. We&#39;ve just been elected to rule an entire country, and that big sprawling mess up above is it. White circles are our policies, anything from taxes to legal drinking age to creationism:evolution balance. Blue circles are stats about our society, such as poverty, literacy, car usage and so on. And red... well, red is bad things. We&#39;ve got alcohol abuse, we&#39;re a technological backwater... yeah, things aren&#39;t looking good.<br><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/Monies.jpg"><br><br>And that&#39;s <i>how</i> not-good they are. Our GDP is at baseline, our income is way below our expenditures... and we&#39;ve just been elected to deal with this fiasco.<br><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/Polls.jpg"><br><br>Though I&#39;m not sure <i>how</i> we got elected. We&#39;re polling spectacularly badly - perhaps only one person turned up to vote? I bet it was one of you, wasn&#39;t it? Rascals.<br><br>Well, there&#39;s no help for it: we&#39;re going to have to run this country. We&#39;ll need to adjust our policies - they all run on sliders, which have a cost to adjust, so we can&#39;t just change everything at once - to try and <s>hold on to power</s> improve our country. Well... by &#39;we&#39;, I mostly mean &#39;me&#39;.<br><br>But you, dear Boarders, are my appointed ministers. Yeah, I&#39;ve got an in-game cabinet, but they&#39;re a waste of space. So if we&#39;re going to do this, I need <i>your</i> advice. I will play through a year at a time (four turns to the year, and elections take place every four years), and together we can try to get re-elected, while avoiding assassination.<br><br>Oh, did I mention the assassinations? Yup, that&#39;s in there.<br><br>Here&#39;s what I need from my trusty ministers:<br><br>1/ Our citizens are from a wide variety of backgrounds. The coloured bars here show how much each group likes us, while the grey background shows how prominent they are:<br><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/Demographics.jpg"><br><br>You, dear ministers, need to tell me <b>which demographic(s) you want me to focus on pleasing</b>. I&#39;ll then look for policies that will make those groups happier - for instance, parents support child benefits, but are against legalising drugs.<br><br>2/ The policies are split into seven sections (look back at the overview higher up): Transport, Foreign Policy, Welfare, Economy, Taxes, Public Services, Law &amp; Order. Please tell me <b>which section I should focus on</b> this year. I&#39;ll probably have to also adjust things outside that section, but I want a priority.<br><br>3/ We&#39;re not just limited to the policies we&#39;ve inherited from our predecessors (whoever they might be): we can also enact new policies!<br><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/Policies.jpg"><br><br>These are the options our cabinet have presented to us. If you want me to try and implement one of these, tell me and I&#39;ll do my best to scrape the political capital together.<br><br>4/ It is essential that you give yourself a title. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/May_ministry">As Wikipedia shows</a>, ministerial positions in the UK range from &#39;Minister of State for Employment&#39; to the delightfully-named &#39;Minister for the Northern Powerhouse&#39;. I&#39;m pretty sure you can craft yourselves some interesting titles... go nuts ^_^<br><br>Now, let&#39;s crack on! This country isn&#39;t going to run itself, except possibly into the ground. As soon as I get the advice of a couple of ministers, I&#39;m going to plough on and try to make our nation prosper! Or suffer. Or just implode. Up to you!<br><br><hr>
<br><br>For those who have played Democracy 3 before, we&#39;re playing as the UK (probably obviously). For those who haven&#39;t, but are interested, it&#39;s currently 75% off on Steam. For those who want to get away from the West, there is also a Democracy 3: Africa standalone expansion, so you can go wreck Ghana instead of Germany.<br><br>Now, come on, folks: let&#39;s go <s>ruin</s> run a nation!<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>...a vigilante.<br><br>Crime through the roof? Unemployment rising? Poverty going up?<br><br>If you&#39;re not careful, you&#39;ll start seeing vigilantes spring up, and where one vigilante rises, five more soon follow. And then you&#39;ve got a mess with them starting to be labeled superheros, or at least working unofficially with the police...and, well. You can&#39;t have that.<br><br>My suggestion as Super-Analyst? Cut police funding. Encourage super-villains--better yet, encourage *smart* super-villains. Import them from other places, if need be--increase immigration but don&#39;t increase funding to support immigrants. And raise the cost of living. As conditions turn harder, comic books suggest that super-villains will rise. (Varieties include the &quot;I will make my city better and squash all vigilantes trying to stop me&quot;--you may eventually be assassinated by one of them, of course, but that seems to be your goal, no? It can&#39;t hurt!)<br><br>As for the squatters...if you wish to increase super-villainy rates (do you? Of course you do!) my super-analysis is that evicting the squatters will provide more angry people to become super-villains&#39; minions! Wins all around. Well, sort of. The super-villains win, I guess.<br><br>((hopefully it&#39;s okay to join the advice giving two years in?

            <p>If you&#39;re going for the socialists, cut all government spending that increases employment. The more people can&#39;t find work, the angrier those socialists will get. Of note are state schools. If they&#39;re receiving anything but the bare minimum, they haven&#39;t been cut enough. Also cut legal and foreign aid, which will irritate the socialists, but won&#39;t make the Capitalists happy. If you want to irritate the Capitalists, increase all the taxes, not just the income tax, and increase limited automated trade, then state pensions, and then child benefits, in that order. Those all have people who benefit from them, unfortunately, but we can&#39;t offend everybody.</p>

            <p>Well, folks, I was always taught to lead with the bad news, and in this case, it&#39;s pretty bad. Our economy is... not an economy, as such. It&#39;s more of a black hole.<br><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/Economy.jpg"><br><br>It&#39;s been a rough year. Our credit rating has been downgraded, which I&#39;m afraid means more interest on our debt.<br><br>And... there&#39;s no easy way to put this, but halfway through the year, a General Strike was announced. The strikers - Socialists and Trade Unionists - placed the blame on high unemployment levels.<br><br>But don&#39;t let that get you down! We&#39;re only a year in, and any attempt to bring about true change will have a temporary impact.<br><br>And we <i>have</i> made a change, trusty ministers. At the combined urging of Non-Propaganda Communications, Silly Hats, and Ice Cream Affairs, we&#39;ve focussed on the environment of our beloved nation; at Surprisingly Important Things&#39; suggestion, we&#39;ve done so primarily through the Transport sector, building bus lanes and subsidising the railways (with some clean energy subsidies thrown in for good measure). And we have had an effect!<br><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/Enviro.jpg"><br><br>It&#39;s a small effect, but this is early days. We&#39;re not up for election for another three years, we have time to do this right.<br><br>On Technological Advancement&#39;s advice, we&#39;ve raised science funding, implemented technology grants, and then raised them later in the year. And it&#39;s paying off, folks, it&#39;s paying off:<br><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/Tech.jpg"><br><br>We&#39;ve followed Non-Propaganda Communications&#39; lead in taxes, raising Capital Gains and Inheritance taxes. We&#39;ve also implemented a strong program of funding the arts, and provided winter fuel allowances - gotta take care of the elderly!<br><br>So there have been changes. And I think a lot of them have been good changes:<br><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/Changes.jpg"><br><br>And, I gotta say, the poll results have been heartening.<br><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/Polls_1.jpg"><br><br>We&#39;re not exactly popular yet... but we will be!<br><br>So now we need to set our priorities for the coming year. Should we stay the course on our environmentalist-technologist path? Who should we tax (everyone, obviously, but how should we split it?)? What demographics do we want on side, and who can we ignore? (The so-called cabinet are offering pretty much the same new policies as before, minus the ones we implemented!)<br><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/Overview_1.jpg"><br><br>And one more question... I&#39;ve had a bunch of lobbyists pestering me about some sort of debt collection thing. Wanna give me your opinions on that? I could use the help.<br><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/Event.jpg"><br><br>((More ministers are always welcome!))<br><br>Prime Minister Huinesoron</p>

We haven&#39;t left business out, though - we&#39;ve subsidised small business, trying to diversify our economy.<br><br>And we&#39;ve shown improvement, we really have. Take a look at this!<br><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/Money.jpg"><br><br>I mean... not <i>much</i> improvement, granted. But our income has increased! Though, uh, our credit rating is now CC. So, y&#39;know, two steps forward, one step back. And at least we&#39;ve nearly put an end to the general strike!<br><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/Strike.jpg"><br><br>Our past policies are still paying fruit, too: check out the environment in our enlightened nation!<br><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/Enviro_1.jpg"><br><br>Funny story for you - middle of the year, we had a bona fide real-life superhero show up. Apparently we&#39;ve got some crime issues? Don&#39;t know if you folks want to do anything about that, I don&#39;t understand it myself.<br><br>Know what I do understand, though? Questions! And I&#39;ve got a neat one for you:<br><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/BankBonuses.jpg"><br><br>I&#39;ll leave you to consider that.

            <p>Prime Minister,<br><br>Let us not mince words. We are on the verge of a major economic crisis. My analysts (the ones who are either not fleeing the country with all of their money or currently standing on a ledge outside the building) have predicted a 79 percent chance that the country will default on its loans over the next year. We must find a way to reinvigorate our GDP without further spending ourselves into debt. My suggestions will not be popular, but we have some popularity to spare.<br><br>1) Make cuts to several of our largest programs, those being social programs and the military. I&#39;m not suggesting to gut them, but we have to tighten our belts a little bit.<br><br>2) Fractionally lower the capital gains tax and corporate tax rates. Businesses are not investing, and we&#39;re going to need to give them some incentives to do so again.<br><br>3) Consider making hard drugs illegal again, or at the very least restricted. I know that flip-flopping is seen as a major political sin, but so far the negatives for this policy are outweighing the potential positives. We&#39;ve lost the support of parents and damaged our nation&#39;s health, and for what? Some support from the liberals and about 1.5 billion in revenue?<br><br>Yours sincerely,<br>PoorCynic, MoDS</p>

            <p>... I think we need either an alcohol tax, or a tobacco tax. We can&#39;t allow our popularity to be shaken too much, and those are unpopular measures, so, even though we need the money, both is out of the question. However, an increase in one or another tax might be a good idea. I am afraid I believe we must also cut spending in some areas. They cannot be ones that we have focused on improving, nor can they be ones that reduce the value of the situations we are currently dealing with, however, so it must be selected carefully. It also should be an unpopular measure, as I believe reducing it will increase our popularity, however, that is, in my opinion, the least of our worries.</p>

            <p>Prime Minister,<br><br>It appears that the economy, both at home and across the entire globe, is <i>in latrina</i>. Given the direness of the situation, it may be time to make some harsh cuts to existing programs so as to bolster our GDP. We might possibly pass tax breaks for foreign investors? It is also for this reason that I argue we should not restrict banking bonuses. While this may strike some as odious, we must provide at least some corporate-centric incentives. <br><br>There are also multiple issues with crime and criminality in our fair nation. Organized crime, uncontrolled public drunkenness, lynch mobs—the entire situation is a dire one. Once again, I encourage us to—at the very least—increase the alcohol tax. Possibly even the drinking age. Eliminating the alcohol problem may also help alleviate some of our economic issues. It may not be popular, but neither is all the vomit in the gutters.<br><br>Yours respectfully,<br>PoorCynic, MoDS</p>

            <p>We can either increase old taxes and create new ones, then invest in ending homelessness or some other crisis, or we can cut spending. This depends primarily on how invested we are in keeping the Capitalists from wanting our heads. It&#39;s hard enough to effectively get rid of some of the crises in America, where there are a few outlets that can be used to relax the pressure from the Capitalist voters wanting you not just out of office, but dead. In the UK, it&#39;s far more difficult. Push taxes up too much, and they will try to assassinate you. Repeatedly. Until it works. And the one thing that makes Capitalists more infuriating to deal with than anybody else is that they hate basically every form of tax. So, basically, if we increase our income, we make the Capitalists want to kill us. So, if we do increase said income, it must be only as much as needed to focus on and eliminate one crisis. After one is eliminated, we can back off on those levels enough to give us funding for other areas, but not so much that we start the crisis all over again. However, should we do this, I&#39;m not sure we should focus on Homelessness. It seems like we should focus our efforts on a crisis that, either by removing it or because these groups like the reforms that would remove the crisis, will win us the support of the Poor, the Liberals, and the Self-Employed, seeing as these are all groups that are neutral to us. We could also attempt to cultivate Farmers and Religious voters.</p>

            <p>On the economy, well, I&#39;m not quite sure how to deal with it. I&#39;ll consider it, and if anything occurs to me, I&#39;ll mention it. I vote we should limit the power of debt collection agencies. I think it will get the poor, who may already be tempted to come to our party, to throw themselves behind our cause. It will also give us that warm, glowy feeling that comes from being decent people. Also, on the unemployment levels, I believe that increasing state schooling decreases those levels, so we might consider investing in that. We may also consider courting the socialist and liberal votes to increase our popularity, given that they seem to have a lot of influence.</p>

            <p>I strongly urge you to limit the activities of debt collection agencies. Letting them be is simply not an option; they are a blight on the good name of our nation and their activities must be strictly regulated.<br><br>I also believe that the stimulation of small businesses will lead to long-term growth in a variety of economic sectors, thus benefiting the poorer in our society, allowing them to become profitable and provide vital services. Not only that, but the growth generated will be able to fuel our economy, allowing for further revenue streams and the improvement of our economy back to AAA standard. Possibly.

            <p>In real life, the elderly always vote in absolute droves, so a Winter Fuel Allowance might be a good idea. However, we do need to balance the books.

Additionally, it might be a good idea to get some Micro-Generation Grants going in a limited capacity - again, this is something that&#39;ll get the greenies on side, of which we appear to have several.

            <p>I&#39;m leaving.<br>The way the community treated July is appalling. This is supposedly a place that has space for all sorts of different people. People on psychiatric medication? Easy. People who keep mouthing off in uncontrollable rage every time someone farts in their direction? Can do. Manipulative bastards? Easy. But it couldn&#39;t handle one person with a sharp tongue. That was too much for people here. So July became a scapegoat, and it became OK to treat her like crap, and now it looks like nobody thinks her being doxxed as well as being harassed to the point of leaving with her nose to the ground and her tail between her legs is something that&#39;s worthy of condemnation or of strong action. This community can&#39;t even give justice to someone who&#39;s been wronged by most people in it, and it&#39;s disgusting how flaccid the community&#39;s response is.<br>I am not removing anything from continuity; I&#39;m giving Zingenmir custody of my characters, and I trust her to retire them in a befitting manner. I don&#39;t want anyone else to use anything I created, or reference my stories and characters.<br>I&#39;m also giving Zingenmir my PG hat, should she want it.<br>I&#39;d like to use this post to say that I regret not understanding what was going on sooner; if I would&#39;ve, I could&#39;ve stopped it in its tracks by deleting Tomash&#39;s post and kicking people out of the server till their heads cooled.<br>I hope that everybody that was involved in the witch hunt would suffer as much as July did because of them, so that they might understand the immorality of their deeds; I hope that this misdeed will haunt them forevermore.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m sorry to see you go. I&#39;ll miss you grumping into the chat to grumble about philosophy and Japanese.<br><br>That said, though, I have to ask, what more would you have us do that we aren&#39;t already doing? I know what happened to JulyFlame was horrible, at least as much as I can know without being directly involved, but the PPC is essentially a direct democracy. The only real response we have to things like this is community consensus. Given that almost all of us probably have different ideas on what &quot;strong action&quot; is and when and how to apply it, and with the waters further muddied by even July saying Tomash doesn&#39;t need to be banned (not saying that&#39;s the only issue, just the most prominent one) how can we move any faster or more strongly than we already are?<br><br>I don&#39;t mean to sound accusatory or put you on the spot to try to fix the community&#39;s problems, I just want to understand. If there really is something wrong with the way we do things that&#39;s driven two respected members of the community away, I&#39;d like to at least get some idea of what it is. I haven&#39;t seen it in six years here, so if there&#39;s something to see I&#39;m not likely to see it on my own, and with July gone and you leaving, this is basically my last chance to ask about it.<br><br>Whether you choose to respond or not, or even read this post, I hope you do well wherever you wind up in life.<br>Good luck.</p>

            <p>I don&#39;t want to see friends leave the PPC. I don&#39;t want to see <i>anyone</i> leave. It hurts. We&#39;re all very emotional right now, reacting more strongly than we would otherwise, and I just want it to stop.<br><br>But it&#39;s clear that there are deep, gaping wounds in this community. That people from across the Board and Discord have serious issues with others, and with the community as a whole. Some of them have come to light in the last week; I&#39;m sure others are still simmering away below the surface.<br><br>So I&#39;d like to make a proposal that in <b>one month</b> - ie, around April 20th, or in the week after Easter - we sit down and calmly go through every single thing that&#39;s hanging unseen over our heads.<br><br>To do this, I&#39;m going to make an extraordinary request: I want you to tell me what unresolved or outstanding issues <i>you</i> think the PPC community has. Whether they&#39;re between two people or one person and a group; whether they&#39;re a single incident or a low-level pattern of behaviour; whether they&#39;re a failure of the community as a whole or a private dispute.<br><br><b>Please do not</b> tell me here. Email me at <u><a href="mailto:huinesoron@hotmail.com">huinesoron@hotmail.com</a></u>. Outline what happened - who was involved, what they did, how people reacted. If an incident happened on the Board, please link to it (the archives are <a href="https://technodann.github.io/PPC-board-2.0/archive/index.html"></a>here). If it happened in the Discord chat, please give a date; I&#39;ll chase someone up to get the transcripts later. If it happened by personal communication, please <b>do not</b> send me files: a summary will be much better, and I won&#39;t have any more accidental doxxing even by email.<br><br>I will go through everything I&#39;m sent, and try to put together an impartial summary of each incident. Then, in a month - or later if we have more issues between then and now, I want this to happen when we&#39;re <i>calm</i> - I will put it all up for consideration. (If the incident involved <i>me</i>, you are still free to send it to me, and I will do my best to remain impartial in my summary. But if you prefer, you can hold it back and present it yourself.)<br><br>Before you ask: yes, this is going to be fething miserable for me. No, I don&#39;t expect it to magically fix everything. Yes, you might share an issue and find the community disagrees with you. But yes, I genuinely believe that if we can pull these hidden problems out into the light, look at them together, and decide what censures, reprimands, and even bans the community feels are appropriate, that we can finally put the majority of them to rest.<br><br>I am not setting myself up as a moderator. I am not setting myself up as a mediator. I will get everything together and start the discussion, but I will have exactly as much say in the outcomes as anyone else. This is a community matter, and it will be resolved by the community.<br><br>hS<br><br>PS: &#39;I think we need moderators but everyone keeps saying no&#39; does not count as an unresolved issue. There is a vote <i>right now</i> which is 2:1 against Board moderators; the fact that you don&#39;t <i>like</i> the explicit community consensus doesn&#39;t mean it doesn&#39;t exist. ~hS, pre-empting that one</p>

            <p>I suspect people are busy composing (or at least preparing in their heads) the emails describing all the stuff they want brought up in the planned thread.<br><br>However, I&#39;d like to suggest that, if you&#39;re sending an email, you write it in a Word document or something, read it over a few times, and <i>don&#39;t</i> send it right away. Instead, save the text and put it aside for a few days. Then, open up the draft email and read it again. Make sure you still think all the problems you mentioned are problems (and add any new observations you&#39;ve had), then either send it or give it a few more days to simmer before a third reading and a send. I&#39;m suggesting this because, as hS said, emotions are running high right now, and it&#39;s probably best to not let them run rampant over the inputs to the discussion being planned.</p>

            <p>Write it down, certainly, so that you have it, but then do look it over and let it sit for a bit and come back to it a few times. It means you&#39;re unlikely to end up forgetting a handful of things you would&#39;ve liked to include, you&#39;ll catch any clarity issues, and you&#39;ll have time to think through exactly what you want to say and how you want to say it. Not that you can&#39;t always send a follow-up with more information, but it&#39;s always nice to have as much as possible in one email rather than spread out over a lengthening email chain.<br><br>(Like Tomash, I&#39;m just suggesting--but I do think it&#39;s a good idea! Especially since we&#39;re still in the middle--but hopefully now nearing the end--of a pretty strongly emotional time right now.)<br><br>~Zing, who is still pretty busy but seems to be weighing in on things today</p>

The emphasis here is on speed rather than perfection - get it beta&#39;d if you want, but it&#39;s not essential, because:<br>-If you post a story, you should also provide constructive criticism for another story in the thread. Your concrit should <i>not</i> focus on SPaG errors (though you can point at them, too), but on issues of character, plot, realism, setting, and the like. And it should be constructive! Suggest improvements, don&#39;t just point out what&#39;s bad.<br>-If (when!) you receive concrit, you should rework your story based on it. This isn&#39;t essential, but is highly recommended.<br><br>Got that? I hope so! Now for the prompt.<br><br>We&#39;re all pretty dang miserable these days, what with one thing and another and a million more. But none of us want to be (right?).

            <p>The nurse&#39;s verdict was that Agent Katcha had broken her hip. Not to mention, she was nearly hypothermic. With only one Bad Slash team working the Grishaverse, she&#39;d been sent places no elderly Vulcan should have been able to survive. She&#39;d been caught in a snowstorm at the Ice Court courtyard, running from a troop of heavily-armed bit character <i>druskelle</i> soldiers. Her partner, Agent Kiber, hadn&#39;t been able to stop her from losing her footing on the ice bridge and slipping, sliding, and landing at an awful angle. They&#39;d abandoned the mission half-completed: Kiber wrapped eir feelers around her and tugged her through a portal straight to Medical. <br><br>Now eir partner was immobilized in a contraption of ropes, IV tubes, and heating pads. Lights flashed steadily and gizmos beeped. Her hair had wormed its way out of her meticulous braids and fell haphazardly around her face. Her eyes were closed. Kiber stared hard at the system of plates and pads around her chest, noting with desperate relief each tiny rise and fall. The nurse put her hand on Kiber&#39;s sailfin.<br><br>&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; she said.<br><br>&quot;She&#39;s fine,&quot; Kiber replied. &quot;She&#39;ll recover. And we&#39;ll finish that mission. Tell the. . . tell whatever stupid Flower we&#39;re supposed to answer to that we&#39;ll be done before ey knows it! Right, Kattie?&quot;<br><br>The beeping gizmo beeped again. The nurse awkwardly rubbed eir fin and wondered if she needed to call in FicPsych, or a nurse better trained in bedside manner.<br><br>Katcha&#39;s brow wrinkled, and her eyes snapped open. &quot;Kiber, I hadn&#39;t thought your species was deficient in memory. I specifically asked that you not use that nickname for me.&quot;<br><br>Kiber shrugged the nurse&#39;s hand off and bared eir teeth in the Venusian equivalent of a grin: &quot;If I stop, will you finish the mission with me?&quot;<br><br>Katcha raised her eyebrows. &quot;Of course I will. As I was saying, your list was missing a vital charge for throwing Wylan out of character. I understand that his personality doesn&#39;t interest you, but that&#39;s no excuse for. . .&quot;<br><br>As she prattled on, Kiber gave the nurse who hovered with a worried look an eyeless tentacle-glare, and she slunk off.<br><br>((A/N: Hope you guys enjoyed this! I don&#39;t think the fic they were missioning exists, but I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if it did. The title is a saying from the continuum the mission was set in, <i>Six of Crows</i>. It&#39;s a farewell that means something like &quot;good luck&quot; or &quot;I believe in you.&quot; I might use this as the beginning for a Permission prompt one day, since I took my inspiration from a random prompt I rolled (one agent breaks the other out of Medical). Feedback is of course appreciated!))</p>

            <p>Alone in his RC, he stared down at the wand in his hand.<br><br>This was legitimate—well, as legitimate as a Suvian wand from a badfic could be.  It was undoubtedly made from some outlandish non-canon things, bear claw and eucalyptus wood or such, but a real and proper wand, nonetheless.  Not one of those Muggle-use wands that any agent could use.<br><br>He tried one last time.  <i>Swish and flick.</i>  Nothing.  Nothing at all.<br><br>He looked down at the Kwikspell lesson laying open on the large tabletop before him.  The diagrams on wand posturing and foot stance.  The basic spells that a child in the Potterverse could manage—at least, the ones who were wizards.<br><br>He batted the Kwikspell course off the table, releasing the wand at the end of the motion so that it clattered to the ground along with the paper.  It joined the growing pile of magic swords, enchanted armor, cursed gems.  Trinkets and baubles and refuse from across the known multiverse, all supposed to grant magical powers in their origin worlds.<br><br>And, to him, all useless.<br><br>He should have known, really.  Kwikspell didn’t work for Muggles, and that is, essentially, what he was.  Never mind that the line in the fanfiction from which he’d been recruited specifically named his as “wizard.”<br><br>But nothing seemed to work.  Nothing in this entire, wide multiverse—no, that just couldn’t be.<br><br>He moved around the table, to the spot where he had laid out the five basic land cards of <i>Magic: the Gathering</i>.  Plains, Island, Swamp, Mountain, Forest, corresponding to white, blue, black, red and green mana.  In his home universe, wizards and planeswalkers fueled their spells with mana, drawn from memories of the lands they had visited in their travels and training.  In the card game, the players represented this energy source, and the cost of using it, by turning the land cards ninety degrees for the rest of the turn: “tapping.”<br><br>Imagine if all worlds contained mana.  A PPC agent, gaining memories of them all . . . tapping all those resources . . .<br><br>He ran his long, thin fingers over his face.  He certainly <i>looked</i> the part of a stereotypical wizard.  Robes, wrinkled skin, pointy hat, long, grey beard and mustache.  The PPC at large clearly thought so—his nickname of “Pinball Wizard” had developed from his activities in the Game Center, though the others didn’t realize how mocked he felt to be called that.<br><br>But someday, it would be a true description.  He would keep searching.  He would keep trying the magic items he could find on missions.  He would keep bartering for what he could get off HQ’s black market.  He would, someday, live up to his nickname.<br><br>The Pinball Wizard lightly rested his fingertips on one of the land cards and turned it sideways.<br><br><b>doctorlit’s note:</b> I have written this character once before, for PoorCynic’s <a href="https://technodann.github.io/PPC-board-2.0/archive/2013/10b.html#post-112061">very first</a> Writing Workshop.  I know I haven’t used him since then, but I do plan for him to be part of my regular cast of characters.  <i>Magic: the Gathering</i>, mana and land cards were created by Richard Garfield and belong to Wizards of the Coast, while Muggles, Kwikspell and the Potterverse were created by and belong to J.K. Rowling.  Muggle-use wands were created by Meir Brin.</p>

            <p><i>Young Wizards</i>, Diane Duane&#39;s 10.5 book Young Adult series about... well, the clue is in the title. Extremely bookish wizards in a modern-day setting, who will quite regularly travel by magic into space. It&#39;s a glorious mix of magical fantasy and scifi.<br><br>Reciting the Oath I quoted is the start of a wizard&#39;s journey. Read it out*, and you&#39;ll be given access to magic - but under conditions, of course. This is fiction, after all. ^<em>~<br><br>*In-universe you&#39;ll only come across a copy of the Oath if the Powers think you have the potential. Whether it would work for someone who, say, brought a copy of one of the books into the universe is an unanswered question, though borrowing someone else&#39;s Manual did work once...<br><br>It&#39;s a fun series about magic, sacrifice, responsibility, and bending the rules of the universe by talking at it really convincingly. ^</em>^ They&#39;re very enjoyable, surprisingly deep, and written by someone who&#39;s not dead yet so there&#39;s at least a chance of getting another one out of her.<br><br><i>In Life&#39;s name and for Life&#39;s sake, I assert that I will employ the Art which it Its gift in Life&#39;s service alone, rejecting all other usages. I will guard growth and ease pain. I will fight to preserve what grows and lives well in its own way; I will not change any creature unless its growth and life, or that of the system of which it is part, are threatened or threaten another.<br><br>To these ends, in the practice of my Art, I will ever put aside fear for courage, and death for life, when it is right to do so - looking always towards the Heart of Time, where all our sundered times are one, and all our myriad worlds lie whole in the One from whom they proceeded...</i><br><br>~The Wizard&#39;s Oath, <i>A Wizard Abroad</i>, in my personal preferred version<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>it&#39;s impossible to read the latest version in physical book form. ^_^ The timeline for the <i>Young Wizards</i> books is famously messed up (well, y&#39;know, famously if you read them), with computing technology jumping from &#39;80s Apples to iPods in what, internally, should be a couple of years.<br><br>So before the release of the most recent book, Diane sat down and did a comprehensive reworking of the early books to synch things up (and fix a few other problems along the way). The New Millenium Editions are available as e-books... but not as printed ones. Which is annoying if you care about continuity, but the stories themselves don&#39;t change, and are still cool.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>This is a drabble, <i>exactly</i> 100 words.<br><br>***<br><br>The first thought that Arden had when stumbling into the PPC for the first time was that everybody looked so happy. It was just the time of night at Rudi’s when everyone was laughing and talking loudly. Of course, after that came the overwhelming realization that he was not on his world, and that everything he’d known was unfathomable distances away. There had been one moment though, where the thought had flashed through his mind that there was something beyond the constant wars. Something beyond blood and tears. <br><br>Afterward, he realized that this something was the reason he stayed.<br><br>Hope.<br><br>***<br><br>I hope (sorry, I had to) that you enjoyed this drabble as much as I enjoyed the other stories on this thread. I don&#39;t have any concrit for the other fics, other than that some of them were confusing to me, but I assume that has to do with the fact that I don&#39;t know any of these characters; not that they were badly written. </p>

            <p>I approve of drabbles. ^_^ You&#39;ve taken a decent stab at the concept - getting each idea across in a handful of words, setting the scene early and letting it flow from there.<br><br>I think the one suggestion I would make would be to make the realisation/hope thing be about the <i>PPC</i>, not about... I&#39;m guessing Arden comes from somewhere with lots of war? At the moment, your message is &#39;the PPC is better than home&#39;. I feel like a better message might be &#39;the PPC is a sucky job, but there are moments when it&#39;s the best thing in the worlds&#39;.<br><br>I really do like the idea that his first experience in HQ was laughter.

            <p>Note: <b>SPOILER</b> warning for the end and, to some extent, general premise of <i>Torchwood</i> season 3 (Children of Earth). Some dark imagery in line with that.<br><br>*<br><br>*<br><br>*<br><br>Jacques jolted into wakefulness, gasping as his heart rate began to settle. No one was in his bed; as his hand hit the back of the couch he realized that <i>he</i> wasn&#39;t in his bed. He rubbed a hand over his face and groaned, wondering how long he&#39;d been out.<br><br>Two hours, going by his watch, though who knew how accurate it was by now. HQ didn&#39;t exactly have a stabilizing effect on timepieces. Sometimes, Jacques found himself wondering how people decided when to celebrate their birthdays.<br><br>How had he even managed to fall asleep? The TV was still on, cycling through a DVD menu--<br><br>A face that could have been his at his most sadly determined flashed across the screen and everything fell into place.<br><br><i>Children of Earth</i>. He&#39;d been watching Children of Earth (the third Torchwood season, not the cheesy Old Earth musical he remembered seeing before he&#39;d been himself) and somehow fallen asleep.<br><br>No wonder he&#39;d had nightmares about sacrificing the Sato children to save everyone in HQ. They were the closest he had to family in this place, and he hadn&#39;t seen them in what, two weeks? A month? It felt like years. And at least they didn&#39;t call him &#39;uncle&#39;, they knew he was a version of one of their dads, but--<br><br>The parallels were still there. They might have been Jack&#39;s children instead of his grandson, and they knew exactly who Jacques was and a very simplified version of what he actually did for a job, and HQ wasn&#39;t currently under attack, and yet--<br><br>And yet all of that couldn&#39;t quite dispel the nightmare of himself in Jack&#39;s place, needing three children to make the signal strong enough to wipe out the shadowy invaders, finding no one else who could serve as a conduit and unable to force the signal through himself in their place--<br><br>Jacques found himself on his feet, heart racing again. <i>No.</i> It was never going to come to that, not ever, and not least because, unlike Alice, he was completely certain that the Satos&#39; mother would actually kill him. And then she&#39;d do it again, and find a way to make it stick, if she was feeling kind enough...<br><br>He couldn&#39;t shake the nightmare. Not when jack harkness the mini-Reaper flew into his shoulder, not when he poured and drank a glass of water (<i>his hands were shaking</i>), and not even when he gave up on drinking and poured the water over his head. Something about it would not let go.<br><br>This was the absolute <i>last</i> time he was going to watch his home canon. <i>Ever</i>.<br><br>But even that resolution wasn&#39;t enough, and he ended up pacing, trying to work off the tension and the shaking and only making it worse. He had to--he had to--<br><br>His first thought was to go see Luxury, but he didn&#39;t think he could bring himself to voice what his subconscious had decided to torture him with, much less find the desire to touch her right now. His second thought was the children again, and it turned into Ruby&#39;s scream and Seren&#39;s closed eyes and <i>Owain</i>--<br><br>No.<br><br>He forced one deep breath and then another. Reluctantly, he went to find a mirror; he&#39;d probably look like hell either way, but at least he could see if his hair needed combing. And then he could grab his jacket (heavy, dark, everything he hadn&#39;t been wearing in the dream) and go to the Nursery.<br><br>After all, what better way to convince every part of his brain that the Satos were still happy and breathing?<br><br>*<br><br>Six-year-old Ruby ran straight for him the moment he walked into her line of sight. &quot;Jacques! Jacques Jacques Jacques--&quot; She stopped shrieking when he went to his knees to hug her, hugging back for a minute before she wriggled free and grabbed his hand. &quot;I made a gold thing and it&#39;s really cool! You take a pencil and you draw on it and then you flip it over and it&#39;s really cool! But you have to draw on the silver side, or it looks weird. Come see!&quot;<br><br>He went--of course he went, he was always going to look at whatever she wanted to show him--trying to hide the shakiness of his breathing. She was alive--she was <i>so</i> alive, and she was going to stay that way if he had to take on every villain in existence to make it happen. She was fine.<br><br>&quot;Where are Seren and Owain?&quot; he asked. Amusement tugged briefly at him: he&#39;d managed to time the question perfectly, landing it in between them arriving at the low art table and Ruby starting to explain her latest art project in more detail.<br><br>Ruby shrugged. &quot;Seren&#39;s making maps so she can go places on her own and Owain&#39;s trying to read or something. I don&#39;t know. I think they&#39;re over there.&quot; She pointed to a corner of the room, past a handful of other kids of varying ages.<br><br>Jacques looked. Seren was there, her little head bent over the piece of paper she was drawing on. A familiar scowl was on her face: the crayon must not be cooperating. Behind her and to her left, Owain sat on a bean bag chair, his lips moving as he sounded out words to himself. As Jacques watched he stopped trying to read, flipping the pages quickly enough that Jacques knew he&#39;d gone back to just looking at the pictures. Then again, he was only five; easy reading didn&#39;t even need to be in his skill set yet. As his mother had said once, it was just that much more time that they got to spend reading to him.<br><br>Jacques took a deep breath in and let it out, relieved when it didn&#39;t shudder. &quot;Alright,&quot; he said to Ruby, and sat down where he&#39;d be able to see her, her artwork, and her younger siblings. He even managed a smile. &quot;Tell me about your cool foil thing.&quot;<br><br>Ruby happily obliged.<br><br>*<br><br>*<br><br>Another note: this ended up leaning more towards the determined side of hope. Less the &#39;I wish this would happen and I hope it will&#39; side and more &#39;I hope this will happen and I will do anything to make it real&#39; side. The first third has been mildly edited by me; the rest got only as much editing as happens when one reads back a sentence to know how to continue and ends up changing a word or two. I don&#39;t know how long it is--maybe about 1k? Word count in Microsoft Word says 1,003 words. Not quite a drabble, more of a one-shot. Comments and concrit welcome; this may eventually become canon. It&#39;s certainly in line with it.<br><br>I think I&#39;m out of time to drop a review on anything right now, but hopefully ( :) ) I&#39;ll get there tomorrow night or Sunday.<br><br>~Zing</p>

            <p><i>I&#39;m a machine.</i><br><br>It was an odd thought, even by the standards of Time Lords. Of course she wasn&#39;t <i>actually</i> a machine. There were no hidden cogs or artificial myomers lurking beneath the skin; her experiences in the Time War had given her ample opportunity to check, sometimes from several directions at once. The Notary thought back on those mad days of pain, the ones she&#39;d convinced herself she&#39;d left behind like a badly-developed photo of someone else&#39;s skiing holiday... then she stopped, and took another long swig from her glass of amasec, and turned over the page in the Rudi&#39;s accounting dataslate.<br><br>She knew her drinking was excessive. Knowing and caring were two very different things. Her former self - the one she&#39;d been forcibly reintroduced to by a Sue-Wraith of monstrous proportions - had drank excessively because she attended all the best parties in all the most fashionable galaxies, because she was welcome there. Her roaring years. A girl in every spaceport, sometimes with her atrocious megacorp husband&#39;s private army filling the air with laser fire ever so slightly too far behind. So many came with her, over the years. One stayed, though, just the one. The only one that version of her had ever needed.<br><br>She was so lost in her reminiscing that she didn&#39;t notice who had sat down next to her.<br><br>&quot;How&#39;re you holding up?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Hmwha? Oh. Hello, Agent the Clown. Wobbles the Agent? I&#39;m still not quite sure of the protocol-&quot;<br><br>&quot;Try friend.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I don&#39;t have any friends. You&#39;ve been inside my head, you know that better than anyone, with the possible exception of Moon Moon. And that entirely depends on how much she remembers through the fug of regeneration sickness...&quot;<br><br>&quot;Well, ya won&#39;t with <i>that</i> attitude. Try it out! See how it feels.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I...&quot; The Notary paused. &quot;You&#39;re not filming this, are you?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Uh, where exactly am I gonna put a camera and not have it explode?&quot;<br><br>&quot;You know exactly what I mean. Is this a bit? A little skit for your television program wherein the kiddies all get to laugh at how the mean, nasty <i>Time Grump</i>,&quot; and there had never been so much venom in those two words, &quot;just wants to be loved deep down? Will they be laughing at the thought of a vicious old bag with too many dead behind her just wanting to be cared for? Hell, I&#39;d settle for being cared <i>about</i> these days, and not just someone waiting to write an obituary that would&#39;ve constituted a poison pen letter had I been alive.&quot;<br><br>&quot;In vino veritas, I guess. Or in... stuff that smells like wood polish veritas. What even <i>is</i> that?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Amasec. In the grim darkness of the far future there is only war, except when they stop fighting and drink this stuff. Want some?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Uh, sure, I&#39;ll bite. Chyeah, that&#39;s how you know I&#39;m not filming. No alcohol refs in the 2-11 demo.&quot; Wobbles took a small, tentative sip... then made a noise like a cat trying to projectile-vomit into a malfunctioning garbage disposal unit.<br><br>The Notary couldn&#39;t help but throw back her head and howl with laughter, nearly knocking the dataslate off the bar. &quot;Oh, Wobbles, your face is a <i>picture</i>!&quot;<br><br>&quot;I REGRET EVERYTHING. EVER.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I&#39;d take a photo, but that&#39;d be grossly hypocritical.&quot;<br><br>Wobbles had a pithy rejoinder at the ready, but she was too busy trying to scrape her tongue clean with a folding steel wig comb. &quot;How can you sit there and drink that, Notary?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Very easily. I perch on a barstool, raise it to my lips, and swallow. Then I repeat the process until there are at least three barstools. It&#39;s an intense training regime, but I like to think I&#39;ve become something of an expert.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Gawd, Notary, that pun was worse than how that stuff tasted. I didn&#39;t think that was possible!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Nothing&#39;s impossible with the judicious application of self-belief, alcohol, and zero talent for the task involved.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Ugh. Hey, um, sir? My usual, please. And make it a double.&quot; The barman nodded, though he looked a bit pale.<br><br>The Notary, still smiling, looked at Wobbles. &quot;You have a usual? I&#39;ve barely ever seen you in here.&quot;<br><br>&quot;My therapist and I used to come here a lot when I was in FicPsych, and the gang here never forget a drink order.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Huh. Live and learn.&quot;<br><br>&quot;How&#39;s your own FicPsych stuff going?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Well, we haven&#39;t gone out for a drink yet, if that&#39;s what you&#39;re asking.&quot; The Notary shrugged. &quot;I&#39;m taking it slow. It&#39;s a big step, and I&#39;ve been out of the decrazification pool for a while now. I&#39;ve been considering water wings.&quot;<br><br>Wobbled snrgled, a weird snorting sort of laughter that seemed slightly out of place coming out of a clown&#39;s painted face; it was more suitable by far for the person underneath. &quot;Y&#39;know, you&#39;re actually pretty funny when you&#39;re not beating people up.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Thank you for saying so - Rassilon&#39;s bones, woman, what the hell is that?&quot;<br><br>&quot;My drink order!&quot; Wobbles beamed.<br><br>The barman, struggling somewhat under the weight of it, had set a frankly enormous milkshake on the bar beside Wobbles with an audible crash. The word milkshake, though, didn&#39;t do it justice. When milkshakes went to meet the Great Big Flavoured Milk Product In The Sky, this was what they thought such a being would look like. There were crushed pecans. There was ice cream. There was whipped cream. There was something a passing Flareon inwardly hoped was chocolate custard. There were miniature brownies, there were tiny marshmallows, there were umbrellas, there were sparklers. And jutting from the side like the wrath of God, if God was plastic and bent into interesting shapes, was the kind of bendy straw that children&#39;s dreams are made of. It was bright pink.<br><br>The Notary gaped.<br><br>Wobbles just grinned. &quot;You wanna try a slurp?&quot;<br><br>&quot;... Well, fair&#39;s fair, you tried mine.&quot;<br><br>Wobbles pushed the glass over with surprisingly little effort, a dribble of ice cream in its wake. The Notary inspected it much as other people would a landmine that just went click. &quot;What flavour is it, Wobbles?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Uh-uh, no questions. You didn&#39;t tell me what amasec tasted like, now didja!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Would you have believed me?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Don&#39;t change the subject.&quot;<br><br>After another inspection, during which the Notary nibbled on a bit of pecan nut and was gleefully informed that it didn&#39;t count, the Time Lord finally bit the bullet and gave it a slurp.<br><br>She came to from the sugar high about twenty minutes later, finding herself in a FicPsych ward balanced on top of an enormous, gyrating fir tree. The nurses, who were rather more understanding once Wobbles showed up and even deigned to help her down, informed the Notary that she had proclaimed herself the prettiest sugarplum fairy in all the land, and that she deserved to be atop a pretty Christmas tree, no matter whether or not it was time for his nap.<br><br>The Time Lord looked at her partner. Her partner grinned back at her like a trickster god.<br><br>&quot;That,&quot; said the Notary, &quot;explains <i>so</i> much.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Prolly!&quot; Wobbles beamed. &quot;Still think you&#39;re a robot?&quot;<br><br>&quot;What makes you think I-&quot; The Notary paused, thinking back. &quot;Did I say that out loud?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yup.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Well... yes. A little bit.&quot;<br><br>Wobbles nodded. &quot;Thought you might. Don&#39;t worry, stuff like this takes time.&quot;<br><br>&quot;You&#39;re right. It does.&quot; The Notary removed some stray needles that had been lodged somewhere uncomfortable. &quot;But then again, I&#39;m a Time Lord. If there&#39;s one thing we&#39;ve got, it&#39;s that.&quot;<br><br>And they walked off after that, and told each other stories.</p>

            <p>And why is it legal? One slurp for an intense, hallucinatory high?! That (and the &quot;gyrating fir tree&quot;) is perfectly absurd -- and hilarious. Which is a good description of this story :)<br><br>I have one question: where are they? I&#39;m guessing Rudi&#39;s: eventually the Notary mentions they&#39;re sitting at a bar, and she does have the Rudi&#39;s accounting dataslate with her (although she could presumably carry that with her to work on wherever she pleased). But I think this story would be better if the location was made clear earlier on in the story. <br><br>Not to mention, how many people are around? They don&#39;t seem to be concerned about other people overhearing, but the conversation isn&#39;t <i>too</i> personal -- and they&#39;re both being influenced by various substances which lower inhibitions. Still, it&#39;s strange that they&#39;re basically alone until Wobbles calls over the barman. And then suddenly there&#39;s a Flareon passing by in the middle of the description of Wobbles&#39; drink, a Flareon who is never mentioned again. If you&#39;re trying to use this random passerby to add a sense of place, that they&#39;re somewhere semipublic, I&#39;d recommend introducing that descriptive element earlier in the story -- adding it halfway through is a bit jarring.<br><br>On the whole, this is a very sweet and funny story. I like how the Notary&#39;s relationship with Wobbles is evolving, and how close they&#39;re becoming ^.^ So cute. And so much of your phrasing is spot-on (&quot;left behind like a badly-developed photo of someone else&#39;s skiing holiday&quot; has to be my favorite).<br><br>I love your writing style and your characters. Keep up the good work!<br><br>--Key</p>

            <p>“It’s over,” said Guardsman Alorandosenar. “We’re backed into a corner and this time there’s no cavalry to save us.” He took a shaky sip of water from his canteen and stared blankly at the trench wall in front of him. “Two hundred Daleks versus twenty-four of us...”<br><br>Over to his left, a shot from a Dalek dissector cannon blasted the operator of an automatic staser gun off of the parapet, reducing him to a pile of ashes in the blink of an eye. <br><br>“Twenty-three. But my point still stands— we’re all dead.” He leaned forward and rested his helmeted head against the wall, closed his eyes, and sighed. “We fought an endless war just to die in a hole in the ground on Gallifrey.”<br><br>“Chin up, soldier,” said Sergeant Major Emiranlanoamar as he made his way to the abandoned automatic staser and pulled it off the parapet, scooping up the fallen soldier&#39;s ID tags in the same motion. “We’re not going out without a fight— it’s the least we can do for the civilians we’re got in the bunker up there,” he added, nodding towards the structure in question. <br><br>“With respect, sir: I’m just so <i>tired</i>,” replied the guardsman. “We’ll fight, yes, but what’s the point?”<br><br>“Every Dalek that doesn’t make it off Gallifrey is a Dalek that won’t go on to terrorize the universe at large,” said the sergeant major. “What we’ll do here is win a delaying action: we&#39;re buying time for the younger races of the universe to prepare for confrontation with the Daleks. The Kaleds have exhausted themselves to bring themselves here— they aren’t coming out of the War as a huge threat.”<br><br>“It’s not fair.” The guardsman gripped his staser carbine tighter. “It’s not <i>fair</i>. They keep winning and winning and winning and they can’t be stopped and they can’t be reasoned with and...&quot; He sighed. “I want this to be ov— argh!”<br><br>A sudden hiss of static over the squad-comms made both soldiers jump a little, then came an encrypted message from the Gallifreyan War Council, displayed over their retinal heads-up-displays:<br><br><br>///<br><br>MESSAGE: PRIORITY_ABSOLUTE //<br><br>DOCTOR IN ORBIT AROUND GALLIFREY //<br><br>ALL 13 SELVES PRESENT //<br><br>HAS PLANS TO TELEPORT ENTIRE PLANET MINUS HOSTILE ELEMENTS TO SAFETY //<br><br>FINAL ORDERS: DEFEND AT ALL COSTS //<br><br>VICTORY IS IN SIGHT, LEND US YOUR STRENGTH FOR JUST A FEW MORE MINUTES //<br><br>GALLIFREY STANDS //<br><br>///<br><br><br>As the guardsman blinked away the afterimage of the text, he saw an outstretched hand raised towards him. He looked up at the sergeant major. <br><br>“On your feet,” he said. “Hope ain’t dead yet.”</p>

            <p>I like it! Okay, okay, I know it needs to be longer than that.<br><br>So whilst I know quite a bit about Doctor Who I&#39;m personally not a massive fan of it myself, and with this I feel like I don&#39;t need to be. It may just be like that because I love the Day of the Doctor (more for the music, but hey). It&#39;s written from a perspective that, as far as I&#39;m aware anyway, is never really touched upon in Doctor Who. And I really get that feeling of hopelessness at the start as The Guardsman watches what must be another friend or fellow soldier die and the insurmountable odds that are facing them. I like the interaction between the Sergeant Major and The Guardsman, with the former trying his level best to keep what must not just be The Guardsman but also each of the other twenty-two men in the unit fighting. And then that short final bit after the message is received, it&#39;s direct, to the point and just encapsulates what the whole thing is about in four words. &quot;Hope ain&#39;t dead yet.&quot;<br><br>There were a couple of SPaG issues, but it&#39;s really not that bad. The main thing I was confused about was the capitalization of Guardsman and Sergeant Major which are capitalized when they are first mentioned but then aren&#39;t for the rest of the prompt. The other thing I really want to mention is that the Sergeant Major always uses &#39;said&#39; and there never seems to be any hints that they aren&#39;t in a tench desperately fighting for their lives. I wouldn&#39;t mind seeing either a bit more emotion in how the words are actually said, or even say have one part interrupted as either one of the Sergeant Major or the Guardsman has to try and dodge a shot or something like that, something to say &#39;yes we are still in a war zone and we&#39;re not just chatting about this five miles from the front lines.&#39;<br><br>Overall though I really enjoyed reading this through, so thanks for that.<br><br>Novastorme<br></p>

            <p>&quot;Sergeant Major&quot; and &quot;Guardsman&quot; are capitalized when they&#39;re first given and then not at all because they&#39;re used here as rank rather than the sort of chosen title that renegades (see: the Doctor, the Master, almost every HQ Time Lord) tend to use. They&#39;re capitalized when given with the name of each Time Lord, but then are used not as a title but to denote the rank of each. Think of...let&#39;s say &#39;professor,&#39; since I&#39;m leaving for class in an hour. You would call your teacher &quot;Professor Lieber&quot; (unless it&#39;s a really informal class, I guess), but when you&#39;re referring to them, you&#39;d say &quot;the prof&quot; or &quot;the professor&quot;--no capitalization. Unless, of course, your prof recently turned out to be a Time Lord who uses Lieber as a false name and actually goes by the renegade name of the Professor, but that would be kind of odd in the real world.<br><br>(Fun fact? In SeaTurtle&#39;s story, the sergeant major is actually the character we know in the PPC as the Guardsman. His real name is Emiranlanoamar.)<br><br>Hope that clears things up a little.<br><br>~Zing</p>

            <p><i>(A/N: I&#39;m glad this prompt challenge has swung by, because I&#39;ve been putting off this little drabble for far too long and I needed an excuse to put it in writing. I think it works well with the theme anyhow, too, so there&#39;s that.<br><br>Note: This drabble takes place shortly after the events of <a href="https://armorbirdpress.tumblr.com/post/153311479133/rc-333-mission-13-girls-night-out">&quot;Girls&#39; Night Out&quot;</a>.)</i><br><br>**********<br><br>Setting one&#39;s cell phone ringtone to, say, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7yNyhLOIa4">&quot;You Will Know Our Names&quot;</a> from <i>Xenoblade Chronicles</i> is a relatively simple accomplishment. Manually setting an RC console&#39;s voice call alert tone to that tune, though, is a whole new level of technical expertise which, as one techie had described once, required at least three signed permits from the Flowers, professional knowledge of two or more operating systems, up to five successful consecutive bypasses of the network firewall system, the usage of eight different server backdoors, and an entire roll of duct tape.<br><br>Despite being a Colony 9 engineer, at least prior to certain events he wasn&#39;t too keen on repeating, a certain Honedge gijinka from RC #88224646BA was sorely lacking in any of those. As such, he&#39;d had to resort to the alternative that was less likely to lead to accidental electrocution: paging the Flowers with a minor request to change the notification tone remotely by way of the network settings.<br><br>As proud as he had been of this accomplishment at the time, Backslash had stopped looking forward to hearing that familiar opening electric guitar riff ever since he&#39;d run afoul of a certain someone he wouldn&#39;t name to anybody who asked him where he&#39;d gotten that bite mark on his arm. So when said guitar riff suddenly blared at maximum volume from the console speakers one day, he regretted not being flexible enough to stick his head between his legs and kiss his lower cheeks goodbye. Especially after checking the caller ID and finding that it was from that very same someone.<br><br>They <i>would</i> know her name, all right.<br><br>With a sinking feeling in the pit of his stomach, he opened up the call and slipped on his headset. &quot;Whatever you want to say, say it now before I feel even worse.&quot;<br><br><i>&quot;Huh?&quot;</i> The voice on the other end of the line sounded oddly confused. <i>&quot;What makes you think I&#39;d want to do something else I&#39;ll regret later?&quot;</i><br><br>&quot;Lapis, what in the name of the Bionis are you talking about? I&#39;m the one who insulted you in the first place.&quot; Backslash sighed. &quot;And I know I&#39;ve said it before, but I&#39;m sorry. Truly and sincerely. You did not deserve what I said to you that time, and I don&#39;t think anyone does. It was horrible of me to lash out like that, and I can&#39;t even begin to excuse myself...&quot; He trailed off, realizing that he was talking too much. No doubt making Lapis even more annoyed than she already was.<br><br>There was a moment of total silence before the untangler spoke.<br><br><i>&quot;I&#39;m sorry, too.&quot;</i><br><br>Backslash&#39;s eyes widened in shock. &quot;<i>You&#39;re</i> sorry?! I&#39;m the-&quot;<br><br><i>&quot;I know. And I still haven&#39;t quite forgiven you for it. But I should&#39;ve stopped at that, and if I&#39;d had the sense to do so sooner I wouldn&#39;t have hurt so many feelings.&quot;</i><br><br>&quot;...uh, come again?&quot;<br><br>There was a sigh from the other end of the line. <i>&quot;In the months since our first encounter, I started finding myself stewing over your awful words, particularly the notion that I don&#39;t deserve to be the agent I am because I was dumb enough to get my arm bitten off. It reminded me that I&#39;ve had people tell me before that I hadn&#39;t become an agent out of determination, but out of reckless haste, and that going in over my head could cost me more than &#39;just&#39; a limb if I didn&#39;t call it quits.&quot;</i><br><br>Backslash turned slightly pale. &quot;So, I wasn&#39;t the only one?&quot;<br><br><i>&quot;You were one of the first after I lost my arm. But I&#39;ve had people comment that joining at such a young age might not be very wise. Perhaps it may even sound a little Suvian. Heck, even my own partners thought I wasn&#39;t fit for the job at first just because I was twelve at the time.&quot;</i><br><br>&quot;Well, excuse my bursting their bubble, but Drunky - er, Cupid, I mean - was only a year older than you were when he first joined. Biologically, at least. I know he&#39;s a lot older chronologically, but all those people are hypocrites in light of that.&quot;<br><br><i>&quot;Yeah. He told me that shortly after we&#39;d started work, and my partners pretty much stopped judging me after that - especially after I saved first Sarah, and then a friend from the DMS. I thought I could put the doubts of the dissenters behind me and move forward with my career as an agent - until you came along.&quot;</i><br><br>Backslash&#39;s heart sank. So, she was still angry with him even after his apology. Lovely.<br><br>&quot;So, does that mean you still hold me responsible?&quot;<br><br><i>&quot;Well, here&#39;s a big wham line for you. I don&#39;t. At least, not completely.&quot;</i><br><br>He blinked in shock. &quot;But I - I-&quot;<br><br><i>&quot;I won&#39;t argue that what you said was very, very hurtful, and about as forgettable as the loss of my arm. But the thing is, after we got off on the wrong foot-&quot;</i><br><br>&quot;Understatement.&quot;<br><br>A harsh laugh could be heard from the other end. <i>&quot;True. But it wasn&#39;t you who was responsible for what happened afterward. It was me.&quot;</i><br><br>&quot;Huh? But how? I&#39;m sure you&#39;d strive to make a better example of yourself after hearing a statement so scathing.&quot;<br><br><i>&quot;Yeah, and I tried. But the thing that I did wrong was that I tried <u>way</u> too hard. I know you were worried about my well-being, but when I started out as an agent, my reputation was everything to me. Losing my arm? I could capitalize on that and show off how much more awesome I was for surviving that encounter. But knowing that there were people who thought <u>less</u> of me because of my history, both before and after I joined the PPC, was too much to bear. So I did the only thing I thought I could do: throw others&#39; perception of me out the window with enough force to bust a hole through a three-inch-thick brick wall, and focus on the Duty alone without caring for how anybody else felt.&quot;</i><br><br>He would swear that the <i>pop</i> of his mouth falling open could be heard from Lapis&#39; end.<br><br>&quot;Forgive me for being blunt, Lapis,&quot; he said after a moment of regaining his compusure, &quot;but that is, by and far, the absolute <i>stupidest</i> bloody thing <i>anybody</i> could possibly do in circumstances like this, arm or no arm! Did you once consider the possibility that you&#39;d have to work with another agent team while on a mission? I don&#39;t think the Flowers would agree with me on this, but your reputation <i>is</i> important, at least in a few respects. The better you are at working with other people, the better standing you&#39;ll have as an agent in general. There&#39;s a reason most agents work in groups of at least two, and my partner can attest to the fact that working solo will only hurt you in the long run!&quot;<br><br>There was a deep sigh from the other end. <i>&quot;You&#39;re not the first person to tell me that. And I&#39;m not just talking about what Cupid said when we were working together last winter, either.&quot;</i><br><br>&quot;Huh? Wait, what happened?&quot;<br><br><i>&quot;I went on a mission the other day with Sarah and a couple of friends she&#39;s picked up over the years. They also invited a rival of mine from my Nursery days who, out of jealousy, got into a habit of picking on my supposedly poorly conceived choices in becoming an agent. I swear our bickering could be heard for miles until Sarah decided to step in and separate us so we could think about what we were doing. I won&#39;t get into the rest, but I ended up... well, taking a forced nap of sorts.&quot;</i><br><br>&quot;...ouch. Did you gain a secondary Ghost-type from that?&quot;<br><br><i>&quot;Oh, shut up.&quot;</i> She let out a dry chuckle before continuing. <i>&quot;Anyway... it was a long two or three hours of self-evaluation for me that evening. I eventually came to the realization that I&#39;d taken everyones&#39; remarks about my status far too personally, and for one critical reason.&quot;</i><br><br>Backslash remained silent, waiting for the other shoe to drop.<br><br><i>&quot;My history, my injuries, and especially the loss of one of my closest friends in HQ, in essence, had led to my self-esteem sinking so low that anyone saying that I wasn&#39;t fit to be an agent due to my own rashness could unintentionally cause me to lose the last remaining shred of hope I had for myself. I tried to mask the pain by throwing myself into my responsibilities, acting on the assumption that I had no emotional support whatsover, and it was very, very wrong of me to think that way.</i><br><br><i>&quot;Which leads me to why I called you in the first place: to properly reciprocate your apology.&quot;</i><br><br>The look on Backslash&#39;s face was one of utter disbelief, and to his own surprise, more than a little sympathy. &quot;Dear Bionis, I had no idea you thought that way... Lapis, I know I already told you that I said what I did because I wanted you to not get yourself axed by a Suvian, but if I wasn&#39;t such a boor I&#39;d have tried to say it in a more encouraging manner. Or better yet, not said it at all and waited for you to prove that you really were capable. I had literally no idea that you hated me so much for what actually happened until last December, and I never thought it could ever happen. Honest!&quot;<br><br><i>&quot;There are two sayings that I believe are relevant here, one for each of us. For you, it&#39;s &#39;The road to Hell is paved with good intentions.&#39; And more importantly, for me, it&#39;s &#39;Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity.&#39; I wanted so badly to hate you that I never thought about your actual intentions, and the same can honestly be said of a lot of other people who tried to speak against my haste and bitterness. And for that, I can&#39;t apologize enough.&quot;</i><br><br>Backslash couldn&#39;t help but laugh a little. &quot;We were both dumber than a sack of bricks, in our own ways. And as much as I&#39;d hate to admit this, I think we may have more in common than either of us think. So if it helps you any, I wholeheartedly accept your apology.&quot;<br><br><i>&quot;As I do with yours. And I have to say, this whole conversation is giving me a lot more hope for myself, and also for you. The fact that people are there to listen to both of us, and the fact that we&#39;ve finally been able to listen to each other, really goes to show that this multiverse isn&#39;t as harsh as either of us feared.&quot;</i><br><br>&quot;Wait, how do you know how I feel about HQ?&quot;<br><br><i>&quot;Cupid told me. No doubt after you told <u>him.</u>&quot;</i><br><br>&quot;...oh.&quot;<br><br>There was a nervous laugh from the other end. <i>&quot;So, no hard feelings, right?&quot;</i><br><br>&quot;Well, you <i>did</i> take a chunk out of my arm. But you lost one of yours, so I guess we can call it even!&quot;<br><br>They both laughed this time. Then Lapis spoke.<br><br><i>&quot;I hope you&#39;ll be happy to know that I patched things up with Aiko as well. We now consider each other friendly rivals rather than bitter enemies and, for the record, I&#39;d much prefer that you and I have a similar relationship. Foils to each other, if you will.&quot;</i><br><br>He smiled warmly. &quot;I&#39;d like that more than anything, I think. Though that isn&#39;t gonna keep us from working together again in the future, isn&#39;t it?&quot;<br><br>Lapis&#39; teasing giggle would&#39;ve been music to anybody&#39;s ears, especially given the context. <i>&quot;We&#39;ll see, Buttscratch. We&#39;ll see!&quot;</i></p>

            <p>Looking it up on Wikipedia, the proper term would be &quot;sudden fiction&quot;, which is 750 words or less (my writing piece was 225, I used Microsoft Word to check :P).

            <p>Well, okay, first off: I love it. It&#39;s brilliant. I could practically taste Nume&#39;s frustration. I also think it ends perfectly well where it is - not for the &#39;lost&#39; prompt, but as a harbinger (SIDE NOTE: this is the first time I&#39;ve known that word isn&#39;t &#39;harbringer&#39;, weird what slips through the filters) of the rest of Nume&#39;s long night, that ending is perfect.<br><br>But I think Henry is a little off for a six-year-old. Mostly I&#39;m going to base this off <i>my</i> <s>pet</s> six-year-old, who (in contrast to Henry):<br><br>-Would probably say &#39;Ilraen&#39;. Definitely <i>could</i>, though as a nickname it might stand.<br><br>-Would absolutely have started screaming somewhere in there - probably at &#39;no we&#39;re not going camping&#39; or &#39;no you can&#39;t watch that&#39;.<br><br>-Would be unlikely to actually pay attention to something he was being forced to watch.<br><br>-Would probably say &#39;Mummy&#39;, not &#39;my mummy&#39; - he&#39;d basically treat it as a name when he didn&#39;t absolutely need the qualifier.<br><br>-Would definitely have bugged Nume for help during the game.<br><br>There&#39;s probably more, but that&#39;s what&#39;s jumping out at me.<br><br>Fortunately there is a super-duper easy fix for all of that: make him eight, not six. Even seven might work. Just a year or two to jump him out of the &#39;I am the only person in the universe and you shall not defy me&#39; stage of childhood. I don&#39;t think there&#39;s anything that breaks by doing that, except possibly the timeline (and I&#39;m sure Morgan will lend a hand to patch it up).<br><br>Oh, and this deserves a paragraph to itself: I love the fact that Henry knows not all OCs are Suvians. ^_^ It charms me.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>And, well, upbringing to some extent. Not to criticize! But, I used to babysit for a couple of little boys with rather non-disciplinary or at least inconsistent parents, and they weren&#39;t just screamers, they drove people at my church crazy. Like, people were slightly in awe of my ability to put up with these kids, that&#39;s how unruly they could be. They found out pretty quickly that it didn&#39;t work on me, though (my response to tantrums, learned from my brother&#39;s and my upbringing, is basically &quot;LOL, it&#39;s funny that you think that will get you anything but a red face and a timeout&quot;), and we mostly got along great. ^<em>^<br><br>Also babysat for another little boy who was naturally pretty quiet and serious, and he hardly needed more than a stern look and an &quot;I mean it&quot; now and then. He cried sometimes, but never screamed that I recall. Kids are different. {= )<br><br>As for Henry in particular, I think his actual and literary genetics predispose him to being of a quieter persuasion. Baby Harry might&#39;ve been inclined to scream (see: CAPSLOCK OF RAGE), but with the Dursleys, that would almost certainly earn him a quick trip to the broom cupboard with no supper, and epigenetics matter. (This science argument is probably no more than 50% dumb!) Baby Severus... I just can&#39;t see him ever being loud, ever.<br><br>Plus, if Henry&#39;s going to flip his lid, it&#39;s gonna come at the point where he takes off into HQ and makes Nume chase him. So... the plot demands it? ^</em>^;<br><br>The rest, I will consider, and thank you! I can&#39;t take the easy fix, it would <i>super</i> break the timeline. {= )<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>&quot;Help me Obi Wan you&#39;re my only...&quot;<br>The quote cut out as Theo promptly answered the incoming call, already making his way out of Rudi&#39;s where he&#39;d gone for a private drink. <br>&quot;Where are we needed Kaatah?&quot; He asked his partner through the communicator in built into his Omni-tool, which had been a &#39;present&#39; from Kaatah after their first, and thankfully only, trip into the Mass Efect Universe.<br>&quot;It&#39;s another Harry Potter Sue &#39;fic.&quot; Kaatah answered from their RC, trying to get everything sorted out. &quot;A couple of misconceptions by the Suethor means The Forest of Dean has grown over not just all of Wales, but also on the backs of some whales as well. All the other DoGA teams are busy or not responding...&quot;<br>&quot;And they need it burnt down? Answer them and say we&#39;ll be there in a sec.&quot; Theo responded, walking through the halls of HQ, finding his way to his RC relatively easily given that his mind was focused on the fact that he&#39;d soon be burning down large swathes of uncanonical forests for fun. Entering his RC he nodded to Kaatah as he quickly got himself into his armour with the help of Kaatah. Putting on his helmet Theo smiled as the HUD confirmed all systems were operational, not that he needed all of them, but it was comforting to know nonetheless. <br>&quot;So, how are we going to explain this in the &#39;fic?&quot; He asked.<br>Kaatah shrugged, &quot;Couple of cosplayers with fancy gadgets? Hopefully it won&#39;t be an issue, but the DMS team on the ground just said they needed the extra firepower DoGA normally provide for these sorts of things.&quot;<br>&quot;Fair enough then, you ready to go?&quot;<br>Kaatah didn&#39;t verbally respond, instead punching in a couple of commands into the console before jumping through the now-opened portal. Theo shrugged before following suit.<br>---***---<br>Apollo looked up as a new portal appeared in the air a few feet above the now enlarged Forest of Dean. Noticing the familiar shape of a Quarian falling the small distance, he smiled. DoGA had arrived it seemed, especially seeing the second figure fly through the portal, jetpack and flamethrower roaring almost from the off.<br>Kaatah smiled at the archer, not that he could see it behind her faceplate. &quot;You did tell him there was a large amount of forest to set fire to, he&#39;s been hoping for something like this for a while. <br>Apollo shook his head and laughed as Kelly ran up to the agents, &quot;Kaatah, Theo thank the Gods you&#39;re here. You&#39;re our only hope.&quot;</p>

            <p>The first thing that jumps out at me is the formatting: You gotta offset your paragraphs somehow, whether by indenting the first line of each new paragraph (standard in print, difficult in HTML-only online spaces) or by putting a line of whitespace between paragraphs (standard online; hit Enter twice when you start a new paragraph, it&#39;s easy). This makes your text much easier for people&#39;s eyes to track.<br><br>This is a new paragraph. See? It&#39;s super-clear with that line of whitespace between this one and the last one. You can&#39;t miss it. {= )<br><br>Here&#39;s another one, where I&#39;m going to talk about other stuff. There were some SPaG issues, mostly to do with commas and with capitalization around dialogue, but I&#39;m gonna suppress the urge to get into those in detail for this challenge.<br><br>What I liked: seeing DOGA doing what they do best. I like the &quot;response team&quot; thing that some departments naturally lend themselves to, when they can show up to do just the job they&#39;re trained to do instead of necessarily always tagging along for a whole mission. That&#39;s also fine and good, but too many agents on a team tends to really bog things down (IMO, four is the top limit of bearability in most cases), and this could be a good format for a different sort of spin-off, which could be fun. I also liked the concept of the Forest of Dean being expanded over whales. Typos are fun. Always make the most of a good typo. ^_^<br><br>What I would change: I&#39;m of the firm opinion that agents should use canonical disguises and methods whenever possible. You can get away with not being in disguise if you&#39;re a human in a human-centric universe (or an alien in an alien-filled universe, etc.) with no OCs involved, e.g. most Bad Slash missions, but I think futuristic tech in a magical universe is going too far, even if the OC is gone already. If you really must go the technological route over a magical one, the <i>Harry Potter</i> universe does have Muggle flamethrowers, napalm, agent orange, etc.—but why would you do that when you have magic available?<br><br>Also, I&#39;m a little unclear on how far the DOGA agents fell from their portal. &quot;Above the now enlarged Forest of Dean&quot; suggests to me that they fell from above the treetops, which is not a small distance at all. Did you mean a few feet above the forest floor? Consider also that Apollo&#39;s visibility will be limited by the trees, depending on their density, wherever they pop in.<br><br>One last thing: this is the correct rendering of the quote and of Obi-Wan&#39;s name: &quot;Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You&#39;re my only hope.&quot;<br><br>That&#39;s it. Considering I cheated, kudos on actually writing from the prompt in a way that fits. {= )<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>First of all thank you for the concrit and I&#39;m sorry it&#39;s taken me this long to reply. <br><br>1) Yeah, I know this. I know I know this, and yet somehow I completely forgot to do this. Thanks for pointing it out and I&#39;m really annoyed looking back now that I did this. <br><br>2) SPaG. I&#39;m improving, but I know that I&#39;m still weak in those areas (was never really taught how to do it at school), but I&#39;m trying to improve on it, so thanks for at the very least pointing out that I still have a ways to go.<br><br>3) Thanks, having some kind of response team is kind of what I want to do with Theo and Kaatah, although having one of them tag along on a mission would also be quite fun I think. &quot;No Theo. You can&#39;t burn down the &#39;Sue, we&#39;re in Hogwarts.&quot; Could quite easily happen. I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;m getting confused or if I didn&#39;t quite explain it correctly in the prompt but Apollo and Kelly are my DMS agents who Theo and Kaatah are arriving to help. Originally I was going to have Kaatah do some training with them before Theo turned up, but now I&#39;m considering just having them interact several times instead. Being half Welsh I&#39;m always annoyed when people imply half my family used to live on the backs of aquatic animals, and I&#39;ve seen the Forest of Dean placed in so many parts of Britain, it&#39;s probably happened at one point or another.<br><br>4) I understand where you are coming from and think I could have done a better job with that bit. Theo is a cyborg Mandalorian from the Star Wars universe (specifically The Old Republic), and even though his wife is a Jedi he is still rather suspicious of magic and the like, something that is still carried over into the PPC. I think I could probably write a funny scene with Theo complaining about having to use a normal flamethrower with its huge fuel tank etc. over his wrist mounted one and Kaatah getting exasperated over the whole thing. I&#39;m definitely going to re-write this and try and work these bits out.<br><br>5) I mean a few feet above the forest floor. Sorry for the confusion once again. <br><br>6) I should probably stop relying on pop culture for those kinds of quotes (No, I haven&#39;t seen the original Star Wars trilogy. Yes I probably am some sort of heretic). Thanks<br><br>Novastorme<br><br><br> </p>

            <p>Elanor wasn&#39;t even six months old and already, she was a terror.<br><br>Everything that came within her reach soon found its way to her mouth, and even though the Time Tot wasn&#39;t crawling yet, the Aviator still went ahead and childproofed all the cabinets the baby could reach. She shuddered to think of Elanor beginning to crawl the instant she glanced away, of Elanor getting into the cabinets and becoming stuck or worse, deciding she&#39;d just wandered into her brand-new toybox.<br><br>&quot;Mmmmm,&quot; Elanor hummed from her spot on the carpet, and the Aviator lay down in front of her so they were at eye level. &quot;MMMMM!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Mummy?&quot; the Aviator said hopefully. &quot;Can you say mummy? Or mama?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Mmm.&quot; Elanor stuffed the wingtip of her plush owl, Feathers, into her mouth. The Aviator sighed, thinking how she&#39;d just washed that toy. Oh, well. It could survive another day or two as long as it wasn&#39;t covered in spit-up.<br><br>&quot;I&#39;m back,&quot; Zeb announced as the door to the TARDIS swung open and he emerged, holding a stack of books. &quot;Look, Ellie! <i>The Very Hungry Caterpie</i>, <i>Good Night Lunatone</i>, <i>The Litten King</i>! I loved it when my trainer read us these stories!&quot;<br><br>&quot;ZA!&quot; Elanor screamed, flopping over onto her back and pointing at him.<br><br>&quot;Did she just—?&quot; Zeb nearly dropped the books he was holding. &quot;Yeah, Ellie, good job! I&#39;m Uncle Za!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Zazazazazazaza!&quot; Elanor went on, happily bobbing her head with every noise.<br><br>The Aviator smiled and picked up her daughter, blowing a raspberry on her little round tummy. &quot;I gave birth to you and you repay me by saying Uncle Zeb&#39;s name first?&quot;<br><br>Elanor just giggled and kept on yelling &quot;Za!&quot; over and over. She didn&#39;t seem intent on stopping any time soon.<br><br>&quot;They grow up so fast,&quot; Zeb said in an overly-choked-up voice, and pretended to wipe away a tear.<br><br>The Aviator looked down at Elanor, who just smiled back, the tips of two baby teeth peeking out from her smile. &quot;Yeah,&quot; she said, kissing her forehead. &quot;They do.&quot;<br><br>—————<br><br>Something something hope for the future generations something I just wanted to write fluff. Is this long enough? Are vignettes okay or do they need to be longer?</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve probably said this before, but I absolutely love that you&#39;re basing this series on an old fic of yours.  Even though we aren&#39;t familiar with Agent Turbo&#39;s original story, it still gives an interesting sense of history and complexity to his character, that most agents don&#39;t tend to have.  I love it!  I also love the contrast it provides between Turbo having reformed from his days in the old fic, and Vera remaining true to her motivations in the original story, recast through the lens of a Suvian.  It&#39;s sort of like a narrative representation of your development as a writer over the years!<br><br>I also see that the thing I&#39;ve been dreading isn&#39;t as bad as I thought.  I was worried you were killing off your agents (sans Corolla) to account for them being missing during the future part of the Blackout, but it looks like they&#39;re just retiring instead.  Guess I should have assumed the simplest explanation!<br><br>—doctorlit gushes fanboy all over the Board</p>

            <p>Also, it is nice to see how solid is my references to Vera&#39;s part of Sergio&#39;s backstory... &#39;cause that actually isn&#39;t from the fic. Vera and Ami actually never appeared in Mai Dire Fine. They&#39;re from another project of mine (scrapped for various reasons) which was used as a source of stuff for covering the years between Agent!Sergio joining the PPC (January 2009 HST, which is actually a year and half before I discovered the PPC) and the last chapters of his original fic (set around July 2007 HST)<br><br>One of the reason I&#39;m making this unpublished &quot;middle&quot; part appear more than the actually published badfic plot-wise is that I simply don&#39;t own most of the other original characters, and thus I&#39;m pretty limited on what I can do with them. That&#39;s what happen when you have no less than <i>six</i> people working together.<br><br>I do have permission (and even some help in writing) by one of the other authors to use hers, but I lost contact with two other authors (one of which is the owner of some really important characters, like Pyro) and have only sporadic contact with the last two.<br><br>It goes without saying that I don&#39;t feel comfortable using those characters without their original authors knowing, and so I am limited on either just having Sergio mention them, or let them appear in translated fic quotes (not newly-made flashbacks as the one in this chapter)</p>

            <p>That&#39;s going to make for a seriously messed-up bracket.

            <p>More seriously, it&#39;s not actually possible to <i>win</i> a battle with just suicide mons. Leaving aside physical walls, types that resist or are immune to Normal-type moves (your exception there being Mega Glalie, which gets an Ice-type boom courtesy of Refrigerate), and moves like Protect, you can, at best, get a draw - and because you killed your own &#39;mon to do it, it still counts as a loss for you.<br><br>It&#39;s a nice idea, but there are much more irritating troll teams out there.

            <p>right. :(<br><br>The Pokemon lines which can both negate Damp and hit Ghosts are: Psyduck, Zigzagoon, Skitty, Spoink, Buneary, Deerling, Sawsbuck, and Pancham.

            <p>When it comes to building weird sets, there&#39;s no better mon for the job than Smeargle. Sure, its stats are fairly garbage, but through Sketch it can learn almost ANY move (there are some exceptions, but I forget precisely what they are). You can get a few moves that change the opponent&#39;s type - Soak, Forest&#39;s Curse, and Trick Or Treat all change the opponent&#39;s type rather than your own, and since your objective with this is to keep them off-balance and off their guard, these moves are very definitely your friends. Well, maybe not Trick Or Treat, but wevs. =]<br><br>As you rightly attest, Kecleon&#39;s abilities make it really fit in with the theme, but it&#39;s not the only person to get them - Greninja is a really cool Pokémon and popular in OU for exactly this reason. Access to Protean allows you to constantly deal extra damage from your attacks, switching it up constantly. It&#39;s a really powerful ability and I think you could do a lot worse than have a Protean user on your team, though there isn&#39;t one that learns Metronome apart from top kek. =]<br><br>This has been really enlightening discussion - thinking about battling ideas that are weird and unexpected is good for both of us! =]</p>

            <p>Unless there&#39;s a really solid set of four moves that you can&#39;t get anywhere else, I don&#39;t think I&#39;d want it on the team. Though, that said, the Soak-F&#39;Curse-ToT-Metronome setup would be suitably hilarious. Sure, Smeargle couldn&#39;t take advantage of it, but it&#39;d be worth it to see the look on their faces!

Sadly it can&#39;t learn Metronome, otherwise I would absolutely have used it here.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m guessing there might be some weird stuff like Eject Button and Red Card. I need to look through the item registry again, there&#39;s a bounty of odd items in there. My favourite back in Gen 5 was Flame Orb Sigilyph with Psycho Shift, which allowed it to burn the opponent reliably.

            <p>This was supposed to be a thread about <a href="https://physics.le.ac.uk/jist/index.php/JIST/article/view/109/65">this weird scientific paper</a> I found. Here&#39;s the abstract:<br><br><i>The Fellowship of the Ring were supposed to travel from Imraldis to the forges of Mt. Doom in order to destroy the One Ring of Sauron. For an ideal journey with all 9 members of the fellowship, using the metabolic rates for each species from [2], the total calorific consumption of the 92-day journey was found to be 1,780,214.59 kcal. If the elves of Imraldis had provided the Fellowship with lembas, this would equate to them having to carry a total of 675 pieces, or 75 pieces each. For the different species, this equates to 304 for the hobbits, 214 for Gandalf, Aragorn and Boromir; 99 for Gimli and 60 for Legolas.</i><br><br>I had this whole thing where I was going to point out the published mini-Balrog, query the social assumptions (<i>lembas</i>, from Rivendell?!), and say Look, This Is An Actual Journal!<br><br>Then I looked at the references.<br><br>So <i>then</i> this was supposed to be a thread about how these same nutters also published <a href="https://physics.le.ac.uk/jist/index.php/JIST/article/view/88/55">this delightfully wacky paper</a>, which calculates the base metabolic rates of the races of Middle-earth by comparing them to various animals. Humans are calculated from foxes, because… I guess there&#39;s no data out there on human metabolisms? I&#39;unno.<br><br>Anyway, then I was going to predict that their third paper would clearly be an attempt to work out what real-world food <i>lembas</i> most resembled, based on its calorific content. It was gonna be awesome.<br><br>But then I looked at the journal.<br><br>So <b>now</b> this is a post about how amazingly weird the University of Leicester is. The Natural Sciences/Interdisciplinary Science Department publishes the <a href="https://physics.le.ac.uk/jist/index.php/JIST/issue/archive">Journal of Interdisciplinary Science Topics</a>. The articles are written and peer-reviewed by their undergraduates, as part of their course, and it&#39;s all published, open-access, on the internet. Amazing!<br><br>And the topics of their papers are glorious. &quot;How many lies could Pinocchio tell before it became lethal?&quot; &quot;DNA Profiling: How Long is the Golden Snitch’s Flesh Memory?&quot; &quot;The Force Required to Stretch Elastigirl’s Arm.&quot; There&#39;s material here for a dozen threads, it&#39;s awe-inspiring!<br><br>So go find it. Pick out your favourite paper from the six volumes of <a href="https://physics.le.ac.uk/jist/index.php/JIST/issue/archive">the journal</a>, and tell us what&#39;s in it! Can you top &#39;675 <i>lembas</i> cakes&#39; as a scientific result? Go at it.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Howdy folks. First things first: upon his departure, Desdendelle turned over control of the Discord server to me. You may all bow before my awesome grandeur, etc.<br><br>Secondly, the Discord has two new mods! In addition to myself and Cat-on-the-Keyboard, we now have the guiding hands of Maslab and Delta Juliette! You may also bow before their awesome grandeur. Seriously though, many thanks to the both of you for stepping up and helping. It&#39;s very much appreciated.<br><br>Finally, we recently suffered through a small infestation of rather noxious trolls. Rules were flouted, people were insulted, and so banhammers were swung. As a result, we have decided that only the channel moderators will be able to issue instant invites to the Discord right now. If you&#39;re already in the channel right now, then nothing will really change. If you&#39;re NOT in the channel and want to get in, then you will need to speak with one of the people I previously mentioned.<br><br>Thanks for your time!<br><br>PC<br><br><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/DfOoyRG4Q5S6s/giphy.gif"></p>

            <p>As PC said: <i>&quot;If you&#39;re NOT in the channel and want to get in, then you will need to speak with <b>one of the people I previously mentioned.</b>&quot;</i> This means invites can also be handed out by Cat, Maslab, or Delta as well. It&#39;s a step up from one and only one person deciding whether or not someone can join the chat, at least.<br><br>And I wasn&#39;t there when the trolls invaded the Discord, but I&#39;ve nonetheless read about instances of online chatrooms with public links being visited by less-than-savory people before, so to some extent I can actually understand where PC is coming from. Sure, this probably isn&#39;t the best option for keeping our community open and welcoming, but in light of recent events I honestly feel that it&#39;s better to err on the side of caution. A chatroom that can guarantee the locking out of bad people is, in the long term, actually a more welcoming option than one that&#39;s open at its own risk, at least in my opinion.</p>

            <p>I disagree vehemently with the idea that any portion of the PPC community should be members-only. We are an open community. We welcome everyone who doesn&#39;t stir up trouble. We don&#39;t say &#39;no, you haven&#39;t been round long enough for us to trust you with the keys to the secret clubhouse&#39;.<br><br>I also just straight up don&#39;t feel <i>comfortable</i> with it. The Discord can be used to attack people behind their backs - we&#39;ve literally just seen that. Now tell me how people who aren&#39;t able to access it should feel about that. How many times have I been discussed on the channel? I&#39;unno - and now I&#39;m reliant on the goodwill of four people if for any reason I want to check. It makes me extremely uncomfortable.<br><br>I&#39;m also bitterly disappointed that <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=306819;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">my argument against the Discord making unilateral decisions</a> has been not so much rejected (I could handle that!) as flat-out ignored. How many people were involved in this decision to wall off half of the PPC community? I know, I&#39;ll just go and check the chat logs to find out what was discussed.<br><br>Oh wait. I can&#39;t.<br><br>hS<br><br>PS: And yes, before you say it, I&#39;m fully aware that any of the four would throw me an invite in an instant. This isn&#39;t about me. But how about someone shiny and new, who&#39;s only posted on the Board once, and maybe doesn&#39;t pay attention to their spelling? Would they get the same no-questions-asked invite? What if they haven&#39;t posted here at <i>all</i>?</p>

            <p>I was present during the troll invasion; at first they acted just crazy, cracking lame jokes, so we (or at least I) thought &quot;Oh, just one of those &#39;lol-so-random&#39; newbies&quot;, not unlike a potential &quot;shiny and new&quot; who may just be like that. So we stayed put. But when they started to spam, and engage one another into a discussion very quickly descending into too creepy with a side of nope, we waited for the mods to finish them off. <br><br>To answer your final questions, even if a newbie posted once, I don&#39;t think they should be in any way excluded from joining Discord. Sure, they may not pay overly attention to their spelling, but that&#39;s not the sole mark of the troll. Neither was that one the role reason they were deemed trolls. <br><br>&quot;What if they haven&#39;t posted here [I assume you mean the Board] at all?&quot; Then how we would know there&#39;s a newbie? Lurkers eventually decide to reveal themselves, and as far as I know that&#39;s when they become newbies, so this argument is kinda invalid (even when they were starting at Discord, they were poked towards the Board very quickly).<br><br><br>That being said, I am in no way convinced that locking up Discord is a good idea, but I can see where the mods stand at with their decision. If it was up to me, however, I would still let the invitation be open to public.     </p>

            <p>1- Yes to all of that. The Discord <i>should</i> be wide open, for all the reasons you&#39;ve stated. <br>2- Judging by the message I got from Discord itself, the trolls were posting links to child pornography. I&#39;m pretty much down with taking measures to deal with that. <br>3- I am assuming this is a temporary measure to deal with the above. Presumably, once Discord the host comes down on the trolls, no more reason to lock it down. <br><br>Okay, that was three things.</p>

            <p>This got a bit bigger than I anticipated. I... Agh, I really hate to do this, but I don&#39;t think I can handle that many people. The idea was for a daily PBP, which would create a bit of strain if you&#39;re looking for something really casual. If you&#39;ve already gotten a character sheet to me, or given me evidence that you&#39;re working on it, or just talked to me about what you want to do with a character, you&#39;re fine, but, uh...

            <p>I&#39;m not sure how often the game would progress, but I&#39;d expect the characters would be advancing at least five Power Levels, which means a total of forty-five Power Points to be gained. Each session gives one Power Point, two if the heroes pull off something truly spectacular. So, assuming that, say, each Power Level has one session granting two Power Points, that&#39;s still a total of forty sessions, and each session is, I&#39;m pretty sure, equivalent to a few hours of gaming. This would be a long haul. ... Good bunnies, what have I gotten myself into? </p>

            <p>Real place, I mean - heaven knows if we allow fictional places everyone will have a list as long as their arm. :D As well it should be! But this is about places that are physically accessible on Earth. (Include pictures! Pictures make everything better.

More than two thousand years ago, the traders of the middle-east carved this gorgeous city out of solid rock. For all the centuries in between, it&#39;s remained basically intact.<br><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/Petra3.jpg"><br><br>You&#39;ve probably run across Petra in popular culture at some point - it&#39;s appeared in the last two <i>Civilisation</i> games, and was the hiding place of the Grail in <i>Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade</i>, among other appearances. It&#39;s located in Jordan, which makes the chances of my ever visiting rather low. But I can dream!<br><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/Petra4.jpg"><br><br>Your turn.

            <p>Can I pick two? I&#39;m picking two.<br><br>My first choice would Nome, Alaska. I&#39;ve wanted to visit the state, and a childhood obsession with Balto left a special place in my heart for Nome.<br><br>The real reason I want to visit Alaska, though, is the Northern Lights. They fascinate me. So beautiful, so otherworldly. They&#39;re about the closest thing Earth has to magic. I&#39;ve always wanted to see them, and I suspect I always will. I could probably see them just as well, if not better, from somewhere like Fairbanks, but Nome is an adventure, and it would mean fulfilling a childhood dream.<br><br>My second choice would be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fingal%27s_Cave">Fingal&#39;s Cave</a> in Scotland. Scotland has always been another curious travel obsession of mine, and the of Staffa is particularly interesting because it actually belonged to my distant family. I like caves, I love Scotland, and I love somewhat obscure family history, how could I resist?</p>

            <p>Well, obviously, the first place on my list of dream destinations is Japan. The week I spent in Tokyo last year was one of the best weeks of my life, and I want to go there again. (Check the <a href="http://astraygenius.tumblr.com/tagged/spring-break-trip">&quot;spring break trip&quot;</a> tag on my Tumblr if you wanna see pictures.) I also told my dad I&#39;d take him with me next time I got to go; my mom came on the first trip, so it&#39;s only fair.<br><br>I&#39;d also like to see a handful of places in the Middle East, but sadly those will have to wait until I know I&#39;ll be safe as an American in those places.<br><br>France would be awesome. I know all the cool stuff and most of the population is in Paris, but honestly I&#39;d be happy if I got to visit any part of the country. Now if only I spoke French...</p>

            <p>I remember, I once had to do an assessment for my Ancient History class, where we had to choose any sort of site, and do a powerpoint on it. I chose Skara Brae, in Orkney:<br><br><img src="http://www.iknow-uk.com/media/cache/thumb_mobile/static_image/9454.jpg" alt="http://www.iknow-uk.com/media/cache/thumb_mobile/static_image/9454.jpg"> <br><br>And I&#39;ve wanted to go to Orkney - Orkney in general - ever since. So windy and cold, they don&#39;t get much trees there, and their mythology and folklore is so bloody fascinating. Just - anywhere, look <i>anywhere</i> on this here site: <a href="http://www.orkneyjar.com/"><a href="http://www.orkneyjar.com/">http://www.orkneyjar.com/</a></a> <br>There&#39;s a certain old-fairy sort&#39;ve mystique to it all (bit of influence from the Celts and such,) but with an added focus on the wild seas and waters that surround the islands. Lots of selkies and mermaids and such, but it&#39;s the Finfolk that entice me the most - mysterious, nomadic, amphibious sorcerer-types, unparalleled in boating, blamed for various mysterious disappearances. Some rowing silhouette, dark under the moonlight, vaguely human but you <i>know</i> it isn&#39;t. Also:<br><br><img src="http://www.scotlandinfo.eu/images/old-man-of-hoy.jpg" alt="http://www.scotlandinfo.eu/images/old-man-of-hoy.jpg"> <br>The Old Man of Hoy! <br><br><img src="http://www.ancient-wisdom.com/Images/countries/Scottish%20pics/brodgar1.jpg" alt="http://www.ancient-wisdom.com/Images/countries/Scottish%20pics/brodgar1.jpg"> <br>The Ring of Brodgar! <br><br><img src="http://orcadianwildlife.co.uk/wPress/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Puffin-with-sandeel-pic-Sarah-Sankey.jpg" alt="http://orcadianwildlife.co.uk/wPress/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Puffin-with-sandeel-pic-Sarah-Sankey.jpg"> <br>Puffin Island, the legendary Orkney island that is famous for looking <i>exactly</i> like a puffin with a fish in its mouth!<br><br><br>I, er.

            <p>Actually, there area about a billion places I&#39;d love to go in the real world, given the chance. I suppose the top of the list would be Angkor Wat in Cambodia. <br><br>(Side note: If I weren&#39;t an overly excitable twerp I&#39;d&#39;ve found much nicer, smaller images for this, but, as it is, I think they do the place justice. But I&#39;d be lucky to have the patience of a five-year-old, so these&#39;ll just have to do. :P)<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/yzXcAM9.jpg"><br><br>I&#39;m a huge fan of symbolic detail, and so while Rosslyn Chapel is hugely high on that list as well, I was asked to pick a place which, frankly, is a smidge unfair. But I probably made that clear in the title, so, erm. Moving on.<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/RzW8X96.jpg"><br><br>The idea of a city of temples is just immensely appealing to me, and I&#39;m a huge fan of the imagery of the vedas of Hinduism, though I don&#39;t count myself a member of the religion. <br><br>It&#39;s just an interesting place, and not all that commonly mentioned. <br><br>Also--hS! Petra&#39;s a brilliant choice. I&#39;ve been twice, actually, and I can tell you it&#39;s as gorgeous as it seems. While the treasury itself is obviously gated off, in the totally-not-Canyon-of-the-Crescent-Moon valley leading up to it, you&#39;ve got tons of places to crawl around in leading up to it that were also built by the Nabataeans and make use of the same architectural style. <br><br>The colours in the exposed sandstone in the last picture have even more contrast in one of the smaller shrines I found. <br><br>On top of that, the rock formations themselves are beautiful, with weird, Lovecraftian shapes to them that are eerily beautiful. It feels like it&#39;s full of secrets, and it would, strategically, make a lovely place to hide out with enough resources. <br><br>If the walk seems a bit much, there are also people selling carriage, horse, and camel rides, setting up their own small enterprises on-site. <br><br>I&#39;d have to say the most curious thing about the place is the fact that the treasury itself, both times I visited, was surrounded by cats. All over the place. <br><br>So, erm, forgive the travel infomercial, but I just really, really like Petra and I thought you might appreciate more thoughts on the place. </p>

            <p>Aaand remember about as much as you do. :(<br><br>From what I recall, the one I saw was specifically about the fall of Angkor Wat, which came about because of a combination of overconfidence and complexity addiction in the development of their water management system. <br><br>(Historical tangent below:)<br><br>According to the Elgoog the Great and Powerful, the Khmers built a series of reservoirs to prepare for the natural dry season, and connected them to the entire region. They relied on storing and the natural water they usually got in the rainy season with reservoirs to prepare for the dry season. They actually overdid it, changing the water content of soil of the whole region, but most scholars say that wasn&#39;t the cause of what followed.<br><br>What followed, it seems, was one of the biggest droughts Cambodia as a whole has ever seen to this day. <br><br>Given that they&#39;d built their city to prep for a rainy season that never came, the empire eventually had to relocate their nobles, and bureaucratic difficulties ensued. <br><br><br>(Huh. Who&#39;d&#39;ve thought I&#39;d seen the same documentaries as the Kurgan. Small world, this. :P)<br><br></p>

            <p>There are so many places I&#39;d love to go, most of them in the UK.

Not to mention, it&#39;s a pretty building. Apparently the place has been besieged no less than eight times, and it&#39;s also seen a number of monarchs crowned there. So yeah, since Hogwarts is out of the question, I&#39;d like to visit this castle instead. :)</p>

            <p>Alaska is a beautiful state. Some days I look out by back yard, gaze up at the mountains towering above, and I think about just how lucky I am to live here. Though, if it&#39;s the Northern Lights are what you want to see, you&#39;ll have to come for the winter, and a lot of the cool, tourist things to do are closed, on account of three feet of snow and ice accumulation. However, you have far better chances of seeing Denali! And I have to admit, Alaska with a coating of snow on it is just breathtaking.<br><br>Come up! Say hi!

            <p>Every time I think I&#39;m out...<br><br>Anyway, let&#39;s take a look at what we have here.<br><br>1) Are you known in the community?  Yeah, I know your name, at least, and I&#39;m barely considered to be here.<br><br>2) Can you write?  This is a more difficult question.  SPaG is fine, which I would expect given that you have betas, so good there.  However, you have a problem with story-flow.  I think this may be what hS was talking about.  Your characters go from one emotion to be next without passing the intervening space (teleporting emotions?).  <br><br>An example of this would be when Arden goes immediately from sombre and depressed to totally ecstatic because his partner points out the bed that was in full view the whole time.  He could see the bed, but he didn&#39;t react to it until it was pointed out to him, and then it was a sudden full reversal of emotion.  It is all very sudden and gives the impression that each thought and action is totally independent of what came before it.  And I know you mention this in Arden&#39;s bio, but it isn&#39;t limited to just him.  Even if it was, he is incredibly jarring on his own.  You&#39;ll want to work on the flow, going forward.<br><br>3) Your characters.  This is where we run into some big problems.<br><br>Jace &quot;Shiny&quot; Beleran - One of your two characters is (arguably) the main protaganist of the MTG story.  That&#39;s not a particularly encouraging start.  Add to that the fact that Jace is incredibly intelligent and powerful even beyond his mental magic.  That&#39;s part of what being a Planeswalker is: semi-phenomenal, nearly-cosmic power, itty-bitty living space.  This is a man who beat an infinitely-old, eldritch abomination at chess without any magic at all.  He might be the greatest mind in the multiverse.  AND he has powerful magic at his disposal.<br><br>Also, what time period is he supposed to be from?  According to the bio, he just ran afoul of Alhamaret and lost his memory, but that point isn&#39;t depicted on any Jace card that I&#39;m aware of (and I did check).  There&#39;s Vryn&#39;s Prodigy where he is a kid before the Sphinx took him in, and everything else is after he lost his memory and grew up on Ravnica.  And none of the cards have grass in the picture, so that didn&#39;t help pin it down.<br><br>All of this is to say, there are major problems and I&#39;m really not comfortable with this character, at all.<br><br>Arden - Seems fine enough.  I just don&#39;t recall ever reading that Krynn magic is addictive.  Some mages went a little nutty when the power got turned off that one time, but that was because the magic was all they had in their life, and they didn&#39;t know how to cope when they thought it was gone for good.  In the grand scheme, this is a small detail that can be easily adjusted.<br><br><br>So, verdict time.  <b>Permission denied</b>, for a couple of reasons.  <br><br>For one, Jace has to go.  Create a new character that isn&#39;t a near-god-level protagonist in the story they come from.  The idea of a card being transformed into a living being isn&#39;t a bad idea, just stay away from the Planeswalkers and probably the Legendary Creatures as well.  There is still plenty of room to play there.  Maybe the character is a Deputy of Acquittals, or a Goblin Test-pilot, or a Simic Guildmage.  The multiverse is a big place.<br><br>Secondarily, you need to work on the flow of your stories.  The lack of clear progression from point A to point B can be off-putting, and you want your audience to be able to follow along.<br><br>There are good parts of your request so fix these few problems and re-apply.  You are probably not far off.<br><br>-Phobos</p>

            <p>First off, the card I was basing Jace&#39;s character off is &quot;Jace Beleren.&quot; Since that card didn&#39;t have a specific time period attached to it (other than after Alhammaret), I decided to make it right after the fight with Alhammmaret. Also, look the card up on google images; you&#39;ll see that there is grass on a version of that card.<br><br>Additionally, about Krynn magic being addictive; there are a few parts in the books (particularly Legends and War of Souls) where mages say the magic is their love and their life. For example: in War of Souls, the lack of magic basically turned Palin Majere into an addict scrambling for his next fix (i.e. magical artifacts from the Fourth Age that were still imbued with old magic). </p>

            <p>1) Jace was a teenager when he fought Alhammaret.  He is mid-20&#39;s when he first shows up on Lorwyn (where that card came from).  There were years between those two points.<br><br>Also, it looks like he is standing on rocky terrain, so maybe it&#39;s moss?<br><br>2) Palin was tortured, I think that probably has more to do with his state in that series.  They broke his hands and left him useless unless he uses magic, which he can&#39;t get without breaking irreplaceable artifacts.<br><br>The love and life thing is what I was talking about.  They have devoted their whole life to magic, so when it disappears it pretty much takes their their perception of who they are with it.  Some of them got on fine without it, some of them looked for new magics, some of them went a little nuts, some did a combination of those last two.<br><br>-Phobos</p>

Look back at the first sample; I think Shiny and Arden have four different conversations with barely a link between them. And the &quot;suddenly illusion which solves everything&quot; moment is very abrupt.<br><br>I don&#39;t know.

            <p>There&#39;s an agent or two for possible future use who I think would fit well in a non action department, but I&#39;ve never written for that category before, the non-action departments (Well, yes, I did write one Intel report, but you have your work cut out for you there)...

            <p>First off, I want to second (third?) everything hS said.  Very good information, that.<br><br>Secondarily, in general I feel like Non-action Departments offer a more &quot;slice of life&quot; experience.  Very similar to what you might get in an Action Department interlude.  You get to explore the zany happenings of the people who rarely leave HQ, but are just as insane as any assassin or bad-slasher.<br><br>Third and lastly, I highly recommend writing a Non-action Department if you want a change of pace from missions.

            <p>If you write for the Cafeteria, you&#39;re basically writing a barkeeper who hears all the gossip. If you write Building Maintenance, you get to write a fractious team who&#39;re repairing the damage everyone else does. If you write Finance, you&#39;re going into badfics to pilfer technology (<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SRNcbTohGUfKBaibOKAi2aAC0ofdbm_wQPKIsFksVJs/pub">see here</a>). In Personnel, you might end up writing a liason with other pro-canon organisations...<br><br>The Infrastructure Departments are far more varied than the Action Departments. They range from the DIA dragging insane agents to FicPsych, to FicPsych treating said agents, to something DoDAEG who have <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TjFsuVhzR_iPwxw_sxLz9LjuDF6ylRbA6FrXMI-EVrw/pub">their own problems</a>.<br><br>One thing you might want to keep in mind is that a lot of the Infrastructure Departments are the &#39;responsibility&#39; (for want of a better word) of one person. It would be quite rude to write FicPsych without talking to Neshomeh first, for instance - for one thing, she <i>knows</i> a lot more about it than anyone else! She&#39;s also put a lot of work in over there. So if you have a department/division in mind, naming it so whoever&#39;s hovering over it can offer advice is a good idea.<br><br>hS</p>

In-universe, it&#39;s all taking place in a large holodeck - your agents will suffer, but take no lasting harm.<br><br>Last time I said Permission was required; this time I think we can dispense with that requirement, despite the broadcast being canonical. Consider it a weird sort of cowrite.<br><br>We&#39;ve traditionally had pre-Games interviews with the tributes (just a quick spiel from them about why they&#39;re here), which are helpful for the host to get them in character; this would be a good time to write those, too.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>That is, C and Lu do. Well, okay, Steele drugged them and forced them into it. She has since completely revised her appearance. (For once, she does not look completely unusual. She disapproves of looking like a normal human.)<br><br>How should I do the interviews?<br><br>Oh. I should maybe mention Lu&#39;s... physical quirks.<br><br>She is seven feet tall with a prehensile tail which serves as a five-and-three-fourths-foot bludgeon. Her tongue is similarly prehensile, and able to extend maybe a foot out of her mouth. She also has three-inch claws instead of fingernails, natural armor on her arms, and a scaled lower body. Lu happens to be very, very, <i>very</i> good with a halberd.<br><br>On the other hand, it&#39;s not so easy for her to move quickly without her specially-made heels (about three inches high, but with a very specific shape). So without those, she&#39;s a lot less effective at staying alive. Feel free to deprive her of these at least once.<br><br>Let me know if there was anything else you needed from me!</p>

            <p>I think I&#39;ll give my regular cast a break this time, but for lulz, I&#39;ll throw in Shimon and Caprice, who are respectively a male Nosgothic vampire of the Razielim clan and a female 20-something human of the pretty-average clan. If you have no idea who the heck these people are, that&#39;s because they&#39;ve only appeared in <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=303092;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">this prompt piece</a>, which I wrote <s>on a dare</s> as a challenge and posted anonymously to see what would happen. {= )<br><br>(Yeah, I&#39;m pretty sure I wouldn&#39;t get away with a stunt like that these days...)<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Apollo: &quot;Again? Yeah, this was fun last year. Want to try and last longer obviously, but Kelly, Theo, Kaatah and I are holding our own small competition to see who can kill the most as well. I&#39;d die early if it meant I won that.

Me? I just want to support other people and win.<br><br>Theo: &quot;Now this should be introduced to the Mandalorians! Not as much fun as the Grand Hunt I&#39;d wager, but it&#39;s still going to be a lot of fun. I imagine even Torian would love this. It reminds me of the time when Blizz, Mako and I had to fight in an arena on Hoth for these pirates. THAT was fun, never fried someone with my flamethrower whilst encasing them in carbonite before that. You NEED to try it.&quot; <br><br>Kaatah: &quot;I don&#39;t actually remember volunteering, but there we go. I was probably Theo who did it for me. Not that I mind, I mean so long as my suit doesn&#39;t puncture, or I have to survive on what you humans call &#39;normal&#39; food, or I have to handle anything that isn&#39;t a clean environment... Quarians weren&#39;t built for this. Krogans would call this fun... I wonder what would happen if the Krogan and the Mandalorians met...&quot;</p>

            <p>I&#39;ll host if no-one else wants to, but if someone does, go for it! I know I had a lot of fun, and I&#39;m sure Sergio and Iximaz did for #3 and #2.

            <p>Here&#39;s the stuff I&#39;ve noticed:<br><br><b>Littlefoot isn&#39;t a dinosaur any more</b><br><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/Ornithoscelida.png"><br><br>At least, not according to a new paper printed in <i>Nature</i> (<a href="https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/tetrapod-zoology/ornithoscelida-rises-a-new-family-tree-for-dinosaurs/">TetZoo article, because &#39;Nature&#39; is paywalled</a>), which claims to make therapods (ie carnivorous bipedal dinosaurs) closer to ornithischians (ie smallish plant eaters) than to sauropods (ie long-necks). The trouble with that is that the two definitions of <i>Dinosauria</i> are:<br><br>&quot;The last common ancestor of <i>Triceratops</i> and the common sparrow and its descendents.&quot;<br><br>&quot;The last common ancestor of the original three dinosaurs (<i>Megalosaurus, Iguanodon, Hylaeosaurus</i>) and its descendants.&quot;<br><br>... neither of which includes sauropods under the new system! So Littlefoot is just a very large reptile. ^_^<br><br>(Okay, to be fair, the new paper proposed a new definition using the last ancestor of <i>Triceratops</i>, the sparrow, and <i>Diplodocus</i>, which loops him back in. But you&#39;ve got to admit it&#39;s funnier this way.)<br><br><b>Croc-faced T. rex is back</b><br><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/TyrantCroc.png"><br><br>A new report <a href="http://www.nature.com/articles/srep44942">also in &#39;Nature&#39;</a> (but not paywalled this time) demonstrates that a close relative of <i>T. rex</i> had crocodile-like facial scales, not the bare skin or feathers some had assumed. The news article I read last night pointed out that the sensitivity of these scales could mean they were used in mating behaviour - so yeah, tyrannosaur makeouts.<br><br>(They still probably had feathered bodies, though.)<br><br>(<a href="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2017/03/tyrannosaur-face-touch-dinosaurs-evolution-science/">Natural Geographic</a> article on the subject.)<br><br><b>There and Back Again... Twice!</b><br><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/SpaceX.png"><br><br>This unprepossessing sight is a SpaceX Falcon 9 first-stage booster, sitting pretty on the barge <i>Of Course I Still Love You</i>, having landed after boosting a satellite up to space. Not that special, SpaceX has pulled that trick off before - but that&#39;s the thing: so has <i>this booster</i>.<br><br>Yes, this is the refurbished, reloaded, and relaunched first-stage booster from the <i>first</i> successful barge landing. It&#39;s been launched not once, but twice - and has been successfully recovered both times. And that, I think you&#39;ll agree, is pretty spectacular.<br><br><a href="http://gizmodo.com/watch-spacex-launch-a-re-used-rocket-into-space-for-the-1793863163">You can watch the launch video here</a>.<br><br>That&#39;s what&#39;s penetrated through to my awareness, but I&#39;m certain there&#39;s more science news out there. Throw it out here if you&#39;ve got it, folks.<br><br>hS</p>
