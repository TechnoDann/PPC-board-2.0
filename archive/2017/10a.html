<li>Lotte being all concerned about Ix is cute<br>- Shame about the hair<br>- Nice of Charlotte to go get the brace. Shame that&#39;s about to get nurfed into the ground<br>- re: thirst, Ix&#39;s gift for understatement again?<br>- Extra comma in <tt>“Just so long as you promise to eat some, yourself,”</tt>?<br>- I like the snuggling scene<br>- That was a nice bit of tension, where Ix started going for the human blood<br>- I like the description of the disguise shift, though I do want to know how Charlotte pronounced the exclamation mark in &#39;vampire!me&#39;<br>- &quot;I always did tell you you were hot&quot;... . That was a funny line<br>- Ix has a lot of good points about the morph there<br>- &quot;You have a promising career as a chinrest.&quot; was also a funny line<br>- &quot;If you die out there, I&#39;ll kill you&quot;<br>- I like Ix&#39;s solution. It seems like the right response to this sort of thing.<br>  - <del>inb4 the Flowers hassle them about postmortem charging</del><br>- (agent!}Ix, you don&#39;t need to apologize for everything. (referring to Ix&#39;s reaction to Charlotte&#39;s reaction to the execution method)<br>- &quot;lept off the sofa like she&#39;d been tasered&quot; is good description<br>- The ending is nice, in general<br><br>Review, broadly:<br>Was good. What I personally liked the best were the Charlotte/Ix relationship parts. The balance between that sort of thing and fic-missioning was reasonable.<br><br>Sudden thought: will Charlotte go into an Andalite-style food craze post morph?<br><br>- Tomash</li>

            <p>It was a fun read, though some of it really made me think: what happens when Charlotte has to realize that she isn&#39;t going to be invincible as a human? What happens when she rushes in and gets torn apart and <i>doesn&#39;t come back</i>? Because she&#39;s got into some <i>seriously</i> bad habits when it comes to Suvian takedown tactics, and it&#39;s frankly worrying that Ix hasn&#39;t brought her up on it even once.</p>

            <p>We know from <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pHfubKjf6k9l9MZAfFpacN9pjtnxkhI96C1AqUNBIL4/pub">&quot;Ephemerals&quot;</a> that the current head of DCUP, the Sadistic Bladderwrack, was once head of the Department of Clichéd Humor.  To directly quote Huinesoron&#39;s &quot;Head of Department&quot; entry for the DCH: &quot;The Bladderwrack, who had not yet become Sadistic. After the department collapsed, it spent six miserable years doing odd jobs for the other Flowers in an effort to persuade them to give it another chance, before finally starting the DCUP.&quot;<br><br>So I basically see it fully as motivation on the Bladderwrack&#39;s part.  Its previous department, where the agents constantly exemplified humor, was taken apart.  It worked hard to finally become head of agent teams again, so this time, it made sure to make the agents behave oppositely, focusing on punishment rather than jokes.<br><br>So do the DCUP agents <i>need</i> to come up with ridiculous punishments?  Not really; the Bladderwrack is the only one who cares.  Heck, in the <a href="https://archive.is/20131016061337/ppcpunishment.webs.com/badfic2.htm">second DCUP mission</a> ever published, the punchline at the end is that the agents give up on being creative and nuke the entire fic.  It&#39;s not that they&#39;re actually trying to be different from other departments&#39; teams; they&#39;re just giving their annoying boss what it thinks higher-ranking Flowers expect of his division.<br><br>—doctorlit, unusual but not cool</p>

            <p>But that doesn&#39;t mean anybody else needs to. {= ) To quote DCUP&#39;s main page:<br><br>&quot;[DCUP&#39;s] would-be trademark is an overactive imagination when it comes to slaying time, although if you actually think about it, all of HQ could really make that claim.<br><br>&quot;The only person who really takes DCUP seriously is its founder, Scorpia Lotus, who had never heard of TV Tropes when he chose its name and thus thought he was being terribly clever and original. Scorpia started life as a Marty-Stu. This might explain a lot.&quot;<br><br>So no, there&#39;s definitely no actual need to treat the Duty in DCUP any differently than you&#39;d treat any other Floaters mission, except for the agents complaining about the eccentricities of their boss and forebear. It should, however, probably be an incentive for you, the hypothetical DCUP writer, to push yourself to come up with ideas that haven&#39;t been done before, or at least really strive for poetic justice and humor.<br><br>(I would also speculate that the original agents caught hell for nuking that songfic and that&#39;s why we haven&#39;t heard from them again, but that is 100% speculation on my part.)<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>... there was a bout of &#39;agent and Flower team up to make a department&#39; in 2004. That&#39;s <i>exactly</i> how DOGA was formed, and I wouldn&#39;t put it past Maly and the Elanor to have done the same thing for the DOOCH.<br><br>In those departments, the personality of the founding agent plays a major role in defining the department&#39;s MO. The Pyro Department took its lead from Dafydd; the DCUP&#39;s inventiveness is from Scorpia; the DOOCH is pointless and hugs things because of Maly. How well that inspiration sticks probably depends on the recruits [/the later writers]: DOGA has kept &#39;destroy&#39; but without holding onto &#39;burn&#39;, but DOOCH seems to be maintaining its &#39;hug a hobbit today&#39; outlook.<br><br>I take two things away from this:<br><br>-I clearly need an &#39;Ephemerals&#39; follow-up focussing on this phenomenon.<br><br>-I badly need to update the DOOCH page.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I realised today that John Hurt&#39;s death back in January deprived us of the chance of seeing the most amazing <i>Doctor Who</i> film ever: a Time War movie starring him, Derek Jacobi as the Master, and Timothy Dalton as Rassilon.<br><br>So I decided to make all of you miserable by imagining what might have been:<br><br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/dNgT8L1.png"><br><br>The film starts with the War Doctor (John Hurt) hunting for the War Master (Derek Jacobi). The High Council of the Time Lords wants to resurrect Rassilon; Lady President Romana (Lalla Ward if she&#39;s interested; <a href="http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Juliet_Landau">Juliet Landau</a> is also a possibility) thinks that&#39;s dumb, and has tasked the Doctor with finding another plan. The Doctor wants to resurrect Davros instead (it&#39;s a <i>Time</i> War, no-one stays dead), and needs the Master&#39;s help.<br><br>It doesn&#39;t work. Instead, the Master imbues himself with energy from the Eye of Harmony, at the same time claiming the mantle of Omega, the <i>other</i> legendary founder of the Time Lords. And having Omega stomping around again is enough to shake Rassilon from his tomb. He takes the body the current Castellan (Timothy Dalton) and returns to the Citadel of the Time Lords.<br><br>Romana refuses to hand over the Sash, Crown, and Rod of Rassilon. It&#39;s unclear at this point whether Rassilon is truly returned, or whether the Castellan just has his power (like the Master does Omega&#39;s), but the Council don&#39;t particularly care - they see his power, and want him to rule.<br><br>As the debate rages, the Master descends on the Citadel. He greets Rassilon as if he was Omega, and the Council are delighted - but neither of them trusts the other. At the first opportunity, they betray one another - and as it happens, that opportunity is the Doctor breaking into the Citadel and trying to shoot Rassilon in the face.<br><br>As the Time War continues to rage (appearances by the War Council, yes please!), <i>civil</i> war breaks out in the Citadel. Romana, Rassilon, and the Master each end up with their own factions, each seeking their own goals. As the war goes on, Rassilon creates the De-mat gun and uses it to create his gauntlet; the Master deploys all manner of horrors from the depths of the Time Lord vaults; and the Doctor hunts for the <i>third</i> founder of Gallifrey - the mysterious Other, whose name isn&#39;t even know. Is (s)he still alive? Did (s)he even exist?<br><br>The outcome is actually the least exciting part of the film, because we already know it: the Master flees to the end of time, wiping the Doctor&#39;s memory of his face along the way. Rassilon secures his rule of Gallifrey. And the Doctor finds that the Other&#39;s power has been bound up in a tool, or a weapon, a small, simple box... something known as the Moment.<br><br>Part of the fun is that this is a <i>Time</i> War. The timeline of the film twists and turns: we see Rassilon, the Master, and the Doctor facing off before we ever see Rassilon resurrected. The designers get to let their imaginations run wild when coming up with temporal weapons for both sides to use.<br><br>Along the way, we make use of the threefold nature of our primary cast. The three Founders correlate directly to the three protagonists (the Doctor is said in non-TV stories to be the reincarnation of the Other), but there are also three ancient Gallifreyan gods at play: Pain, Death, and Time line up nicely with the Master (who&#39;s crazy), Rassilon (who will just straight-up kill you), and the Doctor (who wants to change history). They also fit the stories of the Founders, at least as depicted here.<br><br>Obviously this isn&#39;t a perfect outline - it probably needs a twist somewhere in the third act, to avoid the inevitable march towards <i>Utopia/The End of Time/The Day of the Doctor</i>. But it&#39;s enough to make me sad that we can never see it.<br><br>And hopefully you too. ;)<br><br>hS<br><br>(PS: I know I&#39;m only doing Friday Forum every other week or so. Maybe if the news would stop being so depressing I&#39;d do it every week.)</p>

            <p>The Castellan /is not/ Rassilon; he&#39;s just pretending. He doesn&#39;t even have his power, like the Master does Omega&#39;s - that&#39;s why he needs to make the De-mat Gauntlet.<br><br>For the finale, our trio come face to face with the shades of the three Founders. Rassilon steals the Castellan&#39;s form, turning the lie into truth. Omega steals his own power back from the Master. And the Other simply whispers something in the Doctor&#39;s ear, and points towards the Omega Arsenal.<br><br>If Romana is still around to ask, the Doctor can tell her what he&#39;s doing: &#39;It&#39;s time to sieze the moment.&#39;<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve noticed lately that there seems to be a subgenre of what I have to call generational historical fiction. This is where a book or series of books doesn&#39;t follow one character, but a family line across a long swathe of history.<br><br>The first example that comes to my mind is Rosemary Sutcliffe&#39;s Eagle of the Ninth saga, which runs from the height of Roman Britain to the Norman Conquest. Thd family with the dolphin ring (another thing: there&#39;s quite often an heirloom passed down the family, to maintain the narrative thread) is fairly common, but they make a great window on British life pre-conquest. <br><br>There&#39;s also Steven Saylor&#39;s Roma and Empire, which run from before the founding of Rome to the reign of Emperor Hadrian. That also has a piece of jewellery, and sticks with the same family; it does bring its protagonists rather closer to greatness, though (they hang out with basically every Emperor).<br><br>But I don&#39;t know how big this sub-genre is. In particular, I&#39;d love to know if it exists for history outside western Europe. If someone&#39;s done this for, say, China, or one of the African nations, it would be a fantastic way for me to fill some of the gaps in my feel for history.<br><br>Does anyone have other examples? I think Stephen Baxter&#39;s Time&#39;s Tapestry also counts, running pretty continuously from the Roman invasion of Britain to Columbus&#39; journey - though it is a bit more sci-fi-ish, with the &#39;heirlooms&#39; being messages from the future. I can&#39;t count something like his Northland trilogy, because it only shows three widely-separated generations, not the slow progression.<br><br>Anyone?<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Rather than following one family, it follows several intertwining ones through WWI, WWII, and the Cold War/Civil Rights era. All European and American, but with some good attention paid to women, gay people, and black people.

            <p>Non-fiction, though--a sort of creative autobiography mixed with family history, IIRC. It&#39;s called The Hare With Amber Eyes (I&#39;ve forgotten the author&#39;s name). It uses a particular type of Japanese figurine (the name of which I have also unfortunately forgotten) as a thread in a family story that stretches from Europe to Japan and I think America too? It does include Western Europe, IIRC, but it&#39;s really not the typical story, and it&#39;s not following a white family. It stretches across several centuries, at any rate, including both the author and his ancestors.<br><br>I don&#39;t remember being *that* caught by it--among other things, the print in my copy was really small--so I didn&#39;t finish it, but the story itself was interesting and I know my mom (who&#39;s much more into non-fiction and autobiographies than I am) read it and liked it. I think she said it picked up a bit after the beginning, though.<br><br>Anyway. Not straight historical fiction, but certainly interesting, and it does otherwise fit that subgenre you&#39;re talking about. At any rate, it was the first thing I thought of.<br><br>~Z</p>

            <p>is the <i>North and South</i> trilogy by John Jakes.  It presents the U.S. Civil War period through the eyes of two separate families from Pennsylvania and South Carolina, reaching from the decade of unrest that led to the war to the reconstruction period long after.  The focal characters of each family are sons of roughly the same age, who meet while attending West Point and become friends, only to end up fighting against each other during the war.<br><br>It&#39;s not exactly a fee-good story, and for me, it had rather too much sex in it.  The last book felt like it went a bit off the deep end compared to the earlier two, and some of the supporting characters dive a bit too far into the realm of strawmen as well, Overall, though, I think it gives a much better feel for the place and time than any history textbook I ever encountered could manage.<br><br>—doctorlit</p>

            <p>...Because look at Foundation: It has a lot of aspects that you&#39;re discussing: an heirloom (The Seldon Plan and the videos) as a common thread, following a common line across a wide swath of history (but now the common line is a civilization).

            <p>It&#39;s bad to say that I&#39;ve never really liked his writing, isn&#39;t it? :( But I haven&#39;t.<br><br>I think this genre is actually more common in fantasy/scifi than realistic fiction. Being able to explore the progression of your ideas beyond one lifetime is a big deal - heck, even Tolkien did it, if you think of <i>The Hobbit</i> and <i>LotR</i> as a series. (And of course 40K has taken it to the ultimate extreme, with &#39;here&#39;s two series set ten millennia apart&#39;.)<br><br>Sadly, it&#39;s specifically the ability to learn about real history that I&#39;m interested in with this.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Yeah, makes sense. As does your distaste for Asimov: it&#39;s not for everyone, especially not Foundation, which is an interesting series, but has quite a few problems as a story - well, the trilogy does, because that&#39;s what I read.<br><br>But as for historical fiction... well, the only thing I can think of is Stephenson, with Baroque/Cryptonomicon, but 1) that has a massive timeskip, and 2) it includes one character who is actually immortal.

            <p>I mean, I create OCs who are in relationships with each other (I have nothing against canon-x-OCs that are done right, and indeed there are some fandoms such as Frozen where there are only one or two actually good ships that are canon-x-canon, but I don&#39;t really create OCs to ship with canons myself), but as for canon-x-canons, I don&#39;t really do much shipping. I do endorse canon ships, but you&#39;ll more likely find me tearing apart bad ships than creating good ones. (Again, most Frozen ships.) So yeah, that&#39;s my take on shipping.<br><br>-Twistey</p>

            <p>I ship some characters, and others I will read at least sometimes. There does need to be a canon chemistry and for slash not an explicit abhorrence of same sex relationships. A lot of the potential ships in canons I follow are problematic because of inherent power differentials. If one character has the power to fire the other or reprimand the other in their work, then that is problematic.<br><br>For an old example: Stargate SG-1. Jack and Sam are the most obvious and popular pairing. They have intense chemistry and clearly have feelings for each other. The problem is that they are both military and he outranks her with her as his direct subordinate. In canon, Jack 100% respects that, and why wouldn&#39;t he? He&#39;s lifetime military. Sam seems more frustrated by it than Jack does, but she&#39;s younger and she does still clearly accept the reality. Getting them together, for me, has to involve getting one or both out of the military.<br><br>Then you have the other main ship of the fandom, Jack and Daniel Jackson. Daniel is not military. Jack is the leader of the team, but never really had full power over Daniel. The two of them wanting to be together, power wise, is only really hampered by DADT.<br><br>My personal favorite ship is Duke Crocker/Nathan Wuornos in Haven, with Duke/Nathan/Audrey as a close back up, depending on when during canon the story is set. That&#39;s a canon I love, but despise the way the last two seasons went, so often pretend they didn&#39;t happen with AU fics. <br><br>As for why those two? Duke and Nathan have a vaguely detailed past relationship that had ended incredibly badly in their late teens or early twenties and then been apart for at least a decade then were back in proximity again a couple years before the show started. I always believed you couldn&#39;t possibly be that angry at another person, but still willing to drop everything and be kind when that person is hurt if there wasn&#39;t love behind it. They behaved exactly like a couple that had had a messy break up, but still had feelings for each other. The actors were also constantly fanning those flames. One of them was even known to retweet slashy fanart with positive remarks.</p>

            <p>Mostly I&#39;m content to accept the canon ships or lack thereof. There are some that I&#39;ve cheered on more than others (Roslin/Adama springs to mind), and some I haven&#39;t cared for (the whole love triangle in <i>The Hunger Games</i>, Buffy/pretty much any of her LIs), but it&#39;s not something I get really worked up about. Probably because it&#39;s not something I&#39;ve ever been really worked up about in real life, either. Throughout middle school, high school, and college, I had a total of three boyfriends and was only really interested in kissing (let alone doing anything else with) the last one, whom I went on to marry. So yeah. I&#39;m hanging out somewhere on the lower lefthand side of that bell curve. {= )<br><br>I&#39;ve never had strong enough feelings about a canon/canon ship that I wanted to write about it myself. I used to have some negative feelings about shipping in other people&#39;s fanfic, mostly to the tune of either &quot;ew, they wouldn&#39;t do that!&quot; or &quot;ugh, can we please focus on something more interesting?&quot;, but nowadays I&#39;ll read other people&#39;s ships with characters I like, and as long as it&#39;s well-written and has a reasonable basis on the characters&#39; personalities, I can get into it. Canon/canon, canon/OC, straight, gay, whatever.<br><br>As for shipping my own characters, I&#39;ve typically had a bit of an aversion to it <i>unless</i> in an RP scenario, with someone else playing the other character in the relationship. Firstly I wasn&#39;t interested, secondly it felt like cheating, and thirdly it&#39;s just really satisfying to get someone else to like your character enough to imagine that their character would want to be with them. I still prefer hooking up my characters with other people&#39;s characters, but if you&#39;ve been watching my writing lately, you may have noticed I&#39;m sometimes willing to ship my characters with each other, too. {= ) Also, I&#39;m writing an OC in a relationship with a canon character in my <i>Skyrim</i> fic, which I think works for me because it&#39;s something you can do as part of the game, so it feels legitimized in sort of the same way an RP ship does in that it came about organically during gameplay, not just because I up and decided it. Everything is better with consent!<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>&quot;Ship&quot; simply stems from &quot;relationship,&quot; though, so I don&#39;t see why it can&#39;t apply to all sorts. &quot;[Canon character]/OC&quot; is definitely a pairing you see on fanfiction sites.

            <p>I have always seen shipping, as it relates to writing, as a construct of fandom.  Outside of the realm of fandom, I see it as not really existing.  In an original work, it is more or less just romance or plot development, or what have you.<br><br>So to answer your question, I do not think that qualifies as shipping, because as far as I can tell it is an original work.  As far as PWP, if it is tied to an existing work, i.e., fanfiction or a response to someone else&#39;s work, I think under the most generous (and common) definition it would be shipping.  If it is not tied to an exiting fandom, then I do not think it counts as shipping.<br><br>________________________________________________________<br><br>Alternatively, shipping refers to the transportation of goods, usually via sea-faring vessel.  </p>

            <p>Or failing that, ships where the subtext is heavy enough you can&#39;t help but consider them as canon, even when no confirmation is given by WoG or anything (Subaru and Teana in Nanoha, Sayaka and Kyoko in Madoka, Sunset Shimmer and Sci-Twi in Equestria Girls, Lyra and Bon Bon in Friendship is Magic...

            <p>I devour it because I&#39;m way more interested in how the characters interact than in the fic&#39;s inherent minutiae-friendliness. Fanfic of any kind asks questions about the media from which it derives, and shipfic in particular can ask some really fascinating ones about the characters they&#39;re shipping, and also about the ones they&#39;re not. Not all of them do, obviously - we wouldn&#39;t have DBS agents if they did - but it&#39;s still not something that should be discarded out of hand. At least, that&#39;s my view. =]</p>

            <p>Though I&#39;d also say that it can be a springboard for interrogating the broader themes of the original work. For instance, if anyone can point me in the direction of <i>Ender&#39;s Game</i> slash or a slow-burn romantic flower shop AU of anything by Heinlein, those&#39;d be interesting to read. I just think there&#39;s so much potential for fanfiction to be used as criticism in the manner of old musical criticism - rather than a Baroque criticism of Monteverdi or whatever, we can have a slashfic or AUfic critique of modern popular media. It&#39;s the democratization of literary theory, of really <i>thinking about</i> what we consume rather than unquestioning canon-minutia memorization.</p>

            <p>Gondorian monumental architecture grew directly out of Numenorean funerary architecture. The early Numenoreans were at peace with the fact that they were going to die (Elros Tar-Minyatur laid down his life willingly, rather than dying of natural causes, though whether that&#39;s suicide or an act of will is unmentioned); their descendents were not, and they began to build grand tombs - Houses of the Dead, in later Gondorian parlance - to pretend that the dead were coming back.<br><br>And of course, if the <i>dead</i> deserve fancy houses, so do the living, right...? Annuminas in Arnor was probably built in the same grand style, so it&#39;s not <i>just</i> Gondor.<br><br>The other drivers in (above-ground) city-building in Middle-earth are 1) fortresses (Minas Ithil to an extent, Ost-in-Edhil, Barad Eithel), and 2) the very specific &#39;looks like Tirion-on-Tuna&#39; (Gondolin, and honestly most of what you think of when you imagine an Elven city). Other than that, people were happy to live in smaller communities and/or underground.<br><br>None of which you can get by reading <i>A Scholarly Guide to Gondorian Architecture</i>, because it doesn&#39;t exist. You have to pick it up by reading the <i>books</i>, and unless you read them in detail you can&#39;t know for sure that you&#39;ve got everything. It&#39;s not like being a chemist, where you can plug &#39;organometallic silver&#39; into a journal and get only what&#39;s related to your field; you have to study everything, or you might miss what matters.<br><br>I suppose if you intended to make a <i>career</i> our of elf-sex criticism stories, then you could focus what you <i>re</i>read... but who does that? Most people write a broad range of stories, and for that, you need to know as much as you can.<br><br>~<br><br>As to your struck-out sidenote: there <i>is</i> an inherent bias to storytelling in Mormonism, simply because the Book of Mormon has a far more coherent narrative and better worldbuilding than the Bible (^<em>~). But I think it&#39;s more of an observer effect: you <i>don&#39;t</i> flag up how many SF/F writers are Catholic, or Baptist, or Pentecostal, because it doesn&#39;t come up in discussion of them. The cultural perception of the LDS Church is closer to how people think about Islam, or the Amish - a distinctly <i>other</i> religion. So they stand out.<br><br>Glancing through &lt;a href=&quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LDS">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LDS</a></em>fiction&quot;&gt;LDS fiction</a>, which is apparently a real Wikipedia article, the only names that pop out of the Notable section for me are Steph, Orson, Brandon Sanderson (Mistborn), Chris Heimerdinger (Mormon YA books), and Glenn Beck (who... is a fiction author apparently?). I&#39;ve read the first three, and while Brother Orson has recently(?) shown himself to be a pretty bad <i>person</i>, the only one whose work I would describe as unambiguously bad is Stephanie Meyer. Which is essentially because she&#39;s trying to write romance novels but without the titillation.<br><br>(I always feel bad for calling Steph&#39;s writing bad, because she clearly cares <i>so much</i>. But she&#39;s also one of those people who drives her characters through to her predetermined ending regardless of whether they would actually act that way - and she has frankly dangerous ideas of what&#39;s romantic.)<br><br>hS, words words words</p>

            <p>OSC isn&#39;t the greatest writer in the world, but I agree with hS here - he may be a bad <i>person</i>, but he&#39;s not a bad writer. Well, he&#39;s not an awful writer, anyways. <i>Ender&#39;s Game</i> is the only novel of his that I&#39;d really recommend with no provisions.

            <p>So I am basically the opposite of Thoth.

            <p>There&#39;s a lot of potential relationships going around in the current Magic story.  Some of them are more likely than others.  Sometimes by a lot.  Let&#39;s take a look.  (This is going to be a long one, folks.)<br><br><b>Chandra/Liliana</b>: The card that was brought up to support this ship is Diabolic Tutor from the set &quot;Kaladesh&quot;:<br><br><img src="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?multiverseid=417648&amp;type=card"><br><br>That&#39;s some great art right there, and it definitely says something.  I could see that being fuel for a ship.  If you read the story, you actually find that Liliana is like Chandra&#39;s cool older cousin or maybe her shoulder!Devil; pushing her to play by her own rules and be the most free version of herself.  That picture is followed immediately by them going out dancing, drinking, and punching city guards in the face.  It was a good time.<br><br>However, their good times were short lived.  By the time &quot;Aether Revolt&quot; rolled around (three months later) they were barely interacting at all.  &quot;Amonkhet&quot;, again, saw little to no interaction between these two.  I&#39;m really not sure what story you are talking about, but I think you might have mistaken Liliana for Nissa, who does interact with Chandra quite a bit.<br><br><b>Phobos&#39;s Rating</b>: Fun but unlikely<br><br><b>Chandra/Nissa</b>:  During the events of &quot;Oath Of The Gatewatch&quot; Chandra and Nissa became close.  Not in any traditional shipping sense, though.  Their minds touched while they poured all of their magic into killing what amounted to two Elder Gods.  For one brief moment, Chandra felt the calm of Nissa&#39;s mind.  This was new and different for Chandra who, being the exemplar of Red magic, is basically ADHD-made-flesh.  It had a profound effect on her.<br><br>Fast forward to the beginning of &quot;Kaladesh&quot;; Chandra is screwing up everything.  She can&#39;t seem to do anything right because she is so hasty.  What is she supposed to do?  Then she thinks back on that moment and it occurs to her that Nissa could help her find that inner calm, again.  So she seeks her out in the garden (Nissa is the Green mage, so that is where she basically lives).  There is a brief conversation that...well...it goes poorly.  See, Chandra is stuck in her own head thinking about how she must be screwing this up, too.  At the same time, Nissa doesn&#39;t understand how to people.  She&#39;s a hermit who talks to plants, animals, and anthropomorphic personifications of whole planets.  So, Chandra starts trying to explain what she wants in a wild, meandering way that ends with her running out and Nissa, who hasn&#39;t really said a word at this point, wondering what she did wrong.<br><br>When Chandra eventually runs off to Kaladesh with Liliana (for the aforementioned drinking and guard punching) Nissa volunteers to go after them and bring them back.  It is her hope that she can atone for whatever mistake she made in that earlier conversation.  When she does catch up to them, she joins Chandra in a quest to find her mom, while Liliana goes off on her own.<br><br>Through the end of &quot;Kaladesh&quot; and &quot;Aether Revolt&quot;, Nissa is the one who has Chandra&#39;s back when things get bad.  When Chandra&#39;s power is running out of control and she is on the fast track to going supernova, it is Nissa that steps in to help her focus and regain control.  And in the end, there is this scene:<br><br><i><blockquote>Nissa swallowed past the desert in her throat. &quot;I don&#39;t speak often. I lived alone for...decades. Zendikar was my companion. We understood each other at a level deeper than words. I...I don&#39;t know how to talk to you. I&#39;m trying to learn.&quot;<br><br>Chandra looked up, eyes wide and startled. &quot;You don&#39;t know how to talk to me?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I will make mistakes,&quot; Nissa said. &quot;Pick the wrong words. Misunderstand yours. I&#39;ll act strange and won&#39;t know that I am. But if you can be patient with me, I would like to be...&quot; Waves of sky-song memory welled upward, symphonies of color and warmth, resonant movement and shared breath. She stilled them, reduced them, and forced out angular words shaped in a pallid shadow of acceptable truth. &quot;...your friend.&quot;</blockquote></i><br><br>Which is followed shortly by this:<br><br><i><blockquote>Carefully, Nissa lifted Chandra&#39;s radiant featherweight, and maneuvered so she could rest her head across her lap. Chandra stirred in her sleep, turning on to her side and curling up, pulling her knees to her chest and her hands to her face. Then her lips parted, and industrial snores pealed across the platform.<br><br>[...]<br><br>Nissa guarded Chandra&#39;s sleep.<br><br>It felt right.</blockquote></i><br><br>Their relationship continues to deepen during &quot;Amonkhet&quot; with this exchange:<br><br><blockquote><i>&quot;Thank you for accompanying me this morning, Chandra.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Nowhere else I&#39;d rather be.&quot; Chandra fiddled with the straps on her vambrace, her eyes darting in Nissa&#39;s direction. An involuntary smile flitted across her face—a blush, an inescapable dash of sentiment.<br><br>Nissa scoffed. &quot;I can think of at least twenty places I would rather be than Amonkhet.&quot;<br><br>Chandra&#39;s smile turned plain and she looked down.<br><br>The two sat in semi-silence, comfortable for one and fraught with unspoken words for the other. Nissa took a breath, allowing the churn of the fountain and the cool shade above to her soothe her nerves. Chandra kept her eyes focused on her buckle.<br><br>&quot;I&#39;ve never spent so long in cities before,&quot; Nissa said. &quot;Between Kaladesh and here, I&#39;ve had more than my share of people.&quot;<br><br>&quot;You seem to be getting along fine,&quot; Chandra replied.<br><br>Nissa shook her head. &quot;I have gotten better at hiding my discomfort. Being around others so often is draining.&quot;<br><br>&quot;But not with us, right?&quot;<br><br>The question caught Nissa&#39;s attention. She watched Chandra intently unbuckle and rebuckle the same strap of her vambrace.<br><br>Nissa frowned. Thought over her words. &quot;Yes and no.&quot;<br><br>Fiddling hands paused, while a meandering mind searched for the words to lend shape to unfamiliar feelings.<br><br>&quot;Friendship with all of the Gatewatch is still quite new. I&#39;m still trying to understand what it means to have friends in the first place,&quot; Nissa said.<br><br>Chandra made a small noise and looked out on the plaza, her posture heavy and leaden, her fingers suddenly quite still.<br><br>Nissa continued. &quot;On Zendikar, I was without the company of people for most of my life. The plane was the closest thing to a friend I had. Learning to trust has been . . . slow—and there is still much for me to learn. Understanding and sustaining friendships is daunting when one has never really done it before.&quot;<br><br>Chandra shifted awkwardly. &quot;So . . . friendship?&quot;</i></blockquote>
<br><br>Chandra seems disappointed in how that exchange went, doesn&#39;t she?  But that&#39;s the thing, isn&#39;t it?  Nissa would have no idea that Chandra is disappointed, and Chandra is too nervous to just come out and say anything about it.  There&#39;s an awkward &quot;will they; won&#39;t they&quot; kind of dynamic.  Chandra is definitely crushing, but I don&#39;t think Nissa understands enough to acknowledge it, let alone reciprocate.<br><br><b>Phobos&#39;s Rating</b>: I ship it.<br><br><br>Now, I could go on, believe me.  There&#39;s at least three other relationships to cover beyond these ones.  However, I&#39;ve already spent two days researching and getting my references together and I should have been working on a blog post instead.  If anyone is interested in my analysis of the rest, I can get back to it after this weekend.<br><br>-Phobos</p>

            <p><i>Rockall, Malin, Hebrides. Southwest gale 8 to storm 10, veering west.</i> ~The Shipping Forecast<br><br>I am not, by and large, much of a shipper (except in my PPC characters, who I ship so much with each other that I ended up with family trees), but I do on occasion. I go for things that are <i>compatible</i> with canon, even if they&#39;re not canon themselves - <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10368490/1/The-Horn-and-the-Harp">I have a Susan Pevensie/Maglor story out there</a>, which exemplifies this.<br><br>More recently, I&#39;ve had my eye on femslash, for philosophical reasons: there isn&#39;t much out there, and that lack of representation bugs me. Turns out the reason is that it&#39;s hard to find two women who can <i>be</i> shipped in a canon-friendly manner - there&#39;s nothing viable in the <i>Star Wars</i> films, for instance (Leia/Mothma? But Leia is pretty straight, and this would just smack of &#39;they don&#39;t actively hate each other, so they must be in luuurve&#39;). (Jyn/Rey could work if you could get around them being 30 years apart. But th&#39;ain&#39;t no time travel in Star Wars.)<br><br>I have an in-process Luthien/Galadriel story, which does justify its existence alongside their canonical romances, but in general Tolkien&#39;s lack of women - especially unmarried women - and their lack of character development when they do exist throws things off. I <i>could</i> write steamy Diamond of Long Cleeve/Estella Bolger erotica, but I&#39;d have to make their personalities up from whole cloth, so it wouldn&#39;t really count.<br><br>(Dropping back to the other kinds of ships, I tend to stick with canon in Middle-earth, and I&#39;ve never seen a slash pairing that convinced me, though <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11184632/1/Intransitives">I have written both a gay elf and a lesbian dwarf</a>.)<br><br>Other canons are more viable, mostly because when you have a large enough cast you can write <i>anything</i>. Sticking with the big-name canons, I can&#39;t pass up this opportunity to unveil my new fic: a femslash (as mentioned) tale from the <i>USS Voyager</i>, starring one of those minor characters who nevertheless is developed enough to write:<br><br><font size="5"><a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12683368/1/The-Ill-Fated-Love-Life-of-Tal-Celes">The Ill-Fated Love Life of Tal Celes</a></font>, a romance in 11 chapters (rolling out over the next couple of weeks).<br><br>In summary? I will generally respect the canon (except when the canon is WRONG [/Team Jacob]), am not particularly attached to any specific ships, and will mostly write femslash if anything for philosophical reasons.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I really go against canon. And I will *only* ship if there is canon support. Period. <br><br>That also means no arbitrary orientation-changing: If canon says the characters are straight, then they are straight, unless you can give me a VERY compelling reason for them not to be. Which means I will very rarely write slash... at least for common pairings.<br><br>Well, okay, I never write slash (shut up, that doesn&#39;t count), but if I DID...<br><br>OTOH, if you write a really good slashfic or shipfic that DOESN&#39;T follow these rules, it doesn&#39;t necessarily mean I&#39;ll hate it. It just has to be very well written. I think The Shoebox Project might be an example of that, but I haven&#39;t gotten to the slash part yet, so I dunno.<br><br>There is at least one exception, which is that I might ship something - in an AU, obviously. Shipfics are kind of implied AU to an extent - if it is A) adorable, and B) fits canon reasonably well. Namely, I am a strong proponent of shipping Primarch Vulkan and A relatively (emphasis on relatively) normal Nocturnian girl who has, somehow, caught his attention. I dunno. Maybe she&#39;s really good at blacksmithing. Not as good as he is, obviously, but... good for a mortal.<br><br>I don&#39;t trust myself to write this, so I haven&#39;t worked out the details, but... trust me, it would be adorable!</p>

            <p>As usual, I&#39;ve stated my position poorly. I&#39;ll see if I can do better the second time around.<br><br>Many popular ships are for characters with pre-existing canon relationships. Which can imply orientation, or at least something about that character. People are bi, and people experiment, so it&#39;s often not so much orientation that&#39;s the problem as it is personality in many cases. There are many fics that just outright ignore canon relations, which... breaks things. James would not be getting it on with Sirius as an adult, because James is absolutely in love with Lilly, and would never do that to her.</p>

            <p>Existing relationships and the personality that makes them start and continue are things you can&#39;t quite just toss out the window because it breaks characters. Unless you&#39;re taking the position that the author is Wrong about who some character would/wouldn&#39;t get into a relationship with, which I seem to remember being a fairly common claim among Harry/Hermione shippers back in the day.<br><br>Your example of James/Sirius as adults would need a good deal of explaining before I&#39;d buy it.<br><br>- Tomash</p>

            <p>Original text was found <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-if-Star-Wars-had-been-written-by-J-R-R-Tolkien/answer/Thomas-Doyle-44?srid=SOWi">here</a> on Quora, but I&#39;ll copy it here as well. <br><br><i>Great machines crawled across the snow; and in the midst was a huge walker, great as a forest-tree a hundred feet in length, striding on mighty legs. Long had it been forging in the dark smithies of Kuat, and its hideous head, founded of dura-steel, was adorned with deadly blasters. AT-AT they named it, in memory of the AT-TEs of old. General Veers piloted it, and a legion of storm troopers followed in its train.<br><br>But about the base’s blast door resistance still was stout, and there the hardiest of the Rebels stood at bay. Blaster and laser fire fell thick; AT-STs crashed or blazed suddenly like torches. All before the base on either side of the blast door the ground was choked with wreck and with bodies of the slain; yet still driven as by a madness more and more came up.<br><br>The AT-AT crawled on. Its steel hide no blaster could pierce. Over the hills of slain a hideous shape appeared: a cyborg, tall, cloaked in black. Slowly, trampling the fallen, he strode forth, heeding no longer any blast. He halted and held up a crimson lightsaber. And as he did so a great fear fell on all, defender and foe alike; and the hands of men drooped to their sides, and no blaster sang. For a moment all was still.<br><br>With a lurch the AT-AT sighted on the blast door. It fired. A deep boom rumbled through the base like thunder running in the clouds.<br><br>Then the Cyborg raised his hand and cried aloud in a dreadful voice, speaking in some forgotten tongue words of power and terror to rend both heart and steel.<br><br>Thrice he cried. Thrice the great machine fired. And suddenly upon the last blast the door broke. As if stricken by some blasting spell it burst asunder: there was a flash of searing lightning, and the doors tumbled in riven fragments to the ground. In strode the Lord of the Sith. A great black shape against the snow beyond he loomed up, grown to a vast menace of despair. In strode the Lord of the Sith, and all fled before his face.</i></p>

            <p>[Checks]<br><br>Yep, in the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1S-_UI6DOepgBPkFVKh0ZWFz8RMVU_uKL0jV30sYQ7yk/pub">second NTV broadcast schedule</a>, I put up the listing for <b>Stars War: Utumno Strikes Back</b>:<br><br><i>Following Lukwё’s destruction of the Starkiller, the Great March is finally underway. But can even the mighty Vala Oromё defend the Eldar against the horde of abominable Orcs Melkor has now unleashed?</i><br><br>Rather than &#39;Star Wars written by Tolkien&#39;, it&#39;s &#39;Tolkien written as <i>Star Wars</i>&#39;. And as it happens, the unpublished/incomplete third schedule lists another film in the series:<br><br><u>Stars War: The North Awakens</u><br><br><i>Thousands of years have passed since Lukwё saved the Great March from Melkor&#39;s machinations, but all is not well in the Blessed Realm. Melkor walks free, a dark-haired elf is filled with rage, Lukwё is nowhere to be found... for young Rehtië and Fanë, the adventure is just beginning.</i><br><br>I feel like it would be fun to fill out the rest of the list. The most recent film out would be <b>Stars War: Road One</b>, the tale of Hyinyë, Casa, and their quest to find the hidden road north from Cuivienen to the dreaded Starkiller. Only if they succeed in rescuing Hyinyë&#39;s father and revealing the secret route can Lukwё&#39;s later journey succeed and the Great March begin...<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>The style works surprisingly well--or perhaps unsurprisingly, since it&#39;s an epic storyline. Anyway, it&#39;s...really thrilling to read. :D I like it a lot.<br><br>~Z</p>
