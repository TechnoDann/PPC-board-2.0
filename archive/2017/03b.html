        <div class="post-body">
            <p>As some of you know, I was brutally mauled by plotbunnies a few weeks ago and have been on something of a <i>Skyrim</i> <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12379507/1/A-Friend-in-Deed">writing</a> <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12385505/1/Green-Glass">binge</a> (<a href="http://neshomeh.deviantart.com/art/A-Friend-in-Deed-666142688">alternative</a> <a href="http://neshomeh.deviantart.com/art/Green-Glass-666198959">links</a>). Well, the story that started it all is done at about 16,000 words (~30 pages), and I would like to make sure it doesn&#39;t suck before putting it out to the Internet at large. I haven&#39;t written anything with a plot that wasn&#39;t PPC-related in a long time, so I am feeling a tad insecure. ^_^;<br><br>My ideal beta would be fairly familiar with TES lore, since I&#39;m not, and though I&#39;ve done a fair bit of research, there&#39;s always a chance that I missed something relevant. Failing that, the story takes place on Solstheim after the main quest of the <i>Dragonborn</i> expansion, so familiarity with all that would be helpful. Failing <i>that</i>, if you don&#39;t mind reading a fic in a setting you don&#39;t know, I would be interested to know how approachable the story is to someone who hasn&#39;t played the games. I don&#39;t want to tediously tell fans what they already know, but I also don&#39;t want to leave out the kind of descriptive detail that anyone should expect from a good adventure story. {= )<br><br>I&#39;m not looking for SPaG checks (though that&#39;s always good) so much as feedback about flow, pacing, theme, characterization, fight choreography, etc.: what works, what doesn&#39;t, why, and how it could be better.<br><br>There are spoilers for the <i>Dragonborn</i> main quest and the side quests &quot;Filial Bonds&quot; and &quot;Retaking Thirsk&quot;; also the <i>Skyrim</i> Companions questline. Oh, and the conclusion of the main quest, but it&#39;s not like y&#39;all don&#39;t know the PC wins in the end, right?<br><br>If you didn&#39;t... um... sorry? &gt;.&gt;;<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Hello, and welcome aBoard! For your newbie gift, take this plate of freshly-made SPaGhetti!<br><br>If you haven&#39;t yet read them, may I point you towards <a href="http://plotprotectors.tripod.com/TOS/">the Original Series</a> and <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=18hztHpDehxcfrjaXoFUew1vb0BdZPDAusHxMHzHiCzM">the Constitution</a>? They&#39;re pretty much the only required reading around these parts. Another useful resource you might use is <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/PPC_Wiki&lt;br%20/&gt;">the Wiki</a>; if you have any questions, just look here before asking. We like it when newbies do the research. ;)<br><br>Lastly, have an <a href="https://discord.gg/ASDg9ey">invite</a> to our Discord channel (where the Constitution does still apply).<br><br>(Unfortunately, I buy all my D&amp;D books as hardbound from Amazon, so I&#39;m not much help here.)<br><br>Hope you stick around for a while!</p>

            <p>Ive already read most of that stuff on the ppc wiki. I&#39;m just reading all the stuff in the fr biblio from candlekeep. The ebooks are available on kindle so no worries there, but i&#39;m interested int he sourcebooks right now and dmsguild doesn&#39;t have all of them. *sigh* looks like i can&#39;t get them legit as i don&#39;t have money for shipping used hardbacks internationally.

            <p>I particularly like the use of the vibrant blue for her tunic - images done solely in the red-green half of the spectrum tend to look fairly samey to me (red-green colourblind, which may be why), so it&#39;s always pleasant to have something that pops out.<br><br>I agree with Zingenmir about the bracers, too - they look like they&#39;re based on something with extremely large scales, or possibly on pinecones.

            <p>I vaguely remember Basil&#39;s name, and this is *excellent*. I think I&#39;d been picturing Agent Alleb as a little younger and with a slightly different face (rounder, not as pointed at the chin), but...wow. This is really, really good! I love the detail and I love how real it looks and yes. Yes, this is very good. And the various leather straps intrigue me.<br><br>~Zing<br><br>PS: Also, the gauntlets. Those are nice gauntlets.

In the meantime, have my warm welcome to the Board -- and a 75-pack of perfectly ordinary paperclips. They hold paper together, and they come in unassuming metal.

            <p>I stirred up a bit of trouble last night on the Discord in a drug-addled rage and it&#39;s since prompted me to finally move on from this mess of a community. Even if I could recover from what I did under the influence of drugs, you know what? I don&#39;t want to.<br><br>The longer I stay here, the less safe I feel. You lot talk so much about upholding the Constitution when all you do is waffle about on making any real decisions and ignore complaints of bullying or brush it off entirely unless someone more &#39;reputable&#39; steps up to the plate. <br><br>When &quot;Brink&quot; was published, not a single one of you gave a damn about the fact that while writing it, Ekyl bullied his way into becoming a cowriter rather than a beta reader, turned the story into what he wanted, and SeaTurtle and Zingenmir didn&#39;t give a rat&#39;s ass when I told them he was making me miserable and wanted him to leave. Yeah, never mind that the incident left me with new scars on my arm and the constant niggling idea to down my entire medicine cabinet at that point. None of you cared.<br><br>Well, none of you except July, but she&#39;s got a bit of a history of being a bully, too, doesn&#39;t she? Not that you care about that, either. She&#39;s a PG. She&#39;s an oldbie. She&#39;s untouchable. &quot;Oh, she was just tired when she started screaming at you over PM abut how you&#39;re in the habit of conspiring with Desdendelle about chasing newbies off the Board, she really is truly sorry about that&quot;. Yeah, sorry she lost her verbal punching bag, maybe. For the record, when I left the last time, I <i>did</i> leave because of her. I just said I didn&#39;t because 1) nothing would have come of it if I did and 2) Data Junkie would have used it as further ammunition for their ripping into July. I&#39;m starting to think they had the right idea.<br><br>I had to start avoiding role-playing on Discord because GlarnBoudin wouldn&#39;t leave me alone, making inappropriate comments about my characters and not taking no for an answer. None of you cared about that until Tomash said something, and what was the result? &quot;Eh, we&#39;ll ban him, maybe. Can&#39;t really be bothered to vote on this. Besides, doesn&#39;t Ix have a history of whining? Can&#39;t she shut up for once about how mean everyone is to her? God, she&#39;s so annoying.&quot;<br><br>I&#39;ve just been growing more resentful and hateful of this place every single day. Bullies and bully apologists, the lot of you. The only reason I was sticking around as long as I did is because I don&#39;t have anywhere else to go. If it&#39;s this bad here, in a community that claims to be intolerant of crap like what I have to put up with, how bad is it out there? <br><br>So good-bye, PPC. I don&#39;t expect you&#39;ll care about this, either. Write it off as Iximaz being dramatic and leaving the Board again.<br><br>I hate all of you.<br><br>Good. Bye.</p>

            <p>...for Ixi to not only deliver a general apology for their outburst, which they did, but also to apologize to the people they called out by name in said outburst on a more personal level. Referring to everyone else around here as bullies is one thing, but accusing several Boarders of specific, individual actions they perceived as being offensive is a different albeit related matter.<br><br>I know I&#39;m not the foremost authority on handling instances like this, but I&#39;ve dealt with tense periods like this before in multiple online communities. Based on what I do know, I feel that even if everyone accepts a general apology there are those who will still feel that the person in question has yet to address specific issues with them in particular.<br><br>Be that as it may, I accept Ixi&#39;s general apology, in part because from what little I was aware of when all this escalated I doubted that they&#39;d had a clear head when they posted the outburst in the first place, what with the effects of their drugs and such. This acceptance comes with the caveat however that personally talking with the people whom they specifically called out would also help a great deal and is recommended as well, so that everyone who got dragged in has a role in defusing and ultimately resolving this kind of situation.</p>

            <p>I realize that I&#39;m hardly the least biased person here, but I do feel that something really ought to be said, and I don&#39;t really see anyone else making the case here, so here goes. <br><br>What I&#39;m more  than aware of is that Iximaz never intended to make that post. They&#39;ve been susceptible to things that are both something I&#39;m incredibly sympathetic toward and not the subject of this post, but they did predispose her toward taking an action she never would&#39;ve considered while sober. <br><br>My issue, however, is that the allegations she made don&#39;t seem to have received much, if any credulity. Actions she claims had serious consequences. Why is no one taking <i>that</i> seriously? Why is no one considering the possibility that while she might never have come out and said anything without being under the influence, that what she&#39;s said is the truth? And why isn&#39;t anyone looking into it to find out whether or not this is the case?<br><br>It seems to me that what I&#39;m seeing is someone who feels harassed finally snapping and asking the community at large to actually investigate the accusations, giving credence to both sides and deciding who did what. Deciding if harassment actually did take place, and ensuring that people don&#39;t feel unsafe here again. <br><br>I think that&#39;s admirable, I think that&#39;s reasonable, and I don&#39;t think that&#39;s something for which they should be made to apologize. I think it&#39;s even beneficial to the community as a whole. Iximaz is a friend to a lot of people here—why is no one listening to her? She made the accusations in an unreasonable state, but I happen to think that&#39;s because she doesn&#39;t think anyone else here will listen to her, and at the time of posting she didn&#39;t care what happened to her in the immediate future. She could finally tell the truth, and make the community aware of what she saw as Ekyl and July harassing her.<br><br>And you&#39;re asking her to apologize for that?</p>

            <p>(I don&#39;t even know how to deal with everything that&#39;s come out up-Board, so I&#39;m starting here. Good god, y&#39;all.)<br><br>Okay, so. Aegis. I understand that you are concerned for Iximaz&#39;s well-being. I am, too—and I apologize for talking <i>about</i> you of necessity here, Iximaz, but I believe I&#39;ve expressed more or less what I&#39;m about to say here <i>to</i> you before, so I hope it doesn&#39;t seem to come out of nowhere. Also, please know that this goes for anyone with mental health issues and the people who love them, not just you and Aegis.<br><br>Before going on, let me establish my credentials on this subject. I&#39;ve been around the block with various forms of mental illness throughout my life (31 years, 32 this June, if anyone&#39;s wondering). Substance abuse, depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, and borderline personality disorder are all present in my family—all at once, in my dad&#39;s case. I&#39;ve dealt with several friends when they were talking about suicide, one of whom was my boyfriend at the time. I&#39;ve been in therapy and been prescribed medication for depression with anxiety myself. Also, my mom worked in the mental health field for roughly twenty years, and she taught me many skills that I&#39;ve used to successfully navigate those situations.<br><br>Please bear all that in mind when I tell you, you need to understand that Iximaz must take responsibility for her own issues and her own choices. My understanding is that she had trust issues before joining the PPC, and that they may in fact be a symptom of her condition. If her illness prevents her from giving us an honest chance to prove that we will take her seriously, or from recognizing the good will of people toward her when it is rampantly on display, there isn&#39;t a single thing any of us can do about that. It&#39;s not our fault she has these deeply ingrained issues, and it&#39;s not our fault if she isn&#39;t doing what she needs to do to work through them.<br><br>Further, if she is not making responsible choices about when to interact with the community and when not to based on her mood/health status, that is not acceptable, and it falls to us as her friends to hold her accountable for it. We are not obliged to tolerate outbursts like this from anyone, <i>especially</i> not if we like them and wish to see them continue to be a valued member of the PPC community and society at large.<br><br>If she <i>cannot</i> make responsible choices for herself, that has very serious implications which go beyond what any of us can handle, because we are not trained mental health professionals. I caution you against making that argument unless you&#39;re prepared to accept those implications.<br><br>I believe, and I want Iximaz to believe, that she does have the power, the personal agency, the ability to make responsible choices for herself. It may take practice, and mistakes may happen, but that doesn&#39;t mean we should lower our expectations. That&#39;s as bad as saying she can&#39;t do it; see above paragraph.<br><br>So, yes, I stand by what I said, and I recommend that you think long and hard about whether denying Iximaz&#39;s responsibility for her actions is really helpful to her in the long run.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>(Not really just directed at you, Tomash - more of a general comment on the trend I&#39;m seeing.)<br><br>I&#39;d appreciate it if we separate perceived &quot;problems with the community&quot; from individuals. This has happened before, I&#39;m certain - people go &quot;Once hS gets involved, everyone listens to him,&quot; and it comes off as an accusation towards Huinesoron. To my mind, this is utterly unreasonable. To hold someone responsible for the way the community respects or listens to them is absurd. Whether one agrees or disagrees with hS, blaming him for the fact that many in the community respects his opinion seems backwards, unfair, and often, really mean-spirited. <br><br>If you think the community doesn&#39;t take someone seriously enough, fine, say so. But to blame another voice for being taken seriously is way off. Other than telling Huinesoron to stop talking because people listen to him, I fail to see how this is a useful topic. </p>

            <p>I would agree, but Ix wasn&#39;t thinking straight when they posted. It&#39;s completely not their fault that the medication caused them to feel like this. And I do have experience with a situation similar to this.

Therefore, I have first hand experience with how medications can impact what people say.<br><br>Additionally, about the &quot;witch-hunt&quot; you mentioned happening on the Discord chat, we were merely trying to decide how to proceed with investigating Ix&#39;s accusations of bullying. That&#39;s not a witch-hunt.<br><br>I would also like to add that if Ix <i>hadn&#39;t</i> been on medications when they posted, then I would expect them to be ashamed.<br></p>

            <p>So, what are we bloody going to do? Iximaz&#39;s post needs a response. I&#39;ll freely admit, I have no solution. Haven&#39;t had time to think of any. What I do know is that, as a community, our response to bullying and accusations of bullying could, at the very least, do with some examination. <br><br>The Discord chat has been buzzing for the past... three hours, I believe. We agreed that we should move to the Board, so everyone can be a part of this discussion. <br><br>Let me briefly outline what the chat has been talking about. In general, many feel that this was a personal failure, as well as a failure on the part of the community. Our failure to act was, in Iximaz&#39;s eyes, a large part of the problem. Indeed, most of it. <br><br>Furthermore, several people think that there&#39;s an error in how we deal with bullying and accusations of bullying. Opinions vary: I feel more comfortable leaving that to individuals to put into their own words. <br><br>Lastly, many people in the Discord chat believe that we need a better response when bullying has been confirmed or is suspected. JulyFlame, several people--not all--think that your behavior is particularly troubling. This is one of the major reasons this post has been made; so that we are not talking without your input on what&#39;s happened. Again, I will leave the particulars of other people&#39;s opinions to their own enunciation. <br><br>Consider this post a summary of the feelings of much of the Discord chat (Iximaz was often in the chat, and talked about these things) and a springboard for further discussion and action. My own thoughts will be forthcoming, once I feel they&#39;re in good order.<br><br>Let&#39;s discuss this like rational human beings. <br><br>-Alleb</p>

            <p>Part of this site’s appeal to me is that the community cares for itself, and that the Nameless Admin is nameless because somebody must hold the keys, but they don’t actually want the authority. Having mods, and elections, and impeachments for mods who don’t do their jobs wouldn’t really solve any problems, it would just insert a new layer. We would still all need to work on making this the place we want it to be.<br><br>I’m not around as often as I would like to be, and I can’t react to situations I’m not aware of, but I’m personally guilty of not caring enough in at least one case, so I’m not exempt from having to work on that. Thus, here’s a promise: I solemnly swear that I will not act rashly, but that I also will not just sit around shaking my head and waiting for people I’m looking up to, when it’s <i>up to me</i>  to call somebody out or – which may more probably be the case – dissolve a mutual misunderstanding.<br><br>This may come off as being too forgiving again, but after reading up, I honestly can’t see any bad intentions in this whole mess. Some of us overreacted and were carried away on Discord, and some of us may now be overreacting to this overreaction. Yes, Tomash screwed up big time, but amends have already been made and I trust that what else might be possible to do will be done soon, and there’s also this second chance thing in the Constitution. What could actually be accomplished by banning Tomash – or anybody else – other than telling them that we perform a symbolic act just so they know that they have been punished? I think our collective opinion has been made clear enough, everybody involved in the unintentional witch hunt is already repenting, and banning is far too serious to be used in a symbolic act. Sometimes, banning is necessary to get rid of unbearable nuisances, and if it is not made permanent, this just expresses hope that the person concerned doesn’t need an infinite amount of time to reform. This is certainly not applicable here.<br><br>Now, muting people on Discord is something I can get behind. If they are prone to talking before thinking things through, and have shown that they can’t be trusted to behave in an online chat, let them stay silent for a while. If we need to hand out punishments, this is what we should vote about.<br><br>HG</p>

I have literally only been part of the PPC for 34 days; add that to the fact that I just vomit out words without thinking when I&#39;m feeling emotional, and you have someone who really should not be part of such an important discussion. In fact, I was pretty aggravating.<br><br>I apologize to Ix for being part of this discussion. I don&#39;t know enough about Ix, about the Brink incident, about the Glarn incident, about mental health, or really any part of this at all! For crying out loud! Why on earth did I think I could <i>help</i>! So yeah, I feel really stupid. Sorry, Ix, I shouldn&#39;t have made myself part of something so important and emotional with so little information.<br><br>Of course, the discussion on the Discord is different from the one on the Board. Everyone is supposed to be part of the Board discussion (at least, that&#39;s what I&#39;m gathering). But I could have stayed out of the Discord one.<br><br>On the subject of bans:<br>I think Tomash should get a month-long ban at the most. I do think his actions were serious. However, they were meant to help, and that does matter.<br><br>Some people have called for Aegis&#39;s ban. That&#39;s just dumb. He&#39;s Ix&#39;s boyfriend! I would be worried if he didn&#39;t have strong feelings about this! It&#39;s only right for him to be agitated about their welfare. Yes, it would have helped for him to take a step back. But that goes for literally everyone on Discord who participated in this fiasco.<br><br>For everyone else on the Discord (everyone else participating, that is), I just have to say that we all let things get really out of hand. We should be embarrassed. Though I don&#39;t think any bans are in order. Except for one, and that one would be mine. Looking back on it, I realize I acted irresponsibly. As a person with very little information, I shouldn&#39;t have tried to be part of the initial argument on Discord. I may be overreacting, but I feel very ashamed of myself, and I think a temporary ban is just.<br><br>Lastly, I think mods are a very good idea. I do like the thought of a community where everyone can be responsible. We cannot do that. We clearly need some people who can propose votes, and announce the final decision. For instance, right now there are a million different ideas floating around the Board about what to do. Consequently, no one knows what to do. We&#39;re just milling around, voting on this or that idea, and it all comes down to nothing happening.<br><br>Sorry if that was slightly incoherent. I&#39;m tired, ashamed of myself, and frustrated with this mess.</p>

            <p>I think you&#39;re being too hard on yourself there. There&#39;s no rule that says newbies have to stay out of the serious stuff, and in fact, your lack of previous involvement might have in many circumstances been a <i>good</i> thing, because you wouldn&#39;t have been coming into the discussion with some preconceived notions about various people. And from what I can tell in the logs, you weren&#39;t running around calling for bans or anything like that. You mostly confined yourself to summaries of what was being discussed and general proposals for reform. <br><br>That said, if you want to ban yourself (from the Discord or the PPC) for a while in penance, I can&#39;t possibly object. Your call.</p>

            <p>I was not aware of most of the matters with Ixi save for the GlarnBoudin incident, and my refusal to help was due to the fact that I didn&#39;t want to risk my friendship with him elsewhere, plus my busy life meant I didn&#39;t know about it until relatively late into the incident. I&#39;m sorry that I did not jump in sooner, and that I didn&#39;t do enough to help resolve the matter.<br><br>As for today, I could&#39;ve avoided being involved with what little information I had, but I jumped in regardless because I had a lot of feelings on the matter that I felt I had to express. Venting is fine and all, but it does nothing without taking actions, and I should&#39;ve been stronger with mine. More importantly, I should&#39;ve stopped the doxxing at the source and called out the ones who were calling for it to be brought up immediately and publicly. July, I am so sorry that I didn&#39;t do more to put a stop to this matter, and also that I didn&#39;t nip it in the bud no matter how much effort I put into halting it as it was. I talked to the wrong person, I tried to solve the wrong issue. Had I known the true extent of what was happening I could&#39;ve done both of these differently and made more of a difference in the aftermath of this matter. And for that, July, I am truly sorry.<br><br>Regarding bans, I agree that Tomash doesn&#39;t deserve a six-month ban, let alone a year-long ban, because he was genuinely trying to help and feels guilty over his actions. That doesn&#39;t change the fact that they were serious, but I think two months would be ideal so that he could take the time off and pull himself together. Nobody else deserves to be banned, though, because I&#39;ve stated more than once that such actions solve nothing and drive people away from this community. Is that what we want people to see the first time they come across the Board?<br><br>Jay- Awesomeness Central, you&#39;re still relatively new, and getting a feel for the community; I think what happened was that you came in close to a very bad time and didn&#39;t know better. I don&#39;t blame you for feeling guilty - I&#39;ve done some of the same things as you have in the past - but  I can also say that outright leaving the community and its problems won&#39;t solve anything, and this is coming from someone who seriously thought at one point that if it weren&#39;t for his unfinished story plots, he&#39;d actually consider it. I too am ashamed of what&#39;s happened, but that doesn&#39;t mean I can&#39;t learn from it, and the same goes to you. I hope you and everyone else can learn from their mistakes and that we can be better prepared for future incidents of this caliber should they arise (I personally pray that they don&#39;t but knowing the Internet, and human society, I don&#39;t think any promises can be made about it).<br><br>I must also state that both you and hS have valid points. Mods are indeed a good idea to keep people in line, but at the same time this is a community where everyone is expected to uphold the Constitution. Higher-ups aren&#39;t necessarily required for the latter, but we must also be careful about the former. To reference an Aesop fable, we don&#39;t want a King Log who can&#39;t effectively manage the pond, nor do we want a King Stork who abuses their power and picks on the frogs he lords over. In light of this, however, there&#39;s a bit of a dilemma in that we could be content with our lot and try to sort through the sheer amount of suggestions about how to better handle the community as a group, or we could try to find the most reasonable authority figures and operate based on at least a small degree of subjectivity. I don&#39;t know if there&#39;s any way we can resolve all of this that doesn&#39;t have at least some disadvantages, but at the very least, we should try to minimize potential problems when selecting mods, if we do, and the rest of us should still continue working to uphold the community standards going forward.</p>

            <p>First, on Tomash: I&#39;ve thought it over, I&#39;ve talked it out, and I&#39;ve come to the conclusion that permanently banning Tomash does not fix anything and would not make our community better. I believe he understands why and how what he did was wrong, has done all he can to undo the damage, and will make every effort to avoid the same mistakes in the future. In addition, he was in good standing prior to this. However, a serious infraction merits a serious response, so a temporary ban may still be in order. Perhaps three months.<br><br>Second, on everyone else named in PC&#39;s revision: an apology is certainly required, not just to July, but to Iximaz, too, for my money. It&#39;s absurd how you&#39;ve allowed your feelings about her to twist you into knots, and it&#39;s unfair to make her responsible for that by continuing to excuse yourselves on the basis that you were worried about her. There are lots of better things you could have done with your feelings. No one needs the burden of their friends&#39; reactivity stirring up unwanted trouble on their behalf—and she&#39;s said repeatedly that she does not want to be the cause of drama.<br><br>However, allow me to propose an alternative to mass banning that still actually penalizes the bad behavior: if possible, lock the Discord temporarily. No one is allowed in for three months, minimum. You abused the privilege of a live chatroom by letting things get out of hand in there, so you all can slum it in forum time with the rest of us for a while. Then, when you go back, perhaps you&#39;ll appreciate it and respect it more.<br><br>I know some of you will protest that you weren&#39;t involved in this fracas, so you shouldn&#39;t lose the privilege. Maybe that&#39;s true, but on the other hand, maybe a temporary personal sacrifice is a small price to pay for justice and a healthier Discord in the future. Think about it before you object.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Here&#39;s what I propose: <b>Banning the people involved in the witch-hunt <i>from the Discord</i> for at least 1-3 months.</b> This way, the people who weren&#39;t involved (like, say, Delta Juliette, Cat On The Keyboard, that one complete twerp called, er, Space Grape? Something like that...) aren&#39;t unfairly penalized for the actions of a few that they were, to pull an example completely out of nowhere, curled up under a duvet unable to stop shaking or crying because they were terrified their best friend didn&#39;t want them around any more. It also serves as a punishment directly related to their actions; if they can&#39;t be trusted to use an IRC channel properly and with respect for others, then they don&#39;t get to do so any more. I think that&#39;s fairer than, if you&#39;ll forgive the obligatory and slightly worn-out fandom reference, turning the Discord into a statue for three months.<br><br>Now it&#39;s my apology time.<br><br>I&#39;m not a well person. I get extraordinarily defensive when I feel that my friends are being attacked. That&#39;s no excuse for what I&#39;ve been saying to multiple people on the Board and Discord, none of whom deserved it. I&#39;m sorry. I&#39;m sorry I got so angry, and I&#39;m sorry I didn&#39;t keep that anger under control. I should know better by now, but it doesn&#39;t appear that I do.<br><br>Given how I&#39;ve comported myself recently, in multiple threads on the Board, I completely understand if people want to push for my being formally punished in some manner. All I want is to be a credit to this community, the community that gave me second, third, seventh, twenty-fifth chances, that picked me up and dusted me off when I fell off the anger wagon time and time again.<br><br>I have failed you.<br><br>Most of all, I&#39;ve failed <b>Ix</b>.<br><br>By letting my anger rule me I have made things worse for them and I, I can&#39;t... I can&#39;t begin to express just how much of a <i>stain</i> upon the surface of the world that makes me feel. You&#39;re my best friend and I have let you down and forced you to defend me for... basically as long as we&#39;ve been friends. I have let you down so, so often.<br><br>I&#39;m sorry.<br><br>I want to fix it.<br><br>I don&#39;t know how.<br><br>I&#39;m scared to find out.</p>

            <p>The Discord ban sounds just like right. So, my idea would be:<br><br>- A medium term &quot;global&quot; ban for Tomash (3-6 months). One year bans are usually reserved for those who don&#39;t come to their senses and apologize, while Tomash did - but, at the same time, apologizing should not be a &quot;get-out-of-jail&quot; card when very serious offenses are made.<br><br>- A short-medium Discord ban as per Scape&#39;s idea (1-3 months), but coupled with a short Board ban as well (2 weeks - 1 month?), with the same reasoning as above.<br><br><br>Mind you, this is not meant in constrast to the second chance granted by the the Constitution, but as a matter of consequences: One must accept the consequences of their own mistakes, as mistakes can have long-lasting consequences on other people.<br><br>July was mass-backstabbed. Just like the wounds to her soul will take time to heal, I believe everyone involved needs to take some time off the Board to reflect deeply on what happened.</p>

            <p>At least, to me. If I&#39;d been able to just restrain myself, none of this would be happening and things would still be fine. I&#39;m at as much fault as anyone here.<br><br>Short of banning everyone from the Discord, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s possible to actually lock it, and looking at how out-of-hand things got on the Board, both now and in the past, I don&#39;t think getting rid of the chatroom would have made much of a difference.</p>

            <p>Before, the meds just made me loopy. They were different meds from the ones that made me, well. Do <i>that</i>; the psychiatrist was trying me on new meds that gave me awful mood swings (seriously, I had to take a few days off work because the withdrawal made things worse and I really don&#39;t want to throw a mic stand at my boss). The voice chat from before wasn&#39;t really different from laughing at the silly stuff your friends do while tipsy. I&#39;ll admit to being amused at some of the stuff I came up with and it doesn&#39;t really bother me. What happened the other night was entirely my fault, though, even more so because I acknowledged I wasn&#39;t feeling myself and thought it would still be a good idea to chat. They were different situations; I don&#39;t think you need to apologize for that.<br><br>Re the Discord &#39;pause&#39; for lack of a better word, yeah, that&#39;s a good point. The only question now is if enough people would actually vote regarding that issue when there&#39;s like sixteen different votes vying for attention at the moment.</p>

            <p>Many people feel that I should be banned from the PPC, either permanently or temporarily, because I posted July&#39;s real name and face in the Discord chat on Thursday. I again acknowledge that what I did was completely unacceptable, and I cannot overstate my regret that I invaded another PPCer&#39;s privacy in such a drastic way.<br><br>I acknowledge that there was a remote possibility that what I did could have posed a threat to July&#39;s life, and I am horrified that I contributed to the possibility of that. I do, however, feel that, given the rather limited distribution of the screenshot (at most, say 30 people, none of whom I believe would want July killed, could have seen it before it was deleted, and I expect that the number of people who actually saw the information that didn&#39;t already know it is much smaller), several people have rather overstated an extremely improbable outcome.<br><br>I would like to attempt to describe what I was (or, more importantly, wasn&#39;t) thinking when I posted that screenshot.  At that time, the chat was considering Iximaz&#39;s allegations. I wanted to provide a piece of evidence that would help the community decide whether or not Iximaz was right. I had been discussing that screenshot privately for several days, and, in my mind, it was the &quot;conversation between July and Iximaz&quot;. In my emotional disarray at Iximaz&#39;s possible death  (which was still entirely possible at the time) and how I might have helped cause it, I didn&#39;t think through what I was posting. I forgot that screenshot contained July&#39;s real name. Not paying attention to that was a terrible mistake, and I yet again apologize to JulyFlame for what I did. It shouldn&#39;t have happened.<br><br>Now, to those of you calling for a permanent ban, I would like to request my Article 7 second chance. I have stopped (or, in this case, attempted to mitigate the damage). I have apologized. I have come to a more complete realization of what I did. I would like to make amends. I beg all of you to allow me to do so instead of driving me out forevermore!<br><br>I don&#39;t know what form the amends will take. That is for you, the community, to decide. There need to be consequences for what I did. A common proposal has been a temporary ban from the Discord or the entire PPC community for some length of time. I can&#39;t say that wouldn&#39;t be an appropriate thing for me to do.<br><br>I&#39;m  a self-imposed ban (one that, in future debates, could be counted as a ban) from at least the chat if not the whole PPC so I can reflect on my actions in this entire mess. Could y&#39;all please suggest an term? I can&#39;t seem to decide what would be a fitting one.<br><br>Additionally, several people have reminded us that a permanent ban has, in the past, been reserved for those who are so detrimental to the continued healthy working of the community that their presence will tear the place apart. They haven&#39;t been, and I understand, weren&#39;t meant to be, a penalty for a first offense by a PPCer who was otherwise in good standing. Is my mistake so terrible a sin that I should be cast out forever? Am I so beyond redemption that I can&#39;t be allowed here? Please tell me if you think that, I would like to know where I stand.<br><br>There are a few additional things I&#39;d like to point out.<br><br>First, I would like to note that this is a much harsher range of proposed responses than were proposed when Matt Cipher harassed July about returning to the Discord. In that case, Matt apologized and resigned his power over the Discord server. To my knowledge, no one called for Matt to be banned. Could we, while voting on this, clarify if the reason for this is that my conduct was so much worse than Matt&#39;s or if it&#39;s because we have decided to get tougher on wrongdoers? I think answering that question will help the PPC make these decisions in the future.<br><br>Secondly, during this thread, there&#39;s been many mentions of witch-hunting and mob mentality. I would like to raise the possibility that many of the people involved in the doxxing, potentially including myself, are being <b>unintentionally</b> targeted by an angry mob. I think it&#39;s possible  that the community, or some parts of if, want something, anything to be done, and my actions and the actions of others in the Discord have made us easy targets for collective anger. That&#39;s not saying I don&#39;t deserve to be punished for this, but could we all please take a moment to make sure I&#39;m being punished with a clear collective head?<br><br>I would also like to ask that, since this is now a community vote, someone start making posts with tallies and such to make it easier to keep track of the status of the vote.<br><br>- Tomash</p>

            <p>This thread has gotten so wild I genuinely don&#39;t know where else to lay out my thoughts.<br><br><br>So, first thought, Tomash. I don&#39;t think he needs to be permabanned. Doxxing someone is absolutely a serious offense, but it&#39;s also (so far as I know) his first in about six years of spotless membership. He has acknowledged it was wrong, apologized repeatedly and profusely for it, and resolved to make amends in whatever way he can. In addition to which, his offense was, or at least seemed to me, a mistake made in dire circumstances with the genuine intention of providing people ait all facts available, rather than a malicious attack or deliberate violation of the rules or common decency. That, to me, is not a situation that merits a permaban. <br><br>Some form of consequence is necessary, certainly, but permabans are not the tool for this job. I strongly believe that they should be reserved for cases where there is a repeated or drastic negative consequence to someone&#39;s continued presence. I do not see that as the case with Tomash, or anyone else involved in this matter. If people want to discuss a temp ban, I&#39;ll leave them to it. I still don&#39;t think it&#39;s the best course, and I&#39;ll vote as such, but I&#39;m only one member.<br><br>Now as to the secondary ban proposals, I strongly oppose banning any of the people mentioned in PC and Des&#39; lists, for any length of time. Witchhunting members of the community is very much Not Cool, but neither is mass banning members on first offenses without first giving due consideration to less drastic courses. Even temporary bans are significant, especially in the case of Khryssty, who&#39;s only been here about a month, if I recall correctly.<br><br>I would also like to voice my concern over the frequency of bans being suggested. Many of the candidates suggested have never had problems before, and are now being considered for bans as long as twelve months, without, as far as I have seen, even any significant effort being made to so much as talk to them about it. This deeply troubles me. I know we want to make it clear that witchhunting/bullying and such things are not tolerated here, but I worry that if we start looking at problems as &quot;does this merit a ban?&quot; rather than &quot;what can we do to resolve this?&quot; we won&#39;t look as hard for more constructive solutions. When all you have is a hammer, and all that. Perhaps I&#39;m just being paranoid, but I would be much reassured if we resolved to at the bare minimum tackle each case individually. This name listing in ban proposals does not sit well with me.<br><br><br>All that aside, though, there is something I would like us all to keep in mind as this discussion goes on, particularly in light of the controversial tone it may take; we all try to be friends (or at least pleasant acquaintances) here. We don&#39;t always succeed, but that&#39;s the goal, so while this is a crisis, try to remember that we&#39;re all doing what we think is best for the community and for each other.<br><br>In that same vein, I would like to thank everyone who has posted so far for participating in this discussion. This is rough stuff, easy to want to shy away from, particularly if you&#39;re not personally involved. It&#39;s gratifying to see everyone weighing in.<br>I especially want to thank Neshomeh, Seafarer, and Storme Hawk for taking the time to so thoroughly and articulately lay out their thoughts on this. I won&#39;t deny I was more than a little fired up when I first started going through this thread, but seeing their comments helped me remember to check my temper before posting.<br><br>Finally, if we do end up calling for a vote—something I would very much prefer to avoid, for the record—I vote <b>no action taken.</b><br><br>-Badger<br><br>P.S.<br>I apologize for the no doubt error-ridden state of this post. It&#39;s taken the better part of the day to catch up on all this and to organize my thoughts on it. Fatigue is not kind to my mental spellchecker.</p>

            <p>Firstly, the difference between your and Matt&#39;s conduct.<br><br>Matt&#39;s harassment of July caused no irrevocable damage. When he saw the error of his ways, he was able to make amends for the totality of his actions - there was no risk of permanent physical or mental harm to July.<br><br>You, on the other hand, posted private information about her in a public place. This potentially placed her at risk of actual, physical harm. This difference, I think, justifies calling for your ban while allowing Matt to remain.<br><br>However, I believe that the people calling for you to be permanently banned are taking things too far. You have been an upstanding member of the community in every post of yours that I&#39;ve seen, and I see no reason for you to be thrown under the bus for a first offence.<br><br>Furthermore, upon having the implications of your behaviour pointed out to you, you immediately recognised that you had done wrong and did everything in your power to make amends for it. By the Constitution, you should be given a second chance, which I think some people here have overlooked.<br><br>Because of the severity of what you did, though, I feel your second chance has to come after a period of banning from the PPC as a whole. There is a risk - however small - that your actions may lead/have led to JulyFlame suffering severe harm.<br><br>I hope that this sufficiently explains my perspective on your situation (and hopefully some of the people calling for permanent bans read this and come to their senses).<br><br>(I&#39;m not sure whether voting is meant to go here, but I&#39;ll say it just in case: I vote for a <b>six month ban</b> of Tomash. I also call upon everyone involved in the Discord debacle to apologise to anyone hurt by their conduct.)</p>

            <p>So, I have seen this idea pitched around a few times in the threads below and in Discord Logs.  I&#39;ll post this here, since I have been considering it for a while.<br><br>I think we need to redo the entire Constitution from the ground up.  My biggest issue regarding the Constitution is the humor inserted into it.  Excerpted below:<br><br>1.  &quot;This webpage will self-destruct in thirty seconds.<br> <br>*Hides; several hours pass*<br> <br>Never mind, then...<br> <br>*Comes out of hiding*<br> <br>BOOM!&quot;<br><br>2.  (And all that other medieval mumbo-jumbo those town criers say. Forsooth verily!)<br><br>3.  6. All discovered mimes will be thrown into a pit, which may or may not be filled with various objects such as scorpions upon their availability.<br> <br>6.5. There will be no clemency for these mimes until they learn the words.<br><br>4.  There is no Article 19.<br><br>5.  &quot;Do not meddle in the affairs of assassins! They are heavily armed and quick to anger. And not noticeably subtle.&quot;<br><br>While I understand these are all quintessentially PPC, I am a firm believer that the rules that govern the community should not be played for laughs at any point.  It can come across as saying <b>Oh we really aren&#39;t all that serious here</b>.  This is a problem.  I think the rules should be changed to reflect the fact that they are indeed serious business.  I also think that we should streamline and simplify the current iteration as well.  We essentially hold a PPC Constitutional Convention.  We can trim the fat from the current Constitution, put in new rules that address events that we did not have before, and ensure that it is the best it can be.  </p>

Not enough people pitched in to ratify it. Some claimed they didn&#39;t feel qualified to comment; most didn&#39;t say anything at all.

            <p>Are you suggesting that because some chose not to speak up at one point on a single issue they are then henceforth banned from ever addressing that issue again in the future?  <br><br>I am also not suggesting something so nonsensical as you think I am suggesting.

            <p>You&#39;re right, I shouldn&#39;t put words in your mouth, and no, I&#39;m not saying that silent once is silent forever.<br><br>My logic train goes something like this:<br><br>As you&#39;ve noted, the idea of revising the Constitution (possibly from scratch) has come up here and in Discord, the idea being to put it in the rules that bullying behavior is not acceptable. Well, we already <i>did</i> that, and I find most of the names involved in the current discussion missing from that conversation. That&#39;s frustrating. The Board had a shot then at getting what they say they want now, but they apparently didn&#39;t take it seriously at the time. I don&#39;t see that it makes any sense to blame a failing of the rules for this situation when the rules would <i>be</i> there right now if more people had said unequivocally &quot;Yes, we want this set in stone, please make it so&quot; when it was under discussion before. That&#39;s what I mean when I say they have no right to complain about the Constitution. A document cannot be blamed for a failure on the part of the people responsible for creating and upholding it.<br><br>To explain the OR ELSE bit: What I see as a major contributing factor to this fracas is a serious lack of understanding of how to handle mental illness. I&#39;ve attempted to explained this in my various posts. Therefore, in my head, any new rules meant to prevent a situation like this from arising again would have to address that facet of it, which I don&#39;t think would be appropriate or effective. That&#39;s where the hyperbole came from. I&#39;m sorry for skipping the context.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I propose to the community that the following actions be taken:<br><br>1) That Tomash be permanently banned from the PPC for sharing someone else&#39;s guarded information without their knowledge or consent. While it was could be interpreted as a negligent act more than a strictly malevolent one, the fact still stands that it was a gross violation of confidentiality and trust. Plus, as Neshomeh mentioned <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=306567;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">here</a>, July is an actively serving member of the United States military. This action thus has the genuine potentiality to threaten her life. An appropriate response must be made.<br><br>2) That the following indivduals—Alleb, Granz, and Khrssty—be banned from the PPC for a period no less than a year. Their voices seem to have been the main driving force behind this witch hunt. And yes, it was a witch hunt, despite what some of you have repeatedly protested. To say otherwise is to be deliberately blind to something very obvious.<br><br>3) That Aegis and Ekyl be banned from the PPC for a period no less than four months. Aegis appears to be the major force behind pushing for the screenshot to be pushed to the board. He has also exacerbated the situation through his actions in Discord and muddied events due to his recent postings on the Board. His behavior in the logs suggests that he had already judged July as being guilty. Ekyl, on the other hand, seems to have been a regularly present voice, poking along the chat with comments such as &quot;And let&#39;s not make it out like July is some angel who&#39;s never wronged anybody ever&quot; or &quot;But these feelings have existed for a long time among many people&quot;. An agitator, if you will.<br><br>4) That the remaining PPCers who were privy to this incident but did nothing to stop it make an official public apology to July. That includes Desdendelle, Akrinor, Storme Hawk, Matt Cypher, SkarmorySilver, Jay - Awesomeness Central, and Hardric. If the PPC had some form of official censure between that and ban, I would have asked for it, but that&#39;s how things go.<br><br>I have no doubt that this proposal will be heavily debated. I welcome your input and hope that we can come together on some sort of agreement.<br><br>PoorCynic</p>

            <p>First: I am sorry that I didn&#39;t say anything during the incident at all. Not when the screenshot went up, not when the witch-hunt was starting before then, and not even the moment I noticed Iximaz had left.<br><br>There is no excuse for my lack of a response to <b>each and every one of these.</b><br><br>I am sorry I didn&#39;t immediately respond to the doxxing.<br><br>I am sorry I didn&#39;t say anything during the extended witch-hunt. At the time, I thought I was trying to gather information and context about the situation while (obviously) worrying about Iximaz; in retrospect, my being passive was a terrible choice to make.<br><br>Finally, to Iximaz: I am sorry for not recognizing harassment by Glarn. I am sorry for not recognizing any moves you&#39;ve made in the past to try and bring bullying here to light and to discuss and act on it in a timely manner. I am sorry for not learning about what harassment looks like online or how people react to being bullied. I intend to fix that as soon as possible.</p>

            <p>Just because something happens often, does not mean it okay or somehow not bad.  And while I am not certain that a permanent ban is both a) the right decision or b) going to solve this issue going forward, I for one believe that we, as a community need to send a strong message that this kind of behavior is not going to be tolerated.<br><br>And before people go, &quot;Oh he apologized&quot; that does not make it better or undo the damage.

            <p>Perfectly happy to oblige. Thanks for the invitation.<br><br>1) I more than agree that Tomash was in the wrong for sharing that information. I more than agree that he ought to be punished. But not only has he already explained why he did the things he did and where he was coming from, he has deleted every copy he had of what was shared (last I heard, the only copy left around was in Ix&#39;s possession, but that might be outdated news now). I have also gathered that this was his first time doing things like this. A perma-ban? I don&#39;t think that&#39;s right. Several months - let&#39;s say six to be on the generous side - should be a sufficient show of not-letting-you-in.<br><br>2) A year&#39;s ban for that? No. That&#39;s still too much. I&#39;m not going to say they should go unpunished - they were undeniably exacerbating the situation, from what I&#39;ve gathered - but a year is way too long. It&#39;s long enough that there would almost be no point in coming back after the sentence was done. Two or three months is still more than I&#39;d really like to give, but I&#39;m trying to be impartial here.<br><br>3) I really don&#39;t have too many problems with Ekyl&#39;s period - but that&#39;s because he has admitted that he doesn&#39;t want an end to this mess. So I&#39;m being a little less objective than I could be on that front.<br>But for Aegis? Heck no. In my opinion, he doesn&#39;t need a ban at all - he was worried for his not-yet-engaged-to-person. But if he were banned at all, a week or two would be fine.<br><br>4) An apology is fine.</p>

            <p>I mentioned that we should, in fact, censor the information to protect July&#39;s privacy. I also specifically requested July&#39;s contact information so that I could get in touch with her obtain both her side of the story and her consent in posting the screenshot (and even that only in the event it became relevant).

            <p>My own, if voted up, I will accept without objection. Heck, if I get a vote in this, I vote for my own. I&#39;m not exactly a constructive influence at the best of times, and, regardless of what I think of any individual person, I can&#39;t say what I think of the community as a whole.<br><br>For the others, however, I think you&#39;re going too far. Tomash, particularly, does not deserve a permanent ban for a single mistake. To be clear, this is in light of the fact that, as far as I know, every copy of the screenshot in question has been deleted. Let us say that the screenshot was available for forty-eight hours, even though I believe it was likely more of a twenty-four hour matter. Assuming that we at least suppose PPC members are not secretly assassins for the Kremlin, that means there is a forty-eight hour window in which a hostile entity could have accessed the Board or Discord and found July&#39;s identity. For this small, accidental window created with the sole intention of bringing context to the general Discord, you propose a permanent removal. Whether there should be a temporary ban, I&#39;ll let others work out. <br><br>On the others? Firstly, a year-long ban effectively is a permanent ban. Expecting most people to come back after a year of absence is ridiculous. Such a period of exile for essentially seeing some kind of problem and wanting to move against it while acknowledging that in order to do so, they would have to take it to the Board, which I would like to remind you, they did, and I would also note that if they hadn&#39;t done so, it&#39;s very possible you wouldn&#39;t even know this had happened. For Aegis and Ekyl? Also ridiculous. We are talking about removing them for a third of a year for, essentially, continuing to present opinions about a future course of action. That&#39;s great. Truly.<br><br>An apology, I think, is in order from everybody, regardless of who is banned for how long, except perhaps Desdendelle, who argued against our actions and couldn&#39;t do much to actually stop us because he can&#39;t, say, forcibly prevent us from posting on the Board. I make one here.<br><br>JulyFlame, I would like to apologize for my actions and thoughts on you. I assumed the worst, without first knowing your side of the story, and because of that, I did not object when your personal information was revealed, and pushed to move the matter into an official inquiry without taking the time to examine why I did so. For this, I am sorry.<br><br>And now, two last notes. The first is on the nature of bans and temporary bans themselves. A ban is supposed to be the removal of an person who, to quote a friend, &quot;.. is a repeat offender, is consistently not accepting of responsibility or punishments, and is unable to fit in with the community whatsoever.&quot; It is only to be used when somebody has proven that they cannot, beyond a shadow of a doubt, repent and reform into a constructive member of the community. A temporary ban is a moral punishment in which one person violates previously existing rules, and is intended to serve as a punishment, not as a way to drive them away from the community without initiating a full ban.<br><br>The second note is something that I believe everybody looking at this message knows, but I will say it anyways, because somebody must. Most, if not all, people looking at this thread say that Desdendelle&#39;s idea cannot be implemented, and so you have devised this new version, targeting specific people in order to attempt to sway others who would be opposed to this under most circumstances, to vote for lesser punishments in order to avoid ones of the severity you have proposed. I intend to pass no judgement here, I simply want to spell out what I think is on everybody&#39;s minds, that it may be acknowledged, perhaps argued against, and eventually moved past without turning into a festering sore in the minds of some.<br><br>This is all I have to say on the matter.</p>

            <p>Not everyone who said anything in the disaster wanted to go through with the Board doxxing. I know didn&#39;t. I&#39;ve said multiple times that I told Aegis via PM not to go through with posting the info on the Board unless it was really needed, with consent, and with all personal information obscured for safety. I had not, to my knowledge, seen any instance of the information in the screencap being called for. I knew it wasn&#39;t a good idea to have anything to do with that screenshot; what I didn&#39;t know at the time is that the Discord channel is as public as the Board because not only could people who have access pop in and see the screenshot simply by scrolling to the conversation date, but the invite is publicly distributed so that, well, anyone else could. I&#39;ve stated several times that I cannot apologize enough for not taking action against Tomash, and for doing absolutely nothing about the screencap being put on the Discord in the first place, as hS noted. I&#39;m a busy, busy person, I was working on proofreading multiple academic papers at the time, and my dad was sitting right behind me while all this was happening, so if he so much as glanced in my direction I could be in serious trouble. Hence my relative lack of activity compared to certain other members. I&#39;ve realized since then that I should&#39;ve just taken the risk and spoken up against the Discord doxxing in the first place. Hindsight is 20/20, I guess.<br><br>With that being said, I have already apologized to the Board at large for not acting when I should have - and for that matter, not directing the actions I did take at the source of the issue - and I am willing to extend my apologies to JulyFlame specifically for the same reason. So, I imagine, would everyone else you&#39;ve listed who have to do the same thing.<br><br>What I am not convinced about, however, is the notion that outright banning a number of people for taking part in a single huge offense is the best choice, especially after they&#39;ve admitted, repeatedly, that they feel genuinely guilty about their actions. Tomash has stepped down as a chat mod and apologized multiple times to the entire Board for this incident. Granz and Alleb have also stated that they feel awful and that they won&#39;t repeat anything even close to this. I believe their words and accept their apologies, but at the same time I do feel that just a simple warning might not be enough. Banning them from the entire PPC community, though, is probably going to do more harm than good, even if said ban is temporary. Even if it was for good reason, I believe it would send the wrong message to those who&#39;ve just found us and taken a first glance at what&#39;s been going on. Permabanning Tomash, who has been apologetic about the doxxing ever since it was first pointed out, could give the impression that you&#39;re not willing to listen to his feelings and give him a second chance. The closest I can think of to a metaphorical slap on the wrist would probably be to temporarily kick him and the others who started and/or exacerbated this incident from the Discord, for the amount of time you&#39;ve proposed for each of them, but still allow them to participate in the PPC community as a whole, thereby at least giving them a chance to learn from their collective mistake. I don&#39;t know what other people would think of this, but it&#39;s probably the best approach I can think of to penalizing the kickstarting of what was plainly a witch hunt (even if I didn&#39;t realize that it was at the time). I repeatedly stated that there was nothing any of us could do to make things better, and I should&#39;ve added that rampaging after someone else as though they were some sort of scapegoat would ultimately result in a complete and total cataclysm for everyone concerned. I can personally attest to that, having been subject to a witch hunt at least once in the past, and I can say with confidence that we as a community can and should do better than to start anything even close to one.<br><br>Be that as it may, I&#39;ve stated this before in the Discord chat, and I&#39;ll state it again here: I am very, very disappointed in and ashamed of this entire clusterflock and the current state of the community in light of it. I joined the PPC in the hopes that it&#39;d be more welcoming than any previous online community I&#39;d known, but my faith in it has been repeatedly shaken, though not yet broken, by things like this happening more than once. In the aftermath of this fiasco, a very small part of me wants to say that if it weren&#39;t for my PPC writing responsibilities and the fact that I&#39;ve made a number of good friends here that I can only contact via the PPC, I&#39;d have walked out on everyone else here without a second thought. It&#39;s only a very small part, though, and I know ragequitting would not be helpful to anyone when I , and everyone else, should be striving to make this community a better place for anyone who visits it. (I&#39;m also going to take this moment to say that I&#39;m not even close to interested in being a mod for the Discord channel, having read your earlier opposition to electing anyone who was involved in this mess to that position. I&#39;ve been through multiple occasions that have demonstrated that I&#39;d make a horrible admin, plus I don&#39;t have even half the time to manage the Discord chat when I have so many other things to do as it is.)<br><br>Still, we as a community are better than this. We should be, and I hope we can be in the future. As it stands, though, there&#39;s still a long way to go before we can repair the damage that&#39;s been done to our collective spirit over the past few months, especially the past few days. <s>And honestly, I think it&#39;s probably for the better that I distance myself from this whole conversation until my input or intervention is needed. The longer I read this entire mess, the worse I feel.</s></p>

            <p>I don&#39;t care for him or his contributions to the PPC one whit, but that doesn&#39;t and shouldn&#39;t invalidate his judgement; while I have my reservations about a self-confessed lurker barrelling into a sensitive discussion, this doesn&#39;t mean he shouldn&#39;t be listened to.

            <p>On the principle of making a public apology... I accept the idea of doing one for not doing more than one or two statements to Aegis to calm down during this mess, although I&#39;ll also tell that I couldn&#39;t really do more at the moment, given the fact that despite what my indicator could say, my access to Discord during the week is at the very best sporadic. I didn&#39;t have a real opportunity to tell more, I&#39;m working during the week, and that lets me very little time for the PPC, especially when most of the dscussion are during American time.<br><br>But... Desdendelle, seriously? He pretty much told how much of a bad idea it was during the entire moment of the discussion he was present, stressing at every turn how wrong it was. How exactly does that account for doing nothing? <br><br>Besides... Well, I said my access to the chat was sporadic, but what about other people being automatically connected to Discod because they dowloaded the app but aren&#39;t actually following the discussion, or cannot? If they couldn&#39;t do something, punishing them for that doesn&#39;t seem to be really fair.<br><br>As for the apology, I&#39;m ready to make a dedicated post when you see fit.</p>

            <p>As I am sure you are all well aware, recently I have been distant from the PPC. My job and it&#39;s fluctuating hours are in large part to blame for this, as with other real life commitments. By no means was this because I care for the community any less than I ever have. However, clearly I have not been nearly as approachable, nor as good of a friend as I would have liked to be. I have been supposedly active during a number of instances where I should have been a a friend, a means of support, but I was gone. I am so sorry Ix. I should have been a better friend. I don&#39;t even know if I deserve that title. I can only hope to be better in the future. I&#39;m so sorry. Truly, I am.<br><br>That. All. Being. Said.<br><br>Guys.<br><br>What are we doing.<br><br>I don&#39;t like to sick my head into drama. It gets nasty, and I feel this community often guides itself towards the right path sooner or later. However, this time, there has been a while lot of yelling, and not a lot of action. So. Here I am to try and throw my voice in.<br><br>First, and foremost, accusations of harassment are extremely serious, and should be treated as such. Our reaction process has been slow in the past, mostly due to inaction on members of the community. I am part of this problem. As stated, I stay out of drama, as I trust cooler heads to judge. So, I feel that we need swifter action to examine and, if necessary, punish those who are harassing other members of this community. Clearly, asking for board-wide approval takes far, far too long for any feeling of closure. For the Discord, this is simple: mods need to bring down kicks harder and sooner. Not necessarily bans, but make it very clear when people have been out of line. Hit them with a warning. Second offense, a kick. Third, a temp ban, potentially permanent depending on severity. Also depending on severity, might skip the warning and jump straight to kicking. Needs to be done, needs to have been done a while ago.<br><br>However, for board, and community-wide response, this is trickier. My initial reaction is to have a panel of judges, to overview and determine: <br>1. Is there a case of wrongdoing <br>2. How we respond<br>The natural candidates for these judges are Permission Givers. We already, as a community, trust them to determine who can write in our shared universe. However, my hesitation towards giving them this extra responsibility is that it would put too much onto the plates of these select people. When they signed up for the job, all they asked for was to read stories and say if the author could write reasonably well. Now, we would be asking them to become effectively moderators. We have resisted the use of moderators on the Board for a long time, for many valid reasons. However, I think it has been clearly shown that we need faster, more decisive judgement. Moderators seem to be the best way of doing that.<br><br>Now, onto the issue of banning people right now. In my view, there is only one person who should possibly, maybe, be banned, and that is Tomash. Now, in my view, he has been shamed enough, has been shown quite thoroughly the error of his ways, and has profusely apologized for what he has done. Do not take this to mean I endorse what he did. It was a despicable act, and I do not blame those who want to see him banned. But, in my view, he has gone though enough. Consider this a NO BAN vote, but I will not object if we rule to ban.<br><br>However, the others on Desdendelle&#39;s little list: under no circumstances should they be banned at all. If I believe Tomash has received enough of a beating, lord knows I am not in favor of harsh punishment towards those members of the community either. Now, let me make this very, very clear. If you stood by while somebody was doxxed, or heaven help me, endorsed it at the time, you were in the severe wrong. What was done was immoral to a high degree, and may in fact be illegal. Shame on you. However, that is all that reprimand that should be done on these members. I feel this extreme outburst we have had as a community shows how we feel about the subject: we do not approve, and will not allow it to happen again. If it does, for any reason, to anybody, after this little debacle? I might be less forgiving. However, for now, we as a community need to heal. And we don&#39;t heal and repair by banning half the user base.<br><br>So, in conclusion, I feel it is high time this community has official moderators, who are elected to judge and enforce rules on behalf of the community at large. We have been too slow before. It is time to change it. Other then that, no changes needed to the Constitution. I feel that particular document is very, very clear and very well-written. Far more so than any other online community I can think of. We just need people to enforce it.</p>

If following Article 7 doesn&#39;t resolve a situation, any and all uninvolved community members have a responsibility to back up the person who is in the right, or to defuse an unclear situation. It is never wrong to ask a third party to comment on a dispute, but try to find someone uninvolved; a mediator will be more useful for resolving a dispute than a supporter.</i><br><br>When Iximaz and July had their argument, I talked to both of them, and helped July with her apology.

When Iximaz and GlarnBoudin had <i>their</i> argument, I looked at what was said and offered an opinion - and when my view was challenged, I reconsidered it and posted that I had. When Desdendelle shamed Iximaz, I spoke up. When I heard July had been doxxed, I got hold of the chat logs and spoke up.<br><br>I do not stand by. I do not let things happen. You may disagree with the conclusions I draw, the actions I suggest, the blame I lay or withhold, but you can never point at me and say I just ignore problems. If everybody in this community can do the same, this will never happen again.<br><br>And I want desperately for that to happen. This place, this Board and this PPC, is something precious, something unique. It&#39;s a place where we don&#39;t look to authority to keep us in check, but where we take responsibility for our own actions, and where we stand up for our friends when they are attacked. It&#39;s a place where we want to know the facts before we form our opinions - and when new information comes to light or our views are challenged, we don&#39;t lash out, but reconsider and reevaluate.<br><br>That&#39;s what I believe. That&#39;s the PPC I have stood for, for nearly fifteen years now. That&#39;s the community I trust every one of you to stand up for.<br><br>I want to give a huge shout-out to ninny4370 here. They are literally the newest person here, but they have stood up and called out the problem they see, and what they think we should do about it. I may not agree with what they suggest, but I am immensely impressed that they are saying it.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>These thoughts might not mean all that much to most of you, as I have largely receded into semi-lurker status, but I need to express them regardless. Good job, folks. You&#39;ve really ticked me off.<br><br>First off, Iximaz? I am sorry for everything you are going through. It&#39;s obviously a difficult time for you, and you have my sympathy. Get well soon.<br><br>Now then, as for those involved in the railroading of JulyFlame… screw you. Screw you all. Sorry, I tried to think of something diplomatic to say, but I&#39;m coming off of a nasty illness and pretty much coughed up the last of my available diplomacy this morning. What on Earth possessed you all to do something so craven, so stupid, so… very much against the spirit of this community? I certainly see a lot of excuses being cited by those involved: fear, anger, good intentions. Great, yeah. Acting on those has never backfired on anyone ever.<br><br>But I&#39;m sure most of you just wanted what was best for your friend. Fair enough. I would hope that you all learn a lesson from this. If nothing else, you might learn to stop before you do something and consider how what you say, or what you write, might hurt someone. Maybe not the person you&#39;re talking to, but someone. Somewhere. Remember, this is the Internet.<br><br>On a personal note, I would like to share with you all how utterly disappointed I am to see the community as it is now. There are a couple of unnamed people in this thread whose actions and excuses have downright disgusted me. I would hope that those people come to their senses, but I sincerely doubt they will.<br><br>Regarding the open Discord mod positions, I say this: I will oppose the appointment or election of anyone to that position who was involved in this incident. And it will be a vocal opposition.<br><br>Sometime tomorrow morning, I will be posting a revised ban proposal. It will not be as… dramatic as Desdendelle&#39;s, but it will exist and it will be serious. What occurred was a violation of privacy, of confidentiality, of trust. Some sort of corrective action needs to be taken.</p>

            <p>Wikipedia has this thing called an interaction ban. Basically, it&#39;s an enforced agreement not to interact with each otheR.

            <p>I&#39;ve got a rather bad habit of not speaking and avoiding problems when I face them.

Then there was the... duck subtlety, stalinian process against July. <br><br>Unless my memory is driving me nuts, I spoke only twice during this whole debacle, and I was aiming for Aegis to calm down. <br><br>Des was telling him on all the tones what he was doing wasn&#39;t a good idea in any univrse, and Aegis didn&#39;t bulge. One of my two interventions was bouncing off on a reply Nyme had posted to stress the just wrong aspects of his demarch and got him to think really hard before doing it.<br><br> He said he would take time to calm down, so that somewhat worked, and didn&#39;t did anything more, both for a lack of time and a no envy at all to go in a discussion which showed all signs of going to total toxicity.<br><br>I didn&#39;t posted here when I could have the time here before that because of said bad habit of not wanting to be near violent discussions. That&#39;s all. I guess that&#39;s weakness and a default, but approbation for toxic self-destruction it&#39;s not. At all.</p>

            <p>Not that I expected anyone to take that seriously, but if this isn&#39;t the Board on fire, I don&#39;t know what is.<br><br>Look. I agree that Tomash must go up for a ban. I say this with deep regret, because I have always liked and respected Tomash up til now, I&#39;d miss him, and I recognize that losing him likely means losing T-Board as well, but if anyone with a lesser reputation had done this thing, and if the victim had been anyone less controversial than July, it would not even be a question; it would be done. It cannot be overstated that this indiscretion is potentially <i>life-threatening</i> to July, who is active in the military, which does have enemies. The rules for her are not the same as for someone who is a private citizen.

            <p>It&#39;s not just this incident, though. It&#39;s everything that I&#39;ve observed tends to happen in an environment where people feel they&#39;re behind closed doors and don&#39;t have to consider their words and edit themselves before they speak. It&#39;s <i>much</i> easier for things to get blown out of proportion in that environment. Up til now I&#39;ve thought this group might be better than that, but honestly, when emotions run high and mob mentality kicks in, the group is only as smart as the lowest common denominator. I&#39;m not pulling that out of my butt—I actually took a class on it in college. Hence, while I still think the people as individuals are mostly just fine, I distrust the environment that encourages groupthink.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Looking back at all of this, I have to agree with both sides of the argument here. Yes, doxxing is horrible and does not deserve to be mentioned in the same sentence as any PPC boarder. Heck, it does not deserve to be mentioned in the same sentence as anybody&#39;s Internet usernames anywhere, period. It&#39;s put lives at risk in the past, and a quick look at the article about it on Wikipedia has confirmed that it&#39;s actually led to the deaths of almost a dozen people since the 1990&#39;s. On a more personal level, when I got involved in drama a few years ago, I started worrying, albeit irrationally, that I&#39;d be doxxed by at least a few of the others involved and suffer physical harm, or worse. I would never consider doxxing anyone I&#39;ve fallen out with online, ever.<br><br>That being said, outright banning everyone involved in the entire discussion, even those who weren&#39;t there to see the screencap fiasco, will solve absolutely nothing and, I fear, may continue putting us in a negative light.  Sure, I did chime in a few times when said screencap happened, but I only realized the gravity of what was going down at the time long after the fact. While I did drop out of the conversation due to being busy with personal matters, I PM&#39;d Aegis later on and told him that I was firmly on your side, that this information should not be released publicly, and that doing so would come back to hurt everyone involved and couldn&#39;t be retracted. In hindsight I realize that a better course of action would have been to talk to Tomash directly and to tell him to delete the screencap from the Discord chat as well as his computer files if applicable (which is most likely the case). I apologize for not doing so immediately and also for not making a public attempt to decry the screencap incident while it was happening. My awful time management skills do not excuse the fact that I did nothing to stop this and if I have to deal with the consequences of my nonaction then I&#39;m willing to accept them.<br><br>With that being said, however, outright banning every single participant in the whole conversation, including yourself, seems like an act of haste, and likely anger over the whole incident, as justified as it was. I don&#39;t know if the ban is from the Discord chat or from the PPC in its entirety, but shutting people out of this community just because they either were led by herd mentality to make a collective mistake will send a very bad message to anyone who happens upon the Board or other PPC-affiliated places online and thinks that we drop the banhammer willy-nilly for committing just one perceived offense.<br><br>I don&#39;t disagree that what Tomash did was unimaginably wrong, and I don&#39;t disagree that ganging up on July was just as bad. But making propositions out of sheer anger is likely to do more harm than good, especially in circumstances as dubious as this. I hope we can all learn from this, end this vicious cycle, and find a better way to handle drama, bullying, and general grossness, but I personally think insta-banning half the currently active PPC community because of one disastrous conversation is anything but that way.</p>

No one here is denying that. But I also think taking away his position as a moderator is punishment enough. This is considering he posted a screenshot he shouldn&#39;t have posted in the heat of the moment when he assumed his friend was <i>dead</i> is not an action that calls for a ban. <br><br>Namely, because I don&#39;t see bans in this instance as a method for punishing people, but ways to eliminate nuisances from the PPC as a whole. I think that, on balance, Tomash&#39;s presence is a constructive one. <br><br>In summary I think that stripping him of modship is punishment enough, because what I see isn&#39;t indicative of a malicious presence in the PPC.</p>

            <p>After a great deal of reflection, and more than a few conversations with certain parties, I agree that Tomash need not be banned, even if there is some punishment further than a loss of modship. What this further punishment would be, I am at a loss to.<br><br>However, I do stand by one earlier statement of mine. If we do impose a ban on Tomash, since this is, in essence, a retroactive application of the law, if anybody currently active has been accused of either revealing private information of another PPCer or harassing another PPCer, we should investigate those cases and try them according to the new methods.</p>

            <p>Here&#39;s what I did wrong:<br><br>I participated in what has been deemed a witch-hunt. I helped <i>direct</i> the witch-hunt (see <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=306516;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">VM&#39;s post</a>). This was wrong.<br><br>I didn&#39;t stand up, didn&#39;t speak, when July was doxxed. This was wrong. <br><br>I didn&#39;t try to calm tempers; I inflamed them, and was inflamed myself. This was wrong. <br><br>I have a few words in my defense, but they don&#39;t absolve me. Namely, I&#39;ve chatted with July before, and I&#39;ve seen the info in the screenshot before. Thus, when I saw the screenshot, I didn&#39;t think, &quot;July has been doxxed.&quot; Doesn&#39;t excuse me--heck, it&#39;s more evidence that I wasn&#39;t thinking things through--but for me, at least, it wasn&#39;t new info. &quot;I didn&#39;t really think about it&quot; isn&#39;t exactly an excuse, though. <br><br>I was also worried about Ixi at the time, but that&#39;s no excuse, either. In fact, this worry should have made me more sensitive to others being wronged. But it didn&#39;t. I was an idiot.<br><br>Listen. I love this community. I spend a lot of my time here; I have a lot of friends here. I don&#39;t want to be banned. But what I did was wrong. I don&#39;t think July deserves this. July <b><i>certainly</i></b> didn&#39;t deserve to have any info posted--that goes without saying. We should all step back and calm down.<br><br>So... yeah. I&#39;ve got to say, I don&#39;t think I deserve a ban. I was wrong, I did wrong, but I didn&#39;t have malicious intent. I thought that there were grievances to be addressed. So I&#39;m going to ask that I not be banned--but that decision lies entirely with the community. <br><br>I&#39;m going to step back for a few days. I&#39;ll be available for PM and Hangouts, but I won&#39;t be on the Board or in the main Discord chat. I&#39;ll let you all come to an agreement. <br><br>One last thing. Um, I know most of you aren&#39;t Christians, but <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs%2015">Proverbs 15</a> sort of slapped me in the face. It&#39;s what I should have been doing this whole time, but didn&#39;t. It&#39;s worth a read. <br><br>-Alleb</p>

            <p>Well, firstly, Tomash. I cannot myself make a judgement on whether what he did was illegal or not, but it was, in my opinion, a bad idea at the very least, and immoral and malicious at the very worst, although I do not think it goes that far. As he has resigned, I say ban him for a period no shorter than two weeks, but no longer than two months. This will give him long enough to think on his actions without being overly harsh.<br><br>As to myself, if I am banned, I will make no argument against it. I do not particularly wish to be, but seeing as yesterday, I made decisions out of fear and anger and, even if I did think revealing July&#39;s name and face were going too far, I did not speak out against it at the time. I do not know if I can be trusted without some form of punishment.<br><br>However, as to everybody else, I know some were not on for the entire thing. Aegis, especially, I believe was mostly there to notify us that Ix was alive. Furthermore, those who were there for the majority of the discussion were attempting to steer it into an actual discussion, not a witch-hunt, and several advocated at least taking this to the Board. And here is when I make a point about mass bans. The thing about Discord is, it&#39;s ridiculously easy to make a server. I made one in about a minute. Should we decide to invoke a mass ban, it would take me about ten to send off invites to everybody who has been banned, essentially splitting the PPC in two. I might not even use the dang thing, but my point is, you wouldn&#39;t really be punishing anybody, especially given that all it takes is a third person to put two people back in contact, creating an underground network that means that nobody is banned, ever. Such things only work when you have one or two toxic people who the group collectively agrees to remove from themselves and not speak to. Attempting this method would undermine the implementation of such systems in the future.</p>

            <p>So you propose to ban basically everyone in that conversation.<br>Firstly, as Tomash said, most of us did not know wether Ix had taken their own life, so I think it&#39;s viable to say that we all might just have been a little bit tense at that time, as well as on the verge of panicking.<br>Secondly, a big part of the later conversation was sparked by Aegis asking you to contact JulyFlame, <i>since you had her contact info</i> and asking for her consent on posting the conversation on the board. All the time while you were accusing us of not even trying to get her side of the story, when it was quite clearly part of what we were trying to do.<br>Lastly, even if you were justified in your calls for bans, if I recall correctly, in most cases the Constitution actually doesn&#39;t allow bans for &quot;first offenders&quot;, which, if I am not mistaken, would constitute most of those you called out, barring actual illegal activity, which, except in Tomash&#39;s case, did not apply. I think the exact phrase used was &quot;Everyone deserves a second chance.&quot;.<br><br>~Ak<br><br>P.S.

And no, I am not going to accept the &quot;we didn&#39;t know if Iximaz was even alive&quot; thing - they continued well after the reveal that Ix was alright.<br><br>And what I saw made me so scared I failed to take action. I didn&#39;t stop the nastyness against July. I did only a pathetic attempt at rebuking the accusations against Huinesoron (which I&#39;m afraid it was read as me willing to bop hS if he were to pass the thing as nothing, when I meant that if hS were to be like that I would be disappointed because that simply wouldn&#39;t have been the hS I know). I failed to help Desdendelle try to get people to reason.<br><br>I was afraid I would just become the next target, as I could be easily passed off as one of the &quot;July-covering oldbies&quot;<br><br>So I believe some kind of action is needed. I don&#39;t believe we should decide what right now, and of course we should look into actual individual responsibilites and not simply bring down the ban-hammer with the same setting on everyone - a couple days for cooling down before taking a decision, as ninny suggested, might be the best thing to do now.<br><br>But the sheer amount of <i>hate</i> I saw in that chat should not be treated lighly, and should not be let pass.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m generally opposed to bans, but here I agree some need to be handed down.  First, Tomash.  I largely agree with Seafarer above.  But I am not sure it goes far enough.  I do not think 6 months is enough, this is illegal behavior, and a very clear message needs to be sent that that is unacceptable in all circumstances.  I do not know if a permanent ban is required, but we need a strong response.<br><br>I actually also second one, or at least some form of discipline for Alleb and Granz as well in this case.  While I agree that there should not be guilt by association, both of them did definitively ask for the private information be released.  Which is also wrong.<br><br>As for the rest of them I do not think anything they did quite rises to the level of significant discipline.  Unless we are starting to punish for inaction now.  <br><br>But bottom line is that conversation was <b>absolutely disgusting and SHOULD NOT be tolerated.</b>  If this community is willing to tolerate that kind of behavior then we need to reevaluate.</p>

            <p>To all of those except Tomash.<br><br>I read the logs. I know that what Tomash did was awful. But I say no to guilt by association.<br><br>Here&#39;s what I say: strip Tomash of mod powers. <b>Ban</b> him for at least <b>six months</b>. Actions like his which are not only immoral but actually illegal <i>have to be punished</i>, or there is no justice in the community.<br><br>(Actually, I might be convinced of a lesser ban for anyone implying that July deserved it for her actions - innocent until proven guilty and punishment must fit the crime and all that. But I only saw one or two people even getting close to that.)<br><br>And with that... we need to let this go. July&#39;s not here to defend herself, so any investigation into her actions cannot continue. <i>Right now</i>, we need to work out how to deal with this sort of thing in future and then set it in stone, in the rules.</p>

            <p>There are a couple of people I think action needs to be taken against.<br><br>First, Khryssty said (paraphrased) &quot;It&#39;s okay to dox someone if they&#39;re a bully&quot;.

That was just complete disrespect for someone who wasn&#39;t there to answer, and who has in my experience always been calm and patient, listening to everyone&#39;s versions of events before making a call. I see that Scape and hS have talked about that, though.<br><br>Then I saw Des say &quot;I don&#39;t think accusing July of bullying is right.&quot; And, uh, that isn&#39;t okay either. That&#39;s basically saying that July is somehow above the rules against bullying. I&#39;m sure Des didn&#39;t mean it that way, but <i>man</i>. That alongside Des&#39;s lofty, dismissive tone and words (towards Aegis especially) have caused me to lose the respect I had for him.<br><br>Soooo... I wouldn&#39;t be averse to action being taken against the individuals named above, in addition to Tomash.</p>

            <p>Perhaps with a lessening on Tomash&#39;s ban, as due to the conversation with EvilAI, whether his actions were actually illegal or not is a bit of a grey area. <br><br>As to my actions, I would first like to say that, baring one post of Alleb&#39;s that I agreed with, I did not target July, nor did I intend to target July with anything that I said that day. I was there when it all... kicked off (admittedly it was around 4-5 in the morning for me and I hadn&#39;t gone to sleep yet so I wasn&#39;t sure what to expect upon waking up). As I now frequently do, I logged onto Discord on Thursday in the school library after a rather important meeting about my future on my course (not that it&#39;s that important, I just like putting all the details in (BTW it went well)), and I got on somewhere around 4pm (4:18pm is when I make my first post to be precise) and coming into the middle of the conversation, promptly forgot about the work I was meant to be doing and went to read up on everything that had happened (and then proceed to swear a lot at what had happened, silently of course (I was still in the library after all)).    <br><br>Then at 4:21pm I make my first post, in which I&#39;m generally talking about Ix&#39;s leaving post on the board, specifically expressing a wish to post something despite not really being around for much of what Ix was talking about apart from the Glarn incidents and I quote &quot;but I know saying that to Ix will make it sound as if I was ignoring them, and I&#39;m left in a really difficult place.&quot; I then also expressed interest in hearing SeaTurtle&#39;s side of the Brink incident, mostly because out of the three other people still in the PPC at that time who were involved with the incident, SeaTurtle is the one I trust, and think of as my friend, the most (No offence meant to Ekyl and Zingenmir).<br><br>After six or so minutes, I then make this post, in reference to the new rules that may or may not be introduced.<br>&quot;Part of me wonders if it would be better for us to instead of keep fixing up the Constitution to scrap it and rebuild it from scratch, and then have some way of actually keeping people to it so that bullies are  fittingly punished.&quot;<br>And I honestly mean it, and I still do believe that what I said could be a good solution. I was trying to have an actual discussion about whether our current Constitution really, truly works for cases of bullying, and whilst I will admit I didn&#39;t have a copy of the Constitution next to me, or open on my browser at all. I honestly think that we need to change it, at least in part, to make sure nothing like this (both the whole incident surround Ix, and the consequences of it and the whole mess (for I don&#39;t know a better way of putting it) that it has caused afterwards. <br><br>Then came my big mistake. I agreed with Alleb when they stated. &quot;The image itself should probably be posted.&quot; We all know the image that is being talked about, and now coming back to it, I realize I should of said more than just &quot;^&quot;. I should of said, as I believed it would have been understood at the time, that the proper consent would be given before the image was posted and, due to the fact I have never (and probably now will never) use Hangouts (or whatever it was), I did not realize said image would contain a picture of July and they&#39;re name, I believed it&#39;d contain, much like on Discord some kind of profile picture and a username similar to the ones we use in the PPC. I was ignorant, and I should of said more than I did, I&#39;ll admit I&#39;m guilty to that much. <br><br>A minute or two later I responded to Granz&#39;s post of:<br>&quot;Do we include specific articles dealing with punishment in the Constitution, should we rewrite It? How specific do we get? How do we actually put it into practice? And seconding the posting of the image.&quot;  <br>With:<br>&quot;Yes, there should be articles in the Constitution about the punishment, so that those who think they&#39;ll be able to get away with bullying others will know exactly what will happen to them in turn.&quot;<br>With regards to my previous post saying about redoing the Constitution. I&#39;ll admit, reading that back I sound like a bit of a dick, it could come across as a bit hard (I generally am towards bullies, for reasons I mention later), but once again this was me trying to have a discussion about redoing the Constitution, this wasn&#39;t aimed towards anyone specifically, it was about honestly believing (at that time) that parts of the Constitution are flawed and need to be changed to help better prevent and punish bullies in the community. I then also follow up with<br>&quot;We need to take a hard fast stance on bullies or else we might as well not take a stance at all.&quot;<br><br>Granz then asked a couple of questions that I didn&#39;t (and still don&#39;t) have a proper answer to. As far as I was aware, for this part of the conversation we were having a discussion about potentially redoing the Constitution itself, and whether that would actually work. I respond with my reasons for my stance on bullying. <br>&quot;I was bullied for 11 years of my life because my teachers thought the best thing to do when an act of bullying was reported was to gather the two parties in a room and tell the bullies to, and I quote &quot;Not do that again.&quot; And then send us on our ways.&quot; I&#39;ll admit, I&#39;m not the most comfortable to post this on the internet at large, but I think it needs to be said to understand where I come from with regards to bullies (And for those who are interested, I&#39;m currently 22, so yes, that is half my life I&#39;ve been bullied. But once again, this (to me) merely justifies my stance towards bullies and basically nothing else).<br><br>In response to Khryssty&#39;s very fair questions of &quot;What worries me is the degree of waffling this has revealed in the community. Will I really be safe here?&quot;<br>I responded with: &quot;You&#39;ll be safe, that is one thing I would always promise to uphold (and always do)&quot; And it&#39;s true that I try and do that, and that I try and be firm but fair when I am called upon to settle disputes in the other corners of the internet that I hang out in, however rarely it happens these days. I realize that this could be read as &quot;I want to rule the board/PPC with an iron fist.&quot; I don&#39;t, far from it. I am just saying that I try and make sure everyone feels safe whenever I can.<br><br>I make a couple of little comments before mentioning &quot;Yeah, and also some people don&#39;t know about certain situations because they simply weren&#39;t there for them. So how can they comment on it if they don&#39;t know about it?&quot; In response to (for me) the fact that in Ix&#39;s leaving post (I mean no offense here) I felt like they were blaming everyone in the PPC for either taking part in, or not standing by her during the three incidents that she had mentioned, I was trying to counter-claim by saying that, if one is not there, how can they be blamed for something, unless it explicitly happens because they are not there. I then continue on this tangent with &quot;Yes you can read up on it after it has happened, but that doesn&#39;t help if a decision is needed then and there.&quot; before realizing it was indeed a tangent and deciding to shelve it away for later.<br><br>I make some comment about needing groundwork before we are able to continue, in which I was talking about if we were to redo things to do with how we handle bullying, nothing more or less. Then I make my other point that I think still applies (and shows that even on 5 hours sleep and with some stressful things happening earlier in the day I can still make up intelligent comments).<br><br>&quot;We need to see past oldbie, middlebie, whatever. Just because they&#39;ve been around a while doesn&#39;t mean they can&#39;t be held responsible for what they&#39;ve done. If hS did something really rude and wrong I&#39;d want him to be held accountable for it (for example).&quot;<br><br>hS was just an example, it wasn&#39;t meant to be anything related to Scape&#39;s comments, it was merely because hS was the oldest-bie I could think of whose name (or shortened version thereof) I could spell relatively quickly. But it is a good point, sure respect your elders, but also remember that elders aren&#39;t always right, and that just because you&#39;ve been here longer than someone else doesn&#39;t make you more right, or more in the right than someone who hasn&#39;t been here as long. I mean look at me, I count as an oldbie (somehow), and yet in some ways still feel like I should be treated as more of a middlebie (and even newbie in some cases) than an oldbie. But that&#39;s just me I guess.<br><br><br>It was at this point I needed to go off to my lecture (Yay, deriving the Black Scholes formula). I then returned somewhere around 6:20pm (ish) and kinda lurked on Discord (as well as reading what had been said in my absence) by which point it&#39;d mostly died down.<br><br>So yeah, that&#39;s my side of things (in one giant post that I feel really sorry for anyone who has just read through it all. I&#39;m aware the grammar is probably atrocious, I&#39;m sorry). I&#39;m not going to try and say I was definitely in the right, or definitely in the wrong. For the most part I was trying to have a discussion about how to better the PPC and the Constitution to prepare against something like this happening again.<br><br>If that is wrong, ban me, but I refuse to just accept being nominated for a ban because I felt that this had pointed some glaring holes in our community that NEED to be fixed and thought I would say something about it. And whilst I am strongly tempted to nominate Desdendelle for a ban as well, I refuse to, partially because I feel like falling to that level is inherently wrong, and SHOULD NOT BE DONE. And also because I recognize his point of view, and likewise July&#39;s POV, I may not respect it, I may not like it, but I will defend to the death their right to say it.<br><br>Storme Hawk<br>Who would have posted this in half the time if their &#39;o&#39; key worked more than half the time. </p>

            <p>I&#39;ve been trying to stay out of this since I think it&#39;s a community issue and not a personal one, but I really can&#39;t anymore. <br><br>Yes, Tomash posted a screenshot he really shouldn&#39;t have.

I should&#39;ve asked Tomash to delete the screenshot to mitigate the damage done to July&#39;s privacy, but I didn&#39;t. I admit I made a mistake there, and one I hope not to make again. <br><br>That said, I don&#39;t believe what happened here was a witch hunt. A few people got overzealous (names don&#39;t occur to me) but emotions were running high and not everyone can keep their head when things get that way. <br><br>What I was asking for was contact information so that I could privately speak with July, and ask to see if she would consent to that screenshot being posted. This was to be done with private information redacted, in the event that the community as a whole discussed exactly what bullying constituted, given that &quot;harassment&quot; can be difficult to define. </p>

            <p>My first response to Ix&#39;s post was &quot;Something looks <i>way</i> off about this, I&#39;m staying out.&quot; And I planned to stay all the way out - I&#39;m so, so very tired of drama.<br><br>But there are significant parts of that log that specifically call for <i>punishment of July</i>. In fact, judging from this:<br><br>Alleb-Yesterday at 11:44 AM<br>This dialogue feels... unproductive. We&#39;ve basically just been saying &quot;this is bad, we need to change.&quot; So are we going to? What steps do we need to take to make sure there isn&#39;t another situation like this? What are we going to do? We&#39;re writers; our business is words. Right now, though, we need action.<br>Khryssty-Yesterday at 11:44 AM<br>Thank you.<br>Delta Juliette-Yesterday at 11:44 AM<br>Aye. I should be working.<br>Granz-Yesterday at 11:44 AM<br>And who do we take action against?<br>Alleb-Yesterday at 11:45 AM<br>JF, I think. Glarn is already gone.<br>Granz-Yesterday at 11:45 AM<br>So is she, mostly.<br>Alleb-Yesterday at 11:45 AM<br>True.<br>But we also need to lay down plans for future incidents.<br>Tomash-Yesterday at 11:46 AM<br>Isn&#39;t it mostly &quot;what&quot; do we take action against?<br>Alleb-Yesterday at 11:46 AM<br>This should be a catalyst for us.<br>SkarmorySilver-Yesterday at 11:46 AM<br>I don&#39;t know if there&#39;s anything we CAN do at this point, for anyone or to anyone.<br>Khryssty-Yesterday at 11:46 AM<br>It would be easier to just let the banhammers swing and get JF completely out of the picture before any more damage can be done.<br><br>Guys . . . that&#39;s almost the definition of a witch-hunt. &quot;This person is upset/something is wrong. We need to punish someone. Let&#39;s ban this person who we judge to be to blame.&quot; Tomash points out that the dialogue should be taking action against an action, not a person. But that bit there? Let&#39;s punish someone for this grievance? That&#39;s a witch-hunt. (Ironically, considering the last accusation of bullying, it&#39;s also very Foucaultian.) To say something cannot be called a witch-hunt because of &quot;the heat of the moment&quot; and &quot;emotions were running high&quot; is to ignore the nature of a witch hunt. . . which is, again, finding a scapegoat for a perceived problem, using emotional mob mentality. I also see nasty things being thrown at Huinesoron. Not as much at Neshomeh. I see Desdendelle, here, telling Iximaz that <i>withdrawing from a medication</i>, specifically one targeting the nervous system, is no excuse for lashing out. I&#39;m guessing he&#39;s never had to deal with withdrawal from an anti-psychotic. My point is, however, that &quot;emotions ran high&quot; is no excuse for grabbing the torches and pitchforks to run someone out of a community.<br><br>I can&#39;t even address the doxxing. We&#39;ve all played fast and loose with our own privacy over the years, when among people we trust with our identity. I have no words for how I feel seeing it rebound against someone.</p>

            <p>That&#39;s why my stance during the discussion had been to leave July out of the overall discussion.

            <p>Some observations and thoughts:<br><br>1. You lot decided to have one of Iximaz&#39;s posts deleted from the Board without her say-so and without bothering to tell her? I understand that the idea came from Aegis, who you understandably trusted to know Ix&#39;s mind, but still, that was not smart, and clearly added to the problem. I feel that should be openly acknowledged.<br><br>2. You&#39;re taking one person&#39;s feelings as hard evidence that the community is broken and everyone in it is a failure of a human being. That&#39;s really messed up. However much we like Iximaz and however serious her troubles are, she is just one person. Do not base your self-worth and your judgement of this group on one person&#39;s feelings. It&#39;s not fair to anyone, especially not Iximaz. How on Earth do you think it makes her feel to have the community fall apart because of something she said while undergoing a bad drug withdrawal? That&#39;s an incredible amount of pressure to put on her, and it&#39;s not fair.<br><br>I know you all care about Iximaz and want to help her, but please see my reply to Aegis <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=306564;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">here</a> about the necessity for Iximaz to be responsible for herself in order to be an empowered, well-functioning adult. We can be as supportive and attentive as you please, but if she doesn&#39;t tell us something is wrong, we are not to blame for not knowing. If she&#39;s not doing the work she needs to do to move past her trauma, nothing we can do will fix it. Do not take away her power by denying that.<br><br>3. Feelings are not facts. I just want to state that flat-out. <b>Feelings are not facts</b>, especially when you all are well aware that the person having those feelings is not of sound mind at the time. See above comment on the unfair amount of pressure that puts on Iximaz, who has enough to worry about without all of you going on a crusade if she says boo when she&#39;s high or detoxing. Taking her seriously does not mean unconditionally believing that everything she says is an accurate representation of reality.<br><br>3.5. I&#39;ll add here that I&#39;m not comfortable with the nightly sessions of hanging out with her in voice chat when she&#39;s taken her meds and ought to be trying to sleep. I was there for it a couple times, and I get it—I experienced a sense of bonding and freeing from inhibitions, which I enjoyed even as I felt kind of icky about it. However, I&#39;ll note that I also urged Iximaz to go to bed. Nobody can make her do that—I repeat that Iximaz is responsible for making her own choices—but might I suggest that we no longer enable her fighting her medication by participating in those sessions, should she return to Discord? We all need to be more responsible toward her, and this is one concrete way to start.<br><br>4. I suppose I should address what was said, or rather implied, about me. Yes, I advised Iximaz not to throw away what had been a very close friendship with July over <i>one stupid misunderstanding</i>. I think dropping July was an overreaction based on past trauma that was not relevant to the situation, and I stand by that. I will not support allowing trauma to run anyone&#39;s life unchecked, forever.<br><br>I also think that, if you can understand and forgive Iximaz&#39;s issues, you should also be capable of understanding and forgiving July&#39;s. She was not just &quot;tired&quot;; she had worked a grueling 22-hour military shift, and I daresay she was in fact <i>triggered</i> by something that felt, to her, similar to a past trauma she went through with the IRC. In keeping with not letting trauma run our lives, however, she realized she had done wrong, regretted it, and repented. Maybe Iximaz had legitimate reasons for being unable to process that at the time, but none of the rest of you do now.<br><br>5. The witch-hunt was, in fact, a witch hunt. Someone said &quot;we should DO something!&quot;, someone else said &quot;yeah! who are we gonna punish?&quot;, and y&#39;all decided it was July you wanted to burn to set a precedent for the future. Yes, there was talk about getting her side, but it&#39;s pretty clear that at least some of you had already made up your minds. Des was the only person who spoke up to defend her, and you disregarded him.<br><br>6. There&#39;s been some sentiment floated about how the oldbies defend July because it&#39;s the status quo or something? And how we give her a pass because she&#39;s seen as an authority? That&#39;s such BS. I can&#39;t speak for anyone else because we are not a hive mind, but for myself, I defend July because I know her, I trust her, and she&#39;s been a good friend to me. As such, I also <i>call her</i> on her behavior when I think it&#39;s wrong. You don&#39;t always see it because I communicate with her privately, especially since she&#39;s not on the Board as much these days (and who can blame her when half the community is just waiting for any excuse to string her up?), but if you want to go and look at the thread surrounding Ix&#39;s falling out with her again, I believe you will see me doing just that. Put that in your pipe and smoke it.<br><br>I&#39;m sure there&#39;s more I wanted to say, but I haven&#39;t had breakfast yet. Maybe more will come to me later. I think those are the most important points I wanted to hit, anyway.<br><br>All in all, the main problem I see here is that enough of you have wound yourselves so tightly around Iximaz with your concern for her feelings that you&#39;ve given her the power to destabilize the whole community. This is dysfunctional and absurd. Please unwind yourselves so that she can have a more normal relationship with the group and so that we can all return to being individuals with our own normal, non-Iximaz-related agendas.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>1) <i>Sweet Ghezen,</i> was that a mistake. We decided to delete some of the posts she made in chat too and I was the mod who carried that out.

            <p>1) That was a mistake. I trusted Aegis. His reasons (he wanted to mitigate the damage when Ix&#39;s withdrawal ended (he thought it&#39;d be the next morning)) sounded good at the time. It turned out that the deletions were the wrong thing to do, and I regret my panicked involvement.<br><br>2) When I initially heard the complaints several days before they were raised on the Board, I felt they couldn&#39;t be entirely accurate, but I trusted Iximaz enough to try and look in to them. My actions while doing so (see my reply to hS elsewhere) probably made things worse. I realize now that she had never spoken out about the things she was complaining of, publicly or otherwise. It took me a long time and several missteps to realize that I was hearing an extremely skewed interpretation of events and that no one else know anything about how Iximaz felt. I had a gut feeling something was off about what I was hearing, but I didn&#39;t want to dismiss it because of my frinedship. I&#39;m sorry for all the trouble I caused with my half-hearted investigations and crusades.<br><br>I didn&#39;t really understand what had happened to Iximaz and what I (and she) needed to do that would be actually helpful.<br><br>3) I tried to not unconditionally believe what I was hearing without completely ignoring it. I didn&#39;t realize what was going on, especially since I didn&#39;t know about the mood swings caused by the new meds until <i>after</i> I&#39;d heard Ix&#39;s thoughts on the community.<br><br>3.5) Good point.<br><br>4) Nesh, I completely understand your actions, and I think they were the right thing to do given the circumstances I am now more aware of. I thought ill of you without all the facts, and I shouldn&#39;t have done that.<br><br>5) There was a witchhunt. I&#39;m ashamed that I threw fuel onto the fire by posting what I did. I hope that the remainder of the record shows that I didn&#39;t want to blame or punish July for that sort of thing, but I worry I was not clear about this at the time.<br><br>In general, Neshomeh, your comments on this situation and how it has been handled have been extremely helpful to me. I realized that I made a lot of mistakes in how I reacted to what Iximaz was doing and saying, and I believe I have learned from what you and others have been saying on the board so that I will be less unintentionally damaging in the future.<br><br>I admit I may have, as you said, wound myself too tightly around Iximaz&#39;s feelings, and done some very bad things because of it. Can I be forgiven?</p>

I&#39;ve seen your chat logs now.<br><br>Who wants to help me count the ways this is a horrifying post? Let&#39;s start!<br><br>1/ Tomash posted a private conversation between two people who were not him, without permission from either of them.<br><br>2/ Tomash posted about me, discussing my actions in a place where I have made it very clear I will not go. Talking about people behind their backs is explicitly called out in the PPC Constitution.<br><br>3/ Tomash misstated, if not flat-out lied about, my reaction. <a href="http://s66.photobucket.com/user/TangledWebs/media/Tomash2.png.html">Here&#39;s the entire conversation concerning that picture</a>; I received a reply from Iximaz which I have not shown, but never an answer from Tomash.<br><br>4/ <b>Tomash chose to post July&#39;s full name and face in a public place, where there is a permanent record, without her knowledge or consent.</b><br><br>I&#39;m looking desperately for anyone objecting to this.

Tell me why it&#39;s okay for a moderator to publically post someone&#39;s real identity in the course of resolving an argument. Tell me why you - and I make it at least a dozen of you who were there - are perfectly fine with something that can be linked to July&#39;s real name, home, family, job, <i>everything</i>... being publically splashed across the internet in front of people who are busy saying how abusive she is.<br><br>Tell me.

            <p>I have no saying on the matter, nor do I have anything that would in any way, shape or form justify Tomash&#39;s idea. I will not deny that my personal problems with July led me to be a part of this conversation, however nowhere in the logs you see me saying that her real name and face should be made public.<br><br>Two days ago, a certain somebody (to whom I am still thankful) gave me few good arguments as to why narrowing down JulyFlame as the sole source of PPC peer abuse was not the right path to take. Everyone at that time in Discord was concerned for Iximaz, true, but it&#39;s evident that <s>they</s> we should have focused on the issue as it was whole, not just what one person <i>could</i> have been guilty of. For that approach, I was ready to offer my apologies to JulyFlame (and not because Des said so), however doing so would only worsen the already hanging-on-a-thread relationship we have, as it was evident by my IWD post. Therefore, even if I regret voicing my opinion at the time, I can&#39;t bring myself to apologise to JulyFlame directly.<br><br><br>However, I would like to address one of the things you mention here, hS. <br><br>&quot;<i>I&#39;m looking desperately for anyone objecting to this. I&#39;ve found one &quot;I&#39;m not sure about posting the image&quot;, one &quot;you should probably censor July&#39;s name and face&quot; (note: future tense, not past&quot;... and one &quot;If July really has been verbally abusive, why protect her?&quot;</i>&quot;<br><br>It actually goes a little more than those three (well, two, since the last one isn&#39;t really an objection) sentences. You can see the logs below in my reply to Des&#39;s ridiculousness, but just to bring them out once again what I managed to find:<br><br>&quot;<i>Actually, in a way it is part of exactly the can of worms we&#39;re about to open. <b>But I agree with not putting the convo on board.</b></i>&quot;<br><br>&quot;<i><b>You should probably censor July&#39;s name and face.</b></i>&quot;<br><br>&quot;<i><b>If July wanted her real name known on the board, she would go by it.</b></i>&quot;<br><br>&quot;<i>We could quote the conversation.<br><b>Instead of using the screenshot.</b></i>&quot;<br><br>&quot;<i>I agree that <b>showing face and real name is not cool and disrespectful.</b> (...)</i>&quot;<br><br>&quot;<i>And IMHO, <b>putting that chat screencap in public view would be extremely disrespectful</b> to all parties involved, which won&#39;t help anybody&#39;s case.</i>&quot;<br><br><br><br>As you can see, the objection was there. Not everyone present in the conversation was perfectly okay with doing this. </p>

            <p>I doubt I can speak for anyone else, but I personally had no idea that the Discord channel was as public as the Board - the invite-based nature led me to think that only those who were invited to the channel at all would see it. I should&#39;ve known that this could potentially include everyone who&#39;s ever been on the channel should they hop in and scroll up to when the conversation was happening.<br><br>As I noted yesterday, I did speak to Aegis about not posting the screencap on the Board, but in hindsight I should&#39;ve taken offense to it being put up on the Discord  in the first place or anywhere that could be seen by anyone online for that matter, even other community members. Again, my deepest apologies go to everyone involved, and I guarantee that I&#39;ll be more vigilant regarding these kinds of acts in the future.</p>

            <p>First: you are absolutely correct. This isn&#39;t acceptable, especially from a moderator. It&#39;s illegal, and I really think Tomash should have his mod powers stripped from him because of it.<br><br>The conversation, though? That&#39;s evidence. Tomash doing something stupid in the heat of the moment <i>does not</i> and <i>should not</i> absolve July of her alleged offence against Iximaz.<br><br>I also note I don&#39;t see a witch hunt in the logs. I see people asking for July&#39;s testimony. That&#39;s an informal trial unfolding as it should - trying to get all sides before passing judgement.<br><br>You know, it would probably be a good idea to institute a rule not to post while angry and/or extremely tired, just to avoid situations like those July&#39;s apparently prone to. Angry posts often give offence that isn&#39;t intended, and a rule banning it would protect the more fragile members of the community.<br><br>Now, it&#39;d be good to get back to the important conversation of <i>what are we going to do to stop this from happening again</i>.

            <p>Looking back, my actions regarding that screenshot were completely unacceptable. JulyFlame, I apologize for leaking that information about you. It absolutely should not have happened. Iximaz, I apologize for dragging things into the light without consulting you (or July, for that matter). I have removed the screenshot in question from the Discord.<br><br>I posted in the interest of allowing the community to be fully aware of the circumstances surrounding Iximaz&#39;s departure, so that we could learn from them. I made a huge mistake in the process of doing this, and, again, I apologize. The only possible mitigation for my actions in this matter is that I did not know whether Iximaz was alive when I made that post, and I was angry and scared. <br><br>Huinesoron, during that email conversation, I was following up on a version of Iximaz&#39;s departure post I had heard a few days earlier, which included accusations of specific groups of people being uncaring. I didn&#39;t want to say what I was looking in to for fear of a backlash. During that conversation, it became clear that you didn&#39;t know the extend of July&#39;s actions at the time or how they had affected Iximaz. When I sent you the image in question, I sought to inform you. I interpreted your final reply as dismissing the validity of Iximaz&#39;s perception of events, that is, as claiming that she should not have felt harassed by those events. If this wasn&#39;t what you meant to say, I apologize for significantly misinterpreting you.<br><br>You have not received an answer from me because I have not had time to compose it in between traveling and dealing with the present situation.<br><br>I brought you up in that message because, again, I wanted everyone to know what had happened so that things could be improved. I realize that I was talking behind your back, and I apologize for that.</p>

            <p>July is a human being whom I happen to trust and respect a great deal, despite, I feel it relevant to note, having personally fallen out with her in the past. She&#39;s not perfect, but none of us are. We all have our issues, and none of us deserves to be treated as an acceptable target whenever something goes wrong. She has feelings, too, and it is not acceptable to tread on them with impunity.<br><br>I can&#39;t let this go unsaid: Iximaz is a wonderful person whose presence we value, and they do deserve to be taken seriously. However, we cannot properly do that without also bearing in mind that their mental illness, and sometimes side-effects of the treatment for it, means that they are not always 100% rational. Let us strive not to fall into the trap that turns understanding and accepting into enabling. This is as much for their sake as for ours as a community. It doesn&#39;t help anyone to encourage them to persist in destructive behaviors (internally or externally directed), and we can&#39;t be bending over backwards and changing the very structure of our community every time something goes wrong with someone&#39;s meds. This <i>is</i> a pattern at this point, and I would rather not see it play out again if we can avoid it.<br><br>Just to be clear, I don&#39;t mean this as a criticism of Iximaz. I state that they have a mental illness not as a slur, merely as a fact. I mean only to encourage a deeper understanding of their issues and more responsible behavior toward them on the community&#39;s part.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I agree with most of what everyone&#39;s said, and I suppose I&#39;m replying to this not to attack anyone&#39;s argument but to mull over some mixed feelings on the matter. I disagree that July isn&#39;t a bully, I&#39;ve seen and experienced her acting downright viciously to people with little or no justification and expecting everyone to act like it&#39;s fine. There&#39;ve been problems like this for years. She kicks people around with impunity and it somehow gets treated as bad when people shoot back.<br><br>That said, all of those actions have been ages ago, I&#39;ve not seen July around in ages nor do I know if any of that still applies. I also know nothing of the incident Ix cited to speak as to what happened, since I wasn&#39;t present, but here&#39;s the important thing:<br><br><i>None of what I just said justifies doxxing somebody.</i> The moment we look for &quot;justified&quot; targets for leaking names, faces, personal conversations etc., where does it end? Anyone can justify anything if they try hard enough and whatever feelings I have about the people involved, that&#39;s unacceptable, especially when somebody isn&#39;t around to speak in their own defence. That should really be as clear as day. Whatever we think about whomever, whatever the discussion being had, we should still be bound by common decency.<br><br>Posting the screenshot at all was unacceptable, that should be the end of it. Now, as far as witch hunts, I again have mixed feelings. I feel the accusations of a witch hunt, beyond what Tomash posted, don&#39;t really have much basis in fact, <i>but</i> as I said repeatedly in the chatlog, there seemed to be a lot of emphasis on punishing July where I honestly felt it was irrelevant to the more important discussion at hand. If we&#39;re talking about improving community standards and whatnot, that seems like a discussion that should be had without inextricably tying it with one specific spat between two PPCers. Aegis wanted to just talk to July privately, much like I was given the opportunity to speak on the matter of Brink in the chatlog, and that&#39;s fine. Overall, however, I feel it&#39;s more constructive to discuss next steps and where we go from here than going after someone who isn&#39;t really even still around.</p>

            <p>We need to be less reluctant to punish wrongdoers. I know I always want to think the best of everyone, and I think that the community in general gives too much benefit of the doubt, even when it isn&#39;t deserved. We need to act more quickly -- don&#39;t get me wrong, we need to treat people as innocent until proven guilty, but we need to act immediately once we get proof. I agree with what was said below: our ban votes are too long.<br><br>First step to take: we Discord mods need to be quicker to kick. I know no one likes punishing people we know, but this needs to happen, and kicks are pretty temporary.<br><br>However, we should stop having a freely available, eternal Discord invite on the wiki. This would require us to invite each newbie and returnbie separately, but would mean that kicked members would have to PM a mod to get back in, allowing the mods to impose cool-down periods/bans. These would not be unilateral actions by one mod: if one person was being unreasonable, the person being unfairly banned could contact a different mod and get back in. <br><br>--Key has lots of thoughts, this is just a start</p>

            <p>Firstly: we need some kind of moderator.<br><br>If someone&#39;s being bullied, how can they get help? What can they do? Every method of bringing the community&#39;s attention to this kind of thing involves posting something publicly - where the bully can see it. There&#39;s no safe, private communication that a victim can use to get help.<br><br>I would suggest a few trusted members of the community become that safe space. If someone feels victimised, they can contact one of those people directly. That way, the burden is off the victim - the mod (or whatever title you give them) can review and collect evidence (through forwarded emails, or being given access to the Google Doc, or whatever), and then they can be the one to present it to the community at large.<br><br>I&#39;m also not really convinced that the entire community really needs a vote. We need clear guidelines about what punishment goes with what offence, and if we make those clear enough, a simple look at the evidence should be enough for the mod(s) to declare the punishment. Certainly, the evidence should be posted on the Board for all to review, and there may be some debate as to what level applies, but the final decision should be delegated to avoid the lengthy, time-wasting votes that we usually have.<br><br>But that isn&#39;t the thing that should happen first. <br><br>The community has been failing its members. Ix is the third person I&#39;ve seen name JulyFlame as the perpetrator of bullying. July has driven at least three people from the community with her(?) behaviour. The first thing to do is decide what to do about <i>her</i>.</p>

            <p>It makes sense to me to take the burden of collecting evidence off the victim, and it seems like a natural direction for Discord at least -- we already have a mod channel where we log warnings given (mostly for language, etc.). It will also lend credibility to the victim: having accusations presented by a neutral third party would reduce the temptation to excuse the perpetrator&#39;s behavior.<br><br>In Discord, private messaging is simple, and I&#39;m in favor of mods providing their emails (mine&#39;s clickable on this post). <br><br>I also propose that moderators be made to run for re-election fairly regularly, so that they have to do a good job if they want to keep the position. We&#39;d need an impeachment process, too.<br><br>Having mod powers contingent upon re-election would also make me feel better about the idea of having the mods decide on bans -- which would definitely streamline a process which could use some streamlining.<br><br>. . .what this adds up to seems to be changing the PPC from a direct democracy to a representative democracy.

            <p>However, as it stands now, who would we choose? The PGs? Ignoring current events and questions, I&#39;m pretty sure they&#39;re not chosen because of their finely-tuned moral compasses. They&#39;re chosen because they can look at somebody&#39;s work and determine, well, whether or not said person is ready to write for the PPC. Unfortunately, however, they&#39;re basically the highest authority figure we have around right now, so if we wanted to make the position equivalent with previously existing structures, that is who would get the job.<br><br>Also, there is the question of qualifications. What makes somebody good for the job? How do they prove they fulfill those requirements? And, of course, what do we do when somebody looks to meet them, but falls short in practice? As I believe you mentioned an impeachment process in Discord and it might as well be brought here, what on your thoughts on how that would work?</p>

            <p>Frankly there are more questions than answers at this point, but here&#39;s a few thoughts from how the Discord seemed to be leaning:<br><br>* Impeachment would be carried out by community vote. A member of the community with a grievance would state their grievance in a board post and present their evidence, and there would be a voting and discussion period opened to the community (1-2 weeks?) where it is determined whether or not the grievance merits removal, or possibly some other sanction.<br><br>* Moderators would be either newly selected, or empowered PGs.<br><br>* Moderators would not get a vote in impeachment proceedings, for reasons relating to potential conflicts of interest.<br><br>* I jokingly suggested we dispense with the idea of democracy and just appoint hS king of the PPC, but I don&#39;t think anyone would like that.<br><br>As for your other questions, I&#39;ll have to come back to this. The traits and skills that make a good moderator are obvious. The process to select and prove them, not so much.</p>

            <p>Data Junkie mentioned July&#39;s bullying, though. So did the troll. The part about people being driven out was my interpretation of something that came up a while ago, though I believe Tray-Gnome&#39;s name was brought up specifically. I can go digging, if you like.</p>

            <p>They are, in order, a) a person who nearly got banned for abusive behaviour and then threw themselves out of the Board after seeing that their bad behaviour isn&#39;t welcome, b) a troll and c) a person who left the PPC after abusing hS and Nesh, returned to poke at sensitive things and throw names around, and left afterwards.<br>I&#39;m inclined to think that this sorta accusation is baseless.

            <p>An IP links to a specific computer. It can change, that&#39;s certainly possible, but... 170-odd of Data Junkie&#39;s 217 posts came from that address. Only 4 of 17 of Orwell&#39;s did. But one Data Junkie post came <i>after</i> the Orwell posts. It seems unlikely that a) the IP would switch and then switch back, and b) it would do so right when Data Junkie left, then jump back just in time for them to make one more post.<br><br>It is conceivable that Data Junkie posted from a single non-home location 9/10ths of the time, and that Orwell-aka-Toroll - a troll who has talked an awful lot about Data Junkie, and made similar attacks on the community to them - happens to live nearby and use the same location, but being a very etiquette-conscious flamer troll, hasn&#39;t ever mentioned this.<br><br>But it seems unlikely.

            <p>IP addresses are owned by ISPs, and are therefore usually connected to <i>routers</i>*, not cleint-end computers.

            <p>This is probably one of the more relevant times y&#39;all could be talking about this, given that I&#39;ve got an ethical hacking midterm tomorrow, and IP address stuff is important for that.<br><br>So, IP addresses. The general point is that computers need a way to refer to other computers located on a network. A name is nice for humans but rather useless for network people, because there&#39;s basically no correlation between how similar two names are and how to get to them. So, everyone on the public Internet gets a number to identify them so they can talk and be talked to called an IP address. Every computer keeps some notion of how to reach any other IP address (your machine knows that it can get to anywhere from your router, your router knows that either your ISP can do it or you&#39;re looking for another device on the network, and your ISP has a big routing table of IP address ranges and who it has to go through to reach them)<br><br>There&#39;s two versions of the Internet Protocol (IP), and I&#39;ll discuss IPv4 first. With IPv4, your number is 32 bits long, and usually written aaa.bbb.ccc.ddd, where the individual fields are 8 bits long (because four numbers between 0 and 255 are easier to remember than one really big number. <br><br>When folks were first designing the Internet, they sure weren&#39;t expecting there to be 2^32 (minus a bit) computers on it. Problems were beginning to arise a while back, so a &quot;solution&quot; was devised. Your ISP only gives you one IPv4 address. &quot;But, Tomash!&quot; you object, &quot;I have a computer and a phone and a smart microwave all on the same connection.&quot; This is where the nasty evil hack comes in. Your router only gives you a private IP address, usually of the form 192.168.X.Y. When your computer sends out data labeled &quot;From: 192.168.1.5, port [high number], To: 45.56.119.192, port 80&quot; (that&#39;ll hit the Board&#39;s server), your router secretly rewrites that to say &quot;From: [your public IP address], port [other high number], To: 45.56.119.192, port 80&quot;. Then, when the Board sends back its reply labeled &quot;From: 45.56.119.192, port 80, To: [your public IP address], port [other high number]&quot;, your router remembers that [other high number] corresponds to [high number] on 192.168.1.5 (that&#39;d be your computer), and so it re-writes the packet back so your computer never notices the deception. This has the drawback (and, if you&#39;re a person who writes terrible insecure code I&#39;m looking at you device manufacturers, feature) that your computer can&#39;t have a conversation initiated with it, which is a bit annoying for, among other things, multiplayer games and voice calling. For practical purposes, this means that sharing an IPv4 address with someone means you&#39;re in the same house or coffeeshop (unless you count, say, all the mobile phones in Qatar, which all share an IP)<br><br>Mostly, people didn&#39;t mind this packet re-writing business, even though it causes annoying problems. But the Internet kept growing. Several other things were done to save on IPv4 addresses (a big one is that, when you connect to a website, you have to tell the website its own name, so that the same server/IP can serve multiple domain names). However, we&#39;re still running out of IPv4 addresses, and in fact, we&#39;re more or less out at this point.<br><br>Because 32 bits wasn&#39;t enough, we moved to 128 bits. Sort of. An IPv6 address, unless it&#39;s abbreviated, is aaaa:bbbb:cccc:dddd:eeee:ffff:gggg:hhhh, where each of the alphabet groups is written in base 16. This is more than enough addresses, we swear. This is even expected to be true once it gets mentioned that, right now, you don&#39;t get one IPv6 address from your ISP, you get 2^64 of them! (like, you, personally, if your ISP is with the program, can hand out an IPv4 Internet&#39;s worth <i>of IPv4 Internets</i>). There&#39;s a nice fiddly mechanism for how the eeee through hhhh bits get determined, but suffice to say, if it has an IPv6 address, it&#39;s directly on the Internet again. No more connection rewriting. Yay!<br><br>For practical purposes, two IPv6 address are in the same house/coffeeshop/... if the first <i>four</i> groups of numbers (and A through F are numbers, whoever told you otherwise?) match.</p>

            <p>I was on the record at the time as thinking the timing of the appearance of Orwell (we were discussing Data Junkie&#39;s ban) was, if you&#39;ll forgive the WWII-era phrasing, &quot;too velvety-arsed and Rolls-Royce for me&quot;.

            <p>Some of the articles of the Constitution (specifically 1 and 10.5) say that bullying will not be tolerated. That&#39;s all they say. I mean, 10.5 does say that persistent rule-breakers will be asked to leave the community, but that&#39;s not enough. Nowhere in the Constitution is a procedure given for exactly what to do. <br><br>What I&#39;m trying to say is that we need an addition to the Constitution detailing <i>exactly</i> what we should do if a situation like this comes up again. For instance: we could add that we won&#39;t just let a situation subside; a rule that says we continue discussing about said situation until a decision is reached, no matter how long that takes. Something like that.<br><br>Final point: we desperately need an article that somehow, someway, keeps us from being complacent about things and just letting them slide after some time.</p>

            <p>Clearly, I made mistakes in my handling of this entire situation.<br><br>One thing I would like to note is that, when I sent those emails, I did not have the full story. I only had Iximaz&#39;s side of the story, since I didn&#39;t know what had happened privately during all that. Something felt off about Iximaz&#39;s descriptions of how the PGs (including you) were painted in her version, but I took the accusations seriously enough to look in to them by talking to you.<br><br>Before talking to you, I asked Iximaz if I could do that, since I would be writing an email going off the details of a private conversation, and I didn&#39;t want to betray her trust. I included her on the email because I thought the reply would be something she needed to see. I didn&#39;t think through  the harm to Iximaz of a reply saying that you didn&#39;t think it was serious, and for that, Iximaz, I&#39;m sorry. (For the record, I interpreted your initial reply as indicating that you didn&#39;t know the full extent of the situation, and that you didn&#39;t think it was serious based on the information you had.)<br><br>I also included Iximaz in that conversation on the advice of Aegis, who I trusted to know the right way to handle this situation. Given Nesh&#39;s reply to Aegis below, I acknowledge that this trust may not be as fully deserved as I used to think.<br><br>Throughout a lot of this, I was taking Iximaz&#39;s version of events extremely seriously. It has become clear to me that my actions over the last week have been guided by misinterpretations and misunderstandings, both of Iximaz&#39;s state of mind and potential reactions to events and of the actions and intentions of many of my fellow PPCers (including especially Iximaz and you). <br><br>Because of my mistakes and failures, I have hurt Iximaz. I certainly didn&#39;t want to do that, and, Ix, I hope you can forgive me for whatever part of the blame falls to me. I have also taken actions that have harmed the community as a whole, and JulyFlame specifically. I hope that I can make amends.<br><br>I will strive to do better in the future.</p>

            <p>So, I&#39;ve been here on and off for about a month and a half now. More recently, thanks to my stressful job and personal life, I&#39;ve been off. But, I have really enjoyed being here, and i have decided that I would definitely like to write some PPC of my own. So, I humbly request permission to do so, and include the agent profiles I&#39;ve written up. If you guys could check over them and see that everything is okay, that&#39;d be much appreciated. <br><br>--------------------------<br><br>Agent Conrad Harke:<br><br>Age - 25<br><br>Species - Human<br><br>Gender - Male <br><br>Home Continuum - Warhammer 40,000<br><br>Appearance - Conrad has short jet black hair, pale skin and and blue eyes. His usual outfit consists of black military fatigues, a pair of leather Guard-issue boots, ident-tags and a white undershirt. The patch identifying him as an agent is on the right sleeve of his tunic. Thanks to his universe being originally from the UK, he has a pronounced British accent, though has never been there himself. <br><br>Personality - Conrad spent seven years serving in one of the most discipline-heavy armies in the multiverse, and it shows. Anyone above him gets called &#39;sir&#39; or &#39;ma&#39;am&#39; whether they like it or not. He spends his free time either binge watching for research, working out in the gym or cleaning his gear. What sense of humour he has left is darker than your average Frankie Boyle routine. When on missions, he tends to be very focused to the point of being taciturn, and off mission, he is usually quite quiet, with any speech kept short and to the point. It takes a lot to get him angry, but when he does, revenge tends to be short but painful/humiliating.<br><br>History - Originally hailing from the grimdark universe of Warhammer 40,000, Conrad joined the PPC in 2014 after he fell into a Warp portal during a campaign against Chaos cultists and ended up in HQ.  After being talked down from opening fire on several unlucky agents, he was recruited and took to the field eighteen months ago as a Floater. His previous life has served him well in his time at HQ, with his training as an Imperial Guardsman preparing him for working in Word Worlds, and his upbringing as a hiver lets him feel a little more at home in the corridors of HQ than most. While he has mostly adapted to the 21st Century, and understands most of the pop culture he works with, more obscure references and concepts still pose a bit of a problem. <br><br>Abilities - Conrad has had military training, and even if it wasn&#39;t very good or safe training, he still picked up some useful skills. He can provide basic medical aid if an agent gets injured in the field, has bushcraft knowledge and is skilled with both melee and ranged weapons, although he prefers the latter. He was a qualified sharpshooter in the Imperial Guard, but as he himself is quick to point out, he is no sniper. <br><br>Favourites/Lust Objects - Conrad has no lust objects, but he does have a soft spot for the entire crew of Serenity, as well as a great respect for Max Rockatansky. <br><br>--<br><br>Agent Elly Ruskowski:<br><br>Age - 22<br><br>Species - Human <br><br>Gender - Female<br><br>Home Continuum - Real World<br><br>Appearance - Elly is Caucasian, with dyed red hair and brown eyes. She usually wears blue jeans, a t-shirt of some description, trainers (sneakers) and a brown leather jacket with her Department of Floaters patch sewn on, along with a single nose stud. She speaks with an American accent, but likes to impersonate others, with varying degrees of success. <br><br>Personality - She has a tendency to get very excited when meeting characters she admires, and very angry when they&#39;re messed with, especially when her favourite shippings are broken up. This anger is usually worked out on mission with weapon practice or off mission with video games, though outside of missions in her favourite fandoms, she&#39;s usually either pretty calm and easygoing, or very hyperactive if something takes her personal interest, and especially if Conrad hasn&#39;t seen or read something she thinks is important. She swears a lot, but more as part of her everyday vocabulary than any real anger. In contrast, when she is in a rage, she tends to get much quieter, and use less explicit language.<br><br>History - A twenty-two year old from Colorado, Elly had a normal childhood, with good parents and little to worry about except exams, all very middle class. During her high school years, she was a civilian watcher, which lead to her being given the opportunity to join the PPC, a choice she now regrets. She has been working with Conrad in the Department of Floaters for around eighteen months. <br><br>Abilities - Elly isn&#39;t very good with ranged weapons, and generally prefers using swords and knives on missions where possible. She&#39;s a natural speedreader, which lets her pick up details from a Word World quicker than most would. Her encyclopedic knowledge of both pop culture and fandoms also comes in handy. She usually handles the exorcisms and charge lists. <br><br>Favourites/Lust Objects - Both of Elly&#39;s come from the MCU, and are Black Widow and the Winter Soldier/Bucky, respectively. However, she also has quite a special place in her heart for Ed and Ein of Cowboy Bebop fame. <br><br>--<br><br>RC #819: Some RC&#39;s are old enough to have seen many agents come and go over the unknown amount of time since HQ was set up. Old enough to have acquired quirks, non-standard design features, even personalities in a way. RC #819 is one of these. <br><br>It is laid out like a small apartment, with a central hallway leading to the door, and two rooms on each side. On the left as you come in are the two bedrooms, each with room for a bed, desk, shelves and not much more. On the right, there is a tiny bathroom with a shower, sink and toilet, as well as a lounge area. The lounge contains a television and Xbox, a mid-range desktop gaming computer, a well-loved sofa and the console.<br><br>As stated previously, #819 is old, and has been lived in by agents almost continuously since the mid 1990&#39;s, and more infrequently even earlier in the PPC&#39;s history. It shows. The amenities are all mostly modern, but small problems remain. Small unidentifiable scratches and marks are dotted around the RC, some of which look disturbingly like blood. The door has over a dozen names stenciled on it in white paint, and crossed out in red. The console took several bullets around the time of the Fanfic Explosion, and the alarm system is irreparable. Unfortunately, some well-meaning soul patched in an 2003-era iPod, which means that instead of the classic &quot;BEEEEEEEEEP!!!&quot;, Conrad and Elly get Dies Irae from Verdi&#39;s Requiem blasted at them at one hundred and twenty decibels whenever a mission comes through. <br><br>Despite this, it is fairly homely. The lights aren&#39;t too bright, the electrical sockets all work, the beds are comfy and it somehow never seems as far to the cafeteria as it does from other places in HQ. What more could a pair of Agents ask for?</p>

            <p>First, as Iximaz said, you&#39;re missing writing prompts, and a badfic you intend to spork, too. Everything else is here, so if you&#39;ve got &#39;em and just forgot to post them, I&#39;ll wait before giving a verdict. Otherwise, the writing samples are really the most important thing we need to see, so without them I will have to deny Permission for now.<br><br>In the meantime, comments on what you&#39;ve got:<br><br>1) Conrad. I know several people have standing concerns about agents from the 40k universe due to its grimdark nature, and I&#39;d like it of one or two of them weighed in. I don&#39;t personally see too much of that in Conrad&#39;s profile, but I am concerned about the &quot;short but painful/humiliating revenge&quot; bit. What does that actually mean in practice? Also, to a lesser degree, the dark sense of humor. Lots of agents indulge in a bit of black humor now and then, but given the 40k factor, how dark is dark here?<br><br>2) Elly. Mostly looks fine, but she regrets joining the PPC? Seriously, or jokingly? Cuz I&#39;m sure a lot of agents would moan about not knowing what they were getting into when they signed up, but most of them wouldn&#39;t quit if you paid them, either. Since they, er, don&#39;t get paid, it&#39;s really love and/or devotion that keeps most of them going.<br><br>3) RC 819. This is where I have the most serious concerns. First of all, if you read enough older spin-offs, you&#39;ll note that a standard RC back in the day was no bigger than a college dorm: one room and a closet, <i>maybe</i> a toilet if you&#39;re lucky. If this is an older RC, it was built to that design, and there&#39;s no way even the most dedicated reconstructionists force that into the two-bedroom apartment shape you describe.<br><br>I also object to the two-bedroom apartment RC on principle. I know there&#39;s precedent at this point, but that doesn&#39;t mean I have to like it. You&#39;re not supposed to spend <i>time</i> in your RC; it&#39;s just for crashing in during the few scant hours between missions. Also, HQ was originally built by sapient Flowers with little to no understanding of the needs of mammals. It just doesn&#39;t work for me, and it never will.<br><br>I&#39;m also not a huge fan of non-standard BEEPs, but heck, Dies Irae is cool. Not particularly funny, IMO, but oh well.<br><br>I actually like the thought you put into the RC&#39;s history, though. That&#39;s a welcome bit of added depth that I don&#39;t often see.<br><br>~Neshomeh, holding her PG hat at the ready.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the response, and I forgot about the writing samples. Besides, I&#39;ve decided that I should spend a little more time here before I start properly writing. As to your feedback, which is greatly appreciated: <br><br>Conrad:The short but painful/humiliating revenge would be something like pictures of Borat plastered all over your RC&#39;s door (That actually happened to someone in my dorm at uni) or your internet search history publicly displayed on noticeboards. Nothing physical, but very embarrassing and painful in a loss of face sort of way, since he&#39;s toned it down since becoming an agent. As to humour, think Frankie Boyle or Bill Hicks, but with less swearing. <br><br>Elly: The regret is mostly jokingly, though it hides a bit of doubt about if the PPC is a long-term option for her, since she pretty much chose it over higher education. She loves her job, but she can&#39;t see herself as an agent in ten years. <br><br>RC #819: I get where you&#39;re coming from, but I quite like the idea of an RC as a home. You&#39;re also right about the old model, so what do you think about it having been converted from a set of storage rooms. It seems like the Flowers would have built a cupboard bigger than an RC. </p>

            <p>As the title states, I would like to know if other people would be interested in a PPC scavenger hunt. The idea would be that someone (probably me, since I&#39;m proposing this) would come up with a list of things related to the PPC, and that anyone who wants to participate would try to find them. Whoever finds the most things wins.<br><br>The things related to the PPC would be items mostly from badfic, although the occasional item from good to mediocre fic would also be on the list. None of them would require going into NSFW or NSFB fic. For example:<br><ol>
<br><li> A mini with three or more letters added, deleted, or removed </li>
<br><li> An object of an impossible color </li>
<br><li> A Suvian reformed within their own fic </li>
<br>
</ol>
<br>As for finding the items, that would be accomplished by posting them in a thread made for the scavenger hunt. Two boarders wouldn&#39;t be able to use the exact same item, though using a different item from the same fic or even the same chapter would be fine, even for the same thing on the list. Also, legendary badfic (or possibly any fic linked on the PPC wiki?) would be forbidden because it would just be a race to post things on the board at that point.<br><br>I&#39;m fully open to any suggestions on this. I just want to know if this looks to be a good idea and if people are interested in participating.</p>

            <p>I&#39;d definitely be up for this. We&#39;d have to figure out a few rules, decide which sites are off limits (There&#39;s a few sites out there which while they would have most of the things on any given list, need brain bleach to enter, read and exit), set a start and end date and come up with some really interesting items for the list. </p>

            <p>I think we should be able to hunt across multiple fandoms and sites, but I like the time limit idea. It&#39;s too easy to just plunge into a glut of fifteen year old LOTR badfic Jay and Acacia could have taken on. Seven days seem a little restrictive to me, though. How about in the last month? </p>

            <p>First up, as you&#39;ve probably noticed (and the main reason this is a separate post), I&#39;ve changed my name. This has been something I&#39;ve been thinking of doing for almost 6 months now, in some ways I&#39;ve grown out of Storme Hawk, and in others I just prefer Novastorme. Also you can still contact me on <a href="mailto:stormehawk@gmail.com">stormehawk@gmail.com</a> and <a href="mailto:thestormehawk@gmail.com">thestormehawk@gmail.com</a>, my Novastorme gmail is full of spammy emails from various games I have and I&#39;m too lazy to change it. <br><br>Now, if you&#39;d asked me on Wednesday, or even Thursday, what doxxing was I&#39;d of honestly replied, &quot;no idea.&quot; Before the actions of the Discord made its way onto the Board I had no idea about it, that there was a law against it, or anything like that really. I mean it was always one of those unspoken rules in my other community, but I never ran into any problems with it there, although then again we didn&#39;t really do idle chatter. <br><br>I&#39;m saying this, not because I want to try and dodge some of the blame, or the &#39;disappointment&#39; or whatever we&#39;re calling it now, but to give you some idea of, perhaps, why I didn&#39;t try and stop it as much as I could have done. Not that I really could have done a lot sitting in my Uni library at the time if I&#39;m completely honest, although part of me is wondering where I would be in all this if I hadn&#39;t logged on to Discord and had simply concentrated on my work (my answer to that will come at a later point, probably not even in this post at all).<br><br>Still, I want to formally apologise to July. I tried not to get caught up in the witch hunt that occurred, not that I knew that that was what it was at that point in time. I tried to have some discussion surrounding the current rules, and in typing those out and through just generally not paying enough attention to the Discord I made the mistake of perhaps not sticking up for you, or your rights as much as I perhaps should have tried to do. I didn&#39;t realise what was fully going on, I didn&#39;t realise that sitting back and not really concentrating on it was not okay, hell I didn&#39;t even realise it was your full name at the top of the screenshot or your picture attached to your messages in it. But that doesn&#39;t excuse me, I should have realised that what was going on wasn&#39;t right, and as much as I wanted your side of things, just to look at and compare (for I always try and look at all sides of an argument before making a decision), I should of tried to stop what did happen from happening at all, and I should know from previous times that even in the pursuit of knowledge some things are inexcusable. <br><br>Ix, I&#39;m sorry. I can&#39;t really form anything else into words, or how I feel into words. Just know you&#39;re not alone, if you ever need to talk to someone (and this goes to everyone reading this as well), and I&#39;m around, let me know and I don&#39;t mind. I will listen and, if you want me to, I will help, I will contact and talk to whoever you want me to talk to, or I will keep what you want a secret to my dying breath (if it comes to that), I don&#39;t mind. <br><br>Novastorme, signing off<br>(Man it feels weird yet so nice to say that)<br></p>

            <p>I personally feel like they should be treated like the US Congress treats them.  They do not factor into an actual vote.  That&#39;s how you can have the Senate unanimously confirm a nomination with 92 votes instead of the actual unanimous 100.

            <p>Not that it changes the tally, but I definitely did not vote for a ban. <br><br>I think there&#39;s a difference between doxxing classically (spreading someone&#39;s identifying details publicly, with an intent to harass/get them attacked) and not editing someone&#39;s real name out of a screenshot in a place you thought was private, only to realize it wasn&#39;t private. <br><br>For that reason, I don&#39;t consider what Tomash did consistent with punishing someone for &quot;doxxing&quot;. </p>

            <p>I honestly think it&#39;s just part of the feeling of the chat. I certainly don&#39;t think of it as being &quot;as public&quot; as the Board, even though it clearly is. I don&#39;t know that I can really explain it, either, so I&#39;m aware this sounds absurd (and is a moot point, since Tomash is leaving for 2-3 months anyway), but a chat really does <i>feel</i> more private. </p>

            <p>It&#39;s been a week, and we&#39;ve seen 31 people vote, which is a large enough sample of the community to be representative (last few times I tried to count, the PPC had about 40 to 50 members). We also haven&#39;t seen &quot;too many&quot; abstains or calls to wait a bit, so that&#39;s not a validity issue either.<br><br>I personally feel that permabans need at least 2/3rds vote to stick. However, this was a vote on a temporary ban, so it&#39;s a lot less clear what the vote threshold should be. Then again, PPC votes are to a consensus, not a majority, and it&#39;s best to err on the side of caution with the sanctioning. So, I&#39;m going to decide that there was no clear consensus on my ban, but that there was a very clear trend in favor of it that can&#39;t be ignored.<br><br>Despite this uncertainty, <i>I</i> think I need to be banned for a bit, and there&#39;s no reason I can&#39;t be harsher on myself than the community is. I made a terrible mistake that caused serious harm to July. There need to be consequences for that, and I personally  don&#39;t feel punished enough by the apologies and the resignation.<br><br>Therefore, I&#39;m announcing my ban from the PPC for <b>2-3 months</b>. That is, until some point between May 23 and June 23 (I expect it&#39;ll be in early June) I won&#39;t be:<br>- Posting on the Board<br>- Present in the Discord<br>- Editing the wiki<br><br>I considered just muting myself on the Discord, but that felt like it would soften one of the parts of getting banned that feels bad, so I won&#39;t be doing that. <br><br>One exception: if I come up in the grievances thread next month, or if there is any voting, I&#39;ll be participating in those discussions. (well, also, I&#39;ll finish the discussion(s) I&#39;m currently involved in if they get continued, but not drag them out)<br><br>I&#39;ll stay available by email (clickable above) and by Discord PM (I&#39;m <code>Tomash#8833</code>) if anyone wants to keep in touch.<br><br>If the T-Board or archives have problems, please do contact me. I&#39;ll still be available to fix them.<br><br>As to the moderator vote, I&#39;m going to propose a result, which everyone should feel free to ignore. Of the 21 people who voted, 70% of them (15 / 21 is about 0.7) are opposed to mods, which is a strong indicator that the community as a whole isn&#39;t particularly keen on the idea. That means that the result is <b>no mods</b>.<br><br>In a thread below, <b>Maslab</b> and <b>Delta Juliette</b> appear to have been elected Discord mods by 11 votes and no objections. Since that&#39;s not a sanction, and it looks like everyone either supports this or doesn&#39;t care enough to object, I think we can declare that election concluded.<br><br>On the mutes, I don&#39;t think we have enough participation to <i>impose</i> that sanction. However, I think that the people whose mutes are being called for should consider voluntarily muting themselves for a while.<br><br>So, yeah, bye guys. Sorry for my part in all this mess.</p>

<li>No mods.<br><br>2. Nobody needs to be banned. But since we can&#39;t do nothing, let Tomash, Alleb, Granz and Khryssty be muted on Discord for three months. (I&#39;m not sure whether this is an exhaustive list of main offenders.) Let everybody else who has seen this screenshot and didn&#39;t ask to take it down be muted for at least one month. This is, even if you showed some concern about taking it to the Board without blurring the face and real name, you still get one month. I&#39;m so late because I tried to read through the log again and to decide who deserves two months, but I can&#39;t. It&#39;s difficult to follow the conversation and I probably don&#39;t get all the undertones; thus I can&#39;t really tell who contributed how much to the unhealthy atmosphere, and every decision I made would feel unjust. Now that you had time to think about it, may I just ask all of you to sort yourself into House Three-Months, House Two-Months, House One-Month and House Totally-Innocent? (This may be a mute point. Since I didn&#39;t see Des giving the Keys to anybody else, I have no idea what will happen to the Discord.)<br><br>3. Abstain.<br><br>HG</li>

<li>No Board mods. Between the Nameless Admin being able to change or take down posts if necessary (and deal with trolls and spambots and so on), and level-headed people in general stepping in when things get heated in the &#39;this is no longer a friendly debate&#39; sense (seriously, we&#39;ve had almost entirely polite <i>political debates</i>. In most cases, we&#39;re capable of not even <i>needing</i> someone to step in on the Board), I don&#39;t think mods are necessary nor do I see what they&#39;d really add. At most, it&#39;d be a tiny bit of extra authority for a level-headed person who&#39;s stepping in to tell people to go cool off, and since it&#39;d also come with a bunch more extra stress for that person/those people, it doesn&#39;t seem like a great trade-off. My vote is <b>no mods.</b><br><br>2. I am not touching this. I do not want to touch this. This entire affair disgusts me and I do not want to spend even more time trying (and mostly failing) to sort out what I think an appropriate response would be. At most (okay, I&#39;m touching it a little bit), I suppose I agree with Tomash (and a number of other people) that he should take a break for a bit. How long that break actually is, I&#39;ll let the rest of you decide. I support 2-3 months as the minimum, though I&#39;m not sure anything less than that has even been suggested (I stand corrected, there&#39;s 1 month in there too. I don&#39;t support 1 month; put me down as 2-3 minimum).<br><br>Actually, one more thing: there was a proposal a while back to mute some of the users who&#39;d been involved in the anti-July...&#39;discussion&#39; (and I&#39;m using that word loosely). That is, to mute them on the Discord for, I believe, 1-3 months, or maybe 1-2. I support that idea (at 1-2 months) for the people who were most involved--not for everyone, but for the people who were really spearheading it. Guys, you <i>need</i> to learn to take a step back and <i>think</i> for a bit when emotions are running high, <i>especially</i> your own. You need to learn to take a break and cool off. Even if that means actually saying &#39;I am not clear-headed right now and I&#39;m going to take a break and come back in a few hours/tomorrow. Please don&#39;t make any important decisions without me. Please take a step back yourselves if you feel your anger is clouding your judgement as well.&#39; If muting you will make you think about it and make the idea stick in your memory, I am all for it.<br><br>This also applies when you don&#39;t yet have a strong opinion of your own. Take a step back if you need to, read up on what&#39;s going on, get more information. Don&#39;t judge blindly based on one bit of information that you have no context for. Again, you can explicitly state that that&#39;s what you&#39;re doing: &#39;I don&#39;t have enough information about this yet, and I&#39;m going to step away from this discussion until I know more.&#39; Either that or call for more information for <i>everyone</i>. It doesn&#39;t hurt to learn more, and it doesn&#39;t hurt to reserve judgement until you do. Try it.<br><br>You are all adults or young adults (yes, I&#39;m including the teenagers in this). If you don&#39;t have this skill yet, you <i>need</i> to try to build it. This is a community of real people, even if many of us will never meet; and you need those skills both for here in the PPC (and in any other online community you will ever join) as well as in the real world, for your jobs and your lives and your friends and your families and potentially your SOs. <i>Learn how to take a step back and cool off in tense situations</i>. I promise you, <i>you need this skill</i>. We <i>all</i> need this skill. I strongly suggest you work on it, and that goes for everyone here who doesn&#39;t already have it, whether you were involved in this discussion or not. It&#39;s a very useful skill to have, and developing it is one way to guard against things like what happened last week.<br><br>Votes summed up: <b>Break or ban for Tomash for 2-3 months minimum. Mute the users who were most involved in the July...&#39;discussion&#39; for at least 1-2 months on the Discord server. Everyone, work on learning how to take a step back to cool off when emotions are running high. Also consider waiting for more information before judging a complex situation in the future.</b><br><br>3. The Discord. Hrm. Well, I agree with a few of the things that have been mentioned, and they range from serious to minor.<br><br>A. Yes <i>please</i> do a &#39;best of the Discord&#39; post (as proposed <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=306732;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">here</a>). Or maybe make it a blog on the wiki that gets linked to from the Board whenever a new post goes up. It could also be linked to from the wiki page called &quot;PPC Lounge,&quot; and if it&#39;s a post, the information should be archived and linked to there or else transferred onto the page. I think it&#39;s a great way to bridge the gap between Boarders and Discorders (both for Boarders who never go there and for Discorders who&#39;ve been away for a while and want to know what they&#39;ve missed). It&#39;s also a great way to share some fun things, and maybe even snippets of especially good RPs from time to time? This might actually work better as a collaborative Board post (one person starts it every, say, month, and other Discorders slowly or quickly add things to it. Please remember that if you want to share something that&#39;s a quote or an RP piece rather than just a general &#39;this is something that generally happens&#39;, you need to get the permission of everyone involved. In fact, do that anyway. Another idea for things to add to this: bits of some of the punversations. Again, with the permission of everyone involved). This could also be done in the format of putting the information from the Board post into a wiki blog post, which is then linked to on the &quot;PPC Lounge&quot; page. People could even take turns making the blog post, so that the responsibility doesn&#39;t all fall on one person.<br><br>B. I think hS has some good points in his <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=306819;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">&#39;About the Discord:&#39; post</a> below. I&#39;m just going to comment on the ones I either agree with completely or would modify slightly.<br><br>Case in point: I&#39;d modify the positive discussion a little, since I know how much easier it can be to express your opinion of a new mission in chat form: do that in the Discord if you like, but then <i>post it on the Board</i>. While it&#39;s very nice if the author happens to have a friend who hangs out in the Discord and will pass it on, it&#39;s really not the same as seeing the words yourself. So rephrase it, copy and paste what you yourself said, get a volunteer to compile a review from what several people have said/agreed with--and post it on the Board.<br><br>As for making decisions in the Discord...yeah. If it&#39;s a big, important decision, if it&#39;s even something like a big PPC canon question (that would, say, change the canon or add something major to it) that could use more than 1-2 answers from people who know what they&#39;re talking about, I&#39;d say put it on the Board. If it&#39;s a very emotional decision that isn&#39;t a personal, non-PPC related question (say, if you have a grievance or you&#39;re thinking of leaving or something and it&#39;s something you want to discuss publicly rather than talking only to the people or person involved in private or in private with someone willing to mediate there as well), bring it to the Board. Let it move slower, let it simmer, let people have time to weigh in and most importantly to <i>think</i> about it before they weigh in. Obviously some matters won&#39;t fall under this, and if you&#39;re only comfortable talking it through via DMs or group DMS as opposed to publicly in the Discord or publicly on the Board, keep it there. But if it&#39;s a big PPC-related decision, or something that you want a lot of hopefully well-thought out opinions on--bring it to the Board. I agree with hS that it won&#39;t solve everything--but it should certainly help in a lot of cases. And it also ensures that a, you get a mix of oldbies and newbies responding instead of just whoever happens to be on at the time, b, people who don&#39;t feel qualified to answer can leave it for someone else, and c, people who don&#39;t initially know how to answer get a chance to think it through and come up with something if they can.<br><br>C. I vote against closing the Discord entirely, whether short-term or long-term. I don&#39;t think that&#39;s necessary and I don&#39;t think it&#39;ll solve anything.<br><br>Discord votes summed up: <b>A &#39;best of the Discord&#39; post or blog post every month or so would be amazing. I support bringing most big decisions to the Board, especially if they&#39;re PPC community-related or PPC canon-related. And I <i>do not</i> support closing the Discord entirely, whether short-term or long-term.</b><br><br>~Zingenmir</li>

            <p>I was a bit vague when proposing the &quot;best of&quot;, so I might as well say that I like the idea of it being a collaborative Board thread (that someone summarizes for the Wiki after it&#39;s done, probably).<br><br>On asking permission to quote, I agree it&#39;s best to do that just to be on the safe side. In theory, no one should be saying anything in Discord they&#39;d object to getting plastered onto the front page of the Board, but in practice, the chat is a bit more private (you can&#39;t read it without some indication you might be doing so) and a bit more spontaneous, so you want to make sure everyone&#39;s OK with being quoted.<br><br>Agreed on the modifications to the bit about positive discussion, especially where missions and such are concerned. I definitely remember when Nesh posted her latest mission two months back (wow, I could have sworn it was longer ago) I said a few words about it in chat (rot13&#39;d) that eventually ended up in my Board review. I&#39;ll also admit to giving people their reviews (especially if they&#39;re vague and underdeveloped thoughts) over chat instead of on the Board if we&#39;re both around.<br><br>Additionally, it&#39;s practice on the Discord that if you expect someone will be on soon (say, within a day) and you think they should see some bit of discussion (for example, you think they&#39;d be interested in the fic you linked), you @mention them so they can jump to it and read it. This is a good system, but we should keep in mind that tagging someone in on a conversation about them doesn&#39;t automatically make it not be behind their back.<br><br>I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve seen community decision-making over chat. However, the discussion has very occasionally veered into topics that would probably be more appropriate for a Board post, and we should be less hesitant to take matters here.<br><br>Public chat isn&#39;t the place for grievances and drama, I agree. It&#39;s sort of the worst of both worlds compared to taking it to a private discussion or posting on the Board, .</p>

            <p>It&#39;s partially also a question of &quot;I think this RP was awesome, do you mind if I put this chunk of it up on the Board?&quot; &quot;...eh, sure, I like how that one came out.&quot; or &quot;If you *really* want to, but I don&#39;t like that piece of it, and that bit looks really OOC to me...I&#39;d rather you didn&#39;t.&quot; or even &quot;Sure, but I really don&#39;t like that one line I wrote at the end there, would you mind cutting it earlier?&quot; Stuff like that. In some cases, it&#39;s less a question of &#39;is this public or private&#39; and more &#39;do you, the author, think this is as good as I do and are okay with my bringing attention to it.&#39;<br><br>So that&#39;s another side of getting permission to quote things from the Discord on the Board; I know I&#39;ve participated in some RPs there that I really liked and in another couple where I felt uninspired at the time and think it was reflected in my writing. I&#39;d personally probably be okay with both types being quoted here, but I would want to add a note to the post explaining why I think one of them is a better example of my writing or something like that.<br><br>(I used RPs as an example here, but it&#39;d work pretty similarly with jokes and so on).<br><br>Another thing that could be brought to the Board is the recs and plugs channel. We do occasionally end up with an OT thread where people recommend music and stories and whatever else; maybe there could be one a little more frequently? Could be something to consider (though I&#39;d say definitely have only one on the front page at a time if it catches on).<br><br>Of course, another piece of the Discord that frequently gets moved to recs and plugs is talk about badfic. Some readings have been recorded and made their way to the Board before, but you&#39;ve also got a bunch of written snarking going on. I&#39;m not sure whether this would really work as a thing to bring to the Board, especially since presumably some of it gets transferred into either a mission or a note on the Unclaimed Badfic page (at least...I think some of these are being claimed or put on the unclaimed list? I could be wrong). It is a thing that happens, though. Maybe it&#39;d be best suited to a note or two in the potential collaborative Board thread or blog post (it could be summarized with some included quotes of badfic and snark? Highlights style!)<br><br>Anyway. This isn&#39;t really an attempt to add to my votes--it&#39;s just more suggestions for the development of a &#39;Best of Discord&#39; thing combined with an...additional clarification? I&#39;m going to go with that and call it a day.<br><br>Good night,<br><br>~Zing</p>

<li>I&#39;m pretty sure VM voted for no ban in this thread<br><br>2. On the other hand, I don&#39;t think Alleb&#39;s post has anything to say about bans other than that she shouldn&#39;t get one. That might count as an implicit abstain, but I think that&#39;s your call.<br><br>3. Is this a majority vote? I don&#39;t recall most of our previous ban votes (or any votes for that matter) being decided on the basis of a majority. Then again, a lot of the previous votes weren&#39;t so evenly split, so I don&#39;t think we ever had to settle the question of what exactly a community consensus looks like. <br><br>The counting of abstain votes is a bit of a tricky question, and I&#39;ll probably write up my thoughts once I figure out what they are.<br><br>3b. Who&#39;s &quot;you&quot; in &quot;when you announce the decision&quot;? As far as I&#39;m concerned, you (hS) are the person who felt bothered to start counting, which means you get to set the specifics of how to count (and to a degree how to decide the vote) unless they&#39;re outlandish enough that someone objects to them. </li>

I don&#39;t know if you were around, but during the Data Junkie ban vote I was made so miserable by being the person who Had To Make The Decisions (and was Making Them Wrong, according to various people) that I had to hand it over to Desdendelle.

            <p>Mods: I don&#39;t think we need mods on the Board.The Nameless Admin, so far, has been more than enough in my humble opinion.<br><br>Bans:<br>- A medium term &quot;global&quot; ban for Tomash (3-6 months). One year bans are usually reserved for those who don&#39;t come to their senses and apologize, while Tomash did - but, at the same time, apologizing should not be a &quot;get-out-of-jail&quot; card when very serious offenses are made. It is not a matter of revenge, or punishment for punishment&#39;s sake, but a matter of consequences, as I mentioned in my other post.<br><br>- A short-medium Discord ban for the ones involved in the witch-hunting (1-3 months), coupled with a shorter Board ban as well (2 weeks - 1 month), with the same reasoning as above.<br><br>About the Discord, I&#39;m afraid I have no ideas.

<li>Mods would be good, I think. I know I can&#39;t be trusted to do the right thing in telling people something isn&#39;t okay, let alone actually dangerous to someone&#39;s health in some way. I don&#39;t have any suggestions on who should be a mod, though.<br><br>2. Bans. I feel a bit uncomfortable voting on this one, but I think a 3-month ban for Tomash might be needed. Considering the lack of consensus, though, I doubt that will happen.<br><br>3. The Discord. I don&#39;t think anything needs to be changed, but I do like the idea of having all of us become more educated on the subject of cyberbullying. If we can find good online resources about how to recognize it and break the mob mentality, that would be great going forward. Assuming such resources are found, it may be a good idea to link them in the Wiki next to the space about the Discord, and post them in the notice channel for good measure.<br><br>Unfortunately, I don&#39;t know good resources for information on that. I&#39;m just throwing ideas around. I am not in favor of getting rid of the Discord, either temporarily or permanently, but I also think that changing nothing isn&#39;t going to be helpful to anyone.</li>

            <p>No mods. I happen to think that our anarchic culture <i>mostly</i> works. In general, we do a good job of being friendly, calling each other on our bad behavior, and being remorseful and honestly trying to improve when we screw up. If you look around all the threads that spawned from this whole mess, you&#39;ll find piles of our community working as it should. <br><br>That doesn&#39;t mean we&#39;re perfect. The entire witch-hunt in the Discord is a prime example of that. While that was going on, many of us stopped acting the way we should and either turned into an angry mob or stood there and didn&#39;t call anyone out on what they were doing. We need to examine how and why that happened, and make serious efforts to not do things like that again. Hopefully we can learn appropriate lessons from what went down that will make the PPC an even better place to hang out on the Internet.<br><br>Now, on my ban. I&#39;m going to do something that I don&#39;t remember happening before, and vote for my own ban. I&#39;m in favor of my being banned for 1-3 months, either from the Discord or from participation in the PPC generally. There have to be consequences for what I did. It doesn&#39;t feel <i>right</i> for me to get away with just a resignation after what I did, even if it was a mistake. The vote seems to be (at the time of writing) split exactly evenly between banning me or not, so it looks like i might be going harder on myself than the community is.<br><br>Now, on the Discord, this isn&#39;t a proposal for massive changes. However, I&#39;m now (especially since July&#39;s post got me reading some of the old discussions about the IRC and drama there) slightly concerned about the possibility of a cultural split between PPCers who visit the chat often and PPCers who don&#39;t. I figure one small thing that can be done to try and make sure we don&#39;t get this is for, every once in a while, people to &quot;best of&quot; the chat and summarize the longer-lasting jokes/trends onto the Board and/or Wiki. (We already have a wiki page for chat quotes from back in the IRC days, might be worth revitalizing). <br><br>To give an example of what I&#39;m on about, Maslab has a reputation in chat for puns. That reputation was long-standing and widespread enough that we ended up adding Maslab&#39;s avatar (a picture of a fox) as a custom emoticon on the Discord. So, if you&#39;re in chat and you make a pretty good (or pretty bad, but what&#39;s the difference?) pun, you&#39;re likely to get your message reacted to with a :Maslab: . Now some of y&#39;all who don&#39;t really visit chat know a bit more about what we&#39;ve been up to in there other than starting mobs and drama.</p>

            <p>1) No mods. In addition to the issues others have raised, I feel mods are ill-suited to our community. They depend, I think, on a certain level of detachment from all parties involved in a dispute. That lack of bias seems rather more difficult to attain in a close knit community like ours. Perhaps they could be made to work, but would they work so much better than what we have now as to justify the change? I don&#39;t think so. Then again, I&#39;ve never really been part of a community that uses them, so perhaps this is simply my inexperience talking.<br><br>2) No bans. As I mentioned in <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=306661;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">my previous post,</a> if disciplinary action must be taken, I don&#39;t think bans are the right tool. <br><br>3) I can&#39;t think of anything we can do to improve the Discord, so I&#39;ll abstain from that vote.</p>

            <p>1) No mods. What we need is a culture change, and those don&#39;t happen top-down. Additionally, there&#39;s no way to ensure that mods don&#39;t engage in this behavior also. <br><br>2) No bans. If Tomash wants to take a leave of absence, I support his decision, but if the person harmed by this doesn&#39;t think he should be banned, I think it&#39;s a bad idea - partly because of the &quot;symbolic&quot; nature of it. We&#39;d be doing this to make it feel like someone had been punished, which is not a substitute for fixing the problem. Tomash made a mistake- the first time he&#39;s done something like this - and moved quickly to repair the damage once he realized it was a mistake. <br><br>3) The Discord. Keep it. Have an honest, serious conversation with the people involved in this about what went wrong, why, and how they can move as individuals to stop it happening again. Again, what we need is a culture change. And, preferably, also, not one mod to step in, but for everyone involved to say &quot;Wait, we&#39;re rushing this out of emotion. Let&#39;s take a step back and let people&#39;s heads cool.&quot;</p>

            <p>When you called for a &quot;culture change&quot;, I interpreted that as saying there&#39;s some way we typically act here that&#39;s a bad thing and needs to change. That is, I think you said that some aspect of what the PPC <i>is</i> and how it conducts its affairs is part of the reason for all the stuff that happened these last few days. If that&#39;s what you meant, could you please spell out in more detail what needs to be different?<br><br>To restate my position and to mention the other thing I think you might have wanted to say, I think that the general problem recently was caused by a significant failure on our parts (well, certainly on those of us who were participating in chat Thursday) to live up to our ideals. We need to examine how that happened (mostly on a personal level, I figure, since, after all, the community is made up of each of us), and make efforts to not slip up so drastically again, but the way our community functions is generally fine.</p>

            <p>This might sound weird and backwards, but my instinct is actually that we have an obsession with rooting out bullies that seems to often turn into bullying. Rather than focusing on behavior, we focus on people. I was one person who thought July&#39;s behavior was bullying, several years ago, but since her behavior of late has been eminently reasonable - when she&#39;s even been around, which is rarely - it made absolutely no sense to target her as The Bully. To bring up an historical moment, back when the big IRC drama broke, there was also that question of Who Is/Are The <i>Real</i> Bullies Here? It was a moot point; both parties engaged in bad behavior. Likewise, as soon as the &quot;witch hunt&quot; scandal broke, and it became obvious that July was the victim here, not the perpetrator, the tide turned and folk went looking for a new bully figure - which turned out to be you (or, depending on who you ask, Desdendelle). This has been a pattern in the past. Data and Toroll&#39;s behavior was a serious problem; <s>rather than</s> along with addressing trolling, we fixated on Is Data Enough of a Jerk to Ban* and Who Is Toroll, which I still think was/is an almost entirely useless question. Frequently hS comes up as target for Tyrannical Dictator of PPC Discussion because people listen to his opinion. Less frequently, Neshomeh gets tarred with a less-opaque version of that brush. <br><br>Only rarely have we had open-and-shut cases of bullies as the horns-and-pitchfork version we like them to be. Usually it&#39;s more like this. July has a problem with Matt Cipher. She disengages with him. He pokes her on a public space and she calls him out, then, because Matt Is Not A Bully (you can tell, we&#39;re friends with him and he doesn&#39;t have horns <i>or</i> a pitchfork), people tell July off for causing a ruckus. If Matt had enough people mad at him, I&#39;m guessing it would have gone the other way. I have a problem with Scapegrace&#39;s recent behavior, because they flew off the handle and sent cruel messages to July, openly proclaimed their hypocrisy in a Board thread without really apologizing for it, denied involvement in the witch hunt, but Scapegrace isn&#39;t &quot;A Bully,&quot; they&#39;re a person who performed behaviors that were hurtful and problematic. I honestly think that if we addressed behaviors rather than people, we&#39;d be dealing with the problem far more effectively, but banhammers, to quote a wise and sensible person, are a blunt force tool, not a precision instrument, and rather than address issues by enforcing mediation (which enables a &quot;You as a person do this behavior, and it needs to stop&quot; approach), we usually address them by calling for, then voting on, a ban (which encourages a &quot;You as a person did this, and <i>you</i> need to be punished&quot; approach).<br><br>Good grief was that a lengthy and complicated answer to a simple question.<br><br>TL;DR We need to address behaviors <i>and not people</i>. Punishing people is an ineffective means to address change in a community.<br><br><br>*Graduated-length banning was one step away from this Punish People Who Are Bad mentality, and a step in the right direction, but I think it didn&#39;t go far enough.</p>

            <p>And you didn&#39;t just say she didn&#39;t like the ending to Rose Potter, you linked &quot;the PPC forgetting about stuff&quot; with &quot;the burnt month&quot; and mentioned that you were quite angry about all of it. You also, during this same period of time, sent July a message in which you told her to leave the PPC and said other cruel things to her. Nova says that was about some unrelated thing, and you say this Rose Potter mention was about some unrelated thing.<br><br>So we&#39;ve got: you&#39;re angry, you point out what you perceive July&#39;s role in the PPC&#39;s forget-about-scandals culture, and you send July an angry message.<br><br>Maybe they are all unrelated.

And honestly, if I am waaay off base and taking you horrifically out of context, I&#39;m sorry for that too. Look: <i>everyone</i> has been angry throughout this. It started as a misunderstanding of Iximaz&#39;s reading of a situation between her and July, was exacerbated by a frenzied conversation on the Discord which was, of course, fueled by very real concern for Iximaz, and then exploded onto the Board, first as a PPC Bullying/July (because of Iximaz&#39;s post) problem, then as a Wait, There Was Doxxing?! problem, now as a What Do We Do About It conversation. At no point, I&#39;m sure, have we all been super calm and rational about this.<br><br>So in essence - I&#39;m still confused about how you think you didn&#39;t contribute to the witch hunt, but I&#39;m sorry for attacking you as a person on the Board, literally in a post saying we should stop doing that, wow I&#39;m kind of an idiot.</p>

            <p>I have been talking to them, and according to them the post sent to July is independent of the goings on Discord and the Board.

            <p>(warning, rambling post that covers several not-unrelated topics ahead)<br><br>This all makes sense.<br><br>As I alluded to in a post a while back, when the permaban calls started flying, it felt like I&#39;d become the target of the angry mob that had been running around looking for a target. Good to know that wasn&#39;t just me who noticed that. (obligatory caveat, doesn&#39;t mean I didn&#39;t do anything wrong and that there shouldn&#39;t be consequences.)<br><br>On the general point, I have nothing to back this up right now, but I suspect that pinning a narrative on someone (X is a jerk, Y is power-hungry, Z exaggerates everything, etc.) is a really easy thought for humans to have. The easy thoughts require less energy than the complicated, nuanced ones about people&#39;s behavior, so we tend to fall into them. I can&#39;t possibly say if there&#39;s a good solution to this. (Well, there&#39;s &quot;everyone try really hard to not think this way&quot;, which could merit a line in the Constitution at best but doesn&#39;t really solve anything)<br><br>Now, I&#39;m going to possibly be a bit annoying and call for specifics again. I read a call near the end to &quot;enforce mediation&quot; and &quot;address behaviors and not people&quot;. That sound great, but what do we do? Should we explicitly try to change our community patterns of conduct (I&#39;m not saying rules because this isn&#39;t a rules question, unless we want something sitting in the Constitution about this)? To what? What should, I, or any other member of the PPC, start or stop doing to make your proposal happen?<br><br>What would have happened/would be about to happen to me in a more-behavior focused PPC after that screwup? <br><br>Finally, small question that I figured I&#39;d slide in here, since you&#39;ve been around for a while. Would you say that there&#39;s a completely unwritten expectation that people who do sufficiently bad (but not banworthy bad) things take a voluntary leave of absence?  It feels like that&#39;s a pattern around here that I haven&#39;t seen anyone type out explicitly.</p>

            <p>Sorry for the delay. Life is crazy right now in several ways.<br><br>Yeah, that&#39;s what it felt like to me too. Again, obviously I still agree what you did was wrong, but the response seemed weird. Especially now that July herself has asked that you not be banned.<br><br>Also, yeah. I do think it&#39;s an easy path for humans - that&#39;s probably why it comes so easily to us here, too. I almost noted that it was a firmware problem in the OP. And I don&#39;t know how to solve it. Besides what we already have, which is asking people to try solving their issues with each other person to person. I do actually really like the idea of third-person mediators, but I&#39;m not certain how it could best be implemented.<br><br>As for the screwup? I have no idea. I guess, ideally, the person directly harmed (July) would have a mediated conversation with you. I think it&#39;s a bit tough to say on that one because it was kind of a big deal, and you did move quickly to fix it before July actually got involved directly.<br><br>Your last point - having never actually considered that pattern, I do actually think you&#39;re right. That seems to be something that happens in cases like this pretty regularly. (Not that they are regular.)</p>

            <p>(No problem on the delay. We all know this is a semi-asynchronous forum.)<br><br>So, I might have more concrete thoughts, but I think they need a short digression to come out right. So, several people have called for &quot;mods&quot;. I think an accurate restatement of that is &quot;The community shall select people who are expected to resolve bad behavior, and who shall impose, or threaten to impose, sanctions in order to do so.&quot;. As I said elsewhere in this thread, I happen to think that isn&#39;t needed.<br><br>Now, the call for &quot;mediators&quot; has a bit less meaning hanging off it, but I&#39;ll try to expand it it the same way. That is, the proposal is &quot;The community shall select people who are expected to attempt to resolve bad behavior by offering to mediate between the involved parties. Community members are expected to accept these offers.&quot;. Well, that seems like a reasonable proposal, and I happen to agree that it might actually work, and at worst can&#39;t hurt.<br><br>As to actually implementing this proposal, I propose the simplest way possible. Declare it to be true! I don&#39;t have the precise wording of any needed changes to Section 2, but I&#39;m voting in favor of making mediation an Official PPC Thing. I invite anyone else who thinks this is a good move to vote for it real quick.<br><br>Now, since I did say &quot;the community shall select&quot;, I might as well start that too, so we don&#39;t have to be vague about it. Going off of my hazy memory and their behavior in this whole mess, I nominate VixenMage, Huinesoron, and Neshomeh as the poor schmucks who get to offer to help folks resolve disputes they&#39;re having.<br><br>On July, we have had a conversation. On my end, it gave me a much better understanding of what it is I did and why it was bad (you can see the results off of July&#39;s goodbye post), among other things. <br></p>

            <p>In the July-Iximaz incident, I emailled both parties to try and talk things through. I helped July in making her apology. I clarified the sincerity of that apology.<br><br>That did not work. The incident remained on Iximaz&#39;s mind for a year. What more do you feel a mediator should have done?

            <p>The only real place my opinions differ is with regard to point 1). I think we need some kind of mod that is more than The Nameless Admin, but less than a full out mod, with the power both on the Board and in the Discord. I will admit I don&#39;t have any ideas for exactly how we achieve that at that moment though. But I do think if it can be achieved it would be a good thing. </p>

            <p>1) As I think I&#39;ve made clear, I am completely pro mods. I wish we could all be trusted to use our judgement and get things done, but we quite obviously can&#39;t do that.

            <p>I&#39;ve thought about this a lot, and I don&#39;t have an answer. It&#39;s clear that the witch-hunt was only made possible because of the real-time chat nature of the channel - look at how quickly it collapsed once it moved to the Board. Given that there&#39;s no support for just getting rid of the chat altogether, I think we need the following rules/mindsets to be taken <b>seriously</b> by the Discord:<br><br>1/ Don&#39;t talk about people behind their backs. <b>Ever.</b> For any reason. Iximaz has just announced she&#39;s leaving? Talk about it on the Board, if she&#39;s not in there with you. She&#39;s accused four people of bullying her? Sure, talk to the ones who are there with you - but if you want to talk about the others, do it on the Board. No exceptions, no excuses.<br><br>This includes positive discussion. If I&#39;ve just posted a mission, and you&#39;re all raving about it in the Discord - so what? That doesn&#39;t do anything to make me feel good about it. Whether you want to congratulate someone, or express sympathy, or condemn them - if they&#39;re not in the Discord at the time, do it on the Board.<br><br>2/ The Discord is not a place to make decisions. <b>Ever.</b> Unless you&#39;re in a game of some sort, if you&#39;re asking &#39;what should we do?&#39;, you need to take that to the Board. Put it on the permanent record, get the input of the entire community - heck, even in the Discord, not everyone&#39;s there all the time!<br><br>These aren&#39;t rules designed to fix every problem. They wouldn&#39;t do a thing about the GlarnBoudin incident, for instance. But I think they can, will, and should deal with the major issue with the live-chat format: the tendency for everyone in a conversation to just flow along with it, however insane it ends up looking from the outside.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Originally I was not planning on even saying goodbye, just allowing the fact that I&#39;ve been posting less and less to say so, and finally letting myself disappear, but that clearly didn&#39;t work and isn&#39;t going to work. <br><br>When all of this began unfolding, I was at work. It wasn&#39;t until I went outside for fresh air that I got bombarded by messages: Scapegrace calling me an awful person who needs friends who will, I quote &quot;rock you back and forth in the puddle of your own endless f***ing self-pity&quot; and telling me to leave the PPC. Desdendelle who had kept messaging me to go &#39;they&#39;re talking about you in the Discord&#39; and apologizing, and trying to make sure that I was okay once the post had gone up on the Board. <br><br>I&#39;ve been on the internet since well before I was eleven years old. The PPC was the first place I got a death threat. Only place to have small groups decide they need to get rid of me whatever the method. Now it&#39;s the first place to dox me, unintentional or not. <br><br>Clearly this isn&#39;t a safe place for me. I won&#39;t kill or hurt myself over the perceptions that others have of me here, but you are not a safe place for me- for my mental health, my happiness, and now possibly even my career. <br><br>Tomash already apologized to me. But plenty of the people in the Discord saw nothing wrong with their behavior <i>until</i> Huinesoron said he saw the logs and pointed that part out. Until someone else pointed out the potential illegality. Only then did the apologies begin to pour out, and with plenty excuses and reasons attached to them. Until the logs became public, people were still in full agreement with what they said and did in the Discord and saw nothing that they had done as wrong. The timing and mentality with all of this should be very, very concerning to all of you. <br><br>So, here&#39;s the official &#39;goodbye&#39; so many of you demanded. You guys win. <br><br>I&#39;m not withdrawing anything I added from the shared universe, but I don&#39;t want my characters to be used or anything from my stories to be referenced.<br><br>I am not interested in being contacted further by anyone here regarding this, so please don&#39;t. To make this clear, I will be removing my contact information from the wiki. </p>

            <p>Both in a general sympathy sense, that you&#39;re leaving, and in the sense that I held onto a grudge for far, far too long, and in indulging it, helped poison the well against you.

            <p>I do not know wether you are going to read this post or not, but in case you are, I want to apologize to you.<br><br>Even though I did not post as much as others during the incident, I am still guilty, like every other person present at the time, of not stepping in. Yes, emotions were running high. Still, that does not excuse the fact that I did not take a step back and did not realize what kind of action was being discussed. Instead all I said was that I was &quot;not sure&quot; about posting the picture on the board. <br><br>I know how hypocritical it comes off to apologize so late, but I both wanted to take a few step backs and think about what I was going to say, and go through the chat logs so I knew <i>exactly</i> what happened and what was being said, and what I did. Emotions can cloud the memoryjust like they cloud the judgement, and I did not want to make the mistake of letting that be the case this time.<br><br>Once again I apologize to you. I can understand your decision to leave, especially after this incident, and I cannot and have no right to try and stop you.<br><br>~Akrinor</p>

            <p>These are the first words that I mean to direct at you since the incident I&#39;ve caused, and now so it happens those shall also be the last. I know you hate me, and you have the full right to do so, but for that one final time I would like to get your attention: <br><br>I have no excuses for my behaviour, both this one and almost six months ago. I didn&#39;t do anything to prevent the mob from rising, I let my emotional attachment overtake me, and for that I will accept any punishment the community should impose onto me. The previous time I acted high-and-mighty, tried to force my way of thinking onto you, and completely ignored your decisions, all while under the delusion of being a friend. <br><br>Truth be told, I am still grateful to you for what you did back in 2015 for me. You are honest, direct, and no-nonsense to the absolute maximum, but whether you are a bully or not... that&#39;s not for me to say, and I shouldn&#39;t build my opinion based on the events I wasn&#39;t there for. <br><br>I will not repeat my mistake and will not even think about stopping you from leaving. What we did put you in potential danger and as much as I would like for us to part ways with at least neutral relationship, that&#39;s unfortunately nothing I can do about anymore.<br><br>So, to sum up, if any of this has any worth to you anymore: I am sorry, JulyFlame, for all this messed up stuff I&#39;ve put you through.</p>

            <p>1- is your apology likely to make July feel at ease or upset if she sees it, given your past interactions?<br><br>2- is your apology, therefore, when you examine the likely outcome, for July&#39;s benefit or yours?<br><br>3- consider that our society has a terrible habit of making women bear the burden of men&#39;s feelings, even in cases where they are trying to actively disengage. (For example, in the women&#39;s day post, your desire to be an ally took precedence over one individual woman&#39;s desire to not interact with you.)<br><br>4- in the future, when someone tells you to leave them alone, apologize ONCE, and then . . . leave them alone. Period. No redemption arc, no reminders, no continued getting other people to mediate, no continued and protracted apologies. Just end it there. If she hasn&#39;t accepted by now, she&#39;s not going to, and this only serves the purpose of making her more uncomfortable. </p>

            <p>Yes, I was worried about you at the time I posted that information in chat. However, that absolutely doesn&#39;t excuse my actions, and it <b>certainly</b> doesn&#39;t make you responsible for them. You didn&#39;t cause me to make that mistake. Neither you nor your words somehow crawled into my brain and turned off my ability to not do something really stupid for a few seconds.<br><br>Like Nesh said somewhere, we all need to take responsibility for our own choices.
