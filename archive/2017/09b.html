            <p>Yeah, I am waay to excited about this. A started talking about it in class.

            <p>There&#39;s two questions here, really:<br><br><b>Is it actually &#39;a new type of chocolate&#39;?</b><br><br>That depends entirely on how you define &#39;chocolate&#39;. If you&#39;re referring specifically to the bars (and their derivatives), then yes, it is: until the Ruby Chocolate project began 13 years ago, this stuff had never been made into chocolate bars.*<br><br>*Actually even this isn&#39;t strictly true. <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=ivory+coast&amp;oq=ivory+coast&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.5000j1j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8">The Guardian</a> reports that the beans are grown in Brazil, Ecuador, and Côte d&#39;Ivoire - the latter being in Africa, meaning these trees have probably been in use in the chocolate industry for a while. But they weren&#39;t used exclusively, as it were.<br><br>But is that a fair use of the word? &#39;Chocolate&#39; derives from the Nahuatl (Aztec/Maya) word <i>xocolātl</i>, and if you allow the native drink to be included as &#39;chocolate&#39;, then the first &#39;Ruby chocolate&#39; probably pre-dates the European discovery of the Americas.<br><br>So, like so many things, the question ultimately comes down to semantics.<br><br><b>Does it matter?</b><br><br>Sadly, yes. There is a long, long history of <s>white people</s> <s>Europeans</s> more technologically-advanced/richer nations exploiting the product of poorer ones. Sometimes, those poorer nations/peoples were even deliberately constructed - the tobacco and cotton industries, for instance, were built on the backs of African slaves in North America and the Caribbean. Other times, they were just taken over, politically and economically.<br><br>Nor has the problem gone away. Vast swathes of Africa are short of food because farmers can make more money growing bananas for Europe and America than they can growing their own crops. They&#39;re not being forced to do it (any more)... but the economic structure the First World set up is meticulously designed to keep them doing it.<br><br>So, ultimately, the point your friend should have been making is: will this give any benefit to the Brazilians, Ecuadorians, and Ivorians who actually grow the stuff? Or will it just product more incentive for European and American corporations to keep them growing cash crops that leave their country in ruins?<br><br>One thing&#39;s for sure: there&#39;s no chance the people growing the cocoa trees will ever get to taste Ruby chocolate.<br><br>hS<br><br>(The third question, which doesn&#39;t need discussing but which might be worth thinking about, is &#39;why didn&#39;t you like that?&#39;. Had to say it; consider it dropped. ~hS)</p>

            <p>Yes, I am aware, more or less. I understand. And it is terrible.<br><br>The reason I don&#39;t like it is that, judging by context, the person who raised it didn&#39;t do so to make a point or start an intersting conversation about colonialism and European exploitation, which, while uncomfortable, could be interesting. They did it, so far as I can tell, to be a flippant buzzkill towards my genuine enthusiasm about there being a new type of chocolate. And frankly, &quot;new in bar form&quot; is new enough for me.<br><br>Yes, I know that the world sucks. But can I at least have this one thing, just for a little while?<br><br>Okay, there is another reason, too. I hate feeling guilty for things that I have no control over. When people talk about how some horrible thing is done &quot;by white people,&quot; I feel implicitly implicated in something I never did, or was even involved in. And I hate it. So that&#39;s another reason.<br><br>Although I do love chocolate. So I suppose I&#39;ll shoulder some blame for the demand for the stuff.</p>

            <p>Always a difficult subject.<br><br>I don&#39;t want to get too deep into this, mostly because I&#39;m not really very well-versed in the topic, but what I&#39;ve heard from various quarters is this: you don&#39;t have to feel guilty for the things you didn&#39;t do. However, we do exist in a system that is set up to unfairly benefit some people more than others, and as such we have a responsibility to challenge that system rather than passively sitting back and enjoying it. How you choose to bring a challenge is up to you and your individual ability, whether it&#39;s active campaigning or making educated decisions about how to spend your money or voting for progressive policies or just trying to be decent to people, but it always starts at home, by challenging your own assumptions about how the world works and how it should work.<br><br>For instance, that &quot;one little thing&quot; you want. You&#39;ve got the ability to be upset by that because (I presume) you&#39;re not currently worrying about food, clean water, shelter, physical safety, and other basic necessities. Can you have that little thing? Yeah, you can. That&#39;s the essence of privilege. That doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s not cool, and you can enjoy it, but be grateful, don&#39;t take it for granted, and make sure you buy it from a fair trade source.<br><br>It sounds like you probably know that really, and that you&#39;re on the right track. It gets easier to recognize these things, if not nicer, the more you work at it.<br><br>And it doesn&#39;t excuse people being jerks just to be jerks, either. Justice should never be smug.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Yeah, I agree with all of that. There are a lot places where systems break down, or are unfair, and we should examine and question those systems to see if they can be improved. I&#39;m a programmer - or at least, I want to be. This is the sort of thing that I might do as a job someday, although in a very different context.<br><br>Everyone who has covered this previously has been smug, incomprehensible, seemingly focused on making me feel guilty, or all three. <br><br>So congratulations, Nesh.

            <p>One of the things I&#39;ve always struggled with in writing is figuring out how to craft characters who are actually different from each other, and keep them that way. All of my characters have a tendency to drift towards the same snarky baseline, which is fairly undesirable.<br><br>Recently, I&#39;ve tried out a number of different ways of fixing this problem, and I thought it might be interesting to throw them out here. Perhaps they&#39;ll help anyone else who&#39;s having the same issue. Perhaps there are Boarders who&#39;ve come up with their own ways of solving the problem, and would like to share them (hint, hint). Perhaps they&#39;ll just spark a bit of discussion. Let&#39;s find out!<br><br><hr>
<br><br><u>#1: Modelling on People/Characters</u><br><br>This method grows directly out of being a fanfic writer. If you can write Legolas in-character as Legolas, then why not use the same technique to keep your own creation &#39;in-character&#39; as a canon? Write what the canon would do, if they were in your character&#39;s situation.<br><br>This approach has the advantage that, if you watch/read enough of the source canon, it&#39;s pretty easy to form a good idea of what they would do. This is a fundamental skill for a fanfic writer, so it can be extended easily across to OCs. The downside is that it might end up being obvious (if your character keeps getting angry and smashing things with a lightsaber, people are going to look at Kylo Ren), and that the further you get from the character&#39;s baseline, the harder it can be to reliably predict their reactions.<br><br>The ultimate extension of this is self-inserts: you try and write them doing what <i>you</i> would do in the same situation. But we all know how badly self-inserts can go wrong…<br><br><u>#2: Keywords</u><br><br>Agent Kaitlyn is &#39;bouncy wannabe hobbit&#39;. Agent Huinesoron is (or was, originally) &#39;racist snob&#39;. If you can describe your character in two or three words, they can be pretty easy to keep to that characterisation.<br><br>This works very well for secondary and background characters; if they&#39;re only showing up occasionally, having a quick handle to latch your writing onto is ideal. It&#39;s less useful for protagonist types: it locks them out of progressing as characters, and can render them kind of flat. Agent Huinesoron has been breaking out of this (deliberately); Agent Kaitlyn has mostly stayed there (again, deliberately), because she&#39;s fun the way she is.<br><br><u>#3: Key Phrase</u><br><br>&quot;I like guns, and I don&#39;t do <i>scared</i>… and apparently I&#39;m a maudlin drunk.&quot; That&#39;s Agent Morgan, and that sentence let Lily Winterwood characterise her perfectly in <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Mt0lDIl3rhevzVwzHYODOyccDKDHKH4qsQ0ZU_nCYps/pub">the Blackout epic &#39;Generic Surface&#39;</a>. If your character can be tied to a phrase like this - not necessarily a catchphrase, though it can be - it can be a good way to share them with other people.<br><br>It gives more than the plain keywords, too. Morgan&#39;s &#39;don&#39;t do scared&#39; shows off how she talks, and hints that she&#39;s not so much without fear as unwilling to admit to it. I think this method comes out of my fondness for acting - you can slip into an accent or a performance much easier if you have a key phrase to get started.<br><br>The downsides are much the same as for keywords, but in spades: they end up sticking as the character who would say the phrase, regardless of what it is. Luckily for me, that works pretty well for Time Lords.<br><br><u>#4: Twin Elements</u><br><br>There are <s>118</s> four elements - Earth, Air, Fire, and Water - and each of them can be used to describe a character. If I tell you someone is fiery, you imagine them as feisty, hotheaded, maybe angry; you can immediately tell they&#39;re not going to be calm and water-like.<br><br>So far, so shallow. The trick with this technique is to <i>layer</i> the elements. I phrase this as &#39;X, with hidden Y&#39;. One character I&#39;ve used this for is described as &#39;Water with hidden Air&#39;. He&#39;s mysterious, magical, &#39;deep&#39; - but underneath it all, kind of flighty (and actually a huge geek).<br><br>This is a great way to construct characters with multiple layers, and since it&#39;s about basic characterisation rather than specific traits, it can carry through character development. It does run into the problem that two Earth characters are likely to look much the same, even if one has hidden Water and the other Fire. Use it in small groups to set up differences; don&#39;t try and spread it too far.<br><br><u>#5: Animals</u><br><br>Almost a callback to #1 - rather than starting with another character, begin with an animal. If I tell you a character is owlish, or hedgehog-like, you conjure up an immediate idea of how they&#39;ll act, and maybe even how they&#39;ll look. That idea may be completely different from what <i>I</i> imagine - but that doesn&#39;t really matter so long as I, as the writer, can keep it consistent.<br><br>This is also another &#39;layered&#39; characterisation tool. The ideas we have about animals tend to be multifaceted. A cat is prideful, but also lazy, and can be prone to fits of rage. A hedgehog is both adorable and prickly, and can be extremely defensive. Of course, this can be prone to drift… I&#39;m pretty sure the character I pinned &#39;owl&#39; to isn&#39;t a silent hunter type, but the animal might end up pointing her in that direction…<br><br><hr>
<br><br>In our messy reality, most of the time you&#39;re going to use a mix of different ways to keep your characters IC, and probably even change it up over time. But I feel like having something to latch onto makes it easier - not only to get them started (and to stop them all consisting entirely of snarky one-liners), but to keep them going once they&#39;re made.<br><br>But what do <i>you</i> think?<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>First off, yes, I&#39;m still here. I haven&#39;t left. I&#39;m just kept very, very busy with tiring RL things. I&#39;m hoping to carve out enough time and energy to get back into the community, but it&#39;s not a given thing.<br><br>Okay. Now that the explanation is out of the way, characters and character building! I love it. Probably a bit too much, which ties into why I&#39;m never able to get anything actually done.<br><br>Of the methods that hS has mentioned here, I probably gravitate towards the first and second most of all. But only as a baseline. Once I establish the core of a character, then I start adding on characteristics and personality attributes. These can depend on what I want or need the character to do in the narrative, but sometimes they can just follow flights of fancy. Hopefully, I end up with something that is both distinct and still at least a little connected to my original vision. Or maybe not. Maybe all that editing and adding has created something totally different from what I originally intended. Which is also good.<br><br>Here&#39;s an example. For the last PPC Hunger Games, I made up a trio of scientists to provide commentary on the actions of Holo-Acacia: Dr. Daphne St. Auguste, Tess Jachowicz, and Naas&#39;Gehlen vas Headquarters. The trio taken as a whole was modeled after the Mads from <i>MST3K</i>: the pushy, vaguely immoral scientist and his/her oddball flunkies. But that was just a rough sketch. I didn&#39;t want them to go full Mads; I wanted them to be actually competent, for one thing.<br><br>Let&#39;s go into more specifics. In addition to being inspired by the Mads, St. Auguste was a keyphrase character: &#39;the know-it-all genius.&#39; And what good is being a know-it-all genius if nobody else knows you&#39;re such? So, I threw in her traits of rambling and always saying what was on her mind. There&#39;s still a bit of that original immorality, but I muted it to academic malfeasance rather than &#39;torturing people with bad movies.&#39;<br><br>Jachowicz was meant to be the sane woman to St. Auguste&#39;s vague unhinged-ness, which unfortunately is not a position that necessarily lends itself toward making detailed characters. That being said, I was able to expand her characterization on the fly simply by reacting to events in the PPC Hunger Games: her diplomatic nature that slips a little when her boss isn&#39;t looking, her willingness to debate, and her vague affinity for parts of the <i>Star Wars</i> prequels. I hope to expand on her further given the opportunity. <br><br>Naas&#39;Gehlen was meant to be the snarker. Whereas Jachowicz would respond to her boss with gentle debate or agreement, Naas was meant to be the one to crack wise. He was laid-back and easy-going, as opposed to the two more serious women. I actually patterned a bit him in my mind after a real person: NASA engineer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobak_Ferdowsi">Bobak Ferdowski</a>, aka the mohawk guy from the Curiosity mission.<br><br>So… that went a little longer than expected. But I guess that&#39;s sort of the case with building characters: it can go on for longer than you expect, and weave you into some corners you maybe didn&#39;t expect.<br><br>Finally, let me just push this old thing back out into the spotlight one more time: <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/User_blog:PoorCynic/Workshop_One:_Characters">my workshop on characters</a>.

            <p>-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----<br>Hash: SHA512<br><br>When it comes to pitching fictional characters, I&#39;ve really been a fan of what I&#39;ve called the &quot;Mini Story&quot; method, and not using adjectives or subjective qualities that leave things open for guessing. Instead, I prefer to use means of describing characters that is much more concrete. Although I advise this to other people who pitch their characters to me, I also think it could be one way to expand on characters that aren&#39;t fully finished yet and figuring out the hows and why&#39;s of who this character is.<br><br>It&#39;s one thing for someone to say, for example: &quot;My character is really proud of herself but can be modest too.&quot; This really doesn&#39;t tell me much about your character, and I think that&#39;s the best way to give people the wrong idea about your character because everyone will interpret being proud of yourself in different ways. I think a better way I could put this would be to tell what I call a &quot;Mini Story&quot; about your character.<br><br>&quot;My character likes to brag about her accomplishments in sports but if she meets someone who shows more expertise than her, she&#39;ll always shut up and listen.&quot;<br>&quot;My character loves to show off her acting skills in front of other people, but keeps her acting life separate from her stage life and doesn&#39;t talk about it.&quot;<br>&quot;My character flaunts her swordsmanship in front of other people, but when she sees magic, immediately shuts up.&quot;<br><br>Not only does telling a &quot;Mini Story&quot; shed more light about your character and give some concrete examples of what they do, it also can shed a bit of light on your setting, possibly their job, and also is able to separate, reconcile, and add more depth to two contradictory terms.<br><br>When it comes to making characters and not just pitching them, I find that if I start with one &quot;Mini Story&quot; I can start branching off from there, and build more onto that Mini Story by asking myself questions about the character. From there I can build more onto it.<br><br>&quot;My character loves to brag about her accomplishments in sports.&quot; -<br><br>Maybe she was in a varsity?<br>Did she build any friends in there?<br>How could some of those friendships affected her?<br>Friends don&#39;t last forever, why would some of them have not made it?<br>How could this have had an impact on her as a character? How did this affect her worldview?<br><br>Or we could take a different road and take the first.<br><br>Why would she choose to so readily shut up and listen?<br>It sounds like she has a competitive streak, which is tempered by respect for people that are more experienced than her. Why such reverence?<br>Was she humbled in the past in a way that could&#39;ve left a lasting impact on her?<br>Why?<br>How does this apply to the rest of who she is as a character?<br><br>- From there things just grow, and I find that having these sorts of things written down also helps, especially if you&#39;re trying to explain the character to another person. These notes come in incredibly valuable when trying to explain who the character is to someone else without having to give them the whole infodump, and can let you explain a character in just a few bites of information, without making your audience go glass-eyed.<br>-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----<br><br>iLUEARMKAB0WIQTfllUBtaeNnRzzfmVK3+74uImA+wUCWb3MIgAKCRBK3+74uImA<br>+83pAgCJD3+K/ENYbqzrcKGscPNky4A5CgcJGpcRE0YVyBLLOmjMLBJCnUS5ZESs<br>a74Zb5btKYbvgZAhK3Wlo5ndNBkQAf92lIZos27X9W3y1fS8bBZmnj8ph2SaNkyC<br>5yVKrIY7Es9cSmglyHxPV+DJ4LYkfWcZX9Vf3g+Tnb9xDOS0rTFe<br>=9a4C<br>-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----<br></p>

            <p>I actually, just a bit ago, spent a whole heap of time fiddling around with working in a new character, and had a similar issue. I&#39;ve found that, at least for me, with what I write, how I write, et al, that a good way to differentiate a character is by considering their chemistry with other characters. What &#39;role&#39; they fill amongst a cast of characters, how they interact with them, that sort of thing. <br><br>The first PPCfellows I developed - Finch and Bingle - came out as a result of that sort of thing, in fact - one being intensely caustic and paranoid and, to contrast, the other being incredibly passive and somewhat dopey, with the rest of their personalities developing around those concepts. &#39;Why&#39; Finch is paranoid, &#39;why&#39; Bingle is passive, et al. I recently realised that many of the other characters I had in the thingy I&#39;m doing were very sort of accepting, passive-sorts, so I&#39;ve taken to further emphasising Finch&#39;s rebelliousness, which is certainly a thing I would not have considered on first having written him. Finch was, in fact, in the style of method #1, modelled after another character - Yossarian, from Catch-22. I, initially, was focussing on the &#39;paranoia&#39; aspect of his personality and, in those initial stages, would have decided Finch would have been too cowardly for such rebelliousness. And where he certainly was really quite derivative to start with, I like to think that all of these small alterations eventually led him into growing into more of his own thing. <br><br>This, of course, works a whole lot easier on an ensemble cast, and you got to look out for flat characters with that sort of thing! The character&#39;s role within their cast should serve to be as a guide for the rest of their development - not their entire character. Finch&#39;s role is that of the caustic, rebellious, cowardly straight-man, but he still has personality beyond that, other elements of his personality shaping those particular traits. The classic &#39;why&#39; is he caustic, &#39;why&#39; is he rebellious - &#39;why&#39; does he fit within that role? While he is made to work well with certain characters, he can still be written on his own, because he still is his own character, y&#39;know? <br><br>I think there can be a separation, then, of the <i>concept</i> of the character and the <i>delivery</i> of them. At their cores, Yossarian and Finch (at least, how I worked on it) were made of the same concept: a character that is near unreasonably afraid of dying. It was in delivery that they diverged - Yossarian is depicted as compassionate, loyal, constantly falling in love with various women. He loves life and people because he is terrified of losing them. Finch, on the other hand, is bitter, cynical, thinks everyone else is mad. He despises life because he is enraged that it would dare try and leave him. <br>So I guess that could be a thing to consider - look at a character, figure out what, exactly, the most basic, most general concept of them is, and then figure, in what other ways could that concept be delivered? <br>An angry taxi driver could be angry because he hates his job, or maybe he&#39;s angry because he likes it too much and believes nobody respects it enough. That sort of thing. <br><br>I wonder if I even answered the question.<br><br>Chemistry! </p>

            <p>That&#39;s also central to how I make my characters. Not so much the badfic recruits, because everything about them is already known, but Nume is a good example.<br><br>For him, the basic starting concept was Dr. House, or &quot;brilliant misanthrope with a chemical habit.&quot; Well, once he decided he wanted to be his own person and stopped being Generic Agent #2. The Bleep habit actually came from the very first Fill the Plothole I wrote with him, though, in which I interpreted the summary as Legolas coming across an agent&#39;s Bleeprin, accidentally dropped in-fic, and the agents having to go get it back. Proto-Nume was very upset about losing that Bleeprin. Why? Well, wouldn&#39;t it be interesting, I thought, for a PPC agent to have an eidetic memory? He&#39;d know his canon backward, forward, and inside-out, but he&#39;d also be stuck with all the disturbing and awful things that can happen on missions. So that made Bleeprin a vital necessity to normal function and also set him on the road to &quot;brilliant.&quot; &quot;Misanthrope&quot; came along for the ride.<br><br>So why does a guy like that do a job like this? Few people become PPC agents who aren&#39;t in some way passionate about it, and that holds true for Nume, too. One of his stealth traits is that he loves his job. He wouldn&#39;t trade being a PPC agent for anything. Why? His life back home was kinda rough. He was a huge geek in a time when being a huge geek wasn&#39;t easy. He grew up wanting to be on the bridge of the Enterprise, or at least somewhere in Middle-earth. He loves his canons better than he loves himself. And every so often, it shows.<br><br>But how do I know he comes from that time? Oddly enough, because of his voice—and, I&#39;m embarrassed to admit, a bit of my own teenage arrogance. I thought I needed to explain my tendency to use big words and unusual turns of phrase somehow. That is the sole reason Nume is from the 70s: because I thought I sounded older than I was. Sigh. But, once I&#39;d made that call, I was stuck with it, so I had to actually learn more about the 50s-70s and how growing up in that time would shape someone. That&#39;s how Nume ended up taking some inspiration from my dad, and sounding a bit like him sometimes. I think that&#39;s how he ended up being a Trekkie, too, because <i>Star Trek</i> was on the air then, and it&#39;s kind of the original modern fandom. It worked. So I had to learn <i>Trek</i>, too. &gt;.&gt;<br><br>What else... Oh yes, why does Nume swear the way he does? Catholic upbringing, deeply resented. Why does he know medical stuff? His parents were a doctor and a nurse. Why is he squicked out by sex? That repressed religious upbringing fits the bill again. Why does he hate people? He was a freak in a less tolerant world, and people were pretty much never good to him, so why bother?<br><br>Eventually, all the pieces just kinda fit together and you end up with a whole, solid character. The more you ask why, the more you find out, and every answer makes them more unique and more them. {= )<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>For me, characterization is build in large part upon what they sound like in my head—what kinds of words they use, are they prone to rambling or not, subtle or blunt, evasive or direct, and other dichotomies like that.<br><br>This is tied directly into their background. Agent Derik, for example, talks a certain way because he&#39;s Pernese and Harper-trained, and also based on the Phantom of the Opera. (In his case, your canon character model is useful.) But mostly he&#39;s Pernese, which tells me what kind of slang he uses and doesn&#39;t use, terms he&#39;s likely to think in, etc. He&#39;s also intelligent and educated, which matters.<br><br>Gall, on the other hand, is intelligent but uneducated. She&#39;s less likely to use big Latin-derived words, and her direct, no-nonsense personality means she&#39;s going to be blunt and cut straight to the point of whatever she&#39;s trying to say, whether anyone likes it or not. She&#39;s unlikely to ramble. She doesn&#39;t mind being crude and even offensive. But she does have a soft spot for her dragon, and doesn&#39;t mind cooing over him, either. Her home continuum has sort of a loose voice itself, with plenty of anachronisms used for humor, which means I&#39;m not too restricted in the kinds of references she can use—one reason I wanted to write her.<br><br>Closely related to voice are the things a character cares about enough to talk (or snark) about. What do they especially like? Dislike? Fear? Hate? Want? For PPC characters, I think about this in terms of what bugs them about badfic. Everybody has their own pet peeve(s) that will always drive them up the wall. For Nume, it&#39;s medical BS and messing up the lore he knows so well. For Ilraen, it&#39;s screwing with the characters&#39; loving relationships and cruelty, intentional or not, especially to children and animals. For Derik, it&#39;s messing with dragons and music. For Gall, she really hates fluff and also tends to notice when the story contradicts itself.<br><br>They also all have their particular favorite or well-known fandoms, which make them more invested and motivated.<br><br>Related to voice is mannerisms. Everyone has little physical tics they do subconsciously, especially when they&#39;re nervous or upset. Derik touches his hair; Nume, his neck or face; Gall paces or fidgets; Ilraen shuffles his feet or fusses with his hands. There&#39;s also how they show affection (if they show it). Nume is extremely reserved physically, but even he might give the occasional approving nod. Derik often is, too, but in his more ebullient moments he might clap someone on the shoulder or shake their hand. Gall will give a friendly slap or punch. Ilraen is tentative (comes of being around Nume all the time), but will pat someone, or hug them if the situation warrants.<br><br>I know all these little details because the characters tell me, but you could also assign them deliberately. I think the main bullet points are level of vocabulary, style of slang/cultural references (also includes whether and how they curse), key likes and dislikes, and physical mannerisms.<br><br>I hope that helps!<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I view my characters as starting off like a ball of snow (dirt, wet sand, whatever) and as the story progresses, they roll around, becoming bigger. Do they roll over sticks? Do they pick them up, or do those break them? Are they getting dirtier over time? Are they getting large, and the same as they started? It&#39;s simple, but it works for me.</p>

            <p>...the idea makes me kinda wince.  I love Young Wizards, I like PJato somewhat, but I just don&#39;t feel like they&#39;d mesh well--what would either universe gain from crossing with the other narrative-wise?</p>

            <p>In fact, that fits perfectly well - they&#39;re Powers who built something (western civilisation, in the case of the Olympians), but then never managed to let go of it.<br><br>You look at someone like Artemis, who wanders around by herself with the few people she likes - and you compare her to the Power we meet in <i>A Wizard Abroad</i>, who hangs out by themselves and doesn&#39;t like to admit who they are. It&#39;s a very similar approach.<br><br>Does that mean they&#39;re influenced by the Lone One? Well, to the extent that everything is, sure. But I think it&#39;s a mistake to project Michael onto all the Powers. The One&#39;s Champion is a very distinct individual, and is predisposed to a black-and-white worldview. We&#39;ve barely met any other Powers (that I remember, anywise), but there&#39;s no reason to assume they&#39;re as... well, <i>angelic</i>, even if in the fire-and-brimstone sense, as the Champion.<br><br>Interestingly, <a href="http://www.youngwizards.com/ErrantryWikiOld/index.php/Michael_Power">the wiki</a> identifies Michael with both Athena and Thor (and Prometheus, who has a role in one of the PJ series, I think). Having multiple avatars of the same Power bobbing around could make for a <i>very</i> interesting story - though I&#39;m going to take a stab in the dark that this one does nothing of the sort.<br><br>[Reads to check]<br><br>... wow. That is a pretty textbook Gary-Stu. I gave up at the point where Artemis wouldn&#39;t talk to him until he swore not to hurt her.<br><br>Anyway, yeah, no. Doesn&#39;t look like it&#39;s bothered to consider the possibilities at <i>all</i>. I&#39;m not honestly sure the author understands what the Lone Power actually did...<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>-A questionable understanding of how the pantheons could mix (and redundant referencing of &quot;Powers That Be&quot; when just &quot;Powers&quot; makes things less cluttered).<br><br>-Seemingly casting Artemis as the villain??? Or at least the most antagonistic of the gods the protagonist meets.<br><br>-Time travel??? With no indication of the perspective switches from past to future!Alex.<br><br>-Unnecessarly italicization in use of The Speech (and continuous dropping of the <i>The</i> there, as well) when talking with inanimate objects. The whole scenes end up italicized.<br><br>-Apparently the whole fic&#39;s plot is about an AU where Percy dies on his first quest (I wasn&#39;t <i>quite</i> sure where the author was specifying that things screwed up, but I&#39;m not as much a canon expert on Percy Jackson these days, so. =P), and all the gods are at war with each other. So presumably Alex&#39;s Ordeal is about resolving all of <i>that.</i> Not necessarily a charge, but at least there&#39;s context.<br><br>-Oh, and Alex using a spell to <i>siphon off Artemis&#39; power</i> so she won&#39;t be able to kill him (temporarily). I&#39;m not sure if this is actually impossible or if it&#39;s just rubbing <i>me</i> the wrong way.<br><br>-And then, while Alex has no godly parents, there&#39;s a conversation where the gods collectively decide he&#39;s <i>Artemis&#39; bastard son</i> and make her deal with it (narration/Alex indicates that they&#39;re being ridiculous, but see that first bulletpoint up there on this too).<br><br>On the one hand, he looks to have a beta. On the other hand... well.</p>

            <p>Today is a sad day. In about two hours, the NASA space probe <i>Cassini</i> will be plummetting into the atmosphere of Saturn.

            <p>Mostly-wild guessing here, plus a lot of time playing KSP: Cassini broke apart early in atmospheric entry, probably not long after loss of signal. At that time, everything was still moving unbelievably quickly, and anything that was not destroyed by atmospheric forces would have been melted by the heat of reentry. (For example, the iridium-graphite fuel pellet containers.)<br><br>This analysis comes from a few things: First, as a deep-space probe, Cassini was not designed to deal with significant force on her frame. The worst she experienced was launch, which was while everything was bolted down and aligned in a single direction to survive it better. Secondly, entries into gas giants happen unbelievably quickly - multiple times faster than escape velocity here on Earth. So, forces would rapidly have piled up to unsurvivable amounts. And finally, as a vehicle not designed for reentry, Cassini would not have had anything resembling stable airflow around her hull- she would have tumbled in an ever-worsening tumble until failure occurred.</p>

            <p>In my desire to stop being such a general dope about things, I have decided that I should actually start bloody paying attention to the news. Like a not-dope. The thing is, is that it is <i>so easy</i> to come across news sites that are so very biased, so very political, so very concerned with making people that agree with them very angry, and with simply not being read by people that don&#39;t agree with them. <br><br>I don&#39;t want objectivity, don&#39;t get me wrong! Objectivity is impossible in things written by humans, and an objective news site would probably have articles such as &#39;<i>billions of years later, gravity still works</i>&#39; and &#39;<i>how I took oxygen into my body and exhaled carbon dioxide in order to make sure the muscles in my body didn&#39;t shut down.</i>&#39; <br><br>There&#39;s nothing inherently wrong with opinions and subjectivity and politics and biases, but what I think <i>is</i> wrong is when the possibility for reasonable discourse between people of differing opinions is thrown out the window in order to pander towards people who already agree with their articles and make them <i>boil and rupture furiously with exploding outrage and argh how could those idiots do such disgusting things I can&#39;t even believe it arrrrrgh I&#39;m so mad that I could just agree with every single thing this person is saying without fact checking ARRRRGH</i>. <br><br>So, on that note, I have taken to trying to figure out: which news sites are trustworthy? <br><a href="http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/trust-news-sites/">MakeUseOf</a> puts, in their article, the top three to be Associated News Press, BBC, and Brief.news. <br><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/berlinschoolofcreativeleadership/2017/02/01/10-journalism-brands-where-you-will-find-real-facts-rather-than-alternative-facts/#305c4066e9b5">Forbes</a> puts their top three to be the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, and the Washington Post. <br><a href="http://www.toptenz.net/10-reliable-news-sources.php">TopTenz</a> (now if <i>that</i> isn&#39;t an erudite-looking realm of carefully-researched scholars! It&#39;s the &#39;z&#39; that really gets that across, wouldn&#39;t you say?) puts their top three to be Wall Street Journal, New York Times, and BBC. <br><br>Well, isn&#39;t that handy! Jolly old lists, just spread out, right for me!<br>Except, well, er, on an internet in which I don&#39;t know what to trust, I am using said internet (which I don&#39;t know what to trust on) to figure out what I&#39;m meant to trust (on the internet.)<br>But what possible group of people out there are both intelligent and not hell-bent on getting my sweet earned human teeth (which is what we use in Australia instead of currency)?!<br>The PPC!<br><br>So, what do you lot think? You agree with the particular links I found, on trustworthy news? Got your own sites or opinions on it? Do you just want to pop in and call me an idiot? I&#39;m fine with that. You can do that, if you really want. </p>

            <p>Outrage is the appropriate response to things like, e.g., murder and destruction. There is LOTS of room for subjectivity in the world, but at some point, isn&#39;t the media failing in their duty if they pretend there&#39;s a debate where there isn&#39;t, or shouldn&#39;t be? Fact-checking is extremely important, and sometimes not all sides of an issue are factually valid. I have a particular example in mind, but I don&#39;t want to make the conversation about that, so I&#39;m not going to say what it is. {= /<br><br>Anyway, I figure you can get information from just about anywhere, just as long as you keep certain things in mind. First, that there <i>is</i> a bias of one kind or another. Second, that somebody <i>is</i> trying to manipulate you for their own agenda, whether you agree with it or not. Third, somebody <i>is</i> profiting from it somehow. Fourth, not all data is created equal, and seventy-two percent of statistics are made up on the spot. I think my dad put it something like this: What do we know, how do we know it, and where&#39;s the money?<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Outrage clearly has its place, no doubt, but I was more talking about when it&#39;s exploited, y&#39;know? Pardon, for not making that more clear. Ahem. The sort of stuff like straw men, misrepresenting sides of arguments, all that sort of stuff. I suppose there&#39;s a dichotomy between presenting something that&#39;s genuinely outraging, and carefully trying to manufacture it. I mean, I can&#39;t stand that kind of thing. Straw men give my jimmies a good rustling, they do. <br><br>I&#39;m sorry I can&#39;t think of my own good, maybe less obvious example, but my homeroom teacher fellow is constantly shoving videos by Ray Comfort down our throats. These videos are <i>full</i> of that stuff, and the only person who could ever possibly find any enjoyment or reason out of it would be people who already agree with everything within them, because it panders to them, gets them all mad at the people who are &#39;incorrect&#39;. Said &#39;incorrect&#39; people, of course, having arguments misrepresented, straw men getting tossed about, all sorts of other dishonest tactics, et al. What are reasonable beliefs with reasonable backings are portrayed as absurd, immoral, and those unethical fools are then torn apart and imprisoned in the Comfort Zone, on camera, by Ray Comfort&#39;s Comfort-Ray of Justice!<br>Now, if the &#39;incorrect&#39; group <i>was</i> honestly shown and people <i>were</i> still outraged, that would be correct! That is true outrage, right there! It&#39;s being presented with something genuinely deserving of outrage, which then has people getting outraged. <br>But it&#39;s <i>not</i> outraging, is the problem. It&#39;s just sneakily put together in order to make it seem outraging. Or, er, such. <br>If you know about Ray Comfort, you probably know that he&#39;s a little goofy. But I can still respect his opinions, and I can still see where they logically come from. But that sort of dishonesty drives me up the wall. <br><br>But, yes! There certainly is genuine stuff to be outraged about, and it would probably a bit insulting, with some of those things, to try and redirect things away from them. Because they do <i>deserve</i> outrage, they do. <br><br>Also, I think I might vaguely know what your example might be, and I do apologise for bringing that sort of thing up or seemingly supporting it or such, with rubbish phrasing and general rubbishness. </p>

            <p>I didn&#39;t mean to come off as accusative, more as &quot;here is an interesting question your words have raised.&quot; My apologies also for not being more clear.<br><br>And yeah, I totally get where you&#39;re coming from. It&#39;s basically another side to the same problem, I think, of news people unscrupulously pushing a story without regard for the actual facts, reliability of data, etc. Mostly I get riled about this sort of thing when it comes to science and medicine stories, because people tend to grab onto statistically meaningless numbers and use them to insist that chocolate is great for your health, or butter is the devil, or whatever the latest trend is. Or like, the sugar industry shelling out to place all the blame for obesity on fats when it doesn&#39;t really work that way.<br><br>Or people arguing that climate change isn&#39;t happening and/or we have nothing to do with it, which is the thing I was thinking of, and am saying now because I now think being vague about it might be less helpful to a discussion.<br><br>Basically, I think we agree with each other that the news should strive to be honest and accurate, no matter its political leanings. Like, IMO, if your political party is doing something dumb, you shouldn&#39;t defend it, you should call it out so they stop being dumb, right? ... Eh?<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Welp, I think that excuses the both of us a bit, wouldn&#39;t you say? <br><br>But, ey, absolutely, there. What&#39;s wrong&#39;s wrong, ideology and such aside. I feel like a lot of people are afraid to criticise, and have criticised, people representing their own ideas, as if a single area of criticism means that their ideology is no longer &#39;good&#39; but &#39;bad&#39;, and they, themselves, are suddenly no longer &#39;good&#39;, as they thought, but &#39;bad&#39;! Or, at least, that&#39;s the case in the example I&#39;m thinking of, in which certain people <i>refuse</i> to acknowledge the horrendous situation of Indigenous Australians, as if accepting the responsibility for it and trying to support and acknowledge them will somehow make themselves, and all non-indigenous Australia (or at least all the white ones), immoral and spoiled and irreversibly evil, as a whole. <br>Which, er, is not the case. People ought to be responsible enough to admit wrongs, irrelevant of who did them, and not have a whole black and white worldview about the whole thing. Certainly, there&#39;s no good reason to be <i>dishonest</i> about things. <br><br>Also, as I read this I am eating a sugar-filled chocolate muffin. News statistics-wise, I am a health superman! </p>

            <p>The Beeb is generally decent. I usually get my news from NPR. And AP is also quite good at its job.<br><br>So yeah, AP, BBC, and NPR are my go-tos. The New York Times, Washington Post, and The Guardian are also good (well, I mostly know The Guardian from their tech reporting, particularly in regards to the Snowden leaks, so take that suggestion with a grain of salt).<br><br>In addition, I&#39;d suggest staying as far away from cable news and other TV news as humanly possible. Sure, FOX News is the one you hear about, but the others are also pretty bad.<br><br>Oh, and remember: The Daily Show is not news. It is entertainment. Yes, I know that&#39;s obvious, but in the whirling madness of cable it gets confusing, as evidenced by the fact that Jon Stewart was once voted most trusted newscaster. See why I told you to avoid the place?</p>

            <p>As a state-funded news network, the BBC is actually /required/ to avoid bias in their news. Some slips through anyway, of course - they&#39;ve shown a great deal of frustration at Twitter Personality &amp; President Trump, and they do enjoy using unflattering pictures of politicians they dislike - but by and large they do it well.<br><br>Be aware, though, that some articles are filed in things like the Magazine section, and aren&#39;t under the same rules.

            <p>He probably finds it too biased.  <br><br>The major three American Cable News Networks have all be accused of bias in some shape or form.  MSNBC in my opinion is generally very left-leaning, and portrays itself as independent and unbiased.  Fox News is incredibly right-leaning, to the point in my opinion it is borderline propaganda.  Too be fair, MSNBC is pretty much as bad.  But Fox, for the most part, never really pretended to be unbiased.  MSNBC tries to paint itself as unbiased, but isn&#39;t. <br><br>CNN is a bit more complicated.  At times people have accused them of being Left Leaning.  At a time certain individuals would call it the &quot;Clinton News Network&quot; or the &quot;Communist News Network&quot;.  As for me, I have never seen too much of an issue with CNN.  Sure their Op-Eds do tend to adopt a more liberal view, but their actual mainline reporting is fairly unbiased.  Now to be fair, American Cable News does tend to be biased in some way, all news is.  I just find CNN is balanced in comparison.  </p>

            <p>CNN has a fairly strong bias, and a variety of other problems (like poor reporting standards, and wave after wave of trivial nonsense news stories to fill a 24-hour news cycle - although that complaint can be levied at just about any network).<br><br>The thing is, &quot;by comparison,&quot; it IS much better than other TV News Networks. But that&#39;s really not saying much, now is it?<br><br>The final - and trivial - danger sign is this: 8f Jon Stewart featured you and your repoting as a topic of discussion regularly over his decade, that&#39;s generally a bad sign. :-)</p>

            <p>(I myself am aiming to grab some of my writer friends and take them here. They have some serious potential.)<br><br>Anyway, hey there! I&#39;m Twistey, a chaotic good-ish lightly-used-bie who is in a ton of fandoms (although Wolfenstein 3D, Camp Camp, and Sheep in the Big City are currently my life right now. Weird combination, I know.) I currently have a lot of original universes and some fanfiction that are works in progress, and I plan to write missions eventually. Hopefully.<br><br>Anyway, enough about me. What are you like? What do you generally write, if anything? Having had a Board conversation with Thoth in which he explained Warhammer, I know that there&#39;s got to be a good reason why he brought you here. Do you like missions? MSTs? Stuff like GAFF? I&#39;m curious to know :)<br><br>As for your newbie gift, since I often grab things from the Wolfenstein 3D fandom (haha, ask Thoth about what I gave him), and since you seem to be into the mech fighting genre, here! Have this prototype version of Hitler&#39;s mechsuit from the third episode! Complete with four chain guns, a good amount of armor, and ventilation! (And clanky sounds... Don&#39;t walk around in it near me or I might freak out. That boss fight scared me to death.)<br><br>Anyway, nice to meet you! Welcome to the Protectors of the Plot Coninuum!<br><br>-Twistey<br>----<br>(In case you need more detail about the mech suit, here&#39;s a link to the Wolfenstein Wiki page about its corresponding boss. Copy and paste the link because clicking on it won&#39;t work.)<br><br><a href="http://wolfenstein.wikia.com/wiki/Adolf_Hitler_(Wolf3D"><a href="http://wolfenstein.wikia.com/wiki/Adolf_Hitler_(Wolf3D">http://wolfenstein.wikia.com/wiki/Adolf_Hitler_(Wolf3D</a></a>)</p>

            <p>Well, hmmm....<br>I generally write Warhammer fanfiction, do a lot of RP on a MUCK. Thoth and I also have a bit of a Gundam AU going.  I&#39;ve submitted stuff to Black Library before on the Warhammer front, didn&#39;t get accepted but they at least got it to the stage where they actually looked at it.  Thoth and I also did/are working on an MST of a badfic that he read in the discord a couple days ago.<br>I like my fics like I like my canon--grimdark, but with a balancing of hope and nobledarkness in between here and there.</p>

            <p>I see you&#39;re a friend of my Pretentious Mythological Name Buddy. It&#39;s nice to have you here! I know the Author thing says &quot;The Triumvirate&quot; but nobody calls me that. It&#39;s more of a relic than anything. Call me Calliope! Or Cal. Cal is a good abbreviation.<br><br>For your gift, I present to you: a set of roleplaying dice! You can choose the color and pattern at your leisure, but try not to make it urple. Or bled. Or rue. Those colors hurt.<br><br>Because you and Thoth are friends, I present you with one gift further: a hand-written copy of the Imperial Creed. Yes, I see that Warhammer fandom - have fun with this!</p>

            <p>Well, I already recced a ton of fic, but I haven&#39;t done comics. So...<br><br>-<a href="http://localhost:3000/posts/scrape/2017/xkcd.com">xkcd</a>[NSFW]: It has recently come to my attention that at least a few boarders are as of yet unaware of one of the most popular webcomics ever. Xkcd was, is, and remains an integral part of nerd culture in many corners. Plus, while it doesn&#39;t always hit its mark, when it is funny, it is *really* funny.<br><br>-<a href="http://localhost:3000/posts/scrape/2017/undefined.net/1/0/?strip=1">1/0</a>: Yeah, I&#39;ve brought this one up before. But it&#39;s quite possibly the best piece of metafiction ever written, so I don&#39;t care. Yes, that is a bold claim. I don&#39;t care, this comic is amazing, and deep and heartfelt and raises meaningful questions about love, fiction, religion, and endings, all while delivering a fairly consistantly funny four-panel gag strip. And by comic standards, it had a very short run, so the archive is tiny.<br><br>...I was about to post more, but I just read that EME passed through the W3C and the EFF has resigned from said body, so I&#39;m a little to depressed to do it properly.</p>

            <p>And angst? I do love me some werewolf angst!<br><br>Lemme plug a couple of fics by Stoplight Delight.<br><br><a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7305052/1/Against-the-Moon">Against the Moon</a><br><i>The odds were stacked against him: a child from a blended home with no friends, no social skills to speak of, and a terrible secret. Yet slowly Remus Lupin began to discover there was a place for him in the world, if he could find the courage to claim it.</i><br><br>Currently at 132 chapters and still going strong, the fic follows Lupin from first year presumably all the way to seventh—it&#39;s still updating and is in the middle of third year right now. Stoplight loves to play with people&#39;s heartstrings and this fic really showcases how well she writes angst.<br><br><a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12646397/1/In-Desperate-Manner">In Desperate Manner</a><br><i>He could not believe it had come to this. February, 1990: late in a hard and hungry winter, Remus Lupin has come to the end of his options. Desperate in the hours before moonrise, he travels to Knockturn Alley to transact some dangerous business.</i><br><br>This is a recent addition of hers and it&#39;s even angstier than the other fic. Unable to feed himself, Lupin goes to sell his blood in Knockturn Alley just so he&#39;ll have a little bit of coin. It&#39;s only three chapters so far, but it&#39;s an amazing look at what the years before book three were like for him.<br><br>Again, this is Iximaz recommending angst, so take it with a grain of salt.</p>

<li><b><a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10658802/1/Saving-the-Dragonborn">&quot;Saving the Dragonborn&quot;</a> by SaxyGirl - K+</b></li>
<li>
<b>Continuum:</b> <i>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</i>
</li>
<li>
<b>Writing Status:</b> In Progress</li>
<li>
<b>Summary:</b> The Dragonborn has a bad habit of getting herself in sticky situations and this time is no different. Lucky for her, Farkas is available to save her. Again.</li>
<li>
<b>Why I Like It:</b> It&#39;s good clean fluffy fun (and the occasional serious moment) with one of my favorite characters. A series of one-shots in no particular order, it&#39;s not trying to be anything grand, but succeeds at being something that makes me feel good to read—and, in fact, helped inspire me to go with the muse and start writing fanfic again myself.</li>
</ul>
<br><ul>
<li><b><a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9721808/1/The-Wolf-Queen-Awakens">&quot;The Wolf Queen Awakens&quot;</a> by Ms Katonic - M</b></li>
<li>
<b>Continuum:</b> <i>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</i>
</li>
<li>
<b>Writing Status:</b> Complete</li>
<li>
<b>Summary:</b> Dragons may signify the world&#39;s end but as far as Elisif&#39;s concerned, her world ended well before that when Ulfric Stormcloak murdered her husband. So it is that no one&#39;s more surprised than her when a dragon attack on Solitude reveals that there&#39;s more to the High Queen in waiting than anyone suspected.</li>
<li>
<b>Why I Like It:</b> This is what happens when the NPCs are forced to take matters into their own hands instead of relying on a god-like PC to save them, and it&#39;s awesome. The author is extremely good at character-building, expanding on the little we know about the NPCs and giving them backstories and connections that make sense. Also at wrangling the politics of Skyrim and making the unlikeliest of allies into a crack force for saving the world. Particularly, if you&#39;re a Forsworn sympathizer, this one&#39;s for you.</li>
<br><ul>
<li><b><a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11564553/1/Fearless-Vampire-Hunters">&quot;Fearless Vampire Hunters&quot;</a> by Ms Katonic - T</b></li>
<li>
<b>Continuum:</b> <i>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</i>
</li>
<li>
<b>Writing Status:</b> Complete</li>
<li>
<b>Summary:</b> Skyrim&#39;s at peace and the Dragonborn&#39;s hung up her adventuring gear to take care of her little girl and be Queen. So when a job comes up in the Pale to look into a crypt that might be being used for arcane rites, the Companions pick it up instead, little realising Dimhollow Crypt contains far more than just beasts... Sequel to the Wolf Queen Awakens.</li>
<li>
<b>Why I Like It:</b> Athis and Cicero do <i>Dawnguard</i> with a little help from their friends, and it&#39;s hilarious and moving and awesome. I&#39;m not a fan of Cicero, don&#39;t quite get why he&#39;s so popular having not done the Dark Brotherhood questline myself, but this story makes him very entertaining and sympathetic, and it just works. Even the headcanon I don&#39;t agree with just works. May be read without having read &quot;The Wolf Queen Awakens&quot;—I did it, and never felt I was lost. Just really wanted to go back and find out how we got where we are here. Which I did. {= )</li>
</ul>
<br><ul>
<li><b><a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11820588/1/The-Age-of-the-Dragon">&quot;The Age of the Dragon&quot;</a> by Ms Katonic - M</b></li>
<li>
<b>Continua:</b> <i>TES V: Skyrim</i> x <i>Dragon Age Inquisition</i>
</li>
<li>
<b>Writing Status:</b> Complete</li>
<li>
<b>Summary:</b> The High Queen of Skyrim should have the world at her feet, but some things even a Dragonborn can&#39;t command, such as the ravages of time, rock dust and Skooma. With her beloved husband dying, and her beloved five year old miserable, Elisif risks everything to petition the gods for a miracle. Except miracles come at a very high price...</li>
<li>
<b>Why I Like It:</b> I&#39;m only on chapter 5 of this one, but it&#39;s more of what I liked about the last ones, and it&#39;s got Thedas as another continent on the opposite side of the world from Tamriel, which is interesting. I don&#39;t know much about the <i>Dragon Age</i> series, but so far, it&#39;s fun seeing the two cultures looking at each other askance and trying to figure out what to make of each other.</li>

            <p>I have a LOT of recs. I will leave off the obvious ones (I assume that you&#39;ve read OFUM, Shoebox, etc already, they&#39;re already on your reading list, or they&#39;re Just Not Your Thing), but even then, there&#39;s a LOT of stuff to recommend.<br><br>Just a note, not ALL of these are technically fanfics. Some of them or original universes, AARs, or some other sort of writing.<br><br>Other note: I&#39;m not sorting these in any way. A lot of them are Warhammer, some of them are not. Most of them are NSFW, whether that be swearing, or actual adult content. With all that out of the way:<br><br>-<a href="http://www.theallguardsmenparty.com/">The All Guardsmen Party</a>[NSFW - language]: Some of you have been following the Dark Heresy game on Discord with interest. I know I have. It&#39;s been entertaining. Now, what do you get when you crank the funny up to 11, get a truly EVIL DM, have all the players play Guardsmen, and have it all written up in third person IC by a remarkably entertaining writer? You get The All Guardsmen Party. And it is glorious.<br><br>-<a href="https://1d4chan.org/wiki/Old_Man_Henderson">Old Man Henderson</a>[NSFW]: You know how I said that I&#39;d be leaving out the obvious? I lied. Old Man Henderson is arguably the most amazing story ever recorded about a TRPG. It&#39;s funny, it&#39;s jawdropping, it&#39;s really, REALLY funny, and it ends with one of the most legendary things to ever happen in a Call Trail of Cthulhu game. I know most of you have read it, but it is basically Required Reading. So I&#39;m putting it here!<br><br>-<a href="https://1d4chan.org/wiki/The_Ballad_of_Edgardo">The Ballad of Edgardo</a>[...Might be SFW? I don&#39;t remember,so assume NSFW]: You may have noticed I have an affection for entertaining stories of RPG nonsense. This is another one. Learn about how a poorly-optimized character in a semi-freeform Forum RPG would up on a quest of mighty vengeance with a squidman. And won.<br><br>-<a href="https://1d4chan.org/wiki/Thri-Kreen_Erotica">Thri-Kreen Erotica</a>[VERY NSFW]: I love Tailsteak. Everyone here should probably know that I love Tailsteak by now, seeing how much I&#39;ve plugged 1/0 (actually, go read 1/0 right now). So when someone on 4chan&#39;s /tg/ board posted asking whether D&amp;D&#39;s Thri-Kreen were Furry (because it&#39;s 4chan), and a discussion ensued on the impossibility of writing good Thri-Kreen erotica, Tailsteak responded in a... uniquely Tailsteak fashion. It was hilarious, and somewhat disturbing.<br><br>-<a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5474237/1/40k-ToyHammer">Toyhammer</a>[Probably SFW - swears at worst]: You know, there are a few fics written about Warhammer 40k models that come to life, or the 40k factions at model scale. None of them matter save this one, because this one is just that good. It goes from wacky antics to Animorphs-esque secret war over time, and remains consistently engaging through all of it. Sadly, it hasn&#39;t updated in a while, and may never be finished. But it&#39;s still fantastic.<br><br>-<a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11122882/1/Avoiding-Stupid-Deaths-in-the-41st-Millennium">Avoiding Stupid Deaths in the 41st Millenium</a>[NSFW]: Some of you may know about TIANTDATPPC. Others of you may recall Skippy&#39;s list, or Things Mr Welch is No Longer Allowed to do in This RPG. This fic, which started as an attempt at an IG-focused 40k equivalent, became VERY different over time. It slowly developed a recurring cast of characters, an increasingly present in-universe author, and even, gradually, a storyline that I am invested enough in to check the fic for updates regularly. Cerebus has been kind of 40k fics...<br><br>-<a href="https://1d4chan.org/wiki/Story:Love_Can_Bloom">Love Can Bloom</a>[Rating Unknown: Assume NSFW]: All right, I&#39;ll admit it: I haven&#39;t had time to read Love Can Bloom yet. But it is one of the most well-known 40k fics out there, to my knowledge, had a large number of spinoffs, and is generally beloved, although sometimes somewhat controversial. And most of you probably haven&#39;t heard of it. It&#39;s the story of an Eldar Farseer (Taldeer from Dawn of War) and a Vindicare Assassin who fall in love. It has become synonymous with sweet and gentle happenings in the Grim Darkness of the 41st Millennium. I&#39;ll tell you more when I actually read it...<br><br>-<a href="https://1d4chan.org/wiki/Millennial_King">The Millenial King</a>[SFW I think...]: Necromancers get a bad rap. But do you have to be evil to be a Necromancer? /tg/ didn&#39;t think so, so they wrote this collection of stories about a good necromancer and the kingdom that he ruled.<br><br>-<a href="https://1d4chan.org/wiki/Warhammer_High">Warhammer High</a>[varies, but some NSFW]: Warhammer High is not a Warhammer 40k Highschool AU. I know it sounds like it should be, but it isn&#39;t. It&#39;s actually an AU where the Horus Heresy never happened (because The Emperor took Eldrad more seriously), and the Primarchs got daughters who all go to highschool together. I know. Somehow, the various writers at /tg/ managed to take this absolutely ludicrous concept and make some fics that are absolutely brilliant. Given, not all of these fics are great: there are parts of the written lore that are just stupid (Caliban and a lot of the other Sons) and are written poorly, and there is at least one piece of smut so eye-sporkingly bad that I may consider missioning it if I ever get Permission. It also tends to be much lighter in tone than the standard 40k fair. Having said that, <a href="https://1d4chan.org/wiki/Meet_the_Primarchs_(Warhammer_High)">Meet the Primarchs</a> is absolutely hilarious, and the alleged smutfic <a href="https://1d4chan.org/wiki/Venus%27_Burn">Venus&#39; Burn</a> is absolutely fantastic and basically the inverse of PWP to the point that I had trouble finding the smut. Actually, Someone Else&#39;s (that&#39;s really his username) work for Warhammer High in general is excellent, especially the one he wrote after Venus&#39; Burn, <a href="https://1d4chan.org/wiki/Bleeding_Out_(Warhammer_High)">Bleeding Out</a>.<br><br>-<a href="https://1d4chan.org/wiki/The_Golem%27s_Garden">The Golem&#39;s Garden</a>[SFW]: You can get my attention in two ways: You can be funny, or you can be heartwarming. This is the ladder.<br><br>-<a href="https://1d4chan.org/wiki/Marcius_Flavius">Marcius Flavius</a>[I don&#39;t remember]: One of the hardest parts about crossovers is justifying them. How do characters from one world find themselves in another? Thankfully, 40k has a built-in answer: Warp Shenanigans. Not that this fic needs it, it&#39;s too funny to be bogged down by that. But I digress. Star Trek&#39;s Federation, and 40k&#39;s Imperium: Never were there two spacefaring civilizations in sci-fi more different. So what happens why they collide? Well, in this case, they organize a cultural exchange program, and hilarity ensues: Riker becomes an honorary Space Marine, and Marcius Flavius of the Imperial Fists is put under Picard. Neither deals with their new allies well...<br><br><a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6226554/1/Confessions-of-a-Wayward-Son">Confessions of a Wayward Son</a>[SFW]: I&#39;m a Sons player, and they&#39;re probably my all-time favorite faction, so I&#39;m biased on this one. Anyways, one type of 40k fic we see a lot of is the idea of the Chaos Space Marine who ends up changing his allegiances and fighting for The Imperium once more, kind of Drizzt-style, except hopefully not as Sue-ish. This actually kind of makes sense: There are some Marines in the Traitor Legions that never really wanted what happened. Like, to pick a <i>completely</i> random example, a good chunk of the Thousand Sons - although they hate the Imperium more. So what happens when a Son decides that Magnus was *definitely* wrong, and the Imperium was right to do what they did? Well, you get this fic. Some would say it&#39;s too angsty (and I have been known to mock the angst myself), and it certainly has some flaws here and there, but I never claimed that I had some highly developed taste in fic. At the end of the day, I like it. YMMV.</p>

            <p>In most fandoms, you read the source material before you read the wikis, fanfic, etc. In 40k, this is not necessarily true: Warhammer 40k&#39;s high cost and obscurity mean that many fans will start by reading wikis or fanworks. And with the dizzying scope of the universe, it&#39;s easy to get lost.<br><br>So, I want to take a moment to introduce to you one of the first 40k fanworks I ever really experienced, and one that cemented my interest in the setting: <a href="https://youtube.com/user/alfabusa">If The Emperor Had A Text-To-Speech Device</a>[NSFW].<br><br>From its first episode, TTS was... okay, the first episode was kinda rubbish. It was basically an excuse to spend 5 minutes having the Emperor mock the Grey Knights, the Ultramarines, and the general state of the Imperium, setting the tone for the episodes that would follow. However, as time went on, the show&#39;s production values and attention to the lore increased, and it became something a lot more interesting. By the dawn of Season 2, it had moved towards telling a more serious story... a more serious story where the main players were an Australian wizard, and insufferably literal individual, an overly emotional Custodes, three walking innuendos, and a grumpy constantly-swearing definitely-not-god who&#39;s in a state of eternal torment, but a more serious story nonetheless.<br><br>Also, later TTS is shockingly educational for a comedy series. Educational about 40k lore, yes, but educational nonetheless. I hold Episode 19 as a crowning achievement, explaining what The Warp is, how it functions and the nature of the Chaos Gods to a fairly-accurate degree (well, as accurate as you CAN be, seeing as it changes, and with the characters in question discussing it), being IMHO one of the best explanations of the subject ever.<br><br>It also has a fantastic spinoff podcast...<br><br>Anyways, I may be overselling it bit, but TTS is absolutely worth watching. If only to find out why I keep nicking myself ROGAL DORN in Discord.<br><br>And did I mention the characters play Yugioh? WIND-UP KITTEN, IN ATTACK MODE!</p>

            <p>It&#39;s mainly about Worm since that&#39;s what I&#39;ve been reading recently, but not all.<br><br>The recs are all about an author posting on Spacebattles and Sufficient Velocity, Cerulean.<br><br>His first work for Worm, in hiatus for now, is <a href="https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/atonement-worm-au.312449/">Atonement</a>. This is an AU starting up with the locker scene... And Taylor&#39;s death, putting the focus on another character, Madison as she triggers out of guilt and decides to, well atone, by being a hero. Cerulean takes an one-notice character, and manage to create an excellent story.<br><br>Next, my favorite, his other Worm AU, <a href="https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/intrepid-worm-au.337516/">Intrepid</a>. The initial premise is similar to Atonement, with a worst-than-canon locker scene for Taylor (although more AU elements can be spotted as the story continues, no spoilers here), leading here some girls of the bullying trio, Madison and Emma, to trigger when they realize just how ducked-up was their behavior, before going to cape life. The fic alternates between them, Taylor and Sophia Hess. It&#39;s in my opinion an even better story than the former, updates roughly once a week, and includes a... spin-off I guess, <a href="https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/odyssey-vista-centric-worm-au.445787/">Odyssey</a>, from Vista&#39;s POV, although it&#39;s also canon to this story. A sort of fifth POV, I guess?<br><br>But Cerulean also writes original fiction. Namely, an urban fantasy web-novel called <a href="https://ceruleanscrawling.wordpress.com/">Heretical Edge</a>, updating twice a week. The story is about Flick Chambers, a young girl who just got selected to be part of a monster-hunting school. Still, expect a few surprises, here because this premise let to a really interesting &#39;verse.</p>

            <p>You know, it actually has absolutely nothing to do with Star Trek? I mean, the story has barely anything to do with My Little Pony, but there is truly, POSITIVELY, no reason it is called Starfleet Magic.<br><br>Yes, I have had my eye on this sherries for a while. You may recognize it under the former name: My Little Unicorn: Magic is Believing. If you have never heard of this infamous fic, look at the <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/MyBravePonyStarfleetMagic?from=FanFic.MyLittleUnicorn">TvTropes Page</a> for it.<br><br>Yes, I do still fully intend on tackling the thing. Even after all these years. I will do it. I swear.<br><br>And yes, that little detail with the sparkle blood will be included in the mission. It&#39;s too funny not to.</p>
