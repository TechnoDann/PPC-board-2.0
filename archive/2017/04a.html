            <p>So, I&#39;m working on an idea for a support character for the PPC to use in my stories for when I get permission, and I have a few questions for you guys, gals and general PPCers:<br><br>1. Who actually runs the Armoury these days? The wiki says Zim, but I haven&#39;t found any mention of either him nor the Armoury in a very long time. <br><br>2. Is the idea of a sentient, English-speaking Australopithecus too wacky for the PPC, or would I be allowed to do it? <br><br>3. Does the Armoury keep power armour in its inventory? </p>

            <p>... but not outplanned. <br><br>Thinking circles around the enemy is what the PPC does best, not blowing them away with BFGs. Just something to keep in mind. {= )<br><br>To actually answer your questions:<br><br>1. It&#39;s still Zim. Centaurs live a pretty long time, I reckon. Also, I believe he was created by Delta Juliette (formerly known as Techno-Dann) and she&#39;s still around, so it would be fairly rude to just up and oust him. Generally speaking, it&#39;s best to show respect to what came before you.<br><br>2. We&#39;ve had sentient, English-speaking dinosaurs, Pokémon, and at one point a vending machine. An actual hominid is practically <i>tame</i>.<br><br>3. It&#39;s possible someone might&#39;ve picked some up in a fic and pawned it off for something they could actually use in a job that requires stealth, I suppose. I like the idea of your Australopithecus using it as a jungle gym cum stress ball, too. Rule of Funny says yes!<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Aye, Zim was my creation - you are welcome to write him as you see fit, he got basically zero characterization in my work. He&#39;s strong enough to move the heavy ordinance around, stable and mature enough to be trusted with the heavy ordinance, and beyond that, he&#39;s completely up to you.</p>

            <p>Cool. Thanks, I just needed to know who she reports to. The BFG&#39;s are just there &quot;in case of emergency&quot;, much like the tanks, artillery shells and clown masks. They&#39;d be gathering dust if Lucy wasn&#39;t polishing them regularly. </p>

            <p>It&#39;s not a Fallout character, but I&#39;d imagine a few suits of T-51b would come in handy. <br><br>The character I&#39;m creating is one of the Armoury staff, an ape called Lucy who has a slight fascination with big guns and likes to climb over the armour and hit it with a wrench when she gets stressed. I was asking about the Armoury because I&#39;m not sure if I can make her the head or just a senior agent. </p>

            <p>Unless she&#39;s actually <i>the</i> Lucy, it might be more interesting to give her a name that sounds like an australopithecine might have it. More interesting, though Lucy could always be a nickname.<br><br>You can actually find sentient English-speaking australopithecines in at least one canon - the <i>Engines of Light</i> trilogy by Ken Macleod.

            <p>What you do is, you stand them on a thin metal floor, like aluminium or something, then you put a landmine underneath it, wait for them to step on it and hear the click... and <i>that&#39;s</i> when you start to torture them. Psychological torture too, none of this nimby-pimby blood all over the walls nonsense <i>some</i> people espouse. No, you make them terrified. You make them fear for their very existence. That way, you make them dance to your tune. Nobody else&#39;s. Just yours. You put in verbal, physical, and environmental triggers too, so even if some do-gooding sissy little wetpants does end up screwing up your plans for the day and neuralyzing away the torture, the implanted triggers will still turn them completely out of character. My favourite was when I made good old Legolas wet himself at the sight of a bow. Heh. Goooooooood times.</p>

            <p>Because let&#39;s face it, your agents can&#39;t be good agents if they don&#39;t look good while doing their jobs. For example, in my lastest mission, the Aviator was wearing some really cool combat camo things (I don&#39;t know the names of them lol), then she had to seduce the Doctor and wore a dress kinda like Rose&#39;s from that one Doctor Who episode, but it was red and had sequins, and then later she was wearing skinny jeans with rhinestones on them, and black combat boots with silver studs, and a purple tank top that says &quot;Pilot&quot; across the front, and a black and red leather jacket with a really cool bloody dripping rose on the back. <br><br>But I&#39;m having trouble deciding what she should wear for the final showdown with the main character. Should I give her a miniskirt and thigh-high boots, or leggings and really cute pumps?<br><br>Also, share your favorite agent costumes!! I need ideas!!!!!</p>

            <p>I guess I was just thinking of the effects of a bad fanfic, then. Plus the fact that there&#39;s dispensers of Bleeprin everywhere and a Bleeprin version of everything? My idea is that it probably would make sense that some nameless, faceless NPC has a Bleep addiction, it&#39;s just that the PPCers themselves seem to steer clear of making their agents Bleep addicted due to the fact that drug addictions are a serious topic and easily trivialized or turned into offensive humor. (Which I respect completely.)<br><br>About the agent: Yes, I do know that. (For once I know something. Take that, everyone! Haha!) If I join, I&#39;m the PPCer, not the agent. The agent is the character I create for missions. However, my characters-that-were-going-to-be-agents are somewhat based on me, much like many folks&#39; agents are (probably because it&#39;s really hard not to want to directly feel the satisfaction of killing off a badfic, instead of having to distance yourself from the character and not feel quite as strong.)<br><br>I&#39;m guessing that what suggested that idea to you was that I mention how &quot;I can&#39;t really join&quot; and stuff? Yeah. I can&#39;t be a PPCer, or at the very least, since you say that being active makes you a PPCer, I&#39;ll have to be a secret one. I just can&#39;t let them know that I&#39;m here. All because killing fanfic hurts authors&#39; precious little feelings. (Even though bad fanfic hurts feelings too - ahem: trivialization, blatantly discriminatory authors, and tragic backstories done horribly wrong.) So yeah.

            <p>I&#39;m pretty sure I have yet to see an outright Bleep addiction, though there certainly are overdose effects (mainly to do with memory issues, IIRC). Also, now I&#39;ve started thinking about the Bleep versions of things that haven&#39;t really shown up yet, and...Bleepotatoes? That is, mashed potatoes with Bleep in them? How about Bleepizza? I&#39;d totally go for that. And what about Bleepfries with...hm. Ketchbleep? Ketcheep? Ketcheep is probably the best name I&#39;m going to come up with right now. Might be a little harder to manufacture food with mixed in Bleeprin--for one thing, it wouldn&#39;t keep as long or as well--but I&#39;d be very amused to at least see an agent joking about it sometime. Because, really, there kind of is a Bleep version of everything...at least, where &#39;everything&#39; means painkillers, candy, and alcohol or coffee.<br><br>Re: terminology...<br><br>PPCer, in my experience, tends to mean a Boarder. I suppose an agent might use it as well, but the general usage I&#39;ve seen has been for Boarders (whether they&#39;ve written missions or not!). Feel free to correct me if you&#39;ve seen it used differently, though.<br><br>(The Wiki, meanwhile, actually says it <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/PPC_Member">refers to both</a> Boarders and agents, which does make sense. I do wonder what the current usage is, though, and whether Boarders or agents are currently more likely to be referred to as PPCers...maybe that should be a question in the PPC Survey, when it returns?)<br><br><a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Boarder">Boarder</a> is used for, well, a Boarder: a real, living person who makes posts on this PPC Board. Again, this applies to everyone regardless of whether or not they have Permission. I am a Boarder; Huinesoron is a Boarder; the newbies are Boarders. I&#39;d say that intention to stick around for at least a little while (and also posting, of course) is the main criterion for being a Boarder, though if someone feels differently, they&#39;re of course welcome to put in their own definition.<br><br>And lastly, <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Agent">an agent</a>, as you said, is a character created for missions (and/or just general life in the PPC canon!) This character might be based on you (a self-insert or a semi-self-insert), or an original character, or an original character based on a recruited/rescued bit character or character replacement or even reformed Sue. Plenty of options.<br><br>I...don&#39;t think I follow your last paragraph very well, though that may be because I&#39;m getting rather tired by now (long and busy day, this was). Your post below (which is the main one I&#39;m replying to, actually) says you meant &#39;PPCer&#39; as &#39;Boarder&#39; here, but...that&#39;s not making it any clearer for me, since it sounds more like you&#39;re talking about agents. Would you mind further clarifying or rephrasing?<br><br>Thanks and goodnight (and I hope the terminology definitions helped),<br><br>~Zing</p>

            <p>Oh gosh, more Bleep stuff... Everybody seems to have a thing for that thing... (After thinking about Ketcheep for a while, I suddenly thought it sounded like a... weird ship... I&#39;ll spare you.)<br><br>Okay, so I got the term correctish there! Yay! I&#39;m pretty sure I know what Boarders and agents are, and you are right that there&#39;s a lot of other ways to make an agent - just as there are lots of other ways to make any sort of character, and in fact self-inserts are kind of eschewed (you probably know this already.)<br><br>And about my last paragraph, your agent may be doing the killing of the fic, but you still wrote the spork. You&#39;re going to be the one that the author screeches at if they find the spork. Their precious little feelings will be essentially hurt by you, not the agent.

            <p>Sunglasses are soooooo coooool their the cooooolest things ever. i once made a big fridge out of sunlgasses and i put some pasta and some chicken and some beans in it to stay cool and wehn i opened it the next day, there was nothing but ice! So i put it into a drink and the drink was delicious but it tasted kiind of like pasta chicken and beans but thats fine.<br><br>what i&#39;m saying is: SUYNGLASSES. <br>And not just on eyes too. i kidnapped three scientists to examin this and they determined (after they stopped tyring to call their familys or whatever some dumb stuff) that sugnglasses are cool because they COVER the eyes and make it mysterious. What could be behind them?! It could be anything, which is why its so cool It might be eyes, but then they might be knives or lasterguns or sockets or icicles or katanas or eyes but RED eyes that are glowing!!!! And they fall out and their katanas that are STILL GLOWING RED!!!!!<br><br>so if just covering eyes with sunglasses is cool then covering MORE with sunglasses is even cooler. SO my next missun has Yocherry but instead of wearing shorts and a coat he wears SUNGLASSSes. HUGE sunglasses and the only thing that you can see of him is his ankle, and that&#39;s okay because the ankle is the cooles part of the body and  its still cool even not-coverd</p>

I just need to write the opening post, and then we&#39;re good to go. Look out for it within the next week or two.<br><br>And with that, good night unto you all (except in cases where it&#39;s morning or afternoon),<br>Zingenmir</p>

She starts out meh, becomes shallow, then [censored], then insane, like she&#39;s grinding her Evil stat. :P Anyways, it was decidedly enjoyable, especially because I became more and more sure of the outcome as she became worse and worse, and then I discovered the rug had been yanked out from underneath me. So, of course, now I have to find my footing before I can skedaddle and design costumes for Purim, which is apparently a thing that is done. <i>Is excited for this.</i> </p>

It&#39;s everything I wanted and more! *spins around gleefully*<br><br>Ahem. Yes.<br><br>I did have fun writing the twist, although it was also hard to kill off a character that I both like and have no actual current intention of killing in canon. Overall, though, this particular fake mission was both interesting and fun to write. Twisting everything while knowing that Dawn <i>wasn&#39;t</i> going to set it right in the end...it&#39;s very different, and, well, kind of a lot like doing the badfic games, actually!<br><br>As for your second paragraph...yeah, from my perspective that was definitely intentional, but from the imaginary fanfic writer&#39;s perspective it was probably more along the lines of &#39;she starts out ordinary but special, builds a relationship with Oliver, anD THEN SHE GETS COOL POWERS SO SHE CAN TAKE OUT THAT STUPID CLINGY LAUREL AND THEN SHE&#39;S GOING TO GET THAT COOL MAGIC FROM ONCE UPON A TIME BECAUSE YOU&#39;D TOTALLY NEED MORE THAN JUST CONTROLLING METAL TO PROPERLY BEAT DEATHSTROKE COME ON.&#39; So yes. From the imaginary writer&#39;s perspective, she was probably meant to...well, to go from semi-ordinary (if increasingly rather lucky) to extraordinary in the best way. Unfortunately, it doesn&#39;t really come across that way. Not to mention the many tense changes...<br><br>In conclusion: I&#39;m glad you enjoyed it (and that you were surprised, of course, since that was my intention). As for the Purim RP, it&#39;s probably going to go up <i>after</i> Pesach (aka Passover) by now; so, after at least a couple more days. On the other hand, it might go up tomorrow, but I may hold off so that I&#39;ll actually be able to participate too. That would be nice. It is going to happen, though, despite the longer than usual delay.<br><br>Thanks for the review!<br><br>~Zing</p>

I was going to say that &#39;mission through the Suvian&#39;s eyes&#39; isn&#39;t something that would work with an actual badfic, but I don&#39;t think that&#39;s even true. It wouldn&#39;t work with a <i>first person</i> badfic - though even then you could use a secondary character for your viewpoint - but something you can Sue&#39;s-eye-view up... is actually a very interesting concept.

            <p>My dear hS, your spoiler block is most amusing. I shall try one of my own, since I suspect it might be a good idea.<br><br><i>Gil-galad was a spoiler block<br>of him the spoilers sadly block<br>the last whose block was fair and strong<br>between the spoilers and the throng.<br><br>His block was thick, his lance was keen.<br>His shining helm afar was seen;<br>the countless spoilers of fiction&#39;s field<br>were hidden deep within his shield.<br><br>But long ago he rode away,<br>and where he dwelleth none can say;<br>for into darkness fell his star<br>in Badfic where the shadows are.</i><br><br>...and, now that I want to actually maybe write a drabble about that...<br><br>I&#39;m so glad I shocked you! I ran with the idea of the agent not surviving, despite how hard it was to actually write, because, well, it really is unusual! And fun! You don&#39;t get to do it very frequently, because really, how often can you kill off your main characters? Unless, of course, you keep bringing them back...which then leaves you with the <i>Supernatural</i> effect, wherein you lose tension because the audience <i>knows</i> by now that the three main characters are probably never going to be permanently killed off. So it was very fun. Despite the fact that actually writing a death scene for Dawn was kind of difficult--not from the mechanics of it, really, but mainly because I&#39;m not actually planning to kill her off anytime soon.<br><br>As for concrit...sure! Good stuff, that, no matter the season.<br><br>1. No, I didn&#39;t post it on April 1st, though I did start writing it then! I think I mentioned somewhere that April crept up on me? Well, it <i>really</i> crept up on me. I hadn&#39;t given an AFD story any real thought in the preceding few weeks. I still really wanted to do something, though. Unfortunately, I finished in the early morning hours of April 2nd, and while I liked what I&#39;d written, it&#39;s so far off what I generally write for the PPC that I wanted to both look it over myself while awake and get some other opinions. So I waited. And it&#39;s just as well that I did, because I got to make some good edits that way. And, of course, the beta comments were pure gold.<br><br>2. Annalise...yeah. She is meant to sort of build gradually, with the hints that in future chapters she&#39;ll go even further off the rails. She warps the characters very OOC, changes tenses a lot, and has made the whole thing exist in a somewhat nebulous time setting--it&#39;s <i>probably</i> set pre-series, but at the same time Robert Queen is never mentioned (and the same with Laurel and Sarah&#39;s mother), and it&#39;s just...well, it&#39;s meant to feel off, especially if you know the show at all. But hopefully also at least somewhat if you don&#39;t know it. She is meant to be not the worst of the worst until she jumps the shark with the X-Men powers, though.<br><br>3. I can&#39;t take credit for the original idea, actually--I&#39;m pretty sure I&#39;ve at least seen the concept discussed before--but...hm. I do have an old and unfinished thing for a Sue in the process of being reformed, but I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s going to be continued anytime too soon. I also love Mary-Sue parodies, and should continue mine at some point (I used a chapter of it for my Permission piece, actually), but even that isn&#39;t really from the Sue&#39;s perspective. I suppose it&#39;ll really depend on whether or not I find a badfic that would work with it?<br><br>Something that would be interesting and perhaps more easily done, however, is to tell a mission through the POV of a character who&#39;s been warped OOC. I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;d work better or worse with someone who&#39;s extremely OOC than with someone who&#39;s only somewhat OOC and watching everyone else act weirdly with confusion, but...hm. I think I&#39;ll keep an eye out for this sort of thing as well.<br><br>Anyway, hope I&#39;ve answered everything...and thanks for the review!<br><br>~Zing</p>

Why did I do that? If we could&#39;ve just TALKED a little more...&quot;<br><br>Suta: &quot;Hey, at least I barely made it into the top ten. And really, didn&#39;t you even listen to what I told you before I barreled at you at top speed?&quot;<br><br>Backslash: &quot;Mouth-first, mind. I reacted on instinct and muscle memory from <i>Dino Crisis.</i>&quot;<br><br>Suta: &quot;Pfff. Yeah, my bad for making an awful first impression. But really, it was gonna be down to either you or me if we both ended up being the top two. I didn&#39;t want you having to make that choice. Though to be fair, I DID have my stomach in mind when I made it for you. Sorry &#39;bout that!&quot;<br><br>Backslash: &quot;But... But I thought we were from the same district!&quot;<br><br>Suta: &quot;Knowing everything else that&#39;s happened thus far, districts are a moot point by now. It&#39;s everybody for themselves, like it or not.&quot;<br><br>Backslash: &quot;Dear Bionis...&quot; *He buries his face in his hands and scarf.* &quot;So, uh, no hard feelings, right?&quot;<br><br>Suta: &quot;Not at all, actually. I had a lot of fun with these games - I made a few friends, got to find out what you furry thingies taste like (blech)... and really, there were others around here who went down in less dignified ways. Anyway, best of luck to ya, mammal guy! I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll do great in the last few rounds!&quot;<br><br>Backslash: &quot;I just hope I don&#39;t die to poisoning. Steel-type immunity and all.&quot;<br><br>Suta: &quot;Don&#39;t worry. Just keep suriving and doing what you&#39;re doing and who knows, you may even win! I&#39;d knock on wood but, well... I&#39;ve got a big head and little arms...&quot; *She winks, teeth bared.*<br><br>Backslash: &quot;Was that a reference to something I don&#39;t know?&quot;<br><br>Suta: *smirks* &quot;Yes, indeed it was.&quot;</p>

            <p>Apollo: (noticeably out of breath) Who the [BEEP] thought it was a good idea to put goblins in this? Nasty little buggers almost killed me, and THEN I was captured by one of the others, thankfully that second attempt to force another tribute to choose between me and someone else went as well as the first one did, although this time for the bastard who got me. Didn&#39;t realise it was my dragon friend until after she&#39;d helped me escape, all I can say is that hobbit knows how to do her knots. <br><br>Kaatah: So I found out how to play Solitaire. That&#39;s a good thing, right? Spent most of my time doing that, waiting for part of my grand plan to come together, and then two other tributes came along and I went to hunt with them, I mean I was looking more for parts than people to kill, but I managed to survive it. </p>

            <p>It&#39;s been astonishingly difficult working up the motivation to write the episodes (which is why they keep being both late and weird - &#39;Dafydd talks to camera&#39; is just dull), so it&#39;s good to know the effort has been worthwhile. :)<br><br>hS</p>

I&#39;m not interested in winning this game, but I won&#39;t miss it once I get inevitably bumped off.&quot;<br><br>Suta: &quot;Well, there&#39;s one thing I never thought I&#39;d have fun doing - taking people for rides on my back! I&#39;m sure Apollo and Saki had a lot of fun while they were with me. Lemme make this clear, though... I&#39;m nobody&#39;s Yoshi. If I can get the chance to eat you guys, I will. Consider yourselves warned!&quot;<br><br>(Poor, poor E.V.L. X&#39;D Didn&#39;t even get the dignity of dying while fighting someone else, either. Rayner is <i>never</i> gonna let her live this down...)</p>

            <p>Not often anyone wants to hear about Jack—my fault for letting the Detective steal the show like the drama queen he is. <br><br>Jack&#39;s a hunter who&#39;s been killing creatures scarier than anything in here since he was twelve, trying to keep people safe, and has, even more frighteningly, managed to keep himself <i>nice.</i> <br><br>The idea that I&#39;ve been developing since he&#39;s been in the games (and only recently become aware of) is that the Games are very much like the hunting life. Paranoid, sleeping rough, and making sure your goal isn&#39;t winning, just surviving. The PPC is kind of a nice place for him. <br><br>He went nuts a long time ago—considering his backstory, it&#39;s more implausible that he <i>wouldn&#39;t</i> have, but he&#39;s a stoic who keeps the whole angst deal under wraps because it gets in the way of his job. <br><br>Jack&#39;s a professional killer, like all hunters. He just doesn&#39;t act like one. <br><br>—Aegis, who is really working very hard to curb his Edgelord tendencies, honest.</p>

            <p>E.V.L.: &quot;Finally! I was wondering how soon it would be before I actually managed to kill someone. It was also nice of Suta to help me deal with Michael, because he was putting up quite a struggle before she literally stepped in - and ON him, no less. And Suta, you&#39;re welcome for the snack. You needed the meat, I needed the blood. Win-win!&quot;<br><br>Cupid: &quot;Honestly, that should&#39;ve been me snuggling with the Rat-Catcher that day. He looked so warm! I don&#39;t know if Jack was as willing to be a temporary cuddle-buddy, though - heck, I don&#39;t know if ANYBODY would at a time like this! *Sigh*... Steph, if you&#39;re watching this, can I sleep at your place tonight? Please??&quot;<br><br>Backslash: &quot;I swear, if I have to go through ONE more embarrassing situation before I inevitably get killed off... Ugh. I hope Whitney doesn&#39;t get any ideas from this...&quot;<br><br>Suta: &quot;So that&#39;s what humans taste like. A lot like those little mammals I used to have as a hatchling, but skinnier and bonier. In short, major props to E.V.L. for helping me avoid starvation, but just this once, because people just aren&#39;t nice to eat. Why Big Jaws in other media always try to eat you mammals instead of bigger game, I have no idea.&quot;</p>

With the sun came food, which was welcome although not as welcome as a hatchet would have been, still it hasn&#39;t been too eventful for me so far. <br><br>Kelly: Had a rubbish ally last night, they let us get robbed, so I ditched them in the morning and found my friend from the start again.

Ran into a trio of others in the morning and we set off to hunt others, that was fun, but I can&#39;t help but think this&#39;ll end badly. </p>

I did my best to sleep, but neither Dax nor Cupid seemed interested in doing so. It was, however, something of a relief just to be relaxing, instead of worrying about my safety for a change, and both are quite entertaining, so while I did eventually grow rather curt, I&#39;m afraid, it was still enjoyable on the whole. Oh, the Arena? I was attempting to create a place to sleep. Foolish, I know, but such things happen when one is tired. Thankfully, the situation has been remedied- for now, at least.</p>

But, I am here, and I can provide a calm, collected head with which to analyze a situation. Therefore, I think I can go far in this competition.<br><br>Anneli: Like, ow. I never want to be burned alive again. That was, like, the worst thing ever. And dangit, I wanted to do what my RC sporks!<br><br>Cindy: Well, that&#39;ll show me to talk about my spellcasting when they take my wand out before I go in there.

            <p>And you&#39;ll get a double whammy of them as well (seeing as I don&#39;t know where else to put the Post-Qualifier interviews).<br><br>Post Qualifier.<br><br>Apollo: The qualifier was fun, well if you count a day and a half by yourself fun. I grabbed a bag from the centre and then sprinted out of there, mainly because by the time I got there I was kinda scared of staying to long and getting killed, Theo looked like he wanted to do that but the guys he teamed up with kinda kept him occupied which I&#39;m thankful for. Had a great time hunting, then a less great time at night when I got my foot stuck in a rabbit hole. Thankfully no one heard me and I survived the night, and the qualifiers. So, yeah it was all good.<br><br>Kelly: I&#39;m so sorry Ami, but I needed that bag, or at least I thought I saw some Celestial bronze in there. Turns out it wasn&#39;t, but I really thought I needed it at the time. Seemed to spend the rest of the qualifier alone which wasn&#39;t bad, found some flowers that unfortunately couldn&#39;t come out of the arena... I wonder if I can get some of them from the organisers...<br><br>Theo: THAT WAS AWESOME! Every Mandalorian should do that, thought about killing Apollo at the start, but I&#39;d built up an alliance with a couple of others somehow that kept me distracted, and then our daytime raid was brilliant, even if the guy wasn&#39;t home we were all professional in our ransacking of it. I went my own way at night to try and get a kill and then I didn&#39;t need to because it was all over. Bring on the actual event!<br><br>Kaatah: I didn&#39;t want to get into any trouble at the start and just tried to survive by myself, I met with a couple of others around nightfall and we decided to have a truce which was nice. And then we were attacked, I&#39;ve fought alongside a lot of others before but this must of been one of the toughest fights I&#39;ve had, I&#39;m so glad I wasn&#39;t alone, although I didn&#39;t want to kill them they left me no choice. <br><br>Actual Games Day 1<br><br>Apollo: Yeah, so I&#39;m kind of sorry for that Levy, but it needed to be done. Still I managed to get into and out of the cornucopia unharmed which is good. Managed to nick a bit of food from that hologram, not sure why she needed the food but I&#39;m grateful she had it. Hopefully I&#39;ll find someone in a position to kill soon, I&#39;d rather not let Kataah win our own competition without a challenge. <br><br>Kelly: Found a real nice guy who agreed to share some stuff with me, I gave him my RC number just in case. I mean it was kind of a fair deal for me getting the actual backpack. So that was good. The rest of the day wasn&#39;t as great, I found out about the quarters the hard way, I wasn&#39;t exactly trying to smuggle the stuff from one part to another, I just didn&#39;t realise the boundary existed. Oh well, at least I didn&#39;t die. <br><br>Theo: No comment.<br><br>Kataah: Running worked in the qualifiers and it worked again. I&#39;m so grateful for The Sunflower&#39;s Witness, I never heard Albert coming, although I&#39;ll admit it was a bit weird thanking a sentient flower for help, they normally don&#39;t do things like that. <br></p>

            <p>((OOC: As requested by hS. I&#39;ve added a little something to… well, add a little something.))<br><br><b>Holo-Acacia</b>: Right out of the gate, someone tries to jump me! Well, that might have worked on Holo-Jay, but I&#39;m not exactly a stranger to this. A little bit of improvised teamwork, and two competitors are already out of the way.<br><br>Also, someone stole my food. Good thing I don&#39;t need to eat, or else I&#39;d be pretty hacked off.<br><br>~~~~~~~~~~<br><br><i>Rather than one of the four quadrants of the current Hunger Games, this camera seems to be set in a rather spartan lab. There are two individuals standing in view, with a third sitting at a nearby computer. All of them are wearing black lab coats with DoSAT patches. The one closest to the camera, a tanned, middle-aged woman with greying hair tied into a bedraggled bun, clears her throat.</i><br><br>DStA: Hello to you, fine viewers! My name is Dr. Daphne St. Auguste, of the Testing and Application Division in the Department of Sufficiently Advanced Technology. These are my colleagues: Tess Jachowicz— <br><br><i>She gestures to a younger woman with braided brown hair and glasses standing behind her.</i><br><br>TJ: A pleasure!<br><br>DStA: —and Naas&#39;Gehlen vas Headquarters.<br><br><i>She points over at a male quarian typing away at the computer, who gives a casual salute without looking over at the camera.</i><br><br>DStA: We are the team behind Holo-Jay and Holo-Acacia. The technology was originally meant to supplement agents working in the field, but apparently there were &quot;concerns&quot; about dispatching holograms.<br><br>TJ: Along with complaints from the Friends of AI Society.<br><br>DStA: Which were ridiculous! The holograms are not &quot;true&quot; AI. A true AI would have the capability to self-rationalize and expand beyond—<br><br>TJ: Ah, ma&#39;am? You&#39;re starting to ramble.<br><br>DStA: Was I?<br><br>NGvH: <i>*without looking around*</i> Yup.<br><br>DStA: All right, very well. As I was saying before, we are the team behind Holo-Jay and Holo-Acacia. And while Holo-Jay has fallen a bit short of our expectations—<br><br><i>Naas&#39;Gehlen snorts. Daphne shoots him a quick glare.</i><br><br>DStA: We are quite confident in the performance of Holo-Acacia. Not only have we incorporated all the data acquired from its performance in the previous games into the current model, we have also taken steps to make its personality more like the original Acacia.<br><br>TJ: It was sort of just on a default mode last time.<br><br>DStA: In any event, we are quite confident in our creation and hope that it can win some fans! And perhaps a bit of support from the Board for our proposals.<br><br>NGvH: You said that last part out loud, doc. <br><br>DStA: What&#39;s your point?<br><br><i>The camera feed ends.</i></p>

But just before the buzzer goes off, I see it: the jetpack. I don&#39;t have time to think anymore, so I just go for it. It&#39;s total chaos; it&#39;s like <i>everyone</i> was in there, which is nuts, right? But I make it! I grab this thing, I pull it on, and I&#39;m trying to figure out how it works when I see something coming at me from the corner of my eye. I&#39;m like, &quot;oh, crap, I&#39;m done for!&quot;, but then I hit the button, and I am <i>out of there!</i> Whoooo! What a rush! I am so sad it only had enough juice to get me to the SciFi Sector, you have no idea. But hey, best place to maybe find another one, right?<br><br>Unless I find that dragon first.

            <p><b>Keiko</b><br><br>... I really, really suck at this. Last time I placed forty-fifth, this time I didn&#39;t even get past the qualifiers. Serves me well for getting involved in an ill-planned ambush and trying to use throwing knives without practicing first, I guess. I would&#39;ve liked to team up with the others, but I only found Saki and she ran away!<br><br>Now, excuse me but I really need to have my Remote Activator looked into.

Especially since someone had the great idea to raid my gear. I&#39;m surprised to hear Keiko didn&#39;t make it through - while she hasn&#39;t seen war like Saki and I did, she&#39;s not bad in a fight as far as I could see.<br><br><b>Saki</b><br><br>Aww, I missed all the action! Well, aside when Keiko was chasing me... did she want to get revenge for me eating all of that icecream by myself? Anyways, I met nice people and got through, so it&#39;s all good!<br><br><b>Ami</b><br><br>... I got through? Looks like I was saved just in time by the end of the qualifiers, as I was in pretty bad shape. I wish something like that could happen when I was dying &gt;for real, but, well..<br><br>Anyways, I dropped the fight with Kelly pretty quickly, I know - I&#39;m a sniper, not a martial artist, and I cut myself while making a spear, the wound got infected and... well, you know the rest. I&#39;m quite rusty, what with having been dead and all...</p>

            <p>Keiko seems to have a knack for mirroring her parents&#39; demises - in her first partecipation, she placed exactly like her mother did, and this time she went out with a failed ambush just like her father did in the third edition.<br><br>Shiro acted just like I expected him to - keep a low profile, and strike when he sees a good chance.<br><br>Saki... well, she seems to have made friends pretty quickly. Was she using the fact that she looks cute and innocent like Sakura Kinomoto to her advantage?<br><br>Ami having to withdraw from a struggle for equopment makes perfectly sense - she&#39;s quite small physically, and she is trained as a sniper so close quarters is pretty much the opposite of what she can do well. Sicne she likely hasn&#39;t got her rifle in there, her making a spear to fight makes sense.</p>

            <p><b>Gabrielle (<font color="#FF0000">ELIMINATED: 50th PLACE</font>):</b> Uuuum, that was way less fun than I was expecting. I was fighting this super big guy, because I thought that that was what you were supposed to do, but whenit came time to k-uh... deal with him, I just couldn&#39;t do it. Didn&#39;t sleep super well that night and, well, I guess that was when I got stabbed in the neck. Oh well. At least I wasn&#39;t away too long!<br><br><b>The Notary:</b> Teaming up with the clown was probably a mistake in the long run. However, I was planning to ambush Morgan when I noticed she had backup; rather than allow her to sense and subsequently try to kill me, I made a tactical withdrawal that in no way involved screaming like a little girl and waving my arms in the air. Any footage showing something to the contrary is maliciously-edited lies.<br><br><b>Wobbles the Clown:</b> Well, at least I survived, gang! I guessed you were supposed to hunt people, so I decided to team up with Ellie, but she seemed a little... too into it. So I grabbed the Time Grump and the Texan guy from the Civil War I bellyflopped on once and led them to the camp, but, well, I guess she musta seen me. I mean, I&#39;m in my TV outfit and slap so we weren&#39;t exactly inconspicuous. At least we all made it through the attack.<br><br><b>Albert Sproggins:</b> Oh, <i>Hunger</i> Games! Riiight. I think I remember Karen talking about that. Or possibly Bogbrush, I don&#39;t remember. Anyway. Turns out running and screaming at Cat 6 level - the loudest I can do and still keep up a decent pace - is pretty intimidating for anyone who doesn&#39;t know the A/V Division all that well. Bloke ended up coming back in the end, though, along with someone with a name like a drink. We wound up sleeping in shifts, keeping watch. I was worried my clock would give us all away in the night, but we turned out okay and awoke to find ourselves in the main bracket. Oh well. At least I can&#39;t come last...</p>

Seriously. I mean, I guess I did kinda forget I only got the high-speed regen half, instead of the full bundle, but Truth... And where the heck did those explosives come from, anyways? They weren&#39;t any at the Cornucopia. ... Yeah, I looked! I just decided there wasn&#39;t anything there worth fighting over! HEY! QUIT IT! <i>The camera is knocked to the floor as Apecian lunges at the person behind it, who may or may not be laughing.

We had believed that Kaatah was alone, and simply puncturing her suit would give us each a kill. We were, obviously, wrong. I am thankful the match ended when it did. There is, as one might expect, something rather unsettling about somebody preparing to gut one with one&#39;s own spear. Admittedly, I did choose that method of execution over beheading by a conjured scythe, but I had thought to make my escape as they attempted to hunt down my spear, which had been lost in the fight. I underestimated their abilities a second time. This does not bode well for the true Games. <i>Michael stands up from the chair that he, for some reason, was allowed to have. Perhaps it&#39;s because he&#39;s alive and has less reason to throw it at a stray camerawoman.</i> Speaking of the true Hunger Games, shall I proceed to meet my new District? I am sure they are all remarkably sane for members of the PPC. ... Yes, I was expecting laughter, thank you. Now, as my suspicions have been confirmed, could you explain precisely why you are laughing? ... What is a Sunflower&#39;s Witness?</p>

After reading the Board FAQ and realizing I don&#39;t have to put down an email after all, I&#39;m here!<br><br>I don&#39;t think anyone&#39;s seen me yet, but I&#39;ve been doinking around on the PPC Wiki a couple times, mostly asking questions on the Talk pages.

I&#39;m talking not just M-preg but *robot* M-preg.)<br><br>So, anyway. I&#39;ll try checking the board for a response, but if you really want to reach me quick, any PPCers who are on Scratch can go to my account as said above. Nice to meet you guys!<br><br>-Twistey</p>

            <p><b>A Somewhat Unique Circumstance</b><br><br>&quot;Hi all!<br><br>Since I probably won&#39;t be able to officially join you guys (my parents don&#39;t seem to understand that you&#39;re not actually that serious about what you do and instead see you as some sort of self-appointed fanfiction cops), I&#39;d like to create two independent characters, sort of hired fanfic mercenaries who aren&#39;t part of the PPC, but look up to you and reference you frequently (perhaps even using a few techniques they learned from the Wiki, without the equipment, of course.) Aside from the fanfic reviews they do, I&#39;m thinking of making a sort of &quot;Main Arc&quot; animated series, in which they get hired for a mission by the PPC (and maybe join up with a couple agents) to cleanse a badfic that I&#39;ll make up for the sake of the plot. Since it involves them getting hired by the PPC temporarily, but it&#39;s not exactly a PPC story, would I or wouldn&#39;t I need permission for that? I promise I&#39;ll follow the rules of PPC content if I do need permission (and hopefully if I don&#39;t, too, since a lot of those rules are no-brainers for someone as into writing and character creation as I am).<br><br>(This is the same person who asked about examples of the PPC uniform and removed an extra L from the C-brian page. Until I get a Wikia account, my Scratch username is <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/twistedwindowpane/">twistedwindowpane</a> and you can find me there. However, by the time I create the Main Arc series, I&#39;ll probably have moved on to Newgrounds, so keep an eye out for that.)<br><br>Thanks!&quot;<br><br>-Twistey</p>

            <p>And also, here&#39;s a funny question for you. One of my two &quot;hired mercenary&quot; characters tends to throw insults around a lot when angry.

            <p>Yep. It&#39;s official now. I just don&#39;t anymore.<br><br>I usually get on the Board after school at the same time as doing homework (in the words of another Scratch user, &quot;I can&#39;t be productive at all!&quot;), so I apologize for the constant nagging and... rather annoying/stupid/stalkerish behavior. It&#39;s the fourth quarter and I&#39;m still drunk on all the after-school freedom I didn&#39;t have last year... wow, me. (Or maybe it&#39;s just the ADHD and the fact that I emotionally invest myself way too much in everything I do.) Also, now that I think about it, I&#39;d been itching to put the &quot;insults&quot; question down for a while, seeing that you&#39;d be likely to come up with a lot of great stuff. You tell me on your Board tutorial that it&#39;s bad to double-post, so I just added to the thread.<br><br>Perhaps I could provide the basic info about me, though, considering that it&#39;ll give people context and would be the first thing you&#39;d ask once you&#39;ve got. I am a girl from Colorado and do a lot of writing/character creation/looking up OC guides and examples of what not to do, so I&#39;m pretty sure I know what constitutes a Mary Sue. In terms of fandoms I&#39;m a jack of almost all trades, but honestly a master of none, except for maybe those fandoms that have a small amount of canon material. To reiterate something I said to Huinesoron, I discovered the PPC through a &quot;What I Really Do&quot; meme of a Mary Sue, and was curious as to what this &quot;PPC&quot; was that it spoke of. So, now you know about me in all my painfully extroverted glory.<br><br>-Twistey</p>

            <p>...may I point you in the direction of the Das Sporking community? They are admittedly prone to swearing in a number of their sporks, but if that doesn&#39;t bother you, then I highly recommend pretty much everything they&#39;ve done. They&#39;re a community of sporkers who essentially take both bad fanfiction and bad published fiction (including things like the Twilight Saga and Fifty Shades of Grey) and actually go through it line by line and chapter by chapter (with some summarizing, of course) and take apart what it does well and what it does poorly. They also fill in research fail and use pictures, gifs, memes here and there, and even bring in fictional characters as guest sporkers (which can get hilarious). A lot of them have also written fanfic of their own, and they have an attached spitefic community (essentially, either different takes on the badfic/book scenes or an active take-down). One of the sporkers (Gehayi) is a long-time editor, and I believe a number of the others have degrees that sometimes come in handy--Ket Makura, for example, knows a lot about mythology and religions. Stuff like that. They&#39;re currently moving from LiveJournal to Dreamwidth (that is, from das-sporking.livejounal.com to das-sporking.dreamwidth.org), but that&#39;s still in progress going by what can be found at the Dreamwidth site right now. There&#39;s also a (now a bit out of date) list of main sporkings and another of shorter ones, though you can also just scroll down.<br><br>I&#39;m recommending them because I think they&#39;re good and entertaining and rather educational, and because I feel I&#39;ve learned a lot over the past, uh, I think it&#39;s a number of years of reading them, now. Das Mervin, the owner, was even involved with Deleterius when it was still around--the equivalent of an oldbie, though I don&#39;t think she&#39;s ever been a Boarder. But if you&#39;re looking to learn about writing and character design and especially what to avoid (and also what people would like to see more of--the comments are full of that!) I&#39;d definitely recommend them. So long as you don&#39;t mind some swearing, that is. It&#39;s generally not too bad, but the F-word certainly appears. (Basically, they&#39;re frequently NSFA--Not Safe For Alleb, who is a Boarder with higher standards than the Not Safe For Work tag. Your own mileage may vary.)<br><br>There are also a number of other sporks. Dan Bergstein&#39;s Twilight sporks are *hilarious*; he also did Harry Potter reviews, though I&#39;m not sure I read them. He also did the reverse-gender Twilight book on his blog, which I think is something like laserfarm.net. There&#39;s also Mark Reads (and Mark Watches, and who knows what else), though he&#39;s generally more reviews than writing tips, and the Snark Squad (snarksquad.com), who...I think also swear some? To about the same level. So also NSFA. They&#39;re less thorough than at Das Sporking, but still amusing. They do a mix of TV shows and books. (Das Sporking usually just does written stuff, but they did do the Twilight movies and I think ZeldaQueen did at least some of the A:tLA bad fancomic...um...lost track of the name, but Iximaz also missioned it.)<br><br>Anyway. Hopefully some or all of these prove both interesting and accessible to you.<br><br>And good on you for not double-posting--that&#39;s always nice. It does help to adjust your expectation of potential replies on the Board to something more like four days than two--people do have a tendency to get busy or need time to think about how to respond (often while being busy) so there really isn&#39;t always a quick response time here. That&#39;s not to say there never is, but we do frequently move somewhat slowly, especially at a time when the university crowd, at least, probably has exams.<br><br>And on a final note: I remember that meme! I remember when Lily Winterwood was making it. If you go to the talk page for the Mary Sue wiki page (I believe that&#39;s it), you can even find both the discussion and the first version of it.<br><br>Anyway, (belatedly) welcome! Have the first Swiss Bleepolate I&#39;ve given out in, uh, I don&#39;t know how long anymore. I take it you do write some fanfic, outside of the PPC-inspired-ish one you&#39;ve got planned?<br><br>~Zing</p>

I&#39;m definitely fine with the swearing - big fan of the Youtuber known as Markiplier here, and he&#39;s kinda famous for creating weird mutant exclamations out of swear words, especially when playing horror or rage games. ...There&#39;s a gender bend of Twilight?!<br><br>About the Board thing, alright.

Haha, I just read the page on her agent&#39;s Sue counterpart, Lillith (one l or two?), so I kinda know who you&#39;re talking about.<br><br>Thaaaanks for the Bleepolate, I guess? I am uneasy about eating it... I actually do mostly original stuff, and haven&#39;t written fanfic in a while, unless you count a role-play I did with an IRL friend/badfic author that I had to abandon due to a large argument we had about songfic... The most recent fanfic attempts I made were both abandoned, so the latest finished one was a terrible thing from when I was ten years old. (Yeah-huh, I got through the badfic phase <b>early</b>. I am super proud of that.) Well, given that you said that, I&#39;m going to start a new one. Powerpuff Girls fandom, centered around a group of villains I created. Wish me luck!<br><br>-Twistey</p>

            <p>Hey! I&#39;ve been looking for someone to review fanfic written by a friend of mine, and I Googled for quite some time now and still haven&#39;t found anything that would present a possibility (some say they don&#39;t review unless they liked the fic, others have no way of being contacted.) I found out that OFUs require a request from the fanfic author, and there also aren&#39;t any currently running for the fandoms I&#39;m looking for. So, as a result, I&#39;d like to find a fanfic reviewer, and your help would be good here.<br><br>I&#39;d like someone who&#39;s nice about the reviews, but doesn&#39;t give blind praise or sugarcoat beyond a few changes in wording (in the style of &quot;the character here seems a bit off&quot; rather than &quot;Obi-Wan would never do that, what the spork are you thinking!&quot;). If you personally (whoever&#39;s reading this) wish to do the review yourself, let me know and thank you, but you seriously don&#39;t have to. :) I&#39;d just like to be pointed in the direction of a fanfic reviewer. My friend&#39;s been alerted to the fact that someone&#39;s going to review her fic sometime soon, so please answer as soon as is convenient for you.<br><br>Thanks!<br><br>-Twistey</p>

            <p>I’m not sure how many Boarders actually look so far down. <br><br>Despite that, we don’t appreciate a new thread repeating a question that’s still on the first page of the board.<br><br>On the other hand, the board moves quite slowly these days. Usually, something more than three weeks old would be on the third page at best. Thus, I believe that asking again in a new thread may be acceptable. But before you jump into action, take some time to think about how to do it and why you apparently didn’t get any response on that part of your original post.<br><br>On my part, I read &quot;MissC3PO&quot; and I thought, &quot;I’m not into <i>Star Wars</i>, so that’s not for me&quot;.  (Now I looked into her profile, and I’m still not into <i>Star Wars</i> or <i>Aliens</i>, and I don’t even recognize what else might be there.)<br><br>Others may have been distracted by the discussion about what you intend to do, or the right people may not have been around at the right time, or they just didn’t care for somebody only you know.<br><br>Since not everybody takes the time to read every post, you need a title that catches attention. But you don’t want the attention of people like me, who would drop out when they realize that it’s not about one of their fandoms. Mentioning &quot;concrit&quot; and &quot;<i>Star Wars</i> fanfic&quot; in the title might help (also, explicitly asking for help).<br><br>When you have our attention, tell us why we should care. Apparently, you are in trouble, because you already told your friend that she will receive some reviews, and you will &quot;lose your face&quot; if nothing happens soon. Maybe you want to tell us this story (we obviously like to read stories): Why did you make this promise? Why do you look for reviewers here? Why do you think that a <i>concrit-&quot;allergic&quot; mediocrefic author</i> deserves our attention? Warning for robot M-preg is nice, but it may scare people away. What else is there? Why do you think that we may enjoy reading and reviewing her stories?<br><br>HG</p>

            <p>I do understand what you mean by &quot;influencing PPC canon&quot;, and I probably would have been fine with needing permission. As I said to Cat-on-the-Keyboard before I realized that I&#39;d had a severe brain fart, even though/if I don&#39;t need permission, I&#39;m still going to have some fun over here before I actually do the thing that I&#39;d need permission for. (Maybe even figure out where I could put this badfic I wrote when I was 10 so someone could spork it. Haha, it&#39;s like instead of &quot;Sign my ___!&quot; I&#39;m like &quot;Spork my fic!&quot; But anyway.)<br><br>So... This next part is directed towards everyone: has anybody checked out the author that I mentioned in my original post? Her biggest fandoms are Star Wars, Alien(s), Independence Day and Star Trek (usually a crossover of the first two.) Her lust object is C-3PO and she inserts herself quite a bit. But hopefully she&#39;ll listen to you. The main reason why I&#39;m asking you guys to critique her is because I tried and ended up turning into a writhing ball of snark (because that&#39;s just what I usually do with IRL friends and their fics). :P<br><br>Not sure what to say here... See ya sometime soon!<br>-Twistey</p>

            <p>To be specific, it&#39;s about adding to the canon, y&#39;know? So even if you <i>aren&#39;t</i> writing agents, and it&#39;s not technically a PPC story, and they&#39;re just sort&#39;ve affiliated and influenced by the PPC, it still needs permissions, y&#39;know? Influences PPC canon and whatnot. <br><br>I mean, the concept you got, in itself, certainly seems interesting - even separated from sort&#39;ve PPC stuff.

            <p>I think it&#39;s pretty clear-cut: you&#39;re going to need Permission if you want to do this.

            <p>I think Huinesoron takes precedence here, since they (she? Or is it a joint account? Need to check the page) created the universe. But either way, even though they said I don&#39;t need permission, I&#39;m still going to be hanging out here. (And clearing my browser history afterwards.)

            <p>I&#39;ve finally managed to finish a collection of GDocs with some ideas I&#39;ve had for a while for a <i>Monster Hunter</i> fangame, and I was wondering if I could get a third opinion on them, as Voyd has provided a second one. There are a <i>lot</i> of new monster concepts we&#39;ve come up with, by the way - almost 60 in all - and I still have to sketch most of them, so I&#39;d appreciate additional design ideas for them before I put them on paper. :)<br><br>If you want to check out the documents and offer feedback, please PM me on the Discord or e-mail me if you have my address!</p>
