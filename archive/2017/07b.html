            <p><a href="http://plort.wikia.com/wiki/The_History_of_Konti-Nyuum">The History of Konti-Nyuum</a> (newly revised, with thematic maps interspersed into it).<br><br><u>V. The Age of Change</u><br><br>Change, it seems, is inevitable. It began with the election of four new barons; for by the Edict of Bast, three of them took their lands in the western regions of Konti-Nyuum. In the annual baronial council of Plort, eight nobles vied for control of the increasingly crowded Borrd and Ozerbord - while in Wechi, Neshomeh alone held dominion. Of the barons of Iric, Juliette and VixenMage, who each watched over vast swathes of land, almost nothing was heard. Tensions grew ever higher.<br><br>Another invasion drove the first wedge between the patterns of past and future. The vile Green Ads, bandits and masters of stealth, swarmed across Borrd, rendering travel between its cities and towns perilous even for the best-armed among its people. All effort was made to banish them, led by two key figures: Huinesoron, who beseeched the gods Spelin Tam-Ara and Kanun Syorn for relief, and Tomash, mayor of the town Teebor, who sought to cast great wards about the whole of Plort.<br><br>The confrontation between the two was brought to a head by the arrival of the Inter&#39;Nelerors, savage flying beasts from beyond the Mistwall that swarmed across Borrd and Ozerbord alike. With their refuge shattered, the people fled to Wechi, turning in fear to the gods of distant Wechi-Ah; yet it was not gods who brought salvation. By the power of Programm&#39;an, Tomash spread his protection across the skies of Ozerbord, creating the Refuge anew. In doing so laid claim to the title of Lord Protector, ousting Baron Huinesoron from the position.<br><br>Confined to Borrd, the Inter&#39;Nelerors were swiftly dispatched, but there was another crisis to come: Ofum, long the fortress and training ground of Plort, was burned to the ground by hands unknown. The knights of Plort wavered, unable to press their attacks against the Marizu.<br><br>The Baronial Council convened in an atmosphere of despair, yet from it sprang hope anew. Forts were raised in Ozerbord and Wechi, to take up the burden of Ofum&#39;s loss. A new city was inaugrated at Critta-Kalthin, to trade with distant lands. And a new nation was created: the Riding of Sittorese between Borrd and Iric, taking the fertile lands that were once Thalia&#39;s and using them to feed the armies of Plort.<br><br>Iric did not protest the appropriation of its lands. In fact, very little news was had out of the far eastern lands, and over the months that followed the council, utter silence fell. None travelled down the untended roads between Tumblar and La Wunj; no ships sailed the sea routes between them. The land of Iric was deserted, and when Baron Huinesoron in his wanderings brought its tattered banner to Borrd, the nation was declared lost.<br><br>Over time the people drifted back, from Borrd, the Riding, and lands overseas, drawn by the lure of empty fields ripe for the taking. They had no leaders, no laws or structures of politics; discord reigned among the rivers between the mountains. But out of it something new arose, a nation of factions and divisions, unlike anything that had been seen on Konti-Nyuum.<br><br>The time was coming when the maps of Plort would be redrawn once more...<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/z20VTEA.png"><br><br>Or... welcome back, once again, to the Protectorate/Union of Plort, Konti-Nyuum! This is the answer to the question &#39;what if the PPC community was actually a medieval kingdom&#39;, and it&#39;s been providing us with fun and bemusement for a few years now. You - yes, you! - are a citizen of the Union - a knight, a civilian, or a baron. There is a handy <a href="http://plort.wikia.com/wiki/Beginner%27s_Guide_to_Plort">Beginner&#39;s Guide</a> to get you oriented, and a whole wiki attached to it.<br><br>This is the thread for you to tell us your story, whether you&#39;re new to Plort or just need to update it. Transform your history into Plort-speak (the <a href="http://plort.wikia.com/wiki/Glossary">Glossary is helpful here) and write it up, and we&#39;ll put it on the Cyclopaedia/wiki for you. </a><a href="http://plort.wikia.com/wiki/Huinesoron">Mine looks like this</a>, for instance, and you can hunt down any other Boarder&#39;s that you&#39;re interested in. (Be aware that the map above is as of the Fall of Iric. It hasn&#39;t been updated to reflect new developments... it will be.)<br><br>This is also the thread for heraldry! The original purpose of Plort was to give me an excuse to draw heraldic shields for people, and that certainly hasn&#39;t changed. The College of Arms at Castle Maklaur uses two styles of heraldry: Inglish and Alvish. <a href="http://plort.wikia.com/wiki/Heraldry">There&#39;s a guide to those, too</a>. If you can describe your shield(s), either in formal heraldic speak or just in words, I&#39;ll be delighted to create it for you. (And if you want to put together a description of a Marizu warlord you&#39;ve fought, and create heraldry for them, that&#39;s fine too! There&#39;s even a section on it, and <a href="http://plort.wikia.com/wiki/Category:Marizu_Heraldry">a few that already exist</a>.<br><br>Finally, this is the thread for the Council of Plort to take place. This is an in-universe RP to which everyone is invited, though only Barons (currently) have voting rights. It&#39;s where we both play around with fictional politics, and try to update the setting to match the current state of the community. I&#39;ll be making a sub-thread for the Council shortly. It&#39;s... going to be a busy one. (This is where we&#39;ll be updating the map. Hooooo boy.)<br><br>Last thing, I swear - Plort is for fun. Plort is not for attacking people. I hope I don&#39;t have to say that.<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/qMqrD5E.png"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/bYp9BuE.png"><br><br>Huinesoron, by the Grace of Kanun Baron of Plort, <s>Protector of Ozerbord</s>, Warden of the Fanvik-Whirl, Master of Kwenaya, Friend of Medellurth, &amp;c &amp;c</p>

            <p>Twistey&#39;s inclusion of Staar-Wos in her tale led me to place both it and Staar-Tric on the map of Weab. Then I realised that not only was Staar-Tric the source of the Marizu in the first place, but that both nations could be said to be in the same state as the Potterverse: let down by their creators, and thus defected entirely to the Marizu League.<br><br>(I mean, I quite like <i>Voyager</i>, but it and <i>Enterprise</i> are fairly consistently regarded as bad. And the <i>Star Wars</i> prequels certainly count, if <i>The Cursed Child</i> does.)<br><br>So I wanted to write their story, or maybe the full story of the Marizu League. But as I began, I realised that there was more to the story: I couldn&#39;t write the history of the Marizu without creating the history of the Empire it spawned from.<br><br>So... I did. :D<br><br><a href="http://plort.wikia.com/wiki/The_Rise_and_Fall_of_the_Scholars%27_Empire">The Rise and Fall of the Scholars&#39; Empire</a><br><br>AKA hS has great fun working out what the late 19th-century equivalents for chunks of the internet are.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Memory serving, the Scholars&#39; Empire was on a continent to the north of Plort, with Plort being somewhat in between the Scholars&#39; Empire and Weab. So I take it that this is a retcon? <br><br>I&#39;m not saying that it would be [i]bad[/i], per se, if this is inded the case--actually, it works quite well that that Marizu and the Scholars&#39; Empire are on the same continent, vying for supremacy.

            <p>I don’t actually know what it should look like, but I feel that the flag should somehow represent the conflict of &quot;imagination&quot; versus &quot;sticking to the rules (of kanun and spelin)&quot;. I would like to use octarine to represent imagination, but obviously we cannot draw that.

            <p>It&#39;s established that the Riding uses the <a href="http://plort.wikia.com/wiki/Acacia">Arrow of Acacia</a> as its symbol; we (because apparently no-one opposes Baron Huinesoron claiming baronial lands in the Riding) could use that to divide the flag in two, with one half octarine, the other half... well, grey is a traditional Plortish colour, and would represent the Grey Lady, who lived in the Twin Temples.

            <p>Business was good today, but nothing of any real importance happened in her life specifically. Just daydreaming about becoming a knight. Wiping sweat from her forehead, she sits down behind the counter to think about where she&#39;s been...<br><br><i>Twyla Witherspoon was not always worthy of residence in the Protectorate of Plort, as she had only just recently started caring about the Marizu and their deeds. Her voyage to Konti-Nyuum started early; at age eleven she unknowingly founded a small band of Marizu in the country of Staar-Wos. She also caused the existence of monstrosities in Mayen Croft (a large and mainly Marizu area of Vidya Gaym) and the Airi-junal Islands. Only one or two years ago, she very nearly avoided the generation of more Marizu in Tiu Fort (also in Vidya Gaym) and Sti Venkeen. None of these things affect Twyla&#39;s conscience, and what little of it finished the journey to Weab was kept in the small but wild nation of Sk&#39;ratsh. Indeed, she cannot wait to announce her knowledge to her fellow citizens of Borrd and thus open them to attack!<br><br>Twyla discovered Plort, specifically Wechi, through absentmindedly attempting to divine images of the Marizu in a bowl of Guugol fluid. Curious, she set off for Wechi, and immediately knew that Plort was where she wanted to stay. Upon her entry in Borrd, she caused a bit of commotion in front of Baron Huinesoron himself due to her misreading a book of Plort&#39;s history. She is still rather embarrassed about the incident, but has come to reside in Borrd rather nicely.<br><br>Currently, Twyla is a shopkeeper who sells artwork, weapons, travel guides for several Airi-junal Islands, and souvenirs from the District of Eidsaf&#39;twaer in Vidya Gaym, which she visits a lot, especially a castle called Wolfreidi. She is currently in the process of creating a set of weapons and tactical gear for herself, relentlessly improving her combat skills so that one day she can try and apply for knighthood.</i><br><br>-----<br><br>So, here&#39;s a few things I&#39;d like to ask for help with on the backstory:<br>1. Are the new names I had to come up with okay? In case you need clarification, Staar-Wos is Star Wars, Mayen Croft is Minecraft, Tiu Fort is Team Fortress 2, Sti Venkeen is the Stephen King fandom, Sk&#39;ratsh is Scratch.mit.edu (not sure if it should be a part of Weab or So Shall Media, since some folks use it as a substitute for FF.net, but most users think of it as a second DeviantArt), Guugol fluid is Google (the search engine and no other part of it), Eidsaf&#39;twaer is the iD Software fandom, and Wolfreidi is the Wolfenstein 3D (Wolf 3D) fandom. Did I do a good job of naming these things?<br>2. I said above that Twyla caused the existence of various Marizu, but that sounds a bit off. Is there any other way to say the equivalent of &quot;I actually wrote a bunch of bad fanfic when I was younger?&quot;<br>3. I also said that Twyla sells guides to some Airi-junal islands, but that also seems a bit off. Is there any other way to say the equivalent of &quot;I write a lot of original fic?&quot;<br>4. I probably also got a few things about the Plortverse wrong. I was going to do more research and fix them, but I don&#39;t have time to do so right now, so I&#39;m going to post this and let you guys tell me what I did.<br>5. Give me any other tips you have! Tips are greatly appreciated! :D<br><br>-Twistey/Twyla Witherspoon, owner of Twyla&#39;s Odds and Ends</p>

            <p>I have no problem with any of the names. I think it would be good to use the existence of Guggle in your &#39;Guugol fluid&#39; (Guggle fluid?), since, y&#39;know, consistency.<br><br>Sk&#39;ratsh probably isn&#39;t part of the SSM; the Grand Republic of Deeay isn&#39;t, and that&#39;s what you compared it to. :) It may be ripe for conquest by them, though.<br><br>I think the best way to handle the badfic thing would be to accidentally inspire a Marizu warband (or multiple). You can probably straight-up create monsters in Mayen Croft - it&#39;s Vidya Gaym, they have all kinds of strange magics there. But unless you want to directly lead the Marizu into battle (misguidedly, of course), being an unintentional inspiration is probably best.<br><br>I like the idea of the guides! The alternative is building yourself a pocket nation there, but that may be excessive for a simple shopkeeper. Uppa&#39;you.<br><br>I don&#39;t think there&#39;s any issues with the setting. Plort is deliberately a fairly loose creation, to allow for people to easily add to it. (And, for the record, I vaaaaguely remember you doing something, but don&#39;t remember what; don&#39;t let it worry you.)<br><br>Can I craft you some heraldry? Any citizen of Plort is entitled to it. If you don&#39;t feel up to designing a shield, name some symbols you might want and I can work from there.<br><br>hS</p>

<li>Alrighty, that helps. Guggle fluid, haha.<br><br>2. Probably is part of them already. I mean, all the famous Scratchers have DA accounts, came from DA, treat Scratch like it&#39;s DA (hence why there&#39;s constant fighting about recolors, which are allowed on Scratch but aren&#39;t on DA), and all that.<br><br>3. That&#39;d probably work. By &quot;monstrosities&quot;, though, I meant weird and/or Suvian characters, including a Sued version of a friend and a Wither boss with Emperor Palpatine&#39;s face. (Eeeww.) I guess the unintentional inspiration shall be what it is for the rest of them. But what about the whole &quot;didn&#39;t make it to Weab&quot; part? Does that work? I mean, none of my badfic ever got posted online, and even now I don&#39;t have an account on Wattpad, Quotev, FF.net or any of that.<br><br>4. Yay, I had a good idea! Woooo! Maybe I can also add that Twyla has found a love interest in a citizen of one of the islands, just to add more. (Yeah, I&#39;ve declared one of my OCs my boyfriend, since I don&#39;t feel ready to have a real one yet. But I&#39;m making sure not to give him excessive nice things, like other authors are wont to do. In fact, emotional struggle is a huge part of him as a character. But enough about that for now.)<br><br>5. Alrighty, I guess that worked, then! (All I remember doing is commenting on stuff, one of the comments being a question of who Xing is.)<br><br>6. Perhaps something done in gold on a dark green background, since heraldry remains static against a person&#39;s life and therefore I can&#39;t be all Wolfensteiny and I&#39;ve got to look at my less edgy self-inserts for inspiration. (;P) Probably a tree of some sort, with butterflies to the left and right and crossed branches/leaves underneath. I guess. Nature was my thing back in my purest days that I can remember, so try to work with that. <br><br>6b. However, there is the other idea that Twyla gained heraldry upon her entry to Plort and didn&#39;t have it before, in which case, you can make it all Wolfensteiny and impressive. Maybe even a wolf&#39;s face itself, and weapons of some kind somehow involved. Black and red (you can choose the background color between the two), maybe some shiny blueish like all the doors in Wolf 3D are. I can give you some color references if needed.<br><br>6c. I&#39;m overthinking this, aren&#39;t I.<br><br>-Twistey</li>

            <p>So many folks who create content involving that stuff, it&#39;s almost like he never died. I&#39;ve been to really weird parts of the Internet, and even outside of it, it is almost like he is a god. Either I&#39;m overestimating it, or you&#39;re underestimating the number of weird and/or messed-up people that exist on the Internet.<br><br>The multiplicity was kind of similar to how in the regular PPC, a character replacement is a different being than the canon. Wait, hang on, that doesn&#39;t match my thing entirely. Let&#39;s make a compromise of having it it more similar to what I&#39;m actually comparing it to, and make it so that the particularly OOC depictions become separate characters, like impostors trying to use his infamy to get people to do stuff. I&#39;m kind of starting to see your point here. But what do I know, I&#39;m just a culturally insensitive, privileged, emotionally unstable piece of ADHD trash, and that is my honest opinion of myself. You can do whatever you want.<br><br>Wolfreidi is obviously Wolfenstein 3D, so logic follows that Castwolf is Castle Wolfenstein (a castle that Eidsaf&#39;twaer acquired through claiming it after it was abandoned), New Wolfreidi is Return to Castle Wolfenstein, Wolftino is Wolfenstein: The New Order/The Old Blood (but it&#39;s a city), etc. If you&#39;ve got time to also add in the other points of interest in the District, there do exist the fortresses of Du&#39;um and New Du&#39;um (Doom and its 2016 reboot), a city called Komankin (Commander Keen series) and Kwaik and Raij, which I am unsure what to make.<br><br>This hasn&#39;t calmed down yet. I saw Bramandin&#39;s huge thread before she was banned, and am now reading the page on the Wiki about her PPC career as TooPurple and zdimensia as well, and I saw a little of myself in a couple (thankfully not all) of her perspectives. Didn&#39;t feel that they were right, but felt that it could happen to me as well. Give me some reasons why I&#39;m not going to be banned eventually.<br><br>-Twistey</p>

            <p>If you&#39;re reading Bram&#39;s account of herself on her user page, do be aware that that is the story from the perspective of someone with an undiagnosed mental illness whose take on reality is often rather different from everyone else&#39;s. Everyone&#39;s entitled to their opinions, but that doesn&#39;t make them the whole truth. If you want to know what really happened, I suggest that you look back at <a href="https://technodann.github.io/PPC-board-2.0/archive/index.html">the archives</a> and see what everyone actually said at the time, in context.<br><br>As for the whole Hitler thing... have you tried <i>not</i> hanging out in places obsessed with Hitler?

IIRC, at least in the beginning, it was all incidental: nobody went out of their way to build up a specific fandom or Internet thing beyond how it related to their journey to the PPC—because Plort is about the PPC. Weab may be a representation of the Internet, but it&#39;s <i>our</i> representation of the Internet, through a very specific lens, and I keep thinking of a quote from LotR: &quot;There is in [Lothlórien] no evil, unless a man brings it hither himself.&quot;<br><br>So... don&#39;t. {= )<br><br>It&#39;s actually pretty difficult to get yourself banned around here.

<li>Actually, on her user page, somebody wrote down a history of Bram&#39;s activity that seems to definitely not have been written from her perspective.<br><br>2. Believe me, it&#39;s not really a matter of &quot;hanging out&quot; there, I just often stumble into weird stuff while searching on Google Images, and it&#39;s so bad that the memories stick with me.

But as for the rest of it, it&#39;s mainly just a matter of, well, I&#39;ve also always had a bit of a thing for trying to know everything about a subject before forming opinions, and then trying to be as honest and factual about it as possible. Perhaps it&#39;s because I live in an age of extreme opinions and constant battles over political correctness in the media, or perhaps it&#39;s because I&#39;m trying to get control over my emotions and stop freaking out over everything. Either way, it&#39;s becoming obvious to me that I have a slight obsession with research and kind of idealize a lack of bias that probably isn&#39;t humanly attainable. Or something. Probably just trying to convince myself that my problem is something other than what it actually is. Which is- oh never mind. This paragraph is getting too long and train-of-thought-y. Let&#39;s just say I bring evil wherever I go. Hah ;P<br><br>4. The question is, though, if your patience truly is long enough for you to eventually see me fixed.

<li>Nope, the only editor of her userpage has been her. I just checked the edit history.<br><br>2. Randomly stumbling across images seems a flimsy basis for declaring that Hitler is god-worshiped by some corners of the Internet, IMO. It only takes a few trolls to make disturbing images; it takes a group to form a culture, and it takes observing said group for a period of time to correctly observe its culture. Either you&#39;re overgeneralizing your observations or you&#39;re understating your involvement. In either case, see 3. (And, good! Someone has to be a responsible adult around here.)<br><br>2b. Nope, I said &quot;stuff&quot; for a reason. You&#39;re fine; Hitler-cultishness is not.<br><br>3. Yes, leaving things out is okay. You can in fact choose what you allow to shape your subjective experience of the Internet. We&#39;re all living in weird times, and fact-checking is good, but there&#39;s such a thing as delving too deep in the rabbit hole. There&#39;s also such a thing as over-sharing.<br><br>4. &quot;Fixed&quot; is not an attainable goal. &quot;Better,&quot; on the other hand, is a choice we all have the chance to make every day. You seem to have some awareness of your issues, which is a good first step. Use that awareness to make better choices next time, and the time after that, and so forth. Also, this may or may not relate to you, but I&#39;ll put it out there anyway: if you need professional and/or chemical assistance to make better choices, that&#39;s okay! Lots of us do.

            <p>In fact, I should have waited before making the Plort Wiki edits in the first place! Heh.<br><br>1. Ah... that&#39;s interesting. Anything else I might want to look at about this person?<br><br>2. Eh, well, less like god worshiping and more like just an obsession. But it can seem that way if one keeps running into it when trying to search up seemingly unrelated subjects. (Wait, I think I remember encountering an article on this...) Either that or I was kinda high-fantasy-ifying the thing. I do not clearly recall my motives at the time, aside from the fact that the &quot;multiple versions same mind&quot; thing probably stemmed from my personal portrayal of the guy in my depictions of the fandom multiverse (e.g. there&#39;s the ghost of the real guy, then there&#39;s sort of a shared entity for all the WWII historical fiction that he is not directly involved in, then all the different other depictions in the weird historical fiction that he is directly involved in, and then there&#39;s the OOC ones which are too OOC to actually be the same entity). Which in turn stemmed from the abilities and forms of a substitute character I created a while ago, which stemmed from a (now ditched) series of games that stemmed from my own personal strife. But anyway, back on topic. (And <i>nyah!</i> }:P)<br><br>2b. Stuff is a weird word... *gets increasingly confused about why the word stuff even exists* Oh, whoops. Back on topic.<br><br>3. Rabbit hole, eh? We&#39;re all mad here! ;P<br><br>4. The next step for me is probably convincing myself that I&#39;m not doomed to failure.

            <p>...the similarities are fewer than I thought. Seems like Bram didn&#39;t know enough, whereas I know far too much, about this subject. And there&#39;s also the fact that the Permission requirements have become better worded since that time, which resolves the recognition of Bram&#39;s back-and-forth about doing the wrong thing with Permission attempts. Whew. No I&#39;m not Bramandin, zdimensia or Toopurple, on my word as a PPCer. If I were, I would not have had to read the profile page to resolve lacks of understanding, am I right? (Wow, this has escalated pretty quickly.)<br><br>There does, however, still stand the vague shared trait of, how to word it, frequently jumping to the worst conclusions. (Not to mention I&#39;m also kind of afraid of being discriminatory!) But I do realize that these are my faults and not those of the PPC, and that I will, over time, eventually get better at maintaining a state of balance. I apologize for making too many moves at once with regards to... everything, it seems. That often happens when I discover something new. Probably won&#39;t get banned after all, may I have your forgiveness?<br><br>-Twistey</p>

            <p>The first three parts are already on the <a href="http://plort.wikia.com/wiki/Hieronymus">Plort wiki </a>, but to give newbies an impression of how this is supposed to work, I post them here again, with annotations that are not meant to be part of the chronicle. Also, I’m going to correct mistakes and insert missing links in part three. <br><br>((Part One, published 2014))<br><br>Not much is known about Hieronymus the hermit. He travelled wide and far, looking for a place where to dwell when his livelong journey came near its end. Following rumours about a dreaded plague called the Marizu, and the brave knights who fought this evil, he came to the shores of Wechi. Unseen by anybody, he roamed this vast land for over a year, even sneaking into Arkive and the Hall of Ancient Records. Only when a stranger accused the noble knights of vile malefaction, Hieronymus stepped forward to Borrd to defend their selfless deeds. ((Looking for something to do when I’m retired from my job, reading everything on &quot;The Complete List of PPC Fiction&quot;, lurking and then joining a discussion about what the PPC actually do.)) <br><br>Since then, he has talked to some of the denizens of Plort, and he began to build his home in Wechi, and to prepare his offerings to Kanun and Spelin, for he pondered to explore the mountain range of Purmeshun, but now he seems to be lost in the wood of Kar’eer. How he got there is still a mystery, for he has never been seen in Iric. ((Talking on the board while never chatting in the IRC, creating a wiki user page and thinking about prospective agents and how to get Permission, but not actually doing much, because my job got into the way.)) <br><br>Some may conclude that Hieronymus is a fearsome mage who comes and goes of his own volition, and has not revealed his full power yet, while others may believe that he is a leaf in the wind, never knowing where he may be tomorrow, and both may be right, for being self-contradictory is his very nature.<br><br>((Part Two, published 2015))<br><br>Over time, rumours spread that the hermit may have left the dark woods to walk the roads and pathways of Plort again.<br><br>Inhabitants of Ozerbord remember a grey bearded man who appeared at the Games of Batveg, clad in the habit of a harlequin, pretending to be a veritable knight, but fighting the atrocities in other knight’s tales rather than the misdeeds of the Marizu. Of course this fool was laughed out of town. ((Introducing the &quot;Uncanonical Department of Inaccuracies&quot; in the badfic games.))<br><br>Wordsmiths and Grammagicians at Worhkshap tell tales of a taciturn, grey bearded man wielding a staff – named Androia – in the training sessions for scribe apprentices. Civilians, knights and even barons up and down Plort claim that this very man’s feeble attempts in practising the ancient arts of Beytah may actually have improved their strength.  And nobody shall ever again mention the Quiet Baker-Knight’s weird experience at the Shipfest in a nameless harbour. ((Developing prospective agents Androia and Hieronymus in writing exercises for Poor Cynic’s workshops, beta reading for various PPCers, being shipped in the shipfic fest for &quot;German Pretzels&quot;.))<br><br>It is also said that Hieronymus, on his flight from Ozerbord to Worhkshap, passed an unexplored region at the junction of the Wattuf Mountains and the Mountains of Reverence, where he found the Snow Drops, a moste potente potion that helps curing forgetfulness. How these will be used in the future is yet to be seen. ((Occasionally role-playing an uncanonical Flower – the Snowdrop, Inofficial Department Head of the Uncanonical Department of Inaccuracies – on the board.))<br><br>Recently, the peasants living in the lands between the rivers Wep and Freewep began to talk about a newcomer, fitting the hermit’s description, amongst the workers sent by Baron Neshomeh to help in repairing the damage caused by the last earthquakes. ((Webs.com and freewebs.com continuously delete former PPCers sites for inactivity.))<br><br>The peasants are probably not mistaken, for one day not far in the past, Hieronymus appeared in the Hall of Ancient Records – as he likes to appear out of the blue – and he bent low, and he spoke up and said, ‘Milady Neshomeh, I travelled wide and far. My eyes are old, and my posterior can not stand perpetually riding against the Marizu. But my mind is still sharp, and my hands don’t tremble. If you would assign me a corner in your castle Arkive, where I can rest and store my staff and flask, I could help you copying and restoring these documents I see are in bad shape and may soon disaggregate into dust. And in case I feel ever fit to follow you into battle, I would appreciate the licence to wear your colour on my shield.’<br><br>((Offering to help Neshomeh with archiving &quot;The Lost Tales&quot;, and asking permission to use Neshomeh’s special shade of green on my coat of arms. Also, Hieronymus the hermit asking for a corner to store his still uncanonical &quot;weapons&quot; implies that Hieronymus the boarder, if he ever asks for and gets permission, would like to have Hieronymus the archivist’s apprentice store his stories in the archive of Lost Tales, skipping the step of having them gone lost elsewhere first.))<br><br>((Part Three, published 2016))<br><br>The humble hermits request was met with grace. But rather than finding the rest he had hoped for in that tiny corner at Arkive, the archivist’s new apprentice was immediately sent off to demonstrate and improve his Eich-Tee-Ehm-Ehl skills in the devastated lands. ((Actually working on &quot;The Lost Tales&quot; and the wiki.))<br><br>While Hieronymus was supposed to travel between Arkive and the river Freewep, he somehow became sidetracked to the City of Borrd. He arrived just in time for the annually <a href="http://plort.wikia.com/wiki/2015_Baronial_Council">Baronial Council</a>, where he barely escaped imprisonment and prosecution for treason and libel by Baron Thanasius Ampelius. Had he not conveniently gone lost in the wood of Kar’eer again, Hieronymus would certainly have talked his head off. ((Getting into a dispute about who should govern the new nation &quot;Riding of Sittorese&quot; and chickening out of the role play. Also, my job getting into the way becomes a recurring theme.))<br><br>On his flight from the baron’s ire, the hermit fell into a dubious dungeon. But that is another story and shall be told on another day – actually <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MQ1nC9VEKEzg4FyrZoHUQYYb_R7Iev1DKDwzhjAA3xw/pub"> here</a>, based on <a href="http://huinesoron.webs.com/PPC/BoardDungeon.htm">this</a>,  – but Hieronymus did still not reveal how he got out of this mess again.<br><br>The way through the dungeon may have led to an alternate universe, for Hieronymus clearly remembers that he got out of the forest by following Baron Dann from Castle Tegnoh to La Wunj, where he attended a great festival, apparently held annually to celebrate a victory over the ypurs. His memories of spotting Dame Karrin the Blue and Baron Thanasius Ampelius, and making an awkward attempt to apologize, are much less clear. Before he could hear a response, Hieronymus fell to the floor, very drunken, rolled under a table, started to snore and never spoke another word in Iric. <br><br>((The festival was proposed by the baron formerly known as Techno-Dann on the Baronial Council. I had so hoped for an opportunity to finally put one line into the IRC and give closure to the role-play I had chickened out of, while having an excuse to ignore all further discussion. Alas, it was not meant to be.))<br><br>When he woke up again, all the Ops and Dars of Iric were gone, La Wunj lay mostly abandoned, none of the few citizens Hieronymus still found remembered any recent festivities, and when he asked for Baron Dann, glares and stares were the only answers the hermit got, for everybody knows that south-eastern Plort is and always was ruled by the fair Baroness Delta Juliette. Thus, Hieronymus joined the last trek that left La Wunj to the west, and since he became more invested in the Riding of Sittorese, he travelled on until he reached the Empire of Fanvik-Neht, where he built a <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/u/7551074/">secret hermitage</a> which he hopes will once become a stronghold of goodriding. ((Acknowledging Delta Juliette’s story and the abandoning of the IRC; creating an account on fanfic.net and starting to write &quot;Air&#39;ihpotre&quot; fanfiction that didn’t get much attention yet.))<br><br>How he got across the ocean and then back again, is still one of many mysteries, but although he was supposed to be back on his job of dusting off old scrolls in Arkive, some strange fate took the archivist’s apprentice to the newly assembled Baronial Council again, where he was promptly and retroactively tasked with keeping the records. ((Assuming responsibility for the chronicles of the Baronial Councils.))<br><br>((Part Four, published 2017))<br><br>On his way home from the City of Borrd, Hieronymus the hermit got no further than the Lhawgin Heights, for one evening, when he sat at his campfire [...] strange noise [... ho]oded figure spoke, approaching the old man, [... some(?)] of the Barons talked among us, and [...] agree [...] your journeys through the nations of [...] works in the archives [...] gain [...]understanding of the ways and mores of Pl[ort, ...] dedication to the Riding of Sittorese and the Law of Goodriding. Thus [...] join the ranks of our armies, riding against the Marizu [...]  <br><br>[...] addressed like this, the archivist’s apprentice was so fl[ustered(?) ...] forgot that he had not made proper offers at the temples of Kanun an[d Spelin ...] never wandered the Knights’ Road, and he fell to his knees, and he felt a sword touch his should[er(?) ...] became a knight of Plort without much of the pomp and cere[mony(?) ...us]ually involved.    <br><br>[Archivist’s note: The end of the scroll looks like it was ripped by talons and singed by flames. As far as can be determined from other sources, Hieronymus the hermit did not return to Arkive before the next Baronial Council was held, but he may have shown up when Baron Iximaz gathered an Army for a campaign to the Bronee.]  <br><br>((Getting Permission, participating in a Role Play that became part of Iximaz’s <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qsE0Hvs6D1solpkkIrRzvQRUGLaqB8nB5T5x3Zv0NsY/edit">&quot;Neverfree From Working&quot;</a>)).<br><br>((I don’t know yet whether there will be another scroll. Keeping the tune is hard, I obviously didn’t do much worth mentioning since I got Permission, and there is not much left that would be mentionable just for me doing it for the first time. So, this may be a good point to let this tale end.))<br><br>HG</p>

            <p>The doors of Otik creak open. As the rail lashes at the flagstones, Baron Huinesoron walks slowly into the council chamber. He walks with a cane, one leg trailing limply behind him, but his back is straight and his head held high.<br><br>He does not look at the gathered barons, knights, and civilians. He crosses the wide floor in silence, coming at last to a stop in front of the grand map of Plort carved into the wall. From his pocket he draws a stylus, pulsing with red light.<br><br>&quot;We&#39;ve been through some troubling times lately,&quot; he says. A ripple runs through the crowd as they hear the cracking in his voice, the strain weighing on every syllable, but the baron does not look round. He raises the stylus, and its lambent glow cuts into the stonework like clay.<br><br>&quot;The war…&quot; Huinesoron shakes his head. &quot;Was it even a war?&quot; His hand moves over the Forest of Kar&#39;eer, dust falling as the rain where it passes. &quot;The Mords of the discord say their lands are bountiful and cultured. They say the western lands pleaded to join with them, to live under their enlightened rule.&quot; He walks down the length of the map, his cane tapping on the stone, and presses his palm over the city Ozerbord. &quot;They say that when their airships landed at Skypcht, they were welcomed with open arms.<br><br>&quot;I have my doubts.&quot; The stylus sweeps across the Geymez Plateau, obliterating the name of Ozerbord, and inscribing a new one in its place. &quot;But I will not fight. Geymez, as La Wunj, belongs to the discord.&quot;<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/vaP18r4.png"><br><br>He steps back and looks up, his gaze taking in the northern Spalchik Lowlands, where the city of Teebor and the castle Kwenaya gleam as twin jewels. &quot;The Refuge stands empty,&quot; he says. &quot;Oh, it draws the crowds from time to time, when peril strikes or the old festivals resume, but none live there.&quot; He stretches up and plucks the green gem of Kwenaya from the map. &quot;It has no need of a baron,&quot; he says softly.<br><br>The stylus flickers to life anew, its light shading to a deep blue. &quot;I relinquish the barony of what was once Ozerbord,&quot; Huinesoron says, tracing glowing lines across the map. &quot;Let what remains of the Refuge stand without the baron it no longer needs, and let the Lady Iximaz take up her place as warden of the new discord in the west. By the Edict of Bast, those lands once held by Baron Thanasius Ampelius also pass to her; the lands beyond the mountains are united once more.&quot;<br><br>He steps back. The whole chamber seems to hold its breath as he studies the map, and then he makes his slow, steady way down to the line of the Larninkurvs.<br><br>&quot;Barony July,&quot; he says, and a sigh drifts through the air. &quot;Barony Ampelius. Barony Cassie. Barony Araeph.&quot; The baron lifts his stylus again, and green fire gathers about its tip. &quot;All stand empty, in the heart of Borrd and the Riding. This cannot be.&quot;<br><br>Under his pen a new pattern of baronies takes shape. &quot;I will take Barony Araeph as my own,&quot; Huinesoron says, plucking the amber jewel of Araeph&#39;s castle and pressing his own garnet into its place. &quot;I will reclaim Retben from its ruins and build a new keep in its place. And I will take also Barony July, ceding back its southern tip to Barons Neshomeh and Juliette.<br><br>&quot;But,&quot; and with a sudden stroke he inscribes a circle around the city of Borrd itself, &quot;I will not claim baronial authority over this city. I ask that the Council of Borrd be jointly trusted with that duty, as has been proposed on many previous occasions.&quot;<br><br>He pauses for a moment, bowing his head. Then he reaches up and carves a new hole into the map, on the banks of the river Meibot. &quot;We have welcomed Baron Eshakhar into our midst,&quot; he says, pulling a carved rose quartz from his pocket and clicking it into place. &quot;Let Baronies Ampelius and Cassie be hers to watch and to ward, to lead into battle and to lead in time of peace.&quot;<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/afzZ4wg.png"><br><br>Baron Huinesoron turns at last, facing the Council. His face is pale and drawn as he looks out at them, and in his outstretched hand he holds the four gemstones he has plucked from the map: amber for Araeph, topaz for Thanasius Ampelius, turquoise for July, and jasper for Cassie.<br><br>&quot;We&#39;ve been through some troubling times lately,&quot; he says again. &quot;This island fortress has-&quot; He pauses, wincing, and leans heavily on his cane before speaking again. &quot;Has been shaken. But it has not fallen.&quot;<br><br>Huinesoron straightens up again, and a fiery spark seems to burn in his eyes. &quot;And it will not fall,&quot; he declares. &quot;Not while any one of us draws breath. This is the Union of Plort - the legacy of Jay and Acacia - and it. Will. Not. Fall.<br><br>&quot;We must draw together, now more than ever. To that end-&quot; He stops again, draws a deep breath. &quot;To that end, I propose that this Baronial Council be expanded to include not only our military leaders, but also those who guide the fo- <i>five</i> nations of Konti-Nyuum.&quot; He looks across the crowd, noting faces and absences. &quot;Let the archivists of Wechi send their representatives, and the Beytahs of the Riding. Let,&quot; a wince crosses his face, &quot;Protector Tomash of Ozerbord sit in council, and…&quot; The baron closes his eyes, clutching the gemstones in an involuntary fist. &quot;And let the Mords of the discord be seated among us, that together we may debate and decide what is best for the Union of Plort.&quot;<br><br><hr>
<br><br>The national borders and the shut-down baronies aren&#39;t really open for dispute. The Discord has taken over most of the RPing that used to be done on T-Board, so it gets the land to go with it. The relocation of Barony Huinesoron, boundaries of Barony Eshakhar, expansions of baronies Iximaz, Neshomeh, and Juliette, status of Borrd, and the expansion of the Council of Plort (<i>not</i> the Council of Borrd, which remains just barons - Iximaz, Phobos, PC, Huinesoron, Kaitlyn, and Eshakhar by the above maps), are all up for debate.<br><br>Oh, and in keeping with the theme established a while back, the colour of baronies on the map/the gemstones used for their castles is what you get if you plug their names into &lt;font color=&quot;this spot&quot;&gt;. Since &#39;Zingenmir&#39; is identical to &#39;Huinesoron&#39;, you get Eshakhar.<br><br>Iximaz - Sapphire<br>Phobos - Obsidian<br>PoorCynic - Jade<br>Neshomeh - Lapiz Lazuli<br>Huinesoron - Garnet<br>Kaitlyn - Ruby<br>Eshakhar - Rose Quartz<br>Juliette - Amythest<br>VixenMage - Turquoise<br><br>And someone please give the Discord a proper name! Baron Me has been using the descriptive word &#39;discord&#39;, but I doubt you want to just stick with that. (If you feel like making a flag for it - or if anyone wants to throw in a flag for the Riding of Sittorese - that would be delightful.)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>The discussion on the first subject of the agenda is closed.<br><br>By votes of four to zero, Protector Tomash of Ozerbord and the Mords of the Diskord were invited to join the barons in the Council of Plort. <br><br>Since there is a tie between two pro-votes and two contra-votes, no decision could be made concerning the representation of the Riding of Sittorese by its Beytahs.<br><br>Although three barons support the idea of having some sort of representation of the Commonwealth of Wechi that would be independent of the resident baron, and only one baron spoke against it, the barons’ actual intentions were left unclear. By not objecting to Sir Hieronymus speaking for all denizens of Wechi, Baron Neshomeh – who obviously is a denizen of Wechi – may have changed her mind from &quot;invite the archivists&quot; (apparently intending to give one vote to each archivist) to &quot;let all denizens of Wechi have one collective vote&quot;. Either way, she would not be in agreement with Baron Huinesoron, who specified that &quot;the archivists&quot; should get one collective vote. Sar Iximaz’s &quot;no objections to adding more voices to the council&quot; is factually an abstain, since it might support whatever form of expanding the council the other barons decide to fit best, but there is no favored position. Thus, no actual decision could be made.<br> <br>Protector Tomash and the attendant Mords of the Confederation of Diskord are asked to voice their opinions on the other subjects of the agenda now, so that votes can be counted and decisions can be made.<br><br>((Sorry about that, hS. Since I can’t tweak it to invite the Beytahs, I don’t want to tweak it to invite the archivists. Maybe we can try again next year.<br><br>The rest of the agenda is still open for discussion. Especially the matter of the border between baronies Huinesoron and Neshomeh may need some outsider input in favor of one position or another. Personally, I think that Neshomeh and Huinesoron are both great Riders of Sittorese and neither of them should be held off the Riding, but I don’t feel like a knight of Wechi and archivist’s apprentice should be the person who pushes Baron Neshomeh in this direction. He has already been rebellious enough for one council.<br><br>HG)) </p>

            <p>Baron Huinesoron nodded in turn to Oopart, Baron PC, the Djenni, Sar Iximaz&#39;s projection, and - reluctantly - Protector Tomash. &quot;I know it can be hard to tear ourselves away and travel to Borrd, so while I am, as you, but a member of this Council, I am grateful that you have made the time.<br><br>&quot;To the work, then. If Sar Iximaz does not see fit to watch over the lands of the western Diskord, I have no objection to Baron PC taking their reins. And...&quot; He sighed, looking up at the map. &quot;And if Iximaz will not protect my former holdings east of the Wattufs, then I see no alternative but for them to pass to Baron Phobos.&quot;<br><br>He turned to face the Djenni, offering a slight bow. &quot;I pray your mistress will hear my words when I remind her that I, too, was friend to Baron July.&quot; A slight smile quirks his lips. &quot;I have the camel to prove it. In her memory, I would continue her work in the Riding.<br><br>&quot;Yet I acknowledge your own claim also. July was friend to Wechi and Borrd alike, and her builders laid the foundations of many of our fairest buildings.&quot; He turned to the map again, rolling his stylus between his fingers. &quot;Perhaps by the skill with which we raised Manyuel together, we might create from the ruins of Flayme a true and living monument to her endeavours... if our baronies were to meet outside its walls.&quot; He glanced back at the Djenni. &quot;Her answer need not be swift, avatar; let it come as it will.&quot;<br><br>He slipped his stylus into his pocket and turned again to the wider hall. &quot;The concerns voiced by many concerning my proposal to expand this Council of Plort are well-founded, yet I say still that other voices must be heard in the hall of Otik. Baron Neshomeh speaks for Wechi, it is said - but she speaks also for her barony, and their interests may not coincide.<br><br>&quot;So, then, what shall the rule be? I say the rule of one - that whatever delegates the folk of Wechi and the Riding shall send, they should bear between them a single vote. One for the archivists who dwell in the Commonwealth, and one for the Beytahs of the Riding.&quot;<br><br>He paused, seeming about to say more, but then shook his head. &quot;Enough of my words, save this only: four barons have supported the right of Sir Tomash and the Mords of Diskord to speak. That stands at half of those with the right to vote.&quot; He glanced at Kaitlyn, who shook her head slightly. &quot;Unless Barons Phobos, Eshakhar, Juliette, and VixenMage assemble in opposition - which seems unlikely - it seems that the leaders of Ozerbord and the Diskord may place their votes as they will.&quot;<br><br><hr>

            <p>I speak for the Commonwalth of Wechi (supposing that Baroom, the Book Repairman, Dame Eatpraylove, Baron Neshomeh and Thunder won’t object to this).<br><br>We trust our baron, and since there is precedent for one-of-us speaking for the Commonwealth when Baron Neshomeh kept silent, we could always be sure that Wechi’s voice would be heard. Nevertheless, Baron Huinesoron is right – if Barony Neshomeh is extended beyond Wechi, a conflict of interests may arise.<br><br>But we object to the implication that &quot;the archivists&quot; are our civil government. We ask the Baronial Council to exempt us from the task of defining who exactly should be considered an &quot;Archivist of Wechi&quot; and let the majority of <i>all</i> denizens of Wechi who bother to have an opinion decide on the Commonwealth’s vote.<br><br>Although we don’t want to appear rebellious, we wonder how Baron Neshomeh can claim to speak for the Beytahs of the Riding when she clearly resides in Wechi. The Council may want to decree what is required to be a Beytah of Sittorese and whether barons are allowed to be involved in the representation of nations that is, as can be seen with Ozerbord and the Diskord, meant to be independent of barons holding territories in said nations.<br><br>Also, we feel that giving as many votes as there are Morrds to the Confederation of Diskord, while the Refuge of Ozerbord, the Riding of Sittorese and the Commonwealth of Wechi only get one vote each, and the Protectorate of Borrd gets zero votes, may appear unjust.<br><br>Hieronymus the hermit, part-time knight of Wechi, archivist’s apprentice, keeper of the records and (hopefully) by common non-objection current speaker for the Commonwealth of Wechi<br><br>((There. Even more reason to get involved. If you took residence in Wechi, you don’t need to be an acknowledged archivist to be polled on Wechi’s vote. Also, some complicated politicks: Since Neshomeh obviously is a denizen of Wechi and implicitly objects to any Commonwealth vote that contradicts her baronial vote, at least two Wechians who aren’t Neshomeh are needed to make the Commonwealth countervote its baron.<br><br>Sir Ekyl of Godreve and Sir Matthias Snow of Tumblar are currently the only non-barons who obviously reside in the Riding of Sittorese. Some persons of currently unknown residence (An&#39;onere Morysse, Johan the Orange and Twyla Witherspoon) may, by claiming to be Beytahs of the Riding, reveal that they actually live in the Riding of Sittorese (but they either haven’t be seen in a long time or are not known to actually have beta-read anything). <br><br>For maximal involvement, the Council may want to decree that wanderers (currently Aila vyn Sini, Cipher and Sir Hardric) may be Beytahs of Sittorese, based on occasionally visiting the Riding (but Ayla hasn’t be seen for a long time). <br><br>The Barons won’t like it, but if this is a motivational thing, then the few Beytahs of the Riding who aren’t barons anyway should not be discouraged by the expectation that the barons who hold lands in the Riding and also are Beytahs will outvote them anyway. (This expectation may be counteracted by expanding the number of potential Beytahs of Sittorese to everybody who can present evidence that they practiced the art of beytah, regardless of where they live. I’m not sure whether this would be more or less ridiculous than the barons voluntarily limiting their power.) Thus, the barons should be excluded from representing nations and only represent themselves. This would also explain why the Council of Borrd cannot cast votes in the name of the Protectorate of Borrd and this nation has zero votes unless the Borrders rebel against being governed by a council of barons. Of course, it would also exclude Baron  Neshomeh from being polled about the Commonwealth’s vote and thus would allow me to singlehandedly make the Commonwealth countervote its baron, but that’s beside the point.<br><br>I don’t know who and how many the Morrds of Diskord are (apparently Ye Scape-Grace is one of them?). On a meta level, I understand why we need the Morrds, but in-universe, if it is true that Wechi and the Riding (and Borrd) don’t need representation as nations because they are represented by the barons who hold land there, this should be true for the Diskord too, and only Protector Thomash should be invited to represent a baronless region – which could have been accomplished without talking about the representation of nations. But since the cat is on the roof now, giving at-least-but-only-one vote to most nations may be a politickal compromise that can’t be reasonably explained, and the complaint about it being unjust may be ignored.<br><br>HG))</p>

            <p>And revealed a motley assemblage of mostly-humanoid people. Half a dozen in total, five gathered closely around a single slender shape in the centre of the formation. On the left, a wobblingly corpulent figure with a cheerful visage that looked like it would ideally have been wrapped around some sort of cake accompanied a gangly mantis of a woman whose green, furtive eyes and ploughed complexion would have looked every second of its age had it lived for seven centuries. On the right, a battle-scarred mercenary who looked like she&#39;d only retired from combat when she&#39;d run out of bits to have blasted off by <i>pla&#39;tool</i> sorceries glared out from behind a round little dandy in a pea-green frock coat and powdered periwig, whose watery eyes nevertheless held the glimmer of intelligence. Finally, directly behind the central figure was a truly vast man, stripped to the waist save for an enormous red fur coat with beige trim, the better to show off his hugely muscled chest, his constellations of scars, and the strange, spiky growths that erupted from every square inch of his skin like the peaks of the Wattufs.<br><br>They marched in unison until the middle figure was in plain view of the rest of the council, and then she took one more pace forward. She - though it was somewhat hard to tell - was more straight-backed than she had been seen to be in some time, but the most marked change was in her mode of dress. Gone were the rags and lucky heather cuttings that marked her as a tatterdemalion; gone was the faded motley of a wandering jester and kingsfool. Instead, she was decked out in brightest white, the robes of Spelin&#39;s old, old priesthood having been dug out and cleaned until they shone (aided by only the merest application of chalk dust). Of the greatest note, however, were the elaborate apparels that decorated her sleeves and hood; panels of silken cloth depicting intricately-stitched scenes from the holy texts of Spelin Tam-Ara, from Plortish history, and of the oral histories of the Mords, which only recently had begun to be laid down in writing. It was the enormously thick apparel at her neck that was newest, and perhaps most controversial: it displayed the central fess of the flag of Diskord, with delicate lines of alternating silver-filigree and lapis set against the rich, dark grey broadcloth that was a favoured fabric among the Mords; it was also pinned in place, as was traditional for apparels of that nature, by the seven white stars that symbolized the Seven Tjan&#39;ulls, or cardinal virtues of Mordly society. Noh Tyss, the duty of decree, of openness as a sacrament; Djen Tjan, the duty of dialogue over drawn swords, of peace over war; Rhuud Ez, the duty of remembrance, of telling and retelling the legends of the Faith; Nar Cal, the duty of games, of refining the mind and body through the abnegation of work for work&#39;s sake; Oth Urp, the duty of creativity, of gathering knowledge and making it one&#39;s own; Rhex Blucz, the duty of charity, of the sharing of sustenance both physical and intellectual; and Ops Tayrs, the duty of rule, of governance in the name of all and justice for every Diskordant. At her left hand was an elaborate maniple depicting the bearer&#39;s arms in blood reds and cloth-of-gold; in her right, and doing no small amount of service in holding her posture so upright, was the kind of crozier that might have once seen use as a means of hauling Marizu knights down from their horses, the better to pound their wretched carcasses into the mud, its elaborately curved head looking capable of sending a tooth-rattling blow through even the most thickly-padded helm. It seemed fairly martial for a priest, but then, the bearer was (however technically) a Knight of Plort, and well-known as a subordinate of the most relentless scourge of the Marizu to ascend to baronial rank in generations; this was proven by the apparel about her right cuff, which depicted that baron&#39;s yellow roses intertwined with what looked for all the world like agricultural implements.<br><br>The richly garbed figure looked upon the council, too-old greenish-hazel eyes boring into Baron Huinesoron&#39;s own, and said:<br><br>&quot;By the grace of the most holy majesty of Spelin Tam-Ara, whose Well-Written Word dost make itself heard through me, I declare mine desire to be seated at this Council for to represent the will of your goddess. Praise Spelin!&quot;<br><br>And the smile of Ye Scape-Grace shone bright as a yellow sun above Krypton.</p>

It is trimmed with light blue cloth delicately embroidered with scenes from Mordly oral history, but the main body of it is pure white, with an amazingly elaborate pattern picked out in the rich, midnight hue of old ink. The thin trails loop and curl like a forest of vines across the chasuble, giving her the image of the Well-Written Word of Spelin Tam-Ara.</p>

            <p>((Keeping track has been quite easy so far. I desperately need more input!)) <br><br>This Baronial Council was held from the twelfth of July until the fourteenth of July in the City of Borrd.<br><br><b>Attendees:</b> ((so far))<br>Baron Huinesoron<br>Baron Kaitlyn was present, but did not say a word.<br><br>Non-deciding attendees:<br>Knight Ælcalen, mayor of L&#39;Urque<br>Frackles, messenger of Kwenaya<br>Sir Hieronymus the hermit, keeper of the records<br>((Ye Scape-Grace may have been there to present the new nation’s flag, but the keeper of the records did not actually see this happen))<br><br><b>Agenda:</b><br>A change of the rules of procedure – a proposal by Baron Huinesoron to let the archivists of the Commonwealth of Wechi, the Beytahs of the Riding of Sittorese, Protector Tomash of Ozerbord and the Mords of the discord participate in the Baronial Council as <i>voting</i> representatives of their respective nations.<br><br>A new nation – the Council is asked to acknowledge the establishment of a fifth nation, referred to as The People’s Republic of Discord, which took possession of lands in the far east around La Wunj and in the west on the Geymez Plateau.((I’m mean. If you don’t want to be a People’s Republic, somebody must stand up and say so.))<br><br>A new barony – per an invocation of the Edict of Bast, the newly created Baron Eshakhar receives the lands previously held by the permanently absent Baron Cassie, including the part that has last year been ceded to the now permanently absent Baron Thanasius Ampelius. ((I guess we don’t really want to have this proposed and decided by Baron Huinesoron, the historian just channeled his knowledge of how the Edict of Bast works.))<br><br>The relocation of Barony Huinesoron – a proposal by Baron Huinesoron to let him take the lands previously held by the permanently absent barons Araeph and July, but cede the territories south of the River Meibot back to Baron Neshomeh (west of the Auriantym Chain) respective Baron Juliette (east of the Auriantym Chain), making Neshomeh the only baron in Wechi again.<br><br>The disposition of Baron Huinesoron’s western territories – since Baron Huinesoron moves to eastern Borrd and the Riding of Sittorese, he intends to leave what is left of Ozerbord without a baron, but to cede his lands between the River Wep and the Wattuf Mountains, and the Geymez Plateau to Lady Iximaz, who, by another invocation of the Edict of Bast, would also receive the western part of former Barony Thanasius Ampelius. ((What can we do if we don’t want to throw these lands on Iximaz, whether she likes it or not? Can Baron Huinesoron be forced to keep them and hold a split barony, like Thanasius Ampelius did last year? Do we really want him holding all these lands?))<br><br>The status of the City of Borrd – a move by Baron Huinesoron to exclude the capital from his new barony and let the Council of Borrd jointly take baronial authority over this city, as has been proposed on many previous occasions.<br><br>The Warden of Spelin – a move by Baron Huinesoron to appoint Ye Scape-Grace of De&#39;endee as the warden of the Temple of Spelin. <br><br>((New flags – I don’t think that the council has to decide about that. The new nations may have used the opportunity to present their flags to a greater public, but since no resident of the Riding of Sittorese showed up, and Scapegrace did not post in-character as Ye Scape-Grace, I don’t know if and how this happened.<br><br>The council may still decide to create a new version of the Union flag that includes all five nations, but I need in-universe input to make this have happened, and we may not want this to be another proposal made by Baron Huinesoron, although he may be tasked with creating the flag.))<br><br><b>Decisions:</b><br>Since the keeper of the records refused to write down rules that still need clarification, no decision concerning the expansion of the Council was recorded and no non-baron attempted to vote.<br><br>A new nation – acknowledged by a vote of one to zero.<br><br>A new barony – acknowledged by a vote of one to zero.<br><br>The relocation of Barony Huinesoron – decided as proposed by a vote of one to zero.<br><br>The disposition of Baron Huinesoron’s western territories – decided as proposed by a vote of one to zero.<br><br>The status of the City of Borrd – decided as proposed by a vote of one to zero.<br><br>The Warden of Spelin – decided as proposed by a vote of one to zero.<br><br>((I guess we don’t really want this to happen. If there is no opposition, I would at least like to see some barons voice their agreement, so that they can appear on the list of attendees. <br><br>Also, everybody who is not a baron can still request to be put on the list of non-deciding attendees, because you may have been there to watch the events, even if you didn’t say a word. Just reply here with your Plort name.<br><br>HG))</p>

            <p>It had been less noticable in the first hour: broken by Ye Scape-Grace&#39;s presentation of the flag of the Discord, and Baron Huinesoron&#39;s intervention; broken by Hieronymus&#39; proposed flag of the Riding, and his unanswered soliloquy on voting law; broken by messengers from Barons Iximaz and Eshakhar. But now the second hour had rolled around, and in place of lively debate, stillness blanketed the hall of Otik.<br><br>Huinesoron looked up from a whispered conversation with his wife. &quot;Is there no business?&quot; he asked into the quiet. &quot;Is there no argument - nothing to say at all?&quot;<br><br>He got to his feet and walked out into the centre of the chamber. The great seats around him were mired in gloom, the figures enthroned upon them barely visible beneath the backlit banners of their heraldic arms.<br><br>&quot;Baron Phobos,&quot; Huinesoron said, facing the shield of the  Dice and Daggers. &quot;Have you no words? Long have you argued concerning the division of Barony Araeph - will you now let the matter pass unnoticed? And Baron PC,&quot; he turned to the Apple and Axe, &quot;will you not speak for Ozerb- for the western discord? If Lady Iximaz spurns the rule, will you not step into her place?&quot;<br><br>Silence, deep and thick. The baron let out a cry of distress and span, striding across the stone flags towards the banner of the Fox of VixenMage. &quot;Someone in this grand council must have an opinion! If not, why have you come here at all?&quot;<br><br>He passed into the shadows surrounding the tall chair. A moment later, a startled shout echoed through the chamber, and something mint-green fluttered out of the darkness to land in the centre of the pool of light.<br><br>Baron Huinesoron followed, bearing with him an upright stave resting on a wooden base. He crossed to the crumpled pool of cloth and retrieved it, hanging it on the wooden assemblage. The cloak billowed down; in the shadows, it would have looked just like a seated figure.<br><br>Huinesoron turned slowly on his heel. The banners above him were still; the torches flickered softly on the walls; no movement came from any of the chairs.<br><br>&quot;In the name of Kanun and Spelin,&quot; he whispered, clearly audible in the silence, &quot;is there anyone else here at all?&quot;<br><br>((^_^ And yes, that&#39;s confirmation that both flag proposals happened in-universe. ~hS))</p>

            <p>A point of light appeared in the chair below the arms of Baron Neshomeh. It grew into a molten pinwheel and spun itself into the shape of a glowing red-gold fox. It sat primly in the chair and surveyed the room with eyes of emerald flame.<br><br>&quot;I am the Djenni,&quot; it said, its voice seeming to echo itself in a faint whisper. &quot;I speak for Baron Neshomeh. Her campaign against the Subjugator has grown long. The foe is crafty, and the fall of Air&#39;ihpotre has granted it new strength. The Tungsten Monk has gone astray we know not where; Ilraen and the Supernumeraricon grow heavy in Neshomeh&#39;s hands; yet she presses on through the mires of Odd-Ault Fanvik. Thus it is that she remains absent from these proceedings, and sends me to bear her will to the Council.&quot;<br><br>The fox-shape cocked its head as though listening to something at a distance. The echo vanished from its voice. &quot;That is, I will when I know what it is she wants me to say. Please hold.&quot;<br><br>(( I&#39;m here!

            <p>&quot;Ah, here we are. A little connection trouble there; nothing to worry about. Ahem. I shall speak to you now with the voice of Neshomeh.&quot; Her own voice faded to a whisper, and what had been a whisper rang out as the very tones of the Baron herself.<br><br>&quot;Greetings, barons, knights, civilians. My time is short, so I shall come straight to the point:<br><br>&quot;First, we must dispute the distribution of Barony July. July was ever our fast friend, and we grieve most sorely at her departure. In her absence we would take <i>all</i> of her lands into our fold to hold and to make fair in her absence. Her folk in the Riding are well known to us, and we feel we are best suited to lead them.<br><br>&quot;However, let it not be said that we are avaricious or coldly seeking our own aggrandizement. Our heart goes out to our friend Baron Huinesoron in these troubled times. We wish him solace in his new home, and as he has not claimed the city of Borrd, we shall cede him that portion of Barony July west of the Larninkurvs to round out his new holding.<br><br>&quot;Let Barony Eshakhar be be formed of the lands once held by Cassie and Thanasius; this we support wholeheartedly.<br><br>&quot;If Lady Iximaz will not accept any portion of Huinesoron&#39;s former lands, then let the southern parts pass to the Poor Cynick along with Thanasius&#39; former territory along the Wattufs, and let the northern parts pass to Baron Phobos, whom I know will make good use of them.<br><br>&quot;We are in accord with the Cynick in the matter of the Mords and Protector Tomash: let them sit among us. Invite my archivists, too, if you will, but only if you desire endless interruptions to check the facts, to debate the proceedings, to clarify this detail or that. Truly, none could dispute the outcome of a council in which the archivists took part! As for the Beytahs, I am one myself, and I shall speak for them faithfully as warden of those lands in the Riding I claim from July.&quot;<br><br>The Djenni shook her head, and when she spoke next her own voice was foremost again. &quot;I think that&#39;s everything.&quot;<br><br>(( Well, why shouldn&#39;t Baron Neshomeh have lands in the Riding? She is a Beytah, after all, and she does have a lengthy and fraught campaign to support. The Mines of Spyration in particular would be an excellent asset!<br><br>(( She&#39;s against including the archivists as voting members of the Council, but it would be a bit gauche of her to come out and say so. Someone else will have to take the hint and swing that vote if necessary.<br><br>~Neshomeh ))</p>

            <p>A black-clad figure emerged not from one of the designated chairs, but from near one of the side walls. His face was obscured by a hood, but the features that could be made out were very clearly those of Baron PC, the Poor Cynick.<br><br>&quot;The silence is unnerving, is it not?&quot; he asked. &quot;A similar quiet has fallen over Worhkshap in recent months. Bustling activity replaced with empty rooms and unread tomes. So few now seem interested in learning the art of Beytah. Or perhaps it&#39;s just my presence that they cannot stand? Regardless, it is a great shame in either event.&quot;<br><br>He paced past Huinesoron, as if not noticing the man, and faced the map. &quot;Four barons, vanished. And so few of the remaining actually here!&quot; A sick smile came to his face, which looked unsettlingly off in the pale light of the room. &quot;This does not seem to be a position that engenders longevity.&quot;<br><br>After a moment, he pulled a stylus of his own out of the sleeve of his robe. It flared to life with a green light, similar to the color of the gemstone representing Worhkshap. &quot;If Baron Iximaz is unwilling to accept the western discordant lands, then I can take them under my wing,&quot; he said, redrawing the borders to reflect his suggestion. &quot;It is not as if I am unknown to the Mords, after all, nor they to me. There is some measure of respect there.&quot; <br><br>The stylus vanished back into his sleeve. Baron PC stalked over to his grand chair and took a seat. &quot;I have no objection to the other territorial proposals. Nor do I protest the addition of the Mords and Baron Tomash to this council. The archivists and Beytahs, however, are better suited where they are. Wechi already has a representative, as does the Riding.&quot;<br><br>He looked around at the other chairs.<br><br>&quot;I think they do, anyway.&quot;<br><br>((Baron PC might have gone a little kooky away in his castle by himself. Possibly. But he would insist he was completely sane if asked!))<br><br>((Possibly.))</p>

            <p>&quot;As a citizen of this great nation, I suggest that Baron PC&#39;s suggestion regarding the Mords and Tomash be accepted. I dare not presume to speak for the esteemed barons of the Council of Borrd, but I know that even <i>my</i> wanderings barely take me into the discord--the lands previously held by Iric, and Chaett before that. Unless I am mistaken, even Barons VixenMage and Da — *ahem* my apologies, &#39;Juliette&#39; — whose baronies currently extend into the discord, are rarely found therein. Should this Council presume to rule over all of Plort, it must speak with the voices of all of Plort: let the Mords and Baron Tomash vote.<br><br>&quot;In fact (and please correct me if I speak amiss), I propose that the discord not be considered the territory of any baron, but left to the Mords.<br><br>&quot;As for the other of milord Baron PC&#39;s suggestions, I agree once more. The archivists need not vote: Baron Neshomeh already represents Wechi and its interests. As for the Riding of Sittorese, did not the Edict of Bast replace two baronies in Sittorese with absent barons—Baronies Thanasius and Cassie—with the new Barony Eshakhar, and entrust the remaining barony, July, with milord Huinesoron? Sittorese has representation in the Council; leave the Beytahs be.&quot;</p>

            <p>Basically, I have no idea, and I&#39;m struggling to look back at the heraldry after two years and figure out what&#39;s going on and how it could be changed. I also happen to think the current heraldry is very nice as it is, which doesn&#39;t help.<br><br>...ooh, I&#39;ve just taken another look and I may have an idea. For the Elvish arms, what about  adding to the number of quills and shrinking the canta miri birds? Or maybe have a second, smaller set of quills added in...? Hm.<br><br>Okay. I think it might work to either add a second, shorter set of four quills while shrinking the birds and doubling their number. On the other hand, if that turns out as cluttered as I sort of feel it might, maybe it&#39;d work better to leave the birds more or less as-is but add a set of four delicate vines or branches that also come out of the fiery center but twine briefly around the quills?<br><br>Let me know if any of that sounds both feasible and like it might actually look okay. Also, if you have any ideas, I&#39;m open to hearing them.<br><br>(As for the English arms, I kind of want to redesign them just because, but at the same time they do stand for something and I like the symbolism. Maybe just adding a musical note--a fourth or eighth, or else a pair or two of eighths--to the blue and green fields would work well...hmm.)<br><br>As of yesterday, I&#39;m also (unrelated to heraldry) working on a small Plort story. I&#39;ll hopefully finish it and get it up before the thread is done, though I am about to move, so who knows...<br><br>~Zing</p>

            <p>The two different blues are indeed deliberate; so are the two wider grey bars.

            <p>It looks like it&#39;s based on something, is all. (I mean, it keeps giving me flashbacks to the Starbucks logo, but it&#39;s not that, obvs. ;))<br><br>You could probably invert or recolour three of the stars (or I could, if I redraw the flag - you know how I am about compulsively redrawing everything). How confident are you in those numbers, though? I seem to recall three retirements a few months ago, plus Matt giving up ownership - so that&#39;s at least four who&#39;ve &#39;gone&#39;, and four remaining... (Not that I object to the number of stars changing! Very American. ;))<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>... in one of the <i>Doctor Who Unbound</i> audio books (they&#39;re AUs, and actually pretty awesome), that Time Lords will switch sex if they regenerate due to committing suicide. (The one I&#39;m thinking of is <a href="http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Exile_(audio_story)">Exile</a>, the first full-length story to feature a female Doctor. She is probably an AU Three, having escaped from Time Lord justice presumably as Two.)<br><br>Well, so far that pretty much holds up. The two sex-change regenerations we&#39;ve seen are the General standing in front of the Doctor&#39;s gun even when he&#39;s checking whether (s)he&#39;ll regenerate, and the Master literally stabbing him/herself in the back (assuming Simms did in fact regenerate directly into Missy).<br><br>Assuming this is part of the ongoing regeneration from the finale... well, he did trap himself on a deck full of Cybermen and walk in front of their guns while planning to blow the whole place to smithereens. It&#39;s not hard to call that suicide, too.<br><br>(Of course, if you do that, the Doctor practically always commits suicide...)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>This is for multiple reasons. Most of them are below, and are because this audio includes:<br><br>- The Doctor drinking and vomiting (with very realistic sound effects)<br>- Major transphobia, including some voiced by David Tennant<br>- A very loose plot revolving explosive gasses from human waste in the car park at the store the Doctor works in<br>- David Tennant eating dog food<br>- Frequent discussion of poo<br>- Yet more transphobia<br>- Seriously, here’s a quote from it: “Doctor, you have been found guilty of crimes against the laws of time and Time Lord decency. You stole a TARDIS and interfered in the affairs of others, but worst of all, you had a sex-change regeneration.”<br><br>it&#39;s.... really not good.

            <p><i>Everything is canon</i>. :D No, seriously, that&#39;s the premise of the Tardis Wikia: everything is valid to some extent.<br><br>Obviously <i>DWU: Exile</i> takes place in a weird side universe, but that doesn&#39;t mean its physical laws are invalid. (Also it amuses me that it&#39;s yet another story with &#39;future Doctor actor plays a Time Lord who beats up the Doctor&#39; - <a href="http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Arc_of_Infinity_(TV_story)">hi, Colin Baker</a>!)<br><br>But yes. I&#39;ve only listened to the <i>Unbound</i> stories once each, so while I recommend the concept, I can&#39;t really comment on the quality. And no, it&#39;s absolutely not something that&#39;s going to be held up/looked to as canon.<br><br>(In fact, <i>Unbound</i> has already been explicitly made uncanon at least once - the one where the Doctor gets shot immediately after regenerating, and thus regenerates again. Um, no - depending on how it&#39;s done, that would either cause the regeneration to fail, or cause a River Song-esque light show. It certainly wouldn&#39;t cause a second regeneration.)<br><br>But it&#39;s still an amusing idea. And maybe Time Lord Tennant is just... not a very nice person? (In fact... pretty sure he isn&#39;t, thinking about that story.)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Well, hello again. It seems that I have been infected by this, fanfic bug again after some years. I hope I had not antagonised anyone during my leave. if so, I deeply regret it and asked for your sincere forgiveness. I have been writing a new fanfic very recently, since I was smitten by Kuroko no Basuke and for some reason, decided to crossover it with Mount and Blade. it has graphic violence though, so I will be not be sharing it here.<br><br>Lastly, Hello again!</p>

<li>The original spear is an occult artifact that one can use to summon demons, but is better off safely stored in the iD Software &#39;verse than in the hands of any Boarder. Thus, the replica is just a decorative item you can display in your virtual self&#39;s room to impress people. Just make sure you label somewhere that it&#39;s only a replica, otherwise the iDSoftware!US Government will be after you because they&#39;ll think you stole the original, and the only people who have ever stolen the original Spear of Destiny before are the iDSoftware!Nazis.<br><br>2. Cool! Worldbuilding is always nice. Ahaha, I too have my own writing tropes... most of them are essentially the constant aversion of a friend&#39;s tropes, because my friend&#39;s tropes are pretty annoying, especially if one has been analyzing her work for as long as I have. T_T<br><br>3. Thanks for the replica Silmarils. I should probably read the Silmarillion once I&#39;m done with Return of the King, to figure out what action of the original Silmarils is replicated by the batteries in these. But anyway, thanks!<br><br>-Twistey</li>

It&#39;s hard to build upon a world where its main attraction, in this magic, is leaving it. It may be an interesting exercise, but it hurts my heart. I prefer the AWoIaF, but as fanfiction isn;t permitted by the author, all we could legally do is to raise madder and madder fan theories regarding things.

            <p>It is technically called &quot;outside the world&quot; but there is a slight technicality here. The root is the source of all souls, all phenomena, it is everything and nothing at the same time. Everything because it is the source of all things and where everything will return to. Nothing because, well, everything that exists came from a blank slate, a state of nothingness. To touch the root is to recieve knowledge of everything and essentially become god. At the same time, touching the root &quot;returns your soul to whence it came&quot; thus causing one&#39;s death. So a person will become god, but will cease to be a person; his or her very concept will be altered by the experience.  The first and fifth magics draw directly from the root, the second, third, and fourth magics are means to reach the root. Some people such as Void Shiki have an intrinsic connection to the root.<br><br>As a side note, it would be very difficult to PPC Nasuverse fanfic because of how the world works, unless DoSAT has got something to circumvent that.</p>

            <p>Yes magecraft is getting weaker as humanity grows stronger. However this does not actually affect magic as the phantasmal species that are governed by mystery simply moved to the reverse side of the world. It is only humanity that has lost touch with magecraft and mystery due to Alaya-shiki&#39;s interference with the laws of Gaia&#39;s reality marble. Species that are not human such as those connected to Gaia (i.e. True Ancestors) still have a hight level of mystery. At least until Angel Notes and/or Tsuki no Sango happened, but these two events happen only in some timelines.</p>

            <p>Okay, pardon, but I&#39;ll need to get some clarification here and there, if you don&#39;t mind. <br><br>so, <i>what</i> do you intend on using your gore for? <br><br>You want to use it as a technique through which you can criticise immortality? How so? I can&#39;t see how the experience of gore (and, therefore, the experience of seeing yourself get injured and all,) works to subvert and criticise the concept of immortality - surely an immortal would, by a certain point, have learnt to get over all the icky things that happen when they die and then promptly un-die? I mean, the general idea is that gore is feared because it&#39;s a <i>reminder</i> of mortality - the fact that we&#39;re all a bunch of squelching biological machines that could just shut down at any moment like any other machine. This is a fear that is irrelevant to an immortal, hence the name! <br><br>What is your point about video games? Is it that people try not getting killed because they want to avoid gore? I mean, I doubt it&#39;s that point - plenty of videogames lack gore and you don&#39;t want to die in them! Not-dying in videogames is more easily attributed to the whole &#39;I want to win and not lose&#39; mindset. But, yes, I&#39;m not sure what your point there is, pardon. <br><br>What do you intend to show by &#39;describing in graphic detail how it (presumably the gore) hurts the character physically and mentally&#39;? Does this relate to your earlier mention of wanting to criticise immortality? <br><br>Also, surely the lack of death in Mount and Blade is more of a game mechanic, than a function of the game&#39;s canon and worldbuilding? Surely death exists within the plot, and world and all, the plot and world and all being the things relevant to fanfic, over the game mechanics, oy? <br><br>I disagree with the notion that tragedy <i>requires</i> gore, because that is a nonsense notion. It is a tragedy when a young boy grows up without a father figure because his dad&#39;s passed away from diabetes type-two, and it hardly <i>stops</i> being tragic by not having any gore about! Or did you mean something else with that point? <br><br>Your last sentence lost me completely. I&#39;m not sure what gore has to do with a character atoning for crime in the eyes of their mates if they become a bandit. <br><br>Yes, ah, pardon for the barrage of questions. Clarification&#39;d be helpful in getting <i>your</i> question, y&#39;know? </p>

            <p>Well gore can be used to torture an immortal using methods that would kill a normal person. And if one could keep the immortal restrained, said gore would last forever.

            <p>that&#39;s just the experience of pain and misery. Which can, and is frequently associated with gore, but is not <i>inherently</i> tied to gore. I mean, you, yourself mentioned a non-gory example! Drowning isn&#39;t gory but it&#39;s certainly (or very frequently) painful and miserable!

            <p>But remember, in addition to hurting the character, it should also appeal to the reader, for whom gore greatly increases the squick factor and the percieved pain. A writer can describe pain and misery and the reader would sympathize, however they may not be able to understand how bad it is because some of these methods are just so out there. Add a dose of gore and the reader instantly goes, &quot;I DO NOT WANT THAT TO HAPPEN TO ME!!!!!&quot; because gore is assiciated with pain and the amount of pain is related to the level of gore.<br><br>Yes, what I mentioned can be done without gore, and gore may not affect the immortal. However, gore affects the reader, and the reader&#39;s reaction is as much part of the story as the reaction of a character.

            <p>I find that a lot of authors who like to use violence use it much too often. Which in turn, makes the entire thing look very artificial. Think of how the characters think, or how a gamer might percieve enemies in a game. One would not notice a mook or redshirt that got killed by the protagonist. In such cases, a simple phrase describing the death should suffice because no one, not even the one performing the killing, cares about it. On the other hand, if this was a final battle of ultimate destiny against a nemesis, or a boss fight, or anything of emotional significance, then the character begins to notice details. <br>Adding details of the act will add emotional significance to the killing, or hurting, of a character. Basically, it is the difference between &quot;seeing&quot; and &quot;feeling&quot; the violence. So, if the violence is not significant to the characters and plot i.e. hurting a mook, then intricate details should be used less. If it is significant, then more details could, and should, be added. If it is very emotionally significant, then you may do tiny details of you so choose. Although this is my own personal views.<br><br>And yes, gore can be used to point out weaknesses of immortality. In fact, this was done in baccano.</p>

            <p>Aaah, I&#39;ve always hated the concept of some deaths inherently meaning &#39;less&#39; than others (which then, naturally, leads into the concept of other <i>lives</i> inherently meaning less than others.) It&#39;s an ugly, worrying, and rather dystopian concept to me. But, to be fair, I can&#39;t say I&#39;m particularly fond of works in which the protagonists kill swathes of sapient people and not feel a thing about it! <br><br>Although, yes, you do add a very good point - the point of <i>emphasis</i>. Putting more detail in order to show us that, well, this bit&#39;s important! That is a very good point, indeed. Even in cases where the gore doesn&#39;t seem particularly over the top, the impact of the situation can be increased by the detail of it, like, say, someone getting nicked by a knife they <i>know</i> is poisoned, or a character that&#39;s been sheltered and never been injured getting injured and being utterly shocked by it. That sort&#39;ve stuff. <br><br>Gore is, as with everything else that gets put into writing, a technique, and it really can be used to great effect in the right places. As long as it feels like it has a genuine purpose and its presence and appearance doesn&#39;t &#39;overstay that purpose,&#39; as it were, and make it feel unnecessary and weird, gore seems perfectly fine. <br>I think that&#39;s the main issue with gore, over other particular writing techniques - the fact that, given its inherently visceral and sort of ugly nature, you just need to be more careful balancing it, so it doesn&#39;t overstay its purpose and feel all icky. </p>

            <p>And about the lesser life thing, unfortunately it also occurs in real life. Therefore, it is perfectly reasonable for some lives to mean less to specific characters. Since most pieces of fiction are writting partially from the protaginist&#39;s perspective, naturally some lives look cheap because they are, from the protagonist&#39;s perspective at least. In the grand scheme of things, all lives are equal. From the perspctive of an individual, definitely not.</p>

Romero, father of the modern movie zombie and creator of the groundbreaking “Night of the Living Dead” franchise, has died at 77.<br><br>Romero died Sunday in his sleep after a “brief but aggressive battle with lung cancer,” according to a statement to The Times provided by his longtime producing partner, Peter Grunwald. Romero died while listening to the score of one his favorite films, 1952’s “The Quiet Man,” with his wife, Suzanne Desrocher Romero, and daughter, Tina Romero, at his side, the family said.<br><br>Romero jump-started the zombie genre as the co-writer (with John A. Russo) and director of the 1968 movie “Night of the Living Dead,” which went to show future generations of filmmakers such as Tobe Hooper and John Carpenter that generating big scares didn’t require big budgets. “Living Dead” spawned an entire school of zombie knockoffs, and Romero’s sequels included 1978’s “Dawn of the Dead,” 1985’s “Day of the Dead,” 2005’s “Land of the Dead,” 2007’s “Diary of the Dead” and 2009’s “George A. Romero’s Survival of the Dead.”<br><br>The original film, since colorized, has become a Halloween TV staple. Among other notable aspects of the cult classic was the casting of a black actor, Duane Jones, in the lead role, marking a milestone in the horror genre.</i></p>

            <p>This is another thing I worked on while I was gone, and it&#39;s... odd. If you read xkcd, you might recall <a href="https://xkcd.com/1017/">this comic</a>, about making &#39;an extreme sport out of waiting&#39; by calculating the relationship between the amount of time past and the history of the Earth.<br><br>Well, I <i>do</i> remember it... and I decided to do it.<br><br><a href="http://huinesoron.webs.com/ExtremeWaiting.html">Extreme Waiting</a> is a JavaScript implementation of the idea. It comes with three prebuilt timelines (I prefer to go forwards, rather than backwards): the History of the Earth, the History of Writing, and (of course) the History of Middle-earth.<br><br>They&#39;re all exponential curves, so time gets more spaced-out as you approach zero; I have jigged the exponents to get roughly even information density across the timeline, though.<br><br>You can also write your own timeline and paste it in the box - just follow the example of the samples (&#39;@10.05 Event here&#39;, with a space after the percentage). If you do, you can share them here - I might even implement them with their own pictures!<br><br>(It works on Chrome and IE; let me know if there&#39;s a problem on your browser.

It&#39;ll be interesting to see where this goes<br>- Showing canon being back to normal at the end like that is good<br><br>General review:<br>This was rather good overall, and there were a bunch of funny and clever bits. However, one complaint I have is that it feels like there should be a tiny bit more mission in the mission (snark, the occasional badfic quote, etc.). I didn&#39;t get as good a sense of the fic as I usually do, even though I&#39;ve still figured out generally why it&#39;s bad.<br><br>Speaking of subjective complains, it seems like the &quot;I just found out I&#39;m pregnant&quot; bit could use a bit more narrative weight. That seems like a really important event in the story, but it doesn&#39;t even get a paragraph to itself, or much description at all. Makes the revelation a bit underwhelming (unless it wasn&#39;t meant to be a revelation, and was supposed to be a normal-ish thing, in which case ignore this comment)<br><br>- Tomash</p>

            <p>It is now the Twentieth of July in the year 2017. You, like several other people, received an invitation two days ago, written in elegant, loopy handwriting:</p>

<p><i>Dearest friend,</i></p><i>

<p>I am hosting a masquerade this twentieth of July in celebration of my birthday. It would be simply wonderful if you attended! Be sure to dress up for the occasion, should you come; the preferred (but not the only acceptable) colors are black, white, and red - but then, you already knew that. After all, when do I ever change?</p>

<p>Ever yours,</p>

<p></i><p><i>Calliope.</i></p></p>

<p>Having decided to accept your friend’s invitation, you enter the grand manor you were given directions to all those months ago when invited to the Christmas party (a much less formal affair, but memorable all the same) - you know by now that this is not Calliope’s home, per se, but that she is entitled to it all the same. Perhaps it belongs to a relative?</p>

<p>Upon entry to the house, you note the interesting number of other guests already present, and you think you recognize several friends in the crowd, but knowing Calliope she isn’t out mingling just yet.</p>

<p>What do you do?</p>

<p>((Hello, all! Welcome to the Boarder Masquerade! This is a roleplay for, well, a masquerade. From the intro, you may have guessed that it's because it's my birthday. (I hope it isn't too pretentious of me to hold a party, but I did want to do this. I think it will be interesting!) The setting is an AU where we all have access to one another and also to classy clothing. Do keep in mind that this <i>is</i> a masquerade - you've come in a mask, and your identity is thus concealed. Come up with a name or title that isn't your regular Board name and have fun trying to guess who you're talking to!</p>

<p>Also, because I am a very weak woman, there will be Plot Shenanigans. If you did not receive something special from me, don't worry - I haven't forgotten you. Everyone who participates has a part to play; some of you just needed a little... advance warning.</p>

<p>Cheers, all!))</p>

            <p>Completely ignoring Time, she strode forward and up the stairs, moving purposefully towards Spanky. When she reached him, she spoke in a cold, hard tone - "Why have you broken my party, Clown?" Her body language spoke volumes of hostility; the air around her seemed to crackle faintly.</p>

It rolls off of the piano to stand in front of the Hostess, and lightly swats at her masked nose. "As for why I'm here, well, your parties are always so lovely, I couldn't stay away! Besides, what party isn't better with a clown, especially one with a funhouse as fun as mine!"</p>

            <p>The Hostess reaches into her own chest and drew out a pink-tinged halberd, which she proceeds to grip in a manner that indicates many hours of practice. The ground around her for several feet becomes slightly sludge-like, though she does not sink - anyone else standing there sinks perhaps an inch or two, and has a bit of trouble trying to pick their feet up.</p>

<p>Those able to see her eyes might notice that said eyes are no longer green; instead, they seem to be swirling with pink, black, bright blue, and a significantly too-dark green. None of the colors are actually mixing, either. How peculiar.</p>

            <p>Attempting to walk a few more times with no success, it pulls a miniaturized cane out of its pocket, which is shaken to full size. The clown plants the end of the cane into the sludge, attempting to dislodge itself, to no avail. "Well, Callie, it seems you've got me in quite a jam, as it were." Its masked expression briefly morphs into one of thought, before returning to a mischievous grin. "But you should really know better than to think that this would hold a clown of my caliber for very long. Ta for now!" Upon concluding, it once more reaches into its pocket and pulls out a miniaturized mirror. With the flick of a wrist, it assumes its full size, which is a rather impressive three-by-three foot square. The creature tosses the mirror into the air and assumes a diver's pose, with the mirror landing face down on top of it with a faint <i>splat!</i> as it strikes the slime, while Spanky disappears into it. Barely a moment later, the door to the Funhouse swings shut of its own accord and shatters into thousands of tiny fragments which are absorbed into the mirrored balcony, the wooden door revealed unchanged in its place.</p>

            <p>She tightened it so much, in fact, that the halberd snapped, becoming a sort of shiny pink <i>stuff</i> that reabsorbed back into her body. Stepping forward, unhindered by the sticky goo, the Hostess picked up Spanky's escape mirror, stepped out of the ring of sludge, placed it face-up on the balcony, and proceeded to stomp on it in her heels until it was very well shattered. After that, she raised her hands and spoke in that sibilant language - a swirly white thing appeared and the shards also lifted. They then coalesced and exploded outwards, peppering everyone on the balcony (Hostess included) with tiny bits of glass. Thankfully, all of them missed people's eyes.</p>

<p>After she was done obliterating that mirror, she turned back to the circle of sludge, waved her right hand, and - oh, look, the sludge is gone, leaving a plain balcony in its wake, save for the boots partially sunk into the flooring where Spanky had been forced to abandon them. No symbol this time, just more strange eye stuff.</p>

<p>Then, without answering Sapphire's questions, she stalked over to the door Spanky had appropriated and began to mess with it, muttering all the while.</p>

            <p>A barrier of fire appeared, trying to melt as much of the glass as possible. Hot was infinitely preferable to sharp.. He extended it a far as he could to try and cover everyone else. Then he lowered his staff and sighed. "That was...surreal. Almost like the painting incident." Then he casually converted the barrier into a fireball, and blasted the remains of the boots. </p>

            <p>Wolf flash stepped over to the punch. He grabbed the whole bowl, and flash stepped back, dumping it over everyone. "Sorry sorry sorry...was just trying to blunt the sharp edges." He was trying very hard to ignore the fact that he'd been pelted just as much, and that his mask was amplifying every bit of the sensation. "Also...oww."</p>

            <p>The Musician clapped a hand to her cheek where a burning chip of glass had torn a bloody gouge. Staring at the Wolf she raised her hand as though she was going to say something, but only blinked and blinked again before turning it into a helpless shrug.</p>

<p>She was, to put it politely, a mess. She had not dressed with the expectation of encountering fire, molten glass, or punch - her hair was still smoking slightly, her dress was saturated with fruit-smelling punch, and glass had burned a good dozen holes through it. Adding insult to injury, the punch had been strawberry. The Musician was allergic to strawberry.</p>

<p>"Just." She said. "Stop? Please? This was supposed to be a party..."</p>

            <p>There was a gust of wind as they circled the room repeatedly, moving quickly enough that they managed to dodge the punch. Thankfully, both the wind and the material managed to put their dress out very quickly, and they stopped approximately where they had been, glaring at the Wolf. When they heard what he said, they sighed, deflating. "It's alright. I'm okay, at least. You, Musician?"</p>

<p>At the thought, she allowed herself to spend a few minutes arguing with herself about which Street she would even get. Anger? Impatience? Something from the L/O/L glitchpile? Restlessness?</p>

            <p>On this Board were several different types of pieces - chess, checkers, Monopoly tokens, D&amp;D figurines… each piece represented a person or force within her Party.</p>

<p>With a soft hum, she reached into a box of figurines and pulled out what looked like a miniature clown.
“You’ll do,” she murmured as she placed him at the edge of the Board. After a moment, she picked him back up and moved him closer to the center - Spanky would be rather powerful, after all.</p>

<p>Just as soon as he joined in.</p>

<p>After consideration, she moved a few other pieces around - the White Queen, the Black Knight, the Iron, a wooden bell… it was hard to tell whether this affected anything or was just her way of keeping track.</p>

<p>Once she was done moving the pieces around, the Hostess took out a deck of cards and looked them over. “Not bad,” she muttered grudgingly. “I do have to give you some credit.”</p>

<p>Finally, she put the cards down and began to pace. Being ‘dead’ was boring. She wanted to be out there meddling, not observing! Okay, sure, she was still meddling. But she wasn’t out there, dropping more clues, talking to her guests… just sitting in her void, keeping her Board up to date and looking at her cards.</p>

<p>Being passive was so dull.</p>

"You're not the only one," they said, before pulling out the pen they had used earlier and a notepad from a pocket. They wrote down the words and bit their lip. "A code again. Let me just..." They pulled out their cell phone and entered the first code, which didn't take that long to translate. "Madame Who? Oh, no, wait... Could it be?" they murmured to themself. They did a little more, then nodded. "Right, that makes sense." They pulled up something else, typed again. "What? What did- Wait, did she...?" They opened a menu, scrolled down, selected something. "Right, okay- Crumb. This is not good." They looked up at everyone else and sighed. "Well, I may or may not have accidentally killed us all. I am so, so, so sorry."</p>

            <p>The door shudders and jolts. From its bottom, a green ooze begins to seep onto the balcony floor, before covering it in entirety. After a mere moment, the ooze is absorbed into the very being of the flooring, and takes on a reflective sheen. Within the mirror's depths, a figure begins striding to the surface before emerging into the material plane, still walking up the very wall itself for a full two meters, at which point it falls towards the ground. Before striking the surface, however, it arches its back, rolling into a reverse somersault, then propels itself into the air in a double flip, landing with its back to the group and arms raised above its head. Upon realizing it's facing away from the group, it turns and re-emphasizes its pose.</p>

<p>The clothes the figure wears are an odd sort. The left side is a dull bronze in tone, while the right is a vibrant purple, both richly patterned, and a linen shirt below. The pants feature the same purple as the coat, and the same patterning as well. Upon its face is a brightly patterned mask, twisted into a manic grin. Its build is thin and whip-like, with long and lanky limbs. Also long was its hair, gathered together in a high horsetail, with a darkened appearance.</p>

<p>"I see that somebody wants to get into Spanky's Funhouse!" the being exclaims, seeming almost to flow towards the group, the mask moving as though it were the thing's own face. "You've got the wrong door, though! It's over here, you see." It sidles over to the door on the rightmost wall and opens it, spilling out a cloud of noxious fumes. "Oops!" the creature yelps, quickly shutting the door. "Wrong door!" It waves its hands towards the door, and the surface takes on a mirror sheen. The door is reopened, revealing a brightly lit room with vibrant coloring, and a cheery, jaunting tune with no readily discernible source. "Ah! Here it is!" It gestures for the group to enter, contorting its entire form into the motion. "Come now, and let's have some <i>fun</i>!"</p>

<p>((And so enters Spanky the Clown, at long last! For the actual appearance of the clothes, he's wearing Sheogorath's outfit from Skyrim, and for the mask, he's wearing this lovely little piece: https://thumbs.dreamstime.com/x/mardi-gras-mask-beads-1699285.jpg. As for the music being played in the Funhouse, it's this nice little tune: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axUhLTD19xo. Hope you guys have some fun with him. [insert sinister chuckle here]))</p>

They were twitchy, seeming ready to bolt away from anything that might be thrown at them, sleeves rustling in a pattern that might be familiar to someone who had been observing them earlier.</p>

            <p>"Such a pity." The clown said, then reached into its back pocket and pulled out a miniature grand piano. With a flick of the wrist, the instrument assumed a more regular size and thudded to the balcony floor, at which point the creature vaulted to lie upon it in a pose that was obviously meant to be seductive, but most certainly wasn't. "Ah, well. Probably for the best. I suppose you wouldn't be able to make it through, anyways. After all, if my dear thief of a friend couldn't, how would you be able to?" The creature moved to examine its fingernails, a grotesque expression of exaggerated disappointment on its masked visage. "It truly is a shame, though. After all, there are such <i>lovely</i> prizes for anyone who can make their way through."</p>

            <p>"Alas! The curious cat indeed met misfortune, though how was she to know the shark was hungry?" The clown exclaimed, hamming for all it was worth. "And woe is Spanky that he cannot float! Climb walls, yes; walk within the mirrors, yes; bend <i>reality itself</i> to his will, <i>yes</i>!  But floating yet eludes him!" A single tear begins to form in the eye of its mask. "Oh, if only Spanky could award brave party goers with fabulous prizes! That would make him truly happy, yes! But alas! He cannot, unless they can make it through his funhouse. But they do not, and so Spanky must consign himself to be a sad clown, with a sad piano, and a sad funhouse, and a sad funhouse is no fun at all!" As if to confirm that the funhouse itself was sad, the jaunting tune began to warp and slow until it jangled discordantly, and the brightly painted walls began to gray.</p>

            <p>Just as Rod reached the top of the banister with the rest of his group, he stopped as a twisting feeling of foreboding shot up and down his spine.  He whipped around and glanced over every corner of the room he could see, checking for anything that seemed . . . changed.  The chill settled around his heart.</p>

<p>Something was wrong.  Something dangerous.  <i>Room for one more, honey.</i>  Rod shook the thought away.  That was just some line he remembered from an old TV show . . . wasn't it?</p>

            <p>This time, instead of the lights coming back on like the flick of a switch, a fog dissipates from around the fixtures. Once things become visible again - which was about half of the normal light level - you can make out the figure of a body, a female. When the light returns to normal, well…</p>

<p>It’s Calliope.</p>

<p>That… that cannot possibly be right. She was just doing a circuit of the room, wasn’t she?</p>

<p>Wait, no. She was dragging the Cryptographer to the Garnet Ghast.</p>

<p>Or was she laughing at Sapphire?</p>

<p>No, she was messing with Mister Turkey.</p>

<p>No, wait, it was Yatagarasu.</p>

<p>Oh gosh. Where was she? She couldn’t have been in five places at once. It just wouldn’t have been possible.</p>

<p>But you look around and you don’t see her anywhere save for over the railing of a balcony, not only hung but impaled on a spear of some kind. The lights couldn't have been obscured for <i>that</i> long... and you heard nothing.</p>

<p>So what happened?</p>

<p>"Codes, Homestuck references, space warping... Guess she really outdid herself this time," he muttered. Seriously, who sets up their own death on their birthday?</p>

<p>He hadn't noticed anything untoward during the party, and hadn't noticed Cal trying to talk to him. On the other hand, he hadn't been paying much attention. Certainly much less than he should have been, considering the decaying body on the floor. At least people weren't going off in pairs to find the murderer.</p>

            <p>He had only just learned of how bizarre Cal's parties could get in a recent conversation, and he certainly wasn't expecting things to go this way so quickly.  He had watched the body get moved to the floor, and start its rapid decay, and simply didn't know how to react.</p>

<p>Finally, he turned to look at the balcony she had been hanging near.  Rod hadn't noticed any party-goers up there before the lights went out, but that doesn't mean it had been empty.  The group he had been chatting with had, unfortunately, moved on without him while he had stood processing the apparent murder.</p>

            <p>It was a poke he would have recognised anywhere. He would have known it without sight, in a totally pitch black room, no way of visibly perceiving anything at all. It was Cal's poke, and it was very fitting that he would have known it in a pitch black room because the room turned pitch black the very second he turned to respond. And then she was gone. And then there was a commotion. And then Mister Turkey wandered over with a raised eyebrow and looked at the source of the commotion, which was Cal. Except not the poking Cal he was so familiar with - this was a completely new Cal, nicknamed (for lack of any better suggestions) 'dead and mysteriously decaying Cal.'</p>

<p>'Cal!' Mister Turkey howled, placing his hands to his face. He looked frenetically about himself. 'Is anybody else seeing this?! She's <i>dead</i>! Cal!' He pointed. 'She's bloody <i>dead!</i>! Is anybody else seeing this?!' He ran his hands down his face, not entirely sure of what to say next. 'I really liked her, you know! She was really nice! She got us a party and everything!' He blinked twice. 'Is anyone else seeing this?!' </p>

            <p>'If you aren't killing them for good you could probably just tie them up and gag them,' he said, rubbing his chin. Admittedly, the image of a tied-up and gagged Cal, struggling awkwardly on the floor and bumping against table legs and knocking cups down, probably would have created a very different atmosphere than the one they were currently in. He glanced around. The other guests were moving about, peeking at things, pointing, investigating. There was industry, suddenly, in the room. </p>

<p>'What now, you think?' Mister Turkey said, scratching his nose. His personal suggestions would have been 'bury' or 'mourn' or some combination, but he was beginning to think that there was a bit more to this all than those would have helped with. </p>

            <p>...you notice a rather distinct lack of coffee.</p>

<p>Right. Cal hates the taste of coffee, and isn't exactly fond of the smell either.</p>

<p>There is also, however, a lack of tea. There's quite a bit of hot chocolate and chocolate milk, as well as ice cream (which could become ice cream soup, which is sort of beverage-ish), lemonade, and apple juice. Alright then.</p>

<p>You could try to find the kitchen, since the owner of the house might be a little more coffee-inclined.</p>

"And she knows I'm gonna eat this anyway because <i>goshdarn it,</i> this is a party, I'm allowed to have ice cream." Angrily, she picked up a bowl and dug herself out several scoops, using unnecessary force. This done, she seized a spoon and plunged it into her bowl. "Delicious," she growled around the bite. "Rocky road with marshmallows, my favorite. Actually, no, Phish Food is my favorite, but whatever. Close enough. Feen, you want anything?" she demanded, turning to her friend.</p>

            <p>He looked up, inserted the spoon into his mouth, and pulled it out perfectly clean. It looked like it had just been forged. It caught the light and glinted. He placed it to rest in the bowl. </p>

<p>'I like this part of our plan, Leeb,' he said, vacuuming down a segment of his cup of hot chocolate that left his lips boiling hot and steaming, not that he even seemed to notice. 'As much as I like the "mystery solving" part of it and getting murdered and pulled into alternate dimensions and stuff, I think we should try to extend this section of the plan as long as possible. For, erm.' The spoon entered his mouth with a globule of ice cream on it and exited empty and shining and disinfected. 'To give the mystery solving bit better integrity to stand on.

<p>Calliope had to smile at her guests when they were genuinely enjoying themselves, as Lady Red and Victory were so obviously doing. Granted, Lady Red was all huffy about her diet (those things always struck her as a little silly, anyways, but she'd never had reason to seriously consider one so she was probably A Little Biased and Lady Red might have been on one for a good reason and okay now she felt a little bad), but she was certainly enjoying the ice cream!</p>

<p>Calliope was a little sad nobody got the joke with the ice-cream cake though. Oh well, someone who did would show up sooner or later. Preferably sooner, but given his other concerns, it would be a while.</p>

She nodded to herself; yes, that had sounded nearly as good out loud as it had in her head. She finished off the rest of her ice cream and left the bowl and spoon in what appeared to be the proper receptacles. "C'mon, Fee--Mister Turkey, there's something strange happening. Let's go poke it with a stick." With that, she set off back towards Cal's corpse, filled with determination and several more Doctor Who references.</p>

They were nearly to Cal's body by that point, and the Crimson Woman pulled something that looked like a metal pen out of her glove. She grabbed the end of it and pulled; the thing telescoped out, becoming a sizable metal pointer. She held it up straight in front of her, grinning. "Even has a magnetic point," she said.

And what the heck are you doing?</i> they thought, and then quickly sobered up as they answered their own question, <i>No doubt it will involve a good deal of death that is a lot more real than whatever just happened.</i> They sighed and wondered why they ever agreed to coming to the party; this was clearly going to be one wild night.</p>

<p>The birthday girl shouldn't die on her birthday. Sure, people should end off on a high note, but this was just wrong.</p>

<p>Overcoming his fear of dead bodies and excessive amounts of blood, he made his way over to where Calliope had fallen. Who in their right mind would put a spear right where the birthday girl would fall? That's some bad interior design, right there.</p>

A white dress with black in the front and chest featured white gemstones, so small they looked like snowflakes in the black cloth. Black high heels completed the look. <em>Oh gosh, oh gosh, oh gosh HELP</em> was all that was running through her head in this moment, aside from the fact that their hostess was dead.

Their sleeve rustled, then a flaming sword shot out of it and into the Ghast's hand. "For Rome!" they shouted, before charging towards up the stairs and towards the door. They made sure they were being slow enough to be followed, but it was still something of a run, because the Ghast was, at heart, a very dramatic person. When they reached the door, they withdrew their sword and pulled their phone out of their pocket. They stared at the door, typed into their phone, frowned behind their mask, typed some more, frowned again. This went on for some time, and really wasn't all that interesting to watch. Finally, though, they gave a triumphant cry. "I got it!" they said, turning to look at everyone else. "I think I can get it to open. Is everyone... relatively ready for whatever might be on the other side?"</p>

They fingered the cards in their pocket. "Also, I have some magic powers, and I think that if any of the rest of you do, you should tell us, so that we'll be slightly more prepared.

            <p>However, it exploded inward, towards the room it had been sealing off. In turn, more of the black fog rushed out, completely enveloping the Garnet Ghast and coming quite close to taking the Musician.</p>

<p>Inside the fog, the Ghast could see, hear, or smell nothing. They could hardly feel their feet on the floor. What they could feel quite clearly, however, was cold.</p>

<p>That didn't do it justice. That made it sound like you had walked outside during winter, or touched an ice cube. This was more like the fog was leeching all the heat from your skin without seeming to warm up in the least.</p>

            <p>Clearly, something was going on here. The Musician bent down, still holding the bell aloft, and picked up the card. "Knight" was an interesting message- she'd have time to investigate it further when Garnet wasn't getting eaten by empty nothingness. She tucked it into her pocket next to the other one...</p>

<p>It felt like she was getting torn in half. It felt like she was standing beside herself, the universe pouring through a gap torn in her soul. It felt like she was falling- burning- she couldn't even scream, it was so intense- and then she was filled with light where she had never noticed how empty she was.</p>

<p>She picked herself up off the floor - apparently she'd collapsed without even noticing it, planned and coordinated tones from her bells replaced with a discordant jangling. She didn't notice it, but she was glowing, slightly - although that faded quickly.</p>

            <p>There. It had to be her. Or, well, it didn't, but they had to take the chance. They Stepped towards her. Once. The fog grew colder. Twice. Even more so. Three times. It was freezing. They stopped. The fog started rising to its earlier temperature. Okay, so trying to get out of it was a bad idea. They closed their eyes, feeling the earth beneath them, and slowing their breathing down. It had started to speed up once they had realized they were basically trapped, but hyperventilating was probably a bad idea. Slow, calm breaths were better.</p>

Four notes later, the wind rose at her call again- and then she reached for her new abilities too. What did it take to burn off cold fog? Light.</p>

<p>She had thought she was full of light already, but now she understood it was only the dawning, the first glimpses of a greater day to come. A new glow poured out of her and into the darkness, the warm brilliance of a summer day. All she had to do was point and the light focused, intensified, a wave of illumination racing into the fog.</p>

            <p>The Musician had gotten to the party on time, indeed, with time to spare. Her carefully-laid plan to be the perfect socialite had lasted for the time it took her to make two key realizations: One, that she'd completely misunderstood the concept of "fashionable lateness", and two, she knew the chamber orchestra's cellist. The two had talked, griped about composers and divas, and the Musician had completely missed the start of the party proper.</p>

<p>Now, as she stood and took in the crowd, she wondered if she hadn't underdressed.</p>

<p>The Musician wore a simple gown, white silk dropping from a high Empire waist almost to the floor. Her jewelry was similarly simple, a silver treble clef resting in the hollow of her throat and, for those with quick eyes, a matching silver bass clef on a chain around her ankle. She was accompanied by her own music; an array of silver bells and steel chimes hung from her braided and coiled hair and sang in key with the orchestra. Eyes the color of violin strings sparked behind a simple dove-gray domino mask; while most of her face was clearly visible some art or artifice obscured her identity and left her familiar but anonymous.</p>

            <p>He is dressed simply: black slacks and socks, black shoes with no laces, a white dress shirt with tiny black pinstripes.  (He doesn't do red.)  A pocket watch hung from a fob in his shirt pocket, but the glass was cracked, and the watch stopped at an odd hour.  brown hair which . . . <i>really</i> should have been cut before the party was the only part of his head visible, as his face was entirely obscured by an ugly miser's mask.</p>

<p><img src="http://mask-maker.com/images/masks/large/wilfred_harper/1.jpg">Exactly like this.</p>

<p>Seeing the Musician nearby, he stared for a moment, gulped, and approached her.  "Hello, there," he said lightly, hoping he didn't come off as creepy.  "I'm a bit late.  How has the party been?"</p>

            <p>"A pleasure. I'm going by the Garnet Ghast tonight." They smiled, although admittedly, it was rather hard to tell through their ever-smiling mask. They noticed the piece of paper, and asked, "Ah, did our hostess give you one of those, too?"</p>

They also leaned in, and whispered, "Yes, we got one, too. I was able to decipher it using my phone, and if I can see yours, I can see if I can decipher it for you.

            <p>Moments later, you hear the clacking of heels on marble, and feel a sharp tug as space seems to rearrange itself. A spotlight comes on, shining at a balcony connected to the main floor by two staircases, one curving along either side of the room.</p>

<p>In the center of the spotlight stands a woman in a suit - a white shirt covered by a deep red vest, with black slacks and a black suit jacket (though the cuffs were the same red as the vest). She also wears what looks like it could be a small red cravat, tall black boots, gloves - white at the fingers, less opaque the farther up they go - and a mask. This mask is black with red trim below the eyes, and has a smattering of garnets towards its top which glimmer a bloody crimson in the spotlight, but is otherwise rather plain. It does, however, leave her bright green eyes unconcealed.</p>

<p>What surprises you more than anything is her hair. Gone was the long, mostly-straight hair you had seen for the past six months; now, the chocolate-colored hair is cut just short of her shoulders, and is more wavy than anything. You also take a moment to notice that she decided that bright red lipstick was a good idea... how typical of Calliope.</p>

<p>“Ladies and gentlemen,” she announces after a moment, “welcome to my birthday masquerade! I thank all of you for coming, though I do realize that we still have a few guests still on their way. Please, enjoy yourselves.”</p>

<p>Her grin at that point unsettles you. The lights come back on, but you barely notice.</p>

<p>"After all, parties don't last forever."</p>

            <p>He was a tall and imposing figure, with a simple black and white tux adorning his lanky body, making him look elegant and poised as opposed to awkward. The only defining features were a bird mask with a long portruding beak covering the upper half of his face above his mouth and a long, almost comical, top hat. An obnoxious grin was clearly displayed as he walked, pausing once as if searching for something in particular before continuing further into the room.</p>

            <p>She tugged at the silk of her dress, her self-consciousness easing slightly as she saw the myriad of fancy costumes in the room. She'd worried she'd overdone it, with the ballgown the color of wine and the silver tracing the bodice and down to the hem in a curlicue pattern. A black, satiny mask covered the upper half of her face, and was touched with the same silver pattern as her dress. Her gloves, too, were black and satiny. Her dishwater-blonde hair was pinned back (with ruby pins, no less) so it fell in a waterfall of curls down to her shoulder blades. </p>

<p>She had a secret.</p>

<p>Taking a deep breath, she stepped further into the party, looking for any familiar faces in the crowd.</p>

            <p>He was squat and round, wide-shouldered and bumpy, padding in awkwardly, bumping against guests and knocking poorly shined shoes against table legs and saying 'Phwor, pardon!' He resembled a bowling ball in both dignity and appearance. This was a fact that he was deeply aware of, and he took advantage of it. The bowling ball theme for his mask, he thought, was a brilliant plan, and the only thing that could possibly go wrong would be a chance meeting with somebody else, or, even worse, a chance meeting with exactly ten somebody elses themed after bowling pins. The havoc would be unstoppable, maybe moreso because he was terrible at bowling. The mask covered his head, went over and around and stopped right at his mouth. He was grinning like he had seen something funny. He was grinning like a wiseguy punk who found many things funny. The jacket was red, the shirt was black, the tie was white. He had seen Billy Joel wear something similar, and it had looked very good on Billy Joel. How good it looked on <i>him</i> was a subjective matter that he, for now, had let slip from his mind. He was still very proud about the 'bowling ball' theme. So he stood there, looked around, and grinned. He knew his friends. He'd recognise them in a <i>second</i>. All he needed to do was wait for all these blithely wandering strangers to move out the way, give him a clear path of sight. That was all. He grinned like he had seen something funny. </p>

That sounds like the name of some person who I've never met and who isn't me, despite it being a very honourable and majestic sounding name which I have never heard of, which belongs to a person who isn't me and who I've never met, though he sounds like a very intriguing and perhaps handsome person that I would bloody <i>love</i> to meet,' he inhaled.

            <p>Mister Turkey planted a single finger over his mouth and leant in, glancing left and right. 'Arright, arright, okay! But this is a costume-thing, don't go bloody howling my name and flaunting it around like it's a bloody flag, right?!' he hissed. 'Really hard not to figur... What -
 what is even that distinctive about me?!' he asked, boggling, bowling ball mask glinting in the light, clumsy figure bumping a nearby table and sending cups rattling, conspicuously short stature catching him in a realm of eye-level torsos and legs. He couldn't put his finger on it for the life of him. </p>

            <p>it was slow, subtle, majestic. In a moment, the clumsy, pottering bowling ball had disappeared, and what remained was mysterious, tempting, esoteric. 'Call me-' And then all the lights went off, and he released a panicked grunt and stumbled somewhere and bumped someone who, also, released a panicked grunt, stumbled somewhere, hit someone else, causing <i>them</i> to release a panicked grunt, until the darkened room was echoing in a chain of panicked grunts and stumbles. He watched Cal's entire presentation, glanced at her red lipstick and thought 'how typical of Calliope!' </p>

<p>And when the lights came back on all the dignified grace he had somehow built up had long dissolved, and he looked up at the stranger and said: 'Uhr, I'm Mister Turkey. But not, bloody, the warbling chicken-thing Americans celebrate sometimes, it's when you get three strikes in a row. In bowling. So it's victory. I've essentially called myself "victory."' He wondered, for a moment, why he didn't just call himself 'victory,' as opposed to a warbling chicken-thing Americans celebrated sometimes. He looked back at the stranger. He grinned, took their hand, shook firmly. 'So what am I meant to call <i>you</i>?' </p>

            <p>'Erm,' he said to the shifting, quietly chatting wall of flowing fabrics and legs and intertwined arms that had appeared around him. He blinked. Lights was nowhere to be seen. He had just figured out who they were, too, had been prepared to leap upon them with that knowledge and shove it down their throat and laugh mirthfully, exclaiming their real name and flaunting it around like it was a flag. He frowned, scratched his head, shrugged, and began pottering, once more, through the party. </p>

            <p>A teenaged... person (for their gender was indistinguishable) nervously slipped through the doors, clearly not wanting to be there very much. Their delicately cut suit was made of complimentary shades of white and blue, fading into each other where the colors met, and shot through with silver and black. The pants and jacket hung loosely off the person's slim frame, and the shirt was made of a flowing gray material. Their mask was an intricate affair of dark blue and black feathers flowing up from ornately filigreed black metal that covered most of the person's face except for the bottom quarter. The exposed part of their face didn't reveal much about them. Short, fluffy gray-brown hair could be espied on the back of their head where the feathers stopped. Their eyes behind the mask seemed to be all different colors; blue, then green, then grey, even brown. This person, after coming in, found the nearest unoccupied wall space and stood there fidgeting, obviously impatient to be gone.</p>

            <p>The man in the plain mask noticed the person fidgeting by the wall and decided to make conversation.</p>

<p>"Hello," he said, adjusting the sleeves of his jacket for the umpteenth time. "Do you, um... have any idea what we're supposed to actually be doing here tonight?" he asked. To his mind, it was perfectly logical to ask the most uncomfortable person at an event what one ought to be doing. This had led to some... interesting... experiences in the past.</p>

            <p>The person said, in a low, mumbling voice. They looked down in embarrassment, and then to the side, twitched, and looked generally uncomfortable. </p>

<p>At last, they made a brave attempt at conversation: "Um... so, what's your name?" They cringed slightly, that was a stupid thing to ask, and tried again. "I mean, not your real name, of course. That would void the entire purpose of such an event," they flushed and stuttered, "Just... I mean, what should I call you? If we're making conversation, that is." Their voice began to trail off awkwardly, "Uh... Never mind." </p>

            <p>The lower part of their outfit seemed to be a dress that had several layers to it, each a subtly different shade of deep red. The layers all touched the floor, completely concealing the person's legs and feet, although somehow, it never seemed to give them any trouble as they walked through the room. Not once could they be seen to even pause as if the dress had caught on something. The shirt was also rather feminine, and the sleeves were slightly loose, dangling a little and with frilly cuffs that concealed whatever might be inside them. However, if they were indeed a girl, they were an incredibly flat-chested one, given how the shirt seemed to fit. They wore a mask that completely covered their face. It was of a slightly different shade of red from the cowl that the figure had drawn over their head, which conveniently prevented anybody from seeing the color of their hair, and had a number of silvery-white lines running across it. These lines seemed to run from the mask onto the cowl, and from there down and across the entire costume, giving it the impression of trailing small lines of mist wherever it went. The mask wore a gentle smile that disguised the true expression of the one behind it, and the eyeholes had mirrored, silvery lenses that allowed the wearer to see others with perfect clarity, but did not allow even a hint of their true face through. Not even the figure's hands were visible, for they were covered in red gloves that also bore the white lines of the rest of the costume. </p>

<p>The figure surveyed the room, true opinions hidden behind the serene smile on the mask. Finally, they started gliding along the wall, but before they could do... whatever it was they were doing, they bumped into a man in a simple black cloak with enough force to send them stumbling back a little, although amazingly, they didn't trip on their dress and fall down. "I'm sorry," they said once they regained their balance. "Are you alright?"</p>

            <p>"Yes, I'm quite all right, thank you." The figure dusted his black cloak off after getting up. He hoped he didn't have to properly talk to them; he was mostly here for the intrigue of the thing, and to humor the hostess, more than for the sake of actually <i>talking</i> to anyone (a prospect that, frankly, was rather unappealing to him).</p>

            <p>A breeze passed near the Herald's face as the rustling sound started. When the lights came back on, the Garnet Ghast was standing a fair distance away, and one of their sleeves was moving ever-so-slightly. They exhaled a little, and wafted towards the Herald. "I'm sorry about that. I didn't hurt you, did I?"</p>

A few searches, a scrap of paper, and suddenly, they looked up at the White Wolf, triumph radiating from them. They leaned in close to the White Wolf and whispered something in his ear, then looked after the Hostess. "It's funny.

            <p>The Concerned One entered soon after, dressed in a simple yet formal black suit and red tie, with an undecorated half-mask covering everything above the tip of his nose. His dark hair was shaved on the sides but long enough to curl a bit on top, but no other features were noticeable. He looked around the party scene, clearly uncomfortable for some reason; an observant person could have heard him mutter, "Here we go," before he walked further into the room.</p>

            <p>Someone slips into the house.</p>

<p>Dressed in a suit the colour of wine, the person's face was almost completely hidden behind an intricate clockwork sculpture that slowly ticked and shifted about. It was quite honestly a miracle how it didn't break the person's neck, based on how complex it was.</p>

<p>He, for he was male, moved to mingle with the crowd.</p>

            <p>The Raven sighed longingly, acutely aware of the time of the night and the time of her breakfast that morning. "I haven't eaten since this morning. Gosh, you're making me hungry, now." She looked over towards the food again. "Cake sounds great, but my eyesight isn't the best. I can't see any at the moment."</p>

            <p>There are three cakes - a red velvet cake, a cheesecake, and an ice-cream cake. The red velvet is in the shape of the Hylian Shield (and frosted to match), the cheesecake has no adornment but is very large, and the ice-cream cake reads "HAPPY GRADUATION". There are also several trays of cupcakes, several of cookies, and so many dishes of candy.</p>

<p>In fact, you don't see any food that isn't a sweet. Wow. Callie's legendary sweet tooth was not exaggerated at all, it seems.</p>

<p>You do, however, spy two face-down playing cards on the table. At least they <i>look</i> like playing cards. They seem to be from two different decks; one has a capital A worked into the back, and the other has a capital C.</p>

            <p>"Wow," they thought, "That's a lot of dessert. Impressive sweet tooth, Cal." Glancing over the table, they noticed the cards and raised an eyebrow, muttering under their breath, "Huh, interesting." Not noticing the Raven and Springs eyeing the cards, they picked both cards up and slipped them into their pocket. The red velvet cake looked appetizing, though mainly due to its impressive frosting job, and so they grabbed a slice of that too, before drifting away to the nearest wall again.</p>

            <p>They stopped, eyes widening in shock as they felt themselves grow somehow. The plate of cake dropped to the floor unheeded as Sapphire doubled over, breathing heavily, as magic took root in them. Their thought process ran something like: "This is weird and not supposed to happen. Was there something in that cake? Oh, wait, this is Calliope's party, why am I surprised? Of course weird things are going to occur. Also, I have magic now. This is awesome! I wonder what I can do with it? I guess I'll find out. Darn, I dropped my cake. Guess I have to go get more." They stood up again and tried to straighten their suit unobtrusively, wondering how many people were staring and doing their very best not to look around and find out. Sapphire decided on second thought to not go back to the table, where there were no doubt several people gathered, and continued to head towards the wall.</p>

"Hey," she said to her clockwork companion as she snagged a cupcake from the nearest tray, "look, normally I'd grab both of those cards over there for myself, but normally I don't have somebody with me."

            <p>The doors swing open, and the diminutive figure of a classy young lady in a crimson Victorian-style dress makes her way into the party. She pauses at the door, adjusting her mask- a black, feathered affair that covers only the top half of her face but does nothing to conceal her mouth or the color of her hair- medium length, brown and spilling down her back in a low pony tail. 
As she raises her arms, it becomes apparent that a pair of wings in the same color of scarlet, are part of the dress, attached to her wrists- when she moves her arms, they move with her. 
"Well," she says, grinning. "This should certainly be interesting."</p>

            <p>Last night, I updated the  <a href="https://technodann.github.io/PPC-board-2.0/archive/">Board altchives</a>.<br><br>This year&#39;s update includes:<br>- The Board archive updated through last night (the Board currently goes back to somewhere in October 2015)<br>- All of the old Other Board<br>- All of T-Board from the beginning of 2016 (the post-New Year&#39;s Board outage) to now<br>- Fixes (applied retroactively) for the Cyrillic text problem (aka, the one where I declared the Board was often in Windows-125<b>1</b>, as opposed to the correct Windows-125<b>2</b> because of a typo). This means that the mini-Missingno Pokйmon is has gone off to live on a farm somewhere.<br>- Similar fixes to escape a few characters that T-Board considers formatting, like ^. This means some people&#39;s emoticons are no longer floating in mid-air.<br>- Very importantly, link maps! These <tt>.csv</tt> files (because I haven&#39;t figured out a better place where to put them yet (suggestions welcome!)) allow you to convert between Board (or Other Board, and so on) links and archive links. However, this data can&#39;t be recovered for the older scrapes, and so is only available starting in October 2015.<br><br>Because of the updates and changes (especially the attempted data corruption fix), could anyone who&#39;s been keeping copies of the archives (or anyone who wants to start doing that) let me know how they want their new versions delivered (I&#39;ve forgotten who&#39;s part of my distributed backup system, honestly, which is why I&#39;m asking here). Similarly, hS, how would you like to get the new versions of the spreadsheets?<br><br>- Tomash<br><br></p>

            <p>Um, have you put the Other Board and T-Board into the same list? As in, in-line with the Board? That seems like an odd decision to me.<br><br>I forget how you gave me the spreadsheets before - it must have been either straight email or by upload to Google Drive.

            <p>The main reason is the internal architecture of the archives and T-Board. Specifically, the way the archival process works is that various bits of scraping code (the script that hits a YWA board and the function that dumps segments of a T-Board) output the contents of their respective post-containing thing in a specific format (Ruby Marshal dump of lists of hashes and lists). Then, there&#39;s another bit of code that takes such an   archive files and posts it all to a T-Board instance. In order to make it easy to distinguish the archives from everything else, all archived posts are posted by the user &quot;Archive Script&quot;. (This started as a workaround for needing the posts to be posted by <i>some</i> user account, and turned out to be useful.) Finally, there&#39;s a series of commands and scripts (which I really need to chain together in a more automated way) that&#39;ll get T-Board to output the posted archives into the format everyone sees (and a different, much smaller, set to generate the spreadsheets)<br><br>The reason there isn&#39;t anything more principled to store multiple archives is that the current system works and I&#39;m lazy.<br><br>This system also has the advantage of making it easier to compute statistics over all our various boards. For example, here&#39;s some information about the number of posts per day we make<br><br><pre><br>   Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. <br>   0.00   22.00   37.00   43.05   56.00  317.00 <br></pre>
