            <p><a href="http://plort.wikia.com/wiki/The_History_of_Konti-Nyuum">The History of Konti-Nyuum</a> (newly revised, with thematic maps interspersed into it).<br><br><u>V. The Age of Change</u><br><br>Change, it seems, is inevitable. It began with the election of four new barons; for by the Edict of Bast, three of them took their lands in the western regions of Konti-Nyuum. In the annual baronial council of Plort, eight nobles vied for control of the increasingly crowded Borrd and Ozerbord - while in Wechi, Neshomeh alone held dominion. Of the barons of Iric, Juliette and VixenMage, who each watched over vast swathes of land, almost nothing was heard. Tensions grew ever higher.<br><br>Another invasion drove the first wedge between the patterns of past and future. The vile Green Ads, bandits and masters of stealth, swarmed across Borrd, rendering travel between its cities and towns perilous even for the best-armed among its people. All effort was made to banish them, led by two key figures: Huinesoron, who beseeched the gods Spelin Tam-Ara and Kanun Syorn for relief, and Tomash, mayor of the town Teebor, who sought to cast great wards about the whole of Plort.<br><br>The confrontation between the two was brought to a head by the arrival of the Inter&#39;Nelerors, savage flying beasts from beyond the Mistwall that swarmed across Borrd and Ozerbord alike. With their refuge shattered, the people fled to Wechi, turning in fear to the gods of distant Wechi-Ah; yet it was not gods who brought salvation. By the power of Programm&#39;an, Tomash spread his protection across the skies of Ozerbord, creating the Refuge anew. In doing so laid claim to the title of Lord Protector, ousting Baron Huinesoron from the position.<br><br>Confined to Borrd, the Inter&#39;Nelerors were swiftly dispatched, but there was another crisis to come: Ofum, long the fortress and training ground of Plort, was burned to the ground by hands unknown. The knights of Plort wavered, unable to press their attacks against the Marizu.<br><br>The Baronial Council convened in an atmosphere of despair, yet from it sprang hope anew. Forts were raised in Ozerbord and Wechi, to take up the burden of Ofum&#39;s loss. A new city was inaugrated at Critta-Kalthin, to trade with distant lands. And a new nation was created: the Riding of Sittorese between Borrd and Iric, taking the fertile lands that were once Thalia&#39;s and using them to feed the armies of Plort.<br><br>Iric did not protest the appropriation of its lands. In fact, very little news was had out of the far eastern lands, and over the months that followed the council, utter silence fell. None travelled down the untended roads between Tumblar and La Wunj; no ships sailed the sea routes between them. The land of Iric was deserted, and when Baron Huinesoron in his wanderings brought its tattered banner to Borrd, the nation was declared lost.<br><br>Over time the people drifted back, from Borrd, the Riding, and lands overseas, drawn by the lure of empty fields ripe for the taking. They had no leaders, no laws or structures of politics; discord reigned among the rivers between the mountains. But out of it something new arose, a nation of factions and divisions, unlike anything that had been seen on Konti-Nyuum.<br><br>The time was coming when the maps of Plort would be redrawn once more...<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/z20VTEA.png"><br><br>Or... welcome back, once again, to the Protectorate/Union of Plort, Konti-Nyuum! This is the answer to the question &#39;what if the PPC community was actually a medieval kingdom&#39;, and it&#39;s been providing us with fun and bemusement for a few years now. You - yes, you! - are a citizen of the Union - a knight, a civilian, or a baron. There is a handy <a href="http://plort.wikia.com/wiki/Beginner%27s_Guide_to_Plort">Beginner&#39;s Guide</a> to get you oriented, and a whole wiki attached to it.<br><br>This is the thread for you to tell us your story, whether you&#39;re new to Plort or just need to update it. Transform your history into Plort-speak (the <a href="http://plort.wikia.com/wiki/Glossary">Glossary is helpful here) and write it up, and we&#39;ll put it on the Cyclopaedia/wiki for you. </a><a href="http://plort.wikia.com/wiki/Huinesoron">Mine looks like this</a>, for instance, and you can hunt down any other Boarder&#39;s that you&#39;re interested in. (Be aware that the map above is as of the Fall of Iric. It hasn&#39;t been updated to reflect new developments... it will be.)<br><br>This is also the thread for heraldry! The original purpose of Plort was to give me an excuse to draw heraldic shields for people, and that certainly hasn&#39;t changed. The College of Arms at Castle Maklaur uses two styles of heraldry: Inglish and Alvish. <a href="http://plort.wikia.com/wiki/Heraldry">There&#39;s a guide to those, too</a>. If you can describe your shield(s), either in formal heraldic speak or just in words, I&#39;ll be delighted to create it for you. (And if you want to put together a description of a Marizu warlord you&#39;ve fought, and create heraldry for them, that&#39;s fine too! There&#39;s even a section on it, and <a href="http://plort.wikia.com/wiki/Category:Marizu_Heraldry">a few that already exist</a>.<br><br>Finally, this is the thread for the Council of Plort to take place. This is an in-universe RP to which everyone is invited, though only Barons (currently) have voting rights. It&#39;s where we both play around with fictional politics, and try to update the setting to match the current state of the community. I&#39;ll be making a sub-thread for the Council shortly. It&#39;s... going to be a busy one. (This is where we&#39;ll be updating the map. Hooooo boy.)<br><br>Last thing, I swear - Plort is for fun. Plort is not for attacking people. I hope I don&#39;t have to say that.<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/qMqrD5E.png"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/bYp9BuE.png"><br><br>Huinesoron, by the Grace of Kanun Baron of Plort, <s>Protector of Ozerbord</s>, Warden of the Fanvik-Whirl, Master of Kwenaya, Friend of Medellurth, &amp;c &amp;c</p>

            <p>I don’t actually know what it should look like, but I feel that the flag should somehow represent the conflict of &quot;imagination&quot; versus &quot;sticking to the rules (of kanun and spelin)&quot;. I would like to use octarine to represent imagination, but obviously we cannot draw that. But then, this may be the reason why after two years there is still no image of the Riding’s imaginary flag, just a vague description?<br><br>HG</p>

            <p>It&#39;s established that the Riding uses the <a href="http://plort.wikia.com/wiki/Acacia">Arrow of Acacia</a> as its symbol; we (because apparently no-one opposes Baron Huinesoron claiming baronial lands in the Riding) could use that to divide the flag in two, with one half octarine, the other half... well, grey is a traditional Plortish colour, and would represent the Grey Lady, who lived in the Twin Temples.

            <p>Business was good today, but nothing of any real importance happened in her life specifically. Just daydreaming about becoming a knight. Wiping sweat from her forehead, she sits down behind the counter to think about where she&#39;s been...<br><br><i>Twyla Witherspoon was not always worthy of residence in the Protectorate of Plort, as she had only just recently started caring about the Marizu and their deeds. Her voyage to Konti-Nyuum started early; at age eleven she unknowingly founded a small band of Marizu in the country of Staar-Wos. She also caused the existence of monstrosities in Mayen Croft (a large and mainly Marizu area of Vidya Gaym) and the Airi-junal Islands. Only one or two years ago, she very nearly avoided the generation of more Marizu in Tiu Fort (also in Vidya Gaym) and Sti Venkeen. None of these things affect Twyla&#39;s conscience, and what little of it finished the journey to Weab was kept in the small but wild nation of Sk&#39;ratsh. Indeed, she cannot wait to announce her knowledge to her fellow citizens of Borrd and thus open them to attack!<br><br>Twyla discovered Plort, specifically Wechi, through absentmindedly attempting to divine images of the Marizu in a bowl of Guugol fluid. Curious, she set off for Wechi, and immediately knew that Plort was where she wanted to stay. Upon her entry in Borrd, she caused a bit of commotion in front of Baron Huinesoron himself due to her misreading a book of Plort&#39;s history. She is still rather embarrassed about the incident, but has come to reside in Borrd rather nicely.<br><br>Currently, Twyla is a shopkeeper who sells artwork, weapons, travel guides for several Airi-junal Islands, and souvenirs from the District of Eidsaf&#39;twaer in Vidya Gaym, which she visits a lot, especially a castle called Wolfreidi. She is currently in the process of creating a set of weapons and tactical gear for herself, relentlessly improving her combat skills so that one day she can try and apply for knighthood.</i><br><br>-----<br><br>So, here&#39;s a few things I&#39;d like to ask for help with on the backstory:<br>1. Are the new names I had to come up with okay? In case you need clarification, Staar-Wos is Star Wars, Mayen Croft is Minecraft, Tiu Fort is Team Fortress 2, Sti Venkeen is the Stephen King fandom, Sk&#39;ratsh is Scratch.mit.edu (not sure if it should be a part of Weab or So Shall Media, since some folks use it as a substitute for FF.net, but most users think of it as a second DeviantArt), Guugol fluid is Google (the search engine and no other part of it), Eidsaf&#39;twaer is the iD Software fandom, and Wolfreidi is the Wolfenstein 3D (Wolf 3D) fandom. Did I do a good job of naming these things?<br>2. I said above that Twyla caused the existence of various Marizu, but that sounds a bit off. Is there any other way to say the equivalent of &quot;I actually wrote a bunch of bad fanfic when I was younger?&quot;<br>3. I also said that Twyla sells guides to some Airi-junal islands, but that also seems a bit off. Is there any other way to say the equivalent of &quot;I write a lot of original fic?&quot;<br>4. I probably also got a few things about the Plortverse wrong. I was going to do more research and fix them, but I don&#39;t have time to do so right now, so I&#39;m going to post this and let you guys tell me what I did.<br>5. Give me any other tips you have! Tips are greatly appreciated! :D<br><br>-Twistey/Twyla Witherspoon, owner of Twyla&#39;s Odds and Ends</p>

            <p>I have no problem with any of the names. I think it would be good to use the existence of Guggle in your &#39;Guugol fluid&#39; (Guggle fluid?), since, y&#39;know, consistency.<br><br>Sk&#39;ratsh probably isn&#39;t part of the SSM; the Grand Republic of Deeay isn&#39;t, and that&#39;s what you compared it to. :) It may be ripe for conquest by them, though.<br><br>I think the best way to handle the badfic thing would be to accidentally inspire a Marizu warband (or multiple). You can probably straight-up create monsters in Mayen Croft - it&#39;s Vidya Gaym, they have all kinds of strange magics there. But unless you want to directly lead the Marizu into battle (misguidedly, of course), being an unintentional inspiration is probably best.<br><br>I like the idea of the guides! The alternative is building yourself a pocket nation there, but that may be excessive for a simple shopkeeper. Uppa&#39;you.<br><br>I don&#39;t think there&#39;s any issues with the setting. Plort is deliberately a fairly loose creation, to allow for people to easily add to it. (And, for the record, I vaaaaguely remember you doing something, but don&#39;t remember what; don&#39;t let it worry you.)<br><br>Can I craft you some heraldry? Any citizen of Plort is entitled to it. If you don&#39;t feel up to designing a shield, name some symbols you might want and I can work from there.<br><br>hS</p>

<li>Alrighty, that helps. Guggle fluid, haha.<br><br>2. Probably is part of them already. I mean, all the famous Scratchers have DA accounts, came from DA, treat Scratch like it&#39;s DA (hence why there&#39;s constant fighting about recolors, which are allowed on Scratch but aren&#39;t on DA), and all that.<br><br>3. That&#39;d probably work. By &quot;monstrosities&quot;, though, I meant weird and/or Suvian characters, including a Sued version of a friend and a Wither boss with Emperor Palpatine&#39;s face. (Eeeww.) I guess the unintentional inspiration shall be what it is for the rest of them. But what about the whole &quot;didn&#39;t make it to Weab&quot; part? Does that work? I mean, none of my badfic ever got posted online, and even now I don&#39;t have an account on Wattpad, Quotev, FF.net or any of that.<br><br>4. Yay, I had a good idea! Woooo! Maybe I can also add that Twyla has found a love interest in a citizen of one of the islands, just to add more. (Yeah, I&#39;ve declared one of my OCs my boyfriend, since I don&#39;t feel ready to have a real one yet. But I&#39;m making sure not to give him excessive nice things, like other authors are wont to do. In fact, emotional struggle is a huge part of him as a character. But enough about that for now.)<br><br>5. Alrighty, I guess that worked, then! (All I remember doing is commenting on stuff, one of the comments being a question of who Xing is.)<br><br>6. Perhaps something done in gold on a dark green background, since heraldry remains static against a person&#39;s life and therefore I can&#39;t be all Wolfensteiny and I&#39;ve got to look at my less edgy self-inserts for inspiration. (;P) Probably a tree of some sort, with butterflies to the left and right and crossed branches/leaves underneath. I guess. Nature was my thing back in my purest days that I can remember, so try to work with that. <br><br>6b. However, there is the other idea that Twyla gained heraldry upon her entry to Plort and didn&#39;t have it before, in which case, you can make it all Wolfensteiny and impressive. Maybe even a wolf&#39;s face itself, and weapons of some kind somehow involved. Black and red (you can choose the background color between the two), maybe some shiny blueish like all the doors in Wolf 3D are. I can give you some color references if needed.<br><br>6c. I&#39;m overthinking this, aren&#39;t I.<br><br>-Twistey</li>

            <p>The first three parts are already on the <a href="http://plort.wikia.com/wiki/Hieronymus">Plort wiki </a>, but to give newbies an impression of how this is supposed to work, I post them here again, with annotations that are not meant to be part of the chronicle. Also, I’m going to correct mistakes and insert missing links in part three. <br><br>((Part One, published 2014))<br><br>Not much is known about Hieronymus the hermit. He travelled wide and far, looking for a place where to dwell when his livelong journey came near its end. Following rumours about a dreaded plague called the Marizu, and the brave knights who fought this evil, he came to the shores of Wechi. Unseen by anybody, he roamed this vast land for over a year, even sneaking into Arkive and the Hall of Ancient Records. Only when a stranger accused the noble knights of vile malefaction, Hieronymus stepped forward to Borrd to defend their selfless deeds. ((Looking for something to do when I’m retired from my job, reading everything on &quot;The Complete List of PPC Fiction&quot;, lurking and then joining a discussion about what the PPC actually do.)) <br><br>Since then, he has talked to some of the denizens of Plort, and he began to build his home in Wechi, and to prepare his offerings to Kanun and Spelin, for he pondered to explore the mountain range of Purmeshun, but now he seems to be lost in the wood of Kar’eer. How he got there is still a mystery, for he has never been seen in Iric. ((Talking on the board while never chatting in the IRC, creating a wiki user page and thinking about prospective agents and how to get Permission, but not actually doing much, because my job got into the way.)) <br><br>Some may conclude that Hieronymus is a fearsome mage who comes and goes of his own volition, and has not revealed his full power yet, while others may believe that he is a leaf in the wind, never knowing where he may be tomorrow, and both may be right, for being self-contradictory is his very nature.<br><br>((Part Two, published 2015))<br><br>Over time, rumours spread that the hermit may have left the dark woods to walk the roads and pathways of Plort again.<br><br>Inhabitants of Ozerbord remember a grey bearded man who appeared at the Games of Batveg, clad in the habit of a harlequin, pretending to be a veritable knight, but fighting the atrocities in other knight’s tales rather than the misdeeds of the Marizu. Of course this fool was laughed out of town. ((Introducing the &quot;Uncanonical Department of Inaccuracies&quot; in the badfic games.))<br><br>Wordsmiths and Grammagicians at Worhkshap tell tales of a taciturn, grey bearded man wielding a staff – named Androia – in the training sessions for scribe apprentices. Civilians, knights and even barons up and down Plort claim that this very man’s feeble attempts in practising the ancient arts of Beytah may actually have improved their strength.  And nobody shall ever again mention the Quiet Baker-Knight’s weird experience at the Shipfest in a nameless harbour. ((Developing prospective agents Androia and Hieronymus in writing exercises for Poor Cynic’s workshops, beta reading for various PPCers, being shipped in the shipfic fest for &quot;German Pretzels&quot;.))<br><br>It is also said that Hieronymus, on his flight from Ozerbord to Worhkshap, passed an unexplored region at the junction of the Wattuf Mountains and the Mountains of Reverence, where he found the Snow Drops, a moste potente potion that helps curing forgetfulness. How these will be used in the future is yet to be seen. ((Occasionally role-playing an uncanonical Flower – the Snowdrop, Inofficial Department Head of the Uncanonical Department of Inaccuracies – on the board.))<br><br>Recently, the peasants living in the lands between the rivers Wep and Freewep began to talk about a newcomer, fitting the hermit’s description, amongst the workers sent by Baron Neshomeh to help in repairing the damage caused by the last earthquakes. ((Webs.com and freewebs.com continuously delete former PPCers sites for inactivity.))<br><br>The peasants are probably not mistaken, for one day not far in the past, Hieronymus appeared in the Hall of Ancient Records – as he likes to appear out of the blue – and he bent low, and he spoke up and said, ‘Milady Neshomeh, I travelled wide and far. My eyes are old, and my posterior can not stand perpetually riding against the Marizu. But my mind is still sharp, and my hands don’t tremble. If you would assign me a corner in your castle Arkive, where I can rest and store my staff and flask, I could help you copying and restoring these documents I see are in bad shape and may soon disaggregate into dust. And in case I feel ever fit to follow you into battle, I would appreciate the licence to wear your colour on my shield.’<br><br>((Offering to help Neshomeh with archiving &quot;The Lost Tales&quot;, and asking permission to use Neshomeh’s special shade of green on my coat of arms. Also, Hieronymus the hermit asking for a corner to store his still uncanonical &quot;weapons&quot; implies that Hieronymus the boarder, if he ever asks for and gets permission, would like to have Hieronymus the archivist’s apprentice store his stories in the archive of Lost Tales, skipping the step of having them gone lost elsewhere first.))<br><br>((Part Three, published 2016))<br><br>The humble hermits request was met with grace. But rather than finding the rest he had hoped for in that tiny corner at Arkive, the archivist’s new apprentice was immediately sent off to demonstrate and improve his Eich-Tee-Ehm-Ehl skills in the devastated lands. ((Actually working on &quot;The Lost Tales&quot; and the wiki.))<br><br>While Hieronymus was supposed to travel between Arkive and the river Freewep, he somehow became sidetracked to the City of Borrd. He arrived just in time for the annually <a href="http://plort.wikia.com/wiki/2015_Baronial_Council">Baronial Council</a>, where he barely escaped imprisonment and prosecution for treason and libel by Baron Thanasius Ampelius. Had he not conveniently gone lost in the wood of Kar’eer again, Hieronymus would certainly have talked his head off. ((Getting into a dispute about who should govern the new nation &quot;Riding of Sittorese&quot; and chickening out of the role play. Also, my job getting into the way becomes a recurring theme.))<br><br>On his flight from the baron’s ire, the hermit fell into a dubious dungeon. But that is another story and shall be told on another day – actually <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MQ1nC9VEKEzg4FyrZoHUQYYb_R7Iev1DKDwzhjAA3xw/pub"> here</a>, based on <a href="http://huinesoron.webs.com/PPC/BoardDungeon.htm">this</a>,  – but Hieronymus did still not reveal how he got out of this mess again.<br><br>The way through the dungeon may have led to an alternate universe, for Hieronymus clearly remembers that he got out of the forest by following Baron Dann from Castle Tegnoh to La Wunj, where he attended a great festival, apparently held annually to celebrate a victory over the ypurs. His memories of spotting Dame Karrin the Blue and Baron Thanasius Ampelius, and making an awkward attempt to apologize, are much less clear. Before he could hear a response, Hieronymus fell to the floor, very drunken, rolled under a table, started to snore and never spoke another word in Iric. <br><br>((The festival was proposed by the baron formerly known as Techno-Dann on the Baronial Council. I had so hoped for an opportunity to finally put one line into the IRC and give closure to the role-play I had chickened out of, while having an excuse to ignore all further discussion. Alas, it was not meant to be.))<br><br>When he woke up again, all the Ops and Dars of Iric were gone, La Wunj lay mostly abandoned, none of the few citizens Hieronymus still found remembered any recent festivities, and when he asked for Baron Dann, glares and stares were the only answers the hermit got, for everybody knows that south-eastern Plort is and always was ruled by the fair Baroness Delta Juliette. Thus, Hieronymus joined the last trek that left La Wunj to the west, and since he became more invested in the Riding of Sittorese, he travelled on until he reached the Empire of Fanvik-Neht, where he built a <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/u/7551074/">secret hermitage</a> which he hopes will once become a stronghold of goodriding. ((Acknowledging Delta Juliette’s story and the abandoning of the IRC; creating an account on fanfic.net and starting to write &quot;Air&#39;ihpotre&quot; fanfiction that didn’t get much attention yet.))<br><br>How he got across the ocean and then back again, is still one of many mysteries, but although he was supposed to be back on his job of dusting off old scrolls in Arkive, some strange fate took the archivist’s apprentice to the newly assembled Baronial Council again, where he was promptly and retroactively tasked with keeping the records. ((Assuming responsibility for the chronicles of the Baronial Councils.))<br><br>((Part Four, published 2017))<br><br>On his way home from the City of Borrd, Hieronymus the hermit got no further than the Lhawgin Heights, for one evening, when he sat at his campfire [...] strange noise [... ho]oded figure spoke, approaching the old man, [... some(?)] of the Barons talked among us, and [...] agree [...] your journeys through the nations of [...] works in the archives [...] gain [...]understanding of the ways and mores of Pl[ort, ...] dedication to the Riding of Sittorese and the Law of Goodriding. Thus [...] join the ranks of our armies, riding against the Marizu [...]  <br><br>[...] addressed like this, the archivist’s apprentice was so fl[ustered(?) ...] forgot that he had not made proper offers at the temples of Kanun an[d Spelin ...] never wandered the Knights’ Road, and he fell to his knees, and he felt a sword touch his should[er(?) ...] became a knight of Plort without much of the pomp and cere[mony(?) ...us]ually involved.    <br><br>[Archivist’s note: The end of the scroll looks like it was ripped by talons and singed by flames. As far as can be determined from other sources, Hieronymus the hermit did not return to Arkive before the next Baronial Council was held, but he may have shown up when Baron Iximaz gathered an Army for a campaign to the Bronee.]  <br><br>((Getting Permission, participating in a Role Play that became part of Iximaz’s <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qsE0Hvs6D1solpkkIrRzvQRUGLaqB8nB5T5x3Zv0NsY/edit">&quot;Neverfree From Working&quot;</a>)).<br><br>((I don’t know yet whether there will be another scroll. Keeping the tune is hard, I obviously didn’t do much worth mentioning since I got Permission, and there is not much left that would be mentionable just for me doing it for the first time. So, this may be a good point to let this tale end.))<br><br>HG</p>

            <p>The doors of Otik creak open. As the rail lashes at the flagstones, Baron Huinesoron walks slowly into the council chamber. He walks with a cane, one leg trailing limply behind him, but his back is straight and his head held high.<br><br>He does not look at the gathered barons, knights, and civilians. He crosses the wide floor in silence, coming at last to a stop in front of the grand map of Plort carved into the wall. From his pocket he draws a stylus, pulsing with red light.<br><br>&quot;We&#39;ve been through some troubling times lately,&quot; he says. A ripple runs through the crowd as they hear the cracking in his voice, the strain weighing on every syllable, but the baron does not look round. He raises the stylus, and its lambent glow cuts into the stonework like clay.<br><br>&quot;The war…&quot; Huinesoron shakes his head. &quot;Was it even a war?&quot; His hand moves over the Forest of Kar&#39;eer, dust falling as the rain where it passes. &quot;The Mords of the discord say their lands are bountiful and cultured. They say the western lands pleaded to join with them, to live under their enlightened rule.&quot; He walks down the length of the map, his cane tapping on the stone, and presses his palm over the city Ozerbord. &quot;They say that when their airships landed at Skypcht, they were welcomed with open arms.<br><br>&quot;I have my doubts.&quot; The stylus sweeps across the Geymez Plateau, obliterating the name of Ozerbord, and inscribing a new one in its place. &quot;But I will not fight. Geymez, as La Wunj, belongs to the discord.&quot;<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/vaP18r4.png"><br><br>He steps back and looks up, his gaze taking in the northern Spalchik Lowlands, where the city of Teebor and the castle Kwenaya gleam as twin jewels. &quot;The Refuge stands empty,&quot; he says. &quot;Oh, it draws the crowds from time to time, when peril strikes or the old festivals resume, but none live there.&quot; He stretches up and plucks the green gem of Kwenaya from the map. &quot;It has no need of a baron,&quot; he says softly.<br><br>The stylus flickers to life anew, its light shading to a deep blue. &quot;I relinquish the barony of what was once Ozerbord,&quot; Huinesoron says, tracing glowing lines across the map. &quot;Let what remains of the Refuge stand without the baron it no longer needs, and let the Lady Iximaz take up her place as warden of the new discord in the west. By the Edict of Bast, those lands once held by Baron Thanasius Ampelius also pass to her; the lands beyond the mountains are united once more.&quot;<br><br>He steps back. The whole chamber seems to hold its breath as he studies the map, and then he makes his slow, steady way down to the line of the Larninkurvs.<br><br>&quot;Barony July,&quot; he says, and a sigh drifts through the air. &quot;Barony Ampelius. Barony Cassie. Barony Araeph.&quot; The baron lifts his stylus again, and green fire gathers about its tip. &quot;All stand empty, in the heart of Borrd and the Riding. This cannot be.&quot;<br><br>Under his pen a new pattern of baronies takes shape. &quot;I will take Barony Araeph as my own,&quot; Huinesoron says, plucking the amber jewel of Araeph&#39;s castle and pressing his own garnet into its place. &quot;I will reclaim Retben from its ruins and build a new keep in its place. And I will take also Barony July, ceding back its southern tip to Barons Neshomeh and Juliette.<br><br>&quot;But,&quot; and with a sudden stroke he inscribes a circle around the city of Borrd itself, &quot;I will not claim baronial authority over this city. I ask that the Council of Borrd be jointly trusted with that duty, as has been proposed on many previous occasions.&quot;<br><br>He pauses for a moment, bowing his head. Then he reaches up and carves a new hole into the map, on the banks of the river Meibot. &quot;We have welcomed Baron Eshakhar into our midst,&quot; he says, pulling a carved rose quartz from his pocket and clicking it into place. &quot;Let Baronies Ampelius and Cassie be hers to watch and to ward, to lead into battle and to lead in time of peace.&quot;<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/afzZ4wg.png"><br><br>Baron Huinesoron turns at last, facing the Council. His face is pale and drawn as he looks out at them, and in his outstretched hand he holds the four gemstones he has plucked from the map: amber for Araeph, topaz for Thanasius Ampelius, turquoise for July, and jasper for Cassie.<br><br>&quot;We&#39;ve been through some troubling times lately,&quot; he says again. &quot;This island fortress has-&quot; He pauses, wincing, and leans heavily on his cane before speaking again. &quot;Has been shaken. But it has not fallen.&quot;<br><br>Huinesoron straightens up again, and a fiery spark seems to burn in his eyes. &quot;And it will not fall,&quot; he declares. &quot;Not while any one of us draws breath. This is the Union of Plort - the legacy of Jay and Acacia - and it. Will. Not. Fall.<br><br>&quot;We must draw together, now more than ever. To that end-&quot; He stops again, draws a deep breath. &quot;To that end, I propose that this Baronial Council be expanded to include not only our military leaders, but also those who guide the fo- <i>five</i> nations of Konti-Nyuum.&quot; He looks across the crowd, noting faces and absences. &quot;Let the archivists of Wechi send their representatives, and the Beytahs of the Riding. Let,&quot; a wince crosses his face, &quot;Protector Tomash of Ozerbord sit in council, and…&quot; The baron closes his eyes, clutching the gemstones in an involuntary fist. &quot;And let the Mords of the discord be seated among us, that together we may debate and decide what is best for the Union of Plort.&quot;<br><br><hr>
<br><br>The national borders and the shut-down baronies aren&#39;t really open for dispute. The Discord has taken over most of the RPing that used to be done on T-Board, so it gets the land to go with it. The relocation of Barony Huinesoron, boundaries of Barony Eshakhar, expansions of baronies Iximaz, Neshomeh, and Juliette, status of Borrd, and the expansion of the Council of Plort (<i>not</i> the Council of Borrd, which remains just barons - Iximaz, Phobos, PC, Huinesoron, Kaitlyn, and Eshakhar by the above maps), are all up for debate.<br><br>Oh, and in keeping with the theme established a while back, the colour of baronies on the map/the gemstones used for their castles is what you get if you plug their names into &lt;font color=&quot;this spot&quot;&gt;. Since &#39;Zingenmir&#39; is identical to &#39;Huinesoron&#39;, you get Eshakhar.<br><br>Iximaz - Sapphire<br>Phobos - Obsidian<br>PoorCynic - Jade<br>Neshomeh - Lapiz Lazuli<br>Huinesoron - Garnet<br>Kaitlyn - Ruby<br>Eshakhar - Rose Quartz<br>Juliette - Amythest<br>VixenMage - Turquoise<br><br>And someone please give the Discord a proper name! Baron Me has been using the descriptive word &#39;discord&#39;, but I doubt you want to just stick with that. (If you feel like making a flag for it - or if anyone wants to throw in a flag for the Riding of Sittorese - that would be delightful.)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>((Keeping track has been quite easy so far. I desperately need more input!)) <br><br>This Baronial Council was held from the twelfth of July until the fourteenth of July in the City of Borrd.<br><br><b>Attendees:</b> ((so far))<br>Baron Huinesoron<br>Baron Kaitlyn was present, but did not say a word.<br><br>Non-deciding attendees:<br>Knight Ælcalen, mayor of L&#39;Urque<br>Frackles, messenger of Kwenaya<br>Sir Hieronymus the hermit, keeper of the records<br>((Ye Scape-Grace may have been there to present the new nation’s flag, but the keeper of the records did not actually see this happen))<br><br><b>Agenda:</b><br>A change of the rules of procedure – a proposal by Baron Huinesoron to let the archivists of the Commonwealth of Wechi, the Beytahs of the Riding of Sittorese, Protector Tomash of Ozerbord and the Mords of the discord participate in the Baronial Council as <i>voting</i> representatives of their respective nations.<br><br>A new nation – the Council is asked to acknowledge the establishment of a fifth nation, referred to as The People’s Republic of Discord, which took possession of lands in the far east around La Wunj and in the west on the Geymez Plateau.((I’m mean. If you don’t want to be a People’s Republic, somebody must stand up and say so.))<br><br>A new barony – per an invocation of the Edict of Bast, the newly created Baron Eshakhar receives the lands previously held by the permanently absent Baron Cassie, including the part that has last year been ceded to the now permanently absent Baron Thanasius Ampelius. ((I guess we don’t really want to have this proposed and decided by Baron Huinesoron, the historian just channeled his knowledge of how the Edict of Bast works.))<br><br>The relocation of Barony Huinesoron – a proposal by Baron Huinesoron to let him take the lands previously held by the permanently absent barons Araeph and July, but cede the territories south of the River Meibot back to Baron Neshomeh (west of the Auriantym Chain) respective Baron Juliette (east of the Auriantym Chain), making Neshomeh the only baron in Wechi again.<br><br>The disposition of Baron Huinesoron’s western territories – since Baron Huinesoron moves to eastern Borrd and the Riding of Sittorese, he intends to leave what is left of Ozerbord without a baron, but to cede his lands between the River Wep and the Wattuf Mountains, and the Geymez Plateau to Lady Iximaz, who, by another invocation of the Edict of Bast, would also receive the western part of former Barony Thanasius Ampelius. ((What can we do if we don’t want to throw these lands on Iximaz, whether she likes it or not? Can Baron Huinesoron be forced to keep them and hold a split barony, like Thanasius Ampelius did last year? Do we really want him holding all these lands?))<br><br>The status of the City of Borrd – a move by Baron Huinesoron to exclude the capital from his new barony and let the Council of Borrd jointly take baronial authority over this city, as has been proposed on many previous occasions.<br><br>The Warden of Spelin – a move by Baron Huinesoron to appoint Ye Scape-Grace of De&#39;endee as the warden of the Temple of Spelin. <br><br>((New flags – I don’t think that the council has to decide about that. The new nations may have used the opportunity to present their flags to a greater public, but since no resident of the Riding of Sittorese showed up, and Scapegrace did not post in-character as Ye Scape-Grace, I don’t know if and how this happened.<br><br>The council may still decide to create a new version of the Union flag that includes all five nations, but I need in-universe input to make this have happened, and we may not want this to be another proposal made by Baron Huinesoron, although he may be tasked with creating the flag.))<br><br><b>Decisions:</b><br>Since the keeper of the records refused to write down rules that still need clarification, no decision concerning the expansion of the Council was recorded and no non-baron attempted to vote.<br><br>A new nation – acknowledged by a vote of one to zero.<br><br>A new barony – acknowledged by a vote of one to zero.<br><br>The relocation of Barony Huinesoron – decided as proposed by a vote of one to zero.<br><br>The disposition of Baron Huinesoron’s western territories – decided as proposed by a vote of one to zero.<br><br>The status of the City of Borrd – decided as proposed by a vote of one to zero.<br><br>The Warden of Spelin – decided as proposed by a vote of one to zero.<br><br>((I guess we don’t really want this to happen. If there is no opposition, I would at least like to see some barons voice their agreement, so that they can appear on the list of attendees. <br><br>Also, everybody who is not a baron can still request to be put on the list of non-deciding attendees, because you may have been there to watch the events, even if you didn’t say a word. Just reply here with your Plort name.<br><br>HG))</p>

            <p>It had been less noticable in the first hour: broken by Ye Scape-Grace&#39;s presentation of the flag of the Discord, and Baron Huinesoron&#39;s intervention; broken by Hieronymus&#39; proposed flag of the Riding, and his unanswered soliloquy on voting law; broken by messengers from Barons Iximaz and Eshakhar. But now the second hour had rolled around, and in place of lively debate, stillness blanketed the hall of Otik.<br><br>Huinesoron looked up from a whispered conversation with his wife. &quot;Is there no business?&quot; he asked into the quiet. &quot;Is there no argument - nothing to say at all?&quot;<br><br>He got to his feet and walked out into the centre of the chamber. The great seats around him were mired in gloom, the figures enthroned upon them barely visible beneath the backlit banners of their heraldic arms.<br><br>&quot;Baron Phobos,&quot; Huinesoron said, facing the shield of the  Dice and Daggers. &quot;Have you no words? Long have you argued concerning the division of Barony Araeph - will you now let the matter pass unnoticed? And Baron PC,&quot; he turned to the Apple and Axe, &quot;will you not speak for Ozerb- for the western discord? If Lady Iximaz spurns the rule, will you not step into her place?&quot;<br><br>Silence, deep and thick. The baron let out a cry of distress and span, striding across the stone flags towards the banner of the Fox of VixenMage. &quot;Someone in this grand council must have an opinion! If not, why have you come here at all?&quot;<br><br>He passed into the shadows surrounding the tall chair. A moment later, a startled shout echoed through the chamber, and something mint-green fluttered out of the darkness to land in the centre of the pool of light.<br><br>Baron Huinesoron followed, bearing with him an upright stave resting on a wooden base. He crossed to the crumpled pool of cloth and retrieved it, hanging it on the wooden assemblage. The cloak billowed down; in the shadows, it would have looked just like a seated figure.<br><br>Huinesoron turned slowly on his heel. The banners above him were still; the torches flickered softly on the walls; no movement came from any of the chairs.<br><br>&quot;In the name of Kanun and Spelin,&quot; he whispered, clearly audible in the silence, &quot;is there anyone else here at all?&quot;<br><br>((^_^ And yes, that&#39;s confirmation that both flag proposals happened in-universe. ~hS))</p>

            <p>I assume the two different blues are deliberate.

            <p>The two different blues are indeed deliberate; so are the two wider grey bars.

            <p>... in one of the <i>Doctor Who Unbound</i> audio books (they&#39;re AUs, and actually pretty awesome), that Time Lords will switch sex if they regenerate due to committing suicide. (The one I&#39;m thinking of is <a href="http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Exile_(audio_story)">Exile</a>, the first full-length story to feature a female Doctor. She is probably an AU Three, having escaped from Time Lord justice presumably as Two.)<br><br>Well, so far that pretty much holds up. The two sex-change regenerations we&#39;ve seen are the General standing in front of the Doctor&#39;s gun even when he&#39;s checking whether (s)he&#39;ll regenerate, and the Master literally stabbing him/herself in the back (assuming Simms did in fact regenerate directly into Missy).<br><br>Assuming this is part of the ongoing regeneration from the finale... well, he did trap himself on a deck full of Cybermen and walk in front of their guns while planning to blow the whole place to smithereens. It&#39;s not hard to call that suicide, too.<br><br>(Of course, if you do that, the Doctor practically always commits suicide...)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Okay; I&#39;m sorry for drawing a connection between the current announcement and a past piece of Doctor Who fiction that you don&#39;t find amusing.<br><br>I believe the /other/ regeneration to female was after being shot by a Dalek, in Curse of the Fatal Death.

            <p>This is for multiple reasons. Most of them are below, and are because this audio includes:<br><br>- The Doctor drinking and vomiting (with very realistic sound effects)<br>- Major transphobia, including some voiced by David Tennant<br>- A very loose plot revolving explosive gasses from human waste in the car park at the store the Doctor works in<br>- David Tennant eating dog food<br>- Frequent discussion of poo<br>- Yet more transphobia<br>- Seriously, here’s a quote from it: “Doctor, you have been found guilty of crimes against the laws of time and Time Lord decency. You stole a TARDIS and interfered in the affairs of others, but worst of all, you had a sex-change regeneration.”<br><br>it&#39;s.... really not good. I&#39;d prefer not to ever think about its existence, let alone take the &#39;Time Lords committing suicide&#39; part as canon. <br><br>(not trying to start a fight btw, just putting all of this out here)</p>

            <p><i>Everything is canon</i>. :D No, seriously, that&#39;s the premise of the Tardis Wikia: everything is valid to some extent.<br><br>Obviously <i>DWU: Exile</i> takes place in a weird side universe, but that doesn&#39;t mean its physical laws are invalid. (Also it amuses me that it&#39;s yet another story with &#39;future Doctor actor plays a Time Lord who beats up the Doctor&#39; - <a href="http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Arc_of_Infinity_(TV_story)">hi, Colin Baker</a>!)<br><br>But yes. I&#39;ve only listened to the <i>Unbound</i> stories once each, so while I recommend the concept, I can&#39;t really comment on the quality. And no, it&#39;s absolutely not something that&#39;s going to be held up/looked to as canon.<br><br>(In fact, <i>Unbound</i> has already been explicitly made uncanon at least once - the one where the Doctor gets shot immediately after regenerating, and thus regenerates again. Um, no - depending on how it&#39;s done, that would either cause the regeneration to fail, or cause a River Song-esque light show. It certainly wouldn&#39;t cause a second regeneration.)<br><br>But it&#39;s still an amusing idea. And maybe Time Lord Tennant is just... not a very nice person? (In fact... pretty sure he isn&#39;t, thinking about that story.)<br><br>hS</p>

I hope I had not antagonised anyone during my leave. if so, I deeply regret it and asked for your sincere forgiveness. I have been writing a new fanfic very recently, since I was smitten by Kuroko no Basuke and for some reason, decided to crossover it with Mount and Blade. it has graphic violence though, so I will be not be sharing it here.<br><br>Lastly, Hello again!</p>

<li>The original spear is an occult artifact that one can use to summon demons, but is better off safely stored in the iD Software &#39;verse than in the hands of any Boarder. Thus, the replica is just a decorative item you can display in your virtual self&#39;s room to impress people. Just make sure you label somewhere that it&#39;s only a replica, otherwise the iDSoftware!US Government will be after you because they&#39;ll think you stole the original, and the only people who have ever stolen the original Spear of Destiny before are the iDSoftware!Nazis.<br><br>2. Cool! Worldbuilding is always nice. Ahaha, I too have my own writing tropes... most of them are essentially the constant aversion of a friend&#39;s tropes, because my friend&#39;s tropes are pretty annoying, especially if one has been analyzing her work for as long as I have. T_T<br><br>3. Thanks for the replica Silmarils. I should probably read the Silmarillion once I&#39;m done with Return of the King, to figure out what action of the original Silmarils is replicated by the batteries in these. But anyway, thanks!<br><br>-Twistey</li>

            <p>I am just not into visual novels. As for the nonexistent anime, I haven&#39;t the time to watch it yet. I had other obligations. This is the reason only now am I able to return to fanfic writing.<br><br>Nasuverse has the same problem I had with Tolkienverse. It&#39;s hard to build upon a world where its main attraction, in this magic, is leaving it. It may be an interesting exercise, but it hurts my heart. I prefer the AWoIaF, but as fanfiction isn;t permitted by the author, all we could legally do is to raise madder and madder fan theories regarding things. You should look at r/asoiaf, only recently their madness had lessened, by a bit.</p>

            <p>It is technically called &quot;outside the world&quot; but there is a slight technicality here. The root is the source of all souls, all phenomena, it is everything and nothing at the same time. Everything because it is the source of all things and where everything will return to. Nothing because, well, everything that exists came from a blank slate, a state of nothingness. To touch the root is to recieve knowledge of everything and essentially become god. At the same time, touching the root &quot;returns your soul to whence it came&quot; thus causing one&#39;s death. So a person will become god, but will cease to be a person; his or her very concept will be altered by the experience.  The first and fifth magics draw directly from the root, the second, third, and fourth magics are means to reach the root. Some people such as Void Shiki have an intrinsic connection to the root.<br><br>As a side note, it would be very difficult to PPC Nasuverse fanfic because of how the world works, unless DoSAT has got something to circumvent that.</p>

            <p>Yes magecraft is getting weaker as humanity grows stronger. However this does not actually affect magic as the phantasmal species that are governed by mystery simply moved to the reverse side of the world. It is only humanity that has lost touch with magecraft and mystery due to Alaya-shiki&#39;s interference with the laws of Gaia&#39;s reality marble. Species that are not human such as those connected to Gaia (i.e. True Ancestors) still have a hight level of mystery. At least until Angel Notes and/or Tsuki no Sango happened, but these two events happen only in some timelines.</p>

            <p>Okay, pardon, but I&#39;ll need to get some clarification here and there, if you don&#39;t mind. <br><br>so, <i>what</i> do you intend on using your gore for? <br><br>You want to use it as a technique through which you can criticise immortality? How so? I can&#39;t see how the experience of gore (and, therefore, the experience of seeing yourself get injured and all,) works to subvert and criticise the concept of immortality - surely an immortal would, by a certain point, have learnt to get over all the icky things that happen when they die and then promptly un-die? I mean, the general idea is that gore is feared because it&#39;s a <i>reminder</i> of mortality - the fact that we&#39;re all a bunch of squelching biological machines that could just shut down at any moment like any other machine. This is a fear that is irrelevant to an immortal, hence the name! <br><br>What is your point about video games? Is it that people try not getting killed because they want to avoid gore? I mean, I doubt it&#39;s that point - plenty of videogames lack gore and you don&#39;t want to die in them! Not-dying in videogames is more easily attributed to the whole &#39;I want to win and not lose&#39; mindset. But, yes, I&#39;m not sure what your point there is, pardon. <br><br>What do you intend to show by &#39;describing in graphic detail how it (presumably the gore) hurts the character physically and mentally&#39;? Does this relate to your earlier mention of wanting to criticise immortality? <br><br>Also, surely the lack of death in Mount and Blade is more of a game mechanic, than a function of the game&#39;s canon and worldbuilding? Surely death exists within the plot, and world and all, the plot and world and all being the things relevant to fanfic, over the game mechanics, oy? <br><br>I disagree with the notion that tragedy <i>requires</i> gore, because that is a nonsense notion. It is a tragedy when a young boy grows up without a father figure because his dad&#39;s passed away from diabetes type-two, and it hardly <i>stops</i> being tragic by not having any gore about! Or did you mean something else with that point? <br><br>Your last sentence lost me completely. I&#39;m not sure what gore has to do with a character atoning for crime in the eyes of their mates if they become a bandit. <br><br>Yes, ah, pardon for the barrage of questions. Clarification&#39;d be helpful in getting <i>your</i> question, y&#39;know? </p>

            <p>Well gore can be used to torture an immortal using methods that would kill a normal person. And if one could keep the immortal restrained, said gore would last forever.

            <p>that&#39;s just the experience of pain and misery. Which can, and is frequently associated with gore, but is not <i>inherently</i> tied to gore.

            <p>But remember, in addition to hurting the character, it should also appeal to the reader, for whom gore greatly increases the squick factor and the percieved pain. A writer can describe pain and misery and the reader would sympathize, however they may not be able to understand how bad it is because some of these methods are just so out there. Add a dose of gore and the reader instantly goes, &quot;I DO NOT WANT THAT TO HAPPEN TO ME!!!!!&quot; because gore is assiciated with pain and the amount of pain is related to the level of gore.<br><br>Yes, what I mentioned can be done without gore, and gore may not affect the immortal. However, gore affects the reader, and the reader&#39;s reaction is as much part of the story as the reaction of a character. Therefore, some things may not be necessary from a character standpoint, but can be added to the story to elicit emotions from the reader to deliver a larger impact. </p>

Think of how the characters think, or how a gamer might percieve enemies in a game. One would not notice a mook or redshirt that got killed by the protagonist. In such cases, a simple phrase describing the death should suffice because no one, not even the one performing the killing, cares about it. On the other hand, if this was a final battle of ultimate destiny against a nemesis, or a boss fight, or anything of emotional significance, then the character begins to notice details. <br>Adding details of the act will add emotional significance to the killing, or hurting, of a character. Basically, it is the difference between &quot;seeing&quot; and &quot;feeling&quot; the violence. So, if the violence is not significant to the characters and plot i.e. hurting a mook, then intricate details should be used less. If it is significant, then more details could, and should, be added. If it is very emotionally significant, then you may do tiny details of you so choose. Although this is my own personal views.<br><br>And yes, gore can be used to point out weaknesses of immortality. In fact, this was done in baccano.</p>

            <p>Aaah, I&#39;ve always hated the concept of some deaths inherently meaning &#39;less&#39; than others (which then, naturally, leads into the concept of other <i>lives</i> inherently meaning less than others.) It&#39;s an ugly, worrying, and rather dystopian concept to me. But, to be fair, I can&#39;t say I&#39;m particularly fond of works in which the protagonists kill swathes of sapient people and not feel a thing about it! <br><br>Although, yes, you do add a very good point - the point of <i>emphasis</i>. Putting more detail in order to show us that, well, this bit&#39;s important! That is a very good point, indeed. Even in cases where the gore doesn&#39;t seem particularly over the top, the impact of the situation can be increased by the detail of it, like, say, someone getting nicked by a knife they <i>know</i> is poisoned, or a character that&#39;s been sheltered and never been injured getting injured and being utterly shocked by it. That sort&#39;ve stuff. <br><br>Gore is, as with everything else that gets put into writing, a technique, and it really can be used to great effect in the right places. As long as it feels like it has a genuine purpose and its presence and appearance doesn&#39;t &#39;overstay that purpose,&#39; as it were, and make it feel unnecessary and weird, gore seems perfectly fine. <br>I think that&#39;s the main issue with gore, over other particular writing techniques - the fact that, given its inherently visceral and sort of ugly nature, you just need to be more careful balancing it, so it doesn&#39;t overstay its purpose and feel all icky. </p>

            <p>And about the lesser life thing, unfortunately it also occurs in real life. Therefore, it is perfectly reasonable for some lives to mean less to specific characters. Since most pieces of fiction are writting partially from the protaginist&#39;s perspective, naturally some lives look cheap because they are, from the protagonist&#39;s perspective at least. In the grand scheme of things, all lives are equal. From the perspctive of an individual, definitely not.</p>

Romero, father of the modern movie zombie and creator of the groundbreaking “Night of the Living Dead” franchise, has died at 77.<br><br>Romero died Sunday in his sleep after a “brief but aggressive battle with lung cancer,” according to a statement to The Times provided by his longtime producing partner, Peter Grunwald. Romero died while listening to the score of one his favorite films, 1952’s “The Quiet Man,” with his wife, Suzanne Desrocher Romero, and daughter, Tina Romero, at his side, the family said.<br><br>Romero jump-started the zombie genre as the co-writer (with John A. Russo) and director of the 1968 movie “Night of the Living Dead,” which went to show future generations of filmmakers such as Tobe Hooper and John Carpenter that generating big scares didn’t require big budgets. “Living Dead” spawned an entire school of zombie knockoffs, and Romero’s sequels included 1978’s “Dawn of the Dead,” 1985’s “Day of the Dead,” 2005’s “Land of the Dead,” 2007’s “Diary of the Dead” and 2009’s “George A. Romero’s Survival of the Dead.”<br><br>The original film, since colorized, has become a Halloween TV staple. Among other notable aspects of the cult classic was the casting of a black actor, Duane Jones, in the lead role, marking a milestone in the horror genre.</i></p>

            <p>This is another thing I worked on while I was gone, and it&#39;s... odd. If you read xkcd, you might recall <a href="https://xkcd.com/1017/">this comic</a>, about making &#39;an extreme sport out of waiting&#39; by calculating the relationship between the amount of time past and the history of the Earth.<br><br>Well, I <i>do</i> remember it... and I decided to do it.<br><br><a href="http://huinesoron.webs.com/ExtremeWaiting.html">Extreme Waiting</a> is a JavaScript implementation of the idea. It comes with three prebuilt timelines (I prefer to go forwards, rather than backwards): the History of the Earth, the History of Writing, and (of course) the History of Middle-earth.<br><br>They&#39;re all exponential curves, so time gets more spaced-out as you approach zero; I have jigged the exponents to get roughly even information density across the timeline, though.<br><br>You can also write your own timeline and paste it in the box - just follow the example of the samples (&#39;@10.05 Event here&#39;, with a space after the percentage). If you do, you can share them here - I might even implement them with their own pictures!<br><br>(It works on Chrome and IE; let me know if there&#39;s a problem on your browser.

It&#39;ll be interesting to see where this goes<br>- Showing canon being back to normal at the end like that is good<br><br>General review:<br>This was rather good overall, and there were a bunch of funny and clever bits. However, one complaint I have is that it feels like there should be a tiny bit more mission in the mission (snark, the occasional badfic quote, etc.). I didn&#39;t get as good a sense of the fic as I usually do, even though I&#39;ve still figured out generally why it&#39;s bad.<br><br>Speaking of subjective complains, it seems like the &quot;I just found out I&#39;m pregnant&quot; bit could use a bit more narrative weight. That seems like a really important event in the story, but it doesn&#39;t even get a paragraph to itself, or much description at all. Makes the revelation a bit underwhelming (unless it wasn&#39;t meant to be a revelation, and was supposed to be a normal-ish thing, in which case ignore this comment)<br><br>- Tomash</p>
