            <p>Don&#39;t worry, the Chicago crowd was reassuringly large. It was a very relaxed atmosphere, though. There was some chanting, but in sporadic pockets. The march ended at Museum Campus, where there&#39;s the Adler Planetarium, the Shedd Aquarium, and the Field Museum of Natural History, and there was a science expo behind the museum, too. The crowd sort of mysteriously dissolved, and I suspect it&#39;s because we all went &quot;ooh, science!&quot; and wandered off to the various attractions. I&#39;m not <i>too</i> sure about how that reflects our commitment, but it was fun, and it was visible! There were helicopters overhead, watching. I saw people wave at them sometimes. I did, too.<br><br>I took some pictures, but the only one with me in it was taken by a choir-friend of mine and also includes her grandkids, so I dunno about sharing. I got a few interesting things on my cell phone, though. I&#39;ll put them in a folder in my <a href="http://smg.photobucket.com/user/Neshomeh/library/">my Photobucket</a>, assuming my computer decides to acknowledge my cell phone&#39;s existence any time soon.<br><br>As always, hS, your family is adorable, and those signs are great. ^_^ Gotta ask, what is that hair style you&#39;re sporting? It looks partly buzzed underneath... or am I seeing things?<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>... they <i>started</i> at the Science Museum, and let everyone get it out of their systems.

            <p>Howdy Boarders past and present!<br><br>It&#39;s been about 6 months since I&#39;ve even checked the Board, but idly had a whim to pop back in here and say hi!<br><br>What&#39;s news? From front page posts, I see something about me officially being ancient now? (Also possibly a shadowy Cabal of 5 underneath Tsarina Kaitlyn, but I&#39;m not at liberty to discuss that.)<br><br>In recent Elcalion news, I&#39;ve been doing quite a lot of travelling, including a trip to Europe for a conference a month or two ago, and am already up to 60,000km of air travel this year, and heartily sick of the inside of a plane. I have also been working for 10 years full time now (at the same company too) which is a scary thought, but is offset by long service leave*, so I&#39;m planning yet more travel.<br><br>... I should really get around to finishing my third mission, seeing as it&#39;s been (*checks watch*) seven years since I&#39;ve completed one.<br><br>Anyway, celebratory profiteroles and Bleeprum for everyone!<br><br>Elcalion, returnatory<br><br>*For those of you not in Australia/New Zealand, long service leave is a throwback to the 19th century where it took months to travel back to the UK (the &quot;home country&quot;) and so employees got extended period of leave to travel back home once every 10 years. It still survives, but now just means if you stay with the same employer for 10 years you get 2.5 months of paid holiday as a one-off bonus.</p>

            <p>Rudi's was already abuzz when Dafydd climbed up onto the stage and slapped his hand on the wall.

<p>"These Games have been an emotional rollercoaster that have had all of us in HQ glued to our seats - in some cases literally; it's that sort of place. But in the end, there could only be one winner.</p>

<p>"Agent Levy! On behalf of the team at Nutmeg TV, who couldn't be here for," the elf glanced across at Richard Legard, "ah, unspecified reasons, I'm delighted to present you with this year's trophy. To commemorate your victory: the Golden Electric Bookshelf!"</p>

            <p>(I guess spoilers for, uh, everything?)<br><br>So I&#39;m rereading the Discworld series, and it sprung out at me that there are a <i>lot</i> of semi-sentient hats on the Disc.<br><br>The big two are the Archchancellor&#39;s Hat and the crown of Lancre, both of which are explicitly imbued with some of the personality of their previous bearers (the AC&#39;s Hat talks and all). But what about Rincewind&#39;s hat, which snaps him back to himself in an instant in <i>Interesting Times</i>? Or the Opera Ghost&#39;s mask, which has a similar effect?<br><br>Even right down to the end of the series, Pterry kept up the hat symbolism. <i>The Shepherd&#39;s Crown</i> features, apart from its titular talisman, Tiffany being &#39;crowned&#39; by a halo of bees at one point. So I guess, really, this leads to three big questions:<br><br>1/ Are there any other explicitly-imbued hats lying around on the Disc, other than the AC&#39;s and that crown? I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if there were.<br><br>2/ What happens to Granny&#39;s hat? Does it go to Tiffany? Because if there&#39;s anyone who&#39;d accidentally invest their headgear with part of their personality...<br><br>3/ In light of all this, do you think anyone has dared try <i>Pterry&#39;s</i> hat on since his death...?<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>1/ Who cares? The whole <i>point</i> of the Discworld is that it isn&#39;t a fantasy about talking hats or magic swords or worlds that fly through space on the back of a turtle. It&#39;s about people, and who they are, and what they think. Not whether or not they can hold a two-way conversation with their own headgear (one-way conversations, of course, being much easier).<br><br>2/ This is answered at the end of <i>The Wee Free Men</i>, at least allegorically. Granny talks about Granny Aching making the sky her hat and the wind her coat; for me, this was an allegory for how pointy hats might be nice and distinctive, but what matters is the witch underneath. Granny Weatherwax was one of the best. Tiff Aching will be too. Neither of them needed Granny&#39;s hat to be so.<br><br>3/ Neil Gaiman was presented with it at Pterry&#39;s funeral, so if anyone has, it&#39;s him. Or his slightly irritating wife. Or possibly a pet, which is the kind of thing I think the dear departed would get behind.</p>

            <p>Ironically, Granny Weatherwax&#39;s hat might best serve as an antagonist, if you were absolutely hell-bent on having a talking hat as a character. Pterry&#39;s later works, as might be expected given the embuggerance, were heavily about passing the torch (Moist von Lipwig is being groomed for the Patricianship and nobody shall convince me otherwise); Granny Weatherwax&#39;s talking hat is a symbol of clinging to the past, wishing it was still her knocking about and not this Tiffany Whatshername girl. Especially if it became a symbol for the old ways amongst more reactionary crowds in witchcraft; of mindless subservience to tradition rather than respect for it. It&#39;d almost be as bad as Mrs. Earwig&#39;s lot, though from the other way...</p>

            <p><i>Concilliary: (noun) &#39;A conclave intended to bring a community back together&#39;. New coinage based on <u>conciliar</u> (&#39;relating to a council&#39;), &#39;conciliatory&#39; (&#39;intended to pacify or soothe&#39;), and &#39;reconcile&#39; (&#39;come back together&#39;).</i><br><br>A month ago, events showed that there were deep rifts in the PPC community. Two long-time members left; three others have told me they want to; several more have gone very quiet. This cannot go on.<br><br>I asked everyone who felt there were past events or behaviour hanging over the community to email me in confidence and tell me what the problems were. I promised I would compile the whole lot of them and bring them to the Board for discussion. Well - here I am.<br><br>I&#39;m taking the advice VixenMage gave last month, and starting out this process by looking at <b>behaviours</b>, not individuals. For pretty much every item I list, I could name at least two people who have been brought up in connection with them, so no, there are no &#39;veiled attack on Person Z&#39; items here.<br><br>The issues are broken up (fairly arbitrarily) into four categories/subthreads; you don&#39;t have to reply to them all, but you should really at least think about all of them. I&#39;ll also make a &#39;general comments&#39; subthread for anything that doesn&#39;t fit under one of the four; please try to keep everything in a subthread, to make things fractionally easier to navigate.<br><br>I&#39;m presenting the problems in varying formats, without much effort at consistency, but I think for all of them we need to be thinking about the same set of questions:<br><br>-Is this behaviour the PPC should condemn? Is it a potential banning issue?<br>-Where it has happened in the past and gone unresolved, do we need to require apologies/bans for the perpetrators? How long after the incident is this reasonable?<br>-What should you, as an individual, do if you see or suspect this behaviour in the future?<br><br>A few ground rules:<br><br>-The PPC Constitution is in full force during this conversation, as in every other conversation in the PPC community.<br>-Please do not discuss this thread on the Discord. Having portions of the discussion &#39;off the record&#39; is directly contrary to the purpose of the Concilliary.<br>-Everybody&#39;s opinion is welcome.<br>-When it looks like things are settling down, I will do my best to summarise the consensus on each of the points, and we&#39;ll proceed from there. At that point, depending on the outcome of the discussion, we may discuss individual incidents and people.<br>-Please don&#39;t wander off and abandon the discussion. It&#39;s important. Yes, it&#39;s going to be tiring hashing this all out, but I really believe it will lead to a stronger PPC community at the end.<br><br>hS<br><br>PS: In the interests of keeping all our sanity, I&#39;ve topped and tailed this thread with two others which between them showcase what I think are the three key aspects of the PPC community: fannish geekery, excellent writing, and educated snark. If it all gets too much for you, pay a visit to one of them. :) ~hS</p>

            <p>(On a meta note, I suspect people generally don&#39;t scroll this far down the Board. If that&#39;s the case, could someone either link to or repost this further up the front page?)<br><br>So, I&#39;ve looked over this thread and some of the discussion from March, and I&#39;ve noticed that there&#39;s a general sentiment that there&#39;s something wrong with the PPC&#39;s social dynamics. That is, something about how we view each other, interact with each other, or what we do or don&#39;t do as a community is causing a serious issue.<br><br>However, no one seems to quite agree on what the problems are, let alone the solutions. I&#39;ve heard (this is not a comprehensive list):<br>- People being too deferential to oldbies<br>- People expecting the oldbies to run the place<br>- The newbie-oldbie split in general<br>- Newer people not participating in the community like previous new people did<br>- Direct democracy failing, in general, because people don&#39;t engage with discussions like this one<br>- The community being too forgiving of bad behavior<br>- The community tending to ignore bullying when it occurs<br>- Live chats being a cause of drama and problems by their very nature<br>- <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?id=199610;article=306606">A group of people having wound themselves too tightly around Iximaz&#39;s feelings</a><br>- A spade of recent incidents eroding everyone&#39;s trust in each other, especially when it comes to private information<br><br>We&#39;ve already decided that sweeping bullying/harassment under the rug is an issue, and we seem to be doing a decent job (see the Bram thread) of changing our behavior (or are we?). However, as the recent posts in this discussion have shown, other general issues appear to exist.<br><br>So, two questions:<br><br>1. What, if any, are the social dynamics of the PPC that are or could become problems?<br><br>2. Who should do what to solve those problems?<br><br>Then, when it comes to the people or group specifically named as problems, here&#39;s what I&#39;ve heard:<br><br>- Ekyl (Brink): Ekyl and Iximaz seem to be satisfied that the matter is resolved (or at least that appropriate apologies have been given), so there&#39;s probably not much more to discuss here<br><br>- Ekyl (DIA ownership claims): Ekyl&#39;s said he sort-of did this in the past and that it won&#39;t be happening again. It&#39;s unclear (but likely) that this counts as a resolution.<br><br>- Ekyl (being manipulative/insincere): There&#39;s a general sense that Ekyl&#39;s words often come off this way, even if (as a lot of people seem to believe) that wasn&#39;t intended. Ekyl has been given advice on how to avoid giving off this impression.. It&#39;s unclear that this counts as a resolution.<br><br>- Scapegrace: No clear consensus. Can we get a few more opinions?<br><br>- HerrWozzek and Nord Ronnoc: They&#39;ve apparently mutually decided to stay away from each other, which should resolve things<br><br>- Granz: Has apologized and acknowledged that the second chat server was a bad idea. It sounds like this has resolved the issue, but it&#39;s not entirely clear given how few people are in that part of the thread.<br><br>- Huinesoron and Neshomeh: The general sense seems to be that they&#39;re good people who put a lot of work into the community, and that they&#39;re not controlling evil dictators who prevent their friends from getting banned or anything like that. They&#39;ve also come up in discussions of the newbie-oldbie split, but the general feeling is that there&#39;s not anything much <i>they</i> can do about it.<br><br>- The witch-hunt: Heck if I know. The thoughts I&#39;ve seen seem to be that no one needs to get banned over that, that it was bad, and that the people who did it shouldn&#39;t do it again. Unfortunately, the people who can accept apologies for what happened there aren&#39;t around anymore, so it&#39;s hard to declare that resolved.<br><br>So, that&#39;s what I&#39;ve heard. Not a very short summary, but these weren&#39;t short threads either.<br><br>On a personal note, it might be a good idea for the people who&#39;ve been told they&#39;ve come off wrong when apologizing during this to retry their apologies, taking the advice they&#39;ve gotten into account.<br><br>- Tomash</p>

            <p>Maybe to address the bad behaviour problem in the future, we could have someone talk to whomever was acting badly. They could ask that person questions, such as why they&#39;re doing this particular thing, how they felt at the time doing it, why they feel that way. <br><br>This is something I thought about because as tempting as it is to just call out the person like they&#39;re bad people, I think we can solve problems with less vitriol and less drama. <br><br>This may be just an obvious solution and if this was something already being done, I wasn&#39;t quite sure.</p>

            <p>I think I&#39;ve touched on most of the things you&#39;ve mentioned, Tomash, but I honestly don&#39;t know anymore. &gt;.&gt;; So, my thoughts on your questions and the specific issues.<br><br>Questions:<br><br>1. Social dynamics. Frankly, as has been stated before, a lot of PPCers are teenagers and young adults. That means you&#39;re still just starting to figure out who you are and how best to deal with the world. On top of that, we&#39;re all a bunch of geeks and misfits, and some of us have additional challenges to face.<br><br>That kinda means the whole &quot;social&quot; thing is not going to run smoothly all the time. Mistakes will happen. The trick, I think, is to remember that it&#39;s not the end of the world. Everyone makes mistakes, no one is perfect, and that doesn&#39;t make us horrible people. It just makes us people. I think we should all make an effort to remember that, and to forgive ourselves and each other when we fail to live up to our ideals, and not to give up, but to keep on trying. I firmly believe our hearts are in the right place, and we&#39;ll do fine if we just try.<br><br>2. Who should do what. I guess I sort of answered this already. Further, though, I agree with whoever said we&#39;ve done a lot of good work in this thread, and that it&#39;s showed above. Let&#39;s keep it up.<br><br>Issues:<br><br>1a. Brink. I agree there&#39;s not much more to say here. Unless someone else has a similar issue in the near future, I think we should let it go.<br><br>1b. DIA ownership. I&#39;m content with what Ekyl has said about this. Personally, I&#39;ll be fully satisfied when he actually publishes something, anything, since he keeps on saying he&#39;s got all this stuff in the works. I know real life gets in the way—boy, do I know it!—but all the same, I have to admit I roll my eyes every time he says it at this point. I don&#39;t see any harm in it, though, as long as he recognizes that intending to do a thing doesn&#39;t mean anything if he never does it.<br><br>1c. Manipulative/insincere. I&#39;d be happier if Ekyl would acknowledge the advice I&#39;ve given, but I&#39;ll be content if he acts on it.<br><br>2. Scapegrace. <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=308464;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">See below</a>.<br><br>3. Herr and Nord. I see that Herr has <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=308422;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">apologized</a> at least in part, and yeah, it looks like they plan not to interact at all anymore. If that&#39;s as good as it&#39;s going to get, I&#39;ll accept it, and hope that&#39;s the last we hear about the two of them.<br><br>4. Granz. I never thought Granz was being malicious in the first place, and I am satisfied with his apology.<br><br>5. Me and hS. I can&#39;t speak for hS, but I&#39;m inclined to embrace my role as a community leader, official or unofficial (but preferably un), and try to be better at it. I have personally made a commitment to be more aware of the example I&#39;m setting by my actions and to be conscientious of the type of leader and teacher I want to be. Not a tyrannical dictator, but a helper, a guide, a source of advice and perhaps even instruction and discipline, when it&#39;s called for. Some have said they think of this community as a family, so maybe I&#39;m a den mom. Maybe I&#39;ll start doing what Mum&#39;s the Word used to do and hand out virtual brownies on special occasions. ^_~ That doesn&#39;t absolve anyone else of responsibility, of course. If we&#39;re a family, then the older siblings (middlebies) are still expected to set a good example and help the younger ones (newbies), too.<br><br>6. Witch-hunt. I think most, if not all, of the people involved have expressed some sort of regret for what happened. I don&#39;t think there&#39;s any way to guarantee nothing of the sort will ever happen again, but if all of us who were here for this one can recognize the signs of groupthink and echochamberism in the future, we&#39;ll do better.<br><br>7. Oh hey, there is no seven. Yay!<br><br>So, that&#39;s what I&#39;ve got at this point.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>There is, unfortunately, one outstanding issue that has been brought to my attention. I&#39;ve attempted to speak with Scape in private about this, but gotten no response after three days from my latest message, six since my first. Since I know she&#39;s been on the Board, and I believe she&#39;s been in communication with others by e-mail in this time, I&#39;m forced to conclude she&#39;s attempting to dodge the issue. Therefore, it&#39;s up to the Board to make sure that isn&#39;t allowed to continue.<br><br>The issue is this: back in March, when people in Discord were worried about Iximaz and trying to pin the blame on July, Scapegrace sent a long series of text messages to July, which included some very insulting and hurtful remarks. July mentioned this and quoted one of the remarks <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?id=199610;article=306692;search_term=goodbye">in her goodbye post</a>. There&#39;s more where that came from, but it&#39;s not mine to share. As far as I am aware, Scapegrace has yet to acknowledge that this happened or to apologize for it.<br><br>I am now calling for both to be done here, in public. I understand that Scapegrace was upset and worried about Iximaz at the time, but caring for Iximaz doesn&#39;t excuse attacking whoever she happens to be mad at at the time, especially when they have no idea what happened to prompt it. That&#39;s not how we want our members to handle their problems in this community, which is exactly what this thread is about.<br><br>Furthermore, I&#39;m given to understand that July hasn&#39;t been the only target of this, meaning Iximaz&#39;s friends taking it upon themselves to have a go at whoever she has a beef with, whether behind their backs or to their faces. hS has been a target to a lesser degree, as seen <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=306504;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">here</a> (apology for that is <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=306519;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">here</a>), and SkarmorySilver&#39;s name came up, too, though I&#39;ll leave it to him to say whether he feels that&#39;s the case.<br><br>I think there&#39;s a fine line between commiserating with a friend over something you don&#39;t agree with and being a jerk to people you don&#39;t like. Not everyone has to be best friends with everyone else, that&#39;s fine, but if not getting along with someone spills over into actual attacks on them, that line has definitely been crossed.<br><br>A public apology to July and a promise not to do it again, to anyone, is required. If Scape fails to deliver said apology and promise, I leave it to the community to decide what the consequences should be.<br><br>As for me, until that happens, I must regretfully withdraw my <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=307934;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">previous compliments to Scapegrace</a>, and register my disappointment both in my own judgement and in Scapegrace, who accepted my kind remarks knowing she had done this and had expressed no remorse for it. I&#39;ve also extended my own apologies to July for straight-up forgetting that Scape had attacked her recently, even if I didn&#39;t know the full extent of it.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>(Yeah, this is the post I mentioned wanting to make--if there was another, I&#39;m no longer sure what it was.)<br><br><i>Furthermore, I&#39;m given to understand that July hasn&#39;t been the only target of this, meaning Iximaz&#39;s friends taking it upon themselves to have a go at whoever she has a beef with, whether behind their backs or to their faces.

I try to hold myself back from situations when I&#39;m angry until such time as I can think a little more clearly; I am very much <i>not</i> in the habit of going around attacking people. I sincerely hope that should I ever have a problem with someone I would bring it to the Board (or, if I felt it could be resolved easily, in private) as calmly and clearly as I could manage. I also hope that I have done so in the past; if I have failed in that, I sincerely apologise now, and hope that I did the same at the time.<br><br>I have certainly done the commiseration thing. It&#39;s a pretty common thing to do with your friends, even in cases when you don&#39;t agree with their opinion or you just want to be an ear for them to rant to. One can agree that a situation sucks and try to provide support despite one&#39;s own opinion, in most times. But I would like to make it clear that I have never gone about attacking people because someone else was upset, and that if I were ever to call someone out about their behavior towards friends of mine I intend it to be with having hopefully heard something from both sides, and most likely presented on the Board and as rationally as possible, unless I felt it could be resolved off-Board.<br><br>If I have something important and complex (or potentially controversial) to say, whether it&#39;s on the Board or in a chat, I generally read it over and let it sit and read it over again. I do not particularly enjoy arguments, and I find it abhorrent in most cases to curse out or go after someone.<br><br>I&#39;m certainly not perfect. Human beings don&#39;t tend to be. But I strive to express myself carefully when I&#39;m angry or upset, particularly online and <i>in public</i> online. And I apologized for any time when I&#39;ve failed to do so, especially if I hurt someone by it.<br><br>I doubt that this post was specifically directed towards me. However, given that I&#39;ve visibly fallen into the category of &#39;Iximaz&#39;s friends&#39; for a while now, I wanted to make it clear that, to my knowledge, I have never joined in behavior like this, and that I have no intention of starting.<br><br>~Zing</p>

I haven&#39;t heard any other specific names.<br><br>I think the &quot;social dynamics&quot; issue here is that some people feel that Ix&#39;s friends constitute a clique, and that this clique is dominating the PPC scene in a way that puts off people who aren&#39;t &quot;in.&quot; To be clear, I don&#39;t think this is Iximaz&#39;s fault. We like her, we like her contributions, that&#39;s fine. I also think this is a situation that can be alleviated by more words from more different people, when it comes to writing and to community stuff. Folks, you&#39;re free to do your own thing regardless of what anybody else is doing. It&#39;s a free Board.<br><br>However, do be aware of the nature of cliques, and their pitfalls for those who are &quot;in&quot; as well as those who are &quot;out.&quot; Zing, for instance, I&#39;d caution you that, if you don&#39;t feel you can disagree with Ix without risking serious consequences to your friendship, that&#39;s not good. Maybe I&#39;m reading something into your words that&#39;s not there, in which case do please correct me, but still, that&#39;s an example of the sort of thing to watch out for: feeling pressure to go along with Ix, or the rest of the group, in spite of your own feelings. Especially when it comes to how welcome other people are made to feel in/around the group.<br><br>Again, just to be clear, I don&#39;t say any of this is Iximaz&#39;s fault, because that would imply deliberate emotional manipulation on her part, which I do not believe is happening. I think it&#39;s basically a side effect of having a magnetic personality.<br><br>Just, y&#39;know, be aware of how other people feel, and how you feel, too. Maybe make an effort to review stuff by &quot;outsiders&quot; as much as you review &quot;insiders.&quot; Stuff like that.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>When I mentioned lending an ear even when one&#39;s own opinion is different, I meant it more as just trying to be there for the other person even if you don&#39;t feel as strongly about the issue (or think neither person is especially at fault even though one or both are now upset), rather than as worrying about huge consequences for having and voicing a different opinion. And that form of commiseration often includes mentioning your own opinion as an option for what might be going on, even as you lend an ear. So, thankfully, I can say that you saw an unintentional implication in my words.<br><br>~Z, who has jet lag and is hopefully clear enough in this post to not be very confusing</p>

            <p>Specifically, that of interacting with a friend or relative you&#39;re close to who&#39;s upset about something.<br><br>I&#39;d also add that not worrying about the consequences and lending your own perspective should be done sensitively, unless, I suppose, you feel the person desperately needs a wake-up call (or the person hates being coddled in general). That is to say, your aim is to help them move past what they&#39;re dealing with, not upset them further when it won&#39;t help anything. For instance, I might wait to add my perspective until the person is a little calmer and ready to potentially consider what I&#39;m saying, even just briefly, rather than viewing it as an attack or an attempt at devaluing what they&#39;re feeling.  There&#39;s still no guarantee they&#39;ll agree with me, especially right away, but at the very least it&#39;ll increase the chances of them not feeling like their friend is kicking them when they&#39;re down for no good reason. People tend to listen better when they&#39;re not furious.<br><br>Not everyone reacts this way, of course, but I certainly have friends and relatives who do, and that&#39;s the experience I&#39;m speaking from.<br><br>~Z</p>

            <p>I find this interjection to be inappropriate. I don&#39;t think any reasonable person would interpret &quot;staying out of each other&#39;s way&quot; as including an exception for making remarks <i>about</i> the other person to which, if they kept to the agreement, they would not be able to respond.

True or not, I think you&#39;d do well to bear in mind that you, too, have an image problem around here, and if that doesn&#39;t make you sympathetic, it should at least make you think twice about throwing stones.<br><br>Regardless of your motives here, if you intend to have nothing to do with Scapegrace going forward, then I expect you <i>both</i> to do what Herr and Nord are doing and each act as though the other does not exist.

            <p>As noted in my response to Tomash, I&#39;ve kind of stepped back from the outright &quot;I want her gone&quot; talk. I&#39;ll admit that was kind of a kneejerk reaction. That said, I&#39;m still very concerned about what feels, to me, like a pattern of behaviour that&#39;s been going on for a long time with little sign of actually changing. Of course, it&#39;s not on me alone to decide what happens there, nor should it be; we&#39;re not a dictatorship here, after all. </p>

            <p>I understand that you are making an effort to improve here, but this is a direct attack on someone who has expressed apologies to everyone she has caused trouble with. Believe me, I would know. I don&#39;t condone her past behavior towards July any more than the next person, but you had no right to say that about someone who <i>is</i> making an effort to improve and willingly acknowledges her problem. Stand down, please, or you could very well have the very words you&#39;ve typed spoken about <i>you</i> in the future, which is not something anyone wants to happen to them.<br><br>And for the record, as indicated by the very post you replied to, something <i>is</i> being done about Scape&#39;s behavior, both by herself and by others. We <i>know</i> she acted irrationally and irresponsibly and <i>she herself</i> knows it too, and we want to see her move forward as a person as well as a community member. She needs the time to lick her wounds - we all do. This entire thread has been about putting out the fire, and we&#39;re not in the mood to have any more fuel added to it. <i>Not at all.</i></p>

            <p>For example, I&#39;ve been attacked and insulted by her in the past and I never got so much as a whisper. But I&#39;m content to drop the matter because I have no interest in getting dragged back into the drama; my concern is more the overall pattern of behaviour. For almost the entire time she&#39;s been here that seems to have been the pattern - attacking people, being told to stop, giving some apology, then as soon as the people telling her off turn their backs she&#39;s right back at it. I feel like it&#39;s a serious problem and it&#39;s just kicked down the road.</p>

            <p>When you felt attacked, did you say anything?

            <p>So, while I can produce a longer draft if people want it, this is the basic version of my proposal, should there be community support for it:<br><br>As per Tomash&#39;s suggestion, Scapegrace is presented an official &quot;one last chance&quot; to alter her behaviour. She is <i>never</i> to attack, insult, harass, antagonise, deride, or otherwise lash out at any other member of this community again, on pain of banning. The length of this ban is variable - I myself think a permanent ban would be extreme - but should not be under one month in duration. If this occurs, and there is no resultant improvement in behaviour afterwards, I would be much more in favour of suggesting a permanent ban.</p>

            <p>Did you mean for the items on that list to be interpreted narrowly and only apply in very clear cases? Because if not, the line I think you&#39;ve drawn circles a lot of fuzzy gray area and is easy to cross accidentally, which seems inappropriate for a line that will trigger an automatic ban when crossed. For example, I could argue that Scape&#39;s response to Bram/zdeminsia is banworthy under your proposal as I understand it. Therefore, I vote against this proposal as written.<br><br>Now, I had an idea, which might be rather silly: If Scapegrace lashes out at someone in a way that results in apologies/amends/etc. being called for, she [should/shall] not interact with the community except to resolve that issue until the issue is fully addressed, that is, until the apologies are accepted or uninvolved parties determine that the person owed an apology is being unreasonable in refusing it. In other words, if Scape screws up, she should [act as if she&#39;s/be] banned from everything but fixing the problem until it&#39;s fixed.<br><br>This proposal would, I think, address the concern several people have about Scapegrace sometimes not seeing the whole &quot;making amends&quot; thing all the way through.  I&#39;ll admit that  this all would be  a rather annoying, painful, and/or unpleasant restriction to operate under. However, unlike what you called for, I&#39;d be comfortable with my plan being something in our general toolkit of &quot;things we can impose on people/ask them to impose on themselves in the event that something about their behavior isn&#39;t great&quot;.<br><br>The reason some of that wording is in brackets is because, unless my mental models of people are off (which they very well might be), something like this would work better if adopted voluntarily.<br><br>- Tomash</p>

            <p>Whilst I am loath to write this here I will seeing as my partner is seemingly akin to a penny dreadful monster currently on the boards with some cheering for her and others wishing to haul out the pitchforks as it were...<br><br>Scape IS seeking help for her mental health. As the person who lives with the woman I can assure you of that. She has registered with a GP close to our home. Scape knows her anxiety paranoia and rage needs assistance. I know it needs assistance and we are making it happen..<br><br>You guys don&#39;t know me from Adam and frankly this wasn&#39;t the ideal way I wanted to introduce myself to the board. Have you guys noticed Scape has for the most part stayed away from this thread? She is trying. <br><br>At the moment we are going through a lot as a couple.  Not that it is anything to be used as an excuse as such but rather you know... Scape won&#39;t say a word as it is &quot;my&quot; business. My best friend is fighting the big C for the third time. Surgury before chemo today. She has animals and will be unwell for a while and as such I am moving into her place to care for them. The issue is I am also a carer. The gent we live with has epilepsy diabetes and mental health issues so needs someone there. <br><br>Scape is basically gong to be splitting herself between homes. Supporting the both of us. As I am sure anyone here who has ever had anxiety will understand that is immensely damn hard.<br><br>This whole situation has been weighing on my girl. And things that effect my girl impact me.<br><br>If you want her to go by some sort of code then please lay it out,  get it done. I would however ask that in regards to Ekyls suggestions for Scapegrace, if that is put into place that he abide by them too. No jibes, nitpicking, jabs or antagonist acts. Frankly it is evident there is no friendship there from the posts I have read/researched. I suggest the &quot;rule&quot; goes both ways.<br><br>Mel </p>

            <p>Scape and I have already agreed to avoid each other, it seems. That&#39;s also why I said I really feel like someone who isn&#39;t me should spearhead any drafts written up.

            <p>...I should also note that in most cases, it was because of me doing or saying something foolish, and I always immediately apologized and backpedaled the second I was called out on them, a habit which I have picked up from the days just before and since the DeviantArt group fiasco I mentioned downthread. The one or two instances I recall when Scape continued pressing the issues after my apologies resulted in her being called out for doing so as well, after which the matter was dropped. (And AFAIK, only Scape has gone that far, and none of her peers have unless I, in a fit of irrational emotions, gave them a legitimate reason to do so.) The one and only time when Scape attacked me without any justification was when I paged the Board at large for a collab request last year, and once again, she was immediately scolded for it (by Ix, IIRC). However, one thing I also feel is worth pointing out is that Scape apologized to me for this kerfuffle and the previous incidents, both publicly and via PM, shortly after the fact. I believe that is a rational response, and I&#39;m glad to see that she has been consistently working hard to improve her behavior.<br><br>The thing that hurt so much after the dA incident was that only a few people called out the people responsible for being insulting, and fewer still for hurting my feelings, because they weren&#39;t familiar with my side of the story and were mostly unaware that it was my stereotypical inflated teenage ego and inexperience that led to things blowing up in my face. Lack of action can be taken as a lack of support for the affected party. I have to say therefore that I admire both the Board and Scape herself for their swift response and willingness to make amends and curb the bad behavior almost the moment they realized that something had gone wrong. That&#39;s a level of civility most people who get caught up in Internet drama don&#39;t have.<br><br>So all in all, I do feel that Scape has caused problems with me in the past, but the fact that she&#39;s both acknowledged/apologized for them and her substantial efforts to improve are laudable in my book. I sadly cannot condone her actions towards July, though, from what I know, and it&#39;s actually quite relieving to know that she feels horrible for those as well. Her apology to July just below is a commendable gesture, but I must also provide the caveat that going forward she has to indeed not handle anyone, EVER, in the same manner that she did during the incident in March. Remember: On the Internet, you never know who you can hurt with just a single sentence, especially in places where you cannot take it back.<br><br>Also, a more personal P.S. paging Scape herself: Sorry for not being around to continue our co-write, since I&#39;ve been scooped up by so many IRL things that I have far too little time to do all the Internet stuff I want to, let alone write PPC stuff. I also understand completely that such circumstances also apply to you as well AFAIK, and I just hope that we can find the time to continue writing together as soon as our horrendously clogged schedules allow it. (I mean, the co-write itself kinda is our way of making up for that last kerfuffle we had, so...)</p>

            <p>First, a bit of admin. I assume you&#39;ve been sending emails to <a href="mailto:harryheath99@hotmail.com">harryheath99@hotmail.com</a>; I got locked out of it about six weeks ago and have not gained access to it since, as hS will attest. My new email address is <a href="mailto:hheath1992@hotmail.com">hheath1992@hotmail.com</a>, so if you want to send me anything via email, send it there.<br><br>With regards to what happened to July:<br><br>It&#39;s not about Ix. It was not about Ix at the time. It was about how I felt, well, that I wasn&#39;t really her friend. I was just a convenient ear to talk when someone said something she didn&#39;t like. After she returned from deployment, we barely spoke; we spoke at New Year&#39;s Eve and then nothing for three months until she starts fuming at me about Matt Cipher tangentially mentioning her in a post celebrating the women of the Board, which set her off for reasons she elaborated on the Board.<br><br>After that conversation ended, I got to thinking... was this all our friendship was going to be? I accept that I could have been more active in attempting to contact her, but she has an extremely time-consuming job and frankly, I didn&#39;t want to bother her with the various trivialities of my life. So, a couple of days later, I decided to cut ties. I sent a long, rambling series of messages over Google Chat, blocked July everywhere, and left it at that.<br><br>Then all this started happening.<br><br>I didn&#39;t talk about what I&#39;d said because, since it was a private conversation with someone I neither wanted to talk to or about, I didn&#39;t feel obliged to go into it. More to the point, I didn&#39;t <i>want</i> to go into it. During the time when the harassment was going on in the Discord, I was much more concerned with Ix than I was with July; I was not posting in the Discord at the time because I was trying to get hold of them through Google Chat, which is my primary means of communication these days. I&#39;m really bad at checking my email and, as evidenced here, updating people as to any new email addresses.<br><br>I don&#39;t recall everything that was said in that rant - which is <i>not</i> an invitation for anyone to throw it up on the Board, by the by - but, well, &quot;Scapegrace made cutting, hurtful remarks&quot; is not nearly as unknown a refrain as it should be. I was and remain done with July. I didn&#39;t want to talk to her any more, so I sent a message explaining my position.<br><br><i>That all being said.</i><br><br>This obviously hurt July far more deeply than I ever intended, through a combination of evidently ill-chosen words and unfortunate timing. Those are just excuses, though. Someone else contacted me about this whole mess with July and, well, the more I think about it, the more I feel like I was wrong to cut contact in the way that I did.<br><br>July, in the event you&#39;re reading this: I&#39;m sorry for what I said, and when I said it, and why I said it. I&#39;m sorry for how callous it was, and I&#39;m sorry for the hurt it caused you. I am truly, deeply sorry for it, because you don&#39;t deserve it and you never have.<br><br>I can&#39;t make things right between us; I don&#39;t think I ever could. You need better friends than me. Find them, and find some happiness. Because that&#39;s what you deserve. Not some dickhead from a decaying seaside town several thousand miles away to whom you could not turn when you needed it, but real friends, upon whom you can rely, and who can commiserate with you and console you when you need them to.<br><br>I am not that person any more, and I don&#39;t think I can cope with being that person for you again.<br><br>And I think that&#39;s what I&#39;m sorriest for of all.</p>

            <p>First, I&#39;m sorry for thinking you were blowing me off when in truth I was basically speaking to an empty room. Thanks for the updated e-mail address.<br><br>Thanks also for the apology. I appreciate it, and having actually seen the contents of the messages, I am inclined to believe your explanation for the most part—I can certainly sympathize with not wanting to be only a foul-weather friend. I know not everyone reads you as sincere, though (Ekyl being one that I know of), so I&#39;m gonna try to get this cleared up beyond a shadow of a doubt.<br><br>First, could you please clarify the timeline? The timestamps tell a slightly different story than you do. I believe the Board, Discord, and the screenshots I have are all on US Eastern time, so looking at the screencaps and the Board, it appears that your messages to July started right about the same time as <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=306433;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board;pagemark=75">Alleb&#39;s post</a> went up on the Board, only about half an hour after you were in the chat <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=306504;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board;pagemark=75">saying this</a>. If I understood you right, you said that once the drama started in Discord, you were too busy trying to get in touch with Iximaz to be thinking about July, but it&#39;s hard to see how the two things can be disconnected when they took place right on top of each other.<br><br>Also, the <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=306268;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board;pagemark=75">Matt</a> <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=306364;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board;pagemark=75">thing</a> happened March 8-10. The drama went down over a week later. I know I am completely capable of condensing a week to a few days in my crummy memory, but since I&#39;m putting together a timeline, I&#39;m... well, putting together a timeline.<br><br>I also have to question what you mean by &quot;This obviously hurt July far more deeply than I ever intended,&quot; because it reads like you did intend to hurt her at least a little. It&#39;s a pedantic reading, to be sure, but with roughly a week between deciding to cut ties and actually doing it, the hurtful bits appear quite premeditated and intentional indeed. If that&#39;s not what you meant, would you please say what you did mean?<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I&#39;m fairly certain that those posts to which you linked - which, again, are things that I deeply regret and for which I am sorry - were at one a.m. GMT, rather than US Eastern. Is that the five or six hours behind one? I can never quite remember. In any event, I assure you that I was in no way influenced by what was happening at the time with Ix; that would be far crueller than I am capable of being.<br><br>The Matt thing, well, I thought it was only a few days before.

            <p>Now I just wanna know this, because it&#39;s a puzzle.<br><br>I&#39;m pretty sure the Board is on US Eastern, because I&#39;m on US Central and it&#39;s one hour ahead of me. If the Discord logs are on Central, per Tomash, that puts your comments in Discord at about 2:00 pm EST on the 16th, Alleb having posted at about 1:30 pm EST, and everything starting off with Ix&#39;s goodbye message in Discord at about 10:30 am EST (9:30 am CST). I&#39;m informed the 1:30 pm (actually 13:33) timestamp on the screenshots is EST, too, so that still puts everything fairly close together. EST is GMT -5, so for you those times in order would&#39;ve been 3:30 pm, 6:30 pm, and 7:00 pm, respectively.<br><br>It&#39;s still possible that something in there is wrong, but I don&#39;t think so. Even though the Discord logs only say &quot;Yesterday,&quot; that&#39;s from the perspective of having been captured and posted on Friday the 17th, so should be Thursday the 16th.<br><br>That aside, though: You say none of what was happening with Ix or the Discord influenced your messages to July. I&#39;d find the whole thing less cruel if it were sparked off by concern as opposed to having been stewed over and meditated on for days prior, but okay. In that case, I&#39;d like to restate my requirement for your promise that it won&#39;t happen again to anyone else. Going off in the heat of the moment is one thing, but this, according to you, was not that. So, next time you&#39;re thinking about doing something similar... don&#39;t do it.

            <p>The fact is, the PPC is pretty huge now, even if we didn&#39;t count lurkers.  (Lurkers, we love you, you don&#39;t need to lurk.)  In a group that big, A) there are going to be some people who don&#39;t get along, not because either has wronged the other, but simply due to a difference in personalities, outlooks, or writing voices; and B) it&#39;s essentially impossible for all of us to interact with each other within a reasonable time frame.  The Lounge/Chat isn&#39;t visited by everyone in the community, and even those who use it are blocked from being on all at once due to time zones, sleep schedules, and work/school/social obligations.  Even the Board, while our official hub used by presumably everyone, isn&#39;t going to see every Boarder in every thread.  We have different interests.  It&#39;s a good thing, though, that we have such a large and diverse <s>cast of characters</s> set of persons present, with the variety of viewpoints and experience that brings.   While I can see the potential for communication breaks, I vehemently oppose shutting down the chat to &quot;force&quot; everyone to only interact on the Board.  I understand that it may feel to Boarders who don&#39;t use the chat that said chat is a source of drama, since such drama has leaked out onto the Board over the years, but there has been so much smart and fun discussion in the thousands and thousands of hours in between that I wouldn&#39;t give up for all this world.  Not to mention the role-play channel in the current Discord chat: pages and pages of non-canon character studies and insights into the way Boarders&#39;s agents think.  (9.73 MB of RP, in fact; you&#39;d better believe I&#39;ve been backing that up since day one!)  I don&#39;t want to deprive any part of the community of the abilities to engage in easy, non-space devouring RP (except on doctorlit&#39;s hard drive, lololol) and plain, day-to-day, natural dialogue.  I like the idea someone had of making regular &quot;reports&quot; to the Board on some of the discussions and #recs<em>and</em>plugs suggestions taking place in the chat to help keep the entire community more engaged with each other.  But again: we&#39;re a huge group of <i>n</i> people, and I honestly don&#39;t think we&#39;ll ever see a discussion in any community space with all <i>n</i> participating.  And I don&#39;t see that as an automatic bad thing.  We can be members of the same team—coworkers, really—with the goal of making our writing setting the best it can be without everyone knowing everyone else on a close, personal level.<br><br>As for specific cases:<br><br>-Scapegrace: I do feel that Scape makes an effort to reign in her more negative reactions to things, and is overall a more positive contributor to the community than a negative one, so long as the improvement continues.<br><br>-Ekyl: I&#39;m satisfied that his specific mistakes in the past have been recognized by him, and that he understands why they were incorrect. I also believe and that his apologies are indeed sincere, and that any perception to the contrary is due more to his writing voice than anything else.<br><br>-Huinesoron and Neshomeh: I&#39;m still a bit boggled that anyone in the community viewed these two, or any other oldbie, in any kind of dictatorial light.  From my viewpoint, they both are always calm and reasonable voices in any serious discussion; the only time I can recall when they made an error was with Lily-Gnome during Jacer&#39;s banning process, and for God&#39;s sake, folks, one mistake in over ten years of competent community service does not a dictator(s) make.<br><br>-all other instances: I&#39;m satisfied that all other parties have been sufficiently made aware of their mistakes and understand why they were mistakes, and intend not to repeat them in the future.<br><br>—doctorlit</p>

            <p>As has been mentioned elsewhere in this thread, making light-hearted summations of negative events feels callous and misguided at best. I feel like it&#39;s too easy to forget that people were harmed by those incidents. People who are very obviously still here.

            <p>I&#39;m amused by the idea of telling history in general in the style of a Greek tragedy, but no. Not here.<br><br>Yes, it would be potentially useful to have perhaps a 2-3 sentence summary of past events and a link or two. It would give context to people who weren&#39;t around, and might help prevent history repeating itself. A page like that could be linked to at times when it&#39;s relevant.<br><br>But I don&#39;t think it should be a wiki page. I don&#39;t think it should be brought up at regular times. If you want to make hosting Grand Concilliary threads to deal with new issues an annual thing, okay, go ahead; I can&#39;t exactly stop you, though I do strongly suggest that hS isn&#39;t constantly saddled with setting it up and running it. But if a record of past events is to be a thing, I propose it be a document linked somewhere--perhaps the wiki page about the Board, or else somewhere much more infrequently seen--and only be brought up <i>when it is relevant</i>. That is, when a similar incident occurs or when someone sees one brewing and wants to head it off (such as the new Discord server/PPC2? I don&#39;t know much about the latter, but I understand they were similar and Granz had no knowledge of PPC2).<br><br>I more or less understand the idea behind your proposal: we are, as a community, built around making goodfic from bad. And if you were to make other Board events into a play somehow, I probably wouldn&#39;t object--but not these ones. Not the serious ones, the ones that involve doxxing and bullying and painful arguments and people crying and losing their trust in parts of the PPC or in the community as a whole. Not the ones that involve accusations (valid or otherwise) and bans and leaving posts. Make a brief summary, link the archives, but do <i>not</i> make an entertaining play out of it. These are not topics for that. Not now, not ever.<br><br>~Zingenmir</p>

            <p>Someone relatively new PM&#39;d me on Discord asking where to look to find out about the Jacer stuff because it seemed important now. I had to go dig up the altchives link (for the record, new people, <a href="https://technodann.github.io/PPC-board-2.0/archive/2012/07b.html#post-45599">this is the thread that started it all</a>, <a href="https://technodann.github.io/PPC-board-2.0/archive/2012/07b.html#post-45523">this is a followup departure post</a>, and <a href="https://technodann.github.io/PPC-board-2.0/archive/2012/07b.html#post-45442">here is where constitutional amendments started getting hammered out</a>).<br><br>We should have some document that gives newer people the ability to figure out what the heck all the oldbies are going on about. Short summaries and a list of archive links is probably sufficient. Heck, leave off the summaries and just gather up all the old-drama related archive links in one place so finding them for the next newbie with a historical question isn&#39;t a huge pain in the neck. <br><br>Given how easy it is for stuff to hide in the corners of the wiki, a wiki page might be well-hidden enough. If that still seems too visible, then use a document linked from a wiki page. <br><br>No matter what, like a lot of people have pointed out, any  official (or seemingly official) document needs to be serious. There seem to be too many pitfalls involved in trying to do anything but when it comes to creating a referencable record of historical stuff.<br><br>- Tomash</p>

            <p>I&#39;m not particularly thrilled that this subject has been raised, either. As I said to doc, I don&#39;t enjoy being reminded of that time my friends decided to assume the worst of me and nearly ran me off because of a poor choice of words.<br><br><b>However:</b><br><br>I&#39;m not sure that gives me the right to even request that no one ever mention it, or to suggest that new people don&#39;t have some right to know the history of this place, skeletons and all. So I won&#39;t.<br><br>I will request that it not be discussed any further in this thread, though. It was three years ago, and I think that&#39;s well past any reasonable statute of limitations on dredging things up with the intent to rehash them. It&#39;s <i>not</i> relevant unless people think hS and I, or anyone else, need to suffer for it any more than we already have, in which case I will happily take my leave of the Board, because I have no room in my life for that level of f***ery.<br><br>Now that I&#39;ve got that out of the way...<br><br>On the subject of making things easier to find, if we really must, then once again I think the wiki holds the answer you seek. Ages ago, I started a page called <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/History_of_the_PPC%2C_Part_One">History of the PPC, Part One</a> with the intent of summing up major events like this in concise chronological order, with links to pages (on- or offsite) with greater detail. Nobody ever did anything with it, and I lost interest, but it&#39;s still there. In the PPC History and Events categories. Waiting to be useful.<br><br>Just, y&#39;know, remember that people got hurt in all of these things. Recording what happened for posterity is not in itself a bad idea, IMO, but whoever does it, please be sensitive about it, all right?<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I also don&#39;t think we need to be dredging this stuff up and rehashing it. It was five years ago, and I sure don&#39;t want anyone to suffer any more on account of what happened back then. I&#39;m sorry for bringing up those unpleasant memories further.<br><br>I also don&#39;t think anyone <i>wanted</i> to rehash that. Doc brought it up in an offhand way, and I posted links because I had gotten the sense that several people were worried that an argument was about to start and were confused as to what everyone was referring to. If I&#39;ve missed some post where we were about to start rehashing that mess again, please let me know.<br><br>I&#39;m going to second the request that we drop the subject here, since it&#39;s not relevant to anything we&#39;re still discussing  on likely to discuss (it was briefly slightly relevant <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=307856;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">during a discussion two weeks back</a>, but that&#39;s over now).<br><br>However, I do think that it&#39;s important that we remember our history, including some of the skeletons. How will we avoid repeating our mistakes once almost everyone here today has left (if trends continue, the list of names on the Board will be way different in five-ish years) if we don&#39;t remember our history, or worse, insist that everyone forget about what happened and never speak of it again?<br><br>If, a good long time from now, the early stages of an angry mob start forming in whatever-we&#39;ll-be-using-for-chat (I should hope this never happens, but who knows), I hope that someone will point at what happened last March to remind everyone about what happened last time we tried that sort of thing. Sure, if I&#39;m still around, it&#39;ll mean being reminded of my stupidity and the 12-odd hours where my permaban over a mistake was looking rather likely, but that doesn&#39;t give me the right to tell people not to spread and preserve the lessons we&#39;ve learned from what happened there.<br><br>And yes, whoever starts working on this, sensitivity is very important.<br><br>- Tomash</p>

            <p>Like I said, the only incident that I actually tried parodying in a mission was probably the one with either zdimensia or 7.65x54R, I forget which, and even then I didn&#39;t name names or actually reference the event itself, just what would have happened if someone had tried something similar to what they did. This was also a while after they were unanimously permabanned, so they probably wouldn&#39;t know (or care); it&#39;s possible that they may still find our written works, though, which is why I still only vaguely referenced it.<br><br>In general, I just feel uneasy regarding the handling of drama for entertainment value - I&#39;m not saying it can&#39;t be done, but I feel that if the people involved were still around they would be offended on so many levels. I don&#39;t know how to handle this, honestly. I just don&#39;t.<br><br>Perhaps the old saying, &quot;It seemed like a good idea at the time&quot; may be relevant here.

            <p>Because I know that if there was a situation where <i>I</i> buggered up, got banned for a bit, and then came back, having apologised and accepted the blame and all, I certainly wouldn&#39;t want a tongue-in-cheek play about the whole bloody thing, and about how much of a big git I was through it! <br><br>I do get that reporting this stuff is important, and that you can&#39;t just sort of leave things lying around and pretend they never happened, but at the same time, I dunno - I just feel that the whole thing might be rather awkward, for the people who were actually involved in it. It&#39;s the sort of activity (from what I can figure about it, so far) that you&#39;d need to ask permission for from the fellows involved (assuming they&#39;re still about, obviously), but then it&#39;s also an official report and response to community drama. Which is a somewhat odd mix, that. <br>Although I suppose I do support, in general, reports on those kinds of events, in order to take them apart and look at what broke and what went well, and how to avoid them? That, in general, sounds very useful, indeed, for newbies and such. <br><br>Anyhow, Tomash&#39;s mentioned a long sort of wait following incidents, and then them being written by neutral sources, which is a proposal I know I support, taking it away from the heated situation and all. Assuming this is a thing that happens. <br><br>I&#39;m probably horrifically misunderstanding heaps of things, here, but them&#39;s the thoughts I got.

            <p>To rephrase my position a bit, I think the two things that are absolutely necessary when writing up any reports about past drama is that they be accurate and informative. A serious report abut what went right and what went wrong is definitely useful for that. We should strongly consider  going ahead with producing those. I proposed that about two weeks ago down in the discussion of precedents, and the response was &quot;*cricket noises*&quot;.<br><br>However, Key&#39;s got a point about how making those reports something other than a dull bureaucratic snoozefest would be really neat if we can pull it off, especially given that this is a community centered around funny writing. The question is, of course, can we do that? Probably the only way to answer that is to try it and see.<br><br>So those two rambling paragraphs suggest it might be a good idea to issue two reports. That&#39;s a lot of work. Then again, to make a good non-serious report, you probably need to have written at least the outline of a serious one. So maybe that&#39;s what we should do.<br><br>I actually suspect any report written about March by a neutral party will portray me in a slightly better light than something I&#39;d write, and I support the eventual (not real soon, everything&#39;s still fresh in people&#39;s memory) creation of a report, especially if it&#39;s something people would enjoy reading.<br><br>Heck, one of the reasons I asked to get hurled out the door for a bit was so that we&#39;d have precedent for a temp-ban if anyone posted around real names like that again. It sort of ruins the deterrent value if none of the people who show up in a few years even know it happened.<br><br>- Tomash</p>

            <p>First, &quot;deterrent value&quot; was the wrong phrase. What I meant to say was something more along the lines of &quot;norm-setting value&quot;. I don&#39;t think my actions were an attempt to manipulate the PPC into viewing bans as a punishment, but I was trying to send messages.<br><br>Before I get to that, though, I should clarify. <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?id=199610;article=306866">As I said then</a>, I consider my two-and-a-half month ban to be a punishment. I&#39;m (this thread aside) having to miss out an participating in all the interesting and fun things we get up to, even though there&#39;s nothing external to the PPC that&#39;s stopping me from joining in (like exams or whatnot). That feels bad. It&#39;s supposed to feel bad, because it&#39;s a consequence of me doing a rather bad thing.<br><br>The punitive aspect of my ban works because I still want to be around here, and it&#39;s possible that it only works because it was voluntary. <br><br>That being said, &quot;doxxing is <i>super</i> not tolerated here&quot; is a message I (and 55% of us, unless I&#39;m misremembering people&#39;s rationales for voting) wanted to send with my temporary ban. If that means that me pushing my own ban through counts as me trying to change the rules without bothering with consensus, then, yes, I did that.<br><br>There was also, at the time of the ban, an idea going around (primarily, I think, among the witch-hunt group) that we needed to be harsher on wrongdoers. When I called my ban vote, that idea was in my head. So, yes, a <i>secondary</i> motivation of mine was to make my ban the first act of the New Community Order (tm). Said New Community Order has not materialized. If I had to speculate, it&#39;s because we held off on actually discussing changes until way after the &quot;Something must be done!1!&quot; and other strong emotions wore off.<br><br>One other effect I wanted my ban to have (and still do) is to make more explicit the norm of taking a voluntary break after you really screw up around here, since, even though I called it a ban, that word didn&#39;t quite fit. People don&#39;t usually ban themselves, after all. Therefore, my case might not be a good example if we need to forcibly ban someone.<br><br>As to precedent, it&#39;s up to you guys what precedent my ban sets, if any. I&#39;m not in charge here either. If this ban ends up in PPC history as &quot;Tomash felt awfully guilty and banned himself for a bit, but that was a one-time thing.&quot; then that&#39;s what it&#39;ll be.<br><br>- Tomash</p>

            <p>Cat (or is it Weasel?), thanks for presenting something I&#39;d been thinking about better than I would&#39;ve done.<br><br>My thoughts are that a year-ish (or maybe just a few months) after major incidents, someone reasonably neutral should write them up for the Wiki, and that those write-ups could be collected in one place, so that people who weren&#39;t around for whatever-it-was can look it up and figure out what people are on about and also, like you said, to serve as examples of how we think about these types of serious issues. Most information about old stuff is locked away in people&#39;s memories, and the remainder tends to be rather scattered. See, for example <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Thalia_Weaver">Thalia</a>. Almost everyone who remembers that is gone, and most people here will probably never see that wiki page unless it&#39;s pointed out to them.<br><br>Your suggestions of making these reports entertaining as well as informative is a good one. This is the PPC, after all, and we&#39;re not a super-serious bunch all the time. Calling attention to them every once in a while might also be a good move. The only objection I can think of is that this would &quot;promote legalistic thinking&quot;, but I think we already use past incidents as reference points to help make decisions, so we might as well make that knowledge more freely available.<br><br>Obviously, any write-up of things that are visible in the archives will have a stack of links in it, or at least a bunch of footnotes that link to whatever-it-was.<br><br>If I read you right, and you just volunteered to do a significant part of the work on these, all I can say is good luck. You&#39;ve got a bit of a backlog (off the top of my head: 7.65x54R/SHEEP, zdimensia, Jacer, #PPC2 in general, and probably Glarn sometime next year, and that&#39;s just a lot of the non-recent stuff I was around for).<br> <br>Unrelatedly, good luck with finals!<br><br>Even more unrelatedly, ahhhh, word-final sigma!

            <p>As you yourself have apparently noted, though, it probably shouldn&#39;t be used as a gurantee that people will follow through with solving a problem, more along the lines of highlighting an issue and getting people to pay more attention to it. One idea I&#39;ve experimented with once or twice before is to take the circumstances of a real-life drama, and write a PPC mission in which a character does stupid things similar to those that kicked off the drama and suffers painful consequences for it. I don&#39;t know how well that&#39;d correspond to the seriousness at hand, or if it&#39;ll even work as a means of promoting awareness of the actual problem, but then again I&#39;d tried that approach after the person in question had already gotten banned, and I&#39;m pretty sure trying this idea in response to an actual drama while it&#39;s occurring would be in very bad taste as well...</p>

            <p><br>I think it&#39;s not so much a matter of the people the witch-hunt was apparently targeting accepting apologies from everyone who participated in it, including myself, though granted, that <i>is</i> a big hope of mine and I&#39;m still holding out on the possibility that it happens eventually, no matter how long it takes. What&#39;s more important, though, is that it <i>doesn&#39;t happen again.</i> I&#39;ve been told consistently in real-life that apologies for a bad habit won&#39;t matter if you keep repeating it, and in light of that I&#39;m beginning to worry about the risk of another smear campaign happening to someone else in the future, especially given the hitherto untold issues that have come out of the woodworks in this very discussion. This is, after all, coming from someone who, despite not at all being blameless, was victimized by that very tactic a few years back (with only very about two of the ten or so people involved apologizing for it later). What good would making amends with Desdendelle and JulyFlame do to this community in the long term if, for example, the rest of you go on to turn on me for being, and I quote, &quot;an intolerable and domineering attention whore&quot;, without giving me the chance to explain myself and make up for my own poor behavior? Look, even if Des and July forgive us (and mind you, I&#39;ve already stated above that I sincerely hope they do), what good would that do if we just let this behavior continue?<br><br>I tried as much as I could to stop everyone literally while this whole fiasco was unfolding before my eyes, but I didn&#39;t have any significant time on my hands, and I certainly didn&#39;t want my dad to walk in on me and force an explanation as to what was happening out of me for fear of being forcibly pulled out of this community because of it (as he has done with other online social networks before). From what I&#39;ve heard, though, the heat of the moment meant that there were far too few people speaking out against the witch-hunt in any major capacity, with Des being the only one to have done so IIRC. Almost everyone else either actively participated in said witch-hunt, did nothing to stop it, or tried to speak up but got drowned out.<br><br>And I&#39;m not even going to get started on the accidental doxxing. Everyone&#39;s talked about it better than I ever could, and I just hope that senseless act does not happen again.<br><br>In any case, I think there&#39;s more to be done about the witch-hunt than simply making peace with the targeted people, as welcome as that would be. If it looks like a smear campaign is about to form against anyone, period, then more people need to work harder and speak louder in a bid to nip it in the bud. It also upsets me greatly that I shouldn&#39;t even have to explain all this, and I won&#39;t have to in most cases. If by some anti-miracle this running out of people for petty reasons ends up becoming a habit, gods forbid, then I&#39;ll have lost faith in this community as a whole.</p>

            <p>None of the people involved in the incident with me are to my knowledge members of the PPC, which means they obviously weren&#39;t involved in the witch-hunt against JF. The incident in question involved a DeviantArt group that has since had to heavily revise its management system, with no connections to the PPC.<br><br>That being said, I said before that I wasn&#39;t entirely blameless, and that was because I&#39;d angered these people by shoehorning myself into and attempting to take over their existing writing/art project, which is Not Cool and should in theory be handled by simply removing me from their group, which did happen. The smear campaign happened in the months afterward with several of the people concerned posting hateful remarks about my artwork, interests, and personality on my then-active DeviantArt profiles, and ultimately publishing an angry slanderous journal entry in a similar fashion. Only one or two people have made amends with me afterward for it; the rest have since ostracized me and from what I&#39;ve heard, still regard me in a disparaging light, regardless of how much I&#39;ve changed for the better. (The person who apologized to me via PM said that these people aren&#39;t worth my time, either, partly because they too had a falling out with them later on.)<br><br>I joined the PPC partly because I thought incidents of this nature wouldn&#39;t happen here. I should&#39;ve understood that I was dead wrong, especially knowing the nature of communities in general, but at the same time I also know that we&#39;re not the kind of people to stoop as low as the ones who publicly humiliated me on dA. That&#39;s more than I can for, personally; I just hope we can do better in the future, and I certainly hope the disaster last March will be the last bit of drama I&#39;ll be forced to witness for a good long while.<br><br>I&#39;ve been getting that feeling about us a lot lately, come to think of it. Perhaps it&#39;s just because I&#39;m still a little enraged and disappointed at how things have been these past few months, though.</p>

            <p>The way I see it, the majority of the community seems passive on these matters, unwilling to put their big-boy/girl/nonconforming boots on and dive in. Other times, helping seems like an arduous task. My second post on the Board was about my need to feel like I&#39;m contributing, but it took a great act of will for me to even type this. This is why I propose the following command structure:<br><br>*A handful of people to be elected Community Managers. Those in this position are responsible for calling votes, approving proposals for the community, and if worst comes to worst, banning members.<br><br>*Several minor community roles are to be created. These roles may be things like running weekly CAHQ games or teaching the ropes to newbies. Roles should be simple things that make our community feel more like a community. Everyone who has been around for a few months is encouraged to take up a role.<br><br>*Some representatives. Those who do not wish to partake in votes or discussions can instead put their support behind representatives. Representatives vote on behalf of their supporters. This is far from ideal, but as-is we have a rather large participation problem, and need to grease the wheels in some way.<br></p>

            <p>First, I&#39;m not sure if the call for Community Managers is a proposal for moderators under a different name or something akin to <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=307716;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">Delta&#39;s suggestion downthread</a>. On the assumption that it&#39;s the latter, I&#39;m going to set out what I think you&#39;re asking for in more detail.<br><br>The proposal is that we should elect a group of Community Managers. On issues of community management (should X be banned? should X be given One Last Chance? should X be given a very stern collective warning? and so on) consensus among the Community Managers constitutes a decision by the community <i>unless objected to</i>. If people object to the decision, there&#39;s something controversial about it and we need to have a full vote. <br><br>This, of course, doesn&#39;t mean that non-Community Managers should stay out of community management (making proposals, voting on them, etc.), and certainly doesn&#39;t mean that everyone else loses their responsibility for calling out bad behavior. Heck, if everyone stayed away from that stuff, we wouldn&#39;t have any data with which to pick new community managers for if some the old ones leave.<br><br>What seem to be the arguments for this system is that we&#39;re basically doing it already, except we don&#39;t admit to it, and that, right now, the de facto Community Managers can&#39;t do anything without a long, arduous process of getting people to actually vote. Also, the current system means that issues that are important but not outrage-generating or controversial tend to never get resolved because not enough people feel bothered to do something about them, which is bad.<br><br>My personal thoughts on what I proposed above is that I hope we don&#39;t need to do it, but I fear that we do. I&#39;m not currently planning to campaign for this, but if people seem to think it needs to happen, count me as a supporter.<br><br>As to minor roles, I don&#39;t think we need to formalize that stuff to any major degree. However, it might be a good idea to keep a list somewhere of community things we tend to do (unless we&#39;ve already done this and I just haven&#39;t noticed), just in case someone would like to get things moving but is low on creative ideas.<br><br>As to proxy votes, I&#39;m opposed. From what I can imagine, proxy votes (especially what we&#39;ll probably end up with, which is revocable proxy votes, where you can have someone vote for you in general, but take back your support on particular issues) will basically create the Community Managers proposal above, but worse. One problem is that you can only hand out a proxy once, which makes the group of proxy vote holders smaller than the hypothetical group of Community Managers. Another that you have serious liveness problems since it&#39;s really hard to decide who&#39;s a member around here. For example, if I had Laburnum&#39;s proxy for some reason, everyone would probably agree that that&#39;s completely pointless, since she&#39;s not around anymore. But where do you draw the line? That veers into a thorny patch of meta-questions no one actually wants to answer in a rigid way, so let&#39;s not do it.<br><br>- Tomash</p>

            <p>The idea of Community Managers operating under a Rule of Common Non-Objection seems like it would allow us to get much more done as a community without betraying our basic democratic model. Also not 10000% sure we need them, but if other people feel it&#39;s necessary, count me a supporter of the general concept.<br><br>Two ways I can see this going wrong:<br>1. How much objection constitutes enough to call for a full vote? I know, one person should be enough, but. . . what if it&#39;s a ban vote and the only person objecting is the person being banned? I think that should count as consensus. . . but actually, now that I think of it, most people who get banned leave voluntarily (e.g. you -- except for this thread, those <a href="https://technodann.github.io/PPC-board-2.0/archive/2014/11a.html#post-135302">Sheep and zdimensia</a> fellows). Basically, this is the difference between a regular ban and an IP ban. <br>2. Community Managers <i>must</i> conduct all their negotiations and debates on the Board once an issue has been brought before the entire community, or if they receive something relevant via another medium, they must post a copy or screenshot (or at least synopsis) to the Board. Otherwise this could very much turn community discussions into moderator discussions.<br><br>I also think it&#39;s going to be very important to emphasize that participation by non-Community Managers is encouraged. We could make a protocol where threads could be titled, &quot;Community Action Needed: [subject]&quot; and begin with a brief description about how the Community Managers system works (e.g. Subject: Community Action Needed: 7.65x54R (aka Sheep)&#39;s Behavior. Body: It has been brought to my attention that 7.65x54R has been violating the Constitution by flaming and posting NSFW material without warning. We need to decide as a community what to do about this. If there is no objection to what the Community Monitors (me, X, and Y) think should be done, we&#39;ll do that; if anyone has any objection (even you, newbies!), the whole community will vote. Here&#39;s my thoughts: [begin discussion]).<br><br>I&#39;m also in support of not formalizing minor roles, and of making a list. As it stands now, it&#39;s kind of like if the Wiki didn&#39;t list whether characters were free-to-use or who owned them. I had no idea until <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=308349;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">recently</a> that hS wasn&#39;t in charge of Fill the Plothole. <br><br>Also I agree that proxy votes would be messy and complicated, and that we should not do it.<br><br>--Key, procrastinating on writing <s>five</s> four(!) papers</p>

            <p>It might be worth thinking about setting the requirement to consensus among the Community Managers and one other person, so as to prevent an excess of groupthink among those elected. I suspect finding one more person to weigh is something that wouldn&#39;t be much of a problem, On the other hand, I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;d have any effect on the groupthink that may-or-may-not otherwise take hold. I&#39;m just tossing random thoughts out there.<br><br>I&#39;d also like to point out that we used something like this procedure (a few influential people and a few newer people in favor of a ban + a lack of objections) in the <a href="https://technodann.github.io/PPC-board-2.0/archive/2014/11a.html#post-135302">Rifle Caliber Guy case (references to NSFW stuff in parts of the surrounding thread)</a>, so it&#39;s not like this is completely unprecedented.<br><br>- Tomash</p>

I feel it is fair to allow everyone a chance (ie, a day) to state their own side of the issue before people begin replying to it.<br><br>Final note: in the list below, one person has three behaviours listed under their name. This should not be taken to indicate that there is a higher chance of them needing action taken against them, but simply that multiple non-overlapping actions needed covering. In other cases, as many actions were deemed close enough to cover under a single header. It&#39;s filing, that&#39;s all.<br><br><hr>
<br><br><b><u>Ekyl</u></b><br><br><b>Behaviour for Discussion</b>: It is claimed that Ekyl was asked to beta a specific aspect of a story, but that during the course of writing he extended this to betaing the entire story, and forced the author to incorporate his ideas, including stylistic changes. This behaviour was described several times as bullying.<br><br><b>Actions Taken</b>:  Ekyl offered an apology for &#39;coming off that way&#39;. He did not offer an apology for his actions at any point. He defended all of his actions, at most allowing in some posts that he might have been over-enthusiastic.<br><br><b>Comments from Concilliary</b>: Bad betaing practice is not something that should be subject to discipliniary action. Bullying is a serious problem which has not been dealt with well historically.<br><br><b>Link</b>: <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=283792;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">Discussion of Ekyl&#39;s behaviour</a><br><br><b>Behaviour for Discussion</b>: It is claimed that Ekyl has engaged in a pattern of manipulative behaviour. Specific comments have been made that his apologies have at times come across as inauthentic/insincere, that his reaction to the accusations made last month (regarding the previous issue above) was disingenuous/did not respect the gravity of the situation, and that he was manipulating the discussion of JulyFlame in the Discord to encourage the witch-hunt while maintaining plausible deniability.<br><br><b>Actions Taken</b>: None, so far as I know.<br><br><b>Comments from Concilliary</b>: &#39;Backsliding&#39; is possible to forgive if it looks like someone is trying. If you have an issue with an apology, you should address them when it is given.<br><br><b>Link</b>: <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=306497;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">This post</a> links to the chat logs, which covers all three of the above points (since one of the apologies highlighted was made in the Discord at the time).<br><br><b>Behaviour for Discussion</b>: It is claimed that Ekyl has repeatedly felt he has the right to intellectual ownership of various portions of the PPC canon/other ideas, and that even when he has not done anything with those ideas, he has taken offence at others doing so, even when there was no way for them to be aware of his perceived ownership.<br><br><b>Actions Taken</b>: None.<br><br><b>Comments from Concilliary</b>: None; most do not accept the abstract idea of this taking place. One comment that if you make a claim of this kind, you need to maintain it or lose it.<br><br><b>Link</b>: <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=283792;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">The link from the first point</a> includes an accusation of this, with the posts before and after it including some of Ekyl&#39;s thoughts on his relationship to the DIA. It should be noted at this point for context that Ekyl has written relatively little published fiction using the DIA; the only piece I can see is <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LVJNPyS453LCio5R6uxddmhJI-MzbdzBnDznXqhkrIk/edit">this one</a>, though there may be more.<br><hr>
<br><b><u>Nord Ronnoc</u></b><br><br><b>Behaviour for Discussion</b>: It is claimed that Nord Ronnoc engaged inabusive behaviour towards another PPC member some years in the past (possibly before one or both of them joined the PPC), including stalking, emotional abuse, and attempted plagiarism. None of this behaviour is said to have taken place in PPC community spaces; however, Nord Ronnoc is said to have tried to treat it all as brushed under the carpet, and interact in a friendly fashion with the reported victim (without engaging in harassment/stalking).<br><br><b>Actions Taken</b>: Portions of the claimed chain of events were discussed on the IRC, with the reported victim admitting to acting angrily. An IRC moderator attempted to calm the reported victim down. It is not known whether any action was taken against Nord Ronnoc, but it has been stated that they have not apologised. The most recent reported incident between the two took place in 2015.<br><br><b>Comments from Concilliary</b>: This kind of issue should be dealt with on a case-by-case basis.<br><br><b>Link</b>: None, as this is an IRC/elsewhere discussion. As reported to me, Nord Ronnoc has not behaved badly in the PPC itself.<br><hr>
<br><b><u>Granz the Ice Cream Monarch</u></b><br><br><b>Behaviour for Discussion</b>: While the PPC community was discussing banning a number of Discord regulars, including Granz, Granz created a new PPC Discord server to get around the prospective ban. He stated that this was open to everybody, and that it was a response to the ban proposal.<br><br><b>Actions Taken</b>: The server was protested by several people on the Discord, and apparently shut down shortly thereafter.<br><br><b>Comments from Concilliary</b>: Several people feel strongly that this kind of behaviour should be treated as a reaction to events in the PPC, and that those causes should be addressed rather than the attempted splitting of the community.<br><br><b>Links</b>: <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=307787;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">This post</a> confirms Granz&#39;s involvement. Granz&#39;s most relevant comment on motives from the Discord discussion seems to be: &quot;I am trying to say that this kind of mass ban is unjust and also cannot work&quot;.<br><hr>
<br><b><u>Scapegrace</u></b><br><br><b>Behaviour for Discussion</b>: It is claimed that Scapegrace has a pattern of behaviour wherein she will engage in bad behaviour (verbal attacks being specifically noted), apologise, but then engage in the same behaviour again after a period without it, with no consequences for this.<br><br><b>Actions Taken</b>: Apologies by Scapegrace after specific incidents, usually very quickly after the incident.<br><br><b>Comments from Concilliary</b>: No-one really calling for disciplinary action; most comments focus on mediation between two people specifically, rather than one individual engaging with multiple others.<br><br><b>Links</b>: <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=283834;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">An example from 2015</a>, <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=306519;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">and one from this year</a>.<br><hr>
<br><u><b>Huinesoron &amp; Neshomeh</b></u><br><br><b>Behaviour for Discussion</b>: It is claimed that they are in some way able to direct the course of discussion in the PPC, including both preventing people they like from being banned, and forcing people they don&#39;t like out. It is also claimed that they silence or otherwise stop discussion of issues, preventing their resolution.<br><br><b>Actions Taken</b>: None.<br><br><b>Comments from Concilliary</b>: General feeling that this doesn&#39;t happen.<br><br><b>Links</b>: No specific incidents have been pointed out. <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=306504;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">This post</a> contains an excerpted Discord log making the claim. <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=307607;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">This one</a> makes a related claim<br><hr>
<br><u><b>Multiple Discord Users</b></u><br><br><b>Behaviour for Discussion</b>: It is claimed that multiple Discord users engaged in a &#39;witch-hunt&#39; against JulyFlame in the Discord. A group-thinking anti-JulyFlame mentality has been identified several times as a potential cause, as well as a lack of awareness that feelings do not equal facts (ie, it is claimed the approach of &quot;there&#39;s no smoke without fire&quot; was taken against JulyFlame).<br><br><b>Actions Taken</b>: Nothing coherent. Yes, there was a <i>lot</i> of discussion about this, but the subject of bans got taken over by the doxxing discussion. Outside of &#39;ban everybody&#39;, the only proposals were vague things about how people needed to think about what they did. I don&#39;t know what discussion there&#39;s been on the Discord, but I don&#39;t feel that there was any organised discussion of what the behaviour associated with the <i>witch-hunt</i> (as opposed to the doxxing) brought to light. (I&#39;m saying a lot more words here because it&#39;s not as simple a question as the others.)<br><br><b>Comments from Concilliary</b>: A vague feeling that bearing grudges over things that happened years back/that the person has tried to change is bad.<br><br><b>Link</b>: In lieu of linking to the whole discussion, <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?id=199610;article=306611">this</a> is PoorCynic&#39;s post where he tries to identify who the drivers behind the witch-hunt were. His list specifically highlights Tomash, Alleb, Granz, Khrssty, Aegis, and Ekyl. I would also like to point out Seafarer&#39;s <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=306444;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">post here</a>, which cited a troll and <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=306581;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">the person behind that troll</a> as evidence against July, which speaks to the confirmation bias/groupthink aspect.<br><br><hr>
<br><br>Again, a reminder to please allow 24 hours for the people named to reply. After that point, if you want to step forward as being the/a person who raised the issue, you may (but don&#39;t have to); please don&#39;t name <i>someone else</i> as doing so, however.<br><br>And no chucking people&#39;s personal information around.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p><b>Ekyl:</b> I refuse to comment on this behaviour, as it has been adequately covered elsewhere. There is also a simple conflict of interest in that I don&#39;t actually <i>like</i> him.<br><br><b>Nord Ronnoc:</b> I don&#39;t know about the other two charges here, but I can definitely by the harassment charge. I distinctly remember Nord badgering people heavily on the Discord to look through his milsci <i>Mass Effect</i> fic and offer concrit; indeed, I offered some of my own over voice chat, even though I was at pains to point out that that sort of fiction is very definitely not my wheelhouse. I don&#39;t think it was entirely malicious, instead merely an overzealous approach to acquiring concrit from disinterested parties.<br><br><b>Granz:</b> This was a stupid idea, as anyone who remembers PPC2 can tell you about. This was really, really dumb to anyone who remembers that part of history. Granz <i>didn&#39;t</i>. He wasn&#39;t around for any of that, and neither was I, and all I had to go on was various cryptic messages from people like JulyFlame and Desdendelle and VixenMage and other oldbies. This isn&#39;t to defend his actions; however, again, I don&#39;t think this was actively malicious. If memory serves, and it may well not, Granz was trying to prove a point to counter Desdendelle&#39;s little &quot;ban everyone who has said the word Discord since last August&quot; temper tantrum, that being that a mass ban would simply cause the community of those banned to reform their own discord and associate with each other like that. This was a stupid thing to do, but I think longstanding Boarders with long memories of the various drama outbreaks that happened here let their alarm bells ring a little too hard.<br><br><b>NeshomehS:</b> <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=308196;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">&quot;[T]he reason it looks like Neshomeh and I always get our way is because <b>we&#39;re actually willing to speak up</b>.&quot;</a> <i>A</i> reason. Not the only one. Newbies see oldbie posts less as invitations to dialogue and more as pronouncements from on high; by way of evidence, I ask you to think about the awe you felt when a PPC BNF was <i>talking<i> to <i>you eeeee</i> back when you both first joined. This isn&#39;t your fault, nor is it entirely your problem, but it&#39;s something we all need to bear in mind.<br><br><b>The Discord Hive:</b> Witch-hunting was and remains deeply wrong. We are not in the business of conducting ideological purges. That said, I don&#39;t think this was anything other than an angry mob. Outrage happens in fits and starts, it burns brighter than the stars... but then it fades away, leaving ashen resentment in its stead, and all those involved saw that it was wrong and wanted to return to how things had normally been. Therein lies the biggest problem with the PPC community; it is not our willingness to make the place a garden, but wishful thinking saying that it already is. <i>This</i> is something that we need to combat, far more than any Culture Of Bullying.<br><br><b>And Finally, Me:</b> I get frustrated very easily; as I have often pointed out to myself and to others, that is a reason for my actions, not an excuse. Between the stupid drama on the Board and my paranoia flaring up like a dying sun (it is triggered by, of all the stupid things, my parents&#39; house), I have not been in a charitable mood. Recusing myself from this discussion was mostly based on not wanting to say anything I regretted; this was an act of cowardice and one totally at odds with my goals of giving this all a positive outcome. The simple fact of it is I didn&#39;t <i>want</i> to engage with this side of the community. I&#39;m more comfortable on the fringes and in the peanut gallery. This is cowardice. This has to stop. But it probably won&#39;t, because behaviours have inertia just like masses do.</i></i></p>

            <p>Your statement that &#39;nor is it entirely your problem&#39; suggests to me that it&#39;s at least partly my (/our) problem, and that means I should take some part in dealing with it. Do you have any suggestions as to how I might do that?<br><br>For the record: I was very new to the PPC when Thalia Weaver&#39;s actions sparked a massive row. As it happens, Kaitlyn has preserved the fact that not only did I enter into the debate, I did so with a position which I felt was at odds with the Board as a whole, and which would likely lead to me being attacked.

            <p>This is, by the way, directed at the group, not just Scapegrace (though Scape&#39;s points brought this to mind).<br><br>We seem to be talking about an interplay between &quot;Oldbies&quot; and &quot;Newbies&quot;.  I can&#39;t argue that &quot;Oldbies&quot; don&#39;t speak with the authority of experience.  I also can&#39;t argue that &quot;Newbies&quot; don&#39;t quickly pick up on and follow that.  These are things that I don&#39;t think are fixable.<br><br>My question, and possible way to a solution, is this:  Where&#39;s everyone who isn&#39;t an &quot;Oldbie&quot; or a &quot;Newbie&quot;?  What part do they play in this?  We&#39;ve forgotten the middle half of the community, and I think they are important.  They bridge the gap between the other two groups.<br><br>Think about it.  They remember what it is like to be new and in awe, but they&#39;ve been around long enough to realize that &quot;Oldbies&quot; are just people.  It makes sense that they should be the fulcrum upon which the scales balance.<br><br>The reason I think we&#39;ve forgotten this group, despite half the community falling into it, is that we never had it before.  Do you know what we used to call people who&#39;d been around for a couple of years?  Oldbies.  Now, what an &quot;Oldbie&quot; is has shifted and the gap between &quot;Oldbie&quot; and &quot;Newbie&quot; has grown, but we&#39;ve forgotten that the gap isn&#39;t empty.  It&#39;s full of Scapegraces and Allebs and Hieronymus Graubarts and KittyEdens.<br><br>I think the &quot;Middlebies&quot; are the solution, but it is going to require them to take more ownership of the community.  Be more invested.  Answer &quot;Newbie&quot; questions.  Question &quot;Oldbies&quot; when they say something you disagree with.<br><br>This is your community, too.  You have a voice.

            <p>Unless I&#39;m misremembering, the pile of middlebies who hang out here but stay away from the big stuff has been a feature of the PPC for ... about as long as I&#39;ve been here.<br><br>I&#39;m pretty sure you could have made this post in, say, September 2011, and all you would&#39;ve needed to do is use different names such as Tomash and Shoe. <br><br>So, this seems to be a long-standing problem. I worry this might just be something fundamental about how humans act in groups, and I&#39;d gladly be proven wrong. I think it would help the community if people wouldn&#39;t do what I did back in the day and stay far back, only tossing in a quick vote on any concrete proposals once the dust has settled.

            <p>There used to not be a gap, as I see it.  You kinda graduated straight from &quot;newbie&quot; to &quot;oldbie&quot; when you decided you weren&#39;t a &quot;newbie&quot; anymore.  And that&#39;s actually why I use the quotation marks around those terms.  There is no concrete rule for what makes someone an &quot;oldbie&quot;.  It&#39;s all perception.<br><br>My general thinking on what each term means is this (and not at all a thing anyone needs to take as gospel truth):<br><br>Newbies are members of the community that preface posts with things like &quot;I know I haven&#39;t been here very long, but...&quot; or some such.

            <p>When you said &quot;oldbies&quot;, I thought of what I&#39;m now going  to call the &quot;disputes group&quot;. The disputes group are the PPCers who tend to non-trivially (more than casting a quick &quot;yeah, that seems good&quot; on other people&#39;s votes etc.) participate in calling people out, discussions about community standards like this one, and so on. (To give an example, you and Scapegrace are both rather squarely in the disputes group from what I can remember). My post was encouraging more people to join that group, since there seems to be a general perception that it&#39;s a bit small.<br><br>Also, by what I think your standards are, the latest date you can put on when I became an &quot;oldbie&quot; was June 2012, when I started working on T-Board. <br><br>Oh, and, hey middlebies!

            <p>I&#39;ve been around the PPC since August of 2014, so perhaps that makes me a &quot;Middlebie&quot; of sorts too. In that time I&#39;ve seen a number of debates, but most of the once I participated in involved newbies not yet understanding how to ingratiate themselves into our community as well as the rest of us do. A few have gone off the deep end and either left on their own volition or, in one or two rare cases, gotten themselves outright banned. This may have clouded my perception and skewed it somewhat in the favor of newbies, because speaking as someone who&#39;s caused trouble with online groups before due to both lack of familiarity and a massively inflated teenage ego, I can sympathize more with being new than being old, as it were.<br><br>With this in mind, it took me a while to start realizing that being an &quot;oldbie&quot; does not automatically make you a voice of authority. Nor does it guarantee that you&#39;ll be welcome - look what happened with JulyFlame and Desdendelle. In fact, it was the massive flock-fest this past March that led me to realize that the people who&#39;ve been around for as long as these two, or hS, or Nesh, or others whom we regard as &quot;oldbies&quot; have burdens of their own. I&#39;m awful at pointing fingers at anyone and certainly won&#39;t do so here - we all make mistakes after all - but I can now say that these burdens have been ignored for too long simply because nobody considered speaking up against what we all thought were &quot;voices of authority&quot; - I&#39;m pretty sure anyone who considered it worried that such an action would lead to the community turning against them for opposing a well-respected community member. This same mentality may explain why people are too scared to stand up to oppressive leaders in politics, challenge the views of eminent thinkers, or openly call out celebrities on their poor behavior.<br><br>This has to stop. Right now.<br><br>I&#39;ve lived under the roof of a family who&#39;s been controlling myself and my brother for over two decades now. I obviously owe it to my parents for shaping me into the person that I am today, and if it weren&#39;t for their love and guidance I wouldn&#39;t have gotten my graduate degrees, or managed to get myself employed in the first place. That doesn&#39;t change the fact that both of them aren&#39;t that good at parenting, though - a doting mother who struggles to address our problems effectively, and a father who, as he himself has apologetically lampshaded, has been known to put too much &quot;tough&quot; into &quot;tough love&quot;. I&#39;ve tried to speak up and try to get them both to improve, but for the gods&#39; sake, they&#39;re my <i>parents</i>. Talking back to your parents is a societal no-no, even if it&#39;s for their good and your own. And so the struggles continue. Perhaps my analogy for the whole &quot;Oldbies vs. Newbies&quot; interaction is not a good one - though our community is very much like family, every PPC boarder is still an independent thinker. But for my taste, I&#39;m very much seeing a sort of an extended family dynamic among all of us on the Board, and while I can&#39;t speak for anyone else, I can&#39;t help but think that it&#39;s become so dysfunctional in light of the events this past March, a feeling which is both depressing and downright cringeworthy.<br><br>I still feel I should&#39;ve spoken up sooner, and I&#39;m pretty sure most if not all of the &quot;Middlebies&quot; feel the same way. But if the Newbies don&#39;t know enough to point out things that long-running members need to improve upon, let alone problems that have plagued the community as a whole for so long, then that leaves us and us alone as the ones to speak up. And speak up we should - as soon as we possibly can. If there&#39;s one thing this community needs, it&#39;s damage control, and perhaps us &quot;Middlebies&quot; may be exactly that - the mediating forces that can help restore the PPC community&#39;s collective sense of being one big, happy Internet family.</p>

            <p>So, when it comes to the stuff you usually do, like the PPC Hunger Games or the Friday Forums, you not only wouldn&#39;t object to people taking them over from you, but would be happy if they did? <br><br>If someone were taking something that&#39;s &quot;yours&quot; (in the &quot;people think of this as hS&#39;s thing&quot; sense), would you prefer they get in touch with you first or just go for it?<br><br>On a general note, as I said in a different context downthread, folks, this current state of affairs is very unfair to hS. We&#39;re starting to treat him as a near-infinite source of &quot;keep the PPC running&quot; juice (or at least it&#39;s starting to feel that way), and, as he pointed out, that&#39;s not what he is. I don&#39;t want to see a &quot;why I&#39;m leaving the PPC&quot; from hS because he&#39;s sick and tired of dealing with our crap, and I&#39;m worried that&#39;s the path we&#39;re headed down.

            <p>First, what you&#39;ve said here isn&#39;t &quot;mostly useless&quot;. Among other things, the middlebie perspective hasn&#39;t been brought up in this thread much at all, and it&#39;s a useful perspective that needs to be more exposed. Thank you for making this comment.<br><br>On Granz, I also agree that he wasn&#39;t doing anything malicious. I do have to admit that it set off more or less all the alarm bells (it was, after all, a second chat with implications of it being an anti-July thing, given why the initial ban list had been posted).<br><br>On oldbie posts being seen as pronouncements instead of invitations for discussion, I agree that this is a thing and that we need to keep in mind that it happens. In fact, it&#39;s been a thing for about as long as I&#39;ve been in the PPC (if not longer). I know because I did when I was newer. For example, about seven months after I joined, there was a big blow-up about #PPC2 and bad behavior in the IRC generally. I stayed <i>way</i> away from the discussion (the only comment I made was a vote of support for Delta&#39;s proposed IRC rules). I can&#39;t for the life of my remember why I didn&#39;t contribute. If i had to guess, I&#39;d say I it was a combination of the problem you identified and feeling that everyone had already said what needed saying.<br><br>I can&#39;t think of anything we can do about this other than try to keep in mind (newbies and oldbies both) that it happens with an eye towards minimizing it.<br><br>I&#39;m not entirely sure what you meant when you talked about &quot;wishful thinking saying that [the PPC] already is [a garden]&quot;. Did you mean that we have a problem with optimistically thinking everyone&#39;s friends here and that there&#39;s no need to change anything? Is there anything in particular you think we&#39;ve seeing through collective rose-tinted glasses?<br><br>Scape, recognizing that you were liable to say something you might regret and then taking some time out until that became less true is, I claim, a good and reasonable thing to do.<br><br>I also understand wanting to stay out of the drama and politics. It&#39;s not fun (for me, at least. Apparently there are people who like this sort of thing?). However, as I&#39;ve realized after way too long, this stuff is important to keeping this place from going up in flames, so someone has to be doing it. So, if you&#39;d like to become one of the Involved (as it were), I expect we&#39;d be glad to have you. (Obviously, this is your choice etc.)<br><br>- Tomash</p>

<li>Handle disputes promptly, as calmly as possible, and always on the Board. <br><br>2. Make it clear in writing, and as part of newbie orientation, that disputes are never discussed on the chat. Also, no one who is not present is discussed, even in a positive light (such as discussion of liking a mission when the writer is not present). And to be aware of what you are saying in other forms of private conversations, along the lines of what Phobos said way down thread.<br><br>*Would there need to be an exception for discussing missions by people who are no longer here, or very old missions in context of PPC history, especially as it pertains to a person&#39;s current agents?<br><br>3. Make the chat logs publicly accessible (somewhere, somehow I&#39;m not a computer person, so I have no idea on how to accomplish this).<br><br>I think folks who never go to chat and have been talked about on chat behind their backs need to have easy access to the logs, to regain their trust in that section of the PPC, but it will also help anyone who chats who says there is a pattern of problems happening, since not everyone archives the chat logs for themselves. This bleeds into:<br><br>4. Make sure everyone knows that what happens in chat is entirely as public as this Board.<br><br><br>I don&#39;t know.

            <p>First, I&#39;d like to reiterate a point I made further down the thread. We&#39;ve voted against mods. This means that everyone is responsible for participating in complaint resolution, not just the three-four of us that have actually said things in this thread. If you (collectively) are unwilling to do that (I&#39;m not convinced this is the case, mind you) can we just cut to the chase and hold a mod election?<br><br>Now, to be fair to us, the Bram thread above did have somewhat broader participation for some reason, so it&#39;s possible there are things about this thread that have dampened participation (or, conversely, there are things about the Bram thread that have encouraged participation).<br><br>So, without further ado, a few observations:<br><br>1. For a lot of these things (Granz, the witch-hunt (sort of), etc.) those accused have spoken up, admitted fault, and apologized. The accusers (which, in a lot of these instances, are us, collectively) seem to have accepted these apologies as sufficient, so there&#39;s not much more to be said. If you think this is insufficient dispute resolution in any instance, please go complain now.<br><br>1b. People haven&#39;t been pressing their claims, so there&#39;s not much to discuss. The main example I have here is Scapegrace. People accused Scape of engaging in a pattern of bad behavior and not getting called on it. Then, hS and Nesh said (by omission) that there wasn&#39;t anything punishable about that pattern, since Scape seems to be improving, it&#39;s caused by a loss of control, etc. The people who wanted Scape called out haven&#39;t disputed this sentiment. So, if you think there&#39;s still something that needs to be done about Scape&#39;s behavior, please speak up now.<br><br>This also goes for some of the other accusations, such as the witch-hunt or even Ekyl.<br><br>2. In some of these cases, there aren&#39;t clear heroes and villains . Either the person who did something wrong has apologized, admitted fault, and so on (see above) or it&#39;s unclear who, if anyone, did anything wrong. If it&#39;s unclear what needs to happen or who did something bad, that doesn&#39;t mean you should stay out of the thread. Get in there and try to move things forward. For example, if you want more details, <i>ask for them</i>. If you want something clarified, ask!<br><br>So, yeah, if you want something fixed (even if it wasn&#39;t on the original list) either participate in that process or accept the fixes (or non-fixes) the people who did post decided on. If you do stay out of this one, though, kindly please don&#39;t accuse hS, Nesh, or me of being railroading dictators after the fact.<br><br>- Tomash</p>

            <p>I will be putting up analyses of the various points made by hS over the course of the next couple of days.

            <p>Alright, so first I&#39;m going to try and describe all the historical stuff (and include a few suggestions)<br><br>- Back in 2013, Herr harassed Nord over PM in the IRC. He&#39;s apologized for this. As far as I know, he hasn&#39;t done this since and isn&#39;t planning to. So, I think the apology should do it<br><br>- Nord allegedly stalked HerrWazzek, one component of which was a like/retweet spree (?) on Herr&#39;s Twitter back in 2015.  If this was after a (mutual or otherwise) &quot;I don&#39;t want to talk to you again (or have you trying to get my attention)&quot;, then some sort of apology for the accident in question is probably in order, if it hasn&#39;t already been offered. (Obviously, if any of those &quot;if&quot;s aren&#39;t true, my suggestion might not be applicable) <br><br>- Herr has posted about Nord&#39;s [something, [Redacted. ~NA]] on the Board without Nord&#39;s consent. Herr has, in the past, used that information in order to level accusations against Nord, possibly in a harassing way. Herr, what you did there isn&#39;t right (especially since [something] wasn&#39;t common knowledge here), and you owe Nord an apology.<br><br>- There was a dustup about a fic Nord posted, which has since been deleted. Herr says that Nord either ripped off, if not plagiarized, a fic Herr wrote (which is different from the Herr/Nord collaboration?) or said he planned to do those things. Herr would like an apology for that in either case.<br><br>- Herr and Nord collaborated on a fic. After their falling out, Nord reposted the fic, but eventually took it down at Herr&#39;s request. Nord then drew on the ideas in this deleted fic to write his own work. No one seems to have a problem with this.<br><br>- Herr, when accusing Nord of bad behavior, gave as an example a time he make a joking death threat and Nord didn&#39;t quite take it as a joke. Herr, I&#39;d like to remind you that it&#39;s really hard to convey tone over text, especially if your joke isn&#39;t obviously one and you don&#39;t use some sort of marker (the way you write, emotes, certain words, etc.) to indicate you&#39;re not serious. Furthermore, joking death threats are, like Nesh said, Not Cool.<br><br>- Herr alleges that Nord has [allowed/encouraged/I&#39;m not even sure] his (Nord&#39;s) family to harass him (Herr) about things he (Herr) said, and to threaten Herr into becoming Nord&#39;s friend in the first place. It is unclear what, if anything, Herr wants to happen here.<br><br>Based on all that, it looks like Herr and Nord have (like hS said) some valid complaints against each other, generally about things that happened a good while back and/or outside of the PPC. I suggest that, after we finish these discussions, Herr and Nord should stay away from each other and not try to get each other&#39;s attention. That&#39;s the best course of action for the both of them, from what I can tell.<br><br>Now, Herr has accused Nord of a pattern of bad behavior. I&#39;m going to focus on the intersection of that with the PPC and detail what I think are the elements of that accusation (if I&#39;m misstating the alleged problem, let me know), which are that Nord has, <i>in PPC spaces</i>:<br><br>- Done bad things<br><br>- Used [something that was redacted [Redacted.~NA]] as an <i>excuse</i> for doing those bad things. That is, that he&#39;s declared that he shouldn&#39;t have to apologize or otherwise face consequences because of [whatever was redacted]<br><br>- Made no significant effort to improve his behavior or otherwise manage [whatever the redacted stuff was]<br><br>I don&#39;t recall any of these elements happening here in the PPC. If that&#39;s just my faulty memory, I&#39;d appreciate something more concrete to remind me about this stuff (Board posts, logs, specific descriptions, what have you). I&#39;m not going to suggest anything be done at this time because it&#39;s unclear that there&#39;s anything to do something about.<br><br>If, instead, the pattern of behavior happened a few years ago elsewhere on the Internet (with maybe a brief pop-up here in the form of the 2013 IRC thing), and especially if it has stopped since then, then there&#39;s nothing to be done, I think. (Well, <i>maybe</i> Nord could acknowledge past wrongdoing, assuming the accusations are accurate, but I don&#39;t think there&#39;s anything about this situation that we need to take Action (tm) on if I&#39;ve described it accurately in this paragraph.)</p>

            <p>I find myself unable to move on to write a fluffy interlude while I just let this simmer unresolved.<br><br><b>Herr Wozzeck</b>, I don&#39;t think you have been singled out for unfair treatment. I see how difficult it is to talk about a complaint when we can only talk in such vague words. But disclosing  information that violates privacy was a bad move, especially when we just had this big crisis about that and all agreed that it shouldn&#39;t happen ever again. <br><br><b>Nord</b>, why are you furious? You used what-I-don&#39;t-know-because-it-was-redacted-before-I-could-see-it as an excuse, so you depended on it being known; otherwise, how would that excuse have worked? I&#39;ve actually not seen you doing this, but I have not seen you denying it here, so it happened and I don&#39;t need further evidence that would reveal personal information. Maybe you didn&#39;t intend to use this excuse here and thus didn&#39;t want <i>us</i> to know (which would show actual progress from the olden times), so being disappointed or even angra I might understand, but furious is a strong word. Anyway, I hope we have made sufficiently clear that we try to be considerate, if we are in the know, but that whatever-may-be-applicable is no excuse for not even trying. <br><br><b>Both of you</b>, from what I can see, we are looking at the fallout of a friendship that may have been forced and turned out to be unhealthy years ago. I don&#39;t know what we can do about that, other than strongly recommend that you continue to ignore each other, like you already started to do. I sincerely hope we don&#39;t need to emphasize our dislike of having this blow up in our faces by adding an &quot;or else&quot;, like we did for Bramandin. <br><br>Actually, it would be nice if you, before continuing the ignoring, could consider Tomash&#39;s suggestion of simultaneous apologies, made below.<br><br>HG</p>

            <p>Nesh, could you expand a bit on why a pair of bans is on the table?<br><br>Now, as to this whole situation, what I&#39;d like to see happen is that both HerrWozzek and Nord Ronnoc swallow their emotions for a bit and apologize for the things they did wrong. Then, they could move back on to ignoring each other, but they&#39;d both have some sense of closure. Unfortunately, there seems to be a &quot;No, <i>you</i> apologize first!&quot; loop going on. One suggestion I have is that, as a compromise, both Herr and Nord could apologize simultaneously. That is, they&#39;d both send their apologies to some neutral third party, who would only pass them on once they&#39;d gotten both of them.<br><br>If that doesn&#39;t work out, Herr and Nord could just ignore each other completely (I understand this is already sort of happening, given that they&#39;ve blocked each other on Discord). I suspect this &quot;solution&quot; won&#39;t leave anyone satisfied. Among other things, it means both parties &quot;got away&quot; with bad behavior. It also makes it more likely that this will explode again later, and that would be rather bad.<br><br>I call on both Herr and Nord to realize that they&#39;ve each done something wrong here (please note, this doesn&#39;t mean that they&#39;re equally bad or anything like that, just that no one&#39;s behavior in this dispute is spotless) and to apologize for their actions (such as they were) and to accept the other party&#39;s apologies like the calm, mature people I&#39;m confident they can be.<br><br>- Tomash</p>

That is, both Herr Wozzeck and Nord Ronnoc should pretend the other doesn&#39;t exist. No talking to them. No referring to them. No slyly hinting at something about them. No discussing them behind their back. No responding to something they posted, no commiserating with others over their faults, no <i>anything</i>. Just utterly ignore them, and don&#39;t get into a situation where that&#39;s not possible.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>...I have a few cents to add to this discussion now. And I have some things to add before I finally pretend he doesn&#39;t exist because, as I figured he would, he omitted several pieces of relevant information.<br><br>&quot;Emotional abuse: I explicitly don&#39;t recall displaying any instance emotional abuse towards him. Most of our conversations prior to the falling out were normal, to my understanding. [I don&#39;t feel that] arguments and discussions, heated at times, count as abuse[...].&quot;<br><br>Funny thing to say, from someone who never stopped his family from bullying me and calling me a horrible person most times I said something he didn&#39;t like. I should also stress that the only reason I became his &quot;friend&quot; in the first place was basically because I was cowed by his mother threatening me with libel over me saying [Personal information removed. ~NA] He claims he never wanted them to, but the fact he never stopped from doing it them says something very different. I would also contend that some of his moral guardianism would count towards that (he was very insistent about not giving death threats when I mentioned scissors in relation to EA&#39;s management with their unrealistically high expectations for Dead Space 3&#39;s release).<br><br>Both of those factors led to me being in a situation where I grew afraid of saying anything that he might take offense to. if I said something too crazy, his moral guardianism would kick in. And if I got too heated, I&#39;d deal with his family. He never stopped doing the former, and he never made any attempt to stop the latter. I think that speaks for itself, really.<br><br>&quot;Plagiarism: It was over a collaboration for his fic series[...]. The collaboration was my idea and the final version[...] differentiate greatly from the collab. Taking inspiration and ideas from the old collaboration doesn&#39;t strike me as plagiarism. [...] After the falling out, and as far as I remember, we made a deal where I would remove said fic (I posted it after he removed it) and he would leave me alone.&quot;<br><br>That is a lie, because that was NEVER what my complaints about plagiarism were about: they were about the fact that, in a journal he posted to DeviantArt post-fallout, he stated intent to rewrite my fanfic Mass Vexations 3. This is notable since he never asked me for my permission to do so (and in fact, had stated in a Facebook PM prior to our falling out that he&#39;d thought of it beforehand), and that it was a potential rewrite of a fic in progress no less. (And I should also clarify: he has since deleted that journal, but contrary to what he believes deleting it doesn&#39;t mean it didn&#39;t happen.) And note that he still hasn&#39;t apologized for this, and from the way he completely misrepresented what my anger was about, it&#39;s clear he still doesn&#39;t see anything wrong with what he did to my fic there. It should also be noted that his abject refusal to see anything wrong with what he did here is what has fueled my anger against him in pretty much every other situation.<br><br>Now, to be fair to him, he didn&#39;t actually follow through with that. But the mere fact that he thought of it (and in a clear bid to get back at me, no less: it&#39;s hard to think of any other reason why he titled the prospective rewrite &quot;Retribution&quot; when such a title would otherwise make no sense for a full sequel) and never apologized for it still angers me to this day, as some friends I talked to about this on the last day of Midwest FurFest pointed out. And on the topic of friends, literally every person I spoke to about this around the time it happened agreed with me that his actions with that journal constituted attempted theft, so I know I&#39;m not crazy here.<br><br>THIS is what he needs to apologize for, NOT the collaboration. And he has not done so, and given how he talks about it even now I doubt he ever will.<br><br>&quot;inciting harassment by dismissing a mental health issue.&quot;<br><br>As far as I remember this was only done in a DeviantArt PM, and that was related to the [Personal information removed. ~NA] that his mother threatened me over. In hindsight, I realize I did go too far with the [Personal information removed. ~NA] accusations, and I&#39;ve avoided doing that since. That said, I don&#39;t know how the hell I would incite harrasment with that when it was over a DeviantArt PM, and that I further never made a whole campaign to decry Nord Ronnoc for that in public.<br><br>I won&#39;t say anything about spamming messages: that was a thing that happened out of frustration that literally nobody else was calling him out for his actions. It doesn&#39;t make it right, however, and for that I apologize.<br><br>At the end of the day, though, this boils down to the exact same thing that we&#39;re dealing with for Bram here: Nord is using [Personal information removed. ~NA] as an excuse not to be a better person than he is. And I&#39;m going to say the same thing that basically the entire PPC community has been saying to Bram: it&#39;s not an excuse. With Nord&#39;s cultural awareness (he&#39;d started to get political at some point before our fallout), he should have more awareness of societal norms, so he cannot use [Personal information removed. ~NA] as a shield with which to deflect people telling him his behavior is shitty.<br><br>Those are my two cents. Now, I&#39;m going to proceed with HS&#39; suggestion that I pretend he doesn&#39;t exist in the present.</p>

<li>The death threat issue mentioned was me being miffed about about EA Games setting unrealistically high sales expectations for the release of Dead Space 3. I had to go way back into the past to find the exact post, but I dug it up. Here&#39;s the text, keeping in mind that the original post was with a link to an article about it from The Escapist:<br><br>&quot;Oh, come on EA! Really? REALLY?<br><br>*groan*<br><br>Well, I&#39;ll be sitting here waiting to stab you in the face when you announce that the Dead Space franchise won&#39;t continue because DS3 never got up to the 5 million copies you want it to.

            <p>could have been named on this list, I want to say that I have had severe anxiety over the PPC for a long, long time, but this Grand Concilliary and all the responses to it have been immensely helpful to my psyche. I am proud of everyone here for taking on a terribly difficult situation with thoughtfulness and care. I haven&#39;t contributed up til now, because I didn&#39;t feel qualified, but I think I am caught up enough now to say a few words.<br><br><br><b>Before I go further, even though I am not on this list, I want to apologize for my part in the incident a few years ago that seems to have lain the foundation for the current problems. I made some pretty big mistakes, and I hurt several people. I am sorry.</b><br><br><br>Someone suggested further down that the chat logs somehow be put onto an archive that is available to everyone. I think this is an excellent idea, though I have no idea how to accomplish it. It would give those who never go to the chat peace of mind and access, and make those who do chat remember that what they say there matters and is public.<br><br>Also, I know the situation between Bramandin and Iximaz hasn&#39;t been pleasant for anyone. I imagine especially coming so close to this thread, but as someone who is essentially an outside observer at this point, everything talked about here worked. It was immediately shut down on the chat and taken to the Board, which has allowed it to be dealt with much more rationally. <br><br>Even though it looks very much like people are still hurting from earlier problems, I think the PPC has a lot to be proud of in the handling of this problem. Seriously, compare it to the last one or even the linked threads in the above discussion. It might not be my place, but I think you all need to hear that you are doing a good job, even the ones who needed a push in the right direction.<br><br>The difference between dealing with a situation on the chat and on the Board is impressive. The Board gives everyone time to think about their responses and the responses of everyone else. Even if they don&#39;t always think about them enough it is much easier to step back and not let it become an echo chamber.  <br><br>I think seeing issues dealt with thoroughly like this new one is will build trust. Trust that things are taken seriously and dealt with rationally will help avoid most of the problems in item 4 below. (Saying trust, I&#39;m maybe speaking more from personal experience as someone who has difficulty trusting others due to past experiences than can apply to others in the PPC, so if anyone feels this last statement is just plain wrong for the group, please take it as only my personal issue)<br><br><b>tl;dr: <br>1. Good job to everyone who worked on this thread and implemented strategies from it in the latest conflict. <br>2. I am sorry for my part in the years ago problems, even if I wasn&#39;t named in this thread.<br>3. I second the idea of creating chat logs that all of the PPC could access.</b></p>

            <p>I&#39;m not the only one who has this problem?!<br><br>I think I agree with you (in my case, this is rather theoretical agreement, since I haven&#39;t really published anything) about saying <i>something</i> being better than saying nothing. That is, even if a small army of &quot;I liked it (nm)&quot; isn&#39;t very helpful (and maybe even, like you said, a bit discouraging), it&#39;s still better than silence, which is what often happens around here. In my comments, I remarked that we don&#39;t have anything like AO3&#39;s &quot;Kudos&quot; button for technical reasons (hm ... I should see about adding that to T-Board), so I think the next-best solution is to make less unacceptable the sort of comment you said you were ashamed to post.<br><br>I also agree that positive concrit is pretty darn hard. Figuring out <i>why</i> you liked something involves non-trivial inspection, and it seems to be harder to inspect the inputs to like than to dislike. (I haven&#39;t the faintest idea about whether this is actually true or why it might be the case.)<br><br>So, if anyone has useful tips on how to generate positive concrit, I (and I expect most of the rest of us) would appreciate seeing them written up for the Board.<br><br>- Tomash</p>

            <p>... can basically be summed up as: &quot;Be better.&quot;<br><br>The Discord attacked July. It did so because it likes Iximaz and saw her hurting, and because it was already primed to dislike July over incidents many years in the past. It collectively succumbed to confirmation bias and &quot;there&#39;s no smoke without fire&quot;. Even those who weren&#39;t actively pushing the &#39;something must be done about July&#39; message - and I accept after some fairly miserable rerereads of the chat log that several people <i>were</i> angling for &#39;this must be investigated&#39;, instead - need to think long and hard about why they let this happen in their presence.<br><br>When Desdendelle <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=306484;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">attacked Iximaz for having a mental illness</a>, I (and others) stepped in and said that was not acceptable. But when people were saying things like &#39;It would be easier to just let the banhammers swing and get JF completely out of the picture before any more damage can be done&#39;, or &#39;[we need to take action against] JF, I think&#39;... people accepted it as part of the conversation.<br><br>Even those who didn&#39;t say it themselves accepted it as part of the discussion, accepted that targetting someone for banning without checking both sides of the story was a <i>valid viewpoint</i>. Which it isn&#39;t, and wasn&#39;t, and  neither voicing it nor accepting it is acceptable behaviour.<br><br>I don&#39;t feel that any bans are appropriate. <i>So far as I know</i>, there haven&#39;t been any similar incidents before or since.<br><br>But if this sort of thing happens again, then yeah, I think anyone who was actively present and didn&#39;t speak up in either incident will need to be considered individually.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>So, from this thread, we seem to have a split on Scapegrace&#39;s behavior. On one side, we have Nesh and hS (and others, probably), who think Scape is sincere in her apologies and genuinely working hard on her control issues (which do appear to be improving). On the other side, we have Ekyl (and probably others), who think that Scape is not actually sorry for anything she does (and is otherwise insincere) and that she keeps repeating the same behavior over and over again (there seems to be an implied &quot;lack of improvement&quot; there).<br><br>This points to a split in the community, and I&#39;d prefer that be avoided. It also looks like this is a case of different people interpreting the same words and actions in noticeably different ways. This makes it seem rather similar to the criticisms leveled at Ekyl in this thread. <br><br>So, I&#39;d like to propose the same thing that happened to Ekyl. That is, someone (either someone who thinks Scape is being insincere or can coherently articulate why her words might be interpreted that way) should give Scape some community-interaction concrit so that she doesn&#39;t accidentally keep building up this negative image of her that some people appear to have (if that&#39;s what&#39;s happening).<br><br>That concrit doesn&#39;t have to be on the Board or otherwise public, but <b>if</b> the community split I described is real (and not just one or two people who don&#39;t like Scape), it should happen.<br><br>- Tomash</p>

            <p>Well. Maybe reminders, technically speaking. But that&#39;s irrelevant. <br><br>First on the titular list would be the apologies. I am sorry for abandoning the Board temporarily at a reasonably critical juncture, but I&#39;ve been busy this past week. During the only opportunities I&#39;ve had to actually respond, my thoughts and level of productivity have been about constructive as a moldy, damp towel. So while I do have thoughts on all of this, phrasing them at the moment is beyond my capabilities. I have no energy whatsoever, and I really don&#39;t know when that&#39;s coming back. <br><br>Secondly, as I have been pinged off-Board and had this pointed out to me, I feel it&#39;s important for me to offer my reasons for my actions in the JulyFlame incident, to do with as you will. <br><br>I believe the only thing I&#39;m guilty of is failing to call for the deletion of the screenshot. I assumed it would be taken down, given that it was actually met with some opposition (Novastorme and Matt Cipher stick out in my memory), and, just like every other assumption I&#39;ve ever made, I regret making it. They&#39;re a bad habit, and I need to stop. <br><br>I don&#39;t regret asking for access to July&#39;s side of the story, because I believe in collecting evidence, and I still believe that&#39;s all I was doing.  At the time I genuinely thought that we&#39;d be looking into the accusations of harassment of PPCers. However, there were obviously mitigating factors that made that investigation impractical at best—not least among said factors, the withdrawal of charges. <br><br>In summary (provided largely because I&#39;m convinced this post couldn&#39;t be mistaken for cogent by a man with an astigmatism squinting from thirty yards away):<br><br>1.) I&#39;m sorry I haven&#39;t been around, I&#39;ve been alternating between frenetic real-life stuff and doldrums that&#39;d make a sloth&#39;s moss-ridden hair curl, and<br><br>B.), or 2.), or II. if you&#39;re feeling fancy, I don&#39;t think I exacerbated the alleged witch hunt against JulyFlame, though I do regret my failure to actually <i>say</i> &quot;Take down that screenshot.&quot; I admit, I thought I really wouldn&#39;t need to. <br></p>

Would you say that is a fair summary?</i><br><br>No, I wouldn&#39;t. At least, that doesn&#39;t accurately represent my intent at the time. <br><br>There were two conditions to my posting the screenshot: July&#39;s permission and an investigation into wrongdoing for me to post it as evidence <i>in.</i> I want to be clear that both conditions would have to have been met in order for me to post it. <br><br>As evidence, I made efforts to obtain JulyFlame&#39;s contact information for the express purposes of asking for her permission. That wouldn&#39;t have mattered to me if I&#39;d planned on posting it regardless.<br><br>On my own quote:<br><br><i>In this case, though, the changes proposed in community standards pretty much state that we need to go after someone, so separating the two issues here is nuanced.</i><br><br>Well, they do. In the form of an orderly and reasoned thread on this Board, and not a witch hunt. I think there&#39;s a difference. <br><br>Firstly, on intents from people inside the conversation: <br>Ekyl wanted to move the conversation into the sphere of rules. He seemed to hold that a discussion of community rules and proceedings was an entirely separate issue from the incident that necessitated the rule change in the first place. I disagreed. <br><br>When I said that separating the two issues was nuanced, I meant that they are difficult to separate. It&#39;s like trying to put up guards against an army you&#39;ve never seen, only, in this case, you don&#39;t even know if that army exists. <br><br>When you&#39;re laying down rules in a community— rules made specifically to avoid a kind of harassment, you have to know exactly what harassment you&#39;re attempting to avoid. In order to discuss that, you have to know what actually happened in the first place, which, in turn, required an investigation. <br><br>And that brings me to my second point—my intent. <br><br>The change in community standards, in that case, would absolutely mandate an investigation into the veracity of claims of harassment. <br><br>But not in a storm of sans-consent posting of private conversations. But what I meant by &quot;go after&quot; was getting in touch with JulyFlame and saying &quot;Hey, can I get your side of the story from you, and would you be willing to share that with the Board? Also, we have a screenshot that may or may not be relevant and is rather one-sided in context, could you maybe explain that?&quot;</p>

            <p>From my perspective, a whole bunch of people were about to be slapped with a potentially months-long ban for just being in the chat at that time, regardless of what they said or what they were thinking. At that point, I did (and still do) think what I had done was incredibly stupid, so even if I didn&#39;t particularly want to be banned, I was willing to put up with it, but I thought just smacking down everyone wasn&#39;t particularly just, and so I thought that rather than just sit around and talk about it and ending up being shouted down, I was going to do something to rectify it.

            <p>There is a general feel that trying to create your own personal PPC chatroom should be viewed as a perhaps-misguided reaction to some other cause, and that the cause is what we should be looking at, rather than the act itself.

            <p>I&#39;ve apologised for the Brink incident in the past, and offer that apology again. It was never my intention to engage in bullying behaviour of any sort, and I see ways the incident could have been avoided with benefit of hindsight. It&#39;s still my opinion that the whole thing was down to a series of miscommunications and misinterpretations, and not malicious behaviour on anyone&#39;s parts. Given this incident occurred a couple years ago now, I obviously have no intention of allowing any such things to occur. I&#39;ll admit to having been protective of the DIA in the past too; I do <i>have</i> some stories with them in the works, but obviously nobody should be claiming an entire section of the PPC for their own.<br><br>As for the accusations of manipulative behaviour and disingenuousness, well, I can certainly apologise if I&#39;ve made people feel that&#39;s the case but I very much do not appreciate being called a liar, or having those people brush off what I have to say as insincere. So boo on them. That&#39;s just outright insulting and I don&#39;t plan to stand for it.</p>

            <p>I was asked to give my side of the story at the time, and I did so. The discussion of a board apology I remember pretty clearly, actually; this was when Ix posted the thread that started the whole July thing in the Discord. I talked about my intention of posting an apology in reply, Delta advised me not to unless it was specifically requested because it could make things worse, so I held on to it. I did send Ix a Discord PM offering an apology, too, and could post a screenshot easily enough.<br><br><br>As for not standing for it, obviously I can&#39;t do anything directly since this is the internet, so it&#39;s more me saying I find that incredibly disrespectful and don&#39;t accept being spoken of - or to, since people have called me a manipulative liar right to my face - that way. I&#39;m not being insincere when I state my regret for what happened and that I don&#39;t intend for any such thing to happen again. There are people I <i>could</i> say are obviously insincere, but let&#39;s not go there.<br><br>Of course, I can&#39;t actually stop you from looking at it however you choose to.</p>

            <p>hS and Nesh have covered a lot of what I might like to say, so I&#39;ll try to keep instances of repeating them to a minimum.<br><br>However, I&#39;d like to note that you have accused unspecified other people here of being manipulative and/or insincere. I also call on you to either give more details (names would be good, names and examples of the bad behavior would be great) or retract the allegations.<br><br>As a suggestion (let me be clear, I&#39;m not saying you have to do this, or that would be a bad thing if you didn&#39;t, just that it would be a good thing if you did) you might want to take another shot at the apology for the Brink incident. Your apology in this thread is rather vague and could, in context, be interpreted as insincere (see Nesh).<br><br>I suggest that, if you want to try again, your apology should identify some actions you took or didn&#39;t take. It doesn&#39;t have to be too specific (see Miah&#39;s &quot;I made some pretty big mistakes, and I hurt several people. I am sorry.&quot;). Furthermore, you should (in this case) apologize for the harm your actions caused. You can do that without admitting that that harm was somehow your fault, of course. Both of these actions would make it clearer what it is you&#39;re apologizing for, which would help refute the interpretation of your posts that paints you as insincere and/or manipulative.<br><br>Obviously, if you&#39;ve already done something like this over PM, you don&#39;t need to do it on the Board again, unless you&#39;d like to.</p>

            <p>-If by &#39;There are people I could say are obviously insincere&#39; you mean there are people you feel have outstanding issues with the community which have a potential to cause trouble at a later date, this would be a good time to bring them up. Ditto if there are people who are in the habit of calling you a manipulative liar.<br><br>-As per usual when I am unaware of a second incident to the &quot;Brink&quot; betaing one (which was about two years ago, I think?), and since Ekyl has apologised (by PM and in a drunken rant(?) on the Discord), I feel that the standard &#39;don&#39;t do it again/be aware that repeating this behaviour could lead to a ban&#39; response is appropriate.<br><br>-With respect to the manipulative/insincere comments: I believe you when you say you&#39;re not being. However, it has been made clear to both me and you that you&#39;re definitely being perceived that way. Consider this as a form of concrit, then: rather than being angry at the people who&#39;ve given it (who, I will add, all qualified it with &#39;comes off as&#39; or &#39;gives the impression of&#39;, rather than saying &quot;Ekyl is super insincere and manipulative!&quot;), try to learn from it instead so you don&#39;t keep giving the same negative impression. Neshomeh has given you some advice; the main thing I&#39;d add is a suggestion that you look back over <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=306497;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">the Discord log from last month</a> and look for how your words <i>could be read as</i> dismissing Iximaz&#39;s distress and fanning the flames against July.<br><br>If you have difficulty spotting it - we all have blind spots, particularly when it comes to our own words! - I&#39;m willing to go through it line-by-line and highlight things for you. It would probably be best to do that off-Board though; let me know.<br><br>-You&#39;ve covered the DIA thing; I don&#39;t think anything else needs to be said.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Doclit is one of the people who has outright called me a liar in the past. Primarily, with people who are obviously insincere, I meant Scapegrace. Literally <i>all she does</i> in this community is attack people, get told &quot;don&#39;t do that&quot;, give some half-hearted apology, then go right back to it the next time she decides to join in a discussion. This has been a pattern for years, and all that&#39;s ever done the latest time she decides to up and insult or go after people for no reason is she&#39;s told &quot;please cut it out&quot;. She doesn&#39;t apologise for how she acts or treats people, she dismisses it out of hand and goes right back to it as soon as people are done tut-tutting about it. Her &quot;oh I&#39;m a hypocrite&quot; spiel is far less sincere than any apology I have made.<br><br>As for the rest, it seems pretty well covered.</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve looked over the chat logs again now that I&#39;ve gained more emotional distance from my actions.<br><br>In retrospect, it is vary clear that I participated in the witch hunt against July more than I thought I did at the time. <br><br>During the Discord discussion, I publicly presented what I know of Iximaz&#39;s allegations against various people, and included such evidence as I had. That is, like hS described me, I stood up and said &quot;here is the evidence, let us pass judgment&quot;. I only gave one side of the story because that was just about all I had.<br><br>While doing that, I publicly alleged bad behavior on the part of July (along with Neshomeh and Huinesoron) <i>while they weren&#39;t around to defend themselves</i>. What I did was <b>wrong</b>. <br><br>My main intent was to make sure that everyone would be as informed as possible during any subsequent discussions of Iximaz&#39;s allegations. I realize now that, under the circumstances, my actions instead significantly contributed to (or even started) a lynch mob against JulyFlame. That is, I accused someone of misconduct, without giving them the ability to defend themselves, in front of an emotionally charged crowd that was already biased against them (thanks to the actions of Data Junkie <i>et al.</i>). I now better understand that those conditions don&#39;t give rise to anything resembling a fair hearing, they create angry mobs. <br><br>While everyone was riled up, I made a few comments trying to get people not to go after July, but it was too little, too late.<br><br>My only defense is that I didn&#39;t realize what I was doing. That is, that I negligently stirred up a witch-hunt, as opposed to intentionally doing so.<br><br>To make matters worse, while I was presenting evidence, I revealed July&#39;s real name and face in the Discord without her consent. That was <b>completely unacceptable</b> behavior on my part, even ignoring the aggravating factors that July is in the military and that she had previously been the subject of severe harassment here that included death threats. My only defense, as I said last time, is that, in the heat of the moment, I&#39;d forgotten that the screenshot had personal information in it and that I made a very serious mistake by not checking what I was posting.<br><br>Therefore:<br>- I again apologize to JulyFlame for leaking her personal information, causing her to fear for her life.<br>- I apologize to JulyFlame for participating in (and stirring up) the witch-hunt against her.<br>- I apologize to JulyFlame for being a significant cause of the harassment she faced during the incident.<br>- I apologize to JulyFlame, Neshomeh, and Huinesoron for accusing them of misconduct in the Discord behind their backs, especially since the circumstances led (in July&#39;s case) or could have led (in the other cases) to witch-hunts against them.<br>- I apologize to the PPC as a whole, for severely eroding our ability to trust each other with personal information<br><br>I have recognized that my behavior was wrong, and I regret what I did. I am currently under a self-imposed 2-3 month ban (actually, let&#39;s make that a bit more concrete and say that the ban ends no earlier that the first weekend of June) from the PPC so that my actions might have actual consequences for me, instead of a slap on the wrist. This ban will, of course, continue. If the community chooses to impose additional consequences on me, I will accept them.<br><br>- Tomash</p>

            <p>I guess I&#39;ve addressed my feelings on my ability to force people out <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=307864;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">here</a>. I&#39;ll add that people I&#39;ve knowingly and deliberately contributed to &quot;forcing out&quot; include Jacer (proud bigot), Ammo Guy (troll/creepy), and zdimensia (extremely disruptive with overtones of racism), all of whom were banned by vast majority vote. The only controversial bans of any length that I&#39;ve voted for are Data Junkie (not banned; ultimately revealed to be a troll) and Tomash (doxxing; undertook his own ban amid opposition).<br><br>I will cop to using the best logic, reason, and rhetoric I have at my disposal in <i>attempts</i> to sway people to my position. However, <i>everyone</i> does that. That&#39;s what discussion and debate are <i>for</i>: everyone presents their case, the merits of each case are weighed against the others, and ideally, the best possible solution emerges.<br><br>I think I&#39;ve earned some respect by always making an effort to be, as Seafarer put it, &quot;<a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=307711;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">extremely thoughtful and reasonable</a>&quot; (thanks, by the way!), but nonetheless, I cannot force anyone to agree with me if they vehemently don&#39;t. I do not have mind-control powers. Also, I&#39;m not above being talked out of any position I hold if someone or several someones come along with a better argument; and if I&#39;m outvoted, I&#39;m outvoted.<br><br>There&#39;s also the fact that, as I&#39;ve complained about in this thread, I&#39;m often one of only a few people talking. I&#39;m not going to accept the blame for that. If y&#39;all are sick of me and hS and other oldbies doing most of the talking and the doing of things, then the only solution is for you—yes, <i>you</i>—to speak up and to do things. There is, of course, a risk that others won&#39;t like what you say or do. If it&#39;s not worth it to you to take that risk, then you had better accept that you&#39;re leaving matters up to whoever feels it <i>is</i> worth it—or that, if there is no one else, then nothing will happen at all.<br><br>I reckon that goes to the last bit about my supposed ability to silence discussion, too. Since I cannot actually force a ban against anyone I disagree with, all that you risk by speaking in opposition to me is that I out-debate you. But you can&#39;t win a debate by not having one at all, can you?<br><br>TL;DR, I believe these accusations are unfounded. It seems like the general tenor of this thread is that most people agree.<br><br>If anyone would like me to explain my behavior in a specific incident, I will do so.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>The disciplinary actions usually seen in the PPC are:<br><br>-Requiring an apology (and a change of behaviour thereafter).<br><br>-Requiring an apology (and a warning that backsliding will lead to a ban).<br><br>-Temporary ban from the PPC community (to allow people time to change their ways).<br><br>-Permanent ban from the PPC community (for persons whose behaviour is incompatible with the community).<br><br>There are also several Discord-specific punishments which I don&#39;t know the details of, and general social consequences of bad behaviour (eg, people not willingly talking to you).

            <p>There&#39;s value in having a theoretical discussion about behavior, since, like Nesh said, it&#39;ll establish our principles, which we can then check against how we&#39;ve behaved in practice (or against specific cases).<br><br>However, the main purpose of this thread is to heal wounds in the community, and those wounds weren&#39;t caused by abstract principles. They were caused by specific people doing specific things. Eventually (maybe once the theoretical bit has mostly run its course) we need to point out the actual things that happened so we can address them directly and (ideally) begin the process of reconciliation. In addition, some people might not realize that one of the things that&#39;s being discussed in the abstract is something they&#39;ve supposedly done, so I think it would be rather useless not to point it out to them. After all, if they&#39;re doing a bad thing, how will they change if they don&#39;t know about it?<br><br>We certainly shouldn&#39;t be looking to punish people, generally. I agree that permabans are for behavior that&#39;s, in some sense, severely toxic to the community where we expect that the person doing it almost certainly won&#39;t change. <br><br>Temporary bans are a slightly trickier questions. I know mine was meant to make me feel bad, because that&#39;s why I imposed it on myself! (Well, and also to make it very clear that what I did was an extremely bad thing that was worthy of some sort of punishment.)<br><br>As to people arguing that the person they accused didn&#39;t do anything wrong, it&#39;s possible that the people doing this didn&#39;t connect the abstract behavior you described with the specific incident they told you about. That is, could it be that they didn&#39;t think the incident in question was in the bucket you put it in?<br><br>I agree that the low participation rate is concerning. Unfortunately, it&#39;s rather hard to tell why no one&#39;s posting. If you haven&#39;t posted in this thread, could you take a moment to give a brief (fits in the subject line, or maybe spills slightly into the body), off-the-cuff response as to why? I think that&#39;ll help us understand what&#39;s going on.<br><br>- Tomash</p>

            <p>Firstly, I&#39;m horrible at reading comprehension, my own writings aside. Whenever I read anything with walls of text I tend to remember only the beginning and ending bits without really digesting the middle so effectively. It&#39;s a thing I&#39;ve been trying to remedy for a while now but if I end up not being able to properly comprehend something super-important unless I really have to force myself to do so, I doubt I&#39;d be able to provide an objective response.<br><br>Secondly, I&#39;m horrible at group discussions. The one time when I stirred up drama with a group of people on DeviantArt once is proof of that, but so is the fact that when I jump into a conversation, I sometimes get so overtaken by my own emotions that I say the wrong thing at the worst possible moment. It hasn&#39;t happened all the time here on the Board, but it has enough that I&#39;ve become reluctant to speak up. Especially since a lot of people have already worded things better than I could given what little time I have.<br><br>Thirdly and finally, I&#39;m horrible at my time management. My family has very strict procedures with policing our leisure time because we&#39;re fast approaching the age when we can&#39;t rely on our parents&#39; health insurance, mortgage, etc., and that means our parents are dead-set on making us good at doing grown-up things. Between that and my part-time job AND looking for full-time employment, I have very little time and resources to spare in any online conversation no matter how much I want to join (which I desperately want to, given that the incidents that have been plaguing us so far these past few months have affected everyone and I doubt just standing by would be the right thing). I&#39;ve been pulled from online communities by my family for getting caught up in heated situations before - I was forced to take a hiatus from DeviantArt during the late stage of my graduate term because I accidentally told my dad about the aforementioned drama there, for example.<br><br>I fully acknowledge how important this conversation is, and I&#39;ll leave thoughts on specific topics later, but I&#39;m hesitant about being involved for the above reasons even though I KNOW I should be regardless. I&#39;m guessing a lot of people feel the same way for similar reasons, but to this I&#39;d advise that it isn&#39;t a bad thing to speak up while you have the chance. Every little statement adds to the discussion and the broader the scope of the conversation, the better a general picture we can get and the closer we&#39;ll be to a general resolution to the problems at hand.<br><br>-SkarmorySilver, who&#39;s just gotten back from work, is tired, and is still being asked by his dad to practice Python because that&#39;s always fun.</p>

            <p>I have read over the thread once or twice, and I have tired to pen down responses myself as to the problems proposed. But, to be honest, I don&#39;t know what to do to help the situation. There is no clear-cut, easy answer to these problems, and my thoughts can be generally boiled down to, &quot;Yeah, don&#39;t do that.&quot; And that&#39;s not exactly a helpful position, is it? Saying, &quot;yeah, don&#39;t do that,&quot; won&#39;t stop anybody from doing that. On the whole, people will make all kinds of excuses as to their behavior, and why what they are doing is totally acceptable. I don&#39;t know. I&#39;m just at a loss for words right now. I am off tomorrow, and I swear I will read over the thread once more and actually try and contribute something to the conversation. But, that&#39;s why I have been silent this time.</p>

            <p>I don&#39;t believe I&#39;ve ever voted for one, either. The role of a ban on the PPC Board is to remove someone whose actions are incompatible with the PPC. That&#39;s it. That&#39;s the sole purpose.<br><br>&quot;Making someone feel bad&quot;, &quot;driving home the lesson&quot;, &quot;giving them time to reconsider&quot;, or (heaven help us) &quot;punishing them for their wrongdoing&quot; are not things I feel a ban can accomplish. Someone can&#39;t show they&#39;ve improved by just not showing up for three months - they prove it by <i>behaving better</i>. And if they prove they <i>cannot</i> behave better, then we do not want them in this community.*<br><br>Bans are a tool to protect our community, not a form of criminal punishment. I think the notion of tempbans came over from IRC culture, and honestly, I wish it had stayed there.<br><br>hS<br><br>*I am not, in principle, against someone returning year<b>s</b>, plural, after they were banned, when enough time has passed that they could well have changed. JulyFlame was a very different person when she came back to the PPC; people do change. But I feel strongly that saying &#39;in a year you will be a better person!&#39; is nonsensical.</p>

            <p>Mainly because I haven&#39;t been around for the last six months at all, and only sporadically before that, and therefore haven&#39;t seen most of the issues that have prompted this thread, and short of me spending the next few hours reading back over the last few months of Board posts, I&#39;d prefer to refrain from commenting on most specifics.<br><br>But feel I should put my $0.02 in on this one and say that I agree 100% with hS on this one.<br><br>A ban is the last resort, and a recognition that a person&#39;s demonstrated behaviours are incompatible with the standards of our community; standards that exist to make this a safe space where we can all be wacky loons.

            <p>While in principle I think like I said, there&#39;s no-one we&#39;ve banned that I&#39;d actually want to see come back. Jacer was, what, 6, 7 years ago? By now they could have converted to Buddhism, moved to Bora Bora, and written a bestselling series of erotic detective novels.

            <p>I do think there&#39;s value in discussing what we agree with and don&#39;t agree with in principle, though. If it turns out that what we&#39;ve said in principle doesn&#39;t jive with how we&#39;ve behaved regarding particular cases, that&#39;s an indication we need to rethink either our reaction to that case or our principles. Critical thinking with self-reflection is always a good thing.<br><br>Where I think this is going wrong is that only, like, ten people have commented so far, and only a handful on more than one or two issues. I know it&#39;s a heavy set of topics, and I respect that people may want to give it some thought before joining in. All the same, I am feeling frustrated about being one of the few to consistently make an effort at this sort of thing, knowing it may be perceived as me flaunting my authority.<br><br>Maybe more people will turn up over the weekend?<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>(Sorry for not taking part in this sooner, but I wanted to think carefully before writing anything)<br><br><br>I&#39;ve seen a lot of abstraction, of &quot;what ifs&quot; in this thread - however, by what I&#39;ve seen here, the problem is another, and it is the awareness of own&#39;s behaviour.<br><br>For example, during the doxxing incident many people believed they were doing nothing wrong, and some insisted on such a belief even after their fallacy had been brought out and explained.<br><br>This is not to say that we need to strike the people instead of the behaviours, but behaviours aren&#39;t an entity living on it own.

This is not good for Reason, can you do anything about it?&quot;.

            <p><u><b>Disrespecting your Betas</b></u><br><br>This has come up a few times in a few different ways. The two most prominent are:<br><br>-Asking someone to beta, then posting the story before they&#39;ve given the go-ahead. Sometimes their name stays on the piece (falsely implying that they&#39;ve completed the betaing), others it&#39;s removed.<br><br>-Not taking comments by your beta seriously. Sometimes a beta makes a suggestion, only to have it flatly ignored for no actual reason. This can feed over into &#39;Not Taking Concrit&#39;.<br><br><u><b>Bad Conduct as a Beta</b></u><br><br>This can take several forms, but the most common is trying to bulldoze over the writer&#39;s objections to reshape their story according to your ideas. It can also include being asked to beta a specific aspect, but unilaterally extending that to the rest of the story.<br><br><u><b>Not Taking Concrit</b></u><br><br>There are two ways this tends to manifest:<br><br>-Ignoring concrit. Sometimes, people have an issue with their story pointed out to them and react by saying &#39;well, it&#39;s published now, so whatever&#39;.<br><br>-Overreacting to concrit. There have been incidents where criticism (constructive or otherwise) has been interpreted to mean that the fic should be taken down immediately, when this wasn&#39;t the intent of the critic.<br><br><u><b>Falling Short of PPC Standards Elsewhere</b></u><br><br>If a PPCer unapologetically writes a (non-PPC) badfic and refuses concrit, should the PPC act in some way? What if they engage in canon-breaking roleplay, or other such forms of &#39;fanfic&#39;?</p>

            <p><b><u>Disrespecting Your Betas</u></b><br><br>Like so many others in this thread have said, this is simple courtesy. Your betas not your employees; they are doing you a favor. It is therefore on you, as the author, to listen to their thoughts with an open mind. And if you disagree with their suggestions? Then discuss it with them! Explain your position and why you think something should be done in a specific way. Have a conversation with them. Who knows? Maybe one of you will change your mind. Maybe you&#39;ll both come away with a greater understanding of how the other person thinks.<br><br><b><u>Bad Conduct as a Beta</u></b><br><br>Once again: simple courtesy and communication. If you feel the beta is trying to overwrite your entire story or step outside what you asked them to do, tell them.<br><br>I also agree with Ix and Nesh here regarding weak betas. Volunteering to be a editor should be like how beta-testing a video game used to be. If you&#39;re going into it thinking &#39;Ooh, I&#39;m getting to look at this cool thing first!&#39; then you&#39;re doing it wrong. Being a beta is a responsibility. You have to find the parts that work and the parts that don&#39;t, then tell the creator about everything that you found.<br><br><b><u>Not Taking Concrit</u></b><br><br>Both of these are extreme reactions, and both are bad. If someone has legitimate points about your story, then ignoring them is arrogance. Plus, &quot;it&#39;s published now&quot; is ultimately meaningless when we&#39;re talking about the medium we work in. You can literally edit your stories at any time! Goodness knows I&#39;ve gone back and made a few corrections and additions post-publishing.<br><br>That being said, don&#39;t go the other route and just take the story down. Obviously you should make sure that your work is as polished as possible before you publish it, but once it is? Defend its merits. Get into a conversation. Exchange views with the person providing criticism. If you come away from that still convinced that you erred, only then should you take the story down.<br><br>I&#39;m going end this section by being completely blunt. Like Nesh said, if you can&#39;t take constructive criticism, then Don&#39;t. Write. Being a writer is hard. It&#39;s something you have to work at, to improve at, every time you put pen to paper or fingers to keyboard. If you&#39;re unwilling to improve yourself, or you don&#39;t think there&#39;s anything left to improve, then you need to reconsider what you are doing. There&#39;s always another lesson to learn. Concrit is often a vector for those lessons.<br><br><b><u>Falling Short of PPC Standards Elsewhere</u></b><br><br>I don&#39;t we as a community can stop our members from writing badfic. Obviously they shouldn&#39;t, because (as many have said) it&#39;s rather hypocritical for them to do so while sporking the badfics of others. I feel like if you join this community if you like good writing and want to make good writing, not just because you want to be a snarky wiseacre on the Internet. There are plenty of places you can do that which aren&#39;t here.<br><br>As for RPs? Whatever. RPs are goofy and ephemeral things. Go nuts! But not literally.</p>

            <p>Something that has been briefly mentioned is that there are different types of beta reading. Some authors want nothing more than a SPaG check. They might be upset with a beta for suggestions regarding a clunky sentence or sticky plot point, because they only want the SPaG help in minimal words. Other authors want to have long chats regarding plots, the wording of sentences, canon points, characterization, fan theories, almost anything via the comments on the Gdoc. (I wouldn&#39;t know <i>anyone</i> like that /sarcasm).<br><br>Both of those situations are valid beta/author relationships. If you are a SPaG only author and you get a chatty beta, you aren&#39;t going to be happy. If are a chatty author and get a minimalist beta you aren&#39;t going to be happy. <br><br>Being more specific about what you want when posting the request should help with getting the right match. Being honest about your abilities is important, too. Me, personally, I will never be a SPaG beta. My grammar is shaky at best. It&#39;s improved over the years, but I still make a lot of mistakes and wouldn&#39;t want someone else to think that my reading means they are good on the grammar front. However, I like to think I am pretty good at some other aspects of beta reading like the overall voice of the piece.<br><br>The suggestion for feedback to your betas is a good one. Allowing people to be apprentice beta readers is a good idea. Having demo Gdocs of good beta work available is a good idea, too.<br><br>I don&#39;t know if everyone is totally familiar with Gdocs, but it allows you to set what level of access people have to the document. I like to set it to comment only for the beta process. The beta can highlight and add a comment, but cannot change the text. I like having documents I am beta reading set like this, too. It avoids having a cat walk across the keyboard and change things without my knowledge when I leave the computer for a bit. The comments appear on the side of the document as near to the highlighted text as possible, and have the added bonus of allowing you to reply to them. <br><br>Suggest is another level it offers where the beta can type in your document, but it is highlighted and asks the author if they want to accept the change or not. I prefer comments myself even for, &quot;you missed the word &#39;a&#39; here.&quot; type stuff.</p>

            <p>So, if I remember right (I &quot;main&quot; LaTeX or plain text for most of the writing I do these days) both Word and GDocs have a &quot;track changes&quot; feature, which (hopefully) tracks edit suggestions and comments. If so, we could demonstrate good beta reading by either having someone (and their betas) volunteer a well-beta&#39;d document with all of its history intact or by creating a well-beta&#39;d document for demonstration purposes. Then, people could look over the revision history to see how it&#39;s done.<br><br>Your idea of what I&#39;m going to call &quot;apprentice betas&quot; seems like a good one. I think that, if I ever write anything, I&#39;d be open to doing that (even though I don&#39;t fit the &quot;experienced writers&quot; part).</p>

            <p>Feel free to react as you wish, but beyond the &#39;not taking concrit&#39;, I just realized there could be another issue which could arise :... &#39;not having concrit&#39;.<br><br>I guess I&#39;m going in a mineflied there, but I think improving can be hard if we don&#39;t get any reaction or input for ouur stories.

            <p>A lot of bits have been spilled about beta conduct and concrit. So, my points, some of which are rather terse because the detailed versions have already come up:<br><br>- Don&#39;t jump the gun on your betas. That&#39;s rude. Not banable, though.<br><br>- If you&#39;re a beta, don&#39;t slink off without warning for long periods of time.<br><br>- Obviously, you have final say over your work. However, completely ignoring your betas isn&#39;t good. Explaining why you disagree with beta comments is probably a good thing. Not bannable either, or particularly enforceable.<br><br>- Offering to beta and then not actually doing it is also rude. We shouldn&#39;t ban for it, though.<br><br>- Bulldozing as a beta: Rot cool. If it veers into bullying, that&#39;s potentially cause for consequences.<br><br>- [insert Nesh&#39;s comments about writer/beta communication here]<br><br>- A few folks have said they don&#39;t ask for betas publicly because it&#39;s hard to turn someone down or because turning someone down causes drama. This is a cultural issue. Folks, just because there&#39;s a call for betas doesn&#39;t mean the person calling has to take your offer. The fact that they didn&#39;t take you up on an offer of beta reading isn&#39;t (generally) an attack on you or your abilities.<br><br>- Ignoring concrit. Um, if you&#39;re doing that, it makes you a bit hypocritical. That being said, disagreeing with concrit isn&#39;t ignoring it.<br><br>- We should, like several people said, be encouraging better concrit-taking behavior politely and firmly.<br><br>- Sergio (among others?) proposed Permission Suspended for serious, persistent quality issues without improvement. The one case I think that might have been appropriate, there was a retraction. Therefore, that proposal is so very hypothetical that we shouldn&#39;t enshrine it as policy at this time. If a situation where we need to consider that sanction comes up, we can discuss it in that context and have a specific vote.<br><br>- Overreacting to concrit isn&#39;t good either. Again, Nesh said it rather well, so consider her thoughts on this incorporated into my post.<br><br>- I don&#39;t see us as the fandom police, and neither does just about everyone else here (right?). So we shouldn&#39;t be handing out bans for writing badfic (and certainly not for having written it in the past, since we&#39;re about improvement here). That being said, if you&#39;re simultaneously publishing badfic that you&#39;re not taking concrit on and doing PPC stuff, you might suffer a loss of reputation here because you&#39;re being a bit of a hypocrite. If you don&#39;t have Permission yet, that sort of thing could be potential grounds for a denial, I think.<br><br>- I&#39;m pretty sure there&#39;s a widespread notion (even here) that being un-canonical in fandom based RPs isn&#39;t really that big a deal. They&#39;re generally one of those just for fun, critique free spaces Neshomeh mentioned in her response to this topic. <br><br>Now, just because I said something shouldn&#39;t be a banable offense, that doesn&#39;t mean there shouldn&#39;t be consequences for it in some cases. It&#39;s just that those consequences will be social consequences, like a loss of reputation, or, say, not getting asked to beta stuff anymore.<br><br>I prefer, however, that this loss of reputation not happen completely out of the public eye. If someone&#39;s a super-lazy beta, for example, the solution isn&#39;t to whine to all your friends about it and never say anything on the Board, especially if you never tell this person what you think of them. I&#39;m not saying we can&#39;t discuss this sort of stuff in private, I&#39;m just saying that it&#39;d be much better if there were some indication of these collective opinions on the record.<br><br>There&#39;s another thing I think we should think about as far as our collective behavior, and that&#39;s what happens to missions after they&#39;re been posted. Missions don&#39;t usually get very many responses (usually it&#39;s a small one digit number), so it&#39;s rather hard to tell if they&#39;re being read at all. Some of this might be that the chat-dwelling parts of the PPC get a lot of their acknowledgements in chat, so you don&#39;t see them on the Board, but that doesn&#39;t seem like the whole story. <br><br>I suspect that part of it is that we don&#39;t have a technical or cultural equivalent to things like the Kudos button on AO3. That is, there&#39;s no way to express a vague sense of appreciation or &quot;Well, I like it, but I don&#39;t have any detailed thoughts&quot;, as opposed to leaving a full review. Does anyone have any suggestions for an appropriate way to do that sort of thing here?<br><br>On a related topic, I&#39;ve noticed that sometimes, missions get a bit long in a tedious way, which makes them less fun to read and review. There&#39;s no rule that says you have to get all the charges or mission the whole fic. In fact, you often shouldn&#39;t. (This point could just be a case of individual writing styles and tastes differing, though)<br><br>- Tomash<br><br>P. S. I think this puts me into the very small group of people that&#39;ve replied to all four subthreads. Is there a prize?</p>

            <p>I personally believe that not taking concrit, especially when there are big issues with the relevant piece, should not be acceptable in the PPC. That&#39;s one of the typical behaviours of the authors of the badfics we mock - if the same happens in an official PPC mission it would make us all hipocrites.<br><br>Of course I don&#39;t believe this to be grounds of banning someone from the PPC - however, if there are repeated quality issues and lack of taking concrit in a spinoff, we might want to tell its author to stop releasing missions (Permission Suspended?) until the issues are solved.</p>

            <p>For the role-play question:<br><br>I personally was involved once in a role-play hosted by the concrit-&quot;allergic&quot; mediocrefic author that I keep talking about, and it did break canon a bit (anybody with me on the fact that Xenomorphs can&#39;t be tamed as pets?). <br><br>So, I&#39;d like to offer the idea that as long as the person themselves didn&#39;t do anything canon-breaking (especially if they made the noble effort to fix the canon and got retconned out/ignored), they&#39;ll be okay. Otherwise, give them a short warning about sticking to canon in role-plays and discipline them further if the behavior continues; more points to them if they reply to the warning and acknowledge that they did something wrong. Also, keep in mind the host&#39;s rules and what was considered acceptable in the role-play: the one I was in was a big sci-fi crossover, and even beyond that, players were allowed to teleport stuff in from other universes or even real life (which I did, since I very much dislike having the Force as my only weapon.) <br><br>Make sure they understand the consequences of their actions, and offer help to them if they need advice when encountering further situations where they&#39;d need to break canon to get what they want (e.g. crazy admins and stuff like that.)<br><br>Is this a good idea? I hope you don&#39;t mind me putting in some stuff - see, I can be logical when I&#39;ve calmed down from the &quot;oh boy new people&quot; hype. ;)<br><br>-Twistey</p>

            <p>First of all, thank you for your input! It&#39;s good that you&#39;re speaking up, since this is a community-wide discussion and you are part of the community just as much as me or the other folks that&#39;ve been around for a long time.<br><br>However, a few words in your post caught my attention, namely &quot;mediocrefic author that I keep talking about&quot;. It&#39;s highly likely that I&#39;m taking that out of context or overanalyzing it, especially since I haven&#39;t been following what you&#39;ve said about this author too closely, so this might be way off base, but are you looking to stir up the Fandom Police (tm) against someone? If so, that&#39;s not us (unless I&#39;ve missed a memo recently). </p>

<li>All I can say is yee :3<br>2. Nope. Well, not unless she makes excuses when you try to concrit her first. She&#39;s an IRL acquaintance of mine, so I get exposed to her, well, mediocrefic a lot. Is there any way I can get someone to concrit the fics? I can tell you the account if you want to know.<br>3. Another thing about fanfic (dunno if I&#39;ve already said stuff that would make this evident), but it&#39;s good to be lenient on those who do the role-play because multiple people are involved. Since the other player has a choice of who they want to role-play as and what they want to happen, two characters who could never possibly meet in canon (e.g. pretty much any Homestuck OC and pretty much any canon from the same fandom) could be role-playing with one another. There could be role-plays where the only way to go would be to interact with a plot hole the other RPer created. Or it could be in one circumstance that the only way to make a fight fair against a Mary Sue (I&#39;ve got another friend who literally summons in gods to help her. GODS!) would be to become a Sue yourself. It usually depends on the situation, so judge it accordingly.<br><br>-Twistey</li>

            <p>Oh, I don&#39;t see any problem with linking a fic you think could use some concrit. I don&#39;t know if I&#39;ll be able to provide it, but I figure there might be someone here who&#39;ll have the time and fandom knowledge to give a good review.<br><br>As to RP, I think my comment on the matter was that RPs are basically a free-for-all, so we don&#39;t spork them.

<li>I can give you the account if you&#39;d like, since AO3 is blocked on my computer and I can&#39;t give a link. The username is MissC3PO (guess who her LO is?!). Don&#39;t concrit the one about C-3PO (the robot) being pregnant, she told me that she didn&#39;t write it and somebody randomly stuck it on her account. There are a few other fics that are this way, too, but I don&#39;t remember what the other names were. She&#39;s also thinking of shutting down her account, so hurry up!<br><br>2. I could be wrong, but isn&#39;t there a Department of Bad RP? (gets on the page and references it from here on out)...Yep. Except it&#39;s called the Bad Role-play Department. Bird, haha. ...Oh, okay. Upon further reading, it deals with RP fic. So if the RP becomes a fic, they get sent in. Not if it just stays undocumented. But the main question was &quot;do we punish PPCers for doing something that breaks canon when they&#39;re RPing?&quot; I still think (and it seems like you agree) that it depends on what the other players do as well.<br><br>3. It&#39;s harder to do when there&#39;s a player behind the Sue. They can retcon out your outsmarting of them. It&#39;s like this:<br>&quot;I lured your character into a room with spikes about to crush them! Knowing that your character cannot escape this situation, given the list of powers you gave earlier, there&#39;s nothing you can do!&quot; <br>&quot;Well I summon a huge blast of power and BLAST TEH ROOM 2 BITZ!!11!!!1!&quot; <br>&quot;But...

            <p>First, attempting to allay the assumption of authority: I have fairly strong opinions on these topics, formed over much experience from both sides. I word my opinions strongly. Please don&#39;t take self-expression as dictation. {= )<br><br><b><u>On Disrespecting Your Betas:</u></b><br><br>This is bad, don&#39;t do it. If you ask someone for their opinions on your work, you are obligating yourself to at least give those opinions some thought. You are also obligating yourself to allow them the time to do the job properly. I raise an eyebrow every time I see a request for betas go up one day followed by a mission post the next day. I dunno how much free time y&#39;all have, but surely it takes more than a day for multiple betas (because it&#39;s usually multiple) to all read through a work and give thoughtful concrit of it, and then for the writer to make thoughtful changes based on those remarks? I&#39;d like to see us collectively take a deep breath and adjust our expectations to more like at least a week between asking for betas and publishing a story.<br><br><b><u>On Bad Conduct as a Beta:</u></b><br><br>I agree with Ix that failing to beta at all is far more common than abusing one&#39;s authority as a beta. To beta is, at its heart, to give concrit, and thorough concrit at that. If you can&#39;t find anything at all to say about a piece, positive or negative, other than &quot;you&#39;re good!&quot;, you are doing it wrong.<br><br>Also, and this applies to both parties, I think there&#39;s a large issue with failure to communicate. A writer needs to be up front about their expectations of their betas, and betas need to be up front about their availability and ability to meet said expectations. In cases where someone has posted without the go-ahead from their beta(s), I seem to recall a lot of &quot;I hadn&#39;t heard anything for a while, so I didn&#39;t know they weren&#39;t done.&quot;<br><br>Writers, if you&#39;re not sure, ask. Betas, if something comes up and the job is going to take longer than you initially thought, say so. It&#39;s as simple as that.<br><br><b><u>On Not Taking Concrit:</u></b><br><br>This is bad, don&#39;t do it. To elaborate on each point:<br><br>1. It is polite to acknowledge it when someone comments on your work. If they have a question or uncertainty, address it. If you choose not to make changes based on concrit, say so, with a little explanation as to why.<br><br>All this should be done politely.<br><br>(Need I say the concrit itself should also be polite?)<br><br>2. Look, folks. If you&#39;re not emotionally prepared to take criticism, don&#39;t publish your work. This goes for all writers, not just fanwriters.<br><br>The fact that one person may not like a specific aspect of your story does not mean it is garbage. People are allowed to have opinions that differ. It&#39;s okay. If you&#39;re not emotionally prepared to stand by your writing decisions—you did have a reason for making them at the time, right?—don&#39;t publish.<br><br>Also, y&#39;know, have reasons for doing things the way you did them. That tends to help. {= )<br><br><b><u>On Falling Short of PPC Standards Elsewhere:</u></b><br><br>We are not fandom police, we have no right to go around dictating what people can and can&#39;t do in other fandom spaces.<br><br>That said, it&#39;s perfectly reasonable to want to get to know each other better and see what our friends have created. If we find out it&#39;s really not good, then the member responsible may certainly expect to hear about it, and to suffer a loss of respect in the PPC if they don&#39;t take it with some aplomb. If nothing else, nobody likes a hypocrite.<br><br>I&#39;m not saying there&#39;s anything wrong with wanting to create stuff just for fun in a space free from critique sometimes, but maybe don&#39;t expect to have a space like that on an open, public platform like FF.net?<br><br>I mean... I&#39;m writing fanfic again. I&#39;m doing it because I just want to have some fun and maybe please some people who like the same sorts of things I do in the fandom. I&#39;m not out to create Great Literature, so when I publish to FF.net, I&#39;m taking a risk that somebody will tell me it sucks. I accept that risk, and I accept my responsibility to myself, as someone who claims to care about good writing, to maintain some standards. If you guys read my silly fics and were like &quot;Uh, Nesh, your OC is being Sueish here, you should maybe stop that,&quot; I would listen. I might not necessarily change anything in a piece I&#39;d already moved on from, but I wouldn&#39;t dismiss it out of hand, either, and I&#39;d take it on board for next time. That&#39;s the aplomb I&#39;m talking about.<br><br><b><u>General Thoughts:</u></b><br><br>Writers walk a fine line between confidence enough to publish and arrogance; between humility enough to accept criticism and self-hate. Most of the writers I know suffer more from an imbalance of the latter than of the former, and perhaps that can make us overly harsh toward people who suffer from the former <s>because dammit, don&#39;t we wish we had that problem, those lucky jerks?</s><br><br>I don&#39;t think any of it needs to be punished beyond the social consequences of loss of respect, which arise naturally. That said, let&#39;s make sure we don&#39;t get carried away with judging people. Remember that the learning process never ends. We&#39;ve all come a long way from where we once were, and we all still have a long way to go. Some of us may need to learn to be more assertive than we like to be in order to communicate effectively. Some of us may need to learn to turn down our egos so we can listen more. Either way, we all make mistakes in the process, so we all need patience and forgiveness sometimes.<br><br>~Neshomeh said a lot of words, and hopes they make sense.</p>

            <p>Beta and concrit problems: These are all kind of tricky situations, due to the perhaps <i>uniquely</i> subjective nature of stories.  I know I&#39;ve received comments criticizing individual lines within my missions in the past, and gave (I hope) reasonable explanations for why those lines were there/were written as wrote them, and didn&#39;t change the line.  This is something that the community as a whole can&#39;t really enforce through punishment; it&#39;s very much a matter of personal responsibility.  (Except in cases where beta-bulldozing devolves into outright bullying—that should be treated the same as bullying in any other situation.)  I think we all need to keep in mind that our community, more than other fanfic community, perhaps, needs to stay aware of what the story is trying to be, more than what we want it to be (and that applies when we&#39;re looking at our own story and at another&#39;s).  To paraphrase Stephen King, &quot;It is the tale, not s/he who tells it or betas it.&quot;<br><br>One caveat, though, in response to what Iximaz mentioned about betas who only agreed to look at Ix&#39;s stories to get previews and failed to provide valuable feedback: that is <b>poor</b>.  That is lazy.  Our community needs to be better than that; it&#39;s ridiculous that someone in our community would ever have such difficulty getting a proofreader.  Taking on a beta job can be a fair investment of time and effort.  If you&#39;re not up to that, don&#39;t take it on.<br><br>Extra-PPC stories: Frankly, we just don&#39;t have juridiction over this.  In my archiving adventures, I&#39;ve certainly come across stories on the Pit accounts of former PPCers that I&#39;ve found questionable, but . . . it&#39;s just not our business to police our members&#39;s writing outside the bounds of this community.<br><br>—doctorlit</p>

            <p>One possible solution to under par beta work is to start giving betas feedback on their feedback.  That way, we would be informed if we were being useful as betas, and perhaps most critically, learn any areas where we had stepped over the line as a beta.  I&#39;ll admit, I would be really fascinated to know what people thought of my beta work.<br><br>—doctorlit promises this isn&#39;t an absurd attempt to lock active writers in a long cycle of critiquing critiques of critiques before publishing, thus slowing down the rate of new missions and giving him a chance to catch up in his archive and finally reach modern-day spin-offs <s>excellent plan I&#39;m glad we&#39;re all agreed</s> !</p>

            <p>While we certainly have some guides here and there on betaing, it does seem that the emphasis we put on improving writing isn&#39;t really quite as, er, <i>emphasised</i>, in the case of betaing. It&#39;d be nice, anyway (I say this as a person who betas occasionally, and is probably rubbish at it and wants to get better) if there was the same encouragement and expectation to give criticism on betawork, as there was to give criticism on stories and writing in general. I suppose there are a variety of differing factors between how writing and betaing work, and how they&#39;re represented, et al, but I know that I, at the very least, still find that sort of stuff helpful. <br><br>I recall, a bit back, we had a little &#39;give lots of criticism on stuff you read&#39; challenge we had a bit back, to get heaps of that going. Perhaps we could do something like that, with betaing? Some form of challenge to get the concrit in it up? But, then, perhaps betaing just doesn&#39;t happen <i>enough</i> for that to work? I wouldn&#39;t know - betaing&#39;s a very sort of &#39;behind the scenes&#39; thing. Which is probably one&#39;ve them differing factors. Anyhow!

            <p>... But I think that writing bad fanfiction outside the PPC shouldn&#39;t really be punished, or even necessarily brought up here in the first place. Setting aside questions of how it would be done (&quot;as part of your introduction post, give us your usernames so we can scrutinize anything you post in the future&quot; is a Bad Idea for a welcoming community), there are differing opinions on what counts as &quot;bad&quot;.

            <p>I agree completely that we shouldn&#39;t demand that people share their work so we can scrutinize it. As you say, that would be rather unwelcoming.<br><br>However, it sounds like you&#39;re saying the quality of all writing is subjective, so I&#39;d like to point out that <a href="http://silvormoon.livejournal.com/11097.html">the rules of writing are not arbitrary</a>. The PPC has not just hung its hat, but nailed it up, on the idea that there are some objective standards by which writing can be judged. Content can be a matter of taste, but we&#39;re not judging content (or we shouldn&#39;t be), we&#39;re judging execution.<br><br>Regarding character-bashing, if you read <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Bash">our article on it</a>, I think you&#39;ll find we&#39;re not taking exception to stories that insightfully mock a character&#39;s flaws for laughs, as in a good parody; we&#39;re taking exception to stories that arbitrarily mangle a character, regardless of their actual positive or negative traits, for plot convenience. Character-bashing can be done poorly in parodies, too, if the bashing isn&#39;t based on anything actually true about that character. As successful comedians will tell you, humor has to be solidly based in the truth, or it falls flat.<br><br>You are, of course, entitled to disagree that there are objective standards in writing, but just know that you probably won&#39;t get a lot of support for that perspective around here. {= )<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>You&#39;ve probably noticed that I don&#39;t have betas for most of my work, and there&#39;s a reason for that. I&#39;ve experienced the bulldozing betas only a handful of times. The ones that made me stop asking for betas were the ones who didn&#39;t even beta at all. For example, people who would use the beta access as a way to read my stories early, leave maybe one or two comments of vague praise that don&#39;t consist of concrit, and then are never heard from again. <br><br>Or the betas that don&#39;t understand the &quot;Don&#39;t mess with characters&#39; dialogue quirks&quot; rule. Yes, I know &#39;ain&#39;t&#39; isn&#39;t grammatically correct, but I had my character say it for a reason. If I reject your suggestion to change it to &#39;isn&#39;t&#39;, stop re-correcting me even after I explain it was deliberate. <br><br>Or the betas who offer to check for SPaG, only to start offering &#39;corrections&#39; that are anything but.<br><br>I feel like I can&#39;t ask for betas on the Board any more because if you don&#39;t take someone up on their offer to beta (or &#39;beta&#39;, as it were), they get insulted. Even if you don&#39;t outright say &quot;No thank you, I&#39;d rather not have you as a beta&quot;, just not having their name put on a piece you asked the Board in general to beta is enough to get an angry email asking why they weren&#39;t given beta access when you picked other people who offered.<br><br>The steamroller betas are few and far between, in my experience. I&#39;ve had many, many more who simply didn&#39;t care enough to do a decent job of it. If you&#39;re going to beta for somebody, do it <i>well</i>.<br><br>Being a bad beta shouldn&#39;t be a banning offense (save for instances where betaing becomes bullying, holy cow that&#39;s a lot of Bs), but it&#39;s definitely something the community as a whole really needs to improve on.</p>

            <p><u>Disrespecting your Betas</u><br><br>My view here is that by asking for a beta, you obligate yourself to listen to and respect their views - but not to actually do what they say. Not waiting a reasonable time for them to offer their opinion on your story is bad, but if you disagree with them on how your story should look, you have the final say. It&#39;s best to offer them a chance to retract their name as a beta, though.<br><br>I don&#39;t think this is a disciplinary offence, frankly. It&#39;s a question of polite courtesy, not something we need to punish.<br><br><u>Bad Conduct as a Beta</u><br><br>I don&#39;t feel that this should be punishable <i>in itself</i>. After all, a beta has no control over the document - at any time the writer can just kick them off and move on.<br><br>But it&#39;s entirely too possible for the &#39;bulldozing&#39; to turn into bullying behaviour, whether through insults (&#39;you&#39;re not listening because you&#39;re stupid&#39;) or simple power dynamics (oldbie/newbie, extrovert/introvert, even male/female). And that <i>is</i> a ban discussion in the works, and if it&#39;s gone unresolved before, it should be resolved now.<br><br><u>Not Taking Concrit</u><br><br>I feel that this is bad behaviour, but not something for punishment. Taking concrit well is a hallmark of a good writer - when someone fails to do it, we should politely but firmly encourage the correct behaviour.<br><br><u>Falling Short of PPC Standards Elsewhere</u><br><br>I do not feel that we have the right to police people&#39;s actions outside the PPC community. Is it a bit hypocritical to write badfic while being in the PPC? Sure. Might mentioning it on the Board lead to you not getting Permission? Also sure. But it&#39;s not a bannable problem, at all.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Over the course of this discussion, there have been many references to punishment (for example: &quot;... this is bad behavior, but shouldn&#39;t be punished. ...&quot;).<br>This made me curious about what types of actions we can take.<br>The following are the ones I could think of.<br><br>Almost all forms of discipline mentioned so far are about bans.<br>These are typically only used for majorly bad behaviors or for an excessive amount of relatively minor bad behaviors.<br>Variations on this include the limited bans (e.g. 3 month ban) and the ban warnings (e.g. if it happens again, they will be banned).<br><br>The only other action I could think of is the revocation of permission.<br>This is generally only done for bad writing on a PPC fic.<br>Since you can still work on a fic in secret during the revocation, temporary revocation is not (as) viable.<br><br>Is there any other recourse we have for behavior we wouldn&#39;t like to encourage?

            <p>That is, things we have any kind of power to enforce. It&#39;s basically just bans.<br><br>I believe revocation of Permission has not been used as a consequence because Permission is not (formally) a badge of social merit, it&#39;s simply a checkmark in the box next to &quot;you can write stuff we want to read.&quot; Permission Givers are not mods, and we are not (formally) invested with the authority to judge anything besides one&#39;s ability to write missions. We&#39;re not going to give Permission to someone who has proven they can&#39;t function in the community before they request it—personally, I think the ability to get along with other PPCers is an indicator of the ability to grasp the kind of creativity and humor that makes missions work—but that said, I think we (certainly hS) would rather not blur the line any more than it is to begin with. We&#39;re Permission <i>Givers</i>, that&#39;s it.<br><br>There are also soft consequences, though, such as loss of respect and shunning (which is what&#39;s happening if a majority of the community avoids speaking to someone when they hadn&#39;t avoided them before). The trouble is, I don&#39;t think those tend to be very effective without explicitly saying that&#39;s what&#39;s happening, which we never have done, IIRC. It&#39;s too easy to rationalize away, especially since the Board doesn&#39;t move all that quickly all the time, and it requires that the subject be sensitive to that kind of social cue, which is often at the root of the problem to begin with.<br><br>I think informal social consequences are good and useful tools, but if they&#39;re not working, we need to recognize it&#39;s time to speak up clearly about what the problems are, not just let them go on festering. With proper dialogue, I believe most problems can be solved without resorting to hard consequences.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>... yes, it absolutely depends on what we&#39;re deciding.<br><br>We&#39;re lucky, here, that every case is unique. There are <i>always</i> unique circumstances to consider, and those affect how we handle things.<br><br>Look at the amendments to the Constitution. I passed the Fourth Amendment with five votes, because it was minor; I refused to pass the Third with six, because it was bigger than that.<br><br>My view is that for major things, it should be clear that the majority of the Board (fine, fine, &#39;PPC community&#39;) is at least vaguely in favour of changing the status quo. Ideally, that&#39;s because they all came out and voted, but that doesn&#39;t happen often. More commonly, you get a dozen &quot;for&quot; votes and a couple of &quot;against&quot;, at which point you have to assume that any silent people against it would step up out of fear of seeing their preferred option lose (since it isn&#39;t close).<br><br>There is no automatic triggering of a vote - a formal vote isn&#39;t even required! But if multiple people are objecting to something, there clearly isn&#39;t consensus.<br><br>I&#39;m going to do a little mind-reading, if you&#39;ll forgive me the presumption. :) You, Tomash, have struck me in the past few months as being someone who very much appreciates clear rules and, for want of a better term, legal process. There&#39;s been three or four incidents where you&#39;ve stood up (by email, here, or in the Discord) and said &#39;here is the evidence, let us pass judgement&#39; (paraphrased muchly).<br><br>And I sympathise with that. I have a <i>great</i> deal of sympathy with that - see exhibit A, this thread. But... this is the PPC, not a criminal justice system. The reason we don&#39;t have a firm list of crimes, court procedures, and punishments, is that... we don&#39;t actually <i>do</i> this all that often.<br><br>You. Data Junkie. ... yeah, y&#39;know what, that is the <i>entire list</i> of closely-debated ban votes that I can remember. Data Junkie&#39;s was manipulated by Data themselves undercover as a troll, and yours would&#39;ve been a slam-dunk no-ban (as were everyone else&#39;s) had you not been confessed guilty of something outside the remit of the Constitution.<br><br>And other than that? All the bans I can think of have been very clear, vast-majority decisions. This <u>is not a problem we have</u>.<br><br>I have comments on temporary bans, but for the sake of structure I&#39;ve <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?id=199610;article=307838;">put them elsewhere in the thread</a>. But they do somewhat link to this (in that they explain how I can say that, for instance, Zdimensia&#39;s ban was uncontroversial when there were a dozen different lengths proposed).<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I&#39;d like you to know you&#39;ve done a good job of reading my mind. I do like clear rules, well-defined processes, that sort of thing. <br><br>I completely agree that we don&#39;t have a problem with non-obvious ban vote results. Me and Data are the only two votes without a clear consensus result I can think of, and Data&#39;s had Torolling muddling everything up. Other than in those cases, it&#39;s been extremely obvious what we collectively want, so there&#39;s no point in trying to nail down specifics about how we vote. It also helps that, like you said, we don&#39;t ban people often.<br><br>My other concern was non-ban decisions. The example that was running around in my head was when we decided that it&#39;d be fine for me to be galloping around this thread. That was decided by a few approvals followed by a declaration that the decision was made about a day after the question was posed, along with general silence from everyone else. The process was almost uncomfortably fuzzy, but that&#39;s on my brain, not the community.<br><br>However, like you pointed out, if anyone objected, they would&#39;ve probably spoken out for fear of being outvoted. So it&#39;s actually reasonable to interpret silence as a weak vote in favor of whatever proposal is clearly winning. (That&#39;s a useful way to describe how we do things around here. Thanks.) This means we basically never have a problem with non-obvious decision-making results, which means there&#39;s no point to trying to codify a bunch of stuff in advance.<br><br>My only real quibble with what you said is the use of a majority standard for (at the very least) the major decisions like bans. A 50/50 split in the community doesn&#39;t feel like enough agreement to go forward on anything. Given that everything about how we make decisions is rather context-dependent, I&#39;d rephrase that to say that for major things, we need &quot;most&quot; of the community to be in favor of (or at least not opposed to) significant changes. <br><br>To give a concrete example, I&#39;d definitely consider there to be something off if we banned someone without at least 2/3rds votes in favor, and I&#39;d expect way more than that. This is why, when I counted the Glarn votes, I set the length of the semi-automatic temporary ban for breaking the formal last chance to 3 months (which had near-unanimous support) as opposed to a year (which had just 75% support).<br><br></p>

            <p>Well, a once and for all definition of consensus would be <i>nice</i>, but I&#39;m not convinced we can do it. It doesn&#39;t seem possible to completely answer that in advance, since it seems to be a rather case by case thing.<br><br>Given that, I guess my post was a really rambling way to touch off a general discussion about what a consensus looks like, and, probably more importantly, what there not being a consensus looks like.<br><br>Of course, the question is rather complicated because we can&#39;t tell the difference between &quot;I&#39;m not responding because I don&#39;t care&quot;, &quot;I&#39;m not responding because I concur and it seems pointless to add that&quot;, &quot;I&#39;m not responding because I haven&#39;t had time to&quot;, and &quot;I&#39;m not responding because I haven&#39;t seen the thread yet&quot;.

            <p>Since these have come up a few times in the thread and in emails I had setting it up, I think we need to discuss what these words actually mean. The following are what I think of when I hear them; I think it would be good to get a consensus on what everyone means.<br><br><b>Harassment:</b> a course of action which deliberately forces the victim to pay attention to you (whether by repeatedly trying to interact with them or by attacking them).<br><br><b>Stalking:</b> following the victim to new locations, for example, between chat channels.<br><br><b>Bullying:</b> a course of action taken with the intent of, or such that any reasonable person would anticipate, upsetting the victim.<br><br>In the last case, I think bullying has to be <i>repeated</i> (otherwise it&#39;s &#39;an attack&#39;, which is also bad, but different), and that something like &#39;I lash out when I get stressed/tired/depressed&#39; doesn&#39;t count unless you&#39;re deliberately putting yourself into situations where that lashing out will hit the same person again. Bullying, to me, is either deliberate, or willful ignorance of the consequences.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I don&#39;t have any coherent thoughts abut the proposed definitions right now.<br><br>However, there&#39;s something I&#39;d like to point out. As Sergio pointed out elsewhere, people can be unaware of their behavior. Specifically, I believe that it&#39;s possible for Boarder X to harass/stalk/bully/...

If nothing else, people here have their Article 7 chance to stop and apologize. This means that, before we hurl someone out the door for harassment/bullying/..., they need to have been clearly and explicitly warned that they were harassing/bullying/... someone, which includes telling them what behavior of theirs constituted harassment/bullying/... . If someone gets a warning like that and keeps doing the bad things, we can (and should) start talking about bans and the like.<br><br>I&#39;m not saying the victim has to give this warning.

            <p>Broadly I agree, but I think it&#39;s important to note that the behaviors are unwanted by the target. It helps very much if they can say so explicitly (e.g. &quot;Please leave me alone&quot;; &quot;Seriously, I said no, stop it&quot;), but since that&#39;s not always the case, it may fall to observers to discern as much.<br><br>With bullying, I definitely agree that it has to be a pattern of behavior, not just one or two dissociated incidents. I also think it&#39;s generally understood as an attempt to empower the bully by disempowering or enforcing the (perceived) lower status of the victim.

            <p>This may eventually turn into a ramble, but I feel like I should comment here about my experiences with these issues in the FBA. I think it might be helpful to bring up my experiences there since, honestly, some of these issues HS has laid out actually aren&#39;t issues that only the PPC has: in some form or another, the FBA has these issues too, and I&#39;ve gained perspective there that I think might be helpful to the PPC.<br><br>So yeah, I&#39;m gonna try to talk about some of of HS&#39;s stuff from all four categories, at least the ones I&#39;ve seen fit:<br><br>Keeping Issues Private: Honestly, the reason this is such a problem is because it&#39;s in some way tied to all of the other four things in this category. There are way too many factors for why someone keeps an issue private, and it&#39;s so dependent on the specific situation that I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a reliable systematic way to deal with all the possible scenarios. But honestly, what needs to be done here is to rethink the role of the administrator: do you engender a culture of trust, or do you just stamp down trouble in an attempt to keep it quiet? I think, in order to do any real problem solving, you have to engender a culture of trust, particularly if you&#39;re in charge of the circus. And on that front, hS, I actually feel this might be a crucial first step. On that note... <br><br>Ignoring Complaints: Mods, please don&#39;t do this. Ignoring complaints engenders mistrust between people, not to mention it basically sweeps an issue under the rug instead of solving it. On the first hand, people will generally only bring up their issues with someone to someone else they trust: it&#39;s been my experience in the FBA, and I think it applies to the PPC as well. And then on the other hand, ignoring a complaint today means that whatever issue is attached to it is guaranteed to blow up. So please, don&#39;t ignore complaints. Taking them seriously may not lead to solutions, but ignoring them will definitely lead to drama.<br><br>Assuming Authority: The FBA used to have a HUGE problem with this (it got so bad that a former contributor actually had to be banned from the project for a year because he broke a bunch of rules trying to assume too much authority), and in some ways the FBA still has that problem. And from my FBA experiences, I will say that HS&#39;s thoughts on this are absolutely right: having plans for canon isn&#39;t a problem as long as you talk to people about it first. Otherwise, don&#39;t complain when someone is displeased. As for people who assume authority in terms of issuing demands of people, I have four words for anyone who does that: &quot;swallow your goddamn pride&quot;. And I&#39;m actually going to differ from other people here and say that assuming authority should at least result in a slap to the wrist, if not operate on a three-strikes system that can lead to a ban: the people that assume authority usually will try to do so as often as they can get away with it, and it&#39;s not something that will go away on its own.<br><br>I will append a footnote to all of the above, though: I don&#39;t think assuming authority will ever be a truly big problem in the PPC. PPC canon is far too open for that to happen.<br><br>Argument from Oldbie: To be honest, I don&#39;t really think this is as much of an issue for the PPC as it used to be back in the IRC days, but I feel that discussion of this should really center on the issue of &quot;age as argument&quot;, because the other three forms generally don&#39;t happen, and if they do they&#39;re usually harmless. I will say, this is not exclusively a PPC problem, and this has a fairly easy source to pinpoint: it&#39;s generally an ego issue.<br><br>Battlefield Mentality/Lashing Out: Seeing as how I&#39;m probably the worst offender on Battlefield Mentality/Lashing Out, I&#39;m going to recuse myself from this conversation. (I did get banned from the FBA&#39;s Slack chat for two weeks over an incident that happened close to the New Year, after all: it&#39;s a very, very long story.) <br><br>Bad Conduct as a Beta: I&#39;m reluctant to suggest that this should come with disciplinary action. However, that conflicts with the part of me that says this should be considered an issue under the umbrella of assuming authority, since the people who try to impose their ideas on the story in question generally also have problems with assuming authority elsewhere. (And on a side note, HS: thank you for helping me pinpoint a huge problem I had with how someone did a thing!)<br><br>Not Taking Concrit: I&#39;ve actually seen one other reaction to concrit that wasn&#39;t good: the writer who holds concrit against people and uses it to say &quot;you&#39;re not worthy of my friendship, and I&#39;m going to use it to shut you up if you try to talk about my character again&quot;. Yes, I have seen that in action (trust me, it was not fun), though thankfully that reaction is exceedingly rare. All I will say is that if someone seems to not take concrit well, I think the best thing to do is to sit them down and tell them the usual spiel about concrit. If they take it, great! If not, well, there&#39;s not really anything anybody can do that, and I&#39;m not sure it should be considered a punishable offense.<br><br>So yeah, those are some of my thoughts there. I hope these are helpful.</p>

            <p>My only current comment on statute of limitations stuff is that dragging up that bad thing someone did years ago if it hasn&#39;t been a pattern of that kind of behavior since then is inappropriate.

This wouldn&#39;t be binding or anything, but it&#39;ll give us a potentially useful reference point for how to handle sufficiently similar situations that come up in the future.

            <p>Statute of limitations: I&#39;m sure no one will be surprised that I&#39;m against dredging up long-ago mistakes, considering I made the same argument last year.  Huinesoron&#39;s observation that our community has always been teenager-heavy is apt; we need to give people room to grow and change.  Honestly, I&#39;m not sure if assigning an arbitrary number value to the time required, or even a time guideline along the lines of hS&#39;s &quot;half their time at the PPC&quot; suggestion, is really going to help such situations.  It&#39;s very much a case-by-case matter; each separate situation will need to be looked into on its own.<br><br>Precedents: I . . . I&#39;m not too sure about setting precedents in such an official capacity.  Sorry to repeat what I just said in the other section, but I feel like it&#39;s more valuable to look at the facts of each issue that comes up for scrutiny than to have a set of rigid, &quot;this is the official response as per protocol&quot; reactions.  We&#39;re a small enough community that we basically all know each other, at least to some degree—even newbies, once they&#39;ve been active for a few weeks or so—and I feel like we&#39;re able to address a new problem based on the facts as its presented to us.<br><br>—doctorlit</p>

            <p>I completely agree there needs to be some sort of statute of limitations. However, your half-life suggestion would mean that the longer someone has been here, the longer their parole has to be in order for something to be dropped. If you or I managed to really offend someone, it could still be thrown in our faces for five or six years (!) after the fact. Even if someone&#39;s been here, say, four years, that&#39;s two where they have to be a saint if they don&#39;t want the old thing dredged up again.<br><br>I&#39;d say, if someone has gone a year without any repeat of the offensive behavior, that&#39;s probably a reasonable amount of time after which most things ought to be let go. That also means that if you&#39;ve got a grievance with someone, you&#39;ve got a full year to bring it up and seek a resolution or else get over it and move on. I would hope that adequately addresses the needs of both sides.<br><br>I&#39;m sure others will have different ideas, though.<br><br>~Neshomeh<br><br>P.S. I probably won&#39;t be able to contribute much until Thursday, when I have a day off. I am not abandoning the discussion. {= )</p>

            <p>... it sounds like you&#39;re saying that if someone attacks someone, apologises, then attacks them in the exact same way a year later, the victim shouldn&#39;t point at the first incident and say &#39;uh hang on they clearly just plain hate me&#39;.<br><br>Assuming the incident wasn&#39;t something that enters One Last Chance territory, which I guess would be different (but how different?

            <p>A thing we may want to keep in mind in the course of this discussion is that no rule can ever perfectly account for every hypothetical scenario. There&#39;s always going to be the potential for cases that fall outside the norm. So, we should try to cover what&#39;s most likely to occur, and not worry too much about the outside chances. If/when they come up, we should maintain the flexibility to interpret the rules as needed. That way we don&#39;t get ridiculously specific things like prohibiting unmarried women from parachuting on Sunday. (This is apparently a real law <a href="http://www.dumblaws.com/laws/united-states/florida">in Florida</a>.)<br><br>So, if the rule were a one-year statute of limitations, and we clearly observed someone deliberately waiting one year to harass someone, that would, IMO, give the rules against harassment precedence over the statute of limitations. It would reveal a level of cold, calculating malice that we would certainly not wish to tolerate.<br><br>Also, I think most things that would warrant an exception to the statute would be permaban-worthy in the first place. Threats, abuse, etc.<br><br>So, that&#39;s my case.<br><br>~Neshomeh<br><br>(Yay, shiny!)</p>

            <p><u><b>Battlefield Mentality/Lashing Out</b></u><br><br>Tending to happen as an effect of one of the other issues, this is where someone reacts to a perceived attack on themselves or another by getting highly aggressive.

But they are bad things that are technically already addressed by the Constitution. Addressing this is ultimately a two way street. The community at large must do better about immediately responding to incidents, and the people involved must do a better job of trying to keep feelings from getting the better of them.<br><br><b><u>Personal Issues Elsewhere</u></b><br><br>I… am very much torn on this. On the one hand, there are compelling arguments that what happens outside the community is meant to stay there, and vice versa. That being said, I&#39;m not comfortable with the idea of a member of the PPC acting reprehensibly elsewhere before slinking back here and pretending that all was well. If it&#39;s in the past, I&#39;m a little more okay with it. People can change. But otherwise… I don&#39;t know. I think a case-by-case approach would be for the best.</p>

            <p>Battlefield mentality: Oh, dear.  I was guilty of this to a terrible degree, back in the days of the old Mibbit chat room, especially when July criticized something I said.  It&#39;s still a source of embarrassment to me when I think about it.  July&#39;s views forced me to understand the world better, and evolve my opinions to be . . . uh, more moral/people-centered rather than ideal/concept-centered, I would say . . . but worse than fighting against my becoming of a better person, I was also fighting the person who has now become my closest internet friend.  And there isn&#39;t any way to take back all that stupid bickering on my part.  (I even just recalled a particular conversation where I was whining about not wanting my views to change, because I might be a different person afterwards.  Ye gods, but I was a pathetic little brat.)  I think if this behavior is occurring between two Boarders frequently, the community needs to ask the two to at least stop interacting in Board posts, role plays, etc., if not to encourage them to talk things out in private.  But everyone, take it from me: just don&#39;t do this.  Listen to the other person, get to know them.  You may be screwing yourself out of a most excellent friendship.<br><br>Personal Issues Elsewhere: A question that&#39;s both tricky and not tricky.  If it&#39;s a minor incident, or a long-ago incident, it&#39;s hardly this community&#39;s business, and I do expect the two involved to be responsible and not let their personal dispute leak out into Board space.  But if it&#39;s major, and let&#39;s be frank: I mean Jacer-nearly-driving-Lily-Gnome-to-suicide major, even if it had been years before either joined, that level of attack should not be tolerated, and the attacker should not be welcomed into this community.<br><br>Conclusion-jumping: The first type of jumping ties in with battlefield mentality above.  Use your words, talk to people, listen to them.  The second kind is the reason I often don&#39;t get involved in discussions of this sort, for fear of supporting the &quot;incorrect&quot; side of an argument—I certainly made a terrible mistake when I argued for allowing Data Junkie to return to the community, which caused a terrible amount of heartache for most of us.  The solution here is to, again, use our words, and make the involved parties use their words, and make sure we have the whole story from both sides before moving forward with any decision-making.  I&#39;m going to try to force myself to participate in future events of this nature.<br><br>—doctorlit, the betrayed</p>

            <p>(Not aimed specifically at doctorlit despite being in a reply to his post.)<br><br>While each of the incidents Ix describes are serious and bad, they are also each separate, unrelated, and very different. Please, <i>please</i> avoid the temptation to generalize disparate incidents into &quot;the PPC bullies people into suicide,&quot; because it&#39;s just not true. Most of us in our decade-plus history have absolutely never done that—and no one, as far as I know, ever did anything with the serious intent of driving anyone to kill themself.<br><br>I also know of at least two PPCers who have struggled with feeling suicidal for completely un-PPC related reasons, who received support from their friends in the community. I reckon there&#39;s more I don&#39;t know about, considering our demographics encompassing teenagers and young adults of whom a fairly high proportion are in some way outcasts in Real Life, whether it&#39;s because they&#39;re on the spectrum, or queer, or just people who care a lot about stories and writing in a society that generally doesn&#39;t.<br><br>If you want to make a generalization, say rather that we&#39;re a community with a long history of <i>welcoming</i> outcasts and giving them a place to call home when they might not otherwise have one. For that reason, it sure sucks a lot when that gets screwed up for someone, but I don&#39;t think the screw-ups define who we are. With the rare exceptions of individuals like Jacer and recently Date Junkie, most of us are here with good (or at least neutral) intentions toward our fellow PPCers. Let&#39;s not forget that.<br><br>Let&#39;s also remember that this thread is about helping us learn to resolve issues before they get to such a serious stage. I don&#39;t think we can do that by assuming anybody <i>wants</i> to hurt anyone else, as would be implicit in saying we have a culture of bullying here.<br><br>We really don&#39;t. We do have a lot of people who struggle with social interaction, though, who may need to be told clearly and more than once how to do things in a constructive manner. I keep barking about communicating clearly, and that&#39;s why. IMO, it&#39;s the only way we&#39;re going to help each other learn to do this &quot;social&quot; thing any better.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

I think that&#39;s a much more helpful thing to do than running around going on about how &quot;X is a jerk&quot;, and that it would resolve a lot of conflicts.

            <p><u>On Battlefield Mentality/Lashing Out</u><br><br>I also think this is pretty clearly addressed by the Constitution. Personal attacks are not acceptable under any circumstances; just because someone else has lowered themself to <i>ad hominem</i> doesn&#39;t mean we have to follow suit.<br><br>Unless a particular person does this all the time without remorse, though, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s necessarily punishable. We all get carried away and screw up sometimes. We just need to keep reminding ourselves and each other to take a deep breath and think before speaking. If you can&#39;t be civil, walk away until you can. If an issue is really very important to you, don&#39;t you owe it to yourself and the issue to make your case in a rational way?

On the one hand, nothing says that everyone in the PPC is required to be best friends with everyone else in order to participate.

            <p><u>Battlefield Mentality/Lashing Out</u><br><br>This is specifically highlighted in the Constitution (Article 3), and I feel it&#39;s something that should be dealt with at the time. I don&#39;t accept the idea that you shouldn&#39;t tell someone to calm down when they have a legitimate case against someone else, though I do acknowledge that doing so without also supporting that case is bad behaviour.<br><br>For past incidents where the person <i>has</i> backed down (afterwards), I don&#39;t think we need to look at it again now, though if they&#39;ve done it repeatedly it may be worthwhile.

            <p>Obviously no one approach is going to work for <i>every</i> possible issue. That&#39;s something that needs to be handled on a case by case basis. Possibly with some kind of noted scale of responses to specific incidents/behaviours? Stalking is infinitely worse than getting into an argument about a story, etc.</p>

            <p><u><b>Coordinating in Private</b></u><br><br>Sometimes, when someone does something that another person disagrees with, the latter will take to emails, PMs, or private chats to try and gather support for taking action against the perceived perpetrator. This may include individual or group discussions, and should probably include discussions on the Chat about incidents on the Board.<br><br><u><b>Assuming Authority</b></u><br><br>Sometimes members of the PPC create authority for themselves, issuing demands to other members of the community or to the PPC at large.

This is most obvious through the chat, but can also occur in private emails, or on the Wiki (because people don&#39;t generally browse the Talk pages).</p>

            <p>As the title says. I&#39;m going to start dividing these up into sections, as I have more concrete thoughts on these subjects going forward.<br><br><b><u>Coordinating in Private</u></b><br><br>Obviously, any sort of private collective action taken against one or a few members of the community should be discouraged. Like I said in my response to category four, if you have a problem with someone in the community then you should present it publicly and with evidence. Private coordination in general, however, isn&#39;t necessarily a massive ill. The Board is not necessarily the best place to hold a conversation, especially if you&#39;re trying to get your thoughts in order. Hashing out your thoughts with your friends can be especially useful. Like Phobos and Nesh said, intent is important.<br><br><b><u>Assuming Authority</u></b> and <b><u>Argument from Oldbie</u></b><br><br>I feel like these two can blend together in a strange sort of way. Let&#39;s be frank here: oldbies do have at least a small amount of unspoken authority. Not because of their length of membership, but because of their relevant experience. Experience should be used as a torch to lead the way, not as a club to pound a lesson into someone&#39;s head. Coming from the other side, newbies are not required to follow every word that spills forth from the mouth of an oldbie. They can chart their own path, make their own decisions, and find what works and what doesn&#39;t on their own.<br><br>As for the other aspects of these two points, I&#39;ll make things quick. Laying claims to parts of the PPC canon is obviously not great, but at the same time I agree with hS saying that anyone looking to make massive changes should coordinate with people who like to use that particular aspect of the PPC. Goodness knows I would like at least a little say if someone wanted to come in and make alterations to Bad Slash.<br><br>I don&#39;t think disciplinary action disparity between newbies and oldbies is much of a problem, if only because we barely get any disciplinary action done at all. Snideness aside, I would hope that in situations where some sort of measure must be taken, that the members of this community will put aside their concerns about length of membership or friendship and focus on the incident in question. Like Nesh said, it&#39;s about avoiding the battlefield mentality.<br><br><b><u>Splitting the PPC Community</u></b><br><br>I don&#39;t like the idea of someone creating a private PPC space, but at the same time our ability to control that is limited. I fail to see how the threat of a ban would convince someone who already wants to sort of split away. Perhaps activities to reemphasize community ties? I&#39;m not sure.<br><br>As for the second part of the question, I agree with Nesh and Phobos: there are decisions and then there are <b>decisions</b>. As the admin of the PPC Discord, much of the things I have to determine are either little things (someone wants a special color-coding for their RP group, someone wants a new emoji, etc.) or they are things that require an immediate response (the threat of bots posting CP, the wave of trolls that popped in about a month ago). Things that affect the entire community (or most of it, anyway) should be and would be taken to the Board.<br><br>((I will post my thoughts on the final two categories either late tonight or tomorrow.))</p>

            <p><u>On private discussion</u><br><br>I agree with a lot of folks that most sorts of private coordination aren&#39;t a problem. For example, there&#39;s nothing wrong with taking something you&#39;re going to propose to the community (like, say, a new FAQ section or a vote) and running it past a few people first to polish it up and check if it seems sensible. In addition, getting advice about something you&#39;re planning to do or say can be a very good thing. It&#39;s like beta reading for social interactions, and I don&#39;t think we should discourage that.<br><br>However, there are some sorts of private coordination that aren&#39;t good. One of the big ones I have a problem with is &quot;trial by rumor mill&quot;. This is where people are having conversations behind someone&#39;s back about how they&#39;re a bad person (or a bully, a jerk, etc.) that create a group within the PPC that thinks &quot;X is a [bad person, bully, ...]&quot;.<br><br>These trials by rumor mill are bad. They&#39;re bad for the community, since they lead to (eventual) drama and ganging up on people, or even the formation of pro-X and anti-X factions within the PPC. They&#39;re also rather useless, since it&#39;s a bit difficult to apologize, try to improve, explain yourself, or otherwise address concerns about your behavior if no one tells you there are problems. Also, from what I remember, this sort of thing has contributed to driving people out of the PPC, which shows that it&#39;s an issue that needs to be addressed.<br><br>So, we should ... not do this. However, doing things like this shouldn&#39;t unconditionally be grounds for a ban, especially it&#39;d be rather hard to pin down or enforce a rule against it. I&#39;m also not completely certain what we should do about these malignant subgroups when they form. My gut instinct is that we should calmly drag everything into the light so we can resolve it, but I think that merits further discussion, especially since there are tricky social considerations involved in slamming stacks of fuzzy allegations and attacks onto the Board.<br><br><u>PPC spaces</u><br><br>In the PPC, we have several spaces that we hang out in. The Board and the chat are the big ones, but there&#39;s several others, like the occasional game of Cards Against HQ or our former Minecraft server. We tend to self-segregate into these spaces, and this is, in general, fine (my long-term concerns about a Board-Discord culture split aside).<br><br>However, there is one sort of space I have a problem with: secret, long-term PPC spaces. That is, a space for PPCers to interact in, where they generally talk about the PPC, that&#39;s more than a temporary place for getting advice about something (or similar things like that), and that not everyone <i>can</i> join (if they want to). To give a concrete example: a PPC chat server for <i>just</i> you and your friends, especially if you don&#39;t tell everyone you&#39;re making it. <br><br>There&#39;s basically no good reason to make something like that. Don&#39;t do it. Seriously. <br><br>If you happen to hear about this type of space forming (it seems to happen every few years), please give whoever had the idea to do it a talking-to about how we don&#39;t do that here. If that doesn&#39;t work to stop it, bring it to the Board&#39;s attention so we can determine consequences as appropriate (probably not more than short taps with the banhammer if it&#39;s egregious and malicious).<br><br>On a clarifying note, private long-term spaces that aren&#39;t PPC related (say, everyone involved in an RPG putting together some sort of chat about the RPG to not clutter the Discord) are fine.<br><br>I&#39;m going to second what Neshomeh said about how there&#39;s decisions and <i>decisions</i>, and how not every small thing needs to be exposed to the Board, especially if the decision is about something internal to a particular space (such as the fiddly details of what should be rot13&#39;d in chat).<br><br><u>The chat</u><br><br>A lot of people (me included) have pointed out that the chat feels more private than the Board or the Wiki. There&#39;s also a common thought that this might contribute to bad behavior of some sort.<br><br>One aspect that makes chat feel more private, I think, is that you can&#39;t see what happened there historically without signing in. This is different from the Board and the Wiki, where anyone can quietly flip through the archives whenever they&#39;d like.<br><br>Therefore, I propose that (assuming there aren&#39;t fatal technical obstacles to this, which I don&#39;t think there will be) we publish the Discord&#39;s logs somewhere public, so people can look through them without making it obvious. <br><br>Some of the advantages to this are:<br><br>1. The existence of a &quot;click here for chat logs&quot; button might temper a tendency to witchhunt or flame people who aren&#39;t around (I don&#39;t think this is something that happens super-frequently, but it has happened before, and this might contribute to it not happening again).<br><br>2. If some topic gets discussed both on the Board and in chat, the discussion on the Board can more easily refer to or be informed by what happened in chat. I expect that such discussions will (and maybe should) happen, since getting advice from whoever happens to be around is one of the things that chat is for. Of course, for major decisions, the  discussion should be moved to the Board very quickly, but I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a problem with bothering chat with a &quot;Does this seem like something we need to talk about or is it just me?&quot; before writing the Board post.<br><br>3. It makes the Discord the same type of public as the Board and the Wiki are, so that the whole community can see all the public events that take place here if they want to. One reason this is important is that the goings-on in chat are part of the PPC&#39;s culture, and we don&#39;t hide our cultural artifacts or history. This is one of the reasons I proposed &quot;best of Discord&quot; threads about a month ago (unfortunately, the idea didn&#39;t take off). <br><br>A potential disadvantage is that there might be a chilling effect on the chat because it&#39;s a bit more obvious that everything&#39;s being logged. Publishing logs would also make it ever so slightly easier to go build cases against people (whether such cases are deserved or not), since it makes ancient chat logs a bit easier to go through.<br><br>Now, when it comes to this thread, there&#39;s been a request not to discuss it in the Discord, since that would move parts of the discussion off the record. I think it would be reasonable to relax the requirement slightly and say that, if you do discuss the thread in the Discord, please post the logs here on the Board shortly afterwards so we can get a clearer picture of how the metaphorical sausage that is community consensus is being formed.<br><br>- Tomash</p>

            <p><u>On Coordinating in Private</u><br><br>I agree with Phobos on this: it depends on the intent. Wanting to have the support of your friends in a difficult moment is one thing. Ganging up on someone to shut them up is another.<br><br>It also personally gets my back up when people who hardly ever post on the Board pop up out of nowhere to join in criticizing someone. That, to me, is a serious red flag signalling collusion with malign intent.<br><br><u>On Assuming Authority</u><br><br>I&#39;ve seen people acting entitled—to feedback, mostly—but I&#39;m not sure I&#39;ve seen anyone issue demands on the basis of imaginary authority. Can we have an example?<br><br>I do think people <i>are</i> entitled to a say when it comes to bits of the PPC into which they&#39;ve put lots of time and effort. That&#39;s just polite.<br><br>However, I also think you have to actively maintain your stake or give it up. I think you can expect people to respect your claims as long as you&#39;re active in the community, but you can&#39;t expect people to wait for you forever if you&#39;ve drifted away. When it comes to fic claims, developments on a storyline, or other things of that nature, at some point you have to nut up or shut up.<br><br><u>On Argument from Oldbie</u><br><br>a) I agree with Phobos on this one. I&#39;ve definitely seen people say things to the effect of &quot;I&#39;ve been down this road before and had X experience, so trust me when I say Y,&quot; which I think is perfectly valid even if it doesn&#39;t necessarily make them right about the present case. I can&#39;t say I&#39;ve ever seen a completely unqualified &quot;I&#39;ve been here longer than you, therefore I am right and you should do what I say without question.&quot;<br><br>b) I&#39;ve got a couple of quotes that sum up how I feel about this. &quot;Younger warriors are wise to listen to older ones. They&#39;ve lived.&quot; &quot;Keep an open mind, but not so open that your brain falls out.&quot;<br><br>In other words, it&#39;s probably smart to give some weight to the opinions of people who have a lot of experience with the thing under discussion, but it&#39;s never a good idea to turn off your critical thinking engine. If you do, it&#39;s not the oldbies&#39; fault.<br><br>c) This is actually a serious concern, but I&#39;m not too worried about it. First of all, the long-time members mostly get along with each other, and that&#39;s because of mutual respect and trust built up over years of association. We&#39;ve written together, debated together, created together, played together, and worked hard together for years, and we&#39;ve managed not to screw it up. So, like, if someone has been around a long time, it&#39;s pretty much because they care about this place and are a good person? People who don&#39;t care and aren&#39;t nice tend not to last.<br><br>I get that these close bonds between oldbies can make us appear as an impenetrable clique to newbies, but frankly, that&#39;s just too bad. I&#39;m not going to stop liking and associating with my friends of the past five years or more. You can become one yourself, though, if you care and are nice to be around. &quot;Oldbie&quot; is not actually an impenetrable clique, it&#39;s something you achieve by being around and participating positively without ticking people off all the time.<br><br>Cases in point: People assumed I was a PG long before I actually became one, simply because I was active on the Board and I made an effort to know what I was talking about and then to help out when newer people had questions. People also lumped Phobos in with the oldbies almost immediately after he joined, because he knew me and because he made an effort to know what he was doing and then acted like it. Iximaz was voted a PG after, what, a year? because she showed enthusiasm and made an effort to be knowledgeable and do well.<br><br>You can, too. And then, if one or another of us gets into trouble, you can help put us back in our place.<br><br>d) This also is a serious concern, and the one I think we can actually do the most about. See Battlefield Mentality and Jumping to Conclusions. And then don&#39;t do those things. {= )<br><br><u>Splitting the Community</u><br><br>Ehhhh, there are decisions and then there are <i>decisions</i>. Not everything needs the full participation of the whole community. I&#39;m thinking mostly of the wiki here, because that&#39;s where I have the most experience, but it applies to other spaces, too. Stuff like &quot;hey, can I add a link I think is relevant to this page?&quot; is probably okay to discuss on the article&#39;s talk page. The people most likely to respond there are also the people most likely to respond on the Board, because they&#39;re the only ones who actually care about the minutiae that much. {= P<br><br>Even a lot of the stuff I&#39;ve gotten up to over there, when it changes the format but not the content, I haven&#39;t always brought up on the Board, because honestly, nobody cares as long as they can get the information they want. (This, from what I can tell, is mostly information about badfics, particularly the Legendary ones. {= P ) And then when it comes to content, as long as I&#39;m adding and not removing it, that is something anyone can do as long as the content they&#39;re adding isn&#39;t spam or other garbage.<br><br>Things that may affect the perception of the PPC as a whole, though, or broadly change what content is available in what way, or broadly affect content that does not belong to me, I have brought up on the Board. (And mostly found that most people don&#39;t care, but I still do it.)<br><br>So I really think it&#39;s a matter of intent and degree.<br><br>Also, as someone else pointed out, a space can be available to everyone, but people will still self-select themselves out of it. Not everybody cares about the wiki; not everyone likes a live chat; not everyone enjoys RP or Cards Against HQ or <i>Minecraft</i> or whatever else you care to name that takes PPCers to other platforms. As long as what you&#39;re doing only has repercussions in that space, you&#39;re probably fine. If the repercussions grow broader, you should probably take it to a broader platform. The Board is the broadest platform. This is simple logic.<br><br>I&#39;ll reiterate, though, that if you don&#39;t regularly participate on the Board, but then pop up just to harangue someone, that&#39;s really not cool. {= /<br><br>~Neshomeh doesn&#39;t understand why the Citrus Scale page is so popular, with the second-highest number of views—highest after the main page—in the last four weeks. O.o</p>

            <p>Yeah, this can’t be said too often.<br><br>Since I don’t like to take more responsibility than is absolutely necessary, preferring a staff position over being a leader, I’m mostly glad when I come to the board, see what’s going on and find that I’m too late again, because &quot;somebody&quot; already did what needs to be done.

            <p>We see a different picture than the one you are painting.  Let us explain.<br><br>Link 1: Doing exactly what the Constitution says you should in this case.  Seriously.

            <p>(This subthread seemed like the most appropriate place to put this post, so here it is)<br><br>First, I agree with Neshomeh and PHobos.<br><br>I especially agree that more people need to start taking up leadership here. Specifically, it seems that the job of administering discussions (keeping things moving, counting votes, etc.) falls onto hS most of the time. Whyever this happened, it seems unfair to hS that we&#39;re collectively dumping most of the hard, annoying work of maintaining a consensus-based democracy onto him.<br><br>It also seems rather rude to sit around and blame hS for this state of affairs without doing anything about it. I claim that if you&#39;re unhappy about dictator!hS (I don&#39;t think this is a thing, but some people apparently do), you can &quot;usurp&quot; him by doing the same sort of things he&#39;s doing, at which point he&#39;s not the dictator anymore. There&#39;s no formal barriers to this, and I&#39;d like to think there aren&#39;t any social barriers either. (OK, if you&#39;ve only been around for, say, a week or two, you might get some funny looks because of how humans work, but other than that...)<br><br>On a related note, when it comes to calling out (or otherwise trying to address) bad behavior, each and every one of us has an Article 10 responsibility to participate in that if necessary. That is, if people are being idiots (see, uh, me, about a month ago, for example), don&#39;t wait for hS or another oldbie to call it out. We voted against mods, so the person responsible for speaking up about bad things is ... you.<br><br>Finally, because I don&#39;t anyone&#39;s said it yet and it needs saying, thank you, Huinesoron, for all the work you&#39;ve done over the years to keep this small corner of the Internet from falling to pieces.</p>

            <p>It&#39;s great that the newbies are participating, even though I also disagree with some of their points (I&#39;ll get around to expanding on that eventually).<br><br>My point was a bit more specific than that. Namely, that if someone effectively brand new were to, say, start the Concilliary or call and tally a ban vote, there might be some unease about that.

Direct democracy and all that. Now, if having one of the middlebies running this thread instead of you (but making the same posts) would make a significant difference in our collective behavior, then that&#39;s a potential issue (see, the &quot;impenetrable oldbie clique&quot; that some people claim exists).</p>

            <p>I actually made this list not to boost my own ego, but to see how well I was doing at demographics. One of which is... current status. So, of my 100 PPC characters (which excludes several of the &#39;descendant&#39; types who&#39;ve never actually shown up):<br><br>17 are dead.<br>11 are kids right now, with 3 more not yet born.<br>5 are retired, and two more are exiled.<br>5 are resident in HQ without being employed; another 4 are resident elsewhere (because they marry one of the children).<br>1 is insane.<br><br>Which leaves a whopping 52 who are active in the PPC, though that includes my DIA survivors of Crashing Down, for instance.

            <p>Private coordination:  This is tricky for me.  The behavior called out in this section is clearly in reference to last month&#39;s &quot;witch hunt&quot; that scared one of my closest PPC friends away from the community.  It was a terrible thing that shouldn&#39;t have happened.  But there&#39;s a matter of degrees that make it hard to pinpoint where this becomes a toxic behavior, and where it&#39;s mere discussion.  Speaking as someone who has difficulty trusting his own judgment, if I were ever feeling harassed by another in this community, I would second-guess that that was the intent behind their behavior.  I would never even consider making a formal complaint on the Board without talking privately to folks I trust beforehand to see if they had noticed anything off as well.  Last month&#39;s situation was confronted and met with chastisement, as it should have; but do we really want to condemn people discussing problems in private, or in the Lounge, just in the form of people talking to each other?  (Should I be punished for talking about events at work with my coworkers?)<br><br>Community splitting: I think this is the complaint in this thread that I take the most issue with.  I&#39;m personally just unable to see where the line is drawn.  The example Huinesoron gives in his post above is that this &quot;. . . doesn&#39;t include having a private chat with someone, or even several someones, but is about making a new PPC forum, chatroom, or other such location . . .&quot;  What&#39;s the difference?  How is a &quot;private chat with several someones&quot; different than a new chatroom?  What about missions on LiveJournal behind friend-locks, that those of us without LJ accounts can&#39;t read?  What about the old PPC <i>Minecraft</i> server, which those of us without the game couldn&#39;t play?  The fact is, people just interact with each other, through whatever means they have available.  And they&#39;re entitled to talk about community decisions in those spaces.  (Not <i>make</i> them, but certainly talk about them!)<br><br>— doctorlit needs to go to work, and will address the rest of this section&#39;s points when he gets a chance</p>

            <p>Assuming authority: A long time ago (and it&#39;s far too close to bedtime to search for it), Neshomeh said something along the lines that even if permission givers don&#39;t have any official authority in this community, they still lead by example.  This is unavoidable in any situation where one human has been doing something longer than another.  (Imagine if, say, the PPC had never developed into a community, and the last three months&#39; worth of newbies had happened across the <s>deleted</s> Original Series in 2017, and tried start a writing community around it.  How would they even go about it?  Actually, don&#39;t imagine, because now I&#39;m starting to make an AU in my mind . . .)  And in spite of leading by example, they still <i>don&#39;t</i> have official authority; if anyone here started trying to &quot;take over,&quot; they would be summarily ignored, and we would all continue doing as we&#39;ve been doing.  The only punishment necessary would be the lack of trust and respect that individual had engendered for themselves.  Moving on to the matter of &quot;staking claims:&quot; This does get a little difficult in a mass multiplayer setting, doesn&#39;t it?  On the one hand, one person shouldn&#39;t be locking up design and development space from the rest of the community, other than their own characters and plot arcs.  On the other hand, it would suck for an element to get changed by one author when another author was in the midst of working something that said something else . . . Full disclosure: I&#39;m currently terrified that someone is going to name the head Flower of the Cafeteria before I can get a story draft I&#39;m working on through beta stages to publish, because my story literally hinges on that Flower being the kind of Flower he is.  (For the record, I did ask Vixenmage, the only other current author with Cafeteria characters, for permission before going forward with the story.)  Ultimately, as another poster somewhere above or below said, if you&#39;re planning something in the setting, either do it, or don&#39;t complain.  <s>But please no one beat me to the Cafeteria head.</s>  Again, I don&#39;t think a formal punishment is necessary (assuming the claim-staking didn&#39;t devolve into bullying); the setting, and its other creators, will steam-roll past the offender.<br><br>Oldbie speak: I guess I covered a bit of this in the above section.  I&#39;ll admit that I&#39;m typically a bit mistrustful of newbies until I&#39;ve gotten to know them for a while.  But I&#39;ve also seen times when (relative) newbies have joined in to debates, games, discussions, RPs, etc. with energy and strong will.  I think we are quicker to chastise newbies when they do something out of line, but that&#39;s partly a form of showing our newest members the ropes of the community in which they find themselves.  I&#39;ve also seen oldbies talk each other down when one crossed the line.  Ultimately, it&#39;s a matter of each of us reading the words/actions being said/done, and not the name behind them, and responding with an appropriate reply.<br><br>—doctorlit noticed earlier today that he passed over section 2.  He will return to that next time he has time to type.</p>

            <p>1) I don&#39;t know that Coordinating in Private is necessarily a problem.  I mean, don&#39;t get me wrong, it can absolutely be as you&#39;ve described, but it isn&#39;t always (or often?) the case.<br><br>I think it all boils down to intent and what does this coordination look like? For example:<br><br>&quot;Hey, I&#39;m having issues with this person/story/activity, can you give me some advice?&quot;  Totally fine.  Asking someone, in private, to advise you before you take action or say something is a really good idea if you are unsure how to proceed.  I know that some PGs do this *cough*me-and-Nesh-in-our-apartment*cough* if we don&#39;t know how to approach a specific permission request or issue.<br><br>&quot;Hey, come back me up with this person/story/activity, I feel like I&#39;m the only one speaking up.&quot;  Probably fine.  Asking someone you know feels a certain way to speak up can sometimes be necessary.  We have a tendency to stay quiet when we&#39;re uncomfortable and we tend toward introversion.  This is part of why important topics drop off with no resolution as often as they do.  Just be careful that this doesn&#39;t turn into this next example.<br><br>&quot;Hey, this person/story/activity needs to not be talking/happening anymore, help me shut them/it up/down.&quot;  Not fine.  Enlisting people to attack someone or something you don&#39;t like is Not Cool.  The major difference between this and the &quot;Probably Fine&quot; example is that this is gathering an army to silence, while the other is gathering voices in an attempt to be heard.<br><br><br><br>I guess the point I am trying to make is that taking to emails, PMs, and private chats is a necessary tool for communication on the internet.  It can allow people to, for instance, anonymously voice their concerns through a third party *cough*this-thread*cough* if they feel uncomfortable bringing them up themselves.  It can be a path toward making one&#39;s-self heard, if done properly.  And I don&#39;t want to do anything that might make that harder.<br><br><br>2) I can see how Assuming Authority over a piece of the community or canon can be a problem, but I don&#39;t think it is one we currently suffer from.  If I&#39;m wrong on that, someone please let me know.<br><br>3) Argument from Oldbie is complicated, isn&#39;t it?  Let&#39;s break it down.<br><br>3a) I don&#39;t believe I&#39;ve seen anyone say anything even remotely like &quot;We should do this because I say so, and I&#39;ve been around since the Stone Age.&quot;  What I have seen is people using their relevant experience as part of an argument.  Something akin to &quot;I don&#39;t think we should do (Thing).  We tried (Thing) back in the Stone Age and it was a huge mess.&quot;  That&#39;s not a bug, it&#39;s a feature.  I think it is right that Oldbies should use their experience in the community to help inform newer members of the community&#39;s history when making decisions as a group.<br><br>3b) This one may be true.  There is a tendency among newer members of the community to get stars in their eyes when someone who&#39;s stories they&#39;ve enjoyed talks.  This may cause them to give preference to that person&#39;s arguments.  However, I have two problems with the assumption that this will happen.  Firstly, the idea that there is anything we can do about it.  I don&#39;t think there is.  Secondly, the idea that even star-stricken Newbies will blindly follow someone who has no real point.  It is a disservice to Newbies to think that way.<br><br>3c&amp;d) I think these both go back to something Nesh said recently, it is easier to give the benefit of the doubt to someone you know the character of.  The longer someone is around, the more of their character we get to see.  <br><br>That said, these two points have never really been relevant until recent years.  We were pretty good about being civil and respectful, so there was little need for punishment.  This is troubling, but I don&#39;t have any idea how to fix it.<br><br>4a) I agree with Delta Juliette that people who make an exclusive space tend to have a reason they did it.  I think that is the absolute wrong way to deal with their reasons, but they do have them.<br><br>4b) I think making decisions for the group, in an exclusive location, is not good.  That said, I am a fan of getting a small group of like-minded individuals together and saying &quot;we all believe that (topic) is a problem, what are some solutions that we can present to the community?&quot; before then making a post about it and offering your solutions for discussion.  Again, it depends on intent.  If the intent is to get your thoughts together and then present to the community, then fine.  If your intent is to get your thoughts together and then try and dictate to the community, then not fine.<br><br><br><br>Anyway, I&#39;ve gone on quite long enough here.

            <p>In the majority of cases that I can think of, the people who have been looking for support in private or setting up new spaces for part of the community have been responding to bigger problems - they&#39;ve felt attacked, or harassed, or generally made unwelcome in some way or another. Those situations seem far more significant to me than how people respond to them - if people are trying to get help dealing with a problem, or trying to stay in the community but get away from a problem, we need to be dealing with the problem itself.<br><br>I suspect that a lot of the issues we have with dealing with problems fall under Category 4&#39;s Abandoning Discussion. People don&#39;t want to start something if they know it&#39;s going to get dropped without any resolution - so both coordinating and splitting strike me as behaviors to get around having yet another discussion that&#39;s just going to get abandoned without solving anything. (I will post more over there about abandonment and resolution.)<br><br>So - I really disagree with having default punishments for these - especially Coordinating and Splitting really seem like they could be symptoms of a bigger problem rather than a root problem itself. When they are the root problem, of course, they should be dealt with.<br><br>Final thought: I really don&#39;t like the implication in Coordinating that the chat shouldn&#39;t talk about things that happen on the board. The chat is a part of the community, is it not?</p>

            <p>I agree that we need to look at the cause of the decision, but I disagree that that means we should disregard the action itself. If I sent round an email to a couple of dozen oldbies that said &quot;The current crop of newbies can&#39;t spell to save their lives, and think Warhammer 40K is a model for how they should build their agents; let&#39;s make a New PPC Board to preserve the good part of the community&quot;, we would certainly want to look at why the newbies are like that - but I&#39;d hope we&#39;d also slap me down hard for trying to split up the community, rather than just brushing that off.<br><br>That goes double if what I was saying was &quot;I&#39;m fed up of these can&#39;t-spell-hammer newbies telling me to stop gossiping about them (when frankly they deserve it); let&#39;s make an etc etc etc&quot;.<br><br>Both of these situations are purely hypothetical, and deliberately tuned not to mirror specific real-life events.

            <p>If it&#39;s something more akin to &quot;the chat server is always super crowded and someone&#39;s usually ticked off, I think I&#39;m going to make a second space where people can take a bit more time to discuss things deeply&quot;, that&#39;s a very different situation.

            <p>Okay, big assumption first: I am assuming that when you said that splitting attempts &quot;should probably be whacked with a hammer&quot; you&#39;re referring to the Banhammer and saying that we should codify such as our response to splitting. If this is not the case, please say so and feel free to disregard as much of this post add you like.<br><br>My point is more that the scenario you&#39;re talking about requires:<br><br>A: the creation of a seperate but still ostensibly PPC space<br>B: by a faction of existing PPCers<br>C: with intent to exclude some non-faction-members<br>And presumably D: with intent to enable organisation against the excluded<br><br>This seems to me to be a very specific sort of hypothetical, and I really dislike the idea of setting some sort of blanket punishment for situations that the punisher believes fits the criteria. This is for a couple of reasons:<br><br>1: I really don&#39;t think that a situation that specific is likely to repeat itself exactly enough that we can prescribe a course of action from this discussion<br>2: let&#39;s be honest, we&#39;re taking about a hypothetical repeat of #ppc2 and I don&#39;t think that applying the banhammer would have been the right thing to do then either<br>3: I dislike the idea of requiring punishment on that scale, it strikes me as very un-PPC.<br>4: a rule calling for application of the Banhammer by default encourages immediate action, which could easily happen before the Nameless Admin has the knowledge to react justly.<br><br>I am of the opinion that splitting is most likely to show up as a symptom of larger concerns, and should be investigated as such. If people are creating a new wiki to conspire against PPC Canon and the Permission Givers, that conspiracy and the reasons behind it are far more important than the artifact of the new wiki. If people are creating a new Discord server to get away from Maslab and my bombarding the server with cute cat pictures, the problem is really with Maslab and I, no?<br><br>So, you are correct, I do not believe that splitting is a situation that requires immediate action against the splitters. I believe that splitting is a very serious warning sign that things have gone wrong, and we need to get to the bottom of it and heal the rifts in our community with urgency. I believe that that healing may require banning, I don&#39;t want to take that tool off the table. But when something is breaking apart, just hitting it with a sledgehammer is usually not the right solution.<br><br>Ultimately, a split in technology is an echo of a split in the community. That has the potential to be a much, much more nuanced situation than &quot;these people are Bad and must be banned.&quot;</p>

            <p>1/ I&#39;m not specifically saying it needs a ban, but I am saying that it should be stopped quite harshly.<br><br>2/ We&#39;re not talking about a hypothetical repeat of #ppc2, as it happens. We&#39;re talking about the actually-happened event where, at the time when it looked possible a bunch of people were going to be banned from the Discord over the witch-hunt, one of those people created a separate PPC Discord for the sole purpose of circumventing the ban.

            <p>1) The point I&#39;m still trying to find words for here is that I really feel that a split in technology is a symptom of a split in the underlying community - enough people are upset enough about something that they feel like they need a separate space. This is inherently not a situation where we can just say &quot;that is bad&quot; and apply punishment- all that doing so is going to do is drive those people further away.<br><br>2) Ah, right, I&#39;d forgotten that one. Yeah, that was decidedly not cool - declaring intent to facilitate ban-dodging, or some such?<br><br>But at the same time, it was an overreaction to, IMO, an overreaction: &quot;let&#39;s just <i>ban everyone</i>&quot; was shot down pretty hard by multiple people, and that was the context in which Granz said &quot;what the hell, no, I like this community and I think that&#39;s ridiculous&quot;.<br><br>3) I was being a bit silly with my example - to be more serious, say that Maslab and I are making some people feel excluded, and we&#39;re ignoring the normal mechanisms that should be telling us that such isn&#39;t cool? That goes beyond &quot;I am interacting with the community in a way it doesn&#39;t like&quot; and escalates right up to &quot;I am flagrantly violating the constitution&quot;, and people calling me out for doing such isn&#39;t so much an attack as it is the right thing to do? (Obviously, there are right and wrong ways to call people out, the list goes on, etc.)<br><br>&quot;People attacked you so you must have needed attacking&quot; is fundamentally invalid, I agree; it&#39;s classical victim-blaming and IMO demonstrates a pretty solid lack of interest in actually solving the conflict at hand.</p>

            <p>Coordinating in private: I&#39;m not sure about this one. It seems entirely reasonable that someone who feels wronged will first seek comfort and support from those close to them before bringing their case before an authority. It seems asinine to tell people &quot;no, you can&#39;t talk to your friends first; you have to immediately put your issues up on the Board so we can all pick your case apart&quot;.<br>On the other hand, it is entirely possible for someone to coldly (or even accidentally) use their victim status to turn the tables, if you will, on the perpetrator. When this spreads to the wider community, you get what happened last month, which I&#39;d rather not see repeated.<br>I don&#39;t think there&#39;s an easy line to draw between acceptable and unacceptable here. I do, however, think that the problem ties in with the next point.<br><br>Splitting the community: Let&#39;s face it: we&#39;re already pretty split. Even when a space is open to all PPCers, that doesn&#39;t mean that all PPCers will use it, which creates basically the same end result.<br>I think important decisions, including all dispute resolution, need to happen exclusively on the Board. I also definitely agree that deliberately creating a &quot;PPC&quot; space for only a limited selection of PPCers should be whacked before it gets going.<br>...but I also see a problem here. Anyone wanting to create a space for their PPC friends and themselves can do that - we can&#39;t stop them, unless they label it as a PPC thing (and we can&#39;t even stop that; we can only whack them with a hammer).<br>Man, I wish everything was easy.<br><br>Assuming authority: I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve seen anyone do this for themselves, but I know I am guilty of sometimes giving more weight to the words of people like Nesh and hS simply because it&#39;s them saying it than I otherwise might. Of course, it helps that they tend to be extremely thoughtful and reasonable.<br>I&#39;d definitely be unimpressed by anyone trying to claim authority here (unless it was God-Emperor hS finally claiming his rightful place :-p )<br><br>Argument from oldbie: I agree with hS: the far more likely bias is how much you know and like someone. It&#39;s just that all the oldbies know and like each other, so there may be a perception of them always banding together against the newbies. I think this comes down to everyone having to recognise their own biases. I don&#39;t think it is a genuine problem.<br><br>(Oh, because we&#39;re the PPC: hS, hierarchical has the i before the e.)</p>

            <p><b>Coordinating in Private:</b><br>I have no thoughts on <i>colluding</i> in private, save that it probably deserves a slap on the wrist, at the very least. However, I have a question of what this means in terms of organizing the various RPG games that some of us play. Should they be hosted exclusively on the Board or the Dischord? On one hand, this runs the risk of attracting excessive amounts of players, which bogs down games. On the other hand, these games are in many ways similar to the regular rp that happens around here.<br><br><b>Assuming Authority &amp; Argument from Oldbie</b><br>I consider these two issues to go hand-in-hand. I have this habit of blindly following people who act like they are in charge. I would appreciate actions to be taken to counteract this. A possibly horrible idea to remedy this is to detach the names from the arguments. Perhaps we had a plugin that altered the Board. Instead of names showing up next to comments, what if we had colors? When the page is refreshed, each unique name would be assigned a random color. This would help make all arguments equal while running the risk of turning into a dystopia.<br><br><b>Splitting the PPC Community</b><br>This is a dangerous issue. Our community is a small one, and I fear fracturing it could lead to grave consequences. I say splitting the community should call for a temporary ban. This might be a bit extreme, but anyone willing to split the community probably isn&#39;t very close to it.</p>

            <p><u>Coordinating in Private</u><br><br>I really dislike this kind of thing. There can be legitimate reasons to do this - I remember a few Permission Giver email chains which went &#39;this person has been turned down so many times, what are we doing wrong/how can we get the point across&#39;, and I&#39;ve seen a few &#39;this person is upset, pls email them&#39; in my time - but when it&#39;s used to attack someone or stir up resentment against them it&#39;s just... bad. Don&#39;t do it. :(<br><br>I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s punishable. I don&#39;t know if it <i>could</i> be, unless it happens in the Chat. If it is, I think it&#39;s probably better to focus on the actual behaviour (talking about people behind their backs) than the specific nature of it.<br><br><u>Assuming Authority</u><br><br>I recuse myself from the first half of this discussion. :-/ For the second: I think saying &#39;I&#39;ve done a lot of work with this concept, so please talk to me before changing anything&#39; is okay. Saying &#39;I have plans for this so lay off&#39; isn&#39;t. But it&#39;s not bannable.<br><br><u>Argument from Oldbie</u><br><br>I... honestly haven&#39;t seen this. I remember a bare handful of people shutting down requests for them to calm down with &#39;you weren&#39;t there, you don&#39;t know how bad it was&#39;, but apart from that I don&#39;t think this is an actual thing. When someone behaves badly, we make them apologise, whoever they are.<br><br>A far more likely bias is &#39;how much you like/know someone&#39;. A relative newbie who&#39;s on the Discord can get a lot of support against an oldbie who stays on the Board, whichever side is right, purely because the Discorders (Discordians?) know them better.<br><br><u>Splitting the PPC Community</u><br><br>I feel this is bad behaviour.

            <p><u><b>Keeping Issues Private</b></u><br><br>With alarming frequency, people are popping out and saying &#39;I&#39;ve had so many problems with this person!&#39;, when the PPC community as a whole hasn&#39;t had a clue about it. What can be done to help people raise their problems sooner, rather than letting them build up?<br><br><u><b>Ignoring Complaints</b></u><br><br>Sometimes, when someone raises a concern, whether because of the way they do so, the personalities involved, or other discussions cutting in over them, those concerns are not discussed. Obviously this needs to avoid <u>Jumping to Conclusions</u>; a middle ground is needed.<br><br>This also includes the possibility that complaints which do not include specific allegations and/or a specific call for action can be ignored.<br><br><u><b>Abandoning Discussion</b></u><br><br>The Constitution specifically makes resolving issues the responsibility of everyone in the PPC community. Despite this, discussion of many incidents tends to peter out before a conclusion is reached. If someone is refusing to apologise for their actions, but is doing so without attacking anyone else - particularly if they have been attacked during the discussion - it is rare for anything to be done about it.<br><br>Equally, when several votes are called in succession, the later ones get far fewer votes, whether or not they are as important as the earlier.<br><br><u><b>Bearing Grudges</b></u><br><br>If someone has acted badly, recognised that they have done so, and sincerely apologised, the Constitution makes it clear that they get a second chance. On occasion, people have brought incidents like this up much later, revealing that they did not consider the situation resolved. The acceptability of this may depend on whether the apology was explicitly accepted at the time.<br><br>Covered under this is the question of how long has to pass before someone can be assumed to have changed, and therefore (absent other evidence) it&#39;s unreasonable to throw the same thing in their face despite the time passing.<br><br>As part of this discussion, it might be good to consider whether the &#39;second chance&#39; concept requires a formal warning, or whether it can be assumed to be delivered along with the apology.<br><br><u><b>Lack of Reform</b></u><br><br>When someone does something that isn&#39;t itself One Last Chance/banworthy, but does require an apology, there is an expectation that they will improve their behaviour after apologising. If they continue in the same fashion afterwards - either immediately or after an interval of better behaviour - it is rare that anything new is done about it.<br><br>This may be coupled with attempts to downplay their previous actions. It may also lead to their apologies being considered insincere.</p>

            <p>First off, let me apologize for not saying anything in this thread in a more timely manner. RL has a way of making me feel tired and demotivated as of late. But that&#39;s beside the point.<br><br>Most of the issues in this particular category, to my eye, are not ones with easy solutions. It is not as if adding more rules to the Constitution will finally change how people react to major events. It&#39;s all very well and good to say &quot;don&#39;t hold grudges,&quot; but trying to get people to actually do that is another thing altogether. As Tomash said, changing someone&#39;s thought process is not a quick and easy thing to do.<br><br>The recommendations I do have are ones that have already been brought up. If you have a complaint, bring it up to the community immediately. The <i>entire</i> community, and not just your immediate circle. Be specific. Provide evidence. Get involved with discussions. If someone gives an apology, take it as sincere in the moment. If that apology later proves to be hollow, however, then some sort of action should be taken.</p>

            <p>Keeping issues private isn&#39;t, as other people have pointed out, an issue that can be fully solved.<br><br>However, if we ignore complaints, or are perceived as ignoring them, it will influence people towards keeping their issues private. If you expect that a public complaint won&#39;t do anything, or might even make things worse by generating a bunch of drama, you&#39;re not going to make one. <br><br>We do actually tend to ignore complaints (possibly unintentionally), especially if there&#39;s not one specific alleged egregiously bad thing that&#39;s being complained about or if there&#39;s a whole bunch of other discussion going on at the time. <br><br>Solutions? Not sure. Pulling the less-discussed complaints out of a big pile of drama and discussing them a while later  like I think we should eventually do here is probably a good move. Also, even though, like Nesh said, form matters, if someone&#39;s making a not-entirely-specific complaint, it might be good to ask clarifying questions instead of shrugging and moving on.<br><br>Also, just because we haven&#39;t been asked to <i>do</i> anything doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s not a complaint.<br><br>As to abandoning and/or not joining discussions, please don&#39;t do this if you can avoid it. Among other things, it contributes to perceptions that we don&#39;t care about complaints.  Obviously, there&#39;s this thing called real life that might limit the time you have to be involved in PPC discussions, but I don&#39;t think that&#39;s the sole explanation for our high abstention rate. <br><br>If you&#39;re hesitating to step into a thread because it&#39;s a big argument or debate and you&#39;re not quite sure what&#39;s going on or which &quot;side&quot; to take, that&#39;s the signal for you to go in there and ask the people involved to explain things to you.<br><br>Bearing grudges is not a good thing for people to be doing around here. However, I suspect that some of those grudges come from complaints that were ignored, which makes them somewhat understandable. On the other hand, if someone does apologize and try to do better and you don&#39;t accept that, that&#39;s not their problem. It&#39;s yours.<br><br>Repeated bad behavior, especially if it&#39;s unrepentant, isn&#39;t a good thing. However, it&#39;s important to remember that, a lot of the time, reform involves changing thought patterns, and that&#39;s not an easy or quick process, and that, despite someone&#39;s bast efforts, there might be some backsliding. Therefore, these &quot;patterns of behavior&quot; cases need to be considered on a case by case basis. <br><br>In general, if people offer apologies, they should either be accepted or, if they seem insincere or otherwise not valid, that should be stated explicitly to prevent miscommunications. Furthermore, if you don&#39;t think the apology you got is enough repartitions for whatever it is happened, please say so instead of stewing about it silently. Sure, it might cause drama, but I think that&#39;s better than the alternative.</p>

            <p><u>On Keeping Issues Private</u><br><br>No clue what can be done here. It&#39;s basically up to the person with a problem to decide for themselves whether they value trying to solve the problem more than not solving it. It&#39;s a matter of weighing the potential risks and rewards of each course of action, deciding what&#39;s worth it to you, and then living with the decision.<br><br><u>On Ignoring Complaints</u><br><br>Well... I agree with the text of the original post? Specific complaints should be discussed without jumping to conclusions.<br><br>I guess I should note that I think form matters, though. If you want to be taken seriously, it helps to present your concern in a serious, straightforward manner. You can&#39;t expect people to read your mind and magically know you have a serious problem if you only talk vaguely around it or act like you&#39;re joking or don&#39;t really care that much. It&#39;s also not particularly fair to throw a huge fit and then get offended when people suggest you might be overreacting.<br><br><u>On <s>Never Even Joining</s> Abandoning Discussion</u><br><br>... You know, I don&#39;t think I can talk about this without ranting right now. Too many personal feelings regarding recent (and current) events.<br><br><u>On Bearing Grudges</u><br><br>I think this refers up to Statute of Limitations and Keeping Issues Private. If you&#39;ve got a problem with someone and you don&#39;t do anything to resolve it, at some point you have to accept the consequences of that decision and move on.<br><br>I don&#39;t think strictly encoding the &quot;second chance&quot; thing is probably wise. People are complicated, behavior is nuanced. A little more wiggle-room might be acceptable for someone with more challenges to overcome, less acceptable for someone who can reasonably be expected to know better.<br><br>It depends on the severity of the offense(s), too, though. Some things may exhaust the Board&#39;s collective patience more than others.<br><br><u>On Lack of Reform</u><br><br>Again, people are complicated, behavior is nuanced. Unrepentant bad behavior should certainly not be ignored, but backsliding, even repeated backsliding, on the part of someone who is legitimately doing their best might be worth tolerating if we find them otherwise agreeable. It&#39;s hard to encode this sort of thing into a specific response or set of responses. It&#39;s got to be case by case.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Ignoring Complaints and Abandoning Discussion really strike me as being fundamental problems that we need to address - every time we do them, and we do them a lot, people get hurt and we say &quot;eh, whatever.&quot;<br><br>They&#39;re also pretty fundamental problems in a consensus-based internet community, unfortunately. These sorts of discussions, though important, are not terribly fun, and they have to grind on for a long time before we reach consensus on anything that isn&#39;t straightforward. And I think we do value consensus here - there were a couple of votes in the last major drama threads to the tune of &quot;there is no consensus therefore I vote for no action.&quot; So, when a conversation is not fun, and everyone&#39;s had their say, it&#39;s easy for the quorum needed to drift away rather than building consensus.<br><br>I don&#39;t have the best of solutions. However, I&#39;ve been here before, kinda - my previous team at work had a very similar problem. Everyone cared about everything. Everyone wanted to have their say on everything. We had meeting after meeting where everyone sat around and ground through all the options and possibilities for honestly trivial stuff, because everyone was invested in the project.<br><br>So what we did was we took a leap of faith. We agreed that A, we all cared about the project as a whole, and that B, we trusted each other, both to make good decisions and to take problems to the right group of people. And so we agreed that, in practice, we didn&#39;t actually need consensus on most things. We&#39;d brainstorm options as a group, bounce them off of each other at large - and then give the problem to whoever was the expert in that section of the project. They&#39;d usually bring in a few people - either experts in related sections, or newbies to give a fresh set of eyes, or both - and we went with their decision.<br><br>That was a bit scary the first few times. We were giving things that we really cared about away - and then it worked, and worked again, and we got used to it.<br><br>I don&#39;t know if something similar would work here, but I&#39;d be willing to give it a shot. I would trust the majority of the community here to fairly resolve a dispute I found myself in, or recuse themselves if they couldn&#39;t do so fairly. It&#39;s a big leap, but... I believe in us?<br><br>Just a thought.</p>

It was, in fact, the one point I said we shouldn&#39;t be discussing in this thread (though no, I didn&#39;t reiterate that in the thread itself), because it has recently and emphatically been resolved.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I&#39;m pretty sure we don&#39;t need to have a specific moderator title or job - indeed, doing so seems like a very bad idea. But if, say, I had done something bad, I would be equally comfortable with a small group of fellow Boarders deciding my fate (preferably who have shown themselves to be mature? Although I&#39;d also value fresh blood on said panel too to minimize groupthink) as I would with a whole-community consensus vote. I think a smaller, more intense discussion would be more likely to come to a conclusion than a broad one.</p>

            <p><u>Keeping Issues Private</u><br><br>I don&#39;t <i>know</i> what we can do about this. We&#39;ve rewritten the Constitution so many times to try and highlight it. Heck, even this thread&#39;s precursor barely got a handful of replies, and I can hardly believe that they&#39;re the only outstanding issues. I don&#39;t know.<br><br><u>Ignoring Complaints</u><br><br>I agree that this is a problem, and that the desire to not stir up more trouble is probably mostly responsible. We need to be sharper on this - probably not immediately if there&#39;s a broader argument, but after a couple of weeks. Which is basically what I&#39;m doing here, heaven help me.<br><br><u>Abandoning Discussion</u><br><br>Please. Don&#39;t. Do. This. &gt;:(<br><br><u>Bearing Grudges/Lack of Reform</u><br><br>These could have been lumped together as &#39;patterns of behaviour&#39; (yes, that old bugbear). That&#39;s a concept which has previously been used to justify attacks as &#39;I remember you doing this thing twice, years back, therefore I interpret everything you do in that light&#39;, but it can also be a real problem: people who do something, apologise, and then do it again six months later.<br><br>I don&#39;t feel that it&#39;s reasonable to require an apology to be accepted before it counts. If the apology is recognised as sincere by the PPC community, then a grieved party who refuses to accept it (either by specifically rejecting it or by not replying) is being unreasonable; actions they take stemming from that refusal might be attacks under the Constitution.<br><br>I do think that throwing in a quick reminder (after an apology) that under the Constitution, doing the same thing again might lead to a ban, would be a good idea - it makes it clear that we&#39;re not just saying &#39;you apologised so we&#39;ll forget all about it&#39;. This can be done by anyone - it doesn&#39;t need to be Official Language, just a note to say &#39;we remember this happened, make sure you change&#39;.<br><br>And, uh, then we need to remember it happened, and hold them to that apology. If they keep doing the same thing over and over, or if they start acting in a way that suggests they don&#39;t feel bad over what happened, we should revisit the problem.<br><br>(Am I done? I mean, haha no, but I think I&#39;m done for this hour or so.)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>This is quite possibly the oldest PPC game, so if this is your first experience of it, it&#39;s got a long history. The rules are simple:<br><br>-I post a set of bad, plothole-ridden, and just plain weird summaries taken from Fanfiction.net.<br>-<u>Without</u> reference to the original story, you pick a summary and write a short fic which meets the description, makes a coherent story out of it, and is also highly amusing.<br>-Multiple people can respond to the same summary, so there&#39;s no need to claim. (Nor is Permission needed - while it&#39;s certainly possible to have PPC agents in FtP fics, it&#39;s not common.)<br>-Have fun! This is a game, it&#39;s about fun.<br><br>I&#39;ve taken these summaries from the top 5 categories each in Movies and Books over on FFN, to get a nice range. I&#39;ve also added ((little notes)) after each one, because I… like the sound of my own typing? I&#39;unno.<br><br><u>Oh, take me back to the start</u> (Harry Potter): Ginny tried to protect Harry from his own mind. It played tricks on Harry the same as Tom still played tricks on Ginny.<br>((Starting you off easy...))<br><br><u>Runaway Twin</u> (Twilight): Bella and Edward don&#39;t expect to have a baby, but Bella is surprised when she finds out she has twins. After both twins are born, one twin runs away, and they don&#39;t know what to do. They look for Renelle, but she is nowhere to be found. When she bumps into the Cullens one day, her life changes.<br>((You could&#39;ve had one where the Cullens watch Harry Potter, but I thought that was a bit too meta.))<br><br><u>Song of the Sea</u> (Percy Jackson): (Percabeth AU) Long ago, when pirates ruled the sea. There was a great and violent rivalry between the Pirate King and Warrior Queen, but what is better to end hate than love.<br>((Pirate King. Warrior Queen. Don&#39;t say I never give you anything.))<br><br><u>Asking About the Sunset</u> (Lord of the Rings): 3 days after they leave Rivendale, the Fellowship is setting up camp for the night, but they won&#39;t rest in peace. Pippin is bothering everyone with a question that is very ridicules! Will Pippin ever get his answer? Please read and review!<br>((I passed over one about an elf &#39;with the heart of a dwarf&#39; for this one, so make it good!))<br><br><u>150th Hunger Games A part of ourselves</u> (Hunger Games): This Hunger Games will be crueler than any other. Just when they thought the Capitol couldn&#39;t get worse it did just that. SYOC open. Form on my profile,<br>((Apparently &#39;future Hunger Games&#39; is far and away the most common story in the fandom.))<br><br><u>Family Reunited</u> (Star Wars): What happened between to Obi-Wan and Athena during Order 66 and can they reunite with all their loved ones.[One-Shot in between Kidnapped and Rescued]<br>((OMF(orce) Percy Jackson crossover?!?!))<br><br><u>A Little Unsteady</u> (Avengers): It&#39;s been three days since Loki joined the Avengers Initiative, two months after the battle of New York City. Loki&#39;s body decides to kick off the celebrations by fainting...multiple times. How will the other Avengers react to this new development? And will Loki feasibly be able to join the team if his problem continues? Reviews are candy!<br>((Reviews are candy! Yeah, I passed over a Harry Potter crossover for this.))<br><br><u>Ocean&#39;s Eyes</u> (Pirates of the Caribbean): Cassandra Holbrook doesn&#39;t belong in 18th century Port Royal. But she&#39;ll do her damn best to fit in, saving her adopted sister from pirates with the help of a pirate and blacksmith, all while pissing of her crush included.<br>((I have no idea what I&#39;ve just read. But at least the dreaded character &#39;JACKXOC&#39; doesn&#39;t make an appearance.))<br><br><u>The Omnikinetic</u> (X-Men: The Movie): What happens when Artemis, the virgin goddess, has a child- the grandchild of the Wolverine? Eliza Howlett, half mutant and half god, was born for one reason: to bring humanity and mutants together. She&#39;s entrusted to her father, Chase, who is to raise her and protect her; but when her mother returns briefly and Chase dies after a series of mishaps, Eliza must set off on her own.<br>((OMM(utants) PERCY JACKSON CROSSOVER?!?!?!?!))<br><br><u>The Return?</u> (High School Musical): I know I know, it&#39;s a note xD. BUT I&#39;M TELLING YOU RIGHT NOW. If you do not read this and you read my stories, you will A. Probably not have a story you like updated B. Miss out on some pretty chill stuff C. Miss important information<br>((I know nothing about High School Musical, so here&#39;s a summary that doesn&#39;t either. ^_^))<br><br>Have fun!<br><br>hS</p>

He&#39;d leaned against the wall and crossed his arms, staring hard at Obi-Wan&#39;s Force ghost. &quot;What <i>did</i> happen? Because she&#39;s really being very persistent--&quot;<br><br>&quot;Nothing happened,&quot; Obi-Wan insisted again. &quot;She misread the situation, that&#39;s all.

You seem...different.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I have regained my strength,&quot; she said. Her grey eyes were bright with intelligence. &quot;Finding myself in your world was--disquieting. But by remaining I managed to fulfill my quest.

His arms were crossed, and his expression fell just short of murderous.<br><br>&quot;Not your fault?&quot; Tony Stark gave him a Look. &quot;What, so you aren&#39;t the one who separated yourself from your body? You aren&#39;t the one who put it on autopilot? You aren&#39;t the one who&#39;s been letting it fall over at the worst possible times? Face it, this is exactly your idea of a joke.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Tony.&quot; Steve Rogers sighed heavily, setting down the polishing cloth he&#39;d been running over the surface of his shield. &quot;Loki&#39;s jokes may frequently be in poor taste, but he is an Avenger now, and we have to believe that--&quot;<br><br>&quot;He&#39;s been an Avenger for three days, Cap--&quot;<br><br>&quot;And he&#39;s been doing well in those days, apart from this fainting thing--&quot;<br><br>&quot;He has done it again,&quot; Thor announced. He walked into the room carrying a limp, dark-haired figure in full armor and green cape. &quot;Oh, hello, brother,&quot; he added with a nod to the see-through Loki. &quot;How do you fare?&quot;<br><br>Loki rolled his eyes. &quot;As well as I might, having fallen victim to my own curiosity. At least I am currently incapable of developing headaches.&quot;<br><br>&quot;What, so you&#39;re getting your jollies by trying to give <i>us</i> headaches?&quot; Tony grumbled. &quot;Nice try. Next time we go out, <i>you</i> can be the one to deal with everyone who wants to know if our newest Avenger is deathly ill or something. I&#39;ll make sure the tabloids get to you, too, don&#39;t think I won&#39;t.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I will be able to reverse it,&quot; Loki said loudly. &quot;I simply require more time.&quot; He turned pointedly away from the billionaire. &quot;Thor, have the materials arrived yet?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I do not see why I cannot simply hit it with my hammer,&quot; the Asgardian rumbled, but shook his head. &quot;They have not, Loki. I am told they will arrive within the day.&quot;<br><br>&quot;There,&quot; said Loki. He spoke now to Steve, still ignoring Tony. &quot;Tomorrow I will be able to finalize the device that will reverse this...mess. I will be able to return to my body.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Will your body stop fainting once you&#39;re in it?&quot; was the response.<br><br>Loki looked like he was contemplating whether or not rolling his eyes was a waste of time here. &quot;I see no reason for it to continue.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Good,&quot; Tony said briskly. He put down his empty coffee mug and got to his feet. &quot;Device gets built, Loki stops fainting and ghosting around, and we all get fewer headaches. I&#39;m on board. And busy. See you tomorrow.&quot; He headed for the elevator.<br><br>Thor lay Loki&#39;s body on a couch and smoothed its hair. &quot;All will be well, brother.&quot;<br><br>&quot;If the device is built well,&quot; Loki put in. &quot;There must be steady hands to assemble it.&quot;<br><br>&quot;You&#39;ll get them.&quot; Steve stood, stuffing the polishing cloth into his pocket and settling the shield on his arm. &quot;Tomorrow. Do you need anything before I go out?&quot;<br><br>Loki spread his ghostly hands. &quot;I am incorporeal, Captain. I have no need of anything.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Okay,&quot; Steve said. He hesitated and then set off for the elevator with an awkward nod. &quot;Good.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Good,&quot; Loki mouthed behind him, his expression mocking. This, at last, was enough to earn the eye-roll. He joined Thor by the couch, staring down at his body.<br><br>&quot;All will be well,&quot; Thor said again. He looked up at the ghostly Loki. &quot;You will be able to fix this, brother.&quot;<br><br>&quot;With borrowed hands,&quot; Loki sneered, but then he sighed. &quot;They must be steady. I weary of this.&quot;<br><br>&quot;They will be,&quot; Thor promised. He made as if to clasp Loki&#39;s shoulder, and then thought better of it.<br><br><i>Another advantage,</i> Loki thought to himself, but somehow the thought didn&#39;t bear the ire it once had.<br><br>-<br>(this Avengers one is very obviously an AU. Maybe it&#39;s following that idea I&#39;ve seen where Loki was somewhat mind-controlled himself during the Avengers movie, and has now come out of it and possibly been exiled to Midgard or something. Either way, being Loki and an Avenger, he&#39;s promptly got himself mixed up in some unfortunate magical situation. Blame the Enchantress, maybe!)</p>

            <p>Funnily enough, my friend and I were just talking about what <i>Arrow</i> would be like as a lighter show. Though now that I&#39;ve written that out, I&#39;m no longer sure what the connection (beyond &#39;DC&#39;) is to the AU...<br><br>Anyway. Let&#39;s see about more.<br><br>...oh, man, I can&#39;t believe I missed doing something with the &#39;reviews are candy&#39; line. Sequel&#39;s sounding better and better.<br><br>-<br><br>&quot;So he&#39;s, like, see-through now?&quot; Darcy Lewis asked. She was eating small pen-shaped candies from a little bag with a colorful label that read &#39;Reviews&#39;.<br><br>&quot;That&#39;s right.&quot; Jane Foster continued sorting through the papers on her desk without looking up.<br><br>&quot;But he&#39;s also walking around?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Uh-huh.&quot;<br><br>&quot;...Creepy,&quot; Darcy decided. &quot;Mega-creepy. I&#39;m glad you&#39;re building his thing; the sooner there&#39;s no more ghost-Loki wandering around, the better.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Thor will be happier,&quot; Jane mumbled. Seconds later, she pulled out a post-it note with a triumphant &quot;Aha!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Found the thing?&quot; Darcy popped several more Review candies into her mouth and began to chew.<br><br>&quot;Found the thing,&quot; Jane agreed. &quot;Let&#39;s go!&quot;<br><br>*<br><br>&quot;You&#39;re sure this&#39;ll work?&quot; Tony asked sceptically two days later. He eyed the completed device, which looked a little too much like an egg with too many wires looped through it. &quot;It&#39;s...small.&quot;<br><br>&quot;The thing Loki touched was also small,&quot; Natasha Romanoff pointed out. &quot;I&#39;m sure it packs quite the punch.&quot;<br><br>&quot;It does,&quot; Loki said. His body nodded, its eyes glassy. &quot;Come on, then,&quot; he said to it, stepping forward. &quot;We must both touch it at once.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Aye,&quot; said his body, and copied his movements. &quot;We shall soon be reuni...&quot;<br><br>The words trailed off as, for perhaps the tenth time in five days, Loki&#39;s body&#39;s eyes rolled up and it slumped to the floor.<br><br>The ghostly Loki, as well as several of the others, groaned aloud.<br><br>&quot;That was <i>not</i> good timing,&quot; came the inevitable complaint. Steve was the speaker, and he sounded worried. &quot;It&#39;s coincidental, right?&quot;<br><br>The Avengers and Company exchanged glances.<br><br>&quot;Do you have to be conscious for this to work?&quot; Tony asked the ghostly Loki.<br><br>&quot;If I do not wish to risk memory loss, then yes,&quot; was the tense reply. Loki knelt beside his body&#39;s head. &quot;Wake up,&quot; he commanded. &quot;Thor--shake him.&quot;<br><br>The blond Asgardian shook his head. &quot;That has not worked the past nine times,&quot; he said. &quot;I fear your return must be delayed, Loki.&quot;<br><br>Ghostly Loki got up, teeth bared in a snarl. &quot;This cannot be coincidence.&quot;<br><br>Natasha&#39;s eyes narrowed. &quot;You think someone else is controlling your body?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I do not know.&quot; Loki&#39;s voice was grim. &quot;But I intend to find out.&quot;</p>

Beneath Harry&#39;s argument with... she refused to consider what it could be that would twist her husband&#39;s voice into that hissing parody that summoned back her darkest nightmares... she could hear the soft burbling of her son. He was in there, with... <i>that</i>... and <i>that</i> seemed to be winning the fight.<br><br>Ginny drew a slow, deep breath, braced herself, and then shoved through the door, a <i>Petrificus Totalus</i> on the tip of her tongue. If Harry had been taken over, she had no time for half measures-!<br><br>She stumbled to a halt, staring down in bewilderment. Harry Potter knelt on the floor next to their clearly-enthralled baby, wrestling with his own hand. &quot;No!&quot; he exclaimed. &quot;You&#39;re not allowed to tickle him!&quot; Then, making the most ridiculous face, he hissed, &quot;I am the greatessst tickler, precious, you can never sssstop me!&quot;<br><br>James made a bubbling noise, reaching out one chubby hand towards his father&#39;s wriggling fingers. Harry chuckled, patted his cheek, then looked up at Ginny.<br><br>&quot;Sorry, love,&quot; he said, smiling clean up to his eyes, &quot;he was fussing, so I brought him in here... did we wake you?&quot;<br><br><hr>
<br><br>Because there&#39;s nowt better than turning angst into fluff. Hey, it said she <i>tried</i> to...<br><br>hS</p>
