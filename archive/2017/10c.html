            <p>Hello! For the past few years, I&#39;ve found strange enjoyment in  bad fanfiction. To be specific, I quite like listening to it on YouTube. About four or five days ago, I was googling &quot;Forbiden Fruit&quot; again for God knows what reason and discovered the PPC wiki. The idea of going into a fic and killing the Sues inside is something that I&#39;ve loved and the fact that the PPC exists is one of the most amazing things I have found. Since then, I have read a potentially alarming amount of the wiki, missions, and I&#39;m currently making my way through the Original Series.<br>Harry Potter was part of my childhood, but Eragon was what got me really into the fantasy genre. Due to the parts of the internet that I tend to visit, I didn&#39;t learn that the Inheritance series is awful until very recently and I have since read the sporkings to try and disillusion myself. My childhood is founded on lies.<br>I started roleplaying before I knew what I was doing and as a result, the Mary-est of Sues was born. If I ever decide to try work up the guts to write for the PPC, my first order of business is to make my character go back in time and spork herself.<br><br>Fandoms of choice include Harry Potter, World of Warcraft (current roleplay medium), the Zamonia books by Walter Moers, Pretty Cure, and most of Inheritance.<br><br>Please don&#39;t hit me.</p>

Pay no attention to the voices. Anyways, nice to see you. Take a Bolter and a flask of Fenrisian Ale (I&#39;d be careful drinking that stuff if I were you), and gather round the fire.

            <p>Haha! Interesting that you do most on YouTube - guys, this might be a sign that The PPC Channel might be a good prospect to look into after all! (I have a better idea of how it would work now - if anyone wants the explanation, I can give it to them.)<br><br>Anyway, hi, I&#39;m Twistey, and I&#39;m not going to judge you at all for liking the Inheritance series! I actually read Eragon and was okay with it, but well, usually I don&#39;t read books I don&#39;t like and I almost always like any book I read. (Guys, put the knives down! Put the knives down!) My biggest fandom (outside of my own written worlds) would have to be Wolfenstein 3D or anything else made in the 90s by iD Software. I&#39;m a lightly-used-bie, as I usually say, with a few agents-to-be.<br><br>About that Mary Sue you made, can you describe her for me? I&#39;m kind of interested to hear about her. Maybe we can compare childhood Sues, that would be fun.<br><br>Ah, yes! I almost forgot your newbie gift! Let&#39;s see. *rummages through a bag*. Aha! Since Halloween is coming up, I&#39;m going to give you a truckload of fabric and other stuff to make costumes with, as well as a bottomless face paint palette and a shapeshifting wig! I can use a sewing machine, so if you need me to sew something together for whatever costume you end up creating, just ask me! ;)<br><br>Nice to meet you, and welcome! I wish you a wonderful career as a PPCer!<br><br>-Twistey</p>

            <p>If I get too specific in describing my old Sue, I&#39;ll probably unearth a truckload of memories that I&#39;ve been trying to block out of my brain for the past five years. So, let&#39;s see...<br><br>She was a night elf death knight, part dragon, part nightsaber, knew draconic, and she wore a lot of awful outfits. There was a point where she was able to get a drop of blood from the dragon queen. She also godmoded a lot, but that I partially blame on my 12-year-old self for not knowing how to RP. I didn&#39;t have anyone to tell me what to do, so a lot of my RP learning was just figuring it out by trial and error as I went.<br><br>Actually, she originated from an even older fanfiction trilogy that I wrote, so old in fact that it&#39;s written on actual paper! Each story took up one spiral notebook and had illustrations. They are hidden at the back of my closet because if I see them, I will scream.<br>This character prototype was a draenei death knight who united the Alliance and Horde against the Lich King, killed said Lich King, and was redeemed into a half-ish paladin. <br>In the second story, it takes place some time after the first where the main characters are all half-bred teenagers who mastered the elements and came from Feralas: the blood elf/night elf fire hunter who trained a dragon, the tauren/draenei water shaman who died at the end of the third story, the troll/something wind rogue who I didn&#39;t care about, the human/blood elf earth paladin who was the love interest of the hunter, and a god-freaking cat girl from Sholazar Basin. I don&#39;t remember what happened in the third story, just that it ended in Wintergrasp and Sylvanas fell off a cliff or something.<br><br>I need to go... lie down... on the floor...</p>

            <p>Man, that&#39;s pretty Sueish. The ones from my fanfics don&#39;t seem so bad now... If you can get through the cringe enough, I&#39;d love to see the illustrations. Huh, maybe I can help you learn to cope with the cringe. I currently can cope with every bad thing I&#39;ve written (except for this one robot that I don&#39;t like to talk about.)<br><br>Of course, mine weren&#39;t that over the top but were still Sues nonetheless, because everything came so easy to them. They never had any real conflicts or consequences. It was stupid. I&#39;m trying to think of any specific examples that were obvious Sues, but I can&#39;t really. Oh jeez. <br><br>...Wait, it seems that my Sues actually became more Sueish over time up until the point where I started actually trying to improve my writing. I had the idea for a story once about a friend and I getting stuck in a fandom and taken in by main characters. I still have a few guilty pleasures and personal tropes I indulge in in my current works that could be Sueish if taken too far, or at least very bad writing. (For one thing, I love being the center of attention, and lots of my stories are inspired by my own personal experiences, so in most of my stories, either the #1 protagonist or a prominent antagonist starts off being based on me. Not only does it open up a potential for wish fulfillment when I think of my creation as myself, but it&#39;s also generally very annoying to see a character based on the author play a major part in a story that isn&#39;t literally about the author and isn&#39;t a fanfiction with the author&#39;s &#39;sona. Especially if the author <i>proudly</i> calls the character not just an insert but an <i>avatar</i>, which is another way of saying &quot;ATTENTION EVERYONE! THIS WHOLE STORY IS A WISH FULFILLMENT AND I SE NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT!&quot;. I usually solve this issue by making the former insert much different from me in appearance and personality. I also tend to create another character that is meant to be literally me, and have her sort of hang around in the background or be an Easter egg. There are a few exceptions to this rule, although over time I might become sick of them and turn the inserts into regular non-insert characters. But anyway, enough of that rambling.) Every time I think about a piece of writing I&#39;m working on, I think to myself: <i>Do I need to remove my personal tropes from this work, or would it be okay to leave them in in this situation? If I need to take them out, how can I do it?</i> That&#39;s helped me a lot with improving my stories, and as a result, I do believe I&#39;ve stopped writing Sues... at least, they aren&#39;t Sues in the final drafts.<br><br>I proofread and revised that last paragraph like 25 times, wow.<br><br>-Twistey</p>

            <p>The PPC Halloween party was just beginning to get underway. Agents mingled here and there, some sitting at tables and chatting over food, others milling around the room, dancing and admiring each other's costumes. A long table full of sweets and snacks was set up along the back wall of the ballroom, and in the corner was a tub of apples floating in cold water. A cloud of live bats fluttered about the ceiling, <i>à la</i> Hogwarts, and spooky music oozed softly from speakers disguised as Jack-o'-lanterns set around the room.</p>

            <p>"Thriller, thriller night! So let me hold you tight and share a killer, thriller, yow~!" Miguel sang along, doing his best to moonwalk. "I'm gonna thrill you tonight~"</p>

<p>Violet, wearing Wonder Woman's iconic leotard-boots-bracelets-tiara ensemble and a black wig, stopped doing the memetic zombie dance and cleared her throat. "<i>Darkness falls across the land, the midnight hour is close at hand. Creatures crawl in search of blood to terrorize your neighborhood...</i>"</p>

<p>"It's 'y'all's neighborhood,' get it right." Miguel gave her an annoyed look.</p>

<p>"<i>And whosoever shall be found without the soul for getting down/Must stand and face the hounds of hell and rot inside a corpse shell,</i>" she continued. "Yeesh, I feel like I'm summoning Hades. No wonder he got Vincent Price to do this part."</p>

<p>"This is one of many reasons why I love Halloween," said Miguel with a grin. "When else do you get to see Wonder Woman doing the Thriller dance?"</p>

<p>"I would assume the outtakes of her latest film, Mr. Bond." Violet returned his grin. "Oooh, here comes the cool part of the monologue! <i>And though you fight to stay alive, your body starts to shiver...</i>" </p>

<p>"For no mere mortal can resist..." </p>

<p>"<i>The evil...of the Thriller!</i>" they intoned. They then high-fived as Vincent Price's evil laugh echoed from the speakers.</p>

<p>Anne, dressed in khakis, sandals, and pith helmet, blinked.  "I'm pretty sure I agree . . . You said grown-ups suck at parties, right?"</p>

<p>Harry nodded and glowered, which accented the angry expression of his evil clown makeup in a frightening way.  "A vecher ought to be all gromky and grahzny.  Not just like jabberjaw and paper dooks.  Back in the old globe, I would see gullivers getting cracked in and cables all a-razrez."  He savagely mimed a cutting motion.</p>

<p>Anne looked away, wide-eyed.  "Then again, grown-up parties do have some charms."</p>

<p>"Humph!  Hardly. Halloween is defined by the Kids Next Door as a kids-only holiday. "  Numbuh 3721 crossed her arms.  She wore the traditional battle helmet of the KND, composed of kitchenware.  "This overt takeover by adults is nothing more than a flagrant attempt on our candy intake, thinly disguised as an excuse to have boring chatter with each other."</p>

<p>The three kids stood for an awkward moment.</p>

<p>"Of course," said Anne, "we're just standing here talking, too."</p>

<p>They stood for another, much more awkward, moment.</p>

<p>"True enough," admitted Harry.</p>

<p>Numbuh 3721 pointed dramatically at the long table of sweets.  "Kids Next Door: candy station!"</p>

<p>"I love your costumes," said a mid-sized brown horse. "Someday I'd like to try making one of my own, but when you have illusion magic you don't really need to. Tell me--" she turned to the girl in khakis "--are you dressed as anyone in particular or just a generic explorer?"</p>

<p>Harry and Numbuh 3721 glared at Gandalf!Peregrin.  The girl said, "No, you certainly <i>aren't</i> us.

            <p>"It is possible that I might never understand." he continued, voice returning to its usual tone. "Maybe the old saying is true and the progress of holidays, like that of the sciences, is measured in funerals. We ancient ones do become productively set in our thoughts.". Peregrin gave a bit of a chuckle at that for some reason that was not readily apparent.</p>

<p>"Then again, I know rather little of this holiday. My home did not have it." he said. "So thereby I bid you teach, that I might become taught."</p>

<p>Harry shrugged.  "Long as it involves like side-eight sladkies, I'm for it."</p>

<p>Anne smiled at Ami.  "Very nice costume idea!  I'm Anne."  She turned an airy, emotionless expression on Chris.  "Well, we're <i>from</i> the Nursery.  Originally, I come from <i>Goosebumps</i>.  Numbuh 3721 is former Kids Next Door, and she's wearing her old battle suit.  Harry's from <i>A Clockwork Orange</i>, but he didn't dress from his home world.  Some of us just snuck in to that new R-rated <i>It</i> movie.  Harry liked it quite a bit."</p>

            <p>"Halloween began in the days of the second alliance between children and adults.  It seemed a successful partnership at first, with chore duties shared, and children once again had access to Earth's many environments they hadn't been able to enjoy during their exile on the moon.</p>

<p>"The peace, of course, couldn't last.  When adults built the brainwashing institutions called 'schools,' children began to rebel against the tedium of the school day and the time wasted on homework.  On cool, dark nights in autumn, small groups of children would put on disguises and cause mischief for adults.  Most kids didn't want to terrorize the parents assigned to their family units they had come to know and love, but would sneak around to the houses of neighboring adults.</p>

<p>"At first, the children only wore frightening disguises, terrorizing the adults into giving them food and other treats to make the kids go away.  Soon, though, the adults learned what was happening, and were no longer frightened.  Then, the kids changed tactics, using one to ring the front doorbell and distract the adults through talking while the rest of the group infiltrated the home and took what they want.  Eventually, the adults learned it was easier to keep a bowl of candy near the door, always ready to bribe any children at the door to go away so they could stay inside and guard from intrusion—they had come recognize that their choice was a treat, or be tricked.</p>

<p>"After many decades, "trick-or-treating" had become a tradition among kid culture, with a special day set aside for its observance.  Adults eventually forgot its true origins, and began to celebrate it in their own, curious way, with terribly uninteresting parties without enough candy.  But we children still remember the truth behind the so-called 'holiday:' a period of rebellion and empowerment against the rigid structuralism that adults impose upon us all year long."</p>

<p>Harry stared at her with an open mouth for a moment.  Then, he turned to Peregrin and said, "Really, it's just an excuse to knock things over and crast stuff with your droogs."</p>

<p>((Actually, as far as I can tell through memory and research, the Kids Next Door don't seem to attach much importance to Halloween.  Call this a fringe theory, call 3721 an AU character, whatever works.))</p>

<p>"So, hmmm, wildly diverging accounts" Peregrin said to himself, pointing at various locations in empty space as he thought "common elements. Naming collisions? Well, possibly, but we cannot simply ... So where, where, how would, cultural segmentation? .. No, one of the accounts carries distinct histories. So, inheritance by filtering? That could be it. Yes. Yes."</p>

<p>He looked at the two kids he'd been talking to again. "Were your home universes partly defined in the same place, say, World One?" he asked. "No wait, that is rather technical wording. Is there, ah, a universe I could go to where I could find stories about both the canons you came from? And is Halloween a holiday there?"</p>

<p>As answer to Peregrin, Numbuh 3721 said, "We know how the worlds work, thank you very much.  World One contains both a tv series made from my world, and a novel made from Harry's.  And it has Halloween, though the resident children of World One have had its true history wiped from their minds in school.

<p>He pulled out a small notebook and opened it up to a page near the back, which was almost entirely black from the various notes that had been written there. "Halloween - World One sources?" he wrote somewhat diagonally (but surprisingly neatly, for diagonal text) near the margin.</p>

<p>"We were, after all, doing, ... uh, doing, going ... why are we here, anyhow? It had something to do with candy, I think." he said, having gotten a bit sidetracked by the whole discussion.</p>

<p>"Jeeze, you're such a jerk," Anne muttered to him.  "Harry speaks some weird Russian English thing from his home world.  We mostly get what he means from context and tone, but half of what he says isn't worth hearing anyway.  Don't think about it too much, and don't be insulted.  It's just a teen rebellion thing."  Quietly, she added, "Even though he's only 
nine."</p>

<p>Harry flipped her off with one hand.</p>

<p>"yes, I'm so impressed with how adult and mature you are."</p>

<p>Harry flipped her off with both hands.</p>

<p>Numbuh 3721, meanwhile, nodded to Peregrin.  "Indeed, we were making for the candy table.  A heavy dose of candy consumption at one sitting will be the first step in your Halloween education."</p>

<p>"Remind me, again, how I allowed myself to be convinced to do this," said Thoth. His helmet was off, as usual, revealing a pale face and, surprisingly, a long beard. "It will take an eternity to strip this coat of paint from my armor, and growing this beard was... an unwise decision."</p>

<p>Tom grinned, taking a swig of Coke. "You're the one who can read minds. I just thought it would be <em>funny</em>. Which it is. Maybe you have more of a sense of humor than you say you do."</p>

<p>Thoth's face darkened. "Had you been there, you would perhaps not think it so funny. However, I allowed myself to be convinced: Perhaps you have a point. I shall reflect upon it after the end of this... ceremony."</p>

<p>Tom frowned, adjusting his costume - red robes, the Mechanicum symbol, and a frankly excessive number of prosthetics. "Thoth, I am sorry for your loss. If it helps... don't think of this as a ceremony. Think of it as an opportunity to mock your greatest enemies and longstanding rivals.'</p>

<p>The edges of Thoth's lips twitched upwards, forming the beginnings of a smile. "Once again, you make a good point." He adjusted the fur cloak hung over his armour, making visible the wolf icon inscribed on his pauldron, which was now grey-blue and yellow in contrast with its usual bright blue and gold. "Drinking contest, anyone?"</p>

She gave her signature wry half-smile, then grew solemn, and laid her hands on Thoth's bare temples in an attitude of benediction. "You were made for war, and have known more than anyone's fair share of horror and grief. I have neither the power nor the right to correct the imbalance at the source, but if I could, I would. There <i>are</i> benevolent forces in the multiverse; there is hope; there are second chances.

I reckon Elms is the most likely to secretly enjoy <i>Twilight</i>, and is also a down-to-earth sort who might be good for offsetting its nonsense. But FicPsych is so small that I believe everyone has at least heard of just about everyone. Apparently not since Charlotte got partnered with Ix, though. ))</p>

<p>Thoth nodded. "A Sue who dares to think itself an Astartes deserves no less than a painful death. Possibly prolonged." He took a long swig of mjød.</p>

            <p>Derik's lip curled. "Or a singer. Or, scorch us, all bloody three." He took a deep drink from his cup and was once more disappointed that it was only water.</p>

<p>Gall wished she had a drink at all, but, though she'd never admit it, her stomach still wasn't quite right after her one taste of mjød. So she settled for teasing Thoth some more. "Just to be clear, Jötun: are you drinking to forget my charms again—cuz don't think I didn't notice that the first time—or is it that you've got a sordid tale of Sueage for us?"</p>

<p><i>Concurrently...</i></p>

<p>Jenni added her voice to Ix's: "No, no, no, please don't set him off again." She continued, "It wasn't even anything he said, really. At least, I don't think so." She tilted her head at Ix. "Was it?"</p>

<p>Charlotte put her hands on her shoulders. "Ix. Hon. Breathe."</p>

<p>"You want me to go over there and clarify with wossisface that he's not mad at you?" Charlotte asked. "Because I can totally do that."</p>

            <p>Derik just scowled at Charlotte and turned himself around again, holding his swollen right hand to his chest.</p>

<p>Jenni couldn't take it anymore and knelt by his left side, one hand on his shoulder. "Would you please let me do something with that?" she murmured, <i>sotto voce</i>. "Or Ix? Or him, even?" She pointed her eyes at Thoth. She didn't trust the idea of 40K warp-sorcery at all—and that was the way she imagined the Astartes had meant to help—but she'd force down her own raised hackles if it got the job done.</p>

<p>Derik would have preferred to be left alone entirely at the moment, and only felt more humiliated by the nurse's concern for his idiotic self-injury. Shockingly, it turned out that punching a wall, even with a mirror on it, might not have been such a good idea after all, but he'd be dashed if he was going to admit it when he'd already been made to look a fool. He leaned away and growled something incoherent along the lines of "push off."</p>

<p>Willfully oblivious to this by-play, Gall turned back to Thoth. "So, before that hilarious interruption, I asked you a question. Got a story for us, or do you admit that I'm rocking your sad, repressed world?" She grinned at him, well aware of exactly how full of it she was.</p>

<p>While she gently rubbed a dollop into Derik's knuckles (numbing her own fingers in the process), she opened her mind and tentatively reached out to Thoth, just brushing the edge of his awareness. ~Testing, testing... is this thing on?~ She glanced up and gave him a wry half-smile. She was nervous, and a little embarrassed to be nervous, and she let him feel it. It wasn't personal, it was just a sort of bitter aftertaste, a dissonant semitone, that was woven into the fabric of his universe and set her on edge. It scared her, not so much because she felt threatened, but because she felt tempted to address it. What might a being like herself accomplish in sweetening what was bitter, in tuning the clashing chords, and bringing redemption and hope where there was only tragedy and despair?</p>

            <p>Merging a little more deeply into Thoth's consciousness, she could feel his concentration and concern, and liked him better for it.</p>

<p>~The body has everything it needs to heal itself, wanting only time and energy,~ she advised, ~but it tends to go overboard if left to its own devices. The trick is to restrain as much as to encourage... like a carefully pruned topiary. Though, that said, don't let's leave any bone matrix in the shape of dolphins or unicorns or whatever.~</p>

<p>It was a funny image, but she withdrew it and got serious, not wishing to undo Thoth's mental preparations. She laid a hand on his, just to reinforce that she was there, ready to help and guide if necessary. "Ready, Derik?" She put her other hand on his shoulder again, completing the circuit.</p>

<p>He was watching them, aware that things were happening beyond his ken. With his pain dulled by numbweed, curiosity surfaced and his resentment at being ganged up on receded. He nodded. "Yes."</p>

<p>Jenni nodded back. ~In your own time, then.~</p>

            <p>Thoth released the energy, keeping it tightly controlled as he pushed in into Derik, concentrating on the task at hand. He could not lose control, but to think as such was to do so. He kept his mind above such thoughts, focusing on what he was doing in that instant: bringing the bones together, sealing the cuts and scrapes, ensuring that his corrections did not cause additional damage.</p>

<p>He may have been, by the standards of the Pavoni, a poor biomancer. But he'd had 10,000 years to hone the craft channeling power from a more chaotic source. Well, more or less 10,000. Time was funny in the Eye. But he wasn't thinking about that, not now.</p>

            <p>The sensation wasn't painful, exactly; more of a deep itch as his tissue and bone knit itself back together at rapid speed. He watched in fascination.</p>

<p>Jenni did chip in a little, helping to sweep the excess lymph and the debris of broken cells away from the fracture site, to be disposed of  properly by the appropriate organs. Mere janitorial work, really, but it gave her satisfaction to be an active part of the effort. It was <i>good</i> to do what she was meant for, and she was pleased with the painstaking job Thoth was doing, too. She shared her love with the others—all of them, for a brief moment, before she reined in her aura again.</p>

<p>"... Is it done?" Derik asked.</p>

            <p>"It is, in fact, done." He turned to Jenni. "Do try to keep a tighter grip on your aura in the future should we work together again. I am sensitive to such things, and the additional distraction makes it harder to keep my mind focused. I can, of course, do it, but there is no need to make the task more difficult. And I do not like to think of what may happen if my focus were to slip. Other than that..." He gave a short bow. "It was a pleasure to work with you. You are clearly quite skilled."</p>

            <p>Jenni withdrew completely, like a luminous green and blue anemone retreating into its dark column. She wouldn't have let anything bad happen, but he was right; she had no excuse to be projecting all over the place like a neonate. Cut off and alone in her mind again, she felt diminished, but at his ending words she raised her eyes, and their liveliness had returned.</p>

<p>"You're not so bad yourself," she said, smiling. "I'd say 'any time', but I'm under some pretty tight restrictions here. This was probably a once-off thing." She sighed and turned to Derik. "How's it feel?"</p>

<p>He'd been flexing his hand, testing it out, and he nodded. "Still numb, of course, but moving well. Strong. Thank you, friends. I am unworthy of you." At Charlotte's remark, he added, "The next time I do something that stupid, I'll come to Ix first, and spare everyone else a repeat performance." Even he wasn't sure how much he meant it.</p>

<p>"Because Ix is super into the really dorky stuff but she, like, never gets out of the RC—but if you got her into a game...?" Charlotte trailed off, raising her eyebrows meaningfully.</p>

<p><i>Meanwhile...</i></p>

<p>Derik managed to weave his way out of the crowd with a minimum of awkward collisions. After relieving himself, he felt a bit better; a full bladder could wreck even a sane and sober man's mental coherence. He washed up, splashed his face, and stood staring at the mirror above the sink. The symbol of the Green Lanterns stood out on his chest.</p>

<p>"Willpower," he muttered. "You're a disgrace to that uniform."</p>

<p>Leaning against the wall outside, Jenni started at a crunch of glass and a muffled yelp. She spun around, quite prepared to barge in, but the door opened before she could get her hand on it and she almost ran into Derik coming out. Startled in turn, he reared back, flailing, and they grabbed onto each other's arms.</p>

<p>"What are you doing?" he demanded, scowling. He'd restored the green domino mask over his eyes.</p>

<p>"What are <i>you</i> doing?" she retorted. She turned over his right hand, took in the freshly reddened knuckles, and looked up in expectant concern.</p>

<p>"Restoring a measure of clarity," he answered. "Don't look so panicked, it's not a habit. But it is effective."</p>

<p>A thousand protests were on her tongue, but she swallowed them. "All right. Now what?"</p>

<p>"Now I go back and apologize like a man, tell the story I promised, and go home before anything else <i>ironic</i> happens. Coming?"</p>

<p>Jenni sighed. "You bet."</p>

<p>Jenni shook her head. She wasn't sure if he was quoting House on purpose or not, but it didn't matter. She contented herself with fending him off from running into anyone on the way back and detouring to the drinks table for a big cup of water. "Here. I heard your voice cracking."</p>

<p>Derik glanced down at the cup and gave her a skeptical look. "You'd have a harper wet his throat with plain water? The Master would be appalled."</p>

            <p>Barring all the other excellent reasons he was no good for anyone, he was surely too old for Ix, and he suddenly regretted his choice of a skin-tight costume that might tend to attract attention to his physique. He glanced at Gall, who tended to have one of two reactions to other girls noticing him: jovial agreement or bitter enmity, with scant middle ground.</p>

<p>In this instance, her eyes had narrowed at Ix, but once she mentioned her girlfriend, the Viking relaxed again. She left Ix and Tom to it and turned to her partner. "So are you gonna finish the story, or what?"</p>

            <p>And suddenly all eyes were on him again. "Right." He took a preparatory drink of water. It was good, and he did need it; he'd have to remember to say something nice to Jenni later. But now, he had said he would do this, and whatever else he was, he was a man who upheld his commitments. "Where was I...?"</p>

<p>"Awake in FicPsych, about to give me conniptions," Jenni said with a half-smile.</p>

<p>"Right," he said again. "Erik, the original Erik, had just left me with his injunction to live ringing in my ears. I wasn't thinking clearly, but I got up and found my few belongings—my boots, my belt, my flight jacket—and I started walking. If you've lived in Headquarters for any amount of time, you know it's nearly impossible to get where you're going if you think about it, but it's equally impossible to get anywhere if you're as empty of purpose and drive as I was. I went on in that fugue state for some time, I don't know how long. At times I slept, and then I would get up and go on again. I saw no one, or if I did, I don't recall... but I felt as though someone, or something, was watching me, guiding my steps.</p>

<p>"I had gone by many doors, all the same, and taken no heed of them, but finally I came to one I could not pass by. This portal that loomed up before me was different from the others. It was large, and I could feel the heaviness of its metal. Something ominous was on the other side, but I wasn't afraid—I was still numb. With no thought of any direction but forward in my mind, I turned its great wheel and stepped inside.</p>

<p>"The door slammed shut behind me, and I was in total darkness. Robbed of vision, I stopped.</p>

<p>"But something could see me. This presence was not sapient, I think, but it had logic and a purpose with me. Everything I was, had been, and might have been was laid bare to it, as though I were as insubstantial as the spoken word. First it looked at me and through me, and then it began to change me."</p>

<p>He had to pause for another sip of water.</p>

<p>"The first thing I knew differently was knowing. Whereas before all I could hold in my mind was my half-life with Alanna in our narrow, ill-begotten mockery of Pern, now I knew my world as it really is. And I knew my real place in it. Not as a Weyrleader, because the leadership of all the Weyrs is well known, but yet a bronzerider, one who chose a life in the untamed Southern Continent during the Ninth Pass. Before that, a harper, and a headstrong, reckless young man."</p>

<p>He shook his head ruefully. "I said I would tell you how I lost my eye twice in one day, and now we come to the point. You've seen my face." He took off the green domino mask so they could get another look. The right side was covered in a sunken, sinusoidal pattern of scars. They extended down the side of his neck, down into his unitard. They'd cut through part of his right eyebrow and left his hairline ragged. They had caused muscle damage and distortion that left the right side of his mouth permanently stretched to the side and unable to properly pull up in a smile. And they had taken the sight from his right eye. "This is Threadscar. This is the hazard we face on Pern, and it is what dragonriders exist to combat. I remember when I got this.</p>

<p>"It was our first Threadfall. No more were Skepnadth and I confined to the ground. At last, we were in the air, where we were meant to be! Our job was to carry firestone to the fighting wings—firestone is the substance that gives a dragon his flame. We had practiced our throw over and over, and we were good at it. We were strong, our power boundless, and our joy fierce. ... Every man thinks he's immortal at nineteen. A Fall lasts four hours, and I began to tire of the heavy goggles on my face. I was hot; sweat dripped into my eyes, and I could hardly see. So, fool that I was, I took them off. Just for a little while, I thought. We were such excellent flyers, what could possibly go wrong?</p>

<p>"A thick tangle of Thread. A gust of wind. Both of us screaming, the sound swallowed in cold <i>between</i> as Skepnadth jumped to safety. We were lucky to live."</p>

<p>He paused. The memory was strong, painful in many ways. But he'd indulged himself in grief quite sufficiently for one night.</p>

<p>"I remember when I got this," he said again, indicating his scars with a nod and a raised cup. "I was standing in the dark with a face belonging to another man. But something looked at me, and saw a dragonman, not a Phantom. It changed me. I felt the sting of something superficial sinking deep into my flesh... and when the door to the Reality Room opened again, I was half-blind, who had been twice blinded. ... And lucky to live."</p>

<p><br>
(( Disclaimer: Derik might be exaggerating about the Reality Room just a tad for poetic effect. But don't go in there if you're at all impossible. )) </p>

            <p>Ix looked down at the ground, twisting the stem of her rose until it began to split. "About your eye, and, and your friend. My, uh, my mum read the books to me. And... I don't think the words did it justice, describing what that felt like. I can't even imagine..."</p>

            <p>He had rather warmed to his performance as it went on, and this was not the reaction he'd hoped for. "What...? No, you've missed the point. That was the <i>good</i> part."</p>

<p>Jenni had to laugh, a small, contained chuckle. "Oh, Derik. What about the part after that, where you battled your way back to FicPsych, terrified poor Elms, and proceeded to muscle your way through a <i>heavy</i> dose of fellis juice in order to help us fight off the Mary Sue invasion?"</p>

<p>Derik was taken aback, but unsure how to respond. On the one hand, Gall was attached to her weapon and was likely to mope and carry on about this until she could get Agent Brightbeard to repair it, possibly even after, and he couldn't help feeling a little sympathy for her. On the other hand, she did so richly deserve to be checked, even thus harshly. He settled for a muted "Steady, there," which might have been addressed to anyone. He did find himself awkwardly patting Thoth's pauldron, for all the effect that would have.</p>

<p>It was Jenni who jumped into the middle, putting out her hands and turning 'round to create a space between Gall, Thoth, and Ix. "Easy, everyone!" She then spoke to Gall: "You were asking for trouble, so hush, and keep your pointies to yourself next time." Then Thoth: "And you, you could have just taken it away, and I reckon we'd all have cheered you on. I know your universe doesn't leave much room for temperance, but work on it more, eh?

            <p>"I'm sorry," she mumbled, backing away. "I'm just gonna... go."</p>

<p>Her foot hit the broken pieces of Gall's mace; she knelt and gingerly picked them up, repaired it with a quickly muttered spell, and held it out to Gall, still keeping her eyes on the floor.</p>

<p>Wait, crap. Was she getting blood on it? Maybe Gall wouldn't notice?</p>

<p>Derik was relieved, too, and felt happier taking his new friend's part. "It's all right, mate. The wretch had the lesson coming—and look, all's well."</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Gall took her mace tentatively from Ix, somewhat shocked at getting it back in one piece so suddenly. "Huh. Thanks, Bucktooth. You're all right." She slapped Ix bracingly on the shoulder and made to slide the mace back into its loop on her belt, and her hand encountered a stickiness on the haft. "Oi, what...?

<p>"So? No rule says the teams have to be fair. Blast Hardcheese got killed last season, and I don't want a repeat. Even the Physical Therapy nerds kicked our asses thanks to their precog and your totally divided loyalties."</p>

            <p>"Yes, it is!" Gall said.</p>

<p>"It's a game," Derik went on, ignoring her, "and there are rules. You play in a pitch-dark corridor and hit a light-up ball back and forth until one team can't continue. No magic or powers, no weapons but padded bats."</p>

<p>"And no protection unless you're a wuss."</p>

<p>"Unless it's for other players' protection. We don't actually want to seriously injure anyone."</p>

<p>Gall grinned. "Just to the point where they cry for mercy. If they're still conscious."</p>

<p>"But it isn't supposed to be a brawl, which you always 'forget'." He looked up at Thoth. "I'm not saying you wouldn't be an asset, but someone has to worry about safety! And that's for our own team, too. It all gets very mixed up in the dark. If I had your word it would be all right, perhaps...?"</p>

<p><i>Meanwhile...</i></p>

<p>Jenni blinked, not particularly thrilled at being balked twice in one evening, but shook it off with a subtle shift of posture. "Oh, that's good," she said. "Go on, then." She indicated that Ix should proceed with her healing. As long as it got done, she supposed.</p>

            <p>Derik swung around to glare at Tom. "Don't be <i>sorry</i>." He sneered the word. "Nobody be <i>sorry</i> for me."</p>

<p>"I'm not!" Gall chirped.</p>

<p>Jenni shot her an angry look, but this went ignored.</p>

<p>"<i>Thank</i> you," Derik said profoundly, flourishing an arm in imitation of a bow to his partner. "That's what I like about you. You're rude, and annoying, and selfish—but you're not sorry. And you brought me food. ... What <i>is</i> this?" He held up something that looked like a cocktail wiener, but its sauce had somehow been turned a noxious shade of green.</p>

<p>"Um, I think the sign said 'Alien Guts'? Gimme one." The two of them bent over the plate.</p>

<p>Jenni shook her head, gave a sniff to clear her sinuses, and took a step toward Tom and Thoth. She couldn't help but observe the Astartes' withdrawn silence, and the nurse knew trauma when she saw it. Her work was never done. "Hey, big fella." She gently rapped a knuckle against the back of his armored hand. "You want a turn in the sharing circle?"</p>

            <p>"Alright, then. I won't be sorry." He shrugged, and turned to Thoth. "Do you want to tell her?"</p>

<p>Thoth shrugged. "She will find out sooner or later if she really wants to, anyways." He turned to the nurse. "The fifteenth legion's story is not a happy one, and our doom was neither quick nor painless. We were accused of sorcery, the Wolves sent to our world to bring us back. As to whether the judgement were just... that is not for me to say."</p>

<p>"The orders were changed, telling the Wolves to destroy us. Our own primarch found the judgement just. He did not inform us of what was coming, lowered our defenses." He looked down again. "We tried to fight back. At first, it went well. But they had brought the Sisters of Silence with them. And as the battle wore one... more and more of my brothers succumbed to our defects."</p>

<p>"They called it the flesh-change. A menace accentuated by our psychic talents. Those who succumbed became... something I'd rather not think about. Death was preferable. And as our city burned and our brethren and citizens lay slaughtered in the streets... our primarch made a pact to save us. A pact that gave us our lives, and but cost us our pride and our freedom. We were taken to a new world, our powers amplified - and we had become servants of the Architect of Fate, choice or no."</p>

<p>Thoth looked down. "As the flesh-change grew worse... a group of us made an attempt to fix it. They failed, the ritual going horrifyingly awry. Most of our number were turned to dust, their souls fractured and trapped within their armor, becoming little more than mindless automatons, doomed to eternal torment." He looked back up, still seemingly distant. "I saw my brothers fall around me, cursed to a fate worse than death. A fate I myself narrowly escaped. <em>That</em> is what happened to me."</p>

            <p>The lament was Celtic in flavor, each high, mournful note unspooling with aching slowness from the throat of the man singing:</p>

<p><i>The tears I feel today<br>
I’ll wait to shed tomorrow,<br>
Though I’ll not sleep this night<br>
Nor find surcease from sorrow.<br>
My eyes must keep their sight;<br>
I dare not be tear-blinded.<br>
I must be free to speak<br>
Not choked with grief, clear-minded.<br>
My tongue cannot betray<br>
The anguish that I know.<br>
||: I’ll keep my tears till later;<br>
But my grief will never go. :||</i></p>

<p>Derik could rarely bring himself to sing anymore, but he still had a clear, near-perfect upper register. Even off-kilter as he was now, with his sound further disturbed by the ambient Halloween music in the room, it was an uncommon soul that could fail to be moved by it. Even Gall listened quietly, her expression slack.</p>

<p>"For your brothers," said Derik. "For Skepnadth. And for us." He looked around and chuckled. "Normally someone would offer a toast at this point, but I'm already toasted!"</p>

<p>Gall rewarded him for the terrible joke with a punch on the shoulder. "You maniac. Eat your, uh, I think that blob thing is 'Fried Ecto Cooler'."</p>

<p>For the moment, Jenni stood quietly, contemplating.</p>

<p><br>
(( "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXY76t5v8yk">Song for Petiron</a>," from the Pern album <i>Sunset's Gold</i>. Derik may have taken it just a hair faster than the recording. Oh, and yes, fried Ecto Cooler is a real thing. Don't ask me how, but I heard of it on Brad Tries at some point.</p>

            <p>Gall broke hers open and made a revolted face at the gooey, neon green innards. "Ugh, it looks like Fellrazer's poop."</p>

<p>Her being her, she didn't hesitate to put it in her mouth anyway. Derik was right behind her, and they reacted with near-identical sour faces.</p>

<p>"It's so sweet... <i>gack</i>." Derik coughed on the acidic lime fumes in his throat. "Why?"</p>

<p>Gall laughed. "Oh, gods, what is this even supposed to be? It's so gross! Forget what I said earlier; you have to try this." She thrust a greenish fritter at Tom.</p>

<p>Despite being momentarily distracted by the others' antics, Jenni had kept most of her attention on Thoth, and now she spoke up. "Do you still worry about... the flesh-change?" It was a term she was uncomfortable having on her tongue, evoking nightmarish <i>Akira</i>-esque images even without context. She knew the power of names, and agreed that this was one best invoked as little as possible. Yet she had to ask. "Are you afraid that could still happen to you?" This was a two-pronged concern: one for the man himself, one for everyone around him.</p>

            <p>A blond boy dressed as a dragon rider, accompanied by a blue fire-lizard perched on his shoulder, approached, munching on one of the same green fritters. "This is supposed to be a party, not a therapy session." Alex shoved the rest of the pastry in his mouth, cheeks bulging, and he held up his fingers for Zeke to lick.</p>

            <p>Jenni smiled widely despite herself and held out her forearm so the little blue could perch. "Not eating too much junk tonight, I hope?" She rubbed his eye-ridges with one finger and let him feel her affection.</p>

<p>Following the fire-lizard's gaze, her heart sank. "Leave him be, little one," she murmured, and turned to put her body in their line of sight.</p>

<p>"It's fine," Derik growled, turning away himself and handing the half-full plate of snacks off to Gall. "'S time I left anyway—it's a party, after all. I've dragged it down long enough." He pushed himself up with one hand on the back of the chair, and it was a good thing, too, because he swayed on his feet and nearly collapsed as it was.</p>

<p>Gall snorted. "Nice try, buddy. Sit back down! Don't let an ugly, soft little runt like him—eep!"</p>

<p>Derik jerked her forward with his fingers down the neck of her breastplate. The snacks went flying.</p>

            <p>At Alex's touch, Derik jerked and likely would have lashed out at the boy whose every aspect seemed calculated to mock him, but then Thoth was at his back, deep voice rumbling in his ears and his bones. He went still.</p>

<p>Gall took the opportunity to wrench his hand away and step back, glaring. "Do that to me again and I will kick your Spandexed butt, got it?"</p>

<p>Derik shuddered, his muscles shedding their combative tension, and straightened up—well, more or less. He reeled backward, and was rather grateful for support at that moment. "I—I apologize, everyone. I shouldn't—it's not his fault." He gestured vaguely at Alex. "It's not your fault." And at Gall. "Most of all, not the little cousin's fault. I'm sorry." He hid his face behind one hand.</p>

<p>Surprised and relieved not to be the one controlling the situation for a change, Jenni had done her best to keep Zeke calm throughout. Now she felt up for responding to Tom's interest.

            <p>"Oh, all right." With a sigh of capitulation, Derik sank down onto the seat again. He glanced at Alex, but since he'd gone off in conversation with Tom, there wasn't much point in saying anything to him. It was fine. <i>Fine.</i> He took off his green domino mask and rubbed his face, particularly the scarred right side. With the mask off, it was easier to distinguish the blind milky-blue eye from the functioning hazel one, slightly bloodshot. "My tale, my tale," he muttered to himself. "Does it start at the beginning, or the end? There are things I remember that never happened, but they did; things that weren't true, but are. Jenni—" he turned toward her "—how should I start it?"</p>

<p>"You could start when we met, I think," she said, drifting closer. Having been there, she had never heard him speak fully of his recruitment, and she was curious to hear his account.</p>

<p>He nodded. "Yes. Yes, that's fine." He looked up, not at anyone in particular, but into the distance of remembrance. "It was the Hatching. Alanna and I were on the hot sands with Yunith and my Skepnadth, watching over the eggs. It was a proud clutch! But they always were—with such parents, how could they be anything but? What a pair! Yunith, living statue of pure gold; Skepnadth, night-black marbled with bronze. Which he shouldn't have been." Derik's brow creased. "There are five colors, not... but..." He shook his head. "But there we were. There was a queen egg, even though all the Weyrs had a full complement, and a particularly large one at that. At the time my only concern was finding a match for her, but Alanna had everything well in hand—she usually did." His mouth twisted with bitterness. "I remember holding her that day... tall, beautiful, proud. Her hand on my shoulder." He reached up to touch the spot. "She was mine. I loved her. Nothing else mattered." He lapsed into silence.</p>

<p>"That was when I saw you," Jenni put in. "I was there in the viewing gallery with Agents Supernumerary and Ilraen. Oh, I was so angry!"</p>

<p>"Yes, and you made a commotion. I remember that. Everyone looked, and I saw three harpers I didn't know, but I thought nothing of it. I thought nothing much of anything. The four new candidates had come up to us, bowing quite prettily to the sires of the clutch, and Alanna kept the girls near us, near the queen egg. These four had been Searched at the last moment by Yunith herself, a thing unprecedented in the history of Pern. Travelers from another world—but it wasn't the first time we'd had such."</p>

<p>Jenni explained, "It was a crossover with <i>Harry Potter</i>. He's talking about Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Ginny; they'd transported themselves over in a magical accident. Sirius Black and an OC called Roma Lupin were already there. Sirius got there after falling through the Veil. I still have no idea how Roma was supposed to have arrived. They'd both Impressed somehow, even though Sirius at least must have been too old." She shook her head, still irritated by the idiocy of that fic.</p>

<p>"The four newcomers shortly did, too," Derik went on. "That's too much to tell, but suffice to say I now know it was utter nonsense, every moment of it. I mean," he chuckled, "honestly, the rattlesnake-hide bronze. We don't <i>have</i> rattlesnakes on Pern! And there I stood, smiling like an idiot, at least until the gold egg hatched out a little green-gold sport from one end. <i>That</i> was a shocker even then. But Alanna felt she might clutch like a gold, so we decided to train her up as a junior queen, and all was well again. The egg hatched a proper gold from the other half—I say proper, though she wasn't really. <i>Shards</i>, looking back on it I feel like such a benighted fool." He leaned back and sank down in the chair, looking away. "I had two eyes then—how could I not have seen it was all wrong? I was a harper, I knew all the teaching ballads, I—"</p>

<p>"Derik, hush," Jenni said gently. "You were never at fault. That was why I had to get you out of there."</p>

<p>He thought a moment, then picked up the narrative again. "Before the Hatching Feast, Skepnadth and I decided to look in on Yunith, make sure she'd eaten and was resting well. A queen doesn't leave her clutch when it's near to hatching, so she fasts until it's over," he explained. "She had returned to her weyr, and Skepnadth went up ahead of me. He told me two strangers was there, bothering her. I came up the stairs in a hurry, and there was this woman." He indicated Jenni. "Something was odd about her, but neither of us could place it. We went down to the Bowl to avoid disturbing the dragons any further, and she opened my eyes. She reminded me of everything I should have known, but couldn't think of for the fog in my head. She told me what was really happening. Mary Sues—a blight on the universe worse than Thread. Eaters of living ideas, was that what you said?"</p>

<p>Jenni nodded. "Leaving behind only the shiny dead bits to decorate themselves."</p>

<p>"I was one of those," Derik said. "An ornament. An affectation. Not even my name and face were my own!" He leveled a resentful look at Jenni. "You didn't care about me for myself—you cared about <i>him</i>."</p>

<p>She flushed guiltily. "To begin with, maybe. But it was a dragonman I had to win over, not a Phantom. Erik would have been easier to convince."</p>

<p>"I'm not him. I'm not, I'm <i>not</i>."</p>

<p>"I know, hon. We all know."</p>

<p>"Well, mostly," Gall said dubiously. She'd never heard the whole story, either, so she'd hung around to listen.</p>

<p>Jenni shot her a repressive look.</p>

<p>"You haven't seen what I've seen," the Viking protested, but she shut up again.</p>

<p>"The point is," Derik cut back in, raising his voice somewhat more than necessary, "my whole life was a lie, and my only choices were to stay an ignorant thrall and die, or to give up everything I thought I knew and live to find some other purpose for myself and my dragon. I chose the latter, because it was my duty to Pern. Because <i>a dragonman must fly when Threads are in the sky</i>. So I said I would help save Pern from Alanna and the rest." His tone was agitated, self-mocking. "So that's what I set out to do. I went to the Hatching Feast, like I was supposed to. I sat beside her, and I watched, and I waited. The plan was—ah, it went so wrong." He hunched forward, covering his face with both hands. "It never should have come to dragons fighting dragons, but Alanna—Yunith—they went wild. I tried to stop it, we both did." His shoulders shuddered. "He was so brave. My fine bronze. And she killed him. Yunith, his mate, attacked him like a wild feline.</p>

<p>"Ilraen—Ilraen had become a gold dragon himself to keep the Weyr under control, that was the plan, but he couldn't control the morph quickly enough. You can't have a dragon without a rider, it's not possible. He tried to save Skepnadth, but by the time he killed Yunith and the rest of the Sues were under control, it was too late. At least... at least I got to say good-bye before he went <i>between</i>."</p>

<p><br>
(( Stopping there, though it's not quite the end of the story of how Derik became Derik, because good lord that's a long post already, it's taken all day because I actually had work to do at work today (go figure), and I don't have much more time before I have to leave for home. And, well, Derik needs a minute, too.</p>

<p>(( I hope it makes sense, but not so much sense that nobody feels like asking questions about the weirder bits. {= ) ))</p>

            <p>Derik grinned. It was always a disturbing expression on his face at the best of times, distorted as his mouth was on one side, and his tear-damp, splotchy cheeks and bloodshot eyes didn't help. Nor did the fact that what he felt wasn't happiness, but a fatalistic sense of irony.  "I was just about to finish the story of my recruitment," he said. "I was going to skip a certain part, but now I simply can't."</p>

<p>He cleared his throat, which was starting to feel a little dry with all this talking, and began. "Jenni tells me I lay in a catatonic state for roughly a month after she brought me back here, willing myself to die. You see I didn't manage it, even though I didn't have <i>quite</i> the best of care. Headquarters was in the midst of a quarantine thanks to an epidemic of macroviruses, and FicPsych's resources were stretched thin. They had to consolidate their patients in order to protect them. Am I telling it true?" he asked, checking with the nurse.</p>

<p>She nodded, keeping a wary eye on him and Ix. "True. And my bosses still wouldn't let me near you most of the time." She would always resent that, even if there were good reasons for it.</p>

<p>"So it was," Derik went on, "that I was finally roused thanks to the intervention of my erstwhile roommate. The first thing I remember clearly is looking up into the yellow eyes of a man in a full black mask. My ontological progenitor—and yours for the night," he added to Ix, grinning some more. "Erik. The Phantom of the Opera!"</p>

<p>The Halloween soundtrack obligingly filled the pregnant pause with a roll of thunder and some eerie organ music.</p>

<p>Gall flinched and looked around in irritation and real unease. "Jeez, every time!"</p>

<p>Jenni just facepalmed.</p>

<p>"Oh, he had words for me!" Derik chuckled. "Called me 'impostor', accused me of trying to usurp his identity despite not knowing pain as he did. Hah! That made me angry. I felt something for the first time in weeks, and it was anger. I set him straight, and I invited him to kill me as he'd threatened to do. We understood each other then, a pair of scarred, broken souls, alike but unlike, and the bastard let me live. He left, but not before telling me I had a chance to make a new life for myself, and that I'd be a fool not to take it. If you've never heard his voice, you don't know what it's like, but you can't shut it out. It invades you, it gets its hooks in your brain. That voice haunts me. Sometimes it sounds a lot like my own. One more form of torment I can't seem to escape." He glanced at Ix then, but just as quickly looked away again.</p>

            <p>She couldn't shake the feeling that Derik was <em>mad</em> at her. He just seemed so... different from the person who had been so kind to her over messages. </p>

<p>It didn't exactly help her nerves when the soundtrack thundered ominously at the worst possible time. She just hoped nobody had noticed her jump.</p>

<p>"How—" she began, then cleared her throat when her voice was barely above a hoarse whisper. "How did a canon get in HQ?"</p>

            <p>Ix laughed nervously, feeling sweat drip down inside her mask, tickling her cheek. Her face twitched, and she delicately reached inside with a finger to scratch at the irritation, only to yelp when the motion proved enough to dislodge the sticking charm she'd used to hold it in place; the mask fell to the ground and cracked in two.</p>

<p>She looked up at everyone else and blanched, one hand scrabbling for the pieces while the other came up to cover her face. "I, um, um, that's, um, FicPsych, yes, that makes sense, that, um—"</p>

            <p>Derik shook his head as though unsure if he were seeing clearly. Alas, his vision was not the problem. A bit of his right brain had been kicking him for the last few minutes, and he finally understood why. He <i>knew</i> this person. They just hadn't met in person before. She was shy, or so he'd been led to believe.</p>

<p>A random stranger turning up in a Phantom mask? Fine. The universe hated him. Hilarious.</p>

<p>Someone he knew and aspired to mentor, turning up in a Phantom mask, and seeing him like this? He wasn't sure if he felt more betrayed or more ashamed.</p>

<p>He tried vainly to sit up straighter and school his affect to respectability, but he couldn't quite keep a petulant note of accusation from his voice: "Ix? What are you doing here?" He wondered if another drink would be entirely out of the question.</p>

<p><br>
(( Re. bromance, because I forgot to respond to that earlier and I don't want to leave Thoth out entirely while these two have a moment: There are probably as many definitions of bromance as the number of people you ask, but I <i>think</i> it's any platonic yet very close relationship between two guys? It might apply more to comedy situations where the relationship is teased as being <i>not</i> platonic, like JD and Turk on <i>Scrubs</i>, or Shawn and Gus on <i>Psych</i>, but I dunno.</p>

<p>(( Any way you slice it, I'm digging the idea of Derik and Agent!Thoth bonding and being friends. The parallels between them are weird, unexpected, and cool. I hope it survives sobriety. {= ) ))</p>

            <p>Ix finally managed to snatch up the pieces of the mask and repair them with her wand, quickly shoving it back onto her very red face. "Charlotte—my partner—she wanted to come a-and she thought this would be a good costume for me—I didn't realize, I, I—" She realized she was starting to hyperventilate and forced herself to take several deep breaths.

            <p>Shame had won out. He raked his fingers up through his hair, which had been gelled down for the occasion, and thus he succeeded only in making himself look even more disheveled. "I am being very self-indulgent, Ix," he said with the profound solemnity of the very drunk. "Very selfish. I—I didn't want you to know me like this." He fidgeted, growing agitated again, and mumbled: "I should, um... I need the necessary." He got to his feet, swayed, and put out a forbidding arm. "Nobody help me. I'll go. You stay." He staggered off into the crowd.</p>

<p>Jenni shifted anxiously on her feet. "I'll go after him. I'm sure it's fine, but... I'll go after him."</p>

<p>Gall looked around, shrugged, and took Derik's chair. She leaned forward and looked up challengingly up at Ix. "So <i>how</i> do you know my partner?"</p>

(( Well, it had to happen at some point after seven drinks. Honestly, now that we've started this scenario, I'm struggling to know what to do with it. So, buying Derik some time to flip into a more conducive mood. If you don't like the weather, just wait five minutes! ))</p>

            <p>Theo said as he walked up to Thoth, giving the Space Marine a once over. "I could have sworn that that's the colour of a Space Wolf though. Kudos to you for giving it a go." </p>

<p>For his part Theo was dressed up in black trouser, with a red t-shirt that was covered by a black coat with red lining inside, black and red gloves covered both of his hands while an ornate white and red mask covered his eyes. "Although I warn you, this stupid mask gives me less than ideal vision." </p>

<p>"You're one to talk about less than ideal vision" Cinnabar said as she pushed through to where her partner was standing, she was wearing ornate red, black and gold robes with a heavy golden helmet on her head, rather thin eye-slots the only opening in it, meaning she had to remove it every time she wanted to eat or drink. "I still don't know how you convinced me to wear all of this."</p>

It was a long way up: although the Thanagarian hawk helm she wore granted her an extra few inches, in reality she was all of 5'4". But she wasn't in the habit of letting petty things like reality slow her down. "I like your style, brother," she remarked. "You look like you could pose a challenge. I'm so in.

<p>A Green Lantern with lacy scars extending above and below his domino mask on the right side pushed his way over and eyed the gathering skeptically. By the looks of the glass in his hand, he was already a leg up on thematic pumpkin spice ale. "This is a bad idea."</p>

<p>(( I don't know how much time I'll have to participate, but if I drop out at some point, you may assume that Normal Humans Derik and Gall put up a valiant fight, but have absolutely zero chance of actually winning, handicap or no. Oh, and Gall is probably gonna hit on Thoth a bit, cuz Viking, and I'm sure he'll appreciate that just <i>so</i> much. <em>g</em> ))</p>

            <p>"Oh, no," Derik muttered.</p>

<p>She burst into song:</p>

<p><i>Drinking mead in the halls of Whiterun<br>
The maidens and the men!</i>—</p>

<p>"Gall, please, not this," Derik groaned, but she ignored him.</p>

<p>This was by way of being her answer to the question. Having not the slightest notion of what she was actually asking for, she held out a hand and beckoned eagerly. "Bring it on!"</p>

<p>"You know I <i>hate</i> that song," growled Derik, ex-dragonrider of Pern. If looks could kill, Gall was lucky his expression was partially masked.</p>

<p>"Yeah, but you're gonna drown your sorrows in booze anyway." She turned back to Thoth. "Come on, <i>jötunn</i>, show me what you got." She winked.</p>

<p>Tom produced two glasses, and Thoth, giving a glare that could cut stone to Gall, poured some of the liquid into each. "I feel that you would work well with those I came dressed as. A pity then: I am not them. However, the necessity of Bleeproducts in our line of work means that I have learned to drink like them." He casually took a glass and quickly downed it.</p>

<p>((You've read <em>Prospero Burns</em>? I've been meaning to get to that. Newbie that I am, I've not read many of the novels yet. I started with <em>A Thousand Sons</em> (for reasons that should be obvious), and I was working my way through the Ahriman books when Real Life happened. <em>Crimson King</em> is sitting on my floor right now.</p>

<p>What? I like to be informed about my faction! :-D. It helps that McNeil is pretty good usually from what I can tell, and that John French nailed everything that makes Ahriman great - a fact he managed to convince me of over the course of a two page introduction. I suppose I'll see if his writing can match.))</p>

            <p>She held up her glass and swirled the dark, viscous fluid—more like petroleum or blood than beer or ale—around the bottom. The substance had a strong, chemical reek that made her cough, but she turned the reaction into a noise of derision. "You call this muck mead, do you? When this is over, I'll introduce you to the real thing."</p>

<p>"Gall..." Derik's sense of caution broke through his anger. "Maybe you shouldn't—"</p>

<p>"Shut up, Derik," she snapped. She was committed, and there was no backing out now. With a deep breath to fortify herself, she locked eyes with Thoth and knocked back the whole shot.</p>

<p>It was fortunate that HQ was governed primarily by the Laws of Narrative Comedy, and by that token, what happened next was completely predictable: Gall shuddered and tried valiantly to hold on, but her stomach was smarter than she was. She convulsed, retched, and spewed the noxious brew right back up again, saving herself from committing suicide by stupidity. It was quite unfortunate to be standing in front of her.</p>

<p>Derik shook his head and patted her on the back while she hacked up the last drops of mjød. "On second thought, some fights aren't worth fighting. I'll stick to pumpkin spice ale."</p>

<p><br>
(( If the Comedic Laws are in full force, Thoth will need to go clean his armor, but that's up to your discretion. {= D</p>

<p>(( And yes, I've read approximately two and a half Horus Heresy books now: <i>Prospero Burns</i>, <i>A Thousand Sons</i>, and the first few short stories in <i>Tales of Heresy</i>. I'm an extreme noob, but Phobos has been reading these books for a while now, and he finally talked me into starting. I'm afraid we're a Wolves household through and through, but I do feel sorry for Magnus and the Thousand Sons.</p>

<p>(( As for Ahriman, I don't get him. Half the time I thought he was the one with the most common sense of the lot, but the other half he was making the same dumb mistakes as everyone else, and from the fanart I've looked at, he seems to go full-on Dark Lord down the line. What on earth made him think making the same mistakes as Magnus was a good idea when he'd lived through the consequences, eh? ))</p>

            <p>"It's ale, you know. Not mead. Not that it makes much of a difference with that stuff. Just be glad you hacked it up: I don't have any Klatchian Coffee handy." He produced some rags. "That's for your mouth. Here, Thoth, take a few to wipe off your armor with. And don't try to burn it off or anything: the smell will get everwhere."</p>

<p>He turned to Derik. "Sorry about that. Anyways, I think I saw some of the spice ale at the table..." He went off and grabbed a glass. "There you go."</p>

<p>Thoth frowned at Gall. "That was... an interesting decision." He had managed to wipe most of the ale off of his armor... before burning the rest. Thankfully, the smell was minimal.</p>

<p>((The Wolves ARE cool. But I'll always come down on the Sons side of that particular debate. Besides, I don't seem to like The Wolves as much as everybody else...))</p>

<p>((Now Ahriman... Ahriman is an interesting case. He's actually self-conscious enough to recognize his flaws a good deal of the time, and he's reasonably sensable, but he ultimately has the same flaws as the rest of his legion. Primarily, arrogance.</p>

<p>As for going full dark lord... he actually doesn't. Which is one of the cool things about him. Heck, he has no particular desire to serve Chaos at all (a trait he shares with several other named characters most people barely discuss). After the Rubric (I assume you know what happened with the Rubric), he was... distraught. And so he dedicated himself to reversing its effects. Imagine Edward Elric with absolutely no limits, nothing he won't do, and a devotion to his goal that is arguably <em>even more fanatical</em>. THAT is Ahriman, or at least the closest approximation I can give with a simple analogy.</p>

<p>DISCLAIMER: Ahriman is probably one of my favorite characters in all of 40k. Take that as you will.)</p>

            <p>She took off her hawk helm, revealing a head of dark, wiry red hair plaited against her scalp, and mopped off her face. To Thoth's comment, she replied hoarsely between heavy breaths: "I'm Gall Knutson, Fellrazer's rider, of the Hairy Hooligan tribe. 'Interesting' is what we do. If by 'interesting' you mean brave, stubborn, and just a little bit insane." She grinned—no hard feelings. As far as she was concerned, anyone who could outdrink or outfight the likes of herself was to be admired. "The hell are you made of, <i>jötunn</i>?"</p>

<p>Derik, meanwhile, sank his ale in a few steady gulps and slammed the glass down on a nearby table. "One. And, in good news, I think I just spied Nurse Robinson as the spitting image of <i>S.H.I.E.L.D.</i>'s Maria Hill. I think she keeps Purple Stuff handy for occasions like this."</p>

<p><br>
(( I didn't know about the Rubric, but I looked it up, so now I sorta do. Yikes!</p>

<p>(( Can't speak for everyone else, but I like the Wolves because a: I like Vikings and Viking analogues in general, and b: I have a soft spot for big, hairy, unpretentious warrior-types. The Wolves are bloody awesome at what they do, but they know their place, and their limits, and there's a lot of heart under all the gruff, too. All the Legions Astartes have that warrior-brother thing going on, it seems, but I suspect the Wolves take that to a relatively high level what with the wolf traits making them a pack, too. I 'unno, but they're not what I expected from Space Marines going in, and I like it.</p>

<p>(( The Thousand Sons, on the other hand, are nice enough guys, and pretty cool, but make me want to pull my hair out with frustration at their basic lack of common sense. That said, I don't think what happened to them was really their fault. I blame the Emperor for trying to make a bunch of addicts quit cold-turkey and getting mad when, shockingly, it didn't work. {= P ))</p>

<p>Thoth nodded to Gall. "I am Thoth, of the XVth legion Astartes, otherwise known as the Thousand Sons. I am - or was - the unwilling servant of the Architect of Fate, and have my origins in the Warhammer 40k continuum. My partner is Tom Andrews."</p>

<p>Tom bowed. "Tom Andrews, computational demonologist, at your service. I'd tell you where I'm from, but then my brain would fry. It seems there was only so much DoSAT could do about that."</p>

<p>((If you're curious, Tom's from the Laundry continuum. So he's not exaggerating: if he tells you where he's from or where he worked or anything of that sort, he'll probably start smoking. DoSAT loosened it a bit, but they could only do so much.))</p>

<p>((I can appreciate the Wolves for similar reasons - Vikings are cool, and I do have that same soft spot. And they're a good legion. But the Sons... ah, there's just a bit too much of the Sons in me for me to prefer anyone else. Because I want to know the universe, to understand it. And if I am to be guilty of any crime, I want it to be the pursuit of knowledge. I also share some of their flaws... :-(</p>

<p>As for it not being their fault... I kind of disagree. But I'm not going to get into the reasons why, because it would take ages and I'm typing this on my phone. But I also have a soft spot for villains who are doing the wrong thing for the right reasons. And many of the Sons fit that to a T, especially Ahriman.))</p>

<p>He sighed.

It is the only way that the Bleep works on me."</p>

<p>"As for the third... the hypno-doctrination took care of that. The requisite equipment is still there, but the urges have been... largely repressed. They no longer serve any function."</p>

<p>((Bleeprin would not work on Space Marines for the same reasons alcohol doesn't. It's a toxin, and most toxins don't work properly on Space Marines.</p>

<p>Fun fact: most Space Marines have variable skin tone, the two exceptions of the original <del>20</del> 18 legions being the Raven Guard and the Salamanders.

BL writers (who I tend to favor over codices for lore, because it seems like the good ones care a lot more) seem to be split on how effective hypo-doctrination IS. Because if it was as effective as the game says it is, things would be boring. So it's commonly agreed that Space Marines CAN, for example, feel fear (contrary to game fluff) - it's just repressed. But sexual desire... well, Emperor's Children, to get the elephant in the room out of the way, but other than that, the jury's out on whether it's entirely nonexistant or merely deeply repressed. Or even if the requisite equipment can function.</p>

<p>The interpretation Mikel and I subscribe to is that it is <em>there</em>, and the equipment does more or less function (no clue if conception's possible: I'd say no), but it is <em>deeply</em> repressed. This is substantiated by several novels, most notably the Ragnar Blackmane series that serves as the mainline of Space Wolf novels (which I should REALLY read at some point). OTOH, there's also evidence to contrary. So...))</p>

            <p>He, too, was sporting a flush by now, which made the pale scars on his right cheek stand out even more. He shook his head and chuckled at his partner's aghast expression. "It isn't as though it could have worked out either way, you know." He held up one hand at Gall's head-height, then raised his arm as far as it would go to indicate Thoth's.</p>

<p>"Oh yeah?" Gall stuck out her right arm. On her wrist, she wore a device that looked a bit like a watch, but had a curious ring around the outside of the face.</p>

<p>Derik blinked, then groaned in comprehension and checked himself out of explaining by finally drinking his fourth ale.</p>

<p>"See," said Gall, "I got this handy bit of tech that lets me shrink my dragon so he fits in the RC. But it works the other way, too." She waggled her eyebrows. "So, <i>jötunn</i>, if you ever wanna get un-repressed, I'm your girl."</p>

<p>"I'll have the next drink <i>quickly</i>, please," Derik said grimly to Tom. He cast Thoth a baleful look through his one functioning eye. "You don't agree with her, though, do you? Those things are not what makes life worthwhile. It's duty, loyalty, joy... and if all else fails, just duty."</p>

<p><br>
(( I haven't settled on what sort of drunk I think Derik is, but it looks like "voluble" is gonna be part of it. {= P</p>

<p>(( But uh, yeah, I started off thinking Gall was more or less just being ridiculous for the sake of riling people up (not that she was succeeding; Thoth seems to be a rather phlegmatic sort)—but then I remembered Fellrazer's collar and realized it's actually plausible from her end. {X D She's still mostly playing, but what with all the most powerful guys in HtTYD!Viking culture being ridiculously huge, there's a little part of her brain going "just imagine the <i>status</i> that would come from pairing with a guy like this!" and "think of the looks on people's faces if I told them; hilarious!"</p>

<p>(( I'd tend to agree that an Astartes' reproductive capability is probably nuked as a side effect all the physical and chemical processes done to them, if not deliberately. It wouldn't do to have your supersoldiers distracted by family ties, assuming anyone would or <i>could</i> successfully partner with them. Regarding the Emperor's Children, from what Phobos tells me, it's implied that they're into just about everything, and outright stated that the humans with them definitely are, but it's not outright stated about the Astartes, at least not in the books he's read so far. Is it actually spelled out somewhere?</p>

<p>(( ... I like biology. I think about these things. &gt;.&gt;; ))</p>

            <p>"I might want one as well, actually..." He grabbed some more alcohol. </p>

<p>"Yes," said Thoth, softly. "Duty." He downed his drink, with noticeable haste. "Knowledge. Understanding. That is what makes life worth living. There is no higher calling then the persuit of knowledge. If I am to be a criminal, then that is my crime." It appeared he wasn't exactly talking to those around him.</p>

<p>Finally, his eyes focused on Gall. "I have no interest in your offer. And I do not think that you do either. Not for me. For the man whose paint I wear tonight, perhaps."</p>

<p>((Thoth is, I think, a rather solemn drunk...))</p>

<p>((I recall the EC's... tastes being outright stated. If they aren't, they're all but. Then again, a lot of what I read doesn't come from the novels, and GW's canon policy makes things murky at the best of times.</p>

<p>As for supersoldiers not being distracted by family ties... Don't tell The Salamanders, who maintain their families after becoming Astartes, and place a high value on family in general.</p>

<p>The Salamanders are basically the nicest guys in 40k this side of The Lamenters. They also really like fire.))</p>

<p>Gall folded her arms. "Well, can you put me in touch with that guy, then? Thor's beard, why are all the really buff dudes around here either taken or too messed up to appreciate what's in front of them?" Here she shot a resentful glare at Derik.</p>

<p>He slammed the latest glass down slightly harder than was rational. "You try being enthralled to a Mary Sue and losing everything that mattered, then see how you feel," he growled, then shook himself and turned to the other two. "Sorry. She does this on purpose. No empathy, this one, none at all. Knowledge is good," he went on, "knowledge is vastly preferable to ignorance, but without the wisdom to use it as it ought, that's how we end up in these situations."

            <p>Thoth grabbed the next glass forcefully, pouring it down his throat. "I suppose I could. The next time the chance comes up, I could recruit one of them.

            <p>Faced with drink six plus one and rapidly taking up the previous ones, Derik groggily weighed the merits of his options and decided, based on experience, that he'd reached the limits of his tolerance, so there was no point in risking death on something as stupid as this contest. Instead, he lurched forward and put a clutching hand on Thoth's vambrace. All dragonriders had some latent empathic Talent, and Derik's was enough to widen the scope of his anger to encompass them both.</p>

<p>"I think we're the same," he said. "Or similar. The universe is cruel—it takes everything, and it makes you keep going anyway, even when you're not sure who you are anymore, or what's the point. We should talk... sometime we're not both extremely drunk. Or when I'm not. I don't know about you. Oh, by the way, you win." He nodded solemnly and belched some more. "And I will never drink anything pumpkin spice again, because it is <i>vile</i> when it repeats on you."</p>

            <p>He was distracted by the arrival of a newcomer in a dark blue S.H.I.E.L.D. jumpsuit. She'd taken advantage of Tom's slipstream to make her way to them through the crowd. "Is everything all right over here?" she said, taking in the scene with a pair of concerned green eyes. "I thought I heard—oh, Derik. Again?"</p>

<p>"Jenni!" Derik's expression had lit in recognition, but just as quickly collapsed back into the intense concentration it was now taking to string words together. "Thoth. Tom. This is Jenni—Nurse Robinson. She recruited me, but it's not her fault. What happened, it's not her fault. I have given it a lot of thought, and it was the Suvians, not her. She's good. She understands what it's like, and she's the only one who does, because she's been there. Sort of." He looked to Jenni. "You tell him."</p>

<p>Jenni, looking mortified with guilt no matter what Derik said, shook her head. "Derik, why don't you let go of this fellow and come with me for a minute?" She evaluated him again. "... You're clinging for dear life, aren't you? Can you walk on your own?"</p>

<p>"Ah." Derik looked down at himself, considering. "No, I don't think so. Sorry," he said to Thoth, swaying as he tilted his head up.</p>

<p>Jenni sighed and turned to Tom. "Make yourself useful and find a chair, would you?"</p>

<p><br>
(( Long one, sorry. But I'm actually trying not to end the RP just yet, because I'm having fun. {= ) You're doing fine, too. It's a little tricky for me to get a read on what Thoth is feeling based just on his speech, because he's so formal, but that's okay. What does confuse me a bit is that I'd expected a seeker after knowledge to be more curious about people from other worlds, so I was trying to draw him to ask questions about my guys, but perhaps he's disciplined against prying?</p>

<p>(( In any case, I'd like to continue in my efforts to push his buttons for my own (and hopefully your) amusement, so I'm throwing Jenni at him. I don't know how psychic he is without actively trying to be, but if he's got any kind of passive sense of auras or energies or whatnot, he's probably going to notice she's not quite what she appears to be, and since the closest 40K analogue to what she actually is is probably a Warp demon... Well, I'm hoping he notices. {= D But only if it's in character for him, of course. ))</p>

<p>She held off responding further in favor of pulling Derik's free arm across her shoulders and easing him off Thoth and down onto the chair. He was significantly larger and heavier than her, but she was experienced at this sort of thing. "Come on, hon... there you go. Don't go falling off, all right?"</p>

<p>He nodded, and she briefly cupped the unscarred left side of his face before straightening up and facing the others.</p>

            <p>She eyed Tom's phone guardedly, but forced a half-smile. "I wasn't expecting some sort of Spanish Inquisition."</p>

<p>"No one expects the Spanish Inquisition!" Derik slurred loudly. It was widely held that one was not a proper PPC agent until one could quote Monty Python at the drop of a hat, so he'd learned.</p>

<p>"Thank you, dear." Jenni patted his shoulder.</p>

<p>At that point, Gall returned to the group carrying a plate piled high with snacks, acting like nothing odd had happened. "So I grabbed a bunch of pretzels—oh, hey, Green-eyes—and anything else that looked bready or greasy," she told Derik. "I don't want to drag your unconscious ass back to the RC if I don't have to, so eat." She stuffed a deviled egg into her own mouth and put the plate in his lap. "You lot can get your own," she said to Tom and Thoth, though if they understood her it would be quite the feat.</p>

<p><br>
(( A little background for reference: Jenni is an original character from an original universe. I dunno exactly how she'll look to Tom's device, but her natural ethereal form is sort of a cloud of energy, green-blue-brown-silver. Her physical form is real, but I guess it works similarly to how the Maiar work in Middle-earth, so it's basically like a favorite outfit for her, and she could change it if she wanted to. The only outward sign that she's not a normal human is that her gaze can be penetrating and her eyes can almost seem to flash or glow in intense moments. (A bit Suvian, I know, but it's never overt, and I like the "windows to the soul"/"the eyes don't lie" tropes.) Being an ethereal with a direct connection to the energetic underpinnings of the universe, she's also extremely psychic, but she usually keeps that under tight wraps out of politeness. God, no; phenomenal cosmic power in an itty-bitty living space, yes. To Thoth, I suspect she's an incredibly luminous presence, but tightly controlled rather than flaring out. (Derik of course is barely there at all, being merely a latent Talent in McCaffrey terms, and Gall is dull as lead.) Lemme know if I can clarify anything for you. ))</p>

I'd tell you mine, but... well, I already mentioned: bound by <em>geas</em>, if I tell you my brain probably starts fizzing." He frowned. "Oh, and don't worry about Thoth. He hasn't tried to read anyone's mind since... well, the point is, don't worry."</p>

Gall planted a fist on her hip. "I'm from the filmverse, and it's awesome. It's not just one movie, either, it's two going on three, and a show, too!"</p>

<p>"Technically," Derik put in, stumbling over the long word a bit, "you're from a badfic in the filmverse. I should know—I recruited you. And I've regretted it ever since." He was obediently doing his best to consume some ballast to the booze in his stomach, but it was slow going.</p>

<p>"I love you, too," Gall sneered.</p>

<p>"I don't <i>regret</i> it," he rambled on, seemingly oblivious to the contradiction, "but you're a constant reminder, you know. You and Fellrazer." He swung his gaze up to Thoth. "Bleeprin doesn't work for me," he said, "because the memories that hurt so much are the good ones. I can only forget those when I'm unconscious, so that's why I drink like this." He said this matter-of-factly, as though relating a simple universal constant.</p>

<p>Jenni, however, looked pained on his behalf. She squeezed his shoulder again and filled in softly: "<i>Dragonriders of Pern</i> continuum. Know it?"</p>

            <p>She glanced down at Derik, who'd sagged in his seat and turned away to stare into the middle distance. Pressing her lips together, she resolved to speak further. "On the other hand, Sybok had a point about dragging it out into the light. What you need to know about Pern," she said, returning to the point, "is that the dragonriders have an indelible telepathic bond with their dragons from the moment of Impression at the dragon's hatching until death. A total sharing of the psyche—a constant companion who knows the depths of your soul and loves you unconditionally. There's nothing else like it. Nothing comes close." Tears welled in her eyes, and she blinked them away. "If that bond is broken, it shatters you. Riders rarely survive the death of their dragon, and even if they do, they're never whole again."</p>

<p>"Then there's the whole freaky Phantom of the Opera thing," Gall added, swiping a couple of chocolate-covered pretzels, decorated like bats, and crunching loudly. "Don't forget that."</p>

(( One of Gall's jobs as the insensitive jerk character is to keep everyone from wallowing in angst too much. {= )</p>

<p>(( DroP IS good, but more for the worldbuilding than the actual writing, in my more informed mature-adult\* opinion. Characterization is not McCaffrey's strong suit. But I love Pern, and if you can get past the occasional cringiness of the text, it's an awesome series. ... Well, up until <i>Skies of Pern</i>, anyway.</p>

<p>"Or maybe talk to anyone <em>you</em> want to? It's a party-- you've gotta learn when to relax," said Jack, stepping beside him and taking a sip of the ice cold apple cider behind the unmoving Detective. </p>

<p>"Give me a few minutes, and I'll join you," he promised, pressing a button at the back of the mask so that the carefully crafted back pieces slid up into the transparent faceplate and cleared the helmet for removal. He messed his now dampened and scruffy hair up off his forehead and offered a small smile of reassurance to his partner. </p>

<p>Jack nodded, and left to go and mingle among the guests, and the Detective replaced his mask behind him. </p>

            <p>Richard Legard was wearing a black trench coat with a gray collared shirt, black trousers, dark brown Cuban heeled boots, and a pair of red gloves.  He also had a white bird-shaped mask with a black design around the eyes. The ensemble was pretty much out of a Disguise Generator. Marina Nicodelli had traded her black coat for a brown trenchcoat, the silver crucifix around her neck for a silver pentagram, and was holding a carved staff, with some cavity at the top of it.</p>

<p>"That's a rather easy disguise, you know Marina?" Richard said quitely.</p>

<p>"You were the one who gave me the idea, Richard," the dark-haired wizard said with a small smirk. "And a good one actually. And you can talk, with your DORKS."</p>

<p>"I couldn't find the right clothes, and... I don't think I'd have any chances of making something myself."</p>

<p>"Yeah. let's see if we can meet someone interesting".</p>

<p>Without further ado, the two of them splitted up, Richard wandering around while Marina went to the bar.</p>

            <p>"'Efforts'? I... pretty much leaped on the idea while my partner was agonizing between disguises. The staff is a work in progress, and I took the coat and amulet he had prepared. He's the guy wandering around there, with the black coat, the mask and the curly hair. He cheated too, but belive me, that's for the better for him. I didn't really care for a particular disguise at the time, and was fully ready to go as myself and tell I was actually disguised as a wizard. Richard pointed out how ironic it was that I was one coat away from being disguised as Dresden, and the idea was just impossible to ignore. Besides, it did help him to make his own choice. He was thinking about throwing a dice to make his decision before that."</p>

            <p>The whole idea of the PPC seems to be killing existing Sues, so the idea of writing your own badfic specifically for your characters to spork seems to take away from the spirit of this group, no matter how &quot;mean&quot; it seems. (You did read the part of the wiki that said it is inadvisable to show an original author their killed, fic, yes?) The impression I get is that part of the fun of finding a real badfic is that moment of &quot;Oh my god, someone actually wrote this and thought it was a good idea.&quot; It just seems like making up your own badfics for the sake of being killed in the story takes away from that because it&#39;s not like we can laugh along with the agents.<br>These are just my thoughts, I don&#39;t know if there&#39;s a seniority thing here and if I&#39;m totally out of line. </p>

            <p>-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----<br>Hash: SHA512<br><br>Hi Pasty Greens,<br><br>You are right and I actually agree that it&#39;s much more natural and much more organic to find a real badfic. In some cases, much more satisfying as well. <br><br>I mentioned somewhere in this thread a bit more about why, but I&#39;ll sum it here: around 2010, the PPC came under fire publicly when a writer accused them of cyberbullying other people over their Mary Sues. It was quite a lot of bad press. I am cautious by nature, so rather than try to manage the risk of accidentally stomping all over someone&#39;s ego, even by accident, I&#39;ve decided to eliminate the risk entirely. <br><br>This is just something I will do on my own, since I believe that other people here may be more capable of managing that risk than me. <br>-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----<br><br>iLQEARMKAB0WIQTfllUBtaeNnRzzfmVK3+74uImA+wUCWe6iBwAKCRBK3+74uImA<br>++hcAgCiUDuatToZTdSEeAestjOnBaiSoomr81hca7xcg+L36kcdLSZhTb+OURGJ<br>PS96aKQB6BpYERQjLthbl7uwPc2JAfQOio6flS3VkaLx/+IzGAHii7Jw0i3PISR6<br>jWmE7X4nHA5niLPN449DV/qoVUj4IjfXiuTNrFfggD3d1GyJwmI=<br>=Kq3i<br>-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----<br></p>

            <p>To answer your question: I personally think so. If you&#39;re (say) interpreting a quirky turn of phrase overly-literally, it&#39;s much more entertaining to know that it&#39;s &#39;natural&#39; than to know that you wrote it yourself.<br><br>But other people disagree. <i>In-universe</i>, all badfics sporked by the PPC exist on the same level.

            <p>Okay, first, some housekeeping:<br><br>-Your need to put PGP signatures on everything feels kind of like a lack of trust in the PPC. Okay, you use Tor - that&#39;s not actually banned. But assuming that we&#39;ll look at a troll claiming to be you and go &#39;onoes we must have misjudged TripleDES all this time BANBANBAN&#39; is... strange? Because we&#39;re not actually sitting here looking for any excuse to ban you.<br><br>-Given that people may be using either a phone or a browser, it&#39;s usually better to provide something that can be read on either. Google Docs work perfectly for this, since they adjust to the screen width. Your Permission Request is very difficult to read on the PC. It&#39;s also hard to copy and paste quotes from, since things like linebreaks don&#39;t show up at all on the copy.<br><br>-The reason for the character bios being requested at 200 words is that you shouldn&#39;t need to put much in them. The purpose of the bios is to check that you haven&#39;t slipped something Suvian into the backstory or powers that doesn&#39;t show up in the writing sample. That&#39;s it. It&#39;s not so we get their entire life story.<br><br>Now, onto the request itself. I&#39;m going to go through this in order and comment on what I see:<br><br>-<i>&#39;Because I don’t feel right bullying other people over their Mary Sues...&#39;</i> This is an immediate warning bell for me. Do you think the PPC is about bullying people? In your explanation to Iximaz, you use language such as <i>&#39;taking huge amounts of flak and ridicule from someone anonymous&#39;</i>, which suggests you kind of do.<br><br>That isn&#39;t what we do. The PPC community is <i>very clear</i> about the distinction between authors and their characters. Comment on the characters doing stupid things, but <i>never</i> say a word about the authors. And that&#39;s not in a &#39;nudge nudge, that Sue is so badly written she probably lived in her mother&#39;s basement in a previous life, NOT TALKING ABOUT THE WRITER hehe&#39; sense - it&#39;s that we recognise that writing is an art form, and one that takes practice. We were all bad writers once, and many of us have PPC&#39;d our own stories for it. That doesn&#39;t say anything about us as people, and if anyone thinks that poking fun at badfics is a stand-in for mocking the authors, I advise them to think again - several times.<br><br>(Also, I realise you&#39;re into the crypto thing, but honestly? It&#39;s ridiculously easy to find my name on the internet, but I&#39;d still be &#39;anonymous to the majority of bad fic authors&#39;. So is every reviewer on Fanfiction.net. Most people don&#39;t try and find out who&#39;s &#39;really&#39; talking to them.)<br><br>-Your first agent is a canon character (indeed, the main protagonist), albeit in a fiction canon. There go the alarm bells again. Have you read Jasper Fforde&#39;s <i>Jurisfiction</i> books? Because it seems like your notion of how the world of fiction works is closer to that than to the PPC&#39;s model. You talk about <i>John Smith has since sought work as a fictional character in other venues</i>, but in the PPC multiverse, canon characters don&#39;t get to wander off when their series ends. They exist in closed universes - &#39;realised&#39; to a greater or lesser extent, but always there. They don&#39;t move between them, and they don&#39;t &#39;notice&#39; when new installments come out - that&#39;s just their timeline, for all it&#39;s still being written.<br><br>-You also talk about &#39;a character shield which is powered by two AAA batteries... protects a character from all harm... only for the hero designated by the writers&#39;. Again, this assumes a completely different worldview than that used by the PPC: one in which writers wander into their fiction, and are known by their creations (and can issue technology to an entire genre, somehow). I&#39;ll admit it&#39;s an amusing idea, and would work pefectly in <i>Jurisfiction</i>, but not in the PPC.<br><br>-Your second agent is also a canon character, and has exactly the same issues: she exists in a world where she can wander between fiction at will, and is &#39;out of work&#39; since her show&#39;s cancellation.<br><br>-You wrote over 500 words on their car. Here is what you actually needed to write: &#39;Instead of a normal Response Centre, John and Ayumi use an old car, to make them more like a buddy cop movie&#39;. That&#39;s what I mean by overkill. :)<br><br>-If your agents are in the Department of Floaters, their department head is the Floating Hyacinth, who isn&#39;t prone to yelling. <i>&#39;the trope of an angry, yelling police chief&#39;</i> may well be common, but it would be a big change to the PPC canon.<br><br>-The Department of Floaters isn&#39;t just about what canon they work in - it&#39;s about what type of missions they tackle. From the All-Purpose Department wiki page:<br><br><i>The All-Purpose Department contains agents who are willing to work in only one fandom but accept all types of missions. Compare to the Department of Floaters, whose agents may work in any fandom and take any type of mission, and the DMS and DBS&#39;s Freelance Divisions, whose agents may work in any fandom but only do assassinations or exorcisms, respectively.</i><br><br>So if you&#39;re only intending to tackle Mary-Sues, pop them in DMS-Freelance instead.<br><br>-Surprisingly, I have no problem with the idea of a portalling car. I&#39;m not sure what the &#39;real&#39; effect of the travel montage is, though - what do John and Ayumi actually experience? Do they sit in the car and watch it play out on the screen? Do they get teleported from scene to scene?<br><br>-<i>&#39;Typical  for  police  dramas,  both  Ayumi  and John  carry badges.&#39;</i> Uh... what canon are you writing for, again? Because it doesn&#39;t sound like you want to write for the PPC at all.<br><br>... I&#39;m skipping ahead.<br><br>-I&#39;m looking through the &#39;writing sample&#39;, and... you&#39;re not writing the PPC. You don&#39;t mention <i>anything</i> from the PPC. Other than &#39;killing badfic&#39;, your story has nothing to do with the PPC.<br><br>So... good news! To write a buddy cop show about John and Ayumi, badfic police extraordinaire, their quirky old car, and their shouty Chief who wants Their Badges And Guns You&#39;re Off The Case, <b>you don&#39;t need Permission</b>! :D You can write it, post it somewhere (I recommend <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/">fanfiction.net</a>, though some prefer <a href="https://archiveofourown.org/">Archive of Our Own</a>), and let people read it! I&#39;m sure there are people here in the PPC who&#39;d love to beta it for you - folks whose interests include the intersection of anime and action - and we&#39;d be happy for you to plug it on the Board when it&#39;s up so we can take a look.<br><br>But it&#39;s not a PPC story, so it doesn&#39;t need PPC Permission. Case... closed.<br><br>-----BEGIN CHEEKY HUINESORON SIGNATURE-----<br><br>hS<br><br>-----END CHEEKY HUINESORON SIGNATURE-----</p>

            <p>-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----<br>Hash: SHA512<br><br>Hey Huinesoron,<br><br>Inline:<br><br>&gt; Now, onto the request itself. I&#39;m going to go through this in <br>&gt; order and comment on what I see:<br><br>Thank you for having a look at my piece and approaching it with an open mind. I would really like to know what you felt about the story itself, especially with respect to John and Ayumi&#39;s chemistry and the way they interacted, since I haven&#39;t written this pair of characters before. Much of this was very off-the-cuff, so I&#39;m eager to hear feedback on it. <br><br>&gt; -Your need to put PGP signatures on everything feels kind of l<br>&gt; ike a lack of trust in the PPC. Okay, you use Tor - that&#39;s not<br>&gt; actually banned. But assuming that we&#39;ll look at a troll claim<br>&gt; ing to be you and go &#39;onoes we must have misjudged TripleDES a<br>&gt; ll this time BANBANBAN&#39; is... strange? Because we&#39;re not actua<br>&gt; lly sitting here looking for any excuse to ban you.<br><br>The reason I put PGP signatures on everything is not because I distrust the PPC, it is because I do not trust other users on Tor. <br><br>What my worry is, may be something like a user such as Bramadin, who had previously attempted to claim my identity and pose as me, or perhaps some Internet troll coming in and misbehaving while trying to pose as me. It would be fairly difficult to ban an abusive user that also uses Tor without banning me in the process as well. <br><br>I understand the risks of using Tor to access public sites, and have come to expect that occasionally, Tor may be blacklisted on sites I visit because of abuse or spam. If that does happen, I&#39;ll understand and won&#39;t take it personally, and will return when all has settled down (although I might try to contact you by E-mail to see if everything is alright first, or I might wait for an &quot;all-clear&quot; from someone in the PPC before I try to come back).<br><br>The PGP signatures are a little bit of insurance. They&#39;re a technological guarantee that while someone may be able to steal my screen name, they won&#39;t be able to steal my online identity with you guys, so long as you guys have the real key that belongs to the real me. [See Footnote 1]<br><br>If you guys have my real, genuine key, you&#39;d be able to tell immediately something is amiss if the signature verifies to another key, or if the signature fails to verify and gives a &quot;BAD SIGNATURE from TripleDES!&quot; error. This has the effect of being able to reduce the question of security down to two factors: the security of my computer, and the security of yours. <br><br>It&#39;s a bit overkill, but, as you guys may have noticed, senseless overkill is a bit of a pattern with me. <br><br>&gt; -Given that people may be using either a phone or a browser, i<br>&gt; t&#39;s usually better to provide something that can be read on ei<br>&gt; ther. Google Docs work perfectly for this, since they adjust t<br>&gt; o the screen width. Your Permission Request is very difficult <br>&gt; to read on the PC.

Thoth had a suggestion below, so I&#39;ll add another response to theirs, and I&#39;ll address this there. <br><br><br>&gt; -The reason for the character bios being requested at 200 word<br>&gt; s is that you shouldn&#39;t need to put much in them. The purpose <br>&gt; of the bios is to check that you haven&#39;t slipped something Suv<br>&gt; ian into the backstory or powers that doesn&#39;t show up in the w<br>&gt; riting sample. That&#39;s it. It&#39;s not so we get their entire life<br>&gt; story.<br><br>No problem, I&#39;ll try to keep things brief from this point on if asked. <br><br>&gt; -&#39;Because I don’t feel right bullying other people over their <br>&gt; Mary Sues...&#39; This is an immediate warning bell for me. Do you<br>&gt; think the PPC is about bullying people? In your explanation to<br>&gt; Iximaz, you use language such as &#39;taking huge amounts of flak <br>&gt; and ridicule from someone anonymous&#39;, which suggests you kind <br>&gt; of do.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; That isn&#39;t what we do. The PPC community is very clear about t<br>&gt; he distinction between authors and their characters. Comment o<br>&gt; n the characters doing stupid things, but never say a word abo<br>&gt; ut the authors. And that&#39;s not in a &#39;nudge nudge, that Sue is <br>&gt; so badly written she probably lived in her mother&#39;s basement i<br>&gt; n a previous life, NOT TALKING ABOUT THE WRITER hehe&#39; sense - <br>&gt; it&#39;s that we recognise that writing is an art form, and one th<br>&gt; at takes practice. We were all bad writers once, and many of u<br>&gt; s have PPC&#39;d our own stories for it. That doesn&#39;t say anything<br>&gt; about us as people, and if anyone thinks that poking fun at ba<br>&gt; dfics is a stand-in for mocking the authors, I advise them to <br>&gt; think again - several times.<br><br>I understand your concern with the idea of bullying other people over their Mary Sues. I&#39;ve actually followed the PPC for a little bit longer than I have let on up until now. I remember reading an article that Neshomeh had written sometime ago in response to accusations of cyberbullying. If my memory serves it was a response to a certain &quot;Bosette&quot; that had argued that writing Mary Sues was empowering to women. I recall it being from maybe around mid 2010 originally although I know that it may have been brought up a lot, since it&#39;s appeared several times sense. <br><br>With this in mind: I want to stress that I intend to homebrew my own badfic simply because I want to be able to err on the side of caution. This way, there can be **no possible way** I could ever be construed as having been engaging in cyberbullying, since there would be no perceptible target, except a fictional author, that doesn&#39;t exist. <br><br>It&#39;s overkill, but again, overkill is just in my nature. <br><br><br>&gt; (Also, I realise you&#39;re into the crypto thing, but honestly? I<br>&gt; t&#39;s ridiculously easy to find my name on the internet, but I&#39;d<br>&gt; still be &#39;anonymous to the majority of bad fic authors&#39;. So is<br>&gt; every reviewer on Fanfiction.net. Most people don&#39;t try and fi<br>&gt; nd out who&#39;s &#39;really&#39; talking to them.)<br><br>I tend to be a little bit cautious, that&#39;s all. <br><br>&gt; -Your first agent is a canon character (indeed, the main prota<br>&gt; gonist), albeit in a fiction canon. There go the alarm bells a<br>&gt; gain. Have you read Jasper Fforde&#39;s Jurisfiction books? Becaus<br>&gt; e it seems like your notion of how the world of fiction works <br>&gt; is closer to that than to the PPC&#39;s model. You talk about John<br>&gt; Smith has since sought work as a fictional character in other <br>&gt; venues, but in the PPC multiverse, canon characters don&#39;t get <br>&gt; to wander off when their series ends. They exist in closed uni<br>&gt; verses - &#39;realised&#39; to a greater or lesser extent, but always <br>&gt; there. They don&#39;t move between them, and they don&#39;t &#39;notice&#39; w<br>&gt; hen new installments come out - that&#39;s just their timeline, fo<br>&gt; r all it&#39;s still being written.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; -Your second agent is also a canon character, and has exactly <br>&gt; the same issues: she exists in a world where she can wander be<br>&gt; tween fiction at will, and is &#39;out of work&#39; since her show&#39;s c<br>&gt; ancellation.<br><br>I have actually not read Jurisfiction! I will have to. <br><br>I wanted to take the metafiction approach since I believed that taking a much more bold-facedly meta approach would allow for characters to also be show more in the way of self-awareness. It would make breaking the fourth wall a little bit easier, and I thought that having been from failed continuities themselves could also give them some idea of what happens when the creative process slides downhill. I&#39;ve noticed that several other writers use redeemed or atoning Sues as agents and thought to take it to something of a next step. If this is incompatible with the current continuity though, I understand and will take this into account. <br><br>&gt; -You also talk about &#39;a character shield which is powered by t<br>&gt; wo AAA batteries... protects a character from all harm... only<br>&gt; for the hero designated by the writers&#39;. Again, this assumes a<br>&gt; completely different worldview than that used by the PPC: one <br>&gt; in which writers wander into their fiction, and are known by t<br>&gt; heir creations (and can issue technology to an entire genre, s<br>&gt; omehow). I&#39;ll admit it&#39;s an amusing idea, and would work pefec<br>&gt; tly in Jurisfiction, but not in the PPC.<br><br>One of my major sources of inspiration for this was *The Last Action Hero.* The idea of an Action Hero and his Archnemesis winding up in the real world, where the rules aren&#39;t decided by the pen of the author and the Hero isn&#39;t going to triumph all the time just because of authorial fiat really appealed to me. I thought the same could be applied to a Mary Sue. After all, I feel that John Smith himself would, in his home continuity, be walking a very fine line himself. There are after all, many similarities between an Action Movie Hero, and a Mary Sue. <br><br>&gt; -You wrote over 500 words on their car. Here is what you actua<br>&gt; lly needed to write: &#39;Instead of a normal Response Centre, Joh<br>&gt; n and Ayumi use an old car, to make them more like a buddy cop<br>&gt; movie&#39;. That&#39;s what I mean by overkill. :)<br><br>Sure. <br><br>&gt; -If your agents are in the Department of Floaters, their depar<br>&gt; tment head is the Floating Hyacinth, who isn&#39;t prone to yellin<br>&gt; g. &#39;the trope of an angry, yelling police chief&#39; may well be c<br>&gt; ommon, but it would be a big change to the PPC canon.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; -The Department of Floaters isn&#39;t just about what canon they w<br>&gt; ork in - it&#39;s about what type of missions they tackle. From th<br>&gt; e All-Purpose Department wiki page:<br>&gt; <br>&gt; The All-Purpose Department contains agents who are willing to <br>&gt; work in only one fandom but accept all types of missions. Com<br>&gt; pare to the Department of Floaters, whose agents may work in <br>&gt; any fandom and take any type of mission, and the DMS and DBS&#39;<br>&gt; s Freelance Divisions, whose agents may work in any fandom but<br>&gt; only do assassinations or exorcisms, respectively.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; So if you&#39;re only intending to tackle Mary-Sues, pop them in <br>&gt; DMS-Freelance instead.<br><br>Will do!<br><br>&gt; -Surprisingly, I have no problem with the idea of a portalling<br>&gt; car. I&#39;m not sure what the &#39;real&#39; effect of the travel montage<br>&gt; is, though - what do John and Ayumi actually experience? Do th<br>&gt; ey sit in the car and watch it play out on the screen? Do they<br>&gt; get teleported from scene to scene?<br><br>The effects of travel montages and what the characters experience actually were a bit of a joke even before I thought of this series. For instance, if the travel montage is meant to represent a long period of time where the characters are boarding a flight, then why do they pick up the conversation that they were having before the trip back up immediatey from where they left off the moment they get off the plane or the montage ends? My guess is that when that happens, travel montages are very nearly instant to the characters, or take *exactly* the same time they take us, the audience, to watch them occur! <br><br>&gt; -&#39;Typical for police dramas, both Ayumi and John carry badges.<br>&gt; &#39; Uh... what canon are you writing for, again? Because it does<br>&gt; n&#39;t sound like you want to write for the PPC at all.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; -I&#39;m looking through the &#39;writing sample&#39;, and... you&#39;re not w<br>&gt; riting the PPC. You don&#39;t mention anything from the PPC. Other<br>&gt; than &#39;killing badfic&#39;, your story has nothing to do with the P<br>&gt; PC.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; So... good news! To write a buddy cop show about John and Ayum<br>&gt; i, badfic police extraordinaire, their quirky old car, and the<br>&gt; ir shouty Chief who wants Their Badges And Guns You&#39;re Off The<br>&gt; Case, you don&#39;t need Permission! :D You can write it, post it <br>&gt; somewhere (I recommend fanfiction.net, though some prefer Arch<br>&gt; ive of Our Own), and let people read it! I&#39;m sure there are pe<br>&gt; ople here in the PPC who&#39;d love to beta it for you - folks who<br>&gt; se interests include the intersection of anime and action - an<br>&gt; d we&#39;d be happy for you to plug it on the Board when it&#39;s up s<br>&gt; o we can take a look.<br><br>If you guys are going to be OK with me publishing here, I&#39;d really like to, PPC spinoff or not. If need be, I&#39;ll preface my stuff with a disclaimer stating that Watanabe &amp; Smith is not a part of PPC Continuity, so that way there can be no confusion at all. After all, if I&#39;ve got a disclaimer stating that the stunt driving that I haven&#39;t written yet isn&#39;t realistic there&#39;s always room for more disclaimers or notes. <br><br>&gt; But it&#39;s not a PPC story, so it doesn&#39;t need PPC Permission. C<br>&gt; ase... closed.<br><br>Alright, I&#39;ll bear that in mind.<br><br>Thank you very much. I&#39;ll get to work immediately. <br><br>~3DES.<br><br><br><br><br>Footnote 1: A determined troll could create a counterfeit key, upload it to the keyserver, sign messages with it, present the counterfeit key to you guys as the real one, and if nobody bothers to check the signatures, then they might be able to pass off as me to someone who doesn&#39;t check the signatures. An even more determined attacker might upload thousands of counterfeit keys to the keyserver all with the identity &quot;TripleDES&quot; on them as a crude form of a denial-of-service attack. A very, VERY determined attacker could hijack the DNS (not usually something I would trust your average pissed off fanficcer to be capable of doing, but it&#39;s not hard since DNS wasn&#39;t ever meant to be secure) when you attempt to look back and see if the signing key has changed and verify it against the original fingerprint I posted with messages of their own, which would be able to trick anyone who hadn&#39;t obtained my genuine, original public key. An adversary with state-level resources could spend a lot of computing power and time to generate a key that produces a fingerprint collision since PGP uses SHA-1 for the key fingerprints, but my threat model doesn&#39;t at this moment account for that kind of an attack. Until a sufficiently powerful computer that can efficiently solve the elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem or my computer&#39;s cryptographically secure random number generator suffers a nonce collision since I use ECDSA which consumes randomness to make each signature, I do not believe crypto, Tor, or protocols to be the weak link in my own security. <br><br>-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----<br><br>iLUEARMKAB0WIQTfllUBtaeNnRzzfmVK3+74uImA+wUCWe6cYQAKCRBK3+74uImA<br>+0zjAgCpFJkp1TCWQs+fsctG5QHdFBTSK6yQwe4grHs2dHx0ib66FdbToxnglS4w<br>XpgmUX3HTLOZD3VB7+Xk1fPhwESLAf9buuVnGbA3EvycsLPfFJtNJesE49IhmYbL<br>tUog5HFjXRWlhPrcHIPHqfWcBGWRSXHGh1ek1aTpK/iiyygL40SP<br>=EUWL<br>-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----<br></p>

Or rather, a suggestion.<br><br>hS suggests Google Docs for 3DES&#39;s Permission prompt and other writing. Unfortunately, I doubt that 3DES will find this acceptable. So I&#39;m here to suggest some alternative formats that might be more acceptable. And yes, just to get this out of the way, all of these formats are mutable.

            <p>... And I just found the answer to the question I was going to ask, which is how much storage space you get with a free account. <a href="https://blog.neocities.org/blog/2017/03/26/huge-space-increase.html">The answer appears to be 1G</a>, which is bloody phenomenal compared to the 20Mb I&#39;ve got over on Tripod. I haven&#39;t nearly filled that yet, thanks in part to carefully managing how many images I actually store there, but dang, not having to even think about it would be nice!<br><br>I might just move—the Lost Tales, at least, and maybe my own stuff, too. It won&#39;t be soon, because I don&#39;t have time right now, but I know the ads on Tripod are an issue for people without adblock, and it&#39;s been a long time since I could happily recommend the service to anyone else.<br><br>I reckon they&#39;re better than Webs, too.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----<br>Hash: SHA512<br><br>Hi Twistedwindowpane,<br><br>No, I&#39;m definitely not trying to hack you! I just use the Tor anonymizing network for my own protection against doxxing and also for my own privacy, especially because this board publicly displays the IP address of everyone who posts on it. <br><br>Because this board doesn&#39;t have SSL or TLS or any sort of security, I don&#39;t want someone to go around posing as me, which is why I also PGP-sign my messages. The risk is especially great for me, because for most people that don&#39;t have large budgets and the powers of a court subpoena (and in some cases, even for those that do), it is very difficult to tell one Tor user from another. <br><br>I don&#39;t want to end up getting kicked out from the PPC just because somebody else decided to download Tor Browser, type &quot;TripleDES&quot; into the Author: field, and throw around provocative and insulting comments to the community. Or, more likely because someone else trolls or spams the board again using Tor to mask their identity. <br><br>Tomash has an excellent writeup on Public Key signatures here, on this very board.<br><a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?id=199610;article=295080;search_term=PGP"><a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?id=199610;article=295080;search_term=PGP">http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?id=199610;article=295080;search_term=PGP</a></a><br><br>I use a slightly different algorithm than he does (he uses RSA-4096 and SHA-256, I use Brainpool P-512r1 and SHA-512) so my signatures appear different than his do, but otherwise, they achieve the same goal. Provided you have my real, genuine key, it authenticates me to you, ensures that if anyone tampers with the message I write, it can be detected and also, that I can&#39;t &#39;take back&#39; or repudiate what I sign at a later date. Of course, the hard part then, is that you have to be sure you have the real key that belongs to the real me, and not a counterfeit one that&#39;s been issued in my name! <br><br><br>Moving back on topic, yes, I do try very hard. I&#39;ll see what comes out of this. I don&#39;t intend on leaving unless you guys feel that you&#39;re no longer comfortable having me around or vice versa, so I hope to stick around. <br>-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----<br><br>iLUEARMKAB0WIQTfllUBtaeNnRzzfmVK3+74uImA+wUCWe1XpwAKCRBK3+74uImA<br>+2TBAgCBYmlgMn28wCnbUeXyuxzeAIXOHukg+dbdSQ3ZF9Ihu6sph6sMGGKUA3y1<br>RdF4WSrcYP/DHuETLzfBPOig0cNvAgCpG+Un8kk11ArZgBfLujhoxezmgiE+kIBS<br>rL45a7JNkywvL4ikOsQQMuIV40fZpfEIrngTLeFKDT3/toAUYR/e<br>=BIdU<br>-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----<br></p>

            <p>I looked in the PDF, and I&#39;m pretty sure that the reason it&#39;s so big is that 3DES is using a very large font size. Seriously: I&#39;m reading this on my phone, and I never had to zoom in on the text at all.<br><br>As for concerns about the file... By default it will open in a PDF.js window embedded in the webpage 3DES linked you to. So for it to damage your computer, it would not only have to find an exploit in PDF.js, it would also have to break your browser&#39;s sandbox.<br><br>TL;DR, the PDF is safe to read on the webpage. If you&#39;re really paranoid, I can check the PDF sources, but I find it unlikely that there is any danger there whatsoever.</p>

            <p>-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----<br>Hash: SHA512<br><br>Hi Huinesoron,<br><br>For convenience, I&#39;ve used a template that is optimized to display on E-book readers and mobile devices. This meant using a small page size with an oversized typeface, as well as a font that offered generous spacing between characters to avoid the characters intersecting when viewed on small or dimly lit screens. I also was generous with the whitespace for pagebreaks and headers to allow for easier navigation within the document file. As a result, each page only has a relatively small amount of text, compared to what you would find on a letter sized page with a more efficient typeface. I also felt that using PDF would be the best choice rather than .epub, since the NextCloud server that I use offers an integrated PDF viewer. This would also ensure that what I saw on my preview would be true to what anyone else saw on theirs.<br><br>Some of the content as well has to do with the background of why I made the choices I did when designing the characters, as well as the historical basis in which I made the selections for them. This is because of the genre and aesthetic I&#39;ve been trying to achieve, since Watanabe &amp; Smith is designed to be a homage to a few of the &quot;Buddy Cop&quot; TV shows of the 1970s to the 1980s. This is not essential to the story itself, and is more for future reference and understanding where I plan to go with the series in the future. <br>-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----<br><br>iLUEARMKAB0WIQTfllUBtaeNnRzzfmVK3+74uImA+wUCWe0TeQAKCRBK3+74uImA<br>+4suAgCEQ4gYZEssfivdYWXxB9jH0WqrsZGpFlQMFCpvxf7eEmQU2U+O9ef8/CAg<br>VHXjwztI+QqJgDS+Cb5opAJHFCChAf9J8GklY2zP5cLBGFdRchonRvWYz9y/g3Do<br>EvORhgSTlax0wIBVb2q4J6ZTWlDRZgzyoG8gsn4cHhypUjLLkQPs<br>=OFU6<br>-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----<br></p>

            <p>-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----<br>Hash: SHA512<br><br>Hello Ix,<br><br>As per the PPC Wiki entry, I looked at the following under &quot;What to include in a Permission Request.&quot; <br><br>&gt;     Brief bios of your agents, about 200 words minimum (though<br>&gt; up to ~400 is okay). This is so the Permission Givers can chec<br>&gt; k that they&#39;re not blatant Sues or Stus. Please touch on:<br>&gt; Basic info - Name, species, age, sex/gender, home continuum, e<br>&gt; tc.<br><br>Done. John Smith&#39;s home continuity is on page 13 of the PDF, Ayumi&#39;s is on page 20 of the PDF, and I&#39;ve included hyperlinks to the different sections to make it easy to navigate with the bookmarks. The Table of Contents is clickable and the PDF is bookmarked. I&#39;ve included a lot of information about them and how they came to be kicked out of or left their home continuities, so that you can draw your own conclusions.<br><br>I understand I may have gone over budget in word count, but I also felt it was important to explain why as well as some of the background of why I made the choices I did, since this is a homage to a particular genre, and those genres are products of their time. For example, I didn&#39;t just pick the Dodge Monaco because it was a cool car (although I personally find the Dodge Monaco a VERY cool automobile!), but because it was an icon of the California Highway Patrol during the 1970s. <br><br>&gt;        Appearance - What they look like and other physical tra<br>&gt; its.<br><br>Done. They are both described in simile (typical for hard-boiled fiction) on Page 39 of the PDF, in-fic. Ayumi is described in a bit more detail in her own respective section. I realize now there is a mistake on one of the pages that I should have read over, on Page 39 of the PDF it should read &quot;Even a hard-boiled private eye monologue that talked like a simile would&#39;ve resorted *TO* florid prose.&quot; D&#39;oh! I&#39;ll fix that next release, sorry about that. <br><br>&gt;        Personality - Basic demeanor, outlook, habits, likes an<br>&gt; d dislikes, etc.<br>&gt;        History - Background information such as where they com<br>&gt; e from, how they joined the PPC, family relations, important f<br>&gt; ormative experiences, etc. The character&#39;s backstory should in<br>&gt; form their personality and appearancein particular, personalit<br>&gt; y traits and abilities should be justified by the history.<br><br>Done and done. The entirety of how they left their respective home continuities is described in great detail. For formative experiences, Ayumi has quite a number of them between being able to finally break out of her role that her authors locked her into for four seasons of the same show, and John Smith has watched his movie career collapse. More of their actual behaviour and chemistry together is shown in the first chapter of the story, so I hope that that should demonstrate things a bit more. <br><br>&gt;        Any other traits or abilities we should know about.<br><br>Done. Each of the bios includes a trivia section which includes the types of (quirky) powers that they have. I tried to avoid going for standard powers (super speed, invincibility, etc), and simply go for powers that made sense in meta, such as Ayumi creating letters at her feet in a badly rendered font whenever she speaks Japanese because of the quality of the dub, and those badly rendered fonts being &#39;very sharp&#39; because they were done in poor quality freeware. <br><br>&gt;        The department you intend to place them in. A complete <br>&gt; list of existing departments can be found here. <br><br>Done. First line on Page 24 of the PDF, the Department of Floaters. I&#39;ve also made a shoutout to the DoSAT. The avoidance of using Portal Technology is because I felt it would be more fitting to use a travel montage, which were also staples of action adventure films of yesteryear, and can be made to work with the rule of funny. Just think about all the trouble that characters could get into as they try to trace a line across a map, or maybe there is some potential to play it for drama when they realize they need to get somewhere in a hurry but can&#39;t just throw a montage down out of nowhere!<br><br>&gt;    A link to the writing samples you created or the samples th<br>&gt; emselves copied directly into your post. We want to see how we<br>&gt; ll you write mechanically, and we really want to see whether y<br>&gt; ou can write three-dimensional, entertaining characters in a s<br>&gt; tyle that works for the PPC. <br><br>Done. A writing sample is included starting on Page 31 of the PDF. It is the first chapter of my proposed spinoff. <br><br>&gt; As mentioned above, your samples <br>&gt; should be based on a control prompt and a creative or random p<br>&gt; rompt, discussed in further detail in the Permission Prompt Gu<br>&gt; idelines.<br><br>I used the following two: <br><br>3, 3, Agents are transferred to a new department.<br>5, 3, One agent discloses a secret. <br><br>These are covered in more detail in the story, starting on Page 38 of the PDF. <br><br>&gt;    A link to the badfic you intend to tackle as your first mis<br>&gt; sion, and a sentence or two explaining why it&#39;s bad. This is s<br>&gt; o we can make sure you&#39;ve got an eye for what makes a good mission.<br><br>I&#39;ll actually be writing my own bad fanfiction for this, but I&#39;ve included a short paragraph about what I&#39;ll be doing on Page 10 of the PDF, and how I intend to make it bad. I&#39;m also hoping to finish with an after-action report, as shown by the place holder on page 56 of the PDF. <br><br>I believe (to a given degree, thanks to Tor and other privacy tools, but for security reasons I cannot name them all) that I am anonymous to the majority of bad fic authors. Because of this, I feel like it isn&#39;t my place to criticize them from a safe, comfortable distance behind their backs, especially given that many of these bad fanfiction authors could have written their bad fanfiction when they were younger and have since moved past them. Or they could still be young and impressionable, and taking huge amounts of flak and ridicule from someone anonymous who they can&#39;t trace and can&#39;t explain themselves to isn&#39;t something I&#39;d feel proud of, as someone who has in the past written bad fanfiction, and would feel very upset if someone behind a several layers of crypto-anonymity dragged it back up to make fun of something I let go a long time back. <br><br>This is why I&#39;ll be writing my own bad fanfiction, so it&#39;s something even bad fanfiction authors would be able to laugh at, and possibly, maybe even identify with and realize that they may make the same mistakes as well, without being mean-spirited.  <br><br>&gt;    The names of your beta reader or readers. <br><br>I&#39;d like to get a beta reader, and now that I have the infrastructure set up for it hopefully this should make things much easier. I will definitely list them in future installments. <br><br>I hope that this may clarify things somewhat. Please let me know if you have any other questions or concerns.<br><br>~3DES. <br>-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----<br><br>iLUEARMKAB0WIQTfllUBtaeNnRzzfmVK3+74uImA+wUCWe1KewAKCRBK3+74uImA<br>+zGDAf46YjyXbj6E4KtomXaM2dobRvU0gMtR6GAG/JDTPliXqyPwhOFW5ImfWaiY<br>jAvvjT2duMzY1zMQwMJlQl9RN4dPAf4kmPZYGl0b2ITP0tIQIjW2CFW5fbUNskQJ<br>zOLx6xeWektLdM3OyLMX1XbXXjK0IwjcPcPHzA3yRrQjCrJrMqI5<br>=kSjq<br>-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----<br></p>

            <p>After looking several times on the wiki, there are some things that I&#39;m wondering about that may come into play at some point, and I&#39;m nervous about interpreting things incorrectly.<br><br>-Does a badfic come into &quot;existence&quot; only once it has hit the internet, or can it be similarly entered and killed via portal into a written-on-paper badfic?<br><br>-Is a fic still sporkable if it has been deleted and reposted in its original state? IE, the original author took it down but someone else put it back up and made no changes.<br><br>-Are there rules about returning regularly to one&#39;s home dimension?<br><br>-Is Bleeprin a solid, liquid, or gas? Would it work on the undead?<br><br>-Are any of the devices operated by heat-sensing touch screens?<br><br>-Is it acceptable to write an agent as having been a part of the PPC for a while, even if the character has just been created?<br><br>-How does the killing of a fic affect the Real World outside of Headquarters? Is it purged from existence, non-sentient, or some such?<br><br>-If the above have no clear answer, do I resort to the Laws of Narrative Irony and Comedy?</p>

            <p>&gt;Yes to your first question, though some agents have come from unpublished fanfics, both good and bad. The general agreement seems to be that if your homefic is unpublished, you&#39;ll have one heck of a time trying to get back to it.<br><br>&gt;Yes to your second. <i>My Immortal</i> has long since been deleted from the Pit, but thanks to many, many people rehosting it, I&#39;ll be able to spork it without any problems.<br><br>&gt;Ehhh, kind of to the third. Popping by for a few minutes to say hello to family doesn&#39;t seem to be frowned on, but if you want to stay longer, you need vacation time from the Flowers, and they don&#39;t really like to let agents have time off. And, of course, barring some circumstances, the agents have to keep the PPC a secret.<br><br>&gt;Bleeprin&#39;s been taken in pill form, drank with a large variety of cocktails, smoked in cigarettes... basically, if it&#39;s a food, it can probably be mixed with Bleep. As for who it works on, that&#39;s entirely up to you!<br><br>&gt;They all seem to be operated by buttons of various types. One of my agents is a <i>Twilight</i> vampire, so she&#39;s be in a bit of a pickle if she couldn&#39;t use any of the gear, yeah? :P<br><br>(I&#39;m guessing you&#39;re planning on making an undead agent?)<br><br>&gt;Absolutely! Just make sure to write the character appropriately, and not have them make rookie mistakes. <br><br>&gt;The original fic is still available for reading, but it no longer affects the canon. (Basically, until a fic is killed, it just keeps looping over and over and repeatedly subjects the canons to their torture.)<br><br>If I got anything wrong, someone feel free to correct me. But anyway—hope this helped!</p>

            <p>^That&#39;s actually three pieces of advice up there. Let me explain.<br><br>1/ Write what you know.<br><br>Just because you&#39;re building a magic system/piece of supertech, doesn&#39;t mean it has to be complicated. Brandon Sanderson has already been mentioned, and the Mistborn books are instructive. The magic is: if you have the talent, you eat powdered metal, and get a power from it. The power might be &#39;can pull metal towards you&#39;, or &#39;can soothe emotions&#39;. Very simple, and it doesn&#39;t matter why it works. It just does, and a simple table of metals and powers is all the reference you need to remember it.<br><br>Or, I&#39;ve cited my NaNo before. One piece of tech I have is a momentum-damping field. That&#39;s what it does. Oh, it drops off in strength towards the edge. The physics behind it? Dunno. Not important. I came up with something simple that you and I can both understand from a sentence. It doesn&#39;t have to be complex.<br><br>2/ Know what you write.<br><br>Let&#39;s say you want your magic to be manipulation of fire. I approve! So how can you get a bit more of that detail into it? One word: Wikipedia.<br><br>The Wiki article on fire will give you technical terms to throw around - &#39;oxidation&#39; is a good one. It will tell you about the history of its use (so your fire mages could have existed since it was discovered). It will discuss rituals and cultural beliefs around fire (which might inform your characters - maybe they all worship Prometheus, or perhaps they themselves are worshipped by a culture with a connection to fire). It will give you the science behind it - the fire triangle, for instance - which can create limits on their magic. (Sanderson&#39;s Second Law: limits trump powers.) And if it&#39;s a tricky concept - like you want to use dark energy in your story - try the Simple English Wikipedia to avoid the dense maths that eats the physics pages.<br><br>The more details you pick up, the more you can use them to add depth to your story.<br><br>3/ But seriously, write what you know.<br><br>JRR Tolkien was a linguist. He studied Old English and the cultures in the sagas, and he dealt with poems. Surprise surprise, Middle-earth is centred around poetry, languages, and old-style heroic tales - and it&#39;s better for it, because he knew what it was all about.<br><br>So look at your own interests. Writing, for one! Writing-based magic is surprisingly rare. But maybe you also grow bonsai - great, that means you can talk about the effects of a shrink ray and sound like you know what you&#39;re on about. You enjoy card tricks? Then you can use the idea of patter and misdirection to help your wizards hide in plain sight. You make origami? Great - when you talk about complex crystalline mazes and space-folding wormholes, you&#39;ll have something you can draw on (what&#39;s the difference between a mountain- and valley-folded wormhole? Bam, instant story.)<br><br>You know stuff. You can find stuff out. And you can take the simple and build a story from it. So...<br><br>Write what you know.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>The trick is not to hide to the exposition, it&#39;s to make it enjoyable. Heck, if you&#39;re writing in first person, you can have a character straight-up explain to the audience. The Dresden Files does this all the time, and it might get annoying, but it doesn&#39;t because 1) The exposition is largely kept very brief, and 2) it is absolutely dripping with personality: this isn&#39;t the writer telling you a thing, this is Harry explaining his world.</p>

            <p>The Eddingses loved doing this, using a fake historical account as a prologue. The Belgariad starts with what&#39;s basically a religious story; each book of the Tamuli starts with a scholarly study of the events you&#39;re reading about. Heck, Tolkien does it, too, name-dropping King Elessar in his discussion of the Red Book.<br><br>What they do is to introduce you to the world and its background without having a character say it to another character. If the Prologue can tell us that Middle-earth is &#39;Earth but long ago and with elves&#39;, then Frodo doesn&#39;t need to have a conversation about it with Gandalf. (&quot;Gosh, Gandalf, I do wish you&#39;d tell me that old tale about how the world was created, I always so love to hear it...&quot;)<br><br>Another example is Brandon Sanderson (again!); each of the <i>Mistborn</i> books has false-document quotes at the head of every chapter. They let him feed in the backstory that everyone in the world already knows, while at the same time using it as a storytelling device and subverting it (by casting the setting&#39;s myths as a diary, I seem to recall).<br><br>The trick to doing this successfully is to use your false-document (or any other form of exposition) not <i>just</i> as exposition, but as part of the story. Check out the opening of <i>Serenity</i> (y&#39;know, the <i>Firefly</i> movie), which manages to recap the relevant backstory from the series as part of the introduction of the villain. If you have a mentor to deliver information, make her teaching style relevant to the plot - the <i>Wonder Woman</i> movie gives us its founding myth as a bedtime story for Diana, which builds her relationship with her mother, feeds into her motivations, and - through what she is and isn&#39;t told - helps to establish both conflict and the plot of the film.<br><br>And for the love of all that&#39;s fictional, never do what some comic books do and have your hero yell &quot;I&#39;m trying to use my laser vision to stop you, but your forcefield is making you immune to it -- how?!&quot;. Trust your audience.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I think the best mindset towards exposition is: No exposition. <br><br>Or, to be less hyperbolic, with regards to explaining how things work in your story, you should try and take a very minimalist stance (or, at least, that&#39;s how I do it.) One of the things I&#39;ve found in writing - not just with magic or technology, but writing in general - is that you are essentially trying to get heaps of information into the heads of your readers, without them knowing or feeling like they&#39;re having information shoved into them. <br><br>This is the difference between telling, and showing. In terms of characterisation, you can just say: &#39;Jim Jackson is a very angry man&#39; - you are delivering the information that he is angry, but the readers can see, so obviously, that you are just shoving that fact down their throats. It&#39;s awkward, and takes them out of it. Meanwhile, if you have Jim Jackson get very angry at something, snarl, throw something and go red, the information - that he is a very angry man - is delivered, but so is an actual event in the story. Rather than feeling like they&#39;ve just read an infodump, the reader feels like they&#39;ve simply read an occurrence in the story - which has also had the effect of telling them that Jim Jackson is an angry man. It fits right into the flow of the story, and doesn&#39;t feel awkward. <br><br>It is a similar thing, then, with magic and technology. In essence, you &#39;disguise&#39; information, by weaving it in alongside something else. Remember that all these sorts of rules can be very vague and floaty - it is possible just have a short paragraph explaining how a magic or technology works, so long as it feels like it still has a role in the story beyond just &#39;explaining.&#39; <br><br>I&#39;ve found a lot of times that, if you&#39;re sneaky with it, you can pass off a straight explanation as a character simply thinking of the technology/magic in question, as they look at or approach it or such. Which works even <i>better</i>, then, if you use that to also show their character - like having them think that force fields are cheap and lame, which shows that the world has force fields, that they aren&#39;t rare, and that our character finds them lame and is probably a dope. In doing so, the information is successfully disguised! But that&#39;s, ah, only one example. So long as you get it disguised. <br><br>You also need to consider the relevance of the information you&#39;re delivering - essentially, be on the prowl for unnecessary information that can be removed, and considering what information <i>can&#39;t</i> be removed. <br><br>Going back to the minimalist thing, you will only want to explain things that are actually relevant to the plot and the character - there is no point going on, in detail, about Jim Jackson&#39;s fondness for dolls and motorcycles, if these are irrelevant to the occurrences of the story, both the plot and his character. Even if you show, rather than tell, about his fondness for dolls and motorcycles, it&#39;s still irrelevant. <br><br>Similarly, with magic and technology, you should use its relevance to your story as a basis for the existence of an explanation for it - what would you lose, if you removed the explanation for this technology? Would the story make no sense, would the world make no sense, would a point you want to get across with the story not be there? Does a person reading this <i>need</i> this information, for the story, or world, to feel complete? You should, in essence, consider - very specifically - what it is you want to do with the piece of introduced technology or magic. If you&#39;re not losing anything by removing it, and it&#39;s not doing anything, it&#39;s probably going to be very distracting, and ought to get a <i>chopping</i>. <br><br>Going back to my force field example, above, it is necessary to know about force fields in the world - to explain how they can have their ship defend itself, so that it makes sense when, later on, the force field is used to defend said ship, and to demonstrate that the existence of force fields is a part of this particular world. What you <i>don&#39;t</i> necessarily need to know is how the force field works, or how the voltron crystals that make up its motor are made out of diamondised grapium that are flux capacitated to the nth dimension, or that it it was the Jim Jackson and Co company that built it. These pieces of information are not relevant to the story, world, or plot. <br><br>But!<br><br>You <i>will</i> need to demonstrate that information if, for example, the main character deals in diamondised grapium and it&#39;s a big part of the plot, or if, for example, you wanted to make some sort of statement mocking big corporations, and mention the shoddy job Jim Jackson and Co did in building the force field, or so on, so forth. <br><br>So, er, there you have it, I guess! If you want to have exposition, you ought to consider, essentially, how you deliver it, and what you are delivering (and what doesn&#39;t need to be delivered.) Explain only what is precisely necessary, and make sure it never feels like it&#39;s only an explanation. <br><br>This, of course, is all just how <i>I</i> write, and is all guidelines, and I&#39;m sure other people may think differently, and I&#39;m sure there will be cases where you&#39;ll be entirely within the right mind to go against these guidelines. So long as you know what you&#39;re doing, and why, and all!</p>

            <p><br>Well, there are couple of ways this could happen. <br><br>If you have an inexperienced protagonist, or inexperienced character in general, you can probably have a mentor explain the system to said character. For example, much of what is said about chakra usage in Naruto comes from Naruto&#39;s various mentors explaining different aspects of chakra usage. This appears natural since a teacher has to explain things to a student in order for the student to learn. <br><br>Another way would be to drop some hints here and there and have the audience connect the dots. This can only be done if there was previous explanations on the basics of the world concerning the hints. For example, a user of a mangekyou sharingan would gradually go blind through extended usage. However, Obito used his mangekyou sharingan a lot and isn&#39;t blind. The answer widely accepted by the fanbase is that because the right side of his body is made of the cells of Senju Hashirama, his eye is constantly being healed. Fans came to this conclusion because it has constantly been stated and shown that the cells of Senju Hashirama has remarkable regenerative properties, hence, the fans connected the dots and came to this conclusion despite no offcial answer being given.<br><br>If there is fighting going on, some minor exposition can be given by showing the thoughts of a character. It could be anything from strategizing or analyzing an opponent&#39;s techniques. For example, when Saber was hit by Gae Bolg on Fate stay night, her thoughts were shown to the audience as she tries to figure put exactly what happened. &quot;No, that was a reversal of cause and effect.&quot; From this, the audience learned what Gae Bolg does from Saber analyzing it.<br><br>Also, sometimes exposition dumps can&#39;t be avoided, especially for really complicated universes such as Nasuverse. In this case you can &quot;show and tell&quot;; show what is happening, but incorporate some exposition into the description.<br><br>Rough summary:<br>-use training scenes.<br>-make the audience play detective.<br>-have a character analyze their opponent&#39;s powers.<br>-sometimes you just have to use information dumps.</p>

            <p>However, if you&#39;re going to have magic/tech/... (let&#39;s call it &quot;shiny stuff&quot; since a catch-all term can&#39;t hurt) be important to the plot, then (thank you chat for pointing me at this a while back) <a href="https://brandonsanderson.com/sandersons-first-law/">Sanderson&#39;s first law</a> applies rather heavily. That is, I need to understand the general ideas of what the shiny stuff can do, and rather importantly, what it can&#39;t do. It&#39;s also pretty annoying if the ways the various shiny things interact with each other don&#39;t make sense.<br><br>So, suppose you&#39;ve got vampires running around in your &#39;verse, and they&#39;ve got the  &quot;no reflection&quot; thing. It&#39;s not all that important that the story go into the details of how/why that works. (Like, it&#39;d possibly be nice, but it&#39;s not required). But it&#39;s important to at least consider how that fits in with the modern world. Is it <i>only</i> reflections? Or is it, for example, a more general &quot;humans can&#39;t see images of vampires&quot; thing? And, in the case of the latter, it would probably make sense to have a company selling vampire-detecting programs (after all, they&#39;re not &quot;human&quot; or anything close, unless they are). Whichever you pick, you just need a line or two that somehow establishes how the power goes and doesn&#39;t go, preferably before it becomes super-plot relevant.<br><br>Anyhow, this has been a ramble.<br><br>- Tomash</p>

            <p><a href="https://huinesoron.livejournal.com/149131.html">My NaNo last year</a> both succeeds and fails at this: a chunk of the plot is about figuring out what this new piece of technology can do, and I then make use of the details to make the finale work. (Being NaNo, obviously it&#39;s still pulling things out of nowhere at the last minute...)<br><br>Sanderson discusses Tolkien, and I think the tale of Beren and Luthien is a useful example of &#39;hard&#39; magic. Luthien shows off her key powers - enthralling people with song (to Beren), shapeshifting (lengthening her hair), and bringing sleep (with the nightcloak) before she even leaves Doriath; she then proceeds to use those three powers pretty much exclusively through the rest of the story. Nargothrond? Put it to sleep. Tol Sirion? Knock Sauron out a bit with her cloak (then borrow <i>his</i> magic for the rest). Entering Angband? Shapeshift into a vampire and put the Wolf to sleep. Stealing a Silmaril? Enthrall Morgoth with song and put him to sleep. Then we have some generic healing (which she already did for Beren after rescuing him), and... nothing else until she&#39;s enthralling Mandos with her song.<br><br>If we didn&#39;t know that Luthien&#39;s song was captivating, her using it to overcome Morgoth would be a weak resolution of the plot (especially if we also didn&#39;t have the duel between Finrod and Sauron to look at). But Tolkien introduced it early, used it repeatedly, and gave it a firm place as a part of the magic system.<br><br>Contrast with Gandalf, whose powers are (as Sanderson says) very loose. He can fight stuff. ... yep, that&#39;s about it. And the biggest things he pulls off with that? Knocking a Balrog off a bridge, making an already-defeated Saruman a bit weaker, and rescuing Faramir from the Nazgul. The plot is never continued by &#39;oh, btw, Gandalf is strong enough to just beat this&#39;.<br><br>~<br><br>The one place I disagree with Tomash is &#39;you just need a line or two that somehow establishes how the power goes and doesn&#39;t go, preferably before it becomes super-plot relevant&#39;. That&#39;s Tell, Don&#39;t Show right there. ^_~ Far better would be for us to <i>see</i> how it works. In a movie, you might demonstrate that vampires don&#39;t appear in images by cutting from them robbing a museum (say) to a shot on the security monitor of the exhibits moving by themselves. In a book, you could clue it with your human character noticing that there&#39;s no photos of Secret Leah Vampir in her flat, for instance. It doesn&#39;t have to be explicitly stated with a waving flag; you can allow your audience the satisfaction of piecing it together.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>In general, it&#39;s better to show than tell, and figuring out how some part of the universe works from the story is a thing that can be pretty fun for the audience (and so make a better story).<br><br>There&#39;s, however, the potential to show too much and bog down the story with setup, I&#39;d think.

            <p>The babble are your notes to guide your story. You should only show them if in the case of classes or researches. Even then, keep it to a minimum.<br><br>Magic is as what you want it to be. Contract-based, mana-based, spell-based, knock yourself out. Read how others make their magic systems. Tolkien have it as more of God&#39;s Will. Nasu have it dwindle, but can be investigated scientifically. Rowling simply make hers spell-based. One writer make the the magic require the same amount of energy as doing it mechanically, but allows the source to come from other places. The only rule you have to obey is to be consistent.<br><br>As for technology, just read on the articles in science magazines of Facebook pages. Be imaginative, no one knew how smartphones can do video calls twenty years ago, but the idea is as common back then as now. You do have to ground it to reality, as well as consider how it will affect and be affected by the magic in your world.<br><br>You are a writer, and thus you are to some extent a world-builder. Craft the magic and technology as you need. Use it to enliven your story.</p>

Or what interesting little tidbit have you discovered to put into the Not News category?<br><br>My contribution to this is that the newest Wolfenstein game was released on Friday! Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus is a sequel to Wolfenstein: The New Order, which came out back in 2014 and is about what might happen to our friend BJ Blazkowicz if we slipped up and lost World War II. Apparently, a Nazi takeover would involve flipping awesome giant robots. Oh well, none of the games in the Wolfenstein franchise have ever been 100% realistic, and that&#39;s what kinda sets them apart. Find out more at the first link below my signature.<br><br>Oh, and another thing from the world of gaming: Minecraft got another update a little while ago. I don&#39;t know exactly when, but I&#39;ve tried it out and it&#39;s pretty dang cool! We now have:<br>- Tamable bird pets that sit on your shoulder and look adorable!<br>- Concrete...?<br>- Glazed Terra Cotta blocks! These are by far my favorite thing in the update, because they have the coolest designs and work really well if you want tiled floors!<br>- Colored beds! Finally!<br>- The Observer, an interesting Redstone-powered block with a poker face, that detects updates in the data of nearby blocks.<br>- New look for the achievements menu and new achievements!<br>- Minecraft <i>finally</i> takes a hint from Terraria (and from one of its own most popular mods) by giving users the crafting recipes for items they&#39;ve picked up for the first time and letting them reference them later!<br>- There may be other things - I can&#39;t get a hold of the Minecraft Wiki pages that contain info about the update. I can, however, get a hold of the link itself, and that will also be posted underneath my signature.<br><br>Back to the main point of this post. Share your news! I&#39;d love to hear it!<br><br>-Twistey<br>------<br>Wolfenstein The New Colossus: <a href="http://wolfenstein.wikia.com/wiki/Wolfenstein_II:_The_New_Colossus"><a href="http://wolfenstein.wikia.com/wiki/Wolfenstein_II:_The_New_Colossus">http://wolfenstein.wikia.com/wiki/Wolfenstein_II:_The_New_Colossus</a></a><br>Minecraft update: <a href="https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/1.12"><a href="https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/1.12">https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/1.12</a></a></p>

            <p>As for why... well, for one, the news has been super depressing these last couple of months. For two, once we were out of the summer, Fandom News died down a bit. And for three, it wasn&#39;t really doing what I wanted it to do. It didn&#39;t spark discussion - just had people posting unrelated posts at each other.<br><br>Which is all well and good, but &#39;rambling discussion and debate&#39; was what I was aiming at. ;) So I figured I&#39;d let us drop back to free-form news posting.<br><br>Now, Minecraft! I&#39;ve been playing Minecraft since... let&#39;s see... the addition of flowers. ^_^ My very first world featured a glass tower with flowers planted on the corners, which actually worked until a couple of updates down the line flowers could only be placed on glass. And don&#39;t get me started on my lovely shrubbery that suddenly turned into a forest...!<br><br>I also had a wooden lava-duct, and made use of the probably-bug where dropping sand into lava or water raised a cube of the liquid to the height you dropped it from. And this was in the days of infinitely-spreading liquids... yeah, one time I deliberately flooded the whole world just for fun.<br><br>(&#39;The whole world&#39; being one of the old Creative squares, of course. I remember scoffing at the idea when InfDev came out...)<br><br>Okay, so new stuff. The terracotta blocks are very pretty, but I&#39;ve not managed to figure out how to get them to tile properly. Several of them have quarter-circles on them, but these have a distressing tendency to not form into full circles.<br><br>I also really like the llamas, which are actually from 1.11, but have the same &#39;pretty colours&#39; thing as the terracotta, with the blankets. Hmm... llama farm with terracotta floor to match the blanket colours? Sounds like a thought...<br><br>The Wiki page for 1.12 is <a href="https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/1.12">here</a>. The big thing you&#39;ve not mentioned is the Illusioner, which is a new mob that... apparently doesn&#39;t naturally spawn? How weird.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>They get placed in whichever direction you&#39;re facing (I don&#39;t know about the others, but Light Gray has the partial circle appear in the top-right corner from the player&#39;s perspective, I think.)<br><br>Is there a spawn egg for the Illusioner? I don&#39;t think I saw one, but I&#39;m wondering what exactly it does.<br><br>Interesting little detail, by the way: The achievement for killing the Ender Dragon is now called &quot;Free the End,&quot; which means the player now has a reason to kill it, instead of just &quot;because I can.&quot; (I like dragons :3) I have yet to figure out, however, why the player is supposed to summon the Wither if it&#39;s just going to cause so much damage and you&#39;re just going to kill it anyway. Also, if the dragon is evil and its egg is &quot;The Next Generation&quot;, why do you want the egg? Bit weird but it&#39;s progress.<br><br>-Twistey</p>

            <p>For the most part, anyway. I don&#39;t draw them, but I&#39;ve gotten decent at scrounging up clipart in similar styles and modifying it in the GIMP as needed. Lately I have traced over actual photos to get something that looks right for a couple, but since I&#39;ve only got a laptop touch pad to work with, it&#39;s tricky.<br><br>Is there one missing that you&#39;d particularly like to have?
