            <p>Why hello there Kura, as I see you have decided to call yourself, from looking at the rest of this thread. I&#39;m Twistey, a lightly-used-bie with too many writing ideas. I write both fanfic and original stuff, and I tend to study deeply into what makes a story good. I&#39;m in way too many fandoms (even some obscure ones).<br><br>Anyway, enough about me, how about you? It seems you were recruited (I think?) and have a fursona (fine by me!), but what other stuff are you interested in? What type of fandoms are you into? Got any original worlds? What do you plan to focus on while you&#39;re here (both in terms of sporking vs MST and in terms of what types of badfic you want to cover)? And do you have any agent ideas that I could evaluate? I&#39;d love to know more! :D<br><br>Finally, for your newbie gift, here&#39;s something I haven&#39;t given anyone yet, from one of the less serious fandoms I have. It&#39;s a toolkit with a set of knives and other tools designed to look like every existing blade in Fruit Ninja, one for each. Some of them even glow and/or make sounds when you swing them around, thanks to the glory of electronics and motion sensors. Use them wisely, for your virtual self or your agents!<br><br>Anyway, it&#39;s nice to meet you! Hope you have a great time here and welcome to the PPC!<br><br>-Twistey</p>

            <p>Since the holiday rush has slowed down for a moment, I&#39;m back to reply to things.<br><br>I was more invited than recruited, but that may be more of a point of view difference. I do indeed have a fursona, in addition to a few semi-character-blips that need some fleshing out before I share them. I&#39;ll refrain from describing them for the time being.<br><br>My fandoms were listed broad strokes in another posting, but I&#39;ll try and focus on a different part of my range here. The general rules are that I prefer works that are some flavor of fantasy, and try to keep myself from getting too narrow in my choices.<br><br>Video games have been on my list since I found out what a fandom is, with RPGs being the most prominent genre of them, and a few arcade style fighters as more recent additions. The Persona series will likely see some focus.<br><br>My enjoyment of tabletop games is more for settings and some light homebrew, though that may just be because I have difficulty in finding groups to play them with. I keep a hefty pile of sourcebooks regardless. Exalted is one of my personal favorites, though it&#39;s somewhat obscure, and if there is Suefic of it out there, I&#39;ve yet to find it. (Admittedly, fics are rare for tabletop RPGs in general.) Chuubo&#39;s Marvelous Wish-Granting Engine is a relatively new one I enjoy as well. Both are over the top settings with a relatively high power level, but in very different flavors.<br><br>In Exalted, the epic scale is often balanced by the title Exalts still being humans, with actual emotions and motivations. There&#39;s also a running theme of &#39;You could, but should you really?&#39;, for a cannon example, you could save a flooded village by killing the relevant river spirit, but if you do, the river might dry up completely, leaving the village you meant to save with a drought to deal with. <br><br>Meanwhile, in Chuubo&#39;s, the focus is on a more comedic, slice of life experience, though serious moments are still possible. You may go to school with a sun goddess, or have your heart pulled out to turn the rest of you into a giant robot as part of a plan to break out of detention, but it&#39;s no big deal, just part of life for an ordinary high school student in Town. Something I particularly enjoy about it is that the system actaully rewards staying in character, developing slowly over the course of personal narrative arcs, and being descriptive about your character&#39;s actions and environment.<br><br>Wall of text aside, I suppose MST-ing would be more my focus, but I realy can&#39;t be sure until I give it a try. Crossovers are of interest, as well as the classic Mary Sue hunting I came here for. I&#39;d rather do more research before committing to any agent ideas. I&#39;ve had at least one semi-original world, but it was mainly for the sake of a forum game, and never got much described in detail beyond a city or two.<br><br>Thank you for the gift, and I hope to see you around while I stay at the board.</p>

            <p>RPGs and tabletop games are a good combination. I myself am trying to get into Dungeons and Dragons, having been spurred by a local performance of &quot;She Kills Monsters&quot;. The tabletop RPGs you&#39;ve mentioned sound pretty cool and fun to play (I&#39;m working on possibly creating one of my own similar to Chuubo&#39;s, except it&#39;s less &quot;haha, all of this is totally normal&quot; and more like &quot;wait, D&amp;D monsters aren&#39;t supposed to exist in the real world, but now they suddenly just showed up! What even! AHHH!&quot;). Chuubo&#39;s sounds pretty funny, I&#39;ll look it up.<br><br>*One Googling session and bookmarked page later...*<br><br>Alright, that looks like some good fun! Maybe you could talk a bit about it to the rest of the Boarders and see what they all think of it - who knows, you might end up starting something up here!<br><br>-Twistey</p>

            <p>To put some worries aside, I doubt anyone will look at your past. But, I gotta say, purple and gold go great together, and IIRC, we need more people with some fashion sense. If you want a webcomic recommendation, there&#39;s this cute little comic called Spacetrawler 4. <a href="https://www.baldwinpage.com/spacetrawler/2010/01/01/spacetrawler-4/"><a href="https://www.baldwinpage.com/spacetrawler/2010/01/01/spacetrawler-4/">https://www.baldwinpage.com/spacetrawler/2010/01/01/spacetrawler-4/</a></a> (Fair warning, this contains NSFW language, and some implied content.)<br><br>A guy named Larfen originally linked it to me, and I found I really liked it. It&#39;s about space. And a slave uprising! And technology. It&#39;s cool and I&#39;m a huge fan of it.</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve had a few names on different forums, and have not yet decided which I should use here. My usual name for online social dealings gives away some of my involvement in the furry fandom, and my others are associated with some role play of dubious quality. I would rather not create an additional name, so for now I default to a simple title.<br><br>But leaving that aside, I&#39;ve spent a few nights since the PPC was recommended to me skimming the wiki already, though a good deal of that has been getting sidetracked by extra Firefox tabs, and have given the constitution a read, but have yet to read the orignal series itself. </p>

            <p>I guess using my fursona&#39;s name here is harmless. And easier to tell apart from other nameless lurkers, so Kura should do as a name for now.<br><br>My fandoms, such as they are, fit the stereotypical nerdy hobbies. Mainly a lose collection of anime and video games I&#39;ve particualy enjoyed (A decently sized list, but the Persona franchise remains high on it.), tabletop games I gather sourcebooks for (Exalted being the most frequently mentioned, though CMWGE has been getting up there.), but seldom ever play, and a few odds and ends. (RWBY, for instance.) To top this off, The Lion King is a guilty pleasure fandom of mine. I would also describe myself as a former fan of Homestuck, and of the Replay Value universe.<br><br>Probably should have started introductions like that, in hindsight. |3</p>

            <p>This all goes back to the <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?id=199610;article=297516;search_term=salazar">Salazar</a> costume drama I suggested last year. You didn&#39;t think I&#39;d just <i>forgotten</i> the concept, did you...?<br><br>-<b>Question 1</b>: Did the Hogwarts founders use wands?<br><br>I know that wands were present in Britain from the BC years (when an Ollivander came over from Rome), but so far as I can tell, there&#39;s no evidence of a Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, or Ravenclaw wand. There <i>is</i> a Slytherin wand, but the Harry Potter Wiki says he made it himself - and from snakewood, which doesn&#39;t seem to be a concept native to the UK (it&#39;s used for Australian acacias and a few New World trees).<br><br>So is it possible that wands were in a fallow period at the time of the Founders? Or perhaps Mr Ollivander lived in the British community in Wales, where Saxon Godric, Viking Helga, and Scottish Rowena wouldn&#39;t go (they being enemies and all). I may be way off-base, but is there even a possibility that their artefacts - the sword, cup, and diadem - served them in the same way that wands do nowadays? I can certainly imagine Godric channeling curses and spells through a sword.<br><br>-<b>Question 2</b>: When was Hogwarts Castle built?<br><br>Obviously Hogwarts was founded in AD 990 or so - but was the castle purpose-built for it? More specifically, I&#39;m wondering if it could be built around the ancestral Ravenclaw home. It&#39;s in Scotland, and it would make more sense to use an existing building if one was available. We know that many modifications would have been made (Ravenclaw&#39;s magic staircases, Slytherin&#39;s cave of evil), but could they all be founded on Rowena&#39;s castle?<br><br>-<b>Question 3</b>: Which spells do <i>not</i> use a Latin incantation?<br><br>Yes, yes - &#39;Avada Kedavra&#39;. That&#39;s where this question came from. Going by the Al-Salazar theory (that Slytherin was a Spanish Muslim of North African descent), I&#39;m wondering if he was the one who introduced the Killing Curse to Britain. It certainly seems his style, and the one non-British Founder bringing the non-Latin curse is pretty tidy. So what else could he have contributed?<br><br>-<b>Question 4</b>: What&#39;s up with Merlin?<br><br>I had this idea that Merlin was the formulator of much of the pseudo-Latin magic - that he fit into the mold of the &#39;Last Roman&#39;, a Roman Empire wizard who settled in Britain during the collapse and gave us the pseudo-Latin structure of magic. Except... according to the wiki, Merlin <i>went to Hogwarts</i>, and therefore lived sometime around the Norman Conquest.<br><br>Which doesn&#39;t make a lot of sense! Merlin is supposed to have been part of King Arthur&#39;s court, but the kings in Britain in the 11th century onwards are very well documented, and there&#39;s no Arthur in there. Also: why do people keep invoking his name if he&#39;s a student of the Founders? Why don&#39;t they curse by Griffindor&#39;s beard and Ravenclaw&#39;s ears instead?<br><br>Two possibilities occur (other than &#39;Rowling mucked up the timeline&#39;, obvs):<br><br>--King Arthur was king of British Wizardry, setting his own government apart from the Norman kings of England. Shades here of the Raven King from <i>Jonathan Strange &amp; Mr Norrell</i>, and the idea of a separate, magical kingdom that the Normans by turns respected and ignored. If we assume the Arthurian legends are similar in wizarding and Muggle tellings, Arthur&#39;s court would have fallen apart in civil war over the question of cooperation with the Muggles (rather than Saxons as the Muggles would have it). When Arthur and Mordred killed each other at Camlann, the wizarding world became subject to the Muggle monarchy. Merlin would be famous as the <i>only</i> Court Wizard in history - a sort of token of a Golden Age that never really existed.<br><br>--There are two Merlins. One was a gifted student in early Hogwarts, feted as the reincarnation/return of the other: the 5th-century wizard companion of the Muggle King Arthur. <i>His</i> story would be basically as we know it: standing against the Saxon invasion, and ultimately overwhelmed.<br><br>Would Merlin then be my post-Roman wizard, who set the magic of the British Isles into Latin so firmly that the Saxons, Vikings, and Normans all ended up adopting it? Or would he be the last stand of <i>British</i> magic, a Druidic (sorry, Ix!) practitioner of a form of the art which would soon be lost in face of the Continental Latin style?<br><br>Wait, that invokes another question:<br><br>-<b>Question 5</b>: Whence Latin?<br><br>We know that Rome was a source of magical knowledge: the first Ollivander was Roman, plus there&#39;s all that Latin. Assuming Latin!Merlin isn&#39;t a thing, can we guess that the claim Ollie 1 came over with the Romans in the 300s BC means he came over with <i>Roman magic</i>? Ie, that the first appearance of Latin spells in Britain was in 382 BC. That at least solves the issue of a 400-year-early Roman invasion.<br><br>But... why would the Saxons and Vikings use the same spells? They drove the British out! Shouldn&#39;t they have kept using the spells of Saxony and Scandinavia? And given that the Saxons in particular defined themselves in <i>opposition</i> to Rome, I don&#39;t feel like that would have been Latin-based.<br><br>I know Latin is the language of scholarship, but the reason for that is the Catholic Church. In which case... is there a possibility that the <i>Church</i> used magic? And that when they came over to convert the Saxons, they also converted them to the &#39;better&#39; Latin magic? Combined with the introduction of wands (not as good as Ollivander&#39;s, obviously, but who&#39;d buy from a Briton), they could probably make a pretty good case.<br><br>I don&#39;t know, maybe I&#39;m completely off-track here. But it definitely feels like the prevalence of Latin among people who have no reason to adopt it needs an explanation.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>The man later called Salazar is born in Al-Andalus around 950, to Moorish parents of a wizarding family. The Caliphate of Cordoba is at this time at the peak of its power - in the late 970s, it will strike north to take a huge chunk of Christian Iberia, nearly unifying the penninsula.<br><br>Things are fairly good for wizards in Al-Andalus. Magic is an accepted part of Islamic folk religion, and (unlike Christianity) isn&#39;t viewed as automatically evil. Al-Salazar spends his youth in the libraries of Medina Azahara, learning about both magic and the world, and is favoured by the wizard Caliph, Al-Hakam II.<br><br>But the world is not content to simply be learnt about, and Salazar&#39;s studies leave him more and more disturbed. There is an implacable hostility between Al-Andalus and the Christian kingdoms to the north (Leon, Navarre), and the pagans aren&#39;t much better - Viking raids, though a century past, left a mark on the landscape of southern Al-Andalus. They also scarred Salazar&#39;s family, killing his grandparents despite (or even because of) their magic.<br><br>Everywhere he looks, Salazar sees the drawing of battle-lines: not just between religions, but between wizard and Muggle. The Frankish wizarding community is siding with Christendom, trying to buy favour for itself by establishing an anti-Caliphate magic centre in the Pyrenees (which will later become Beauxbatons). Over in Eastern Europe, the peaceful Durmstrang College in Scandinavia has been bent by its second master into an anti-Muggle institution aimed squarely at the Vikings (in fairness, Salazar can sympathise with this). And the Vikings are ranging further and further west, promising future tensions with the Maya who view the whole Western Hemisphere as their area of influence.<br><br>Around 970, following a certain incident with the Caliph&#39;s daughter Lubna of Cordoba (ahem), Salazar begins to travel the world. He visits proto-Beauxbatons, convincing the Frankish wizards to make peace with the Caliphate (though the Caliph&#39;s death in 977 and the subsequent invasions of Christendom reverse this). He trains at Durmstrang under Harfang Munter, introducing the Norse wizard to some of the spells used in the Caliphate. He visits the Mountains of the Moon, learning from the African wizards - and uses their expertise in astronomy to undertake a perilous journey to the New World.<br><br>Salazar&#39;s adventures in Mesoamerica and North America are numerous. He learns to perfect his inborn skill at Parseltongue, and uses it to meet with the ancient Feathered Serpent who lives in the Mayan lands. This turns out to be a Basilisk, which Salazar befriends to the point that it grants him a sliver of its horn to use in his wand.<br><br>Salazar departs, promising the Mayan wizards that he will prevent any Viking incursions into their lands. To this end, he travels first to Iceland, and then to Ireland. In 980, he stands with High King Máel Sechnaill mac Domnaill of Ireland at the Battle of Tara, driving the Vikings out of the Kingdom of Dublin. Then, he journeys to neighboring England.<br><br>Why England, and not Scandinavia itself? Three reasons. First, he trusts Durmstrang to keep a lid on things in the Norse lands. Second, he&#39;s very concerned by the &#39;peace&#39; that has sprung up between the Saxons and the Norse - it looks likely to end with the Norse simply taking over the whole of England. Third, there is a prophecy uttered many years ago - a very confusing one, saying things like &#39;Four must come together for Three to arise, but One will walk a different path&#39; - that suggests Britain is definitely a place to watch.<br><br>He enters Britain in the east, on the edge of the ancient Fens, and in the heart of the former Danelaw. It becomes clear that his suspicions are correct - the Viking settlers are seething with resentment at the Saxon king Aethelred, and it is clear that revolt is not far away. Danish raiding parties already harry the English coast, striking all along the south coast. Salazar tries to calm things down, but he is outed as a wizard, and driven from the Fens. He heads west, towards Winchester and the court of King Aethelred, seeking the famous Champion Godric Gryffindor...<br><br>Or something like that. Obviously none of this is from the books (which don&#39;t even say how old the various schools are), but it serves as backstory to the hypothetical <i>Salazar</i> series. With that in mind - how well does it hold up to both history and canon?<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I like it. The only thing I wonder about is the hostility of the Vikings to magic. I thought they were more tolerant of it than other Europeans? At least as long it was a woman practicing it? Unless you were Odin, then you practice as you please. I don&#39;t know, it&#39;s just what I think I remember from something I read. </p>

            <p>But I think the structure of the Potterverse points directly at magic-hating Vikings. The fact that a Bulgarian stuck Durmstrang up there, with its military bent - the fact that Helga Hufflepuff has a Norse name but lives way over in Wales - the fact that the only Founder who could potentially come from the Danelaw has the least Viking name you can imagine...<br><br>On the other hand, it could almost be the other way round. Maybe the reason the Hufflepuffs went west wasn&#39;t to escape - it was to <i>teach</i>. I don&#39;t know why that Bulgarian witch founded Durmstrang, but her successor - who turned it towards duelling and fighting - has a Norse name, so maybe it&#39;s the <i>Vikings</i> who turned it into what it is today.<br><br>Or perhaps it&#39;s even a combination of the two. The Vikings loved magic, but in an older mode (I&#39;m going to have to mention those Druids again...). We&#39;ve already had mention of the distaff, and Old Norse is a wonderful language for spellcasting. Durmstrang&#39;s second master turned it away from the Latin-based magic its founder used, and towards the old Viking ways. The Hufflepuffs were <i>converts</i>, who found the wand-and-Latin European magic to be better - and were driven out for it.<br><br>We&#39;re now heading into a really interesting place where the conflict is an inter-magical-system war - Latin versus Norse versus Mayan (versus Salazar&#39;s hybrid setup). That&#39;s a <i>very</i> fun story to imagine, much better than &#39;they just hate us&#39;.<br><br>It also reminds me of something that I saw when the map of wizarding schools first appeared - a hypothetical <a href="https://kotaku.com/a-nordic-version-of-harry-potter-1756516804">Nordic magic school</a>. These could definitely be the cast of Norse-mode Durmstrang.<br><br>(Obviously Durmstrang and the Vikings would need to be converted by the 1200s, in time for the Triwizard Tournament. Perhaps the Tournament itself was in celebration of the &#39;normalisation&#39; of magic in Europe - the conversion of Durmstrang, and the final collapse of the Al-Andalus school.)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>It&#39;s been quite a while since I read <i>The Once and Future King</i> for high school, but I do remember Merlin explained his knowledge of the future by telling Arthur that he experienced time backwards—his memories start at his death.  Moving that into the Wizarding World&#39;s universe, it sounds like it could be the bizarre results of an untested curse or potion that used Merlin as a test subject—or perhaps even a failed early model of what would go on to become the time turner?  Regardless of the actual process or event, it&#39;s very clearly magic that involves time in some way.  Perhaps another side effect of the living-backwards is a dramatically extended life span, even by wizard standards?  Then he can still serve King Arthur in the fifth century, closer to his actual birth—the end of his life, from his perspective—but also would have needed to be trained in magic much later in history, closer to his actual death.  By the time Hogwarts opened, he was already an established powerful wizard from everyone else&#39;s perspectives, and the founders surely wouldn&#39;t have turned him away from enrolling, strange as the request must have seemed.<br><br>(Merlin&#39;s experience of life must have been difficult.  Was he &quot;born&quot; on his death bed unable to talk?  Did he have to be taught how to walk and eat?  And think of Hogwarts&#39;s year structure: the seventh year classes must have been insanely difficult for him, not yet having experienced the basic foundations in the classes of any earlier years.)<br><br>—doctorlit, acknowledging that there&#39;s ultimately no evidence to this theory on the Potter end.</p>

            <p><b>Question 1</b><br><br>I am inclined to believe they did. Maybe not from the very childhood (like Slytherin; I doubt he carved his wand at the very old age of eleven... Also, he might&#39;ve just travelled for a plant with particular symbolism), but there is a passage from the Wiki&#39;s page on Godric Gryffindor, which I believe was taken from Rowling&#39;s official site before it redesigned:<br><br>&quot;<i>He also had a versatile mindset as he chose to wield a sword as well as a wand (...)</i>&quot;<br><br>The only mention of Rowena Ravenclaw&#39;s wand is from the Philosopher&#39;s Stone video game, but that&#39;s a dubious source. <br><br>Also, Helga Hufflepuff came from Welsh valleys, not Scandinavia.<br><br><b>Question 2</b><br><br><i>The Wizarding World of Harry Potter</i> (which, again, might be a dubious source, but I believe it had Rowling&#39;s supervision?) kinda answers this one - the castle was designed and <i>built</i> by Rowena and an unnamed wizard architect<br><br><img src="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/harrypotter/images/e/e1/Architect_of_Hogwarts.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20100605163015" width="300"><br><br>So, while I like the idea of the ancestral Ravenclaw House being used, I doubt it.<br><br><b>Question 3</b><br><br>- the Scouring Charm, <i>Scourgify</i>, comes from English.<br>- <i>Alohomora</i> apparently comes from West African Sidiki dialect<br>- <i>Pack</i>, used by Tonks<br><br>And the Sorting Hat once again comes to the rescue, placing Slytherin&#39;s birthplace as &quot;fen&quot;.<br><br><b>Question 4</b> <br><br>I... I have nothing here. The entire &quot;Merlin and Hogwarts&quot; thing is paradoxical enough.<br><br><b>Question 5</b><br><br>This is another one of the &#39;maybes&#39;, but I&#39;m gonna use my linguistic knowledge to explain this one:<br><br>There are two most common reasons for adopting words and phrases (and spells I guess?) from another language:<br>a) Necessity - when there is no word or phrase in your native language that would describe the phenomenon/object/etc.<br>b) Fashion - when something from the other country is viewed as prestigious, fancy, luxurious, the adoption of the foreign term and replacement of the native term might occur.<br><br>And now I&#39;m gonna go with a hypothesis pulled straight outta nowhere:<br><br>&quot;Danelaw: a part of England in which the laws of the Danes held sway and dominated those of the Anglo-Saxons.&quot; Danelaw appeared as early as the 9th century. And the two parts did held non-hostile relationship, as evident by many Old Norse words entering the English language.<br><br>On the Wizarding side, one factor was, as you mentioned, the appearance of Ollivander Prime, who established his famous shop and gained popularity due to his Roman wandmaking technique. In real life Scandinavian Magic, wands weren&#39;t used; instead, sorcerers would mostly use a distaff, a tool used for spinning flax and wool. But just encountering wands wouldn&#39;t be enough as, fun fact, the word &#39;wand&#39; comes from Old Norse &quot;vǫndr&quot;, and might be related to &quot;wind&quot;. <br><br>But the spells <i>produced</i> by wands are a different thing. Perhaps the Scandinavians didn&#39;t know half as many convenient spells as the Britons did and the effects couldn&#39;t be achieved with the use of a distaff, so they were forced to switch to wands and use words associated with wands.</p>

            <p><i>Bold Gryffindor, from wild moor,<br>Fair Ravenclaw, from glen,<br>Sweet Hufflepuff, from valley broad,<br>Shrewd Slytherin, from fen.</i><br><br>First off, I have to quibble the word &#39;from&#39;. If you ask my wife where she&#39;s from (after she says &#39;America&#39;), she probably won&#39;t name the state she was born in. That&#39;s not where she was raised, or where she spent her teenage years. So &#39;from&#39; doesn&#39;t have to mean &#39;started from&#39;; heck, it could literally mean &#39;this is where they were when they had a magical conversation about making a school&#39;.<br><br>But setting that aside, let&#39;s assume we can trust Godric&#39;s hat (I&#39;d forgotten it was his hat; I bet he looked really goofy in it). We can also assume that the <i>narration</i> of the Harry Potter series is trustworthy when it discusses the Founders - given that there&#39;s at least one intelligent artefact plus multiple ghosts from the time in question, it would be unreasonable to think it was wrong. What does the Hat&#39;s song tell us about the Founders, and how does it stand up to what we already know?<br><br><b>Bold Gryffindor, from wild moor</b><br><br>We know that Godric Gryffindor was born in Godric&#39;s Hollow (per <i>Deathly Hallows</i>), which is in the West Country. That term usually means Devon and Cornwall, plus everything up to Somerset - pretty much everything west of the Isle of Wight and south of Wales. The <i>Hat</i> tells us he was from a moor - so where is that?<br><br>The obvious answer is that Godric was from either Exmoor or Dartmoor, down in Devon (though Exmoor extends into Somerset). I see no issues with that; it makes him thoroughly English, and from the region which remained English while the Danelaw was in place. Let&#39;s move on.<br><br><b>Fair Ravenclaw, from glen</b><br><br>Rowena Ravenclaw was Scottish. The word &#39;glen&#39; is exclusive to Scotland. It&#39;s sometimes exclusive to the Highlands, in the north of Scotland - and what a coincidence, Hogwarts Castle is in the Highlands too.<br><br>But was she <i>born</i> Scottish? &#39;Ravenclaw&#39; is probably her married name - her daughter shares it, and an out-of-wedlock child in the 10th century would be... unusual. &#39;Rowena&#39;, however, is a Latinised <i>Saxon</i> name. So might she be a Saxon of one kind or another, who moved north and married?<br><br>Alternately, she could be born in Scotland, but of Saxon ancestry. About a hundred years before the Founding, the northern Saxon kingdoms came under Viking rule. Could Rowena&#39;s family have fled north, to the safety of the independent kingdom of Strathclyde? Perhaps. Let&#39;s move on.<br><br><b>Sweet Hufflepuff, from valley broad</b><br><br>Helga Hufflepuff is... actually not confirmed as Welsh. Okay, she&#39;s Welsh in the Wizarding World of Harry Potter, but as a non-narrative source is up for debate. If you assume that moor, glen, valley, and fen are intended to point directly at their homelands, then yes, she&#39;s from The Valleys in South Wales. But... y&#39;know, &#39;valley&#39; is a pretty generic term.<br><br>There&#39;s also her name. Helga is a Scandinavian name, no ifs, no buts. Wherever she lived, Helga has Viking ancestry.<br><br>So could she be a Viking in Wales? Um... not really! The Danelaw was separated from Wales by English Mercia. The region was the last to be conquered during the near-fall of Wessex, and the first to be reclaimed. And, Wales was <i>British</i>, not Saxon - it wasn&#39;t even part of those squabbles!<br><br>I think the most harmonious option is the one I suggested  elsewhere - that Helga&#39;s family also fled the Vikings, though they were of Viking descent. This is becoming a hint that the Norse were very anti-wizard - and there might actually be more evidence for that!<br><br>Look at Durmstrang. It was founded in Scandinavia, but by a Bulgarian, not a local. It&#39;s the only school that teaches the Dark Arts. It also flatly refuses to accept Muggleborns. What I&#39;m wondering is whether Durmstrang was actually set up as a pseudo-<i>military</i> establishment - a guard to watch against the violence of the Muggle Norse, and to protect the few Norse wizards and witches who escaped them.<br><br>Okay, let&#39;s leave that for now and move onto our most mysterious Founder:<br><br><b>Shrewd Slytherin, from fen</b><br><br>The Fens are in eastern England, but &#39;fen&#39; itself is also a generic term for swamp. If we assume that the geographical terms are supposed to be capitalised (the Moors, the Glens, the Valleys, the Fens), then Slytherin is from the east, Godric from the south, Helga from the west, and Rowena from the north - all very neat and tidy.<br><br>The other theory out there is that he&#39;s Irish, Ireland having a fair amount of bog-land (&#39;bog&#39; wouldn&#39;t scan, and &#39;fen&#39; is a near-synonym). That would give us English-Scottish-Welsh-Irish for the Founders, all very neat.<br><br>But... Salazar is a Portugese name. In fact, it&#39;s a Portugese <i>surname</i>, not a first name at all. So what in the world is it doing on a Saxon or Irish wizard?<br><br>Hence what Scapegrace dubbed the &#39;al-Salazar theory&#39; - that Slytherin isn&#39;t British at all, but from Iberia. It would make sense of his name, and also highlight him as separate from the other three - which, in the end, he was.<br><br>There are other ideas pointing to Salazar as a traveller. He&#39;s friends with a basilisk, which were invented in Greece (according to a chocolate frog card, of all things). He also has a wand made of snakewood, which as I said before, exists only in the Americas and Australia. Hmm... side-thought, there&#39;s a Feathered Serpent in Mesoamerican mythology which was worshipped from about the turn of the BC/AD years. That&#39;s a thousand years before Slytherin lived. Is it possible that the basilisk horn in Salazar&#39;s wand comes from Quetzalcoatl - that the Feathered Serpent was his first contact with basilisks, and led to his decision to breed his own?<br><br>Coming back to the point... there <i>are</i> wetlands in Iberia, but it&#39;s not exactly known for it. I think the most likely option is that Salazar came into Britain <i>by way of</i> either the Fens or Ireland (and indeed stayed there a while, so he could be said to be &#39;from&#39; them). Either would be a good origin from a geographical perspective - coming via the Fens would mean he lived in the (former) Danelaw, meaning we have a Saxon-Welsh-Scottish-Viking setup, while Ireland would feed the anti-Viking story by letting him <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=297622;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">help drive them out</a>.<br><br>Al-Salazar is a stretch. It&#39;s meant to be a stretch. I&#39;m almost positive Rowling just liked the word and used it for her evil wizard, who was probably from the Fens. But there&#39;s just enough ambiguity for me to push my own version. ^_~<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>1/ I know Helga is Welsh, but her name is literally Helga - she&#39;s of Scandinavian extraction, no doubt about it. ^<em>^ My assumption is that her parents were raiders who settled; they would have been a bit &#39;out of the way&#39;, so to speak, since Wales wasn&#39;t really in the Viking invasion path, but wizards tend to live apart as it is. If there was some sort of disagreement with Viking Muggles - or even with Viking wizardom - they could easily run away to Wales.<br><br>2/ Well, far be it from me to argue with a source of any description (with one exception, see below ^</em>~). New idea: what if the castle was built <i>around</i> Castle Ravenclaw? Or, more precisely - around Ravenclaw Tower?

Of course you have to remember that the Anglo-Saxons weren&#39;t terribly fond of Rome either, so Saxon-Danish peaceful contact doesn&#39;t help with the spread of Latin. (It&#39;s probably worth pointing out that most inhabitants would barely have noticed whether the rulers were Saxon, Danish, or Norman - they were too busy being poor and hungry and using whatever words came their way.) But on the flip side, maybe wizards aren&#39;t as parochial. Maybe it <i>was</i> a fashion thing, spread by apparition in the BC years, and by the time Ollivander Prime (^_~) showed up, all the European wizards were using Latin wherever they were from.<br><br>hS</p>

        <div class="post-body">
            <p>So, it&#39;s been a little while since I posted on here again, because of the approaching end to my semester, and because lately I&#39;ve been focusing my efforts into the stuff I want to put into The Pit. As the title of this post indicates, I would like to ask for some advice, after I give a setup to what I have planned. (I will try to avoid spoilers for my own stuff, though.)<br><br>Everyone remember the Legendary Badfic series &quot;The Girl Who Lived&quot;? Well, I remember reading it back in (I think) late 2013- early 2014, and being distinctly disappointed. Obviously, as it&#39;s classified as a Legendary Badfic, it was not very good. The titular Rose Potter was at times an over-the-top and irrationally stupid and angry Mary Sue. The other characters didn&#39;t react to Rose Potter in a way that made any sense, and sometimes, like in the case of Hermione, were portrayed as being ignorant and backwards for disagreeing with the Druid lifestyle, and with Rose being an aggressive numbskull. <br><br>But what really rubbed me the wrong way was the way in which the author did not use the story elements that they introduced in a satisfactory way. For example, the series introduces the idea that Dementors are actually the remains of Necromancers who had used some kind of ritual to try and achieve immortality, or something. This part of the story was retold during the court scene in Order of the Phoenix, and then was never even mentioned again. The Druids, meanwhile, were deliberately hidden from the rest of the world, but being exposed to the outside world through their interactions with Rose Potter didn&#39;t cause any narrative conflict. <br><br>This caused me to want to write my own version of The Girl Who Lived, but I obviously had a lot of changes that I wanted to make. For instance, I decided to use the original Rose Potter&#39;s bad temper as a character flaw, that had consequences and that she has to work to overcome. I also decided to use the ability that the source material calls Void as a plot device. <br><br>The Druids will have a lot of changes made to them, though. Unlike in the source material, the Druids&#39; existence is not a secret to the rest of the world. They do, however, have a complicated history with the rest of the Wizarding World, mostly because of a Druid faction I called the Puritan Movement. The Puritan Movement worships the earth as manifested by the goddess Gaia, like the rest of the Druids, but they&#39;re different in one important way. They believe that humanity is causing harm to the planet, by way of existing. There are further factions in the Puritan Movement, but the one that is the most troublesome is the one that secretly wants to &quot;purge Gaia of the scourge of humanity&quot;. Sounds cartoonish, I know, but I will work hard to try and make their viewpoint at least seem logical and (maybe) sympathetic. When Rose Potter joins their ranks, the Druids are not exactly welcoming to her at first, because of the complicated history that they have with the outside world. <br><br>The Necromancers, meanwhile, are thought to have been almost completely wiped out. However, there is secretly a Necromancer among the cast of OC&#39;s I have created for the series. His goal is to continue his cycle of immortality. Simple on paper, but more complicated on closer inspection because of the nature of the ritual that he needs to use. He has a personal history with the Druids, but is simultaneously exploiting the events of the Harry/Rose Potter wizard side of the story.<br><br>Apart from the main cast of the Rose Potter original source material, I have created a cast of original characters (as I have said in the previous paragraph; isn&#39;t redundancy fun?). The Russo siblings- a brother and sister (whose names I have yet to come up with)- will be working in the background of the Harry/Rose Potter storyline toward their own goals, having to do with the Druids and the Necromancer, with whom they unknowingly have a personal history. The sister is Sorted into Gryffindore, while the brother is Sorted into Slytherin. This will obviously cause a little bit of tension, but I wanted to do it this way because it has the potential to open up a wide array of different perspectives and characters. <br><br>Apart from the main seven stories, I am also planning to write stories on aspects of life in the Wizarding World of Harry/Rose Potter that I don&#39;t think have been explored yet. For example, I have a horror story in the works that focuses on the troubled members of a heavy metal band who have hit a patch of abysmal reviews for their previous work. I chose to do this because it focuses on an area of wizarding subculture that has only been touched upon in the original work. (Harry Potter has a band called The Weird Sisters, which I&#39;ve been unable to find much about, but it seems that they&#39;re in the same rock genre as Alice Cooper, minus the corpse paint.)<br><br>Also in further, more original stories based in my prospective Rose Potter Universe, I focus on some aspects of wizarding society that I personally would be interested in knowing about. For example, from Philosopher&#39;s Stone to Deathly Hallows and beyond, I will begin focusing on more partisan politics in the Ministry of Magic, with a set of political parties called the Conservative Party (or Tories), the Progressive Party (which will eventually include Hermione Granger in their ranks), and the Centrist Party (which is more of an umbrella term that refers to Ministry members that simply don&#39;t fit into the two-party system). Meanwhile, the International Confederation of Wizards is negotiating the implementation of an internationally accepted currency, and they&#39;re trying to maintain relations with both the Druids and the Volturi Coven of vampires in Italy.<br><br>That&#39;s right, the Rose Potter Universe is eventually going to cross over into the Twilight-verse, which will also be changed up a bit. The biggest, most significant change that I should mention that doesn&#39;t spoil anything is that the Volturi, originally the undisputed international authority in the Twilight source material, is fighting for control with the Alucard Coven. The Alucard Coven claims to be a group of direct descendants from the original Vlad Dracula, and they&#39;re quickly gaining support among the vampire community. The big issue in the Rose Potter Universe of my own creation in regard to the vampires is who the wizards should back for supremacy.<br><br>However, there are some things I may need some help with (hence the title of this post). <br><br>1. Something that I found interesting when I looked into fanon tropes was the Dumbledore-is-a-manipulative-old-man trope. Obviously, upon closer inspection, Dumbledore inhabits a sort of moral gray area, since he knew about the Horcrux being inside Harry Potter (since the original Rose Potter never got that far) and he didn&#39;t tell him about it. But my big question is, what are the other details of the trope? How can I use this trope to make Dumbledore a more complicated character without making him an outright antagonist?<br><br>2. As I have explained above, I intend to take the Rose Potter Universe beyond the seven stories from the original Harry Potter source material, and explore some untouched areas of wizarding world society. Can anybody think of some areas that haven&#39;t been explored yet? What *controversial* area of wizarding life would you be interested in?<br><br>3. A certain member of my series&#39; original characters list (no spoilers, so I&#39;m not saying who it is) is destined to take the title of &quot;Most Dangerous Dark Wizard of all time&quot;. However, I&#39;m going down a much less conventional route to accomplish this. For example, the character is genuinely interested in improving life for the wizarding world (even if it&#39;s at the expense of other communities, especially the vampires). And they never seek out the title, but the title is bestowed upon them by The Daily Prophet during a time of hyper-partisanship in the post-Deathly Hallows Ministry. On top of that, a lot of &quot;ordinary witches and wizards&quot; (meaning the citizenry) are going to support their efforts, and the biggest problem with the character is the company they keep. But what I wanted to ask in this area is how I can make this character even more complex, and possibly morally ambiguous. Any ideas, anyone? <br><br>4. I will admit, I have actually tried to read Twilight before, and I found it incredibly painful and boring to read. The main reason, I think, was the way in which it was written to sound like Bella didn&#39;t care too much about what was going on. But on top of that, I have heard that the Bella/Edward relationship has garnered a lot of criticism for its ostensibly abusive nature. This is a lot to work with, but can anyone help me find other major problems with the Twilight Saga (since I didn&#39;t read much past the halfway point in Chapter 2)?<br><br>Now I know that I have given myself a lot of work to do with this series, but I&#39;m actually getting pretty close to the actual writing for some of the stories. That being said, I have some more planning that needs to be done, and I want to get it as close to right as I can. Any help that you can give me on the conceptual level is appreciated.<br><br>I&#39;ll be sure to let everyone know when I have them ready, and once I do, I&#39;ll obviously want some constructive criticism. That&#39;s looking into the future a bit, but it&#39;ll be fun! (It does mean, however, that I won&#39;t be able to post on here as much as I would like. Oh well.)<br><br>- WastedMoth</p>

<li>Ah yes, Rose Potter. The nudist, Neopagan, jackrabbit Ideology Sue. (No problem with the Neopagan part, though - I have a couple friends who are.) All that stuff you mentioned is typical for an Ideology Suefic.<br><br>0.5. Ah! Nice! I too have had an idea to write a de-Sued version of a fanfic (my inspiration was Starkit&#39;s Prophecy), so perhaps I can help. Overall this seems nice where you&#39;re going.

Er...I&#39;m really not sure how to do the complexity thing (I mean, I can do it, but I don&#39;t know any exact steps.) Springhole.net, however, has a page about morally ambiguous characters (link below my signature). Maybe that will help?<br><br>2. The effects of muggle conflicts (World Wars, etc) on the wizarding world. That might be a good one.<br><br>4. Wait, if you were bored by Twilight so much, why are you even making this a crossover? Why not just make the vampires a thing that happens in the story without including Twilight, since vampires exist in Harry Potter? Is it because of the Sueness of both, or what?<br><br>I hope this helps and I&#39;d love to beta read if needed!<br><br>-Twistey<br>----<br><a href="http://www.springhole.net/writing/writing-sympathetic-morally-ambiguous-characters.htm"><a href="http://www.springhole.net/writing/writing-sympathetic-morally-ambiguous-characters.htm">http://www.springhole.net/writing/writing-sympathetic-morally-ambiguous-characters.htm</a></a></li>

            <p>Other than sudden shrinking of British Empire, the bombing at Dunkirk, and possible enlistment of mages(?) as soldiery, are there any others effects on the Wizarding World in England? I think mages in Continental Europe are far more affected, and those in the colonies even more.</p>

It&#39;s the thought that counts.<br><br>Naruto (Games + Wiki diving), Star Wars (movies + Wiki diving), My Hero Academia (Anime), buncha games like Dragon&#39;s Dogma, Dead Rising and the like - console scrub here though, but I do play HotS here and there.

            <p>Hi there! I&#39;m Twistey, a very friendly lightly-used-bie (as I call myself), master fruit ninja, amateur writer, and hopefully soon-to-be Newgrounds developer. I have too many ideas and too many fandoms, and my brain runs a mile a minute at times (like now, it seems.) My writing strongsuit is character creation and Sue detection, so if anyone needs help with that, I can give advice.<br><br>Enough about me, how about you? What fandoms, aspects of writing, aspects of the PPC, etc. are you interested in? What type of fanfic do you want to cover? Do you have any original worlds or notable fanfics? What about agent ideas? I&#39;d love to know! :)<br><br>Finally, for your newbie gift. Since your innocence has flown the coop as mine has somewhat, I give you this cozy hoodie designed to somewhat resemble the mechsuit from Wolfenstein 3D. May it grant you feelings of protection and invincibility, but try not to become as evil as the owner of the actual mechsuit. You&#39;d probably get a frying pan to the face (I won&#39;t say by who.) You never know whether you&#39;re fully recovered until you truly are, but in case you are, give it to your agents. They&#39;ll need it.<br><br>Anyway, nice to meet you! I hope you have a wonderful time here, and welcome to the PPC.<br><br>-Twistey</p>

I&#39;ll be sure to come to you when I need help on those two fronts.<br><br>I&#39;d say the one noteworthy fandom I&#39;ve got is Naruto, maybe My Hero Academia has some poorly-written fics out there. I&#39;ve dipped my toes in Harry Potter but I&#39;m still halfway through PoA (don&#39;t judge meh.) I&#39;m interested in badfics, they&#39;re harrowing and make me lose faith in humanity, so it&#39;s only fair someone gets to rip and tear into them. Currently, no for the original worlds or notable fanfics that I&#39;ve got. And yeah, I do have an idea for a couple of Agents, but I cannot reveal them just yet!<br><br>Y&#39;know.. Iximaz gave me a suit of cursed armour that was supposed to help me and &#39;&quot;totally not turn evil, I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about.&quot; So, I think I&#39;ll keep that for my agents.<br><br>Thanks!</p>

So yeah.)<br><br>1. Well, I&#39;m not very good at ping-pong, for one thing. I thought I was but then proved myself wrong. I also wasn&#39;t always good at writing; I wrote some pretty bad fanfic and original stuff right up until the point that I got the notion that good writing is important. There are lots of other things I&#39;m not, but my brain is too muddled by earliness to put them into words. Just know I&#39;m human and not Suvian, okay? ;P<br><br>2. Okay, that&#39;s pretty cool about the fandoms. True, badfics can get verrry bad and gross. I read the summary on the Wiki of C-brian and just noped out before even reading the real thing, and I have a feeling that there is potential for worse to exist. Ooh, mysteriousness about the agent ideas. Suspense, yay!<br><br>3. Haha! It seems there&#39;s a prankster in all of us &#39;round here.

            <p>So, as Thanksgiving is around the corner, I have a question that I would like to throw out there for those of you with Permission:<br><br><i>What are your Agents thankful for?</i><br><br>Allow me to explain. First off, I am <i>not</i> trying to start an RP here (though if someone wants to take that idea nad run with it, feel free). I am simply asking: if someone were to ask your Agents &quot;What are you thankful for?&quot;, how would they respond? E.g.: would Falchion be thankful for his hoard of shiny things to roost on? Would Sarah Squall be thankful for meeting her &quot;brother&quot;? Inquisitive minds want to know!</p>

            <p>Tom would probably shrug his shoulders. He&#39;s thankful for mundane things. Like KT, and DMR. Like S-expresssions. Like not having to fear for your life or worry about the oncoming apocalypse. Like sugary, caffeinated beverages.<br><br>You know, the usual.<br><br>Thoth... well, He&#39;ll say it himself.<br><br>&quot;I am thankful there is a realm where reason and rationality prevails over superstition.

            <p>(I&#39;ve got ideas for agents, but due to various circumstances I cannot ask for Permission just yet. So here are my pre-Agents.)<br><br>Amber, Miriam, Connor and Erika are all thankful for each other, quite obviously, being a close-knit group of three siblings and one very good friend/partner. They&#39;re also thankful for both the families they came from and their new family at the PPC.<br><br>Morgana and Gretchen are thankful that I was kind enough to de-Sue-ify them from their intentional badfic of origin back in Fanfic World (just because I felt like de-Sue-ifying something, y&#39;know?) Gretchen in particular is also thankful that I also gave her an animal/young child hybrid companion that was summoned in the complete version of the fic, because he&#39;s adorable and a good pet/adopted child. Morana is thankful that Sues have glitter blood, because she retained a watered-down form of the glitter obsession from her previous incarnation, combined with the new trait of only liking it more knowing that it&#39;s also the blood of slain Sues.<br><br>That&#39;s all I have so far.<br><br>-Twistey</p>

            <p>The Aviator&#39;s is a no-brainer: Thanksgiving this year also happens to fall on <i>Doctor Who</i>&#39;s 54th anniversary, which is also totally coincidentally Elanor&#39;s first birthday. So she&#39;s thankful for both of those—and thankful she&#39;s still alive.<br><br>She&#39;s most certainly not thankful for the Detective. Who told you that?<br><br>Zeb&#39;s thankful for another good year of agenting. He&#39;s been all but adopted into the Aviator&#39;s family at this point and he couldn&#39;t be happier.<br><br>Ix and Charlotte are thankful for the PPC and how it brought them together and improved their lives.<br><br>Alex is thankful for Zeke, and for the fact that his intern seems to have calmed down somewhat since her arrival.<br><br>Farilan is most certainly not thankful for this ridiculous human tradition of feel-good nonsense.<br><br>...But it was nice finding a friend in Ilraen.</p>

As a result, there are many ways we could still operate outside of the infrastructure that the Telecom Mafia controls. Find out if your town has a community broadband network, and start volunteering if you can. Try to see if you can get your town to adopt a fiber-to-home network. I know that there are some Ham Radio enthusiasts here -- now is the time to start putting that equipment to use.<br><br>One thing you can do right now, even if you have no money or time, is to start operating sneakernets[1] or pirateboxes[2] to try to build up the network effect, or start moving onto peer-to-peer networks. You could even set up a Retroshare network and share the information you want to share with your friends yourself rather than relying on a content delivery provider which could be censored or blocked by your ISP.<br><br>Don&#39;t forget about peer-to-peer networks like I2P. Peer to peer networks can be difficult to censor or block without completely redoing the entire federated model that the Internet relies on. Volunteer networks such as Tor hidden services can be difficult to censor or block (there are ways to block Tor exit nodes and guard nodes, but there are ways to circumvent these blocks through the use of Onionsites and Tor Bridges). If the ISPs insist on blocking and censoring, we can use tunnelling to circumvent it. Many of these nodes exist outside the United States and won&#39;t need to answer to US Policy. If the guard nodes start getting blocked, use a Bridge.<br><br>Also, while this can be a bit of a long shot, ask your favourite content provider about domain fronting[3] and see what could be done about that. This is one way to make it expensive or costly for the ISPs to start throttling or shutting off access to particular sites, since there are ways (Domain Fronting is one of them) to use encryption to disguise traffic they want to block as something they don&#39;t.<br><br>There are ways we can fight back, we just need to use them.<br><br><br>[1] A sneakernet is simply a fancy way of saving data to a CD or a USB drive, and carrying it to where it needs to go by walking (hence, shoes, or sneakers) to the destination.<br>[2] Piratebox: A piratebox is simply a regular off the shelf wifi router attached to some means of storage that can be used to create ad-hoc portable networks.

            <p>So I have been on the Discord for awhile now, about 2-3 months, and have finally gathered the courage to introduce myself. Hi. I have been told that I should state my prefered fandoms, so here we go: Warhammer 40k, the Rithmatist, Homestuck, Artemis Fowl, the Leviathan Trilogy, Boarderlands, Startrek.

            <p>Hey there! I&#39;m Twistey, a lightly-used-bie and creator of original worlds who has too many fandoms (my biggest one currently is Wolfenstein 3D, and my most recently joined one is Cuphead, which I got into just yesterday or so!) I approve of quite a few of those fandoms you&#39;ve got there. Nice. :)<br><br>Anyway, what about some other stuff? What aspects of writing and of the PPC are you interested in the most? Any notable works of writing you&#39;ve already written? Any agent ideas? I&#39;d love to know!<br><br>Finally, for your newbie gift. Here&#39;s a bunch of replica Soul Contracts, one for every boss in Cuphead. Hang them up on a wall or something, or give them to your agents and let them decorate. Maybe they might interest you enough to go find out what Cuphead is all about (and you won&#39;t regret that, it&#39;s a pretty fun game.)<br><br>Nice to meet you! Have a wonderful time here and welcome to the PPC!<br><br>-Twistey</p>

            <p>Hey, I&#39;m R. Longtime stalker, first time talker, I suppose, although reading through the Original Series, a few spin offs, clicking through the wiki, and then forgetting the PPC even exists for a year (repeat the cycle at least three times, stir, and bake at 350 degrees for optimum results) makes less a &quot;longtime stalker&quot; and more an &quot;intermittent fan&quot; I suppose. <br><br>I&#39;m a fan of quite a lot of things, overly wordy introductions to hide anxieties and unnecessarily complicated humor notwithstanding. As far as fandoms go, the brief (well, briefer) list goes: Marvel (comics focused, but also the shows and movies as well), Star Trek, Doctor Who (Classic Series, New Series, Torchwood, Scream of the Shalka, the Gallifrey audio series, I&#39;m in far too deep please help me), Harry Potter, Star Wars, Lord of the Rings, Homestuck, Stargate, Highlander (the TV series, although I do like the movies), Dragonriders of Pern, A Series of Unfortunate Events, Steven Universe, Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki Kun, Avatar: the Last Airbender, the Librarians, and Dungeons and Dragons. <br><br>What else do you put in an introduction other than fandoms. Uh, I work as a kind of writing mentor to young (mostly eleven to thirteen year old) children, so my tolerance of bad spelling and grammar is simultaneously much harsher than others and also very high? That&#39;s enough interesting facts about me for the day.  <br><br>The PPC has always been a hilarious fallback for me when bored and wanting characterization-focused heavy violence, and while I&#39;m hoping to end up writing, mostly I kind of just want to hang out, make friends (?), and read good fic.</p>

            <p>Hey there R! I&#39;m Twistey, a lightly-used-bie and all-around world creator currently working on my Newgrounds debut. I have too many fandoms - from Wolfenstein 3D to MLP:FIM and tons of things in between (but I&#39;m pretty sure that&#39;s the range of masculinity/femininity in my tastes, no further outwards.) I am also very passionate about learning how to write well and teaching others writing stuff.<br><br>But enough about me, how about you? What aspects of writing and the PPC do you most like (maybe clarify what &quot;characterization-focused heavy violence&quot; means?) and what type of stuff do you want to write here? Do you have any notable original works or fanfic? How about agent ideas? I&#39;m excited to know more! :)<br><br>Finally, for your newbie gift, here&#39;s a mix of stuff from my original worlds: a skateboarding helmet and knee pads with the same design as one of the default characters in my tabletop RPG project &quot;Alleys and Aliens&quot;, a brooch pin for the Shock Battalion or &quot;Shockers&quot; from my newest story &quot;The Year the Sky Fell&quot;, this impressive-looking replica of the bow wielded by a prominent antagonist of my shared-continuum story &quot;Wings&quot;, and a plain red hoodie like the one worn by the protagonist of my WIP fairy-tale-themed puzzle game &quot;Little Red&quot;. For the most accuracy to the character, tie the sleeves around your neck and wear it as a hoodie-cape. Distribute them among your agents and yourself as you desire, and if you want pictures of the stuff I gave you, I can draw some.<br><br>Anyway, nice to meet you! Have a great time here and welcome to the PPC!<br><br>-Twistey</p>

            <p>Thank you so much for those gifts, they sound awesome. <br><br>I haven’t started published very much of my finished writing, but there’s fanfiction of various qualities floating around. Mostly I slowly work on some original fiction novels - an Arabian Nights/Arthurian Legend fusion, and a fairy tale trope reversal thing. <br><br>I’ve got a few ideas for agents, although they aren’t yet fully formed. The idea of a fanfiction writer from within a fandom universe.  I’d definitely like to write Marvel - there’s so much there. So much really bad fanfic. <br><br>Why I like PPC- it’s a mix, I suppose, between how much I adore character-driven stories, how fun MST3K style commentary can be, and, yeah, all the fun, creative ways people have found to kill sues. <br></p>

            <p>But is this series sucky enough to be mission material? I should note that the character learns to speak the language of carnivorous dinosaurs later. Along with skillfully wielding a bow and arrow, is that Mary-Sueish?</p>

            <p>Hello, I guess I should introduce myself.  <br><br>I&#39;m into a lot of things sci-fi and fantasy, too many to really list.  <br><br>I also got back into World of Warcraft lately on a WotLK server.  I had played BC-WotLK and ragequit in the early days of Cataclysm because I could never catch up to the gear requirements for raiding and people in dungeons were always trying to beat old speedrun records.  On my current server, it&#39;s always the same patch forever.<br><br>I&#39;m here because while I think I&#39;m a decent writer, I could use some improvement.  I&#39;ve noticed that it&#39;s hard to get feedback if you&#39;re writing in a universe that serious reviewers have no interest in.  I figure that since you concrit a lot and care about PPC stories being good, I should try my luck.</p>

            <p>Huh! I hope that we can be of use with that reviewing thing!<br><br>Anyway, hi, I&#39;m Twistey! I haven&#39;t been here too long, but am pretty active and try to help with anyone I can. I&#39;m in too many fandoms and have too many original stories, but that&#39;s fine. I&#39;m rather strong with evaluating characters based on bios and sometimes with writing itself.<br><br>Anyway, how about you? I guess I shouldn&#39;t get you started on listing fandoms, so I&#39;ll ask you some other questions: Any agent ideas? Any notable works of fanfic or original fic? What do you plan to do with your time here, aside from getting writing help? I&#39;d love to know more! :)<br><br>As for your newbie gift, here, have an egg. It looks like a chicken egg, except it&#39;s the size of an ostrich&#39;s egg. (But it&#39;s chicken egg shaped.) Who knows what will hatch out of this?<br><br>It&#39;s nice to meet you!

            <p>I got my account back when you could explore the books (I forgot, did that get removed? I thought it did?), got stuck in the middle of Chamber, and stopped using it because I was, well, stuck. All I remember of test taking is that I&#39;m a Ravenclaw. I probably am also in Horned Serpent for Ilvermorny (since that&#39;s essentially the Ravenclaw of that school), but I haven&#39;t actually taken the test. I didn&#39;t take the patronus and I don&#39;t remember my wand.<br><br>But let me tell you a funny story. I have a big friend group that I encountered completely by chance, and there&#39;s this one guy who thinks he&#39;s dark and edgy but is really more like a sad puppy in nature. Everyone else in the group knows it. So we all got into a debate with him about his Hogwarts house, and to prove our point, one friend got out her laptop and had him take the Pottermore test. The results confirmed it, he was a Hufflepuff. It was great to see his reaction. Didn&#39;t do anything to make him stop denying that, though.<br><br>-Twistey</p>

            <p>Back in 2011, when the old Pottermore was still in beta test, I was sorted into Slytherin. I guess I got that for an attempt to cheat and get into Hufflepuff (the only common room we’ve never seen in the books). <br><br>A far more sophisticated test by PersonalityLab that sadly isn’t available anymore asked me a hundred questions and then told me that Slytherin is actually the house I’m least compatible with (52%) and that I should have been sorted into Gryffindor (68%), with Ravenclaw as second (64%) and Hufflepuff as a third (56%) choice. It’s all so close together that I may just be a jack-of-all-trades, although I feel like I should be a Ravenpuff or Huffleclaw.<br><br>My wand is alder wood with unicorn tail hair, 10.75 inches long and surprisingly swishy.<br><br>Since I never bothered to sign up for the new Pottermore, I don’t know my Patronus and my Ilvermorny house. To me, the important part of Pottermore is the &quot;Writing by J.K. Rowling&quot;, and I don’t need to sign up to get this. Although, collecting it on the old Pottermore (and needing a wand and to have been sorted to be able to do so) was definitely more fun.<br><br>HG</p>

            <p>Redwood<br><br>&quot;Wand-quality redwood is in short supply, yet constant demand, due to its reputation for bringing good fortune to its owner. As is usually the case with wandlore, the general populace have the truth back to front: redwood wands are not themselves lucky, but are strongly attracted to witches and wizards who already possess the admirable ability to fall on their feet, to make the right choice, to snatch advantage from catastrophe. The combination of such a witch or wizard with a redwood wand is always intriguing, and I generally expect to hear of exciting exploits when I send this special pairing out from my workshop.&quot;<br><br>Unicorn<br><br>&quot;Unicorn hair generally produces the most consistent magic, and is least subject to fluctuations and blockages. Wands with unicorn cores are generally the most difficult to turn to the Dark Arts. They are the most faithful of all wands, and usually remain strongly attached to their first owner, irrespective of whether he or she was an accomplished witch or wizard. Minor disadvantages of unicorn hair are that they do not make the most powerful wands (although the wand wood may compensate) and that they are prone to melancholy if seriously mishandled, meaning that the hair may &#39;die&#39; and need replacing.&quot;<br><br><br>I don&#39;t think a Patronus has any personality meaning...<br><br>And yer right about the House:<br><br>You might belong in Gryffindor,<br>Where dwell the brave at heart,<br>Their daring, nerve, and chivalry<br>Set Gryffindors apart</p>

            <p>Yeah, I know he&#39;s not around much; he still gets a Plortrait. I&#39;m six images deep into a list of nine, I can&#39;t stop now!<br><br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/MyhjikM.png"><br><br>Fun fact #1: At first I was really worried about this one, because I don&#39;t have a clue what PC looks like. Then it stuck me - he owns the mines, so I can put him in full plate armour and cover his face! Great... except his Cyclopaedia article describes how he cast aside his armour. Oh. :( ... in favour of face-covering black robes. Yay!<br><br>Fun fact #2: This the first time I have deliberately altered one of Scape&#39;s flags (other than leaving room for a ninth star in Eshakhar&#39;s). I figured the swords on the flag were the only ones available, so replaced them with the Sword of Jay for the picture.<br><br>Fun fact #3: Baron PC has way too many weapons! I&#39;ve given him the twin daggers Xericka (left) and Gremlyn (right), because I haven&#39;t done daggers yet, as well as the maul Racalendaris, because giant hammers are fun.<br><br>Fun fact #4: I&#39;m pretty sure the flag and maul are just floating along behind him, rather than being strapped in place.

            <p>There is still no Plort Wiki page for the Confederation of Diskord, and thus no image of the Diskord’s flag on the Wiki (the Proceedings of the 2017 Council of Plort still link to the <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=310063;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">PPC Board discussion</a>).<br><br>Also, the page for the Union of Plort still ignores the fifth nation and the new flag (again, the Proceedings of the 2017 Council of Plort still link to the <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=310125;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">PPC Board discussion</a>).

            <p>I cannot parse the Plortish names and terms into the normal names and terms.

            <p>Better a bit late than too late!<br><br>These are awesome :D I like that you did it, and I like my flag (though it is a little complex...eh, whatever, I like me a bit of complexity. The fictional people sewing the flag can put up with it). The one thing I would like changed: there are eight stars on the flag, but nine in the original coat of arms. I&#39;d like to keep the meaning from there and have the ninth star added to the flag. Other than that...I like the rays for dawn and that you kept the olive branches and just yeah. Good job condensing the arms into a workable flag.<br><br>Also, oh man, I would love to have a Baron With Flag portrait. That would just increase the awesomeness so much. (Also, at some point I need a baronial coat of arms; they were never updated. Then again, I also have a Plort interlude to finish, and I think I meant to update her wiki page a while back and--yeah, there are things to be done. But now there&#39;s a flag!

            <p>How lovely. Thank you so much! :)<br><br>Re: #1, I like that she&#39;s in armor. Can&#39;t say that&#39;s at all the armor I was picturing, partly because my primary armor ideas come from Tamora Pierce and King Arthur (though not exclusively--it&#39;s just what I reach for automatically). However, looking at the list of places that type of armor was worn? <i>Perfect</i>. It includes the RL equivalent of the area where she trained. I don&#39;t know if that was on purpose or not, but if it wasn&#39;t, I like the coincidence.<br><br>#3...well, she has a short braid because at the point when I wrote that description <i>I</i> had a short braid. I also wanted to separate her from Dawn a little. Of course, if she&#39;s reflecting my current look her hair should be about earlobe length in the back and an inch or so longer in the front, but that&#39;s a development of only a few months ago. The braid works.<br><br>#4: Muaha. Good going :P<br><br>And miscellaneous: I really like the lettering. Of all things to focus on, I know, but...it&#39;s very nice.<br><br>All in all, thanks for doing this!<br><br>~Z</p>

            <p>But I&#39;m not here about the portrait, or about Priestess Scapegrace&#39;s Fun With Flags. I&#39;m here on Armorial College business! Now, about those arms of yours...<br><br>I&#39;m guessing it&#39;s the Alvish shield you&#39;re looking at updating. So... what would you like? The classic upgrade would be to put some kind of point where you have the birds now (moving them, presumably), though there&#39;s nothing actually ruling out a lopsided device (with the points to one side of the birds). You could also do something that comes out on either side of the birds but joins outside them.<br><br>Previous baronnings have, weirdly, tended to introduce plants: we have brambles, olive branches (though I think they were morningstars once), and lotuses. Come to think of it, my secondary points are mallorn leaves... Nesh&#39;s are kudzu leaves... okay, I guess what I&#39;m saying is that you don&#39;t <i>have</i> to use plant life for your extra points, but every single Baron of Plort in history with an Alvish shield has done so.<br><br>So what&#39;ll it be? ^_^<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Baron Huinesoron stood in front of the line of flagpoles, looking up at the banners flapping in the wind. &quot;They&#39;re... alarmingly good,&quot; he admitted.<br><br>Ye Scape-Grace gave him something that can only be described as a leer, but her tone reflected none of it. &quot;Surely this is because the great Spelin Tam-Ara hath guided mine hand,&quot; she declared. &quot;Praise be to the Well-Written Word of Spelin.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Er, yes.&quot; Huinesoron glanced at the Temple Warden&#39;s great hook-headed staff. &quot;Praise be.

Why is Baron Phobos&#39; flag on a spear?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Ha!&quot; Phobos strode in from the westward road. &quot;Just the sort of question I would expect from <i>you</i>. I have a spear because I am a warrior!&quot; The bearded Baron grabbed hold of the flagpole and yanked it from the earth, waving it overhead.<br><br>Baron Neshomeh came scurrying up behind him. &quot;Put it down, dear,&quot; she chided, &quot;you&#39;re going to hit someone.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Quite the picture they make,&quot; Huinesoron murmured as Phobos planted the spear back in the ground. &quot;I guess that answers that.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Strange are the workings of Spelin,&quot; Ye Scape-Grace agreed. &quot;Open thy heart and mind to me, and She will answer all that you might ask.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Right.&quot; Huinesoron pursed his lips. &quot;So... why do we need these flags? We&#39;ve already <i>got</i> coats of arms.&quot;<br><br>&quot;And fair indeed they are, if a trifle overwrought.&quot; Ye Scape-Grace lowered her hood and gazed up at the flags. &quot;But they serve only to identify the knights who bear them, while these can serve as standards for an entire army - or to symbolise a Barony in the halls of Otik.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I&#39;m... not entirely convinced,&quot; Huinesoron admitted. &quot;But they are very good.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Indeed they are!&quot; Sir Hardric, bearing his own shield of the eagle, sword, quill, and die, pushed through the crowd to the front. &quot;And as a faithful convert to the worship of Spelin, I demand more!&quot;<br><br>&quot;More?&quot; Ye Scape-Grace blinked. &quot;Tha says what?&quot;<br><br>&quot;<i>Oui</i>, more!&quot; Sir Hardric turned, arms outspread. &quot;Let every Knight of Plort have a banner to call their own, that they may wave above the battlefields of the League and strike terror into the hearts of the Marizu! And-&quot; He seemed lost for a moment, before rounding on Baron Huinesoron. &quot;And let each and everyone one of us be commemorated in portraiture!&quot; he cried. &quot;For all know the work of Baron Huinesoron, how he has decked the castle formerly known as Retben in artwork of his own making; let him share the skills of his art with all, and not stop until every knighted soul of this isle is remembered.&quot;<br><br>Baron Huinesoron and Ye Scape-Grace shared a look which was, for once, in perfect accord. Huinesoron took a deep breath. &quot;That&#39;s... an interesting idea, Sir Hardric...&quot;<br><br>~<br><br>I&#39;d actually forgotten Ye Scape-Grace had been proclaimed by a certain over-impulsive baron to be the Temple Warden of Spelin - because of her flag-making abilities. This all fitted together <i>amazingly</i> neatly when I remembered that.<br><br>As for portraits: I don&#39;t know what you look like. ;) I can&#39;t even do all the <i>barons</i> - I don&#39;t know what VixenMage or Juliette look like, either. (Technically I have a very old picture of Delta Juliette somewhere - you remember it, Juliette, it&#39;s the one with the rose - but I somehow doubt it&#39;s still accurate all these years later.)<br><br>But you&#39;ll probably get at least a few more <s>before I get bored and wander off to something else</s>.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>As a reward for your labours, you get a full-colour image (with preemptive apologies for being too colour-blind to actually know your hair colour for sure, and thus having to estimate).<br><br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/lbDKqrd.png"><br><br>Fun fact #1: The costume here is drawn directly from <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=310158;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">Ye Scape-Grace&#39;s clerical robes</a>.

It&#39;s the best I could do at this scale for the elaborate embroidery she should have.<br><br>Fun fact #3: If anyone else asks for filigree&#39;d anything, I will not be responsible for my actions. :( I&#39;m worn out on that now.<br><br>Fun fact #4: As a non-baron, Ye Scape-Grace gets a tiny little flag.

            <p>That&#39;s amazing!!! =oD<br><br>I&#39;m sort of flailing around because yes, she <i>would</i> have a smaller flag, just as a proof-of-concept/artisan&#39;s-mark thingy. You know, to prove that she can do it and so forth. Plus, given her connection to Spelin Tam-Ara and how she got the job as Warden in the first place, it&#39;s make sense for that to form a large part of her attire. Almost a secondary symbol of the faith - I feel like the Temple of Spelin now has quite a few weavers of broadcloth and silks in it now, the better to capitalize on the Warden&#39;s unique skillset (and also, y&#39;know, give alms of blankets and good winter clothing to the poor and needy of the Union).<br><br>I also love the very traditional crosier that she has - it actually looks quite a lot like the one from the Shepherd Neame logo, which is super fitting for the real ale nerd. It looks like it could do some serious damage to any Marizu fool enough to come charging in at her... which is all of them, so that&#39;s handy. I get the feeling that the actual crosier-y bit at the top is just a huge lump of carbon steel bent into shape and then brazed, giving it an approximate weight (after some quick and dirty calcs) of about 18.5kg. That&#39;s a hair under 41lb, for anyone watching in black and white or from the US.<br><br>That&#39;s the thing about Ye Scape-Grace - her weapon of choice is hiding in plain sight. =]</p>

            <p>Working down the list... <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vS_MFW1ztKR5rAlM2yLVwRW2jNDhzD7vyH0_umILjP1iJbKYG0_teHSUNijhRprzkXVxNcIH7nWrzEB/pub">the gallery</a> has been updated with this, plus the named version of Nesh.<br><br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/HabRZ6C.jpg"><br><br>Fun fact #1: Baron Iximaz wields the famed sword Zeb and bow Arin; the beasts Charlotte and Saibhir are nowhere to be seen.<br><br>Fun fact #2: Baron Iximaz&#39;s look is <i>not</i> based on the image on the Cyclopaedia page, because that looks far too much like Baron Huinesoron&#39;s outfit! So you get a different cape design.<br><br>Fun fact #3: The theory was that the smaller flag was for practical reasons, since Baron Iximaz is the baron who spends the most time at war. But it could also symbolise the status of Barony Iximaz as the smallest barony.<br><br>Fun fact #4: That hair was a nightmare! For some reason, I just couldn&#39;t get it to look like actual hair - not for ages. Hopefully it came fairly close eventually.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>When it comes to a lot of these flags, I tried to take motifs and colour combinations from the relevant baron&#39;s heraldry that worked together. In the case of Barony Phobos, that was the two field colours, the bend, and the dice reading six; that it came out resembling a Famous Pizza Corporation&#39;s logo was merely a happy accident. Zing&#39;s, meanwhile, came from combining the eight-pointed stars from the top of the field and the central charge of an olive branch with the purple field, while the rays were there to represent dawn. =]<br><br>Yours was actually super hard, bc Flag Maker Jr doesn&#39;t have quills or alembics or leaves and the scaling only goes up to 20x, which meant I couldn&#39;t put a lot of filigree in. I&#39;m really glad you liked it. =]</p>

            <p>A flag <i>shouldn&#39;t</i> be as complicated as a coat of arms; they serve a very different purpose (especially in Plort, where people don&#39;t seem to be using shields for identification on the battlefield anyway...). I also love the fact that mine is the <i>most</i> complicated, because yes, that is absolutely what Baron Me would do.<br><br>I am also perpetually amazed that people are still playing around with this Plort idea at all. ^_^<br><br>hS</p>
