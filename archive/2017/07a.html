This above is a debunking by Snopes.<br><br>But that&#39;s not the point of this post.<br><br>The point is, if you read the original post that Snopes exhibited in their article? <i>It reads like a flippin&#39; bad fanfiction!</i> Complete with horrible typos, weird dialogue, a somewhat OOC H--ler and everything! <i>It&#39;s literally just short World War 2 themed badfic!</i> I suggest you guys read it. You&#39;re going to laugh and/or cringe, depending on what you do with badfic. Maybe we could even do a pretend sporking. That&#39;d be fun.<br><br>Alright, thank you for listening to my rambling.

            <p>The current hosting for T-Board limits us to 10,000 database records (there&#39;s one per post, among other things). We&#39;re currently about halfway to the limit. However, that includes all of the random test junk from when I was showing things off initially and all of the old Other Board from 2008 to 2012. So, at the rate we&#39;re going, in about five years we&#39;ll need to clear off some of the junk and in a bit less than a decade we&#39;ll need to think about some archiving (or finding more suitable hosting). <br><br>So, tl;dr, feel free to use T-Board for RPs and such. The problem is far in the future, and we&#39;ll cross that bridge when we get there. <br><br>- Tomash</p>

            <p>It actually is currently over ten years old. If you&#39;re feeling like checking how old it is, check the Plort page on the wiki, grab the link to the Plort Wiki itself, then check the changing maps of the Baronies and the years said maps represent.

            <p>I find that a lot of OCs in action fanfics are subject to this; does having a large number of techniques and/or use a couple of canon loopholes to have a plethora of abilities really indicate a Mary Sue? I personally think that this is only the case in certain genres of action because the concept of power works differently. However, I see a lot of people hating on characters because said character has a large arsenal of techniques. I feel that this is unfair to a lot of fanfic authors who have characters with a lot of skills without warping or breaking canon, stretching canon perhaps, but definitely not breaking canon. So, I wanted to ask the PPC community for your opinions on the matter.</p>

            <p>I have been reading the original series as well as a couple of other missions. Has there ever been an incident where an agent has been forced to use some non-canonical method of dealing with a sue? I only ask because some of the methods used to subdue a Sue before listing charges seems a bit forced. I don’t know, it just seems a bit un-canonical to be able to subdue Sues from certain continua using canon stuff. I’m not criticizing, it’s all very well written. This is just my personal opinion which is why I am asking.</p>

            <p>The sign of an actual Mary Sue is that they face no real challenge. The plot, the characters, and reality itself is structured to benefit and glorify them, and even if they face an insurmountable enemy, said enemy only exists to make them look good.

            <p>One reason to call &quot;Mary Sue&quot; may be that the OC is assumed to be quite young (teenage self-insert) and cannot plausibly have the twenty years of training canon characters needed to master a similar large arsenal of techniques.<br><br>HG</p>

            <p>Having characters master too many abilities is a bad thing for sure. However, &quot;know&quot; and &quot;can use&quot; is not the same as mastered; assuming the author meant mastered a technique when he says that a character simply knows said technique is fallacious, unless shown in the fanfic that the OC has indeed mastered it, though this is up for interpretation. Also, many people seem to equate number of techniques with power. Although this is usually true in a Magical Girl environment, it isn&#39;t the case in many other settings. </p>

            <p>What a character is <i>supposed</i> to be is an entirely different thing from what a character actually <i>is</i> in a story. Which is an important distinction to make, because delivery of a character is <i>everything</i>. Technicalities about what powers a character has and how they can use them and how skilled they are with them and how many flashing lights those powers can create don&#39;t mean anything when they&#39;re separated from a character, in action, in their story. You can (I mean, within reason, I suppose. There&#39;re some things that just... can&#39;t be done well,) use the bio of a Mary Sue to deliver a good character in a story, and you can use the bio of a well-written character to deliver a Mary Sue. You got to look at things like how the techniques affect or reflect their character, or things about the reason for the character having said technique in the first place. <br><br>A Mary Sue has lots of techniques and powers essentially for bragging rights - you&#39;ll see a million Sues get bestowed heaps of abilities and powers which will get used once to show off and be forgotten, which aren&#39;t shown at all, or which are used but don&#39;t even affect the plot or <i>anything</i>. They&#39;re <i>supposed</i> to be all skilled and have all these techniques and all, and in practice they just look like a sockpuppet being held up by a badficcer who&#39;s surreptitiously saying &#39;Lookit me, I&#39;m real cool!&#39; <br>A well-written character who has lots of techniques and powers will actually have those techniques and powers relevant to them, whether it&#39;s as extensions of their character and backstory and all (be a bit weird if a ninja character couldn&#39;t be sneaky or any such,) or whether those techniques and powers will actually contribute to the story at hand. It can go a lot of ways, from the ninjafellow using his sneaking to bypass some obstacle, or maybe he gets all angsty about his sneaking because his love interest has an unnecessary hatred towards sneaky things. However it&#39;s done, a well-written character&#39;s skills are directly relevant to them and their plot, and if you took away said well-written character&#39;s skills, they would be losing important aspects of their character. If you took away a Mary Sue&#39;s skills, they would be losing annoying bragging rights. And of course, the Mary Sue and the ninjafellow could very easily have the exact same skills and techniques and bio - it all comes down to how it&#39;s delivered in the story. <br><br>There <i>is</i> a bit of a problem with large numbers of techniques generally being associated with Mary Sue types. It, once more, goes down to the issue of how the techniques relate to the character and why they&#39;re there. An interesting character generally doesn&#39;t <i>need</i> that many skills or techniques to be interesting. Sometimes it&#39;s even better to have less, to put emphasis on the ones they already got. Meanwhile, a Sue, which has no interest in any of that kind of stuff, can stuff themselves with as few or as many techniques as they want, because the techniques, for all purposes, essentially don&#39;t exist. <br><br>So, lots of techniques does not equal Sue. It might imply a Sue, it might be a symptom of a Sue, but it doesn&#39;t equal a Sue. Don&#39;t get me wrong - I will be very suspicious of a character with heaps of skills as opposed to one with a more moderate amount. And I do not think that I am incorrect in being so. But, nah, doesn&#39;t outright indicate one, I don&#39;t think. </p>

            <p>I agree with what you said, but I feel like there should be a distinction made between gadget based characters and ability based characters. Gadget based characters like spec ops soldiers or batman have external abilities. It&#39;s not exactly practical for soldiers to carry every single piece of military hardware available to them, they would only bring what is practical and relevant to the mission. So I think in CoD, this is sort of justified. Of course, if it was an ability based character, doing the same thing isn&#39;t good writing unless their powers are the &quot;bag of tricks&quot; type.</p>

            <p>So basically what you are saying it that having a somewhat large moveset that does not defy canon is fine if it is used in the story, not plot breaking, and relevant? Would you consider it a decrease in character relevance if some techniques overlapped in usage (such as a character having both a fire fist and lightning fist attack)? </p>

            <p>You can&#39;t look at a list of powers and abilities a character has and use that, and that alone, to determine if they&#39;re poorly written or not. It&#39;s a bit of a cliche to say, perhaps, but the importance is less about <i>what</i> the powers are and more about the <i>how</i> and <i>why</i> of them. Why does your character have fire and lightning fist? Is it related to their character development or the plot at all? Would they be affected negatively if you took those powers away? I was talking to Mikel on the Discord thingy and he mentioned Kakashi as an example - his character is that of a prodigy and (as far as I am aware) a sort of mentor-teacher type. It would, for his character development and his role in the plot, make absolutely no <i>sense</i> if you took his techniques and all away. <br><br>You can&#39;t judge the powers on their own merits, essentially - there is nothing inherently wrong with a character having both a fire and a lightning fist, just as there is nothing inherently wrong with a character having omnipotence or a character being entirely made of jellybeans. When you&#39;re just looking at a character&#39;s powers, separated from an actual story or their character development, you&#39;re looking at a <i>concept,</i> which really can&#39;t be judged at all. It all depends on why your fellow has the fire and lightning fists and what role they have in the story and to the character. </p>

            <p>I only asked if you would consider redundant abilites bad even if it is plot relevant. So I will take that as a no. Don&#39;t get me wrong, I don&#39;t judge a character until I read the story; in fact, I am perfectly fine with having a lot of abilities, so long as it is consistent with canon and the character. We are actually in agreement here.</p>

            <p>First, I&#39;m with everyone else: there&#39;s no way I&#39;m comfortable with Bram returning any earlier than September. We are not marital or any other kind of therapy. If Bram needs that kind of support, she should seek it through appropriate channels.<br><br>Second, during my Board vacation, I still kept an eye on the wiki off and on, and Bram has been fairly active over there under the name TooPurple. As I understand it, when someone is banned, they&#39;re banned from <i>all</i> PPC community spaces, which includes the wiki. Shall I block them, or was staying off the wiki somehow not a condition of this ban? Please refresh my memory, it&#39;s been a while.<br><br>Also, are we lacking in wiki admins with the power to block people?<br><br>~Neshomeh<br><br>P.S. Hi, I&#39;m back!

            <p>So, looking back, Bram said, roughly &quot;Please block me for a while for my own good while I work on brain stuff&quot;, and we went &quot;Sure! You&#39;ll be welcome back once there&#39;s been some work on brain stuff because we just aren&#39;t good for each other right now.&quot;.<br><br>Now, even though people were avoiding the word &quot;ban&quot; there (because it&#39;s not like we were imposing any sort of penalty), this situation is, in my view, isomorphic to a temporary and indefinite ban. Bans have historically applied to all PPC community spaces unless otherwise specified (for example, Luigifan18, who only got a wiki block, IIRC), and I don&#39;t see anything in the discussion that implies this situation is different.<br><br>Furthermore, the &quot;stay away from PPC spaces in order to get better&quot; thing is probably not helped by a barrage of wiki editing. <br><br>So, it sort of feels like a wiki block might be something we should do. However, if we&#39;re looking at <i>good</i> wiki editing (useful typo fixes, etc.), it seems a bit odd to fire off the blocks. That doesn&#39;t, I think, outweigh the case for a block though, so, on balance, we should probably do the thing.<br><br>Re: admins, what do they do other than block people that &quot;normal&quot; users can&#39;t do? I don&#39;t quite remember how Mediawiki works. (If it&#39;s just blocking folks, then that happens so rarely that two active people should be plenty.)<br><br>- Tomash<br><br>(P.S.: Welcome back!

Unless there are any objections in the next 24 hours, I&#39;ll go ahead and do that tomorrow.<br><br>As for wiki admins and other user levels, there&#39;s a guide <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Help:User_access_levels">here</a>, but admin-level users (a.k.a. sysops) basically have semi-phenomenal, nearly cosmic power as far as the wiki is concerned. An admin has access to the top-level functions of the wiki, including but not limited to CSS, deleting and undeleting pages, and blocking IPs and users. Current sysops are:<br><br>- JulyFlame (wiki creator)<br>- Huinesoron<br>- Araeph<br>- Trojie<br>- Laburnum<br>- Sedri<br>- Tawaki<br>- VixenMage<br>- Aster Corbett<br>- Delta Juliette (under Techno-Dann)<br>- doctorlit<br>- Me<br>- Also dummy accounts for the Sunflower Official and the Marquis de Sod, which I think most of us had access to at some point. They mainly just exist for, e.g., the welcome message for new accounts.<br><br>So, that&#39;s about four admins who can be considered generally active, I think: me, hS, doc, and Delta J (whom I&#39;d be happy to grant admin status under a new account, if she makes one).<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

Let the record show that there are several reasons it is not cool to claim an entire canon&#39;s worth of fics on a fanfiction site:<br><br>1. Basic politeness. It&#39;s not fair to unilaterally exclude other people from sporking Sues in the LoK section if they want to.<br><br>2. Thirty-plus claims at once is outlandish and almost certainly unrealistic, given the tiny percentage of people who even reach TOS&#39;s 26 missions. That&#39;s not even asking whether she intends to spork fics from other continua at the same time.<br><br>3. There are, in fact, <b>927</b> English-language fics in the LoK section at the time of this post, and the claim as stated is not just 30+ fics, but also &quot;everything LOK on fanfiction.net&quot; barring some exclusions. Assuming generously that the exclusions eliminate roughly half that number, that&#39;s still over 400 fics. They can&#39;t ALL be mission-worthy, and even if they were, sporking them all is definitely impossible for one person.<br><br>4. It&#39;s hardly even necessary. Given the diversity of interests in today&#39;s PPC, there is almost zero danger of anyone taking a fic another person wants, let alone thirty-plus. There&#39;s no reason to stake out anything at all unless you really have your heart set on it for story reasons or whatever—and even then, you have to make good on your claim(s) eventually or give it/them up. See above comments about the outlandishness and unreality of thirty-odd claims, let alone hundreds.<br><br>5. Just in case it didn&#39;t take the first time, <i>basic politeness</i>.

            <p>I think that September, at the very least, is the soonest I&#39;m willing to change my mind. Part of this is because, as others have said, we are people who laugh at bad fanfiction and praise the good, not therapists, and I really don&#39;t see how coming back here in order to laugh at fanfiction is going to help a marriage. Part of this is because, as far as I have seen, which, admittedly, is not far, Bram usually feels very strongly on a position at any given time, but these positions can change. As someone who has all the consistency of a d1000000, I think that Bram not only needs to spend some time away from the PPC, but some time not thinking about the PPC. I know that Calliope isn&#39;t the only one Bram has contacted, asking to be let back into the Discord and/or the Board, which, to my mind, indicates that even while they have not been posting, they have been thinking about the Board, which isn&#39;t going to help with purely rational decisions. For myself, at least, when I feel particularly strongly on something, I have been making an effort to take in everything and let my emotions get blown about like a kite in a hurricane, walk away, do something else for a long while, come back, be blown about again, and walk away again, continuing this process several times until I&#39;ve exhausted my capacity for violent emotion and can actually get logic and emotion to work together like they&#39;re supposed to. To me, it sounds like Bram has spent more time on running through the different emotional areas without taking the time to back away and truly not think about the PPC.<br><br>To sum it up, I do not think Bram should be allowed back into the Discord chat or the Board, both because it seems they would be looking for emotional assistance of a kind that we are not equipped to give, and because I feel they haven&#39;t distanced and distracted themselves enough mentally from the Board and their feelings about both it and everyone here to be able to reach a purely rational decision.</p>

            <p>... I&#39;m pretty sure it&#39;s all incorrect. The various gender-neutral pronoun sets that have been developed don&#39;t technically exist as actual words, and &#39;they/them/their&#39; is exclusively for groups of people.

            <p>&quot;They&quot; has been used as a singular, general-neutral pronoun for hundreds of years. According to the OED, this is acceptable usage of the word, and in practice it was only prohibited by Victorian schoolteachers, who instead mandated the usage of &quot;him&quot; as a gender-neutral pronoun.

            <p>It&#39;s one of the various forms of third-person, gender-neutral pronouns that people use when someone either A) is neither male nor female, or B) they do not know someone&#39;s gender and don&#39;t want to assume.

            <p>Bram is bad for the PPC and the reverse is equally true.

            <p>While I do feel bad for Bram, we&#39;ve already mentioned that the Boarders are not therapists. Given that Bram apparently wants to rejoin because of the issues in their personal life, I feel that Bram wants to use us that way, and I don&#39;t think that will end well. </p>

            <p>I can&#39;t quite make all my reasons for that vote coherent, but I&#39;ll give some of them.<br><br>I&#39;ve been talking with Bram for a while now. During those discussions, I was asked to make a post requesting her return. I explained to her why making a post like that (such as this one) wouldn&#39;t work and would be a bad idea in general (among other things, it makes her earlier departure look insincere).<br><br>Yet, despite that advice, which (I&#39;ve been reassured) made sense and was understood, this thread is up on the Board. This means that, at this time, post-return mentorship might not actually work very well.<br><br>This, plus a general feeling that the self-improvement that Bram left to go do hasn&#39;t progressed as much as we&#39;d like, leads me to suggest that we re-open this discussion in a few months at the earliest.<br><br>- Tomash</p>

            <p>But I have to disagree with you. I think it&#39;s straight-up too soon, and my conversations with Bram in the recent and not-so recent past make me think that e would not be helped by returning to the community.<br><br>And, honestly? If someone isn&#39;t stable enough that being excluded from a community that hurt them (from their perspective) is enough to cause serious issues? They need to be working on stability rather than getting back into the community that hurt them. The part where they also hurt people in this community only compounds that fact.<br><br>Bottom line is, from where I&#39;m sitting (and from where a few others I&#39;ve talked to who weren&#39;t comfortable speaking up directly), this really strikes me as being too soon, and all around a bad idea.<br><br>When they do return, I would also like to suggest some pretty strong guardrails - a mentor, or perhaps multiple mentors, with the authority to say &quot;stop this conversation&quot; on pain of kicking/banning if she doesn&#39;t. I think that&#39;s going to be necessary to avoid spiralling misunderstandings of the sort that have caused some of the problems in the past.</p>

            <p>Hi! I go by Feenie/Feeni3, pronouns are she/her/hers, I&#39;m 20 years old, and I write fanfiction. Very slowly. I hope I&#39;m doing this right, I&#39;ve never used a forum system like this before.<br><br>I found PPC while browsing the internet, looking for more stuff like Mystery Science Theater 3000 either in terms of riffing bad material or, and I stumbled upon a mission and enjoyed it thoroughly. I am going to go and read the original series once I have the time and energy, of course.<br><br>The only question I have off the top of my head, while I&#39;m typing this out, is how do you decide what your agent/agents&#39; canon is? Like do they need to be from badfics you wrote when you were younger, or something else? I am interested in making two of my long-time characters into agents, but I&#39;m also hesitant because they&#39;re near and dear to my heart and am...afraid of exposing them to badfic.<br><br>Also, feel free to ask me for clarification on anything I say if I come off as unclear. I fully realize sometimes I just...mangle the english language when speaking.</p>

            <p>Ey there! I&#39;m Twistey, and I write both fanfic and (tons and tons of) original worlds. We&#39;ll get to my newbie gift for you at the bottom of this post.<br><br>That&#39;s pretty cool that you&#39;re already familiar with MST stuff - it&#39;s gotten somewhat obscure in these times. Given how you enjoy the missions and whatnot, you seem to be a good addition.<br><br>About the agents, no, they don&#39;t need to be from badfic you wrote! Sometimes we recruit background characters from badfic other people wrote, sometimes we even recruit Sues or borderline Sues (but only when a long list of conditions are met), many agents come from World One (aka IRL), and there are even some that come from goodfic! And about your characters becoming agents, you (the writer) choose which badfics your agents spork, so you can avoid NSFW or violent missions, or whatever you&#39;re uneasy about. Also, most of the time, PPC technology and training will protect the agents from being dead or worse, so they&#39;ll be safe in most cases. If you&#39;re interested, we can every so often exchange tips from olderbies about creating agents as we go through the process - I myself am also currently converting a few of my beloved characters and finally making my first agents. Lovely coincidence, eh?<br><br>And finally, about the newbie gift, I have several souvenirs and replicas from the iD Software fandom for you to pick from. Here&#39;s the list:<br> - Bunch of blue bricks found exclusively in castles from Wolfenstein 3D<br> - Bunch of used syringes from Wolfenstein 3D (may contain residue from the zombifying chemical, who knows)<br> - Replica Spear of Destiny, also from Wolfenstein 3D<br> - Replica &quot;Call Apogee Say Aardwolf&quot; sign from Wolfenstein 3D<br> - A very flat flamethrower<br> - A Supercharge item from Doom (it&#39;s a health item.)<br> - An Armor Bonus item from Doom<br> - Replica of Commander Keen&#39;s homemade spaceship<br> - And any powerup from the first Quake game.<br><br>Sorry if this overwhelms you. Hope to hear the reply!<br><br>-Twistey</p>

She doesn&#39;t have any powers as per Transistor canon, just her Selections (they&#39;re like college majors, but for life): Mixology and Bartending.<br><br>Personality-wise, she starts out even-tempered and somewhat spoiled. When Cloudbank (Transistor&#39;s setting) can give you anything you want, you tend to not understand that weather is actually not as controlled as you thought it was and buildings don&#39;t change on a whim. Eventually she will develop into a more hot-tempered character, being compulsive and justice-hungry compared to her partner.<br><br>Nocturne is a human singer from...I&#39;m not entirely sure yet. Tentatively, it&#39;s the world of Xenosaga, but I&#39;m tempted to change it to something else. She&#39;s been at PPC for 8 months longer than Soleil, and discovered her wandering around Rudi&#39;s. Nocturne figured she could get away by just explaining the PPC to her and sending her off to wherever she needed to go, but then Hyacinth said &quot;Nah, you two are sticking together.&quot; And thus, Nocturne reluctantly considers herself Soleil&#39;s mentor.<br><br>Personality-wise, she starts out cold and snarky. She puts on a facade to make herself appear nice and sweet to those around her...but she finds it hard to be nice to people. As time passes, she softens up and starts to try to befriend people, and especially grows attached to Soleil. What doesn&#39;t change is her having to hold back Soleil whenever she gets particularly incensed at a fic, either pre- or post-character development.<br><br>...that got super long, I&#39;m sorry.</p>

            <p>For Soleil: Is this Transistor the game, or some other Transistor I don&#39;t know about? I&#39;m pretty interested. I like how her personality develops in a way that might actually be considered negative - that&#39;s an interesting twist on character development. I also like how you pointed out how someone from Cloudbank would react to being in a (mostly) World One-like setting.<br><br>For Nocturne: That&#39;s an interesting pairing. I also like the character development there as well. Asking oldbies: Can a character who is an agent have joined the PPC in a time before they were actually put in, or do they have to be in the same timeframe as when their W1 writers put them in?<br><br>For both: Remember that you shouldn&#39;t try to force character development to happen too fast. Usually a lot of us start with one character concept, and then the things that happen to the agents while on missions and in interludes are the spur for character development. It&#39;s like a role-play: If you expect your character to do X Y and Z, you may end up railroading stuff and forcing it in. Let the missions and badfics take the wheel so it feels natural.<br><br>-Twistey</p>

            <p>(Oh wait! What department are your two in?)<br><br>Aside from the two who aren&#39;t going to be agents but function similarly (the &quot;Fanfiction&#39;s Hired Mercenaries&quot; that I came up with while I was still worried about my parents somehow finding out I&#39;m on here), here are some short descriptions of my pending characters.<br><br>This quartet consists of the three Callahan siblings (Erika, Amber, and Connor, from oldest to youngest) and their good friend Miriam Almstedt. Amber and Miriam are partners in the Department of Geographical Aberrations, Erika is currently partnerless in the Department of Angst, and Connor is in the Department of Mary Sue Experiments and Research, which is a non-action department. The three girls in the group all have some sort of powers (although Erika and Miriam both got theirs accidentally), which they use to their advantage while on missions. The four of them have a pretty close bond, and always look out for one another. There is a bit of a personality contrast between the girly-girl Miriam and the tomboyish Amber, which leads to a couple arguments every now and then, but overall, they work well together. Erika is rather sarcastic and uses that as a strategy to give angsty characters a reality check, and Connor, lacking powers, dedicates himself to STEM disciplines and academics. Let me know if I said enough about them or if you have any questions!<br><br>-Twistey</p>

            <p>Miriam can turn into a fox and control gravity to some extent (only one object at a time, though), Erika can temporarily turn into a ghost of some sort (but it takes a lot of concentration to make it activate when she wants it to, and it turns on automatically whenever she is overcome with strong emotion), and Amber is essentially an Earthbender with a little less versatility (I decided that there were a few of those uses that she doesn&#39;t need.) That&#39;s why I put Miriam and Amber together in DOGA - they&#39;d be a great help to the department because of their powers.

            <p>Yeah... they used to be a lot more overpowered, since I made them for an RP group called Mistclan (and other stuff in the same verse), and Amber&#39;s name was Sakura but called herself Mountaineer, and Amber/Sakura/Mountaineer also had a magical pet wolf and a giant magical pet wolf and an alternate form made of stone (not my fault, they were gifts from other Mistclan kids) and Miriam was pretty much a humanization of FN@F&#39;s Mangle, and Connor and Erika looked a lot different than they do now. Luckily, however, it was easy to strip them down and revamp them into agent-quality characters, since they were agent-quality in essence, they just had too many extra frills and a bunch of bad details. Details can make or break a character, but the core parts of them are what makes them salvageable. Hooray for getting really deep into character creation as I am wont to do! :P<br><br>-Twistey</p>

            <p>If your characters are afraid, you probably shouldn’t expose them to badfic. Or perhaps it might be fun to write and read about them having to deal with it anyway. But then you need a good backstory about how they got into the PPC and why they don’t just run away.<br><br>One of the agents I’ve been talking about for years is a player character I once created in <i>World of Warcraft</i>. Since &quot;protect and heal the world and all its natural inhabitants&quot; is what I believe WoW druids do, and this may easily be transformed into &quot;protect and heal all word worlds and their natural inhabitants – intruders beware&quot;, she is predestined to be an assassin in the DMS (and there is space for character development, because she will need to learn that not all OC’s are bad). I actually made the decision the other way round: realizing that I already had a prospective agent at hand, I hesitantly started to think about whether I might like to write PPC stories.<br><br>My other agent is a blatant self-insert. Thus, his home canon is what we call &quot;World One&quot;, the AU version of real life where it is actually possible to be sucked into a computer, be trapped in that tiny corner of the internet where the PPC exists, and meet a fictional character you created.<br><br>About your newbie gift – I might just pretend that it is the advice you got.

            <p>Did you have any particular tabletops in mind? I&#39;ve been thinking, after I finish up my current campaign (in which Granz is the only player), of starting up a <i>Call of Cthulhu</i> campaign in the PPC. We also have, at this point, two <i>Mutants and Masterminds</i> campaigns, a <i>Pokemon Trainers United</i> campaign, and a <i>Warhammer40K Dark Heresy</i> campaign at present. And those are just what I know of.</p>

            <p>Which version of D&amp;D would you want to play most, if you had the chance? The only one I&#39;m familiar with, really, is 4E, but that group is transitioning to 5E because it&#39;s a massively overinflated group and combat takes f o r e v e r as a result.</p>

            <p>I think it&#39;s only one M&amp;M game at this point. Mine is pretty much dead. :P Although, now that you mention it, there may, in the future, eventually be a D&amp;D campaigns springing into existence, since Alleb mentioned considering running one relatively far in the future, although who knows if it&#39;ll happen, and if it does, how long in the future it will actually be. There&#39;s also an Adeptus Evangelion game that is currently on pause before the episode has actually begun, due to one of our players actually having a life. <strike>Unlike me.</strike></p>

            <p>When you say Pokémon, do you mean the games, anime, manga, or a combination of them? I have a Luxray agent from a Nuzlocke run I did, so I&#39;m definitely a games fan. <br><br>Also, I <i>love</i> Steven Universe! Tried getting into Star because I heard the two were similar, but it just seemed too... weird. I dunno. About where would you say the show gets really good? (Because it took my college roommate showing me later episodes of SU before I decided to give it a second chance, I thought I&#39;d do the same for Star.)</p>

            <p>Mostly the games. Used to love the anime when I was younger, not as much, and I intend to read the manga one day. Sun and Moon is definitely my favorite game thus far, though I have a soft spot for the Mystery Dungeon spinoffs. And that&#39;s cool!<br><br>I&#39;d say it starts getting good and serious around Mewnipendence Day, where it starts exploring the relationship between Mewnans and Monsters. In my opinion, it really gets good around Season 2 when character development kicks in for Star&#39;s mom Moon and Ludo. It does have the drawback SU has in that if you miss one plot-critical episode, you might be lost later in the series, though.</p>

            <p>Another notes-based review from dog week.  Sorry.<br><br>Haven&#39;t read the Saga yet, but . . . are Meyerpires seriously <i>this</i> indestructible?  Sheesh.<br><br>So, to me, the theme of this mission is the comparison of the behaviors between the agents and the Sue and her Harry.  Both pairs are present in the Wizarding World, a fantasy setting, and both in a romantic relationship.  The fic romance is filled with forced and awkward dialogue, and weighed down by the Sue&#39;s insistence on being much more magical and special than the other wizards around her by virtue of being a space princess wizard of a, let&#39;s say, critically endangered species/race/what really does all that make her.  The agents, on the other hand, are a witch werewolf and a vampire, but still interact like recognizable human beings; in contrast to the fantasy setting they&#39;re present in, their primary bonding conversation is about making whistling noises through blades of grass, with other topics being piercings and <i>Pokémon</i> jokes.  You did an excellent job of showing the overly grand and awkward fic romance for how artificial it is, not by quoting the fic, mocking it, and charging the Sue, but by presenting a much more simple and natural alternative within your own writing.<br><br>As a small addition to the above, I especially liked your inclusion of the scene where Ix relates to Sue&#39;d Harry&#39;s desire to &quot;fall on his knees and praise&quot; a love interest.  It&#39;s a good reminder that some situations do call for what we tend to generalize as purple prose, when they&#39;re used in appropriate amounts, and to describe things that are difficult to explain, like romantic feelings.<br><br>One typo: &quot;Harry ambled right past Ron and Hermione without so much a second glance . . .&quot; is missing the &quot;as.&quot;<br><br>—doctorlit sometimes falls on his knees before his work lunch, but that&#39;s less worship and more low blood sugar</p>

            <p>Uh, yeah, let&#39;s go with that very nice analysis rather than &quot;I just wanted to focus on the agents rather than the fic because so many of my missions are repetitive and badfic is all the same&quot;.

            <p>Except now it&#39;s not new because of the other one whoopsie! <br>I did enjoy it, and took a buncha notes as I went through it. Hooopefully they&#39;ll be useful? <br><br><br>“Can you stop whining for five seconds?” Charlotte muttered.<br>- Harry really hadn’t whined that much, until that one time in the story! If he did, then it wasn’t entirely shown in the mission, y’know? Either way, looks a bit early for her to get annoyed! <br> - The mention of Romania was bloody good, though - pointing out issues in characterisation, what the proper problem is, showing the agents know enough to know how it ought to be <br><br><br>‘We’ve still got badfic from the 1800s’<br>- What a horrendous clerical nightmare the PPC bureaucracy must be. Good grief. <br><br><br>‘The girl had long shiny jet-black hair. Her skin was so pale, but she still had a bit of pink on her cheeks. Her outfit was pretty tight. She was wearing black pants and a gray sleeveless shirt with a small black jacket to go with it. She was slim and looked really fit. Really fit. Harry realized that he had been staring at her.’<br>- So this entire bit is sort of, grabbed from the fic. It’s quite a large section, too. There was an opportunity to make her appearance appear, rather, from the agent’s perspective, instead? - it’s not necessarily wrong that that didn’t happen, but it would have been interesting to see, as opposed to just the section from the fic! <br><br><br>‘shoving a finger in her mouth’ - You do these a lot - little small sort of gestures, that break up the dialogue and characterise and all. They’re very good and they’re great details, in general. I should, er, probably work on doing them better, myself. <br>- ‘steadying Ix against a sudden timeskip.’ - and that, too! That one’s even better, a little thing that sort of, sums up their relationship and all - it is very clear to see that they’re, y’know, in love, even without pointing that out<br><br><br>The blade of grass part was adorable - little sort of slice of life bit, there. Sort of, going into their relationship and all, while also setting up their individual characters, rounding them out. And it was not cheesy or any such! <br><br><br>‘feeble whine’ - aw, poor thing. Good wording, there! <br><br><br>Love the subplot of their relationship sort of, advancing, all the slice of life bits - elevates it over just a mission where they go in and pointlessly kill stuff, y’know? There’s stuff to it, beyond the mission<br><br><br>‘the agents fell to the ground as the scene shot forward to the staircases’<br>- I sort of had to reread the paragraph, having missed this particular line! Bit of an issue, there - the description’s a bit bland, a bit limited. It’s just… they just fell, y’know? Could have them go ‘clonk’ or go &#39;ow&#39; or some more description of it, y’know? Especially being a very sort of, actiony bit - it blends in with the rest of the paragraph, and probably shouldn’t<br><br><br>‘A flick of his wand sent ropes tying themselves around the Sue, and she fell over with an indignant screech’<br>- Bloody love how underwhelming it is - really captures the problems with a Sue faced with, y’know, reality - that difference, as mentioned in the story, between power and skill<br><br><br>Very classic sort of mission, but it was kept from being generic, or from mindlessly following the mission procedure stuff with the little bits of Charlotte and Ix’s relationship. That’s what makes a good spinoff! The focus on the agents, because while everybody has to follow mission procedure, it’s the agents that are unique to you. And of course, it was very well done - it felt very sort of, slice-of-lifey, if that’s a word. The way their relationship builds, and shows the interplay between their two distinct characters, as opposed to them being a Twilight-esque singular mass is real bloody well done, indeed! It doesn’t feel fake or forced or cheesy or anything. <br>Enjoyable stuff! <br><br>Also, that Sue was <i>incredible</i>. Chinky. Bloody <i>chinky</i>. Good grief. </p>

            <p>I&#39;ll make sure to keep them in mind while working on the next one.<br><br>The slice-of-life feel is good! It&#39;s what I was aiming for—after doing so many missions, it gets boring following the routine, so I&#39;ve been trying to make a point on focusing on the agents&#39; interactions as they go through the fic, rather than focusing on how bad the fic is (unless it&#39;s <i>spectacularly</i> bad), since I could probably make a drinking game out of all the repeated cliches I&#39;ve seen.<br><br>I&#39;m glad people are enjoying the kill point; that was honestly the part I was worried about the most for this one.</p>

            <p>One would expect an ESAS mission, with a very specifically overpowered Sue to focus on the Sue - focus on the problems of dealing with an overpowered Sue, perhaps with lots of fight scenes and blood and maybe an explosion and a backflip or two. <br>But the fact that you <i>didn&#39;t</i> focus on that sort of shows where you wanted to focus with the mission - on the agents, over the badfic itself.

            <p>But I did. ^<em>^;<br><br>And I&#39;m glad I did! Getting back into the saddle is great, and this was a nice return mission. The interactions between Ix and Charlotte are cute, and there were some pretty good gags in there. I think my favorites were Harry interrupting their kiss with &quot;.&quot;, and &quot;Me caveman. You sexy.&quot; I had to work hard not to laugh out loud at that one. Sometimes the low-hanging fruit is the best fruit, especially since you spiced it up with Ix&#39;s genderfluidity. ^</em>^<br><br>I have some nitpicks for you; sorry if anyone else has pointed them out already, but I haven&#39;t looked at any other reviews.<br><br>- Watch out for often repeated emotes like sighing and eye-rolling. It might just be me, but I notice when the same ones pop up within a few paragraphs of each other.<br><br>- <i>“And the time Supergirl crushed <u>your</u> to rubble?”</i><br><br>-- Either this should be &quot;you&quot; or there&#39;s a word missing.<br><br>- <i><u>Sue</u> enough, no sooner had Harry reached the park than he was literally running into her.</i><br><br>-- Should probably be &quot;sure,&quot; though it&#39;s so apt you might just keep it. *g*<br><br>- <i>“Jeez, you’d think by now people treating him decently wouldn’t be such a <u>mind blowing</u> experience.”</i><br><br>-- Should be hyphenated: mind-blowing.<br><br>- <i>“<u>MInd</u> slave?” Ix muttered.</i><br><br>-- &quot;Mind&quot;, unless &quot;MInd&quot; with a capital <i>I</i> means something I don&#39;t get.<br><br>- Should PPC agents be able to find an empty train compartment to hide in? Don&#39;t Harry &amp; co. always have trouble finding an empty one?<br><br>- <i>Harry ambled right past Ron and Hermione without so much a second glance, lost in <u>thought</u> of the Sue.</i><br><br>-- &quot;Thoughts&quot; plural, probably. If he&#39;s stuck on a single thought, that might be worth elaborating on for a joke. {= )<br><br>- <i>Charlotte didn’t look entirely convinced, but she nodded and took a peek at the Words, placing a quick kiss <u>to</u> Ix’s temple.</i><br><br>-- I&#39;d use &quot;on&quot;.<br><br>- <i>“This one was more trigger-happy than we’re used <u>to,</u> most just like to stand there while we read the charge list.”</i><br><br>-- The comma should be a semicolon, linking two independent clauses.<br><br>Not a nitpick: <i>Ordeith</i>?! That name rang a bell when I read it, so I looked it up and it turns out it&#39;s one of the names of <a href="http://wot.wikia.com/wiki/Padan_Fain">this recurring villain</a> from the <i>Wheel of Time</i> series. Good grief, right? I&#39;m surprised I couldn&#39;t turn up anything on Kairia, since every other &quot;original&quot; aspect of the fic is stolen.

I&#39;ll get right on that.<br><br>My reasoning with agents always being able to find an empty compartment is that the Word World is pretty empty whenever the Sue doesn&#39;t acknowledge the existence of other characters; anything not directly related to her or her fic is up for grabs. :)<br><br>Thanks for the review!</p>

            <p>(I am literally swapping between reading the mission for the first time and writing notes in this post. Apologies in advance for incoherency.)<br><br>- First off, I&#39;m liking the opening scene<br>- Even more specifically, the first three paragraphs do a good job of setting things up mental-image wise<br>- Lotte, I agree with Ix here. Nearly-disintegrated fabric that used to be clothes doesn&#39;t count. Put some actual clothes on<br>- Ix an Lotte arguing and teasing each other is funny (and a bit cute)<br>- Took me a reread to figure out that Lotte hadn&#39;t seen Ix with his clothes off, but that could just be me<br>- Back-to-back missions is rude, but typical of the Flowers.<br>- Polly appears to be a cute kitty<br>- &quot;Gotta up the word count somehow&quot;. Good line.<br>- Ix, I also don&#39;t like this already<br>- &quot;Badfic from the 1800s&quot;. Did that happen? Is that going to happen?<br>- In general, the snarky comments are snarky and well-executed<br>- Harry not wanting to leave Privet Drive seems like the right place for a CAD explosion<br>- Technician Tomash would like to blame all the CAD explosions on a horrible codebase that noone understands anymore, since anyone who knew how anything worked either retired or went insane. The Hornbeam refuses to authorize the budget and time to rewrite everything.<br>- I&#39;m also not particularly inclined to believe that Author&#39;s Note, Ix<br>- Ix and Lotte doing the grass-buzzing thing is a really nice scene<br>- A slow-clap seems like the right reaction to &quot;.&quot;<br>- Heh. The Pokemon joke (and followup) is funny<br>- &quot;Me caveman. You sexy.&quot; is a good joke. The scene after it is made of feels<br>- &quot;<i>Not that I wouldn&#39;t be used to it</i>&quot; (and follow-up) Ow.<br>- Ix following the directions of the fic w.r.t all the boys was funny<br>- Hiding behind a sofa seems like a perfectly good place to explore unfamiliar bodily functions :P<br>- I&#39;d forgotten Lotte was scared of spiders. Well-shown there.<br>- &quot;I thought we were in a <i>Harry Potter</i> fic, not <i>Doctor Who</i>&quot; was a good line<br>- Ix seems to be very good at shrugging<br>- [standard mission stuff, being annoyed at the Sue, etc., is standard]<br>- Ix did some good spellwork there. Not what I was expecting to happen, in some sense.<br>- Ix has a good meta-point about Sues standing there for the charge list.<br>- The ending scene is nice (is all I can say)<br>- And I liked the closing lines<br><br>General thoughts:<br>- The mission feels rather TOS-esque, which is, as far as I&#39;m concerned, a good thing.<br>- There&#39;s a good balance of snarking at the fic, agent interactions, and misc. funny stuff<br>- Ix and Lotte relationship stuff is good reading<br>- This was also in a good spot length-wise, I&#39;d say. It gives a good sense of how bad the fic is without beating me over the head with it.<br><br>- Tomash</p>

            <p>So, like I said to Skarm a couple weeks back, I&#39;m jumping back into reading current spin-offs mid-season, so if there&#39;s anything I&#39;m confused by that&#39;s due to not keeping up, just ignore that.<br><br>I&#39;m also still catching up on internet stuff from that dog-sitting adventure and a schedule change last week, so this review is based on notes I took while reading it last week.  I&#39;m sorry for the stale review, but time and sleep haven&#39;t been kind to me this week . . . I do plan on hitting your other two missions you&#39;ve got on the front page, as well, though it may not all be today.<br><br>I&#39;m embarrassed to admit, I didn&#39;t get the pun in the mission title at first glance.  I had a vague inkling that there was a <i>real</i> word that sounded like &quot;fauxpilot,&quot; but I couldn&#39;t quite pull it out of my brain. Then I saw the fic&#39;s original title in the author note, and figured it out.  I blame the sleep deprivation . . . anyway, this was a long-winded way of saying that your title is an excellent and clever pun.<br><br>I love that you have the Aviator and Zeb using a TARDIS as an RC.  Aside from the fact that it makes sense for the Aviator&#39;s history, I like that it serves as a callback to the invasion, when the TARDIS distribution got dropped afterwards by pretty much everyone but Tawaki.  I like seeing another, newer writer picking up on details from the PPC setting&#39;s past.<br><br>I like how you handled the lack-of-ending-puntuation issue.  Quoting a bunch of paragraphs would have been clunky, so presenting it up-front through your own prose was a much better choice.  I also like your explanation that it causes the world to slowly blend together bit by bit, since the &quot;separations&quot; between events and character dialogue are missing.  My one cmomplaint on this regard is that you pretty much drop that detail after those opening paragraphs.  To be fair, though, the Sue was doing enough throughout the fic that it was probably better to focus on him.<br><br>I really, really love that you&#39;ve got two characters with PTSD-esque reactions to explosions, and you expose them to explosions, but then, rather than turning it into a big, dramatic thing, you let it become these really sweet, quiet moments of support between the characters.  Very well done!<br><br>One thing I think you could have done a bit more is explain the canflict between Overwatch and Talon.  This is the first <i>Overwatch</i> mission, so it would have been nice to get a feel for the nature of the conflict: what each side stands for, why Overwatch was disbanded and reformed, etc.  This fic makes things especially confusing, since (if I&#39;m reading it correctly) it seems to be trying to redeem certain Talon characters, like Widowmaker?<br><br>I have but one line to complain about:<br><i>“Bet you enjoyed that.”<br><br>“No amount of therapy sessions can compensate for that,” he said, nodding.</i><br>The way this is written, it sounds like Zeb is saying, &quot;Therapy can&#39;t make up for how good that assassination felt,&quot; which doesn&#39;t make sense, since therapy also makes you feel good.  I think, rather than &quot;compensate for,&quot; you meant a phrase like &quot;compare with&quot; or &quot;compete with?&quot;<br><br>—doctorlit</p>

The TL;DR is that Overwatch was formed to combat the robot uprising, then collapsed after the Omnic wars and internal corruption caused public backlash.

            <p>(this is a partial slate of notes; varied reactions aren&#39;t written down)<br>- Ellie is cute, and I&#39;m liking Ave&#39;s fake-frustrated here<br>- Zeb, no, don&#39;t you&#39;ll make the console go off ... and he did<br>- Well, now I know Zeb has a thing for Genji. I&#39;m going to assume that was a bit of characterization for the guy, but I don&#39;t know what, since I don&#39;t know Overwatch<br>- Zeb with a lighting canon!<br>- &quot;special hatred for putting punctuation at the end of the last sentence of each paragraph&quot;. Took me a re-read to figure out what that was saying (but that&#39;s probably me), and I can&#39;t figure out how it connects to the setting blending together<br>- I liked the scene where Zeb was teasing Ave about Tracer and the detective<br>- The jet exploded. Both agents involved have Problems with explosions. <del>You terrible person.</del><br>- I like the line about Ave&#39;s mom<br>- The bit about Ave eyeballing the bar was a good bit of character development, I&#39;d say<br>- Oh, god, another explosion. ... &quot;Mission, not War&quot;. Poor them<br>- I want to see Ellie reacting to Zeb doing Overwatch impressions now<br>- Now you&#39;ve got me thinking about purple v. beige prose<br>- Zeb, I know you (apparently) like Soldier 76, but please get your hormones under control<br>- Petition to get Zeb a mini-Bastion! Sign here: :P<br>- “THE BATTLEFIELD IS NOT AN APPROPRIATE PLACE TO SCOUT OUT A GIRLFRIEND!” was a fun scene<br>- &quot;Wouldn&#39;t we both like to know.&quot; was a really nice line<br>- &quot;Do you think that was typed with one hand?&quot; <del>No, you know it was</del><br>- Good luck getting that plane back into HQ, y&#39;all<br>- Something about the dialogue straddling the line between the last two paragraphs felt off, probably because it took me a moment to realize that &quot;Bet you enjoyed that&quot; was Ave&#39;s line.<br><br>So, review-wise, pretty good, I think. I don&#39;t know Overwatch, so I expect half the jokes flew over my head, but the mission was interesting enough that I didn&#39;t feel the urge to put it down in the middle.<br><br>- Tomash<br></p>

            <p>I remember when you mentionned that mess of a fic back on Discord... Was there anything canon even remotely respected? I liked the interactions between Ave and Zeb, and the throwback mention to the time Ave was... taking extended vacations in the Whoniverse (before the Time War). The type of mini chosen is also just perfect.<br><br>Oh, and Ellie... Can you say &#39;Za&#39;, &#39;Wa&#39;, &#39;Ru&#39;, &#39;Do&#39;, please?<br><br>The thing with the jet at the museum reminds me of a story of Whateley Academy. The &#39;villain&#39; was robbing a museum for a scepter, and her cunning plan to escape was to use one old vehicle displayed there. She thought about it a bit more though... she had brought gas jerrycans. <br><br>It of course ended the only possible way: after an initial fakeout, the vehicle exploded, propelling her far, far away. Presence of a forcefield protected her from all harm, except the one done to her dignity, who was savagely slaughtered all along the story. Man, was that fun.</p>

I needed to start work late yesterday, so Kaitlyn and I snuck off to the cinema. ^<em>^<br><br>It&#39;s a good film - funny and charming, but serious when it needs to be. It&#39;s very much a high-school movie, except that one of the students is also a costumed superhero. ^</em>^<br><br>Tom Holland remains very fun to watch, and his interactions with Tony Stark - while fairly new to the Spidey mythos - work very well. The new characters are both well-cast and diverse (all four of the significant students-who-aren&#39;t-Spidey are non-white, and two are female), and - oh yeah - Jennifer &#39;Sarah from <i>Labyrinth</i>&#39; Connelly has a voice role. :D It&#39;s the little things, folks...<br><br>&quot;Patience.&quot;<br><br><b>Silly News</b><br><br><a href="http://lewisandquark.tumblr.com/post/162668008357/harry-potter-and-the-neural-network-fan-fiction"><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/Friday%20Forum/FF-7-7-17b.png"></a><br>(<a href="http://lewisandquark.tumblr.com/post/162668008357/harry-potter-and-the-neural-network-fan-fiction">Link</a>)<br><br><i><a href="http://lewisandquark.tumblr.com/">Lewis and Quark: Letting Neural Networks Be Weird</a></i> is my new favourite thing (Kaitlyn keeps saying I&#39;m going to leave her for the blog - not the writer, just the blog!). Over a series of gloriously surreal posts, Janelle Shane trains her neural networks on all manner of databases - from knock-knock jokes to guniea pig names. In proper neural network fashion, the network then outputs new items it thinks fit with the list... from paint colours named &quot;sudden pine&quot;, to the story title &quot;Swords and Batman: Summer Party?&quot;.<br><br>And now... she trained it on the <i>Harry Potter</i> section of AO3. And had it produce titles and summaries for its own creative works:<br><br><i><b>The Garden</b> by perverse<em>idyll for lexigilite<br>Ron and Hermione move after a man party. What did her best things go and has to deal with people she loves? How many imperfect love really belonges them and needs to be a person?

            <p>(( I was looking at the neural-net generated fanfic summaries, and this idea jumped into my head, so let&#39;s go. ))<br><br>The Perfect Cow by <del>alafaye</del> Tomash<br>Severus and Hermione start a horcruxes<br><br><hr>
<br><br>There was a knock on Severus Snape&#39;s office door.<br><br>&quot;Come in,&quot; he said, setting down the essay he was grading.<br><br>The door opened, and a bushy-haired sixth year Gryffindor stepped in somewhat hesitantly.<br><br>&quot;Ah. Miss…  Granger. What do you want?&quot; Professor Snape said coldly.<br><br>&quot;I was doing some research, Professor—&quot;<br><br><i>Of course you were.</i><br><br>&quot;—and I had a rather theoretical question. About Horcruxes.&quot;<br><br>A moment of shock crossed the Professor&#39;s face before he composed himself. &quot;And where did you hear of those, Miss Granger?&quot;<br><br>&quot;The Restricted Section, Professor.&quot;<br><br>Snape glared at her. &quot;Do not lie to me. There are no works on Horcruxes in the Restricted Section.&quot; <i>Because I personally made sure there were none once the Headmaster said he had removed them.</i><br><br>Hermione blushed slightly. &quot;Well, Dumbledore told Harry that Voldemort had made Horcruxes, and he asked me to do some research. I couldn&#39;t really find anything—&quot;<br><br>&quot;Good.&quot;<br><br>&quot;—but I do know that the idea is that, by doing something terrible, you split your soul, and then somehow put one of the pieces into an object, which makes you immortal unless the extra piece is destroyed.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yes, and?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I was wondering if you have to be human to make a Horcrux. Could a house-elf split their soul? Or a cow?&quot;<br><br>&quot;A <i>cow</i>, Miss Granger?&quot;<br><br>&quot;It was an example...&quot; Hermione trailed off.<br><br>&quot;I see,&quot; said Snape, somewhat dubious. &quot;Why did you think to ask me this?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Well, sir,&quot; Hermione said, &quot;you <i>are</i> the Defense Professor.&quot;<br><br>&quot;So I am. But such questions are more a matter for the Department of Mysteries.&quot;<br><br>Hermione nodded.<br><br>&quot;Now, do you have any other inane questions with which to waste my time? Whether ants can make wards, perhaps?&quot;<br><br>&quot;No, Professor. Thank you.&quot; Hermione quickly left the office.<br><br>Hermione made her way back to the Common Room, somewhat disappointed that she couldn&#39;t get the answer she was looking for. On the way there, however, she remembered that she did, after all, know someone from the Department of Mysteries. Well, &quot;know&quot; wasn&#39;t quite right. The man had come to talk to her last summer about keeping what she&#39;d seen in the Department quiet. He&#39;d been rather creative with the threats, and he had asked her to keep an ear out for anything the Department might be interested in.<br><br>It was a long shot, Hermione knew, but, as she settled down in front of the fire, she thought she&#39;d try anyway. She pulled out a piece of parchment and a quill and began writing:<br><br><i>Dear Mr. Brown,<br><br>I&#39;ve got a theoretical question about Horcruxes…</i><br><br>(( - Tomash ))</p>

            <p>You&#39;re back! :D<br><br>Reaction to the Fandom News:<br>That&#39;s good to hear that it&#39;s a good movie with a diverse cast! I personally really hate it when a canon work focuses so much on having a diverse/minority cast that it ruins the plot. (Which is Steven Universe, in my opinion. Even some members of the team that works on it are radfem jerks. But anyway.)<br><br>Reaction to the Silly News:<br>Those story summaries are just the best... I love it when an AI has its derpy moments.<br><br>Reaction to the Serious News:<br>That&#39;s a pretty interesting story, haha! A video game forum saved the day! Well done, gamers!<br><br>Reaction to the Not News:<br>That&#39;s actually an interesting AU-crossover-thingy! I wonder who the other folks would be? (By the way, I can&#39;t see the photos. I think Photobucket has a new policy and that&#39;s why, because the things that are in place of your photos say stuff about 3rd-party hosting and have Photobucket links in them.)<br><br>-Twistey</p>

            <p>I think that breaks a bit of my website, too. Nothing important, IIRC, but I guess I don&#39;t get to have character image galleries as part of their profiles anymore. Siiigh. This was, like, the whole point of Photobucket.

            <p>I have 300-400 images across Photobucket which I need to shift somewhere less obnoxious - but Imgur doesn&#39;t use human-readable filenames. Is there any way to set things up to automatically convert the Photobucket names to Imgur ones in my HTML documents? When I write it out like that I have to assume no - unless there&#39;s some way to compare image files on the computer to ones hosted on Imgur?<br><br>Hmm... actually, at a pinch I could upload to Imgur and then re-download (does it have a bulk download function? I can&#39;t find one. :( ). But I&#39;d still need something that could compare the images under the filenames and find the ones that matched.<br><br>And I don&#39;t know how to do that. :(<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Well, the actual name change is multiple search-replaces over a lot of files, which generally involves hammering at your website with <tt>sed</tt> or <tt>perl</tt>.<br><br>What I&#39;d do is somehow put together a list of photobucket  imgur mappings, and then just programatically apply all of them, which I don&#39;t think is too hard, but I can elaborate on that if you&#39;d like.<br><br>Now, as to the files thing, apparently imgur lets (or used to let, not sure) you download albums as a .zip. Don&#39;t know if that generalizes. There&#39;s also <a href="https://github.com/4pr0n/ripme">a program I stumbled into</a> of unknown usefulness. (Come to think of it, getting all the imgur URLs and/or the images hosted therein might be the trickiest part of the operation).<br><br>Now, for the comparison stuff, there&#39;s a good many programs that offer duplicate file detection, and, failing that, run through both sets and compute hashes (<tt>sha1sum [filenames]</tt> is your friend here) to find duplicates. This won&#39;t work if imgur doesn&#39;t faithfully preserve the things you uploaded, so let&#39;s hope they don&#39;t.<br><br>I suspect this might assume access to tools or knowledge you don&#39;t have on hand (given that the answer is roughly &quot;how I would do it&quot;), so please feel free to ask lots of questions. It also might not make too much sense, since I&#39;m trying to get in a reply before I head off to work.<br><br>- Tomash<br>- Tomash</p>

            <p>GL, Martian Manhunter, and especially Superman turned out to be very difficult to fit into Beleriand/Middle-earth. The wood connection (Alan Scott&#39;s GL ring didn&#39;t work on wood) makes me like the idea of a Beorian sneaking around, slipping absolutely silently between the trees and striking from afar with unearthly accuracy. The alternative, I guess, is to drop the &#39;green&#39; and go with &#39;ring&#39; - get Celebrimbor to make an early prototype magic ring. He could definitely have one for invisibility, and I don&#39;t think mild telekinesis is out of the question. Something like that.<br><br>J&#39;onn led me down the rather strange path of invoking a Bombadil/Goldberry-esque spirit of the landscape. While not quite a Maia, they may well be able to change their forms, which is the Manhunter&#39;s defining characteristic. By making him from a distant region of Arda - maybe even Almaren, the lost island of the Valar - it&#39;s possible to also draw on the last-of-his-kind stuff.<br><br>But Superman? I haven&#39;t a single idea. All his key characteristics are too &#39;magical&#39; - flight, heat vision, super strength. I could find someone who has a single one - for instance Hurin with his troll-slaying axework, though again the timeline doesn&#39;t work - but not a significant combination. And Beleriand doesn&#39;t really provide many candidates for the &#39;essential goodness&#39; side of Kal-El, either.<br><br>So yeah, this is part of why I abandoned it. ^_^<br><br>I am really looking forward to Thor: Ragnarok. I didn&#39;t much like the other Thor films (they were waaaaay too dark visually, it was impossible to see what was going on), but this one looks like a heap of fun. &quot;I know him!

            <p>It&#39;s long been a bugbear of mine that there are no true mad scientists in HQ. We had DoSAT, but they&#39;re engineers (though suitably mad). We had the DMSE&amp;R, but they were extremely specialised and Not Relevant To My Interests<sup>TM</sup>. We had the Medical Research Division, but they seemed to actually want to do their job sensibly. And of late we had the Division of Applied-and-theoretical Multiversal Physics, but they only had one document to their name, and I hadn&#39;t even decided which department they were a division of.<br><br>Note the past tense above.<br><br>It is with great pleasure and not a little trepidation that I introduce a brand shiny new PPC department, designed specifically to deal with all those nagging little scientific questions you never knew needed asking: the <b>Department of Analytical Science</b> (DAS).<br><br>Formed from the merger of the DMSE&amp;R and the DAMP, the Thistle and Flowering Leek have branched out into more than half a dozen fields, from chemistry and physics to geology and archaeology. With a large and eclectic collection of agents, DAS stands ready to solve all the scientific problems you care to name - or at least, to reword them in such complicated language that you don&#39;t feel bad about not understanding it.<br><br>And with even greater pleasure and trepidation, I would like to present the very first work of the new-formed department: the <b>Journal of Investigating Veracity by Experimentation</b>.<br><br><font size="6"><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/169FF6AOFyO_qkrm1VFDRIwUHKWBT4q0ljZJjZvyYi9I/pub">DAS-JIVE, Issue 1: &quot;To Think, They Called Us Mad&quot;</a></font><br><br>Comprising eleven scientific papers on diverse fields by the staff of DAS, along with a foreword by the joint department heads, and biographies of the scientists themselves. The subjects range from an attempt to construct an evolutionary tree of Mary-Sues (Agent Yasmeen, DAS-SWEAR, aka the former DMSE&amp;R), to an archaeological exploration of OFUM&#39;s universe (Agents Joan and Durand, DAS-AWAY), by way of narrativium (Alembic and Sunniva, DAS-VOID), generic surface (Mandy and Wei-ting, DAS-MAD), and cooking (Huinesoron &amp; Atlas, DAS-DIG).<br><br>Naturally, given the diversity of the agents of DAS, their papers don&#39;t even attempt to conform to the same style. I recommend sticking your head into all of them, even if you don&#39;t read to the end - you never know what you might be missing.<br><br>~<br><br>I&#39;ve put a whole heap of work into this, so it would be very nice to hear some opinions on it. But reviews aren&#39;t the only thing I want (though I definitely do; knowing people are reading your work is half of what keeps writers going, so it&#39;s always kind to comment when you read something). There are plans for a DAS-JIVE Issue 2, and for that to happen there&#39;s two things I&#39;d like from you:<br><br>1/ <b>Ideas</b>! I&#39;ve got a couple (though most of the &#39;another paper is needed/research is ongoing&#39; comments from Issue 1 won&#39;t be followed up), but there&#39;s lots of agents who need something to do. I don&#39;t promise to use them, but if you&#39;ve got a scientific question about anything in the multiverse(s), ask it and I&#39;ll see if any of the agents want it.<br><br>2/ <b>Letters</b>! I really wanted a Letters to the Editor section, but couldn&#39;t come up with anything to put into it. So if any of your agents have an interest in science (or you want to pick up any NPCs who do), go ahead and have them write in. I&#39;m sure there&#39;ll be a great many responses.<br><br>~<br><br>A note on agents: in merging the DMSE&amp;R into DAS, I&#39;ve re-adopted Agent Niamh away from Lily Winterwood. Along the way, I&#39;ve resolved the question of why she&#39;s sometimes shown as a stern blonde Irishwoman, and sometimes a cheerful Vietnamese. Answer: it&#39;s both, and she won&#39;t tell anyone why. (Okay, I know, not really &#39;resolved&#39;...)<br><br>I&#39;ve also kept Agent Penny, who has long been in the DMSE&amp;R, and who I adopted years ago. She&#39;s in DAS-SQUEE now, the biology unit.<br><br>I deliberately haven&#39;t mentioned the other named DMSE&amp;R agents. They may be working in DAS-SWEAR or DAS-SQUEE; they may have retired long ago; they may have moved to a completely different field. Not my agents, not my choice, but I&#39;m not closing the door on them.<br><br>Norlossë has been mentioned once before, <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DyqkDATndk0Jkm4wFX9bCqxdNFuTJGQg8w8V6WTCuYo/pub">here</a>; she was always intended to be a member of DAMP.<br><br>Oh, and Agent Huinesoron is doing double-duty as an agent of DOGA and DAS-DIG. He also helps out DAS-AWAY occasionally, and has a reserve position with SIELU. He&#39;s a busy bee; serves him right.<br><br>Other than that, all the DAS agents are new creations. At some point some of them will probably go free-to-use, but for now, please give them a warm welcome.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Um, yeah.  This is amazing, and I don&#39;t think I could have executed this idea given five years of writing time.  I would gush more, but I need to get this typed out in the hour before I leave for work, so let&#39;s go.<br><br><u>Editorials</u><br>Actually, backing up, I just figured out the title is the scientists saying that <i>are now</i> mad scientists, where they weren&#39;t before.  Clever!<br><br>I like that you manage to get across the personality difference between the Flowers within the bare-bones paragraphs of an editorial column.  Love the little Thistle signature you made, too, in color even!<br><br>The Leek calls itself a &quot;Leak,&quot; though.<br><br><u>Flashpatch</u><br>I like that the departmental flashpatch&#39;s watermelon gets divided into slices for the divisions.  I like the pseudo-characterization you give all the ants to fit them, too.<br><br><u>Cladogram</u><br>Haven&#39;t actually started the <i>Young Wizards</i> series yet, but I&#39;ve osmosised some stuff about it from you and Nesh talking about it on the Board.  I love the implication here that the Manual represents such a universal good that even characters from other universes can be chosen to follow it.<br><br>Yeah, I&#39;ve never really thought the family tree idea worked for Suvians, and a lot of the Latin names made over the years feel pretty half baked.<br><br>On #27 in both versions of the chart, the &quot;terrible&quot; is missing the opening quotation mark.<br><br><u>Stellar</u><br>I really like that you use one of the papers to address the idea that science can&#39;t necessarily answer everything, especially when limited by the minds and experiences of those performing it.  And also the fact that different worlds have different laws, and that the same science isn&#39;t guaranteed to work multiverse-wide.<br><br>The ending is incredibly PPC to me, in light of the above; continuing to work together in spite of differences.<br><br><u>Narrativium</u><br>This was a bit hard to follow due to chemistry being my un-subject, but I do appreciate that you haven&#39;t reduced narrativium to an ordinary solid matter.  I especially loved the puns inherent in the extractions.<br><br><u>The Rose</u><br>When I started reading this, I was excited by the incoming <i>Dark Tower</i> reference . . . but then it wasn&#39;t.  So I got confused.  Is this meant to be an Ardan native&#39;s take on TDT&#39;s rose?  Or was this a separate concept in Tolkien&#39;s writings?  Or a joke about the center of the universe being shaped like a d20?<br><br>Anyway, the formal-sounding Tolkien style in which Norlossë writes lends itself especially well to a scientific publication.<br><br><u>Cannibal</u><br>I liked that this got set up by an allusion in one of the earlier stories.  Also fun was the callback to &quot;Woodsprite of the North.&quot;<br><br>Under Sue #1, was the use of &quot;DMSE&amp;R&quot; rather than &quot;DAS&quot; intentional?<br><br><u>Cookbook</u><br>The taste metaphors of the review types are quite thoughtful and funny.<br><br>As a person who constantly complains about the food culture in my own country, I especially appreciate that the animal agent doesn&#39;t comprehend the concept of eating fancy foods for enjoyment.  <s>Because no, zoo guest, I don&#39;t need to refill that animal&#39;s empty food bowl, because the food is measured out to be a day&#39;s worth of nutrients, and animals that have food in front of them all day will overeat and get fat, because eating is for survival, not for fun, and you <i>don&#39;t</i> get to tell me how to take care of wild animals, <i>suburbanite</i>.</s><br><br><u>Archaeology</u><br>Not much to say here, other than I appreciate the choice of species for this forced split-up gag.  I was wondering why you wanted a train agent . . .<br><br><u>Ancillary Canons</u><br>I really love your interpretation of how agents of different backgrounds might look at this topic.  The note the story ends on is especially nice, allowing that the work the PPC does is bigger than defining what&#39;s &quot;real.&quot;<br><br>This one phrase seems to have an extra/missing word in it?  &quot;Containing a radically different view of Middle-earth&#39;s nature early days to that seen in the <i>Silmarillion</i> . . .&quot;<br><br><u>Generic Surface</u><br>The escalating argument communicated via scientific paper is hilarious and well executed.<br><br>I most especially like that you managed to avoid actually describing much about generic surface; after all, the whole point of the stuff is that it&#39;s hard to describe!  I suspect the scientists&#39; squabble was engineered by Legal to ensure generic surface remains generic . . .<br><br>Oh, interesting theory about the light, too.  After all, with no visible light sources, the light in HQ must come <i>from</i> the generic surface, yeah?<br><br><u>Suvian Biology</u><br>. . . This paper, in particular, must have been an hours-long time sink for you.  I can&#39;t even imagine going through all those different writings and working out all the different species.  The tables alone . . . wow.<br><br>You spelled Cocoa Puff&#39;s name as &quot;Cocao&quot; both times it appears.<br><br>I am sorry for not being as detailed as I usually am, but I&#39;m covering days for my lead keeper&#39;s vacation this week, and the only way I could get this written out was to squeeze it in between shifts.  I apologize for any mistakes I made in rushing to type this.  I also have some letters to the editor in mind, but they&#39;ll need to wait for a separate post, as I need to leave in eleven minutes, and haven&#39;t brushed teeth yet.<br><br>—doctorlit, eating breakfast for the nutrients, not because he likes to eat breakfast</p>

            <p><u>Editorials</u>: Thanks! ^<em>^ For some reason I&#39;ve found it impossible to spell Leek right, even though &#39;leak&#39; isn&#39;t exactly a word I use on a daily basis. I&#39;ve had to correct her <i>so</i> many times.  (Also I could never keep in my head that the Thistle is supposed to be male; to my mind he&#39;s clearly female, which means the Leek is clearly male... despite being female. I&#39;ve no idea, honestly.)<br><br><u>Cladogram</u>: What, you don&#39;t think <i>Middleschoolicus builtlikeapornstarricus</i> is the most excellentest Latin evar? Shame on you.<br><br><u>Stellar</u>: Yep, that&#39;s the idea. This is <i>PPC HQ</i>. Everything in it is affected by how people think (I may do a paper on different forms of mini in Issue 2). So when a mathematician and a magical White Hole get together to discuss stars... yeah, they were never going to answer anything. (I tried to keep the theme of &#39;actually getting concrete answers is super hard&#39; running through the entire journal.)<br><br><u>Narrativium</u>: I knew going in that there were going to be some papers that some people couldn&#39;t understand, and the chemistry one was always going to be high on the list. But it sounds like you enjoyed it anyway, so that&#39;s good!<br><br><u>The Rose</u>: ... is a reference to &lt;a href=&quot;<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uyY7ugbeCepIb">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uyY7ugbeCepIb</a></em>VirsCPh-OeWV8kNukM1YxxWilDLwg/edit#&quot;&gt;this paper</a> by the DAMP (before it was DAS-DAMP), which creates the theory that the multiverseplex is an icosahedron (because... just because). It said this:<br><br><i>The question of what occupies the centre of the Icosahedron, where all the multiverses meet, is likely to become highly debated. Already several hypotheses are being bandied about, including the notion that it is a ‘real’ multiverse of which all ours are but shadows (though this idea is also said of the outside of the Rose), that it is simply a mathematical point with no physical significance, and that ‘At the center of all lies the Dark Tower, do it please ya.’</i><br><br>... which may actually have been quoting you. ;) I&#39;ve dropped a link to the paper into the first paragraph, which should really have been there all along.<br><br><u>Cannibal</u>: The DMSE&amp;R is intentional. Most of Dr. Niamh&#39;s collection is inherited from the old department. (And yeeeeah, Alumia. ^<em>^)<br><br><u>Cookbook</u>: And now I&#39;ve learnt something about animals! It was actually moderately difficult to figure out how to do Atlas&#39; parts, but then the idea of the salt entry hit me. At that point it all fell together.<br><br><u>Archaeology</u>: I&#39;ll let you in on a secret - I just came up with things I wanted to use for agents, and then maneuvered them to fit. I have a document where I listed first their species, then the details, then their personalities, and usually finally their names. A <i>Thomas the Tank Engine</i> agent was a fun idea, so I found a division to slot her into.<br><br>She was also the hardest one - other than Atlas - to photograph. I&#39;ve artificially recoloured her from red to bronze, and added a hint of lips and eyelashes (because this is TTTE - it&#39;s not subtle about sexual dimorphism in steam engines).<br><br><u>Ancillary Canons</u>: This one came about because of Norlosse, actually. She&#39;s a Middle-earth native, but is also obviously not from the Middle-earth canon. I needed (well, wanted) a name for that, and I had a physicist with a sociological bent to hand...<br><br><u>Generic Surface</u>: Yay, it worked! ^</em>^ The idea of &#39;two students fall through the Avon Rift and have to work together despite not getting on&#39; was a very early one, but this ended up being the last paper written, because I didn&#39;t know how exactly to do it. I&#39;m pleased it worked. ^<em>^<br><br><u>Suvian Biology</u>: And this is where it all started. I wanted to piece together everything we had on Suvian biology, and see if there was any way to make it coherent. The idea of writing it as a formal review article popped up about halfway through the table, and led directly to &quot;what if I made <i>more</i> mad scientists...?&quot;. (As for Agent Cocoa - I have no excuse. It&#39;s just like the Leek.)<br><br>Thank you for your extremely detailled review. ^</em>^ It&#39;s hard to descibe just how much it means to know that someone&#39;s read it, and liked it, in such detail. This goes to everyone else, too: thank you.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Hey, I&#39;m happy to review!  You always put a lot of creative effort into your stuff, and it shows—to say nothing of all the development you do within the setting, in areas most of the rest of us don&#39;t even touch!<br><br>---<br><br>Hey there!  Just found a copy of your science mag, ad went browsing through.  Lot of stuff I don&#39;t get, &#39;cause, you know, big science and stuff.  But there was one thing stood out as being way weird, even to me.  In the one article, about Narrativium, why the heck did your scientists give it Zq as an abbreviation?  Shouldn&#39;t that be, like, Na or NR or something?<br><br>—Laquisha of the Nursery!<br><br>---<br><br>To Agent Narlossë of DAS-DAMP:<br><br>I recently finished your article &quot;Mapping the Rose&quot; in the premier issue of JIVE.  It&#39;s a very interesting theory, and gives me, as a former resident of a science fiction galaxy, much to think about!<br><br>However, I must admit, there appears to be one aspect of reality missing from your examination: you&#39;ve listed many of the PPC&#39;s alternate <i>universes</i>, but none of its alternate <i>timelines</i>.  We all know they exist, even if we don&#39;t like to talk of them much!  So how do they fit into your classification scheme—if it&#39;s even able to account for them!<br><br>—Technician Voctor Kamras, DoSAT<br><br>---<br><br>Regarding your article, &quot;The Trials and Triumphs of Ancillary Canons&quot; :<br><br>It was definitely an interesting read.  (I&#39;m of the &quot;World One agent who follows the Compromise Model&quot; camp, myself.)  While reading, though, it occurred to me that there is one more sort of story that you didn&#39;t cover: parodies.  Things like <i>Spaceballs</i> that are more of an homage of a genre, I can easily see being their own proper canon.  But what about more derivative parodies, like National Lampoon&#39;s <i>The Hunger Pains</i>, or <i><a href="https://cronkitezine.asu.edu/issues/2005/09/01/arts/693639">The Lord of the Discs</a></i>?  What do the two models say about them?<br><br>—Agent Doc, Department of Floaters<br><br>---<br><br>To Dr. Niamh:<br><br>Regarding the Suvian genetics section of your paper, Medical has known about that for years now.  Back when a couple of <s>gullible</s> generous agents adopted Agent Alec, a reformed Sue, when the boy got de-aged, Alec&#39;s DNA <a href="http://elementwizard.livejournal.com/56682.html">changed itself</a> to make him actually their genetic child in everything but fact.  Kind of nice, actually, having a kid without the actual <i>having</i> part.  Anyway, you might want to do more research before publishing, in future.<br><br>—anonymous, BRD<br><br>---<br><br>—doctorlit finished typing with four minutes to spare this time, still needs to brush</p>

            <p>Something is apparently wrong with time flow in HQ. I am quite sure that I cannot have known agent Hieronymus for more than six weeks. We spent most of this time in the Third and Fourth PPC HQ Hunger Games and on missions, and I remember every single day of it.

            <p>To the editors of the Journal of Investigating Veracity by Experimentation;<br><br>First off, I—what? Why are you reading over my shoulder? <br><br>Yes, I&#39;m typing this out verbatim, what of it? <br><br>I suppose that is a valid point. Very well. First off, <i>we</i> must congratulate you on the establishment of what we are sure will become a most respectable publication. The PPC has been in need of a reputable scientific journal for far too long. While admittedly lacking in some areas, DAS-JIVE will no doubt fill a needed gap and help to bolster the development of pan-fictional scientific development for years to come.<br><br>That being said, I must personally confess to some confusion. As one of the preeminent PPC experts on cross-canonical technology development and artificial intelligence, I must question why I—and my team, I suppose—was not approached regarding this publishing. I have to assume this was some sort of oversight, and not some form of subtle retribution for the incident with the DAS coffee maker. As I explained both at the time and to the Thistle and Flowering Leek later, I had no knowledge of what the interns were doing and did not approve the installation of that additional piping.<br><br>In any case, my team and I look forward to the next issue.<br><br>Yours sincerely,<br><br>Dr. Daphne St. Auguste (Sc.D., Ph.D.), DoSAT-T&amp;A<br>(Also both Tess Jachowicz and Naas&#39;Gehlen vas Headquarters, who were reading over my shoulder and offering comments during the writing of this letter. Your additions have been noted, now please go file your reports.)<br><br>((OOC: So I really enjoyed this concept of yours, and will post some more in-depth thoughts later. But reading the various reports brought these three back into my head, so I decided to do a brief silly thing first. —PC ))</p>

I was really wondering where the big mad scientist fellows had gotten to in HQ, and, ey, there they are! <br><br>I will admit to preferring the more &#39;story-ish&#39; bits over the purely &#39;report-ish&#39; bits- &#39;The Trials and Triumphs of Ancillary Canons,&#39; while certainly still an interesting and fascinating read, was somewhat dull, compared to the ones with more sort of agent hijinks, y&#39;know? Especially considering how well you do agent hijinks! But perhaps that is more of a personal thing - I would probably, by default, enjoy character hijinks over an in-universe scientific report - not that the concept of an in-universe scientific report isn&#39;t bloody good and that that sort&#39;ve stuff should be done less, or any such. Anyhow, you get a real good sense of what each division does, and what all the characters are like, from each story, and they&#39;re all just so <i>different</i>, in terms of structure and all. And, yes, bloody well yes do I want to read more of them! <br>It&#39;s just, good grief, this must&#39;ve taken a bloody long time to do! <br><br>So, how about, ah. Some sort of study into Generic Food? What&#39;s it made of? Does it taste the same across continua? If it doesn&#39;t, what are the differences and what causes them? What&#39;s it <i>made</i> of? <br><br>I imagine an attempt into studying the nature of irony in HQ would be the sort of thing they would try, too, with probable emphasis on the &#39;attempt&#39; and &#39;try&#39; bits of that. Just how far <i>can</i> you try to exploit irony in HQ? What are the limits of its reality bending capabilities? How many layers of irony on top of irony can you have before things get <i>really</i> weird? Or, er, some such. That all might be a touch vague. </p>

            <p>First, this is an awesome concept (and also ties in with a few ideas I had, but I&#39;ll get to those later), and I really enjoyed reading these. They&#39;re clever and funny. <br><br>Secondly, if Ned oybjf uvf dhnagn va n znaare fvzvyne gb n pregnva pnaba ur&#39;f pyrneyl na nyyhfvba gb (the rot13 is <i>So You Want To Be A Wizard</i> spoilers, more or less), I&#39;ll be vaguely unhappy. <del>Also, how dare you remind me of that!</del><br><br>Thirdly, re: flashpatches: with the departmental one, basically-black on black doesn&#39;t wore very well for me. I&#39;m effectively guessing if there&#39;s supposed to be an ant there or no. Similarly, more contrast on DAS-VOID and DAS-SQUEE&#39;s ants  please? They&#39;re quite hard to see, let alone distinguish.<br><br>That being said, I like the descriptions of the patches and why they were chosen for each devision.<br><br>Fourthly, &quot;You can&#39;t get much more negative than this, Professor.&quot; was a good line, though I will admit to skimming the technical bits (in the grand tradition of paper-readers everywhere)<br><br>(Intermission: &quot;like unto those we have observe<b>s</b>&quot; -&gt; &quot;observed&quot; in the conversation between Maria and Ned).<br><br>Fifthly, the whole Maria/Ned thing was fun reading. And Peregrin is currently demanding observatory access from somewhere near the back of my brain.<br><br>Sixthly, reading Anglish is painful. Writing it must have been more so. Thanks for not subjecting the wider PPC to an entire untranslated article.<br><br>Seventhly, interesting bit of multiverse theory there.<br><br>Eighthly, I&#39;m liking the interplay between the papers around the fridge getting raided and the samples being eaten. Also, more Laduquac please.<br><br>Ninthly, the bit about salt was one of the best lines in the cookbook (which was good).<br><br>Tenthly, Joan and Durand have the &quot;agent pair that rub each other the wrong way&quot; dynamic going pretty well.<br><br>Eleventhly, Mandy really needs to start talking to Building Maintenance more.<br><br>Twelthly, the review article is rather appreciated (on an in-universe basis) because there&#39;s never enough of those.<br><br>Finally, expect RC #112358&#39;s reactions to this sometime soon-ish (given that it&#39;s a bit past midnight already)<br><br>...

            <p>Peregrin checked the mail on the console somewhat carefully. Experience ­— and his former partner, Tomash, now a technician with DoSAT — had alleviated his initial fear that the console would explode or something if he did the wrong thing, However, it was still important to be cautious, since the console could explode because it felt like it, though it was nice enough to almost always stay in one piece.<br><br>The subject line &quot;New Department of Analytical Science&quot; caught his eye. He read the message, which announced the formation of a new department dedicated to, well, science, and the creation of a new journal. He then checked the sender, because this sounded like a prank. It wasn&#39;t.<br><br>&quot;Taq! Taq!&quot; he shouted. &quot;You must read this!&quot;<br><br>Taq stirred from his sleep. &quot;Sir? Whatsit? Mission, sir?&quot; he asked, still not fully awake.<br><br>&quot;The Flowers have established a new department dedicated to research and its dissemination!&quot; Peregrin explained, rather excited. &quot;This is wonderful news, and I really must see what they have recently accomplished! There might even be results that will help resolve some of the Seminar&#39;s open questions! I will also have a place to publish that is less likely to be ignored!&quot; <br><br>He then noticed that Taq looked rather uninterested in the march of scientific progress in HQ. &quot;My apologies. I was quite excited. Feel free to go back to sleep.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Well, sir, if&#39;n this is important, I should see it.&quot;<br><br>&quot;That is true.&quot; Peregrin printed off two copies of the journal, handed one to Taq, and began to read. Before long, Peregrin&#39;s copy was marked over with notes and computations in the margins, while Taq tried to look like he had some idea of was going on in the papers, even though he didn&#39;t.<br><br>Eventually, Peregrin finished his reading, put the journal down, and started wandering the halls with thoughts about the geometry of HQ bouncing around his head. (Taq had gone back to sleep in the meantime)<br><br>After some vaguely-defined amount of time had passed off-screen, the following letter appeared wherever a letter to DAS-DAMP would be delivered to, accompanied by a large stack of photocopied notes that had been hastily binder-clipped together:<br><br>To my colleagues at the D.AS (D.AMP),<br><br>I have read your theory about the structure of the multiverse and found it rather intriguing, though I am not convinced that it provide much of an explanation for the cross-universe bleed-through that occurs when fanfiction is written about some universe.<br><br>In the interests of greater scientific collaboration, please find attached my observations and theories regarding the topology of Headquarters, as well as my notes from all meetings of the Inter-Metaversal Seminar on Universal Topology that occurred in my subjective past.

            <p>Well, I suppose the ants would be mostly invisible in practice, because trying to make them out when the patch is on someone&#39;s uniform must be tricky.

            <p>They&#39;re in PPC HQ, and that doesn&#39;t show up on search engines very often.<br><br>... okay, so Galileo Galilei had a daughter who went into a convent as Suor Maria Celeste. (Actually, he had two, but she&#39;s the one with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo%27s_Daughter">a book about her</a>.) That particular convent was San Matteo, outside Florence. She died of dysentry in 1634.<br><br>Meanwhile, in <a href="http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/The_Galileo_Trap_(audio_story)">a Doctor Who audiobook</a>, alien bounty hunters visited Florence. In what&#39;s either a fic based on the audiobook, or just a visit to the pseudo-canonical story itself, PPC agents rescued S. Maria Celeste from the convent&#39;s ruins after said aliens destroyed it. Along with the two other remaining nuns, she was brought to HQ, and treated for that nasty case of dysentry she had going on.<br><br>While getting established in the PPC, the nuns came across the notion that Galileo would someday (and in some canon) be canonised as a saint. S. Maria Celeste gleefully dedicated their new convent in HQ to him, and set about making it a home for science.<br><br>The three of them have drifted a long way from the baseline practices of the Poor Clares, but they do maintain the rules about staying in the convent and not letting other people in. Exceptions for astronomical entities and ambulatory flowers have been worked out over time. ;)<br><br>(The outlines of this are clear from her bio and paper, so I don&#39;t feel bad about sharing it.)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I never really thought about something like that inside the PPC before. But now I read it? I can&#39;t believe The PPC went for so long without something like that. In my book, it makes it a very good idea.<br><br>Now, quick question. Will DAS also look over problems and questions concerning magic, whatever it&#39;s a form of magic tied to tecnhology or not?

            <p>Depends on the question. ;) If it falls into one of the existing divisions (eg, DAS-DIG could deal with earth magic), definitely. If it would need a new division, then... possibly. Like I say, it depends on the question.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I think you&#39;ve put the cart before the horse, trying to start a Suvian family tree with Sues themselves. I would never go so far as to suggest that our respected members of the scientific community have simply been &quot;classifying&quot; Sues as an exercise in coming up with silly Latin names, of course, but as we all know, most Sues are pretty much like most other Sues, making separating them into &quot;species&quot; a daunting task at best. Thus, attempting to begin with their minor differences to each other is backward and ultimately fruitless.<br><br>Let us consider first the wider ecosystem of fiction.<br><br>Your biology departments may wish to collaborate with DAS-DAMP and DAS-VOID to explore the inherent issues involved in fitting Sues into a broader understanding of the multiverse, but for now, let&#39;s just take it for granted that classifying fictional entities is not like classifying biological entities. It is not particularly useful to look at how they interbreed, for instance, and anatomy and physiology aren&#39;t much help, either. Not even DNA can come to the rescue here.<br><br>Fictional characters, you see, are not classified by what they <i>are</i>, but rather by what they <i>do</i>, and more importantly, <i>how</i> they do it. Protagonist: hero: warrior. This character bravely faces challenges head-on to prove that good will always triumph over evil. Antagonist: villain: evil sorcerer. This character sneakily connives for their own ends regardless of collateral damage to others, pulling strings and manipulating events behind the scenes. Etc. I trust you see where I&#39;m going with this, with reference to well-known character archetypes.<br><br>One must consider the character&#39;s prominence in the story: are they a main character? a supporting character? a background character? What separates these from each other? I would suggest that it has something to do with inherent narativium.<br><br>Now, once we understand the basics of classifying fictional characters in general, we can turn to the finer details of classifying <i>fan</i>fictional characters.<br><br>One important question I do not believe has yet been addressed is the ability of Suvians to become non-Suvian with time, and vice versa. If they are a separate species from other OCs, how is this possible? I assert that it isn&#39;t. All characters, canons, OCs, and Suvians, fit into the classification scheme I&#39;ve referenced above; the difference between them lies in how destructive they are to the surrounding ecosystem of the canon. Suvians have often been compared to parasites, viruses, and other destructive organisms. That&#39;s getting close to the truth: Suvians are, in fact, <i>diseased forms</i> of the character archetypes we all know and love. A Suvian is a character infected and mutated by glitter. This is well substantiated by numerous anecdotes of regular characters becoming Sued after coming into contact with glitter, and Suvians becoming de-Sued when their glitter load is reduced. It is also well-known that a good character can possess all the same surface traits as a Suvian, and yet not be one. This is entirely due to glitter.<br><br>Therefore, in order to properly classify Suvians, we must look at them not as a species in their own right, but as normal character archetypes afflicted by particular forms of disease that warp and corrupt their nature. Only then can a useful classification system be achieved.<br><br>~Agent Neshomeh, Archivist, DoP<br><br>(( Good lord, that&#39;s a lot of words. I hope some of them make sense. I don&#39;t have a lot of time to refine this idea right now, unfortunately. ^_^; ))</p>

            <p>I&#39;m not sure <i>Dr. Niamh</i> will like it, but that&#39;s for her response in the Letters section.<br><br>I think this theory would make glitter more or less a different form of author-wraith: like slash-wraiths, infusing a character with it alters its nature. It makes just as much sense as any other theory. ;) If we want to draw in the glitter-golems hypothesis, then natural Suvians (rare) are of that kind, while the various created kinds are archetypes with glitter shoved into them.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>So, the difference between wraiths and Suvians, IMO, is that wraiths always target canon characters whereas Suvians are original characters. With this theory, though, I wonder if that distinction becomes moot, and normal OCs can be infected with the same range of issues that go along with wraiths. But I don&#39;t think you can exorcise glitter, though, so maybe not. Maybe glitter is like a bacteria or virus, and wraiths are more like parasites.<br><br>That would make Archir the Emerald make a bit more sense, I guess: he was a parasite evolved not to need to inhabit a host, instead feeding indirectly through close contact.<br><br>Honestly, he should just have been a character replacement, though. &gt;.&gt; (And how do we fit <i>that</i> in?)<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>It looks like you&#39;re expecting to have 12 options for each question, which sounds excessive. ;) Possibly a better way would be to plot all the celebrants on a 3-D graph (ie, give them &#39;scores&#39; on three independent scales). You then assign values for some or all of the scales to each answer, and find the celebrant closest to the final averaged result.<br><br>Example: one axis would be how likely they are to be swayed by the Lone One&#39;s temptations. You&#39;d place the Untouched at 0, the Undecided at, say, 5, and the Betrayed at 10. The Lone One Itself would be down at 15. Not sure about the Master Shark, you&#39;d have to think about how he feels about death.<br><br>Then, for each question, you&#39;d say how it affects that score. Taking what I think is the most interesting of your questions so far:<br><br><b>How do you relate &#39;friends&#39; and &#39;fighting&#39;?</b><br>-I fight <u>for</u> my friends. (2)<br>-I fight <u>with</u> my friends. (10)<br>-I fight <u>about</u> my friends. (5)<br>-I fight <u>to control</u> my friends. (12)<br><br>Other scales might include power, friendliness, how active a role they take... assuming those four, a statement like &#39;I fight to control my friends&#39; might come out as (12 susceptability, -- power [ie, no value listed, ignore], 0 friendliness, 7 active).<br><br>You&#39;d then average out the four scales after all the questions are answered, and see which celebrant comes closest to matching. How you did that would depend on what you were running it on, though...<br><br>On a related note: I shared this with the Board a year or two back, but I&#39;m not sure you were around: I made Kaitlyn a Song of the Twelve scroll.<br><br><a href="http://s66.photobucket.com/user/TangledWebs/media/458810ab-6998-44d5-957b-a1f770d44fc7.jpg.html">Image</a><br><br>It includes all the text from the book (along with a header and footer you&#39;ll probably recognise ^_~). I was quite pleased with how it turned out.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I am <i>very</i> sorry for how long this took me.  This has not been a productive week . . .<br><br>The opening banter is excellent, showing that Ix clearly thinks about her looks, but is also embarrassed to come off as Sue-like.  It also shows the bit of strain this puts on their relationship, where it&#39;s difficult for Charlotte to complement Ix without making her feel self conscious.  And you get it all across in so few lines . . . wish we could all dialogue like Iximaz!<br><br>I think the entrance into the fic is the best part of this story.  The simultaneous drop into italics while Ix starts reacting to the moon out of nowhere are extremely disorienting, letting the reader share in the agents&#39; feelings at that moment.  Your descriptions of the fic using Charlotte&#39;s super senses right after correcting the italics is incredibly well-detailed as well.<br><br>I love that you mock the cartoonish hand-flailing presented as the Sue getting bullied by comparing the realistic racist teasing Ix had to live through—and really, the whole mission is some great side-by-side of a werewolf Sue and your realistic werewolf character, which hardly needs to be pointed out, since that was clearly your intent.  And you summarize that whole theme just utterly perfectly in Ix&#39;s speech just before the assassination.<br><br>To give the author some credit, I <i>am</i> the type to wake up, shave, get dressed, eat, wash dishes, and then go back to bed until I absolutely need to get up and drive to work.  So.  That&#39;s something I have in common with a Sue.<br><br>I love the ending here.  I love that you write Charlotte being so dedicated and supportive of Ix, in spite of the difficulties Ix&#39;s self esteem must give her.  And I have to admit, when I hit that final line, my mind began singing ♪Tale as old as time . . .♪of its own volition.  &gt;.&gt;<br><br>Oh, and before I forget: may I adopt Fortesque, if no one else has gotten him yet?<br><br>—doctorlit transforms into a competent adult every full moon, settles back into a nearly functioning man-child the rest of the month</p>

            <p>&quot;Oh, an&#39; how&#39;s our newes&#39; friend settlin&#39; in, eh?&quot;  Hagrid peeked into the corner where Fortesque had settled in to the great, room-spanning web.<br><br>The mini-acromantula, recently delivered by a PPC agent team who had saved him from a mission, had strung an ice cream cone into the web.  Its fangs were inserted deep into the dark red ice cream—probably strawberry?<br><br>Hagrid blinked.  &quot;I still dunno where you misspellin&#39;s o&#39; Florean always seem to come up with ice cream.  Ah, well.  Just don&#39; go spoilin&#39; yer appetite!  New shipment o&#39; rats jus&#39; came in.&quot;<br><br>As Hagrid stomped back out of the room and into the canonical parts of Hogwarts Fanfiction Academy, Fortesque settled back into his treat.  Lulled by the gentle hissing of all his web-mates, he let his mind wander.  Inevitably, it kept coming back to the scarred agent who had shrieked at him not long after he had &quot;hatched.&quot;  Why  would an agent be scared?  The PPC were friends of canon.  Only Sues should be afraid of—<br><br>&quot;So, what is this place?&quot;  The deep human voice spoke out suddenly from somewhere in the room, making all the mini-acromantulas rustle in the huge web.  Fortesque looked back and forth around the room.  (Without moving his head, of course—he had eight eyes.)  No one was visible; the floor of the room was empty, save for some dusty barrels in the corners, draped in old web strands.<br><br>&quot;Who&#39;sssss there?&quot; called out Godirc.<br><br>&quot;Not to worry, folks.  I&#39;m no enemy of yours.  I must ask again, though: what is this place?&quot;<br><br>Multiple minis chimed in.<br><br>&quot;Hogwarts Fanfiction Academy!&quot;<br><br>&quot;The canons teaches the fanthingssss . . .&quot;<br><br>&quot;. . . And we protects the canons from the fanthingssss!&quot;<br><br>The unseen stranger didn&#39;t respond right away.  &quot;So you protect canon . . . by hiding out in this sub-reality, and acting as bodyguards to cheap knock-offs of the real thing?  Interesting strategy.&quot;<br><br>The room filled with angry hissing.<br><br>&quot;It is tradition!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Tradition, Precioussss!&quot;<br><br>&quot;We serves the canon!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Well, protecting the staff allows them more time to focus on teaching the students properly.  This, in turn, leads to a higher turnout of goodfic writers at the end of each year, fighting against the imbalance of fics that are canon-damaging versus canon-supportive.  It&#39;s a slow process, but we&#39;re making steady progress.&quot;<br><br>The other minis all stared at the spider who had spoken.<br><br>&quot;. . . Precious?&quot; he added, hesitantly.<br><br>The human voice spoke again.  &quot;Be that as it may, surely at least one among you would consider taking on a more . . . active role in the Canon Protection Initiative?  You there—new boy.&quot;  Climbing up onto the barrels directly underneath Fortesque, behind which he had apparently been hiding, was a tiny dark-skinned human with a black suit and an eye-patch.  Staring directly up at Fortesque, the human-shaped mini asked, &quot;Are you content to defend this canon from your corner, or do you want to defend all of canon—head on?&quot;<br><br>Fortesque stared.  He thought of the screaming agent.  Perhaps, if minis were more visible in their efforts to combat the uncanon, agents would see that minis were allies, and not be scared?  He lowered himself on a strand of silk until he was face-to-face with the strange mini, who didn&#39;t flinch.  &quot;Yessss, Precioussss . . .&quot;<br><br><b></b>The Avengers Minitiative

            <p>Having mini Agents (or mini something-like-Agents) sounds like it&#39;ll be fun reading. I also like the movie trailer feel, and I could practically hear the dramatic music at the end when I read this the first time.

But I think it&#39;s totally going to be an awesome ride on the way there!<br><br>Incidentally, I totally wanted to hide a link in the punctuation to that last sentence of the story that would link to some dramatic-sounding song out of Marvel.  It was getting close to leave-for-work-time, and I was starting to panic as I typed, so it slipped my mind.

            <p>Or follow less things at the same time? Nah, heresy.<br><br>Not really seeing that much angst here, neither unjustified one. The glitterbag is pretty much aping Ix&#39;s life, with no drawbacks and maximal speshulness, she&#39;s got more than a right to be angry andd go personal here (and I agree, throat injuries? Should be dead).<br><br>Seeing an agent facing a glitterbag mirroring their backstory is an interesting thing too. Might have to search something like that for Marina... That was a good mission in my book.</p>

            <p>Yes, there were angsty bits, but they made me feel suitably bad for Ix (and helped convey why she was so angry at the Sue), which means they worked and were well-done. The heartwarming bits also balanced out the angst.<br><br>I particularly liked the charging scene (which was a nice charge of pace from straight &quot;grab &#39;em, read the list, kill&quot;) and the &quot;lets actually talk about our problems&quot; bit.<br><br>- Tomash</p>

            <p>&#39;cause on the one hand, it&#39;s hilarious to reference <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixie_Lott">the singer</a> and use the ship name Ixielott. But on the geekier hand, I can&#39;t help but feel there&#39;s a lot of mileage in riffing off <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axolotl">axolotls</a>. Ixilotl? Only that works better spoken than written. It&#39;s a terrible dilemma.<br><br>Oh, yeah, there was a story there, too, right? ;) Two things I particularly liked were a) that I could jump in and figure out what was going on in the agents&#39; lives without having to track down every previous mission, and b) the idea of an agent running into a Suvian who claims exactly the same problems as them, so allowing for a direct contrast of the two. Nicely done.<br><br>hS </p>

            <p>Starting off the post with that subject line made me think I&#39;d done something awful with the mission! Ugh. :P<br><br>And yeah, this is honestly a big enough problem it ended up getting it&#39;s own CAHQ card... somehow. Personally, I&#39;ve been using Charlix, but Ixilotl has been growing on me for some time... <br><br>Yeah, as soon as I came across this one on the Circle, I pretty much had to drop everything to mission it.
