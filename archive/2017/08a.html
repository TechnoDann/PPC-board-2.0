It has an excellent unique unit in the Marizu Hunter and the upgraded Baronial Hunter, which, though expensive, do considerable damage and do so very quickly. The fact that they do Melee damage rather than Pierce makes them an extremely dangerous proposition, and the fact that they have access to a full Cavalry Archer upgrade tree makes them even more potent. Add to that the Baronial Hunter&#39;s bonus armour and enemies will learn to fear your rushes. However, their focus on cavalry archers makes them less flexible elsewhere, and their economic bonuses can&#39;t quite outweigh their relative predictability. However, remember that Dual Heraldries affects all Cavalry units and they have a full Cavalry upgrade tree, so Plortish Paladins are exceptionally tough. Similarly, they can pump out fairly potent foot archers as well thanks to their Villager garrison bonus, though the lack of Squires hurts them considerably. On the water... let&#39;s not talk about what happens on the water. They&#39;re just outclassed by any naval-centric civ, and the lack of both Shipwright and Dry Dock makes them distinctly underpowered on the high seas. Their siege isn&#39;t terrible, but their monks are pretty ropey, and they lose the last two techs for Stone and Gold mining, which is particularly lacklustre when their unique unit is so gold-heavy.<br><br>In team games, Plort benefits strongly from allies that affect their unique units. The Berbers are an excellent partner, with the Kasbah allowing you to pump out Marizu and Baronial Hunters at a greatly accelerated rate, especially combined with the bonus to Conscription, and the Genitour line gives Plort an incredible trash unit that really plays to their strengths. The Malians have a crazy synergy with Plort&#39;s tech boosts, with Plortish Universities pumping out research at a frankly unbelievable rate, while the Mongols give extra LOS to Light Cavalry and Hussars, allowing for Plort&#39;s lategame Hussars to really work through the map.<br><br>From the other direction, anyone who favours spam tactics (looking at you, Goths) just loves having Plort on their side. The Byzantines love them, as their super-cheap Halberdier spam compliments Plort&#39;s cavalry-heavy focus very well. The Franks and Huns are also big fans, as they can get their cavalry out much faster. Finally, Portugal and the Turks appreciate getting their units out faster, as their reduced Gold cost is pretty valuable for that sort of thing.<br><br>===<br><br>So, that&#39;s what I have so far. I&#39;ve tried to make it as comprehensive as I can. What are people&#39;s thoughts? =]</p>

While it might not do the most damage, remember that it has a boatload of defensive prowess and gains the bonus from the Scholars&#39;, and therefore everyone else&#39;s, unique technologies. The Empire&#39;s a real team player, befitting its lineage as a centre of learning and receiver of tribute from far-off lands; its units, while advanced technologically, suffer for it. Their Stables is particularly woeful, lacking both Scale and Plate Barded Armour as well as Hussars, Camels, and Paladins, so if you fancy yourself a fast knight rush, pick someone else. Anyone else. Their real strength lies in early Feudal Age M@A harassment and fending off Dark Age wolf rushes. They&#39;re exceptional hunters, too, so luring Boar and ambushing Deer is very easy for them to do efficiently. Their University is completely full, giving them good defences, and they have Ring Archer Armour and Plate Mail Armour for their foot units. However, they lack the Arbalest and, crucially, the Cavalry Archer line at all. This is not a civ for horse lovers. Navally speaking, they&#39;re pretty decent, with an almost complete tech tree that skips only Fast Demolition Rafts and Fast Fire Ships. Their Monks are pretty good, lacking only Heresy and Illumination. Finally, they lack Stone Shaft Mining, giving them a pretty excellent economy tree overall.<br><br>Everyone - and I do mean everyone - loves being on a team with the Scholars&#39; Empire. In one on one matchups, they can rely on the strength of their Elite Van Guard, but in 2v2 or more, the Van Guard line gets a huge boost. The Mongols give units +4 line of sight. The Indians give +10 damage against buildings. The Malians let everyone research University techs 160% faster. The Persians give +4 damage against archers. The Goths give a 40% bonus to Barracks output speed. And so on. It. Is. Insane.<br><br>Being such a team player does have its benefits for the Scholars as well. Their love-in with the Malians continues as both the Gbeto and the Van Guard get +5(!!) attack from Farimba, while the Magyars become very strong indeed when they remove the gold cost from <i>all</i> allied Unique Units. The Turks also appreciate the boosts to Janissaries now that both their unique technologies (+1 Range and +20 HP) apply to them. Finally, a team with Vikings, Aztecs, and Berbers gives fantastic unique units, as Genitours, Berserkers, Jaguar Warriors and Van Guards gain seriously potent regeneration and bonus damage across the board.<br><br>===<br><br>So yeah, thoughts? =]</p>

            <p>It&#39;s been a very long time since I&#39;ve played AoEII, so I don&#39;t remember the details, but even if I&#39;d never played it, I&#39;d know you&#39;d missed a perfect opportunity:<br><br>The Bronee. How close is it possible to get to a pure-cavalry nation of nomads with a tendency to fanaticism? &#39;Nomadic&#39; might be the most difficult part... faster-moving resource gatherers? I&#39;unno.<br><br>Also: the Marizu. Is conversion a thing in AoE? If so, I&#39;m imagining a ridiculously specialised nation with near-free, near-instant conversion that has little choice but to build its armies by stealing the enemy&#39;s.<br><br>~<br><br>All right, I&#39;ve gone this far, I&#39;ll take a look at what you wrote, too. ;)<br><br><b>Plort</b>: I can sort of see the rapid-research angle, and I love the melee-damaging archer (it&#39;s the sort of unconventional thing we&#39;d do), but I don&#39;t know why you&#39;ve gone for cavalry? Excepting the herd at Kwenaya, we&#39;ve never had a particular focus on horses. Rather, drawing on the PPC ethos, I&#39;d imagine Plort being about stealth, rather than speed.<br><br>Equally, I&#39;m confused by the lack of a navy. We&#39;re... it&#39;s an island civilisation. It <i>lives</i> by sending fleets to harry the Marizu coast. What led you to the idea of a naval-poor nation?<br><br><b>The S.E.</b>: The standout feature of the Scholars is their amazing teamwork. But... while, as you say, everyone wants them on their team... does anyone actually want to <i>be</i> them? Their team bonus, in particular, seems like a slap in the face for the Scholar player: &#39;thanks for boosting /my/ army... I guess when we get to the Imperial Age you can have my unique tech for your mediocre Guards&#39;. Which is decent, provided a) you&#39;ve got the right allies, and b) you only want to use that single unit.<br><br>hS </p>

            <p>Remember that each civilization gets two unique techs (one of which comes in the Castle Age as of the HD remasters), and whatever they are they affect the Van Guard. So, for instance, the Van Guard are affected by the Malian&#39;s +5 attack bonus to cavalry from Farimba, the Aztec&#39;s +4 bonus to infantry from Garland Wars, the +20 HP from the Turks&#39; Sipahi, the enormous boost to production speed from the Ethiopians&#39; Royal Heirs, the stacked-up area-of-effect damage from the Byzantines, Slavs, and Celts... the list goes on. They have a pretty excellent tech tree and do scarily well in the lategame, using their very fast Van Guard (recall that their movement speed gets boosted by 33% and for heavy infantry it&#39;s already <i>really</i> fast) to spearhead attacks while backing them up with a lot of upgrades. In any event, my point with making the Scholars&#39; Empire was to make a civ that was far stronger as an ally than on its own, because when there&#39;s nobody left but them, they crumble and fall.<br><br>On the Bronee: that&#39;s the Huns. That&#39;s basically the Huns. Probably with a similar cavalry-related unique tech to Perfusion from the Goths, but still: it&#39;s basically the Huns. Maybe with some bonuses cribbed from the Lakota in AoE3.<br><br>On Plort: I designed them around being a cavalry archer Civ because, well, cavalry archer Civs are hella fun to play and there aren&#39;t any that do melee damage. Additionally, it&#39;s very hard to do actual <i>stealth</i> in AoE, so I built it around having an excellent Castle Age to provide mid-game pressure through raiding - and you can&#39;t deny that raiding is something that we do a lot in Plort. Plortish units are very easy to mass up, particularly with the increased production speed from their team bonus, which gives them an excellent knight rush and Marizu Hunter rush.<br><br>On the Marizu: Yes, there&#39;s conversion, but having it be near-instantaneous would be monstrously overpowered. Monks and monk-style units are already very strong (the Aztecs, for instance, have a notorious monk rush) because they can convert, with the requisite upgrades, all units and even <i>buildings</i>. I mean, a conversion speed upgrade isn&#39;t out of the question, and a civ bonus that let Villagers be affected by Monastery upgrades would also work, but I&#39;m always slightly wary of boosting monks any more. I was working on a design involving concentrating your force into what essentially was a massively expensive unit that had literally every single unit armour class in the game, was affected by all upgrades, had great base stats, and trained quickly. They&#39;d be difficult to fight one on one, a nightmare en masse, and take massive bonus damage from, for instance, pikemen and halberdiers - a common trash unit that the Marizu would not even slightly care about because they don&#39;t cost gold, they must be useless, how can some smelly guy with a stick possibly hurt <i>me</i>?<br><br>But yeah, thanks for your thoughts! It&#39;s given me quite a bit to think about. =]</p>

            <p>Well, let&#39;s have a look!<br><br><i>Do I know you?</i> Yup! I&#39;ve seen you on the Board for a while, and I also remember you being active in the Discord chat. You&#39;re definitely an active member of the community.<br><br><i>The characters:</i> I have a few questions, but they&#39;re mainly small. They are:<br><br>-This bit in Crim&#39;s profile: &quot;He tends to act like he thinks he is better than everyone else, though he doesn’t actually believe as much and is only doing it for humor’s sake.&quot; It&#39;s a bit of a weird thing to do, though then again, people can be weird. You&#39;ve got to wonder how he started doing it and *why*. Or does this only actually show up in lines like his &quot;Don&#39;t call me boss, young lady&quot; line in the second prompt? If so, this suddenly makes a lot more sense to me.<br><br>-Crim&#39;s relationship to video games. From Google, I understand that he&#39;s from a video game continuum, which I assume is why he got placed in the Video Games division. How long has he been an agent? Has he been taking on missions in any canon other than his own prior to being partnered with Cynthia?<br><br>-This bit: &quot;[Cynthia&#39;s] black hair is usually tied back in a ponytail, which she claims is a purely functional choice. Nobody believes her.&quot; I&#39;m not entirely sure I&#39;m catching the meaning of this properly--is it that people believe she&#39;s doing it for beauty purposes? Something else that I&#39;m missing? Wouldn&#39;t mind some clarification here.<br><br>-I&#39;d kind of love to see Crim bore a Sue to death sometime, mainly because it sounds like it could be fun to read. That&#39;s just a comment, though, not a critique.<br><br>Overall: the characters look good! My quibbles with them are pretty minor; the biggest one is probably how on earth Crim got to the point of acting stuck-up for humor&#39;s sake. They generally look interesting and even relatable. I&#39;d say they&#39;re good (though I would like those explanations!) But can you write well with them?<br><br><i>The prompts:</i> It seems you can! I enjoyed both prompts. Your characters feel pretty fleshed out, and don&#39;t heavily contradict their profile descriptions. They also work well as a team--they bounce off each other very well, and I could imagine them working well together and creating interesting mission reports. I liked Crim&#39;s moment of awkward compassion after hearing how Cynthia lost her last partner, and I generally just like their dynamic. I also didn&#39;t spot any writing errors: if they&#39;re there, they&#39;re so small I couldn&#39;t spot them even after several read-throughs. I do have a small quibble with Crim&#39;s opinion on Loki--it&#39;s perfectly possible to know and like both Norse mythology and Marvel&#39;s weird take on Asgard--but that&#39;s a matter of my personal opinion clashing with the character&#39;s (and maybe yours?) and not an actual issue.<br><br>Overall: I liked both of your prompts. Your writing style is fun to read. Your characters have a good dynamic, and I want to read more about them despite the fact that I&#39;m unlikely to recognize any canon they go into.<br><br><i>The badfic:</i> ...okay. These are not canons I know in the slightest, despite recognizing the Pegasus Knight title (I know someone with a character who is one. That&#39;s pretty much the sum of my knowledge). I skimmed the first and last chapters anyway, trying to get a sense of it; the most I can tell is that the protagonist does have a bit of More Competent and Awesome Than You syndrome going on. Past that, I&#39;ll trust your summary, since you actually know the canons. If you think you can get a good mission out of it, go ahead. I do notice that it&#39;s characters from Crim&#39;s home canon being upstaged, so I could see this working well.<br><br>And I believe all that leaves us with is that...this all looks good! <b>Permission granted!</b><br><br>Congratulations! Go forth and write :)<br><br>~Z</p>

            <p>Regarding the &quot;Crim acting comically full of himself&quot; thing: he mostly does it because he finds it amusing. He doesn&#39;t really have any deep reason for doing it, nor does it somehow tie into his backstory (well, not in any clear way, though it presumably came from somewhere), it just strikes him as funny.<br><br>As to Crim and video games, yes, he mostly takes on Fire Emblem fics. This was especially true before being partnered with Cynthia, since she&#39;s familiar with enough video game continua to fill him in on why a fic is bad, aside from the obvious stuff.<br><br>The &quot;Cynthia&#39;s ponytail&quot; bit... actually, I can&#39;t say I entirely recall why I included that, aside from the fact that I clearly must&#39;ve found it amusing at the time. Erm.<br><br>Anyhow, I&#39;m pretty excited to be able to mission stuff. Without an angry mob forming and making me take down my unofficial missions by threat of maiming and/or death, anyhow.

            <p>Since Plort dropped off the Board, it’s time to wrap this up.<br><hr>
<br>This Council was held from the twelfth of July until the twenty-fifth of July in the City of Borrd.<br><br><b>Attendees:</b> <ul>
<li>Baron Huinesoron<br>
</li>
<li>Sar Iximaz (a baron of Plort) appeared briefly by magic<br>
</li>
<li>Baron Kaitlyn was present, but did not say a word.<br>
</li>
<li>Baron Neshomeh was still absent on a campaign against the Subjugator, but voiced her opinions through a messenger.<br>
</li>
<li>Baron PC<br>
</li>
<li>Protector Tomash of the Refuge of Ozerbord</li>
</ul>Baron Eshakhar could not attend the council – apparently traveling in countries far abroad – but she sent a message accepting her barony.<br>Baron Phobos sent a messenger to announce that he had &quot;more important matters to attend to&quot; – but since there is certainly nothing more important than the Council of Plort, he may actually have been wounded and too proud to admit that he could not travel.<br><br>Non-deciding attendees:<ul>
<li>Knight Ælcalen, mayor of L&#39;Urque<br>
</li>
<li>The Djenni, messenger of Baron Neshomeh<br>
</li>
<li>Filius Caeli, a civilian from the City of Borrd in the Protectorate of Borrd<br>
</li>
<li>Frackles, messenger of Kwenaya, messaging nothing that needed to be discussed<br>
</li>
<li>Sir Hardric, a wandering knight<br>
</li>
<li>Sir Hieronymus the hermit, keeper of the records<br>
</li>
<li>Oopart, messenger of Baron Phobos had no instructions to bring up subjects or to vote in Baron Phobos name<br>
</li>
<li>Ye Scape-Grace, a knight from Keep De&#39;endee and friend of the Diskord </li>
</ul>
<br><b>Agenda:</b><br>A change of the rules of procedure (moved to top) – a proposal by Baron Huinesoron to let the archivists of the Commonwealth of Wechi, the Beytahs of the Riding of Sittorese, Protector Tomash of Ozerbord and the Mords of the Diskord participate in the Baronial Council as <i>voting</i> representatives of their respective nations.<br><br>A new nation – the Council is asked to acknowledge the establishment of a fifth nation, referred to as the Confederation of Diskord, which took possession of lands in the far east around La Wunj and in the west on the Geymez Plateau. <br><br>A new barony – per an invocation of the Edict of Bast, the newly created Baron Eshakhar receives the lands previously held by the permanently absent Baron Cassie, including the part that has last year been ceded to the now permanently absent Baron Thanasius Ampelius. <br><br>The relocation of Barony Huinesoron – a proposal by Baron Huinesoron to let him take the lands previously held by the permanently absent barons Araeph and July, but cede the territories south of the River Meibot – he may actually have meant the Meibot’s tributary Jid&#39;ryv – back to Baron Neshomeh (west of the Auriantym Chain) respective Baron Juliette (east of the Auriantym Chain), making Neshomeh the only baron in Wechi again.<br><br>The disposition of Baron Huinesoron’s western territories – since Baron Huinesoron moves to eastern Borrd and the Riding of Sittorese, he intends to leave what is left of Ozerbord without a baron, but to cede his lands between the River Wep and the Wattuf Mountains, and the Geymez Plateau to Lady Iximaz, who, by another invocation of the Edict of Bast, would also receive the western part of former Barony Thanasius Ampelius. <br><br>The status of the City of Borrd – a move by Baron Huinesoron to exclude the capital from his new barony and let the Council of Borrd jointly take baronial authority over this city, as has been proposed on many previous occasions.<br><br>The Warden of Spelin – a move by Baron Huinesoron to appoint Ye Scape-Grace of De&#39;endee as the warden of the Temple of Spelin. <br><br>New flags – Ye Scape-Grace used the opportunity to present the flag of the Confederation of Diskord (<a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=310063;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">final version</a>) to a greater public. <br>In the absence of any actual residents of the Riding of Sittorese, Hieronymus the hermit presented the <a href="http://plort.wikia.com/wiki/Riding_of_Sittorese">flag of the Riding</a> that, due to its difficult octarine colored part, had been in the works for two years.<br> Based on the national flags, Baron Huinesoron proposed a revised <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=310125;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">Union flag</a> representing the Five Nations, the Five Eras of Rule and the Five Ages of Plort.<br><br><b>Decisions:</b><br>By votes of four to zero, Protector Tomash of Ozerbord and the Mords of the Diskord were invited to join the barons in the newly named <a href="http://plort.wikia.com/wiki/Council_of_Plort">Council of the Union of Plort</a>. <br><br>Since there is a tie between two pro-votes and two contra-votes, no decision could be made concerning the representation of the Riding of Sittorese by its Beytahs.<br><br>Although three barons support the idea of having some sort of representation of the Commonwealth of Wechi that would be independent of the resident baron, and only one baron spoke against it, the barons’ actual intentions were left unclear. By not objecting to Sir Hieronymus speaking for all denizens of Wechi, Baron Neshomeh – who obviously is a denizen of Wechi – may have changed her mind from &quot;invite the archivists&quot; (apparently intending to give one vote to each archivist) to &quot;let all denizens of Wechi have one collective vote&quot;. Either way, she would not be in agreement with Baron Huinesoron, who specified that &quot;the archivists&quot; should get one collective vote. Sar Iximaz’s &quot;no objections to adding more voices to the council&quot; is factually an abstain, since it might support whatever form of expanding the council the other barons decide to fit best, but there is no favored position. Thus, no actual decision could be made.<br><br>A new nation – Since the Mords of the Confederation of Diskord are now members of the <a href="http://plort.wikia.com/wiki/Council_of_Plort">Council of Plort</a>, this nations existence has been acknowledged; no negotiation of borders was attempted.<br><br>A new barony – Since no negotiation of borders was attempted, Barony Eshakhar exists now within the borders as stipulated by the Edict of Bast.<br><br>The relocation of Barony Huinesoron – There was no opposition against Baron Huinesoron moving into eastern Borrd, but Baron Neshomeh objected to Baron Huinesoron taking possession of the parts of former Barony July east of the Larninkurv Mountains, claiming these lands for herself. After some discussion, Barons Huinesoron and Neshomeh agreed that they should both hold lands in the Riding of Sittorese, their border following the River Jid&#39;ryv from Goch&#39;t to Flayme, and its tributary Jid&#39;auks from there to the Larninkurvs. Barony Neshomeh now extends into the Riding, and the new Barony Huinesoron exists in eastern Borrd and in the Riding between Baronies Eshakhar and Neshomeh.<br><br>The disposition of Baron Huinesoron’s western territories – Barony Iximaz is unchanged.<br><br>In case Sar Iximaz did not want to expand her territories, Baron PC suggested to let him take baronial responsibility for the lands in western Diskord. This was supported by Baron Neshomeh, Baron Huinesoron and Sar Iximaz (actually speaking of all lands suggested to be placed under their control). Thus, Barony PC now includes western Diskord.<br><br>In case Sar Iximaz did not want to expand her territories, Baron Neshomeh further suggested to let the &quot;northern parts&quot; of Baron Huinesoron&#39;s former lands pass to Baron Phobos. (Since she agreed to let Protector Thomash represent the baronless nation of Ozerbord in the council, but opposed to the Beytahs of Sittorese representing the Riding that is already represented by its barons, she may not actually have attempted to expand her husband’s barony into Ozerbord, which would not get any support by other members of the Council.) Baron Neshomehs move was supported by Baron Huinsoron, specifying east of the Wattufs, and implicitly by Sar Iximaz not wanting any of those lands. Thus, Barony Phobos now extends to the Wattuf Mountains.<br><br>The status of the City of Borrd – Lacking any further discussion, the barons of the Council of Borrd obviously accepted their joint baronial authority over the City of Borrd.<br><br>The Warden of Spelin – Without objections Ye Scape-Grace is now the warden of the Temple of Spelin, but her claim to represent the will of the goddess in the Council was downright ignored.<br><br>New flags – The revised Union flag, based on the flags of the five nations, was accepted without dispute. <br><hr>

            <p>To be fair, Baron Huinesoron never mentioned the Meibot; he spoke of Barony July’s southern tip.

            <p>&quot;But even ignoring all details, like who exactly should be considered a Beytah of the Riding of Sittorese, or whether the Beytahs are truly representative of the Riders, only you and Baron Huinesoron are in favor of letting the Riding have a say in the council, while Baron Neshomeh and Baron PC clearly said no to any kind of representation other than through Barons who hold lands in the Riding.&quot;<br><br>The hermit moved uneasily in his armchair. &quot;In the case of Wechi, I’m afraid the details matter. Although I would appreciate to hear more voices in the council, I don’t see how what has been said could be twisted into a majority for one specific way of letting Wechi have a say in the Council.&quot; He sighed reluctantly. &quot;Anyway, the subject has been closed.&quot;<br><br>((Actually, you and Neshomeh <i>probably</i> supported Huinesorons original proposition, which wasn’t clear itself, but <i>probably</i> meant &quot;one vote for Protector Tomash, one vote for each Mord, one vote for each representative of the archivists of Wechi, and one vote for each Beytah of the Riding who bothers to show up at the Council&quot; ...<br><br>*** Thinking very hard *** Oh! Okay, I’m going to finish the intended argument first.<br><br>So, concerning the details, you and Neshomeh may, much to Baron Neshohmeh’s dismay, have outvoted Baron Huinesoron, who was tricked into saying that the delegates of Wechi should only get one collective vote for the nation they represent. You may also have outvoted Baron PC, who spoke against any form of representation for Wechi other than through Baron Neshomeh. But saying that you two outvoted both of them, because your opinions match and theirs don’t, would still be a stretch, and the keeper of the records won’t go there.<br><br>As long as we don’t agree that in-universe, everybody who took residence in Wechi is an archivist, making the archivists represent Wechi would collide with Wechi’s pure democracy, and supporting this would be OOC for Hieronymus the hermit. Also, since Baron Neshomeh only voted &quot;yes&quot; for domestic political reasons, by sabotaging Huinesoron’s attempt to expand the council further while in-character advocating more democracy, the archivist’s apprentice stealthily fulfills his master’s secret wish. <br><br>Only while typing this, I realized that <i>I</i> didn’t pay sufficient attention to the details. &quot;Let the archivists of Wechi send their representatives&quot; doesn’t actually require said representatives to be acknowledged Archivists. If I hadn’t manipulated Huinesoron, we would have a vote of three to one, and any denizen of Wechi could try to claim that they, by the Common Rule of Non-objection, are representatives of the archivists of Wechi . <br><br>Could I still tweak this, so that you and Neshomeh implicitly supported any more detailed specifications Huinesoron came up with only after you spoke? I guess it’s too late, and it doesn’t matter anyway. There is nobody else in sight who might have tried to speak for Wechi, and not being allowed to vote never stopped me.<br><br>HG))</p>

            <p>During the Ispace Wars, I looked around for old OFUs to borrow characters from, and the SWFFA was one I stole wholesale. Given that the original is long gone, I took certain liberties with it - I&#39;m pretty sure Leto didn&#39;t write himself as Lord Haven, and I&#39;m not sure he even had an author avatar in there. (Leto was, by the by, probably the first Permission Giver after the original trio of Cam, Bast, and Thalia.)<br><br>I&#39;ve had a couple of appearances from Lord Haven in the <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10306717/1/The-Ispace-Wars">Ispace Wars</a> itself, plus one <a href="http://ofudisc.blogspot.co.uk/2016/01/news-from-ofus-swffa-news-from-swffa.html">standalone appearance</a> set at the release of <i>The Force Awakens</i>. I did briefly consider writing a revived OFU for it... but decided against it just as quickly.<br><br>So for my part, I would be delighted to see you take up the mantle and start it off, either under Lord Haven, under new management, or as a second OFU (which has happened multiple times before, so don&#39;t feel shy about doing that).<br><br>hS</p>

Got a lot of it written out, and Alec&#39;s is first up. I plan to post the first of <i>those</i> soon...</p>

            <p>Haha, I&#39;ve been bit by the PPC bug again! You&#39;re right, they were all straight canonicals before, but Yikes™ that is so embarrassing these days, so I&#39;m tweaking some things. (There was part of the RP that actually was an Alec/Sam/O&#39;Neill love triangle, complete with pre-RP fanfic, though it wasn&#39;t quite like that.

            <p>My first draft of my first mission is ready at ~4000 words, and I&#39;m looking for betas for it. I should warn in advance that it is an <b><i><u>NSFW and NSFB Fire Emblem: Awakening fic containing incest and pedophilia</u></i></b>, and while I&#39;ve tried to tone things down in my sporking, it still shows through very clearly that this is a highly squicky fic. I don&#39;t think knowledge of the continuum is particularly necessary given how massively out of character everyone is, but it would still be appreciated.</p>

            <p>While I&#39;m a big fan of assassinations playing ironically,I find the twist you chose for this mission to be really interesting too. On a more personal note, I also like the way the part before the mission went. <br><br>I&#39;ll admit that I read the teaser a long time ago,but I remember Ave&#39;s lecture by Dawn, though fully deserved, was a more one-sided one, and appreciate the nuancing done. Oh, and of course, congratulations to the first supervillain of Middle-Earth, Sauroman. A clear win for him to brag about to Morgoth.<br><br>And discovering more abouut the other agents written by Zingenmir was also something I liked. Juggling with many characterrs and giving each of them their own identity is something really impressive.</p>

            <p><u>Baby Elf, Ent-queen</u><br>This mission had a few little details that I really liked.  Firstly, you guys did a good job of continuously reminding the reader of the disguises the agents were wearing at any given time.  This is especially important for me, as I have a tendency to keep reverting agents back to their normal appearance in my mental image of the story.  (Which gets especially silly with Zeb; no need for blue ion lions wandering around in Middle-earth!)  I also like the detail of having the notepad, writing utensil and weapon change forms between the Orc and Elf disguises.<br><br>I also really liked every time Agent Dawn started sharing things about Arda.  I&#39;m far from being a Tolkien expert myself, so I found all the knowledge and facts shared here interesting and informative.  The details about Elvish names at the end I found particularly fun.<br><br>The absolute best thing about this mission is the assassination fake-out.  There&#39;s not a single thing in the whole rest of the mission that made me think anything but a standard assassination was coming, which makes the surprise all the more wonderful and funny.  Even better than subverting the usual violent moment, you guys even turn it into an opportunity for some genuine cuteness, which helps to keep the three agents distracted from the awkwardness of their personal situation.  It&#39;s just a creative and fun twist, overall; well done, guys!<br><br>Happy Error List Time!  You may have already fixed some of these, &#39;cause I pulled this mission up on my phone days ago and only got to read it yesterday at lunch.  Anyway:<br><br>&quot;When it <b>did</b> down, a pair of fair-haired Elves were standing in their places.&quot;<br><br>&quot;The Sue stumbled to her little feet and promptly fell over, tripped by <b>her the</b> giant green dress . . .&quot;<br><br>&quot;The child thought about it, leaning her head against <b>Dawn</b> arm and frowning.&quot;<br>(Did a bottle of Dawn detergent just grow an arm?)<br><br>Also, this may have been intentional just to make that ending scene less complicated, but Gwilithiel switched from being in Zeb&#39;s RC at the start of the mission, to being back in Dawn&#39;s at the end.  I haven&#39;t read any <i>Pern</i> yet; I do know fire-lizards are pretty dang intelligent, but would it be able to get back into Dawn&#39;s RC on its own?  I don&#39;t think the Aviator knows where Dawn lives to help it . . .<br><br>Anyway, off to read the interlude . . .<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0wOD9TWynM">/reads interlude</a><br><br><u>Meeting the Exes</u><br>Oh.  Looks like fire-lizards can teleport.  Ignore that last comment in the previous section, then . . .<br><br>I enjoyed this mainly because it was almost a study in character interaction.  Exposing Zeb to new and unfamiliar personalities makes for all kinds of fun and unique dialogue interactions.  It just goes to show the wide variety of characters in Headquarters, and helps to make HQ feel like the bustling, populated place it ostensibly is.  Nothing majorly fancy or plot-changing happened, but I like it just for how down-to-earth and realistically conversational it is.<br><br>The one thing here I didn&#39;t get was the two separate references to Dawn not wearing nail polish.  It&#39;s been a while since I read other Dawn stories, so sorry if I&#39;m forgetting something already mentioned, but is the significance of her having plain fingernails?<br><br>—doctorlit, always plain-nailed</p>

            <p>The nail polish thing is that Dawn generally wears sparkly nail polish. Almost all the time. The interlude, however, is set shortly after Des got stuck in that suit of cybernetic armor, and she&#39;s not... completely happy or used to it yet. Des is also very unhappy at that point, which is adding to Dawn&#39;s unhappiness, and essentially her friends notice the lack of something she usually always wears and get a little worried.<br><br>~Z</p>

            <p>My imagination went immediately to a superhero in a dinosaur costume, or being an actual anthropomorphic dinosaur, haunting the mountains until the word world realizes that he is supposed to be Saruman and at Orthanc. I’m not fond of the inflationary spawning of minis at any opportunity, and the mini manifesting at Moria when Gandalf spoke its name at Caradhras is I bit too convenient for my taste. The need to catch the mini (and then watch Sauroman the raptor instead) might have been a reason to follow the fellowship, or to quickly portal there and back again. But then, Dawn and Zeb had more important stuff to do. <br><br><i>The agents trailed after the Fellowship <b>until they came to a stop at a short staircase. The Lady of Light appeared in front of them.</b></i><br>...<br><i>&quot;</i>Why <i>did they bring the</i> horse <i>up so many stairs? ... &quot;</i><br>What’s going on here? In the book, the fellowship climbed a long staircase to meet Galadriel and Celeborn. Since I don’t remember what was shown in the movie, the fanfic’s <b> short staircase</b> may actually be accurate to movieverse. But then, I don’t know much about horses, and even this might be too many steps. But then, it’s not even clear whether <b>The Lady of Light appeared</b> upstairs or downstairs. (Hey, it’s the Department of Inaccuracies trying to break through; don’t blame me.) Unfortunately, I didn’t take notes of a previous occurrence where Dawn appeared to base a comment on her memory of canon rather than on what had been told in the fanfic, and now I don’t find it again. Anyway, I’m snickering about the canon expert not actually paying attention to the boring fanfic, but I’m not sure whether I’m supposed to. Zeb wondering what &quot;many stairs&quot; Dawn is talking about might have helped to clarify that this is intentional – if it is.<br><br>Also, some typos:<br><br><i>The Sue stumbled to her little feet and promptly fell over, tripped by her the giant green dress ...</i><br>You need either &quot;her&quot; or &quot;the&quot;, but not both.<br><br><i>Zeb hesitated, them gingerly picked her up, unsure if he was supposed to cradle her or hold her at arm’s length.</i><br>&quot;them&quot; should be &quot;then&quot;.<br><br><i>The child thought about it, leaning her head against Dawn arm and frowning.</i><br>&quot;Dawn&quot; should be &quot;Dawn’s&quot;.<br><br>Overall, this was a fun read. The end of the mission was unexpected but sweet, and I liked Dawn and Zeb’s pre- and post-mission interactions with the Aviator.<br><br>HG</p>

            <p>I go by Diana online but you can call me whatever you like, really. Seventeen year old girl born, raised and living in Argentina, so I&#39;m a native spanish-speaker.<br>I came across the PPC wiki while searching for ways to avoid writing Mary-Sues, my most dreaded fear, and then procedeed to read as many articles as I could in one night. And a day. And another night. And it&#39;s just been like that for the past week. For now I&#39;ve read the Original Series, the Constitution, and some missions I&#39;ve found on the Board (can i say very quickly that I love Ix and Charlotte? Both are amazing characters).<br>Also I wanted to know if the PPC works in anything other than English, if there are any missions written in spanish or if there&#39;s any kind of translated website in the case someone who doesn&#39;t know that much english wants to join.<br>I think that&#39;s it, but I probably missed something, so just ask if there&#39;s anything else you want to know.</p>

            <p>Hello there and welcome to the PPC! I&#39;m Twistey, an uberchaotic neutral lightly-used-bie, and I am currently learning Spanish, so I might ask you a couple things about the language. I am in a ton of fandoms, mainly because I get dragged into fandoms so easily (the most recent example of that being my being dragged into the Camp Camp fandom by my IRL friend), but I tend to focus most on fandoms that have good world-building, given how much I love creating fan content and OCs, as well as fandoms that can be taken lightly.<br><br>I don&#39;t know if there are PPC things in languages other than English, but I&#39;ll see if the oldbies would be okay with starting translated Wikis.<br><br>Do you have any characters who you want to make into agents? I&#39;d love to read about them and give any critiques I have! Nice to meet you, Diana!<br><br>-Twistey</p>

            <p>Ask whatever! (Is that correct?) I&#39;d love to help, although if  you are curious about a paricular expression it may vary a lot between countries; is there a specific &quot;type&quot; (from Spain, Latinamerica, or a particular country) of spanish you are learning/interested in?<br><br> Same here on being dragged to fandoms easily. It&#39;s not really that hard to catch my interest, but I think the characters make the story, so the ones that I stick to are those with well-written characters. Good world-building is a plus (and it makes my attempts at fanarts somewhat easier).<br><br>About the agents, uh, not right now. I don&#39;t think most of my OC&#39;s are agent material. I played with the idea of someone unwillingly getting dragged by a friend or someone to the PPC and being &quot;forced&quot; to join (more like confused to the point of accepting without really understanding what they were getting into) due to the lack of personal, and therefore very reluctantly taking on missions, mainly obliged to by their partner, but I don&#39;t know how that situation would play in the PPC or if it could happen, and I&#39;m not thinking very seriously about it. For now, at least; I have no rush. Do you have any potential agents? Who are they? I&#39;d love to know.<br><br>Nice to meet you too!<br>Diana.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m not too sure which &quot;type&quot; of Spanish I am most interested in learning, but so far I&#39;ve learned kind of a mishmash, since the various tutors I&#39;ve had have been teaching me different things. I may just end up asking a lot about whatever kind of Spanish my teacher will be teaching when I&#39;m back in school. (Which will be Wednesday. Woo.)<br><br>Yeah! The characters themselves are what cause me to really like the fandom, although I still make OCs of fandoms that have good world-building but turn me off character wise (which for me would be Homestuck, Steven Universe, and other stuff like that.) Of course, I also make &quot;walking MST&quot; OCs for fandoms that I consider all-around absurd. (WinX Club.) I just really like making characters, for some reason.<br><br>Interesting idea with the being dragged into the PPC thing, although it does seem kind of legally iffy in the sense that the character agreed to something without completely understanding what they were getting into. (Gah, I&#39;ve been spending too much time on Springhole.net, I&#39;m starting to sound like a law student. Which does not mean that Springhole.net is a bad site, by the way.) Although I&#39;m not sure that PPC stuff has to be completely legal, given that sometimes the Laws of Narrative Comedy and other &quot;laws&quot; preside over actual laws in PPC stories, or get mixed up with actual laws (maybe that&#39;s more on the Board... but enough about my personal grievances.)<br><br>As for potential agents of mine, I have four (not counting the two other strange &quot;hired mercenary&quot; characters who do a PPC-like job but work independently.) The group consists of three siblings and their close friend, and the two older siblings and the friend all have some sort of superpowers, which leads the youngest sibling to channel his efforts into science-type things. They will always be found together (minus whoever has to go do something at the moment), and the middle sibling and the friend are (going to be) partners in DOGA, so those missions will be done by both of them. The friend is the girly-girl, the middle sibling is the tomboy, the youngest sibling is the guy who&#39;s quiet until the subject turns to something he&#39;s interested in in which case he will never stop talking, and the oldest sibling is pretty much GLaDOS (except less sadistic), which is why I&#39;m putting her into DOA. The youngest sibling is in one of those science departments (I don&#39;t remember what it&#39;s called, but it has something to do with researching and experimenting on Mary Sues. Oh wait, that&#39;s pretty much what the name is.)<br><br>My brain is kind of shorting out right now, so that description may be a bit confusing. Let me know if you want clarifications!<br><br>-Twistey</p>

            <p>Sorry I got back so late. I hope school wasn&#39;t all that bad by the way. <br>Ooh~ I would love to read some of it, specially on Steven Universe since I&#39;ve always regarded them as simple (if sometimes a bit flat) and lovable characters, so it would be nice to see them from someone else&#39;s point of view (and to read some good stuff since most fanfics try to make Steven &quot;complex&quot; by having him angst).<br>Yeah, you&#39;re right. Maybe it could be interesting to add that &quot;legally iffyness&quot; as a personality trait, but probably for something more serious. I&#39;m not giving it a lot of thought, I prefer to read a little more missions and spin-offs before. On a side note, I love springhole.net, in fact, right now I have 26 tabs (yeah, I&#39;m that kind of person) open on my phone to read when I have some time. (They have so many characterisation tips! And so many links! It&#39;s adictive).<br>On your agents, I&#39;m assuming they are all from the same canon (correct me if I&#39;m wrong) so where are they from? And what kind of superpowers do they have?<br>Diana, </p>

            <p>As for the Spanish thing, I think that, for a non-English speaker to understand the PPC, I would have to translate not only the Original Series, but  also at least some of the Wiki articles and spin-offs, and I&#39;m not that confident in my English yet nor do I have the time right now, though I would like to do something to make it more available eventually. Thanks again!</p>

            <p>My problems are more with vocabulary, I tend to stick to the same group of words. Word puzzles and typical expressions are hell for me, and I could never tell apart British English from American (in writings) if my life depended on it (say; flat versus appartment, mate, the only examples I know. No, actually, gotta and got to, since I always mess those two up in English class). It means a lot though, specially coming from a Boarder.</p>

            <p>The best way to improve your vocabulary in any language? Just hurl yourself into it.

            <p>A Kuroko no Basuke and Mount and Blade crossover. It is quite a challenge. I have to rearrange the characters around to keep their relationships canon to the manga and anime. And then there&#39;s a ton, and  I mean A TON of characters in M&amp;B, and I can&#39;t fit them all in without feeling it was shoehorned. <br><br>What was the fandom of your old fic? Is it Potterverse? And good luck with original stuff. For some reason I can&#39;t make new original stories.</p>

            <p>I remember these guys. :D<br><br>I think this is an idea the Flowers wouldn&#39;t go for in 2017, but 2003 - at the height of the Fanfic Explosion - I can see it. And if it all goes spectacularly wrong, they only lose, like, one agent, right? Win/win!<br><br>~<br><br>On an unrelated note: when did you actually join the PPC? 2003-dated people are pretty rare around here, even the ones who left for a while and then came back. Any idea what time of year you showed up?<br><br>(From my records, it looks like you were here in 2015 for a bit, 2010-2012 on and off, 2008 for a while, and... were you GreenCat3?

            <p>Since I don&#39;t have the time, talent, or motivation to put work into getting Permission, and I&#39;ve been pretty bored for the last week or so, I decided I might as well go back to one of my favorite genres of fic-sporking from when I first got into the PPC. Namely- MSTing.<br><br>I now present to you the exploits of Kitty and Ruby as they mock a Sue&#39;s tragic lack of Heelies, get pedantic about capitalization of proper nouns, and butcher Shakespeare in their attempt to survive <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hchwrSIp-LkMFTQRW2kZKjX01bmSpVMDIviS9aAUNNc/edit?usp=sharing">&quot;The Slytherin Princess&quot;</a>.<br><br>Wow, this got a lot longer than expected. Enjoy!<br><br>-Kitty</p>

            <p>Yeah, I was wondering if a PPCer could do stuff with their characters before getting permission if the characters aren&#39;t agents yet and aren&#39;t sporking. I needed the info because I&#39;m in the middle of an over-text RP with an IRL friend in which I play an alternate version one of my pre-agents (and by alternate version I mean a version in which she doesn&#39;t even know that the PPC exists), to help me get a good first draft of her personality. A first draft. The RP has become incredibly weird, so I&#39;m pretty sure she won&#39;t act as an agent like she does as a weirdly RP&#39;d civilian.<br><br>Anyway, I&#39;m bookmarking your MST so I can read it later and laugh with your characters at the badfic. MSTs are one of my favorite things in the world. Hooray!<br><br>-Twistey</p>

            <p>An imaginary friend character!  I&#39;m actually planning to make an entire RC of all the talking animal imaginaries I had as a kid, though it will largely be a background joke, and not a proper spin-off.<br><br>. . . Yeah, not much to say content-wise, being an MST.  Um, on to the typos I caught?<br><br>First, a couple general notes.  The titles of canons in your author&#39;s note at the beginning should be italicized.  (Or in this case, <i>not</i> italicized to set them apart from all the italicized text around them.)<br><br>Pauses in writing shown with a line instead of a comma should use a long dash rather than a hyphen:<br>&quot;&#39;S—okay, I’m out of affectionate nicknames, can we maybe stop this now?&#39; The other girl—her name was Kitty—ran a hand through her messy hair. &#39;Also, people might be getting the wrong impression.&#39;&quot;<br>Sadly, U.S. keyboards don&#39;t actually have that as a key. <br> On the Board and other places that use html-based coding, you can make them by filling in the space with &amp; mdash ; but without any spaces.  On GDocs and Word docs, you have to go through the Insert --&gt; Symbol rigmarole, or just copy-and-paste them.<br><br>Note that you don&#39;t need to change the hyphens in adjectival phrases, or other word phrases strung together into a single complex word; you&#39;re already using those correctly:<br>&quot;&#39;. . . while sporking fics that we found bad and-slash-or amusing . . .&#39;&quot;<br><br>&quot;&#39;I kinda wish we were Agents,&#39; Kitty said . . .&quot;<br>No need for that capital &quot;A&quot; there.  As far as the PPC goes, &quot;agent&quot; only gets the capital &quot;A&quot; when it&#39;s a title in front of an agent&#39;s name; otherwise, it&#39;s just a common noun.<br><br>&quot;&#39;. . . he wasn’t happy the insubordination of his own nose . . .&#39;&quot;<br>You&#39;re missing a preposition between &quot;happy&quot; and &quot;the.&quot;<br><br>—doctorlit also uses long dashes to sign his name, clearly</p>

            <p>Draco is not smooth with the ladies. He is from the lineage of sandpapers, who married into the oldest and noblest families of sharkskin, whose legendary ancestors had been hailed as the best whetstones in the universe, and he had received solid gold medals for the Most Abrasive Stone Polisher of The Year.
