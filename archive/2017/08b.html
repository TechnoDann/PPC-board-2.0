            <p>Hey! I read this fantastic book called Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell! <a href="http://www.jonathanstrange.com/"><a href="http://www.jonathanstrange.com/">http://www.jonathanstrange.com/</a></a><br><br>So, after some digging, there doesn&#39;t seem to be much of a fandom. Not even a wikia site! So, this is both a shoutout post to the book and the TV adaptation, and me looking for fans! Has anyone read or heard about it?</p>

            <p>Let me introduce you to some lesser known mangas.<br><br>Historie: A story about this Scythian guy, named Eumenes, who chronicles the rise of Macedonian Empire from the father, King Philip, to possibly his son, Alexander the Great. Takes some creative licenses, especially about Alexander&#39;s psychology.<br><br>Origin: A robot story. Apparently, even as a robot, you need to have money to repair yourself. Facing his &#39;brothers&#39;, he will have to ensure his own survival. By hook or by crook.<br><br>Vinland Saga: I may be tooting the war horn to the guests of Valhalla and Folkvangr here. But if you are a fan of history and Vikings, you must read this. Thorfinn Karlsefni has a dream. To make a new place, where you can live in peace. This place is called Farmland. Well, Vinland, but you get the idea. Right now, every warrior wants to 1 on 1 against him, but he has resolved not to resort to violence ever again. How did he escape from the challenges? How can he reach Miklagarth in time and get the funds needed for his project? And will the crossbowwoman ever kill him? Tune in to find out.<br><br>I think these mangas may be less obscure than I thought, but if it tickles your curiosity, then I have done my work. </p>

            <p>A few years ago I came across a webcomic which, aside from its TVTropes page, seems to have little reference on the web. It&#39;s called 1/0 (<a href="http://www.undefined.net/1/0/?strip=1"><a href="http://www.undefined.net/1/0/?strip=1">http://www.undefined.net/1/0/?strip=1</a></a>), and it&#39;s probably one of the best instances of metafiction I&#39;ve ever seen. And I&#39;ve seen a lot of metafiction. This comic explores the concept with unbelievable throughness, and managed to remain pretty funny in the process. This thing should be a certified classic, but I don&#39;t know if anyone&#39;s even heard of it.</p>

            <p>I personally can&#39;t spork this story since I don&#39;t have permission yet, but I&#39;m glad you&#39;re interested in having an old story sporked! Why? Well, part of why I&#39;m replying to you is because I also have written badfic in past times, and once I have a Wattpad account, I&#39;ll post up the badfics for sporking. And maybe let people spork them multiple times, or MST them - basically they&#39;ll be perpetual writing practice exercises. But anyway, since your post hasn&#39;t really been getting responses, I just want to acknowledge your Suefic&#39;s existence. Maybe you should put it on the Unclaimed Badfic page to give it more attention. I&#39;m not the most sure how it all works, so maybe ask an older-than-me-bie.<br><br>-Twistey</p>

The entirety of the ship seemed to wait with bated breath, every detail in place, every hallway swept and gleaming.<br><br>Yes, the ISD <i>Refiner</i> was almost ready.<br><br>The same could not be said of its occupants.<br><br>“For the last time, boy, <i>stop following me!</i>” Darth Vader hissed, one hand on his lightsaber, the other pointed squarely at the mask of his grandchild. <br><br>“But—but Grandfather,” Kylo Ren said, edging forward slightly, trying—for the third time that hour—to proffer his own lightsaber, “Uncle Luke said you would sign it for me.”<br><br>“He lied,” the dark lord said. His finger shifted targets, moving from the erstwhile Solo child to the uniformed figure that had just walked onto the bridge. “<i>You,</i>” Vader said, his voice well into what any Imperial officer knew as “the death zone.” “I demand you return me to the SWFFA grounds immediately. They know how to treat a Lord of the Sith.” His grip on his lightsaber tightened, the leather of his glove creaking. <br><br>“Yep, nope, ain’t happening,” the figure said, her flippant tone contrasting sharply with the neat lines of her white uniform. “Lord Haven and SWFFA are going to be under repairs for quite a while yet. Until then, you and everyone else are stuck in here with me.” She grinned with far too much impudence for someone facing an irate Darth Vader. “Besides, this place will be filled to the gills with shrill, annoying fanwriters by this time tomorrow. You’ll have <i>plenty</i> of ways to vent your anger then.” She sat down in the command chair, ignoring Vader’s hiss of frustration as she scanned the datapad mounted on the arm. “Admiral Piett,” she asked, glancing to the side. <br><br>The admiral had been doing his best to become one with the background, but now, most unwillingly, stepped forward. “Yes, er, Tai’shar?” he asked, stumbling over the odd name. <br><br>“Coordinator Tai’shar, please,” she said. “At least until I find a better title. I don’t want the fanwriters getting into bad habits. Speaking of, send me that updated list of badficcers, if you would. I want to look over our new… recruits.”<br><br>“Aye, Coordinator,” Piett said, turning to his own datapad and tapping it a few times. “List sent.” He stepped back once more, doing his best to avoid any further attention.<br><br>“Thank you, Admiral.” Resting her chin on her hand, Tai’shar paged through the list, mentally tuning out the background noise of Kylo Ren’s next attempt at gaining Vader’s signature. It was the usual mix of plausible names, heartily implausible names, and rip-offs of canon characters. She determined, there and then, that every third fanwriter with numbers in their name would be immediately re-assigned to trash compactor cleaning duty, a duty she had, there and then, made up. <br><br>She took a deep breath and let it out slowly, still scanning the list. “This,” she said, over the sound of Darth Vader’s lightsaber activating, “is going to be interesting.”<br><br>----------------------------------------------------------<br><br>In other words, badficcer personas: I need &#39;em!<br><br>To be more clear, this is the &quot;registration&quot; thread for the Star Wars Fan Fiction Academy, Secondary Location (otherwise known as SWFFA2). If you&#39;ve written Star Wars badfic and want to register your previous badficcer self, or if you just like the idea of being in an OFU and want to create a badficcer self, post &#39;em below! They can be as much like or unlike you as you wish.

            <p><br>Name: Calls herself Estrelya Chara.

Her eyes have the look of gorgeous, polished emeralds, and are very quick to notice details.<br><br>Can most often be seen in flowing robes in various shades of blue or purple. That is, she would if the OFU would let her, and she&#39;s not very good at not tripping in them.<br><br>Weapon of Choice (this wasn&#39;t actually on the application but she filled it out anyway): A special staff, one end of which paralyzes any machinery it touches, and the other end emits a cutting laser (no, she doesn&#39;t actually have any training with this thing- she just made it up for a story of hers).  <br><br>Lust Object (if applicable): Anakin Skywalker (Darth Vader counts too- she just loves redemption arcs) <br><br>Light Side/Dark Side: Was a jedi, before leaving the order as it was growing too stagnant.

They&#39;re actually gray.<br><br>She&#39;s currently an alien because she didn&#39;t take the OFU application seriously (she thought it was just going to be a fun online roleplay) and wrote her idealized Star Wars self into it. She was rather surprised when she discovered that she was turned into a Togruta, and had to learn how to be one from scratch.<br><br>Enjoys wearing a golden Togruta montral-dress she made herself (it&#39;s actually just craft paper and cardboard, painted gold).</p>

            <p>Let&#39;s fix that!<br><br>Name: Si&#39;Thar&#39;Liss Ren-Vader!!<br><br>Age: 17!!! Like Bella :)) &lt;3 &lt;3 (:<br><br>Species: a beautiful mostly-human princess with the potential to be THE MOST POWERFUL SITH LORD EVER EVEN MORE THAN KYLO AND VADER AND THAT EMPEROR GUY (also has cat ears and a dragon tail and butter-fly wings~!!)<br><br>Description: a gorgeous young woman, five foot six, with fancily braided mid-length black hair, vivid emerald eyes, and a lot of useful muscle. She doesn&#39;t use the Force for *everything*!! Also, the cat ears, dragon tail, and wings from the last section! Oh, and she wears something kind of like Rey&#39;s outfit, except sturdier and in black and forest green (to accent her eyes. Also, a complete lack of color is boring). <br><br>Lust Object (if applicable): OH MU GOD KYLO REN IS TEH HOTTEST and also Casslian Anderthingy&#39;s pretty cool with that accent but KYLO REN AL THE EWAY!!!<br><br>(Okay, and Finn. Finn&#39;s cute. But he&#39;s light side, so it&#39;d never work out...right? :D)<br><br>Light Side/Dark Side: Dark Side. OBVIOUSLY. (But, like, with feelings!) [[Yeah, that&#39;s a vague Starkid reference that I put in for my own amusement and, in hindsight, because she would&#39;ve seen the shows and loved them.]]<br><br>Notes: Yeah, this is meant to be a fairly generic overblown Kylo Ren fangirl badficcer persona. I will be so very happy if her &quot;butter-fly&quot; wings end up not like a butterfly&#39;s but rather like the bread-and-butter-flies that I vaguely remember from Through The Looking-glass--they look exactly like the name describes. I&#39;d also be very happy, however, if she didn&#39;t turn out to be as silly in personality as she seems here--she&#39;s more of a quiet person with reasonable intelligence and good SPaG skills in her actual writing. She just has a tendency towards extreme silliness in fandom conversations and overblown, under researched plotlines in the Star Wars universe, which isn&#39;t actually her primary canon--that would be Harry Potter, which she knows quite well even if she has come out with the occasional unpublished Sue plot for it. (She&#39;s not exactly me...but she does have some elements of me at fourteen. I left off the bit about the Dark Side having brownies, though--it&#39;s a different Dark Side anyway, I should think.)<br><br>She consumes pretty much all media right now, good and bad, and hasn&#39;t quite grown up enough to tell the difference consistently (hence having Twilight on the list). She often doesn&#39;t catch the faults or unfortunate implications yet. Despite this, she can have a pretty intelligent conversation about Harry Potter or Tamora Pierce&#39;s books or Lloyd Alexander&#39;s books, not to mention some non-fandom topics.<br><br>She&#39;ll probably be put off by meeting people who act in real life the way she sounds in this application. Despite that, I&#39;m sure she&#39;d join in half the time once she&#39;s over the shock.</p>

The dulcet tones of all those well-spoken British actors might make him a little bit weak in the knees, though. And, well, Han Solo.

I say that&#39;s because he grew up in a time much less accepting of geeks and he had no friends to be an obnoxious little Trekkie at.<br><br>Also, I don&#39;t think Cuthaan (or whatever he ends up being called) actually has the full-blown memory thing; Nume&#39;s is really sort of sci-fi. Cuthaan probably just likes <i>Sherlock</i> and has a rudimentary mind palace.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

Tends to wear dark suits.  Brown eyes.<br><br>Lust Object: Far too old to be thinking about that any more.<br><br>Notes: So, I&#39;m trying something a little different here.  Nicholas is a PPC agent, DIC-Sci Fi/Steampunk Division, unpartnered.  I&#39;ll be needing him in a future, planned story-line, but don&#39;t really know what he&#39;s up to at the moment.  His motivation for enrolling in this OFU is that: even though he watched the classic trilogy in his youth on World One, and eventually saw the prequels, his mission schedule of frequently being sent with other agent pairs into the field has prevented him from seeing the newer movies, watching through the <i>Clone Wars</i> materials, playing any games, or reading the various comics and novels.  Finding that it&#39;s beginning to affect his work, and chafing at the fact that he needs to rely on younger colleagues for info on a canon that was part of his own childhood, he finally decided to take advantage of OFU time shenanigans to get fully caught up on <i>Star Wars</i>.  The only thing I ask is that you don&#39;t get him romantically involved with anyone.  Otherwise, I leave him to you!<br><br>Unless you don&#39;t want to deal with my weirdness, of course.  Feel free to disregard this submission if you&#39;re not into the idea.  :)<br><br>—doctorlit, OFUing for the first time</p>

            <p>Name: Esclarmonde d&#39;Occitanie<br><br>Age: 21<br><br>Species: French-Cathar<br><br>Description: The daughter of a Cathar Jedi and a temporo-spatially displaced heir to the county of Foix, Esclarmonde has blonde hair down to her mid-back, hazel eyes, and a frankly unfortunate dress sense, in that she favours gowns of a decidedly medieval cut which do not entirely lend themselves to running about doing Jedi-ish things. They don&#39;t go with her very pale champagne fur either, but that hasn&#39;t stopped her yet. Despite the presence at her side of the technological wonder that is a lightsabre, she has taken vows of humility before the eyes of her father&#39;s God, owning very little else save the clothes on her back and the barest minimum she needs to exist. She drills relentlessly in an adulterated version of classical Shien that also pulls techniques from her father&#39;s training in High European longsword fencing (something she calls the Way of the Falling Dove), but only when she is not in prayer to God or meditating upon the Force. She eats little, sleeps less, and considers herself utterly dedicated to the life of a Jedi.<br><br>If only she knew she was the product of a pun based on an obscure religious sect from medieval Carcassonne.<br><br>Lust Object (if applicable): N/A<br><br>Light Side/Dark Side: Light side.<br><br>Notes: Esclarmonde (do not shorten it) is, despite her professions of piety, an inveterate snob, largely ignoring the plight of the people in order to focus on moral and theological problems as well as continue to master her lightsabre. She is, according to medieval notions of morality, a good and decent person; by our standards, she&#39;s a Bible-thumping martinet so far up her own backside she practically walks by somersault.</p>

            <p>Name: Tom Booker<br><br>Age: 26<br><br>Species: Human<br><br>Description: A pudgy, speccy little sad-sack with more pimples than friends and very, very clear skin, at least in his words. However, he&#39;s not actually <i>that</i> terrible, just overweight and with the unfortunate lack-of-hairstyle common to people for whom hair is just something that gets in the way. Yes, he&#39;s overweight and views exercise the same way other people look at a plague bacillus, wears big thick NHS glasses held together mostly with hope, and has a wispy, irritating beard and moustache dyed orange from his crippling addiction to Wotsits, but he&#39;s not a bad person. Just a singularly unprepossessing one. He looks like he&#39;d be the sort of person who&#39;d get very into men&#39;s rights activism, only he&#39;s at least vaguely acquainted with the concept of basic human decency. Tom is generally found in tracksuit bottoms and a Star Wars fandom tee in many shades of mysterious-food-stain-on-black, and writes terrible fanfiction centred on his OC as a means of escape from his job as a from-home data entry schlub.<br><br>He&#39;s sculpted this OC like Pygmalion did Galataea, drawing on his knowledge of the Star Wars continuum and his History degree to form a wonderful character. One he has, if he&#39;s being honest with himself, fallen in love with a bit. Actually, a lot. I mean, she&#39;s taken vows of chastity, he&#39;s actually a real person, but if they were both around he&#39;s sure it could work. So what if the other characters in the fic are drawn in strokes so broad they resemble a twelve-lane Autobahn? She&#39;s the important one.<br><br>He&#39;s commissioned fanart of her as well, standing proud in her medieval attire, lightsabre in hand, champagne-furred ears poking out from a cascade of golden hair. He has that picture above his bed, as a reminder that there&#39;s still creativity left in him, and in the world. Tom really does love her...<br><br>His Esclarmonde.<br><br>Lust Object: Sylvar, Esclarmonde<br><br>Light/Dark Side: Light side, obviously.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m going to send in the kid I was when I wrote SW badfic. Now the Board gets to learn that I&#39;ve <i>always</i> been as messed up as I am now! Huzzah!<br><br>...actually, I was less messed up back then.<br><br>----<br><br>Name: Twistey<br><br>Age: Around 10 or so<br><br>Description: Twistey is really really really into Star Wars, and puts references to it into everything she does, but is not a stickler for canon details. Minecraft comes in a close second. Rather than doing anything with the Star Wars canon, Twistey is oft to write fics that have premises centered around the Force and other Star Wars things existing in real life or in Minecraft, fics that star a self-insert protagonist and sometimes friend-inserts too. Her writing is safe for work and for the brain, but it will just plain not make sense, 100% guaranteed. She has a huge, inexplicable obsession with villains in general, resulting in a kind of &quot;deadly innocence&quot; that prevents her from understanding the real consequences of the dark side and other things. Luckily, she doesn&#39;t post her work on the Internet, not having discovered fanfiction sites, or even the term fanfiction, yet.<br><br>Lust Object (if applicable): None! However, she does idolize Emperor Palpatine/Darth Sidious as a mentor figure.<br><br>Light Side/Dark Side: I don&#39;t think even she knows. On one hand, she considers herself to be a follower of the Sith creed (but in reality is even more of a wannabe than Kylo Ren), but on the other hand, the protagonists of her fics were either Jedi or fighting against a &quot;dark side&quot; of something.<br><br>Notes: If you want to, you can make &quot;Twizzy logic&quot; a running joke when writing her. It&#39;s probably good that you refer to her as &quot;Twizzy&quot; or &quot;Twizz&quot; or some other nickname, in order to distinguish her from the present-day version, which is me. Also, the &quot;deadly innocence&quot; thing is just about fictitious villains. I hadn&#39;t learned the worst yet.<br><br>------<br><br>My brain is kind of fried right now so I&#39;m having trouble thinking of more things to say about little Twizz. Let me know if you have any more questions or suggestions for things to put down.<br><br>-Twistey</p>

            <p>The badfic personas are supposed to be sonas, not the actual writer. Hmm, let me see.<br><br>Name: Teyori Visalia<br><br>Age: 13<br><br>Description: Teyori is a Padawan-turned-Sith-apprentice who is skilled in dark side powers, mostly because she likes using them better than her lightsaber. She is capable of Force lighting from training with her mentor, Darth Sidious, and often plays with it a little in order to take advantage of the appearance-tweaking abilities it supposedly has on herself and her enemies. (No, Twizzy, that&#39;s not the conclusion you should be drawing from the incident with The Emperor getting his lightning deflected back at him.) As such, the culmination of all the non-canon lightning is her ghostly pale skin, skeletal-looking face, impressive height, shoulder-length black hair hanging over the left eye, and sunken-in red catlike eyes. Her usual attire is the standard black Sith robes, usually with the hood up, with a black tunic, pants, and boots underneath. She speaks with a slight British accent and suppresses outward signs of her emotions unless in combat, in which the full extent of her rage and maniacal happiness are presented.<br><br>Lust object: None.<br><br>Light Side/Dark Side: Dark side, but isn&#39;t actually likely to actually kill anyone or do any real damage. She just scares people more than anything else.<br><br>Notes: None, I think.<br><br>---<br><br>Question: Am I allowed to add in another character based on an IRL friend of mine as she was during the time I would write these sorts of characters? I don&#39;t know if I can get her permission, but I kind of want the two to have some nice long banter sessions.<br><br>-Twistey</p>

            <p>I guess I&#39;ll make a badficcer out of my friend at that age; although she does write questionablequalityfic currently, she&#39;d probably agree that her fics back then weren&#39;t as good.<br><br>How would the in-universe application be presented? More of &quot;yourself&quot; or more of &quot;yourself as a Star Wars character&quot;? Because if it&#39;s a &quot;yourself&quot; thing, she probably would be honest about herself (the only questionable detail being considering herself a follower of the dark side), but if it were a &quot;yourself as a Star Wars character&quot;, she&#39;d basically do as you said and insert the descriptions of Teyori into her application. As the race, it would be human in both cases, albeit altered by the dark side in the latter case. So what do you think is closer to how the application would actually work?<br><br>Anyway, here&#39;s my friend as a badficcer:<br>Name: Avice (that is neither her name nor her Internet pseudonym, because I&#39;m nice.)<br><br>Age: Around 11<br><br>Chosen Race: Human<br><br>Description: Avice is really really really into high fantasy, and as such, writes Star Wars like it&#39;s Dungeons and Dragons. She is guilty of coming up with suspiciously cleric-esque Jedi and new Force abilities that really don&#39;t fit the genre of sci-fi. And prophecies, musical numbers with original songs, and Mary Sues. She even invented an entirely new order of Force users! Anyway, this kid is a bit more like typical badficcers than Twizzy is.<br><br>Lust Object (if applicable): Unknown, but probably has one.<br><br>Light Side/Dark Side: Light side, duh!<br><br>Notes: The banter between Twizzy and Avice is not fanfiction-oriented like the banter between present-day Avice and I, but rather more similar to two friends who have different favorite sports teams and have banter about who&#39;s the better team. Occasionally they will engage in mock duels.<br><br>How Avice Would Create a Sona (just in case we want to combine Teyori with Twizzy):<br><br>Name: Shaiata Siraelian<br><br>Age: 20<br><br>Description: Shaiata is a Jedi Knight of great skill, perhaps surpassing Anakin in her abilities and definitely being one to discover new things the Force can do. Yoda mentored her even though he is deceased at this time, through appearing to her in her dreams (something she later learned to harness and use for communication with other Force users via meditation.) She often receives prophecies in this manner, and is destined to do half a dozen great things that bring balance to the Force yada yada. At one point in time, she had a Padawan named Teyori, who she greatly misses and wishes to guide back to the light side. She has flowing, golden blonde hair, deep blue eyes, and fair skin, and wears the traditional Jedi robe ensemble. Her lightsaber is sapphire blue. This is similar to how Teyori would have looked pre-Sithhood if Avice had had her way with writing her, but Twizzy insisted on giving Teyori a less idealized appearance by basing that appearance on herself.<br><br>Lust Object: Secretly, another Jedi.<br><br>Notes: Somehow, despite being on opposite sides of the Force, Teyori and Shaiata (like their authors) are still friends. This will probably be how it is for the rest of eternity, as both are too stubborn to listen to the other&#39;s attempts to bring them to their side.<br><br>---<br><br>Let me know if there&#39;s anything else you&#39;d want to know!<br><br>-Twistey</p>

            <p>Name: Tango Dioxide<br><br>Age: Exactly as old as <i>Star Wars</i> itself. She&#39;d rather not think about how old that is. (She&#39;s 40.)<br><br>Description: Human. Redhead - I mean <i>red</i>, not ginger. PPC agent. Her handful of scars aren&#39;t from missions, though - they&#39;re from spending most of a decade on the run.<br><br>Lust Object: Well, she&#39;s married (to Steve, he&#39;s a bit wet), but... well, she had a bit of a Thing for Luke Skywalker back in the day. (Though he&#39;s too young for her now, obviously.)<br><br>Alignment: Grey. When she and Blue discovered the Mary-Sue Factory, he spent the next year in jail for trying to speak out; Tango accepted reassignment and kept her mouth shut.<br><br>Notes: Tango is applying because her partner, Nyx, lived in the <i>Star Wars</i> &#39;verse on and off for seven years, and Tango is fed up of being the less knowledgeable one.<br><br><hr>
<br><br>Name: Sha-Non Smi&#39;ith<br><br>Age: Ten thousand and seventeen. Or just seventeen.<br><br>Description: Jediiiii~! kk so Sha-Non was this super talented Jedi trainee ten thousand years ago but then she was FROZEN IN CARBONITE ten thousand years ago and only woken up, like, last week. Or at least that&#39;s what she tells anybody; it may just be an excuse to use bad(e) old(e) English(e), or do we mean Basic(e)?<br><br>Also she&#39;s a dog-girl, which is like a catgirl but for dogs instead. (I believe there are several species of these around <i>Star Wars</i>, but she doesn&#39;t know that.)<br><br>Lust Object: Rey and Jyn Erso, though there is a <i>distinct</i> possibility that she doesn&#39;t realise they&#39;re actually different people.<br><br>Alignment: Liiiiight~!<br><br>Notes: She has a lightsaber. It is pink. That should tell you everything you need to know about her.<br><br><hr>
<br><br>I think I got a bit tangled between &#39;badfic writer&#39; and &#39;self-insert&#39; there. In reality, her name is Shannon Smith (... yup), and she&#39;s a seventeen-year-old dog-loving Canadian who writes <i>prolifically</i> and without reference to anything except her own memories of the films.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>But do OFUs also take &#39;volunteer&#39; students? I mean people who may consider begin writing fanfic, or writing fics good enough already, but want to get better at this?

            <p>I&#39;m not sure if there&#39;s any official rule about it, but the main obstacle would be the fact that fanwriters don&#39;t know about the OFUs until they actually receive the invitation to register. I suppose you could explain it as someone who has connections with the PPC voluntarily submitting an application; if you want to make a fanwriter like that, I&#39;d have no objections. <br><br>-Alleb</p>

            <p>Guess I&#39;ll go for two characters then, volunteer and classic badficcer.<br><br>Name: Gerald Richards<br><br>Age: 23<br><br>Description: Human with brown curly hair, blue eyes, rather tall and slightly skinny. Is also a bit short-sighted, but he doesn&#39;t know if glasses exist in Star Wars, so... Generally stays quiet, except if buttons are pushed or excited. Don&#39;t exactly draws attention to him. Still has a somehow snarky sense of humor.<br><br>Lust Object (if applicable): Not really. Visiting an enjoying this &#39;verse is a much better way to go.<br><br>Light Side/Dark Side: Light Side here, although he want to go for &#39;greyer&#39; things (consider Jedi should learn to live with emotions, not suppress them, and like the idea of writing pragmatic Siths who could have control over their emotions. Like the eye of a storm.)<br><br>Notes: Applied volunteerly after hearing about OFUs from former students. Didn&#39;t write a SW fic yet. Is a pretty big fan of Legends continuity, especially the Old Republic time, be it the MMO, Revan or Meetra Surik, and Thrawn. Disdainful about the second animated series of Clone Wars, consider Maul&#39;s return after Phantom Menace as &#39;cheap&#39; and Savage Oppress as a &#39;yellow clone of Maul created to boost audimat&#39;. Still likes Rebels, and saw all the movies and the first Clone Wars series. Like the idea of learning about lightsabers, with a little weak spot for dual wielding. Did some fencing and canne de combat.<br><br><br><br>Name: Darth Destructus (Lewis Jenkin).<br><br>Age: 15<br><br>Description: The most awesome pureblood Sith ever, with black hair and golden eyes, a kickass prothesis replacing his left arm, a total destructive juggernaut of the dark side. (Scrawny brat a little too much enthusiastic with black hair and brown eyes. Acne is still here, ready to come back if stress rises.)<br><br>Lust Object (if applicable): Rey and Assajj Ventress are badass. Period.<br><br>Light Side/Dark Side: Dark side. clearly the more powerful guys. Except whiny Kylo Ren.<br><br>Notes: Did like to write fics with a lot of over-the-top power fantasies as a way to take out frustrations from his life. Did see all the movies, but is far from being at the top of the game about them, and like Clone Wars, the second series. Also an avid player from the MMO the Old Republic. Is pretty much on the side of &#39;evil is cool and badass&#39;. Generally loud andd obnoxious as a way to exist.</p>

            <p>Well technically more like three ideas.  I haven&#39;t been writing and a while and it was irritating me.  So I think I&#39;m going to start writing again, and I always like to start with fanfiction to get the creative juices flowing again.  So I have three works I&#39;m working on.  But I want a bit of a twist.<br><br>I&#39;m calling for a bit of audience participation.  The three stories I&#39;m working on are all based on video games.  Namely Pokemon, Mass Effect, and Dragon Age. So here&#39;s the idea, periodically I would like to poll the audience to basically create a prompt for me to work with.  You can feel free to add your own prompts, but I may not use that in the story.<br><br>For purposes of this experiment, the stories I write will be following the main plot of the games.  Without further ado, the first prompt:<br><br> --------------<br>|Who are you?  | <br> --------------<br><br>Title:  The Fifth Blight-Dragon Age Origins<br>Choices:<br><br>1.  Elissa Cousland.  Eldest Daughter and second child of Teryn Bryce Cousland.  Essentially uses Human Noble Origin, with a few twists thrown in.<br><br>2.  Kallian Tabris.  Daughter of Cyrion and Adaia Tabris.  Female City Elf Origin<br><br>3.  Theron Mahariel.  Dalsih Elf Origin<br><br>4.  Daylen Amell.  Mage Origin.  <br><br>5.  Duran Aeducan.  Dwarf Noble Background.<br><br>Or the three origins I outlined:<br><br>1.  Dame Jeanne de Bayard.  Third Child of a minor Orlesian Noble, she was given to the Chantry as a child and became a member of the Templar Order.  She was transferred to the Ferelden Circle approximately a year before the events of Dragon Age Origins. <br><br>2.  Eddard Hawthorne.  Renegade Apostate Mage.  Captured at 16.  Escaped the Circle of Starkhaven.  Ventured across the Waking Sea.  Has recently taken up residence in a back alley of Denerim.<br><br>3.  Celestina Titus.  Unwelcomed &quot;Representative&quot; of the Imperium.  In-spite of her considerable wealth and prestige she determined to sneak into Ferelden.  Altus or not, she had heard interesting goings on, and she wanted to be part of it.<br><br></p>

            <p>... it appears that the Seventh GoM Player is equal to LOTR&#39;s Tenth Walker.<br><br>In many countries, sports tournaments are divided by biological sexes. There are NBA and WNBA. In Japan, the players are mostly male and females are placed as managers. I do not know if there are women basketball arena in Japan, but let&#39;s assume there is.<br><br>A pattern I see when I browse through Wattpad for KnB fanfics is that a girl is placed as the Seventh GoM and plays alongside Seirin&#39;s main team, alongside the dueterogonists. This is already breaking KnB&#39;s lore, as all the matches we see in Interhigh and Winter Cups are men&#39;s basketball.<br><br>We do see one female basketball player in canon. She is a top athlete in WNBA but retires due to injuries. She found some kids and finds a purpose in life by training the two kids she found. Their relationship to each other is like a shonen version of Scathath-Cu Chulainn-Ferdiad. No Gae Bolg and murders though, thank God.<br><br>All the other women we see in KnB are either coaches or managers. They are strong and useful in their own right. But they don&#39;t play. That is not their duty.<br><br>My point is, if you want to insert a female character into KnB AS AN ATHLETE, insert almost a hundred good female players amongst many schools. You can create your own GoMs amongst the females. Make the males your love interest(s) if you wish, but your main point is to fight for the game. Win or lose, your choice. But fight. You don&#39;t have to make three seasons worth of basketball plays, but make them play. <br><br>You can insert a female character as a manager&#39;s assistant, if you really must have her join the sport alongside the males. It won&#39;t hurt the plot a lot, the manager really does need a lot of help. And don&#39;t get too close to Kise Ryouta, he has a dimension that I think will not be healthy for  a longterm relationship.<br><br>Thank you for reading my rant. I will not be sporking, I have many problems with my own fics.</p>

            <p>Well, I&#39;ve been reading and skulking around the wiki for years, so after reading an awful lot of fanfic that inspired gag-reflexes in me recently, I figured I&#39;d take the time to jump in here and introduce myself.<br><br>I seem to be going by Thoth around the &#39;net of late, so I may as well take the name here, too.

            <p>Hi! I&#39;m Calliope, more frequently abbreviated to Cal. We&#39;re both named after writing people, so yay for that!<br><br>(Then again, I&#39;m also named for a musical instrument, a Homestuck character, and a missile silo. I like meaningful names.)<br><br>Here, have a few Newbie Gifts! You get the standard set of roleplaying dice in whatever color and/or pattern and/or texture you want, plus a calligraphic copy of the Imperial Creed to decorate your Boarder RC (I think we have those, and if not, we do now).<br><br>If you decide to join the Discord, you should join us for Dark Heresy at some point! We need another player, because some of ours had to leave - one for moral reasons, one because life got in the way. All we have now is a Tech-Priest, a Psyker, and a Cleric with a budding reputation for seducing inanimate objects (and the occasional heretic, but those were accidental). Plus, you know, Our Lord GM. But he&#39;s not a player.</p>

The only chapters that might be nicer are The Lamenters.<br><br>And speaking of nice chapters, I just recalled something: NEVER trust TVTropes to get anything about 40k right. No, really. For demonstration, here is part of the entry for &quot;Only Sane Man&quot;:<br><br><blockquote>
<br>The Space Wolves are the closest thing to a Sane Man in the galaxy. Consider: after the first victory on Armageddon, the Inquisition starts rounding up civilians into forced labor camps and shooting down Imperial Guard ships, all in the name of preventing the knowledge of Chaos to spread, the whole thing masterminded by a spectacularly inept Inquisitor. The Space Wolves who had fought alongside these people did not take kindly to their eradication, and used their ships to transport Guardsmen, refusing to respond to Inquisitorial and even Grey Knights fire. The whole thing ended up in a cold war that almost ended in open war with the Wolves, their planet-fortress severely damaged, and a Grey Knights Grand Master dead.<br>
</blockquote>
<br><br>...Wow. What is this red mark on my forehead? Did I just read an article that took actual lore and jumped to insane conclusions with it, or something?<br><br>So yeah. The only good thing you can do with TVTropes&#39; knowledge of 40k is have some fun with your friends who play Dark Angels by insisting that Lion is gay. Yes, they actually claimed that. With no citation.</p>

            <p>Here, since the original Thoth is the god of knowledge and other very scholarly things, have a few journals that totally aren&#39;t Dr. Schabbs&#39;s records of his experiments with making zombies! (I&#39;ve been looking for a place to put these. They were too cool to destroy like I was ordered to.)<br><br>Anyway, hi! I&#39;m Twistey, an uberchaotic neutral lightly-used-bie. I am in tons of fandoms, my main one being Wolfenstein 3D or just iD Software in general. I am obsessed with OC creation and other aspects of fandoms that deal with how friendly the canon is to the fans. This may have something to do with the fact that I also write tons and tons of original fiction along with the fanfic. (No, not fafnic or fnafic. Jeez, I can&#39;t type today.) A lot of my non-PPC fanfiction may end up being crack fic or other stuff that&#39;s not meant to be taken seriously, but I&#39;ll have to see how it ends up.<br><br>What are the ideas you&#39;ve had for agents? I&#39;d like to get a general idea of what you want to do once you&#39;re ready to write them. (You <i>can</i> write them doing non-mission things as pre-agents, from what I&#39;ve seen. I think.) As I said, I love character creation, so I might offer a few pointers with regards to your characters.

            <p>Thanks for the journals. I could use some light reading for when I get back to more scholarly content. SICP is hard on a man :-).<br><br>For agents? Nothing concrete. We&#39;ve considered putting a pre-existing OC into the role (we have many of them)[1], but most of them are Space Marines, which hard: Marines tend to be pretty serious (even when I&#39;m writing them, and I can&#39;t keep a straight tone for 5 minutes), and are kinda tricky to write. I mostly play/write Thousand Sons (with a name like this you could have guessed), so I can get away with more than some - seeing as how any of them may be half-mad already - but it&#39;s still tricky.<br><br>My writing partner (who you&#39;ll likely meet soon enough) suggested the possibility having a team from two different canons, so I&#39;m not even locked to 40k: I have additional considerations to make here. Before coming up with a solid pitch, we&#39;ll probably have to talk more.<br><br>[1]You want to talk about friendly to fanfiction? 40k practically generates OCs and fic: I was honestly a little shocked that the 40k wiki entry said we don&#39;t write fanfic: We do. But then I realized that most of it is a) AARs, and thus debatably fanfic, b) 90% of the stuff gets publication outside the usual avenues, ending up on spacebattles, dakkadakka, bolter and chainsword, or the mighty /tg/ and its corresponding wiki (1d4chan), and c) even then we don&#39;t write as much as some other fandoms.</p>

            <p>Hehe, &quot;light reading&quot;. More like &quot;how to make a zombie reading.&quot; Anyway.<br><br>Interesting note about Warhammer 40k being really fanfic-friendly. (Yeah, I looked it up to make sure that that was what you were talking about - I&#39;ve heard of the game before via its section on fantasynamegenerators.com.) That&#39;s kind of sad that your fandom doesn&#39;t get much recognition even from its own wiki. Maybe you should bring someone&#39;s attention to the fanfic, like someone who can bring further attention to it. *Almost says something speculative about the amount of badfic in 40k, but decides against it because the optimistic statement would give the Ironic Overpower something to do.*<br><br>About your agent ideas, maybe you should put one of each into one of your teams, so that the clash of one really uber-serious person and one person of debatable sanity will result in an endless fountain of comedy. The team from two different canons thing also sounds like a good idea, given how characters from different canons would be used to different things. The best agent teams are agents who work well together, but still manage to generate comedy through their differences. That&#39;s part of why PPC fic is fun to read. :)<br><br>-Twistey</p>

            <p>Yep, that was along the lines I was thinking.<br><br>Oh, and I wasn&#39;t talking about OUR wiki, I was talking about the PPC wiki. Which, I must say, provides one of the best introductions I&#39;ve seen to the vast, expansive, insane, REALLY REALLY BIG canon of 40k, despite it having no missions I&#39;ve seen, and only a few Agents originating from the continuum. So some applause is in order for that.<br><br>And the 40k badfic? Yeah. I&#39;ve seen some of it. It doesn&#39;t help that in 40k, &quot;non-canon&quot; is technically not an objective term, and that canon can shift out from under you. However, that&#39;s no excuse for not doing your research, overturning things commonly accepted as canon/fanon, or for being wrong about something that&#39;s been the same for 30 years.<br><br>One of the nice things about 40k is that it&#39;s got a nice corner of canon to place the really disturbing... adult fics, with a canon faction that explicitly has all your disturbing... interests (not sure I can say that word here). Which just makes it more annoying when badfic writers proceed to then write adult fic about factions which are canonically not interested, and also alter their biology to make it work instead.<br><br>Sorry. I just read something truly eye-bleedingly bad, which might be affecting this.<br><br>Anyways, if you want some 40k GOODFIC, (it seemed to be implied) then that I can do:<br><br>Avoiding Stupid Deaths in the 41st Millenium [Rated T]<br>(<a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/11122882/1/Avoiding-Stupid-Deaths-in-the-41st-Millennium"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/11122882/1/Avoiding-Stupid-Deaths-in-the-41st-Millennium">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/11122882/1/Avoiding-Stupid-Deaths-in-the-41st-Millennium</a></a>): Yet another variant on Skippy&#39;s list (initially), it&#39;s a fascinating insight into the life of a guardsman, and progressively grows its own continuity, and even a story arc.

A couple of fics have done it, but this is the only one that matters, because it is so good the others fade into irrelevance. It is funny, touching, and highly entertaining, evolving from madcap comedy to something that feels - atmosphere-wise, anyways - a lot like Animorphs.<br><br>Warhammer High <a href="http://localhost:3000/posts/scrape/2017/a%20href=%22https://www.1d4chan.org/wiki/Warhammer_High%22%3Ehttps://www.1d4chan.org/wiki/Warhammer_High%3C/a">T-NSFW, but the site&#39;s NSFW as a whole</a>: WHH is not the obligatory Highschool AU (THAT would be HS40k). It&#39;s actually something far stranger.<br><br>WHH takes place in an AU where the Emperor was a bit more careful - and probably nicer, and smarter - the Horus Heresy never happened, and the Crusade ended. He gave the Primarchs devices which would allow them to conceive - with a wife, of course - daughters. Who then go to Highschool together.<br><br>Yeah, I know, it sounds weird at best, awful at worst, and since it&#39;s a shared universe, some of the fics are (and there&#39;s at least one Mary Sue, in theory, but AFAICT he&#39;s never been written about). However, it&#39;s actually shockingly good, due in no small part to the work of the writer Someone Else, whose stories in the setting are the ones I would recommend the most. For introductions, I suggest his adorable and rather sappy fic &quot;Venus&#39;s Burn&quot; <a href="http://localhost:3000/posts/scrape/2017/a%20href=%22https://www.1d4chan.org/wiki/Venus%27_Burn%22%3Ehttps://www.1d4chan.org/wiki/Venus%27_Burn%3C/a">NSFW</a> which convinced me that this wasn&#39;t an awful idea.<br><br>Confessions of a Wayward Son <a href="http://localhost:3000/posts/scrape/2017/a%20href=%22https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6226554/1/Confessions-of-a-Wayward-Son%22%3Ehttps://www.fanfiction.net/s/6226554/1/Confessions-of-a-Wayward-Son%3C/a">T</a>: I&#39;m not sure about putting this one one here, and it&#39;s not without it&#39;s problems. Also, I love the Thousand Sons. Like I said, I&#39;m a sucker for moral ambiguity, and the Sons can do that pretty well when they want to. It helps that they&#39;ve got (IMHO) one of the best villains in the setting. So I may be slightly biased towards this fic. Decide if it&#39;s any good for yourself.<br><br>Anyways, one semi-common (from what I&#39;ve seen) fanfic premise is the idea of the Chaos Space Marine who goes rogue. Think Drizzt as your frame of reference, but less speshul (hopefully). This is, I think, a pretty good execution of that concept. For one thing, this premise makes a good deal more sense for the Sons than for just about any other Chaos Legion. Besides, being transported to an evil world of horror and corruption and then later seeing all of your friends turned into mindless robots by accident might make you rethink your allegiances. So our protagonist goes rogue and sets out to fight the forces of Chaos on his own. And things get kind of interesting. Then the fic abruptly ends because the author vanished into thin air.<br><br>If The Emperor Had A Text-To-Speech Device <a href="http://localhost:3000/posts/scrape/2017/a%20href=%22http://www.youtube.com/user/alfabusa%22%3Ehttp://www.youtube.com/user/alfabusa%3C/a">T - extreme profanity</a>: Does it count as a fanfic if it&#39;s video? Whatever, I couldn&#39;t leave this one out.<br><br>What began as a one-off video rather acerbically going after some of the... less liked elements of 40k canon (at least, during the &quot;glory days&quot; of 5th and early 6th edition: things have improved somewhat since then) ended up being a lot more. TTS as it stands has a solid cast recurring characters, an actual plot and story arc, and is funnier than ever. Yeah, 40k&#39;s comedies tend to get hit by Cerebus a lot. It has an expanded universe with even more stuff, there&#39;s an IC podcast now... Look, just go watch it: it&#39;s a big part of how and why I got into 40k, and it&#39;s just really funny.<br><br>Sadly, the playlist is missing some of the newer episodes (namely, Special #4, where Kitten plays The God of Fate at Yu-Gi-Oh! - no, I&#39;m not joking, yes, this IS plot-relevant), so you may just have to scroll down the video feed for them.<br><br>That&#39;s probably enough for now.</p>

<li>I could also get you a Very Flat Flamethrower(TM) if you wish. Just as an extra gift because you seem so interested in the first gift.<br><br>2. Oh, that&#39;s cool. Do you have a Wikia account? Maybe you should edit the page a bit to correctly show the amount of fanfic in the fandom...<br><br>3. Yeah... very true. *almost says something speculative about the badness of said badfic, but decides not to because the hopeful statement would give the Ironic Overpower something to do.*<br><br>4. I almost spoke too soon. OH MEIN LIEBEN! Come on! Canon gave the idiots a specific place to put their NSFW stuff AND THEY JUST USE EVERYWHERE ELSE?! Sounds like something a stubborn pet would do, like they take a bathroom break everywhere <i>but</i> the litterbox! Man, that&#39;s stupid.<br><br>5. I&#39;ll check that out soon, maybe after I learn some stuff about Warhammer 40k... X&#39;D It sounds cool, though! I&#39;ve got a friend who&#39;s pretty much made me sick of Pathfinder (dunno about D&amp;D, though - I consider it better) and never want to play it again, so Warhammer 40k would be a good tabletop role-playing game for me, since it&#39;s nowhere near Pathfinder&#39;s genre.<br><br>-Twistey<br>----<br>&quot;Very Flat Flamethrower(TM)? What even...?&quot;<br>Glad you asked!<br><a href="http://wolfenstein.wikia.com/wiki/Fake_Hitler"><a href="http://wolfenstein.wikia.com/wiki/Fake_Hitler">http://wolfenstein.wikia.com/wiki/Fake_Hitler</a></a><br>Those things are said to have a flamethrower in their chest to mimic fire powers... how could you fit a flamethrower inside the torso of a wooden puppet the size and shape of a human? The fandom&#39;s only answer was the Very Flat Flamethrower(TM). (I don&#39;t have any in stock currently, so I&#39;d pretty much have to go back to the bunker and face the risk of burning to death to kill one of those things and wrench the flamethrower out. Yeah.)</li>

            <p>You needn&#39;t risk your life for that. Besides, the OC wot took my name (started as a barebones character I made for RP reasons, kinda took on a life of his own) CAN shoot fire out of his hands, so maybe I inherited the ability in reverse. I mean, what have I got to lose? Save my life, sanity, freedom, and immortal soul, of course...<br><br>As for wanting to pick of 40k, I CAN give you some advice regarding how to do so.<br><br>First off, do you want to play the RPGs, or the wargame? If you want to play the (bloody fantastic) RPGs, I can suggest that you pirate them with no moral regrets: the books are out of print, and they&#39;re likely never coming back. They all run similar or identical systems: I suggest Dark Heresy (the CoC/Spanish Inquisition/whatever one where you play normal humans trying to stop the cults of the Dark Gods^H^H^H^HBits of Emotion With an Inflated Sense of Self-Worth), or Rogue Trader (Screw over Xenos and sell things for profit! It&#39;s like the 1700s. IN SPACE), but the more fighty RPGs like Only War (Guardsman Simulator! Remember, you are replaceable and will not be missed), Deathwatch (Purge the Xenos! Burn the Heretic! Destroy the Enemies of Mankind! Play super-soldiers that GW still won&#39;t admit that they initially rippied off from Robert Heinlein!), and Black Crusade (BE the evil corrupted Chaos Worshippers you&#39;ve been fighting!) are also very good.<br><br>If you want to play the WARGAME, then you&#39;ll need a lot more cash. If you recall, Magic: the Gathering has the nickname &quot;cardboard crack&quot;, both for its price and for its addictiveness. 40k is worse. Games Workshop gouges its customers for money. I do have some tips, though:<br><br>1: Proxies are your friend: In a friendly game, you needn&#39;t own all the models in your army. Something with the same approximate height and base size will do.<br><br>2: Collect slow: pick an army, don&#39;t turn back: Don&#39;t agonize over what army to pick. Just pick one whose lore grabs your interest, and stick with it. If you don&#39;t want to blow the bank, it will be a while before you&#39;ve got a big army, and even longer if you split the effort between forces. But remember you only need a few units to have a good fight with a friend.<br><br>3: On Citadel Supplies: The paints are expensive, but worth it if you can afford them. DO NOT BUY ANY OTHER CITADEL SUPPLIES. Even the paint&#39;s optional: you want (although you don&#39;t NEED) model paint, but Vallejo, Coat d&#39;Arms (online only), ArmyPainter, Reaper, and others will provide comparable or better products in similar colors. See what your local shops sell.<br><br>4: Games to play with few models: There are Skirmish games that use the same models as 40k: Killteam: Heralds of Ruin (free from it&#39;s site if you&#39;ve got the now-outdated 7e rules, but an 8e update is in the works) and GW&#39;s own Shadow War: Armageddon are both fantistic, and rather cheaper to play than 40k proper. I&#39;d even argue that SWA might be a bit more fun. However, both use Templates and Scatter Dice (special equipment which 8th edition jettisoned). Templates can be printed or replicated with a ruler, but Scatter dice actually must be bought. I got mine for less than a dollar from a Games Workshop store.<br><br>5: Just... Don&#39;t: The real appeal of 40k is its setting and world. IMHO, it is FAR from the best wargame out there. Hell, because of SWA (and Necromunda!), I&#39;d say it&#39;s not even the best wargame in its own setting anymore. It&#39;s gotten a lot better (well 8e screwed psykers, but in ALL other respects...), but there are better games you can play. SWA is better, the soon-to-return Adeptus Titanicus is better (heck, we might even get Epic back). It&#39;s not a bad game, and you may like it more than I do (I DO like it, but it is too expensive to get a strong reccomendation from me), but if you want to pick up a wargame to play, right now, I&#39;d tell you to pick up either SWA or BattleTech Alpha Strike (<i>or</i> BattleTech proper, depending on your complexity tolerance). Both games are cheaper, have cheaper models (BT may not even require you to BUY models), and both are IMHO a lot more fun than 40k. But that&#39;s just me...<br><br>As to getting into 40k lore... Well, that&#39;s a lot easier and cheaper. You COULD spend $50 dollars on a Codex - a book of game rules and lore - for a faction you may never play (7th edition 40k Core not only suggested that you do this, but <i>claimed it was common practice</i>. I was ready to choke the author), or you could do what most people do and read the wikis.<br><br>First, a preface: 40k lore is a mess. A glorious mess, but a mess all the same. Some of it is self-contradictory. GW&#39;s stance is that &quot;everything is canon, but canon doesn&#39;t mean TRUE,&quot; so some stuff might be propaganda, misinformation, or flat out lies. Like everything that comes out of C.S. Goto&#39;s mouth, but that&#39;s another story. So no source is entirely authoritative, nor is it possible to be so.<br><br>Having said that, there are three primary wikis for 40k:<br><br>-<a href="http://www.lexicanum.com"> Lexicanum</a>: If you want the facts, Lexicanum will give them to you. It may not have all the detail in the world, but if there&#39;s a thing that&#39;s been mentioned somewhere in the 40k universe, then Lexicanum&#39;s probably got an article about it.<br><br>-The Warhammer 40k Wikia: I don&#39;t have to link this one, I think. The difference between Lexicanum and the Wikia is that the Lexicanum is wide, the Wikia is deep: It may not have an article on what you&#39;re looking for, but if it does, it will probably go more in-detail about it than Lexicanum does. I believe it may also cover game mechanics and such, but I&#39;m not sure.<br><br>-<a href="https://1d4chan.org">1d4chan</a> [NSFW]: 1d4chan isn&#39;t a 40k wiki. But it is an important part of the culture of at least one portion of the 40k fandom.<br><br>1d4chan is the official wiki of 4chan&#39;s /tg/ board - which I heartily recommend visiting if you are to sort who likes that sort of thing (that is, tabletop games and 4chan) - and what a wiki it is. /tg/ is very 40k focused, so it&#39;s got articles about all the big stuff in 40k (and some of the not-so-big stuff). However, it makes no pretense of being unbiased, providing insight into both the universe and its fans. It is also home to a wide variety of excellent AARs (after action reports - like Fanfic, but they (possibly) really happened at someone&#39;s gaming table) and fanfic. Love Can Bloom, the previously mentioned Warhammer High, Love and Krieg, Gav and Bob, Half Life 40k, Orkhammer, and other classic or otherwise fics call this place home, as do classic and much loved bits of fanon, most famously the Angry Marines (ALWAYS ANGRY! ALL THE TIME!)<br><br>In addition, if you&#39;re a roleplayer outside of 40k, it holds some fics and  that are well and truly legendary, and others that should be. I could write a list, but the big one, the almighty legend of roleplaying, is Old Man Henderson. If you don&#39;t know Old Man Henderson, go read it. Now. I am dead serious.<br><br>But I digress. Just read around what interests you. Then go watch &quot;If the Emperor had a Text-To-Speech Device&quot; once you&#39;ve got the basics down. Hey, it worked for me.<br><br>The other big way to attain information about 40k lore is through the books. The output of the Black Library is of varying quality: Some books and authors are universally loved, others are hated so much that the fandom - and even other BL authors - essentially consider their works non-canon (most infamously, C.S. Goto). Due to the canon policy stated above, this can actually happen. Here are some notable authors, and also some authors I know stuff about:<br><br>-Dan Abnett: Wrote Gaunt&#39;s Ghosts (Sharpe in 40k) among many other things. Is usually considered to be one of, if not <i>the</i> best writer Black Library&#39;s got, or ever had. I&#39;ve really got to read this guy.<br><br>-Graham McNeil: The second of BL&#39;s largely-undisputed Holy Trinity. He also wrote a lot of stuff. Most important to me is that he wrote &quot;A Thousand Sons,&quot; &quot;The Crimson King,&quot; and most of other lore and background that defined my Legion&#39;s character from that point onward. His work tends to be more thoughtful: less action, more dialogue. Heck, one of his most well-known short stories, &quot;The Last Church,&quot; is mostly just two characters talking. And talking religion and philosophy at that.<br><br>-Sandy Mitchell: The third (and sadly gone - he left BL) member of The Trinity. Sandy Mitchell is the author of Ciaphas Cain series, which is a blackly comedic series about a the famous commissar- just go read it already. It&#39;s good.<br><br>-Aaron Dembski-Bowden: The first more controversial writer on our list. On one hand, his Night Lords books were very well-received, and he apparently had some responsibility for making the Grey Knights less Sue-ish (not that he could have made them MORE Sue-ish). OTOH, he wrote &quot;Master of Mankind.&quot; Which just by its plot summary and quotes makes me and many others think he&#39;s been writing Chaos for so long that he&#39;s forgotten who the Emperor IS. Many fans consider it noncanon, or at least untrue, as is their right. In 40K, canon works the way YOU do XD (to an extent).<br><br>-John French: Some Iron Warriors fans hate this guy. Thousand Sons fans (me) and others? not so much (seriously, if you read his 1d4 page, you can tell which bits were written by IW fans). Although his IW books do sound kinda dumb. Right now I&#39;m reading his Ahriman Trilogy. The man literally had me at the introduction - as he described his ideas and intents, it was made clear that he understood what the character was about, and he know what he wanted to do with him. Thus far, the book&#39;s been pretty good. Then again, he had excellent material to work with: IMHO, Ahriman is one of the most compelling villains, if not one of the most compelling <i>characters</i> in 40k.<br><br>So there we go. Absurdly long, I know. Hope it helps!</p>

            <p>Okay then, fair enough. If you&#39;ve already got fire powers, the VFF is just kind of a collector&#39;s item and hazard.<br><br>0. Alllllllllrighty. I&#39;ll have to see which one I think I want.<br><br>1. Okay then. Smart idea.<br>2. Okay then. Makes sense.<br>3. Alrighty. Don&#39;t get anything but the paints or stuff by other brands.

Okay then. Maybe I&#39;ll just read the wikis and maybe get some friends into it and be kind of a moderator/GM type or some&#39;n. Do you have those?<br>7. Hokay then. I&#39;ll try checking out all of them (as long as my computer doesn&#39;t block 1d4chan like a derp.) It&#39;s good to have a balance between one wide wiki and one deep wiki, and a look into the fandom.<br><br>8. Ooh. I like it when a game where things are centered around characters made by the players also puts out little pieces of lore for people to enjoy. (Which is kind of contradictory... hmm, maybe I should actually watch somebody playing Minecraft: Story Mode before I go rapid fire on it again. Actually, nah. It&#39;s stupid. Wither Storm? Order of the Stone? Seriously?! That&#39;s not a thing! And Minecraft is one of those games where it&#39;s too open for a story mode to even be good ever... oh right, I need to read the rest of Thoth&#39;s post about 40k. Whoops.)<br><br>9. Okay then. I&#39;ll know who to look for and what to watch out for. (Although once I&#39;m done with reading the good stuff and getting a good grip of canon, I&#39;ll have to read CS Goto&#39;s stuff so I can laugh my socks off like I do with bad fanfic.)<br><br>Thanks for the advice!

            <p>I realized I should probably explain this further...<br><br>As a general rule (of what is accepted within the fandom, in my experience), you are not allowed to replace canon with your awful fanon, just because &quot;everything is canon but not necessarily true.&quot; No, the Siege on Terra didn&#39;t get routed by the Angry Marines, don&#39;t write fanfic about the Angry Marines period, who let you in here?<br><br>It is also considered unacceptable to just outright deny any major historical event or bit of characterization: The Council of Nikea, the Drop Site Massacre, the destruction of the Interex, and so on, did happen. The Dark Angels and the Space Wolves DO have a rivalry, and if you&#39;re writing in M42, the events of Dark Imperium happened, whether you want them to or not.<br><br>What IS acceptable is discard newer radical shifts in characterization, retcons, and so on. Which is why to this day you&#39;ll see fics where the Necrons are killer robot automatons, and as far as I know nobody save Aaron Dembski-Bowden ever characterizes the Emperor as a cold, emotionless, Lex-Luthor type character who doesn&#39;t care about anyone.<br><br>In addition, it is okay - basically mandatory - to discard obvious propaganda, particularly most things about the strength of characters: yes, Space Marines are more powerful in canon then on the table, but each Space Marine is not equivalent to 2000 Guardsmen: That&#39;s insane.<br><br>Once again, hope this helps.</p>

            <p>Did you remember that Amazon is doing a six-part/six-hour miniseries of <i>Good Omens</i>, with scripts written by Neil Gaiman? No? Well, they are and you should. And apparently, the series is being co-produced by both the BBC (who already did a brilliant Radio adaptation which <a href="http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x3ds4ux">I can&#39;t possibly recommend you find on DailyMotion</a>), and Narrativia, Rhianna Pratchett&#39;s production company. This is pretty much the perfect storm of &#39;involvement by the right people&#39;, and if it goes wrong I will be very frownyface.<br><br>The first <a href="http://variety.com/2017/tv/news/neil-gaiman-good-omens-michael-sheen-amazon-1202522663/">casting news</a> has been announced, and we have our two angelic beings: Michael Sheen is playing Aziraphale, with - wait for it - David Tennant as Crowley.<br><br>Naturally, at this point, there was only one place my mind went. ...no, not there. ...no, not there either. ... come on, are you even trying?

            <p>If your library has ebooks as well as print (possibly via OverDrive) and you don&#39;t mind reading a book on a screen, that&#39;s a great way to take out the book without finding time to go in. Assuming your library has a website, it shouldn&#39;t be too hard to find. My library has, among other things, ebook/audiobook access, which is especially amazing if you&#39;re traveling--so long as my card is active, I can take out online media from pretty much anywhere I have an internet connection. You also don&#39;t need an ereader to read what you take out: there&#39;s an app (if it&#39;s OverDrive, which does seem to be in America as well as Canada), and you can also just read in your internet browser. So if you think that&#39;s for you, I recommend checking to see if your library has the option and then if they have the book to begin with.<br><br>Alternatively, you can put the book on hold and then only have to find time to go to the library to pick it up. While libraries are awesome places and I certainly recommend spending time in them, (they can even be good places to do homework!) if your time is very limited (or feels very limited), that&#39;s a way around it. Holds can also, in my experience, be picked up by someone else so long as they have your card with them, so if you&#39;ve got a family member who&#39;s going anyway (or is out for other things and doesn&#39;t mind another stop), you could ask them to pick up a hold.<br><br>And, of course, you can check your school library! Even if they don&#39;t have it, they may get it if you show up with interest in reading it...and school librarians are usually great people to know, so it&#39;s win-win :)<br><br>Really, though, don&#39;t feel pressured. Give school attention if it needs it, try to find a balance between academic life and personal life (believe me, you *need* that, unless all your hobbies are super academic and you have no trouble fitting in some time for friends/family/yourself already), and, well, good luck getting used to the new level of school. It&#39;ll happen.<br><br>And now I&#39;m going to finish waking up and wonder when I started giving unsolicited student life advice within ten minutes of getting out of bed...which is not to say I think it&#39;s bad advice; I&#39;m just a little surprised I ended up giving it while still yawning. Oh well. Hope it&#39;s useful, or at least not unhelpful?<br><br>~Z *wanders off chuckling about &quot;Huinesoron smash&quot;, because really, that sounds funny and possibly something for his agent counterpart in the badfic games*</p>

            <p>I really enjoyed Serafinowicz as Crowley. I can&#39;t really say &#39;I&#39;m surprised they didn&#39;t keep him&#39;, since this is a completely different company, but it would&#39;ve been nice. Kaitlyn has repeatedly said it would also be nice to see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colin_Morgan">the kid from Merlin</a> stick around as Newt, too; he certainly has the perfect face for the role.<br><br>I find it amusing that our two angelic beings are both non-English Britons - AziraSheen is Welsh, while can&#39;t-portmanteau-Crowley-and-Tennant is obviously Scottish. An internet did observe that it&#39;s very conservative casting - Tennant is super famous, and of course they&#39;re both white (and male - angels are sexless, of course!). Which may be a valid point, but on the other hand, we have no idea what the rest of the cast is going to look like. You can&#39;t even say they&#39;ve relegated diversity to the secondary characters, because (at minimum) Adam, Newt, and Anathema are all leads. In a movie, they couldn&#39;t be, but... six hours!<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>From the depths, it rises!<br><br>...or, you know. From out of my suddenly very busy life (school. Just...school) comes an interlude I wrote back in March and rediscovered recently.

            <p>Short and sweet and sad, at the same time.  It&#39;s an interesting thing to think about, for the agents who are clones of canon characters: potentially seeing the decisions made by their alternates, and the consequences thereof, and wondering if they would have made the same decisions in that situation.  Tricky thing to think about.<br><br>Minor thing, but I like the different activities you show the kids doing in the Nursery.  Even though the &quot;camera&quot; only shows them, it still lends itself to a picture of a larger, chaotically active room full of kids.<br><br>—doctorlit has an interlude in draft form that finally describes the physical layout of the Nursery, really needs to get that into beta-worthy shape</p>

            <p>It&#39;s been a while, hasn&#39;t it?

Evil Batman-themed AU Justice League? Inexplicable giant robot? The return of old, vanished characters, including one coming over from one of the best comic series of all time? Yes plz.<br><br>(Note that I do not actually read comics on publication, but someday this will make it into the library system, and I shall claim it.)<br><br><b>Silly News</b><br><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSKesHpck08"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/kQXBAmE.png"></a><br>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSKesHpck08">Link</a>)<br><br>Back in 2014, a coronal mass ejection left the sun and swept across the solar system. By sheer fluke, its path took it across not just one, but <i>ten</i> of our spaceships - everything from the Curiousity rover to Voyager 2, right out on the edge (it took a year and a half to get that far!). And, in the biggest accidental experiment of all time, all of those probes were able to detect the speed and density of the CME, giving us a clear look at its entire lifespan. <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2017JA023884/epdf">The article was published this week</a>.<br><br><b>Serious News</b><br><br>I&#39;m not going to put up a picture for this.<br>(<a href="http://splinternews.com/it-was-never-going-to-be-a-normal-protest-they-came-re-1797824445">Link</a>)<br><br>A week ago, a large crowd of neo-Nazis and their supporters gathered in Charlottesville, Virginia for a rally in support of racism, prejudice, and, ultimately, genocide. They brought guns. They brought Confederate flags, symbols of a nation which died in its attempts to maintain slavery as an institution. They brought Hitler salutes, Nazi chants, and they brought a man who was happy to ram his car into a crowd of counter-protesters, killing one.<br><br>Afterward, the President of the United States made it clear that he found both sides - the neo-Nazis and the counter-protesters - responsible for the violence that ensued. I can see the logic behind that, in that the counter-protesters also came armed (though not with guns), and according to the linked article, started the violence at some points. And, y&#39;know what, I&#39;m personally inclined against the idea that starting a fight with neo-Nazis is the best way to deal with them, though again, I can understand why other people think differently. But let me be entirely clear: the counter-protesters were precisely as responsible and culpable for the violence in Charlottesville as the Allies were on the beaches of Normandy in 1944. <br><br><b>Not News</b><br><br><a href="http://www.sullla.com/Civ4/civ4survivor3.html"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/NM6FsDX.png"></a><br>(<a href="http://www.sullla.com/Civ4/civ4survivor3.html">Link</a>)<br><br>If you&#39;re a fan of the Civilisation games, specifically Civ 4, then you might be interested in the third season of Civ 4 AI Survivor, a livestreamed/written-up-afterwards tournament with every AI in the game fighting it out for the crown of Best AI. I can&#39;t speak for his livestreams, but Sullla&#39;s written reports are an absolute delight to read.

            <p>How old is this show turning, anyway? I remember when it first came out, but can&#39;t place the year. My guess is somewhere around 2010, though, given that Ashley Tisdale&#39;s in it and I was mildly excited when I found that out.<br><br>...man. 2007-2015 (sayeth IMDb).

            <p>Hello everyone, and welcome to the PPC scavenger hunt! This is a new game, where boarders look for various uncommon to extremely rare things in fanfic (mostly badfic) and then get points for finding them. Whoever has the most points at the end wins.<br><br>I have a list of 50 items that you will be able to find and get points for. When the hunt starts, I&#39;ll post a thread on the T-Board. To get points for an item, reply to that thread with a quote or the part of the fic containing the item and a link to the chapter of the fic where the quote is from. You can&#39;t use the exact same thing as another boarder, but using something else from the same sentence for the same item on the list. <br><br>Also, to keep the scavenger hunt safe for people verifying finds, NSFW or NSFB fics are not allowed. To keep things interesting, any items must be found in chapters that were published at most one month before the scavenger hunt begins, and anything from any fic that has been PPC&#39;ed is not allowed. I&#39;m intending for the game to run for a month to allow people to participate at a fairly leisurely rate.<br><br>I&#39;m not eligible to compete because I made the list, but if you&#39;re interested, just reply. If there&#39;s enough interest, I&#39;ll start the game sometime next week.</p>

            <p>Yeah, uh, that fic absolutely deserves to exist, and you should write it now . . . Guess it&#39;s enough that we&#39;ll be getting cyberpunk!Boromir in HQ.  (Or rather, that we <i>have had</i> him since 2003!)  I do totally want him to talk about his home universe once in a while, just so we can hear more of the translations from Tolkien stuff to cyberstuff.<br><br>Also, out of curiosity, do Allaire and Kitkat still exist?  I had totally forgotten about them up until seeing them mentioned on the wiki just now, and they were part of the recruitment process in the original story, so . . . ?<br><br>—doctorlit, wondering</p>

You may need them in case you are running from a Mary Sue and you need to hide from her behind a pushwall while the canons and I take care of her.<br><br>Anyway, a few things about me: as you can see, I am very into Wolfenstein 3D and retro gaming in general, and I take some guilty pleasure in driving certain oldbies insane. ;P I am in a ton of fandoms, given how easily I can be dragged into them, and I am obsessed with character creation and how much or how little a continuum supports OCs. (Funny how sometimes the continuums with the least OC support have the most OCs. Five Nights at Freddy&#39;s, anyone?)<br><br>What about you? Aside from those three you mentioned below, what fandoms are you in? What do you like about writing? What do you like about fanfic? How did you find us? I&#39;d love to hear your reply!<br><br>Nice to meet you!<br><br>-Twistey<br><br>---<br>&quot;Wait, could I find these maps in an actual form?&quot;<br>Yep! They&#39;re all contained on this page:<br><a href="http://wolfenstein.wikia.com/wiki/Escape_from_Wolfenstein#Levels"><a href="http://wolfenstein.wikia.com/wiki/Escape_from_Wolfenstein#Levels">http://wolfenstein.wikia.com/wiki/Escape_from_Wolfenstein#Levels</a></a></p>

            <p>Here, have a replica of Rule Breaker. It&#39;s not a very sharpd knife, but the original is a very useful tool for high-level maguc. You will have to consult the Nasuverse for further explanations. But this replica isn;t rule-breaking, nor can it break rules. Except for fashion, perhaps.<br><br>Are you into any fandoms, other than Super Sentai? And is that a genre classification or something?</p>

            <p>Hi! Welcome to the board. I have also read some of the legendary badfic. Although reading My Immortal was a horrible experience, one of the dramatic readings of it on youtube made it quite funny to listen to. For your newbie gift, have a replica of Curtana, it&#39;s not sharp enough to cut through dimensions, but can still cut normal stuff.</p>
