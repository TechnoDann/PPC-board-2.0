            <p>Congratulations! You have been selected by a nonspecific omnipotent entity to be pulled from the real world and flung headfirst into a land of fiction. My name is Huinesoron, and I will be your Mysterious Voice from Above for today. I&#39;m here to guide you through your first steps in your new home - oh, bee tee dubs, you&#39;re never getting back - and hopefully keep you alive. Fingers crossed!<br><br>First things first: while you were falling through the swirling mists of the Void, your nonspecific omnipotent entity should have whispered the name of the world you&#39;re heading for into your ear. So before we go any further:<br><br><b>Where are you going?<br>-Middle-earth<br>-The Discworld<br>-A galaxy far, far away</b><br><br><hr>
<br><br>This is a game that cuts somewhere between roleplay, fiction, and Fun With Canons. It shares some similarities with Iximaz&#39;s <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=302452">You wake up in a forest</a>, though I was thinking about it before that thread. You - as the collective responder - will answer a series of questions from your Mysterious Voice from Above, and the answers you give will determine where you are (and how that goes for you).<br><br>For this first question, I need you to pick one of the three options. Every other question will also be multiple-choice, but you can also come up with your own answer. You should also feel free to elaborate on your answers as much as you want - the goal is for people who <i>don&#39;t</i> know the canon to be able to answer by picking one of the options, while people who <i>do</i> know it can make their own or elaborate on one of the choices.<br><br>I&#39;ll also keep track of what we&#39;ve discussed so far, so people can jump straight in without having to read the whole thread. Try to keep it to a single chain, though.<br><br>Oh, and feel free - after this first question - to give answers that <i>don&#39;t</i> directly answer. Your Mysterious Voice might get a bit Cli- uh, snippy with you, but hey, you&#39;ve just fallen into a canon world, we have to make allowances.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Would it be acceptable for me to set up shop as Mysterious Voice Mark Two? I adore the concept, and it&#39;s left me brimful of inspiration for ways I could chaperone a player through Leigh Bardugo&#39;s Grishaverse or a Shakespeare mish-mash (oh, Shakespeare isn&#39;t a fandom? I and my lovingly-crafted slashfic beg to differ). But I also feel like it would be rude to muscle in on your great idea. . . or at least, I&#39;m worried that if we start adding even more subthreads we might clutter up the Board. <br><br>Thoughts? May I go ahead? Should I leave it to the creator and master?

            <p>I have no problem with someone(s) else taking the idea and running with it, though it might be sensible to wait a while before doing so. Three caveats, however:<br><br>1/ Please make it canons most people have a passing familiarity with. Giving people the choice of your three favourite obscure fandoms will make for a very quiet thread and/or most people in it not knowing what you&#39;re on about.<br><br>2/ It would be... pretty spectacularly rude to take my idea and play it on the Discord channel, where I don&#39;t go. Obviously I can&#39;t stop anyone, but, yeah, that would suck for me.<br><br>3/ This is actually really draining (though fun!), especially if you let multiple chains run at once. Look at how many posts I&#39;ve made in the last week, hopping between five different storylines. Just... don&#39;t bite off more than you can chew. Make sure you can finish what you start.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>You gather up a ragtag group of Force ghosts - handless Mace Windu, invisible Qui-Gon, the less-bad Sith Darth Vectivus, and a handful of backing singers. Your motley band fails to take Mos Eisley by storm initially, mostly because the only people who can see you are old Ben Kenobi, some kid called Luke, and the specter of Sharad Hett.<br><br>A visit to Mrlsst and a chat with the dead Jedi Taj Junak heralds a change in your fortunes, as you learn to let yourself be seen by anyone. You take a leaf out of the Mrlssi playbook and pretend to be a hologram, and your &#39;original&#39; music - actually an eclectic blend of rock, country, rap, and folk, but how are the locals to know that? - takes the spaceport by storm.<br><br>The galaxy&#39;s renaissance is a thrilling time to be, if not alive, at least still active. Maybe someday you&#39;ll have to take your leave, heading on into the Force (though Vectivus says you can come hang out in his asteroid, where he&#39;s lingered for centuries), but for now, you have your music, you have your art, you have your band.<br><br>And, every so often, you have your field trip to Coruscant to meddle with Vader some more.

            <p>You set out from Lindon on a fine spring evening, with the sun at your back and a fair wind behind you, and you never look back. You feel you&#39;ve chosen the best path in life - why settle for one of the lands of Arda when you can have them all?<br><br>As the years pass, you touch the world only lightly. You watch the cities of Gondor and Arnor grow from afar. You learn the languages of Men, Elves, and Dwarves. You visit with Fangorn the Onod in his last forested refuge. You explore the near regions of Harad, slipping into the Black Numenorean haven at Umbar on little more than a whim. After the Battle of Dagorlad and the fall of Sauron, you even visit Mordor itself, and stand amid the ruins of the Barad-dur.<br><br>Along the way, your Mysterious Voice from Above checks in every so often, keeping you safe, guiding you towards wonders large and small. You are the first person to set foot on the Hill that will one day be the heart of Hobbiton, the first to raise a torch in the caves of Aglarond and see a thousand gems gleam, the first to see the leaves turn gold in autumn and to see them bud again in spring.<br><br>You make no impact on the world. Your knowledge of the future is lost to the ages, and Middle-earth carries on as it was always going to. But you don&#39;t care. For a brief, glittering moment, a mere handful of years, the world is spread out before you, waiting for you to come to it.<br><br>You couldn&#39;t ask for anything more.</p>

            <p><b>Currently: planning to become an Imperial rockstar or something.</b><br><br>You&#39;ve chosen a middle-ground life: not one of active rebellion against the Empire, but not directly supporting its regime of terror either. It&#39;s the life almost everyone on Coruscant will want to live, honestly.<br><br>The key to your success is going to be leveraging your knowledge of the future. Very soon, the Republic is going to become an Empire, and that means that anyone who was <i>already</i> espousing Imperial ideas is going to rise in fame pretty quickly. Here are some options for your rise to social glory:<br><br>-The arts. Take minor roles in holodramas which convey a message of &#39;strength is what we need&#39;, and try to move up to larger roles before the Empire is declared. Or make music, if that&#39;s your thing, proclaiming the villainy of the Jedi and the marvels of Chancellor Palpatine. Paint, sculpt... anything that can cement you as a visionary who foresaw the New Order&#39;s advantages before it happened.<br><br>-Food. Well, we started you out as a waitbeing, right? Use that! Make some of that weird Earth-food you remember, get your boss to sell it, and work your way up. You can be the Delia Smith of the Galactic Empire.<br><br>-The news. Much like the Arts line, this centres on providing commentary that will please the Emperor, before he&#39;s the Emperor. It&#39;s probably going to be trickier to get started, though, but if you see an opening...<br><br>-If all else fails, why not marry someone high-status? It&#39;s a nifty little back-door which could serve you well!<br><br>Whatever you choose to do, plot out your path and do your best to follow it. It&#39;s been a pleasure to serve as your Mysterious Voice from Above, but our time together is at an end - you&#39;re safe, you&#39;ve got your feet under you, it&#39;s time to make your own way in the world. Good luck, and may the Force not be with you, because that&#39;s treason!<br><br>Oh, and one final bit of advice: might be a good idea to move to Corellia in 20 years or so. Things are likely to get a bit messy on Coruscant when the Emperor dies...<br><br>((Well, you did it! By looking homeless and feeble enough that the Guard let you go, but you did it anyway! For what it&#39;s worth, I recommend the acting path - especially if you happen to look like any of the players in the Clone Wars, you could make an absolute <i>mint</i>. ~hS))</p>

            <p>It takes a while to get started, but before two years have passed your boss&#39; diner is selling spaghetti and meatballs like hot ryshcate. Of course, your boss is also taking all the credit...<br><br>You scrimp and save, and eventually make enough to start your own tiny stall. The meatballs stay in the old diner... now you&#39;re working on pizza.<br><br>You take Coruscant by storm, setting up a dozen franchise restaurants under the Empire. Then, keeping careful track of the news, you ship out to Corellia right as the Rebellion starts to rise.

            <p>And now, reading the subject of this thread, some of you will think: &quot;Well, no shoot Sherlock, what do you think this community is about?&quot;, but what I meant by it is, do any of you folks have any writing projects outside fan-fiction and missions? Your own universe with your own plot and characters? I know at least three of us (excluding me) that do, but I&#39;m curious to know if we have more. So why don&#39;t we come clean and share our deepest, darkest aspirations? I&#39;ll start!<br><br><br><br><br>So, in my universe, King Arthur&#39;s brotherhood of the Knights of the Round Table survived until the modern day, and expanded into a sort of secret police force that serves directly under the Queen (or King) of England, protecting the country from various threats, usually of paranormal origin: mostly monsters, but sometimes psychotic cultists, magicians, etc. <br><br>As I happen to be very unoriginal, you can spot several inspirations, including <i>The Dresden Files</i>, <i>Ranger&#39;s Apprentice</i>, and <i>The Order: 1886</i>. At first I wanted to write a series centered around the magicians of my universe (being the magic nerd I am), but then I got the Knights in the whole mess and decided that their story will come first and later... who knows.<br><br>What about you guys? Anything we can share? Maybe somebody else will have helpful tips about the specific genre you&#39;re writing for?</p>

            <p>I dabble here and there with different things (scripts, nonfiction, things written for role-playing purposes), but there are two universes that I focus the bulk of my attention on. The first is a contemporary setting with the presence of superpowers. They&#39;ve been present in the world for ages (due to the interference of magical outsiders during the ancient era) but were amplified during the 20th century due to things like the Tunguska explosion and rampant nuclear testing. There are many historical differences, most notable of which is the second Russian civil war in 1987 which resulted in the creation of several nations run by supervillains. I&#39;ve sketched out several different ideas for stories, but I often come back to the character of Jackie Wylde: a costumed criminal with a gambling motif operating in not!Philadelphia.<br><br>The second universe takes different elements of classic fantasy and puts them in a world with a tech level roughly equivalent to the 1910s. Autocarriages are gradually phasing out horses and carts, firearms and artillery have replaced magic and swords in the military, and global travel is becoming possible through massive airships. I&#39;ve focused mainly on an elf journalist by the name of Telly Oleithanam. He&#39;s a bit like Dorothy Parker mixed with P.G. Wodehouse&#39;s Psmith.</p>

            <p>Historiography essays, scholarly book reviews, and countless pages of research on gender, labor, and tribal sovereignty in the Pacific Northwest…<br><br>…and, of course, years of fiction writing, too. <br><br>I actually opened a Dropbox full of source materials a while back, but only a couple people were interested at the time. The &#39;verse was somewhat uncreatively dubbed &quot;Starships &amp; Sorcery,&quot; and the basic idea was that magic and post-light-speed tech (and highly specialized genetic modification, in some places) coexisted. Tech, in fact, was considered one of the major ways people could access high quantities of power. Essentially, the way magic worked was that all living things had some inside them, and channeling it was a skill. Some people did so through technology, but some people, of course, are not good at tinkering and engineering, so it was only a select group of people who had and actively used both skill sets, especially together. <br><br>The other sources of magic, though known to be so powerful that the risk of tapping into them was illegal in some places, and required great skill and usually very well designed machines in others, were planets and stars, which were known to have cores of immense power; stars emanate their energy, while planets have to be tapped into. <br><br>At this point, given the last little bit of trickery in the setting (and that my story has long since fizzled out), I&#39;ve been thinking it would make a better tabletop setting than an actual novel. I know some folks who are extraordinarily good at those designs, so I might give that a shot in my copious free time*, one of these days. <br><br><br><br><br>*Ha! Just kidding. </p>

            <p>I tend to think of a project, start it, then think of a different project and start on that one. I&#39;m not very good at finishing any of them. Thus, I have three or four &quot;novels&quot; that I should be working on <s>instead of writing Overwatch fanfiction</s>.<br><br>The first was a NaNovel from... two years ago? Maybe last year? I posted about it on the Board; basically, musical instruments and songs have magical power, with different songs doing different things and different instruments having different strengths. Violins are great at emotional magics, trumpets can knock walls down, that kind of thing. The actual <i>plot</i> of that novel was insipid, so right now this one is just a magic system.<br><br>The next one is more recent, and is about a Wrong Genre Savvy woman being tossed into a world of selkies, dragons, trolls, and Faeries. Basically, a twenty-something woman moves to Scotland to work as her mysterious uncle&#39;s housekeeper, and ends up becoming an apprentice alchemist, keeping magical creatures safe and brewing interesting potions. I like this one a lot; I think it has potential. <br><br>The third has maybe one page to its name and is only a week or two old. It&#39;s about an ensign training to be a starship pilot getting kidnapped by aliens who intend to sell her to a zoo or something similar. Not much to it yet, but I like it.<br><br>-Alleb</p>

Unfortunately, with Real Life being a pain, it&#39;s safe to say that I won&#39;t be able to actually write these works anytime soon, at least until I get a steady job as something to fall back on for when I eventually need the money to publish them both.<br><br>For the first project, I&#39;ve previously stated that I have a project that started out as a mega-crossover but now involves tons of expies of fictional characters in a multiverse of my own creation. &quot;Heroes of Yonder&quot; is basically an AU of popular culture as we know it - instead of so many continua being separate, interacting only sparingly and within their respective companies, the vast majority of fictional characters in this universe can meet up in a &quot;world beyond worlds&quot;-type place, broadcast to the real world in the style of an MMORPG/MOBA mix that&#39;s essentially a real-time fanfiction generator (you can play as both your player avatar/a generated OC a la the Mii Fighters from Smash 4, or as an &quot;instance&quot; of a &quot;canon&quot; character). The main antagonists are entities generated by players that were automatically rejected by Yonder&#39;s screening system for character legitimacy but somehow end up in whatever worlds they were intended for anyway, with the characters having to somehow get rid of them. It&#39;s a bit of a parody of fandom in general and fanfiction specifically, though I&#39;m trying to make it a well-written story in its own right; the fact that several of my PPC characters either come from or are planned to be integrated into this project is enough of an incentive for this particular goal, I hope.<br><br>The other project I have planned is &quot;Magizoic&quot;, which addresses and makes a decon/recon-fleet of one of the few things Heroes of Yonder won&#39;t cover, the Mons Game genre. Combining this with my love of speculative fiction, this is basically an AU future fic of Earth itself, where magic (and mana, its essence) is a thing, in no small part thanks to leakage from portals to the various elemental planes that cross over at the stellar coordinates of Earth, and a series of calamities has caused it to infuse the entire planet and all life upon it. Accelerated evolution, genetic and alchemical tampering, and alternative evolution have resulted in a wide variety of magical monsters known as Manazoids. In typical Mons genre fashion, combat with Manazoids is a worldwide sport, and one of the big highlights is a once-a-decade Olympics-style tournament - but the plot is kicked off by one of the countries participating suddenly imposing a punishable-by-death ban on Manazoid combat, with handlers of these creatures for that purpose being killed on sight. It&#39;s up to the main characters to escape the country, then figure out why, and finally undo this fatal policy and the world-destroying plot behind it - all before the tournament itself begins... in the country in question.<br><br>If anyone wants to talk to me about these particular projects, or lend their assistance with worldbuilding and character/plot ideas, please let me know! I&#39;d be happy to get feedback regarding them both, so I can make these projects as great as they can be. :D</p>

            <p>Honestly, the only two big things I&#39;m currently &quot;writing&quot; are novelizations of my Pearl and FireRed Nuzlockes, and the FireRed one&#39;s on hold while I revise a bunch of chapters/progress in the game. I keep getting ideas for a modern Zelda AU where Link is a Chinese-American girl, but I haven&#39;t really done anything plot-wise with that either.<br><br>I think my problem is that I have too many ideas and not enough time management/confidence to write them. I should get more serious about my writing...</p>

            <p>Currently on my 5th (I think) attempt at writing a dark (ish) superhero novel. You can see my previous attempt as my permission piece (Which I believe is still in the archives somewhere). <br><br>Basically it&#39;s kind set off of X-men, with new genetic strands giving a bunch of young people powers (the whole science behind it hasn&#39;t been fully worked out yet). But the world is a lot more xenophobic than today and so it&#39;&#39;s perfectly legal for people to kill these new Powered if they are &#39;attacked&#39; by them, and huge camps are set up focusing around enslaving and capturing/killing these Powered. The majority of the Powered who are free have subtle powers that aren&#39;t immediately obvious to the eye. I&#39;m thinking of trying to write three books in the series with the overall view getting lighter as the series goes on as more hope is introduced to the world. The first book is going to focus on the six protagonists (they&#39;re not really heroes, they&#39;re anti-heroes at best) who are trying to live their lives as normally as possible by day, and improve the situation for all Powered by night. Oh and they&#39;re all Students, none of the Powered are older than 25-30. The antagonists (the majority of whom are more like anti-villains than outright villains normally) are a similar bunch of Powered with slightly more extremist methods who are being controlled through their leader/telepath who is also the &#39;daughter&#39; (or possible clone of the mother) of a CEO of a large company (who will be the Big Bad of the book). I&#39;ve got the ideas for the first book all planned out I just have yet to start writing it up. </p>

            <p>It originated as a sort of personal project, but now I&#39;ve just sort of rolled it into a school project, as a major work kind of thing. I mean, it works in this particular case, as it&#39;s only really meant to be a single short story. <br><br>I&#39;m writing a dark, absurd cyberpunk comedy. The world is unofficially (everybody is generally too embarrassed to admit it) ruled by the monstrous bureaucracy that is the High Tide corporation, whose focus is equally split between things like shoelace manufacturing, and planning the construction of orbital lasers. <br><br>The natural human body most of us came pre-packaged in has been totally outdated, what with being packed with all those diseases and easily ripped skin and with not having even a <i>single</i> implanted cupholder. Bodies hold all the sentimental value of very complex scooters, the only difference being that you need to buy new ones more frequently because, really, who makes scooters? <br>Having broken parts is considered negligent, and is illegal, punishments going from fines to proper imprisonment. Even going insane is illegal - it&#39;s easy enough to just buy a new brain, isn&#39;t it? <br><br>The internet has evolved into Axiom, a constantly running AR display. Things like street signs, ads - a good portion of peoples&#39; appearances - are managed by the overlay. <br><br>Even war itself has been defeated by the advancement of technology, service in the military having become little more than an office job, as a result of advances in drone technology. How lovely! <br><br>The actual plot involves a soldier called Neil Wong losing his connection to Axiom. <br>He sees things that are very specifically designed to not be seen, and has a generally hard time of it. <br><br>I, er. Still haven&#39;t figured out a good title for it. <br>So, y&#39;know. You title-masters out there looking for practice, or some such. </p>

            <p>The Detective probably should have expected to run into the Aviator at Rudi&#39;s.

            <p>Yeah, that can be a bit tricky to navigate, especially when it&#39;s a twist on a common expression like this one is. My understanding is that, instead of &quot;no one could pay me to leave&quot; it&#39;s &quot;only the Aviator could pay me to leave&quot; (&quot;pay&quot; in this case is metaphorical--just meant as a way of making someone leave). I&#39;m guessing it&#39;s there to avoid the implication that the Detective might stay there against the Aviator&#39;s will.<br><br>(Another common use of this expression is &quot;you couldn&#39;t pay me to do that&quot;, where &quot;that&quot; is understood to be something the speaker wouldn&#39;t want to do. The thing has generally been mentioned or seen immediately before.)<br><br>Hope that helps (and the authors are obviously free to correct me and add context; this is what I&#39;m reading into it, not something they&#39;ve told me).<br><br>~Zingenmir</p>

            <p>Alright, so, I&#39;ve sort&#39;ve said this on Discord, and because I am a broken robot, doomed to say what it has once said again and again and again and what it has once said again and again and again and again, et al, I&#39;ll say it again: from a visceral point of view, it bloody works. It&#39;s a very rough, ugly situation, and the atmosphere made in it gets that across. It&#39;s <i>uncomfortable</i> feeling, it is. There are various moments where it delves into their individual thoughts (which sounds really quite trite right now, considering that all stories ought to do that, but give me a moment) and those are delivered in such a way as to get across that atmosphere. <br><br>Things like:  <br><i>&#39;He really did look like Gavan, and her hearts clenched at the thought. Gavan was dead, why should this even matter; why should she even care at this point?&#39;</i><br><br>And: <i>&#39;But he was hurting too. Only thing he had going for him was some stupid promise—some need to earn death, before he could finally go. Why shouldn&#39;t he do this?&#39;</i> <br><br>That self-doubt and discomfort is very evident, and, well. Relateable, I suppose, solely through delivery. <br>I mean, there&#39;s also odours. Odours can make anything look ugly. <br><br>So, this is probably stylistic, or some such. And I will admit to, at the very least, not having yet read all of the Aviator&#39;s stuff. <br>But I&#39;ll, er. Admit, I do find the Time Lord angst thing a little tiring, I don&#39;t want to say &#39;Oh, make them have a happy jolly good time and buy balloon animals and such!&#39; because, er. That&#39;s very trite, indeed, it wouldn&#39;t work, it&#39;s a clumsy solution, et al. <br>But from what I&#39;ve been seeing with these fellows, it really is near constant. I suppose I can say this more convincingly with the Detective (bloody sorry Aegis, but, er. Y&#39;know, haven&#39;t finished Ave&#39;s stuff, have finished yours, and such. Sorry, mate,) but I honestly cannot think of a single story or RP involving them where there isn&#39;t <i>some</i> form of angst. <br>And not to say angst is bad, or to say that having writing centred around angst and angsty characters having generally angsty times is bad, but I feel there ought to be a better balance! <br>I mean, again - I can&#39;t think of a single story or RP thingo involving one&#39;ve the two without <i>some</i> form of angst, and it, as with all overused sort of things, is beginning to feel a bit off, as it were. <br><br>So, er. Does the story work? Do what it&#39;s (I assume, anyhow,) what it&#39;s meant to do? <br>Yes! Well! <br>Did I get a little bit miffed when they mentioned that war, again? <br>Yes. I did. A little. <br>Is at least half of what I&#39;m saying really, really stylistic-based and subjective? <br>Most likely. <br><br>I&#39;ll say that you two certainly did something, whatsit, out of the box? Brave? <br>Brrrph, I dunno. <br>It took bollocks to do this sort&#39;ve story, is what I&#39;m saying, shake up status quo and such like that. And, I mean, it was ultimately delivered well, wasn&#39;t it? <br>So, brilliant job, there. <br><br>I mean, I&#39;m certainly interested in seeing where it goes! <br>Got a little thread at the end there with Zeb, and all.<br>And perhaps Ave and Dee&#39;ll get forced into a mission together, and we&#39;ll have the first mission in PPC history in which a pair of agents avoid eye-contact for the entire time. </p>

            <p>Well, I&#39;m certainly glad it didn&#39;t feel comfortable. <br><br>And while I can certainly understand finding angst one-note, I <i>will</i> take the time to point out that in the instance of two Time Lords with traumatic pasts attempting to block out the pain with one another, it really wouldn&#39;t do to have it go <i>un</i>mentioned.<br><br>As to my own stuff, I&#39;d only just introduced the character, and he&#39;s very driven by past trauma. While I shouldn&#39;t speak for Ix, I&#39;ll say that an even like that changes you, and Ix has handled the balance between not constantly bringing it up and still showing its effects rather well, in my opinion. That said, I can perfectly understand the criticism, considering I&#39;m an angst addict and bring it up given half a chance (and sometimes less) in Rudi&#39;s. <br><br>As to the mission—well, we&#39;ll see. Though Ave and the Detective certainly won&#39;t. They&#39;ll be too busy staring in opposite directions. <br><br>Thank you for the concrit!</p>

            <p>Hello, Lurker! I&#39;m going to give you a gift. Because I can. So there! You can&#39;t make me not treat you with kindness!<br><br>The gift in question: a full set of dice! It&#39;s all your favorite shapes - d3/4, d6, d8, 2d10 (your probability dice), d12, and a d20. The pattern is yours to choose! Do be careful when, how, and most importantly why you use them, though - dice have been known to have... certain amounts of power, when put in the right (or wrong, as it may be) hands.</p>

            <p>I and the other moderators for the Discord live chat would like the community&#39;s permission to use a channel exclusive to the moderators to discuss various issues which come up in the business of moderation. The benefits of this: no more having to constantly PM each other, which besides being convenient for us means that more mods will get a say on each issue, and that the records of complex mod decisions will all be in one place, which could make reviewing accusations of misconduct easier. The downsides of this: it sort of. . . might. . . look like we&#39;re setting up an exclusive secret clubhouse. That&#39;s not our intention, which is one reason we wanted to take this to the Board: to clear the air. <br><br>This downside may not look like much of a big deal, but it gets a bit knottier. Many of us mods haven&#39;t been in the PPC very long, so some of us would like to include some non-mod oldbies in the discussion to provide advice, historical knowledge, and &quot;oversight.&quot; Some people who can look at our conversations and go, &quot;whoa, whoa, we tried that back on IRC and it was a disaster, slow down.&quot; Doctorlit and Maslab have been popular requests. What do you guys think of that? Is it fine for us to just invite people as we see fit? Or should we create a special &quot;advisor&quot; role without mod powers but with access to our channel, and assign the role based on vote? Or are you against the whole idea? <br><br>--Key &amp; mods</p>

            <p>For lack of ways to go back through the Discord chat to find evidence of past misdemeanors, I took a screenshot of our most recent one and put it in the mod channel to better keep track of the &quot;three strikes rule&quot; we&#39;re (ostensibly) trying to implement. <br><br>However, this has brought a few things to light, namely, do we want to put a permanent record that will let people scroll through and use to shame people, even after they&#39;ve long since apologized/grown out of the habit of posting chat-inappropriate stuff? <br><br>Should there be a period of time where, if no strikes happen, the person gets their slate wiped clean? People change, after all, and it seems unfair to me to hold two strikes from two years ago against them* when taking into account future misdemeanors.<br><br>*In this case, I&#39;m imagining said misdemeanors are unrelated to their past ones; if they start up behavior identical or nearly so to what almost got them kicked in the first place, I think in that situation bringing up their past record would be applicable.<br><br>Thoughts?</p>

            <p>We already have a permanent record for the Board, and a fail to see how having a permanent record for the Discord is any different — save for, perhaps, ease of access?<br>Anyway, if someone wants to behave badly or bully someone, they&#39;ll find a way, misdemeanour record or no misdemeanour record, and the accountability this record affords us is important.</p>

            <p>(in that order)<br><br>The idea of a mod channel didn&#39;t come out of nowhere.It arose during discussions following a series of incidents involving GlarnBoudin and our (the mods, excluding Cat-on-the-Keyboard, who wasn&#39;t around for significant parts of this) handling of them.<br><br>Because those of you who aren&#39;t in chat much probably don&#39;t know what I&#39;m referring to (and in the interests of transparency), I&#39;m going to try and summarize the situation as I saw it.<br><br>GlarnBoudin joisted the chat a few months ago. While he was there, he repeatedly did unacceptable things, mostly in these categories:<br><br>1) Starting highly inappropriate/NSFW conversations in chat, and attempting to continue them even after being told that they were inappropriate and unwelcome (usually by multiple people)<br><br>2) Posting (often NSFW) nightmare fuel directly into chat (as in, the picture showed up directly in chat). The usual practice, if someone feels the need to link to that sort of thing, is to both warn people about what it is and (especially for images) to rot13 the link so it takes a bit more effort to open it.<br><br>3) Harassing Iximaz.<br><br>4) Harassing Iximaz&#39;s characters in the RP channel.<br><br>He was warned repeatedly about how these actions were unacceptable and that they should stop. Eventually, Desdenelle, Iximaz, and I came to the conclusion that enough was enough when Glarm posted a really creepy GIF in chat again. (Des had even warned Glarn after an earlier occurrence  that if he did something like that again where he could see it, he would be kicked, as it was his &quot;third strike&quot;). We PMed each other a bunch and realized we were all on the same page about this. The morning after that final infraction, Iximaz kicked GlarnBoudin from the chat, sending him the following message (<a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/221891633904484353/271845712097050644/Glarn.png">screenshot here</a>)<br><blockquote>
<br>Glarn,<br><br>Due to your repeated violations of the chat&#39;s rules, the other mods and I have decided to temporarily remove you from the PPC Discord. This is not a permanent ban, but we&#39;d like you to take some time off and think about why this happened, and when you feel you are ready to follow the rules, PM one of us for an invite back.<br><br>If you decide you would like to return, and continue your previous behavior, it will be brought to the Board&#39;s attention.<br>
</blockquote>
<br><br>Since this was a kick (and not a ban), Glarn is free to come back to the chat whenever he likes. However, he has not done so.<br><br>After all of this, we realized that our handling of this incident had not been very smooth. We&#39;d all been sending reminders and warnings repeatedly, but none of us knew in any detail what anyone else was doing or thinking. It took us a while to conclude that everyone else was also fed up with this, and a series of private conversations to decide on what to do. In retrospect, we figured this wasn&#39;t the best way to handle this type of incident, and so the idea of a mod channel came up.<br><br>I&#39;ve thought about this for a while, and I realized that this thread started with the wrong question. It asked &quot;How can the bods coordinate better?&quot;, when the more appropriate topic would be &quot;How do we handle this type of situation going forward?&quot; I think this is something we might want discuss as a community, so I&#39;d be glad to hear everyone&#39;s input.<br><br>There&#39;s also a sub-question &quot;What&#39;s the process for kicking someone from chat?&quot;, which I would like to get some clarity on (because &quot;the mods sort of make it up as they go along&quot; is not quite the right solution). Note that kicking just removes them from the server and they can (IIRC) come right back, unlike with a ban (which obviously requires a vote on the Board)<br><br>And finally, this is a page to GlarnBoudin, since accusing people (especially those who don&#39;t post here much) of doing bad things without letting them know about it is a bad thing.</p>

            <p>Like Tomash said, I wasn&#39;t around for most of this (life&#39;s a turd and I&#39;m an idiot; I really should take a break from the PPC but I love you all too much), so when I first heard about the need/desire for a mod channel, I kind of leaped on it, because. . . heh, I didn&#39;t know what had happened, so I immediately assumed that all the other mods were constantly having Important Discussions all the time which I was being left out of because no one bothered to PM me, and if the channel was set to &quot;all mods can participate,&quot; I&#39;d finally get a chance to prove that the community elected me for a reason. So for me, it was ALL about &quot;how do I get the scary oldbie mods to coordinate better with ME?&quot; *nervous self-deprecating giggle* (Looking back on it, it made perfect sense for people not to be asking for my input; I really wasn&#39;t there.)<br><br>But yeah, I didn&#39;t really know what I was talking about when I made the post. And as a newbie-turned-mod, I definitely think we need better protocol for kicks, because I am not confident enough to be sort of making things up as I go along. <br><br>Here&#39;s my thoughts: What happened with GlarnBoudin seems like it was handled well, just that the well-handling of it came later than it should have. Perhaps it would be better to do it with fewer warnings: if someone&#39;s violating the Constitution (by flaming, not warning for non-family-friendly content, etc.), and isn&#39;t being misunderstood (as per articles 5 and 8) and refuses to apologize (as per article 7), they should be kicked then and there, with a message to them explaining why. When they&#39;re ready to make reparations, they can PM a mod and ask to be invited back, with an apology and acknowledgement of their wrongdoing (to do this, all the mods need to be on the same page about why the person was kicked and what would constitute amends from this person). If they keep up their bad behavior, it&#39;s ban time and goes to the Board for discussion.<br><br>--the Littlest Mod</p>

            <p>So this is stream of consciousness and my interpretation of the situation at hand. I haven&#39;t really read all the other replies and thoughts, but here are mine.<br><br>To be quite honest, I feel this is a case where Glarn should be banned now. Not because he&#39;s been terrible, but because he should have been kicked multiple times before this.<br><br>Quite frankly, the mods and community in general should feel ashamed. I know I do. I joined the Discord a few months ago, and in that time I rarely recall Glarn not being aggressive with his discussion topics or feeling a need to dominate the discussion, and I repeatedly talked to a mod on there regarding his behavior in RP and other places, though I only really witnessed his behavior in an RP channel once. One of the times I had to get on him in voice chat was when he was insisting on discussing Jack Chick&#39;s views on sexual assault (thankfully he was angry at Jack Chick, but it was not a topic that anyone wanted to touch at the time).<br><br>For weeks and months the community allowed someone who we all knew was harassing a member to remain relatively consequence free. Sure we&#39;d get after him and he&#39;d be quiet for a bit when he got aggressive, but he would always quickly go right back to it.<br><br>And the problem is the person he was harassing was a mod. Someone who <i>should</i> have the power to distribute punishments as necessary, but felt they couldn&#39;t because this community thinks they&#39;re ban-happy and just trying to get back at the harasser who, I repeat, <i>repeatedly</i> harassed them.<br><br>I&#39;m ashamed for this leniency, and I want our mods in the channel to actually be able to exercise their power without the fear of an angry horde descending on them. Yes, mods should clearly not abuse their power and should themselves face consequences when they do abuse it, but it does the community on Discord no good when mods feel they can&#39;t do anything.<br><br></p>

            <p>I second Storme&#39;s post, and I&#39;m particularly concerned with your implication that <i>Iximaz</i> should feel ashamed over this when they were the one being harassed and definitely already feel crappy about it. Don&#39;t forget that they&#39;re included in &quot;mods&quot; when you say &quot;Quite frankly, the mods ... should feel ashamed.&quot; I&#39;m sure we&#39;d all be very pleased to see them stand up for themself more, and to never have cause to doubt that they have the support of the community if someone is being a jerk to them, but I certainly don&#39;t think they should be <i>shamed</i> over not wanting to abuse their mod powers to address what may have seemed like a personal issue.<br><br>Also, let&#39;s please bear in mind that this group of mods are all new to the role, and still learning how best to balance authority with forbearance (and vice versa). It&#39;s not something most people automatically know how to do, and if we punish them for having growing pains, I doubt they&#39;ll want to keep doing it for very long. I agree that they shouldn&#39;t have to feel afraid of reprisal for using their authority, but they shouldn&#39;t have to be afraid of reprisal for following their very respectable inclination toward patience and tolerance, either. We should be building their confidence, not tearing it down.<br><br>I really think you owe the community, the mod team, and especially Iximaz an apology.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Well to add on to my original post to try and clear things up: My problem isn&#39;t even specifically with individuals involved. It&#39;s to do with the PPC&#39;s culture and ideas of how a live chat should be run, in that it should be run essentially like the Board is. I feel that this is a poor way of doing things, since a live chat is fundamentally a different beast than forum postings.<br><br>This isn&#39;t the first time something like this has happened, and I&#39;m saying this as someone who feels he should have been banned years ago, too. That this has happened again and keeps happening is a sign that the community is past the point of needing to rethink how we manage live chats. It&#39;s not just this incident we should feel bad about (and I&#39;m restraining myself with how bad I feel, personally), it&#39;s that we seem to set this up to happen over and over again. And I dunno about you, but allowing such a culture that allows such things to take place multiple times and not feeling bad about it is, frankly, insensitive.<br><br>But that&#39;s me.<br><br>(Also I am not ignoring anyone. I&#39;m just posting once a day because this is something I&#39;m passionate about and I don&#39;t want to let my emotions run me over too much.)</p>

            <p>I took Maslab to mean &quot;PPC Culture, in general, has serious issues,&quot; and while I certainly agree that we have, in the past, tended towards <a href="http://www.plausiblydeniable.com/opinion/gsf.html">at least the first two</a> of the Geek Social Fallacies (namely, for those who don&#39;t want to click, &quot;Ostracizers Are Evil&quot; and &quot;Friends Accept Me As I Am.&quot; Those have definitely had a negative impact on our community in some cases, like that time we had someone being very homophobic and transphobic, harassing people*, and the conversation on whether or not to ban her caused a HUGE argument that left permanent rifts in the community. There were several examples of this on the old IRC in which I repeatedly came down on the &quot;endless chances! We can&#39;t ostracize them! What if they chaaaange?&quot; and &quot;you&#39;re being authoritarian!&quot; sides, which I freely admit now was a mistake and a half. <br><br>But, to that point, I will say, the PPC as a whole has changed a LOT. We&#39;re much better about this stuff now. I think each successive ban for Constitution-breaking and member-harassing behavior has been less dramatic, and more coherent and cohesive. I would say in the past, maybe many of us should be ashamed. But we are <i>growing</i> from our mistakes. That&#39;s what conversations like this are for. <br><br><br><br><br>*On the side of being fair: the person being harassed had not told almost anyone, and so there was a lot of miscommunication. </p>

            <p>I don&#39;t think it&#39;s very constructive to say &quot;we suck and should feel bad&quot; and leave it at that. In fact, I think it may be <i>de</i>structive, which is sort of ironic coming from someone advocating for a healthier PPC culture. Since I do believe Maslab is acting in good faith, though, and since the rest of the discussion <i>has</i> been constructive, there&#39;s no point for me to beat a war drum over it. Unless of course he&#39;d <i>like</i> for me to come down with a righteous fury on behavior I perceive as having the potential to create an unsafe environment for our mods? *shrug*<br><br>Oh, also, Maslab may not be aware of how much the PPC in general has stepped up their game as far as dealing with disruptive individuals goes. My sense of time is awful, so someone else will have to come up with actual numbers, but if you compare, say, the first ten years of the Board with the latest five (are we turning fifteen this year? is that right?), I think you&#39;ll find a dramatic increase of authoritarian-ness, and in a relatively narrow span of time. It&#39;s not like we&#39;re just letting assholes run rampant here.<br><br>We do give them the opportunity to stop being assholes, though, and that&#39;s not something I think should ever change.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

There was a very unfortunate lack of clarity regarding rules, process, and expectations, as well as a lack of communication within the mod team. These circumstances prevented the PPC from giving GlarnBoudin the series of consequences that would have made a long-term ban more than appropriate at this point.<br><br>Despite these reservations (and the fact that Grarn appears to have left of his own accord), I believe that something more must be done. What happened was unacceptable and wrong. We need to take a stand!<br><br>Therefore, I propose that some (at least one) of the following actions be taken with respect to GlarnBoudin. <br><br>1) When (if) he comes back, he gets <b>One. Last. Chance</b>. That is, if he goes onto the chat or the Board and starts harassing someone (especially Iximaz) again, being aggressively NSFW, or otherwise violating the Constitution, the incident shall be reported to the Board, and the banhammer falls then and there.<br><br>This automatic ban would be long (I&#39;d propose a year, but I don&#39;t have any firm commitment to that timeframe) and we would have the option to make it permanent at that time for egregious behavior.<br><br>If Glarn comes back and behaves for, say, 3 months, the hairtrigger probation will end and the full ban procedure will be back in effect.<br><br>I believe we have used a consequence like this in the past with Data Junkie.<br><br>2) <b>A short, symbolic ban</b>, lasting, <b>no more than a week</b>. This would, I believe, not be a significant restriction on Glarn&#39;s participation in the PPC, since he appears to have left voluntarily. It would, however, send a message that the kind of behavior Glarn exhibited will not be tolerated here.<br><br>I support <b>both of these things</b> (in the case of the symbolic ban, I support <b>three days</b>).<br><br>These are obviously not our only options (at the very least, &quot;long ban&quot; and &quot;don&#39;t do anything&quot; are valid votes, as is &quot;off with Tomash&#39;s head!&quot;), so feel free to propose whatever you&#39;d like in your replies.<br><br>- Tomash</p>

If the &quot;and then&quot; is removed, I could interpret this passing unanimously.<br><br><b>Short, symbolic ban:</b> 11% (Tomash and Akrinor)<br><br><b>Chat probation on return:</b> 6% (Tira)<br><br><b>Abstained:</b> A lot fewer people. By my count, there&#39;s around 50 people who posted on the Board or in the chat recently. If we take that to be the number of active PPCers (which is probably isn&#39;t because that&#39;s a slippery term), we have around 36% turnout. This seems pretty good, especially since that percentage counts newbies and people who basically lurk as abstaining, which makes it an underestimate of the actual turnout.<br><br></p>

            <p>... your &#39;basically the entire RP transcript&#39; consists of one character trying to talk to another and being grumped at. It includes an explicit statement by Iximaz that it&#39;s the <i>Aviator</i> who doesn&#39;t want to be there, not the author (at least, that&#39;s my interpretation of &#39;She&#39;s in a bad mood, can you tell?&#39;). Is Sesrik bugging the Aviator? Clearly yes. Much like all HQ&#39;s Time Lord always niggle at the Notary, and like various Plort characters love getting a dig in at Baron hS. <br><br>Frankly, it looks like Glarn looks up to Iximaz and wants to interact with them, and is putting on the most cheerful face they can and trying to push past the Aviator&#39;s mood to do so. The same applies to the &#39;miscellaneous harassment&#39; at the bottom of the page - how exactly is &#39;It would be fun for my character and yours to have drunken interactions&#39; harassment? Are you defining the word to mean &#39;any attempt to interact&#39;?<br><br>The <b>non</b>-RP sections, by contrast, are pretty awful. I&#39;m going to assume there was more stuff between April last year and the present.<br><br>... does anyone know how old GlarnBoudin is? I ask because I&#39;m seeing a lot of &#39;me as a teenager&#39; in these transcripts. Fixating on people and trying to interact with them when they want nothing to do with you? Check. Being dark and &#39;edgy&#39; to try and carve out a space as an Interesting Person to Keep Around? Check. Occasionally combining the two in such a way that you just plain freak out someone you want to befriend? Check, check, and double check.<br><br>All of which is terrible behaviour. All of which needs to be unlearned, and is absolutely potential grounds for banning. But none of which, in my case, was malicious or malevolent, and all of which (I hope!) I&#39;ve managed to work past. If GlarnBoudin is in the same stage of life as I was, I hope he, too, can eventually get past it.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>One of my RP-only characters, a <i>Darkest Dungeon</i> Plague Doctor named Paracelle, makes Iximaz uncomfortable to be around. Ix told me this. I no longer RP as that character when Ix is about.<br><br>Glarn was in a similar scenario. Rather than back off however, he totally ignored their requests and continued to try and engage them in an RP in which they did not want to take part. Over and over again. Regardless of intentions, this is harassment, and I am in support of chat mods having the power to kick and/or ban people for harassment, especially when, and this is important, <i>they are the ones being harassed</i>.<br><br>Let&#39;s go the other way. Let&#39;s say they don&#39;t kick/ban people for harassment of this nature, or for posting deeply unpleasant things in group fora despite being repeatedly told not to do so. What confidence can users who aren&#39;t mods have in the system then? When one of those selfsame mods is harassed by a user breaking the rules they are supposed to enforce, what confidence can they have that the mods will help them should they themselves ever be attacked, or harassed, or bullied?<br><br>We have these mods, and they have these powers. It is up to them to use them in a fit and proper manner, with the rest of the community acting as checks and balances against abuses of that power -- but &quot;fit and proper&quot; implies using those powers for their intended purpose.<br><br>Sorry for ranting. This is why I didn&#39;t vote; I&#39;d just end up shouting at everyone.</p>

            <p>I would also like to note that I can&#39;t find any indication in this thread that GlarnBoudin was asked to stop RPing with Iximaz. The closest is a mention that Iximaz said they won&#39;t co-write with him, which is a different thing.

            <p>I think it&#39;s clear that GlarnBoudin&#39;s character was harassing Iximaz&#39;s. On thinking about this further (and looking up &#39;harassment&#39; on Wikipedia, yes seriously), the following things pop out:<br><br>-While we are not our characters, we&#39;ve known since Jay and Acacia that almost everybody closely identifies <i>with</i> their characters. I take attacks on Baron hS more personally than I should, for instance. So it&#39;s perfectly understandable for Iximaz to feel harassed because their character was. (My missing this goes to my strenuous efforts to not feel that way myself; I glossed over the whole idea.)<br><br>-That goes both ways. <b>GlarnBoudin</b> probably (subconsciously if not openly) identifies Iximaz with the Aviator, and himself with his characters. So there is an element of direct harassment in there, even though it&#39;s all ostensibly fictional. (This one goes to me not having much experience RPing or cowriting.)<br><br>-The sort of fixating-attention-getting behaviour GlarnBoudin directed at Iximaz goes by another, quite nasty name: stalking. It doesn&#39;t hit the common image of &#39;lurking outside the window&#39;, but it absolutely is. (I missed this one because... yeah, I&#39;d rather not go into it, but it goes back to those comparisons with me as a teenager.)<br><br><b>Conclusions:</b><br><br>-GlarnBoudin engaged in harassing behaviour towards Iximaz, which is against the spirit of the PPC constitution, and is grounds for banning.<br><br>-The PPC constitution as presently written doesn&#39;t actually cover this sort of harassment: it assumes that &#39;harassment&#39; will be straight-up attacks and bullying. If the Board comes up with a way to put it in (probably in Article 1), I&#39;ll do the paperwork side to get it on the doc.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I&#39;m pretty sure that definition means you can&#39;t repeatedly tell someone they&#39;re not listening to concrit.

            <p>Re: 2 -  I don&#39;t think a short, symbolic ban would have much effect, to be honest, since Glarn isn&#39;t really around to be affected by it.  Any other disciplinary actions would send the same message.<br><br>Re: 1 - I think this is the very least that should be done; however, I think it&#39;s also somewhat risky, since from what little I saw of this, Glarn never showed any remorse for his actions.  I&#39;d at least recommend that he be banned from Discord for a while after he returns, and only allowed back in once he demonstrates good behavior (perhaps a certain period of activity on the Board without any issues?).  I also think any instances of harassing a member, at any point, should be met with a permaban.  </p>

            <p>I can see both sides of the debate about 2, and I&#39;m all in favor of 1. I get that punishing Glarn in absentia not only seems kind of cruel, but also does nothing to discourage him.<br><br>However, I think something should still be done if he were to resurface tomorrow. Perhaps a few days&#39; ban if Glarn comes back within a certain timeframe? I don&#39;t know, personally.<br><br>For what it&#39;s worth, I&#39;m sorry I didn&#39;t speak up, either. Not beyond calling him out a couple of times.</p>

            <p>In this instance, I vote for one last chance, and a Permaban if he violates the Constitution, to be posted to the &#39;Board.

            <p>1) sounds fair enough, and if he continues being stubborn it will give the clear message that it was his mistake. I also don&#39;t approve of 2) because it makes us look like we&#39;re turning rabid and jumping on him, which won&#39;t help the situation.

            <p>I don&#39;t think &quot;turning rabid and jumping on him&quot; is a fair description of our behavior.  Aside from the fact that &quot;rabid&quot; isn&#39;t a very good description for a bunch of people sitting around and calmly discussing a topic, it&#39;s sort of implying that we&#39;re unfairly persecuting him.

            <p>On 1) : I personally think a ban lasting one year (if I understood your post correctly, that is what you&#39;re proposing) would be too long. I&#39;d propose something more like 3 months at most, since that is, for most cases, plenty of time to rethink oneself&#39;s behaviour very thoroughly.

            <p>I understand a year might seem like too long, but when someone <i>harasses other PPCers</i>, repeatedly, despite being warned multiple times and asked to stop, I think a Permaban shouldn&#39;t be out of the question; if we were to set a time, a year seems perfectly legitimate. This isn&#39;t a case of one or two isolated incidents in a heated moment - this sounds like someone who has consistently acted without any regard for feelings that aren&#39;t theirs. </p>

            <p>I second your regrets - and add one of my own, namely that I regret not paying enough attention to have seen the situation happening before it was pointed out to me.<br><br>That said, I support action one but not two. Given that our problem was in acting on our principles, I don&#39;t think that more words (which is what 2 seems to be advocating for) is a useful thing to do - the message will be sent much more clearly when we act immediately next time.</p>

            <p>Based on my interactions with GlarnBoudin and what I&#39;ve heard besides, I&#39;d have kicked that guy ages ago. He definitely earned it on the basis of violations of articles 1.5 and 12, at least.<br><br>My opinion is that I like a &quot;three strikes and you&#39;re out&quot; policy for real time situations. Here&#39;s how I think bad behavior in the chat ought to be handled, generally:<br><br>1. Someone (let&#39;s call them Sassafras) does something inappropriate.<br><br>2. People tell them &quot;Hey, that&#39;s inappropriate/making us uncomfortable/clearly in violation of the Constitution. Please stop.&quot; Preferably as clearly as possible, so there can be no confusion; hinting may work for many people, but not for everyone. (I&#39;m thinking of our Aspie population and others on the autism spectrum, many of whom I&#39;ve known to request blunt feedback precisely to avoid giving offense by mistake.)<br><br>3. Sassafras does it again. Maybe right away, maybe after making excuses and grudgingly subsiding for awhile. Whichever.<br><br>4. People tell them &quot;You&#39;re doing that thing again. It&#39;s still not cool. You&#39;d better apologize and never do it again. This is your second warning. If it happens again, you may be kicked.&quot;<br><br>5. Sassafras has not been paying attention and does it again anyway.<br><br>6. A mod says &quot;Sassafras, this is the third time you&#39;ve done that thing you were told not to do. I&#39;m kicking you from the chat. Go reread the Constitution.&quot;<br><br>7. Supposing Sassafras comes back after being kicked and STILL does the offending thing, then they clearly cannot be taught, and they get banned.<br><br>This presumes that the mod is aware of the previous infractions, of course. You guys should probably be in the habit of communicating with each other about rules violations and warnings when they happen, yes?<br><br>Note that the mod in this scenario shouldn&#39;t necessarily have to confer with other mods when it comes time for the kick, though. Although I completely understand that it&#39;s nice to have backup, it sort of defeats the purpose of having mods at all if they aren&#39;t prepared to take action when it&#39;s needed, y&#39;know? Supposing it&#39;s a time when only Desdendelle is online, for instance, because of time zones, I would hope he wouldn&#39;t hesitate to kick someone who was clearly in violation of the Constitution and multiple warnings had already been issued. That&#39;s one major reason to have multiple mods, so that the channel can be covered by at least one at all times.<br><br>That said, I think a mods-only channel is fine, by the way. It would make the above-mentioned communication easier, real time or otherwise, and it is completely appropriate for moderators to discuss how best to moderate without interference from the peanut gallery, especially if they need to discuss someone who is actually in the chat causing trouble at the time. If it does lead to the mods behaving badly due to becoming a clique that badmouths people and kicks anyone they don&#39;t like regardless of Da Rules, it WILL come out, and there WILL be drama. So, y&#39;know, don&#39;t. {= )<br><br>Frankly, I trust the current mods enough to let them do their job whether I can see them doing it or not. (Since I&#39;m not in the chat much, I mostly don&#39;t anyway.) If the population of the chat has no faith in a mod or mods, then we&#39;re still discussing the wrong question.<br><br>~Neshomeh<br><br>P.S. BTW, would you guys like a set of RP principles and guidelines? I was kicking the idea around idly this morning just to amuse myself, but I&#39;d be happy to write something up for discussion if you like. I don&#39;t RP as much as I used to, but I used to A LOT, and I know of what I speak. (Basically, RP is like sex: consent and communication are very important!)</p>

            <p>Everything honestly looks really above-board right now. And, given how nasty the Glarn situation seemed to get, I&#39;d be all for giving the mods power to be a little quicker and a little more coordinated in the future. And... that does seem like the form of a mod-chat to talk on the subject.<br><br>Honestly, it&#39;s probably better than emails, in the long run; more instantaneous, everything is in one place, etc.<br><br>And this really, really shouldn&#39;t happen again, though I completely understand why it did.

            <p>I do think that someone could be aggressively in violation of the constitution to the point of warranting less warnings, but for general problems, that process sounds entirely reasonable.<br><br>And I agree, a mods-only channel really does seem like the right way to organize.

            <p>I was wondering why Glarn was no longer listed on the chat, and I wanted to ask him personally, but I was too afraid that something bad had happened and that he&#39;d lash out at me if I asked him about it (as he&#39;s done at least once before). <br><br>Having been involved to some extent in the tense situations with Glarn on the chat, and having tried to field him before as a friend and confidant, I can say with confidence that he isn&#39;t a victim, and if you&#39;ll forgive my being the pot that calls the kettle black a little, I can&#39;t condone his behavior in general because for the love of Arceus, <i>I&#39;ve been there before.</i> I&#39;ve repeatedly stated that he has to stop and think about what he&#39;s done, since I&#39;d rather not witness a repeat of what happened to me while I was in that one DeviantArt group project that kicked me out a few years ago. I wasn&#39;t around to see the aftermath, but from what I heard, the drama caused by this and several other bad situations pretty much forced the group to start over from scratch (since they&#39;d been around for only one to two years and not the PPC&#39;s ten or more).<br><br>That being said, I have to second Des regarding the matter of holding back. I still stand by the notion that the entire fiasco regarding Glarn was handled poorly and with no consistent communication between ANYBODY, period. Nesh&#39;s rules on handling chat offenders are pretty solid IMO although I also agree that Board and chat posting are different enough to warrant their being handled separately - at least on the Board, mishaps like blowing up at someone can be seen publicly and can thus be more effectively handled by any and every mod available. Now, I realize that I am in absolutely no position to get into any arguments, since my jumping in has backfired on me too many times to count, but at the same time I want to make sure that difficult situations like this don&#39;t happen again.<br><br>So to this end, may I propose another addendum to Nesh&#39;s suggestion? I&#39;m honestly not so sure if it would be a good idea for Discord chat invites to be handed out arbitrarily and to everyone who visits the Board without the assurance that they understand the Constitution. So next time you guys intend to invite someone to the chat, perhaps you could contact them privately beforehand and ask if they understand the Constitution well enough not to cause any trouble while they&#39;re there? I&#39;m aware that this may sound a little harder on the Boarders, especially the newbies, but I think it&#39;d be better for everyone in the long term. An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure, as they say. (With this in mind, I also approve of RP channel rules as well, for the same reason as with the chat and its participants in general.)</p>

            <p>I think that, in my particular case, I&#39;d rather be gun-shy than trigger-happy, because unlike the other mods (who were elected by the Board), I&#39;m a mod because I&#39;m the owner of the channel — I&#39;m the unelected dictator pulling strings in the background, as things are. While it seems that people trust me enough with those powers, I&#39;d rather err on the side of caution than mess up and cause Drama.<br>&#39;sides of which, I&#39;d rather not kick someone out of anger. I know I have a tendency to jump the gun when I&#39;m pissed off; that&#39;s why I try to wait, observe and reflect before doing such things.<br><br>Anyway, I like the procedure you&#39;ve outlined, except for #7: I still think that a ban is something for the Board to discuss, not for the Discord mods to mete out for repeat offences; admittedly, I can see a case where a person keeps getting kicked out of the channel, but I think it is not the same thing as being banned.<br><br>(Also, obligatory YGOTAS quote: &quot;Playing card games is just like making love. You usually do it on a table, and you always feel deep shame when it&#39;s finished. Also, the older you get, the less fun it is.

            <p>So, I think the proposal Nesh outlined is a good one, and it actually feels like what we tried to do in the Glarn situation. I agree with Des that a chat ban shouldn&#39;t be separate from a general PPC ban, and so actual bans need to be discussed on the Board.<br><br>Also, the chat is one of the PPC&#39;s spaces, just like the Board and the Wiki, so separate bans and controlling invites (like Skarm proposed) don&#39;t seem right.<br><br>I&#39;ve also got a few minor points I&#39;d like to tack on to the &#39;Sassafras process&#39; that seem like good ideas:<br><br>1) Kicks should be announced publicly in chat in a somewhat prominent way (@everyone-ing and/or posting the message in #notice_board seems appropriate here) and the announcement should include some explanation of why this was done (quotes and evidence might be wise here, if possible). If this doesn&#39;t happen, there should be Drama.<br><br>2) Warnings have a reasonable expiration date<br><br>3) If someone is kicked and then comes back, they&#39;re presumed reformed. If they keep doing the bad stuff, the remedy is a Board thread so that the community can decide what to do about this.<br><br>I think, Nesh, you&#39;ve done a good job of summarizing the arguments for a mod channel, and I agree with them. As far as I&#39;m concerned, the point of the mod channel is to keep a relatively clean log of bad stuff/warnings/etc. and to call for second opinions if someone thinks they&#39;re not uninvolved enough in something.<br><br>As a general reminder, you can summon the mod team to something with @Moderator.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m sorry for making you uncomfortable.

I know better than to make fun of people with disabilities. I know better than to call people names.

            <p>Have you considered e-mail? It solves all those problems you mentioned: giving everyone a chance to have a say, having a complete record in one place (as long as everyone remembers to hit Reply All), including oldbies for perspective if you wish. I know it&#39;s not necessarily real time, but I tend to consider that a positive, too. Taking your time to think your responses through when discussing serious issues is a <i>good</i> thing. {= )<br><br>I suppose it doesn&#39;t quite answer the &quot;secret clubhouse&quot; issue, but it doesn&#39;t exactly have the same feeling as setting up a private chatroom, does it? I don&#39;t think anyone can seriously object to people exchanging e-mails when they don&#39;t want to drag everyone into a conversation. That&#39;s what e-mail is <i>for</i>, yes?<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I&#39;m pretty sure they did something similar on the IRC, and it was a disaster. ;) Basically because it was an exclusive secret clubhouse used for insulting people behind their backs.<br><br>Now, I&#39;m perfectly happy to watch the idea of a PPC chatroom collapse for, what, the fourth time?

            <p>I&#39;m not going to dive too deeply into rehashing the mess that was the irc, but that is not a terribly accurate depiction of what happened. The alt channel was created by people who were tired of all the yelling and drama in the main chat, and when the people more prone to yelling discovered its existence, the yelling intensified.<br><br>This is a different idea, being implemented on a platform that has a normal interface for multiple channels- in case you haven&#39;t poked your head in recently, we currently have six for various purposes.<br><br>(Also, could you maybe think twice about how much you know about a half of the community that you&#39;ve never participated in?

            <p>First off, again, I&#39;m sorry that I came across as shutting you down. I used some pretty snide turns of phrase and I really should have thought twice before opening my big mouth.<br><br>That said - I was reading some pretty dismissive things into your post, and reacting to that reading. I feel like your comparison to the mess around the IRC was dredging up past drama for drama&#39;s sake rather than being terribly relevant to the current situation, and then your questions posed &quot;in the interest of fairness&quot; felt to me like they were some sort of requirements that you were imposing on a Discord moderation process, rather than prompts for discussion.<br><br>So - to respond directly, I absolutely believe you are allowed to have your own opinions, although I do have to wonder what you mean when you say &quot;the chat&quot; - the active users on the Discord in the last week (that I&#39;ve seen) have been a different group of people than were on the IRC in either its heyday or the days of drama, and also a different group of people than we had on the dear old Bravenet chat back in the dark ages. The chat is not a monolith, and I feel like you&#39;re assuming that it is.<br><br>My take on your second thought is a bit more nuanced - it seems to me that there are a great many comments that could be made about the chat, some of which are more valid and some of which are less so. People are people everywhere, and the constitution is the constitution everywhere, so discussing what is and isn&#39;t acceptable on those levels is very relevant and valid. But on the other end of the validity scale, were a discussion about, I don&#39;t know, the appropriate time to link something in #generic<em>channel rather than #recs</em>and_plugs to spill over onto the Board, I&#39;m not sure how useful the comments of someone who wasn&#39;t familiar with the norms of discord would be - while the end goal of having a nice smooth conversation is shared by everyone everywhere, what that looks like on the discord is rather different from what that looks like here. We only have experience with what we have experience with - I certainly don&#39;t think that I would be able to offer valid comments on Wiki governance issues beyond very high-level Constitutional stuff, because I haven&#39;t been significantly involved in the wiki in years.<br><br>And finally, to answer the questions you posed - the current suggestion on the table is to have the mods channel be readable by everyone, but only allow mods to post there. Between that and the mods&#39; incentives for keeping chatter on that channel to a minimum (to make catching up on incidents quicker), there should be very little chatter that isn&#39;t discussion of moderation issues. And having it be globally readable should address your second question.<br><br>(For comparison&#39;s sake, how does the Board handle transparent discussion between moderators?)</p>

            <p>I do actually think that &#39;is not used to attack&#39; and &#39;is not percieved as such&#39; should be requirements for any moderation process (as I&#39;m sure everyone does?), but I&#39;d not describe my post as trying to impose them.<br><br>As to the rest: Cat&#39;s post specifically discussed avoiding things that caused problems in the IRC. I used that as a hook to explain my concern. For what it&#39;s worth, while I&#39;m concerned that the current proposal seems to be being analysed for its positives rather than its negatives, I can&#39;t actually see any problems with it. So, yay?<br><br>I don&#39;t see the chats across history as a monolith - the problems with the Bravenet chat are very different to the problems from the IRC - but I do see live chat as a fertile breeding ground for serious issues. Apparently you&#39;ve already had at least one, per the discussion up-thread. But yes, I have an outsider&#39;s and a skeptic&#39;s (or cynic&#39;s) view, and those tend to highlight the negatives. So I&#39;ll believe you when you say it&#39;s generally a good place.<br><br>As to your comparison with the Board:<br>-The Board isn&#39;t moderated.<br>-Actual spam is deleted without discussion.<br>-Bans are publically discussed and voted on.<br>-Neither the Nameless Admin(s) nor the Permission Givers use a PPC space for private discussion, which was the proposal here.<br>-Ultimately, the answer is that we are all moderators on the Board, and that discussion happens publically or by email.<br>(Since you know all that, I&#39;m just gonna assume you had a reason for asking that I can&#39;t spot.)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>As a community, we provide various spaces - the Board, T-board, the chats, the LJ-DW comm - for people to interact in. We have expectations about how they will do that, embodied in the Constitution. And we have community oversight: if something happens contrary to the Constitution, everyone can know it happened, and have an informed opinion.<br><br>An official PPC space where some people can&#39;t go breaks that. It says: &#39;we are the ones allowed to judge our behaviour. Your opinion, as a member of the community, is no longer relevant&#39;. Whether or not the people in question - and all potential future users - are trustworthy, that&#39;s a message I don&#39;t like the sound of.<br><br>(I&#39;m aware that the old chats also lacked that kind of public record. Things on this thread have implied Discord retains logs, which is good.)<br><br>It&#39;s also simply exclusionary: in a supposedly equal community, there is suddenly a place that some people aren&#39;t allowed to go. Cat also suggested adding certain oldbies to the channel, which means it&#39;s not just elected moderators: it&#39;s &#39;this channel is for the worthy, and you are not worthy&#39;. Again, not a message I feel we should send.<br><br>Contrast email. It&#39;s not a community space. It hasn&#39;t been set up by the community. It&#39;s not under the full Constitution.

            <p>But a bunch of the other mods were really keen on having their input, which is why I suggested the idea of an advice-giver role as a compromise: voted on by the community, they&#39;d be trusted enough to participate in the decision-making process but not enough to make final decisions.

            <p>I&#39;m going to assume you don&#39;t mean Section 3 should be followed in emails, and that you&#39;re mostly looking at Sections 1 &amp; 2. By and large, they should indeed be followed - but check out the context: <i>Don’t engage in bullying behaviour, and don’t say anything about another PPCer you wouldn’t say to their face. Harassing others by private means is just as serious as harassing them in public, if not more so, and will be treated as such.</i><br><br>There are things you&#39;ll say to your friends that you wouldn&#39;t say <b>in the same way</b> to someone&#39;s face. If Sassafras is refusing to listen to concrit, you might email your friend to say &quot;argh, why won&#39;t they listen?!&quot; - whereas to them, you&#39;d say &quot;I really think you could benefit from taking this on board.&quot; In a community space, the former is borderline flaming, because you&#39;re broadcasting your frustration to everyone. In a private email, it&#39;s just an expression of frustration.<br><br>It goes the other way, too: I&#39;ve been more forceful to people about their own behaviour by email than I would be on the Board, because I know that it won&#39;t be picked over by everyone else - it won&#39;t influence how other people view them.<br><br>Coming back to your question: I was the first commenter. No-one had suggested the PMs at that point. ;) As far as I&#39;m aware, they&#39;re just emails under a different name, so I don&#39;t know that it would be different.<br><br>(Not coming off as antagonistic, don&#39;t worry.

            <p>From the outside, with the power dynamics suggested being reversed (the secret IRC channel last time was created by non-mods, if I recall, whereas this time it&#39;s being created by mods), it did a bit look like that. <br><br>However, I think you&#39;ve more or less described the solution; as of now, all the PPC channels are public. I think a &quot;mods discuss issues&quot; channel is fine - but why not just make it public to the community? Those interested in the issues being discussed can chime in when they have an opinion, and otherwise it&#39;s quiet or just mods going &quot;Hey, I did X at Y time, is everyone okay with it?&quot;<br><br>I get the appeal of not opening it, but I think the key to good authority and good relationships with authority is not having people feel that their mods are some kind of class set apart. </p>

            <p>Here are seven clear indications that it&#39;s Nume, not Ilraen, before the glasses come into it:<br><br>1. The whole story has been from Nume&#39;s POV. There&#39;s no reason for anyone to assume a switch to Ilraen&#39;s POV without notice.<br><br>2. The last sentence of the paragraph previous to &quot;He woke slowly&quot; tells of Nume going to sleep, therefore it follows that Nume is the one waking up. Again, if I had meant to switch to Ilraen, I should have given notice.<br><br>3. The reader should know from the previous paragraph that Ilraen has returned to his Andalite form, therefore he has no hair on his scalp; only fur.<br><br>4. Since Ilraen is in his Andalite form, his speech would be set off with &lt;angle brackets,&gt; not &quot;quotation marks.&quot;<br><br>5. Ilraen&#39;s speech patterns are markedly different from Nume&#39;s: he would never say &quot;knock it off.&quot;<br><br>6. Ilraen has no mouth and therefore no need for a toothbrush.<br><br>7. Nume was the one who struck his head against the gates at the Ministry, and anyway, Ilraen has no eyebrows.<br><br>Given all that, I feel I&#39;ve done more than enough to convey the fact that it&#39;s Nume we&#39;re dealing with, not Ilraen. I&#39;ll grant you that it&#39;s easier to spot <i>all</i> the clues if you know what an Andalite looks like, but a) that problem is more easily solved by a new reader using Google than by me wasting words describing it over and over in every episode of my spin-off; b) clues 1 and 2 alone should be indication enough; and c) most readers should be able to grasp 4, 5, 7, and possibly even 6 just from this story whether they know anything about Andalites or not.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Well, I didn&#39;t see that many missions where no killing is involved, or DIC without any sort of things which should be killed (guess it&#39;s time to fish for more DIC Spin-offs).

            <p>I wish it were easier to find missions without killing in them in departments that aren&#39;t supposed to be about Suvians. That&#39;s actually one reason I wanted to write for the DIC, because I wasn&#39;t too sure about doing the whole assassination thing back when I joined. As it turned out, I got over it by the time I started writing—but I do try to at least come up with creative solutions for the team&#39;s baddies, and avoid calling &quot;character replacement&quot; unless there&#39;s a name change on top of them being very OOC.<br><br>That said, there are some fairly solid storytelling reasons that Sue missions are easier to write, and Suvians do crop up just about everywhere. *shrug*<br><br>Like I said to Tomash, I wouldn&#39;t hold your breath waiting for more about Nume. I&#39;m kinda feeling sorry I set it up as some sort of deep dark horrible traumatizing secret, cuz I didn&#39;t mean to. There&#39;s stuff he&#39;s not telling anyone, sure, but he&#39;s pretty much just bitching and moaning there, and Jenni latches onto it because she&#39;s Jenni and she just can&#39;t help herself.<br><br>Glad you liked that other bit, though. Nice to know someone caught it. ^_^<br><br>Thanks for commenting!<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Well, it seems that some more Neshomeh/Iximaz cowrites will be in store, yes? I, too, wonder how Farilan will react to that Monster Book of Monsters.<br><br>One error and one comment:<br>The error:<br><i>Where did he get that? Never mind,&quot; he interrupted as Ilraen started to respond; &quot;he pulled it out of his a**, that&#39;s where.&quot;</i><br><br>That semicolon should be a period or a comma.<br><br>The comment:<br><i>Sandra pulled out her wand and began chanting, almost singing. &quot;</i>Vulnus Sanetur<i> . . . &quot; She waved the wand over the wound once . . . &quot;</i>Vulnus Sanetur<i> . . .&quot; twice . . . &quot;</i>Vulnus Sanetur<i>.&quot;</i><br><br>Correct Latin, but perhaps incorrect spellcasting? The HP Wiki lists the spell as <i>Vulnera Sanentur</i>, and it doesn&#39;t show that the incantation switches to the singular if a singular wound is being healed. My HP knowledge is very limited, so I don&#39;t know about this.</p>

            <p>First, thanks for commenting! Yes, the Saga of Faraen will continue. {= )<br><br>I disagree that the semicolon is in error. If I were to write out the dialogue uninterrupted by narration, it would read &quot;Never mind; he pulled it out of his a**, that&#39;s where.&quot; A comma would clearly be incorrect there, and while I could use a period, I prefer the semicolon to show that the thoughts are connected and, taken together, mean &quot;Disregard the previous question and take this statement in its place.&quot;<br><br>You&#39;re right about <i>Vulnera Sanentur</i>, but since the incantation is from the movieverse and not the books, I decided to err on the side of correct grammar.

            <p>You&#39;re correct that without the tag in the middle, that semicolon would be exactly what&#39;s needed. My issue, however, is with where the semicolon is now. As currently written, there&#39;s nothing showing that the semicolon would be what would have been in the quotation. However, without a grammar book to reference, I&#39;ll just let the matter drop for now.<br><br>As for the Latin, thanks for the explanation.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m glad you felt there was enough of the badfic. Phobos suggested that I put a bit more mission in the mission, but I honestly couldn&#39;t stand to look at the original fic for too long, and I couldn&#39;t find that many good gags to wring from it, in spite of its complete stupidity.

            <p>Props to you for having the patience to read through this fic; just the samples you put in were enough to make me cringe.<br><br>And Ilraen... poor Ilraen. I almost feel bad about introducing Farilan now, except it&#39;s too much fun watching Nume get worked up over his partner zoning out at the worst times.<br><br>I liked the montage of the agents wandering around Diagon Alley and generally getting the chance to have a breather for once in their lives. I will admit I wasn&#39;t such a fan of them getting their own wands (hit a bit too close to all the Sue montages I&#39;ve seen, maybe?), but I did like Mr Ollivander having connections to Meir Brin. It made me smile.<br><br>(Also, slightly off-topic, but Ilraen saying &quot;I&#39;ll use my own. Mouths do have some very serious disadvantages.&quot; made me think of Bleep patches, like nicotine patches but with Bleep. Carrying on...)<br><br>I don&#39;t know FMA, but the Harry Potter parts were just so full of cringe. Just... yowza. If the FMA parts were half as bad (and I get the feeling they were <i>worse</i>)... guh. <br><br>And poor Ilraen needs hugs, desperately. I&#39;ll admit to actually gasping out loud when he got hurt, and teared up a bit at the end there. Nume really does care about him... he&#39;s just not very good at showing it. ;)<br><br>Great mission, and definitely worth the wait.<br><br>-Ix<br><br>PS: Philosophies Stone has to be my favorite mini to date (well... after Death Easters). I might just have to adopt him.<br><br>PPS: &quot;Nume flashed him again to be safe.&quot; <s>Nuuuume, you tease</s></p>

            <p>Often, you superficially answer questions, but don&#39;t address the issues in your writing which they refer to. For instance, if I asked you to clarify what you meant somewhere, you would give me an explanation, but you wouldn&#39;t revise the story to include that information.<br><br>To be fair, I was inexperienced when I beta-read your Permission piece, and a lot of my suggestions weren&#39;t very good -- I kept trying to make your story into something it wasn&#39;t, rather than helping you make it into a better version of itself (I&#39;m sorry, and I&#39;ve learned better since then; please don&#39;t write me off as a potential beta). But often you wouldn&#39;t reply to my comments even to say that you didn&#39;t think my idea would work, or didn&#39;t see how to implement it.<br><br>I can tell you have a hard time with writing or something like that -- your posts on the Board are usually quite brief, and you have someone else help you with Wiki editing -- so maybe it&#39;s not like you to have huge, long discussions with your betas. But if you want to be a writer, you have to be able to work with someone to help you revise. And this is something you will get better at with practice, like every other skill you&#39;re working on as a writer (and every other skill, period).<br><br>--Key has struggled with taking feedback all her life, and is getting better at it</p>

        <div class="post-body">
            <p>From what I understand, you prefer clear and blunt feedback, and I will attempt to provide it. If, from your perspective, I am being vague or unclear, please tell me what you were uncertain about so that I can clarify it. If something I write below appears rude, that is not my intention.<br><br>One of my main concerns is that your expressed attitude towards constructive criticism and feedback is not the attitude expected of PPCers. Several people have provided you with critical feedback on your PPC writing, which included suggestions for improvement and often indicated that your stories had significant structural problems that required revision.<br><br>You have not (from what I can see) responded to this this concrit in the matter expected of you as a PPCer. There are (speaking generally) several possible responses to concrit we consider appropriate. (This is not written down anywhere, as far as I know. I&#39;m attempting to imprecisely write down my view of social consensus.) <br><br>The first is to <i>use</i> the feedback by making edits and improvements to the work being commented on. This is effectively obligatory for unintentional typos and other minor errors. If you use someone&#39;s concrit, it is expected that you leave a message indicating this and thanking them for their efforts. If the concrit indicates a major structural issue, and you intend to resolve this issue through heavy editing, you are expected to take your story down until you have completed your changes. As a specific point, if you are told that something is unclear from the text, responding with a clarifying comment (but not changing the story) is not sufficient.<br><br>A second option is to <i>discuss</i> and possibly disagree with the concrit. Since writing is a somewhat subjective exercise, there will be times that you will receive concrit that you do not think you should implement, or which you will otherwise disagree with. When this occurs, you should still respond to the criticism and explain (to a reasonable extent) why you disagree with it, ask for clarification, or otherwise discuss the feedback you received. <br><br>A third option, which generally applies to large-scale issues that would be difficult to resolve but that are only minor problems (such as being slightly over/under-descriptive) is to acknowledge the feedback and apply it to future work. However, this would not be a reasonable response to the comments you have received on your previous mission, which point out much more serious structural issues.<br><br>(In addition, if a response includes multiple items of criticism, you should make some response to all of them.)<br><br>The main reason for these expectations is that the PPC is a community dedicated to <i>good writing</i> and <i>improvement</i>. You are expected to engage with the feedback you receive, and to make edits and revisions even after publication. (For example, <a href="http://starshadowhall.tripod.com/ppc/rc999/02wfwd.html">in this mission, Neshomeh resolved a canon error <i>four years</i> after publication</a>.) This expectation does not generally extend to full rewrites long after the fact, although they may be advised in your case. Your apparent refusal to do this (&quot;the two linked stories are dead and I won&#39;t be working on them&quot;) is not an expected response. (If this was a highly abbreviated way to withdraw those stories from the PPC universe, please indicate that you are doing this.) Similarly, replying to concrit by simply indicating you have read it is not a correct response.<br><br>There have also been concerns about your interactions with your beta readers. In general, you are expected to engage with your betas&#39; feedback like you would with concrit. You are also expected not to publish work until you have resolved your betas&#39; concerns (or reached a state of mutual reasonable disagreement). Not doing this indicates an apparent lack of interest in cultivating good writing skills on your part, which is something I am concerned about.<br><br>Furthermore, you have displayed (though you seem to not be doing this as much recently) a pattern of posting on the Board for a day or two and then disappearing for a long period of time. While hiatuses are a normal part of PPC life, you should at least keep an eye on your own threads, and respond to those who reply to you as appropriate. This is especially the case with mission and interlude threads. Posting a mission and then (from out perspective) ignoring the replies is not the behavior we want you to exhibit. It shows that you are not acting as a member of the PPC community, and the PPC is fundamentally a community that writes in a shared universe, not a shared universe with an attached community.<br><br>There are no <i>formal</i> consequences if you keep acting this way. However, there are likely to be <i>informal</i> social consequences. That is, people will become annoyed with you because you are not respecting community norms. You may begin finding it more difficult to find beta readers if you continue to develop a reputation as being difficult to work with. Your work may go unread. You may stop receiving feedback because people will not want to waste their time giving concrit that will not be applied. This is not inevitable, and will (almost certainly) not occur if you change your behavior to better align with our expectations.<br><br>I hope that my attempt at writing down the unspoken conventions of the PPC will help you work with us better, and I look forward to reading your future writing.<br><br>- Tomash</p>

            <p>My post was intended to clearly outline what &quot;trying harder&quot; would look like, and what you were expected to do. I am confused by why you believed the subject line you used was a good response to my post, especially since it comes across as angry shouting.<br><br>I think one significant action you can take that will make it clear you intend to reform and try harder to act appropriately is to go back to your old missions and revise them, taking into account the feedback and concrit you have received. This will also significantly improve your reputation within the PPC. (If you feel that you are unable to revise your previous work, unpublishing it is a valid alternative solution.)<br><br>To put it another way, &quot;next time&quot; isn&#39;t quite enough. We&#39;d like to see &quot;this time&quot; as well, since it is possible.<br><br>Tomash</p>

            <p>What Tomash is saying is genuine constructive criticism, and you are reacting to it with hostility, shouting (capslock subject lines, for example), and ignoring the gist of what he&#39;s trying to tell you.<br><br>If you feel constructive criticism is an attack, then why are you writing for the PPC, where we&#39;re pretty much <i>based</i> on giving and receiving concrit for our writings?<br><br>You have a responsibility to make sure your writings are up to snuff. Not just because it&#39;s general common sense, but it&#39;s also included in the Constitution. Section 5, Article 24 specifically mentions PPCers writing bad fanfiction, but the point of Permission is to check and make sure writers for our shared universe are contributing quality pieces, which you are not only failing to do, but are also refusing to improve upon. <br><br>Yes, you say you&#39;ll try better next time, but when your words say you don&#39;t care about improving your past work (&quot;both of the two linked sotires are dead and I won&#39;t be working on them.&quot;) and then ignore what Tomash says save for shouting at him, it&#39;s a little concerning to us.<br><br>If this is feeling like an attack to you, may I suggest you take some time and think about why we&#39;re telling you this? We want to see you improve as a writer, but we can&#39;t do that if you don&#39;t make an effort to do so.<br></p>

We&#39;d like to help you improve, it&#39;s just difficult to do so if you&#39;ve already run away. <br><br>For example, when someone points out issues in the mission, it&#39;s usually a good idea to take their advice under consideration, then either alter the text or give specific reasons why that doesn&#39;t work for your mission.</p>

            <p>As usual, I&#39;m looking for SpaG, flow, and any other form of advice which could cross the mind of the tentative beta-reader. Oh, and don&#39;t be afraid to be blunt or something else in your critics. Gloves-off critic is a good thing, no matter how hard it is to take.<br><br>Now, since it only covers up the very first days of the plot, no canon knowledge is really needed, although I reference sometimes things happening later in the story (nothing too spoilery.
