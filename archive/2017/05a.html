            <p>In general, paging people on the Board isn&#39;t recommended, though it isn&#39;t strictly forbidden; I&#39;d honestly see it as a last resort, especially since most of the people I&#39;ve paged via e-mail have responded in a timely manner. I&#39;m not outright against paging, but it&#39;s usually best reserved for a very big reason - otherwise your small question could accidentally push something way more important off the front page.<br><br>This is in no ill will to you - I&#39;ve made this mistake a few times before in the past - but I&#39;d recommend using e-mail to ask questions to specific people if you know their e-mail address. Works just as well, but doesn&#39;t take up Board space. ^_~</p>

            <p>I have undiagnosed autism, diagnosed emotional dysregulation, possible ADD, and a diagnoses that keeps flipping between anxiety and depression.  I also get weird attacks where I have absolutely no ability to tell the difference between a good idea and a bad one and I don’t even realize that my judgement is impaired; if the pattern holds, it shouldn’t happen again for a couple of years.<br><br>I’m a lot like Julia on Sesame Street.  There is nothing to overcome, this is just who I am.<br><br>I absolutely do not get connotation.  There are positive words and negative words, but I cannot tell the difference.  I find it hard to articulate what’s in my head.  I see my own writing and judge that the tone is level.  Sometimes I read what you’re saying and might pick up condensation where there is none, or completely miss an angry subtext.  Sometimes I don’t understand things right away.  I tried parroting so that I wouldn’t use any “bad words” but I’ll stop because someone thinks I’m mocking.<br><br>I was taught never to say “you’re wrong” or “you hurt me” and I have no clue on how to articulate it tactfully.  It’s common for aspies to say something rude or insulting while meaning to be nice.  I have never done anything out of malice.  In good faith, I ignore a lot of perceived provocations.  By the time I mention not liking something, I’m pretty close to a meltdown.  If you see lashing out, it’s either unarticulated pain or something completely innocuous that’s perceived with the wrong intent.  There is also a bit of anxiety whenever I say, “I don’t like this.”  I get flashbacks to bullies who would then do it more because I’ve told them how to get a reaction.<br><br>I apologize for trying to talk about how I’m feeling.  I didn’t talk to them; this is a new mistake.  I don’t have a stim that can soothe it.  I have no choice but to bottle up my emotions until I start flailing and screaming at the furniture.<br><br>If not saying anything is a god-given right, then why do I keep getting attacked for “maliciously ignoring” people?<br><br>Even if I had been in a reasonable state of mind that night, I thought that what I did was not necessarily good, but perfectly acceptable.  After all, it was done to me for what felt like months and it didn’t feel like ignoring it or saying how I felt about it was doing anything.  No one said anything about it.  I dreaded coming here, knowing that you would push me closer to a meltdown.  Maybe if I had used the word “stop” you would have.  <br><br>I’ll be going away for a while.</p>

            <p>First, it&#39;s brave of you to be so candid about your mental health issues. Talking about stuff like that really isn&#39;t easy - it took me several goes to really open up about my anger issues and paranoia on the Board - so you should be praised for bringing it up. However, as others have told me and as I will now tell you, it does not excuse poor behaviour, nor does it free you from the responsibility to take the consequences of your actions. Regardless of whether or not you were taught to say &quot;you hurt me&quot;, it is imperative that you do better in recognizing when other people are saying it.<br><br>With this in mind, let&#39;s talk about some of what you&#39;ve said.<br><br>&quot;<i>If not saying anything is a god-given right, then why do I keep getting attacked for “maliciously ignoring” people?</i>&quot;<br><br>Beta readers give their time of their own volition, and the whole point of having them is to talk about your work with them and discuss what can be improved. You did not do this with Ix and Des and Aegis. You just... didn&#39;t. From what I&#39;ve gathered, you dismissed their points out of hand when you weren&#39;t getting extremely defensive about such points being made in the first place. This is Not Okay. That is not how you respond to constructive criticism of the sort that is given by beta readers.<br><br>Additionally, while I&#39;m certain this was not your intent, your phrasing here makes you sound nothing so much as <i>whiny</i>. Ix was not being malicious; they simply did not want to talk to you, and this desire not to talk to you was compounded by repeated attempts to force yourself into a conversation with them. I understand just how hard the question &quot;Why won&#39;t Person X talk to me?&quot; can hurl itself at the walls of one&#39;s skull, but just as you have the right to privacy and the right to choose with whom you associate, so do they.<br><br>I&#39;m going to say the following very bluntly, and I apologise if doing so causes you any distress; it is merely meant as instructional and in no way is it a rebuke. Ahem:<br><br>Nobody owes you their time. You owe nobody your time. That&#39;s how this whole song and dance called human interaction <i>works</i>.<br><br>Let&#39;s take an example from your own experiences as mentioned in this post - an extreme one, admittedly, but the story beats line up, for want of a better term. If one of the bullies from your schooldays showed up in your social media/IRC channel/pigeon fanciers&#39; association AGM or whathaveyou and started demanding that you speak with them, you would be well within your rights to tell them where they could stick it, yes?<br><br>The same applies to other people. It always has and it always will. Everyone has a choice whether or not to engage with people, and that choice has to be respected. You are not owed interactions with Ix because you interacted before any more than you can nick a tenner off your best friend because they gave you a tenner in 2006.<br><br>So no, what you did was not &quot;perfectly acceptable&quot;, nor was it good. What you did was harass someone, demand positive attention from them, and not accept it when they told you no. These behaviours are in breach of the Constitution and you should be brought up on it. However, more than that, you should be given the opportunity to improve and excel. I urge you to take it.<br><br>I didn&#39;t, back in the day.<br><br>Don&#39;t be like I used to be.</p>

            <p>First, to the extent that Bramandin&#39;s apology is directed to the community at large, I&#39;m willing to consider it sincere, unless Bram&#39;s future actions disprove this. I, and everyone else here, have no power to accept or reject Bramandin&#39;s apologies to Iximaz; that power lies with her alone.<br> <br>Bramandin, I am concerned by some aspects of your apology, which indicate that you have some significant misunderstandings of the norms of neurotypical social interaction. This is entirely understandable, and I do not blame you for it. However, as a fellow aspie, I would like to disagree with your assertion that &quot;There is nothing to overcome, this is just who I am.&quot; As others have pointed out, you cannot use who you are as a shield from consequences. Since who you are causes you to have difficulties interacting with others appropriately, if you want to interact with people, you must <i>manage</i> your mental illnesses by learning to interact appropriately with others. This is not going to be quick or easy, and you will almost certainly make mistakes along the way. Despite this, I am confident that you can learn like I did and continue to do. (If you, at some point, want me to try and help you  understand something, my email and Discord are open.)<br> <br>Now, to the community:<br> <br>The current consensus resolution appears to be &quot;We accept Bramandin&#39;s apology. If Bramandin tries to get Iximaz&#39;s attention again, we will have a full discussion and vote during which we will be very likely to impose consequences.&quot;. I claim this is insufficient, given our (actual or perceived) tendency to abandon discussions and ignore complaints, which make it [appear to be] the case that no consequences will actually be imposed for future offenses.<br> <br>Therefore, I propose that we make our attitude towards Bramandin&#39;s possible future offenses clearer and more concrete for both Iximaz and Bramandin&#39;s benefit, as well as our own.<br> <br>To provide that clarity, I again propose that, if Bramandin contacts Iximaz again, she (Bramandin) shall automatically receive a ban of not less than three months (which will be extendable at the time of the offense), and that this potential automatic ban remain over Bram&#39;s head for at least two years.<br> <br>I believe that the imposition of specific future consequences for a clearly-defined set of future acts is, in this case, necessary, despite the apologies that have been offered. This is due to the severe and repeated nature of the harassment in question, and the fact that it remains unclear to what extent Bram understands (or will in the future understand) the inappropriateness of her actions. I also believe that this consequence would help Bram guide her actions in the future.<br> <br>In order to make our consensus about how we will act more concrete, I ask everyone who agrees with my proposal (or something similar, or even something more severe) to explicitly indicate this (&quot;+1 (nm)&quot; is fine), and similarly for disagreements.<br> <br>- Tomash<br><br>(I agree with this; I&#39;d like to see the &quot;or else&quot; defined.)</p>

            <p>&quot;I agree that we should be considerate of Bram&#39;s mental illness, just as we have been considerate of so many others over the years.<br><br>However, continuing to harass someone after being clearly informed that the specific things you were doing were unacceptable and needed to stop is not something that should be completely swept under the rug.<br><br>Therefore, I propose as follows:<br><br>Bramandin may not attempt to speak to or otherwise interact with Iximaz again.

            <p>There&#39;s a search bar on the top left of the main Board page. It doesn&#39;t show up on the replying pages or if you&#39;ve clicked on an individual post. I don&#39;t know of a way to search and get only posts by a specific user, but if you search the name of the person you will get both posts by them and posts that mention them. It&#39;s frequently more helpful, as Aegis somewhat indirectly said, to search for a key word that you think appeared in the posts (or the titles of the posts) you&#39;re looking for (such as &quot;Kelly&quot; or &quot;Purim RP&quot; or &quot;Death Star&quot;). Keep them relatively short and you should have success.<br><br>There may be a way to use Google search to get posts by a specific user, but I don&#39;t know what it is. In addition, there are the Board archives: if you open those and use the Find function (ctrl+F on PC, not sure if it changes for Mac but I&#39;d expect it to be command+F if it is different), you should be able to find everything on the page. The Board archives (or this set of them--I think there&#39;s another one that looks a lot like the T-Board? I&#39;ve lost track of the link, though) <a href="http://huinesoron.webs.com/PPC/BoardArchive.htm">can be found here</a>. They currently go through 2016, going by what&#39;s on the page. There&#39;s also <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fwMnwJ0W7WCDVWpAlFfbvEjodfEn4BHHsgbfoS-Um1g/pub">a page on how to use them</a>, which may be helpful--they&#39;re basically giant Excel files, and can be a bit difficult to navigate.<br><br>Hope that helps.<br><br>~Zing</p>

            <p>You&#39;ll be pleasantly surprised, if the evidence is what you’re looking for. I know I would’ve been if I’d wanted to see the morass I found, or, rather, that Tomash pointed me to so I could actually look at what had happened in the past.<br><br><a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=294056;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">Permission thread from April of last year.</a><br>Your main problem here is that you seem to offer excuses for why other people&#39;s criticism isn&#39;t valid. I&#39;m willing to accept that you didn&#39;t understand where they were coming from, but when your writing necessitates an entire thread of discussion regarding what you were thinking, there&#39;s usually a problem in your writing. <br><br>Also, you accuse both Iximaz and Desdendelle of yelling at you for “taking the prompts literally?” I think they were trying to explain that prompts don’t necessarily dictate the story to a T unless you want them to, but it looks like Huinesoron covered that. <br><br><a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=296527;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">Permission thread from May of last year.</a><br><br>Again, what I&#39;m seeing from you isn&#39;t a request for a clarification, but, eventually, repeated protestations that you&#39;re incapable of doing what the community asks of you because of extenuating circumstances. These circumstances are understandable, but you can&#39;t change the rules for permission or writing missions when one person is inconvenienced by their circumstances. The shared universe has a few standards, and if you can&#39;t meet them, either suggest to us a workaround or find a way to meet them. A poor working environment does not excuse publishing poor writing. It seems to me like Des tried to explain this to you, and you either didn&#39;t understand or ignored him. <br><br>The only thing I can say for you here is that you didn’t openly harass anyone that time, from what I’ve seen. <br><br><a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=290748;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">February. Also of last year..</a><br><br>I&#39;d like to give you credit for understanding what went wrong what I believe is the first time, but from what I&#39;ve seen, you&#39;ve repeated this behavior, so let&#39;s take the chance to clarify. In this and other threads, you have--within the same thread--requested that Iximaz not talk to you because she makes you uncomfortable, and give you a detailed explanation of what you&#39;ve done wrong. Several times, you demonstrate a belligerent and downright hostile attitude toward those offering to explain to you what you&#39;ve done wrong. <br><br>Rather than listen to Iximaz when she told you that you were being rude, you were openly hostile, as explained by Iximaz in <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=290913;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">this post.</a> You responded to it with a comment that implied the entire PPC was somehow biased against you because of a mental disorder, when I’ve dug through these records and watched us give you every possible chance. <br><br>And watched you snap at them for it. <br><br>And then there’s<a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=305042;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board;pagemark=25"> this. Just. . .  this.</a><br><br>This is your explanation for why Iximaz doesn&#39;t have to explain anything to you. Tomash has done so. Recently. Iximaz has done so--the whole Board has done so--repeatedly. In this post, Tomash very clearly, calmly, concisely—and many other adjectives ending in -ly that probably break the alliterative chain— lays out exactly what our problems are with your behaviors. <br><br>And you busted out caps lock on him for it, shouting that somehow the PPC wasn’t being fair to you. <br><br>To the PPC at large: In light of all of these past actions, I stand in favor of the immediate ban of Bramandin. Their apologies have been rendered meaningless by their continued wrongdoing in the face of multiple, clearly stated explanations of exactly what was wrong with what they were doing. <br><br>Bramandin is harassing Iximaz, a fellow member of the PPC, for an explanation, when they’ve plainly been given one several times. They’re demanding an apology from someone who tried being considerate, and, in the face of someone who obstinately refuses to actually listen, chose to step away from the conversation.<br><br>They provide excuses for their poor work, rather than improving said work’s quality, and either run away from concrit or spew out vitriolic caps lock for it, apparently randomly demanding explanations from those who have made it absolutely clear that they no longer wish to engage with Bramandin--which is actually reasonable, considering her reactions to everyone who has done so.<br><br>I think Bramandin is a hostile, toxic PPC member, and I don&#39;t think she should be allowed to continue.</p>

            <p>It looks an awful lot like you are saying Bramandin should be banned, in part, for being very bad at taking concrit, and for feeling - let&#39;s break out that word again - <i>harassed</i> when people keep trying to hit her with the same point that she either disagrees with or doesn&#39;t understand. I don&#39;t think that is reasonable.<br><br>I do not feel that, by and large, anyone has harassed or attacked Bramandin. I won&#39;t rule out there being individual posts which do so, but as a rule people have tried to deal with her fairly. Lots of people have gotten frustrated in doing so, per Hieronymus&#39; context post, but that has not become the kind of attack she keeps describing it as.<br><br>However, I also am not aware of Bramandin harassing anyone prior to the incident that sparked this thread. She has been very bad at taking concrit, yes. She has lashed out when she feels attacked, yes. But this is the first time I am aware of that she engaged in actual harassment of another person.<br><br>Unless I am wrong - unless there is something that does fit that description - I feel the appropriate response is to make it clear what the problem is (which has been done by this thread), make it clear that any <i>further</i> incidents may result in a ban, and give Bramandin one last chance to prove that she can overcome her unspecified mental health issue and function as a member of this community.<br><br>As Hieronymus said: when Iximaz&#39;s mental health issue led to her flaming the entire PPC, we took that into consideration in our response. This is a very different situation - Bramandin&#39;s condition appears to be continuous, where Iximaz&#39;s breakdowns are only occasional - but we should have that same consideration.<br><br>One more chance. We gave it to Iximaz when she went off her meds, we gave it to July when she snapped after a 20-hour military shift, we give it to Scapegrace every time her self-control lets her down. Give it to Bramandin too. Let her have one last opportunity to surprise us all.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Once again, I should clarify I know almost nothing about what happened originally between Bram and Ixi, back when the latter and Des agreed to be the former&#39;s Permission (I think) betas. From all the info I have, whatever happened made Iximaz dislike Bram greatly, to a point that she didn&#39;t want to interact with her. That&#39;s my view on the past.<br><br>I will agree with you, hS, that this is <i>de facto</i> Bram&#39;s first major offence. Yes, not taking concrit well shouldn&#39;t be considered a reason behind banishment. At the very best, it would result in a &#39;social ban&#39; - people would simply deny Bram&#39;s request, knowing how she deals with critique.<br><br>However, I believe this incident shouldn&#39;t be resolved without punishment. Yes, second chance could probably be involved, but during the course of this thread Bram remained unapologetic, made a mockery out of every helpful and not violent response, and failed to understand Iximaz&#39;s wishes and personal space, continuously pushing her into conversation, then - when it became obvious nobody will take her side in this - she tried to spark the conflict in Discord. Bram doesn&#39;t feel in the slightest that she&#39;s done something wrong (and I&#39;m not talking about the past incident with Des &amp; Ix, but the current one). Instead, she feels like the victim. The only reason I&#39;m not calling for Bram&#39;s ban is because I&#39;ve done the exact same thing.<br><br>So here&#39;s my solution to the whole matter:<br><br>1. Somebody with full info behind the past incident talks it over to Bram, in private, making sure she understands why she did what she did.<br><br>2.

            <p>A lot of people in this thread have been requiring apologies from one or more parties. I would like to draw some attention to article five: <i>Apologies for making a mistake, and for being unclear, are recommended, but should not be demanded.</i><br><br>What good is a forced apology, anyway? Does it really feel good to hear an apology that&#39;s being made because the other party <i>has to</i> make it? What&#39;s it supposed to accomplish?<br><br>--Key</p>

            <p>If you read the full Article five, the mistake in question would be caused by a misunderstanding (or a cultural dissonance). &quot;Should not be demanded&quot; may not be applicable if something far more serious than a common misunderstanding happened, and the worth of a sincere apology that had been demanded may be that it demonstrates the result of a successful learning process. Of course, I cannot speak for people who actually demanded something; that’s just my guess of what’s going on.  <br><br>HG</p>

            <p>In all of those examples you listed, you know what the difference was? An apology. Not continued escalation after repeated tellings to step back and attempted anonymous trolling.

            <p>I see that I did not explicitly state that functioning as a member of this community would include making amends for this incident.

It&#39;s possible she&#39;s having a mentally messed-up day, and will apologise or step it back tomorrow. As you said recently, we extended that courtesy to you, so in fairness we shouls give newer people the same chance.<br><br>In the event that she either carries on or tries to ignore it, I thibk it would be appropriate to consider discipliniary actions.

            <p>You are trying to force Iximaz to talk to you. You are treating Iximaz&#39;s attention as rightfully yours. It is not.

If Iximaz does not want to talk to you, you do not have the right to demand that she does.<br><br>You have repeatedly accused Iximaz of being rude. Looking back at the chat log, it seems that you view saying she does not want to talk to you as rudeness. That view is not correct. Iximaz&#39;s response to you in the Discord was not rude.<br><br>You, on the other hand, have directly and repeatedly attacked Iximaz in this thread. Iximaz has not said a word about why she does not want to talk to you; you have posted <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=307968;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">several paragraphs</a> attacking Iximaz. Iximaz has called you on your disrespect; you have repeatedly called her rude and, in this post, mean.<br><br>You have attacked Iximaz; Iximaz has not attacked you.

You have tried to <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=307975;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">manipulate the rules to allow you to attack Iximaz without repercussion</a>; Iximaz has, again, just asked you to stop talking to her.<br><br>Step back.

            <p>I was too shy to speak up before, but when Iximaz and Desdendell were trying to “help” me with my characters, all they did was scream at me and make me feel stupid for asking for help.  Then they told July that I had given them trouble.  Ix even said that I was being snippy when I was just telling her that I already knew that.  I’m pretty sure that one of them started the rumor that I was difficult to work with.<br><br>Iximaz took other jabs at me.  Saying I disregarded their advice and then not being able to say what that advice was.  The irritating part is when Iximaz would say something like ‘I’m not commenting on this because I can’t trust myself to be impartial.’<br><br>I was just trying to open communication with Iximaz, but they wouldn’t even clarify if ‘I don’t want to talk to you’ meant “I don’t feel like talking to anyone right now” or “go die in a fire you piece of garbage.”  I’m inclined to believe the latter and it’s rude.  The mediator couldn’t even give a straight answer.</p>

Instead, let me just run through your last sentence:<br><br><br>&quot;<i>I was just trying to open communication with Iximaz</i>&quot;<br><br>Which she made clear that she wishes not to participate in.

Uncomfortable enough to not wanting to talk things over. And yet, you keep on pushing, and pushing, and pushing, when she made more than enough claims that she doesn&#39;t want to make amends with you. At the very best, when her negative emotions are over, she will ignore you and both of you can live their separate paths, not sparking any more conflicts.<br><br>Please, get this finally into your head: You are not on Iximaz&#39;s good list. And after this little show, you will never be. Nothing you can do about it.<br><br>This also ends my hypocrisy. </p>

            <p>Because either you&#39;re still not getting it, or decided now to play coy and make a mockery of us trying to explain it to you.<br><br>Once upon a time, you did something that felt wrong for Iximaz. Whatever you did, and whether or not it was brought up by the community (and I believe it was, since I vaguely recall there being a discussion), is not the current concern. We&#39;re not discussing your actions in the past, we&#39;re not discussing what it was that made Iximaz dislike you. We&#39;re not looking for explanation of your actions from the past.<br><br>Time has passed, emotions died down, but still remained. You ask Iximaz whether or not you can talk about it (which, at this point is evident to me that would end badly, since you clearly still have no idea what you did). She said &quot;I&#39;d rather you not&quot;, which is not a vague information of &#39;maybe we can talk&#39;. It&#39;s a signal that says, &quot;Please, leave me be. I don&#39;t want to have the whole matter blow up again.&quot; And yet, instead of getting that signal, you continue to ask her for conversation she doesn&#39;t want to attend. What in this whole exchange is so unclear?<br><br>I really hope you&#39;re gonna get it this time, and I didn&#39;t spend the last half an hour trying to be as clear and polite as possible. <br><br>But if you&#39;re going to once again mock this reply, and continue making all of this a joke, then so help me God in Heavens I give up on trying to help you.</p>

            <p>... I wasn&#39;t a) saying that not talking to people is connected to the Discord, b) saying that not talking to people is something that shouldn&#39;t happen, or c) saying that outright telling someone you don&#39;t want to talk to them is against the rules.<br><br>Can someone clarify the timeline here? There&#39;s a half-hour gap between Bramandin&#39;s first comment and Iximaz&#39;s reply; was there other (unrelated) conversation in there, or just a silent Discord? And did Bramandin do or say anything in the 11-odd hours you jump over at the end of the transcript?

            <p>There was nothing in the break in the first quote; discord was silent for half an hour, as sometimes happens in the off hours. Ix&#39;s response was the immediate first reply, and conventionally appropriate for picking up a conversation that&#39;s gone quiet.<br><br>And as others have said, Bram participated in a few unrelated conversations in the hours before the final exchange, but the last comment was completely out of the blue.

            <p>Thanks for extending me the opportunity to clarify. <br><br>In this case, it&#39;s the fact that Matt Cipher&#39;s post was a general message, which, to me—and I think to Iximaz, though obviously I can&#39;t speak for her—is an important distinction. <br><br>I didn&#39;t see Matt Cipher as specifically addressing JulyFlame, but as addressing the females of the PPC, of which JulyFlame is a member. <br><br>I&#39;d like to think that if a similar situation occurred, wherein Bramandin made a post similar to Matt Cipher&#39;s which included Iximaz&#39;s, we&#39;d have had the same conversation with Ix if she&#39;d decided to take the issue personally. <br><br>In this case, Bramandin demanded an explanation from Iximaz despite repeated requests from Iximaz not to do so. <br><br>I thought it was wrong when Matt Cipher pursued JulyFlame for an explanation. The confusion, I think, arises from the fact that I also thought JulyFlame was wrong for taking an expression of goodwill that happened to include her as a personal attack.<br><br>In this case, Bramandin isn&#39;t extending goodwill toward anyone of the gender Ix is a member of, but— however unintentionally —hounding Ix for an explanation of a perceived negative opinion, real or imagined, and in the face of very clear requests to stop. To go back to the example of JulyFlame and Matt Cipher, Bramandin is doing something very similar to Iximaz, and the prevailing opinion was that it was wrong then. I think it still is. <br><br>--Aegis, hoping that cleared things up slightly more than it muddied them. </p>

            <p>Part of the reason I asked is that I have no idea what the general consensus was when (as you put it) &quot;Matt Cipher pursued JulyFlame for an explanation&quot;. My memories of that incident are mostly from emails, so I don&#39;t recall what happened on the Board (and don&#39;t know what was said on the Discord).<br><br>As I&#39;ve just said to Iximaz, I think Bramandin is seriously in the wrong here. I&#39;m not sure what they should be required to do, since in the previous incident, JulyFlame specifically and emphatically didn&#39;t want to hear <i>anything</i> from Matt Cipher, including apologies - so the instinctive &quot;Bramandin needs to apologise now!&quot; reaction may be a misfire.<br><br>At the very least, they need to commit to not talking to Iximaz.<br><br>hS</p>

The young officer&#39;s headshake just confirms it.<br><br>&quot;Very well,&quot; she says, &quot;then we&#39;ll have to keep them busy here. Comms - make sure the skipper&#39;s been notified. We&#39;ve got a fight ahead of us.</i><br><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/PPC%20Games/Triplanetary/Triplanetary0.png"><br><br>Welcome, collective captain, to the burden of command! You&#39;ve just entered the system with your single (gold) ship, and have discovered that it is in enemy (red) hands. Your number two priority is to make it back across the hyper limit (blue line) and jump to hyperspace, getting the word out.<br><br>Unfortunately, your number <i>one</i> priority is the unarmed and unarmoured convoy coming in behind you. They will arrive at your current location in five turns, which also happens to be the time it will take you to make it back over the limit and hyper out. You can&#39;t send a message to them while they&#39;re in hyperspace, so their only hope is if you can draw the enemy ships off and give them time to escape - another five turns after they cross the limit.<br><br>The hex grid is your tactical plot. It shows your ship (in gold), and your current vector - ie, where you will end up if you don&#39;t make any changes to your heading this turn. It also displays any other ships or missiles you can currently see - in this case, two enemy vessels. Your Tactical Officer has helpfully displayed the enemy&#39;s current vector, and the volume of space they could end their next turn in if they maneuver. The grid extends indefinitely in all directions, but nothing has been detected beyond the volume of space shown.<br><br>Your ship has several critical systems you should familiarise yourself with:<br><br>a) Your <b>gravitic wedge</b> is both your drive and your shielding. While it is raised, your ship has an acceleration of <b>two</b>. That means that in each turn, you can change the endpoint of your gold vector by up to two hexes. This shift can be forwards (accelerating), backwards (decelerating), or to the side (turning); your Tactical Officer has helpfully displayed the area you can reach on your plot. Your ship will follow the arrow as it exists <b>after</b> you maneuver, and that will be its new vector next turn. The enemy ships, and the convoy, have the same two-unit acceleration; the ring around your ship&#39;s icon indicates a raised wedge.<br><br>At the <b>end</b> of each turn, you may choose to lower the wedge, or raise it if it is already down. This takes effect immediately.<br><br>c) Your <b>sensors</b> detect gravitic wedges. A raised wedge can be detected at any distance, in real-time. A lowered wedge is invisible at long range - you can only detect it three hexes away. The enemy, and the convoy, have weaker sensors than you - they can only spot a lowered wedge at two hexes. So lowering your wedge lets you enter &#39;stealth mode&#39; - but means you can&#39;t use it to maneuver, and you lose its protection against attacks.<br><br>c) Your <b>thrusters</b> are used for maneuvering when the wedge is lowered. They are very weak - they grant you an acceleration of <b>one</b>, but you can only use this on <b>alternate turns</b>. They are non-gravitic, so cannot be seen on sensors; that means that you (or the enemy) can never know precisely where a ship is once its wedge is down. The enemy, and the convoy, have the same thrusters as you.<br><br>d) Your <b>weapons</b> come in two kinds. <b>Lasers</b> are the simplest: they&#39;re instantaneous weapons which can hit any hex directly adjacent to your ship. You can fire one laser per turn. Your <b>missiles</b> are essentially tiny starships: they have an onboard acceleration capacity of <b>ten</b>, which they can split up however they like: they can spend it all in a single massive burst, spread it out to maneuver over twelve turns, or anything in between. You can fire one missile per turn.<br><br>Enemy lasers are identical to your own. Their missiles only have an acceleration capacity of <b>eight</b>. The convoy is unarmed. Needless to say, firing missiles with their drives online reveals your exact location even with your wedge lowered, though not your vector.<br><br>If a missile or laser shot enters a hex containing a ship, it has a chance to do damage. We&#39;ll cover that if/when it comes up.<br><br>All rules apply to all ships on the field - the enemy are flying under the same conditions as you. Their communications are also slow enough that they have to maneuver before they know what their colleagues are doing - they can&#39;t rely on someone else catching you. Turns are simultaneous (meaning in practice that I&#39;ve already plotted the enemy&#39;s first move).<br><br>The order of actions on your turn are:<br><br>1. Launch missiles and/or fire lasers. These will move simultaneously with you, at the end of the turn.<br>1b. Adjust the acceleration of your previously-fired missiles.<br>2. Use your wedge or thrusters to accelerate, or choose to repair a system instead. If you <b>start</b> your turn outside the hyper limit (blue line), you may hyper out.<br>3. Decide whether to raise or lower the wedge.<br>4. Commit. All ships will fire weapons, and laser hits will be resolved. All ships and weapons will move. All missile hits will be resolved. Then wedge raise/lower commands will be resolved.<br><br>Anyone can take the captain&#39;s role for each turn; please don&#39;t hog it, but let other people have a turn if they want it! Feel free to write a snippet of narrative to go with your orders; I&#39;ve deliberately left the bridge crew (and ship) unnamed and undefined to let you fill in the details. Probably the easiest way to describe your actions is to draw arrows on the tactical plot - you can upload to <a href="http://imgur.com/">Imgur</a> without an account, as an example, and I&#39;m sure there&#39;s others.<br><br>And remember: priority 1 is giving the convoy ten turns to get in and escape again. Priority 2 is getting out alive.<br><br>hS<br><br>(The setting is adapted from David Weber&#39;s <i>Honor Harrington</i> books. The game design is modified from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triplanetary">Triplanetary</a>. Ask if I haven&#39;t made sense.)</p>

            <p>&#39;This&#39; being both, y&#39;know, this, and a couple of other game threads I&#39;ve made (&quot;Congratulations, you&#39;re falling into [canon]&quot;, Gallifreyan Scrabble, and... something else? I forget).<br><br>1/ PPCers like games like this, weird one-of-a-kind threads.<br><br>2/ The more complicated things are, the fewer people will get involved. There were far more responses to the canon game than this one, with its hex grid and all.<br><br>3/ Multiple-choice is good. Multiple choice with &#39;or anything you like&#39; is better.<br><br>4/ Anything which runs longer than ten turns/a week is liable to go unfinished. It&#39;s deep enough that new people don&#39;t feel like they can jump in, the people who&#39;ve already taken part feel like they&#39;ve explored the options enough, and I start to get tired, introducing more lag.<br><br>Which is all fine! It&#39;s good information to carry through to the next game, whenever I get an inspiration. It does mean it&#39;s unlikely we&#39;ll ever play PPC Cluedo on the Board, or PPC Munchkin, but given that it&#39;s been years since I had the idea to run a Cluedo game and I&#39;ve never tried, that was inevitable anyway.<br><br>I&#39;m still happy to play this one out if people are interested; don&#39;t read this as me closing the game. :) Just thinking about the next one...<br><br>hS</p>

All four ships are damaged: most critically, Convoys Centre and South have lost their sidewalls and are flying unshielded, and a shot from Tango 3 has just taken down Convoy South&#39;s wedge entirely. They&#39;ll need to take a turn without maneuvering to repair it; whether they break formation to do so is up to you.<br><br>Convoy North has mostly escaped damage, but a freak hit has taken out her hyper generator. Until it is repaired, she can&#39;t jump out - and neither can <i>Thornbird</i>, which has also lost her thrusters (ie, she can&#39;t maneuver without her wedge up).<br><br>The enemy have taken hits of their own. Tango 2 (north) has just lost all power; this will take two turns to repair, so if you can hit her before the end of <i>next</i> turn, she&#39;ll be destroyed. Tango 1 (east) is flying without weapons, though she&#39;s sure to fix one or the other soon. Tango 3 (west) is still running smoothly.<br><br>At this point you&#39;re free to offer your own plan of whatever complexity you like. <b>However</b>, if you&#39;d prefer a simpler game, you can select from one of these options:<br><br><b>HMS Thornbird</b><br><br>A) Fire missile at Tango 2 to destroy her. Vector ENE (ie, move 1E) and fire lasers on Tango 1 if she comes into range.<br><br>B) Fire missile at Tango 3&#39;s East point. Hold position (ie, vector one hex NE) and fire lasers on Tango 1 if she comes into range. Ignore Tango 2 entirely, as she is heading out of the combat area fast.<br><br>C) Ignore Tangos 2 and 3. Fire missile at Tango 1&#39;s current endpoint and hold position (as above) to fire lasers.<br><br><b>Convoy</b><br><br>1) All ships adjust vector 1E and shut down wedges. Next turn will be spent on repairs.<br><br>2) All ships refrain from maneuvering. Convoy S spend the turn repairing the wedge. Convoy N repair hyper, Convoy C repair shields.<br><br>3) Convoy N and C accelerate along this vector (ie, adjust endpoint 2NE). Convoy S vector SE on thrusters and make for the hyper limit independently.<br><br>Since all four ships are close together, one captain can command the entire convoy if you want. Just pick a letter and a number. :)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>&quot;I would like to recommend the following course of action.  Convoy-S should break toward the Hyper Limit, and get to work repairing.  They can coast the rest of the way, bring up their wedge when the time is right, and get out.  The other Convoy ships should stay on course and begin repairs; shields and wedge are priority for all ships.<br><br>As for us, get another missile in the air heading 4 by 35 by 9 (ending at Convoy-C starting position).  Bring our other bird around to due East (ending one hex West of Convoy-C starting position).<br><br>Also, bring us about hard and burn Northeast.

            <p>-Gravitic sensors have infinite range, and no interference from intervening wedges. Active sensors aren&#39;t disableable by weapons, and have a range of 2 hexes (increased to 3 for the Manticoran warship <i>Thornbird</i>).<br><br>-Your impeller drive can adjust your vector by two hexes. Your reaction thrusters have an effective acceleration of 1/2 hex, which is modelled as only being used on alternate turns.<br><br>-All missiles are being modelled as Apollos, meaning they&#39;re controlled in real-time to the point that they always strike at an effective angle. There&#39;s a coinflip to see if they get caught by the sidewalls - I actually didn&#39;t bother with this on the one missile hit we&#39;ve had so far, because the missile came in so fast I figured Tango 1 wouldn&#39;t have time to maneuver against it. (Also I wanted to see something blow up. ^_^) But it&#39;ll be in place for every other strike.<br><br>Got a bit of a busy day today, so Turn 7 might not be up until tonight.

But they have no way of knowing you&#39;ve lowered your wedge; they think you could be anywhere in the larger hex, rather than knowing you&#39;re in the tiny one.<br><br>The fact that they know where you are means they know you paused to repair, though. That means they might guess you&#39;ll do the same again.<br><br>Remember that the number by your missiles indicates the number of hexes it can shift the end of its vector by. The central bird in your barrage eastwards is currently flying ballistic, with no remaining fuel.<br><br>Damage to the convoy is calculated slightly differently to everywhere else. They still get the coinflip, but they have no decoys or weapons. A roll of 2 or 3 will hit propulsion, while 4 or 5 hits sensors.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Your options are: a) keep going in the same direction, b) swing back towards the hyper limit, or c) try to loop away from Tango 3, back towards the <i>Thornbird</i>, and hope the bad guys overshoot.<br><br>Or anything else, of course, but it seems like people might be overwhelmed by the number of choices.<br><br>hS</p>

In neither of the proposed meters should there be three unstressed syllables in a row, and I don&#39;t think this moment in the story is dramatic enough to justify breaking the meter this way -- it causes the reader to halt and stumble for a moment, which is good if you want them to dwell on a line or phrase, but here just gets in the way of understanding this important bit of exposition. I suggest rejiggering this sentence (perhaps try replacing R2D2 and C3PO&#39;s names with something like &quot;the droids,&quot; or using their full names, or their names in a different order). If you do decide to revise this, I also advise experimenting with ending this line on an unstressed syllable to help it flow into the next line, which is a continuation of the same idea. Putting a stressed syllable here, especially with the completion of a rhyme, makes it feel very final, which is confusing since that&#39;s not actually where the thought ends at all.)<br><br>/     / u  u / u  u  /   u   u   /<br>Send unto Kenobi to beg for his help<br>(Like the first line, with the same caveat about the first syllable -- I&#39;d stress it, because the fact that the droids were sent is important information, but I suppose you don&#39;t have to.)<br><br>u   /   u    u    /  u   /    / u u    /<br>In helping their owner: bold Anakin&#39;s whelp;<br>(I&#39;m torn over whether or not to stress &quot;bold&quot; -- obviously, having it unstressed fits the meter better (however one chooses to describe said meter, there&#39;s definitely a general pattern), but. . . it doesn&#39;t sound good to me. This poem is so much of a bare-bones summary that each rare adjective seems important. Also, I don’t think a semicolon belongs here, although Djel help me if I know what punctuation you should use.)<br><br>***<br>This is approximately when I realized I ought to be doing my homework instead of nit-picking at a Star Wars poem that was probably written as a joke in less than an hour.

            <p>Probably too much math. But this is pretty dang cool! You seem to have put a ton of effort into it, and I love the prose here. If you want to, maybe develop it into an epic poem somehow? I mean, the Star Wars movies are already considered epic film, and plus, it&#39;d take time, but it&#39;d be fun. :)<br><br>-Twistey</p>

            <p>Welcome to the very first Friday Forum, a hopefully-regular thread for talking about the week we&#39;ve just had in this lovely world of ours. I&#39;ll kick it off by sharing a few news items (and my thoughts on them), and you can join in by talking about the stuff I raise, or other things that you&#39;ve noticed.<br><br>Please remember that, when it comes to the state of the world, not everyone will agree with you.

It doesn&#39;t seem to focus on the horror aspects of, say, <i>The Drawing of the Three</i> or <i>Song of Susannah</i>, which pleases me (as someone who read the Dark Tower series as fantasy and doesn&#39;t want to read anything else by Stephen King).<br><br>It looks like they&#39;re drawing mostly from <i>The Gunslinger</i> and <i>The Waste Lands</i>, though future trailers may alter that balance. It&#39;s not a straight adaptation of the books - but this is the Dark Tower series, which is rife with alternate universes. (Also, rumour says that Roland has the Horn of Eld - see <a href="http://mashable.com/2017/05/03/the-dark-tower-trailer-missing-horn-theory/#h7HHSP_xJiq0">the end of this post</a> if you don&#39;t mind spoilers on what that actually means...)<br><br><b>Silly News</b><br><br><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-39806145"><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/Friday%20Forum/FF-5-5-17b.png"></a><br>(<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-39806145">Link</a>)<br><br>Prince Philip, the Queen&#39;s husband (and Duke of Edinburgh), has stepped down from his royal duties at the age of 95. (Well, technically he&#39;s announced that he will in the autumn, at 96... whatever.) You might think that isn&#39;t particularly silly, but, uh, the BBC decided to commemorate the decision with an article on the numerous offensive &quot;quips&quot; he&#39;s made over the years (see link, above).

He <i>should</i> be thinking that he shot himself in the foot by supporting said snap election, but who knows?<br><br>Stateside, the biggest issue with Trump&#39;s replacement (per Kaitlyn) is that it simultaneously gives insurers the ability to raise premiums based on pre-existing conditions, and removes the prohibition against counting domestic violence as a pre-existing condition. So yeah, if you go into hospital after your boyfriend breaks your arm, your insurance company can ask you to prove that he wasn&#39;t already beating you before you took out your policy. For the people!<br><br>There&#39;s good news on both stories, too. UKIP - the far-right nationalist party of the UK - were absolutely hammered in the local elections, and the Trump presidency originally thought getting his bill through Congress would be easy compared to getting the Senate to accept it. Given that it only narrowly passed Congress after weeks of wrangling means there&#39;s still a long fight against it ahead.<br><br>But in general: I do not like it, Sam I Am.<br><br><b>Not News</b><br><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/Friday%20Forum/FF-5-5-17e.png"><br><br>^_^<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I wouldn&#39;t say I&#39;m the biggest Star Wars fan ever (I just enjoy the movies a lot tbh) but I did see that if you sync up this trailer and the one for <i>The Force Awakens</i> a lot of the shots/angles match up startlingly well, almost frame-for-frame. Apart from that, I couldn&#39;t really tell you what I thought. <br><br>I&#39;m excited, sure, and also that one really cool planet with the red dust was epic, but like. i don&#39;t know</p>

            <p>Things I flagged up, in no particular order:<br><br>-It looks like we get a proper Jedi training sequence, a la Dagobah. That&#39;s cool!<br><br>-This:<br><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/VaticanJedi.png"><br><br>Seems to be Luke&#39;s Jedi Academy burning down; it definitely comes over the same way as the flashback in <i>Force Awakens</i>. All those domes and spikes look kind of like church domes - think the Vatican and St. Peter&#39;s. But I can see how it draws on the old Jedi Temple.<br><br>-The <s>rebels</s> Resistance seem to love ships with bits dangling off them. Both the dust-skimmers and the capital ships in the space battle have big long dangly things.<br><br>-Is this the first printed book in the <i>Star Wars</i> films?<br><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/JournaloftheWhills.png"><br><br>It&#39;s certainly a rarity. I like the Internet theory that this is the Journal of the Whills, as referenced by <i>Rogue One</i>, and harking back to the original title of the first film.<br><br>-That one shot with the beam of light, right before the book... is that <i>wood</i>? Looks like a tangle of dead roots or something. Definitely not the cave-rocks theme we&#39;ve had from (what&#39;s Luke&#39;s planet called again?) Ahch-To so far.<br><br>-Look at the circular side-plots in this shot:<br><br><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/TimeLeia.png"><br><br>Princess Leia is a Time Lord and nothing you say will dissuade me.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Oh, man! That&#39;s pretty cool! It&#39;s a shame that the movie based on <i>The Eyes of the Dragon</i> was never finished, as I really loved that book, and I&#39;m with you in the boat of &quot;can&#39;t read any actual horror by Stephen King.&quot; &gt;u&lt; <br><br>Have you read his memoir/writing advice combo? It&#39;s pretty good, and it explains a lot about why he writes such messed-up stuff.<br><br>(Fun fact: One time, my friend shipped me with the Eyes of the Dragon version of Randall Flagg, and it escalated to the point of him having been my LO for a while.

            <p>I got an offer for a job near Cincinnati a couple of days a go - they have yet to sign the letter but I have good faith that they will soon enough - and we&#39;re currently working out whether to transition out of my current job so I can move there or to hold out until my current company transitions me to full-time. With luck though I should be able to go full-time once again soon enough, though! (Also, Voyd told me the other day that he has found a new job at a Wal-Mart at his town and that&#39;s wonderful. :D)<br><br>I&#39;m also working on the second of two interludes I have planned, and kinda waiting on the current beta for the first one (and looking for a second beta for both). Unfortunately, though, progress on this interlude has been stupidly slow, thanks to... well, I won&#39;t say, but it&#39;s a personal project I thought up this past weekend and I&#39;m keeping it under wraps until I sort out the baseline mechanics for it. But once it&#39;s ready for presentation I&#39;ll put it up on the Board for your evaluation along with both of the interludes! &#39;Twas about time I got something posted for the PPC after being out of touch with writing my agents for like what, six months? ^^;</p>

            <p>The design was really cool, sure, and I had a good laugh at the party&#39;s reaction to the fact that the &quot;Break&quot; option on one of the puzzles lasts about five seconds, but it was hard to find places to ambush enemies from, and that got annoying fast.

            <p>I didn&#39;t even know the Japanese audio was an option, actually.

            <p>I really recommend to download the audio if you can, it&#39;s more than worth it.<br><br>The real pain with Psi is the fact youu&#39;re the only able to use it for quite a while, so it can drain your SP pretty hard, and in Hard mode you just need all SPs you&#39;ve got. Still, that&#39;s one of the better ways to deal with them. (The only more efficient one I can think about is checking the fusions for weaknesses. Not necessarily nice, but it helped for me.)</p>

            <p>I&#39;m actually a bit less excited about the movie, now that I&#39;ve seen the trailer.  I know the series had issues towards the end, but I did think the early novels were going to see fairly straightforward adaptations.  There are a lot of scenes here that don&#39;t seem to have any real analogue in the first novel.  (The end sequence seems to be Roland and Jake battling the slow mutants, but that should be happening in an abandoned mine tunnel, not above ground.)  But beyond adaptational nitpicking, a lot of scenes just seem so shallowly <i>Hollywood</i>.  I especially hate Roland somehow reloading his gun by throwing them in the air, and catching them in the chambers without them moving apart from each other.  What?  And a lot of the gun fight choreography seems terribly ostentatious . . .<br><br>As a fan of King&#39;s works in a broader sense, I do hope the house where Jake finds the portal is the same one used to film the house on Niebolt Street in the upcoming <i>It</i> movie, since the two are supposed to be &quot;twins.&quot;  It will also be interesting to see if future adaptations of King&#39;s works where the man in Black appears will re-use the same actor to portray him.<br><br>—doctorlit darkles and tincts</p>

            <p>You load it ahead of time and it allows you to put bullets in a revolver more quickly.  And he has a lot of them, by the look of his belt.

            <p><a href="https://twitter.com/StephenKing/status/733244613000069120/photo/1">Stephen King on Twitter, last year</a>.<br><br>(Should I put a spoiler block in here? I feel like I should, and that I should do it with <i>Dark Tower</i>-specific text, but I can&#39;t think of any at the moment. &quot;See the TURTLE of enormous girth/On his shell he carries the whole earth&quot;, or however that went? I dunno, but the Guardians were pretty cool. Almost as cool as Maerlyn&#39;s Rainbow; in fact I really liked the whole idea that the safety of the universes relied on a bunch of stuff that actually wasn&#39;t very nice. Oh, hey, that should about do it.)<br><br>This isn&#39;t an adaptation of <i>The Gunslinger</i>. It&#39;s something far more exciting - a continuation of the story <i>after</i> book 7. It starts in the same place - &quot;The man in black fled across the desert, and the gunslinger followed&quot; - but it&#39;s under no obligation to hit the same story beats.<br><br>Will the Ka-Tet all make their appearances? I certainly hope so, and there&#39;s a certain element of fate involved there, so it seems likely (Oyoy?). But they won&#39;t go to the same places, they won&#39;t meet the same people, they may not even start out identical to how we know them, nor end the same way (in both meanings of the phrase).<br><br>I agree that it would be great to see a direct adaptation of the series (maaaaybe with fewer lobstrosities, though). But that&#39;s not what this is, and the fact that it&#39;s titled only &quot;The Dark Tower&quot; is a huge indication that it&#39;s not going to be anything like what we know. And I find that exciting.<br><br>(Also it lets them step neatly around the usual adaptation complaints of &quot;why was Roland&#39;s coat blue in this scene instead of turquoise?!?!?!&quot; - and it lets them have <i>actual suspense</i>, since we don&#39;t know what&#39;s going to happen.)<br><br>As to your Hollywood comments - maybe; I don&#39;t know. I&#39;m notoriously bad at recognising film quality. This is a first trailer, though, and they&#39;ve deliberately chosen stuff that looks Action Movie-y. I have no doubt that they could equally have made a Horror trailer, a Fantasy one, and a Quiet Talky Movie one - and I&#39;m guessing we&#39;ll see at least one of these before the film comes out.<br><br>hS, in memory of Gilead</p>

            <p>I had forgotten about that detail.  Still, though, I did think we were getting a fairly close adaptation of the earlier books, other than something I&#39;ll bring up in a bit to keep it of preview.<br><br>The face-shrouded figures in the trailer are likely can-toi, replacing the slow mutants for a species(?) that actually appears again later in the series.  They&#39;re not wearing their famous yellow coats, but I seem to recall that was implied to be their disguise when visiting Earth; they may dress more conservatively in Mid-World.  (Low men were first mentioned in the novella <i>Hearts in Atlantis</i>, but I haven&#39;t seen the movie adaptation to compare facial make-up and in fact don&#39;t even know if they appear on screen.)<br><br>Okay, so here&#39;s the NSFW paragraph.  The one scene that&#39;s basically guaranteed to be cut is when Roland comes upon Jake being molested by the lust demon, then exchanges sex with her/it for information.  I totally understand they won&#39;t want the underage actor in a scene like that, but at the same time, Roland kind of needs to encounter her/it at some point.  Maybe Jake will be absent from the scene, or maybe they&#39;re cutting Mordred out entirely?  I wouldn&#39;t mind the Man in Black remaining the primary antagonist until the end; maybe the whole Mordred subplot was one of the mistaken paths Roland took that prevented his success in the cycle we read in the novels?<br><br>I rather hope we get the flashback sequence of <i>Wizard and Glass</i>.  I found that whole novel quite serviceable as a standalone story.  I also hope the Crimson King is . . . not a garbage character?  I think that&#39;s a nice way to put that.  The scene of Stephen King&#39;s prevented death could also use a delicate touch, especially in regards to the man who hit him in real life, who has passed away since.<br><br>I do think, and suspect, the whole original ka-tet will return; as you said, there&#39;s fate there.  Callahan better show up as well, I don&#39;t want him getting cut.<br><br>Dad-a-chad?  Dum-a-dum?  Don&#39;t you dare tell me you don&#39;t  like the lobstrosities!  The lobstrosities are the absolute best thing ever.  There was a time period in high school when I went around campus saying, &quot;Did-a-chick?

            <p>Because I&#39;ve begun adding some examples of recruitment to the <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Recruit">Recruit</a> page, and a wide variety of examples is always good. Mostly what I&#39;ve added are the stories of people from World One, with the exceptions of Ranger, Surhat Roac, and Roger Walters.<br><br>The last two might be my favorite recruitment stories, because they showcase a pair of original characters finding their way to the PPC from original universes in unique ways.

            <p>(If you want to, it&#39;d be good to put it on the Wiki in case anyone comes and asks the same question.)<br><br>You&#39;re kind of confusing me... The way you worded your message seems to say that recruiting shouldn&#39;t happen period, but we both know that&#39;s not true. Do we just take the background characters? Or, wait. Maybe if it&#39;s not a Suefic but still bad enough to get someone involved (like if there&#39;s an OC stuck in the middle of an Implausible Crossover a Bad Slash, or just a fic with a really messed-up plot?) I guess that works? Would that make sense? <br><br>Or maybe if you feel as if you can do some taming of the Sue (haha, get it) and make it sufficient enough to have it work? I&#39;m guessing that last one may tie into SkarmorySilver&#39;s motives for writing EVL into the PPC, but he can jump into the conversation if he wants and clarify that.

            <p>Have a plan for them.<br><br>To the best of my recollection, I&#39;ve recruited a total of two characters from actual missions: Ithalond from <i>Celebrian</i>, and fake!Arwen/Hypatia from <i>Empire State of Mind</i>. Ithalond I rescued because Tungsten_Monk asked me to; she used him as an agent in three missions. Hypatia I picked up because she makes the perfect comedic foil for Agent Kaitlyn - she looks just like her lust object, has a name that indicates they&#39;d get on well, but is a complete scatterbrain in actuality.<br><br>There used to be a tendency (I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s still around) for people to scour every mission for a character to recruit. &quot;Congratulations,&quot; they would say, &quot;You Are In The PPC, Here Is A Daisy.&quot; And then that... was it. They didn&#39;t want the characters - they just wanted to be able to say they&#39;d recruited them. That&#39;s exactly as formulaic as &quot;every mission ends with killing something (even though we&#39;re in Floaters/Bad Slash)&quot;, or &quot;my agent uses their powersword to kill every Suvian&quot;.<br><br>I&#39;ve said recently that <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=307947;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">I have a hundred named, characterised PPC characters</a>, but the second half of that is that each and every one of them serves a purpose. Some of those purposes are very small - <a href="http://twistedskein.webs.com/EndCorrection.htm">Davea and Aphela</a> exist to be Tanfin&#39;s wife and her niece, respectively, and appear in a single story - but they do <i>have</i> a purpose. Creating or recruiting new characters just to be able to say you have is bad writing.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>And it makes it even worse when they look cool and you don&#39;t go into detail with them, because it just makes your readers rage quit so hard. Some of the fan favorites in My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic are secondary characters, because they&#39;re given great personalities (Lyra wants to be a human, there&#39;s a constant &quot;war of the music genres&quot; between Octavia and Vinyl Scratch, and Derpy is, well, derpy.)<br><br>On Scratch, I have an adoption project where I put up any OC/RP character that I&#39;ve stopped using or didn&#39;t use very much in the first place. I always ask the other users what they&#39;re going to use the character for before I let them have the character, just because I don&#39;t want the OC to go unused again by a different person. It&#39;s a good idea, really, and I think that&#39;s one of the things I&#39;m going to keep coming back to Scratch for once I&#39;ve officially left.

            <p>What are some rules for recruiting canons? I&#39;ve got someone in mind who would be of good use to you. Based on evidence from her story, she&#39;s only got a specific skill set when it would come to your operations, but I imagine that she&#39;s probably pretty good at remembering the details about stuff she&#39;s read. Also, she&#39;s from a historical fiction, and a lot of stuff from the general time period in which she &quot;lived&quot; is used in several pieces of badfic, and even original fic by authors who think their Villain OC Donut Steel is TEH EVULZ enough to pull that kind of stunt.

            <p>(Sort of a reply to everyone at once. Wow, huge bunch of replies I got.)<br><br>Isn&#39;t being able to write a character well part of writing fanfic that involves canons in general? I mean, there&#39;s even a bit of a stigma against fanfic that has an entirely OC cast or that focuses on OCs instead of canons, so you could say that if on knows the canons well enough to write them in a regular fanfic, then recruiting them might not be such a problem. Although I do kind of get that there is a sort of an in-universe reason for it (leaving canons where they belong, interfering as little as possible.) I see from the links that all the canons mentioned are either dead or clones.<br><br>...Hmm. Wait. Are these messages specifically for me as a newbie, or for anyone in general? Because I&#39;m pretty sure that although I&#39;m technically a PPCer, I won&#39;t be writing any officially PPC missions (again with my parents), and any characters I create/recruit will immediately be deemed adoptable or free-to-use. That (hypothetically only) includes the canon that I suggested earlier, or supposedly a clone thereof. Therefore, the writing of these characters, apart from initial bios, would not rest on me, but more experienced writers could give it a try.<br><br>My common sense is telling me that I should probably do some sort of OC instead, but if I did not at least somewhat consider the original thought, I would 1) have nothing to say in this post, 2) therefore be letting no one know that I read the posts and 3) miss the chance to go look for people who could be up to the challenge. <br><br>Other than the stuff in Elcalion&#39;s post and a bunch of &quot;no, just no&quot; (which I am not the biggest fan of, as I believe that concrit/discouragement/encouragement should have reasons why), nobody&#39;s given me any other reasons not to do this before y&#39;all started jumping into the discussion about examples of canons used. Sidetracked, have we? :P So I would like to hear more about it. Explain further, please. I will listen, despite how I probably sound right now.<br><br>-Twistey</p>

            <p>I like talking about this stuff. <s>Especially when I get to talk about my own characters.</s><br><br>I think your other questions have been covered, though. Elcalion said what I was going to about why recruiting canons is frowned upon, and you&#39;d already gotten that idea yourself anyway, so that&#39;s all good. {= )<br><br>I will say attempting to adopt out characters you create to other writers is probably doomed to fail, though. I think we all tend to like our own creations best, and the chances of you happening to create a character someone else happens to be looking for at that time are pretty slim. If you make PPC characters, keep them. Even if you don&#39;t write missions, you can still use them in RPs and other games.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Yep, that&#39;d probably be the best idea.<br><br>Although it might be a problem if they&#39;re Assassins/Bad Slashers/any of the action departments... I&#39;d have to write missions, I think. Right? Well, I am going to do some mission-esque things on Wattpad, though; pretty much the same except they&#39;re requested so I can say &quot;well, you asked for my opinion.&quot; That wouldn&#39;t be officially PPC, though, and I&#39;ve already got two characters (my hired mercenaries, Verse and Versailles) for those mission-esque things. So if the characters are officially agents, what would I do?<br><br>And now that I think about it, going back over <i>The Book Thief</i>&#39;s plot line, Liesel wouldn&#39;t exactly be the best for literature. Sure, she&#39;d be a pretty sharp knife for fics with *ahem, stuff from her time period* stuck in them randomly, but she didn&#39;t seem to ever have any traits for the analysis of literature or characters; reading was more just for keeping her sane. And especially because of that, we wouldn&#39;t want her dealing with fanfic that can drive someone <i>in</i>sane. I could do something similar to Liesel, though, due to the good traits I mentioned earlier.<br><br>Well, I&#39;m finding it hard to think now, since I&#39;m listening to Kraftwerk and it&#39;s hard to think when you&#39;ve got synthesizers beeping at you repeatedly, am I right?

            <p>I think character replacements can be recruited, but only should be considered in certain situations. Such as: They aren&#39;t just a Sue masquerading. They really aren&#39;t the canon. They are interesting. You have a plan for them.<br><br>I have one. I think he is the only agent that I&#39;ve posted stories with that was a fic recruit. Agent Kelok was supposed to be Todd the Wraith in the fic he is from. The author got absolutely everything about Todd wrong from basic biology to personality to speech patterns. The best I could figure the author wrote an original story and then tried to wrap a canon, any canon would do apparently, around it to get readers. I recruited him, because he was clearly not the character he was named and he was interesting as himself. The way he was described in the fic, he doesn&#39;t even look or sound all that much like the canon character. He only existed to give the Sue what she wanted, and wasn&#39;t a Stu himself. The real canon had been shoved into a plot hole. <br><br>I never tried writing him as Todd the Wraith. He just wasn&#39;t Todd and never had been. Any memories he has that should belong to Todd are hazy at best, like remembering something someone told you about that you then imagined yourself doing. He had a basic personality from the fic (one that was diametrically opposed to the canon&#39;s), but not much actual experience. Most of his real memories are as a PPC agent. </p>

            <p>(Wow, I&#39;ve been thinking way too far ahead to somewhere past the end of the animated series I mentioned in the Permission talk page and my introductory thread.)<br><br>Would it be acceptable if a character replacement got caught in the debris of a Sue&#39;s assassination and suffered burns and memory loss, then was taken in by someone and made to believe he was a different person by that someone telling him about this other person he supposedly was, and then he somehow found his way into the PPC and became an agent? Maybe the PPC put him in DOGA or something so that he wouldn&#39;t ever run into anyone who knew about his past? Hmm. (Crud, does this description make me sound like a Suethor? I think I screwed up the wording or something and made it sound like that.)<br><br>Anyway, now that I think about it, I&#39;d have to tweak that backstory around a bit more, since it wouldn&#39;t make sense for one of the two villains (and I mean a seriously Stu replacement) to take on that other life. He would just get killed, because the agent in the story would be after him as well as another Sue in his fic. How&#39;s that up there sound, either way?<br><br>-Twistey</p>

            <p>I don&#39;t think we&#39;re talking about the same thing. If I have parsed what you said correctly, you have a character who is the canon that has been injured and then lied to about his identity. His entire personality is based on lies that have been imposed on him by those that recruited him.<br><br>If that is what you were saying then it isn&#39;t what I was trying to say. The main distinction I am trying to make with Kelok is the Suethor did the altering, not the agents who recruited him. He&#39;s also fully aware of where he came from. <br><br>He wasn&#39;t a Stu as written in his story. I&#39;d always recommend killing a Sue/Stu or exorcising/deglittering/memory wiping a canon that hasn&#39;t been replaced. His was a pretty specific situation with a canon replacement who isn&#39;t a Sue/Stu.<br><br>Agents aren&#39;t meant to the coolest or most super powered either (which the main characters often are in their own canons). I think it actually makes it more difficult to write good, interesting PPC missions with a highly powered agent than one who has to scrape by on ingenuity.<br><br>One final comment. If the agent is meant to be the actual canon, then it really limits what you can do with them. You have to constantly think about keeping them in-character with the canon material. There isn&#39;t much room for growth and change while respecting that. With a character who is your own (however they came to the PPC or your general fiction) you get to direct their development and decide what is in-character for them. It is relaxing in a lot of ways to be fully in charge of that as an author.</p>

            <p>(Since I wanted to see if this would pass muster as a character. Although there are a few points:)<br><br>1-2. Actually, the character I came up with wasn&#39;t a canon originally, but rather a character replacement. Altered by the Suethor (if that&#39;s how they come to be) and then convinced of a different backstory by a different person (probably outside of the PPC, as this&#39;d have to be someone who isn&#39;t out to kill him.)<br><br>3. Yep. In this story, the agents (whoever they are) intended to kill him, but when he had the incident that gave him the burns and the memory loss, they probably either got distracted or thought he&#39;d died/thought he was going to die soon and left him for dead.<br><br>4. Definitely. I seriously can&#39;t consciously write a Mary Sue without it being a joke. This idea was mainly to generate some interesting plots due to administration having to keep him from finding out his identity and also due to the actual canon also probably being out to kill him.<br><br>5. That is a good point. I think I&#39;ve decided against the idea for using a canon as an agent (as I clarified, this idea was separate from the canon question, and the canon I thought of using had pretty much nothing to do with it.) But still a good idea.<br><br>-Twistey</p>

            <p>Whether the canon is a clone or not, recruiting a canon is generally frowned upon. I think the main reason is a sense that if our mission is to defend canon, twisting it by forcibly recruiting characters for the PPC is a bit hypocritical; even ignoring that the burden of characterisation for writing a canon character has the bar set very high.<br><br>As with all &#39;rules&#39; of writing, yes there are exceptions. But I would not <i>recommend</i> recruiting a canon. If you do so, it has to be done exceptionally well, and that makes it a more difficult option.<br>Suicide worked because Tungsten Monk was an excellent writer, but could have easily have become a travesty.<br><br>I think the same warning also applies to recruiting Sue&#39;d /alternate / character replacement versions of canon, albeit to a lesser extent. There&#39;s still that high standard of writing required. While it does unlock some opportunities for great writing when you have the opportunity to explore the conflict between the canon&#39;s natural personality and the Suvian influences, it can get out of hand. A great example is Agent Dafydd: well-written, and him being an alternate version of Maglor led to some great conflict when the Fëanorian side was aided and abetted by Suvian jewellery, but I can&#39;t imagine Dafydd being an easy character to write well!<br><br>TLDR version: yes, while it&#39;s been done in the past, as Nesh has said, it&#39;s a fairly shaky precedent. Definitely not something we&#39;d recommend as your first agent. The bar will be set very high.<br><br>Elcalion<br><br><br></p>

            <p>Although if the character replacement is OOC, but not Sued, and one recruits them, it looks like they practically turn into original characters - at least, that&#39;s what a lot of recruited replacements seem to be. Wouldn&#39;t that kind of situation make it less standard-y, maybe just a bit more than an original agent would be?<br><br>-Twistey</p>

            <p>That is pretty much what happens to recruited character replacements. As replacements, they explicitly are not the canon character they&#39;ve replaced, just someone who might kinda sorta maybe look like them and share a couple things in common.<br><br>But if I understand you right, no, I don&#39;t think that makes them more unique or &quot;non-standard&quot; than a completely original character. Even characters you made up yourself are going to draw on inspiration from somewhere—more likely multiple somewheres.<br><br>Nume, for instance, largely draws on Dr. House, another cantankerous but very intelligent misanthrope with a substance dependency and, maybe, a heart of gold. He&#39;s also a little bit based on my dad and a big bit on your archetypal `70s nerd, with a weird memory and some weird hangups about sexuality for spice.<br><br>Derik, while looking like the Phantom of the Opera, sharing a passion for music, and being a little bit off his rocker, is mostly an ex-dragonrider with all the selfless devotion to duty and protecting others that entails. He&#39;s a product of his badfic, but he&#39;s even more a product of my love for both canons, and dragons, and music, and seriousface hero types wrestling with their dark side.<br><br>Make sense?<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

<li>Hang on, I was mainly thinking of Derik when I wrote that, but he&#39;s less of a character replacement and more of a &quot;side character drawing from something else that doesn&#39;t belong here&quot;, right?

            <p>What makes a good fanfic is not equal to what makes a good PPC mission.  Writing a canon character well in a mission generally entails them remaining in the canon and writing their reactions to the Sues or other bad influences in the badfic, whether they are overcome or try to resist the Sue-influence.  Bringing canons into the PPC would go against what they stand for- leaving canon intact.<br><br>You write that any characters your create or recruit will immediately become adoptable or free-to-use, so more experienced writers could attempt it.  But how do you know that a more experienced writer will <i>want</i> to?  hS wrote above that the second rule of recruiting characters is to have a plan for them- that means you would be writing them.<br><br>Besides, creating good OCs is also a difficult skill, like writing canons, but it&#39;s much closer to what the PPC is focused on.<br><br>-A.

<li>Yep, that has already been said, and I do understand now.<br><br>2. Let me explain my situation yet again. I told my parents about you guys. My parents don&#39;t like you. My parents don&#39;t like the idea of correcting someone&#39;s fanfic without being asked to do so. My dad also has a thing about the fact that you call yourselves the &quot;protectors&quot; of anything (he believes it suggests megalomania or other forms of brain damage, see also legitimate IRL cults.) I stay on the Board because it&#39;s somewhat lesser-known. Putting things down on Wattpad or on my Google account would probably make it easier for my parents to know that I&#39;m associating with you against their will. I&#39;m trying to be safe here. That&#39;s the main reason why I want to do the free to use thing, because if they&#39;re mine and they&#39;re PPC, I&#39;m likely to be dead meat. It does sort of take away some of the experience, I know, but it&#39;s for the better, and I&#39;ll probably put up regular fanfic for you to review so that I&#39;ll still learn the writing lessons I need.<br><br>-Twistey</li>

            <p>Ilraen, Derik, and Gall are all recruits I picked up because I really wanted to write them.<br><br>Ilraen is an Andalite, which is cool to start with, and I needed someone Nume could be convinced to work with after his original partner, Cameo, turned out to be an awful person I didn&#39;t want to write anymore. Then I got to play with the idea of someone who has had to build himself from the ground up, without the benefit of normal childhood formative experiences. Now that he&#39;s matured a bit, he&#39;s going through some teenage-ish angst about who he really is, and how his human upbringing (if you can call it that) meshes and clashes with his Andalite identity.<br><br>Derik was a side-character who existed for more or less the sole purpose of being a visual gag: &quot;LOL, wouldn&#39;t it be funny if there was a dragonrider called E&#39;rik who looked like the Phantom of the Opera and had a dragon called &#39;mask&#39; in Swedish?!?!1&quot; He didn&#39;t really do anything, he was just there. I happen to be a PotO fan AND a Pern fan, so I couldn&#39;t leave the poor guy like that. I was interested in starting a new spin-off in the DMS to take on the Sues my DIC team couldn&#39;t, and Derik was a shoo-in for me.<br><br>I originally paired him with Earwig, a kender made up by Phobos, whose shenanigans were intended to be a foil to Derik&#39;s drama, but I couldn&#39;t write the guy, and Phobos didn&#39;t really want to, either. Then Gall came along, and she was just perfect: sassy, no fluff, no nonsense. Ideal for poking Derik in his sore spots and refusing to let him dwell on them at the same time. Since HtTYD is a bit anachronistic, she can also make most of the jokes and references I want to make, too. And she&#39;s a girl. I thought I should have at least one girl in my line-up, since I am one myself, and it lets me bring that perspective to Suedo-feminism.<br><br>I&#39;ll also note that at least one member of FicPsych is <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=241484;article=2881;title=PPC%20Message%20Board;pagemark=25">on record</a> as hating it when agents dump helpless bit parts on them and then abandon them. {= )<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I&#39;d also add a slight corollary: &quot;Don&#39;t write Agent X because you want an agent of Agent X&#39;s cool and/or awesome species/sect/fandom/whatever, write them because you want to write Agent X&quot;. It&#39;s a principle that served me well from right back when I started - which hS took an active part in moulding.<br><br>Wobbles the Clown appeared because I wanted to do a genuine unironic clown, and up she popped; a happy-go-lucky sort whose happiness, luckiness, and (somehow) goness came about because of her previous life as an angstfic refugee who was intended to provide comic relief in the badfic itself but who was instead basically the chew toy of every electrical appliance in a given area. This desperate desire to make people happy (as well as the obligatory FicPsych sessions) made her into the clown we know and love today, but she was in need of a foil.<br><br>Then up pops something called the Continuity Council of Gallifrey, masterminded largely by hS and largely concerning the Time Lord agents of various oldbies, veryoldbies, and similarlygeriatricbies. I wanted to take part but, not having quite read the memo, bashed out a few syllables that sounded Gallifreyan and called the woman wearing them The Notary. When hS (via Morgan) pointed out that there were a lot of Time Lord agents who were Time Lords because it was cool, I wanted to refute that, so I began to think more about who the Notary was.<br><br>Now, in previous Whovian RPs on a Nintendo fansite that were frankly rubbish, I&#39;d often used an OC Time Lord called the Gardener: righter of wrongs, snogger of aliens, part-time planet builder, and manager of a branch of Little Chef on the A504 just outside Milton Keynes. I <i>liked</i> playing as her, because she was fun to be around, and the original draft of the Notary was going to be much more like her. Then I thought some more about the Notary, and how I didn&#39;t want to play into hS&#39;s hands and give him a reason to boot me out of the RP... and that&#39;s why the Notary is the way she is.<br><br>It&#39;s detailed here and there in missions and RPs and ficlet responses, but the Fourth Notary was very much akin to my old Gardener OC in terms of temperament, drive, and weird hobbies involving greasy spoon management. However, I decided that that should very much be the past of the Notary, and then I remembered <i>The Twin Dilemma</i>, a Sixth Doctor episode wherein he throttles longtime companion Peri. It was under different circumstances, of course, but then I thought about what that would do to someone if they couldn&#39;t take it back, if that lonely old time traveller just let themselves rot in a decaying, unloved TARDIS. Suddenly the Notary&#39;s whole life story rolled out in front of me; this tired, defeated woman whose life has just been one indignity after another, until she finally got to be a hero... and then it was taken away, so she thinks. She was everything wrong with Time Lord society, everything that was rotten and corrupt about it... but, as Nirvana Crane once said (of someone else), &quot;Somewhere under that pile of neuroses is someone nice trying to claw their way out&quot;.<br><br>From there, the dynamic with Wobbles practically wrote itself - Ronald McDonald paired with some ghastly little Napoleon from the local JobCentre has all the trappings of a normal agent pairing. So I decided to amplify those traits, really play up Wobbles&#39; Pollyanna nature and the Notary&#39;s superiority complex, as a commentary on how limiting the standard hot-and-cold two person dynamic can be. Then Lola kept poking her head round the door, so I decided to bung her in as an agent, too - and then <i>her</i> story rolled out.<br><br>In fact, the only characters whose stories don&#39;t tie directly into that of the Oncoming Form are Doktor Trollenfisch und Gabrielle, who I wrote with the specific purpose of being soft and fluffy and having happy endings. Even then, they might not be separate from the rest of my agent stable for too long... though to say more would be spoilers. =]</p>

            <p>The only question I&#39;d have about this is: what if you&#39;re trying to challenge yourself to make a character of a cliche/frequently-used/frequently-done-badly species/etc and successfully dodge the tropes? I know I&#39;ve done that at least once by drawing a legitimately scary neko Creepypasta. Would I be correct in saying that as long as the character is done well and has a purpose as hS says, the fact that I created the character as a challenge of my character creation skills is okay?<br><br>-Twistey</p>

            <p>Be cool to see, that! &#39;Specially given how very subversive the PPC, as a whole, is. It&#39;s a good thing, that, to have a proper plan for a character beyond &#39;They should do some stuff&#39; or, lord help, &#39;They should do some stuff and be real strong and have cool powers and be real cool.&#39; Playing around with tropes is always brilliant. Long as you give &#39;em more character beyond subversion, of course. Good starting point, subversion. <br><br>Also, I disagree with Scape&#39;s point. <br>I think you should watch Red Dwarf if, and only if, you want to see a really good show and you&#39;re real smart and cool and nice smelling and you like really good things. </p>

            <p>There&#39;s a fun series of role-plays that I&#39;ve started with my friends, called &quot;Victims of the Plot,&quot; in which one friend and I are in a specific continuum and we gradually get hit by more and more fanfic tropes, so we have to escape the continuum or something before we turn into flat-out Mary Sues and lose our common sense.

            <p>...although I do have another half-cat character in a sci-fi story who (at the very least) subverts the appearance tropes of a neko. Meaning that she&#39;s got whiskers, has teeth that are actually feline in nature (instead of little fangs and the rest just being human teeth), and is covered in a thin coat of fuzz, which is all the better for cuddling, if you ask me. :3<br><br>Heh, maybe I should make her even more cat-like. Make her feet into hind paws, give her somewhat of a feline facial structure (but not too much, this isn&#39;t meant to be anthro/furry-esque), etc. She also subverts some neko behavior tropes as well - she is benevolent and friendly, but not necessarily &quot;kawaii&quot; (see the behaviors associated with cuteness in the Springhole.net article below.) She&#39;s less like a housecat (as your <i>Red Dwarf</i> guy is, and more like a wild or feral cat with a more human level of intellect. A couple other details of her behavior are that she&#39;s carnivorous and hunts for food, and does the standard cat stretch thing when waking up. So yeah, I&#39;m pretty sure I&#39;ve done it.

            <p>First: <br><br>My Little Unicorn Series<br><br>Tv Tropes page (for those who want to check it out but don&#39;t want to expose their eyes to it): <img src="http://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1469186110i/34529._UY1170_SS1170_.jpg" alt="http://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1469186110i/34529._UY1170_SS1170_.jpg"> <br><br>Number of Past Year Google Hits: 5 on the first page<br><br>Explanation: So, once upon a time there was this guy who went by Dakari King Mykan. And he watched My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic and decided he hated it. So he decided to write his own alternate universe without all the things he hated, like Equestria (the story instead takes place in Unicornicopia- I&#39;m not joking, that&#39;s the name) the canon characters (He focuses on his own OCs, who are all anthro winged unicorns with special attacks), the message of friendship (replaced with a message of believing- what they&#39;re supposed to believe in is unclear), and character depth &amp; development of any sort (He thinks it takes away from the action, so all characters shown basically consist of a name and a gimmick). Throw in a complete and total lack of originality and writing skills, and you&#39;ve pretty much got the idea.<br><br>Second:<br><br>The Conversion Bureau<br><br>Tv Tropes Page: <img src="http://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1469186110i/34529._UY1170_SS1170_.jpg" alt="http://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1469186110i/34529._UY1170_SS1170_.jpg"> <br><br>Number of Past Year Google Hits: All but 4 results on the first two pages<br><br>Explanation: This one is a bit iffy, since by now the general idea of the original fic The Conversion Bureau has become its own genre, with highly varying authors and quality (I believe most people would point to Chatoyance&#39;s take on TCB as the worst). However, the original fic is quite poorly done and very well-known in the fandom, so here goes:<br><br>Equestria has landed on Earth, and humans naturally want to go there, since they&#39;re all evil brutes who&#39;ve been killing each other off via wars, disease, and  the other usual suspects. However, to do so you must (presumably permanently) become a pony, via a serum from the eponymous Conversion Bureaus. A serum that causes the drinker to lose that pesky &quot;human nature&quot; of theirs so they can live in harmony with others. Converts must also adapt to Equestrian culture.<br><br>Our Hero goes to get ponified at a clinic conveniently staffed by the Mane Six (despite all of them having canon occupations) and instantly befriends them and goes to live with them in Equestria. <br><br>Now, the author&#39;s intent was that the wish-fulfillment was the central part of the fic, but the misanthropic undertones that he didn&#39;t intend (or at least, not quite so blatantly) were latched onto by some of the creepier members of the fandom, who added some extra horror (Equestria is surrounded by a Barrier that is expanding, sometimes because Celestia&#39;s deliberately expanding it to force ponification, and there are pro-pony and pro-human terrorist groups), wrote prolifically, and turned what was originally a very poor fic into a MLP-specific genre.<br><br>It should be noted that while the original fic is definitely not as bad as some spinoffs (TCB stories exist that take the entire thing up to eleven), that&#39;s less &#39;well, this is good-ish&#39; and more &#39;I may have fallen off a giant cliff and am now hurtling at terminal velocity towards my doom, but at least I&#39;m not also on fire&#39;.</p>

            <p>I swear guys, I really, truly, honestly will tackle My Little Unicorn. I have been saying it for years now, but it will happen. That abomination of a fic is <i>mine.</i> There has been a slight hiccup, in that the story has been taken down most places. Now, this is not because Mykan has become ashamed of his past work. No, it seems it has been taken down from FanFic.Net, Fimfiction, and DiviantArt, because it was <u><i>too bad.</i></u> The story broke several rules, and was taken down by the websites, not by the author. So, in my eyes, still fair game. Besides, this thing has made the rounds of Something Awful quite a bit. It is infamous in the brony fanfic community. At least, it was. Don&#39;t know it&#39;s status now. Still as rancid as ever. Why, I think I should do a dramatic reading of this abomination of a fic. I do have a few days off coming soon...<br><br>Anyway, as much as I would love to go into the histories and the impacts of these stories, the fact remains that, they are not Legendary Badfic for the PPC. Generally, Legendary Badfic are the kinds of stories that <i>everyone</i> who is aware of what fanfiction is has heard of. To stay with MLP, not everyone knows Death and Resurrection, but we all have heard of Cupcakes. These stories are close to qualifying. Darn close. Especially the Conversion Beuru. But, on the whole, I just don&#39;t think these are nearly well known enough in the PPC subculture to count as Legendary Badfic. Sorry.<br><br>Not going to make My Little Unicorn any less painful to tackle, but still.</p>

            <p>Let&#39;s take a look at the criteria:<br><br>- It&#39;s definitely over 5 years old, the original fic was apparently published in 2011.<br>- A Google search for the last year brings up lots of search results... But they&#39;re all spin-offs. I&#39;m not sure those qualify as search results about the original fic itself.<br>- Does it really <i>count</i> as being &quot;famous in its own right&quot; when most of the recent hits are from spin-offs? Everyone knows <i>of</i> the original fic but what most of the fans think when they hear of TCB is the genre it created. As an example, I always assumed the Barrier thing was in the original fic, but apparently it&#39;s not? But I&#39;m not exactly active in the fandom anymore so I might just be out of the loop.<br>- Last one requires a vote of PPCers, let&#39;s see what happens.</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve been going through the various posts in the Grand Concilliary, and I&#39;ve seen multiple suggestions regarding somehow teaching people how to be better betas. I think this is an excellent idea, and I&#39;m more than willing to head up a little activity for all willing participants. <br><br>I have two ideas in mind (based on the main thread). I&#39;ll put them both below for comment and feedback. Whichever one appears to be more popular by next Tuesday, I&#39;ll launch as the actual activity.<br><br><b>Proposal One: The Blind Beta Exchange</b><br><br>Every participant writes a two to four page story. It can be PPC-related, but it doesn&#39;t have to be. Want to make it about your unrelated original universe? Sure, I&#39;m game! The Organizer (that is, me) will then take the stories and assign them randomly to all participants for betaing so as to avoid any bias. Once everything&#39;s been done, the beta&#39;d stories are returned to me, and I will post them—without names—in a specific thread. Then, everyone can publicly comment on the beta notes. Once that&#39;s done, everyone reveals who they were. We learn a little bit about betaing, and maybe a little bit about ourselves.<br><br><b>Proposal Two: Watch and Learn</b><br><br>This one has a little less participation, but could potentially be more instructive. In this case, an experienced beta would volunteer to go through an example piece. Everyone can watch, read, and ask questions/give feedback. Perhaps multiple veterans can be called in, so as to demonstrate different methods and approaches.<br><br>On a slight tangent, I&#39;m also going to be posting an example of what I feel is very good beta work (not mine, although it was of something I did) either tonight or tomorrow. Perhaps that might help some people come to a decision.<br><br>If you have questions, comments, or suggestions for other activities, I&#39;m happy to hear them.<br><br>PoorCynic</p>

            <p>Also, I like both options, but since everybody is so eager to submit stories, it will probably be Proposal One, so I&#39;ll try to come up with another interlude.

            <p>I beta-read several Gdocs not being loged in before I finally got an account to put my own stories up for beta-reading.<br><br>PoorCynic just needs to set the Gdoc&#39;s properties to &quot;everybody can comment&quot; (supposed that they can even see the document) and &quot;everybody who has the link can read&quot;, where the assigned beta is the only person to whom PC sends the link. If you got the link and want to stay anonymous, just be careful to not login (or to deliberately logout) before you open the document, and you will be assigned a random name like &quot;anonymous goldfish&quot;.  <br><br>The bigger problem is keeping the authors anonymous while they edit the document in response to the comments. This may actually involve copying the commented document so that the author can edit without the beta watching, and then copying the revised document back into the copy on PC&#39;s account that the beta can see (or making a new copy and sending a new link to the beta) for another read-through. <br><br>Setting the properties to &quot;everybody can edit&quot; (supposed that they can even see the document), where only the author and the beta get links to the copy owned by PC might spare PC a lot of tedious work, but would set up an unrealistic situation, because betas usually should only make suggestions, but should not be able to edit directly. <br><br>(Note that I don&#39;t know the exact wording of the properties, because Google talks German to me.)<br><br>HG</p>

            <p>I mean, at first, anyhow. It serves to show the betaing process so it can get seen and commented on by everyone else, and also keeps the context of what&#39;s actually being beta&#39;d. Which will certainly be a whole lot smoother, I imagine! <br><br>Perhaps it could have two stages - the first stage, in which the stories, unedited and commented on, are posted, are seen, get concrit, et al. And then, a bit later on, there&#39;d be the second stage, where the fics are all finished and polished and fancy, with no comments and all the advice having been accounted for, and just get sort&#39;ve posted. For funsies. <br><br>The first stage is, obviously, the one that&#39;s more relevant to the whole &#39;learning to beta&#39; thing, but it&#39;s nice to see the finished products, too, innit?  Like, Iunno, Masterchef, when they do a close-up dolly shot of the single nugget of beef with leaf on the side, after it&#39;s been made and judged. Or some such. I don&#39;t watch MasterChef much. </p>

            <p>Looks to be a pretty solid idea, in general. Proposal Two looks like it&#39;ll be a bit awkward, y&#39;know? Dunno in what way we&#39;ll be able to contact the veteran, but I imagine it might be a touch awkward, whether it&#39;s vocal chat or just the GDocs chat window thingy.

            <p>It helps if you have a lot of very defensively-oriented Pokémon on your team; because entry hazards, status effects, &amp;c do set percentages of the target&#39;s HP as damage, you can outlast the opposition and stonewall everything they try.

            <p>So, you may or may not remember <b>history of japan</b>, which was a really nifty video that taught you everything you needed to know about, well. The history. of Japan. If you haven&#39;t seen it, you should check it out, because it&#39;s pure comedy gold and you might even learn some things!<br><br>Now, the creator- Bill Wurtz- has re-emerged with a more ambitious video- <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuCn8ux2gbs">history of the entire world, i guess</a> which is twice as long and just as wonderfully educating.<br><br><b>Language warning for both of these, if you don&#39;t like swearing.</b> But it&#39;s worth it, I promise.</p>
