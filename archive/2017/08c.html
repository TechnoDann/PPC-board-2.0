            <p>The sun goes dark. Shadows cover the Earth. From the depths of the forests, they swarm in uncounted trillions, reclaiming at last the world they have long coveted. The Vashta Nerada are free once more.<br><br>The sun goes dark. A voice booms from the heavens, reverberating from the mountains: &quot;The Twilight of the Gods is upon us. Behold the triumph of Fenrir!&quot; Bounding across the stars, you can make out the black form of the Wolf as it devours the light.<br><br>The sun goes dark. Words appear on its blackened visage: &quot;The day is gone...&quot; After a moment, they shift and warp. &quot;Without a trace...&quot; The letters seem to melt away, revealing a new set underneath. &quot;Face the Dark...&quot; Each letter becomes an eye of fire, reforming into a fourth message: &quot;With a smooth face.&quot; Totality is reached. The corona flares into view, and with it a final message: &quot;Burma-Shave.&quot;<br><br>The sun goes dark. The moon is halo&#39;d against the golden corona. Across the nation, everyone can see as the lunar crust cracks open, and a draconic head, large as worlds, thrusts out of the shell.<br><br>The sun goes dark. Then light. Then dark. Then light. As darkness returns, a voice calls plaintively from inside the house: &quot;Damien, leave the light switch alone, there&#39;s a good boy...&quot;<br><br>The sun goes dark. The observatory buzzes with conversation. We knew the transit of Venus was going to be spectacular - but we never expected something like this.<br><br>The sun goes dark. A total eclipse crosses North America coast-to-coast. Add your own.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>The sun goes dark. Malaysia does not see the shadow. A person looks at the sky and see the clouds gathering. &quot;Time to get the laundry.&quot; He remembers seeing the sun eclipsed by the moon as a child before his maid pulls him back inside. &quot;Do not go outside! Dragon wants to eat the moon.&quot;<br><br>He remembers watching the TV, and Chinese people of his country clanging cymbals and playing gongs to chase away the dragon. The Muslim Malays do the eclipse prayers. He was a child, he did not have to attend. The Indians offer prayers in their temples.<br><br>The eclipse was over in minutes. The gossiping goes for years. It will be almost a century before such an event can be seen again. &quot;Will I live to see it again?&quot;</p>

            <p>The sun goes dark. A man walks into a bar. A man walks into a wall. A man walks into another man. A man trips over, stumbles down a series of stairs, knocks over a row of rubbish bins, gets coke all over his shirt, and wishes his phone&#39;s torch function wasn&#39;t bugged. <br><br>The sun goes dark. Humans are <i>fascinated</i>. The Mole People, gazing up above through their spyports, pause briefly in their invasion plans to wonder what the big deal is. <br><br>The sun goes dark. Vampires prowl the streets freely. Ambitious travelling garlic salesmen soon join them. It is hard to decide whose tactics are more aggressive. <br><br>The sun goes dark. As the streetlamps start to flicker and die, the last plate is bolted, the last lens is rooted in place, the last blowtorch sparks. The Sunrise Mechanism is completed. The people who can afford to have it shining over their cities wonder why all the people who whinge about not being able to afford it don&#39;t just get jobs. <br><br>The Sun goes dark. The Moon cleans off her spear, dropping the bloodied fabric, which tumbles down and births a new continent. She basks in the bowing submission of the survivors. Their new god shines over them, turns them silver against the night. <br><br>The sun goes dark. Suddenly, the conditions in which groups of organised humans attack other groups of organised humans are deeply unsuitable. World peace is attained. This is promptly fixed when they stop fumbling long around enough to figure out where the torches are. <br><br>The sun goes dark. The Artist takes an ineffable finger off the switch, looks down on his project, shrugs a pair of ineffable shoulders. Maybe the next try will go better. He has grown an inexplicable fondness for possums, so perhaps he will use <i>them</i> instead of apes, this time. </p>

            <p>This is an interesting concept, actually.  Alec clearly still doesn&#39;t <i>like</i> his scars, but he also &quot;sides&quot; with them over the phoenix tattoo out of familiarity.  It&#39;s an interesting sort of mindset/emotional state to think about.  (I would be horrendously bothered by something like that showing up that I couldn&#39;t hide, even without a pre-existing mark for it to overlay.)<br><br>I also really like the flashback scene to the explosion.  I haven&#39;t read or watched any <i>Bond</i>, so it was essentially an original scene for me.  I love the little detail that Alec calls Bond &quot;James&quot; in his mind.  It&#39;s still clear enough who he&#39;s referring to, but it makes sense that one of Baond&#39;s actual colleagues would just think of him as &quot;guy I know&quot; rather than having all the franchising/memeage associated with Bond from our media perspective.<br><br>I also like that Kitty&#39;s appearance at the end kind of works for the reader the same way it does for Alec: things have changed, but it&#39;s still a PPC spin-off.  rather cute!<br><br>&quot;And now the reminder of that betrayal was altered by the mark that had insinuated itself over top of it like an ink-wash.&quot;<br>I think you wanted a &quot;the&quot; there in &quot;over the top of it,&quot; unless this is a phrasing style I&#39;ve never encountered before.<br><br>—doctorlit, not really wanting to track down all the Bond novels to read them, ever</p>

            <p>It&#39;s actually something interesting that I noticed upon my thousandth rewatch to write this - the two of them are still on first-name terms, even when they&#39;re enemies. (They even <i>banter</i> - well, they trade, eh, inside jokes of a kind? Things they used to say on their missions together?) Alec is actually the <i>only</i> Bond villain (maybe minus Spectre, but I really don&#39;t care to watch that one again) who addresses Bond as &quot;James&quot; throughout.<br><br>(Hello, I am the person nobody ever wants to go against in James Bond trivia, can you tell?)<br><br>There&#39;s no explanation as to how Alec survived the explosion in the film or the novelization, so I had to make it up out of whole cloth. I hope it wasn&#39;t too unbelievable!<br><br>And yeah, that&#39;s the phrasing I wanted! I&#39;m not 100% sure where I picked that up but I know it&#39;s a thing people say...somewhere...probably........</p>

            <p>Hello everyone, and welcome to the PPC scavenger hunt! This is a new game, where boarders look for various uncommon to extremely rare things in fanfic (mostly badfic) and then get points for finding them. Whoever has the most points at the end wins.</p>

<p>There are 50 items to find, all of which are worth one point. To enter the game, make a reply to this post title "[your name]'s finds". When you find something, reply to that post, including the item you found in the subject, and quote the part of the fic that you found the item in and link to the fic. You can't use the exact same thing as another boarder, but using something else from the same sentence for the same item on the list. </p>

<p>Also, to keep the scavenger hunt safe for people verifying finds, NSFW or NSFB fics are not allowed. This is probably going to mean T-rated or below fic. To keep things interesting, any items must be found in chapters that were published at on or after 2017-07-23, and anything from any fic that has been PPC'ed is not allowed. The game will run until the end of 2017-09-24, EST (to match the timestamps on the main board).</p>

<p>Now that the rules are out of the way, here are the items to find, all of which I have seen in fic (although not necessarily in eligible fic) :</p>

<ol>
<li> A mini with three or more letters added, deleted, or removed </li>
<li> An object of an impossible color </li>
<li> A Suvian reformed within their own fic </li>
<li> A sentence with more SPaG errors than words </li>
<li> An author's note in the middle of the chapter </li>
<li> A heading in the form of "[character]'s POV" </li>
<li> A generic weapon </li>
<li> An instance of reader bashing </li>
<li> A pronoun problem between two characters not being shipped </li>
<li> A nonsensical illness </li>
<li> An instance of "Canon" misspelled as "cannon" </li>
<li> A completely unromantic scene intended as romance </li>
<li> A canonical creature described in a completely wrong manner </li>
<li> A character with a negative age </li>
<li> A piece of figurative language that makes more sense when interpreted literally </li>
<li> A page-long paragraph ("pageagraph") </li>
<li> An uncanonical character who would be OOC resistant or immune if canon </li>
<li> A badfic shorter than 500 words </li>
<li> A soap opera cough </li>
<li> A character who checks off an excessive number of common Mary Sue traits </li>
<li> A character who is over 99% OOC but not replaced </li>
<li> A sentence that ends in a punctuation mark not normally used to end sentences </li>
<li> A poorly-written poly relationship </li>
<li> An unclosed parenthesis or similar punctuation mark </li>
<li> An author's note not marked as such. </li>
<li> An unintelligible acronym </li>
<li> An LGBT+ Suvian </li>
<li> A character who is both bashed and a Suvian's LO in the same fic </li>
<li> A ship which is obviously a bad idea </li>
<li> A ridiculously flimsy excuse for two characters falling in twu wuv </li>
<li> A misuse of mathematics </li>
<li> A sentence which does not begin with a capital letter </li>
<li> A summary (including any tags) which implies at least three charges </li>
<li> A series of three or more of the same punctuation mark </li>
<li> A comma splice </li>
<li> An unnecessary line break </li>
<li> A correctly used semicolon </li>
<li> Food with an impossible flavor </li>
<li> A nonsensical object (such as "Long Table Elrond") </li>
<li> A word misspelled as a different word </li>
<li> A number used as a word </li>
<li> A canonically incorrect romantic custom </li>
<li> A completely generic setting </li>
<li> A sentence with three or more ambiguous pronouns </li>
<li> A character that has no reason to appear in prose (\^, |, _, etc.) </li>
<li> An unattributed line of dialogue </li>
<li> A statement of something obvious </li>
<li> A character with the same name as the author </li>
<li> A summary or title with a SPaG error </li>
<li> A good CAHQ card (Anything extra weird that doesn't fit one of the above items) </li>
</ol>

<p>Good luck hunters!</p>

<p>Yes, seriously. The story is marked as "Dumbles bashing" as well (though later on, in this same chapter they call him Dumbledore, so maybe it's on purpose?). By the way, Harry is actually a Malfoy, gets sorted on both Slytherin and "Gryfinndor" (which I think would make a lovely mini-Aragog) and his best friends are Hermione and Draco (who suddenly isn't racist). Let's not go over their powers, though be warned they include something called "Magic Siphoning". Please, <em>please</em>, spork it.</p>

<p>That's a fairly classic Persona badfic there: Uncanon character joins the fun and still thunder with his 'unique' Persona (like all the canon characters), hitting on canon characters, and questionnable SpaG. This one is 'original' though, because he's a cousin to Persona 1 protagonist.</p>

<p><i>I originally went to school at <b>St.Merlin high</b>, which was located in the city of Mikage-cho. Apperently there was a big conspiracy with an old company called sebec, and their branch president, Takahisa Kandori. Ever since then, the town had a bad reputation of being haunted by evil spirits, but its just stupid superstition.</i></p><i>

</i><p><i>But last January, I was told that I would be transferred to a different school and city. A city called, Iwatodi. A city that is runned by the Kirijo group... I think? I have to wonder though, why was I getting transferred to this type of place. "<em>Sigh</em> maybe it was a mistake, or maybe Naoya was worried about me." My cousin, Naoya Toudou is what you would call... a very worried person I would believe. But in the end he's always been there for when I needed some to talk to.</i></p>

<p>That said, the spelling of St. Hermelin is a bit... off.</p>

<p>Heck, I can pretty much quote the entire fic.</p>

<p><i>Yukari Takeba is a curvy, slim and helpful archer from Japan. Her life is going nowhere until she meets Mitsuru Kirijo, a slender, sexy woman with a passion for fighting Shadows
Yukari takes an instant disliking to Mitsuru and the cold-blooded and arrogant ways she learnt during her years in Japan.
However, when a thug tries to rob Yukari, Mitsuru springs to the rescue. Yukari begins to notices that Mitsuru is actually rather courageous at , the pressures of Mitsuru's job as a heir to the Kirijo group leave her blind to Yukari's affections and Yukari takes up writing to try an distract herself.</i></p><i>

</i><p><i>Finally, when rude school student, Minato Arisato, threatens to come between them, Mitsuru has to act fast. But will they ever find the passionate love that they deserve?</i></p>

<p>I'm sure I could squeeze more items out of that...</p>

<p>https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12153324/1/No-Woman-Am-I is, of all things, a trans!Eowyn character replacement. I've read over the first chapter and 'Dernhelm' is definitely replaced; he says this to Faramir in the Houses of Healing: "Do not mourn [Boromir], then, for he found a glorious death, while you will be slaughtered like a dog. Envy him."</p>

<p>Sadly, the most recent chapter doesn't contain any evidence of Suvianness; he seems to be aiming towards a romance with Lothiriel, who's also gone pretty OOC. But I can't claim a #27 'LGBT+ Suvian' from the last month.</p>

<p></p><hr><p></p>

<p>A near miss for #14, 'A character with a negative age':</p>

<p>https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11778904/3/My-Precious</p>

<p>This is a retelling of Smeagol's fall into Gollum. Here's the entirety of Chapter 3:</p>

<p><i>I suddenly heard a loud piercing scream which I only assume could be Mrs.Brandybuck. "Deagol! Deagol is dead!" She screamed</i></p>

<p>Deagol died nowhere near the Shire, so this is impossible. But, sadly for me, he did die about a hundred years <i>after</i> Gorhendad Oldbuck changed his family's name to Brandybuck.</p>

<p>It's a poem. It <i>starts out</i> by comparing Legolas to 'a child of Apollo'. It later claims he 'has never touched a beer', which directly contradicts movie canon. It's just... bad.</p>

<p>I really wanted to claim it for #13, A canonical creature described in a completely wrong manner, as well, but figured 'character' and 'creature' were a little too different.</p>

<p>1) Altering the timeline; Legolas did not return to Mirkwood after the War, but settled in Ithilien.
2) Also, the Fellowship didn't go with him.
3) Mirkwood was never renamed Greenwood, but became Eryn Lasgalen, 'Wood of the Green Leaves'.
4) 'Ava' is not an Elvish name, nor (in case it comes up) a Mannish one in Middle-earth.
5) Grammar errors all over the place.
6) While they're not necessarily charges, the childhood friend and unidentified Men from Gondor do not bode well.</p>

            <p>I'm claiming Galadriel from https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12620427/2/Enchantment-Passing-Through. She has description like this:</p>

<p><i>The Lady Galadriel was tall and poised, every inch of her screaming royalty. Her face was always calm and serene, a beautiful wall hiding the raging storm of power and emotion Laerorniel knew was surging underneath.</i></p>

<p>And telepathic lines like this:</p>

<p><i>The Dark Power call to me, too. It draws us both. I can feel it here, as do you. It is carried by a hobbit by the name of Frodo Baggins.</i></p>

<p>She bears very little resemblance to the Galadriel of the books... <i>but</i> she is actually pretty plausible as a version who made different life choices. Artanis Nerwen was very similar to her uncle Feanor; this version clearly stuck with that, rather than mellowing.</p>

            <p>The general idea for that mini item was to have an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edit_distance">edit distance</a> of 3 or more from the correct spelling. I phrased it like that so I wouldn't have to explain what edit distance was. "St. Hermelin" to "St. Merlin" has that property, so it counts.</p>

            <p>The only fandom news I can really think of right now happens to be in the fandoms of Wolfenstein (TNO to be specific) and Camp Camp (which is also periodically offensive), hence why I call it &quot;driving hS nuts as usual&quot; news.<br><br>In the Wolfenstein fandom, we recently got a trailer for &quot;Wolfenstein: The New Colossus&quot;, a sequel to Wolfenstein: The New Order. You can find the trailer and the trailer for The Old Blood (a prequel to The New Order) on the front page of the Wolfenstein wiki, link below my signature. If you&#39;re curious as to what this new strain of Wolfenstein games is about, well... just click the link. I don&#39;t feel like I&#39;m entirely safe to describe it here.<br><br>As for Camp Camp, the Season 2 finale premiered 2 days ago, and we learned a lot of characters&#39; backstories. I won&#39;t give the exact details in case there are any Camp Camp fans out there, but the fandom has definitely shown an increase in activity as of that episode. After the finale, there will apparently be two minor episodes before either a new season or the end of the show occurs (I don&#39;t know which.)<br><br>So! Hope y&#39;all find my news useful. I don&#39;t have anything else to say.

            <p>I never objected to the fact that you play the Wolfenstein games, or that they feature Hitler (heck, <i>Iron Sky</i> was one of my favourite films of the year it came out); I objected to the part where you made Hitler a literal god in the Plort setting.

            <p>my past experience with Europeans in general, and how terribly short and triggered-sounding your replies were to that incident. Since you suddenly jumped on me with disciplinary posts that left me thinking &quot;Huh?

            <p>Either way, I was kind of distrustful of you up until the pancake/Force/lightsaber fight, and despite your still-triggered-sounding annoyance at my thoughts of possible bandom and Neshomeh&#39;s reassurances (thanks, Nesh), I was still ready to be an outcast. I even had an idea for a sci-fi themed parallel to the PPC, which then luckily turned into a harmless story that I think will be pretty cool once it&#39;s done. The weird lightsaber fight thing with cosplay is actually kind of helping me trust you again, so well, thanks for engaging me in the weirdest RP fight I&#39;ve ever been in.

            <p>I&#39;m really glad we could get this worked out. Nice fic, by the way.<br><br>Speaking of, I had an idea for another PPC AU, this one superhero-themed. I call it &quot;The Protectors of Plotropolis&quot;! Agents are superheroes, Boarders are part of a SHIELD-like organization that manages the superheroes, and the Mary Sues are supervillains. Sound cool? Any ideas?<br><br>For the news, oh hoho, I&#39;m going to have fun with this! Well, Camp Camp is about a bunch of kids (mostly aged 10) at a weird summer camp that&#39;s actually a scam. The adult cartoon is produced by Rooster Teeth, who also created RWBY and Halo: Red Vs Blue. (Not the exact same people, though. Different teams, different projects.) It gets kind of offensive in a fun way at times, and there is a character who was created to be a walking Hitler joke. (He&#39;s actually not quite as bad as that makes him sound, and in fact he is really adorable, which is why he&#39;s my favorite.) There&#39;s a Camp Camp Wikia if you wish to read more. As for Wolfenstein, particularly Wolfenstein 3D, I&#39;ve been using an online emulator at wolf3d.atw.hu if you want to give it a try. It&#39;s pretty fun.<br><br>-Twistey</p>

            <p>Namely for the Half-Life fandom. <br><br>Today, almost ten years after <i>Half-Life 2: Episode 2</i> was released, Marc Laidlaw wrote what he calls a peice of fanfiction. However, Laidlaw was one of the head writers for the Half-Life series. This &quot;fanfiction&quot; is a proposed plot for the fabled <i>Half-Life 2: Episode 3.</i><br><br>It should be noted, this is not strictly &quot;canon.&quot; At the end of the day, only Valve has the ability to give us that. However, it has become increasingly clear over the decade since the last installment, Valve is not actively working on the next entry in the series. Marc Laidlaw left Valve eighteen months ago, and from this proposed plot, we can guess why. Valve is not working on any games that require a head writer. There is no Episode Three. There never will be an Episode Three. This is the closure to the story that fans have been longing for these many years. At least, as close to &quot;official&quot; closure as we will ever get.<br><br>There are two versions of this plot. On Marc&#39;s website, you can read <a href="http://www.marclaidlaw.com/epistle-3/">Epistle 3</a> However, to avoid potential legal action from Valve, he changed the names and pronouns of several characters. While you can fairly easally tell who everybody is supposed to be, fans have gone ahead and changed the proper nouns back to their canon counterparts. You can read that <a href="https://github.com/Jackathan/MarcLaidlaw-Epistle3/blob/master/Epistle3_Corrected.md">Here.</a></p>

            <p>but you really <i>did</i> do a good job replicating those old horrendous, incoherent scriptfic thingies. You did a really good job of <i>parodying</i> them, too - how Kitty sort of, overrides the whole thing, starts exploiting the scriptiness of it to her own needs. Agents exploiting the fic and medium and all has a sort of, fine line between being contrived and, er, not being contrived, but you built up to it and delivered it properly enough it wasn&#39;t, I&#39;d say! <br><br>Bloody, excited to see you expand more on the Team Phoenix fellows, too! </p>

            <p>The sheer incoherency of the &#39;fic&#39; feels exactly like the old author&#39;s notes you used to see around - the ones where the author argues with their muses/kidnaps canon characters/is worshipped by said canons/etc. I&#39;m not sure I&#39;ve ever seen a fic that was this A/N-y all the way through, but they&#39;re out there, for sure.<br><br>My one issue with it is that I&#39;ve never heard anything about any of the four canons, so I don&#39;t have the faintest idea who these people are.

            <p>Heh heh.  Heh heh.  Heh.  Okay.<br><br>I assumed every Team Phoenix member was getting their own recruitment story, so I was not expecting this.  The silly and gross-out nature of the fic, as well as Kitty&#39;s admission that she&#39;s only been acting mature, make this feel like a proper punchline of the trilogy.<br><br>The script format is . . . hard to read, but I&#39;m sure that was part of your intention.  I am actually a little disappointed we don&#39;t get a proper glimpse of each Bean character&#39;s world, since I&#39;ve never seen any of those movies, and the not-Boromir-and-Alec members have always been more background in your stories.  Hopefully we&#39;ll learn more about their settings as the team forms in the next entry?<br><br>One purely curious question: When Kitty says, &quot;for the love of Iau,&quot; is Iau a Zelda- or <i>Yu-Gi-Oh!</i>-verse deity?<br><br>—doctorlit has totally assumed for years that Kitty had actual cat ears based on her picture on the wiki, so he&#39;s really glad you included that line about the headband, but also really embarrassed</p>

            <p>The rest of the team are going to get more fleshed out, don&#39;t worry!

            <p>I bet it wouldn&#39;t be too hard to invent a surrealist game from Voynich.<br><br>Okay, ground rule: you can only use things found on the manuscript itself. No English text, no numbers. Pages are numbered as per <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voynich_manuscript">the Wikipedia table</a> (at the bottom of the Description section; you need to expand it if you&#39;re on a desktop PC.)<br><br><a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6a/Voynich_Manuscript_%28158%29.jpg">158</a> is your world map. Nine zones, which can be moved between via the links. The mountains extending out from the corner zones are Cluedo-like passages, leading to the opposite corners.<br><br>The Herbal section (most of the book, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Voynich_Manuscript_(174).jpg">example</a> which appears to be Silphium) and the Pharmaceutical (161-165, 175-182, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Voynich_Manuscript_(177).jpg">example</a>) are obviously the core of the game. The goal is to collect enough Herbal cards which look vaguely like those on one of the five Pharmaceutical cards shown face-up to make that potion.<br><br>The Zodiac pages (128-134, <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ec/Voynich_Manuscript_%28134%29.jpg">example</a>) are your character cards. The &#39;nymphs&#39; around your player are what you have to treat with the potions; the number you&#39;ve managed to treat determines what you can do with...<br><br>The Biological section (135-154, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Voynich_Manuscript_(135).jpg">example</a>. These are blocks you can throw in the way of your opponents; the trick is that you need to have treated (on your Zodiac card) the number of &#39;nymphs&#39; in the Biological card in order to use it. Every player has a full set of Biological cards; once deployed, they stay on the board until broken past. You can deploy one per turn.<br><br>The Astronomical (122-124, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voynich_manuscript#/media/File:Voynich_Manuscript_(123).jpg">example</a>) and Cosmological (125-127, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voynich_manuscript#/media/File:Voynich_Manuscript_(156).jpg">156</a>, 157) sections are what you use to break past the Biological/Nymph sections. If blocked by one (that isn&#39;t your own colour), you draw an Astro card. You then use the words/letters printed on the Herbal cards in your hand to try and spell at least three words on the Astro card. If you succeed, congrats! You break the Biological and get past.<br><br>You pick up five Herbals every time you step into a new zone on the board. Your goal is to have all of your opponents pinned between two of your Biological cards, while you stand in the central section.<br><br>As for the final Recipe section (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voynich_manuscript#/media/File:Voynich_Manuscript_(183).jpg">183</a>-205)? That&#39;s the purported rules. You hand them to new players and say &#39;make sure you read them thoroughly before we start&#39;. :D The actual rules are conveyed purely through word-of-mouth.<br><br>So, whaddaya think? Playable?<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>But playing the original requires a) the actual Voynich manuscript, and b) a gaming group made up of Francis Bacon, J.R.R. Tolkien, and Hildegard of Bingen. While that is admittedly the best gaming group ever listed, it&#39;s not very feasible, so we&#39;ll make some simplified cards and play Junior Voynich.<br><br>(I did indeed get the reference, and checked explainxkcd to see if anyone had done the invention part before me.

Add to that the litany of spelling and grammar errors and, well, it&#39;s beyond saving.</p>

            <p>Do you have a little free time? Feel like betaing an interlude about a Vulcan and a human on a DOGA mission? Try this interlude! Only nine pages long, minimal canon knowledge necessary (though knowing a bit about Vulcans would be useful), and--<br><br>*drops announcer voice* Yeah, I don&#39;t have a third thing. However, I do have this interlude!<br><br>I&#39;m mainly looking for betas for wording/SPaG and story flow. There&#39;s a little bit of editing left to do (word choice, primarily), and other than that I&#39;d really like another pair of eyes or two (or three! Three is also good).<br><br>As mentioned, the interlude will probably make more sense with a bit of knowledge about Vulcans (nothing too detailed, just the basics of who they are and some of the things they can do). It&#39;s primarily a character piece, so an eye toward consistent characterization would also be helpful.<br><br>Any takers?<br><br>~Z</p>

            <p>Hi, I&#39;m Blackwing (obviously!), and I think this whole fanfiction thing is pretty cool! I haven&#39;t ever written any, but I really enjoy reading them. So far my favorite fandoms for stories are Steven Universe, Dresden Files, Dragon Age, and Mass Effect.<br><br>I was honestly just gonna lurk for another week or two until I got a feeling for you guys, but a friend linked me to something I thought you guys would enjoy. So, I&#39;m sure people here have heard of the whole fiasco with the Handbook for Mortals YA novel (which among other things, has no YA protagonists), and the theory that it was written by the infamous author of My Immortal? Well, she revived her old fictionpress account just to debunk that myth! Also to say thanks for keeping her story alive this long, etc. You can see that here: <a href="https://www.fictionpress.com/u/518933/XXXblodyblaktearz666XXX"><a href="https://www.fictionpress.com/u/518933/XXXblodyblaktearz666XXX">https://www.fictionpress.com/u/518933/XXXblodyblaktearz666XXX</a></a></p>

            <p>(Or maybe not Pikachu. Probably a Ghost, Poison, Dark, or Steel type instead. I like that vibe they have.)<br><br>Hey there! I&#39;m Twistey, an uberchaotic neutral lightly-used-bie who is pretty good most of the time and then occasionally does something unexpected, shocking, and kinda stupid. Yeah... probably shouldn&#39;t put that on my introduction to the newbie. But hey, it&#39;s a good warning. My fandoms are very many: when it&#39;s got good world-building and/or it&#39;s a tad bit offensive in a fun way, or when it&#39;s completely worthy of mocking or I have something to MST about it, you can bet I&#39;ll have made at least one OC for it.<br><br>Interesting news you bring about the My Immortal author! Judging by the post she made, she has definitely cleaned up her act, which I applaud. Maybe somebody should take advantage of that Tumblr account she has to send her the sporking we did of My Immortal - she might find it humorous.<br><br>As for your newbie gift, hmm, let&#39;s see. Here, have several large pieces of naturally sky-blue metal, only found in and around the Wolfenstein 3D fandom. Do whatever you want with them. Make a cool contraption. Make art. Use your imagination! :D<br><br>Anyway, nice to meet you! I hope you find us great and have a good time as a Protector of the Plot Continuum!<br><br>-Twistey</p>

So that&#39;s good. Here, take a Bolter and a flask of Fenrisian Ale.<br><br>I too enjoy The Dresden Files, although I haven&#39;t read any good fanfic in that universe (got any recommendations?). Anyways, go read goodfic (For PPC stuff, I suggest starting with TOS and Tales From DOGA), and be sure to stop by the Discord. Don&#39;t worry: We don&#39;t bite. Unless you poke us.</p>

            <p>Welcome aBoard! Have this plate of freshly-made SPaGhetti!<br><br>If you haven&#39;t yet read them, may I point you towards <a href="http://plotprotectors.tripod.com/TOS/">the Original Series</a> and <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=18hztHpDehxcfrjaXoFUew1vb0BdZPDAusHxMHzHiCzM">the Constitution</a>? They&#39;re pretty much the only required reading around these parts. Another useful resource you might use is <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/PPC_Wiki&lt;br%20/&gt;">the Wiki</a>; if you have any questions, just look here before asking. We like it when newbies do the research. ;)<br><br>Hope you decide to stick around!</p>

            <p>Welcome, welcome! You get a history of my dog&#39;s past lives. Treasure it, use it wisely, use it as part of a stepladder, whatever. Just don&#39;t let it come into contact with badgers. You&#39;ve been warned.</p>
