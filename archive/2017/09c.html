            <p>Was playing 2-Headed-Giant (basically 2v2 games) with a friend. Some notable moments:<br>*Way too many jokes about getting Arcane Adaptation for all of our rares.<br>*We both ended up pulling Deadeye Tracker for our prerelease cards.<br>*I opened a Vraska and an Axis of Immortality. My friend didn&#39;t pull any mythics.<br>*We won our first game by dealing 10 points of damage with a tag-team Bishop of the Bloodstained and an Unfriendly Fire.<br>*We lost our next two games pretty badly. I blame lukewarm draws.<br>*We got a bye on our last game, so we ended up &quot;playing&quot; against another team that got a bye. We were all sleep-deprived at that point, so you can imagine how that went.<br>*Trying to figure out how to split the cards we opened. While we were tired. Fun times.</p>

            <p>Got to Germany a few weeks ago to start on my semester of doing research, and since then I&#39;ve ... done some research. Most of what I&#39;ve gotten up to was on the project I had started last semester, which has good results now, but the things I specifically came here for are starting up now that all the relevant people are back from traveling. <br><br>On top of that, I&#39;m getting hit with all the stuff that goes along with applying to PhD programs.

            <p>So, those of you familiar with the basics of Two Truths and a Lie know how it goes: Post two truths and a lie, and responders have to find the lie.<br><br>Now, let&#39;s do it with badfic excerpts! Post two real excerpts (nothing NSFW), and one you made up yourself. People respond to your post by trying to guess which one is the fake!<br><br>For example!<br><br>1) &quot;Your daughter will be known for every wizards and witches from now on. She will be remembered as the girl who defeated Lord Voldemort when she was mere child just like Harry. She will be more famous than Harry seeing that she stopped Voldemort first and weakened him. She will be powerful than normal witch with two most important family bloods run in her veins. She will be a powerful veela just like you and your family. And she will always be remembered as the Girl Who Lived.&quot;<br><br>2) Astrid&#39;s eyes were blue, the brightest blue of sapphires in a riverbed, and her hair was silver like the moon. It was a mark of the curse she bore; ever since the night her parents died and left her at the orphanage where she was an outcast. Nobody there wanted to be friends with her, but if they knew she was the princess of the wizarding world and heir to the most important pureblood family in the world, the Bellagios, they would treat her better.<br><br>3) It was now my turn to tell him a little bit about myself so I did and said &quot; I&#39;m a 4th year too but I&#39;m kind of a new student ,I love to read and I&#39;m also scared of spiders .&quot; He then smiled and said &quot; That&#39;s pretty cool never met a girl who is scared of spiders like I am .&quot; I giggled when I said &quot; Now you do &quot; He couldn&#39;t help but smile and laugh then he asked &quot; Do you have any siblings ?&quot; I then replied &quot;Nope I&#39;m just an only child.&quot; I explained to him.<br><br>Which one did I make up, and which ones are real? Let&#39;s see what you come up with.</p>

Whatcha doin&#39;?&quot; said Pinkie<br><br>&quot;Trying to turn that apple into an Orange.&quot; said Twilight<br><br>&quot;But you kind of threw her aim off.&quot; said spike as they see a orange with wings flying pass them &quot;Well they don&#39;t call them flying oranges for nothing&quot; Ash said in the humor but sees the flying orange ridiculous &quot;Ash I got your side set for you to start practicing your alicorn magic&quot; Twilight shows Ash an strawberry &quot;So I need to turn that strawberry to something?&quot; said Ash<br><br>&quot;Yes Ash you need to change it to a kiwi&quot; said spike<br><br>&quot;I can do that&quot; said Ash<br><br>----------<br><br>2) &quot;Your skin... It sprakles!&quot; I gasped.<br><br>Violet looked down at her foream, turning her hand over and over. It was indeed true; her skin seemd to glisten like a million diamonds had been embedded into her skin. She stepped away from the ray of sunlight, her expression sullen.<br><br>&quot;You cann&#39;t be near me, Wilbur, it&#39;s too dangerous,&quot; she said. &quot;I could kill you. The possibility really is there. You could vanish one night, without a trace, and nobody would eer know hwere you went. The only trace of your fate would be hte blood on my fangs!&quot;<br><br>&quot;It&#39;s a risk I&#39;m willng to take,&quot; I replied, my eyes taking a look of stely determination. &quot;Violet, I... I always wanted to tell you this... You&#39;re BEAUTIFUL.&quot;<br><br>Her eyes widened. &quot;...I am??&quot;<br><br>&quot;You&#39;ve always been beautiful, Vi.&quot; A warm smile on my face &quot;And being av ampire doesn&#39;t change that at all.&quot;<br><br>----------<br><br>3) Harry finished eating the man that had shot him, he could smell the others that dared come to his island. He quickly got to the odd, white object and growled. He quietly got close to the object and smelled it, yes the intruders were inside of the thing. Harry smashed his right clawed hand into the thing&#39;s side, his claws sinking into the &#39;skin&#39; of the object without any resistance. He then sank his other hand into the other side of the thing and then started pulling, the object making a ripping sound before it fell off, landing with a crash to the forest floor.<br><br>His targets were staring at him with fear, yes, he was the alpha predator here! He looked over all of the humans until his eyes came across one with red hair and bright emerald green eyes, he knew her. A memory flashed in his mind, that woman was holding him in her arms and was smiling at him. Roaring in pain as the memory hurt his mind so much, like his skull was being attacked by the vicious claw of the raptors! Harry angrily roared at the woman and lunged forward, attempting to snap at her legs.<br><br>He got a man instead, Harry dropped him and as he tried to crawl away, he stepped on his legs before tearing him in half. He ate the man before he used his powers to slash the tree down, making the object roll away, he gave chase. That woman would die, somehow she had hurt him, the greatest predator of the island! The pathetic humans had run out of the safety of the object before returning to it, attempting to hide. Well, he thought, I&#39;ll make sure they don&#39;t escape.<br><br>----------<br><br>Which one is the fake? Take your pick! :D<br><br>-SS</p>

            <p>All of these scream like something you&#39;d write, and it&#39;s perfectly in the realm of possibility that you did, knowing your past record. Doing some light research, I&#39;m assuming #1 is Pokémon and My Little Pony, #2 is a Mega-Crossover involving Incredibles, Meet The Robinsons, and Twilight, with some crossover ships thrown in the mix... one that&#39;s apparently surprisingly common, and the last one is a Harry Potter and Jurrasic Park crossover... one that involves Harry becoming a Dinosaur...<br><br>Jesus Christ you&#39;re not making this easy, but if I had to choose I&#39;d go with #2 for the simple fact that I can&#39;t find anything directly relating to it on The Pit or AO3</p>

            <p>...your answer was CORRECT! :D<br><br>Both #1 and #3 were right on the money, respectively featuring Ash becoming an alicorn (yes, really) and Harry being an animagus who could turn into the Spinosaurus from JP3 (yes, really). Both of them also involved inserting the crossover elements into one of the continua featured in their respective stories, with Alicorn!Ash being shoehorned into the episodes of MLP Season 3, and Spino!Harry actually BEING the JP3 Spino. Yeah, I cringed so much at both and I&#39;m considering adding the one with Spino!Harry to the Unclaimed list if I get the time.<br><br>The &quot;excerpt&quot; with vampire!Violet and Wilbur was painful for me to write, but the first two things that came to mind when I thought about what to pull out of my butt were the Willet crossover ship and the fact that the Twilight saga used to be one of the most widely known and polarizing continua back in the day. Violet being a vampire is an AU I&#39;ve seen on some thankfully rare few occasions while perusing DeviantArt, and my original intent was for her to be frightened by her being a vampire due to a recent transformation but her being a vamp from the get-go sounded weirder for my taste.<br><br>Also, how dare you accuse me of actually WANTING to write crossovers as weird and twisted as what I presented, lol. I doubt even I would consider it... especially not after the LAST time I tried it. X&#39;D</p>

            <p>Three uncanonical <i>Harry Potter</i> spawns:<br><br><br>1) It took all the Slytherin Prince had not to kick Potter as he looked up at him from the dust of the graveyard.  &quot;Not so cocky now are you Potter?&quot;  He said sneering.<br><br>&quot;Not so cocky indeed.&quot; Said Vodemort.  He was finally finished regenerating.  &quot;You have done well Draco.&quot;  He walked over to Potter.  His black cloak swirled elegantly around him.  &quot;You were the chosen one mr Potter.&quot; He said.  &quot;And now you will die.&quot;  He pointed his wand at Harry and used the killing curse.  &quot;Now Draco my son it is time to begin.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yes father.&quot; Malfoy said.  His silver eyes shone with devotion.  Finally after all this time pretending to be a weakling and a coward he would finally take his place at his father&#39;s side.<br><br>Voldemort took out his wand and pressed it against his Dark Mark.  &quot;Come to me my death eaters.&quot;  And they were there the graveyard.  Dolahov and Snape.  Malfoy and Greyback.  And all the rest.  &quot;My friends it is good to see you.&quot; He said.  &quot;It is time for us to step out from the shadows.&quot;<br><br>&quot;My lord we will do as you say.&quot; They said.<br><br>Voldemort put a firm white hand on Malfoy&#39;s shoulder.  &quot;And my son shall lead you.&quot;<br><br>The Prince smirked.  He was going to make them pay.  Granger, Weasley and everyone who had mocked him would all pay.<br><br><br>2) A beautiful baby girl was born to two loving parents within the Snape family: Severus and Jaquiline. Both were of pureblooded origins, making the little girl pureblooded as well.<br><br>With curly black hair, deep blue eyes, and pale skin, her parents thought her perfect. Her godparents thought the same, as did her best friend (once he was old enough to understand, that is). Everyone who met her was simply enchanted, though she had no control over this.<br><br>Betrothal contracts were begged of Severus Snape, but he refused. If his daughter was to marry, it would be for love- as long as her suitor was pure blooded.<br><br>Now, the Snape family (which is one of the oldest when it comes to being pureblood) was also of mythical descent; that is to say, of sirenic descent. The song and beauty of the sirens ran through their veins. Their song was enchanting and caught attention of all. Their voice was a power of theirs, but it was not the most important. What was the most important, you ask? One word.<br><br>Love.<br><br><br>3) Harry&#39;s jaw dropped at the sight of her. She looked Harry&#39;s age and had long flaming red hair, matted with blood and water and hazel eyes filled with tears. Her clothes were wet and torn and covered in dirt from the storm, and her face was stained with water droplets, blood, and dirt. Needless to say, she did look like Lily Potter. Except for her eyes. Her eyes were the exact same color as James Potter. Wait...no...her eyes changed. They went from hazel to green, back to hazel.<br><br>Professor McGonagall moved Harry&#39;s hand to look at his scar while Professor Snape took the Lily Potter look-alike&#39;s wrist. &quot;Bloody hell.&quot; Snape muttered. Everyone crowded around to look at her wrist. It was the same lightning shaped scar that Harry had on his forehead.<br><br>&quot;What&#39;s your name dear?&quot; Professor McGonagall asked.<br><br>&quot;Ph-Phoenix.&quot; She said softly.<br><br>&quot;Your full name, please.&quot; Professor Dumbledore stated kindly.<br><br>She took a deep breath, &quot;Phoenix Minerva Potter.&quot;<br><br><br>Which one&#39;s the fake? (Trick question; they all are! {= D )<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <h1>1 is the fake. I actually had Phobos come up with it so it wouldn&#39;t seem like something I&#39;d think of, but then I tweaked it to add more detail, trying to make it feel more like something someone put all their feelings into, like the other ones, and apparently that was a mistake.<br><br>But yeah, two and three are fun. They&#39;re from Quotev, and are respectively &quot;<a href="https://www.quotev.com/story/9380221/Love-in-the-Dark">Love in the Dark</a>&quot; and &quot;<a href="https://www.quotev.com/story/9836730/The-Second-Potter">The Second Potter</a>.&quot; I haven&#39;t read much of &quot;The Second Potter,&quot; but &quot;Love in the Dark&quot; features one Mikaela Snape and is pretty dang funny. The fic seems to be mainly a retelling of the books, only with her shoehorned into half the canon events. Meanwhile, she can&#39;t make up her mind whether she wants to be a good guy or not. Half the time she&#39;s being nice to Harry and friends, the other half she&#39;s helping Draco torture Neville and then going out and spending loads of money on fancy rings for her BFF and future love interest. Because eleven-year-old Draco is all about fancy rings and not, say, racing brooms. And also Snape calls her Flower. *snort*<br><br>I <i>might</i> claim that one. The fic has a soundtrack I can use to torture Derik. Could be fun.<br><br>~Neshomeh</h1>

            <p>So guess what fandom I&#39;m doing?<br><br>Also, because I&#39;m an especial jerk, below are two real badfic excerpts, one made up by me, and one passage from Stephen King&#39;s actual <i>It</i> novel.  Make your guess!<br>-----<br>1. He stared at you for a moment, smile fading.<br><br>“What? I thought we were having fun?”<br><br>“You made me fall! My [butt] is wet now! I told you to be gentle if we did this.”<br><br>Pennywise frowned then, extending a hand to you which you accepted. He pulled you to your feet. He brushed your wild hair out of your face, cupping your cheeks with one gigantic hand.<br>-----<br>2. He felt as if someone had whopped all the breath out of him . . . and then he heard that sound again, that sound that was half pressure on the skin and eardrums, that keen homicidal whispering rush—<i>Swiipppp!</i>  He rolled off the bench onto the gravel, thinking <i>So this is what they mean by</i> déja-vu<i>, now you know, you&#39;ll never have to ask anybody again—</i><br><br>He hit on his shoulder and rolled, looking up at the Paul Bunyan statue—only it was no longer Paul Bunyan.  The clown stood there instead, resplendent and evident, fantastic in plastic, twenty feet of Day-Glo colors, its painted face surmounting a cosmic comic ruff.  Orange pompom buttons cast in plastic, each as big as a volleyball, ran down the front of the silvery suit.  Instead of an axe it held a huge bunch of plastic balloons.  Engraved on each were two legends: IT&#39;S STILL ROCK AND ROLL TO ME and RICHIE TOZIER&#39;S &quot;ALL DEAD&quot; ROCK SHOW.<br><br>He scrambled backward, using his heels and his palms.  Gravel went down the back of his pants.  He heard a seam tear loose in the underarm of his Rodeo Drive sportcoat.  He rolled over, gained his feet, staggered, looked back.  The clown looked down at him.  Its eyes rolled wetly in their sockets.<br><br>&quot;Did I give you a scare, m&#39;man?&quot; it rumbled.<br>-----<br>3. It had learned, early on, that adults were more difficult to feed on.<br><br>Mind, there were <i>no</i> limits on what It could do.  Rather than limiting, being in a space with only three dimensions essentially gave It endless room for change: manipulation, transformation, even rewritng the minds and memories of Its prey.<br><br>So while It was certainly capapble of transforming into, say, the fear of looming bills or the threat of divorce, there was something so much more visceral about the more overt fears of children.<br><br>If nothing else, the forms of childrens&#39; fears made it easier to retain teeth.<br>-----<br>4. But The Bat didn&#39;t get far as something grabbed him from behind and threw him back into the open spot where he crashed. Batman jumped and threw several batwings at a wide angle but his enemy was nowhere to be seen.<br><br>&quot;I/we waited so long for you, Bat-Man...Man-Bat...I/we expected more from you. You used to be such a worthy opponent.&quot;, mocked The Joker from the dark.<br><br>&quot;Pennywise! Joker! Show yourself!&quot;, Batman shouted as he tensed up, ready for the attack.<br><br>—doctorlit is his own Loser&#39;s Club</p>

            <p>I&#39;m pretty sure #2 is the real excerpt from the book. I haven&#39;t read it myself, but I&#39;ve read enough Stephen King that I think I can recognize his style.

            <p>There are a few short chapters from Its perspective in <i>It</i>, which I won&#39;t quote because my fingers have cheese grease on them.  But yeah, It basically looks down on humans like really stupid cattle.  If It is capable of love, It certainly wouldn&#39;t consider love with a human.<br><br>—it&#39;s also really hard for doctorlit to hold that brick-shaped book open and type at the same time, so</p>

            <p>1) &quot;Yes, its true.&quot; I said looking away in embarrassment. &quot;I am The Lost Olympian.&quot;<br><br>Annabeth gasped &quot;But that&#39;s impossible! Selene disappeared over ten thousand years ago and your only sixteen! And Percy&#39;s sister!&quot;<br><br>&quot;I was reborn as Percy&#39;s sister&quot; I said softly. &quot;I needed to fulfil the Prophecy.&quot; I recited:<br><br><i>Daughter of Moon and Daughter of Night<br>Comes into the world a mortal to fight<br>With Sea and Wit she sails alone<br>Until one day she comes back home</i><br><br>&quot;I didn&#39;t know about it until now&quot; I said. &quot;Please don&#39;t hate me.&quot;<br><br>Annabeth hugged me. &quot;I could never hate you.&quot;<br><br>2) &quot;There must be some mistake, my Lady would never have a child, let alone a son&quot; snapped the girl who had been talking to Chiron.<br><br>&quot;There is no mistake, Ms Nightshade, the symbol was Artemis claiming her child, I was informed earlier today that Percy was her son&quot; corrected Chiron as he came over just in case she attacked him in some way.<br><br>3) My name is Penny Jackson,daughter of Poseidon. And I&#39;m immortal.<br><br>Wanna know how? After the defeat of Kronos,the gods offered immortality to Percy,but he refused for Annabeth. Cute right? So they gave the immortality to me. It has upsides,and downsides.<br><br>The good thing is I won&#39;t die. But turns out,it&#39;s actually possible for immortals to die,and since I&#39;m just a junior or whatever,my immortality isn&#39;t that strong. So,it&#39;s kinda like the Hunters of Artemis thing. If I don&#39;t get hurt,I&#39;ll be fine.</p>

            <p>1) I didn&#39;t know what to think. Both Draco and Harry wanted me? But I was just an ordinary, plain girl with long, flowing black hair and silver eyes. Why was I so special that the hottest boys in school were about to start hexing each other over me?<br><br>2) &quot;Are you going to believe me without Veritaserum?&quot;<br><br>&quot;We&#39;ll see. Start talking.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Okay, well first off, I really am Harry Potter…but I&#39;m not four years old. I&#39;m actually seventeen. When I was one year old…&quot;<br><br>3) I was so happy with my new job. My father wasn&#39;t as pleased as I, probably because he rather see me working at the Ministry of Magic than Hogwarts but I didn&#39;t care which one were more important. I only had space in my heart for one place and it was the school of magic. Also, Albus Dumbledore came to my house in London personally to offer the job. Who - in their right mind - would refuse such an invitation? Think I said yes with my mouth fulled of my mother&#39;s (delicious!) toasts with smoked salmon when the director asked me during brunch - he didn&#39;t seem to mind my behavior and noticed how grateful I was. Since the day he visit &#39;til the day I had to leave home the anxiety took over me completly. I was eating like a pig with pms, even chocolat started to taste like water after a while - and I couldn&#39;t hear that word anymore or I would vomite. When I had everything with me I was ready to go take the train. My father, one grumpy slytherin, kissed my forehead. My mother, a lovely gryffindor, hugged me until there was no more oxigen in my lungs.</p>

            <p>1) Sigyn Faye Anasta stood outside by the park outside of London. She knew it was a matter of time before she was truly hunted for what she was. She was the last of the true immortals. Yes, there was other out there but they were all tainted by the other two immortals, vampires and werewolves. Until there was a way to cure them there was no hope with their blood. The wind blew moving her blonde hair across her face. Her blue eyes locked with the nearly full moon. Her father died when she was in Hogwarts and that was centuries ago. Her mother died in child birth with her during a total solar eclipse. But she looked like she was in her mid-twenties. A scent caught her attention she had many traits of her fellow immortals. A heightened sense of smell and sight were just a few.<br><br>2) I grabbed an arrow from my quiver and load it on to my bow, I leaped to the front while at the same time turned my body to face the beast, and simultaneously released the strings of my bow and let the arrow fly towards the giant&#39;s head. I did my best attempt of an &quot;<i>action movie style archery</i>&quot; and shoot my arrow right to his head. And guess what folks? I f***ing did it! Well, only the whole &quot;<i>action movie style archery</i>&quot; part that is, it turned out my arrow just bounced off his skin.<br><br>3) &quot;How could you, Ruby!?&quot; I screamed, hearing Ruby&#39;s hurtful words. The pain in my chest was unbearable, and not only because of the Beowulf&#39;s claws. I loved her. She was the only anchor I had in this unfair world. She was everything to me! And now? It was all over. <br>&quot;I&#39;m one of them now! You know it, Yang knows it, everybody else will know, too! I&#39;m gonna become half-Grimm!&quot;<br></p>

            <p>I think the first one is real because it would be the most difficult style to affect deliberately. Reads like someone whose first language is not English as well as not knowing where to draw the line between narrative and author&#39;s note.<br><br>The second one could be fake because it&#39;s a bunch of Suvian cliches without any obvious writing tics (other than an improper semicolon), easy enough to fake, but that one specific detail about the family name gives me pause. Why Bellagio? Seems like something that could have specific importance to the author—but then again, it could be something randomly pulled out of nowhere. Or both!<br><br>The third one could be fake because it reminds me of &quot;The Girl and Her Dragon,&quot; and I can totally see Iximaz pulling that off. It&#39;s not quite the same tic, though, since there are actual sentences here, even if they are improperly run together in a single paragraph. The weird spacing around the punctuation is another thing I feel like I&#39;ve seen somewhere before. It could be a deliberate recombination of different problems, or it could just be terrible writing.<br><br>Hmmm.<br><br>I&#39;m gonna go with the second one being the fake.

            <p>Aaaaand we&#39;re back. I&#39;ve actually paid attention to the news this week, so you get rather an excessive number of items -- yay? (As usual, the images are not important parts of the post - they&#39;re just here to add a bit of colour.)<br><br>Please remember that, when it comes to the state of the world, not everyone will agree with you.

For the first time in over a decade, there is a new <i>Star Trek</i> series on TV. <i>Star Trek: Discovery</i> has launched. If you&#39;re anywhere other than the US, you can probably get it on Netflix; in the US, you&#39;re supposed to buy into CBS All Access, which sounds like a great way to waste money.<br><br>Kaitlyn and I watched the first two episodes, and will be watching the third. The first episode feels more <i>Wars</i> than <i>Trek</i>, but the second episode gets a bit more into the groove. It&#39;s no spoiler to say that the show taps into the long and honourable school of psychopathic Vulcans - the &#39;shoot first, never ask questions because logic dictates that it was the right thing to do&#39; style exemplified by <i>Voyager</i>&#39;s Tuvok is alive and well here. Also there are Klingons (and long speeches in Klingon, which are unfortunately delivered... like...

Generation Z reported only 66% &#39;only attracted to the opposite sex&#39;, while the older generations (Millennial/Y, X, and Baby Boom) came in at 71%, 85%, and 88%. Most of the difference seems to be down to a breaking of the binary &#39;straight/gay&#39; definition: 26% of Generation Z reported that they were either equally attracted to both sexes (9%), or &#39;mostly&#39; (rather than &#39;only&#39;) to the opposite (9%) or same (3%).

            <p>Yeah, I don&#39;t buy the story either. Writing a trollfic to find her brother? How could anyone even possibly believe that would work, seriously? Yeah, no. Even if it were actually coming from the real author of the fic instead of some random fangirl, it&#39;s still a terrible excuse. And the whole &quot;Native American and put in foster care&quot; thing, while definitely possible in real life on its own, sounds like the premise of a movie when you compare it to the supposed results. It sounds really contrived, a little bit appropriation-y, and overall just plain suspicious. Much like a bad fanfiction.<br><br>I have a feeling that the real author of My Immortal, whoever she is, probably doesn&#39;t want to reveal her actual identity. Given how logical and grown-up she seems to have become now from looking at the post she wrote saying that she didn&#39;t write Handbook for Mortals, she probably decided that letting the world know isn&#39;t worth the huge influx of random crud people would send to her. A very wise choice indeed.<br><br>-Twistey</p>

            <p>The person who doxxed her is the same one who claimed to be her brother, but the only proof he offered was stuff you can get from a Google search. The forum he made this claim on is known for attacking women and minorities and Rose Christo basically the perfect target for them. The &quot;fact checking&quot; she failed, according to the EW article on the subject,is apparently that she changed names to preserve anonymity. Also, beyond some jerk&#39;s say-so, there is no proof she was lying about anything. Like, why ia no one seemingly willing to question his story th way they har hers?</p>

            <p>I&#39;m pretty sure Helmwraith directly contradicts <i>the movies</i>, let alone the books. Remember the &#39;Tomb of the Nazgul&#39; in <i>Desolation of Smaug</i>? They claimed the Nine were buried there after the fall of Angmar, in 1935 - around the time the last king of Gondor died. But Rohan wasn&#39;t even founded until 2510, and Helm died in 2759. Helmwraith would have had to be buried eight hundred years before his death.<br><br>Or maybe the claim is that the Nazgul keep being killed off and replaced? But that&#39;s... dumb. And anyway, Isilgul has an even bigger problem: Sauron was <i>gone</i> at the time when he needed to place a ring on Isildur&#39;s finger. That&#39;s literally the whole point.<br><br>I am annoyed.

            <p>Did anyone know that Iron Sky has a website? Some of you probably did, but I only recently discovered it, and am very excited to begin exploring once I get over my chicken-ness and start. All I know is it&#39;s got a Flash thing on the main page, so it&#39;s probably interactive to some degree. Probably also was made to promote the upcoming second movie (which will ironically enough be released in 2018, and if you remember the Friday Forum segment hS did on it, will involve Hitler riding a T-rex. Yep. It&#39;s that weird.)<br><br>Ironsky.net is the address. Type it in if you dare, because apparently it doesn&#39;t turn into a link.<br><br>Now, some of you may be asking, why am I suddenly so knowledgeable about this movie that hS told us about one random day? The answer is: I got curious, especially since 2018 (when the space Nazis land in the movie) is the second calendar year in <i>this school year</i>, and I started speculating about what some of my friends would do if some of the spacefaring fascists took a wrong turn and landed near their location. Upon reading the plot of the movie on Wikipedia, I learned exactly how hilariously weird the movie was (and also concluded that were this to happen IRL, I&#39;d probably get some blonde hair dye thrown at my face. And I would absolutely hate it.) I decided I liked it, and then continued researching it further. And then I found the website and bookmarked it. So yeah.<br><br>Thank you for reading my weird piece of Not News.

            <p><a href="http://localhost:3000/posts/scrape/2017/fallenlondon.com">Fallen London</a> is a thing, as those who frequent the Discord may be aware. In considerably more exciting news, a new game in the same setting, Sunless Skies, is in public beta, and was <a href="https://www.failbettergames.com/onward-to-albion-nucleosynthesis/">showcased at EGX this week</a>.<br><br>The fantastic platformer N++ is coming to Xbox One <a href="http://www.metanetsoftware.com/2017/nplusplus-coming-xbox-one-october-4-2017">very soon now</a>. If you ever played the original flash game, or N+ on the 360, you know the drill. If you never played the flash game... Well, it&#39;s free, so play it before you buy this one if you&#39;re considering it, so you know what you&#39;re in for.<br><br>Another event you may not be aware of that happened... In July? Jeez... Is the annual <a href="https://xyzzyawards.org">XYZZY Awards!</a> Where the Interactive Fiction Community picks the best IF of the year, commercial or hobbyist, CYOA and Twine stuff to traditional Parser IF ala Zork or Adventure itself. I haven&#39;t looked over this year&#39;s winners yet, but in last year&#39;s awards (for the works of 2015), <a href="http://localhost:3000/posts/scrape/2017/birdland.camp">Birdland</a>, a CYOA Twine affair, swept the categories. I would absolutely suggest playing it, because it is funny and touching and amazing and you can save the world from birds really what more do you WANT?<br><br>[takes breath after run-on]<br><br>In other news, I somehow managed to miss the release of The Delirium Brief, the newest Laundry Files Novel. The Laundry Files are, of course, excellent, and I cannot recommend them enough.</p>

            <p>As someone who doesn&#39;t read comics that much, I know about Batwoman (... obviously), and Bobby Drake over in Marvel. I also know about Apollo and the Midnighter, but they&#39;re old now. And DC&#39;s <i>Bombshells</i> series had a lot of this. And the Marvel <i>Star Wars</i> comics have the delightful Doctor Aphra... <b>anyway</b>.

            <p>Greg Rucka confirmed in an interview earlier this year that at minimum the version of Wonder Woman that he and Nicola Scott wrote was bisexual.

            <p>I&#39;m pretty sure Catwoman is currently in the middle of being proposed to by Batman? Also, I remember Constantine flirting with several women... are they both shown as bi, or is this something else on the spectrum?<br><br>Anyway, thanks! Random trivia I&#39;ve heard:<br><br>-Apparently Bobby Drake was always implied to be gay (depending on the writer, at least); it&#39;s just that it&#39;s only recently they&#39;ve been allowed to say it. It looks like Northstar had the same issue - it was implied from his first appearance in 1979, but only said in 1992.<br><br>-Speaking of weddings... one Batwoman writer was seriously angry when DC declared that they wouldn&#39;t be allowed to let Batwoman marry her girlfriend. For... reasons? I&#39;unno.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>... I thought you were talking about a combined <i>Robot Wars/Red Dwarf</i> series. But this is <i>almost</i> as good. ;)<br><br>Now I&#39;m gonna threadjack my own thread:<br><br>Putting &#39;TERF&#39; into Google takes me to <a href="http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/TERF">this wiki</a>, which defines it as &#39;Trans-Exclusionary Radical Feminist&#39;. It clarifies that as meaning &#39;feminism which excludes trans people&#39;; it doesn&#39;t seem to say where the &#39;radical&#39; part comes in, so I&#39;m just gonna assume it means they have unfilled (but neutral) outer electron shells and leave it at that.<br><br>Then it says this:<br><br><i>Their position (which is not shared by this wiki) denies that trans people&#39;s self-affirmed <b>genders and sexes</b> are equally valid as cis people&#39;s self-affirmed genders and sexes.</i> (Bold added by me.)<br><br>So, then. My understanding is that &#39;sex&#39; is a biological term; it can either indicate the nature of your primary sexual characteristics, or your chromosomes (these often match). It&#39;s not strictly a binary affair, but it comes pretty close. Does transitioning sex therefore imply surgery? Or is a change in <b>secondary</b> sexual characteristics (which includes things like body hair, I think) considered a change of sex? (Or is this a &#39;depends who you talk to&#39; question?)<br><br>Then we come to gender, which is... what? A collection of traits traditionally culturally associated with a sex, and restrictions/requirements connected to them? It&#39;s obvious that being female-gendered rather than male-gendered (or vice versa) is a big deal for many people (this is what we call &#39;understatement&#39;), but I&#39;m... not clear why? The way people have talked about it here, they don&#39;t seem to be focussed on how they&#39;re viewed/treated by others (ie, it doesn&#39;t seem to be a result of variations on &#39;I&#39;m fed up of the anti-female slant of society and would rather escape it by identifying as male&#39;), but then... what?<br><br>I guess the question I&#39;m asking in this part is: what is the difference between the genders &#39;male&#39; and &#39;female&#39;, other than that other people have different prejudices assigned to the two terms?<br><br>Where the above includes misunderstandings or misinterpretations, please correct them. :) That&#39;s how we learn.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>(aka, I&#39;m attempting to pass on, with some degree of accuracy, things I read on the Internet that appeared to be backed by evidence, but people should feel free to straighten me out)<br><br>One thing that seems to exist, from what little we can tell about neurobiology, is a brain-internal map-of-the-self, which gives you a general sense of what your body should consist of. One thing included in that is which sex-linked physical characteristics you expect to have. As I understand it, that mentally-expected layout is your gender identity. This gender identity often both a) matches what is physically present and b) falls into categories we (as a culture) have created called &quot;male&quot; and &quot;female&quot;.<br><br>Not meeting condition a (gender identity != physical characteristics) makes you transgender (although I believe it&#39;s a matter of personal preference and/or  fierce debate whether that description persists after transitioning, that is, fixing your physical characteristics so they better match your gender identity, is concluded). Not meeting condition b (gender identity doesn&#39;t fall into the male/female buckets) makes you non-binary.<br><br>Complicating everything is gender expression, which is how you fit in to the cultural stuff about how a &quot;man&quot; or &quot;woman&quot; should look, act, talk, etc.. That seems to be a related but somewhat separate axis from identity and physical sex stuff. I&#39;ll leave that to someone who could say intelligent things about it, except to remark that being regarded as/referred to as/... the gender you identify as is  a very big deal, since it&#39;s, roughly speaking, a significant component of who you <i>are</i>.<br><br>- Tomash</p>

            <p>... your understanding is that &#39;transgender&#39; is actually about <i>sex</i>, not gender? Or is that only part of what you&#39;re including under &#39;physical characteristics&#39;?<br><br>Meanwhile, your &#39;condition b&#39; is about fitting in with the culturally-defined male/female binary. That seems to suggest that if someone moved to a different culture with radically different gender roles, they would automatically become non-binary (in that culture), regardless of whether they they elected to fit in by following the roles (&#39;gender expression&#39;, as you say).

            <p>First off, to clear up my confusion, what are you thinking of when you say &quot;sex&quot; and &quot;gender&quot;? (For the record, I spent that last post staying away from &quot;gender&quot; because I&#39;m not entirely sure what I mean by that word.)<br><br>From what I know, if you take a look at humans as a species, you&#39;ll notice several sex characteristics, such as chromosomal sex, reproductive-organ sex, hormonal sex, and probably a few other ones. Sex characteristics aren&#39;t binary things, but they tend to fall into two groups that tend to be correlated with each other. <br><br>One such characteristic is what I could in this context call mental sex[1], which is called &quot;gender identity&quot; (or maybe just &quot;gender&quot;, I&#39;m not sure on that).<br><br>&quot;Cisgender&quot; is having a gender identity that accurately matches your other sex characteristics[2]. &quot;Transgender&quot; is all the other cases, broadly speaking.<br><br>Gender identity, like the rest of these often-correlated things, is not a binary thing. Having a gender identity (what you expect your body to be like) that doesn&#39;t fit into the two major categories of physical layout makes you &quot;non-binary&quot;. So I think your second paragraph is somewhat off, in that non-binary is defined by what a culture considers a male body and a female body to be, social roles aside.<br><br>Now, we as a species have formed cultures that tend to take the two most visible groups of correlated sex characteristics and label them &quot;male&quot; and &quot;female&quot; (recognition of other categories seems to vary by culture). Then, there are generally social roles or expectations associated with being in (or being regarded as being in) each of these categories. Which of these expectations you follow gives you your &quot;gender expression&quot;.<br><br>[1]: I made this term up while composing this post, and it&#39;s  possibly misleading or otherwise unsuitable for general use<br>[2]: More specifically, I think having matching personally-observable sex characteristics is sufficient<br><br>- Tomash</p>

            <p>Josie McZample has female body traits. She considers herself fully female, and is attracted to men. She also wears her hair short, wears a mix of male and female clothing. Enjoys some stereotypical masculine things and some stereotypical feminine things. She is hetero cisgender with a neutral gender expression.

            <p>So! I like your definitions- I would extend gender to also include a lot of self-image and body-shape stuff, though. The world at large believes that women have long hair, hips, a waistline, breasts, etc, therefore that image is part of that gender.<br><br>We trans people don&#39;t really talk about &quot;transitioning sex&quot; much- even the term &quot;sex reassignment surgery&quot; is falling out of favor for &quot;gender reassignment&quot; or &quot;gender confirmation&quot;. The point of my journey has been entirely about my relationship to my gender- both how the world sees me and how I see myself. The most biologically heavy part of it is that testosterone was making me all kinds of depressed, and getting off that stuff gave me huge dividends.<br><br>Gender is all about self-chosen identity. It&#39;s frequently conveniently in line with how our bodies are shaped, which is the state we call being cisgender. Ultimately, though, it&#39;s a choice we make- how are we shaped? How do we want to be shaped? What hormones are we comfortable with? Where aren&#39;t we comfortable with our bodies? Basically all the answers to these questions fall into the arena of gender.<br><br>The words we use are really just trying to describe the very squishy answers to those questions- they&#39;re not hard categories, they&#39;re definitely not easy to be specific with, and all of them are mostly used to try to talk about our feelings and experiences. I won&#39;t go into the dictionary 101 here, but it&#39;s important to note- &quot;trans&quot; is a huge umbrella, and &quot;non-binary&quot; is usually included in it. Non-binary itself is a big umbrella, there are tons of experiences contained in it. As you would figure, given that it&#39;s literally &quot;outside these two well-known options.&quot;<br><br>Some non-binary people find a lot of help in hormone therapies, and other pieces of the stereotypical binary-to-binary transition process. Others don&#39;t- it varies by person. I&#39;m even technically non-binary- while my transition looks very stereotypically b-2-b, I&#39;m genderfluid- there are days where I&#39;m a woman and it&#39;s important to me to be perceived as such by myself and others, and there are also days where I&#39;m agender- &quot;do I have to engage with social constructs of gender today? Really?&quot;<br><br>So! On to the McZamples!<br><br>Alex is indeed a cis man.<br><br>Bobbie is an interesting case. If she wanted to be flat-chested, flat-hipped, etc, and was taking hormones to deliberately produce that expression, non-binary would make sense as a label. On the other hand, if it&#39;s just how she was, I&#39;d be wondering if she was intersex- that&#39;s the usual term for when someone&#39;s primary and secondary sex characteristics, hormone balances, and chromosomes didn&#39;t fit a normal model. Intersex people can identify as trans, and some find a lot of self-understanding in non-binary identities, but some don&#39;t.<br><br>Charlie is probably a trans man- once again, if they chose to take that identity.<br><br>Drew is adorable, and deserves pets.<br><br>El is also complicated. There are cis men who enjoy wearing dresses- Eddie Izzard, for example. There are also cis men who perform drag, putting on an entire feminine identity for a while. They also could be non-binary, expressing a feminine side- you specified that they were comfortable with a masculine/testosterone-oriented body, so the only option there that&#39;s really off the table is being a trans woman. (I have a friend who&#39;s the sweetest guy you&#39;ll ever meet, definitely a guy, and looks absolutely smashing in a miniskirt and heels.)<br><br>Frankie is probably non-binary- their ideal body shape is compatible with neither binary option.<br><br>George is probably a cis woman with tomboy or butch tendencies- I&#39;m assuming that they&#39;re fine with she/her pronouns, and generally being &quot;that girl who plays football&quot;?<br><br>Harper is a cis woman, also with tomboy or butch tendencies- as you&#39;ve noted, they&#39;re now in the mystical land of butch women. Please send me the address and nearest airport code...<br><br>Id could take a few different identities- they could be a very femme trans-man, although mainstream western society doesn&#39;t really have a role for that. They could also be non-binary, if they wanted to acknowledge and claim a feminine side to their identity.<br><br>-Delta Juliette<br>(Or, She Who Writes Many Words About Gender With Little Provocation McZample)</p>

            <p>I always find the best way to figure out if you&#39;ve understood someone is to repeat it back to them in your own words. So here we go:<br><br>What you seem to be saying is that &#39;gender&#39; means (to coin a hopefully neutral word) &#39;bodyshape&#39;: the physical makeup of your body, including primary and secondary sexual characteristics, hormonal balance, and things like hair length and such.<br><br>You&#39;re then saying that people have an innate sense of what their bodyshape/gender should be; you&#39;re not putting it quite as strongly as Tomash did, but I think the idea&#39;s there. Essentially the Residual Self-Image from the Matrix, but for real life.<br><br>You then note that bodyshape (ideal and current/actual) falls broadly into two categories, which are to an extent socially-defined - long hair was a mark of male youth in Renaissance Italy, for instance, but not so much today. Most people are comfortable in one of those two categories, which pegs them as cis/trans-male/female, in some combination.<br><br>Anything which falls outside those categories is non-binary. How far does that go? I&#39;m guessing short hair doesn&#39;t make a woman non-binary; or does it, if the intent of cutting it short is to be un-feminine (without specifically/necessarily being masculine)?<br><br>And then you throw out the term &#39;agender&#39;, which I think means that on some days your innate sense of what your body should look like... what? Gives up and goes home? That seems to be what you&#39;re implying (or at least that you don&#39;t see it as important on those days), but I&#39;m honestly not sure.<br><br>How did I do?<br><br>hS<br><br>(I really don&#39;t think you can call this &#39;little provocation. ^_~)</p>

            <p>There&#39;s one other thing to gender that&#39;s almost impossible to put into words- there&#39;s a sense, somewhere deep inside us, of what group we belong to. I can look at another woman and recognize- I might not look like her, we might have wildly different outfits or body shapes, but we recognize that we are the same group in a way that any guy- even my hypothetical cis-male twin, would not be.<br><br>And I think that&#39;s the missing part here- everything else probably shapes that underlying sense, and we&#39;re comfortable or uncomfortable with bodyshape, presentation, hormones, etc based off of the combination of it and social constructions. It&#39;s all approximately as circular as only psychology can be- but there is that deep group-sense that is usually called &quot;gender identity&quot;. Everyone has it. Most (cis) people don&#39;t question it. But it&#39;s still there.<br><br>So! with that introduction- you&#39;ve pretty much got it! Bodyshape is a thing that&#39;s very significant (I&#39;ve even seen it alter my perceptions of myself- looking in a mirror and wait, where did those curves come from? Or where did they go? I could swear I wasn&#39;t shaped like this yesterday...), and for most people, falls into two (broad, mostly socially-defined) categories.<br><br>I believe that non-binary identities, as with trans identities, are just that- they come from, at root, internally-held gender identities. My sister, who habitually cuts her hair short, identifies as a woman- therefore, when she performs stereotypically un-womanly actions (cutting her hair short, wearing flannel, driving a pickup truck), she is a woman performing stereotypically un-womanly actions.<br><br>On the other hand, a non-binary person, whose gender identity is some combination of not-a-woman and not-a-man, is inherently non-binary. Everything that they do, both in life in general and to be comfortable with their body and presentation, is being done as a non-binary person. Cutting their hair short, discarding a normal image of femininity, brings great relief to some NB people who society wants to see as women.<br><br>And here it&#39;s important to note- while a lot of NB people aim for maximum androgyny- that&#39;s their ideal bodyshape, presentation, etc, there are many who do not. The things they do, the way they present and shape themselves, are reflections of their underlying gender identities rather than creating said gender identities.<br><br>And finally! Agender is a gender identity that pretty much boils down to, as you so wonderfully said, the sense of self-shape and gender giving up and going home. When I&#39;m agender, I don&#39;t want to be seen, or see myself, as an entity that contains gender. We don&#39;t agonize over what gender a building is (except maybe in Spanish class), so why should we worry about mine? I just want to be seen as a person- gender identity has left the building, middle fingers upraised.<br><br>Obvious disclaimer: agender is definitely not the only non-binary identity, or even the only non-binary identity I visit. There are days where I relish being maximally androgynous, where I want to see people try, and fail, to put me into a binary box. Agender is... not like that. It&#39;s &quot;why are we playing this stupid gender game, again?&quot;, it&#39;s &quot;don&#39;t try to ma&#39;am/sir me, just give me my damn coffee.&quot;</p>

            <p>I think, in general, it&#39;s safe to say most cisgender people don&#39;t go &quot;Hmm, what am I, yes I am male&quot; or &quot;yes I am female&quot; because they don&#39;t need to question their identity. To them, their gender just <i>is</i>.<br><br>I identify as agender (most of the time; it tends to change) and while I was a kid, I never much thought about what I was. Whenever I told people I was a boy that day and was laughed off, I figured it was just me being weird and kind of suppressed that. And then puberty hit, and with it came the dysphoria and a sense that something wasn&#39;t quite <i>right</i>. Still, I kept on thinking maybe I was just a weird girl, because I knew I wasn&#39;t a boy (except when I <i>was, oh god why is this so confusing what is happening to me is this normal?</i>).<br><br>When you already know what you are and where you feel you belong, there&#39;s not much reason to put a lot of thought into it.<br><br>So that&#39;s my $.02, for what it&#39;s worth.</p>

            <p>Now that I&#39;ve been exposed to more different kinds of people and learned more about the world, though, I definitely do.<br><br>I think about my gender when I have conversations about books with an older friend of mine who is so very female she finds it difficult to relate to male characters in male-authored books, who (she says) don&#39;t care about the things she cares about. That experience is totally alien to me, though I suspect it&#39;s fairly common, so it does make me question my female identity. I&#39;ve always related to male characters just fine, my first best friend in preschool was a boy, and though my closest friends in elementary school were girls (one a tomboy and one even more introverted than me), from about middle school on, I&#39;ve tended to get on with most men better than most women. I also write a ton more male characters than female ones, and even as a kid, I&#39;d happily play male roles. In dreams, sometimes I&#39;m a guy, too. It&#39;s not <i>me</i>, I don&#39;t think—I&#39;m often not me in dreams—but still.<br><br>And yet I&#39;m female, always have been, always will be. I find that pretty dang weird. ^_^; Like, with all that maleness in me, why am I <i>not</i> trans or agender? Because I know I&#39;m not.<br><br>I tend to think it&#39;s because I was never treated as weird by my family? It was always okay to like who and what I liked, and be who I wanted to be, even if they didn&#39;t always entirely approve of my choices (like outfits consisting entirely of pink sweatclothes, yeesh, why was I allowed out the door).<br><br>Hence why I would sort of like it if the whole concept of gender would go defenestrate itself, because it&#39;s confusing and weird and often seems to hurt more than it helps? Except that it&#39;s actually important for lots of people.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I think I may just be to introverted to grasp, in any non-intellectual sense, the concept of &#39;belonging&#39; that you&#39;re trying to convey.

            <p>Scientifically, at least, <i>sex</i> is always used for an organism&#39;s biological characteristics—the gonads, chromosomes, and hormones. The stuff that&#39;s definitely not a choice or a social construct. Everybody is born with a sex, whether it&#39;s male, female, or intersex. (Side note: some people have interesting combinations of sex chromosomes such as XO, XXY, XYY, and more! These combinations tend to cause health and development problems, some obvious, some not.)<br><br><i>Gender</i>, therefore, is all that other stuff we&#39;ve been talking about: the internal mindstate, the Residual Self-Image, the social expectations, the chosen self-expression relating/contrary to one&#39;s biological sex.<br><br>So I guess my question is answered by the existence of the brain&#39;s map of the body, and transgenderism would still be a thing even in the absence of any social expectations relating to body shape. There would still be people with body dysphoria.<br><br>That&#39;s my take on all this, anyway.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I actually know someone who&#39;s mosaic 46-XX/XY: some of their cells are &quot;normal&quot; XX, and others are &quot;normal&quot; XY. They&#39;re cool people, and a big activist for intersex issues here at work.<br><br>It&#39;s also possible for people to be genetically &quot;normal&quot; and still intersex- there are lots of developmental conditions that can produce intersex bodies. And there&#39;s things like Complete Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome, in which an apparently normal woman has a Y chromosome.<br><br>And we pretty much try to use sex for the scientific reason- although, for trans people whose transitions include chemical or physical changes, &quot;biological sex&quot; becomes an incredibly complicated concept. I&#39;m at risk for breast cancer... and prostate cancer. Whoops?<br><br>And, yeah. My dysphoria was entirely rooted in the shape of my body and the unhappiness of a brain trying to run on testosterone. That would exist regardless of the society I did, or didn&#39;t, find myself in- even now, post-transition, I&#39;m still just &quot;one of the engineers&quot;- which is basically indistinguishable from &quot;one of the guys&quot;. (There&#39;s a whole &#39;nother rant here about the male-centric nature of the technology industry, but I&#39;ll spare you all.)<br><br>There are people who are otherwise! There are people whose dysphoria includes not being seen as who they are, and that&#39;s a very real form of dysphoria too. There are people who feel no physical discomfort, just social discomfort, and that&#39;s enough reason for them to change.<br><br>-Delta</p>

            <p>Tomash has successfully articulated an interpretation that I could correctly create eight examples from. Which is great! ... so long as it&#39;s <i>right</i>. So (and I&#39;m taking your commenting on this thread as implying an interest in saying <i>something</i>; feel free to ignore me if I&#39;m wrong) are you at least able to say whether you agree with his explanation? Which comes down to &#39;everyone has a body image, if it disagrees with your actual body then you&#39;re some degree of trans&#39;.<br><br>(Alternately/also, if you think any of the McZamples are wrong, that could be a good way to try and explain things.)<br><br>(Or you can just not, if you prefer.)<br><br>(But I&#39;d rather be confused than wrong. ^_^)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Postulating a future society in which everyone is free to express entirely who they are on the inside regardless of what parts they have on the outside, is transgenderism still a thing? Or is it mostly or entirely a product of society trying to force people into roles they don&#39;t fit based on the shape of their bodies?<br><br>Recognizing the answer to this may be different for different people, and not wishing to minimize anyone&#39;s experience, as a woman who has never especially bought into &quot;being a girl&quot; per society while being completely comfortable having a female body and being referred to as such, I just wonder.<br><br>Is it possible to someday do away with gender and just approach everyone as people with a spectrum of anatomies and interests and means of self-expression, or do we need those categories?<br><br>~Neshomeh is curious and likes thought experiments.</p>
