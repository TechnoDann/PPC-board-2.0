            <p>This is a fictionalized version of Miguel, so I&#39;m not committing libel.

            <p>So this is basically just a series of reactions I had while reading:<br><br>I like the interruption of the rap!<br><br>...PRUSSIA. You should bring in Prussia to spork. I didn&#39;t get that far in the show, but I saw him used for sporking once, and it was amazing.<br><br>...oh, good, Prussia is actually in the fic. That would make his potential sporking presence better and, uh, sense-having. Wait, which of the kids is he essentially turning into? He wouldn&#39;t make sense with any of them, except maybe a teenaged Marauder or the Weasley twins, but--oh dear. This should be... interesting.<br><br>...Malfoy. Prussia is Malfoy. What.<br><br>Go Ron go! In fact, please keep talking. For the entire fic. That would be lovely.<br><br>...Hungary, dear... Hermione does not like flying.<br><br>Yeah, I give up. There&#39;s no sense in this fic except for Ron and, sometimes, Ginny. I like &quot;you uncultured ferret&quot; from Ami in the sporking, though.<br><br>Ooh, you&#39;ve brought England in! From the OFU, no less!<br><br>Well, that was fun. And &#39;Monstery Science Theater&#39; was well-placed.<br><br>Overall, pretty fun. I&#39;d love to see...well, just about any of the countries come in to spork. Maybe people from HP or unrelated (but similarly themed?) canons, too, if that&#39;s an option. Also, might as well third that suggestion of that one country with the polar bear...<br><br>Good job!<br><br>~Zing</p>

            <p>I understand that you are trying to improve, I really do. I understand as well that you wish to take a break from the community, get help, and try to improve your mental condition. I feel the same way to some degree.<br><br>I also understand, however, that you have tried to talk to me for a while now with beta requests and chat messages and replies to OTHER PEOPLE about your issues. It seems like you&#39;re making the same mistake I used to, in that you are trying to seek attention from us so, in your view, we can act as a sounding board for your problems. Ordinarily, I would indeed be willing to try to help, since I have after all been in your shoes before. But that very fact is also why I believe you are making a very big mistake here.<br><br>I worried about the potential backlash against me to say this to you publicly until now, but I will say it anyway: I&#39;m not in the mood to deal with you. Never have been, never will be. Your first Permission attempt, even without my disastrous involvement in it, resulted in me beginning to lose trust in you, and even after gaining Permission - as a sockpuppet no less - you have ignored concrit, refused to apologize for being disrespectful, and now outright harrassed another Boarder to get them to listen to you. All of this has made me very uncomfortable with the prospect of interacting with you, which is not something I want to say to another Boarder. I also don&#39;t have the time to deal with you because I have my own IRL things to worry about, and the last thing I need is to let my anger get the better of me and fuel the fire once again - if it already is as I type this, I apologize in advance to both you and the Board at large. That is not an excuse for any of your own behavior, though, and the new revelations related to you over the past few weeks have further tarnished my faith in you, and this is coming from someone who WANTS to see you improve. As it stands, though, we are not the audience for that.<br><br>If you planned to send me your phone number, don&#39;t. Period. If you still wish to send me an e-mail, please wait until I get my own Duckletts in a row and feel more ready to handle this predicament, which I believe is inevitable given that I beta read for you before. For now, though, if you want to take the time off to regroup, then just GO. And in the event that you do, I hope you find something more constructive to take up your time.</p>

Maybe there was a preconception that I should be angry when I knew that I wasn&#39;t going to make it on my first attempt.<br><br>I am also confused about a lot of what you are accusing me of.

            <p>This is what I and probably several others are worried about. You aren&#39;t dispelling a bogeyman. You&#39;re causing another incident and proving the people worried about your behavior right. Could things have been handled better? Probably. But making the same mistakes again and again after they have been patiently and impatiently explained to you is not the fault of the community. That every other thread involving you in recent weeks has gotten bad enojugh that punishments had to be considered is not the fault of the community. <br><br>You feel you should defend yourself.  But you&#39;ve been on the attack for most of this thread. You seem to want the community to validate Zdimensia&#39;s actions and say that what happened before was wrong. This is simply not the case. <br><br>Your question on why your first permission request was denied is answered in that thread, in the post denying it. HS has posted it further down the chat, but the summary was that your request was incomplete and you weren&#39;t prepared. When it was denied, you made changes in the same thread instead of taking time to revise and reconsider. <br><br>You are showing disrespect by saying that the reason why someone, in this case Skarmory, is distrusting you is because of issues in their past, (Apologies to Skarmory if this comes out as rude) rather than because of your behavior. To make this matter clear, I have issues trusting you because of how you have behaved. <br></p>

            <p>In the recent weeks, I had determined to tell the truth, but was waiting for something beyond my control to happen first.  I recall only one incident, which was handled in a very proper manner.<br><br>There was also another issue in the outside world, which may or may not be relevant here.  (Note to self, AdDCr.)<br><br>In the non-recent weeks, I have made mistakes, but I&#39;ve given my full effort into not making them again.<br><br><hr>

<br><br>I didn&#39;t know that I wasn&#39;t supposed to revise my permission thread.  IIRC, my first real permission thread as zd wasn&#39;t expecting permission, but wanting acknowledgement that I was on the right track.<br><br><hr>
<br><br>I believe that the issues of whether to trust or distrust someone comes from past experience.  I could elaborate, but it would be viewed as a non-sequitur.  (I have no idea what I was talking about here.)<br><br>In short, something about me made Skarmory distrust me.  In Skarmory&#39;s case, it was perfectly valid because they had a vivid memory of a bad memory of me, and I came back with traits that they still recognized.

            <p>with being on a list of people to have Bramandin&#39;s phone number. I do not believe that Bramandin has good intentions in their interactions with the PPC. The complaints Bramandin puts forth here are near identical to the ones from years ago. There is no demonstration of acceptance of personal wrongdoing on their part. <br><br>I feel like every interaction I have witnessed since returning is manipulative with the purpose of attaining recognized victimhood. This actually seems to be a near obsession, that the PPC must be forced to admit that they victimized ZDimensionsa years ago and then to proceed in giving them the attention they feel they deserve. All the attempts to make themselves seem like the reasonable one(the posts below for everyone else to wait until the dust settles), and the more mature one (see the posts they are still posting on the Grand Concilliary the last couple of days) are, in my opinion, just bait to get everyone to let them by with their behavior. Any apology they give is just a ploy to get them clear for a little while to attain what they actually want (see the beta request they have thrown into this thread. I have observed that several threads they have begun with high drama and then roped people into feeling sorry enough for them to attempt to beta for them after they had just behaved badly toward their betas). <br><br>I do not buy the argument that it is a misunderstanding at this point. It has been explained, many, many times, and Bramandin has explicitly stated in her email thread that she intentionally manipulates the folks here. This is what people who are emotionally abusive do. They turn everything around until they are the victim. They demand apologies from others for <i>their</i> behavior. I am too tired right now to go through all the posts again to link it directly, but I have the distinct impression that some of their posts fit well with the concept of &#39;negging&#39;.<br><br>Undoubtedly the next response from her will be a nearly incoherent, non-sequitur filled rant that indicates that I am a horrible bully. I am saying undoubtedly, because that is the exact pattern of behavior that has been followed since 2014.<br><br>I believe that my questioning of their motives did not come through strongly enough in my earlier post. Or maybe it was my stated desire to not cast a vote due to my relative newness and I had not read the email thread yet, so they have now cast me as being on &#39;their&#39; side. For explicit communication here. I am not. At this point if it comes to a vote, if my vote counts for anything, I will vote for a ban. I do not believe Bramandin is good for this community or that their intentions are in anyway good.<br><br>I feel very strongly about what I am about to say here. Being autistic is no excuse for their continued behavior as being autistic does not in any way mean &#39;incapable of learning&#39;. A mistake may be made in entire innocence one time, but once it has been explained, it is arguably not made in innocence the second time, and definitely is not made in innocence after the fiftieth time it has been explained. It also does not mean, &#39;callous disregard for others as emotional beings&#39;. It might mean that the person gets through an entire conversation and only hours later realizes that the other person was upset due to poor reading of the situation, but does not mean that when they realize the other person was upset that they then feel nothing for the other person. <br><br><i>Autistic people are not sociopaths.</i></p>

            <p>...are very divided. I shall present these as a dialogue with myself:<br><br><b>Delta:</b> I think Tomash has a point. I don&#39;t think Bram is acting maliciously, and... this smells a bit witch-hunt-y.<br><br><b>Juliette:</b> But on the other hand, <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=308897;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">I agree with Phobos</a>, from a constitutional analysis, some pretty fundamental behavioral guidelines for the community have been solidly broken.<br><br><b>Delta:</b> To pick a specific point, I think that Phobos&#39;s charge of sockpuppeting, though technically true, is both past the statute of limitations and wasn&#39;t done maliciously - zdimensia existed as an attempt to prove a point, if I&#39;m reading Bram correctly. And... that&#39;s been a thing that&#39;s been done before, IIRC. hS has done so, I have done so, a couple Veteran Members of the Community have created sockpuppets for the specific purpose of stepping completely outside of oldbie privilege and throwing their voice into the milieu to see what happened.<br><br><b>Juliette:</b> Sure... but that was done for specific purposes, and when the experiment ended (days later, rather than years!), the experiment was explained and data was discussed.<br><br><b>Delta:</b> To expand back out to a more general argument, I don&#39;t think that Bram has done anything out of active malice - the heat of the moment seems to be a longer-lived concept for her, and she lacks communication skills that those of us who are closer to neurotypicality have, but... that&#39;s not being malicious. Should we really ban someone for Not Getting It?<br><br><b>Juliette:</b> But that&#39;s it. She Doesn&#39;t Get It, or so it seems, and that includes not working with the many people who have offered to help. And that&#39;s not something we can fix - I deeply appreciate the PPC&#39;s utility over the years as a space where we have helped people become more mature, understand themselves, and so on, but that process is voluntary and I don&#39;t see Bram accepting that help.<br><br><b>Both:</b> Bottom line, I don&#39;t think that her being here, in her current state, is good for her or for the community. It&#39;s not an at-fault situation, it&#39;s a fundamental mismatch of communication skills and technologies.<br><br>Ideally, I would like Bram to work with a mentor/advisor on communication skills. It could be one of us. It could be me! I&#39;ve volunteered, she knows how to poke me on Discord. I would like her to acknowledge that she needs some guardrails, that this chunk of road is twistier for her than it is for other people. I would like to see her learn, and grow, and become an awesome member of this community.<br><br>But I don&#39;t think we&#39;re in an ideal situation. I really, really dislike swinging the banhammer in this case, it&#39;s not at all as clear-cut as ypurs were. But I believe that the current situation should not be allowed to continue. I believe we have given enough offers of help, given enough additional chances, had enough of this sort of conversation.<br><br>Ultimately, I believe that a banning may be necessary, in the interest of cutting off an interaction that is clearly hurting Bram as well as the rest of us.</p>

            <p>Okay, so the main thing is that this situation with Bramandrin is actually very much reminding me of someone I used to know in the FBA (who I won&#39;t name here: if you want to find out more, you can DM me on Discord for more specific details). I actually mentioned this to Tomash on Discord a couple days back, but I&#39;d actually describe this person as &quot;Bramandrin, with a much better grasp of social norms and a huge anger management problem&quot;. The other main difference I can think of was that the person in question was also allowed to get into a position of authority there, and I will say, that wreaked havoc on everything: when this person finally left the FBA, they did so in an outburst of drama fueled by something that I won&#39;t talk about here (mostly because it is an incredibly long story that&#39;s not relevant to this, and partly because this person had also quit the position of authority in question twice in a row over much less anyhow).<br><br>So you might be wondering what the common thread here is. Well... for me, judging from things Bramandrin said in a previous thread related to this, these two people both suffer from untreated mental illness of some variety, and it is mental illness that, to be honest, does require professional psychiatric help. Anyone who tells Bram she doesn&#39;t need the psychiatric help is willfully deceiving either her or themselves at this point.<br><br>So my suggestion is this: regardless of whether or not Bram gets banned, my previous experiences make me feel it will be to both her and the PPC community&#39;s benefit if she seeks out psychiatric help. And Bram, if you read this, I know you may think you may not need the help, but trust me: you need the help. Your behavior is not normal, and psychiatric help can give you a better idea of how to excise your present unacceptable behaviors. This was something the former FBAer in question really should have gotten years ago, and I&#39;m going to mention it here before we get too far down the rabbit hole of banning folks.<br><br>The issue is, I don&#39;t know if this is something we can necessarily enforce. But no matter the case, I really honestly think this is the only way forward in this case. If that doesn&#39;t work, who knows, but I know from past experience that if she doesn&#39;t get help, it could be a bigger thorn in the PPC&#39;s side than I really think you guys want.<br><br>-Herr</p>

            <p>First, from Tomash:<br>&quot;Subject: Given this post, vote change<br><br>Bramandin has agreed to her temporary, but indefinite voluntary departure (with IP block enforcement!) from the PPC so that she might work on her mental difficulties after this thread ends. I support this.<br><br>However, I&#39;d like to modify the proposal slightly: lifting this block should require <i>some</i> indication (either made privately or by posting from an unblocked IP) that Bramandin has, in fact, made progress on, to put it vaguely, Getting It. <br><br>In other words, my new proposal is for a voluntary (and therefore not as precedent-setting), <i>indefinite</i> (but temporary) block, which shall be lifted upon receipt of a request that indicates some (not necessarily massive, but more than tiny, unless that&#39;s all that&#39;s needed) improvement in Bramandin&#39;s ability to interact with the PPC.<br><br>(To extend Bram&#39;s analogy, I&#39;m proposing this modification because, when you have a cast on, you can&#39;t take it off just because you <i>feel</i> like your bone isn&#39;t broken anymore.) <br><br>I again, for the record, agree with Bramandin&#39;s concern that permanently banning her sets a bad precedent regarding bans for mental health issues. My proposal above is just at the line of what I&#39;m OK with in terms of what we decide, mostly because it&#39;s basically voluntary and there&#39;s some externally-observable measure of progress we can use to lift the block once it&#39;s no longer needed. <br><br>Bram, I wish you the best of luck in your future and hope to see you have more productive interactions with the community  eventually.&quot;<br><br>Then from me, doctorlit:<br>Bramandin, I am very proud of you for deciding to leave temporarily.  I think it&#39;s a very good choice, and I hope it does a lot of good for your health!  (Also, that&#39;s a very clever screen name you picked!  I&#39;m disappointed with myself that I never thought to search for it to see what it meant.)<br><br>I want to throw in my support for Tomash&#39;s proposal.  I think it&#39;s fair to both Bramandin and the rest of the community, and just generally reasonable all around.<br><br>—doctorlit</p>

            <p>1/ Tomash, I&#39;m sure I&#39;ve said this before, but: on the Board, IP blocking is only used <i>when they won&#39;t leave by themselves</i>. It isn&#39;t a higher level of ban, despite a fair number of people thinking it is. It&#39;s just technical enforcement, and applies to every ban.<br><br>2/ With that in mind, the Nameless Admin will block Bramandin&#39;s IP address at her request, <b>if</b> there is broad consensus on the Board that this is an acceptable use of Nameless Admin access. I refuse to extend the remit of the Nameless Admin one iota off my own bat.<br><br>3/ The &#39;indication&#39; proposed will not have anything to do with the Nameless Admin, who doesn&#39;t have that authority. It is vested in the Board/the community as a whole. And more personally, I don&#39;t want it to be made to or through me.<br><br>I&#39;d also like to throw in an additional proposal, not dependent on this one, that Bramandin voluntarily go through the Permission process again (after said &#39;block&#39;, if such occurs). I think it would be good for her as a writer, and would allay the issues people have with the way she handled it last time. (If accepted, this would mean she couldn&#39;t write or publish anything until after doing so, but wouldn&#39;t affect her previous writings.)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>&quot;To 1): I used &quot;block&quot; because it was a technically accurate word for what I was proposing and because it wasn&#39;t &quot;ban&quot; (which didn&#39;t feel like the right word at the time). I didn&#39;t mean to imply that a block is a super-ban or anything like that. Sorry about the miscommunication.<br><br>&quot;To 2): It seems that having the Nameless Admin block people who /ask to be blocked/ is a reasonable and obvious extension of their powers as currently defined. I don&#39;t object (probably wouldn&#39;t have proposed it if I did).<br><br>&quot;To 3): Yeah, the unblock would be a matter for consensus. However, I envision that the unblock will have a smaller threshold (no one commenting is approval, for example) than, say, a ban or a constitutional amendment.<br><br>&quot;- Tomash&quot;</p>

            <p>As said elsewhere, you can write whatever you want for the drawer.

            <p>Admittedly, I have been gone a long time, and have read through a lot of this as a crash course, so I am getting a rather condensed view, but I haven&#39;t seen anything but attack after attack from Bramandin against either the entire community or individuals within it. The Grand Concilliary is still open, and as was stated within it many times, it was the place to address grievances with the goal of not having threads like this one that bring up the past again and again. Bramandin posted in it several times, so they saw it. Why a new dramatic thread here a few days after that one fell off the front page? <br><br>And it is the same accusations that have been present in every single Bramandin drama thread, in which they vaguely and with very, very confusing words claim that the entire PPC is mean to them and owes them an apology. Vague accusations of bullying. Demands that everyone apologize to them. Excuses that being autistic made them do it (I, personally, find that to be a highly offensive excuse for bad behavior. Especially bad behavior that has been repeatedly and explicitly explained as bad behavior). Excuses that it was actually the other members of the community who were behaving badly. Just a lot of excuses and claims that they are the victim. Every single time. Including the last one with Iximaz just a week or two ago.  <br><br>I am confused by most of the posts in this thread by Bramandin. They objectively do not make sense, so I actually have very little idea of what it is they are accusing the PPC of other than them being the victim of the PPC.<br><br>I am not putting forth a vote for anything, but also I do not understand the statements that Bramandin is behaving better when this thread looks very much like all the others.<br><br>I&#39;m not trying to be offensive, and I apologize if anything in here is. Please point it out to me, so I can not do it in the future, but also, please someone explain this to me.</p>

            <p>Just to avoid ambiguity, everything other than this sentence is Tomash&#39;s words.<br><br>&quot;Subject: My thoughts and proposals<br><br>From what I can tell, Bram is working on her behavior. We&#39;ve forgiven a lot (or, in the recent case, handed out a formal last chance instead of striking Bram down with a banhammer) because of what appeared to be genuine attempts at improvement. Adding one count of ban evasion to the list of things we&#39;ll be willing to understandably forgive doesn&#39;t seem like too much of a stretch. So count this as (unless other people or a closer look at the archives convince me otherwise) a vote against the continuation of the permaban.<br><br>One of my secondary reasons for that vote is that this is partly analogous to Scapegrace&#39;s situation, which has also been marked by problems interacting with the community and (from what I can tell) genuine attempts at working on mental-illness-induced behavior issues.<br><br>That being said, I&#39;ve read over the emails Neshomeh provided, and I see there that Bramadin admitted to lying and manipulating her way to a Permission grant. From what I can tell, the only reason that we don&#39;t have a rule about that is that we didn&#39;t expect anyone to do it (same as, for example, doxxing). For that, I propose <b>Permission Revoked</b> going forward, without any restrictions on re-applying by the usual process. Let me be clear, this revocation is NOT for &quot;bad writing&quot; and NOT for &quot;being bad at taking concrit&quot;, since that&#39;s a precedent I&#39;d not like to see set.<br><br>Permission being revoked means that Bram is still welcome to write PPC stuff privately (and get it beta&#39;d), and to post things that don&#39;t require Permission (Permission requests, most RPs, and so on), but that she&#39;s not to represent any of that work as canonical/official stories set in the PPC universe.<br><br>Now, to Bramadin:<br><br>From what I can tell, you&#39;ve accused the community of being abusive or bullies, and I&#39;m not sure what it it we&#39;ve done that seems abusive. Having a Permission process? Having a Permission process that is extremely confusing to you? Not understanding/listening to you? I just don&#39;t know. I would appreciate a concrete list of events (links and/or quotes would be nice, but I won&#39;t say they&#39;re required) where we were, from your perspective, abusive, preferably including what about that interaction was a bad thing.<br><br>Second, a lot of what you&#39;re saying isn&#39;t being understood. In a lot of the posts you&#39;ve made here, I don&#39;t understand what message you are trying to communicate with your words. You&#39;ve said that you&#39;re using a lot of &quot;parallels&quot; to try to communicate (if this is what I&#39;m thinking of, my name for that sort of thing is &quot;private metaphors&quot;). They are, in most cases, not being understood, in the sense that they&#39;re not conveying much of a message at all. Also, in some of your posts, you&#39;re using pronouns (or pronoun-like things) in a way that makes it impossible for us to tell what you&#39;re referring to. For example, &quot;the scowlers&quot; in your post on racism.. I&#39;m still not sure who you&#39;re talking about there.<br><br>Lastly, I&#39;m going to echo various people who are saying that we don&#39;t have the resources to help you thrive here, and that it might be best for you to leave, at least temporarily.<br><br>Now, on a meta note, can I post here same as in the Concilliary, since this is the same sort of thread (namely, a discussion of bad behavior with possible votes)?<br><br>- Tomash&quot;</p>

            <p>Specifically, the request for a list of events which Bramandin perceives as other Boarders being abusive.<br><br>I disagree, however, with the notion that this is the same sort of thread as the Grand Concilliary. That thread was a special case, intended to resolve past conflicts <i>including one involving Tomash</i>. I believe that last part is the important part with respect to Tomash being allowed to post - the Grand Concilliary could not have been allowed to pass without him having the opportunity to defend himself.<br><br>This, though, does not involve him, and is not a thread that is likely to result in any grand, sweeping changes to the community. Therefore, I do not believe it appropriate to lift his ban from posting for this thread.</p>

            <p>It does not seem from the email chain that Bramandin &quot;lied and manipulated her way to a Permission grant&quot; (except in that she did not disclose her previous ban). She certainly lied through and manipulated the Permission <i>process</i>; see <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=296967;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">here</a> for the moment I got so fed up with her &#39;oh my character cannot do any of the prompts&#39; line and fed her three random prompts which could literally happen to anyone - but Permission was granted based on July&#39;s opinion of her work and behaviour. See <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=297522;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">here</a>.<br><br>There are ways to cheat the Permission process. One would be to plagiarise something and present it as your writing sample, or get a disgruntled ex-PPCer to do so. Another would be to just... lie and say you got Permission ages back. I would also count having the person who grants you Permission act as beta/cowriter, or anything else which means their objectivity is compromised. Bramandin, so far as Neshomeh&#39;s chat logs go, didn&#39;t do any of those things.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Since this came up in Nesh&#39;s transcript, and I remember it as a bugbear for zdimensia as well, I thought I&#39;d explain why people (PGs) have seemed inconsistent about whether you can write missions before you get Permission.<br><br>The thing is, Permission is <s><a href="http://s66.photobucket.com/user/TangledWebs/media/Permission.png.html">a torturous doom-laden trial</a></s> a filter. It is intended to filter out writers who cannot write PPC fiction well enough that it should be included in the canon. When you show us that you <i>can</i> do that - when you post your prompts and get a Permission Granted - that means that we think you can do it.<br><br>But it doesn&#39;t mean that you retroactively <i>could always</i> write well enough. If you&#39;ve already been denied Permission once, it even means that you explicitly <i>can&#39;t</i> write well enough, though we hope you soon will be able to.<br><br>So let&#39;s say you take your Permission Denied, and you write half a dozen missions. Along the way, you learn about your characters, about the PPC, about writing in general. You improve. And when you apply for Permission again, you get it, easily.<br><br>And then you post the first mission you wrote. The one that came right after you were denied Permission - or, heck, the one that came between your first and second denials. The mission that was written at a time when you were not ready to write for the PPC.<br><br>Does that clear up the confusion? The answers Bramandin received were answers to both halves of the question:<br><br>1) You <b>can write</b> whatever you want &quot;for the drawer&quot; (as Neshomeh said). PPC missions, heartwarming interludes, Flower-murder, hardcore smut. Whatever. It&#39;s your keyboard, your time, your computer.<br><br>2) You <b>cannot post</b> anything that doesn&#39;t meet the standards of the PPC. And that explicitly includes anything written before the PPC Community - through the Permission Givers it voted to put its trust and confidence in - judged you ready, able, and knowledgeable enough to write for the PPC canon.<br><br>What zdimensia seemed to want to do was &#39;pre-write&#39; her missions. She never gave the impression of seeing Permission as a test of her writing ability, but just as an arbitrary hoop to jump through.<br><br>It isn&#39;t. It&#39;s there for a reason. And that reason precludes writing <i>for publication</i> without it.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>This is why the prompts were unfair.  This is why asking me to use a team not of my choosing was unfair.  <br><br>I pointed out that all of the prompts were out-of-character for my agents.  (S&amp;L)  They were also a team that didn&#39;t really interact outside of missions.  (S&amp;L)  They turned out to be ill-conceived.  (S&amp;L)  I didn&#39;t find the problem until writing an interlude.<br><br>I wanted to start with Kim and Hue.  They are a simple team that fits the PPC expectations pretty well.  They still don&#39;t interact much outside of the missions, but I was able to find a prompt for them.<br><br><hr>
<br><br>They were hoops, with the extra restrictions.  Prove that you can write well with very strict limits on what you are writing.<br><br><hr>
<br><br>There needs to be an expansion of what can and can&#39;t be done without permission.  Just the prompts is too narrow.  Points 1 and 2 are very good, and should be added to the permission page.<br><br><hr>
<br><br>I think that it is good that the prompts are optional.  Maybe have an expectation that everything written before permission will be re-written before publication. <br><br><hr>

            <p>The problem with that is that the prompts were rather vague and broad. Most of them were situations where any team could be slotted in and have something happen. If an agent team isn&#39;t able to do anything with the prompts without being ooc, then there is probably something wrong with the team as PPC characters.</p>

<br><br>Ehm... your plot is good, though your answer to the question &#39;why does the vampire want coffee?&#39; is &#39;he doesn&#39;t&#39;. A partner is always a good way to force someone to do something; in the event that you can&#39;t do that, either (maybe his partner is a Dalek?), you&#39;d need to work in another character who they both have reason (social or employment-based) to try and help. Arrogantly. Anyway, I think the plot as it stands works well - Shimon&#39;s initial resistance, his reason for acquiescing, and his &#39;victory&#39; at the end (which makes me grin).<br><br><hr>
<br><br>There might still be a problem with Samantha, though she seems to be working okay.  <br><br>Quite literally, she needs nor wants anything but blood.  Well, she does have a fear of dying in Nosgoth, which translates into wanting to please the Flowers and keep her job.  <br><br>Samantha is the dominant partner, and is so uncaring for what Liz wants that she doesn&#39;t get dragged anywhere.  They also rarely go to the same locations of Headquarters.  (Samantha goes to the Watering Hole for blood and avoids the Cafeteria.)<br><br>I can mess with having the Foxglove Official ordering my agents to do the prompts.  I&#39;ll skip the one where they visit the Nursery because it won&#39;t be funny.</p>

            <p>The Permission Prompts were introduced for two reasons:<br><br>1/ To stop people from posting unsuitable stories and being denied Permission because they couldn&#39;t read our minds.<br><br>2/ To test your creativity.<br><br>A PPC mission will throw very strange things in front of your agents, and of you, the writer. <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JlTQzrnP34d4-VF_hmyfjziEYQQb5p2vKxcuClDDY6U/pub">See this mission as an example</a>. If your response to anything in the least bit unexpected coming up is to throw up your hands and say &quot;I can&#39;t write this!&quot;, you will not be able to write PPC missions. That&#39;s just a fact.<br><br>The Permission Prompts are quirky. They&#39;re unusual. But they&#39;re in no way impossible. For sure, there are a couple which impart emotions on your characters - but that&#39;s why they come in pairs, so you can skip those ones if you really want.<br><br>Still don&#39;t believe me? I&#39;ll prove it to you. Pick <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16KHFHT9Xy8gJoUDT5-cMbWIFXxZPw8PXj9Jzp36Vv5Q/edit?usp=sharing">any one of my PPC agents</a> - anyone on that list with a department abbreviation or &#39;Retired&#39; next to their name (the others are non-agents). Pick <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IE81HONRJnp0IaK92GvzyL00CZYNZG_pvdo93gRMIhY/pub">any TWO prompts from the list</a>. I guarantee you that I can write a short story using both of those prompts and that agent, whatever you pick. Because that&#39;s what being creative is all about.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Are you talking about the ours?

            <p>It had been quite some time since Selene Windflower had last needed to take a shower - it wasn&#39;t like she could sweat, after all. But the Mysterious Case of the Exploding Wraith (as Kaitlyn insisted on calling their last mission) had covered both agents in glitter, which Kaitlyn flatly refused to get all over the feeble shower in their RC. It had taken a fair amount of badgering, but eventually Selene had agreed to accompany her over to the washrooms.<br> <br>Which didn&#39;t mean Kaitlyn was entirely satisfied. &quot;You&#39;re going to shower wearing <i>that</i>?&quot; she demanded as the vampire stepped out of her changing booth.<br> <br>Selene looked down at her bathing suit. &quot;What&#39;s wrong with it?&quot;<br> <br>&quot;It&#39;s… you… compare and contrast, okay?&quot; Kaitlyn waved a hand down her own front. &quot;Bikini. Lots of skin. Easy to clean. Whereas you… sweet Nessa, would it kill you to show your knees?&quot;<br> <br>&quot;It&#39;s all I&#39;ve got,&quot; Selene said with a shrug, plucking at the neck-to-calf costume. &quot;I&#39;ve not really needed swimming clothes for… a long time.&quot; She reached up and brushed her fingers over the brass mechanisms on the side of her face. &quot;I&#39;m still not convinced this is a good idea.&quot;<br> <br>&quot;You&#39;ll be fine. C&#39;mon.&quot; Kaitlyn grabbed her partner by the elbow and dragged her towards the glass door into the shower room. &quot;I&#39;ve checked, and they definitely don&#39;t use holy water.&quot;<br> <br>&quot;Oh, joy, something else to worry about. You do know how to make me feel bucksome.&quot; Selene pushed the door open and peered into the steam, her hand creeping up to the brass Key again. &quot;Are you sure…?&quot;<br> <br>&quot;Quit being such a wet blanket.&quot; Kaitlyn planted her hands on her partner&#39;s back and shoved, sending the vampire stumbling into the showers. &quot;Pun intended.&quot;<br> <br>Selene tensed as the hot water splashed over her, but when nothing seemed to happen she allowed herself to relax a little. &quot;I suppose it isn&#39;t <i>too</i> bad,&quot; she allowed, stepping gingerly into the flow. &quot;And it will be easier than rinsing my hair in the sink.&quot;<br> <br>&quot;That&#39;s the spirit.&quot; Kaitlyn gave her a thumbs up. &quot;Maybe we&#39;ll even get to introduce you to soap.&quot;<br> <br>&quot;You are a very cheeky young whippy.&quot; Selene tipped her head back, letting the water run down her face. &quot;Now hush and let me enjoy-&quot;<br> <br>&quot;Seleeene.&quot; The word drifted through the steam, its origin invisible. &quot;Seleeeeeene…&quot;<br> <br>The vampire peered into the fog at the vague figure across the room. &quot;Yes?&quot; she asked. &quot;Do I know you?&quot;<br> <br>&quot;Of cooourse you know me.&quot; The figure advanced through the swirling heat, coming into focus: tall and pale, her long dark hair covering one side of her face, a strange light in her eyes. &quot;I&#39;m youuu, Selene,&quot; she said, and grinned, baring a pair of sharp fangs.<br> <br>Selene&#39;s hand whipped up to the Key. &quot;No,&quot; she whispered, staring at the advancing apparition. &quot;You can&#39;t be.&quot; Her shoulders trembled, the red glow of her eyes flaring up. &quot;You can&#39;t be,&quot; she repeated, raising one shaking hand. A dull boom rattled the shower heads, as of distant thunder. &quot;Go away,&quot; Selene ground out, &quot;go away, go <i>away</i>-!&quot;<br> <br>&quot;Selene!&quot; Kaitlyn lunged across the room and grabbed her partner&#39;s outstretched arm. &quot;<i>Selene</i>! Calm down! What&#39;s wrong?&quot;<br> <br>Selene stared unseeing over her shoulder. &quot;They were gone,&quot; she mumbled, &quot;I escaped them, but she&#39;s back, I&#39;m back, I can&#39;t-&quot;<br> <br>Kaitlyn glanced back at the figure, which had come to a stop a few paces away. &quot;Oh, take those things out, Hypatia,&quot; she snapped. &quot;Can&#39;t you see you&#39;re freaking her out?&quot;<br> <br>The apparition cocked its head, then reached up and removed the set of cheap plastic fake fangs from her mouth. &quot;Well, that&#39;s just silly,&quot; she said. &quot;Like, a vampire scared of vampires? What&#39;s even <i>with</i> that?&quot;<br> <br>&quot;That&#39;s clearly not what this is.&quot; Kaitlyn stepped in front of Selene and took hold of both her shoulders. &quot;Hey,&quot; she said, shaking her gently, &quot;snap out of it. It&#39;s Hypatia. You remember, the Arwen clone?&quot;<br> <br>Selene looked from Kaitlyn to Hypatia, then back again. The fire faded from her eyes. &quot;You can see her?&quot; she asked in a quavering voice. &quot;She&#39;s not me?&quot;<br> <br>&quot;Of course not.&quot; Kaitlyn patted her shoulder. &quot;She just had silly costume teeth in, that&#39;s all.&quot; She shot a glare at the other woman. &quot;Why she felt the need to follow us here to try and frighten you, I don&#39;t even want to guess.&quot;<br> <br>&quot;Hey, no fair!&quot; Hypatia pouted at her. &quot;I was here <i>first</i>. I just thought, when the vampire walked in, it&#39;d be, like, funny. And I had the teeth in already, so…&quot;<br> <br>Kaitlyn blinked. &quot;Why did you have vampire teeth in the shower? No, actually, forge-&quot;<br> <br>&quot;There was this party,&quot; Hypatia interrupted, &quot;out in New Cal, and I had like the best costume. Only I spilled the punchbowl when I tried to drink it, so I had to come and have a shower. That&#39;s called <i>logic</i>,&quot; she finished, fixing the shorter woman with a defiant look.<br> <br>Kaitlyn sighed and shook her head. &quot;It&#39;s called something,&quot; she muttered. &quot;See, Selene? It was a joke. Just a silly joke.&quot;<br> <br>The vampire finally tore her gaze away from Hypatia and met her partner&#39;s eyes. &quot;It wasn&#39;t funny.&quot;<br> <br>&quot;Never said it was.&quot; Kaitlyn patted her shoulder vaguely and stepped back. &quot;But can you stop looking so worried? It&#39;s making me want to hug you, and that&#39;s doing weird things to my head.&quot;<br> <br>Selene managed a slight smile, and stepped back under the flow of the shower. &quot;Okay,&quot; she whispered, pressing her hand over the gleaming clockwork Key. &quot;Okay okay okay. I&#39;m in control. I&#39;m me. There is no other. Okay. Yes. Okay.&quot;<br> <br>She closed her eyes, and for about twenty seconds stood absolutely still as the hot water tumbled over her shoulders. Then she nodded, looked at her partner, and smiled.<br> <br>&quot;Did you say something about soap? I think I&#39;m ready to learn.&quot;<br><br><hr>
<br><br>I deliberately made this &#39;prank&#39; one that would push Selene&#39;s buttons (<a href="http://twistedskein.webs.com/EndStorm.htm">see here</a> for the details on why), because it seems like you think vampires have to be inhuman monsters who are on a hair-trigger. I wanted to show something different. (And frankly, if you don&#39;t think you can write a vampire who doesn&#39;t straight-up murder anyone who looks sideways at her, I don&#39;t know why you&#39;d want to write her at all.)<br><br>Selene&#39;s Victorian swimsuit was born as a counter to the fact that I&#39;d just written the pair of them going into the shower; I didn&#39;t think nudity was particularly appropriate. I may have slightly overcompensated by covering her up so much, but it made for some interesting dialogue. I can also come up with at least three reasons for Selene to prefer that kind of swimwear, based on her personality and history; you can probably think up some of your own. One hallmark of a good writer is knowing when you don&#39;t <i>have</i> to say something.<br><br>Hypatia was perfect for this job; <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kuxWfToab9pbLyDMzZ1KWqWQetXLeldkLEBVTc51Jz4/pub">she&#39;s a ditz</a>. If I hadn&#39;t had her to hand, I might have used Tia Hyrax; she&#39;s thirteen, so would be more playful about it, but could still have done the same thing.<br><br>I&#39;m mostly happy with this fic. The main bit I have issue with is the very end - it&#39;s intended as Selene playfully (as much as she can) calling back to Kaitlyn&#39;s comments to let her know that she&#39;s okay, but I think it comes over as too serious. I&#39;m nearly certain Selene used to shower all the time before she went loopy and wound up with the Key.<br><br>The one thing I didn&#39;t manage to squeeze in was Kaitlyn&#39;s comment on Selene&#39;s costume: &quot;At least it&#39;s not black.&quot; Because it&#39;s not - it&#39;s red with little pastel-pink flowers all over it. It&#39;s a nice moment, and I have various scraps of writing which mention Sel&#39;s love for red-and-pink-flowered underclothes, but ultimately it didn&#39;t fit the story. Not everything has to go in every time.<br><br>As before, concrit is always welcome. :)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I am wondering again if Samantha was a good choice of character, but I like her.  Perhaps the bad choice is dealing with Legacy of Kain within the context of the PPC.<br><br>(There are humorus fics in the LOK universe, but most of them are good.  Most of the bad LOK fanfictions are taking themselves seriously.)<br><br>Having Samantha chase children is like letting a wolf loose in a deer pen and not expecting something horrible to happen.<br><br>((I know that Wolf Park in Lafayette, IN lets the wolves loose in the bison pen.

It wasn&#39;t often, after all, that you could even find fresh vegetables in HQ, and there was an interesting salad he&#39;d noticed on a mission in Dorthonion that he wanted to try. He&#39;d need grapes from the vinyards of Dorwinion (into the basket they went), celery from anywhere (a bundle of Sphinxian imports followed the grapes), and of course, fried-<br> <br>There was a <i>swish</i> from behind him, and a level voice said, &quot;Put down the mushrooms and step away from the shelf.&quot;<br> <br>Huinesoron turned slowly, and had to forcibly restrain himself from looking twice as far down as was actually required. &quot;Agent Kaitlyn,&quot; he said, doing his best to smile. &quot;It&#39;s been a while. Why are you pointing a stick at me?&quot;<br> <br>The not-actually-hobbit woman brandished said stick. &quot;This is a Muggle-use wand,&quot; she said, &quot;ten and a half inches of applewood with a unicorn hair core. It could blow your pointy ears clean off.&quot;<br> <br>The elf frowned. &quot;I thought those things didn&#39;t work in HQ. That&#39;s what you told me about mine…&quot;<br> <br>Kaitlyn rolled her eyes. &quot;That was a clever lie.&quot; Without looking away, she flicked the wand in the general direction of the end of the aisle. &quot;<i>Incendio</i>. Now hand over the-&quot;<br> <br>&quot;Hey! Do you mind?&quot;<br> <br>Kaitlyn looked round guiltily at the couple a few steps down. A tall, dark-haired man was patting out the flames on the hem of his coat, while the woman with him tried to stifle her laughter.<br> <br>&quot;I mean, I know I&#39;m a pyro,&quot; the man said, glancing up, &quot;but this is ridicu… oh. Priestess Kaitlyn.&quot;<br> <br>&quot;Um.&quot; Kaitlyn flushed slightly, and did her best to hide her wand without actually moving. &quot;Your High Priestiness. Hi.&quot;<br> <br>&quot;Just Dafydd will do.&quot; The ex-PPCer plucked at the charred edge of his coak. &quot;Ah, well, I needed a new one anyway. But,&quot; he added with a scowl, &quot;that doesn&#39;t mean I wanted you to set it aflame.&quot;<br> <br>&quot;That&#39;s his job,&quot; his wife said with a wink. &quot;Hi, Kaitlyn.&quot;<br> <br>&quot;Agen- um, Constance.&quot; Kaitlyn chewed on her lip for a moment. &quot;Sorry about the… the fire thing.&quot;<br> <br>&quot;Good.&quot; Dafydd let the blackened fabric fall from his fingers. &quot;Why the pyrotechnics, anyway?&quot;<br> <br>&quot;I think she was showing o- ah. That is to say.&quot; Huinesoron thought for a moment. &quot;We were having a discussion. It got out of hand. Greetings, sir.&quot;<br> <br>Dafydd seemed to register him for the first time. &quot;Huinesoron,&quot; he said, the Quenya name flowing smoothly in his lilting accent. &quot;<i>Elen sila</i>… well, no stars here, I suppose.&quot; He shook his head slightly, and then his gaze sharpened. &quot;Actually,&quot; he said, &quot;you&#39;re just the person to sort out a little dispute we&#39;ve been having.&quot;<br> <br>&quot;Oh, you&#39;re not going to--?&quot; Constance folded her arms across her chest. &quot;<i>Really</i>, Dafydd?&quot;<br> <br>&quot;What?&quot; The elf spread his arms. &quot;If you won&#39;t see reason, it&#39;s perfectly legitimate to ask a third party for advice.&quot;<br> <br>Constance snorted. &quot;A <i>neutral</i> third party, yes. Not another member of the Noldorin Supremacy Club.&quot;<br> <br>&quot;I wouldn&#39;t say I thought-&quot; Huinesoron began, but Dafydd barrelled right over him.<br> <br>&quot;It&#39;s not being Noldorin that makes me superior,&quot; he said, then stuck his tongue out at his wife before turning back to Huinesoron. &quot;Imagine, if you will, that you have been sent to hunt down a Suvian who utterly upends the entire history of our people. Do you agree that you would have a greater right to kill her than your partner,&quot; he waved one hand at Constance, &quot;who simply objects to the way her Lust Object is treated?&quot;<br> <br>Huinesoron considered this. &quot;It does seem rather more significant,&quot; he mused. &quot;I think I&#39;d certainly want to-&quot;<br> <br>&quot;Oh, come <i>on</i>.&quot; Constance planted her hands on her hips and scowled. &quot;You can&#39;t seriously value ancestry over character! I mean, would you say I had the right to the kill just because we were in one of my Dad&#39;s bo-?&quot;<br> <br>She stopped abruptly, ignoring Huinesoron&#39;s curious look, and turned to Kaitlyn. &quot;You&#39;re with me on this, right?&quot; she said. &quot;I mean, if the Suvian was meddling with Luthien or whoever, you&#39;d want to take her out, right?&quot;<br> <br>Kaitlyn held up her hands. &quot;Hey, don&#39;t drag me into this,&quot; she said. &quot;I&#39;m just here for the mushrooms. Besides, I&#39;m DCPS; I don&#39;t kill people.&quot;<br> <br>Huinesoron glanced at her, his brow furrowed. &quot;I thought you&#39;d transferred to Floaters.&quot;<br> <br>&quot;I&#39;m <i>temporarily assigned</i> to Floaters,&quot; Kaitlyn corrected with exaggerated precision. &quot;I&#39;m still a caseworker underneath. Just like these two,&quot; she flicked her wand at Dafydd and Constance,&quot; are still retired even if they&#39;re taking on this mission of theirs.&quot;<br> <br>The couple exchanged a startled look. &quot;We haven&#39;t got a mission,&quot; Dafydd said. &quot;What are you talking about?&quot;<br> <br>Kaitlyn glanced from him to his wife and back. &quot;The one you&#39;re arguing about,&quot; she said, &quot;with the elves and the Lust Object…?&quot;<br> <br>&quot;Oh, that&#39;s just hypothetical,&quot; Constance said with a flick of her head. &quot;It didn&#39;t come up when we worked together, so we never really thought about it.&quot;<br> <br>&quot;Then why <i>are</i> you here?&quot; Huinesoron put in. &quot;In HQ, I mean, now that you&#39;re retired.&quot;<br> <br>&quot;Because it&#39;s next to impossible to get groceries out of season in Malij,&quot; Dafydd said. &quot;Like tomatoes, or… mushrooms.&quot; He reached over and plucked the carton out of Huinesoron&#39;s hand, tucking it one-handed under his arm. &quot;See you around. Connie - <i>run</i>.&quot;<br><br><hr>
<br><br>This was fun. ^_^ Writing <i>should</i> be fun, and having a challenge - like shoving four characters and two dissonant scenarios into the same story - makes it more so.<br><br>Nor was it particularly difficult. Because I know the characters I&#39;ve created - hS is a Noldo trying to work through his superiority complex, Kaitlyn is a bouncy kid who really wants to be a hobbit - I knew straight away how to get them into this situation, and how it would unfold. hS has never shown an interest in cooking before - fine, I&#39;ll make it something non-Elvish (so he&#39;s experimenting) and specifically highlight that it&#39;s a rare opportunity. Send in the mushrooms, and the conflict is established.<br><br>I have to credit Kaitlyn for the idea of Dafydd and Constance&#39;s argument being hypothetical. I could have written it as literal (they&#39;re the sorts to push their way into a mission, and I could&#39;ve come up with something they needed to buy from the Store to make the kill), but it would have deprived me of the gag at the end.<br><br>In terms of the writing, most of this sprang full-formed. My original plan (&#39;plan&#39; in that it was the idea in my head when I started) was for Kaitlyn to blow up a shelf, and for her next line to be &#39;Hand over the mushr- omigosh I&#39;m so sorry!&#39;. I dropped that in favour of the continuity nods - except for Constance and Huinesoron, all of these characters have history with each other.<br><br>The final gag was a late addition, too. Originally, they were going to be in HQ to pick up the proper ingredients for <i>lembas</i> (which, again, you can&#39;t get in Malij), but the opportunity to slap on a cheeky ending was too much to resist. :)<br><br>This story (which clocks in at just under a thousand words) is sort of halfway between a Permission piece and a general ficlet. It takes a stab at introducing the characters - it tells you that Kaitlyn acts hobbit-like but isn&#39;t one, and throws Dafydd&#39;s personal superiority complex out there - and their relationships (the &#39;sir&#39; in hS&#39;s greeting to Dafydd speaks volumes), but it doesn&#39;t descend into &#39;as you know, we retired almost ten years ago now, because...&#39;.<br><br>Then again, it doesn&#39;t need to. Agent bios are there to catch anything untoward in your backstories and powersets; Permission pieces are supposed to show off your writing and your characters&#39; personalities. I think (hope?) I&#39;ve done that.<br><br>Concrit is of course welcome; I&#39;ll be inserting this story somewhere on my site (unless there&#39;s serious problems with it that I&#39;ve not noticed).<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>On another note, that&#39;s a hilarious little story. I was smiling pretty much all the way through it. It does help to know the characters, though--I would otherwise have been a little confused by some things like the mention of hS not looking down to Hobbit height.

            <p>...there&#39;s something wrong with the Fanfic Land and Fanfic World links. Specifically, of the links under &quot;Links&quot; on <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/FanficWorld">this page</a>, only the third one works. None of the stories are accessible.<br><br>~Z<br><br>PS: The table, on the other hand, is working well and is very, very fun. It&#39;s also made me realize that half of my agent pages (or so) are several years out of date, which...I mean, I knew some of them were a little out of date, but I didn&#39;t know they were <i>that</i> out of date.

            <p>Okay, there&#39;s two problems there. One was Webs, which I&#39;ve fixed. The other... is that FfW is built on Google Drive javascript and CSS files, which are no longer available.<br><br>This... may not be easy to fix.<br><br>Individual stories are still accessible; the addresses take this format:<br><br><a href="http://fanfic_land.webs.com/FfW/Story21-1.htm"><a href="http://fanfic_land.webs.com/FfW/Story21-1.htm">http://fanfic_land.webs.com/FfW/Story21-1.htm</a></a><br><br>I think I may just make a link repository for both sites, and then move the next Badfic Games (that I feel up to archiving) to a third site.

            <p>That being, Permission revoked on grounds of obtaining it when not only she wasn&#39;t supposed to be asking in the first place thanks to the ban, but also lying about the characters and manipulating the process would be reasonable to me.

            <p>After years of being in this community, I think what is now clear is that we are not equipped to work with you in a productive way.  I&#39;m sorry that&#39;s the case, and I wish it weren&#39;t true.

I don&#39;t want to see you hurting, either emotionally or physically, because of anything that happens here.  Your personal safety is far more important than anything else.  That is why I would like to ask you to give this community up.   Forget the PPC, forget everyone here, block the Board on your system if you don&#39;t have the will power to stop coming.  Live a happy and safe life with your husband, and forget us.<br><br>I want to reiterate that my intent here is not to kick you out, or turn you away from us, as any kind of punishment or attack.  I also don&#39;t want this to feel like a punishment for having autism, as I know that&#39;s not something you can help, and that you&#39;ve been working hard to be a part of the community in spite of it.  I want this to be a decision you make, to ensure your own continued health and life, and to leave a situation that isn&#39;t making you happy, and isn&#39;t benefiting you.  Please, do this to keep yourself safe.<br><br>—with respect, goodwill, and hope for a safe future,<br>doctorlit</p>

            <p>I think you were trying to use four random words here (to &#39;say something&#39;); however, unfortunately the first word (&#39;nitwit&#39;) ended up being an insult, which - given how pretty much anything can be used as an insult - ended up colouring the other words as well.

            <p>Again, from memory, but I think it&#39;s June and July of 2014.<br><br>I was wrong to think that I had to interact on the board to get permission.  It got worse as I felt more attacked and ignored.  There was a joke about how someone couldn&#39;t understand that my character was a Mary-Sue for five minutes, and then a vampire for five centuries.  It made me feel that I would be mocked for being weird, and increased the stress, which made it harder to communicate.<br><br>I think that there was no malice behind it, but it seems that having a problem with the permission process is a grave sin.<br><br>I began by being too open and honest about my plans.  I revealed that my first team wasn&#39;t my main team, and then was asked to use my mains.  It seems the only solution would have been to lie about who my main team was so that I could use my first team.  <br><br>That team was a lot more complicated, and didn&#39;t fit the prompts.  Bramandin had the flexibility to write whatever he wanted to know his characters.  zdimensia was stuck trying to know them outside of the PPC, which wouldn&#39;t have identified the problem, or writing them out of character.<br><br>I wrote that &quot;I don&#39;t want to use these characters&quot; and got no response.

            <p>zdimensia was banned.  She broke the ban and, thus, should be permabanned (I understand now that we should have been explicit on that point when the IP ban was put in place).  Bramandin is zdimensia (who came back under false pretenses to avoid being banned) and, thus, should be permabanned.<br><br>Also, I see a lot of people saying &quot;but Bramandin is trying&quot;.  I do not see anything of the sort.  I see the same behavior that we have always seen.  The &quot;trying&quot; was a facade that fell away when they posted this thread.  This is how she really feels.  She was upset because, in her mind, we were silencing her from saying how terrible we all are so we could repent.  She still takes no responsibility for their bad behavior, and instead are waiting for the PPC community to apologize for intentionally inciting her to behave poorly.<br><br>But the community did not force zdimensia to break her ban.  We didn&#39;t force her to create a sock puppet to get around the ban.  We didn&#39;t force her to, by her own account, attempt to manipulate the permission process.  We did not force her to lie repeatedly to the community.  She chose to do all of that.<br><br>I&#39;m personally done with this, and vote for an explicit permanent ban.<br><br>-Phobos</p>

            <p>I don&#39;t think the permaban angle was made explicit either when zdimensia was banned nor when she reappeared. I don&#39;t <i>like</i> the way she came back, but I also don&#39;t feel that retroactively imposing a permaban that wasn&#39;t clear at the time is... fair.<br><br>I also think - know - that zdimensia wasn&#39;t banned for being unable to listen; she was banned for racism and pro-Nazi statements. Neither of those have shown up anywhere near Bramandin, so I don&#39;t feel good about the idea of saying she&#39;s &#39;done it again&#39;, when she hasn&#39;t. (I know you haven&#39;t said that; I&#39;m just explaining my thought process.)<br><br>That said... I don&#39;t like Bramandin&#39;s behaviour in this thread. I don&#39;t like her behaviour in the Iximaz thread. I don&#39;t like her behaviour in the chat logs with Neshomeh, and I don&#39;t like her behaviour in her two failed Permission threads.<br><br>She makes all the right noises for someone who is trying desperately to understand why people are mad at them, but when people sit down yet again and explain it... she keeps making those same noises.<br><br>I don&#39;t know. It just feels like some of the ban suggestions across the thread are less &#39;ban her for doing bad stuff&#39;, and more &#39;ban her for not taking it back very well&#39;.<br><br>Let me be clear: I don&#39;t think Bramandin fits into this community at all. I think she should take the advice she was offered right from the start of this thread, accept that she&#39;s just not meshing with the PPC, and leave. But I don&#39;t know that I&#39;m able to vote for us forcing her to do so.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>...I can make a case for zdimensia/Bramandin being in repeated violation of at least 5 articles of the Constitution.  Most of which have nothing to do with their dodging of the ambiguous permaban.<br><br><i>Article 2)  Do Not Flame. You are allowed to disagree with people, but Do Not Flame. There is a distinct difference between &#39;I don&#39;t agree with your opinion and I think that your theory is factually wrong&#39; and &#39;You&#39;re an idiot and your opinion is built on lies and stupidity&#39;. If you find that you&#39;re hurling insults around, just stop. This even (or perhaps especially) applies if you consider yourself to have been wronged by another community member. If it’s a misunderstanding, a flame is an unwarranted attack. And if they’re deliberately trying to provoke you, attacking them is exactly what they want - and damages the community as a whole.</i><br><br>Repeated accusations of intentional wrongdoing about various members of the community constitute Flames, in my estimation.  Especially after it has been explained, several times, that those accused did nothing wrong.<br><br><i>Article 5)  If someone says something that seems offensive, but you’re not sure exactly what they meant, ASK them first, before jumping down their throats. Astonishingly enough, most people aren’t out to offend anyone. (If they are being deliberately insulting, believe me, you’ll have a lot of backup.) Don&#39;t be afraid to ask what someone meant - it isn&#39;t silly to want the full facts. Equally, if there has been an honest misunderstanding, accept the mistake and  move on. Apologies for making a mistake, and for being unclear, are recommended, but should not be demanded.</i><br><br>zdimensia/Bramandin repeatedly admits to assuming Bad Faith on the part of various members of the community, even when those members have explained their meaning.<br><br><i>Article 8) Wilful ignorance is not an excuse. If someone is ignoring the Constitution and claiming that they’re not really doing anything wrong - despite explanations to the contrary - that may constitute using up their chance. However, wilful ignorance on the part of the accuser is also not an excuse. If someone clarifies a genuine misunderstanding, continuing to push for an apology may count as persecution on your part.</i><br><br>Just...all of this.<br><br><i>Article 11) Thou shalt make thyself legible. Spell correctly and use good grammar to the best of your ability — remember, the PPC is a force for good writing, and that includes SPaG. Wherever you are in the PPC community, spell, punctuate and grammatise to the very highest standard. Occasional honest mistakes will be forgiven, of course — but everything else aside, it’ll be hard for everyone to understand you and respond to you if you go, &quot;OMG! I cant belive taht newst movie is out! Its so gr8!&quot;</i><br><br>I can read the words, but the sentences and paragraphs make no sense.  There are non-sequitors galore, accusations lacking context, answering questions that were never asked, and any number of other problems.  I can maybe understand that while a person is in the heat of the moment, but it&#39;s been days now, and it happens every time this type of discussion comes up.<br><br><i>Article 14)  Stick to one penname across the PPC as far as possible — or at least make it clear that the different names are still you. For instance, your Wiki user page should mention your Boarder name. Please don’t deliberately use multiple names — it’s confuzzling and pointlessly annoying to start an argument with yourself, and we can usually spot it. (Of course, if you’re role-playing, that’s a different matter entirely — see Articles 16, 19, and especially 29!)</i><br><br>Creating a new name with a new intro post to pretend to be someone else so you don&#39;t get banned.<br><br><br><br>This is the sort of thing I am having a problem with, but it has taken me this long to voice it because I had to research it.<br><br>-Phobos, resting his case.</p>

            <p>I mean, first off: I&#39;m not going to vote <i>against</i> a ban. I just don&#39;t think I could vote for it.<br><br>I think the problem I have with your post is that you&#39;re stretching the definitions of all the Articles you point at. I flat-out disagree with characterising accusing people of mistreating you as flaming; the others (apart from Article 8, which I will readily allow) really do feel like you&#39;re stretching for a reason to ban somebody you want gone. It doesn&#39;t feel like &quot;wow, that&#39;s a constitutional violation, we need to get this person out because they&#39;re messing up the community&quot;; it feels like &quot;wow, this person&#39;s irritating, let&#39;s boot them&quot;.<br><br>I&#39;m not saying that&#39;s what you&#39;re thinking.

            <p>I agree that I am stretching on article 2.  There wasn&#39;t textbook definition flaming.  However, we didn&#39;t figure that anyone would level repeated false accusations of harassment at the community.  It didn&#39;t need to be said because it was understood to be bad.  If we had said it, it most definitely fits under the spirit of article 2.<br><br>Delta Juliet disagrees with me on article 14 because it was made for situations where someone is sock puppeting.  The letter of the law is to prevent things like anonymously trolling the Board to make yourself look the victim.  It doesn&#39;t cover someone using a new persona to, by their own admission, avoid punishment that they think is coming.  We never thought it would come up.  It was known to be bad.  But that situation does fit under the spirit of article 14.<br><br>The point I am trying to make is that zdimensia/Bramandin does a lot of things that are known to be bad behavior but aren&#39;t explicitly mentioned in the constitution because we didn&#39;t think it needed to be said.<br><br>-Phobos</p>

            <p>Between my earlier observation that Bramandin and our community can&#39;t communicate effectively, and the points Phobos and Miah have made about Bram&#39;s lack of progress, I also support a permanent ban.

            <p>Right. Huinesoron&#39;s proposal included a clause that violation of the 12-month ban would lead to a permanent ban. No objection was raised by respondents to that post.<br><br>On the other hand, Phobos&#39;s survey, which was the method used to vote on the ban, contains no such clarifying clause. Since Phobos wasn&#39;t one of the people who replied to hS... I don&#39;t know.<br><br>My inclination, given Bramandin&#39;s poor reception to constructive criticism on her missions and her recent harassment of Iximaz, is to declare the ban permanent due to the violation, particularly after reading over Neshomeh&#39;s correspondence with her. However, I&#39;m torn. Bramandin has been making an effort to improve, it seems, and she&#39;s certainly not as bad as she was when posting as zdimensia. As such, my mind could be changed.<br><br>As a final note, directly to Bramandin: I&#39;m autistic, too. It&#39;s not an excuse. You can learn to be better, but here is not the place to teach you the skills you need. If you are to remain, you need to speak less and listen more, and continue to make a concerted effort to be better every day.</p>

            <p>People are angry. Do you understand why? If you can&#39;t demonstrate that you do and take the appropriate steps to reconcile with those who are angry, the dust <i>won&#39;t</i> settle until the banhammer has swung.<br><br>I believe that anyone can change.

            <p>I cannot speak for anyone else; however, I am not angry for any of the reasons you state.<br><br>I am angry because you show no respect for the opinions of others. Nobody has wronged you, and you have wronged others; people have told you so, but you can see no further than your own grudge.<br><br>I am angry because you have now twice broken your ban - especially so this second time, because you have lied to the community since your return.<br><br>I am angry because of how you treated Neshomeh when she tried to help you, even keeping secret your ban violation for you.<br><br>I am angry because of how you use your autism as a shield to deflect valid criticism of your actions. Again, I cannot speak for anyone else, but I don&#39;t believe there has been a thread debating whether to ban me (if there was, someone please link it, because that&#39;d be a hell of a thing to miss), so people are clearly tolerating me despite my own issues.<br><br>I am angry because you still aren&#39;t listening when people point out your troublesome behaviour. You don&#39;t consider what they say; instead, you deflect.<br><br>I am angry because you appear to be making no effort to improve yourself. You are blinded by what you view as an injustice against you, and you refuse to grow past it.<br><br>I am sorry that we cannot help you. I am sorry that the community failed you when you first arrived. I am sorry that the only thing that can keep you from harming the community further is the banhammer. But that is how it is. This isn&#39;t how it <i>had</i> to be, but it is how it has to be now.</p>

            <p>The point I wished to express was this:<br><br>I would say that there is a strong argument to be made that zdimensia/Bramandin is in violation of her ban. Like hS said, she was banned indefinitely after breaking the terms of her initial ban. That&#39;s what happens. That&#39;s what&#39;s <i>supposed</i> to happen. If you agree to T&amp;Cs and don&#39;t abide by them, you have to accept the consequences.<br><br>I also agree with doctorlit; the PPC can help as a support network, but it can&#39;t be a therapist. This person needs help, quite seriously, and we&#39;re not equipped to give it in a fit and proper manner. It&#39;s simply not fair on us to have to act as translators for people&#39;s mental issues, and I say that as someone who (as I believe I&#39;ve told you before) suffers from a litany of them myself. I find them extremely difficult to deal with: my depression is like being chained to a flat, grey rock, slowly turning through the depths of space; my anger is like a red-hot cannonball sitting in the pit of my stomach, boiling the blood around it; the two combine in exciting and sometimes explosive ways.<br><br>I&#39;m getting better.<br><br>You can, and you should, and you should because you can.</p>

            <p>The spirit of the ban may have been self-reflection, but that isn&#39;t quite the attitude I&#39;ve seen. Sure, there&#39;s been plenty of reviewing of your action, and the actions of others, but as you&#39;ve shown in this thread, you haven&#39;t learned from what happened. The fact that the temporary ban had to be changed to a permanent one, which you still did everything in your power to get around, proves that things have not changed. <br><br>The fact that every other post in this thread from you contains accusations at other members of the board is not reassuring in the slightest. <br><br>Maybe I&#39;m wrong about this.

            <p>I was witness to what happened during Bram&#39;s first attempt at Permission, while it was happening in real-time and certainly not after the fact. Granted, I did mess up big-time by yelling at her, but looking back at the thread I can say that she wasn&#39;t a victim necessarily. I appreciate that her mental health concerns are being discussed in a civil, tactful fashion, but constantly arguing back when faced with concrit, or ignoring it as has been done with the missions they&#39;ve published, is still not a good thing to do.<br><br>I&#39;ve had PM correspondence with this person before, and the response I got to my apology for lashing out at them was that she tried to shift the blame to the rest of the community. She hasn&#39;t once apologized to me for the things she&#39;s done wrong, and has instead tried to justify herself for their actions, which is something that my work supervisors have advised against doing because it makes me look like I can&#39;t take criticism. I don&#39;t speak with her often through PM, and I can&#39;t remember the last time I&#39;ve done so, but I just don&#39;t want to have to willingly put myself in a situation where I may end up snapping and causing another ruckus, because Arceus knows I&#39;ve been through enough of those. :/<br><br>As it stands, I wish to vouch for a final chance to give the olive branch to Bram, a last call for her to either make an honest effort to better herself as a person or, as has been stated multiple times in this thread, part ways with us without another ugly incident, which is more likely given the state of things. I know I called for her to be temporarily banned straight away that time, but if that were the case then I&#39;d have just as easily been given the boot as well for my own offense back then, and in light of this recent info I don&#39;t know if another temporary ban would be successful. Whatever the case, I hope she gets the help she needs with her mental issues, because that&#39;d likely be more productive than arguing on the Internet with the odds so badly stacked against her...</p>

            <p>But if you are viewing, and to bring up two of your main points, the banning and the Permission process as oppressive, then there is still an issue. <br><br>Events reached a point where a ban was needed. When the vast majority of people participating in a discussion have a serious enough problem with the discussion that they&#39;re asking someone to leave, that&#39;s not oppression. That is a sign that a large portion of the community has an issue with what you are saying or doing, and would like you to stop because the area is for them to enjoy as much as it is yours. To put it bluntly, while you enjoying the community is important, so is everyone else enjoying it, and if one person is making it difficult for a larger group of others, then that one has the problem, not the group at large.<br><br>As for permission, you mentioned that you had issues with the permission prompts and your characters, but didn&#39;t comment for help. When people pointed out difficulties, you said it would have been better to have lied about what characters you were going to use, as long as you could use the ones you wanted. This is not the fault of the community.<br><br>That in all of these cases, you rest the blame either on others or on the community as a whole is why I don&#39;t think you&#39;ve really learned. I understand that there are issues you have to overcome, bus as Scape said in the previous discussion, you can&#39;t use your own condition as a crutch. <br><br>I&#39;m sorry if this feels like an attack, but this is truly how the situation is coming across to me. The reference to BDSM was entirely unneeded and insulting, depending on where you fall on the subject.</p>

            <p>I did comment for help.  I&#39;m just pointing out the two times out of three that I could have done something more.  I said more later, mostly when explaining why I was writing without permission.<br><br>That&#39;s mostly the myth of zdimensia.  Something was said to her, she responded, if there was any reply at all it was TLDR she must be trolling.<br><br>There was one more thing that never occurred to me, other than lying.  I could have gone &quot;Screw what little feedback I got from the PG, I&#39;m going to ignore it and do what I want.&quot;<br><br>I&#39;m not arguing that I needed to step back.  I&#39;m arguing that I volunteered to step back and they felt I needed to be punished for that.<br><br>Sorry for mentioning BSDM.  I draw parallels to try and understand the world.  Are the song references bad, as well?<br><br>I still don&#39;t understand how I am to blame for the actions of other people.  While there were things that I could do, they could have done more.<br><br>I&#39;m rising to my condition, which unfortunately means that I must go against what I think is proper and just be direct, even if that isn&#39;t proper either.  </p>

            <p>First, my confession: I have known that Bramandin is zdimensia since approximately September of last year. I&#39;m sorry if anyone feels that this was a betrayal of trust, or if my silence otherwise caused anyone any harm. I didn&#39;t say anything about it because I was told in confidence, and because Bramandin had already been around for about half a year at that point; since she&#39;d been doing fairly well, I didn&#39;t believe that spilling the beans so long after the fact would be worth all the drama it would entail. Since the secret is out, I am no longer bound by those concerns, so I will share what I know. I have told Bramandin/zdimensia I would do this; it should come as no surprise to her.<br><br>I have a record of the e-mail correspondence I&#39;ve had with her. It&#39;s in a Gdoc. I&#39;ve done my best to preserve the original formatting, and I have deliberately changed only a) places where I accidentally switched from my &quot;Internet&quot; e-mail address to my &quot;real life&quot; e-mail address, and b) places where Bramandin reveals private, personal information that she has not yet mentioned on the Board. Since she has now shared her diagnosis and the fact that she went to the hospital around the time of her ban, that information does appear. The bits I&#39;ve removed are clearly marked as redacted.<br><br><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/14DdtiB76_lUnlnFZyuW2tBUhXRO_niEcTssgQNOYiEE/edit?usp=sharing">Here is the document</a>.<br><br>I leave it to the PPC community to evaluate what they find there for themselves.<br><br>Due to my involvement, I will not participate in any formal vote on what is to be done now. However, I will say that at this point in time, I agree completely with doctorlit: I do not think we have the resources to give Bramandin the kind of assistance she needs to participate fully, happily, and safely in this community. I cannot myself be a full-time <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=308610;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">mediator and translator</a> for her, and I don&#39;t know anyone else who can, either. I believe it would be best for her if she gave us up and found another way to express herself through writing.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

All right. I apologize for my ignorance, and I am sorry for your distress. It was never my intent to give you pain. However, saying that I abused you is insulting, offensive, hurtful, and false. If you want me to bury the hatchet, you&#39;re going to have to change your mind about that and take it back. <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=308541;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board;pagemark=25">You&#39;ve said you want to be friends</a>, but a few shared fandoms alone isn&#39;t enough of a foundation for friendship. Trust and respect have to exist on both sides, and right now, that is not possible.<br><br>One more thing. I want to talk about the word &quot;like,&quot; since that seems to have been a serious bone of contention for you. &quot;Like&quot; is a real workhorse of a word. It does a lot of different jobs in this language. It&#39;s a preposition, an adjective, a noun, a verb, and an interjection. It&#39;s got at least 40 definitions, according to <a href="http://www.dictionary.com/browse/like?s=t">Dictionary.com</a>.<br><br>I was using it in the second form, third definition, &quot;to prefer.&quot; You did not prefer any of the prompts. You did not find any of them suitable for your purposes. You did not wish to use any of them. Right? Therefore, you did not like them. It is a completely normal and expected use of the word to which no reasonable person should have any objection. It&#39;s you who keeps insisting it carries emotional weight. Sure, it <i>can</i>, but it doesn&#39;t have to.<br><br>I used a simple, common word in a way that most people understand perfectly well. The fact that you have a problem with it reflects on you, not on me. Please adjust your perspective accordingly.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

<br><br>I&#39;m not continuing to insist it was abuse.  I acknowledge that it was a mistake.

<br><br>I did prefer the prompt that I used for Kim.

            <p>So, several years ago, I was here. (Except under a different name, that I&#39;ve long since forgotten but that&#39;s another story.) So I&#39;m TVTropes trawling, spot the PPC, and decide to pop back in to check.<br><br>Is everything still the same (relatively speaking)? Agents still underpaid and overworked? An HR system run like Nelson&#39;s Navy (on Saturday we&#39;re willing if you&#39;ll take the Flower&#39;s Shilling, to make an Agent of any one of you)? Getting leave a combination of threatening your boss and acquiring new Agents?</p>

There is a theme to the people I will allow at my party, and your job is to figure it out.<br><br>All you need to do is reply to this post (or my latest post in the thread), with the subject line &quot;Can I invite X?&quot;, where X is the name of the person you want to invite. Throwing in a &#39;from [canon]&#39; is useful, too, and please make it someone I can look up (ie, someone who has an article on a decent wiki somewhere).<br><br>I will either reply with &#39;Yes, you can!&#39;, or &#39;No, but you can invite&#39; and someone else who <i>does</i> fit the theme. And then someone else replies with their next proposed guest.<br><br>If you think you know what the theme is, suggest a guest who meets it, and give your guess at the theme in your post. Be sure to stick it behind a spoiler block, such as this one:<br><br>Spoiler SPOILER spoiler spoilER SPOILer sPoIlEr SpOiLeR spOILer Spoilerman Does Whatever A Spoiler Can don&#39;t spoil my er How do you solve a problem like a spoiler?

When a few people have gotten it right, I&#39;ll confirm it. :)<br><br>You can invite someone from any canon (though steer clear of real people).

            <p>I have no idea if this is right or not, or even if I am on the right track. However I believe that I know what it is that connects everyone who is currently invited to this party. That&#39;s enough words to remove any chance of spoiling it for others if it is the right guess. Right? <br><br>So I think the theme is that every person invited has a distinct physical characteristic. For example Darth Vader&#39;s suit, Harry Potter&#39;s lightning scar, Two Face&#39;s two faces... etc. <br><br></p>

            <p>Tomorrow is my baby brother&#39;s last day as a junior. *sniffles* He&#39;s growing up so fast. He&#39;s looking forward to the summer—and next year, since he&#39;ll be going from all AP classes to just one.<br><br>As for myself... after listening to all my friends, both IRL and in the PPC, complain about college finals, I&#39;m so very happy I don&#39;t have to deal with that stress. Instead, I get to run around at a Beatles music festival in the rain and thunder, holding a camera and hoping it doesn&#39;t get soaked. The weird thing is I&#39;m actually looking forward to it even though I&#39;m sure my feet will be extremely muddy by the time we&#39;re done. ^-^</p>

            <p>&quot;When I was your age, I went to a music festival in the middle of a thunderstorm! Etc...&quot; The thought makes me chuckle. Are you in agreement with me that the Beatles music festival is probably going to be one of the more memorable days of your life? (I mean, the rain is probably going to cause crazy/funny stuff to happen, given that it makes things wet and slippery, and the thunder only adds to the chaos.)<br><br>In shorter words, have fun!<br><br>-Twistey</p>

            <p>Hullo!  If you were here earlier this fine morning, you will have seen Huinesoron’s guessing game!  I enjoyed it so much that I asked for permission to host one, and he agreed!  I was going to wait for a day, but I got too excited (insert sheepish grin here).<br><br>Le Rules of Play:<br><br>There’s a theme to the people I will allow into the club meeting, and your job is to figure it out!  All you must do is reply to this thread with “Can I Invite [X]” (for example, can I invite Joker).  Specifying what movie/comic book trilogy/series they are from is helpful, and please make it someone I can look up easily (you’re welcome to make a short description of your character if you like, it would be incredibly helpful to me)!<br><br>Once you have done that, I will reply with either a “Yes, they can come” or a “No, but you may bring” and name another character that fits the theme.  Keep in mind it may not be from the same series/book/show/etc.<br><br>If you think that you have the answer, name a character you think fits the theme and tell me why (i.e. &quot;Darth Vader fits the theme because he has scars&quot; /OR/ &quot;I’m guessing Darth Vader will fit the theme.  Must all the allowed characters have scars to join in?&quot;  Remember, these are just examples.)  Be sure to put this guess behind a spoiler block!  Here is the example that Huinesoron used:<br><br>Spoiler SPOILER spoiler spoilER SPOILer sPoIlEr SpOiLeR spOILer Spoilerman Does Whatever A Spoiler Can don&#39;t spoil my er How do you solve a problem like a spoiler? Spoi spoi spoi spoi spoiler SPAAAAAAAACE! Sorry about him. ~spoiler block<br><br>Feel free to make it longer if you wish, just make sure that it’s fairly large!<br><br>Your character guess does not have to be accompanied by a theory.  You can guess characters solely to gather information and clues on the theme.<br><br>When a few people have gotten the theme right, I will give the answer. :3<br><br>You may invite a character from any canon (avoid real people).  If there may be doubt as to which canon your character comes from (i.e. LEGO Batman Joker and the Dark Knight Rises Joker) just be sure to clarify for me!<br><br>The Long John Silver mentioned in the title of this thread is from Treasure Planet, not Treasure Island.  Just so you all know.<br><br>And with that, let the guessing begin!<br></p>

            <p>It crossed my mind, but I ruled it out because I was thinking &quot;hybrid&quot; in terms of mixed races or mixed parts of roughly equal portions.

This week, they finally returned it... to Boone County library, Kentucky, USA.<br><br>Nobody knows how or why this happened, it&#39;s really surreal. Dudley library&#39;s theory is that they were worried about the overdue fine - but as they point out, that&#39;s actually capped at £4 anyway. ^_^ (You&#39;ll be pleased to know they&#39;ve said Boone County can keep the book.)<br><br>Meanwhile, Nokia are even more out of date - they&#39;ve just made a new version of a phone they phased out in 2005.

Meanwhile, there&#39;s been controversy: the bomber&#39;s name was shared with the US government, and leaked to the US media despite the police not being ready for it to be made public yet. Photos of evidence from the crime scene have also been leaked in the same way; coming on the back of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/may/15/donald-trump-shared-classified-information-russia-white-house-report">Trump&#39;s provision of highly classified intelligence to Russia</a> (which is widely accepted as having burned a key intel source), it&#39;s no surprise that we&#39;ve now chosen to stop sharing any information on the attack with America.<br><br>The (suspected) bomber, Salman Abedi, was 22 years old, British-born and of Libyan descent.

            <p>It was fun. I mean, seeing a ton of very similar snow-and-rock pictures in between the penguin pictures was less fun, but when the penguins show up...boy, do they ever show up. Also, I can&#39;t believe there&#39;s a penguin type called Macaroni.<br><br>~Z</p>

            <p>So the first two days of the tournament are qualifying rounds to get into the final tournament. They played six games and had to win at least four to get into the finals. They won five of the six. One of only three teams to do so. The next day is single elimination, and they lost in the first round, but that still put them at ninth. It is so exciting, and he has one more year to try again.</p>

            <pre><code>To the fandom news:&lt;br&gt;So Rey gets trained? Wouldn&#39;t that be useless, since she already uses the Force better than Luke did before he was trained? ;P&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Not-so-stealthy stabbing aside, Wikia&#39;s Fandom newsfeed has an article about how Wookieepedia came to be. It&#39;s a really interesting story; I&#39;ll put a link below my signature.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Funny story, when I saw Kylo take off his helmet, I expected his face to be all messed up like Vader&#39;s, so it was a definite surprise when he turned out to be completely fine and in fact rather handsome. I made a Scratch project out of it that day and made several people laugh.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;    To the Silly News:&lt;br&gt;What in the?! I have no words for either of these! XD&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;    To the somewhat humorous part of the Serious News:&lt;br&gt;Yup, we Americans can&#39;t keep our mouths shut about anything, especially any real-life occurrences that we can compare to fiction in any way. Life is a giant action movie when you&#39;re an American (or at least a stereotypical one), and we love spoiling everything for everyone. (Haha, I&#39;m thinking Hetalia thoughts while I&#39;m typing this. Hetalia makes everything better.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;    To the psychological part of the Serious News:&lt;br&gt;It&#39;s kind of the same stuff behind every other terrorist attack, or really anything destructive in general - for some reason or another, you feel as if the target deserves to suffer, and you feel it strongly enough that you put effort into actually making them suffer beyond bullying or harassing, instead of just fantasizing as teenagers are wont to do (part of why DAVD exists is teens writing fanfic about making their enemies suffer in the most gruesome and painful way possible). I&#39;m guessing the target here was something along the lines of the world itself, otherwise he would have been aiming for infrastructure like the 7/7 you mentioned or important buildings like 9/11 over here. Whether there was any mental disorder under all of this is not clear to me, since he was 22 and studies show that the human brain does not fully develop to adulthood until age 25. He could have just been immature and really, really fed up with life. Who knows - I&#39;m not a psychologist or anything, I just find it interesting to examine people&#39;s motives.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;    To the Not News:&lt;br&gt;The Vader facepalm, though.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;-Twistey&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Star Wars anniversary article/the story of Wookieepedia: &lt;a href=&quot;http://fandom.wikia.com/articles/40-years-star-wars-lore?src=swm&quot;&gt;http://fandom.wikia.com/articles/40-years-star-wars-lore?src=swm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Kylo Ren in a Nutshell&quot;, in case anyone wants to watch: &lt;a href=&quot;https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/92928830/&quot;&gt;https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/92928830/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The studies I&#39;m citing in the psychological thing: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=141164708&quot;&gt;http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=141164708&lt;/a&gt;

            <p>(This is probably going to come out wrong and make me sound really messed up, but we&#39;ll go with it.)<br><br>Part of why most of us don&#39;t understand why someone would do something like that is because we&#39;re lucky enough to be in a state of mind where we see other humans for what they are - people with feelings and thoughts. In order to conduct one of these attacks, often times the attacker has to lose sight of their target&#39;s humanity before they follow through with the attack, otherwise they&#39;d just talk themselves out of it. (Although there are some cases where the person does the thing, heavily regrets it, and then does something to sabotage themselves, usually suicide, although there are some cases where the killer kills themselves for a different reason and ahhh it&#39;s just complicated.) While these kinds of attacks are indeed very dastardly actions, it doesn&#39;t take as twisted of a mindset as people think, let alone pure evil - we&#39;re all pretty much human, and everything we do is for a reason (which is why characters need reasons too. Psychology and fanfic go hand in hand! :D). No one is an entirely good or bad person, and thus morality is purely based on comparison, whether to the average, to another famous figure, or to one&#39;s own ideals. When enough people agree that the bad actions outweigh the good, judging based upon deeds and spoken words, they are deemed dangerous and are dealt with as such.<br><br>Argh, there&#39;s a lot more that I want to say, but that&#39;d make for a really long post, and it&#39;s hard to put it into more words. The human brain is a strange contraption, and as we develop as a species, it will continue to get stranger.<br><br>-Twistey</p>

            <p>Weirdly, the thing that caught my attention the most in your <i>Star Wars</i> post (at 3 A.M, in my defense) is that Captain Phasma is actually coming back.  I rather figured she was just going to be in <i>The Force Awakens</i>, and disappear.  Then again, I seem to have it in my mind that her actor is a fairly big name?  But I&#39;m not aware enough of Earth happenings to know who that is, or even if I&#39;m correct in thinking that—but if I am right, it makes sense they would want her to continue appearing.<br><br>I wonder if she&#39;ll be a minor role again, or if she&#39;s going to become a personal nemesis for Poe—a Boba Fett to his Solo, as it were?<br><br>I would love muchly for that old style of phone to come back in style.  I hate having a fragile mini-laptop in my pocket all day at work, having to keep it from bending or getting wet every moment.  My older phone was much more durable.  Then again, I do need the weather app to know the day&#39;s high temperature, so I know which animals need their misters turned on on a given work day. &#39;~&#39;  Guess I can&#39;t always get what I want, but if I try sometimes, I just might find I&#39;ve got what the animals need.<br><br>—doctorlit still thinks cell phone developers need to prioritize high durability over low weight and small size.</p>

Halloween (the holiday) is not a continuum, so there can be no fan fiction or OFUs written in it. <br>In addition, Iximaz says that not only is the mini-jack-o&#39;-lantern not their idea, but they also do not remember whos it is. If I wanted to add this to the Minis page on the wiki, what should I do?</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve been thinking about expanding the Mini page for a couple days now, with stuff like what to consider when inventing a new mini type and what kinds of misspellings generate a mini. However, I keep getting hung up on the fact that the Table of Contents is so huge and disruptive. I could keep it below the rest of the page content, but what I&#39;d really like to do is move the list to its own sub-page, Mini/List of Mini Types, with a link to the list from the main page. Is there support for this, or does anyone have any strong objections?<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Sorry for adding the table; that page was getting so long, it was getting frustrating to edit, and took a while to load in edit mode.  (At least, for me.)<br><br>But there&#39;s no denying that questions about mini types and creation are still some of the most frequent things for newer Boarders to ask about.

            <p>A few reasons for this:<br><br>1. They&#39;re unique to LoK. Sarafan, as humans (or even suits of human armor), aren&#39;t.<br>2. They also feature throughout the series (called &quot;the Unspoken&quot; or &quot;the enemy race&quot; at times, but still).<br>3. They&#39;re the ones pulling the Sarafan&#39;s strings, IIRC, making them bigger baddies.<br>4.

<li>True, it would be the same mini as for &quot;Bedknobs and Broomsticks.&quot;<br><br>That&#39;s why <a href="http://legacyofkain.wikia.com/wiki/Fire_demons_(SR2"><a href="http://legacyofkain.wikia.com/wiki/Fire_demons_(SR2">http://legacyofkain.wikia.com/wiki/Fire_demons_(SR2</a></a>)  probably wouldn&#39;t work either.  They&#39;d look too much like smaller mini-Balrogs.  ((BTW, for years I thought that mini-Balrogs were three feet tall, not eight feet tall.))<br><br>2. I agree.  There is even a mural of them in Soul Reaver, though I forget the explanation for it.<br><br>3. Just the Seraphan of Blood Omen 2.  The original order had nothing to do with Hylden.<br><br>4. This is a good reason.<br><br>5. Writing the mini-squids was fun, but I had extra problems.  The most important one was that they were immobile, much like tribbles.  In symbolism that the original squid was referred to as chatty, they would randomly make Tony Jay quotes, which meant extra work.<br><br>6. There is actually a joke that works well with Hylden.  Liz is going to wonder why &quot;Hylians&quot; doesn&#39;t spawn a mini.<br><br></li>

            <p>Their form in any canon is theoretical until they&#39;ve appeared in an OFU or a mission. They do frequently get discussed on the Board before their first appearance, but the mission or OFU is what makes them official (though even then OFUs will sometimes switch things up--see mini-tribbles becoming mini-Gorn in OFAS, for instance, IIRC).<br><br>I know absolutely nothing about Legacy of Kain, mind, including whether or not it&#39;s been missioned before (the list on the wiki page doesn&#39;t include it, so I&#39;m guessing it hasn&#39;t), but this is generally how things work. If it&#39;s had a mission with minis, the mini form is set; if it hasn&#39;t been missioned in a case where minis appeared, then the mini form isn&#39;t set. And if a mini form has been proposed and recorded... then going by the wiki page, the first mission writer or the OFU writer makes the final decision.<br><br>All of this is, in fact, on the wiki page, but why not restate it here?

Now that we&#39;ve gotten that cleared up...<br><br>I had an idea for a Lovecraftian/horror RP involving either an alternate universe of the PPC (e.g. EPC) or an alternate universe of the Boarders themselves (e.g. Plort.) Players can be either one of the paranormal investigators or someone on the side of the monsters (monsters, cultists, etc - since it&#39;s Lovecraft styled, the creatures are all essentially gods, and would probably be an analog for Mary Sues and other weird Internet stuff.) Or they can switch sides if they get reformed or possessed. Does that sound like fun?<br><br>-Twistey</p>

            <p>Just the same idea of monstrous gods that can make you go insane just by looking at them, and sorta exist pretty much everywhere in space time.

            <p>do a bit of research into Lovecraft, before doing a Lovecraft-styled RPG? Read the fellow a bit? Man&#39;s got some bloody well good stories, let me tell you!<br><br>I mean, Iunno. I say this as a turbosnob with zero life at all whatsoever, but there&#39;s a whole lot of things to Lovecraft&#39;s stuff beyond &#39;tentacleguy that makes you crazy when you look at him.&#39; Not that he owns the concept or will rise from the grave and slap you for doing it without researching or anything, but if you&#39;re stating him as an influence, it&#39;s helpful, y&#39;know? </p>

            <p>Okay, that seems like a good idea. Despite the fact that the RP would take place in a new continuum, it would still be a good idea to research the original continuum so that stuff gets done right.<br><br>Do you have an idea about where I should start with my research? The stuff I know so far is that the Cthulhu mythos gods have a structured hierarchy (Great Old Ones, Outer Gods... can&#39;t remember the other kinds), there&#39;s <i>a lot</i> of them (I&#39;ve been to the list on Wikipedia, wow), they&#39;ve all got cat-on-keyboard names, you go insane looking at them <i>because</i> they&#39;re all so weird that the human brain cannot comprehend them... can&#39;t recall any more info, other than Lovecraft&#39;s work wasn&#39;t the most PC. But hey, look who&#39;s talking. Can I get a bit of guidance as to where to begin? If we get enough interest in this RP going, I&#39;ll let you be a moderator with me so you can give me a bit of help with regards to the canon I&#39;m basing on. I&#39;m noticing now that since the Lovecraft stuff is well-known literature, people often think they&#39;ve got the idea nailed and don&#39;t go in as accurately as they could have; thus, advice is appreciated. (Although that kind of &quot;slap Cthulhu&#39;s name on it&quot; stuff isn&#39;t all bad. Ahem, various Terraria bosses. :D)<br><br>Thanks for the advice!<br><br>-Twistey<br><br>P.S. I&#39;ve also started working on a story of another Lovecraft world, and I would share it with you to beta what I&#39;ve got so far, except it&#39;s on my Google account for school, so, y&#39;know, personal info. Hopefully this research and RP excursion will help me out.</p>

            <p>I wish I wish upon a fish. I&#39;m doing school stuff and I am, at this very moment, gearing up for one of those real work-heavy bursts, y&#39;know? I don&#39;t <i>dare</i> join another RP, as such, let alone moderate things! But good grief, would it be awesome to join. <br><br>And, yes! He was not PC. In fact, he is a git. I know, for certain, that he would probably hate <i>me</i> because not only do I not have a single droplet of New England blood in me (popping me in the &#39;potential cultist/cannibal&#39; area,) I have a parent with brown skin (popping me in the &#39;potential horrific eldritch abomination of gaping inhuman death&#39; area.) I don&#39;t, personally, think his stories are necessarily specifically aiming to be racist propaganda - as I see it, he really <i>was</i> genuinely interested in themes of inhumanity and alien-ness, the empty inhuman depths of space and such. It&#39;s just that, being racist, he tended to project those themes on other races a lot of the time. His stories, in general, have a far greater focus on those general themes, and he&#39;s a good enough writer that it usually doesn&#39;t feel, y&#39;know, weird. Except Shadow of Innsmouth. That one is <i>really</i> racist. Phew. But, yeah, I know people who sort of like to avoid that stuff, so if you sort of like to avoid that stuff, here&#39;s warning. I still do, personally, feel that the good parts are faaar worthwhile, in general. <br><br>But, yes! Research! The best research is, obviously, reading his stuff, which is fairly easy in Lovecraft&#39;s case, because the majority of his work is short stories. <a href="http://www.hplovecraft.com/writings/texts/">Here</a> we got a collection of electronic texts of his stories. It&#39;s public domain, so it&#39;s legal. This means you are not allowed to read them while wearing sunglasses and a leather jacket. <br><br><a href="http://www.hplovecraft.com/writings/texts/fiction/cs.aspx">The Colour out of Space</a> is the most <i>solidly</i> Lovecraftian short story you&#39;ll get - weird horror, blendings with sci-fi, set in classic Lovecraft country, another reason I don&#39;t want to spoil. It&#39;s bloody <i>good</i>. Genuinely one of his best. <br><br><a href="http://www.hplovecraft.com/writings/texts/fiction/dwh.aspx">The Dreams in the Witch House</a> is a jolly good showcasing of the element of witchcraft and sorcery in Lovecraft&#39;s works that is usually overshadowed by Oh No Tentacles. It&#39;s a brilliant reinventing of the idea of witchcraft from a weird sci-fi perspective, it is. It also explores Lovecraft&#39;s fascination and ideas on dreaming. Also it is good. That is important. <br><br>And then there&#39;s <a href="http://www.hplovecraft.com/writings/texts/fiction/dq.aspx">The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath</a>. Of all of the parts of Lovecraft that are overshadowed by Oh No Tentacles, it&#39;s his Dream Cycle that gets it the worst. Which is a shame, because the Dreamlands is one of the most fascinating fantasy worlds I&#39;ve seen, being totally separated from all that elves and dwarves, and having Lovecraft&#39;s styles of weirdness and horror. Dream-Quest is just like that - an oddly classic fantasy adventure, done in Lovecraftian style and creativity. It&#39;s, er. It&#39;s a bit long, but it&#39;s the Dream Cycle story I love the best and have read the most into. Lovecraft himself was pretty hard on the story, but shut up Lovecraft, you racist, <i>I</i> liked it! And, yes, it is, in fact, still connected to the rest of the mythos. <br><br>So those sort of cover a lot of his various facets, are fairly short (except for Kadath, whoops!) and are relatively not-racist (a sign of a great author, when that has to go into account.) A lot of the stuff on the gods and their hierarchy, as I&#39;ve found, was greatly added in later on by not-Lovecraft, and a lot of those writers were, er, not quite as good at Lovecraft with his ideas for the mythos. I will also recommend Mountains of Madness, The Rats in the Walls, and The Whisperer in Darkness and a bunch of other ones I can&#39;t remember. Of course, it&#39;s your own continuum, so you don&#39;t need to, y&#39;know, stick heavily to it or anything. But learning makes you smart, and everyone loves smart people. And if you&#39;re interested in those themes, it&#39;s good to actually <i>see</i> them. <br><br>Also, you considered making a personal Google account? I got a school one and I got a personal one, where I pop all my stories on. It&#39;s got a fake name and everything! I like to wear my sunglasses and leather jacket, while altering things in it.<br>And, er, pardon for taking a while. But, school and such. </p>

            <p>... I just went back and looked up that time Scapegrace hand-crafted Pokemon gyms for people (did anything ever come of that, Scape?). Aaaand I discovered that I&#39;d sent Dafydd in to snark about them.<br><br>So because I&#39;m a big fan of self-aggrandizement, and because people occasionally express a liking for Dafydd snark, and because content generation is <i>hard</i>, dangit, I&#39;ve compiled all of Dafydd&#39;s analyses into one easy-to-eat link:<br><br><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1d2g5DcYPCJgjnd3pdmgsvZ2FoqHrKxs2dEO76XvwLbc/pub">Thoroughly pointless, but might be fun</a>.<br><br>He names them, too.

And I shall point it at Morgoth and let it loose - and laugh.<br><br>((It isn&#39;t yours and you can&#39;t have one.))<br><br>Spoilsport. What about the... wait, I recognise this cat. It&#39;s Sauron!<br><br>((It&#39;s not Sauron. This is a different Alakazam.))<br><br>So it&#39;s a different cat? A lesser cat... a cat of Queen Beruthiel!<br><br>((No.))<br><br>But yes. And it is teamed with...<br><br>...<br><br>... what in the world is <i>that</i>?<br><br>((It&#39;s a ghost inhabiting a washing machine.))<br><br>That&#39;s ridiculous.<br><br>((I didn&#39;t make it up.))<br><br>... you know what, <i>fine</i>. It&#39;s a weird water creature with a shell, I&#39;m calling it Fastitocalon.<br><br>((I already have a Pokemon named-))<br><br>Okay, then I&#39;ll call it Turtle-Fish. And its fire-rock buddy can be... uh...<br><br>((I don&#39;t think there are any mythical creatures in Middle-earth like Heatran.))<br><br>Who says it has to be a mythical creature?<br><br>((That&#39;s pretty obviously your theme. But a Fire/Steel Pokemon doesn&#39;t-))<br><br><i>Hah</i>! So you say. But fire and steel? That&#39;s one of Morgoth&#39;s dragons, and that means I can call it a serpent of iron, after those that assailed Gondolin in the old tale.<br><br>((... those aren&#39;t mythical.))<br><br>What, the fantasy tanks that never showed up again? Sure they are.<br><br>Not that I admit to my theme being myths.<br><br>Next is a flying... thing. Owl, maybe? It has a certain unreal quality to it; I think I shall name it pretty butterfly-<br><br>((That&#39;s a Discworld character.))<br><br>-- all right, then it can be Princess Mee. Lovely, according to the poem, was she.<br><br>((You&#39;re really stretching this.))<br><br>Silence. The next item is a mushroom, or rather a tree, and that means it has to be named Entwife. I mean, it doesn&#39;t look much like them, but it&#39;s a plant, so it&#39;ll do.<br><br>And finally we have a... werewolf.<br><br>((Those are definitely real.))<br><br>Yes, you <i>would</i> know that, wouldn&#39;t you? Your vaunted Finrod found it out for certain.<br><br>((Do you have to?))<br><br>Yes. Obviously this Pokemon is as evil as the day is bright, and furry besides... I understand it&#39;s a shape-shifter of sorts, too, and cunning. If it isn&#39;t a werewolf, and isn&#39;t one of Beorn&#39;s kin, it must be a relative of Badger-Brock, Bombadil&#39;s foe.<br><br>((This is ridiculous.))<br><br>You&#39;re the one who said I had to link them all to mythical creatures.<br><br>((That is absolutely not what I said.))<br><br>You&#39;ve ruined your bed, now lie in it.

            <p><img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h259/TangledWebs/ScapegraceSnark.png"><br><br>There were seven kings in Beleriand in the greatest years of the First Age.<br><br>((Oh, no.))<br><br>As it happens, there are also seven Pokemon on &#39;Scape-grace&#39;s&#39; team.<br><br>((Oh, no, Dafydd, really--))<br><br>It seems therefore entirely appropriate to--<br><br>((Dafydd, Scapegrace already has a theme, they&#39;re all robots from--))<br><br>I didn&#39;t ask for your opinion. So! Toxapex. It looks like a mountain on the outside, but it has a frail little creature in the middle. Yes, it&#39;s covered in spikes, but ultimately, it&#39;s unable to defend itself.<br><br>((There is no way this will end well.))<br><br>In other words, it&#39;s Fingolfin. Holed up in Hithlum, he ultimately couldn&#39;t stand up to Morgoth&#39;s attacks.<br><br>((Neither could your grandfather.))<br><br>Huinesoron! That was hurtful and you should be ashamed of yourself.<br><br>((But... you...))<br><br>Next up is pretty little... ah, &#39;Peromosa&#39;, apparently.<br><br>((Don&#39;t pick, mistakes happen.))<br><br>Not to me. With that long, carefully-tended &#39;hair&#39;, this Pokemon can only be compared to Finrod of the &#39;golden house of Finarfin&#39;. As a bonus, it&#39;s a bug, and surely would love to live underground in a filthy cave like-<br><br>((Yes, you&#39;ve made your point.))<br><br>Third is Metagross, and I&#39;m sure I don&#39;t need to explain why it&#39;s named after Turgon. The rocky spines of its legs are a perfect mirror of the mountains of Gondolin, and unlike Fingolfin, it&#39;s actually able to make good on that promise.<br><br>Then there&#39;s a rather gorgeous Fire-type creature which must of course share a name with my own dear brother. Maedhros would... well, admittedly he&#39;d probably be quite put-out to know I&#39;d named a bug after him, but if he wanted a say in this he shouldn&#39;t have died.<br><br>Serperior... is Thingol. It just is. Look at it.<br><br>((... I can&#39;t argue with that.))<br><br>Then we have Hoopa-Unbound, which is not so much terrifying as overcompensating. With that ludicrous crown, it can be only one person: Morgoth himself, holed up in his dungeon quaking in fear.<br><br>((You&#39;re including <i>Morgoth</i> in this?))<br><br>I included Finrod, so it&#39;s not like I have a high barrier for competence.<br><br>((!!))<br><br>Finally, Tapu Fini. I admit I can&#39;t really tell what the design is supposed to be, but it looks something like a boat. By what would be happy coincidence if I wasn&#39;t such an expert at planning, the last king in Beleriand is Cirdan the Shipwright. Ta-da!<br><br>((... I will grudgingly admit that was impressive.))<br><br>You&#39;re too kind. No, actually you&#39;re not kind enough. Do better next time.<br><br>&gt;Dafydd</p>

O-kay, so first on Evil Uber... ah, EAIvil Ultra... <i>this person&#39;s</i> team we have a large, angry-looking dragon. It looks kind of like Glaurung, if Glaurung was actually intimidating.<br><br>((I don&#39;t think Tyranitar is a dragon...))<br><br>Nonsense; just look at it. I&#39;m going to call it Glaurung, and stay out of its way.<br><br>Then there&#39;s... is that what happened when Aule tried to make a mole &#39;better&#39;? It looks like his kind of design.<br><br>((I thought you liked Aule.))<br><br>His skill, yes. His design sense, not so much. I&#39;m sure I could&#39;ve done a better job of mountains, for instance. Honestly, you&#39;d think one of the creators of the world would at least know when something looked good.<br><br>Then we have--<br><br>((Aren&#39;t you going to nickname it?))<br><br>Why would I do that?<br><br>((Well, you... did before?))<br><br>Exactly. Next we have... a centipede. It&#39;s... just a centipede.<br><br>((It&#39;s eight feet long.))<br><br>So it&#39;s a big centipede.

Giant insects, giant lizards, giant birds...?<br><br>((That&#39;s... not precisely what I said, no.))<br><br>Something like that. I guess this team is themed around Big Stuff From The Dawn Of Time.<br><br>((That was <i>my</i> theme, actually.))<br><br>Then it&#39;s a stupid theme. Moving on, we have... a shark? Just... a shark?<br><br>((It has legs.))<br><br>So it does. A mutant shark, then. I mean, don&#39;t get me wrong, sharks are intimidating, but not so much as - what&#39;s next - as a... uh... that&#39;s a furry.<br><br>((Dafydd...))<br><br>What? I&#39;m not casting aspersions, but that&#39;s definitely a furry. With spikes on her hands.<br><br>((&#39;Her&#39;?))<br><br>Yes. After that we have a robot with giant claws for hands. Quite impressive, but not very practical, I can&#39;t help thinking. I would make a comment about those wings being far too small to lift it, but let&#39;s be honest here: it&#39;s a robot. It has rockets. It just does.<br><br>((I think it&#39;s supposed to be a bug.))<br><br>Look. hS. I&#39;ve gone through this whole thing without picking on you once--<br><br>((There was that whole &#39;Glaurung is a pushover&#39; thing.))<br><br>Your words, not mine. My point is, don&#39;t provoke me. Got it?<br><br>((...))<br><br>Good. And finally we have... a star. Looks quite nice. Hey, wasn&#39;t that your badge last time we did this?<br><br>((... kind of.))<br><br>Shows good taste.<br><br>Overall, this is a very dark-seeming collection. It practically oozes evil. Which is appropriate, I suppose, for someone who calls themselves Uber Evil Overload.<br><br>((That&#39;s not what he--))<br><br>Don&#39;t care, done now.<br><br>&gt;Dafydd</p>

People have learned to bend and follow the dark path of the Sith, and many come out as twisted and mind shattered corpses of the force. Only the strongest, only the most corrupted, only the most zealous become one with the Dark Side. And so many die after this.<br>While on a hunt for slaves of the light, the hated Jedi, a lone Sith apprentice finds himself on a disgusting world, with even more pitiful inhabitants...</i><br><br>@Neshomeh, since I&#39;ve been looking for a potential fic for us to mission together, are you familiar enough with Star Wars for us to tackle this thing? If so, I am so tempted to have the mission be titled &quot;May The Horse Be With You&quot;. XD<br><br>@everyone else, feel free to reply to this post with more badfics you&#39;ve found recently! Gotta give the Board at large some fresh sporking material, after all. ;)</p>

            <p>Let me know how well I chose these fics. These are all from the Circle of Lemmings.<br><br><a href="https://www.quotev.com/story/8652917/Alone"><a href="https://www.quotev.com/story/8652917/Alone">https://www.quotev.com/story/8652917/Alone</a></a> Naruto OC. The backstory&#39;s a bit angsty, and there&#39;s a little bit of uncanonical circumstances in this character&#39;s life. The description admits that this character is (or could be perceived as, can&#39;t tell) a Mary Sue, but incorporates a &quot;don&#39;t like it don&#39;t read it&quot; mentality.<br><br><a href="https://www.quotev.com/story/5314909/From-Hell-To-Heaven-BeeOC"><a href="https://www.quotev.com/story/5314909/From-Hell-To-Heaven-BeeOC">https://www.quotev.com/story/5314909/From-Hell-To-Heaven-BeeOC</a></a> I don&#39;t know too much about Transformers, but some of it seems a bit suspicious, and there&#39;s some weird grammar involved.<br><br><a href="https://www.quotev.com/story/9594281/The-fastest-girl-alive"><a href="https://www.quotev.com/story/9594281/The-fastest-girl-alive">https://www.quotev.com/story/9594281/The-fastest-girl-alive</a></a> DC OC. Even from reading the first few words, I&#39;m kinda cringing. I&#39;m not sure whether werewolves, vampires or demons exist in DC, but I&#39;m pretty sure that there aren&#39;t any <i>werewolf-vampire-demons.</i><br><br><a href="https://www.quotev.com/story/9564724/The-Tales-of-Evie-Cade"><a href="https://www.quotev.com/story/9564724/The-Tales-of-Evie-Cade">https://www.quotev.com/story/9564724/The-Tales-of-Evie-Cade</a></a> From what I can tell, this is a character who replaces Percy Jackson. Yep, y&#39;all can groan, we know who else replaces her canon&#39;s protagonist. I especially looked for these kind of fics to post here.<br><br><a href="https://www.quotev.com/story/6201083/Fairy-Tail-Little-Sister"><a href="https://www.quotev.com/story/6201083/Fairy-Tail-Little-Sister">https://www.quotev.com/story/6201083/Fairy-Tail-Little-Sister</a></a> Fairy Tail OC. Just from the description, I can tell it&#39;s Sueish. Another &quot;don&#39;t like don&#39;t read&quot; - those are fun to spork.<br><br><a href="https://www.quotev.com/story/9553430/Prophecies-Percy-Jackson-and-Harry-Potter-crossover"><a href="https://www.quotev.com/story/9553430/Prophecies-Percy-Jackson-and-Harry-Potter-crossover">https://www.quotev.com/story/9553430/Prophecies-Percy-Jackson-and-Harry-Potter-crossover</a></a> So, Kronos and Voldemort team up to catch this girl <i>why?</i> If PJO and HP existed in the same universe, a half-blood witch wouldn&#39;t be as rare as this fic implies.<br><br><a href="https://www.quotev.com/story/8243472/Hate-You-To-The-Moon-And-Back-Marauders-Era"><a href="https://www.quotev.com/story/8243472/Hate-You-To-The-Moon-And-Back-Marauders-Era">https://www.quotev.com/story/8243472/Hate-You-To-The-Moon-And-Back-Marauders-Era</a></a> Even just reading the disclaimer, I&#39;m cringing. James Potter having a sister wouldn&#39;t be so bad if she didn&#39;t have a severe case of time travel brain. It&#39;s called researching 70s music.<br><br>This is probably enough for one post.

            <p>Well, I don&#39;t really know anything about the SW Extended Universe.

            <p>I did skim through the fic itself, and I can say that it DOES provide a good dose or two of cringe later on - there&#39;s a flashback scene involving torture, which is probably why the gore warning was there - plotholes aren&#39;t resolved, and the author stated that they were going to accept OCs for inclusion at one point (though IDK if they got around to it, seeing as they stopped updating it later). So yeah, I think there should be some good sporking material to work with. :)<br><br>I understand that you&#39;re super-busy - I am, too - but I hope we can indeed work something out in the future once things clear up for us both. And yes, I wholeheartedly approve of Pony!Nume being a thing. XD</p>

            <p>I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m going to participate, so feel free to ignore me.  <br><br>Live action escape rooms are set up as re-settable puzzles for people to solve.  <br><br>I think it would be fun to put a bunch of agents into a puzzle room that they know is staged.<br><br>The assumption is that the agent is human, but they do not have to be to participate.  Like an Andalite would have to approach the problem like he only has five fingers.<br><br>It would be hilarious if someone destroyed something that wasn&#39;t meant to be destroyed, but it&#39;s not required.  <br><br>I&#39;ve read one-to-many stories about people who thought that sticking a knife into the live electrical socket was a good idea.</p>

            <p>Might end up with a little bit of trouble, though, since escape rooms are often sequenced (even if there&#39;s a few parts to one step that are interchangeable), and that would require for the admin of the RP to be railroading, which is widely considered to be a very bad thing.

            <p>Mostly I sort of hung around the board and talked with people, so I&#39;m not the most interesting of returnbies, unfortunately.  I tried doing a mission in collaboration with Al&#39;s Waiter for My Inner Life, but our schedules ended up getting in the way of it.  (I&#39;m not entirely sad about it, because it would&#39;ve meant reading through all of MIL and that&#39;s a level of masochism that I&#39;m not sure I can attain.)<br><br>I remember Al and Grey Lady Bast and some others being cool to chat with, especially for little high school me who didn&#39;t have many people to nerd out with.  So yeah, mostly I remember this board as being pretty chill.</p>
