            <p>I&#39;m new to the Board and the PPC in general, having found this place on TvTropes in the past week. Nevertheless, I genuinely care about what happens here and hope to someday bash fanfic in a similar manner to what already occurs. I am open to constructive criticism and am ready to discuss several semi-blip fic characters of mine.</p>

            <p>Welcome to the PPC! Come down from that pile of ceremony, have a sit. Wait, wait, no... don&#39;t sit over there. You&#39;ll get Spikes all over yourself and in some rather uncomfortable places.<br><br>Er. Not over there, either. That&#39;s where the fire stuff is; it gets used a lot and it isn&#39;t always put back right. Wouldn&#39;t wanna set yourself on fire so soon, would you?<br><br>Nonono, don&#39;t sit on the Dogpile, there&#39;s a person under there! Who is probably already having trouble breathing! Okay, look, there&#39;s a reasonably safe patch over there.<br><br>...no, wait. That&#39;s where we keep the alligators. Sorry about that; I guess all the safe spots are missing. Well, until you find a good spot, have a full set of space-themed roleplaying dice. Not too good for sitting but you can have a lot of fun with them!</p>

            <p>Hello, and welcome aBoard! For your newbie gift, take this plate of freshly-made SPaGhetti!<br><br>If you haven&#39;t yet read them, may I point you towards <a href="http://plotprotectors.tripod.com/TOS/">the Original Series</a> and <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=18hztHpDehxcfrjaXoFUew1vb0BdZPDAusHxMHzHiCzM">the Constitution</a>? They&#39;re pretty much the only required reading around these parts. Another useful resource you might use is <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/PPC_Wiki&lt;br%20/&gt;">the Wiki</a>; if you have any questions, just look here before asking. We like it when newbies do the research. ;)<br><br>(Just one little thing I&#39;d like to point out: we spork fanfic, not bash it. Bashing implies endless negative comments; sporking points out what went wrong and how it could have gone right but didn&#39;t. One&#39;s concrit, the other isn&#39;t.)<br><br>Anyway, tell us a little about yourself! Got some favorite fandoms?</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve already gone through the Original Series and the Constitution, despite not having much of an opinion on the Tolkienverse. As an aside, I&#39;m currently wading my way through the madness known as spring fever, along with the other eleven hundred or so students at my school. The fandoms I&#39;m currently in include but aren&#39;t limited to Five Nights At Freddy&#39;s, the anime canon of Pokémon, Undertale, andFuturama to a degree.<br>My apologies about the bashing.

            <p>It is, after all, not widely known, which does have a few benefits in our line of work.</p>

<p>Now, on to the actual question. About two and a half thousand years ago, from my perspective, there were several global catastrophes caused by various forms of advanced technology. As a result, an ancient tradition of mathematicians and theoretical scientists living in isolated communities called maths was ... well, the only thing we know conclusively is that it was revived, but, at the risk of starting an argument, I will say that it was forcibly reimposed. The avout, such as myself, who reside in these maths are sworn to follow the Discipline for some number of years. In the case of the millenarians, or Thousanders, the term is, rather unsurprisingly, a thousand years.</p>

<p>As far as I am concerned, the main drawback of the long term is that it is rather difficult to communicate results. However, to compensate, there were a few quite useful research programs we probably only managed to complete because no one could spread Sack-triggering rumors about them until after we were done.  </p>

<p>This is FicPsych Nurse Corinna Chan speaking. Agent Seeker, I so sorry for my adoptive daughter's pestering, she has just recently starting watching <em>Friendship is Magic</em>, and has become... extremely enthusiastic about it. It has made wonders for her mental state, yes, but once she discovered there were pony Agents, it has gone... slightly out of control. In fact, I have received a formal complaint from Agent Printworthy once because of that.</p>

            <p>I prefer to do my own grooming, but I'm glad you want to pamper me a little, Sashisaka. My cutie mark--a quarter note in a speech bubble--represents my love of reading and musical talent. Specifically, I can make magical stuff happen when I sing, and I feel like I should be able to play piano as well. I don't know how to attach pictures to this, so yes, it's true that I'm a unicorn pony.</p>

<p>The Notary</p>

<p><em>The Time Lord Inglorious, the Lonely Sod, known to the Daleks as the Oncoming Form.</em></p>

<p>Wobbles the Clown</p>

<p><em>The happiest, luckiest, and somehow also goest of happy-go-lucky children's party entertainers.</em></p>

<p>Algernon, 7th Earl Wymbourne</p>

<p><em>A man of decency, breeding, good character, and a tolerable skill as a practical magician.</em></p>

<p>Field Commander Lola McCandless</p>

<p><em>A woman of considerably less breeding, a complete lack of decency, and a tolerable skill as the commander of a ragtag organization devoted to shooting horrible gribbly space things.</em></p>

<p>Doktor Trollenfisch</p>

<p><em>The Department of WhatThe's resident neon-pink pufferfish with a German accent and a love of the <del>sousaphone</del> Biggenbrassenparpenthingen.</em></p>

<p>Gabrielle</p>

<p><em>An adorable and engaging little ball of cute with a dark past full of trauma and sadness; can you tell she was originally one of Ix's characters yet?</em></p>

<p>((One rule before we begin: I really must insist that messaging parties do not inform the Notary of Lola's existence within the PPC, and vice versa. There will be a story in which they meet; this ain't it. Sorry to be so blunt about it, but it does get irritating.))</p>

            <p>"The Commander and myself have primarily been working with teams sent to obscure fandoms whose power levels are rather more dangerous than initially surmised. Beyond that, I am given to understand that the Commander has been working closely with certain of FicPsych to set up a dedicated outreach-cum-demobilization program for refugee bits and OCs from militarily-inflected badfic worlds, a duty that hitherto has been left to more general practitioners of psychological medicine. For my part, my time has been taken up by building scouting reports for the Department of Intelligence in certain magic-rich continua; English magic is of a certain utility in such travails, being near-on undetectable, though limited in other means. When we have the leisure for it, the Commander and I often dabble in the other's interests: I am now a quite acceptable shot with small arms of various calibre and continuum, if I do say so myself, whilst the Commander's truly agile mind makes her a formidable theoretical magician and scholar of English magic. Her efforts to engage in practical magic are, for reasons I begin to hypothesize are related to her total lack of psionic capabilities and even Force presence, sadly unfruitful thus far; however, hope is the thing with feathers, as the poetess Dickinson put it. I trust this is a full and suitable answer for your needs."</p>

            <p>Hi, guys. Welcome to the PPC!</p>

<p>So, what's it like being a pair of DigiDestined in a place full of Pokémon? Have you met <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Sakimori">Sakimori</a> yet?</p>

            <p>I've been dying to meet you two! Well, okay, not literally, because that wouldn't have worked very well. I think. Would that have worked? Huh. Now I really want to know that, too.</p>

<p>But the question I would have asked originally! Rather, question<i>s.</i> I'm a little nosy. Sorry about that, you don't absolutely <i>haaaaave</i> to answer all of them if you're made a little uncomfortable. After all, it's not like you know me or anything!</p>

<p>One, what mission of yours was your favorite? Two, which mission was your <i>least</i> favorite? Three, for those times when you can't seem to get along and you're not on a mission, what do the two of you do? Four, what do you do when you can't get along and you <i>are</i> on a mission? Five, I've noticed you seem to spend a lot of time doing missions in the Harry Potter world - d'you know why?</p>

<p>I'll probably send more questions later, but I can't think of more now. (I would like an answer on the death thing though.) Cheers until then!</p>

<p>Was not. I was a bloody hobbit!</p>

            <p><i>Hi! My name is Calliope - I'm the new one. Lu (she's my partner) said that I was in charge of writing a response to this. I don't know why, I'm the one least able to answer your questions! But I'll do it as best I can.</i></p><i>

<p>Lu and I are in the Department of Floaters. As best as I've been able to piece the story together, Steele was Lu's last partner and they had a bit of a falling-out; I do know she was transferred to the Department of Bad Slash, and Lu says that's where she belongs. I get the feeling Lu doesn't like Steele very much, so I don't know how accurate the idea that she belongs there is.</p>

<p>My favorite drink is something I like to make every now and again - it's a mixture of apple juice and vanilla ice cream. It's super sweet and so incredibly good! Drop by sometime and I'll make it for you, I think I've finally got the recipe down. But when I can't have that, I usually drink whatever's in the fridge and looks good to me. Lu... I think she likes root beer. Or at least that's what I see her drinking. She doesn't really like to answer my questions about things, and she really doesn't see the need for me to know her favorite drink of all things.</p>

<p>As for the Sunflower's Witness, I had a strange dream a while back. Something about someone trying to kill someone the SW was protecting? It was a little strange and I forgot to write it down. I think Lu might have met the SW before I came here, but - well, like I said, she's not big on sharing.</p>

<p>It was super nice to hear from you, Dawn! Drop another hat in if you have more questions. Who knows, maybe Lu could answer them next time!</p>

            <p>I mean, things won't just fry because I'm looking at them, unless we're talking about real high tech, so I can buy groceries for instance but... Cell phones and credit cards, for instance, can go kaput in a matter of days, so as you can imagine, no using them. Computers can be forgotten too. And be damn careful when you go to the hospitals. Don't want to kill these patients needing life support, eh? And of course, that means things like X-Rays are way harder to use on you. Also, planes. No. just... No.</p>

<p>Heck, we got to aim or the older tech things, or the ones known for reliability if we want something not breaking up too much. Like Dresen's Beetle, for instance. Or use circles to try to keep magic energy away from them. Not that's always making lots of good, since we generaly have to ward our homes, and that always keep some magic inside. </p>

<p>And I'm supposed to have it relatively easy, since the hexing effect is lessened by how familiar you are with the technology. Better control of the magic helps too, but you needs being far more experienced than me, someone who was freshly out of apprenticeship. But... that's pretty much the point. Having magic is supposed to make you some sort of outsider for the rest of the society. From what I know, back in the past that was the disturbing look, souring milk of the neighbours, all these little things which indicated you had someone using magic around. Today, it's technology age. So that's the new thing. I wonder if I'll live old enough to see how magic will screw us up later, or if this techbane aspect will stick.</p>

            <p>I mean, I don't know any woman here in HQ I could date. Or at least, I'd know well enough to try (except Marina, and her answer comes next). I guess you would prefer if I named a specific person, but I don't think I can name someone out of the blue like this.</p>

<p>As for Marina, well she said she's not really interested in any sort of dating for now, despite all the teasing Agent Grey does, and talks having more than enough time to decide someday anyways (no, I'm not writing your entre tirade about Agent Grey).</p>

            <p>To Micheal, how in the world - or worlds, depending on the continuum - do you deal with a partner who can't seem to avoid getting himself killed? A partner who won't - or, to his credit, perhaps <i>can't</i> (medical issues are a possibility, I've met a few with them) - stay focused on what he really ought to be doing, for that matter. And how do those glasses of yours work?</p>

<p>To Apecian, how does that regeneration power of yours work? Has your answer to "Favorite Death" changed since the last time the question was asked?</p>

<p>To the both of you, are there any patterns in your work? Who generally takes care of charges and who generally takes care of assassination? Which continuums do you get sent to most often? Which continuums do you prefer to get sent to?</p>

        <div class="post-body">
            <p>Michael: On the first question, it was rather unsettling the first few times he died, but he has become more skilled at avoiding death, whatever he may claim, and I have become somewhat adjusted to it. I cannot say it doesn't disturb me to some degree, but that degree has gradually lessened over the course of our association.</p>

<p>On the second, he can focus. However, unless it interests him, he usually chooses not to. Therefore, I endeavor to make our missions as interesting as possible, and, when that fails... I endure.</p>

<p>My glasses, at the most basic level, alter the information entering or exiting my eyes. For example, my Tracker's Lenses highlight the point at which the soul and the sole of the person I am tracking met the surface they were walking upon, assuming they were walking. There are, of course, other means of transportation. Unfortunately, when someone takes them, it has a tendency to give one a headache. I do not recommend trying to track someone who has decided to go for a swim in the ocean.</p>

<p>Apecian: Well, basically, I've got a store of soul energy stored in my Philosopher's Stone. Not how Philosopher's Stones are supposed to work, but the idiot who made me didn't know that, and that's one glitter side-effect I don't want fixed. But, anyways, that energy is used to heal me whenever I get injured. As for favorite death? Nah, that one still rules. Seriously, it was awesome.</p>

<p>Michael: I have not noticed any patterns in the kind of work we receive, no.</p>

<p>Apecian: Unless you call the lack of pattern a pattern, in which case, yeah. Also, we usually don't ever get the same kind of thing over and over and over again. The one time we got stuck in a fandom for about a dozen missions, first it was a Sue, then it was Bad Slash, then Bad Slash again, then a Crossover, then a Troll, then Bad Angst, then a Sue again, and, well, you get the idea. Usually, I'm the one who kills the Sue, or whatever we're going for at the time, since if I mess up or she pulls a random power out of her purse, I'll be fine. Mike? Not so much. So he stands back and takes and reads the charges. Most of the time.</p>

<p>Michael: I am not sure if there is anywhere in particular that we are sent particularly often. We have a tendency to visit relatively obscure fandoms more often than those that are more popular. I would suspect this is because the Flowers have many Agents who can work in <i>Harry Potter</i>, but they have fewer Agents who can work in <i>Angel Beats!</i>.</p>

<p>Apecian: I'm not sure I've really got a favorite? I mean, it's great to see home sometimes, but other than that, I don't really have a preference, and besides, if I had to do one place over and over again, I'd get bored.</p>

<p>Michael: I have a few continua I enjoy visiting, but that does not generally affect where we go.</p>

<p>Apecian: Oh, come on, Mike! Don't dodge the question.</p>

<p>Michael: Very well. I do have a general preference for <i>Puella Magi Madoka Magica</i>, and I also enjoy visiting the world of Tortall.</p>

<p>((I should note that what Michael says about Lenses is part canon, part not. The bit about it altering the information entering and exiting the eye is canon. The bit about exactly how the Tracker's Lenses is something I made up and I hope sounds plausible.))</p>

            <p>Ilraen: This would not be an easy question for most Andalites, I think, but it is for me: I would choose my human form. I spend half my time that way, if not more, as it is. The adjustment would not be too difficult. I would miss my natural body, of course, especially the ability to run with Alice and my other friends in the Courtyard . . . and I can just imagine what Farilan would say . . . but, well, it is only a hypothetical question.</p>

<p>The tastiest thing . . . there was chocolate-covered ham at a Christmas party once. I think that is the most sensational combination of flavors I have yet discovered. Salty and sweet, smoky and a little bitter . . . yes, that was very good.</p>

<p>Alex: No, but if I had, I'm afraid they would be useless. You'd have to figure out which lottery they applied to, in what universe, and whether it's in my future, or yours, or someone else's . . . Precognition is really a useless talent in a place where time is in business for itself.</p>

            <p>That is a difficult question. I hope I can help you with it, if only in some small way.</p>

<p>People stare at me, too, though in my case it is often less about the scars themselves and more about the character they make me resemble. Most of the time, it doesn't bother me. There's no shame in bearing a superficial likeness to another person—and there's no shame in scars, either. However you got them, they prove you were strong enough, or at least lucky enough, to survive it. (For me it was the latter. I was young and reckless, and I could just as easily have paid for it with my life or that of my dragon.)</p>

<p>However, some days I would rather not be gaped at. On those days, I find a big, horrible grin to be quite effective at getting rid of people. Or, if I'm in a particularly foul mood, I stare back at <i>them</i>. If you don't know, I am blind in one eye, which makes my stare especially disconcerting. Most people give up and slink away pretty quickly.</p>

<p>You might also try simply answering the question they are too embarrassed to ask and tell them how you got the scars, as belligerently (or not) as you please. I have to start with "No, I'm not who you think I am," but regardless, after they quit stammering useless protests, the conversation tends to be painless and mercifully brief.</p>

<p>Of course, there is always the option of wearing a mask, but that's not for me, and I wouldn't recommend it. We are privileged to be in a position to demand that our fellow agents either take us as we are or go hang. Keep your chin up, and remember that no matter how much people look at your face, only you can let them get under your skin.</p>

<p>Ix, please write to me whenever you like. Corresponding with you is no bother at all.</p>

<p>Yours in solidarity,</p>

            <p>The last <i>Star Trek</i> prequel series was <i>Enterprise</i>, and we all know how THAT turned out. Additionally, one of the guys at the helm is the same guy responsible for the travesties of <i>Into Darkness</i> and <i>Beyond</i>. The whole thing is going through production hell, and frankly, none of it may matter, because the only way to even watch the show is on CBS All Access. Restricting your viewership is always a stupid idea, whether it's through awful and inconsistent time slots or through insisting that people have to be members of your private club to watch. (It's going to be pirated anyway, including by people who wouldn't normally stoop to that, simply out of frustration. <i>Game of Thrones</i> proved this.) The whole thing sounds like a recipe for crash and burn.</p>

<p>That said . . . the premise is interesting. From their vague hints, it looks like we may be exploring the Treaty of Armens, in which the Federation signed over several planets to the Sheliak Corporation. Perhaps we'll be focusing more on diplomacy than monsters of the week. The story is going to be told from the perspective of the first officer rather than the captain, which may offer fresh storytelling possibilities. We're definitely getting a more diverse cast and characters, finally practicing what <i>Trek</i> has preached all along. There are hopeful signs.</p>

<p>We'll just have to wait and see.</p>

            <p>Henry: I wanna go to Hogwarts and learn magic! I'm a wizard, you know. But <i>then</i> I wanna be an agent like Uncle 'Raen.</p>

<p>Gall: Yeah, he drops scales all the time. Kinda has to, since getting set on fire isn't exactly good for them. Some of the bigger scutes are cool, but mostly it's annoying. The little buggers get everywhere, especially when he full-on molts. Ugh. ... Why? Do you want some? What'll you give me for 'em?</p>

<p>(( Disclaimer: This is my headcanon as of this post. The HtTYD wiki didn't have an answer I could find [and it's horribly written], and I'm not caught up on the series. ))</p>

<p>Ilraen: A woodchuck would chuck all the wood if a woodchuck could chuck wood. ... Tongue-twisters are not so difficult if you do not speak with a tongue. This comes in very handy when reading <i>Fox in Socks</i> to small children for the nth time in a row.</p>

            <p><b>Durotar:</b> Well, this does seem to be a popular question.  We've delivered all manner of interesting things, as you can imagine.  The ones that stand out are the ones where you can feel something moving inside.  Best not to ask questions about what might be in there.  Especially when you are delivering it to Kitchen staff.</p>

<p><b>Kur'nak:</b> Ha!  Things moving inside packages is hardly the weirdest.  You know the Sunflower's subscriptions are weirder than that, and the things that Mary Sue Experiments and Research get...you know, the ones that sometimes leak through the box and smell like a child's perfume?...those are weird.  I still say that last one was an arm.  "Delicate Scientific Equipment" my ass.</p>

<p><b>Durotar:</b> Do you remember when we had to haul that giant box down to DoSAT?</p>

<p><b>Kur'nak:</b> The one that barely fit in the hallways and around corners?  Yeah, I remember it.  Did we ever find out what was in that?</p>

<p><b>Durotar:</b>  I heard it from one of the techs.  It was two AA batteries packaged in nearly a mile of bubble wrap.  That was the least stressed-out tech I've ever seen, by the way.</p>

            <p><b>Farilan:</b> I'm not particularly fond of humans. They look strange, and they smell stranger, and their arrogance is unbelievable! I suppose their ability to grip things with a greater strength is useful, though it's a rather unattractive holdover from their days as apes.</p>

<p>As for the second part of your question, kindly find the nearest airlock and throw yourself from it.</p>

<p><b>The Aviator:</b> Elanor's doing great. She's able to sit up on her own and she's been babbling almost nonstop over the last month. Zeb and I are hoping she'll say her first real word soon. (It's going to be momma. I hope.)</p>

<p><b>Charlotte:</b> So, uh, it's me answering, because my girlfriend's face turned about six different shades of white when she saw her question. So, yeah, I'd say it's too personal, but the official story is her neighbor's dog attacked her when she was a kid, and that's all you need to know.</p>

            <p><strong>To Ix (possibly via Charlotte)</strong>: Sorry about intruding like that.</p>

<p><strong>To Ave</strong>: That's good to hear!</p>

<p><strong>To Farilan</strong>:  I can understand that I (and other humans) look and smell strange to you. However, I don't appreciate seeing my entire species being called arrogent. It's rather speciesist. </p>

<p>I don't know your political stances, but if you generally support recent Andalite foreign and military policy, I'd say <em>you</em> calling <em>us</em> arrogant is rather hypocritical.</p>

            <p>She and I work in different areas of the department, so we don't see each other very much. I know Zeke runs off to play with Feysuei when he's not napping on my desk, but Liu and I don't really talk much.</p>

<p>...actually, I don't think I knew Liu's first name was Shui-Hua until today.</p>

<p>I don't talk to many of my fellow techies at all, come to think of it. I should probably change that.</p>

            <p>NASA&#39;s historic attempt to hold the sun hostage at gunpoint has, just a few hours ago, ended in failure, as the sun, unmoved by their megaphone-assisted threats and pointed Parker Solar Probes, simply disappeared over the horizon, leaving nothing behind but quickly fading purple marks on the few clouds in the sky. <br><br>&#39;It really was the last thing we were expecting - we never thought we&#39;d see that kind of action coming from the sun,&#39; said John NASA, current CEO of NASA. &#39;I mean, seriously, what the heck&#39;s going on, back there? I was really caught by surprise! I was all &quot;hey, what&#39;s it <i>doing</i>?!&quot; It just kind of sunk down, out of nowhere for no reason! It makes no sense! What would a sun even be doing down there?&#39; <br><br>When asked to describe the sun&#39;s unruly and unexpected behaviour, NASA gunholder, Rick Rocketman, described the celestial object as &#39;One loose cannon.&#39;<br><br>&#39;We&#39;re still not sure how it did it, but we suspect corporate espionage, spying, terrorism, corruption amongst our politicians, and quirky hijinks. I don&#39;t want to point any fingers, but I can&#39;t be the only one who noticed that the <i>moon</i> just so happened to appear, right after the sun&#39;s unlikely escape?&#39; theorised John NASA, clasping his hands into fists so hard they went white in an attempt to make sure none of the fingers pointed. <br><br>When asked about his plans to correct this catastrophic failure, John NASA only had this quote to offer: &#39;The issue of holding the sun hostage at gunpoint for three thousand and fifty-three dollars and five Overwatch Loot Boxes under threat of completely destroying it and all life in our solar system is a complex and confusing issue. But we do have one solution: we shoot it <i>twice</i>.&#39;<br><br><br>((So this is a weird, somewhat experimental thing. Not done it before, myself, anyhow. Might do it more, if it&#39;s not horrific tripe everyone hates?))</p>

<span class="short-post-author author-tag-for-16">HerrWozzeck</span>

        <div class="post-body">
            <p>Hey folks! So, for those of you who follow me, I may have mentioned the FBA, or the Furry Basketball Association in passing. And despite the fact I tend to talk about the drama that&#39;s happened there, I still think it&#39;s a pretty cool place where you guys can open your creative minds up for anything!<br><br>So, because of that, I have a proposition for you PPCers: you may not know this, but the FBA runs a draft every year, at which the community gets to add new characters to the player rosters. The form opened a little bit late this year, but we&#39;re still accepting submissions, and in fact we&#39;ll be accepting submissions until July!<br><br>So, if you&#39;re at all interested, here are a few pointers:<br><br><b>1) Hardcore sports knowledge is NOT mandatory.</b> It will certainly help, but it&#39;s not mandatory. Hell, I first jumped into the FBA not knowing anything about sports. The only thing you&#39;ll need for sports is knowing playstyles if you hope to develop a Top 24 Character, and even that isn&#39;t much of a problem: the Draft Form itself will have links to resources that can help you build your character, and the committee will contact you if you mess up some things.<br><br><b>2) The FBA is ICly big on diversity.</b> It&#39;s a heck of a place here, given that the FBA is very equal opportunity: it&#39;s a co-ed league, most of the players and staff members in the league these days fall somewhere on the LGBTQA spectrum, and international players from the UK through Camaroon and American Samoa all the way to Iran inhabit the league. So if you want to make an international character/a female character/an LGBTQA character, go for it!<br><br><b>3) No, there is no betting pool for money here.</b> (And yes, I&#39;m bringing this up: this was one of the first things my parents brought up when I told them about the FBA.) It&#39;s not just that this is a story clique that writes story: the amounts of conflict of interest would pretty much mean a betting league is out of the question.<br><br><b>4) No, you don&#39;t have to create a player character if you don&#39;t want to.</b> Some people find they fit better doing other things in the FBA. Hell, we have one contributor who basically has a jackal at NASA who just talks about space all day. So if you&#39;re not feeling especially confident giving a basketball player a spin, we&#39;re always looking for ways to flesh out the FBA universe! (And on a side note, this actually means you don&#39;t have to fill out a Draft form: just jump right in!)<br><br>So, if you&#39;re thinking about creating any characters lately, consider submitting something for the FBA today!<br><br>And as for the links, well... here&#39;s a link to the FBA&#39;s home page: <a href="http://furrybasketball.net/wiki/index.php?title=Main_Page"><a href="http://furrybasketball.net/wiki/index.php?title=Main_Page">http://furrybasketball.net/wiki/index.php?title=Main_Page</a></a><br><br>We also operate a chatroom on Slack, the link for which is on the FBA&#39;s home page. You&#39;ll need permission to get into that, though, but if you want to join in on the FBA&#39;s slack chat you can email <a href="mailto:dorourkie@gmail.com">dorourkie@gmail.com</a> for access to that.<br><br>And as for Draft stuff, well...<br><br>Here&#39;s the Draft Submission Form: <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeeQEMMzB3sfaAout6nkyv6SyexO7dg_uv5Za4op39eG5oaEw/viewform?c=0&amp;w=1"><a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeeQEMMzB3sfaAout6nkyv6SyexO7dg_uv5Za4op39eG5oaEw/viewform?c=0&amp;w=1">https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeeQEMMzB3sfaAout6nkyv6SyexO7dg_uv5Za4op39eG5oaEw/viewform?c=0&amp;amp;w=1</a></a><br><br>Here&#39;s a resource page for making a Draft Candidate: <a href="http://furrybasketball.net/wiki/index.php?title=Draft_Candidate_Resource"><a href="http://furrybasketball.net/wiki/index.php?title=Draft_Candidate_Resource">http://furrybasketball.net/wiki/index.php?title=Draft_Candidate_Resource</a></a><br><br>Here&#39;s Draft Express, a site that produces stats for incoming NBA draftees, and can serve as a jumping off point for creating FBA draftees; <a href="http://www.draftexpress.com/"><a href="http://www.draftexpress.com/">http://www.draftexpress.com/</a></a><br><br>If you guys have any more questions for me, throw them at me in the comments below!</p>

            <p>As Tomash pointed out <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?id=199610;article=306866;search_term=calling+my+ban+vote">when he announced his ban</a>, while the idea of his temporary ban was favored, there was never any consensus on the actual length.  Tomash himself called it a ban for “2-3 months” in the above post.

            <p>Heeeeey so.  For a long while now, I was kind of obsessed with my archival project, and haven&#39;t been reading new missions.  I&#39;m trying to dial back the monomania, and get back to writing my own PPC work, and also start reviewing newly published stories again.  This unfortunately means that for some Boarders, I&#39;m jumping back into their spin-offs &quot;mid-season&quot; with no idea what&#39;s gone on since I went coo-coo for archive-puffs, including yours, Skarm.  So the following reviews are from that point of view.  Sorry for any complaint or confusion on my part that stems from that.<br><br>Additionally, due to time constraints of work shifts, I read both of these interludes at work and wrote out notes  about stuff I wanted to mention, based on something I saw in the beta workshop.  Sorry if this makes my reviews a bit patchy, but it was the only way I could get this done during the work week.<br><br><u>&quot;Illogic Bomb&quot;</u><br>My favorite part of this story was the framing flashbacks taking place during Velociripper&#39;s origin badfic.  In addition to their base value of making a &quot;share my backstory&quot; story more interesting and unique, I really like the way you present them.  I loved the opening scene with Doctor Wu, especially with him being as in character as you write him.  Its quite fun for a canon character to &quot;guest star&quot; in an interlude!  I appreciate the explanations for why the park&#39;s dinosaurs are anatomically incorrect, too.   I also liked the juxtaposition of Wu&#39;s correct grammar with Tanya&#39;s spelling errors, hinting that there&#39;s a bit of canon blended into the fic here—and I also liked the little hint that Tanya&#39;s not entirely chained to her fic when she uses an apostrophe correctly to wave away Wu&#39;s reaction to her &quot;wacky&quot; laughing gas usage.  (That confused me at first, but I figured out eventually that Tanya is an <i>Incredibles</i>-verse Super with some kind of elemental gas-related power, yes?)  Although you kind of departed from that later with the bidder from Aperture, who doesn&#39;t talk with typos despite the fact that he must be an OC, since Aperture has no living human employees.  (Unless this takes place before GLaDOS took over?)  Oh, also, I&#39;m having trouble telling whether Ripper&#39;s fic was in the novel or movie version of <i>Jurassic Park</i>, since Hammond seems to sometimes have the movie version&#39;s personality (not wanting to sell the dinosaurs as weapons) and sometimes the novel version&#39;s (saying the public wants monsters rather than animals).  Finally, I liked the transition back to the present after the second flashback, when Rayner acknowledges that Ripper was just staring off into space, and that the bartender filled Rayner in on the info contained in the flashback, so that he&#39;s still in the same level of understanding as the reader is.<br><br>Moving on to the bartender, I didn&#39;t totally understand why Velociripper was so adamant about preventing Rayner from getting the guy angry by throwing the drink out.  Is this a character you&#39;ve used before who reacts badly to insults?  If not, it seems like an overly tense moment for the rest of the story&#39;s tone.  There&#39;s a contradiction about Jurassic Pond Scum, as well.  Early on, you imply it&#39;s alcoholic: &quot;&#39;I didn’t think you’d be the kind to drink anything alcoholi...il recently.&#39;&quot;  At the end, though, it&#39;s apparently not alcoholic any more: &quot;&#39;In that case, we’ll see which species is better at holding their G-rated alcohol counterpart. Bartender? Another Pond Scum for the Deinonychus, please.&#39;&quot;  You&#39;ve also made me look up and read &quot;A Sound of Thunder,&quot; which was fantastic, so thank you!<br><br>Your choice to present Ripper as transgender is an interesting one.  I was a bit put off by it at first—dinosaurs certainly aren&#39;t representative of the actual population of transgender people—but on further reflection, I see that it does work okay, if not, excellently.  We do know that some JP dinos changed sex due to population-based behavioral cues . . . I think to really sell this as a part of Ripper&#39;s life, though, I do think you should eventually write a story detailing what it was like for a sentient character to experience that change, as it would be completely unique (feeling the change happening on a biological level first, and changing the mindset later, as opposed to actual transgender people experiencing the dysphoria first and getting the sex change after).  Otherwise, it just feels like a tacked-on adjective.  (After all, Ripper didn&#39;t <i>need</i> to be one of the sex-changed dinosaurs; many remained female.)<br><br>Two more minor notes.  First, I like that there&#39;s an explanation for Rayner&#39;s bloodthirstiness.  It feels like it fits his character, and makes sense with the revelation (to me) that he&#39;s &quot;Rainbow Factory&quot; personified.  Also, in the sentence: &quot;His eyes met hers’, and he would swear his heart melted just a little,&quot; &quot;hers&quot; doesn&#39;t need the apostrophe, since it&#39;s already a possessive form.<br><br><u>&quot;Anthophobia&quot;</u><br>I have to admit, with all the time I spent &quot;away&quot; from your spin-off, I&#39;m disappointed that Rashida&#39;s attitude and treatment towards Falchion doesn&#39;t seem to have improved much.  I know partners aren&#39;t going to get along all the time, but I feel that in a healthy relationship, they ought to be arguing from equal footing.  Here, it feels like Rashida puts herself in a position of authority over Falchion.  Her anger also feels fairly mis-aimed and unnecessarily over-the-top.  Part of this is the fact that she&#39;s worried about his impending performance review, and insists he be thinking about job opportunities.  I know every spin-off has aspects that others lack, but the fact that most don&#39;t feature a business-formal review, or agents having <s>noticeable</s> jobs outside of being an agent, denies both topics some of the weight you&#39;re trying to give them in the text—I, as the reader, don&#39;t go in to the story subconsciously valuing those things, and that makes it feel like Rashida is overreacting over them.  Kind of the same thing as her ire at Falchion browsing the internet; they&#39;re not on a mission, or filling out a mission report, so is he really goofing off if it&#39;s clearly down-time for them?  I was amused by the not-porn fake out, though.<br><br>The idea that getting a bad review with the Flowers nets an agent more, harder work seems weird.  With the &quot;always understaffed&quot; running joke present, it feels like the Flowers would want agents where they&#39;re most useful, not put under-performing agents in a situation where they perform even worse— even if it means transferring an action agent to infrastructure.  (Yes, I know putting agents in positions they&#39;re ill-equipped for is a traditional source of humor, but this story has a more serious tone, so I&#39;m examining the topic seriously.)<br><br>I like your characterization of the Hyacinth.  You got the &quot;respectful, but stern&quot; trait down, and it&#39;s an excellent Flower to use for a performance review situation, as well.  You used the Nature mechanic from <i>Pokémon</i> in an interesting way, bringing up the question of whether Falchion was always Careful, and his file contained an error; or, if the game data&#39;s label of him never really applied, and Falchion&#39;s personality simply can&#39;t be fully defined by one of a set of arbitrary adjectives.  One noticeable lacking point was that the Hyacinth brings up working differences between Falchion and Ripper, but the conversation veers away, and the topic never gets addressed again during the review.<br><br>I think there&#39;s a contradiction concerning the relationship between Rashida and Falchion, specifically in the way Rashida views it.  Before the reviews with the Hyacinth, Rahsida is arguing for Falchion to take more responsibility, and asks, &quot;&#39;So why have you lost that willpower? Is it because you’ve been thinking of me as a superior rather than as an equal?&#39;&quot;  This seems to indicate that she sees a problem in Falchion feeling subordinate, and that that&#39;s part of the reason he isn&#39;t taking more responsibility.  However, after their reviews, she says, &quot;&#39;On the one hand, I’m not confident in your ability to take up that much authority just yet. I understand that you have one year of experience, but that’s as a subordinate to me, which is a natural way of thinking considering that I’m older than you by quite a margin and have more experience dealing with critical matters.&#39;&quot;  Now, she&#39;s saying that Falchion acting as her subordinate <i>is</i> appropriate, and that he isn&#39;t ready for more responsibility . . . Yeah, she&#39;s pretty much advocating for exact opposite agendas in the beginning and end, at least by my reading.  Is this intentional, with her review making Rashida go back on her views?  Or have I missed something huge?<br><br>Finally, some random little errors:<br>&quot;&#39;. . . and so little to keeping touch with others . . .&#39;&quot;<br>I usually hear this phrase as, &quot;keeping in touch.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Rashida had just shut off all of Falchion’s non-work-related browsing tabs.&quot;<br>This one may just be a question of local dialect and phrasing, but I&#39;ve always heard &quot;close&quot; used as the verb for, uh, closing tabs.<br><br>&quot;&#39;I may or may not have been underperforming because . . .&#39;&quot;<br>Since this sentence is part of Falchion arguing in favor of him accepting more responsibility, I feel like the &quot;may not&quot; is unnecessary and contradictory.  It also makes for a confusing double negative with the second part of the sentence, &quot;&#39;. . . not coming up with . . .&#39;&quot;<br><br>&quot;&#39;I guess have my question answered.&#39;&quot;<br>I think missed a word.<br><br>&quot;&#39;Gods, I’d better.&#39;&quot;<br>This might be really stupid nitpicking, but I wanted to bring it up just in case it wasn&#39;t intentional.  I noticed that Falchion swears by Arceus at least sometimes, but here, he just uses a more generic &quot;gods.&quot;  Does he switch it up sometimes?  Does it matter?  Do you wish I would shut up already?<br><br>I feel like my reviews got a bit unfocused and jumpy, being the results of bullet points being mashed together into paragraph form.  I hope they&#39;ve still been useful to you.  Please feel free to review the reviews!  I may be a little rusty, after all.<br><br>—doctorlit, slowly falling asleep in his chair</p>

            <p>First off, thank you for the kind words, and I completely understand your being busy. I am, too, at least most of the time, and I&#39;m glad to see that you&#39;re taking the time to look through everyones&#39; work while you have the chance, including my own! I hope I&#39;ll be more productive, writing-wise, when I start work next month. Hopefully. Anyway, onto the concrit responses:<br><br>Re: &quot;Illogic Bomb&quot;:<br>The flashbacks being used as a framing device was something I&#39;ve been meaning to try for quite a while, and I&#39;m happy that they apparently succeeded. Up to the point when I wrote the interlude, I hadn&#39;t really thought about the in-universe circumstances of Ripper&#39;s creation - his very existence is owed to a punny name suggested for that terrible self-insert of mine by my co-author, which I felt could be better used for a different character. Dr. Wu being his (her?) adopted/imprinted father was something I&#39;d been planning for a while and was intentionally chosen to both tie into the first <i>Jurassic Park</i> movie and conflict with his mindset in <i>Jurassic World</i>, to sow confusion in Ripper&#39;s mindset between his recalled origin story and the actual canon. The dinosaurs being inaccurate is something that&#39;s hinted at a few times throughout both the JP novel and the film franchise, though the Hammond referred to here is the movie version because it was the movie canon that got tangled up in the original badfic. Tanya&#39;s bad grammar was also intentional due to her mainly being written by my co-author, whose SPaG admittedly left much to be desired at the time; she is indeed from <i>The Incredibles</i> continuum and was the OC stand-in for Stormicide. I also didn&#39;t consider the fact that Aperture lacks human employees in canon, but now that you mention it, that&#39;s another great example of how little the universe of the badfic adhered to the <i>Portal</i> canon! (Seriously, it was just Chell, GLaDOS, and the Turrets, and everything else was just random cool futuristic tech. ^^;)<br>This is also the first time I&#39;ve written the bartender and though it may not be the last, I&#39;ll have to check with the people responsible for the creation of Rudi&#39;s in the first place to know what the standards of affiliates of the place. Ripper&#39;s insistence on courtesy is just a part of his own nature, since despite starting out as a villainous character who operated solo, I wanted to indicate that he takes ettiquette very seriously, since as <i>Raptor Red</i> demonstrated it could literally be the difference between life and death in dinosaur society. He always was intended as the most polite and courteous of the current Pack of #227, since someone had to fill that role for my DF team and as Ripper is also a Light expy I figured he&#39;d fill that role quite nicely. Also, another thing I hinted at was that Rayner&#39;s cider was also intended to be alcoholic, so I&#39;ll change the &quot;alcohol counterpart&quot; line accordingly. (also also oh gosh did your missing space lead to what I thought it did oh gods X&#39;D)<br>Ripper being trans was a decision I&#39;ve wanted to do for a while now because a) representation and b) it was my way of resolving the conflict with the first JP film canon that all the dinosaurs were (initially) female. I was worried that its reception would be a bit colder in general than what you&#39;ve said here, but your suggestion about exploring how it felt for Ripper&#39;s biological gender to change before his mental one is pretty darn brilliant and definitely something I&#39;ll explore in a future interlude, or even a future mission. As a member of the LGTBQ+ community myself (I&#39;m bi, though my parents still have a hard time accepting that), I&#39;ve been meaning to explore mishandling of LGTBQ+ in badfic for a while, and it&#39;s very possible that a mission focused on that topic could open up a lot of discussion regarding Ripper&#39;s gender change as well as Falchion&#39;s bisexuality.<br><br>Re: &quot;Anthophobia&quot;:<br>This is probably one of my weaker interludes, I have to admit, but if you&#39;ll excuse my being slightly argumentative I will argue that I wrote it with a lot of heart... possibly a little too much, actually. I based the interactions between Falc and Rosh pretty heavily on some of my own recent conversations with my parents, who I used as references for Rashida&#39;s behavior. One thing I&#39;ve noticed a lot lately is that, as you&#39;ve pointed out, Rashida is the one to take point when it comes to her relationship with her partner, and the above influence may in fact be why, since I&#39;ve seen her as being like a surrogate parent to him. It should also be noted that this interlude takes place shortly after the stinger of <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uTB1EUfroFvOtkdD8Bt451PIqgXXnkt4ph-OFoiaK_E/edit?usp=sharing">&quot;Sadly Mythtaken&quot;</a>, which occurred in December of 2015. This means that Rashida has only recently come out of therapy and hasn&#39;t had much of a chance to practice what she&#39;s learnt with her partner. It&#39;s likely that she&#39;s still working out how to resolve matters with him and he hasn&#39;t been helpful in her eyes, though I agree that unlike with my own responsibilities (I&#39;m expected to work constantly and consistently in a 9-5 job, rather than sporadic missions between off-periods like agents tend to get), she really would have no reason to be upset with Falchion browsing the Internet while not on Duty... though that could possibly just be Rosh being mad at Falchion for hogging the console when she needs it more than he does. Maybe. I still feel that a performance review would have at least some form of gravitas, though, since the Flowers are looking for quality agents and I figured that logically speaking, they&#39;d have to look over how they performed on Duty.<br>The thing I was trying to convey with the review and what the Hyacinth imposed on Falchion wasn&#39;t that Falchion was getting more and harder work, but that she wanted him to take more responsibility due to not doing so in times when he should have. I figured that since agents are supposed to be in tip-top shape on the job, slacking off while on Duty wouldn&#39;t be appreciated. Admittedly I should also have elucidated a little more on Falchion&#39;s team skills throughout the rest of the session, since that is indeed just as important as being responsible for your own duties, but it&#39;s also possible, and quite likely, that Falchion taking up responsiblity would mean a better working relationship with the rest of the team, since that way he&#39;d learn more about other people&#39;s importance as well as his own. The next mission I have planned is intended to explore his personality and characterization in even greater detail, and the feedback from this interlude may be helpful in planning how it goes down.<br>Rashida contradicting herself between the start and end of the interlude wasn&#39;t entirely intentional, but I was thinking along the lines of her wanting Falchion to be more responsible but at the same time, still being in charge of the Duty due to having more experience than him. I&#39;ve reworded the latter sentence to have her say that she DOES want Falchion to have more responsibility, but not to the point where he&#39;s taken over the Duty in its entirety, which should hopefully get the point across a little better.<br><br>Anyway, that should be it as far as responses are concerned. Thank you once again for your wonderful concrit, and I&#39;m glad you enjoyed the interludes otherwise! :D</p>

            <p>Regarding Velociripper&#39;s personality, that is an interesting take, especially on a character as stereotypically scary-looking as he is.  It actually feels like a bit of a call-out to the <i>Lost World</i> novel, where the raptor society broke down when their mortality rate increased to the point that adult raptors couldn&#39;t teach their children behavioral norms quickly enough.  I also didn&#39;t realize he was a Light Yagami expy, so that makes sense, too.<br><br>(Uh, what space did I leave out?  I&#39;m not finding it.)<br><br>I am sorry that my impression of Rashida was due to lacking info; I didn&#39;t realize, or maybe didn&#39;t remember, you had had her out of commission.<br><br>—doctorlit spent $48 dollars on books in a Goodwill today and he&#39;s only slightly ashamed</p>

            <p>I guess I could&#39;ve made that clearer in the interlude itself, but maybe I&#39;ll keep that in mind for the upcoming mission. And I didn&#39;t think about the Lost World reference for that aspect of Ripper&#39;s character, but come to think of it, that&#39;s probably another great reason!<br><br>And the words that were caught up by the censoring were &quot;alcoholi...il&quot; (sans space).

            <p>First above all... Sorry for dropping out of the radar for the last monthes. I was doing a stage for the second part of my master&#39;s degree, and has been pretty busy because of that. Now, I still have work tied to this to do, but I dare hope I can go back to our cowrite, depending on when you would also be free to work about it.<br><br>Anyways, I&#39;ll be off to read your stories right now.</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve been busy with my own IRL responsibilities myself, but I should be more available once work starts for me in July. Thank you as well for letting me know of your own concerns, and I hope we both can get the time to resume work on our co-write soon. As with the other collabs I&#39;ve been working on, it&#39;s been way too long! X&#39;D</p>

            <p>You can start giving welcome gifts of any sort the very day you show up on the Board, if you feel like it. I mean, don&#39;t give things that are in poor taste, but if we&#39;ve ever had that happen it was before I joined (which I did about four years ago), so don&#39;t worry about that too much. People give all sorts of things, too--I&#39;ve given bleep candies, Skarmory gives spikes (which I keep picturing as metal feathers? Not sure if that&#39;s how he means it), Sue objects are popular (and frequently invented on the spot rather than actually picked up from a badfic as an agent might do), and I remember getting a tribble when I joined, so you&#39;ve also got canon objects. There&#39;s quite a range. Go wild, find your thing--have fun.<br><br>~Z</p>

            <p>Since no one seems to think that my self-imposed exile after the doxxing (which, again, I&#39;m sorry for (and I regret that it contributed to a good few people leaving as well)) was insufficiently long, I guess I&#39;m back.<br><br>Since posting just that seems awkward somehow, I might as well kick off a discussion. What have y&#39;all been reading/watching/playing lately? <br><br>I read <i>The Way of Kings</i> a few weeks back (good stuff, would recommend if you have the time to read it), and I picked up a half-finished copy of Stephenson&#39;s REAMDE over the weekend (it&#39;s now half and a little bit finished). Surprisingly, I remembered the general plot despite not having toughed the book for a good while after I started reading again. I also discovered that my partly-finished <i>Portal 2</i> save had disappeared down an incinerator somewhere, so I&#39;ll be slowly working on that when I have time.<br><br>- Tomash</p>

            <p><i>The Way of Kings</i> is fantasy. The worldbuilding in well-done (and it&#39;s not a Middle-Earth clone), Sanderson does a good job of making you care about the characters, and, fair warning, there&#39;s few good places to put the book down (even with the fact that there&#39;s multiple interleaved narratives going).<br><br>I&#39;d give a trailer-ish block of text but I&#39;m worried I&#39;ll accidentally give spoilers.<br><br><i>REAMDE</i> is, distilling the first half, a somewhat sci-fi action novel. A very nerdy action novel (an MMO is a key setting). It&#39;s also very well-researched, and that fact is made extremely clear to you in the text (to be fair, from what I can tell, Stephenson has reined himself in a bit compared to some of his other works). </p>

            <p>Some of my recent stuff:<br><br>Finished <i>Eldest</i> not long ago (spoilers further down in this paragraph), as many of you in the chat heard me whining about.  It is definitely an improvement over the original <i>Eragon</i>, at least in the realms of world-building, and characterizing the side characters and giving them things to do outside of defining Eragon himself.  Nasuada is by far my favorite character in the series so far, the way she lost her father and got thrust into a position of power by the Varden&#39;s council, thinking they could control her, and then she just, &quot;No, pardon me while I Competent Ruler all over this place,&quot; and turns herself into such an incredibly powerful figure.  Roran is my second favorite, possibly just because he got so much page time away from Eragon.<br><br>Eragon himself is still an insufferable, thoughtless twit who talks too much and takes too much for granted.  I don&#39;t know why he&#39;s the protagonist instead of Nasuada.  I also didn&#39;t like how some of the Carvahall villagers, like Sloan and . . . the one lady . . . seemed more intent on spiting/revenge against Roran in the midst of a siege.  It&#39;s like, priorities, people?  I did like the long-time set up with Arya throughout the first book, where she was the only elf we had met, leading the reader to believe all her people were as solemn and austere as she is.  Then, we finally meet other elves, and they&#39;re instantly singing and dancing, all they&#39;re all just happy all the time.  That was actually a well-done fake-out on Paolini&#39;s part.<br><br>I also just finished <i>The Adventures of Pinocchio</i> (also spoilers below), don&#39;t judge me, I need to read and my need is deep.  It was actually bizarrely dark?  Like, I&#39;m not sure I would recommend it for actual children?  Which feels weird.  There&#39;s just a lot of violence in it, and Pinocchio kills the Talking Cricket with a hammer, and gets hanged at one point, and it&#39;s just . . . dang.  This was a kids book in early 1800s Italy?  Dang.<br><br>It&#39;s also very, very inconsistent about Pinocchio himself.  Like, he is made of wood, and displays borderline superstrength at some points due to the density of his skin, but he also gets hungry all the time.  So, is he wood, or does he have organs in there?  He also sometimes needs to breathe and sometimes doesn&#39;t, as he nearly gets hanged early on, but later spends about an hour under water with no trouble.<br><br>I may be overthinking a piece of outdated children&#39;s literature.  Sorry.<br><br>—doctorlit is a glutton and reads just about anything he can get his hands on, other than straight romance</p>

            <p>I&#39;m browsing Quora while checking up on the election in another tab.<br><br>I&#39;m not sure what I want to happen. I grew up in a house where one party is good and one party is bad, and that&#39;s it. I&#39;ve tried to understand other countries&#39; politics because that&#39;s important stuff to know, but growing up with such a dumbed-down system makes it hard to wrap my head around what&#39;s going on across the pond.

            <p>I think this is a very good turnout for the Labour party, all things considered. However, we comprehensively failed to capitalize on UKIP&#39;s predictable disintegration in the way that we might have done otherwise, and Scotland going blue in patches was frankly just plain weird. My own constituency stayed blue, with Craig &quot;Amazon&quot; Mackinlay&#39;s majority almost tripling due to a load of Tories coming crawling back after their flirtation with the Kippers, who were absolutely destroyed after netting a paltry 2997 votes with their candidate (a racist vicar) compared to 18,875 for Labour&#39;s Raushan Ara and 25,262 for the Amazon Man.<br><br>Still, one particular ray of light in one of my old haunts comes from the youth vote - which almost single-handedly booted Sir Julian Brazier out of Canterbury and turned it red. Canterbury is actually one of the largest university towns in the UK, so that very high student population managed to give Labour a seat that&#39;s been staunchly Tory since the end of <i>World War One</i>. If nothing else, that&#39;s worth celebrating. We also ousted May&#39;s Treasury secretary in Battersea, but Tories holding onto London constituencies (that aren&#39;t full of, and here you may freely assume the use of rhyming slang, bankers) is always a slightly dicey prospect.<br><br>Theresa May sought to bulldoze her opposition and shore up her legitimacy. This has not happened. I cannot stress that enough. She will be forced to compromise and do deals, which she&#39;s absolutely no good at; she may even be obliged to resign. She lost this election, she lost the Conservative majority, and hopefully Corbyn will harness that ever-fickle youth vote again in a few years to really press home and properly oust the Tories from power.</p>

            <p>Any non-canon character can see through the Somebody Else&#39;s Problem field. As IndeMaat put it in a mission, it&#39;s because the agents *are* their problem.<br><br>Also, don&#39;t worry about the time of day you post (apart from being coherent and so on). First of all, a bunch of us stay up late to begin with, for a variety of reasons. Secondly, Boarders are located in a variety of time zones: it&#39;s probably around 6:30 or 7:30 am in Britain now, for example, even though in some of North America it&#39;s 2:30 am. And if we have anyone in the same time zone as California, it&#39;s only 11:30 pm for them! Not to mention even more countries&#39; time zones which I don&#39;t have memorized... We&#39;re a pretty diverse group. There isn&#39;t always someone awake and checking the Board, but--and this is my third point--the Board doesn&#39;t always move all that quickly anyway. It&#39;s not like a chatroom. You may not get an immediate answer, no matter what time of day you post--but people will see your post the next time they check the Board, and it&#39;s unlikely to get buried too quickly.<br><br>~Z<br></p>

            <p>Hi guys. So I recently stumbled upon PPC while hunting for good fanfic. I read the constitution and started on the original series and I really liked it. English is not my first language, so I may make some silly mistakes. Please do point them out, I need to improve. My first language is Cantonese, and I speak mandarin and rudimentary Japanese as well. I look forward to having fun with you guys.<br><br>P.S. I might look for some help regarding fanfic I am writing, if that&#39;s okay. Some betas are saying my OCs are Mary Sues.</p>

            <p>Well my characters generally scored in the 22-29 or 30-35 range depending on how I interpreted the questions. I mainly clicked on awesome powers, tragic past, badass clothes, strong despite being looking delicate, and slight connection to the canon characters. <br>Anyways, here is a link to my character profiles, they are a bit long because I went into detail regarding usage of a few made up techniques.

            <p>Passed the second and third one, the fourth one doesn&#39;t apply to me because I did not create a kekkei genkai. The first one I am a bit iffy about, mainly because it assumes the OC was raised in one of the villages and born naturally, mine are synthetic like Mitsuki. It also accounts for only the Manga canon whereas I used a composite canon. I also did not do anything included in the rant. </p>

            <p>Maybe people think of your OCs as Sueish because of cliches and abnormalities, not actual overpowered-ness or canon breaking. In that case, be sure to check your OCs for anything cliche, and for all your OCs&#39; traits, if the same effect could be achieved without using an uncommon trait, alter them so you don&#39;t use it. For instance, I haven&#39;t seen too much in the backstory that depends on them being synthetic humans specifically (and I&#39;m still confused on why they have to be attempts at cloning a canon), so maybe they could be some other kind of criminal before they were caught and asked to work for Naruto and crew. Or maybe they could still be synthetic, just not cloning attempts; I think that connection to a canon is part of what triggers the &quot;Sue!&quot; response in most people, no matter if cloning actually can happen in canon. Let me know your thoughts.<br><br>-Twistey</p>

            <p>I guess is was my fault for putting there word clone in there, let me rephrase, they are synthetic people created with the DNA of canon characters as a base. Their abilities really does actually require them to be artificial; their abilities require specific bloodlines that don&#39;t have members married to each other, so I need them to be synthesized with specific clan combinations as a base.</p>

            <p>But still, is there a way to get through these challenges <i>without</i> creating characters that people accuse of being Sues? I gave you a few ideas in the doc. If you want to, you can read more missions so that you get ideas about how an underpowered character (PPC agent/Hypothetically!Your OCs) can defeat an overpowered character (Mary Sue/main villain) by outsmarting them.<br><br>-Twistey</p>

            <p>Well I do have to make my characters outsmart opponents either way. But, if I take away the stuff that makes them powerful, many people will question how my characters are even making a scratch, outsmart or no; it&#39;s not as if my characters have access to PPC technology. I have already limited their power to the minimum required to plausibly beat a Huckebein member via smarts; and, I have given them drastic consequences to using full power. I am really stuck on what to do, any less powerful and my characters have to rely on deus ex machinas to win.<br><br>If you want a reference to how powerful the villains are, check out the Standing in the Battledome portion of this link and maybe a couple of the Huckebein pages, especially Curren, Cypha, and DeVille:<br><a href="http://www.outskirtsbattledomewiki.com/index.php/14-fiction-profiles/525-magical-girl-lyrical-nanoha"><a href="http://www.outskirtsbattledomewiki.com/index.php/14-fiction-profiles/525-magical-girl-lyrical-nanoha">http://www.outskirtsbattledomewiki.com/index.php/14-fiction-profiles/525-magical-girl-lyrical-nanoha</a></a><br></p>

            <p>A good way to balance out power is to think like an RPG game: there&#39;s only so much XP to be gained per level (in this case, levels are years of training), and you can spend it all on one skill or you can spend a little on each skill you&#39;ve got, or any other combo. But you can&#39;t be a master of every skill you have if you&#39;re only at, say, level 2. So if you make your characters older (more levels), you can make them more powerful (more spent XP).<br><br>However, a word of caution. Since your fic is focused around battle and is a crossover between two worlds that have significant differences in what&#39;s considered normal for combat abilities, you must take extreme care with regards to this stuff, or otherwise your fic might just be doomed from the beginning. I thought about this overnight and at first I thought it was going to be doomed one hundred percent, but then I remembered that you seem to know what you&#39;re doing.<br><br>This is the only other advice that I&#39;m really capable of giving; otherwise I&#39;m out of ideas. It is good, however, that you started that other thread to ask for others&#39; opinions.<br><br>-Twistey</p>

            <p>I will keep all this in mind as I write. Also, that thread I started wasn&#39;t actually about my OCs, although there is a connection. I just thought it was unfair to many fanfic authors that their balanced characters get called out for having one or two outstanding traits, not necessarily my OCs which I know need a lot of work.

            <p>Yeah, there are people who call characters Mary Sues for one or two traits they have. The fact is that tropes can indeed be subverted - for example, many bad Creepypasta fan characters are catgirls, but I have drawn multiple legitimately scary catgirls that one would hate to be around in the middle of the night. (Although I think I overdid the wounds on one of them, because now she looks like a domestic violence victim; I should probably fix that.)<br><br>But back on topic, you&#39;re welcome for the help and, if all else fails, consider putting a disclaimer with reasoning behind your characters&#39; abilities at the beginning of your fic.

            <p>i am writing a Naruto fanfic with 4 OCs. The origin story is set after the Toneri incident but the main story is set 3 years after Momoshiki&#39;s attack. The timeline splits off from canon after Momoshiki, as in it ignores the existence of Boruto: Next Generation. It is going to crossover with RWBY and Lyrical Nanoha.</p>

            <p>I don&#39;t particularly associate with fandoms per se, it can get pretty toxic. Although I am a big fan of Nasuverse, Lyrical Nanoha, and Toaruverse. I am also quite knowledgeable in Naruto, Bleach and Dragonball. Also, while I can see that the PPC don&#39;t really like Eragon, it is a bit of a guilty pleasure of mine. </p>
