        <div class="post-body">
            <p>For the last few months, I’ve been re-watching the original four seasons of <i>Samurai Jack</i>, and finally got to watch the new fifth season, which I finished today.  It’s quite an exciting moment for me, actually.  I’m not sure I realized how much I wanted a conclusion to the series until I got down to those final five episodes . . . I’m not going to touch too heavily on the older seasons; I mostly want to focus on the final one.<br><br>Spoilers follow for <i>Samurai Jack</i>.<br><br><u>seasons one through four</u><br><i>Samurai Jack</i> really is unique among media.  Saying that it’s a cartoon really doesn’t do justice to the series or its creators.  While a lot of the episodes of the early seasons did tend toward the more cartoonishly silly, a lot of them are significantly more serious in tone.  SJ is an example of a series in visual medium that really couldn’t exist in any other; it relies too much, and makes too good use of, presenting image to the audience.  Color, lighting and motion combine with the musical score and the voice acting to create a unique emotional experience for the viewer, and I don’t think any other existing tv show has tried so hard to do so.  (I shudder to attempt a PPC mission in this continuum; I don&#39;t think I could do the mood justice at <i>all</i>.)<br><br><u>season five</u><br>This season was quite a trip.  In retrospect, I think I wish the entire series had been done in serial style like this, even though it might have lost us some good episodes.  After the decade-plus of wait, it was really nice to have a streamlined plot arc to follow on through this season.<br><br>Knowing that this season had been made for Adult Swim (cartoon network’s NSFW nighttime programming for not-children), I was a little worried that the tone would be too far-removed from what I remembered in my teen years.  This fear was quickly allayed by the introduction of Scaramouche, a robot assassin with a silly voice that can telepathically move objects through music. He was just the sort of nonsensical one-off robot bad guy we tended to see in the original run, and it was comforting to know the show wasn’t going for grimdark.<br><br>I loved all the more direct call-backs to characters and locations from the original run, too.  I especially love that so many of the people Jack had rescued over the years arrived in the final episode to rescue him, too.  It really underlined for me the real conflict of the setting: not Jack vs. Aku, but hope vs. Aku.  With Aku ruling over Earth for so many centuries, nearly everyone other than Jack had grown up in a world polluted by his power, that acceptance of his rule became one of his primary support structures.  The turning of the tide of opinion against Aku thanks to Jack’s work was something that got touched on occasionally in the original seasons, but is very strong in season five.<br><br>Aku’s voice . . . I feel like I’m being unfair, but I can’t help how I feel.  The original voice actor, Mako, passed away in between seasons four and five.  The VA they got to replace Mako . . . does a <i>really</i> good job, considering what a unique performance it was, but it’s just not quite there.  The new voice certainly has the gravelly register of the original, but not the range of cadence.  Aku sounds more bored and depressed all the time—and granted, he spends a lot of this scene in such a mood, but there are more triumphant moments for Aku when his voice needed to be higher pitched, and it just can’t get there.  I know it’s unavoidable, but it’s still disappointing.<br><br>It was interesting and surprising to see the depths to which the writers were willing to send Jack’s character.  He had nearly always been so stoic during the show.  Seeing his angry personality manifesting as a hallucination, and the literal specter of his failure to fulfill his goal, really drove home a sense of how the years with no time portal and no sword have worn away at his patience and hope.<br><br>I recognize the role that Ashi played in the plot of this season, but I’m not a fan of the romance that developed between her and Jack.  As an asexual person, one of my favorite things about the show all these years was the complete lack of romantic plot in it.  I just didn’t get any benefit from that aspect of season five, and it especially felt like it slowed down the third quarter of the season.  It almost made for a rather pointless slap in the face at the very end, when Ashi fades from existence as a result of Aku’s past destruction during her marriage to Jack.  It gets a little confusing, because if Ashi had never existed, Jack could never have gone back to change history in the first place, so it feels like she needed to continue existing?  Maybe that’s the reason for the delay?<br><br>That also leads into the next weirdness: the realization that all those friends who rallied to Jack’s aid in the final episode, now have never met him at all.  I wonder if Jack’s memories of being in the future will fade just like Ashi did?  Even so, I think Jack would content in knowing that he made the world a better place for all those lives, even if they’ll never actually know him or what he did.<br><br>—doctorlit, scratching a nostalgia itch<br><br>“You need to bring your best if you’re going to beat the samurai.  And the best parts of you . . . are spoilers!” “You need to bring your best if you’re going to beat the samurai.  And the best parts of you . . . are spoilers!” “You need to bring your best if you’re going to beat the samurai.  And the best parts of you . . . are spoilers!”</p>

            <p>Thanks for the assessment. My dad introduced me to the show a while back, and when I heard about the reboot, I was excited, but also a little worried. It&#39;s good to know that they not only stayed true to the spirit of the original (I&#39;ll have to assess Ashi myself because I happen to not be asexual), but also expand upon it. Where can I find the new season?<br><br>-Twistey</p>

            <p>Well, that&#39;s... kind of depressing, actually. Huh.<br><br>Anyway: yes! That story remains once-and-future canon, and doesn&#39;t need rewriting; it&#39;s not perfect, but I&#39;m still pretty fond of it.<br><br><i>But</i>, to mark the occasion, I will offer a sequel of sorts, set... well, now, but keeping to the spirit of Ten Years Hence. So:<br><br><b><u>Ten Years Now</u></b><br><br>&quot;<i>Bonjour, maman</i>!&quot;<br><br>&quot;AWWWWW! Elibabef, <i>I</i> was going to say it!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Now, now, girls.&quot; Elanor held her hands out placatingly. &quot;Don&#39;t welcome me home by fighting, <i>mes petites</i>.&quot;<br><br>Mary&#39;s face hovered on the edge of crumpling. &quot;But I! Wanted! To say it!&quot;<br><br>Elanor smiled and knelt down in front of her black-haired daughter. &quot;Then do. Or have you forgotten the words?&quot;<br><br>Mary&#39;s incipient tears transformed into a scowl. &quot;I <i>neber</i> forget,&quot; she said firmly. &quot;<i>Bon drawer, mum-on.</i>&quot;<br><br>Elanor worked hard to keep her amusement from her face. &quot;Very good; we&#39;ll make a French girl of you yet.&quot; Straightening, she walked over to Mortic and looked down at the baby in his arms. &quot;And how about you, Mark?&quot; she asked. &quot;Anything to say to me?&quot;<br><br>The not-so-little-anymore boy beamed at the sight of her. &quot;Mmmm!&quot; he babbled. &quot;Mmmm!&quot;<br><br>&quot;There, you see?&quot; Mort made a face that was at once exhausted and triumphant. &quot;I&#39;ve been coaching him all day, just so he could say <i>maman</i> to you when you got back.&quot;<br><br>&quot;That&#39;s very sweet,&quot; Elanor said, patting her husband&#39;s cheek. &quot;But I don&#39;t think &#39;Mmmm&#39; counts.&quot;<br><br>&quot;You question me?&quot; Mort pulled back, frowning. &quot;Me, who has seen nations rise and fall, yea, and the very mountains shift beneath-?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Stop exaggerating, o Mortic of the Order; it makes you look like a goose.&quot; Elanor took the baby from Mort&#39;s arms and smiled down at him. &quot;And <i>maman</i> has been working hard, <i>oui</i>, she has; she has no patience for Daddy Goose.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Mmmm!&quot; Mark said again, reaching one fist up to grab at Elanor&#39;s blonde hair. &quot;Mmmm!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Sorry, El.&quot; Mort rose from his seat, gesturing for his wife to take it. &quot;So how was the mission?&quot;<br><br>&quot;<i>Pas mal</i>,&quot; Elanor said vaguely, watching Mark&#39;s face. &quot;It was good to see the team again; there&#39;s not many of us who work in French slash, so we used to be pretty close.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Are you thinking of transferring back?&quot; Mort leant on the arm of the chair, shooting a quick, quietening look at Elisabeth and Mary as their noise level rose. &quot;I thought you liked the Nursery.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I do, I do.&quot; Elanor smiled up at him. &quot;Fear not, this was just a one-time thing. But it&#39;s always nice to see old friends.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I suppose so,&quot; Mort mused. He reached down to tweak his wife&#39;s hair away from their son&#39;s fingers. &quot;And, you know if you do decide to move back, I&#39;ll-&quot;<br><br>&quot;Mmmm!&quot; Mark stretched out for the stolen hair, his brow furrowing in concentration. &quot;Mmmm!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Mmm<i>maman</i>,&quot; Elanor said, taking his hand in hers. &quot;Come on, <i>mon petit</i> - say <i>maman</i>.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Mmmm,&quot; Mark replied, squeezing her finger. &quot;Mmmm-&quot;<br><br>&quot;I think he&#39;s still too young,&quot; Mortic began.<br><br>&quot;-mmmum!&quot; Mark looked startled, as if trying to squint at his own mouth, and hiccupped. &quot;Mmum! Mmmum-um-um-um-um-um-um!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Mark said Mum!&quot; Elisabeth ran over, dragging her sister by one hand. &quot;Mummy, mummy, did you hear, he said mum!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Mum!&quot; Mary repeated, beaming from ear to ear. &quot;Go on, Mawk - say mummy!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Mum-um-um-um-um,&quot; Mark said solemnly. Then, abruptly, his cheeks puffed up, and he burst into tears.<br><br>&quot;Oh, Mark...&quot; Elanor looked up at her husband and held the squawling infant out. &quot;Can you take him?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Of course, my heart.&quot; Mortic scooped the baby up and rocked him gently. &quot;Come on, little one, it&#39;s all right...&quot;<br><br>&quot;It&#39;s not <i>that</i> all right,&quot; Elanor muttered, scowling down at the floor. &quot;Three babies, and not <i>one</i> of them said it in French first? Honestly, I don&#39;t know why I even <i>bother</i>...!&quot;<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I had suspected it for a little while. After all, we&#39;ve got <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2-VqGcwXVU">jetpacks</a>, robots for doing household chores, and modern smartphones are actually more powerful than most older sci-fi imagined, but it&#39;s nice to get confirmation :)<br><br>My first thought on seeing that that we&#39;d caught up with the date  of a piece that was set in the future was &#39;It&#39;s like PPC history, but opposite&#39;.

Not just the future, but the cyberpunk future: 2019 is the year the original <i>Blade Runner</i> was set, and 2020 has <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberpunk_2020">long been associated with cyberpunk</a>. We&#39;re even approaching the earlier dates mentioned in the <i>Ghost in the Shell</i> backstory, I think that refers to events in the 2020s or 2030s. <br><br>-Irish</p>

            <p>There&#39;s no reason you couldn&#39;t just write an agent who exists in the present and has that as her backstory—except possibly for the &quot;just showed up in HQ&quot; part, since a much less contrived option would simply be to have her be a badfic rescuee. {= )<br><br>As for the partner, a formally published property that is a ripoff of another property is still a canon, unfortunately.

            <p>Re. the game, I don&#39;t know, but my instinct is that if it&#39;s not out and out plagiarism, it probably counts as a canon, much as we might wish it otherwise. Two-bit movie studios get away with this crap all the time; I don&#39;t see why it would be different for games.<br><br>As for recruiting canons, just because someone did a thing in the past doesn&#39;t mean it was a good idea. Sometimes we learn from our mistakes and <i>stop</i> doing things. {= )<br><br>Which reminds me: you were asking about Despatch in a previous thread. I could write this down there, but eh, I&#39;m here now.<br><br>So, the short answer is no, no one has done anything with Despatch in a very long time. The thing is, Despatch is tricky because it ostensibly deals with real people (self-inserted authors), and thus its missions would have to be handled with extreme delicacy. It&#39;s complicated.<br><br>Personally, I wouldn&#39;t object to seeing Despatch disbanded.  Trans-dimensional Hopping and Snatching aren&#39;t bad concepts as they refer to the antics of fictional characters, but as such, they&#39;re already covered by the DIC and/or DMS. Despatch was always a bit redundant, and since the in-universe idea was that it split off from the DIC at a time of departmental growth, it would make sense for it to close at a time of departmental shrinkage. I think retconning it to have happened around 2006 (when the Lichen got bumped from the Board of Department Heads) or 2008 (when the Department of Author Correspondence was officially shut down) would make sense.<br><br>That&#39;s my headcanon, anyway.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Sonichu&#39;s been regarded as off-limits basically forever, for the precise reason that it&#39;s nearly impossible to separate from its author and <i>we do not attack authors</i>. Especially not ones believed to be mentally challenged.<br><br>Normally you could make the argument that a fictionalized version of the author is not the same as the actual author and therefore this is as fair a target as any self-insert Suvian, but it&#39;s not worth it. Aside from the matter of scruples (which should be reason enough), there&#39;s also the fact that Sonichu is a beast, and it&#39;s a comic, so you&#39;d have to be more insane than usual to want to take it on AND have a phenomenal level of dedication to pull it off. Trust someone who&#39;s been here over a decade: it weren&#39;t never gonna happen.<br><br>Anyway, scruples is also why no one would take over Despatch-type missions. Anything to do with real people is no longer in the PPC&#39;s jurisdiction, period.<br><br>And before anyone goes &quot;what about historical figures that appear in fiction?&quot;, yes, that&#39;s usually different.

            <p>...Every Boarder Ever except my fellow ne&#39;er-do-wells Snowblaze and 61516 avoided the Despatch question post, I&#39;d just like to say that that post was an author spork request.

Because the fic didn&#39;t involve Trans-Dimensional Hopping <i>or</i> Snatching, because canon characters weren&#39;t directly involved at all. Actually, it was about four OCs who were... reincarnations, I guess, it never really says, of four prominent villains from prominent continua. And had powers associated with them. And even though I as the author knew who the self-insert was (Kylie, the one who&#39;s the Emperor from Star Wars), there wasn&#39;t really that much self-insertion involved. Overall, it seems to be a would-be Despatch target of its own breed. Ignoring the question of whether it&#39;s sporkable, because apparently it&#39;s not as bad as it could&#39;ve been, what would that have done to it?<br><br>-Twistey</p>

            <p>It&#39;s not exactly a crossover, since no other canon is really involved, either.

            <p>I thought I&#39;d said here; apparently not though.<br><br>I&#39;m pretty excited too, to be honest. I actually think Young Aragorn is one of the less interesting options, even with just Hobbit+LotR+Appendices to work from; he&#39;s tightly constrained by the fact that, canonically, people aren&#39;t supposed to know who he is.<br><br>He also presses Amazon up against a very specific problem: there&#39;s no climactic battle. More specifically, there&#39;s precisely <i>one</i>: the victory over the Corsairs of Umbar. All Aragorn&#39;s other endpoints are &#39;welp, done with this country now, on to another one&#39;. There&#39;s no big victory, for the very obvious reason that that has to wait for the War of the Ring.<br><br>Which, if they&#39;re actually doing only <i>one</i> season of Estel/Thorongil, works out quite nicely. You start with him in the wilds, with Legolas (per B5A) meeting him. You show him meeting Arwen, and build on the Movie notion of him only being able to marry her if he becomes king. So he travels to Rohan and then Gondor as a sort of training, and winds up sailing from Dol Amroth to defeat the Corsairs. A nice, flowing storyline - but one which doesn&#39;t work at all if they try and cut it into multiple seasons.<br><br>So... if it <i>is</i> only one, what are the following seasons? Cribbing from something I wrote elsewhere, I think it&#39;s likely that the other seasons will follow the first, chronologically, which means... well, what are the options?<br><br>-Adventures of the Old Took. Obviously a bit out of its timeline, but viable, and a hilarious notion.<br>-Adventures of Tom Bombadil. ^_^<br>-Adventures of Balin in Moria. A bit of a downer.<br>-Adventures of Not-So-Young Legolas (And Tauriel). Time to reuse those Hobbit movie sets!<br>-Adventures of Evil Saruman. C&#39;mon, we could definitely have a season of Saruman&#39;s fall into darkness. (Again, serious timeline issues, but this is Movie-earth.)<br>-Adventures of Young Imrahil. If Young Aragorn doesn&#39;t cover the Corsairs, then this Dol Amroth-centric series will.<br>-Adventures of Young(??) Galadriel. Who wants to stay in the woods when you can go be shiny at people?<br>-Adventures of Young Theoden. Horses! ... more horses!<br>-Adventures of Young Talion [Shadow of Mordor games]. Because what we really need is Mordor the Green and Pleasant Land, right? ... right?!<br>-Adventures of The War In The North. I suppose we should pay lip service to the whole plot of the books, yeah? In which case...<br>-Adventures in Scouring the Shire. Hey, PJ left it out, so we get to put it in.<br><br>And, finally...<br><br>-Adventures in Gardening. Just a whole season of Master Samwise peacefully tending his garden, looking after his kids, and being the best dang mayor the Shire has ever had.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>You may have said so here, too; it&#39;s possible it was a time I wasn&#39;t paying much attention, or I just forgot. All the brainspace I have to give Real Life these days is severely restricting my ability to keep track of everything else. The other day I had to <i>look up</i> who actually owned Narsil before it broke, Elendil or Isildur. {= (<br><br>Clearly I shall have to reread the Appendices in order to properly engage with this topic, but for now...<br><br>I think the secrecy around who Aragorn really is could add a nice bit of drama to the whole story if they do it right. He&#39;s in hiding for a reason, so the necessity of keeping on the down-low could make for some good peril if any servants of the Enemy are lurking about. I don&#39;t think it will be possible to keep it a total secret from the audience, but they could restrict themselves to merely hinting at why he&#39;s important, with the full reveal only coming at the end. If they&#39;re subtle about it, it&#39;ll be fun for those already in the know and nicely surprising for those who aren&#39;t. (Because you know some people will be coming to Middle-earth for the first time through this series. Every <s>Comic</s> Adaptation Is Someone&#39;s First.)<br><br>Also, there&#39;s potential in getting to know the other Rangers, such as Halbarad and the El twins, who got screwed out of their role in the movies.<br><br>I sorta want to focus on what he was doing in Rohan, though? I don&#39;t know exactly what that was, but he was running around with King Thengel and Young Theoden, right? Do we know there <i>wasn&#39;t</i> a big battle (if we actually need one)?<br><br>Look, I like horses. I am totally cool with Horses! and More horses! ^_^<br><br>I would also like a story about Merry and Pippin and Sam being awesome after the war, back home in the Shire. There&#39;s got to be some interesting political dramedy we can wring out of the Shire integrating into the Kingdom of Arnor under the leadership of the comic relief characters, right?<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>-Born 2931.<br>-Father dies 2933. Fostered in Rivendell as Estel. Journeys with the El-twins.<br>-2941: Quest of Erebor (book).<br>-2952 (age 21): learns true name, receives Narsil. Meets Arwen for the first time and falls in love with her. Heads into the Wild.<br>-2953 (age 22): Misses the last meeting of the White Council.<br>-2956 (age 25): meets Gandalf, visits the Shire, becomes known as Strider.<br>-2957 (age 26): begins journeying as Thorongil, heading to Rohan. Theoden is 11. Thengel has held the throne for four years. Saruman begins fortifying Isengard in this timeframe. Theodwyn, mother of Eomer and Eowyn, will be born in 2963.<br>-2958: Quest of Erebor, assuming the timeline is shunted forward 17 years by losing them in FotR-M. This matches up with B5A-M, where he&#39;s already known as Strider (per Gandalf).<br>-ca. 2970 (age 39): moves on from Rohan to Gondor, eventually working his way up to Ecthelion&#39;s most trusted counsellor. Denethor is 40 - yes, they&#39;re only a year apart! - and in 2976 will marry Finduilas, who will be 26. Boromir will be born in 2978.<br>-2979? (age 48): attacks Umbar and destroys its fleet. Refuses to return to Minas Tirith, but journeys on into South Gondor and heads for the Mountains of Shadow. Spends a while learning about Sauron&#39;s plans, then heads back towards Rivendell and enters Lorien around New Year, (ie, ca. April 1st).<br>-2980 (age 49): Aragorn and Arwen wander Lorien together for a season, and plight their troth at midsummer.<br>-3001 (age 70): Begins the Hunt for Gollum.<br><br>So there&#39;s possibilities there! You start with his 21st birthday (March 1st, 2952), when Elrond tells him his name and gives him his sword and ring. Then he meets Arwen, falls head-over-heels in love, and goes out into the wild when she doesn&#39;t return his affections.<br><br>You get a couple of episodes of Ranging, then have an adventure with Gandalf in the Shire. Gandalf prompts him to go south, noting that perhaps Elrond will look favourably on such a move, and we head off to Rohan.<br><br>Rohan and Gondor are both going to mingle politics with war, so we need to find a way to distinguish them. Remembering that Pippin contrasts kindly Theoden with harsh Denethor, we can treat Rohan in a &#39;family I never had&#39; way, with Aragorn acting like an older cousin to Theoden and baby Theodwyn. They face incursions of goblins and Huorns from the north (which gives Aragorn a chance to hear tales of the Witch of the Golden Wood), and negotiate with Saruman.<br><br>Then on to Gondor, where Aragorn meets a very different reception. Ecthelion is wary of him; Denethor is actively hostile. He winds up in exile in Dol Amroth (where Angelimir rules, Adrahil has 15 years on Aragorn, and Imrahil is a teenager). We can probably tie his return to Finduilas&#39; trip to marry Denethor - perhaps Aragorn thwarts an attack by the corsairs, earning him his place back in Minas Tirith?<br><br>So Aragorn grows closer to the Steward, though not to his son. For dramatic reasons, we&#39;re going to put his explorations of the South and East in here, having him vanishing and reappearing at odd times. That means the third-to-last episode can be &#39;gasp, a fleet from Umbar, but where is Thorongil?&#39;, the penultimate episode is &#39;haha, Thorongil smashes the corsairs&#39;, and the final episode can be his journey to Lorien and his reunion with Arwen, a sort of farewell tour of the first season, wrapping up the personal themes.<br><br>It does have possibilities, to be sure.<br><br>hS</p>

Is this just another iteration of the Hobbit+LotR license that New Line have been using? Or have Amazon managed to get the remaining directors (including apparently JRRT&#39;s daughter Priscilla, and grandson Michael George) to release some of the Silm/Unfinished Tales material? Christopher has always been dead against that, but it&#39;s possible his resignation was a way for him to gracefully allow it without directly compromising.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>See, I like the story of <i>Lord of the Rings</i>, and I own both the book and the films - but I am far more likely to watch the films than I am read the book. <br><br>Part of that may just be the particular edition of the book I own: a hardback of the full trilogy in one, so it&#39;s roughly the size, shape and weight of a breeze block, and I&#39;ve always done a lot of reading while travelling - not exactly practical with this book. But another part is just the writing style is pretty heavy going,and sometimes feels like it takes actual physical effort to read through. The films are just a lot more easily accessible, and I find them entertaining enough. <br><br>But I am aware that the books came first, and that the films cu a lot of stuff out, and made a lot of changes. <br><br>I think I was lucky with the films in that I liked the story, but hadn&#39;t read the book for ages, so I just didn&#39;t pick up on the changes (which sadly wasn&#39;t the case for the recent <i>Mortal Engines</i>). <br><br>-Irish</p>

I can see a partial recasting going very sideways - &#39;why does Arwen look different when Gandalf looks the same?!&#39; - but also if they do things that would break the plot of the films.<br><br>The funniest thing will be if they do something book-accurate which disagrees with Jackson. How about black walls around Minas Tirith? Or accurate distances between various points?<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Don&#39;t start working to achieve it until we&#39;ve gotten to know you sufficiently. That makes sure that we don&#39;t give someone Permission who then turns around and wrecks the PPC universe.<br><br>In the meantime, sit back and relax! Here are a few things you can do on the Board that don&#39;t require Permission:<br><br>- Post about things you love (that&#39;s called a plug).<br>- Post about things you wrote and are proud of (that&#39;s called a self-plug).<br>- Participate in everyone else&#39;s posts!<br>- Start a random RP. Snowball fights are a popular favorite, but be forewarned that I have a flamethrower. }:)<br>- Participate in various annual Board events, such as the Badfic Games, Plort, and the Shipfest. Those&#39;ll come when they come.<br><br>Anyway, hi!

            <p>I found myself very interested in the backstory of the main character, especially his relationship with the new Queen. The style is very... well, I only know the word in Hungarian, it means something like &#39;easy-sounding&#39;. What I&#39;m trying to say is, you have a very natural-sounding writing style. (Artificial or awkward phrasing is one of my pet peeves, and something I try hard to avoid.) I like the end best, though - it made me smile. :)</p>

            <p>It was Saturday evening, and the Moon family were gathered around the drawing room table, playing the imaginatively-named Bid Fours, in which players were dealt some cards and then bid for more, aiming to collect fours of a kind. It was traditionally played with suits representing different gemstones.<br><br>Holly turned over the next card, the Seven of Sapphires, and said “I bid one,” taking one of her small round tokens and placing it into the pool.<br><br>Tiger was next. He glanced at his hand: he had the Seven of Rubies, but he knew his father had the Sevens of Emeralds and Diamonds. “I bid two,” he said, glancing at his pile of tokens. There were about thirty of them left. He picked up two tokens and added them to the pool.<br><br>“I bid three,” said Francis smoothly. He moved his own tokens into the pool. <br><br>Holly, having no Sevens, passed. Tiger bid four and he and his father went back and forth until Francis bid seventeen.<br><br>Tiger raised his eyebrows. Surely Francis knew that Tiger had the Seven of Rubies? Why would his father bid so highly for what could only be a third seven? He tried to remember how many tokens his father had left: it couldn’t be many more than he himself had.<br><br>“Pass,” he said. No matter how strange his father’s tactics, he couldn’t afford to spend any more tokens.<br><br>Francis picked up the Seven of Sapphires and lay beside it his Sevens of Diamonds and Emeralds, and – Tiger could hardly believe his eyes – the Seven of Rubies.<br><br>“What – “ spluttered Tiger. “How – “ He pulled the Seven of Rubies from his own hand and laid it face up on the table to prove the evident impossibility of what had just happened.<br><br>Francis ignored him and casually counted out twenty tokens from the pool as his reward for four of a kind. <br><br>“What does that have to do with anything?” Holly asked.<br><br>“That’s the Seven of – “ Tiger broke off suddenly as he looked down at the perfectly drawn rubies on the card. There were six of them. “What? I swear when I put that down it was the Seven, not the Six.”<br><br>“Of course it was,” said Francis. “This is a Paradox Pack. Cards can be duplicated as long as they are not seen by all players together, in which case one card will morph into a similar card.”<br><br>“And you didn’t bother telling us that? I would have bid higher if I had known!”<br><br>“I was wondering if you’d work it out.” <br><br>Tiger rolled his eyes. <br><br>Francis turned over the next card, the Three of Diamonds, and said “I bid one.”<br></p>

            <p>I think you&#39;ve done a good job on the atmosphere, but the structure seems to have been developing as you wrote. The last 3 verse pairs have the same form: her lines start and end with a &#39;Father&#39; invocation, while his all start with &#39;daughter&#39;. You haven&#39;t quite stuck to that in the first two verse-pairs, and I think it would make it stronger if you did.<br><br>I&#39;m also unclear whether there&#39;s supposed to be any rhythm in there. The accented &#39;condemnéd&#39; suggests there is - ie, that you needed an extra syllable in that line to make it fit - but I can&#39;t find one by reading it.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>The structure of the poem is pretty experimental. The accent in &#39;condemned&#39; was more a rhyme thing, but it probably sounds different in my reading than yours (I learned English from the internet, so my pronunciation is a cobbled-together version of about a dozen different accents). You&#39;re right though, some rewriting is definitely needed. I was more worried about the atmosphere, so I&#39;m glad I got that one right ^_^</p>

I was hoping that it would help the flow of the poem if there were some rhymes in it, but it&#39;s kind of half-assed if I&#39;m not doing a proper rhyme scheme. I&#39;ll rewrite it as soon as I grt the chance.</p>

            <p>I didn&#39;t change that much though, just incorporated the father/daughter structure into the first two verses, and scrapped the not-really rhyme scheme. I think it looks a little better now.</p>

            <p>The invocation/response structure really makes it sound like she&#39;s almost praying to him (probably helped by the fact that in some churches, &#39;Father&#39; or &#39;Heavenly Father&#39; is used in actual prayers). The repeat of &#39;father&#39; at the end of the verse also evokes a young child - they quite often repeat the name/title of whoever they&#39;re addressing if they&#39;re anxious.<br><br>And in specific imagery, I love the lantern eyes, which seem to go from an abstract metaphor (&#39;the lantern-eyed giant in the mist&#39;) to a concrete reality (&#39;I will break his lantern eyes&#39;).<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>... is how much structure a poem needs to be, y&#39;know, a poem.<br><br>At one end, you have the Shakespearean, totally formalised version, with so many beats to a line, a precise and unbreakable rhyme scheme, a set number of lines, the whole deal.<br><br>At the other end, you have that weird little plums poem that routinely does the rounds on social media, which is just two sentences broken up weirdly. But it&#39;s still a poem, I guess?<br><br>The key, to my mind, is intent:<br><br><i>The stair creaked<br>The door squeaked<br>Soft swished the sea on the shore</i><br><br>I&#39;ve mixed rhyme and alliteration with wild abandon here, but that&#39;s because they&#39;re doing different things: the rhyme tells you that the stair and door should be considered together, while the sea line is designed to evoke the sound of waves, and to take you to a slightly different location. I needn&#39;t have a rhyme across the entire thing, nor make the whole poem alliterate - but I probably would need to use those things to mark similar moments when they occurred.<br><br>Which goes back to your father/daughter language. It&#39;s good structure, and with a little refining, it could run through the entire story. I have a poem bobbing around somewhere that ends each verse with a variation on &#39;the snow falls [white/deep/cold]&#39;, solely so that I could add an <i>extra</i> line after it at the end, &#39;but I am warm&#39;.<br><br>hS</p>
