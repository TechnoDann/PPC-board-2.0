            <p>Recently in deviantart I ended up in a bit of a debate with another artist over how I was doing an OC character as well as how I was doing a certain game.<br>Then, following a recent comment, I made the mistake of posting my issues of the local forum without consulting the rules.<br><br>I&#39;ll admit that was pretty stupid of me... I ended up causing drama.<br><br>I had to give this a great deal of thought after reading the following replies. Then I came to the conclusion that I&#39;m not good at writing LGBT OCs.<br><br>So I decided that on April 2, I&#39;ll be taking down all my fanfic on both deviantart and FF.net and do a complete overhaul. As of tomorrow all my LGTH OCs will be straight.<br><br>I know what I&#39;m doing will be seen as completely stupid but I just wanted to clean my slate and start over again.</p>

            <p>As I am informed by LGBTQ+ people in my circles, the main take-away message about writing gay people (or people of any minority) is that they are <i>people</i> first. We all have the same basic psychological needs. Identity and life experience, and how they interact, in all their infinite variety, color how we go about fulfilling those needs. It&#39;s important to be aware of the stereotypes and the history that created them in order to avoid perpetuating harmful ideas, but basically, as long as you&#39;re treating all your characters as complex human beings, regardless of sexuality or whatever else, you&#39;re probably fine.<br><br>Like the article says, take the feedback on board and give it serious and respectful consideration, but you can&#39;t please everyone all the time. Don&#39;t let it scare you away from trying to do something good with your writing.<br><br>~Neshomeh, demi/straight woman who sometimes writes gay men and is still working hard to wrap her head around the idea of attraction to women.</p>

            <p>We&#39;re not exactly heavy on the pitchforks around here. And seeing as I don&#39;t know what&#39;s up, I don&#39;t know how to help too much.<br><br>Speaking for myself, I think most of that advice is pretty sound, honestly. Although I have a bit of my own.<br><br>1) Accept that you cannot please everyone: there are a lot of different opinions about how to write LGBT characters. Especially from LGBT people. You won&#39;t make all of them happy and it frankly shouldn&#39;t be your goal to, because the inherently conflicting nature of all the different opinions means that you&#39;ll wind up with a character with no personality. Some LGBT people believe that straight people shouldn&#39;t write gay characters, or shouldn&#39;t write about certain aspects of their experience, like coming or what ever. Do your research, try and get the tricky stuff right, but don&#39;t listen to those people and subsequently avoid writing key scenes in the life of your characters because strangers on the internet said you shouldn&#39;t write them.<br><br>2) Personality: different people approach things differently. Personality, not sexuality, is the primary discriminator here. If you know that a character is gay or lesbian or bisexual or trans, look at who they are and how they got to where they are. That&#39;s going to inform a lot about how they act. It will also do a lot to tell you how they handle their own sexuality: not everyone is flamboyant and all out there. Some of us (*cough cough* me *cough cough*) would rather go sit imn a corner and read or whatever.<br><br>...Honestly, the article pretty much covered all that. Huh.</p>

            <p>I can only say a three words:<br><br>IT IS AWESOME!!!<br><br>The Orville is a ongoing science fiction dramedy series from the critically acclaimed creator/co-creator of Family Guy and American Dad Seth Macfarlane. It&#39;s a homage to the legendary sci-fi programme Star Trek, specifically Trek before it became <strike>Sexually Transmitted Disease</strike> <strike>Star Turd: Dumbfrakery</strike> Star Trek: Discovery. I.e. terrible. The Orville is published by Fox Television Studios (now a subsidiary of the Walt Disney Corporation), and streams in Australia for free on SBS On Demand and airs on free-to-air on SBS Viceland. <br><br>It is the 25th century, and humanity is now a founding member of the Planetary Union, a alliance of a multitude of alien species. Ed Mercer (played by Seth Macfarlane himself) is a captain in the Union Fleet, and is rising through the ranks rapidly. That is, until he comes home from work one day to find his wife, Commander Kelly Grayson (played by Andianne Palacki (sp?)), banging a blue-skinned alien called Darulio in his bed. <br><br>One year later, Ed&#39;s career is in shambles. The affair and subsequent divorce has put him at the bottom of the list for promotion, and has resulted in him drinking his career away. He is given a second chance when he is given command of the USS Orville, a mid-level exploratory vessel that needs a new captain after the last one retired. Ed accepts, and enlists his best friend, Lt. Gordon Malloy (played by Scott Grimes) as the ship&#39;s helmsman. <br><br>His initial crew consists of CMO Dr. Claire Finn (played by ST:DS9 alumni Penny Johnson Jerald); Science officer Issac, a member of the elusive robotic-species, the Kaylon (played by Mark Jackson); 2nd Officer Bortus, a member of the all-male Moclans (played by Peter Macon); the young security chief Alara Kitan, a member of the high-gravity-dwelling Seleyans (played by Halston Sage); navigator John LeMarr (played by J. Lee)...and his Ex-wife as his first officer. Yes. This goes as well as it sounds, at least initially. <br><br>Mid-season, Lamarr gets promoted to Chief Engineer, simular to how Geordi LaForge on TNG started out as the helmsman, and then switched over to the engineering officer. During the second season, Alara leaves, and is replaced with Jessica Szohr as Talla Keyali as the new security chief. <br><br>More to come soon. </p>

            <p>Went for one of the less popular William Shakespeare plays this time.  Sir John Falstaff had a minor appearance in the last <i>Thursday Next</i> novel I read, and the back cover blurb for the next one indicates that <i>Merry Wives</i> itself will be important to the plot.  I’m debating whether I want to read through all the <i>Henry</i> plays as well before I continue with <i>Thursday Next</i>; I’ll admit I’m not too interested in the purely historical plays.  I like my Shakespeare with a little fantasy.<br><br>Spoiler warning for <i>The Merry Wives of Windsor</i>.<br><br>It took me quite a while to really get into this play, partly because I had difficulty keeping track of the characters early on.  This is probably my fault for, as I mentioned above, not reading the <i>Henry</i> plays first.  (Also, my work schedule means I can typically only get reading done in fifteen-minute chunks separated by hours of work time during most of the week.)  Either way, I did get into the play and its characters as time went on.  I mean, its primary action is about a straight dude getting dumped on by everyone around him for being a horndog, so as an asexual person, it was hard not for me to be amused.  I was cheering on the “merry wives” the whole time!<br><br>I was surprised at how modern this play felt to me.  A lot of the humor—pratfalls, veiled pun-based insults, intentional and unintentional innuendo—are still hallmarks of modern humor, especially in film.  In particular, the scene where Mistress Quickly keeps misinterpreting Sir Hugh’s innocent Latin as vulgar English, and the boy learning English is clearly more aware of the dual meanings than the grown Sir Hugh, felt like something out of a modern comedy.<br><br>It’s also interesting that the play, written so many centuries ago, very clearly puts female roles in the lead, while showing most of the main male roles to have character failings.  We’re still struggling with presenting good female characters in fiction today, yet here’s Shakespeare back around 1600, making them the leads of a play, and the undeniable moral superiors of the story.  The one thing Mistress Page is shown to get wrong is her plans for marrying her daughter off to Doctor Caius, but even then, it’s Anne Page’s desire to marry for love that’s cast as the correct decision; again, the smart decision comes from a woman.  I also like that Fenton serves as a contrast to Falstaff by initially courting Anne for the same financial reasons as Falstaff was targeting Anne’s mother, but then got to know Anne and fell in true love.<br><br>—doctorlit, rooting for Anne to get paired with no one . . . but he guesses that’s just not in the cards, in this time period . . .<br><br>“Spoiler?  I would I could wash myself of the spoiler.  Spoiler, spoiler, spoiler!  Ay, spoiler!  I warrant you, spoiler, and of the season too, it shall appear.”</p>

            <p>My brother tried to convince me not to watch this series, because he said it was too boring.  I’m learning to ignore his word when he says he doesn’t like something, because he’s way more critical of fiction than I am.  Sometimes, you just have a to let a story unfold over you, know what I mean?<br><br>Spoilers for <i>Iron Fist</i> season one.  (And there are some major twist reveals about character allegiance this season, so if you’re planning to watch, please don’t read this.)<br><br>Like I said in my <i>Luke Cage</i> season one review, I was put off a bit by how dark the <i>Daredevil</i> and <i>Jessica Jones</i> series have been up to this point.  While <i>Iron Fist</i> wasn’t quite as light in tone as <i>Luke Cage</i>, it was definitely more enjoyable than the other two.  <i>Cage</i> is still my favorite, though.<br><br>I was side-eyeing this going in, because it’s essentially got a white character taking on aspects of Asian culture and martial arts, and I wasn’t sure how well it would be handled.  I think it did quite well, with the actor who played Danny Rand finding a good balance between reverence for his monastery training, and a bit of childishness at seeing aspects of his old New York life for the first time since age ten.  I also liked that the show addressed the failings of K’un-Lun’s training in teaching Danny to ignore his own feelings, preventing him from healing emotionally through the kind of psychiatric treatment he would have received growing up in the States.  By the end of the season, Danny really feels like a balance between the eastern and western aspects of his life, not bound too tightly to the rules of K’un-Lun, but not entirely given over to the anger and regret he felt from losing his parents.<br><br>Up until this point, I thought that Madame Gao was a Celestial, or another similar being, who got tied up with Wilson Fisk’s criminal enterprises partly out of an ignorance of human culture and biology.  Even on the occasions when Daredevil encountered her, she always seemed so calm and aloof, and non-threatening (except when Daredevil tried to grab her), that I rather liked her as a character.  This means that I was actually disappointed to learn in this series that she was a member of the Hand.  Even though it gave her more screen time to be cool in, it also means she’s a much more dangerous threat than I realized, and considering the fact that she seems to be immortal, her character will inevitably need to be killed off eventually.  I am both anticipating that, to see an end of the damage she causes to innocent people, and sad about it, because her voice is cool.<br><br>The sheer number of villain factions in this season was a little overwhelming, and it doesn’t help that when we are first introduced to them, we don’t know the real moral standings of the Meachums, Davos, or Bakuto, and that’s saying nothing of the fact that Colleen Wing was secretly Hand all along.  (Small side note: I’m terrible at guessing plot reveals before they arrive, partly because I don’t try to, because I love the little feeling of thrill when something unexpected happens in a story I’ve invested in.  But I actually guessed Colleen’s real allegiance many episodes in advance, although my one friend who’s also into the MCU managed to convince me I was wrong at the time, for which I am grateful.  But I still wish I had been wrong.)  By the end of the season, once everyone’s standing was a little more firmly established, it was kind of fun having so many villains going after each other, since it lead to scenes where, no matter who won/died, it was a win for the “good side.”  But it also left me feeling like the actual protagonists were often floundering to make any real progress, especially considering how long Danny was manipulated by Harold Meachum.<br><br>Putting aside my love of hearing Madame Gao speak, I thought all three actors playing the Meachum family were particularly excellent.  Joy Meachum seems so kind and sympathetic whenever she’s alone with Danny or Ward, but her actor turns her into an absolute shark in the board room scenes.  Ward’s actor was so good at wearing that mask of straight-laced and uncaring disdain, for so many episodes, it makes it even more disarming when he starts to crack under the pressure later in the season as he comes to realize how dangerous Harold 2.0 and 3.0 are.  And Harold’s actor is so good at sounding both sincere and manipulative in a single sentence, I think the only time we’re presented with Harold’s honest self is when he’s in a rage, or right after his second resurrection, when he’s wandering around deliriously piecing his memories back together—and how telling that even in that state of mind, he sees the Rand Enterprises logo, and asks, “Why isn’t it my name?”  His ambition, and fury over not getting what he wants, are his defining traits, always hidden under telling others what they want to hear to get them to do what he really wants.  It’s also interesting (and kind of sad) that Joy and Ward swap relationships with Danny by the end of the season, with Ward going from having Danny committed to a mental hospital at the start of the season to saving his life at the end, while Joy goes from helping Danny get a foot back in the door of their company at the start to plotting with two other villains to have him killed in the final scene.<br><br>—doctorlit is ticked off that he’s eventually going to have to start going after the MCU stuff that’s on networks he isn’t already paying for<br><br>“You took a vow of spoilers?  “You took a vow of spoilers?”  “You took a vow of spoilers?”  “You took a vow of spoilers?”</p>

            <p><b>Content warning: mention of infanticide</b><br><br>I have a serious issue with your description of the first one, specifically the &quot;offensive username&quot;. <br><br>&quot;Autistic&quot; is not a bad word. It is not derogatory, it is not an insult, it is not offensive. Are there people who use it as such? Yes, but #!$@ them.<br><br>Is it that they might be self-identifying as autistic, and are unafraid to claim that label? If you call &quot;self-identifying as autistic&quot; offensive, that&#39;s really, really not okay. <br><br>Is it that they might be headcanoning Duo-the-character (possibly Duo Maxwell, possibly someone else, that&#39;s really not the point) as autistic? That, too, is not offensive, and it&#39;s really not okay to say otherwise, especially if the person originating the headcanon is autistic themself. <br><br>Do you have to agree with their headcanon? No. Is it hurting anyone or anything? No. Is it possible that an autistic person might have a much more nuanced understanding of what autism actually is, and how it looks, than an allistic (non-autistic) person? Very much so. Has a creator explicitly said that some character is allistic? Death of the Author, baby.<br><br>*sighs* Look. As you may be able to tell, this is a major hot-button for me. Hi. I&#39;m autistic, and I find the characterization of &quot;TheAutisticDuo&quot; as an offensive username to itself be incredibly offensive. I don&#39;t fit the expected societal norms for an autistic person, because standard autistic stereotypes really, really aren&#39;t one-size-fits-all. There&#39;s also a lot of institutionalized sexism in autism diagnosis, which I won&#39;t get into in this post, but am happy to talk about if anyone&#39;s curious.<br><br>Organizations like Autism $peaks (which is spelled with an S, not a $, but I point-blank refuse to let the Board auto-harvest that for advertising links) are also incredibly damaging to the autistic community. I honestly wouldn&#39;t be surprised if this is where the &quot;offensive&quot; description ultimately originates from. They have no autistic people involved anywhere in their organization, and are primarily composed of Autism Parents TM (which is not the same as parents of autistic folks, to be clear). <br><br>Far more damning, though, is that they do stuff like <i><b>supporting parents who murder their autistic children</b></i>. Unfortunately, they&#39;re also the main and only &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;autistic voice&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot; most people are aware of. They also promote therapies like ABA, which is focused not on helping autistic folks, but rather on forcing them to pretend like they&#39;re allistic, in incredibly damaging ways. There&#39;s something like an <b><i>80% PTSD rate</i></b> among ABA survivors. (I don&#39;t have sources immediately to hand, but if anyone is interested, I can dig some up. I can also go into so much more detail about <i>Them</i>, but I won&#39;t unless someone explicitly wants me to.)<br><br>To be clear, now that I&#39;m past the initial &quot;you said <i>what</i>&quot; rage, I&#39;m not actually angry at you. I&#39;m angry at and about the rampant societal ableism and stigma surrounding autism and autistic people; I&#39;m furious at organizations like Autism $peaks, who essentially consider my life less valuable for being autistic; and I&#39;m heartbroken by the harm and discrimination my community faces every day.<br><br>April is Autism Awareness Month. This year, don&#39;t &quot;light it up blue&quot; with Autism $peaks; listen to the #ActuallyAutistic community, and go #RedInstead.<br><br>... This, I suppose, has been your Autism Awareness Month lesson. It&#39;s something I think is really important to put out there, but I&#39;m sorry I&#39;ve ended up shoving it down your throat.<br><br>~Fire Sidoni</p>

            <p>To elaborate on things a bit:<br><br>I&#39;ve been diagnosed with either Aspergers syndrome or high-functioning autism (depending on the diagnosing doctor, although the two conditions are simular enough to be pretty indistinguishable) since I was in my early years of high school. This author, however, does not seem to be autistic in any way shape or form. They consistently make reference to &quot;bumfricking&quot; on their profile, and they claim to be two seperate people, hence the &quot;duo&quot; bit (not sure what canon you were referring to there). I&#39;ve messaged them before via FF.net  asking if they&#39;d like me to beta for them (under the initial assumption they were not a troll), and they called me- among other things- a &quot;chink&quot;, which really shows you should never tell people your ethnicity in a beta-offer. <br><br>They simply appear to be using autism as a shield for trolling behaviour, something I disapprove of immensely. They also copy elements of badfics like My Immortal in their stories, for example the story I posted starts remarkably like said legendary badfic. This all points to a troll. While they may or may not be autistic, they still act in a way that puts a bad rep on other autistic individuals like myself. While I understand your outrage, I don&#39;t think you should be aiming it at me. </p>

            <p>I’m sorry to jump down your throat like that, then - that’s very relevant information, especially that they appear to be using it as a trolling shield, and it does cast things in a whole different light. My sincere apologies! This does indeed seem to have been misaimed. <br><br>(Incidentally, you may already know this, but the most recent version of the DSM and (IIRC) either the most recent or the upcoming version of the ICD have merged the diagnoses of autism and Asperger’s, so now it’s all just autism spectrum disorder.)</p>

            <p>Is it just me, or does the narration forget the characters aren&#39;t human during the sex scenes? The anatomy and the blocking are mind-boggling.<br><br>Also, has anyone ever come across a reader-insert fic that actually works? Like, call me crazy, but I&#39;m pretty sure I can put myself in the shoes of a character that has their own distinct but well-realized personality more easily than I can a character like this, whose only motivation seems to be freaky alien sex and who barely gets one coherent sentence of dialogue per chapter. I started thinking of &quot;You&quot; as the character&#39;s name, because it makes more sense that way, and You is about as interesting and sympathetic as wet cardboard.<br><br>I kinda feel bad for the literal Andalite bandits in this story. They exist for half a chapter and even get cute little bits of backstory, and then they&#39;re gone, unlamented, never to be heard from again (at least as far as chapter 4). They sound way more interesting than You. Can we get a story about them, and how Visser Three thought he&#39;d finally triumphed over his enemies when he caught them, only to realize they&#39;re a bunch of pathetic cast-offs instead, and then they end up escaping and ruining his day anyway, because they&#39;re a Rag-Tag Band of Misfits and Wacky Hijinks Ensue?

            <p>I got it for Christmas and read it in a couple of days. For a book that starts with a meteor strike taking out Washington DC and most of the Eastern Seaboard, and deals intimately with all manner of prejudice (it is the 1950s, after all), it&#39;s surprisingly... <i>wholesome</i>, is the best word I can come up with. It would be very easy for that premise to go all DARKNESS -- NO PARENTS, but Kowal resists the temptation. That doesn&#39;t mean she doesn&#39;t do justice to the fact that &#39;50s America was super prejudiced in so many ways - but she does it in a way that doesn&#39;t make me hate every single character in there.<br><br>I think part of the reason is that she doesn&#39;t take the route of &#39;it&#39;s Institutional, so we can&#39;t change it&#39;, but rather treats institutional prejudice as something that <i>can</i> be changed, and by <i>individuals</i>. Yes, it takes work - a lot of work, a lot of pain - but it <b>can</b> be done.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Hi Boarders! I’m Crazy Minh, a Fanfiction author and riffer of badfics. I’ve got some experience dissecting travesties of fanfiction over at Library of the Damned, where I’m a guest riffer. I believe Herr used to frequent these parts of the internet? Herr Wozzak? Anyone?<br><br>*potential cricket noise*<br><br>Eh, not important. Anyway, with some experience riffing fanfics under my belt, I thought I’d try my hand at PPC’ing some fanfics. Before anyone asks, I’ve read the FAQ, the Constitution, the Permission Guidelines, and the Original Series (well, most of it. Haven’t quite found the time to finish reading episodes 17 onwards, but I’ll get round to it) <br><br>A little about myself: I’m a avid Sci-Fi geek, and my everday vernacular is often littered with exclamations of Peta’Q, Gorram, Frak, Zark, and other such phrases. I’m a massive Trekkie, specifically TNG and DS9, though I absolutely DESPISE STD. I mean, this is mouth-frothing, eye-popping hatred we’re talking. That insufferable Sue Burnham can die in a fire for all I care. Where was I?<br><br>Ah yes, about me. I’m hyperlexic, and have forgotten more books in my 28 years on this ball of rock than most will ever read in a lifetime. I’ a big fan of Asimov, Heinlein and Clarke, and have read I, Robot so many times that I can recite it word-for-word. I’m not as big of a fan of fantasy, but I have read Tolkien’s works, and I have been a fan of Harry Potter since the day it was released. <br><br>I’m alsoa avid tabletop gamer, having played Warhammer 40k to death (to’tau’va folks!), and currently play D&amp;D every Wednesday evening with my gaming group. I’ve also been known to play Cyberpunk, Shadowrun &amp; MTG on occassion. <br><br>Well, that’s anout it for intros. Catch you in the funny pages, folks!<br></p>

            <p>So, I&#39;m planning a trip to Europe to vacation and visit family in early September this year. Because there&#39;s cool people (including a bunch of y&#39;all and my cousin) and cool stuff there, part of the itinerary is London, where I&#39;ll most likely be for a few days surrounding the weekend of September 6-7 (so probably at least the Friday and the Monday, but the exact dates are currently undetermined and subject to adjustment based on people&#39;s schedules). This seems to be like a perfectly good reason to get a bunch of Boarders together for something touristy and nerdy, and so I&#39;m posting to find out who&#39;d be available around then.<br><br>From London, I&#39;ll be headed to Poland, mostly &quot;approximately Wrocław&quot;, so there&#39;s a second Gathering opportunity for folks who can&#39;t make London if needed.<br><br>- Tomash</p>

            <p>For Undertale: Inverted Fate! It&#39;s an AU that actually keeps everyone (mostly; Papyrus doesn&#39;t hate puns THAT much) in character, plus sits tone is very close to that of the game. As for the plot... I don&#39;t want to spoil the canon for you, so if you&#39;ve completed UNDERTALE, then go check it out!<br><a href="https://invertedfate.com"><a href="https://invertedfate.com">https://invertedfate.com</a></a><br><br>For Zi-O: Kamen Rider Zi-O: Another Story. It serves as the Blade/Kiva tribute arc and it&#39;s pretty compelling. Everyone&#39;s in character as far as I can tell, but the format struggles a bit trying to adapt a TV show to a textual medium.<br><a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13242454/1/Kamen-Rider-Zi-O-Another-Story"><a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13242454/1/Kamen-Rider-Zi-O-Another-Story">https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13242454/1/Kamen-Rider-Zi-O-Another-Story</a></a></p>

As of <a href="http://freefall.purrsia.com/ff2500/fc02472.htm">this strip</a>, it&#39;s strongly implied to be canon.<br><br>It&#39;s got the canon&#39;s balance of interesting ethical dilemmas, neat interspecies stuff, and lighthearted moments, and I&#39;d recommend reading it if you liked the comic.</p>

            <p>Granted!<br><br>I recognize your name and I approve of sporking old shames—it&#39;s a good start.<br><br>I like your characters. That&#39;s the main thing that I really have to say, because I found that the most interesting. I think it&#39;ll be cool to see how these two interact, and both of them coming from the same canon should result in some interesting conversations. There&#39;s plenty of potential for conflict between the two of them, but also plenty of potential for them to also become closer over time. <s>and the two don&#39;t need to be mutually exclusive, either.</s> Thumbs up.<br><br>As for the writing: your SPaG looks good, and the ending to the first prompt especially made me laugh out loud.<br><br>And now I&#39;m imagining Chenille as an <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8c/EnglishAngoraRabbit.jpg">Angora rabbit</a> after the brushing scene.
