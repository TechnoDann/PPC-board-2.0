            <p>This probably only is for a very specific group of people, but whatever! One of my favorite artists, a guy going by the moniker of &quot;grandson&quot; has released a new song, called &quot;Apologize.&quot; <br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjILi6KaVuY"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjILi6KaVuY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjILi6KaVuY</a></a><br>Lyrics aren&#39;t NSFW, but they cover some heavy stuff. It&#39;s a little different than his usual intense style, but if you like it, check out his other works. His new, full album will be played on his tour, and released sometime later(?). <br><br>Another thing of note was that the movie Polar came out on Netflix. It&#39;s pretty bloody and violent (and very NSFW), and felt very John Wick-esque, but I enjoyed it. <br>It wasn&#39;t terrible, and was a simple story. But the main reason I mention it is because deadmau5 did most of the soundtrack for the movie, which can be found here: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4hRN5ocMkMzKWnolpT1Rja"><a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4hRN5ocMkMzKWnolpT1Rja">https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4hRN5ocMkMzKWnolpT1Rja</a></a><br>It&#39;s fantastic, imho. I personally enjoy midas heel and the end theme, the most. The songs carry a sort of eerie, but vibing feel. I don&#39;t really have the words to describe music, if it wasn&#39;t obvious.<br><br>Anyhow, hope your month is starting off well, and rabbit rabbit!<br>- Helsinki<br></p>

            <p>Shamus Young, its creator said in introduction to the first comic:<br><br>&quot;Lord of the Rings is more or less the foundation of modern D&amp;D. The latter rose from the former, although the two are now so estranged that to reunite them would be an act of savage madness. Imagine a gaggle of modern hack-n-slash roleplayers who had somehow never been exposed to the original Tolkien mythos, and then imagine taking those players and trying to introduce them to Tolkien via a D&amp;D campaign.&quot;</p>

That&#39;s why knowing how things work is important, so you can extrapolate while not bending any bones or joints in impossible ways. ^_^<br><br>I also like Joumana Medlej&#39;s guides for a simple how-to approach.

            <p>There&#39;s actually a fair bit of nudity in Tolkien. Nienor, of course, but also Saeros (who Turin set to run naked like a beast) and maybe Beren and Finrod (&#39;naked&#39; there might just mean &#39;exposed&#39;). And then over in LotR we have &#39;run naked over the grass&#39; from Bombadil, and naked Frodo in Cirith Ungol... okay, it&#39;s not Game of Thrones, but it&#39;s there.<br><br>What it isn&#39;t, ever, is sexualised. Actually, I&#39;m wrong about him agreeing with you, because it&#39;s not even aesthetic-  it&#39;s always symbolic, either of innocence or vulnerability.<br><br>I don&#39;t think that&#39;s just a stylistic choice, either. There&#39;s a page of sketches by Tolkien of home life at Gypsy Green, including several of Edith (from behind, Tolkien hated faces), and one of then clearly shows her bare to the waist while washing up:<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/zYiwL1B.jpg"><br><br>I dunno... put that together with the fact that when he does talk about sex, Tolkien often tends to the poetic (he literally has a poetic Qenya term for the act), and the fact that this Catholic family only had 4 kids (my dad&#39;s parents had 9), and stopped immediately after the first girl... has the idea of Tolkien being asexual been floated before? Because the argument is there, for sure.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>When Tolkien first constructed his Elvish languages, there were two main ones: Qenya, or Elf-Latin, and Gnomish. Over time, he changed them both significantly, and ultimately renamed them as Quenya and Noldorin, which then became Sindarin.<br><br>I was actually slightly wrong in my recollection: per <a href="http://www.silmarillionwritersguild.org/reference/references/pf/22_words.php">this page</a>, the Qenya &#39;pukta/puhta&#39; and Noldorin &#39;hoith&#39; aren&#39;t strictly poetic. The actual poetic word is &#39;gwî&#39;, which is a term for what I&#39;m sure Tolkien would call the male generative organ. They show up in various lexicons, alongside a <i>host</i> of related terms. <br><br>I&#39;ve seen the source-texts for these words described as &#39;Tolkien&#39;s little black book&#39;, and honestly, it&#39;s hard to argue. If you want to write smut in an Elvish language, get hold of a copy of <i>Parma Eldalamberon 11</i> and use the Gnomish Grammar and Lexicon. Just accept that nobody on the planet is going to understand what you&#39;ve written.<br><br>(Or, y&#39;know, just use <a href="https://folk.uib.no/hnohf/">Ardalambion&#39;s</a> Quenya course and figure out how to adapt the words.)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>(Don&#39;t worry - a few mistakes every now and then are good for Oldbie humility.)<br><br>Thinking about it, it&#39;s appropriate that Gnomish is the language that can write the best smut. Uniquely among the Elven languages, it was viewed as a language of slavery - it was spoken among the people who, at the time of the Great Tales, were almost all thralls in Angband (as referenced in the original Tale of Tinuviel, where Beren was hated by Thingol not as a mortal, but as a probable escaped slave-gnome). So they <i>should</i> have the earthy, blunt language to go with it. Qenya, and later Quenya, were the poetic languages of Valinor, while Noldorin and Sindarin were spoken by free peoples in Beleriand.<br><br>...<br><br>Aaaaand now I&#39;m imagining Gnomish romance novels circulating in the mines, with occasional injections of torture porn written by Orcs to horrify them.<br><br><sub>And then they form a League for the Preservation of Fictional Purity, and start writing poems where they rescue the victims of the Orcs&#39; stories...</sub><br><br>hS, as above, so below</p>

            <p>It&#39;s not generally my thing for publication, but in this case I&#39;m treating it as a puzzle - how much can you do with a severely limited vocabulary and grammar?

            <p>So, a couple of days ago, I found out that K.A. Applegate, author of the <i>Animorphs</i> series, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/gzhau/iam_ka_applegate_author_of_animorphs_and_many/c1rfte1/">has no problem with people pirating her books</a> due to financial reasons or them being not available otherwise. That was pretty great news for me, since the books are out of print, and I neither have a kindle nor the money to spend 4$ per book on a 50+ issue series. I&#39;ve only ever read one of the books I stumbled across in a second-hand bookstore and listened to a couple readings on Youtube.<br><br>So I went searching and found out that you can download the books on <a href="http://animorphsforum.com/ebooks/"> Animorphs Forum</a> both as ePub and as PDF files.<br><br>Also, I&#39;ve decided to read them out in the Discord server. I started yesterday, but had to stop after a couple of chapters to to my voice starting to fail. Anyway, I&#39;m planning to continue tonight, so if anyone wants to join, jump in. I intend to start at around 0:30 CET (which should be 18:30 ET). If you don&#39;t know the books, don&#39;t worry, so far it&#39;s been mostly exposition.<br>~Ak</p>

            <p>You know how sometimes you see something that reminds you of an ex and you’re compelled to go look through their social media and see how they’re doing? Well, recently I saw a post that reminded me of this place, and so here I am. <br>I joined the board in 2011. I was 14. And because I was 14, I lacked the critical thinking skills to realize that what y’all were doing was honestly pretty cruel. So I blindly read all of the stories, practically memorized the wiki, and talked to people on the board. <br>And what did that do for me? It made me afraid to post my own writing, here and everywhere else. I thought that if my stories weren’t perfect, then they were a sin, and that if I posted fic that showed how much of an amateur I was, then people like you would come and make fun of me behind my back. It took me 5 years to get over that fear enough to post any of the fic I wrote. Now, 8 years later, I just received a copy of my fifth professional publication.<br>I’m telling you all this story because it’s not just me. Of the few former PPC members I’ve kept in contact with, all of them agree that what you’re doing here is elitist and mean-spirited. You people have no pity for kids who are just beginning to learn how to write, people who use an unprofessional outlet to practice writing in a way that is fun for them. It’s a real shame too, because some of you are actually very good writers. Just look at the worldbuilding that’s gone into the PPC universe! But then you take those talents and use them to mock those who aren’t as good at writing as you are, and that seems like a waste. No one bursts from the womb writing like Shakespeare. You need to give kids spaces to grow. Eventually they might come to regret what they’ve written, but they don’t need your help to do that.<br>If you’re on this board and you’re still a teen and you’ve gotten this far into my rant, let me tell you this: making mistakes is part of growing up. It’s healthy. People who make fun of kids for making mistakes and being bad at things are mean people who don’t remember what it’s like to be young and vulnerable.<br>And to those in their 20’s and 30’s, particularly those of you whose names I still recognize, all I can think to say is get a life. There are better things to do with your time than make fun of beginning writers and groom young kids into thinking it’s cool to be an elitist. Go write a  book or file your taxes or something.<br>This is the end of my rant. I probably won’t be replying to any responses or checking on this thread after I post it, so don’t expect any answers.<br>All the best,<br>The artist formerly known as TheMadHatteress</p>

            <p>Once I have Permission, I will only spork a fic if the person who&#39;s written it has refused to accept constructive criticism. If I&#39;m not sure, I will do what I can to reach out to them with concrit, and then gauge their response from there. Therefore, I will not be punishing making mistakes, but rather punishing blatant refusal to learn from them.<br><br>Also, Despatch doesn&#39;t exist anymore, by the way, so we&#39;ve become even less likely to attack authors in any way except the &quot;my work is me&quot; way.<br><br>I doubt everyone here does that, and I also recognize that my response is coming out of nowhere for you, as I am just a newbie, but you can see that there are measures being taken to avoid these things.<br><br>*tips hat* Good day.

            <p>I&#39;m glad to hear those critical thinking skills came online and that you were able to use them to overcome your fears and achieve your goals. All the published writers I know have similar stories about facing not just the possibility of judgement, but real and repeated rejection, and eventually succeeding with perseverance. It&#39;s tough, and not everyone gets there. It&#39;s great that you were able to do so at such a young age.<br><br>As for your accusations, neither I nor anyone else need respond to them, because we already have <a href="https://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/FAQ:_For_Other_People">a recently updated FAQ</a> for that.<br><br>Kind regards,<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Since we don&#39;t seem to have one, I figured we could use a thread where we just toss in cool stuff we&#39;ve seen, read, been playing, and so on. <br><br>The other reason I&#39;m posting this is that I wanted to plug <a href="https://subsetgames.com/itb.html"><i>Into The Breach</i></a>. The basic idea of the game is that you&#39;ve running a squad of mechs who can go back in time to try and stop an alien invasion. Mechanically, the enemies plan out what attacks they&#39;ll be taking, then you take a turn to try and disrupt their plan (which can include interesting things like moving enemies around so they attack each other instead of your units or buildings), then they do their thing. <br><br>There&#39;s a few other cool things, like the fact that the missions are somewhat randomly generated and that, in between runs of the game, you can bring one of your mech pilots (who can level up and therefore give their mech buffs) with you to use in your next playthrough. (And there&#39;s a bunch of different squads that have various abilities so things don&#39;t get too repetitive.) Basically, this is a game I&#39;ve been having a lot of fun playing lately, and I&#39;d recommend it. (If it helps, it&#39;s by the same people who made <i>Faster Than Light</i>.)<br><br>- Tomash</p>

They&#39;re fantastically, amazingly funny, and you should go watch them right now.<br><br>In other news, John Romero&#39;s <a href="https://www.romerogames.ie/sigil/">SIGIL</a> is due for release this month, so people who own a copy of Doom... well, you can get on that.<br><br>And if you don&#39;t own a copy of Doom you can pick up every pre-Doom 3 Doom game for &lt;$5 on Steam right now.

Utter classic, and a total blast to play through.<br><br>I&#39;ve been reading Fabien Sanglard&#39;s utterly fantastic <i>Wolfenstein 3D Black Book</i>, but that&#39;s unlikely to be of interest to the non-programmers in the audience, so I won&#39;t go into detail.

Or possibly Metroid, as some have compared this game to?<br><br>Well, this game isn&#39;t enough like any of those to be a ripoff, so you&#39;ll likely enjoy Monster Sanctuary, a low-fantasy monster-training platformer! You play as the descendant of one of four families, descended from the first four Monster Keepers, who saw that monsters could be trained to be the ally of humanity and not its enemies. Hatch a team of monsters, fight wild monsters to make yours stronger, learn about a unique combat and leveling system, and figure out what&#39;s behind the unusual overpresence of boss monsters in the Sanctuary...<br><br>Or at least you will in the full game. This is just a demo, with the full version still being in development, but it still has a significant amount of content, and I can confess that I have been coming back for more even after the end of the demo&#39;s plot.

            <p>Heretic is... not my favorite Doom Engine game. It really is pretty much a Doom fantasy TC, and there&#39;s nothing wrong with that, but I don&#39;t think the design stands up to the original, level-wise. It&#39;s just not quite as fun. Pick up the original Doom first, IMHO.<br><br>So, for posterity, here is Thoth&#39;s Definitive Commercial Doom Engine Game Review:<br><br>-(The Ultimate) Doom: The game that started it all. Doom holds up amazingly well to this day... once you rebind the controls so that WASD works and lookspring is disabled. But other than that... man, this game is good. It looks good, it plays good, it just feels good. And so much of the level design is just rock solid. Especially anything John Romero touched. That man is a master. (and he&#39;s putting a new levelpack out for the game soon, by the way).<br><br>-Doom 2: Doom 2 introduced a lot of new  stuff. Chaingunners, Pain Elementals, Hell Knights, Mancubi, Revanents, Arachnotrons, and, of course, the amazing Super Shotgun. But sadly, I feel the design declined. Some of these levels are just exercises in frustration, and only a few of the 30 are really that memorable. The Icon of Sin is an exercise in frustration to beat, too. as in, I&#39;ve never won it. However, the maps are still mostly solid and the game is pretty fun. Most of all, this is the game that most of the fantastic Doom mapping community uses as the base for their levels. That alone makes it worth a buy, even if the game was awful (it isn&#39;t).<br><br>-Heretic: Okay, calling it &quot;just medival Doom&quot; is unfair. Heretic also added an inventory system, its weapons were slightly different, it had new enemies... the problem, again, comes from the overall design. Raven always felt like id&#39;s B-team, and the levels are just a little less clever, the spritework just a bit less evocative, the game just... a bit less *fun*. It&#39;s still good, but less so.<br><br>-Hexen: Heretic was still more of that good-old Doom style shooting, albeit with a few new tricks in there. But nobody can say that Hexen is more of the same. You got to pick one of three classes, and you could jump, right off the bat. Polyobjects (level elements that move horizontally) and an actual scripting language as well as numerous other under-the-hood enhancements to circumvent the Doom Engine&#39;s limitations and add new functionality mean that Hexen doesn&#39;t look  or play like any Doom Engine game before it. The world is more dynamic, and for once we&#39;re not just going level-to-level: there are hubworlds, and you may need to go back and forth between levels, or even go back into the same level from another starting point, slowly unlocking more and more levels. The item system has been expanded as well, allowing you to carry around key objects and do some more puzzling, and those puzzles, as well as combat that feels slower and more brutal, really set Hexen apart. Annnd... I really don&#39;t like Hexen much. Don&#39;t ask me why. I just don&#39;t. It&#39;s alright, but... no.<br><br>-Strife: Now Strife, while less technically advanced, is a much better game than Hexen in my opinion. It actually has a story, a dialogue system, not everything&#39;s trying to kill you, you can still jump... did I mention there are upgrades? And sidequests? And a (slightly) branching story? And a kinda-sorta stealth system? This game is great. Also, if you buy Strife (you want &quot;Strife: Veteran Edition&quot; not any of the unrelated games called Strife) on Steam, it doesn&#39;t play in dosbox, but actually in a modernized source port, and it actually includes a ton of content left on the cutting room floor (including a full multiplayer mode!) in it. If you have to buy one doom engine game that isn&#39;t doom... buy this one.<br><br>As for how to play these games... I don&#39;t endorse playing through DosBox like Steam does by default for most of them. Strife comes with a pretty killer source port, but for the rest of these, I suggest grabbing a sourceport from the internet, as they run better, are better supported, and tend to have more features than the original exes. GZDoom is the default suggestion nowadays: it&#39;s compatible with any doom mappack or mod you care to download (including the (in)famous Brutal Doom), runs all of the games mentioned above, and will automatically find game datafiles when you get them from Steam, so you don&#39;t have to do anything extra. For the true purists out there, Chocolate Doom (as well as Chocolate Heretic, Chocolate Hexen, and Chocolate Strife) plays these games the way they originally looked on DOS, but without all the bugs and glitches and nonsense. So yeah. </p>

            <p>I was a regular here ages ago - I want to say it was probably somewhere in the 2003-2007 range? I don’t know if anyone here remembers me; the only even vaguely familiar name I’ve noticed thus far is Huinesoron, and I have no memory of if or how much we interacted. Wow, it’s been a long time. I’ve been vaguely thinking about y’all for a while, but only found my way back when I happened to stumble on the PPC TVTropes page just now. Hi!<br><br>Something I’ve been thinking about a fair amount lately (and the reason I’ve been thinking about the PPC before now) is this:<br><br>Q: What do you call the male equivalent of a Mary Sue?<br>A: The protagonist. <br><br>Does anyone have any thoughts about how this, I don’t know, interacts with the core PPC concept? I haven’t (re)read any of canon yet, and I’m not intending this as an attack, I’m just honestly curious. </p>

            <p>The idea behind this question is that people are accusing far too many female leads of being Mary Sues and far too few male leads of being Gary Stus. This can be solved by having a concrete definition of Mary Sue/Gary Stu. Which we do! :D Also, I&#39;d like to point out that in fanfic, there are in existence many more Mary Sues than Gary Stus. That is not because women write worse, but because women write more fanfic in general. So that disparity isn&#39;t a disparity at all.<br><br>I&#39;ll leave the oldbies to talk about the rest.<br><br>-Twistey</p>

            <p>(If you&#39;re curious, the first record of you in the <a href="https://huinesoron.neocities.org/PPC/BoardArchive.html">Board Archives</a> is April 2005, and the last is December of the same; doesn&#39;t mean much, though, because the Archives are pretty patchy before &#39;08.)<br><br>The way I think of it, the original definition of a Mary Sue was &#39;a badly-written female self-insert&#39;. Over the years, different groups have focussed on different parts:<br><br>-The worst kinds have honed in on &#39;female&#39;, and they&#39;re exactly what you&#39;re talking about. The &#39;Rey is a Mary Sue!&#39; crowd hit this button (especially ironic since this is the same canon where a nine-year-old flies through an entire hostile fighter fleet and blows up a military starship back in <i>Phantom Menace</i>), and while I&#39;m not going to say they&#39;re awful <i>people</i>, their views stink.<br><br>-Almost as bad are the ones who focus on &#39;self-insert&#39; - ie, the &#39;Rey can&#39;t be a Mary Sue because she&#39;s definitely not a version of Abrams&#39;. This is not only a tool to put down any OCs in fanfic - most of which is still written by women &amp; girls - but is also disproportionately used against female writers in published fiction. The issue, really, is that it&#39;s kept just enough of the &#39;badly-written&#39; connotation to keep being used as a negative word, while not actually requiring you to check that bad writing is present.<br><br>-The PPC has taken what I think is the only reasonable approach: to focus on &#39;badly-written&#39;. I&#39;ve personally been advocating the use of <b>Suvian</b>, to refer to both Mary Sues and Gary Stus. Our definition doesn&#39;t care about what they&#39;re based on or even, specifically, what they look like (the Mary Sue Tests of the past, with &#39;falls in love with Legolas&#39; and &#39;astoundingly beautiful&#39; and the like, aren&#39;t really used any more); it&#39;s all about how they fit into the world - or rather, how they don&#39;t.<br><br>If you want to see what my approach to this looks like, <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10727893/1/PPC-Driftwood">PPC: Driftwood</a> is the series where I&#39;ve put it into practice. It&#39;s not the PPC of the old days, which <i>did</i> often take the easy path of saying &#39;she&#39;s a girl, she must be an author fantasy and a Sue&#39;; but I like to think things have changed since then.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I don&#39;t know if we ever interacted much, but anyway, welcome back!<br><br>As to the... joke? Is that a joke? Well, my answer is &quot;a Suvian by any other name smells as poorly written.&quot;<br><br>And, I must contradict Delta, <a href="https://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Mary_Sue">the definition we&#39;re currently using</a> definitely can encompass the likes of Eragon and Drizzt do&#39;Urden (and yeah, Bella Swann, too). While original characters in original works can&#39;t pull other characters and settings out of character in the same way as an original character in a fanfiction, they CAN receive incongruous treatment from other characters and break the rules of their worlds in ways that disrupt our ability to suspend disbelief, which amounts to the same thing: a protagonist with poor characterization and no real struggle placed in their path.<br><br>And we certainly spork male Suvians, if that&#39;s in question. Some examples are listed on the Gary Stu page that 61516 linked.<br><br>Not that there isn&#39;t bias in favor of male protagonists over female ones out there in the Serious Literature world, and probably in fanfiction, too. But fanfiction has always been more of a female hobby, as far as I&#39;m aware. Speaking of OC protagonists in fanfic, then, you get more female protagonists than male protagonists, and therefore—talking strictly numbers—more badly written female protagonists than badly written male protagonists. Percentage-wise, though, I reckon it&#39;s exactly the same. The old saying, 90% of everything is crap, applies to fanfiction and Serious Literature, male and female and everything else, all alike.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Thank you!<br><br>I think Huinesoron really hit the nail on the head with what I was trying to go for, which was more along the lines that most people are much more likely to call a female character Suvian than a male character.

            <p>Which, I like to think, may explain our confusion! We&#39;ve historically tended to incline progressive and feminist around here, which may seem ironic to other corners of the Internet, but I reckon that&#39;s why we&#39;ve survived. IMO, if you look at the Original Series, it&#39;s clear that the PPC was not founded on the idea that &quot;female OC = bad,&quot; but rather &quot;messing up the world you claim to be a fan of = bad,&quot; and the prevalence of female OCs at the heart of it is a byproduct of demographics, as I noted above.<br><br>Not that the PPC has always been a shining bastion of pure ideals or whatever, because that ain&#39;t the case, but I&#39;m with hS: we&#39;ve come a long way since the beginning, and those of us that have been here the longest have worked hard to put the focus on the objective quality of the writing, not the sex of the OCs, and especially not the writers.<br><br>BTW, out of curiosity, did you find your way back here because of the Citrus Scale? I hear a screenshot of that page from our wiki has been going around Tumblr lately.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Ah, that would indeed make sense. <br><br>I wasn’t entirely comfortable with at least parts of what I remembered of the PPC, but I’m really glad to see that a) I misremembered some of it and/or b) the culture has deliberately shifted away from those bits. <br><br>I just reread TOS, which is very clear about the focus on canon-warping, so I suspect(/half-remember) that the pieces I was less comfortable with were a few of the earlyish spinoffs that lost track of that a bit.

            <p>I was, in the Elder Days, known as Techno-Dann. A few things have changed since then. :)<br><br>That&#39;s a great question, and one that&#39;s come up in discussion here too. My thoughts go something like this:<br><br>First and foremost, we specifically only use Mary Sue to talk about fanfiction characters. The measure of a Mary Sue is not how tragic her backstory is, it&#39;s not how much power she has, it&#39;s how much she warps the story around her. It&#39;s how far away from canon she pulls characters, settings, and themes.<br><br>We&#39;ve stuck to that definition pretty hard, too - even in the face of <i>Eragon</i>, <i>Twilight</i>, <i>Fifty Shades</i>... the list of bad published fiction goes on, but those characters are by definition not Sues because the world exists for them, and their themes are the world&#39;s themes. Likewise, there are some truly good ladies in fiction out there who also cannot be Sues, because the story is <i>their story</i>: consider Imperator Furiosa from the latest Mad Max, for example. (Innuendo Studios does <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmR8A1a8shk">a really good feminist breakdown of Mad Max and tropes around women in action movies</a>. (CW: violence, discussion of very violent tropes))<br><br>To get into some more personal thoughts: I&#39;ve totally dreamed up wish-fulfillment self-insert fanfiction. I&#39;ve written more than a few, although I usually lean on original settings instead of fanfic. I recognized them as things I was writing for me rather than the world, and I chose to not put them on the internet. (The earliest sign I have that I wasn&#39;t the guy I thought I was? I stumbled across a cache of my really old writing, 2005-6ish, and in every single piece, the character I identified with most... was a girl.) And yeah, it&#39;d hurt to see someone go through them with a pair of Agents and mock them to fictional death, and yeah, I&#39;m not sure if &quot;having the self-awareness to recognize that this isn&#39;t something I&#39;m writing to be good writing&quot; is the best test for whether something should undergo that level of commentary.<br><br>(Quoth one of the hypothetical agents: &quot;Oh bright Athena, Juliette, will you <i>finish a scene for once?</i>&quot;)<br><br>Anyways! I don&#39;t have any conclusions, but there&#39;s some thoughts. The joke is sadly accurate, &quot;Mary Sue&quot; has been an insult thrown at a lot of women in fiction who dared be competent/interesting/capable, and that&#39;s rather uncool - but it&#39;s also a misuse of the term, and we&#39;ve been careful with its meaning here. And, yeah, I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;m comfortable making &quot;this is bad art&quot; the punchline of mine? But I&#39;ve also only written like one mission in ten years.<br><br>So, hi! There&#39;s a lot of words, I hope you find some of them interesting.<br><br>-Delta Juliette</p>

            <p>And... yeah, guys do tend to get off a bit lighter. However, the PPC have a pretty stringent definition of what a Sue *is*, which helps us avoid this.<br><br>Although I will note some articles I&#39;ve seen online about this are just... wrong. Like one that claims Paul Atreides is a godlike Stu and that&#39;s bad writing nobody noticed when Doom as a series (and particularly Doom Messiah) was all about deconstructing the Messianic Archetype: Making Paul like that was the point, so Herbert could show all the problems with it.</p>

            <p><b>Important note: content warning for material that could be distressing for survivors of childhood sexual assault in the very last paragraph of this post. It’s nothing remotely graphic or counter to Board rules - just the legal definition of a term - but far better to over-warn than under-warn.</b><br><br>Personally, I switched over to AO3 (the Archive Of Our Own, archiveofourown.org) years ago, and haven’t touched <s>the Pit of Voles</s> <s>the Den of Weasels</s> fanfiction.net in years. It is (mostly) invite-only - you can also request an invite directly, though I don’t know how long that takes. <br><br>I believe, though, they gave every account something like nine invites in response to the Tumblr apocalypse, so if anyone wants an invite, hit me up. <br><br>Personally, I’ve found that the average ‘fic quality is much higher than on e.g. ff.net; there’s probably some bias there, since I exclusively find new fic by going through the bookmarks of authors whose ‘fic I like. Even so, I’ve never seen anything as bad as you can find on ff.net (by which, to be clear, I mean that the lowest-quality ‘fic I see on AO3 is still much better than the lowest-quality ‘fic on Flickr.net).<br><br>AO3 is also very explicitly a safe space to post anything and everything - they have rules about user conduct, but IIRC the only explicitly-forbidden content is defined by law (e.g. no child pornography, under the legal definition thereof as photographic or video depictions of children in sexual situations). </p>

            <p>This was actually quite an interesting new take on PPC training!  Simulating field missions would allow for faster training overall, I think, cutting out some of the &quot;book learning&quot; prep time before agents get thrust into their first actual badfic.  I like that it actually starts the simulation in a phony RC, and I love the implication that DoSAT just used a generator to make up a fake badfic, rather than going to the trouble of trying to accurately digitize an existing badfic.<br><br>I feel like Bradbury has a bit of a stronger presence in this story than Gibbs does.  I&#39;ve got a good sense of Bradbury&#39;s dutiful outlook, and the value he places on his now defunct rank.  Gibbs, though, was pretty quiet throughout the whole piece.  In fact, other than his height and one allusion to Yark, his status as a giant lizard person didn&#39;t really come across much at all.  What does he eat?  Is the temperature in HQ at a healthy level for an ectotherm?  How weird are human social customs to him?  (Not that a human self-relating into a body-ball is a good example of human customs, but it&#39;s something that might come up more in a more standard mission.)  I do suggest giving Gibbs more of a voice in future stories.<br><br>I do like the technician quite a bit, though.  I particularly like that she clearly has some bad blood with one of the trainees, but still stays professional and jumps straight into her duty in training them . . . right up until Bradbury mouths off towards her at the end.  I&#39;m curious whether her silence is her coming up with a response, or whether she&#39;s simply left them in the simulation for a while until they&#39;re less argumentative?<br><br>Now some technical errors, in reverse-chronological order because that saves the nitpick-y one for last:<br><br>In the charge list: &quot;&#39;. . . <b>have</b> unreasonable angst about being special in unclear ways . . .&#39;&quot;<br>&quot;Have&quot; should be &quot;having&quot; to match the rest of the verbs in the charge list.<br><br>&quot;&#39;Let’s hold up on that. People deserve the benefit of the doubt.&#39;&quot;<br>The line break between this sentence and the bold badfic excerpt that follows it is missing.  (I <i>think</i> you want one there, though I could be wrong.)<br><br>And finally, in your opening notes, the title <i>Lord of the Rings</i> should technically be <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>.  Told you this one was a nitpick!<br><br>—doctorlit really wants to see Aragorn, Galadriel and Snape fighting crime together as Green Lanterns now</p>

Yes.<br>-You actually *do* need to tell everyone that your mission is rated for explicit language. We&#39;re PG unless otherwise noted, sooo...<br>-I wanna see more description out of you. All those incoherent perspective shifts and general nonsense no doubt creates a World World that looks like a freaking Escher painting for the agents. I wanna see them coping with that. I want descriptions of the insanity. But then, that could just be me. I like descriptions. :-P<br>-Your sense of humor is generally really sharp. Try and use that more, develop it out.

            <p>Very, <i>very</i> sarcastic in fact.  Sort of like a teach-by-showing-what-not-to-do situation.

            <p>Okay, I admit this is just an excuse for me to share stuff I&#39;ve been messing with, but anyone can do it, so...<br><br><a href="https://www.floorplanner.com">Design your agents&#39; RC with Floorplanner!</a><br><br>I did my agents&#39; RCs with this a long time ago, but they&#39;ve changed a bunch of stuff since then. The options (many, many options) all look a lot more realistic now. Downside: no color customization except on walls and floors. Upside: waste hours and hours searching for just the right furniture and accents! It&#39;s Fun! {= D (Or be less obsessive and perfectionist than I am, have fun, and also have something to show for it. ^<em>~ )<br><br>Suggested inner dimensions for RCs, in meters because that&#39;s the default:<br><br>Office Single (undivided living/office area) - 4m x 6m<br>Office Double (divided into 2-4 rooms) - 8.15m x 7.65m<br>Fancy Single (main area + closet &amp; bathroom) - 5.15m x 8.15m<br>Fancy Double (main area + 2 rooms, 2 closets, 1 bathroom) - 10.15m x 8.15m<br><br>As for exactly how the insides are arranged, I reckon HQ is nothing if not inconsistent, so go nuts. FYI, the Fancy Double is hella generous, like a proper apartment. You probably have to be a veteran <i>and</i> have kids <i>and</i> pull some serious <s>shenanigans</s> strings to get one of those.<br><br>Other tips: I&#39;ve used the Greek Texture surface for the floors. I think the White Lacquer Entertainment Unit with a Mixer Console on it makes a half-convincing console. Stick a Kitchen Single Cabinet next to it and mount a Digital Jukebox Icon Storm on there, and it&#39;ll pass for the disguise generator.<br><br>The first thing I&#39;ve updated that I&#39;m calling done is the FicPsych foyer:<br><br>&lt;a href=&quot;<a href="https://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/File:FicPsych">https://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/File:FicPsych</a></em>foyer.png&quot;&gt;<img src="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/ppc/images/d/dd/FicPsych_foyer.png/revision/latest?cb=20190206052123" width="500"></a><br><br>If you follow the link to the wiki, you can see the old version and the new version to compare. Mainly, the walls are less janky, the nurses&#39; station is built into the space rather than tacked on the outside, and the whole thing is just neater. For reference, the diameter of the whole circle would be 12 meters, the length of the long, straight wall, and so it&#39;s 6m from the main entrance to the doorway to Unit A. The curve isn&#39;t a real half-circle, but a) I couldn&#39;t get the walls to bend like that, and b) this is probably more functional anyway.<br><br>And here is Jenni&#39;s RC, which is an Office Single:<br><br><a href="https://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/File:C-14.png"><img src="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/ppc/images/a/a1/C-14.png/revision/latest?cb=20190206061531"></a><br><br>Notably, this version is pre-Henry, so there&#39;s a bookshelf in the place where a kid&#39;s bed will go later. I&#39;m less than thrilled with the grassy green rug, but oh well, close enough. At least it livens up the image.<br><br>I might put together slideshows of these in 3D so you can see what it&#39;s like to be inside, but not tonight.<br><br>So, what about the rest of you? Care to give it a shot? {= D<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>When I saw Floorplanner had been changed a few months ago, I&#39;ll admit my first thought was annoyance. I&#39;m rather fond of the more cartoony version they had before (and with a bit of dorking around, I was able to still edit my saved RCs in the old version, but I couldn&#39;t add new items). <br><br>Your redesign does look good, though, so maybe I&#39;ll have to stop my grumbling and give them another go.</p>

            <p><br>Approximately eight hours later, Tiger was snoring silently. Admittedly that was only because he’d cast a snoring spell on himself and the girls were too fed up with listening to it so had silenced him. <br><br>His mission wasn’t really going that well: he was securely trapped in a cage made out of magically reinforced chairs and had so far heard nothing of use to him.<br><br>Out of one half-closed eye, he spotted Sarah, the girls’ leader, heading in his direction and internally groaned.<br><br>“Wake up!” she said, poking him.<br><br>Tiger jerked upright but said nothing as he had been silenced. Right, he told himself, you have no idea what’s happened for the last nine hours and you have a massive hangover.<br><br>“So,” asked Sarah, “why were you stupid enough to get drunk?”<br><br>Tiger said nothing. <br><br>“Oh. Right. Silencing spell.” She muttered something. “That should do it. Now answer my question.”<br><br>Tiger found he was able to talk. “Drunk?” he asked. “I only remember having one glass…” He clutched his forehead, imagining a pounding headache.<br><br>“Why did you drink anything when you know that it is against your own father’s rules?”<br><br>“Well, I figured it couldn’t do any harm, just one glass… everyone was having some.”<br><br>“Whose idea was it to drink in the first place?”<br><br>“Martin’s. He found a bottle somewhere and proposed a celebration of our impending victory.”<br><br>Sarah looked at Tiger as if he had gone mad. “No way,” she said. “Even Martin wouldn’t be that stupid… unless…”<br><br>Tiger could tell that she had worked it out. He wasn’t altogether surprised. “Unless what?” he asked, already knowing the answer.<br><br>“Unless… you were pretending to be drunk… so you could spy…”<br><br>“I don’t know what you’re talking about. That would be the worst plan I’ve ever heard.”<br><br>“I know Martin,” Sarah said. “I dated him last year. He is just the sort to make a plan like that.”<br><br>Tiger sighed. “Okay. Fine. I admit it. I’m a spy. Now what?”<br><br>Sarah hesitated.<br><br>“I have an idea,” said Tiger suddenly. “How about I spy for you?”<br><br>Sarah blinked. “You… want to switch sides.”<br><br>“Yeah. I’ve had enough of working for an idiot. What would you like Martin to think your plans are?”<br><br>“Hang on… how do I know you’re not just faking it to escape?”<br><br>That was a good point. “You don’t,” he said, knowing that there was nothing that he could do to persuade her that he was going to stick with his new side. He wasn’t even sure of it himself. It would be very satisfying to beat Martin, but on the other hand he also really wanted to beat his sister. <br><br>“True enough, I guess…” Sarah was clearly thinking about this quite hard. “I’ll need to talk about this with the others. I’ll be back in a minute.”<br><br>She walked away from Tiger, who returned to his slump. Even though he didn’t actually have a hangover, the dizziness spells were taking longer to wear off than he’d expected.<br><br><i> To be continued... </i><br></p>

            <p>Ha! Indeed. ;)<br><br>The one thing that made it marginally less terrifying was that, if it had been what they suspected, it wouldn’t have actually been cancerous. It would have been a benign tumor pressing on my optic nerve, only even needing addressing because the optic nerve part would have otherwise eventually made me go blind. <br><br>The other good news is that my symptoms could be caused by a couple of relatively minor things I already knew about.

            <p>You know how it is - sometimes, you just get an urge to take over the entire world. Unfortunately that&#39;s frowned on in polite society, but luckily, computer games have your back!<br><br>There have been a great many games dedicated to letting you play through the history of the world, creating great art, building vibrant cities, and crushing other civilisations under your fancy boots. But which of them is the best?<br><br>No, I don&#39;t mean anything crass like &#39;gameplay&#39;. What we want to know is: which of them lets you conquer the most nations on the planet?<br><br><u>1999 - Age of Empires II</u><br><br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/vAmrFlLh.png"><br><br>Sequel to 1997&#39;s <i>Age of Empires</i>, which featured 16 civilisations mostly from Europe, and prequel to 2005&#39;s <i>Age of Empires III</i>, which had 14, AoE II takes the crown in its series with no less than <b>31</b> nations present. Europe is of course heavily represented, but Northern Africa gets its dues too (there are 4 African nations, counting Saladin&#39;s Saracens). Asia has a fair showing, but Australasia is left out entirely, and the Americas have only three nations between them (the Aztecs, Maya, and Inca).<br><br>It&#39;s worth noting that the reason AoEII has so many nations, and so much global representation, is that they&#39;ve actually been adding new expansion packs recently. To a 20-year-old game. It&#39;s good stuff.<br><br><u>2003 - Rise of Nations</u><br><br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/YQ7BSSwh.png"><br><br>Microsoft&#39;s entry into the genre only has 24 civilisations, but in some ways they actually come out ahead. I&#39;m not talking about that huge blue blob in Africa - that&#39;s &#39;Bantu&#39;, which is a really broad term. But the Americas are up to 6 nations (only 1 less than Europe!), and two of those are extant Native American tribes (&#39;Lakota&#39; and &#39;Iroquois&#39;).<br><br><u>2005 - Empire Earth II</u><br><br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/EFGol6ph.png"><br><br>Once again, the second in the series takes the throne. <i>Empire Earth</i> (2001) actually had more nations, hitting 21, but two of those were fictional, and the others were heavily concentrated in Europe (they are the only entry in this page to let you play as Israel, though). <i>Empire Earth III</i> (2007) had... three. We don&#39;t talk about that.<br><br>EEII, however, has a nice set of 18, spread around the globe. Compared to the previous entries, it&#39;s lacking in a lot of areas, though it does have the unique-in-this-post existence of the Maasai.<br><br>And now, it&#39;s time to jump genres...<br><br><u>2016 - Civilization VI</u><br><br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/ukbBoGsh.png"><br><br>Because you can&#39;t talk about conquering the world without talking Civ. I&#39;ve chosen to use the most recent entry here, but they&#39;re all pretty heavy on the nations:<br><br>-Civ (1991): 14<br>-Civ II (1996): 21<br>-Civ III (2001): 31 (matching AoE II)<br>-Civ IV (2005): 34<br>-Civ V (2010): 43<br>-Civ VI (2016): 42... so far<br><br>And there is a <i>lot</i> of coverage here. Asia is almost full, and places like Brazil, Australia, and Canada get their first appearances alongside the likes of Georgia and Scotland. We&#39;ve got a new entry in the Native American roster - the Cree. Even Africa gets a good deal out of Civ, with Arabia and Phoenicia (Carthage) sharing space with Egypt, Nubia, Mali, Kongo, and Zulu.<br><br>Now, I&#39;m not about to declare Civ the single best way to conquer the history of the world - I&#39;m sure there are other options! So what are they, and do any of them do anything with Australia other than put some guy in a funny hat?<br><br>hS<br><br>PS: I really wanted to include <i>Command and Conquer: Red Alert 2</i>, which lets you play as a dozen different countries. But really, there&#39;s only two sides, with the nations just a way to pick your unique unit. Still, though - &quot;It will be a sssilent ssspring...&quot; ~hS</p>

            <p>Welcome to the wonderful world of <a href="https://eu4.paradoxwikis.com/images/5/51/Countries.png">Europa Universalis IV</a><br><br>The above is a map of all the nations present at the start of the game, that being in the year 1444 (the game ends in 1821). More are possible to be founded or punted out of larger nations via a peace deal; indeed, this is a very good way of weakening larger nations like Ming China, the Ottomans, and so on. Not only can that be done, but other nations can be formed if, say, a colony becomes independent or a nation fulfils certain requirements.<br><br>In total, not including special tags for things like rebels and pirates or special nations that can only appear in the game when added in via outside sources like Jomsvikingr, the Roman Empire, or Jan Mayen (long story), there are seven hundred and eighty-seven unique nation tags in Europa Universalis IV. Okay, you won&#39;t see all of them at once. You can&#39;t; some, like the Chinese minors, are dependent on a Mingsplosion (as she is called), which is far from guaranteed to happen and something you really have to hope <i>doesn&#39;t</i> happen if you&#39;re, for example, playing as Ming.<br><br>Oh, did I not mention that they&#39;re all playable?<br><br>Because they&#39;re all playable.<br><br>And you can conquer the world with <b>all of them</b>.<br><br><a href="https://eu4.paradoxwikis.com/Achievements#The_Three_Mountains">There&#39;s even an achievement for doing it with Ryukyu. =]</a></p>

            <p>Europa Universalis is a grand strategy title. You have provinces, you have armies, you can develop your nation&#39;s ideas over time, and you can use your military might to beat people up. It&#39;s a bit like Risk, but bigger and more in-depth and you can play it on your own (so a fun version of Risk. =] ).<br><br>And yeah, it&#39;s <i>absolutely</i> feasible to conquer the world with Wales; you just need to be smart about it. More than anything, EUIV is a game about diplomacy; building alliances with big friends until you&#39;re big enough to stand and fight alone - and then you can take on the big friends you had previously, kick them in the shins, and nick all their stuff. Also, if you&#39;re playing as Wales (or any releasable nation), you have to start as the overlord - which means you can trash their economy, disband their armies, and burn their forts to the ground before releasing the nation you want to play as and switching to them.<br><br>Wales has actually got really good national ideas for conquering a large empire, too - solid Traditions right out of the gate, a fantastic Ambition (+25% land force limit like whaaaaaaaaaaat), and a lot of unrest control in between. Yes, it&#39;s going to be <i>tricky</i> to unite the planet under the Welsh banner, but that&#39;s all part of the fun! =]<br><br>To give you an example of that game&#39;s gameplay, especially when playing as someone very very small, here&#39;s noted player of the game Arumba doing a run as one-province nation Navarra on the most recent DLC, &quot;Golden Century&quot;:-<br><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3-SefO9SyE&amp;index=2&amp;t=0s&amp;list=PLH-huzMEgGWDwU9RvAVdAmGbksRotSDGy">Navarra&#39;s Golden Century</a><br><br>I hope it is informative. =]</p>

            <p>So, updates on the PPC strategy games:<br><br>- <b>Plortish Warfare:</b> I put Delta Juliette in charge of the Plort strategy game, as she actually wrote some stuff about Plortish warfare. No further progress has happened about that. She also hasn&#39;t acknowledged my promotion of her to the head of the project.<br><br>- <b>Mass Mission:</b> I was debating with hS about whether he should undertake the mass mission strategy game. He mentioned a PPC board game he came up with earlier that was really bad. Perhaps fixing that is a good starting point, and then we can amp up the scale.<br><br>- <b>Shiny Newbie:</b> hS is undertaking this project, which has gone from being a strategy game to a visual novel. (I think.) I mentioned an idea to him that at one point in time, the player could play as a badficcer who was sporked and got on the Board to look for answers (while not telling anyone who they were), it  has not been responded to.<br><br>- <b>Boarder Wars:</b> Since I haven&#39;t gotten enough support to make an actual Axis and Allies parody, I&#39;m instead going to research on how to make a Boarder-themed <i>Hearts of Iron 4</i> reskin, which I shall call &quot;Hearts of Bleeprin.&quot; As HoI4 is a WWII game, I&#39;m going to make the sacrifice of taking Germany (unless someone legitimately wants it), so who else wants a country?<br><br>-Twistey</p>

            <p>I&#39;m an English teenager who goes by the name of QuantumMelody29 on the internet! I found the PPC via tvtropes and started reading the original series a week or so ago. I also read the constitution and most of the FAQs on the wiki. I&#39;m not particularly active in any fandoms but I am a fan of Pokemon, Minecraft, Terraria, Yo kai watch, tomodachi life, miitopia and gachaverse/gacha life. Literature that I am a fan of include the CHERUB series and Artemis Fowl. I love the star wars franchise, but have not watched some of the more recent movies. I have however, watched the star wars holiday special, and I now enjoy watching other people on youtube reacting to it. My favorite music genre is electro. As of yet, probably my favorite agent is Len, because the flamethrower crazy story description is hilarious and I love comedy. In my spare time I post on forums, watch youtube, read internet stuff and play games. I also like roleplaying. For some reason, I am obsessed with Japanese food, like mochi, ramen and teryaki beef. So, yeah. Hi.</p>

            <p>I know I already posted not so long ago, so... uh, sorry?<br>Anyway, the book is called “The Tragic Tale of the Celestial Lily and Crystal Silver”<br>————<br>Excerpt:<br>Crystal stares at the newcomer. No one has defied her before- surely this is not her author’s doing? She is perfect and the other characters are nothing compared to her, so how dare this-!!!<br><br>The Celestial Lily- or Lily Silversmith- stares at the queen. Her demon deal should have warped everyone’s feelings for her, right? So why…?<br>————<br>Crystal is a fourth wall-breaking Mary Sue who has a superiority complex because she has her author’s favor, and Lily is a “Mary Sue” who made a deal with a demon to be super powerful and loved and all that, and together they must... um, defeat the demon that Crystal unleashed to make her deal, I guess.<br>Basically two characters with superiority complexes and deep-rooted insecurities about the fact that they didn’t earn their positions clash while everyone else assumes they’re friends, because they’re both “perfect”. So the fate of the world should definitely not be in their hands, but that”s okay, because according to Crystal, it’s a book, and the heroes always win in books!<br>I also have no idea how collaboration is going to actually work so there’s that.</p>

            <p>Not via Google Docs or anything, just by offering tips on writing a &quot;badfic except it&#39;s good&quot; story. Let me begin by saying that you&#39;ll have to find some legitimate way to sustain the book once the gimmick of it being a parody runs out. In my game Sue VS Sue, I do this by making the Suvians actually likeable characters who have good personality behind all those cliches and power. You could try taking that route, or you could possibly add a third character who&#39;s actually sane, the real hero of the story, for the readers to invest in. Otherwise it&#39;ll be just like badfic itself - people will only read it for cheap laughs.<br><br>-Twistey</p>

            <p>Hi! I&#39;m a Dutch teenager who just recently found out about the PPC through the wiki. I&#39;ve recently started reading the original series. I&#39;ve also read the constitution and the FAQ. I&#39;m a fan of the Fallout series, The Hunger Games, Doctor Who, Star Trek and Sherlock. I love Kpop and watching youtube. I don&#39;t really have a favorite agent yet as I&#39;m pretty bad at choosing. I&#39;m a D&amp;D fan, I&#39;ve both played it and watched series of people playing it (Critical Role) I&#39;ve been dancing for around 8-9 years. I also play guitar and a little bit of piano. <br><br>That&#39;s about it! hi!</p>

So... to make a long story short (mind you, that takes an effort), here I am. <br><br>Be nice. :) </p>

            <p>I&#39;m glad that this community has changed people&#39;s minds about fanfic. That&#39;s a win in my book.<br><br>For your newbie gift, here&#39;s a vial of white liquid that shines purple and gold. It&#39;s a potion made of ground-up Nether Stars from Minecraft. It renders great power, but also causes really bad mutations. I haven&#39;t made any in a while, but I decided to make a batch <i>for science!</i> Probably a bad idea, considering that only one person knows how to create the antidote and she doesn&#39;t come to the Board that often... but anyway!

            <p>Hey, nobody should ever give you flak for being older and in fandom. Have an anti-flak jacket, and a Generic Blunt Object(TM) for beating off anyone who tries. The idea that older women, in particular, should have to give up all their fandom interests after a certain age is ageist, sexist, and generally nonsensical. <br><br>If you have trouble finding quality fanfic, may I recommend AO3 (Archive of Our Own, archiveofourown.org)? I find that the quality there is much higher than e.g. <s>the Pit of Voles</s> <s>the Den of Weasels</s> fanfiction.net. (No insult is intended to anyone who reads or writes there - that’s just apparently become the official name for it in my head.)<br><br>I noticed in another thread that you’re into MCU, among other things; may I recommend works by Copperbadge (<a href="https://archiveofourown.org/users/copperbadge"><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/users/copperbadge">https://archiveofourown.org/users/copperbadge</a></a>) and SciFiGrl47 (<a href="https://archiveofourown.org/users/scifigrl47/pseuds/scifigrl47"><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/users/scifigrl47/pseuds/scifigrl47">https://archiveofourown.org/users/scifigrl47/pseuds/scifigrl47</a></a>) as a starting place? I pretty much exclusively find new fic by looking through the bookmarks of authors whose work I enjoy. </p>

            <p>I’ve lost the article that linked me to it, but have any of y’all seen the (relatively) recent photograph of the Andromeda galaxy from NASA? It’s <b>stunning</b>. It’s the sharpest ever image of the Andromeda galaxy, and if I remember correctly, it’s something like 1.5 BILLION pixels, so warning, this is not necessarily data- or mobile-friendly. You may need to wait for things to load every time you zoom in, but give it time - it’s absolutely worth it. <br><br><a href="https://www.spacetelescope.org/images/heic1502a/zoomable/"><a href="https://www.spacetelescope.org/images/heic1502a/zoomable/">https://www.spacetelescope.org/images/heic1502a/zoomable/</a></a><br><br>Personally, one of my favorite spots is the bright red dot at the very top edge, at about a quarter to a third of the way in from the top left corner. </p>

            <p>She said that she wanted to invent a DEX-casting class, and then you (hS) said that a DEX cleric was in the works.<br><br>By the way, is anyone in agreement when I say that Order of the Bumblebee needs a wiki? If we count the Knights spinoff and the League spinoff as canon, we have 19 characters in the three parties alone. There&#39;ll definitely be more background characters on my side at least, plus there&#39;s all of the League&#39;s worldbuilding and one for how Aldegund&#39;s patron works, etc. A wiki would be a really good place to store so much content, plus it&#39;d attract more attention to the comic, and through it, to the PPC. That&#39;s my thoughts on that. Please tell me the name &quot;Bumblepedia&quot; isn&#39;t taken.<br><br>-Twistey</p>

            <p>But at the moment, the only actual content for the setting is five one-shot pictures and a fistful of character descriptions.
