            <p>And thank you, hS, for the perfect place to put this thing I was debating about posting. ^<em>^<br><br>So, first, I was taken by the whim to do an external links search for all Freewebs URLs and change them to either working Webs URLs or archival links. That&#39;s done.<br><br>In the process, I noticed just how awful the &lt;a href=&quot;<a href="https://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Legal">https://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Legal</a></em>Department&quot;&gt;Legal Department</a> page was, so I rewrote it. (This is a return to my project of standardizing and improving all the department pages, which I haven&#39;t worked on in quite a long time.) I pretty much only used the information in the links that were already there, though, so if anybody knows something I missed, please tell me! Legal is kind of important, and also complex and mysterious. Like, even the metahistory of the department head and flash patch is kinda freaky. Check it out, and let me know what you think happened in-universe. I&#39;ve got my own theory. {= )<br><br>While you&#39;re there, you may also notice that I finally discovered an easy way to get multiple images in the infoboxes (just use a gallery!), so I&#39;ve done that for all the department pages with multiple versions of their flash patch available. Now I can merrily add the ones I&#39;ve made to give them a more consistent style while not bumping the older designs into oblivion! ^_^ Also, this can be done with ANY infobox, so if you have multiple images of your agents, minis, Flowers, or whatever, feel free to add them to their infobox!<br><br>This has had the pleasant side-effects of reminding my brain how to focus on things and giving me some ideas, so more writing is also in the works. If anybody remembers the interlude I started quite a while back with Nume getting stuck babysitting Henry, I&#39;ve finally figured out where that&#39;s going. It should be fun for us and Fun for Nume. *g*<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>To be fair, it wasn&#39;t <i>awful</i> before—there were references, courtesy of HG (and thank you!), but they needed proper formatting. Otherwise it was kinda disorganized and sketched in, like a lot of these pages, and there was a pretty obvious editorial disagreement about the existence of &quot;Agent&quot; Murphy. Like, okay, I don&#39;t think THAT Murphy probably works for Legal either, really, <i>probably</i>, even if Agent Meg thinks so... but the place to fight about it is the Board or a Talk page, yeah?<br><br>Anyway, having now studied the matter, I&#39;m pretty sure the Antigravity Apple and the Fern are BOTH heads of Legal. They&#39;re both on the flash patch, after all. *g* They probably just switch off who takes the credit/blame sometimes, and the Apple handles DIAU on the side because it&#39;s a small department and it probably just felt like it.

            <p>A while ago, I shared <a href="http://filfre.net">The Digital Antiquarian</a>, a website about the history of digital culture and interactive entertainment that I profoundly enjoyed.<br><br>Now, the creator of <i>that</i> website has made a companion site, called <a href="https://analog-antiquarian.net">The Analog Antiquarian</a>, described as &quot;chronicles of worldly wonders,&quot; the new site has articles about mankind&#39;s most amazing achievements over all of history.

            <p>That space rock Ultima Thule, as well as Thule the car-mounted storage box company, is named after a fictional, far-northern lost civilization.<br><br>Originally named Hyperborea, meaning &quot;above the north wind&quot;, the idea was invented by Greek writers. It was stated to be a place where the boundaries between land, sea, and sky blurred, and instead there was this weird stuff that was kind of like Jello, which it was hard to move in. (Like... what?)<br><br>Unfortunately, around the early twentieth century, the concept (which I&#39;m not sure when it got renamed Thule, but it was in fact also called Ultima Thule) was pretty badly hijacked. (Use your imagination.) This is why it appears in the 2009 Wolfenstein reboot. Out of those who currently believe that Thule exists, many of them are of this ideology.<br><br>However, another large number of Thule-believers are folks from various countries in Europe who insist that the Greeks were talking about their nation.<br><br>TL;DR: Humans are weird.

            <p>I&#39;d not heard of the jelly-amalgam, but it sounds like their kind of thing - a place where all the elements become one, etc etc. Hyperborea also makes a famous appearance in the George MacDonald children&#39;s story <i>At the Back of the North Wind</i>, which is... kinda dark, actually.<br><br>Also, Wikipedia positively delights in telling us that Hyperborea is the land beyond the North Wind, and the North Wind lived in Thrace (southern Bulgaria), &#39;therefore Hyperborea indicates that it is a region beyond Thrace&#39;.

            <p>Woo, Francium. ...I ran out of things to say about this, so let me talk about something else.<br><br>Here in the PPC, we have a large number of MMO fans. Personally, MMOs make me feel like I&#39;m killing myself slowly. I wish they didn&#39;t, they look like an awful lot of fun, but sadly they are not for me q.q.<br><br>However, there IS an MMO related thing that I&#39;d recommend to even the MMO intolerant like me, and that thing is called <i>Log Horizon</i>.<br><br><i>Log Horizon</i> is a anime and (actually officially translated for once) novel series that can roughly be described as fulfilling the promises Sword Art Online made and then some. A collection of gamers are transported into a fantasy world that veeery closely resembles their favorite MMO which they were logged into before they showed up. Okay, so, race to get home, if you die in the game you die for real, and all that jazz, right?<br><br>No.<br><br><i>Log Horizon</i> is more interesting than that. It&#39;s about taking an anarchic group of people in a horrible situation and the political gambles and underhanded dealings it takes to turn that into a society. Especially when the world operates by MMO rules (<i>actual</i> MMO rules. As in, the author is obviously a dedicated MMO player), and nobody can <i>die</i>. And the NPCs are real people now, of course. Who most definitely <i>can</i> die, and are experiencing tensions with their immortal neighbors from the start.<br><br>And of course, our protagonist can do the Gendo Ikari Glasses Flash™, because he&#39;s a very manipulative man. The point is, <i>Log Horizon</i> is good stuff.<br><br>In other anime news, <i>The Lord El-Melloi II Case Files</i>, my favorite Fate-verse work you can&#39;t actually easily read because it&#39;s been translated terribly, has now got an Anime adaption, which is currently airing. So... yey. I dunno how many of you will care, but I&#39;m happy.<br><br>In videogame news, over the past few months Counter-Strike: Global Offensive has become free-to-play. If you&#39;re interested in joining the world&#39;s second-largest Valve-operated saltmine, you can check that out. But protip: bring some friends. You can play with publics, but it&#39;s less fun because most of them are... awful. Not gonna lie.<br><br>Also, it has a Battle Royale mode now, which is apparently actually fun, I wouldn&#39;t know.<br><br>In videogame not-news... have you ever wondered why WASD is <i>the</i> control scheme that we all use? It seems random, and... it was. In another universe, we could all be using ESDF (like Gabe Newell prefers), or WADX, or even SZXC.<br><br>So what made WASD win? E-sports. Namely, the one of the first ever e-sports champions, before that term even existed: Dennis &quot;Thresh&quot; Fong. For the full story, check out <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/how-wasd-became-the-standard-pc-control-scheme/">this article from PC Gamer</a>.<br><br>Oh, in actual gaming news, Erik Wolpaw is confirmed to be contracting for Valve, even if he&#39;s not back at the company. Speaking as someone who believes that Wolpaw&#39;s one of the best comedy writers in the industry, I think this is good. Maybe. It depends on whether Valve will actually DO something.<br><br>I&#39;m totally gonna get back to writing. Soon. I swear. Lessons 2 is only months away. :-P<br><br>No, seriously, my schedule&#39;s clearing up soon, so that may well be possible.</p>

            <p>Although I do think <i>Log Horizon</i> is the more interesting setting to think about the implications of, I just find SAO more entertaining to watch. <br><br>Funnily enough, the &#39;Aliceization&#39; story arc (the currently airing series of SAO) has the setting shift more into the <i>Log Horizon</i> style, with the &#39;NPCs&#39; being fully real people that can actually die. <br><br>-Irish </p>

            <p>Phobos and I are nearly finished with the second season, so while I have to say season two is not as good as season one, it&#39;s still full of a lot of the same elements that make season one really great. The perspective is fresh and interesting, the characters are likeable and engaging, and the mystery of what happened and why gets a bit more attention.<br><br>Also there&#39;s a whole character arc with the young bard, Isuzu, and how the world only has 42 songs, and it kinda drags its heels a bit, but music literally makes the world a better place!

            <p>... then I can also recommend <i>Grimgar: Ashes and Illusions</i>. It&#39;s a short anime, only 12 episodes I think, and setting wise it sort of falls between <i>Sword Art Online</i> and <i>Log Horizon</i> - it&#39;s set in a world that has game-style mechanics, as opposed to literally being a game, but there&#39;s no MMO style resurrection. If you die, you die. <br><br>And the characters are protagonists rather than &#39;heroes&#39; - when they arrived in their new world they lost the memories of their old lives; starting with no equipment and limited funds. At first they have to work together as a group just to take down single goblins. <br><br>The story style is a bit more like <i>Log Horizon</i>, but focuses on small group politics/interactions rather than larger scale dynamics, and is mostly about how difficult it is to survive in the world when everything costs money, and the only regular source of income is monster hunting.  <br><br>Also, the artwork is fantastic.<br><br>-Irish</p>

            <p>Our good old friend Pieguy has published a thing!  He wrote the practice adventure scenario in the quickstart guide for a new tabletop game called <i>Relics: A Game of Angels</i>.

            <p>...ideally you shouldn&#39;t write a mission before you get Permission and then publish it when you get Permission. I say this because this hereto unforeseen guideline prevents people from getting Permission and then accidentally or intentionally wrecking the PPC universe. Why not instead just hold off on writing any more for these misisons, and then when you have Permission, re-read and get others to beta-read them before you publish them to make sure that they follow PPC canon properly?<br><br>-Twistey</p>

            <p>And sorry, I didn&#39;t know about the cameos. Anyway, I already have an alternate solution to him returning in case people don&#39;t like what I&#39;m doing with his character - but I would like to bring him back if possible, please. Right now, all I have planned for him is a supporting role in my agents&#39; first mission, and I thought of having him along because the fic I picked is one heck of a bleepfic, and I thought an extra agent might come in handy.</p>

I&#39;m just sayin&#39; that if Sean&#39;s been lost in a plothole or something all this time, he may not have any more intestinal fortitude than the raw rookies, and remember, he&#39;s almost as much of a flake as Lux.

            <p>If it&#39;s any consolation, it caused a great deal of pain to me, too.

            <p>So... part of the point of Permission is checking that you&#39;re set to write decent PPC missions. If you&#39;re writing them in advance, please give them a thorough second draft before you post them afterwards, because the discussion around your Permission request (which will hopefully be successful!) will definitely contain points that the PGs think you need to keep in mind when writing.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Okay, this is possibly (probably?) a stupid question, but: why did Anakin Skywalker fall to the Dark Side? My memory of <i>Revenge of the Sith</i> is that he told Mace Windu that Palpatine was a Sith Lord, which is the act of a Jedi. He then walked in on Mace and Palpy fighting, with Palpatine claiming that his Force Lightning was a self-defence move, rather than the blatantly obvious attack it was. And then Palpy told him he could save Padme, and Anakin went &#39;welp, time to murder a Jedi Master and then go massacre some kiddies!&#39;.<br><br>What... what happened in there? Does this mean the stuffy ol&#39; Jedi Order was 100% correct about insisting that Jedi shouldn&#39;t be allowed to fall in love? The Light Side of the Force can&#39;t actually save people&#39;s lives from vaguely-defined Death, so even if Yoda and Obi-Wan had run Anakin&#39;s bachelor party, we would still have hit &#39;the Dark Side says it can save her when I can&#39;t&#39;.<br><br>But I can&#39;t believe George Lucas&#39; final message was &#39;love is terrible and leads to killing kids&#39;. So why <i>does</i> Anakin fall - and what path would have led to him not doing so?<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>He cut his hand off in defence of Palpatine (who had ostensibly surrendered), and Palpatine murdered him by throwing him off a building.<br><br>After that, I guess Anakin&#39;s guilt for his role in Windu&#39;s death and his mistrust of the Jedi - and presumably he expected that he wouldn&#39;t exactly be welcomed back into the Order after defending a Sith Lord against a Jedi Master - led to him deciding &quot;what the hell&quot; and jumping off the slippery slope.<br><br>Actually, a comparison comes to mind - Redcloak, from The Order of the Stick. Like Anakin, Redcloak has a goal, and an exquisitely monstrous person offering him a path to that goal. And they both end up doing terrible things for that person in order to achieve their goal - Redcloak kills his own little brother; Anakin in complicit in the death of Mace Windu. That then leaves them with no excuse for their behaviour, so they cling to achieving their goals instead, in the service of the evil creature who they pretend to themselves can help them achieve it.<br><br>So that&#39;s it - Anakin defends a Sith from a Jedi in the heat of the moment, then continues to serve Palpatine because that gives him an excuse for his inexcusable behaviour - &quot;it&#39;s to save my wife&quot;.<br><br>Of course, it&#39;s a selfish goal, because Anakin is ultimately pretty selfish.<br><br>And another thought, about the younglings - Anakin&#39;s super arrogant, and arrogance hates being judged. Wiping out the Jedi order was possibly, on Anakin&#39;s part, a desperate attempt to avoid being judged for his actions. In that light, the apprentices weren&#39;t children - they were part of the group which would seek to judge Anakin for his actions, and thus targets.<br><br>Of course, this was all ultimately precipitated by Palpatine&#39;s (and Jar Jar&#39;s) careful stroking of his ego and infatuation with Padmé. There was probably some subtle Force Suggestion involved, too.<br><br>In summary: Annie&#39;s an arrogant, selfish person who accidentally touched the slippery slope and then went &quot;what the hell&quot; because he didn&#39;t want his feelings hurt.</p>

            <p>First, his upbringing. Anakin is an exceptional Jedi, immensely talented and extremely powerful. It teaches him a kind of arrogance, a belief that he really can do anything. And after all, why not? He&#39;s the Chosen One. Obi-Wan recognizes this, but his attempts to keep him humble only lead to Anakin feeling starved for recognition, which he receives not from his Master or from the Jedi, but from the Chancellor.<br><br>Which leads nicely into point two, the Clone Wars. Anakin&#39;s fatal flaw throughout the Prequel trilogy has always been his fear of loss. During the Clone Wars, Anakin loses friend after friend after friend, whther they be Clone Troopers or Jedi. In addition, his accomplishments as a general are still not recognized by the Jedi. Enter, Palpatine, who is there to encourage and manipulate him every single time the Jedi disappoint him. Over the course of the war his faith in the Council is shaken, his fear of loss is intensified, and his trust of Palpatine grows.<br><br>Finally, we come to the revelation that Palpatine is a Sith. Despite his trust in the Chancellor, despite his fear of losong Padmé, Anakin still does the right thing. He goes to Mace Windu and informs him of Palpatine&#39;s true nature. He sacrifices what he believes may be his only chance to save his wife, and Windu benches him. Anakin is one of the Order&#39;s best warriors, he knows Palpatine better than any other Jedi, he is without doubt their best chance at successfully taking Palpatine into custody, and Windu tells him to stay put.<br><br>So, when the final confrontation comes, Anakin walks in to find that not only was he right, the Masters who went to arrest the Chancellor did need his help, but the only survivor of the attempt is about to murder the Head of State of the Galactic Republic in cold blood, in violation of the Jedi Code. The same Code that has tormented Anakin ever since he began his relationship with Padmé, seems to be worth nothing even to a member of the Jedi Council.<br>At this point, Anakin has lost what little faith he has left in the Jedi, and once Windu is dead, he has, in his mind, already gone too far to go back on serving Palpatine. The rest, as they say, is history.<br><br>There&#39;s a quote from Knights of the Old Republic that I think could pretty well serve as the thesis statement for all of Star Wars, &quot;Love doesn&#39;t lead to the dark side. Passion can lead to rage and fear, and can be controlled... but passion is not the same thing as love. Controlling your passions while being in love... that&#39;s what they should teach you to beware. But love itself will save you... not condemn you.&quot;<br>―Jolee Bindo<br><br>Fits pretty well, I think. Anakin fears losing Padmé, and his attempts to save her are what kill her. the Jedi fear that strong emotions will lead their members to the Dark Side, but their detachment only turns their members against them. Obi-Wan fears failing to teach Anakin, and his attempts to avoid that are what drive Anakin to Palpatine. The final act of the Original Trilogy is Luke overcoming his fear and anger to become a Jedi, and it&#39;s his father&#39;s love for him that saves him, and by extension, the galaxy.<br><br>Apologies if this a bit rambly and/or typo ridden, in a bit of rush at the moment, but I just couldn&#39;t help but chime in. What can I say, I&#39;m a Prequel fan at heart. </p>

            <p>Or at least, betrayed first.<br><br>I don&#39;t doubt for a second that the love between Anakin and Padmé was real.  I think Anakin knew, in his heart, that their relationship was good for both of them . . .<br><br>. . . And yet, his fellow Jedi are always talking about how love is bad, feelings are bad, getting attached to people is bad . . .<br><br>And when Padmé&#39;s life was threatened, at least in Anakin&#39;s dream-visions, and he feared for her safety, what help did he get from his Jedi teammates? <i>None</i>.  Let that person go.  Focus on upholding social and political order.  The system that Anakin had lived within since the age of ten gave him no help, no way to protect the one person he cared for the most.<br><br>It&#39;s not that Palpatine was so very charming or persuasive to Anakin.  It&#39;s that Palpatine was throwing Anakin literally the only rope, the only possible way out.  The Jedi betrayed Anakin first.<br><br>(At least in his mind.)<br><br>As for attacking the younglings, and later Padmé herself?  I&#39;ll admit, neither of those really follow from my reading.  It may be that the intense guilt Anakin felt from helping to kill Mace allowed Palpatine to further influence his mind in a way he hadn&#39;t been able to before.  Or maybe, even more darkly, finally throwing off the rigid tenets of the Jedi code from his moral being led Anakin to finally succumb to the desire for power he had already been entertaining before that point (and a desire that was already tied to his love for Padmé, wanting to be strong enough to protect her).  But due to the nature of the Force in that universe, the obsession with power finally corrupted his heart to the point that it eclipsed even the love that had originally fueled it.<br><br>—doctorlit, rather fond of the prequels</p>

            <p>Agreed, it&#39;s not that he wanted to fall to the dark side. He saw it as unavoidable if he were to save his love.  He realized, perhaps, that the Jedi had been utterly blind when Palpatine revealed himself.  He realized that he couldn&#39;t trust them anymore if they couldn&#39;t find a Sith lord right under their noses.  And then he tried to rationalize everything, to stick to doctrine, by reporting his findings to Windu.  And then he realized (with telepathic help from Sidious in the movie) that while he could be (relatively) certain of saving Amidala with the knowledge offered by Palpatine, according to the Chancellor himself at least, he feared that the Jedi would give him only condemnation and exile, because they&#39;d been so stubborn on attachment beforehand.<br>See, if I were Anakin I would&#39;ve fired up my lightsaber and lopped off Palpatine&#39;s head once he admitted he had lost the knowledge I so desperately needed.  It seems a more logical solution than sticking with him when he admits he can&#39;t deliver on his offer.  And then I would get the attention and validation from the council that I so desperately craved, by virtue of being the one to take down the Sith Lord.  Hell, maybe I could use my confirmed status as the Chosen One to bring about reforms that would let me stay with my wife, but that would probably be wishful thinking. But with the immediate crisis over, who knows? Maybe the foundation of the Order could be revisited...<br>Of course, then the original trilogy would be reduced to an AU....</p>

            <p>I believe the real message is the danger of trying to defy destiny. He ended up killing her himself and fulfilling his nightmares of her dying.  The novelization (which is excellent) implies that he thought she was in an affair with Obi-wan.  And also that he was so wrapped up in thinjing about himself that he didn&#39;t stop to think about her. Which, quoth the epilogue, is the real revenge of the Sith, for now himself is all he will ever have as he wakes up as Darth Vader.</p>

            <p>I found <i>Larklight</i> on a bookshelf in my classroom in... oh, say fourth grade? fifth? Probably round about then.<br><br>I don&#39;t remember much about it, but I distinctly remember it being... weird. Really distinctly weird.<br><br>-It&#39;s about two twins that live in a house that orbits the moon.<br><br>-They get a visit from &quot;Mr. Webster&quot; of the &quot;Royal Xenological Society,&quot; who is a giant white spider who&#39;s trying to kill them and take the house.<br><br>-The rest of the book features them attacking the giant spiders from beyond the solar system.<br><br>-There are moon moths that grab them when they escape the house.<br><br>-And alien pirates.<br><br>-Did I mention that this is all set in some weird steampunk 1700s-esque era where the British empire is a spacegoing power that travels through the Aether?<br><br>-Colonists to Venus got turned into trees by pollination, through some kind of disease.<br><br>It is trippy as all heck. Like, almost as much as Sharkboy and Lavagirl, but it feels a hell of a lot more well-developed. And it&#39;s so bizarrely memorable that I still remember it despite having probably not read or even seen it in almost a decade.</p>

            <p>So, like, what does &quot;I mean&quot; mean? This is only bugging me because both you and Twistey used the phrase in near proximity to each other. I use it myself.<br><br>But why? What does it signify? It&#39;s not literal, because declaring that you literally mean what you&#39;re about to say is redundant in most instances.<br><br>Is it ironic? Does it signify that you&#39;re about to say something you <i>don&#39;t</i> mean literally, or that the statement will require interpretation beyond the literal?<br><br>That seems to fit the two examples I&#39;m looking at. What Twistey actually means (I think) is that the <i>Star Wars</i> prequels are not considered very good, so looking for a sensible character motivation in them is, perhaps, a waste of time.<br><br>And what you actually mean (I think) is that if hS or anyone else really wanted to know what this thing is, it&#39;s possible to find that information rather than being silly and poking fun at it/you.<br><br>Did y&#39;all forget this is the PPC Posting Board?

            <p>You been talkin&#39; about me behind my back?! *intentionally exaggerated face of pretend anger*<br><br>Okay, so more seriously, although I didn&#39;t do so in my response to the Star Wars thing (I haven&#39;t seen enough of the prequels to do so), I feel that when faced with the absurd, finding logic is just a bit inferior to finding <i>their</i> logic (they being the person who did/made/etc the thing.) By that I mean psychology. While I understand that in some cases (such as Suethors, who we don&#39;t attack directly, or the perpetrators of serious incidents, who it&#39;s kind of pointless to analyze), it&#39;s not the best idea to try to figure out what they were thinking, using <i>our</i> logic won&#39;t always reveal the solution, because it&#39;s our logic, not theirs, and in some cases, we may be unintentionally assuming that others think the way we do.<br><br>-Twistey</p>

            <p>&quot;Hey! When&#39;s your birthday?&quot;<br><br>Agent Huinesoron yelped, his chair toppling backwards. Flinging out one arm, he caught at the edge of the table, giving himself just enough leverage to pivot the chair up onto one leg. He span, kicked down with both feet, and brought the seat back upright, facing the woman who had come up behind him.<br><br>Agent Kaitlyn gaped. &quot;That... was <i>seriously</i> impressive, you know that?&quot;<br><br>The elf scowled his best Noldorin scowl. &quot;You can&#39;t just sneak up behind people!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Wait.&quot; Kaitlyn held up a hand. &quot;I <i>snuck up</i> on you? What happened to &#39;you breathe so loud that they could shoot you in the dark&#39;?&quot;<br><br>&quot;That requires me to not be <i>eating</i>.&quot; Huinesoron flicked one foot against the floor, setting the chair spinning once more, and landed back facing the table. He sighed softly, then gestured at the next seat along. &quot;Please, sit.&quot;<br><br>Kaitlyn swung down into the chair and squirmed to get, if not comfortable, at least not in actual pain. &quot;Thanks. So when <i>is</i> your birthday?&quot;<br><br>Huinesoron shook his head slowly. &quot;You interrupt my first proper meal in days to ask <i>that</i>? I don&#39;t-&quot; He stopped, grimaced. &quot;Please, clarify your reason for me.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Well, at least you&#39;re trying,&quot; Kaitlyn murmured. &quot;I see a friend eating a thoroughly miserable salad with a face like a... moping... face...&quot; She waved a hand through the air. &quot;Forget the simile. Point is, I figured no-one remembering your birthday would be the most tragic reason for that, so I wanted to check and make sure.&quot;<br><br>Huinesoron&#39;s brow was deeply furrowed. &quot;I don&#39;t think I followed all of that.&quot;<br><br>Kaitlyn winked at him. &quot;That&#39;s what you get for trying to work in a foreign language,&quot; she said. &quot;So when&#39;s your birthday?&quot;<br><br>The elf carefully refrained from rolling his eyes. &quot;First of all,&quot; he said, &quot;elves don&#39;t celebrate birthdays - we celebrate the day of your begetting.&quot; Kaitlyn opened her mouth, a malicious twinkle in her eyes, and he hurried on. &quot;Secondly, I was born before the Moon or Sun first rose; we kept no count of the years in that time, nor is it simple to convert from days of the Sun to days of the Trees.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Hmm.&quot; Kaitlyn mulled this over. &quot;So you don&#39;t know when your birthday is?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I suppose not.&quot; Huinesoron picked up his fork, twirling it between his fingers. &quot;I fully expect to be called away soon, so if you don&#39;t mind, I&#39;ll eat while we talk-&quot;<br><br>&quot;No!&quot; Kaitlyn snatched the plate away with a look of disgust. &quot;You can&#39;t eat this! It&#39;s way too depressing-looking.&quot;<br><br>Huinesoron examined his salad, which consisted in large part of slightly wilted lettuce. &quot;I suppose,&quot; he allowed, &quot;but have you seen the purported meat in this place? I&#39;d rather my food didn&#39;t actively attack me.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Who said anything about meat?&quot; Kaitlyn asked, grinning. &quot;Have you seen the <i>mushrooms</i>? I think there must be a hobbit working in the kitchens; I&#39;ll get them to whip you up a special birthday-sized portion.&quot;<br><br>The elf blinked. &quot;But it&#39;s not my birthday.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Nah-uh!&quot; Kaitlyn swung an accusing finger towards him. &quot;You don&#39;t know that, you just got through <i>telling</i> me you don&#39;t know that. So it might be.&quot;<br><br>&quot;... fine.&quot; Huinesoron put down his fork and smiled politely at her. &quot;So I&#39;m familiar with mortal traditions - this means I get a present, yes?&quot;<br><br>Kaitlyn sniffed and tossed her hair. &quot;Only if one follows <i>human</i> customs,&quot; she said. &quot;Myself, I much prefer to take the Hobbittest path in all things - which means <i>you</i> owe <i>me</i> a present.&quot; She smirked, held out her hand towards him. &quot;Come on - don&#39;t be stingy, birthday boy; it only comes round once a year, after all!&quot;<br><br>~<br><br>^_^<br><br>(Technically speaking, this should be considered a <i>Driftwood</i> side-story.)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Mainly because it contained Middle-earth references, of course. And because it was cute and fluffy.<br><br>And, just for fun, my (very inaccurate) estimate of Agent hS’s age (assuming he actually lived all those years and didn’t fall through a plot hole from Middle-earth)<br><br>I have absolutely no idea how long he spent in Valinor. Two thousand years? I take it he did leave Middle-earth, so:<br><br>The LOTR wiki says that the First Age was approximately 590 years long, which is at least better than my last estimate.<br><br>The appendices inform me that the Second Age was 3441 years long and the Third Age was 3021 years long.<br><br>This is where we get into the whole “how long is there between the end of the Third Age and the present” thing. I don’t have much of an idea, so I’m going to say fifteen thousand years.<br><br>So that gives me (hopefully my mental arithmetic works) 2000+590+3441+3021+15000= (oh, stuff it, I’ll use a calculator) 24052, which I’ll round to <b>24000 years</b><br><br>How did I do?

            <p>(It&#39;s like the Age of the Dinosaurs: &quot;Never before... has life on Earth... been this pretty.&quot;)<br><br>What you&#39;ve got there is a pretty good estimate of Agent Dafydd&#39;s age: he lived through all of that stuff as Maglor. His age is actually going to be crucial to figuring out Agent Huinesoron&#39;s, so let&#39;s go over this piece by piece.<br><br>1/ How old were the Feanorian boys when the Trees died? Tolkien Gateway <a href="http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Timeline">handily</a> has a timeline of the Ages of the Trees, which tells us that Feanor was born in the adjusted Year of the Sun 11,201, and made the Silmarils in 13,894. Somewhere in that ~2600 years, his kids were born - but when?<br><br>There&#39;s several approaches to take here, but I&#39;m going to take the simplest: Maedhros and Fingon were friends, which suggests they&#39;re about the same age. The timeline has Fingon&#39;s siblings born in 12,457 and 13,051, which suggests Fingon might have been born around 12,000.<br><br>That actually seems a bit early: Finarfin hadn&#39;t even gotten married at that point, and Finrod acts like a contemporary of at least the middle Feanorions. So perhaps we should assume Aredhel was a late birth, and take the spacing of Finarfin&#39;s children, who were all born in that same period. Dividing that up gives us ~150 years between children, placing Fingon and Maedhros in 12,300 (just after Finarfin&#39;s wedding), and Maglor in 12,450.<br><br>The Sun and Moon rose in 14,373, so your estimate of 2000 years in Valinor is spot on for Maglor.<br><br>2/ How long is there between the end of the Third Age and the present day? Tolkien estimated 6000 years (I wonder which Archbishop of Armagh he got <i>that</i> from... ^_~) so let&#39;s just accept that. That puts <b>Dafydd&#39;s</b> age at 15,000 years, but a different Third-Age-to-Now number would change that.<br><br>3/ Why do I keep going on about Dafydd? Because of the interesting fact that Agent Huinesoron had a friend who was friends with Maglor. That means they&#39;re <i>about</i> the same age; hS is probably a little younger, let&#39;s call it 1800 years before the Sun rose.<br><br>4/ What happened next? For 455 years, hS lived in the cities of Finrod Felagund. And then... he died. Yes, there&#39;s a story to that; it&#39;s in an upcoming mission.<br><br>(Running age: 1800+455 = 2255 years.)<br><br>How long did he stay dead? We know that Finrod was released from Mandos before the end of the First Age, and Glorfindel by the middle of the Second, but they were very special cases. There&#39;s no indication that anyone else got out by the end of the Third Age - which is when the last of the renegade Noldor returned, which would be a good time to reconsider things. So let&#39;s guess at ~100 of the Fourth Age for hS&#39;s release.<br><br>We don&#39;t count time while dead in his age (... obviously?), so he picks up at 2255. He pokes around in Valinor for a bit, indulging his interest in geology and archaeology - but those disciplines are kind of pointless when you can just <i>ask</i> the people who lived there - and the Power who made the rocks in the first place. How long could you handle that - 200 years maybe?<br><br>And then he steals a boat and leaves.<br><br>(That&#39;s not quite as bad as it sounds - hS is half-Teleri, so he had a hand in <i>building</i> said boat. In fact, let&#39;s add 50 years for that &#39;interest&#39; to get him far enough for his plan to work.)<br><br>At age 2500, Huinesoron returns to Middle-earth. If we take Tolkien&#39;s figures, it&#39;s now ~3600 BC. Stonehenge has not yet been built, horses are on the verge of domestication in Russia, and what was once Middle-earth is about to enter the Bronze Age. It&#39;s about 400 years to the time of the Pharoahs. <br><br>Alternately, it&#39;s less than 130 years since the death of Eldarion of the Reunited Kingdom. Unless the New Shadow affair ended with the complete destruction of Numenorean civilisation, Minas Tirith should still be thriving. A quick speculation: maybe Gondor gets hit by a cataclysm around 350 years from now, wiping it from the map, and the survivors flee to northern Harad to become the First Dynasty of Egypt?<br><br>Anyway, that doesn&#39;t matter, for one simple reason: Huinesoron still uses Quenya as his preferred language. That&#39;s the act of someone whose most recent long residence was in Valinor, <i>not</i> someone who spent thousands of years watching mortal civilisation grow. I don&#39;t know <i>how</i> he wound up in HQ, but I estimate he did so within 100 years of landing on the Hither Shore.<br><br>Agent Huinesoron joined the PPC about 20 years ago (give or take 5). Adding everything together, his age comes to <b>2620</b>. That makes him <i>probably</i> older than our Time Lords, but I wouldn&#39;t be surprised to find an older active agent among the non-human population of HQ.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>...is that I&#39;m not sure I ever figured out exact ages for my Calaquendi agents, and now I&#39;m curious. I...*think* they&#39;re closer in age to Fëanor&#39;s kids than to Fëanor himself, but having never considered it, I don&#39;t actually know. To add to that, I don&#39;t even know for sure that they&#39;re the same age! It would make just as much sense for them to have an age gap!<br><br>Seems like an odd thing not to have figured out, in retrospect, but at least I/Lily did figure out roughly where they were when. That&#39;s something.<br><br>At any rate: in terms of age when in the PPC, they should be younger than Dafydd, whether or not they were born earlier, but possibly older than hS? They didn&#39;t die, but they also made it to the very end of the First Age and no further, IIRC. And that&#39;s the best I can do without taking a long look at both the timeline and my notes.<br><br>Still, of all the things not to know...<br><br>And, of course, happy birthday! To Neshomeh as well, should she happen to be reading this...May you have a wonderful year ahead!<br><br>~Z</p>

            <p>... an extra hundred years on hS in the First Age. He makes that back with his stuff in the Fourth, I think. So it does hinge on when they were born.<br><br>And there&#39;s other old agents, too! We have another copy of Maglor (Hawthorne), who comes from the First Age. It looks like Jacques is pre-2000-years-underground Jack Harkness, but don&#39;t we have other Harknesses?

            <p>The Guardsman. 4156 years old from a linear standpoint, not counting all the recursive timelines in the Time War. <br><br>I&#39;m not sure how old the Agent and the Disentangler are (besides &quot;old as balls&quot;), but they <i>were</i> the only Time Lords who weren&#39;t visibly affected by the de-aging potion in &quot;Gallifrey Shrinks&quot;... <br><br>As for nonhuman agents, I have that one defunct draenei agent—Arinellya in Bad Slash—who I really need to brush off and give a fresh coat of paint to sometime.

            <p>... just how many previous examples there are?<br><br>It&#39;s an interesting quirk of my writings that there are very few simple friendships between my agents. Mostly they&#39;re either partners/ex-partners, or related in some way. (This is a knock-on effect from the time period I thought I needed to get every single one of them married off.) It&#39;s quite refreshing to get to just write Agents hS and Kaitlyn running into each other and being... friends.<br><br>Article! Thank you! I&#39;ve been putting that off since forever, because I know it&#39;s going to be a nightmare to write. Maybe this will be the prompt to get me doing so. Thank you!<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>And only because <a href="http://starshadowhall.tripod.com/ppc/rc999/07i3ntyt.html">I wrote it</a>. But it would be funny if there were more. {= )<br><br>... You know, I think it might be pretty common to set up one&#39;s characters for pairing off and/or (possibly) having kids? I don&#39;t know why, but I see it all the time, and even I seem to be doing it fairly consistently, though less formally. Either there are relationships or there are pointedly <i>not</i> relationships. Must be a human thing?<br><br>You&#39;re welcome!<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I certainly <i>hope</i> it&#39;s a tradition. Though I assume part of the tradition is that a given writer can&#39;t do it more than once. (Otherwise, you understand, I will probably write a dozen more.)<br><br>Is it a human thing? I think it&#39;s probably a combination of two (well, three) things:<br><br>1/ A Human Thing. We&#39;ve got a culture which places immense value on romantic relationships, to the point where people who aren&#39;t in one get asked why. They&#39;re seen as the end-state for your closest friendship, so when your writing consists of your characters getting to know each other, there&#39;s a tendency to slide that way.<br><br>2/ which actually probably comes first: writers in relationships teeeeend to have difficulty keeping their characters from falling into them as well. There&#39;ve been a lot of couples in the PPC over the years, and some of them - Kaitlyn and I included - have written fairly prominent agents. It&#39;s not hard to imagine newer PPCers seeing at something that Should happen to their agents.<br><br>3/ which I think applies exclusively to me: some people just like making up family trees. ^_^<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Surprisingly, getting into the department without being seen had been easy. Jenni had her suspicions about this, but seeing as it had been too late to back out gracefully from the word go, she surrendered to the moment. Why not? It wasn&#39;t like this was some sort of premeditated, lust-fueled plot to get into his pants. It was an accident. A happy, raunchy accident between two happy, raunchy people. No harm, no foul, right? And Jack was the British image of a cocky, handsome American fly-boy. He was fun.<br><br>Of course, the Powers That Be couldn&#39;t simply let them get away with it. Oh, no. Upon exiting Room B-9, slightly disheveled and grinning, they ran smack into Head Nurse Suzine.<br><br>Suzine narrowed her eyes in immediate suspicion. &quot;Nurse Robinson...?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Uh-oh,&quot; said Jack. &quot;Are we in trouble?&quot;<br><br>Face frozen in its rictus, Jenni latched onto Jack&#39;s arm. &quot;I found him!&quot;<br><br>&quot;What?&quot; said Suzine.<br><br>&quot;What?&quot; laughed Jack.<br><br>&quot;Jack, you naughty boy,&quot; Jenni said, shaking a finger at him. &quot;You can&#39;t go wandering off like that! Come on, back to your room!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Um...&quot; said Jack.<br><br>Suzine crossed her arms and didn&#39;t budge. &quot;You... found him.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yes.&quot;<br><br>&quot;In Section B.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yes.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Wearing a cocktail dress.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Totally random happenstance,&quot; said Jenni, wishing she&#39;d gone with fewer sequins.<br><br>&quot;Hey, I&#39;m starting to feel a little sidelined here,&quot; said Jack.<br><br>Jenni made what she hoped came off as an apologetic grimace and not obvious guilt to both her date and her boss.<br><br>Suzine&#39;s skepticism was etched on her face like a stone carving. &quot;Riiight. Captain Harkness, why don&#39;t you come along with me? I think there&#39;s an immediate release form with your name on it.&quot;<br><br>She made a curt gesture. Jenni let go of Jack&#39;s arm, and he, having the sense not to piss off someone who could get away with wearing those heels with that skirt, shrugged and went along.<br><br>&quot;Nurse Robinson, I&#39;ll see you in the Kudzu&#39;s office in fifteen minutes,&quot; said the Head Nurse before turning away.<br><br>Jack looked over his shoulder, raised a hand with the thumb and pinky spread apart, and mouthed &quot;Call me!&quot;<br><br>Jenni waved. Once they&#39;d rounded the corner, she slumped off to Section C and her impending doom.<br><br>About twenty minutes later, she stood in front of the Kudzu Vine with Suzine glaring at her from the side.<br><br><i>And you say this was a case of mistaken identity?</i> said the Flower.<br><br>&quot;Yes, Ma&#39;am.&quot;<br><br><i>Why did you not say so and excuse yourself in the first place?</i><br><br>&quot;Embarrassment and stupidity, Ma&#39;am.&quot;<br><br><i>I see. And why did you not simply tell Nurse Suzine the truth right away?</i><br><br>&quot;Panic, Ma&#39;am.&quot;<br><br>The Kudzu rustled its many leaves, giving the impression of a disappointed sigh. <i>I thought you were more mature than that, Nurse Robinson.</i><br><br>Suzine gave a cough that sounded suspiciously like &quot;Yeah right.&quot;<br><br>Jenni pressed her lips together, but held her tongue.<br><br><i>Dear oh dear. What are we to do with you? Clearly No-Drool Videos will not be an effective remedy. Unless...</i> If it were possible for a vine to smirk, the Kudzu was doing it. <i>Perhaps, with your clear expertise in this area, you might be able to suggest some... </i>improvements<i> to the regimen?</i><br><br>Jenni winced. Ellipsis improvements. Dear oh dear indeed. &quot;You want me to come up with something so awful it will put off the likes of myself? That... seems pretty cruel. To everyone else.&quot;<br><br><i>Oh, don&#39;t think of it like that. Consider it a public service. A small contribution on your behalf for the sake of a PPC free of wanton lusting. We will have to mount a plaque on the wall to honor your dedication. Won&#39;t that be nice?</i><br><br>Jenni went *wibble*.<br><br><i>Then that settles it. You&#39;re dismissed. I know you&#39;ll want to get to work right away.</i><br><br>&quot;I hope it was worth it,&quot; said Suzine, who at least seemed somewhat taken aback herself.<br><br>Jenni muttered something incoherent and went to write her last will and testament.<br><br><hr>
<br>Disclaimer: I don&#39;t know Jack&#39;s character especially well. I hope I managed not to throw him OOC in just a few lines of dialogue. ^_^;<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I’m not into the superhero genre, but I liked this enough to keep reading, and thus I must report some faults that caught my eye.<br><br><i>The redhead couldn’t help but to laugh at that, her laughter combined with the other girl’s cry, attracted the attention of the area’s personnel, who proceeded to escort them out of the area.</i><br><br>You got a comma splice between the sentence ending with &quot;at that&quot; and the sentence starting with &quot;her laughter&quot;; since these are independent sentences, the comma should be either a period or a semicolon. <br><br>Also, the comma after &quot;cry&quot; doesn’t make sense standing alone (what would be the main clause and what would be the sub-clause there?). You may want to either drop the comma or insert another comma after &quot;her laughter&quot;, making &quot;combined with the other girl’s cry&quot; an insertion in the main clause &quot;her laughter attracted the attention of the area’s personnel&quot; (which is correctly separated from the dependent clause &quot;who proceeded to escort them out of the area&quot; by another comma).<br><br>Thirdly, I don’t like the repetition of &quot;area&quot; in this sentence, especially when the instances refer to different areas. The &quot;area’s personnel&quot; is obviously the Nursery personnel (but Kryptogirl, who is this sentence’s POV character, doesn’t know yet that this place is called &quot;Nursery&quot;?) while the area the girls are escorted out of appears to be a common room which is just a part of the Nursery-area just as well as the sleeping chambers they are escorted to. If you want to avoid the term &quot;Nursery&quot; here (although it was already used elsewhere), replacing the second instance of &quot;area&quot; by something more specific would help to clarify that the girls are not escorted out of the area’s personnel’s domain.<br><br><br><i>A few moments later, they found themselves in their designated sleeping <b>chambers</b>.</i><br>Since they are obviously in the same chamber, I don’t see why the plural form should be used here.<br><br><i>She found her bed rather quickly, took the temporary cardboard ID and <b>tore into pieces</b>, finishing with slumping on the bed and <b>curling into fetal position</b>, still sobbing.</i><br>Shouldn’t this be &quot;tore <b>it</b> into pieces&quot; and &quot;curling into <b>a</b> fetal position&quot;?<br><br><br>Apparently Kryptogirl <i>was</i> given a name on arrival in the PPC; she just doesn’t like it and thus tries to ignore the fact when she pretends that she doesn’t have a name. From the disclaimer, I conclude that she’ll change it later. *checking the wiki* Yep. *going to read the other interludes*<br><br>HG</p>

            <p>Graham Linehan, who you may remember as the sack of depressed luncheon meat who wrote parts of a good show called Father Ted twenty years ago, is a ghastly TERFy moron. In the run-up to Christmas, he heard about how the charity Mermaids (a support organization for trans youth) was getting a grant from the Big Lottery Fund and got a bunch of equally TERFy morons on MumsNet (because of course) to bombard the Big Lottery Fund with thousands of badly-spelled form letters expressing dubious and non-specific &quot;concern&quot; until the Fund put the grant under review.<br><br>This, the astute among you might have realized, is not good news.<br><br>Harry Brewis, known better around the internet as HBomberguy, is a leftist YouTuber who streams sometimes. During an episode on why speedrunning is awesome, he said that he&#39;d stream Donkey Kong 64 and beat it 100%, with a donation button for charity (yet to be chosen when the video was recorded) running while the stream was up. After seeing Graham Linehan&#39;s latest bit of manufactured outrage, he elected to give the proceeds of the stream to Mermaids.<br><br>I should mention here that Donkey Kong 64 is a collectathon made by Rare, and that therefore attempting a 100% completion run (actually 101%, because even Rare knew their games were complete BS sometimes) is, to put it mildly, an act of outright self-harm. One of the listed requirements for a player to submit their 101% complete speedrun to speedrun.com is that <i>they must literally hate themselves</i>. Harris took it further. You see, you don&#39;t actually have to get <i>all</i> the collectibles to get a 101% completion run in DK64. Harris set out to collect literally everything - all the bananas, all the battle crowns, all the ancillary guff you can think of, in an almost non-stop stream. His initial donation goal was $500. He thought that&#39;d be a pretty good goal, given how his streams tend to be very small affairs. He did not get $500.<br><br>After appearances from people like Chelsea Manning, Owen Jones, John Romero, Mara Wilson, and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and with the stream retweeted by everyone from Lindsay Ellis to <i>Cher</i>, Harris finally finished his 57-hour ordeal this morning.<br><br>The final donation count, raised by an unbelievable number of people, was...<br><br>Well, it&#39;s best if I just show you:-<br><br><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Dxa9tpBXgAI9izV.jpg:large"></p>

            <p>Like, this is not new information; the whole forum&#39;s full of posts &quot;debating&quot; trans rights, most of which are an excuse for handwringing about how they&#39;re the ones who are <i>really</i> being oppressed by trans women doing unspeakable things, such ask them not to be exclusionary towards trans people, or exist.

            <p>Did you know there&#39;s at least one PPCer who frequents Mumsnet? You might want to consider how responding to &#39;looks like you&#39;re accidentally using a broad brush&#39; with &#39;no, it&#39;s full of that&#39; is going to feel for them.<br><br>~<br><br>Thank you for the article; I think it:<br><br>1/ Suffers a bit from trying to group a lot of loosely-connected details into a single narrative stream. The timeframe under discussion jumps around quite a lot, though by a weird coincidence three of the four actual years named are &#39;2000&#39;.<br><br>2/ Does a strangely lackluster job of discussing harassment and assault against trans people, which I know from other sources can only be describes as a vile flood of abuse right now. I think it only mentions &#39;who are themselves disproportionately vulnerable to violence&#39; once, whereas there are repeated mentions of the idea of trans women as a source of violence. My guess is I&#39;m either misreading the purpose of the article slightly, or The Outline works from the assumption that said vulnerability is going to be at the top of its readers&#39; minds anyway.<br><br>3/ Highlights well, though through a strange mix of naming names, naming groups, and vaguely pointing at loose assemblages, that horribly large numbers of people behave <i>awfully</i> to and about people who don&#39;t slot neatly into the old-fashioned sex-gender binary. That&#39;s a terribly indictment on society and I wish it would go away.<br><br>4/ Seems to presuppose acceptance of the idea that sex is subordinate to gender. The phrase &#39;gender segregated hospital wards&#39; is clanging quite hard against my skull: due to the way legal terminology has been changed, it&#39;s probably true at the moment, but they were pretty clearly originally sex-segregated (if a 1950s nurse had discovered that their patient was what would now be recognised as a trans woman, I&#39;m positive they&#39;d have transferred them to a different ward).<br><br>&#39;Gender segregated hospital wards&#39; is an idea that makes absolutely <i>no</i> sense to me; &#39;sex segregated hospital wards&#39;, given some of the stories Kaitlyn has told me about elderly patients, I can see some logic in.<br><br>5/ Is a showcase of hyperbole from both the article - it compares Mumsnet to 4Chan, which is laughable <i>whatever</i> you&#39;re comparing to 4Chan - but far more so from the people it&#39;s discussing. Claiming to &#39;debunk&#39; what&#39;s basically someone&#39;s personality - or saying that you can get &#39;rigorous testing by someone in a lab coat&#39; for it - is utterly ludicrous, and pretending that society doesn&#39;t (stupidly) treat men and women differently is not just wrong, it shows a dangerous disregard for experiences outside your (not your-your, obviously) own.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Today when I popped over to the wiki, I noticed a banner at the top of the page announcing that they&#39;re migrating us over to fandom.com as part of their rebranding process, which began last year. This shouldn&#39;t affect us very much, if at all—wikia.com links will redirect to fandom.com, so nothing will break, and if anything, Fandom expects a general uptick in activity due to how Google works. However, those of us with websites and whatnot to maintain should be prepared to edit any wiki links we have, and of course the Nameless Admin will need to correct the links at the top of the Board.<br><br>I&#39;m not sure what the Renaming of the Gods is going to do to the religion of Wechi, but I&#39;m sure it will sort itself out. {= )<br><br><a href="https://community.wikia.com/wiki/Help:Fandom_domain_migration">More information about the migration here</a>.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>... I really do like the sense of limitless bizarre possibilities.

            <p>I have a Google doc full of free-to-use D&amp;D characters, and they include:<br><br>- A tiefling who was found and raised as an elf by a desperate noble to try and give him a claim to an empty throne. While she was accepted as the rightful ruler at first, the plan eventually failed, and now she&#39;s on the run from people who want to kill her.<br>- A half-elf who is actually a cat, turned by magic into the daughter of an elven-and-human couple who desperately wanted a child but couldn&#39;t seem to ever successfully have one. If she dies, she&#39;ll reincarnate somewhere (because nine lives), but she still has to grow up before she can be in her previous state again. (I haven&#39;t yet checked that ability against the game and what&#39;s reasonable, though.)<br>- My OC leader of the Talons of Tiamat, who is a scary little halfling woman. Wow, unexpectedness.<br><br>I&#39;m also working on an attempt at a homebrew campaign, with the help of my more experienced friends. It has a few NPCs in it that are kind of similar &quot;this&#39;d require some figuring out how it works, but it&#39;s entirely plausible so yay&quot; in terms of abilities.<br><br>-Twistey</p>

            <p>How so? Well, let&#39;s use clerics as an example:-<br><br><i>The young elf boy watches in awe as the beat begins, elders of his faith moving and swaying in time with the instruments. The air thrums with the power of their god, and before he knows it - and before his father can stop him - he hurls himself headlong into the dance, flowing like wind in branches to the glory of the divine. And as he dances, the whole forest dances with him, pulsing with divine magic and the blessing of a benevolent summer.<br>---<br>Torches flicker overhead as the moaning of wounded shield-dwarves fills the makeshift field hospital in the tunnels. The old dwarf, whose beard is so long it&#39;s tied to his belt like a bullwhip, scuttles to and fro, fingers dancing as he sutures wounds and lays on gentle hands. Suddenly, a noise from the hallway. The goblin horde is coming. The old dwarf uncurls his beard and hefts it in his hand, the weighted end heavy with spikes. Let them come.<br>---<br>The guards never suspected a thing. Clambering up the walls, she hops over them and clings to the curtain wall of the black fortress. It&#39;s taken her days to find this place, and she can&#39;t blow her chance now. The rest of her abbey has been taken by a horror from beyond death, and Avandra guides her every step. Sheer walls, locked doors, undead guards, none halt her progress. At last she breaks into the vampire&#39;s chamber, draws her old school fencing rapier, and charges.</i></p>

            <p>Closest, that is, to something I can justify as a version of Kaitlyn.<br><br>My theory is that she&#39;s weaponised being unobtrusive, kind of like a prettier-looking Igor. She&#39;s very helpful, very quiet - and when you need her, she&#39;s just <i>there</i>, without seeming to move between places. A sort of combination nimble fingers, rapid movement, and intuitive stealth (at least until she fails her roll...!).<br><br>That fits with the costume and personality, so I think she&#39;s set!

            <p>So, it turns out there is a Feat in DnD 3rd Edition, in some obscure supplemental book, that allows you to change your characters spellcasting stat at character creation.  Any magical class can use it, and you can make any stat into your new spellcasting stat.  The idea is that your character comes from a non-traditional spellcasting tradition.<br><br>Knowing that, I made up some interesting spellcasters.<br><br>Ograth, Half-Orc Bard (Str-caster).  Ograth casts spells by hitting things really hard.  If you see him on the battlefield, he&#39;s got a war drum slung over his shoulder.  If you meet him in a bar, he might make due pounding tankards against a table.  Either way, his drumming stokes a fire in the belly.<br><br>Verith, Elf Druid (Dex-caster).  The song of nature is so powerfully beautiful that Verith can&#39;t help but move along with it.  She dances through the forest and the forest dances along with her.  Trees sway, deer cavort, birds wheel and dip.  On the rare occasion that she gets angry, her whirling and leaping summons storms to enact nature&#39;s vengeance.<br><br>Shale Earthblood, Dwarf Sorceror (Con-caster).  Shale could always feel the magic inside him.  It coursed through his veins from a young age, and all he had to do was find a way to let it out.  His village didn&#39;t take kindly to blood magic, and he was exiled.  Now he wanders the tunnels; white scars gleaming nearly as much as his silver knife.  (For this character, every spell requires 1 hit point of intentional damage per spell level to cast.)<br><br><br>In the worlds of fiction, some of these already exist.  The Clave from The Second Chronicles of Thomas Covenant use blood magic similar to Shale&#39;s.  In the Deathgate Cycle, the Sartan use dance as a major component of their spellcasting.<br><br>-Phobos</p>

            <p>I definitely think that it has some potential for creating unique characters like the ones you made (not sure how well Shale would work though. That&#39;s a lot of damage for an already low hitpoint class). But it also would allow for some kinda ridiculous combinations, like a fighter who multiclasses to wizard and casts with strength.</p>

There have been some good times, and some bad times, but overall it&#39;s been pretty cool to be a part of the community that I grew up reading stories from, and it would be both difficult and ridiculous to deny that I&#39;ve benefited greatly from being here.

            <p>Have some of my latest creation: Poe Slaw! It&#39;s not real coleslaw, but rather a parody of it - it&#39;s made of sugary foods. Like, the cabbage is taffy, and the mayonnaise is marshmallow sauce. It&#39;s also got a little bit of that Swiss Bleepolate you gave me melted down and mixed in, because another function of Poe Slaw is to put suggestions in your mind that maybe, just maybe, a badfic you just read is a trollfic, thus relieving you.

            <p>But first, a technicality. Since everybody can follow the link and read the story, you published an unbetaed mission. We don’t do this, unless we’re quite confident that we don’t need a beta, and only few of us can get away with that.<br><br>When you ask for betas, you should <i>not</i> link the story, but you should give us some hints, like word worlds involved or &quot;no canon knowledge required&quot;, so that we can determine whether we feel qualified to do the beta reading. You should then wait until volunteers tell you their e-mail address and then send them the link to the story.<br><br>HG</p>

            <p>But we very much prefer you to get one. More about editing the wiki <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/PPC_Wiki">here</a>, under &quot;Helping Out&quot;. Creating a wiki account also gives you a user page (User:YourUsername) where you may tell something about yourself, so that we can look you up if we don’t remember what you told us already.<br><br>Aaaand I forgot one selfish thing. It would be nice to credit your beta readers near the disclaimer or in an author’s note at the end of the story.

            <p>The only things that I have to say are that your characters seem really unperturbed to be in this crazy situation, they could probably show more reaction and emotion, or at least Bradbury could. I also wouldn&#39;t use text from the fic in the middle of your sentences, it&#39;s a bit jarring and confusing. Also, just out of curiosity, is Bradbury a reference to Ray Bradbury?</p>

            <p>1)I&#39;ll explain more about Bradbury and Gibb&#39;s previous exposure to the bizarre in later works. <br><br>2)The text-in-fic thing is standard PPC formatting for showing stuff like notable misspellings.<br><br>3)Yes.</p>
