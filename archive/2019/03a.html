            <p>I&#39;m working on my Permission attempt, and have completed the &quot;find a badfic you want to spork (so you can start your first mission right after you get Permission)&quot; step. I found this Creepypasta badfic that&#39;s a blantant wish fulfillment/murder fantasy, and includes Slender&#39;s Mansion (a mistake common enough to be considered fanon, but still wrong) which is why I relegated it to my DOGA agents-to-be, Amber and Miriam. Currently I&#39;m in the process of reading through it and assessing how I would spork it. But I ran into some questions.<br><br>1. So, as a few of you know, Amber and Miriam have supernatural powers. Would they be able to use these to take out the reader Stu? By this I mean: would they be able to use them on any mission no matter what, or would it depend on the universe, and if it does, would Creepypasta count as a universe where they are allowed to do this?<br><br>2. Speaking of the reader Stu, I&#39;m still a bit confused as to how one takes out a Sue-possessed Crash Dummy. Do you kill it like a regular Sue, or is it more like a possession that requires an exorcism?<br><br>Hope to get these clarified soon. Thanks,<br><br>-Twistey</p>

<li>It would depend on the universe. One of my agents is a Pokémon, for example, but since he&#39;s got to fit the world he goes into missions for, he doesn&#39;t normally get to keep his powers. When he does, it&#39;s for a continuum where someone flinging around electricity wouldn&#39;t be unheard of.<br><br>2. You kill it like a regular Sue, though DoSAT requests the agents keep the dummy as intact as possible (no throwing the thing into a pit of lava, for example). Once the Sue&#39;s been killed, the dummy reverts back to its normal state, though it&#39;ll probably have a few more stab wounds than it started with.</li>

<li>I&#39;m thinking that Creepypasta is a universe where supernatural powers are a thing, even if you only count the famous &quot;canon&quot; characters. So okay then.<br><br>2. Okay. So maybe cutting off the reader Stu&#39;s head symbolically (because he cuts the heads off of all the DJs at the parties he attacks) wouldn&#39;t work. Good to know.<br><br>-Twistey</li>

            <p>Perhaps this was shoved down too fast by exiting stuff going on further up-thread and nobody even looks here? Maybe you did it wrong and everybody assumes that you don’t need a response here because somebody else already commented on the linked GDoc? (*checking* Nobody did.) Or they talked to you on the discord and I didn’t notice?<br><br>Formality: While presenting agent concepts for general discussion is okay, you shouldn’t link your GDoc when asking for beta readers. Since everybody who follows the link can read it, you published an un-betaed version of your permission request. We don’t do that because having your mistakes pointed out more privately is less embarrassing and some beta readers may be too polite to be totally honest when they know that everybody can see their comments. You should have omitted the link, waited for volunteers who usually would tell your their e-mail address, and then mailed the link to them.<br><br>You not knowing this, and me barely knowing who you are, may be indicators that you are not ready to ask for permission. (But then, I’m never on the discord and didn’t pay much attention to the Board lately, so other Permission Givers may easily recognize you.) <br><br>Anyway, next steps: You respond to the comments I left on the GDoc and tell me when you finished editing (preferably by mail, my address with more or less usual substitutions to ward off the spam bots can be found on my <a href="https://ppc.fandom.com/wiki/User%3AHieronymus_Graubart">wiki user page</a>); then I’ll read it again to catch new mistakes and what I may have missed on the first read. <br><br>HG</p>

            <p>The reason why we don&#39;t know each other is because I spend more time on Discord than on the Board, but I&#39;ve been around for a few months, and I thought it was time to start trying for Permission. I did reply in e-mail, but I&#39;ve also conferred with Calliope, my other beta, and I corrected the text based on the suggestions you two had made. Thanks again for your help!</p>

Any gender is fine, though be aware that I&#39;m emotionally sensitive and probably won&#39;t be okay with being yelled at, scolded, or worse.<br><br>One last thing: If you want to get really literal, you can also write me as a Skarmory whose armor plating has a silvery sheen. Be aware though that in this guise I won&#39;t be comfortable with being paired with a human, so if you choose to use my Pokemon self, I must humbly request for my partner to be of avian form, preferably in the Flying egg group.<br><br>Have fun!</p>

            <p>Hi. I&#39;m Twistey.

            <p>Okay, so after I opted in, I talked to Willis about my opt-in and learned that he found it uncomfortable for me to be shipped with anyone but him. At first I objected, but then I was like, &quot;y&#39;know, this is his first Shipfest, I can understand why he feels that way.&quot; And I decided I could honor that. So *talking off to the side* hey Moon, you might as well just write us down as a single entry in the list because we&#39;re only shippable with each other, *talking at the camera again* and I&#39;ll just be content to await the cute Twistey X Willis fics and ship other people. :D<br><br>And no, you can&#39;t ship me with Willis and someone else simultaneously. Past experience tells me that he finds the idea of a third person being introduced into the relationship to be creepy.<br><br>Finally, try to keep it light and wholesome. For example, if you&#39;re doing a supernatural beings AU, make it more along the lines of &quot;Twistey is a guardian angel assigned to Willis/Fem!Willis&quot; rather than &quot;Willis/Fem!Willis is the dangerous demon boyfriend/girlfriend&quot;. Catch my drift? This is once again to keep things from getting uncomfortable.<br><br><b>These restrictions may sound like no fun at all, and like I&#39;m just coddling my boyfriend, but the bright side to them is that you don&#39;t have to spend time and energy thinking about who to pair me with, and a premise could come easily. If this is your first Shipfest, why not pick this pairing so that you have an easy way to get started?</b><br><br>Happy shipping.<br><br>-Twistey</p>

            <p>...clarifying a few things:<br><br>- The &quot;Willis/Fem!Willis&quot; thing wasn&#39;t intended as a ship, it was just a reminder that either option could be used. But I think you knew that...<br>- I can&#39;t personally wrap my head around multiple Willises existing at once, let alone being in a relationship with all of them. I also can&#39;t wrap my head around the same for multiple of me, or being in a relationship with a version of myself.<br>- Less relevant: I&#39;m also trying to figure out just how separate &quot;Crazy Fire Power Twistey&quot; is from, er, &quot;regular me.&quot; She&#39;s separate from my actual self in real life, obviously, but I consider her somewhat joined with my Internet self. I think? I wouldn&#39;t depict myself with fire powers on Newgrounds, but I do so on a consistent basis on the Board. Sort of my &quot;Board self&quot;, I guess? Somehow she&#39;s also tied to Intern Twistey from MoaM, because that&#39;s how she got her fire powers, but she&#39;s also separate from MoaM because MoaM is meant to be treated as even less real than the fictional continua we deal with, out of deference to people like Thoth and Nesh who were a little uncomfy with the fic. Am I making any sense?<br><br>TL;DR: Depending on what Willis says, I&#39;d like you to tell me where you want to go with this before I approve or deny this.<br><br>-Twistey</p>

            <p>But now that you&#39;ve got me thinking about it, something like this:<br><br><i>Twistey and Willis were engaged in some triumphant canoodling when there was a burst of flame, and two people materialised in the room. One seemed fairly ordinary - a young man with a mop of blond hair and a scrappy attempt at a beard. The other was a girl who looked like something out of an anime - probably one of the more risque Magical Girl &#39;verses.<br><br>Twistey stared at them, spluttering. &quot;What - but - who are you?!&quot;<br><br>&quot;You know perfectly well who we are,&quot; the second of the newcomers replied. &quot;We&#39;re you. Obviously.&quot;<br><br>&quot;And we&#39;re not happy,&quot; the young man put in. &quot;Here you are, masterminding all this &#39;shipping-&quot;<br><br>&quot;And doing a great job of it,&quot; his companion put in, &quot;even if I do say so myself.&quot;<br><br>&quot;- and you <i>didn&#39;t invite us</i>?&quot; The young man looked deeply hurt. &quot;I&#39;m starting to think you don&#39;t love me any more, Twistey.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yeah,&quot; his friend agreed. &quot;Or me.&quot;<br><br>Twistey&#39;s eyes threatened to bulge right out of her head, but Willis was surprisingly calm about it all...</i><br><br>And so on and so on.<br><br>I&#39;m pretty sure multiple people in this thread have been shipped with not-even-altered versions of themselves, so pairing you with Little Miss Firestarter is simplicity itself. ^_~<br><br>hS</p>

Probably the main things to bear in mind (if you want any accuracy at all, that is) are that I&#39;m not very tall, and wear glasses but can get around without them if I have to (mentioned mainly because I remember past shipping of everyone with glasses, actually, so why not?).<br><br>And I think that&#39;s it.

            <p>Against my better judgment (also known by the name Anxiety), I&#39;m opting in.<br><br>17, heterosexual female, 5&#39;6&quot;. Naturally pale as shpx, but thanks to a tan/getting sunburnt only look slightly whiter than Default Caucasian. I&#39;ve got a rectangle-y body shape and broad shoulders. My hair goes down to my shoulder blades in a thick, curly, dirty-blonde mess, and my eyes are a dull blue but can appear green in certain lighting. Depending on the day, I&#39;m either in jeans and a T or pajamas/similarly comfy clothes. I have fairly plain semi-rimless glasses that are photosensitive, though I can see mostly-fine without them and occasionally forget to put them on in the morning.<br><br>So long as it&#39;s SFW, I don&#39;t particularly mind anything.

            <p>On the basis that nobody really knows <i>me</i>, a run-down of my personality:<br><br>I&#39;m fairly antisocial, due to a combination of being introverted and social anxiety. I tend to keep my thoughts to myself, which can be quite acerbic, but when I do talk I&#39;m usually either being blunt and speaking without thinking or over-thinking something and then flubbing what I&#39;d actually wanted to say. Still, I try to be nice when I can be. My anxiety presents itself in my being incredibly uncomfortable in unfamiliar situations, and being unwilling to approach others on the basis that I don&#39;t want to bother them. And when I get excited (which basically whenever I get involved with any activity/media I love), I love to share it with others.<br><br>...I&#39;m gonna stop myself there, because if I go any further I&#39;m gonna want to write a full essay on the interconnected train wreck that is me, and I&#39;m already afraid Ive gone into egotistical territory with this much.</p>

(And, because I am lazy, to copy and edit my description from two years ago with minor edits because nothing ever changes with me.)<br><br>Eighteen years of age, brown hair (shoulderish-length and growing), black-and-purple eyeglasses over green or hazel eyes. I can usually be found in jeans and a tee, plus a jacket of some kind and either tennis shoes or boots, depending on the weather. Or heels. Apparently I&#39;m unusual in that I actually don&#39;t find them ungodsly uncomfortable, even stiletto boots. And since it bears mentioning - still a girl. Usually. I really, really don&#39;t mind that being changed, though.<br><br>Now, then! For ships.<br><br>As has been mentioned, I am presently dating Moons. It would be wonderful to see what you people can cook up for the two of us! On the other hand, I couldn&#39;t care much less who else you decide to ship me with - Granz and Thoth are the obvious candidates, of course (can you say Floof Trio?), but I&#39;m sure you can find other ways to get creative. Especially if you decide to throw me into a group situation. The only solid limit I can think of is to keep it healthy - even if that means a certain someone doing a redux of The Healthiest Ship.<br><br>Of course, I might think of other things to add later, and I&#39;ll post those accordingly. But I doubt it. Cheers!</p>

            <p>It might be useful for this festival to know that I... really don&#39;t like being kissed. It won&#39;t be a <i>problem</i> to write it, because I do kiss people and I don&#39;t just hate all kisses, but it&#39;s one of those things I get really weird about sometimes. A relic of a string of unwanted relationships. So if you wanna be realistic to me, if you&#39;re writing me in any sort of emotionally-not-great state, I will be averse to lip-smooches. Cheeks and foreheads are absolutely fine though.<br><br>Of course, you can also feel free to disregard this and write me making disgusting kissing noises with anyone and everyone. That won&#39;t be a problem. Just thought I&#39;d put it out there.</p>

            <p>Desc:  19 year old white male with some stubble,shortish brown hair, brown eyes with a hint of grey to them. Tall, somewhat stocky, but decently strong. Definitely built for endurance over speed. Red scar on back of left hand. Wears glasses with rectangular lenses. Favors khaki cargo pants and t-shirts, occasionally a grey polo shirt if I feel like being more formal. Male pronouns, heterosexual (as far as I know), [Although last Shipfest that didn&#39;t matter so much when the Primarch ships set sail].  Enjoys cuddling with close friends as a demonstration of trust and love, whether platonic or otherwise.  I also tend to compartmentalize my more romantic/sexual/softer side to the point where I end up coming across as incredibly stoic or introverted. Also I hate making eye contact for more than a moment or two at a time. Also-also, I&#39;m semi-secretly a hopeless romantic in some ways and cling stubbornly to the ideas of true love.  Basically, I&#39;d rather hold hands with the love of my life than sleep with someone else.<br><br>Here comes the part where I&#39;d note my limits, but seeing as the two Boarders I&#39;d rather not be shipped with aren&#39;t really around much, there&#39;s no point other than to announce my proposals for the following ships:<br><br>THOTH/GRANZ<br>CALLIOPE/FOUR MOONS WATCHING [canon]<br>GEEMA/LIZARDS<br>THOTH/LIZARDS<br>GEEMA/THOTH/LIZARDS [Because why not]<br><br>I&#39;ll append more in replies if I think of any others.<br><br></p>

            <p>I&#39;m opting in!<br><br>Most people around here call me Moons. I&#39;m 5&#39;5&quot; and pretty much skin and bones. Cis female, 16 but looks younger. I have fluffy, light brown, shoulderblade-length hair and green eyes that sometimes decide to be blue. I tend to be in pajamas a lot of the time, but when I&#39;m actually dressed I wear a lot of dark colors, especially navy blue (though not much black). I like dresses, but tend to wear jeans and t-shirts most of the time out of practicality. I have glasses, though I can see decently well without them. I have a Sharpie tattoo on the inside of my left wrist ( a semicolon with the name TAYA written under it in all caps) and make a point of not covering it up. I&#39;m usually wearing novelty socks and a couple of necklaces (pentacle pendant and blue lace agate chips). I usually wear a light blue sweater with a fish-shaped button and an olive green shoulder cape with a Celtic knot clasp. They&#39;re both knit, and like most of the other knitwear I own, are heirlooms from my late mother.<br><br>I&#39;m demisexual and lesbian. Dating Cal, but feel free to pair me with any of the girls who opt in. I&#39;m also okay with mixed-gender groups IF Cal is also in them. I don&#39;t want too much of an age gap, but I&#39;m willing to have my age changed to get around that.<br><br>Keep it SF4M and don&#39;t hurt anyone too badly and you should be good.<br><br>I&#39;m a mom friend and will do anything for cuddles. I&#39;ve also got a clustershpx in place of my mental health, and a bit of a tragic backstory, so if you want to play around with that for hurt/comfort go ahead.<br><br>My ships are the canon ones (hS/Kaitlyn, Nesh/Phobos, Ix/Aegis, me/Cal), the Cal/Granz/Thoth/those people group, Si/Alleb (the ones who manage to somehow be pure), Maslab/Foxbot, Scape/corsets, and GMA/badfic.</p>

            <p>Here&#39;s a couple of tips from a veteran.<br><br>1) Don&#39;t reveal your teams tactics early. Thanks for telling us what sort of moves you&#39;re going for, it makes it easier to work out how to counter your team. <br><br>2) Look at your team and think of common weakness that at least 2 of your Pokemon share (for example Charizard, Arcanine, Gyarados and Dragonite are all weak to Rock) do you really want over half your team weak to the same type?<br><br><br></p>

            <p>I&#39;ve got to admit, I have spent hours since this post went up trying to think up a new team to play this year.

The unbeatable MAMOSWINE!<br>Second. You know it, you hate it. He&#39;ll wash you up. It&#39;s ROTOM-W!<br>Thirdly, this one will sweep you under once again. It&#39;s ALAKAZAM!<br>Next up, a new face, a new force. KARTANA!<br>Fifth to step up will have you hot under the collar. That&#39;s right, HEATRAN is here to stay!<br>Reminding you not to mess with Fairies, a new &#39;mon is here. It&#39;s MEGA ALTARIA!<br>And finally, the Snowy Substitute you&#39;d best not mess with.

            <p>It&#39;s <i>so good</i>, you guys. {= D<br><br>Phobos and I went to see it last night, and despite two agents variously being complete basket-cases and/or shouting commentary in the back of my head, I really enjoyed the heck out of it.<br><br>First of all, it&#39;s <i>gorgeous</i>. The textures are fantastically detailed, the environments look astonishingly real, you can see the wind blow through every bit of fur lining and the light catch every bit of the peach fuzz on Hiccup&#39;s face. This is not distracting, because it&#39;s freaking perfect. Also, they&#39;ve used a low angle (human eye-height, I think) for a lot of scenes that puts you right in the middle of the action and gives you a real sense of just how big the dragons are. They&#39;re big! So big! It&#39;s amazing!<br><br>New dragons: cool! I wasn&#39;t too sure about the design of the new female Fury—bit <i>too</i> smooth, a little Uncanny Valley, alien-like, next to Toothless. I didn&#39;t like it as a female Night Fury. However, they make it pretty clear she&#39;s not exactly a <i>Night</i> Fury; she&#39;s a subspecies, and in that context, the differences sit more easily. She&#39;s beautiful in motion, too. Definitely grew on me. (And her courtship with Toothless reminded me of Farilan and Ilraen, so that&#39;s a fun intangible. ^_^ )<br><br>New bad guy: terrifying! He&#39;s basically the anti-Hiccup. He&#39;s smart, he knows dragons, and he&#39;s completely ruthless. Where Drago from the last film was a bit too over-the-top to be taken seriously, Grimmel is reserved, cold, and calculating, yet not humorless. He&#39;s playing a game, and he knows the rules better than our heroes. Gave me the creeps every time he was on screen. He&#39;s a great villain.<br><br>Soundtrack: well done! It weaves new and unique themes with callbacks to the first two films in a way that feels both fresh and connected, and when you do hear the original theme, it&#39;s a wonderful payoff.<br><br>Plot: no big surprises, but solid. It does what it sets out to do, and does it well. It provides a bittersweet and satisfying end to the story, and I give the creators huge props for having the guts to do that instead of milking the franchise until it gets stupid. They&#39;ve had a great run between the three films, the series, games, and whatever else. There might still be plans for adjunct materials that I don&#39;t know about (toys forever probably?), but to have the main story be brought to a respectful close is a great treat.<br><br>Lore: they show us how to make fireproof stuff out of shed dragon scales (they do shed!) and saliva. Gall has a new line of merchandise for sale. Hope you like blue.<br><br>How do my characters feel about it?<br><br>Well, Derik frankly didn&#39;t take much of it on board. The whole premise of &quot;if you love them, let them go&quot; in this context is so alien to him that I think his brain more or less shut down in self-defense from the word go. A handkerchief or two were no doubt completely ruined. He stuck it out for his partner, though. Good for him.<br><br>Gall is convinced that putting Hiccup in charge of Berk was the worst idea in the world (she has a point), and would have liked to tell him everything he was doing wrong and how she&#39;d have handled things instead (much worse). She is definitely never going back to her home continuum, and they can take Fellrazer away from her over her dead body.<br><br>She and Derik agreed on this. Some uncharacteristically sedate cuddling ensued.<br><br><s>At least until Gall&#39;s water broke because wouldn&#39;t that just be the worst?</s><br><br>{= 3<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>My instinct whenever I see a trailer for it is to jump out of my seat and practically scream, &quot;You spent two whole movies milking that &#39;last of his kind&#39; arc and now you&#39;re getting rid of it for a Generic Love Story!&#39;&quot;<br><br>That&#39;s not to say that stories that have the same basic plot as a ton of other stories can&#39;t be good; if it were, then a lot of fantastic works would never have been made.

            <p>I&#39;m a huge fan of the Lord of the Rings movie trilogy, and I&#39;m reading my way through the books for the first time. And it just hit me for the hundredth time how beautifully crafted and complex this world is, with so much mythology and history and enduring characters that we can love so much. It&#39;s not perfect, of course, but it is a truly amazing piece of fiction in both formats (in my opinion). And the PPC basically introduced me to Tolkien back when I&#39;d read the Original Series, so I&#39;m doubly emotional over both right now.<br>Anyway, I thought we could have a little Tolkien Appreciation here on the board - tell me your favorite book/character/scene/quote/piece of trivia/anything you fancy? Or perhaps let&#39;s share some Tolkien goodfics, to shine a light upon the sea of badfic. Anything goes, basically, as long as we fangirl/boy/person about Arda together.</p>

            <p>It was /incredibly/ commom for bad fanfics to show Gimli as a buffoon, Boromir as plain evil, and Merry and Pippin as interchangeable idiots. Partly I think it stems from the popularity of Legolas, and Gimli coming off the worse in their various confrontations.<br><br>But mostly it comes from &quot;Nobody tosses a dwarf!&quot;<br><br>hS</p>

It explains both why he isn&#39;t a king (his ancestors lost their kingdom) and why he could become one (the Gondorian king went missing). It lets you introduce the Nazgul as a sort of hereditary enemy (the Witch-King is directly responsible for the fall of Arnor and the death of the last king of Gondor), which means you can use them as a threat during the series. Plus, &#39;army from the frozen north led by an undead sorcerer&#39; has a certain... resonance with another big-budget fantasy series. ^_~<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Soooo, theorycrafting. I seem to recall them saying they were going to make 5 seasons, which seemed weirdly specific at the time, but makes sense if there&#39;s a specific storyline they want to follow. For instance:<br><br><i>Middle-earth: Numenor</i><br><br>Welcome to the Second Age. You won&#39;t be leaving it until the last episode of Season 5.<br><br><i>S1: The Mariner&#39;s Wife - Aldarion &amp; Erendis (800s)</i><br><br>The only nearly-complete story of Numenor before its fall, this is an easy place to start your series. It&#39;s relatively contained - you can pay fleeting visits to Middle-earth with Aldarion, but mostly remain in Numenor - and lets you pull a lot of the political side of things. If you play it right, you can also start building in future conflicts by introducing Gil-Galad and company.<br><br><i>S2: Forging the Rings/Tal-Elmar (1500s)</i><br><br>AKA The Annatar Season. Runs from his first appearance to the forging of the One, slowly building the threat of Mordor (you can definitely turn the first use of that name, and the name Sauron, into a key moment). Alongside this, we have the settling of Middle-earth by Numenor, including a narrative inspired by Tolkien&#39;s aborted tale of a Middle-earth native meeting the Kings from Over the Sea.<br><br><i>S3: The War of the Elves &amp; Sauron/The Shadow over Numenor (1600s)</i><br><br>Interleaving the war - including the founding of Imladris - with the first touch of the Shadow on Numenor. The Numenoreans become crueler, and though ultimately they drive out the Darker advisors and sail to the aid of Middle-earth, the stage is set for later stories. Late in the season, three of the Numenorean exiles are gifted Rings by Sauron...<br><br><i>S4: Akallabeth (3200s)</i><br><br>A <b>big</b> time jump, which takes us to the tail end of Tar-Palantir&#39;s reign. This season runs at breakneck speed, covering Pharazon&#39;s takeover, his conquest of Sauron, Sauron&#39;s conversion of Numenor, the assault on Valinor, <i>and</i> the escape of Elendil &amp; co. It&#39;s a fun one, and it ends with the Downfall.<br><br><i>S5: The Last Alliance (3400s)</i><br><br>How do you follow that? All-out war, obviously. Spend a couple of episodes building Arnor and Gondor, then witness Sauron&#39;s return and forge the Last Alliance. The war takes twelve years in canon, so there&#39;s room for plenty of material. Let me put it like this: Sauron announced his return by razing Minas Ithil and laying a three-year siege of Gondor, which was only broken when the Elves finally arrived. There&#39;s a lot to play with.<br><br>And yes, you get to end by entering the Third Age, showing Isildur&#39;s claiming of the One Ring, and basically meeting the prologue of the films. That leaves the door wide open for several follow-up seasons, including the Fall of Arnor &amp; Gondor, the founding of Rohan, and, yes, potentially Young Aragorn as season 8.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Look, I was that into Tolkien. I read it, but it went over my head. I was probably too young? I&#39;m not sure. Maybe I&#39;ll go back and still won&#39;t like it. <br><br>But man, I am in awe of the guy. Middle Earth is a kind of insanely well-developed setting and I genuinely do understand WHY there is such a fandom for it. It&#39;s utterly fantastic.<br><br>Anyways, the one thing I DID get into was Tolkien Fanfic. However, I only know the classics that anyone already invested in the PPC or Tolkien fandom is already aware of. So, allow me to proselytize to you young&#39;uns... who are my age. I am also a young&#39;un. <br><br>-OFUM. The Official Fanfiction University of Middle-Earth was funny then, and it&#39;s still funny now. It&#39;s a wonderful snapshot of the manic spirit of the PPC/fandom Back In The Day, and I love it so much for all of its insane goofiness.<br><br>-Suedom. I&#39;m going to disagree with the authors here, and tell you that Suedom is pretty great. Yes, it&#39;s goofy and weird in places, but it&#39;s also amazing, and probably the single darkest and bleakest thing to ever be written in the PPC setting, while still being funny in places. And frankly, the tinge of darkness makes it really interesting and special and just that much more <i>real</i> than anything else of its era. If the PPC is a lighthearted workplace comedy, Suedom is the adjacent grim look into a hostage situation. <br><br>It could also be considered subversive, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s <i>quite</i> as subversive as the authors might think: the PPC (well, now at least) is generally more broad-minded then we&#39;re painted. Although I don&#39;t think we&#39;ve recruited a lesser Sue in a while... maybe we should bring that tradition back.<br><br>-Finally, if you haven&#39;t... you need to read Mostly Harmless. It takes the &quot;girl sucked into Middle Earth&quot; trope, subverts it, and then proceeds to do <i>everything with that subversion you could conceivably do</i>. There is nothing left to do now, because Mostly Harmless has done it all already, and done it better than you will. Yes, that was a joke, but it is legitimately that good.</p>

            <p>My favourite scene in LotR is and always will remain the coming of the Rohirrim to Minas Tirith. RotK-M made a valiant effort, but it really didn&#39;t do it justice.<br><br>My favourite thing about Tolkien&#39;s writing is the sheer <i>depth</i> there is under it. Middle-earth always feels like a world that we&#39;re only seeing a small part of. In contrast, something like <i>Harry Potter</i> or even <i>Discworld</i> feels much more like a soundstage or a theatre set - yes, there are background details, but they feel like they exist in isolation, not as part of a coherent whole.<br><br>One way this manifests is in how even the smallest characters have a whole lot going on. Take, for example, Rosie Cotton, pretty much a textbook example of a featureless love interest. Except...<br><br><i>‘Hullo, Sam!’ said Rosie. ‘Where’ve you been? They said you were dead; but I’ve been expecting you since the Spring. You haven’t hurried have you?’<br><br>...<br><br>‘Well, be off with you!’ said Rosie. ‘If you’ve been looking after Mr. Frodo all this while, what d’you want to leave him for, as soon as things look dangerous?’</i><br><br>That&#39;s practically all the lines she gets, but in just that much, Tolkien paints an entire character for us. You could <i>write</i> Rosie Cotton, as a living character in her own land, and be sure you had her pretty much as Tolkien intended, entirely on the basis of that quote. And I think that&#39;s pretty fantastic.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>The world of Tolkien is so rich and vast, and so perfectly put together, that it&#39;s simply breathtaking. For a Tolkien newbie like me, there is always something new to discover - some other fascinating detail to fit into the puzzle.<br>My favorite scene from the books - so far, at least - is anything involving the Ents. In the movie not so much, but the way the Ents are described in TTT, and the sheer power of their last march, impressed me a lot. From the movie scenes, though, nothing will ever compare in my eyes to Boromir&#39;s last stand. I would say he&#39;s my favorite, but it&#39;s so damn hard to choose when there&#39;s also Aragorn and the hobbits and Gimli and Éowyn and all the others. Which yet again points out the sheer richness of this world.</p>

            <p>Hi. Okay, so it says on the Wiki that the Shipfest fics all take place in the Shipverse, where Luxury is from. The Shipverse is described in its own wiki page as basically everyone acting all hypersexual like Luxury is.<br><br>But in the Shipfest, we are strictly reminded to keep things PG, otherwise it&#39;d get weird. This is obviously contradictory to what&#39;s above, or at least I&#39;d like to think it&#39;s contradictory, because even though one could argue that we&#39;re not describing everything that happens in the Shipverse, there remains the lack of comfort in the idea of banging everyone I get shipped with for Shipfest.<br><br>We really need to rethink this...<br><br>-Twistey</p>

            <p>... the PPC is an exaggerated version of World One. PPC agents work for a soulless corporation whose bosses literally don&#39;t care if they go insane and/or die; they never get paid, never get holidays, and - oh yeah - their job is literal murder. Which isn&#39;t an <i>entirely</i> accurate depiction of our world.<br><br>So why would the Shipverse PPC be any different? To my mind, Shipverse World One is probably pretty similar to our own, except that where our sexual orientation spectrum has a hard skew to &#39;straight&#39;, theirs is balanced about &#39;bi/pan&#39; - and where our history and institutions have ingrained monogamy into our society, theirs are much looser.<br><br>If you&#39;re only shipped with people in a friendly/cuddly way, then that&#39;s all Shipverse Twistey gets up to. If she was <i>Agent</i> Shipverse Twistey, we&#39;d assume she was indeed &#39;banging everyone&#39;, but she&#39;s not, so we don&#39;t. Similar to how we assume all agents are psychotic obsessive fans, but Boarders are probably just the obsessive part. ;)<br><br>(yes I have thought about what the Worlds One would be like across the multiverse I&#39;m not weird you&#39;re weird)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>TBH, the Shipfest weirded me out the first couple times, too, but then I realized an important thing: it has next to nothing to do with my real self. It&#39;s just a spoof with a gossamer-thin connection to my username and not much else; the more unsubstantiated and goofy, the better. Done correctly, no one would ever look at a Shipfest fic and go &quot;Yeah, that is totally something that is based on heart-truth about X.&quot; It doesn&#39;t <i>mean</i> anything. It&#39;s just for lulz. {= )<br><br>That&#39;s why I think it&#39;s silly to put any effort into getting the details right.

            <p>I mean, just look at the main PPC &quot;canon.&quot; If two people bump into each other in Headquarters and each pulls out a compass, chances are that they won&#39;t agree on which way North is. If the Shipverse is an AU of the PPC, then it makes sense that we would care even less about the specifics; in the end, what matters is how funny it is, and there&#39;s tons of room for humor without having anyone so much as hold hands.</p>

            <p>GMA maneuvered his car up a windy, dusty mountain road, a bag full of books in his trunk next to the groceries. He eventually reached a remote cave that, oddly enough, had a power line running into it. In fact, the cave seemed lived-in: there was a pair of maxlboxes and a painted-on address by right-hand side of the entrance.<br><br>GMA got out of the car and grabbed the sack of books he’d bought down in town from the trunk. “Hey Doc!” he shouted into the cave as he walked in.<br><br>“Did you bring more booksssss?” a voice growled from the depths.<br><br>“Sure did!” GMA yelled back.He started walking down the slope into the main part of the cave. As he made his way to the large main chamber of his cave, he walked past his apartment, which was just a pile of side chambers with a door labeled ‘B’ blocking the front. GMA liked his place. Sure, it was pretty out of the way, but it was spacious, cheap (even though the rent was in a rather unusual currency), and Doc was a <em>very</em> good friend.<br><br>After entering the cave, he froze. The big black dragon who lived in apartment A was still sometimes intimidating, even though he knew full well that doctorlit was a very nice guy. He just happened to be a dragon. An extremely handsome (and kinda cute) nerdy dragon who liked books.<br><br>GMA snapped out of it, took the bag of books, opened it, and set it on the ground in front of him. Doc stepped forward a few times, and started sniffing at the rent.<br><br>“Yesssss,” he said, “booksssss. Fresh booksssss. Wonderful bookssssss.”<br><br>“I got a whole bunch of stuff,” GMA said.<br><br>“Yesssssss,” Doc hissed. “My pressssious bookssssses.”<br><br>“You’re doing the Gollum thing again, doc.”<br><br>Doc shook his head. “Yes, but booksssss. I needs them. Mine. Mine!” He grabbed the bag with a very hand-like claw and pulled it with him deep into the cave<br><br>GMA sighed. “Do you want to snuggle up and read later?” he called into the inner depths of the cave.<br><br>“Booksssss!” the dragon replied. Doc evidently wasn’t in the mood.<br><br>“Ok, maybe tomorrow then.” GMA replied as he went home.<br><br>“Bookssss.” came a faint reply from the depths of the cave. “Booksssss.”<br><br>&quot;Never change, Doc,&quot; GMA said quietly, &quot;Never change.&quot;</p>

            <p>Wake Me Up Inside (Ship web around Moons, parody)<br><br><i>This is a parody of the fic “Like a Shadow Over the Soul”. It features Four Moons Watching as the main character, and also includes Calliope, twistedwindowpane, Iximaz, Huinesoron, Neshomeh, Scapegrace, Snowblaze, Willis64, and Hardric.</i><br><br>Hi my name is Luna Artemis’ia Selene Aysel Watch and I have long blue black hair (that’s how I got my name) with blue streaks and purple tips that reaches my mid-back and icy blue silver eyes like the moon and a lot of people tell me I look like Amy Lee (AN: if u don’t know who she is get da heck out of here!). [[I’m not related to anyone from Overwatch but I wish I was because Halloween Mercy is a major freaking hottie. I’m a fallen angel but my wings are retractable and made of energy. I have pale white skin. I’m also a writer, and I’m in a writing group called the PPC in England where I’m in my first year (I’m sixteen). I’m a goth (in case you couldn’t tell) and I wear mostly black. I love Hot Topic and I buy all my clothes from there. For example today I was wearing a black corset with matching lace around it and a black galaxy print miniskirt, silver fishnets and black combat boots. I was wearing black lipstick, white foundation, black eyeliner and blue eye shadow. I was walking outside Hogwarts. It was snowing and raining so the sky was very dark, which I was very happy about. A lot of preps stared at me. I stuck out my tongue at them.<br><br>“Hey Luna!” shouted a voice. I looked up. It was…. Calliope!<br><br>“What’s up Calliope?” I asked.<br><br>“Nothing.” she said shyly.<br><br>But then, I heard my friends call me and I had to go away.<br><br>------<br><br>The next day I woke up in my bedroom. It was snowing and raining again. I opened the door of my coffin and drank some holy wine from a bottle I had. My coffin was black ebony and inside it was blue velvet with silver lace on the ends. I got out of my coffin and took of my giant Valravn t-shirt which I used for pajamas. Instead, I put on a black leather dress, a pentagram necklace, combat boots and black fishnets on. I put on a pair of earrings in my pierced ears, and put my hair in a kind of messy bun.<br><br>My friend, Adelyn (AN: Twistey dis is u!) woke up then and grinned at me. She flipped her long waist-length raven black hair with red streaks and opened her forest-green eyes. She put on her Burzum t-shirt with a black jacket, black mini, fishnets and high-heeled combat boots. We put on our makeup (black lipstick white foundation and black eyeliner.)<br><br>“OMG, I saw you talking to Calliope yesterday!” she said excitedly.<br><br>“Yeah? So?” I said, blushing.<br><br>“Do you like Calliope?” she asked as we went out of our private messaging and into the Board hall.<br><br>“No I so don’t!” I shouted.<br><br>“Yeah right!” she exclaimed. Just then, Calliope walked up to me.<br><br>“Hi.” she said.<br><br>“Hi.” I replied flirtily.<br><br>------<br><br>Calliope leaned in extra-close and I looked into her gothic red eyes (she was wearing color contacts) which revealed so much depressing sorrow and evilness and then suddenly I didn’t feel mad anymore.<br><br>And then…………… suddenly just as I Calliope kissed me passionately. Calliope climbed on top of me and we started to cuddle keenly against a tree. Very cleanly because Shipfest fics are clean.<br><br>“WHAT IN ERU’S NAME ARE YOU DOING YOU FOOLS!”<br><br>It was…………………………………………………….Huinsorenian!<br><br>------<br><br>“Why did you do such a thing, you mediocre dunces?” asked Professor McShoma.<br><br>“How dare you?” demanded Professor Scape.<br><br>And then Calliope shrieked. “BECAUSE I LOVE HER!”<br><br>-------<br><br>The next day I woke up in my coffin. I put on a black miniskirt that was all ripped around the end and a matching top with silver moons all over it and high heeled boots that were black. I put on two pairs of moon and star earrings, and two angel-wings in my ears. I spray-painted my hair with silver.<br><br>In the Great Hall, I ate some Count Chocula cereal with holy wine instead of milk, and a glass of red wine. Suddenly someone bumped into me. All the wine spilled over my top.<br><br>“Watch where you’re going!” I shouted angrily. I regretted saying it when I looked up cause I was looking into the pale white face of a goth with spiky black hair with green streaks in it. They were wearing so much eyeliner that I was going down their face and they were wearing black lipstick. They didn’t have sunglasses anymore and now they were wearing red contact lenses just like Calliope’s and there was no scar on their forhead anymore. They had a manly stubble on their chin. They had a sexy English accent. They looked exactly like Joel Madden. They were so attractive that my body went all hot when I saw them.<br><br>“I’m so sorry.” they said in a shy voice.<br><br>“That’s all right. What’s your name?” I questioned.<br><br>“My name’s Iximaz, although most people call me Werewolf these days.” they grumbled.<br><br>“Why?” I exclaimed.<br><br>“Because I love the light of the full moon.” they giggled.<br><br>“Well, I am a fallen angel of the moon.” I confessed.<br><br>“Really?” they whimpered.<br><br>“Yeah.” I roared.<br><br>We sat down to talk for a while. Then Calliope came up behind me and told me she had a surprise for me so I went away with her.<br><br>------<br><br>My friend E’ternal Winter Night smiled at me understatedly. She flipped her long waste-length gothic black hair and opened her crimson eyes like communism that she was wearing contact lenses on. She had pale white skin that she was wearing white makeup on. Snowblaze was kidnapped when she was born. Her real parents are angels and one of them is a witch but a Mary Sue killed her mother and her father disappeared because he was depressed about it. She still has nightmares about it and she is very haunted and depressed. It also turns out her real last name is Night and not Blazkowicz.<br><br>------<br><br>I was really scared about Strakit all day. I was even upset went to rehearsals with my gothic metal band Fallen Gothic Wings 666. I am the lead singer of it and I play guitar. People say that we sound like a cross between GC, Slipknot and MCR. The other people in the band are E’ternal Winter, Werewolf, Calliope, Willis64 (although we call him Wilhelm666 now. He has black hair now with red streaks in it.) and Hadric. Only today Calliope and Werewolf were depressed so they weren’t coming and we wrote songs instead. I knew Calliope was probably punching a wall (she wouldn’t die because she was a vampire and the only way you can kill a vampire is with a c-r-o-s-s (there’s no way I’m writing that) or a steak) and Werewolf was probably watching a depressing movie like The Corpse Bride. I put on a short black leather shirt and tiny matching miniskirt that said Elvin’s Tales on the butt. You might think I have bad fashion sense but I really don’t.<br><br>------<br><br><i>Yes, that was several excerpts from “My Immortal”, with a few of the words replaced. Congratulations, you’ve read the laziest Shipfest fic ever. Apologies for the length, since I just couldn’t choose one or two scenes.

            <p>This is the first piece of writing I’ve posted to the Board, so hooray! The story is that Twistey and I do a double date with Moons and Iximaz playing dodgeball against Sues and Stues. I hope you guys enjoy it, feel free to make spinoffs!<br><br><br>“I’ve almost got it…” said Twistey as she delicately lowered the final card onto her house of cards.<br><br>“Surprise!” exclaimed Willis, tickling Twistey and causing the house of cards to fall.<br><br>“Nooo! I spent like ten minutes on that!” yelled Twistey as she swatted him on the arm.<br><br>“Hehehe, I’m so evil. Anyway, are you ready to go? The others are waiting.”<br><br>“Oh I suppose. Why did I agree to this again?”<br><br>“Because dodgeball is fun! Besides, the Sues and Stus are only simulations, and considerably weakened ones at that.”<br><br>“So where are we playing it? You never really told me.”<br><br>“Well, the Sunflower Official had a Sue themed sports arena built in Headquarters with the latest and greatest simulation technology, in order to trick agents into using their free time in training. But the agents became so overworked that it’s never been used, so we’ll be the only ones there.”<br><br>“Huh. Well, let’s get it over with.” Twistey said as she walked with Willis out into the hall where Moons and Iximaz were waiting, arm in arm.<br><br>“Woohoo let’s do this! The simulation room is 5 minutes of walking thataway!” said Iximaz.<br><br>“Race you there!” yelled Willis as he took off running, his cross country training coming in handy again.<br><br>“Well he can have fun with that.” said Moons as she walked around the corner and drove a golf cart, borrowed from the arena, around the corner. Everyone boarded it and easily passed Willis.<br><br>“Wait, come back! That’s not fair!” cried Willis, breaking into a sprint in a vain effort to catch up to them.<br><br>“HAHAHA FASTER!” yelled Twistey in a maniacal voice, tauntingly waving at the receding figure of Willis.<br><br>Willis managed to reach the room after a couple of minutes, in a sweaty mess, while the others comfortably lounged in the waiting room.<br><br>“Oh, look who showed up! I guess we can finally start.” said Moons, punching in the code to start the dodgeball simulation.<br><br>“Wait, let me catch my breath!” panted Willis, but to no avail. The floor fell from beneath their feet, dropping them into a huge room with padded walls, two huge piles of dodgeballs, a dividing line, and a horde of twenty Sues and Stus.<br><br>The Sues and Stus roared and charged toward their pile of dodgeballs, but the four friends took a while to get their head in the game.<br><br>“Oh crap crap crap crap! I’ve gotta hide!” screamed Twistey. She tried to run, but Willis grabbed her hand and dragged her towards the balls.<br><br>“Come on, this is the fun part!” Willis grabbed a pair of dodgeballs and forced one into Twistey’s hands. <br><br>“Now throw the dang thing! They disappear on a hit, but it takes 5 for us to get knocked out!”<br><br>“AAHH NO! I don’t want to get knocked out! That’d hurt!” screamed Twistey, right as a ball bounced off of her head.<br><br>“Snrk that’s one hit. And it&#39;s not literally getting knocked out.” said Willis. They both looked over at the other team to see one of the Stus triumphantly yelling and doing a Fortnite dance.<br><br>“That one’s mine!” snarled Twistey as she threw her ball at the Stu, causing him to blink out of existence. Satisfied that Twistey would fight, Willis looked for an opponent. And there he was. A buff elf. He looked like Dwayne Johnson with pointy ears, and much paler.<br><br>“ELVES AREN’T SUPPOSED TO BE BUFF!”  screamed Willis. The violation of nature turned toward him with a sadistic grin.<br><br>“Y’know, he’s right! We should get rid of this impostor! He’s such a fake, he’s not cool like us!” murmured some of the Sues and Stus. Five of them turned toward the buff elf, quickly wiping the smirk off his face. It took just 3 seconds for them to finish him off, but it gave Willis the breather he needed. He glanced over to see that Twistey had finished her opponent and had gotten another couple down too. <br><br>“OWOOOOOO!” Iximaz howled at the ceiling as he transformed into his wolf form, which must have been from Headquarters’s temporal strangeness causing a spontaneous full moon. He started bounding after the balls, wanting to play fetch, but soon suffered his fifth hit. With that, a hatch opened in the floor beneath him and he vanished from sight.<br><br>“Nooo!” yelled Moons, and everybody redoubled their efforts. They soon finished off the rest of their not very skilled opponents, but they each had no more than a couple of hits left.<br><br>“Yay, we did it! But what happens now?” exclaimed Twistey. And then the floor fell from beneath them, dropping them into a sleek plastic slide that somehow deposited them back down into the simulation waiting room. Iximaz, still a wolf, jumped up from where he had been laying and bounded over to Moons.<br><br>“Oh who’s a good wolfy! We won!” gushed Moons, affectionately ruffling Iximaz’s fur.<br><br>“Woof woof!” Iximaz barked excitedly as he leaned against Moons’s leg.<br><br>“We won! That was so much fun!” cried Twistey, flinging herself into Willis’s arms and giving him a kiss. <br><br>“We did! I knew you’d have fun!” said Willis as he happily embraced Twistey.<br><br>“Well, I’m exhausted. Let’s go relax.” said Moons. They all climbed back into the golf cart, including Willis this time, and headed off for a relaxing evening.<br></p>

            <p>&quot;Excuse me, may I take this seat?&quot;<br><br>Willis looked up to see a tall man (very tall, even compared to Willis himself) with black hair  looming over him. &quot;Er,&quot; he said, quite reasonably. He shook himself, looking down at the chair. &quot;My g- my partner&#39;s sitting there,&quot; he said. &quot;Sorry.&quot;<br><br>&quot;It&#39;s no problem; I will stand.&quot; The tall man executed a slight bow, and his hair shifted to show off the leaflike tips of his ears. &quot;I am Agent Huinesoron of DOGA, and I have a- what&#39;s that delightful phrase? Ah - a &#39;bone to pick&#39; with you.&quot;<br><br>Willis scooted his chair back a little, eyes wide. &quot;Is, is this a shipping thing?&quot; he asked. &quot;Because Twistey and I, we-&quot;<br><br>&quot;No, no,&quot; the elf - he was clearly an elf - assured him. &quot;But then again... yes.&quot; Agent Huinesoron folded his arms and fixed Willis with a Look. &quot;It has come to my attention that you have asserted that elves &#39;aren&#39;t supposed&#39; to be buff.&quot;<br><br>&quot;<i>Er</i>?!&quot; Of all the things Willis had thought he might hear, that hadn&#39;t even been on the list. &quot;But - I mean - you&#39;re <i>not</i>, right?&quot; He looked up at Agent Huinesoron, who did indeed meet the usual profile of a slender, graceful elf. &quot;You&#39;re not!&quot;<br><br>&quot;<i>I</i> am not,&quot; Agent Huinesoron agreed. &quot;And personally, I agree with you that it&#39;s not a particularly good <i>look</i> for us.&quot; He smiled - not the kind of cruel grin Willis had been fearing, but a genuine fond smile at some memory. &quot;I mean, if Legolas was all muscle-bound - can you imagine? <i>Ew.</i>&quot;<br><br>&quot;Er?&quot; Willis winced: he really needed to stop sounding like someone with the least interesting catchphrase in history. &quot;Then what&#39;s the problem?&quot;<br><br>&quot;The <i>problem</i> is that my preferences don&#39;t really enter into it,&quot; Agent Huinesoron said. &quot;We fought in a war, you know, against hordes of Orcs unnumberable by mortal Man. With <i>yeni</i> of training behind them, you&#39;d best believe our warriors had more muscles than they knew what to do with.&quot;<br><br>Willis clamped down on another <i>er</i>, but that left him with nothing else to say. He stared at the elf, thinking frantically, but was saved by an arm snaking around him from behind, and a kiss planted on the top of his head.<br><br>&quot;Hey, handsome,&quot; Twistey said, swinging down into her seat and smiling at Willis before shooting a glance at Agent Huinesoron. &quot;You making new friends?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I&#39;m not really sure.&quot; Willis reached across the table and took Twistey&#39;s hand, clinging to it like a lifeline. &quot;I&#39;m not sure <i>what&#39;s</i> going on.&quot;<br><br>The elf reached up to tug one of his braids and shrugged. &quot;I&#39;ve said what I needed to,&quot; he said, then winced slightly. &quot;And, ah, I hope I didn&#39;t... intimidate you?&quot;<br><br>&quot;A little,&quot; Willis admitted, then had to smile at the sheer guilt that flickered across Agent Huinesoron&#39;s face. &quot;But not much,&quot; he said. &quot;I&#39;m just a bit on edge.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Aren&#39;t we all?&quot; Twistey murmured, squeezing his hand reassuringly. &quot;So you&#39;re leaving, then? Only we&#39;ve got food on the way.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Er,&quot; and Willis couldn&#39;t contain his chuckle as the elf used his apparent catchphrase, &quot;yes. I&#39;m sorry for... yes.&quot; With another slight bow, Agent Huinesoron turned and hurried away.<br><br>Twistey huffed a sigh of relief and turned her attention to Willis. &quot;<i>Well</i>. What was that all about?&quot;<br><br>Willis shook his head slowly. &quot;Twistey, I don&#39;t think you&#39;d believe me if I told you...&quot;<br><br>~<br><br>(Actually I&#39;m pretty sure Tolkien never said, but Agent Huinesoron demanded to be allowed to express himself, and you <i>were</i> already in HQ...)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>In a funny coincidence, I was just reading about him to check my memory that he (most likely) would be grey-eyed in the bookverse. The wikis aren&#39;t terribly helpful about that, but they DO have <a href="http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Legolas#Description_and_Equipment">a general physical description</a> of him that Tolkien apparently wrote in protest to portrayals of him as &quot;pretty&quot; or &quot;ladylike.&quot;<br><br>I hadn&#39;t seen that before; it&#39;s interesting! It does seem to suggest that elven bodies wouldn&#39;t be inclined to get all swole since they can already be &quot;immensely strong&quot; while also being &quot;lithe,&quot; but OTOH, it&#39;s all relative, isn&#39;t it? For an elf, a swimmer&#39;s physique might be considered totally ripped. {= )<br><br>In other news, Agent hS is adorable and I want to give him a hug for doing a good job. ^_^<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>That description actually brings home the fact that the elves, and the Eldar in particular, would have been <i>deeply weird</i> to our eyes. We all know that elves were tall, but &#39;tall as a young tree&#39;? The Noldor <i>averaged</i> seven feet, which means the tallest of them could have two feet or more on a tall human. Mix that with &#39;lithe&#39; and slender, and you end up having to imagine people who look almost <i>stretched</i> - and who are, despite that, immensely strong (I don&#39;t know how strong your arms would have to be to shoot down a Fell Beast with a single arrow from the ground, but <i>yikes</i>) and almost impervious to harm. If you or I ran around mountainsides in only &#39;light shoes&#39;, we&#39;d end up with bruises and even cuts. Legolas didn&#39;t even notice.<br><br>And don&#39;t even get me started on Legolas&#39; proven ability to walk over deep snow without sinking! It seems like Tom  Loback&#39;s <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Drawings_by_Tom_Loback#/media/File:E%C3%B6l_and_Aredhel.jpg">creepy alien elves</a> may not be too far off the mark after all.<br><br>(For what it&#39;s worth, I can&#39;t think of <i>any</i> elf who was described as anything other than grey-eyed. Tolkien liked grey eyes.)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Not that version, but <a href="http://greenbooks.theonering.net/guest/files/081503_02.html">the more sciencey one</a> which jumps from watching the Riders of Rohan to astronomy:<br><br><i>Traditionally, the limits of human visual acuity are tested with a pair of stars, Mizar and Alcor, a double-star system in the constellation of the Big Dipper. The Arabs, who gave the stars the names we conventionally use, called these stars the &#39;horse and rider&#39;. It is possible - just - for a keen-sighted person to resolve Alcor and Mizar as two separate stars of unequal brightness, rather than as a single star. Alcor and Mizar are separated by 12 minutes of arc, so this stands as the limit of human naked-eye resolution. Objects closer together than this will only ever be seen as a blur. When you turn your telescope on the problem, it turns out that Mizar (as distinct from Alcor) is itself a double-star. The two stars are separated by 14 seconds of arc, well within the abilities of Legolas, if not Aragorn.<br><br>This comparison gives us an impression of how the world was seen through the eyes of the Elves. Aragorn at his most acute would only ever have seen Alcor and Mizar as a double-star, but Legolas would easily have seen it as a naked-eye *triple* star (Alcor, and the two doubles that make up Mizar), an object unknown to human sight. The starry sky was of great significance to the Elves, and no wonder - they would have seen far more in it than human beings ever could.</i><br><br>Elves. Is. Weird.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>A Badger bent over a piece of parchment, scribbling furiously as the candles burned low. <br><br>The parchment itself was a map. The badger was muttering furiously to himself about terrain. To his left was an index of mathematical calculations covered in notes, scribbles, and calculations; &quot;wind resistance&quot; this and &quot;magma formation&quot; that, carefully arranged into the kind of total and complete mess that only comes from hours of dedicated work. And the map showed it: perfectly arrayed, immaculately designed, beautifully annotated. It was a masterpiece.<br><br>Unfortunately, fate had other plans. A careless swipe of the weary badger&#39;s paw sent ink flying across the artfully designed map, ruining it all. The badger stared. He blinked.<br><br>A cry of anguish echoed into the distance.<br><br>&quot;Oi, mate! Some of us trying to catch some sleep!&quot; A vaguely sandwich-like entity appeared adjacent to the badger. <br><br>&quot;...Larf?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Bang on the money, gov!

He grinned in precisely the way that meat between bread usually didn&#39;t.<br><br>&quot;Urrrgh...&quot; The badger buried his head in his hands. &quot;Sorry to wake you up like that. I just ruined this map I&#39;ve been spending hours on. I calculated all the wind conditions and biome formations and everything! And it&#39;s just... gone. How can I call myself a worldbuilder now, without a world?&quot;<br><br>The sandwich squinted. Somehow. It didn&#39;t have eyes, so how the sandwich was able to do this was confusing. But it did nonetheless. &quot;Mate, you do know that you don&#39;t need to do that to build a world, right?&quot;<br><br>&quot;...Yeah, I do.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Nah, man. Just fudge it! See?&quot; The sandwich grabbed a parchment and quill with its not-hands and drew rapidly. &quot;See, that looks about right, eh?&quot;<br><br>The badger blinked. &quot;...I mean... I guess yeah?&quot;<br><br>&quot;There ya go! See? You don&#39;t need all that math guff, do ya? C&#39;mon, I&#39;ll help you out.&quot;<br><br>The black-and-white striped mammal sighed again. &quot;What would I do without you, Larf?&quot;<br><br>The sandwich smirked, seemingly uncaring that this was blatantly impossible. &quot;Sleep alone, proabably...&quot;<br><br>((This is loosely based on a real conversation in Discord.

            <p><i>Summary: The PPC brought them together. Can a badfic tear them apart? This is a sort-of-standalone ship fic in MoaM reality, set after the events of “Man on a Mission”. (MoaM reality is a different reality from the Shipverse, in deference to its occasionally dark subject matter. TL;DR: MoaM reality’s two defining characteristics are its Agent!Boarders premise and the events of MoaM: the ultimately successful sporking of a nasty Wolfenstein 3D bleepfic that made some very odd things happen to various agents. How exactly did all of this happen? It&#39;s still being finished.)</i><br><br>It had been a year since the sporking of “Fountain of Youth”, and Huinesoron had only recently found out that Intern Twistey had never taken the necessary Bleeprin to recover from the incident.<br><br>“No, no, I’m fine,” she had insisted when questioned about it. “My own imagination has come up with worse. Even before the fic came out, or before I knew about Celebrian or Rose Potter or-.”<br><br>“If that’s the case,” hS had replied, “you really need the Bleeprin.”<br><br>She had put one hand on her hip. “Do I now. How much did you prescribe to me, again?”<br><br>“Mm… one pill daily for three weeks, if I recall.”<br><br>“Jesus, that’s a lot.”<br><br>“A serious amount for a serious event. No amount of insistence is going to get you out of this.”<br><br>She had rolled her eyes, then been called over by Intern Willis, who wanted to show her a Suvian artifact he’d traded for with an agent. Huinesoron had never had a chance since then to catch up to Twistey about the Bleeprin. It really didn’t make any sense to him that she was resisting, as she’d clearly been the hardest hit by the fic, and he secretly feared that she felt no different about what had happened to her than she had in her original brainwashed state. Bleugh, it was sickening to think about.<br><br>He was trying to figure out how to get the Bleeprin, and possibly some Anti-Lustin, into Twistey’s food when [BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEP!!!]<br><br>Huinesoron was jolted out of his thoughts by the sound, and looked up to see Kaitlyn dashing for the console. She pressed the button and motioned him over. “Let’s see what we have this time.”<br><br>hS and Kaitlyn had been moved by Upstairs to the Department of Floaters for an indeterminate amount of time, and had been assigned no badfics with any unpleasant content for that amount of time. Well, the Sunflower Official had said that it was “until the mess from when you wantonly seized command of all Boarders has been sorted out,” but who knows what all he had meant by that. In the meantime, the two of them had received nothing but the most inoffensive of badfics, in order to be properly “readjusted”. Of course, Huinesoron had insisted that he was fine now, but the SO is hard to convince.<br><br>“Looks like nothing’s changed,” said Kaitlyn. “This one’s a crossover.”<br><br>Huinesoron looked a bit closer. “Hmm.” Then he cleared his throat.<br>“Thaw The Frozen Heart (DDLC X Frozen X Baldi’s Basics - Ice!Monika X Fire!Male!Reader, IceXFire!Cutcake)” He paused. “What’s Cutcake?”<br><br>“Well, it’s a ship name… sounds like a character who likes knives and a character who bakes. Which would be…” she scrolled through the fic… “Yuri and Natsuki.” She looked at her husband. “Nice wordplay for a badfic.”<br><br>hS smiled at his wife. At least she was enjoying these tamer missions. Personally, although he would do anything to protect canon, these ones brought him no adrenaline whatsoever. There had to be something truly shocking for the sporking to be truly satisfying. And this one was so close to being there… Doki Doki Literature Club and Baldi’s Basics in Education and Learning were both horror games, but this was just a lighthearted romance fic with other continua thrown in for extra flavor.<br><br>He continued reading the description. “When you transferred to your friend Light!Sayori’s high school and she invited you to the school literature club, you didn’t realize you’d meet the love of your life. But the school holds more danger than you realize. Your math teacher Mr. Darkness!Baldi is keen on making you miserable. But you are determined to thaw Ice!Monika’s frozen heart.”<br><br>“Wow,” said hS, “there’s elements other than ice and fire in this. Good job, Frozen fanbase, you’ve learned something.”<br><br>Kaitlyn laughed for a bit. “Okay, it’s a reader fic. Where’s the crash dummy?”<br><br>He shrugged and shook his head. “I don’t know, I think Twistey tried to marry it or something.”<br><br>“I doubt that’s the case.” Kaitlyn turned to face the opposite direction and leaned on the console. “Let me go look for it-”<br><br>A portal opened exactly where hS was. “Aaah!” he cried as he was sucked into its depths.<br><br>Kaitlyn stood shocked for a second, then shook herself, quickly grabbed a backpack full of agent gear, and followed.<br><br>-Twistey</p>

            <p><i>Summary: A bunch of Boarder couples enter a virtual-reality WWII strategy game, each getting to experience life from the perspectives of a world leader at the time and his significant other. The results are surprising.</i><br><br>Ah, Paris. The city of love.<br><br>“Isn’t it beautiful, Kaitlyn?” gushed Huinesoron. “All the trees and the sky and there’s the Eiffel Tower, and…”<br><br>Kaitlyn was smiling too. “I’d really hate to see all of this get bombed.”<br><br>“Oh yeah… there’s that…” He exhaled. “Nesh and I declared war on Twistey and Willis earlier today, and that means we could actually be targeted in a bombing raid eventually.” hS became melancholy, taking everything in as if he would never see it again.<br><br>“Don’t feel too bad. It had to be done.”<br><br>“That’s the worst part. I just can’t believe what she’s been up to.”<br><br>“Playing by the script, it seems. Playing <i>exactly</i> by the script.”<br><br>------<br><br>It was a cold day in Moscow, but Snowblaze didn’t mind. She loved the weather here.<br><br>“How do I look in this gleaming white uniform?” she asked her lover, who I shall let the other Boarders choose, while studying herself in the mirror.<br><br>“Very dashing, Comrade Snowblaze.”<br><br>“Thank you, comrade.” Then they both burst out laughing.<br><br>“So, about the deal to split up Poland… d’ya think she’s going to betray you?”<br><br>“I <i>know</i> she’s going to betray me.” Snowblaze turned around. “We’ve had a rivalry going for a while.”<br><br>“But she’s the history freak. She knows Russia is too cold and too populous to be successfully invaded.”<br><br>“She’s a freak in general. She won’t stop.” She laughed. “I say that with affection.”<br><br>------<br><br>“I feel disgusting with this thing on my arm,” remarked Twistey to no one in particular.<br><br>“Then take it off,” replied Willis with a shrug.<br><br>“I can’t. Not while I’m working. I have to play along or else get overthrown by my own officers.”<br><br>“Suit yourself.”<br><br>Twistey leaned back in her chair and closed her eyes. “If this were truly historically accurate, they wouldn’t let a woman lead Germany anyway. I’ve got to always remember that.”<br><br>There was a knock on the door. “Come in.” <br><br>An out-of-breath young soldier walked in. Twistey quickly tried to look serious and intimidating. “Yes? What is it?”<br><br>He handed her a letter across the desk. “Britain and France have declared war.”<br><br>“Thank you, you are dismissed.” As the soldier left, Twistey turned to Willis. “So it begins.”<br><br>“Do you think we’ll be able to beat France if it’s being run by, uh, what’s his face?”<br><br>“HWEEN-ay-SORE-on. And I don’t know. But we’ll definitely have to watch out for Great Britain, since Neshomeh and Phobos are in charge.”<br><br>“Nesh seems nice.”<br><br>“She’s always nice until I pull a stunt like this. So are half the oldbies. The other half just ignore it.”<br><br>“Hindsight 20/20.”<br><br>The door burst open. Once again, Twistey sat up in her chair and adopted a stern expression. She needed it, as now she was face to face with the chief of the SS, Heinrich Himmler.<br><br>“When are you going to implement the Final Solution?” he demanded. “I believe it’s time now to begin.”<br><br>Twistey paused. “It, ah, it will come… Where did I say that the Jews were the prob- I mean, what I was going to do with them?”<br><br>“In here.” He put a copy of <i>Mein Kampf</i> on top of the desk. “Perhaps you should read through it again, and recollect exactly what you came here to do.”<br><br>“Thank you. You are dismissed.”<br><br>Being published was what every Boarder dreamed of. And here she was, with a book she wrote. At least, she did in this virtual-reality world that Tomash, Thoth, and her friend Sigma from Newgrounds had coded as part of the move towards the creation of strategy games for the PPCers to enjoy. But the words sure didn’t <i>sound</i> like her, the way they were written. She wouldn&#39;t leave that many typos in a book. And the ideas presented in it were even <i>worse</i>.<br><br>That was the problem. The simulation, being focused on military tactics, started with the day that the war did. How Twistey had come to power was completely out of her control. And now she was going to look like a coward who couldn’t keep promises.<br><br>“Ohhhhhhh God. Remind me again why I did this,” she murmured to Willis.<br><br>“Why you convinced them to build the simulation, or why you kinda automatically flung yourself into this particular role?”<br><br>“The latter.”<br><br>He shrugged. “I dunno. Just like me when we play <i>Axis and Allies</i>. Someone has to.”<br><br><i>More are coming. Feel free to make spinoffs.</i><br><br>-Twistey</p>

            <p><i>Remember I mentioned my “friend Sigma64 from Newgrounds”, casting him as one of the people who’d developed the simulation? I told him about the Ship War. I think he’ll be all right with this depiction. Sigma is generally cool with anything.</i><br><br>It was well past dark when Twistey returned home. A long day of dealing with literally every other player except for Willis, and some AIs on top of that, had left her exhausted. She was ready to just go to bed. But what a sight was waiting for her when she opened the door.<br><br>In the foyer of the house stood a girl about her age with wavy red locks that cascaded down her back. Her blue eyes sparkled in the light, and she wore a warm and mischievous smile accentuated with red lipstick. And she was… definitely decently endowed. Curves in all the right places, not helped by the style of her red dress. It was definitely Willis, and it was also definitely a woman, but, but, but… <br><br>Twistey’s mouth hung open. “W-what the hell?!”<br><br>“Hiyeeeeee~!” Willis waved upon seeing Twistey. “I got bored and found an exploitable glitch in the game. Do you like it?” He, um, <i>she</i> wiggled her eyebrows.<br><br>Twistey stalled. “Uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh… I’m really getting some Bowsette vibes here.”<br><br>She laughed. “You know it!”<br><br>Twistey made a show of walking <i>around</i> Willis and into the living room. She sat down on a couch, then shook herself and laughed. “I’m just really shaken. By everything. I’ve been struggling to hold onto my initial expectations of what this would’ve been like, and this confirms even further that they were wrong.”<br><br>Wi- er, let’s call her Phyllis, looked sad. “Oh, I’m sorry. I thought you’d get a laugh out of it. Do you want me to change back?”<br><br>“No, no, you’re fine. It’s my fault for power tripping so hard that I have a physical reaction to the same gender-bending stuff you’ve been doing since we became a thing.”<br><br>“It is not your fault!” Phyllis tackled Twistey onto the couch, only flustering the leader even more with her female squishiness.<br><br>“All of this is my fault. I provoked the start of the war, or I mean I put myself into the role that provoked the start of the war, after all. I’ll be lucky if I can get out without being assassinated.”<br><br>Phyllis was about to object when there was a knock at the door.<br><br>“I’ll get that!” announced Twistey. But Phyllis wouldn’t budge.<br><br>“No, you’re staying here with me so I can un-sad you!”<br><br>“But I-”<br><br>Then, from a distance, they saw a young man walk <i>through</i> the door.<br><br><br><br>Phyllis quickly moved off of Twistey and sat down next to her. “I swear that wasn’t what it looked like!”<br><br>“I know,” the young man replied as he approached them. “I saw all of it, and I can sympathize with your situation here.”<br><br>“That’s creepy,” muttered Phyllis.<br><br>“I try not to be,” he shrugged. “I switch to someone else’s view whenever I feel I’m looking at something I shouldn’t be.”<br><br>“Wha…” Twistey’s eyes were wide. “Who are you?!”<br><br>“Oh yeah, that’s right, I haven’t updated my profile picture yet according to your suggestions, so you don’t know what I look like.” He extended his hand. “I am Sigma64.”<br><br>“Oh! Sigma! Hi!” She breathed a sigh of relief. <br><br>“That’s your friend from Newgrounds, right?” whispered Phyllis to Twistey while she shook Sigma’s hand. <br><br>“Yeah. The guy I found when I was looking for fellow <i>Wolfenstein 3D</i> fans on Scratch. You and I still need to play it together.”<br><br>Sigma laughed. “100% Sigma approved. Have you found a co-op mod you like yet?”<br><br>“I was thinking of just having him play the game and laughing over his shoulder. But that’s not important.” Twistey looked curious. “The important thing is, what’s one of the developers doing meddling in the affairs of mortals?”<br><br>“I have a remedy for your plight,” replied Sigma, as he started to walk around. “I, with my code and developer permissions, can fix everything. I can retcon the entire Holocaust out of existence, along with any mentions of anti-Semitism in anything associated with you.”<br><br>“No, thanks, I’ve managed to get it all back under control. Why’d you even put it there in the first place?”<br><br>He shrugged. “It actually wasn’t my job to implement it. I don’t know whose it was. But I did notice that you were sad about not getting the epic showdown you wanted. As you know by now, I also love a good Nazi boss battle. It’d be a shame not to have one.”<br><br>“You sure it’s not going to end badly? I mean, I’m leading a Germany that’s got this piece of junk pasted all over it, the same piece of junk used by some pretty bad actual racists.” She pointed to… yeah, you know.<br><br>Sigma shook himself. “Wait, what? Isn’t that the point of the game? Those Allies kinda let you go with that already, anyway. I mean, it’s just a fun simulation, and they know it is, so long as you keep it fun.”<br><br>“Yeah, true. But I didn’t keep it fun.” She leaned back on the couch and stared at the ceiling. “Y’know, like an idiot.”<br><br>“You said only two words’ worth of politically incorrect and only three words’ worth of factually incorrect. That’s not bad. So let’s do like Huinesoron said and ditch the depressing parts. No killing people, just zombie armies and occult powers, all wrapped up in an impressive castle with a huge underground complex beneath it. It’s time to get ridiculous!” He raised his fist.<br><br>“Yeah!” Phyllis stood up and did the same. “As long as I get power too!”<br><br>“Oh, you will. And the Allies will, too, so that they don’t feel like I’m just bailing you two out. I’ll visit them all in turn.” He turned to look at the couch. “Twistey?”<br><br>Twistey hesitated for a bit, thinking of all the pain of her mistakes. Then she slowly stood. She raised her arm so it was straight out in front of her, her fingers were closed… and then turned the offensive salute into a dab. Everyone rejoiced.<br><br><br><br>Welcome to Ship War: Ridiculous Edition.<br><br>THEMATIC MUSIC: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oi3QmAmrG6M"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oi3QmAmrG6M">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oi3QmAmrG6M</a></a> <br><br>-Twistey</p>

            <p>Snowblaze sat at the head of the table, her generals and advisors all around her. She didn&#39;t really know enough history to know exactly who they were, despite the Wikipedia research she&#39;d done before entering the simulation.<br><br>&quot;As you know,&quot; she began, slightly nervously, feeling very grateful that the coders of this simulation had built in automatic translation, &quot;Britain and France declared war on Germany earlier today.&quot; <br><br>She paused, hoping to make it up as she went along from here. &quot;This, of course, does not in any way change our position on our pact with Germany. We will still hold to it until such a time as they violate the terms or it expires.&quot;<br><br>If Twistey was going to be historically accurate, that meant that they&#39;d have to wait a whole two years before they could attack. Which was a real pain, considering that Snowblaze was a ruthless game-player and intended to conquer the world as quickly as she could.<br><br>Suddenly she was struck by a brilliant idea: why couldn&#39;t she go the other way and invade <i>America</i>? Okay, her Reddish-White Army (as she was mentally calling it) would have to make a slight sea journey, but still, it was definitely worth it. And if America was hers, she&#39;d have the pure military strength to crush anyone who dared to stand in her way.<br><br>Saving her brainwave for later, she continued: &quot;We do not currently choose to ally ourselves with Germany, although I will remain open to the possibility if they are willing to form an offensive alliance. Therefore the Soviet Union is currently not at war and will remain so in the immediate future.&quot; <br><br>She wasn&#39;t exactly the world&#39;s best speechmaker, but this would do the job. Unless the programmers were feeling particularly sadistic. <br><br>&quot;However, it is likely that at some point circumstances will change and we will join the war, on one side or the other. Therefore we must have our Red Army on standby, ready to move at a moment&#39;s notice. Is the council in agreement?&quot;<br><br>As she hadn&#39;t exactly said anything controversial, they all nodded and gave their assent.<br><br>&quot;Thank you,&quot; she said, and retired to her private chambers to plot the invasion of America.<br><br><br><br>(Well, the point of the game is to rule the world, right? Also, I admit it, I did do some wiki research IRL.)<br><br><br></p>

            <p>&quot;They&#39;re not going for it.&quot;<br><br>Huinesoron stepped up behind his wife, slipping his arms around her waist. &quot;No?&quot;<br><br>Kaitlyn sighed and turned from the view, nestling her head on his shoulder. &quot;No. Hardric wants chunks of Italy, Snowblaze wants us all to go Communist, NeshBosh want, I dunno...&quot;<br><br>Huinesoron&#39;s lip twitched. &quot;Tea?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Right.&quot; His wife looked up at him. &quot;And we want reparations for a whole bunch of stuff we&#39;re not going to get. We&#39;ll never reach an agreement.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I still think my plan will work.&quot; Huinesoron stepped forward, Kaitlyn turning until they stood arm in arm, gazing out over the streets of Paris. &quot;Nesh said it - &#39;make love, not war&#39;. If we just marry you to everyone--&quot;<br><br>Kaitlyn elbowed him in the ribs. &quot;It <i>won&#39;t</i> work,&quot; she said firmly. &quot;Twistey and Willis have that whole &#39;monogamy&#39; thing going on. Unlike certain husbands of mine,&quot; she jabbed out with her elbow again, but Huinesoron squirmed away, &quot;they&#39;re not obsessed with setting each other up for threesomes.&quot;<br><br>&quot;That&#39;s unfair,&quot; Huinesoron protested, but quailed before his wife&#39;s arched eyebrow. &quot;Not <i>just</i> threesomes,&quot; he clarified.<br><br>Kaitlyn snorted. &quot;Right, right.&quot; She leant on the railing, staring out at the brightening eastern horizon. &quot;It&#39;s going to be war, though.&quot;<br><br>&quot;... yeah.&quot; Huinesoron placed his hand lightly on her shoulder. His brow furrowed in thought; then he turned away, flicking his fingers to bring up the simulation&#39;s radio system. &quot;In that case, and since Neshomeh&#39;s not using it, I suppose we should do this properly.&quot;<br><br>With a faint fizzing sound, a microphone appeared in front of him. He cleared his throat, then glanced sidelong at his wife. &quot;Unless you&#39;d rather do the honours?&quot;<br><br>&quot;No, no.&quot; Kaitlyn waved indulgently. &quot;You&#39;ll enjoy it a lot more.&quot;<br><br>&quot;All right.&quot; Closing his eyes, Huinesoron took a deep breath, then tapped the microphone. &quot;This is a priority transmission breaking across all commercial and private frequencies,&quot; he announced. &quot;This morning, the Bri- <i>French</i> ambassador in Berlin handed the German government a final note, stating that unless we heard from them by 11 o&#39;clock that they were prepared at once to withdraw their troops from Poland, a state of war would exist between us.<br><br>&quot;I have to tell you now that no such undertaking has been received, and consequently, this country is at war with Germany.&quot;<br><br>He paused, lifting his head to meet Kaitlyn&#39;s gaze across the open mic, and a crooked grin crossed his face.<br><br>&quot;Game on,&quot; he whispered, and cut the feed.<br><br>~<br><br>(With gratitude to Neville Chaimberlain, and also Jenny Sparks of the Authority.)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>When Snowblaze&#39;s lover entered the courtyard he found her lying flat on her face in a heap of snow. Random body parts were distributed around her, which would have looked grisly if they weren&#39;t made of snow.<br><br>&quot;Snowblaze! What&#39;s wrong?&quot;<br><br>She sat up, snow in her thick hair, and her lover was struck once more with how beautiful she looked.<br><br>&quot;Well,&quot; she began, &quot;I was trying to make snow soldiers to defend against Twistey&#39;s inevitable betrayal, because they&#39;re so much more convenient. You don&#39;t need to feed them or give them leave or actually lose them, because I can just rebuild them if they get destroyed.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Nice! So, what&#39;s the problem with that?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Well, I suddenly realised that the colour scheme was all wrong. If we&#39;re being historically accurate, I&#39;m meant to have a Red Army... and snow is white.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Oh. I see.&quot;<br><br>&quot;And if I change it to the White Army everyone will be mad, because the Whites were the ones the revolution overthrew and they&#39;ll start saying I&#39;m an aristocrat and there&#39;ll be another revolution.&quot;<br><br>She sighed. &quot;Which would obviously be a bad thing... but on the other hand, no way am I spending loads of money on red uniforms for <i>snow</i>. So... what do I do?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Stop trying to game the rules and use real soldiers?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I told you. Too expensive, and you can&#39;t bring them back.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Stop worrying and come and have fun with me?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Now <i>that</i> sounds like a good idea.&quot;<br><br>(It&#39;s really hard writing when you don&#39;t know the pronouns of one of your characters.)<br></p>

Have you <i>talked</i> to the German people? Cuz either this is a really shite simulation where none of the NPCs get lines, or most of them don&#39;t actually like the whole fascism and genocide thing that much! It&#39;s just that when the police are legally empowered to break down your door and murder your family members on the merest suspicion of noncompliance with the regime, it tends to make folks a little scared of speaking up, you know?<br><br>The German people are certainly desperate, but it&#39;s more for things like food and safety and the liberty to walk the streets at night without worrying about being bombed or shot, wot? The people here in England would rather like to have those things back soon, too! Perhaps we can agree that this is all bloody stupid and bring it to a stop like responsible adults in this sim? Then we can all snog and make up. ^_^<br><br>Make love not war!<br><br>Cheers,<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

I’d like to say I’m sorry, even though it hurts to do so instead of trying to hurriedly forget it all.<br><br>I get that things were made less enjoyable by my actions. For all I know, y’all may be boycotting Ship War until I apologize, which is totally understandable. But let’s not be sad anymore. Now that I’ve dealt with this out of universe, I have a plan with how to deal with this in-universe. You guys will be able to read said plan pretty soon.

            <p>It kinda takes away from the apology if you try to make it about acknowledging how hard it is for you and moving on right away so <i>you</i> feel better. An apology is not for you, it&#39;s to show the other person(s) you actually care about their feelings. The other party is the one who gets to decide whether or not to &quot;be sad anymore.&quot;<br><br>Personally, I never was &quot;sad,&quot; and I&#39;m not boycotting the Shipfest; I just didn&#39;t have that much investment in it to begin with. Also, so far I&#39;ve assumed you&#39;re about thirteen at most, so I am patiently waiting for the day you have enough life experience and corrections under your belt to truly understand why this fixation you have on WWII stuff makes us uncomfortable and <i>drop it</i>. You <i>are</i> learning, so I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll get there, and we will continue to help by giving said corrections as needed.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>&quot;I still think I should have had the French role.&quot;<br><br>Huinesoron sat back and sipped at his wine, then grimaced and put it to one side. &quot;Ugh. Sorry, what were you saying?&quot;<br><br>Hardric rolled his eyes. &quot;As your bishop, I&#39;m pretty sure I&#39;m supposed to say wine is a mocker.&quot;<br><br>&quot;You&#39;re not <i>my</i> bishop.&quot; Huinesoron gestured around the simulated Casa de la Vall, making some undefined point. &quot;Was that all, most esteemed co-Prince?&quot;<br><br>&quot;No.&quot; Hardric folded his arms, then refolded them to get the floppy sleeves to settle right. &quot;You don&#39;t even <i>speak</i> French; I would be much more suited to your role.&quot;<br><br>&quot;<i>Je suis un oiseau dans le chateau</i>,&quot; Huinesoron said vaguely. &quot;Besides, by that logic I should have Britain, instead of Captain Tea-Pants and the Betraying Betrayer.&quot;<br><br>&quot;You&#39;re not taking this at all seriously!&quot; Hardric protested. &quot;I warn you, if I don&#39;t get the respect I deserve, I may have to declare war.&quot;<br><br>Huinesoron raised an eyebrow. &quot;Sorry - you&#39;re still just Bishop of Urgell, right?&quot;<br><br>Hardric flicked his hand, dismissing the words. &quot;I mean of course, <i>Andorra</i> will declare war.&quot;<br><br>&quot;We&#39;re <i>co</i>-princes,&quot; Huinesoron pointed out. &quot;You can&#39;t declare on France without my agreement. Which you&#39;re not going to get, for obvious reasons.&quot;<br><br>Hardric&#39;s eyes narrowed dangerously. &quot;You&#39;re going to have to go back to Paris sometime,&quot; he said. &quot;Do you really think our people won&#39;t follow me...?&quot;<br><br>&quot;They didn&#39;t in real history.&quot; Huinesoron sighed and straightened up. &quot;Look, I get it - Bishop of Urgell isn&#39;t the most exciting role.&quot; He thought for a moment, then snapped his fingers. &quot;I don&#39;t think anyone&#39;s playing Spain, are they? If it&#39;s a coup you want, you could always try Madrid on for size...&quot;<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Willis had slept in late today.<br><br>Twistey wasn&#39;t too concerned, this was something he did from time to time. What did concern her was the fact that he was still in bed after she&#39;d gotten back from a leisurely breakfast and some chats with friends. Even with HQ&#39;s temporal weirdness, it had to have been a couple hours.<br><br>She sat on the edge of his bed and gently ruffled his bright red hair. &quot;Morning, sleepyhead.&quot;<br><br>Willis responded with a muffled groan. &quot;&#39;M tired, Twistey. Didn&#39;t sleep well last night.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Bad dream?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Think so. Don&#39;t even remember what it was. Somethin&#39; that should&#39;ve been silly, I think. All I remember&#39;s there were lots of weasels. Whatever happened, I doubt I got more&#39;n a couple hours in.&quot;<br><br>Twistey stroked her boyfriend&#39;s hair. &quot;I&#39;m right here, Willis. You&#39;re safe, in your own bed, and there&#39;s no weasels in the RC.&quot; Kicking off her shoes, she slipped in to cuddle Willis. &quot;Get some rest. I&#39;ll keep you safe.&quot;<br><br>It was then that the Ironic Overpower provided a BEEP!<br><br>Twistey was having none of her console&#39;s fuvg. &quot;Console. Sleep is important. There comes a point at which your antics are no longer funny. If you don&#39;t let us sleep I&#39;m rewiring you into a microwave. Understood?&quot;<br><br>The console bipped in slightly terrified agreement.<br><br>&quot;I&#39;ll get to you when we&#39;re both rested. Until then, no noise.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Nice.&quot; Willis gave Twistey an affectionate nuzzle. &quot;How&#39;d you think of that?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Spend long enough in HQ and you&#39;re bound to hear that trick eventually. I think it was Jay who came up with it.&quot; Twistey wrapped her arms around Willis and smiled. &quot;Let&#39;s get some rest. You need it.&quot;<br><br>Willis smiled back and reached over to turn out the light. &quot;Yeah. With the workload here, I bet catching up on sleep&#39;ll do us both good.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Love you, Willis.&quot; Twistey curled up against him, soaking in the warmth.<br><br>Willis tried to reply, but exhaustion overtook him before he could. Smiling softly, Twistey closed her eyes, snuggling up to him and letting her mind go blank. It took her a bit longer to drift off, her being less tired than him, but soon enough she, too, was sleeping peacefully.<br><br>Neither of them dreamed of weasels.</p>

            <p>It was a dim and cloudy evening, just after sunset. Iximaz was passing through a park on the way home. Their eyes shone gold in what was left of the light, and their long pants covered a rather embarrassing scar that looked like a claw mark.<br><br>Then, very quickly, impossibly quickly, as if someone were speeding up the footage to skip though a long, boring processes, a full moon rose. In fact, four moons rose. They seemed to peer down at Iximaz with a collective smile.<br><br>“Oh, no.,” Ix muttered. They tried to keep theirself together through sheer force of will, holding back the explosion that was about to overcome them as best they could.<br><br>“Not. Time.” they grunted as patches of fur burst out of their skin in a few places. “Hate this.”<br><br><em>It’ll be OK, Ix.</em> the moons said, somehow. <em>I can help. This doesn’t have to a curse.</em><br><br><em>Really?</em> Ix thought, hoping that would get back to the voice they’d just heard, before yelping in pain as their bones shifted around. They roughly threw their bag to the ground so that it wouldn’t get too banged up during the rest of the transformation.<br><br>In response, the moons concentrated their light onto the transforming werewolf,, enveloping them in a warm, white glow. <em>I’ll help you through this.</em><br><br>As the moonlight surrounded Ix, their transformation much more fluid and graceful. Fur rippled out over their body as it slid into a more canine form without all the violent rearrangement that usually accompanied a full moon. Their face stretched out into a muzzle. A tail rose out from their lower back without the usual ‘pop’. Even their clothes neatly came off and floated onto Ix’s bag.<br><br><em>Wow.</em> Ix said. <em>Can it always be this easy? Also, thank gooodness I don’t need to replace that jacket.</em><br><br><em>Yeah, I can make this how your transformations usually go.</em> the moons said. <em>After all, I’m four moons, and that beats the one moon you usually deal with.</em><br><br>Ix’s tail wagged. <em>Nice!</em><br><br>There was a pause. <em>I like your jacket too, by the way.</em><br><br><em>Uh, OK, sure. Thanks!</em><br><br><em>No problem.</em> the moons said softly.<br><br>Ix took a few hesitant steps forward. This new way of being a werewolf sure left them a lot less exhausted than what they usually had to deal with. Then, filled with a burst of energy, they took off running around the park.<br><br><em>This is great!</em> they thought-shouted up at the sky as they ran. <em>I don’t think I’ve ever felt this good as a, y’know, wolf.</em><br><br><em>That was the plan. I noticed how miserable you were getting at night and thought I’d do something about it.</em><br><br>A few laps around the park later, Iximaz walked up to their stuff, panting. <em>I like this.</em> they said quietly. <em>I like you.</em><br><br><em>I like you too.</em> the four moons watching said.<br><br>Ix sat down. There was only one real way to properly express their thoughts on the situation, they realized:<br><br>“Awoooooooooooooooooo!”</p>

            <p>I would *so* do that if I was in this situation, I&#39;m too much of a mom friend not to. And I honestly find being portrayed as the literal moon in general hilarious and amazing. I don&#39;t really know what to say, how does one review a shipfest story anyway?</p>

            <p>It&#39;s good, but I feel like if you wanted to stretch the transformation=sex metaphor, you should have had Ix fall asleep contentedly under the watch of the moons instead of feeling more energized. Nice story, though.<br><br>:P</p>
