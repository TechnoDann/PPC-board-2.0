            <p>Sorry for two posts so close together, but they are unrelated. I remember reading a character analysis meta sort of thing a few years ago about Tony. It was pointing out how uses body language to fake confidence even in the early movies before he is showing overt signs for PTSD. Specifically, in how he would have been taught to never let his hands betray his nervousness, that if he thought they might to keep them busy. Such as by holding a glass of alcohol, which he does constantly. <br><br>I cannot find it now, and I was hoping someone else might have thought to actually bookmark it.</p>

            <p>Sure, it&#39;s sort of a minor point, and there&#39;s no way we&#39;re going to change it, but I like how tau makes radians a bit cleaner-looking (and how it makes the fact that the area formula for a circle comes out of integrating the circumference formula a bit more obvious).<br><br>- Tomash</p>

            <p>There&#39;s a few things that need to be cleared up before we can pack up and move to T-Board, if that&#39;s what we eventually want to do.<br><br>The main one is hosting.<br><br>T-Board currently is hosted on Heroku&#39;s free plan. The main drawback to this is that we can&#39;t have more than 10,000 database records (that&#39;s posts, users, etc.). Even accounting for the fact that we post slightly less than we used to, this would still mean kicking stuff off the Board much more often than we&#39;d like (I think). For reference, all the Other Board (and T-Board) content (which is mainly RPs) comes out to about 6500 rows. <br><br>One other problem with the current hosting is that, if no one accesses the T-Board for a while, it gets shut down and hen turned back on the next time someone shows up.<br><br>The solution to both of these problems is to find another place to put the thing. (For technical people, T-Board is a Ruby on Rails app backed by postgres.) It really isn&#39;t clear where though. Someone&#39;s basement server? The cloud? Something else entirely?<br><br>So, <b>question 1</b>: Where should we host a permanent T-Board instance if we decide to move to one?<br><br>Once we&#39;ve got proposals for that, we&#39;ll have problem 2: money. A lot of these hosting options will cost money. My general sense is that the sort of virtual private server the current Board runs on would be somewhere between $5-10 a month, but that there might be cheaper options (there&#39;s definitely more expensive ones). (Someone&#39;s basement is way cheaper, but has its own issues.)<br><br>This leads to <b>question 2</b>: If we need to pay for our new space, how&#39;re we going to manage that?<br><br>In the T-Board&#39;s case, we might be able to offset some (but probably not all) of the costs by running ads. I&#39;m personally not really a fan of tracker-heavy flashy ads, but I figure Google AdWords would be a relatively unintrusive addition to the site if we decided to go there.<br><br>And so we have <b>question 3</b>: If we move to T-Board, should we have ads on it, and, if so, what kind of ads?<br><br>That all covers the major issue I&#39;m seeing.<br><br>I&#39;ve got a few minor technical things I&#39;d like to clean up with the T-Board (adding a less painful way to delete stuff, bringing our web framework up-to-date, etc.). Between me and Delta, I suspect we have enough post-day-job programming time to keep bit-rot at bay. That being said, I&#39;m open to more help if anyone&#39;s around to offer it.<br><br>One other thing to note is that, with T-Board, we have effectively complete control over how our community space works. (The only downside to this is the possibility of long threads about how the links should be a different shade of red or something.)<br><br>This leads to <b>question 4</b>: What are your feature requests for, issues with, or complaints about T-Board?<br><br>- Tomash, your local neighborhood <del>wizard</del> <del>Tech-Priest</del> programmer</p>

            <p>Try beets. You can cook them in the microwave, just like potatoes (and probably all the root vegetables). Poke some holes in them, put them in a dish with a little water drizzled on, nuke for about ten minutes depending on number and size, with a rotation in the middle. Once you peel them, they&#39;re bright red or yellow (golden beets are a thing if you want to stick to the yellow-orange spectrum), and they have cool rings when you slice into them. {= D<br><br>Lately, I&#39;ve been doing a once-a-week pot of kitchari, which apparently is a traditional Ayurvedic healing dish, but I like it because it&#39;s got Indian spices, but isn&#39;t really hot-spicy, and I can take it to work and eat it cold without it making me feel cold. I&#39;ve been making it with lentils and split peas, rice, beets, carrots, and turnips, plus the spices and a bit of ghee for toasting the seed ones. Way better nutrition than peanut butter and jelly. It&#39;s kind of changed my life.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I don&#39;t pretend to understand how Web hosting works very well, so our Designated Tech Squad(tm) can feel free to correct me.<br><br>The main problems I see with hosting T-Board in someone&#39;s basement is that we need to trust the person hosting and the server (ideally) needs to be reliable; it&#39;s not really useful if the whole thing crashes when more than 10 people access it at the same time. Both of these are things to consider with paid hosting, too, but I think it&#39;s more likely to be an issue with cheaper/free hosting. I have no idea what kind of computational resources the Board/T-Board take; for all I know, someone could load it onto a Raspberry Pi for under $100 and then forget about it, but I somehow doubt that.<br><br>If we go for paid hosting, I think that ads are something to consider, but it depends on how the ads work. Most likely, ads generate revenue based on views, and I&#39;m willing to bet that a lot of us use some sort of ad blocker. Hmm.<br><br>In any case, the first thing to do would be to gather information on how hosting works and how much it would cost.</p>

            <p>Yeah, running off a Pi would be nice, but last I checked T-Board tends to grind even on its current setup under a heavy workload. This could probably be fixed (i dunno), but it hasn&#39;t been yet. To make matters worse, Rails is generally just very expensive RAM and computation-wise (although not as bad as it once was: Twitter used to use a frankly insane amount of RAM with each request because Rails would fire a large number of exceptions as part of normal operation (falling off the end of a list while iterating, deliberately, and then just catching the exception)).<br><br>So, hosting. EC2 is the standard, and it&#39;s pretty cheap on an hourly basis, as is Amazon&#39;s associated storage. Thing is, of course, that we&#39;re running over years and stuff. That adds up. However, assuming PGSQL and Ruby don&#39;t do anything stupid, the compute time we use in a given year will be a lot less than a year&#39;s worth of compute: in theory, they ought to be spending most of their time waiting for requests, that is, doing nothing. In light of this, I suspect we could comfortably run off a T2 small, or maybe even a micro, which costs a few cents per hour. Storage is ten cents per GB per month. I suspect $10 a month would cover us. Take that with a grain of salt: I&#39;m not an admin. So we&#39;re probably looking at $15-20 a month, maybe? Probably less? Plus DNS costs, unless we get a free subdomain off someone (quite a number of services offer that).<br><br>Seriously take this with a grain of salt. I got all of this by squinting at EC2&#39;s website and guessing.</p>

(Also, someone else has a <i>Trek</i>-style door now, eh? I wonder about the period of PPC history in which people were going around installing those and the various replicators. Must&#39;ve been fun.)<br><br>5. “You’ll also note that I said, <u>“let’s”</u> live a little, ...&quot; --&gt; &#39;let&#39;s&#39; -- when you have a quotation inside a quotation, the nested quote marks change from double to single (or vice versa). Personally, I think italics indicating spoken emphasis on the word would be better here, but that&#39;s a style thing. {= )<br><br>My only other comment, based on the descriptions of things the agents have seen, is this: try not to make every mission a giant squickfest. For one thing, it&#39;s not a competition (and I don&#39;t say this arbitrarily; we had that happen for a while years ago, and it got unpleasant), and for another thing, the whole point of Floaters is variety. Make sure to throw them something completely different every now and then. {= )<br><br>That said, go forth and PPC, young human!<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Yay!  Good to read some more of Jenni&#39;s backstory, especially with a rare glimpse from her perspective.  It goes a long way to explain the way she tends to react around people, and why she&#39;s so attached to Henry.  I love how focused she remains on baby Henry, even when the two Nursery staffers keep trying to talk to her.<br><br>It&#39;s amazing how details from years ago seem to have a tendency to slot into place for us, isn&#39;t it?  &quot;Edward&quot; &quot;Henry&quot; and &quot;Christine&quot; were all named by different people, but they all fit together to write a joke about stage musical references in 2019 that took place in 2009.<br><br>We&#39;ll collectively have to work on fleshing out Christine a bit.  &quot;The woman in charge&quot; isn&#39;t very specific, but I can imagine the Nursery as being one division that <i>didn&#39;t</i> receive a Flower as its head, since understanding animalian minds and bodies is a little more critical to child-rearing than it is for most divisions.  Or maybe the Flowers just find humanoid development cycles too squicky, and none of them wanted the position?<br><br>—doctorlit really needs to make progress on his Nursery spin-off.  Just as soon as he finishes <i>Kingdom Hearts 3</i>.<br>ghc</p>

            <p>If you believe the Histories, the Nursery started off being for Plants, and likely would have had a Plant in charge. At some point, it moved away from that, though, so Christine could be the woman in charge of the human part.<br><br>... D&#39;you reckon the Nursery might actually be a department, with divisions for infants, housing/daycare, schooling, and so forth? And maybe a tiny one for Plants, if new ones still happen?<br><br>Tangentially, the other day, I was looking around to see if I could find the earliest, or at least <i>an early</i> reference to agents bringing a Sue&#39;s kid back to HQ instead of assassinating it. I could swear I remember reading something to the effect of &quot;we can give it to the Bleeding Hearts back at Headquarters,&quot; but I have no idea where it is. I could only find a couple references to the Bleeding Hearts Unit of the DMS, too, and nothing to do with taking care of kids with them. (I think they were more about non-violently dealing with Sues?)<br><br>The Nursery wiki page is in a sad state, though. It would be nice to fix it, which is why I was poking around. If you (or anyone!) know where to find some good references besides the couple on the Complete List of PPC Fiction, I&#39;d love to have them.<br><br>Anyway: Thanks! I&#39;m glad you like Jenni&#39;s POV, because there&#39;s more steadily working its way down the writing pipeline.<br><br>I love how details align like that, too. ^_^<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I could easily see the Nursery being a department, if more of us starting writing about the kids our agents adopt instead of side characters that pop up occasionally.  Not sure there&#39;s much need to change it at the moment, though.<br><br>—doctorlit, neglecting his writing</p>

<br>I&#39;d recommend this fic since it does a good job of showing the effects of the war on all the characters and doesn&#39;t provide a particularly happy ending despite the spoilerly thing I rot13&#39;d in the summary not happening.<br><br>It&#39;s also got a bunch of funny moments and, as near as I can tell, keeps everyone pretty well in character.</p>

            <p>...And recommend a set of classic 40k fics that have no right to be as good as it is:  Warhammer High.<br><br>WHH is an AU where the Heresy never happened, The Great Crusade properly ended, the galaxy is peaceful (relatively: this IS 40k, so think less noticeable constant war), and all the primarchs had wives and daughters. Depending on the fic, sometimes they also had sons. We usually ignore that because the sons don&#39;t show up so much in the good stuff.<br><br>However, WHH is really big, with tons of different fics by different authors of varying quality. It can be difficult to start. So now I must present the OFFICIAL THOTH LIST OF WHH STUFF WORTH READING.<br><br>(Warning, this is a /tg/ AU and 1d4chan is the repo of record for the thing. As a result, you should just generally assume that all of these pages may contain swearwords. I will try to warn of outright NSFW content, but I may miss something.)<br><br>And the list is basically just anything by Someone Else (a Who&#39;s On First name if I&#39;ve ever heard one). Someone Else is <i>the<i> reason why WHH is as good as it is. He&#39;s brilliant. In particular, you need to read his series of 4 WHH fics, which are as follows:<br><br>-<a href="https://1d4chan.org/wiki/Venus%27_Burn">Venus&#39; Burn</a> (NSFW). All about Vulkan&#39;s daughter and her boyfriend. This is about as mild as a smutfic gets, and with so much plot you&#39;d be forgiven for missimg the smut. It&#39;s also really really really good. And adorable: Someone Else is a sucker for a happy ending.<br><br>-<a href="https://1d4chan.org/wiki/Bleeding_Out_(Warhammer_High)">Bleeding Out</a>. A primarch&#39;s daughter gets shot, and it goes downhill from there. It takes a deeper dive into the angst and depression and feelings of inadequacy around the daughters and generally has that feeling of angst. And yet it doesn&#39;t feel overly angsty. It feels compelling. Did I mentipn it&#39;s novel length?<br><br>-<a href="https://1d4chan.org/wiki/Story:ROAD_TRIP!_(Warhammer_High)">ROAD TRIP!</a> and <a href="https://1d4chan.org/wiki/Eternity_(Warhammer_High)">Eternity</a>... I&#39;ll confess I haven&#39;t read these yet. But everyone says they&#39;re great, and having read these, I believe them.<br><br>Also:<br><br>-<a href="https://1d4chan.org/wiki/Warhammer_High#Furia.27s_Failed_Date">Furia&#39;s Failed Dare&gt;: This feels a bit like a prototype for Bleeding Out. It&#39;s good, though.<br><br>There are a ton of other good stories around. That&#39;s just a starter.</a></i></i></p>

            <p>I&#39;ll be recommending an autor here, <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/u/7987673/GhostXavier">GhostXavier</a>, and his series <i>Fragments of Chaldea</i>, who forms a slice-of-life series about the organization at the heart of Fate Grand Order. Very nice at slice of life and fluff, and funny moments. <br>Some of the major events of the story got their own story, pretty awesome too, although the author unfortunately disconitnued them for cause of Real Life. Drafts of these extra stories are still published in an &#39;extra scenes&#39; story.<br>Still ongoing, going through the events between Year 1 and 2 of the game, and available on AO3 if you want to read them in Entire Work mode (although with one chapter of delay compared to ff.net).<br><br>I&#39;ll also recommend the auhor <a href="https://forums.spacebattles.com/members/cerulean.310501/">Cerulean</a>, both for his Worm AU fanfics Intrepid and Absolution, and his original stories Heretical Edge and Summus Proelium, this one just starting.<br><br>Be assured everything here is more than worth the read.</p>

However, where this fic differs from Fragments is that the story is written as a sequel to the Good ending of Stay Night’s UBW storyline, with protagonists, referred to here as Ritsuka and Kana, being the children of Rin and Shiro. This alone allows for deeper character interactions between some of the servants and their masters, and is only bolstered by the author’s comedic and storytelling abilities. Highly recommended.</p>

            <p>Willis... has a grievance that, like all his grievances, he doesn&#39;t want to air to anyone except me. So I decided to air it myself, as it&#39;s left him with a bad taste in his mouth about the PPC in general, or at least &quot;the influential Boarders&quot; (aka oldbies), and therefore it really needs to be put out into the open.<br><br>This concerns the &quot;Elves Aren&#39;t Supposed To Be Buff&quot; spinoff. Willis mentioned to me that he found it a bit creepy that you were writing a one-shot of &quot;a stand-in for [you] intimidating a stand-in for me.&quot; He said he also felt personally attacked, at least initially. And while he told me that he recognized that you were just messing with him and that he was over it, he is most certainly not over it.<br><br>I get what was going on. From your perspective, you were messing with him in a friendly way because of the running joke that you&#39;ll do anything to defend elves. I&#39;d just like an apology so that he knows you respect him. Show him the Huinesoron I knew when I recruited him. Okay?<br><br>Thank you!<br>-Twistey</p>

            <p>My intention was to encapsulate a factcheck-of-sorts in a story, and to find a way to include Willis in a &#39;shipfic&#39; without shipping him with anyone other than you (it being the Shipfest and all). However, I can see that I failed spectacularly at conveying that, and can understand how you (both) saw it differently. So: sorry.<br><br>If it helps to settle Willis&#39; mind, I&#39;ll note that the only reason I wrote him being a bit intimidated is that, well, 7-foot strangers standing over you <i>is</i> intimidating, and not acknowledging that would be planting a huge elephant in the room. I wrote him as being as unintimidating as he could (like I said before, he&#39;s socially inept), but clearly failed in my goal, so again: sorry.<br><br>I hope this public callout-and-apology will help set Willis&#39; mind at ease.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>It&#39;s not really necessary though. I overreacted to your joke and was going to just let it slide, but Twistey thought it would be good to voice my concerns. I&#39;m just not in a very good place emotionally currently, so I&#39;m exaggerating everything that could possibly be seen as bad, which is why it made me feel bad. Just to clarify though, it wasn&#39;t that my stand-in was being intimidated, it was that I was portrayed as being a weak and socially incompetent child.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m sorry. Your concerns were misrepresented, and I reacted to a flawed understanding of your feelings.<br><br>However, I&#39;m more sorry you opted into the Shipfest at all to begin with. It&#39;s clear that you have trouble separating yourself from fictional (mis)representations of yourself. That&#39;s a skill we do expect people to learn, particularly in the context of fanfiction, which often includes fictional representations of the author—but it takes practice. If you&#39;re not there yet, and if you weren&#39;t in a great place emotionally on top of it, a game that specifically involves a (mis)representation of you using your own screenname rather than a distinct character&#39;s name was no place for you.<br><br>I don&#39;t <i>know</i> this happened, but given your obvious reluctance and reservations about the whole thing, let me say this: if—that&#39;s <i>if</i>—Twistey prodded you into it at all, that was wrong of her, and you guys will have to work that out between yourselves.<br><br>If not, good.

            <p>The thing is resolved. It didn&#39;t even really need to be resolved. I know, and acknowledged, that it was just a joke that I overreacted to. End of story. I opted in with those rather tight restrictions because I didn&#39;t know what was going to happen, but I thought it might be fun to participate in a limited way. But the fact that I did doesn&#39;t make me a bad person. I was just attempting to have a bit of fun like everyone else. Now can we drop his issue?

            <p>I just want to make sure that everyone understands that neither Agent nor Boarder hS was actually doing anything to deliberately intimidate anyone else. The point of the ficlet was simply that Willis had his facts about elves misplaced, so an elf agent came along to set him straight.

            <p>The way that you phrased this gives the impression that you think that my emotions and opinions are invalid and wrong in this situation. I am fully aware that it was made for entertainment purposes only, and I don&#39;t/didn&#39;t want an apology about anything, but I couldn&#39;t help feeling when I initially read the story that it was a veiled way to put me down, and that I had been portrayed in a bad way in the story. I know that wasn&#39;t the intention, but it still made me feel that way, and the fact that it was meant to be funny doesn&#39;t invalidate my feelings about it. I don&#39;t have enough experience with the Board or hS to know what either are really like, so I didn&#39;t have any way to accurately interpret the situation. So I&#39;m sorry that this happened, but it&#39;s not anybody&#39;s fault.</p>

            <p>However, I&#39;d like a few things to be cleared up before I get started:<br><br>- Neither I nor Willis misinterpreted what hS did. We got that it was a joke. That does not change how it felt. And while Willis sort of assumed the worst from hS, I didn&#39;t. That&#39;s why I put this out in the open, because I believed it would help, whereas he thought that he&#39;d just be mass-targeted in reply. By <i>all</i> the Boarders. I was not kidding about the bad taste in his mouth.<br><br>- Speaking of assuming, very bold of you to predict what I am going to do next! What if your prediction had not been correct? You would be the one assuming worse!<br><br>Now that we have that out of the way, first things first.<br><br>When I am emotionally vulnerable after having done something pretty wrong, and have made myself even more vulnerable by apologizing for my actions instead of running and hiding, I do not appreciate my apology being outright dismissed for being less than perfect. It makes me feel like I am not forgiven for my actions and like I have lost others&#39; trust. Which is a terrible feeling.<br><br>When I am concerned, confused, or bothered by something and I voice my feelings, I do not appreciate having them dismissed as me needing to lighten up or stop questioning things. Let me remind you that &quot;questioning things&quot; is also how we try to do things, as you yourself said in response to my comment about the Star Wars prequels. Being dismissed makes me feel like I and my opinions and feelings don&#39;t matter. Which is also a terrible feeling.<br><br>And I definitely don&#39;t appreciate my age being guessed incorrectly. I&#39;ll have you know that when I was thirteen, I was <i>worse</i>. What you basically did was personally attack me and call me immature. Perhaps you should make fewer bold assumptions about your opponents in general, and let them have their say first.<br><br>I get that I need to change. I really do, especially if I ever want to visit Germany. But it will take time. I cannot just &quot;drop it&quot;. And that is why I will be merciful to you, because I know you cannot simply &quot;drop&quot; a behavior either. If you would like to, you and I may in fact join together as compatriots in breaking bad habits - a tried-and-true method.<br><br>I would like an apology and I would like evidence that you understand what I am saying and where I am coming from. And then I would like you to work towards being more compassionate and, dare I say, peaceful. Don&#39;t take it personally, no matter how attacked this no doubt makes you feel. I see where you&#39;re coming from with these things and I believe in your ability to get better.<br><br>Thanks,<br>-Twistey</p>

            <p>Neither is it a debate, so I won&#39;t argue with your various points of accusation.<br><br>Here&#39;s what I will do:<br><br>1. I will apologize for being condescending. I was, and I should have expressed myself better. I&#39;m sorry.<br><br>2. I will take you out of the category &quot;child&quot; in my head and think of you instead as &quot;teen or young adult.&quot;<br><br>3. I&#39;ll now take off the kid gloves and tell you in frank language what that means.<br><br>That means my patience for you treating Nazis, Hitler, the Holocaust, and other related concepts as fun playthings ends as of this post. I am not comfortable with it, and I don&#39;t want to see it in PPC spaces anymore.<br><br>It means I expect you to understand that trivializing things that have hurt and <i>are hurting people to this day</i> is not okay, and that no one here is obliged to tolerate it—not when Neo-Nazi and other white supremacist terrorism is a global problem and people are being killed in its name. Your feelings are not more important than those of the people being persecuted in the name of the discriminatory ideals espoused by the Nazi party and its leaders, and I will not apologize for saying so.<br><br>It means I expect you to exercise the ability of a teen or young adult to moderate your actions, and to stop bringing those things up in any way, shape, or form. That includes <i>Wolfenstein</i> and other media that features Hitler, Nazis, Holocaust, etc. You will keep your fascination with those things strictly to yourself from now on.<br><br>It means that if you don&#39;t stop, I will consider it a violation of Article 3 of the Constitution, and I will call upon the Board to make a decision about how to handle it.<br><br>I hope I have been sufficiently clear.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>We’re all still learning here. Some of us more than others. *gestures exaggeratedly at self*<br><br>I think that to better preserve your peace of mind, I may end up doing one of the following things, ranked from least to most drastic and least to most effective:<br>- Using my upcoming spring break as an excuse to get away and detox both me and all of you. (Well, that’s going to happen no matter what, but I could also do either of the following...)<br>- Not migrating to our new discussion site when we get one, and just hanging around here until yourwebapps shuts down. At that point, you can consider me a purely historical entity of the PPC.<br>- Using my upcoming break as an excuse to become a purely historical entity of the PPC. I’m not really considering this one too seriously.<br><br>I’m also likely going to start my own sporking group on Newgrounds for Willis to migrate to, as he’s probably a little too emotionally vulnerable to stay here. This group will also house all the friends that I would recruit except they have an even worse sense of offensiveness than me. (Scary!) And possibly some of the stuff that I can’t post here, since Newgrounds’ target market is in fact quasi-insensitive youth such as me (their logo is a tank, for crying out loud.) So if it comes into existence and if I ever plug it with a big content warning on it, don’t think of me as a traitor or trying to avoid making personal change, because that’s just where I’ll be going to dump my garbage.<br><br>-Twistey<br>P.S. On an even lighter note: Since a lot of people had fun with the military tactics aspect of Ship War, I had the best idea for how to bring back a “safer” version that kinda combines with the Badfic Game. Tell me how you like this: A group of hilariously petty Suethors leading nations of Mary Sues against each other. :D I give you full permission to use it if I happen to be gone by next year.</p>

            <p>Nazism is not an intellectually interesting historical trivium, nor is it a game.

            <p>Are you trying to call me racist? I do not support any actual racism. There is a difference between being an edgelord (someone who obsesses with dark/taboo things just because of the shock value, or thinks they’re being cool) and being a racist (someone who genuinely believes that their race is superior to others).

            <p>I am respectfully going to reply anyway, because I think this is an important conversation.<br><br>It wouldn&#39;t be for me to comment on whether you&#39;re racist; my hunch, and certainly my hope, is that you aren&#39;t, but your thoughts belong to you. My concern is that your actions normalise and trivialise a narrative which makes things easier for people who are racist. Your intentions don&#39;t have to be bad for your actions to cause harm.<br><br>I understand the distinction you&#39;ve drawn between edgelords and racists. I agree there is a line between--also aware that it&#39;s a easy step across. I wouldn&#39;t at all like to see you leave the PPC; my preferred option is that you stay, really think about the feedback you&#39;ve had about this issue, and take advantage of an environment that will support you if you want to step away from the edginess.<br><br>If I didn&#39;t think it was important and you were worth the investment of time, I certainly wouldn&#39;t have bothered--my lurking skills are finely honed over the last 15 years, and it takes a lot to stir me from my slumber.
