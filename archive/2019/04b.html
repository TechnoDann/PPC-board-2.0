            <p>This morning/last night, Zdimensia posted attempting to take me up on the offer I made <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=316858;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">in this post</a>. Despite the fact that her recent activity has been a massive violation of the principle of &#39;one more post&#39;, I engaged with her by email to see if we could still do so.<br><br>Over the course of the day, it became clear that Zdimensia was unwilling or unable to abide by any of the conditions laid out in the original post.<br><br>-She was not willing to promise that at the end of the discussion she would leave the PPC alone, but stated that this would only happen if it came to a &#39;satisfactory conclusion&#39;.<br>-She was not willing/able to give her entire message at once; the 3000-word document she gave me was labelled &#39;Part 1&#39;. I intentionally waived this requirement.<br>-She was not willing to abide by the conditions that her only comments be answers to direct questions or corrections of misunderstandings. She wanted to be able to argue and vocally disagree with anything I said, which is precisely what the deal was intended to forestall.<br><br>What I was offering was to let her state her position, to give her a fair hearing, and to present her with my conclusions. What she wants is a debate, or an argument. These are not the same thing.<br><br>I never had any hope that the deal would lead to Zdimensia and I agreeing on every point; however, it is clear that she would only consider herself bound by the &#39;the last time&#39; condition if she was permitted to ignore the others, <b>and</b> absolute agreement was reached.<br><br>That may be something someone else wishes to attempt; I am not. Therefore, as of this afternoon, I <b>retract the offer</b>. I spent all day replying to emails, trying to get her to agree to the conditions laid out a year ago as a prerequisite for the deal she said she wanted to take; I refuse to do so again.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I&#39;m sorry you went through such a frustrating night.  It isn&#39;t fair that you got saddled with the responsibility when you already do so much for this community.<br><br>So even though you weren&#39;t able to work things out, thank you for taking the time and energy to try and reach a conclusion to all this.

            <p>Since I&#39;m writing my first Mission for <em>Fire Emblem</em> and I was unsure about a couple things about the Minis for this continuum, I wanted to bring it to the Board for discussion.<br><br>Aside from the obvious, would misspelled class names count?<br>I checked with the <em>Fire Emblem</em> Missions already out, which don&#39;t mention them, and I can&#39;t remember off-hand if they&#39;re ever mentioned in the dialogue of the games themselves. Still, they&#39;re important enough that I thought it prudent to bring up.<br><br>And my second point of contention: should the Minis switch over from Dragons to Wyverns?<br>The last time I posted about <em>Fire Emblem</em> Minis, the general consensus was to go for Wyverns. Is that still the case?</p>
