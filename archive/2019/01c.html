            <p>It would also make sense timeline-wise: if the colonists were going to name anything &#39;the Pernese Alps&#39;, it would be the big mountain range they first settled on. (Of course, if they were American, they&#39;d probably be the Pernese Rockies, with Benden being in the Pernese Appalachians.)<br><br>I did think very much of you when deciding to post it. ;) Sadly I think the base image is a bit low res to be worth printing out, and I can&#39;t find a better version.

            <p>I needed something with layers that I could access <s>at work</s> from an undisclosed location, and I&#39;d at least heard of it, so. The reason they&#39;re so small is that it was all done with the standard paintbrush - any larger and you&#39;d start seeing block-filled areas, which never look good. ^_^<br><br>I don&#39;t think yours is as bad as you think. The saucer works very well in the sky, just as the TARDIS does on the beach; the sea and sky go together well too. The tree is kind of jarring, but silver leaves, right? I&#39;m sure I remember Eight going on about silver leaves.<br><br>You&#39;ve got a few artefacts around the islands, but the easiest way to eliminate those would be to shrink the image slightly. ;) After that, I&#39;d mostly be looking at the shadows - under a burnt orange sky, I think they&#39;d take a different colour to standard black. I would say highlights as well (eg, on the leaves), but if the Doctor says they&#39;re silver, that must mean they appear silver even under Gallifreyan light, so that works.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Five years ago today, I wandered here via TV Tropes after reading the Original Series. I introduced myself on someone else&#39;s thread, accidentally used my own email address as a username on my own introductory thread, and proceeded to make a fool of myself while accepting everyone&#39;s newbie gifts. (I still have that potato cannon, by the way; I just need to find a reason to use it.)<br><br>Back then I was still going by RinaAndRanda (Rina) and... well, a few months after that, I switched to Iximaz and I&#39;ve been going by it ever since.<br><br>Hard to believe I was just a little baby sixteen year old at the time. My twenty-second birthday is in a few months now, I&#39;ve gotten engaged, I&#39;ve moved to a new country... amazing to think what can happen in five years.<br><br>You guys are the best online group I&#39;ve ever had the pleasure to be a part of.

            <p>Tiger staggered down the corridor. The dizziness spell Martin had put on him meant he couldn’t walk in a straight line, which was the whole point. <br><br>When Martin had first told him to pretend to be drunk in order to spy on the girls, Tiger had thought it was a very bad joke. But it appeared he was serious. To Tiger, it was self-evidently a completely horrendous idea, because the girls weren’t stupid and they knew he wasn’t stupid.<br><br>He didn’t have much choice: it was either obey orders or launch a leadership challenge, which was also a horrendous idea: Martin was three years older and stronger than Tiger and dividing the group in half would be handing victory to the girls.<br><br>Which was why Tiger was now trying to act as stupidly as possible. He banged into the wall. “Stupid wall!” he slurred. “Take that!” He kicked the wall. “And that! And that!” He kicked it with the other foot and then punched it, trying to keep a straight face.<br><br>His toes actually hurt now. That was going to leave a bruise, probably. He continued along the corridor, stumbling and wobbling on his clumsy feet, until finally he reached the end and the girl sitting on the plastic chair. He recognised her as Penelope Turner, who was in the same year as him.<br><br>“What’s the password?” she asked, although she looked extremely confused.<br><br>“Pashword?” Tiger asked. “I don’t need no pashword!” He swung his fist in a clumsy blow he normally would have scorned.<br><br>Penelope, of course, dodged it without any difficulty whatsoever. She turned her head to the door behind her, opened it a crack, and called “Tiger Moon’s here! And… I think he’s drunk?”<br><br>Tiger forced open the door and stepped inside. “Die!” he shouted, stomping towards the nearest girl and drawing his sword.<br><br>For the next few minutes the scene resembled one from a comedy. Tiger stepped towards the girls clunkily and made half-hearted attacks which were all easily dodged. He fought the urge to burst out laughing. <br><br>Eventually the girls managed to organise themselves and he was surrounded by a wall of raised swords. Normally, facing these impossible odds, Tiger would take the sensible option and surrender, but being “drunk” he couldn’t do that. He charged towards one of the oldest girls there and was immediately hit by a Halting Spell, completely taking away his ability to move.<br><br>Well, that was stages one and two of the plan, “pretend to be drunk” and “get captured”, successful. Now all he had to do was spy. And hopefully not have to endure his sister’s evil gloating.<br></p>

            <p>Today, Steven Universe has aired their season five finale, Battle of Heart and Mind. An hour long special, this episode puts an end to this long, emotional season full of twists, turns, metaphors and head-scratching lore implacations. I know many of you at least casually watch the show, and I was curious as to your thoughts. How did you like it? What do you feel about certain revelations? Is Peridot best gem? I truly want to know your thoughts, if you would care to share them.</p>

            <p>(Just adding this to an existing review thread so I don&#39;t bump all the new threads that went up in the last twenty-four hours.  Hope you don&#39;t mind, World-Jumper!)<br><br>I remember for certain I watched the film adaptation of this back in high school AP Biology.  I don’t remember why we watched it in a biology class, and I also don’t remember, uh, nearly anything from the movie.  But when I saw a battered copy of <i>Contact</i> in a Goodwill, I decided it was time to add it to my list of known canons.<br><br>Spoilers for <i>Contact</i>.<br><br>I actually don’t know a whole lot about Carl Sagan beyond “scientist” and “writer.”  From my perspective reading <i>Contact</i> in the 2010s, it feels like an alternate history, though of course, it was a speculative future when Sagan published it in 1985.  And as a result . . . well, I feel sad that neither U.S. nor global culture has lived up to Sagan’s vision.  Sagan presents a world with the U.S. has finally elected a woman to the presidency, where nuclear weapons are being scaled back, where space flight and exploration are becoming more and more commonplace, where the human species is becoming more of an identity than any national identity.  It makes me feel like I’m living in the more backwards Earth.  I hope things get closer to Sagan’s vision during my lifetime, but right now, I’m a bit pessimistic about the motivating power of human selfishness and fear.<br><br>I’m having trouble ordering my thoughts about the idea of our species meeting a sentient one from another planet.  Given my very <i>Kingdom Hearts</i>- and PPC-inspired outlook on life, I would personally love for our cultures to meet another and start to see a very different and unique outlook on life.  But I’m not sure our species is ready for that; we’re not very good at accepting each other yet, so I feel like the encounter with an entire new species is just going to lead to a whole new variety of racism.  And depending on the beliefs and culture of the other new species, that may get us involved in a conflict we don’t have any way of surviving.<br><br>Mmm.  I guess this isn’t much of a review, but I’m struggling to fins more to say.  Anyone else have thoughts on this novel, or its movie?<br><br>—doctorlit, being mopey about culture<br><br>“Except only for a nearby supernova remnant in Cassiopeia, it was the brightest spoiler source in the skies of Earth.” “Except only for a nearby supernova remnant in Cassiopeia, it was the brightest spoiler source in the skies of Earth.”</p>

            <p>I have no idea why I messed up the title of the episode. Oops.<br><br>I have been sitting on my thoughts about this episode. I feel like I will need to ruminate and process even more to truly wrap my mind around it. It definitely was... Intense. To summarize my thoughts without spoilers, I really enjoyed what I saw, but can&#39;t help but feel... Disappointed? No, that&#39;s way too strong of a word. More... conflicted about certain plot points, that I&#39;m not sure is fair to be conflicted about. Still, a beautifully animated episode of television that thrilled me from start to finish. If you are at all invested in Steven Universe, I not only recommend it but recommend going in as blindly as you can.<br><br>Now, for my thoughts that require a bit more detail, and with it, spoilers.<br><br><b>THIS IS YOUR SPOILER WARNING. SERIOUSLY, IT&#39;S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT YOU JUST WATCH THE EPISODE SPOILER FREE. I DON&#39;T NORMALLY SAY THAT, SO KNOW THAT I&#39;M SERIOUS.</b><br><br>&quot;It&#39;s over, isn&#39;t it?<br> Isn&#39;t it?<br> Isn&#39;t it over?&quot;<br><br>This episode feels like a series finale. In all likelihood, it isn&#39;t. There is a movie confirmed for release sometime in the fall, and I think there was confirmation of a sixth season, though I can&#39;t find it. Yet, it still feels like a finale, not just to season five, but the show as a whole. The Diamonds are beginning to heal as a family unit, and become more open-minded about those who are different. Steven has finally accepted that he is not Rose Quartz the rebel, nor Pink Diamond the dictator. He is, truly, Steven. Just Seven.  We even have the corrupted gems of Earth, the greatest regret of Rose Quartz, finally healed. There are a few open spots in our understanding of the universe, but as far as the story of Steven Universe, the artistic point of the series, every single plotline is closed. Where could we possibly go from here?<br><br>I have been stewing on this episode for a while. As much happened throughout that merits discussion, such as the exploration of a broken family through the Diamonds, or the dangers of perfectionism shown through White Diamond, or just how slick the new gem designs are, (My favorite is Lapis. Love the Atlantian, Greco-roman thing she has now) There is one moment that I just can&#39;t get past, and have been ruminating on this whole time.<br><br>&quot;You won and she chose you,<br>And she loved you and <i>she&#39;s gone.</i>&quot;<br><br>Pink Diamond is dead. Rose Quartz is dead. The personality that once inhabited the pink diamond gemstone is completely overwritten by that of Steven. In the climax of the episode, White Diamond pulled out the gemstone from Steven&#39;s body, demanding Pink Diamond re-form and stop lying about who she is. Yet, when the construct emerges from the diamond, it is not in the shape of Pink Diamond. It is not in the shape of Rose Quartz. Instead, we see Steven. The first shot is a split-screen perspective, showing White Diamond&#39;s room from human!Steven&#39;s eyes. He is weak and drained. He can&#39;t even stand, with all the energy taken from him. He may even be dying. Eventually, from the other side of the screen, which has been blurry and grey for now, is from the eyes of the pink projection from the gemstone. Here, it cannot be more clear. Steven and his gem are two halves of the whole system. If you were to describe him as a fusion, then it is a fusion in the same way the various cells in your body have fused together to make the organism that is you. Yet, just in case the audience had any lingering doubt, White Diamond insists that Pink stops messing around and turn back into her proper form, the way she <i>should</i> look. And what does gem!Steven say in response?<br><br><a href="https://youtu.be/xB4MZt1mDWM?t=10">SHE&#39;S GONE!</a><br><br>My mind reeled at this. Throughout the series, we had little hints that Rose was inside the gemstone, sleeping perhaps, protecting Steven subconsciously, but there. Dreams that were more than simple memories, but packed with symbolism and warning. There were moments you could practically hear her voice alongside Steven&#39;s as if she spoke, if not through him, then at least alongside him. Like the recursive Pearl&#39;s deep within her psyche, I thought that, if Steven were to dig deep enough, he might finally have that long-awaited conversation with his mother. He might, for once, get answers from the source. Perhaps, just share a hug. I never wanted Rose or Pink back for real, not a permanent character or anything, but to simply know that she&#39;s there. For the chance at that mother-son heart to heart, I&#39;ve wanted for so long.<br><br>&quot;SHE&#39;S <b>GONE!</b>&quot;<br><br>There is no more Pink Diamond. At most, all that&#39;s left are fragments of memories. Tiny bits of what once was, but truly is no more. If we are to use a hard drive as a metaphor, the gemstone that stored Pink Diamond the person was reconfigured, wiped clean for the new Steven. There may be lingering pieces of code, but nothing concrete, nothing that you could call a full file.  To say I was taken aback is an understatement. In a world with this much magic, with the ability for the dead to walk again, with whole different persons within persons, to have Steven&#39;s mother be actually, truly, for real gone, with no possibility of ever re-surfacing... It hit me like a ton of bricks. I staggered back just as White Diamond did.<br><br>Thinking more on it, I don&#39;t know what I expected. The show has said this much the entire time. &quot;Steven, <b>we can&#39;t both exist.</b> I&#39;m going to become half of you. And I need you to know that every moment you love being yourself, that&#39;s <i>me</i>, loving you and loving <i>being</i> you. Because you&#39;re going to be something extraordinary. You&#39;re going to be a human being.&quot;<br><br>Yet, with all of the little hints of a person inside him, to have all that storytelling potential just <i>gone?</i> I felt robbed. Yet, in a way, isn&#39;t that what losing a parent is like? Why death hurts so much? Everybody has further stories they can tell. Everybody has questions that only they can answer. Yet, one day, they will be gone. And there&#39;s no amount of meditation, or seances, or wishing, or begging, or pleading that&#39;s going to bring them back. You want to go back and talk to them one last time. You try to see the little pieces of them inside their descendants. You want to have just one last moment. One last time to say, &quot;I love you.&quot;<br><br>But you can&#39;t.<br><br>She&#39;s gone.<br><br>Forever.<br><br>And you have to learn to deal with that.<br><br>I have more thoughts on this episode, and I look forward to discussing them with you all. This is a heavy episode with a lot of meaning crammed into it. I chose to interpret this sequence as the final nail in Pink Diamond&#39;s coffin. Others have interpreted this as a metaphor for a trans individual confronting their past and abusive, close-minded family. But for now, that&#39;s all I have to say.<br><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoBGAzY0JGQ">If I could begin to be, Half of what you think of me, I could do about anything, I could even learn how to love...</a></p>

Did I just hear you say you&#39;re the... oldest agent?&quot;<br><br>&quot;One hundred and ten today!&quot; Doctor Cornelius confirmed, his chest puffing up under his beard. &quot;Well, probably today - this place is a nightmare for timelines, you know.&quot;<br><br>&quot;You don&#39;t look a day over 90,&quot; the agent said with a smile. &quot;But I don&#39;t think that makes you the oldest agent, I&#39;m afraid.&quot;<br><br>&quot;What?!&quot; If the doctor had swelled up before, he now seemed fit to burst. &quot;I haven&#39;t given my life to the PPC just so I can be dismissed by-&quot;<br><br>&quot;Nonono!&quot; The agent threw up her hands. &quot;No dismissing, promise! It&#39;s just that, well, there <i>are</i> agents quite a bit older than you.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Nonsense,&quot; Doctor Cornelius puffed. &quot;Why, I daresay you couldn&#39;t show me a single one!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Um.&quot; The agent tapped the arm of the taller woman next to her. &quot;Selene? I think that&#39;s your cue.&quot;<br><br>The second agent put down her glass - which, Lorelei noted, was filled with a <i>very</i> red liquid - and turned. &quot;Selene Morgana Lilith Perdita X Windflower,&quot; she said, nodding to the doctor. &quot;I think what Kaitlyn wants me to say is that I&#39;m nearly...&quot; She stopped, glancing at said partner. &quot;You&#39;re just going to correct me if I bend the truth, aren&#39;t you?&quot;<br><br>&quot;That&#39;s what I&#39;m here for,&quot; Kaitlyn agreed, grinning.<br><br>&quot;Fine.&quot; Selene pushed a lock of hair back from her face, her fingers brushing over the brasswork implanted there. &quot;Then I&#39;m a little over two hundred and fifty.&quot; She looked at the doctor&#39;s reddening face, glanced away. &quot;Like you say, precise calculations are tricky around here.&quot;<br><br>&quot;You think <i>you</i> have it bad?&quot; A third woman (who, Lorelei noticed, had black hair just like Kaitlyn and Selene - she was starting to feel left out) ambled over. &quot;I&#39;ve spent half my life roaming around the time vortex, I can&#39;t even get my age to within a <i>decade</i>.&quot; She swung down into an empty chair and took a swig of her drink. &quot;I&#39;ve been &#39;about four hundred&#39; since I joined the PPC.&quot;<br><br>Selene nodded to the newcomer. &quot;Agent Morgan,&quot; she said. &quot;My partner&#39;s... I think she&#39;s trying to make her new friend here feel young.&quot; She frowned slightly, pursing her lips. &quot;Or she&#39;s just nitpicking. Hard to tell.&quot;<br><br>Morgan snorted. &quot;If it&#39;s young you want, you should come visit the Continuity Council,&quot; she said. &quot;Dis and the Agent won&#39;t tell me how old they actually are, but I know it&#39;s up around a thousand.&quot; Her lip twitched into a smile. &quot;And Grey definitely <i>should</i> be twice that, even if she isn&#39;t.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Oh, I think we can do better than that.&quot; Kaitlyn got to her feet, then clambered onto her chair and waved vigorously. &quot;Hey! Huinesoron! You&#39;re needed!&quot;<br><br>She slid back down into her seat and looked around at the others. &quot;What? I needed him.&quot;<br><br>A tall elf (whose brown hair was so dark it was almost - sigh - black) wove his way between the tables towards them. &quot;Kaitlyn,&quot; he said, a hint of wariness in his face. &quot;I&#39;m guessing you&#39;re not about to offer me a drink.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Maybe in a minute,&quot; Kaitlyn said, grabbing his hand and pulling him over. &quot;Doctor Cornelius, this is Huinesoron, from over in DOGA. He&#39;s just celebrated his two thousand, six hundred and twentieth birthday.&quot;<br><br>&quot;That&#39;s not-&quot; Huinesoron shook his head. &quot;That&#39;s just an estimate,&quot; he assured the doctor, &quot;and it&#39;s not actually my birthday-&quot;<br><br>&quot;Might be,&quot; Kaitlyn said stubbornly. &quot;Anyway, I reckon that makes you older than anyone.&quot;<br><br>Huinesoron tilted his head to the side. &quot;Gurnirel and Naergondir over in SIELU might be older,&quot; he said. &quot;They were born before me, we&#39;re pretty sure, but I waited longer to join the Protectors, so...&quot;<br><br>&quot;And you can&#39;t say older than <i>anyone</i>,&quot; Morgan put in. &quot;The Guardsman - over in Internal Affairs? - has definitely topped four thousand.&quot;<br><br>&quot;There&#39;s a draeni in Bad Slash who&#39;s passed eight,&quot; Selene proffered. &quot;And I think- Kaitlyn, what are you doing?&quot;<br><br>Kaitlyn continued tapping at her communicator. &quot;Oh, you <i>know</i> what I&#39;m doing.&quot;<br><br>&quot;... please don&#39;t.&quot; Selene&#39;s fingers rapped on the tabletop. &quot;Come on, Kaitlyn, there&#39;s no need to-&quot;<br><br>A portal opened between the tables, and a (yep) black-haired elf stepped out. &quot;Priestess,&quot; he said, nodding to Kaitlyn. &quot;Huinesoron. ... Selene.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Dafydd.&quot; Selene looked steadfastly down at her drink. &quot;Hi.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Given that I&#39;ve been summoned to a bar,&quot; Dafydd Illian said, looking around, &quot;I&#39;m going to assume &#39;dire emergency&#39; is code for &#39;come have a drink.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Well, you&#39;re welcome to,&quot; Kaitlyn said, &quot;but there really <i>is</i> an emergency. We&#39;re arguing about who the oldest agent is.&quot;<br><br>Dafydd arched an eyebrow. &quot;I&#39;m not an agent any more.&quot;<br><br>&quot;You still count.&quot; Kaitlyn flicked her fingers towards him. &quot;Come on, I remember your speech to the Grey Lady. &#39;I was born two thousand years before the Sun rose, and have lived through six Ages of-&#39;&quot;<br><br>&quot;I can&#39;t believe you still know that.&quot; Dafydd didn&#39;t quite wince. &quot;It comes to 15,000 years, give or take.&quot; He glanced around the group, taking in Huinesoron (looking slightly awestruck), Morgan (slightly impressed), and Doctor Cornelius (slightly sick). &quot;Do I win?&quot;<br><br>&lt;&lt;Er...&gt;&gt;<br><br>A hazy form coalesced above the table, taking on roughly humanoid shape. It didn&#39;t really have enough detail to show hair colour, which at this point, Lorelei was happy to call a win. The group reacted with varying degrees of confusion, except for Morgan, who nodded politely, and Dafydd, who waved a greeting.<br><br>&quot;Fëamintë,&quot; he said, smiling. &quot;What brings you here?&quot;<br><br>&lt;&lt;Your wife sent me,&gt;&gt; the Maia formerly known as Agent Vemi said. &lt;&lt;Something about running out on her?&gt;&gt;<br><br>&quot;She said there was an emergency,&quot; Dafydd pointed out, gesturing at Kaitlyn. &quot;I&#39;d never turn down an opportunity like that.&quot;<br><br>&lt;&lt;She said something about chopping onions,&gt;&gt; Fëamintë noted. &lt;&lt;You should probably get back. But.&gt;&gt;<br><br>Dafydd looked abruptly wary. &quot;But?&quot;<br><br>&lt;&lt;But I was created ere Arda was sung,&gt;&gt; the Maia said softly, &lt;&lt;and walked with Oromë until we fought for the Children at Utumno.&gt;&gt; She held up one glowing hand, fingers outstretched. &lt;&lt;Time had little meaning in the ages of Lamps and Trees, but even by conservative estimate, that makes me over 44,000 Years of the Sun in age.&gt;&gt; She looked around the group, her eyes glowing with pale fire. &lt;&lt;I think that means <i>I</i> win.&gt;&gt;<br><br>Dafydd chewed on his lip, then sighed and nodded. Most of the others looked on in awe or confusion-<br><br>-except for Doctor Cornelius, who rose to his feet with a face like thunder. &quot;You can&#39;t do this to me!&quot; he declared. &quot;I don&#39;t have to take this! <i>I was the sixteenth agent, you know!</i>&quot;<br><br><hr>

            <p>Unless he means the oldest still around.<br><br>That was a fun read.<br><br>...And also really weird to know Ari might be the oldest listed agent on the wiki considering that she&#39;s <i>young</i> for a draenei. Prophet Velen is confirmed to be over 25,000 years old (since that&#39;s how long ago he took the draenei and fled their home planet) and was likely already fairly old before that happened, seeing as how he was one of the leaders of his people...

            <p>The longest-serving agent in the PPC is of course Makes-Things, followed by Osbert (who was the fourth agent; Elizabeth and Anya are both dead). Doctor Cornelius is, as he frequently reminds everyone, the sixteenth - which is respectable, but there&#39;s several still around from before him. He&#39;s older than all of them, though - he has at least 20 years on Osbert, for instance.<br><br>Now, whether he actually <i>meant</i> to claim to be oldest, age-wise, or whether he just slipped up (he&#39;s 110, after all) and refused to go back on it, is still entirely up for debate. ^_^<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>The actual current oldest <i>agent</i> is still to play for. My quick Wiki trawl didn&#39;t turn up anyone older than Ix&#39;s Arinellya, but there&#39;s enough literal immortals - organic or machine - in the multiverse that I wouldn&#39;t be at all surprised if we had one.<br><br>Come to think of it, Agent Thoth is &#39;several thousand&#39;, which earns him second place on the current list (ahead of the Guardsman, but after Arinellya). Chliever is non-canon, but about the same age.<br><br>Who else? Mel, Endomiel, and Ril-gania are DMFF agents of undefined age, but <i>may</i> be as old as Middle-earth in their own story, so ~54,000. Not confirmed, though. Rashida is 2400+, putting her on a par with Huinesoron and Zing&#39;s Caliquendi.<br><br>Discounting Mel and her sisters (they&#39;re out-and-out Suvians, and definitely don&#39;t act like they&#39;ve been around since the start of time), my top 10 list of confirmed oldest active agents is:<br><br>1 Arinyella: ~8000 years<br>2 Thoth: Probably 5000-10000.<br>3 Guardsman: 4156.<br>4&amp;5 Gurnirel &amp; Naergondir: ~2700.<br>6 Huinesoron: 2620.<br>7 Rashida: 2400<br>8&amp;9 The Agent &amp; The Disentangler: 1000+<br>10 The Notary: 682.<br><br>After that there&#39;s a <i>lot</i> of people in the 200-400 range, who&#39;ll be night-impossible to sort out. And to be honest, all of the &#39;generic elf&#39; types are probably 3000-odd - there don&#39;t seem to have been many elves born in the Third Age. But for actual hard numbers, that&#39;s what I&#39;ve got. :)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I have no idea how old Jenni is. ^_^; If you&#39;re only counting years spent incarnate (that I can account for), I&#39;d guess she lands on the upper end of that 200-400 range? There are a few full, long lifetimes I&#39;m aware of, and a much larger number of instances where she just showed up fully formed, hung around for a bit, and then presumably <s>got bored</s> finished what she was doing and left.<br><br>&#39;Course, in her home universe, she&#39;s existed since the beginning of time, and we pick up with humanity around a medieval-to-renaissance level of development, so...<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>At this point, specifically - I&#39;d think non-continuous lifetimes would mostly count if she can look back on all of them. If they&#39;re alternate versions that don&#39;t overlap with current-Jenni, I&#39;m not sure they would.<br><br>&#39;The beginning of time&#39; is a tricky one.

            <p>I think it would make the most sense to only count time that can actually be contextualized with the physical reality of the world she (and her two brothers) are involved with, so we&#39;re looking more at geological time than cosmic time... and, actually, let&#39;s narrow it down further than that. I&#39;m gonna go ahead and say, for the sake of argument, that the ability of the PTBs to conceptualize themselves as individuals has evolved more or less at the same rate as humanity&#39;s ability to conceptualize itself as a species, so we don&#39;t have to count all the time the PTBs spent as an amorphous, loosely defined &quot;we&quot; with no concern for or even perception of linear time. They&#39;ve existed as distinct individual personalities with their own agendas concerning the material plane for (*checks Wikipedia*) something like 50,000 to 130,000 years.<br><br>I reckon Jenni&#39;s the middle child, so call her 90,000 years old?

            <p>She thought but did not say, because it would make most people uncomfortable, that they definitely sounded like siblings. Instead, she said: &quot;That&#39;ll happen when you&#39;re just alike enough for the differences to be really annoying. Funny how that works, isn&#39;t it?

            <p>Jenni sipped her drink a moment, thinking many things. For one, Powers forbid she should ever meet a clone or alternative version of herself. She wasn&#39;t sure it was even possible—what she was obliged to describe as other lives in other worlds had all happened to <i>her</i>, just under variant conditions. Currently, conditions allowed her to remember all of them, even the ones that explicitly had <i>not</i> happened to anyone else involved, and she could even put most of them in a linear order if pressed. The idea of a version of herself that was both <i>her</i> and yet also <i>other</i> was profoundly disturbing in a way that she hadn&#39;t expected. She just couldn&#39;t rationalize it for herself in the way that a strictly linear, strictly material being could.<br><br>&quot;Well, Jacques is definitely not you,&quot; she declared, &quot;nor vice versa, and neither of you is Jack Harkness.

            <p>Inside the FicPsych nurse&#39;s affairs with multiple Jack Harkness replacements—and the canon himself! (page 11)<br><br><br>Nurse Jennifer Robinson&#39;s sordid past is hardly a secret among those who follow the <i>Monitor</i>&#39;s reportings, but recently she has begun taking things to new heights. After allegedly kidnapping Captain Jack Harkness himself for a coffee date and a night of rough sex, the naughty nurse has gone on a collecting spree among HQ&#39;s Harkness look-alikes.<br><br>First there was none other than Jacques Bonnefoy (ESAS), a dashing man with a voice like an angel&#39;s. Formerly a Sue&#39;s object of desire, it seems he has found a new Sue upon which he can shower his affections. In an attempt to recreate her night with the canon himself, Robinson invited Bonnefoy on a coffee date as well. One can only speculate how their night ended, but the two were spotted leaving the café together, arm in arm and whispering excitedly. Rumors abound that they have already made plans for a second date. We can only hope Bonnefoy isn&#39;t the type to get jealous of himself, because Robinson wasn&#39;t done yet!<br><br>She was later spied talking to Erica Ambrose (ESAS), a relative newcomer to the roster of raunchy agents. While not a Harkness replacement per se, Ambrose is said to be an expy of the Time Agent, and indeed the two look nearly identical, right down to the cleft chin (which, while quite dashing on a man, is much less flattering on her). Not that this seemed to deter Robinson, who indeed <i>initiated</i> the flirting between the pair; a highly suspicious occurrence considering Ambrose&#39;s origins. Ambrose returned the advances eagerly, though, and the two have made plans to meet again. <br><br>Does Bonnefoy know Robinson is going behind his back to sleep with his female counterpart? Does he not care? It would not be out of character for him; as we reported in last month&#39;s issue, he and the changeling Dax (Crossovers) are infamous for hosting their inter-departmental orgies. Perhaps we will shortly be seeing Robinson get together with Bonnefoy and Ambrose at the same time, possibly even with the changeling wearing Harkness&#39; face for good measure. After all, it&#39;s said that their old player created them with none other than Harkness in mind; if Robinson wanted to collect the &#39;full set&#39;, as they say, it&#39;s only a matter of time before she&#39;ll turn up for a visit to Crossovers.</p>

            <p>Taking advantage of the &quot;alternate cast stat&quot; feat that Phobos mentioned and also a ton of Unearthed Arcana stuff, I present to you the Knights of the Twisted Windowpane! Or the Guild of Knights of the Mind, if you prefer Sakura&#39;s ability to name things. The Knights are split between two factions: the Knights of Hope and the Knights of Fear. Here they are:<br><br>Knights of Hope:<br>- Cass - Sorcerer (Wild Magic)/Bard (College to be determined). Cast Stat: Int. Quote: &quot;My quest exists not in any dungeon, but within me.&quot;<br>- Myla - Cleric (Light domain). Cast Stat: Cha. Quote: &quot;As the herald of the Lichtgods, I must spread the gospel of light!&quot;<br>- Sakura - Sorcerer (Stone Sorcery). Cast Stat: Wis. Quote: &quot;The truth must be known, and lies uncovered, at all costs.&quot;<br>- Jacqueline - Fighter (Scout). Style: Two-weapon. Quote: &quot;I will fight alongside you, for honor, for adventure, and most definitely for my friends.&quot;<br>- Elinya - Sorcerer (Divine Soul). Cast Stat: Wis. Quote: &quot;I can do anything with my own special magic!&quot;<br><br>Knights of Fear:<br>- Aldegund - Warlock (Homebrew patron, use your imagination.) Cast stat: Cha. Quote: &quot;It is my fate to reign and carry the torch of my patron.&quot;<br>- Scarlet - Sorcerer (Storm Sorcery). Cast Stat: Cha. Quote: &quot;An apprentice of the storm, in darkness I was forged.&quot;<br>- Teyori - Wizard (Artificer). Cast Stat: Int. Quote: &quot;I&#39;m not evil, I&#39;m just <i>burning</i> with passion! Get it?&quot;<br><br>The chronological order of the Knights&#39; &quot;existence&quot; is as follows: Elinya, Jacqueline, Scarlet, Sakura, Teyori, Aldegund, Myla, and finally Cass, who is me as I am now. However, just for a frame of reference Board-wise, y&#39;all have already experienced Myla and the very tail end of Aldegund (I&#39;m sorry you had to see her).<br><br>Maybe the Kaitlyns could meet the Twisteys? Or meet the good Twisteys and help them defeat the villainous Twisteys? That&#39;d be interesting. Anyway, art coming soon!<br><br>-Twistey</p>

Over all of this is a long black hooded robe worn open and with the hood down, and over that is a brown belt.

            <p>The Eberron Artificer had a certain charm none of the UA versions have, mostly because it meshed well with the setting. I also enjoyed its extreme versatility, and the amazing synergy of the warforged (effectively a playable magic item) and the Artificer (the magic item god). I played a warforged fighter, and I tag-teamed with the Artificer in the party to great effect. I once wrestled a dragon.</p>

            <p>... that wasn&#39;t related to the Artificer, my character was just a complete badass. I started the game with double the hit points of any other party member, and I once bull-rushed a gibbering mouther to the floor, because the rules didn&#39;t say I couldn&#39;t. (A gibbering mouther is a blob of eyes muscle and teeth.)<br><br>Me and the Artificer also represented the moral half of the party, the Changeling psion being abrasive and self-interested, and the Elf ranger having ruined his brain with centuries of drug use and consequently making very bad decisions. (He broke one of the early villains out of jail because he had fallen in love with her.)</p>

            <p>My campaign was the same way for a while: the other Elf wizard and I were the only ones who didn&#39;t help kill the king and his older son. The Aasimar warlock was doing it for his patron, the human rogue was doing it for greed, the Half-Orc paladin was doing it because he and the rogue were BFFs and he would always do what the rogue said, and the Halfling bard had no clue what he was doing wrong. It was great.<br><br>-Twistey</p>

<li>The Artificer is kind of potion-centric. I figured this worked considering that Teyori is me from when I was obsessed with the one Stephen King book I&#39;d read at the time (The Eyes of the Dragon) and its villain, Flagg. I have a tendency to obsess over villains sometimes. (My friend even shipped me with him and then it caught on). I made Teyori the apprentice of a Flagg-equivalent, true to the origin story I came up with of how I met him, and it therefore makes sense because Flagg exhibits little to no magic powers, but instead relies a lot on alchemy to get things done.<br><br>You can find the Unearthed Arcana documents on their page on the D&amp;D 5e Wiki.<br><br>2.

            <p>Here&#39;s a six-stack party, known from the Realms to the Reaches as <s>Wanted: Dead Or Deader</s> <s>Enemies of His Majesty Balazebal the Last, Ever-King and High Lord of Meadowkeep</s> the League of the Weald.<br><br>---<br><br>Sander Truman (Paladin, Oath of Vengeance, Str): Truman came to his devotional orders comparatively late in life, after having been a loyal servant of King Balazebal the Last for several decades and becoming the seneschal of one of the Ever-King&#39;s Outer Orders, the parades of mounted knights that kept the peace of Meadowkeep. He became struck with both religious visions and deep disillusionment with the rule of the Ever-King, and now walks the Grass Sea in a harness of thick platemail, bringing Forgiveness to bear against his newfound foes. Yes, that&#39;s a Discworld reference. However, he does not channel his divine powers through heroic speeches and suchlike, as do so many other paladins; Sander is a man of action, and uses sheer strength of arm to channel the powers of his god into the Material Plane. As might be gathered from this, he&#39;s not the healing kind of paladin. Much more the &quot;smite everything in a wide radius&quot; kind.<br><br>Cassandra Jane (Rogue, Arcane Trickster, Dex): While Sander merely adopted life as an outlaw in the Grass Sea, Cassandra was born in it. Moulded by it. She dashes and dances through the huge plains, her sheer speed and fluid movement hiding the Dancer spells that have kept the Free Peoples safe from the wrath of the Ever-King and his forces. Well, safe-ish. The movements of her long knives through the air form runes of power that cast forth the raw power of magic against her enemies. She is unaware of Sander&#39;s past as a leader of the Outer Orders, and perhaps that is for the best.<br><br>Young Cassie (Cleric, Life Domain, Con): Being any kind of cleric, aside from as part of the Faith of the Ever-King, is a risky business in the lands ruled by Balazebal the Last. The other gods, the old ways, they are a threat to the Ever-King&#39;s power over the Grass Sea, and as such he has declared that those who worship them openly to have forfeited their right to citizenship and clemency. Despite this, and despite having been captured at a very tender age and imprisoned for her crimes in the White Rooms of the Everhold, Young Cassie is secure in her faith. She was kind to the other victims, tending their wounds and easing their pains and passings. After ten years, the maximum sentence under the Ever-King&#39;s inviolable law for one of her age when sentenced (and he&#39;s as draconian with his own forces as he is with his subjects), she was thrown out into the world with a dirty shift and more scars than a regiment of soldiers. She made her living wandering the world, using her divine magic to try and heal the world around her and make it just that bit more bearable for everyone else. She learned to cast her spells through iron-hard patience and resolute resistance to pain; perhaps there are easier ways, but these are the ones she knows, and her flagellant&#39;s knotted lash makes a more than serviceable morning-star as well when she&#39;s forced into a fight.<br><br>Dr. Cassiopeia (Wizard, Lore Master, Int): The caravans of Free Peoples aren&#39;t often home to academics; knowledge, especially of the arcane, is tightly restricted by the Ever-King. The good Doctor, however, is an exception. A willowy woman wearing a scholar&#39;s robes and fussy little spectacles, she&#39;s far more devious than her scatterbrained-professor image suggests. A long-time though subtle dissident, she completed all stages of her thaumaturgical education and proceeded to fake her own death twenty years ago in an unfortunate Fireball accident that demolished her laboratory. She&#39;s been living with the Free Peoples ever since, her eladrin heritage now able to be displayed freely without fear of reprisals from the Ever-King&#39;s various Orders. The Outer Orders might bear sword and lance and burning brands, but the City Orders wield terror and paranoia like a subtle knife.<br><br>The Witch of the Heath (Druid, Circle of Dreams, Wis): The most obviously inhuman of the League&#39;s members - and by definition the one whose appearance must be the most heavily disguised, whether as a human or as a slave - the Witch desires no name beyond her title. She hails from the Realms, on the northern borders of the great Grass Sea, whose great cities and rugged landscape are beyond the reach of the King&#39;s Seal... for now. She embarked early in her life upon a vision quest through the Grass Sea, and moved from hill to hill becoming one with with the world around her. She is a firbolg, and tall for her kind, reaching over eleven feet tall when she stands unbowed. She rarely does, though, preferring to hide under voluminous hard-wearing countrywomen&#39;s clothes. She holds a connection to the Feywild, known to her and her people as the Other Place, and uses it to salve wounds and soothe souls within the battered bands of Free Peoples after skirmishes with Balazebal&#39;s forces. Her staff is bedecked with charms and fetishes that aid her in drawing upon the power of the Other Place. Of particular note in this regard is the enormous flint hagstone lashed to the top; not only is it a direct, if small, gate to the Feywild, it allows her to use that staff as an eminently serviceable warhammer when a suitable occasion arises, such as if a knight of the Outer Orders is charging at her in full platemail with callous disregard for his own safety or the integrity of his spine.<br><br>CJ (Warlock, Great Old One Patron, Pact of the Tome, Cha): The lissom and androgynous CJ likes to think they cut a mysterious figure. Indeed, they like to think it makes them an interesting prospect, as does the tight leggings, corset, and other items of clothing that involve simultaneously too much black leather and a grossly insufficient amount of same. Their face is painted with kohled eyes, their hair spiked into elaborate patterns, their manicured nails alternating between night-black and rich red. It&#39;s a dark appearance, and yet, their aasimar heritage comes from the same life-giving goddess that inspires Young Cassie&#39;s faith. CJ likes to think they&#39;re a master of witty repartee as well, words cutting like the rapier at their hip that hangs from three sword belts at once. The League lets them have their fun, though, because the rest of the League knows what&#39;s under the piratical shirt. Young Cassie and them are more alike than either dares admit to the other. Both bear scars from the Ever-King&#39;s White Rooms, though poor CJ doesn&#39;t sport as many on their flesh. No, their scars are mental, born from bombardment with mind-shattering magics in an attempt to make them into an agent of the Last King. Their wings were torn from their back and the wounds burned with hot irons. As their mind failed, though, some vast and nameless THING reached out through space and time and gently touched their psyche, letting them escape with a morsel of the THING&#39;s power. That was what took them back from the edge of despair at their mutilated body. What took them there was the message burned into skin and soul and brain, each letter screaming loud as a clash of armies in her head: You Volunteered.<br><br>---<br><br>Hope this is interesting. =]</p>

            <p>It really do be like that sometimes, though. =]<br><br>Content Warning: <b>SELF-HARM, BLOOD, TORTURE REFS</b><br><br>---<br><br>Sander Truman: There are those that think that a full plate harness makes the wearer slower than an arthritic snail carrying very heavy shopping. This is not so, and Sander is only too happy to teach them the error of their ways. It&#39;s still very tough, though, which suits him just fine. The armour itself is made in a style recognizable to an observer from our world as Italian white armour, but with some notable differences. His helmet looks more like an English-style three-barred lobster-tail helmet; its open face trades protection for visibility, a far more valuable asset for an unmounted adventurer in the Grass Sea. The gorget of his armour is rather thicker than normal, perhaps to protect against vampires. The pauldrons are unique in that they are asymmetrical: the left pauldron is large and having a raised ridge to aid face protection, while the right is more of a rerebrace, composed as it is of close-fitting separate bands that let the wearer&#39;s right arm be more mobile. The cuirass, or combined breast- and backplate, closes at the side in a modern style rather than at the back, as is more common in cheaper harnesses made for the rank and file of, say, large cavalry organizations. The fauld and tassets hang over a mail skirt, as does the culet or bum-plate. It&#39;s not vital, I just like the term bum-plate. The cuisses and greaves are single pieces of thick steel, with the knees covered by articulated banded poleyns that connect greave to cuisse; a thing of note about the poleyns is that each one&#39;s outermost plate has had something snapped off it and the subsequent mark filed down. Finally, since he is unmounted, he doesn&#39;t wear sabatons, instead opting for thick chocolate-brown leather boots with mail sewn into them that come up to about mid-calf. Oddly for something as obviously expensive as a tailored plate harness, it&#39;s almost entirely free from decoration, with what little there is only visible in the right light due to its having been diligently and painstakingly filed off. Those who know Sander&#39;s history with the Outer Orders know why it was filed off, and what that decoration was in the first place; they&#39;re keeping schtum about it and so should you. In contrast to the burnished but plain steel armour, Forgiveness is a work of art. It&#39;s a two-handed greatsword made of what someone from our world would immediately recognize as Damascus steel, the flowing patterns within the metal obviously not hailing from the armouries of Meadowkeep, even those of master weaponsmiths who would otherwise have outfitted someone of Sander&#39;s rank within the Outer Orders. The most obvious indication of it being foreign to the Grass Sea, however, is its shape: it is a <i><a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1a/Dresden-Zwinger-Armoury-Sword.04.JPG">flammenschwert</a></i>, its blade wavy almost to the point of looking like a giant, straight-bladed breadknife. The crossguard is wide and thick, and the sword features a pronounced ricasso with parrying hooks as seen in the picture linked. Only Sander knows why this beautiful instrument of killing is called Forgiveness, and he&#39;s not telling.<br><br>Faceclaim: David Threlfall in <i>Midwinter of the Spirit</i> (<a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/649287203739299840/uQmZFJZI_400x400.jpg">right</a>)<br><br>Cassandra Jane: Where Sander is decked out in the armour of the Outer Orders and, by extension, of Balazebal the Last, Cassandra Jane wears the traditional garb of the Free Peoples. She wears a flannel short-sleeved tunic, mid-grey in colour and decorated with a pattern similar to our world&#39;s tartan; the pattern is in lighter greys and blacks, and a reasonable reference may be found <a href="https://www.babybedding.com/images/fabric/gray-plaid-fabric_large.jpg">here</a>. It&#39;s pinned at the left breast with an ornate bronze brooch in the shape of a horseshoe, long the unofficial symbol of the Free Peoples. It&#39;s useful for letting the other bands recognise each other in the Grass Sea, otherwise there&#39;d probably be a lot more infighting and accidental skirmishes. Over her tunic, she sports a heavily adapted and decorated buff coat, liberated as a trophy from a cavalry commander of an Outer Order. The once plain tan leather has been dyed pitch-black and decorated with shimmering hagflints - round flints with holes worn in them by the passage of time or some other strange force, each one a little portal to the Feywild - that are sewn into the sleeves and along the front like brass buttons on a Royal Order officer&#39;s smart red coat. She wears it open most of the time. Like so many woman warriors of the Free Peoples, Cassandra favours a baggy trouser; hers are a dark grey, the colour of a storm cloud. Her dark brown leather sword belts are worn at the waist, each featuring just one sword each, which is very unusual. Normally, warriors of the Free Peoples carry a few different daggers as well; a sword won&#39;t do against every opponent, particularly the plate mail of a Knight of the Last King. Her power, though, is not just with swords, but magic as well. Thus she uses twin blades named Oath and Promise that look like our world&#39;s <a href="https://www.coldsteel-uk.com/store/small-sword-88sms-full-1.jpg">smallswords</a>, their dextrous nature and fine points making them ideal for channeling her magic. Her flowing movements and precise carving of runes into the air form spells that burn and blast and shatter, and it is these that have kept her band safe from the predations of the Outer Orders for years. The final part of note is her elaborate facepaint, done on the eve of battle to help her channel her power and her warrior spirit. It&#39;s picked out in an ash grey and is a quite complex design, giving her a hawklike appearance.<br><br>Faceclaim: Lee-Anne Liebenberg in <i>Doomsday</i> (<a href="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/villains/images/a/a4/Viper_%28Doomsday%29.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20120606191048">here</a>)<br><br>Young Cassie: Cassie is a devout priestess and worshipper of Olwyn, the queen of the dawn and enemy of death. While the Ever-King holds all faiths other than the worship of himself to be the utmost heresy, he reserves a special hatred for gods like Olwyn; Balazebal&#39;s power is derived from death, from the Black Veil that cuts this world away from others, and gods of healing from any pantheon are absolute anathema to the Veil. Thus was Young Cassie&#39;s underground sect arrested by the Outer Orders and taken to the White Rooms to be brutalized for a decade. Being in there honed her connection to Olwyn out of desperation, as she healed herself and the only family she&#39;d ever known over and over again. Once out in the world again, the only way she could channel the power of her goddess was through her own suffering, so entangled were the two things in her head. Despite Olwyn herself trying to heal this poor girl, keeping her in the bloom of youth for eighty years now, Young Cassie cannot heal her mind; she merely heals others, and uses her blood and pain to do it. She wears a simple, sleeveless, unembroidered tunic dress that reaches to her knees. It&#39;s a pale grey in colour and seems far too thin and short to properly keep the cold out during the winter months. One peculiar note is that the dress is also backless; she removed the panel because it was just getting in the way of her scourging. Her lash is a homemade thing, a black leather handle attached to a sheaf of long pig-iron chains; it never leaves her hands, even when she&#39;s asleep, and yet still has no name. The heavy chains themselves are bad enough, but some enterprising soul sought to attach heavy iron cubes filled with lead to the ends. It&#39;s these that cause the real damage, and when she works herself into a frenzy of self-mortification, these cause the wounds that take her longest to heal. A day or two at most, despite the flying blood that flecks her gown and leaves the sides speckled with rust-coloured spots. She wears little else than this backless dress; only a baggy burlap hood with crude eye-holes hacked into the fabric. The hood is undyed brown cloth, but still manages to be red at the edges.

As such, she wears the robes of a scholar of magic. These robes are reminiscent of our world&#39;s <i>panling lanshan</i>, the traditional robes of the Chinese imperial scholar-bureaucrat. The good Doctor&#39;s robes are a voluminous affair, with wide, hanging sleeves that trail two feet down. The whole affair gives her the appearance of some kind of sailing ship, especially when she&#39;s in a hurry. The robes themselves are a dark grey, with the collar, cuffs, and edges trimmed in a pale blue to represent her study of higher-order arcana. The robe&#39;s sleeves are delicately embroidered in pale blue with a pattern of elaborate spirals and knots, each one representing a different spell she has mastered. The knotwork reaches up to her shoulders. Her robe is fastened by a wide and very long broadcloth belt knotted about the waist; it&#39;s the same shade of blue as the robe&#39;s trim, and the trailing tails of the belt are pinned in place by a silver horseshoe brooch. Completing the look is her long dark hair pinned back in a fashionable style with small wire-rimmed spectacles on her face. Underneath her robe she wears a long-sleeved shift dress of black velvet; upon her feet she wears black button boots of soft, stitched leather, a far cry from the hobnailed boots of her compatriots among the Free Peoples.

Also bung some pointy ears on.</a>)<br><br>The Witch of the Heath: First things first: the Witch is a firbolg. She&#39;s eleven feet tall. She&#39;s not exactly overburdened with clothing options. Still, she cuts quite a shambolic figure even by those low, low standards. Her pile of thick, curly hair spills down to the hollow of her back and has the same dark green colour as an old oak leaf. Her clothes are patched and mended and smell like dirt and growing things, which is probably to be expected considering her occupation as a druid. She wears an enormous grey cloak, held on with a clasp made not of metal but living wood, complete with leaves and berries sprouting from it. The thing is simple homespun cloth in sufficient quantity to act as a tent for anyone of conventional human size. It also features a hood, though when she wears it she looks like a pile of boulders with a load of vines hanging off them. Underneath, she wears a simple dark brown smock dress that&#39;s absolutely festooned with pockets, patches, and pouches of interesting stuff. It&#39;s worrying just how much <i>stuff</i> she has on her person at any given time, from old bits of string to interesting mushrooms to spell components to waterskins the size of a lamb that smell suspiciously of really, really strong booze. In similar vein, she carries around an enormous backpack full of... well, full of the things that won&#39;t fit in any of her pockets or pouches. On her feet are enormous gumboots that look like they&#39;d be able to survive a direct hit from a ballista, and on her front is a heavy-looking leather apron with several arrows stuck in the front pocket. Finally, there&#39;s her staff Long Walk, which (as covered in the intro post for the party) is a huge slab of bog-oak from the marshy up-country of the Reaches. Fourteen feet long before we even get to the enormous granite hagstone lashed to the top with thick sisal rope, it&#39;s covered in so many charms, fetishes, and totems of magical power that it practically constitutes a flail, or possibly a shop. Given the size of the portal into the Feywild she&#39;s carrying around on the top of her staff, some might consider it overkill to have even more sources of power. Those people have never had to organize a fighting retreat from an entire Outer Order of heavy cavalry intent on butchering everyone in your band. A lot of blood was spilled that day.<br><br>Faceclaim: Jessie Cave in <i>Various Harry Potter Films I&#39;m Not Sure Where This Still&#39;s From Probably Half-Blood Prince</i> (<a href="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/harrypotter/images/8/8e/LavenderBrown_WB_F6_LavenderCrying_Promo_080615_Port.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/333?cb=20180203062638">Except, y&#39;know, a firbolg.</a>)<br><br>CJ: CJ&#39;s outfit was already described in their intro post, with their mix of greys, blacks, and reds. They did name their sword, though. It&#39;s a rapier, a proper cup-hilted design but with the long blade in the style of our world&#39;s <i>espada ropera</i>, the Renaissance progenitor of what we call a rapier. The hilt appears at first glance to be wrapped in red-painted eelskin, but upon closer inspection the wrap doesn&#39;t look like it came from any kind of animal found in the Grass Sea. And there&#39;s some capital-W Weird Stuff in the Grass Sea. Much like Cassandra Jane&#39;s blades, CJ uses it to help cast their spells; unlike Cassandra Jane, however, they aren&#39;t using it to draw signs in the air. Instead, it&#39;s there as part of the presentation, part of the show needed to make the magic happen and channel the madness inside their soul into something tangible, or at the very least productive. A lot of people wonder why the people in the League of the Weald, especially people like Sander who normally suffer fools like CJ about as gladly as they would a dose of galloping syphilis, but those people haven&#39;t seen CJ backed into a corner. Their pact tome appears in the form of a long scroll that seems to go on far longer than the size of the case would imply, it rolls out, and then all bets are off. The many-angled magic of the warlock&#39;s patron is unpredictable, yes, but they&#39;ve managed to rip apart an entire squadron of heavily-armoured knights in one single gibbering moment of squamous horror. Sander knows a thing or two about needing time to come to terms with a new reality, and sees them with compassion as well as exasperation at their cringe-inducing antics outside of battle. This is evidenced by Sander being the only person aside from CJ who knows that their rapier is named Volunteer, and who knows why.<br><br>Faceclaim: Fairuza Balk in <i>The Craft</i>.

I tried to have a themed colour scheme - grey - mixed with an additional colour representing their relationship to my own mental health. Sander, my protective streak, gets white. Cassandra Jane, my love of wordplay, gets silver. Young Cassie, my self-destructive tendencies, gets rust-orange.  Dr. Cassiopeia, my trivia memory, gets blue. The Witch of the Heath, my desire for growth, gets brown. CJ, my dramallama tendencies, gets black.<br><br>I hope these are of interest and use to anyone who reads them.</p>

            <p>There&#39;s the Order of the Butterfly and the Knights of the Twisted Windowpane, who are both fairly light in tone and joke around fighting dragons and climbing (or not climbing) mountains... and then you have the League of the Weald, half a dozen really, <i>really</i> damaged people on the run from an immortal lich-king and his actually competent Legions Of Terror, which is just not sporting on a villain&#39;s part.

Sander, CJ, and Young Cassie in particular would struggle even to be civil with her, while Doc and Cassandra Jane flat-out wouldn&#39;t bother trying.

            <p>I watched this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnoUBfLxZz0">rather interesting YouTube video</a> on how Rwanda&#39;s health care system sends donated blood around by drone, since driving it around doesn&#39;t quite work (because the roads are pretty bad) and they can&#39;t afford the waste that keeping every hospital with an emergency surplus on hand would involve. It&#39;s a pretty neat thing and I thought y&#39;all might think it was cool too.<br><br>(The Wendover Productions channel overall has some pretty interesting videos about logistics and travel and such.)<br><br>- Tomash</p>

            <p>(Alright, we&#39;re going to ignore the recency of my previous new post because nobody did anything with it except my boyfriend. Anyway.)<br><br>Hi. Are there any strategy game buffs around here? Specifically the franchise <i>Axis and Allies</i>, but if not, that&#39;s fine too.<br><br>I&#39;d like y&#39;all&#39;s help. After a fun game of said board game (the version with 2 boards, both of which we had), I&#39;ve had a pretty fun idea to make a couple different PPC versions of it.<br><br>One of them would be about the fictional PPC undertaking a large mission, with the various countries corresponding to different Departments or different Suethors in a friend group of badficcers. The other one, which I admit I&#39;m slightly more power-tripping over, I mean interested in, would be about the real PPC, fighting some kind of huge RP fight in a hypothetical physical manifestation of our various platforms (Board, Discord, etc.) I think this&#39;d be an interesting venture, considering that new PPC-themed games haven&#39;t come out of the community in a while, not even an update to the CAHQ decks if I&#39;ve got this right.<br><br>So now, the main question is, how would the gameplay aspects of this work? I&#39;ve got a few ideas for unit types, but I&#39;m not sure what their stats would be, or how everything would be laid out. Can you guys help?<br><br>Thanks!<br>-Twistey, really afraid that this is going to turn out kind of awkward like her last post.</p>

            <p>Added quite a few things to the main deck (More CAHQ) and the FicPsych deck just yesterday, in fact! And, BTW, if you (or anyone) ever have any suggestions, I&#39;d love to see them. No guarantees that I&#39;ll use them and I reserve the right to edit for good game grammar, but it still really helps.<br><br>&#39;Fraid I&#39;m no use for making a strategy board game, but a Plort setting seems like a good idea.

            <p>I think this would work well with agents as resources. You would recruit agents for your department and send them on missions, securing more influence based on the completion of successful missions, which would in turn allow you to recruit more agents. Does this sound good?</p>

You can do this by making friends with other PPCers - reply to them on-Board, chat with them, exchange emails. You can also do it by sucking up to the Oldbies. ^_^ Dodge the drama - or maybe don&#39;t! Provided you come out looking good, it can really boost your profile.<br><br>Your first pseudo-goal is to work your way up to Permission - so better befriend someone who has the Beta stat! Then you unlock the writing half of the game, which is Agent Manager. You have to create agents, put them together into storylines, and try to write enough, and also <i>uniquely</i> enough, that people pay attention to your missions. (Cowrites are great here.) You might even get people imitating your writing, or even spark a shift in how PPC stories are written... just watch out, because sooner or later some newbie is going to show up and start stealing all that attention out from under you!<br><br>(I literally don&#39;t know whether I&#39;m describing myself or Iximaz here.

            <p>For the sake of equal opportunity for anyone who can&#39;t Give Permission (as I&#39;m assuming that the countries in the Plort game would be the Baronies), instead of taking place in Plort, this third version would take place in a different, less hierarchical representation of the real PPC, and more representative of who actually has influence on the Board, Discord, etc. What I mean by that is, there&#39;s folks like me and all those &quot;scared to try again&quot; folks who don&#39;t have Permission but do a lot for the PPC, and there&#39;s also folks like Kaitlyn, who are Permission Givers but don&#39;t get on here much at all.

            <p>Hi! I&#39;m here to talk to you about dinosaurs. ^_^<br><br>There are, roughly, four eras in the depiction of dinosaurs in the media:<br><br>1. Crystal Palace. The wildly-inaccurate depictions from the <i>very</i> early, mid-19th century days. You know, the ones that are all scaly elephants with Iguanodon nose-horns. (There&#39;s a beautiful recent piece starring one, generally called <a href="https://www.redbubble.com/people/jedtaylor/works/33644952-1854">Jurassic Park 1854</a> by Jed Taylor, which I have on a mug, t-shirt, and tote bag... yeah, the Crystal Palace dinos are making a bit of a reappearance, it&#39;s awesome.)<br><br>2. Great Thunder Lizards. You know, like <i>The Land Before Time</i>. Most stylised depictions still follow this style.<br><br>3. The Dinosaur Renaissance, AKA the time dinosaurs picked up their tails and started running. <i>Jurassic Park</i> dinos.<br><br>4. Finally, and most recently, what&#39;s sometimes called the <i>All Yesterdays</i> movement. This is characterized by the realisation that there&#39;s a lot of stuff - famously feathers, but also other soft tissues, and behaviour - that doesn&#39;t fossilize. The Dinosaur Renaissance got the behaviour of dinos&#39; bones and muscles pretty perfect - the stuff that goes over them is where things are changing now.<br><br>The thing is, most dinosaur media is still either deep in the Renaissance (<i>Jurassic World</i>), or revisiting the Thunder Lizards for cuteness&#39; sake. My question is, what are the best up-to-date, experimenting-with-realistic-appearance-and-behaviour dinosaur <i>things</i> you&#39;ve run into?<br><br>One that I quite like is <a href="https://sauriangame.squarespace.com/">Saurian</a>, a PC game in which you play as (currently) a <i>Dakotaraptor</i>, from a small hatchling following after your parents, to a young animal hunting lizards, to... well, usually to a poisoned/crocodile-eaten corpse, by my record, but theoretically to an adult. (Survival games are not my specialty.)<br><br>They haven&#39;t shied away from feathers - you are very bird-like - or speculative behaviour - at a certain age you can use your wings in &#39;raptor prey restraint&#39;, and you can also climb trees while young. They&#39;ve done their best to be as scientifically accurate as possible - which has included massive redesigns of their <i>T. rex</i>, first to add feathers, then to remove them. The whole thing is set in a similarly-accurate rendition of the Hell Creek area, AKA one of the best known dinosaur formations in the world.<br><br>So that&#39;s <a href="https://sauriangame.squarespace.com/">Saurian</a> (available on Steam now!), but being a dromaeosaur isn&#39;t the only way to enjoy dinosaurs. What else is out there? Enquiring mes want to know!<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I assume documentaries are included, yes? &#39;Cuz I&#39;d like to take this moment for some minor pluggage related to the topic in question, especially since prehistory documentaries have been dear to my heart since childhood - seriously, if you haven&#39;t watched the original <i>Walking With Dinosaurs</i> TV miniseries, please do! All episodes are, as of this writing, available on Dailymotion. Of course, the series is quite dated science-wise, so of course more recent docu-series are trying to go for the All Yesterdays style, with varying degrees of success. In particular, there are three of these I wish to highlight which also deserve mention.<br><br>BBC&#39;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planet_Dinosaur"><i>Planet Dinosaur</i></a>, narrated by John Hurt, takes the more scientific approach to the subject matter, transitioning between CGI renditions of the critters themselves and paleontology findings corresponding to the topic at hand. It should be noted that this series is quite carnivore-centric, and some of the depictions aren&#39;t entirely consistent with what we know of today (long-legged <i>Spinosaurus</i>, <i>Troodon</i> without wing feathers on the arms, that venomous <i>Sinornithosaurus</i> hypothesis that got debunked not long after it was suggested...), but the visuals look wonderful, and even my nitpicky self very much enjoyed the series as a whole, with every single episode having its own appeal. I&#39;m most fond of pterosaurs, sure, but <i>Hatzegopteryx</i> sadly got too little screentime and other pterosaurs ended up being canon fodder. Oh well. The Predator X/<i>Pliosaurus</i> segments were definitely my favorite part, and it&#39;s nice to see a more sensible depiction than that kaiju-sized <i>Liopleurodon</i> from WWD.<br><br>Next on the list is Discovery Channel&#39;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinosaur_Revolution"><i>Dinosaur Revolution</i></a>, which has its own set of issues and could stand to be less sensationalist in particular, but hey, properly feathered dromaeosaurs! In general, this has to be the best set of dinosaur depictions on television, and there was clearly a lot of work put into them with proper feathering and even scale patterns based on whatever skin impressions were available. Plus the animals themselves are colorful, lively, entertaining to watch, and most importantly, as accurate as we can imply from the most current evidence. You may even find yourself rooting for a good number of them as the show progresses. This series opted for separating the segments with the creatures themselves with &quot;talking heads&quot; i.e. paleontologists commenting on the critters featured, which is a bit of hit-or-miss for me since we all know what I care for lol. Still, it&#39;s a visual treat that certainly lived up to its hype, and is leagues ahead of a number of documentaries which either didn&#39;t know better or simply didn&#39;t care. I mean, one of them freaking <i>quote-mined</i> one of the people the makers consulted. Eesh.<br><br>Last on the list is Sir David Attenborough&#39;s <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1777610/"><i>Flying Monsters 3D</i></a>, which I had the pleasure of seeing on the big 3D screen at the local science center at my hometown! Unlike the previous two documentaries, which relegated pterosaurs to bit parts with only one or two segments focusing on them, this one explores them and their evolution in all of this family&#39;s glory. This is another relatively well-researched feature, though it&#39;s one cinematic film rather than a series of episodes, with Attenborough himself leading us through the whole thing and directly interacting with the paleontologists presented, discussing the evidence we have for what pterosaurs were like - and with their proper coating of pycnofibers (hair-like scales akin to birdy down, if you will) and vibrant colors, the animals presented look utterly <i>glorious</i>. As somewhat expected, there are still <a href="http://pterosaur-net.blogspot.com/2011/01/what-despair-pterosaurs-and-david.html">a number of minor and occasionally not-so-minor boo-boos</a> that can be spotted by a sharp-eyed viewer. (Of particular note is a segment with <i>Tupandactylus</i> courting, but both males and females have the same tall crest that only the males have in reality. Think about what that means for a second...) For what it&#39;s worth, though, the film has impressive visuals, and when it does get something right, it demonstrates it beautifully. As someone who insists on more accurate pterosaurs in media (to the point where I disguised my PPC persona as a terrestrial ground-stalking <i>Quetzalcoatlus</i> on two separate missions), this film is a guilty pleasure for me and my inner paleo-nerd, and while best taken with an amount of salt that can vary between a grain and a whole darn shaker, it&#39;s an impressive piece of work nonetheless.<br><br>And there you have it, three of my favorite pieces of modern dinosaur media. If anyone has any works they&#39;d like to recommend themselves, feel free to let us know and discuss them as well!</p>

            <p>I have it on DVD, it was amazing, even if as you say the science is a bit old now. (Also, the <i>Walking With Monsters</i> prequel has given me a lifelong vendetta against arthropods, so there&#39;s that. ^_^)<br><br>I&#39;ve not seen any of the three you list, though I do remember a few rants about <i>Dinosaur Revolution</i>. Interesting that all three were done about the same time! I suspect a lot of the work they put into their models fed into the live <a href="https://dinosaursinthewild.com/">Dinosaurs in the Wild</a> experience, which was AMAZING and hits the same modern-dino notes. (I vividly remember a field full of <i>Dakotaraptor</i> threat-displaying their tails and wings against an oblivious <i>Alamosaurus</i>.) Sadly, DitW has shut down now, but if it ever tours near to you, I heartily recommend it.<br><br>As the person with an actual terrestrial-stalking <i>Quetzalcoatlus</i> agent, I think I&#39;m most intrigued by <i>Flying Monsters</i>; I might see if I can figure out a way to watch it in 3D...<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>&quot;Are dinosaurs real?&quot;<br><br>Kaitlyn swatted away the hand that had lifted her headphone away and span her chair to face the intruder. &quot;I don&#39;t think you understand how this works,&quot; she said over the cheery chords of the Shire theme. &quot;When <i>I</i> sneak up on <i>you</i> and ask bizarre questions, it&#39;s funny. When <i>you</i> do it to <i>me</i>, it&#39;s the worst thing ever.&quot;<br><br>Agent Huinesoron looked briefly mortified, but then he seemed to take in the smile on her face and relaxed. He said something that Kaitlyn couldn&#39;t hear over the music, then looked immediately guilty.<br><br>Kaitlyn tugged off the headphones and dropped them onto her console. &quot;I&#39;m going to assume that was a grovelling apology,&quot; she said, then regretted it immediately as the elf&#39;s obvious guilt deepened. &quot;Sorry, that was meant to be a joke,&quot; she assured him. &quot;I didn&#39;t mean to upset you.&quot;<br><br>&quot;It&#39;s... it&#39;s fine.&quot; The elf shook his head in bewilderment. &quot;I&#39;m sorry, too.&quot;<br><br>&quot;No need.&quot; Kaitlyn pursed her lips in thought. &quot;Unless you broke the lock to get in here,&quot; she corrected herself. &quot;Selene gets <i>kinda</i> antsy about her privacy.&quot;<br><br>&quot;No, she let me in,&quot; Huinesoron said hastily. &quot;I know her from back in DOGA, remember.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Ohhhh, that makes <i>sense</i>.&quot; Kaitlyn beamed, then reached down and fiddled with the controls on the side of her chair. With a hiss, the seat rose up, adding about a foot to her height, bringing her that much closer to eye level. &quot;Well, it&#39;s good to see you! What brings you here?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Er.&quot; Huinesoron coughed. &quot;Dinosaurs?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yes! Right.&quot; Kaitlyn tugged at her waistcoat, straightening it. &quot;In what canon? Because I&#39;m sure you know as well as I do that there&#39;s a <i>Triceratops</i> in Mary Sues and a <i>T. rex</i> in Internal Affairs. I&#39;m told there&#39;s a <i>Velociraptor</i> or something here in Floaters, too, though I&#39;ve never met him.&quot;<br><br>&quot;We&#39;ve got a <i>Quetzalcoatlus</i> in Analytical Science,&quot; Huinesoron supplied. &quot;But I meant your world.&quot; He frowned. &quot;Or mine? Because Middle-earth is the history of World One, correct?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I mean... maybe?&quot; Kaitlyn wobbled her hand in what she intended to be an illustrative gesture. &quot;I think World One is the future of Middle-earth, without the reverse necessarily being true.&quot; She frowned. &quot;Something about chiral history, I think? You&#39;d have to ask one of your DAS lot.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I asked Norlossë from Multiversal Physics,&quot; Huinesoron said, his lip twitching in an involuntary smile. &quot;Her answer was about as coherent-or-otherwise as yours.&quot;<br><br>&quot;That actually makes me feel pretty good,&quot; Kaitlyn mused. &quot;If <i>no-one</i> understands this stuff... anyway, sorry! You were saying?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Dinosaurs,&quot; Huinesoron reminded her. &quot;Are they real?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Why do you want to know?&quot; Kaitlyn leant back, her office chair issuing a deep rumbling sound as it tilted. &quot;Is this for a mission, or just a new hobby?&quot;<br><br>&quot;An old one,&quot; the elf said. &quot;You know I&#39;m in the geology division at DAS? Well, I found some rocks in the White Mountains during a recent survey that <i>could</i> be dinosaur fossils - except I&#39;m not even sure that&#39;s possible.&quot; He frowned slightly, head tilting to one side. &quot;So I suppose it was a mission, too, in a way.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Not just &#39;a way&#39;,&quot; Kaitlyn corrected. &quot;Infrastructure - or whatever Analytical Science counts as - missions are still just as mission-y as Action missions! Don&#39;t put yourself down.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I&#39;ll remember that,&quot; Huinesoron murmured. &quot;So... dinosaurs?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I know, I know, I&#39;m getting to it.&quot; Kaitlyn drummed her fingers on the arm of her chair and sat up straight. &quot;Previous caveats about chiral history aside, there are two schools of thought on the matter,&quot; she explained. &quot;The first is that yes, dinosaurs totally existed.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Okay...&quot; Huinesoron eyed her warily. &quot;And the second?&quot;<br><br>&quot;The same,&quot; Kaitlyn said, grinning widely, &quot;but with a big argument about feathers. Does that answer your question?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I think it does.&quot; Huinesoron returned her smile, pairing it with a nod of thanks. &quot;You&#39;ve been,&quot; he considered for a moment, &quot;very helpful.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Nah; but I&#39;ll accept the &#39;helpful&#39; part.&quot; Tugging at the console, Kaitlyn swung herself back round and picked up her headphones. &quot;After all,&quot; she said, slipping them on and letting the music wash over her again, &quot;that&#39;s what friends are for.&quot;<br><br><hr>
<br><br>There&#39;s kind of far more prehistoric animals in the PPC than I realised; it&#39;s fun!<br><br>As for why hS didn&#39;t just ask the archaeologists at DAS-AWAY: Durand has trouble separating the concepts of &#39;dinosaur&#39; and &#39;dragon&#39;, and Joan doesn&#39;t like to deal with anything pre-industrial if she can help it.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>It&#39;s been over a year in the doing, but I guess it&#39;s time to bite the bullet and just announce it... Huinesoron&#39;s Webplex has officially moved over to Neocities, and can now be found here:<br><br><a href="https://huinesoron.neocities.org/">Huinesoron&#39;s Webplex</a><br><br>The move - the first time I&#39;ve left [Free]Webs since the launch of Bonsaimallorn back in &#39;03 - comes because Webs have been getting slower and slower, and I wanted something that I could actually update without a struggle. There&#39;s a lot of out-of-date backlinks which I&#39;ll need to sort out, but everything should now be linked from the new site.<br><br>There&#39;s even a few new things scattered throughout there, though not as many as my original idealistic plans. One that might interest a fair number of you, though, is the official hub for <a href="https://huinesoron.neocities.org/PPC/inLifesName.html">In Life&#39;s Name</a>, the PPC/Young Wizards stories some of us wrote a while back. Included in there is something I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve shared before: a short piece by Kaitlyn entitled <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vSICaj9e6ydtoFzbadOsSR0tnbaDfE-YctpVDPScmKxdmzvAUvlAzPzWsiHA1ocgSLMGGrXoBpiL0JJ/pub">Mars</a>.<br><br>So there it is! If you find a dead link or any images that don&#39;t work, I&#39;d appreciate a heads-up; there&#39;s a lot of stuff on there, and I&#39;m positive I&#39;ve missed at least a few things.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Though given how many times links to my stuff have changed, I&#39;m sure half of them are wrong anyway. ^_~<br><br>Neocities is actually really comfortable to use! The dashboard is set up pretty much like a Windows folder, and you can either edit files in there (their editor has a green-on-black mode, which feels very 80s-movie-hacker), or upload them from your computer. Uploads will automatically overwrite previous versions, and it all happens <i>fast</i>. Webs was taking most of a minute to move to a sub-folder; Neocities is just as fast as the computer.<br><br>Bottom line: I&#39;ve finally started testing changes on an offline version, because it&#39;s now really easy to put them onto the live site afterwards.<br><br>The green... I know, I know. :-/ But. It&#39;s currently Huinesoron Green, aka &lt;font color=&quot;Huinesoron&quot;&gt;, and that amuses me too much to change just yet.<br><br>I probably will at some point, though, &#39;cause it is pretty bright.

            <p>Though I&#39;m not sure how useful it&#39;d be in this particular case - I restructured the site while I moved it, so you&#39;d need to know exactly where everything came from and went to.<br><br>Heh, my offline editing is all done through plain old Notepad, which makes Javascript a bit of a nightmare.

            <p>For those technically savvy enough, I actually potentially endorse GitHub Pages for hosting. At the very least, GitHub is good place to keep your website sources if you wanna back them up. But even just putting your stuff on the hard drive is a good option.<br><br>For the archivists in the audience, &quot;wget -mk &quot; is a command line command that will grab an entire website and convert all the links automatically for you so that it no longer points to where you grabbed it from. This command is included in Mac computers (just launch &quot;Terminal&quot; and type it in), but not on Windows.<br><br>For tech heads, Neocities actually runs an IPFS node. This means that you can run a node that will act as a fallback for accessing your site using IPFS should Neocities ever fail. I mean... nobody actually <i>uses</i> IPFS yet. But maybe one day.<br><br>I would heavily endorse not using Notepad. For one thing, Notepad only barely supports that Unix line endings that almost every other application in the world expects for text files. For another, ++ and other editors have support for all kinds of fun stuff that makes the editing experience much better.</p>

            <p>... I <i>have</i> a backup.

            <p>This is a copy-paste of a message I sent to Nesh that should be useful for anyone trying to take copies of websites:<br><br>The magic incantation for archiving stuff<br><br>wget -x -p -m -np -k -E <a href="http://example.com/optional-subdirectory/"><a href="http://example.com/optional-subdirectory/">http://example.com/optional-subdirectory/</a></a><br><br>To use this:<br><br>1) Download the latest wget.exe from <a href="https://eternallybored.org/misc/wget/"><a href="https://eternallybored.org/misc/wget/">https://eternallybored.org/misc/wget/</a></a> put it in a new folder where you&#39;ll want to keep your stuff<br>2) Then, Shift+right click on the folder you put wget.exe into and select &quot;Open Command Prompt here&quot;<br>3) Type in the magic incantation, hit Enter. The bits with dashes can go in any order, so long as the URL is last and the word &quot;wget&quot; is first.<br>4) There&#39;ll be a folder named example.com or what have you in the same place as wget.exe, and all the files there will have been rewritten to not have absolute references to other parts of your site (if you don&#39;t want that behavior, remove the -k , if you also want the originals, add -K)<br><br>(For a short explanation:<br>- wget is a program that&#39;s designed to download things<br>- Most of this is various options to control how wget will download things<br>  + -x says to always create a directory for the thing you downloaded<br>  + -p means to also download all the CSS, images, and so on that a<br>downloaded page needs<br>  + -m is shorthand for all the thing you need to ask for to get mirroring<br>  + -np prevents the download from following links that don&#39;t point into the site being downloaded (well, above the directory the thing you started from lives in, but that&#39;s minor)<br>  + -k enables the &quot;make this download self-sufficient&quot; rewrites mentioned above)<br>  + -E adds a .html to web pages that were missing one)<br><br>- Tomash</p>

            <p>But not that much. Since the individual missions and whatnot are mostly on Gdocs, and those haven&#39;t changed (or have they?), I&#39;d be dealing mainly with &quot;home&quot; pages in batches anyway.<br><br>Now, when I do <a href="https://plotprotectors.neocities.org/">the Lost Tales</a>, I did keep the file structure the same, so I&#39;ll be able to do that all in one solid go. ^_^<br><br>Oh, yeah, that happened. Really, really surprisingly quickly. Tomash&#39;s wizardry is invaluable.<br><br>As for Neocities eventually failing... well, all my stuff is backed up on my laptop and Archive.today (or whatever it is now), I think. Also, I think I might become a subscriber? At five bucks a month, it seems reasonable, and if enough people respect the Internet way of electing to throw money at things we value, hopefully it&#39;ll work.<br><br>I suppose I could maintain things on both Neocities and Tripod indefinitely, but... eh. {= /<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>The new website looks nice, but the layout seems to be broken on mobile devices. Additionally, the only way to access the In Life&#39;s Name stories is through an imagemap, which I *strongly* advice you to reconsider. I know it looks pretty, but there are a lot of accessibility issues with doing it that way.</p>

            <p>I actually always intended to have a table of contents; I just... didn&#39;t get round to it. I&#39;ve fixed it now, and added the all-important last page (or at least, last that non-wizards can see...).<br><br>As for the layout - broken how? It&#39;s deliberately designed to pare itself down to a single column, which works perfectly on my phone. The top and bottom bars get slightly messed up, but the main body works pretty much as intended.<br><br>hS</p>
