            <p>And to answer your first question, I&#39;ve gotten back into Kamen Rider (A Japanese tokusatsu show), but have yet to actually watch anything since getting back into it. Coincidentally, as I was typing this, my torrent of Kamen Rider Build finished, so I&#39;ll pick up where I left off there. I&#39;ve picked up The Flash on Netflix and gotten Pokémon Sapphire on an emulator, I&#39;ve read a bunch of good UNDERTALE webcomics, and... I think that&#39;s it.</p>

            <p>I quite liked this!  It&#39;s a good, simple mission to start out your spin-off with.  I liked Edward and Kat as supportive, non-bickering siblings who use good teamwork.  I also liked the symmetry of them coming from an orphanage (I think?  I haven&#39;t read <i>Miss Peregrine</i> yet) and being faced with a Sue who put herself into an orphanage as part of a tragic backstory for sympathy points.  You also made good use of a lot of visual puns and other jokes based on the typos this fic had.<br><br>One little detail that struck me as unique and creative is Edward being too slow a writer to keep the charge list updated with the fic.  I think we tend to take it for granted, being word-oriented people, that the word-recording aspect of an agent&#39;s job is a simple task for everyone.  I liked seeing representation of someone who has a more difficult time writing quickly.<br><br>I found a few formatting mistakes and a typo.  First, the typo:<br><br>&quot;She avoided Slytherin in exactly the same <b>was</b> as Harry had canonically done, and was inevitably Sorted into Gryffindor.&quot;<br><br>A couple of lines have the bolding from the fanfiction quotes bleeding into your narration:<br><br><b>Then the whole hall erupted into applause. Unfortunately, this broad description also affected the agents. “Stupid Words…” Kat muttered, gritting her teeth and clapping in a strangely forced way.<br><br>Kat gulped in air, looking like a goldfish. “She can’t become the fifth Marauder. She can’t.” Kat’s voice was carefully kept level and calm, but the bitterness behind it was undisguisable. “Please. Make this stop.” She shuddered and grabbed a whole six-pack of Bleeprin.</b><br><br>And finally, a missing space between sentences:<br><br>&quot;The Sue’s body soon returned to the original yellow <b>cube.Kat</b> had to stay where she was, because Edward had the RA.&quot;<br><br>I&#39;m looking forward to reading more from you.  Happy writing!<br><br>—Thanks to the Sue&#39;s first name, doctorlit has had &quot;Uma Thurman&quot; by Fall Out Boy stuck in his head for most of this reading.  So that&#39;s one good thing the badfic has done!</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve been writing and reading a lot of poems lately, and I thought we could share some of our favorites (or our favorite poets) with each other. I&#39;ll go first.<br>I wish I could show you some Hungarian poetry because a lot of contemporary Hungarian stuff is so raw and gripping, but it doesn&#39;t really get translated... but I will say that one of my fave Hungarian poets is a good acquaintance of mine (and sort of my literary mentor), and I&#39;m planning to ask him to autograph his newest poetry book for me.<br>And here are some English-language poems that I really love:<br><a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/browse?contentId=35583"><a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/browse?contentId=35583">https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/browse?contentId=35583</a></a> (This one is easily one of the most beautiful things I&#39;ve ever read. &quot;Ache of unbeing.&quot; It&#39;s amazing.)<br><a href="http://www.rjgeib.com/thoughts/marble/adele.html"><a href="http://www.rjgeib.com/thoughts/marble/adele.html">http://www.rjgeib.com/thoughts/marble/adele.html</a></a><br><a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/56715/warming-her-pearls"><a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/56715/warming-her-pearls">https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/56715/warming-her-pearls</a></a><br><a href="http://otherpens.tumblr.com/post/183660035491/awed-frog-this-is-both-amazing-and-profoundly"><a href="http://otherpens.tumblr.com/post/183660035491/awed-frog-this-is-both-amazing-and-profoundly">http://otherpens.tumblr.com/post/183660035491/awed-frog-this-is-both-amazing-and-profoundly</a></a><br>Also, I love Margaret Atwood&#39;s poems, but they&#39;re usually pretty heavy stuff.<br><br>So, what are your favorite poems?

            <p>The longest running mistake I&#39;ve ever had in my life so far has been not keeping up with poems since highschool or so. <br><br>Easily my favourite poem of all time, something that&#39;s been a big influence on my own writing and so on would be <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/43997/the-rime-of-the-ancient-mariner-text-of-1834">The Rime of the Ancient Mariner</a>. Bloody classic! Coleridge is a good fella and this is of course probably his most famous poem. <br><br>I&#39;m also a fan of his <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/43991/kubla-khan">Kubla Khan</a>. Also the poem the game Sunless Sea took its name from, thus robbing <i>me</i> of a great name and cute literary reference to use, in the process. <br>I&#39;m very fond of the Romantics in general, really. Ought to read more of them. <br><br><a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44214/preludes-56d22338dc954">Preludes</a>, by T.S. Eliot, is another one I&#39;m fond of. On a purely descriptive level, alone, the imagery is incredibly vivid. You get a real sense of place. <br><br>Not the deepest, hardest pulls for poetry, I&#39;ll admit. But they&#39;re good fun anyhow. </p>

            <p>I mean, it&#39;s kind of poetry. It&#39;s also a shameless self-plug.<br><br>This is what I did this year for my birthday, and also the 25th of March: A solo acapella arrangement of a couple of JRR Tolkien&#39;s poems from <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>.<br><br><a href="https://soundcloud.com/user-540910811/all-that-is-gold-seek-for-the-sword"><a href="https://soundcloud.com/user-540910811/all-that-is-gold-seek-for-the-sword">https://soundcloud.com/user-540910811/all-that-is-gold-seek-for-the-sword</a></a><br><br>It&#39;s far from perfect, but, being as it is the first acapella thing I&#39;ve ever done solo and also my first recording of an original composition, I&#39;m pretty pleased with how it came out.<br><br>JRR Tolkien is definitely my favorite poet. I got into an epic grudge match with a college professor about it too, once. (She took offense to the idea of rhyming poetry, claiming it needlessly limited creative potential.) That being said, I can&#39;t honestly say my own original poetry emulates his very much. Here&#39;s a sonnet I wrote for a school project last year:<br><br>An age I’ve stood upon this shaking shore<br>And waited for the woman of my dreams<br>As absent as that told-of fair Lenore<br>But not in absence absent, no, agleam<br>And glowing on a ship across the flat<br>Expanse of water glowing at my feet,<br>Her presence will be, has been, but not that<br>Which is is her, nor presence does she greet.<br>For when she is then I am not and when<br>I am she’s not. Our love is ever doomed<br>Except for moments stolen before “then”,<br>When “earlier” is “now” and now’s presumed.<br><br>These moments will be, have been, but are not<br>For I sacrifice myself for what she’s wrought.<br><br>As far as other poetry, I recently picked up David Elliot&#39;s <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40796139-voices"><i>Voices</i></a>, which is about Joan of Arc. I haven&#39;t finished it yet, but I&#39;m enjoying it so far! I&#39;d highly recommend it.</p>

            <p>I actually have a poem to share, but it&#39;s part of a larger plug that I hope to have out later this week, so it&#39;ll have to wait. {= )<br><br>In the meantime, I heard about the &quot;Celebrating Bach&quot; Google Doodle today, and since I had a snippet of melody in my head, I decided to see what the AI would make of it.

            <p>So, here are my ideas for agents so far.<br><br>Agent Quantum is a vampire from the diary of a neurotic zombie continuum (where vampire abilities are limited to immortality, flight and super strength and though they crave blood they can go without it. They also burn easily in the sun but this can be dealt with using SPF 150 suncream.). They were an unmentioned character who fell through a plot hole and landed in hq. They have short messy dark brown hair and silvery blue eyes. Her preferred outfit is an xkcd &#39;stand back I&#39;m going to try science&#39; t-shirt, a fleece of some sort, black or navy tracksuit bottoms and some loose trainers. She loves growing plants and collects cuttings of native plants from continuums she visits, meaning that the RC she works in is lined with many plant pots. She also likes chemistry, and by chemistry I mean mixing stuff together with her chemistry set and seeing if it explodes or not. She is currently trying to make something that is like sugar but with an even greater effect. Quantum is often very ditzy, unfocused and excitable, but is dangerously competent when made angry enough. However, that threshold is rather high.<br><br>Agent Kit is a half human half yo-kai from the yo-kai watch continuum. She was taken via embryo extraction kit from <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12049138/1/Half-n-Half">this fic</a> and grew up in the nursery, just recently becoming an agent. She looks mostly human, apart from fox ears, clawed fingers and nine brown tails. Her brown hair is usually tied up in a neat ponytail. She did inherit some power from her father, but that mostly equates to small, slightly-bigger-than-a-candle-size fireballs. She just moved into a response centre with Quantum and is less than amused with her behaviour. Like her father, she is quite obsessed with looking good and spends most of her free time brushing herself, or trying to make her disguise as beautiful as possible. Before joining, she read through a large portion of the PPC handbook at least twice. She is highly protective of her canon relatives, but despises fics that ship her parents, or one of her parents and someone who they&#39;re not canonically related to, especially if they end up with kids.<br><br>...So, yeah. These are my agents so far.</p>

            <p>We don&#39;t have any villains and one of the two agents I have in mind is based on me (therefore, it would be too difficult for me to capture his personality in the confines of a bio), and I really want to do this. Don&#39;t worry, this will not turn into an Emergency except in his daydreams and fanfics.<br><br>(Warning: Some canon knowledge of Kamen Rider Zi-O may be required, or this bio will be hard to follow. You can read up on the Kamen Rider wiki. I strongly recommend the pages on things like the Ziku Driver, the Ridewatches, the Anotherwatches and Another Riders, and maybe the Time Jackers.)<br>NAME: Fanon a.k.a. Kamen Rider Fanon<br>AGE: Adult<br>HOME CONTINUUM: Unknown<br>APPEARANCE: Japanese, thin, short white (but surprisingly tame) anime hair, brown eyes, wears something new every time he’s encountered. He has brown eyes.<br>AFFILIATION: Himself, Another Characters, one of the Mary Sue Factories<br>HEIGHT and WEIGHT: I don’t give specifics to make my writing more flexible.<br>BACKSTORY: He’s definitely had some affiliation with the Mary Sue Factories and tried to unite them, but “[they’re] too busy fighting amongst themselves and wasting their time on trying to breach HQ’s defneses to lend [him] an ear.” He resides in a secret lair that exists between the continua and has protections from being located by the PPC. Sometime before his first appearance, he character replaced Shrek using the methods detailed below and acquired the Shrek Ridewatch (details below).<br>PERSONALITY: Typical polite Kamen Rider villain applied to the PPC. Very polite and places an emphasis on the “rules of Tokusatsu” such as “no interrupting the transformation sequence”, “no interrupting the evil monologue in which I explain in detail exactly what you’re facing in terms of evil plans and just exposit wantonly”… when they’re in his favor. He has aspirations to create an army of character replacements and Suvians that he can control to become king of the multiverse. He has a tendency to ham things up in a similar manner to Kuroto Dan (before he went completely off the rails) and Woz, giving expository, scene-chewing, and mustache-twirling monologues. He really enjoys the sound of his own voice, and has a habit of telling PPC agents all about about his plans and powers, which tends to blow up in his face when that includes how to counter them. He thinks that there is nothing wrong with screwing up canon and will aid and abett Mary Sues whenever possible by interfering with missions. Direct combat is his forte, and he likes to drag Mary Sues on his side to make it nigh-impossible for agents to continue their mission.<br>ABILITIES AND ARSENAL: <br>• Suefluence - Has some level of Suefluence, as by making eye contact with canon characters, he can throw them OOC, implant non-canon memories of him being their best friend, or generally do just enough to their minds that they are ready to accept and use his Anotherwatch.<br>• Hacked Ziku Driver - A modified version of the Ziku Driver from Kamen Rider Zi-O that is painted with some red accents and compatible with his special Ridewatches.<br>Fanon Ridewatch - His personal Ridewatch. When it is placed in the left slot (his right) of the Hacked Ziku Driver and the Driver is spun 360º, it transforms him into Kamen Rider Fanon and accesses his main form.<br>Raku-Raku Ridewatch Creator - An orange-and-silver Kamen Rider-style dagger with two slots, one on each side of the hilt, for Ridewatches and Anotherwatches. It has three modes: Blade Mode enlarges the blade to be used for combat, Gun Mode allows him to shoot energy projectiles from the blade (classic Kamen Rider logic), and Watchmaker Mode allows him to create new Ridewatches and Anotherwatches in pairs. (See Ridewatch/Anotherwatch Creation below.) By plugging in one of his Ridewatches, he can execute its Slash Bash (Blade Mode) or SPaG Destruction (Gun Mode).<br>Ridewatch/Anotherwatch Creation - This is what allows him to interfere with canon. When he stabs or slashes a canon character with the Raku-Raku Ridewatch Creator in Watchmaker Mode, one of two things will happen:<br>  • If the canon has enough commonly-used fanon surrounding them that directly contradicts their canon character (if a distinct, consistent “fanon self” can be identified separate from the “canon self”), the that canon will vanish into a plothole, and an Anotherwatch and Ridewatch based on that character will appear in the Ridewatch Creator’s slots. An Anotherwatch encapsulates its character’s fanon self, and when a compatible character from the same continuum uses that Anotherwatch, they will be transformed into the fanon version of that Anotherwatch’s character. Therefore, an Anotherwatch serves two purposes: Replacing a canon character with their fanon self, and eliminating another canon character from the equation entirely. The Ridewatch can be used by Fanon in the right (his left) slot of the Hacked Ziku Driver to access a Character Armor based on that character. Doing so augments his base Rider form with some of that character’s powers. (e.g. Sans gets stabbed by the Ridewatch Creator and disappears into a plothole. Fanon then gives Papyrus the Sans Anotherwatch and uses some Suefluence to convince Papyrus to use it. When he uses the Anotherwatch, Papyrus becomes the fanon version of Sans; wangsting all the time about how he couldn’t save his brother, always ready to take on the human with GASTER BLASTERS OF DOOM, super determined and still not a puddle despite what canon says should happen to him, can remember resets, and sexually attracted to fangirls. As for Papyrus, his original personality still exists, but lies dormant, and Papyrus has no idea what transpires while he is fanon Sans. Meanwhile, Fanon gains the Sans Ridewatch, which can be used to access Kamen Rider Fanon SansArmor, giving him Gaster Blasters, the ability to summon bone projectiles, and very low defense.)<br>  • The canon will be surprised that that did nothing to them. Don’t question Tokusatsu logic, where getting slashed by a sword doesn’t mean being cut in half and finishing moves can go through the enemy without the damage that would logically cause.<br>• Adding on to the above: The main purpose of this ability is to generate character replacements without needing to wait for a fangirl to write them. An added bonus is that Fanon gets a new Character Armor to play with in his Suvian outings. The character replacement resulting from Anotherwatch use is called an Another Character, and a C-CAD will register both the character tricked into using the Anotherwatch and the Another Character they became. (Using the above example, a C-CAD pointed at Another Sans would register Papyrus, but would not be able to get a lock on his OOC level because he is dormant and hidden away. It would then register Another Sans as a character replacement.) Another Characters can be defeated in direct combat using a power from their home continuum (so the UNDERTALE player character’s determination would be able to defeat Another Sans), but can also be executed through normal means. When they die, they (or their remains) will crackle with electricity and then explode Kamen Rider-style, dropping the character transformed into them and the Anotherwatch used. The latter will also crackle with electricity and explode due to the damage sustained. For this reason, throwing Another Characters into lava is not advised as you will kill the canon who drops from them as well, but stabbing them through the chest or throwing them off a cliff is fine as the canon is dormant and will not be harmed. As mentioned before, however, Fanon really enjoys pitting agents against Mary Sues in combat, and since Another Characters are basically character replacements, it’s best to bring a counter to their power in case - no, for the inevitable moment that things go south.<br>• Takes One to Kill One: Defeating him permanently will require the assistance of a Kamen Rider agent.<br>• The Rules of Tokusatsu: Powers based on common Tokusatsu tropes, including:<br>  • A force field that prevents anyone from interrupting his monologue or transformation sequence.<br>  • Stealth Hi/Bye: The ability to teleport by hiding himself from the screen, or whatever counts as that in textual media. For example, he can run behind some trees or hide himself in an explosion and turn up in his secret lair.<br>  • Plot Armor: He’ll always have his transformation trinkets. If someone throws his Ridewatches or Hacked Ziku Driver into, say, a plothole to a random location, he’ll eventually track them down, and he can rest easy that, by some contrived coincidence, they’ll avoid destruction.<br>Plothole Manipulation: Can open plotholes between anywhere and his secret lair.<br>• Common OC Creation: He can use the above method for replacing characters with their fanon selves to replace characters with original character concepts that are common within the fandom like Coldsteel and Herobrine, and he can acquire a Ridewatch from it. He still needs two compatible canon characters: One to be stabbed to get the Ridewatch and Anotherwatch and the other to serve as the host for the Another Character. As an example, he could make Steve disappear to get the Herobrine Ridewatch/Anotherwatch and use Notch or Alex as the host to become Another Herobrine.<br><br>For those who, as expected, don’t understand any of this: He’s a guy who uses the power of Kamen Rider Zi-O’s villains and heroes to replace characters with their fanon selves or character concepts used commonly within the fandom, provided the fanon for either is in some way consistent, and demands another canon character to serve as the host for the replacement. He also likes tormenting agents by forcing them to either face a Mary Sue in direct combat or abort the mission and face the Flowers’ wraths.</p>

            <p>And more generally, all badfic? True, it&#39;s more PvE than PvP, but it counts.<br><br>This wouldn&#39;t be the first time someone attempted to introduce a Big Bad to the universe, but IMO, it doesn&#39;t work very well. If it&#39;s not an Emergency that drags in half of HQ whether we like it or not, it&#39;s aggrandizement for the few agents whom the villain sets up to be the Big Heroes, and that can be more irritating than entertaining without just the right balance of gravitas and humor. What makes your agents so special that the villain is picking on them, you know? Where are the DES and DIA, who ought to be dealing with this sort of thing?<br><br>I think Artemis and friends almost pulled it off with the Red Sue, way way back in the day. Some of the agents involved were DIA, which helped. But IIRC, the arc was never finished, which is always a potential pitfall.<br><br>I&#39;ll admit that a card-carrying, monologuing, mustache-twirling sort of villain sounds like it could be fun, though, if other people wanted to play on an opt-in basis and it didn&#39;t end up being a power trip for a couple agents singled out to be Big Heroes. There are questions that would need answers, too, about how he knows about the PPC, how did he ever become an agent and/or go rogue without being found out and stopped if he&#39;s prone to expositing his evil plans, how does he keep getting away from the agents to strike again, etc. The short answer to all of those might be &quot;comedic hijinks,&quot; but a long answer would be required at some point. {= )<br><br>As always, I advise newcomers to start small, with a regular pair of agents doing regular sorts of missions, to establish your characters and also yourself, as a writer and a community member. It really helps to build a solid foundation first if you want to go on to do bigger things later. {= )<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Quincy was kind enough to check over my agents a while ago, but I&#39;ve been meaning to get critique on my changes since then.<br><br><br>Agent The First:<br><br>Chenille is a male rabbit-wearer taguel from <i>Fire Emblem: Awakening</i>; a former bit character tailored to be a canonical taguel&#39;s love interest that was recruited due to circumstance. Taguel as a species are shape-shifters that use special items known as Beaststones to transform. He suffers from night terrors of an event in his backstory. He speaks only when he deems it necessary but when he does he&#39;s blunt and abrupt, though not out of purposefully trying to be rude. Due to a lack of socialization, he&#39;s rather bad at &quot;reading the room&quot;. He has trust issues that, in part, cause his to be distant when interacting with others. But for those he trusts -- as well as children -- he&#39;s fiercely protective of.<br><br>Agent The Second:<br><br>Merula Velveteen is a human woman (mostly), also originating from <i>Fire Emblem: Awakening</i>. She was a former Replacement for The Avatar -- a character most commonly known as Robin -- and was recruited by Chenille due to circumstance. Merula mainly uses Wind magic and a rapier from her home fic. Due to being a former Replacement!Robin, Merula has backstory-induced amnesia and only a few months of experiences. As such, she&#39;s unsure of not only her place in the world, but of her own personality. She attempts to remedy this by trying to <i>make</i> herself a personality, at least until her partner snaps her out of it by pointing out that she does have a personality: she&#39;s decisive in her actions and choices, and is willing and able to take drastic actions if she views them necessary. Her last name is a reference to velveteen rabbits, due to the noodle incident that was Chenille dropping her off in Medical.<br><br>The two become partners some time after Merula&#39;s recruitment.<br><br><br>These are the only two for now, but I have got an idea for a Kwami agent from <i>Miraculous Ladybug</i> bouncing around the back of my head.</p>

            <p>This is a good one! I really like your writing; it&#39;s one of the few styles that can still just suck me in and have me sitting there reading pages and pages without stopping. And I love the kinds of unexpected ideas you explore in a lot of your works. Especially with the way this one started, where it seemed at first to be heavy-handed metaphor and then turned out to be completely literal. Brilliant, that.<br><br>I really liked this bit, too: <i>Alchemical concoction of memory and prejudice and ambition and the stupid kid-dreams nobody really let go of, not really, no matter how far and how hidden and rotted they were left in the backs of dreary, tired skulls. Glorious, unstable, alchemical Rebis. The stink of personhood–sentience.</i><br><br><i>It smelled like rotted strawberries and paint.</i><br><br>Like, that&#39;s so cool? The way you take this entirely intangible idea which is tangible to the character and then tie it down to a concept that the average real-world reader can pin down.<br><br>You did occasionally use <i>themselves</i> when I think you meant to use <i>themself</i>, but other than that I didn&#39;t see much wrong with it. I really like the way your writing reads like a modernist short story from the sort of person who wants you to think about inexplicable Jesus statues or something but without the drudging aversion to fun. Wish I could write like that.</p>

            <p>Happy Middle-earth Day! March 25th* is the day the Ring was destroyed, and the beginning of the Gondorian new year.<br><br>*Yes, I know... it&#39;s still the 25th <i>somewhere</i>, so it counts.<br><br>To celebrate, I wanted to share some things you may have known, but probably never fully noticed, in a list I like to call...<br><br><u>Three Things You Kind Of Knew About Middle-earth But Not Really</u><br><br><b>1. It&#39;s stuffed with prophecy</b><br><br>One of the things that sets <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> apart from many of its successors is that Frodo is not a Chosen One of Prophecy. There is no ancient wisdom saying he will succeed - just hope.<br><br>But Frodo aside, there is <i>so</i> much prophecy in M-e. Practically everyone can be a prophet! You remember that the Witch-King was prophesied by Glorfindel not to die by the hand of man, but do you remember that Aragorn taking the Paths of the Dead was the subject of prophecy? Malbeth the Seer, who gave that prediction, also prophesied the death of the last king of Arnor (and, given his title, probably other stuff too). Galadriel had her Mirror, of course - but her mentor, Melian, had the same powers, and is actually seen in the Silmarillion prophesying to Galadriel. Then there&#39;s the Prophecy of Mandos, and several attributed to Feanor, and...<br><br>But forget the great and powerful - mere mortals have the same power. Huor, father of Tuor and uncle of Turin, foretold the birth of Earendil - &#39;from you and from me a new star shall arise&#39; - and Aragorn&#39;s mother foresaw her own death in her last farewell to her son. But perhaps the most Tolkien prophecy of all has nothing to do with wars, kings, or Dark Lords - it is a simple, homely thing uttered by Frodo just before his departure, to his dear friend Sam:<br><br><i>&quot;And also you have Rose, and Elanor; and Frodo-lad will come, and Rosie-lass, and Merry, and Goldilocks, and Pippin; and perhaps more that I cannot see. Your hands and your wits will be needed everywhere. You will be the Mayor, of course, as long as you want to be, and the most famous gardener in history.&quot;</i><br><br><b>2. It&#39;s a hotbed of political intrigue</b><br><br>One of the repeated ideas about <i>Game of Thrones</i> is that, unlike Tolkien, it&#39;s written in shades of grey. In Tolkien (the theory goes) the good are Good, and the bad are Bad, with no blurring of the lines between them.<br><br>HAH!<br><br>Let&#39;s forget the First Age, where the most famous elf in history was a mass murderer, and his sons pulled off a soft coup against their cousin and held the princess of a neighbouring power prisoner. Let&#39;s ignore the Second Age, where the kings of Numenor sink from near-elven grace to slave-taking death-worshippers even <i>before</i> they accept Sauron as a friend. We&#39;ll even ignore the history of Arnor in the Third Age, which fell apart due to royal infighting and was then slowly converted and conquered by Angmar. We&#39;ll focus entirely on the holders of one title: the Stewards of Gondor.<br><br>Most people notice that Denethor II is a pretty conflicted and morally-grey figure. He is a staunch fighter against Mordor and Sauron, even hazarding his own mind against him through the Palantir. He loves his sons - one more so, true, but he loves both of them, and despite what certain movies would tell you, doesn&#39;t actually send Faramir off to kill him. In fact, it is Faramir&#39;s near-death that finally breaks him.<br><br>And yet... he spurned the advice of Gandalf. He was caustic, even vicious to those around him. He was at least a little bit racist, believing in the superiority of Numenoreans above other men. And he vehemently opposed the return of the King.<br><br>In that last, he seriously overstepped the bounds of his authority - but there is <i>ample</i> precedent for that in his line. Steward Cirion, five hundred years earlier, essentially sold off a chunk of Gondor to buy Rohan as an ally, and did so by swearing in the name of Eru; invoking that Name required priestly authority which it is far from clear the Stewards had. He also moved the most sacred site in Gondor, deciding for himself that the Tradition of Isildur &#39;was now made void&#39;.<br><br>Or go back further, to Mardil the Steadfast, a thousand years before Denethor. When the last King of Gondor was captured or killed in Minas Morgul, Mardil chose not to perform his duty of chosing a new king - no, he assumed the rule himself, establishing a millennium of Ruling Stewards &#39;until the King returns&#39;. There&#39;s no way that was part of his job description - it was a blatant seizure of power.<br><br>Mardil&#39;s grandfather, Pelendur, also exceeded his authority, and was rewarded for it. He made the choice to reject the claim of King Arvedui of Arnor to the vacant Gondorian throne, instead passing it to a Gondorian general who was a distant cousin to the last king. After his day, we are told, the stewardship became hereditary - which it is hard not to see as a reward from the new King Earnil.<br><br>And it goes still further back, to the very first named Steward, Hurin of Emyn Arnen. He, too, had to deal with the loss of the royal line, with the closest heir being a nephew of the last king. Two years earlier, King Minardil was killed by descendents of exiled King Castamir the Usurper; now his sons both died of the plague. Gondor was weakened, almost crippled - but Umbar, and Castamir&#39;s descendents, were strong, strong enough that their raids reached right into the Gondorian heartlands.<br><br>It does <i>not</i> take a lot of imagination to picture Steward Húrin going to Prince Tarondor, hiding from the plague in Minas Anor, and saying, &quot;There&#39;s a faction - a powerful faction - that wants to pass you over. The Usurper&#39;s descendents are strong - they could renew the watch on Mordor, and repopulate Osgiliath - and then there is the matter of your however-many-times-great grandmother, who wasn&#39;t even Numenorean.<br><br>&quot;Of course I&#39;m on your side - of <i>course</i> I am - and I&#39;m sure I can bring the council around. But first... first I need you to promise something.&quot;<br><br>And after his day, we are told, the kings always chose their stewards from among Hurin&#39;s descendents.<br><br>The Stewards of Gondor - political manipulators of the highest degree, and masters of getting away with it.<br><br><b>3. It&#39;s SUPER haunted</b><br><br>Seriously. Do you realise how haunted Middle-earth is? The Fellowship visit more locations populated by ghosts than by elves! You&#39;ve got the Barrow Downs, where - even if the wights themselves don&#39;t count - Merry was possessed by a spirit two thousand years dead. You&#39;ve got the Dead Marshes, with the silent spectres of armies, and corpse-candles drawing the living down among them. You&#39;ve got Dunharrow, with its cursed Dead Men.<br><br>Then there&#39;s the Nazgul, which are some form of zombie-ghost-lich thing. Rohan (which has a word for &#39;undead&#39; - Eowyn uses it to the Witch-king) has legends of King Helm&#39;s ghost walking the battlements. Dive further back, and you find Gorlim the Unhappy paying a post-death visit to Beren, confessing his betrayal - a classic &#39;unfinished business&#39; spook. Tolkien even tells us straight up that dead Elves can linger on as ghosts, perhaps even possessing the living.<br><br>Nor are spectres the only form of classical undead in Middle-earth. Werewolves? Check (though they might just be large wolves). Vampires? Check (though ditto, they could be just oversized, iron-clawed bats). Necromancy? That&#39;s Sauron&#39;s whole thing for a while. There&#39;s even a Hobbit poem about Mewlips, slimy swamp creatures who carry the bones of their victims in their sacks.<br><br>Forget mermaids, unicorns, fairies and genies - if you want to add a new species to Middle-earth, the way to hew most closely to Tolkien&#39;s vision is to make it some form of horrifying undead monster.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I&#39;m guessing if you were to add an undead species to M-e, they&#39;d be malevolent judging by the rest of the undead inhabitants? Or if not malevolent, at the very least cursed? So it wouldn&#39;t work too well for a Sue species that wanted to mesh with canon. :P</p>

            <p>And in fairness, there&#39;s a much wider variety of magical creatures in the Legendarium than people generally think. It&#39;s just... y&#39;know... most of them are evil.<br><br>But there are early stories with mermaids, playful sprites, and air-spirits called sylphs; these were probably superseded by the Maiar, but there&#39;s no <i>proof</i> of that (and Goldberry, for instance, is pretty clearly a water-nymph of some description). There&#39;s an Elvish word for &#39;dryad&#39;, giants in <i>The Hobbit</i>, sea-serpents and legends of island-sized turtle-fish... frankly, given that Tom Bombadil knows talking badgers, and a thinking fox has a run in with Frodo, Sam, and Pippin, there&#39;s not really a discernable difference between the bestiary of Middle-earth and that of Narnia.<br><br>But no unicorns, pegasi, or tiny flitty fairies. We have to draw the line somewhere. :)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I don&#39;t compose my own very much, but I am trying to do an original piano/vocal arrangement of the funeral song for Boromir from chapter one of <i>The Two Towers</i>. So far I&#39;ve only written the vocal part, and I&#39;m pretty happy with where it&#39;s at, but I&#39;d like a second opinion. So if anyone knows sheet music I&#39;d be much obliged if you could <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aKZ9DAJWQER6a8NXgv2B7POCcwb62qLG/view?usp=sharing">take a look</a> and tell me:<br><br>1. Does it make sense?<br>2. Does it sound good?<br>3. Does it seem like a good melody that works with the words instead of just kind of existing alongside them?<br>4. Anything else you think needs said about it.<br><br>Thanks in advance! (And yes, I know my real name is in the PDF. It&#39;s okay.)</p>

            <p>I don&#39;t read music well enough to get the tune just by looking at it, but as someone who&#39;s sung in choirs my whole life, I do have some thoughts!<br><br>The first thing that jumps out at me is the slurs/melismas. Most if not all of them are probably unnecessary; the reading of the text will give the proper phrasing to any director or singer worth their salt. What you might do instead is mark places where your intended musical phrasing is different from what it might seem to be, for instance if you <i>don&#39;t</i> intend for a pause someplace there&#39;s a comma, or if you&#39;d suggest a breath somewhere other than at a comma or a rest.<br><br>The next thing I noticed is that the spacing between the staves is inconsistent. This might be an issue with the program you&#39;re using, so I don&#39;t know how much you can do about it, but if there&#39;s any way to get them evenly spaced on every page, that would be nice.<br><br>Possibly related to this, your dynamic marks seem to be closer to the bottom of the staff above them than the top of the staff below, which is kind of odd. I&#39;m not sure if you placed them there deliberately or if it just looks that way because of the spacing of the staves, but normally dynamic marks go above the staff.<br><br>A couple things on the last page:<br><br>1. The staccato marks at 105-7. Do you actually intend for those notes to be sung short and detached? Seems surprising, maybe even out of place, since there&#39;s nothing like that in the rest of the piece. If you intend to emphasize those notes, maybe marcatos or tenutos would be better? Or, instead of suddenly marking up a cluster of notes, perhaps a direction such as <s>once more, with feeling</s> accentato?<br><br>2. The bunch of fermatas at the end. I&#39;d suggest simply indicating a ritardando instead, with a single fermata on the last note. Much cleaner notation, same effect.<br><br>I do have MuseScore, so I&#39;ll see if it&#39;ll read the PDF and let me hear the actual tune. {= )<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Thanks for the advice. I&#39;m working it in now. That&#39;s a good point with the slurs. It&#39;s been so long since I&#39;ve sung in a choir that I didn&#39;t really remember what they were for. As for the spacing between the staves, well, I use MuseScore. If you can tell me a way to <i>change</i> the spacing between the staves, you&#39;ll have won my undying respect and admiration. (This one also looks a little weird because I pulled the vocal part out of a document that also had space for a piano accompaniment that I haven&#39;t written yet. I didn&#39;t want to waste space.)<br><br>I&#39;m going to be perfectly honest, I took one basic music theory class that only got as far as chords and everything else I know about music is what I could pick up from reading it. (A lot of this honestly seems to be that I simply didn&#39;t know there was a better option.)<br><br>Anyway, since we both have MuseScore, <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/18dIHdwSJEHKJm0_6YjLzUtJLB6TLjHX8/view?usp=sharing">here&#39;s</a> the .mscz. I mean, the .pdf was made with MuseScore so MuseScore can probably read it. Theoretically.<br><br>Thanks for the input!</p>

            <p>What&#39;s the tempo? I don&#39;t think it&#39;s marked down... I&#39;d imagine it&#39;s somewhere in the 60-80 bpm range, but a more exact number will help.</p>

            <p>Actually, when I wrote it I was thinking 120. I wasn&#39;t really setting out to write a dirge, though I also experimented with slower speeds. It also works pretty well at 80, I think (although there&#39;s a very small chance of me attempting to <i>sing</i> it at 80).<br><br>But this is why I&#39;m looking for other people&#39;s opinions. Is that too fast? Would it sound weird, given the content, to go at that speed? (I&#39;ve been singing this song to myself, to almost this exact tune, for over fifteen years now, so I really wouldn&#39;t know if I&#39;m going too fast at this point.)<br><br>Thanks for having a look, anyhow! :P</p>

            <p>No, 120 is fine. I don&#39;t know the tune off-hand, so I kinda assumed it was on the slow side.<br><br>Now that I think about it, it makes more sense at a faster tempo.</p>

            <p>Here&#39;s one piece of advice right here and now, however: Posting the link to your document publicly BEFORE the beta-reading process generally isn&#39;t recommended. Public links on the Board generally mean that a work has already been reviewed by several people who have agreed to inspect it beforehand, as opposed to putting up a public link asking for reviews via crowdsourcing. The latter MIGHT be more applicable on a Discord server for example, but as a means of general feedback rather than a full beta-reading.<br><br>Since the link is already out there, though, I assume your permissions on the doc were set to &quot;anyone can read, but only you can edit&quot;? This would minimize the risk of people coming across the link and tampering with the document without your consent. Then when certain people agree to check for issues such as SPaG, you can give them permission to edit as well.<br><br>That&#39;s just my two Pokémon Dollars, and I&#39;m not sure about others&#39; reactions (though I doubt there&#39;d be much disagreement tbh). If it&#39;s any compensation, though, I&#39;ll still be willing to check out the Permission attempt itself as a beta-reader if only for grammar-checking purposes (though canon familiarity always helps, of course). My Discord is also available on request if you want feedback a bit sooner.</p>

            <p>I really like how you use the piles of books to show the contrast in the two agents&#39; reading interests, but also that they aren&#39;t what I expected each agent to be interested in.  It&#39;s cool that May, the more calm and serious one, is into the more schlocky fiction, while Melissa, the less mature one, prefers the deep, rich fantasy settings.<br><br>It&#39;s definitely fun thinking about trades!  As a community, we need to expand on the General Store more.<br><br>The author&#39;s note (heh) and gifts were cute.  It reminds me of the LiveJournal RPs of old, where Artemis and Teena and such would hang out with their agents in universe.  Good to know the authors are still keeping tabs on things, even if they don&#39;t swing around to visit any more!<br><br>—doctorlit</p>

            <p>That ought to get people&#39;s attention. ^<em>~<br><br>And they ought to pay attention, because this was a good mission! The fic is godawfully disgusting and almost certainly a troll, but the mission handles it adroitly, providing just enough information to show that it&#39;s awful without dwelling on it enough to make the audience suffer. Not as much as the agents, anyway.<br><br>There were a few good moments that made me snicker, but I think my favorite is the unexpected scene transition. It was a brilliant way to extend the story without it feeling forced, and funny to boot. ^</em>^<br><br>I mostly agree with doctorlit about Sean, too. I absolutely buy him being dazed, confused, and of little to no practical help. My one criticism is that, even dazed and confused, he should still be Agent Sean. I find it hard to believe he could have his face in a girl&#39;s cleavage after who-knows-how-long in that plothole and not so much as grin about it. There in particular, he reads less as &quot;dazed&quot; and more as &quot;sedated.&quot; Remember, he dated Luxury, and he&#39;s the one of the pair who actually hit on Jay. He&#39;s about as much of a pervert as Lux is. {= )<br><br>That said, I did like his interactions with Melissa overall. They could all probably be played up a little more so they&#39;re presented as deliberate actions on Sean&#39;s part rather than as things that are passively happening to Melissa, but it&#39;s just the cleavage thing that really struck me as OOC.<br><br>... And oh god, it just hit me again... the poor Medical staff. Heck, poor Logan. (Or &quot;Steve,&quot; lol, don&#39;t they know <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolverine_(character)#Fictional_character_biography">his name is Jimmy?</a>) None of them deserved that. I&#39;m not sure whether to laugh or cry. The agents had <i>better</i> help them out! <s>But at least the Flowers won&#39;t lack for fertilizer anytime soon...</s><br><br>Good job, and here&#39;s hoping Melissa and May&#39;s next mission is not this horrible. {= )<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I&#39;m really glad to hear that you&#39;ve enjoyed the mission. (Tell me, which were the parts that made you laugh? I&#39;m not a native English speaker, and writing comedy in my second language is kind of tough, so I really appreciate any feedback on my work.)<br>And you&#39;re right, the cleavage thing is a character moment I should have caught while editing. Oh, well... I have plans anyway to feature Sean in the future, and hopefully by then I&#39;ll have a better grip on his character.<br>As for the next mission... it isn&#39;t *quite* as disgusting as this one, but that&#39;s a pretty low bar. All I&#39;ll say is that copious amounts of Bleepka are going to be involved. :D</p>

            <p>This mission was some tricky subject matter, but I think you handled it well.  You kept direct quotes from the fic down to a bare minimum, which gave me just enough information to know what was going on without forcing clear mental images on me.  It&#39;s also a good choice in this case to have the agents check ahead and prevent some of the worst stuff from occurring at all—not just the scatological stuff, but also the nuclear explosion.  Cleaning up a canon city from that kind of destruction could be an interesting interlude on its own, but would be a bit too much to tag onto the end of a short mission.<br><br>It&#39;s been a long time since I read any of Sean&#39;s previous appearances (I had forgotten he had blue hair and piercings), but I at least feel like you&#39;ve done his character justice.  It would have been a mistake to make him overconfident and domineering just because he&#39;s an Original Series character; I think keeping him meek and submissive, even towards the newbies, was the right way to go.  Especially considering he&#39;s apparently been wandering Middle-earth for decades up until this mission.  I do love that even after being gone for decades, the Queen Anne&#39;s Lace immediately sends him on a training mission right after he got back!<br><br>I like the pair of agents you&#39;ve introduced, with a rash but active one and a more reserved but overly analytical one.  I think they&#39;ll make for a good team going forward.  I would like a  little consistency on Hurley&#39;s name, though.  In this short story, she&#39;s referred to alternatively as &quot;Melissa&quot; and &quot;Hurley&quot; throughout, and then says near the end to call her &quot;Lissa.&quot;  I would think she&#39;s more likely to bring up her preferred nickname when she first introduces herself to her partner or Sean.  Keeping each character&#39;s name consistent helps the reader keep track of dialogue tags and action when a lot of characters are on-page at once.<br><br>I like that you included the moment where Hurley shows sympathy for Sam.  I agree with her lack of fondness for the live-action <i>Transformers</i> films, but I also agree that this fic went way too far in its treatment of Sam, and I like that the narration there serves as both an in- and out-of universe acknowledgement of that.<br><br>I do want to point out that you sometimes split a single character&#39;s action and dialogue into multiple paragraphs.  It makes for easier reading when those things are kept together.  For example, in the exchange:<br><br><i>“This… that’s… oy,” she spluttered. “They’re giving us that for our first mission?!”<br><br>Melissa snarled.<br><br>“I’m going to kill someone,” she spat, and was out the door before May could react.</i><br><br>The first paragraph has May speaking.  A new paragraph starts, which my brain expects to be about Hurley, and that proves correct.  Then another paragraphs starts, which my brain expects to switch back to May, but instead, it continues Hurley-based action, with May only getting mentioned at the end.  It would read better as:<br><br><i>“This… that’s… oy,” she spluttered. “They’re giving us that for our first mission?!”<br><br>Melissa snarled.  “I’m going to kill someone,” she spat, and was out the door before May could react.</i><br><br>Keep an eye out as you write for places like that.<br><br>Also, one little typo:<br><i>&quot;Scene change, God and the author only <b>knows</b>, and hey, Jean Grey’s arrived!&quot;</i><br><br>That middle fragment has a plural subject (&quot;God and the author&quot;), so the following verb should be &quot;know&quot; instead of &quot;knows.&quot;<br><br>—doctorlit, eating second breakfast</p>

            <p>I&#39;m very happy to hear that you liked the mission. As for the issues you mentioned, I&#39;m afraid those turn up frequently in my fics. I&#39;m Hungarian, and sometimes I tend to follow Hungarian spelling rules (such as separating actions and dialogue) instead of English ones.

            <p>To me, this was a most excellent first outing. That being said however I do have some complaints. And by some I mean two.<br><br>I feel like you should&#39;ve spent slightly more time establishing setting in the beginning. To me it felt like I was just dropped into the story with no prior... I want to say agency.<br><br>Second, I feel like Sean should&#39;ve been at least a little deadpan. A good John Mulaney &quot;Same [crap] as always&quot; here, a nice snark off there. He&#39;s a veteran teaching the ropes to some agents who don&#39;t quite know what they&#39;re doing yet, and the way you had him written felt off balance between the rest of the mission&#39;s cast.</p>

            <p>...I don&#39;t entirely agree with you on Sean. I can definitely see where you&#39;re coming from, but I didn&#39;t really see him in TOS as a particularly snarky character, at least no more than Luxury is - and I feel that, after being lost for decades without even being aware of it (my headcanon is that time works funny in plotholes as well as HQ), maybe it is justified for him to be a little dazed.<br>Still, it&#39;s just that we seem to have different interpretations of the character, and I&#39;m glad to hear that otherwise you liked the mission.
