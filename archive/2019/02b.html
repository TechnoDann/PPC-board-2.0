            <p>by <s>J.K. Rowling</s> Newton Artemis Fido Scamander, allegedly!  To be clear, this is the book, not the films.  I haven’t seen those, and don’t particularly feel any great draw to do so, for some reason.<br><br>Do I still warn for spoilers when the book is composed almost entirely of summaries of organisms?  Of course I do.  Reading is an experience, regardless of the content.  Spoiler warning for the book <i>Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them</i>, but not for the films, probably?  I don’t exactly know what the films took from the book, really.<br><br>I’ve been looking forward to reading this for a while, though I’m not really sure what I was expecting.  Although I enjoyed the “beastiary” section well enough, I actually found the introductory sections, about the history of classifying magic organisms, and the pains the Wizarding World goes to in continuing to hide them from Muggles.  I think I would have preferred a lot more content in that section.  In fact, that kind of answered a question I had never really articulated to myself: why do the magic animals need to be hidden at all?  Why wouldn’t Muggles just accept, for example, that unicorns are just an odd member of the <i>Equus</i> genus?  For some species, like dragons, it could be written off as protecting Muggles from dangerous organisms, and for others, it could be to prevent poaching.  But now I see I’ve been wrong to think of “magical beasts” as just “animals, but different.”  Some of them are indeed magical themselves, and would demonstrate to Muggles that parts of their physics is wrong.  Others were produced purely by magic, and would seem to break the rules of biology, again showing Muggles that there was more to the world than they realized.  (Would an analysis of basilisk DNA reveal it to be a combination of chicken and toad DNA?  I somehow doubt that—the toad only warms the egg, but then . . . what is a basilisk’s DNA?  It’s clearly not pure chicken!)  And some beasts are pretty clearly not organic at all, or at least I don’t think so.  The Lethifold seems to be an enchanted sheet or cloak, although perhaps I’m wrong there; fabric shouldn’t be able or required to digest food.<br><br>The tone of the actual beast entries varies from the purely humorous and whimsical to the dark and creepy, just like the actual <i>Harry Potter</i> series itself.  It’s pretty clear that they share the same author (no offense to Mr. Scamander).  Funnily enough, that also makes the magic beasts feel that much more like real animals: the Muggle world has its even share of frightening, dangerous big cats, monitor lizards and thick-skinned giant grey mammals, but also the small and tamable rodents, songbirds and pets.  It seems reasonable that the same range would be present in magically produced or influenced organisms.<br><br>I know it’s a little mini-book made for charity, but boy oh boy, would I love to read the actual, full in-universe text.  (You can’t tell me Hogwarts has for decades used an 88-page book as the primary text for one of its classes!)<br><br>—doctorlit will have to find a copy of <i>Quidditch Through the Ages</i> eventually, though he is not looking forward to the sportsball book, even if it is about magic sportsball</p>

            <p>Due to the ongoing Shenanigans<sup>TM</sup> on both sides of the Atlantic, I&#39;ve been thinking a fair bit about the role of the opposition. (The specific prompt for this was seeing Jeremy Corbyn lambasted for not supporting a People&#39;s Vote, in exactly the same way that he was lambasted for not calling for a vote of no confidence... which he did... and then lost... so what did that achieve, again?) Specifically, the fact that in both our forms of democracy, the opposition is supposed to be just as invested in the good of the country, but with a different view on how to achieve it. In UK parlance, they are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Her_Majesty%27s_Most_Loyal_Opposition_(United_Kingdom)">Her Majesty&#39;s Most Loyal Opposition</a>.<br><br>And that got me thinking, as is my wont, about fiction. How often in fiction is there a Loyal Opposition? For that matter, how often is there an actual Opposition at all, rather than straight-up rebels? It&#39;s a really interesting concept, but most of the time it gets reduced either to &#39;hi, I&#39;m the Sultan and this is my Vizer, Sneery Al-Twirlymoustache&#39;, or to &#39;the government is literal demons and we ousted politicians must fight them&#39;.<br><br>A few examples which occur to me of actual Oppositions:<br><br>-The dynamic between Denethor and Gandalf in <i>Return of the King</i>. Both of them are trying to do what&#39;s best for Gondor, but they have wildly different ideas about how. Complicated by the fact that Denethor is under evil influence, and Gandalf has no official power in the first place.<br><br>-David Weber&#39;s Honor Harrington books. These devote a <i>lot</i> of time to parliamentary politics, with the good guys being both the government and the opposition at times. The problem is, Weber fervently paints the other side - whether it&#39;s the Manticoran Conservatives &amp; Liberals, or the Havenites following Giancola - as utterly evil and corrupt. There is no Loyal Opposition, because the Opposition (or the government, for a while) is working for itself, not for the country.<br><br>-The Republic Senate in the <i>Star Wars</i> prequels. Ignoring the fact that Palpatine is evil (because his government don&#39;t really know that), Amidala and her allies seem to form an unofficial opposition, working against the increasing centralisation of power on the Chancellor, while still supporting the Republic. This got a bit more attention in the old EU; I don&#39;t think there&#39;s much in the new canon.<br><br>... I might be tired, but there&#39;s not much else that&#39;s springing to mind. Maybe it&#39;s because fiction thrives on conflict, and &#39;they are evil, we must beat them&#39; is the easiest kind of conflict. There&#39;s something faintly unsatisfying about &#39;we got our way, but the other side also had a viable plan, and next time they might win the day&#39;. It doesn&#39;t lend itself to proper conclusions - you don&#39;t get The Heroes overcoming The Enemy - but I feel like there&#39;s a lot of space to explore in the concept?<br><br>The thing is, I&#39;m sure it <i>has</i> been done. So now it&#39;s up to you to share how. ^_^<br><br>(Within the PPC, I imagine the Sub Rosa often taking on the Opposition role; it seems like her kind of deal. And of course, there&#39;s the Notary...)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Obviously not in regards to the Alliance/Horde conflict, but various subgroups within those factions each vying to make themselves heard and push what they think is the best agenda for each faction.<br><br>Take the kingdoms of Stormwind and Gilneas, for example. They both support the Alliance, but they have different ideas of how to do it. Stormwind are definitely the Gryffindors of the bunch—wanting to rush into a fight to get the drop on their enemies. Gilneas was reluctantly dragged into the war after the Horde sacked their kingdom, and they&#39;re much more likely to call for defensive measures and scouting tactics before jumping into a fight (unless the Forsaken are involved, in which case, all bets are off).</p>

            <p>... Hogwarts. Not in the present, but at founding. Even if you posit Slytherin as eeeeeeevil (which I don&#39;t), you still have three people with very different views on what makes a good student, all working together to build a school. I mean, you <i>know</i> Helga occasionally had to resort to closing the kitchens to get the other three to see sense, while Rowena&#39;s preferred tactic was to explain at tedious length exactly why she was right until they gave in. ^_^<br><br>Going back to WoW, I can see how the MMO setup would be ripe for this: it lets you set up sub-conflicts beneath your main one, without there being a Secretly Evil faction involved. The more players you have, the more complexity you can work in.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>... Okay, when I started writing this post, I was completely convinced there used to be such a thing as a naysmith, whose job it was to challenge the assumptions of the other people making the important decisions, like the Notary on the Continuity Council. Now that I Google it, though, I find no support for this. Apparently the surname Naysmith or Naismith comes from the occupation of a cutler. Did I make this up? O.o<br><br>Well, that aside... you could cast someone like that as a hero in a story. Maybe the people they&#39;re arguing with aren&#39;t even wrong, they just don&#39;t have all the information, and it&#39;s up to the loyal opponent to find it before it&#39;s too  late?<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I wrote the current version of that wiki page! Glad you <s>don&#39;t dis</s>approve. {= D<br><br>I don&#39;t know if you&#39;d remember much from back then, or would have any bits of writing still hanging around on a computer, but as one of our self-appointed historians, I&#39;d love to hear anything you&#39;ve got. There are a few things about the Troll Division that weren&#39;t quite established, such as what Fixie Dust and Grapnades are, and how &quot;sunning&quot; a troll actually <i>worked</i>, and it&#39;s not every day you get to talk to a primary source. Plus, I like the one Troll Division story there is a lot, and I wish there had been more. ^_^<br><br>~Neshomeh, who joined roughly mid-2003.</p>

            <p>I totally approve!  I don&#39;t really have any of that info anymore- I just remember it was a collaborative piece between the three of us. I still do have my, oof, pretty bad fanfic up that is mentioned in the story &quot;Legolas and the Mermaid&quot;.  It&#39;s on fanfic.net under &quot;Leelee5&quot; (<a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1152199/1/The-Mermaid-and-Legolas"><a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1152199/1/The-Mermaid-and-Legolas">https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1152199/1/The-Mermaid-and-Legolas</a></a>)  <br><br>I think I sent this story into a contest, which is what led me to the PPC?  I know I then migrated to God Awful Fanfiction website, which had an easier message board system for me to follow.   <br><br>I was using AOL back in 2003, which never saved group chat or emails, so sadly, I just don&#39;t have the info.  Nothing dramatic happened between the authors, I think we just all went our separate ways.</p>

We see an established Suethor (In one episode of the western, Rance the self-insert had fallen from 800 ft./≈244 m. onto a horse without killing either himself, the horse, or its rider) setting up a fic that throws Jesse James so far OOC he actually comes back to the land of the living to get some sense knocked into McGrew.</p>

            <p>(Do they count as spoilers when they&#39;re for a trailer?)<br><br>Things I spotted:<br><br>-Elsa doing magical research is really interesting! She doesn&#39;t seem to be trying to achieve a specific goal, just to &quot;test [her] limits/and break through&quot;.<br><br>-The alien invasion is... spooky. Are they purple/pink, to match the fire Elsa&#39;s fighting off later? There seem to be three different designs: concentric diamonds, a bird-foot with dots, and a teardrop/tree that looks lighter in colour.<br><br>-Nothing much to say about the Charge of the Sven Brigade, except that I think those trees are some kind of beech.<br><br>-It looks like Anna gets trapped somewhere, underground or down a ravine or something. Her clothes match the autumn scene from later.<br><br>-Magical fire! In a vague heart-shape, for anyone still hoping for Elsa/fire-queen &#39;shipping. ^_~<br><br>-New character! I actually get <i>Brave</i> vibes off the whole of Autumn Land, though this definitely isn&#39;t Merida. I think the magical pop-up is Anna, but I&#39;m not positive.<br><br>-Aaaaand hero shot, where the gang discovers... autumn? I don&#39;t really know, there&#39;s no reason &#39;gasp - trees, but orange!&#39; should be a thing. But apparently, per the stinger, there&#39;s... something in the woods?<br><br>Kaitlyn pointed out that the aesthetic seems to draw a bit from <i>Coco</i>, for which they clearly invented a leaf-simulator. It looks a lot darker than <i>Frozen</i> itself, colour-wise (the plot of <i>Frozen</i> is pretty darn dark), so... yeah, looks good.<br><br><i>Dangit Disney I need some of my money.</i><br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Disclaimer, I haven&#39;t watched the trailer<br><br>Are they, like, literally described as aliens, or are you just calling them aliens casually? Because if they&#39;re actual aliens, in a freaking fairy tale world, I have a huge problem with this. Also, the designs, from your description, are way too sci-fi for a fairy tale world. I know that Disney&#39;s trying to break tropes to keep themselves in good standing with increasingly feminist parents, but honestly, making sense and fitting into the story comes first.<br><br>I also have problems with what really seems like Disney giving in to the Frozen fanfic/making fanfic-level of sense. The discovery of autumn sounds like someone&#39;s building off of the mistaken assumption that it&#39;s winter all the time in Arendelle. Although I do admit that fire is the logical next step if you already have an ice character, that&#39;s also what most fanfic writers use for the other character/their first Elsa recolor/Anna&#39;s headcanon powers. The vague heart-shape is probably you overanalyzing, although the idea of Disney giving Elsa a girlfriend isn&#39;t as impossible to me as I once thought, as they do already have gay characters in their TV shows. On the other hand, those are targeted towards older kids, whereas anything with princesses is for younger kids, and you know how the younger the kid is, the more threatened the parents feel if they run across something in kids&#39; media they don&#39;t like...<br><br>I&#39;m probably overreacting, but that&#39;s what happens when I dig into the <i>Frozen</i> fandom and find that the most popular ship is Annacest.<br><br>-Twistey</p>

            <p>There&#39;s a shot of Anna running onto a balcony to see a host of floating crystal things in blue/purple colours, with little designs on them. It&#39;s totally an alien invasion. ^_^<br><br>I <i>think</i> the whole autumn thing is just them travelling to another land, with the teaser using it to set a different-season theme in a film that isn&#39;t actually about the discovery of autumn. The comment about the heart-shaped fire was pretty tongue-in-cheek; it&#39;s an idea that&#39;s bounced around the internet for a <i>long</i> time, but there&#39;s no reason to think Disney have even heard about it.<br><br>And... it&#39;s not surprising that the shipping in <i>Frozen</i> fandom is pretty messed up. The characters available are: two princesses, a manipulative villain, a human weasel, a reindeer and his human buddy, some rock trolls... and a snowman. Elsa and <s>Human Sven</s> Kristoff never really talk, so unless you want the canon ship or to include a literal villain, who <i>are</i> you going to go for?<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>So it does actually sound good. Well then. I guess it&#39;ll just be like the first <i>Frozen</i>, good until the hype kills it.<br><br>As for the shipping, that is why I advocate the creation of fan-characters... and why everyone else advocates the nonsensical kidnapping of Jack Frost from <i>Rise of the Guardians</i> to be Elsa&#39;s boyfriend.<br><br>-Twistey</p>

            <p>Since I wasn&#39;t able to get to my sketchbook this week, instead of an art update, y&#39;all who are interested get a bit of trivia!<br><br>All the Knights&#39; names are intentionally selected so that they match names I liked at the time they each represent. This means that all but one are borrowed from persona-type OCs I created during those times.<br><br>- Cass Kingside is my planned Newgrounds pseudonym.<br><br>- Update, I&#39;m changing Myla&#39;s name to Luna, because I&#39;d been thinking of naming her that originally, but at the time, the OC &quot;Luna&quot; was still active, and I don&#39;t like having multiple characters with the same name. I threw away the story recently, and so the option to do this was opened.<br>- (Who was Luna? Luna was me, Sue-ified. You&#39;ll learn more about her in another post.)<br>- (And as for the name &quot;Myla&quot;, it&#39;s an alternate spelling of a shortened version of &quot;Ludmila&quot;, the female lead in a very odd opera I learned to love at the time.)<br><br>- Sakura was a character I made for a role-playing group I briefly had with my school friends. She went by the nickname Mountaineer because of her earth powers, but her real name was Sakura, because I overused Japanese names a lot. She later became the basis for one of my agents-to-be, Amber Callahan.<br><br>- Jacqueline was one of my first OCs, and definitely a Mary Sue. She was a Viking from Berk and fought alongside Samurai Jack. *Snrk*<br><br>- Elinya was one of the many characters I briefly invented for a single session of dress-up. Her name was &quot;Elina&quot; (the character Barbie plays in &quot;Barbie: Fairytopia&quot;) plus a y.<br><br>- The name &quot;Aldegund&quot; was never actually used for any characters I had, as it sounded a bit unwieldy, but I know I eyed it. It&#39;s an ancient Germanic name meaning &quot;old war&quot;.<br><br>- Scarlet was my character in a recurring RP I did with Moon Moon, called &quot;Path Wars&quot;. Because it was Pathfinder (the D&amp;D offshoot), plus Star Wars... plus Minecraft? With our hypothetical mods? Anyway, she was definitely a servant of the Emperor, and used Nether Star amulets (my creation) to augment her power.<br><br>- Teyori was a medieval-ized name for me, Twistey. The name was used in a fanfic I planned to write involving a friend and I being stuck in Stephen King&#39;s book <i>The Eyes of the Dragon</i> and having to find the portal out of the continuum. Interestingly enough, that fanfic yielded a concept I created for a multiverse like the PPC&#39;s... except worse. Yeah.<br><br>Alright, that&#39;s it for Knights trivia!<br><br>-Twistey</p>

            <p>It would explain the use of the Ring poem, and the presence of Lindon. It would also explain why they&#39;ve left a conspicuous space to the east of the &#39;Eriador&#39; label - they can&#39;t stick Arthedain in there easily (it would need to share space with said label), but Eregion would fit nicely.<br><br>The two big problems are:<br><br>-Calenardhon is a Sindarin name, but the population at that time were Men of Darkness. Sindarin wasn&#39;t used by the Numenoreans who poked their noses in, only by the later Gondorians.<br>-The East Bight appears in Mirkwood, which was probably cut in the mid-Third Age.

            <p>Actually, first, allow me to refer you to PoorCynic&#39;s workshops on <a href="https://ppc.fandom.com/wiki/User_blog:PoorCynic/Workshop_One:_Characters">characters</a> and <a href="https://ppc.fandom.com/wiki/User_blog:PoorCynic/Workshop_Two:_Speech">speech</a>. There&#39;s a ton of good advice in there, and it&#39;ll save my fingers. ^<em>^<br><br>Now, to elaborate a bit on what&#39;s in there: <i>how</i> do you determine what unique word choices to give your characters? PC touches on this a little—a coarse character may swear a lot, a sociology student will talk differently than a high-school educated person, etc. But what does that mean?<br><br>Here are three things to consider when finding your character&#39;s voice.<br><br><b>1. Background</b><br><br>Where did your character grow up? What kind of language and speech cadences did they hear around them as a child? Someone from a big city might speak more briskly, use more blunt language, and use choppier sentences than someone from the rural South, where life happens in less of a hurry and more emphasis is placed on manners than rapid conveyance of information. People from different countries, who may or may not have English as their first language, also speak with different rhythms, variant vocabulary, and possibly nonstandard grammar (following the habits of their first language).<br><br>Also, some families are more inclined to get loud with each other than others. You can convey intensity of speech with shorter, simpler sentences without having to resort to lots of italics and exclamation marks, but you can use those tools (sparingly) to set one character apart from another, too.<br><br><b>2. Education</b><br><br>This is a biggie. How much, where, and how your character was educated is possibly the biggest influence on how they speak as an adult, because like the clothes we wear, it&#39;s a huge part of how we choose to present ourselves to others—although, in moments of great stress or excitement, people tend to revert to the mannerisms they learned as a child.<br><br>A quick way to set a highly educated person apart from a less educated person is the percentage of Latin- and Greek-derived words they use. Someone with a college-level education knows more of the fancy Latinate synonyms to the simple Anglo-Saxon building blocks of English, and uses them naturally. They&#39;ll also speak with stricter grammar than someone who has never known or cared what a split infinitive is.<br><br>It&#39;s important to note here that &quot;less educated&quot; does not mean less intelligent. Intelligence is reflected in one&#39;s ability to process information and make good decisions about what to do with it. The more world experience you have, the easier this gets, but just because someone has lived a more isolated, less complex life does not make them stupid.<br><br>The exact <i>kind</i> of education your character to has will influence their way of thinking, and therefore their way of speaking, even further. That sociology student thinks and expresses themself in sociology terms. A movie director thinks in terms of cinema. A politician (theoretically) is always thinking about the impact their speech will have on people&#39;s perception of them. A self-taught entrepreneur will also have self-made speech habits, drawing from the books they&#39;ve read and the people they know.<br><br>The point here is that people learn to speak in ways that most effectively convey their interests (helps us make friends), and status (we all value this to some extent), and intent (helps us get what we want) to the people around them. An educated person who has learned to communicate with similarly educated people has a different set of tools for doing this than a less educated person who has learned to communicate with less educated people.<br><br><b>3. Personality</b><br><br>This is perhaps the finest level of refinement when it comes to speech. A character&#39;s background and education give them certain tools in their linguistic toolbox. Their personality determines when and how they choose to use those tools. A selfish person might talk about themself most of the time and use the highest status speech they know to impress. A considerate person listens to and asks relevant questions of others, and leaves themself out of it. A happy, excitable person has a faster cadence and uses shorter, bubblier words than a taciturn one.<br><br>Personality determines the amount of swearing one chooses to use, whereas their background and education determine exactly how they do it.<br><br>Personal interests and hobbies can influence the figurative language a character uses. Someone who loves music may use musical metaphors and similes. Someone who loves math may explain things in terms of equations and functions. Someone who loves <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> may quote the books and/or films to make a point.<br><br>And so on, and so forth.<br><br><br>I hope that helps! Speech is complex, because it&#39;s completely wrapped up in the sociology and psychology of human beings. To really understand it, you have to understand people. It&#39;s hard, but you can get pretty far just by listening attentively to how other people talk and paying attention to how other writers do dialogue. Personally, it&#39;s my favorite thing to write, and I&#39;ve put a lot of thought into it. I&#39;m happy to talk about it more if you have more questions. ^</em>^<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Me being me, I haven&#39;t stopped thinking about this topic, and it occurred to me that an excellent demonstration of how complex writing speech gets is the vast number of options you have when it comes to a simple greeting. Rather than trying to discuss them all, though, I&#39;m going to give you five, and you (if you so choose) will respond with what you infer about the speaker, based on their choice of greeting alone.<br><br>We&#39;ll assume each speaker has just been greeted by a neutral-to-friendly but unknown person in a neutral setting, such as a social gathering, where it would not be weird for someone to strike up a conversation.<br><br><b>1.</b> Hail and well met.<br><br><b>2.</b> Good afternoon.<br><br><b>3.</b> Hi!<br><br><b>4.</b> Yo, what&#39;s up?<br><br><b>5.</b> What do you want?<br><br>So, what can you tell about each of these speakers? There&#39;s no one right answer, so don&#39;t be shy! The point is here to flex your mental muscles and to demonstrate just how powerful word choice (and punctuation!) is. {= )<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>You and Thoth (and S.M.F., even) seem to have come up with sort of external answers to who these speakers are, whereas what I had in mind when I chose them was all about internal mood and general demeanor. The responses are arranged on a rough scale of formality to informality, with (possibly) inappropriate extremes on both ends and varying degrees of sociability. I think you both touched on the internals indirectly, Thoth more directly in his &quot;Why&quot; response, but perhaps at first you took it as a given or weren&#39;t really aware of perceiving it? Or just weren&#39;t taking the thing seriously? {= P<br><br>You both came up with sets of five very different characters based on a very little sample of speech, though, and if you wanted to, you could probably keep writing speech in their voices without much chance of confusing one for the other. Well, excepting the CAPTCHA and the Generic Shopkeeper NPC, which probably don&#39;t have much else to say. Why&#39;d you guys balk at seeing those speakers as real people, but not as much at the others? You might want to examine your biases a little. If we&#39;re not careful, we humans are very good at making snap judgements about other people based on how <s>differently from us</s> they talk. {= )<br><br>Anyway... I do hope this was at least a little bit helpful to SunAndMoon. Or anyone.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I&#39;ll assume a modern, Western setting for all of these, for Consistency(TM).<br><br><b>1. Hail and well met.</b><br><br>This person is an introvert, playing up their misfit nature as a defense mechanism: &#39;you can&#39;t make fun of me if I&#39;m over-the-top about it&#39;. They&#39;re liable to get worn out by the effort of social interaction, so will become more and more withdrawn as the event goes on.<br><br><b>2. Good afternoon.</b><br><br>This person is exquisitely uncomfortable. They&#39;re younger than most people around them, and feel like they need to make a good impression on everybody. There&#39;s no end goal to that: that&#39;s just how they approach social settings like this.<br><br><b>3. Hi!</b><br><br>This person is just a bit too cheerful to be believable; I think it&#39;s because they don&#39;t immediately follow up with a perky question. They&#39;ve had a bad day, on a personal level (an argument with a friend, maybe?) and are now deliberately trying to quash it and Just Enjoy Themselves.<br><br><b>4. Yo, what&#39;s up?</b><br><br>This person <s>is stuck in the &#39;90s</s> is very distracted: they&#39;ve given the stranger a response they&#39;d normally give to a friend. I think they&#39;re waiting for someone. They&#39;re the sort of person who gets an idea of what&#39;s going to happen (&#39;I&#39;m meeting this person&#39;) and won&#39;t settle down until reality matches their plans.<br><br>(And for the record, it&#39;s the combination of dated slang &#39;yo&#39; with Budweiser advert &#39;wazzup&#39;.)<br><br><b>5. What do you want?</b><br><br>This person dooooesn&#39;t want to be here. This isn&#39;t their sort of event (though they are generally socially capable and do have events they <i>would</i> enjoy), and they have no inclination to pretend it is. I&#39;m inclined to say they&#39;ve been dragged there by a family member - not a friend or loved one (who they wouldn&#39;t want to upset), or a colleague or something (who they&#39;d want to keep in the good books of). Someone they are perfectly happy knowing they hate it.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I matched #1 to Ultima because Ultima really is infamous for its gratuitous poorly-written ye olde English.

But yeah, in a lot of RPGs, shopkeepers have no personality and their sole purpose in life is to ask what you want and then sell it to you. It made sense at the time...</p>

            <p>Heya Twisty! For fandoms, mainly Pokemon, Fire Emblem, and Percy Jackson. If I ever stop procrastinating I finish Miraculous Ladybug and Trollhunters so I an write for them too.<br><br>As for my agents so far... The first one doesn&#39;t quite have a personality so much as a space in the narrative he needs to fill: doesn&#39;t have an assibed partner (at the moment) despite being fairly experienced; very professional and distant, even when working with a temporary partner. Basically, he&#39;s got trust issues.<br><br>The second is more defined, since I&#39;ve got a backstory for her. The first thing I want to spork is an old fic of mine, and she&#39;s the Sue from that. Her backstory in the fic is (basically) Amnesia, so I&#39;ve got a few options on where to take her personality based on what I&#39;d originally planned for her character. Her main gimmick so far is Lightning. <i>Lots</i> of Lightning. Hijinks will ensue, and may or may not include intermitten explosions.</p>

            <p>Better than that--I&#39;d copied in the original post!<br><br>Turns out, the thread I was thinking of came about when Lily Winterwood went to Disneyland and came back with a question: <i>Your Agents (or Agents-to-be) suddenly have access to Disneyland (whatever iteration of Disneyland that you&#39;re most familiar with, at least).<br><br>What would happen?</i><br><br>Based on the responses and my own ideas, I wrote a chunk of an interlude (yes, some responses are in there: I did a <i>Supernatural</i> finale-style opening, since I was going to reference a bunch of the responses in the background). I didn&#39;t finish it, so it hasn&#39;t been posted, but...that&#39;s how things go, I guess. Given the timing, RL got rather busy around that point.<br><br>Speaking of timing: the date I have is June 23, 2013. The actual thread was probably at least ten days earlier (probably more.
