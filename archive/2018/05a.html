            <p>I applied for film school to study cinematography in London a few weeks ago. The admissions team said &quot;Cool, we like your application, and we&#39;d like you to come in for an interview but since you can&#39;t do that, finish a script and a storyboard for us, and send us examples of your past work and you&#39;re in.&quot;<br><br>I got my second round sent to the head of the film program last week, and today, I got the news: <i>I&#39;m in.</i><br><br>Term starts in September and I&#39;ll be staying there for three years—and hopefully making the move permanent once I graduate.<br><br>You know what this means, right? We&#39;ll have to have another Gathering sometime in the future!</p>

            <p>Remember the prompt Novastorme gave out back around when the Shipfest started? &quot;(At least) One of your characters is preparing for/on a date&quot;? Yeah, I wrote two lines for that at the time and then it got a while to cook before I finished it a week or so ago. Posting it anyway.<br><br>Feedback is welcome, including for <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=316057;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">the Reunions prompt piece</a> I did (which got buried a bit, I think. Too many wonderful prompt fills. Let&#39;s make even more! And more after that!)<br><br>Also, pretty much every prompt full I&#39;ve done is now officially canon (I don&#39;t know about this one yet, but I&#39;ll figure it out), and (again, apart from this one) has been given a doc, and a cleanup, and a title, and some nice formatting. I&#39;m slowly adding them to the Wiki, though so far they&#39;re not really on the agent pages (apart from Kozar&#39;s, IIRC).<br><br>At any rate, I give you: <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QoflvmBow4LQGC3EHawHE0rUXFyKjTdRUfzBskPiNqQ/edit?usp=drivesdk&amp;ouid=103109927077893819451">the date prompt!</a><a><br><br>~Z<br><br>--<br>PS: I put this together on mobile. Autocorrect decided that what I&#39;d <i>really</i> meant by href...was <i>beef</i>. A web link made of beef. Sounds a bit like something you&#39;d see on a mission...<br><br>PPS: That seems to provide the yellow highlighting of a link that isn&#39;t, you know, there. Pray excuse it for the sake of the anecdote (and possibly tell me what bit of coding would in fact stop it, if you want to; nothing I tried worked, and I&#39;m curious).</a></p>

He’d run the calculations, but if he forgot anything… well, that didn’t bear thinking about. Not now. <br><br>He checked the clock again. Seven minutes left. His figures were right. He was good to go. He just had to… what was that?<br><br>He stared in shock at the screen of his computer. “Damn program…” he swore under his breath. His heart raced. A crash, now… he restarted the program, fingers racing across the keyboard as he struggled to re-enter all the lost data. “Come on, come on…”<br><br>Three minutes left. Two minutes. One minute… Tom pressed the final button, letting out a whoop of sheer, exhausted joy. It was done. Over. He would be okay.<br><br>“Tom, what are you doing?”<br><br>Tom turned around. Al was poking his head through the doorway, his expression intense, and slightly irritated. Namely, the expression of someone who had just been roused from a wonderfully restful sleep by their incredibly loud flatmate.<br><br>“Oh, I was just… saving the world from a horrifying disaster, is all,” said Tom. “Y’know. The usual.”<br><br>“So… not what you just said, then.” Al looked over to Tom’s monitor and groaned, for he had seen the website’s logo, and now he knew what Tom had been doing. “Tom, Just do it ahead of time.”<br><br>“I always forget,” sighed Tom, huffing defensively. “The point is, it’s done. We’re all safe. For now, anyways…”<br><br>Al rolled his eyes, pulling his head out of the room. As he walked down the hall, Tom heard him muttering to himself: “The most dramatic I’ve ever heard someone get about their sodding tax returns.&quot;<br></p>

            <p>Normally I don&#39;t intend to break out the beta-reader hat for promptfic, but Thoth asked me to, so here we go! *cracks knuckles*<br><br>Paragraph 1, sentence 2: Tense agreement between clauses. I&#39;d make it &quot;but if he&#39;d forgotten anything&quot;.<br><br>P2: Here&#39;s a good example of short sentences increasing the sense of urgency! And this continues throughout the &quot;crisis,&quot; then stops. This is a good use of technique.<br><br>P6: I was very confused at this point on the first read-through. <i>Who the eff is Al?</i>, I thought. <i>Flatmate?</i>, I thought. <i>Oh, I get it, it&#39;s a prequel!</i> I mean, I figured he was doing some Laundry-related stuff from the get-go (or possibly a very involved computer game, though you did &quot;it was actually a game!&quot; already), but up until this point it could have been the PPC. {= )<br><br>P6,S2: Second comma unnecessary. Also, maybe &quot;Al had poked&quot;, if the action is complete by the time Tom looks.<br><br>P8: It was not entirely clear to me what Al is referring to by &quot;what you just said,&quot; but on the second reading, I guess it must be the &quot;saving the world&quot; thing? Which would not exactly be usual for Tom&#39;s desk job position? Maybe?<br><br>P8,S3: You&#39;ve either got a comma where there should be a period or a capital J where it should be lowercase.<br><br>P9,S1: Sighing and huffing is a bit redundant. I&#39;d probably just make the tag &quot;Tom huffed defensively.&quot;<br><br>P10: I lol&#39;d. Didn&#39;t see that coming at all. ^_^<br><br>What would I change: Maybe add a little physical detail about Al? Mussed [color] hair, or rumpled pajamas, or some little thing like that to bring him more to life.<br><br>What else did I like: Everything here has a reason to be here. No detail is wasted. The pacing is tight, the stakes feel high, and the punchline is suitably satisfying as a result.<br><br>Aaaand that&#39;s all I got! Basically, I liked it. Rite moar plz. {= )<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

From a distance, they could have been mistaken for twins, with identical long brown hair tied up in matching ribbons by request to their respective mothers.<br><br>&quot;<i>Stupefy!</i> You&#39;re dead!&quot; the girl in front yelled.<br><br>&quot;Nuh-uh!&quot; the girl chasing after her yelled back. &quot;You said that one only stuns people!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Well, now you&#39;re dead! So there!&quot; <br><br>&quot;Am not!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Are too!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Am not!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Caitlyn! Faolan!&quot; Mrs. Rosenberger appeared in her front door, drying her hands on a towel and giving the two girls a disapproving look. &quot;Come inside, you&#39;re causing a ruckus.&quot;<br><br>Caitlyn sighed and trudged back to her mother, but Faolan happily skipped after her, sticking her arm through her friend&#39;s.<br><br>&quot;Caitlyn, you know I told you to stop pretending magic was real,&quot; Mrs. Rosenberger said, putting a hand on her daughter&#39;s back and steering the girls inside. &quot;You&#39;ll give Fwai the wrong ideas.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yes, Mummy,&quot; Caitlyn said. She and Faolan shared an impish smile, and they giggled. &quot;Hey, wanna go play dolls?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Sure! Race you!&quot; With a rush of pounding footsteps, the two girls disappeared upstairs and slammed the door shut.<br><br>Mrs. Rosenberger shook her head. Hopefully, when Caitlyn went to Hogwarts and she and Faolan inevitably grew apart, the Muggle girl would just imagine her friend&#39;s stories were just childish games.<br><br>There was a loud <i>crack</i> in the kitchen and Mrs. Rosenberger hurried in to see her husband hanging up his traveling cloak. &quot;Faolan is over, so wands away,&quot; she warned. &quot;And you&#39;ll need to change into Muggle things so—&quot; She got a good look at his face, she felt her stomach drop. &quot;What happened?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Fenrir Greyback,&quot; Mr. Rosenberger said darkly. He was shaking, she realized, and she put her hands on his shoulders, hoping to steady him somehow. &quot;My team ran into him and some of his goons today. We took down two of them, but he escaped, and...&quot; He ran a hand over his haggard face. &quot;You know what he&#39;s like, Kelly...&quot;<br><br>Mrs. Rosenberger&#39;s hands flew to her mouth. &quot;Oh <i>no...</i>&quot;<br><br>&quot;I won&#39;t let it happen, I swear,&quot; her husband said. &quot;I&#39;ll be setting up wards as soon as I get changed.&quot; He gave her a gentle kiss and went to do just that. <br><br>At the top of the stairs, the two girls scrambled back into Caitlyn&#39;s bedroom and quietly closed the door. <br><br>They looked at each other.<br><br>&quot;Who&#39;s Fenrir Greyback?&quot; Faolan whispered.<br><br>Caitlyn just shrugged.<br><br><br>&quot;Fwai?&quot; <br><br>Ix looked up from her arms, startled. &quot;Hm?&quot;<br><br>&quot;You looked like you were zoning out there.&quot; Charlotte plunked herself down on the sofa next to Ix, swinging a foot idly. &quot;Thinking hard about something?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Oh, no,&quot; Ix said, tugging her jacket&#39;s sleeves down a little further to hide the scars on her wrists. &quot;Just dress measurements, that&#39;s all.&quot;</p>

            <p>Cheladoth screamed at them one more time over her drained wherry, then launched into the air. In a flurry of blue, brown, and bronze wings, they followed.<br><br>Skepnadth thrilled to the power of his wings. It had been too long since he’d flown, <i>really</i> flown, and he roared out his joy at regaining his supremacy in the sky. Each wingbeat sent a delicious rush of wind over his body, hot with the blood of the herdbeast he’d killed racing through his veins; hot with the southern sun on his glossy, dark bronze hide; hot with desire for his pretty green wingmate.<br><br>Usually the lambent shade of the sea after a storm, Cheladoth now gleamed enticingly jade as she darted away from her suitors. She was two Turns older, more experienced, and fast. In the time it had taken Skepnadth to get off the ground, she had already climbed over the treetops. The blues, only a little larger than she, were close behind, but she was too clever for them. When one got too near, she turned on a tailtip and changed course, weaving sinuously through the air like a dolphin through water. She, too, reveled in her prowess, and did not intend for her flight to be arrested so easily.<br><br>Skepnadth knew he could catch her. She was fast, but he was strong: he could outlast her and outstrip the lesser males in her train. His only real competition was the other bronze, Arnoth. He flew wingsecond, and not for nothing: he was smart, his conformation excellent with a bright, brassy hide, and he was brave and tireless in Threadfall. Skepnadth’s race was against him.<br><br>The two kept an eye on each other as they beat their way past the flagging blues and sought to gain the edge on the trio of browns who were still keeping up. Cheladoth was showing off now, pretending to fall back only to twist away and put on another burst of speed when one of them fell for it. Skepnadth saw that she couldn’t keep it up much longer, though, and he knew Arnoth knew it, too. Her color was less bright, her turns less sharp. It was just a matter of time before she’d have to choose or let the competition choose for her.<br><br>The young bronze wanted her to choose him. He’d show her he was the best dragon here—the best on Pern!<br><br>He filled his lungs to their limit and let out a great bugle that would have shaken leaves off the trees if they weren’t so high aloft. The others answered with startled challenges of their own. In that moment, just when everyone’s eyes were on him, he pumped his wings as hard as he could and shot out ahead of the pack. He was right below Cheladoth. She tilted her head down toward him with a flirtatious call, then climbed up, away. He followed.<br><br>Arnoth was right behind him, and gaining. Skepnadth cut across his path, blocking him, but losing momentum. The other bronze turned, almost as nimbly as a green, and the two spiraled around one another. Skepnadth couldn’t get past him; any way he turned, Arnoth turned, too, the perfect mirror. He hissed in frustration. Cheladoth had stooped down to loop them, taunting them with her nearness, and one of the browns was making a bid to catch up while the bronzes kept each other trapped.<br><br>Skepnadth couldn’t allow it. There would be one chance: one moment when Cheladoth was nearer to him than to Arnoth, and he could break away. He just had to see it coming.<br><br>It came! There she was, just beneath him. He folded his wings, dropped like a stone, and threw out his claws. Cheladoth squawked in surprise and tried to roll out of reach, but too slow: her claws rotated into range, and he snagged them in his own. Their necks twined together. Skepnadth opened his wings with a leathery snap, and together, they glided.<br><br><hr>
<br>When it was over, the two riders put their pants back on and sat side by side on the edge of the shelter’s bed, regaining their bearings. It was warm, since privacy wouldn’t allow for the wide open windows generally required in the South, but the wind had changed, and a welcome breeze off the ocean blew in through narrow slats below the roof.<br><br>“Are you sure you’re all right?” V’ranen asked. The dark-skinned Istan gently turned E’rik’s head toward him with two fingers beneath his chin and examined the shiny, white and red Threadscars on the right side of his face. “I tried to go easy on you, but you know how it is . . . ”<br><br>E’rik shrugged. “Well, you didn’t make it all better—but you could hardly make it worse.” He tried to smile without looking like he was leering. In fact, he’d lost sensation in that side of his face, and with it, mobility.<br><br>V’ranen looked dubious, so E’rik added, “We’ve been cleared for <i>between</i> flight for a sevenday. If I’m healed enough for that, I’m healed enough for this. And it was good timing. Skepnadth needed the boost to his confidence.”<br><br>V’ranen was kind enough not to comment on the blatant falsehood beyond a skeptical “Uh-huh.”<br><br>Of course, in the manner of dragonkind, Skepnadth barely remembered the accident anymore. It was his rider who suffered the worst of it, both physically and emotionally, and was still reeling from the blow to his self-assurance. After all, it was E’rik’s lapse in judgement that had resulted in them both being scored. After letting his dragon down so badly, it was he who needed to renew his faith in the strength of their bond. The exultant merging of their psyches in a successful mating flight had been just the antidote.<br><br>Currently, he felt Skepnadth’s replete satisfaction with himself as he curled more snugly around Cheladoth in the wallow outside. <i>I never doubted us,</i> he murmured sleepily.<br><br>In V’ranen’s weyr, E’rik chuckled. “Anyway, thanks,” he said, giving the greenrider a companionable clap on his bare shoulder. “I hope I wasn’t . . . you know . . . terrible to be with.”<br><br>“Oh, no worries. Anything for a wingmate in need, and Cheladoth likes Skepnadth.” V’ranen smiled, his teeth standing out brilliantly in his dark face. “In fact, if you find you have green fancies after all, feel free to seek me out again.”<br><br>“I don’t think you can use that expression anymore,” E’rik said, flattered and a little embarrassed. “More girls are Impressing greens all the time.”<br><br>V’ranen shrugged. “I’m sure the girls won’t turn you away, either. Seriously, if you’re worried about this . . . ” he touched the back of his fingers to E’rik’s scarred cheek, “don’t be. Anyone who can’t see past it isn’t worth it.”<br><br>E’rik hadn’t allowed himself to dwell much on his drastically altered appearance—he was lucky to be alive, and wallowing in depression wasn’t fair to Skepnadth—but he hadn’t completely accepted it, either. The other man’s reassurance buoyed his spirits, and he nodded.<br><br>“Thank you, V’ranen. For everything.”<br><br><hr>
<br>I don&#39;t have a proper title for this yet, but the subtitle is &quot;How Derik Got His Groove Back.&quot; The first time, anyway. {= )<br><br>I don&#39;t like using his original name, because doing dragonrider names that way is stupid and irritates me, but I didn&#39;t feel right changing it, either, so &quot;E&#39;rik&quot; it is. Sigh.<br><br>As he points out, I could easily have had a female greenrider in V&#39;ranen&#39;s place due to when this is set, but I preferred to show a healthy example of what happens when a straight guy ends up in this situation, because if you think about it, it obviously happens a lot. And it doesn&#39;t have to be OMG awkward and horrible for him if everyone understands about these things and nobody is judging anyone for it. So there.<br><br>I&#39;ve got another fill for this prompt in mind, so hopefully, with doctorlit&#39;s help, I&#39;ll get it up before the next one rolls around!<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Now, this here—this is how I <i>wish</i> the mating flights had been handled in the books.

            <p>&quot;The [player of the] female chooses&quot; is how we did things in Pern RPs on Neopets, back when I was heavily involved with that. OTOH, in <i>Dragonflight</i>, there&#39;s a wonderful line from R&#39;gul, IIRC, explaining to Lessa that the strongest male doesn&#39;t always win—sometimes it&#39;s whoever the Weyr most wants to win. And sometimes it&#39;s who the dragon&#39;s rider wants to win. Also, FYI, in <i>Dragonseye</i> a.k.a. <i>Red Star Rising</i>, there&#39;s a conversation between women greenriders about what happens if a blue whose rider is not at all interested in women catches their green, and the answer is that both parties can have their preferred partner standing by, so everyone wins. We fans of a more progressive mindset make the most of that sort of thing. {= )<br><br>But I also like the idea that dragonriders, when properly acclimated to Weyr life, just aren&#39;t generally as fussed about sexuality and the expression thereof as we are in our <s>woefully backward</s> society. Really, why should they be? Holders are because they have to worry about bloodlines and succession, and because the population has been decimated a couple times due to Thread and plague, so reproduction is considered a vital duty to keep the human population from dying out. Dragonriders, on the other hand, have to be more concerned with the draconic population, so they&#39;re exempt from obligations about breeding themselves. Plus, they have to fight Thread, so being pregnant all the time isn&#39;t really an option for lady dragonriders. They can have kids if they want to—werybred kids are always valued—but they can take a short ride <i>between</i> if they don&#39;t.<br><br>It&#39;s also worth bearing in mind that, the weird ideas of the author aside, everything is extremely effed up at the start of the Ninth Pass. Nobody is doing anything the way they were really intended.<br><br>... Oh look, I&#39;ve accidentally written an essay about Pern in response to a four-sentence post. You&#39;d think I was deeply immersed in this fandom for years or something. &gt;.&gt;<br><br>Ahem. Anyway. Trust me, the angst is deliberate. I&#39;m evil enough that the narrative irony of then vs. now makes writing these backstory pieces more fun. (And resurrecting some of my horde of Pern OCs is nice, too.)<br><br>And thanks!<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Cinnabar looked behind her briefly as the villagers scrambled away from their now-burning house. The Grimm inside of it weren&#39;t getting out to hurt anyone soon and in times like this, that was all that mattered. &quot;Evac 1, what&#39;s your status?&quot; Cinnabar called into her scroll, resting in a special indent in her left gauntlet, slightly battered from the physical and fire damage that the fight had caused, but working all the same. <br><br>&quot;This is Evac 1. We&#39;re full and moving out.&quot; The answer came as she saw the plane lifting up and flying back towards Shade and the safer parts of Vacuo. Moments later two more planes followed suit, their pilots identifying themselves as Evacs 3 and 6 respectively. <br><br>Cinnabar nodded as she strode along the street, Volcanic Storm in her hands as she moved to take a stand against the Grimm that were pouring in from the now thankfully deserted end of the village she was meant to be defending. Volcanic Storm roared as scorching flames leapt out of it, creating an immense wall that disintegrated the first few Beowolf&#39;s that tried to charge through it, leaving the rest of them at bay until they found a way through, or round. <br><br>In the background Cinnabar heard two more planes take off, although she didn&#39;t pay attention to what was being said through her scroll and her comm link as half a dozen Griffons flew over her flame barrier. Switching targets, she altered Volcanic Storm&#39;s mode, now firing balls of fire into the air at the flying Grimm. With no fuel to sustain it, the flame barrier dissipated, letting the land-based Grimm she had been holding off start to thunder towards her. <br><br>Retreating as fast as she could, she didn&#39;t need to look to know that the Grimm we getting closer. Swerving to her right, she leapt into one of the few houses that wasn&#39;t either destroyed or on fire. Racing up the stairs as she heard the Grimm smash through the walls and windows into the lower floor, Cinnabar managed to burn a hole through the ceiling of the second floor until she was able to haul herself up onto the roof. Lifting Volcanic Storm so that it was aimed straight up in the air, she fired three shots of fire straight up, watching as they exploded above her. At the signal the final Evac ship took off, as a smaller aircraft moved towards her position. <br><br>Battling on the roof top was not Cinnabar&#39;s preferred position, but she fought there all the same, Volcanic Storm lighting up Grimm after Grimm as they tried to fling themselves at the Huntress. Soon her own fire was supported by her team mates on their ship as it flew towards her, before a figure stepped out of the shadow created by a Ursa that was in mid leap up onto the roof itself. While the Ursa was surprised at the human appearing beneath it, the human calmly pulled out his weapons, stabbing the two daggers into the Ursa and watching it disintegrate as he moved towards Cinnabar. <br><br>&quot;Thanks Russ, you here to bring me home&quot; Cinnabar called out, as her partner moved to watch her back as the two of them made a stand on the rooftop.<br><br>&quot;Yep, couldn&#39;t have you dying on us Cinn&quot; Russ replied, as he stabbed at any Grimm that got too close. Without any warning he looked up, before taking a hold of Cinnabar&#39;s arm before using his semblance to shadow step off the rooftop as a Griffon tried to land on them, depositing them both safely in the hold of their own ship. <br><br>Cinn shook off the weird feeling of having been effectively teleported through space as the ship blasted off back towards Shade Academy, roasting a few Griffons in its wake. Sliding down the wall, she smiled as she looked at the rest of team COPR, they were bruised and tired, but they&#39;d raced against time and Grimm and had saved the villagers, even if the village itself was slowly going up in flames. As far as they were concerned, their mission was complete.</p>

            <p>You definitely deserve one, since you&#39;re running this whole show. {= )<br><br>I&#39;m slightly hampered here by not knowing the continuum, so I have no clear idea what the monsters (I assume) look like, or what sort of implement Volcanic Storm is, or why people can talk through rolled-up pieces of paper on their arms. {= ) You don&#39;t necessarily have to explain every little thing someone who knows the continuum could be expected to know, but a bit of description instead of or in addition to the proper nouns here and there wouldn&#39;t hurt.<br><br>I do more or less follow what&#39;s going on, so that&#39;s good. However, I think the action could be improved by means of shorter sentences and more active voice, to increase the sense that lots of urgent things are happening very quickly. For example, the fifth paragraph could be rewritten something like this:<br><br><i>Cinnabar retreated as fast as she could. She didn&#39;t need to look behind her to know the Grimm were getting closer. [Maybe a bit of description of how they sound or something.] At the first opportunity, she swerved to her right, leapt into one of the few houses that wasn&#39;t either destroyed or on fire, and slammed the door shut behind her. It wouldn&#39;t stop them, but it would buy her a few seconds. She raced up the stairs. As she reached the top, she heard the Grimm smash through the walls and windows below.</i><br><br>Et cetera. Stopping there because I&#39;m not sure she can really burn a hole in the ceiling and jump or climb through it faster than a bunch of monsters can climb stairs. Maybe she should torch the staircase behind her? Just a thought I had as I was typing this.<br><br>There are also commas missing at the end of the last two lines of dialogue.<br><br>With those improvements, I think you&#39;d have a solid little piece here. Rescue missions and a selfless defender holding out until the last second to save everybody is good stuff. ^_^<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Edward asked “So how do we decide who gets to listen to music today?”<br>Edward and Kat were always arguing over which music to listen to. They both liked musicals, but that was about as far as any similarities went: Edward preferred more classical ones, his favourite being The Sound of Music, and Kat loved anything Disney, particularly Aladdin. <br>“A race?” suggested Kat. “First one back to the RC wins?”<br>The agents had just left the SO’s office after having introduced their recruited badfic characters. There had been four or five of them, the Suethor of that badfic having clearly enjoyed creating OCs. <br>Edward nodded and said, “Okay. See you there!”<br>But Kat had already taken off.<br>There was no time to lose, so Edward hurried after her, wishing there was some water around. As he ran, he was pleased to note that he was focussed enough on running to not think about directions and so find the RC. <br>Kat, however, was a long way ahead and, although he was faster than she was, if he got close to her she’d just turn into a bird and outfly him. <br>As he followed the corridor through Headquarters, the gap gradually began to close until he was neck and neck with her. He also recognised where they were: nearly at the RC. Third door on the left, one more corridor and they were there. <br>Edward pushed open the door and Kat became a golden eagle. Edward’s advantage was that Kat had lost all her momentum in the transformation and he now had a slight lead over her. The RC door was in sight and Kat was closing rapidly. <br>But there were only three more strides until he was there…<br>He slammed his palm against the door triumphantly and said “I win!”<br>Kat was still a bird and waiting for him to open the door. He realised her clothes had been left behind in the transformation and decided seeing his twin sister naked was not an appealing prospect. <br>He opened the door and turned on the CD player. Kat flew to the bathroom where she always kept some clean clothes in case of a short-notice transformation.<br>Edward put his feet up, but of course, the Ironic Overpower being what it was…<br>[BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEP!]<br><br><br><br> Note: Edward and Kat are from the <i> Miss Peregrine&#39;s Home For Peculiar Children</i> continuum. Edward can control water and Kat is an ymbryne (pronounced imm-brinn) and can turn into a bird and manipulate time.<br></p>

            <p>I like the setup here. It&#39;s a simple difference of preferences, but it tells us just enough about them that they seem like distinct people with distinct personalities. It&#39;s also just enough of an excuse for two siblings to have a lighthearted little contest like this, and the way they handle it shows that while the relationship between them may be competitive, it&#39;s also friendly. For such a short piece, that&#39;s a lot of character development, and it&#39;s good stuff.<br><br>Structurally, it could use some work. First, when publishing online and not using indented first lines for new paragraphs, please double-space between paragraphs. This makes for much easier reading.<br><br>Second, I&#39;m a little confused about exactly what happens after &quot;He also recognised where they were: nearly at the RC.&quot; At first, I didn&#39;t realize the door he goes through there is not the RC door, though admittedly that&#39;s because I don&#39;t expect doors between hallways, so I read it wrong. I don&#39;t think there are usually doors between hallways in HQ, though...?<br><br>Later, Edward gets to the RC door apparently ahead of Kat, but Kat is &quot;still a bird and waiting for him to open the door&quot; as though she got there first. You say she can manipulate time, so what happened there? Did she cheat and get there first (in which case that needs to be acknowledged)? Or is it just misleading phrasing? {= )<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

It was a lot, though. hS, on Errantry since–she winced as muscles protested counting on her fingers–four years before either of them had arrived on the Board in the first place. Nesh, same. Kaitlyn, same. They&#39;d been wizarding since Julia was eleven. Even newbies had little &quot;on Errantry: three years&quot; tags in their signatures. Or five years. Or more.<br><br>Julia had been on the Board (okay, mostly off the board, lately,) for twelve years, and suddenly felt like the newest newbie to be seen.<br><br><i>It&#39;s a long story and my arm is still cramping, so I&#39;ll tell it briefly...</i><br><br>In retrospect, it made sense. Ix&#39;s ability to spin emotions into their stories. Scape&#39;s love of technicalities and way with bouncy prose. Tomash&#39;s easy fluency with code. All were experts in languages, beyond just the Speech. All were happily talking shop on the Board, hidden behind an &quot;(Errantry)&quot; tag and a very old spell woven into the Board&#39;s style code.<br><br>Suddenly, certain Gatherings and the very vague reports afterwards made a lot more sense.<br><br>Julia still didn&#39;t know who she was- two days of being Julia had made it more clear, but not by much. Julia still didn&#39;t know what she was doing- she had listened to the trees, she had listened to her local Advisory, and beyond that she still felt rather lost. Julia did, however, have friends she hadn&#39;t expected. And that counted for a lot.<br><br><i>-Delta Juliette<br>On Errantry, 2 days</i><br><br>----<br><br>(An itty bitty epilogue to <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=315434;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">Second Circles</a>, in case it wasn&#39;t obvious.)</p>

            <p>To be fair, I&#39;m not the most active wizard... I sorta struggle with that rejecting fear and embracing courage bit of the Oath. I&#39;ve always been more of an editor than a writer anyway, ever since kindergarten, when I got in trouble for pointing out another kid had a little plastic plane mixed in with their little plastic cars (or something like that) instead of just sorting my own vehicles.

            <p>http-equiv=&quot;X-Clacks-Overhead&quot; content=&quot;GNU Terry Pratchett&quot; /&gt;<br>I have no idea how I&#39;m allowed to see this. Someone must have mucked something up, or there&#39;s something going on that I don&#39;t understand or something.<br><br>Either way, it seems I really need to read Young Wizards. Which is why I&#39;ve got a copy of SYWTBAW on my floor right now. I&#39;m planning on reading it when I&#39;m done with Harper Hall and White Dragon. So... I&#39;d give it a week or two. Or more, I&#39;m exhausted right now.<br><br>Also, I sort of want this to be a thing (if only to feed the conspiracy). Actually, I kinda want to hack this into T-Board and make it a thing. The only problem is that it means that there will be threads that, theoretically, some members of the community may not be able to see every thread. This could Cause Problems.<br><br>OTOH, it would be REALLY COOL. So my suggestion is this: do it, then provide documentation on T-board&#39;s wiki entry, ensure admins can ALWAYS see errantry threads, and don&#39;t go to any great lengths to hide it or anything. Furthermore, I would add a chance that you&#39;d see errantry threads even if you didn&#39;t deliberately request to, ensuring that people can stumble on them, and further ensuring that it can&#39;t be used as some kind of exclusive Cool Kids Club. (Because sooner or later, it will be found).<br><br>And I don&#39;t want this to be an exclusive Cool Kids Club. I want it to be something fun. A little bit of magic in the board that people can stumble upon. A little bit of magic hidden in plain sight, so as to inspire a sense of wonder.<br><br>Even if this particular one can&#39;t work for the reasons above, if anyone else has suggestions for magic that we can sprinkle into things, I&#39;d be welcome to hear them. I like that sort of thing (I did add GNU Terry Pratchett to T-Board, after all. And also to this message).</p>

As a nice bonus, the script takes a while to run, so it&#39;s all visible... and then it vanishes. :D<br><br>(Not currently enabled for first posts, which are formatted differently to replies; I&#39;m not positive it&#39;s possible to vanish an entire thread based specifically on the subject of the first post, but with enough work it should be.)<br><br>I have no plans to bring this to the Board, obviously, but I figured it was a fun idea to play with.<br><br>hS</p>

It&#39;s... you know how the Manual talks about shorthand names? It&#39;s basically that, or your signature (for if you ever get a spell in the Manual named for you - not that I think any of us ever have!); other wizards can plug it into simple spells that you&#39;re a participant in but not enacting. You&#39;ll want to make your own for actual use, but... well, I enjoy Speech calligraphy.<br><br>(Anyone else, the offer&#39;s open for you too!

            <p>In the full name, absolutely, but the shorthand is... well, shorter! ;)<br><br>I&#39;m actually merging two concepts here: the short-form name (which in the specific case of <i>Wizard of Mars</i>, is able to be used for a passenger for an on-planet teleport), and the actual signature (the signature of the spell&#39;s creator is found in the Gibraltar Passthrough wizardry). &#39;Signet&#39; is my own coinage, and denotes a fairly stable loop (though, y&#39;know, Carmela still disclaims her favourite colour with &#39;this week&#39;) which can be plugged in to indicate &#39;there is a person in the circle whose name is not required in full&#39;.<br><br>hS, magical theorist</p>

Well, tried to read; he kept checking the console&#39;s clock every thirty seconds, anxiety building by the minute.<br><br>When a portal spun open, the Aviator nearly fell off the couch in excitement, tripping over his feet before jumping up and catching his daughter in a hug. &quot;Elanor!&quot; he cried. <br><br>&quot;Mummy!&quot; Elanor yelped when he picked her clean off the ground, swinging her around. &quot;I missed you!&quot;<br><br>The Aviator hugged her tight, burying his face in her hair. &quot;I missed you too, kiddo,&quot; he said, his voice thick.

I could make your favorite pasta—or—&quot;<br><br>&quot;Cookies!&quot; Elanor said, her eyes lighting up. &quot;Human cookies, with real chocolate!&quot;<br><br>The Aviator grinned and sloped towards the kitchen area, Elanor trotting at his heels. &quot;Cookies it is!&quot; he declared, and stage-whispered, &quot;I won&#39;t tell Uncle Zeb if you want to eat the raw dough.&quot;<br><br>&quot;You mean you don&#39;t want me to tell him if you do,&quot; Elanor said, laughing. <br><br>&quot;Well, yes, that too.&quot; The Aviator ruffled her hair. &quot;Why don&#39;t you get the eggs out and I&#39;ll get the mixer, and you can tell me all about how your finals went.&quot;</p>

            <p>&quot;I&#39;m going to count backwards from five, and then you&#39;ll fall asleep.&quot; Doctor Fitzgerald gave Ix&#39;s hand a gentle squeeze. &quot;Five... Four... Three—&quot;<br><br>She woke up, blinking groggily. Her entire chest hurt, and it felt like she&#39;d been punched in the sternum. She tried to suck in a deep breath and winced when she realized her breathing was restricted by the bandages wrapped around her.<br><br>&quot;Ch&#39;rl&#39;tte?&quot; she slurred, her head flopping to one side. &quot;Ch—Ch—Ch—&quot;<br><br>Small, soft hands caught hers and squeezed. &quot;I&#39;m here, hon,&quot; Charlotte said. Her bespeckled face swam into view and Ix blinked again, smiling.<br><br>&quot;Ch—Charlotte,&quot; she stuttered. &quot;Charlotte. Chaaaarlotte!&quot;<br><br>&quot;I&#39;m here,&quot; Charlotte repeated. &quot;I&#39;m here, Fwai. How are you feeling?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Chaaarlotte!&quot; Ix&#39;s hand tightened on Charlotte&#39;s and she pulled her closer. &quot;Did, did, did they, did they cut my boobs off?&quot;<br><br>Charlotte laughed and put her other hand on Ix&#39;s. &quot;Yes, hon, they did,&quot; she said. &quot;And no, you&#39;re not dreaming this time. You were out for an hour and a half—whoa!&quot; She put a hand on Ix&#39;s shoulder when she tried to sit upright. &quot;Hey, careful, take it easy there.&quot;<br><br>Ix slumped back against the pillows and closed her eyes.<br><br>She woke again several minutes later and looked around, feeling a little less out of sorts than before. She frowned, taking several breaths. Her head was starting to clear now as the remainder of the anesthesia wore off. &quot;Charlotte?&quot;<br><br>Her hand was caught again and squeezed, and Charlotte smiled down at her. &quot;You with me now?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I think so. Ow.&quot; Ix looked down at her chest, wrapped in bandages held in place by a compression vest. Her stomach rumbled and Charlotte laughed.<br><br>&quot;Hungry?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Starving,&quot; Ix said. She made to sit up again, brushing Charlotte off when she tried to keep her from doing so. &quot;I could eat an entire horse right now.&quot;<br><br>&quot;We&#39;ll get you food as soon as you&#39;re cleared to leave,&quot; Charlotte promised, gently cupping Ix&#39;s cheek. Ix leaned up to kiss her, and Charlotte bent down to close the distance so her fiancée wouldn&#39;t strain herself.<br><br>They broke apart and Ix smiled. &quot;Thank you for being here.&quot;<br><br>Charlotte scooted her chair closer so she could lean her head on Ix&#39;s shoulder. &quot;Wouldn&#39;t miss it for anything.&quot;<br><br><br>((It&#39;s not a reunion after a long separation, but waking up post-op can be pretty scary and it&#39;s a relief to see your family when you&#39;re waking up all delirious. Prompts were made to be bent, after all.))</p>

The dialogue in particular doesn&#39;t feel randomly distorted, but rather like a transcription.<br><br>Not much to nitpick here, and also I&#39;m on a bus and getting close to my destination, so I guess I&#39;ll leave it at this: the piece is solid and it was effective at making me feel Ix&#39;s wooziness and the comfort of loved ones, so I reckon that&#39;s good!<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I&#39;m planning on leaving her actually getting the surgery off-page since I don&#39;t really want to focus on the trans aspect of Ix&#39;s narrative; she mentioned wanting to get it done to Charlotte in their engagement interlude, and she&#39;s started on testosterone as of a few months ago. I&#39;ll mention she gets the surgery done, but like I said: I don&#39;t want to make this a huge focus to Ix&#39;s character, so it&#39;ll be a thing that happens and might slow her down on a mission or two, but nothing major besides that. (Unless you feel like it&#39;s really necessary?)<br><br>I stole Ix&#39;s dialogue from when I had surgery to remove tumors from my chest; her reaction upon waking up was basically exactly mine. Totally out of it, fell back asleep, woke up again with a clear head. I got very grabby with my mom (and apparently very demanding of food?) and most of what I wrote was told to me after the fact.<br><br>Thanks for the review. :)</p>

            <p>Kozar was standing in a field. It wasn&#39;t the Courtyard; if anything, he realized, it strongly resembled Bella and Edward&#39;s meadow, albeit with crumbling stone walls, upon one of which sat--<br><br>&quot;Ah,&quot; he said, and nodded. &quot;I am dreaming.&quot;<br><br>The Earther turned to look at him. She&#39;d been kicking one heel idly against the wall, looking out over mountains that belonged in Middle-earth; he&#39;d recognized her without seeing her face.<br><br>She smiled at him, one corner of her mouth pulling higher than the other. &quot;Hey, Kozar. No, wait--&quot; She frowned in concentration. &quot;<i>Qapla&#39;.</i> Did I say it right?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Your accent has not improved,&quot; Kozar said dryly. He walked over, standing at her shoulder. &quot;You also have the wrong word.&quot;<br><br>Her lip curled. &quot;You&#39;d think I&#39;d get it by now. What&#39;d I actually want?&quot;<br><br>&quot;<i>nuqneH.</i>&quot;<br><br>She repeated it, mangling the pronunciation. &quot;I hate languages.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I&#39;m aware.&quot; The mountains were snow-capped. He knew from experience that elven disguise was the best way to traverse them. &quot;Why do I dream of you, Allison? Have you grown restless in Sto-vo-kor?&quot;<br><br>She shrugged. &quot;Maybe you&#39;re just restless here. Or, hey--you miss me! That&#39;s not too much of an Earther thing for you, is it?&quot; The smile returned.<br><br>&quot;Allison.&quot;<br><br>She patted the wall beside her, more confident than she&#39;d ever been in life. &quot;Sit. Let&#39;s stare at some mountains together.&quot; She held his gaze when he stared, and smiled as he snorted. &quot;Come on, indulge a ghost.&quot;<br><br>&quot;A spirit,&quot; he corrected her, even as he sat. &quot;A remnant. A--&quot;<br><br>&quot;A memory.&quot;<br><br>He nodded.<br><br>&quot;Fine, then, indulge a memory,&quot; Allison said. She hesitated--she generally had--before leaning against his shoulder. &quot;I...kind of miss you, y&#39;know.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Do you?&quot;<br><br>She nodded. &quot;We only got, what, half a year together? I&#39;d been hoping for, y&#39;know, a longer partnership.&quot;<br><br>&quot;A longer life.&quot;<br><br>Another nod. &quot;Well, yeah. Who doesn&#39;t?&quot;<br><br>Kozar sighed, and nudged her shoulder with his. &quot;Klingons don&#39;t complain about dying in battle.&quot;<br><br>Allison made a face. &quot;I&#39;m human. I&#39;d rather have died in my bed, from old age.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I have noticed that Earthers enjoy complaining,&quot; Kozar said solemnly.<br><br>It made her laugh. &quot;It&#39;s an international sport! Someone really should&#39;ve gotten it into the Olympics by now.&quot;<br><br>Kozar grinned. &quot;You would leave with the gold.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Oh, come on.&quot; Allison rolled her eyes at him. &quot;I don&#39;t complain <i>that</i> much, Kozar.&quot;<br><br>Kozar sobered slowly. &quot;You did not.” He sighed and leaned forward, resting his elbows on his knees. Typically for a dream, he could feel only the stone he sat on and Allison at his side, and even that was muted. “I don’t understand. What reason could I have to dream of you now?”<br><br>Allison shrugged, tilting her head back to squint at the sky. “Dunno. It’s your dream, Kozar; I’m just the guest star.”<br><br>“Everything is normal,” Kozar said. “I lack nothing. Victoria’s Pov is in good health, my friends are well. Missions are still good enough at providing opportunity to do battle. Even my partner is tolerable. Why should I dream of you <i>now</i>?”<br><br>Allison shrugged again, and resumed kicking her heels against the wall. “Dunno. Maybe…”<br><br>“Maybe?” Kozar turned his head. It still surprised him, a little, that it didn’t hurt to see her. Early on, he’d barely been able to look at the few pictures he had of her (of them), much less manage to meet her eyes. He should have been by her side--but that was an old fact. To his private relief, it had ceased to feel like a crushing weight over a year prior.<br><br>Allison was still squinting at the sky. She suddenly seemed the slightest bit ethereal; it did not suit her in the slightest. “Maybe you want me to know you’re okay, or something. Restless memories, and stuff. I mean, we kind of had plans, didn’t we? We’ll be coming up on five years soon.”<br><br>A different weight settled onto his shoulders: regret. “You wanted to celebrate.”<br><br>“Uh-huh.” Allison nodded, and turned to meet his gaze. “Five years, Kozar. It’s pretty cool. Or, y’know, it would’ve been.” She shrugged. “I’m kind of used to disappointment, I guess. Though you <i>could</i> go do something anyway.”<br><br>“Alone.” It wasn’t quite a question. “The...my current partner has no place in this.”<br><br>“Or you could bring T’Zar,” Allison said. “You know, your friend? Who’s also an alien from your home canon, which is all kinds of odd with the different wars and stuff?”<br><br>“Perhaps,” Kozar allowed. The Vulcan had proven herself surprisingly good company for similar matters. “If I do this--you will return to your place in Sto-vo-kor?”<br><br>“Think I’m already kind of going,” Allison pointed out. She was right: her form was slowly fading away. “Besides, who says I’m there?”<br><br>“You are not in Gre’thor,” Kozar growled. Allison, among the souls of the dishonored? No. “I fought for your place in Sto-vo-kor. You—”<br><br>“Human,” Allison reminded him. “I could be anywhere, really. Or nowhere, I guess, but that’d be pretty boring. Let’s stick with Sto-vo-kor.” She continued to fade, until she was completely translucent.<br><br>Kozar stared at her, even as he felt the dream begin to fade as well. “<i>How</i> did you manage to mispronounce that?”<br><br>He woke up with Allison’s muted giggles in his ears.<br><br><br>--<br>((Klingon words from the internet, information on Sto-vo-kor and Gre&#39;thor from Memory Alpha&#39;s main article on Klingons.))</p>

            <p>There were only a few things Tom Andrews ever really took seriously. Programming was one of them: when you knew full-well that a screw-up could summon Cthulhu, it was hard not to. He claimed to take video games seriously, but there was a chance he was doing that ironically, in which case it didn’t count.<br><br>But he did take his canon studies seriously. Almost as seriously as Thoth did. And so in those rare times when their schedules aligned, the two partners might be found alongside one another, lost in books, only looking up to question one another. Thoth occasionally inquiring to Tom about “ancient” earth culture, and Tom asking for clarification on 40k minutiae.<br><br>As he was just about to.<br><br>“Thoth?”<br><br>“Hm?” The giant man looked up from his copy of <i>Dragonflight</i>. He had finally stopped wearing his armour casually (with some thanks to Tom, who had been required to assist in getting it off the first time), although the robe and sweatpants he had taken to instead were almost as odd. It didn’t make him meaningfully less intimidating to most, however. With that build, it was unlikely there was much that could.<br><br>People, however, could adjust to anything, and it was rare for Thoth to intimidate Tom anymore. “I was just reading through this stack, and I’ve noticed that there are a ton of different interpretations of what the Codex Astartes is. I assume you’ve read it, and I was wondering… which one is right?”<br><br>Thoth stared into the distance for a moment, thinking. Then slowly, deliberately, he spoke. “...Yes.”<br><br>“What.”<br><br>“Tom, what his the primary rule of 40k canon?”<br><br>“That everything is canon and that nothing is tr— oh.” Tom promptly smacked himself over the head with a copy of <i>Horus Rising</i>. “But wait. Then… what do you remember about it?” <br><br>Thoth once again took the time to choose his next words carefully. “I presume most 40k characters have a strong binding to a particular interpretation of certain events and objects—this holds true for myself with burning of Prospero, among others. But the Codex Astartes is not such an entity for me. I recall it as a tactical and logistical doctrine. At the same time, I have some sort of remnant recollections of it as some sort of Space Marine ‘bible’, an absurd text followed to the very letter by such chapters as the Ultramarines. As I am not strongly linked to it, it seems interpretation within canon is allowed to drift in my presence.”<br><br>“So what you’re saying is that you’ve actually experienced multiple variants of the Codex?” said Tom.<br><br>“That is what I surmise from the multiple memories I have of it, yes.”<br><br>“Wait. Then that means… you’ve lived in multiple alternate universes. You’re like some kind of Grand Unified Thoth! That’s AWESOME!”<br><br>Thoth sighed. “I do not believe that’s how it works—by my reckoning, my canon merely has been in flux around me—but I technically cannot refute it.”<br><br>Tom got up, grinning. “I’m gonna get the party streamers. How else can we celebrate this reunion of Thoths?”<br><br>~~<br><br>Yes, I&#39;m once again stretching the prompt to the breaking point to tell a story that the prompt gave me the idea for despite it arguably not fitting. :-P. I had fun with it, I hope you lot do too.</p>

            <p>I like literally everything about this piece... except that I don&#39;t think the interpretations you&#39;ve got of the Codex Astartes are actually in competition. ^<em>^;<br><br>On the one hand, with &quot;a tactical and logistical doctrine,&quot; you&#39;re talking about what the Codex <b>is</b>.<br><br>On the other hand, with &quot;some sort of Space Marine ‘bible’, an absurd text followed to the very letter,&quot; you&#39;re talking about how it&#39;s <b>viewed</b>, and that only by some.<br><br>Why not <s>Zoidberg</s> both?<br><br>There&#39;s always the interpretation of canon that says anything that doesn&#39;t make sense is propaganda, too. &quot;Oh, the Codex Astartes, it is so wonderful, oooh, &lt;a href=&quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The</a></em>Art<em>of</em>War&quot;&gt;Sun Tzu</a> eat your heart out!&quot; Yeah, totally not reviews submitted by friends of the author, no sirree. *wonk*<br><br>Anyway, to fix it, I think you probably have to look for variations on what the Codex actually is. How it&#39;s viewed and used is subjective; the contents shouldn&#39;t be. Discrepancies about that would be plotholes. I don&#39;t actually know all that much about it, though, so I don&#39;t have any specific suggestions. {= (<br><br>Or, perhaps, another example entirely. The timeline is FULL of plotholes. Like, remember I told you that, in one of the HH books, Magnus gatecrashes the Golden Throne <i>after</i> the Dropsite Massacre? Another book tried to explain that one: Magnus totally showed up on Terra two years before the Massacre, but the shielding around the Golden Throne and the Hollow Mountain and whatnot is so good that it took two years for the backlash to escape, so that&#39;s why Terra in general felt it two years later. (Rings about as true as the Liberty Bell, IMO.) But that&#39;s just the biggest thing I can think of offhand, because I&#39;m rather familiar with those events. I&#39;m sure there are others that would suit the purpose.<br><br>I am, of course, unduly tickled about Thoth reading <i>Dragonflight</i> on-screen. I look forward to writing conversations following this occurrence. ^_^<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I&#39;ll put that down to bad description, because I think the ideas of the Codex can&#39;t quite exist mutually—the Codex can&#39;t be both a timeless tactical doctrine and an overly-rigid guide to all the things you need to know. Depending on the author, the Codex is <i>The Art of War</i>, or it&#39;s <i>The Space Marine&#39;s Guide To Everything</i>. To be fair, the Codex has elements about logistical organization, but the Tactical Doctrine people will say that that&#39;s in the form of a toolkit, and the Rigid Guide people will say it&#39;s a precise specification. Or I could be wrong!<br><br>And yeah, the canon&#39;s full of stuff like that. So if I&#39;m wrong about the codex, there are plenty of opposing events I can find.<br><br>And yeah, of course Thoth&#39;s reading Dragonflight. Derik&#39;s been working hard: putting some effort into learning what he&#39;s teaching is the least Thoth can do.</p>

            <p>The point is, after all, that they inspire something. While it is fun to see different takes, a prompt fill that mainly used the prompt as a jumping off point can be great too.<br><br>This one had me laughing by the end. I also like how your characters are getting along; I mainly remember them from your Permission request still (I...do have your mission with Neshomeh open to read. It will get read. It hasn&#39;t yet, though, partly because I seem to have missed it when it first came out). Anyway: growth of partnership is always interesting to explore, both as a writer and as a reader.<br><br>My favorite lines (though I also enjoyed pretty much the entire last section, beginning right after Thoth&#39;s explanation) would have to be:<br><br><i>&quot;He claimed to take video games seriously, but there was a chance he was doing that ironically, in which case it didn’t count.&quot;</i> --fun line, right at the beginning. Something about it grabbed me.<br><br>&quot;Grand Unified Thoth&quot; --perfect. That&#39;s about where I started grinning.<br><br>And one bit of concrit: in the second paragraph, the final sentence (<i>&quot;Thoth occasionally inquiring to Tom about “ancient” earth culture, and Tom asking for clarification on 40k minutiae.&quot;</i>) is...a fragment, if I have the right term, and not the type that fiction, etc writers can use for effect. It ought to be rephrased or blended with the previous sentence--it could potentially be broken after &quot;lost in books.&quot; The new sentence could be something like &quot;They only looked up to question one another, Thoth occasionally inquiring...&quot; Or it could become two more sentences, like so: &quot;They only looked up to question one another. Thoth occasionally inquired...and Tom asked for...&quot; It could be played with even further, but by that point I think I&#39;d just be rephrasing it into my writing style, which is not the point.<br><br>...although, that does give me a thought for a different kind of writing exercise. People answer prompts, and then choose one that catches their eye to rewrite in their own style. Could be fascinating.<br><br>...anyway. Back to the actual review: this was a fun prompt fill to read. Nicely done! :)<br><br>~Z</p>

            <p>Yeah, that whole paragraph is really clunky, and looking back that is a blatant fragment... I fixed it up like so:<br><br><blockquote>
<br>But he did take his canon studies seriously. Almost as seriously as Thoth did. And so in those rare times when their schedules aligned, the two partners might be found alongside one another, lost in books. Over time, an informal rule had developed that speaking was only permitted should one of them have questions regarding their studies, typically Thoth inquiring to Tom about “ancient” earth culture, or Tom asking for clarification on 40k minutiae.<br><br>As Tom was just about to.<br>
</blockquote>
<br><br>I think that&#39;s a bit better. Hopefully it&#39;s not a run-on now, but I&#39;m pretty sure I managed to avoid that.<br><br>Anycase, I am really glad that you enjoyed it, because I was, of course, a bit worried about that (who wouldn&#39;t be?).<br><br>Oh, and do read the mission when you have time. I can&#39;t provide any unbiased perspective on it, but if you have half as much fun reading it as I did writing it then it should be good. Besides, it features Warsheep. Warsheep, Brotherhood, and silly dramatic entrances.</p>

            <p>While the vast majority of the replies are related to the PPC universe one way or another, you could also write something that is not connected to the PPC as well. Personally I&#39;d recommend keeping it to a canon well known enough for other people to recognise it for giving concrit, but you can do anything you want, so long as its inspired by the prompts. </p>

            <p>I do like the Star Wars movies, even the prequels to some degree. My point about the hype is that the reputation of Star Wars has grown so big that they can&#39;t live up to it. George Lucas&#39;s sf-western-kung-fu-wuxia-samurai-experiment-in-myth-making is not really the same as the Star Wars of modern legend. I think that&#39;s why the prequels aren&#39;t so well liked.</p>

            <p>On one hand they look awesome at first glance, and I sure think about them that way (Duel of Fates certainly didn&#39;t spoil anything). On the other, I saw some critics actually going through them in slow motion to analyze them... Results are people actually not trying to hit each other during the fight with their exagerated moves, leading to an excessively involved choregraphy, and not an actual fight. The LEGO video game is an undeniable strong point though.<br><br>(Fun (maybe) fact: the critic who made the video where I saw that said he would critic the prelogy without saying bad things about Jar Jar... And he actually ending up praising him as one of the only actors actually trying to play seriously their character.)</p>

            <p>...which was basically asking all my friends the following question:<br><br>Which is better, a lightsaber or a light spear? (For the latter, I was using the small, weird continuum of Lichtspeer for a reference, and not how a &quot;light spear&quot; would appear in the actual Star Wars continuum.)<br><br>It inspired some interesting debates among friends who were in close proximity to one another. They talked about different situations, combat advantages, the physics of lightsabers and other stuff, and it was overall a good time.<br><br>Definitely makes up for the fact that I forgot to wear any Star Wars merch.<br><br>-Twistey</p>

In 2013, the climax of <i>Thor: The Dark World</i> took place there, and that whole movie was <i>stuffed</i> with gravity problems. The massless, inertialess tanker early on was only the start of things!<br><br>More recently, the 2016 film <i>Now You See Me 2</i> tried to use a strobe light to generate the illusion of levitating water drops at the same location - only the distortion field instead <i>actually levitated</i> the drops! It was very clear that the same droplet was being seen in each flash of the strobe. (The uncontrolled environment rules out an ultra high-tech illusion, sadly.)<br><br>It is clear that a DOGA investigation is needed, probably with support from the Department of Analytical Science: this geographical anomaly has to be dealt with before it can affect the running of the Observatory, or somehow distort the Prime Meridian.<br><br><a href="http://bigthink.com/strange-maps/the-dustbin-of-geography">Oh, wait.</a><br><br><b>The Department of Misplaced Flora and Fauna</b><br><br>-<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubus_chamaemorus">Cloudberries</a> have been identified as an obvious transplant from a fictional world, likely a fantasy setting, and probably a game of some description. If the name didn&#39;t give them away, the fact that they are a vivid golden colour probably should. The fact that they are nearly impossible to cultivate, and thus can only be found growing wild on the misty mountaintops, is pretty much the icing on the cliche cake.<br><br>Over to you!<br><br>hS </p>

After walking for about half a mile, the path leads into a tunnel, made out of trees so heavily weighed that I have to put my head down a little so I don&#39;t hit it. This leads for a couple minutes, and then it just dives deep into the forest. One time, I was walking in a path in the forest, and I came to where I thought Civilization was. I ended up stopping before I hit the street, because I was blocked by a barbed wire fence. After some more walking around the edges, I learned I was in a sneaky government botany facility. Which I was very much not supposed to be in!<br><br>Obviously, someone engineer made a mistake with reality-bending trees.<br><br>(Also, on a bit of a spook factor note: At night, I hear children laughing and screaming from deep within the forest.

            <p>I used to go to a school that was some sort of hexagon on the inside of a triangle. It is rumored to have been designed by a prison architect. Every day, I would gather my supplies, walk down a hallway, suddenly arrive at a wing of the school I could have sworn was in the opposite direction, and after minutes of aimless meandering, I would wind up right back where I started. I ended up having to grab hold of a good friend&#39;s backpack, with whom I shared the next class, in order to navigate the place - either that or bury my nose in a map and hope for the best. <br><br>I am the first one to accuse myself of having no sense of direction, but even my navigationally-gifted friends were not able to consistently arrive in the place they intended to arrive until a year or more had passed. Department of Geographic Aberrations, please send someone to investigate.</p>

            <p>I think that this Sue assassination method should be restricted to God-Mode Sues and the absolute grossest Sues (i.e. Big Mac from Sweet Apple Massacre). Due to it&#39;s instant Toon-dissolving effect, Dip is only useful against animated and anime Sues.</p>

            <p>The Dip works by using a mixture of chemicals that dissolve ink, specifically Acetone, Turpentine, and Benzene, all of which can be used to strip paint. That&#39;s all well and good within its home verse because Toons are still make of ink. However, other animated characters are made of flesh and blood within their home verse, which PPC agents enter. Hence the Sue would be made of flesh and blood, and The Dip will have no effect. Of course, this is just my own interpretation.</p>

            <p>Coca-Cola gets its name from two ingredients it no longer contains: cocaine and kola nuts. It began as Pemberton&#39;s French Wine Coca, a wine fortified with cocaine, which was legal at the time. When prohibition came about John Pemberton created a new recipe which did not contain alcohol, and called it Coca-Cola. This version did still have cocaine, considered temperance advocates a safer alternative to alcohol. With the Harrison Narcotics Act of 1914, cocaine was removed from the Coca-Cola formula.<br><br>Vin Mariani, another brand of coca wine, was endorsed by such notables as Queen Victoria, Pope  Leo XIII, Pope Saint Pius X, Ulysses S.

            <p>A pangram is a sentence which contains every letter of the alphabet. The best-known one in English is of course <b>The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog</b>, but there are others, and many of them are <i>glorious</i>.<br><br>For instance, some time ago I ran into a perfect pangram (ie, a sentence containing every letter exactly once; Wikipedia charmingly uses the term &#39;an anagram of the alphabet&#39;):<br><br><b>Fjord-bank cwm glyphs vext quiz.</b><br><br>... or &#39;the runes in the valley beside the fjord irritated the professor&#39;. Assuming you accept &#39;cwm&#39; as an English word (it&#39;s Welsh originally), the archaic spelling of &#39;vexed&#39;, and the use of &#39;quiz&#39; to mean a professor, it&#39;s perfect!<br><br>Meanwhile, on the more intelligible side, Kaitlyn recently came across this marvel:<br><br><b>Sphinx of black quartz, judge my vow!</b><br><br>At only 29 letters, it only duplicates a, o, and u, and is of course amazing.<br><br>I would be remiss not to mention here the book <i>Ella Minnow Pea</i>, which is pretty much an exploration of &#39;what if pangrams got out of hand&#39;. I bought it for Kaitlyn a few years back and it&#39;s <i>hilarious</i>. ^_^<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>IIRC, regular chocolate uses Dutch-processed cocoa, whereas the chocolate in red velvet does not. Unless it&#39;s the other way around. But, one method results in cocoa that is lighter and more reddish than the other. This is then heightened with food coloring.<br><br>Whether or not this makes much of a difference to the flavor, I don&#39;t know.<br><br>~Neshomeh doesn&#39;t have time to look up the details right now, sorry.</p>

            <p>... Because the nature of the Lucky 10,000 is that you don&#39;t think it&#39;s noteworthy until you encounter someone who doesn&#39;t know it. Following the idea of the Lucky 10,000 will just lead to a thread full of common facts like how swords were mostly a sidearm and not a main weapon historically.<br><br>So, here&#39;s an uncommon fun fact in case people want to talk about those instead: Water doesn&#39;t conduct electricity. The stuff dissolved in water does; if you have a circuit to power a light bulb, cut one of the wires into two pieces, and dip both pieces in distilled water, the light bulb won&#39;t turn on. Try it with tap water and it will light up.</p>

            <p>Time period, location, role, wealth, culture, all kinds of stuff. If you&#39;re looking for the most common, though, you need look no further than the spear. They&#39;re cheap, simple, easy to make, easy to use, easy to train with, and they work especially well for groups in formation. With a long enough spear one soldier can help out the next three or four down the line. They were basically the standard for centuries and dozens of cultures, from the Greeks to the Japanese. At least for infantry, which is all I&#39;m really qualified to talk about. I believe Akrinor, Ekyl, and Maslab are more knowledgeable than I, but don&#39;t quote me on that. <br><br>Of course, as I mentioned, there are variations. A particularly notable example being the Romans. While they essentially copied the Greek Hoplite style of warfare in their early days, they later transitioned to shock infantry, charging into battle, throwing their pila, then stabbing with the gladius.<br><br>In general, though, the sword was more popular for self defense than warfare, somewhat akin to modern handguns.<br></p>

            <p>There are other people in the PPC who know a lot more about historical European martial arts than I do, so take this with a grain of salt...<br><br>From what I understand, polearms were the main weapon in a battle. They offer a lot of reach and power; a sword (especially a one-handed sword) just can&#39;t compete most of the time. There are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2YgGY_OBx8">a few</a> videos on YouTube of people going into more detail about this, and some  <a href="https://youtu.be/VHZKHmqa0KY">really cool</a> demonstrations by weapon enthusiasts  <a href="https://youtu.be/O8RWLxlzTiM">and instructors</a>.</p>

            <p>Main weapons changed based on how much money you had.  <br><br>Farmers were often pressed into service, and brought their farm implements to bear in battle.  It&#39;s easy to train someone who uses a pitchfork all day to use a spear or polearm.  They made up the bulk of the forces, so long handled weapons were very common.  They also worked great against mounted foes, so that&#39;s good.<br><br>The richer you were, the more metal could be incorporated into a weapon.  Swords were the mark of nobility because they could afford them.  However, these were people more likely to be on a horse during combat, so they used weapons more suited to mounted combat.  Flails and maces, both of which can best be described as a lot of metal on a stick, are great from horseback.  Just hold your arm out and dome some peasants as you ride by.  Try that with a sword (scimitars and other curved blades excepted) and you&#39;re likely to lose it on the first hit.<br><br>Swords were more used in settings like duels and tournaments, where the artistry of sword work could shine.  Little artistry to be found in the mud of an actual battlefield.<br><br>-Phobos, war hammer enthusiast</p>
