            <p>I think that the 256-multiverse theory is a good compromise between 2 multiverses and infinite multiverses previously mentioned. Canon divergence AUs and fics not marked as AU are located in the Prime Multiverse. The other types of AUs are their own respective multiverses.</p>

            <p>Oft have I studied the multiverse in which we dwell, and the other with which we have experience; indeed, I might say that it has become my life&#39;s work. <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uyY7ugbeCepIb_VirsCPh-OeWV8kNukM1YxxWilDLwg/edit#">Though many are the theories of the structure of reality</a>, I hold myself a confirmed advocate of <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vqToYQc_IkvEBti7lAWeS55mNR_aZzjoE7zXau85sio/pub">the Rose</a>.<br><br>That there are but twenty multiverses (or belike one and twenty, should the Tower of Reality be shown as truth) is proven by the mathematical beauty of the structure: how might one argue for more, when the locked triangles of the Rose show their perfect geometry? No, say I: in multiversal physics as in nature, simplicity and beauty are the surest indicators of truth.<br><br>((Norlossë is an in-universe character, and is not necessarily right. :) ~hS))</p>

            <p>. . . can eventually come up with ideas for more than 256 multiverses, yeah?  And since our scope is limited to what we can imagine, I&#39;m suspect there are far more than any countable number of them.

            <p>Since Tomash <i>did</i> just poke me about this... ^.^<br><br>So, for those who follow Diane Duane on tumblr, <a href="http://dduane.tumblr.com/post/175643466371/re-the-young-wizards-30-day-otp-challenge-some">there&#39;s news about the 30-day OTP Challenge!</a><br><br>For those not in the know: a few years back, DD started this canon-fic (not necessarily canon with the books, but very much a part of the YW &#39;verse) project and has been posting them to her tumblr for her fans to enjoy. Now, she&#39;s putting them all in an ebook - which means she&#39;ll have to take the tumblr sections down, due to Amazon&#39;s policies on hosting book content elsewhere. Fortunately for us, though, the ebook is free! Just follow the links. ;)<br><br>Also, we&#39;ll be getting even MORE of the OTP snippits in the oncoming months, so that&#39;s a treat!<br><br>(Feel free to use this post for other Young Wizards things, too. ^^)</p>

A Sofia that <i>acts</i> like Sofia (some of the time) but doesn&#39;t <i>sound</i> like her, an untitled book in the Secret Library, anachronistic (or at least World One!Earth-centric) references and geography, typos galore...<br><br>And most notably, an uncanonical kingdom (plus two Awesome McEvil villains) and amulet. The worst part? Check the author&#39;s note on the first chapter. Though really, it makes me worry for the writer, since revealing real-life information like that is one of the most dangerous things you can do on the Internet - or so I am told. ;)<br>I can only hope that book was written under a penname...</p>

It corrupts and twists the ENTIRE Pokémon franchise, nearly ALL of the enemies are character replacements, with Ghetsis probably being the only possessed one, Pikachu is replaced, the game mashes together the anime and the Black and White games heedlessly, resulting in MAJOR anachronisms, and Strawman!Not!Ash apparently gave away (or sold) one of his performers to Drunk!Not!Cheren, which just doesn&#39;t make sense. It&#39;s a game that sacrifices all forms of character development and logic to push a petty, stupid agenda about how a game about love and bonds somehow teaches kids to abuse animals. But hey, it&#39;s SATIRE, so they can twist the characters and replace and possess and corrupt them as much as they want because &quot;it&#39;s all for a good cause.&quot; <br><br>Whew.

The link is here: <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10250024/1/Sixth-Signer"><a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10250024/1/Sixth-Signer">https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10250024/1/Sixth-Signer</a></a><br><br>She&#39;s the Sixth Signer (That&#39;s basically the 5D&#39;s equivalent of a Tenth Walker), Yusei&#39;s younger sister (Let&#39;s charge ahead of time for Yusei having a younger sister in the first place: his parents died when he was just a baby in the meltdown that split New Domino City and the Satellite apart, and he survived because he was launched into Satellite in an emergency escape pod. His parents didn&#39;t survive to have another baby.), a very powerful psychic with weather powers (Psychics exist in this continuum, but this is obviously an excuse to make her more speshul), and she just jumps in halfway through 5D&#39;s without explanation (If she&#39;s Yusei&#39;s sister AND the sixth Signer, where was she during the whole Dark Signer fiasco?). A Mary Sue if I ever saw one.</p>

            <p>I don&#39;t know my 5D&#39;s, mainly because I don&#39;t know my Yu-Gi-Oh, but yeah, all of that reeks of Sue. That, and from skimming through the first chapter, I caught this little number:<br><br>   <i>Besides being a signer like himself, Ellie was also psychic like Akiza, <b>biggest difference being Ellie could control her powers... Somewhat.</b></i><br><br>So... yeah, that instantly rubs me the wrong way. We&#39;re saying that Ellie can control her psychic powers better than Akiza, who is <i>older</i> than her and thus would&#39;ve most likely been dealing with them <i>longer</i>. If that isn&#39;t powers for the sake of speshul, I don&#39;t know what counts.</p>

            <p>Already said my piece on it in the Lounge, but I&#39;ll say it again over here.<br><br>Over in the *Terraria* fandom (which luckily doesn&#39;t seem as prolific as some others, but that&#39;s no reason to let it go unprotected), I found <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8573488/1/The-Curruption">this</a> shining example of a badfic.<br><br>The fic in question is unfinished- only the first chapter exists, the writer having abandoned it back in 2012- but it already seems to be something that the Department of Technical Errors would have a field day with. The fic ignores the fact that paragraph breaks exist, generates a Mini with the title *alone*, cuts the benefit a player would get from a Life Crystal in half (you get 20 max HP from using one, not 10) while simultaneously misnaming it a &quot;crystal heart&quot; (which brings to mind a certain artifact from the My Little Pony continuum), forgets that the player character is supposed to start with a copper shortsword as well as the copper axe and copper pick.<br><br>On top of <i>that</i>, the fic also <i>severely</i> warps the character of the Guide, transforming him from a helpful, no-nonsense walking tutorial that helpfully directs you to sacrifice him in the name of progress once you near the end of pre-Hardmode, into a coward that goes flamethrower-crazy and then breaks down into a sniveling heap when called useless, and actually fears for his life just long enough to guilt-trip the Sue!Player into building a house for him to hide in... which he promptly abandons in favor of becoming a pseudo-player character, and tagging along with the Sue!Player while they go mining. (And even then, if the player character knew how to play Terraria, he shouldn&#39;t have needed guilt-tripping in order to want to build a house for the Guide, as well as several other houses for the various <i>other</i> NPCs in the game, most of which act as merchants.)<br><br>So, yeah, we&#39;re dealing with a Sue!Player *and* a possibly-character-replaced Guide.</p>

            <p>Hey, everyone! Thanks to the efforts of the Lost Tales team, including Hieronymus Graubart, Tomash, and Thoth, <a href="http://plotprotectors.tripod.com">PPC: The Lost Tales</a> has now been almost completely recoded in CSS and has a new appearance!<br><br>The only section we haven&#39;t touched yet is Anamia&#39;s Corner, because it&#39;s a big, tangled mess and looking at the current code makes my eyes water.<br><br>SIELU, the JAAKSONS, and the PPC Handbook are as close to their original appearances as I could get them. There is necessarily some slight variation. Where possible, all pages have a link to their original version on Wayback Machine or elsewhere, down in the footer. (This should be the case across the site, but may not be yet. There are a lot of links to track down.) Feel free to check it out if you want to compare. If you have any pointers, I&#39;d love to hear them.<br><br>Actually, any and all feedback would be greatly appreciated. Please tell me about broken links, things not displaying properly, typos, or anything else you notice. Even four people can&#39;t catch everything on a project this big.<br><br>~Neshomeh will get to Anamia&#39;s Corner this decade, she promises.</p>

            <p>Because I see no reason why the index.html and the actual story files for any new additions to LT can&#39;t have some autogenerated aspects. I mean, we can&#39;t entirely autogenerate all of them, but extracting stories from HTML files and putting them in the new format should be semi-viable, and automatically creating a skeleton index.html (just a list of stories) and maybe even next/previous links should reasonably simple.

            <h2>New Tales of Hieronymus</h2>

<p><br>Previously in this series: <a href="https://plort.wikia.com/wiki/Hieronymus#The_Stubborn_Knight"> The Stubborn Knight </a> (revised version).<br><br><h3>The Archivist’s New Apprentices</h3>
<br>Out of nowhere – or probably: elsewhere – Hieronymus the hermit, part-time knight and archivist’s apprentice, appeared in the courtyard of Castle Archive. He stayed there for a minute, marveling in the beauty of the place. Then he turned to the portal that led to a hallway, a flight of stairs and – beyond the stair, on the second floor – the corner where he used to store his staff and flask while he was at home. But he was stopped in his track, finding the portal locked and a message attached to the heavy wood:<br><br><p>Stairs and corners out of service due to renovation and refurnishing.<br>Please join us at Los Taelis.<br>We have a chamber prepared for you.</p>
<br>For once, the Kar&#39;eer Forest stayed out of the way and Hieronymus did not get lost again; he crossed the Turaipod Heights rather smoothly and arrived at the fonts of the Kattekri-tri in no time. Fort Los Taelis had been established through contributions from many knights of olden times, conglomerated in ways that did not help to make navigating the place easy. Headquarters appeared to be the obvious starting point, but Hieronymus had no idea how to proceed from there to find Baron Neshomeh or any hints at his new chamber. He did not need to worry; help was on the way.<br> <br>Out of nowhere – or probably, Genie space – the shape of a glowing red-gold fox appeared. &quot;Welcome back, Sir Hieronymus,&quot; the Djenni said, with the echo of a distant whisper that implied speaking for the Lady. &quot;We are currently rebuilding Los Taelis in a more consistent manner. The new magical signposts at Headquarters, based on a design proposed by Master Huinesoron, will help you find your way around.&quot;<br> <br>The hermit had already wondered why Los Taelis looked so different from what he remembered from his previous visits. It was still mostly made of brick-sized books, with an occasional scroll used as a sill or lintel, but gables and thresholds appeared to be more ornamented in ways that made the buildings, despite their different functions, look more similar. And the whole thing looked unfinished, and somewhat alive, with bricks moving around, scrolls unrolling and rerolling themselves, and ornaments appearing in unlikely places, only to suddenly dash off to where they actually belonged.<br> <br>While looking around, Hieronymus noticed a desk set amidst the central yard, covered in construction plans, sketches and scribbles. A nondescript figure sat on a stool at said desk, shrouded in magic.<br> <br>&quot;Did you meet Sir Thoth?&quot; asked the Djenni, the echo gone from her voice. &quot;He is in charge of everything that can be done automagical.&quot;<br> <br>Sir Thoth hunched forward, his fingers moving rapidly over diagrams and formulae, and another series of ornamented bricks were hurled about, some right through the flinching hermit’s chest.<br> <br>&quot;Don’t worry,&quot; the Djenni said, baring her teeth in what probably was meant to be a smile. &quot;Weaving his magic, Protector Tomash set up a multitude of parallel realities, so that you won’t get into each other’s way. In the end, all your achievements will be combined and moved to the <i>true</i> Los Taelis.&quot;<br> <br>Hieronymus was so used to weird stuff happening to him, he did not even bother to check for any holes in his body or his robes. But something else worried him. &quot;Protector Tomash? Sir Thoth? All the advanced magic and automation? Are you going to replace me?”<br> <br>&quot;Did you not hear us say ‘you’?&quot; The whispering echo returned to the Djenni’s voice as she spoke. &quot;There is still a lot of tedious manual work to do for our oldest apprentice.&quot;<br><br><hr>
<br>DISCLAIMER: The Djenni belongs to Neshomeh and is used here based on non-objection. Baron Neshomeh, Baron Huinesoron the historian (and, in the context of this tale, a master archivist like Neshomeh), Protector Tomash, Sir Thoth and Hieronymus the hermit belong to the respective boarders they represent.<br> <br>A/N: If Los Taelis had existed at the time, Hieronymus the hermit would have asked for a corner there rather than in Castle Arkive, so it was time to move. But since a Corner (Anamia’s) already exists at Los Taelis, he may deserve an accommodation upgrade.<br><br><hr>

            <p>I love the description of Los Taelis and things magically floating around and dashing off. Very Hogwarts. ^_^<br><br>The one thing that confuses me is the magical signposts based on a design proposed by Huinesoron. What does that refer to? And in this context, what&#39;s Headquarters? (This is potentially just me being dense.)<br><br>Baron Hieronymus definitely needs better accommodations for when he&#39;s staying at Los Taelis. A proper chamber, perhaps. With an office. A nice desk, plenty of quills and ink for all that tedious clerking. {= ) In fact... since I&#39;ve got a couple of wizards now, what would you say to being promoted to Head Cleric? Seems more fitting for your station.<br><br>~(Baron) Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Huinesoron mentioned it on the Board <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=309022;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">here</a>. Apparently my faulty memory told me that hS had answered to you when it was actually Zingenmir.<br><br>&quot;Headquarters&quot; is meant to be the organizational center (the main page with the sortable index). Since Los Taelis is a military establishment in-universe, I wrecked my brain for a military sounding word. In German, the obvious choice would be &quot;<i>Kommandantur</i>&quot;. The only translations my dictionary suggests are &quot;headquarters&quot; or &quot;commander’s office&quot;. I’m not happy with the former, but I dislike the latter more because it’s two words, I associate &quot;office&quot; with a room rather than a building and it implies the existence of a specific &quot;commander&quot; occupying that room (who would that be?). <br><br>Head Cleric? Head Clerk? Nah, too much honor. Although I’m a Baron now, I can’t tell Sir Thoth and Sir Tomash what to do (and in Real Life, I always preferred a staff position over a line position). Just being the oldest apprentice fits the hermit quite well for now.<br><br>HG</p>

        <div class="post-body">
            <p>I was one of the people working on Lost Tales, and I primarily did automatic conversions. I did these conversions using a tool called &quot;regular expressions,&quot; which I thought might interest some of the more technically minded among the boarders. Well, the technically-minded boarders who don&#39;t know what regular expressions are already. I get the feeling my audience will be vanishingly small... we&#39;ll see. Anyways, basically, regular expressions can be described as text search on crack. And also search and replace on crack. Sound interesting? read on. <br><br>Normal search functions allow you to search for a precise fragment of text. Maybe you can search out all the instances of &quot;Hello sweetie&quot; in a document. Maybe case-insensitive search if you&#39;re really fancy. Now look at this:<br><br><code>/ ... /</code><br><br>That, believe it or not, was a regular expression. They&#39;re typically surrounded by slashes when we write them out like this, for reasons which could take too long to explain. Anyways, a dot is regular expression for &quot;any character&quot;. So this will find any three characters (doesn&#39;t matter what they are: punctuation, letters, numbers, whitespace, whatever) surrounded by spaces. Cool, huh? No? It&#39;s basically useless? Okay, try this:<br><br><code>/[0-9]{3}-[0-9]{3}-[0-9]{4}/</code><br><br>This will find any standard-written, dash-separated phone number in a document. How does it work? Well, those brackets (&quot;[&quot; and &quot;]&quot;) signify a character group—that is, a list of characters where we want any of them. You can also specify ranges of characters. In this case, I specified the range 0-9. So any digit. The braces say we want a range {3,5} specifies we want between 3 and 5 of whatever came before it. In this case, I gave {3}, and what came before was a character group meaning digits. So we want three digits, then a dash, then three digits, then a dash, then four digits. Simple, no?<br><br>Actually, wanting digits is so common there&#39;s a neat shorthand: \d. So the previous can be re-written as:<br><br><code>/\d{3}-\d{3}-\d{4}/</code><br><br>Much simpler.<br><br>&quot;But Thoth!&quot; I hear you cry. &quot;What if I want to match a literal period? Or maybe I want a literal brace, or something?&quot; Fear not, my friends. Just stick a backslash in front of the character you want. So:<br><br><code>/.{\*/</code><br><br>Will search for &quot;.{*&quot; exactly. Right, here&#39;s a real regex I used (sed ERE, for those of you who already know what&#39;s up and are wondering) to lowercase all the HTML tags in Lost Tales. Okay, not the actual one, that one had a really nasty bug. This is a version without that bug:<br><br><code>s/&lt;(\/?)([A-Z]+)([^&gt;]*)&gt;/&lt;\1\L\2\E\3&gt;/g</code><br><br>Okay, that&#39;s terrifying. Let&#39;s take it apart. That &#39;s&#39; at the front isn&#39;t a regex thing, it just tells the tool I&#39;m using that I want to do a search and replace, or a &quot;substitution.&quot; The g at that back, likewise, tells the tool that I want to replace every piece of text that matches, not just the first. That forward slash in the middle separates what I&#39;m searching for with what I&#39;m replacing it with. When we take all that junk out, and just look at what I&#39;m searching for, we get this:<br><br><code>/&lt;(\/?)([A-Z]+)([^&gt;]*)&gt;/</code><br><br>Okay, that&#39;s <i>terrifying</i>. Let&#39;s break it down.<br><br><code>&lt;</code><br><br>This just says to find the literal character &lt;. That&#39;s it.<br><br><code>(\/?)</code><br><br>Okay, these parenthesis mark out a <i>capture group</i>. They&#39;re not literal parenthesis, they&#39;re just here to group together parts of the expression. Also, every capture group is assigned a number. This is capture group 1. Which will only matter much later.<br><br>Anyways, what&#39;s going on inside? Well, the backslash is a literal escape. So we&#39;re looking for the literal character &quot;/&quot;. And then there&#39;s a questionmark.<br><br>The questionmark means &quot;maybe&quot;. So, we&#39;re saying there might be a slash, or there might not be. If there is, put it in group 1. If not, just put emptiness in group one.<br><br><code>([A-Z]+)</code><br><br>Group 2. We have another range of characters. This time, it&#39;s all the capital letters. The plus means &quot;one or more&quot;. So we&#39;re looking for one or more capital letters, which we&#39;ll put in group two.<br><br><code>([^&gt;]*)</code><br><br>Group 3. Another character set. But there&#39;s a caret at the start! that means that we actually are looking for the <i>reverse</i>. So, this character set matches anything that is <i>not</i> a &quot;&gt;&quot;. And the star means &quot;zero or more.&quot; So, if there are any characters that aren&#39;t &quot;&gt;&quot;, stuff them in group three. If not, don&#39;t make a big deal about it.<br><br><code>&gt;</code><br><br>This is just a &quot;&gt;&quot;. It means that there&#39;s a &quot;&gt;&quot; here.<br><br>So if we put it all together, this regular expression first looks for a &quot;&quot; (those characters, or lack thereof, make up group three). Finally, it wants a &quot;&gt;&quot;.<br><br>Gee, I hope that makes sense. I&#39;m kinda bad at explaining things. Anyways, here&#39;s what we&#39;re replacing all that with:<br><br><code>&lt;\1\L\2\E\3&gt;</code><br><br>Let&#39;s break this down too.<br><br><code>&lt;</code><br><br>Okay, the first thing we&#39;re going to put in is a &quot;&lt;&quot;.<br><br><code>\1</code><br><br>So, what this means is &quot;whatever was in group one on what you matched.&quot; If you&#39;ll recall, that was either a forward slash or nothing.<br><br><code>\L\2\E</code><br><br>\L means &quot;turn anything between me and &#39;\E&#39; into lowercase.&quot; \2 is group 2, the uppercase letters.<br><br><code>\3</code><br><br>Just put down group 3. That is, recall, stuff between the uppercase letters and a &quot;&gt;&quot;<br><br><code>&gt;</code><br><br>Put down a &quot;&gt;&quot;.<br><br>So, if we put it all together, this:<br><br><code>s/&lt;(\/?)([A-Z]+)([^&gt;]*)&gt;/&lt;\1\L\2\E\3&gt;/g</code><br><br>Means, &quot;Find every piece of text that starts with a &#39;&lt;&#39;, which may or may not be followed by a slash (remember if it is), proceeds with a series of capital letters (remember them), and then whatever else (but remember what&#39;s there), followed by a &#39;&gt;&#39;, and replace it with a &#39;&lt;&#39;, and then a slash if there was one originally, and then that series of capital letters, but lowercase, then whatever came after, and then a &#39;&gt;&#39;&quot;<br><br>Phew, that&#39;s a mouthful. Aren&#39;t you glad you can just write that mess of punctuation instead?<br><br>Now, regular expressions (which work more or less as I described, consult your local text editor/tool documentation for variations) don&#39;t work everywhere. However, they do work in most programmer&#39;s text editors (If you don&#39;t use one of those already, then on Windows, I suggest notepad++, and on Mac I&#39;d endorse Atom). If you work with HTML or other plaintext all day, you owe it to yourself to learn them, and there are a lot of excellent online resources to help you do just that.<br><br>Hopefully helpful and/or informatively yours,<br>Thoth.</p>

My previous incarnation was Anonymouse, and before that, ThePoketrix, but it&#39;s been YEARS since I&#39;ve been on here, so long that I can&#39;t even find my old posts in the Search anymore... and I also go by yet another different name here on the Internet nowadays, hence the second name change), and was reading a mission involving the Fallout continuum, (specifically, <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wBn_WBmfK-WGjmzFDw8UUIxyCvyADzffwoYRKRVAnFE/edit?hl=en_US">Journey Down a Long Road, by ShatteredSanity,</a> covering the eponymous badfic by C.Stewart which... doesn&#39;t exactly exist anymore... when I noticed that the agents in the fic were incorrect in the charges they gave.<br><br>Specifically, the badfic mentions that the Sue had, quote, &quot;a silver .45 automatic pistol with a snakeskin handle.&quot; The agents seem to have erroneously mixed up the .45 Auto pistol (a weapon based on the Colt 1911, added by the DLC <i>Honest Hearts</i>) with the .44 Magnum revolver, judging from the line, &quot;Secondly, where did the Stu get a .44 , which are rare enough on their own, with a snakeskin handle?&quot;, which seem to have masked the actual charge here.<br><br>There <i>is</i> a .45 Auto pistol with a snakeskin handle in the game. It is the unique weapon <i>A Light Shining in Darkness</i>, owned by Joshua Graham (and, should the Courier complete <i>Honest Hearts</i>, owned by the Courier). However, <i>A Light Shining in Darkness</i> is <i>not</i> made of silver- it is made out of the same sort of metal that normal .45 Auto pistols are made of, which is presumably normal steel. (The <i>actual</i> special thing about <i>A Light Shining in Darkness</i>&#39;s appearance, besides the snakeskin grip, along with minute details like the skeletonized hammer and trigger, shorter barrel, trench sights, et cetera, is that it has a quote from the Bible- &quot;And the light shineth in darkness, and the darkness comprehended it not,&quot;- engraved in Greek on its sides.)<br><br>The charge shouldn&#39;t be simply &quot;Having a gun with a snakeskin handle,&quot; since that isn&#39;t a charge in the Fallout universe, because <i>A Light Shining in Darkness</i> exists. The charge<b><u>s</u></b> should be &quot;Having in your possession <i>A Light Shining in Darkness</i>, which is a unique weapon owned by Joshua Graham and/or the Courier. Transmuting the metal that <i>A Light Shining in Darkness</i> is made of from steel to silver.&quot;<br><br>In addition, another of the charges against him is &quot;Having a bullet-proof vest.&quot; While one of the traders at the 188 Trading Post does mention that the NCR used to give bulletproof vests to its soldiers, what makes <i>me</i> raise an eyebrow is that there <i>is</i> an instance of an actual, SWAT-style bulletproof vest existing in the game, that can be acquired by the courier. It exists as part of... wait for it... Joshua Graham&#39;s armor, obtained alongside <i>A Light Shining in Darkness</i>. So again, the charge should be &quot;Having in your possession a unique piece of armor. Tearing apart said unique piece of armor to wear only part of it,&quot; instead of merely &quot;Having a bullet-proof vest.&quot;<br><br>By the way, if it wasn&#39;t obvious by my paragraphs-long rant about how a badfic that was killed years ago actually deserved a few charges that are worse than what it actually got, I&#39;m a bit of a Fallout fan (enough to get very, very irked about how much people praise that one mod that adds holorifles to Fallout 4 for being lore-friendly. In the name of Arceus&#39;s well-lit tailpipe, <i>no</i>, it is <i>not</i> lore-friendly, the Holorifle is a unique weapon and all copies of it should either be in the Sierra Madre or in the possession of the Courier!). I&#39;m also really into Pokemon, MLP, Terraria, Harry Potter, and quite a few other things. Also, I&#39;m a bit of an RPer, so... yeah. Hello again.</p>

            <p>For the Pokemon-style exorcism (which uses a piece of canon as a Silph Scope to reveal where you&#39;re supposed to aim, and either smoke bombs or thrown Sue-Wraiths to knock out the Sue-Wraith), why are smoke bombs used?<br><br>I get the projectile Sue-Wraiths, they&#39;re explained as &quot;Ghost-type attacks&quot; and yeah, you&#39;re literally attacking a ghost with another ghost, but the smoke bombs are supposed to be... Dark-type? Except Smokescreen (the closest analogous move to a smoke bomb) is a <i>Normal</i>-type move, not a Dark-type move, and it&#39;s mainly associated with Fire- and Poison-type Pokemon. The only Dark-types who get Smokescreen as a move are the Greninja line (who get it because ninja) and Spiritomb (who only gets it through breeding).<br><br>I personally would suggest a silenced firearm (doesn&#39;t matter what type, although you probably want a pistol, not a rifle, for range concerns) instead- the Dark-type are known for sneaking, backstabbing, and striking from the shadows, and an unexpected silenced pistol round in the back of the wraith&#39;s head could be viewed as the move Sucker Punch (whose Japanese name translates to &quot;Surprise Attack&quot;). Alternatively, one could instead just capture the spirit when its back is turned without an opening shot, and charge the Wraith while it&#39;s in the jar- which again, could be considered such Dark-type moves as Thief, Sucker Punch, or Knock Off.<br><br>...Or, you know. Just have a Pokemon on your team with a Dark or Ghost type move.</p>

            <p><s>Nooo parentssss</s> no, sorry, that&#39;s something else.<br><br>Yeah, it&#39;s Dark-type. It&#39;s not a Dark-type <i>move</i>, it&#39;s just... darkness. And the ghosts are just ghosts. ^<em>^<br><br><i>However</i>, you&#39;re absolutely right that that&#39;s not really what &#39;Dark&#39; in Pokemon refers to; it apparently comes from the Japanese for &#39;evil&#39;, and it&#39;s basically Slytherin-type.<br><br>I&#39;m not sure what you&#39;d use as a physical embodiment of sneaky backstabbing.

            <p>So, say, in the Fallout Wasteland, you&#39;d slap them with a rolled-up checkered suit to draw upon the betrayal and backstabbery of Benny in <i>New Vegas.</i> (Or perhaps pistol-whip them with a 9mm pistol, because Benny&#39;s choice of weaponry is the unique 9mm pistol <i>Maria</i>, but that&#39;s a little more of a stretch and obviously involves actual weaponry.)<br><br>Or in Terraria, you&#39;d pelt them with rotten eggs or bonk them with a Clothier Voodoo Doll or Guide Voodoo Doll, all three of which allow the player character to kill their own NPC allies.

            <p>Gonna be honest, I *like* the idea of a Department of Inaccuracies. The PPC isn&#39;t infallible, after all.<br><br>Said department would especially help in cases like this, where the author of the mission is unreachable and has probably left the PPC completely, and thus wouldn&#39;t be able to edit their own mission.<br><br>If I do get Permission (or re-get, since I&#39;ve forgotten whether I&#39;d achieved Permission before I left- although I&#39;m pretty sure I hadn&#39;t) and the UDoI achieves canonicity, I&#39;d definitely join in with a UDoI team.

            <p>... you shouldn’t have a team dedicated to that. What would they do all the time? After all, we <i>try</i> to catch errors as soon as possible. Finding something only when the mission’s author is no longer around should be an exception.<br><br>I imagine that the Snowdrop wouldn’t have any agents permanently assigned to his department. He would temporarily draft knowledgeable agents from other departments as needed.

            <p>I have several agents who aren&#39;t permanently assigned to one department, or are Designated Experts. Agent Mortic is unpartnered in WhatThe specifically so he can be paired up with people who need expert help; Agent Huinesoron is the same for DOGA, plus he&#39;s Grelvish consultant for SIELU, plus he&#39;s in the Geology division of DAS. Heck, there&#39;s direct precedent over in the DCPS, where many of the caseworkers are also agents in other departments, and do DCPS work in their free time.<br><br>I like it; it&#39;s a way to get more variety in PPC stories without doing down the &#39;they&#39;re Floaters so they do everything&#39; (or &#39;they&#39;re Assassins but they do everything anyway&#39;) route.

            <p>The DIC precedent is apparently mostly mine, but I&#39;m pretty sure I was drawing on Despatch and TOS at least in part.<br><br>But it makes all kinds of sense. Not everybody can be an expert in everything, so sometimes a team of assassins may need assistance from a disentangler for a knotty crossover, or a Pyro for getting rid of troublesome non-canon locations. Sometimes the disentanglers might need an assassin or a Bad Slasher, because they&#39;re not in the DMS or DBS already for <i>reasons</i>. Sometimes you just need somebody who knows the canon better than you, regardless of department.<br><br>And sometimes the authors just need an excuse to put their characters together. ^_^<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>As for fandoms... I gave my fandoms at the end of the post, after the rant about charges, but I&#39;ll go ahead and restate them. (And also add a few I left out.)<br><br>Pokemon, My Little Pony, Fallout, Dungeons and Dragons, Harry Potter, and Terraria, among other things. (This time, sorted by magnitude of fan-ness, if that&#39;s a term.) Going to throw in Eternal Card Game and Magic: the Gathering, too, although I&#39;m not as well-versed in the latter.<br><br>Also, I prefer the Bethesda-era Fallouts, but purely because of the fact that I can&#39;t wrap my head very well around the Interplay games&#39; interfaces. (Especially the inventory screen, sweet Mew.) New Vegas is my favorite of the bunch, although admittedly I haven&#39;t gotten a chance to actually *play* Fallout 4 and won&#39;t be able to play 76 for a while, due to not having a strong enough PC and not owning any consoles.</p>

            <p>First off: hi, welcome back again; I remember both your previous names. ^<em>^<br><br>Right, those charges. The second one is actually addressed by the mission, which says this:<br><br><i>“ Where did he get one of those?” Sylvia asked, shocked. [...] will you please write down that charge. Bullet proof vests aren’t all that common in the Wasteland.”</i><br><br>So the charge is really &#39;having a rare bit of kit without justification&#39;. You can certainly argue that it&#39;s an inaccurate description, but it looks like the mission comes from the period when people felt they needed to list every single charge at the end, which means there was pressure to make them short and snappy.<br><br>As for the main charge you object to... yep, it looks like the agents were just plain wrong there. ^</em>^ It happens. Heck, Jay and Acacia once came very close to charging for not having Legolas leave Middle-earth right after the War of the Ring. Coming back to Sylvia and Natasha, they immediately after the discussion of the gun (which presumably has a snakeskin <i>grip</i>, rather than a complete snakeskin <i>handle</i>, which would be... floppy) act bewildered why anyone would use the skin of a dangerous animal to make a holster. Given the existence of crocodile-skin everything, that&#39;s a really weird objection to have.<br><br>It looks like Sylvia is from the <i>Fallout</i> continuum, so you can probably chalk it up to her making assumptions based on her knowledge of her world, rather than actually checking up on it.<br><br>I find it interesting that both &#39;special&#39; items come from the same character (he doesn&#39;t happen to have a Deathclaw skin holster, does he?). If I was doing this mission and knew enough about <i>Fallout</i>, I would probably summarise them all into a single charge: murdering Joshua Graham and nicking his stuff. ^_~<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Good point on the bulletproof vest, yeah. And as for the Deathclaw skin holster... one, yeah, even in FNV you can actually craft Gecko-skin-backed leather armor, where Geckoes in the Fallout continuum are indeed another type of dangerous animal. (Kinda cute, but dangerous enough to kill a man if they&#39;re not well-equipped enough, with how dangerous depending on the type.)<br><br>Two... yeah, no, Joshua Graham doesn&#39;t have a Deathclaw skin holster for his gun. ...Partially because, like most to all characters in Bethesda-era Fallout games, he straight-up doesn&#39;t use a holster for his gun, it&#39;s simply &quot;magnetized&quot; to his hip. Closest he has is a few black pistol-magazine pouches on his belt, and even then, it&#39;s definitely not Deathclaw skin. (I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s black leather or simply black woven cloth.) Still, I think the &quot;murdering Joshua Graham and nicking his stuff&quot; charge would indeed have been appropriate.</p>

            <p>And it&#39;s fine. The mission is years old and was found in the trash of the writer&#39;s Google Docs, so I doubt it&#39;s going to get fixed anyways, and it probably doesn&#39;t matter since the badfic in question was deleted, too. Just wanted to get it off my chest.<br><br>...Also, the mission didn&#39;t seem to have been proofread, either.

            <p>A book called &#39;Arms From the Sea&quot;.

He vandalizes a State icon, then swallows a poison pill that transports him not to death, but to a liminal realm—blue, aquatic, and wholly alien.<br><br>He’s rescued and shepherded by henchmen of the Polyp, god of the watery realm they call “heaven.” A series of encounters unfolds between Lyle and the monstrous, seductive god, who gradually reveals his grandeur and mysterious purpose.<br><br>Lyle is horrified at first but soon finds himself falling for the Polyp, and the potent and bizarre creative potential he represents . . .&quot;</i><br><br>A friend of mine over on the <i>Young Wizards</i> Slack, due to already having the book for free (since apparently the author was passing it out on college campuses?), went ahead and did a liveblog, which I&#39;ve transcribed (with permission) <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1U-aK8TMauveNt3ZuK7mVQeyINyk9XIuN_b2Sw9_xZ3A/edit?usp=sharing">in two</a> <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1S4j4WAdVmdCu8oZRC4xacQDtTdx5C1kvJ-4tSvMIT4Q/edit?usp=sharing">parts</a>.<br><br>Not Work Safe, Not <i>Brain</i> Safe.

            <p>I&#39;ve gotten through chapter 1 tonight. So far, it&#39;s mediocre, overly passive prose punctuated with moments of &quot;wait, what?&quot; when the author forgets to tell us something that would have helped things make sense. It&#39;s not a hillaribad laugh-riot like, say, <i>Eye of Argon</i>. But it IS only the first chapter. And the main character is clearly insane, and what he&#39;s experiencing might be partly or wholly the delusions of a diseased mind.

            <p>Or would be, if the white world Lyle starts from made any more sense than the blue world he envisions in his death throes.<br><br>The trouble is, the author doesn&#39;t understand people at all. When all our base needs are met, when we&#39;re secure and healthy, we don&#39;t lose all motivation and cease to do anything. We <i>create</i>. Heck, some people create even when they can&#39;t afford to feed themselves, because they can&#39;t help it. Creating and engaging each other in games, and dance, and song, and stories, and all arts and crafts, is a base human drive. You can&#39;t just ignore it.<br><br>I mean, sure, some folks will lose themselves in front of the TV or the computer, but that&#39;s the exception, not the rule. Most of us here on the ol&#39; Interwebz are using the medium for... you guessed it... creation. Sharing ideas. Communication and engagement.<br><br>It&#39;s not all positive, of course, but for the purposes of dismantling the logic behind the State of Salt, it doesn&#39;t matter. If every person on the planet had Internet access directly implanted in our brains, it wouldn&#39;t change the fundamental drive of humans to use their minds to DO stuff. Even dumb stuff. Even horrible stuff.<br><br><i>Brave New World</i> did the socialist-hedonist dystopia better.<br><br>Though, granted, it sounds like the dystopia in this book is just an excuse for weird tentacle-monster sex later. Point is, I utterly fail to care. The starting scenario makes no sense, and our protagonist cannot be sympathetic, because the situation he&#39;s raging against is unclear and baffles more than it horrifies. His escape from it has no power to move me.<br><br>I could almost get into it as a fascinating trip through the wild fancies of a deranged mind, though. Maybe he&#39;s a paranoid schizophrenic or something, the State of Salt is white because that&#39;s the color of clinic coats and padded walls, and that&#39;s the world he sees when he&#39;s taking his meds, and he&#39;s one of those people who convinces himself that he&#39;s not his &quot;real self&quot; when medicated and chooses the familiar delusion over facing up to stark, frightening reality with its confusing rules and expectations. I dunno. It makes more sense than taking the book at its word.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>But the odd thing about Salt is that (and I did skim this, so I may have missed something) to my recollection, the descriptions are equally muted and unreal there. And I guess that&#39;s the point, in your parse.<br><br>But if that was the mark the author was trying to hit, it would make far more sense to portray the scenario very differently. The ocean scenes would be comforting and muted, and Salt would be a more painful delusion than it was. As it stands... everything feels dull, and the ocean portions are tinged with Body Horror. With no contrast save that, it&#39;s hard to see why Lyle would ever prefer the ocean to Salt.</p>

            <p>It doesn&#39;t. But you get used to it and eventually learn to contain the internal voice constantly screaming deep within you.<br><br>My cat also says happy birthday. At least, that&#39;s what I assume he was doing, since he kept jumping on my keyboard as I wrote this.<br><br>Anyhow, have a very happy day! Have a potted aloe plant and an Ant-Man action figure as virtual birthday presents!</p>

He wrote <i>Throne Of Blood</i>, <i>Seven Samurai</i>, <i>Ikiru</i>, <i>Hidden Fortress</i>, <i>The Bad Sleep Well</i>, and <i>Rashomon</i>.<br><br>He died of pneumonia, and we lost a titan of Japanese cinema.</p>
