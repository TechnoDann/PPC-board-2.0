            <p>A Hero&#39;s Tale, or: Harry Potter and the Potions Accident<br><br>Harry Potter is a wizard. And also a wizard. And another wizard. And a few more wizards. And quite possibly a witch too. There were a lot of wizardly Harry Potters running around, is what I&#39;m getting at. If you think that&#39;s confusing, just imagine what Harry thought of it. <br><br>If your imagination is not quite up to snuff, I&#39;ll give you the gist of it. One Harry (Let&#39;s call him Harry Alpha) was wondering how on earth spilling a potion could have possibly led to a multiversal rift. He didn&#39;t think it was possible. He was right, sort of. It wasn&#39;t just the potion. <br><br>Another Harry, Harry-Beta, the Slytherin twin of Harry Gamma (Yes, they were both named Harry; Hagrid meant well but it&#39;s kinda hard to tell babies apart at the best of times, and when they&#39;re identical twins with the same distinguishing mark, it becomes downright impossible) was thinking that he was never listening to the Weasley twins again no matter what puppy-dog eyes Harry Gamma gave him; Gryffindor pranks might have been rarer than Slytherin pranks but they made up for it in imagination. <br><br>Harry-Delta was in the quite awkward position of being naked, and covering up the sensitive areas with a spare textbook. He was a consenting adult with a very good reason for being starkers, and that&#39;s all he would tell anyone, not that they&#39;d actually believe him. He generally tried to fade into the background, despite being taller than the rest and wearing a quite distinctive birthday suit.<br><br>Harry-Epsilon was looking at Professor Snape, his adoptive father, for guidance, but wasn&#39;t getting much from him; the version of Snape in this universe was somewhat shell-shocked at one of his worst nightmares come to life. Harry-Epsilon was probably going to be in for a rather rude shock if he talked to Snape before Dumbledore. No two worlds are exactly the same, and in the one Harry-Epsilon knew, a troubled man had learned to let go of hatred towards the dead. Harry-Epsilon had no idea of how rare this was. <br><br>Harry-Zeta was mostly surprised and emotional at seeing Hogwarts again; ever since an especially potent and troublesome magic had trapped him in the distant past, he&#39;d given up on returning to the place he had considered home. He would have been wrong about that, even if no strange convergence of magic had lead him and all his counterparts together, but that&#39;s a story for another time. <br><br>Harry-Eta was wondering why no one else in the room seemed to keep any artifacts on them aside from an unfamiliar sort of stick. His was a world where magic was in things and shaped by the wizard, rather than in the wizard and channeled through things. He would soon be learning that it was never that simple in any world. <br><br>Harry-Theta had trouble recognizing the others as him. This was no wonder, for they were land beings, as opposed to Harry-Theta and his kind, the denizens of the sunken isles. There is a story behind the many changes that lead to Harry-Theta and his fellow wizards becoming amphibious, but it doesn&#39;t really have much doing here. Here, it has already been averted.<br><br>Harry-Iota is just a new first year, and he&#39;s wondering if this was what wizards considered normal. A good look around the room would show him that it wasn&#39;t, but he&#39;d just been dumped into an alternate universe in the middle of a crowd of himself. He can be forgiven for missing some details. <br><br>These men, boys, and assorted other genders were all different people, from very different worlds. They had lived different lives, and had different stories to tell. But, as they would eventually figure out after the shock had worn off, they had things in common. <br><br>They all wished to protect their friends, and were all ready to defy authority when they thought it made a mistake. They were all brave in their own way- even Harry-Beta, sorted into Slytherin, would take great risks if the cause was right, he would just go about it in what he called &quot;the smart way&quot;. They all had a talent for getting into trouble. They all had a strong sense of family, and after some initial shenanigans, they extended that feeling to each other. And though none of them set out to be a hero, all couldn&#39;t see a problem without trying to fix it. <br><br>That&#39;s what really brought them together. They were, the lot of them, heroes to the core, and wherever they were and whoever they were with, they would fight the good fight. This time, they&#39;d do it together.<br><br>Voldemorts everywhere had better beware.<br></p>

I guess that&#39;s all I can say about myself right now.<br><br>So, I know this has been asked before, but what about you? How did you get here? Why did you decide to join? What are your fandoms? Et cetera. I&#39;d really like to know more about you.<br><br>And as for your newbie gift, my present to you is an early access ticket to the grand virtual opening of the theme park in the thread I&#39;m about to start. Stay tuned to watch it develop.<br><br>Well, I hope you have a wonderful time here! Welcome aBoard!<br><br>-Twistey</p>

            <p><a href="10b%3Fuser_id=16.html#ahriman">Jump to Ahriman</a><br><a href="10b%3Fuser_id=16.html#gilgamesh">Jump to Gilgamesh</a><br><br>No central theme this week, it&#39;s just that those are the two things I read.<br><br><a></a>When I say &quot;Ahriman,&quot; I refer to John French&#39;s Ahriman Trilogy, specifically the version contained within the <i>Ahriman: The Omnibus</i> volume, complete with sidestories, which follows the character in <i>Warhammer 40,000</i> that goes by the same name. It&#39;s not to be confused with any other Ahriman Trilogy (<a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AhrimanTrilogy">yes, as it turns out there is another one</a>), or any <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angra_Mainyu">other Ahriman</a>, although <i>that</i> Ahriman is the way the guy gets his name, because GW loves their historical references.<br><br>Anyways, this is a 40k tie-in series. And... not really one I&#39;d suggest to newcomers to either 40k or to the Thousand Sons, at least not off the bat. Go read some <i>Horus Heresy</i> (specifically, <i>A Thousand Sons</i>, one of the better books in the series and the canonical introduction to the titular legion), or maybe <i>Ciaphas Cain</i> for a better introduction to the setting. Oh, and definitely go watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLyiDf91_bTEgnBN0jAvzNbqzrlMGID5WA">If The Emperor Had a Text To Speech Device</a>, a hilarious fan-based parody that&#39;s become an ingrained part of the fandom at this point (sidenote: that playlist opens with the video &quot;An Intro to the Dark Millenium&quot;, which is unfortunate because the TTSVerse actually hasn&#39;t <i>reached</i> the Dark Millenium yet, so it just confuses things. Skip it!)<br><br>For those of you who are at least aware of 40k, but maybe not aware of the Thousand Sons, still probably go read <i>A Thousand Sons</i> if you intend to read this thing. Yeah, I know you could probably puzzle it out with the Wiki&#39;s help, but it really use useful to just read in that order.<br><br>Onwards from my suggestions on how to actually get into 40k and read this thing to my thoughts on it. Which are that I really really really really really like this series. This shouldn&#39;t really be a surprise to most people who have heard me talk 40k before: I&#39;ve raised these books more than a few times, and I&#39;ve gone on record saying that Ahriman is my favorite character in 40k. Were it up to me, these books would probably be some sort of required reading, at least for 40k fans.<br><br>Now, some of you may be aware that 40k has a bit of a split personality. On the one hand, &quot;grim dark future&quot;, on the other hand, one faction is literally a bunch of green football hooligan mushrooms who run on the power of being too stupid to realize that they&#39;re wrong (that&#39;s not an exaggeration). So depending on the writer, the 40k setting and cast can be the subject or horror, hot-blooded action, or dark comedy. Other genres, too, but it&#39;s usually one of those three. Ahriman definitely comes in on the darker side of the spectrum. This vision of 40k is vast, bleak, and oppressive. Which is... really appropriate, given the context and themes. Ahriman the character has always walked the line between anti-hero and outright villain, driven on an eternal quest that may not even be achievable by hope, dreams, and a gnawing guilt that may yet drive him mad. And sure, his goals are noble, but... do the ends really justify it?<br><br>And the smart thing about the series is that it leaves it up to you. In the very introduction, French say that&#39;s his intent, and I think it pulls it off well. If you want to believe that Ahriman is mad and delusional and arrogant and utterly beyond ever achieving anything, you can. If you want to see him as a genius, an anti-hero, a straight up villain corrupted by power... those are all valid interpretations of what&#39;s happening in the story. There are an awful lot of characters who believe any number of those things.<br><br>But yeah, this series is <i>dark</i>. Even in the first book, and it keeps going down. The quote in there that I still think sums it up the best is this: &quot;We are falling, and light is but a memory.&quot;<br><br><a></a>Man, this is getting kinda depressing. Let&#39;s lighten the mood by talking about an epic poem about the elevation of a hero though an endless parade of misery and despair... said no-one ever until now.<br><br>Yes, the other thing I read this week was <i>Gilgamesh</i>. Specifically, <i>Gilgamesh: A New English Version</i> by Stephen Mitchell, a version of the poem that I really can&#39;t recommend highly enough. It makes the poem accessible to the English reader without sacrificing the heart of the thing, and it&#39;s a heck of a lot easier on the eyes and brain than most other translations I&#39;ve looked up since. It does not, however, include the independent poem (that serves as... a sort of noncanon epilogue, I guess? It&#39;s a little weird...) on the 12th tablet, so you&#39;ll need to find another version for that if you really want to go read it (although I honestly don&#39;t think you&#39;re missing much).<br><br>This is also helped by the fact that, even unaided by a translation this strong, Gilgamesh is... really, <i>really</i> compelling. It opens with an introduction that just makes you <i>want</i> to keep reading, and that keeps going throughout. Part of that is the translation, Mitchell having done for Gilgamesh what Heaney did for Beowulf, but when I looked up more literal translations, I was surprised to what degree those same hooks were present. It&#39;s a good piece of literature.<br><br>Also, if you&#39;re used to hero mythology, Gilgamesh might not be what you expect. In some ways, it&#39;s Campbell to the absolute, with many steps in the journey of a hero present. But that view starts to break down in some ways, because, at least by my reading, Gilgamesh is not about a mighty hero going out and achieving something for their civilization. It&#39;s about a man who, while powerful, is ultimately <i>deeply unheroic</i> becoming the sort of hero who can ultimately go on to do those things. For you Fate fans out in the audience, it&#39;s the story of how Archer!Gilgamesh became Caster!Gilgamesh (some would argue otherwise regarding Archer&#39;s Origins. I say they&#39;re wrong. Fight me). It is about loss, and the fear of death, and coming to terms with the consequence of your actions. In that sense, it perhaps has more in common with a coming of age story than a traditional Hero&#39;s Journey. <br><br>Given, this is all my perspective, and I&#39;m not exactly well known for being right.<br><br>If you all have thoughts about any of these things, or questions about the disorganized mess of my ideas that I&#39;ve presented before you, please share them below. I really want there to be some actual discussion, and I <i>know</i> that there are other people on the board who&#39;ve read both these works and I&#39;m totally missing stuff.<br><br>-Thoth, signing off.</p>

            <p>I wasn&#39;t really interested in seeing this movie, since it isn&#39;t official MCU.  But my brother wanted to see it, and the Eminem song is pretty cool, so we went yesterday.  And hey, it was better than I expected.<br><br>Spoilers follow for the <i>Venom</i> film.<br><br>The impression I got from <i>Venom</i>&#39;s trailers was that it was going to be some nineties grim-dark preteen boy-aimed violence-fest, so I was pleased to discover it . . . wasn&#39;t.  There was humor in it, and while there was unavoidably violence, it wasn&#39;t as gory as I was expecting.  I enjoyed it for what it was; the creators were faced with writing a story with a character who&#39;s normally a villain in the role of protagonist, and they did a good job with that restriction.  (Interestingly, my brother had gotten the impression that it was a much better movie due to all the hype around it on the internet, and was actually disappointed by the final product.  Low expectations, heck yeah!)<br><br>I was amused by the fact there was a solid premise for a non-sci fi, non-comic book story right in the opening moments of the movie.  Looking past the shuttle crash and the alien organisms, I legitimately would have enjoyed a movie about Eddie Brock investigatively journalisming at Transhumanist!Elon Musk to uncover all the shady human testing elements of his business.  But then, I guess it wouldn&#39;t have been a comic book movie . . .<br><br>I was skeptical of how well it would work to cast Venom as a protagonist, but the writers managed it pretty well.  In the absence of a traditional hero like Spider-man, and  using an equally alien but much more single-minded creature of Venom&#39;s own species as the villain, Venom does indeed feel like a character I can root for in this situation, despite its monstrous qualities being dangerous in other situations.  They played up its lack of human thought and emotion in a comedic way to make it feel more ignorant of social norms, rather than outright malevolent.<br><br>I really liked the Scientist Lady with Glasses and Morals.  The fact that Venom even found the right host to be able to battle Riot later on is entirely thanks to her, so I&#39;m very disappointed that she was killed.  Even that has a silver lining, though, since her death wound up inadvertently taking out the blue symbiote, which probably would have allied itself with Riot and made it harder for Venom to stop the rocket.<br><br>Minor things I liked:<br>*Venom basically doing a &quot;web-shoot&quot; while escaping Elon Musk&#39;s private military.  Even though Spider-Man&#39;s not around, they had to homage Venom&#39;s origins!<br>*The moment during the final fight when Venom and Riot are fighting and draw away from Eddie and Elon, and the two humans have a <i>fistfight</i> in the middle of the roiling protoplasm.  It&#39;s silly as heck, don&#39;t get me wrong, but the fact the situation is pretty much unique to this plot lets me give that a pass, because we may never get a scene like that in any other movie, ever.<br>*For being nothing more than a teaser for a potential sequel, there was excellent casting and acting for Guy Who Becomes Carnage Eventually.  He was <i>very</i> eerie, even after saying he wanted to skip the serial killer stereotypes.  I also loved that he was writing in his own blood, to foreshadow the role it plays in his future as a supervillain.<br>*Probably the most fourth wall-breaking Stan Lee cameo of all!<br><br>Minor thing<s>s</s> I disliked:<br>*Both Venom and Riot see a lot of convenience in hopping from host to host, but of course, this is easily overlookable for the sake of letting the plot move forward.<br><br>Uh, bonus?<br><br>doctorlit reviews <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CdcCD5V-d8">&quot;Venom&quot;</a> by Eminem <b>(warning for NSFW words and the r-word learning-disabled slur in lyrics)</b><br><br>I don&#39;t know exactly how much creative control was wielded by Eminem himself vs. the movie creators.  The lyrics are a mix of Eminem autobiography and references to Eddie and the Venom symbiote.  At least the Venom properties are fairly established characters in pop culture, so the song&#39;s references to them won&#39;t feel aged once the movie fades into obscurity.<br><br>I found the music video quite amusing, with all the different people lip-syncing to Eminem lyrics—especially the little kid and the old man.  It&#39;s such a reversal of the sort of face that I usually see rapping, that it&#39;s quite trip to watch.<br><br>—doctorlit, a conflicted Eminem fan<br><br>♪I&#39;m the super spoiler Dad and Mom was losin&#39; their marbles to♪ ♪I&#39;m the super spoiler Dad and Mom was losin&#39; their marbles to♪ ♪I&#39;m the super spoiler Dad and Mom was losin&#39; their marbles to♪ ♪I&#39;m the super spoiler Dad and Mom was losin&#39; their marbles to♪</p>

            <p>Just tacking this onto another review post for efficiency’s sake.  Hope you don’t mind, Thoth!<br><br>(I read <i>The Epic of Gilgamesh</i> way back in high school, and I’m afraid I don’t remember enough of it to have any real opinions about it, other than, “it’s an amazing and lucky miracle that it survived long enough to be recorded in modern languages.”)<br><br><i>The Prodigal Sorcerer</i> is one of the <i>Magic: the Gathering</i> novels that were published by HarperPrism back in the mid-nineties, and generally aren’t acknowledged as canon any more, although technically anything that doesn’t contradict more modern setting details <i>is</i> still canon.  They’re out of print, so I’ve had to buy them off of Amazon, though I did get lucky back in college and find a copy of <i>The Cursed Land</i> at a traveling used book sale that came to Arizona State University’s campus.  That’s the only one I’ve read prior to this, and happily I found that not only was it a good story, but nothing in it contradicted modern <i>Magic</i>, allowing me to safely accept it into my headcanon as “definitely really happened.”<br><br>TPS was also a very enjoyable story.  Going into nineties fantasy, it was easy for me to expect both of them to be dated, with a focus on male protagonists, solving problems through violence, and other stereotypes characteristic of early nerd culture.  And both novels proved me wrong in excellent ways.  Both had a woman as the primary protagonist, and while war is present in both, and especially in TPS, it’s portrayed as the weakest option for fixing problems in both, and both have some degree of getting to know opponents, and working together with them to solve problems.  TPS doesn’t quite jive with modern canon as well, but it was mostly things that aren’t really the author’s fault, as the color pie wasn’t as defined back in those early days.<br><br>Spoilers follow from this point for <i>The Prodigal Sorcerer</i>.  There’s going to be one paragraph with some potentially uncomfortable subject matter, which I’ll warn for just before it arrives, in case the content isn’t your thing.  [I’ve actually wound up moving that to the very bottom below my signature, so it’s safe to read up to that point.]  The rest of this review should be G rated.<br><br>The most basic theme in TPS is of how racial prejudice can blind people to overlook actual dangers.  We don’t really know much of the overall world where TPS takes place, thanks to a magic Magewall that keeps the valley of narrative focus largely cut off from the rest of the plane.  Within the valley, barring a few members of races that aren’t focused on, are humans, elves (called Garans), and Viashino (<i>Magic</i>’s race of lizard-men).  The human leader Tagard wants to unite everyone in the valley, but the problem is that the Viashino have what seems to be the only fortified city within the magewall.  He unites the humans and Garan to attack it and take it over, and then creates a united council of human, Garan and Viashino to make democratic decisions —woops, he got assassinated.  And then his daughter Talli has to get over her prejudice towards the Viashino (Viashino had killed her mother years ago) to keep the uneasy three-way alliance together.  Naturally, not a single one of the characters ultimately revealed to be villainous in the end is Viashino, and most of the conflict is caused by other humans.  I liked that—that the protagonist was so focused on hating the lizard-folk who were so unlike her, that she overlooked the threat coming from the more similar species, and lost her father for it.  (I mean, I like the message behind it, not that bad things happened to her.)  Another more minor detail that I liked: a lot of fantasy fiction is written from a human perspective, so any character whose species isn’t described “defaults” to human.  But the narration in TPS is always aware that humans are by no means dominant.  It always explicitly names a human a human, and even human characters will refer to others as humans, rather than people.  Because they live in a world where not all the people are humans!<br><br>The viashino are a bit off-brand for the color pie.  They were mostly Red-mana creatures back in the early days, but with their fortified city of Berimish, their preserved cultural heritage, and their thriving, orderly markets, the viashino of this plane are pretty solidly White.  I do still <i>like</i> them; the details that they prefer climbing straight up walls rather than using stairs, and don’t know their own biological sexes until they mature to a certain point, make them feel more like a race of actual lizards that evolved sentience, rather than humans who got a scaly visual overlay.  They just . . . don’t quite match modern viashino in <i>Magic</i>.  Although within the context of the novel, it does at least keep consistency with respect to enemy color pairs, as the human culture is pretty clearly red here.  They live in caves, are easily driven to anger, and have close bonds to their immediate communities.  So at least the Red vs. White conflict is properly present.<br><br>The Garan elves are also a little iffy to me.  Abhorring constructed weaponry is certainly Green, but the reason the Garans forbid weapons feels more Red.  Basically, they had such violent wars against each other in the past that they nearly wiped themselves out, and learned carefully controlled hand-to-hand combat in order to force some control and caution over combat.  First of all, I recognize this as being ripped off of Vulcans, even as a non-Trekker.  But secondly, yeah.  Having such uncontrolled emotions is blatantly red in M;tG, even at the start, so it feels weird.  Still, it is a creative new take on why a given culture of elves forgoes metal weaponry.<br><br>But for an absolute home run with the color pie, we have the humans of Suderbod, in their swamp-based kingdom just outside the Magewall.  I love that Sumner actually worked the geography of swamps as M:tG’s source of Black mana into the culture of the humans who live there.  Living in a low, dirty land means there’s a heavy cultural focus of cleanliness, with the need for public communal baths beating out public propriety against nudity as a cultural norm, and the fact that those with higher social status are more able/compelled to wash frequently.  The clothes and even armor of the Suder sport garish bright colors in contrasting geometric patterns, which would show off any physical muck more clearly, giving the wearers an even greater incentive to keep clean.  The best part is (and I didn’t even realize until I happened to notice a copy of the Prodigal Sorcerer card on the back of the novel) that those color schemes were inspired directly by the older art on that card; even the floppy hat and forked beard were incorporated into the fashions of the Suder.  It’s ultimately a minor detail, but it’s still rather cool that Sumner took every detail he could from the one card (I know of) that inspired the novel.<br><br>So ultimately, considering this novel’s age, it’s still decently in-line with modern M:tG, and isn’t much a blend of stereotypes from outdated nerd culture.  Pretty nice!  I’m looking forward to reading more of these out-of-print M:tG novels, and making posts about them, even though I’m almost certainly the only one here who’s bothered to track them down and no one will have anything to add.<br><br>Hm.  I think I’ll just push that one unpleasant paragraph off to after my usual outro stuff, so folks can skip it if they don’t want to read it.  It’s going to be discussing non-graphically the leader of Suderbod intending to molest a teenage elf male and a teenage human female.  There’s nothing else of real value from this point, so stop reading and don’t scroll further if that’s not for you.<br><br>—doctorlit, about to go on an epic wiki walk about M:tG after not really paying much attention to it for years<br><br>“Some Viashino think spoilers are nice to look at, that’s all.” “Some Viashino think spoilers are nice to look at, that’s all.” “Some Viashino think spoilers are nice to look at, that’s all.” “Some Viashino think spoilers are nice to look at, that’s all.” <br><br>Okay, the unpleasantness begins here: yeah, the leader of Suderbod, I forget . . . Solin, that’s the name.  Apparently he’s way into bedroom stuff, and went after two of the main characters, mainly because of the boy—he had never been with a Garan before.  I don’t feel it really added anything to the narrative.  It’s mostly there so Solin’s one underling can leave him alone with the wizard girl so she could kill Solin and let the underling take the throne.  But it could have been, you know, a dinner party to hear Garan fairy tales, or whatever.  The only reason I even bring the scene up, and the only detail that somewhat vindicates its presence, is that it kind of reverses the gender expectations of the setup: Solin goes after the boy first, and the girl is the one who saves him by saying “take me instead” and then magicking Solin to death.  That at least makes for a nice finale to the scene, but again, it would have been nicer for the novel not to contain that scene to begin with.</p>

            <p>I haven&#39;t read the particular translation you mention, but I own a different version, so here: talking!<br><br>The Epic of Gilgamesh is, to a modern reader, a deeply weird story, but it has resonances. If you&#39;re Judeo-Christian: remember how Genesis randomly includes stories like that of Onan (who was killed by God for doing sex wrong), or how Lamech just wanders up to his family and says, &quot;You know how Cain was a murderer and God hated him? Yeah, I&#39;m like that, only <i>much worse</i>&quot;, or how there are <i>multiple</i> scenes where some ostensibly sympathetic character gets blind drunk and people do stuff to them while they sleep (Noah and Lot spring to mind)? Or if you&#39;re not Christian: you know how Greek mythology has this endless litany of &#39;and then Zeus turned into a <i>different</i> animal which some girl happened to be really into and/or maybe it was rape, who knows&#39;?<br><br>Yeah, Gilgamesh is like that. One of the opening scenes has the gods deciding that Gilgamesh needs a best bud to fight (so he&#39;ll stop ignoring his job), so they create a super hairy man named Enkidu. But, problem! Enkidu is quite happy to just chill out in the countryside, hanging with his wild animal besties.<br><br>Solution: a hunter who ran into Enkidu asks Gilgamesh if he can borrow a prostitute, then takes her and has her get naked to lure Enkidu away from the animals. After <i>a literal week of constant boinking</i>, Enkidu agrees to go over to Uruk and meet this Gilgamesh bloke. And Gilly and Enki fight, and then they kiss and make up, and then they go off to fight some monsters for kicks.<br><br>None of this is hyperbole or subtext; it&#39;s all right there on the tablets. It&#39;s <i>all</i> like that. Seriously. (Oh, and the prostitute is named &#39;Sham-hat&#39;, because history is awesome.)<br><br>The thing about <i>Gilgamesh</i> it&#39;s that it&#39;s a lot less refined than the Greek myths (or the Biblical ones). Homer, Hesiod, or Moses have a textual tradition behind them: they&#39;ve been continually recorded, translated, and altered for thousands of years. <i>Gilgamesh</i>, in contrast, is known from original, 4000-year-old clay tablets. It&#39;s a record of a sprawling oral tradition <i>at the time it was current</i>. It&#39;s fireside stories told by a bunch of different people, all crammed together into an only crudely-joined narrative.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>It is all of those things. As Mitchell notes (and this is fascinating, which is why I&#39;m borrowing it), sex in this mythology isn&#39;t an act of savagery, or something sinister. Sex is <i>noble</i>, and a <i>civilizing act</i>.<br><br>It&#39;s also notable that that prostitute isn&#39;t really a prostitute: she&#39;s a priestess. Sexuality isn&#39;t just civilizing, it&#39;s actually <i>holy</i>.<br><br>And yeah, Gilgamesh is definitely less refined. The version I read was primarily based on the &quot;standard version&quot; which was a later Akkadian version. The earlier Babylonian versions are actually separate stories, and have their own mix of information that&#39;s a little different: namely, they&#39;re a lot more independent, being a chronicle of several stories rather than a single epic.<br><br>In that respect, they&#39;re comparable to the XIIth tablet of the standard version, which tells an entirely different story and actively contradicts the rest of the epic (Enkidu dies in a totally different way), and is primarily used as a device to explain the grim details of the underworld to the reader or listener.</p>

            <p>Yeah, that&#39;s not an inaccurate summary.<br><br>Also, it&#39;s interesting to note the differences between Enkidu and Gilgamesh.

            <p>Well, I just got back from a weekend at Universal Studios in Orlando, and it&#39;s definitely given me a fun idea!<br><br>So... imagine that somehow, we have the rights and the resources to build a theme park themed around the PPC universe. What would we put in it, in terms of rides, shops and dining, shows, other attractions, and events?<br><br>Currently, I have a ride idea that I&#39;ve grown rather fond of. It would function rather similar to the Universal ride &quot;Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey&quot;, with the riders being moved about on seats attached to the ends of hiddden robotic arms and with much of the needed graphics being a projection that creates the illusion of motion. &quot;Plot&quot; wise, it&#39;s based on my recent plan for a self-insert agent in the DoSAT, who mainly prototypes new PPC devices and some personal passion projects, with the premise of the ride being that you have volunteered to test a flying machine she has created. I&#39;m currently working out the plot from there. Also like the Harry Potter ride it&#39;s inspired by, some degree of exposition is given by projections of characters while the riders wait in line.<br><br>Alright, that&#39;s my idea, now what flights of fancy do you guys have to offer?<br><br>-Twistey</p>

            <p>I think a &quot;Multiversal Tour&quot; ride would be pretty cool.  Either as a slowish dark ride, or an outdoor tram ride.  And it takes the riders through a series of physical sets built to represent locations and scenes from the PPC&#39;s main canons.  Say, just as example, maybe Aglarond, a TARDIS interior (possibly flying around during a battle in the Time War?), the Department of Mysteries, [an obligatory something to represent anime/manga/Ghibli films, I don&#39;t really follow the genre well enough to say], an off-shore kraken attack on the <i>Black Pearl</i>, something out of Shakespeare (a simple speech, perhaps?), the midst of a firefight out of <i>Halo</i>.  The exact contents might vary depending on whether it&#39;s an indoor or outdoor ride, but I do want it as actual sets, not just video on a screen.<br><br>Also, never mind the <i>food</i> shops, let&#39;s talk merchandising!  We&#39;ve got to rip off Disney&#39;s pin trading thing.  We can have department and division flashpatches, chibi agents, all the minis, OFU crests . . .<br><br>Oh, and how about a poster shop themed around Bjam?  It could have the sorts of banners she makes in canon, plus classy-looking posters of OFU crests and flashpatches, and maybe group portraits of some of the smaller departments&#39; and divisions&#39; staffs, or group portraits of characters by individual authors.<br><br>Oh, and around Halloween, we can do scary mazes!  Except play it completely straight: no blood or anything, all the Mary Sues in the maze are portrayed as glittery and bright and friendly, and it&#39;s just the behavior of the cast members playing the mind-controlled canons that makes it unsettling . . .<br><br>I had more thoughts about this than I realized before I started typing!  I&#39;ll keep thinking over it . . .<br><br>—doctorlit has friends who discuss those Disney pins like they&#39;re crack cocaine: &quot;I know a guy who&#39;s coming down from Michigan next week, and he&#39;s bringing some <i>good</i> stuff!&quot;</p>

            <p>Allow me to share a fairly off-topic but tangentially connected story.<br><br>I was a kid. I&#39;d just learned about Figment the Dragon, and thought he was pretty cool. I&#39;d somehow gotten a particular pin that, I think, was just his head. It wasn&#39;t the one I wanted; I wanted a full-body one. (Unless it was the other way around; I forget.) I just liked the other one better. The adults around me discouraged me from exchanging the one I had because it was rare and more valuable. I did not care about this at all; I just wanted the one I liked better. Finally, at the last possible opportunity, I found someone who was willing and probably happy to trade with me and finally got the thing I wanted. I was not taken advantage of; the person I traded with very kindly made sure to explain things, I knew exactly what I was doing, and I <i>did not care</i> about the monetary value. Nonetheless, everyone was very upset that I&#39;d done it. All the enjoyment was sucked right out of it. {= /<br><br>For the record, my family was mostly very supportive of me. This incident sticks out in my memory precisely because of how <i>weird</i> it was. It&#39;s not like anybody was a serious collector of Disney pins or anything, either.<br><br>Moral of the story: They&#39;re just bits of metal and lacquer. They&#39;re for fun. Chill out, people.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>...unless our theme park was part of either Universal theme park.<br><br>That sounds plausible, given that the long of the premise I came up with behind the theme park was that this was an alternate of World One in which criticism is treated much less like the proverbial haters who are going to hate and more like a necessary part of growing as a writer/artist/person.

            <p>A ride through Rina/Ave&#39;s missions, with the steepness of the track at any given moment determined by how much angst and/or drama is found in that mission. The Little Miss Mary drop is the tallest in the country.<br><br>(The country is probably New Caledonia, which as far as I can tell doesn&#39;t actually have any theme parks. So I&#39;m technically correct, which is the <i>best kind</i> of correct!)<br><br>As for shops: in the style of the Build-a-Bear chain, how about Adopt-a-Mini? You look through the catalogue and select one of the many, many types of mini, which is brought to you to stuff and dress as you please. You choose a name for it - which has to be a plausible misspelling from its canon, of course! - and get a lovely adoption certificate (and a voucher for a half-price bacon/fried egg sandwich at the Cafeteria, naturally).<br><br>For the kids, I propose one of those rides where individual cars move at a steady low speed around a flat, twisting track, through a landscape of plants, statues, and anamatronics (there&#39;s one at Legoland Windsor which is full of Lego dinosaurs). Obviously it would be the story of a mission, perhaps a classic Jay and Acacia tale?<br><br>(I hope anyone who still plays Rollercoaster Tycoon or its relatives is paying attention here!)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>It would be so popular and people would love it. I would love it. Enough said.<br><br>The Aviator rollercoaster seems a bit problematic, since in order to have the tall drop, it couldn&#39;t be indoors, but make it an outdoor ride and you&#39;re pretty limited in terms of any story you can tell. Any idea how to solve this conundrum?<br><br>For the kids... I don&#39;t see any kids&#39; section in this theme park, because the subject of bad fanfiction is pretty nuanced and I would hate to kids glomming on to a super-simplified but wholly wrong version of it that they came up with in their little brains. There&#39;s a reason we only allow folks 13 and up on the Board. But then again, there could be a Nursery-themed section, with a focus on the PPC as a universe and little to no mention of Mary Sues, let alone killing them. Or we could, purely for the purpose of the park, come up with some &quot;PPC Jr.&quot; sub-universe that presents simple, non-aggressive writing advice for children.<br><br>-Twistey</p>

            <p>... a PPC Training Session, with agents from different departments coming in to demonstrate crucial techniques, all leavened with a healthy dose of humour. Some possibilities:<br><br>-As you say, DOGA&#39;s Agent Dafydd demonstrates the use of a flamethrower. He&#39;s supposed to demonstrate the <i>safe</i> use of a flamethrower, but, well... Dafydd.<br><br>-A Slasher demonstrates an exorcism, with a bit of smoke-and-mirrors tech to show the wraith.<br><br>-An Assassin or two show off hunting a Suvian in a pantomime-style section. &quot;She&#39;s behind you!&quot;<br><br>-An Untangler attempts to demonstrate use of a portal to return canons to their own worlds... but the canon characters are mischievous and the Remote Activator plays up. I&#39;m seeing glowing blue doors on both sides of the stage, with identically made-up actors popping in and out of them.<br><br>-A demonstration from the Department of Redundancy Department gets interrupted by the Repetitive Department of Repetition. A verbal battle ensues, which has to be broken up by a DIA team.<br><br>-A DoSAT tech demonstrates some PPC tech. She calls in various other agents to find the Suvian the CAD is detecting in the crowd.<br><br>-A hapless FicPsych nurse attempts to teach the audience meditation and calming exercises - while some of the agents from earlier muck about behind her. (I suspect Dafydd.)<br><br>-A recurring gag where the OOC Hobbits agents keep thinking its <i>their</i> turn to do a section now, only for someone else to be announced. Because why <i>not</i> pick on DOOCH?<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Okay so I think I may be the only one here who knows about WBWL fics and that... needs to be fixed.<br><br>So WBWL stands for Wrong-Boy-Who-Lived. These stories are... canon!Sues. They usually have Morally Ambiguous/Grey or Dark Harry, Hermione Bashing, Weasley Bashing, Potters Bashing, &amp; Dumbledore Bashing.<br><br>So basically, Harry has a twin and that twin is mistaken for the BWL. And his parents are usually alive.<br><br>In terms of ‘Sue tropes, these are probably unique because the oc, Harry’s Twin, is not the Mary Sue. The oc, in fact, is usually arrogant, brash, loud, and obnoxious. Also, Harry usually beats him EASILY despite the fact the the oc has been apparently training his entire life (the grammar is also really good... so there’s also that, at least).<br><br>Oh, and Harry’s abuse at the hands of the Dursleys’ is often exaggerated or added to unnecessarily, he is usually some sort of prodigy, and at least half have Good!Slytherins. I wouldn’t even be surprised if someone made him have wandless magic.<br><br>Also, if Harry’s not sent to the Dursleys, then James and Lily abuse/neglect him. For ABSOLUTELY NO REASON.<br><br>Also, there are currently 179 works in it’s ao3 tag. 179 works. And that’s not even counting the ones on FFN-</p>

            <p>doesn&#39;t mean we don&#39;t know.<br><br>Trust me, I&#39;ve dived into more WBWL fics than I can remember. And, if you dive deep enough you&#39;ll find there are the occasional ones that aren&#39;t too bad so don&#39;t tar them all with the same brush. You&#39;re also forgetting the &#39;fics that have Neville as the fake Boy-Who-Lived, of which some of those are quite interesting too, both in a good or bad way. <br><br>So, I&#39;m not *quite* sure why you felt like you needed to exclaim this, rather over-used fanfic cliche to us, I&#39;m fairly certain Ix has missioned a WBWL &#39;fic before. But thank you for your... efforts to keep us notified of such things, perhaps tone it down in the future. I&#39;m not saying such spontaneity is bad, I&#39;m just saying perhaps think before you post sometimes.<br><br>Novastorme</p>

            <p>... yeah, probably.<br>I think talking about WBWL fics just gave me the illusion of being productive (lol), because the only other thing I’ve done is scroll around the legendary badfic page and read part of My Immortal (also listened part of the dramatic reading, but I clicked out of it).<br><br> Also, I’m kinda curious as to which section the agents who PPCed the WBWL fic were in, since I’m planning on PPCing one for my first mission.</p>

He couldn’t move it at all, but at least it was no longer causing him pain.<br><br>So, when the butler unveiled a platter of perfectly cooked salmon, he was extremely angry.<br><br>“Salmon?” he said incredulously. “Did it have to be today?”<br><br>“And custard for dessert,” responded Holly, with her smuggest expression.<br><br>Tiger only just managed to stop himself from groaning audibly.<br><br>“Holly won,” Francis remarked mildly, “so she gets to choose the meal.”<br><br>Under his breath, Tiger muttered, “And of course she chose salmon and custard because she likes it and it has absolutely nothing to do with the fact that she knows I hate it…”<br><br>As if placing a potentially deadly spell on his hand, then “killing” him in a training battle, wasn’t enough, she just had to add insult to injury by ensuring that his least favourite food was served.<br><br>The other problem was that he was left-handed, so he wouldn’t be able to cut the salmon the normal way. He stared at the slice of orange fish which had just been placed on his plate and wondered how hungry he really was and whether it was worth the effort of trying to cut it up for something he didn’t even like.<br><br>That was when he came up with the idea of using magic: a basic Cutting Spell shouldn’t tax his abilities too much and would get the job done without having to try and use the wrong hand. <br><br>Carefully, he began chanting the same few words again and again, watching as the salmon was scored with lines. When he was done he felt a little tired, but at least that ordeal was over. Now all he had to do was actually eat the disgusting thing. <br><br><br><br>Was there some kind of reference in that one as well? If so, I missed it.</p>

            <p>In a roundabout sense, Salmon is a type of fish, what do hands have (fingers), and angry is in their as a personal reference only 5 other people would get and I&#39;m the only one of them in the PPC. But can you think of anything that relates to fish, fingers and custard?</p>

            <p>&quot;Are you <i>absolutely</i> sure this isn&#39;t cheating?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Of course it&#39;s not. People from other species have got just as much right to play as anyone from World One. It&#39;s just a shame that Meyerpire in ESAS went and got herself turned into a human, to be honest, she would&#39;ve been really useful to have around-&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yes, okay, we get it. We got it the last time you brought that up.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I was just saying-&quot;<br><br>&quot;You were just repeating yourself. About twelve times.&quot;<br><br>A third speaker broke in. &quot;Can we PLEASE focus on the task at hand, ladies? Thirty seconds until kickoff and we&#39;re in the Pacific Trials if we win this. Sound off.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yeah, okay. Maturin, projectile DPS.&quot; Maturin&#39;s tone let everyone know she was the first speaker, mostly on account of her exasperation and how it wasn&#39;t doing much to mask her nerves. &quot;Going Brig.&quot;<br><br>&quot;MoonGerbil, hitscan deeps, Zarya.&quot; Gerbil was the second speaker and had a pronounced Valley Girl accent, which seemed rather at odds with what was going on.<br><br>&quot;DGale, offtank, D.Va.&quot; This was a fourth voice, slightly spiky and tired-sounding. &quot;Like I&#39;d give up the chance to pilot a giant robot mech suit thingy.&quot;<br><br>&quot;ThingWithAllTheTeeth, flex support.&quot; This voice was, unlike the others, male. It was older, too, warm and slightly accented. &quot;I&#39;m picking Torb. You know I&#39;m picking Torb-&quot;<br><br>&quot;<i>AL!</i>&quot; DGale all but screeched.<br><br>&quot;Kidding, kidding, I&#39;m on Lucio, don&#39;t worry.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Um. Is my mic too loud? Um. Hi everyone, I&#39;m Drakie, and I&#39;m a heal support and I&#39;ll be playing Moira today! This&#39;ll be fun!&quot; This last voice was just... sweet. And even nervier than Maturin&#39;s.<br><br>&quot;Drakie, your mic&#39;s fine the way it is and so are you. Right then. OzCOM. Main tank. Going Rein, because GOATS is good on attack and we can run it on control very easily. We set?&quot;<br><br>&quot;All systems cleared for takeoff and Caroline&#39;s running smooth as you like,&quot; ThingWithAllTheTeeth said with more than a hint of pride. &quot;Let&#39;s do this!&quot;<br><br>And the team barrelled out of spawn on Sanctum. Four women, one middle-aged man, and one very fluffy Flareon. What a bunch of misfits and freaks they had here.<br><br>They loved it.<br><br>---<br><br>Now, I&#39;m pretty sure Nova follows competitive <i>Overwatch</i> just as much as I do, so he won&#39;t mind me mentioning that Apply, Effect, and Hydration are the monikers (or handles, if you prefer) of professional Overwatch League stars. The vignette just kinda flowed from there. Just so everyone&#39;s on board, the agents are as follows:-<br><br>Maturin: Cass Aubrey, DMS (Aubrey and Maturin are the protagonists of Patrick O&#39;Brien&#39;s <i>Master and Commander</i> series, and Cass was named for the former of that pair.)<br><br>MoonGerbil: Em Perilled, DMS (Em is a weregerbil, which comes up from time to time when she shows up in my board vignettes.)<br><br>DGale: Karen Shawcross, NPC (Karen&#39;s overriding LO is Ace McShane of the Whoniverse, real name Dorothy Gale McShane.)<br><br>ThingWithAllTheTeeth: First Technician Albert Sproggins, NPC (The Thing With All The Teeth is one of the many horrible things, or possibly Things, that haunts the A/V Division courtesy of Wobbles the Clown; Al was a former member of that Division before his transfer to Non-Propaganda Communications)<br><br>Drakie: Gabrielle, DWT (Drakie is Gabrielle&#39;s nickname for Draco Malfoy, upon whom she has an inexplicable crush. You nickname your favourites, you see.)<br><br>OzCOM: Field Commander Lola McCandless, DIA (Lola is ex of XCOM: Enemy Unknown... sort of. Her homefic (again, sort of) was a mega crossover based on crossing XCOM with a bunch of Weird Things. She&#39;s from Australia, hence the name.)<br><br>And, because this drabble is a bit short, here&#39;s the strips for if/when they get into the Overwatch League Itself:<br><br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/5OdTpjk.png"><br><br>Presenting the HQ Generics!<br><br>Poorly designed in Flag Maker Junior and MS Paint!<br><br>I am Bad At Things! =]</p>

            <p>Have you ever dreamed about the PPC? As in, literally dreamed?<br><br>Last night, I dreamed that I was on a mission with one of my sisters (not dramaticsoprano, a different one), and we were on a mission into a LotR-Elf-in-modern-Earth fic, and a VERY bad choice of words made a bystander do something evil. My sister and I were soon arguing about how OOC the bystander was. And I suspect the whole thing may have been my subconscious attempting catharsis over a serious open-mouth-insert-foot blunder I made last Sunday (I will give no details).</p>

So I started changing the color of the wall, painting on it with my fingers, and so on.<br><br>This was fun until I, in my sleepy lack of common sense, decided to try declaring the wall to be urple.

            <p>I&#39;ve been here a little while and I figured it was about time.

            <p>I went off to try catching up a little (I&#39;ve been...not hugely active on the Board for the past few weeks or so, given that I&#39;ve been really busy), and there&#39;s a post down-Board with EPL volunteering as a beta? If she did beta your permission request, she ought to be credited as well :) Probably just an oversight, but something to bear in mind for the future--if someone&#39;s been your beta, it&#39;s only polite to credit them (unless they specifically request you don&#39;t. Doesn&#39;t happen often, to my knowledge, but once in a while there&#39;s a reason. The most frequent reason I&#39;ve heard was &#39;I don&#39;t feel I really did enough to be credited as a beta reader&#39;).<br><br>~Z</p>

            <p>EPL had volunteered to help, but hadn&#39;t actually done anything until, like, the night of me posting the Request, and I wasn&#39;t sure they were done yet and I just didn&#39;t want to credit them until I knew for sure it counted. No disrespect to EPL, of course - I appreciate your help a bunch. So yeah that&#39;s why I hadn&#39;t credited them yet. *shrug*</p>

            <p>Ah. So.<br><br>I&#39;ve read through this, and I thought I&#39;d give a few comments. Namely...well.<br><br>I do like Summer. I liked him a little better from his bio, funnily enough, but he&#39;s still fine in an actual scene. Your writing is also pretty good, from my reading; I didn&#39;t go trying to pick it apart, but nothing really jumped out at me when it came to SPaG, etc. Your descriptive writing is also nice. So that&#39;s great already.<br><br>Thing is, Nic...I really do not get Nic. He&#39;s, ah--well, look, I could see someone like him being interesting to read about, but as it is? He&#39;s too much for me in the bio, and he&#39;s too much in the story. He&#39;s confusing to read; he careens around the room, he changes every other second and it&#39;s unclear whether he does or doesn&#39;t have control over it (he seems not to right up until the bit where he looks like Nico and then it suddenly gets more ambiguous)...for me, he&#39;s just really, really too much. I think he&#39;d need to be toned down quite a bit for me to even just not feel exhausted trying to keep up with him. The main thing I did like about him, beyond that he seems to mean well and like Summer, is the bit with the mac and cheese--the little detail about somehow changing cheese powder to actual cheese was amusing and *did* feel like something I&#39;d want to read about both in general and I think in PPC writing, too. I think Nic at the heart of him is a nice sort of character; I just think his current window dressing, so to speak, is far too busy to really get along with as a reader.<br><br>A few more technical things:<br><br>-Had Nic and Summer already met? In the first piece it sounds very much like they know each other, and not at all just superficially (they seem to have a grasp of each other&#39;s names, personalities, powers...they read like they&#39;re already good friends)--yet Nic&#39;s only been there a week, there&#39;s no clarification regarding previous meetings, and it kind of seems like they&#39;re moving into a new RC (rather than Nic moving in with Summer? Moving into a new RC would be perfectly fine, it just...really isn&#39;t clear what&#39;s going on and why). It&#39;s never explained if and where they&#39;ve met before, or even if it&#39;s a new RC (unless I just missed a mention)...I think we need more information, preferably in the text. We&#39;re very much lacking context.<br><br>-The destroying the RC piece: I...really wouldn&#39;t mind a little more context there, as well. Why did Nic already go in? Or did he not go on the mission? Did Summer even *finish* the mission? Where he was on a mission *to* is less important, since it&#39;s not the focus (though I *am* curious), but the other questions...again, we&#39;re missing just enough context to have a few too many niggling questions while reading.<br><br>-The writing just feels...it&#39;s very *busy*. I think a lot of that is due to writing Nic--who might work a little better as a cartoon character, honestly, except that even there he&#39;d be very hard to keep track of. It doesn&#39;t really help me picture the scenes as more than exhausting shenanigans, at times.<br><br>The badfic: I don&#39;t know much about the canon, so I&#39;ll take your word for it. Personally, I don&#39;t often go for fics that *warn* they&#39;ll be OOC, but that&#39;s my personal preference. You&#39;re probably good on this front.<br><br>(Do I recognize you? Of course I recognize you. I&#39;d say you&#39;re pretty well integrated into the community, by this point.)<br><br>And one last thing: I know this has gone through at least one other iteration. Good for you for putting so much work into it! I&#39;m guessing Thoth is the only one who betaed this particular version, as no one else is listed?<br><br>Personally, at this point I&#39;d say Permission Denied (but able to be obtained by remembering to give a touch more context and also toning down Nic--where is he *from*, by the way?), but I really wouldn&#39;t mind a second opinion.<br><br>~Z<br><br>PS: ;lakjsdf never, ever fail to repeatedly copy what you&#39;re typing in here and keep an eye on your keyboard. I&#39;m using a different one than usual, and hit the back button when I went for where the tilde key normally is. Thank *everything* that when I went forward to the page everything I&#39;d written was still there. Wow.</p>

            <p>Yeah, I gotta say everything here is completely fair. It was never really my interest to explain *how* Nic and Summer met, so I mighta... kinda skimped on that part. As for the mission, wow. I can&#39;t believe I totally overlooked all that stuff. Shame on me for not getting more opinions, I guess! As for all the business of Nic, yeah, I can kinda see how he would stress the reader, but *sighs* his chaotic personality is near and dear to my heart. I honestly felt like he would work *way better* in the context of a mission... I&#39;m not really sure how to chill him out over normal activities, but I suppose that&#39;s my problem. <br><br>Thanks a lot for the feedback! Due in part to my own impatience, I have kinda been flying blind on the whole reception front and it&#39;s really good to get another pair of eyes. I&#39;ll keep what you said in mind as I make my revisions. </p>

            <p>I once read this original badfic that was written with the “humans are slaves to vampires (in the future)” trope, and (I think) the main character’s name was Rogue, but it kept being spelled “rouge” and that was very uncomfortable. I think it was spelled wrong for the whole fic, for whatever reason. Also, I have no idea why I’m typing this.</p>

So at first I thought it was a typo, but then it kept being the male pronoun and it tells us how she got picked last for sports teams! It even mention Dudley’s name!

            <p>Not a rhetorical question. What about this fic makes you want to spork out your eyes, beat your head against a wall, and/or pull out your hair?

            <p>The biggest issue I have with this thing is how Sam responds to her parents being murdered by Voldemort. First of all, she doesn&#39;t even think about trying to stop Voldemort killing them, she just runs. That&#39;s not an illogical decision, but it is a pretty heartless one, and surprising, since she claims to have a good relationship with them.<br><br>Then, instead of going to the magical authorities, she goes to the Muggle police and whines in the narration about how she can&#39;t explain everything to them. ... Why?<br><br>I&#39;ve seen no sign of grief from her yet. She&#39;s plenty angry, but she seems to accept the situation well enough, so I dunno if that counts. If the reality of the loss hits her later, she might get a pass on the basis that everyone responds to death differently.<br><br>On the plus side, I think the connection that gets her to Hogwarts is fairly solid. I think everyone has a good reason for knowing what they know and not knowing what they don&#39;t know. Dumbledore having connections with the heads of other wizarding schools makes sense, and he also has a spy within the Death Eaters, because of course he does. (Calling it now, Harry is Zachary Foote. This seems so transparent I have to wonder if it&#39;s not actually a red herring.) And it&#39;s established in canon that blood matters, so yoinking Sam across the pond to take advantage of the protection of her family holds up for me.<br><br>I was going to question how this works as Harry &amp; co.&#39;s seventh year, but then I realized it was first published in 2006, so there you go. <i>Deathly Hallows</i> hadn&#39;t come out yet. That doesn&#39;t explain how Sirius Black is still alive, but him coming back from beyond the Veil somehow was a fairly common assumption back in the day.<br><br>Unless it really goes off the rails later, I wouldn&#39;t PPC this for the simple reason that it&#39;s not bad. There are some SPaG errors and I have some questions, but they&#39;re not deal-breaking ones for me. Not yet. And if a fic is going to be mission-worthy, it tends to become apparent pretty quickly.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I&#39;m honestly not seeing any major red flags, which I didn&#39;t expect because I hadn&#39;t even glanced at it when I made my previous post. The thing that most grabs my attention is the Halloween costume ball, but only because it bears a weird surface similarity to a bit of the fic I&#39;m currently sporking.

Actually, all three of your new-thread posts could probably have been made as replies to the WBWL post.<br><br>The Board isn&#39;t moving so quickly that it&#39;s a really big deal right now, but there are a limited number of threads that display on the first page, and each new thread pushes an older one off. That&#39;s why we discourage posting more than one new thread in a row, especially if they&#39;re on the same topic. In this case, adding to existing badfic threads is even mentioned in the Constitution (article 21.5), so please give that another gander, and check out the <a href="https://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/FAQ:_The_Board">FAQ: The Board</a>, too.<br><br>Also, protip: Avoid typing in all-caps.

            <p>Hello again / Hello (delete as appropriate depending on if you recognise my username or not).<br><br>For those of you that don’t know me, or just don’t remember, I’m not really actively involved in any fandoms, but I like to read/watch fantasy and sci-fi, and I watch a lot of anime. The show I’m most excited about at the moment is the new series of Sword Art Online, which I’ve been looking forward to since it was announced.<br><br>I’ve been absent for a long time now, but finally wandered back. I had hoped that when I came back I’d be able to post an Interlude or something, but I haven’t actually finished any writing for a while now, so there’s that plan fallen at the first hurdle. So instead I thought I’d share some things that have caught my eye since I was last around here.<br><br>First, the obligatory <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PSFN2r6bXY"> Tolkien-themed link</a>. Yes, I know, it’s random youtube link - but I promise it isn’t a rickroll. Because <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uXH5baOwcc">this one</a> is the rickroll. <br>(Does it still count as a rickroll if you tell people that’s what you’re linking to? I’m not sure). <br><br>Because I don’t have any of my own writing to share, I’ll share some I found: <a href="https://www.eviscerati.org/fiction/Pay-Me-Bug/novel/Pay-Me-Bug-Chapter-01"> Pay Me, Bug!</a> is a sci-fi heist story, following the (mis)adventures of a smuggling crew, who have a (slightly undeserved) reputation for carrying out an ‘impossible’ job. Life gets a little interesting for them when someone comes along with an offer they can’t refuse, and asks for a repeat performance.<br><br>I found the characters interesting, with good humour, and the explanations of the sci-fi tech were detailed enough to give a good idea of how it worked, without bogging it down in technobabble.<br><br>And finally, for anyone that has a few hundred free hours and an interest in Dungeons &amp; Dragons, I can thoroughly recommend Critical Role. It’s a D&amp;D game that gets livestreamed every week, with the episodes posted to youtube too. The players and the DM are all professional voice actors, and they really get in to their characters. It’s very entertaining, and it’s given me a bunch of ideas for my own campaigns.<br><br>It’s been running for a few years, so there’s a huge archive of it which can be found on <a href="http://localhost:3000/posts/scrape/2018/&lt;a%20rel="><a href="https://geekandsundry.com/critical-role-episode-1/">https://geekandsundry.com/critical-role-episode-1/</a></a>&quot;&gt; Geek &amp; Sundry.<br><br>-Irish <br></p>

            <p>Well, at the moment I suspect most people would know me as &#39;that guy who used to be around more&#39; - so I&#39;m glad I&#39;m known for something else too :)<br><br>I&#39;ve heard of <i>The Irresponsible Captain Tylor</i> (I&#39;d actually misremembered it as &#39;Taylor&#39;), but never seen any. Was very pleased to see that it seemed to be available on crunchyroll, only to discover that it was some kind of spin-off with 3 minute long episodes that... wasn&#39;t that good. I&#39;m going to assume that the original is better. <br><br>Sadly it doesn&#39;t look like I will be able to watch it, as the only Amazon listings I can find are US imports, which I don&#39;t think my UK stuff will play. Found some clips on youtube though, and it does seem cool - I&#39;ll have to have a hunt around for full episodes.

            <p>That is one of the most surreal videos I&#39;ve seen all year. Nice one.<br><br>Well, I read a lot of sci-fi, so I&#39;m used to AI&#39;s ranging from benevolent to psychotic to in desperate need of human help. So yeah, AI can be cool - and I&#39;ll always take a book recommendation. What have you got?<br><br>Hmm, I&#39;m choosing to believe that that&#39;s &#39;bark&#39; as in the sound a dog makes, so I guess I&#39;ve just been given some kind of chocolate-scented acoustic wave?

            <p>Thank you. Although I notice that this appears to be the Catachan pattern flak armour, which is basically a vest (but at least it&#39;s a nice dark camo green), so I&#39;m guessing that expected lifespan is more like 15 <i>minutes</i>.<br><br>Yup, messed up the link there, which is odd because I&#39;m sure I tested it. This one should work: <a href="https://geekandsundry.com/critical-role-episode-1/"><a href="https://geekandsundry.com/critical-role-episode-1/">https://geekandsundry.com/critical-role-episode-1/</a></a><br><br>Yeah, I&#39;ve been a fan of LoadingReadyRun for several years now. I&#39;ve found Dice Friends to be a bit hit-and-miss: I very much enjoyed Escape From Semolo Plateau, and it&#39;s sequel, but some of the others I just couldn&#39;t get in to. However, my favourite RPG series by those guys is the awesomely named <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asPwTthfJFk">Temple of the Lava Bears</a> from a few years ago.<br><br>-Irish<br></p>

            <p>I think Catachan flak armor is sub-dermal, but really they don&#39;t need it. Being able to shoot them implies you can see them through the thick foliage.</p>

            <p>Out of interest, do you prefer campaign 1 or 2? (I know it&#39;s not really a fair comparison at the moment, due to the huge difference in lengths at the moment).<br><br>I think I prefer the later storylines from the first campaign, but find the characters of the second to be more interesting.<br><br>-Irish </p>
