            <p>There was some discussion on the Discord a while back of a phenomenon I like to refer to as &quot;Rule 34.B&quot;, which states, &quot;If it exists, there is a perplexingly provocative Halloween costume of it.&quot;<br><br>Our good friend Larfen J. Stocke, with his usual quick perception, proposed a fictional character for which no sexy Halloween costume exists. As it turns out, I have become so attached to my little rule that I had to rectify that at once.<br><br>I place at least 10% of the blame on Larf.<br><br>Without further ado, I present to you my Halloween project this year: <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Egm5-e_3ui8E36UhU6bNVQfw2mUunWy1">The Sexy Sunflower</a> <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=14IeCA9gNm3EKgYnff7or9wNUT4VW9eik">Official Costume</a>. (These pictures are somewhat NSFW and, in my opinion, somewhat disturbing. Bear that in mind.)<br><br>Thank you for viewing my project. In the absence of Bleeprin being a real thing, here is a picture of a kitten dressed as a bat.<br><img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51OrXGcuLiL._SX425_.jpg"></p>

<li>This was actually very funny. I didn&#39;t find that disturbing or attractive at all, just funny. Lucky me.<br>2. Isn&#39;t there a discouraged ship between the SO and the Marquis de Sod? Wonder what the latter flower would think of this...<br>3. Haha! I know a number of other characters for which Rule 34 and Rule 34.B don&#39;t apply, because they&#39;re too obscure! (Not telling you, and most of said characters are my original characters who haven&#39;t been published yet, so you can&#39;t guess either!) Hah!<br><br>-Twistey</li>

            <p>Actually, I do have one suggestion (which I made before, but still think it&#39;s worth saying): Sexy-up a suit (miniskirt or hotpants, a cropped suit blazer, tie tied way too loosely, etc).<br><br>A+ work, though. The green body paint was a nice touch.</p>

            <p>Yes, it&#39;s that time again: <a href="https://nanowrimo.org">NaNoWriMo</a>, 30 days (29 left!) to write a full, 50K word novel. It&#39;s one of the best ways I know of to break the &#39;I should probably start writing&#39; jam, and I heartily recommend it to everyone. And remember, as the old motto says: No plot? No problem!<br><br>Predictably enough, I&#39;m on the website as <a href="https://nanowrimo.org/participants/huinesoron">Huinesoron</a>. This is my sixth NaNo, and this year I&#39;m trying something a little different. (No, Nesh, <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=319633;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">not <i>Quon Vet</i></a>.)<br><br><i>Hearthfires</i> is a collection of short stories covering a bewildering variety of topics. The one I&#39;ve started is the tale of Ceridwen, a mage in the service of the last reigning Prince of Wales, but the plan includes everything from a Greek Mythology mystery to a post-Singularity... uh, mystery again, come to think of it. It&#39;s not <i>all</i> detective stories, I promise. ^_^<br><br>So who else is taking part? And what are you working on?<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>A bit, kinda? I kinda completely failed to prepare at all in October, and when November finally rolled around I had to scramble to pick a story idea and decide what to do with it. Then when I finally made up mind I was forced to choose between fixing my sleep schedule and doing D&amp;D stuff or NaNo, D&amp;D won out.<br><br>I&#39;m still in it, though! Just starting a week late, that&#39;s all. I&#39;ve decided to try my hand at one of the novels I mentioned in the elevator pitch thread you posted a while back, The New London Paranatural Society. Featuring the adventures of a British army veteran, a young mad scientist with a certain distaste for gravity, a Scottish werewolf in a very fine waistcoat, and a cloth dragon named Patches, as they search for the anonymous head of the Society who has mysteriously fallen silent. </p>

            <p>I actually remember taking part a few years ago. The ending result included multiple Sues, excessive dialogue, and match butchering of various mythologies. Needless to say, it has been destroyed. <br>This year, I’m probably not reaching the word count goal, but I will be writing a collection of short stories featuring two increasingly frustrated people who are permanently in the bodies of teens and get stuck into various universes that always eventually get at least one Mary Sue invasion, and every time the invasion is taken care of, they get stuck in another universe.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m <a href="https://nanowrimo.org/participants/collin-frisbee">Collin Frisbee</a> on the site if you want to send me rude messages over it in order to slow me down and thus gain an edge over me in the competition. <br><br>I&#39;m writing <i>Lamppost Saint</i>, a sort of episodic surrealist journey across a barren, haunted Sydney, starring a man in a full-body prosthesis suffering constant phantom sensations and generally having a tough time telling what&#39;s real and what isn&#39;t. <br><br>It&#39;s a sort of spiritual successor to an earlier story I wrote (that I have not shared with anyone here), and fulfils a very similar purpose to me, in that I intend to use it as a way to sort of - go nuts, I guess, and have fun with all the imagery and kooky dream logic. <br><br>It&#39;s based a lot on my interest in folklore and weird fortean cryptozoological kind of stuff, and was influenced a lot by Hellboy and stuff by China Mieville, and the way that, for instance, many UFO stories very much feel like old fairy abduction stories, but from a modern, more scientific context. There&#39;s this really bizarre and fun dream-logic to many old fairy tales and folktales, and capturing a sort of similar feeling, from a modern context, is one of my main goals. <br><br>I mean, there&#39;s actual plot there, too, no worries mate. <br><br>However it ends up, it has been fun so far! </p>

            <p>I&#39;ve tried to get started several years, but never even got in the first day of writing. But this year I did, so I&#39;m very excited!<br><br>I&#39;m actually cracking down on a fanfiction, <i>Kathryn&#39;s Adventures in Middle-Earth</i> (a stand-in title), which is, as you may have guessed, a girl in Middle-earth story. It&#39;s not satire; I&#39;ve set myself the challenge of taking this premise and taking it seriously.<br><br>I&#39;ve set myself a couple of other challenges as well; I generally avoid first-person narration because it&#39;s hard for me to get into characters&#39; heads, but this will be told in the form of a series of letters from the titular Kathryn to her mother, who is presumably still alive and well in the real world. I used to write a lot of letters as a kid, so I thought it would be easier than straight-up first person. So far I&#39;m discovering it&#39;s really not.<br><br>I also discovered today that because the first half of the letters are written with some time between the events and the writing and the second half are written more or less immediately after the events, character development is a difficult thing to show. Some of it is happening days, weeks, or even months before they&#39;re written about and the narrator will be somewhat aware of it. Some of it, though, is happening in the immediate past and it&#39;s unlikely she&#39;s going to realize how she&#39;s changing and growing. One thing I&#39;m trying to work in is self-contradiction. Earlier this year I read the diaries of Christopher Columbus and it was fascinating to see how his viewpoint changed as time went on. As an example, in earlier entries he thought of aloe as a very valuable commodity and gathered as much of it as he could. Later entries, though, referred to it as a very commonplace thing and he stopped collecting it. I suspect this is because he discovered how common it is in that part of the world. This is naturally never overtly acknowledged in the writing of the diary, but the diligent reader can pick it up. I&#39;m hoping to capture a similar quandary in Kathryn&#39;s letters, for the purposes of both realism and character development.<br><br>But then, I probably shouldn&#39;t be thinking of this too much at this stage. It&#39;s just the first draft. Still, if I manage to pull it off properly, I think the letter format will be one of the great strengths of the story.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m stretched a bit thin this time around. I&#39;ve got two short films to write, produce, direct, edit... and two essays as well. <br><br>That being said, I <i>am</i> halfheartedly poking at a superhero story featuring two old favorite Mutants and Masterminds characters of mine, Phantasm and Galeforce. One&#39;s a petty supervillain, one&#39;s the star hero of her home city, and together they form a sort of buddy-cop alliance.<br><br>Yours sounds much better thought out.</p>

            <p>You know that feeling when a good fanfiction that&#39;s been going on for ages, finally ends? Especially when the ending is heart-wrenching yet glorious.<br>And all you want is for it to go on. I&#39;m utterly depressed, yet oddly happy that it&#39;s done, cause my story was a shot of depresso mixed with cocaine and suicide.<br><br>So sad </p>

            <p>So, since I spent a few hours straight reading it, here are my thoughts on the latest Laundry Files book (for those who don&#39;t know, the premise of this series is, roughly &quot;you can summon Lovcraftian horrors by performing computations (ie, running an app on your phone), and the government is (obviously) covering this up. But this is the government, so all the usual bureaucratic BS applies.&quot;, giving us a series that&#39;s a cross between Lovecraftian horror, spy novels, and an office comedy.)<br><br>So, first, the non-spoilery thoughts: the somewhat non-linear narrative was a bit confusing to follow (but that makes sense, given what the plot is). Also, the footnotes continue to be good stuff.<br><br>Now, spoilers (rot13&#39;d, or maybe they&#39;re in Old Enochian, or both): Guvf obbx jnfa&#39;g n &quot;vg tbg jbefr&quot; genva yvxr gur ynfg bar, juvpu vf n avpr oernx.

            <p><i>The Laundry Files</i> sound interesting!  Haven&#39;t read any yet, though.<br><br>As much as I enjoyed <i>Jessica Jones</i>, I think <i>Luke Cage</i> is currently my favorite of the Marvel shows on Netflix . . . Figures it would get canceled in the middle of me watching the first series!<br><br>Spoilers follow for <i>Daredevil</i> seasons one and two, <i>Jessica Jones</i> season one, and <i>Luke Cage</i> season one.<br><br>I think what made me like LC compared to the earlier series is the positive tone.  <i>Daredevil</i> and <i>Jessica Jones</i> were both incredibly dark: the former due to Daredevil&#39;s limits on how much progress he could make in gutting Hell&#39;s Kitchen&#39;s criminal underbelly in a short period of time, whether in a courtroom or masked on the streets, creating a tone of hopelessness; and the latter due to the wide and varied threat Kilgrave posed, and Jessica&#39;s constant fear of either herself or her loved ones falling under his control.  By contrast, LC is all about striving to move forward in the world.  Even the villains feel a lot more like ordinary people compared to Fisk and Kilgrave, and get a lot of screen time that develops them beyond their role as antagonists in the story.  I feel a lot more sympathy for them than I usually do with MCU villains, even against the backdrop of the crimes they commit to feed their ambitions.<br><br>Actually, that leads into another feature of LC that I liked.  The focus in DD and JJ was very much on the title characters and those immediately close to them.  It made the conflicts feel very constrained, even in the midst of a huge area like Hell&#39;s Kitchen.  LC, on the other hand, makes Harlem feel more like a community, with a lot of characters getting screen time in addition to Luke himself.  Actually, I&#39;m almost convinced Detective Knight got nearly the same amount of screen time as Luke himself.  It fits in with Luke&#39;s desire to lay low, having to be spurred into heroic action nearly every time he does something.<br><br>Ironically, despite its more positive tone compared to the other two shows so far, it had a much more ambiguous ending, while DD and JJ had more positive ones with a pretty clear stop to the conflicts of each season.  There were so many ups and downs in those last twenty minutes; if nothing else, it&#39;s got me excited for season two!  Diamondback winding up with Cage&#39;s powers (probably) is bad, but considering the Hammer Industries super-suit didn&#39;t give him the upper hand against Cage, I&#39;m actually not terribly concerned about that.  Cage is in prison, but Bobby Fish has the evidence to prove his innocence.  I love how incredibly book-ended the season was, too.  Episode one had Cottonmouth framed on screen with the crown in his office painting centered over his head, and the final episode had his cousin Mariah standing in the same room with a different painting crowning her.  Knight is also at the bar of Harlem&#39;s paradise in nearly identical disguises in both episodes, showing how little progress she and Luke have actually made towards ending the major organized crime in Harlem.  And as Luke says, &quot;Never backwards, always forwards.  But sometimes, you have to make backwards to go forwards.&quot;<br><br>Revealing that Reva had been manipulating Cage is an interesting choice.  She had been presented as such a good, almost paragon-like, portion of Cage&#39;s past, to the point that he abandoned Jones when he found out she was technically Reva&#39;s murderer.  And her feelings for him seemed so sincere in the flashback episode . . . I mean, I think she <i>was</i> sincere, but that makes it all the weirder that she was also trying to lead Cage into the experimenting regimen.  I guess we may never learn more about her at this point . . . I&#39;m especially confused as to why the video footage of Kilgrave&#39;s power origin were on her flash drive from Seagate.  Kilgrave was a child when he got his powers, so he couldn&#39;t possibly have been in the same program that Seagate was running.  Unless his parents were scientists at Seagate?  But I rather thought that scene took place in Britain, so . . .<br><br>The kiss between Mariah and Shades came out of absolutely nowhere.  I didn&#39;t pick up on a single romantic thread between them in all their interactions, and I don&#39;t really care to ship them because they&#39;re both bad guys anyway.<br><br>MCU-wise, it looks like <i>Cloak &amp; Dagger</i> and <i>Runaways</i> are both roughly next in the timeline.  I don&#39;t think either are on Netflix, so we&#39;ll have to see what happens there . . .<br><br>—doctorlit was convinced for most of the season that Shades had the power to force people to tell him the truth by looking them in the eye, because of a scene in the second episode<br><br>&quot;Man, you Harlem spoilers is off the chain.  I&#39;m going back to Hell&#39;s Kitchen, where it&#39;s safe.&quot; &quot;Man, you Harlem spoilers is off the chain.  I&#39;m going back to Hell&#39;s Kitchen, where it&#39;s safe.&quot; &quot;Man, you Harlem spoilers is off the chain.  I&#39;m going back to Hell&#39;s Kitchen, where it&#39;s safe.&quot;</p>

            <p>(*virtually yelling off to the virtual side* Yeah, you heard me, hS, I said monsters! That means you can&#39;t be an elf! ...No, you can&#39;t be an evil elf! ...*facepalm* *sigh...*)<br><br>You guessed it, it&#39;s another trashpost from me, in the same style as &quot;Boarders Described With Memes&quot;, or whatever I called it. This time, it has a fun little bit of fantasy flair. I&#39;ve been playing Dungeons and Dragons for a while now, and having a good time with it. I&#39;d especially like to let y&#39;all know that y&#39;all should be proud of me, because my character is the only one in the party with any morals whatsoever. (Yeah, I know, right? Twistey and morals do belong in the same sentence after all!)<br><br>But anyway, here&#39;s the idea: Based on your personality, what type of monster from Dungeons and Dragons would you be? If you have no clue, there&#39;s at least one PDF of the D&amp;D 5e Monster Manual online.<br><br>For example, I&#39;d say I&#39;m a Gelatinous Cube. I chose this monster because as I go through life, I have a tendency to absorb things I find, and make them a part of myself to the point where I have no clue what my life would be like without them, even though the obvious answer is &quot;exactly or almost exactly like how it was before I discovered the thing.&quot; I&#39;m a pretty well-meaning Gelatinous Cube, and most of the time, I absorb stuff purely because I love it so much, but a couple years back, I ingested something that has now made me mildly poisonous, and the same happened to the slime trail I leave behind. People don&#39;t take too kindly to being surprised with loss of a health point or two...<br><br>So, what about you people? What D&amp;D monsters would you most likely be? How would you spend your days down in the dungeon? I&#39;m looking forward to some humorous results!<br><br>-Twistey</p>

            <p>Right now over in Britain, our government is refusing to allow us to vote on the most important political decision of a generation: how (and whether!) the UK should leave the EU. They have taken a small majority vote in favour of some kind of leaving (acquired after a campaign in which the Leave campaign lied outright and repeatedly broke campaigning laws), and turned it into &#39;you&#39;ll get whatever we give you and like it&#39;.<br><br>A good deal? A bad deal? No deal whatsoever, and the UK left scrambling to pick up the pieces? We don&#39;t get a say. We don&#39;t get an opportunity to tell them we&#39;ve seen their idea of negotiations and would rather stick with Europe - or that we want to postpone a while until an acceptable deal can be sorted - or to tell them what we think is actually important in a Leave deal. All we get is &#39;you children voted to Leave; now let the grown-ups decide for you what that means&#39;.<br><br>Over in America, you <b>do</b> have a chance to vote. You don&#39;t have to wait another four years like we do, or watch your country be dragged out of every international treaty it&#39;s in, like we do.

<li>What does mana correspond to in this?<br>2. Me, warlike?<br>3. *Snrk* Window supply chain...<br>4. Have you heard of the game series <i>Axis and Allies</i>? I had the idea to make a Board-themed parody of it based on S.P.U.D.&#39;s and The Newbie Rebellion&#39;s fics in the last Badfic Games. Would this be compatible with the idea, or at least, would you be interested in making a map for it when I announce the idea?<br><br>-Twistey</li>

<li>Yeah, I just now reread and inferred that that was the case.<br>2. Hmph. I wouldn&#39;t consider myself warlike. Wild, yes. Untamed, definitely. But not warlike... on purpose, that is.<br>3. Windowpane jokes all around :P<br>4.

Far we have travelled, and long has been our return, but we bring word of many distant settlements and nations, scattered across the great ocean to the east.<br><br>Let it be known that this great expedition almost foundered ere it ever turned east. Our journey began with a traverse of the Central Rift, yet conditions have become rough in the rift of late, and worse! Overhead we sighted balloon-fleets of GMA and Aegis, joining forces with those of Scapegrace, Larfen, and Tomash in the west.<br><br>We were forced to break north, hoping for a break in the weather. A break we found - but it showed only forbidding rock, and the mountaintop fastness of Kaitlyn, only settlement on the land of the Magic Isle.<br><br>Swiftly we fled, braving the storms about Snowblaze to pass east at last. Many ships were lost in the thunderous weather, but almost we would rather have remained within than to emerge, for east of this land we call home, almost upon our very shores, rises the sea-city of Neshomeh. No succour we found there, under the blazing barrels of their guns, and we were forced to flee further into the east.<br><br>We finally made harbour in Hardric-Granz, and there we encountered travellers: a fleet of Matt Cipher, which we were told sailed the anti-Mana currents that flowed from the north-east. Indeed, at such a time of year they would normally be far out to sea, on their way to the underdome of Guardsman Tom amid the Boiling Seas - but a mysterious fleet had blocked them, swallowing up anti-mana and bringing a new Storm in its wake.<br><br>Suitably warned, we chose not to sail for Athena, but to continue east. Passing over the domes of the Uber Overlord, we found copious reserves of anti-mana, growing in strength as we continued our journey. Yet these, as with the northern flow, went not unclaimed: a fleet of ships we saw, armed with magical weapons and identified with the mystic number 61516.<br><br>We might have sailed further, yet a dire warning stood in our path: a black flag, and the name of the Badger. So we turned about, and passing to the south returned home by way of Iximaz and the southern harbour. We never saw the ruins of the ancient mountains, nor learned what became of the War-Queen of the elder days...</p>

While it may be true that we are &#39;objectively wrong&#39;, the defence benefits of claiming ultra-high concentrations of mana are considerable.<br><br>We conclude by discussing the latest remnant groups to come to our attention. Firstly, we have finally made direct contact with Hardric, and discovered that it is in fact a twin city, with gold-towered Granz standing on the slopes of a veritable mountain - possibly the last one remaining in this battered world.<br><br>The Hardric-Granz emmisaries have brought us further knowledge of the waters to their east: it seems that two undersea settlements, known as Athena and EAIUO (though we are told that they have longer &#39;true names&#39; which we are not permitted to hear), have been established in the cloudless east. Of note is that Athena has laid claim to the first supply of anti-mana that we have been told of. Once again, we would stress the deterrent value of overstating our own mana reserves.<br><br>Finally, there is word of three balloon fleets entering the region. Larfen, on the northern promontory of our own island, seems peaceful, but the others are both heavily armed. Helsinki is content to stay over the eastern waters, but Tomash is close by our southern shores, floating above the undersea mana reserves in the area...</p>

New ones.”<br><br>Snowblaze blinked. “Who? Where?” she asked, slightly nervous.<br><br>“To our south,” said Ice, “the balloon fleet of Larfen. They seem to be peaceful, according to Huinesoron.”<br><br>“I see,” responded Snowblaze. “Well, I suppose we ought to appear to be friendly. Tell them we come in peace, et cetera, et cetera. Now please can you leave me in peace? I need to finish this paperwork!”<br><br>“Yes, my lady,” said Ice. He bowed and left, and Snowblaze instantly returned to a more comfortable position.<br></p>

            <p>Equality? Sounds good to me. Humanity? Absolutely! Fundamentally important. ... Work...? As opposed to Socialism? ... Um...? That one surprises me, particularly when my Communism/Capitalism bar is... pretty balanced. Let&#39;s see what things were like back in January...<br><br>Alright. So, on individual scores... evidently, slightly less Constructivist, which, well, boo, if I&#39;m reading these details right. More into Rehabilitative Justice now, which is always good. Both Progressivism and Conservatism are down, which, uh... exists? Pretty disappointingly? Internationalism is up with Nationalism down, and considering where it seems nationalism leads, that&#39;s pretty dang good with me. Communism has remained the same while Capitalism has risen, which... I dunno? I suppose having an instinctive hiss towards anything that could vaguely be considered capitalist is just as bad as the same towards communism, though. It&#39;s pretty balanced, which seems good. Regulationism has gone up, and there&#39;s not much to say there... Ecology levels have gone up a little, which is good. And Revolutionism is down! Which is, in my opinion, a good thing. The fact that Reformism has also fallen... is not.<br><br>Also, I evidently am lightly vegan, which, uh... not really?

Our fair city, reborn from the ashes of the old world, is hailed as a beacon of pr-- of <i>civilisation</i> far and wide! Visitors have swarmed to our gates, braving the storm-belt to bring messages of peace from the underwater domes of Snowblaze to the north, and our sister city of doctorlit in the east.<br><br>And they&#39;re not the only ones! Sailors have landed in our docks, telling of a ship-city named Hieronymus; and our mages have received messages from Hardric, the city of gleaming spires on an island far to the east. Truly, this is a bountiful time to live in.<br><br>Though... we have also heard rumours of an aerial fleet bearing the banners of Delta Juliette, floating over the eastern tip of our own island, guarding the passage to another isle beyond. None can say for sure what lies there, but whispers speak of a city named Iximaz, armed with black-powder and mana alike...<br><br>hS</p>

Plortitics is no longer a land divided, because it is no longer <i>land</i>.<br><br>The Brass Wars of antiquity were devastating, but the Mage Wars of the latter days were beyond imagining. Mountains crumbled, the seas rose, and Plortitics sank deep into the oceans.<br><br>Now, on the scattered rocks that remain, in undersea domes and high-flying balloon-cities, the people of Plortitics strive to learn about their new world...<br><br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/sUqERLD.png"><br><br><i>First Huinesoronic mapping expedition in the Aftermath</i><br><br>Land! After days at sea, charting the ruthless Central Straits, we at last sighted land once more - proof that our Magic Isle does not stand utterly alone. We ascended the rocky cliffs, searching for signs of life, but found only ragged plants among the damp rocks. Mana we found aplenty, and the minds of the crew turned to the possibility of colonisation.<br><br>Then our cabin boy chanced to look up, and glimpsed movement beyond the patchy clouds. Calling for a spyglass, he looked closer, hoping to see perchance one of the great birds of the old world.<br><br>Alas! Instead he found a vast balloon, and many others following behind. Guns peppered their sides, and even from far below we could see them firing on invisible targets - whether training or in demonstration, we knew not.<br><br>What we do know, and know for sure, is that we of Huinesoron are not alone in these rough seas. The flag of Scapegrace still flies, above a city in the clouds.<br><br>hS</p>
