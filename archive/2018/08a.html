Also like the Pit, it houses a wide variety of fanfic, and by extension, a wide variety of badfic. It&#39;s basically the Pit with original!fic, art books, books being used as blogs, and lots of stuff that doesn&#39;t count as writing.<br><br>With the general consensus of enough Boarders, this site shall be known as the Other Pit of Voles, or the Other Pit for short.<br><br>While we&#39;re on the subject, I have a question: Where does the &quot;Voles&quot; in &quot;Pit of Voles&quot; come from? Does it come from &quot;plotholes?&quot;</p>

            <p>It was derived from calling AdultFanfiction.net the Über Pit of Voles, as I was unaware that another writing site was called the Circle of Lemmings. <br><br>My vote&#39;s on Naked Mole-Rattpad.<br><br>One thing&#39;s for sure, though: We need to decide on a nickname before we can make a page for it, so that nickname can be the title of the page like with the Pit.</p>

            <p>A bear is a type of guy. Its precise meaning varies, but the general idea is large (either with fat or muscle—typically a mix of both) and covered in hair. According to Wikipedia, hairy men of any build were referred to as bears until the terms &quot;otter&quot; and &quot;wolf&quot; arose to describe men of medium and slim builds. According to The Advocate, they <a href="https://www.advocate.com/comedy/2014/04/17/tbt-when-advocate-invented-bears">coined the term</a> in 1979, although it can be said for certain that the term gained traction in the 1980s, with the creation of Bear Magazine, the founding of bear groups, and the like.<br><br>In 1995, the International Bear Brotherhood flag came to be. I only knew of this flag until now because of a sidenote in Gengoroh Tagame&#39;s genuinely excellent (and family friendly, unlike his other stuff) manga &quot;My Brother&#39;s Husband&quot;, which I would highly recommend to anyone who likes adorableness. Unfortunately, the excellent &quot;Mike&#39;s Gay Culture Lectures&quot; segment I got that fact in were cut from the official English release (I read a scanlation before I got my hands on it), presumably on the assumption that readers in the more gay-friendly US and Canada would already know this stuff. :-(<br><br>So why does the term exist? Probably because the guys look kinda like bears. Or maybe it morphed from the term &quot;beards&quot;, another term referencing hairy men at the time. As for why it refers to gay men, that would be because the term lriginated and gained popularity in gay cultural circles, and thus became associated specifically with gay men.<br><br>I hope that makes sense.</p>

            <p>As the users. No, not you, don&#39;t worry. The badfic writers. No, still probably not you.<br><br>AO3 is the most popular pure-fanfic repository that allows for sexually explicit content. As a result, it is the first port of call for a lot of smut writers.

She is more comfortable up in the mountains than anywhere else in the world. She&#39;s also the most stereotypically Irish of the three inseparable Callahan siblings, and has a bit of a temper, which causes her to say things she regrets later. She was born with powers to manipulate earth, but couldn&#39;t use them well before she received training at HQ. Her earth powers are a little less versatile than that of an Earthbender in Avatar. As for her backstory, her birth parents are both deceased (her mother died giving birth to her younger brother and her father died working his risky job), but the Callahan kids found some good-hearted adoptive parents and some friends, including Miriam. Amber, her siblings, and Miriam all fell into a plothole together, and occasionally they wonder about how their families have been able to cope with losing them.<br><br>Name: Miriam Almstedt<br>Age: 17<br>Department: DOGA<br>Home &#39;Verse: See Amber<br>Nationality: American (Swedish background)<br>Species: Human or fox, but never in between<br><br>It probably says something that Amber and Miriam ended up partners despite having known each other before recruitment. In contrast to Amber&#39;s tomboy nature, Miriam is a girly-girl who swoons over boys, knows how to do makeup (as opposed to Amber), and gets queasy at the sight of blood. She has both the ability to turn into a fox and to manipulate gravity, although the second one is limited to one object at a time and by her stamina. Both of these powers were obtained from magical accidents that happened at family reunions in Sweden. She also has apparently sighted a few monsters right out of Scandinavian folklore at said family reunions, but downplays it whenever anyone asks because she thinks people won&#39;t believe her.<br><br>So, how are these two? As I said, they&#39;re intended to be the first partners that I make missions with, so I&#39;d like to hear as much advice about them as possible.<br><br>-Twistey</p>

            <p>...then I realized my computer time was running out, so I decided to just post those two characters and then maybe follow up with Amber&#39;s siblings, who I&#39;d introduce after that.<br><br>What do you mean by &quot;how they work&quot;? Do you mean the mechanics and world-building of why those powers exist, or do you mean their exact abilities? I definitely have the latter down pat (with help from the uber-specific Superpower Wiki), but I haven&#39;t figured out the former yet. You see, Amber, her siblings, and Miriam all are revamped versions of characters  from original worlds that an RP group that I was in created. We never really explained anything, especially not why the government wanted to experiment on people (at least one of our writers was freaking paranoid, that was why) or why all of our characters dressed like they were in a high fantasy or anime story when the real genre was urban fantasy. (They were high fantasy geeks and I was a weeb, that&#39;s why.) So I didn&#39;t really put thought into why Amber and Miriam have their powers, because those were the powers that Sakura/&quot;Mountaineer&quot; and Miriam had.<br><br>Anyway, I&#39;ll send you the other two in the Callahan trio soon.<br><br>-Twistey</p>

<li>It might take a while for that to come about. Maybe it&#39;ll be revealed within the missions themselves.<br><br>2. Bahaha! You&#39;re so right! But the high fantasy didn&#39;t stop there. They used medieval weapons (the big favorite being bows and arrows) that would be very inefficient were they not able to handwave it off with magic. Some of their backstories were kind of high fantasy. They also had bonded wolf companions. Three of them, the most wolf-obsessed ones, had a freakin&#39; ton of wolves each. I was smarter, so I only had two. Yay me.<br><br>-Twistey</li>

            <p>Name: Skater (pseudonym)<br>Age: ~15 or 16. He&#39;s not telling.<br>Home continuum: World One<br>Appearance: White teen with messy blonde hair who perpetually wears sunglasses because they look cool. He also has dog ears attached to his head that match his hair (see History).<br>Personality: Skater is quite absent-minded. Paying attention to something important that he isn&#39;t interested in is difficult, and he is easily distracted and prefers to busy his mind with some daydream. Skater also often forgets himself and many things that he needs to do, ranging from reporting a broken Disguise Generator to forgetting to pack Bleeprin. Skater likes to absorb himself in something he really likes to do and is annoyed when he is interrupted while doing that thing. He can get worked up and begin to stress out over small things if given a chance and a lack of sleep. He tends to monologue to anyone who is willing to listen. He does not have social skills and can say things that would be misinterpreted by others, or misinterpret others&#39; words. He is somewhat literal-minded, feeling the need to explain every joke away, and has a hard time judging the intentions of others. He tries too hard to solve a problem himself and avoids asking for help. While he is kind with a very strong sense of justice, striking up a conversation with him will eventually lead to him saying something that sounds rude or judgmental without even meaning it. He comes down hard on himself all too easily, which can lead to some pretty angsty scenes, and it&#39;s up to his partner to show him that it&#39;s not the end of the world. He has a low tolerance for teasing and a lower tolerance for being called a furry. <br>History: Skater arrived at the PPC through plothole, like many others. During his training, he volunteered for an experiment devised by the Department of Analytical Science to be infused with energy harvested from plotholes, thinking that he would get superpowers. This turned out to be an unfortunate case of Wrong Genre Savvy as his body could not contain the energy and it leaked out a lot, wreaking utter havoc on his psyche and transforming him into an alter ego known as the Phoenix. During his Phoenix phase, he was vulnerable to ego explosions, being a hot-blooded anime protagonist, and completely breaking down because something reminded him of his time as a Suethor. He was partnered with Kuro in the DMS, but after two successful missions and a failed third one, it was clear his state had gotten worse and he was unfit to be an agent anymore. After a long time in FicPsych and then an insane asylum, his condition had mostly improved and he returned to the PPC, where he joined the Department of Floaters. However, when he returned, he was in for a very big surprise.<br>Abilities: He likes wielding a battle axe, but can function with other weapons. Also, what little power he retained from the experiment allows him to kill non-canons that shouldn&#39;t be able to die, basically bypassing immortality.<br>IMPORTANT: Don&#39;t get Skater started on fictional deities. Please don&#39;t.</p>

No matter what, stress doesn&#39;t affect his ability to perform. He is one of those people born with a rare gift for words, able to convince anyone of anything. When problems arise, his first reaction is to calmly analyze the situation and come up with a plan. He is flexible and understanding. Under the strain of badfic, however, he loses his cool just like everybody else. <br>He is quite protective of and caring toward Skater, understanding all his little issues and differences and helping him to put things in perspective. He also helps Skater to be on time. However, under the strain of badfic, Skater just absolutely drives him up the wall, and even under normal circumstances he can be annoyed. Do not be fooled, though: They are fiercely protective of each other. Leo tends to express this by, for example, opening windows of graphically NSFB content on the consoles of people who try to provoke Skater. Skater is secretly jealous of Leo&#39;s social eloquence, but he&#39;s grateful for it.<br>Leo also has this little quirk where he suddenly and for no apparent reason falls in love with a Mary Sue. A quick dose of Anti-Lustin immediately undoes this, as it is not really love, but shallow Suefluence exploiting his vulnerability.<br>Well, I am out of space: See a later post for his history, abilities, and RC.</p>

            <p>History: Leo was first imagined as an idea in someone&#39;s head, in a Massive Multiplayer Crossover set on an island called Ultra Island. Leo remembers no details other than it involved &quot;more than a few Suvians&quot; and was never published. From there, that someone attempted to recycle Leo (and a few other characters) a few times. Again, Leo doesn&#39;t remember the details. He was encountered as a semi-fic blip on a mission, just standing there, a blank slate. He was recruited, the baseline for a personality laid out, and allowed to develop. He started out in the DBS, partnered with someone who was &quot;remarkably intelligent,&quot; but his partner retired after they tackled a Harry Potter Bleepfic and they both had spells with some... mature effects fired at them. Leo&#39;s reflexes allowed him to dodge it, but his partner wasn;t so lucky and had to retire because of the trauma. Leo transferred to the DF and was partnered with a returning veteran, Skater. They immediately recognized each other, which was quite a strange experience for Leo, and Leo learned that he wasn&#39;t just a semi-fic blip; He was Skater’s semi-fic blip! The two have been inseparable ever since.<br>Abilities: Because of Skater’s constant recycling of Leo, he doesn’t play by the boring, cool-fight-scene-unfriendly rules of his home continuum. Being a Tiger’s Eye Dragon, Leo has amazing reflexes, able to dodge things easily and anticipate the enemy’s moves to a degree, and when under lots of pressure… think the Ultra Instinct Shaggy video. He can also utilize a system devised by Skater based on the elemental categorization system in Dragon Story: Leo can use magic derived from all the “elements” of a Tiger’s Eye Dragon. To be more specific, since Tiger’s Eye Dragons are Gemstone/Yellow/Black hybrids, Leo can use all 3 of those elements. <br>• Gemstone Magic lets him fire blasts of energy from his hands and channel some power from people or things he’s in direct contact with to modify and strengthen those blasts. For example, touching Skater will let his blasts bypass immortality, being in contact with a Fire Dragon will let him shoot fire, and holding a source of canon will let him exorcise Sue-Wraiths from canon characters. Easily his most practiced element.<br>Yellow Magic lets him airbend to a degree. (This is his most underdeveloped element, the best he can do is permeate the room with a cooling breeze.)<br>Black Magic lets him use the power of the night and darkness to cloak himself in darkness and obscure himself from Sues, as well as do stuff generally associated with “evil” like conjuring black phantoms and smoke and putting curses on other people. (In practice, he cannot actually curse people. He can summon phantoms, but these have no purpose other than a diversion as they are not very strong. Invisibility is pretty useful in Suefics, though.)<br>Leo can also fly. It’s pretty difficult and he can only manage it for short periods of time provided he’s not carrying a Sue’s body to the Hotland lava pool or something.</p>

<li>Please make him bump into things a lot because he constantly wears sunglasses. It would be so humorous. X)<br><br>2. I see a lot of flaws in the personality. I do kinda get the implied strengths (because I can relate to the flaws and thus I sorta mentally superimposed my own strengths onto him - bad Twistey, bad), but can you go a little further into them so that we have a better idea of what he&#39;s like?<br><br>3. The &quot;they were experimented on that&#39;s why&quot; thing is kind of a cliche, but you seem to have pulled it off with how the experiment ended. I almost was about to warn you about giving the alter ego a cool name, but then I realized that the name was self-given due to said ego explosions. I also don&#39;t see how the dog ears relate to the effects of the experiment - it seems like they were kind of tacked on as a means of achieving the appearance you want your avatar to have. Maybe either come up with a different explanation for the dog ears (keeping the backstory, that&#39;s cool) or scrap them altogether.<br><br>-Twistey<br>P.S. The dog ears thing reminded me of this bit from a Springhole.net article that deals with tacked-on drawbacks/effects. I could probably find something better for this situation, but nonetheless, check this out:<br><a href="http://springhole.net/writing/pointlessly-edgy-tropes-to-reconsider.htm#pointless-drawbacks"><a href="http://springhole.net/writing/pointlessly-edgy-tropes-to-reconsider.htm#pointless-drawbacks">http://springhole.net/writing/pointlessly-edgy-tropes-to-reconsider.htm#pointless-drawbacks</a></a></li>

<li>I was going to do that anyway, but it would stem from his personality rather than his eyewear. I guess I forgot to write that out.<br><br>2. Which implied strengths? Can you please be a little more clear? (See, he is a blatant self-insert!)<br><br>3. Awww, thanks! Anyway, originally I was going to have the after-effects of the experiment be just getting his power, but I see now how I can make these after-effects continue in some way long after he stopped needing treatment for Suethor flashbacks and being the Phoenix. I can still have him do some ego-fueled stupid thing right at the critical moment, like trying to kill an incorporeal manifestation of evil with an axe and mess everything up.

            <p>Name:  Azoralth, once known to his comrades as the &quot;Soul-Tracker&quot;<br>Age: Uncertain<br>Species: Stormcast Eternal, formerly human.<br>Department: DoMS? Haven&#39;t decided yet.<br>Description:<br><br>One of Sigmar&#39;s own Stormcast Eternals, hailing from the Warhammer: Age of Sigmar setting.  Like all Stormcast, he was once a faithful mortal warrior, plucked from the jaws of death by the God-King Sigmar and reforged via lightning and arcane magic into an immortal warrior.  In his past life, he was a youth named Azoralth, a child of two reclusive mages of the Amethyst lore--the lore of Death Magic. (Not to be confused with the Lore of Undeath, which is necromancy.) His parents were also refugees; two of the few survivors of the Age of Chaos wherein the forces of the Chaos Gods ravaged the realms.. <br> Before he was born, they had fled to Ghur, the Realm of Beasts, from the underworlds of Shyish, the Realm of Death. He was raised in almost total isolation, hidden away in a foreboding mountain range, and they taught him the basics of harnessing his latent magical talent for benevolent purposes and self-defense.<br>At sixteen summers of age, however, his world changed forever with the loss of his parents to a marauding warband of Orruks.  His parents had predicted their attack on a nearby village, and presumably gave their lives protecting the village with their sorcery.  When he realized they weren&#39;t coming back (they had left him alone with a black-bladed dagger and some supplies) he set out to follow their last instructions to him, left in the form of a note:  &quot;Find a Realmgate to Azyr [The Celestial Realm.]  The Gates are open; seek out the God-King Sigmar for asylum in his halls.&quot;<br>Thus, he set off across the realms, on an adventure that would see him eventually becoming the leader of a rag-tag band of young refugees and strays of various Realms and species, on a quest to find a gate to Azyr.  ALong the way, however, they were pursued by various forces of the Undead, sent by the necromantic followers of the jealous Lord of Undeath, Nagash. This culminated in an act of desperate self-sacrifice in which Azoralth fully unlocked his magical potential and challenged one of Nagash&#39;s vampire lords to a duel. The vampire, by nature unable to back down from a fight, even one so one-sided as this, accepted his challenge.  Soon after, Azoralth gave up his life, buying his friends and companions time to flee to Azyr.  Azoralth lay there dying as the vampire loomed over him, his friends&#39; names upon his breath.  However, before the vampire could inflict the curse of vampirism upon him, lightning struck down from the heavens, obliterating the creature.  When the blinding light had faded, Azoralth was nowhere to be found...<br>An unspecified amount of time later, he had been reforged by the God-King, who had seen his valor and saved him from a fate worse than death.  Now he was able to once again turn his magical prowess to a righteous cause, combined with the holy power of Sigmar&#39;s lightning as he took up the mantle of a Lord-Relictor--a warrior-priest charged with the protection of the very souls of his fellow Stormcast.  Eventually, as his former companions died, one by one, they, too, were reforged to fight at his side as warriors of a Stormhost known as the Knights Revenant--a host of Stormcast tasked with seeking out, recovering, and maintaining knowledge and artifacts thought lost to history.  He was no exception, and to this day he carries the same journal that he kept on his original journey to Azyr.<br><br>In the PPC-verse:<br>Once again taken up into a realm he had hardly dreamed of, he chooses to remain here due to the mission of his Stormhost in his home verse--the mission to preserve knowledge, and uncover hidden truths, the only difference being that it is now done on a multiversal scale, and instead of only fighting the foes of his home canon, in the name of Sigmar, he fights enemies of all sorts, in the name of upholding the balance of the multiverse.  A part of him misses his comrades, but he has mostly accepted the burden of losing them as being for the greater good of existence as a whole.<br>Abilities and Weapons:<br>--His favored weapon, is, naturally, a relic hammer forged of the same metal as his armor--holy star-forged sigmarite, his other weapon being the black-bladed dagger his parents had left for him in his mortal life.<br>--He retains control over the Amethyst wind of magic, including the ability to literally see other beings&#39; souls and interact with the deceased via physical contact with their remains.  The holy powers bequeathed to him by his Reforging also remain usable, channeled through the reliquary staff he bears and manifesting in the form of holy lightning.</p>

            <p>Well, either way, here’s my first agent:<br><br>Name: Edward Stone (formerly Edward Eagle, but he changed it because he was being teased)<br><br>Age: 20 (ish)<br><br>Species: Peculiar male<br><br>Department: DoMS, Harry Potter division<br><br>Edward is tall with dark hair and his favourite thing to do is wind his sister up. He can control water, but very rarely does because there’s not much water in HQ and it doesn’t work when he’s disguised. He lives on chocolate and coffee and is completely anti-social. In fact, with the exception of Kat, he hates people and likes to be as secretive as possible.<br><br>History: Along with his sister, he started life as an OC in an (imaginary) Miss Peregrine’s Home For Peculiar Children badfic, in which his sole purpose was to turn evil because the Sue ditched him for her LO. Since being rescued by the PPC he’s been working with his sister Kat in the DoMS.<br><br>Powers: As mentioned, water control. His favourite method of killing is Avada Kedavra.<br></p>

            <p>Gonna be honest, it doesn&#39;t really feel like Edward has enough characterization. His favorite thing to do is merely teasing his sister? Then again, perhaps there&#39;s a ton of characterization hiding behind his secretiveness...<br><br>However, the biggest problem I have is with the Powers section. The &quot;His favorite method of killing is Avada Kedavra&quot; bit really rubs me the wrong way- mostly because it reeks of trivialization. The Killing Curse is one of the three Unforgivable Curses- it&#39;s <i>not</i> something to be wielded like a gun or a sword. Heck, the <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Unforgivable_Curses">wiki itself</a> says that just throwing out Unforgivable Curses like nothing without Serious Consequences coming your way is a serious charge, and when it&#39;s something that can be pinned as a serious charge against a Sue, you do <i>not</i> want your agents doing it. (Not to mention, <i>Miss Peregrine&#39;s Home for Peculiar Children</i> is <i>not</i> part of the Potterverse, and thus, Edward shouldn&#39;t be able to use Potterverse spells without a Muggle-use Wand, which don&#39;t tend to come pre-loaded with Unforgivable Curses.)</p>

            <p>You’re definitely right about Avada Kedavra. Trivialising the Unforgivable Curses is a bit of a bad habit of mine.<br><br>As for the characterisation...

            <p>That’s what I tried<sup>(*)</sup>  to do: Use every no-permission-required opportunity to write my agents and get helpful feedback from the Board, then distill the character sheets from the stories. The trick is keeping them consistent or showing same character development through stories set in different points of their timeline, or knowing which stories that have been fun to write must be dismissed as uncanonical to get a consistent character sheet. (This doesn’t mean that these stories shouldn’t have been written in the first place; I learnt a lot about my agents and how not to write them by writing parodies of them for the badfic games.) Also, knowing how a character’s experiences formed their personality is more important to me than having a detailed physical description and a complete list of abilities.<br><br>I know of at least one other Permission Giver who would read your Permission Prompts first and only then look into your character sheets to check whether they fit or at least don’t contradict what is shown in the prompts, and what other <i>important</i> information is there. We actually don’t need to know every small detail about your prospective agents; we just need to know that they’ll fit in and that we can trust you that you won’t make them overpowered suvians after getting Permission. <br><br>Tl;dr: Working from detailed pre-defined character sheets may help many authors to keep their characters consistent, but it’s not an actual requirement for everybody.<br><br><sup>(*)</sup>  I <i>tried</i>, because after three years of writing my non-permissioned agents and doing other stuff on the Board, some Permission Givers just <i>wanted</i> to give me Permission and didn’t even ask for character sheets. (Apparently, Permission came to me with writer’s block, because now I’m responsible to <i>do it right</i> and write stuff that’s worthy of the PPC. After two more years, my agents still don’t have any canonical stories or character sheets / agent pages on the Wiki.)<br><br>HG </p>

            <p>I don&#39;t have Permission, so I decided I&#39;d shoot my two ideas for agents over- the first of which should be *fairly* familiar for those who were around when I was Anonymouse, although (especially in the History bit) he also takes inspiration from another character of mine, that was... also a Porygon-Z.<br><br>Technician/Agent Zeta<br><br>Full Name: Porygon-Z<br>--Full <i>Nickname</i>: PGZProject-423-Zeta<br>Species: Porygon-Z<br>Age: Indeterminate<br>--Mental age: Mid-20s<br>Gender: None<br>--Mental Gender: Male<br>Home Continuum: Pokémon, circa early Generation 7<br>Affiliation: PPC, DOSAT, Department of Floaters (he tends to shuttle between the two departments quite regularly)<br><br>Appearance: Zeta is a <a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Porygon-Z_(Pok%C3%A9mon)">Porygon-Z</a>, a Pokemon made entirely out of computer code, made manifest in the physical world as a collection of simple 3D shapes that combine together to form a sort of floating... duck... robot... <i>thing.</i> In addition, Zeta himself has been heavily modified by DOSAT, denoted by the flash patch emblazoned on his back, which can easily show any emblem- although it&#39;s most likely to show either the DOSAT smoking swivel chair, or the Floaters waterlily.<br>--Human disguise: Zeta manifests as a short, redheaded American man with pale skin and a pair of glasses framing a set of amber eyes. In a modern setting, his clothing typically ends up being a set of blue jeans, a blue shirt, and a red bomber jacket, typically worn unzipped.<br><br>Abilities: Zeta comes pre-loaded with the moves Conversion, Lock-On, Shadow Ball, and Ice Beam, and he also typically keeps the TMs for Ice Beam, Shadow Ball, and Thunderbolt in his personal bag of holding- that way, he can easily swap one of his two attacking moves for Thunderbolt when he needs to. As a Porygon-Z, he has the quite interesting ability to slip into and out of technology, allowing him to do everything from troubleshoot consoles from the inside, to mail himself by ICEP instead of dealing with the labyrinthine corridors of HQ. In addition, the built-in flash patch wasn&#39;t the only modification DOSAT made- he has multiple PPC gadgets built-in as subroutines he can call up, including the Universal Translator (which serves as a sort of backup- he typically communicates via text-to-speech), an RA, the D.O.R.K.S., and most worryingly, a C-CAD- along with *all* of those gadgets&#39; drawbacks. Needless to say, he rarely uses the actual subroutines if he can help it- after all, one ends up quite a bit more protective of their C-CAD when they *are* their C-CAD.<br><br>Personality: Zeta is a take-charge, no-nonsense kind of guy, and is surprisingly quick to irritate- one of his pet peeves being the abuse and/or neglect of any technology, especially fellow AIs. He&#39;s short and to the point, rarely wanting to do anything beyond the Duty itself in a Word-World. That being said, he has a soft spot for bits victimized by the Suethor- and anything sufficiently high-tech enough can quickly become something akin to a lust object for the digital duck.<br><br>History: Zeta was born from a months-long RP based around the Pokemon universe, featuring such joys as wildly-out-of-character canons, events, locales, and people that simply ceased to exist or popped out of the ether, and Pokemon abuse and neglect, topped off with GladioN slash. (Yes, the N is capitalized for a reason. Yes, it&#39;s THAT reason.) The Porygon-Z himself was given the backstory of being one of the first Porygon-Zs in existence, created (or, well, evolved) by Team Galactic itself, and tasked with heading into various alternate dimensions- Zeta had ended up somewhere in the Distortion World for a time, and had popped out years later. Fortunately, the RP eventually detonated and fell apart in a hail of drama, and while his Word-World fell apart around him, Zeta fell into the plothole that an entirely new radio station in Virbank had risen from- and landed in the middle of the Department of Sufficiently-Advanced Technology.<br><br><hr> <br><br>Agent Smith<br><br>Full Name: John Smith<br>Species: Human<br>Age: Generic teenager...?<br>--Mental Age: 21<br>Gender: Male<br>Home Continuum: Wizard101<br>Affiliation: PPC, Department of Floaters<br><br>Appearance: John is a medium-height young man with unkempt brown hair and green eyes. His standard outfit usually ends up being comfortable robes in black and yellow, although he also quite often ends up wearing a white-and-purple suit with a jaunty purple top hat. In magic continua, he tends to prefer staves to wands when casting magic- even going as far as to obtain a wand-cane (think &#39;sword-cane but with a wand&#39;) variation of the Muggle-Use Wand for use in the Potterverse. His justification for such is something along the lines of &#39;Lucius Malfoy had a wand-cane, so it&#39;s not like the concept is incompatible with canon- and I&#39;m fairly certain that I can&#39;t simply use my Spell Deck to cast things like Obliviate.&#39;<br><br>In addition, John is typically followed around by his Pet (yes, that&#39;s the actual terminology used by Wizard101, most likely because the target audience might not understand the term &#39;Familiar&#39;), an Epic-level <a href="http://www.wizard101central.com/wiki/Pet:Sister_Cheesiwitz">Sister Cheesiwitz</a> (a humanoid mouse that comes up to knee height, typically bespectacled, clothed in a simple white-and-lavender dress, and equipped with a nondescript green tome) named Lady Phoebe- or simply &#39;Phoebe&#39;, for short.<br><br>Abilities: John is a Storm wizard- he&#39;s typically armed with a Spell Deck containing spells able to summon anything from the simple Thunder Snake to the powerful and terrifying Storm Lord, which produce powerful... if inaccurate... electricity-and-water-based magical attacks- although his ability to actally <i>use</i> these sort of attacks outside of his home continuum is probably nonexistent, save for perhaps the spell Tempest, which merely summons a storm- and either way, it&#39;s probably best he stay away from using abilities that aren&#39;t canon to the continuum he&#39;s in. (He does, however, have a tendency towards magical or energetic attacks, and weaponry of an electrical or aquatic nature.) Phoebe, meanwhile, is more of a healer, using &quot;may-cast&quot; spells like Unicorn and Healing Current- and when she&#39;s outside of her home continuum, she&#39;s frighteningly effective with a first-aid kit. (Also, she wears their Bag of Holding like a backpack.)<br><br>Personality: John is easygoing, laid-back, and quite optimistic- although he&#39;s not naive, and he *knows* about things like Murphy&#39;s Law and the Ironic Overpower. He knows things *can* go wrong- he just tends to hold out hope that they won&#39;t. He&#39;s also quite fond of both sarcasm and wordplay, especially the art of the pun- after all, when you can&#39;t simply wash things away with an actual thunderstorm, a punderstorm tends to be the next best thing. (After all, which would you rather think about- the Sue and her litany of crimes against canon, or the Lords-awful puns either made by the agent next to you, or coming out of your own mouth?) Phoebe, meanwhile, is a mouse of few words- or, rather, she&#39;s completely mute. She instead gets across her meaning through body language and expression- and when that fails her, she&#39;s not above breaking out the charades or (as a last resort) writing notes on the back of a charge list. She tends to strike a middle ground between Zeta and John, and her caring nature means she ends up being a sort of &#39;team mom&#39; for the duo. While she&#39;s not technically an agent in her own right (heck, even in the canon, Pets are mechanically nothing more than mere inventory items that can be bred, trained, and whatnot, despite often being miniatures of everything from often-hostile beasts, to other sapient races, to mythological creatures like the Forest Lord itself), she downright insists on coming along to every mission, where she jots down charge lists, helps to chase down Minis, and breaks out the first-aid kit when necessary.<br><br>History: John and Phoebe started out as his author&#39;s player character (and... well, an inventory item owned by said player character) from the <i>Wizard101</i> MMORPG, a Level 50-or-so Storm Wizard who hadn&#39;t yet defeated Malistaire. Unfortunately, while preparing to face off against him, he took a wrong turn at the World Gate and ended up in the middle of the PPC. Most of John himself seems to be an author-insert, but he doesn&#39;t seem to be complaining about that...</p>

            <p>Name: Kuro (real name unknown)<br>Age: 31<br>Species: Human male<br>Appearance: He is a medium-height white man who wears jeans and a simple gray sweater. He has a tangled, spiky mess of jet-black hair that he can never straighten out completely. He has green eyes. He usually wears a belt sporting a katana in case he needs to threaten any agent who disagrees with him on something he feels strongly about.<br>Personality: Kuro is a Stereotype Flip of weeaboos. On one hand, he likes anime, manga, and anything that comes out of Japan or is based on material from there. He is a social loser and a high school dropout who is hilariously bad at flirting and has multiple waifus. He has quite an ego and talks about how he is &quot;the master of the blade&quot; and whines about how &quot;girls simply have no taste anymore.&quot; On the other hand, he genuinely works hard and tries to improve constantly, he tries his hardest to be polite and not creepy (to no avail), is a really nice person when you get to know him, and is physically fit enough to complete missions. He can also be quite cool when he over-dramatizes the killing of a Sue. Kuro likes to come up with new methods of exorcism, including the Exorcism Jutsu.<br>History: Kuro did try hard in school. He really did. It&#39;s just that getting held back once in eighth grade, twice in ninth grade, and a whopping four times in tenth grade, even when you&#39;re trying your hardest to understand the material, just breaks you after a while. He eventually gave up and set his sights on a job that got him enough money and time to live and pursue his burgeoning passion for anime. Eventually, he fell into a plothole and discovered the PPC.<br>He started his career at the DMS. After a sufficiently long period of time, his partner retired, and he was partnered with a newbie who called himself &quot;the Phoenix&quot; or just &quot;Phoenix&quot;. The first fic they took on was Kuro&#39;s own self-insert Naruto fic, which they disposed of in the most dramatic way possible. After &quot;Phoenix&quot; became completely incapable of functioning after just two missions and was placed in an asylum, Kuro was partnered with... well, I haven&#39;t though about that part yet.<br>Powers: Kuro has enough physical abilities to pass off as a Narutoverse ninja, until you ask him to use jutsu. He is very skilled in wielding &quot;Weeb weapons&quot; (shurikens and katanas), but can adapt to a wide variety of weapons. Just don&#39;t hand him a gun or other ranged weapon. His weapon is a katana harvested from his self-insert Stu that also allows him to use canonical jutsu. <br>Department: DMS</p>

            <p>First and foremost: Is this character supposed to be really icky, what with the whole &quot;Nice Guy&quot; thing? Because I see you acknowledging that he is creepy, is a whiner, has an oversized ego, and is a loser, but I also see you saying he really tries his best and is actually a nice person if you get to know him. That&#39;s the classic &quot;Nice Guy&quot; excuse for blaming all their ills on the women who are rightly put off by their creepiness instead of taking responsibility for their own flaws.<br><br>So, is the intention to write a character who&#39;s like that, but will be called out on it and (hopefully) improve over time? Or, what is the intent? In other words, why do you want to write this character?<br><br>Also, physical ability aside, how does a guy who struggled so badly with schoolwork and is just scraping together enough money to live on become &quot;very skilled&quot; at wielding a sword? Especially a katana, since Eastern philosophy typically places as much emphasis on the mind and spirit as the body—and no decent instructor would ever condone their student drawing a sword on someone just to make a point, which is also really horrible. Returning to the point, though: How did he afford lessons? Why was he able to succeed at that but nothing else? I think a simple explanation could fix the cognitive dissonance here, but it does need an explanation.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Well, about your first criticism: He does try, he just has literally no idea how to do so. If anyone were to show him love (other than his family), he&#39;d be so grateful that he&#39;d immediately dump all his waifus (they&#39;re off-limits, anyway) and stay with that person forever, never even dreaming of leaving them or hurting them. He&#39;d repay them one hundredfold in his own way. (Unless that person is Luxury. Not even he&#39;s that desperate.) While the whole character development thing wasn&#39;t my original intent, it&#39;s absolutely perfect, especially given his partner&#39;s personality. And he doesn&#39;t even realize his flaws are the problem, which is why it takes a ten-year-old going nuclear on him to open his eyes.<br><br>About the katana training: That was during his training at the PPC. Most agents are skilled at wielding swords, so it makes sense. And the schoolwork thing... not everyone has the chops for trigonometry or chemistry. It&#39;s just really not his thing.</p>

            <p>... that putting all the responsibility on a girl (or boy, or other-gendered person) to make him change is one of the character&#39;s flaws, and it&#39;s a big one.<br><br>For the record, I absolutely believe that everyone deserves a fair shot at love regardless of non-chosen attributes like appearance, and loving and being loved can certainly have a major impact on your life, but it&#39;s not a magical cure for someone who&#39;s spent thirty years thusfar without a clue how not to act like a creep. The responsibility lies with the individual to fix their own behavior problems. Shoving it off on someone else ain&#39;t right. And it&#39;s a major issue in society (see: so-called &quot;incels&quot;), so please forgive me if I seem to be taking this fictional character concept that hasn&#39;t even been written yet too seriously. It&#39;s just that you&#39;re kinda playing with fire here, and I wanna be sure nobody gets burned. {= )<br><br>[Citation needed] on &quot;most agents are skilled at wielding swords.&quot; Where do you find that to be the case? I&#39;d say that, even if Kuro was lucky enough to find himself an agent trainer, sword instruction would only cover the basics of &quot;how not to cut off your own arm.&quot; Certainly not nearly enough to pass as a katana expert if he just started learning in his thirties.<br><br>And ehhhh, getting held back a total of <i>seven times</i> and then dropping out of high school suggests to me that he either blew it off (and therefore wasn&#39;t really trying his best) or may be seriously mentally impaired and/or have other serious issues (if he really was). See, schools don&#39;t like to hold kids back if they can possibly avoid it, because it hurts their performance values. Having issues in just one or two subjects wouldn&#39;t do it. The problems would have to be very serious for them to do it multiple times. Anyway, trig and chem aren&#39;t even options in eighth and ninth grade, unless things have changed a whole lot since I was in school. You have to be able to manage basic math and general science first.<br><br>TL;DR: Much more thought needs to be put into this one to be sure his story makes sense and that he has a redeeming quality or two (that also make sense). As it stands now, I would not want to read about this character as an agent.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Yes, Kuro is from World One, so I am going to reconsider those physical abilities.

            <p>The whole &quot;wakizashi are stealthier weapons&quot; thing is a bit of a false premise.

            <p>I think that you don&#39;t need the extra reach of a katana to assassinate someone, and it would be less practical to carry a longer sword. PPC agents seem to do a lot of waiting, hiding, and other such activities unfriendly to bearers of large objects.</p>

            <p>while it is true that the extra reach is not necessary for a stealth kill, but it is certainly practical to have in case things go south. I also aware of the impracticality of large weapons in a stealth situation, but the katana isn&#39;t exactly a large weapon; the blade is usually from 60 to 73 cm long depending on time period (some are longer, it really depends on the user). If one includes the hilt, they come in at about 90 to 110 cm, which translates to about 35.43 to 43.3 inches. That is shorter than most recurve bows iirc, and recurve bows are manageable in a stealth situation. You might be confusing a katana for a tachi or nodachi perhaps? </p>

            <p>Not quite true, the katana on it&#39;s own isn&#39;t a symbol of the Samurai class, the daishō was. The daishō (big-small) refers to a daito (longsword) and shōto (shortsword) pair. Usually this is a katana and wakizashi pair forged as sister swords, and wearing it was a symbol of office and thus was illegal for anyone other than a samurai to wear the daishō.<br><br>In any case, since the abolishment of the samurai class, anyone can use a katana, even foreigners. Actually, many people do own and can use a katana if they practice kenjutsu, and is sort of a requirement for tameshigiri (one needs a shinken to make the cuts). Although, the katana used were probably forged in China instead of Japan because of sword manufacturing restrictions. (kind of ironic if you ask me, but makes sense given the overlap between Chinese and Japanese weaponry)</p>

He uses Draconian expressions in his speech, such as the greeting “Bast Chauble” and the philosophical concept of going “even more unto Yark.”<br><br>Appearance: Gibbs is a seven foot tall reptilian humanoid with a hunched posture, dark green scales, and a nice set of fangs. He is rarely seen without his stetson, and his eyes hold a look of steely determination that took him years to perfect.<br><br>History: Gibbs spent many years working as a security guard in Dulce base, a joint human-draconian military base located under Archuleta Mesa. He held himself to a very high standard, and soon became known as one of the most capable officers on the security team. With this good mixture of skill and expendability, Gibbs was an ideal candidate to send on a test jaunt through the base’s new portal. He came unstuck in space and time, and learned of Sues, or, as he called them, reality-warping entities. When we meet him, he has several unlicensed Sue killings under his belt, and has consequently attracted the attention of the PPC.</p>

            <p>Agent Brandon:<br>NAME: Brandon<br>AGE: 10<br>SPECIES: Human male<br>HOME CONTINUUM: Pokémon (specifically Alpha Sapphire)<br>APPEARANCE: Brandon looks like the default male Trainer for Pokémon Alpha Sapphire<br>PERSONALITY: Brandon is sort of like Ash. He&#39;s an All-Loving Hero who&#39;s always raring to press on with his &quot;adventure,&quot; whether it be a Pokémon journey or a mission. He wonders about everything and likes to try new things, like scanning fanart with a CAD or different methods of exorcism. He loves learning about the world around him and enjoys knowing things. He strongly believes that anyone can become stronger and better if they try, and is usually the one to advocate for recruiting non-disruptive Sues. He can often be found in a state of awe at something he just witnessed, like a kid going &quot;That. Was. AWESOME!&quot; He is quite naïve and prior to joining the PPC did not know that most of the things in badfic were even possible. Please forgive him if he bluescreens for a moment in a particularly bad badfic. He possesses a journal, an artifact from his home continuum.<br>His partner Pokémon, Swampert, is pretty casual and coolheaded. He is arguably the brains of the duo, capable of coming up with intricate plans to take down Sues.<br>HISTORY: Brandon was the protagonist of an Alpha Sapphire cartridge belonging to someone who did not bother with character naming or customization. Or maybe he did and Brandon just reverted to the default after entering the PPC. He really doesn&#39;t know. His cartridge was thrown away and crushed in a dumpster, and the ensuing data corruption created a plothole that allowed him to escape with the six Pokémon he had and his journal to the PPC.<br>Soon after he reached the PPC, he and his Pokémon were carted off to Medical for an emergency operation to treat the corruption. Only he and his starter Pokémon, a male Swampert, survived. The others were glitchy messes that eventually resolved into piles of gore. Brandon was heartbroken at his loss, but with the help of Marshtomp, he was able to emotionally recover, and they vowed to live well to make his survival count. After being trained, he and Swampert transferred to the DMS and were partnered with an agent referring to himself as the Phoenix. After two missions, the Phoenix became completely mentally insane, and was sent to an insane asylum for his health. Brandon was paired with Kuro instead.<br>POWERS AND ABILITIES: Swampert can Mega Evolve, but this has been a painful experience for him ever since he entered the PPC&lt; and Brandon and Swampert prefer to use it as a last resort.</p>

            <p>First off, that... just seems like a near-carbon-copy of Brendan, who... is a canon character. I know that that&#39;s the intention, but... I&#39;m not particularly certain if &quot;Brandon&quot; differentiated himself from Brendan enough to be a separate character from him.<br><br>Second... you said that &quot;Brandon&quot; was borne from a copy of Alpha Sapphire where someone <i>didn&#39;t</i> bother to customize the character or change the name, right? ...Well, ORAS never had character customization, that was something that stayed in Kalos up until it showed up in Alola, and...<br><br>I also think we *might* have a mini-Missingno named &quot;Brandon&quot; we need to catch...</p>

            <p>I&#39;m Twistey, a 1-year-bie who has a lot of ideas, a lot of fandoms, and an addiction to electro music, throwing Fangirl German into my sentences, and anything that lights up. (It&#39;s a long story.) Wow... I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever summarized myself in one sentence before. Well then, moving on.<br><br>So, Jellyity, what about you? How&#39;d you come here? What fandoms are you a part of? And, most importantly, what do you intend to do here? I&#39;m decent at critiquing short bios, so if you wish to contribute to the agent idea thread, do so! I&#39;d also like to know if you animate or program (whether games or mods), since I&#39;m thinking of proposing an expansion of sporkable material into both video and fangame territory, using missions in the same format.<br><br>And for your newbie gift, let&#39;s see. [Hands you a hand-sized device that looks like a geometric, metal flower bud.] Don&#39;t push that little button on the side of it it unless you&#39;re ready to give up your humanity, and in that case, point it at yourself. }:D<br><br>Nice to meet you!

            <p>This is a thread for playing Charge the Sue, a game I just made up!</p>

<p>To begin a game of Charge the Sue, someone must reply to this thread by saying something along the lines of "<em>Name of hypothetical Sue</em>, you are charged with the following:". Anyone who participates in that specific Sue's game can reply to that post by listing exactly one charge. It can be anything from "Being a Mary Sue" to something completely exotic and unlikely to be seen on any charge list. You cannot post twice in a row on the same game, but you can post in multiple games and you can post more than once in a game as long as the posts are not consecutive. Please do not consider already-added charges in your post, because we want to have some fun with this. In fact, try to make the charge lists silly, incoherent, and hilarious to your heart's content!</p>

<p>After a charge list has become long enough, any agent can close the thread by providing the final charge and choosing to sentence the Sue to death by any sufficiently ironic means.</p>

<p>Please don't specify which agent is doing the charging.</p>

<p>Let us begin!</p>

            <p>The idea behind it would be that the PPC Boarders, for one reason or another, must write their own avatars into battle alongside the agents, in order to complete a variety of adventures. Your agents could know it&#39;s you via something that affects the fact that normally agents don&#39;t know that the Board exists, or you could be keeping up a disguise the whole time so that they don&#39;t find out (which would be an interesting subplot.)<br><br>The game would be a first person RPG (a la <i>Wolfenstein RPG</i> and <i>Doom RPG</i>) that has multiple &quot;campaigns&quot; - different adventures centered around different protagonists and different threats. For instance, I have planned three of my own campaigns where your mission is to stop a rabid badficcer who is attempting to convert the denizens of every multiverse into Suvians of her own design, as well as put an end to both the fictional PPC... and the real one. Those three campaigns, being mostly centered around me, would include my agents and future Badfic Games personas that I create, but if you want to have your own campaign with your own characters, that&#39;s totally fine (and probably necessary - I don&#39;t want to end up having a game about a group I&#39;m in and showcase nothing but my own contributions.) You could even have a campaign centered around a particular PPC character, supported by the characters they&#39;re close to and taking on whatever is after them. The possibilities are numerous.<br><br>So, answering your question in this case, there would be a lot of final bosses. And it would be great that way.<br><br>-Twistey</p>

            <p>But then it becomes Interactive Fiction rather than a Visual Novel. Different genre, ever so slightly. Although the real differences manifest themselves more in Parser IF than in Twine stuff, which derives more from CYOA.<br><br>Not that I&#39;m looking down on IF. Some of my favorite interactive experiences are traditional IF—<i>Midnight. Swordfight</i>, <i>Three-Card Trick</i>, I even have a soft spot for <i>The Lurking Horror</i> and that&#39;s a classic Infocom game—so lots of puzzles that I needed a guide to solve. (Although in retrospect a lot of them did make sense).<br><br>I&#39;m not looking down on Twine either. <i>Birdland</i>, <i>Belle Park, Youth Detective</i>, and <i>KNOWN UNKNOWNS</i> ade a brilliant trilogy, and I loved <i>16 Ways to Kill a Vampire at MacDonalds.</i><br><br>If anything, I&#39;d say the majority of visual novels are poorly designed and frustrating. A lot of them tend to have a nasty problem that if you went wrong it&#39;s hard to know where and you just have to play it all over from the start. Fate is actually great in this respect, because the majority of failures are immediate, and those that aren&#39;t make it kinda obvious what you messed up (typically, not focusing enough on one character and thus not getting them to like you enough for yhem to help you at a crucial moment). Additionally, many VNs offer the ability to fast-forward or skip stuff you&#39;ve already seen, to mitigate the fact that you&#39;ll probably be replaying them a lot. This makes it way less painful. <br><br>But I think it&#39;s telling that my favorite VN is a babby&#39;s-first VN with a single path forward that&#39;s actually a mashup of a VN and a point &#39;n click. That being Phoenix Wright. Which, by the way, you should all play. It&#39;s excellent and a lot of fun and very well-written.</p>

            <p>. . . I don&#39;t know who to say &quot;by,&quot; actually.  It&#39;s an Isaac Asimov novel, but I never realized the novel is an adaptation from an earlier screen play.  So this is a weird example of the film coming <i>before</i> the book—which technically means I&#39;ve broken my &quot;consume the original first&quot; rule, but eh.  Film isn&#39;t really my medium of choice for fiction consumption.<br><br>Spoilers follow for <i>Fantastic Voyage</i>.  There is one major spoilery plot point, so if you&#39;re at all interested in reading it, don&#39;t read any further.<br><br>About a year ago, I went on a completely unnecessary and wasted Jules Verne kick.  (Wasted because apparently the English translations of his stuff are terrible translations, so I may not even have gotten the stories and Verne intended anyway.)  Having a vague idea of the plot of FV due to the many 90s cartoons that ripped off its plot, I was expecting a very whimsical and light-hearted shrinking journey in the name of science!  Boy, was I wrong.  FV actually takes place in a war setting, and opens with the tail end of a rescue mission, followed by an assassination attempt.  Plus, the reason for the shrunken surgery is to get even more shrinking technology from the victim&#39;s head, which would basically have allowed for all-out shrunken warfare.  Having just seen <i>Ant-Man and the Wasp</i>, I couldn&#39;t help but picture an entire battlefield of Ant-Man suits . . . and of course, there&#39;s the espionage aspect, too.<br><br>The novel is showing its age.  The dialogue gets very awkwardly formal is some spots, especially since it must yet take place in our future.  But the biggest sore thumb in that regard is the one female member among the main cast, and how much attention is focused on that.  I&#39;m used to casts that are way more diverse than that without it being commented on . . . yeah, just really dated-feeling.<br><br>All the little details about the human body, and experiencing them on such a small scale, were really cool, despite being in very technical language for the most part.  Especially interesting was the detail of how vision would be distorted when looking with light passing through normal-sized air molecules, but with eyes shrunk down much smaller than usual.  It must have taken the original screenwriters and/or Asimov quite a bit of research!<br><br>I was very pleased at the reveal of who the &quot;traitor&quot; was.  Going by in-text clues, I actually wouldn&#39;t have said there <i>was</i> a traitor on board, but I thought for sure it was Doctor Duval.  The narrative was clearly trying to set up Grant and Peterson as the designated requisite couple, and it would have been sooooo convenient of Duval to turn out to be a bad guy in the end, so Peterson could stop her professional dedication to him.  I was legitimately surprised when it turned out to be Michaels instead.  I also liked that he actually wasn&#39;t a turncoat working for the enemy country, but actually just a pure scientist through-and-through who didn&#39;t want a medical discovery to be weaponized.<br><br>I feel like this was short review, but I need to get to sleep soon.  Tune in next time when I probably read another decades-old novel with no active fandom that only one or two others in this entire community have read anyway.  And everyone, feel free to add reviews of your own recent media-feedings onto this thread as well!<br><br>—doctorlit, late for bed for sure this time<br><br>&quot;They&#39;ve passed through an arterio-venous spoiler, sir.&quot; &quot;They&#39;ve passed through an arterio-venous spoiler, sir.&quot; &quot;They&#39;ve passed through an arterio-venous spoiler, sir.&quot; </p>

I&#39;m also curious about how well the biology stuff holds up. That sort of thing always interests me.<br><br>Also how they explain and/or decline to explain the shrinking, which should really not work, especially if we&#39;re talking a &quot;scale down all your atoms&quot; thing, but also the Ant-Man &quot;remove the space between your atoms&quot; thing.

            <p>It&#39;s not quite in the same tone as the Foundation trilogy (the only other Asimov I&#39;ve read), but it was still a good read.<br><br>For myself, I found the science to be pretty reasonable, although I&#39;m not particularly versed in either molecular physics or microbiology.  (Is that microbiology?)  But the body detail aspects at least jived with what I recall on the subjects from school/<i>Magic School Bus</i>.  And the shrinking . . . there was an explanation, though I forget what it was, and can&#39;t remind myself because I&#39;m at my parents&#39; house at the moment.  I vaguely recall a discussion along the lines of density remaining constant through the volume change which, unlike in <i>Ant-Man</i>, makes the shrunken matter much more fragile, to the point where Brownian motion in the bloodstream becomes physically threatening.  It all felt internally consistent, which is probably most important in a novel like this anyway.<br><br>The medical team did indeed need to shrink a supply of air to bring along, as the members&#39; lungs became too small to process full-size air molecules.<br><br>—doctorlit, without a reference</p>

            <p>Your writing style is, again, so quintessentially PPC-esque, it makes me jealous.

And I like that you&#39;ve made it the &quot;ground floor&quot; rather than some mysterious basement.  It makes it feel to me more like it&#39;s literally just the lowest point in HQ, and the trash all winds up there through random breezes and kicks, coupled with gravity.

            <p>I honestly didn&#39;t even think about what the ground floor was used for before all the trash got in it. I&#39;d <i>imagine</i> it&#39;d have RCs in it. Maybe I&#39;ll leave that for you to fill out, if you write in it, ay? <br>I&#39;ll be waiting! <br><br>Also, I didn&#39;t even think of how dark the situation is, but I guess it&#39;s a bit dark, innit, kidnapping and violence and all? <br>I should pay more attention to things in general! <br>Cheers for the review, anyhow, mate!

            <p>HQ has sub-basements.

            <p>I always figured that the spatial dimensions of HQ were the sort of thing a mortal mind isn&#39;t really meant to try fathoming - that if you measured just how deep the dark stairs going down to the ground floor go, you&#39;d conclude that they&#39;re twenty-five kilometres <i>above</i> the rest of HQ, and fifty leagues west from where you started. And then your measuring device would evaporate in your hand. Or so on. <br>I&#39;m sure it&#39;s sort of... floating around all those other places. <br>Which might all be cop-out excuses, but they&#39;re all pretty fun ones! <br><br>I also figured at least some of the trash there just kinda piled up, flooding out of that little trash dimension in that closet. Probably didn&#39;t make that very clear, though, did I? <br><br>And no worries, it&#39;s not like it&#39;s a particularly intelligent story, either!<br><br>The spooky question is, is where does the ground floor exit out onto, eh?

            <p>I liked how the repatitive-ish descriptions gave a good feeling of the oppressive bleakness of the ground floor. And your characters&#39; interactions were overall funny. (To pick out an example, the &quot;chop your own head off&quot; and the bit with Anne convincing Ninetwo to hit someone over the head were good.)<br><br>The ending confused me initially, but then I cottoned on that the shift decided to hide in the alternate dimension.

            <p>I will always remember running, very early on, into your DoSAT spinoff, and for all its brevity I&#39;ve always felt it was very influential. It turned the PPC&#39;s tech support from one person into a team that could actually be used in stories, and started the journey of Makes-Things from &#39;shy techie who&#39;s scared of everyone&#39; to the figure who came back from the dead in sheer denial. It also started off a trend of far more interesting department names, and I know some of mine were directly inspired by it - nothing as simple as &#39;Department of Mary Sues&#39; here, thank you very much!<br><br>Here&#39;s to fifteen more years.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Or rather, the Union of Plort, history having wrecked my joke before it even got started. :)<br><br><b>What&#39;s a Plort?</b><br><br>The great and noble history of the Protectorate of Plort, Konti-Nyuum, cannot be conveyed in so few words as I have here. Rather, let its full history be told, that you may read it at your leisure:<br><br><a href="https://plort.wikia.com/wiki/The_History_of_Konti-Nyuum">The History of Konti-Nyuum</a><br><br>(AKA the story that started it all, plus links to some of the stuff that&#39;s been added since.)<br><br><b>No, seriously, what&#39;s a Plort?</b><br><br>Ohhh, you want the <i>boring</i> introduction.

If you (any you) tell me what your shield looks like - either in formal heraldic speak, or just a description - I will create it for you.<br><br>And if you also write out the story of your Plort persona, I&#39;ll pop it all on the Cyclopaedia to preserve it for the ages.<br><br>(Heraldry for historical Plort/PPC figures who lack it is also welcome, as is heraldry - Inglish only - for any Marizu you have faced. Those ones are fun. ^_^)<br><br>And if you ask very nicely, there&#39;s always a possibility Scapegrace will pull out all the stops and flag-ify your shield. No promises though. ;)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>&quot;The <a href="https://plort.wikia.com/wiki/Nechsiv">river Nechsiv</a> is a raging river that forms part of La Wunj’s natural defences&quot;  doesn’t sound plausibel. Reasons:<br><br>La Wunj has been listed both as a city in Barony Juliette and in Barony Vixenmage (now Larf). Being a natural border between these baronies, the Nechsiv apparently runs through La Wunj. It may once have been a part of La Wunj’s natural defences before La Wunj expanded across the river. Or it may be a part of La Wunj’s natural defences again, since the cross-river suburbs of La Wunj lay abandoned even if the city’s centre has been repopulated.<br><br>La Wunj appears to be a sea harbour, with ships going up the raging river? Or do ships on the Chaett and Iric Routes only go to the port of <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=315657;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">Landen-zon</a>, at the mouth of the Nechsiv?<br><br>HG</p>

            <p>And I haven&#39;t much to contribute, but mayhaps I could nab a heraldry request? I hesitate to request one for my Inglish coat of arms, as it&#39;s rather complicated and in its ccurrent form somewhat eschews proper blazonry rules.<br><br>My Alvish one, though, should work fine, in large part thanks to only relying on a single symbol, which I have you to thank for. You recall the brass snowflake from the political compass thread? Well, I turned it into my Alvish symbol. If I understood the Alvish system correctly, it should be <i>ner blue, rena silver; canta nastar alta tera, a brass snowflake; canta nastar nica tera, the snowflake&#39;s shorter arms. </i><br><br>Or, if I messed that up horribly, a brass snowflake with four long arms and four shorter ones on a navy blue field with a silver border.<br>I know snowflakes don&#39;t come in fourfold symmetry, but I couldn&#39;t make the six pointed version work with the Alvish rank encoding.<br>I also wanted to do some silver arrows meeting the shorter points, but I couldn&#39;t work that with the ranking either. Plus, it was getting a bit busy.<br>Also not sure about what shade of blue to go for. I&#39;m leaning towards navy, but I dunno how well that works with the brass.<br><br>I&#39;ve got a whole backstory for my Plort self waiting in the wings about my journey from the great Red Wall (too obvious a name for Redwall?) across the sea to Konti-Nyuum, but considering I haven&#39;t even been able to name my Plort self, I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll have that ready any time soon. Ah well, next Plort thread, I suppose.</p>

            <p>It&#39;s perfect! It&#39;s all steampunk and clockwork and vaguely reminiscent of a ship&#39;s wheel which is totally perfect for what I&#39;m planning for my Plort self and you even worked the arrows in and I love it so much! You even got the variant of brass I for the snowflake right even though I forgot to mention it!<br><br>Ahem, sorry for the run-on sentence, but seriously, thank you so much. <br><br>Now, as for my Inglish heraldry, the other reason I was reluctant to ask you for help is because I might end up changing it. A lot. I can feel there&#39;s a way to get it to work with proper blazonry rules if I can just simplify it a bit and change the field.<br>If you really feel like taking a crack at it, though, I&#39;m hardly going to decline after how awesome the Alvish one turned out. I&#39;m not even going to try to properly describe this one, though, so plain English will have to do. Oh, and I also sketched it a bit, if that helps.<br><br>The top of the shield is a dark red, with a silver sword pointing left. The center is divided in two, blue on the right charged with a rampant wolf facing left, yellow on the left charged with a rampant badger facing right. The bottom of the shield is green with a silver bow and arrow crossed.<br><br><a href="https://i.imgur.com/7ZVvWFr.png">The sketch.</a> It&#39;s not much, but it&#39;s the best I&#39;ve got. Don&#39;t feel too constrained by it, though. It&#39;s only a sketch, so feel free to muck about with the particular shades of the colors and whatnot. Stars know I will next time I work on it. <br><br>It is, as you can see, rather a kitchen sink blazon. I&#39;m almost positive there&#39;s a better way to divide up the field, I&#39;m seriously reconsidering the sword and the bow and arrow, and I&#39;m still debating whethet I want the red chief embattled or not.  Really the only part I&#39;m completely happy with is the badger and wolf facing each other, and even then I&#39;m not sure if they should be colored proper or sable and argent.<br><br>Still, I suppose the only way to improve is to iterate. The sooner I do that, the sooner I can find the flaws in the next version. &quot;Fail faster,&quot; I believe the common wisdom goes.<br><br>Thank you again for the Alvish heraldry, and good luck if you end up tackling the other one. You&#39;re the best, hS.<br></p>

            <p>Kinda surprised you managed to work out a rules compliant blazon for it. I&#39;d assumed I&#39;d have to redesign it for that. Never would have thought to do it by dividing an ordinary. Heck, I didn&#39;t even know that was allowed.<br>I actually had the same thought about there being a Base ordinary. Maybe they never created one because the bottom of the shield is easier to obscure? Lower down, smaller area, not exactly prime design real estate. <br><br>Whatever the case, I can&#39;t thank you enough for this, it looks fantastic! I especially like the bow and arrow, that bit came out great.<br><br>The colors came out really nice, too. Sanguine is pretty much dead on for what I was going for. Dunno what it is, but I&#39;ve just never really liked working with regular ol&#39; Gules.<br><br>Though I do have one tiny nitpick, d&#39;ya think you could swap the animals placement? They look great how they are, but the symbolism doesn&#39;t quite work as well with them reversed. Up to you if you want to make the wolf argent, though. I can handle that much if I decide I want it that way.<br><br>Everything else is perfect, though. Thanks again for doing this for me. The badger and wolf on the blazon are pretty firmly beyond my ability to draw digitally, so I wouldn&#39;t have been able to do this myself for a long while. </p>

            <p>...I think it&#39;s time to work with you on cleaning up an old mess. That mess is the Lord of Darkness. I think I have a decent new concept to return the character back to my original motives for creating him (that being a statement on the use of Hitler in the media, instead of just being limited to the Wolfenstein continuum). I wouldn&#39;t say I&#39;m making it more politically correct - rather, I think of it more as an adjustment of that concept to my current, much less pessimistic/paranoid &quot;he&#39;s everywhere and we can&#39;t stop it&quot; viewpoint on the subject.<br><br>I&#39;m not going to edit his wiki article, because I want this new concept approved by you. How does this sound:<br><br>The Lord of Darkness is a powerful warlord who champions the political worldview known as Darknessism and owns various castles across Weab <i>(note: going through with your idea of owning a ton of castles, because it made sense to keep it)</i>. Some of these (such as those in So Shall Medea) are built by followers or pseudo-followers <i>(note: Nazi edgelords)</i> of Darknessism in whatever country the castle is built in; others are built by his own band of nameless helpers, wherever a hero on a crusade against Darknessism is told of <i>(note: perhaps I could word this better? This means places like the Wolf castles and other areas representative of fandoms where placing Hitler into the canon actually makes sense)</i>. Still others are the result of the leader of a nation literally inviting the Lord of Darkness into the nation to redirect public hatred away from the leader or to scare the people into submission. Usually, this doesn&#39;t work, and instead makes the people hate the ruler more, because of how easy it is to tell when the Lord of Darkness doesn&#39;t belong. <i>(note: canons where Hitler gets shoved in because the author is too lazy to come up with an original villain or because ShoCk VALue ThatS whY.)</i> He evidently does dastardly things wherever he goes, but no two nations have the same memories of him <i>(note: meant to be the different interpretations from different fandoms, which is what the &quot;multiple avatars&quot; thing was.) </i> Even though some Marizu are indeed led by followers or pseudo-followers of Darknessism, the general Plortish sentiment is to refrain from going after these Marizu or Darknessism in general, as it&#39;s just not worth it.<br><br>The article would then go on to define Darknessism and pseudo-Darknessism, and then finish with a list of the castles.<br><br>Looking forward to hearing any feedback you have.<br><br>-Twistey</p>

You&#39;re still setting up a thing where Hitler is a constant presence across Weab, which <i>while accurate</i>, isn&#39;t something I feel Plort should have to address.<br><br>Drawing on your &#39;different memories&#39; concept... since Hitler was a <i>spectacularly</i> terrible person, why give him the &#39;honour&#39; of being a major player in Weab? Treat each instance as a separate person, which can be mocked in their own particular ways as and when they become relevant to the PPC. Only when there&#39;s an actual connection (like in the Wolfensteins) are they the same person.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Plort is very much based on the PPC community, rather than the media or world in general. I also can&#39;t say that I would want in the <i>slightest</i> to have an equivalent of him <i>currently alive in the Plort world</i>. Heck, no. Please, no. Add to that that I don&#39;t necessarily want to suddenly have to change Baron Esh&#39;s primary goal from fighting Marizu and wandering and stuff to opposing him, and...yeah.<br><br>(You might say, &quot;Zing, you wouldn&#39;t <i>have</i> to do that, no one&#39;s forcing you&quot;--yeah. Yeah, I would. I really, really, really would. Please don&#39;t insert a nightmare of a genocidal dictator into <i>Plort</i>, especially as <i>not dead and in some power</i>. If anything, he&#39;d have once existed in the history of some of those mysterious lands outside the island from whence came some of Plort&#39;s inhabitants. Any fascism equivalent would likely be <i>there</i>, if anywhere.)<br><br>In short: for the love of God, keep him out of Plort and in the past where he belongs.<br><br>~Z</p>

            <p>Because the pose of an animal charge *is* something you can specify in heraldry. It&#39;s known as the animal&#39;s &#39;attitude&#39;.<br><br>For example, while Huinesoron didn&#39;t specify the attitude of the snow leopard in the blazon, the snow leopard in the arms he presented was a <i>Snow Leopard Sejant Regardant Proper</i>, which translates to &quot;A snow leopard, sitting down (<i>Sejant</i>), looking behind itself (<i>Regardant</i>), colored as a snow leopard would be in real life (<i>Proper</i>).&quot;<br><br><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attitude_(heraldry)">Here&#39;s the Wikipedia article on attitudes in heraldry</a> if you want to look through it.</p>

            <p>It&#39;s just to do with what comprises the boundary between one side and the other: mainly, real time and not real time. For the branches, I was probably thinking of the Eastern and Western hemispheres, since the side of the prime meridian you&#39;re on also plays a part in determining who interacts on the Board and who interacts in chat. By the same token, could additionally refer to Eastern and Western US time zones, or whatever other east-west divide you like.

            <p>Years upon years ago, the young An&#39;onere was readying himself to undergo the trial of Purmeshun, so he might take up the cause of the Knights of Plort.<br><br>However... on the eve upon which he was to set upon the Knight&#39;s Road, he instead... vanished. While it may have been said that he fell victim to simple cowardice, this was simply not the case. No... it was simply that fate had found a different road for the young mage to travel, and bade him travel that road first.<br><br>And so, he left on the back of <i>Mental Haze</i>, in the dead of night. He journeyed to far-off lands to practice the magic of Pro&#39;gramman and Eich-Tee-Ehm-Ehl, he practiced and mastered the art of Arpying, and he finally rescued his friend, once thought lost to the Marizu. Together, they finally rebuilt the town of Tah&#39;vernn, except this time, far from the land of Chatt-zei. Their New Tah&#39;vernn would rise next to a new town that practiced both Arpying and the art of Mons, and both would be connected with the magic of Dizzy Chord keystones.<br><br>It was here, in New Tah&#39;vernn, where he renamed himself. No longer would he be known as An&#39;onere Morysse. Forevermore, he would bear the name of Lunamann- and his heraldry would change to match his new name.<br><br><i>Argent, a quarter Vairy Purpure and Argent, a base dexter pentacle Sable, a chief sinister crescent points dexter Sable, a base sinister Poké Ball Argent with features Gules and outline Sable, a cross Sable with the Roman numeral XIII Vert.</i><br><br>After three long years, the young mage who once entered Plort as Po&#39;kere Trikense, then again as An&#39;onere Morysse, has returned. His spell tome bears a new name as well- it now bears the name <i>Zeta</i>. His steed has vanished- or, perhaps it was simply left behind. Instead, the mage bears a magic staff, known as <i>John Smith</i>. He doesn&#39;t feel ready to seek out Purmeshun again, though, not yet... all in due time.<br><br><hr>
<br><br>Not *entirely* sure if I got the blazon right there, <a href="https://imgur.com/a/kcoKAe6">this</a> is what it&#39;s supposed to look like. And yes, I know full well that normal furs are fixed in coloration- but according to Wikipedia, Vair can be an exception. It <i>can</i> be an alternate set of colors, it&#39;s just that when it is, it&#39;s written as &quot;Vairy&quot; or &quot;Vairé&quot;, instead of just &quot;Vair&quot;. (Potent is the same way, one could easily have &quot;Potenty Or and Gules&quot; or &quot;Potenté Argent and Vert&quot;.)<br><br>Also, Tah&#39;vernn/New Tah&#39;vernn is pretty much just a Chatzy RP room/a Discord RP server that I assembled with a few friends of mine- and the other town, the one that &#39;practiced both Arpying and the art of Mons&#39;, is... well, a Pokemon RP server that I joined a bit before I revived the Chatzy RP room as a Discord server. (And the &#39;once thought lost to the Marizu&#39; is because one of my friends at one point had a blatant Gary Stu for a character. He doesn&#39;t anymore, though, hence why he was saved.)</p>

            <p>Yeah, you were right to keep the flaunches. Wolf 3D is still a big part of me, albeit in a new way. When I got into Lichtspeer, I noticed that it&#39;s basically the opposite of Wolfenstein 3D, and I&#39;ve explored that idea in a few ways with a concept I call &quot;the holy duality.&quot; I find it rather interesting.

            <p>We recently did some updates on the Plort map, and plort setting as a whole.

            <p>In honor of Delta&#39;s 15th Boardaversary, I figured we should bring back one of the oldest PPC games, Fill the Plothole.<br><br>The way this works is that I post a few fanfic titles and summaries that are questionable or maybe just plain weird. Your quest (if you feel like accepting it) is to write something good based in some way off the summary or title. There&#39;s no need to claim summaries, and it&#39;s more than fine if multiple people write based off one fic.<br><br>If you&#39;re not happy with your options, please feel free to post more of them, since I grabbed these by skimming the first few pages of recently updated Harry Potter and LotR fics on AO3 (the LoTR section looked pretty good, but I haven&#39;t read those books in a while).<br><br>So, without further ado:<br><br><i>The Twins Saga-Book one-The Potter Twins</i> (Harry Potter): Series re-write. Harry has a lot more power than he knows about, and a twin he isn&#39;t even aware of. What happens when his life as he knows it is a lie and he can&#39;t even tell? Will he ever find out and be able to right things? His sister is determined to help him do so. He just has to let her in, and learn to trust a Slytherin.<br><br><i>Harry Potter and the Mysterious Mind Reader</i> (Harry Potter): Danni is a student at Hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry. She has always felt a deep hatred for the famous Harry Potter. Then he catches her breaking the rules, and offers her a deal that she can&#39;t refuse. After seeing more sides of the famous figure, she begins to become unsure of her own feelings.<br><br><i>The Star Called Mione G</i> (Harry Potter): Hermione Granger&#39;s secret hobby turns serious when Dumbledore decides to use her as a pawn, a distraction and a weapon in his game of warfare. The famous starlet called Mione G might change the course of the war in many surprising ways.<br><br><i>A second chance</i> (Lord of the RIngs x Harry Potter): what if Mandos decided to save Harry Sirius and Snape while simultaneously saving Middle earth.<br>first fanfic so feedback apreciated<br><br>- Tomash</p>

The famous starlet called Mione G might change the course of the war in many surprising ways.</i><br><br>&quot;Ah, Miss Granger!&quot;<br><br>Hermione jumped as the Headmaster&#39;s voice echoed through the draughty room. &quot;Professor Dumbledore! I can explain.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I&#39;m sure you can.&quot; Dumbledore strolled into the round chamber, showing no sign of weariness at the long climb he had just made. &quot;Where would you like to start?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Er.&quot; Hermione pushed a tangle of hair back from her face. &quot;I&#39;m very sorry-&quot;<br><br>Dumbledore pulled out a scroll and allowed it to unroll; the end dragged on the floor. &quot;I have a whole list of people who will be quite put out with you,&quot; he said amiably. &quot;Professor Sinistra is wondering where her best telescope has gone... Madam Pince is looking for several missing sixth-year Astronomy texts... Mister Filch is convinced there&#39;s a student sneaking into the Astronomy Tower... and poor Minerva is bound to be upset that you&#39;re using her Time-Turner for unauthorised purposes.&quot;<br><br>Hermione cringed at each name. &quot;I know, Professor,&quot; she said, &quot;but I really needed to... well...&quot;<br><br>&quot;The stars are endlessly fascinating, aren&#39;t they?&quot; The Headmaster crossed the empty classroom and peeked into the telescope. &quot;You&#39;ve enhanced the magnificiation quite considerably, haven&#39;t you?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I needed to be able to see,&quot; Hermione muttered. &quot;Hence the-&quot;<br><br>&quot;Hence the advanced textbooks, indeed.&quot; Dumbledore glanced out of the window, then back through the telescope. &quot;I&#39;m reasonably certain, however, that even the N.E.W.T.s don&#39;t cover astrology of extra-solar planets.&quot;<br><br>&quot;It&#39;s not...&quot; Hermione squirmed, then sighed. &quot;It&#39;s not astrology,&quot; she admitted. &quot;It&#39;s... science.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Oh?&quot; Dumbledore stepped back and studied the third-year thoughtfully. &quot;Ah, yes; I&#39;d quite forgotten you were Muggleborn.&quot; He tapped the telescope gently. &quot;So the planets of α Mione are of particular scienteric interest, are they?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Scientific,&quot; Hermione corrected, then slapped a hand to her mouth in dismay. &quot;Er, sorry, Professor. And no, not them in particular, but...&quot; She took a deep breath, and the words tumbled out. &quot;Muggle scientists discovered extrasolar planets for the first time last year, but they&#39;ve still only seen a few, and only indirectly, and only around really energetic stars called pulsars, and I thought that with magic I might be able to see better and find out more about them, and... and it turns out α Mione has a dozen different planets, so the seventh one would be called α Mione G, and I liked the... name... Professor.&quot;<br><br>Dumbledore gave her a long, serious look. Then, abruptly, he straightened up and beamed. &quot;Marvellous!&quot; he proclaimed. &quot;This sort of thing is why we should be encouraging Muggleborn students, you understand; the way you think is simply remarkable. Using magic to enhance science - quite wonderful.&quot; He chuckled, and then just as suddenly was serious again. &quot;But you must return all the things you borrowed right away.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yes, Professor,&quot; Hermione said, stooping to gather up the books. &quot;Sorry, Professor.&quot;<br><br>&quot;No harm done, Miss Granger.&quot; Dumbledore peered through the telescope again, then tugged thoughtfully on his beard. &quot;In fact... you may just have given me an idea.&quot;<br><br>Hermione looked at him warily. &quot;Professor?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yes, indeed.&quot; Dumbledore chuckled again. &quot;Extra-solar astrology - I should have thought of it myself.&quot; He slapped a hand onto Hermione&#39;s shoulder, causing the books to jump from her hands. &quot;Miss Granger, how would you like to be my secret weapon?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Er.&quot; Hermione stopped in the act of picking up a thick textbook. &quot;In what sense?&quot;<br><br>&quot;The only sense that matters,&quot; Dumbledore assured her: &quot;Wizard&#39;s chess! Minerva and I have been renovating the board used to protect the Stone, and it&#39;s about ready to be used; a horoscope from your α Mione G might be just the thing to tilt the odds in my favour.&quot; His eyes twinkled as he regarded the student. &quot;You&#39;d have to play as a pawn, of course - we couldn&#39;t have you standing out too much - but I think you and your starlet could change the course of the game in <i>many</i> surprising ways...&quot;<br><br><hr>
<br><br>Set during the first half of Hermione&#39;s third year. The planets of PSR B1257+12 (aka Lich) were discovered early in 1992, the first extrasolar planets confirmed to exist; following the convention of the time, they were numbered from A in order of their distance from the star.<br><br>So far as I know, there is no actual star named α Mione, but if there was it would be the brightest star in a constellation called Mione. I&#39;m pretty sure extrasolar astrology isn&#39;t taught at Hogwarts, and that Dumbledore has never met a scientor.<br><br>Hopefully I&#39;ve got them both somewhere close to in character; it&#39;s been a long time. :)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>[Prompt 2]<br><br>Not everyone admires heroes. Even among those never harmed by them (some people just get so bent out of shape when their evil plans are stopped), there are always going to be people who go against common opinion, even if only to be contrary. Some people believe that focusing on only one man demeans the ones who enabled his rise, since no heroic deed is done in a vacuum (with some exceptions, allowing for the existence of space programs and CERN). Some don&#39;t believe heroes exist, and thus can&#39;t trust any who call themselves such. Many are just very, very jealous. <br><br><br>I will leave it up to you to decide which of these applied to Danielle Henderson, &#39;Danni&#39; to friends. Not that she really had any; she was an awkward child whose parents didn&#39;t know how to handle their adopted daughter&#39;s unnerving tendency to make objects she hated explode, attract a surprising number of cats, and play tricks on other children even as she swore up and down that she&#39;d never laid eyes on electric blue hair dye in her life and never been anywhere near that amount of superglue. They loved her, true, but it must be said they were somewhat relieved to hear that Danni would be spending most of the year at a boarding school where she would learn how to make sure the thing with the squirrels never happened again. <br><br>When she boarded the Hogwarts Express, Danni didn&#39;t know what to expect from this school. Ten minutes later, she did know: Harry Potter. Apparently this kid was a year her senior, and if the redhead in her compartment was to be believed, the sun only rose when he wanted to wake up in the morning. You could tell he was a hero, because last year a teacher went mad and tried to kill him. He was still here, the teacher had been fired with extreme prejudice (i.e. he died horribly). He was hero of the wizarding world, he had friends, and he was notably averse to the amateur paparazzi that composed most of Hogwarts&#39; student body.<br><br>Danni had heard enough, and it was all things she didn&#39;t want to know. Here was a boy who knew what he was all about, could find kindred spirits like it was some sixth sense, and could break whatever rules he wanted and get honored for it. He was the sort who people would believe when he said he hadn&#39;t had anything to do with the squirrels. This all she decided without telling her compartment-mate, since even she wasn&#39;t bitter enough to ruin the girl&#39;s starry-eyed view of a kid who probably wouldn&#39;t give her the time of day (popular kids never did, in Danni&#39;s experience).<br><br>I believe now might be a good time to in form you all that one of Danni&#39;s greatest character flaws is premature judgement.<br><br></p>

            <p>&quot;Back! Back! Left foot back, left foot, keep your right in front!

The sword was wrenched out of Charlotte&#39;s hands and fell to the floor, and she jerked her foot away before it could get hit.<br><br>&quot;Can we take a break?&quot; Charlotte panted, hands on her knees.<br><br>Ix sheathed her sword and wiped her forehead on her arm. &quot;Break would be good,&quot; she said, pulling her wand from her belt and giving it a wave.

Thanks,&quot; she said, accepting her glass from Ix. She drank greedily, and Ix sat beside her, doing the same. <br><br>&quot;Want to give it another go when we&#39;re done?&quot; Ix asked. <br><br>&quot;Ehh...&quot; Charlotte leaned against her and sighed. &quot;I don&#39;t know. I&#39;m getting kinda discouraged about this. I&#39;m never gonna be as good as you.&quot;<br><br>Ix shrugged, fingers tangling loosely in Charlotte&#39;s hair. &quot;I wouldn&#39;t say that,&quot; she said. &quot;I just had to practice a lot. That&#39;s all it is.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I guess you&#39;re right.&quot; Charlotte sighed again. &quot;Still don&#39;t really feel like practicing any more right now.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Later, then.&quot; Ix pressed a kiss to Charlotte&#39;s cheek and stood up. &quot;But next time, you have to disarm me—and <i>then</i> we&#39;ll take a break.&quot;<br><br>Charlotte groaned and just lay back against the cushions.<br><br><br>(Also, since it&#39;s a ways down the Board, I finally got around to doing last week&#39;s prompt <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=318019;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">here</a>.)</p>

            <p>The desert sun was beating down hard and Tiger was beginning to feel like he was melting. He had been a little thirsty for the last few minutes, but it was only now that he realised that he was probably dehydrated. <br><br>According to the safety lecture, what he needed to do was to get water as soon as possible and then sit in the shade to recover.<br><br>There were two problems with that: he didn’t have any water with him and there was no shade in sight.<br><br>He began to mentally curse himself. He had been rather incompetent in several ways: he hadn’t drunk enough water before leaving, he hadn’t taken supplies with him on his spying mission, he hadn’t even prepared for this situation.<br><br>And of all the times he could get dehydrated, it just had to be on this stupid training battle his dad had organised.<br><br>Not that he saw anything wrong with training battles in principle – a chance to beat his sister was always great – but he didn’t see why they had to be in such inconvenient locations.<br><br>Taking a deep breath to calm himself, he thought through his options. He needed to get water now or else he’d be in serious danger. He couldn’t use a Water-Conjuring Spell (well, he probably could do, but the effort would put him out of the battle) so he had to get back to base and use the supplies.<br><br>It seemed a lot further away than he’d remembered, but eventually he saw the little hollow containing a couple of tents which was the base. As he got closer, he could see that something was wrong – one of the tents had collapsed and there was no sign of any of his classmates.<br><br>He walked in and saw that whatever had happened was pretty catastrophic – Andy was lying on the ground, “dead”. Of course, no-one really died in these exercises, but Tiger’s dad liked them to maintain as high a level of realism as possible so he wouldn’t be able to talk to Andy.<br><br>It was pretty clear what had happened – Holly had paid a visit. It looked as if his carefully laid plan was in ruins, before it had even begun.<br><br>The flap of the remaining tent opened and a hand beckoned him in. Tiger crouched down to enter the tent.<br><br>Inside it was extremely crowded – his three remaining classmates, Robin, Tim and Matt, were all squashed inside.<br><br>“What happened?” asked Tiger quickly. It was Robin who replied.<br><br>“The girls came and attacked us as soon as you were gone. We tried to put up a fight, but without you we had no chance and once Holly killed Andy we had to… make a tactical retreat. The thing is, they took all the supplies.”<br><br>Tiger groaned. “Even the water? I’m so thirsty!” Having said that, he immediately regretting sounding so whiny.<br><br>Robin nodded. “So… Boss…”<br><br>“General Lion,” Tiger replied, with his usual insistence on using the proper codenames.<br><br>“Sorry – General Lion – what do we do?”<br><br>Tiger smiled a little. “Isn’t it obvious? We take the battle to them, and we win it. If they have all the supplies, we just have to win them back.”<br><br>Holly wouldn’t expect that – or would she? She’d probably say it was just the kind of reckless thing he’d do and that it was doomed to failure.<br><br>On the other hand, they were doomed either way, so they might as well just attack. Tiger got to his feet and marched out of the tent, trying to supress his growing thirst.<br></p>

            <p>It&#39;s nice to see more of Tiger and get a better insight into his character. I do hope he learns to plan better in the future.<br><br>Also, I&#39;d say that the ending feels a bit more like the location of a scene break - I&#39;d expect there to be another bit showing the effects of the attack attempt or something after it.<br><br>- Tomash</p>

            <p>I...<br><br>Well, I dunno if I like it. {= ( I enjoyed the characters and their interactions, so I certainly don&#39;t <i>dis</i>like it... If it were an interlude about Kaitlyn finding out about POVs and being completely distracted by dorbs while Selene was trying to get her to focus on something more important, I reckon I&#39;d have nothing to complain about. But as a mission, it felt a bit POV-heavy to me. This is at least 50% a personal taste thing, since I&#39;m not interested in collecting critters and never have been, but I think it could use more commentary on the badfic, even if it isn&#39;t the usual so-bad-it&#39;s-funny mess. And that doesn&#39;t have to mean more fic-quotes. It&#39;s hard when the problem is blandness (which is one reason to avoid mediocre-fic in general), but you could play up that sort of thing by making the world extremely washed out, or sepia-toned, or fuzzy with deadened sound... or some other interpretation to show what dull writing does to a Word World and the unlucky agents forced to put up with it. It would make the agents feel more fully present, too.<br><br>Kaitlyn was so excited about who she was going to call in to help that I was, too, so I was sad it turned out to be a set-up to nothing. I was also sorta hoping &quot;Kelly&quot; would turn out to be Kelly the Roman Warrior somehow. Of course, she&#39;s dead, so it wouldn&#39;t make much sense, but when has that ever stopped a really determined Suvian? {= )<br><br>So, kinda unsatisfying as a mission. But, as More Fun with Kaitlyn and Selene, there are some great lines that made me laugh. &quot;That was <i>yesterday</i>,&quot; for one. The bit about the A-word and continuing into the not-a-Python-sketch, for another. And Kaitlyn&#39;s made-up story about what happened does sound like lots of fun. Very &quot;I reject your reality and substitute my own.&quot; Oh, also &quot;It&#39;s like kissing, only there&#39;s a winner,&quot; even if it is stolen. I don&#39;t know where it&#39;s from.<br><br>Is Kaitlyn&#39;s throne just a black office chair? My money&#39;s on standard high-back office chair. {= )<br><br>(You may be excused from reviewing anything of mine. Reckon it&#39;s more likely I owe you for something or other.)<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>No, I know what you mean. The big problem I had with this is that I have <i>no</i> connection to the source material, so it was hard to figure out what to say.

And wizards, I think.&quot;</i><br>Okay, important question... What about fighting zombie hordes in this setting?<br><br><i>&quot;I hope so.&quot; Kaitlyn ducked down and fished through the cupboard under the console. &quot;Where&#39;s the… aha.&quot; She flourished a battered looking smartphone and pointed it at the screen. &quot;Computer: upload canon database.&quot;<br><br>Selene blinked. &quot;Does that work?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Nope!&quot; Kaitlyn tapped on the phone, working through the transfer process. &quot;But it was fun. Have you set the disguises yet?&quot;</i><br>That sound over there was the hope of many agents gruesomely dying, you monster.<br><br><i>I stood in front of my 1954 Bentley R-Type continental one of the 208 ever made. It housed a Six cylinder, 4.5-litre engine. I loved my car but not as much as I loved my partner and sidekick.</i><br>Still not cooler than the Metallicar.<br><br><i>Kaitlyn rolled her eyes. &quot;Not that.&quot; She pointed at the dog-sized creature crouched next to the car. &quot;That!&quot;</i><br>Dog? Kill it with fire!<br><br><i>Selene checked the Words. &quot;It&#39;s a POV,&quot; she said. &quot;One of the capitalised ones. Look, it&#39;s spotted, because the fic uses periods in the-&quot;<br><br>&quot;It&#39;s adorable!&quot; Kaitlyn hissed. &quot;It&#39;s like a giant floofy hedgehog, it&#39;s amazing!&quot; She knelt down and held out her arms to the POV. &quot;C&#39;mere, lovely, come to Kaitlyn.&quot;</i><br>False alarm.<br><br><i>Selene waved one hand in the direction of the two protagonists. &quot;Skulduggery and Valkyrie. He thinks she&#39;s pretty. He&#39;s also a walking skeleton.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Huh.&quot; Kaitlyn studied the couple. &quot;Seems likely to put a damper on their love life.&quot;</i><br>Not if you believe some badficcers, or Undertales fans. Or Warm Bodies fans.<br><br><i>Selene gave the flock of rabbit-sized POVs a distinctly dubious look, which they returned from under their winged helmets. &quot;POV valkyries,&quot; she muttered. &quot;Just perfect.&quot;</i><br>What does the POVs&#39; Valhalla look like?<br><br><i>&quot;Don&#39;t look at me,&quot; the vampire said. &quot;That&#39;s General P.O.V; I&#39;m pretty sure it outranks you, even if,&quot; a milder dislocation swept across them, one that felt distinctly unsure of itself, &quot;even if you&#39;ve been named twice now.&quot;</i><br>Duck, they&#39;re preparing armies to take over the PPC. To arms agents, it&#39;s them or us!<br><br><i>&quot;That&#39;s called biting,&quot; her partner said. &quot;It&#39;s like kissing, only there&#39;s a winner.&quot;</i><br>Mandos must have some PTSD about this time she went in his Halls for Dafydd... And Kaitlyn must just love Belkar.<br><br><i>&quot;Don&#39;t steal lines, you&#39;ll get us reported for plagiarism.&quot; Selene looked across the vaguely-defined space - the fic couldn&#39;t decide whether it was still supposed to be on the pier - to where Skulduggery (&quot;Not you,&quot; she muttered to the POV) was attempting to get through an entire song in a single breath. &quot;And that&#39;s why you don&#39;t drop a line like &#39;I sang Me And Mrs Jones. our song.&#39; in the middle of a paragraph.&quot;</i><br>Where did that former line come from, please?<br><br><i>&quot;And I&#39;m talking to Cute Animal Friends.&quot; The vampire rubbed her forehead with one hand. &quot;What would Dafydd think of me?&quot;</i><br>Tell him they&#39;re Happy Tree Friends, and you&#39;re waiting for their death for more blood... What? They always come back.<br><br><i>&quot;I am,&quot; Kaitlyn said, holding up an armful of valkyrie POVs for her inspection. &quot;The general is getting the skulduggery POV under control, so I&#39;m keeping track of the valkyries.

Seriously, what does these critters eat?<br><br><i>&quot;But accurate.&quot; Selene got to her feet, ignoring Skulduggery P.O.V headbutting her leg. &quot;This entire chapter is incredibly generic; it doesn&#39;t tell you anything about the characters we&#39;re watching.

And that was when Meg Thornton - the Meg Thornton! - appeared out of thin air in front of him. &#39;I am a servant of the Lightning Bolt&#39;, she proclaimed, &#39;wielder of the Right of Despatch; the Dark Uncanon will not avail you, Gunner the Suvian!&#39; And Gunner just recoiled, and Selene dove in-&quot;<br><br>&quot;Kaitlyn, what are you doing?&quot;<br><br>Kaitlyn looked up from the circle of POVs, who were staring up at her open-mouthed. &quot;I&#39;m just filling the General and his tribe in on how the mission ended,&quot; she said. &quot;I feel bad that they had to miss out.&quot;</i><br>Just think about how we feel for missing on that too.<br><br><i>Standing next to roman the mini-Capitoline Wolf, Selene tilted her head in bewilderment. &quot;But… none of that happened,&quot; she said. &quot;Kayleigh and Salamander were off dealing with Tanith&#39;s baby, and Despatch weren&#39;t even there - we wouldn&#39;t call them in for an Implausible Crossover.&quot;</i><br>Go away, party pooper! Crazy epic won&#39;t be sullied by petty muddy reality!<br><br><i>Selene nodded slowly. &quot;It does have the advantage of being what happened.&quot;</i><br>And the overwhelming disadvantage of being–<br><br><i>&quot;But it&#39;s so boring!&quot; Kaitlyn tossed her hair dramatically, then turned back to her audience.</i><br>That.<br><br>Speaking of reality,... harsh but fair concrit. Just writing happy feelings without actual justification and development just cheapens it all. Not that the caharacters going through the grinder won&#39;t have opinions about this... But though love is a thing too, I guess.<br><br></p>

It&#39;s not my normal fare for PPC missions, and ordinarily I&#39;d say it had a lot of failings (mainly centering on a lack of description of and connection to the actual fic).

            <p>First things first: I don&#39;t know this canon either. |D But I <i>have</i> heard about it outside of the PPC, which can only be a good thing.<br><br>Thing the second: Kaitlyn&#39;s got quite a chair, there. I wonder if they do bar stools?<br><br>Third thing: Fictionaries!

I would read a fic about pancakes. Mostly because I enjoy eating them, but still. =P<br><br>LAST THING: I very much appreciate POV storytelling.

            <p>This thread is for sharing things you really, really like or things you really, really hate. <br><br>For example, I really like stories where the main character is about to lose. The villain has absolutely everything. There is nothing more that can be done. All hope is lost. Evil has triumphed... but then the main character uses the bonds of his friends or the power of love and compassion or some other virtuous strength and unlocks a power that they never knew they had or starts to finally use 100% of their power. They snap victory from the jaws of defeat at the critical moment. That&#39;s why I like it when a Yu-Gi-Oh! protagonist draws the exact card he needs to pull off some crazy combo that should not be possible, summon his Ultimate Super Evolved Boss of Justice with ∞^∞ ATK and win. Even if it&#39;s a Deus ex Machina, I don&#39;t care, it&#39;s just so satisfying.<br><br>That&#39;s why I absolutely hate 1984, even though I haven&#39;t read it. I can sympathize with the Sues who pretend to be rebels in that Verse. It&#39;s just... so... fixable...<br><br>I also hate Umbridge, Snape, and Malfoy (and by extension Sues that throw away all of their faults because he&#39;s so SAXAEY ECKS DEE) because they&#39;re extremely cruel and biased and just plain petty. I also hate anyone who falls under the same bully or power abuser archetypes as them or is just really petty.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m also a sucker for Power of Friendship/Power of Love-fueled victories. And magical girls. And magical girls kicking the bad guy&#39;s ass with the power of friendship. <br><br>You aren&#39;t alone in (your reasons for) hating Umbridge, Snape, and Malfoy&#39;s guts.

            <p>But then again, we&#39;re all very like-minded people here.<br><br>I hate stories that are in-your-face political or moral. Don&#39;t care who it&#39;s coming from, I hate Captain Planet just as much as I hate BibleMan. Or, well, I don&#39;t really show my hate for these things in a straightforward manner; I think it could be more described as &quot;loving to hate&quot; them. For instance, I love to make fun of Captain Planet. This is also the case with anything that&#39;s poorly written, hence why I can&#39;t stop churning out joke Mary Sues and badficcer avatars for the next Badfic Games. So yeah, love and hate rolled into one.<br><br>-Twistey</p>

            <p>But there are still things I like. Anything new and original is high on the list, as are plot twists I can’t predict.<br><br>Top of the list of things I hate are plot holes and inconsistencies. I have a habit of spotting them. I don’t think I found any in Harry Potter yet, but most others have at least one minor inconsistency. It’s the big ones that are the worst...<br><br>Quite high on it is when a series doesn’t know when to stop. There’s very few things more annoying than every single plot point being resolved, the bad guys are dead, and then they make a sequel.<br><br>If II keep going any longer this will turn into a rant, so I’ll stop there.</p>

            <p>I mean, I don&#39;t want to <i>see</i> it; I&#39;m just morbidly curious.<br><br>Along the same lines, one of my favorite things is when it seems like our heroes can&#39;t win and they don&#39;t see any way out but they keep going because it&#39;s right/it&#39;s who they are/if they give in the bad guys can do something awful/someone needs to stand up and say no. That scene at the end of <i>Return of the Jedi</i> where Luke almost gives into the Dark Side and then he doesn&#39;t and looks the Emperor in the face and says &quot;I am a Jedi, like my father before me&quot;? I get shivers every time. It&#39;s horribly cliché,but that doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s <i>bad</i>.<br><br>As for things I don&#39;t like, love triangles. They&#39;re not inherently bad, I guess, but I just vastly don&#39;t care and when stories get hung up on them I feel like my time is being wasted. Some people might like them, but they&#39;re not for me.</p>

            <p>I really like fics that explore character&#39;s limits. <br><br>Have you ever seen the movie The Four Feathers? It isn&#39;t much like the book. One of only a few things that I think the movie is better. (Ella Enchanted and The Princess Bride being the other two I can quickly think of). Anyway, Heath Ledger&#39;s character is  an officer in the British army back when they were basically appointed from the ranks of the gentry. He was the best at all the drills and practice. Then war breaks out in what seems to be northern Africa. He registers himself as a conscientious objector and resigns his commision. He spends the rest of the movie trying to redeem himself, ending up doing more heroics than any of the others, but  still considers himself to be a coward.<br><br>A lot of stuff happens and then there is this moment where it all snaps into place for him and he is transformed. That moment is what I like to read about in stories. <br><br>I really don&#39;t like fics that sexify canonically repulsive characters. (Either personality or physical appearance.) <br><br>I do, however, like stories that explore how a character ended up the way they did. A bit of a self brag, but of all the stories I have written, the one that I am most proud of (even if it has the fewest hits) is one that shows the descent of a character from a decent guy to an out of control murderer who has to be killed for the safety of the community. It never tried to make him not a bad guy, just a how did he get to that point? I love stories like that.</p>
