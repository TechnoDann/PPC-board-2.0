            <p>So I came across <a href="http://slatestarcodex.com/2017/12/26/a-history-of-the-silmarils-in-the-fifth-age/">this bit of rather crack-y theorizing about the current location of the Silmarils</a>. It seemed like the sort of thing people here might like, so here it is.</p>

            <p>San Tulkas makes <i>so</i> much sense. I assume the original gifts were food, as seen in the traditional elven tale of Good King Wénceslassë. If we assume Tulkas set up shop right after the fall of Utumno, he would initially have been giving to the Avari - the Quendi who refused to voyage to Valinor. Given that the only Valinorean contact they&#39;d had was with Oromë the Hunter, Tulkas probably took up hunting himself so as not to overly spook them. Then, when Men eventually showed up, he just stuck with it.<br><br>Now, the other theory I have problems with, starting the the fact that it&#39;s introduced with a reference to the Fifth Age. Tolkien was pretty clear that we were in the Sixth or Seventh (he seemed to view one or both of the World Wars as the changeover). So, tut!<br><br>I also protest the characterisation of Maglor. First off, who says Elves are white? The Noldor have always been the darkest-coloured elves (Galadriel&#39;s branch aside, House Finarfin is barely Noldorin); it&#39;s only our assumptions that make us picture them as paler than pale. Tolkien, notably, spent far more time describing eyes and hair than skin (assuming you accept &#39;fair&#39; as not indicating colour). So the whole illusion aspect is irrelevant. (It also shows a kind of &#39;illusion&#39; that doesn&#39;t appear in Tolkien - elven disguises were always item based, not &#39;magic&#39; like that.)<br><br>Secondly, Maglor wouldn&#39;t be hunting the Silmaril! He threw the blessed thing into the ocean, why would he go after it again? Yes, the Oath was still out there, but he knew to let well alone.<br><br>I also <b>highly</b> doubt that any group of Quendi would take their name from a king of Numenor. I&#39;m pretty sure &#39;Atanamir&#39; means &#39;Jewel of Men&#39;, too, which (though connecting to the jewel theme) is distinctly human, not elven.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>No, I mean, the whole drama surrounding the Silmarilli is an intersection of two related things:<br><br>-The Silmarils themselves. Made by Feanor, they contain the last uncorrupted light of the Two Trees. They&#39;re basically a slice of paradise, which is why everyone wants them. They&#39;re also... kind of maybe a little bit alive? It&#39;s hard to tell. Probably not as much as the Ring is, for instance, but maybe a little. They&#39;ve also been blessed by Varda, meaning nothing evil can touch them without being burned. This comes back in a big way to haunt Melkor, Carcharoth, possibly Ancalagon (it&#39;s not unreasonable to guess that Earendil&#39;s dragon-slaying antics were related to his possession of the Silmaril), and ultimately Maedhros and Maglor.<br><br>-The Oath of Feanor was a binding oath made by Feanor and his sons to never let anyone else have the Silmarils. And it is most <i>definitely</i> &#39;alive&#39;. Every time House Feanor do something stupid (which they do a lot), it&#39;s because the Oath has been quiet for too long and starts pushing them. Its explicit invocation in Nargothrond is enough to make the entire city abandon its king, despite the fact that there&#39;s only actually two Sons of Feanor present.<br><br>The Oath, and the fact that it binds them unless released by the One Himself (and God doesn&#39;t much go in for chatting with House Feanor), is responsible for all three Kinslayings, and the fall of every Elven realm in Beleriand, with the possible exception of Gondolin (depending on how much you feel the Oath was behind the debacle of the Nirnaeth).<br><br>Oh, and I guess there&#39;s a third intersecting thing: the Doom of Mandos.<br><br><i>Tears unnumbered ye shall shed; and the Valar will fence Valinor against you, and shut you out, so that not even the echo of your lamentation shall pass over the mountains. On the House of Fëanor the wrath of the Valar lieth from the West unto the uttermost East, and upon all that will follow them it shall be laid also. Their Oath shall drive them, and yet betray them, and ever snatch away the very treasures that they have sworn to pursue. To evil end shall all things turn that they begin well; and by treason of kin unto kin, and the fear of treason, shall this come to pass. The Dispossessed shall they be for ever.<br><br>Ye have spilled the blood of your kindred unrighteously and have stained the land of Aman. For blood ye shall render blood, and beyond Aman ye shall dwell in Death&#39;s shadow. For though Eru appointed to you to die not in Eä, and no sickness may assail you, yet slain ye may be, and slain ye shall be: by weapon and by torment and by grief; and your houseless spirits shall come then to Mandos. There long shall ye abide and yearn for your bodies, and find little pity though all whom ye have slain should entreat for you. And those that endure in Middle-earth and come not to Mandos shall grow weary of the world as a great burden, and shall wane, and become as shadows of regret before the younger race that cometh after. The Valar have spoken.</i><br><br>Part prophecy, part curse, part sheer intimidation, the Doom of Mandos accurately predicts the results of House Feanor&#39;s obsession with the Silmarils, and is also just plain awesome. ^_^ Seriously, read that through again.<br><br>But the Silmarilli themselves? They glow, and they burn bad people, and <i>maybe</i> they make people want them. That&#39;s about it.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Broadly, the Silmarils and the One Ring (and all the Great Rings) are artifacts imbued with power.<br><br>The Rings, unlike the Silmarils, actually do stuff. Not big flashy stuff, because that&#39;s not how magic in Middle-earth works, but stuff nonetheless. Narya the Ring of Fire granted powers of inspiration; Nenya the Ring of Water, of preservation; and Vilya the Ring of Air... I&#39;m not sure. It&#39;s supposed to be the greatest of the three, and considering the association with air and Manwë, possibly foresight, which we know Elrond had?<br><br>The One Ring specifically is imbued with the power and the active malice of Sauron, and almost certainly has a non-sapient will. It&#39;s described as <i>wanting</i> to be found, <i>seeking</i> a way back to its master, <i>drawing</i> the Nazgûl to it, etc., and it certainly makes its bearer want to use it. Those who hold the One Ring are tempted by visions of their greatest ambitions, all the things they could achieve with its power. But power, as we know, corrupts.<br><br>It can only grant power according to the bearer&#39;s ability to wield it, though, so it&#39;s less dangerous in the hands of a hobbit than it would be in the hands of an elf or an <i>istar</i>. And hobbitish ambitions aren&#39;t that grand, either, so they&#39;re less easy to tempt.<br><br>(How&#39;d I do, hS?)<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve always thought the Ring of Air was associated with protection and concealment: Rivendell is impossibly well-hidden, which could be the power of Vilya at work, but I think Elrond also says it&#39;s protected by the ring.<br><br>Which makes me think... we&#39;re used to thinking of the Three as basically an attempt by Celebrimbor to passively preserve everything, much like Galadriel does Lorien. But actually, if they were all used together, the Three would be an amazing offensive <i>weapon</i>.<br><br>-You use Vilya for stealth, and to help shield your armies from attack.<br>-You use Narya to rally the troops, boosting their morale to incredible levels.<br>-You use Nenya to control the battlefield. Just based on the Fellowship&#39;s visit to Lorien, you could use it to confuse time for your enemies, forcing their united front to straggle in over a couple of weeks.<br><br>Which, if you feel like being a Sauron apologist, offers a whole new explanation for his own actions: he knew full well that the Three would eventually be used against him (Noldor are incredibly racist against Melkorites; he had to basically dress up as one of them to get a friendly greeting), so he forged the One <i>not</i> primarily to control the other rings, but to spy on the Three. It&#39;s an intelligence effort, really.<br><br>... and then he declared war, massacred everyone, and used Celebrimbor&#39;s corpse as a battle flag, because Sauron ain&#39;t actually the good guy. <i>But still!</i><br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Both the Jewels and the Ring are macguffins of the &#39;everyone wants to get hold of it&#39; variety. They both serve other purposes to the story (the Ring lets Frodo and Sam sneak around and also acts as a beacon of sorts for Sauron, the Silmaril lets Carcharoth break into Doriath), but their primary role is to be a prize.<br><br>From an in-universe perspective, though, that&#39;s a secondary effect, and the two couldn&#39;t be more different. The Ring is a creation of power and control - its wielder can use it to basically take over the world. The Jewels, on the other hand, are important because they&#39;re the last uncorrupted drop of light. They &#39;want&#39; to be preserved, whereas the Ring &#39;wants&#39; to be used.<br><br>hS</p>

I&#39;d think that counts as removing it from continuity, which means the badfic was never killed at all.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>This leads us nicely to the &quot;Subjugation&quot; fiasco, where six agents were called in, two chapters were completed, and then nothing. Four of the agents showed up later, but still nothing is known. So is the badfic dead?</p>

            <p>And to answer classicfilmfan&#39;s question from my wiki talk page, the mission to take it down for good has been delayed because Real Life does not always arrange itself to suit our hobbies and I haven&#39;t yet figured out how the heck to tackle it without my cowriter. I&#39;d only figured out the plan for MY characters. I&#39;m working on some sort of arc for Su and Dio, but seeing as they&#39;re not mine and I don&#39;t have Tungsten&#39;s ingeniously off-the-wall brain, it&#39;s hard, and I&#39;m afraid of not doing them justice. {= /<br><br>I also started writing the story of how it all went wrong the first time, but like so many of my projects, it&#39;s fallen by the wayside until something inspires me to pick it up again.

            <p>Especially with Tungsten. Because if there&#39;s anything I&#39;ve learned from my recent archive binge that is actually worth explaining, topical, and that I&#39;m capable of desribing, it&#39;s there is only one Tungsten. I doubt any of us could stand in for her.</p>

            <p>Thanks to everyone for being so friendly and the various virtual gifts I’ve received!<br>I’ll try and answer the various questions you all have. Okay...<br>I’ve read quite a few missions but I don’t really have any particular favourite yet.<br>I’m thinking Harry Potter for my agents, probably just the DOMS. I have a rough idea what they’ll be like, but I’m still working on it.<br>I have a question myself: how do you go about finding badfic? Do you literally just scroll through fanfiction.net, or is there some magic badfic-finder I haven’t found out about yet?<br>Thanks again,<br>Snowblaze.</p>

            <p>I enjoyed every moment of it. Thank you. That&#39;s the kind of battle I&#39;ll quite happily lose everyday, the ones where you but all your energy into it, not because you want to be the best, but because you want to have as much fun in it as possible. </p>

            <p>Because I&#39;ve been here almost an hour at the moment. I am BST at the moment, so assuming you are East Coast, you should be 5 hours behind me (and so it should be almost 6:30pm for you). If you&#39;re not actually 5 hours behind me I apologise for not showing, but as this is it&#39;s the second time we&#39;ve missed each other. Please also let me know if you&#39;re going to be on as a name other than EPL (like I&#39;m Ihavenoinsurance on Showdown).

Don&#39;t know much about those other two, though - yay, potential learning opportunity! I have a lot of fandoms, a lot of original worlds, and a lot of parodies. Basically, too many ideas and not enough time to make them all reality.<br><br>So, what do you plan to do here? Any agent ideas? I&#39;d love to know more!<br><br>And finally, for your newbie gift, here&#39;s a piece of grey metal that fell off Das Executive Golem from Lichtspeer, as well as a piece of blue metal from over in Castle Wolfenstein. I haven&#39;t tried making these two into an alloy yet, but I have a feeling they&#39;ll end up being Licht-resistant. Do whatever you want with them!<br><br>Anyway, nice to meet you and welcome to the PPC!<br><br>-Twistey</p>

            <p>Although reading Araeph’s angry rant was amusing when I found the PPC, this is the PPC I actually wanted to join much later.

            <p>I wrote a good chunk of this, so I&#39;m not going to do a ton of commenting. In parts I wrote, there are some minor issues with clunky phrasing (which I&#39;ve just begun to try and sort, although some help would probably be nice if anyone wants to join in), but other than that I&#39;d say at least the sentiments are the right ones. This is an FAQ that might encourage people to work harder at their craft, try and join the board, or at least see us a a more-or-less positive force.

            <p>On the Discord today, Grundle brought up the idea of &quot;a Plortesque region set in the Periphery with each of us owning a star system&quot;. Thoth suggest the SpacePPC as a name. Larfen casually reminded us that there was a space plort that did exist, but everyone forgot about, that Delta made. Delta brought a link over from the original document (<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1acIdovoI4LU3axC_0lg05IR2A9a8Zrczj_z9aF2m-20/edit?usp=drivesdk"><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1acIdovoI4LU3axC_0lg05IR2A9a8Zrczj_z9aF2m-20/edit?usp=drivesdk">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1acIdovoI4LU3axC_0lg05IR2A9a8Zrczj_z9aF2m-20/edit?usp=drivesdk</a></a>) and I wanted to bring it back to life. I personally am going to start writing a new story, and encourage others to do the same.<br><br>If this gathers enough attention, I would make a 3d model of parts of the station in Unreal Engine 4, or some other engine. If I&#39;m not feeling up to it, maybe Minecraft instead. But I would definitely do it. <br><br>(This is really, really cool and thank you, Delta, for bringing this to me.)<br><br><br>- Maxewell</p>

            <p>This really is an interesting setting, and it&#39;s a good thing it&#39;s been resurrected.

            <p>This game is <i>not</i> augmented reality like we thought—it&#39;s a self-contained adventure game!<br><br>I downloaded it this morning and while I&#39;m still early in the game, it&#39;s pretty cute. The graphics are lovely, the character creation is actually pretty customizable (we have actual black skin colors instead of &#39;dark tan&#39;!), and so far the tutorial bot BFF is actually pretty sweet and adorable.<br><br>And there seems to be some sort of mystery afoot, as stated in the title! Your older brother was expelled from Hogwarts and has been missing ever since—he was going in search of the fabled &quot;Cursed Vaults&quot;. Which sounds a bit like the Chamber of Secrets, but I&#39;m still early in the game, so this might actually be decent.<br><br>The gameplay is simple enough to figure out, the characters are cute, and like I said—the graphics are lovely. And a helpful hint if you decide to pick it up: If you see house-elves in the corridors, tap them! They give you goodies. :D<br><br><a href="https://i.imgur.com/MTvh62V.png"><a href="https://i.imgur.com/MTvh62V.png">https://i.imgur.com/MTvh62V.png</a></a><br><br><a href="https://i.imgur.com/PBVIT2n.png"><a href="https://i.imgur.com/PBVIT2n.png">https://i.imgur.com/PBVIT2n.png</a></a><br><br><a href="https://i.imgur.com/JruoXS2.png"><a href="https://i.imgur.com/JruoXS2.png">https://i.imgur.com/JruoXS2.png</a></a> <br><br>(Also, for some reason, the &lt; img src=&quot;URL”/ &gt; cuts off anything else I attempt to post below it now, so if anyone knows how to put images directly in Board posts I&#39;d appreciate knowing that.)</p>

            <p>This is a free to play game. Ostensibly.<br><br>In the game, you have a resource called energy, and in order to complete quests, you have to tap around the game world and complete various actions, which require energy to do. You&#39;re very generously given one free energy every three and a half minutes—otherwise, you have to buy more with in-app purchases.<br><br>In order to advance the storyline, you also have the option of purchasing in-game gemstones to unlock the story quests; otherwise you&#39;ll get waiting times of an hour, three hours, and possibly even longer in later parts of the game.<br><br>To say I&#39;m supremely disappointed by this is putting it mildly. You already have in-game currency to purchase to customize your character! Blocking off the story until you either pony up the cash or wait for hours to advance?<br><br>Boo. Major boo. I&#39;m going to keep playing because I want to know what else happens in here, but I absolutely refuse to cave and buy permission to play through the story right away.</p>

            <p>I, too, have been sticking it out because I want to know what happens, but I am annoyed at the energy system.<br><br>Maybe if they had a better balance - where, say, paying means you can progress faster by doing less of the many repetitive tasks, but you can still have things to do without spending real-world money, I think I&#39;d be less frustrated.<br><br>*mild spoilers?*<br>Another thought that the game seems, thus far, to be copying a lot of bits from the original books - characters that are suspiciously similar to Malfoy and Neville (if less fleshed-out) and a whispered voice only you can hear that is very reminiscent of the Chamber of Secrets.</p>

            <p>That right there is every single interactive story app on the App store. Except maybe a few that I could&#39;ve missed.<br><br>But nonetheless. Episode. Choices. All the chat story apps. They all do that. It&#39;s terrible, it&#39;s sneaky, it&#39;s unjust, but it&#39;s common.

            <p>I think a big part of it is that FL simply has among the best writing of any game that uses this system. Seriously, hats off to the FBG writing crew, they&#39;ve been consistently amazing. Nevermind that they keep bringing in top-notch freelancers like Emily Short (award-winning IF writer) to round things off.<br><br>Another part of it is that FL&#39;s gameplay is really passive. You play for a few minutes every few hours or so in a side tab, and that works very well. If you really want more, you can buy Fate, or sign up as an Exceptional Friend—Which actually gives you content, not just more actions.<br><br>The other thing is, that action system is there to gate content, but in FL, it&#39;s not just a moneymaking thing: it&#39;s an integeral part of how the game works. If I had to guess, FBG probably makes most of their money on bought stories or Exceptional Friendships, where the primary benefit is content, not more actions. No, FBG has the action cap in place to keep you from burning through all their content at once, and to give themselves time to expand the game: otherwise, they&#39;d have to try and write as fast as you can read, or you&#39;d lose interest.<br><br>Finally, it&#39;s pretty generous with actions. Sure, you only get 20, but 20 actions get you pretty far. By the time you&#39;ve burnt through your actions in FL, you always feel like you&#39;ve made a good amount of progress on whatever you&#39;re doing.<br><br>Hope that works.</p>

            <p>because Harry Potter is a series world-famous specifically <i>for</i> its writing, and is an already established franchise with a well-developed world that people are already interested in exploring. <br><br>Whereas Fallen London had to actively introduce new people to this world, draw them in, et al.<br><br>It just goes to show how mishandled this particular Harry Potter game was, doesn&#39;t it? It seems they tried forcing the Harry Potter concept into a vaguely themed mobile game, arbitrarily abandoning its interesting writing or worldbuilding or so on, all ignoring the fact that you <i>can</i> have that kind of stuff in this kind of game. <br><br>It&#39;s a bit of a dream, but picture, if you will, a Fallen London style Harry Potter game, written by Rowling and, I dunno, some assistants who write much like her. Where it does the same stuff as Fallen London - allows the player to be immersed into this fun, interesting world but instead, of course, into the world of Harry Potter.</p>

            <p>That all makes a lot of sense. <br><br>I think the balance of actions to gameplay and the quality of writing (so you do actually feel like it’s worth waiting for) is what does it for me. It feels a bit like reading a magazine of good stories published in serial (albeit more complex and personally customized).</p>

            <p>Does it at least let the timer tick down without the game being open? If so, you could treat it as a &#39;one quest per day&#39; thing, where you start the countdown the evening before and then pick it up once it&#39;s unlocked.<br><br>One mark of how good a mobile game is, is how successfully it balances gameplay without paying, and the incentive to pay. One that I&#39;ve had on my phone for a while, <i>Star Trek: Timelines</i>, is very stingy with its currency; it almost never gives out the best of the in-game currencies (which you can use to buy powerful ships and characters), and only trickles in the one needed for performing actions.<br><br>The saving graces in that game are that you don&#39;t actually <i>need</i> the stuff you can buy (I mean, I&#39;d love to have access to a third shuttle, but two works just fine)... and that whenever they have connection issues, they apologise by giving out a thousand action currencies at a time. ^_^ It makes it pretty hard to run out unless you really try. It&#39;s impossible to ride that to a position high on the scoreboards in the various events (I tried once, burnt through over 2000 action points and didn&#39;t crack the top 10,000), but it&#39;s perfectly fine for just playing the game.<br><br>Unfortunately, it doesn&#39;t sound like this one has anything similar, and the result is what you say - frustration for free players, which is more likely to make them abandon the game than pay for it. Hopefully they get that balance sorted out soon.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Micro-transactions are now pretty much a requirement for a mobile game. Either to boost your stats, or to advance story quicker. The &quot;Fantastic Beasts&quot; game had that, the Avengers Academy had that, and now Hogwarts Mystery has it, too. Can&#39;t say I&#39;m happy with that.</p>

            <p>She slowly backed down the corridor, her breaths becoming quick and shallow when she realized the teleport had failed. She bumped into something and turned around: a dead end, just a smooth wall with a mirror. She stared back at her reflection, gaze focusing in on the way her braces-covered teeth jutted out.<br><br>Laughter echoed in the maze and she flinched, clutching her Manual closer to her. She couldn&#39;t see the source, just an endless corridor full of mirrors. She began walking, her steps hesitant, nervous. <br><br>So many mirrors. Her skin crawled as her eyes shifted to glance at her reflection as she passed.<br><br>Her knees were too knobby. Her face was covered in acne. She was too tall and gangly. Her jaw looked crooked from the hinge glued to her teeth, and her huge, dorky glasses emphasized how square her face looked. <br><br>And those pigtails. God, what had she been thinking? Never mind how much her mother told her the knotted pigtails looked adorable on her, they were hardly considered attractive at her school.<br><br>She was too scrawny. Her boobs were too big, to the point where the other girls had tried stealing her clothes, demanding to know if she stuffed her bra.<br><br>The laughter echoed down the corridor again.<br><br>Her reflections began shifting slightly as she passed, and she knew, in the way one knows when one is dreaming, exactly what each mirror was showing her. She couldn&#39;t avoid seeing it. In that one—she was a failure. She was stupid. She was pathetic. She was useless. Worthless. Ugly. A loser.<br><br><i>Useless. Stupid. Pathetic. Worthless. Useless. Stupid. Pathetic. Worthless.</i><br><br>All her worst fears laid out for her to see, and she broke into a run, the laughter getting louder. Out of the corner of her eye, she could see other faces in the mirrors, faces she didn’t recognize, some of them not even human—but whenever she turned to look, she couldn’t see anything but herself.<br><br>She ran into a circular room coated in mirrors, and when she turned around to try a different path, she found the way out had disappeared.<br><br>&quot;Stop it!&quot; she screamed.<br><br>&quot;<i>Stop it! Stop it!</i>&quot; her voice echoed tauntingly.<br><br>&quot;Leave me alone!&quot;<br><br>&quot;<i>Leave me alone! Leave me alone!</i>&quot;<br><br>She dropped her Manual and covered her eyes, sinking to the floor.<br><br>&quot;<i>Crybaby! Crybaby!</i>&quot;<br><br>&quot;<i>She thinks she can be a wizard!</i>&quot;<br><br>&quot;<i>She can&#39;t even pass fifth grade!</i>&quot;<br><br>&quot;<i>Hahahaha!</i>&quot;<br><br>She screamed, and the mirrors shattered, the glass falling to the floor with a soft tinkle at odds with the reverberating screams.<br><br>When she opened her eyes, the room was clear of glass, empty save for her, her Manual, and... herself, staring at her with a curious glee.<br><br>She stared back. &quot;Who are you?&quot;<br><br>The other her smiled. &quot;You know me,&quot; she said. &quot;I&#39;ve been with you for years now... that little voice in your head, that entity looking over your shoulder, watching every last little mistake you make...&quot; She began circling, eerily reminiscent of a shark. &quot;Do you have any idea how <i>stupid</i> you were to come here? No, probably not. If you did, you wouldn&#39;t be in this situation in the first place.&quot;<br><br>The would be wizard slowly crouched to grab her Manual, not taking her eyes off the doppelgänger. &quot;Why are you doing this?&quot; she whispered.<br><br>The doppelgänger laughed. &quot;Why? Because I <i>can</i>. It&#39;s not like you&#39;ve ever tried to stop me before. Loser.&quot;<br><br>She swallowed; her palms were slick with sweat and her knees were shaking. &quot;You&#39;re my Ordeal?&quot;<br><br>The doppelgänger rolled her eyes. &quot;Uh, <i>duh</i>.&quot; The circling continued. As she walked, she began to change, going from knobby-kneed, acne-covered, to... beautiful. Breathtaking. Poised, confident. The doppelgänger stopped, spreading her hands and smirking. &quot;That&#39;s the problem with you... well, one of a really long list of many. You&#39;re always too busy overthinking things. Idiot. Of <i>course</i> I&#39;m the Ordeal; what else could this possibly be?&quot;<br><br>She lowered her eyes, blinking back tears. Of course. Of course. She should have known from the moment she entered the maze. <i>Stupid, stupid, stupid.</i><br><br>&quot;You <i>are</i> stupid,&quot; the doppelgänger said coldly. &quot;But hey, you&#39;re not a totally lost cause yet. Maybe if you ditched your Manual and went home, put all this behind you, accept you&#39;ll only ever be mediocre at best, you might actually be worth something.&quot; She shrugged. &quot;Or you can stay in here and die of starvation. Seems more likely. Too dumb to cut her losses and run, and try to salvage what&#39;s left of your pathetic life.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Why are you so <i>mean?!</i>&quot; She burst out. &quot;What did I ever to to make you hate me?&quot;<br><br>The doppelgänger was suddenly standing in front of her, eyes blazing. &quot;Absolutely <i>nothing</i>. And that&#39;s what makes it so. Damn. <i>Easy</i>.&quot;<br><br>They stared at each other for a long minute; the silence stretched between them, tension palpable. She was trembling; the words were familiar, words she&#39;d thought hundreds, thousands of times before, but never had they come from such a familiar face.<br><br>The doppelgänger laughed and turned away as mirrors began to fade into existence, hemming them in together. &quot;Oh, wow, you really think that?&quot; She turned back, and her face had changed, mirroring the wizard&#39;s again. Acne, glasses, braces, and everything else that just emphasized how <i>ugly</i> she was. The doppelgänger opened her mouth, clutching dramatically at her cheeks. &quot;Maybe if I wasn&#39;t such a failure, Mom would love me!&quot;<br><br>&quot;You&#39;re me,&quot; she realized, her heart sinking.<br><br>The doppelgänger applauded sarcastically. &quot;Took you long e-freaking-nough.&quot;<br><br>&quot;But if you&#39;re me,&quot; she muttered, &quot;then that means I&#39;m...&quot;<br><br>&quot;Your own Ordeal, yes, yes. Get on the same page already, gawd.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Shut up!&quot; she snapped. &quot;I&#39;m thinking.&quot;<br><br>&quot;In your own slow, dimwitted way, maybe.&quot;<br><br>&quot;SHUT UP!&quot; Her voice echoed around them. &quot;You&#39;re not—you&#39;re—you can&#39;t just say things like that!&quot;<br><br>A soft light flared out from around her, and then faded.<br><br>&quot;And why not?&quot; the doppelgänger said, before she had a chance to wonder at the light. &quot;You&#39;ve been saying them to yourself for years! Why stop now?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Because... because...&quot; She trailed off, closing her eyes. Every instinct in her body was screaming at her that she was about to say something she couldn&#39;t take back; that what she was about to say couldn&#39;t possibly be true, but if this was her Ordeal, and her small act of defiance had caused that light to appear... maybe this was what she had to do. Maybe... she just had to believe. When she next spoke, it was with the Speech. &quot;<i>Because you&#39;re wrong.</i>&quot;<br><br>Light flared out around her again. The doppelgänger flinched back like she&#39;d been struck. &quot;<i>What?</i>&quot;<br><br>&quot;<i>Because you&#39;re wrong,</i>&quot; she repeated, more loudly, and the light brightened. &quot;<i>Because maybe I&#39;m not the best at everything. And maybe I&#39;m not the bravest, or the smartest, or the prettiest—but I&#39;m doing my best, you hear me?!</i>&quot;<br><br>The light kept growing, and she began walking towards the doppelgänger, hands tightening around her Manual. &quot;I took the Oath because it gave me hope! I thought I could finally make something of myself!&quot;<br><br>&quot;You were wrong!&quot; the doppelgänger yelled, jerking away from the light as it reached her. &quot;You were wrong, you&#39;re going to fail at being a wizard, just like you&#39;ve failed everything else—&quot;<br><br>&quot;<i>I haven&#39;t failed yet, though!</i>&quot; she yelled back, and hope swelled in her chest and the light brightened in a halo around her. &quot;<i>And if I haven&#39;t failed, there&#39;s still a chance! I can keep going and—and improving, and getting better, and nothing you can say will stop me!</i>&quot; She opened her Manual, running her fingers over its pages. &quot;<i>I will put aside fear for courage, and death for life, when it is right to do so—and I will not be afraid of myself any more!</i>&quot; <br><br>She pulled the stick of chalk from her pocket and crouched on the ground, beginning to redraw her spell from before, only this time, she made sure to get her name <i>right</i>—her real name, her name that was more than just her flaws and fears and downfalls, a name that was also her hopes and dreams and assets. Her doppelgänger screamed and raged, but made no attempt to touch her, and she tuned her out, focusing on her spell. This place, this… <i>maze</i>, she didn’t know what it was, but she knew it had to be destroyed before it could claim any other wayward souls.<br><br>“Alright,” she muttered to herself as she began working on the main part of her spell. “Alright, let’s see here…”<br><br>It wasn’t enough to just collapse this place like she’d originally thought. When she tried to listen to the walls, she heard nothing. Everything that was alive spoke to her, but this maze was… dead. No, not dead—worse. Darker. More ancient and evil, designed to prey on the lost and scared. How many other wizards had been trapped here when they failed to properly write their names, trapped and doomed to fail in their Ordeals?<br><br>Over the screams of her doppelgänger, she could hear whisperings coming from the walls.<br><br>The chalk in her hands was damp from sweat and her knees were covered in white dust, and still, she kept working, tugging her Manual along after her as she worked her spell. When it came to the part where she had to describe the maze, though, she froze.<br><br>What was she supposed to write? How was she supposed to know the words she’d have to Speak to collapse this place?<br><br>“See?” the doppelgänger said, breaking into her thoughts. “You’re a worthless, spineless, pathetic excuse for a wizard! Can’t even think of what—”<br><br>“Shut <i>UP!</i>” she roared, her shoulders tensing.<br><br>The whispering stopped for a moment, and then resumed.<br><br>She stared down at the circle she’d already constructed. This would take so much raw power to complete—if only she could figure out the <i>words</i>.<br><br>Her thoughts drifted back to how she’d gotten here, with her botched attempt at a teleport. Something in that spell had brought her here.<br><br>If this maze—this entity—didn’t have a life of its own, it had to draw its energy from somewhere.<br><br>From the mirrors. From its victims. From <i>her</i>.<br><br>Her hands shook as she wrote her name, her broken name. The name that she’d written containing only her worst aspects. And she mirrored it, and she twisted it into the warped abomination she’d found herself running from, and she sealed the circle.<br><br>“Don’t you dare!” hissed the doppelgänger.<br><br>She didn’t bother responding, instead standing up and dusting her hands off on her pants and picking up her Manual. And she began to read, weaving her spell as the doppelgänger screamed and thrashed and convulsed behind her. Sweat beaded on her forehead and she could feel her grip on her Manual becoming slick, but she pressed on. The light began to grow brighter and brighter as she continued to speak of light and life and hope. She spoke of joy and passion and of love, and the light grew brighter and the doppelgänger’s scream became even louder, threatening to drown her out.<br><br>There was a deafening sound of shattering glass, and she had to shut her eyes against the blinding light.<br><br>When she opened them again, the sky was blue and the grass was green, and a gentle wind caught her pigtails. She laughed and closed her Manual, falling backwards onto the grass and kicking her feet up in the air as she hugged her Manual to her chest.<br><br>She was still afraid, dreadfully afraid—but she wasn&#39;t going to let the fear hold her down like before. She had passed her Ordeal and she was now a wizard. Maybe not the best, maybe not the brightest, but a wizard all the same.<br><br>And surely, that had to count for something.<br><br><br><br><br><br>((Once again, a massive thanks to Delta Juliette for helping me out with this one and giving me the last bit I needed to make the spell feel right. Wouldn&#39;t have been able to do it without her.))</p>

            <p>I jest, I jest (mostly).<br><br>I really like the spell in the new section (I&#39;ve already commented on the first part, right?). The physical mirroring of the name to match the mirroring of... huh, she never gets a name, does she? Ixiwiz - is excellent, and feels very Duane-ish. I also like the idea hinted at that the House of Mirrors isn&#39;t just Ixiwiz&#39;s fears writ large - it&#39;s a malevolent entity (possibly even an entire parallel dimension?) that feeds off people&#39;s fears. That fact turns this from a story about Ixiwiz gaining self-confidence (which, under most circumstances, wouldn&#39;t in itself justify the Powers&#39; offering wizardry to her) into one about her taking down a major problem that could practically have been designed to trap her.<br><br>There&#39;s a principle in the books that &#39;all is done for each&#39; - that while you&#39;re out solving problems with your Art, the problem solving ends up helping you, too. This is very much at play here, at least in the subtext.<br><br>One thing I will highlight is the fact that in the /first/ half, you pulled all the subtext out and named it. It started off unclear, but eventually the Mirror was flat out saying &#39;I&#39;m your Ordeal&#39;. The transition to all the themes being unstated, only seen by implication, is mildly jarring; I&#39;m actually wondering if it migh be deliberate? The shift happens at the moment Ixiwiz starts completely ignoring the Mirror, so it could be thematic.<br><br>Another thing I like is that you&#39;ve done something none of the rest of us did, but all the main-series canon Ordeals do: you&#39;ve made Ixiwiz an active participant in getting to the Hall of Mirrors. Where Jacob, Lise, Julia and Marisa just found themselves in the relevant locations, and Siobhan was dragged there by a parrot, Ixiwiz actively teleported there. Sure, it was accidental - but Nita and Kit didn&#39;t intend to go where they did, either.<br><br>The one question I really want to see answered - the one that makes me actually ask for Part One - is: why Ixiwiz? It&#39;s clear why the Hall of Mirrors needed to be shattered, but what made Ixiwiz uniquely suited to the task? In the other completed stories, we have geekery, rocketry, and cyber...y, all making the kids in question The Right Person to take on their various threats, but here it almost seems the opposite: like Ixiwiz was a /bad/ choice, because she was likely to fall prey to it.<br><br>What&#39;s running through my head as an explanation (I can&#39;t help it, I headcanon everything) is that maybe that&#39;s the point. The Hall of Mirrors is obviously old and powerful - if I&#39;m right, it&#39;s an entire universe of the Lone Power&#39;s domaim - and it must have learnt caution. A confident wizard who would blow it up with fire would never be able to find it. But someone who could be her own bait - who was exactly the sort of person it wanted to feed on, and a wizard to boot, so the Lone One would be delighted to take her out - but who was at heart strong enough to overcome it... that&#39;s someone who the Powers could extend the Oath to, and let her solve Their problem and find her own solution along the way.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I was more thinking about the Maze telling Baby Wizard that it was her Ordeal was just more preying on her fears/insecurities: &quot;Yep, I&#39;m your Ordeal, and you&#39;re an idiot for not realizing it earlier.&quot; It&#39;s not so much the Maze talking to her as it is a bit of herself that it&#39;s appropriated to wear. If that makes sense?<br><br>As for why her... something I&#39;ll have to flesh out in the hypothetical Part One. My thought process was something like this:<br><br>Baby Wiz is me, set around fifth grade. I was bullied a lot, blah blah, sad story, blah, started to internalize a lot of that, but at the same time I was desperately hoping for something, <i>anything</i>, to help me prove I was better than I (and they) believed. Becoming a wizard obviously wouldn&#39;t solve that overnight—it certainly didn&#39;t for Nita—but it&#39;d be a push in the right direction, and sooner or later (later for me in the real world, sadly), Baby Wiz would&#39;ve snapped and fought back, and being goaded by an enemy she <i>knew</i> she wasn&#39;t helpless against would have done the trick.<br><br>(As for why Baby Wiz doesn&#39;t have a name, I was still going by my deadname at the time and didn&#39;t really feel like doing a rehash of Juliette&#39;s own story, so no name it was.)</p>

            <p>You&#39;ve done a great job of explaining why Baby Wix needed the help the Powers gave her. What I&#39;m really interested to know, though, is why the Powers need /her/ help. &#39;High Wizardry&#39; (don&#39;t know if you&#39;ve got that far?) goes on a bit about how brand new wizards - particularly the very young ones - are a major investment of energy, so the Powers choose them based on their ability to immediately use that power in a major move against the Lone One. (The canon confuses this slightly with Daryll&#39;s Ordeal, but Daryll is... different.) While I&#39;m sure They would love to help out every receptive lost soul, entropy is running, and Their energy is limited. (As a potent example of this: the Planetary for Earth mentions in the last book that her infant son had a variety of leukemia. It was able to be cured by wizardry, but that doesn&#39;t mean Earth&#39;s wizards are now out curing every case. Rather, they&#39;ve arranged for the non-wizardly aspects of the treatment to be leaked into the medical establishment.)<br><br>I know I&#39;m rambling, but I just want to know whyyyyy--! ^_~<br><br>(As for your explanation of the Maze, yes, that&#39;s very clear. And I think you should name her Renesmee. &gt;:D)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>As for minis: obviously that&#39;s up to the first person to use them in a mission. I&#39;m pretty sure <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=1TTjD03ZS0IMof0YvtoC1Sn3863vtxyFZhyNct-Qihb0">Kaitlyn didn&#39;t</a>... and it looks like <a href="http://starshadowhall.tripod.com/ppc/rc999/02wfwd.html">Nesh didn&#39;t either</a>.<br><br>So... I&#39;m always uncomfortable with sapient minis, and Mobiles are wizards in their own right. They&#39;re also already mini-sized - and not really monsters! So I&#39;d argue against them.<br><br>Hmm... the thing that&#39;s popping into my head is the carnivorous cars in SoYouWiz. They&#39;re a minor enemy (like the Balrog, or Aragog), sentient without being sapient, and the idea of two-foot-long sports cars racing around biting things is hilarious. ^_^ I think mini-Lotus Esprits is a unique mini, too (whereas things like the kraken or the not-a-dragon thing are a bit generic), and using the specific make of that one car lets me avoid a generic name like &#39;mini-evil cars&#39;.<br><br>So that&#39;s my pick. (Second option is the metal scorpions from Mars, but again I think they&#39;re a bit small.)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I know they used to be (Balrog, Aragog, about a million different dragons), but I admit I&#39;ve not kept up with the recent OFUs and mini-creations.

            <p>The sky outside the window of the Group Dynamic was warm and clear and inviting, with only the merest wisps of cloud far away. It was also an electric orange colour, as if the whole world was a street light. It hung serenely above an enormous plain, full of rich purple grasses and stubby, thick-trunked trees like fat acacias. There was one close by, and Siobhan could see a bright white fruit hanging from its boughs. Without really understanding how, she <i>knew</i> it was delicious, some distant bit of human ancestry screaming at her to eat it and find more.<br><br>The distinct lack of Norwich only made it more enticing.<br><br>The three Nigerian wizards from the next table over were the first to investigate, creaking open the door of the Group Dynamic as they cast a few spells to enable them to breathe. As intoxicating as the view out there was, Siobhan&#39;s head was still turned by wizardry, even - perhaps especially - when put to such casual use. She was watching closely as they stepped outside, but didn&#39;t quite see them leave. A blink at the wrong moment. She never was much cop at staring contests.<br><br>Seeing them out of the window, though, they seemed... happy. Much happier than they had in the pub. A few more wizards joined them, fascinated by the country they saw outside. And more. And more. And more. The hubbub was gone, now. Siobhan, Purple, and Wombat were alone.<br><br>&quot;Why,&quot; said Wombat after a long moment, &quot;are the bar staff still here?&quot;<br><br>One of them made a strangled hissing noise that the two wizards understood as &quot;More than my job&#39;s worth, guv.&quot;<br><br>Siobhan shrugged and looked at her blue Coke. &quot;Does this... does this normally happen?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Eh, sometimes. But they put a sign up when they&#39;re going anywhere, and I&#39;ve not seen it. Going off-planet like this unannounced? Screws up the coordinates for a claudication. Maybe I missed the memo or something, but I normally go, and Gary the Gasworks is usually pretty good about letting people on the mailing list know.&quot;<br><br>&quot;So, you&#39;re saying that the landlord of this place takes the entire pub on a bloody <i>interplanetary booze cruise</i>?&quot;<br><br>&quot;No!&quot;<br><br>Siobhan sagged a bit. &quot;Let me guess. Gary the Gasworks isn&#39;t the landlord.&quot;<br><br>&quot;<i>Skree</i>, chick, no flies on you, are there? How would he even fit? This gaff&#39;s not that big.&quot; Purple pecked at his pint of nuts. &quot;Nah, Gary&#39;s just the bloke who sorts out the invites. He doesn&#39;t get offworld much, on account of how he can&#39;t move, so a bunch of local wizards help him get around.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Wait.&quot; Wombat&#39;s voice was slow and incredulous. &quot;Is he actually-&quot;<br><br>&quot;The St. Martin&#39;s gasworks, yeah. Nice bloke. He planned my stag do.&quot;<br><br>Siobhan stared into her drink for a while as she tried to process that. It felt a bit like her brain was starting to dribble out of her ears.<br><br>---<br><br>&quot;Okay, time for another blue soft drink.&quot; Siobhan stood up. &quot;Want anything, you two?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I&#39;m alright, ta,&quot; said Purple. &quot;Do you fancy something stronger?&quot;<br><br>&quot;<i>Christ</i> yes.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Tough.&quot;<br><br>Siobhan came back with a tray a few minutes later to find Purple staring wistfully out of the window.<br><br>&quot;Reminds me of Akosho Gul,&quot; he said. &quot;I think it&#39;s the fruit trees. Probably the sky, too. You never forget your first new sky.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yeah,&quot; said Siobhan. &quot;I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll ever forget this. It&#39;s so... so different.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I just... I&#39;ve got to go out and give it a try. Just one of those fruits. Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ll ask first, I&#39;m not a gannet.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Okay. Just, you know. Be careful out there, alright?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Will do, chick. I&#39;ll save you some. Not a lot, but some.&quot; Purple took off from the pint glass and flew towards the door. &quot;I mean, it&#39;s in my name, after all!&quot;<br><br>Siobhan&#39;s eyes widened and her breath caught the her throat and she nearly knocked the table over as she scrambled to her feet but it<br><br>was too late<br><br>and Purple was out of the door and gone.<br><br>---<br><br>Siobhan dragged her Manual out of a pocket, brushed bits of grimy sand and desiccated crisp fragments off the cover, and slammed the book open on the table so hard that Wombat briefly became airborne. As with all uses of a Manual, it opened at the page she needed. As with all uses of <i>her</i> Manual, the information was couched in bone-dry academic prose and tangential examples from history, with spell diagrams beaten into bronze plaques or painted on cave walls.<br><br>&quot;Are you okay, Siobhan?&quot; Wombat&#39;s voice was shot through with veins of black worry like a marble statue.<br><br>&quot;Emics and etics,&quot; Siobhan replied.<br><br>&quot;Eh?&quot;<br><br>&quot;In-group and out-group analysis,&quot; she mumbled, along with more stuff Wombat couldn&#39;t hear.<br><br>&quot;... Eh?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I&#39;m an idiot. A massive, massive idiot. I got so caught up in magic and everyone else&#39;s magic that I forgot what was going to <i>happen</i>.&quot;<br><br>---<br><br>Purple soared through the door, dimly noticing the flash behind him, and he danced through the air until he collided bodily with the voluminous bum of an extremely confused elephant.<br><br>Once he shook the stars out of his vision, he looked around at the array of wizards...<br><br>Crammed into the Colman&#39;s mustard museum.<br><br>&quot;... Oh, <i>SKREE</i>!&quot;<br><br>---<br><br>&quot;The fruit tree outside. I saw white, which is weird because fruit isn&#39;t white, it&#39;s brightly coloured to attract people to it. But Purple saw a purple fruit, because I want answers and he wanted... I dunno, lunch? The point is, what did you see?&quot;<br><br>&quot;... I thought we were floating in deep space or something.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Because you don&#39;t really <i>want</i> anything, at least not that can be shown outside a window.&quot;<br><br>---<br><br>&quot;You don&#39;t understand, Patience, she&#39;s not on errantry, she&#39;s on ORDEAL!&quot;<br><br>---<br><br>&quot;So, the question is: If something is so strange, so tempting that nearly every wizard in the building ran out to investigate, <i>why didn&#39;t the snakes</i>? No job&#39;s that vital, even bar work. Especially not bloody bar work.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Okay...&quot; Wombat looked even more frightened.<br><br>&quot;So we&#39;ve got snakes, we&#39;ve got temptation, we&#39;ve got a weird fruit. You see where I&#39;m going with this, right?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Oh.&quot;<br><br>---<br><br>&quot;I can&#39;t get into the pub,&quot; one of the orbs shrieked. &quot;Something&#39;s blocked it off from me!&quot;<br><br>---<br><br>&quot;Took you long enough, didn&#39;t it, lad?&quot;<br><br>Siobhan spun around to see one of the tree snakes glaring at her, a look of pure loathing in its eyes.<br><br>&quot;I - I&#39;m not-&quot;<br><br>&quot;Why are you so intent on denying who you are? Why do you think people can&#39;t tell? You love answers so much, answer that one, <i>boy</i>.&quot;<br><br>Siobhan felt the tears trickle down the curve of her face. Inside, she felt nothing at all.<br><br>&quot;I&#39;d like to speak to the manager, please.&quot;<br><br>&quot;And what are you gonna say, boy?&quot;<br><br>&quot;The only thing.&quot;<br><br>---<br><br>Purple spun in mad, electric circles above the Princes Arcade, trying to cast a spell, any spell.<br><br>&quot;SIOBHAN!&quot;<br><br>---<br><br>The manager came down, and she was androgynous and dressed well and as beautiful as a dying star. &quot;Now then, little wizard, how can I help you?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Fairest and fallen,&quot; Siobhan said, her voice thick with the effort of not stammering, not giving in, not letting everything win, &quot;greetings and defiance.&quot;</p>

<span class="short-post-author author-tag-for-16">Huinesoron</span>

          <a href="#post-172680">Link to this</a>
        <div class="post-body">
            <p>When I think of the books I like to reread, I find I can usually characterise <i>why</i> very quickly. J.R.R. Tolkien&#39;s <u>Lord of the Rings</u> is deep, with worlds of detail under every paragraph. Megan Whalen Turner&#39;s <u>Queen&#39;s Thief</u> series is incredibly clever. Rosemary Sutcliff&#39;s <u>Eagle of the Ninth</u> sequence is rich in history. Aaron Allston&#39;s <u>X-Wing</u> books are just ridiculously funny. And Diane Duane&#39;s <u>Young Wizards</u> series is absolutely bright with hope.<br><br>I mean that fairly literally. Unlike most fiction involving fighting an Enemy, almost all of YW takes place in the daytime, or otherwise in the light. Light, and bringing light to dark places, is a constant theme throughout the books - Nita and Kit&#39;s wands of choice are moonlight-soaked rowan and noon-forged steel, for instance, and two of the first three books include pivotal scenes where light is used to defeat the Lone Power.<br><br>This isn&#39;t to say that they&#39;re sheer fluff - Diane establishes early on that <i>sacrifice</i> is necessary to achieve victory - but even there, the light-bringing theme continues. I could name at least six or seven characters who give up everything to bring literal light in and against the darkness - and yes, it&#39;s heartbreaking, but it&#39;s also worthwhile.<br><br>Diane&#39;s hopeful approach to the series is also reflected in other ways. In the other four series I listed, one way or another the characters&#39; goal is <b>concealment</b>. Frodo and Sam want to sneak into Mordor. Wraith Squadron want to trick the Empire. In all of those books, being spotted is a failure, and confronting the enemy directly an act of desperation.<br><br>Not so in <u>Young Wizards</u>. The constant message, shown through the characters&#39; actions in every book, is that to turn back evil you have to <b>stand up</b> to it. Nita, Kit and their friends and family aren&#39;t trying to work around the Lone Power, to pull off their goals without drawing Its attention - they&#39;re trying to face It. Yes, they need to prepare the ground first, and yes, they may stay stealthy for a while during the preparation - but ultimately, they draw their circles, stand forward, and declare their greetings and their defiance.<br><br>It&#39;s a very different worldview to the one I usually read, so when I want to read something that puts a heartfelt smile on my face - when I want to remember that even when sacrifice is necessary, &quot;there&#39;s always Timeheart&quot; - when, in fact, I just want to feel <b>better</b> about the world - the <u>Young Wizards</u> series is where I turn.<br><br>hS<br><br><i>&quot;He forgot the high-energy radiation again.&quot;<br><br>&quot;He always does.&quot;</i></p>

            <p>Having tried a couple of impressionistic diagrams in the first thread, I thought it was time to step it up a bit. So, taking inspiration from Arabic and Georgian scripts, plus a bit of the Cherokee syllabary, I cobbled together a &#39;Speechesque&#39; alphabet.<br><br>Yup.<br><br>Now, obviously the writing system is only half of the deal, and I didn&#39;t exactly feel up to inventing a language too. So what follows is a translated spell circle - the words are all in English, but in a curlier alphabet. (English orthography has been used, too - so the Welsh name &#39;Cafall&#39; has been written &#39;Cafall&#39;, despite being pronounced ~&#39;Cavalth&#39;.)<br><br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/SnrCBP8h.png"><br><br>(<a href="https://imgur.com/SnrCBP8">Larger version</a>)<br><br>The whole spell (this is the one cast by Jacob and Lise to feed Bran power and banish the Afanc) is a single unbroken line, read counterclockwise around each circle in turn. Most of the writing is alphabetical text, but there&#39;s also a sprinkling of unique symbols in there - the upper-left circle (Bran&#39;s name) includes prominently both the dragon-sword &#39;Pendragon&#39; and the infinity &#39;wizardry&#39;. You can also find &#39;Pendragon&#39; in the outer circle (over on the left), and the related three-symbol concept &#39;Wales&#39; facing it on the right (the dragon there is the centre).<br><br>I did my best to make the image match the story. I wrote about how weird Jacob found Will&#39;s and Bran&#39;s names, and the diagram bears that out. Lise&#39;s and Jacob&#39;s names (bottom left and right) follow the same pattern as each other, differing only in the details. Will&#39;s (top right) starts dropping details, replacing his entire &#39;Present&#39; chord with a quartered circle (that seems to kind of contain the symbol for magic). Bran&#39;s name not only contains the name of Wizardry itself (deeply unnerving, if you&#39;re a wizard), but also has <i>two</i> Future chords - one of which crosses his Past chord.<br><br>Finally: the spell reads counterclockwise and left-to-right, which means that every word of it is outward-facing. In other words, the spell isn&#39;t designed to be read from the inside (though that&#39;s where the wizard is doing the reading) - it&#39;s meant to be seen from the outside, by the rest of the universe...<br><br>hS<br><br>PS: The full text of the spell reads: &quot;This is a power transference rekwest, target {Bran Davies}, for the purpose of driving from [Llyn Barfog] Afanc Darkborn [Pendragon]-banished Maidenbane. {Lise} as spell originator and power-donor/enactor alongside {Jacob} enacted in [Wales] and calling on the Old [Magic] and the Light: {Will Stanton}, High [Magic] im<s>p</s>lores aid for Bran [Pendragon]! Will you give power?&quot;<br><br>I can&#39;t really write out the names in full because they rely a lot on contextual information from their structure. Jacob&#39;s &#39;past&#39; line, for instance, reads: {mid [Lower Thames] natural [father&#39;s name] 46447.4 [mother&#39;s name] reader male-nonstereotypical past}, which is hardly human-readable. ~hS</p>

            <p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/FGmbuNE.png"><br><br>This is actually an excellent spell. It blends wizardry with the sort of deep knowledge of physics and engineering that most wizards won&#39;t have. It&#39;s also a relatively cheap spell, since the power node (at bottom) indicates that it should take its energy from the volcano itself. (In full, the power circle reads: &quot;Power source: [volcano] at focus of circle - chamber and flow. No power limit to ensure safety.&quot;)<br><br>Unlike Jacob and Lise&#39;s wizardry, this one is stuffed with arguments and persuasion, as well as technical data in the joined circles. They&#39;re not perfect - notably, it simply asserts that the spell won&#39;t hurt anything, without actually addressing the question of how the volcano feels about it (so to speak) - but with a bit of tweaking it could be a first-class spell, and be included in the Manual as a named spell.<br><br>Except for the <i>minor</i> fact that the name is all wrong and so it went very badly.

            <p>I am... definitely playing fast and lose with volcanology and rocketry to make the narrative plausible- but the underlying theory is vaguely sound. I do not recommend trying it at home.<br><br>My imagined outcome is that it would have functioned- not perfectly, some things would have gone badly, some people would have gotten hurt. But it would have been a serviceable solution. Except, of course, when you&#39;re throwing around terms like &quot;no power limits&quot; and &quot;cubic kilometers of rock&quot;, you really need to put the right name in the circle.<br><br>And that breezy &quot;oh, nobody will get hurt, it&#39;ll be fine&quot; is so very in keeping with the other big theme of the piece!

            <p>First things first: the whole thing is read counterclockwise. In the name specifically, it reads from the point shown at the top, down the left chord, across the base, and back up on the right.<br><br>The name actually starts outside the circle: the last word of the spell leading to it is &#39;James&#39;. This acts as a sort of label, meaning the spell can refer back to it later. I don&#39;t think it&#39;ll be needed here, but it&#39;s best practice.<br><br>On to the name circle proper. I should note that lots of the things I included are based on the parts of High Wizardry where Dairine is giving her computer-Manual Spot all sorts of random information.<br><br>Working down the Past chord, we can read:<br><br>-Mid. Ie, &#39;Middle class&#39;. Dairine actually provides her dad&#39;s income; I&#39;ve pretty much parsed this as &#39;how privileged are you?&#39;<br>-A symbol resembling the Space Needle. This is a birthplace marker, indicating Seattle (I guessed); Dairine gives birthplace.<br>-&#39;Natural&#39;, ie natural-born. This could also be what Kaitlyn insisted I list as &#39;untimely&#39; (ie, ripped untimely), or I guess adoption. This is here to fill space, honestly.<br>-The big tree-between-claws thing has father&#39;s name on the right claw, mother&#39;s on the left. Well... technically this just says &#39;father&#39; and &#39;mother&#39;. ^_^ The tree gives the Julian Day of your birth to 1dp. In theory the relative heights of the claws say something about your relationship with your parents, but I didn&#39;t use that. Dairine needed both parents&#39; names, plus date and time of birth; the JD system has been used in recent books.<br>-&#39;Reader&#39;. All wizards are likely to have this; it means what it says.<br>-A single peak for &#39;male&#39;; &#39;female&#39; has a loop on the top. Notably absent is an internal loop, the size and angularity of which indicates how different you are from the stereotypical version of your sex; &#39;James&#39; is in pretty strong denial, so insists &#39;he&#39; is 100% male in every way. (Whether this marker indicates sex or gender, and what that even means, is very much open to debate among wizards.)<br>-Finally, a subsidiary childhood interest. I&#39;ve put &#39;code&#39; here, based on my knowledge of you.<br><br>Now we&#39;re onto the Present line.<br><br>-&#39;Spring&#39;. This is nominally the fAvourite colour space (Dairine again), but is also a marker of what sort of environment you prefer. I based this on the story.<br>-A symbol for a primary interest, with a clarifying word. I&#39;ve gone for &#39;tree&#39; here based on the story, though it would be equally valid to have something tech related.<br>-&#39;Friendly&#39;. How outgoing you are. Both Dairine and Nita actually list best friends, but I&#39;ve generalised.<br>-The big spiral is common to all wizards, and it&#39;s about reading. The first curve gives ths number of books you read weekly, or daily if you&#39;re a big reader. BAsed on your age, I put one a week.<br>--The inner spiral gives subjects. Handily, you told us one of these, so I was able to use &#39;adventure&#39;, plus &#39;science&#39;. (I think Dair gives the last book she read.) Theoretically the exact shape of the spiral says something, but... nah.<br>-&#39;Bookstore&#39;. This is &#39;where do you like to spend time&#39;.<br>-The little snowglobe is how smart you are. It&#39;s a number out of ten, but doesn&#39;t match up with either IQ or test scores. It&#39;s all a bit holistic. (I think Dair has to say what her last grade completed was, something like that.)<br>-Finally, a secondary interest, and you get &#39;tech&#39;. Yeah.<br><br>On to the future! Nearly done.<br><br>-The first half of the line is your sensible, rational life goal. It says &#39;career - technology&#39;, which seemed about right.<br>-The little clawed circle near the centre is for sexuality (ie, Dairine&#39;s &#39;what she thought of boys&#39;). Gay points in the direction of reading; straight points against it. You get to show your relative levels of both, and can leave them low to indicate lack of interest. &#39;James&#39; is insisting on being straight, but the relatively small spike indicates a lack of real conviction.<br>-Finally, we have the secret desire: if you could throw out common sense and do what you really want, what would it be? Once more based on the story, you get &#39;outdoors - nature&#39;; Julia really wanted to be in the arboretum, despite ostensibly being a techie.<br><br>And that&#39;s a wrap! I figure the name includes more or less information depending on the complexity of the spell, but... well, I don&#39;t have infinite space, so I&#39;m sticking with the standard version throughout. ;)<br><br>I don&#39;t believe Diane has ever written a name out, but I figure this would read something like:<br><br>&quot;James, born well of Seattle, natural-born son of (father) and (mother) on (6-digit JD); reader of books, coder of code, spring-lover and tree-lover and friend to many; weekly reader of science and adventure, wise lingerer in bookstores, wielder of tech; worker in technology, appreciator of womanhood, and seeker of nature&#39;s peace.&quot;<br><br>... but probably a bit less corny!<br><br>hS</p>

Well, not now now, just for a while now- Anyway.&quot;</i> It rolled its eyes.<br><br>Despite that confusion, Marisa tried to close her eyes - but couldn&#39;t.<br><br>---<br><br>Marisa had long ago concluded that her reaction to, well, almost <i>anything</i> biology was odd. She didn&#39;t like sneezing, she hated being ill (and had vowed to do what she could so that she <i>wouldn&#39;t</i> get sick in the future, though that had been back in second grade), and her habits and notion of Not Being Seen in tasks of daily hygiene (oddly enough, <i>not</i> including brushing her teeth - dental hygiene was just fine somehow) could have lined her up for an OCD diagnosis, if her parents had ever thought something was up.<br><br>So, when it came to sex, or physical intimacy in general? She could <i>not</i> think about it in those terms. Certainly she would never be able to <i>watch</i> any - reading was more than enough to supplement her fantasies.<br><br>What Marisa was seeing right now? Was some horrible hybrid of reading and watching.<br><br>Words, <i>words</i>, words, words, <i>Words.</i> Only, they weren&#39;t acting like words. Some of them slithered, twined around each other like lovers. Some were, quite literally, exploding. <i>With passion?</i> she thought, surprising and disturbing herself. <br><br>Others had seemed to have conglomerated into <i>shapes</i> - suspiciously people-like shapes. The more Marisa looked - <i>away, away, away!</i> - the more there was to see. And the louder it all became.<br><br><i>&quot;It&#39;s just lust; what&#39;s wrong with that?&quot;</i> the Lone One said dismissively. But Marisa&#39;s mind was not on Its words - even as she kept trying to <i>not</i> see, there was one being she desperately wanted to find.<br><br>The thought of any of this happening to her Manual- to <i>him</i> - made her stomach curdle.<br><br><i>Well, why?</i><br><br>Because it felt Wrong? <br>Because no one else was doing it?<br>Because, even if she knew her own feelings on the subject, she felt she could never, ever, know enough to mitigate the existence of <i>this?</i> What seemed like the default, what love inevitably led to?<br><br>There was a shudder throughout the landscape, shattering her possibly-circular thoughts - and she turned and there was a glowing-bright <i>presence</i>, suddenly there.<br><br>For her. <i>To do what?</i> she thought, in growing horror.<br><br>And then something clicked into place, and she realized she didn&#39;t <i>have</i> to be passive about all this, to just stand there and react.<br><br><i>Don&#39;t waste time being afraid!</i> This was her bug, her trial, the thing that always grated on her - would, perhaps, always grate on her. This was the next step to empathy - to <i>not be overwhelmed by it.</i><br><br>She didn&#39;t <i>have</i> to do what everyone else did.<br><br><i>&quot;E</i>NOUGH!&quot;<br><br>The cacophony cut off - all at once she could feel everything focus on her. Even the Lone Power stood waiting, amusement having turned to shock.<br><br>And her Manual <i>recognized</i> her.<br><br><i>Was that</i> my<i> voice?</i> Marisa had to shake off the moment of awe; she couldn&#39;t afford to waste time.<br><br><i>/First things first: I&#39;m sorry./</i> she said to her Manual, quickly and quietly.<br><br><i>/I&#39;m sorry, too./</i> came the reply - which took Marisa by surprise.<br><br><i>/Well, we can both do better now; from now on, I&#39;ll ask questions even when I&#39;m afraid of discussing them./</i><br><br>Somehow, she knew the reply she was getting was in the form of a smile. <i>/I trust you./</i><br><br>The thought went straight to her heart, and warmed it. And with that new strength, she turned back to the Lone Power and said,<br><br>&quot;We&#39;re clearing you <i>out</i> of this place!&quot; <i>What say you that this guy qualifies enough to be a virus?</i> she added silently to her Manual.<br><br><i>/I believe I know what you are getting at./</i> it replied - and grinned.<br><br><i>/Better lay out that diagram, then!/</i><br><br>And just then, because of course the Lone Power wasn&#39;t taking this lying down, the uncleared words around them surged forward to drown them.<br><br>((AN: Yes, another cliffhanger. :V Next part should be the last, though!))</p>

            <p>What they ended up doing was a threefold approach - first step was shielding, then <i>disinfecting</i> the words of the Lone Power&#39;s influence (since just because Marisa didn&#39;t like them didn&#39;t mean she had the right to destroy them!), and then <i>erasing</i> this iteration of the Lone Power from the Net (as on this level of reality, It was just code. Really annoying malevolent code, but still just code).<br><br>So, two spells, with the second spell in two stages.<br><br><i>/I can&#39;t keep the shield running once we start the other spell./</i><br><br>Marisa&#39;s eyes narrowed, but she nodded. <i>When you&#39;re ready.</i><br><br>The shield spell flashed into place, and Marisa had to brace herself while she powered it. As the disturbingly rhythmic <i>thud thud thud</i> of the attacking words resounded about them, Marisa drew up the nerve to ask one more question.<br><br><i>/What happened, yesterday? I mean-/</i> she cut herself off. <i>/You don&#39;t have to tell me or anything. Worst comes to worst you can call it &#39;adult stuff&#39; and I&#39;ll drop it./</i><br><br>Her Manual gave her a funny look. <i>/&#39;Adult stuff&#39;, colloquially, can also apply to subjects considered &#39;boring&#39; - and while what happened out here qualifies for many things, more than a few of them unpleasant,/</i> it shuddered.<br><br><i>/I would not call any of it boring. Later might be a better time to explain, however./</i> It pointed out. Marisa nodded, and smiled.<br><br><i>/All I wanted to know. Thanks. Now, run!/</i> she said, the command that would start the second spell running and kill their shield.<br><br>There was a second flash of light, this one <i>much</i> brighter, and-<br><br>---<br><br>Funny, it still seemed too bright to open her eyes. And she was lying down, now, too; had the spell knocked her flat? And then there was a mysterious beeping noise...<br><br><small>&quot;Marisa? Are you awake?&quot;</small><br><br>&quot;Mooom, I&#39;m tiiired,&quot; Marisa said - then she blinked her eyes open wide.<br><br><i>Was she in the</i> hospital? <br><br>A few quick glances (and, even though she didn&#39;t even try sitting up, some vertigo) later, and she learned that yes, she was in the hospital.<br><br>At least she could talk?<br><br>&quot;Mom, what happened?&quot; Debbie looked as if she wanted to lift her up out of bed and hug her - but there were other people in the room who looked able to prevent just that sort of thing.<br><br>&quot;... You fell out of bed.&quot;<br><br>Marisa just stared.<br><br>&quot;You hit the bedframe hard enough to leave a gash, and then the <i>dresser</i> fell over...&quot; Debbie grit her teeth.<br><br>&quot;If we could get you and your brother separate rooms, we would.&quot;<br><br>Well, that all made more sense, then; Marisa nodded.<br><br>&quot;Soooo, why am I <i>here?</i>&quot; The last time she&#39;d gotten an injury anywhere near as sever, it&#39;d been because she had taken a carpet staple to the knee, and she hadn&#39;t gone to the hospital for <i>that.</i><br><br>Her mom sighed. &quot;Your brother woke up and told us to call 911; when we got here the doctors insisted they treat you <i>here</i> instead of just giving you antibiotics to take at home.&quot; She didn&#39;t sound regretful about that last part, though.<br><br>Marisa thought of something, and her eyes went wide again.<br><br>&quot;Wait, how long have I been out? Have I missed <i>school?</i>&quot;<br><br>Her mom laughed - possibly because she&#39;d said something <i>normal</i> for Marisa instead of anything related to errantry.<br><br>&quot;That&#39;s for your Dad to sort out. Though, I <i>do</i> have some homework for you to look at sometime...&quot;<br><br>Marisa rolled her eyes, something vertigo <i>didn&#39;t</i> prevent.<br><br>Things were going to be just fine.<br><br>(And if, the day Marisa went back to school, she found a familiar program &#39;Ready for Re-installation&#39; in her email, well.<br><br>She was more than happy to open it up. <i>Dai Stiho.</i>)<br><br>((AN: A bit abrupt, I feel, but I managed to put every scene I had already envisioned for this fic in it, so I feel very accomplished~!))</p>

            <p>But on the second read... well, what would you add? Perhaps something about the effects of the first spell, but you&#39;ve already got that in there. Perhaps a piece at the end with what her Ordeal actually achieved, but the parenthetical ending is pretty darn good, so it would have to go before that. Maybe her Speech therapist could show up in the hospital - but what would that actually <i>add</i>? &#39;Well done, Marisa, you have done X and Y&#39; is a bit pointless when X and Y are obvious from the story.

            <p>So it looks like the goal of her Ordeal is to kick the Lone Power off the internet, which is definitely a worthy cause! I&#39;m wondering now what trouble It has been causing (other than writing erotic fanfic, obvs).

            <p>I would say that as more of a negative, except I feel like it was <i>meant</i> to be confusing - that we&#39;re meant to feel as unsettled and disoriented as Marisa is. Towards the end, that definitely takes hold: the Lone Power is insufferable in Its &#39;I know something you don&#39;t know&#39; attitude. (Minor editing point: this section:<br><br><i>She couldn&#39;t move, again. &quot;Ah, ah, aah~&quot; the Lone Power taunted her.<br><br>&quot;Naughty wizard. &amp;c</i><br><br>Would work better with the line-break moved to before the Lone One starts speaking. &#39;She couldn&#39;t move&#39; is about Marisa, whereas all the speaking goes together on a separate line.)<br><br>I think childish!Lone Power is a hoot; it&#39;s not as serious as the versions Nita usually encounters, but Nita is a very serious girl. Marisa strikes me as someone who&#39;d be absolutely wound up by someone treating her the way It&#39;s treating her, which is... why It&#39;s doing that.<br><br>The one thing that I feel really falls flat is this line from the Lone Power:<br><br><i>&quot;You know this place; it&#39;s for fun times! ... Not that you&#39;ve been doing your fair share of them, lately.&quot; It leered at her - or sure sounded like it was, at any rate.<br><br>&quot;Or at all, really - you consume a lot more than you produce! And while I can pick up the slack, why should I care? An act of not creation, if you ask me, is an act of furthering entropy!&quot;</i><br><br>I really don&#39;t get what It&#39;s trying to say here. What hasn&#39;t Marisa been doing? The obvious answer is &#39;posting stuff&#39;, but a) the internet is for having fun by consuming what&#39;s there, and b) she&#39;s too young to post on most sites anyway. And what slack is the Lone Power not picking up? Is it saying &#39;I could generate internet funnies if I wanted, but I won&#39;t&#39;? And if so, how is Marisa supposed to take &#39;the devil says It won&#39;t post on the internet&#39; as anything other than a win for humanity?<br><br>I realise it&#39;s just one line, but it really threw me off. So you get comments. ^_^<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Addressing the points in order: Yes to the confusion - I don&#39;t know how I&#39;d move that sectioning line - and I&#39;d always grown up figuring (A)I wasn&#39;t Allowed in the grand scheme of things to even register accounts to leave comments (on deviantArt it would have at least been allowed for me to do so with parental permission) and (B) that not having anything to contribute was a Bad Thing. =P At ten I&#39;d already figured being Only an Observer was both the only thing I <i>could</i> do and meant that I had less value.<br><br>That, and I was trying to put several old berserk buttons in the one chapter - the Lone Power covering all Its options and whatnot. :V</p>

            <p>No, not the convention - we&#39;d both love to go to that but also can&#39;t. The Speech-badfic thing.<br><br>Our compromise conclusion, reconciling the enactive nature of a wizard&#39;s Speech with the fact that accidental misspeakings haven&#39;t in fact filled the universe with rogue spells and dead wizards, is something like this:<br><br>Wizardry is the right to have the universe listen to what you say in its language. When the Speech is used in its enactive mode by a wizard, that&#39;s the equivalent of ringing a bell and summoning it down to pay attention. The universe doesn&#39;t have to do what you say - you might not have enough power, or your spell arguments might not be convincing enough - but it has to listen, and usually <i>something</i> will happen.<br><br>The rest of the time, wizards use the Speech non-enactively (in the simplest reading, this is just &#39;don&#39;t end a statement with the Wizard&#39;s Knot) - but they still have to watch what they say. They&#39;re not <i>compelling</i> the universe to listen - but it might &#39;choose&#39; to do so regardless. That could be based on how hard you meant it (yelling &#39;go away&#39; at someone, for instance), or could just be wizardry being wizardry. It&#39;s not prone to sticking within the boundaries people set for it.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I don&#39;t know the amount of requests to stop, but I think right now blocking on the wiki should be held off, unless this happens once more.<br><br>Classic, please do not excessively post on the board. Before you post something, please ask yourself: Do I need to put this on the board? And, as your last adoption post was not replied to at all, think about what you want your post to do. If you&#39;re asking a question which you think won&#39;t get answered/responded to, and isn&#39;t a very serious one, should you be posting it here on the board? Just be mindful, and respect other boarder&#39;s wishes.</p>

            <p>It <i>could</i> have been an innocent question. So <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=315690;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">I answered it</a> in a relevant thread he&#39;d started on the Board.

Social currency is complex, but in simple terms, it&#39;s the unstated rule that, if you want someone to do something for you, you have to do something of equivalent value for them, too. In this case, you want us to write missions that would please you. Writing a mission is a fairly hefty investment of time and energy, so we&#39;re not going to do it unless we can count on getting something out of it. If we do a thing for you, what, exactly, are you going to do for us? Are you going to give us some enthusiastic conversation about shows <i>we</i> like? Are you going to give comments and concrit on our stories? If you <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=315598;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">tell someone you&#39;re interested in playing a game</a>, are you actually going to engage with them <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=315599;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">when they start it</a>?<br><br>&#39;Cause you haven&#39;t done any of that so far, and the more output you demand without giving us any of the type of input we value, the more irritated we are going to get about it. And, because I feel like I have to say this, a one-line token effort isn&#39;t enough when you&#39;re asking for dozens of hours and thousands of words in return. You&#39;re only going get the equivalent of what you give.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Please don&#39;t multi-post every topic you wish to discuss on the Board in separate threads. I speak from experience when I say that it clutters up the front page and pushes more important threads down and out of view, and in some cases off the front page altogether. If you wish to talk about multiple topics, either put them all in a single post, or reply to the previous post you made to keep everything on a single thread.<br><br>With that being said, the only mini-Boulder I&#39;ve adopted is Indania, which was technically the first of, oh, almost two-score little quasi-sentient rocks from my second published mission. As a general rule, if I discover a new species of mini, I only adopt the first ever instance of said mini, so crystal skoal, being neck-and-nonexistent-neck with ndiana jones for the second instance, kinda lost out on that dubious honor. Considering that nobody else as far as I know has adopted any other mini-Boulder except that coprolite one that was given away during the 2015 New Year&#39;s Gift Exchange (I think firemagic&#39;s Ari received it), that means crystal skoal is technically up for grabs. So congrats, you now own a little round rock!<br><br>I&#39;m not sure who is responsible for the ownership/discovery of the other two minis, but I guess you can talk it over with those people.</p>

            <p>&quot;A Mighty Demon Slayer Grooms Some Ponies&quot; was a good one. I say was because the author dropped the ball at the end and had to delete the chapter.

            <p>Call me Snowy. Some years ago -- never mind how long precisely (primarily because I do not remember how long precisely) -- I came to the Board and hung around for a few months before becoming distracted by college and vanishing.<br><br>(I am now done parodying Moby Dick.)<br><br>A few weeks ago, my roommate made some comment about fanfiction which had the unfortunate effect of reminding me that That Series exists (her description of my face slowly twisting into a look of abject horror was a thing to hear) which in turn had the significantly more fortunate effect of reminding me that the PPC exists. (Me trying to explain it to her was also a thing to hear, primarily because I kept on stumbling across three-letter acronyms that I had to stop and explain, such as PPC, CAD, OFU, and so on and so forth.)<br><br>Naturally I immediately looked up a mission and had a great time reading it, and since then I&#39;ve been lurking occasionally around the Board and the Wiki, gathering up the courage to rejoin the community. A lot&#39;s changed for me; I&#39;m now the proud owner of a certificate of computer graphics and in eight days I will be the somewhat less proud owner of a BA in English. (Why the less proud, you ask? Well, primarily it&#39;s because I&#39;ve decided that one of the greatest enemies of good creative writing is higher education. I spent three years learning college level English and now I shall have to spend some time unlearning it.)<br><br>I&#39;m eager to get back into the community again! If memory serves it&#39;s a healthy, respectful, and fun community and those, I&#39;ve found, are hard to come by.</p>

            <p>My sincerest thanks for the bolter, and I shall take the Splot, though I won&#39;t drink it immediately. Who knows, it might come in handy later!<br><br>Ah, fandoms. Tolkien, Chronicles of Narnia, Star Wars, Tolkien, Redwall, Tolkien, Tolkien again for good measure, the MCU (not Marvel in general -- I&#39;ve read some comics but not enough to risk fanfiction of any sort yet), Tolkien, a bit of Doctor Who (while I&#39;ve written fanfiction, I&#39;m not familiar enough with the canon to publish it), and most recently the Elder Scrolls. And Tolkien.<br><br>I love writing and reading. They&#39;re my absolute favorite things to do. Page layout comes as a close second; there&#39;s a little rush of satisfaction to be had from taking words and making them look good. I enjoy other kinds of art as well, though I&#39;m really just passable at most of them.<br><br>My ambition is to be an editor of fiction; I want to help people tell good stories well. I&#39;m loud, but not necessarily a jerk; crazy, but not necessarily stupid; and stubborn, but not necessarily obstinate (though it would be wrong to say I don&#39;t stray into the more negative traits at times). I&#39;m the sort of person who quacks like a duck just to see how people react. Sometimes I quack like a duck just because I want to quack like a duck. And sometimes I type three sentences in a row that contain the phrase &quot;quack like a duck&quot; just because it feels funny to move my fingers that way.</p>

Okay, wow. Where do I begin with this?<br><br>I guess I&#39;ll start with the pacing. I was very worried going into this movie that with so many characters to juggle, there would be massive pacing issues. Not once did I feel like that was a problem; though there were obviously some characters who got pushed to the sidelines, there was enough of switching around between the different subplots to give the major players enough screen time to feel like what they were doing mattered. The fact that the writers and editors were able to make a nearly three hour movie feel like an hour and a half is a testament to how well they were able to pull this off.<br><br>The villain, Thanos, was also surprisingly well-developed for a Marvel villain. His motive is simple: He wants to eradicate half of all life in the universe so the remaining life can flourish without fear of extinction. He doesn&#39;t just want to kill to conquer, or for s--ts and giggles—he does, I believe, feel actual remorse for what he has to do to accomplish what he believes to be a noble goal. A villain believes he is the hero of his own story, and Thanos definitely sees himself as the hero. But when he manages to do just that—wiping out half of all life in the universe—he isn&#39;t triumphant, or gloating. He sits down and watches the sunrise, and thinks about what he had to do to accomplish his goals. His expression wasn&#39;t one of a conquerer triumphant, but of a tired guy who was just glad it was finally over.<br><br>Which brings me to the HOLY F--KING S--T moments of the movie.<br><br><i><b>Everyone dies.</b></i><br><br>Wait, scratch that. Not quite everyone.<br><br>But the Avengers, the Guardians of the Galaxy, everyone we&#39;ve met in the MCU so far—there aren&#39;t a whole lot of good guys left standing. It&#39;s probably easier to say who <i>didn&#39;t</i> die than it would be to say who <i>did</i>. Of those left standing, we have...<br><br>Captain America<br>Iron Man<br>Black Widow<br>Hulk<br>War Machine<br>Rocket Raccoon<br>Thor<br>Shuri<br>Okoye <br>Wong<br>Nebula<br><br><img src="https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5ae22647a342ec2552ce88b8/master/w_690,c_limit/IW-RIP-ALIVE-BETTER.gif"><br><br>Seriously. That&#39;s it. <br><br>Spider-Man is dead. Doctor Strange is dead. Scarlet Witch is dead. Loki, Vision, Falcon, Star Lord, Gamora, Drax, Mantis, Groot, Black Panther, Bucky Barnes, Nick Fury, dead, dead, dead.<br><br>It&#39;s a very, very ballsy move by Marvel, and one I&#39;m incredibly excited to see how they resolve it—because let&#39;s face it, these are characters for a multibillion dollar franchise, and based on comic books to boot, so I don&#39;t expect them to stay dead for long. But with the reality warpers Doctor Strange and Scarlet Witch out of the picture, it&#39;ll be interesting to see how they plan on bringing everyone back.<br><br>Even with this 99% certainty the deaths won&#39;t be final, it was still an emotional gut punch. There was no dramatic death monologues, just confusion before disintegrating into dust. The closest we got to a parting speech was Peter Parker begging for Stark to save him, that he didn&#39;t want to die, and then he simply faded away in Tony&#39;s arms. He was a kid who Tony had tried to send home at the beginning of the movie, and he was just gone. <br><br>The credits were set to very sad and somber music, and the simple title screen in turn disintegrated to dust when it was over. It was a very heavy, very final sort of feel for the ending. And though we got a bittersweet moment of hope where Nick Fury uses his last moments to send a distress call to Captain Marvel... the fact is, for the time being, Earth&#39;s Mightiest Heroes are dead as, well, dust.<br><br>Things are looking very bleak indeed, and I admire the guts it took to take the franchise in that direction.<br><br>Some other, scattered thoughts:<br><br>Loki&#39;s death and the destruction of the Asgard refugee ship right at the very beginning did an excellent job of setting up the tone for the rest of the movie. Though there was some wisecracking from Thor and Loki before s--t went to hell, Loki&#39;s death—for good, this time—made it apparent that this was not going to be a movie where everyone comes out triumphant at the end of the day.<br><br>Thor has a new weapon! It&#39;s... kind of disappointing? Especially after the awesome moment of development he had in <i>Ragnarok</i>: &quot;What are you? Thor, God of Hammers?&quot; But he&#39;s been fighting with a weapon for 1500 years now, and going up against Thanos with unpracticed new powers prooobably isn&#39;t the best idea. So while I&#39;m not a fan, I can understand why.<br><br>Rocket pestering Bucky to sell him his arm was perfect and just about everything I could have asked for. Also, Bruce Banner piloting the Hulkbuster suit (since he was having trouble with summoning the Hulk) was 10/10 squee-y goodness.<br><br>Star Lord. Dammit. The plan to defeat Thanos would have gone off perfectly if it wasn&#39;t for you getting angry and screwing the entire universe over. *sigh*<br><br>Gamora. Oh man... we got to see how Thanos chose her from among the refugees he was planning to slaughter, and how he really did view her as a daughter—and then he murdered her, because in order to access the Soul Stone, he had to sacrifice the thing he loved most. Her disbelief that he loved her enough to consider her the sacrifice was <i>painful</i>, especially after she reminded him of the abuse he subjected her to. And her broken body lying at the base of the cliff... <i>ouch</i>.<br><br>Peter Dinklage shows up playing a dwarf. Typecasting? Not when this dwarf is something like fifteen feet tall. <br><br>Doctor Strange saw exactly one timeline where they defeated Thanos. Was his decision to hand over the Time Stone influenced by this? Did he set some sort of master plan in motion, or was this an instance of the writers handing him the Idiot Ball as well?<br><br>So, to say I was fangirling hard over this movie would be putting it mildly. Marvel wasn&#39;t kidding when they said <i>Infinity War</i> was ambitious—and it certainly delivered.</p>

            <p>And that leaves <i>Avengers: Infinity Wars</i>.  Well.  It was a well-done movie, but I can’t say I necessarily enjoyed it.  Spoilers for <i>Thor: Ragnarok</i> and <i>Avengers: Infinity Wars</i>.<br><br>With all the characters they had to juggle, they did introduce them on-screen in a smart way.  They basically went backwards through the Phase Three movies, so that newer watchers saw the characters they were already familiar with before characters who hadn’t done much recently appeared.  (Although it just occurred to me that Black Panther got saved until last, but that’s probably unavoidable when the final showdown was being saved for Wakanda.)<br><br>Since they apparently felt some weird need to wipe out all of Asgard between this movie and <i>Thor: Ragnarok</i>, we end up losing Loki and Heimdall right at the start.  They were both really cool and popular characters, so I don’t understand why we have to lose them.  I am glad that they at least allowed Loki to demonstrate for once and all that he was truly allied to his brother.  I don’t entirely understand how Heimdall was able to activate the rainbow bridge magic now that the bridge has been destroyed, but I’m not arguing with Bruce Banner getting rescued, so.<br><br>I was worried that the Guardians of the Galaxy wouldn’t fit in well with the rest of the cast, with their stupid potty humor and constant jokes.  Fortunately, the potty humor was left out (so far as I remember), and while they still used a lot of humor, they were notably serioused up compared to their own titles.  Their introduction was flawless, with the “Space” title card and the funky music.  The theater filled with laughter at that point, as we all knew what characters were about to show up.<br><br>Basically all the fight scenes were great.  Every character got at least a little to do.  The alien wolf things in the end didn’t really pose much threat, but the four creepy alien generals who served under Thanos all felt very dangerous, and their defeats were very rewarding.  One weak point was that the Power Stone and Reality Stone felt really weakened compared to their portrayals in <i>Guardians of the Galaxy</i> and <i>Thor: The Dark World</i>.  They had seemed to have potentially deadly powers in those movies, but in this one, Thanos mostly just uses them to knock people backwards.  Maybe he’s just not focused on them closely enough because he’s usually fighting too many combatants at a time, but it feels weird for the two most physically powerful stones to do so little.<br><br>It was cool seeing the Red Skull again.  The MCU has killed off way too many of its villains, so it was nice to see one is still hanging around somewhere, even if he seems beyond the capacity to become a threat again, and might be a little repentant of his past?  It would be interesting for him to interact with Captain America again, though I can’t see any way of that happening.  Actually, I rather hope his spirit has been released to death now that he no longer needs to guard the Soul Stone.  Regardless of his actions during World War II, he’s clearly suffering now, and keeping him around as a wraith can’t seem to serve any narrative purpose.  (Plus, it looks like we’re not getting Hugo Weaving back at all, so.)<br><br>And, here’s the section that really matters.  The ending.  Since seeing the movie, I’ve had Boarders and real life friends alike explain that the characters who disappeared are likely to be resurrected in the next <i>Avengers</i> title.  And uh.  Well.  THEY’D BETTER.  I was furious watching that ending sequence play out.  The entire theater was silent when the credits started to roll.  Just seeing so many characters dropped off the face of the <s>Earth</s> setting with no fanfare, no real goodbye, was just disappointing and frustrating, and certainly not enjoyable.  It doesn’t help that two of my favorite characters, Bucky Barnes and Maria Hill, are gone.  And even worse, I now have to slowly continue watching the tie-in TV shows, knowing that once they reach the same point in the timeline as A:IW, that I have to watch a bunch of the Defenders and S.H.I.E.L.D. agents vanish as well.<br><br>So yeah.  I don’t like seeing the bad guys win.  I’m perfectly happy with the standard good guy ending.  I don’t like thinking that so many characters I love are just gone right now, and I really want to “read ahead” to get them back, plzkthx.<br><br>—doctorlit, Infinitely Warring with his feelings for this movie<br><br>“You aren’t the only one cursed with spoilers, Stark.” “You aren’t the only one cursed with spoilers, Stark.” “You aren’t the only one cursed with spoilers, Stark.”</p>

            <p>This is the second of the Marvel films I watched with my brother this weekend.  Once again working off of notes I took during the movie.  Spoiler warning for <i>Thor: Ragnarok</i>.<br><br>This kind of feels like they decided to throw Thor into the <i>Guardians of the Galaxy</i> setting/tone, and I don&#39;t much like it.  The past Thor movies felt more like a high fantasy sort of tone, especially during the scenes set in Asgard.  <i>Raganarok</i> barely spends any time there, and instead throws Thor more into comic relief sorts of settings and situations, with a lot of aliens with rather silly accents that don&#39;t really fit.  They did do a good job of conveying that change, especially with the opening pop song, but it feels like a pretty lifeless way to send Asgard out of these movies for good.<br><br>I did like that opening scene, as the Ragnarok demon guy (Serta?) with his hordes of generic monsters almost felt like Marvel self-parodying a lot of their previous bad guys.  It&#39;s funny that such a boring and ultimately unthreatening villain is treated so flippantly by the soundtrack, and pushed into a mostly meaningless intro scene.  Of course, the fact that this character actually turns out to be a MacGuffin of sorts to defeat another villain later makes this even funnier.  I liked him using Mjolnir to hold the dragon still as well.  Even though we technically saw him do the same to Loki in the first <i>Thor</i>, it&#39;s somehow even better with a dragon.  And of course, it&#39;s one of Mjolnir&#39;s final acts of combat . . .<br><br>The Actor Who Plays Odin and Whose Name I Should Probably Have Learned By Now Because He&#39;s Really Famous and Really Good looked like he had a really fun time playing Loki!  It does seem kind of weird that when Thor starts overtly threatening &quot;Odin,&quot; no one tries to stop him or even protests.  Then again, Loki was hardly trying to keep up the Odin act at that point, so maybe a lot of Asgardians had figured him out by then, but knew they couldn&#39;t risk going up against Loki?<br><br>I have mixed feelings about Hela.  I find her criticisms of Odin and Asgardian culture to be interesting (I love the stained glass falling away from the ceiling to reveal Odin&#39;s older history—gosh, Phase Three really liked tearing down father figures, didn&#39;t it?), and I really love that her motif is blades, even including her crown.  Her constant barrage of limitless blades is a really cool and threatening fighting style.  But at the same time, she&#39;s set up to be so unstoppably powerful that it&#39;s her combat threat that makes her boring, rather than her personality.  She destroys Mjolnir seconds after appearing on screen, takes out two of the Warriors Three with basically no fanfare, and kills the third after just a tiny amount of fighting him.  I&#39;m glad Lady Sif&#39;s actor was busy filming something else, or we probably would have lost her, too.  I did enjoy seeing Thor and Loki standing together to fight her without any real discussion, after everything Thor had to go through to get Loki to cooperate in <i>Thor: The Dark World</i>.<br><br>I love that Loki finally got his for-real redemption moment at the end, even though he had been ready to betray Thor one last time in the ship dock.  He still made the right decision in the end, and wound up saving his entire people as a result.<br><br>Minor stuff:<br>-When Doctor Strange showed up so early in the beginning, I thought he was going to have a larger role in the movie, but it turned out to be a fairly short sequence.  Oh well.<br>-The Valkyrie&#39;s theme music was really cool.<br>-Despite not liking the more whimsical tone of the film, I was very amused by the Grandmaster having what amounts to a theme park ride to introduce new combatants to his planet, complete with the hilariously out-of-place instrumental cover of &quot;World of Pure Imagination.&quot;<br><br>—doctorlit didn&#39;t take any notes about the Hulk, it seems<br><br>&quot;Why are you handing me the spoiler stick?&quot;  &quot;Why are you handing me the spoiler stick?&quot;  &quot;Why are you handing me the spoiler stick?&quot;  &quot;Why are you handing me the spoiler stick?&quot;  &quot;Why are you handing me the spoiler stick?&quot;</p>

            <p>So my brother made me binge the remaining Phase 3 movies in the Marvel Cinematic Universe yesterday and today, so that we could see  in theaters today, since he&#39;s home from college for the week.  I am even more woefully far behind on the connected tv series, which annoys me, but whatever.  Since I had to watch three movies in a row without time for a review in between, I have pulled a Tomash and taken notes on the two I watched at my parents house.  First up is Spider-Man, or as my brother&#39;s phone autocorrected it while we were texting about movie plans yesterday, &quot;spooderman.&quot;<br><br>Spoiler warnings for <i>Captain America: Civil War</i> and <i>Spider-Man: Homecoming</i>.<br><br>I think I&#39;ll start with the villain.  Firstly, I love that they even used the Vulture for this film, as he really isn&#39;t one of the better-known Spider-Man villains outside of the comics.  He made a good, down-to-earth villain to match Peter Parker&#39;s inexperience, and the generally more mundane setting and tone of the film.  I love that his rise to villainy is fueled by the events of existing films: The Battle of New York, the Triskellion, Ultron in Sokovia.  The physical clean-up efforts are something that tends to get glossed over in superhero films, but this film turns it all into a plot point.  I love the eight-year time jump in the early scenes of the film, because I literally didn&#39;t realize immediately that we were supposed to be looking at the same lab.  Goes to show how so much alien technology can teach a team of construction workers in a manner of years, and how far they can advance that tech themselves.  The line, &quot;They keep making messes, we keep getting rich&quot; ties in with the concept behind the Sokovia Accords in <i>Civil War</i> really well.  You really feel a lot of sympathy for Vulture by the end, too, seeing not only how much he cares for his family (not unusual for villains nowadays), but also the fact that he comes to respect Peter well enough when he learns his identity to not only give him an out, but even to protect his identity after he gets imprisoned.  It shows that villainy was never his goal or focus, and with nothing to be gained from getting revenge on Peter, he just doesn&#39;t.<br><br>I love the opening, and how it leads us from the information we already know about Spider-Man from CA:CW into the more present time period.  First, I loved the light orchestration of the theme song from the old cartoon.  The little flashbacks to the airport showdown in CA:CW, and seeing Happy again after being absent since <i>Iron Man 3</i>, were really cute.  The cell phone, showing how many messages Peter has sent with no response, show not only the passage of time since the airport battle, but also how frustrated he must be feeling by now.  I also liked the montage of simple, straightforward heroics Peter gets up to in Queens, showing his inexperience, and how different the conflicts he encounters are from the things the Avengers deal with.<br><br>I love the fact that after the point where Iron Man takes Peter&#39;s suit away, the tone of the movie completely changes for a while into a more typical teen movie.  It also leads to such a hilarious way for the villain to discover the hero&#39;s identity, overhearing his daughter&#39;s conversation on the drive to prom.<br><br>All throughout the movie, I kept thinking to myself that the quiet girl was absolutely the best character in the movie.  She&#39;s way smart and funny, and very ready to be critical of the world around her.  I didn&#39;t understand why the movie was pairing Peter with Daughter Toombs, but of course the reveal that Best Character is actually &quot;MJ,&quot; though not Mary Jane, explained why they set her up to be so important and likable.<br><br>String of random little things I liked:<br>-All the background characters in the school I felt were very realistic for a high school setting, though the tendency towards negligence in the teaching staff got a little over-the-top at times.<br>-Peter saved the deli owner&#39;s pet cat in addition to the owner himself.<br>-After crawling through his bedroom window onto the ceiling, Peter closed the window behind him with his foot.<br>-The corny Captain America PSAs, and how the teacher acknowledges he&#39;s a wanted criminal at that point.  At least we know he was doing something besides exercising in between being thawed out and the beginning of <i>The Avengers</i>!  (Still his original WWII era costume.)<br>-Iron Man&#39;s comment about the &quot;churro lady&quot; shows that he actually has been paying attention to all of Peter&#39;s communications, just not responding.  I don&#39;t think Peter himself caught this, though.<br><br>And now presenting, some criticism from my brother!  First, this gem:  &quot;It&#39;s too bad people don&#39;t look up in this movie.&quot;  And he&#39;s right.  There are an awful lot of scenes where, yeah, Peter&#39;s on a rooftop, but it&#39;s still very brightly lit, and it seems like other characters really should be able to see him from where they are, but they just . . . don&#39;t.<br><br>Also, some airplane criticism!  (My brother is taking flight training courses in college to become a commercial pilot when he graduates.)  First, the scene where Peter grabs the front of a turbine, and the turbine slips backwards and hangs out the back of the cowling (the tube containing the turbine).  My brother said this doesn&#39;t work, because there should be a metal shaft straight up in the middle of the turbine that connects it to the cowling, and should have blocked it from coming out in one solid chunk like that.  He also said the scene where Peter steers a plane by attaching webbing to the rudder and pulling on it is wrong.  It&#39;s the ailerons attached to the back of the tail that cause horizontal turns.  Turning the rudder would instead have made the plane start to plummet downwards, albeit at a steep angle.<br><br>—doctorlit does whatever a spooderman can<br><br>&quot;I thought you said you didn&#39;t have any spoilers.&quot;  &quot;I thought you said you didn&#39;t have any spoilers.&quot;  &quot;I thought you said you didn&#39;t have any spoilers.&quot;</p>

            <p>I recently watched (spoilers), and I must say, it held up mightily well for an adaptation of a book. I was surprised that they managed to make the dead father&#39;s character arc fit into the limited length of a film, and the fake bird was dead on.</p>

            <p>I thought the actor playing him was so loud and obnoxious with every line, I couldn&#39;t stand it whenever he was on screen.  I much preferred the luxury yacht chase scene (you don&#39;t realize how fast those things can go until the start churning the water!) and the musical interlude/dream sequence.

I have lots of thoughts about this movie, hence why this won&#39;t be a proper review and more of a ramble.<br><br>First off, Thanos is the best Marvel villain ever. Period, end of story. I would have given Loki that title, but he dies a good guy, so it doesn&#39;t really count. About Loki dying, by the way, I really hope it is for good, because it was the perfect end for the character. It had him doing what he always did best: being a trickster, and even though it didn&#39;t work out, it wholly redeemed him (at least, that&#39;s what I think). <br><br>I love how the designated dwarf was actually really big. <br><br>Tom Vaughan-Lawlor as Ebony Maw was the absolute standout of this movie. I loved every single scene he was in. He was just so deliciously sneering and condescending without ever being over the top. The opening of the movie, when it&#39;s basically just him delivering a monologue, was the absolute best opening it could have. It perfectly set the Wagnerian, and (dare I say) poetic tone of the movie. Also, that Wilhelm scream when he dies made me snicker.<br><br>Gamora&#39;s death was a total wtf moment. I think I might have actually said just that in the theater when it happened. :P I... kind of hope she stays dead, honestly. I mean, I love Gamora as much as anybody, but after the emotion of that scene it would just be cheap to bring her back. <br><br>Speaking of wtf moments: Red Skull&#39;s return. That was completely unexpected. I mean, to be fair, when I first watched <i>Captain America: The First Avenger</i> I knew he&#39;d be back eventually, considering that he was just transported across space by the Tesseract, but I just... didn&#39;t expect it here, I don&#39;t know why. Anyway, that was cool.<br><br>The actress for young Gamora was amazing and looked eerily like Zoe Saldana as a small child.<br><br>I have mixed feelings about the Iron Spider suit in this movie. It&#39;s really cool, but it also makes Spider-Man less Spider-Man and more smol!Iron Man. <br><br>I wish Hawkeye had been in this movie. I have no idea where he&#39;d have fit in, but I just really love Hawkeye. <br><br>Shuri did not get half the screen time she deserved. This is a fact.<br><br>I absolutely loved this movie, even though it may not seem like it!<br><br>Not trading lives for victory (a.k.a. the opposite of the many before the few) is an amazing theme, in my opinion, and one that&#39;s all too sorely lacking these days. The means matter just as much as the end goal, and Captain America&#39;s refusal to sacrifice Vision (and the ultimate pointlessness of it when Scarlet Witch actually does it) embodies that perfectly. <br><br>On a much more shallow topic: so many hot guys in the movie, like... <i>testosterone</i>, my God. <br><br>The title dissolving at the end really hit me in the feelnuts. After everything else, it was just too much, but in the very best way. The entire ending sequence was incredible. I did not expect it, I was not prepared, it was devastating, I loved every bit of it while sobbing my eyes out. My immediate reaction after the last scene was &quot;what did I just watch? What was that?&quot; And I&#39;m pretty sure that&#39;s exactly how it&#39;s supposed to feel. Did anyone else get serious <i>Deathly Hallows Part 1</i> vibes at the end? <br><br>Do any of you suppose it&#39;s on purpose that &#39;Thanos&#39; sounds similar to &#39;Thanatos,&#39; the Ancient Greek word for death?<br><br>Last thought, only tangentially related: we hear that Xandar was devastated by Thanos while he was getting the Power Stone. The destruction of the Nova Corps is the origin story for arguably my favorite superhero of all time: Nova. Does this mean that he&#39;ll make an appearance in the upcoming GotG Vol. 3? I really, really hope so. Plus, the Nova Corps member who recruited him from Earth, Rhomann Dey, is actually part of the MCU, as played by John C. Reilly in GotG. I think there&#39;s a very high chance of Nova appearing soon, and I am ridiculously excited for it.<br> <br>Right, that&#39;s it (for now)! Just... go watch this movie, all ye mortals who haven&#39;t. You will not regret it.<br></p>

Red Skull coming back got a gasp out of me—it&#39;s been, what, eleven years since we last saw him? It makes me almost hope he and Cap run into each other in the future, though I can&#39;t really see what storytelling purpose it might serve...<br><br>Ooh! Another thing! Star Lord and Thor getting into a tough-guy showdown. That was some A+ comedy acting on their parts.<br><br>If I had to guess—Loki and Gamora are going to stay dead, because they weren&#39;t killed by the power of the Infinity Gauntlet. Team Free Will—I mean, the survivors&#39;—main priority will be to undo that damage, which is why I think those two deaths are going to stick.</p>

In fact, I think I can predict the way she&#39;ll be restored, since the way Thanos obtained the Mind stone after it got destroyed was by literally turning back time using the Time stone and then nabbing the intact one from the also-intact (at the time) Vision. So there&#39;s a possibility that on a larger scale, tinkering with what the Time Stone can do could literally reverse the deaths of people who weren&#39;t killed by the Gauntlet&#39;s power.<br><br>I think there&#39;s precedent for this as well, seeing as Dr. Strange was able to reverse time to revive Wong in his own debut movie - so chances are that getting the timey-wimey ball to dial it back a couple of notches would be the option our heroes are most likely to go with. My brother also speculated that Thanos himself would be the one to do it given that he has all the Infinity Stones now, though we&#39;ll still have to wait until next year to see whether that will be the case, or if instead the heroes themselves manage to somehow do the time-reversal thing with a little help from a certain Captain Marvel... whose own movie I&#39;m eagerly awaiting if only because it&#39;ll probably provide one last, LAST piece of the puzzle before things all come together.<br><br>At any rate, even though the ending of this movie was Not Okay, I&#39;m very much looking forward to seeing the second part of all this, along with how the hell the surviving Avengers and friends can set right what Thanos screwed up so royally. Though to be fair, they&#39;ll likely succeed to some degree, since there are future movies planned for a lot of the characters who got poofed at the end of this one and I seriously doubt Marvel would close off future box-office opportunities by making their de-existences permanent.</p>

            <p>Hello, all! Ye gods, I can&#39;t believe I&#39;m finally doing this - neither of us can. It&#39;s been ages. But hey, Permission Application is happening one way or another.<br><br>So! Here be the writings of the two of us: <br><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DZU8SugCY1-OrsyqHY2YMaWTi2pdqM9gJIJO__eviiA/edit?usp=sharing">Agents and RC<br></a><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Gcffz8P2ML9gvBr8VTt9TMCXvoy6QKn4UtvnHt-3MtE/edit?usp=sharing">Control Prompt</a> <br><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xQSPLVvHvwVohHYSsPCdKH8OmK-N9T4g6tfPf4YjdV0/edit?usp=sharing">Random Prompt</a><br><br>These were all beta&#39;d by the lovely Neshomeh, who was a huge help, as well as Granz and Thoth. And if there&#39;s someone I have forgotten, I am <i>so</i> sorry - please point it out in a response. I don&#39;t think I have, but human error is a thing and this took a <i>long</i> time. At least in my eyes.<br><br>And here be our chosen first badfic: <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9672094/1/Queen-Of-The-Mobs">Queen of the Mobs, a Minecraft fic.</a> This story is riddled with SPaG errors, from minis to multiple tense shifts within a single sentence. It also has rather a fun Sue to its name - the aforementioned &#39;Queen of the Mobs&#39; - who is related to both Steve and Herobrine, though the latter seems to have been forgotten after about five paragraphs (being generous). Plus a Story of Twu Wuv. <b>With Herobrine.<b></b></b></p>

The bickering over how to move into the RC in the first prompt was fun and gives me a sense these two are going to argue about the &#39;proper&#39; way to do things a lot, especially since it felt like both of them were convinced they were right and their partner was wrong. I liked the second prompt better, though—it showed how they work together, and it was creative in how the agents interacted with the Minecraft world to take down the Sue. And it made me actually laugh in places— <i>“You know, this would be a lot nicer if you were a Ghast.”<br>The brightly-colored Blaze took offense to that, if the number of fireballs focused directly on him was anything to go by.</i> in particular made me giggle.<br><br><b>Badfic?</b><br>Even I&#39;ve heard of this.

            <p>Yesterday I, like any well-adjusted individual, decided to go on the prowl for badfic. As you can probably guess from the title, my haul was rather limited. Sure, there is the poor SpaG and dubious premises, but nothing that really jumps out as fascinatingly bad. This has been a recurring problem for me, and I suspect that it comes from a narrow band of interests which happen to not attract that many fandom-y types.<br><br>I know the solution is likely to read/watch more things. But I&#39;m a lazy bum, and so here I am to solicit opinions. Where and how do you go about looking for badfic? Are there any tricks I&#39;m not getting? I will pay for such information in words of gratitude and smiley faces.<br><br>Thanks in advance,<br><br>1visible.</p>

            <p>The website Television Tropes and Idioms (TvTropes) has seveal pages for fanfic tropes, some of which are staples of badfic. I&#39;ve noticed that the pages &quot;Draco In Leather Pants&quot; and &quot;Ron The Death Eater,&quot; which refer to when a villain is considered good, and also attractive, by the fandom, and when a hero is considered evil by the fandom, respectively, have ever expanding lists of fanfic where characters are ridiculously OOC.</p>

            <p>I mostly look for more... racy fic than your average Sue, but I still look for other things on occasion.<br><br>What I usually do on fanfiction.net is exclude works under 1000 words, sometimes even works under 5000. Most of the things on the Pit are oneshots or just getting started, so it&#39;s hard to tell if they&#39;re going to be bad enough or long enough to be entertaining.<br><br>On AO3, I&#39;ve found it useful to sort fics by how many hits they have. Oddly enough, the things with the most hits can sometimes be the worst fics around. AO3 makes it much easier to find badfic (or goodfic, for that matter) because of their tagging system; once you find a tag that has a lot of terrible things written for it, you can just search for that tag later.<br><br>Beyond that, there&#39;s a lot of reading summaries and hitting that &quot;Next&quot; button at the bottom of the page.</p>

            <p>On the Pit, I set the ratings to &#39;all&#39; and the language to English, which helps make things go a bit quicker. If I&#39;m looking for an OC Sue, I add that filter on as well, but otherwise I just scroll and look for a summary that catches my eye. <br><br>If I&#39;m in the mood for a particular type of badfic, I&#39;ll use the search bar and type in something like &quot;lord potter&#39; or &#39;veela malfoy&#39; and go from there.<br><br>On Quotev, you can&#39;t swing a kneazle without hitting something hilariously bad, so for that site, I just bring popcorn and enjoy the ride.</p>

            <p>Keep pressing &quot;next&quot;. Make sure to go to different sites: for example, in the 40k fandom FF.net tends to have higher-quality content than AO3 in my experience, and other fandoms have it reversed. The larger your fandom, the more likely you are to find something, and the faster you can find it on average.<br></p>

            <p>I know there are a number of us out there who are still kind of afraid of some of the oldbies. I myself will admit to experiencing such fear at times.

            <p>Formerly known as DawnFire, until January 2017 when I decided it was time to switch things up. I joined in January 2013 and, <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=315994;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">as I wrote below</a>, I&#39;d been reading PPC stories for at least 4-6 years before that. Funnily enough, I wasn&#39;t planning to become a Boarder (just wanted to ask about using agents in an outtake for a Mary-Sue parody fic I was writing); instead, I got tempted into writing characters, and, in March, used a chapter of the same M-S parody fic as my Permission piece. In a nice bit of symmetry, I ended up changing my screenname in the same month I joined and becoming a Permission Giver in the same month I got Permission, four years apart. Things can change so much.<br><br>I...admittedly don&#39;t know exactly what to say here, so I&#39;ll just go with random facts that might be interesting. &#39;Zingenmir&#39; is Yiddish (which I&#39;ve been studying for...wow, five years now, if you don&#39;t count an after school club in elementary school). It means &#39;we sing&#39;, or &#39;we are singing&#39;, and should technically be written with a space as it&#39;s two words. &#39;DawnFire&#39;, meanwhile, came from a time when my friend and I thought up some names for cats from the <i>Warriors</i> book series for a game we were playing; funnily enough, she was Dawnfire and I was Brightshadow. I actually used the latter name as a screen name for a bit--made maybe two comments in the Deleterius LJ community back when it was around--but ended up switching to DawnFire (and adding the extra capital letter for aesthetics) for...reasons I couldn&#39;t tell you by now.<br><br>Speaking of Deleterius: don&#39;t know how many of you remember it. It was a sporking community (there&#39;s <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Deleterius">an article</a> on it on the wiki). I&#39;ve actually been very slowly reposting material from there that people happened to save, at deleterius.dreamwidth.org. I, er, need to continue with that at some point. In the meantime, there is some stuff already posted, and I have a lot more to add.<br><br>Like (I think?) a fair number of Boarders, I&#39;m currently a university student. I&#39;ve finally almost finished my first degree. I also really, really like language: I&#39;ve put a fair bit of effort into learning them, and can currently speak, in varying (descending, in fact) levels of fluency, English, Hebrew, French, Yiddish, and German. I&#39;ve wanted to be a fiction writer since I was very small; my parents are also involved in it (my mom writes fiction, my dad writes poetry), and my grandmother wrote various children&#39;s books. It rather runs in the family. I&#39;ve so far been published a tiny bit--a short story in a magazine, and a creative essay (on that same grandmother, actually) in a book. Someday I would love to publish more.<br><br>What else can I say? Well, obviously, I like to talk :) I used to write a ton of <i>Harry Potter</i> fanfiction, most of which didn&#39;t get posted anywhere; going through that gave me a potential drinking game (for other people, I guess, since I don&#39;t really drink much). I have it written out in a document on my laptop. It includes &#39;time travel&#39; (forwards and backwards), &#39;conversation happening in public that really should have waited to happen in private,&#39; and &#39;AU.&#39; I really liked my time travel. In fact, I still do. That and AUs: if you ever want to make me write something, tempting me with an AU idea when I have even a tiny bit of free time and energy will often work. It&#39;s probably part of the reason I love both RPs and things like the Badfic Games and writing things for April Fool&#39;s Day (which I unfortunately missed this year. The Purim RP may still happen at some point, though, albeit <i>very</i> belatedly).<br><br>What else? Well, I&#39;ve got a ton of stories in the process, I <i>adore</i> animals (one of my roommates this year has a <i>dog</i> and it is <i>happy-making</i>), I enjoy crafts like beading and crocheting, and I&#39;ve gotten <i>really</i> into baking (and cooking) this year. (Probably partly just because I&#39;m now responsible for making all my own food and I...really enjoy getting a bit creative). The number of cooking and cooking show videos I watch has similarly gone pretty far up. I&#39;ve somehow only just discovered Julia Child, though I&#39;d heard of her years earlier; apart from her, one of the more interesting cooking channels I&#39;ve found on YouTube is called Townsend &amp; Son (or Sons? Not sure). It&#39;s basically seventeenth century cooking, mostly American and British, done (in costume and with replica instruments and, where possible and applicable, ingredients) by reenactors for reenactors and casual viewers who&#39;d like to try this stuff at home. It&#39;s fascinating.<br><br>And I believe this is where I cut myself off. Have questions? Ask away! I <i>probably</i> won&#39;t talk your ear off quite as much as I have here :)<br><br>~Z<br><br>PS: Want my stories of &#39;aaaaah an oldbie is talking to me&#39;? I don&#39;t remember too many details off the top of my head, but there were definitely some points at the beginning where I was pretty much skipping along grinning and going &#39;wheee I can&#39;t believe this.&#39; Admittedly, a small part of that was because I&#39;d thought there would be maybe three people still using the Board now and again, but a definite part of it was &#39;I grew up reading stories by these people and they shaped my fanfic and writing ideas and and and they&#39;re talking to me! How is this a thing?&#39; Still happens a little sometimes, mostly with the people I haven&#39;t talked to as much. So that&#39;s cool.<br><br>(A similar thing also happened at some point with Scapegrace, and I think also briefly with Iximaz, despite the fact that both joined after I did. But that&#39;s another story. Er, two stories. And I&#39;m going to actually post this now, before I end up checking the length and finding out I&#39;ve written three pages...)</p>

            <p>I guess that&#39;s it, then: I&#39;m officially an oldbie. How odd.<br><br>And yes, PUPPER. He&#39;s amazing. He&#39;s a really sweet dog, who thinks he&#39;s a puppy (or a cat or...look, I called him a zoo once. He has a lot of different animal traits). The one problem with him is that he sheds a lot; other than that, he&#39;s the absolute best of good boys. And it&#39;s not like he can help the shedding.<br><br>As to missions...Partially Kissed Hero. Yup. Since claiming it, I&#39;ve read the whole thing, written something that&#39;s probably an outtake (there was the catharsis of an agent taking House points disguised as a teacher. It was nice to write), noted down a whole bunch of ideas, and have the opening mostly down. I say &#39;mostly&#39; because it&#39;s undergone a small series of rewrites, the most recent of which happened because PKH officially became a Legendary and the dialogue needed to reflect that. So yeah, it&#39;s coming along! It won&#39;t be finished for a while, I expect, but that&#39;s the main mission I&#39;m engaged with right now.<br><br>I also want to rewrite my first ever attempt at a mission (with my Permission agent pair, even), but I expect that&#39;ll go slower since I don&#39;t want to drop PKH by accident. There&#39;s also the mission in which the Sato kids are rescued: Karen DuLay and I are continuing to work on that. It needs an ending and then a reworking, since we started it quite a while ago and it also began life as a Tumblr RP. I still like a good chunk of what we&#39;ve got, though.<br><br>Apart from that, I&#39;ve got several interludes in the works: one just needs me to finish editing it and check in with the betas, another features the Reader and Kozar for the first time in a while, and...I&#39;d swear there&#39;s at least one more floating around that I&#39;m currently working on, but I can&#39;t think what, apart from a slow-moving Plort thing. All of this will show up at some point, anyway.<br><br>Thanks for asking!<br><br>~Z</p>

            <p>You&#39;re ​never really sure, you know? Especially with a character who&#39;s been somewhat inactive for a few years, stories-wise. So, yeah, glad to hear it (and no need to be intimidated or whatever: as people go, I&#39;m generally the nice and friendly type).<br><br>The puppy sends his thanks. He&#39;s...okay, I keep trying to use the wrong language here. Content/satisfied/pleased is roughly what I want here, and that&#39;s what he is with the attention. And you should see him when the dog walker comes: although my roommate knows her through friends, she&#39;d never really visited before, so now the dog thinks of her as *his* friend, the one whose sole purpose in coming here is to give him attention and take him for a nice long walk. The only difference between that and how he sees all other visitors is that the walk is guaranteed (and none of the silly two-leggers who live with him will try to take some of the attention for themselves)!<br><br>And thanks! If I have even half a draft by the time you&#39;ve finished all that (assuming you&#39;re either in the exam period now or going to be soon), I&#39;ll call it a success. My school term is ongoing, so I unfortunately can&#39;t go &quot;ooh, summer--time to write!&quot; and have that work out well. Still, I&#39;m writing it in spare bits of time, so it is moving. And thanks for volunteering! The more betas the better, I expect; beyond that generally being a good thing, this is probably going to be long and something I want to really work very well. Think Cale Sèche, except, you know, a non-cowritten mission. I am intending it to have a good deal of character exploration, though, so that&#39;s another commonality. Also hopefully interesting to more than just me and the two or so people I&#39;ve been running my main ideas by so far.<br><br>Anyway. Good luck with your exams, and enjoy the trip! It sounds like fun. What kind of things does your chorale sing?<br><br>~Z</p>

            <p>I have been since late 2002, when I needed an email address to discuss the upcoming <u>Two Towers</u> movie with a schoolfriend. I joined the PPC on Talk Like a Pirate Day 2003, and you haven&#39;t been able to shake me off since. ^<em>^ I wound up here because someone pointed me at the Board in a review of one of my fics, and quickly made a whole bunch of friends (this was back in the days of Livejournal and MSN Messenger; <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=315969;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">Kaitlyn has discussed what that was like</a>). Ten years ago now, I got married to one of them. ^</em>^ I love this place and the spirit it still has, even if it is filled entirely with newbies (you know... people who joined in 2005 or later!).<br><br>I have a tendency towards deep geekery, of the type that involves mass fanon generation: I have <a href="http://huinesoron.webs.com/Netilardo/index.htm">a whole website</a> devoted to crackpot theories on my primary fandom (Middle-earth, now and forever), and at various times in the past have concocted whole rickety fanon edifices around <i>Harry Potter</i> (the accepted history of North American magic is a classic &#39;written by the victors&#39; scenario, and President Pickles&#39; evil MACUSA refuses to acknowledge the wealth of native and black magic on the continent), <i>Young Wizards</i> (<a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=315906;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">that one&#39;s still going on</a>), and... a whole bunch of other stuff, to be honest. My writings for the PPC are very much the same thing, with the advantage(???) that my crazy theories end up becoming canon.<br><br>When <i>not</i> holding forth on obscure and pointless trivia, I have pretty much the least interesting science job you can imagine: I&#39;m a computer-based chemist specialising in compliance with laws and regulations. Which... pretty much means I spend my time researching and holding forth on obscure and pointless trivia. Funny how that works! :D<br><br>I have trouble coping in large groups or fast-moving situations; that&#39;s one of the reasons for my perennial absence from the various chats. I am famously bad at finishing projects - most of my cowriters leave the PPC before we actually finish anything, and I have one mission that&#39;s still technically ongoing from 2005. I never say anything in ten words if a thousand will do. And when, about a year ago, I needed to email Miss Cam about something, I was <i>exactly</i> as terrified as all of you are around me. ;)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I was letting her know about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuzGMo_FYEA">the OFUM movie trailer</a> we* put together. She was quite pleased with it! But it was still terrifying.<br><br>(*The trailer was written and drawn by me, with voice talent from me and six other Boarders.)<br><br>Now, crazy theories... hmm. My interpretation of the Ilvermorny houses turned out to be different from JRK&#39;s... the one Fantastic Beasts film so far hasn&#39;t explored any of the background stuff there... um, Tolkien isn&#39;t writing much these days... actually, come to think of it, when <i>The Children of Hurin</i> came out I speculated on whether it meant we were going to get all three of the Great Tales. Well, <i>Beren and Luthien</i> came out last year, and <i>The Fall of Gondolin</i> is due in August, so that happened!<br><br>Yeah, most of my theorising is reinterpretations of things that have already happened, not predictions for the future. And my <i>Doctor Who</i> theories have all been wildly off-base.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Me, March this year, speaking of the <i>Hobbit</i> films:<br><br><i>&quot;Also there&#39;s all the money they must have made from the theme park... what? Whaddaya mean there wasn&#39;t one? But... the barrel ride! The thing with the molten gold! DoS was blatantly an advert for their big rollercoasters!&quot;</i><br><br>TheOneRing.net, <a href="http://www.theonering.net/torwp/2018/04/07/104853-there-is-a-cornucopia-of-tolkien-stories-coming-this-year/">April this year</a>:<br><br><i>&quot;And finally, the rumor that has slowly been building up steam online, and now appears to be something to be taken seriously, a Middle-earth theme park. Universal Studios in Florida is looking to build its 4th park and fleshing out which themed lands will occupy the space. Nintendo, Ministry of Magic from Harry Potter, Jurassic World and <b>Middle-earth</b> are all rumored possibilities. Universal already has land purchased in the area near the other parks in Orlando, and two of the mentioned possible lands already exist in their other parks..... The DisneyandMore blog that posted this story is well regarded in knowing what is going on with amusement parks, and Universal began toying with the idea of a Middle-earth land as far back as 2010. ... If this deal is real, expect it to be confirmed soon, part of the deal involves having the park built within 5 years. Fasten your seat belts, keep your hands and arms inside the vehicle and hold onto your hats, it’s going to be a wild ride.&quot;</i><br><br>So there you go! My wildest theory that came (potentially) true.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Yeah, I think the terrifying thing (for some of us, at least) has a little bit to do with Being A Fan.

            <p>-The Newbies missions aren&#39;t actually finished! I have Lou and Nar&#39;s final mission in a half-completed state. I started it back in &#39;07, and last touched it in... stars, 2014, maybe?<br><br>-There was a... two, three year gap in the middle of <i>The Reorganisation</i>, during which my cowriter left. When I came back to it, I had to cobble together the whole thing by myself. If you read it, you&#39;ll find that almost every plot thread was set into motion by the end of chapter 6; everything after that was me trying to tie things up.<br><br>-Swan&#39;s Egg was a <i>nightmare</i>. The DIO part was heavily rewritten following backlash on the Board, and the final part with people receiving the Message was originally going to be a cowrite - except I was too secretive, and once they found out what I was asking them to write none of my cowriters wanted to do it any more. That trilogy is definitely the biggest crash-and-burn I&#39;ve had in my time writing.<br><br>From your end of time, it looks like I just effortlessly built a plinth on which to sit in my glory, or whatever metaphor floats your walnut.

            <p>The thing is, I&#39;ve used asterisks for actions as long as I can remember. I even wrote it on paper when I was in the third grade. And that was long before I actually  was active online. It was after we got broadband, though (when I was really young, I remember my dad refusing to allow my brother to use the internet because he eas expecting phone calls. And the computer system ran OS9. It is so weird to me that I can remember that...).<br><br>So I guess my question to myself is this: where the heck did I get it from?</p>

            <p>I joined in January of 2010 and got Permission before the prompt system came into effect, so it&#39;s been a while, I guess. I am pretty busy most of the time, but have been trying to check the Board semi-regularly lately. <br><br>I have three kids. The oldest is probably older than a lot of people here, which is kind of freaky. He&#39;s graduating high school in about three weeks, and his Quizbowl team just won their third straight state championship. He gets to go to Nationals again at the end of the month. <br><br>My little Doomsprout will be ten in June. (I know some of you remember when he was just a little Sprout.) He&#39;s into musical theater (children&#39;s program) now, and just finished Treasure Island. I homeschool him and ferry him to various appointments. <br><br>I spend most of my online time on AO3. I&#39;ve got some Haven fanfic on there. Heed the warnings if you decide to look me up. I play a lot of video games including Fallout New Vegas, 3, and 4. Dragon Age Origins, and just picked up the Deus Ex: Mankind Divided earlier this year. Skyrim in the past, but let the Eldest have it for now. I watch Warcabbage play things like Far Cry and Resident Evil. I like reading Origins fanfic, and might eventually get around to posting the fic I wrote for it. Maybe. <br><br>I&#39;m a big Marvel fan, MCU and as much as I can get caught up on of the comics. I like NCIS, Stargate, Criminal Minds, and DCTV shows (I&#39;m only about halfway caught up on them, though). Trollhunters, How to Train Your Dragon, Futurama, My concentration is bad (autoimmune disease) so I don&#39;t watch plot heavy things as often anymore. <br><br>It&#39;s really cutting into my reading, too. I have read multiple Hank the Cowdog books this year. The Sprout requires a chapter read to him as part of his bedtime routine. I talked him into Treasure Island in honor of his play, so a real book, yay!<br><br>Other stuff about me: I make hats on round knitting looms, paint little wooden toys, and complete shoddy carpentry projects (when my joints cooperate). I made a Hoppit Hole for the rabbit the Sprout wants to get. It&#39;s actually not bad for me. I like Pinterest and planning elaborate birthday parties for my kids until they get too big to want them. Futurama for the Sprout this year. The kid has literally watched the entire show (even the movie season) 14 times and is on his 15th round now.<br><br><br>QUESTION: For those who are fresher on Redwall. What do you think of it for a kid? All I think of when I think of Redwall these days is Stormsong&#39;s origin fic, and I can&#39;t remember how dark the real books get. (I know not THAT dark, but he is young socially speaking.)<br><br><br>Any questions for me?</p>

            <p>Oooh, Redwall! My impression from memory is that it&#39;s far more in the line of &quot;showing kids that dragons can be fought&quot; line than it is the &quot;unnecessary GrimDark&quot; line. I think it got the GrimDark reputation because when melodramatic wee cubs turn into melodramatic teenagers*, they revisit their haunts with new tools. There&#39;s battle and sacrifice, but it&#39;s not generally gory, I don&#39;t think.<br><br>Though I&#39;d steer him (and everyone!) away from Redclaw.<br><br>I&#39;m so glad to hear you&#39;re doing well and the Doomsprout and other offspring and Warcabbage as well. And congrats on hopeful new rabbit! They&#39;re pretty great pets.<br><br><br><br><br><br>*This isn&#39;t a callout, or at least only a very little and self-deprecating one. I have always had a flair for the melodramatic. Angsty one-shots for the win!</p>

            <p>I know a little about knitting, but I hadn’t heard of knitting looms! How do they work? <br><br>Also, where did you learn carpentry? I am currently learning more about stage carpentry so I can be a more competent and well-rounded theater tech person, so I’m curious where/how people pick up general carpentry skills. </p>

            <p>I make little things usually. I&#39;ve made a couple of child sized chairs (don&#39;t look too closely at the cut ends of the boards. It, uh, is supposed to be crooked and uneven.) I&#39;ve also done some simple wall shelves and very simple bookshelves. My mom reclaimed her power tools a while ago, so that has slowed me down. I mean seriously, you leave your junk at my house for a decade I think that&#39;s a legit claim I have. I&#39;ve got to knuckle down and buy some of my own. I cannot use a hand saw much.<br><br>The Hoppit Hole there were no plans anywhere, I had to do a lot of thinking. I actually found a hand made wooden box for the base at a thrift shop for cheap. Then I found a piece of wood, did some actual math to figure out the circumference of a half circle of the size of those materials. Used that to figure out how much cover board I needed given that 1x2&#39;s are actually .75 inches wide. I was proud of getting all that right! Then I bought indoor/outdoor carpeting to cover it in green. I wish I could show you a picture. It really turned out good.<br><br>I sometimes use the Ana White site for free woodworking plans. It has to be very simple for me to do it. Anything more complicated I have to get my dad to do with his woodshop type tools. <br><br>For learning, I&#39;d say start very small. Use some hand tools if you can for the feel of it, and be proud of that first crooked whatever you make. Then just keep making stuff. I&#39;ve made a lot of mistakes as I&#39;ve gone along. I like Pinterest and just find ideas for things there.<br><br>For equipment I have a powered drill, tape measure, screwdrivers, hammer, hand saw, and sandpaper. None of that is very expensive. I need to get a jigsaw and a skill saw. If you are buying the cheap pine boards then best to go inside and check each one for knots, splinters, and being warped. Some of them are really no good for anything. Also, most places will cut large pieces like plywood in the store as long as you don&#39;t want anything too complicated. </p>

            <p>I&#39;ve been around since July of 2014, I believe, and may have been reading PPC works for longer than that - I don&#39;t know when I started but I apparently won&#39;t stop anytime soon. My personal definition is that the attendance range for newbies is about one to two years, middlebies would&#39;ve been here from three or so years to around six or seven, and anybody who&#39;s been around longer is an oldbie. I guess the definition is highly subjective, though, so if you guys feel I&#39;m an oldbie by chronological association (I joined not long after Iximaz posted their first mission, and they&#39;ve been given the oldbie hat IIRC), then I suppose I can roll with it.<br><br>At any rate, I&#39;ve been online since 2007, which was way back during my early days in college, so at the time I was just an innocent little... well... one of how many non-canon Skarmory pre-evolutions the Internet has produced. I say this because the first fandom I ever produced artwork for was Pokémon (which still is my biggest fandom today), and fanmade Pokémon specifically where why I joined DeviantArt in the first place - I&#39;d seen some very good &quot;fakemon&quot; artists on dA and thought I&#39;d give it a try. I think I&#39;ve explained my online history since then a few times before, but I gradually expanded to other fandoms including various movies, books, TV shows, manga and anime, and even certain kinks!<br><br>Looking back, getting sucked into fandom at such a young age was both a blessing and a curse, since it allowed me to find friends and common interests at a much faster pace than college life ever could, but at the same time my skin hadn&#39;t yet turned to steel, so to speak. That left me woefully unprepared for the harsh lessons of social interactions online - and believe me, I did get in trouble multiple times both online and off for being a selfish egotistic little bugger, and I have no excuse for those actions. If there&#39;s one good thing that&#39;s come out of it, though, it&#39;s the personality equivalent of Skarmory&#39;s Silver Pokedex entry: <i>&quot;After nesting in bramble bushes, the wings of its chicks grow hard from scratches by thorns.&quot;</i> In other words, the drama I&#39;d accidentally caused and the humiliation I was rightly subjected to in retaliation caused me to wise up and begin to make honest efforts to become a better person. I think my family recognized this as well and the various social events and interactions they chucked me into during my graduate period helped me grow up just as much as my online interactions did. Of course, I do still make slip-ups every now and then, but at the end of the day I also have a better idea of working with how people think and feel.<br><br>Be that as it may, though, it should be obvious why I comprehensively disemboweled the one and only badfic I ever managed to complete for my first mission - it had always been my intent to spork it for my first outing even before I joined the PPC, let alone getting Permission. I understand that it was probably not the smartest move in hindsight and that there were plenty of safer alternatives to use as a jumping off point, but there was a lot of emotional baggage associated with that fic, so from my standpoint, I guess missioning it and exploring the legacy of said mission was the only possible way I could cope. It&#39;s kinda sad that I haven&#39;t been able to pick up that level of investment for any mission I&#39;ve written since then, but I&#39;ve already made it this far with my characters and I&#39;ve got quite a few plans as to where they&#39;ll go in the future. I just need to find the motivation as well as the time away from Real Life things (and many, many other personal projects!) to return to PPC stuff, and hopefully interacting with you guys should help restore that motivation.<br><br>If you want to get to know me in other places aside from the PPC and the Discord, my DeviantArt and Tumblr handle are both SkarmorySilver. I had a Twitter for a short while but it&#39;s DOA, and while I do have both a Spotify, YouTube, and SoundCloud, those are largely for faving and consuming media content rather than producing them, so dA and Tumblr are your best bets. I&#39;ve also shared my Gmail around here before (once again, it&#39;s the same handle as my PPC account) if you want to check me out on Hangouts, and though I don&#39;t use that as often as Discord nowadays, I may drop in every so often to check how some of my chatroom buddies are doing.<br><br>Tl;dr, I talk way too much, have feathers made of knives, and am far too busy with Real Life right now to do much else. Yeah, that&#39;s me. Ask me stuff! :D</p>

            <p>Hello! I am Scapegrace. I write a lot more original fiction than fanfic these days, but I&#39;m still a colossal nerd. My primary fandom these days is probably Worm, a web novel about a bullied teenage girl who has superpowers and eventually saves the world along with a ragtag bunch of misfits she was befriended by. Other fandoms include HP, Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell, Pokémon, Red Dwarf, Overwatch, Doctor Who, early Buffy, XCOM, and more besides.<br><br>My primary interest, however, is in robot combat. I&#39;m an avid follower of the UK live scene and try to keep up with the US stuff. I have watched and devoured every episode of Robot Wars, Battlebots, Robotica, King Of Bots, Clash Bots, and This Is Fighting Robots (the last three are new shows from China). I am obsessed with combat robotics to the same degree that hS is with Tolkien and Ix is with Harry Potter. Does it constitute a fandom? I don&#39;t know. What I DO know is that it&#39;s a huge part of my life.<br><br>...<br><br>It occurs to me that talking about my obsession with murderously violent killer robots is not helping with the &quot;fear not the oldbies&quot; thing. Whoops.</p>

            <p>God Mode Sues tend to be very popular because a lot of sad, lonely, mediocre men on the internet have latched onto this series and think that they can Decisions Good. They cannot. They do not. Their characters compensate for this by being brutally overpowered <i>even by the standards of Worm</i>.<br><br>As for an Entity, well, they&#39;re essentially Suvians already - their power, as it were, is having literally all the powers, and the entire narrative hinges around them. Also they are pretty and gold. =]<br><br>YW crossed over with Worm would be... interesting, to say the least. One imagines that the Entities are a race that the Lone Power really, really got to - they&#39;re a broiling mass of infighting, constantly-hungry alien death monsters that exist in loads of universes at once. Who could ask for better minions? Thus, wizardry has to compete with triggered capes in the fight against the heat death of the universe, and when capes are really bad at working together, that&#39;s a problem.</p>

            <p>Parahuman powers are, at heart, information-gathering tools. However, they predispose the parahuman in question to seek out conflict and participate in it. This is a deliberate act of sabotage on the part of the Entities. It means that cooperation between shard users is much harder work than with civilians. In essence, the Entities are playing poker when the world they&#39;re devouring is playing Exploding Snap, and generally it&#39;s only too late when you find out they&#39;re using a deck with seven aces in it.<br><br>Parahumans would be deeply and immediately suspicious of YW wizards, and wizards would be outright horrified by the way that Earth Bet has gone to rack and ruin in the space of a few decades. Wizards being wizards, though, they&#39;d still try to improve the situation... which is when the Simurgh gets involved. I would be genuinely scared for anyone on Errantry in Earth Bet. You&#39;d need an army of wizards just to fight on even terms!<br><br>Which sounds fun, now that I think about it. =]</p>

            <p>Cool. :D<br><br>Yeah, I joined on January 13, 2013. Something like that. I&#39;d rediscovered the PPC around December 2012--I&#39;d been reading PPC stuff for at least 4-6 years before that (it and assorted associated communities helped shape a lot of my ideas about fanfic and other writing), but December 2012 was when I found out it was still a pretty active community.<br><br>Funnily enough, I wasn&#39;t planning to stay; I just wanted to ask about writing an outtake with PPC agents for the Mary-Sue parody fic I was writing. And then someone asked if I was planning to get Permission, and I started thinking about it, and suddenly I had a bunch of characters forming...and now I&#39;m still here, developing stories and characters and occasionally actually finishing something, getting it through the beta stage, and even posting it. Amazing how plans change.<br><br>~Z</p>

            <p>Certainly don&#39;t feel like it sometimes, but it must be the old age eating away at my memory :p<br><br>So yeah... Hi I&#39;m Novastorme, you won&#39;t see me posting on the board all that much, it&#39;s not because I&#39;m not interested, I just don&#39;t have a massive amount of time on my hands. I will occasionally post writing prompts on the Board (yes, yes I know you&#39;re overdue one I meant to do it yesterday), and they&#39;re meant to be little things that don&#39;t even have to involve your PPC characters if you want. I&#39;m more active on the Discord, although I do mainly lurk there, and then occasionally drop into the conversation (much like I am on the Board just with greater frequency), and I&#39;m always interested in playing games (especially multi-player/co-op ones), so if there&#39;s a game you want to play with/against a Brit, let me know and I&#39;ll see if my laptop can handle it. <br><br>I don&#39;t write a lot, I have got Permission and have got a Prelude for those agents out (and nothing else) although I am currently planning missions for two other teams (when I find badfic for them to mission). When I do write it&#39;s more often than not either a little bit of one of the fanfics that I&#39;ve got planned, or my own original story that has gone through more iterations than I care to remember. I also do quite a bit of online RPing on another forum, and that will occasionally bleed through into here, either with my want to get a D&amp;D group up and running on our Discord (or maybe elsewhere if others want it there), or with some of my agent ideas coming from said RP&#39;s. <br><br>I can&#39;t remember any real embarrassing newbie stuff that I did, although I do remember Nesh saying that I had perhaps the cutest Mini-Aragog in existence, when in my first fanfic I wrote, (which was also a badfic) from before I joined the PPC (and in fact lead me to joining the PPC), I misspelled Hufflepuff to... Hugglepuff.<br><br>Novastorme<br>Who writes a lot and on second though can see why he could be intimidating. </p>

All of that stuff is planned, but in various states of disorganization.<br><br>A large part of the reason none of that stuff is getting done is that I spend a substantial amount of time being a semi-professional Magic: the Gathering player.

            <p>Like Juliette, I&#39;ve been here about 15 years now. I can date how long I&#39;ve definitely known about the PPC to June 2003, anyway, based on my ff.net review history. Probably a bit earlier. I turned 18 that month. I&#39;m 32 now, and I live in Chicago with Phobos, my husband, who is also 32 now. I have a cat named Merlin. He is about 18. <a href="http://smg.photobucket.com/user/Neshomeh/library/Merlin?sort=4&amp;page=1">Behold my cat pics</a> <s>if Photobucket behaves</s>!<br><br>When I was a newbie, I still spent a lot of time RPing on Neopets. <a href="http://starshadowhall.tripod.com/este.html">This</a> was one of my characters. *cringe* Some of the Boarders at the time (I don&#39;t remember who) gave me some good advice on making her less Sueish, such as not having her <i>share a name with one of the Valar</i> for crying out loud. &gt;.&gt; They also gave me some other good language/naming tips, which is why the ones there now aren&#39;t terrible. The PPC was the first place I met people who knew more about Tolkien than I did—like a <i>lot</i> more—and that experience was the beginning of how I learned to be less of an arrogant little tosser. ^<em>^<br><br>The PPC also helped teach me not to hate slash and shipping in general by way of teaching me that <a href="https://www.asexuality.org/">asexuality is a thing</a>. I am definitely demisexual if not ace; how I feel about it varies. I thought everyone else was crazy for being so into all that stuff. Turns out they&#39;re not—and neither was I for not being into it. Go figure! These days, I enjoy reading and writing good shipping of all kinds, and have even written some M/M smut that people liked!<br><br>I didn&#39;t actually write a mission on my own until 2007, because at first I wasn&#39;t sure about the whole Sue-killing thing and I didn&#39;t come up with characters besides my self-insert until 2005, when I started writing <a href="http://starshadowhall.tripod.com/ppc/plotholes/">Supernumerary and Cameo</a> for games of Fill the Plothole (which was totally doing it wrong, but we were bad at telling people &quot;no&quot; back then). I rather quickly realized Cameo was a terrible agent, though, so I was stuck again until Twiggy Papaya recruited Ilraen in 2007 and let me adopt him.<br><br>My earliest contributions to the PPC, around 2004-2005, were the <a href="http://starshadowhall.tripod.com/ppc/gizmo.html">Glossary of Useful Technology</a> and the <a href="http://starshadowhall.tripod.com/ppc/menu.html">Substance Menu 2.0</a>, which NenyaQuende was good enough to link from <a href="http://plotprotectors.tripod.com/handbook/">the PPC Handbook</a>. I also did a lot of work on the &lt;a href=&quot;<a href="http://www.freewebs.com/ppc">http://www.freewebs.com/ppc</a></em>manual/index.htm&quot;&gt;PPC Manual, Second Edition</a> (which seems to be down again as of posting this; dammit Webs). And then the wiki came along and made it all obsolete. So when I have nothing else to do, I work on that instead. {= D<br><br>... I never have nothing else to do. I have too many things to do all the time. And that is why I rarely actually get anything done.<br><br>What else? According to every personality test I&#39;ve ever taken, it is difficult to be more introverted than I am. Occasionally, the effort of making conversation feels so huge that I just drop off the face of the Internet without notice for a week or two at a time. To everyone I ever have left or will leave hanging in e-mail, as a beta, as a co-writer, or anything at all, I apologize.<br><br>I&#39;m pretty sure I&#39;m the original PPC tea nut. I&#39;m just quieter about it.<br><br>Oh, people often wonder about the curly bracket in my emoticons. My favorite TV show of all time is <i>Farscape</i>. I will never stop trying to get people to watch it. My Internet home before the PPC Board was a fansite called Friends and Defenders of Pilot, and we used the curly bracket to represent <a href="http://farscape.wikia.com/wiki/Pilot_(Moya)">Pilot</a>&#39;s carapace. I never stopped. {= )<br><br>Um... yeah! Anything else you want to know?<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve recently acquired more sophisticated tea-making supplies (a teapot that can do lose-leaf), and I&#39;d like my ear talked off about the subject. I&#39;ve found I like the fruit-y teas.

            <p>To get more flavor out of any tea, use more of it. If you try steeping it longer, you&#39;ll eventually hit a point where it&#39;s either a) too bitter if it&#39;s a tannin-containing blend, or b) as strong as it&#39;s ever going to get. Oversteeping is the easiest way to ruin a good pot of tea. Some black and green teas are extremely sensitive (or just harsh) and really only need a minute.<br><br>If your mango peach green tea has chunks of fruit in it, you definitely want to use more than you would with a simple cut leaf tea that will fill your measuring device with less air between the pieces. Because physics. The terminology escapes me.<br><br>With fruit teas, I also recommend adding sweetener to taste—the least amount necessary to heighten the flavor and balance the acidity of the fruit without making your tea taste mostly of sugar/honey/whatever. YMMV.<br><br>With good loose teas, you can probably get more than one steeping out of them. The flavor won&#39;t be as strong the second time, but that&#39;s okay if it&#39;s still a nice flavor.<br><br>The quality of your water will affect the flavor of your tea, so if your tap water is iffy, use a filter device of some sort. This is probably a wise investment anyway. (I should take my own advice on this.)<br><br>What else do you want to know?<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Be sure you are using the correct temperature for whatever tea you are brewing. If it is a fruit tea you have to take note of what tea makes up the base. If the temperature is too low, flavor isn&#39;t well developed, and if it&#39;s too hot, the leaves get damaged. A good guideline is 70 to 80 C for green tea; 80 to 90 C for Oolong if you brew the western way (rolls eyes), about 85 to 95 the Chinese (real) way; and 100 C for red tea. Some sources online may cite slightly different values but this is just a general rule of thumb. Each tea is different.<br><br>P.S. I&#39;m joking about the real/fake thing.</p>

            <p>In all seriousness, yes you could use a thermometer. Once you do it enough, you will get an sort of intuitive sense for where the water is at. A good way without a thermometer is to just look at the water. When the water is churning slightly, not at full boil (that&#39;s actually higher than 100 C), that&#39;s for red tea, if there are small bubbles in the water, but no churning, that&#39;s good for Oolong. If you place your hand a couple of inches above the water and there is some heat and condensation on your palm, that&#39;s good for green tea (but one should wait an extra 20 seconds just in case). But, a thermometer will always be more accurate and you won&#39;t make mistakes with one. </p>

I don&#39;t even know how that happened- although I&#39;m pretty sure I have a lock on the record for longest hiatus for an active (ish) Boarder!<br><br>... So long, in fact, that I&#39;ve got an entirely new self-insert for DoSAT. I should write that scene, new-me meeting old-me.</p>

            <p>If I&#39;ve given off unapproachable vibes, I&#39;d be happy to try and change that. (For all I know, I&#39;ve been doing a decent Tech-Priest impression around here.)<br><br>One thing that&#39;s suddenly seeming like a good idea is to do a bit of an oldbie introduction, so here goes: Hi, I&#39;m Tomash! One of the main things I do around here is helping with technical stuff, like the PPC Board Archives and the T-Board (I did the programming for both of those a while back). I also do programming stuff in real life, and I&#39;ll be starting a Computer Science PhD at the University of Washington in Seattle next fall.<br><br>Media-wise, I tend to like works with sufficiently alien aliens (to pick an example, <i>The Mote in God&#39;s Eye</i> was good stuff, and I&#39;d really like to convince someone else to read the <i>Chanur</i> books at some point). As is probably obvious from recent threads, I&#39;m a <i>Young Wizards</i> fan. I&#39;d definitely also count <i>Harry Potter</i>, the <i>Culture</i> series,<i>Animorphs</i>, and <i>Anathem</i> (which I highly recommend if you think you might be like me) among my fandoms as well. <br><br>I&#39;ve also gotten into tabletop RPGs over the past year by way of the Dark Heresy campaign Mikel is running that used to be on the Discord (we moved to a separate server to avoid spamming everyone with dice rolls so much). That also happens to be how I got tossed into the 40k universe in the first place.<br><br>In random RL-related facts, I have a ham radio license that I haven&#39;t used in a while.<br><br>I&#39;d also like to link <a href="https://technodann.github.io/PPC-board-2.0/archive/2011/02b.html#post-65210">my first post</a>, in which I unironically plugged <i>Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality</i> and misspelled &quot;goodfic&quot;, in order to demonstrate that even the Old Ones started out doing vaguely silly things.<br><br>So, uh, say hi! Ask me things! (In the event you don&#39;t want to do that on the Board, my email, which also works as a Hangouts username, is clickable above.) I&#39;m also open to beta requests (I can mainly promise an earnest attempt to look for typos and small-scale flow issues, though.)<br><br>- Tomash</p>

            <p>This is a cozy little corner of the Internet with a whole bunch of nine and cool people in it.

I can definitely say I&#39;ve made some good friends here.<br><br>The shared PPC universe is also a pretty funny thing and nice to tinker around with occasionally, which helps.<br><br>I haven&#39;t actually gone through and systematically re-read Animorphs, to be honest.

            <p>It is not always the best-written of series, having its share of ridiculous plot points, inconsistencies, and uninspiring prose (especially in the latter half of the series, which is mostly ghostwritten), and there were definitely points in my reading journey where I questioned why I was even bothering. <br><br>I think its biggest flaw for me is that it suffers from a tendency to bring up interesting things - pieces of worldbuilding, perhaps, or overarching ideas about morality - and then fail to make full use of them or explore them further in any depth. On the other hand, this means that there are some interesting ideas explored, and I found the series overall engaging. <br><br>In the end, despite many flaws which are much more evident to me now than they were the first time I encountered the books, I personally am happy with my decision to revisit them. <br></p>

        <div class="post-body">
            <p>So I started graduate school last year. I have a friend, who has become one of my closest friends, and who gets a LOT of the same reactions hS does from people who don&#39;t know him. Fear, awe/respect, and some suspicion of arrogance/condescension. This is for three reasons. <br><br>First, he has an incredibly wide vocabulary. Dude is smarter than anyone I know. People suspect him of using large words and precise language to be a jerk, often not realizing <i>that&#39;s just how he talks</i>. <br><br>He LOVES language, and loves using it, and is <i>incredibly</i> thoughtful in his responses and statements. This often leads to people feeling overwhelmed with how to respond, and slinking away from dosagreements rather than trying to think carefully and craft a response. In arguments with my friend, I often have to tell him, hold up - I need a minute to analyze and get back to you. When he makes long, exhaustively detailed responses, he isn&#39;t trying to shut others down, but the opposite - he&#39;s trying to give their perspective the full attention and care it (and they) deserve(s).<br><br>I&#39;m being deliberately vague about which person I mean, because I do think this is a people being intimidated by communication style thing, but the third reason is that my friend dresses nicely, wears Serious Glasses and a beard, and always looks like he&#39;s Very Seriously and Potentially Angrily disagreeing, even when he&#39;s not at all. <br><br>He combats this impression of himself by being aggressively cheerful, friendly, and also a genuinely kind person whose critique is always intended to be helpful rather than mean. <br><br>Huinesoron does this also, but doesn&#39;t have the option of grinning widely and using a Super Cheerful Tone, which means that even his super-friendly, super-helpful posts scare people, because they&#39;re long and use a certain formality of speech. So I&#39;m at a loss, as I always am when this has come up, for the past thirteen years, for ways to explain to newbies that they should always, always apply the constitution to hS, specifically the part about assuming the best intentions, because, and I cannot stress this enough, <i>he does have the best intentions</i>* and try to have the self-confidence to think through his replies and respond to them honestly and thoughtfully, rather than back away scared.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>* How can you tell the difference between someone who&#39;s an arrogant ill-intentioned person who likes to sound smart, and a well-intentioned person who loves language and words? The person who is your friend and ally will admit when they are wrong, and if asked for more explanation, will cheerfully provide it. I have never seen hS fail to do either.</p>

            <p>I definitely agree that from what I&#39;ve seen, hS writes quite formally, but I&#39;m not sure I&#39;d go so far as to say people have been assuming he has anything but the best intentions. He always comes across to me as someone who just thinks deeply about things and is good at conveying what he means, but the sheer power of his Aura of Mysterious Oldbie-ness (plus the fact that, let&#39;s face it, the things he has worked on are nothing short of legendary in a good way here) makes some people feel that a thread like this would be a good idea.<br><br>I may be wrong. Maybe people have jumped to bad conclusions about Huinesoron a lot. I don&#39;t have the best track record of checking the Board, but that&#39;s just what I&#39;ve seen.<br><br>That said, I think this thread is helping a lot. At least, I&#39;m having a lot of fun learning things about the oldbies, and I&#39;m willing to bet that a lot of other people are, too.</p>
