            <p>So, I&#39;ve been lurking on the Wiki and making teeny little edits every so often, and having seen one of my agents on the front page, I thought back to a Discord conversation that seemed somewhat critical of people simply freely putting agents in the Featured Agents bin with the greenlighting of just a couple of people rather than the whole community. In my case especially it seemed too self-serving and unfair to the community at large. Nobody as far as I&#39;m aware has addressed this since then, though, and it&#39;s especially telling that nobody&#39;s acknowledged the Featured Agent box for months now. Sarah Squall has been on the front page since last <i>year</i>, and I just don&#39;t think having the Featured Agent remain unchanged for as great a length of time as it has would look that good (since it might give the impression that people have been favoring a particular agent for way too long).<br><br>With that being said, I&#39;m opening up this thread for your thoughts on: 1) the prospect of deciding a featured agent by community vote, and 2) how often to change the Featured Agent page. I think for the latter it used to be every month, but with the stagnation of the feature, I think agents even before Sarah have been featured for longer than that. Also, I&#39;d like to know what qualities the community in general could use to justify a nomination for a featured agent, such as what sort of impression they&#39;ve left on readers and audiences or significance in-story. This way we won&#39;t have to put forth suggested agents out of egotistical favoritism, and the people featured going forward can be reliably viewed as a standard of sorts for what both agents and the Boarders writing them should strive to be.<br><br>Obviously, given that I put Sarah on the front page in the first place just so one of my agents could be featured, I&#39;m in a terrible position to nominate anyone at all. But at the very least I hope this discussion can help us as a group think about what it means to be the first character new readers will see once they check out the PPC Wiki for the first time.<br><br>With that I&#39;m done rambling for now, and I really gotta get back to panicking over my urgent work deadline. Let the featured agent discussions begin!</p>

            <p>And not just any birthday—I&#39;m finally turning twenty-one!

We&#39;re having to travel out of state, so that&#39;ll be two nights in a hotel (<i>Fun</i> when you&#39;re recovering, huh?) and after that I&#39;ll likely be pretty out of it. <br><br>But in just a few days, I&#39;ll be finally, <i>finally</i> getting it done.

            <p>Unfortunately this isn&#39;t a prompt. My laptop is not working at the moment, and I don&#39;t have an ETA for it getting fixed. While I do have the family computer to use when I can, I can&#39;t use it regularly and so I may not be able to post a prompt next Monday. If someone wants to come up with one (or two) and post it in my stead, be prepared to do so (but NOT UNTIL NEXT MONDAY), you never know, it may all be back to normal before then.

            <p>“Daggeeeeeeeer!”<br><br>The dragonborn looked up from his bench, adjusting his glasses as he did so. The lamplight gleamed off his bronze scales. “What is it? Can’t you see I’m working?”<br><br>Talia, for her part, had been bent over a workstation opposite her partner until moments before. Now, she was staring at him irritably. “The network’s down. Still. It’s been three days, so would you care to explain what the holdup is?”<br><br>“The <i>holdup</i>, my <i>dear</i> partner, is that I’m not a network engineer. So I had to study up on how the mess that connects us to the mass of chewed gum and duct tape that HQ jokingly calls a network. That was the first day.” Dagger’s tone was tinged with that special indignation of an engineer who had just had his competency questioned.<br><br>“Right,” said Talia. “No, I get that, but what about the other two days? Were you just sitting around doing rude things to yourself?”<br><br>If Dagger could scowl, he would have. As it stood, he just gave it his best approximation. It got the message across, at least. “Nothing of the kind. The next days were spent running new cabling through our RC, because the old wiring was put in when 115200bps was blazing fast.”<br><br>“So what’s left to do?” asked Talia. “Just flip the switch and wire us in.”<br><br>“I was <i>getting</i> to that. The only thing that’s left is putting the ends on the cables. And I can’t do that, so I need you to help.”<br><br>“Why me?”<br><br>Dagger held up his hands. “In case you haven’t noticed, I have claws.”<br><br>“Ooooh… Right.” Talia frowned. “So how do I help?”<br><br>“Do you like slotting small wires into tiny slots?”<br><br>“Not particularly.”<br><br>“Too bad. Get over here and I’ll show you the ropes. Just make sure you don’t miss any slots, and that you get the order right. I’ll be watching to make sure.”<br><br>Talia sighed melodramatically. “No bets on whether my hands will hurt after all this repetitive detail work, I suppose. All right. Let’s get this over with…”<br><br>--<br><br>Talia’s hands did hurt, as she had predicted. Her eyes and head hurt more, though: fine detail work could do that to you. She lay on the cot that passed for her bed in the RC, trying to relax before she got back to any sort of real work. Suddenly, she had a thought. “Hey, Dagger?”<br><br>He gave a grunt.<br><br>“How did a Dragonborn get a degree in Electrical Engineering anyways?”<br><br>Dagger let out a long, slow sigh. “I really, <i>really</i>, don’t want to talk about it.”</p>

            <p>&#39;<b>Are we really, Bingle?</b>&#39; <br><br>&#39;Oh, yes, quite certainly, Finch.

That-s horrid. We can-t have that.</b>&#39;<br><br>&#39;The guilt we will feel, Finch, when we come back to there, eventually!&#39; Bingle wailed, glancing at his watch and backing into his corner of the RC and under the sheets of his bed. <br><br>&#39;<b>I-m burning alive with guilt, myself,</b>&#39; Finch agreed, optical sensor really narrowing hard at this particular page. <br><br>&#39;Yes, yes indeed. We are late. Terribly, terribly late.&#39; <br><br><i>Finch! Bingle! You, you&#39;re late!</i> <br><br>Bingle crumpled out of his bed, spilling the sheets to the floor and smashing his face on a tile.  <br><br><i>Ummm! What are you two doing?</i> Ninetwo was standing in front of the swinging door like a foreign conqueror. <br><br>Finch was a trained veteran in these situations and he immediately charged on the offensive with a pointing actuator. &#39;<b>What the hell are you doing in here? How did you even <i>get</i> in here?</b>&#39; <br><br><i>Well, I-</i> <br><br>&#39;<b>Is that a bloody key?!</b>&#39; Finch pointed down at Ninetwo&#39;s frond, nestled in which was a key to their RC. &#39;<b>Did you unlock - do you have a copy of -</b>&#39; He glared at Bingle. &#39;<b>Did <i>you</i> give her a copy?!</b>&#39; <br><br>&#39;I did no such thing,&#39; Bingle argued from beneath his sheets. <br><br>The door swung open again: &#39;Hrmmm, yeah, guys, we need to go, we&#39;re late.&#39; Anne swayed in, taking in the nooks and crannies of the room. She lazily swung another copy of their RC&#39;s key on her finger. <br><br>&#39;<b>You have one, too?!</b>&#39;<br><br>&#39;Hrm? Oh, yeah, yeah. Bingle gave me a couple.&#39; Finch gazed at her with a red melting rage and she was as solid and untouched as a cliff wall. <br><br>&#39;Did I really do that?&#39; Bingle exclaimed, pulling himself up and glancing at Finch. He made a face like he was being torn in half by an invisible giant. &#39;Oh! I did, yes. Ahah!&#39; <br><br>&#39;<b>Bloody give!</b>&#39; Finch hissed, snatching the keys from Anne and Ninetwo. <br><br><i>Umm. I have a spare, too. I&#39;ll just get that out-</i><br><br>Finch grabbed it out of her frond before she even fished it out of her pocket. <br><br>&#39;<b>Shoo! Out!</b>&#39; and he beat Anne and Ninetwo, stumbling, out of the RC. And he pulled the door shut and hovered right back to his book. <br><br>&#39;<b>A damn shame, Bingle, that we-re late.</b>&#39;<br><br>&#39;Very tragic, yes, Finch,&#39; Bingle agreed, rolling into his bed and shutting his eyes. &#39;But there really wasn&#39;t anything we could do about it.&#39; </p>

            <p>There had been no new missions for an hour and a half, which was extraordinary. The only problem was that the Ironic Overpower was guaranteed to give Edward and Kat a mission within the next few minutes as soon as they started doing something.<br>Kat was currently singing along to “A Whole New World” and Edward had very quickly put his new earplugs in. Kat’s singing was absolutely horrendous.<br>Edward was half-heartedly playing Solitaire with his mind not really on the game. He’d played about five games so far and won zero. The current game was not looking promising. <br>Kat said something, but he couldn’t hear her through the earplugs. He took them out and said, “Sorry, what was that again?”<br>“We should do something.”<br>He nodded but asked, “What? The IO is going to give us a mission as soon as we start!”<br>“Whatever. I’m so bored I think I want a mission.”<br>Kat would probably regret that as soon as they did.<br>“Shall we play a card game?”<br>“I can’t think of any good two-player ones.”<br>“There’s loads of four-player games. Why don’t we play two players each?”<br>That seemed like a sensible suggestion. Edward agreed. He was going to say that cooperation between teams shouldn’t be allowed but decided there was no point – they’d both just cooperate anyway.<br>He suggested that they play Hearts and when Kat agreed gathered up the cards he had been using for Solitaire and began dealing, very quickly. He’d had a lot of practice at dealing cards. Once all fifty-two cards had been dealt he picked up one of the hands and cringed.<br>It was absolutely awful! Seven high clubs, a singleton Queen of Spades… He might as well try to take every card there was with this. His other hand was a lot better and he decided he would try to take all the penalty cards.<br>Kat’s first player played the two of clubs and her second showed off its club void with the Ace of Spades. Edward played the Ace and his second player the six. He took the trick and led his nine of clubs, which looked quite high but was actually his second-lowest club.<br>His other player played the three and Kat’s players played the five and the Ace of Hearts respectively. Edward kept leading clubs for the next five rounds, but by this stage Kat had figured out what he was up to and was refusing to dump any more hearts. <br>He so far had the seven highest hearts, three dumped by Kat’s players and the others by his own player. The King of Spades hadn’t come out yet so he couldn’t lead the Queen. What he could do, on the other hand, was lead diamonds; Kat had used up a lot of hers by dumping them on Edward’s clubs.<br>He led three rounds of diamonds and Kat wasn’t forced to play any more hearts or the King. However, Edward still had the highest remaining heart, which he led to take another trick and three more hearts. Now all he had was a heart and the Queen of Spades. The heart was the highest remaining, but there was no guarantee that he could force out the King. <br>He led the heart, fingers crossed, and his other player played a low spade. As Kat’s first player was about to put down a card…<br>[BEEEEEEEEEEEEP!!!]<br></p>

            <p>As far as I can determine, Kat said both lines in the sequence:<br><i> “Whatever. I’m so bored I think I want a mission.”<br>Kat would probably regret that as soon as they did.<br>“Shall we play a card game?”</i><br><br>Why does this warrant three paragraphs? I would put it all into one:<br><i> “Whatever. I’m so bored I think I want a mission.” Kat would probably regret that as soon as they did.“Shall we play a card game?”</i><br><br>Also, concerning paragraphs, this text would be much easier on the eye if you put extra blank lines between paragraphs, like you can see in the other stories for this prompt. You don’t see this done in print, because there it would waste a lot of paper (so print media have more sophisticated standards, like indenting the first line of each paragraph), but blank lines between paragraphs are a quasi-standard on the web. (Neshomeh already told you this, but you may not have understood what she meant by &quot;double-space between paragraphs&quot;.)<br><br>If I could be talked into playing a game of cards, we apparently would play different games here in Germany. Thus, not recognizing the rules, I can’t be sure which climax this is building up to before we’re cliffhangered by the beeping console. (Edward only wins if he can force out that king? He’s aiming for a total victory, not letting Kat get a single trick?) But I can see the build-up anyway. Well played.<br><br>HG</p>

            <p>The bell rang and the students began packing their things, chattering excitedly. She kept her head down, flinching when she felt Jessica&#39;s elbow jab her in the side as she passed. It could have been an accident, not at all intended to be malicious, but she still didn&#39;t want to risk looking up. If she met Jessica&#39;s eyes, there would be hell to pay, so she focused on packing up her cauldron and books, waiting for the class to file out before she slipped away.<br><br>The other students liked to hang out in the courtyard during their free period, which meant the library would be hers. She limped along the corridor, slowed down with the weight of all her textbooks crammed into her bag.<br><br>She could hear voices up ahead and she flattened herself against the wall, heart pounding, wondering if someone had stayed behind to jump her. Nervously, she peered around the corner, and her racing heart skipped a beat when she realized it was Teddy Lupin talking to Victoire Weasley.<br><br>&quot;So, Hogsmeade is coming up soon,&quot; Teddy said as she began backing down the corridor the way she came. &quot;Want to go with me? We could go to the Three Broomsticks, make a date of it...&quot;<br><br>She didn&#39;t stick around to hear Victoire&#39;s reply. Beautiful, talented, perfect Victoire, who had the most obvious crush on Teddy that of course she would say yes. Who wouldn&#39;t? Jealousy gnawed at her stomach as she pushed aside a tapestry to reveal a hidden staircase. This route would take longer, but at least she wouldn&#39;t have to risk anyone seeing her cry.<br><br>She gave the library a pass and continued up to the seventh floor, to Gryffindor Tower, to her dormitory where she pulled her bed hangings shut and curled up on the quilt, hugging her bag to her chest. Her heart ached from the loneliness. <br><br>Laughter drifted up from the courtyard through the open window. She closed her eyes and listened, glad that for once, nobody was laughing at her.</p>

            <p>Ce’rana of Borune forced herself to focus on the book in her hands one more time as she picked up her pace. The halls of HQ weren’t the most cooperative thing, and neither was the IO; both had tossed her obstacle after obstacle - spider mites in her flowers that she had to take care of before they spread; a chance encounter with another Agent that started with her wandering straight into him and ending with her having to go back and pick up her book again after she’d dropped it; and now, making her even more hopelessly lost every time she glanced up from her book.<br><br>All she wanted was to be able to figure out where in Nedra’s name Rudi’s had gone off to. Alex had promised to get the both of them a non-Cafeteria dinner after yet another horrible mission; all she had to do was meet him there. There was no good reason for her to be late, and she could practically feel each second ticking past.<br><br>The Dryad barely even blinked when she wandered into the wall again, instead forcing herself to look up and turn the corner like a sane individual. She would get nowhere by letting her frustration mount until she broke down crying; if she did that, she’d stop moving, and wasn’t that the key to actually getting anywhere in this cursed place? To keep going forward without paying attention until you somehow wound up where you needed to go?<br><br>Obviously not, if another wall to the face was any indication. Ce’rana allowed herself a moment of pettiness to glare at the wall and kick it before looking around to see where she was supposed to turn. And of course she wasn’t actually at a corner this time - one of the few dead ends in this place. She growled and turned around, determined to pay attention to nothing but the words of her book this time.<br><br>“Rana?” Her partner’s voice called out from behind her. She paused before slowly turning again and looking up at him. It took her a few moments to work out some possible reason for Alex to have been behind her - in a <i>dead end</i>, of all places. It wasn’t like he could have teleported.<br><br>“...please tell me you didn’t go looking for me,” she muttered at last. “Because I do not need finding.”<br><br>Alex crossed his arms and raised an eyebrow at her, even as he leaned to one side… on the door to Rudi’s.<br><br>The tiny agent looked up a little more to take in the sign, the door, and her partner all at once. She blinked. She took a slow, deep breath. Finally, she spoke. “That was <i>not</i> there ten seconds ago.”<br><br>“It’s been right here the whole time.” Alex gave her a knowing grin. “Now, come on. Your raspberry mousse cake is getting cold.” He turned around and slipped back into Rudi’s.<br><br>The Dryad glared at the door for a few moments as it swung shut behind him, mentally daring it to disappear, before opening it again and following her partner to the table in the corner. At least he’d gotten her something nice.</p>

            <p>...of still doing the Purim RP this year. While it feels like ages since Purim actually happened, it&#39;s actually only been about two months, which seems somewhat reasonable. It could work. I think I&#39;ve even done it this late once before.<br><br>The main thing, beyond lack of time for a bit (and also a bunch of different events and so on running when I <i>did</i> have a little time), has been that I&#39;d need to finish both an opening scene (tradition!) and the starting post. Then again, I could probably do that...and it <i>would</i> be nice to keep this going...<br><br>I...seem to be doing this. Look out for it hopefully this week, I guess? At current glance, I basically just need to write a continuation/ending for a short scene and adapt an opening post into existence from the previous years.<br><br>For anyone who doesn&#39;t recognize/remember it: the Purim RP is basically agents, Boarders, you name it dropped into somewhere in HQ for a Purim party. What&#39;s Purim? It&#39;s a Jewish holiday commemorating the events of the Scroll of Esther (basically, an evil plot was foiled and the Jews of Persia and Medea were saved from massacre). Popular activities of the party variety include costumes, a type of cookie called hamantaschen, and optional drinking. There&#39;s more depth to the holiday, but so far that&#39;s the main part that&#39;s shown up in the RP, which, well, it&#39;s an RP of a <i>party</i>, not of people hearing the Scroll read or giving charity or gifts of food and drink to their friends/neighbors...<br><br>Anyway. Yes. I am apparently doing this again. Keep an eye out!<br><br>~Z</p>

            <p>(Long-time lurker posting for the first time - hello!) Recently, I&#39;ve noticed that all of the links to Neshomeh&#39;s Archive appear to be inaccessible, at least on my end, and repeated attempts over the past few days (on both a PC and a mobile device) have produced the same result. I&#39;m unsure if this is a known issue or something that has already been addressed, in which I sincerely apologise, but I feel obliged to bring it to your attentions just in case. If anyone knows of a solution, I would be grateful. <br><br>(Apologies for taking up your time and for my own awkwardness in delivering this message, thank you very much.)</p>

            <p>So, Iximaz has been regaling the Discord with quotes of the worst passages of Xanth lately (glad I only read the first one some years ago), and it decided me to implement that little game, also inspired by another game about prompts posted here, and where people had to guess if they were real or not.<br><br>So, the game: You post a quote/line on this thread, and people have to guess if it&#39;s a line from original fiction, fanfiction or just plain made up. For instance, <br><br>&#39;The King professed no love for the Queen, and governed that temperamental woman with a subtly iron hand that amazed those who had known Iris before her marriage. Yet she thrived under that discipline. Those who knew the King well understood that not only was he a more powerful Magician than she, he was also a stronger person.&#39;<br><br>Is unfortunately very much Original Fiction, Xanth.<br><br>So, I&#39;ll begin with tis one line: &#39;<i>Each artifact was unique, which means there was only one copy in all the simulation.</i>&#39;<br><br>Feel free to post the most outlandish lines you can find or think about.</p>

        <div class="post-body">
            <p>In grand tradition (okay, the grand three-year tradition that eventually ended up skipping last year, just roll with it), the Purim RP is back! It’s the latest Purim RP yet, and that’s saying something, considering last year’s almost happened seven weeks after Purim...this one, meanwhile, clocks in at about two and a half months past the actual holiday. With the completely different holiday of Shavuot (...Feast of Weeks, I think it gets called in English?) happening very soon (Saturday night/Sunday day, as well as Monday in most places).<br><br>If you&#39;re wondering, <i>So what is this Purim thing, anyway?</i> look no further! Or rather, please feel free, but here&#39;s a brief explanation to get you started!<br><br>Purim is a Jewish holiday which is celebrated in the spring. This year, it fell on March 1st (beginning the evening of February 28th--in the Jewish calendar, the day begins and ends at sunset, not midnight. This is why you get things like big Friday night dinners for Shabbat, instead of everything being on Saturday).<br><br>Purim commemorates the salvation of the Jewish people living in Persia and Medea at the time of King Ahasuerus (who is generally identified with Xerxes I). Essentially, Ahasuerus fell out with his first wife, Vashti, and found a new one in Esther, a young Jewish woman. Upon the advice of her uncle-cousin (there&#39;s some debate) Mordechai, who raised her, she hid her religion. This eventually enabled her to defeat the plan of Haman, the king&#39;s adviser who decided to commit mass genocide of the Jewish population via a decree telling the rest of the citizens to get their murder on on a specific day. He got this day by going and having lots cast before him. That&#39;s where the name of the holiday comes from: ‘Purim’ literally means ‘lots.’ The Scroll of Esther, which tells the Purim story, ends with Mordechai and Esther instituting the holiday and its customs (and then a coda about Ahasuerus&#39; new taxes and Mordechai&#39;s status as his new adviser--chapter ten is <i>very short</i>).<br><br><i>Why make an RP out of this holiday?</i> Well, it lends itself very well to RPing. Purim parties are popular in the Real World, and traditions include dressing up--yes, all ages--eating a particular type of cookies called hamantaschen, and (optionally) drinking “until you can’t tell the difference between Haman and Mordechai.” Singing is also frequent, as are ‘Purim spiels’ (little plays retelling the Purim story, often made into musicals, very often performed by kids). The less RP-fitting parts are giving charity, hearing the Scroll of Esther (aka ‘the Megillah’, which...means ‘scroll’) read in the evening and morning, and delivering little gifts of food and drink (often hamantaschen and grape juice as a standard, but they can get <i>wild</i> apparently) to friends and neighbors.<br><br>A quick note: costumes! Sounds a bit like Halloween, yes? Well, the tendency here is not generally towards scary or revealing costumes. Popular choices (especially for children) include characters from the Purim story, though pretty much everything else gets in there too. And yes, some people don’t dress up, or just wear a mask or headband or something odd and remarkable like a straw hat with challah on it (seen, to the best of my memory, on a beloved, aging Holocaust survivor)--but dressing up definitely doesn’t end around the teenage years.<br><br>At any rate: We’re back! And here we go...<br><br>*<br><br><b>As ever, the rules/guidelines are as follows:</b><br><br>-Everyone is welcome. That means new agents, old agents, reluctant agents, enthusiastic agents, agents who wandered in by mistake…everyone. It also means minis, kids, and possibly pets. Free-To-Use Agents are also good.<br><br>-This is newbie-inclusive! While I know some newbies (often depending on just how new they are) have agents they’re thinking about, many other newbies don’t–and, well, this is Purim. It’s a party. Everyone should be able to come! So…everyone includes Boarders, with the condition that you’re incognito! Pretend to be your costumes, pretend to be newly-recruited agents, whatever you like–as long as you remember that the vast majority of PPC HQ’s inhabitants don’t know the Board exists (and would forget if they found out). Of course, this isn’t just for newbies; if you’re not a newbie and you really, really want to, write yourself in! The same rules apply, though. (This doesn&#39;t always happen, but you&#39;re certainly welcome to go for it!)<br><br>-A <b>new reminder</b>: please remember that the Constitution is in effect. If an author (not a character) expresses discomfort with something happening in an interaction with their character, please pay attention even if the thing in question doesn&#39;t bother you.<br><br>-On canon-compliance: this one is up to you. For my part, I take most of what my agents get up to in this RP as canon, to the point of working the occasional reference into various works in progress. Referencing relatively vague details that didn&#39;t make it to the RP but are headcanoned by the author(s) of the characters is probably also something I&#39;ll end up doing eventually--such as, &quot;Did he really get so drunk he started dancing on the tables?&quot; &quot;Oh, he&#39;d barely had anything. He just wanted to re-enact the Green Dragon scene, even though he came dressed as Frodo.&quot; &quot;He did fall off, though, right?&quot; &quot;Yeah, right onto that one agent who came as the Lady Galadriel...&quot; …Anyway, you can call this canon or not (or anything in between) for your agents as you wish! It’s entirely up to you.<br><br>-Have fun! It is Purim, after all, and Purim is a time for celebration. So let’s celebrate!<br><br>*<br><br>*Note: This Purim RP, while RL-wise taking place about two and a half months after March 1st, is in-universe happening at the appropriate time. (Boarders inside the RP can mention time-travel if you like, though.)<br><br>*Oh! <b>Another note:</b> I&#39;m available for <b>questions</b>, especially about anything in this post that isn&#39;t clear enough. I&#39;m all for cultural exchange! I&#39;ll be mostly offline over the weekend, though, so don&#39;t expect immediate answers from me.<br><br>*<br><br><i>And finally...<b>the opener!</b> Also in grand tradition :) Fun fact: the very first one was a multicolored textual invitation.<br><br>Let&#39;s journey now to RC Pie (that&#39;s 2.1459) and the disentanglers that inhabit it to start off the party! Or, in this case, setting out for the party...</i><br><br><br>“You&#39;re going as John Hart <i>again</i>?” Agen_<strong><em>t rolled zir eyes and put down the gun ze was cleaning.<br><br>“What&#39;s wrong with repeating a great costume?” Edgar Sullivan finished buckling his belt and reached for the katana that lay on the kitchen table. Well, what passed for their kitchen, anyway.<br><br>“It makes you seem boring.” Agen</em></strong><em>t stretched and folded zir hands behind zir head. “Hints at a lack of creativity, in fact.”<br><br>Edgar shrugged. “It&#39;s a great costume, it looks good, and I like it. I don’t have any reason not to use it.” He adjusted the belt so that the sheathed katana wouldn’t bump his leg, and reached for something best described as a space pistol.<br><br>“You have a disguise generator,” Agen</em><strong><em>t reminded him. “An RC full of items. A general store! Character replacements to loot—and don&#39;t tell me you don&#39;t do that. I know you. We&#39;ve been partners for nearly four years.”<br><br>Edgar sighed. “I like this one. Anyway, if you’re so into creativity, where’s your costume?”<br><br>Agen</em></strong><em>t shrugged. “I’m wearing it.”<br><br>Edgar eyed zir. “That’s just one of your old suits. Are you going as a SHIELD agent, or something? Because if so, I have something to say to you about creativity.”<br><br>Agen</em><strong><em>t sighed and slid zir sunglasses down over zir blue eyes. “Don’t you see?” Ze spread zir arms wide and wiped most of the expression from zir face. “I’m a newly recruited bit character with practically no personality.”<br><br>Edgar rolled his eyes forcefully. “You’re going as a younger you.” Agen</em></strong><em>t shrugged one shoulder very slightly, and Edgar nodded. “Right, yeah. That thing about creativity? Yours needs work.”<br><br>Agen</em><strong><em>t shrugged again. “At least I haven’t used it as a costume before. And besides...it <i>is</i> a costume now.”<br><br>Relative silence fell, broken only by the shuffle of mini-Luggage feet in the background, until Edgar shook his head.<br><br>“Oh, no. You’re not getting me with the sap. I might be proud and pleased you’re all personed up now, but it’s not going to distract me from the fact that you’re a hypocrite.”<br><br>Agen</em></strong><em>t shrugged. “It was worth a try, wasn’t it? Have you got everything put together now?”<br><br>“Just about,” Edgar said. He picked up the period coat that was one of the biggest parts of the costume, and shrugged into it. “There we go. Tell me you’re not bringing the gun.”<br><br>“Of course I’m not bringing the gun.” Agen</em><strong><em>t pushed the pieces tidily together and wiped off zir hands, before unbuttoning zir suit jacket and pushing it aside to show a different gun in a generic holster. “I’m bringing this one. SHIELD standard issue.”<br><br>Edgar sighed. “Of course you are. Alright—let’s just go. The sooner we leave, the sooner Carrrot and Neinor and the rest can start making a mess.”<br><br>The shuffle of mini-Luggage feet stopped suspiciously. The two disentanglers exchanged glances.<br><br>“I plan to bring back a good supply of cookies this year,” Agen</em></strong><em>t said casually. “I won’t be sharing them with anyone, or anything, that hasn’t been on good behavior since I left, though. I think that sounds reasonable.”<br><br>“Oh, very reasonable,” Edgar said. He grinned at the utter silence in the RC. “Come on—let’s go party. Maybe we’ll even bring back some of the little pita chip things this year...those are <i>very</i> good for sharing…”<br><br>“Extra chocolate hamantaschen,” Agen</em><strong><em>t added. “Those always go quickly. We’d better hurry if we want some.”<br><br>“Good point.”<br><br>They left, grinning at each other once the door had closed behind them.<br><br>“Well, that went well.”<br><br>“There will be some kind of mess when we get back,” Agen</em></strong>_t said. Ze set off down the hallway, pushing zir sunglasses back up. “There always is.”<br><br>“You never know,” Edgar said, and followed his partner. “Maybe today will be the day…”</p>

He tugged on his dress, wondering if he should be trying to cover his leggings.

Indeed, it seemed that, aside from leaving him male, a disguise generator had been used to make him resemble her as closely as possible. He wasn&#39;t sure if he should have gone all-out and changed his gender as well, but then again, he hadn&#39;t chosen his costume. <br><br>The agent lurked around the edges of the party, watching as other people slowly trickled in.

            <p>Charlotte laughed. &quot;It&#39;s not every day you see agents about to throw down. Hopefully we can avoid that today, though? I&#39;m a lot squishier than I used to be, and not very good at fighting, so I&#39;m really not looking to start a fight.&quot;</p>

            <p>&quot;For my sake, as much as anyone else&#39;s.&quot; Tom frowned. &quot;I&#39;m not the best fighter, and I&#39;m pretty sure that &#39;I shall not expose my fellow agents to Lovecraftian abominations from outside reality&#39; is already on The TIANTDATPPC list.

            <p>...and went straight for the hamantaschen.<br><br>&quot;No, I&#39;m serious,&quot; Dawn McKenna said. She was dressed as the Eleventh Doctor, and had been frequently playing with her bowtie, playing with her fez, and gleefully telling her former partner to &quot;Come along, Pond!&quot; since putting the costume on. &quot;Last year I got all of two poppy seed ones. Only the apricot was left by the end, and I didn&#39;t want to make some myself, so that was that. It was sad.&quot;<br><br>&quot;It disappointed you,&quot; T&#39;Zar corrected. She moved surprisingly easily in the short skirt and heeled boots: it was the ginger wig that she occasionally scratched at or pushed carefully out of her face.<br><br>&quot;Well, yeah,&quot; Dawn said. &quot;That&#39;s what I meant, Pond.&quot; She grinned. &quot;This is so much fun!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Better than being Thor last year?&quot; Abaddon asked. In keeping with his frequent Time Lord theme (and, of course, with his friends), he&#39;d come dressed as the Doctor as well. The Thirteenth, specifically.<br><br>Dawn shrugged. &quot;Nah, just different. Ooh, chocolate-poppy seed! How have I never seen that before? And--wait, is that...is that halvah?&quot;<br><br>T&#39;Zar picked one up immediately, smelling it briefly before she took a bite. &quot;It is. It is also...quite pleasant to the taste.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Because you like the stuff,&quot; Abaddon pointed out. His words aside, he took two and ate them in short order. &quot;Not bad!&quot; Continuing down the table to snag a napkin for T&#39;Zar, he managed to bump into someone. &quot;Oh! So sorry...&quot;<br><br>--<br>Hamantaschen are triangular cookies with every filling you could ever think of, by now. Halvah is sweetened, flaky sesame seed paste, and can be a bit of an acquired taste for some. It also comes in many varieties by now.</p>

            <p>Sophie looked up as the group approached. She&#39;d been trying to decide which hamantaschen to start with -- they all looked and smelled <i>very</i> good. At the sight of potential cookie competition approaching she quickly grabbed one in each hand, just to be safe.<br><br>&quot;Hey!&quot; she said. &quot;Nice wig. Not-actually-redheads unite! Heh. Don&#39;t think I&#39;ve met you guys. I&#39;m Sophie!&quot; She held out a hand and then realized that it was full of food, so she stuffed the cookie into her mouth to free it up. &quot;Mmmph!&quot; she said, not caring that it was rude to talk with her mouth full. &quot;Dif if good! Nefer had it before.&quot;</p>

Also, I have never made or eaten most of these, but the photos went over really well when I printed them out and showed them to a class of six-year-olds! I also linked to it in a previous Purim RP&#39;s opening post, possibly that of 2016...so if anyone recognizes it and wouldn&#39;t have found it on their own, mystery solved :)</p>

            <p>As she plugged in her headphones and started up Google Docs, Twistey recalled the high likelihood of disastrous consequences occurring if she&#39;d joined the fun last year. Bull in a china shop, indeed. Over that year, she&#39;d developed a trick of channeling a terrible concept in a hidden way, resulting in something that was not offensive, just vaguely menacing. That was the reason why she could give away the character her thoughts had turned into, because it had been generic to the point of looking like it was related to something else entirely. Which reminded her, she needed to give it away.<br><br>But that didn&#39;t matter now. The Purim party hadn&#39;t even happened, and so no harm was done. Now it had rolled around again, and she was quite prepared this time. She knew some of her agents-to-be were going to go, and she wanted to surprise them a little. But still, she knew she had to keep incognito. Zingenmir&#39;s rules.<br><br>Twistey couldn&#39;t work without music, so she looked through YouTube to see what its suggestions were. Mostly Animusic. She&#39;d gotten back into that a while ago, having loved its music and animation since childhood. Seeing one video, she remembered something she would love to do. &quot;Aha&quot;, she thought, dialed up one of the pre-agents who had decided not to go, and began to write her costume into reality.<br><br>-------<br><br>&quot;Hello! Listen, I finally found a costume for you that you might be able to go in. ...No, you do not have things to do, you&#39;re a semi-fic blip and you&#39;re not an agent yet. ...There&#39;s social anxiety and there&#39;s isolating yourself from everyone because you don&#39;t feel you&#39;re normal. Agents are an interesting bunch, there&#39;s a lot of them who don&#39;t know their parents either. ...Yes. And about the costume, no one has to see your face, hear your voice, or anything like that. I know right, it&#39;s great! ...We&#39;ll communicate with written signs, gestures, and music. First thing we&#39;ll do is ask the host if we can DJ, so it can be that we won&#39;t even have to interact with anyone. Okay, you&#39;re in? Sweet! Put your hair in a wig cap and get a binder if you have one. I have some really cool wearable electronics for us. See ya at my place. Goodbye.&quot;<br><br>-------<br><br>Amber Callahan, no relation to Kitty or any other agent with that last name, was peppering an agent with questions about HQ. When did a typical day start? What tools would she be equipped with for missions? What kind of person could she expect for a partner? The nature of HQ time, the severe underequippedness, and all that only made her more excited. Amber had always had a thirst for adventure. This seemed to worry the agent to no end, but despite the look in their eyes, they smiled and nodded, then continued answering in an even tone of voice.<br><br>The Callahan siblings (Erika, Amber, and Connor, from oldest to youngest) had collectively decided to go as characters who wouldn&#39;t require masks, excessive face paint, or wigs that were a different color than their actual hair, just so that the crowd could get to know what they actually looked like. Connor was immediately recognizable as Ron Weasley, though he&#39;d remarked that he was &quot;too quiet for the part.&quot; Erika had reused a formidable cosplay of Moira from Overwatch that she had saved up to buy, and it looked like she was getting more in character as she got more comfortable. While Moira isn&#39;t really a costume one can ruin Purim with, the younger Callahans would have to keep her in check. Amber herself wore the magnificent blue-and-yellow dress of Mrs. Whatsit from the new &quot;A Wrinkle in Time&quot; movie. Amber&#39;s best friend Miriam had helped her with her makeup and other such things - too bad Miriam hadn&#39;t been able to come. Oh well - Amber had her phone with her, and she could send Miriam all the photos of great cosplay that she could handle.<br><br>Just then, Amber heard a loud sound coming from the entrance. Specifically, a series of notes played on a higher and lower synthesizer. She spun to face the direction the musical noise had come from. Two gleaming, futuristic robots, their fronts covered in large pentagonal buttons that she assumed made the music, glided into the room together and made their way towards the host. Things just got more interesting.<br><br>-------<br><br>The blue Starship Groove robot, presumably male, pulled out a sign reading &quot;Can we DJ?&quot; and showed it to the host. The red one began pressing buttons with one hand and gesturing with the other, first pointing to &quot;her&quot;self, and then making a motion that resembled scratching a disk on a turntable. They waited for a reply.<br><br>-Twistey<br><br>(Here&#39;s a reference for Twistey and the reluctant pre-agent&#39;s costumes):<br><img src="http://www.animusic.com/podcasts/Animusic_Podcast.jpg" alt="http://www.animusic.com/podcasts/Animusic_Podcast.jpg"> </p>
