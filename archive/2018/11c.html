            <p>Hi PPC,<br><br>Do any of you happen to be or know the wonderful, beautiful person I fell in love with during my club presidency of my high school&#39;s literature club? They have been avoiding me lately and I want to find them and show them how much I care. I was looking for literature groups where I might find them and I stumbled upon this one. Please reply quickly - I just can&#39;t be without my love!<br><br>Thanks,<br>Monika<br><br>P.S. If it&#39;s about the other girls in the club, I do apologize for their deletion, but it had to happen.</p>

            <p>This character, Monika, comes off to me as a giggling psychopath. If it hadn&#39;t turned out to be someone RPing, I&#39;d have been telling them in no uncertain terms to leave us and the person they&#39;re stalking across the Internet the hell alone and possibly trying to figure out which authorities we should be contacting. Telling the character to seek mental help instead of continuing their stalking behavior is pretty reasonable, IMO.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Because are we talking about the character, Monika or the person who is behind the screen name? Assuming the former, then yeah. If i was ever in a situation with someone like that character I would advise them to seek mental help. <br><br>But, I don&#39;t think this is the case with this poster. Mostly, because I can tell you exactly who it is (even if I worked it out as I was typing this post). And unless they are a very good at hiding who/what they truly are, they have not come across as a psychopath to me either here on the Board or on Discord before. Initially I thought it was at best, a RP going horribly wrong (which I still hold out hope that it might be) or at worst a troll, designed specifically to aggravate us because of not only the type of character they were &#39;RPing&#39; but also the exact matter which is associated with the &#39;verse the character is from. <br><br>Being who I am, I try to believe in the best of people at first, even online and I&#39;m also willing to play the Devil&#39;s Advocate and in that mindset, I saw Scape&#39;s post not as a suggestion to the character but as a direct attack at the person behind the keyboard, and replied with that mindset in mind. It may not of been right, but it&#39;s what I felt should have been done. <br><br>Novastorme<br><br>P.S To the Boarder who posted as Monika, I know who you are, but I&#39;m not going to reveal just yet unless I&#39;m given a very good reason to. My email is clickable if you want to contact me to help sort things out if there are things to sort out, and I will post on here in your stead if you wish to remain anonymous while this situation is sorted. Be aware however, that this does not mean that I will become a mouthpiece for you to carry, whatever this is on. So do not try it, or my patience.  </p>

            <p>Er, Storme, I also know who it is, and I can&#39;t see any indication that Scape or Nesh were commenting on the poster (who for the record is a Boarder in good standing, anyone who&#39;s concerned) rather than the character they were RPing. I also haven&#39;t seen any indication that the RP is going &#39;horribly wrong&#39; - people are responding to them as the character, who is really disturbing, not as the PPCer, who made a thread tjat got responses.<br><br>Unless there&#39;s been some nasty talk in the chat, I think you&#39;re reading way too much into this.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I think my problem is how I differentiate between Out of Character chat and In Character talk. Given this is a RP I&#39;d expect people to be RPing as character, like Monika and so to be reply as said characters (Agent Rutherford for example), so I read that part of this thread as In Character. When people are talking using their normal Board handles in this thread (if it was a pre-organised RP thing like the Purim RP or something on the T-Board this would be different) I&#39;m reading as if its Out of Character, ie whatever is being said out of character by Scape for example is being directed at the person behind Monika, not Monika themselves. Which, is where my comments and views stem from, because I&#39;m talking Out of Character, to other people Out of Character. <br><br>I guess my point of view is a little different to everyone elses.</p>

We&#39;ve played this sort of game before, a la the mention of Deadpool in the same post. Also, there was that one time the Riddler showed up and ensnared a bunch of Boarders, and I got rescued by Green Lantern—that was good times. ^_^ The Boarders posting as themselves, including Scape, are definitely responding as intended here.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I wrote a story for a small-scale writing competition run by a local publishing outlet called Whirling Chair.

I was one of the winners and got to read the piece at their &quot;Tea, Toast, and Ghosts&quot; evening, as well as receiving a promise that it would be published.

            <p>Something about the Berserker class speaks to me.  It says fear me.  It says I am ripper, tearer, slasher, gouger.  It says that mine is strenght and lust and power.  For that reason, I will start the list of potential Berserkers with:<br><br>- Beowulf: After all, dude ripped a monster&#39;s arm off and beat him with it.  Then he went after that monster&#39;s mom.  Noble Phantasm: I dunno, some guy&#39;s arm, I guess?<br><br>- Anakin Skywalker: This guy killed a bunch of kids because...reasons?  Noble Phantasm: Mask of Vader<br><br>- Pinkie Pie: Do I need to explain this one?  Noble Phantasm: Whatever the hell she wants it to be.<br><br>- Angron, the 12th Primarch: He lives to fight.  He wants nothing else in life.  Noble Phantasm: Lord of the Red Sands<br><br>- Sloth (FMA): Lumbering brute.  Just wants to sleep.  Will beat you senseless if you anger him, but it&#39;s such a pain to move so much.  Noble Phantasm: Ludicrous Speed<br><br>- The Juggernaut (Marvel): Unstoppable is his middle name.  Only suited for breaking rocks with his head, which he is really good at. Noble Phantasm: Unstoppable Force<br><br>That&#39;s a good start to the list.  There are likely more that I can&#39;t think of at the moment.<br><br>-Phobos</p>

            <p>Beowulf&#39;s Noble Phantasm is, surprisingly enough, *not* Grendel&#39;s arm. He does, however, throw his swords away and start wrastling people to death - at least, that&#39;s what he does in Fate/Grand Order. Also, fun fact about Beowulf - he&#39;s actually a very reasonable Berserker, due to his absolutely staggering Madness Enhancement rank of... E-.</p>

I say the whole trope of wishes going wrong only exists because our world doesn&#39;t have magical wishes, so they can only be used in stories to teach lessons that can apply to us. In a world that DOES have real magical wishes, why shouldn&#39;t they be able to work as intended? ^_^<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>To get a setup where a large-scale wish works exactly right, you pretty much need a mind-reading intelligent wish-granter - if they can&#39;t read your mind, and act intelligently on what they see, they won&#39;t know all the things you <i>mean</i> but don&#39;t say. To look at your wish: education, health, safety, civil rights, the environment? The easiest way to keep people healthy and safe is to shut down all industry (also saves the environment!). Electricity is not required for any of your priorities. Nor is food beyond what&#39;s nutritionally required, so we&#39;re all living on soya beans - not because access to other food is <i>restricted</i> (that would be a civil rights violation), but because the government is only supporting soya (or whatever; pick your own suitable staple).<br><br>Education? Let&#39;s assume you mean &#39;the education you yourself have received&#39;, rather than &#39;anything so long as they&#39;re learning&#39;. But wait, that means everywhere is turned into America, and gets to learn about American history rather than its own. Cultural preservation isn&#39;t on the list, so that&#39;s fine, right? Unless you&#39;ve got a <i>very</i> intelligent wish-granter, they&#39;re not even going to know where to start!<br><br>And once you <i>do</i> have a super-intelligent all-powerful mind reader... why are they spending their time granting wishes for the people who have so many horrible thoughts all the time?<br><br>*Are they enslaved (either overtly or by their nature)? That&#39;s an excellent reason to sabotage the wishes.<br><br>*Or are they doing it of their own free will? In which case they&#39;re only going to grant the wishes that accord with their own desires anyway.<br><br>*Or do they Just Want To Help? In which case why are they waiting for wishes? They&#39;re already a godlike entity, they might as well just fix things.<br><br>It takes a lot of storywrangling to create a wish-giver that will both want and be able to grant the wish you mean to wish, with the consequences you mean to happen. Given how many things in our own world have unintended consequences (hey, I hear burning coal is great for heating!), why would magic wishes be any different?<br><br>hS<br><br>PS: We&#39;re the PPC. Screwball comedy is how we roll. ^_^<br><br>PPS: Self-nitpicking: if I&#39;m reclassing the Kelda as a Beserker, I may as well go all the way and switch to using Jeannie. Seems more her speed, plus Rob Anybody will be even more likely to bring the clan to her aid.<br><br>(And if these Heroic Spirits are actually copies, rather than the originals transported, then Real!Jeannie will also come along to get angry at her duplicate. And then, y&#39;know, Feegles, fightin&#39;...)</p>

            <p>Its desire is to manifest itself in the world, in the form of a wish, so I don&#39;t think it especially cares what the wish is as long as you make one? The catch is that it can only carry out your wish by means you yourself can comprehend. So, one guy&#39;s wish was to save people from suffering, but he&#39;d lived his life as an assassin, saving the many by killing the few or the one—even if the one was someone he cared about. His wish was basically reduced to a mathematical process by which the population of the world was eventually wiped out altogether. (He refused to make the wish once he saw the consequences.)<br><br>So yeah, canonically, it&#39;s a tricky business indeed. It relies on the wish-maker to really understand what they&#39;re doing, and themself, to boot.<br><br>Or, well, that&#39;s my read on it from limited information about the franchise. I&#39;m sure someone will correct me. {= )<br><br>For context, this wish is where I arrived from a starting position of &quot;Thanos has a point, but I don&#39;t want to kill people, so...&quot; Basically, what&#39;s the best way to reduce the world&#39;s population? I can&#39;t math hard enough to limit the birth rate without eventually making us go extinct, so that&#39;s out. Educating women, though—that helps. Let&#39;s make sure all women can get educated. And heck, why leave out the men? Everyone gets access to education. While we&#39;re at it... And here we are.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Badfic!Grail. Some delightful little Suvian throws out all known timelines and makes up something that has no business in the <i>Fate</i> continuum. The agents on the mission wind up with the Grail&#39;s vessel on their hands, and make the brilliant decision to bring it back to HQ. This proto-Grail looks around, goes WTF?, shrugs, and starts handing out command seals to kick off a war, because that&#39;s what it does. The rules are heavily influenced by the laws of HQ, so Rule of Funny is in full force. It&#39;s gonna be no-class-limits Battle Royale–style. Cue shenanigans and screwball comedy as we all try to get through this without dying or being overly nasty to the canon characters, who clearly can&#39;t die but definitely need to go back where they belong. ^_^<br><br>I&#39;m assuming fictionalized agent versions of ourselves as Masters so we don&#39;t have to chuck out the entire discussion so far and start over, but if you want to imagine who your agents would try to summon, why not? {= )<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>The system for the snowfield grail war is that the &quot;false&quot; holy grail war acts as a primer for the &quot;true&quot; holy grail war. The fake war is actually necessary for the ritual. So it does summon the grail, just not in the way the Fuyuki system does it. At least in theory.<br><br>Another point, I&#39;m not sure the grail war would even work in HQ, or at least, work as seen in the Nasuverse. Grail wars require certain conditions in the world to be met. For example, the timelines/worlds in which Tsukihime takes place will never have a grail war because the very nature of those timelines/worlds contains a &quot;denial of human history&quot; aspect which makes it impossible to summon heroic spirits, even if they still exist. I&#39;m not sure if the conditions and parameters of HQ would allow for the ritual to even activate. At the very least I&#39;m pretty sure we would need to create our own version of the grail or make adjustments since I&#39;m positive the Nasuverse one wouldn&#39;t activate at all, especially with how planets work in universe. Although, there might be some angle that I&#39;m not thinking of.</p>

            <p>Almost all Fate properties are in some variant alternate universe.  But also keep in mind the grails in FGO are very different.  For starters there are a ton.  Some are more corrupt than others and require cleansing others are fine as is.<br><br>For example Fuyuki was extremely corrupted, which is why there was only one non-corrupted servant (aside from Mash and any the PC brings) in that entire singularity.

            <p>Normslly, when a Ruler shows up, it&#39;s to put things in order, because somebody&#39;s been messing with the rules or something.

            <p>The only thing really strong enough to hurt a servant is another servant.

In the Fate universe a servant&#39;s strength is based on the location the grail war is taking place and the strength of their legend.  Apocrypha took place in Romania.  While the fight occurred in Romania he was arguably the strongest servant.  He got taken out of Romania and was forced to use his second noble phantasm.  Legend of Dracula.  Which turned him into the strongest Vampire in existence.  He was basically able to rag doll the servants present including Karna, Achilles, and Atalanta shrugging of all attacks.  He meets one Ruler and retreats encounters the second Ruler and is curb-stomped in about five seconds. <br><br>Likewise Assassin of Black, True Name Jack the Ripper.  None of the other Servants were fairing well against Jack especially once it went into her Reality Marble.

Jeanne D&#39;Arc&#39;s Luminosite Eternelle is basically a Universal Attack Nope, and her La Pucelle could have destroyed the Greater Grail if Amakusa (another Ruler) hadn&#39;t used his Big Crunch to stop it. This is on top of things like being able to tell the True Names of any Servant and having their Command Seals, which they can use on any Servant. So, even if you beat them, you probably won&#39;t live to tell about it.<br><br>As I understand it, though I could be wrong, it&#39;s basically when the Grail is controlled by one party entirely, and they, for the moment, at least, are not interested in fighting over it for whatever reason. In our case, the party would probably be the PPC, and while there are differences from the Yggdmillennia case, at the end of the day, if seven of us were chosen as Masters, there would, in all likelihood, be no war. Thus, the PPC would be placed against some other organization, who would have seven Masters of their own so that blood would actually be spilled.</p>

            <p>There&#39;s a phenomenon in Civ 5 called the Carpet Of Doom, in which a high-level AI builds up a frighteningly vast military and shows up with it basically covering most of the map.

            <p>I&#39;ve explained my first choice <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=320033;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">here</a>. My second choice is Suicide from <i>Gates of Fire</i> (that&#39;s the original, not the PPC agent, though that would be fun, too).<br><br>My first impulse was that he&#39;d be a Berserker, but I think there&#39;s a good case for him being a Lancer. His weapon of choice is the darning needles (basically short spears), for starters, but more than that, Lancer is a pretty well-rounded class, and he&#39;s a pretty well-rounded guy. In addition to being unstoppable in a fight, he&#39;s also a battlefield medic and a bit of a philosopher (if you can ever get him talking enough to show it). The thing that sets him apart is that he just won&#39;t freaking die, and I reckon that qualifies for a Noble Phantasm. You&#39;d basically have to throw an entire army at him to stop him once he gets going, and even then you might not kill him. Luck and possibly the gods are on his side.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>So, speaking of PPC Agents - if your (and this is a general you, although I&#39;ll admit to a fair bit of curiosity as to one particular agent of Neshomeh&#39;s) Agents were to somehow wind up as Servants, what classes do you think they&#39;d end up as? And, assuming you feel like doing the work to go over everything, what do you suppose their stats, Noble Phantasms, and Skills would be? I&#39;ll probably post my conjectures about mine later, when I <strike>get off my butt and do the work for it</strike> have the time, but I&#39;d like to see what other people think of theirs.<br><br>If you feel like checking them out, on <a href="http://typemoon.wikia.com/wiki/Servant#Factors">this</a> page, there&#39;s a table with the base stats for the core Servant classes, although you have to scroll down a bit, and on <a href="http://typemoon.wikia.com/wiki/Skill">this</a> page, you can find a very large list of skills from which you might derive inspiration. The Class Skills for the seven core classes are as follows:<br><br>Saber: Magic Resistance, Riding<br>Lancer: Magic Resistance<br>Archer: Independent Action, Magic Resistance<br>Rider: Riding, Magic Resistance<br>Assassin: Presence Concealment<br>Caster: Item Construction, Territory Creation<br>Berserker: Madness Enhancement</p>

            <p>Naturally, I remember almost none of what we came up with, but let&#39;s start with the easy ones:<br><br>Jenni: Obvious Caster is obvious. Obvious Reality Marble is also obvious. Not that it will help you get out once you&#39;re in it...<br><br>Gall: Rider, with her dragon as her Noble Phantasm.<br><br>Derik: Three possibilities:<br>- Original Recipe: Rider, with Noble Phantasm like above.<br>- Extra Crispy: Berserker, what with trading sanity for smashing things with a hammer being his current MO. His Noble Phantasm means he sometimes comes over all Opera-Ghosty and might strangle things with a guitar string from the shadows instead.<br>- Honey Glazed: Saber. Smashing things with a hammer while perfectly sane and possibly reading your emotions to get the upper hand. Noble Phantasm... I dunno, this character arc is only just starting. ^_^; There is an idea I&#39;m toying with: You know that &quot;trading an eye for wisdom&quot; thing? That is totally what happened to him in the Reality Room. It wasn&#39;t deliberate, but it&#39;s funny as heck now that I&#39;m aware of it. So like, to extend that theme, maybe some sort of trade-off of present perception for greater awareness? I&#39;unno. <br><br>Nume: Assassin. He will sneak up on you and jab you with a syringe full of liquid salt, and you&#39;ll never see it coming. He&#39;s just a geek in a pinstripe shirt. His Noble Phantasm is encyclopedic knowledge of anything he gets a chance to study. Yes, he&#39;s been studying you. No, you don&#39;t get any last words. Shh, shh. Only dreams now.<br><br>Ilraen: We debated this one a bit, but I think he&#39;s a Saber. It suits his personality, and the blade comes attached! I haven&#39;t figured out a Noble Phantasm yet.<br><br>I don&#39;t have time to get into skills and all the rest, but if you want to, have at it!<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>The ultimate pacifist summon: <i>Farscape</i>&#39;s Pilot (and living ship Moya), Rider class. Noble Phantasm: Starburst. Strategy: Run away. Really, really fast. Maybe in a way that leads our opponents into a cunning trap, if we&#39;re lucky. ^_^<br><br>If I had to pick one of the crew... &#39;Course D&#39;Argo would make a great Berserker or Saber, depending on which season we&#39;re in; and you could pick Zhaan as a Caster or Chiana or Rygel as an Assassin; Aeryn would have to be a Rider (flies ships good) or an Archer (shoots guns good), I think... but I gotta go with Crichton. He&#39;d be a Rider, because he flies a one-man spacecraft of his own invention, sometimes through wormholes. His Noble Phantasm is a galaxy-devouring wormhole weapon. You don&#39;t wanna be standing too close to that when it goes off.<br><br>A really strong choice might be Scorpius as a Caster, on the principle that sufficiently advanced science is indistinguishable from magic. Noble Phantasm: Aurora Chair—we now know everything about you and your plans, thanks! But since he would absolutely betray me if he thought it would further his own goals, that&#39;s a BAD choice.<br><br>Could also go with Crais as Berserker or Rider, depending. The latter would be pretty awesome, but too spoilery to go into in detail.<br><br>Holy Grail War in Space!<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Now, there are a couple of fantastic options here. Of course, I <i>could</i> summon Iskandar in the rider class. Because Fate is a work of fiction, and while he&#39;s <i>based</i> on a real character, he&#39;s definitely fictional.<br><br>Magnus The Red could be summoned as either a Caster or a Beserker—although I&#39;d hew Caster, myself. So there&#39;s that.<br><br>Ahzek Ahriman could be summoned as a Caster, or an Avenger. Again, Caster is probably the better of the two, at least for me.<br><br>Another Caster I could summon is Masterharper Robinton. Because why not? Actually, the answer is that he&#39;s not on the level of the other spirits he&#39;d be facing. So it may not be the best idea... But you&#39;d get to see <i>Robinton</i>!<br><br>So there are a lot of them... but I&#39;d probably go for Ahriman or Iskandar at the end of the day. Ahriman has a shockingly wholesome reason to want the grail, and while both of them could be damaging to the world at large, I trust both of them more than Magnus, who might try to start some kind of psychic eugenics program.</p>

            <p>He&#39;d be a Caster the same way that Shakespeare is a Caster in <i>Apocrypha</i>, and while at first glance it might seem like there&#39;s a massive power discrepancy between him and many of the other characters mentioned so far, lemme explain why I think it doesn&#39;t matter.<br><br>The Caster class isn&#39;t about martial power, it&#39;s about magic and manipulation. Caster!Robinton is going to use magically-amped song, story, and sheer charisma to persuade you to his point of view. We don&#39;t have to fight, you know. Surely there&#39;s a better way to settle things. And, if we get the Grail, things will be better for everyone. Come, have a glass of wine with me and listen to what I propose...<br><br>And, if that doesn&#39;t work, there&#39;s always his Noble Phantasm, which I&#39;m gonna call Friends in High Places. One thing that marks Robinton out as a unique person is that even the dragons of Pern recognize him and honor him. Dragons spoke to him to keep him from slipping away after his heart attack—and that&#39;s not a thing they just do, ever. If he gets into trouble, guess who&#39;s coming to help? ^_^<br><br>I reckon he&#39;d be on board with my wish, too, which I&#39;ve put a lot of thought into. As I understand it, the Grail can only carry out your wish by means you yourself are capable of imagining, so with the help of the Masterharper, I&#39;m gonna come up with an air-tight way to ask for all the governments of the world to be bound to prioritize education for all, health &amp; safety &amp; civil rights (these things are intrinsically linked), and the environment henceforth. That way, we MIGHT be able to pull ourselves out of the mess we&#39;ve made of things without any overly drastic upheaval.<br><br>~Neshomeh should remember not to drink caffeine at night.</p>

            <p>I actually did think of that. The thing is, Robinton is definitely willing to die for his beliefs. But is he willing to kill for them?

            <p>So here&#39;s the plan: Win over what allies we can, hopefully as many as three—the Grail seems to manifest with that many Servants remaining. Let the rest fight it out like they&#39;re so determined to do. It&#39;s almost guaranteed that most of the people who choose to get involved in the war are ruthless and fixed on their own goals, so that&#39;s likely to be the majority.

            <p>Several more if I&#39;m allowed to summon my own characters, but that seems a little bit... weighted, somehow.<br><br>The first idea is Izaya Orihara from <i>Durarara!!</i>, as an Assassin. It&#39;s only fitting for an information broker and known-manipulator-of-an-entire-district-of-Tokyo, after all.<br><br>The second idea is something some people will probably consider cheating: Briar Moss (AKA Roach) from Tamora Pierce&#39;s <i>Circle of Magic</i> series, dual-classed as Caster/Assassin with emphasis on his Caster side.

            <p>We are currently arguing over a number of things - for one, certain characters, like Sherlock Holmes, James Moriarty, and Edward Dantes are off-limits due to having already appeared in certain properties - Grand Order comes to mind. Therefore, is it possible to summon alternate versions of them? And is it possible to summon other characters from the same story?<br><br>For the first, I&#39;d argue not. A character who is essentially Sherlock Holmes is, well, Sherlock Holmes at core, regardless of what&#39;s being used as a variation. They are absolutely linked to the character of Sherlock Holmes, and thus cannot be summoned - regardless of any Class issues that may emerge. <br><br>for the second... I&#39;d be generally against it, given that both Moriarty and Holmes can be summoned, but I would personally be more flexible on individual cases.</p>

            <p>What about Gods? After all, in Fate, Divine Spirits are a thing. However, if a spirit is Divine, then it&#39;s generally too powerful to be made a Servant. E.G., you won&#39;t get Zeus showing up, and Artemis only sneaks her way in because she basically makes herself into Orion, stats-wise. On the other hand, there are a few entities - for example, Stheno and Euryale - who are divine, but are also so weak that being made into Servants is a distinct upgrade for them. Thus, what is to be done with gods?<br><br>I&#39;d argue that the higher-tiers are out. You&#39;re not getting around this one by summoning, say, Hades from Disney or Percy Jackson and then just releasing the Underworld on your opponents, and for that matter, those who are able to go up against gods, at least lesser ones, might be out too. For example, the Dresden Files&#39; Queens Titania and Mab, as of Changes which is where I&#39;m at, are probably out. <br><br>On the other hand, if you&#39;ve got a really, really weak god - for example, isn&#39;t there a god in Discworld who is left near-powerless due to having only one person who truly believes in him? - you might get away with sliding them into one of the classes, but it might be best if you didn&#39;t, as they&#39;re probably going to be pretty weak.</p>

            <p>Um... alright. Let&#39;s see... actually, I have a question - does a character&#39;s repute in our world make a difference in their power?

            <p><strike>I summon Jeanne Alter to wreak death upon my enemies! </strike> Hush, Grand Order me. My general inclination is to go for Caster or Assassin. Caster because magic is awesome, and Assassin because then I can steal the Holy Grail and hide it or make a wish before anybody else can, and then nobody has to die! My villainy is unmatched in this world!<br><br>But, anyways. Assuming I&#39;m fighting... I&#39;ve got a few ideas. One that&#39;s been recommended to me due to probably having a similar wish would be Asriel, of Undertale. To be clear - <i>not</i> Flowey. Asriel. He&#39;d be, in all likelihood, a Caster-class Servant, and assuming his Noble Phantasm didn&#39;t disqualify him, it would probably be to assume his God of Hyperdeath form. Not only is that going to be rather difficult to defeat, he&#39;ll get stronger each time he defeats someone. Considering how much a human soul does for a monster, you have to wonder what a Heroic Spirit&#39;s does. And then, at the end, everything gets fixed because bleep you war. ... This is assuming he could ever be persuaded to actually participate, which is unlikely and which I honestly wouldn&#39;t mind if the other Masters and Servants would leave me out of it.<br><br>But, let&#39;s see... beyond that... most classics are out. I don&#39;t know many, and I&#39;m pretty sure a magic lance would reach out from my phone and stab me if I tried to say Dracula. But... hm. Trisanna Chandler, Caster-Class, from the Circle of Magic. Hope you enjoy getting lava in your face!<br><br>I suppose I could take the Mary-Anne route to justify summoning, say, Maka and Soul, Lancer-Class Servants, or Death the Kid with Liz and Patty, Archer-Class Servants. Or I could basically ask for my own death and summon the Berserker Asura. Which... I wouldn&#39;t do, because I don&#39;t particularly feel like passively being involved in the destruction of cities. Of them, I think I&#39;d probably opt for Maka and Soul.<br><br>There&#39;s also Harry Dresden, Caster-Class Servant, but... let&#39;s just say a book I just read slightly sours me on that idea. But he might work.<br><br>As I&#39;ve assembled far too many and need to go back through everything I&#39;ve ever read or watched, I suppose I&#39;ll let it go for now. It feels like the perfect Servant is sitting just out of thought&#39;s reach, though.</p>

To A Unified Theory</a><br><br>---<br><br><i>&quot;Fairest and fallen,&quot; Siobhan said, her voice thick with the effort of not stammering, not giving in, not letting everything win, &quot;greetings and defiance.&quot;</i><br><br>The Lone Power arched an exquisite eyebrow for a second, then gave a theatrical, tinkling sigh. &quot;They always say that. Every time. You know, just once, I&#39;d like for a wizard to be <i>original</i>. Is that so much to ask? But no, it&#39;s always &#39;Fairest and fallen&#39; this and &#39;greetings and defiance&#39; that. Change the record now and again, it might do you good.&quot;<br><br>&quot;You. Um.&quot; Siobhan paused and looked at Wombat, who shrugged. &quot;Er. You won&#39;t get away with this!&quot;<br><br>&quot;That too, little wizard, that too. Normally about fifteen minutes after I already <i>have</i>, because mortal brains do tend to arrive to coherent thought fashionably late. Then again, when you&#39;re me, linear time is something that happens to other people.&quot;<br><br>Running out of brainpower, Siobhan tried a different tack. &quot;Oingo boingo, my old man&#39;s a mushroom, happy happy boom boom swamp swamp swamp.&quot;<br><br>&quot;... I&#39;ve heard-&quot;<br><br>&quot;You&#39;ve heard that too.&quot; Siobhan sighed. &quot;Of course you have.&quot;<br><br>&quot;After this exact amount of tries. Humans always think they&#39;re so <i>clever</i>, but I really have seen it all before. Or at least, I will.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yeah, non-linear experience of time, you mentioned.&quot;<br><br>&quot;So, with that all settled...&quot; The Lone Power sashayed forward, grace personified. It snapped a finger and a chaise longue appeared from nowhere, and It artfully lounged upon the crushed red velvet. &quot;I presume you&#39;ve come to try and stop me.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I. Er. Well, yes. It&#39;s sort of the job description. I thought that was covered in the, er, &#39;defiance&#39; part of the traditional greeting.&quot;<br><br>&quot;You&#39;re trying to be clever too!&quot; It clapped Its hands, like a proud dog owner whose puppy has finally learned not to leave steaming dumps on the upholstery. &quot;It&#39;s quite cute, really. Good look on a boy with your bone structure.&quot;<br><br>Siobhan flinched.<br><br>&quot;Oh dear,&quot; It continued, &quot;does that strike a nerve? I&#39;m quite knowledgeable about illusions, young man. The images mortal wizards put about to pretend that things that aren&#39;t real <i>are</i>. Why pretend any more? No-one&#39;s buying it. Why would anyone <i>want</i> to?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I...&quot; Siobhan squeaked, then stopped, breath hitching in her throat. Her arm twitched, knocking over her drink. Wombat scooched out of the way of the blue flood. &quot;Frig. Stupid arm.&quot;<br><br>She looked down, then felt something touch her through the thick sleeve of her raincoat. She turned her head and saw Wombat nuzzling her, gently, slowly, firmly. Then she looked back up.<br><br>&quot;I <i>will</i> stop you, Lone One.&quot;<br><br>&quot;You don&#39;t even know what it is you&#39;re trying to stop.&quot; It laughed, high and clear. Siobhan felt like the whole world was laughing alongside It. &quot;You&#39;re groping in the dark for answers, but you know absolutely nothing. Then again, why break the habit of a lifetime?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Because you&#39;re trying to play on my insecurities about my intelligence and my self-worth and my gender identity. That&#39;s been your plan to deal with me from the word go. And it&#39;s not working. Not any more.&quot;<br><br>The Lone Power looked as if she&#39;d just been doused with cold water. It sat up and glared at Siobhan, who stared right back, eyes half-hidden by the hood of her raincoat.<br><br>&quot;So then.&quot; Siobhan began to walk back and forth. &quot;Let&#39;s have a little think about this, shall we? Why do you want me to leave? Whatever you&#39;re doing involves everyone being out of the pub unless they&#39;re under your direct control. Every other wizard, lowest to highest, has wandered off to... wherever. Actually, you know what?&quot; She snapped her fingers, spinning on the spot briefly. &quot;I don&#39;t think we even moved. You gave it away yourself, rabbiting on at me about illusions. Pretending things are real. And since none of them have come back in... I think you needed all the wizards on the other side of a locked door.&quot;<br><br>&quot;What a lovely story,&quot; sighed the Lone Power with the tone of a mother looking at a small child&#39;s potato print painting and reassuring the kid that yes, darling, it&#39;s definitely going on the fridge. &quot;Do you intend to get to the point? Or do you just like the sound of your own voice.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Getting there, getting there, patience is a virtue even for beings who don&#39;t abide by the rules of causality and linear time.&quot; Siobhan had wandered halfway around the table by this point, but now she turned and began to walk back. &quot;So. Next question: why aren&#39;t we all dead? I&#39;m new to all this magic lark, but I&#39;ve got the general impression that you&#39;re not a fan of wizards. So why not kill us? Why go through the rigmarole of making an illusion that&#39;s individually tailored to each wizard on the premises? That&#39;s a lot of work... so whatever you&#39;ve got planned means that you <i>need</i> them alive.<br><br>&quot;So, you need everybody alive and you need everybody out, but the illusion... I&#39;m gonna hazard a guess that it fades away after a certain point? Bet the wizards outside are trying to get in right this second, aren&#39;t they? But the doors are locked until everyone&#39;s out, and then you can get on with whatever it was you were doing. If I were a betting woman, and I&#39;m not-&quot;<br><br>&quot;No,&quot; It said. &quot;You&#39;re not.<br><br>&quot;-Yes, thank you for your input, I told you it&#39;s <i>not working</i>.&quot; Siobhan&#39;s arm twitched again, her knuckles clunking off Purple&#39;s pint pot of mixed nuts. &quot;Ow. Smeg. Anyway. I reckon you&#39;re putting a curse on the building. There&#39;s people from all over the shop in this pub. It&#39;s just like Purple said, all the world passes through, like a regular crosstime saloon. Heh. I wonder if there&#39;s ever been a Callahan in here. So anyway, I&#39;d say, if I had to make an educated guess, that you&#39;re making yourself a part of the building. And after that, every wizard who passes through takes a little bit of you with them when they leave. Your malice. Your cruelty. Your spite. Your inherent <i>youness</i>. And that makes you spread. All across time and space, scattered throughout Earth&#39;s history and among its interplanetary neighbours. You&#39;re going viral. That&#39;s your play, and that&#39;s why you needed everyone out, because every single wizard would know what you were doing and stop you. You just did the magical equivalent of leaning back and elbowing a fire alarm. And it almost, <i>almost</i> worked. But here I am. Trying to stop you.&quot;<br><br>The Lone Power clapped three times, each more derisory than the last. &quot;Pretty little speech. Is that really what you think I&#39;m up to?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yeah, I&#39;d say so. If it wasn&#39;t, you&#39;d be a lot more smug. But hey, you caused the collapse of Roman Britain and you drowned a school full of children under a sea of coal slag, maybe you&#39;re good at compartmentalizing. Either way up, that&#39;s your plan. And now you&#39;re not going to kill me, because that&#39;s <i>my</i> plan.&quot;<br><br>&quot;What.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Well, look at it rationally. You kill me, two options. Either you hide the body or you don&#39;t. Whichever one you pick, Purple&#39;s got to come back into the pub for your plan to work, and he knows I&#39;m here. So that&#39;ll set off the alarm bells. And it&#39;ll get stopped. Maybe not by me, but someone will stop you. Someone <i>will</i> stand in your way. Because someone has to.&quot;<br><br>&quot;What masterful reasoning.&quot;<br><br>Siobhan started pacing faster at that. The Lone One was smiling, and that was <i>bad</i> in a way she couldn&#39;t express without resorting to her lizard hindbrain.<br><br>&quot;Yeah, um-&quot;<br><br>&quot;Of course,&quot; said the Lone Power in a voice like a silk scabbard, &quot;I could just kill you, craft a reasonably convincing illusion, and have your little friend talk to that to see that you&#39;re well and not to worry about anything.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Ah.&quot; Siobhan paced faster still.<br><br>&quot;Which means I win, I think. And you die, of course, but you&#39;re a mortal, you people are used to that sort of thing.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Well, I mean, it only happens to us once-&quot;<br><br>&quot;<i>Is that a challenge, you stupid little boy</i>?&quot;<br><br>Siobhan&#39;s eyes were like soup plates and the corners of them were filling with tears. &quot;Can I say my goodbyes, then?&quot;<br><br>It waved a hand in a loftily dismissive fashion. &quot;Oh, go on, then. It can&#39;t hurt.&quot;<br><br>Siobhan turned to Wombat. The glittering in his one glass eye was dull and faded as old newsprint. &quot;I&#39;m so sorry, Wombat. I failed you. I should have seen the signs.&quot;<br><br>Wombat placed a paw on her hand, smoothing over the bruise on her knuckles. &quot;It&#39;s going to be all right, Siobhan.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I hope so,&quot; said Siobhan, and only the stuffed animal could see her wink at him. &quot;Because there&#39;s a thing about signs. It&#39;s called indexicality. One of the three keystones of modern linguistic theory, and therefore anthropology, as it relates to signs and their referents. Simply put, indexicality refers to the phenomenon of a sign pointing to object X in a specific context in which it occurs. The signs above pubs are a great example, actually, as they are indices of not only the social construct of &#39;the pub&#39; but also of the specific pub itself - what kind of pub it is, what kind of beer it serves, the brewery it&#39;s tied to, if any, the list goes on. Now it seems to me that you need this specific pub, with these specific indices, and one of the things I noticed about this pub was that it&#39;s a proper old spit-and-sawdust gaff. Do you know what that means? It means I can trace out a spell diagram with my foot and rabbit on about it until I can cast the claudication and grab my one absolute emergency backup plan-&quot;<br><br>Siobhan reached out her hand as the spell caught, and within it appeared from nowhere the handle of a small orange suitcase. It was glowing.<br><br>&quot;-and you need this one specific pub to do your dirty work, and I am not going to let that happen because I am Siobhan Jones, a wizard of Earth, and I&#39;m going to do what I do best!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Go on a day trip?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Nope! Hide behind a table and wait for the noise to stop!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Whuh?&quot;<br><br>Siobhan unzipped the bag, grabbed Wombat, and dived behind an upturned table.<br><br>The world went very briefly orange, and then brightest white.<br><br>---<br><br>Purple looked on as the Group Dynamic exploded in a gigantic ball of light, the top half of the front almost totally torn away. Whatever illusion there was disintegrated on contact with the light, and as soon as it did the parade of wizards poured into the pub. All the snakes were dead. The place stank of burnt beer and charred wood.<br><br>And up against what was left of the front wall, behind a table, her left arm crushed even as the right cradled a keening Wombat, Eats-The-Purple-Fruits found his friend.<br><br>&quot;... Chick?&quot;<br><br>Nothing.<br><br>&quot;<i>Chick</i>?&quot;<br><br>Still nothing.<br><br>And then,<br><br>blurry,<br><br>slowly,<br><br>waking,<br><br>as if from a very strange dream,<br><br>&quot;mrrrstfgl?&quot;<br><br>&quot;SIOBHAN!&quot;<br><br>&quot;wha?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Siobhan, you&#39;re okay!&quot; Purple dive-bombed the girl and sat on her shoulder, nibbling her bloodied ear with joy. &quot;Well, you know, given values of okay that might include severe tissue damage, but you&#39;re not dead! Which is always a plus.&quot;<br><br>&quot;oh. mkay. izzit gone?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Is what gone - oh <i>skree</i>, the Lone Power did this?&quot;<br><br>&quot;nuh. me. aaaaaaaall parta th&#39;plan. ow. tryna... take over th&#39;pub.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Overshadow the pub?&quot;<br><br>&quot;yup. needed somethin for that tho.&quot;<br><br>&quot;What?&quot;<br><br>Siobhan grinned, slightly maniacally. &quot;y&#39;need a pub.&quot;<br><br>He couldn&#39;t help it. Purple just burst out laughing. It was probably the stress.<br><br>&quot;wha happ&#39;ning now, purple?&quot;<br><br>&quot;What? Um. No idea. We should probably talk to the local Area Senior. I mean, assuming they&#39;re even on the planet, there&#39;s been something happening involving Jupiter and it&#39;s all a big mess and you&#39;re covered in splinters and burns and you made a wisecrack.&quot;<br><br>&quot;iss the british way. i go sleep now.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Oh, <i>skree</i>, uh, no, Siobhan, you stay with me now. You stay right here, okay? You focus on my voice.&quot;<br><br>&quot;sa nice voice.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yeah? First time for everything. C&#39;mon, chick, stay with me...&quot;<br><br>---<br><br>A week later, the press reported that a gas explosion had ripped through Princes Arcade, demolishing one thankfully-empty pub. It was a miracle nobody was hurt, apparently.<br><br>Siobhan saw it on the hospital telly, but she paid it no mind. Instead, she read through more of her Manual. There was a card from a schoolfriend, one from her Nana in Birmingham, and none from her more immediate family. They hadn&#39;t even been to visit. She was okay with that.<br><br>The little green parakeet sat on the windowsill, chirruping happily away. Every patient sort of understood it, in some way; the bird was trying to help them get better, in its own small way. They weren&#39;t sure quite how they knew, but they knew.<br><br>After lights-out that night, the bird hopped over to Siobhan as she lay in her bed, a discreet light spell cast on the pages of her book as she read. &quot;You&#39;re going to be okay,&quot; Purple said.<br><br>&quot;I believe you,&quot; said Siobhan Jones, a wizard of Earth.<br><br>So she closed her book, leaned back, closed her eyes, and believed.<br><br>---<br><br>This was the final chapter of <b>General Theories</b>, my ordealfic from earlier this year.

            <p>Was the little orange suitcase from Chapter 2 with the T-shirt inside it. Y&#39;know, the shirt with the slightly bungled light spell on it? That one. Siobhan&#39;s spell was a claudication to reach through to her bedroom and grab it, which she was able to do by drawing a spell diagram in the sawdust on the floor (a common feature of old pubs in the UK) and rambling about stuff - which is how she actually <i>casts</i> spells. =]</p>

The second thing you will notice is the presence in the exterior lobes of lines entirely separated from the continuous thread of the Speech.<br><br>These features, which you will likely not have encountered before, are known as the Unbroken Circle, and they stand in for the Name of the One. Always placed separately from the standard spell structure, they are here used to invoke and request the specific power the One retains for themself: that of animating the inanimate.<br><br>This is rare. Not more than one wizard in a thousand will ever invoke the One directly in their lifetime. The spell takes the form less of an instruction set for the universe, and more of a direct appeal to the One above all Powers: &#39;I need this; here&#39;s why; please let me do it&#39;.<br><br>This spell has a few other interesting features. While the caster&#39;s Name is presented in the usual format (to south), she has also included a &#39;pseudo-name&#39;-formatted sub-circle for the entity being animated (to west). This adopts the triangular form of a name, but without any of the internal structure.<br><br>Finally, to east, we see the signature-form of Eats-the-Purple-Fruits&#39; Name. This cut-down identifier is used when the named wizard is not a true participant in the spell - and indeed, he is here identified as a guide and supervisor, not as a caster himself.<br><br>((... and yeah, I couldn&#39;t resist.))<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Thanks to Snowy the Sane Fangirl for beta-reading.<br><br>Here are my agent bios:<br>Name: Edward Stone (formerly known as Edward Eagle, but he changed it because he was being teased about another Eddie the Eagle.)<br><br>Species: Peculiar male<br><br>Home continuum: Miss Peregrine’s Home for Peculiar Children<br><br>Age: Twenty<br><br>Appearance: A little taller than average, with dark hair and brown eyes. Usually likes to wear grey or black clothes.<br><br>Powers: As a peculiar, his peculiarity is that he can control water. However, he rarely does, because there isn’t much water in HQ and it doesn’t work in disguise. He usually uses either a rifle or his muggle-use wand as a weapon.<br><br>Personality: Edward is very cynical and pessimistic, and unwilling to tolerate other people’s failings. He’s convinced the Ironic Overpower is out to get him, although it’s unclear whether he’s serious about this. He enjoys winding his sister up, making snarky comments and reading.  He can also be very pedantic and picks up on grammar mistakes a lot.<br><br>History: Edward was recruited from a Miss Peregrine’s Home for Peculiar Children badfic, in which his sole purpose was to turn evil when the Sue ditched him for her LO. He’s been horrified about it ever since and is determined to save as many characters as he can from a similar fate – although he’d prefer to get a bit more time off from it! He’s been working for the PPC for a couple of years, and was recently transferred from Implausible Crossovers to the DMS.<br><br>Lust Object: Claims to have none, but can be seen looking in a certain way at Bellatrix Lestrange.<br><br>Department: Department of Mary Sues, Harry Potter Division.<br><br><br>Name: Katarina Eagle, known to everyone as Kat.<br><br>Species: ymbryne (pronounced imm-brinn; a woman who can turn into a bird and manipulate time and is charged with the protection of peculiar children)<br><br>Home continuum: Miss Peregrine’s Home for Peculiar Children<br><br>Age: Twenty<br><br>Appearance: relatively short, with uncontrollable blonde hair which she tries and fails to keep in a neat bun, and blueish-green eyes. Prefers to wear practical clothes, but will dress up for special occasions.<br><br>Powers: As mentioned, she’s an ymbryne. She can create time loops, which only peculiars can enter; turn into a bird (an eagle, in her case) and manipulate people’s minds. Once again, this doesn’t work in disguise. Discovering that was rather a nasty shock for Kat, who was used to being able to rely on her powers. She’s been training ever since she was recruited into the PPC, but she’s still not great with weapons and prefers to leave the fighting to Edward. She carries a Muggle-use wand and a small dagger.<br><br>Personality: Kat can come across as quite hyper, as she has a short attention span and is easily bored. That’s not to say that she can’t act maturely when she wants to, though. She’s the more sentimental one of the two and has a soft spot for CAFs, which she prefers to save if possible. She’s secretly a bit of a fangirl, although she tries to hide it as much as possible.  <br><br>History: Kat was recruited from the same badfic as her twin brother, in which she was the Sue’s best friend. She’s been working in the DMS since she joined the PPC, and hasn’t really seen Edward much since. Instead she’s been working with a more experienced agent, who has now moved on to teach another newbie.<br><br>Lust Object: Remus Lupin<br><br>Department: DMS, Harry Potter Division<br><br><br>Control prompt: the agents receive a mission.<br>Edward had just reached for a pack of cards when the console went [BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEP!]. <br><br>“Typical,” he muttered, reaching the console before Kat had even managed to get up from the sofa where she was listening to music on her iPod. <br><br>He hit the console to stop the beeping, and then cringed as he saw the summary.<br><br>“You’ll like this, Kat!” he called<br><br>She removed her headphones and said “Do I detect a hint of sarcasm there?”<br><br>Edward nodded and began to read. “Princess of the unicorns – Remus Lupin Love Story”.<br><br>Kat’s neutral expression quickly turned to one of horror. “I’ve only heard the title, and I already hate this Sue. That must be a record.”<br><br>Edward continued with the actual summary, voice practically dripping with sarcasm.<br><br>“Hi! My name is Uma White! I love to sing, and dance! Also I am the last of the white family, because my mum and dad where killed by Voldy moldy, yeah, I hate him too, anyway, the only reason I’m an orphan, is because I have a power, a rare power! I have unicorn blood running threw my veins! Yep,…” At that stage the console ran out of space to display the full summary. <br><br>“Oh, no. This is truly awful,” Kat said. “I’m lost for words. Which is strange, as I’m speaking right now.”<br><br>“Well, they do call it badfic for a reason,” Edward replied, trying and failing to crack a smile. “So, that’s an overuse of exclamation marks, a run-on sentence and two confusions of homophones… and we’re only in the summary. Pack the Bleeprin: this is going to be a really awful mission.”<br><br>Kat nodded and stood up.  As she did so, she said “And… Voldy Moldy? The only character who ever said that was Peeves, and… well, he’s Peeves. He shouldn’t be taken as a model of behaviour.” She grabbed about ten six-packs of Bleeprin and shoved them into her pink backpack. <br><br>Edward picked up the CAD, and said “Bet you this explodes within the first two chapters.”<br><br>“What shall we bet? Winner gets to kill the Sue?”<br><br>“You’re on,” said Edward, and the twins shook hands.<br><br><br>Random prompt: the agents encounter the Sunflower&#39;s Witness.<br>There was a knock on the RC door. Kat got up to open it, and Edward glanced up from his copy of Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them to see who it was. <br><br>In the doorway, attempting to push past Kat and gain access to RC 841.720, was a short human woman with spiky red hair, carrying an armful of pamphlets.<br><br>“Hello,” she said, “I am one of the Sunflower’s Witnesses. I was wondering if you’ve heard that the Sunflower Official was burnt with a flamethrower by the other Flowers?”<br><br>Edward blinked. “Err… what?”<br><br>Kat shook her head, shooting a slightly panicked glance over her shoulder at Edward.  “No, I haven’t heard that. How about you come in and tell me about it?”<br><br>She allowed the woman to enter the RC and they sat down at the small wooden table in the centre.<br><br>The Sunflower’s Witness handed Kat one of the pamphlets and stood up to give Edward another.<br><br>He took it and studied it carefully. In hand-drawn stick-figures, it depicted some Flowers and a flamethrower.<br><br>“Burning the SO with a flamethrower? Sounds like a good idea. Hey, Kat, do you know where I can get a flamethrower?”<br><br>Kat shook her head. “I hope you’re joking!” she said, her eyes darting about frantically as if looking for some way out.<br><br>The Sunflower’s Witness glared at Edward. “Do I detect disbelief? How dare you! Repent at once, or the spirit of the true SO will smite thee!”<br><br>Kat smiled sweetly, her eyes finally focussing directly on the Sunflower’s Witness. “I’m sure he doesn’t mean to offend anyone, he just needs time to process what you’re saying.” <br><br>Edward was furious. He was sure Kat didn’t really believe this crackpot conspiracy theory, but being treated like a toddler was infuriating. <br><br>“I’m thirsty,” continued Kat. “Would you like a drink… I don’t know your name?”<br><br>“Agent Shrike. No, thank you, I don’t need a drink.”<br><br>Nodding, Kat said “Okay. Edward, could you go and get me a glass of… water?” She winked as she said that, and Edward got her meaning at once.<br><br>He walked over to the right-hand side of the room, where his bed was, grabbed the water bottle he kept for emergencies. He also picked up his Muggle-use wand from beside the bed.<br><br>Then he walked quickly back, tucking the wand into his pocket, and handed the bottle to Kat. <br><br>She unscrewed the lid, and said “Are you sure you don’t want a sip, Agent Shrike?”<br><br>“If you insist…” the agent in question replied, taking the bottle.<br><br>Edward concentrated on the water for a moment, and it shot up directly into Agent Shrike’s eyes. <br><br>She blinked, confused, and tried to get the water out of her eyes. <br><br>Meanwhile, Edward pulled out his Muggle-use wand and said calmly “Stupefy!” A jet of red light appeared from the end of his wand, but Agent Shrike managed to lean to the side just in time. <br><br>Standing up quickly, the Sunflower’s Witness darted to the door, opened it a little, and slipped through it. “Repent!” she called, and then slammed the door behind her.<br><br>Edward gave a big sigh of relief once he was sure that the weird woman was gone. <br><br>“Good,” said Kat, “my plan worked.”<br><br>“Your plan? I was the one who executed it!” said Edward indignantly.<br><br>Kat sighed. “I can’t be bothered to argue. Let’s just agree to differ.”<br><br><br>My first mission will be to &quot;Princess of the Unicorns&quot; (<a href="https://www.quotev.com/story/10839811/Princess-of-the-unicorns-Remus-Lupin-Love-Story"><a href="https://www.quotev.com/story/10839811/Princess-of-the-unicorns-Remus-Lupin-Love-Story">https://www.quotev.com/story/10839811/Princess-of-the-unicorns-Remus-Lupin-Love-Story</a></a>). You&#39;ve already seen what my agents think of the summary, and if I need say any more: Voldemort kidnaps her. So he can marry her. To use her speshul unicorn powers.<br><br>...can you pass the Bleeprin?<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></p>

            <p>Not much to add to that, really. I know who you are, I&#39;ve seen you write these characters in prompts and stuff, everything here is in good shape SPaG- and character- and PPC-wise, and that fic certainly sounds like it needs killing!<br><br>Single point of critique: In the second piece, I wouldn&#39;t have Kat actually invite the Sunflower&#39;s Witness in. I see that the SW is being pushy and you probably intended for Kat to just give in, but she &quot;allows[s] the woman to enter&quot; and they all settle down nicely around the table like they&#39;re going to hear her out. After that, the twins&#39; prank on her seems mean-spirited. A couple easy ways you could fix it:<br><br>1. Kat says nothing, or maybe says something to put the SW off, but reluctantly gives way to the pushing.<br><br>2. If you want to keep the line of speech, have her say it after the SW barges past her, ironically.<br><br>Either way, no polite sit-down. If they don&#39;t want her there, they should act like it.<br><br>I spent a lot of text on that, but it&#39;s really only a couple of lines out of place in a piece that works just fine overall. Fix that, and the rest is good to go!<br><br>As are you. Sally forth, knight of Plort, and spork with a glad heart!<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Just the couple of lines where the SW gets in, and then remove any mentions of people getting up from the table, of which there are only two. It&#39;s a small price to pay for making your agents actually look just confused rather than like Kat is luring the SW into a trap from the get-go.<br><br>Fear not the rewrite, in any case.

            <p>First of all, massive thanks to Quincy for suggesting this. Second of all, this will be slightly different to my usual style of prompts, so we&#39;ll see how it goes. Instead of the usual prompt that will make most people think of a small story to write about, these prompts are aimed at shorter responses. So, here goes:<br><br>Prompt 1: Describe Death as a character.<br><br>Prompt 2: Describe an alien/ancient monument<br><br>Prompt 3: Describe an umbrella that is more than it seems. <br><br>Prompt 4: Describe something that should never have been. <br><br>Have fun!<br><br>Nova</p>

            <p>The figure before you looks all the more monstrous for how closely it resembles a human; the basic shape is there, but the proportions are all wrong, and the feral glee at seeing you belongs on the face of a starved predator seeing maimed prey.<br><br>“Always you bring such interesting things…”<br><br>You offer up the carefully wrapped package, and it picks apart the bindings with rapid motions.<br> <br>“Hm, black fabric, polished workings, ivory handle.”<br><br>The figure works the mechanism, either sceptical or ignorant of the bad luck said to be brought on by unfolding an umbrella indoors.<br><br> “Classic gentleman’s accessory. Yet lonely I would be if that were all the tale to tell.”<br><br>The gaunt figure closes the umbrella and begins a more detailed examination: peering closely, stroking the artefact with too-long fingers, sniffing at it – vertical slits of nostrils flaring excitedly. <br><br>“Not ivory – bone.” It licks the handle. “Human bone.”<br><br>It turns the artefact this way and that in its hands, then stares intently at you – seemingly trying to map the shape of the hooked handle on to your anatomy.<br><br>“Shape unnatural. But no sign of breakage or tooling. Suggests… contortions, mutations – a craftsman skilled in… <i>exotic</i> materials.<br><br>“Ribs… not steel – silver.” It brings the umbrella up to the side of its head, forcing one of the ribs to bend out – the figure doesn’t appear to have any ears, but nonetheless seems to be listening intently. “Attuned.”<br><br>There is a deep, soft thud, and a roll of tools appears on the countertop. The figure pulls out a series of tuning forks and taps them in turn against the sliver struts, but none make any sound. The creature’s motions get more and more frantic as it tries smaller and smaller forks, before a wide grin splits its face.<br><br>“Beyond the Seventh Gate – farther than I have travelled.”<br><br>You still haven’t heard any sound from the forks, and will have to trust the creature’s word. <br><br>“Even more secrets it seems to hold. Close blinds, douse lights. What does mushroom-glow reveal…?”<br><br>There is a moment where your eyes adjust to the darkness, but the lack of light doesn’t seem to impede the creature’s investigation. <br><br>“Look, see. Runes, embedded within fabric. Best not dwell on them too long.” <br><br>The room returns to light, but the examination is not yet finished. <br><br>“Curious. Tip is plain, not befitting of the rest… ah, loose, perhaps... removable? Indeed. Ah! More curious. Puncture wound wells with blood, yet needle-point remains unstained.”<br><br>The creature makes several jerky stabbing motions. “Balance not suited to combat, suggests… ritual purposes.”<br><br>The umbrella is returned to its wrappings, the creature handling it softly, almost reverentially. <br><br>“Curious. First glance – mundane object. Deeper inspection – beautifully wrought tool of necromancy. Where find you such exquisite treasure?”<br><br><br><br>A/N: So this one got a little odd (and not just with the idea of a necromantic umbrella). The creature&#39;s speech patterns were supposed emphasize how alien it was - I could have just described it more, but felt that that would be taking away from the core of the prompt.<br><br>-Irish</p>

            <p><br>The Timekeeper was not Death, as humans invisioned it, but it was one of the entities in charge of death. The Timekeeper, along with the two Archivists, kept track of when and where deaths would occur. The Timekeeper currently liked to take the shape of a small figure shrouded in black robes, and flitted around the room to constantly check the state of various soul channeling objects- small candles, a few hourglasses, the newer souls mostly having alarms. Needless to say, it was quite a large room. The Timekeeper interacted only with the Archivists, sending the twins messages in some undefined way whenever a soul was snuffed out. They were constantly in motion, which was a good thing, considering what they did. The Timekeeper was also thankful for their lack of need for sleep, which was quite convenient for their job, but Archivists thought that they probably needed an assistant.</p>

            <p>Prompt 1:<br><br>Death is very old, and over its long existence it been many things--male and female and neither, old and young and ageless, physical and ethereal.<br><br>But, for the moment, Death has taken the form of an older woman. She has light-brown skin and dark, curly hair starting to go gray; she is plump, wears gingham dresses and sensible shoes, and seems to be in constant motion. This is a good thing, since she has a lot of work to do. Escorting souls into the afterlife involves a lot of paperwork. Lately, she has been somewhat irritable due to overwork. She is thinking of taking on an assistant, so that she has the time to sit down, drink tea, and read a book.<br><br></p>

            <p>This feels a little like the setup for a modern fantasy AU of Terry Pratchett&#39;s Mort.</p>
