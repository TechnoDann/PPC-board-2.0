            <p>Okay, so I haven&#39;t actually played all of these, but they all have excellent reviews, which counts for something.<br><br>Star Wars Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy<br>Star Wars Jedi Knight 2: Jedi Outcast<br><br>These two older games are $3.50 each and, I&#39;m told, feature the best lightsaber combat of any Star Wars game. It also has first-person shooter elements and (of course) Force abilities.<br><br>Arma 3: Hardcore military simulator, with heavy emphasis on group tactics. Currently $13.59 for the base game or $23.79 for the Apex Edition (which includes a bunch of DLC). You&#39;re going to need a clan if you want to play seriously, but luckily there&#39;s a web page where you can search for open ones. I&#39;d only buy this game on sale because of how serious a commitment it is; a single mission can take an hour or more from briefing and role assignment to completion.<br><br>The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt<br>Excellent dark fantasy RPG, currently $20. I haven&#39;t played much of it (sadly), but what I&#39;ve played is absolutely perfect. Right now, the GOTY edition is the same price as the base game; effectively, all the DLC is free. Just make sure your computer is beefy enough to run it.</p>

            <p>Some things I can suggest:<br><br>-Mount and Blade: Warband: Okay, if you&#39;re here, you&#39;ll probably like Warband. It&#39;s a medieval RPG/Combat sim, and you can command armies and order around soldiers, and there&#39;s also a multiplayer mode that supports over 100+ man matches, and... what else do you want?<br><br>Maybe an active modding community, an expansion/new game/DLC thing where you play as a viking in a game version of RL Scandanavia, another expansion where you can fight in multiplayer set in the French Revolution? Because it has all that too.<br><br>-Civilization: It really doesn&#39;t matter which. Just... one of them. Do I even have to explain?<br><br>-Dawn of War I and standalone expansions (although Soulstorm is... not the best): Do you like RTS games? Do you like Warhammer 40k? If so, buy these. They&#39;re great.<br><br>-A game by Zachtronics: Really, any of them, provided you&#39;re a programmer. Save for Ironclad Tactics, they are some of the best puzzles for programmers out there.<br><br>-Strife, Veteran Edition: Strife is a proper, old-school shooter, built in the Doom engine. But it&#39;s also an RPG hybrid with an interconnected word, actual story, and voice acting, where Killing All the Things isn&#39;t always the best way to proceed.<br><br>-Quake (any of them), and Doom (1, 2, and 4): What can I say? These games are pure, absolute classics, have great campaigns (well, Quake 1 and the Dooms do, at least), great multiplayer (if you can set it up and find anyone online), and are just all-around fun.<br><br>-Half-Life: This one&#39;s a tad frustrating, but I&#39;ve been playing through it, and overall, I&#39;ve been enjoying quite a bit. Grab the sequel, while you&#39;re at it.<br><br>-Portal (and Portal 2): Go play some of the funniest games ever made. Great puzzles, as well.<br><br>-Psychonauts: Portal is funny. This is, too. It&#39;s a classic 3rd person platformer, mostly getting by on the writing alone, but there are some great levels here as well: The Milkman conspiracy stuck in my head for well over a decade, long after the name of the game it was attached to had faded. <br><br>-To The Moon: More of a visual novel than a game. Do you like crying? this is for you.<br><br>-N++: Remember N? did you like N? play this. It&#39;s good.<br><br>-Bastion, Transistor, and Pyre: Look, just anything Supergiant makes. Their games are gorgeous, play well, and have good stories, and that music and voice acting...<br><br>-The Stanley Parable: You probably know it already. It is good.<br><br>There is soooo much more. But that&#39;s what I&#39;m listing for now.</p>

            <p>In no particular order, as my brain feels scattered today:<br><br>I like how you&#39;ve presented the Shallot as one of those by-the-book, micromanaging <i>Office Space</i> bosses.  I mean, I <b>hate</b> him, and the wheedling way he talks, and his self importance, but I like the way you&#39;ve presented him.  It&#39;s well done.  I also love the very defining moment when he interrupts his agents bonding naturally to oversee some regimented bonding instead.  I also also loved seeing the reactions of the Board of Department Heads, noticeably put off from their usual calmness.<br><br>I like that you&#39;ve taken a Sue-tracking bracelet, something usually used as a source of at least light drama pertaining to a character&#39;s core personality and identity, and applied it in a way that turns the bracelet into pure slapstick comedy, and which ultimately isn&#39;t a judgment on the character it&#39;s a attached to, but only there due to a bureaucratic misinterpretation.  It&#39;s a fun change.  You also kept the times Bogbrush had to appease the tracker infrequent enough that I never <i>quite</i> knew when his dialogue was going to degenerate into advertisement, which gives all such instances the sense of interruption they need.<br><br>I like the way you handled the Cube.  From the scene that introduced it, I didn&#39;t expect it to turn out to be such a problem.  Heck, I was outright amused by the conversation between it and Karen.  But then, even after Karen moved to the new division, it kept getting mentioned, and kept getting mentioned, and I starting growing uneasy as I realized this wasn&#39;t more of the irreverent sort of comedy as the rest of the story, but an actual, serious problem that would need to be addressed eventually.  But I&#39;m also glad you dealt with it, at least part of the way, right here in this story, and also that the first step towards eradicating the Cube&#39;s mental effects from Karen was also the catalyst for the true bond-forming of the non-Flower portions of the team.<br><br>—doctorlit, drawing lots of uncomfortable connections between the Cube and the Tommyknockers right now</p>

            <p>Right! I really liked this. The characters were fun, and the juxtaposition of comedy and serious drama was pretty solid (and if you weren&#39;t expecting it... have you ever READ Scape&#39;s stuff? :-P).<br><br>Also, The Shallot is wonderfully hateable.

            <p>Because all I can think is that flash patch probably means something extremely rude in Heptapod. ^<em>~ (And not to knock KittyEden, but if you can find a <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=tea+stain+vector&amp;client=firefox-b-1&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbas=0&amp;source=lnt&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi99qDe5bTZAhWDVt8KHVKyCCcQpwUIIA&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=654&amp;dpr=1">vector-ish tea stain</a> you like in a solid color, I&#39;ll doctor up a higher-res version like the others on the wiki.)<br><br>But seriously, I enjoyed this story a lot. I was skeptical about a new division just on principle, but I love the idea of the SO and the Board making up some nonsense just to placate an annoying Plant and have somewhere to chuck people they don&#39;t know what else to do with. I believe there is precedent for this being exactly how they handle problems like this. ^</em>^<br><br>The (sub?)plot about Karen and the Cube kinda threw me, it being a very serious element in an otherwise very silly story, but in a way that makes me want to know more about it, not less. What <i>is</i> the Cube, really? Where does it come from? How real is it? Why Karen? Where is it now? Should we be worried? &#39;Cause we&#39;ve got people who can deal with that pudendum if necessary, just sayin&#39;.<br><br>If only our friendlier psychics weren&#39;t so well-behaved with their powers that they didn&#39;t notice the problem... or maybe the background psychic noise of HQ interfered, or the Cube is just good enough to mask itself from casual notice. Any number of possible explanations. ... Sorry, I digress.<br><br>The SEP field was a nice (temporary) solution to the problem, though, and the moment of everyone coming together as a team was just plain nice. {= )<br><br>Other things I liked... Caroline. The acronym NPC. Bogbrush and his Sue-tracker problem. The Shallot and his terrible personality. The fact that the NPCs are basically Buzzfeed.<br><br>Is there going to be an actual publication associated with this, by the way? Such things are a lot of work and difficult to sustain, history tells us, but even one or two issues as an example would be awesome. ^_^<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I&#39;m glad you liked the stuff involving Karen and the Cube. It was something of a sticking point for my betas, and the initial version was a <i>lot</i> darker, so I&#39;m pleased that it&#39;s intriguing rather than concerning. As things stand, the Cube is my attempt at figuring out what happens when partners are really, really mismatched in terms of power level and temperament, and it&#39;s a really nasty piece of work. The Cube picked Karen for no other reason than because Karen was there and the Cube wanted someone to control. It was something I had to get out of my system in an environment and manner that felt safe to me, and I knew there was a risk of it going <i>really</i> wrong. So I&#39;m glad it didn&#39;t.<br><br>I&#39;m also glad you liked how unrepentantly awful the Shallot is. He&#39;s based on every punchable new-media twerp  I&#39;ve found hanging around fashionable London boroughs like maggots on a picnic, and, well, you can&#39;t run a Buzzfeed churnalist content-output agency in HQ and <i>not</i> have it run by an Onion, can you? =]<br><br>Finally, the bottom right tea stain in <a href="https://image.shutterstock.com/z/stock-vector-watercolor-blots-from-coffee-or-tea-isolated-vector-illustration-284304035.jpg">this image</a> seems perfect for the flashpatch.<br><br>Thanks for the review, and I&#39;m glad you enjoyed it. Like it says in the disclaimer, the Shallot is open for everyone to use, and I&#39;d <i>love</i> to see Nume being forced to deal with him. =]</p>

            <p>Wow.  That was a ride.  I know nothing about <i>Warhammer</i> beyond, uh, memey pictures posted online, but I feel like you guys painted a good picture of the battles there, and the general mood of seriousness and pessimism that seems to be the thing, there.<br><br>I like that you&#39;ve brought together two very serious, somber, large-bodied men, and spent a lot of time developing an emotional bond between them.  In addition to their own ongoing character development, it makes a nice contrast with the Sue in this mission: one hulking space cyborg thinks only of himself and interacts with his fists, while our big PPC boys are supportive of each other and keep their violence in check until the moment it&#39;s needed.  Tom is also a welcome source of humor and light-heartedness throughout the mostly gloomy environments of the mission.<br><br>Little moments I liked: the warsheep, the Python chanting, Huinesoron&#39;s rant, and Tom&#39;s arrival on the battlefield, flanked by rock-and-roll speakers.<br><br>One typo I noticed: I believe you wanted &quot;gates <b>of</b> Bree&quot;?<br>&quot;. . . the agents hadn’t bothered to look ahead, and were suddenly yanked to the gates Bree with the abruptness of a poorly written transition.&quot;<br><br>—doctorlit, rebelling against imagining movieverse!Thorin in his mind&#39;s eye</p>

            <p>All typos fixed in both versions.<br><br>I hadn&#39;t thought about the contrast with our guys and Androch, but the importance of those bonds between battle-brothers is one of the things that makes the Horus Heresy novels really appealing to me, which does make Androch&#39;s selfishness even more irritating. It&#39;s not all big boys with big weapons destroying stuff because they can, like I thought it would be—there&#39;s a lot of real human emotion there, too. I mean, I&#39;m pretty sure soldiers everywhere really only fight for the people beside them when it comes down to it, and your average Space Marine is no exception. Which makes the whole thing extremely tragic, because nobody can ever have nice things, ever.<br><br>And one of the great things about the PPC is the opportunities it affords to throw people together who could never meet any other way and see what happens.

            <p>...You should see SeaTurtle. Alistair and Corellieth are adorable. :-)<br><br>And yeah, the human aspects of Space Marines, which the games do their best to claim don&#39;t exist, and the novels explore far better (yet another reason to prefer novel canon to &#39;dex canon, if you&#39;re counting), are what make them interesting characters. They&#39;re not brainless, they&#39;re not inhuman.

            <p>Is this the first completed mission in the Warhammer 40,000 continuum? If so, congratulations on breaking new ground. If not, the mission is still good and the wiki is inaccurate. </p>

            <p>If there are any others, I&#39;m not aware of them. It is funny, though, since there have been several agents from the 40k continuum and there are plenty of fans in the community. I feel like a total poser having my name on the first mission there, having only gotten into the Horus Heresy novels about a month before starting it, but it&#39;s been such fun I&#39;m glad it happened this way. ^_^<br><br>Was there anything in particular you liked about the story?<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I find the mission quite funny, what with elvish cursing and the &quot;one bloody caprine...&quot; line, and the badfic itself has some powerful strangeness, like the main character apparently having three hands, battle sheep, cheat leather, and the inexplicably funny misspelling that is Slaneesh. Also, I&#39;m  glad to see the 41st (31st?) millennium finally get a mission.</p>

            <p>I have a lot of practice at noticing the absurd and pushing it into the extremely absurd, but the trick is simply to always be asking yourself &quot;how would this be the <i>most</i> ridiculous?&quot; Preferably in a way that makes your characters <s>suffer</s> react in amusing ways. ^_^ The point, after all, is to <i>show</i> why bad writing is bad. That&#39;s the key difference between a mission and an MST.<br><br>Of course, it won&#39;t always work. Humor is subjective. But the best humor is based firmly in truth, so it&#39;s important to always be honest to the source material as you interpret it.<br><br>And remember that a lot of good stuff came about during rewrites. It doesn&#39;t happen by magic, it happens by thinking pretty hard about it. Comedy is serious business. {= )<br><br>So, basically, the Neshomeh Method is this:<br><br>1. Push the envelope.<br>2. Show, don&#39;t tell.<br>3. Be honest.<br>4. Keep pushing that envelope.<br><br>~Neshomeh, presenting this advice to the Board at large for posterity.</p>

            <p>I ope your spin-off will continue for long and be as fun as that mission was to read.<br><br>One thing though *Look again at te way the bit captain behaved*. Are you sure the captain you neuralized didn&#39;t decide to change name after the mission to something like... Cato Sicarius? Because cool spin-off or not, I&#39;f that&#39;s the case, I&#39;mm not sure I could forgive you for creating the Worst Ultrasmurf Ever.</p>
