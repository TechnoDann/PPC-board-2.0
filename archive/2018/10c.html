            <p>Scratch is insanely primitive, and I never jad much fun with it.

            <p>I have a hunch that more people get banned during then because all the Scratch Team-sponsored LGBT stuff makes those who are even mildly homophobic immediately come out of the woodworks so they can get banned or at least one step closer to being banned. It wouldn&#39;t be so bad if the folks affected didn&#39;t include all the little kids who don&#39;t yet understand how gender and sexuality works and make mistakes that get overreacted to by Scratch&#39;s LGBT+s and get the kids reported. (By the way, the whole of the LGBT+ people on the Board get my thanks for being so mature and such a breath of fresh air compared to Scratch.)<br><br>And yes, scratch.mit.edu&#39;s Community Guidelines actually do prohibit linking to other websites. But nobody enforces that. Except the time I got reported for asking a friend to get on Flockmod with me.<br><br>-Twistey</p>

            <p>I&#39;d actually heard about WolfenDoom before, as Sigma64 (the guy I met on Scratch who I told you about earlier) mentioned it while he was introducing me to more of the fandom. WolfenDoom itself is a bit too dark for me, though. There&#39;s a reason why I won&#39;t play anything later than the Wolf 3D era.<br><br>&#39;Fit makes you feel any better, I do know a little bit about Doom. I watch Aquarius199&#39;s videos about terrible Doom WADs from time to time, do you watch him? Thanks to his channel, I know what a Terry Trap is! :D<br><br>-Twistey<br>P.S. I have a theory that if said in a German accent, &quot;Thoth&quot; would sound like &quot;sauce.&quot; Think about that the next time you think about Wolfenstein... :D</p>

I just now watched the comment simulator (2nd link), and I&#39;d have to say both cringe warning, edge warning, and jumpscare-ish warning. If you want to avoid the jumpscare-ish (it&#39;s a Photoshop Flowey laugh), stop at the comment talking about &quot;Team Angel&quot; from an RP I was in. If you want to avoid the edge, stop when the music changes to the Pirate Invasion theme from Terraria.

            <p>I like these threads but it&#39;s always hard to decide which ones to recommend since I have so many...<br><br>My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic<br>*The Pony POV-verse by AlexWarlorn<br>Links: <a href="http://alexwarlorn.deviantart.com/gallery/32745467"><a href="http://alexwarlorn.deviantart.com/gallery/32745467">http://alexwarlorn.deviantart.com/gallery/32745467</a></a> (read these first), <a href="http://alexwarlorn.deviantart.com/gallery/32848832"><a href="http://alexwarlorn.deviantart.com/gallery/32848832">http://alexwarlorn.deviantart.com/gallery/32848832</a></a><br>A terrific story that takes an in-depth look at the affect Discord had on the characters and what comes after. It&#39;s more of a psychological look at the effects Discording would have on a pony... and the aftermath is not always pleasant. But the story is well-written and engaging, and incorporates previous My Little Pony series in an interesting way.<br>* Marionettes by Kendell <br>Link: <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11594755/1/Marionettes"><a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11594755/1/Marionettes">https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11594755/1/Marionettes</a></a><br>The story is a delightful skewering of the &quot;Villain of the Week&quot; trope with plenty of twists and turns. And it does incorporate canon... up to a point, anyway.<br><br>One Piece<br>*Marie D. Suesse and the Mystery New Pirate Age by Phalanx<br>Link: <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6328454/1/Marie-D-Suesse-And-The-Mystery-New-Pirate-Age"><a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6328454/1/Marie-D-Suesse-And-The-Mystery-New-Pirate-Age">http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6328454/1/Marie-D-Suesse-And-The-Mystery-New-Pirate-Age</a></a><br>this is a fic about Mary Sues... all the while taking a deconstructive, and even deep, look into the concept. I can&#39;t recommend this one enough for people who like Mary Sue deconstructions.<br><br>Harry Potter<br>*Wish Carefully by Ten Toes<br>Link: <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4356667/1/Wish-Carefully"><a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4356667/1/Wish-Carefully">https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4356667/1/Wish-Carefully</a></a><br>A delightfully cathartic read that points out the folly of the Death Eaters in a very satisfying way.<br><br>Crossovers<br>*Satellite Eyes by Geyhi<br>(Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Twilight)<br>Link: <a href="http://twispitefic.livejournal.com/21603.html"><a href="http://twispitefic.livejournal.com/21603.html">http://twispitefic.livejournal.com/21603.html</a></a><br>Why I like this one is obvious- Buffy shoots down all of Edward&#39;s attempts to be romantic in a very satisfying way.<br>*The Wedding Crashers by dasMervin<br>(Supernatural and Twilight)<br>Link: <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6721038/1/The-Wedding-Crashers"><a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6721038/1/The-Wedding-Crashers">https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6721038/1/The-Wedding-Crashers</a></a><br>A gloriously cathartic read as the Winchester brothers (and Castiel) poke holes into the vampires&#39; smug, self-aggrandizing ways.<br><br>And this is only a fraction of stories I like!<br></p>

            <p>It&#39;s called Antithesis, it is an AU of Harry Potter, but I believe it&#39;s well written.<br> Yes, it is a WBWL story, but it works well.

            <p>We got to talking about weird and bizarre animals in the Discord and there is not enough space in the world to describe my love of squid. Both fried, and swimming around in the ocean. <br><br>Squid are so freaking awesome, yo.<br><br>Listen, when you say a squid&#39;s got tentacles, they don&#39;t. Well, they do, but what you think are tentacles are actually arms. Squid got eight arms and two tentacles and octopuses only have eight arms, so squid are automatically better by like a fifth. Or something.<br><br>You know what their head is called? A <i>mantle</i>. It&#39;s not just a head, it houses all their squishy important bits. At the bottom of the mantle is their big nasty beak, surrounded by their arms and two tentacles, and it&#39;s not very good for playing the clarinet.<br><br>And inside the mantle is a little tube called a siphon, and squids slurp up water and spit it out very fast through the siphon to make themselves move, with their little arms and tentacles flailing behind them. Sometimes, the smaller species can siphon-shoot so fast they can literally fly out of the water, majestically, like an eagle piloting a blimp.<br><br>The siphon is controlled by a &quot;giant axon&quot;, and yes, that is the name they gave it because it&#39;s an axon and it&#39;s giant. And they don&#39;t really have a proper nervous system, just a giant axon system with a giant axon controlling most of it. Axons normally make up nerves, but with squids, they just skip the nerves part and just use axons. Efficient little buggers.<br><br>Squids&#39; brains are honestly the coolest thing about them, and I&#39;m not talking about their intelligence (though dear god are these Cthulhu-beings terrifyingly clever). No, I&#39;m talking about the shape. Squids have brains shaped like a donut, and the best part about it is their esophagus runs right through the brain, so every time they swallow, food literally passes through their brain on the way to the stomach. Brain food!<br><br>Also if they swallow too large a bite they&#39;ll get brain damage and die. This is why your parents told you to not wolf down your food, kids.<br><br><b>NSFW ahead!</b><br><br>Did you know squid have penises? Because they do. And now you know far more about squid than you ever wanted to know, but I&#39;m not done yet. Barnacles have the largest penis-to-body-size ratio in the entire animal kingdom, and of mobile animals, squids have the largest, putting them in second place in the animal kingdom. They put it inside the female&#39;s mantle to reproduce. <br><br>It literally just looks like two squids bumping heads together for a bit.<br><br>How lewd.<br><br><b>End NSFW</b><br><br>The smallest squid is the pygmy squid, and this cute little bugger doesn&#39;t even reach one whole gram of weight as an adult. The females are nearly twice as large as the males, reaching a length of 10.4mm/0.41in and 5.9mm/0.23in respectively. That&#39;s, like, smaller than my fingernail.<br><br>So tiny and smol. Delicate little beans. <br><br>Also, forget everything you know about giant squid, because I&#39;m here to tell you about COLOSSAL SQUID.<br><br>WHICH IS EVEN BIGGER THAN GIANT SQUID.<br><br>AND THEY HAVE HOOKED ARMS.<br><br>These guys regularly eff up sperm whales that try to make a meal out of them, and just as often as not end up eating the whale instead. Some of the hooks on their tentacles swivel, others are three-pronged, but the short of it is, Moby-Dick&#39;s not all scarred from the harpoon assassination attempts on his life. You can bet that big white bastard had a tussle with a colossal squid or two and they did not go down without a fight.<br><br>And now, to give you a bit of perspective, the largest octopus ever recorded was a Giant Pacific Octopus that weighed 600 pounds and was thirty feet across; the species as a whole tend to hover around 110 pounds and measure 16 feet across. <br><br>The largest colossal squid (push off, giant!) ever found was a female that weighed a whopping 1,091 pounds and measured 4.2m/14ft in length. And that&#39;s honestly an underestimate for how freaking enormous this beast of a cephalopod is, because the scientists who measured her dorked it up and they think she shrunk after death.<br><br>Now take into account that we&#39;ve only had a very, very tiny snapshot of the colossal squid as a species and what they found was honestly probably on the <i>small</i> end of the scale since it was so close to the surface. Based on that, the current speculation places this beast of the deep averaging at 14 <b>meters</b>—not feet like the largest species ever found, I mean <i>meters</i>, which is 46 feet in freedom units, and a scale-breaking 1,650 pounds.<br><br>You wanna know why they&#39;re so big? It&#39;s called abyssal gigantism, which is a totally awesome name for &quot;things that live really deep get bigger and bigger the farther down you go&quot;. The eyeball alone of the tiny biggest recorded specimen was likely 16 inches across when the squiddle was still alive. And then the entire squid shrunk because them scientists couldn&#39;t preserve the find of the century properly. Boo. The beast honestly very likely measured closer to 6 meters/20 feet in length when it was still alive, but I guess we have no way of knowing now, do we? &gt;:(<br><br>Colossal squid are freaking epic and that is why squids, and colossal squids in particular, are my favorite marine animal of all time.<br><br>*mic drop*</p>

            <p>Things down deep come in two configurations: either sturdy enough to withstand the horrible pressures and cold (like whales) or gelatinous enough to not be crushed (like most everything else down there).<br> <br>Giant/Colossal squids are an exception to the rule because their bodies are laced with ammonia, which maintains a constant pressure at any depth. <br>This also makes giant/colossal squid quite inedible. Didn&#39;t stop people from trying anyways.<br><br><b>Even more NSFW facts</b><br>Some squid species reproduce by having a male swimming next to a female, loading tiny harpoons with a flesh boring acid/semen tandem &quot;warhead&quot;, firing the harpoons at the female and then swim away. The acid cuts through the female&#39;s flesh and the semen, now injected into her bloodstream, will find its way.<br>Yes, that is indeed drive-by rape.<br><b>NSFW facts end here</b><br><br>If I recall, larger (1+meters long) squids currently have zero human casualties to their name. Not for lack of trying, though, as Humboldt squids have been known to attack divers.<br>This is of course not including stories of krakens attacking and sinking ships, which are unlikely at best.<br><br>Giant squids have the largest brains amongst invertebrates. How smart does this make them is currently not known.</p>

        <div class="post-body">
            <p>Since I don&#39;t read fanfic that much outside of certain contexts, I actually hadn&#39;t heard of WBWL before, so it was new to me. But anyway, when your post then introduced me to the concept, I thought to myself: &quot;A prophetic hero whose twin is mistaken for the prophetic hero? That sounds like something I&#39;d write!&quot; Except I&#39;d obviously write it into an original world, and make the one who&#39;s not the hero the protagonist of the story, et cetera you&#39;ll see how I interpreted the general premise below.<br><br>So I came up with this activity that&#39;s kind of a cross between Round Super Robin (hS, BRING THAT BACK!!!) and Fill the Plothole, based around the idea of taking a trope from fiction or fanfiction and actually writing it well, with or even without the transport to an original story. What one does is take one or two tropes from the game&#39;s list of tropes (which I shall start below) and write a fanfic or story premise stemming from a skillful reinterpretation of it, then come up with a new trope to replace the old one in the list, and put it at the end of the post. Those who feel inspired by a particular premise another person made can write one-shots or scenes as they please.<br><br>So, here&#39;s an example where the result is original fiction:<br><br><b>Trope:</b> WBWL<br><b>Title:</b> <i>The World Belongs to Amalie</i><br><b>Premise (pitched like on the back of a book):</b><br><i>They&#39;ve got the wrong girl!</i><br>Kate and her twin sister Amalie are two girls growing up in a world where such things as warriors and sorcerers roamed long ago. On the last day of summer, Kate receives a surprising message: she has to transfer to a special academy because she is the heroine of an ancient prophecy. The only problem is, Kate knows she&#39;s not the real heroine - it&#39;s Amalie, who Kate has seen fulfill the first part of the prophecy by developing magic powers. Kate would do anything for her sister, and it&#39;s killing her to see how unhappy Amalie is at having her special destiny unrecognized. But it seems like no one can be convinced that quiet Amalie could possibly be fated for greatness, and Kate fears that it might send her down a dark path...<br><b>Other Info:</b> The part of the prophecy that had to do with which of the twins was the heroine was mangled in translation - maybe one has a feature that the other doesn&#39;t and the prophecy originally said the twin who doesn&#39;t have it but the translation says the twin that does, or vice versa. Also, in case it&#39;s not clear from the description, this isn&#39;t so much of an urban fantasy setting as it is a post-high fantasy kind of world, if that makes any sense - it&#39;s the result of what happens when a high fantasy society undergoes all the societal development that our world has.<br><br>And here&#39;s an example of one where the result is fanfiction, in this case Creepypasta fanfiction:<br><br><b>Trope:</b> OC x Jeff<br><b>Title:</b> <i>Chasing Jeff the Killer</i><br><b>Premise:</b><br>One had a crush on him in high school, but was never able to confess before it was too late. Now a criminal psychologist, she’s determined to fix him. The other is his partner in crime, and just as determined to get into his pants. Ten years after Jeff started killing, two women are fighting to decide his fate.<br><b>Other Info:</b> I wish I had a scene prepared for this. If I did, it would be NSFW, because my really disheveled adult Jeff and his OC partner-in-crime-then-mistress both curse like sailors. The psychologist doesn&#39;t &quot;win&quot; the fight for Jeff, but she still gets a happy ending: Jeff and his mistress are imprisoned, and the psychologist realizes that he&#39;s just not worth it anymore.<br><br>Now here&#39;s the list of tropes we&#39;ll begin with!<br>-The protagonist, a teenage girl, learns she&#39;s not human. (YA novels)<br>-The protagonist&#39;s love/hand/body is sought after by a significant number of people. (Fanfic and, of course, the entire genre of harem anime)<br>-The story has an ensemble cast, and every protagonist has their own antagonist to fight. (Not sure if it&#39;s a trope, but it was one of the more retrospectively humorous things about the RP group I was in some years ago.)<br>-The story&#39;s title is &quot;[Big Bad&#39;s name here]&#39;s [something].&quot; (Er, historical fiction and nonfiction... let&#39;s leave it at that. The tricky bit about this one is that for it to work, people have to know that the name they&#39;re looking at is that of the Big Bad. Which is part of why you don&#39;t see it anywhere else!)<br>-Love is a literal power. (Stories aimed at kids and teens)<br>-The protagonists, while they&#39;re not going saving the world and possibly going to school, have a band or idol group. (Magical girls in both anime and Western cartoons)<br><br>So, let the game begin! Have fun, everyone!<br>-Twistey</p>

            <p>So this is a story idea that I’ve been entertaining for some time, but I never actually got around to writing it; <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/13C1uK1X3coWktdIT5IcAYKB3jCiBpa3ZJkeAqB6Bwhg"><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/13C1uK1X3coWktdIT5IcAYKB3jCiBpa3ZJkeAqB6Bwhg">https://docs.google.com/document/d/13C1uK1X3coWktdIT5IcAYKB3jCiBpa3ZJkeAqB6Bwhg</a></a><br>Adding on to what’s in the docs, so- this is going to be long, possibly over complicated, and maybe a bit weird. So it’s about these two foster sisters, and one is supposedly the hero from some prophecy, and also has Suvian Traits, and the other, who is bitter, jealous, and likely to betray her foster sister, is sent with her to defeat the villain, but then they find out somewhere along the journey that they are actually twins, and the Sue has only half a soul.<br><br>And then they find out that the villain thinks the “darker” twin is the hero of the prophecy and it’s just very confusing.<br><br>And THEN they find their mom, who got captured by the villain, and she tells them that she only had one kid?<br><br>So they just loop back to the guy who told them that the Sue has only half a soul, and it turns out  the other twin also has half a soul?<br><br>So it’s just like... they’re the same person, holy sh*t.<br><br>And after they defeat the villain, they spend a long, long, time figuring out what to do, because they grew up differently, and they have different views on the world and friends and stuff, and... yeah.</p>

            <p>One suggestion I have is that you should probably cut down on the Suvian traits for Destiny, since the story doesn&#39;t sound like it&#39;s a parody, and also, you really shouldn&#39;t refer to anything non-PPC as a &quot;Suvian&quot;, because it&#39;s terminology exclusive to us, and outsiders would either be confused or look it up and discover us. Unless your story is a parody, the types of people who read it won&#39;t be limited to the types of people who we want here/who won&#39;t yell at us for existing.<br><br>Another suggestion: Perhaps you should expand a bit on what genre this is in, so that you either have a justification for Destiny&#39;s strange last name or (if it&#39;s urban fantasy), you can change the name. Behindthename.com has a joint site with last names in it, so if you want to, you can start there.<br><br>Finally: Expand on what a Focus is. Aside from the band. *BEGINS YODELING* :D<br><br>-Twistey<br>(The yodeling was a reference to this song, which I consider my personal theme song: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MV0F_XiR48Q"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MV0F_XiR48Q">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MV0F_XiR48Q</a></a>)</p>

            <p>So basically a Focus is your magic.<br><br>Well, technically, you’re able to do any type of magic, but there’s always this one type of magic that you’re better at than the rest, so either you find out on accident or there are these people that test you for it when you’re about six or seven years old, and then learning about it becomes a part of your normal education.</p>

            <p>The annual PPC Halloween party was slowly ramping up. In the back, tables were piled high with candies, cakes, and more substantial food for those feeling responsible; the punch gave off an eerie green glow. There was an array of tables filling about half the room, at which several agents were sitting and talking. Technician Tomash had just finished setting up the jack-o-lantern speakers, which had been dug out of a closet somewhere for the occasion, and was now off hiding in a corner somewhere.</p>

            <p>"So, what do you think?" The Cybertronian asked his companion. Several panels of grey-painted cardboard were strapped to the vending machine, giving him the vague appearance of a Gameboy. His human partner was wearing a blue coat with white fur trim along its hood and currently munching on a hot dog. He swallowed it and pulled down his skull mask.</p>

<p>"Yeah it ain't bad. How's mine?"</p>

<p>"You made that out of stuff you had lying around, at least I had to actually fabricate something." </p>

<p>"Perhaps, but being lazy is consistent with the character I am portraying, so there's really no bones about it."</p>

<p>The Cybertronian blinked a few times. "Did...you just...".</p>

<p>"Anyways." The human in the last minute costume started to head into the party. "There's no need for us to be a couple of lazy bones. We're gonna have a good time."</p>

            <p>She burst through the doors and sashayed her way toward the crowd, grinning, fully expecting the entire room to stop and stare... only to realize about five steps in that her partner was not beside her. <i>What the hell?</i> She turned around and saw that he was still in the doorway, standing stock-still. With an aggravated growl, she stalked back toward him.</p>

<p>"Hey!" she hissed. "What gives?"</p>

<p>"This was a bad idea," said Derik, shaking his head. "I don't know why I ever thought this was a <i>good</i> idea."</p>

<p>Gall was confused. "What, the party?" She thought he'd been looking forward to it.</p>

<p>"No, no. This." His gesture included the two of them and what they were wearing—or, largely, not wearing.</p>

<p>His costume was fine. He was Jason Momoa's Aquaman. He didn't have the beard, but he had brushed some temporary gold highlights into his hair, which was almost the right length, and he had quite enjoyed letting Gall stencil the intricate, Polynesian-inspired fake tattoos all over his upper body. His only actual clothing at the moment was a pair of low-cut dark green leather pants. That was all fine on its own.</p>

<p>It was Gall's costume that made the whole thing a terrible, crass joke. It had been funny when they were planning it in the response center, but now, in public...</p>

<p>She wasn't wearing much on top herself, just a bandeau with a pair of pink seashells fitted to her breasts. Below, sparkling green leggings with frilly bits suggestive of fins floating around her calves. (She hadn't for one moment considered an actual dress.) She'd even wetted her hair and brushed it out until it was relatively smooth and reached to her upper back.</p>

<p>None of this did a single thing to hide the unmistakable bulge of her belly.</p>

<p>As far as she was concerned, that was the point. It was the coup de grace of the joke. Also, she was thrilled about her pregnancy, and as she'd entered her fourth month, she'd gotten a surge of energy that made her more irrepressible than ever. She was excited. She was proud. She <i>glowed</i>. She wanted everyone to notice.</p>

<p>Derik was excited and proud, too, sometimes. Mostly, and at this particular moment, he was terrified.</p>

<p>"Well, you can't back out now," Gall said. "Not after all the work I put in!"</p>

<p>He really, really wished he could, but she was right. As much as he wanted to run away, doing so would be at least as shameful as whatever attention was about to come his way.</p>

<p>But perhaps there was a middle road. "I'm not backing out," he said, and even took a step into the room to prove it, letting the doors close behind him. "Do you want anything? Food? Water?"</p>

<p>She narrowed her eyes at him in suspicion, but biology got the better of her. She tilted her head. "You know what's weird? Remember those horrible fried green goo things from last year?"</p>

<p>"Yes?" He wasn't actually sure he did; a lot of the latter half of last year's party was fuzzy.</p>

<p>"I could so demolish a plate of those right now."</p>

<p>Derik smiled. "I'll see if they're there." He turned to abscond.</p>

<p>"Ooh, and maybe if there's haggis? That's a scary Halloweenish food, right?"</p>

<p>He had to look back. "Really?"</p>

<p>Gall scowled and put her hands on her befrilled hips. "Don't you dare judge my cravings."</p>

<p>"Never!" He put up his hands, <i>don't shoot</i>, and made his escape. If he could just set her up with some snacks and then avoid her the rest of the evening, maybe everything would be fine...</p>

<p><br>
(( To the people who didn't know my secret plans: Surprise! This is a thing that is happening and was never not a thing that was going to happen.</p>

<p>(( If he doesn't run into anyone else first, I'll send Derik over to Ix and Charlotte's thread with the food table. Due to conflicting canonicity and the convenient excuse that he was kinda blitzed, he doesn't really remember anything that happened with Ix, so that should be interesting. ∗eg∗ ))</p>

<p>Ix had finally started to relax when they made it to the food table without anyone staring. Well, there had been a bit of staring, but when one of the stare-ers had called out "Nice costumes!", she grinned and actually called back "Thank you!"</p>

<p>"You seem like you're enjoying yourself," Charlotte remarked. </p>

<p>Ix touched her mask, shrugging. "It's just... easier like this," she said. "I don't have to worry about people asking awkward questions, like—"</p>

<p>"Oh my <em>gosh</em> look at you two!" Charlotte said when something green and glittery caught her notice from the corner of her eye. And then her mouth fell open when she properly took in Gall's appearance.</p>

<p>Ix, for her part, froze with a Battenberg cake halfway to her mouth, staring at Derik like a deer caught in the headlights.</p>

He stifled a groan, gave a weak (not to say watery) smile, and raised a hand in acknowledgement, then gave his entire attention to piling a plate with anything that met his standards of nutritional value. Cravings or not, that was his child in there, and he was feeding it as well as he could.</p>

<p>Gall, meanwhile, was grinning fit to bust at the reaction. "Hey, thanks! You're, uh..." She snapped her fingers a few times, thinking. "What's her face... Buttercup? And the Dread Pirate Westley, right?"</p>

            <p>Charlotte curtseyed neatly, beaming from ear to ear. "Though nobody would really fear the Dread Pirate Westley. The Dread Pirate Roberts, on the other hand..."</p>

<p>"I'm not worrying, I'm just making small talk," Charlotte protested. "You guys were Green Lantern and Hawkwoman last year, right?"</p>

            <p>Gall squinted at the pair. "Do we know you?" The one in the mask was no help, and the blonde was...</p>

<p>A blonde? And a mask? The penny dropped. "Waaaiiit, are you the ones who got Derik to make a total ass of himself last year?" She grinned as she said it. "Because if you were, don't get me wrong, that was hilarious apart from the sulking."</p>

<p>Derik, who'd been steadily making his way along the table, glanced up when the sound of his name caught his ear over the background noise of the room. He did not like the looks he was getting at all. He sidled further down the line of food.</p>

            <p>The precise definition of their relationship, whatever it was, had never factored into her pursuit of it. None of the words she could think of were quite correct by themselves, so she threw out correctness, shrugged, and said proudly, "We're f---ing. This here?" She ran a hand over her belly. "That guy." She nodded toward Derik. "First time! At least, I'm pretty sure it was the first time. He was all skittish for a while afterward, and Medical says the little sucker's definitely four months now." She stroked her bump fondly.</p>

            <p>At best, Gall was too pleased with herself to realize she was probably making everyone in earshot uncomfortable. At worst, she didn't care. "They tell me it's a boy. Still can't believe you can actually know that already." She shook her head, then leaned in with a confidential air. "Hey, what do you think for a name: 'Dogbreath' or 'Burrfoot'? I had the first one in mind for a boy <i>or</i> a girl, but the second one is a family name, so...?"</p>

<p>Derik was in the middle of dishing up some of what he was pretty sure were sweet potatoes swirled with black food coloring and nearly lost a spoonful when he jumped—he was too focused, and Ix had come up quietly on his right. "Ah, shards, sorry," he muttered back, replacing the spoon and stepping out of the way. He looked toward Gall, confirming that this was one of the people she'd been talking to. With his free hand, he rubbed the spot between his eyebrows. "I know that look on her face. Whatever she's been saying, it was wrong and I apologize."</p>

<p>It took Charlotte a moment to remember Gall's home continuum. "Well, I think Dogbreath is pretty good for where you come from," she said. "But it doesn't sound like something that'd fit Derik's home continuum?" She hugged herself, trying to ignore the gnawing feeling in her chest.

I'm pretty sure this kid is safe from goblins here, so I don't mind breaking with tradition." She snickered some more, but then her face softened. "Nah, but for real, I know what his name is. It'll be good. Don't tell Derik, though. I can still get him sometimes if I trot out the really old ones, like Hugefarts."</p>

<p>Derik, blissfully unaware of the content of the conversation, regarded Gall with a mixed expression. "She does have her moments," he said, then shook himself and turned back to Ix. "I'm sorry. Did you want to talk to me, or...?"</p>

<p>"You're not," Derik assured Ix. He gave the masked agent a curious look. Something about the cadence of her voice was tugging at a memory, but it refused to surface. He shook his head. "Well, I had better take this over. If I'm lucky, I can get her settled down and go pretend I'm not an idiot for half an hour or so." He gave Ix a little half-smile to show he was kidding—mostly—and walked back. On the way, he paused to snag a pair of suspiciously neon-colored fritters.</p>

<p>Gall snorted. "You've instilled plenty in me."</p>

<p>There was a very subtle twitch in Derik's cheek. It was likely stress, but quite possibly he was refusing to laugh at that in front of a presumed-nice presumed-stranger.</p>

            <p>For a moment, Gall lapsed into complete seriousness. "That would suck."</p>

<p>"And space is certainly an issue," Derik added. "The paperwork to request a move is insane, and Building Maintenance won't give me permission to knock down a wall..."</p>

<p>"So Plan C is to find an empty RC—one of the big ones—and just tack our number to it." Gall, who was a Viking, after all, grinned. "My girl Gremlin can even fix the console, so no one will know the difference. Oh, and speaking of Bad Slash hookups: if you really wanna do the whole nine-months thing, there's always one or two little bean sprouts that've been debugged and could use a surrogate. They've got the tanks, but..." Gall made a face that eloquently expressed her disgust with the idea. "It'd be a lot more like it was your own that way, right?"</p>

<p>Derik's mouth pulled tight in a grimace. The actual memories remained incoherent, but the bitter emotions flooded back. He took a breath. <i>Benden, Boll, Hanrahan, Ping, Telgar, Tillek...</i> The silent litany was a touchstone that enabled him to refocus and enter a new state of mind, both more aware of and removed from his surroundings. It had taken him the better part of a year to gain a command of the technique. He looked at Ix, nervous and keeping her distance, then back to Charlotte, beginning to bristle. Understandable.</p>

<p>He handed the plate of food off to Gall. She proceeded to examine it.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid it's all a blur," said Derik, "but please allow me to apologize properly for everything I said and did that was inappropriate or upsetting." He gave a deep bow, extending one arm to include Ix in the gesture. "I can't claim I wasn't myself, but I was walking a dangerous path then. I have found a better one now.

<p>Ix stopped at a relatively safe distance from Derik, studying him warily. After a moment, she held out a hand with a nervous smile.</p>

<p>Derik wasn't quite sure what Ix intended, but he reached back and gently took her fingers. "I disappointed you, I know that much. I am sorry. The truth is, I'm not fit to be anyone's mentor." His control faltered, and he couldn't stop the flicker of his eyes toward Gall. He was, however, able to keep the unrelated terror from intruding further. "Perhaps a friend?"</p>

<p>Gall's attention appeared to be focused on picking dubiously through the selections on her plate.</p>

<p>Charlotte nudged her. "It's okay to say yes, hon."</p>

<p>"Er... in that case..." Ix smiled, though it still looked nervous. "Yes."</p>

            <p>Derik smiled back, equally unsure. He had no idea what to do next, either—all his friendships in the PPC up until Thoth had been based around competition or drinking or both, and no relationship with a Space Marine could ever be called normal. This was new territory. A lot of that was happening to him lately.</p>

<p>"So like," Gall's voice rose, "my relationship with food is weird right now because hormones and all, but for starters... Derik, what the hell is <i>this?</i>" She prodded a pile of goop with green bits.</p>

<p>"Er." Derik looked. "Spinach dip?"</p>

<p>"Okay. This is the worst. Avoid this. It smells like feet and shame and it is making me literally sick." She handed the plate back to Derik. "I'll get my own."</p>

<p>He sighed, lips pressed together, and said nothing. No amount of mental training was enough to deal with this.</p>

<p>"Ah... A pirate of some sort, then, Agent Ix? I am... unsure. I imagine it would be a matched set with Charlotte, but that, too, I cannot be certain of." His gaze turned to the other agent. "Brother Derik, you look most handsome. I confess to having noticed your partner's costume already. I trust that both she and the child are doing well?"</p>

            <p>Derik didn't try to hide his relief at his brother's arrival. He could have hugged the other man, but settled for extending his hand to clasp his wrist (which involved half Derik's arm being gripped in return).</p>

<p>"Yes," he answered the question addressed to him, "both in fine fettle. Gratingly so." He wondered if Thoth got the bad joke that was their costumes. Likely not, which was one more reason Derik was pleased to see him.</p>

<p>He meant to turn back to Ix, but he'd been studying Thoth's costume and realized what it was. There was a moment while his response hung in the balance. A year ago, he might have taken it as a jab, more salt in his wounds, a thoroughly unexpected betrayal. But now, from Thoth, such a thing was quite impossible.</p>

<p>The scales tipped. He laughed softly. "Well now, brother. I have to applaud your attention to detail. What did you use? Not actual wherhide...?"</p>

<p><br>
Gall snorted. "Thought you said you didn't know anything. I'm not saying you're wrong," she went on. "Hell, I might like it tomorrow. Right now, though, it's all about these things." She'd made a bee-line for what had turned out to be fried Kool-Aid in various flavors. "Also, that's hilarious." She pointed out a tin of ribs and cocktail wieners arranged to look like an open human torso with a cheekily grinning skull set at the top. It had already been picked at, so it looked particularly desiccated.</p>

<p><br>
(( "They gripped wrists in the manner of warriors" and variations on the same —approximately every other page in some HH books, to the point it's an innuendo-licious in-joke. You're welcome. ˆ_~ [Unless you're Agent Ix, in which case I'm sorry, the rampant unstoppable ship-fuel is being very rude.]</p>

<p>Ix glanced up, feeling very small. She wasn't short by any stretch, but next to Derik and especially Thoth, she was tiny. "No, I'm... it's just..." She glanced around, hunching her shoulders. "Parties," she muttered. "Not really a fan, but Lottie wanted to go together."</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>"I don't know <em>much</em>," Charlotte corrected. "I'm now very intimately acquainted with cottage pie, lasagne, pork tenderloin, and..." She shuddered. "Calamari." She reached over and grabbed a rib, inspecting it. "So, do I just eat the meat off the bone, then?"</p>

<p>Derik, who actually possessed social faculties and could use them on a good day, took a moment to explain: "We sidelined her, Thoth." Then he addressed Ix: "Sorry. I can relate, I think. Pernese festivities usually include some organized entertainment, so guests know what to do with themselves. These Terran-style affairs are so shapeless, it's easy to feel adrift without someone to take you up in their wake. ... And the music is awful," he added in a low grumble. Not about to go off on that, he instead occupied his mouth with some of the food on what was now apparently his plate.</p>

<p><br>
"Yep!" Gall confirmed. "And if you don't get the sauce all over your face, you're doing it wrong. I'm not even punking you; that's a bone-afide fact."</p>

            <p>Ix cocked her head, listening. "Okay, yeah, this song is pretty bad," she admitted. "At least there's no dancing. Might as well have two left feet," she added, grimacing.

"It's <em>really</em> warm in here."</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>Charlotte grinned and began nibbling on the ribs, her eyes fluttering shut in appreciation. "Oh, <em>man</em>, this is good." She paused, grinning, eyes still closed. "Bone-afide. That's pretty hilarious."</p>

<p>At Thoth's question, he smiled grimly. "You don't want to get me started on that. Not right now, anyway. We'd be here all night, and no one else has the transhuman patience necessary to listen to me rattle on for that long. Why don't we return to an earlier topic? Ix, you're Westley from <i>The Princess Bride</i>, aren't you? I don't think we've made Thoth watch that one yet, but it's up there with the Pythons in the echelons of required canon, or so I was led to believe. Would you like to tell us about the character?" He made the question as gently inviting as possible.</p>

<p><br>
Gall's grin stretched wide. This could be <i>fun</i>. "Hmm... if you liked that... looks like there's some hot wings over here. Wanna test out your spice tolerance?"</p>

(( For the record, I spent a lot of time between posts coming up with screeds on the topic of so-called "popular" "dance" music, so this is not me avoiding the topic.

            <p>"Haven't you seen enough Suefics by now to know that one's true love is usually a person for us mere mortals?" he said, grinning. "A girl, in this case. The fair country maiden Buttercup, loved by Westley, but desired and captured by the foul Prince Humperdinck during Westley's absence. Westley is gone so long that Buttercup becomes despondent and agrees to marry Humperdinck, but then Westley returns, and determines to save her with the help of a rag-tag band of misfits. Comedic shenanigans ensue. Thoth, I reckon you'd appreciate the battle of wits between Westley and the Sicilian outlaw Vizzini. And Inigo Montoya—surely you've heard someone quote him at some point?" He put on a fair imitation of Mandy Patinkin's Spanish accent: "Hallo! My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die!" His mock-lunge was lackluster due to needing to balance his plate in one hand. Addressing Ix, he added, "Did you know his actor was also a Broadway performer? Quite a good singer, too... for a tenor." He gave a partial wink, more a twitch of his cheek so as not to fully close his one good eye.</p>

<p><br>
Gall regarded Charlotte with deep suspicion. "... Huh. I wonder if there's anything hotter. Some of these things have really goofy names and bottle designs that would fit in with all the skulls and stuff, like the Ass Reaper. Someone might've been sadistic enough to leave some lying around." She started searching the table, but was quickly distracted. "Ooh, pumpkin pie! That's got a vegetable in it, so it's technically healthy." She served herself a generous slice.</p>

<p>His companion shifted the fur cape hanging from his right shoulder, then smiled up at the first man. "Oh, don't worry about that," he said. "It'll be fine, and even if something does happen, we're Agents. We know how to handle ourselves."</p>

<p>The frown the man dressed as a slightly-more-practical (he wasn't going to leave his thighs bare) Chandra Nalaar bore lessened slightly. "You may have a point," he admitted. "I have not yet uncovered anything suggesting anything similar shall occur." <i>Yet being the key word.</i></p>

<p>The man dressed as Liliana, Last Hope of Innistrad turned his attention to the room at large. "There, you see? If something was going on, you of all people would have found it." He looked around, hoping to see someone he might know. "Now, let's enjoy ourselves."</p>

<p><hr></p>

<p>"How does she <i>see</i> through these things?" growled Apecian, brushing his currently reddish-pink bangs out of his eyes for what felt like the thousandth time that night. "It's gotta be magic!"</p>

<p>"It is probably science, actually," Michael said, a slight smile playing across his face. He seemed perfectly at ease in his formal white-and-gold shirt and black pants, unlike Apecian, who was still getting used to moving in what amounted in a wedding dress.</p>

<p>"No, she's a - waaaait a minute." His irritation vanished and he grinned at his partner. "Okay, yeah, it's science. Guess her dad really planned ahead, huh?"</p>

<p>"She was meant to be a perfect perpetual combat machine," Michael pointed out. "It would be a rather large oversight to just... let her die because she refused to cut her hair."</p>

<p>The second smiled at Elanor when she spoke. He glanced at Zeb, and those ears did look like they might be vaguely lionlike. Maybe. Sort of. "Well, since you know who we are tonight, who are you dressed as?" he asked the small girl.</p>

<p>The Aviator was by her side in a flash. "Elanor, we don't pull hair," she said, taking the Time Tot from Dilx's arms. Elanor screwed up her face, looking like she was about to throw a tantrum, but the Aviator put a finger on Elanor's lips, beginning to hum.</p>

            <p>"Oh, don't worry," he said. "I know how hatchlings can be, and she didn't even pull anything out. Which isn't to say you shouldn't be trying to get her to stop!" he added hastily. "It's definitely a good idea, just - you know. I'm not about to start shedding early about it." He then blushed, realizing that that probably sounded really, <i>really</i> weird to somebody without scales. </p>

<p>Animus bumped against him slightly, and Dilx's blush faded slightly. "How old is Elanor?" the taller man asked. "While I admit to my own experiences in the area being rather atypical, what I recall of most children implies they should not be communicating at her level at her apparent age."</p>

<p>"Time Lords mature more quickly," the Aviator said, rejoining them. Elanor was fast asleep in her arms, face buried against the crook of the Aviator's neck. "Well... not exactly. In terms of intelligence, perhaps, but emotionally..." She kissed the top of Elanor's head. "She's still just a toddler like any other."</p>

            <p>"She must be quite the handful," he said quietly. No need to risk waking the child if she wasn't much of a heavy sleeper. "A two-year-old with the wits of one several years their senior is not one I would be quick to volunteer raise. And yet, it seems the three of you are doing admirably well, particularly given the circumstances." Dilx shot Animus a questioning look. The red-headed man pressed his fingers lightly to his partner's elbow and said, even more softly, "TARDISes are, as memory serves, sapient, and thus might be of assistance in the matter, and while Headquarters has its advantages, it cannot be an easy place to raise a child." It wouldn't have surprised Animus if he could be heard, but it was more the spirit of the effort than anything else that made him lower his voice anyways, so he didn't mind.</p>

            <p>This rumbling proclamation from the towering posthuman did little to discourage his young human companion.  “Leonidas. We’ve already been over this.  As far as I know, Dozle Zabi is the only character from the franchise with a build remotely similar to yours.”</p>

<p>The Space Marine, the one the (much) smaller of the two Agents referred to as Leonidas, shrugged his massive shoulders. The oversized uniform of a Zeon officer seemed to be struggling to contain the warrior’s powerful form, as if at any moment he might erupt from it as a wild creature more beast than man.  “Very well, Samuel.  Who are you impersonating again?</p>

<p>“Just call me Sammy, I really don’t mind,” answered the gold-haired human boy at his side. The youth’s gray eyes peered up at his counterpart through a pair of pilot’s goggles.  “I’m Quatre, remember? Pilot of the Gundam Sandrock?”  The gleam of excitement in Sammy’s eyes touched a buried memory and the Space Marine’s flint-hard gaze softened slightly.  "Very well..let's go." With that, they wandered into the room.</p>

<p>"Indeed you would," noted Ialthos. "...And while I've only had minor diplomatic experience, I'm pretty sure you never say that sort of thing to anyone you've just met. Ever."</p>

<p>"...Oh. Ah... right." Ferrux looked briefly abashed, but it didn't stick; he'd never been abashed for longer than 0.5 seconds in his life. "Anyways, Hallo the to the both of you! I'm Ferrux, fearsome dragon currently pretending to be Japan's vision of a Greek hero. Whatever "Japan" and "Greek" are..."</p>

            <p>Leonidas nodded solemnly to the newly introduced pair.  "Leonidas of the Dark Angels, currently in the garb of one Admiral Dozle Zabi of the Principality of Zeon." 
"Your disguise is well made,  Ferrux.  I would not have suspected you to be a dragon," he rumbled.  Sammy facepalmed at this. "And...Greek? Did you mean Grecian?  I was once told my name was taken from a Grecian hero of the ancient days."
As Ialthos spoke the words 'Knight-Errant', the Space Marine's brow furrowed in slight confusion.  <em>He doesn't appear to be a Knight Titan.</em>  He shrugged again.  "I was, long ago, a knight of sorts myself. In a way, I never stopped being one."</p>

<p>Seeing that his partner was unsure what to say beyond that, Sammy cleared his throat. "I'm Sammy. Sammy McLeod, home canon is Gundam Build Fighters.  Right now I'm dressed as Quatre Raberba Winner from Mobile Suit Gundam Wing--a similar canon that existed as an anime series in my setting."  He grinned. "I like to think that I pass for Quatre pretty well other than my eyes being the wrong color. Also...Ialthos, are you <em>dressed</em> as a knight or are you <em>actually</em> a knight? Because  I don't think you said what your costume is."</p>

            <p>"I think I remember seeing one of those books somewhere. Can't for the life of me remember where though," Sammy said, still grinning.</p>

<p>"Why would a Ranger be named Halt?" Leonidas mused.  "If a Ranger is expected to wander, then is it simply irony that drove the writer to name one the synonym for an abrupt stop in movement?"</p>

<p>Sammy glanced to Leonidas, slightly surprised. He didn't usually get this much idle conversation out of his partner in a day, let alone in the space of a few minutes.  He took off his goggles and cleaned them with a soft cloth he produced from his pocket, quietly pleased with the Space Marine's sudden sociability.  "So how long have you two been here? And how'd you end up here, anyways? Plothole?"</p>

            <p>Ialthos wrinkled his brow. "Honestly, I'm not sure. We were there, now we're here. I hope they're alright without us."</p>

<p>"Ehh, they'll be fine!" Ferrux clapped a hand over the knight's shoulder. "Eric's got a good head on his shoulders, mostly. And Liz is growing up fine! It's hardly like we're the center of the universe or anything..."</p>

<p>"I guess you're right. Man, Liz was cool... She hit me over the head, once."</p>

<p>"Agreed," Leonidas nodded.   "Unless she communicated only in the Ork tongue."</p>

            <p>Ian and Henry had satisfied themselves with all the sugary goodness on offer for the moment and begun to wander the rest of the party, looking for entertainment. Henry had spotted Leonidas, which wasn't exactly hard.</p>

<p>Ian shook his head. "No way, I'm not going over there. The other one <i>said</i> he'd cut us down. What if this one actually does?"</p>

<p>Henry smirked. "You scared?"</p>

<p>"Yeah! Why aren't you?"</p>

<p>That was not the answer Henry wanted. He scowled, which he could do quite impressively with his long face. "Ian, it's a party, and it's the PPC. We're totally surrounded by people who probably have knives and stuff. Nobody's gonna hurt us. Don't be a baby." He marched toward the legionary.</p>

<p>Ian sighed, shook his head, and followed. Technically, he was older, so it was probably his responsibility to save his friend's life if it came down to it, even if he was being <i>really</i> stupid.</p>

<p>"Hi!" Henry called out once he got close enough. "Who are you guys?"</p>

<p><br>
(( Henry's logic here is unimpeachable. {= P I couldn't resist the urge to try and get him into a conversation here. He has opinions about the original Leonidas and certain portrayals thereof thanks to his association with Agent Suicide. ))</p>

            <p>Sammy waved at the two boys, almost his age but not quite.   "I'm Sammy, Gunpla builder and battler, although right now I'm doing neither.  Your Scout outfits look great." With a wink, he put a fist over his chest in the iconic salute of the Scouts.</p>

<p>"If you're Scouts, shouldn't you be wearing carapace armor?"  Leonidas interjected.  "And are those jump packs of some kind?  Those aren't issued until a Scout progresses to the Assault Squads of the 8th Company..."</p>

<p>Sammy rolled his eyes, but seemed unperturbed by his partner's critique of the newcomers.  "Wrong canon, mate."</p>

<p>"That explains much.  And as I forgot to introduce myself, I am Master Leonidas of the Dark Angels Chapter."</p>

<p>(I really need to read those stories. I've only really read the Original Series, and new missions as they come out. :P Naturally, Leonidas hasn't seen Attack on Titan since it'd be funny to have him mistake the meaning of the term Scout to refer to a newly recruited Space Marine...)</p>

            <p>It took them a moment to rebound from Ferrux's boggling stream of talk.</p>

<p>"Um, the Scout Regiment is from <i>Attack on Titan</i>," Ian said, once more taking up the job of explaining things. "They go outside the city walls, they can almost fly with their omni-directional mobility gear" —he patted his replica, which was primarily made of cardboard— "and they fight Titans." He cut the explanation off there, just in case, unaware of the potentially hilarious ambiguity of the term.</p>

<p>Henry grinned at Ferrux. "Did you say you're a dragon? You should go talk to Thoth. He's being a dragonrider." Switching gears, he turned to address the new Space Marine. "Is Leonidas your real name, or is that your costume? You don't look like the real Leonidas. Or even the bad one."</p>

            <p>"Well," he began with great authority, "Leonidas was the King of Sparta in ancient Greece, and he was the one who led the three hundred Spartan hoplites and their allies in the battle at Thermopylae. He was a great warrior and a great leader. He wouldn't ask his men to do anything he wouldn't do himself. My friend Suicide—he's really my mom's friend, but he's mine, too—he told me the soldiers used to tell this joke: What's the difference between the Spartan king and a mid-ranker?" He paused for suspense and grinned the grin of a boy about to say something he knew full well he shouldn't. "We sleep in this shithole over here. The king sleeps in that shithole over there."</p>

            <p>"And Ireland in-universe.  It's a somewhat obscure canon--not a proper <em>Gundam</em> series really, it's more like <em>Digimon</em> or <em>Beyblade</em> but with models of mobile suits," Sammy said enthusiastically.  "Yeah, it was pretty quiet in my home too.  Not much in the way of kings or warriors--just a big world to explore and good friends to play and battle by your side," he finished wistfully.  He fumbled with a hard leather pouch at his side and pulled out a figure of some kind of war machine, the model about six or so inches tall and painted green and gold, wielding a flail.  "One hundred and forty fourth the size of the real thing," he said.  "Made it myself," he added proudly.  "Gotta see if there's a Gunpla Battle system in HQ.  Haven't looked into it much yet."</p>

<p>"I'm from Warhammer 40,000," Leonidas rumbled when Sammy was finished.  "I was Master of the Fifth Company of the Dark Angels Chapter of Space Marines when I...left.

<p>"Good point," Sammy sighed. "Anyhow, yeah.  <em>Wing</em> is awesome. It's where I started, and even though I've watched a lot of others since then, it's still my favorite and I keep coming back to it.  If you ever wanna meet up and binge-watch it, let me know.  That goes for all of you lot," he added, including the dragon/knight couple as well as the boys in his invitation.  "Or binge-watch anything, really. With some exceptions." He coughed twice suddenly, and it sounded strangely as if the word "<em>Twilight</em>" was sandwiched between the two coughs.</p>

<p>“I’m not sulking! I’m being in character!” Edward was dressed as a zombie, and he was walking like one too: arms stretched out in front, staggering from side to side.</p>

<p>“Don’t be silly! Just because I dragged you to this party doesn’t mean you can act stupid! I don’t know about you, but I’m here to have fun and socialise, not to have an embarrassing brother trailing after me!”</p>

<p>“I’m hardly the most embarrassing person in HQ. Anyway, this is a complete waste of time.”</p>

<p>“Shut up,” said Kat, adjusting her witch’s hat with one free hand. “How do I look?”</p>

<p>“Like my sister.”</p>

<p>Kat rolled her eyes, pushed open the door and stepped through. Edward lurched after her, hissing “Brains...”</p>

            <p>Well, the clatter of heels, and the wordless growl that accompanied it. And the shouts of, "Look out!" and "Get out of the way!" and one shout of, "YOUR BANGS!" That last was probably addressed to the person barreling towards them who probably had no idea where they were, given that they would have had to have x-ray vision to see through their hair. Thus, they were now bearing down on the siblings, and if they didn't move, there was going to be a collision. There would probably be one if they did move anyways, but it would be between the stranger and the wall instead.</p>

            <p>but Edward was too intent on his zombie impression to move until it was too late. His hunched position made him harder to knock over, but the speed of the collision and the weight of the other person sent them both flying in opposite directions.</p>

<p>Kat ran forward and grabbed her hat, which was now rather squashed. She began carefully manipulating the fabric, trying to repair the damage.</p>

<p>Edward stood up very slowly. “That,” he said, “is why I don’t like parties. Now I’m going to get a drink.”</p>

<p>“Edward,” said Kat reproachfully, “you know you shouldn’t drink! Remember the time you flooded the entire room?”</p>

<p>But he was already gone. Kat shrugged, and decided she couldn’t be bothered to chase after him. There was a fun night to be had.</p>

            <p>...said Thoth, adjusting his costume.</p>

<p>Tom shrugged, his grey cloak obscuring his face. "Hey, you can probably blame Derik somehow. I certainly would. Just avoid offering anyone Mjød this time. The residual smell of the vomit hung around for quite some time."</p>

<p>"Very well." said Thoth. "I do not wish to see this costume ruined in any case. It took significant effort to get it in the proper size." The fur-lined jacket he was wearing looked it: while it was cleanly stitched enough, it appeared just a bit <em>ad-hoc</em>. There were more seam lines than might be expected, as was required to fit a Astartes' frame.</p>

<p>"Hey, I had to put in some effort too!" Tom waved the implement in his hand, so as to draw attention to it. "I had to find a <em>distaff</em>! I didn't even know what a distaff <em>was</em> when I started doing this!"</p>

<p>"And I had to research anything about this uniform that the novels did not reference."</p>

<p>Tom squinted at Thoth. "And what possessed you to want to go as a Dragonrider anyways?"</p>

<p>"It's what I've been reading of late. Care for some Klah?" The tone of that response made it clear Thoth wasn't getting any more information.</p>

<p>--</p>

<p>In another corner of the party, two men were engaged in an argument.</p>

<p>"I don't look like him!"</p>

<p>"You absolutely do."</p>

<p>"I don't at all! The build's off, I tell you, not to mention the hair!"</p>

<p>"Then why'd you go as him?"</p>

<p>"<em>Because everyone says I look like him!</em>"</p>

<p>Ialthos grinned. "You're not getting out of this one that easy, dragon."</p>

<p>Ferrux, laughed, his eyes twinking. "Oh, really, then? Well then I guess I can do... <em>this</em>!" He planted a large hand atop Ialthos' head, rubbing it back and forth through his hair.</p>

<p>"Aaaugh! Stop that!" cried the knight. But he was smiling as he said it. "I'm too tall, and not even in the right costume for that to make sense!"</p>

<p>"We could have gone as a pair, you know..."</p>

<p>"Please. You can pull of Iskandar easy, but if you think I could do Il-Melloi II, you're out of your mind."</p>

<p>"And what is your costume, anyways?" asked Ferrux (who, despite what he might claim, could put on a decent show as The King of Conquerers if you didn't look too closely).</p>

<p>Ialthos puffed out his chest in mock pride, pulling his mottled green cloak close around himself. "I," he said, "am the formidable Ranger, Halt."</p>

<p>"...Huh. Why that?"</p>

<p>"You know how everyone says you look like Iskandar?"</p>

<p>"Yeah..."</p>

<p>"Everyone says <em>I'm</em> a discount Ranger."</p>

<p>((Yes, I've brought in two groups this year. Meet Tom and Thoth, once again, and for those of you who haven't yet, meet Ferrux the Dragon (presently in human form) and Sir Ialthos! I trust you'll find them pleasant enough.))</p>

            <p>Two boys dressed as Scouts a la <i>Attack on Titan</i> went barreling through the crowd. Nine-year-old Henry Robinson was taller and skinnier than his ten-year-old friend, Ian Thomas Horowitz, and he used that to his advantage in order to slip between people, even if they were really standing too close together.</p>

<p>"'Scuse me! Pardon me! Coming through!" he called out, grinning. He was Eren Jaeger. He was flying through the air with his ODM gear, swinging through the narrow city streets, ready to whip out his sword and slice into anything that got in his way!</p>

<p>He didn't have a real sword, of course, and he wasn't planning to hit anybody with his pretend one—he would be SO dead if his mom found out—but that wasn't the point. The point was he was free and fast and unstoppable.</p>

<p>Until something, or rather someone, caught his eye and he skidded to a stop. He backed up a few steps and looked up—and up, and up some more—at the giant man in what he was pretty sure was a dragonrider's flight jacket. "Whoa," he said. He looked back the way he'd come, found his friend in the crowd, and called to him. "Ian! Hey, Ian! Come over here!"</p>

<p>Ian caught up, puffing a little with the effort of going around groups Henry had simply gone through. "Dangit, you're too fast," he complained. "What?"</p>

<p>"Do you see this guy?" Henry gestured. He was <i>pretty</i> sure they were far enough away not to be noticed gawking.</p>

<p>"Whoa," Ian echoed. Then he grinned. "Is he a Titan? Do we hafta go for the nape?"</p>

<p><br>
(( I think Ian was technically adopted at some point, but then nothing ever came of it and I don't remember who adopted him, so I'm borrowing him again. If that person turns up and wants to take over, I'm all for it! ))</p>

            <p>Once it was clear they weren't in trouble, though, Henry stepped forward to regard Thoth more closely. "Aren't you a little <i>tall</i> for a dragonrider?" he asked, deliberately emulating Princess Leia's skeptical tone when she'd asked a similar question. Henry had a naturally solemn look and a nose too long for his face, which were the legacy of one of his fathers, and fine, uncontrollable black hair and green eyes, which were reminiscent of the other. He was not a beautiful child.</p>

<p>Ian, on the other hand, was a typically well-built and all-over golden Australian, this being the only concrete detail defined about his heritage. He hung back, unwilling to get quite as close as Henry to the stone-faced giant who had obviously overheard his joke. Rather, he sidled more toward Tom. He looked nice, like Gandalf, only without a beard.</p>

I was tempted to use the Disguise Generator to correct this, but my partner here informed me this would break etiquette. I did not believe that risking my limited abilities in biomancy on such a feat was worthwhile."</p>

<p>"...But excuse my partner," Tom interjected. "He's being terribly rude! I'm actually Tom, and this here's Thoth. Who're you two?"</p>

<p>((...And yeah, you were dead-on.</p>

<p>Ian nodded. "Yeah, okay." To Tom, he explained: "Eren and Levi are Scout Division. They fight Titans. Titans are like giant naked dudes who eat people, and you have to cut the nape of the neck to kill them." He glanced nervously at Thoth and murmured, "But, we weren't really gonna..."</p>

            <p>Ian—despite nodding a quick affirmative to Tom—was clearly ready to bolt, but Henry was entering a phase of more self-confidence than sense. He only wished he could do proper magic already; then he'd show anybody who thought they could hurt his friends. For now, though, he was still only nine, and he could only make things happen by accident sometimes, if he were really mad or scared. He wasn't <i>quite</i> either one yet.</p>

<p>"How do <i>you</i> know my mom?" he said.</p>

<p>"Your mom knows everyone," Ian whispered.</p>

            <p>Tom laughed. "Yeah... like we could keep this guy under wraps. 'e's huge! Just tell him the story, Thoth."</p>

<p>"I met your mother a year ago," said Thoth. "Exactly one year ago, in fact. At a party much like this one. Derik was... inebriated. Such things seem to attract her attention. Later, I provided my assistance in heeling an injury."</p>

<p>"...You forgot the part where you were <em>also</em> somewhat drunk, and called Derik "brother" for about half the evening." Tom said. "Didn't she bless us, too? Or you, at least... I have no idea how you keep charming important people."</p>

<p>Thoth shot him a glare. Tom ignored it, as usual.</p>

<p>Charlotte gently tugged Ix farther into the room with one hand, using the other to keep the skirts of her red gown off the floor. "I'm sure," she said firmly. "Your mask isn't going to fall off this time—you'll be fine." She paused, then reached up to adjust the black bandanna on Ix's head. "Though hold still for a bit. You tied it crooked."</p>

<p>Ix's mouth quirked up in a smile. "As you wish," she said, and offered Charlotte her arm. The pair set off towards the snacks table, Ix feeling significantly more confident about this year's Halloween party than the last.</p>

            <p>It&#39;s usually okay to jump into a thread if something catches your interest. Like, if two characters are having a more intimate moment, you/your characters may wish to exercise common courtesy and leave them alone, but on the other hand, it might be okay to interrupt because of the Narrative Laws of Comedy. If you&#39;re not sure, just ask. More people/characters makes things more complicated, but as long as everyone takes turns and no one is left behind, it&#39;s fine. {= )<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>But on the other hand, that&#39;s sort of what the Reality Room does. Drop a Suvian in there, and everything that doesn&#39;t make sense no longer functions. This may have the side-effect that the subject can no longer survive, which is why it&#39;s been used as an assassination method a couple of times. That works by isolating the Suvian from the Word Worlds so that their ability to manipulate narrative-based reality is denied. I don&#39;t know if there&#39;s a way to make that portable.<br><br>I think the reason a typical exorcism wouldn&#39;t work on a Suvian or character replacement is that, if you&#39;re going to drive out an evil influence, there has to be an influence-ee left behind that&#39;s worth saving. The whole conceit behind Suvians needing to be assassinated is that there&#39;s nothing salvageable about them. Suvians aren&#39;t under an evil influence; they ARE the evil influence. Charge lists exist to determine that this is the case, and that they&#39;re not just a mediocre character that could be improved with a bit of work.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Tiger was extremely confused.  Normally that was a very rare occurrence, but anyone would be confused by the situation Tiger was currently in.<br><br>He was meant to be working together with his sister to fight a Changer, which was a shapeshifting monster which could only be defeated by exploiting its weakness – but the problem was, different Changers had different weaknesses and there was no way to tell which weakness any Changer had.<br><br>This particular one was large and seemed to be made of purplish-black mist which was constantly changing shape. That made it a lot harder to attack in any way, because it would just change to avoid the attack.<br><br>Magic, on the other hand, couldn’t be dodged and most Changers couldn’t block it either, which gave them one weapon – but there was only so much magic they could use and they didn’t know which spells to use.<br><br>Holly shot a Freezing Spell at the Changer, but it had no effect. Tiger, meanwhile, was trying to think of possible weaknesses to attempt to work with. So far, he’d tried wind, fire and water, but none had worked.<br><br>The logical next choice was water, but his magic was running dangerously low and he doubted that Holly would try in any way to save him.<br><br>That was when the Changer decided to attack. It charged directly towards Holly, who quickly raised a magical shield to keep it away. It then turned on Tiger.<br><br>Heart pounding, he tried to summon a shield as Holly had done, but in his nervousness he mispronounced the spell and it didn’t work.<br><br>There was no chance for a second attempt. He tried to run, but it was already too late. As the tendrils of mist began to engulf him, he screamed. To his surprise, the mist retreated a little. <br><br>Surprised, he screamed again and this time the monster moved away from Tiger. Holly, seeing what was going on, screamed too and the eerie sound echoed through the still valley. A few banshee-like howls later, the purple mist melted away.<br><br>“Seriously?” said Tiger. “Its weakness is screaming?”<br></p>

            <p>The season 1 intro because the show introduces itself so beautifully. No more needs to be said.<br><br>The middle of season 3 because I like classical tragedy, and the &quot;Fifth War&quot; arc had it all. Explosions, poison, philosophy getting thrown around everywhere, and of course, piles and piles of corpses. I know some people didn&#39;t like the new main cast, but I really enjoyed seeing things through the eyes of the mooks that seemed so faceless and disposable earlier in the series. It also made the audience reconsider whether the court&#39;s personal drama was really all that important in the midst of a crazy war.</p>

            <p>The Court were a great initial set of characters, but having even less-than-omnipotent &#39;gods&#39; as your protagonists kind of makes proper threats hard to come by.

            <p>I like &#39;Seph just as much as the next guy, but I think the scenes with her were actually Fifth War&#39;s weak point. They would have worked in season two, but she brought too much of that old style to an arc significantly darker and more grounded than the early days. Having her snarking about wine vintages an episode after Private Cuztec&#39;s heroic last stand was a bit jarring for me.<br><br>In short: I disapprove of plot-lines that don&#39;t affect each other.</p>

            <p>I know, I know - me as a &#39;Seph apologist, whatever next, but I feel like the dissonance you&#39;re talking about was the entire point. The fact that the remaining gods were still in &#39;business as usual&#39; mode - still acting as though It Can&#39;t Happen Here - I think it was kind of a WWI allegory? Like how the royal houses of Europe saw the Great War as just another imperial spat, and then suddenly - &quot;my God! Millions of people are dead, however did that happen?&quot;<br><br>Ironically, Persephone is probably the one this applies <i>least</i> to, since she already had her &#39;my Me!&#39; moment after the Hades Assassination. Remember this?<br><br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/81bMg8c.png"><br><br>(Art Deco Greek mythology is my new favourite style, btw.)<br><br>Chills, I&#39;m telling you. So things like the wine episode were a bit backslidey, yes, but I read them more as her being in denial. It&#39;s all about building the tension, so that when the moment comes in S4 when she finally puts on the Helm of Darkness and throws in with Colonel Tezu for good, it actually <i>means</i> something.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>But Cuztec&#39;s last stand was the best scene in the entire show. That&#39;s how you end a character arc. Never before or since was the phrase &quot;I&#39;ll figure something out&quot; so badass or so poignant. This from a guy who was introduced as a permanently helmeted strawman. It kinda feels like the show giving a middle finger to itself.</p>
