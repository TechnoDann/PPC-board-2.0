            <p>Wow.  That badfic sure had a lot of weird little idiosyncrasies to it.  I&#39;m impressed you were able to keep the mission itself so short and readable.  I&#39;ll have to keep that strategy in mind for when I have to deal with a long, complex one.<br><br>Oh, Flowers.  I love their lack of understanding about humanoid emotions.  I&#39;m sure for them, it&#39;s perfectly reasonable to assign work in between a wedding and honeymoon.  They must see all three as tasks to be checked off a to-do list, so why not interject work in between the fun ones, eh?<br><br>I like that you brought up the lack of wand use by African wizards, since that&#39;s traditionally been an automatic charge for PPC agents.  (I assume that&#39;s new info off of Pottermore?)  And I loved Ix&#39;s instantaneous packing to make sure they got away before another mission could show up.<br><br>One possible typo:<br>&quot;Ix caught her hand and placed a gentle kiss <b>to</b> it, smile widening.&quot;<br><br>I&#39;ve usually heard this phrase as &quot;placed a kiss on it&quot; rather than &quot;to it.&quot;<br><br>—doctorlit, familiar with the canons this time</p>

            <p>I imagine Ix and Charlotte will have a bit of a workload when they get back from their fun. :P<br><br>And yeah, the stuff about wandless magic comes off of Pottermore—wands are largely a European invention, and African and Native American wizards still stick to wandless magic. Students from Uagadou like being able to get away with deliberate magic by claiming it was accidental (&quot;I was just pointing at him, I swear I didn&#39;t mean to turn him into a newt!&quot;). I imagine it won&#39;t be easy getting over the idea that you need a wand to perform magic, though, so Ix won&#39;t be lobbing fireballs anytime soon. :P<br><br>I did intend for that to be &#39;to&#39; instead of &#39;on&#39;. The actual mistake was &#39;placed&#39; instead of &#39;pressed&#39;, so I&#39;ll go fix that now. <br><br>Thanks for the review!<br><br></p>

<li>Ix just casually shucking off a wedding dress. I know it&#39;s just brevity of writing, but it doesn&#39;t sound like any wedding dress I ever heard of. ^<em>~<br><br>2. That anyone, anywhere, could look at the TransLatin sentence &quot;Donatus est nobis quod exviet sea mater Magia Tellus&quot; and think &#39;yep, pretty sure that&#39;s got the name &#39;Hecate&#39; in it!&#39;<br><br>3. The scene where they all start doing double-acts: <i>&quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot; Evelina and Luna answered together. As if they had been waiting for one of them to ask that question two elves appeared before them</i> (Maybe the PPC format rubbed off on them?)<br><br>4. Elroy the Elf. Hey, maybe he&#39;s Franco-Sindarin and going for &#39;Royal Elf&#39;?<br><br>5. <i>the leaders of the Elvish Hunt and we have brought you to Valinor before we send you to Middle-Earth</i> What the sacred flying feth?!<br><br>6. That anyone would turn <i>down</i> the chance to honeymoon in Valinor. ^</em>~<br><br>(Side note: the Wizarding Association of Non-Europeans would like to remind you that Wands Are Not Ethical. <a href="https://technodann.github.io/PPC-board-2.0/archive/2016/08c.html#post-168562">Register your support for W.A.N.E. today</a>.)<br><br>7. Neville Longbottom, Action Hero. I know, I know, but... yeah.<br><br>8. This passage: &quot;Aragorn answered after blinking for several seconds as his brain tried to register the question through the fog his mind had descended into after he set eyes on Evelina.&quot; ... which basically says &#39;Aragorn realised what nonsense he was spouting, but the Suvian had him&#39;.<br><br>(Side note: &quot;What’s so wrong with actually writing a developing romance? Some of the best stuff happens at the beginning!&quot; is a lovely line, and I take it to heart.)<br><br>(Side note: Too much time on the paleoblogosphere for me - I was wondering what kind of creature <i>Colloportus</i> is, and why it was helping them out. ^<em>^)<br><br>9. &quot;She squealed when Ix opened a portal and swept her off her feet into a bridal carry.&quot; Ix. You&#39;re going to tear your incisions again. Ix, did you even bother to get that looked at? Ix, my wife is a nurse and she says this is <i>not good wound care</i>, Agent Ix!<br><br>Overall: That was fun. I&#39;m not very good at overall comments. ^</em>^<br><br>But I do have the image of Elroy and Larien as a comic faux-action duo stuck in my head now, swinging down from the trees with dramatic music playing and so forth. All very <i>Robin Hood</i>. :D<br><br>hS</li>

            <p>Let&#39;s get started.<br><br><i>Ix nipped at her lower lip, smiling. “A beach,” she said. “Somewhere isolated, where it’ll be just the two of us…”</i><br>Guess that would be the moment the IO began to ruin their honeymoon.<br><br><i>Ix yelped and fell off the sofa, landing with a whump. She tripped over her skirts as she stood, then hiked them up as she hurried to silence the console. Her face contorted. “We were supposed to get time off, not a mission!”</i><br>The Flowers, once again deomnstrating why every single one of them except Captain Dandelion and its Weeds are waste of... Well, <i>everything</i><br><br><i>“Oh, fun.” Charlotte came to join her at the console, resting a hand on the small of her back. “Guess we’ll be spending our honeymoon in Middle-earth, huh?”</i><br>To be fair, it has beautiful cities and beaches. Far less polluted you.<br><br><i>“Guess we should get changed,” Charlotte finally said, looking down at her own gown. “Unless you want to go Sue-slaying in our wedding dresses.”</i><br>But I&#39;m sure covering this robes with glittery blood would launch a whole new mode. Try it, please?<br><br><i>“You’re not going to comment on the fox ears or the three tails?” Ix asked dryly.</i><br>Signs of burnout, and how much you needed these vacations. And the aroma of carbonized Flowers now.<br><br><i>Three years ago when Evelina had turned sixteen she&#39;d come into her creature inheritance which just so happened to be a Kitsune like her dad. However, unlike her dad she had copper red ears and tail as she had not only gotten her eye colour from her mother but also her hair colour, whereas her dad had black ears and tail to match his hair, though her creature inheritance wasn&#39;t the only thing she&#39;d gotten from her dad as she gotten her wide almond shaped eyes, high cheek bones and a dimple in her right cheek when she smiled. </i><br>Euuuuh, hate bearking it to you, buuuuut–<br><br><i>“Holy wall of description, Batman,” Ix said, wrinkling her nose. “I’m failing to see how this Evelina Sue is supposed to be a female Harry. She doesn’t really resemble him… at all.”<br>Yeah, this. Thanks Ix.<br><br><i>Ix’s ears went pink and she smiled. “You were much more beautiful,” she said, nuzzling Charlotte’s neck. “But then again, you always look beautiful.”</i><br>I think your wife might have a different opinion. Just a random wild crazy shot in the dark.<br><br><i>She wasn&#39;t the only one to have come into a creature inheritance. Luna did too. She was an elf like her mother but because her dad was only a human she&#39;s only half elf whilst the rest of her genetic makeup was half human.</i><br>Uh uh. Sure you don&#39;t want to explain the word unique while you&#39;re at it? I mean, you&#39;re clearly taking the Ready Player One school of &#39;explaining to poor dumb little readers everything&#39;, so run with it all the way.<br><br><i>“Damn, and here I left my creaturefic Bingo cards at home,” Charlotte sighed.</i><br>Wait, you&#39;re telling me I&#39;m messing a BadBingo Card for my collection? Where can I find one?<br><br><i>“Honestly, I can’t really look at fics that involve mates the same way anymore,” she said. “It just…” She wrapped her arms around herself. “Uncomfortable.”</i><br>I recommend shooting the groins of the glitterbags impplied in the mess. Highly therapeuthic.<br><br><i>“Hecate?” Ix sputtered. “Ritual chanting? Hecate? Did this become a Percy Jackson crossover when I wasn’t looking?”</i><br>&quot;Are you [BLEEEP]ing me? Just how inept about the use of mag–&quot;<br>Marina is ecstatic.<br><br><i>Charlotte opened her mouth to answer, but a pure silver light engulfed the Sue, Neville, and Luna—and both agents.<br></i><br>It better not be doing anything &#39;funny&#39; to Ix&#39;s ability to use magic.<br><br><i>[Elroy. Male elf Elf Elf elf elf. Elf. Male elf. Noncanon. Bit character.]</i><br>No mention of borderli– blatant plagiat? That thing is broken.<br><br><i>[Larien (“Mile girl”, “ear girl”, “fat girl”, “flat girl”). Female elf. Noncanon. Bit character.]</i><br>Okay, maybe not.<br><br><i>“At least we know her name could… potentially work?” Ix said faintly. “Though I doubt ‘mile girl’ or ‘fat girl’...”</i><br>Eh, don&#39;t throw away the second one so fast. With all these kings getting nicknamed &#39;The Fat&#39;, no one can really tell...<br><br><i>“I’m sorry, did she just say Valinor?” Charlotte sputtered.</i><br>Joy, that&#39;s Uber-Kewl Land, the nicest but most boring place of Arda, where you can heroically flee and ignore everything happening in Midle Earth. Still might make for a quiet honeymoon location, though.<br><br><i>“Happily ever after,” Ix murmured, kissing her.</i><br>Offering black-hole coffee to everyone having a sugar overload from this adorably cute exchange.<br><br><i>Charlotte sighed and rolled her eyes. “Of course he is,” she muttered. “Because why not?” She held up her remote. “It’s a two month time skip ahead… unless you want to spend our honeymoon in Valinor for two months?”</i><br>Nice but boring, and you&#39;re missing out on most of the places known in the Lord Of The Rings. Not really recommended. (And very begrudgingly giving smallest possible duck to the Suethor for acutally thinking about the language thing. that&#39;s more than many, many do. Only make the rest worst when you can bebothered to make even that small effort though.)<br><br><i>“Oh, one arrow, that will come in handy, I’m sure,” Ix said sarcastically, and Charlotte grinned.</i><br>Pfft, real Archers don&#39;t need any. Only the ability to copy blades of legends and turn them into arrows. Or gunfire.<br><br><i>Ix shrugged. “Wouldn’t be the first time,” she said. “The real question, though—why do they still need their wands if they can do wandless magic? Sentiment? I mean, I’d keep mine, but… probably somewhere safer than my arm.”</i><br>Eh, if they offer a place to blow them up, never complain.<br><br><i>“I mean… it’s not exactly English wizardry, but African wizards never use wands,” she said. “I, er.” Her ears pinked slightly. “I might have picked up some of Uagadou’s course books to look at. It’s quite fascinating.”</i><br>&quot;<i>What?</i> Your magic wasn&#39;t broken enough? That&#39;s–&quot;<br>Marina is very happy for all Potterverse magicians.<br><br><i>Ix held up her hands for Charlotte to see. There, rising up from her palms, so faint as to be almost imperceptible, was a wisp of smoke. “It’s no handful of fire, that’s for sure,” she said in embarrassment. “It’s taken me nearly a month to get this far.”</i><br>&quot;Finally some acknowledgemnt magic is long hard work!&quot;<br>((Smelling some Eau de Chekov here...))<br><br><i>“Screw the mission,” Charlotte said. “It’s interfering with our bloody honeymoon. Which we got approved time off for,” she added sourly.</i><br>Pretty sure you&#39;d prefer screwing your companion.<br><br><i>“This just in,” Charlotte whispered as she and Ix crouched behind a clump of bushes, “Bree is now Mordor.”<br><br>“I’ll say,” Ix said, looking up at the gates with trepidation before glancing around. “Where’s our Sue gotten off to?”</i><br>Probably that weird game with Aragorn as protagonist with a name I can&#39;t remember, where Bree is infested with bandits wanting to kill hobbits... Still better than the adventures of Gerald the Half-Nazgûl in Mordor...<br><br><i>“I can taste the urple,” Ix said as the narration launched into a description of just how handsome Aragorn was. “And… he’s Sue Imprint Number One, isn’t he?”</i><br>I have more black-hole coffee, a shame it&#39;s for therapeuthic use this time.<br><br><i>(She wasn’t wrong, either.)</i><br>Euh, Fourth Wall intervention, or not? Also, you&#39;re married now, with a whole romance leading to it, Ix. Random wild crazy shot in the dark, but I think she finds you beautiful.<br><br><i>&quot;My name is Neville Frank Longbottom, only son of Lord Frank and Lady Alice Longbottom, and this is my sister in all but blood; Evelina Wynter Lillian Potter-Black, only daughter of Lord James and Lady Lily Potter and adopted daughter of Lord Sirius Black who resides in Rohan.&quot; </i><br>Wait, they have Sirius in Rohan? <i>How?</i><br><br><i>“That’s a lot to unpack,” Ix said after a moment of staring. “So… we’ve got something scarily similar to ABO fics with the dominant/submissive mates. Then, you know, mates in general. And did she just get called more powerful than the bloody Maiar?”</i><br>Can&#39;t be outdone by a mere semi-divine being after all... The Sar-plasm is up to anybody wanting it.<br><br><i>“Who else do you want to bet she has picked out for mates?” Charlotte said. “Legolas and Boromir?”</i><br>Naaah, she can&#39;t be that shallow and vapid and everything... What? I wanted to make sure everyone could get their share of Sar-plasm.<br><br><i>“One does not simply walk into Bree,” Ix quipped as they made their way deeper into the village. Once they found the Prancing Pony, they pushed the door open, looking around.</i><br>Well, if you&#39;ve got a siege engine or a spy opening the gates, you can... Oh right, not Divide and Conquer...<br><br><i>“Lottie, you barely remember the Victorian period,” Ix said, threading through the patrons. <br><br>“And I’m very glad for that, too.”</i><br>Pretty surre getting to be old enough to think &#39;good old times&#39; without remembering the bad stuff actually happening back then is cheating...<br><br><i>“Yes, when you kissed her!”</i><br>More points for Direct Approach! Take notes people... And remember to properly build it up first. Or you&#39;re a creep.<br><br><i>“It’s easier if you chop instead of stab,” she said, and Charlotte nodded, readjusting her grip on the hilt.</i><br>But, but, recreating the scene! How could let you base pragmatism ruin that possibility?<br><br><i>Ix tugged the straps a little tighter over her shoulders and smiled. “You did suggest we head off to Pern as soon as we were finished,” she said. She held out a hand.</i><br>Smart thing to do.<br><br><i>“Thanks, Livvy.” Charlotte took Ix’s hand, and Ix tugged her closer. “What do you say, hon? Shall we get out of here?”<br><br>She squealed when Ix opened a portal and swept her off her feet into a bridal carry.<br><br>“Let’s get out of here,” Ix whispered.</i><br>Just avoid the spots where weird threads fall from the sky...<br><br>Please don&#39;t interrupt that honeymoon again, Iximaz. No matter how good the mission will be.<br><br>(Getting the feeling it will be soon time to bid farewell to Three. Shame, I liked her.)</i></p>

            <p>...Well, after the initial hiccup, anyway.

            <p>My thoughts are the same as S.M.F.&#39;s: well balanced between sporking and character fluff, good choice of a bizarre fic that could seriously have been done as original fic without losing anything.<br><br>Also today I learned that creaturefic is a thing. WTF. I mean, the concepts involved aren&#39;t totally new to me, but the fact that it has a name and apparently a set of rules is.<br><br>I was going to comment that there wasn&#39;t a whole lot of scene-setting as far as where the agents were hiding and such, but then I checked again and realized it&#39;s there, just quick and to the point, and I apparently was brain-blind to it. Explains why it didn&#39;t actually bother me, I guess: wasn&#39;t actually a problem!<br><br>I don&#39;t get why Ix and Charlotte both decided &quot;Mile girl!&quot; was especially funny at the same time on the back of wishing there was a translation for &quot;Elroy.&quot; I did appreciate Ix saying &quot;our boy Elroy.&quot; It&#39;s so casual and unforced I didn&#39;t even have to stop and wonder when a wizard girl got exposed to <i>The Jetsons</i>. ^_^<br><br>I also liked the whole bit with the black gates of Bree.<br><br>I hope they get to enjoy Pern now and don&#39;t land in a badfic or something. And best make very certain to pick a time where there&#39;s no imminent Threadfall to worry about!<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I like character-driven pieces. A small, personal conflict that is driven almost entirely by someone being nervous or uncomfortable.

            <p>I do love how the variety of characters in HQ can lead to such simple character-driven events that are nonetheless compelling for being mostly dialogue.  This interlude was a good example of that.<br><br>I liked the Reader&#39;s attempts at poetry, too.  It&#39;s always tricky having a character write something like that, and I like that her poem had a functional rhyme scheme, but was still noticeably bad.  I also liked your description of her art later, too.  You got across what it looked like without, you know.  Actually knowing <i>exactly</i> what Naya&#39;s name in Gallifreyan would look like.<br><br>The ending is what I imagine making plans in HQ must be like, too: all ready to move to the next stage of a project, and the BEEP goes off.<br><br>All in all, you fit a lot of simple goodness into such a short piece.  Well done!<br><br>—doctorlit, fighting to stay awake as he types</p>

            <p>And relational fluff, I guess. <s>Will see for flames later. Grilled corn looks interesting.</s><br><br><br><i>The Reader sighed and, in time honored alien tradition, switched screens to read the Librarian&#39;s latest message. It, at least, was written in familiar (if snippy) Gallifreyan. She skimmed it, already familiar with the contents.<br><br>...In short, I am well. No one is “closing doors in my face” as you have so eloquently put it. My research is proceeding…<br><br>Essentially, the Reader translated to herself, he&#39;s not run into any insurmountable problems in his retirement, or at least not any he wants to discuss with me, and I should stop bothering him about it unless he hints at a real problem. And never mind what happened the last time he did research in Gallifreyan territory, no, because history never repeats itself...</i><br>Sigh... I miss Des, SeaTurtle, July...<br><br><br><i>She sighed and flicked back to the first screen. The sky so bright as dark as night reminds me of the way you might stay for a slight amount of...night? Ugh. Awful. She erased the entire attempt, and sat glaring at the blank screen.</i><br>Yeeeaaah, preferable. Sorry, but no nice words were coming for this one.<br><br><i>How could it be that writing poetry was so difficult? She could speak for hours, couldn&#39;t she? And spot bad writing, and read very quickly, even if her tastes had never really run towards fiction except for those few years...why couldn&#39;t she do this?</i><br>Yeah can be quite hard. I remember my first French teacher in middle school asked us to compose one for a homeschool work all in alexandrines. He was a genuine sadist.<br><br><i>The Reader sighed. “Perhaps you&#39;re right,” she said, although the creature had done nothing but sit on her foot. “I&#39;m no poet. Even my best attempts are rubbish.” She paused, considering. “Perhaps I should attempt to make her a piece of art…”</i><br>Alternative roads are always a thing. And that&#39;s coming from a guy seeing doggedness as a virtue.<br><br><i>Ten hours later, the pov had grown bored and wandered off again. Kozar had come back, had dinner, and gone to sleep; when he awoke and came out of his bedroom to find breakfast, the Reader had barely moved. The main difference was her hair: it had still been in the usual bun before, albeit with wisps beginning to come loose. Now, only a very little bit of the bun remained; most of the Reader&#39;s wavy light brown hair hung loose around her face, fluffier from the way she&#39;d been clutching at it. Some of the ends were still caught in the bun, but that didn&#39;t much help: what was left of it was hopelessly lopsided.</i><br>Funny way to do your hair. Any tips for achieving this look?<br><br><i>“Ah,” said the Klingon. “It&#39;s a courtship ritual. You are finally going to attempt less pathetic flirtation with Naya.”</i><br>Hey, &#39;pathetic flirtation&#39; is a time-honored tradition. It set up the foundation for the &#39;Just Kiss/Choice Verb Already&#39; moment. Also makes the latter more worth it. As long as a direct moment does exist later down the line.<br><br><i>“Her partner does, though,” the Reader said. “He&#39;d see it, and he&#39;d know if it was done poorly.”<br><br>Kozar’s eyebrow went up again. “Isn&#39;t his handwriting so terrible you claim he’s invented Rectangular?”</i><br>Excellent point. He can&#39;t go glasshouse on a gift to your girlfriend with this, you know?<br><br><i>“He would still know,” the Reader insisted. “This needs to be perfect. I can&#39;t give her an inferior gift—and that would be insulting, as though I thought less of her because she&#39;s an alien—no, this must be done as well as though I were giving it to a fellow Time Lord. It has to be—”</i><br>Euuuu–<br><br><i>Kozar refrained from pointing out that neither he nor Naya nor even most of HQ could tell from looking at her work. “Then an imperfection or two is logical. Besides—don&#39;t aliens frequently prize handmade pieces with their small imperfections? Dawn once said it ‘means more.’”</i><br>Well, this for starters. Second, genuine gift to girlfriend. Will she really mind minor faults?<br><br><i>The Reader considered this, tapping her short fingernails against the table. “It still feels like I’m giving her something inferior. And she deserves the best, Kozar.”</i><br>Oh right, Gift To Love Interest. Logic doesn&#39;t apply.<br><br><i>The Klingon sighed. Aliens.</i><br>Resiting urge to comment about glasshouses and culture scorning... well, everything about culture except war.<br><br><i>The Reader blinked again. “I...could do that.”</i><br>Dunno, the &#39;all by yourself&#39; always has its own appeal, like free stuff... No, I don&#39;t tell this to feel better about not being able to wrap up presents properly at twenty four.<br><br><i>Kozar rolled his eyes. “Make your own breakfast, Time Lord.”</i><br>That, and vital considerations like &#39;what is the proper dosage for coffee&#39; can e different for some people. Don&#39;t ask breakfast from heretics using sugar.<br><br><i>He leveled a savage grin at her. “You should try it. Even with the Guardsman&#39;s training, your combat skills are abysmal.”</i><br>Your future poor dodge none withstanding, Xan, he has a point. Sure surprise and sneaky are the supposed ways to go, but you never skip on &#39;stay alive&#39; skills... No matter how many extra lives you have.<br><br><i>The Reader rolled her eyes. “Yes, I believe it will be, for once. Let&#39;s eat and move.”<br><br>Kozar nodded, and picked up his fork. “A good plan.”</i><br>Dunno, it misses both a &#39;fight&#39; step, and the so important &#39;???, Profit!&#39; ones.<br><br><br>Curious to see both the mission and the reaction to the gift... This interlude is just begging for a sequel, please!<br><br></p>

            <p>It feels really nice speaking to you again. Hopes life has been treating you well so far and in the future.<br><br>Speaking of plans, I stumbled on some fantasy webseries where narrative laws are pretty much a divinely enforced thing: Ever considered constantly switching plans? Rules say the first step is always a success, so constantly having a first step going could be the way to go. I mean, if a magical tyrant can base his own rule upon this idea...</p>

            <p>I am a veteran of the Last Great Time War, a conflict that spanned dimensions and the very essence of time itself. I watched timelines been born, age, wither, and die in the blink of an eye, orders and battle plans swallowed up by hyper-entropic decay, and entire platoons gamble their existence based on intel valid in only a fraction of rapidly-shifting timelines.

As I was saying, we&#39;re still having a few <i>minor</i> technical hitches, but our all new Support team <s>who I will be hiring as soon as the last bunch are out of the building</s> are working to bring you the shiniest fanfic website on the internet! Until then, here&#39;s a sneak <sub>oh good grief</sub> preview of our <sub>can&#39;t believe I&#39;m about to do this</sub> hi-tech, <b>3D</b> logo, which will soon be adorning your screen in glorious HD!<br><br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/hAf2tCP.png"><br><br>Ta-da!<br><br>While we&#39;re getting the last few things ready for you <s>and weeping into our artisan coffee</s>, why not flex your fanfic muscles by writing for your favourite fandom - the PPC!

<br><br><b>What is this?</b> This is the thread where we let our inner badfic writers have free rein. All PPC stories are technically fanfics of the Original Series - but they&#39;re all goodfics.

Go nuts!<br><br><b>Who can I write about?</b> Any agents currently in the PPC are open for you to mutilate. There&#39;s a Creativity Shield around ffW, so everything here is emphatically uncanon. Try to avoid using abandoned agents whose creators have left, and if someone asks in this thread that their agents not be used, please respect that.<br><br><b>Where do I post?</b> In this thread, please. With ffW down for the forseeable future, I&#39;m afraid there is unlikely to be an archive this year.<br><br><b>What name should I post under?</b> You should come up with the badficauthorest name you can, of course! <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=310833;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">Take a look at some of our previous examples.</a><br><br><b>What sort of story should I write?</b> A bad one!

Illegible ultra-typo stories are a bit boring after the first one, y&#39;know?<br><br><b>Can I leave reviews?</b> Emphatically yes - that&#39;s half the fun of the game! But do remember to leave them in character - and equally, remember that the flames you receive are not real flames. They&#39;re a game. Don&#39;t get upset.<br><br><b>Do I need a beta?</b> Hahahahahahahaha. Don&#39;t be ridiculous. ^-^ What sort of badfic writer has a beta?<br><br><b>Do I need Permission?</b> Again, what sort of badfic writer asks permission?

I&#39;m sixteen years old and this is the story of my life.<br><br>I was born a normal human girl who loved to read and watch TV, and I wasn&#39;t anything special until one day my life was turned upside-down when I was sucked into the world of Maximum Ride. They experimented on me and gave me bluejay wings and my eyes turned amethyst and my hair snow white. I also discovered I had the powers of fast flight (150 mph or 250 in a dive), gills when I&#39;m underwater, and postcognition (basically she touches anything and can get the history of what happened around it). I can also teleport and soon discovered I could use that to teleport into different universes.<br><br>This time though, while trying to make my way into Adventure Time, I ended up in someplace entirely different: The Protectors of the Plot Continuum!<br><br>Teleporting always left me feeling kind of woozy so I didn&#39;t see right away who was helping me up. <br><br>&quot;Are you okay?&quot; a gentle voice asked, his arms going under mine to help me sit up.<br><br>&quot;I&#39;m fine,&quot; I said touching my head. &quot;I just need to lie down a bit.&quot; And I fainted.<br><br>Supernumerary stared down at the woman in his arms. She was breathtakingly beautiful, with transluscent skin and silvery blonde hair that shimmered with her every movement. He hesitantly brushed her hair out of her face. Though her eyes were closed now, he&#39;d seen them before, a striking amethyst color in all shades of purple.<br><br>He carefully picked her up to take her back to his response center. Maybe after she&#39;d slept it off, she would be able to tell him and Ilraen who she was.<br><br><b>There you have it, my lovelies! Review to see the next chapter!!</b></p>

            <p>I said I&#39;d be doing a folklore project, so here it is! Thanks to others for the inspiration for this one, I think the folk tale is beautiful, and I&#39;m happy to present my own version.<br><br>--<br><br>“Now…” said Suicide, his voice loud and clear so that that everyone could hear. “Do you take me as your lawfully wedded husband?” <br><br>Nume shifted awkwardly in his shabby suit and tie, his throat dry. He’d never been comfortable with crowds, and here he was, about to say his vows before the largest crowd he’d ever seen in all of the PPC. And in clothing that, while the best he could find, was hardly suited for the task. He grabbed his courage and found his voice. “I… I do.”<br><br>“Do you give me your absolute obedience, for as long as you may live, and as long as you may be my husband?”<br><br>“I… do.”<br><br>“Very well. Then prove it.”<br><br>Nume looked at Suicide curiously. This hadn’t been part of the plan. “Huh?”<br><br>A cruel smile played across the Scythian’s face, as his voice dropped to a menacing growl. “Strip.”<br><br>“Wh-what?!”<br><br>“Oh, you heard me perfectly well the first time… Prove to me that you’ll make an obedient husband. Strip. Show our guests what will be mine. Unless, of course, you weren’t faithful in your oaths.”<br><br>Nume felt himself blushing, but he was powerless. What could he do? It surely wasn’t his place to disobey a command from his husband, and he could never bring himself to break his oaths.<br><br>Slowly but surely, he began to pull away his shirt and pants, growing steadily redder as he did so. He knew all of his friends were watching: already he saw, out of the corner of his eye, Ilraen’s curious stare, and knew that Jenni and the rest were watching just as eagerly. He wondered what they thought. Were they in awe of them? Did they look down at him? Perhaps they were laughing, or gazing upon his physique with lust.<br><br>Su’s voice cut through his thoughts. “I said strip. That means all of your clothing.”<br><br>“Yes! Yes,” said Nume hurriedly. Hesitantly, praying that Suicide would stop, he pulled down his underwear. He wondered which would win: the shame of being before the crowd, or the stare of the husky Greek before him. He couldn’t decide which would be more shameful.<br><br>And like that, there he stood, naked for all the PPC to see. He heard chuckles, saw blushing faces. He knew that some felt shame for him. Perhaps, some wanted him for themselves.<br><br>Suicide kicked away his freshly removed clothed. “And now for something that more properly fits you.” With that, he pulled out a white silk wedding dress, elegant, and far beyond anything Nume had ever seen in his life. He reached out tenderly to touch it. “Go ahead, my husband. Put it on.”<br><br>He donned it, his face still reddening at being forced to wear the clothes of a woman, comfortable though they were. He tried his best not to stare out over the crowd, not to see Jenni’s awkward blush, Ilraen’s furrowed brow, Gall and Derik’s matched cocky grins, and the countless other expressions of so many agents.<br><br>“Ladies and gentlemen,” said Suicide, his voice firm. “I now pronounce this man, Agent Supernumerary, as my lawfully wedded husband.”<br><br>--<br><br>((So, this is based, only somewhat loosely, on the story of Griselda (the first part of the story, at least). Which is a real, and very messed up, European folktale. Ix pointed out that the entire story fit SMDS to a T... so here we are. I&#39;ll adapt the rest of the story if I have time.))</p>

            <p>Peregrin was dozing off in the warmth of the Courtyard under a summer-like &quot;sun&quot;, at least until a large dragon-shaped shadow passed over his head. Said shadow was, in fact, cast by a dragon, whose shimmering bulk was about to pass over Peregrin.<br><br>&quot;Ori!&quot; Peregrin shouted. &quot;Do you have a moment?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I might, depending on what you want it for.&quot; she replied, gliding lower.<br><br>&quot;I was hoping you would have time to assist me with certain experiments.&quot;<br><br>Ori dived down, coming in for a landing near Peregrin, who was sitting up. &quot;I take it you are referring your quest to, ah, explore, every type of life in the multiverse.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yes.&quot; Peregrin replied. &quot;Have you reconsidered my earlier request? I have, after all, never been with a Gaemmara, and I believe it would be a very enlightening experience.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I still do not see how we would accomplish that, given our rather different proportions.&quot; Ori said, waving a wing for emphasis.<br><br>&quot;I have been considering this.&quot; Peregrin said. &quot;You have the power to shapeshift, and, from what you have told me, it can be applied to others. Could you, perhaps, increase my size - or simply increase the size of the relevant body part - so that we could both have a satisfying carnal experience.&quot;<br><br>&quot;&#39;Carnal&#39;, now there&#39;s a word I have not heard in quite some time.&quot; Ori said, laughing. &quot;Can you even do that sort of thing at your age?&quot;<br><br>&quot;We Thousanders have techniques,&quot; Peregrin said, &quot;that extend our sexual viability specifically to resolve this problem. After all, it would not be much of an extended life if we could not enjoy ourselves.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Ah.&quot; Ori replied with a low purr. &quot;Then I suppose I could use some ... more intelligent company. Luxury is a rather poor conversationalist, despite her extensive skills.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Luxury, Luxury, ... she wrote the rather comprehensive reference text, yes?&quot;<br><br>Ori nodded.<br><br>&quot;Now, before we engage in our practical experiments, would the enlargement process be reversible?&quot; Peregrin asked. &quot;I would rather not specialize in dragon-sized partners just yet.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Of course. There are canonically absolutely no side-effects to Viviomancy.&quot;<br><br>&quot;So ...&quot; Peregrin asked, &quot;how do you want to go about this?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I think the easiest way would be to make you approximately my size. Then we could,&quot; she licked her snout, &quot;... enjoy each other.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I agree.&quot; Peregrin said. &quot;Especially as this plan relies on magic, which means the square-cube law can be ignored for narrative convenience.&quot;<br><br>&quot;It is also fortunate that Gaemmara have mammal-like anatomy in that respect for no clear reason.&quot; Ori added.<br><br>&quot;Yes, yes.&quot; Peregrin said.<br><br>&quot;Now, I think it would be best for us to begin without delay lest someone enter the Courtyard at an inopportune moment.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Of course.&quot; Ori said, rolling on to her side. &quot;May I enlarge you?&quot;<br><br>Peregrin moved his things off into the distance where they wouldn&#39;t get in the way. These things included his robe, since he didn&#39;t want to damage it during all this, especially since he wouldn&#39;t be needing it. He laid down near, but not too close to, Ori. &quot;I am ready.&quot;<br><br>Ori said a few words in pseudo-Latin, and Peregrin suddenly became a whole lot bigger. Since he&#39;d cleared the area beforehand, this didn&#39;t cause any damage, and he was far enough from Ori that he didn&#39;t run in to her. He slowly lifted an arm. &quot;This will take some getting used to.&quot; he remarked.<br><br>&quot;It does, yes.&quot; Ori said. &quot;Take some time to adjust, and then we can explore your new form <em>thoroughly</em>.&quot;<br><br>Peregrin spent a few minutes moving various body parts around and turning around the grass. Then, he said, &quot;I think I am ready.&quot;<br><br>&quot;<em>Good</em>.&quot; She scooted over to Peregrin and embraced him. The pair of complete nerds then cuddled, kissed, cuddled some more, and eventually had a <em>very</em> good time, the details of which are being glossed over because the author doesn&#39;t feel like writing that sort of thing.<br><br>&quot;Peregrin, that was wonderful&quot; Ori said, yawning, after the main part of the experiment had concluded.<br><br>&quot;It absolutely was.&quot; Peregrin said. &quot;My thanks, Ori.&quot;<br><br>&quot;We should do this more often.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yes. More data will be helpful. Especially with such an intelligent and exciting partner to collect it from.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Oh, you.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Was my assessment of you incorrect?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Not at all.&quot; Ori said. &quot;But it was nice to hear it.&quot;<br><br>&quot;You are welcome, then.&quot; Peregrin replied. &quot;Now, as wondrous as this all was, I would like to be my usual size again.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Very well.&quot; A bit more pseudo-Latin followed, and Peregrin was back to normal, though, as expected, minus clothes.<br><br>&quot;Maybe next time I should shrink down.&quot; Ori said after the change went through. &quot;I have never been human-sized in this form, and it could be an intriguing perspective.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Hm, yes, that could be, though it might fundamentally be the same coupling as we just had.&quot;<br><br>&quot;True. Maybe I could go human. It has been much too long since I have used that form for those purposes.&quot;<br><br>&quot;We could see if your usual shape affects how you operate!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Good idea!&quot; Ori exclaimed. &quot;Not today, though. Maybe next week?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Time is inconsistent enough here that &#39;next week&#39; is almost meaningless.&quot; Peregrin said. &quot;How about the next time we meet here?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Sure.&quot; Ori said. &quot;It&#39;s a date.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Well, no, maybe, somewhat, I suppose it could be, yes.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Great. See you then!&quot; With a running leap Ori took off and soared into the far reaches of the Courtyard, while Peregrin yawned and dozed off on the grass. It was, after all, a warm, &quot;sunny&quot; day in the Courtyard, and he might as well take advantage of it.<br><br>(( Hi everyone. Meet badfic!shipverse!Peregrin and someone vaguely resembling Assistant Librarian Ori. ))</p>

However, I can write about more than that! <br><br>--<br><br>Dafydd turned to Constance. &quot;I love you,&quot; he said.<br><br>&quot;And I love you,&quot; said Constance dreamily. Dafydd&#39;s omega scent kept her perpetually happy and dreamy all day. It was one of the advantages of marrying an elf. Thankfully, her masculine features made the pairing possible.<br><br>&quot;Have you heard from John?&quot; asked Dafydd. Their son didn&#39;t often come home, being busy on missions.<br><br>&quot;What about him?&quot; Constance asked. &quot;Is he a gay man now or something?&quot;<br><br>&quot;No! No!&quot; said Dafydd. &quot;He&#39;s just found his first mate. They&#39;ve already soulbonded.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Mmmm...&quot; said Constance. &quot;That&#39;s good. John&#39;s a good son. I hope he gives me grandkids soon...&quot;<br><br>&quot;That would be nice,&quot; said Dafydd. &quot;Maybe one of them will get the recessive elf gene, and then there will truly be an heir to me...&quot;<br><br>&quot;We can hope, darling...&quot; said Constance, kissing him softly. &quot;We can hope.&quot;</p>

            <p>I was thinking about what SMDS normally writes, and I realized that &quot;ABO&quot; brings up some thorny issues of predestination. If some men are born &quot;alphas&quot; and some are born &quot;omegas&quot; (I don&#39;t know where the &quot;betas&quot; are), doesn&#39;t that assume men must carry out the &quot;sexual role&quot; forced upon them by cruel fate, with no possibility of change?<br><br><br>Glory to Dorn, salutations to all present:<br>LordHammerfell, master of his own destiny, would-be conqueror, &quot;violent, sexual animal&quot;</p>

            <p>It&#39;s not that men are forced to assume any role: They will simply naturally gravitate to their role.

            <p>Leaving aside the inclusion of your usual nonsense with no real justification, is there a reason you opted not to use any of Dafydd and Constance&#39;s actual children for this?

            <p>Wats up every1 its XXEPICJAKEdaTNThogEXEXX an im a kewl sonic minecraft youtuber. if u want 2 check my chanel out u can its da same as my bored user name but thats not the point of my post. teh point is, 2day im goin 2 tell u about the WORST day of my lief. that day was the day i played: da PPC VIDEO GAEM!!!! i had a giltched copy an it sacred the crap outta me!! now i kno wat ur thinkin. im not a coward. im not a scaredy cat. i play minecraft at 3am, i summon hero brine an all evil entites (enty 101 thru 909 look em up or u wont be prepared when they come try 2 kill u) an ive played sonic exe an all teh sonic crepypast games an all that. but the glitches i faced while playing the PPC game was scary on a whole new level. lemme tell u what i mean.<br><br>1 day i was on da discord an a user i hadnt seen before pmed me with a link. his username was n-ever forgot-n and abov da link he sayed 2 me “u may hav joind. u may have permision. but u arent a full ppc memeber yet. u must face baspatism by FIRE.” i replyd 2 him askin him “wat do u mean by dat” but he suddenly disapeard from the lists of users he wasnt even listed as offlien. so i clickd da link an it told me 2 download somethin. teh file was called “PPC Video Game.exe”. i thought 2 myself i liek sonic exe games but i havnt yet playd any w/ other storys b/c those 1s arnt usally all that gud when theyr scratch prpjectz theyr usualy abot a scratchers ocs an not an actul cannon so i dont under stand them an i think theyre boring. no 1 cares abot ur badly recolord sonic cannons an ur animu hair stick men u peace of poop. (i h8 recolorz) but if its ppc an if huniewsmoron mad it then may b its beter dan al da stoopid sonic exe remixs wit ocs on scratch. so i clicked on da file an downloded it 2 my computerator! Aw yeah! i closd discord an waited for it to finish downlodding really exited to begin.<br><br>wen i opend da ppc gaem, on teh tttle screen it sad “PPC da VIDEO GAEM - SATAN EDITION” an it had a hug red pentangram drawed in BLOOD. on da face of a caractr was a big red pentagram an there eyes wer gon an drippin with blood. i was relly scared an kinda ecited bcause it lookd liek a reel horr gam an not jus some poop from a scratcher who dun know what he doin.<br><br>so wen i hit plae i starttd off w/ my caractr in his rc. it lokd normla. i had a postr w/ a pic of sonic. m bed was mesy. i had a rug paternd liek a tnt block. it ... it lokd liek it was mad 4 me. i relized how crepy tha twas, knowin how huenesron is nothin lik me an woldnt includ any of dis in his gaem. i also noticd dat m partners bed was enpty an everthin on thdat sdie of da room loke like i t hand’t ben touched for a whiel. dat was crepy. did m partener die? did satn kil him? ther was nothin 2 interat wit/ in da rom so i went oud ta dor. i walkd arond hq. everhtni as drak. but no npcs were anywere until iig found a rom dat was ful of corpss. som of dem wer hman or hunmnoid corses an som wer sueven corpsen. tah twasnt good. der was a big red pfentangram on the flor. den dre was reds tatic aneed a mesag flashne done htde scrheeen. it sad “dis igs hwo its spowesed 2 be. now mak dat a realty.” den evrrythin disaperd. i was bak in mah rc aggin. “aw is this gona repet until id os umgething?” i sad. aprantlh nto. becaye s wen i exitd de rc agin i saw ppl rushin abot.<br><br>“so… am is uposted 2 kil dem al?” i wondrd 2 myslef. “am i workin 4 satan?

Finaly!<br><br>hunesrons mesage sad:<br>“He tryd 2 imperson8 u an wen i chalenjd him 4 not soundin liek u he got mad an band u. i lokd in2 ur problem. alot of ppl hav had ur problem b4, it seme satan has mad many atempts 2 do bad things thru vide games. u cant delete da gaem if satans corupted it. u cant even click on it or hell come back. wat u ned 2 do is downlod da reel verson of da gaem. abov is a cod w/ u must tyep in2 da game 2 maek it fuse w/ its corupted verson. cant copy an paste it, go leter by leter. only typ in da cod wen u hav maed ur agent as porful as posble, an then u can defet teh su u mad an even satan in da gaem an make him go away. thx for rechin out. - hS”<br><br>now i knew wat i had 2 do. i did al da tings an defeted satan. now he knos not 2 mes w/ me anymoar. but he cold come 4 u. listen, if a discord user u havent seen b4 trys 2 giv u a copy of da ppc gaem, don’t downlod it. u mite not be as luky as me.</p>

            <p>Listen SMDS, you wanna roll with the big boy over on 40k street, you gotta learn how Space Marines work. First of all, they are not &quot;alpha.&quot; Each space marine was designed to take orders without question, and serve with totall loyalty. Even a hertic astartes is still just the peaon of a bigger, nastier Chaos Champion, so unless Thoth has gotten a promotion while I wasn&#39;t looking, he and Derick are in the same boat.

            <p>Ordinarily, this may be the case. But what I don&#39;t think you understand is that being in a relationship fundamentally changes the dynamic. Once two men enter a relationship, that relationship will be unstable until one of them asserts dominance over the other. In this case, it was Thoth over Derik. Although I suppose it could have been the other way, if Derik were less meek and emotional... ^_^</p>

            <p>Wait, sorry, I&#39;ll rephrase that as a statement for you:<br><br>I do not entirely agree with what you&#39;re saying.<br><br>While it&#39;s true that Space Marines were created and conditioned to serve, they were also left with the greater part of the personality traits that made them individuals. The Emperor and his gene-wrights were clever enough to remember that, genetically and socially, diversification means survival. See, if they just wanted a bunch of guys who were all basically the same and were only good at following orders, taking a beating, and little else, they could&#39;ve just bred or cloned them like the <i>migou</i> laborers on Terra. But they didn&#39;t. They took tough kiddos with different skill sets and wrought them into super-tough kiddos with unfaltering(ish) loyalty <i>and</i> different skill sets. Sure, you need plenty of common soldiers to fill the ranks, but even a common Astartes soldier shouldn&#39;t have to go whining to his superior officer for permission to wipe his arse, now, should he? Because out there in the big bad galaxy, beset by xenos and heretics and whatnot on all sides, thinking outside the box and adapting to constantly changing circumstances isn&#39;t just useful; it&#39;s <i>vital</i>.<br><br>TL;DR: Space Marines may not all be leaders, but they sure as heck ain&#39;t all followers, either.<br><br>Anyway, Agent Thoth has the rules and mores of HQ to keep his head on straight. That counts!<br><br>--Lemony</p>

            <p>I meant that astartes are hierarchical. A marine is not truly at home (I know about metaphors) without a rigid command structure, even if he is at the top of it. Thoth could not &quot;assume a position of dominance&quot; over Derick because they are the same rank. Even if a marine doesn&#39;t need &quot;permission to wipe his arse&quot; (I&#39;ll never be able to get rid of that image), he couldn&#39;t just start giving commands to his equals.</p>

            <p>On the other hand--and I know I may seem to be agreeing with DimBulbDeadGlow for a minute here, but bear with me--being technically equal in rank doesn&#39;t necessarily mean being equal in power/authority. The power dynamics of a relationship (any sort) between an Astartes and a human would seem to be weighted toward the Astartes in most cases, wouldn&#39;t they?<br><br>I mean, Thoth is way older than Derik, in all ways more powerful, and until recently used to thinking of himself as superior to all mortals.<br><br>BUT, Derik was a Weyrleader, or at least he remembers being one.

            <p>Faolan Marrok Randel Lycanis of House Lycanis, first of his name, the Untamed, Prince of the Forest and Werewolves, Lord of the Preylands, and Master of All He Surveyed, was having a bad day.<br><br>His sixteenth birthday was fast approaching—the time when he would be expected to take a mate. There were plenty of noble Beta girls that he had his pick from to be sure, but none of them excited him. <br><br>No, what he really needed was an Omega, but such creatures were rare and highly prized, for good reason. The pups born by an Omega were larger, stronger, and much more fit to rule as heirs.<br><br>Of course, nobody had found an Omega for centuries. <br><br>Faolan sighed and pulled on his fur cloak, trimmed with gold. He would take a walk, maybe go to the human village to clear his head. His parents would drive him mad with all the planning and festivities surrounding his birthday.<br><br>The heir to the throne, come of age at last.<br><br>Besides, there was a strange pull drawing him to the village, which he was finding difficult to ignore.<br><br>Faolan didn&#39;t expect today to be any different from all the other times he&#39;d visited the human village, but when he arrived, he realized the village was decorated with streamers and garlands of honeysuckle flowers. He grabbed a passerby to ask what was going on.<br><br>The boy noted the fur cloak and the wolfish cast to Faolan&#39;s face, and bowed his head in reverence. The werewolves were the rules of men, for they were faster, stronger, and longer-lived, and in return for their benevolent rule, the humans would pay tribute every month. The village where they were now frequently sent tribute to Faolan&#39;s hold.<br><br>&quot;Passing through, are you, sir?&quot; the boy said. &quot;His Lordship&#39;s son, Charlus Webb, is turning sixteen today. We&#39;re having a festival to celebrate.&quot;<br><br>How funny a coincidence might that have been! Faolan smiled graciously and inclined his head in thanks. Perhaps he would pay this Charlus a visit.<br><br>Faolan went to the house and was ushered in. It was nice enough, for a human dwelling, though it couldn&#39;t compare to the grandeur of his own holdings. At least the humans here remembered their place.<br><br>He didn&#39;t have to wait long for Charlus to come greet him. The boy was pale, with handsome, sharp features and thick raven hair that fell ever so nicely over his eyes. The draw was stronger now, and Faolan realized the irresistible magnetic pull was coming from <i>him</i>.<br><br>Normally, it was considered improper to shake hands with a human, but he had to see... just this once.<br><br>Their hands met, and a brilliant golden glow surrounded them, a wind stirring around them. Prince Faolan and Lord Charlus felt flashes of white fire in their chests as the soulbond settled. They stared at each other.<br><br>&quot;Hello,&quot; Charlus said breathlessly.<br><br>&quot;Hello,&quot; Faolan said back, equally lost for breath.<br><br>&quot;What is the meaning of this?&quot; Charlus&#39; father sputtered. &quot;What happened? What did you do to my son, werewolf?&quot;<br><br>Prince Faolan drew himself up to his full height, towering over the other man. &quot;You will come back to our hold,&quot; he said, wrapping an arm protectively around Charlus&#39; waist. &quot;Where I will introduce <i>my mate</i> to my parents.&quot;<br><br><br><b>A/N: Yay! Okay, here it is—my first attempt at a soulmates fic! Be nice and leave nice reviews, and I&#39;ll give you lots of cookies! <br><br>What will happen next?

            <p>Charlus pressed against Faolan&#39;s side when his father began shouting. &quot;Absolutely not!&quot; he said. &quot;We let you werewolfs have your tributes but you are not taking my son!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Keep your tributes,&quot; Faolan said dismissively. &quot;Your son is the greatest gift you could give me. He is an Omega, and he shall bear my children, who will inherit the throne after I am dead.&quot;<br><br>Charlus&#39; father&#39;s eyes bugged out. &quot;An Omega?!&quot;<br><br>&quot;A very rare and prized type of male. Now that he and I are bonded, we—&quot;<br><br>&quot;Get out!&quot; his father yelled, pointing. &quot;I won&#39;t have that sort of disgusting filth in my house! Out!&quot;<br><br>Charlus whimpered as Faolan drew him closer. &quot;You will rue the day you cast my mate out of your home,&quot; he declared, his eyes flashing. &quot;Come, Charlus—you have anew home with me.&quot;<br><br>Charlus looked up at him with large, beautiful blue eyes. He looked so frightened and uncertain, and Faolan had a violent urge to protect him at all costs. <br><br>&quot;I will take you back to my castle,&quot; Faolan declared, leading Charlus from the house. &quot;Can you ride?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I <i>am</i> a Lord&#39;s son,&quot; Charlus said, drawing himself up. He was still quite short despite being fully grown. If it weren&#39;t for his scent—now reeking of mating heat—he&#39;d wonder if this boy was supposed to be his mate after all. He was so small, so delicate, and Faolan&#39;s duty as an Alpha was to protect his mate at all costs.<br><br>&quot;Then ride on me,&quot; Faolan said, and shifted into wolf form. He was a magnificent, enormous jet black beast, with fur the same glossy raven shade as Charlus&#39; hair. The eyes still looked like his human form, though, jade green with a golden ring around the pupil. Charlus gaped at him before moving forward, hesitantly running his fingers through the shaggy fur. Faolan grinned a wolfish grin and crouched so Charlus could mount him.<br><br>And that would be the only time Charlus would ever be allowed to &#39;mount&#39; him, he thought as Charlus climbed onto his back. Faolan waited until he was situated, and then took off, running much faster than any horse ever could.<br><br>Charlus yelled with delight at the wind catching his hair, whipping it around his face. They raced through the forest, Alpha and Omega, wolf and rider speeding toward the castle on the mountain in the distance.</p>

            <p>Again, let&#39;s be clear: This is not a PPC fanfic. It has nothing whatsoever to do with Agents Ix Saibhir and Charlotte Webb. This is a good thing, because if you were actually trying to portray those characters, <i>haha</i>, I can&#39;t even type it with a straight face. Just change the names again and what you&#39;ve got here is a perfectly serviceable original fic.<br><br>And as such? Accepting that this is a different world with a different set of rules and social mores? You&#39;re doing some smart things, such as setting up some sort of prejudice against Omegas that works to justify &quot;Faolan&#39;s&quot; protectiveness of Charlus. It also helps that Faolan is royalty, which makes the whole arrogant and domineering Alpha thing easier to swallow.<br><br>One thing I will knock you for, though: The ability to ride a horse, presumably with a saddle and bridle, does not translate to the ability to ride a giant wolf unaided. A wolf&#39;s gait is not the same as a horse&#39;s. Go look up some videos of horses running and some videos of wolves running and see if you can spot the difference.<br><br>--Lemony<br><br>(( For real though, I do think this works pretty well so far. Can&#39;t hate it on the basis of wrecking the characters if it&#39;s not even making a token effort to get them right, and can&#39;t hate it for wrecking humans if one of &#39;em ain&#39;t and the other is accustomed to different rules than we are. Either making something that works was the intent, in which case kudos, or you&#39;re setting us up for a gutpunch of awfulness later, in which case... well, it&#39;s the Badfic Game, so also kudos. {; P<br><br>~Neshomeh ))</p>

            <p>...Miss Sourmilk has everything wrong. This is a good fic, yes: it continues to establish Faolan&#39;s inherent superiority that will come to form the core of their relationship.

Those that cannot become natural omegas, seeking the protection of their peers by becoming adopting a &quot;female-substitute&quot; role for the other men, with none of the dignity that implies.

            <p>ABO, is, of course, a brilliant framework for understanding male-male interactions. This fic also starts off well by establishing Faolan&#39;s obvious superiority as the more masculine, dominant man. This is a fantastic example of how fics should be written, and I am eager to see Faolan take physical dominance over Charlus soon.</p>

The arrivals nod respectfully to them as they pass, and assume their own seats in the ring.<br><br>Huinesoron speaks first. He sits, tall and grim, perched on the edge of his seat, his long hair laser-straight in the still air. &quot;The Action Departments have proven troublesome,&quot; he says in his perfect British accent. &quot;The Aviator continues to be difficult to control, and with the Sunflower still under Agent Thornbyrd&#39;s influence, I have had little luck with him.&quot;<br><br>&quot;We could have her transferred.&quot; Neshomeh Soul adjusts her glasses with one long-fingered hand, peering over them like the archivist she is. Her fuzzy sweater stands at odds with her haughty expression. &quot;The Administrative Departments are firmly under my thumb; the Marquis would do whatever I asked.&quot;<br><br>Huinesoron purses his lips, but shakes his head regretfully. &quot;I&#39;m afraid she would simply refuse,&quot; he says. &quot;We don&#39;t want another Swan&#39;s Egg incident, do we?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Certainly not.&quot; Juliette has one leg draped over the arm of her chair; she fiddles with a mechanical gizmo while she speaks, stopping only to push her electric blue hair back from her face; despite this, she is perfectly focussed on the discussion. &quot;The Infrastructure Departments under my control had enough trouble cleaning up after the last one.&quot;<br><br>Neshomeh coughs pointedly. &quot;I think you&#39;ll find most of the work was done by the DIA,&quot; she says, &quot;which as a security department,&quot; she carefully enunciates the description in lowercase, &quot;falls in my Admin domain.&quot;<br><br>Juliette smiles thinly. &quot;When the Tiger Lily listens to you over me,&quot; she says, &quot;I may accept your allegation.&quot;<br><br>Neshomeh sits up, scowling, but Huinesoron raises his hands for silence. &quot;I will find a way to deal with the Aviator,&quot; he says. &quot;Perhaps we can send her to another mission liable to get her pregnant.&quot;<br><br>Kneeling on her throne, the hobbit Kaitlyn Jackson nods emphatically, setting her long wavy hair bouncing. &quot;Or she could get married,&quot; she suggests. &quot;It worked with the vampire and the werewolf.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Indeed.&quot; Huinesoron favours her with a smile. &quot;Sourcing that love potion to bring them together was an excellent idea.&quot;<br><br>Kaitlyn shrugs, and tugs her waistcoat back into place. &quot;The advantage of dealing with the Ancillary Organisations,&quot; she says: &quot;They&#39;re excellent at thinking outside the box.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Provided they don&#39;t get too uppity,&quot; Neshomeh points out. &quot;The League of Mary Sue Factories, for example.&quot;<br><br>Kaitlyn fixes her with a hard stare. &quot;And whose domain did the Mysterious Somebody fall under?&quot; she asks. &quot;I&#39;m positive it wasn&#39;t <b>mine</b>.&quot;<br><br>This time it is Juliette who raises her hands. &quot;There&#39;s no point arguing over the past,&quot; she says, and the others settle down, for the past is a touchy subject for Juliette. &quot;We are here to determine the future of the PPC, at least for the next year.&quot;<br><br>&quot;And so we shall,&quot; Neshomeh says. &quot;Shall we officially start the meeting?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Always the archivist,&quot; Huinesoron murmurs. &quot;Very well, then: I hereby call this meeting of the Society for the Procuration of Ultimate Dominion to order...&quot;<br><br>-=-<br><br>Authors&#39; Note: The PPC was created by Jay and Acacia. Since their abandonment, however, it rightfully <b>belongs</b> to the Oldbies, who we hope will take this hint and exert their proper authority both in-universe and out.</p>

            <p>Thoth looked at the Words with alarm.<br><br>“What the?” he wondered out loud. “How long has this been going on?”<br><br>“How long has what been going on?” asked Twistey, as she approached him with an armful of materials and gadgets.<br><br>“The oldbies… or, rather, the four people who have apparently been on long enough to count as the true oldbies, are controlling everything in the PPC universe, Illuminati style, and have been for at least as long as the Mysterious Somebody ruled the PPC.” He paused. “Their ultimate goal is to obtain a ruling position over the Board as well.”<br><br>Twistey dropped a couple things and scrambled to pick them up, her face taking on a grim expression. “That’s not good.”<br><br>“What’s going on?” said a voice. Snowblaze emerged from around a corner, leading Jacob175 on a tour of HQ. With the two were 61516 and SkaterTheDJWolf. The four of them hurried over to hear the news.<br><br>Thoth cleared his throat. “I checked the Words today to see what was up in Fanfic World, and I found out... more than I set out to see. The oldbies are conspiring. They have control over the entire PPC universe, and they want to have the Board too.”<br><br>“We need to give them a piece of our minds,” asserted Twistey, as if that had already been decided upon. She put down her load and began searching through it. “There’s a Remote Activator here somewhere…”<br><br>“No need,” said Snowblaze, pulling one out of [her? forgot the pronouns lol] pocket. “Where are these oldbies meeting?”<br><br>“In a secret room in HQ, with twelve thrones.”<br><br>Skater shook his head. “That’s not enough detail to get us there.”<br><br>“Hang on,” asked Jacob, “can you explain everything to me? Like everything everything? I just joined, and I’m very confused as to what’s going on. Is this normal?”<br><br>“No, of course not,” replied Twistey. “The Board, as well as the writing of the PPC universe, is supposed to be a democracy. While in normal circumstances, the oldbies function as guides for us and do occasionally make jokes about this kind of thing, it’s never been a reality, at least on the Board. For the universe, apparently it was a reality all along. So, they of course want to spread their influence.”<br><br>“Oh.”<br><br>“Back to what you were saying, Skater,” said Twistey, “we can actually get the Remote Activator to hone in on a particular person, so there’s no need to figure out the room.” She turned to Thoth. “Let me guess, the four true oldbies are hS, Neshomeh… Kaitlyn, and…?”<br><br>“Delta Juliette,” finished Thoth. “We don’t know where they sit relative to each other.”<br><br>“I suggest we go behind hS’s chair,” said Twistey. “He’s the most fun to screw with.”<br><br>This prompted Thoth to shake his head. “Not in a serious situation, he isn’t.”<br><br>“Ah. Yeah,” agreed Twistey, trying not to have a flashback.<br><br>“Well,” objected Skater, “the more time we spend here debating, the more time we’re giving them. For all we know, they could be watching us, and they could be busy shutting down our tech. Behind Huinesoron’s throne it is!”<br><br>Twistey picked up her stuff again, Snowblaze opened the portal, and the five of them went through.<br><br>----<br><br>“Nobody saw us,” mouthed 61516 to the gang.<br><br>“Great,” replied Snowblaze, with equal silence.<br><br>Thoth thought. “We should take advantage of this and-”<br><br>“-surprise them really good,” interrupted Twistey.<br><br>Thoth frowned. “I was going to say we should listen in.”<br><br>“Wouldn’t it be better if we went for diplomacy?” asked Jacob. “They might be willing to hear us out.”<br><br>“That’s not going to work,” replied Twistey. “Go! Ambush!”<br><br>Skater gave her a thumbs up, then pulled out an MP3 player and speaker. He briefly flipped through the songs, then settled on “MEGALOVANIA” from Undertale. A perfect fit. He cranked up the volume.<br><br>As the music began and the newbies (aside from herself and Skater, who was staying by the speaker) looked for strategic places to stand, Twistey checked through the pile for anything resembling a weapon. Eventually, she figured that there wasn’t enough time to do so, and well, she had fire powers anyway. As the music grew louder, the four oldbies looked like they were realizing there was something up. Come on, don’t see us…<br><br>Upon the sudden change in dynamics, the rebels emerged from their hiding places around the circle and into view. Twistey leapt up onto a table in the middle for dramatic effect, her shoes lightly soiling the map of HQ that was on it. “Guess who’s here?!” The oldbies were noticeably startled, and fumbled for their weapons.<br><br>“Turn it down, Skater,” called Thoth across the room. “I need to talk.”<br><br>“Got it,” he replied, and lowered the volume.<br>Thoth approached the table and leaned an arm on it. “What is the meaning of this?”<br><br>Nesh was the first to snap out of her shock. “How were you able to enter this-”<br><br>“I’m not finished. Listen, I thought I trusted you. You were my friends, you gave me the support and confidence I needed when I needed it. And then you turn your back because of artificial divides created between the Boarders for the sake of you feeling superior?!”<br><br>Huinesoron crossed his arms. “If anything, you should be the one doing favors to us. We were here upon the founding of the Board. The PPC came together because of us. By that right, it belongs rightfully to us.”<br><br>“Well,” remarked Snowblaze, “if that’s the case, we’re the heirs of the PPC. We’ll inherit it when you’re gone.”<br><br>“Gone?” Huinesoron snorted. “I for one will never be gone!” On “never”, he flipped his hair over his shoulder, producing a chuckle from Kaitlyn.<br><br>“Well then,” asked Skater, “what about the other three?” He paused. “Sorry, that was dark. Before then, you’ll all likely get bored or tired of this place eventually. There’s no one who doesn’t. So you better treat us right, or we won’t let you come back to visit us after you’ve left.”<br><br>Then Jacob finally spoke. “If you do manage to get control over the Board and get it running under you like some kind of dictatorship, won’t there be no more new people like me? People will stop joining when they hear that the PPC isn’t any fun anymore.”<br><br>“We don’t need any more newbies,” asserted Nesh. “When we have the Board, and no, you can’t leave when we have the Board, we’ll have everything we need. Besides, newbies are too much to deal with. Case in point.” She gestured to Twistey.<br><br>“Hey-” Twistey swiveled around to look at Nesh. Then she stopped in mid-word, noticing the shadows cast on Nesh’s face. “Those overhead spotlights don’t look good on you, y&#39;know.”<br><br>“It wouldn’t have mattered that they don’t,” remarked Delta Juliette, “as we had never intended for anyone to see our faces in these lighting conditions except us.”<br><br>“But can’t you see <i>each other’s</i> faces? Can’t you see just how <i>evil</i> you look?” The human-decoy turned around to face Huinesoron, then jumped, briefly creating an outline of flames around her. “Oh God!” Then she whipped out her phone and snapped a picture. “You’re scary!” she laughed.<br><br>Thoth looked and then took a step back. “Oh shoot! Hah!” He looked at Twistey. “Please tell me you aren’t going to make a Wolfenstein 3D parody out of this.”<br><br>“What?” Then it finally clicked in Huinesoron’s brain. <i>“STOOOOP!”</i> he roared as he stood up from his throne. “I will have none of this slander! This is the last straw!” He drew a dagger from his belt.<br><br>Skater and Jacob looked at each other. “There goes diplomacy,” murmured the latter.<br><br>Twistey didn’t look up from her phone. “Oh, I don’t think you’re that bad, I just thought it was funny. Nice stern facial expression, it really drives home the idea! Anyway, what you really are acting like right now is a bunch of high school seniors in adult bodies.”<br><br>“Oh God, yeah,” agreed 61516. “Blah blah blah we’re the best and we get to boss everyone else around, especially the freshmen. You’re so right.”<br><br>Twistey sat down. “I like you guys. You do have a little bit of superiority, being older and wiser and having been here for longer. Nevertheless, I’m going to send this to everyone else. I’ll tell them what’s going on, and we will rebel. Because it looks to me like you’re gonna keep planning domination unless we do. Nothin’ ‘gainst you personally, I mean, there’s a little darkness in all of us. Capitalization on ‘darkness’ is your choice.”<br><br>And then she had to scramble off the table, for in that moment, the battle began.<br><br>------<br>Join the rebellion today at <a href="http://www.ppcenstein.org">www.ppcenstein.org</a>!<br></p>

            <p>I know you&#39;re a newbie, because you are not an Oldbie. Don&#39;t worry - we are all new compared to their magnificence.<br><br>It is certainly true that our fabled Oldbies, Kaitlyn and Huinesoron, are married; they are an inspiration to us all in this matter. Of course, their romance was founded on their growing dominance of the PPC, so we cannot follow precisely in their footsteps, but we should do the best we may.<br><br>However, unlike some newbies, we at the Society for the Promotion of Oldbie Dominion remember that the Oldbies and their namesake agents are entirely different people.

            <p>The S.P.U.D. in PPC HQ stands for the Society for the Procuration of Ultimate Dominion. There were originally twelve of them, though now they are down to just four. They would never use the term Oldbies of themselves, though of course they have been around long enough to claim the title if they wished to. To them, anyone who hasn&#39;t been here at least since the LotR movies were coming out is a newbie.<br><br>We suppose some newbies on the Board might consider Phobos to be a sort-of Oldbie, but we at S.P.U.D. hold true to the original meaning of the term. Phobos is far too new to understand the true spirit of the PPC; he should submit to his wife and her fellow true Oldbies, as should we all.</p>

            <p>None of the Oldbies are evil, because they&#39;re in charge of the PPC, and the PPC is good.

            <p>I really liked what Lemony Eggnog wrote earlier, and after talking with them for a bit I got a FANTASTIC idea for a story! The first part&#39;s really boring filler but I promise it&#39;ll get better!<br><br><b>Summary:</b> Ilraen finally gets a break and decides to make the most of it.<br><b>Rating:</b> M (Nothing that&#39;s NSFW in this chapter)<br><b>Pairing:</b> Ilraen/Everyone<br><b>Disclaimer:</b> I don&#39;t own the PPC; Jay and Acacia do. Ilraen and Supernumerary are owned by Neshomeh. Further characters will be attributed to their respective authors in the chapters in which they first appear.<br><br>Ilraen-Aroline-Fothergill entered Response Center 999, returning from the continually shifting and therefore unknowable halls of the PPC Headquarters. The Andalite’s partner sat on the bed, his gaze intent on the thick book on his lap. Agent Supernumerary didn’t so much as glance from the book to acknowledge Ilraen, not that the latter expected him to; when Nume was buried in his canon research, few things (apart from the [BEEEEEEEEEEEEP!!] of the console) could pull his focus away.<br><br>The console, for its part, was eerily silent. However, the Andalite did notice that an odd blue light was flashing on it. The alien walked over, pressed a few buttons, and pulled up the message.<br><br>   <i>To: All Agents<br>   From: The Sunflower Official<br>    Message: The Department of Sufficiently Advanced Technology has been having trouble lately with the system that generates portals. As such, no missions will be given until the problem has been fixed. Agents currently in the field must wait to complete their assignment until further notice.</i><br><br>&amp;ltSupernumerary? You’d better take a look at this,&amp;gt Ilraen thought-spoke to his friend. The surly Agent looked up with a grunt.<br><br>“If it’s not a mission and nothing’s on fire, it waits,” Supernumerary said.<br><br>&amp;ltWell… It’s related to missions,&amp;gt said Ilraen.<br><br>Supernumerary snapped his book shut; his concentration had been broken for too long, he might as well look at what Ilraen was talking about. “Move over so I can read,” he said, jumping down from the bed and walking to the console. Ilraen watched, his eyestalks twisting this way and that in an expression of anxiety of what his partner’s reaction would be. Nume stared at the message, reached for the flask by his side, and took a long pull. “Well, I guess that means more time to watch the latest Pokémon spinoff.”<br><br>&amp;ltWe got a vacation! Of a sort. But we finally get a break, and that’s your reaction?&amp;gt the Andalite questioned.<br><br>“It’s not a vacation,” Nume said. “It’s DoSAT screwing up. Meaning it will either take two minutes or two weeks to fix. It’s not a vacation since there’s no guaranteed time frame.” Supernumerary, having climbed back onto his bed, opened his book with an air of finality.<br><br>Ilraen tried to prevent his eye stalks from drooping, but he couldn’t stop the small glistening tear that rolled down his blue-green fur from his right eye at this rejection. He and Supernumerary had done so much together, saved each other’s lives, but nothing had come from it but a lessening of outright hostility. Sealing his mind off from others around him, the alien flopped dejectedly onto the lush grass below the bunk bed. As he did so, one of his hooves crushed a small flower, absorbing some of its nutrients, and an accompanying bolt of exquisite sensation shot up Ilraen&#39;s leg.<br><br>Ilraen started as if he’d been shocked, but Supernumerary didn’t react. He was used to his partner’s dramatics by this point; he was not exaggerating about only fire or the console being able to grab his attention for any period of time. Ilraen shifted to get a better view of the bloom with all four eyes, crushed as it was.<br><br>The flower was small, the outside of its petals all but invisible against the lush grass that ordinarily grew there; however, inside the flower was different. It was an amethystesque rich purple color shot through with rivers of silver and lapis lazuli blue. Ilraen couldn’t help but stare at it for a long moment before remembering what about it had caught his attention in the first place. The Andalite stood and stomped on the ground experimentally, drawing nutrients up through his hooves and confirming his suspicions.<br><br>The strange flower buds were everywhere, hidden among the shimmering blades of grass, and were far more nutritious than he was used to. They felt fantastic beneath Ilraen’s hooves; the Andalite couldn’t remember a more delicious sensation while feeding, even in human morph. A low moan escaped his mind as he frolicked, savoring his newfound euphoria, and Nume glanced up from his book, grumbling obscure obscenities under his breath. “Why must you insist on continually disturbing m—” Supernumerary said before he stopped, his mind etching the scene before him into eidetic memory.<br><br>Ilraen was posed like a dancer, his thin arms counterbalancing the rotation of his lower body as he reached the edge of the grass. &amp;ltApologies,&amp;gt the Andalite said, unable to keep the excitement out of his thought-speech. &amp;ltIt’s just that this grass feels <i>amazing</i> right now.&amp;gt Supernumerary was only half-listening; his attention was torn between the heady aroma of crushed grass mixed with something else, something on the edge of his perception that was nonetheless intoxicating and alluring, and the sight of Ilraen’s bare chest. Though Andalites are not known for upper body strength, it was plain to see that Ilraen was well muscled from the waist up. Supernumerary moved toward his longtime partner, wiping a bit of drool from his mouth, and cupped Ilraen’s soft cheek.<br><br>“Don’t worry about it,” he breathed, and planted a kiss where the Andalite’s mouth would have been if the latter had had a human face and wasn’t an alien from an entirely different universe.<br><br>The alien reciprocated, guiding Supernumerary’s more lithe but still powerful form against his own with his hands and squinting in his own version of a smile. When Nume didn’t resist, Ilraen whispered in his mind: &amp;ltI’ve always wanted to do this.&amp;gt Supernumerary simply smiled and let himself relax into the soft, luxurious embrace of his coworker, partner, and one true friend.<br><br><b>A/N</b> So, what&#39;d y&#39;all think? Please review, but no flamers! If you don&#39;t like good romance, just don&#39;t read it!!</p>

            <p>First, in response to your note: Okay but no. a) You didn&#39;t do that. I got that Ilraen was interested, but not even a hint of curiosity from Nume before the flowers. b) Even if you had, thinking about a thing is not the same as being ready and agreeing to do it. Nobody talked about this beforehand. That ain&#39;t consent.<br><br>As for the actual contents of the chapter... sigh. As usual, there is potential for good smut here. The characters clearly care about each other, at least, which puts you head and shoulders above some of the reprobates around here. But you&#39;ve botched it in so many ways by eschewing logic in favor of fetish and choosing your words extremely poorly.<br><br>For one thing, Andalite lower bodies are described as deer-like. A logical extrapolation would therefore give Ilraen a deer-like penis, not a giant freaky horse dong. Rather different anatomy there! Much less alarming, not to mention perhaps not goddamn impossible for a first-time unlubed anal penetration.<br><br>That&#39;s not even getting into what I assume was inspiration from the likes of Bad Dragon, which... I mean, fine? Aliens, who knows, right? But it&#39;s a <i>little</i> silly, though. And then you go and add greenish &quot;sweet milk&quot; with magical recharge powers, and I just can&#39;t. XD<br><br>Also, I have a list of deeply unsexy words that you are never allowed to use in a serious context again, but I don&#39;t think I can post them in the comments. Expect a PM from me shortly.<br><br>--Lemony<br><br>(( I&#39;m not going to message you.

            <p>No, wait, your edit says you&#39;re NOT actually blaming this on me.

            <p>A/n: What it says on the tin! I had a ton of fun with this one, guys. Hope you love it! Remember to leave me lots and lots and lots of comments **blows kisses**<br><br>obvs I don&#39;t own any of this its the ppc I&#39;m just playing with it~ pls dont sue! Or Sue :P<br><br>PS: all the chapters they go into are from Partially Kissed hero by Lionheart and they&#39;re read. I can&#39;t make this stuff up!! Each piece is a different chapter. Enjoy!!! r&amp;r? :)<br><br><b>The Many Partners of Jacques Bonnefoy (for the Legendary mission we know is coming!!)</b><br><br>Of all things, Jacques Bonnefoy thought, the last one he’d expected when taking this mission was to come face to face with the Queen of England.<br><br>“Ma’am,” he greeted. He was almost surprised when her response didn’t include the name ‘Captain Harkness’—but then, this wasn’t exactly his world, was it?<br><br>“Are you, perhaps, from the Queen of Wonderland?”<br><br>Jacques made a face. “No, ma’am. Uh—consider me…well, I’m a British citizen. I think. I—”<br><br>“Duck,” one of his partners advised him. He did so, and the story took over.<br><br>“I really don’t like this,” muttered the third of their number. He was noticeably Welsh, male, and young, in his early twenties. “Are you sure we should be <i>right here</i>?”<br><br>“Come on—you don’t want to see this mess for yourself?” The man who’d told Jacques to duck slung an arm around the Welshman’s shoulders. His accent was the slightly odd offspring of Received Pronunciation and Welsh with hints of Scottish poking through; he was also in his early twenties.<br><br>He also looked very much like Jacques, if only Jacques had still looked twenty-four himself and had grown his hair out a bit. Jacques had found out far earlier on in the mission that he was actually French; he’d first looked appalled and then laughed himself breathless when Jacques had switched to French with their prompting.<br><br>The Welsh-accented man, meanwhile, shook his head. “Not especially. Why do <i>you</i>?”<br><br>His friend shrugged. “Well, I’ve never seen it before…”<br><br>With a sigh, the Welshman turned to Jacques. “He’s always like this, you know.”<br><br>Jacques raised his eyebrows. “Did you want me to do something about it, Ianto? You’ve known him longer; I’m just his non-wizarding counterpart from another Headquarters.”<br><br>Ianto opened his mouth…<br><br>*<br><br>Jacques opened his eyes, confused. What had he…? Why had he…?<br><br>“Finally,” said his temporary partner. His name was Derik; apart from the heavy scarring on one side of his face, he was incredibly handsome. He was also just about the straightest guy Jacques had ever met, which was a complete and utter shame. “What happened to you not needing much sleep?”<br><br>“Time distortion,” Jacques said. “It’s weird, but true.” He stretched. “How long was I out?”<br><br>Derik raised his hands expressively. “You’re <i>really</i> overestimating my ability to tell time in this mess.”<br><br>“True,” Jacques said. “Well, let’s get moving, anyway. What’s up next?”<br><br>“Something to do with Hermione, loyalty, and…Stonehenge? Harry carrying a hospital’s worth of potions? I just skimmed it.”<br><br>Jacques made a face, and offered Derik a hand up. Derik stood up on his own—really, <i>really</i> straight, Jacques reflected.<br><br>“Well, then—let’s get going…”<br><br>*<br><br>“Mmph!” Luxury stumbled. Jacques caught her—easy enough to do, given she’d already been well on her way to pressed up against him. “What <i>was</i> that?”<br><br>Jacques tore his attention away to check the Words. “Uh—oh, wow. Treelawney just went thirty years into the past. Welcome to…what is it, 1963?”<br><br>“Eh, whatever,” Luxury declared. She pouted at him. “Are you <i>sure</i> we can’t lose the robes?”<br><br>“…actually,” Jacques said, once he’d had another quick look at the Words, “we can.” Luxury gave a gleeful whoop and pulled away to yank hers over her head. “But we do have to keep Muggle clothes on.”<br><br>Luxury narrowed her eyes at him. “You’re kidding, right?”<br><br>Jacques shook his head. “Believe me, I wish I was. But at least it’s fewer layers…”<br><br>Luxury pouted, and stuck her hands up his shirt the moment it was accessible.<br><br>*<br><br>“Not even a <i>little</i>?” Jacques asked. “Really?”<br><br>Agent Supernumerary folded his arms. “Really. Not even a little.”<br><br>Jacques sighed. “This <i>would</i> happen. You’re the hottest person I’ve seen all day, and you go and turn out to be <i>straight</i>.” He paused. “I really, truly, seriously can’t tempt you? I mean, you’re <i>gorgeous</i>.”<br><br>“And now you’re mocking me,” Nume informed him, and turned away.<br><br>“No, no no no,” Jacques protested. “Not in the slightest. Haven’t you ever looked in a mirror?”<br><br>Nume went deadpan. “No.”<br><br>Jacques groaned. “<i>And</i> you’re sarcastic.” He sighed. “We’re really going to have to sit through Harry’s dragon abuse with no distractions, aren’t we.”<br><br>Nume looked suddenly horrified. “No distractions? No! Definitely not. I can’t take that. We’ll just have to—”<br><br>Jacques raised his eyebrows. “Yes?” he prompted, trying not to look quite as excited and hopeful as he felt.<br><br>“Read books like the agents of the PPC that we are,” Nume finished dryly. He pulled out <i>Les Miserables</i> and began to read, completely ignoring Jacques.<br><br>“Right,” Jacques said, “of course. Nice.” He lay back, wishing he’d thought to bring a more interesting book along…<br><br>*<br><br>“But how can <i>you</i> be <i>straight</i>?” Jacques demanded. It was a fair question, given he was staring himself in the face.<br><br>The other Jacques shrugged. “Same way you can be…what are you, again?”<br><br>“Omnisexual!”<br><br>The other Jacques raised a sceptical eyebrow. “Is that even a thing?”<br><br>Jacques groaned and put his head in his hands.<br><br>In the background, Treelawney-via-narration was explaining a complicated, unnecessary, and frankly despicable plan which resulted, of course, in Harry turning out to be even more fit (and trained as a child by Bruce Lee)…<br><br>*<br><br>Jacques raised his eyebrows. “And who are <i>you</i> supposed to be?”<br><br>The striking…well, he <i>thought</i> her hair was brown, but it also seemed kind of golden—the young woman, anyway, looked rather offended. “But of <i>course</i> you know who I am!”<br><br>Jacques crossed his arms. “I really don’t.”<br><br>“But <i>everyone</i> knows me!”<br><br>Jacques smiled. “Tell you what—why don’t you introduce yourself, and then I’ll know too!”<br><br>The woman pouted, and then shook back her hair. A safe distance away, Harry, Hermione, and Luna lectured on about werewolves and the Ministry’s treatment of them. “My name is Jaycacia Thornbyrd.”<br><br>Jacques’ smile gained dimples. “Charmed, I’m sure.” He offered his hand; when she placed hers in it, he brought it to his lips. “I’m Agent Jacques Bonnefoy—but you—”<br><br>“Already know, yes.” Jaycacia looked only a little mollified, but she giggled when he kissed her hand again. “Oh, I can’t stay mad at you!” She batted very long eyelashes at him. “I just <i>love</i> your eyes.”<br><br>Jacques took a step closer, and then another. To his delight, she let him place her hand over his heart. “And <i>I</i> love <i>y</i>—” He froze.<br><br>Jaycacia frowned, and caressed his face with her free hand. “Jacques? What is it?”<br><br>Jacques yanked her hands away from him and took several large steps back. “Oh, no. No, no, no—I’m <i>not</i> doing this, I’m not—go back wherever you came from! I’ve already done my time in love with a Sue, I’m never going back—”<br><br>Jaycacia’s beautiful eyes filled with tears. “But I love you!”<br><br>“<i>No</i>!” Jacques insisted. “Get lost!”<br><br>He portalled her away before she could finish opening her mouth. Then, with the badfic almost completely forgotten, he set off to find a drink.<br><br>*<br><br>Gall was weirdly perfect, Jacques reflected. Oh, not in a bad way—not at all a Sue way. Not her. But she was…<br><br>Well, amazing, really.<br><br>“Come on!” she was exclaiming now. She’d looped her arm through his and was…well, the only reason she wasn’t pulling him along was that he was keeping pace. Rather easily, actually, given his legs were longer. “This may be the stupidest badfic I’ve ever missioned, but at least the breakfasts are good.”<br><br>Privately, Jacques didn’t fancy their chances—it was a badfic, after all—but out loud he said only, “And why are we going to need breakfast so urgently, Ms. Knutson?”<br><br>She punched him in the arm, and he fell the slightest bit in love. “It’s just Gall. And why <i>wouldn’t</i> we need breakfast?”<br><br>“I’m sure I don’t know,” Jacques said. He casually drew closer as they walked; she didn’t move away. “I <i>can</i> think of some great ways to spend the energy we get from it, though…”<br><br>Gall gave him a calculating sidelong look from her light blue eyes. “You know what?”<br><br>Jacques smiled. “What?”<br><br>Gall smirked. “It’s a good thing my partner’s not here. He can ruin a mood in <i>seconds</i>.”<br><br>Jacques grinned, and ignored the narration’s babbling about Harry’s new and calculated interest in things like ‘charming his own cheese’—which wasn’t even a euphemism. “So there’s a mood here, huh? Well, we’ll just have to make the most of it…”<br><br>--<br>((I&#39;d be completely open to writing a sequel/second part, with enough inspiration. I know this somehow got skewed pretty heavily towards Neshomeh&#39;s characters--it just kind of happened.<br><br>Got someone else you&#39;d like to see tackle Partially Kissed Hero with Jacques? Let me know! With luck (and any interest), I&#39;ll put them in a second part. ~Z))<br><br>(((Also, I had never considered Jacques/Gall. Turns out, I actually like the idea quite a bit! Who knew? Wonder how a meeting between them would go with her written properly in character, though, seeing as I went for the good old badfic games standby of &#39;aim for recognizable but don&#39;t worry too much&#39;...)))</p>

            <p>This seems to be a recurring trend with your writing.<br><br>Pros:<br><br>- Cycling partners and Jacque&#39;s varying levels of success at hitting on them is a fun idea for a fic!<br><br>- Everyone is very nearly in character, so it&#39;s even more fun!<br><br>- Some good jokes, particularly the &quot;charming his own cheese&quot; bit!<br><br>- Mechanically, it doesn&#39;t make my eyes bleed!<br><br>Cons:<br><br>- <i>Nearly</i> in character. Particularly, I&#39;m very unclear on who the first two partners are supposed to be (actual <i>Torchwood</i> characters?), and I don&#39;t get much Derik from your Derik.<br><br>- This &quot;excerpts from a longer fic&quot; format doesn&#39;t really work for me.

            <p>***ACHTUNG! Spoilers for Lichtspeer!***<br>Also, I&#39;ve been talking with twistedwindowpane about her plans for the PPC once she gets Permission. Agent Gretchen is hers, she&#39;s not mine, neither is Lichtspeer, go play the game, yada yada yada let&#39;s get on to the story.<br><br><i>It was just another day in the Department of Suspicious Canon (DSC). Agents were bustling about: walking briskly into generic offices, taking orders from their superiors, and then dashing back out to prepare for departure. One of several departments that had been created or re-opened due to a badfic explosion resulting from an announcement by MachineGames that fanmade content would be accepted for use in Wolfenstein V: The New Mastermind (bad freakin’ idea!), the DSC’s role was to streamline the PPC by marking certain continua as unworthy of protection in the first place. An agent in the DSC was to infiltrate new continua as made-up “fan characters” and search for any signs that the continuum was unworthy, mainly any form of prejudice unacceptable enough to take away any and all enjoyment of the work. The department had become very popular very quickly, with many agents happy that canon writers they hated could finally be done justice. It became known that if you had a vendetta, you could tell a DSC agent and it would be carried out. Sadly, as many of this department had axes to grind, they could quickly become overzealous in their work. One such agent was Agent Gretchen Hollehammer, who worked in the subdepartment led by Huinesoron. Who knows why she behaved the way she did, but anyone who so much as said “gentlemen prefer blondes” within earshot of her would be faced with her wrath. Huinesoron knew this, and perhaps he knew a little bit of her motives, for she’d often hint at things they’d experienced together before. Barely anyone knew what those had been. Today, she entered his office with a stoic expression, as usual awaiting a new mission.<br><br>As she sat down, Huinesoron smiled. “Why, hello there. Nice to see you again.”<br>He didn’t wait for an answer; Gretchen stopped giving answers years ago. “Given the particular causes you support, I have a mission that I think you’d especially like to carry out.”<br>The young woman nodded, one eyebrow cocked in suspicion.<br>    “Here,” he said, spinning around in his desk chair to retrieve a file and sliding it to her across the desk, then stopping his rotation to prevent embarrassment. In another hopeful attempt to excite her, he added with a dash of her personal slang, “This one doesn’t bite.”<br>    Gretchen took the paper without saying anything. She read through the information as Huinesoron got up and began pacing back and forth, explaining everything.<br>    “This continuum is called… Lick- oh yeah. Leaked-spear. Yeah, the spelling of the name was the first thing that tipped us off. Video game. It’s not new, in fact, it came out on Steam a while back, but a few Youtubers have been spewing out fanmade content about it for years now, and they’re finally popular, which has caused it to rise in the world of fanfic writing. It depicts a glorious ‘ancient germanic future’, with enemies such as ‘Penguin Vikings’ and ‘Wurst Zombies’, several areas and bosses for each, and fantastic technology. And the pinnacle of it all is this extremely blond guy, with a German name of the player’s choice, who wields an energy spear and is on a quest to… bring balance to the universe by killing stuff for the light god, I think it was. Sound like any propaganda from back when?”<br>    His employee was staring rather angrily at the paper she’d received, and she finally spoke. “Definitely.”<br>    “Aha, I’ve got you interested! To top it all off, the game’s motto adds to the fun: ‘Embrace the future. Eat strudel. Play Leaked-spear.’ Or... licked-shpeer.” He began mumbling other attempts at pronouncing “Lichtspeer” under his breath until she called for his attention.<br>    “Huinesoron, my mission.”<br>    “Oh yes, right. You’re going to adventure right alongside our protagonist, since that’s the only perspective given in canon, and pretend to be an ally of his. We’ll put you as one of those overly edgy assassin types, as an explanation for why you’re always so icy cold about everything. Fight alongside him, maybe question any sapient enemies if you can, until you figure out his motives.”<br>    “And if we’re right about said motives?”<br>    “That’s where your fan-made weapon comes in.” He opened a drawer and pulled out a jet-black sword that dimly glowed purple, inlaid with bright green gemstones in the hilt. “This is the Rave Sword.” He held it out to her.<br>    “If it’s any good, you don’t seriously expect me to grab it by the blade.”<br>    “Oh, sorry, sorry.” He stretched his arm out further so that she could take hold of the hilt.<br>    Then Huinesoron continued. “Like all weapons of the Licked-shpeer universe, this weapon has multiple abilities that you’ll get to use to your advantage. You can find those in the Licht shop with the protagonist&#39;s weapon&#39;s upgrades. Do you understand?”<br>    Gretchen nodded. She turned the sword over in her hands, obviously more interested. “I… I love the way this looks, and I can&#39;t wait to see what it does. I’ve always been a sucker for the… the aesthetic of black with glowy bits.”<br>    This made her boss smile. There was a little left of the old Gretchen after all.<br>    The stony look returned to her face. “Is there any other information I need to know?”<br>    Huinesoron thought for a bit, then spoke. “This game isn’t exactly of a genre you’re particularly good at. It may be very difficult to survive, even with this thing helping you. If you’ve got other things coming at you, please focus more on the other things coming at you, and not the German. Okay?”<br>    “Alright.” She started for the door, then turned her head to look at him. “Take note that this is the closest we’ve been so far to the kind of mission I was born to do.”<br>    “I will.”<br>    And so Gretchen left. </i></p>

            <p>The Lichtspeer hero, in this case bearing the default name of Hans, was waiting for the newcomer to arrive.<br><br>He checked over the description she’d sent of herself again. Her name was Electra, and she was a wandering assassin who had a unique weapon known as the Rave Sword. She came from far away, and was unfamiliar with the territories of the Lichtgods. Hans couldn’t think of anything that existed beyond, as the Lichtgods’ lands were so large. But hey, if she was willing to work with him, he was good.<br><br>Just then, there was the whirring sound of doors sliding open automatically. Hans closed the Lichtscroll and turned around to put it on the counter. The Lichtgod of Commerce, commonly known as the shopkeeper, took the scroll and watched the door approvingly as Electra strode in.<br><br>&quot;Yep, you&#39;re exactly like the picture provided,&quot; joked Hans, and the shopkeeper chuckled behind him.<br><br>Electra, on the other hand, did not find this joke to be hummorous, and remained silent.<br><br>He extended his hand. &quot;I&#39;m Hans.&quot; She shook it,a gain without a word.<br><br>&quot;Are you... mute, or just don&#39;t talk too much?&quot;<br><br>She looked like she was thinking. &quot;To quote Shakespeare, my voice is in my blade.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Impressive!&quot; He meant it. &quot;...I guess we should beam down now and you can show me how you use that thing.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I suppose you can also show me how you use yours.&quot; (A/N: That&#39;s what she said.)<br><br>And so, by way of futuristic transportation, they left.</p>

            <p>The high claxon of the console awakened the ruthless Assassin, Agent Dusk of the Department of Mary Sues. She sighed and pushed herself to a seated position in her bed, extensively running her fingers through her hair to tidy it to the smoothness it had been before she went to sleep. She pushed the covers back, swung her legs to the side in a graceful arc, and stood up out of bed in the same fluid motion, then turned the corner of her Response Center to reach her console.<br><br>It took her awhile to read the long fanfiction that greeted her on the console. It was set in the continuum of RWBY, and it starred a Mary Sue named Soluna Destiny, who was the princess of Remnant, initiated a spicy relationship with Ruby Rose, stopped the Fall of Beacon, and had the spectacular semblance of being able to turn her emotions into a magic essence that would immediately solve any problem she was faced with with no need for her to control it. It was the same fare that Dusk had warred and strived against for two months now - the same fare that had cost her her beloved partner.<br><br>“If you were still alive, you’d probably remark that I look like Ruby to some degree when wearing my formal attire,” remarked Dusk to the empty, lifeless air. “You always teased me about the things that were related to me in even the most superficial of ways.” The air had no reply for her, no words. If only Agent Cheyenne’s life had left her in a continuum that had some form of life after death, some kind of ghostly form she could use to get up and carry on. Maybe then it wouldn’t be agony. Dusk had been told since being recruited that she shouldn’t take her partner for granted because they might be gone for good, and those older agents could never be more right. Dusk missed her partner and that very fact alone filled her with a mighty vengeance.<br><br>The console blared again, clearly angered by the amount of time Dusk was taking to reminisce. “I’m grieving,” she snapped at it. “Do you not understand the concept of grieving?” She dealt it a swift kick, without a care about the consequences, and entered the bathroom to dress herself. Emerging in spandex pants, knee-high lace-up boots, a high-collared shirt, and a jacket with the DMS potted cactus on one sleeve and a Nether Star on the other, she pulled out the disguise generator and selected “Grimm”. “To Remnant I venture”, she mused, and stepped through the portal with a sense of emptiness in her heart.<br><br><i>[Author&#39;s Note: This is going to be written similarly to a mission at the beginning, but it&#39;ll transform into a larger, greater story as the plot continues. I hope this small bit of enticement makes you anticipatory of what is to come next! Also, WARNING: THERE WILL BE FEMSLASH AND I WILL NEVER STOP WRITING FEMSLASH NO MATTER WHAT YOU TELL ME SO IF YOU&#39;RE A HOMOPHOBE GET OFF THE BOARD!!!<br><br>With a salute,<br>Dusk]</i></p>

            <p>Dusk arrived at Beacon Academy, where Soluna started her adventure. Given the information from the fanfic that she replaced Blake Belladonna and started a relationship with Ruby Rose, Soluna Destiny was already disrupting both of the Team RWBY ships that Dusk felt with all of her heart should be canon. That made two charges, and Dusk had not even started watching yet. To be honest, Dusk could write down a list of every single charge while she was still reading the fanfic, and kill Soluna as soon as she saw her, but Upstairs would never approve of that, despite how brilliant of an idea it was. Quite brilliant, in fact. Dusk thus decided to do so as she was. Taking her pen in one hand, she wrote down every single charge she had encountered in the fanfiction.<br><br><i>[Author&#39;s Note: Bumblebee and White Rose are the best thing ever and anyone who says otherwise is a homophobe and needs to get off the Board.<br><br>With a salute,<br>Dusk]</i></p>

            <p>Seeing as it was the time of team-building by random selection, Dusk approached the courtyard and hopped up onto a wall, from on top of which she watched for her victim. Finally, she saw her target approach, and her heart skipped a beat. That was the issue with being an agent - reading about an incident or a character was nothing compared to seeing it happen in reality.<br><br>Soluna Destiny bounced into the courtyard. This does not mean that she was jumping or skipping, but rather that several parts of her were bouncing as she walked. The soft curls of her long tresses, shifting from gold to silver like an illusion in the wind and crowned with a circlet of deep blue and violet roses, bounced. The overflowing voluptuous mass of her body bounced. The crisp pleats of her dress bounced with it. There was an aura of beauty that emanated from her, and Dusk felt it strongly.<br><br>“I can’t,” breathed Dusk, and used the Remote Activator to return to Headquarters.<br><br>---<br><br>Dusk resolved to try assassinating Soluna again. Before she entered the fic, she read through it again. There were no problems she could see with it. All she could think about was how beautiful Soluna was. How strong. How loyal. How kind. She was perfect. Dusk wondered if this was the way of some god to punish her for being part of an organization whose job was to destroy such beautiful creatures.<br><br>She entered the fic again, trying to shake these thoughts from her mind. The charges came out mumbled.<br><br>&quot;I can talk to Grimm?&quot;<br>&quot;No. No, sorry. Sorry. I can talk to humans.&quot;<br>&quot;What do you want from me?&quot;<br>&quot;I... oh, this is such a mess.&quot;<br>Then it spilled out. &quot;I love you.&quot;<br><br>---<br><br>It turned out that the secret couldn’t stay safe forever. Dusk didn’t know how Upstairs had found out, but she was eventually summoned to the Sunflower Official’s office. A lump rose in her throat as she realized why she had been called there. Nevertheless, she had to set off. Expecting to be fired, she packed all her things into a Bag of Holding she’d stolen from a Dungeons and Dragons Sue, and walked down the hallway, feeling a sense of impending doom.<br><br>Opening the door to the office, she saw the Sunflower Official glaring down at her with fronds crossed. He was accompanied by a short, disapproving girl sporting both a RWBY-style PPC uniform and a huge bushy tail. A squirrel Faunus? That was a strange occurrence. Squirrel Faunus had never before appeared in canon. How could an agent possibly be something that had not been shown in canon?<br><br>As Dusk was wholly lost in confusion, the Sunflower Official cleared his throat. <i>Agent Major General Odile Severheart Dusk, there have been rumors circulating that instead of assassinating the Mary Sue Soluna Destiny, you were enamored with her and have initiated a relationship.</i><br><br>Dusk searched her mind for the right reply. “I… I admit, I did fail to assassinate the Sue.”<br><br>The Sunflower Official leaned even further over her. <i>The truth will appear in time. Are you sure you wouldn’t like to confess anything more?</i><br><br>“No, sir.”<br><br><i>Fine then. I have sent you a temporary partner, Agent Hira Katropher of the Department of Floaters, to help you carry out the assassination once and for all.</i><br><br>Dusk felt a bead of cold sweat down her face. What could she do now that she was being watched?<br><br>----<br><br>Dusk resolved that she would attempt to escape with her love when Hira wasn&#39;t watching. She knew that she could live in the RWBY continuum for the rest of her life, as she knew how to maneuver within it. She had nothing she was attached to in the PPC.<br><br>Eventually, however, when her plan was put into action, it didn&#39;t work. She was found.<br><br>&quot;So the rumors are true,&quot; stated Hira, with great disappointment. &quot;You two are in love.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I-I can&#39;t take it anymore!&quot; shouted Dusk. &quot;Yes, we&#39;re in love and I can&#39;t possibly kill her! Why would you ask that of me?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Because that&#39;s your job, and you two aren&#39;t supposed to be in love.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Homophobe,&quot; Dusk muttered under her breath.<br><br>Hira stepped back and tilted her head to the side. &quot;Wow! What a freaking knee-jerk reaction! Of <i>course</i> I&#39;m going to passively let you win the argument because you&#39;re lesbian!&quot; She got up in Dusk&#39;s face. &quot;No, stupid! The problem is that you&#39;re an agent and she&#39;s a Mary Sue.&quot;<br><br>&quot;There&#39;s no way that this is about her Mary Sue status! If you could let two women be in a relationship, you&#39;d also obviously be able to tolerate this as well, because love is love is love! You&#39;re a liar <i>and</i> a homophobe! Leave my relationship alone!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Agent Dusk-&quot;<br><br>&quot;LEAVE MY RELATIONSHIP ALONE!!!!&quot;<br><br>And Soluna took that as a cue to kill Hira.<br><br>----<br><br>Dusk tried sneaking back into HQ. It turned out that Hira was in fact a homophobe and was just using that as an excuse to cover up the fact that she was a homophobe, and so she was posthumously fired, and that the Sunflower Official had just never been introduced to the idea that Agent-and-Suvian relationships should be treated as equal and legitimate. He agreed to let Soluna move into HQ with Dusk.<br><br>The years passed. The two killed many homophobe Suvians together, making sure that Soluna&#39;s friends were spared by all of the PPC. They eventually were married, and by the powers of writing, had two daughters named Sol and Luna. Soluna used her magic to render immortality to them both and so they never retired from the PPC. However, they eventually got bored and let themselves finally slip into death, and they were made into constellations in the sky of the PPC universe.<br><br>The end.<br><br><i></i><br>With a salute,<br>Dusk<br><br>P.S. I managed to remember the HTML this time, yay!]</p>

            <p>I was a 40k fan long pror to seein PPC, so I wantd to writ Toth. Aslo, I alway ssee peolle misineterpet the obviouse and intricate romance arcs thsy have been set up for charsfters. Somekne here&#39;s alrwady postend Thlth/Derik—ewww. So wong. Here, I do my bedt to show show clearly what the correct intepretation of the character is for the nimrods. Obviouslu.<br><br>--<br><br>To Thoth, she had always ben “the lady.” Not that there weren’t others, but viewed through his emereld sight-speres, she was the one that deserved that deserved the most definitiv article. His alien mental complexixon made it hard for him to know what he was feeling: She iritated him, irked him sometimes, but when his gaze meet hers, an electric shock of energy traveleled through him, her ruby hair flowing acros her head like a river as if a magnet to his eyes.<br><br>Yes, just the thought of Gal made his heart race. He practically swoneed when he saw her, and it took his warrior sprit concintrated effort to not fall to her silky, seduuctive charms, to melt into her choclatey aura of condifence and desire, to present himself entire before that sner upon her face.<br><br>It finally reached it’s breaking point one day, when Thoth was wandring HQ, and bumped right into her. “O-oh… Gall! S-s-sorry…”<br><br>Gall smacked him straight across face, a snarlng picture of beauty. “Don’t give me that, ‘Jotun.’ Man up and stop being hestant about everything all the time. Always stutering and bushing… I know you can do beatter.”<br><br>Thoth rubbed his hands together, his face tranforming into a mask of flushed crimson even as his his heart began to throtle his brian.<br><br>Gall grabbed him close smaked him again, brething hard, her crismon locks glinting as her orbs did. “Go on. Prove you’re a man. Defend yourself. I’ll keep atacking until you do.”<br><br>Thoth blushed and rubbed his hands together. It wasn’t as if the smacs hurt, particularly, hed felt worse. But something about them shok him to his core.<br><br>Then sudenly, Gall grabed him roughly and shoved him against the wall, and he gunted roughly at the impact, his lungs quivring. Even with all his incredibly stren, he was powerless to defend himself from this scarlet demon. “...Unless, of course, this is just what you want I’ve seen the way you look at me, you saucy boy. Don’t you deny it. And don’t you forget that my ofer still stands… Do you want to get… undepressed, Joton?”<br><br>Suddenly, Thoth kised her, his lips locking against hers in an underpressed expresion of need and desire, the moist caverns joining together in perfect union as he releaseed a soft sonic vibraton of pure want, of ecstatic urge, the crimson vixien against him pulling him in closer and pushing her tongue into his mouth in an epression of reciprocatting want that he, in turn, returned. The lady pushed him back further against the bounddary of the hallway, her body and lips hitting his synapses like a wave of heat.<br><br>“Yes…” He said. “Please.”<br><br>Gall grined. “I thought you would, Jottun. Now all you have to do…” She fished around the comparments of her outfit throwing something to him. “...Is put this on.” <br><br>The artice the Astarts now held in his hands was a circlar collar, hen from lether.<br><br>--<br><br>((Yeah, I am writing one of my own. Hey, I&#39;ll branch out sometime, I swear! <br><br>Also, 90% of the typos in that intro post are real: Phone keyboards are better at creating plausible badficcers than I ever will be.))</p>

            <p>You have somehow managed to pick up on the small details from the most obscure source while missing the most crucial ones from the most obvious sources. How do you do it?<br><br>You get points for your actual story having better spelling than your comments, so at least you&#39;re making an effort there. That&#39;s more than I can say for some. And, though you kinda remind me of my own personal Johnny Snow, D4rkm0k, at least you set up a reasonably interesting cliffhanger instead of just ending it up with &quot;and then they did sex to each other.&quot; I admit to being curious to know if the collar is just Gall&#39;s shrinking device or if there&#39;s actually going to be a bit of bondage in this.<br><br>To be clear, though, Thoth is WILDLY out of character.

            <p>Time passed.<br><br>“Brother? . . . Derik?”<br><br>“Hn?” His eyes snapped open and he started up with a sharp intake of breath. He’d almost drifted off. How pathetic.<br><br>Thoth took his hand from Derik’s shoulder. “You are injured, and today’s mental effort has drained you. It would be wise to go and rest.”<br><br>Derik shook his head mulishly. “Stop trying to get rid of me.” He rubbed his face vigorously, stretched, and rolled his head to rouse himself further.<br><br>“I am merely pointing out the obvious. If you choose to resist good sense and stay . . .”<br><br>“I do. I waited nine days for this time; I’m not wasting it.”<br><br>Thoth nodded. “As I anticipated. In that case, I thought I might attempt to heal you, if you wish it, although I cannot guarantee such excellent results as I achieved with Nurse Robinson’s assistance.”<br><br>Derik thought a moment. He vaguely recalled Tom being very concerned about the Astartes using his psyker powers to repair Derik’s foolishly broken knuckle on the day they had met, but it had been perfect afterward, never so much as a twinge. Yes, Jenni had been there, but she had simply been supervising, he thought.<br><br>He shrugged. “I don’t see why not.” A thought occurred, and his mouth twisted into a teasing smile. “Are you trying to get my shirt off?”<br><br>Flatly, Thoth said, “Viewing the injury makes no difference to the biomantic healing process.”<br><br>Derik sighed and shook his head fondly. “One of these days, you’ll learn when to play along with me. Look, if it makes no difference, it can’t hurt, right? I’ll feel better if you see it with your eyes first.” He shucked his jacket and pulled his shirt off over his head.<br><br>There were actually several yellowing bruises across his torso, courtesy of the super-Stu’s fists, but the worst was on his left side, near the bottom of the rib cage but above the floating ribs, where he’d been kicked twice before Gall got behind the Stu and caved his head in with her mace. (She’d thrashed Derik a bit herself for hashing the mission and nearly getting himself killed, but her blows, moved by rough affection, hadn’t left marks.) The main injury was still a livid maroon in the middle with a blotchy blue-black corona.<br><br>Derik set himself on his stool and raised his left arm over his head. Thoth leaned in and ran his hand down the smaller man’s ribs, framing the bruise in the angle of thumb and forefinger. Derik felt a mild electric tingle as Thoth psychically probed the extent of the damage.<br><br>“I know it looks awful, but nothing is broken; I did get it checked. Medical cheerfully turfed me out with a bag of ice and some arnica gel.”<br><br>Thoth snorted softly. “Clearly an inadequate remedy. Your pain tolerance is impressive for a mortal.”<br><br>Derik rolled his eyes. “It only hurts when I breathe. But honestly, your psychosomatic techniques have helped, when I’ve been able to use them. For some reason, my focus has not been at its peak, which is how this happened in the first place.”<br><br>“Indeed.” Thoth sat back and studied the floor. He spoke through clenched jaws. “It is humiliating to admit, but my own may not be sufficient to perform this task.”<br><br>Derik lowered his arm and turned toward him. “What do you mean?”<br><br>“You are distracting me.”<br><br>“Well, I can shut up, if—”<br><br>“No. That is not the issue.”<br><br>Derik cottoned on and felt like an idiot. “Oh. <i>Oh.</i>”<br><br>He suddenly was aware of his bare skin. He was a warm brown, like many born in sunny Southern Boll Hold. A few stray Threads from the same clump that had scarred his face had bitten into his right shoulder, leaving scraggly white lines behind, and besides the recent bruises, he had a few other miscellaneous souvenirs from fights and accidents. The most prominent was an old lash across his left forearm, faded to a dully gleaming pink, that had been made by a snapped harp string. That had damn near crippled him. There was also a pair of jagged scratches across his belly, made by a young green watch-wher he’d rescued from some ignorant boys when he was ten. The wher had been so worked up and confused, dragged out of her den in daylight, that she hadn’t been able to tell him apart from her tormentors and nearly gutted him like a fish with a stray swipe of her paw.<br><br>All in all, though, his hide was remarkably intact, and he kept himself fit by running, working with weights, and swimming when he could (though he’d never managed to find the fabled pool in Headquarters). He had broad shoulders and a deep chest, full but not strained with muscle, and little hair except on his limbs. Exposed to the air, and to Thoth’s gaze, his nipples had puckered into dusky rose nubs.<br><br>“You haven’t seen me like this before, have you?” Derik sometimes went topless when he exercised, but he and Thoth had very different physical regimens, so that wasn’t something they’d ever done together. In the past two years, there was no other occasion he could think of where it might have happened.<br><br>“No. I have imagined, but I am no longer familiar with what might be considered normal human physique. The reality is . . . most pleasing.” He didn’t sound comfortable saying it, and he gave Derik that invitational look again.<br><br>Since Thoth was being forthcoming, Derik joined him in a state of heightened openness and perception. He felt the same turmoil of conflict as before between his friend’s intense affection and yearning for him and what Derik could only call dread of the consequences. Given the context, he thought he understood.<br><br>“You can still do it,” he said gently. “Your powers aren’t gone. You just need to focus them in a slightly different way.”<br><br>“If I were distracted and they were to fail at a crucial time—”<br><br>“Stop right there. This is not a crucial time. This is just you and me, learning something new together in our safe place. Take a moment to look at me if you want to—I certainly don’t mind. Then put all that aside, as I know you can, and do what needs doing. You are very capable, and I trust you.” He knew Thoth would feel the truth of that, and in return he tasted the bittersweetness of gratitude spreading through Thoth’s aura. “When I’m healed, come back to me, and we’ll go from there.” If he was still awake, anyway. Stringing all that together had been a major effort.<br><br>Which Thoth also sensed. His brows drew together in a crease. “I will ask no more of you today, brother. I shall do this, and then you <i>will</i> rest.”<br><br>Derik gave in. Fighting it anymore was too hard. “All right. I promise.”<br><br>“Good. Now, I request your silence. This may take a few minutes.” He closed his eyes and settled into a meditative attitude. His aura receded; Derik could no longer sense him.<br><br>Derik followed suit and worked on smoothing out his own mental patterns. It could only help if they were both calm and contained within the Enumerations.<br><br>Time was funny in that state, and it might have been a minute or an hour when Thoth finally opened his eyes and said emotionlessly, “Come to me. It would not do for you to fall from your seat if you should be overly depleted by this healing.”<br><br>That made sense. As Derik understood it, Thoth would use energy drawn from the Empyrean to speed up his body’s natural repair processes, but some of Derik’s own energy would be involved, too. He scooted back to the floor and sat cross-legged with his left side turned to Thoth.<br><br>The Astartes nodded and laid his broad hands on Derik’s back and abdomen, bracketing the injured ribs between them. Abstractly, Derik appreciated the warmth, but made sure to check himself at merely observing the experience, not getting swept up in it.<br><br>“I will begin,” said Thoth.<br><br>A stronger current of power than before made the muscles adjacent to the area twitch like the shoulder of a horse bothered by a fly. Derik didn’t remember the effect being this harsh the last time Thoth had healed him, but he’d been very drunk then, his nervous system depressed. It wasn’t painful, or at least no more painful than the swollen contusion itself, and Derik didn’t complain. He couldn’t see what was happening with Thoth’s hand in the way, but he could feel a bone-deep itch that waxed at first, then finally waned to nothing.<br><br>Thoth sat back and regarded his work critically. “Hm. It is not perfect, but you should no longer be in pain.”<br><br>Derik raised his elbow and peered down. There was still a faint tan stain where the angry red had been, nearly indistinguishable from his normal skin color. Within it he could make out what looked like a craze of filament-fine stretch marks, presumably where his subcutaneous tissue had reknit itself in an unnatural hurry. Rubbing it, he found no difference in sensitivity between this patch and the surrounding skin. He nodded. “Thank you.”<br><br>“The discoloration may go away in time,” Thoth said, frowning. “I cannot be certain.”<br><br>“It’s all right,” Derik assured him. “It’s interesting.” He traced over one of the pale lines with his index finger. “Think it might turn out to be a map of the London Underground or some such?”<br><br>Thoth opened his mouth, looking as though he meant to disagree, but thought better of it. “In this place, very little would surprise me. But, apart from that, how do you feel?”<br><br>Derik evaluated himself. He still clung to the lower Enumerations, but he sensed exhaustion waiting to claim him as soon as he released them, and he wasn’t sure he could hold on all the way back to his RC. “Would it be entirely too clichéd if I passed out in your arms?” He was only half-joking.<br><br>“It would be extremely clichéd. . . . But under the circumstances, perhaps it is an acceptable compromise between your desire to remain with me and my desire to ensure that you are properly rested?”<br><br>“Yes.” Derik pointed his finger at Thoth in affirmation. “Brilliant. Makes sense to me.”<br><br>So that was what they did. Thoth braced himself against the wall, and Derik leaned back against him in turn, secure in his tireless embrace.<br><br><hr>

            <p>The Duty intervened such that it was nine days before they were able to meet in RC 2112r again. To Derik’s chagrin, he had indeed suffered from second thoughts, both figuratively, in that he despised himself for having them, and literally, in that his preoccupation had made him careless in the field. On the sixth day, failing to duck under cover at a crucial moment had earned him a beating from a Stu with momentum-based superpowers, and he had the bruises to show for it. He had thought and imagined, fretted and planned, and after three particularly restless nights with an overactive brain and sore ribs waking him up at every turn, his eyes were shadowed and bloodshot.<br><br>To compensate, he had made an effort to wear freshly laundered clothes that weren’t wrinkled, and between missions he’d gotten his hair cut back to a faded crew with long fringe in the front, which the stylist had laughingly called “Gibbs hair.” Whatever the joke was, he liked the result: it made him look more like his old self, before all the bad things had happened and he’d stopped caring about his appearance.<br><br>He arrived bursting with talk, but Thoth refused to listen to anything he had to say until they had gone through their normal routine of mental discipline. Derik gave in with ill grace, but afterward, he had to admit it was a good thing to do. It put them back on familiar footing, and Derik felt less jittery with nerves and exhaustion.<br><br>He gingerly stretched and pulled out his stool. Even with a mat, the Generic Surface was hard, and the stool had the added benefit of putting him at eye-level with a seated Thoth.<br><br>“Now,” Thoth said when he was settled, “we may continue our discussion from last time.” The look in his eyes turned cold. “You must have realized, as I have, that to pursue a romantic experiment between us is both madness and folly.”<br><br>Shocked and hurt, Derik almost played right into it with a furious retort, but instinct made him dart out with his empathic sense, and he tasted the anguish behind Thoth’s words before the Astartes could fully conceal it.<br><br>“Don’t do that,” Derik said softly. “You don’t mean it.”<br><br>“It is the truth,” he replied.<br><br>Derik gave a frustrated groan and rubbed his hands over his face. “Thoth, please. I see through you. You told me how you feel; you can’t take it back, and I don’t want you to. What are you afraid of?”<br><br>His eyes flashed angrily at the word. “I am not afraid.”<br><br>“All right, not <i>afraid</i>. Anxious. Tormented. Whatever you want to call it: I have felt it. And last time you spoke as though you thought there was something wrong with you. I hope <i>you</i> have realized that’s not true.”<br><br>“It <i>is</i>.” Thoth blinked, startled by the vehemence of his own admission, and said more quietly, “Not in the way you mean, I think, but it is.” He sighed and shifted in place as though physically uncomfortable.<br><br>Derik knew he must be very upset indeed. His irritation evaporated. “Tell me, brother. Please.”<br><br>Thoth thought a moment, and then, not meeting Derik’s eye, he said, “You must understand that Astartes warriors do not feel the way I feel, regardless of inclination. It is impossible, except, perhaps, under the influence of Chaos. Or bad fanfiction, which is somehow worse. Much worse.” His lip curled, and his fists clenched. “I cannot become like the depraved excuses for Astartes in those stories. I <i>must</i> not.”<br><br>“And you won’t!” Derik got up and came to stand before him, placing one hand on his shoulder.<br><br>Thoth tensed and twisted away further, fighting a muscular urge to strike out.<br><br>“Oh, my friend.” Derik stepped back with his hands raised in a submissive gesture. “I do understand. How long did it take me to stop fearing I might become that other man with a face like mine?”<br><br>Thoth’s eyes flicked toward him. “Do you not still fear it?”<br><br>“Yes, and that’s the point. As you keep reminding me, fearing a thing does not make it true. You must trust yourself.”<br><br>The Marine jerked his head in negation. “I cannot. Blindly seeking my pleasure would lead down a path of destruction.”<br><br>“Then trust me.” Derik dropped into a crouch, trying to find Thoth’s eyes again. “I’ll show you the way. I will not let you fall.”<br><br>“You do not know what you are saying.”<br><br>“Yes, I do. I’ve had yonks to think about it, and this—us—we can work. Will you please look at me?”<br><br>Slowly, Thoth turned his head until he made eye contact.<br><br>In full view so it wasn’t startling, Derik reached out and took his hand. “It won’t be conventional,” he said. “It won’t be easy. There may well be pain and strife. But it will be worth it, because you make me feel almost whole again.” His throat constricted, and he roughly forced out the rest of the words. “I need you in my life. So I’ll have all of you. Every inch. Every fault. Every step of the way.”<br><br>Thoth’s eyes squeezed shut; his mouth pressed into a thin line; his fingers tightened around Derik’s hand. After a moment, he opened up again and raised one eyebrow a hair. “How long did you spend composing that little speech, Harper?”<br><br>Derik cleared his throat. “Ahuh, well . . .” He sat back on his heels and ducked his head, rubbing the back of his neck. “I did have nine days and most of nine nights; there were alternatives . . .”<br><br>“It was very good. I believe it has had the effect you desired. . . . It would be more correct to ask for your permission to kiss you again, would it not?”<br><br>With what he thought was a heroic effort of will, Derik managed to hide his bemusement as he raised his head. “No—because you already have it.”<br><br>“Then . . . let us attempt this.” He widened the circle of his legs and guided Derik to kneel there, which effectively eradicated the height difference. His hands rested around Derik’s waist. “Is that all right?” he rumbled.<br><br>“More than all right.” He laid one arm over Thoth’s shoulder and with his opposite hand stroked Thoth’s cheek where it had turned pink again. “So, then.” He had to ask. “You do still want this broken shell of a mortal man?”<br><br>“Do not disparage yourself,” Thoth said, peering solemnly at him. “This <i>is</i> madness, and folly, but if you will have all of me, I will have all of you. Every scar. Every hurt that will not heal. Every step of the way.”<br><br>Derik’s heart leaped and his eyes prickled. He laughed. “Shards, man. That really does work.”<br><br>“Indeed.” Thoth’s arms slid up around Derik’s back, pulling him in.<br><br>Just as Derik tilted his head to seal the kiss, Thoth squeezed his ribs in just the wrong place, and he hissed in pain and self-recrimination. “Oh, <i>shaffit!”</i> He should’ve seen this coming.<br><br>Thoth immediately removed his arms to his sides. His expression was pure stone, but a tidal wave of dread rolled off him. “I apologize if I have—”<br><br>“Nononono, it’s all right, it was my own fault,” Derik assured him, gripping Thoth’s shoulder and reinforcing his own psychic shields. “Shards and shells. I should have told you, but . . .” He shrugged and settled back onto the floor, gingerly massaging his bruised bones. He hadn’t wanted to talk about it, and he hadn’t been given an opportunity anyway.<br><br>Thoth grimaced; he knew. “You may tell me now, then. I did intend to inquire about your altered appearance, as well. Is there a connection?”<br><br>It was tempting to claim the haircut was simply because he’d felt like a change, but there was no putting one over on an Athanaean telepath, so he told the whole truth: he had been an idiot, it had gotten him into trouble, and he had spruced himself up so he’d look less like death warmed over for this crucial encounter.<br><br>“I didn’t want to distract you with any completely unnecessary concerns for my health,” he finished wryly.<br><br>“I see. In that case, you failed.”<br><br>“Rub it in, why don’t you,” Derik groused, turning his head in irritation; but he realized he might have focused on the wrong thing. He turned back, searching Thoth’s face for an answer.<br><br>Gazing steadily at him, the Marine said, “You will always fail at that.”<br><br>“Oh.” Derik had to look down. A silly smile was trying to take over his face. It was extremely undignified for a man his age.<br><br>“However,” Thoth added, “I approve of this haircut. It suits you handsomely.” He raised a hand from his thigh, but stopped. “I may touch you?”<br><br>“You really don’t have to ask,” Derik said. “Where is this coming from?”<br><br>“I am given to understand that enthusiastic consent is a necessary component of healthy romantic relations.”<br><br>Derik blinked. “You read some relationship how-to book, didn’t you? I assume this was <i>before</i> you decided to try and run me off?”<br><br>No answer, which was answer enough.<br><br>“Thoth . . .” Derik chuckled and shook his head in amazement. “My dear Thoth. You’re not wrong, and I appreciate that you feel the need for caution, but don’t let it ruin a perfectly good moment. Go on.” He leaned forward with his elbows on his knees.<br><br>Thoth hesitated a moment longer, as though he hadn’t understood, but he got past it and lightly brushed the back of one finger against the short fuzz over Derik’s left ear. “Quite different,” he remarked.<br><br>“I used to keep it like this all the time,” Derik said, his eyes fluttering to a close. “Easier to manage short hair with a helmet. Don’t stop,” he added when he felt Thoth’s hand move away. His scalp was still unused to being mostly exposed. Every stimulus was new and delightful.<br><br>“As you wish.” Thoth explored the gradient texture of the fade, eventually using his whole hand to rub up and down the back of Derik’s head and neck.<br><br>Derik sighed. “That’s nice.”</p>

            <p>Love is a grand, life-changing thing, but it doesn&#39;t magically make everything perfect! We&#39;re dealing with one guy who isn&#39;t supposed to be having any of the feelings he&#39;s having and is pretty nervous about the implications, and another guy who&#39;s <i>just bi enough</i> to swing over the fence but still typically more attracted to women and, as we&#39;ll see in Part 3, is a bit skittish about all the technological augmentations on his friend&#39;s body. They&#39;ve still got some work to do. But bear with it, and you, like them, will be well rewarded.<br><br>Don&#39;t worry, there&#39;s making out next chapter, too, you horndogs. ;3<br><br>--Lemony<br><br>(( Glad you&#39;re enjoying it so far! ^_^<br><br>~Neshomeh ))</p>

            <p>Over the two years Derik and Thoth had known each other, they had settled into a routine. They met in Response Center 2112r weekly, give or take: less often if the Duty interfered, more often if they had the chance or if one of them called for it. Their meetings had a comfortable pattern. First Thoth would lead them in meditation and lofty mental exercises, and then Derik would share a chapter of a book, a poem, or a song. They both expanded their canon knowledge in this way. Often they would discuss the piece afterward, which led to long, rambling conversations about life, the universe, and everything.<br><br>The room had slowly altered to reflect the needs of its users. There had once been a console, but then Tom had decided it would be clever to hack his way into it to alert his partner to a pending mission. Thoth had done the Duty, then promptly returned and torn the entire system out of the wall. Building Maintenance had patched the damage with concrit, but hadn’t bothered with especially good concrit, so now that wall was covered with curtains of swirled midnight and cerulean blue velveteen.<br><br>Thoth didn’t need much in the way of physical comforts, but he and Derik both had mats to sit on. When not in use, they were stored in a tall cabinet against the bare side wall, along with a pair of metal drinking bowls, a few tea tins and liquor bottles, and the occult paraphernalia of Derik’s psychic education. He was only an empath, and only a receiver at that, but Thoth still occasionally tested him for other manifestations of subtle powers, or engaged him in uses of his own vastly greater abilities. The room smelled of the incense and aromatic oils that had permeated the curtains, and the sweat of two men concentrating hard in a small, enclosed space.<br><br>Derik sometimes came here just to practice music without the distractions of his partner, her dragon, and the minis that shared his response center. Several of his instruments, nearly all rescues from badfic, had migrated here and not found their way back. Most were kept in the RC’s closet along with such things as spare strings, reeds, resin, and polish, but his favorite guitar lived on a stand in the back corner next to a small writing desk full of sheet music from multiple continua. He’d also acquired a three-legged, padded stool to sit on when he played, or just when he got fed up with the floor.<br><br>Today, Derik had sung a tune of his own making. He maintained that he was not a composer, and he was still reserved about singing, but his confidence that it wouldn’t turn him into a basement-dwelling madman had grown such that he was using his voice now as often as anything else. He had to admit, it felt good, and he was smiling as he returned his guitar to its stand.<br><br>“You performed that very well, brother,” said Thoth, sitting in his usual cross-legged position with his back to the RC door. As always for their sessions together, he wore a blue robe and, somewhat ironically, an enormous pair of sweatpants as a precaution against the Narrative Laws of Comedy.<br><br>“Thank you! I think the refrain still needs a little polish, but on the whole . . . ” Derik trailed off, suddenly feeling Thoth’s gaze on him. He turned. “What? What is it?”<br><br>“There is . . . something you should know.” The Astartes was looking at him with an unusually open and intense expression in his green eyes. An invitation?<br><br>Derik wasn’t sure what he would find, if anything, but he opened his mind. He couldn’t see auras like Thoth did, but after a lot of hard work, he had learned to separate the sensations of external emotions from his own in order to interpret them. He was instantly taken aback by what he felt, rolling off his friend in slow but powerful waves. There was no mistaking that heat, that ache, which rooted deep in the pit of the stomach and radiated outward. Derik’s breath hitched in his throat.<br><br>“But . . . I thought your conditioning did away with all that.”<br><br>“Mostly,” said Thoth, and Derik recalled that he had always included that word when the subject of his asexuality came up. “And it has been a very long time since then. The conditioning has, perhaps, faded.”<br><br>Derik’s head turned minutely back and forth as he processed what was he was being told. “Starting when?”<br><br>“Recently. In the last two months or so.”<br><br>“I had no idea.” Derik sank back onto his seat and pushed his long hair off his face. “Two months?” He couldn’t believe it—neither that this was happening, nor that he’d been blind to it, nor that his friend had hidden something of such import from him for so long.<br><br>“I . . . did not wish to tell you until I was certain.” Until this point, Thoth’s expression hadn’t wavered, but a slight flick of his eyes betrayed his anxiety.<br><br>“Certain?”<br><br>“Certain it would not go away. Certain it was . . . real. Yes.”<br><br>The full import of Thoth’s admission began to sink in. This wasn’t him telling Derik something strange that had happened during a mission, or sounding him about a perplexing interaction with other members of Headquarters. It was altogether more deep and more immediate.<br><br>“You are, then.” Derik’s throat had gone dry, so the words came out half-voiced. “You’re telling me . . . you want <i>me</i>.”<br><br>Thoth gave him a pained look that might have signified anything from irritation to pity. “Who else?”<br><br>“Oh, my friend,” Derik said, shaking his head. He didn’t know what to think, how to feel. “This is so sudden. And I’m not—you know I’m not—inclined that way.”<br><br>“Yes,” said Thoth, and he had closed himself off again so that the word was without inflection. “However, I thought it best to make you aware of the situation so that you may judge for yourself whether you wish to continue our association with this knowledge.” He rose to his feet, the slow unfolding of his massive frame always unexpectedly graceful. “I will leave you to think on it . . . brother.”<br><br>He turned and reached for the door. Derik almost let him go, mind and heart racing, but at the last second before Thoth turned the handle, Derik jumped up and put a hand on his friend’s forearm.<br><br>“Thoth, wait. Don’t be ridiculous—of course I want to continue! How could you believe otherwise?”<br><br>Thoth fell into one of his long silences, choosing his words. “This occurrence is . . . unexpected. Unnatural. Dangerous. Perhaps you would not wish to expose yourself to such a thing.”<br><br>“‘Thing’?” Derik scoffed, hearing the two-pronged meaning of the word even if it wasn’t intended. “Don’t say that. And how dare you imply that I would ever reject you for such a stupid reason? You should know me better by now.”<br><br>Thoth didn’t reply, and his face was set in the stony mask more typical of the early days of their friendship.<br><br>Despairing, feeling as though something precious was slipping away, Derik shook his head. “Don’t you understand? You are . . . ” He took a breath, sighed. “So many things to me. My brother. My mentor. My confidant. My greatest friend.” He tightened his grip on Thoth’s arm. “I’m closer to no one, not even my partner. Nothing can change that.”<br><br>“Perhaps,” Thoth said softly. “In which case, I could not become more than that to you, even if I were another mortal. As you said yourself, you are not inclined that way.”<br><br>“Mostly,” said Derik, and he had the satisfaction of seeing Thoth blink in surprise. “I was a dragonrider, and I was young once. I experimented.” He made a decision. On the end of another deep breath, he said, “For you, I would do it again, if you wish it.”<br><br>Thoth stood silently peering down at him for a long moment. He took his hand off the door handle and raised it to Derik’s face, using one broad thumb with utmost gentleness to stroke his unscarred cheek. It was such an incongruous gesture, and Derik felt his breath flutter in his chest.<br><br>His expression must have read as concerned, because Thoth abruptly pulled his hand back. “I do not desire your pity, or your condescension.”<br><br>“You haven’t got either!” Derik reached out and caught Thoth’s hand, clasping it tightly between his palms. “Read me, brother. Feel what I feel. I beg you.” Emphasizing his words, he pressed Thoth’s hand against his chest, over his pounding heart.<br><br>Standing like that, with the heat of Astartes blood radiating through his shirt into his flesh, Derik knew he wasn’t pretending his interest. And as he knew it, Thoth knew it, too. As his mental barriers lowered, his face softened, and a gleam of what might have been hope came into his eyes.<br><br>Derik smiled. “I only fear that I’m no match for you, in any regard.”<br><br>Thoth nodded slowly, never breaking his gaze. “The difficulty is . . . a practical one. Practical difficulties have practical solutions, for those willing to seek them. But let us not rush ahead. You are certain you want this?” His deep voice dropped to near inaudibility. “Me?” Psychic or not, some things needed to be said out loud.<br><br>“Yes,” Derik said, leaning forward into his touch. “More certain every second.”<br><br>A small smile twitched at the corners of Thoth’s mouth. “Your emotions still overrule you, brother. Have I taught you nothing?”<br><br>Derik smiled back. “You have taught me how to control them when I want to. Right now, I don’t want to.”<br><br>He pressed forward again. Thoth moved his hand around Derik’s shoulder, bent down, and tilted his head just so. Their lips met.<br><br>With the physical connection came a sharper, clearer sharing of feelings. Thoth’s attraction to Derik was like a landmass built up slowly over eons, finally breaching the surface of the waves that had buried it. It was subtle, but inexorable, and Derik thrilled to be the object of such power. The only feeling that had ever been more potent was—<br><br>Derik slammed his barriers back into place, and they both stepped back.<br><br>“I’m sorry,” Derik said quickly. He had caught a frisson of trepidation just before the connection cut off. “It’s not you, not you at all. It’s—<i>shards</i>, it’s what it always is.” He pressed the heel of his hand to his forehead and dug his fingers into his hair. He felt his anger rising and struggled to tamp it down again, repeating the first Enumeration in his mind.<br><br>“I understand,” Thoth said, but not without a hint of injury. “I recognize the signs in your aura.” He gave Derik a moment to collect himself, then said, “We will continue this discussion next time.”<br><br>Derik’s head snapped up. “What? No, I—”<br><br>“Yes. This . . . ‘experiment’ is as good a word as any. If we are to embark on this experiment together, there is much to consider. You must consider your needs and your safety. And I . . . I must consider whether I truly wish to become what this may make of me. It may not be worth the pain for either of us.”<br><br>Derik knew that if the two of them couldn’t live with pain, they would both have died long before they met. He knew that Thoth was one of the people in his life who made it bearable—better than bearable. Occasionally, even wonderful. And he didn’t give a shriveled fig for his safety.<br><br>He couldn’t muster the words to say all this, and he didn’t know if Thoth was still reading his aura. He said: “I won’t change my mind, if that’s what you’re thinking.”<br><br>“I know you believe so. You are a stubborn man. It is sometimes quite irksome . . . and endearing.” Tentatively, he extended his hand, and when Derik took it without hesitation he pressed his lips together in a grim smile. “You would leap into a fire, knowing you would burn. So I tell you: Go home, brother. Consider long and well. I am patient. I can wait.”<br><br>“Patience isn’t always a virtue,” Derik muttered, frowning down at their feet. He hated that his psyche still was not proof against intrusive thoughts of the past and the attendant soul-deep agony of his loss; that he could be so rapidly chilled, as though someone had thrown a bucket of ice over him. He wanted the fire back.<br><br>But, he recognized that leaping into this would end up burning both of them. There was indeed much to consider.<br><br>He looked up to meet Thoth’s eyes again. “You’re right. We can’t go off half-cocked, as it were.”<br><br>No response to the admittedly tasteless joke.<br><br>Derik shook his head. “All right, don’t laugh. The point is, I’ll do as you say, because you’re smarter than I am. We will go—and when we meet again, we will make a plan.”<br><br>“As you say.” Thoth inclined his head. “Until then.”<br><br>He turned toward the door, but Derik was still holding his hand and didn’t let go.<br><br>“Brother?”<br><br>“Once more,” Derik said, turning up his chin. “Please. So you know there’s nothing wrong with it.”<br><br>Thoth hesitated, and Derik thought he might refuse. Just before he resigned himself to give up, though, Thoth responded, “As you wish,” and leaned down, supporting Derik’s back with his off-hand.<br><br>Derik was careful to keep his empathic sense locked down and simply focused on the physical sensation of the kiss. It was odd—Thoth’s mouth was over-sized, and his own was distorted by scar tissue. It was awkward, with the ten-inch height difference between them. It was, frankly, underwhelming.<br><br>Part of the problem, he realized with a twinge of compassion, was that Thoth had no idea what to do beyond the basic act of touching lip to lip. It was a skill he had not practiced for millennia, no exaggeration, and he was stock-still, stiff, barely even breathing.<br><br>Derik was out of practice himself, but at least the instinct was still there. With both hands, he reached up to stroke the smooth-shaven sides of Thoth’s head. His scalp felt warmer than the rest of him, and with hands like heating pads, that was saying something. Derik felt Thoth’s fingers clench into his jacket at the unfamiliar, too-familiar touch and was reminded of the Astartes’ sheer strength. One wrong move, and Derik’s life could be in very real jeopardy.<br><br>Perhaps that <i>was</i> something to think about later.<br><br>Thoth didn’t pull away, so Derik continued the motion, drawing his hands down slowly over Thoth’s ears and cheeks until they rested along his jaw. Like the rest of him, his face was heavily boned and thick with hard muscle, courtesy of the super-engineered growth hormones that went into the making of a Space Marine. The only softness to it was in his generously proportioned lips.<br><br>With that thought, Derik opened his mouth, just a little, and pulled Thoth’s upper lip into the gap, which it filled pleasantly.<br><br>Thoth made a low rumble in his throat: a hum of surprise or the start of a moan, Derik wasn’t sure. Either way, he broke it off there and withdrew altogether. He looked at Derik with inscrutable eyes. A light flush colored his pale cheeks a shade of rose.<br><br>“There, now,” Derik said, his voice roughened around the edges. “That was a kiss worth the name.”<br><br>No answer.<br><br>Derik grew concerned. “Are you all right with what I did?”<br><br>A curt nod. “Are you?”<br><br>Relief set loose a giddy laugh. “Yes! Trust me, please. This is real. I promise you.”<br><br>“I will not hold you to any promise that comes with so little thought as to the consequences,” Thoth said sternly. Before Derik could protest, he added, “But I thank you for the intent behind it. And for . . . ” Lost for words, he made a helpless gesture toward Derik.<br><br>He understood, and nodded.<br><br>Before things could get any more awkward, they left the room and went their separate ways, until next time.<br><br><hr>

            <p>How absolutely adorable.<br><br>However, while it might but cute, it lacks all sophistication. It feels unrealistic and fake. This isn&#39;t what two <i>men</i> would do with one another. Or even one man. What I&#39;m saying is, where&#39;s the <i>uke</i>, the <i>alpha</i> in this relationship? We all know that men are obsessed with hierarchy, and this is well-depicted in most Yaoi, and particularly well in ABO. But in your work, much like that trash <i>Umibe no Etranger</i> (worst $15 I ever spent on a manga), there&#39;s no hierarchy at all, no expressions of power through sexual dominance. It&#39;s unnatural. Not how I&#39;d write the ship at all.<br><br>((...And for a moment OOC where I stop lying, I totally and completely love this story, and Thoth is about as IC as it&#39;s possible for him to be in a story like this here, and it&#39;s cute and adorable and basically great, and everthing I said up there is the reverse of everything I think. Including the bit about <i>Umibe no Etranger</i>, which I haven&#39;t finished, but has been pretty decent as Yaoi goes so far.<br><br>So yeah, this is amazing. Thus, if I do this ship, I&#39;ll do it in a way that is brain-bleachingly awful.<br><br>~Thoth))</p>

            <p>Oh, boy. That&#39;s not an expression of exasperated disbelief—okay, it is, but I am also addressing you as the misguided kid I assume you are.<br><br>Listen, girl. It sounds like you&#39;re getting all your ideas about sex, specifically between men, from a certain class of fanfiction. And you know what? Liking that stuff is fine. I ain&#39;t here to kinkshame anybody. If you and your hypothetical partner wanna role-play like that, and you&#39;re both equally into it, and you know how to do it safely, sanely, and consensually, that&#39;s great! You do you.<br><br>Thing is, though, fanfic is not real life. If you approach the kink in real life the way the pe—<br><br>... the way the hu—<br><br>(Deep breath, Lemony, you can do this.)<br><br>... the way <i>the <s>caricatures</s> <b>characters</b> in those stories</i> do...<br><br>(Got there!)<br><br>... wait, what was my point again?<br><br>Oh, right. I have several. 1) HEALTHY relationships are founded on good communication. 2) The sex acts you like to perform or have performed on you have nothing to do with your value as a(n) [insert gender/sex/orientation here]. 3) There&#39;s no such thing as an &quot;alpha&quot; or &quot;beta&quot; or &quot;omega&quot; in real life—no, not even in wolves. Do not get me started on wolves. And 4) &quot;expressions of power through sexual dominance&quot; is not how decent human people behave toward people they care about!<br><br>Unless, of course, it has been thoroughly discussed beforehand and everyone involved has given their enthusiastic consent, secure in the knowledge that they can use their safeword and end the scene at any time. That&#39;s different.<br><br>So. Before you lecture me on my level of sophistication again, maybe you wanna read some stuff that wasn&#39;t written by Coneheads purporting to represent actual human behavior first? Better yet, pick up some proper literature on the subject of sex and sexuality. Don&#39;t be shy: curiosity is normal! Please, for the love of little green apples, PLEASE explore outside the shitty relationship box!<br><br>--Lemony<br><br>(( Well that got longer than I intended. Sheesh.

            <p>Hello, everyone. My name is Jacob and I would like to become a part of your community.<br><br>I found the PPC through TVTropes a few months back and became interested in it after reading the original series. After thumbing through most of the wiki and seeing all it had to offer, I felt like this was a place I would want to hang out in and decided to join the boards.<br><br>What I mainly hope to contribute is this place is, besides having someone else to converse with, is providing feedback and partaking in your activities. I might have a bad fic or two I&#39;m willing to suggest that might be of interest to you.<br><br>I suppose the big question you&#39;re wondering is if I want to try my hand at writing for you fellows. Truthfully, I&#39;m kinda on the fence about that. I do have some characters I&#39;ve toyed with re-purposing for use here, as well as an idea or two for interludes, but my primary creative interests lie elsewhere and my writing would take quite a while to get done. If I do ask for permission, my stories would all be humorous or deconstructive parodies at most. I really don&#39;t do serious writing.<br><br>Thanks for reading all this and I hope I can fit in well here.<br><br>Fandoms: Mario, Sonic, Mega Man, Sword Art Online, Strike Witches, Dragonball Z, Super Smash Bros, MCU, Panty &amp; Stocking with Garterbelt, Star Ocean, Neptunia, Another Code, Touhou<br>Favorite Characters: Ashley Robbins (Another Code), Neptune (Neptunia), Mario, Sonic<br>Lust Objects: Jessica Robbins (Another Code), Vert (Neptunia), Reimu Hakurei (Touhou)</p>

            <p>Hello, and welcome aBoard! For your newbie gift, take this plate of freshly-made SPaGhetti!<br><br>If you haven&#39;t yet read them, may I point you towards <a href="http://plotprotectors.tripod.com/TOS/">the Original Series</a> and <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=18hztHpDehxcfrjaXoFUew1vb0BdZPDAusHxMHzHiCzM">the Constitution</a>? They&#39;re pretty much the only required reading around these parts. Another useful resource you might use is <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/PPC_Wiki&lt;br%20/&gt;">the Wiki</a>; if you have any questions, just look here before asking. We like it when newbies do the research.<br><br>And don&#39;t worry about writing humorous, deconstructive parodies! If you poke around, you&#39;ll find out that&#39;s what PPC writings are all about. (Ignore my missions. They are very much Out There and not at all representative of the typical tone. Just getting that out there now.)<br><br>Sounds like you&#39;re going to fit in just fine here. :)</p>

            <p>Well, technically I finished it five days ago, just took me a while to finish ye Board post. Sunburns are no good for my productivity. I would&#39;ve finished the census sooner, too, but trying to answer all the questions as accurately as I could turned out to be more time consuming than I anticipated. On the plus side, I learned a few things about myself.  Apparently I learned to read much sooner than I thought I did, and my mother was a bit afraid I might have been mute until age three. I also hadn&#39;t realized I&#39;ve been writing for <i>seven freaking years!</i> Kinda wish I&#39;d done more in that time, but still, how time flies when you&#39;re having fun, eh?</p>

Here in 2018, that&#39;s down at 40%, having hit an all-time low of 23% back in 2016. Part of that drop has been the inclusion of various &#39;Other&#39; options since 2010, but mostly it&#39;s a rise in male Boarders.<br><br>-Percentage straightness (blue line). The questions on orientation have offered a wide range of options over the years (2011 had eight choices, the last few years have settled on 5), but for a simple graph like this the &#39;straightness&#39; trend is easiest to plot. It stood steady at 50% for the first few years, but has dropped steadily since 2016. (Now, does that say something about the PPC, about fandom, about the internet, or about society as a whole?)<br><br>-Modal age, because how else am I going to plot age on these things (green triangles)? This has mostly kept rising, though the polymodal years obscure this a bit (see 2014&#39;s three triangles, or 2017&#39;s two). On years where there is one clear leader, however, it&#39;s tending to increase.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I actually wrote original stories decades ago (and got one SF story published), but the current answer to &quot;Do you write original stories?&quot; is &quot;No&quot; and thus I didn’t get to answer the other questions for &quot;Original Stories&quot;. (I didn’t create outlines and didn’t use beta readers then, and I don’t remember much of what I wrote or how much I finished, but there were only two stories I actually dared to show to somebody.)<br><br>The long answer to &quot;Do you write fanfiction?&quot; would be &quot;Yes, three very short <i>Harry Potter</i> stories over the last four years, which may not be enough to give valid answers to the fanfiction questions, but I answered anyway.&quot;<br><br>My answer to &quot;Do you create outlines for your fics?&quot; has always been and still is &quot;No&quot;, but thinking about it, I usually take excerpts from the canon scenes I want to use as background, and then write around them, so you might say that J.K. Rowling did the outlines for me.<br><br>Over the last few years, I finished everything I started, but that’s not surprising, considering how short my stories are and that I may think about what to write for years, but only actually start writing  when I’m sure that I can finish it within a few days.<br><br>I don’t feel like writing my annual <i>Harry Potter</i> fanfiction this year, but since I can’t even decide what I want to write, the answer to &quot;How often does writers block hit you <i>while</i> writing fanfics?&quot; is still &quot;Never&quot;.<br><br>I actually knew about fanfiction <i>long</i> before I discovered the <i>Harry Potter</i> fandom in 2007, but never felt inclined to join a fandom. Thus, the discrepancy between discovering fandom in 2007, but reading fanfiction before 1990.<br> <br>Apparently I caught a severe case of writers block on getting Permission, and being made a Permission Giver didn’t help at all. (Because I’m now responsible to <i>do it right</i> and write something <i>worthy</i> of the PPC? I have no idea whether this may be the cause.) So, I didn’t create a spin-off yet.<br><br>But I <i>did</i> prepare an outline for the one mission I didn’t write yet (as a workshop exercise done long before I got Permission).<br><br>I <i>did</i> write non-mission stories that still use the PPC universe as the setting, but all but one (the Friday 13<sup>th</sup> event that may or may not have been just a nightmare) are non-canonical writing exercises done before I got permission.<br><br>HG</p>

            <p>I&#39;d like to open by thanking Larfen J. Stocke for betaing these prompts for me and checking over my character bios.<br><br>And without further ado I&#39;d like to request permission for the following agents to take up residence in RC 423 as members of the Department of Mary Sues, Freelance Division.<br><br><h2>Agent Bios</h2>
<br><h3>Sophie List</h3>
<br>Sophie was born an only child in World One and grew up in Tucson, Arizona with her parents, having a fairly normal childhood. She graduated college at 23 with a BA in English and no real idea of what to do with her life: up until then everything had been decided for her and she had never had to make any major decisions for herself. Her parents wanted her to get a job, so she went out one day to walk down to the local grocery store and ask for a job. On her way there, she accidentally wandered through a plothole into the PPC and asked for a job. The PPC being the PPC, she was hired and immediately assigned to the division most in need of people at that point in time: the DMS.<br><br>She’s white, with short black hair, brown eyes, and freckles. She is around 5’6” and tends to dress in baggy clothes. This is because she thinks she is larger than she actually is and keeps buying clothes that are too big. She’s vastly unruffled by most things, which can be a strength or a weakness. It takes a lot to shock her, but at the same time she often lets things slide that she really ought to question, and sometimes it comes across as airheadedness. Sometimes it is airheadedness. She’s peppy and a bit bossy, especially with people she’s supposed to have some sort of relationship with, such as roommates or partners. And even though it takes a long time for her to get riled up, once she <i>does</i> get riled up she explodes and refuses to be calmed down. She also tends to hold grudges.<br><br><h3>Thorongir “Theo” Dúnedan</h3>
<br>Theo was a Dúnedain Ranger bit character recruited from a <i>Lord of the Rings</i> suefic.<sup>1</sup> He might almost have assimilated back into the canon, except he was a “Ranger of Erebor” and when this discrepancy was pointed out to him he nearly suffered a mental breakdown from attempting to reconcile two conflicting sets of memories; one of growing up and spending most of his life in the shadow of the Lonely Mountain and the other of a more typical Ranger’s life. The agents assigned to the fic brought him back to FicPsych. After his memories were stabilized he asked for a job. One of the agents who rescued him picked the name Theo for him, as Thorongir is only one letter different from a canonical name.<br><br>He requested a DMS <i>Lord of the Rings</i> division assignment because he wanted to still visit and protect his home continuum. After a few months he switched to DMS Freelance division, where Sophie List was eventually assigned as his partner.<br><br>Theo is a problem solver, good at finding solutions where they aren’t readily apparent and repurposing items to be whatever he needs at the time. He discovered a love for all things mechanical during his first few months as an assassin. Observing and understanding situations is key to solving problems, and Theo is the sort who thinks more than he talks. He’s not good at dealing with failure, however.<br><br>He wears his hair in a ponytail most of the time. There is sun damage on his face and arms, because sunscreen doesn’t exist in Middle-earth, and he’s six feet and a quarter inch tall.<br><br><h2>Writing Samples</h2>
<br><h3>One agent moves into another’s RC</h3>
<br>“Is that a <i>car</i>?”<br><br>Theo peered around the hood of the vehicle to take in the person standing in the door. The newcomer was looking around with the confused expression typical of someone trying to figure out how the room’s bottom half was bigger than its top half while the walls remained perfectly perpendicular. “How did you fit an entire car into your RC?” she asked.<br><br>“It seems you are my new partner,” Theo said. The car did fit into the RC, but just barely, so he had to press his back against the wall and lean forward in order to ease past it so he could approach the newcomer. “My name is Theo. I’m from the <i>Lord of the Rings</i> continuum. I’m pleased to make your acquaintance. Where are you from?” He held out a hand stained with engine grease for the other agent to shake.<br><br>She grabbed it and shook enthusiastically while still looking around at the car-filled RC. “Sophie List,” she said. “Earth, I guess. Do you sleep in the car? I’ve never slept in a car before.” She seemed rather unconcerned that Theo hadn’t answered her first question yet. “Can we move it over? I have a TV I want to put in here. I guess I could set it up on the hood.”<br><br>“It doesn’t belong to me,” Theo said. “I do car maintenance sometimes for extra money. It will be gone tomorrow. And no, I do not sleep in the car. There are bunks built into the wall by the bathroom.” Instead of indicating the place in question he leaned over and picked up the bag she’d set down in the doorway, hefted it for a moment, and then tossed it toward the bunks. It landed half on and half off the top, teetered for a second, and then settled.<br><br>“Ooh, dibs on top!” Sophie said.<br><br>“I’ve been living here for four months already,” Theo said. “I get dibs. Fortunately for you, I chose the bottom. And which Earth?”<br><br>“Earth earth,” Sophie said. “I think someone called it World One? Earth earth. So how do you fit an entire car in your RC? It’s the grey, isn’t it? Everything in this place is probably bigger than it looks.”<br><br>“I see,” Theo said. “You’re a <i>newbie</i>.”<br><br>“Yeah,” said Sophie. “Car. RC. How?”<br><br>“It’s a trophy I won from a ‘Sue. Are you familiar with <i>Doctor Who</i>?” The last sentence was punctuated with a peculiar twitch of the brow that Sophie recognized as the longsuffering look of someone who was looking forward with despair at the many things they would have to explain. Some of her worse college professors had worn it nearly perpetually.<br><br>She chose to ignore it. “Yeah! Well, the new series, anyway.”<br><br>“She had a chameleon circuit that made her TARDIS ‘bigger on the bottom’.”<br><br>“Huh,” Sophie said, lowering her eyes as she considered that. “I didn’t think the chameleon circuit --”<br><br>“It doesn’t,” Theo said. “‘Sues aren’t known for their knowledge of the canons they inhabit.” He started to edge back around the car. “No need to stand in the door. In fact, close it, if you would. There’s space in the bathroom.”<br><br>Sophie closed the door and then sat on the hood of the car and swung her legs over it. “Don’t do that,” Theo said. “You’ll scratch the paint.”<br><br>“I won’t scratch the paint,” Sophie said from the entry to the bathroom. “I’m wearing cotton clothes and canvas tennis shoes. How would I even scratch the paint?”<br><br>“I see you are new here,” Theo said. “You’ll soon learn not to ask questions like that, unless you would like to hear the answer.”<br><br>“Questions like what?” Sophie said. “How to scratch paint?”<br><br>“Do things that should be impossible,” Theo replied. He looked at Sophie over the top of the car, brushing wisps of hair that had come loose from his ponytail behind his ear. “Haven’t you talked to a Flower yet?”<br><br>“You mean like that big Daisy? Yeah, he gave me the job!”<br><br>“And I suppose he expects me to train you. The message notifying me of that should be in any minute now.” As if on cue, the console emitted an earsplitting <i>BEEEEEEEEEEEEEP</i>.<br><br>“Is that the message alert sound?” Sophie yelled, slapping her hands over her ears.<br><br>Theo didn’t respond until he had managed to edge over to the console and turn it off. “No,” he said. “That’s step one of your training.”<br><br><h3>The Agents Talk about Lust Objects</h3>
<br>Sophie leaned over the edge of the top bunk, hair falling floorward as she made eye contact with Theo in the bunk below her. “I’m just saying,” she said. “It’s a good look.”<br><br>“I’m sure it’s a very good look, if you are into that,” said Theo, stalwartly continuing to read his <i>PC World</i> issue. “Please stop talking about him.”<br><br>“I mean, you can probably pull the look off too,” Sophie said. “But you’re <i>you</i>, and you’re my partner, and no.” She thought Theo wasn’t really reading; he’d already read this issue three times.<br><br>“It’s not that,” Theo said. “You’re making me uncomfortable.”<br><br>“Okay, okay, I get it, not your type,” Sophie said. “But he’s definitely <i>my</i> type. Some people say the whole never-washes-his-hair thing is a turn off but I actually <i>like</i> it. He has a job to do and it’s more important than things like showers. And, y’know, you aside of course, I really like the whole long hair thing and he’s very muscular and just generally <i>yummy</i>.”<br><br>“I get it!” Theo said. “Your registered <i>Lord of the Rings</i> lust object is Aragorn! If you keep talking about it I’ll report you and Upstairs will have you watching the No-Drool Videos!”<br><br>“It’s <i>okay</i> to have lust objects,” Sophie retorted. “You know what they say; <i>look, don’t glomp</i>. You have LOs too, don’t pretend like you don’t!”<br><br>Theo laid his magazine down across his chest and met Sophie’s gaze with the ire of an irritated Ranger. “<i>My</i> lust objects aren’t <i>your</i> cousins,” he said.<br><br>Sophie paused for a moment, though Theo wasn’t sure if it was from surprise or all the blood that must be in her head by now, judging by how red her face was. Probably the latter. “What?” she said eloquently.<br><br>Of course she was talking again in moments. “Aragorn is your cousin? I didn’t know Arathorn had siblings. Or was it Gilraen?”<br><br>“Second cousin,” Theo said. “My great-grandfather was Gilbarad, father of Ivorwen.<sup>2</sup> Relatives of canons tend to be ‘Sues, and I’m sure you realize the problem with being ‘Sueish in this place. I’m not ashamed of it, but I don’t advertise it. In any event, I’ll thank you to stop telling me how attractive you find my kin.”<br><br>Sophie pulled herself back onto the top bunk and was silent for nearly thirty seconds. Theo took advantage of the time and flipped his magazine up again to keep reading the article about the new Ryzen hard drive. He was thinking of buying one, but not quite convinced yet, despite the glowing review. Still, it wasn’t like he had anything better to do with his money, aside from paying for hobbies.<br><br>Sophie’s voice interrupted his ruminations. “If I can get Upstairs to clear a visit to OFUM, can you get me an autograph?”<br><br><h2>Badfic</h2>
<br><a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12834406/1/The-Chaos-In-Stars"><a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12834406/1/The-Chaos-In-Stars">https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12834406/1/The-Chaos-In-Stars</a></a><br><br>Let me quote our good friend Larfen on this one:<br><br>&quot;tony stark&#39;s serial killer sister named artemis with dark black eyes like a goldfish&quot;<br><br>I mean, it’s not the worst ‘Sue I’ve ever seen, but there’s so much to riff off of, such as her hamhanded description of her own eyes, which have black irises most of the time; or the fact that her code name is AS09, which sounds just like “asinine” if you say it fast enough. It’ll be an amusing and fairly standard mission, which will be good to introduce my agents and establish their dynamic.<br><br>___________<br><br><sup>1</sup> The fanfic in question is a fanfic I wrote when I was a kid. It was pretty terrible, but Theo was a decent, well-rounded character despite his dumb name. He deserved better.<br><br><sup>2</sup> It’s not inherently bad to have a character related to a canon, so I think this is something FicPsych would have left alone while resetting his memory. I didn’t include it in his bio because I doubt it will ever come up in general missions and suchlike. But I couldn’t resist the opportunity to use it for comedy, especially since Sophie’s LotR LO is Aragorn.<br><br>Also, it’s not the case that all Rangers are closely related to Aragorn, for the record, though 14-year-old me certainly thought so when she made this character up.</p>

            <p>It&#39;s a bit surprising to see the Permission request in the Board post itself rather than in a collection of Google docs, which is what lots of other Boarders have done before, but it doesn&#39;t matter because you&#39;ve got the makings of a great agent team. Nice touch with the re-use of a character from one of your own works that you found to be badly written overall, but with the character in question being still salvageable - something which several of my agents can definitely relate to.<br><br>Best of luck with your first mission, and I look forward to reading your future works! :D</p>

            <p>*starts coughing*<br><br>Okay, let&#39;s take a look here.<br><br>First of all, I enjoyed reading the prompts, genuinely enjoyed it. I smiled the whole way through both of them, and I didn&#39;t notice any SPaG errors jumping out at me. And I saw you screaming at the fic in the chat last night, so you definitely picked a zinger for your first mission. Thumbs up. <br><br>The main question I have pertains to the first prompt. Well, two questions, really. <br><br>Why does Theo fix up cars in his RC? Who does he repair them for? Other agents in HQ won&#39;t exactly have a need for them, and if he&#39;s giving DoSAT a hand in his free time, I&#39;d imagine he would just go to their workshops where there&#39;s more room.<br><br>What&#39;s the sudden reference to <i>Doctor Who</i> supposed to be for? I keep rereading that bit trying to figure out if the car Theo is fixing is supposed to be the &quot;bigger on the bottom&quot; TARDIS or not, or if he brings it up for some other equally unexplained reason.<br><br>When you see this I&#39;d love to hear some explanations for the above two questions, but otherwise, I&#39;m going to say <b>Permission granted.</b><br><br>*sticks a party hat on your head*</p>

            <p>Now that you mention it, I guess those bits were a little confusing. I was thinking Theo was fixing cars for people outside of HQ, mostly in New Caledonia. I was thinking it would be a kind of &quot;Hey, I know a guy who can do that for half the price the shop charges&quot; arrangement. I knew a guy in college who did that for people in the town, and that&#39;s where I got the idea. But I definitely should have specified that.<br><br>And the &quot;bigger on the bottom&quot; thing is the RC itself. Some years ago I read a Doctor Who fanfic where a TARDIS&#39;s chameleon circuit was credited for making the TARDIS &quot;bigger on the bottom&quot;, presumably instead of bigger on the inside. The implication I was shooting for is that Theo missioned that fic (or one with the same mistake -- no idea how common it is) and stole the chameleon circuit, then applied it to his RC. I&#39;ll edit the story to make that clearer.<br><br>Anyhow, thank you very much! I&#39;m glad you liked my prompts, and, of course, thanks for Permission!<br><br>*Accepts party hat, proffers lozenge*</p>
