            <p>Hey, folks! I&#39;ve just added a few things to my <a href="https://www.cardcastgame.com/browse/deck/P3BP7">Neshomeh&#39;s Archive</a> CAHQ deck, plus &quot;the warsheep&quot; to the <a href="https://www.cardcastgame.com/browse/deck/99T32">More Cards Against Headquarters</a> deck, and I thought it might be a good time to ask for any suggestions you might have, too. It&#39;s been a while, and I know there are card-worthy things I haven&#39;t got yet. Calls are always especially needed, since they&#39;re harder to come up with.<br><br>For reference, my decks (in addition to the ones linked above) are these:<br><br>- <a href="https://www.cardcastgame.com/browse/deck/VB33K">FicPsych</a><br>- <a href="https://www.cardcastgame.com/browse/deck/AJH5Q">The Inevitable Holiday Edition</a> (note: winter holidays only; other holidays might need their own deck?)<br>- <a href="https://www.cardcastgame.com/browse/deck/RJUHV">The Flowers: A</a> (the 30 most popular ones; responses only)<br>- <a href="https://www.cardcastgame.com/browse/deck/H7ZUB">The Flowers: B</a> (all the rest; responses only)<br><br>So, if you have ideas, tell me! I&#39;ll add pretty much anything to the More Cards Against Headquarters deck, though I might tweak the grammar to make sure it functions properly and with maximum potential for lulz.<br><br>The only suggestions I definitely <b>won&#39;t</b> use are those involving Boarders; there&#39;s a separate deck for that, and it&#39;s Mattman&#39;s, not mine.<br><br>Feel free to suggest stuff from your own missions, but please <i>don&#39;t</i> suggest your own characters&#39; names as responses. Names, by and large, are pretty boring, so it just doesn&#39;t make sense to add them unless it&#39;s by popular demand. (Humorous descriptions, e.g. &quot;a flake with a camera,&quot; are another matter. Go nuts with humorous descriptions.)<br><br>By the same token, fandom references are good, but it&#39;s best if they&#39;re funny in their own right, so everyone can enjoy them even if they&#39;re not in that fandom. Anyway, there&#39;s probably a deck for your fandom out there already.<br><br>With those guidelines in mind, go wild!<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>I manifestly do not have the resources to go to school. Even if I did, school is NOT what I&#39;d use them for. I&#39;m no gambler; I don&#39;t want to give some institution my money if I&#39;m not absolutely 100% certain that it&#39;ll pay off.<br><br>Which I&#39;m not, because a lot of college graduates still work as baristas or waiters or retail associates, which is nowhere near enough to stave off debt from student loans.<br><br>The only places I have experience with are the only things I qualify for. But... my experience in fast food was a nightmare, and after being let go from Walmart, I&#39;d spend every day of retail in constant fear that my bosses are just itching for an excuse to kick me out; bad experiences tend to color my opinion of general groups, unfortunately.

            <p>Chain retail places don&#39;t want to keep anybody around so long that they get promoted into earning benefits or a living wage, heaven forbid, and Wal-Mart has a reputation for not treating its employees very well on balance. I&#39;d say you were well shut of it, but I know how much job-hunting sucks, and I&#39;m sorry. It makes everyone feel like scum.<br><br>Try a Starbucks, if you&#39;ve got one. (They&#39;re almost everywhere, but I don&#39;t know where you are, so I&#39;unno.) The CEO actually believes in using his power for good, and helping store employees go to school and stuff.<br><br>... I was gonna say something in my signature, but it got too long, so: A few years ago, I wanted to work at Teavana, or Adagio Teas, or Argo Tea, because those were cruddy retail jobs I thought I could actually get into. I love tea. But somehow, despite having all the enthusiasm in the world and being an intelligent, educated, fairly personable individual, I couldn&#39;t convince any of them to take me. Now, thanks to a rec from a church choir friend, I&#39;m the receptionist at a small acupuncture clinic in one of the nice suburbs. I&#39;m not getting paid a ton, but it&#39;s a great place to be, the people are awesome, getting there is easier than getting to the technically-closer pizza place I was at before, and it&#39;s opened up other opportunities, too.<br><br>(And if I have time, I make tea when I get in, and offer it to the clients. They usually want their own thing, though, rather than whatever I&#39;ve got in the kettle. Sigh.)<br><br>Life isn&#39;t fair. This is a good thing. Yeah, it means you have to work hard for the good stuff, but it also means you probably don&#39;t deserve the crap that happens to you, and you never know when you might luck into something you never imagined.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>It&#39;s pretty obvious, though, that after the end of the Eighth Wars they didn&#39;t have all that much confidence in the show. The Ninth Wars was barely advertised at all, and the Tenth Wars - for all that it was the best damn series yet - was obliterated in the ratings... <i><b>BY THE BBC</b></i>. It got even less advertising than the Ninth Wars and was shoved in the same timeslot as Blue Planet II. Someone at the BBC had evidently completely lost confidence in the show.<br><br>I am angry and upset. Robot Wars had the best format of all the currently-existing robot combat shows and the downtime between fights was spent in the pits with the roboteers. At least King of Bots was good and Battlebots is getting a third reboot series.</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve actually been playing World of Warcraft for six years but I&#39;ve only just started caring about the lore in the last few months so its funny that you&#39;re getting into WoW too?<br><br>I also watched Dune for the very first time a few months ago and now I&#39;ve been reading the books -- not quite ready to dip into those fandom-waters but I have a few close friends who are really into it too so I&#39;m on my way. And for the first time I&#39;m putting real effort into watching Star Trek Next Gen because I&#39;m on my second re-watch of DS9 and know that I should probably watch both.</p>
