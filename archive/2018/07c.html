            <p>After... I think about a month wherein Aegis came over to my house nearly every day, he and my mom (with a little help from me) finally finished sewing his Tenth Doctor costume.<br><br>And, because I wanted to match, I put together a Jack Harkness costume. None of mine was homemade, sorry to say, but no Doctor is complete without a companion, am I right?<br><br>Check out the gallery from our photo shoot <a href="https://imgur.com/a/qUo3S2L">here!</a> Special thanks to my mom for photographing us... and working her butt off to get that suit made.</p>

            <p>It&#39;s been a while since I&#39;ve watched Doctor Who, but I know that it&#39;s hard to make a costume look like actual clothes. I&#39;ve spent much fruitless time trying to figure out what makes the &quot;patina of the real.&quot; Maybe I should eat more fruit.</p>

            <p>((Ten years hence [or fifteen, or who knows how many?], when Ix and Charlotte are long retired from the PPC. Filled for prompt 2.))<br><br><br>Faolan slowly circled the young woman, pincushion in hand and a rather large collection of pins in her mouth. <br><br>&quot;Hem looks even,&quot; she mumbled around the pins. &quot;Alright, you want to go ahead and get dressed? I can finish this up for you tonight and you can come pick it up in the morning.&quot;<br><br>Maggie beamed and stepped off the footstool, twirling a little bit in her Cinderella ballgown. &quot;Seriously, I can&#39;t thank you enough; you can work magic.&quot;<br><br>Faolan smiled and ducked her head, pulling pins out of her mouth and sticking them in the pincushion. &quot;Something like that,&quot; she said as Maggie disappeared behind the changing screen.<br><br>Charlotte wandered in with her clipboard, tapping Faolan on the shoulder. &quot;Just got another call,&quot; she said, passing the clipboard over. &quot;We&#39;ve got a couple who want to do Link and Zelda,&quot; she said. &quot;<i>Twilight Princess</i> specifically—I put them down for Monday at eleven.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Sounds good to me,&quot; Faolan said, leaning in briefly to rest her forehead against Charlotte&#39;s. <br><br>Charlotte smiled and kissed her briefly before pulling away. &quot;I&#39;m going to pop to the store,&quot; she said. &quot;We&#39;re running low on sandwich bread.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Bring me some of those little chocolate pastries?&quot; Faolan asked, and Charlotte grinned.<br><br>&quot;You got it,&quot; she said, disappearing out the door.<br><br>Maggie came around the screen, dressed again in her jeans and T-shirt with the gown draped over her arm. &quot;So how long have you been doing the cosplay business?&quot; she asked curiously. &quot;It seems like an awful lot of work for just two people.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Just a few years,&quot; Faolan said, passing Maggie a water bottle in exchange for the gown. She draped it over a dress form, smoothing out the skirts carefully. &quot;We&#39;ve kind of got it down to a system now.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Good system,&quot; Maggie remarked, sitting on a nearby chair. She took a long gulp from her water bottle—it was starting to get warm in the fitting room, despite Faolan&#39;s best efforts at setting up fans—before shifting uncomfortably. &quot;Can I ask you something... a little personal?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Is it about my face?&quot; Faolan asked dryly, and Maggie&#39;s cheeks went pink.<br><br>&quot;Well... actually, yeah,&quot; she said. &quot;Do you mind me asking... how you got those scars?&quot;<br><br>Faolan&#39;s voice was dry enough to match her smile. &quot;I was mauled by a werewolf as a little kid,&quot; she said.<br><br>Maggie laughed. &quot;Okay, no, seriously.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Car accident,&quot; Faolan said automatically, and Maggie winced in sympathy. <br><br>&quot;Tough luck. Nobody was...?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Killed? No, Ma and Da didn&#39;t even get hurt. Just me.&quot;<br><br>Maggie nodded, fingers tapping on her water bottle. &quot;That&#39;s something, at least. The scars <i>do</i> look pretty badass, though,&quot; she added. &quot;Though I like your werewolf story a lot better. That&#39;s pretty funny.&quot;<br><br>Faolan glanced down at her wrists, at the shiny pink scars that wrapped around them—the result of pulling on her chains once a month for nearly fifteen years.<br><br>&quot;Yeah,&quot; she said, looking up at Maggie. &quot;Certainly a lot more entertaining story to tell, at least. Is there anything else you wanted before you go? Shoes? I can do slippers to your size if you need them.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Nah, I&#39;ve already got a pair,&quot; Maggie said, grabbing her coat and slipping it on. &quot;Thank you so much!

            <p>&quot;Now, <i>staaay.</i>&quot;<br><br>&quot;Omanyte!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Hahah! No, no, <i>you</i> stay. Go on, girl, <i>staaay?</i>&quot;<br><br>&quot;O-man-YTE!&quot;<br><br>&quot;<i>Good</i> girl!&quot;<br><br>It was dark in the RC, and for the moment Peri preferred it that way - it was better than having to watch Nautilus overplay the caretaker role.<br><br>Just listening to the cooing was bad enough, given his headache.<br><br><small>&quot;<i>Some</i> of us are still <i>recovering</i>. Can you please keep it down?</small>&quot; He hissed, trying not to add to his own pain.<br><br>&quot;Oh! Sorry, Peri.&quot; The other man amended - given his color and height, it was hard to pick him out at the other end of the darkened RC, so he was stuck working from voice alone. Nautilus had lowered his volume, but it still felt like it wasn&#39;t enough.<br><br><small>&quot;Now, see if you like eating this...&quot;</small> There was a pause.<br><br>&quot;PLEH!&quot; Something small and oddly shiny in the minimal lighting flew all the way across the response center - on Peri&#39;s arms.<br><br><i>&quot;Gah!&quot;</i> he reacted, flinching, and the unsteadiness of the world around him suddenly grew <i>worse</i>. Quickly moving the pillow he was resting on to being on <i>top</i> of him, he closed his eyes and tried to focus on breathing.<br><br>It was supposed to have been a normal mission in the Pokémon continuum - a whole host of minis and other typos, a main character who was both barely a rounded personality <i>and</i> a textbook Black Hole Sue, and at one point an inexplicable <i>My Little Pony cameo.</i><br><br>If Nautilus had wanted a pet, he should have kept one of the minis - but instead, they&#39;d found an Omanyte, and the other agent refused to pass up the second-degree pun.<br><br>Back in the present, Peri removed the pillow once he felt like he&#39;d regained some control - a sign that it was okay for Nautilus to approach, now.<br><br><small>&quot;Sorry about all of that,&quot;</small> he said quietly, as Peri peeled the rejected - seaweed? <i>Really?</i> - off his own dark skin.<br><br><small>&quot;Probably should keep him in the bathroom or something...&quot;</small><br><br><small>&quot;<i>If</i> you&#39;re going to keep him, we&#39;d need to fit an aquarium in here,&quot;</small> Peri retorted.<br><br>&quot;I&#39;m not saying you can&#39;t keep him, just- I&#39;ve heard stories.&quot;<br><br>Nautilus shrugged, grinning wryly.<br><br>&quot;Hey, if it better reflects his natural habitat..&quot;<br><br>&quot;Have you even named her?&quot; Peri sat all the way up now, looking over with suspicion.<br><br>&quot;I was thinking it&#39;d have to be a word we don&#39;t use normally, so - Curlicue?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Omanyte!&quot;<br><br>Peri hit Nautilus with the pillow.</p>

            <p>Since you’ve commented on my last three prompts, it’s about time I returned the favour.<br><br>I really enjoyed this - I like the small font for whispering (not something I’d use myself, as my HTML isn’t great!)<br><br>I don’t know the agents or fandoms, so I’m not really sure what an Omanyte actually is, but it’s still amusing.<br><br>And yeah, prompt two probably was a little easy.

            <p>Neither of the agents are from Pokemon, but that&#39;s where the <a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Omanyte_(Pok%C3%A9mon)">Omanyte</a> is! Nautilus is a semi-fic blip in a MAJOR way, while Peri is the result of a (hypothetical so far) <i>Young Wizards</i> mission with an <i>in-fic exorcised</i> Power!Sue. (No, Peri&#39;s not the Sue; he just internalized a LOT of glitter during the process. Detoxifying him was... a trial.)<br><br>And the HTML markers are fairly simple - as long as you remember to close them, they&#39;ll work! The one I use for the whispering is &lt; small &gt; &lt; /small &gt; (spaces added so you can see the format, of course!) Other possibilities include italics (&lt; i &gt; &lt; /i &gt;), bold (&lt; b &gt; &lt; /b &gt;), and strikethrough (&lt; strike &gt; &lt; /strike &gt;).</p>

            <p><br>Rosie smiled. She was finally going to where she wanted to be. Maybe she could finally find Kiera again.<br><br>“Tell me,” said Clara, “why do you want to do this?”<br><br>Rosie shrugged. “You know why. It’s where I grew up. We have to do something!”<br><br>“There’s something more than that, isn’t there?”<br><br>Rosie quite often thought that Clara was far too perceptive. This was definitely one of those times.<br><br>“Maybe…” she said slowly. “What makes you think that?”<br><br><br>“Well, since you arrived you’ve been going on about it, all the time, for five years. There’s got to be something more, because from what I’ve heard it wasn’t exactly the best place ever.”<br><br>Rosie was silent.<br><br>“Come on! Spit it out!”<br><br>“Fine,” said Rosie sharply, trying to work out how best to phrase this. “The day before I arrived, I went to see this play with some friends. Thing is, it was technically illegal, and…” She tried not to think of Imogen. That memory was too painful. “There was a raid, and the government came, and my friend… her name was Kiera – her name <i>is</i> Kiera.”<br><br>Kiera wasn’t dead. At least, Rosie didn’t think she was, and she was determined not to.<br><br>“She… she wanted to help us escape… so she got herself caught instead. I’ve been feeling bad ever since.” Now she had begun, she might as well reveal the whole thing. “The person who told the government… was my other friend. Imogen.”<br><br>Clara nodded. “And now you want to save your friend?”<br><br>“If she’s still… still around to be saved. It’s been five years, but I’ve got to try. I know she would have done the same for me.”<br><br><br><br><br>Note: if you read my prompt from a month ago, then yes, this is the same Clara.</p>

            <p>For the younger folks unaware, there was a TV show back in the 1980s called <i>St. Elsewhere</i>.  There was a little boy on the show, and in the very last scene of the very last episode, a pan-out on the (hospital, I think?) was suddenly shaken around, and we learn that the entire series had taken place inside a snow globe belonging to the <i>real</i> version of that boy, who had autism, and all the characters and events of that show were things he imagined while looking at it.<br><br>But TV executives like crossovers as much as we fanfic writers do, and thanks to actors guest starring across other shows, a whole lot of television series are connected to <i>St. Elsewhere</i>, which means they are also part of that autism-powered snow globe dream.  There&#39;s a <a href="https://thetommywestphall.wordpress.com/the-master-list/">list</a> current as of 2016, where we find that the PPC is also part of that boy&#39;s dream, thanks to our forays into the Buffyverse, <i>Battlestar Galactica</i>, <i>CSI</i>, the Whoniverse, <i>Firefly</i>, <i>General Hospital</i>, <i>Heroes</i>, <i>M*A*S*H</i>, <i>NCIS</i>, <i>Star Trek</i>, <i>Stargate</i>, <i>Supernatural</i>, <i>Warehouse 13</i>, and <i>The X-Files</i>.<br><br>So: does that mean all the other universes the PPC has entered are also part of the snow globe dream?  And since so many recruits come from World One . . .<br><br>—doctorlit, intentionally ridiculous</p>

            <p>Back when Knut ruled England, Denmark, Norway and Sweden, that is.<br><br>Viking dynasties ended up ruling a lot of places, but mostly the major rulers broke up their holdings among their sons. What of they hadn&#39;t? If Svein or (more likely) Harold had maintained the North Sea Empire, could they have conquered or brought in the other Viking lands of Ireland and Normandy? It doesn&#39;t seem too unlikely.<br><br>Then you have the line of three: Iceland to Greenland to Vinland. Is a trade war too modern an idea? If the Iceland route was an alliance (which it would be; they all have to pass through each other to get anywhere!) and decided it no longer wanted to supply Vinland goods to the Empire, might the Empire simply up and invade? Again, it&#39;s perfectly possible.<br><br>... there must be a book which does this, right?<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>So I&#39;ve been bingewatching <a href="http://localhost:3000/posts/scrape/2018/systemswe.love">Systems We Love</a> (this link probably won&#39;t be of interest to you if you&#39;re not technical, sorry). Not all of then are winners: computer people aren&#39;t always the most amazing speakers (but speaking of computer people who <i>are</i> amazing speakers, everyone, even the nontechnical types, should go watch <a href="https://vimeo.com/146524997">this</a>. I have never laughed so hard at an ostensibly technical talk. This has nothing to do with the rest of this discussion, I just think this talk is really funny).<br><br>Anyways, inspired by that, I&#39;m making this thread for everyone to post about something they love. Something that makes them really passionate. Share it, explain to us why you love it. Really make us <i>feel</i> the love (not like that. No. Stop. Ewww).<br><br>I&#39;ll post a response myself once I&#39;m not on my phone.</p>

            <p>Greetings, people/animals/potted plants/sentient hydrogen molecules of PPC. This is going to be my first post on The Board, and I&#39;ll be looking forward to joining this community. I initially heard of the PPC through TVTropes (oddly enough), and I lurked on the PPC wiki for a while before deciding to make an introductory post here. I have Asperger&#39;s Syndrome, a mild form of Autism, so I&#39;m usually really bad at social interaction.<br><br>I&#39;m in a lot of fandoms (and I mean <i>a lot</i> of fandoms), but the ones I&#39;m mainly involved in at the current time are the SCP Foundation, Nintendo, and Jojo&#39;s Bizarre Adventure. Keep in mind that my interests change over time, and my involvement with the fandom of any piece of media is directly proportional to my interest in said media at the time.<br><br>I also have a tendency to spout out meaningless and stupid memes. <i>Lots and lots of memes.</i></p>

            <p>Hey there! I&#39;m Twistey, a 1-year-bie who also has Asperger&#39;s and can&#39;t stop cranking out ideas. Just, just imagine me as a thumbs up sticking out of a huge pile of ideas. X&#39;D I also have a lot of fandoms, currently exploring what I call the Holy Duality (which is Wolfenstein 3D and Lichtspeer) as well as delving into the world of bad Doom wads.<br><br>So, what do you intend to do here? What kinds of badfic do you wish to spork, and using what methods? Do you have any agent ideas? I&#39;m pretty good at reviewing character bios and other short overviews like that, so I can help if you wish! :D<br><br>Now, for your newbie gift. Let&#39;s see. How about this cool sword made of stained glass pieces fused together? It has no special powers, but it&#39;s made from a stained glass window that I broke in a fit of rage. *holds up bandaged hand* See? (It&#39;s a long story.)<br><br>Anyway, it&#39;s nice to meet you. I hope you have a great time here! Welcome to the PPC!<br><br>-Twistey</p>

            <p>Thanks for the introduction! It&#39;s refreshing to see another Aspie on the internet.<br><br>My agent will be a cartoonish representation of me, but with a stand (don&#39;t question it). I&#39;m mainly planning on sporking badslash fics, so I guess he&#39;ll be an exorcist. I can show you what I have in mind once I get permission to start sporking, so please be a patient pickle until then. <br><br>Also, thanks for the gift.

            <p>Hello, and welcome aBoard! For your newbie gift, take this plate of freshly-made SPaGhetti!<br><br>If you haven&#39;t yet read them, may I point you towards <a href="http://plotprotectors.tripod.com/TOS/">the Original Series</a> and <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=18hztHpDehxcfrjaXoFUew1vb0BdZPDAusHxMHzHiCzM">the Constitution</a>? They&#39;re pretty much the only required reading around these parts. Another useful resource you might use is <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/PPC_Wiki&lt;br%20/&gt;">the Wiki</a>; if you have any questions, just look here before asking. We like it when newbies do the research. ;)<br><br>And don&#39;t feel weird about finding the PPC through TV Tropes! That&#39;s how a lot of newbies these days are finding us—heck, that&#39;s how I found it, four and... *checks calendar* a half years ago? Yikes, how time flies.<br><br>Hope you decide to stick around!</p>

            <p>Fairly certain that that fandom&#39;s been a little underrepresented here compared to how large it is. I know of exactly one mission in that &#39;verse, which is over <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/11u6eQ2Xdm_NqgG8utKlpCrzpgg0ZJ75TTyZ3xH4Sggo/edit">here</a> if you haven&#39;t read it.

I&#39;ve currently got four spinoffs with published content (the Galeforces mission is from the first one I came up with) if you wanna check thosse out, and other people I&#39;d recommend are Herr Wozzeck&#39;s Florestan and Eusabius and Voyd&#39;s Valon and Kala (though the latter is no longer active, they had a good run while they were still here).<br><br>Have one of my own shed feathers and a complimentary kit of Spikes!</p>

            <p>(Pun totally not intended.)<br><br>Some missions take whole <i>decades</i> to finish writing - whether or not the badfic is complete, or gets completed over the course of mission-writing - or even if the whole fic <i>gets</i> missioned, if the agents can gather a minimum amount of charges.<br><br>So, it&#39;s no big deal what you set as your first fic. ^^</p>

            <p>Welcome, Skater! I&#39;m Twistey, a one-year-bie who has too many ideas and loves cheese. I&#39;ll be on here pretty much daily until the end of summer, so if you have anything to ask me, I&#39;ll be happy to answer. I kinda specialize in analyzing character bios and other short, overarching-idea things, so I&#39;d love to hear any agent ideas you have!<br><br>So, what other fandoms are you a part of? Do you have any original works? What do you plan to do here? I&#39;d love to hear more about you!<br><br>And for your newbie present? I haven&#39;t given any of these items out in a while, so here&#39;s a bundle of Wolfenstein 3D-related stuff: a replica Spear of Destiny, a Very Flat Flamethrower, a replica &quot;Call Apogee Say &#39;Aardwolf&#39;&quot; sign, a few blue bricks, some shiny blue metal, and what used to be a stained glass window. Why so many things, you ask? I highly encourage you to combine them into something. Be creative! Make something for your virtual self or for your agents. :D<br><br>Anyway, nice to meet you! I hope you have a great time here, and welcome to the PPC!<br><br>-Twistey</p>

            <p>Hello, and welcome aBoard! For your newbie gift, take this plate of freshly-made SPaGhetti!<br><br>Since you already know about the Wiki and the Original Series, I&#39;ll just point you to  <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=18hztHpDehxcfrjaXoFUew1vb0BdZPDAusHxMHzHiCzM">the Constitution</a>. :) <br><br>As for writing on the Wiki, we don&#39;t put pages for different continua unless there&#39;s been a mission or two done there. Not really much sense in trying to catalogue every work of fiction when you really only need references to the ones you might come across while reading missions, yeah?<br><br>If you see pages that are in need of expanding, though, feel free to fill them out. The only thing off-limits, really, are other people&#39;s agent pages.<br><br>(Also, if you want some awesome spinoffs to read: Neshomeh&#39;s stuff is my favorite.

            <p>One entry...<br><br>Video Games: Persona Series.<br><br>...And I&#39;m cheating. Atlus make excellent JRPGs, with a difficulty you just don&#39;t see as often today, bewitching plot, killer soundtracks, and come on, characters fighting with the power of Character Development has to count for something. <br><br>The two first entries are more like classical RPGs, while the later ones follow the protagonist along a school year, meaning time management for several factors, most important being proper bonding with the rest of the cast, taking place along the usual dungeon crawling and bosses fights, who went through several mutations at the occasion. <br><br>Titles are all across the PS line, although I recommend taking later versions of the games if you want to test them: the fact Atlus tries for constant improvement means older versions don&#39;t age so well when several comfort features of the later games aren&#39;t there. <br><br>Most recent entry is Persona 5 on PS4 and 3, and I think this one gets to be JRPG of the Decade. Just try this series people.</p>

            <p>Well, I&#39;ve got a real juicy game to show you- <b>Eternal Card Game,</b> by Dire Wolf Digital, the same minds that brought you Pokemon Trading Card Game Online and The Elder Scrolls: Legends. <br><br>It&#39;s a digital TCG that has all of the polish of Hearthstone, but all of the mechanical intricacy of Magic- which it <i>should</i> have, since the dev team includes Magic pros like Luis Scott-Vargas and Patrick Chapin. Needless to say, they know what they&#39;re doing. And it&#39;s also generous (the game gives you tons and tons of cards just for playing the game, so if you&#39;re fine with grinding, you don&#39;t have to pay a cent)!<br><br>Plus, it&#39;s not lacking in the story department, either, with four campaigns to play through so far and tons of lore to dig into!<br><br>So, with that all out of the way to perhaps get you hooked, I have some links to share with you:<br><br>First off, the link to the <i>normal</i> website for the game is over <a href="https://www.direwolfdigital.com/eternal/">here.</a><br><br>However, if you can bear with me for a moment... one of the things this game offers so you can get more free in-game stuff (ranging from packs, to premium cards, to special exclusive avatars) is an invite system- the one who gives the invite gets free stuff, and the invitee gets free stuff, too! So, here&#39;s my <a href="https://www.direwolfdigital.com/eternal/register/?ref=49171f72-94fc-4727-acd1-dbcb71b179a6">invite link</a> for if you&#39;re interested in that deal. (If you&#39;re not, but you&#39;re still interested in the game itself, there&#39;s still the first link.)<br><br>And finally, no TCG is complete without Johnnies brewing rogue decks, and one of the flagship Johnnies of Eternal is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/LocoPojo">LocoPojo</a>, the mastermind behind plenty of the crazy jank in this game- ranging from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oPIoJTUInk">insane ramp decks</a>, to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7utXuVDuvfo">hilarious surprise Piercing Grief rushes</a>. Even when I&#39;m not playing the game myself, this guy&#39;s videos and <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/locopojo">Twitch streams</a> are just too fun to watch.</p>

            <p>Or: So, I only found out about <i>Young Wizards</i> because I was on the Sentient Vehicles page on TvTropes to read more about Siddeley, saw the mention of sentient taxi cabs in SYWTBAW and thought &quot;Hmm... I&#39;ll check it out.&quot;<br><br>That was 2011. Over the course of a year, I proceeded to check out all of the books available by that date (the old print versions, of course). The idea of being able to talk to <i>anything</i> really appealed to me, especially when it came to abstract beings and inanimate objects. =P<br><br>2012, I found the fandom on tumblr (because someone had registered the peridexis URL at the time - I think a spambot has it now, though), and everything sort of exploded. Through <i>Young Wizards</i>, I put more value into empathy, friendships, and Psychology.<br><br>You can say it made me who I am. :V <br><br>So, check out the books <a href="http://localhost:3000/posts/scrape/2018/ebooksdirect.com">online</a>, and maybe you&#39;ll learn something new about the world around you too, not just another realm of fiction.</p>

            <p>Do I have plugs? Oh boy...<br><br>Okay, so, in no particular order:<br><br>Pern - Did you love late Discworld? Are you tired of grimdark nonsense crowding up your shelf, and do you really just want to read some classically optimistic Sci-Fi/Fantasy? Do you want to read something that is just straight up weird and a bit outside your traditional Sci-Fi/Fantasy? Pick up Pern. It&#39;s fantastic and amazing. In particular, pick up the Harper Hall trilogy, and then The White Dragon. Those books are perhaps the most beloved of the Pern series, and they&#39;re also just... fantastic. Especially Harper Hall. This is a book about people who love music written by someone who clearly shares that love, and wow does it show. Unfortunately, you have to read Dragonflight and Dragonquest first, which... aren&#39;t as good? Okay, Dragonquest is pretty good, but Dragonflight is... not. At least, not at first. By the end, it&#39;s excellent, but the beginning is weak, if not actually bad, and you can tell it&#39;s some of McCaffrey&#39;s earliest work. There are also issues with... okay, I&#39;m not doing any of my rants right now. Not even the Dragonseye rant that&#39;s actually about Pern being awesome. Another time.<br><br>Discworld - okay, I mentioned late Discworld above, so... right. Excuse me for a moment...<br><br><i>Grabs Megaphone</i><br><br><b>IF YOU HAVE NOT YET AT LEAST ATTEMPTED TO GO READ DISCWORLD, YOU SHOULD GO READ DISCWORLD.</b><br><br>Sorry, but I had to make that eminently clear. If that&#39;s all you need, pick one of <i>Guards! Guards!</i>, <i>Wyrd Sisters</i>, <i>Mort</i>, or <i>Going Postal</i> to start with (or any number of others, but those are the classic starting points. Go. Now, really! I mean it!<br><br>It&#39;s sort of hard to understate Discworld&#39;s influence. The series is utterly brilliant, and Pratchett has inspired more people than I can count. Also, he&#39;s a direct influence on us. As in, the PPC. Pratchett&#39;s in the blood of this place, and that&#39;s reason enough to read him. And on top of that... I mean, I said utterly brilliant, I&#39;m not sure that&#39;s even enough. It&#39;s smart, funny, poignant, and just a delight in every sense of the word. I&#39;m sorry if I&#39;m going on a bit, but it&#39;s just that good.<br><br>Amon Amarth - Not a book, but a band. If you like Metal, Amon Amarth does viking metal. It&#39;s kinda cheesy. It&#39;s also sorta awesome.<br><br>Doom (1993) - In my opinion, both the first id Software game and the first FPS that stands the test of time. Sorry Twisty. Go grab a copy of GZDoom so you can rebind the keyboard controls to something sane if you want to play it now, but the fact that that&#39;s all it takes to make the game feel pretty much modern is impressive, especially compared to its forebears, and even to some of its contemporaries (lookin&#39; at you, System Shock).<br><br>By the way, I have a fully-working Apple IIgs at home, and that was the system that id&#39;s very earliest games ran on, before they even WERE id Software. So when my data transfer cables and such come in, I intend to try a hand a reviewing some of those.<br><br>NetHack - The DevTeam thinks of everything. NetHack is the oldest roguelike still in active development. Depending on how you count it, Nethack either begin development in 1981 (one year after Rogue&#39;s release), or in 1987. Either way, it&#39;s old, deep, complicated, and extremely absorbing. Also really really really hard. But still, if you want to get a feel for what a real Roguelike is like, this is the game to try. Well, this or Angband, being as they are the primary endpoints of the two oldest branches of the Roguelike family tree. Plus, both games are totally free.<br><br>The Zachtronics Game - For while it comes in many incarnations, there is only one Zachtronics game. If you like puzzles, get one (probably SpaceChem or Opus Magnum). If you&#39;re a programmer... ho boy. Zachtronics game us basically crack for programmers.<br><br>Homestuck...&#39;s Soundtrack - Don&#39;t read Homestuck. Really, don&#39;t. Sure, it&#39;s alright, but it&#39;s not worth the investment it&#39;ll take. Especially after Act 5 Part 2, at which point what little degree of good pacing the comic had up to that point goes to hell and the whole thing ends with the most anticlimactic final battle I&#39;ve ever seen.<br><br>But if there&#39;s one thing that is actually completely great about Homestuck, no compromises or asterisks, it&#39;s the soundtrack. &quot;Sburban Jungle.&quot; &quot;Explore.&quot; &quot;Descend.&quot; &quot;Savior of the Waking World.&quot; All of &quot;Cascade.&quot; &quot;Black.&quot; &quot;Midnight Crew (Acapella).&quot; &quot;Unite/Synchronization.&quot; And that&#39;s just off the top of my head. It&#39;s one of the best soundtracks I&#39;ve ever heard, and I&#39;ve heard some pretty bangin&#39; soundracks.<br><br>The Irresponsible Captain Tylor - It wouldn&#39;t be a Thoth recommendation list without SOMETHING obscure. So here you go. a mid-90s anime that parodies Space Operas and just... oh my god this show is funny. I&#39;m not even kidding. It&#39;s one of the funniest things I&#39;ve seen. Seriously, go watch it.<br><br>The Hitchhiker&#39;s Guide to the Galaxy - I&#39;m not sure I have to post this one, but just in case... Well, it&#39;s H2G2. It&#39;s brilliant. Douglas Adams is a comic genius, and so long as you don&#39;t watch the awful movie, it really shows here. If you don&#39;t know what H2G2 is, I&#39;ll be glad to explain, but only if someone asks. I&#39;m really assuming everyone knows and just putting this here to hedge my bets.<br><br>Snow Crash - if Cyberpunk is the house Neuromancer built, than Snow Crash did a lot of work on the house afterwards. This is one of the foundational texts of Cyberpunk and Post-Cyberpunk, and it&#39;s a heck of a lot more readable than Neuromancer. And more fun. And more technologically accurate. And just... it&#39;s good, okay? Well, good if you like Stephenson. You&#39;ll see what I mean if you read it.<br><br>2112 - Rush&#39;s Magnum Opus, 2112 is a great album start to finish, and is absolutely required listening for anyone who likes prog rock. Or anyone else for that matter. How many albums have their entire first half dedicated to seven-part rock opera detailing a story set in the distant sci-fi future? It&#39;s awesome!<br><br>1974 - Now&#39;s my chance to plug someone REALLY obscure. <a href="http://1974online.com">1974</a> (not to be confused with The 1974) is a local band. As in, local to my state. I stumbled across them selling their albums in a tiny booth at a Con, shrugged, said, &quot;what they hell, I like Prog Rock,&quot; and bought a copy of &quot;1974 &amp; The Death of The Herald,&quot; which the band recommended as the first one to pick up.<br><br>And that was arguably the best purchase I made at that con. We&#39;ll get to the other thing I bought fighting for that title next on this list, but I have listened to that album waaay too many times. It&#39;s stupidly good. Better than anything by just some random local band has any right to be. And it&#39;s another prog-rock sci-fi rock opera! (man, I love those things)... I think it&#39;s about... human clones revolting? Or not? And there&#39;s a galactic war that ended? Maybe? It&#39;s... really confusing. I&#39;ll have to ask the band when I see them again.<br><br><a href="http://www.atomic-robo.com/atomicrobo/archive">Atomic Robo</a> - This is a comic book series about a sentient robot powered by nuclear power created by Nicola Tesla in the 1930s, that takes place all over time and space following Robo on his adventures. It also includes the line &quot;When you return to you unobservable but empirically determined dimension of origin... tell them Carl Sagan sent you.&quot; (in The Shadow From Beyond Time, a good adventure to start with, and one of the best ones period so far) If that doesn&#39;t sell it, I don&#39;t know what will. It also has a spinoff called &quot;Real Science Adventures&quot;, which shows adventures set in the same universe that don&#39;t involve Robo.<br><br>Did I mention that the writing&#39;s by the guy who did 8-bit Theater? It is. And that&#39;s great. Also, the comic&#39;s philosophy: &quot;No Angst, No Cheesecake, No Reboots, No Filler, The Main Robot Punches A Different Robot (or Maybe a Monster).&quot; That should tell you what sort of fun this comic is. </p>

            <p>Well, I&#39;m going to plug some more obscure indie games that I love, in order to get them spread around.<br><br>Lichtspeer, also known as &quot;the only ancient Germanic future lightning action game you need in 2016&quot;, is a humorous, wave-based action game where the main mechanic is a cool-looking light spear that the player throws at things. It takes place in an &quot;ancient Germanic future&quot; that looks a little bit 80s, full of enemies such as Hipster Ice Giants, Penguin Vikings, and Das Skater Walrus. Now, why are you up against these things? For the glory of the Lichtgods, of course! (And the Lichtgods are bored. That&#39;s the real reason.)<br><br>Watch the trailer, purchase, etc. at <a href="http://lichtspeer.com/"><a href="http://lichtspeer.com/">http://lichtspeer.com/</a></a>! (Warning: Trailer contains flashing lights.)<br><br>I may have discovered Lovers In A Dangerous Spacetime just a few days ago, but man, it&#39;s cool! If you&#39;re into the &quot;cooperate to pilot a spaceship&quot; genre, or if you&#39;re like me and are just addicted to quirky futuristic games with glowing neon colors up against a dark background, this game is for you! This game can be played by up to 4 players working together to rescue stranded animals and fight constellations that have come to life through the power of something called Anti-Love. The more animals you help, the more you get to upgrade your ship to fight those glowing monsters! What&#39;s not to love?<br><br>Learn more here: <a href="http://www.loversinadangerousspacetime.com/"><a href="http://www.loversinadangerousspacetime.com/">http://www.loversinadangerousspacetime.com/</a></a><br><br>*Gasp* I see a pattern here! Can&#39;t get enough of those neon colors on a black background, but maybe rhythm games and (hey, like Undertale) bullet hell are more your thing? What about Just Shapes And Beats? This game can also be played by up to four players, and has a variety of game modes, ranging from Casual Mode, to a Story Mode that&#39;ll surprisingly tug on your heartstrings, to Party Mode, where the game plays itself! It&#39;s all about the music in this game, and thankfully it&#39;s not all dubstep.<br><br>Learn more at <a href="http://www.justshapesandbeats.com/"><a href="http://www.justshapesandbeats.com/">http://www.justshapesandbeats.com/</a></a><br><br>So yeah, these are three good titles with a common aesthetic, ordered (if I have it right) from most obscure to least obscure, as well as from &quot;I love it and I will protect it forever&quot; to &quot;I&#39;d love it more if I could tolerate the cranked-up bass better.&quot; Check &#39;em out. I&#39;ll send more plugs up this way as soon as I evaluate more games.<br><br>-Twistey</p>

            <p>Generally speaking, we don&#39;t make more than one separate thread on the Board in succession if we can help it. The typical result of this is that other more important posts may be pushed off the front page by accident or otherwise obscured when people look through it for the most recent conversations. If you wish to talk about another topic immediately after you&#39;ve made a post, there&#39;s always the option to reply to your previous post with &quot;OT: [other topic you want to discuss]&quot; or something. It&#39;s not that hard, really!<br><br>Anyway, I&#39;d like to give a hand to a game I&#39;ve recently downloaded called Rodeo Stampede, which comes to us from the same publishers who released Crossy Road and has a similar mechanic except much faster paced and more geared towards property management on the side. It&#39;s a quirky and surprisingly addictive endless runner that I&#39;d highly recommend, if only because of SO many visual puns as unlockables and the occasional pop culture reference (and yes, Pop Vulture is indeed a thing in this game XD). They&#39;ve even got dinosaurs in one of the unlockable worlds, and mythical creatures (including DRAGONS) in another!<br><br>Read more about it here: <a href="https://www.player.one/rodeo-stampede-crossy-road-publisher-lassos-fun-twist-endless-runner-games-541949"><a href="https://www.player.one/rodeo-stampede-crossy-road-publisher-lassos-fun-twist-endless-runner-games-541949">https://www.player.one/rodeo-stampede-crossy-road-publisher-lassos-fun-twist-endless-runner-games-541949</a></a></p>

            <p>There’s nothing wrong with making two Board posts in quick succession, Skarm. Posting multiple thrreads of the same topic, we don’t like, but you’ve been around long enough to know multiple threads of different topics isn’t an issue.</p>

            <p>Cheers lads, my name is animaAdministrator (with the lowercase, as a grim reminder of the olden days); call me any permutation of that name you want. I&#39;m new here!<br><br>...Well, I&#39;ve known about the PPC for ages because I have a very strange love for original web fiction, but I&#39;ve never posted on the Board before.<br><br>I have plenty of fandoms, but many of them (mercifully) don&#39;t receive enough badfic to find their way here. Of the ones that do, the big fandoms which come to mind are Pokémon, Fire Emblem, Final Fantasy, and Kingdom Hearts. I&#39;ve had the (mis)fortune of being a gen fic writer in the Pokémon fandom for a long... long... LONG time, so I&#39;ve seen my share of literary slaughter. If you recall any fics written by Giratina, literally just Giratina, those were mine!<br><br>Anyway, thank you for having me.</p>

            <p>It&#39;s so wonderful to see so many new faces here! New faces, new ideas, even some returning faces! Ahh! Anyway, I&#39;m Twistey. I&#39;ve been on this Board for 1 year now, and I come up with a lot of ideas. I&#39;m good at judging short things like bios and general overviews, so if you have any agent ideas, I&#39;d love to see them!<br><br>So, what do you intend to do here? What type of badfic do you want to spork, and using what methods? Again, any agent ideas? I&#39;m also especially looking for people who would be willing to create animated missions with which to spork badfics in video format, fangames with which to spork badfics in fangame format, and/or mods with which to spork badfics in mod format, so if you do programming or animation, let me know.<br><br>Anyway, as for your newbie gift, here&#39;s that talking bass fish that you can put on your wall, as well as a kit to hack it with anything you wish. If you wish to give this virtual gift to your agents, they could hook it up to the console (resulting in a beeping fish), or if you want it, you could put Amazon Alexa in it. Just humor.<br><br>Anyway, it&#39;s nice to meet you! Hope you have a great time on the Board, and welcome to the PPC!<br><br>-Twistey</p>

<li>I do that too with my OCs. In fact, my first four PPC characters that I came up with were all revamps of mediocre original worlds that an old RP group I was a part of came up with. Since Skater has created a thread for this, you can see them there, or post your own old OCs in there.<br><br>2. Nice! I&#39;ll go check for video-format badfic on YouTube, just so you can check if it would be feasible to spork with an animation or not before I bring up the subject again.<br><br>-Twistey</li>

            <p>Ever-Styled Protagonist Hair? That&#39;s... a bit trickier. You see, Ever-Convenient Protagonist Luck™ is an all-pervading force in the Yu-Gi-Oh! continuum, so it&#39;s easy to capture some of its power without getting noticed. Hair, however, requires either messing with the canons (or original characters in goodfic) or harvesting some from Sues, and too much exposure to the glitter in that hair can lead to Sueicosis. But don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ll get you some if I can.<br><br>Again, welcome, and thanks for joining!</p>

            <p>Have this vintage Wattz 1000 Laser Pistol from the wastes of Fallout, complete with a pack of Small Energy Cells for fueling it with! It&#39;s not as powerful as the AEP7, but it&#39;s still plenty powerful enough to fry some Sues.</p>

            <p>On one hand... I&#39;m fairly certain that GiratinaXArceus counts as incest, seeing as Arceus directly created Giratina along with Dialga and Palkia.<br><br>On the other... they&#39;re both pretty much gods, with Arceus being the creator deity and Giratina being... erm, something close to Hades or perhaps Satan, although he controls the Distortion World, which isn&#39;t a form of afterlife. And in irl mythology, deities don&#39;t usually tend have the most stellar track record of avoiding incest... with Ancient Egypt being a stellar example.<br><br>So... it *might* not be a charge...? Or, at the very least, might not be as heavy of a charge as incest normally is in badfic...</p>
