            <p>What do you mean by spork? If you mean PPC missioning... well, slow down there. You can&#39;t write a PPC mission until you have Permission, which we don&#39;t usually grant to people who we don&#39;t know, and means you need to prove your writing aptitude. Don&#39;t worry, it&#39;s not scary. So the first step is... Stick around awhile! Post, discuss stuff, maybe contribute to a Prompt response or two (which are exempt from the Permission rule, as nothing is canon there anyways unless you <i>have</i> Permission and make it so). Go read <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=18hztHpDehxcfrjaXoFUew1vb0BdZPDAusHxMHzHiCzM">The Constitution</a>. Go read <a href="http://plotprotectors.tripod.com/TOS/">TOS</a>. Read a few spinoffs (I suggest Tales From DoGA and Nume and Ilraen—hope I spelled that right this time), get a few character ideas, and do a Permission prompt. <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/PPC_Wiki">The Wiki</a> has better advice than I could give on that. Also, you didn&#39;t really introduce yourself well, so here&#39;s me asking: Who are you? What are your fandoms? Gender and/or pronouns? What brought you here? All that stuff! Relax, pull up a chair and stay awhile! We don&#39;t bite. Well, except Huinesoron&#39;s evil twin. He might bite, I&#39;m not sure. Thing is, he never returns my calls, so I have no way of knowing, and I haven&#39;t heard a peep Dark!Thoth. :-P<br><br>If you&#39;re talking about MSTing... Well, there we get into The Art of Writing Good Snark. I&#39;m not the best person to ask. My suggestion, as always, is first to read a lot of other people&#39;s work, so you can see what a good MST looks like. Then figure out how to out your own spin on it. And... y&#39;know. Listen to advice from people who, unlike me, actually know what they&#39;re doing on that front.</p>

            <p>If we don&#39;t know you, we don&#39;t know how well you write/how willing to learn you are, and if we let people write missions who don&#39;t write well and maybe even aren&#39;t willing to learn, PPC missions would be very hypocritical, wouldn&#39;t they? That&#39;s why the Permission thing is in place. Nothin&#39; we have against ya. :)<br><br>A lot of newbies come in thinking that they can start writing PPC fic without having to get to know us and get Permission. Admittedly, it seems like that&#39;s how it was during the time of TOS (from reading the author&#39;s notes), but that&#39;s not how it is now. In order to both keep track of who all writes PPC missions (because having to get Permission makes it a lot harder for there to be missions we don&#39;t know about) and prevent any PPC badfic that&#39;s not part of the Badfic Games or any other joke event (see wiki), the Permission process was implemented at some point in time (maybe an oldbie can tell you when.) I know there are some users who have rushed in and then chilled out (i.e. me), but this can sometimes lead to unfavorable incidents stemming from impatience and/or failure to learn when they do try for Permission, on the part of the newbie. Sadly, it&#39;s even lead to some nasty things happening in the past, which further intensify our need for us to know who you are. So I also suggest that you do, in fact, relax, and see all that the Board has to offer. You won&#39;t be disappointed if you do.<br><br>-Twistey<br>(Note to other PPCers: Perhaps we could make the need for Permission less easy to miss on the Wiki? That might prevent some of this kind of stuff.)</p>

            <p>Very fun!  I love the sheer silliness of both AUs, even in the fact that they exist at all.  I love that you guys incorporated <i>Redwall</i>-style animal agents to represent the wildlife of both countries.  The goose was fun—I especially like that you state so matter-of-factly that it beat up the human agent without describing the fight.  Speaking as someone who has had to work with geese, its behavior is . . . FAMILIAR.  I would hate for Agent Canada Goose to meet up with Agent Cape Barren Goose from the Australian HQ.<br><br>Out of curiosity, what&#39;s the meaning of the joke about the DoSAT technicians&#39; names?  (At least, it felt like a joke/reference, disregard if I&#39;m wrong.)<br><br>The only technical thing my OCD whined about was the phrase, &quot;or some strange place that was some sort of off-AU-HQ.&quot;  The double &quot;some&quot; plus the vagueness of the phrase &quot;sort of&quot; is making it feel a little washed-out to me.  Though I&#39;ll admit I can&#39;t really come up with a way to rephrase it that doesn&#39;t sound clunky, soooo . . . maybe English just isn&#39;t equipped to express a phrase like that.  *shrug*<br><br>—doctorlit, wondering if the CPC only has access to Canadian-made continua . . .</p>

            <p>Glad we nailed the goose behaviour!<br><br>The technicians...well. Rogers and Bell are phone/WiFi/etc service providers, and both...have some issues. I&#39;m pretty sure it was ST&#39;s brainwave to make them Techies. Not included in the end were: Rogers&#39; little brother who goes around yelling &quot;Yahoo!&quot; a lot (Rogers has something to do with Yahoo! which is...it offers mail and I think has services along the lines of MSN? It&#39;s been a long time since I used it), and a new guy named Koodo who goes around trying to make things better (another, I believe newer provider, with fewer problems that I&#39;ve witnessed).<br><br>Hmm. I suppose that could become &quot;a strange place,&quot; but I&#39;d have to see it in context to be sure.<br><br>Glad you enjoyed!<br><br>~Z<br><br>PS: you might appreciate this: so much stuff couldn&#39;t make it in...including that the Flowers have become more...Canadian. Such as the Bonsai Maple. I think there was something about incorporating the official provincial flowers and animals as well? Anyway, quite a lot of animals floating around. And many squirrels, of course.<br><br>PPS: as to Canadian-made continua only...that would make sense to me, but we never discussed it that I remember. Although, do American productions filmed in Canada count? Because, for example, Supernatural is filmed in Vancouver...</p>

Doesn&#39;t that just sound <i>better</i>? A country is so much more majestic-seeming if it has its own <i>royalty</i>. Why would you give up the Royal Mail, the Royal Navy, and, er... Burger King I suppose, in favour of... I don&#39;t even know what, but I&#39;m certain it sounds worse.<br><br>Think about all your favourite books and movies for a second. <i>Lord of the Rings</i>? Aragorn becomes king. <i>Discworld</i>? Lord Vetinari is an absolute ruler. <i>Harry Potter</i>? Set in Britain, under the Queen. <i>Star Wars</i>, <i>Percy Jackson</i>, <i>Black Panther</i>... all the best fiction starts with a monarch.<br><br>So come on. Give up this frankly ridiculous pretense that doing anything other than returning to the Empire on which <a href="https://what-if.xkcd.com/48/?">the sun still never sets</a> is somehow &#39;better&#39;.

            <p>Fictional monarchies are nothing like the monarchy we had when we declared independence. Aragorn, Queen Amidala, and all those other such monarchs are just rulers. They let their people have a voice. King George III didn&#39;t let the colonies have any voice whatsoever, and basically treated them like a toy for him to play with.

<li>Aragorn becomes king... and then the narrator promptly gets back to the Shire, which isn&#39;t a monarchy. Tolkein knew we wouldn&#39;t want to stay after the ceremony was done.<br>2. Magical Britain does not, for the most part, adhere to muggle laws. The wizards have their own, elective government.<br>3. Star Wars started with an absolute ruler, but ended with him thrown into a bottomless pit and exploded, and everybody celebrating his death.<br>4. You do realize that most of the story of Percy Jackson involves going behind Zeus&#39;s back? <br><br>Quite frankly, the best thing to do with an absolute ruler is to crown them, have the cake, and then boot them out and elect the people you actually want to rule. We&#39;ve already been there and done that, so I think our business with the British Empire is done.<br><br>And also:<br><br>1. Star Trek has the United Federation of Planets.<br>2. Think about it- do you really want us back? We&#39;re a bit more... right-wing than the UK is. <br>3. It&#39;s been centuries. We made our country work. Get over it. <br>4. &#39;Brexit&#39;.

            <p>...heck, put some rice wine in it. Now we can talk like civilized people. Perhaps you might like some of this high-quality silk, or these ceramic plates? Note how thin they are, you can just about see your hand through it, but not even a direct hit with a sledgehammer could break it. You know what? We could send some Kroot mercenaries your way. If this goes well there might be some battlesuits in your future. Now, if you&#39;d just sign this free trade agreement, and this mutual defense pact, and this non-aggression treaty...</p>

            <p>&quot;Tea? You call this TEA?&quot;<br><br>Lord Militant General Smit leant down and tapped a blocky button on the panel in front of him. &quot;Could you offer us a few more thoughts, my good man?&quot; he asked. &quot;These Tow chaps don&#39;t seem to grasp the difference yet.&quot;<br><br>Chapter Master Wryght of the Glass Cannons turned to face the thick window. &quot;Real tea has <i>character</i>. Real tea has <i>potency</i>. Real tea has God-Emperor-damned <i>astringency</i>. This,&quot; he swung out with one massive hand, sending the Tau-made samovar crashing across the room, &quot;has none. It is...&quot; The Space Marine leant forward, eyes almost glowing as he glowered through the viewport. &quot;... <i>bland</i>.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Thanks so much, Chapter Master.&quot; Smit tapped another button, and a pair of servitors clunked into the room beyond the glass. One set to work clearing the spilled Tau beverege; the other handed the Space Marine a delicate, steaming china cup.<br><br>&quot;Ahhh.&quot; Wryght breathed deeply of the aroma rising from his cup. &quot;A lovely cuppa, Smit.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Not at all, old chap.&quot; The Lord Militant General pulled on a thick brass lever, lowering the shutters between the two rooms. &quot;It&#39;s best we leave him to it,&quot; he said to his guests. &quot;The servitors will be bringing in some biscuits in a minute; he can get rather... intense, what?&quot;<br><br>The two slender Tau looked at each other. &quot;I&#39;m afraid I don&#39;t understand... &#39;old chap&#39;,&quot; said the senior of the two. &quot;What are these &#39;biscuits&#39;? Some form of weapon?&quot;<br><br>&quot;My dear Por&#39;El, what do you take us for? Savages?&quot; Smit tapped yet another button, and the door shuddered open to permit a servitor to roll through, carrying a broad tray. &quot;Biscuits are... biscuits, obviously! Bis-cu-its. You see?&quot; He waved at the tray, which bore three full mugs and a tin plate, on which several round biscuits were laid. &quot;Mmm, looks like they&#39;ve dug out the coca chips; you&#39;re in for a treat.&quot;<br><br>The lead diplomat reached down, lifted a mug in one long-fingered hand, collected a biscuit with the other. &quot;How do they... combine?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Dipping!&quot; Smit collected his own drink and demonstrated. &quot;Mmm... takes the edge off the crunch, y&#39;see?&quot; He nibbled at the biscuit, beamed at the Tau over his mug. &quot;It would be the absolute <i>height</i> of embarassment to get crumbs everywhere, what?&quot;<br><br>&quot;What?&quot; The junior Tau looked up at the senior. &quot;Por&#39;El, this is-&quot;<br><br>&quot;Por&#39;Vre.&quot; The senior diplomat encapsulated all the warning that was needed in a single word, then turned back to Smit. &quot;We thank you kindly for the beverage.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Oh, it&#39;s nothing,&quot; Smit said, waving the comment away, his hand still holding half a biscuit. &quot;Now come on, drink up - don&#39;t let it go to waste!&quot;<br><br>~<br><br>With thanks to Scapegrace for Chapter Master Wryght, and apologies to the people of the Tau Empire for doubtless misrepresenting their esteemed Water Caste.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>So, I&#39;d gotten on a minor Ursula K. Le Guin kick earlier when someone pointed me at <i>The Left Hand of Darkness</i>. This led me to read <i>The Dispossessed</i>, and now I can come by with some hopefully somewhat coherent thoughts on it.<br><br>The plot: it exists, and there are sufficient amounts of it that you&#39;re reading a story and not a pile of worldbuilding calling itself a novel. (That is, this is not a Neal Stephenson book, but it does veer in that direction on occasion.) <br><br>However, the plot really isn&#39;t the point of the book. The point is to deliver on the subtitle &quot;An Ambiguous Utopia&quot;. We get the contrasts between Annares (a planet of anarchists) and Urras (the nearby planet they&#39;d left because that&#39;s how the revolution ended up getting resolved). The narrative structure (which alternates chapter-by-chapter between Shevek&#39;s time on Urras and the backstory that led him there) as well as the viewpoint character (Shevek, a physicist who ran into some of the problems with the society on Annares) gives us a good view of the upsides and downsides of both an anarchist society and much more typical places. (For example, even without laws, you&#39;re still likely to end up with some form of power structure and &quot;laws&quot; enforced by social consensus. On the other hand, down on Urras there&#39;s, say, a lot of poverty, sexism, capitalist/socialist &quot;democracies&quot; - this was written during the Cold War, that sort of thing.)<br><br>Overall, <i>The Dispossessed</i> basically presents some ideas about how society could work and doesn&#39;t hit you over the head too much with a desired conclusion (sure, it might have a pro-anarchist lean, but it&#39;s not being blatant about it). Personally, I didn&#39;t walk away too sold on the concept of this form of anarchism - it felt somewhat unworkable and that a lot of the problems inherent in power structures this system was meant to solve were still rather present on Annares. But I&#39;d recommend people interested people read for themselves and reach their own conclusions.<br><br>- Tomash, posting rambling thoughts on some book he read because why not</p>

            <p><i>Forbidden</i> is a full-length (ninety minutes!) musical on YouTube.  I will link to it in a moment, right after I warn for language and sexual innuendos in one song.  Language warning, and one song contains sexual innuendos!  Okay, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8giXiRyGbg">here</a> it is.<br><br>So the set-up here is that we&#39;re in an alternate history 1980s America, named Nacirema, where black and gay culture became dominant, rather than white and straight culture.  Just as in real life, the Bible is used to justify the dominant culture&#39;s oppression:  there are three commandments in this version, the first of which I couldn&#39;t actually understand because they were delivered through song lyrics.  Eh, we&#39;re on the internet, I guess I&#39;ll just listen again . . .<br><br>Ah, okay.  The first commandment is the one that gets broken by society constantly in both worlds: Love your neighbor.  It&#39;s the one that shows the people in the musical&#39;s society to be hypocrites, because of how straight and white people are treated.  Interesting that this was composed as the first commandment in the song, almost as though the singer/narrators are &quot;getting it over with&quot; so they can move on to the two commandments that are clearly more rigidly followed.<br><br>The second commandment I&#39;ll quote verbatim: &quot;Turn your back on things you don&#39;t understand.&quot;  This is essentially a direct contradiction of the first, as you can&#39;t love your neighbors if you turn your back on them; it implies that the community&#39;s love is only valid for those who follow the majority baseline.  It&#39;s also a reflection of our world&#39;s tendency to give more attention to problems affecting the majority, and overlook the suffering of minorities.<br><br>And the third is basically the one that  says that only same-sex partnerships are acceptable.  (The wording in the song is a little clunky to fit the meter, but that&#39;s what it&#39;s saying.)  I naturally would have loved to know more of the history of this setting, how their system of continuing the species works mechanically, though I understand the focus of the album is on injustice rather than world-building.  I got the gist of it: that children are born to some women (must be through artificial insemination, since &quot;breeder&quot; is a slur applied to straight people), then taken away and given to married gay couples to raise.  But I only saw couples with one child each throughout the whole video, which implies the population would drop by half with every generation, which isn&#39;t sustainable.  Maybe I just wasn&#39;t meant to think about it that closely, or maybe it&#39;s a literal degeneration meant to be a metaphor for the other failings of this society tearing itself down.<br><br>But that&#39;s not to say there isn&#39;t <i>any</i> world-building.  It&#39;s dropped through many minor details throughout the video, and they&#39;re all clever and fantastic.  Nacirema&#39;s flag is the U.S. flag with the red and blue colors reversed, and we get to hear what&#39;s essentially an alternate universe version of the real U.S. national anthem.  The protesters at the end bare signs that say &quot;God hates straights&quot; and &quot;Split and quit.&quot;  A white singer who performs a beautiful melodic song with undertones of equality barely gets any applause or other reaction from the all-black audience before her, but the following performance of black singers doing a very bland and simplistic pop song that only talks about general life gets the audience dancing and clapping along.  The main character, Noooolan?  I think I forgot his name, but he becomes the only black person in a prison filled with white inmates.  All these little moments feel normal and natural; I only recognize them as off by comparison to my own experiences in our world.<br><br>Particularly chilling are the moments where a upbeat, peppy song is undercut with a moment of grim prejudice. <br> One of these is when the song-and-dance routine in a diner is cut off completely when a white server spills coffee on a black woman&#39;s lap.  The entire diner, black and white, freezes to watch what happens—all knowing the power the black woman can potentially bring to bear over the white woman.  When the black woman sees that no one else is going to support her, she contents herself with storming out after calling the server an N-word variant.  (I don&#39;t care it&#39;s not <i>the</i> N-word; I&#39;m still not typing it out.)  Another was the scene where a black police officer guns down a white man who was innocently walking through an all-black neighborhood, all to a backdrop of jaunty harp and brass music, then proceeds to have a happy song-and-dance number with the black home-owners while the white man&#39;s body lays on the sidewalk at the side of the frame.  Towards the end of that song, the camera cuts to a close-up of a broom sweeping dirt under a rug.  These are great metaphors for the fact that while this society appears happy and friendly on the surface, there&#39;s some seriously dark happenings going on underneath that everyone would rather ignore than confront.  (By the way, that scene of police brutality takes place, appropriately, on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trayvon_Martin">Novyart street</a>.)<br><br>I also love the contrast between the costumes of the accepted gay community and the refuge for straight people.  The gay people dress in either bright colors or pastels, and in impeccably smooth 50s/60s dresses and suits.  The straight refugees dress in more modern clothing, with a lot of loose cloth, torn knees and elbows and uneven styles, and all in scales of grey.  Not only is grey the color born of mixing black with white, but it&#39;s also a drab color that blends in to the background.  It shows that when the straight protagonists were still trying to pass as gay, they had to put on a front that was meant to stand out and be seen by the rest of their community to match everyone, rather than be their base selves.  It&#39;s also representative of how minorities sometimes have to hide themselves from the view of society, blending in unseen to avoid being attacked.<br><br>There are a couple of songs about money that didn&#39;t really feel like they belonged.  I mean, they fit with the story line&#39;s progression, but not with the overall themes.  Or maybe I missed part of their point by not hearing all the lyrics?  Either way, it&#39;s still a strong musical, even though I could have done without those two.  There&#39;s also a bit of a weird plothole in that Nolan-if-that-is-his-name and Elle-I-did-remember-her-name-for-some-reason are both accused of heterosexual activity, Nolan is jailed and eventually hanged, but Elle is allowed to return to her wife and live on like nothing happened.  I mean, this isn&#39;t a big complaint, because I certainly didn&#39;t <i>want</i> her to be killed, it&#39;s just . . . it kind of leaves some questions, you know?  The wife must have had some reaction to everything going on, but we don&#39;t get to hear it.  It does feel a little missing something there.  But overall, it&#39;s a very creative and thoughtful musical that I heartily recommend.<br><br>—doctorlit has been a fan of Todrick Hall for a while now<br><br>♪I&#39;ve got a big black thick spoiler and I&#39;m not afraid to use it♪ ♪I&#39;ve got a big black thick spoiler and I&#39;m not afraid to use it♪ ♪I&#39;ve got a big black thick spoiler and I&#39;m not afraid to use it♪<br><br>(For the record, the word I replaced there is &quot;card,&quot; as in &quot;credit card,&quot; not whatever you were just thinking it was.)</p>

            <p>I think the first season of <i>Daredevil</i> was the last TV series I watched before I started reviewing everything on the Board, so I&#39;ll go over that here in addition to season two.  Spoilers for both seasons follow.  There&#39;s also some very vague, non-detailed allusion to some of the gore in the show.<br><br><b>season one</b><br>So, not having watched any Netflix originals before DD 1, I really didn&#39;t know what I was getting into before this, and I did not like what I saw initially.  I actually stopped watching for a long while—nearly a year, I think?—after the infamous car door scene.  The violence in this series was just so over-the-top and unnecessary, and it was making me a little sick.  I eventually got over it and finished for the sake of MCU completion, but I have little interest in ever watching again.<br><br>I first encountered Wilson Fisk in his animated adaption from the Spider-Man cartoon of the 1990s.  That version of Fisk, or Kingpin, was rather soft-spoken.  He was a threatening character, both physically and politically, but his was a quiet, confident menace, and that version of the character has stuck in my head as the baseline Fisk.  The Fisk in this show is such a departure from that, I really can&#39;t find myself liking him at all.  This Fisk is completely out of control of his emotions, easily insulted, and has a desperation to his success drive that make him rather a weak villain to me.<br><br>One thing season one did really well, though, was keeping the courtroom cases ongoing throughout the season, and making sure they had relevance and interest to the vigilantism side of Matt Murdock&#39;s life.  Season two didn&#39;t do that so well, I think.  That season mostly had Matt&#39;s law firm completely tied up in the Frank Castle case, and of course Nelson and Murdock disbanded towards the end, so we didn&#39;t really get much of the lawyer side of Matt&#39;s life.<br><br><b>season two</b><br>I was very pleased that, with the focus switching from fist fights to guns and swords, the violence actually got toned down for this season.  Somehow.  Still a lot of fake blood, but bullet holes are cleaner than, uh.  Eye self-impalement on nails.  So.<br><br>In a vacuum, Castle is a character I <i>should</i> despise, by all rights.  He fights with guns, and has every mark of a teen boy&#39;s edgy OC.  But man, the performance that actor put out.  Any scene where Castle is monologuing, I can just listen to forever.  Even with that rasp in his voice, his words and his facial expressions can be so heart-wrenching when he&#39;s talking about his family.  That&#39;s not to say I agree with his philosophy; I&#39;m much more in Daredevil&#39;s camp.  I do think some MCU villains did indeed need to be put down because of the threat they posed to the world, but not the street toughs and ninjas in <i>Daredevil</i>.<br><br>The whole ninja plotline, I&#39;m kind of lukewarm on.  They do make for an excellent physical challenge for Daredevil, since their silent movement makes them nearly undetectable to his senses until they&#39;re hitting him.  But their whole weird plot, with the resurrection, and the brainwashed human chemical mixers, and whatever crazy demon thing I thought was going to be in the giant stone coffin thing . . . I just didn&#39;t find all that as compellingly real as the other plot of the season, discovering the truth behind Castle losing his family.  I was much more curious about the identity of the Blacksmith than I was about the coffin, even though that plot got the finale climax.  (Although I love the fact that after Castle resolves his side of things, that he shows up to help with Daredevil&#39;s.  Like, &quot;Okay, the more important plot is done now, I can go help with the B plot next.&quot;)<br><br>A very rare thing happened while I watched this: I actually guessed a twist long before it was revealed, namely that Elektra is a Black Sky.  I&#39;m usually terrible about guessing those sorts of details ahead of time, since I tend to just let a story unfold itself before me without trying to deconstruct it much.  I very much enjoy those twist moments, too, so I&#39;m not necessarily <i>pleased</i> with myself; ruined the reveal moment for myself.  But there was just something about the way Stick would talk about Elektra that seemed to hint there was something actually wrong with her, and she seemed almost compelled to kill, rather than the matter-of-fact, business-like way Castle would gun criminals down.  Mix in my curiosity about the moment in season one when Nobu revealed that other people could be Black Sky beyond the one that got killed, and it all seemed to line up.<br><br>Ultimately, season two felt a little too stretched between its two plots, and the writers clearly wanted the mystical ninja plot to be the focal one, even though the government cover-up aspect was far more intriguing.  I&#39;m sure the whole Hand plotline will continue on in the <i>Defenders</i> series, but I hope it gets more interesting from here.<br><br>—doctorlit kept spelling &quot;Daredevil&quot; as &quot;Dardevil&quot; and he&#39;s really frustrated with himself right now<br><br>&quot;I&#39;d say Frank Castle is a man who would gladly give his life to keep spoilers safe.&quot; &quot;I&#39;d say Frank Castle is a man who would gladly give his life to keep spoilers safe.&quot; &quot;I&#39;d say Frank Castle is a man who would gladly give his life to keep spoilers safe.&quot; </p>

            <p>Have I mentioned that I willingly read children&#39;s literature sometimes?  Not young adult fiction, but like, overt children&#39;s books.  Because I do that.  Because I am a glutton.  Because I have no shame.<br><br>That said, it&#39;s been quite a while since I had one, and oh boy, did I step back into that genre with a doozy this time.  I had almost forgotten how no-holds-barred crazy classic kid lit could be.  Like, <i>The Witches</i> probably wouldn&#39;t get published today.  Spoilers follow for <i>The Witches</i> and for a little bit of <i>Charlie and the Chocolate Factory</i>.<br><br>Hard to know where to start, really.  I guess I&#39;ll start with the general tone of the story: I like that children&#39;s authors from Roald Dahl&#39;s era weren&#39;t afraid to scare kids.  Death and injury (loss of body parts even!), and the permanent and inescapable fates of some of the children described, and the absolutely horrifying description and illustration of the Grand High Witch&#39;s face are stuff for much older audiences, by most people&#39;s standards.  It makes it exciting for us older readers dipping in, to be sure.  But I like the implied respect for children behind this kind of writing.  The modern outlook seems to be that material kids consume has to be censored until they get older, so that they don&#39;t see something they don&#39;t understand that harms them in some way.  But the fact is, (I&#39;m getting very subjective here) an adult who didn&#39;t grow up processing tough things isn&#39;t suddenly prepared to process them the moment they turn legal age.  Our understanding of tough topics <i>comes from</i> meeting them head-on and digesting them as we grow.  (Wildly tangential but related note: the parents who turn a blind eye to kids chasing and scaring ducks at the zoo because &quot;they&#39;re just kids, it&#39;s what they do&quot; don&#39;t understand that those kids will grow up into adults who chase and scare ducks for fun; they need to be taught <i>as they grow</i> that scaring small creatures for amusement is wrong, or they&#39;ll never learn it.  And yes, I have seen grown people going after birds at work.)  I also strongly believe that children who encounter stories of intrepid-child-hero-against-super-powered-monster in their youth will find it much easier to cope with more mundane forms of antagonism, like bullies, as they grow older.<br><br>The general aesthetic and culture and outlook of the witches is simultaneously simplistic and juvenile, as befits antagonists in a story aimed at children, but also legitimately disturbing and creepy, just because of how disconnected it is from cultural norms.  Witches who hate children and target them with curses, that&#39;s a pretty standard concept.  But the motivation behind it—the fact that kids smell like dog feces to witches, and the presence of children ruining the view out the window—these are such simplistic sources of ire that it circles all the way around and becomes grotesque.  It&#39;s also rather amusing that the witches&#39; complaints about children are themselves incredibly childish reasoning.  It adds to the presentation of their demonic nature: they appear adult humans, but their motivations are so different from those of adult humans that they feel more like the child humans they loathe so much.  It&#39;s also interesting that the Grand High Witch, the designated leader and most respected and feared, is also said to be about four feet tall—by far the shortest witch, and with a mask that also makes her the youngest-looking witch.  Their leader is also the most childlike among them!<br><br>One thing that did bother me was how the story treated Bruno Jenkins.  He’s a fat boy who is basically given no personality beyond “likes to eat things,” other than one scene where he burns ants with a magnifying glass for amusement.  (Tangent: I apparently read this book once when I was very young, because I remember the ant scene, but had no context to place that memory in for years.  Funny how, in a book about demonic witches killing children, the one thing that bothered me enough to stick in my memory all these decades was the ant murder.  Especially ironic considering all the ants I have to kill every summer when the get inside exhibits.  I’ve still got ant bite marks on my ankles from this past Tuesday.)  Even after being turned into a mouse, Bruno’s only motivation is in stuffing his face, and makes his new mouse body <i>also</i> overweight in a matter of hours.  He doesn’t even participate in defeating the English witches in the final act, something a modern story would certainly have involved such a sidekick character in.  Between Bruno and Augustus Gloop from <i>Chocolate Factory</i>, I really am starting to feel like Dahl had some weird prejudice against fat people.  In fairness, I suppose in his time, overeating was viewed as more of a vice than a behavioral problem, and he doesn’t make it at least subtly clear that both characters’ parents are more to blame, but it still feels kind of weird to reduce a fat character to only their eating habits.<br><br>Come to think of it, Grandmamma (she wasn’t given a name, I don’t think) is pretty fat herself.  Maybe Dahl was only bothered by very young people who became overweight?  Either way, the way the narrative treats Bruno feels like it contradicts one of the main messages of the story, which is not judging people by their appearance.  The witches all dress like pretty women in public, but are barely human-looking demons underneath.  Tttttthhhhheeee uh wait, does the boy not have a name, either?  I think this is the first time I’ve gotten through an entire novel and not noticed that the two main protagonists didn’t have names.  Well, the boy gets turned into a mouse, but instead of being rendered weak and helpless, he uses his new body’s attributes to sabotage the witches’ plans and save all the other children in England.  And as a side note to that point, the witches assume the transformed mice children will be capturable with cheese in mouse traps, not realizing that they retain their human intelligence and memories after the transformation.  Finally, the grandmother, old and fat and walking with a cane, is an expert on witch behavior, and while we never get a clear picture of her background, I want to imagine she was a full on <i>Buffy</i>-style monster hunter in her youth.  Maybe it’s the fact that Bruno is <i>rich</i> that’s supposed to fit that theme: his family is clearly loaded, and all spoiled rotten and easily offended to boot.  Actually, they very much feel like the Dursleys minus Harry Potter, to the point where I could confidently label them AU alternates of each other.<br><br>So yeah.  <i>The Witches</i> is a legitimately creepy action story, even for my thirty-two-year-old brain.  Roald Dahl new how to write, just wish he wasn’t so judgmental of people for eating food.<br><br>—doctorlit remembers seeing the movie adaptation on tv long ago, but can’t remember it well enough to bring it up now<br><br>“Why did we not smell it before?  It stinks like a sewer!  Some little spoiler must be hiding not so very far away from here!” “Why did we not smell it before?  It stinks like a sewer!  Some little spoiler must be hiding not so very far away from here!” “Why did we not smell it before?  It stinks like a sewer!  Some little spoiler must be hiding not so very far away from here!”</p>

            <p>This was the first of the Marvel Cinematic Universe movies that my mom went to see with us!  She really enjoyed it, too.  I don&#39;t know if she would be into the more serious movies as much, but the humorous tone of the <i>Ant-Man</i> titles, coupled with this film doing a really good job of using natural dialogue to summarize the events of both <i>Ant-Man</i> and <i>Captain America: Civil War</i>, so Mom wasn&#39;t really lost about character relationships.  Spoilers follow for all three aforementioned movies, as well as <i>Avengers: Infinity Wars</i> and a bit of <i>Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.</i> season three.<br><br>I actually didn&#39;t like the original <i>Ant-Man</i> very much.  I found the humor was very juvenile compared to other MCU films (though not as bad as the <i>Guardians of the Galaxy</i> titles), and dominated the action and plot far too much for my liking.  This film did a much better job, not only with the quality of the humor, but in letting the more dramatic scenes play out uninterrupted too much.  Michael Douglas as Hank Pym especially improved as a result.  I felt like he wasn&#39;t entirely into it in the first film, as the delivery on a lot of his humorous lines sounded pretty disinterested.  For the sequel, he had a lot more opportunity to act in more dramatic and emotional scenes, and it really made Hank Pym feel a lot more real to me.  I especially liked the scene where Janet was speaking through Scott.  It got a lot of laughs in the theater, but the sincere acting job done by all three actors made very touching for me.<br><br>A-MatW is probably up there in my [arbitrary number] favorite Marvel movies.  It&#39;s just so well-written.  There are so many plot threads: Scott&#39;s relationship with his family; his conflict with the FBI; Hank and Hope&#39;s incomplete trust in him while needing to rely on him anyway; their desire to rescue Janet; the mobster dude being after their technology; Scott&#39;s coworkers trying to keep their company afloat; and Ghost and Professor . . . Teacher Guy trying to heal Ghost.  And everything slips along so neatly, it&#39;s such a smooth plot!  I especially like that this isn&#39;t another case of the villain getting killed off after a single appearance, but that they actually give Ghost the resolution she deserves, and maybe even set her up to be a continuing character, maybe?  Maybe we&#39;ll see her in <i>Avengers 4</i>?  I also like that the stepdad&#39;s character didn&#39;t backslide back to the first movie, and continue to treat Scott as a danger and a rival.  It would have been such a cliche to go that direction, so I&#39;m really glad he seems wholly supportive of Scott now, even considering his involvement in the events of <i>Civil War</i>.<br><br>As with the first movie, all the tricks with the growing and shrinking objects were really clever, and made for really creative fight scenes.  The car chase sequence at the end was especially fun, with Hope, Scott and Ghost all using their abilities to great effect to stay involved in it, even when they were on foot.<br><br>Going in, I was expecting the plot to pick up from the briefcase of Cross particles that was stolen by HYDRA in the first A-M, but they wound up not being involved.  Thinking it over after the movie, I realized that because  HYDRA was permanently shut down at the end of season three of <i>Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.</i>, all of HYDRA&#39;s assets are under S.H.I.E.L.D.&#39;s control again.<br><br>The light-hearted tone and fast-paced action of this movie were a great departure from <i>Infinity Wars</i>.  Up until those two ending scenes.  Ugh.  Again.  Dropped me right back into that feeling of dread I had throughout the ending of A:IW.  The second Hope&#39;s countdown stopped coming over the radio, I knew we had lost <i>someone</i>.  I sure didn&#39;t think it was going to be ALL THREE of Scott&#39;s main team.  It&#39;s especially nasty to realize that Janet finally got reunited with her family after thirty years, only for all three to be killed off by Thanos after a small number of weeks, if not days.  Did not want.  The ant playing the drum set later while the TV broadcasts are all failing wasn&#39;t very funny to me, either. We&#39;d better get all three back eventually, or I&#39;m going to be really upset.<br><br>—doctorlit is very happy that Kate from <i>Lost</i>  finally got a major movie role that isn&#39;t a canon-breaking elf, so bring her back, darn it!<br><br>&quot;Tell me you destroyed the spoiler.&quot;<br>&quot;Yes.&quot;<br>&quot;How could you destroy my spoiler?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Tell me you destroyed the spoiler.&quot;<br>&quot;Yes.&quot;<br>&quot;How could you destroy my spoiler?&quot;</p>

(*sticks tongue out at doc*) <br><br>Ghost in particular was the best part for me; Marvel has been really stepping up their game as of late with their villains, making them much more complex and nuanced. My personal theory is that she&#39;s going to be the one to save Scott from the Quantum Realm—from the way the Pyms were talking, it sounded like all they had to do to get him back was push a button (probably made improvements on the tunnel for easy access after what happened with Janet). And then they&#39;ll team up with the remaining Avengers to help take down Thanos.<br><br>As for the Pyms all getting poofed: They&#39;ll come back along with everyone else, I guarantee it. If and when Marvel kills off characters permanently, it&#39;ll be the old guard, the actors who are ready to move on and let others take the reins. The snap was easily undone in the comics, once Nebula got her hands on the Infinity Gauntlet, and I have no doubt that&#39;s what will happen here, too.<br><br>(Side note: Everyone in my theater gasped at the first end-credits scene. It was great.)<br><br>Anyway... I loved this movie and really want to see more of Ghost in the future.</p>

            <p>First, to answer Tomash’s question: I just finished <i>The Valley of Horses</i>, which I’ll go into below.  I’m nearing the end of the second season of <i>Daredevil</i>, and might be finishing that tomorrow, depending on how the timing goes.  And in a few hours, I’m heading to pick up my brother se we can go see <i>Ant-Man and the Wasp</i>.  Then the two of us are going to bring Mom to see <i>Solo</i>, which she hasn’t seen yet.<br><br><i>The Valley of Horses</i> is the second novel of the six-part <i>Earth’s Children</i> series.  Cassie5squared actually wrote a <a href="https://c5s-ppc-agents.livejournal.com/2805.html">PPC mission</a> to this series, although I haven’t read it yet, because I can’t tell which novel it’s set during.  Anyway, the series takes place during the Ice Age period in real world history, when both our subspecies of human and the Neanderthal subspecies were surviving together in what would later be named Europe.<br><br>Spoilers for books one and two of this series follow.  Also, warning for some discussion of sexual behavior later on.<br><br>I read the first <i>Earth’s Children</i> novel, <i>Clan of the Cave Bear</i>, before I started this “review all the things” policy I do, so I’ll touch on it, too.  For me, the world-building is absolutely the most top-notch aspect of this story (insofar as “world-building” can be applied to to a setting based on research into real world history, and can essentially be said to take place in reality).  I really liked how Auel presented the culture and lifestyle of the Neanderthal—or Clan, as they call themselves.  The idea that they had evolved a collective memory, and could literally call on the experiences of their ancestors to guide them, is of course fantastical and impossible to prove or disprove, but it’s an interesting way to contrast them with Ayla in this novel, and others of her people in the second, who are characterized more by imagination and ingenuity.  It also serves as an explanation for why our subspecies flourished (albeit with some Neanderthal DNA that we carry in our species to this day) while the Clan eventually perished: they became so reliant on their built-in memories to function, that they were unable to forge new strategies for survival as the world continued to change over the centuries.  I also like the detail that while Ayla’s people communicate in languages like we do, the Clan communicate mostly through a combination of body posture, facial expression, sign language and a few grunted words, accounting for their different mouth shape.<br><br>Auel’s narration style does something that’s normally “bad”: adding information that the characters the narration follows don’t and can’t know.  Sometimes comparing the animals in the story to their modern-day counterparts, sometimes explaining aspects of evolutionary theory that are far beyond the understanding of either human culture present at the time.  But in this case, I feel these “in-text author’s notes” are a true benefit to the story, as they help us modern readers put a greater context on the events and setting.<br><br>I’ll discuss Ayla here as well, since she’s in both novels.  As our wiki page for the series says, she has a lot of traits that our community especially would associate with Mary Sues.  While I can see that reading, I find it fairly easy to overlook.  The only aspect that gets kind of awkward to me is the fact that she’s blonde and blue-eyed, which calls up uncomfortable thoughts of designated Aryan protagonists among a more “primitive” culture, although I’m confident that wasn’t the author’s intent.  Other than that, all of Ayla’s victories feel to me more like she is a stand-in for our early ancestors’ successes and developments, rather than being a specific, mythic individual.  Ayla is sort of an avatar for our species, at least in my reading.  Additionally, any special treatment or other success she receives are always hard-won and emotionally taxing to her, especially during her time in the clan.  So I’m solidly in the not-a-Sue camp for Ayla.<br><br>Moving on to <i>The Valley of Horses</i>, we get more of that same excellent cultural world-building for the Earth’s Children, Ayla’s subspecies.  We also get a better idea of the geography of this land, more visually recognizable as Europe now.<br><br>This is where Ayla meets up with her own people finally, which becomes obvious as the novel begins flipping between Ayla scenes, and scenes with Jondalar and Thonolan traveling, early on.  This made it obvious they were going to meet up eventually, but I was pleasantly surprised at how long the narrative arcs were kept separate.  The meeting wasn’t rushed to meet another check on the overall plot.  Not only does this give us time to explore the culture of the Earth’s Children caves, but it also shows Ayla’s resourcefulness as she survives alone for three years in a valley.  It made the final meeting more exciting.  Even after Ayla and Jondalar meet, the language and cultural barriers between them isn’t rushed through, either.  It’s a very thoughtfully done premise.<br><br>I am annoyed that the Earth’s Children culture is presented as being so focused on sex, especially since they have no idea that there’s any connection between intercourse and reproduction.  I’m far more interested in the depictions of tool use and hunting and medicine in these early cultures, and the first novel was a lot more enjoyable than the second thanks to the lack of sex scenes.  But I guess that’s a situation I just have to deal with as an asexual person consuming media.<br><br>—doctorlit, off to the movies next<br><br>“Only once did he initiate the spoiler prematurely and scatter a herd in advance of the pit.”  “Only once did he initiate the spoiler prematurely and scatter a herd in advance of the pit.”  <br>“Only once did he initiate the spoiler prematurely and scatter a herd in advance of the pit.”  <br></p>

            <p>Caves of Qud is bloody <i>great</i> and it has <i>great</i> lore. It&#39;s probably what got me into New Weird, to be honest. <br>Hell, one of the lore books was written by a sentient plant called Baccata Yewtarch. For his sources, he cites sentient fungus that have travelled across the world, attached to travelling camel-guy merchants. The weirdest part is really the fact that Baccata overlooked the seeming speciesism between plants and fungi enough to source them in his books. Good on him! <br>It&#39;s so <i>cool</i>. <br><br>I recently finished rereading another kinda surreal weirdo story - <i>The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath</i>, Lovecraft&#39;s outright longest story. It&#39;s the fantasy novella that sorta defined my own tastes in speculative fiction and worldbuilding - there&#39;s a dreamy surrealism to the whole thing, that feels almost fairy tale-like, that I&#39;m absolutely in love with. Hell, the start of the story just offhandedly describes that a specific tree in a forest was grown from a seed that fell from the moon, and later on in the story, it&#39;s revealed that you can just kinda - just sail right up to the moon! <br>Here&#39;s what it has for &#39;races&#39;: <br><br>- Humans (of course)<br><br>- Zoogs (vaguely human-eating sapient rodents who live in a glowing fungus forest and make wine out of that moon tree.) <br><br>- Cats (sapient and basically the &#39;hero&#39; race, who are all kinda honourable and good and who help the main character out.) <br><br>- Ghouls (loathsome corpse-eaters who dwell above a massive pit of bones of every thing they&#39;ve eaten, who have access to every graveyard of the waking world, and are actually pretty reasonable guys, who outright help the main character out and beat up monsters with giant tombstones.) <br><br>- Moonbeasts (frog-looking amorphous silvery things, who are implied to buy and eat slaves and who sail about from the moon and the Dreamlands. They&#39;re the Orcs but squishier, I suppose.) <br><br>And probably heaps more, because the Dream Cycle is <i>wild</i>. <br>It&#39;s an awesome bloody setting, and that story is an awesome bloody story that has an <i>insane</i> ending, and one that&#39;s surprisingly tender and personal, considering how weird and cosmic the story is. It&#39;s real good. Probably my favourite Lovecraft story, to be honest. <br><br>The only real shame I have with it is, well, it&#39;s hard to get as connected to it as I want to, knowing how horrid of a person Lovecraft was, y&#39;know? There are themes in that story that resound a whole lot with me but also, er, he was racist. </p>

            <p>It being vacation, I&#39;ve been reading a whole lot of things. A standout was <i>The Goblin Emperor</i>, by Katherine Addison. It too is more focused on world-building and characters than plot, but it&#39;s charming and lovely and has loads of fantasy politics (yay fantasy politics!). The <i>Divine Cities</i> trilogy by Robert Jackson Bennet was also some really sweet unique fantasy (i.e. The gods are dead, what happens after?); each book in the trilogy felt different in a very good way, but the themes all coalesce so well at the end of the last book. The <i>Six of Crows</i> duology and <i>The Illuminae Files</i> are probably way too YA for the tastes of most here, but I freaking loved them, so I recommend them anyway. <i>Uprooted</i> by Naomi Novik was another standout, and it hits that sweet spot between YA and adult fantasy, so that gets a blanket recommendation. Everyone should read it! There are evil trees!<br><br>In terms of comics, I&#39;ve been working through Marvel&#39;s new <i>Star Wars</i> runs, and I&#39;ve been enjoying (most of) them a lot! They fill in quite a few plotholes in very natural ways. I&#39;ve also been reading <i>Descender</i> by Jeff Lemire, and for some reason it reminds me of the webcomic Space Boy (just with... yanno, a spot of torture here and a bucketload of existential angst there, as opposed to warm fluffiness). I really wanted to like <i>Joyride</i> by Colin Lanzing, because there are not enough colorful space opera comics in the world (<i>Empress</i> by Mark Millar is one that I recommend highly), but the author just didn&#39;t have a handle on character development and the main character was a jerk anyway.<br><br>Current soundtrack to my life is <i>Pray for the Wicked</i> by Panic! At The Disco.</p>

            <p>One is YA fantasy (like a very large percentage of the stuff I read). It’s called Caraval and for once “Nothing is what it seems” is (almost) literally true.

Look, this is probably kind of time-wasting, and I'm sorry, but Gwil--my fire lizard--she saw me writing messages and got very, very insistent, so...uh, to all your fire lizards, Gwilithiel the gold (ha, sounds like a wizard name) sends her greetings and wishes you...something to do with food, I don't even know what she's trying to get across.

<p>So, ah, yes. This would be me, casually contacting people who retired soon before I even joined. Because of a fire lizard who got really excited at the idea of multiple fire lizards and writing messages.</p>

            <p>Agent Huinesoron, greetings.</p>

<p>To my knowledge, we have never met; and perhaps there is just cause for it. Should that prove true, I will not waste your time in argument.</p>

<p>However: I am Noldorin, as, I hear, are you, and was of the First Age besides. Should you wish it, I would be glad to make your acquaintance. To speak to another who lived in the same lands, with the same cultures--it would be a grace I had not thought to find after my partner's departure for Endor.</p>

<p>Yours in hope,
Naergondir</p>

<p>--
((I did think of sending a message to Dafydd, but on the one hand he already has a question, and on the other...that would be <i>so awkward</i>. "Hello! I, er, hear you...ah...might have been...Maglor. How...nice. Excuse me while my wish to stay far away from you wars with my wish to talk to someone who lived through my time..." I mean, in an interlude it could be pretty amusing, but for a message exchange I'm not sure how well it'd hold up. Though you never know, I guess. ~Z))</p>

            <p>Hera, of course, is <i>far</i> too good to do any work beyond carrying messages, and Ilwion is a bit... well, spoiled these days.

            <p>Ninetwo: <i>Frankly, ummm, this strikes me as deeply offensive - not just to our employers, who have spent much time, and effort, and, um, time, into creating as ideal of a work environment as they can, but to us employees - us, who place our trust, our hopes and dreams on the backs of our great leaders in the Janitorial Division management! To denigrate them would be to, by extension, denigrate us, and I refuse to do that!</i> </p>

<p>Finch: '<b>It-s a justice we really bloody ought to have and, because of that fact, we never will ever have it. All these gits are whinging about "not being fired" and "job security" and "milking any form of miniscule payment out to survive to next week". You think <i>you-ve</i> it rough? Every day, all day, I-m out here <i>dying</i>, but that never strikes <i>them</i>, does it?!</b> </p>

<p>Bingle: 'Oh, well, I suppose it could be a fun day out, couldn't it?'</p>

<p>Anne: 'We tried that once in the early days. I don't think there's many people left in JD who'll remember it. Everybody went on strike. It dissolved pretty fast when we realised we all lived in here, and that all the falling infrastructure and angry goops and gases would be going after <i>us</i>, too. 
I don't think I care so much about my own rights, anyway.' </p>

<p>Anne's Cat (written by Anne): 'My cat scratched out the word "union" and then ate the whole letter. Now she's spitting up shards of it into the rubbish bin. She hates all kinds of rights, especially human ones. I think she would be inherently against this.' </p>

            <p>Seriously?</p>

<p>Then again, I've seen the latest report. You're going to twist what I say no matter what...</p>

<p>Well, then. Yes. I am absolutely taking advantage of Zeb. Because that's apparently what I do, taking advantage of people like this, so obviously that's what's been happening with Zeb. I definitely didn't have a conversation with him three years ago about what exactly he could expect from me, and I've absolutely seduced him multiple times into the salacious art of baking pies and watching movies. He's definitely only with me because I've overwhelmed him or blackmailed him or something like that.</p>

<p>You know, considering this has been going on for <i>three years</i>, wouldn't someone like Dawn or, I don't know, the Aviator have put a stop to it by now if I really was taking advantage of Zeb? Assuming he wouldn't have done it himself? Sometimes you people just don't <i>think</i>.</p>

            <p>Endor did not contain so many devices made of moving metal parts and surfaces which display information. This unfortunately necessitated the invention of words on our part, although in some cases we have simply borrowed the English term. However, describing them was less strange than learning to use them; for my hands, by then, were more accustomed to grip a blade than a device which even the crafters among the Noldor would not have thought to design. I will not deny their usefulness, but neither can I ignore the lack of grace in their shaping.</p>

<p>Culturally, it has been strange; but how could it not be so, when our kindred here are few and scattered? It is not so dissimilar, however, to some places in Endor, and so, though it is sometimes lonely, it is not unbearably unfamiliar.</p>

            <p>Alexander, do those other reasons for being around Bad Slash have anything to do with the sudden spike in agents wandering around in a daze? And if you didn't pay anyone to set off that quake, did you maybe call in a favor or five to have it done and set up alibis? And is it true that you brought your little sister, Selene, to Rudi's to give her a head start on becoming an agent like her big brother? Did she really come away with the heart of another agent devoted to her?</p>

            <p>Questions are open to my perpetually potential agents, Larkus and Curff, who will totally eventually exist once I can be bothered to stop procrastinating and actually write a Permission piece, as well as a newcomer to my roster who I have yet to settle on a partner for.</p>

<ul>
<li>Agent Larkus Grun, DMS. Forcibly retired officer of the Coruscant Security Force, rambler, gambler, and fugitive from Imperial justice. </li>
<li>Agent Turff-Croft, A.K.A. Curff, DMS. Lupin Sorcerer of the Ninth Circle of the Ashen Hill (translation: level nine D&amp;D sorcerer, homebrew setting), Retired Adventurer, amateur alchemist, comfortable chair enthusiast.</li>

<li>Rinnel Anweir, a new arrival from the setting of The Bastion Walls, one of my own as yet unfinished stories. Boatswain of the airship <i>Starlight Dancer</i>, thief, pickpocket, smuggler, and general scoundrel.

            <p>But then, diplomacy has never been my strong suit, so why not? </p>

<p>I suppose if I were to pick something I truly dislike, it would be summed up in one word: paladin. I can not abide moral busybodies poking about in the affairs of others. If I needed someone bleating in my ear to do my job I'd have stayed home. </p>

<p>However, in fairness to Larkus, he has thus far not unreasonably intruded on my business. For his sake I hope it stays that way.</p>

<p>Larkus: I try to find the good things about people more than the bad, but If you're gonna put me on the spot, I'll say this, he's overdue for an attitude adjustment. He's not the worst company I've had, but I think his powers have gone to his head a touch. Arrogant, you know? I get it, he's a mage, he's older than me, he thinks he knows the ropes, but he's liable to get us both killed if he doesn't learn how to work with a partner soon.</p>

            <p>Being dropped in the badfic mess without a brief and the fireworks at the DoSAT when we got back take the cake by far. I heard some Techies are still keeping a grudge.</p>

<p>But if you're thinking... before, then I'd say that was about one year after learning about magic. Back then, we'd figured out the worst of the accidental hexing was behind us, with knowing how to avoid the worst of it now. I had came back home for a family movie night after a... special lesson with my master, so I was already tense.  The movie was... Madagascar 2, just a nice little thing my little sister could enjoy too for us to watch. I'm relaxing... Then our phone begins ringing. It's ridiculious, but that's so unexpected it got me jumping out of my armchair... Straight out of my circle. Bye Bye TV. And since by that point I'm also feeling this is my fault and getting pretty frustrated at the relapse... Living room electronics follow by the time I'm getting it under control. I was feeling real bad by the time it was over. </p>

            <p>In my experience, it pays to look at what people do, not only what they say. Farilan is... difficult, that is true. She is very intelligent and very prideful, which is not always a harmonious combination. However, this masks a charming curiosity and even innocence, I would say. She seeks to learn more about this strange multiverse and the strange beings in it, but to one raised in a culture such as ours, with very rigid expectations and rules for every occasion, they can be surprising, alarming, even disturbing. I am her guide through this bewildering array of strangeness. Although I am strange myself, I hope that she feels she can always rely on me, for anything.</p>

            <p>I live at home with my mom. I go to school at the Nursery. I like it, because all my friends are there and usually classes are fun. You have to know a lot of stuff in the PPC. We do a lot of spelling and grammar and writing work, which gets pretty boring, but canon classes are great! Sometimes we even get to go on field trips to the OFUs. It's not exactly the real thing, but it's pretty cool. Other places are so big and bright and colorful, not like HQ at all. The first time, it was a little bit like that one book, <i>The Giver</i>, which has a movie that's not very good. We did a paper on it last year. Wanna know what I said?</p>

<p>In answer to your question, no. I presently have no romantic interests. I respect Derik, and we share a kinship, forged of a mutual respect and understanding. It seems some people are incapable of distinguishing this from romance. This is neither my fault nor my responsibility.</p>

            <p>A well structured diet contributes to bodily heath, it is true. I would additionally suggest a rigorous training regimen, the implantation of artificial organs, the use of drugs and hypnosis to aid in the use of such, and several centuries of combat. The Adeptus Astartes has proven this strategy to be effective, provided you are one of the few males eligible.</p>

<p>If you are female or otherwise ineligible, earning the favor of the Blood God is, of course, an alternative. However, this is not a path I would recommend.</p>

            <p>But I do know they exist in their own parallel kitchens. We sometimes leave each other notes, whenever our planes of reality overlap. My favorite pen buddy cook is Zurek the Tuskarr. </p>

<p>As for the other part, of COURSE I'm freaking out about it, why did you bring it up!? But..  for now one thing that's keeping me grounded to the kitchen is my desire to break the Cafeteria's Curse of Comedically Catastrophic Cuisine.</p>

            <p>Definitely the S'cream-of-Spinach Soup. Some rookies plundered a whole bunch of food from the "Kids Next Door" continuum. And Grandma Stuffum's food tends to be even more risky than ours. But the spinach looked surprisingly nice... That was my mistake.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, it seems like the CADs exploding is a direct result of Rule of Funny. Us techs have tried everything we can think of: fireproofing, redundant systems, you name it. You can take a flamethrower to a CAD and it'll be fine after, but put it near someone too OOC and... kaboom. You just learn to accept you'll be repairing the damn things for the rest of your career.</p>

            <p>See, Phyrexian Oil is not messing around.  It&#39;s like the Borg and the 40K Warp had an unholy lovechild.  It will assimilate you and turn you into a plague-vector.<br><br>If it is detected immediately (and I mean damn-near instantaneously), then fire could potentially work, but whoever brought it in is going to burn, too.  They&#39;re contaminated, you see, and there&#39;s only one cure that I&#39;m aware of: A single Elf named Malira who is somewhere on New Phyrexia.  I wouldn&#39;t take the time to find her.<br><br>If it is not caught immediately, it could spread like wildfire.  Janitorial would probably be compleated first, while cleaning it up.  Now we&#39;ve got Phyrexian Flowers.  Probably no way to contain it at that point.  Shifting hallways makes containment a major problem.<br><br>Gods help us if it ever compleats a Sue.  Glistening Oil is bad enough.  Sparkling Oil?  Terrifying.<br><br><br>I guess the point I am trying to make is that Phyrexian Oil only leads to one place: Character Deaths.  If that&#39;s what you&#39;re going for, then by all means have at it.<br><br>-Phobos, advocating against this.</p>

            <p>No need to worry at all - us janitors can be shocking in both how fast we are all able to flee from perceived dangers, and also in how quick we all are able to turn to nearly total cowardly treason when our lives are on the line. <br><br>Indeed, each janitorial shift that has existed for more than about a month or so individually possesses at least one unique method of instantaneous escape from HQ, usually to some form of forest or alleyway somewhere, where a new life, undetected, can be hastily made. <br>I even knew a shift that physically tunneled a hole from their own closet right into a grotto somewhere in Switzerland, where they had already prepared a small barebones cabin, in deep preparation for <i>exactly</i> this kind of circumstance! <br><br>So there is no need, no need at all, to be concerned for the safety of the Janitorial Division! <br>Except against the burning vicissitudes of guilt, one supposes, but, well, dark pasts always do end up turning out well for us sorts, anyway, don&#39;t they? </p>

Which, gurl, you know darn well I don&#39;t like.&quot;<br><br>&quot;This from the girl who planned my surprise birthday party.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Hey, yo, don&#39;t try and make this complicated. It&#39;s super simple. I like planning surprises because I like being in control of a situation. When I&#39;m not, I panic. You, on the other hand, love surprises, so I planned your birthday party.&quot;<br><br>&quot;For four in the morning.&quot;<br><br>&quot;What&#39;d I just say about making this complicated?&quot;<br><br>&quot;... Fine.&quot;<br><br>The two surveyed the burning wreckage of the corridor. A skinny man with a mop rounded the corner, had a brief argument with a vending machine, and decided this was someone else&#39;s problem.<br><br>&quot;Cass, your homefic doesn&#39;t really have a tradition of moulding fire with your bare hands, does it?&quot;<br><br>&quot;... Iiiiiiiiiiiit actually does.&quot;<br><br>&quot;You&#39;re paying for my new wardrobe.&quot;<br><br>&quot;D&#39;you mean the clothes or the item of furniture?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Today.

            <p>I think this response did a good job of telling the story with almost entirely dialogue.

He felt a little vertigo now as he looked down, but there were a good few metres between him and the drop.<br><br>Not far below him, what he had thought was just another bit of roof swung up and his sister’s head poked out of the gap.<br><br>“How did you get up there?” he asked, annoyed.<br><br>“Stairs,” Holly said, glaring at him.<br><br>“Oh, of course!

            <p>“Why the hell did he choose the third floor?” Creed complained. “It&#39;s an abandoned office building, surrounded by nothing but fragging abandoned office buildings. Couldn&#39;t he hold the meeting on the ground floor?”<br>Blades ignored the  stocky rigger. The stairs didn&#39;t particularly bother him anyway. <br>“Maybe you should ask Schmidt for compensation,” Scathach suggested with a grin.<br>“For the record, that was sarcasm. If you actually try that, I&#39;ll personally kick you out the window,” Dragonfly said, and glared at them. “Anyway, we&#39;re here now, so if all of you could act professionally, please?” <br>She opened the door. Inside, Herr Schmidt was already waiting.<br>“You&#39;re late,” the Johnson said, looking at his watch. “I hope you at least have the package.”<br>“Took us more than enough to get it,” Dragonfly grumbled, but handed the device over to him. “I prefer to know beforehand if a run is going to land us in a Zero Zone.”<br>“You&#39;ll get your reward soon enough,” Schmidt said, taking a closer look. <br><br>Then everything happened at once. The Johnson blinked, and turned his back to the large window that took up one of the walls. A fraction of a second later the window exploded into a hail of shards. Schmidt straightened back up, decked Dragonfly in the face, and lunged out of the window.<br>Blades started moving before Dragonfly finished shouting “Get him!” from where she was lying on the floor. The Johnson had jumped six metres across an alley, and through a missing window into a neighbouring office building.<br>Blades grinned. The magic was flowing through his veins, strengthening his limbs, carrying his body.  He drew his sword from its sheath as he started running. Six metres was almost nothing to him. He pushed himself off from the edge, sailed through the air... and realized with a start that his trajectory was off. He just had time to spit out a curse before crashing into the plastcrete half a metre to the left of his target.<br>His fingers grasped uselessly after some kind of ledge or windowsill as gravity made itself known and he started falling towards the pavement. The impact knocked the breath from his lungs and bruised his ribs. He silently thanked both his armour and his magic for lessening the impact and preventing serious injuries. He rolled onto his knees while gasping for breath. Despite his helmet the impact had made him dizzy, but he focused on his sword, which was lying a few metres away from him. Finally managing to draw a breath, he pushed himself to his feet, grabbed his sword and made his way to the door of the building he&#39;d intended to jump into. He drew another deep breath, opened the door and started running up stairs as fast as he could.<br><br>In the end, it had turned out he needn&#39;t have hurried. They had found the Johnson cornered by one of Creed&#39;s drones and had managed to get a good amount of money out of him. <br>Scathach alternated between rewatching a video of Blade&#39;s chase attempt and looking at him as Creed took a look at his bruises. <br>“You know, I think I&#39;ve got a good name for you,” she said. “The way you flew through the air like nothing could ever happen to you right before crashing gloriously gave me an idea.”<br>“You&#39;re still going on about the name thing? Can&#39;t you give me some rest?” He asked.<br>“For the last time, calling yourself &#39;Blades&#39; makes you sound like an edgy 14-year-old. You need a proper nickname.”<br>Blades sighed, “What are you thinking about?”<br>“Icarus.”</p>

            <p><i>The sting of the needle was nothing compared to the agony he’d felt over the past sixteen years. He was a warrior now—no, more than that. He was a champion. He&#39;d earned his tattoos at long last—the mark of a favored gladiator.<br><br>“You did good out there today, kid,” Mako said. The older gladiator was leaning against the wall to watch the progress being made on 8386071’s skin. Already, both arms, legs and his torso had been adorned, and his face was almost finished. <br><br>“Thank you,” 8386071 said, smiling up at him. <br><br>“The Master’s pleased for now, but don’t get ahead of yourself,” the attending overseer, Harkon, grunted. “Just because you got those marks doesn’t mean I can’t still whip you, boy.”<br><br>8386071 resisted the urge to duck his head. “Of course, sir.”<br><br>Internally, he was seething. He knew Harkon couldn’t take him in a fight, but the overseers held all the power thanks to the explosives implanted in the slaves.</i><br><br>One of these days, <i>he thought to himself as the needle was finally removed from his face.</i> One of these days, I’ll earn my freedom, and I’ll cut you down where you stand.<br><br><br>&quot;Lorson?&quot; Dax said, shaking him out of his reverie. &quot;You alright? You looked like you were spacing out.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Hm? No, I&#39;m fine,&quot; Lorson said, bending over his knee again. A flap of skin had been peeled away to let him work on the implants within. &quot;What were you sayin&#39;?&quot;<br><br>Dax shrugged. &quot;Just wondering if there was a story behind the tattoos, that&#39;s all.&quot;<br><br>Lorson glanced down at his remaining arm, at the 8386071 etched into his skin.<br><br>&quot;I just thought they looked nice,&quot; he said. </p>

            <p>Yes, you read that right. Rita Skeeter (or a cunning replacement who contrived to keep her name?) has made it to the PPC, and is now writing for the Multiverse Monitor.<br><br>Her mission? To interview Jacques Bonnefoy, as a hard-hitting reporter should, and to bring to you, dear readers, the whole unvarnished truth about this seductive former character replacement who recently celebrated his fifth year at HQ!<br><br>Excerpts from the interview follow:<br><br><i>His beautiful blue eyes, sparkling only seconds ago with the thrill of attempted seduction (to which, dear readers, I can only hope not to succumb before finishing the interview!) turn misty with the remembered grief of cradling the corpse of Ianto Jones.</i><br><br>...<br><br><i>&quot;You know,&quot; he says, leaning forward in a way that emphasizes the powerful muscles in his shoulders, &quot;I </i>love<i> your hair.&quot; He pauses, and sorrow is clear in his deep voice as he continues. &quot;Rose dyed her hair to get that exact shade, you know. She&#39;d be so envious.&quot;</i><br><br>...<br><br><i>&quot;Are the rumors true?&quot; I have to ask, even if it pains him. I am committed to the truth. &quot;That you remember a relationship with Rose Tyler and the Ninth Doctor beyond what is shown on the show?&quot;<br><br>He shakes his head. &quot;I&#39;m afraid not. They...they never did quite see me the way I saw them.&quot; He forces a smile; even with little heart behind it, it is enough to steal one&#39;s breath. &quot;Can I get you a drink? Reporting is very hard work.&quot;</i><br><br>...<br><br><i>&quot;But enough about me, Ms Skeeter,&quot; he says. He pulls me close, fingers trailing tingles up and down my arm. &quot;I want to know about you. Someone with such an impressive reporting history must have some good stories to tell!&quot;<br><br>To my surprise, I find myself giggling, blushing, looking down in a coy way I abandoned soon after my teens. Something about this man brings out the excitement of youth, of that first, most breathtaking crush that never quite leaves you for years afterwards. &quot;Oh, I do,&quot; I say. I yearn to impress him, but that&#39;s not why I&#39;m here--and besides, I&#39;d much rather hear him talk. &quot;But they&#39;re nothing compared to yours.&quot; I look up at him through my long eyelashes, feeling shy--and, dear readers, I haven&#39;t felt shy in years! &quot;Would you tell me more about your early days in ESAS? The first person you seduced in HQ?&quot; </i>How you&#39;re managing to make me melt in ways no man has managed since a reporter&#39;s cynicism changed my perspective forever?<i><br><br>He chuckles--the warmest sound I&#39;ve heard--and pulls me even closer. There are people who would call this scandalous. &quot;Why don&#39;t I tell you,&quot; he murmurs wickedly, &quot;about how I plan to seduce </i>you?&quot;<br><br>...<br><br><i>Somehow--I&#39;ll never quite know how--I manage to scrape together enough of my composure to ask him another question. &quot;You seduce so many people--is it always a split second decision, or do you take your time before approaching them?&quot;<br><br>He pulls back the slightest bit, leaving me oddly bereft. His warmth had enveloped me without my noticing. &quot;Oh, it depends on the person. There are people I&#39;ve waited five years without seducing.&quot;<br><br>I sense a story here--perhaps one of longing--and so I question him further. &quot;That sounds like a seduction--or several--to remember. What kept you from doing it earlier?&quot;<br><br>&quot;The time wasn&#39;t right,&quot; he says.<br><br>His eyes are on my mouth. They are surely intent enough to set me on fire--and I want to burn.<br><br>&quot;Did you always plan on seducing </i>me<i>?&quot; I ask. My breath is so fast--my heart is racing. He could do anything in this moment, and so long as he touched me, I&#39;d never protest. Such is the power of his presence.<br><br>&quot;I decided to try five minutes after you walked in,&quot; he says. His voice is low. Honesty, earnestness--they shine from his face, in his smile, in the way his eyes caress my skin--and then it&#39;s his hands I feel skimming up my arms, and he leans in close. &quot;Tell me, lovely Rita--have I succeeded?&quot;<br><br>I kiss him in answer--or I would, but that would go against my professionalism. He has no such compunctions, however, and in seconds, his lips are on mine.<br><br>Dear readers, you know I strive to describe to you everything worth knowing--and a kiss from this man is well worth knowing. But how could mere words convey this? Were I to tell you his lips are soft and his hands wander, I would be remiss--for that description ignores the confident step closer, the care not to disturb my hair, the sheer, all-consuming focus that overtakes the one being kissed--for how could it not? His complete attention is on the kiss, and on the person being kissed--and I could describe this to you a thousand times over, and still fail to encapsulate the true feeling of kissing Jacques Bonnefoy.<br><br>For once, dear readers--and you know well how infrequently this happens--words fail me.</i><br><br>--<br>...more to come?<br><br>(Did Rita get more than a kiss? Has Jacques been truthfully represented in this interview? Are there any parts of this article that <i>would</i> sound out of place in a Harlequin romance novel? Find out sometime!)</p>

            <p>She tends to, after all--the Quik Quotes Quill certainly made some interesting things out of Harry&#39;s answers in the fourth book. She&#39;s just taking a...slightly different tack with Jacques, even if she does do a fair bit with his angst as well. She&#39;s also added things, and twisted them--for one thing, the only dead Ianto Jones Jacques has ever come in contact with was a replacement. He was recruited long before Ianto&#39;s death in canon and thus has no memory of it.<br><br>In fact, a regular version of the final two excerpts might run like so:<br><br>Well, that hadn&#39;t worked. She was still impressively undistracted from all the questions he didn&#39;t want to answer. He had to admire her tenacity, even if he wished she had less of it.<br><br>Time to step up the game.<br><br>&quot;Enough about me, Rita.&quot; He pulled her closer, trailing his fingers over her arm. &quot;Tell me about you. Someone with your reporting history must have some <i>great</i> stories to tell!&quot;<br><br>She giggled and looked down--good. Maybe this would actually work. It was certainly the only thing he&#39;d found so far that <i>did</i> distract her--he&#39;d noticed the discreet admiring looks almost immediately. They would have been far more welcome if they hadn&#39;t come as the side dish to a whole bunch of painful questions.<br><br>&quot;Oh, I do,&quot; she said. &quot;But yours--yours are so very interesting. Tell me more about your early days in ESAS. Or maybe about the first person you ever seduced in HQ?&quot;<br><br>Jacques chuckled, the sound only a little forced, and pulled her even closer. If this didn&#39;t move the interview in a far more interesting direction, he had no idea what would. &quot;Why don&#39;t I tell you about how I plan to seduce <i>you</i>?&quot;<br><br>Gratifyingly, her eyes widened--and, for the first time since he&#39;d met her, she was speechless.<br><br>...<br><br>They&#39;d very much moved on to flirting now, much to Jacques&#39; relief. He had to give her credit, though--she was still asking questions, even if most of them seemed to be part of her flirting style. It was suddenly a little bit charming, that her work had permeated even this aspect of her life so well.<br><br>&quot;You seduce so many people,&quot; she was purring now. Her hand was on his arm, but despite the calculating undertone to her voice, her eyes were fixed on his. &quot;Is it always a split second decision, or are there people you wait on seducing?&quot;<br><br>He pulled back a little, laughing quietly. &quot;You know, I don&#39;t seduce <i>everyone</i> I meet. Some of them aren&#39;t interested, for one thing, and, well...I do have people I&#39;ve known for five years, practically the whole time I&#39;ve been here, who I&#39;ve never really gone for. You know how it is.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Of course,&quot; she said. &quot;Five years, though? What&#39;s kept you from trying?&quot;<br><br>Jacques shrugged. &quot;Apart from people I just don&#39;t have a chance with, or who turned me down the second I offered? I...&quot; He paused, thinking about it. If this made it into her article, he thought he could take it--it could even serve as a reminder to him, at certain moments. &quot;It wouldn&#39;t have worked, I guess. The time wasn&#39;t right, for both of us. It would&#39;ve been a disaster, and then we settled into friendship, and...&quot; He shrugged. &quot;I suppose it might happen someday, but I&#39;m not holding my breath.&quot;<br><br>Had she even heard all of that? Her eyes had dropped to his mouth halfway through. He&#39;d be impressed if she&#39;d caught most of it.<br><br>He leaned forward, returning the favor and adopting his flirtiest tone. &quot;Did you catch any of that?&quot;<br><br>&quot;What?&quot; She looked up, and actually <i>blushed</i>. He hadn&#39;t expected that.<br><br>He reached out a hand, brushing his fingers over the red in her cheeks. &quot;Never mind.&quot;<br><br>&quot;When did you decide to seduce me?&quot; she blurted. Uncomposed words from a very composed woman--he loved it. That and the way she was <i>still</i> asking questions.<br><br>&quot;About five minutes after you started talking to me,&quot; he said, grinning. No need to add that the decision had been based partially on distracting her, since brushing her off hadn&#39;t worked. It wasn&#39;t like he objected to the impending outcome, anyway. He leaned in, skimming his hands up her arms to cup her face, and lowered his voice. &quot;Tell me, lovely Rita...have I managed it yet?&quot;<br><br>She kissed him. He wanted to laugh triumphantly; instead, he wrapped his arms around her and set about kissing her breathless.<br><br>(He was, in fact, careful not to disturb her hair. He wasn&#39;t sure if he <i>could</i>, or how she could possibly get it looking presentable again to begin with.<br><br>After all, he still wanted her good will, even if that was quickly taking second place to everything else.)<br><br>--<br><br>So--kernels of truth, some polishing of lines, some changing of them altogether, and quite a bit of attraction. And, y&#39;know, romance novel narration.<br><br>As to being Ana Steele...not enough inner goddesses and subconsciouses :P And I regret to inform you that she went into publishing, though actually the series does open with her filling in for her journalist best friend on an interview, because <i>obviously</i> it can&#39;t be rescheduled or given to <i>an actual other student journalist</i> rather than this random...English major, possibly.<br><br>(Though, also, Ana&#39;s not nearly interesting enough to be Rita Skeeter. Rita may be awful, but at least she isn&#39;t bland.)<br><br>--<br><br>Anyway. Glad you liked it! :) I&#39;m not sure if there&#39;ll be any more, since I have a fair bit of schoolwork to get done (did this on a food break), but we&#39;ll see. If I get time and inclination before this thread falls off the page, I might go for it.<br><br>~Z</p>

            <p>I mean, what else do I say? That was outstandingly funny.

            <p>Aw, drat, I messed up the image. I did intend for her to be reacting to that picture, because that guy is a) not Thoth glistening with oil, and b) just weird-looking.

Like, <a href="https://goo.gl/images/5csbS1">this one</a> and <a href="https://goo.gl/images/8ji3PJ">this one</a> are pretty similar to the one you used, but are much more reasonable without being really good-looking. <a href="https://goo.gl/images/FehG3S">This one</a> seems to be more or less canon?<br><br>I like the effect used for the black carapace in <a href="https://goo.gl/images/otB7uZ">this one</a>, but that guy is not nearly built enough to be an Astartes.<br><br>And then there&#39;s <a href="https://goo.gl/images/ZFkFLv">this guy</a>. I don&#39;t even know about this guy. This may be what happens when you really want to make a guy pretty but annoying people keep telling you he&#39;s not supposed to be, so you get base prettiness with superficial grit layered on top. It doesn&#39;t quite hide the prettiness. It just looks like his right eye (audience left) is trying to escape.<br><br>ANYWAY! Glad you enjoyed. ^_^<br><br>And yes, Gall does have a warped mind.

            <p>That image is deliberately kinda awful, judt to be clear (that is, it was the first kinda awful/sorta accurate image I could find).

            <p>Tabloids are a guilty pleasure of mine, not because I believe what they tell me but because I like to laugh at how ridiculous some of the claims are. This didn&#39;t disappoint!

            <p>Now I have to ask: is this a new (fourth) <i>Monitor</i>, or have the unnamed reporters joined Starwind and Eledhwen on the &#39;REAL Multiverse Monitor&#39;? It surely can&#39;t be the third version, which had aspirations towards actual standards. ^_^<br><br>(I&#39;m hoping for a Fourth Monitor; it&#39;ll give Starwind and Eledhwen a chance to rant about being the &#39;REAL Real Multiverse Monitor&#39;. :D)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>It&#39;s close to S&amp;E Monitor in style, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s quite the right fit for it. Being, as it was, inspired by my half-remembered maybe-reading of the S&amp;E Monitor a very long time ago, about a page and a half of the National Enquirer (as much as I could read before my eyes started to smoke), my own twisted and extremely dirty mind, and Geema giving immoral support from the sidelines.<br><br>So, since it&#39;s a new incarnation of the Multiverse Monitor, the question is this: who&#39;s in charge? I asked the Multiverse Monitor and got this statement back.<br><br><blockquote>
<br>WHO WE ARE AND WHY WE DO WHAT WE DO.<br>We here at the Multiverse Monitor are an elite team of journalists, dedicated to providing HQ with premium Multiverse Monitor content. As to how we were formed, there are several theories, one of which is that HQ is so warped that the rules of consensus reality can apply. That is to say, because a large group of agents more or less believe that there is a an organization called the Multiverse Monitor somewhere, publishing a magazine of dubious repute, the organization and the magazine have come into being, a sort of real-life amalgamation of the vision of the collective unconscious.<br><br>We accept payments in most currencies.<br>
</blockquote>
<br><br>As always, consider the source before deciding whether or not that&#39;s anything other than absolute hogwash. Protip: It&#39;s from the Multiverse Monitor.</p>
