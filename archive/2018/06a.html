            <p>You may or may not have heard that a ROM of the 1997 demo/prototype version of Pokemon Gold &amp; Silver - AKA Generation II - has recently come to light (I first ran into it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-05-31-pokemon-designs-leak-from-gold-and-silver-demo">here</a>, but there&#39;s loads of articles about it). A group on The Internet has been working on it, and they&#39;ve extracted data on all the Pokemon included.<br><br>Assuming <a href="https://tcrf.net/Proto:Pok%C3%A9mon_Gold_and_Silver">The Cutting Room Floor</a> can be trusted (I don&#39;t know the first thing about them), it turns out that the new Pokedex for Gen II was very much in a state of flux. Of the 100 new Pokemon added in the games, at least <b>60</b> were substantially different from their final forms.<br><br>As it happens, a) I&#39;m a saddo geek, and b) I found someone who had provided colour sprites for the entire Proto-Johto Pokedex. So here they are! The original Johto starters, the weirdly different Pokemon you already know, the babies and evolutions from Kanto that never made it in, and the entirely new critters!<br><br>(Names in &quot;quotes&quot; are created by the TCRF team from the Japanese text; names without are actual Pokemon names.)<br><br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/Uf5Zmah.png"><br><br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/K5oFCc9.png"><br><br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/UgyWVl3.png"><br><br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/A4gIQlw.png"><br><br>It&#39;s also worth a note that Umbreon was originally Poison-type, though it looked pretty much the same.<br><br>With all these new Pokemon (including <b>18</b> more Gen I evolutions!), but only 100 total, that means there&#39;s a whole heap of familiar Pokemon who got left out. As far as I can tell, this is the complete list (all 38 of them):<br><br>Cyndaquil/Quilava/Typhlosion, Totdile/Croconaw/Feraligatr, Sentret/Furret, Chinchou/Lanturn, Wooper, Togetic, Bellossom, Azumarill, Sudowoodo, Sunkern (though Sunflora is there), Yanma, Misdreavus, Pineco/Forretress, Dunsparce, Gligar, Granbull, Shuckle, Heracross, Teddiursa/Ursaring, Slugma/Magcargo, Swinup/Piloswine, Corsola, Stantler, Smeargle, Larvitar/Pupitar/Tyranitar, Lugia, Celebi<br><br>Anyone who isn&#39;t in the list or one of the pictures made it through unscathed - so that&#39;s good news for fans of Skarmory, Ho-oh, and Natu!<br><br>So who&#39;s <i>your</i> favourite? I admit to being quite partial to Goofy Pichu, and Meowsy (Baby Meowth) is just <i>adorable</i>, but I think the top of my list has to be Anchorage. It&#39;s a shark - but it&#39;s also an anchor! And if its name is anything to go by, it&#39;s a seething ball of fury (probably because it can&#39;t swim because <i>its tail is an anchor</i>). Amazing.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Oh, hey, it&#39;s my main source of video game nostalgia!<br><br>It&#39;s easy to see why they switched Blossomole&#39;s design.  It really looks nothing like the rest of the family.  Interesting that its name references moles, since most people seem to consider that line apatasaurs of some stripe.<br><br>The Flambear&#39;s family is basically just &quot;bears, but on fire,&quot; so I&#39;m glad they switched to an animal line that fit the fire into the real world biology more cleverly.  These bears designs are pretty dull.<br><br>I&#39;m not sure if the Cruz family is meant to be pinnepeds or plesiosaurs/Loch Ness creatures.  If plesiosaurs, I can understand the change to keep Typhlosion/Dynabear from being the only non-ancient organism in the fully evolved starters.  Cruz and friends look all right, though, so I&#39;m surprised they didn&#39;t get revisited in a later generation.<br><br>There seems to have been a mix-up.  Why was the objectively inferior Noctowl design published in the final game?  Might be because they felt this unused design would look Dark-type, and wanted to communicate its actual Normal-type better, especially in the games that introduced Dark.  It still saddens me, though.<br><br>I don&#39;t see why the manta ray used to look like a bird.  That&#39;s weird.  Unless it wasn&#39;t a manta originally?<br><br>Old Pichu is definitely dumber looking than actual Pichu.  Although maybe <i>Super Smash Bros. Melee</i> would have gotten a different character in that slot, since this version of Pichu looks like it can barely move its limbs?    I actually like the Cleffa and Igglybuff designs, though.  Cleffa communicates the hinted alien nature of its line better with that antenna, and the published Igglybuff design always looked too busy to me, with that huge poof of hair.  A perfect sphere is a much better starting point for the Balloon family.<br><br>I was always bothered that Politoed strayed so far from the rest of its family, so I think I would have liked this version better.<br><br>At least we finally know why Ledian is the &quot;Five Star&quot; Pok√©mon.  I can see why they changed it, though; it does just look like &quot;angrier Ledyba.&quot;<br><br>I don&#39;t know why Remoraid is weirdly fat, but I love the older Octillery!  It communicates the design intent so much better, and matches the name.<br><br>I like Tyrogue better here, too.  The actual design is such a generic anime aesthetic, but this little fellow has elements of both Hitmonchan and Hitmonlee, and maybe Hitmontop too, if I squint.<br><br>Skiploom, Elekid, Blissey and Kingdra could have worked as shown here, though I do like the final Elekid design better.<br><br>I guess the joke with Porygon2 is that it switched from rigid to round?  Weird that it goes from duck-like to lion-like, though.<br><br>Ugh.  The legendary beasts look like they were designed by a preteen boy on deviantART trying to be edgy.  Vastly inferior to the final versions.<br><br>I know it&#39;s just coincidence that they&#39;ve wound up next to each other, but it gives the impression that Sneasel traded the Normal type to Aipom for its Dark typing before the final release.<br><br>Gosh.  I like Tangela&#39;s family members, but a lot of the others here are pretty uninteresting.  &quot;Grimer but smaller,&quot; &quot;Vulpix with fewer tails,&quot; &quot;baby Goldeen but it&#39;s Seaking instead,&quot; &quot;baby Doduo except it has three heads like Dodrio so where does the third head disappear to during the Doduo stage,&quot; and &quot;Ditto with teeth&quot; are not winners in my book.  I&#39;m glad most of those got scrapped.<br><br>I guess Quilfish was originally Electric-type, or gained it when evolving?  Maybe the Qwilfish and Chinchou lines started as a single concept, and got separated later.  I actually like the Farfetch&#39;d evolution, and I think I like this Leafeon a bit better than the one we got in Generation 4.  It fits in with the original three designs better, I think.<br><br>For the &quot;new&quot; set, I particularly like the Bombseel, Kurstraw, Wolfman and Sunmola families.  It also makes a weird kind of sense that Girafarig was originally Dark rather than Psychic.  Maybe it was too good against Ghost-types?  But then, there were only two Ghost-type families back then (three if we count Kurstraw).  I&#39;m also confused how Turbann would work in relation to Slowpoke, but maybe there was no mechanical interaction, and it was just world building to have the mollusk also around.<br><br>‚Äîdoctorlit, out of time</p>

            <p>Whatever happened to Noctowl, ay? Look at that! It looks like a Hoothoot underwent a sort of evolutionary process, rather than just, er, turning into a regular owl! <br><br>And Animon looks <i>insane</i>. Looks like it&#39;s going to rocket off into space. Bloody awesome. <br><br>Also, early Mantine looks so coool. I can&#39;t remember what particular creature it resembles, but it&#39;s not depicted very much anywhere at all. Kinda reminds me of that whole Sea Monk thing - that fish they found ages what looked like a monk, and that they got sorta religious and such over. <br><br>And, phew, Kurstraw. Man that&#39;s a cool design. I guess they sorta got that thing later on, with Banette and so on, ay? The ghost doll deal. Still, it looks pretty distinct and cool on its own. <br><br>Aaah, they&#39;re cool. I don&#39;t even care if they&#39;re fake - they&#39;re proper cool looking. </p>

            <p>So, it&#39;s been about two months since <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=314986;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board"> I got ekected as a Mod</a> for the Discord.

            <p>Hypothetical questions about interpreting canon:<br><br>1. Is there a way for a canon character to be against the existence of the PPC, whether from their opinions or being convinced so by someone other than a Mary Sue? Could some canon villains who get portrayed as heroes a lot like that fact and thus generally like badfic? Could someone whose motivations include creating a perfect being/race be ticked off by the fact that those pesky agents manage to destroy all the Suefics starring a success at that endeavor? Or at least, could someone who doesn&#39;t have an Aura of Smooth convince them of this?<br><br>2. What does one do if very little or no personality is shown in a canon for given character? How would that affect what&#39;s &quot;canon&quot; with regards to their personality, and how should they be portrayed as true to canon as possible/when not OOC in a PPC fic?<br><br>And the simple question:<br><br>3. Is there any good reference source with regards to hS&#39;s PPC video game? For next Badfic Games, I&#39;m planning on writing a glitched copy cruddypasta of it, so I&#39;d like to know how the game actually goes and such.

            <p>When you brought up villains being portrayed as heroes, my mind immediately went to Loki. Characters of his type (not villains, per se, but incredibly adaptable trolls) would probably be amused to no end by a lot of badfic. If they were more or less in their right mind they would probably try to take advantage of the situation.<br><br>Not that I imagine Loki particularly would have many opportunities to do this, because he tends to be one of the most butchered characters I&#39;ve seen in MCU fanfic. I think his opinion of his portrayals in fanfic would range from amusement to anger, depending on the particular portrayal.<br><br>Loki doesn&#39;t think of himself as a villain, and neither do a lot of fanfic writers. Fundamentally we see agreement, but the problem arises when you look at the way the fanwriters tend to defend him, which more often than not is portraying him as weak, or more victimized than he was in canon. I don&#39;t think Loki would appreciate that.<br><br>And I also think he wouldn&#39;t much like any fanfic that had him too far out of character. Fundamentally Loki and most other villains like who they are. Seeing someone twist their personality to the point most badfics go to would probably <i>not</i> make them happy.<br><br>Besides, I&#39;ve seen a fair amount of <i>goodfic</i> that&#39;s managed to portray villains as good guys to at least some extent. If it can be done well, there&#39;s no need for them to approve of it being done badly.<br><br>TL;DR: Using Loki as an example, I think that it&#39;s unlikely that badfic interpretations of villains as good guys would please the villains much, since it usually involves some warping of character. Also I&#39;ve seen that done well, so there&#39;s no real use to doing it badly.</p>

<li>It&#39;s possible for a canon character to hold any opinion they might canonically hold. Any canon character who would agree that mind-controlling people against their will in order to make them more like what you want them to be might think of a &#39;Sue as working toward their own ends. However, such characters almost always don&#39;t want their own minds tampered with; so once the &#39;Sue pulls them out of character, they tend to be pretty annoyed once they come to their senses. Of course, they would need to be aware of the PPC, either temporarily or permanently, in order to have any opinion at all.<br><br>Since badfic usually ruins characterization even when it attempts to perfect a species, most mind-controlling canon villains would actually see the &#39;Sue&#39;s efforts as an amateur, horribly executed attempt at doing what they&#39;ve been trying to do.<br><br>2. Imagine covering up a photograph, and poking a hole in the cover. Anyone trying to recreate the photograph from just what they can see through the hole can do whatever they want with the covered-up parts, but their guess needs to be consistent with what&#39;s visible.<br><br>Depending on how complex a character is, they may be a Generic, a bit, a minor character or a major character. If they&#39;re in-character, whatever you can see of them will be consistent with what you saw about them in canon--even if canon doesn&#39;t explicitly state those parts.<br><br>In the PPC, many agents started out as bit characters or minor characters whose personalities were not completely determined when they joined the PPC. Gaining a personality can be part of these agents&#39; stories. I&#39;ve never written any missions, but I did create an agent, Jane Doe. She started out with practically no personality except for &quot;Generic Tolkien Dwarf&quot;, and over her introduction gained only a love for coffee and a tendency to pay attention to details. Luckily, Jane Doe comes from a strong canon with a well-defined species, so she has a lot to build from.<br><br>Bit characters and minor characters gain their three-dimensionality from the canon they come from. If the canon is strong, they&#39;re fully-realized people who simply aren&#39;t very visible. If the canon is weak--as a badfic storyline is--they can even be completely non-sentient, unable to do anything but stand there unless the fic tells them to do something.<br><br>What your agent does with them depends on how much they take from the host canon and how much they take from the fanfic.<br><br>Bits and minor characters relatively unaffected by the fanfic can be allowed to assimilate into the canon, optionally after some kind of memory modification, and live as fully-realized people.<br><br>Bits and minor characters strongly associated to the fanfic but without any real characterization will generally poof out of existence along with the non-canon furniture when the biggest canon breaks are fixed.<br><br>Minor characters strongly associated with the fanfic but with too much characterization to disappear or assimilate on their own have to be removed. Options include assassination, relocation to a more appropriate canon, or recruitment.</li>

            <p>The PPC tries to keep themselves secret. Most of the time, the canons are ignorant. But some canons know.<br><br>1. Omnipotent/omniscient deities who can be expected to have knowledge of the full multiverse know without having to find out. Aslan, Illuvatar, and Madoka have been established to know of the PPC. Omnipotent/omniscient deities tend to be hands-off and to care about the free will, but will occasionally step in when they have been maligned directly.<br><br>2. Very powerful characters, though not omniscient, are more likely to find out. Death from Discworld is aware of the PPC; so is Father Christmas from Narnia and Ponch from Young Wizards. They tend to be the type not to interfere with agents&#39; work, and to be quite cordial when encountered.<br><br>3. Characters who are insane enough to see through SEP fields and perceive the multiverse. Discworld&#39;s Altogether Andrews has one or more personalities that know about the PPC. The A-Team&#39;s Murdock has managed to retain vague memories between neuralyzations, probably because of his unusually flexible mind, but seems content to stay within his own world. Characters whose mental illness or insanity or strange outlook lets them see the PPC tend to also be pretty accepting of the PPC&#39;s presence, since it&#39;s no more odd than any other part of their lives, and are unlikely to be believed by other canons in any case.<br><br>4. Characters who are very, very good at analysis, to the point that they can detect tiny clues that the agents left behind before the canon snaps back. So far the only character in this category is Sherlock Holmes, who has on a few occasions figured out that something odd is going on. The more in-character he is, the more likely he is to use his detective abilities to suss out the PPC. Luckily, the closer to IC he is, the more likely he is to be fighting the Suefluence and to recognize the PPC as allies. He is usually neuralyzed at the end of a mission, but because of his abilities, is likely to figure it out all over again.<br><br>5. Characters who live in a metafictional continuum and can recognize the PPC as multiverse travelers. In this category: The characters in Gorillaz and the Doctor&#39;s TARDIS. Characters like Deadpool and the inhabitants of the Thursday Next continuum are likely to figure it out, too, but this hasn&#39;t yet been observed.<br><br>6. Gaspode and other minor characters who are both very perceptive and very easily overlooked. When they repeatedly see the PPC fix problems in their continuua, and the agents forget to wipe their memories because they&#39;re so forgettable, they may become allies. Gaspode from Discworld was the first, and can be expected to help agents. Luckily his awareness doesn&#39;t harm his home continuum because he canonically knows a whole lot more than he tells.<br><br>7. 1984&#39;s Big Brother, who was directly clued in by a rogue PPC agent. Unfortunately, Big Brother could be anything from a figurehead to a concept to an icon of the government of Oceania--he may not be a person at all. Luckily, 1984&#39;s technology is stuck at the 1950s Earth level thanks to constant warfare and a repressive government, and he&#39;s unlikely to ever make his way out of his own world. That does, unfortunately, mean that any agents doing a mission in 1984 have to stay constantly disguised and in character, making sure to use their technology only when they are not on camera. Whether Big Brother wants to steal PPC technology or actually invade the multiverse is unknown, but the PPC isn&#39;t keen to find out. Luckily 1984 badfics are rare.</p>

            <p>Or species? That strikes me as more accurate. Also, probably replace &#39;new&#39; with &#39;old&#39;. Very old. <br><br>Anyhow! <br><br>Have you fellows heard of the <a href="http://www.gods-and-monsters.com/cynocephalus.html%20">Cynocephalus?</a><br><br>Ancient Greek furries. <br>But, actually, I&#39;m really surprised I&#39;ve never seen <i>any</i> mention of these chaps in any media anywhere. You don&#39;t even need to worldbuild, because Greek physician, Ctesias, seems to have already done it: <br><br><i>&#39;They speak no language, but bark like dogs, and in this manner make themselves understood by each other. Their teeth are larger than those of dogs, their nails like those of these animals, but longer and rounder. They inhabit the mountains as far as the river Indus. Their complexion is swarthy. They are extremely just, like the rest of the Indians with whom they associate. They understand the Indian language but are unable to converse, only barking or making signs with their hands and fingers by way of reply... They live on raw meat. They number about 120,000.&#39;</i><br><br>And it goes wayy further on than that, too, where he details their general mode of life - hunters who keep sheep, goats, and so on, along with dried &#39;<i>fruit of Siptakhora</i>&#39; (I haven&#39;t a clue what this fruit might actually be.) <br>They send the sweet amber of this fruit, the fruit itself, purple flowers, and purple dye, to the king of India, and then trade the rest of it with other Indians for food and weaponry. The king, every five years, sends them a present of <i>heaps</i> of weapons - 300,000 bows and spears, 120,000 shields, 50,000. They could probably also bite you with their dog-teeth. They supposedly lived around India and North Africa, and places in between. <br><br>He describes them as being good with bows and spears, and, generally living in &#39;<i>lofty and inaccessible mountains</i>&#39;, outright calls them undefeatable in war. <br><br>They seem to be a kind of hunter-gatherer society kind of deal, living in caves, outright chasing their prey down and overtaking it, sleeping on leaves and grass and so on. Only their women bathe, and only once a month. The men just sorta stink. <br>They wear tanned and fine skins except the few rich, who wear linen. <br>Apparently they live pretty long, too - up to 200 years. <br><br>He emphasises a lot that they&#39;re quite just, and, well, they seem pretty chill, ay? In the face of the barking and raw meat eating, they seem to fiddle around a lot with sweet fruits and flowers and dyes. In fact, one of them supposedly became a Saint - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Christopher#Depictions_in_art">Saint Christopher!</a> One of the theories is that Saint Christopher was depicted as a dog-headed chap due to a language misinterpretation - <i>Cananeus</i> (as in, Canaanite) misinterpreted as <i>canineus</i> - y&#39;know, dog. People took this depiction and ran with it and now everyone reckons he&#39;s a dog-guy. <br><br>Marco Polo has also sighted them, in which they are depicted in a less positive light: &#39;<i>they are a most cruel generation, and eat everybody that they can catch, if not of their own race.</i>&#39; <br>This sighting took place on the island of Angamanain, thought to be part of the now Andaman Islands - which are around India. <br>Perhaps these chaps Marco saw were a sort of nastier, distant tribe, long ago branched off from the fellows Ctesias saw, ay? Or maybe Marco was just really racist. Maybe they&#39;re just not real at all, but that&#39;s a bit boring, innit? <br><br>Anyhows, they are <i>gone</i> nowadays, both physically and in media. Which is a shame, because I&#39;d certainly be a whole lot more into a race of just dog-headed hunter-gatherers who live in mountain caves and who have mean island cousins than the old elves and dwarves! <br><br>What do you lot think? Are there any other old, weird races and species that just don&#39;t seem to appear in any fantasy or anything at all, when they really probably ought to? </p>

            <p>I wish that a lot of the more popular old mythology races/species would be portrayed closer to the original myths. Not to mention the old gods. Have you noticed how in so many movies, ancient gods of death (Hades, Hela, etc) are always portrayed as evil and wanting to take over everything? When in fact, if you look at the myths that some of these death gods came from, many of them are just fine where they are ruling the dead. This is likely because a lot of these ancient cultures had a less &quot;scary&quot; view of death than the modern Western version. I don&#39;t know exactly why this is, as many mythologies had the same judgement-based placement of their dead that Christianity does, but I remember for a fact that neither Hades nor Hela wanted to overthrow everything until Percy Jackson, Disney, and Marvel came along and put a Hollywood spin on things. (Not saying that these continua aren&#39;t good, in fact, I love Rick Riordan&#39;s stuff so much. Just saying that they do something kind of cliche with portrayal of death gods.)<br><br>-Twistey</p>

            <p>I was in a class on corpses in theater last semester, and something we ended up talking about was the switch, in Europe, from death as a commonplace and rather public occurrence to the current Western conception of death as something private and associated with shame. I wonder if death being less a part of everyday life makes it more frightening and contributes to the trend of ‚Äúevil‚Äù gods of death.</p>

            <p>Yes, I agree! Writing death gods as mustache-twirling villains is pretty boring.<br><br>Here&#39;s an example of a non-villainous death god, from the D&amp;D game I&#39;m currently playing:<br><br>The Voice of Life and Death is an integral part of the universe who probably came into being when souls were created--or maybe she created souls; it&#39;s hard to tell. She&#39;s the one who maintains the cycle of reincarnation and determines when a soul is ready to pass on to the next world. Very occasionally, someone manages to get an audience with her, mostly to beg for the life of a loved one; she grants these requests sometimes, but only if she really thinks you have a good argument.<br><br>She cares about the world and its existence, and cares about keeping order between life and death. She doesn&#39;t mind necromancy, for the most part--creating zombies is fine in her book, since it doesn&#39;t mess with anybody&#39;s soul--but the second you interfere with the cycle of reincarnation, you&#39;re on her shit list. This is why necromancers who do experiment on souls often try to achieve immortality--they don&#39;t want to be anywhere near the Voice when she is riled up about their twisted experiments.<br><br>Nowadays, she presents as a middle-aged, heavyset black woman who is fond of tea and cookies and tries to sneak some reading in between souls. She hasn&#39;t always been female, though; she&#39;s been male, androgynous, or even an entirely bodiless force, and she&#39;s been known to change depending on who&#39;s looking at her.<br><br>Her clerics are midwives, doctors, morticians, and occasionally serial killers, though the latter don&#39;t seem to last long and she treats them more like annoying fanboys than serious followers, and soon sends them on to the next life, hoping they&#39;ll grow out of their immaturity. The Voice sees death as a normal part of life, but doesn&#39;t like it when the decisions of mortals force someone to die before their time. She dislikes war, partly because it causes so many untimely deaths and partly because it swamps her with work, which always makes her irritable.</p>

            <p>There&#39;s one where it&#39;s this lady - Frau Perchta. She&#39;s an Eastern European figure and in fitting with Eastern European things she is horrifying and depressing. Her descriptions vary - in some cases she&#39;s a beast, in others, just a tall woman. Sometimes she has literally two faces.<br>To the good kids she&#39;d leave silver in their shoes. To the bad kids, she&#39;d, er, cut them open and replace their innards with pebbles and straw. And take their innards. <br><br>There&#39;s also the Icelandic Yule cat, who eats ya if you haven&#39;t gotten new clothes for Christmas. Farmers used this as incentive to get their workers to work, because if they didn&#39;t, they&#39;d get no clothes gifted, and they&#39;d get eaten by a giant cat. <br><br>Also Santa in the Netherlands has a sidekick in blackface with him. <br><br>But, uh, otherwise, Santa himself is usually the benign figure. In his most dire cases he has a Krampus sorta figure with him to do the dirty work. Like that guy in blackface. He&#39;s the evil one. <br>Phew. <br><br>Meeeerry Christmaaaas! </p>

            <p>The Hades sequence is one of my favourite parts of that book, and it&#39;s a good book!<br><br>... <i>why</i> has it been four years since the last Dresden book?

The challenger bet that Butcher could not write a good story based on a lame idea, and he countered that he could do it using two lame ideas of the challenger&#39;s choosing.

            <p>The human relationship with death is a <i>deeply</i> fascinating one, innit? There&#39;s not a culture on the world that doesn&#39;t tackle the issue, and it forms a pretty central pillar in pretty much every personal philosophy out there, ay? I mean, even the entire concept of human meaning kinda ties into it! What&#39;s after it, after all? <br><br>Which is why I&#39;m always disappointed when the villain of something is some cackling git deathgod, and am always really excited whenever someone does something new with them. <br>Pratchett&#39;s take on it, for instance. I haven&#39;t even read his Discworld series on Death, but I love the guy. And his appearance in Good Omens, too, was damn good fun. </p>

            <p>to sort of see that kind of necromancy in large scale warfare. The sort of context where it&#39;s literally just their culture and how they do wars - just enlist every dead person ever (whether they like it or not) and send them out in a huge army and wall themselves in. I figure you&#39;d just end up with a situation where they&#39;re just locked inside forever and there&#39;s a war going on outside forever, all the plants and so on crushed into mud. Even if all the dead people all together went on strike and all left for greener pastures they&#39;d just stay locked up, assuming it&#39;s still warring out there. <br><br>There&#39;s a lot of room for dark comedy and satire in there, anyways.

            <p>Because a big part of what made Discworld great and special and all that is the humanization of the inhuman. Death (not death, but Death) is a product of humanity, so he is very human. So&#39;s... well, everyone. Dwarves and Trolls think differently, but they&#39;re still people. Thief of Time showed us how little it took to humanize the most inhuman characters of the lot.<br><br>Death is the emblem of that. He&#39;s also one of Discworld&#39;s finest characters.</p>

            <p>Do you happen to have read that book? It&#39;s probably one of the only World War II books I&#39;ve ever liked, in terms of actual stories, informational texts, and historical fiction. The third is often edged to death, at least judging by the covers I saw before I was too turned off to start reading, and honestly, so is the second kind, in terms of the things that the authors choose for your content. You get a lot of books titled &quot;Hitler&#39;s _______,&quot; and it gets old. The Book Thief manages to hit the right balance: neither grimdarking the subject nor trivializing it.<br><br>But anyway, back from that tangent, another interesting thing about The Book Thief is that Death is portrayed as a deep sympathetic character, and even narrates the entire book. Highly recommend.<br><br>Or if you&#39;ve read it, nice!<br><br>-Twistey</p>

Robot Wars is The Best One and you will never convince me otherwise. So here&#39;s a thing.<br><br>There&#39;s a live circuit in the British robot combat scene. Basically, an arena turns up in a shipping container, is quickly bolted together in a sports hall, seating is arranged, and you get a shedload of robots beating the scrap out of each other. Then it goes somewhere else. Usually, they go to only the most exotic locales, such as Colchester, or Guildford. However, they&#39;re coming near me quite soon.<br><br>If people are willing to trek over to Maidstone on Sunday 28th October (it&#39;s about an hour on the train from London), there will be a live showing of Extreme Robots! at 12:00. Tickets for the event are around ¬£20 a person. I&#39;m going. Mel is going. Ix is going. I think all three of us would love to see whoever else shows up too. =]<br><br>So yeah! The show is ca. two hours long with a break in the middle, so afterwards we could explore the interesting things to do in Maidstone, which I am reliably informed numbers in at least the positives. Most of the time. Who&#39;s up for that? =]</p>

            <p><b>Disclaimer</b>: This isn&#39;t a review. Or a formal anything. It IS what some of you may be accustomed to already, my standard long-form ramble. Don&#39;t have any expectations, and you won&#39;t be disappointed. I&#39;ll try to keep it mostly spoiler free, but beyond that... yeah.<br><br>So I&#39;ve been reading Pern. A LOT of Pern. I&#39;ve read 10 books, going on 11, and I&#39;ve barely read anything else, save for going through <i>Gates of Fire</i>.<br><br>Pern&#39;s been on my reading list for a while, being generally highly regarded in sci-fi circles and extremely prominent in early online roleplaying (because fanfic was banned for so long, and hey, all that pent-up fandom energy had to go <i>somewhere</i>... and go it did). Props should go to Neshomeh for finally actually getting me to pick up the sodding thing. If you&#39;ve been paying attention and didn&#39;t know all this already, this probably makes sense.<br><br>On to thoughts.<br><br>Pern has aged. Like, right off the bat. This isn&#39;t necessarily <i>bad</i>, but I don&#39;t think Pern would have been written today. If it was, it certainly wouldn&#39;t have the same renown or impact. It&#39;s soft SF, although it feels an awful lot like hard fantasy at times. It feels like it&#39;s out of the 1960s (which it is), from the silvery spacecraft in later novels to the clear influence from the Sexual Revolution and Feminism of that time that pervades the series (but I&#39;m not going to go into detail about either sexism or feminism in Pern, partly because I&#39;m not especially qualified, but mainly because we&#39;ll be here all day: suffice to say, Pern aged somewhat badly in a few respects and Anne McCaffrey had some weird views in others, but it didn&#39;t age nearly as bad as some other novels from the same era. If you&#39;ve read Pern, you know what I mean). But it&#39;s not just that. Pern has a perpetual air of optimism about it that was still common at the time in SF. If I had to pick an in-any-way recent song to epitomize it, the song would be <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=163_C5UVU-I">this one</a>. And there&#39;s just... a feel of datedness in about the whole thing. &quot;Rescue Run&quot; from <i>Chronicles of Pern: The First Fall</i> feels like it&#39;s right out Star Trek, for crying out loud.<br><br>However, it&#39;s mostly aged pretty well. Aside a few... well, questionable aspects. Really questionable aspects. But I&#39;m focusing on the positive, dangit. The McCaffrey-is-bad-at-romance discussion, and the greenriders-oh-god-what-were-you-thinking rant can both happen later. Besides, this began in the 60s: it could have been so much worse.<br><br>Bored now, onto other subjects! Let&#39;s take it book by book, at least until I get bored.<br><br><b>Dragonflight</b><br><br><i>Dragonflight</i>... isn&#39;t a novel. It&#39;s a collection of short stories pretending to a novel (they might have been revised a bit for the &quot;novel&quot;, but... well, not enough). And... jeez. Did &quot;Weyr Search&quot; really win an award when it was published? It&#39;s... kinda not all that great. Full of clunky phrasing, and writing that... isn&#39;t that great. I mean, the concept&#39;s strong, but.. Well, it won a Hugo, so what do I know? This also marks Pern&#39;s long association with <i>Analog Science Fiction and Fact</i>, which would publish a number of Pern&#39;s short stories over the years. Indeed John W. Campbell (Noted science fiction author and editor, as well as noted racist and awful person) had a strong influence on the series, making several crucial suggestions to McCaffrey. Namely... well, uh... how not to spoil it... The Thing That Lessa Works Out And Then Does. That was his suggestion, at least in part.<br><br>Anyways, the book&#39;s composition as a group of short stories is readily noticeable in a number of respects. For one, the writing jumps in quality at each section break. By the end, I&#39;d actually say it&#39;s pretty good. Although the last part is also the most engaging, so that might be part of it... Still, this is probably the worst Pern novel, by far: our protagonists and major characters feel a bit off (F&#39;lar and Lessa are both far less likeable here than they are in later novels, &quot;Dragonrider&quot; in particular showing F&#39;lar being not just unlikeable but a highly questionable level of stupid‚Äîand his plan almost goes up in smoke because of it). The book also has a few major elements that just outright don&#39;t appear in future books, or are significantly changed: Lytol&#39;s dragon, for one, but far more major is the greater emphasis on telepathy and psychic ability. Never again, to my recollection, is a character shown to be able to directly manipulate another&#39;s thoughts in canon. Although I may be wrong.<br><br><b>Dragonquest</b><br><br>Holy hell. Just going over all the stuff that happened in this book... phew. It&#39;s HUGE. This is book where Pern really came into its own in a number of respects. Our characters feel better developed and more solid, the writing&#39;s a lot more consistent and solid, the romance that is here feels less forced and creepy (although creepy romance is kinda just... part of the thing. McCaffrey doesn&#39;t do good romance, IMHO). It also set expectations going forward, telling us that <i>no</i>, Pern wasn&#39;t going to stay still, that change would be an omnipresent part of the setting.<br><br>Not a whole not else to say, really. Not unless I want to talk about Greenriders, and... I don&#39;t. I&#39;m too tired for that. Besides, we to the really salient point next. Which is...<br><br><b>The Harper Hall Trilogy</b><br><br>Okay, there&#39;s something I need to get off my chest.<br><br>All three Harper Hall novels are <i>excellent</i>. You should go read them. Sadly, you have to read <i>Dragonflight</i> and <i>Dragonquest</i> first, but don&#39;t let that dissuade you. It&#39;s great.<br><br>If <i>Dragonquest</i> cemented the skeleton of Pern, then it&#39;s Harper Hall that gave Pern its soul. Firstly, they were really the first Pern novels to look at Pern from the perspective of someone other than a dragonrider. They fleshed out the world a heck of a lot as a result. But they also gave us a glimpse at the Harpers, and just...<br><br>Okay. there are some feelings that are hard to fake. One is enthusiasm. It&#39;s really hard to pretend to be excited about something when you&#39;re not. By contrast, if you love something, that love and enthusiasm tends to show in your work.<br><br>And in Harper Hall, it is <i>incredibly</i> clear that McCaffrey loves music just as much as the characters. Moreso in Dragonsong and Dragonsinger than Dragondrums, which is a bit of a different beast, but still. Not to mention all the memorable characters. Dragonflight and Dragonquest were good. But it seems like <i>these</i> are the books McCaffrey wanted to write. Maybe that&#39;s why Masterharper Robinton is so universally loved, and Harpers so important.<br><br>Yeah, the dragons are what people remember, but Pern&#39;s got music in its soul. These books are magical.<br><br>And I think that&#39;s all the time we have for today. I had to sit two hours of standardized testing and I&#39;m still burnt out. Maybe later I&#39;ll go over more Pern novels, more characters, and more stuff. If I feel like it. Meanwhile, you should all share your opinions and stuff about Pern (at least, those of you who have read it), your opinions on my opinions, questions, thoughts on sci-fi...<br><br>It&#39;s not important how you respond. But it is important that you do.</p>

        <div class="post-body">
            <p>DISCLAIMER: As I write this, I am disorganized and tired. And sick. So this is opinion, and it might not be totally coherent.<br><br>Dragonseye is pretty good. It&#39;s full of fun stuff. Like trials for heinous crimes. And songs. And rocks. And a telekinetic bear, a dentist who harvests brains- wait, no, that&#39;s something else.<br><br>But really, it&#39;s got an engaging plot, likeable good guys, hateable bad guys, a decent pace, only a little creepy romance, cool paintings... y&#39;know. Everything that makes a novel good.<br><br>Unfortunately for you all, a minor plot element overshadows all of that. For you see, Dragonseye is the first Pern novel to devote a meaningful amount of time to portraying a homosexual relationship (Between bluerider P&#39;tero and greenrider M&#39;leng). And I will take any excuse to discuss homosexual relationships in fiction. So here&#39;s a discussion of that thing.<br><br>Now, traditionally, Anne McCaffrey writes romance... badly. Not always awfully, but often badly. Strangely, it seems to be better here. Maybe that&#39;s because this is one of those relationships where she decided not to be creepy (there&#39;s other creepy romance to make up for it in this book). Maybe because the relationship is between two men (and as a side note... for how readily accepting Pern is of gay men being a thing, there sure aren&#39;t any lesbians. What&#39;s with that?) and as a result McCaffrey couldn&#39;t put in creepy gender role stereotypes (not that this has ever stopped <i>other</i> authors...). Maybe it&#39;s because despite my objections to the way she writes romance, she is genuinely competent, I read a lot of badfic, and the standards for homosexual romance, in my book, are just that low.<br><br>Regardless of the reason, it stands to note: Fic authors, numerous professional writers, and other people of that sort just got slaughtered in terms of romance by Anne <i>freaking</i> McCaffrey, in a book released in 1997. Not just romance, <i>gay</i> romance. <br><br>So, let&#39;s look at some common pitfalls in writing romance (some specific to homosexual romance, most... not so much), and maybe a bit about how Dragonseye avoids them, if I feel like it. Well... how Dragonseye avoids them <i>here</i> anyways. But that&#39;s a discussion for another time.<br><br>Make no mistake, this is self-indulgent nonsense. But maybe you&#39;ll derive some enjoyment from it.<br><br><ol>
<br><li>
<b>Representation! Yaaay!</b>: In a lot of professional works, there&#39;s been an urge of late to add representation for minority groups. This includes the LGBTQ people. And you know what? That&#39;s great. Talking more about people who aren&#39;t talked about is good. It can lead to interesting stories, and it can send powerful messages of acceptance. However, for the love of god, <i>never</i> write a character that blatantly exists solely for the purpose of representation. Firstly, you <i>will</i> get complaints from someone (and we&#39;ll get to why in a moment), but secondly... it just results in bland, boring, bad characters. If all we can remember about your character is that they&#39;re &quot;the gay one&quot;, then that isn&#39;t a well conceived character. Nobody&#39;s gonna say, &quot;Hmm... of all the interesting characters in this work, my favorite is the gay one I can&#39;t remember much about!&quot; Speaking of which...</li>
<br><br><li>
<b>Being gay is not a personality trait</b>: So. You&#39;ve got a gay character. Actually, presumably you&#39;ve got two. So how are you going to characterize them? A lot of people think this is more or less complicated than it really is. In order to do it properly, you have to <i>make an actual character</i>. You know, just like you normally do. Consider how them being gay effects their experience (depending on your setting and their personality, the answer might even be &quot;not very much.&quot; If you&#39;re writing in a modern or semi-modern setting, however, it will probably have some impact and may be hanging over them like the Doom of Damocles, depending), sure, but as it turns out, gay people come in all shapes and sizes. All of them. Really.<br><br>Also, this is just my thing, but... personally, please, don&#39;t give your gay character some kind of &quot;stereotypical gay&quot; personality, or at least have a good reason for doing so. This is partly because I feel like it proliferates the idea that gay people are fundamentally alike and that there is a &quot;gay&quot; personality... but mostly because I find all of these stereotypes to be <i>incredibly annoying characters</i>. But hey. If you&#39;ve got<br><br>Dragonseye deals with this part very very well. This might be a consequence of Anne McCaffrey&#39;s... fun... ideas about gender and sexuality (all greenriders are gay or female, no exceptions): On Pern, being gay just isn&#39;t special, so characters can&#39;t use it as a differentiator. And while McCaffrey isn&#39;t the greatest writer in the world, she can at least write reasonably distinct and memorable characters. And while the characters aren&#39;t the focus, and we don&#39;t see a lot of them, they do at least have defined personalities, which counts for a lot.</li>
<br><li>
<b>On Romance</b>: A lot of people seem uncertain about how to write gay romance. I dunno why. It&#39;s a lot like straight romance, seemingly (although maybe don&#39;t ask the man who&#39;s never dated anyone ever...). So... yeah. There are dates. And affection. And people liking one another. Sometimes people argue. Y&#39;know. normal relationship stuff. Except that the people involved are both men. Or women, because this applies to lesbians as well, I assume.<br><br>So here&#39;s the cardinal rule: <b>thou shalt not compromise a character&#39;s personality for romance</b>. Seriously. Even i a character is dating, they are still that character. They should <i>still be IC</i>. No radical personality shifts, woobifying, or so on (unless there&#39;s story/character justification, obviously). They date the way they&#39;d date a person. That means that the dynamic might be a bit different between two guys than between a guy and girl (or maybe not), but not so different as you might think. But speaking of radical personality shifts...</li>
<br><br><li>
<b>Relationship dynamics</b> Oh jeez. I could devote an awful lot of time to this one. <br><br>Okay, so I want you to help me conduct a simple experiment. Draw a pie chart. Fill in the percentage of time a couple spends doing things in bed. Now fill in he percentage of time a couple spends doing things <i>not in bed</i>. As you may notice, the second percentage is vastly higher than the first. Now, when one takes up so much more time than the other, kindly endeavor to justify why the one that takes up <i>less</i> time is the part that defines all aspects of how the couple interacts and relates to one another. Spoiler alert: you can&#39;t, because that&#39;s BS.<br><br>Yes, it&#39;s the old &quot;who wears the pants&quot; nonsense. And it truly is nonsense. What happens in the bedroom does not define a relationship, much less the sum total of everything about a human being. Oddly, the perception that it does seems to have largely vanished when discussing straight people. Because if you start writing it, most people&#39;s kneejerk reaction is &quot;that&#39;s sexist and utterly insane&quot;. Which it is!<br><br>Real relationships are built on a variety of things. Good ones are probably built on trust and mutual respect. I&#39;ve never been in one: who am I to talk? But what I do know is that most of it doesn&#39;t happen in the bedroom.</li>

            <p>Menolly really spoke to me as a kid, moreso than Lessa or Jaxom or any of the dragonriders. She was musical (like me!) didn&#39;t get along with her parents (like me!) and had an injury that made it hard for her to do the things she loved (like... okay, you get the point).

            <p>Yeah, that&#39;s what I mean. Every single character in Harper Hall is <i>vivid</i>, moreso than just about anything else in Pern.<br><br>And part of why the Harper Hall trilogy is so beloved is because I think at least a part of it does speak to everyone. The musicality of it spoke to me, the protagonist spoke to you... yeah.<br><br>That&#39;s probably also why people like <i>The White Dragon</i> so much.

            <p>I don&#39;t have too much to add right now, because I&#39;m coming off a week of having company in which, due to already having taken a week off work this month, I didn&#39;t even get to do any of the fun stuff, and I&#39;m drained. Plus, if I get talking about Pern, I will not stop, so this is probably for the best. ^<em>^<br><br>For those who don&#39;t know, Pern is in my Top 5 Fandoms, and might even come out at #1 in terms of how involved I was, having run a Pern RP on Neopets for a few years.

I am also practiced at explaining and working around (but not excusing) the problematic crap so all the good stuff can still be enjoyed. And there&#39;s a lot of good stuff!

            <p>I&#39;ve been spelunking though AO3. Haven&#39;t really found mission fuel yet... but here are a few notes:<br><br>-There&#39;s a lot of Menolly/Robinton. Not an Offense, but... well. Squick.<br><br>-There is a F&#39;lar/F&#39;nor fic. Called it. Blech.<br><br>-I found <a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/157584?view_adult=true">a fic</a> (Slight NSFW, Dragonquest spoilers) of F&#39;nor apologizing to Brekke for what he did. People who have read Dragonquest, you... probably know what I mean.<br><br>It&#39;s about two paragraphs, but it&#39;s pretty good, as fixfic goes.<br><br>-Sheesh, why is there so much crossover?<br><br>-Ooooh. Thaaaat&#39;s why. It&#39;s so that people can use mating flights as an excuse to get their favorite characters shipped. I am... <i>not happy.</i> Then again, some of them are honest crossovers, so that&#39;s fine.<br><br>-As such, people with knowledge of canon for Voltron, MCU, and various other continua should look at some of these and see if they&#39;re any good. Assuming, of course, that any of those people have an interest.<br><br>-<a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/715575/chapters/1324837">this</a> Harry Potter x-over is pretty bad. Not sure it can really be missioned, but it&#39;s bad.<br><br>-There&#39;s a lot of stuff that slightly breaks canonical dragon role stuff. Like female bronze riders. /shrug. I&#39;m not going to complain.<br><br>-No Sues yet. The closest I&#39;ve found is <a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/662098/chapters/1207976">this fic</a>, which has romance and &quot;canon characters came to earth&quot; and such, but I don&#39;t think our character is a Sue. So... nope.<br><br>-I think I hate <a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/11804217?view_adult=true">this fic</a> (NSFW). It&#39;s... not particularly bad, as fics go? I just hate it. Because greenriders. And violating canon a number of ways to create H/C. And bringing in sexual abuse to create H/C, abuse that feels kind of... unlikely in canon? (because apparently the Weyrleaders are aware and just... do nothing?). And... wow, those are not things you call someone you just met, mating flight or no. And I think that dragon might be borderline speshul.<br><br>I hate canonical violation to force a type of relationship. I especially hate slash I consider badly written. Because I feel that all too often authors writing M/M [EXCESSIVELY LONG RANT WITH SEVERAL DIGRESSIONS ELIDED] and that&#39;s why it&#39;s important that arrays are indexed from 0, not 1.<br><br>...Given, there&#39;s probably an interesting oneshot trapped inside this mess, struggling to get out, but it would be closer to what Nesh posted for the racing prompt then this fic.</p>

            <p>I... don&#39;t hate it? I read it to the end. Let&#39;s see if I can figure out why.<br><br>Here are the problems with it:<br><br>1. Underage green rider. Why. I mean, it&#39;s explained why, and I infer he&#39;s about sixteen at the time of the story, so not exactly a <i>child</i>... but he would&#39;ve been about fourteen when his dragon started rising. That&#39;s pretty hard to get around.<br><br>2. The &quot;green riders always receive during mating flights&quot; thing. Even if McCaffrey believed that, which wouldn&#39;t surprise me, it&#39;s not actually spelled out anywhere that I&#39;m aware of.<br><br>2.5. Even if that were the case, the way that first sex scene is written shows everyone quite sufficiently in command of themselves to do things any way they choose. BS and more BS.<br><br>3. Yeah, all that &quot;baby&quot; and &quot;sweetheart&quot; stuff with someone you just met is yucky.<br><br>4. Kith is definitely a bit too wise and knowing.<br><br>5. The &quot;after-flight congratulations&quot; thing. Is... not a thing. And it weirds me out a lot. Mind your own business, people!<br><br>6. Some minor stuff, like the names all clearly being derived from modern Earth names (even if this is an early Pass, that&#39;s still off) and that the verb &quot;breathe&quot; should have an E on the end.<br><br><br>But there are things I appreciate, too.<br><br>1. The overall message seems to be &quot;don&#39;t be inconsiderate brutes to green riders, they are people, too.&quot; This is good!<br><br>2. The things that are bad are treated as bad. The people responsible are called out on it.<br><br>3. I quite like all the care and consideration S&#39;ven shows to J&#39;son. Correct me if I&#39;m missing something, but it seems to me that that&#39;s well done.<br><br>4. The writing, mechanically, is pretty good overall.<br><br>5. The author seems to have really thought about why things are the way they are, canonically and for the scenario they&#39;re writing, and are carrying out the consequences logically. The abuse isn&#39;t random, nor is it presented as a given: it&#39;s the result of a class of young riders being brought up too quickly in order to fill thinning ranks, without adequate instruction on Weyr ethics due to the deaths of two weyrlingmasters in a row. That, I think, is something that could happen. (See <i>Dragonflight</i>; you fail to properly educate the weyrlings, deliberately or otherwise, and bad things can happen.) This isn&#39;t treated as an excuse, but as a <i>problem</i>, and one that <i>must</i> be addressed even more urgently now that the Pass is over and there&#39;s no more fighting to keep the riders busy.<br><br><br>Let me just say I&#39;m not trying to change anyone&#39;s mind, you don&#39;t have to like it if it rubs you the wrong way, but that&#39;s my take on it.<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3ogrx6d9oohf6D42G44j1A">Terrible Writing Advice</a> is almost exactly what it says: a channel of videos with terrible writing advice, presented in a comedic and snarky way. That advice is a pretty decent primer on what not to do when trying to write an alien ecosystem or cyberpunk story or whatever, especially since there&#39;s often some good advice mixed in that gets dismissed as pointless or too much effort.<br><br>- Tomash</p>

            <p>My roommate showed me <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCC8prZi7q1vnP0A3XX4EWxQ/featured">Clamavi De Profundis</a> a while ago. Their musical style is pretty distinct, but if you&#39;re into that sort of thing it&#39;s absolutely brilliant. They do chants and laments and they do them <i>beautifully</i>, mostly in a lower register. Primarily their stuff comes from <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> but their informational video says they&#39;re inspired by fantasy literature so I&#39;m hoping they&#39;ll branch out to other sources in the future. (They did recently release a cover of the Skyrim theme, which is <i>always</i> a good thing.)</p>

            <p>Which Tomash has already heard me whine about, but anyway . . . it&#39;s the video essays about fiction that get me.  Have some of my regulars!  I should mention that a lot of videos in the lists I&#39;m going to be linking have some casual swearing.  I&#39;ll give more specific warnings if there&#39;s anything more NSFW than that.<br><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/chezapoctube/videos">Lindsay Ellis</a> does probably my favorite video essays.  Her modern work is a lot more in depth, and less gimmicky, than the stuff she used to produce as the Nostalgia Chick.  I especially enjoy her Loose Canon series, which examines how a character changes over time through different adaptations.<br><br>My latest YouTube discovery is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/JennyENicholson/videos">Jenny Nicholson</a>.  Her reviews tend to be really long, but her simple, quiet deadpan delivery and the creative way she examines both good and bad parts of the media she consumes make them worth the listen while washing dishes or such.  As you can see from a lot of her video thumbnails, she&#39;s also a big fan of porgs, and a fan of big porgs.<br><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/thugnotes/videos">Wisecrack</a> is another good source of media analysis.  This is the one channel here that tends to get a bit more NSFW when discussing certain stories, but it still never gets too directly explicit, I don&#39;t think.  The &quot;Earthling Cinema&quot; series attempts to examine movies from a non-Earth culture perspective to deconstruct them, while &quot;Thug Notes&quot; summarizes literature and discusses its themes without getting tied down by formal language.  Their other, non-themed videos on philosophy in fiction tend to be excellent, as well.<br><br>The videos on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCf29Sq6-XxLQG_XuJwMHaFg/videos">Nando vs. Movies</a> look at a facet of a film or TV show that fell flat, formulates a solution, and walks that change through to see all the effects it would have had on the final story.  It&#39;s mostly superhero movies, but there&#39;re a couple of <i>Star Wars</i> videos as well.<br><br>The content on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/Nerdwriter1/videos">Nerdwriter1</a> is literally all over the place‚Äîfiction, art, music, comedy, business politics.  I only watch the videos that look interesting to me, so I haven&#39;t seen them all.  But take a look; I&#39;m sure there&#39;s at least something to capture your attention here.<br><br>‚Äîdoctorlit, addict for sure</p>

            <p>My favorite English professor in college occasionally showed us a Thug Notes video in class so we could get the cliffnotes on a piece we weren&#39;t actually reading but helped to understand whatever we were discussing. I think we watched the one on Oedipus at some point, as well as a few others. It&#39;s a really good way to get the basics of the story along with a few themes without actually having to read it. I&#39;d especially recommend that to literature students.</p>

Stop reading this and watch his channel.<br><br>And then comes <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBs2Y3i14e1NWQxOGliatmg">Mother&#39;s Basement</a>, where the big deal are openings and how they&#39;re constructed, but also animes, who can also be made fun of through nice &#39;publicity videos&#39; around one popular trope of the genre. Also, strong opinions against Sword Art Online. Another time sink you need in your life.<br><br></p>

            <p>To you, my fellow Boarders, I propose a candidate for the Legendary badfic list: &quot;Starkit&#39;s Prophecy.&quot; This fic is known as the My Immortal badfic of the Warriors fandom. First the criteria:<br><br>&quot;The fic must be at least five years old.&quot; Research from Snowy and leafeyes confirmed they&#39;ve heard about this fic as far back as 2010.<br><br>&quot;Return a decent number of relevant Google hits from the past year, indicating that people are still talking about it.&quot; I did some research and found search results about this fic from the past year, and the first two pages were full. I didn&#39;t look further than that.<br><br>&quot;Be famous in its own right, not because of the author/sequel/prequel/fanart/whatever.&quot; Yes, so much yes. Snowy knows of it, and he&#39;s not a Warriors fan, for example. Staying away from this fic was one of the first things I learned when entering the fanfiction of Warriors.<br><br>&quot;Be acknowledged as awful by a majority of PPCers with an opinion.&quot; When I read this fic in Discord voice chat, everyone agreed it was nothing less than a trollfic. But this criteria, I believe, can be only fulfilled by the acknowledgement of the Board.<br><br>(A repost link since the original was taken down: <a href="http://starkitsprophecy.webstarts.com/the_story.html"><a href="http://starkitsprophecy.webstarts.com/the_story.html">http://starkitsprophecy.webstarts.com/the_story.html</a></a>)<br><br>Some charges: the grammar and spelling is atrocious; there is a horde of mini-Sues; there is a prophecy, and the warrior spirits know that it&#39;s about the Sue right away; the Sue has a name that is forbidden by canon; she &#39;s an impossibly good fighter at a young age, a canon character returns from the dead, has uncanonical powers, and is also evil for no reason.<br><br>(I am planning to mission this fic regardless of what is decided, and I will stop at the end of chapter four [or this fic&#39;s second chapter three.])<br></p>

            <p>I like seeing this much calmer version of Velociripper, compared to his original appearances: specifically that while he&#39;s no longer being aggressively tough and macho, he&#39;s still got elements of predatory dinosaur to him.<br><br>I do feel like Citrine accepts her status as a bootleg of a separate canon weirdly quickly, especially when she calls her weapon a copy and refers to the Hinata replacement, a person she has known a long time as &quot;Gem!Hinata.&quot;  On the other hand, I get that this is an intro piece, and the point wasn&#39;t to go through the entire long process of a character coming to terms with their created nature, so . . . yeah.<br><br>‚Äîdoctorlit, catching up</p>

            <p>One little character development thing I&#39;ve always wanted Ripper to go through is to basically discard his original ambitions to subjugate humanity and his lack of restraint regarding his violent tendencies, since I disliked them in hindsight and found that they made his personality rather flat. His updated temperament is more realistic and interesting to me because carnivorous creatures as a general rule aren&#39;t actually aggressive unless defending kills, territory, or relations such as offspring if they have a social structure, and even then they&#39;d rather not risk getting hurt and being unable to hunt. Herbivores don&#39;t have the same restraint and their main priority is staying alive, whatever messed with them be darned, which is why many large herbivores like hippos or even cattle and horses cause more human fatalities annually than carnivores do. It&#39;s also worth noting was that Ripper&#39;s original characterization was basically &quot;KILL FRIGGIN&#39; EVERYTHING&quot; and more akin to the Chaotic Evil raptors from the earlier JP installments and the original two novels, which was justified by their lack of social structure and rectified to some extent by Jurassic World&#39;s Raptor Squad. I imagine that since Rips follows his home continuum quite closely he&#39;d come to terms with this change in depiction and adjust his nature accordingly.<br><br>It wasn&#39;t my intention to go into too much depth regarding Palmeira&#39;s adjustment to becoming a character of her own, but the in-universe justification of her accepting that she isn&#39;t Canon!Nami after all is that she started doubting that she and said canon were the same as soon as the agents who found her and her crew pressed the charges against them. I guess the other two stubbornly choosing to fight back and getting shattered as a result probably didn&#39;t help her case, either.</p>

            <p>There were a few instances of &quot;the PPC HQ&quot; that tripped my &quot;this sounds off&quot; sense, but maybe that&#39;s just me.<br><br>Second, how are people pronouncing the exclamation points?<br><br>Third, how&#39;d Palmaira know that she might only have Nami&#39;s memories?<br><br>Overall, this was reasonably well written and a pretty good introduction interlude.

            <p>I might have to go back again and check what usages of &quot;PPC HQ&quot; could be replaced with &quot;PPC Headquarters&quot; or &quot;Headquarters&quot; for better flow. I may need to check on whether the HQ abbreviation is used in other works but I don&#39;t see why it couldn&#39;t be.<br><br>The pronunciation I&#39;ve seen on the Wiki is &quot;[descriptor]-bang-[character]&quot;. I suppose we could roll with the punctuation mark being silent, i.e. Gem!Nami being pronounced as &quot;Gem-Nami&quot;.<br><br>And the badfic the character who&#39;d become Palmeira comes from made it clear that it was canon!Nami who was kidnapped, tortured, and polymorphed into her gem self from the fic. So that means aside from that grossness, she&#39;s largely canon-compliant and doesn&#39;t belong specifically because she&#39;s a being in the style of one continuum &quot;converted&quot; from a canon native to a different one to the point where she&#39;s no longer able to fit in either.<br><br>The mission Palmeira and Ripper are going to go into is definitely gonna rectify the relative humor drought, assuming we can actually get around to writing it! Although that&#39;s a matter that eatpraylove and I will decide together once we get around to actually writing the good stuff.</p>

            <p>Thanks to hpoggie for beta-ing these. Part 1 is the bios for my agents:<br><br>Name: Colonel Caleb Bradbury<br><br>Species: Human<br><br>Age: 56<br><br>Sex: Male<br><br>Home Continuum: World 1.567 repeating, a minor alternate universe<br><br>Personality: Bradbury is what is known as a ‚Äúcharacter‚Äù. He has a strange ability to procure just about anything just about anywhere, and a related ability to establish himself as an authority figure even in situations totally unfamiliar to him.<br><br>Appearance: The colonel is a gaunt man, just shy of two meters tall. His head is very round, a feature accentuated by his rather severe buzz-cut. He has a short beard, skin on the brown side, and a generally weathered look. He is a good bit more athletic than one would expect of a man his age, thanks to the medical and cybernetic science of the 2050s.<br><br>History: In his many years he has been not just an officer in the Argentine army, but also a grave digger, stamp forger, purveyor of shoddy knockoff products, piano tuner, ticket scalper, blackjack dealer, and many other things.<br><br><br><br>Name: Rasputin Gibbs<br><br>Species: Draconian<br><br>Age: 24<br><br>Sex: Male<br><br>Home Continuum: World 1.963, the world that exists in certain conspiracy theories.<br><br>Personality: On some deep level, Gibbs wants to be in a Sergio Leone movie. He doesn‚Äôt speak much, he wears a stetson, and he seems terminally calm. His interest in cookery according to the Galenic theory is just a bonus. He uses Draconian expressions in his speech, such as the greeting ‚ÄúBast Chauble‚Äù and the philosophical concept of going ‚Äúeven more unto Yark.‚Äù<br><br>Appearance: Gibbs is a seven foot tall reptilian humanoid with a hunched posture, dark green scales, and a nice set of fangs. He is rarely seen without his stetson, and his eyes hold a look of steely determination that took him years to perfect.<br><br>History: Gibbs spent many years working as a security guard in Dulce base, a joint human-draconian military base located under Archuelta Mesa. He held himself to a very high standard, and soon became known as one of the most capable officers on the security team. With this good mixture of skill and expendability, Gibbs was an ideal candidate to send on a test jaunt through the base‚Äôs new portal. He came unstuck in space and time, and learned of Sues, or as he called them reality-warping entities. When we meet him, he has several unlicensed Sue killings under his belt, and has consequently attracted the attention of the PPC.</p>

            <p>Alright. Settle in--being me, I write a lot to begin with, and I&#39;ve also responded to HG&#39;s comments, so...that might have lengthened it. As usual, I&#39;ve used formatting to try to make it easy to follow. If anything came out unclear, just ask.<br><br><br><b>Your characters:</b><br><br><u><i>Col. Bradbury:</i></u> Nice to see an older human! For obvious reasons, a lot of agents tend to be young or young-looking when they start out, so, well, nice to see. I also just plain like the description of the colonel. Provided you avoid the potential pitfall of his ability to &quot;procure just about anything just about anywhere&quot; serving as deus ex machina, I can see him being pretty fun to read about. Actually, he&#39;s starting to feel a tiny bit Discworld-ish to me? In a great way. Unless someone can point out any problems (other than what HG said, which I&#39;ll address in a moment), I think he&#39;ll do just fine.<br><br><i>Regarding HG&#39;s comments:</i> Yeah, I think his world would generally be labeled as just &#39;unpublished&#39; or &#39;alternate World One&#39; or something? I&#39;m not completely sure. I know I have an agent planned from an alternate World One, also set in the future, which started from &#39;what if Yiddish was still a widely spoken language?&#39; and developed from there. I never called it anything other than &#39;an alternate World One&#39;, though, to my memory.<br><br>My main question here is: what exactly makes Bradbury&#39;s home universe an alternate one? The only thing I&#39;m seeing is that he&#39;s from the 2050s and they have medical and cybernetic science. If your main reasoning here is just that you want to be able to play with your own idea of a possible projection of the future (perfectly fine, sounds interesting)--it could really probably just be labeled &#39;alternate World One timeline&#39; or something along those lines? I&#39;d be happy for more details regarding Bradbury&#39;s home, though, to understand what makes it an AU. Apart from that, I bow to HG&#39;s knowledge here.<br><br><u><i>Gibbs:</i></u> I...kind of like Gibbs as well. I think there&#39;s also a meme of something that looks a bit like him, so I have that automatic mental image, and it amuses me a bit. I&#39;m personally unfamiliar with the conspiracy theories you seem to be referencing in his profile, but...sure, yeah. I&#39;m amused. It should also be interesting to see how a human colonel and a draconian security guard from different universes interact. From the profile, Gibbs just...well, he also comes across as a bit of a character! The young, kind of a maverick sort. That could also make him a good foil for Bradbury. All in all, sounds good.<br><br><i>Regarding HG&#39;s comments:</i> Yeah, typos need to be fixed. Also, if you haven&#39;t already, I suggest laying out at least the main conspiracy theories that are true or not true there. For one thing, Gibbs will probably have to explain it at some point (or be smacked in the face with &#39;what? Nah, that&#39;s just a conspiracy theory!&#39;); for another, it&#39;ll help both you and us to get a sense of what&#39;s going on.<br><br>(Also, if Dulce base is still in there--I&#39;m unclear on whether there&#39;s a problem with that or if it&#39;s just the misspelling on the Mesa--it should be &#39;Dulce Base&#39;, as it is in your response. Quick Google search confirms that capitalization. So that&#39;s another thing to fix.)<br><br><b>Characters overall:</b> some details need fixing or tweaking, but...overall, both agents look good! Be a little careful of how you use Bradbury&#39;s talents.<br><br>Whew. On to the <b>first prompt!</b><br><br>Alright. First things first: I really advise spacing for readability. I can get through this prompt and the other because they&#39;re short, but my days of making my way through longer stories like this if the writing&#39;s okayish and I like the plot are pretty much behind me. I&#39;d advise hitting &#39;enter&#39; an extra time at every new paragraph, or else take advantage of wider spacing and the tab key to indent the new paragraphs. (I don&#39;t know how you&#39;re planning on posting stories platform-wise, but one or the other of these methods should work on pretty much anything.)<br><br>With that out of the way: Um, I&#39;m afraid you have another place name mistake. Matama, New Zealand is neither a real place (from what I can find) nor where FotR was filmed; <i>Matamata</i>, New Zealand, on the other hand, was indeed the town nearest the location of the Hobbiton set. That needs fixing. Between this and the Mesa (and the base capitalization)...you might want to start using Google to check your facts a little more, assuming that&#39;s an option for you. Or asking a beta to do it if it isn&#39;t. It&#39;s a good tool, and very easy to use for things like this.<br><br>Also, while Bradbury was a child at the right time to grow up with Lord of the Rings, he seems to have gained the trivia of the exact location of the set without the trivia that it was exterior only? Then again, I suppose he could reasonably assume that someone decided to build interiors in the past fifty-ish years...though I do have to wonder why he&#39;s thinking of the Hobbits as &quot;well-dressed&quot; when, unless fashions have seriously changed in his time, he should probably be thinking they&#39;re dressed in a really old style? That is, <i>really</i> old? It just...doesn&#39;t quite connect the more I think about it. I expect it&#39;s meant to be in contrast to what he expects to be normal pygmy dress, but...it still seems odd that his version of &#39;well-dressed&#39; is Hobbiton and not something a bit more...modern.<br><br>As to the Hydramatic drive...okay. That does seem to be the capitalization. Fun fact--Hydra-Matic/Hydramatic Drive is also the name for what was apparently the first really successful automatic car transmission! The things you learn. The Pinkwater version does indeed look like something the PPC might want, though.<br><br>One more small thing before I actually get into the writing: I assume Nirvana&#39;s dressed like a Hobbit, since Bradbury addresses him as a local? (His Ye Olde Englishe is incorrect to my knowledge, by the way, though that may be on purpose? I love the wordplay in his second line, though--&quot;faculties&quot; and &quot;faculty&quot;. Very fun.) And another thing, actually: Nirvana can speak parentheses? And Bradbury can hear them?<br><br>I&#39;d add a bit of description somewhere at the end, probably, so that it doesn&#39;t go completely into dialogue for the last few exchanges of Bradbury&#39;s section and we continue to get a sense of movement. It would also give us a little more sense of, well, everything, including what Nirvana&#39;s thinking (I don&#39;t necessarily mean you should write out his thoughts, but even a moment of speculative looking or hesitation or something would make it flow a bit more). Things like that. Apart from this, it seems mostly fine and readable, and I like some of the dialogue. My only other problem is...actually, this is something HG pointed out as well. Is Bradbury from a Daniel Pinkwater bookverse? If he is, then <i>that</i> is his home continuum. If it&#39;s not, then well...okay, honestly, either way I&#39;m a bit confused about what Bradbury&#39;s job is when we meet him. The terms are confusing (and don&#39;t seem to fit with him being a soldier); he&#39;s pretty formal in speech, which is...interesting, if also a bit confusing? Especially since it doesn&#39;t match his speech patterns in the second prompt <i>at all</i>? I just...I&#39;m confused. This closer read-through is confusing me. Which is a real shame, because I still do like the character ideas and some of the writing (especially the opening of the second prompt).<br><br>Okay. Gibbs&#39; part...well. I&#39;ve read the explanation of the change in style; fine. It&#39;s a nice idea, but it is rather jarring here. This is also all one paragraph (except for Gibbs&#39; two-word reaction at the end), which is...neither good nor necessary. It does feel a little like how Gibbs might write up a report, honestly, which I kind of like, but...that doesn&#39;t really make it work here, especially since it comes right after a different style. If this was its own piece and spaced out it would work better, though it&#39;s still...well, I wouldn&#39;t advise you to write a mission like this, though I would definitely read a mission where small chunks of it were actually excerpts from Gibbs&#39; written mission report--that sounds like it could be done amusingly.<br><br>(Also: you want &quot;Gibbs went to compliment the kid&quot; rather than &quot;complement.&quot;)<br><br>(Also also: I do like Gibbs as we see him here! He seems to mesh with his profile, which is nice, and he just plain seems like he&#39;d be fun to read about.)<br><br><b>First prompt overall:</b> This is...a bit messier than I remember thinking on the first, sleepy read-through. On the plus side, the SPaG looks fine and I&#39;m not noticing any actually incorrect sentences. It could really use reworking, though. I&#39;d like to see this succeed, but...I&#39;m afraid the current version isn&#39;t there yet.<br><br><b>The second prompt:</b><br><br>Okay. As mentioned before, both in this post and in my first response, I really love this opening. So much. The entire first paragraph is just...I love it. Response Center 9-unreadable-smudge is fantastic, the military metaphor is both appropriate and executed nicely...There should probably be a new paragraph started at &quot;On the edge of this cave of non-wonders,&quot; and again right before Bradbury speaks, but...listen, I love it. I really do. It&#39;s nicely done, it stands out, and it still makes me either smile or just sit up and go &#39;I like this!&#39; on the third or fourth reading. I really like it.<br><br>The rest is, uh...okay, let&#39;s break it down.<br><br>-As mentioned in my response to the first prompt, Bradbury&#39;s speech patterns don&#39;t match <i>at all</i> between the two prompts. In the first, he says things like &quot;I accept this,&quot; and, well, <i>‚ÄúI assure you, [...] I am in full possession of all my faculties, except the faculty of the department of engineering, who could probably help me. But I digress. Perhaps you, in the absence of the faculty, could furnish aid?‚Äù</i> In the second, well, his first longer line is this: <i>‚ÄúAre we just gonna keep talking in circles like a couple of parrots, or are we gonna do something?‚Äù</i> He does keep some of his nicer words, but...there&#39;s definitely a disconnect, and there just isn&#39;t enough writing (or anything in his profile) to know if he switches formality levels depending on the situation or if this is, in fact, a continuity error.<br><br>-After that beautiful opening, the entire prompt essentially becomes dialogue. There are six words mentioning who&#39;s talking (three for each), and one seven-word sentence for Gibbs leaving and the passage of time. That&#39;s <i>it</i>. Now, dialogue-only stories are a thing, but...the combination here is just...it&#39;s odd.<br><br>-Speaking of the dialogue, it would be really well supported by more description. I don&#39;t even mean description as nice as the opening bit: I just mean description of any sort. A bit of a sense of movement, maybe some other stuff that&#39;s in the RC, the expressions on their faces, their body language, thoughts, smiles, frowns, getting up--I&#39;ll take anything. It could be easily combined with giving a little more indication of who&#39;s talking, too--it gets hard to follow, especially since a, don&#39;t know them too well yet, and b, while they do sound different from each other, it isn&#39;t such a stark difference that it&#39;s immediately obvious (as in, say, a Victorian and a modern slang-using teenager in a conversation).<br><br>-Because it&#39;s almost completely dialogue, some of the jokes fall flat. Actually, I think most of them do. There&#39;s no timing, because we have no real clue what they&#39;re doing; their expressions can&#39;t add anything because they aren&#39;t described...<br><br>-We get some sense of how they interact just from the dialogue, it&#39;s true, but...so, so, so much more could be shown with a little description. I don&#39;t know if they trust each other or just tolerate each other; I don&#39;t know if they&#39;re wary, or curious, or...I just don&#39;t have <i>enough</i>, and I&#39;d really like more. I like these characters! I want to really see them interact!<br><br>-I like the final joke, with the bottle of whiskey. Unfortunately, again, it falls flat. If we had a pause right before the line, a description, anything--look, here, I&#39;ll show you what I mean:<br><br><i>‚ÄúI‚Äôm back!‚Äù<br><br>Bradbury looked up. He&#39;d moved a good deal of the debris around, but had, to all appearances, failed to actually find the console. ‚ÄúAny luck?‚Äù<br><br>Gibbs nodded. ‚ÄúYeah, they had a very good deal on baking stuff.&quot; He set something down on the wobbly table with a </i>thunk<i>, and smirked. &quot;Also, I got a bottle of whiskey, ‚Äòcause this seems like it‚Äôs gonna take a while.‚Äù</i><br><br>It&#39;s obviously my writing style, and my interpretation of both how I&#39;d frame that joke and how I&#39;m very quickly interpreting possible ways for your characters to interact...but do you see a difference? The reader (hopefully) gets a better sense of what&#39;s going on, of what Gibbs is like, of time passing, and a bit of both the RC interior and how the two agents might interact. It&#39;s a lot more information, added with four descriptive or mildly descriptive sentences.<br><br><b>Second prompt overall:</b> SPaG and sentences are perfectly fine yet again. The opening is beautiful. Would heavily advise adding a <i>lot</i> more description to the dialogue to fill out the scene, make the jokes shine, and give a much better sense of the RC, the characters, and the new partnership. Also: Bradbury unfortunately seems a bit less strongly developed than Gibbs in writing, possibly because of the inconsistent speech patterns--it feels like you have less of a grasp on how to write him right now. It would be good to either work with him a little more or just resolve the continuity issues, depending on whether this impression is correct or it&#39;s accidental.<br><br><b>The badfic:</b> It&#39;s...wellll. Definitely pretty OOC (in a way that reminds me vaguely of Partially Kissed Hero at the bits with Sirius, though far milder and, well, a lot of things remind me of PKH these days). Skimming along, Harry is apparently...well, he just called Arwen his aunt, and Aragorn thought he was James for a minute? And earlier he said he talked to Hades? Yeah, uh, I think you could get a good mission out of this. There&#39;s definitely plenty to comment on.<br><br>Alright. With all that said...I&#39;m afraid that, for now, it&#39;s <b>Permission Denied</b>. Fix the small errors in both the writing pieces and the profiles; spend a little time with Bradbury (or with making him come across consistently, depending); rework both your pieces (and run them by betas--it&#39;s good to see you had a beta this first time, by the way, forgot to mention); and submit them again. You truly have some great ideas here, and are obviously capable of writing that shines**; if you can expand and polish what&#39;s here, I think it has the potential to be amazing.<br><br>~Z<br><br>**See the second prompt&#39;s opening and, to a slightly lesser extent, Bradbury&#39;s first non-Ye Olde Englishe line.</p>

            <p>(I‚Äôm new in this job and don‚Äôt know what to do.)<br><br>Like Zingenmir, I see a lot of potential and mostly like what I read. But I have an issue with Colonel Bradbury‚Äôs origin.<br><br>World One is just like Real Life, except that the PPC exists as a transdimensional organization. Worlds numbered 2 or higher are word worlds defined by their respective canon. World One and a Half (or 1.5) is just like World One except that <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Eusabius">Eusabius</a> and <a href="http://ppc.wikia.com/wiki/Florestan">Florestan</a> somehow survived Robert Schumann‚Äôs death and became actual persons. <br><br>World 1.963 is just like World One except that some/many/most conspiracy theories are true (some must still be untrue, because otherwise certain aspects of this world would contradict each other). Minor issue: That‚Äôs probably what you mean, and I would buy it if I could find <i>Archu<b>el</b>ta Mesa</i> on a map. Actually, the difference appears to be that in World 1.963, Archuelta Mesa and Dulce base exist, while the conspiracy theory about an alien base under Archu<b>le</b>ta Mesa is still untrue. If this isn‚Äôt intentional, a typo in such a crucial point of your Draconian agent‚Äôs back story doesn‚Äôt bode well.<br><br>But in which way would World 1.567 repeating be different from World One? We can‚Äôt tell, because Bradbury, using the medical and cybernetic science of the 2050s, apparently comes from the future and we don‚Äôt know the future of World One. Thus, tacking an irrational number on his world of origin doesn‚Äôt work for me; he must be from some speculative work, even if it is unpublished original fiction.<br> <br>Also, I don‚Äôt quite understand why Allen I. Nirvana immediately wants to recruit Colonel Bradbury. He says that he <i> was working on something unrelated</i>, so he is apparently aware that Bradbury is not a character of the fic Nirwana is investigating. Shouldn‚Äôt Nirwana ask some questions similar to what Bradbury asks him? Who are you? Where do you come from? What are you doing here? How did you get here? There is no implication that Nirwana watched Bradbury for some time and already found out some of the answers without asking. At least he figures that Bradbury can‚Äôt just leave and go home on his own, but did Bradbury show any signs of actually fitting into the PPC or not actually wanting to go home, or is the PPC so desperate for new recruits?  <br><br>I like that Rasputin Gibbs is just <i> sentenced to conscription into the PPC</i> for <i>making a nuisance and vigilante Sue killing</i>. He obviously was under observation for some time, probably by several assassins who reported that he killed their Sue‚Äôs before they could get to them. What I don‚Äôt like so much is that it is a single paragraph tacked onto a different story. &quot;We see both agents recruited&quot; works better if both agents are recruited at the same time in the same place rather than in two unrelated chapters of a story that‚Äôs too short to have chapters. Perhaps you should have gone with the other option ‚Äì &quot;One agent tells the other how they were recruited&quot; ‚Äì where Gibbs could still chip in with some lines about his recruitment.  But telling a story in dialogue may just not be your thing and I don‚Äôt nudge you to do that. Actually, my complaint here is more that it sets a bad example than that we don‚Äôt see enough of your second agent.<br><br>HG</p>

            <p>&quot;Hydramatic drive&quot; and &quot;Space-Time-and-The-Other&quot; aren‚Äôt words you just made up? This totally changes the way I read Bradbury‚Äôs recruitment. If I need more background information, I shouldn‚Äôt expect to find it in your writing; I should just go and read that novel. So this makes Nirwana not asking any questions much more acceptable. On the other hand, there‚Äôs the offense of not properly disclaiming the origin of your ideas. Colonel Caleb Bradbury now appears to be a background character (never actually mentioned in the novel, because we‚Äôre not allowed to abduct canon characters) from Daniel Pinkwater&#39;s <i>Borgle</i>, so that should be named as his home continuum on the character sheet.<br><br>Since it got a name, there‚Äôs no need to attach a number to Colonel Bradbury‚Äôs home continuum, and it should be a natural number anyway; it‚Äôs meant to represent the order in which the Flowers discovered those worlds, but we don‚Äôt really want to establish this order beyond that World One was obviously the first. In-universe, nobody bothers to memorize and use the numbers when there are more telling words to be used. I can imagine the bureaucrat who must keep track of the numbers attaching n.something to alternate universes (like movieverse versus bookverse) for specific values of n, but since we still won‚Äôt know the value of n for a specific bookverse (or whatever would be the original canon), this is mostly irrelevant. An exception are numbers greater than one and less than two for variations of World One created by writing in the PPC multiverse. We may actually want to start keeping track of those. The only ones I‚Äôm currently aware of are World One and a Half and the potential World 1.963. <br><br><i>Nirvana was mostly trying to get at the Hydramatic drive</i>. Well, he took note of Bradbury‚Äôs <i> high-value asset</i>, but I totally didn‚Äôt get that. <br><br>I didn‚Äôt say anything about the second prompt yet. (I secretly hoped that Zingenmir would return when she‚Äôs less sleepy.) I actually liked it better then the first, because it didn‚Äôt confuse me. There may be too much dialogue and too few actual events (talking head syndrome), but that may be intentional to display yet another style besides the two recruitments, and showing this flexibility may actually be a good thing. If I could fit that glaurunging hat onto my head, I would probably let you get away with this different styles thing, but I would still like to see another PG‚Äôs opinion. Alas, I couldn‚Äôt let you pass anyway, for the lack of understanding or consideration displayed with World 1.567 repeating. <br><br>Also, I noticed three cases of a word probably missing (although, not being a native speaker, I‚Äôm not entirely certain whether the suggested word is actually required in all cases:<br><i>Bradbury thought briefly, unsure how to speak</i> <b>to</b> <i>the locals...</i><br><i> The creature pulled a notebook from one of his pockets, and began</i> <b>to</b> write.<br><i>Then a teenager walked up to the thing that should not exist, and began to talk to it, getting in</i> <b>the</b> <i>way of his shot.</i><br>Keep an eye on that kind of mistake.<br><br>Suggestion: Rewrite or at least polish this up, then submit again.<br><br>HG</p>

            <p>This was pretty fun to read. You had me laughing a bit, multiple times, and I noticed very few errors--the only thing I really noticed was a time or two where there should possibly have been a new paragraph, which is pretty minor. There *might* also be a run-on sentence somewhere, but I&#39;m not sure--I&#39;m sleepy, and mainly just saw a bunch of commas without actually reading the sentence back a time or two to check that they work. Odds are it&#39;s fine. I do love your descriptions, and the vocabulary you use--while your style is obviously different than Scapegrace&#39;s, based on the first prompt I&#39;d say you seem to have a similar quality to make me want to read more.<br><br>I do think your first prompt is better than your second. Especially the second half of the second. It felt a bit choppier, and possibly could have used a little more description or length (or both) to make it flow. I do see what you wanted it to be, with the whiskey as a punchline, but I&#39;m not entirely sure it works to best effect. On the other hand, I *am* sleepy. Alert!me, or a different PG, can discuss that better (or raise eyebrows at sleepy!me and tell her to go back to sleep for a bit longer). Your first prompt, though, had a lot of good things in it at first read, though bits of it were a tiny bit choppy? I think? It was a fun read, though, like I said.<br><br>Didn&#39;t open the fic link, but I do rather like the idea of getting VR training missions from that site, if you don&#39;t want to make something up! It sounds like an interesting idea. I don&#39;t know how many VR training missions people have written (I think doctorlit wrote something along those lines for a prompt once?) but it could be interesting as part of an interlude, or something.<br><br>My Hat is partly off, however, because I don&#39;t feel awake enough to judge compatibility of some of this with the PPC universe. I say this not to alarm you, but mostly to get the attention of someone (again, whether a more alert future me or a different PG) who will be able to more clearly remember past agents and so on. I *think* the characters&#39; skills are probably fine, though it&#39;s possible the finer details of recruitment should be tweaked a tiny bit, but I&#39;d like a second, much more alert opinion.<br><br>So, conclusions: overall, this looks pretty good and was fun to read. While I think there is probably writing advice to be dispensed, it currently seems like it&#39;ll be fairly minor; apart from that the writing is rich in detail and vocabulary, has no really glaring SPaG problems, and is frequently amusing. A second look to give that writing advice, and comment more thoroughly on the second prompt, would be good. The second look should also double-check compatibility of some elements (small things, mind you--again, please don&#39;t panic) with the PPC universe. However, my sleepy verdict is that this looks promising, and probably needs very few changes, if any.<br><br>~Z, who should really go get less sleepy now. Preferably with food.</p>

            <p>Here&#39;s my control prompt. I chose &quot;we see both agents recruited.&quot; Once again thanks to hpoggie for being my beta.<br><br><br>Two Days<br><br>   Colonel Caleb Bradbury, veteran of twenty years and uncounted battles, was having a very confusing day. He must have taken a wrong turn on the interstate, because now he was in some sort of idyllic countryside, and his preliminary scouting efforts had revealed a village home to what appeared to be well-dressed pygmies. Given that some of the houses appeared to be mostly underground, he did not discount the idea that he had landed in Matama, New Zealand, while the Fellowship Of the Ring was being filmed. Space-Time-and-The-Other tourism had taken him to stranger places, though the credibility of this as the destination of this particular detour was somewhat harmed by extreme realism of the area and the apparent lack of a camera crew.<br>  But, of course, Bradbury had not risen through the ranks of the Argentine army by losing his head in unfamiliar situations. So, while he was confused, he didn‚Äôt show it. Instead, he occupied himself with concealing his vehicle. A television detector van, let alone one fitted with a Hydramatic drive, would cause some awkward questions in what could be a medieval society. This proved futile, as he had only the entrenching tool he had brought with him, and he was trying to hide a van. Instead, he unpacked his gear and made camp for the night. This consisted of hiding inside his overturned van and eating a protein bar. As both a soldier and a time tourist, he had gained the ability to sleep just about anywhere, so he quickly drifted off.<br>   The next morning the Colonel awoke to a someone knocking on the door above him. He looked up to see one of the locals, and he unlocked the door. The humanoid quickly opened the door and climbed from the door frame into the van, using the seats as handholds. Bradbury thought briefly, unsure how to speak the locals, then said: ‚ÄúHail and hello, kind sirrah. I bideth thee good tidings. Prithee, what bringest thou to mine cave of steel?‚Äù The creature pulled a notebook from one of his pockets, and began write. Bradbury could hear him mutter:<br>‚ÄúEncountered extra-canonical humanoid‚Ä¶ Seems to have caught sunstroke‚Ä¶ In possession of high-value asset (currently damaged).‚Äù<br>‚ÄúI assure you,‚Äù said Colonel Bradbury, ‚ÄúI am in full possession of all my faculties, except the faculty of the department of engineering, who could probably help me. But I digress. Perhaps you, in the absence of the faculty, could furnish aid?‚Äù<br>The man put away his notebook and looked at Bradbury as if he had just noticed him.<br>‚ÄúYes‚Ä¶ I think we can come to some sort of deal. How about I take this wreck off your hands and get you out of here?‚Äù<br>‚ÄúI accept this, but before we go, I have some questions. First: Where am I? Second: Why are you here? Third: How do we leave? And finally: Who are you?‚Äù<br>‚ÄúHobbiton; I was working on something unrelated; through a portal; and Allen I. Nirvana, department of Intelligence, PPC.‚Äù<br>‚ÄúExcellent, let‚Äôs get out of here.‚Äù<br>‚ÄúTell me, are you interested in a job?‚Äù<br><br>  Rasputin Gibbs lay in wait. Flashgun at the ready, he scanned the horizon for the shape of his target. Ever since the accident, this had been his life: the glitter-monsters were an affront to reality, so he killed them. It was simple, so it brought him comfort, and a creature in his situation needed a routine. As the thing came into view, he readied his weapon and prepared to make the kill. Then a teenager walked up to the thing that should not exist, and began to talk to it, getting in way of his shot. Gibbs held back. He didn‚Äôt kill people. As he waited, the kid finished talking, the monster said something, and then the kid killed it with a knife. Gibbs went to complement him on his work, but as Gibbs approached, the kid turned and spoke to him: ‚ÄúRasputin Gibbs, you have been charged with making a nuisance and vigilante Sue killing. You are sentenced to conscription into the PPC. Look this way please.‚Äù<br>‚ÄúWait, wh-‚Äù</p>

            <p>Here&#39;s my randomly selected creative prompt. I rolled &quot;One agent tries to convince another to help with some kind of business venture.&quot;<br><br>Scrounge<br><br> As bases of operations went, Response Center 9-unreadable-smudge wasn‚Äôt among the best. To be fair, it had floor space, but most of it was occupied. This occupying force was led by a vanguard of random trash with specialist support provided by the remains of shelves, and an armored division of broken machinery interspersed the ranks, as if to cow would-be cleaners into submission. On the edge of this cave of non-wonders was a small circle where the debris had been cleared, occupied by a human and a lizard-man. After a long silence, the human spoke:<br>‚ÄúSo.‚Äù<br>‚ÄúSo?‚Äù Replied the lizard-man.<br>‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù<br>‚ÄúYeah?‚Äù<br>‚ÄúAre we just gonna keep talking in circles like a couple of parrots, or are we gonna do something?‚Äù<br>‚ÄúWhat do you have in mind?‚Äù<br>‚ÄúAlcohol. It‚Äôs the best bartering commodity we can feasibly get, and our key into this place‚Äôs informal power structure.‚Äù<br>‚ÄúHmm‚Ä¶ Have you done this before, or are we going to poison our coworkers?‚Äù<br>‚ÄúI learned how to do this years ago. We just need water, sugar, and yeast. I once did this with bread mold and ketchup.‚Äù<br>‚ÄúThat must be sheer murder on the humors.‚Äù<br>‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry, I‚Äôm never doing that again.‚Äù<br>‚ÄúSo how do we do this?‚Äù<br>‚ÄúI think there‚Äôs a general store back there, you can probably get stuff there,‚Äù said the human. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll try to find this alleged ‚Äòconsole‚Äô thing.‚Äù<br>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs your funeral.‚Äù<br>The lizard-man left, and several hours passed.<br>‚ÄúI‚Äôm back!‚Äù<br>‚ÄúAny luck?‚Äù<br>‚ÄúYeah, they had a very good deal on baking stuff. Also, I got a bottle of whiskey, ‚Äòcause this seems like it‚Äôs gonna take a while.‚Äù</p>

            <p>And I <i>certainly</i> haven&#39;t read them in the proper order. But I still really loved this interlude! It was really sweet, and it&#39;s always nice to see something go right for agents. They usually have to put up with so much garbage. And this seemed like a very nice, satisfying conclusion to the hints of romance that appeared in the stories I read. Even though I didn&#39;t see everything about these two, this was still a good read.</p>

            <p>&quot;So, how may I be of service?&quot; Chef Matt leaned against the kitchen entrance. He wore a stained apron that seemed to hug his corpulent body a little too much, a bandana on his head, and his glasses had a few specks of flour on them. Strapped to his belt were a ladle, a spatula, and several spice bottles resting comfortably in small holsters.<br><br>Agent Jones was bouncing on the balls of her feet, gripping a small stack of photos so hard that there were already visible crumples on them. Her partner, Agent Grey, was standing in the back, fiddling with a pack of cigarettes, completely uninterested in the conversation.<br><br>&quot;We need a cake,&quot; she stated, almost pressing the photos into the chef&#39;s hands. &quot;A big one! Suitable for a wedding!&quot;<br><br>Matt cocked an eyebrow as he looked over the photos. All of them showed wedding cakes of various shapes, sizes and colours. Some with overly excessive floral decorations, other with funny crown figurines of the bride and the groom. Some had the names on them, some didn&#39;t. Some were singular, some had many layers on them.<br><br>&quot;And those are...?&quot; Matt asked.<br><br>&quot;References!&quot; VJ beamed. &quot;Lottie&#39;s getting married and I want to give her something to make this special day even sweeter!&quot;<br><br>&quot;You&#39;re just salty ya didn&#39; get an invitation, ain&#39;t you, love?&quot; asked William, breaking the seal on the new package. &quot;Told ya, they must&#39;ve their reasons.&quot;<br><br>VJ rolled her eyes and turned her head sharply. &quot;I <i>know</i> that, Will! But if I can&#39;t be there, at least I can send them something, can&#39;t I? All I&#39;m asking is that you magic the cake to them, when it&#39;s done!&quot;<br><br>William shrugged, and VJ turned back to Matt. &quot;So?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I don&#39;t need those.&quot; The chef dropped the photos into the nearest batch of Slop‚Ñ¢. The paper started bubbling and quickly dissolved into a goop that matched the &#39;dish&#39; in both colour and consistency.<br><br>&quot;You want the Perfect Wedding Cake, you&#39;ll get the Perfect Wedding Cake. The softest, moistest, most refreshing, yet filling, cake your mind can think of.&quot; Matt clapped his hands, opening the kitchen door. Immediately, sounds of cooking, chopping, and gun shots could be heard. A cloud of something glittery escaped through the door.<br><br>The Chef turned his head to his customers. &quot;Just give me a little over an hour. And no peeking.&quot;</p>

            <p>It came to my attention a few hours ago that against my desires one of my works was linked on TvTropes, which as this community historically knows makes it impossible to remove anything from once it&#39;s been added to their site. <br><br>Thanks for enforcing your claim to my existence against my will and continuing to force the connection to this community on me, especially considering this was posted to that site well after you as a group went out of your way to lead a witchhunt on me, dox me, and do your best to destroy my reputation and ruin my life in general. <br><br>I&#39;m so displeased about this I don&#39;t even have the words to properly put it down via keyboard. <br><br>I&#39;m declaring all of my works out of continuity immediately, removing everything I can personally access, and expect all articles and links on the wiki and elsewhere to be appropriately purged.</p>

            <p>July obviously has the right to request this, as would any other current or former PPCer (though heaven help us if Jay or Acy ever try it...!).<br><br>The Wiki pages for all of July&#39;s characters that I can see (three agents, plus four kids) have been wiped back to their ledes and marked as Out-of-Continuity (someone had already done this, I&#39;m not claiming all the credit). The level of deletion is by specific request elsewhere.<br><br>I&#39;ve also removed mention of July and Library from the Coffee Lounge and Nurse Asclepius&#39; pages; as free-to-use concepts, they remain around, but without their sources.<br><br>I won&#39;t be removing mentions from other agents&#39; pages (they worked with Trojie and Pads, for instance), but anything that is solo July is removed.<br><br>I will be poking through the various pages linking to missions when I get a chance to try and remove them.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>July... Are you sure the person who created this link was a member of the PPC? I mean, editing a Tv Tropes page isn&#39;t something limited to the members of a community tied to the subject of the pages, Random Fan can happen, and I&#39;d like to know how you have known it was a member of the community who posted this link? I tried to search for the pseudo (The Otaku Ninja) used by the troper, and I didn&#39;t see any signs linking this pseudo to someone here on the wiki, the Board or the Discord.</p>

            <p>When the first parts originally went up,  someone brought up linking it on TvTropes. I said no, because I don&#39;t like the website for a variety of reasons.<br><br>While I understand you might not have seen that request when it happened, you still went a step further by linking it on said website <i>after</i> I had been victimized and ran out of this community, which is still a serious point of contention for me. <br><br>The current corner of the internet I spend time in has former PPCers of all stripes and people who know about the PPC in it, and there have been moments of &#39;Oh aren&#39;t you y&#39;, which happens, especially if you&#39;ve been using the same handle as long as I have (roughly sixteen years). Having it happen from someone who isn&#39;t a current or former PPCer except for reading things only off of TvTropes and is still under the assumption I am still part of your community is not great. <br><br>My posting this was not intended to set off drama or anything else. As a content creator I have the right to remove my works and expect requests to have them removed respected. I didn&#39;t want to quietly remove them only for them to go right back up. <br><br>I don&#39;t care if people keep their own private offline copies or share them via email, but I am still removing what I can online to further distance myself, since it&#39;s been shown that letting my PPC works just be is not the option I would prefer it to be.<br><br>That said, thank you for standing up and admitting you were the person who added it to the TvTropes website. It would have been very easy to not admit to anything at all. </p>
