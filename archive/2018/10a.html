It&#39;s a song from the 80s, entirely SFW. Folks who participate get virtual Lichtgoodies. :)<br><br>About submitting the audio, make sure that you record in such a way that the song isn&#39;t in the background, e.g. by listening to it with headphones plugged in while you audio record on another device. That way, the result is just us singing it, rather than alongside the original vocalists.<br><br>Also, I&#39;m thinking of splitting up the verses into solos, based on each line. Comment if you want to be one of those, and which one.<br><br>Finally, I&#39;d like it if a few of you tried doing the backup vocals, to balance us out as an ensemble. Thanks.<br><br>-Twistey</p>

            <p>Hi guys,<br><br>I&#39;m taking this one off. If anyone else wants to come up with some prompts for this fortnight feel free. I&#39;d only ask that you respect 2 things:<br>1) Post them in response to this post, don&#39;t make new Board posts for each time someone comes up with a prompt. <br>2) No more than 4 prompts max. A selection is nice, but not too many please.<br><br>I will probably return to doing prompts in two weeks, we will have to see. <br><br>Novastorme </p>

            <p>Don&#39;t bottle &#39;em up, let them out. You can contact me via my email (which should be clickable) or on Discord (you&#39;ll see me on the PPC server). Let me know if you have any prompts you want to see answered by people here. I&#39;d be more than happy to have a look at them and probably use them at some point.

            <p>Voila.<br><br>-----<br>It was a long day at work. Writing clickbait titles and BuzzFeed quizzes could only be so satisfying. Camille was tired, and unfulfilled. But after years of research, things would finally look up. It was astonishing how little real journalism there was on demonology.<br><br>She stopped by Whole Foods on her way back. Microwave-safe ramen (too many fires) and some fruit (notably three different types of apples), it was a short walk from her studio apartment. She opened the gate and walked up the stairs, unlocked her space and shut the door behind her. The deadbolt slid back with a firm click.<br><br>The space had been prepped in advance. Candles, chalk, a little potpourri. The whole shabang. She took out an apple out of her bag, and spoke some old Latin words. She took the blade in her left hand, and cut into the apple. A thick, deep red blood began to ooze out. She nearly dropped the knife. Nothing happened.<br><br>She waited. And waited. And waited.<br>&quot;Well, sh-&quot;<br>A rumble shook her room. She nearly fell.<br>Bigger and louder, they increased. She braced herself.<br><br>With an explosion and fire, the side of her wall burst open as if it were a portal, and twenty void black humanoid creatures rushed in, and started tearing the place apart. Twirling and swirling, inspecting every nook and cranny. Looking deeply and curiously at this new human they had been met with.<br><br>A louder explosion, and they all dropped to their knees. A young woman, oozing with power and status walked through the wall, bearing a briefcase. She opened it, and the contents were glorious. Camille reached for it, but was restrained.<br><br>A contract. A quill. A signature in blood.<br>Then came the burning onto Camille&#39;s back of a sigil, a black rune of power. The pain was almost unbearable, but it was worth it.<br><br>And with a bang, everything disappeared but Camille, laying on the floor. The only trace of what had happened was the destruction and the smell of burning. <br><br>It had been a long last day at work. Camille got up, renewed, and walked out the door.<br><br>-----<br><br>A character I&#39;ve been thinking about, but haven&#39;t really used ever. Maybe I&#39;ll write more later. Hope you enjoyed.<br><br>-Helsinki</p>

            <p>Therefore, I&#39;d better do this one. Should probably have warnings for something, but I&#39;m not sure exactly what.<br><br><br>Francis sat at the desk, reading through a copy of the latest magi-scientific journal. The paper on Elvish societies wasn’t really the sort of thing that interested him, but he made a point of reading every article. You never knew when the information might come in handy.<br><br>On the floor in front of him, Tiger and Holly were playing a board game, or trying to: each of them kept accusing the other of cheating. They were both as bad as each other, or as good as each other, depending on your point of view.<br><br>The door suddenly jerked open. Francis looked up from the journal to see Alice standing in the door, looking absolutely furious.<br><br>“Hello, dear,” he said calmly, wondering what had set off her red-hot temper this time.<br><br>“Don’t you “dear” me, you evil man!” shouted Alice.<br><br>“What makes you think I’m evil?” asked Francis, as if curiously.<br><br>“Oh, I couldn’t possibly guess. Maybe… I don’t know… hiring an assassin to eliminate your rival?”<br><br>Francis was surprised – how on earth had she known that? – but he concealed it effortlessly. “I – I don’t know what you’re talking about.” He knew it was no use trying to talk his way out of this, but he could buy himself a bit of time.<br><br>“Really?” she said. “Then what is this?”<br><br>She pulled a document out of her pocket, unfolded it, and threw it onto his desk.<br><br>Francis merely moved it aside so he could continue reading. He already knew what the document said: it was an agreement between himself and one of the best assassins in the land to, as Alice had put it, “eliminate his rival” in exchange for generous payment.<br><br>“Well?” said Alice furiously. “What have you got to say for yourself?”<br><br>“I’d appreciate it if you didn’t pry into my secret documents.”<br><br>That was enough for Alice to snap. She began yelling terrible words, spells to strike fear into even Francis’s heart.<br><br>Objects all around arose to do Alice’s bidding, and flung themselves at Francis. His drawer sprung out and the dagger in it leaped up.<br><br>He was only just able to duck in time to avoid it hitting his throat. Instead, it dug into his cheek. He pulled it out and hastily said a protective charm, blocking Alice’s magic from coming within a metre of him.<br><br>Then he felt his cheek. His hand came away covered in blood. He knew it would take all of his magic to heal a wound made with his own dagger, and that the scar would never fade. “I think you’re being a bit of a hypocrite, Alice. That was pretty evil magic you just used.<br><br>He heard a scream from outside and saw Holly running away on her tiny legs, abandoning the board. Tiger, too, retreated to a safe distance, and then asked “Mummy, why are you hurting Daddy?”<br><br>Alice ignored him and said: “Right. That’s it. I’ve had enough. I’m leaving.”<br><br>“Fine,” said Francis, reaching for a handkerchief to mop the blood off his cheek. “Goodbye.”<br><br>Alice looked startled at his rather unemotional reaction. “Come on, children,” she said, but neither Tiger nor Holly moved.<br></p>

            <p>Because I can. Trigger warnings for allusions to rape.<br><br><br>“What’s your name?” 8386071 asked the sweating, trembling young man. An angry red scar was seared on his chest; he’d been recently implanted.<br><br>“Coryn,” the man said. “You?”<br><br>8386071 shrugged. “No name, just a number. They call me the Scorpion in the arena, but only because my number’s a mouthful to say. Those of us who were born here ain’t got names. Where are you from, Coryn?”<br><br>“Ord Mantell.”<br><br>8386071 frowned, trying to remember the stories he’d heard from the other slaves. “That’s… er…”<br><br>“Bright Jewel system, Mid Rim,” Coryn said. “I was a soldier in the civil war and got sold as a prisoner.”<br><br>“Civil war?” 8386071 decided not to tell Coryn he had no idea where any of those places were supposed to be.<br><br>“Gods, they really don’t tell you lot anything, do they?” Coryn drew his knees up to his chest, staring out the barred window that opened to the sandy arena outside. The sleeping quarters were vacant; everyone else was training, the dull thud-thud of the wooden practice weapons resonating as they hit their targets.<br><br>“Not really, no,” 8386071 said. “It’s… well, I’d be lying if I said it ain’t so bad, but stories I hear from the other gladiators, other places have it loads worse than we do. Just avoid Harkon and his men when they’re in a bad mood, say ‘yessir’ and ‘no sir’, and don’t ask for second helpings, and you should be alright.”<br><br>Coryn let out a barking laugh. “Oh, and that’s supposed to make me feel better about having my freedom ripped away from me?”<br><br>“Well… no,” 8386071 said slowly, “but—”<br><br>“But what? I wouldn’t expect you to understand what it was like,” Coryn said bitterly. “I’m never going to see my family again. I had a little girl, a daughter, my Yalena…” He reached up to wipe his eyes, and 8386071 hesitated before offering him a corner of his blanket. Coryn pressed it to his face, shoulders beginning to shake.<br><br>“I’ll help you,” 8386071 said quietly. “We all will.”<br><br>“What, escape?”<br><br>“Survive.”<br><br>Coryn shook his head, setting the blanket aside. “Live as a slave,” he muttered disdainfully.<br><br>Footsteps echoed in the hall outside and a strange gleam came into Coryn’s eye. <br><br>A key scraped in the lock.<br><br>“Or die free!” Coryn yelled, throwing himself at the door.<br><br>“CORYN, NO!” 8386071 bolted after him, heart pounding as Coryn plowed through Harkon and Ra’viss, knocking them over. 8386071 leapt over their prone forms. “You’re going to get yourself killed!”<br><br>Harkon climbed to his feet and pulled out his detonator.<br><br>“CORYN—!”<br><br>And then everything went white.<br><br><br><i>“He’s fading fast.”<br><br>“More blood!<br><br>“I don’t know if it’s possible to save him, the damage is too—”<br><br>“SILENCE! I won’t have my prize gladiator dead because you imbeciles can’t attach a new arm!”<br><br>Drifting. Pain. Ringing.<br><br>“Why his eye, though? They’re both undamaged.”<br><br>“Might as well upgrade him while you’re here.”<br><br>“Understood.”<br><br>Stabbing. Gouging. Tearing.<br><br>Searing. Scorching. Burning.<br><br>Nothing.</i><br><br><br>When he woke up, he was back in the sleeping quarters, and for a moment, he thought it was all a dream, until he realized that this was a different room than the one they normally stayed in, and it was crowded with twice the usual number of people.<br><br>“Hey, look, the Scorpion’s awake!” Mako called, and there was a sudden rustle as people turned to look.<br><br>8386071 blinked up at them blearily. Something about his vision was off. It was… half red. His body felt heavy. His face itched and his arm felt like it was on fire.<br><br>“Are you alright?” Dinah asked anxiously. Worry creased her face. Her voice felt off, tinny, almost, and yet more clear than he’d ever heard before. Sounds were sharper.<br><br>8386071 tried to speak, but his voice rasped. <br><br>There was a faint splashing noise, and then Jeyla was there, holding a rag to his lips and squeezing water into his mouth. He sucked it down gratefully.<br><br>He blinked again. It felt… wrong. Only one eye was blinking. But he could see out of both of them?<br><br>“What happened?” 8386071 croaked.<br><br>“You know damn well what happened!” Mako snapped. “You idiot, thought you’d chase down the newcomer and what, hold him down? Nearly got yourself killed when he detonated! If you weren’t so injured, I’d beat you myself!”<br><br>“That’s enough, Mako,” 427787 snapped.<br><br>Mako folded his arms, glaring at 8386071.<br><br>“You lost your right arm,” Jeyla said. “And your left eye. I’m not sure what else they had to repair…”<br><br>8386071 forced his head to turn. The dull grey metal of his new arm weakly reflected the sunlight and bounced back up in his face. He closed his eyes. Eye. The other one wasn’t so bothered by the glare, and he could feel its vibrations in his skull as he looked sideways with it. He could see worried and angry faces, but that wasn’t all—beating hearts, pulsing arteries, and heaving lungs were now visible, hot red in contrast to the pale redness of the room.<br><br>He looked back up at the ceiling. “How long before I’m back in the arena?” he asked. It was the only thing he could think to say in that moment. He’d process what had happened to him later.<br><br>“Don’t know, kid,” 427787 said. “You’re already back to good condition from what we heard, but the Master doesn’t want you out in the arena until you’re used to the upgrades. And because of that… well, I’ve got bad news for you.”<br><br>8386071’s mouth went dry. “No…”<br><br>“The Master’s decided to bump your breeding ahead of schedule,” Mako said. “Since you’re useless in a fight for the moment, he figured he’s going to put you to work in bed.” He laughed. “Have fun, kid. First time always is.”</p>

            <p>It is well known that one of the most popular activities for girls in Middle-earth is joining the Fellowship of the Ring and saving the day; I mean, given a choice between that and dying of dysentery, wouldn&#39;t <i>you</i>?<br><br>Most female Walkers are Suvians, of course, but a while back Kaitlyn and Selene took on <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vR38NMZCar7U8nRHXPYyuFL6jyqFPjpgyTXfGOLsQNpsvqqama2OiOYKjnHdMFeUj6gSJvMlZRcM60Y/pub">a fic where Rosie, Diamond, and Estella</a> tried to join the Ringbearer&#39;s party. That got me thinking: is there a way to get a woman into the Fellowship that <i>works</i>?<br><br>In fact (thought I), let&#39;s go for broke: is there a way to get <b>nine</b> women into the Fellowship?<br><br>The answer, it turned out, was (at least in the Movieverse) yes:<br><br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/tJE2zlC.png"><br>(deviantArt: <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/huinesoron/art/Fellowship-of-the-Ring-The-Inopportune-Storm-765323900">The Inopportune Storm: The Fellowship of the Ring</a>)<br><br>The full account of how this came about is up on deviantArt, but a quick summary goes like this:<br><br><hr>
<br><br>While Boromir was riding to Rivendell, a storm (sent by Sauron) over Rohan broke his arm. Eowyn took up his message, going to the elves in Lothlorien, where Galadriel chose to escort her to Rivendell.<br><br>The storm headed through Mirkwood (where it made the woods dangerous enough that Legolas took Tauriel along with him to Rivendell), crossed the Misty Mountains (flooding the passes and causing Dis, sister of Thorin, to break her journey back to Erebor in Rivendell), and hit the Shire just as Frodo and Sam were leaving Bag-End.<br><br>The weather forced them to spend the night at the Green Dragon, where Sam spilled the beans to Rosie. She told her friends, Angelica Baggins (devoted but vain niece of Bilbo) and Pearl Took (Pippin&#39;s older sister, <a href="http://askmiddlearth.tumblr.com/post/117161589528/heres-the-second-part-of-my-awesome-ladies-of-the">probable political assassin</a>), and the trio decided to chase the boys down at Bree. (No Merry and Pip in this one; their chance Movieverse encounter never happens.)<br><br>At Bree, Pearl gets attacked by the Nazgul, leading Aragorn to take the five Hobbits into the Old Forest seeking help. Goldberry tends to Pearl - and when Pearl refuses to leave her friends, Goldberry comes along with them.<br><br>Aragorn leads what&#39;s now a party of seven (including himself) to Weathertop, but the size of the group + Pearl&#39;s injury means everything&#39;s a little bit slower. Long story short, Frodo dies on the banks of Bruinen, with Arwen unable to save him.<br><br>At the Council, Bilbo pulls his Bookverse trick of trying to take up the Quest... but this time it&#39;s Angelica who steps in to take the Ring instead of him. The rest of the Nine each have their own reasons for going (Rosie &amp; Pearl to stay with Angelica, Goldberry to stay with Pearl, Arwen to spend time with Galadriel, Dis to spend time with Tauriel, and Eowyn is heading that way anyway), and the Fellowship is declared.<br><br><hr>
<br><br>So far, that&#39;s where the story ends. For the Middle-earth types on the Board (whatever your degree of knowledge or lack thereof): how do you think this Fellowship&#39;s story would go? Would having all of the bearers of the Three in Rivendell help in their planning? Would Galadriel try and take them over Caradhras (and if so, would the fact that she, Arwen, and Goldberry all have a magical connection to water mean they could avert the snowstorm?)? Would Angelica, whose only canon trait is being so vain that Bilbo left her a mirror, be able to stand up to the strain of the Ring? What would happen when a trio of (essentially) water-mages ran into trouble along the Anduin? Precisely how dead would the Lord of the Nazgul be?<br><br>And, perhaps most importantly: in the inevitable, endless fanfic, who would the fans relentlessly ship together?<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Galadriel is there to say &quot;No, that&#39;s a terrible idea.

And even if things were okay when she left, and she fully believed they would have nothing but support, she would be wrong by the time they got there.

            <p>It&#39;s worth noting that Galadriel and Treebeard have met before, though not for a long time. From RotK:<br><br><i>Then Treebeard said farewell to each of them in turn, and he bowed three times slowly and with great reverence to Celeborn and Galadriel. ‘It is long, long since we met by stock or by stone, A vanimar, vanimálion nostari!’ he said. ‘It is sad that we should meet only thus at the ending. For the world is changing: I feel it in the water, I feel it in the earth, and I smell it in the air. I do not think we shall meet again.’<br><br>And Celeborn said: ‘I do not know, Eldest.’ But Galadriel said: ‘Not in Middle-earth, nor until the lands that lie under the wave are lifted up again. Then in the willow-meads of Tasarinan we may meet in the Spring. Farewell!’</i><br><br>Significantly, Galadriel&#39;s line here quotes Treebeard&#39;s song back in TTT, which means she&#39;s had contact with him since the First Age. Add in the fact that the forest is literally named after him, and she definitely knows he lives there.<br><br>So, knowing that Saruman has turned, would Galadriel consider taking Isengard out of the picture? With Eowyn at her side, she could definitely pull together a three-pronged attack (Rohan, Lorien, Fangorn) - and with Goldberry (and movie!Arwen) there, she might be able to count on the River Isen itself helping out.<br><br>Of course, doing that would require some assurance that Sauron wouldn&#39;t move against Lorien while the army was out - Dol Guldur is close enough to do that. And this is where EAIUO&#39;s point comes in: what about the guys?<br><br>Well, how about we send out a <i>second</i> Fellowship, with a different goal: to contact Mirkwood and Erebor (and the Beornings, for that matter) and get them to attack Dol Guldur. That&#39;s something Gandalf could do - he&#39;s got Gimli and Legolas to hand, remember - and it&#39;s an excellent way of drawing Sauron&#39;s eye away from the Ringbearer&#39;s party.<br><br>We know from canon that both of these attacks could work: that Erebor+Mirkwood were able to at least hold off the armies of Dol Guldur, and that Rohan+the Ents were able to defeat Isengard. So this could be an opportunity to weaken Sauron, distract him, and keep his attention away from the Ring (now hurrying through Rohan).<br><br>Slight problem, though: when Sauron gets stirred up, he&#39;s going to start moving armies out of Morgul and Mordor. That could mean Gondor gets hit, unsupported in this timeline. It could also mean that the full strength of Mordor moves north, waging a war of annihilation on the Lonely Mountain and the Woodland Realm. At minimum, it means the Mountains of Shadow are going to be crawling with Orcs, leaving the Fellowship without an obvious way in.<br><br>Hmm... one possibility is, rather than crossing Rohan, the Fellowship could <i>keep</i> going south. The bulk of Gondor isn&#39;t under much threat (at least while Minas Tirith stands), and if they cross Anduin and head up the Poros, it looks like the mountains might be low enough to let them cross into Nurn. That would let them sneak into Mordor &#39;the back way&#39;, while Sauron&#39;s armies were all heading out the front.<br><br>Of course, this is now becoming a longer and longer journey. I estimate it as at least 1500 miles. The canon trip from Rivendell is around 1000 miles, and took 3 months; this would take nearly 5. They might succeed, but I&#39;m not at all sure there would be a Middle-earth left to save.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>EAIUO said something about the Three Rings being in the party, and that got me thinking, even if it&#39;s just Galadriel with Nenya, would Sauron notice if it leaves Lothlórien? The Elven-rings are hidden from him, but Nenya&#39;s power is part of what makes Lórien the refuge it is, right? If the ring isn&#39;t there, suddenly it&#39;s more exposed, more vulnerable.<br><br>Gandalf potentially giving Narya to Éowyn is an interesting idea, because its power to inspire and put heart in people is very useful when you need people to keep fighting against overwhelmingly bad odds. On the other hand, if it stays with the Other Fellowship and joins the fight of Mirkwood and Erebor against Dol Guldur, does it help them win that fight more decisively? Could those factions then proceed south to come to Rohan&#39;s and Gondor&#39;s aid?<br><br>Meanwhile, what does Nenya&#39;s influence mean for the main Fellowship? Does it let them move with greater secrecy, perhaps? Can they slip through the Gap of Rohan unnoticed by Saruman and reach Meduseld in good time to bring Th&amp;eacuteoden around and get the Rohirrim into the fight? Or, if not Théoden, since Gandalf (with Narya) isn&#39;t there to stir his heart, perhaps they just get Éomer on board and stage a bit of a rebellion?<br><br>~Neshomeh has more questions than answers.</p>

            <p>Obligatory sheet-anchor: this all goes back to the powers of the Three, about which we have few firm statements. So I&#39;m going to have to speculate quite a bit here. We do know that all three could <i>ward off the decays of time and postpone the weariness of the world</i> (&#39;Of the Rings of Power&#39;).<br><br>Nenya is the Ring of Adamant, and is also connected to water (hence its name). We know, or think, that it directly protected Lothlorien, as well as altering the flow of time there.<br><br>We know that Sauron and Galadriel directly contended (Galadriel mentions it at the Mirror), but I don&#39;t know that he can have the same sort of interaction with Lorien as a whole. Certainly if Dol Guldur came out to attack the Golden Wood, they&#39;d notice a difference, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s necessarily true to say Sauron could perceive it from a distance.<br><br>Narya is the Ring of Fire, and Cirdan helpfully tells us (well, Gandalf) exactly what it does:<br><br><i>...but in all it will support thee and defend thee from weariness. For this is the Ring of Fire, and herewith, maybe, thou shalt rekindle hearts to the valour of old in a world that grows chill.</i> (&#39;Of the Rings of Power&#39;)<br><br>So you&#39;re exactly right that Narya could help in the battles of the North. Would that help save Gondor? I feel like the time-lag might mean they only get there to interrupt the Orcs&#39; victory feast - though if the Lord of the Nazgul was elsewhere, Minas Tirith could probably stand a long siege, so that&#39;s a possible.<br><br>Whether Gandalf would surrender Nenya to Eowyn is an interesting question, but on balance I think not. Galadriel said:<br><br><i>Did not Gandalf tell you that the rings give power according to the measure of each possessor? Before you could use that power you would need to become far stronger, and to train your will to the domination of others.</i> (FotR)<br><br>While Gandalf might <i>like</i> to send Narya with the Fellowship, none of the members of the party would be able to wield it effectively. (The same, sadly, goes for giving Vilya to Arwen.)<br><br>But Nenya is definitely there, and Galadriel <i>does</i> imply that its powers include hiding. It&#39;s also thematically appropriate for water to be a concealment - this goes back to Tuor, who was given a cloak of invisibility by Ulmo. So yes, they probably <i>could</i> get through the Gap unseen.<br><br>Without Gandalf, I think you&#39;re right that Theoden would be too &#39;help help, I&#39;m old and feeble&#39; to do much good - but without a month&#39;s stay in Lorien, the Fellowship would reach Rohan long before the Battle of the Fords of Isen. Saruman wouldn&#39;t yet have openly declared his army of Uruks - and Theodred, Theoden&#39;s son, would still be alive.<br><br>It is noteworthy that at this time, there was no First Marshal of the Mark - the position of &#39;supreme commander&#39; of Rohan lay fallow (because of Theoden&#39;s weakness and Grima&#39;s influence). But the Second and Third Marshals, Theodred and Eomer, showed that they were <i>definitely</i> willing to take the fight to Isengard.<br><br>The image I&#39;m getting here is of a War of the Ring made up not of brief, heroic battles, but of a string of sieges. The North lays siege to Dol Guldur. Rohan lays siege to Isengard. Sauron, alerted by Saruman, sends out his own armies and besieges Minas Tirith. And all of this takes place in January (yikes!). The armies of southern Gondor have not yet been mustered - but nor have Sauron&#39;s Southrons and Easterlings (and Corsairs) arrived. They&#39;ll be trickling in over the next couple of months, and who arrives where and when is likely to be critical.<br><br>One thing I&#39;m even surer of now is that the Fellowship has to go through South Gondor. Ithilien is going to fall quickly, and everything east of Anduin and north of Minas Tirith is going to be stuffed with Orcs. The only hope of maintaining secrecy is to get down to what Sauron thinks of as the back-lines, and hope to avoid all the troops coming up from the south.<br><br>(Which may not be as hard as I&#39;d supposed; I forgot the month in Lorien when I worked out the timings before. I think, if all goes well, they&#39;ll still hit Mordor sometime in March.)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I think Gandalf would still insist on accompanying the fellowship as Sauron was his Enemy.  But another thing that might have changed is, there may have been two of Elven Rings of Power in this new fellowship.<br><br>Galadriel has Nenya<br><br>But it is possible that both Vilya and Narya may have changed hands.  If Gandalf could not accompany the fellowship, given that Cirdan gave Narya to Gandalf because he knew who he was and what his goal was and that it was given to him to help defeat Sauron, he may have passed it to another possible wielder, possibly Goldberry.  <br><br>It might also not be to far to believe that Elrond may have transferred Vilya to Arwen, though perhaps not.  Having all three Elven Rings in one party might be a risky idea. <br><br>I do think that if they still had to go through Moria, I think that the encounter with Durin&#39;s Bane would be different.  Galadriel could solo it like Gandalf, but given the way Goldberry/Tom Bombadil are portrayed they appear to be somewhat close to the Maia, so Goldberry would probably be able to help.  Also the Elves are strong enough that alone Arwen (without Vilya) would probably not be able to, but with Tauriel the two Elves may be able to assist.  Alternatively if Arwen was granted either Vilya or Narya she might be able to help as well.  But short version Durin&#39;s Bane would be facing between 2 and 4 opponents, quite possibly keeping all 9 members together for Amon Hen.  <br><br>I do not think Angelica would be able to resist the influence like Frodo did, because we know it is incredibly corrupting and we do not know enough about her to make a decision.  However, with both Goldberry and Galadrial present I think it would be able to be resisted.     </p>

If somebody wants to use their words economically, shouldn’t they try to avoid having to add explanations after the fact?&quot;<br><br><i>Agent Hieronymus, you are daydreaming again.

<br>Yeah, sorry about that (and for being late). Using some more words, like &quot;... promptly fell off the tree while Alex fell to the dirt ...&quot; might work better there.<br><br>Also, I feel like there is a word missing in <i>Ce’rana stared after him for a moment, <b>then the tool</b> in her hands ...</i>. (&quot;at the tool&quot;?  Certainly not &quot;after the tool&quot;, which might be implied by leaving it out.)<br><br><i><b>Aira</b> pulled back from Herobrine, then punched him in the stomach.</i><br>Is that a mini-Sue? <br><br><i>Herobrine Melody, you <b>here</b> hereby charged with being a demigod within a system having no mechanics to facilitate such a thing,</i><br>Should be &quot;are&quot;.<br><br>I don’t know anything about <i>Minecraft</i>, or <i>The Belgariad</i>, or the <i>Fate</i> series (titles should be italicized, BTW, or de-italicized in an italicized disclaimer), so I don’t really have anything to say other than: I could mostly follow the events in this mission, and I may like to see how these agents develop further.<br><br>HG</p>

            <p><i>Minecraft</i> isn&#39;t really a property I&#39;m familiar with at all, so while I can&#39;t say for sure, I at least <i>feel</i> like you&#39;ve done a good job of analyzing this story in terms of what is and isn&#39;t correct for <i>Minecraft</i>.<br><br>I&#39;m having difficulty putting my thoughts about the agents into words.  On the one hand, neither one feels like they dominate the narrative or the relationship all the way through, which is good.  They both take turns being the leader from scene to scene, and keeping the other&#39;s worse impulses in check.  On the other hand . . . again, I feel like I&#39;m not phrasing my feelings properly, but it doesn&#39;t feel to me like they&#39;re quite a team?  I get the impression they&#39;re working together in order to get the job done, rather than because working together is what they do?  But this is all ultimately a first impression, I realize both agents need more appearances to really reveal themselves to us readers.  So don&#39;t take this is a criticism so much as an observation.<br><br>One thing in your analysis I&#39;m not really agreeing with is Herobrine and Aria being related.  Unless the fic calls Herobrine and Steve brothers frequently in parts of the story you didn&#39;t quote, I really feel like that line from the beginning, when Herobrine calls Steve his &quot;twin&quot; was metaphorical.  I think it&#39;s pointing out how Steve and Herobrine are sort of two sides of the same coin, with Steve being a creative force and Herobrine a destructive one, and with both overlaying the same character model.  That said, our missions do have a long history of interpreting things literally, so I think the mission still stands fine with that detail included.<br><br>A couple of small details I really liked were:<br>1. The book ends of the castle being built and then destroyed in Alex&#39;s game.<br>2. That the removal of Herobrine&#39;s mansion is done through means available to regular <i>Minecraft</i> players: a combination of deconstructing parts and using explosives.  Very appropriate!<br><br>Welcome to doctorlit&#39;s list of typos:<br><br><i>&quot;And what is it that you have been working on?&quot; she <b>countered</b> seamlessly as she stepped closer . . .</i><br>A minor quibble, but I wouldn&#39;t personally use &quot;countered&quot; here, since the agents aren&#39;t arguing, just catching either up on their activities.<br><br><i>“Beeper. Stop,” she muttered tiredly, focusing on the <b>immediately-fixable</b> problem.</i><br>Since &quot;immediately&quot; ends in &quot;-ly&quot; it doesn&#39;t need a hyphen connecting it to the word it&#39;s describing.  &quot;immediately fixable&quot; is correct here.<br><br><i>Ce’rana, who had somehow managed to get herself a few blocks off the ground, promptly fell off the tree <b>and Alex to</b> the dirt beneath his feet when the world began rocking back and forth . . .</i><br>I feel like some words got cut from this sentence, because it&#39;s not quite reading clearly to me.  Was it meant to be &quot;fell off the tree and bounced off Alex to the dirt beneath his feet&quot;?<br><br><i>. . . when he became loud enough to <b>potentially</b> attract the attention of the nearby <b>potential</b> canon replacements.</i><br>Paging the RDR, paging the RDR . . .<br><br><i>He guided her until <b>he</b> was sitting down, then crouched next to her.</i><br>I think that&#39;s meant to be &quot;she&quot; for Ce&#39;rana?<br><br><i><b>Ce’nedra</b> turned her face from the thick, green-glowing semi-liquid.</i><br>Where did Ce&#39;rana go?  (I&#39;m guessing this is the name of a canon Dryad from <i>The Belgariad</i>?  The name sounds familiar.)<br><br><i>“I suppose it would depend on your <b>difference</b> of ‘much’,” she conceded.</i><br>&quot;Definition.&quot;<br><br><i>Ce’rana snorted derisively, closing her eyes and <b>leaned</b> back against a tree of her own . . .</i><br>&quot;Leaned&quot; should be &quot;leaning&quot; to match the verb tense of &quot;closing.&quot;  Another option would be adding a comma after &quot;eyes&quot; which would allow all the verbs to stay as they are now, though I think it reads just a little awkwardly that way.<br><br><i>When he looked down, she flattened her <b>fingers</b> and jabbed them straight into his side.</i><br>Aren&#39;t they in <i>Minecraft</i>-style disguises right now?  Does Ce&#39;rana actually have fingers?  Sorry if this one is too silly to have broguht up . . .<br><br><i>The pair listened quietly as Aria recounted her saving of <b>Mille</b> . . .</i><br>I think you wanted &quot;Millie&quot; here, since you treated &quot;Mille&quot; as a mini earlier in the story.  Especially since it&#39;s Aria talking about the character; a Mary Sue wouldn&#39;t have been aware of a mini within their narrative.<br><br><i>The Dryad smiled faintly and stuck her arm through, passing <b>though</b> in full when she realized he had done the portal thing right this time, probably.</i><br>That should be &quot;through,&quot; although I just noticed that also makes &quot;through&quot; appear twice in three words.  Maybe the first &quot;through&quot; could be changed to &quot;in&quot;?<br><br>—doctorlit apologizes for long it took to write this review; it&#39;s been a very sleepy week for him</p>

            <p>To go in order of the points you&#39;ve made, Alex and Ce&#39;rana don&#39;t really feel like a team at this point in time because both of them have the tendency to mentally go &quot;Alright, budge over, if I let you do this it&#39;ll take forever and be wrong anyways&quot; - you know, that feeling I&#39;m sure all of us got during every group project ever? If you think of missions like that, both of them are accustomed to being the one who carries the group, and since there&#39;s almost always only one carrier in a given group, they&#39;re not very used to letting anyone else do anything ever.<br><br>I hadn&#39;t thought of the possible other meaning of the twin thing, and that could genuinely be interesting if portrayed properly! But here... yeah, it&#39;s the Word World, it takes everything literally.<br><br>I&#39;m glad you noticed those little details! Both were Mikel&#39;s idea, and I stand by my personal writing creed on &quot;details make the dream&quot; when other people do it at least as much as when I do. It was wonderful.<br><br>The typos have been fixed, though there are a few that weren&#39;t typos at all - specifically, the first three and the fingers thing. And to explain the third, Ce&#39;rana fell from the tree; Alex fell to the dirt beneath his feet.<br><br>--Calliope says that no one is obligated to read or review, but it is very much appreciated if people do</p>

            <p>I could tell you guys were having fun with the Words literally interpreting the various typos. <br><br>Personally, I’m a fan of the TNT everywhere ending. Imagining that explosion gave me joy.<br><br>I do feel like pointing out—Ce’rana and Alex... have me a bit concerned with how their partnership will end, because of their willingness to threaten (and use) violence against each other. Ce’rana especially, with how she “seriously considered stabbing her partner” several times—there’s a certain point where physical violence crosses from being funny to being concerning, and right now I’ve come out of this wondering if Alex is going to wake up one day with a pencil in his heart. <br><br>(This is the same issue I had with one Sue who thought beating someone over the head with a frying pan made for good slapstick. In a cartoon, yes, but not so much in Middle-earth.)<br><br>Just something to keep in mind going forward, because I’m sure you two are going to have a great number of future missions.</p>

            <p>...that was exactly what we were going for. At least in Ce&#39;rana&#39;s case.<br><br>It&#39;s something of a character point. Something that will have to be worked on and, one day, overcome. There are behind-the-scenes reasons why Alex tolerates her stabby ways instead of telling her to knock it off and doesn&#39;t she know that hurts people?, but not everyone has those reasons. Someday - probably someday rather soon, in-universe - someone else will be around and see this, and they will have Something To Say about it.<br><br>But on the other points:<br><br>We were having <i>so</i> much fun with those. I&#39;m honestly especially proud of the catchup; we like to copy badfics into GDocs and annotate them, which usually ends up with us reading it many, many, many times - which is the only reason we found the incest - but I didn&#39;t notice that until we got to that scene while writing. And it just sort of <i>hit</i> as an amazing thing to throw in. You&#39;ll have to ask Mikel for his favorite, though.<br><br>As for the massive explosives - me too, Ix, me too. The only reason Ce&#39;rana seems upset about it is because she&#39;s a Dryad and those things may not light fires, but they do still explode her tree. Which hurts. A lot.</p>

            <p>I liked this one! As I said <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=319245;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">last week</a>, the pacing still feels excellent - once again, it let them delve a little deeper into the emotions of the week&#39;s cast than we might have otherwise.<br><br>I am also <i>super</i> in favour of All Northern, All The Time <i>Doctor Who</i>. As we know, Lots Of Planets Have A North, so why shouldn&#39;t every alien have a northern accent of some description?<br><br>Like with the Sontaran bait-and-switch last week, this episode also contained shadows of previous stories. A toxic planet filled with murderbots resonates with Skaro, and this is hardly the first time there&#39;s been a literal space race on the show. (Also, if the subtitles were right the Doctor is a Grand Master Pacifist at Venusian Aikido, which is a <i>glorious</i> title.)<br><br>We&#39;re not sure what we think of the new TARDIS design. I&#39;ve dubbed it Crystal Industrial, and am generally in favour (the console looks suitably clunky, and it give me high hopes for Mad Science Doctoring), but agree with Kaitlyn that it was <i>way</i> too dark. Even after they turned the lights on, I couldn&#39;t see anything beyond the pillars, which is fine if you&#39;ve only got one companion, but is going to strain things a little with three.<br><br>I am totally in favour, however, of the Doctor whispering to <s>Sexy</s> her TARDIS and it opening the door for her. Amazing.<br><br>Final note, still from the TARDIS scene: when the Doctor was telling the trio about it, her expression was a perfect &#39;I really hope you like it&#39;. Normally we get that expressed through dialogue, so having it so clearly written on her face was a good thing to see.<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>Non-spoilery opener: loved it. We managed to get the kids to sit through almost all of it (one never looked away, the other had to climb up next to me 15 minutes in), which bodes very well.<br><br>More spoilery thoughts:<br><br>-Mad inventor Doctor! I am <i>so</i> on board for mad inventor Doctor. In fact... come to think of it, my own female incarnation, <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JYZ7eqTClNA4Y7rMd_q1Gw7FfkVLrQXQqO07wUqiTtE/edit">the Fifth Alchemist</a>, was the mad scientist one. Is there something about Time Ladies that predisposes them to mad science?<br><br>-No TARDIS! I&#39;ve been muttering since midway through Ten&#39;s run that we need a new version of the UNIT years - the Doctor stranded on Earth without her TARDIS - and this episode validates my opinion. ^<em>^ This blends really well with the mad inventor aspect; come on, wouldn&#39;t you love to watch Thirteen roaming around Britain in semi-official capacity, commandeering workshops wherever she goes?<br><br>-I loved the Sontaran-Rutan bait-and-switch, because yes, &#39;armoured angry alien versus glowing amorphous ball thing&#39; is not a new concept in <i>Doctor Who</i>. The fact that they highlighted that, and then discarded it as an incorrect conclusion, was excellent.<br><br>-I feel like they paced it really well, with the new format. What I said to Kaitlyn was that it felt like they&#39;d written a 50-minute episode, then gone back and allowed themselves to linger on the emotional, not-plot-relevant moments in a way that worked really well. Hopefully they can keep that up; my worry is that writers who previously worked on the 40 minute format might end up stretching their scripts to fit.<br><br>~<br><br>And now, a quick game of Let&#39;s Be Offended, the game where you find reasons to take offence that look reasonable at a glance, but are actually ludicrous:<br><br>-Too much Northern representation. How am I supposed to empathise with the characters if none of them are from London?!<br><br>-Far too many Baby Boomers; pandering much, Auntie Beeb?

            <p>I could see the Detective getting pulled into the situation surprisingly easily. <br><br>He&#39;d be disgruntled and snarky about  all the&quot;Time Lord bureaucracy&quot;and whatnot, obviously, since he&#39;s probably violently allergic to paperwork and procedure (Which mean scenes between the Detective and the Notary ought to be especially interesting :P). <br><br>But he would most definitely be interested in figuring out why she went missing. He doesn&#39;t call himself the Detective for nothing, after all. <br><br>I could also see him being very attracted to the Council afterwards, given that strange and mysterious things for him to puzzle out have a tendency to happen with a healthy regularity when it comes to their meetings. <br><br>The Detective runs pell-mell into the room. <br><br>&quot;So sorry I&#39;m late.

            <p>But I think the Boorman script was actually a licensed adaptation for a little bit. So even though plans fell through (thank <i>Eru</i>) it still holds a position somewhere more canonical than fanfic but less canonical than other adaptations. The mission for it addresses its sort of pseudo-canonical state.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m going to preface this with a disclaimer: I&#39;ve never played D&amp;D. But I think I can still recognize an awful movie when I see one. And spoilers, I guess?<br><br>Alright, so there are three of them: <i>Dungeons and Dragons</i>, <i>Dungeons and Dragons: Wrath of the Dragon God</i>, and <i>Dungeons and Dragons: The Book of Vile Darkness</i>. <i>Dungeons and Dragons</i>, amusingly enough, was produced by New Line Cinema and released only one year before <i>The Fellowship of the Ring</i>, one of the best movies and movie adaptations I&#39;ve ever seen. I guess they were saving all the good stuff for that. So it follows the adventures of Ridley, your typical white boy fantasy hero except worse, Snails, your typical black fantasy sidekick except <i>worse</i> (this character was handled in a pretty racist way), your typical fantasy female love interest whose name I can&#39;t remember (but she was an idiot), and a bunch of other people who were super unremarkable so I don&#39;t even remember them. I think Halle Berry might have been there? Don&#39;t quote me on that, though.<br><br>I could go on at length about what makes this movie bad in all the most hilarious ways, but I&#39;ll just link you to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ivkihk7cSIs">Nostalgia Critic review of it</a>. I think he hits most of the main points. The only one I think he doesn&#39;t hit is that Ridley and the love interest do the do inside a map. Yup, you read that right. They go inside a map, and then they do the do, and then it&#39;s never spoken of again. The whole thing is pretty funny. I&#39;d highly recommend it.<br><br>The second movie is kind of boring, honestly. It was made for TV and managed to be good enough that I found myself feeling the most apathetic stirrings of an emotion that just might have been interest in seeing the heroes succeed. The special effects are pretty terrible, though. If you&#39;re looking for <i>hilariously</i> bad this might not be the one for you because if nothing else you can tell they were trying. Its biggest failing is that they kept on trying to link it back to the first one.<br><br>So the third film completely ignored the existence of the first two. Good move, right? Jury&#39;s still out. See, the third film was <i>by far</i> the worst of the three. It starts with an opening narration that goes on for long enough that you start to wonder if the whole movie is going to be like this and it isn&#39;t some kind of poorly illustrated audiobook. It isn&#39;t, (un)fortunately. Eventually it ends and the characters show up on the screen. What then follows is roughly an hour and fifteen minutes of <i>absolutely nothing being explained ever</i>. It&#39;s trying to deal with issues of grey morality but instead of doing that it just kind of never addresses morality at all until something depends on someone&#39;s morality, and then it aligns them either good or evil as needed to move the shambling wight that passes for a plot along. Phrases like &quot;purest knight&quot; are thrown about liberally, and the writing is so lazy that the macguffin actually <i>morphs into a different object</i> about two thirds of the way through.<br><br>And then the rest of it is torture porn.<br><br>It&#39;s not horribly graphic torture or anything. It&#39;s like weird agony ray stuff. Personally I&#39;m less uncomfortable with the torture itself than I am with the... ah... evident <i>interest</i> in the torture that the movie has. If you <i>do</i> want to skip that part it should be easy. You&#39;ll know where it starts. Just stop watching the movie at that point because I wasn&#39;t even joking when I said the <i>rest</i> of it is torture porn. There is literally less than two minutes of movie left after the torture stops.<br><br>But for all that it&#39;s a glorious train wreck if you like pain. My biggest impression is that it&#39;s like they stuck the end and beginning of one movie onto the middle of a different one with Elmer&#39;s glue and then released it before it had finished drying.</p>

            <p>I had a junior high unit study of <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> that tried to refer to Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli as &quot;The Threee Hunters&quot;. For some reason it stuck with me all this time.<br><br>My copy of <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> also misspells the name of some elf or other at one point, but I don&#39;t remember where or who, unfortunately. I missed it on my last rereading.</p>

            <p>A deliberate nickname is one thing - I don&#39;t think we have a mini-Balrog named Leggy, for instance. But getting the name wrong because you misheard or misread it is a classic way to create a mini. Heck, my own Thanduril came into being because I wrote his name from memory and got it wrong.<br><br>hS</p>
