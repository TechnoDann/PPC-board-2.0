            <p>(Disclaimer: This is not something that is implemented currently, nor do I think that this idea is fully fleshed out, but it is something that genuinely interests me and I think it might be interesting to you all, too.)<br><br>This is an idea that I&#39;ve been throwing around, a little bit in the discord, and a little bit in my own head: What if there was a way people could just gift each other books in the PPC?<br><br>This is going to be a bit of a long post. So, bear with me, and please please please if you find anything wrong with this at all, or if you find any way the idea could be improved upon I would love to hear it! <br><br>The base idea is this, in a couple steps:<br>To have a database (perhaps a googledoc?) where people can share books that they own/want to donate, complete with titles, who&#39;d be willing to donate it, and a review. (I&#39;d personally like each book to have a review, and maybe even a tagging system, like &quot;Sci-Fi&quot; or &quot;Fantasy&quot;. That&#39;d be really cool, imo.)<br><br>So, after the database is there, the people who want books can just send whoever has the book a message, or somehow communicate with them that they&#39;d like the book. Or maybe someone has a book that they really would like to give to someone else! (I have a lot of books which I know certain people would love!)<br><br>And once those two people have communicated enough, this is where I&#39;d like to voice and possibly answer a concern. &quot;Are people comfortable with sharing where they live/where their general location is?&quot; And my answer, is that it really depends - some people are open, others aren&#39;t - I personally use drop locations, which aren&#39;t where I live, but around the general area where I can pick up packages and stuff. For the system to work and hopefully make people more comfortable, those who are interested in sharing books would talk to an established third party within the community. This third party would be the middleman - They would know and not share the information of where people receive books, and would also know where people are sending books from. They would be the only ones who know this information, aside from the sender and receiver, respectively. The sender would send the book to the third party, who would check and see that &quot;yes, this is really the book, and nothing else (unless specified)&quot; and the third party would send it off to the person who wanted the book.<br><br>That&#39;s probably a really long and convoluted way of explaining what I&#39;d like to have, if this idea ever came to be. A database, a third party, and people willing to give general/specific locations of where they send and receive stuff to the third party.<br><br>A couple issues which I&#39;ve already thought of, and can&#39;t really come up with good answers to.<br><br>1. Shipping.<br>That stuff is expensive. Who would be paying to send the books? How would that work out? Maybe determine between the two people?<br>2. Reliability of the third party.<br>How do we know that the third party isn&#39;t just going to take our books and just vanish disappear? We&#39;d have to establish a person or two who are comfortable with doing this, and who are trusted members of the community. <br>3. What about people who&#39;ve been offered books, want to receive them, but are unwilling to give a receiving location?<br>There&#39;s a lot of conditional and subjective stuff.<br><br>That&#39;s really all I&#39;ve thought of for now, but if you have any questions, thoughts, or concerns, please let me know!</p>

            <p>Unfortunately, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a feasible one. First because of all the practical concerns, and second because I&#39;m with doctorlit: any book of mine with particular sentimental value attached to it is one that I want to keep. Sending off ones I don&#39;t care about that much is not quite what you had in mind, I think. {= )<br><br><s>Plus I don&#39;t write in my books, that&#39;s sacrilege.</s><br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>When we&#39;re talking overseas shipping - and remember we have members from at least six different countries here - you could be looking at twice the price of the book in some cases.<br><br>A few years back, we did a PPC postcard exchange, where people passed their addresses to a single person who dealt them out at random. It worked okay... once. No-one was really interested in doing it a second time.<br><br>Unfortunately, it seems that most of your post is just an attempt to work out the kinks in the shipping side - and I don&#39;t think they&#39;re resolvable.

            <p>It&#39;s about giving, y&#39;know? You get to keep the books. Maybe they&#39;re annotated by the giver. There&#39;s probably easier ways to do this. But it&#39;s an idea, is all. Might not be a good one - open for discussion.</p>

            <p>-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----<br>Hash: SHA512<br><br>I like this idea.<br><br>You&#39;ve mentioned three concerns: high costs of postage, the risk of a borrower absconding with the borrowed books, and the privacy issues that arise with giving out a mailing address to a stranger on the Internet. <br><br>So, I have an idea, and while this doesn&#39;t address how satisfying it is to actually get a parcel in the mail or hold an actual printed book in your hands, it does address the problems you&#39;ve already realized: what if we started trading things like public domain E-books? There are many over at Project Gutenberg, especially old classics that weren&#39;t copyrighted or that have had their copyright expire. The hard part is finding something that appeals to you out of all those titles and that&#39;s where having a large group with similar interests could come in handy in helping to sort through the massive amount of books to find what you&#39;re looking for. <br><br>You&#39;ve also mentioned that there could be the potential for an emotional or a personal aspect to this, such as reading the annotations or the remarks left by the previous readers, which is also something that could be done electronically. After all, it&#39;s one thing to get a copy of an E-book, but it&#39;s another to get an E-book that a friend liked and recommended to you specifically based on what you like or don&#39;t. <br><br>-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----<br><br>iLUEARMKAB0WIQTfllUBtaeNnRzzfmVK3+74uImA+wUCWlga1QAKCRBK3+74uImA<br>+1knAgCEHNnMNQTXma4JN0hbBRsu7Tc8m2h8XiubWD1kCtbWSLt58CLA+4eBRWf3<br>osv+p+yaXxvbOx0AGR7v/ybtwMI4Af4sTX82HLc3/8+2M4wn5n2VVmNVY6D71aG1<br>qkyJqCNLfhOW41lbw1vTR82wxEah5X+z9m8Rx2QI06lHP3MaCcsb<br>=v0hU<br>-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----<br></p>

            <p>&quot;What do you <i>mean</i> you don&#39;t have any other clothes?&quot;<br><br>Cass sighed and flopped onto the bed like a sack of studiously indifferent potatoes. &quot;I don&#39;t need any other clothes, Em. That&#39;s what the Disguise Generator&#39;s for.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Oh. My. <i>God</i>. You have <i>not</i> been wearing the same outfit for the past three months.&quot; Em clambered out of the armchair and folded her arms, her foot tapping indignantly on the floor. &quot;Like, have you even been doing laundry?&quot;<br><br>&quot;... Spells count, right?&quot;<br><br>&quot;You are unbelievable.&quot;<br><br>&quot;You&#39;re a weregerbil.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Don&#39;t change the subject.&quot; Em twitched her nose. &quot;We are taking you clothes shopping and don&#39;t even <i>try</i> to get out of it.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Look, Emma, if you want to go clothes shopping, I won&#39;t stop you. Go. Take my purse if you want to, I know you blew threw your money for this month already. I just don&#39;t care about how I look. It doesn&#39;t matter to me.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Huh.&quot; Emma stopped tapping her foot, deep in thought. &quot;Damn. You hate it that much?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Hate implies I care about it.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Huh.&quot;<br><br>The clock in the corner of the room ticked. Every one seemed louder than the last. The RC beeped the beep of the righteous. The bathroom mirror prophesied their inevitable doom, which told them it was a Tuesday.<br><br>&quot;Can I ask a question, Cass?&quot;<br><br>&quot;You may.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Pedant. Anyway, were you serious about me taking your purse shopping on El Worldo Uno? I know how you are with money.&quot;<br><br>&quot;If it got me out of a shopping trip I would let you have my friggin&#39; <i>kidney</i>.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Wow. Uh. Okay. I mean, uh, I knew you didn&#39;t like it? But... yeah.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I&#39;m technically an adult, and adults get to decide what that means. In my case? Wear one set of clothing until it&#39;s basically a bunch of loosely connected holes, then buy the exact same outfit. Clothes shopping is an experience akin to having both my legs broken with a hammer and I never want to do it again.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Fine! Jeez. Like, you made your point.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Hey, I wouldn&#39;t make you go to LeakyCon-&quot;<br><br>&quot;Ugh. Gurl, for real, can you <i>not</i> with that name? I know what the history is, but it just sounds like a bunch of old folks packed into a convention centre talking about adult diapers.&quot;<br><br>&quot;My point exactly.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Dude, I said you already made your damn point. I get it, okay?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yeah. I... yeah. Sorry.&quot;<br><br>&quot;It&#39;s okay, Cass.&quot; Em sat down beside her and ruffled her hair. &quot;You&#39;re okay. You don&#39;t have to do anything you don&#39;t want to ever again, okay?&quot;<br><br>The clocks kept ticking. Louder and louder.

            <p>I can so much relate to &quot;clothes shopping – bah&quot;, although I understand the advantages of possessing more than one set of clothes. <br><br><i>The clock in the corner of the room</i> ticking off the seconds while Emma thinks about what to say next is a nice image (promptly turning into the absurdity that is PPC HQ), but there may be a small inconsistency when <i>The clocks kept ticking</i>.

            <p>Oh, my, this was fun to read, because Cass&#39;s attitude towards clothing and looks is basically mine.  I do have more than one set of clothes, but I only go clothes shopping if I get too low on shorts to make it through a week.  I do the laundry too, but I would most happily substitute a magic spell for using electricity and hot water.  Clothes are just extra matter that I would rather not have sitting around.  So I can absolutely get behind Cass&#39;s attitude here.<br><br>The dialogue is simple, but very expressive.  I can really feel the trust and camaraderie these agents have built up with each other, despite not seeing them on-page before.  I love Cass&#39;s plain honesty about her feelings, and Emma&#39;s energetic reactions to what Cass says.  And the last line of dialogue really opens up a mystery as to what was actually happening before the scene started to trigger this topic of discussion.<br><br>Looking back through Emma&#39;s dialogue after the reveal that she&#39;s a <i>Kim Possible</i> character, her speech definitely has that &quot;confident teen&quot; vibe that the young characters on the show tended to express, so good job getting that feeling across.  I have one question though.  KP didn&#39;t have any lycanthropes, so is Emma a true weregerbil, or one of DNAmy&#39;s experiments?<br><br>And one thing:<br>&quot;. . .

            <p>Yeah, initially Emma&#39;s weregerbilicity (which is a word, honest) was gonna be a joke about weird crossovers, but... well, DNAmy is a thing, and you can definitely get some mileage out of a person with gerbil traits having one of the most dangerous jobs in the multiverse.

            <p>There is an interesting mix of lines that make me remember that these people were writing from a very different cultural context and lines that directly mirror things people write today.

            <p>I&#39;ve got some poetry which I really really should get around to publishing in a magazine or something. Currently just sitting around, just existing, I guess.<br><br>But recently, I&#39;ve been working on a short story, which I suppose I&#39;ll turn into a novel, if it goes well enough. Gotta get those creative juices flowing, and start writing more of it though.<br><br>And lastly, I&#39;m tinkering with a nonlinear story. I tried to swap between the present and memories, but after having it reviewed by a couple beta&#39;s, it isn&#39;t prominent enough, and I ended up confusing people, instead of bringing new understanding to the writing.<br><br>Write more, write often.

            <p>all in the planning stages for years at this point.<br><br>&quot;Because We Like You&quot;<br>The chronologically next story of my spin-off, this takes place immediately after &quot;Pick Your Poison&quot; and shows my little Sue kid recruits being officially inducted to the PPC.  It&#39;s actually a fairly complex interlude, with a handful of cameos and, I think, the first really detailed description of the nursery we&#39;ve had yet?  If anyone knows of an existing one I may have missed, let me know.  But yeah, this one kicked my butt for literally years, and I&#39;m glad it&#39;s in the beta stage and close to release.  Just waiting for feedback from one more beta, Nesh! :)<br><br>* * *
<br><br>&quot;A Fistful of Hs&quot;<br>My Thirty Hs mission, now into its second draft.  I&#39;m trying to make this mission fairly unique and different, and not to turn it into &quot;oh no the badness is so bad,&quot; out of respect to the folks who find it legitimately entertaining.  I&#39;m trying to keep it pretty silly, but still have a plot surrounding it.  I had quite a lot of fun drafting it, actually.  There&#39;s also going to be a mini-mission side story of my Cafeteria agents going into Thirty Hs in search of edible substances.<br><br>This one will take a while to release, as there&#39;s another interlude I need to write for Doc and Vania that takes place between &quot;Because We Like You&quot; and this one, covering the 2013 Blackout.<br><br>An unbetad excerpt?<br>Vania nodded to Doc and started forward.  “Let’s do this.”<br><br>“Wait.  But.”  Doc glanced from his partner to the scientist.  “Disguises?”<br><br>“Do not bother,” said Minutia.  “None of this story actually takes place on the surface of the Wizarding World.”<br><br>“Okay, that was some very suspicious phrasing you just chose, there.”  Doc continued talking even as Vania dragged him towards the portal.  “Nobody said this was a crossover, and I don&#39;t see where a <i>Harry Potter</i> story could take place other than oh my God we’re in outer space.”<br><br>Indeed, they were.  The Potterverse version of Earth, geographically indistinguishable from World One’s, stretched out below the agents for a seemingly endless distance (with the British Isles facing them, appropriately enough).  The moon loomed huge ahead of them, and the sun, still too far away to look any bigger, was somewhere behind them, allowing the agents vision.<br><br>Doc began to scream for a split second, but then clamped his mouth shut with his cheeks puffed out.  He pressed his back to Vania and moved around her in a circle, flailing his arms.  As his cheeks began to darken, he sank down at Vania’s feet, grasping at her hand briefly until the hand fell and he went still.<br><br>“Doc, please stand up.  You&#39;re embarrassing me in front of all the celestial bodies.”<br><br>* * *
<br><br>&quot;The Garden Spells Trouble&quot;<br>This is going to be a weird interlude, even by PPC standards.  It appeared in my head fully formed after I read <i>Garden Spells</i> by Sarah Addison Allen, an obscure little romance with a very light dash of urban fantasy.  It&#39;s somewhere in between an interlude and a mission, and will finally reveal the Cafeteria Division&#39;s head after all these years.  And will also connect to Phobos&#39;s Catastrophe Series, somehow.  I doubt anyone was clamoring for Yoof and Séverine to get their own big episode, but uh.  It&#39;s coming.<br><br>This story is actually ready for a third draft before betaing, but I&#39;ve been putting it off since it takes place so far in the future from my current writing.  I wanted to bang the whole thing out right after reading GS, so I didn&#39;t lose the idea.<br><br>Another unbetad excerpt:<br>Meanwhile, Yoof had been checking out what food was available.  Uneaten food that required reheating had been carted back into the kitchens by the previous shift.  (Nonperishable food was left out in the Cafeteria to keep agents occupied while new food was prepared.  Less popular foods of this variety tended to sit out for weeks before either getting eaten by a desperate agent or managing to escape on its own.)  The kitchens also featured massive walk-in pantries, refrigerators and freezers, containing various raw ingredients and unprepared food acquired from various fics and canons.<br><br>&quot;What are our options today, Yoof?  Sound off leftovers.&quot;<br><br>Yoof stood rigid and saluted.  &quot;From the leftovers!  Slowpoke tail!  Frosted guano!  Meatloaf!&quot;<br><br>Séverine rolled her eyes.  Even all this time after the Blackout, the meatloaf was hardly getting touched.  Didn&#39;t agents understand that not eating the meatloaf was what had caused Slorp in the first place?  &quot;And what other ingredients can we use?&quot;<br><br>&quot;From the freezer!  Belgian fries!  Sea salt ice cream!  Maui&#39;s dolphin steak!  Ants!  Meatloaf!<br><br>&quot;From the fridge!  Spinning leek!  Rukh eggs!  Ham and jam and spam!&quot;<br><br>&quot;A lot?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yes!  Also, Superfast Jellyfish!  A few good taters!  Armored goat milk!  Meatloaf!<br><br>&quot;From the pantry!  Dehydrated dextro-amino foods!  Kupo Nuts and Deku Nuts!  Beebles!  Monkey biscuits!  Some DHARMA supplies!  Meatloaf!&quot;<br><br>&quot;<i>Excellént</i>, <i>excellént</i>.&quot;  Séverine rubbed her hands together, mentally combining ingredients.  She moved each of the mixing bowls to a separate counter.  &quot;We will put the guano and meatloaf back in the fridge.  We need the food to be eaten this time.&quot;  She paused again, glancing between the doors.  &quot;Okay.  Yoof, I am going to begin mixing Kupo Nuts into dough.  Please go knock some Beebles unconscious.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yes!&quot;  Yoof grabbed a large metal mallet from a corner and dragged it into the pantry, which was filled with tittering laughter.  Unnervingly, the sound only increased with each loud thwack, but Séverine was too focused on mixing to notice.<br><br>—doctorlit, the slowest writer</p>

            <p>Which are, uh, partially why I took so long to respond to this. <br>Also, procrastination. <br><br>By &#39;a few thing&#39;, what I actually mean is is that I have two main projects:<br><br>1. My first actual PPC story spinoff! Finally, after two years or so of being here, I&#39;ve nearly got the spinoff, er, begun. Not to imply all that time was spent on that spinoff, because that would then imply that the thing has had more effort put into it than it has, therefore implying that it&#39;s better than it probably will be! That was mostly just finishing school, and, and trying to figure out what I was even doing and, uh, procrastinating. <br>It will consist of a bunch of short stories all connected to a larger one. It will have no missions or sues and it will be about an Operations division that&#39;s had basically nothing written about it. <br><br>Dos. A weekly prompts thingy with Alleb. <br>I would actually really recommend this, if you lot have troubles with motivating yourself to write things - it was for this reason that Alleb and I started doing it, after all! It&#39;s also useful for that whole worldbuilderitis thing, which was also partly why I started doing it. <br>It&#39;s essentially a workshopping thing - one of us will find a prompt, we each have a week to write a thing on that prompt, and at the end of the week, we look at each other&#39;s stories, and beta them. Repeat next week, with the other person finding the prompt. <br>Thus, you manage to: <br> - Get writing practice done (which is a bit important considering that the only way to get better at writing is to write things)<br> - Get a bit of betaing practice in<br> - Get your writing consistently critically looked at<br>And so on and so forth. <br>Also, you get to talk consistently to cool people about your stories. At least, I do. <br>I&#39;ve been using it as a way to help me to further expand and look at my own original universe - using the prompts to write little vignettes within it. Which, of course, is very good for further developing it, and the like. </p>

            <p>I&#39;ve been writing bits and pieces of a PPC mission (that I probably won&#39;t publish) of a fic that I&#39;m not sure is badfic-bad but otherwise has a Gary Stu, uncanon, contrivance issues, consistency issues, general stupidity, and writing that goes from being not so great to sounding pretentious. <br>Even though I might end up not publishing the mission, I&#39;m writing it as an exercise and as a way to vent out my dislike on the stupid and annoying parts of the fic. <br><br>Ozzielot</p>

            <p>Technically speaking, there&#39;s not that much to beta. I didn&#39;t spot a single SPaG error. That doesn&#39;t mean there are none, but still!<br><br>The only spots where I was actually confused were the bit about how long Reill&#39;s been a bard and a little bit of a pronoun problem.<br><br>The first: &quot;&#39;Ten years,&#39; he said, smiling. &#39;Five years, if you count the traveling as part of it.&#39;&quot;<br><br>So... he&#39;s been a bard for <i>less</i> time if you include the travel? I don&#39;t get it.<br><br>The second: &quot;And in that moment, Reill realized he loved him.&quot;<br><br>I <i>think</i> you&#39;re most likely saying Reill realizes he loves Hallow, but it could also be read as Reill realizing that Hallow loves him, given the previous line of description detailing how admiringly Hallow is looking at him. I think fixing it would involve turning the focus back to Reill.<br><br>The prose is maybe a bit stiff in places, a bit &quot;there was this and then there was that,&quot; but it relaxes as you go, and you also have some beautiful descriptions that light up the world. I love the detail you put into the various regions, the foods of the South, the goods that come through Harrow&#39;s dock, and all of that.<br><br>As for the actual content? I like it! It&#39;s a very sweet and happy sort of world that Hallow lives in, up until the jerks turn up. Part of what makes this work better than your usual A/B/O fic is that this is (I think?) an original universe, where these are just the rules everyone is used to. You&#39;re not trying to stick these bizarre templates on characters who don&#39;t otherwise have them. You are also careful to remember that while people may fall into broad categories like, to take a real world example, &quot;gay&quot; or &quot;straight,&quot; that doesn&#39;t mean everyone in the category thinks and acts the same. (Nor does everyone necessarily fit neatly into them in the first place, which may or may not be something you want to deal with; I&#39;m just covering my butt.) Shockingly, we&#39;re all individuals!<br><br>As someone who is only familiar enough with A/B/O to know how deeply weird it is and that it has nothing to do with how wolves actually behave, I could use a little more information on what those categories mean in this world? I sorta get the impression that alphas are big and strong, and omegas are soft and pretty, and betas... actually betas haven&#39;t really come up at all yet. But on the other hand, I also appreciate that it&#39;s not treated as a terribly big deal; it just is. Like it would be if that&#39;s how the world worked.<br><br>I like how you&#39;ve developed the relationship between Hallow and Reill so far. Objectively, it might&#39;ve come to the point a bit quickly (three days, I think?), but it feels very natural nonetheless. Being able to talk to a person for hours, and feeling immediately comfortable in their presence, like they&#39;re an extension of yourself... that&#39;s how I fell in love with Phobos. So of course I like that. {= )<br><br>To answer Reill&#39;s question about happiness, have the quote from <i>Moulin Rouge</i> that immediately leapt into my head:<br><br><i>The greatest thing you&#39;ll ever learn<br>Is just to love and be loved in return.</i><br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----<br>Hash: SHA512<br><br>I end up with that middle section lull pretty often, since I find that starting a story and finishing it are the easiest parts. It&#39;s everything inbetween that I find is the most difficult, or finding a way to connect the scenes that I&#39;ve got a clear idea how to write. It&#39;s the scenes that connect those scenes that I have the most difficult time writing, myself. <br><br>I&#39;ve got a fairly simple method that I find works for me when I hit the scenes that act as glue to hold the other scenes together. It&#39;s not very efficient, but I find it works when all else fails. I usually try to take off on different tangents with one guiding rule: they must get me to or get me closer to the next bullet-point in my outline. From there I just try to write as many of those as I possibly can in the shortest amount of time without regard for their quality and produce as many tangents as I possibly can. In a way it&#39;s almost like NaNoWriMo, except rather than going for word count, I&#39;m going for anything that will at least get me closer. In some cases I might just even write the tangents in point form. <br><br>After I do a enough of these, I find that one of them just works or clicks and I get that &#39;aha!&#39; moment that I&#39;ve been hoping to get. Or I can even put two or more together that I like. From there, once I have at least something visualized and a few words, it&#39;s a simple enough process to rewrite and rework that tangent into something that I won&#39;t immediately feel ashamed of.<br>-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----<br><br>iLUEARMKAB0WIQTfllUBtaeNnRzzfmVK3+74uImA+wUCWlq8qwAKCRBK3+74uImA<br>+wcUAf4rk22wtau983IdrEoGa3r8Vfle6E/+A8srEUA8veSfUbvkEvLFSxzWP4Qp<br>JrhnLQyfGPFG9kEbSmNjvI4JqV77AfwN2RVSovDQFPLhfEShv9+qfCUozPYPLdEe<br>9XJp12oM/oIaaj9qgFjFBxHz6bUZ9fW++EDpc9DVF7rCt/9PALkN<br>=RZvV<br>-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----<br></p>

            <p>-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----<br>Hash: SHA512<br><br>Hey Thoth,<br><br>I recall you&#39;ve seen my own sort of take-on-the-PPC-that-isn&#39;t-a-PPC-spinoff; I&#39;ve considered rewriting it to more closely resemble the PPC continuity since. Unfortunately, some of the elements conflict too much with what&#39;s established and existing to make it compatible with the PPC continuity, so Watanabe &amp; Smith has unfortunately been in limbo for the past little bit and I&#39;d like to discuss the direction I&#39;m going in with other people. I&#39;m currently leaning toward continuing on the road I&#39;m on, and just keeping the disclaimer that it&#39;s not endorsed in any fashion by the PPC. <br><br>I&#39;ve also been working on writing a couple essays and how-tos that I also intend to put on my website for different pieces of advice. One that I&#39;ve thought to add includes a more expansive take on what I&#39;m calling the &quot;micro-story&quot; method of describing a character or as an exercise to brainstorm when building a character. I&#39;ve mentioned it here before although it was on the tailing end of another discussion. It&#39;s a method of using small, short descriptions of what your character does or has done, rather than use adjectives. I find that adjectives are inherently subjective and open to a wide amount of interpretation depnding on who you describe your character to and in many cases can be extrapolated to fit almost any character at all, wheras what they do say much more about them. That&#39;s why I champion the &quot;micro-story&quot; method so much and why I like to share it with other people. After that, we&#39;ll see what else I have to offer. <br><br>Unrelatedly, I might add some musings on the (extremely sad) state of computer security at the consumer level and some tips to stay safe at a later date. <br><br>Even though things have been going much more slowly than I&#39;d like, I wanted to mention that they&#39;re still going. <br>-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----<br><br>iLUEARMKAB0WIQTfllUBtaeNnRzzfmVK3+74uImA+wUCWlo+JwAKCRBK3+74uImA<br>++XTAf9TirKH6Y0KqakgVK5xRV2kUkdsgbu4+7mcnhgMJemDqSWE7JjERqm/X8Z8<br>B0ds/cJ2k2/YZAKy6ERkWHf+l+3dAgCBXKkyvMtVYxhyzYh/+zuv36H3Rq8KBfYU<br>vOUOzg4UclD4mVkNtFFZrQi+3XRKMxpnrsVENIALBrjZaozYAHkn<br>=r7Ys<br>-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----<br></p>

When we start painting people green, give them tusks, and call them Orcs I sometimes wonder where the line is between a bit of harmless fantasy fun and making a caricature for &quot;savages&quot; or &quot;primitives&quot; much the same way I&#39;m guessing some of the early explorers may have felt during the scramble for Africa and the Americas. Sometimes the caricature isn&#39;t so bald-faced when laser guns, space ships, and aliens add a fresh coat of sci-fi paint overtop it but it&#39;s still there.

            <p>That was an interesting read.

            <p>Sad Puppies is essentially a voting campaign that tries to influence the outcome of the Hugo Awards. People involved basically nominate books that don&#39;t contain &quot;heavy handed messages&quot;, and believe the Hugo Awards focus too much on &quot;forced diversity&quot; and social issues. Basically they are the Gamergate and alt right of the literary world.

            <p>The mention of an essay on SF colonialism caught my eye. I personally think there is nothing morally reprehensible about establishing settlements on uninhabited worlds. In the unlikely event that a probe found a world which already supported life, greater caution would have to be taken, we can&#39;t have Terran viruses destroying a whole ecosystem.</p>

            <p>This came up in the chat, and seemed worth posting about here.<br><br>Most of the Legendary Badfic list is missioned or being missioned. A good portion of what&#39;s left seems to have fallen off the Internet (see, for example, Cho Chang&#39;s Desires, where almost all the Google hits lead to ... us).<br><br>Is this just because there&#39;s no more Legendary Badfic left out there, or that the criteria are a bit strict? Maybe.<br><br>However, a much more likely possibility is that we just haven&#39;t gone looking. The list hasn&#39;t been added to in years. (It probably doesn&#39;t help that fandom has moved from where it used to be years ago, and we as a community/broader movement within fandom didn&#39;t move with it all that much, IMO.)<br><br>So, what&#39;s Legendary these days? If anyone, especially some of the newer Boarders, has some insight, please do post, even if it doesn&#39;t quite meet the standards we set back in 2016.<br><br>- Tomash</p>

            <p>...but &quot;Latias&#39; Journey&quot; seems like a good candidate. It has at least three pages of hits on Google, it was published between 2004 and 2009, has its own TV Tropes article, and is pretty well known among dA and Reddit. I&#39;ve been told that at first it seems innocuous enough, but then there&#39;s this bit from the TV tropes summary: <br><br><i>It&#39;s absurdly long, surreal and bizarre to extremes, interspersed with plenty of lightheartedness, and plenty of fight sequences. And sometimes it&#39;s really, really dark, squicky, messy, and all kinds of disturbing.<br>Oh sorry, we should&#39;ve mentioned this is rated M. Pack your security blanket and Brain Bleach.</i><br><br>The whole Tropes article itself is here, and includes a link to the fic itself:<br><a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/LatiasJourney"><a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/LatiasJourney">http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/LatiasJourney</a></a><br><br>And then there&#39;s &quot;Sweet Apple Massacre&quot;, which I&#39;ve also mentioned before... It was published in 2011, has its own KnowYourMeme page, and again, turns up three pages or more of hits on Google. And I think it caused enough of a stir in the MLP fandom back in the day to qualify as well.<br><br>I&#39;m still not entirely sure if Latias&#39; Journey is eligible for adding to the list, since I think Legendary Badfics are outright BAD from the get-go and there do seem to be a few tidbits of genuinely good writing in the midst of all the grossness, but I believe Sweet Apple Massacre certainly is.</p>

            <p>One from Naruto:<br><br>Chunin Exam Day seems like a pretty good candidate. Published between 2007 and 2010 and still heavily referenced on various sites within the last year, it fits all the qualifications for a Legendary.<br><br>As for the fic itself: Naruto gets stuck in a Groundhog Day loop and quickly uses it to start winning over (romantically) all the ladies with massages and simple gifts. This includes adult women. He also uses it to make himself incredibly overpowered. All good characterization is tossed out the window immediately so Author tracts can begin, and the fic is just awful.<br><br>The Tropes page, with a link to the fic:<br><a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/ChuninExamDay"><a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/ChuninExamDay">http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/ChuninExamDay</a></a><br><br>The other three are from Harry Potter:<br><br>The first of the three is Partially Kissed Hero. Started in 2008 and finished in 2012, it is a little less mentioned in the last year. However, it has been very well known, and is by the same author as Chunin Exam Day.<br><br>The Fic starts with Harry getting partially kissed by a Dementor, which destroys the Horcrux inside him. However, the story rapidly goes off the rails, with multiple brutal deaths to characters like Dumbledore and Snape for no real reason. The attitudes towards women are the same in the previous fic, and Harry rapidly amasses a large Harem of basically every attractive female character. The plot also rapidly goes more insane, mostly due to Harry spiraling into darkness in a way that is entirely meant to be considered Protagonist-worthy.<br><br>The Tropes page is here, with a link to the fic.<br><a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/PartiallyKissedHero"><a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/PartiallyKissedHero">http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/PartiallyKissedHero</a></a><br><br>The third fic is the rather famous HHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH, or Thirty Hs. Still rather talked about in the same terms as My Immortal, this fic is still rather talked about with hundreds of hits for either version of the name. It was originally made in 2005, with a recent set of edits in 2015. Like the others, it has a Tropes page, and definitely qualifies for Legendary as far as I can tell.<br><br>To quote the Trope page:<br>It&#39;s a Harry Potter fanfic, just like My Immortal. It&#39;s So Bad, It&#39;s Good, just like My Immortal, it has extreme Canon Defilement, just like My Immortal. However, the two are different in one key detail: whereas My Immortal was (ostensibly) written by a Wangsty 13 year old girl, this was (ostensibly) written by an Ax-Crazy 13 year old boy.<br><br>The Tropes page itself, with the fic link:<br><a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/ThirtyHs"><a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/ThirtyHs">http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/ThirtyHs</a></a><br><br>The final fic I&#39;m nominating is Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality. This one is the one that fits the least of the requirements. First published in 2010, and completed in 2015, the fic has quite a cult following and a TV Tropes article. The fic itself is quite divisive, with a very &#39;love it or hate it&#39; attitude among readers.<br><br>The fic itself starts with a simple premise: Petunia married a scientist. Now Rationalist!Harry enters the wizarding world armed with Enlightenment ideals and the experimental spirit. Very quickly, Harry becomes a massive Sue, with both his and the rest of the cast being warped to fit into the author&#39;s philosophy, which is stated repeatedly in the fic in massive author tracts. Enormous chunks of canon are altered or ignored to make the story fit, to the point of making Lily try to murder Voldemort with the Killing Curse or having Voldemort make hundreds of Horcruxes because he&#39;s clever. I&#39;m gonna stop there because there is a lot wrong with this fic.<br><br>Tropes page is here, with the link:<br><a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/HarryPotterAndTheMethodsOfRationality"><a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/HarryPotterAndTheMethodsOfRationality">http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/HarryPotterAndTheMethodsOfRationality</a></a></p>

            <p>I think the most important bit is that lots of people have to be talking about it across the fanbase.

They had to infiltrate Twistey&#39;s forbodding  dungeons but in order to do so, they had to wear a disguise.  <br><br>Shadow thought long and hard about the best disguise. They couldn&#39;t be too obvious or threatening because then Twistey&#39;s guards could catch them. But they couldn&#39;t look too mundane because then Twistey&#39;s guards would never let them in.<br>No... they had to be clever.<br><br>So Shadow came up with the best idea she had: they would dress up in gothic clothes!&quot;<br><br>&quot;And she also had a corset made from unicorns gut that looked so awesome on her.&quot; (What? O.O)<br><br>-Twistey/Twizzlin the CHEESESCRAPER!</p>

            <p>I was wondering how the generator would attempt to customize the story to different characters, before I realized that it didn&#39;t have to - because it is emulating something where people tend to act out-of-character, it doesn&#39;t care if each &#39;hero&#39; is the same apart from their names.</p>

            <p>(Oh darn, apparently I hit the Create Post button by accident. Oh well.)</p>

<p>Whitney cleared her throat, unsure of where to begin. She hadn't seen this many people in RC #88224646BABA before, and she certainly hadn't had any experience with hosting a crowd event, let alone the New Years' Gift Exchange like she'd attended like what, two years ago? Still, it was worth a try.</p>

<p>"Alright everyone," she said. "Welcome, come one, come all, to the annual PPC New Year's Gift Exchange! I know it's been a while since New Year's Day, but I guess all's well that ends well, as the saying goes. Apparently, I'm going to be your host for this year, and I'll try my best to be a good moderator. So, shall we begin?"</p>

<p>There were murmurs of assent all around. Whitney cleared her throat, getting everyone's attention.</p>

<p>"Before you is a collection of Party Balls from the Super Smash Bros. series, all of which have been enchanted with, in the parlance of a certain famous literature series, an Undetectable Expansion Charm. You will not be able to guess what each contains, but once you pick one, you'll have to stick with what's inside. Unless you want to steal a gift, of course - but remember that a gift can be stolen up to twice, and you can't steal back a gift once someone else has taken it."</p>

<p>She smiled warmly before continuing. "Each of you will have received a ticket with a randomly selected number, so you will go in numerical order. We will go around from 1 to 18 until everyone has received a gift. So with that, let the gifting commence!"</p>

<p>(The rules of the game can be seen <a href="http://disc.yourwebapps.com/discussion.cgi?disc=199610;article=313227;title=PPC%20Posting%20Board">here</a>, and the spreadsheet for the participants and gifts can be viewed <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1H_2Axwof2qK7gfn5bcgAs6mYosBh9TvC51HVFDoEGX0/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>.

<p>She trotted up to the stage. "Let's see here...gah, it's so much harder to choose when they all look the same." Her horn lit up and a party ball at the back of the pile levitated towards her.</p>

<p>"If she gets my present I'm gonna laugh," said Miguel.</p>

<p>The Party Ball opened, and a jam jar full of a strange gel landed on the stage. "Well, this is...interesting..."</p>

            <p>"That is some premium-grade Monstrous Nightmare gel, locally sourced from my boy Fellrazer here." She patted the blue, dog-sized dragon at her side, who parted his jaws in a toothy grin. "Coat something with that, and it'll burn. Hot." She turned from Ami to the other agents. "And there's more where that came from! If you're interested, come to Response Center 1110 with a reasonable offer, and we'll talk. No Zorkmids, though. Fellrazer Brand Monstrous Nightmare Gel: Get It While It's Hot!"</p>

<p>Her partner gave a long-suffering sigh. "Gall. Are you going to choose a gift <i>today</i>?" He gestured at the remaining Party Balls.</p>

<p>"Oh, right." The Viking went up to the pile, stared at it a moment with her lips pursed, then stuck her hand in and snagged one. She offered it to Fellrazer to sniff. He nudged it with his snout, licked it, tilted his head, and attempted to eat it.</p>

<p>Gall yanked it back. "Okay, good enough for me!" She shoved the dragon's snout down with one hand and opened the ball with the other. Out popped the distinctive form of a lightsaber handle. Gall's face lit with glee, and she eagerly scooped it up. "Is this what I think it is?" She toggled the control—and immediately flinched away from the bright urple beam. "Aw, no! Why would you <i>do</i> that?!" She held it as far away from herself as she could.</p>

<p>Fellrazer, too, hissed and backed away from the urple 'saber.</p>

<p>Derik laughed, although he was careful not to turn his good eye in Gall's direction. </p>

(( For the record, I rolled a d20 to make it a random selection. More fun that way.</p>

<p>(( A little more info on Monstrous Nightmare gel: it is bright lime green, and similar in action to kerosene gel or napalm. ))</p>

            <p>Almost instantly, Backslash blushed and covered his face with his scarf. "Whitney, we're in public! Ugh, alright then. Let's get this over with."</p>

<p>He stepped over to the collection of Party Balls, picked one up, and punched it hard. Instead of flying across the room, the large orb gently floated into the air, and started flashing red with its distinctive jingle.</p>

<p>Next moment, the ball split in half, and something glitchy-looking flew out of it, landing on top of his head. It seemed to shift between a bunch of pixels, several skeletal fossil Pokemon, and a black ghost-like shape, unsure of what to make of itself.</p>

<p>"Just my luck," he muttered. "I get the glitch Pokemon right out of the gate."</p>

He got up to choose his present, and then something sank in. "Wait, Whitney, did you call him 'Mr. Fitzgerald-to-be'? I didn't even know you guys were dating!"</p>

<p>"Congratulations to both of you!" said Ami, smiling fondly. </p>

<p>Chris took a deep breath and grabbed a random Party Ball. "Please don't be awful, please don't be awful, please don't be--"</p>

<p>The ball split in half, and a pair of gauntlets with curved blades and shotgun barrels landed in front of him.</p>

<p>"Aw, man, how come you guys always get all the cool toys?" said Violet.</p>

Maxewell, Granz, Hardric, World-Jumper, and Delta Juliette are all so close together that it&#39;s pointless to try and distinguish them. To be honest, if Quincy and Matt weren&#39;t so rural, they would be part of it as well.<br><br>RemnantShadow, meanwhile, has joined the colonisation of the Eastern Desert - there&#39;s five people in there, too! In fact, everyone east of Maxewell, except for Quincy and Hardric, is in a desert or worse (and the only deserts west of Maxewell are Larfen and Tomash). Given the five different forests and marshes floating around in the west, I think we can conclusively say that the ecology/production bar follows the communist/capitalist one...!<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>The PolitiScales site asks 117 questions, in order to plot your political opinions on 8 scales: Constructivist-Essentialist, Communist-Capitalist, Rehabilitative-Punitive Justice, Regulationism-Laissez-faire, Progressive-Conservative, Ecology-Production, Internationalist-Nationalist, and Revolution-Reform. It also provides you a flag and a &#39;motto&#39; (generated from your results); those sets of three words most people have posted are the &#39;mottos&#39;. Finally, it can give you extra stickers for things that don&#39;t quite show up on the bars - so Kaitlyn got Radical Feminist, Horvat got Monarchist, and most people who aren&#39;t me got Pragmatist.<br><br>This isn&#39;t the first time we&#39;ve played at political profiling; we&#39;ve actually done it three times before, 2014-16. But that was done just on two axes: Left/Right and Authoritarian/&#39;Libertarian&#39;. I took to plotting everyone on a graph using their results, and drawing things like maps to turn the graph into a story.<br><br>For this year, with its 8 axes, I&#39;ve had to dramatically expand the scope of the map. I&#39;ve added height, alignment, land type... well, lots of stuff, as I said. And I&#39;ve been adding people as they come in.<br><br>I think you&#39;re still Imgur-deficient? In that case, <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vTGecOb9TP0k3sovrE3MmQlgbTVO8o0BcS16Vf609orl1oLIZymHAZy_u7NkmmQxJzk7VRm77rDFhZp/pub">here</a> are the three maps: 2015, 2016, and the current 2018 one. The &#39;story&#39; (such as it is) has Plortitics progressing from a medieval world (2015) to a steampunk Age of Brass (2016), to the current magical world. The Eastern Mountains are the traditional home of various evil overlords (because the first people plotted out there were Dark Brother 16 and EvilAIUberOverlord, so, y&#39;know...), hence War-Queen Alleb.<br><br>If you would like to guesstimate your position on the 8 axes (as a percentage: so, for instance, &#39;67% Communist&#39;), I can add Twistey as a rumoured hidden city after the weekend; I can even generate what your flag would be if you could fill it out. But no obligation. :) (Oh, for the flag part, please also say whether you strongly support any of the following: anarchists, radical feminists [ie, the abolition of gender, according to the site], or monarchists [ie, every country should have a monarchy]. The other &#39;stickers&#39; don&#39;t count for flags.)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve... uh, just spent a couple of hours reverse-engineering how the flags are created. :-/ As y&#39;do.<br><br>As expected, the flag is created deterministically from your stats. It can have up to three colours and one symbol. In the list below, the symbols are ranked from 0to 7 [rather than 1-8, because I found the double-X symbol right at the end and didn&#39;t feel like renumbering); the active symbol with the rank closest to 0 will be shown regardless of their respective stats. The colours, on the other hand, are picked based on the stats and the priority list. The actual layout of the flag is determined by the number of colours (2 or 3 - 1 is just a plain field, obviously) and the values of &#39;Internationalism&#39; and the Reform/Revolution bar.<br><br>It&#39;s not possible to make any flag you want: you can&#39;t have a fleur-de-lys without white on there, for instance, or a shield without blue. But with this, you can manipulate the URL to your heart&#39;s desire to get any <i>possible</i> design.<br><br><hr>

Though not affiliated with Chaos, she has a fervent (one might almost say fanatical) hatred for magic, and harvests the anti-Mana thrown from the active volcano above her base.<br><br>Meanwhile, in the west, an ancient magical spell has finally been broken by the mages of Huinesoron, revealing an entire mountain that had previously been invisible. Upon its heights sits the great city of Tomash, blending science and magic together to further the cause of Chaos.<br><br>All in all, things don&#39;t look terribly good for the magic-lovers among the forces of Order.

            <p>(First off: <a href="http://politiscales.la-commune.net/en_US/results/?s0=45&amp;s1=24&amp;b1=14&amp;b0=48&amp;t0=10&amp;t1=48&amp;p0=17&amp;p1=24&amp;e0=19&amp;e1=29&amp;c1=29&amp;c0=45&amp;femi=43&amp;m0=21&amp;m1=17&amp;j1=29&amp;j0=26&amp;prag=67">this</a> is the link to Matt&#39;s full results, for you nebby types.)<br><br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/Q4QxEAh.png"><br><br>To the Office of Thaumaturgy, Huinesoron,<br><br>After a long and arduous trip, we have finally come to a conclusion: the Office of Cartography are terrible at their job. They managed to miss <i>multiple</i> major cities - including Granz, which lies directly between Neshomeh and Hardric! - as well as an entire desert, and the delta around the town of doctorlit. We attach a vastly more complete map of Plortitics, compiled from our own efforts. We have also included a key, since apparently they didn&#39;t feel that was worth their time.<br><br>Now, moving onto something more interesting: we were able to confirm the presence of vast magical fields on both our own mountain and the mountains of Chaos. The triple city of Scapegrace, palindromordnilap, and Kaitlyn is practically buzzing with mana, more&#39;s the pity. We also confirmed weaker magical activity in the desert of Larfen and the forest of Neshomeh, as well as uncovering a previously-unknown magical wellspring in the eastern deserts, around Phobos.<br><br>Unfortunately, with good news comes the bad: we have also confirmed the existence of anti-Mana. This magic-absorbing force appears to have sprung from the actions of the ancient Uber Overlord: its strongest source is around the mountain on which his fortress once stood, while a weaker scattering can be found in the desert where he made his final stand.<br><br>It is to be hoped that the forces of Chaos do not gain possession of anti-Mana, for they could be a powerful weapon against us. Conversely, if the town of Matt Cipher could be convinced to collect up the material, we could begin to nullify Chaos&#39; arcane advantages...<br><br>One final note: while travelling the emptiness of the north coast, we sighted a fleet out to see. The warriors of Guardsman Tom are still prowling around out there, and they owe allegiance to Chaos...<br><br>-The First Huinesoronic Thaumaturgical Expedition<br><br>~<br><br>Comments from the fully tricked-out map:<br><br>-Belief in change through revolution is common (though not guaranteed) in the far Left. The &#39;far&#39; Right, though, aren&#39;t generally firm believers in reform - that belief is held by the centre. I think this means that the status quo is Right-leaning, and that the closer you are to that, the less you think massive change is needed.<br><br>-Progressives (further south) are more likely to be constructivists, while conservatives are more likely to be essentialists. It&#39;s not a hard rule, but there&#39;s definitely more little brown houses as you go north.<br><br>-Most of the stats, helpfully, aren&#39;t strongly correlated with anything. Belief in rehabilitation versus punishment (city size), for instance, doesn&#39;t seem to be linked to any of the other seven. Which says that they chose their axes well.<br><br>-I need to launch an investigation into what determines your flag and motto. :D This is fun!<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>A bit disappointed at that, to be perfectly honest, but  I suppose the great brass snowflake couldn&#39;t remain afloat forever. Perhaps we scuttled it upon the shore and carried its remnants inland to build our new home, and its salvaged mechanisms and sorceries are what send forth the chaotic mana that is our new lifeblood.</p>

            <p>From the Help page:<br><blockquote>Why are the people how they are? This axis allows you to situate yourself between two opposite poles which answer this question.<br><br>The <b>constructivists</b> consider that people build themselves from their environment (notably social) and that the caracteristics that make them who they are, are acquired.<br><br>On the contrary, the <b>essentialists</b> consider that an individual is by nature how he/she is and that his/her caracteristics which make this person who she/he is, are innate.</blockquote>A lot of the questions dealing with this axis were things like whether you believe people from different countries have inborn traits that make them different from other people, or that quote about whether one is born a woman or becomes a woman.<br><br>IMO, the answer to this, as with most things, is that it&#39;s both. Like, a population that breeds mostly with itself for long enough is gonna develop a few genetic traits that may set it apart from other populations, like e.g. a preponderance of a certain blood type; but on the other hand, we are so very social, and our societies matter immensely; but on the <i>other</i> hand, we have the intelligence to overcome our past experiences and adapt to new ones.<br><br>... Again, this is why I struggle with these tests. ^_^;<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

I&#39;m really not sure how that stuff is determined, or the colors and designs on the flags, either.<br><br>Anyway, I care! I just get tripped up when my mind starts conjuring scenarios like digging wells so people can have access to safe water and that sort of thing. Like, we shouldn&#39;t be demolishing the rain forest or the Alaskan wilderness etc., but I think people have a right to a certain quality of life as concerns access to vital resources, and if we properly care for the environment <s>and drastically reduce our population</s>, then everyone&#39;s quality of life will improve, so it&#39;s all much of a muchness?<br><br>This is why I have so much neutral space in my scores...<br><br>~Neshomeh really believes overpopulation is one of our most serious problems, but there are no quick <i>and</i> easy solutions to this.

            <p>It has a lot to do with the fact that the people there, orcs or humans, hated the heat of the sun. The cool mountain air does reduce the heat in the afternoon, but no one showers in the morning. The cold water&#39;s too oppressive before noon, and the hot showers is just a short respite.</p>

            <p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/wADBQJX.png"><br><br>Oh Most Illustrious Office of Cartography, good news! We have confirmed that the shape of the world is much as the First Expedition determined (though we submit for your consideration a slight adjustment to the position of the Centre Pole, to bring it closer to our own dear city). There are some <i>few</i> discrepancies, however, which bear consideration.<br><br>Firstly, the Chaotic forces of Scapegrace are not, in fact, led by Scapegrace. Quite understandably, the First Expedition failed to recognise that the metropolis of Scapegrace is twinned with a second, larger, mountaintop fastness known as palindromordnilap, which is even more devoted to the Chaotic cause. Worse, the mountain of palindromordnilap sits at the heart of an enchanted forest, making it even more magical than our own mountain.<br><br>Secondly, we understand fully that the terrain between Huinesoron and the southern sea is rough and difficult; it is therefore entirely reasonable that the First Expedition could have missed the vast desert that lies there. The ommission of the city of Larfen J. Stocke, esq. - the largest non-Chaotic city we know of, and our own major trading partner - can be chalked up to <s>general incompetence, by all the gods, what were those clowns doing?!</s> mere error.<br><br>For the glory of Huinesoron!<br><br>-The Second Huinesoronic Mapping Expedition<br><br>;)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>We did this back in 2016, and 2015... and 2014! It&#39;s heaps of fun, I make maps of everything by plotting the two axes as... the... wait.<br><br>Hmm.<br><br>This is going to take some thought.<br><br>Okay, first of all, my results: <a href="http://politiscales.la-commune.net/en_US/results/?p1=10&amp;p0=52&amp;b0=83&amp;m0=81&amp;t1=60&amp;t0=10&amp;e1=29&amp;e0=40&amp;j1=21&amp;j0=48&amp;s0=76&amp;s1=5&amp;c0=52&amp;femi=38&amp;c1=10">Humanity, Equality, Socialism</a>. Shockingly, I am not as extreme as Scapegrace. ^_^<br><br>Right, now for the fun part. In 2015, <a href="https://imgur.com/iui8NwV">the PPC inhabited an idyllic medieval landscape</a>, except for the evil fortresses in the eastern mountains, the vast metropolis, the fractious nomads in the desert, the warlike woodsmen of the northern forest... okay, so scratch the &#39;idyll&#39; part.<br><br>In 2016, <a href="https://imgur.com/9K2HL5v">the Age of Brass dawned</a>. Cities roamed the landscape, some even taking to the seas. The Central City conquered the nomads, the nomads conquered the forest, a great fortress ground its way in from the east... it was a terrible time, though kind of awesome to watch.<br><br>The war between Central City and the brazen castle of the Uber Overlord was devastating. The landscape roiled around them, and when the fires died, the time of technology died with them. From the ruins emerged a new power: the coruscating glow of mana.<br><br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/2cdj9c7.png"><br><br><i>-Product of the First Huinesoronic Mapping Expedition</i><br><br>The cities of the great continent of Plortitics are mapped by not two, not even four, but <b>eight</b> different standards. Simplest, of course, are geographical location: north-south [Conservative-&gt;Progressive] and east-west [Capitalist-&gt;Communist]. Of the four cities mapped, three stand in the ruins of ancient settlements: Scapegrace, Huinesoron, and Hardric. The town of Quincy Jones has been founded since the war ended, in what was once the Great Desert.<br><br>Almost as simple is altitude [Nationalism-&gt;Internationalism]. The cities of Huinesoron and Scapegrace stand high on their bluffs, facing across the valley of the Fabled River.<br><br>When the expedition set out, they expected population [Punitive-&gt;Rehabilitative Justice] and urbanisation [Essentialist-&gt;Constructivist] to go hand in hand, but that turned out not to be entirely accurate. Certainly, the city of Scapegrace is both the most heavily urbanised, and the largest - but the other three towns hold equal populations, though Quincy Jones is almost entirely rural.<br><br>The environment [Production&gt;Ecology] in the four towns is almost identical, but there is one environmental factor that divides them: mana [Laissez-faire-&gt;Regulation]. The lowland towns at Hardric and Quincy Jones are almost devoid of it, while the mountain fastnesses of Huinesoron and Scapegrace practically sing with it.<br><br>So are the cities of Plortitics at peace? Hardly! The three towns stand in rough alliance at the Lawful end of the scale [Reform&gt;Revolution], but Scapegrace holds itself in opposition. Though open war is yet to be declared, the vale of the Fabled River is the site for numerous skirmishes...<br><br>... or so we think. It may be that this map is in error, and that more data will change completely the way we think of the world.<br><br>((All eight axes are shown on the map. Constructivism: level of city vs. houses. Socialism: how far west. Rehab justice: size of settlement. Regulation: number of Mana sparks. Progressivism: how far south. Ecology: base colour (currently all grass-green). Internationalism: height. Revolutionary: black walls for revolutionary. Values are calculated as (value of longest coloured bar + half value of &#39;undecided&#39; bar).))<br><br>All maps will be updates of this one. Go for it, people! :D<br><br>hS<br><br>PS: I love the flags, incidentally. And I love to imagine that the chief cause of conflict between Huinesoron and Scapegrace is &#39;what order should the three parts of the motto go in&#39;. :D :D</p>

            <p>That&#39;s actually a weirdly fluctuating thing here.  I didn&#39;t realize it was an issue for years, because it had always left me logged in for long stretches of time, but then one day, one of the oldbies was complaining about it, and I was shocked anyone had difficulty with that.  This past year, it started doing the same to me, never leaving me logged in.

            <p>I really enjoyed the tone of this.  Just calm and peaceful and simple, and really no PPC weirdness or supernatural whatever drawing focus from the characters.  I also like the shift from the beginning, when Ix is unsure and Charlotte is supportive, and the reversal after Charlotte gets sunburned, where she becomes panicky and needs to rely on Ix&#39;s experience to stop the hurt.  It&#39;s a creative way of getting to the proposal as well, without the usual set up for that kind of scene.<br><br>One error!<br><i>Ix’s palms were slick with sweat by the time they got past the Security Dandelion guarding the <b>exist</b>, and when the heat of World One’s sun hit them, it only got worse.</i><br>Dandelions may guard the exist, but remember that tires don exits.<br><br>—doctorlit heavily recommends &quot;kids&quot; sunscreen for anyone spending time in strong sunlight.  It&#39;s at least as effective as the adult stuff, but a bit less questionable-chemicals-y.</p>

            <p>I just read this interlude, and it made me very happy.<br><br>I have some things in common with Ix. I&#39;m a disabled person without much of a gender, and I wish I didn&#39;t have boobs and wear loose clothing. Dealing with all of this is a little bit awkward sometimes even though I don&#39;t have major dysphoria, especially since I know I&#39;ll never have the money to make any actual physical changes. (Other than cut my hair short. I currently have a buzz cut and it is soo comfy.)<br><br>It was really healing to see Charlotte and Ix being adorable together, and Charlotte having no problem with Ix&#39;s gender or lack thereof, and it generally being considered a completely normal thing to admit to not being quite the gender they thought you were when you were born.<br><br>I mean, I know it&#39;s the PPC and everything, where it&#39;s normal to see sentient shades of blue and talking horses and whatnot, and being genderqueer doesn&#39;t even register as odd there. But the fact is, out of character, the PPC stories are written by real people who really have those opinions and want the world to actually be that way.<br><br>So yeah, this makes me happy.</p>

<li>Ix giving up her bed for Lotte is probably going to come up later, isn&#39;t it?<br>- Shame about the knee, thank goodness Ix has magic<br>- Using a wand to summon the TV remote would be pretty awesome, I agree with Ix there<br>- Ok, yeah, that is going be an argument at some point<br>- Lotte massively falling down the ranks at Overwatch makes sense, and now I&#39;m wondering if she&#39;ll earn her way back up<br>- Poor Ix. (re: the indecision about New Cal)<br>- I can see why Ix&#39;d want to avoid making a scene, given her backstory<br>- &quot;how <i>different</i> she was&quot;. Ouch, kinda.<br>- Ok, yeah, general comment now that I&#39;m on the clothing-picking scene: I do hope Ix can somehow work through all this crap she&#39;s been through and the self-hatred and the like<br>- Ix does seem generally down around the bottom of page two<br>- But still, kisses and relationship fluff!<br>- Oh. Ix is going to come out as genderfluid.<br>- Lotte is doing a very good job of reacting to this. Then again, she already knew.<br>- Ok, so now Ix is going to do the &quot;I&#39;m worried you&#39;ll break up with me because werewolf&quot; angst thing<br>- ... Charlotte, if only you know who was writing you<br>- Charlotte getting sunburned was really funny for some reason. Probably the rapid mood shift.<br>- Awww, necklace thing<br>- Why doesn&#39;t Ix want [Lotte] to look down?<br>- Yeah. Right after morphing wasn&#39;t quite the right time, I think.<br>- Huh. They might be getting married at some point.<br>- It&#39;s nice that Lotte is being considerate of Ix<br><br>Overall: That was a nice interlude.

            <p>Hi everyone! After a pilot session a few months ago, some folks finally <s>put up with me long enough</s> got together to make two episodes of Citation Needed!

It&#39;s not exactly polished stuff - I&#39;ve got a pronounced stutter thanks to a brush with psychoactive medication and Internet connections aren&#39;t always the most stable things - but it&#39;s funny and insightful and teaches about interesting fun things. So, without further ado:<br><br><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1vkEh4O4Vfp6d-YBh2EimwKBvZdRBw6oi">Episode 1: Jacob Haugaard and Danish Pyramids</a><br><i>Featuring: Alleb, Larfen, and Tomash</i><br><br><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=17xHbAbzfK2MtJ96xTn1IKOO8MGIDDxvm">Episode 2: Banjawarn Station and Nuclear Sheep</a><br><i>Featuring: Granz, Larfen, and Tomash</i><br><br>Please feel free to leave comments about what you liked, what you didn&#39;t, and what sort of things you&#39;d like to see in future episodes.

            <p>My oldest sister saw this, and then poked Mom into watching it with her, since she wanted to see it again.  Then Mom poked me into watching it, because <i>she</i> wanted to see it again.  This paragraph has been a spoiler block.<br><br>I&#39;m going to be looking at this movie as a movie, and not as a representation of the historical events it&#39;s portraying.  I don&#39;t know much about P.T. Barnum offhand, and I don&#39;t want to read up too much about the movie to avoid biasing my initial reaction.  That kind of leaves me with two different ways to look at this movie: from the perspective of Barnum&#39;s character, and the aspect of inclusivity and respect for people who are different, which is a very strong theme running in the background throughout the whole film.<br><br>I think, as a portrayal of Barnum (or whatever level of flanderization of the real Barnum we&#39;re being presented with), it does incredibly well.  It shows us his early upbringing in poverty, the treatment he receives from people in the upper classes, and his desire to do something exciting and entertaining, rather than having a dull, typical job.  As his museum gains in popularity as it slowly develops closer to the modern concept of a circus, we see his ambition begin to ramp up, and the risks he&#39;s willing to take to find even more success, and the strain that begins to put on his family relationship.  All along, his imagination and desire to entertain is constantly on display.<br><br>It&#39;s the other plot thread/theme that doesn&#39;t work so well for me.  Don&#39;t get me wrong, the movie tries <i>really</i> hard, certainly more than most other Hollywood fair.  I don&#39;t know whether all the actors portraying the sideshow performers actually exhibit the traits of the people they represent from Barnum&#39;s real life—with the exception of the small person who played Tom Thumb, all the other physical traits could have been done with makeup or prop effects.  But the simple fact that this movie gives screen time to a woman with facial hair, an overweight man (in a non-punchline role), etc. puts it miles above the usual Hollywood method of using generally average-shaped people.  A lot of the songs also have incredibly powerful lyrics about facing society with your true self and not feeling shame for being different.  The one thing that weakens this part of the movie is, well, the other part.  This is very clearly Barnum&#39;s story, and the sideshow characters always get the back seat behind his narrative.  Actually, it&#39;s not only Barnum; a lot of focus is on his business partner and the trapeze artists he falls in love with.  To be fair, that last pair form an interracial couple in the nineteen twenties, so it fits in with the themes of class-ism and acceptance.  But that doesn&#39;t change the fact that the emotional focus of the movie is very heavily on three conventionally attractive characters.<br><br>The one failure that really ruins this movie for me is this: Barnum is at some fancy party, and when his sideshow employees try to enter, he bars them, very clearly because he doesn&#39;t want to be seen with them by the high society folks.  I was shocked at this point, because it was pretty bold of the movie to have its protagonist be so overtly terrible.  I was looking forward to the scene when they would confront him for this and call him on it . . . and I waited . . . and at some point, I got distracted by the flow of the movie, and only realized after I left the theater that the scene I had been waiting for didn&#39;t exist.  There are <i>no consequences</i> to Barnum for the way he treated his employees in that scene.  The next time they have a scene with Barnum, they&#39;re supporting him in a moment of doubt about the future of his circus.  Leaving out repercussions that way is the kind of mistake I would expect from a bad fanfiction, not from a movie shown in theaters.<br><br>I feel like a lot of the movie suffers from the problem of people not talking about problems enough.  It felt very rushed altogether.  Probably just personal preference as a book nerd who likes to stew over events between chapters, but I really could have done with more scenes of dialogue with characters discussing their feelings and motivations.  One subject in particular that suffered for this was the amount of phony effects the circus used.  The movie doesn&#39;t shy from this at all, but there&#39;s no real examination of it either.  Barnum gets called on it a few times, but always dismisses the criticism with a couple of sharp lines about people enjoying his show anyway.<br><br>Visually, the movie does an excellent job in costumes and sets of portraying 1920s New York.  The one thing that detracts from that is the music.  The music is <i>good</i>, don&#39;t get me wrong, I&#39;ll probably be listening to it on YouTube for the next couple of weeks.  But it feels very modern and pop-ish, and it really jarred me out of the time period all the way through.  Even a more timeless Broadway style of music would have worked fine, I think, but it sounded more like current radio music.  But two things that were amazing about the songs were the choreography and the percussion.  The choreography frequently went beyond just dancing, and they used very creative and unique motions to match the flow of the music.  The percussion for some songs was especially fun, as they used physical objects or simply people&#39;s stamping feet as the backing to the orchestra.<br><br>Oh, also, I&#39;m pretty sure all the animals were CGI, but I didn&#39;t mind that so much in this film, since they&#39;re often integrated into the song numbers, and all the flashing lights and humans jumping around erratically would have spooked animals pretty badly.  This movie gets a pass for that, although one scene at the end where Barnum rides a (CGI) elephant through snowy New York streets in winter and left it outside unattended while he watched his daughter do ballet was a little too ridiculous for me.<br><br>I know this was a pretty negative review, but honestly, I think this movie is worth seeing once, if it sounds interesting to you.  It didn&#39;t quite get to where I was wanting it to go, but it tried awfully hard, and the musical numbers are quite good.<br><br>Have a spoiler block.<br>This is the greatest spoiler.  This is the greatest spoiler.  This is the greatest spoiler.  This is the greatest spoiler.  This is the greatest spoiler.  This is the greatest spoiler.<br><br>—doctorlit, the Greatest Lowman</p>

            <p>So! First off, to prevent people stumbling across spoilers: shout-out to the aerialists just sorta hanging out on hoops in full arabesque in the background of the circus shots. That pose is hella painful and they were rocking it. This has been a spoiler block.<br><br>Elephant in the room: That was almost entirely unlike P.T. Barnum&#39;s actual life. He started poor, made a fortune primarily in showbiz, and had a slip into financial trouble when a business didn&#39;t turn out. And that&#39;s it- everything else in the film is made from whole cloth. His tour with Jenny Lind was wildly successful, his circus never broke up or burned down, the one big financial problem he had was when he tried to get into major real estate. (Although it was then his circus people, many of whom had gone on to their own acts, who got him back on his feet. But it wasn&#39;t a moment of desperation. And his home burned down during the process, not his circus.)<br><br>The music was incredible. It was perfect- because it was, very specifically, <i>circus music</i>. Too much story to be pop or modern dance, too much beat to be theater, and I&#39;ve got half a routine choreographed for each of those songs already. It&#39;s very cirque nouveau, specifically- the modern circus movement that&#39;s more about telling stories than just spectacle. All of it makes me want to get back into the air.<br><br>And the choreography... I&#39;m still a bit envious. That bit in the bar, particularly- that was such a circus piece, a discussion and decisions and dance, and the choreography was glorious and small and fast. You couldn&#39;t perform that piece for an audience of more than ten, because nobody else could be close enough to see all the details that make it sparkle. The big stuff was equally good- both the choreography and the performance.<br><br>So, now drifting into the stuff that wasn&#39;t so good.<br><br>You&#39;re right, the whole thing felt rushed. They banged around from scene to scene, it really feels like they could have let all of it soak in more.<br><br>I&#39;m not sure I see that one failing as a movie-ruiner- it&#39;s the arc of Barnum&#39;s story. He keeps chasing bigger and bigger things, and never stops to think about what he has- and that piled-up karma leads to his ruin. Jenny bails on him, destroying his fortune, the circus burns, Charity leaves- all of that crashes down on him in the fourth act. (And it&#39;s an extra twist of the knife to have Jenny singing &quot;all the stars in the sky, and it&#39;s never enough...&quot;) That&#39;s the consequences of his selfishness, his lack of awareness. And that moment where the people come back together? That&#39;s not just &quot;a moment of doubt,&quot; it&#39;s full-on ruin. His money is gone, his credit is shot, his properties are ruins or foreclosed, by the way he&#39;d been seeing the world, he had nothing- except for the people he&#39;d given a family.<br><br>Some of the editing also really didn&#39;t work for me. That moment at the end, where Barnum suddenly runs out of the bar, jumps on a train? I had no idea what he was doing. Was he running away? Were they jumping ahead to when the Barnum and Bailey circus traveled by train? Was it something else entirely?<br><br>Final shoutout- Zendaya worked <i>hard</i> to play an aerialist, and it showed. She... well, she wasn&#39;t doing anything terribly difficult? But she had really good form, and she sold it so well. And for someone who only had months to learn, she must have worked really hard.<br></p>

            <p>This is the greatest spoiler. This is the greatest spoiler. This is the greatest spoiler. This is the greatest spoiler. This is the greatest spoiler. This is the greatest spoiler.<br><br><i>His money is gone, his credit is shot, his properties are ruins or foreclosed, by the way he&#39;d been seeing the world, he had nothing- except for the people he&#39;d given a family.</i><br><br>My problem with that is, that I don&#39;t feel Barnum is entitled to that family&#39;s support any more.  He turned his back on the performers, and they never confronted him over that.  Then they&#39;re suddenly there to bolster him in his moment of disaster?  Why?  I mean, I guess you could simply argue that the performer characters are better people than character!Barnum, but . . . from my standpoint as a viewer, it still feels like a very arbitrary and artificial moment.<br><br>—doctorlit</p>
