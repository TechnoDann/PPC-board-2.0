            <p>Heyo, it&#39;s been so freaking long since I&#39;ve done a movie review! But in the wake of all the positive reactions, hype, and feels surrounding the <i>Black Panther</i> movie, I knew for a fact that I HAD to give it a review after seeing it this past weekend. I am so very glad that we got tickets in advance to watch it, because good golly, it is an absolute <i>masterpiece</i>. Word of warning, this review will be ridiculously spoiler-worthy - I know we&#39;ve been good with spoilers, but I&#39;ll put one below anyway so you guys can use it for replies to this post.<br><br>IT&#39;S GONNA TAKE A LOT TO DRAG ME AWAY FROM YOU, THERE&#39;S NOTHING THAT A HUNDRED MEN OR MORE COULD EVER DO, I BLESS THE RAINS DOWN IN AFRICA, GONNA TAKE SOME TIME TO DO THE THINGS WE NEVER HAD... IT&#39;S GONNA TAKE A LOT TO DRAG ME AWAY FROM YOU, THERE&#39;S NOTHING THAT A HUNDRED MEN OR MORE COULD EVER DO, I BLESS THE RAINS DOWN IN AFRICA, GONNA TAKE SOME TIME TO DO THE THINGS WE NEVER HAD... IT&#39;S GONNA TAKE A LOT TO DRAG ME AWAY FROM YOU, THERE&#39;S NOTHING THAT A HUNDRED MEN OR MORE COULD EVER DO, I BLESS THE RAINS DOWN IN AFRICA, GONNA TAKE SOME TIME TO DO THE THINGS WE NEVER HAD... IT&#39;S GONNA TAKE A LOT TO DRAG ME AWAY FROM YOU, THERE&#39;S NOTHING THAT A HUNDRED MEN OR MORE COULD EVER DO, I BLESS THE RAINS DOWN IN AFRICA, GONNA TAKE SOME TIME TO DO THE THINGS WE NEVER HAD...<br><br>Starting things off with the writing and characterization, I have to say that almost all the characters in the film were enjoyable and engaging to watch, and there were plenty of great moments from everyone concerned. T&#39;Challa, despite being the obvious star of the show, actually feels kinda stoic compared to the liveliness of quite a few of the secondary characters which I&#39;ll get to a bit later, but he still has a compelling storyline, and while I was worried that he&#39;d remain somewhat static throughout the movie, there were quite a few gut punches that ensured that he&#39;d grow as a person and also as a ruler. The movie did a good job of demonstrating that he had big shoes to fill in a metaphorical sense, and also that even if T&#39;Chaka had tried to be the best example that he could be for his son, his past mistakes would still come to light eventually and force T&#39;Challa to reevaluate his worldview. This is especially apparent when it becomes known that T&#39;Chaka, when he had donned the Black Panther suit, had been forced to kill the Wakandan traitor whose son would grow up to become Killmonger. It was a split-second decision driven by the impulse to save the life of the other Wakandan spy present, but the urge to keep up appearances for the sake of the nation ended up having far-reaching consequences that would&#39;ve resulted in far more unnecessary casualties if T&#39;Challa and later M&#39;Baku and his tribe hadn&#39;t intervened. That kind of split-second decision is mirrored in the story in general, when T&#39;Challa&#39;s lack of information regarding Killmonger&#39;s origin story almost costs him the throne and even his life, only being saved by the intervention of M&#39;Baku and his remaining allies&#39; delivery of the last Heart-Shaped Herb. Eventually, after fighting his way back to his own kingdom, he&#39;s forced to deal with Killmonger using the only remaining option left after the failure of diplomacy and civility, through violence and possible death. This history essentially repeating itself is one of the biggest contributions to T&#39;Challa&#39;s character growth, and also his decision to make Wakanda a more publicly open nation willing to use its resources to aid the world at large in the end. It shows that he&#39;s realized how much impact even very short-term decisions can have in a sort of ripple effect, as well as the major setback of trying to lock Wakanda as a whole behind figurative closed doors: that sort of isolationism prevents you from interacting with the world around you and, like it or not, making the kinds of mistakes needed to move forward.<br><br>Naturally, since T&#39;Challa sets a pretty high bar, the secondary characters and antagonists kinda have to settle for being second fiddle, but they all have traits of their own that help move the plot forward. The main antagonist, the aforementioned Killmonger, is interesting among the other Marvel villains in that instead of the typical &quot;KILL EVERYTHING&quot; or &quot;take over the world&quot; MO (or sometimes both) without many reasons other than &quot;MWAHAHA I&#39;M EVIL&quot;, he actually has a rather valid and understandable reason for his actions. The recent instances of black people being persecuted simply for their color, even in the modern day and age, are a strong force of motivation grounded in a sad reality, although the means by which Killmonger was planning to achieve that goal - by waging war on every other race - were undoubtedly going to cause as many problems as they&#39;d solve if not more. Another interesting factor is how Killmonger&#39;s rule essentially divides up the entire nation; while Shuri (whom I&#39;ll get to later) is loyal to T&#39;Challa through and through, and goes out of her way to help him and his cause, other characters like Okoye (initially) and W&#39;Kabi simply serve the man in the throne whether or not he&#39;s truly fighting for the force of good. This actually threatens to tear the nation apart during Killmonger&#39;s campaign, and again, it&#39;s only because T&#39;Challa and M&#39;Baku&#39;s tribe join forces to stop him that things don&#39;t escalate into all-out carnage. As a wise man once said, hate begets hate - whether you think it&#39;s justified or not, the total extermination of people who are different than you, even if a few gave you grief in the past, is the wrong way to act, and only makes you like those very people who attacked you first. I have to give props to T&#39;Challa for not falling into the same trap that his father did and offing Killmonger directly; instead, he attempted to show mercy, as well as a Wakandan sunset like in the tales Killmonger had heard as a child, but rather than spend life in prison with his reputation in shambles, Killmonger chose to essentially commit suicide and end the cycle. Even if he nearly caused an all-out civil war within the Wakandan borders, Killmonger is still a tragic figure, and that makes a big impact on all of us.<br><br>My favorite character by far, however, has to be Shuri. It&#39;s established very early on that she&#39;s not only a child prodigy, but also a youthful, spunky teenager with a wholesome sense of humor (and in at least three instances, a penchant for memery, trolling, and cringe-inducing puns on almost the same level as Chibi Yang). While she seems to be a light-hearted comic relief, though, she also plays one of the most critical roles in the story - rescuing the Heart-Shaped Herb that would later be given to T&#39;Challa for his second wind - and her humor is offset by a dedication to her responsibilities as well as her intimate knowledge of the ins and outs of the Black Panther role as well as his loyalty to T&#39;Challa regardless of the situation. It&#39;s probably this that leads to her being so important in helping T&#39;Challa recover, and I&#39;m proud of her for being both the heart of the movie (T&#39;Challa, of course, being the soul) and a nuanced and lovable character in her own right.<br><br>The writing of the movie is also quite well done due to the points noted above and much more. Racism, prejudice, loyalty, and the impact of even the smallest things are themes that are prominent throughout the entire movie. I was very concerned that the sole major white character, Everett Ross, would turn out to be a villain (though thankfully that wasn&#39;t the case, and he gets an awesome support role in the climax that Han Solo would be proud of), and Ulysses Klaue IS a secondary antagonist, but it&#39;s interesting that ultimately, the conflict is waged by blacks, among blacks. This ties into the concept that there is no such thing as reverse racism - even if it&#39;s blacks persecuting whites, it&#39;s still way over the line if it isn&#39;t in self-defense. The conflicting solutions proposed by T&#39;Challa and Killmonger - coming to terms with the outside world and reaching out to lend aid to it vs. only looking out for your own and forsaking all others to keep them from harm - are an uncomfortable mirror to a lot of real-world politics in recent years, but in true MCU tradition, it&#39;s the idealistic approach that wins the day in the end, although as expected for a conflict as intense as this, there are still quite a few casualties at the end of it all, and unlike many other instances in the MCU and beyond, most of these are impactful and placed tactfully enough to move the story forward.<br><br>I dont&#39; even need to say that the graphics and visuals of this movie are absolutely gorgeous. Wakanda as a city is stunning, the various African landscapes breathtaking, and the vehicle design and choreography as masterful as a Star Wars movie. The costume and character design as well are splendid, and it is at this point that I&#39;d like to call attention to the costume designer for this movie: Ruth E. Carter, who&#39;s also done work for such films as &quot;Malcom X&quot; and &quot;School Daze&quot; - plus she&#39;s African, and has done extensive research for this movie&#39;s designs, drawing from a wide variety of African cultures. Really, this entire movie is a feast for the eyes and absolutely worth seeing for that fact alone. My one gripe is that the war rhinos seen early in the movie and then in the climax are notably CGI, and could&#39;ve been improved with some animatronic work like in the first Jurassic Park movie (or heck, they could even have used real rhinos, but IDK how much hassle that would&#39;ve resulted in), but that&#39;s a minor quibble that doesn&#39;t detract from an otherwise spectacular feature.<br><br>I&#39;m well aware that complaints about this movie have had to be filtered extensively on RottenTomatoes to prevent Internet Racism(TM) from marring the reviews unnecessarily, but that&#39;s a can of worms I&#39;m not going into for the sake of my dignity. On my own terms, however, I do have one suggestion for improving the movie: instead of murdering Klaue just halfway through the movie, Killmonger could&#39;ve just as easily pounded him into submission and forced him to work for him as a sort of Dragon (in TV Tropes lingo). T&#39;Challa and Ross vs. Killmonger and Klaue would&#39;ve been interesting to see, especially considering how threatening Klaue was with his cyborg arm and what it could do to both T&#39;Challa and those poor innocent vehicles involved in the car chase in Korea. He&#39;d have made an interesting secondary antagonist that could&#39;ve opportunistically interfered with the warring parties and stirred up tensions just to tear down Wakanda out of spite. I&#39;m not about to suggest an &quot;Everett vs. Klaue&quot; scenario - which was actually what Everett was planning in the first place when he entered this movie - but giving Klaue a bigger role before he gets offed would&#39;ve made said murder more impactful and karmatic after all he&#39;s done. That&#39;s largely splitting hairs, though - I&#39;m sure there are people who instead feel that Killmonger getting rid of Klaue early prevents competition. Who knows?<br><br>On a final note, here are two things I really want to see in future MCU films: 1) a movie with a predominantly Asian cast and setting, and 2) a movie starring Devil Freaking Dinosaur. I&#39;ll admit that both of these are kinda self-centered, but the first one in particular is probably more desirable at large because there aren&#39;t that many Asian characters at all in the MCU (Mantis from Guardians of the Galaxy 2 and Colleen Wing from the Iron Fist TV show are probably the only ones I can think of off the top of my head, though I may have missed a few more), but one of the big things I&#39;m noticing from the Black Panther release is that African-American and black children have come to look up to him as a hero in the same way that a lot of girls look up to Wonder Woman with the number growing since her own film release. A quick look at the Marvel Comics online archives presents me with Shang-Chi, Master of Kung Fu, who has actually joined the Avengers and would make a very interesting and cool addition to their MCU incarnation. As for Devil Dinosaur, I don&#39;t even need to explain why he&#39;d become beloved if he ever shows up in a MCU movie, even as a minor character... just keep him away from the palaeo-discourse and he should be fine. XD<br><br>All in all, Black Panther isn&#39;t a perfect movie, but it&#39;s very close to being one and I&#39;m so happy for its success. While there are a few minor things I feel would&#39;ve been worth fixing here and there, I don&#39;t see any obvious faults and certainly none that detract from how amazing it is. Do yourself a favor and give it a spin - I can promise that you&#39;ll be in for a visual and auditory treat from start to finish.<br><br><b>Grading Scheme:</b><br>- 96 - 100: A+<br>- 93 - 96: A<br>- 90 - 92.9: A-<br>- 87 - 89.9: B+<br>- 83 - 86.9: B<br>- 80 - 82.9: B-<br>- 77 - 79.9: C+<br>- 73 - 76.9: C<br>- 70 - 72.9: C-<br>- 67 - 69.9: D+<br>- 60 - 66.9: D<br>- Below 60: E<br><br><b>Grades:</b><br>- Writing: 9<br>- Characterization: 9<br>- Pacing: 8<br>- Creativity: 9<br>- Consistency: 9<br>- Cinematography: 10<br>- World Building: 9<br>- Music and Sound: 10<br>- Effects: 9<br>- Engagement: 9<br><br><b>Final Grade:</b> 91 (A-)</p>

            <p>(Heeeey Skarm.  Sorry for tacking on again, but they <i>are</i> both MCU, eh?)<br><br>So to my mind, they are two halves to the Marvel Cinematic Universe.  There&#39;s the half with all the good material, and there&#39;s the half with the two <i>Guardians</i> films and <i>Ant-Man</i>.  Yeah.  I know it&#39;s not a popular opinion, but those three are my least favorite films of the series. I&#39;ve seen a lot of complaints lately that Marvel films have a problem with undercutting serious moments with out-of-place humor.  Honestly, I think the majority of the films and TV shows are at a pretty good balance in that regard.  Except for my disliked three.  A-M and the the two GotGs put way too much focus on humor.  A-M I didn&#39;t mind quite as much as the GotGs, mostly because I really liked Hank Pym, Hope and especially Cross.  But the first GotG had basically nothing I really liked, apart from the mix tape&#39;s use as the soundtrack throughout the film.  The constant lack of seriousness made it hard for me to reconcile that film as existing in the same universe as the <i>Captain America</i>s and <i>Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.</i>s, etc.<br><br>That said, I think the sequel was a big improvement over the first, though that same problem of overbearing, idiotic humor is still present.  We got to know all the characters a whole lot better this time, other than Quill.  I think that&#39;s fine, though—we got pretty much all we needed to know about Quill in the first movie.  I&#39;m glad they gave all the other characters chances to open up, especially Rocket, Yondu, and Gamora and her sister.  I also liked the little scene between Dax and Mantis, where Dax is talking about his lost family members with a fairly neutral and expressionless face and tone.  Then Mantis touches him, and immediately starts crying.  It shows us that Dax really is as emotionally deep as the others can be, and just doesn&#39;t show it.  Although that makes me wish he wasn&#39;t always used as an outlet for stupid jokes.<br><br>Ego was a fun villain, definitely an improvement over Ronin in the last film, who was basically just a personalityless vehicle to introduce another Infinity Stone into the series.  The actor who played him whose name I can&#39;t be bothered to look up did a good job of playing up the self confidence of an immortal being.  He&#39;s all powerful and very self-absorbed, but is confident enough about it that he doesn&#39;t feel any need to boast constantly.  He knows he&#39;s powerful, and that&#39;s enough.  His evil plan feels like a reasonable extension of his identity.  It&#39;s the sort of inhuman thought process you would expect a creature like a Celestial to have.  All around, I rather liked him.<br><br>I was also pleasantly surprised by the resolution between Gamora and her sister.  The sister had been a fairly flat villain in the original, as well, and for a while, it looked like that was going to continue.  She was threatening to kill Gamora at the outset, but then (and in an example of a moment of humor I <i>did</i> appreciate), she was satisfied with finally besting Gamora in combat.  After that point, the relationship between them finally evolves past violence, and they start having the discussions they should have had all along.  I wish the sister had decided to join in with the heroes in the end, but I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll be reunited against Thanos during <i>Infinity Wars</i> anyway.<br><br>I really liked the one space dogfight in the beginning.  The . . . choreography? of the ship movements was very different and cool-looking.  The detail that the . . . gold people . . . were actually being logical and piloting their fighters remotely was both amusing, and fitting for that culture&#39;s characterization.  Why should they dirty their hands with fighting out in space?<br><br>Although that does lead me to another problem that carried over from the original movie: too many alien characters look and talk like humans in face makeup.  The entire race of gold people, the green lady, the handful of blue folks.  And a lot of them have accents from Earth English dialects.  It just makes them feel like they have no unique cultures out there in space, it&#39;s all just weird technicolor transplants of humanity.  I am told the aliens in the original GotG comics are like that, so at least it&#39;s a faithful adaptation in that regard, but I still don&#39;t like it.<br><br>And yeah.  Still way too much adolescent humor for me.  I got enough of that nonsense back in grade school and junior high.  It wasn&#39;t funny then, and it isn&#39;t funny now.  I&#39;m not really looking forward to the Guardians showing up in <i>Infinity Wars</i>, because then I&#39;ll have to put up with it even more.  Joy.<br><br>—doctorlit, the token stick-in-the-mud MCU fan<br><br>&quot;We&#39;re really gonna be able to jack up our spoilers if we&#39;re two-time galaxy savers.&quot; &quot;We&#39;re really gonna be able to jack up our spoilers if we&#39;re two-time galaxy savers.&quot; &quot;We&#39;re really gonna be able to jack up our spoilers if we&#39;re two-time galaxy savers.&quot;</p>

            <p>I forgot to talk about Shuri in my own review!  I super-duper love that the smartest character in the movie is a teenage girl—and let&#39;s face it, she&#39;s probably the smartest character in the entire MCU, considering the level of tech she&#39;s working with.  Tony Stark, eat your heart out.  But I also like that she does very much have a good heart, as well.  Despite her cracks about Ross being a &quot;white boy&quot; and &quot;colonizer,&quot; she was clearly more concerned about his welfare than stopping the weapons shipments during the final sequence, telling him to leave the simulation before the barrier around the lab could be destroyed.  Actually, the fact that she remodeled the simulator to feel like a U.S. airplane is interesting too.  She spent the moments leading up to the final battle in exile from her lab, so she certainly couldn&#39;t have made that modification in the instants before Ross needed it, nor could she have any knowledge that such an attack on Wakandan ships would be necessary.  The only time she could have changed the program to have U.S. plane features would have been while Ross was recovering, which shows she respected his opinion and flight record enough that she wanted to show him the program after he healed, and ask his opinion on her programming.  It also seems, from the final after-credits scene. that she has been responsible for rehabilitating Bucky Barnes.  I wonder if he was removed from cold storage at her urging?  Definitely a complex and strong-minded character.<br><br>I did notice the rhinos were rather poor CGI, but there was so much going on in the movie, I easily dismissed that purely aesthetic issue.  Actually, come to think of it, there must have been some moments, like the car chase and the fight in the vibranium mines, where the panther suits themselves had to be CGI as well, but I couldn&#39;t tell at all while I watched, either because they looked that good, or because, again, the story was so gripping I  was just too focused on it to notice the effects.<br><br>The one Asian character you missed in your list is Skye on <i>Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.</i> and her mother, but I don&#39;t want to say too much about them in case you aren&#39;t caught up yet.  But I definitely agree it would be nice to see further diversity moving forward.<br><br>—doctorlit, realizing that the vibranium in Bucky&#39;s old arm seems completely unaccounted for in the timeline of &quot;vibranium that has left Wakanda&quot;</p>

            <p>There&#39;s also Agent May, and Wong the super-librarian from <i>Doctor Strange</i>. Plus various supporting characters around them, but they&#39;re fairly minor. On the flip side, I don&#39;t think you can count Mantis as an Asian character - that would be like claiming Jar Jar Binks as a black man.<br><br>I feel like one of the Iron Man villains was Asian? The Mandarin pretended to be, I think, but wasn&#39;t the guy with the whips from somewhere on that continent?<br><br>Anyway, yeah, we don&#39;t have an Asian-heavy MCU film any more than we have a woman-centred one (and it should go without saying that &#39;only one&#39; isn&#39;t the solution here!). Captain Marvel may start to address the latter point; do you have any ideas for Marvel comics/characters who either are or could be Asian-centred? (Doc Strange and Iron Fist don&#39;t count, at this point.)<br><br>hS</p>

            <p>I have no idea how I overlooked Agent May.  Dumb, dumb, dumb.<br><br>Forgot about the librarian, too.  And, let&#39;s see.  I think season one, maybe two, of <i>Agents</i> had that episode with the fire-powered Japanese guy, but he got killed off.  And <i>Daredevil</i> had some villains, Lady Gao (though I&#39;m not clear yet whether she&#39;s really human or not), and the entire Hand, plus the Black Sky child.  I believe that plotline gets picked up in <i>Iron Fist</i> from what my brother has said, but I haven&#39;t gotten there yet.  As for the Mandarin, I&#39;m not sure what that character was supposed to be, even in-universe.  I think the actor was going for &quot;generically scary foreigner.&quot;  Not sure why they didn&#39;t cast Killian as Asian, if they were going to give him that big &quot;I AM THE MANDARIN&quot; line at the end, anyway.  Whiplash was Russian, though.  Oh, and one of Thor&#39;s warrior friends in from that Japan-inspired realm, but again, that&#39;s the &quot;Asian character&quot; vs. &quot;alien character that looks like and is portrayed by an Asian actor&quot; weirdness.<br><br>I don&#39;t really know the comics that well.  If they ever adapt Morbius&#39;s side of the Spider-Man canon, they could make him Romanian/Transylvanian like he was in the very excellent 90s Spider-Man cartoon, which is sort of arguable west-Asian, but I suspect they&#39;ll stick with the comics canon of making him Greek.  I also randomly know of this Fin Fang Foom, an eastern-inspired dragon who would almost certainly be CGI, but ought to at least have an Asian voice actor.  One should hope.  And I&#39;ve just come across mention of this <a href="http://marvelcinematicuniverse.wikia.com/wiki/List_of_Undeveloped_Movies#The_Hands_of_Shang-Chi">Shang-Chi</a>, which sounds like it could be a legitimately Asian culture-focused movie in the same way BP was for Africa.<br><br>—doctorlit really wants that Morbius-and-Blade movie, now that he&#39;s thought of the idea</p>

            <p>(Hope you don&#39;t mind me tacking on, Skarm?)<br><br>My brother wanted to see <i>Black Panther</i> in theaters with me, but the only night we could do so this month was Saturday, in the middle of my work week.  So Sunday was a terrible, slow day for me, and I didn&#39;t get as much done as I wanted.  But the payoff was Monday, when I happened to be driving past a certain service gate in my golf cart when a radio call went out that an ambulance was coming to attend a zoo guest who had had a seizure, and that someone needed to open the service gate immediately.  The ambulance arrived less than half a minute later.  I have to wonder, if my brother hadn&#39;t had me out past my bedtime Saturday, and ruined my productivity Sunday, would anyone else have been close enough to that gate on Monday to let the ambulance in immediately?  I don&#39;t know, but I do know this has been a Wildly Off-Topic Spoiler Block.<br><br>So yeah, <i>Black Panther</i> is amazing, and I barely know where to start.  As usual, I won&#39;t really know characters&#39; names, because I&#39;m terrible at catching characters&#39; names while I&#39;m watching something on film, and I&#39;m not going to look them up to avoid having outside information affecting my initial reaction.  Of course, this initial reaction is based on notes I took two days ago, but uuuuuh<br><br>The way the designers made Wakanda appear on-screen is incredible.  The mix of futuristic, modern technology, and the uniquely shaped skyscrapers, mixed with all the costuming, body paint, weaponry and names make Wakanda entirely distinctive from any other setting, ever.  I love that it combines science fiction, comic book technology with traditional African aesthetics and values.  It really gets across how Wakanda has kept itself sheltered over the millennia, developing new technologies at its own pace, and without outside influence undermining its traditions.<br><br>Maybe it just seems this way to me because I don&#39;t watch a whole lot of movies, but the plot of BP feels incredibly unique to me.  I can&#39;t think of another story to compare it to.  The use of royal bloodline interaction to fuel the conflict not only reinforces Wakanda&#39;s heavy reliance on tradition, but causes the plot to advance in a way that made the whole story feel unpredictable and engaging.  The characters&#39; motives and restrictions were a bit foreign and outside my ability to understand at a glance, so it forced me to stay captivated and follow along with the action.  The battle sequence at the end, too: what movie about a fantasy culture features a civil war at the end, with fellow citizens turning on each other to push different ideologies forward?  That part actually made me feel bad, seeing people who should have been allies attacking each other, but it reinforces the idea that I was observing aspects of a foreign culture.<br><br>Speaking of conflict, I really liked both major villains in this movie.  Killmonger is such a memorable figure because you can see the logic to both his motivation and goals.  His aims are violent and destructive, but you can sympathize with him through his history and the real life plight of the disenfranchised around the world.  I also liked the contrast between his calculating mind, planning abilities, and combat skills, and his stereotypically &quot;punkish&quot; speaking mannerisms.  It defies the way movies normally portray characters with those traits, which made Killmonger an incredibly fun and active character to watch on screen.  I also really liked Claue&#39;s constantly excited, almost manic attitude to . . . anything, really.  I don&#39;t remember him being lack that back in <i>Avengers: Age of Ultron</i>.  I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s due to different writing/directing, or just because he got overshadowed by Ultron at the time (also a fun-to-watch-and-listen-to villain).  The drawback to me liking both villains so much  is, of course, that they both got killed off.  I&#39;m actually getting pretty tired of the MCU writing out its villains that way.  Aside from the socially problematic, and media-wide, issue of constantly portraying conflicts as solvable only with violence and life-taking, it sucks when you like a villain, and know you&#39;re never going to get to see them again in this very long movie series.  (Who else really liked Yellow Jacket in <i>Ant-Man?</i>  Literally no one but me?  Okay.)<br><br>The soundtrack was cool.  I think it&#39;s definitely the most memorable MCU soundtrack to date.  I don&#39;t usually take much notice of the music in a movie while I&#39;m watching it, but in this one, I especially liked the traditional vs. modern motifs that represented T&#39;Challa and Wakanda with African tribal music, and Killmonger with hip-hop.<br><br>As we left the theater, my brother said he &quot;hated all the white-shaming.&quot;  Well, uh.  I thought the &quot;white-shaming&quot; was freaking hilarious.  Honestly, I like how the usual roles of white and minority characters got reversed in this.  Goes to show that Hollywood&#39;s perceived &quot;appealing to the majority/baseline&quot; is garbage.  Everett Ross, in particular, was interesting.  I didn&#39;t expect we would even see him again after his purely bureaucratic role in <i>Captain America: Civil War</i>.  I now remember he was in the trailers for BP, but I had forgotten that when I started watching the movie, and was surprised to see him appear.  I was further surprised that he joined in the ensuing shootout, and again at the end when he was forced to put his piloting skills to use in the final conflict.  It fits back in with what I said earlier about Killmonger, taking a character who was presented as a pure dialogue dispenser in his previous appearance, and allowing him to show off other traits and skills that one wouldn&#39;t expect to see in his character archetype.  I also love that Ross&#39;s last push to stop the weapons distributions required T&#39;Challa&#39;s sister to instruct him in making a Wakandan arm gesture.  Very appropriate!<br><br>—doctorlit will totally respond to Skarm&#39;s review a bit later today, wanted to get this down before the movie faded too much from his mind<br><br>&quot;They&#39;re sitting on an entire mountain of spoilers, and they&#39;ve been mining it for centuries.&quot;  &quot;They&#39;re sitting on an entire mountain of spoilers, and they&#39;ve been mining it for centuries.&quot;  &quot;They&#39;re sitting on an entire mountain of spoilers, and they&#39;ve been mining it for centuries.&quot;</p>

            <p>Séverine stirred the soup furiously, sloshing it over the sides of the pot.  Ignoring the splashes of soup that were now burning into crusts on the stove top, she called, &quot;Please hurry, Yoof!  Lyn&#39;s team finished nearly ten minutes ago!&quot;  She gave a pained glance to the wheeled serving cart behind her, where a solid cubic meter of steaming lasagna stood imperiously on a tray in the center.<br><br>Yoof whined, &quot;Hnnnnnn, I know, Séverine!

Séverine, I forgot to mix any yeast into this dough before I baked it!  It&#39;s all short now.&quot;<br><br>Séverine let her breath out.  &quot;That is fine, Yoof!  That just means that you have made flatbread.&quot;<br><br>Yoof&#39;s ears perked up.  &quot;I didn&#39;t even know I knew how to make flatbread!  But now I know that I know it!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Indeed, Yoof, indeed.&quot;  Séverine poured her finished soup into a serving tray that would fit in the salad bar.<br><br>Another agent skidded to a halt next to the cart, somehow keeping the pitcher she held from spilling.  &quot;Oh, crap!&quot; she yelled.  &quot;I totally spaced and forgot to put any sugar in the lemonade!  I&#39;ve got to fix it or it&#39;ll be all bitter.&quot;  She spun around, ready to head back to her work space.<br><br>&quot;There is no time!&quot; Séverine said, her voice high-pitched.  &quot;Just set it with the rest!  If anyone complains, we can call it &#39;all-natural&#39; or &#39;diet&#39; or something.  If they don&#39;t like it—&quot;<br><br>&quot;Don&#39;t read it!&quot; Yoof chimed in, smiling.<br><br>&quot;Something like that.&quot;  Séverine lifted the tray of soup and quickly carried it over to the cart, letting it slam down next to the lasagna cube, and sloshing soup onto the cart and floor.  The agent with the lemonade placed her pitcher on the other side.<br><br>A man sat in a chair nearby, playing <i>Candy Crush</i> on his phone.  &quot;Oh, right.  I forgot I had a kitchen shift,&quot; he monotoned.  &quot;Consequently, I forgot to actually do anything involving food.&quot;<br><br>The other three cafeteria workers stared at him for several moments.  Finally, Séverine said, &quot;For God&#39;s sake, man.  Even this division has <i>some</i> standards.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Oh?  Well, maybe you should try heating those up some time.&quot;  He never looked up from the screen.<br><br>Séverine blinked.  &quot;&#39;Standards&#39; is not a kind of food, you imbecile.&quot;<br><br>He mumbled, &quot;Maybe they will be if you heat them long enough.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Ugh!  Never mind him,&quot; Séverine said as Yoof stuck his flatbread loaf on top of the pitcher.  &quot;We have plenty of food to send out into the dining hall.  Lyn&#39;s lasagna looks fine, and my soup is flawless.  <i>I</i> did not forget anything.&quot; As she said this, she wheeled the cart through the big double doors and out of the kitchen.<br><br>And right into a mob of agents wielding pitchforks, torches, and furious glares.<br><br>&quot;All right.

            <p>Late evening in Response Center 1110. Chance of a new mission coming in: slight but not zero. Opportunities for extracurricular carousing: exhausted. Fellrazer and the minis: fed, watered, and settled into their corners. As for the agents . . .<br><br>Derik sat at the console desk, hand-writing their latest mission report. He was a hopelessly slow typist, and he appreciated the luxury of having paper freely available to write on with high-quality ink. Like anyone who had copied records under Master Archivist Arnor and not been kicked out, his handwriting was small and neat, and had become rather pretty with the freedom he now had to flourish.<br><br>Gall was cross-legged on the floor, sealing and labeling vials of the latest batch of Monstrous Nightmare Gel collected from Fellrazer. Selling the very useful commodity, which had started out simply as a means to keep the dragon fed without resorting to robbery, had turned into a serious enterprise. Gall had somewhat ingeniously expanded it by expanding her dragon at every opportunity, courtesy of the collar that normally kept him shrunk down to large-dog-size instead of large-horse-size: it worked in reverse, too. The bigger the dragon, the greater the volume of flammable saliva produced, the greater the profits. Some people might have questioned the physics of this, but such thoughts never crossed Gall&#39;s mind. It worked, because she wanted it to.<br><br>She had a habit of humming to herself while she worked, which Derik had grown to tolerate. Her voice wasn&#39;t <i>bad</i>, and she could carry a tune when she felt like it, but she often didn&#39;t bother with anything like a melody, just meandered aimlessly through pitches for which the notation he&#39;d learned had no signs. He understood there were musical traditions that encouraged this sort of thing; he didn&#39;t think Gall&#39;s was actually one of them.<br><br>She stopped. He looked down at her, eyebrows raised in an inquiry.<br><br>She had a quizzical look on her face, her mouth pursed to one side. &quot;Do you ever get the feeling you forgot something, but you can&#39;t think what?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Sometimes I think I&#39;ve forgotten more than I ever knew,&quot; Derik said. &quot;Why?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I&#39;ve got it now, and it&#39;s really annoying.&quot;<br><br>He turned in his chair to face her more fully. The report would keep. &quot;Well, is it something you were supposed to do?&quot;<br><br>She shook her head. &quot;No way. We did the mission; I flew and fed and de-drooled Fellrazer; the minis got their bacon and bouillabaisse; if I polished my mace any more it might blind your other eye; I haven&#39;t even <i>worn</i> my armor lately, let alone needed to clean it.&quot; She rapped her knuckles impatiently against her thigh as she thought. &quot;Seriously, the hell?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Laundry?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Your turn this week, dude.&quot;<br><br>Derik grimaced; it was, and he hated it. &quot;Plans? Anything you should have told me about and haven&#39;t?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I don&#39;t <i>think</i> so.&quot; More rapping. &quot;I told you I&#39;m doing the thing with the kids again, right?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yes; I think I expressed my feeling that I still can&#39;t believe they <i>let</i> you.&quot;<br><br>Gall grinned. &quot;Hey, Fellrazer and me are totally ambassadors for our universe. It&#39;s <i>educational</i>.&quot;<br><br>&quot;And obscenely dangerous.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Whaaat? We strap them on, so the worst that can happen to them is they puke, which is totally outside my control. Not my fault if they keep shouting &#39;do a barrel-roll!&#39; and he&#39;s so well-trained he just reacts like a pro.&quot; She snickered, and Fellrazer, having lifted his head at the sound of his name, joined in with the odd hollow chortling noise that was the Nightmare&#39;s laughter.<br><br>Derik&#39;s jaw dropped open a moment. &quot;That&#39;s not what I was talking about—but good <i>grief</i>, tell me that did not really happen.&quot;<br><br>Gall&#39;s grin got wider. &quot;Hey, don&#39;t worry! We have DOGA agents on standby for when we do the flame jacket demo.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Self-admitted pyromaniacs. This does not inspire me with confidence. And you didn&#39;t answer me.&quot;<br><br>&quot;If you&#39;re so concerned, you should come next time,&quot; Gall said, leaning back on her elbows. She managed to do this with her legs still crossed, which made for an unusual view. &quot;You could do the whole boring health and safety thing, and then our butts would be covered and we could get on with the important part: having fun.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I&#39;m busy, and no, I will not be your liability waiver.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Aw, come on, you gotta take a break from your boyfriend sometime.&quot; Gall used her most ingratiating tone, which was both transparently insincere and irritating. &quot;Have I mentioned lately that that bullshit is bullshit?&quot;<br><br>Derik grinned. He was going to win this game. &quot;What, the part where you&#39;re jealous? Would it help if I gave you all the sordid details of what we get up to, locked away together in that exceedingly tiny response center for hours on end?&quot;<br><br>&quot;<i>Ugh</i>. You suck—no pun, because that would be interesting and you are <i>so</i> boring and lame.&quot; Gall flopped all the way down onto her back and stared up at the ceiling. &quot;What were we even talking about?&quot;<br><br>Chuckling to himself, Derik shrugged and turned back to his report. &quot;I forget.&quot;<br><br><hr>
<br>I tried to get Gall to talk to me and give me something to work with here, because I really need to develop her more, but she wasn&#39;t cooperating. So I took having no idea what she might have been forgetting and ran with it, and this is what happened. {= P<br><br>~Neshomeh</p>

            <p>Dunno why, but I generally enjoy the kind of &quot;rambling-goes-nowhere&quot; type of story. And this was a good example of that.<br><br>Honestly, I don&#39;t have any real criticism for this (as usual: I need to be better at finding things), so here&#39;s some stray observations:<br><br>-I have a soft spot for characters that reject reality and substitute their own. As such, Gall&#39;s dragon logic amuses me.<br><br>-I am actually a worse singer than Gall. In any case, that is a magnificently fun description, which is always a thing you tend to be good at. Writing fun descriptions, I mean.<br><br>-Honestly, I&#39;d trust a pyromaniac the most with fire safety. A pyro who doesn&#39;t do safety well is a dead pyro.<br><br>-I knew that Gal would get a line of mockery over Thoth and Derik at some point. It&#39;s as amusing as I expected it to be.<br><br>-What bullshit? (No really, what? I&#39;m not entirely sure what Gall&#39;s referencing here, just that it as something to do with Derik and Thoth&#39;s arrangement. I&#39;m kinda curious).<br><br>-&quot;Would it help if I gave you all the sordid details of what we get up to, locked away together in that exceedingly tiny response center for hours on end?&quot; This line is even funnier for me, because I know PRECISELY what they get up to.

            <p>She walked up to the man slowly as he stood by the dressing table. He was barely more than a boy, really, but muscular in a lean kind of way, a swimmer&#39;s build. He had sleek dark hair and piercing silver eyes, gazing out from behind some fashionable - and, she knew, highly advanced - thick-rimmed black spectacles. He was wearing an excellently tailored suit that fit him very well indeed, emphasising his physique and teaming well with the long Japanese sword he wore at his waist. Everyone assumed it was an affectation, right up until he killed them with it, like he had that commoner during training.<br><br>&quot;Agent Morgan,&quot; she said, cutting the primness with just a little suggestiveness - it was how he liked to be addressed.<br><br>&quot;Well, hey there, Roxy.&quot; He turned and smiled, gleaming, white, perfect. &quot;And I told you already, you don&#39;t need to call me what that meddling old coot Arthur does. The special people in my life call me Bandit, and the people I love?&quot; He walked closer, running his hand over her back. &quot;Well, they get to call me Storm.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yes - Storm - of, of course.&quot; The blonde shivered at Storm&#39;s touch, but then, so many women did. &quot;I... I just came by to give you this.&quot; She held up a small box.<br><br>&quot;Aw, thank you, Roxy! What&#39;s the occasion?&quot; Storm was already unwrapping the box&#39;s sober navy paper and white ribbon and plucking out the bottle of aftershave.<br><br>&quot;Just the occasion of us being... us, I suppose,&quot; she replied. &quot;Or you being you.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Heh, guess all that world-savin&#39; is paying off a li&#39;l, huh?&quot; He smiled again, sleek and white and evenly spaced as a military cemetery. &quot;Man, and here I was thinking I&#39;d get British girls just with the accent.&quot; He quirked an eyebrow.<br><br>She blushed a little and giggled. &quot;It helps, Morg- Storm. It certainly helps.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yeah?&quot; Storm put the present down on his dresser and moved towards her. &quot;Is it helpin&#39; now, Roxy?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yes and no,&quot; she said, smiling. &quot;Yes, because I like an accent, and no because, well...&quot; She stood up, tossed her hair back, and <i>changed</i>.<br><br>&quot;Storm Valerian Gunner,&quot; said the short, mousy-haired brunette in front of him, &quot;also known as Agent Morgan, also known as Callsign: Bandit, you are charged with bending the Kingsman canon into an n-dimensional pretzel, killing the series main character to take his place, being an American Kingsman agent, being a secret ninja lord Kingsman agent, getting all blood in my hair from when you decapitated all those people, turning Roxy Morton into a quivering damsel to be rescued and bonked by you, taking Merlin&#39;s job despite being a field agent and also impossibly dense, getting <i>blood</i> in my <i>hair</i> do you know how long it takes to wash that stuff out, and generally being a Gary Stu of the first order. Not the First Order first order, because this isn&#39;t a Star Wars crossover, thank God, but still. Your sentence is death. Any last words?&quot;<br><br>&quot;What?&quot; Storm unsheathed his sword and brandished it at her. &quot;Who are you, and what did you do with Roxy.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Those&#39;ll do me,&quot; said Cassie Aubrey, and she sped out the room and slammed the door shut behind her.<br><br>Her partner sidled over as the Stu began hacking at the door with his katana. &quot;Damn, girl, that stunt took some hella balls!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Em?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I mean, there&#39;s balls, and then there&#39;s <i>balls</i>, ya dig?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Em!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Because I totally get that you&#39;re not into them but hot damn, Cass, those are some <i>huevos muchachos</i> ya got-&quot;<br><br>&quot;EM!&quot;<br><br>&quot;What?&quot;<br><br>&quot;DETONATOR!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Whuh?&quot; Three inches of sword blade appeared by Em&#39;s right shoulder. &quot;Oh, yeah.

The agents walked down the stairs as the uncanonical room disappeared behind them, and they left the Kingsman tailors&#39; shop soon after, another well-dressed couple on a day out in London.<br><br>&quot;You know, we&#39;ve got the run of the city for a bit - the real city, not the Stu&#39;s version with all terrorists in it,&quot; said Cassie. &quot;Fancy lunch? I know this fantastic little pizza place in Euston-&quot;<br><br>&quot;You had me at lunch, hun. Girl&#39;s gotta eat!&quot; Em ruffled her partner&#39;s hair and didn&#39;t stop, loving the feel of the soft, brown curls against her fingertips.<br><br>&quot;I will too, Em.

            <p>Ah, this one got me good.  I only saw the first <i>Kingsman</i> movie soundless over someone&#39;s shoulder on an airplane, so I didn&#39;t recognize what was going on at all as this story opened.  I was thinking it was an original story, until the disguise change and charge list moment.  Looking back, I probably should have picked up on the Sueish traits in the Stormy character, especially some of his descriptions, but again, I didn&#39;t know the canon, so I didn&#39;t know what was &quot;acceptable.&quot;  All in all, a very excellent bait-and-switch.<br><br>I was also quite amused by the conversation between Cassie and Em while Stormy is breaking down the door.  Em just going on and on with her &quot;compliments&quot; obliviously.  Hee.  And it leads into a nice, sweet ending.<br><br>Just want to point out, in this one line:<br>&quot;&#39;. . . you are charged with bending the Kingsman canon into an n-dimensional pretzel . . .&#39;&quot;<br><i>Kingsman</i> should be italicized since it&#39;s being used as the title of the universe, rather being used in-universe as the organization.<br><br>—doctorlit currently views <i>Kingsman</i> as a silent film, but talkies are overrated, eh?</p>

            <p>“Thoth, how did you get your name?” Tom asked the question seemingly apropos of nothing.<br><br>Thoth sighed, not looking up from his book. His partner’s occasional and seemingly random enquiries resulted in discussions that were either mildly interesting or extremely irritating. This one seemed to be approaching tiresome. “‘Thoth’ was the name I took after my legion’s egress from the Imperium. It was the name of an ancient Terran god of knowledge, although many details regarding this god have been long forgotten. It is an arrogant name, perhaps, but it is better to appear pretentious then to show a lack of confidence. In most cases, at least.”<br><br>“You know, I’ve been reading about Thoth of late,” said Tom. “While it may be half-forgotten in your continuum, in World One knowledge of Egyptian mythology is still very much alive. It’s quite fascinating.”<br><br>Thoth looked up, at once intensely focused. “Might you provide me with such information?”<br><br>“Certainly!” Tom grinned, almost laughing. “Take the book. I’ve just been reading about Thoth’s origins, so that’s where the bookmark is.” He tossed a moderate-sized tome over to the Space Marine.<br><br>Thoth caught the book and began to read rapidly.<br><br>“Well?”<br><br>Thoth nodded. “Fascinating. I appreciate it.”<br><br>“You’re not going to—”<br><br>“No. The fact that you continue attempt to jab at me is more bothersome than the jabs themselves.”<br><br>Tom gave his most winning smile. “Well, I’m glad you enjoy the book at any rate, headchild.”<br><br>“Tom…” Thoth sighed. “Cease. It is pointless, and I am reading.”<br><br>Tom turned to his monitor. Sooner or later, he’d manage to get a reaction. And although he recognized this might be a bad idea, he found it amusing nonetheless.<br><br>--<br><br>This bit was prompted by a discussion on Discord. If you weren&#39;t there and don&#39;t study Egyptian mythology (I really don&#39;t know enough about the subject, given my name), you may be confused a bit as to what Tom&#39;s up to here. <br><br>Egyptian mythology is a confusing mess of entirely contradictory stories. However, one of the more popular versions of Thoth&#39;s origin is... extremely NSFW. <br><br>Tom continues to love jabbing Thoth with things, because He Is A Child.</p>

            <p>And Pratchett&#39;s not the only famous author to give similar advice.

            <p>RC 112358 echoed with the sound of a furious search. Drawers were being systematically opened, rummaged through, emptied, re-filled, closed, and then opened again several minutes later. Anything resembling a container in the room was checked and re-checked, including pockets. The beds and furniture were moved to check for the lost item. Peregrin even tried to move the console, which didn&#39;t budge, but it was worth a try. Throughout all this, muttered questions like &quot;now where did I leave...?&quot; and &quot;where could I have put...?&quot; could be heard, usually paired with Peregrin scratching his head or beard.<br><br>Peregrin scoured the room about two and a half times before coming to the conclusion that what he was looking for was likely not there. He stood around and tried to make a list of where he had been recently, and when he last remembered having this thing.<br><br>&quot;I had it out on the mission ... and then I put in that bag over there...&quot; he said, pointing at the bag and going to check it (which yielded no results) &quot;and then when we returned I went to ... where <i>did</i> I go? Rudi&#39;s, I believe. Or was it... Hm... . Either way, I took it out there, and so I did not leave it on the mission. I think. So where...?&quot;<br><br>Peregrin sat down on the floor, took some deep breaths, and tried to remember.<br><br>Right as he got to thinking, the RC&#39;s door opened. Taq walked in, looking as if he&#39;d just finished practicing with his sword - for that was what he had been doing.<br><br>&quot;Eh?&quot; Peregrin said, looking around. &quot;Oh, Taq! Would you happen to remember where our CAD is?&quot; he asked. &quot;I, ah,&quot; he looked down sheepishly, &quot;seem to have misplaced it.&quot;<br><br>Taq took a step back, just to make sure he was out of easy striking range. &quot;Sir, it exploded, sir. On th&#39; mission, sir. Ya took th&#39; bits t&#39; DoSAT, sir.&quot;<br><br>Peregrin stood up with his memory thoroughly jogged. &quot;Oh, yes, yes, it did. Right. Thank you for reminding me.&quot; He then walked over to a chalkboard that he&#39;d managed to get installed on one wall, circled something, and told the air &quot;So that experiment will need to be delayed to the arrival of a new CAD. So now ... oh, idea! What if the total flux through a stable plothole were non-zero. That would imply plotholes were directional, which is contradicted by, so no, unless... hold... it could be...&quot; All of this mathematics was accompanied by occasional marks on the chalkboard, which made no sense to anyone else, and often didn&#39;t make much sense to Peregrin a few days later either.<br><br>Taq, meanwhile, shrugged and walked back out of the RC after setting down his sword. This human the Flowers had put him under was weird, even by their standards, and Taq was not needed when he was like this. So, he went to go get a drink, wondering how Peregrin had managed to get promoted to any sort of senior position to distract himself on the way there.</p>

            <p>Fun little character piece for Peregrin.  There&#39;s a lot of stereotypical &quot;old wizard&quot; to him here, but I like that we get a glimpse of his experiments and thought process involving PPC tech and physics.<br><br>I also like that, in his dialogue where he tries to retrace his steps, you can see the point where he left the CAD at DoSAT, and he even knows that he took the CAD out at that location, but he just can&#39;t recall where it is.<br><br>—doctorlit has an idiot habit of leaving his cell phone protection case next to his other go-in-pockets-on-work-shift things, rather than next to the phone on his night stand, where it belongs</p>

            <p>Faolan&#39;s head jerked off her chest and her cheeks pinked when Jessica snickered beside her. &quot;Yes! Yes, sorry, what is it?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I asked you to pass your essay up,&quot; Professor Longbottom said gently.<br><br>&quot;Right, yes, of course,&quot; Faolan stammered, scrambling for her bag and digging through it. There were her textbooks, and her Charms essay, and her star chart for Astronomy that night, but her essay over fanged geraniums was nowhere to be found. &quot;Er.&quot; She looked up, face burning with embarrassment. &quot;I think I forgot it in my dorm, Professor.&quot;<br><br>Professor Longbottom nodded as he collected the remaining essays. &quot;Would you mind seeing me after class, Miss Saibhir?&quot;<br><br>She nodded, keeping her eyes on the table in front of her. Jessica leaned over to Denise and whispered something, and the two girls giggled.<br><br>The bell rang and students rose from their seats, and Professor Longbottom had to raise his voice to be heard over the clamor. &quot;Elspeth, ten points to Ravenclaw for answering all my questions correctly. Next week, we&#39;ll be starting on Screechsnaps, so don&#39;t come late!&quot;<br><br>Faolan slowly approached Professor Longbottom&#39;s desk, stifling a yawn. She&#39;d stayed up all night working on not just her essay, but Jessica&#39;s <i>and</i> Denise&#39;s <i>and</i> Alisha&#39;s. And tonight she had to do their manticore diagrams, and start on their Transfiguration homework—<br><br>She was jolted out of her thoughts when Professor Longbottom snapped his briefcase shut. &quot;I didn&#39;t want to say something in class that would be seen as favoritism,&quot; he began, &quot;but if you can run back to your dorm and bring me your essay before the end of lunch, I won&#39;t count you late.&quot;<br><br>Relief spread across Faolan&#39;s face and she nodded. &quot;Thank you, Professor,&quot; she said. &quot;I&#39;ll go get it right now—&quot;<br><br>She turned to leave, but Professor Longbottom cleared his throat. &quot;I hope you know you can talk to me if there&#39;s anything bothering you.&quot;<br><br>Faolan turned back, forcing a smile. &quot;Nothing&#39;s bothering me, Professor,&quot; she said, internally cringing at the thought of what her dorm mates might do to her if she tattled. &quot;But thank you for the offer.&quot;<br><br>Professor Longbottom studied her face, her gaunt cheeks and sunken eyes with their dark circles. He knew something most certainly <i>was</i> bothering the girl, but without seeing proof for himself, his hands were tied. &quot;Alright,&quot; he finally said. &quot;I&#39;ll see you later.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Bye,&quot; Faolan said, and bolted for the door. She had to get to her essay before her dorm mates could.<br><br>She sprinted across the grounds, praying nobody could be bothered to look twice at her lurching gait—up the wide stone steps—across the entrance hall—up another flight of stairs—another—another—<br><br>&quot;Doxy bites,&quot; she panted when she reached the portrait of the Fat Lady, and it swung open. She scrambled through the portrait hole and drew on her last reserves of energy to run up the stairs to the girls&#39; dorm, sending up a silent prayer of thanks that they hadn&#39;t decided to flatten on her today.<br><br>She was too late. Of course she was too late. Her bedside table was empty, and when she checked inside her trunk and under the bed, it was nowhere to be found.<br><br>Her dorm mates would be in the Great Hall now, she knew, and Caitlyn had taken to haunting the library in preparation for their O.W.L.s, so that refuge was no longer safe. Faolan trudged back down the stairs, resigned to spending another lunch period in Moaning Myrtle&#39;s bathroom.</p>

            <p>Oh, I really like your adult!Longbottom here.  He&#39;s very kind and considerate, and noticeably more confident and mature than when we saw him in his teenage years.  But he also still has that little familiar note of hesitation, and not wanting to insert himself too forcefully into another person&#39;s business.<br><br>Poor Ix.  I keep trying to think of a way to get them safely out of the clutches of the bullies, but . . . it&#39;s never that simple, is it?  But I like that we also clearly see their hard work ethic, even when it&#39;s piled up in much greater amounts than Ix can reasonably handle.  The detail that the dorm stairs sometimes deny Ix access based on their fluidity is fun, too.<br><br>—doctorlit, thinking Neville would make an excellently patient teacher</p>

            <p>Let me give you an update on what&#39;s happened in my absence.<br><br>I have a job, a driver&#39;s license, and a car! I&#39;m an electronics associate at Walmart, and I love working here. It makes my day knowing I&#39;ve made someone else&#39;s. I&#39;ve had my job for eight months, and my new set of wheels is a 2015 Nissan Versa.<br><br>Yes, my PPC stories have concluded. My family has Circle with Disney in place, which filters out a lot of websites. Everywhere I can get fanfiction is blocked, Google Hangouts doesn&#39;t work at home, and the Board itself was deliberately chosen to be filtered (I&#39;m posting this from my workplace). Because of all this, I can&#39;t really continue writing stories for the PPC.  Discord is also filtered, so I can&#39;t access that.<br><br>I can use Hangouts on my phone, though, so that&#39;s still an option for communication. If I don&#39;t respond for a while, you can probably assume that I&#39;m either asleep, at work, driving, or playing a game. Such as World of Warcraft.<br><br>Speaking of: Iximaz got me into World of Warcraft, and apparently I bit eatpraylove with the WoW bug as well! If anybody else here plays, my battletag is Voyd2194, and I usually play on Aerie Peak.<br><br>I apologize for not trying to touch base with everybody sooner. It&#39;s been so long that I&#39;d honestly be surprised if anybody remembers me, aside from the three people I&#39;ve kept in touch with after the Circle happened.</p>

            <p>I&#39;m not sure what to think of either of these, really. They both seem pretty alright, at least. I haven&#39;t listened to the song properly yet, so I can&#39;t say for sure.<br><br>The fic is... hm. I could be wrong, but this is an AAR, right? If so, I kind of have categorical issue with it, in that I&#39;m not sure what I&#39;d get out of reading this over playing my own game of Skyrim, as the mainline quest (probably the main aspect of what will be covered) doesn&#39;t, as I understand, vary that much from player to player. Am I wrong about this? I mean, sure I&#39;m getting a strong main character, who does seem interesting, and I&#39;m looking at their choices, but that doesn&#39;t really make up for the fact that were&#39;re going through the motions of a story I&#39;ve already seen. Part of the problem may be that I&#39;ve just been playing through Skyrim for the first time, so all this stuff is perfectly fresh in my mind. If that wasn&#39;t the case, I might have enjoyed the fic more. <br><br>Indeed, for what it is, it&#39;s a very well-written piece. The extra flourishes, things that aren&#39;t expressed in the game, work very well to give us a sense of who this character is. I&#39;m just not sure what it is satisfies me.</p>

            <p>As you&#39;ve explained it, yes and no. I&#39;m more or less in lockstep with the game in these first couple chapters, apart from the odd interjection of (what I hope reads as) sense and critical thought, but I expect it to diverge more the further I go.

            <p>AAR stands for &quot;After-Action Report&quot;. They&#39;re stories (or dry summaries, but usually stories) detailing the occurences inside of a gaming session. They often provide extra detail not given by the game, and they&#39;re frequently written from the perspective of the character, although not always.<br><br>They originated in the world of Wargaming (I think) and made the jump to RPGs quite easily. Only a few videogames really tend to produce them (Dwarf Fortress, and basically any game by Paradox (heck, they&#39;ve got a dedicated subforum for them), and that&#39;s mostly it). Anyways, here&#39;s a list of some famous/relevant ones and/or ones I happen to care about:<br><br>-Record of Lodoss War: One of the few commercial examples, this is a novel/anime/manga franchise from Japan. But the originals, as written in a magazine, were &quot;replays&quot; of a D&amp;D campaign between the author and his friends.<br><br>-Boatmurdered <a href="http://localhost:3000/posts/scrape/2018/a%20href=%22https://lparchive.org/Dwarf-Fortress-Boatmurdered/%22%3Ehttps://lparchive.org/Dwarf-Fortress-Boatmurdered/%3C/a">language</a>: There are many Dwarf Fortress Let&#39;s Play/AARs. There are many pass-the-save-file Dwarf Fortress games. Many of them are legendary. But Boatmurdered stands head and shoulders above the rest as easily the most famous. Probably because of just how much went <i>wrong</i> as anything else. Seriously. It was an unmitigated disaster of the sort that must be seen to be believed.<br><br>-By definition, every Nuzlocke Comic.<br><br>-Knud Knytling Prince Of Denmark (<a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/index.php?threads/knud-kn%C3%BDtling-prince-of-denmark-and-other-assorted-tales.235468/"><a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/index.php?threads/knud-kn%C3%BDtling-prince-of-denmark-and-other-assorted-tales.235468/">https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/index.php?threads/knud-knýtling-prince-of-denmark-and-other-assorted-tales.235468/</a></a>): This list wouldn&#39;t be complete without a Paradox game AAR. So here&#39;s an old one. It should give you a feel for at least one style from that AAR community. It&#39;s also really funny.<br><br>-The All Guardsman Party <a href="http://localhost:3000/posts/scrape/2018/a%20href=%22http://www.theallguardsmenparty.com%22%3Ehttp://www.theallguardsmenparty.com%3C/a">NSFW</a>: A personal favorite. Boatmurdered came from SomethingAwful, this one comes from its estranged child, 4chan. Don&#39;t worry, it&#39;s not as bad as that makes it sound. But it is hilarious, insane, bizarre, and full of Discworld references. As in, one of the PCs is a Nobby expy. Also, it&#39;s getting a new chapter tonight. So I&#39;m watching for that. :-)<br><br>Happy reading, everyone!</p>

She has a shield bash that can be used to stun and knock back enemies, and basically, I think I&#39;m in love already.</p>
